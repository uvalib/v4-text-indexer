      <field name="fulltext">[Volume I.] From the time of Oliver Cromwell to the Abdication of K. James the Second. [The First Part.] A Panegyrick on O. Cromwell, and his Victories. By E. Waller, Esq;. While with a strong, and yet a gentle Hand, You bridle Faction, and our Hearts Command; Protect us from our selves, and from the Foe; Make us Unite, and make us Conquer too. Let partial Spirits still aloud complain, Think themselves injur'd that they cannot Reign And own no Liberty, but where they may, Without controul upon their fellows Prey. Above the Waves as Neptune shew'd his Face, To chide the Winds, and save the Trojan Race. So has your Highness (rais'd above the rest,) Storms of Ambition tossing us Repest. Your drooping Country, torn with Civil hate, Restor'd by you, is made a glorious State: The Seat of Empire, where the Irish come, And the unwilling Scot, to fetch their Doom. The Sea's our own, and now all Nations greet With bending Sails, each Vessel of our Fleet. Your Pow'r resounds as far as Wind can Blow, Or swelling Sails upon the Globe may go. Heaven that has plac'd this Island to give Law, To ballance Europe, and her State to awe: In this Conjunction does our Britain Smile, The greatest Leader to the greatest Isle. Whether this Portion of the World were rent By the whide Ocean from the Continent; Or thus created, it was sure design'd, To be the Sacred Refuge of Mankind. Hither the Opprest shall henceforth resort, Justice to crave, and succour of your Court, And shew, your Highness, not for ours alone, But for the World's Protector shall be known. Fame, swifter than your winged Navy flies Through every Land that near the Ocean lies; Sounding your Name, and telling dreadful News To all that Piracy and Rapine use: With such a Chief the meanest Nation blest, Might hope to lift her Head above the rest. What may be thought impossible to do For us, embraced by the Sea and you? Lords of the World's great Wast, the Ocean, we Whole Forests send to Reign upon the Sea: And every Coast may trouble and relieve, But none can visit us without your leave. Angels and we know this Prerogative, That none can at our happy Seat arrive; While we Descend at pleasure to invade The bad with Vengeance, or the good to Aid; Our little World, the Image of the great, Like that amidst the boundless Ocean set, Of her own growth has all that Nature craves, And all that's Rare, as Tribute from the Waves. As Egypt does not on the Clouds rely: But to the Nile owes more than to the Sky; So what our Heaven, or what our Earth denies, Our ever constant Friend, the Sea supplies. The Taste of hot Arabia's Spice we know, Free from the scorching Sun that makes it grow. Without the Worm in Persian Silks we shine, And without Planting, Drink of every Vine. To dig for Wealth we weary not our Limbs; Gold, though the heaviest Metal, hither Swims. Ours is the Harvest, where the Indians Mow; We Plough the Deep, and Reap what others Sow; Things of the noblest kind our own Soil breeds; Stout are our Men, and Warlike are our Steeds; Rome, though her Eagle through the World had flown, Could never make this Island all her own. Here the Third Edward, and the Black Prince too; France-Conquering Henry flourisht, and now You. For whom we staid, as did the Grecian State, Till Alexander came to urge their Fate. When for more Worlds that Macedonian cry'd, He wist not Thetis in her Lap did hide Another yet, a World reserv'd for you, To make more great than that he did subdue. He safely might Old Troops to Battel lead Against the unwarlike Persian, or the Mede, Whose hasty flight did from a bloodless Field More Spoil than Honour to the Victor yield. A Race unconquer'd by their Clime—made bold, The Calydonians arm'd with want and cold, Have by a Fate indulgent to your Fame, Been from all Ages kept for you to tame: Whom the old Roman Wall so ill confin'd, With a new Chain of Garisons you bind. Here Foreign Gold no more shall make them come, Our English Iron holds them fast at home. They that henceforth must be content to know No warmer Region than their Hills of Snow, May blame the Sun, but must extol your Grace, Which in our Senate hath allow'd them place. Prefer'd by Conquest, happily o'rethrown; Falling they rise, to be with us made one. So kind Dictators made, when they came home, Their vanquish'd Foes free Citizens of Rome. Like favour find the Irish, with like Fate Advanc'd to be a Portion of our State, While by your Valour, and your courteous Mind, Nations divided by the Sea, are joyn'd. Holland to gain your Friendship, is content To be our Out-guard on your Continent. She from her fellow Provinces would go, Rather than hazard to have you her Foe. In our late Fight, when Cannons did diffuse Preventing Posts, the terror of the News, Our Neighbour-Provinces trembl'd at their roar, But our conjunction makes them tremble more. Your never-failing Sword made War to cease, And now you heal us with the Arts of Peace; Our Minds with bounty and with awe engage, Unite Affections, and restrain our Rage. Less pleasures take brave minds in Battel won, Than in restoring such as are undone. Tygers have courage, and the rugged Bear, But Man alone can whom he conquers spare: To pardon willing, and to punish loath, You strike with one hand, but you heal with both. Lifting up all that prostrate lye you grieve, You cannot make the dead again to live. When Fate or Error had our Age misled, And o're these Nations such Confusion spread, The only Cure which could from Heaven come down Was so much Power and Clemency in one; One whose Extraction is from an Ancient Line, Gives hope again that well-born Men may shine: The meanest in your Nature, mild and good, The noble rest secur'd in your Blood. Oft have we wonder'd how you hid in Peace A Mind proportion'd to such things as these: How such a Ruling Spirit could restrain, And practice first o're your own self to Reign. Your private Life did a just Pattern give, How Fathers, Husbands, Pious Sons should live. Born to Command, your Princely Vertues slept Like humble David, whilst the Flock he kept; But when your troubled Country call'd you forth, Your flaming Courage, and your matchless Worth Dazling the Eyes of all that did pretend To sow Contention—gave a prosperous end, Still as you rise, the States exalted too, Finds no Distemper while it's chang'd by you: Chang'd like the World's great Scene, when without noise The rising Sun Night's vulgar Lights destroys. Had you some Ages past this Race of Glory Run, with amazement we should read your Story. But living Vertue all Atchievements past, Meets Envy still to grapple with at last. This Cæsar found, and that ungrateful Age With losing him, fell back to Blood and Rage. Mistaken Brutus thought to break their Yoak, But cut the Bond of Union at that stroke. That Sun once set, a thousand meaner Stars Gave a dim light to Violence and Wars. To such a Tempest as now threatens all, Did not your mighty Arm prevent the fall. If Rome's great Senate could not wield the Sword, Which of the conquer'd World had made them Lord, What hope had ours, while yet their power was new, To Rule victorious Armies, but by you? You that had taught them to subdue their Foes, Could Order teach, and all their Hearts compose. To every Duty could their Minds engage, Provoke their Courage, and commend their Rage. So when a Lion shakes his dreadful Main, And angry grows, if he that first took pain To tame his Youth, approach the haughty Beast, He bends to him, but frights away the rest. As the vext World, to find repose at last, It self into Augusta's Arms did cast. So England now, does, with like Toyl opprest, Her weary Head upon your Bosom rest. Then let the Muses with such Notes as these, Instruct us what belongs unto our Peace: Your Battles they hereafter shall indite, And draw the Image of our Mars in Fight; Tell of Towns storm'd, of Armies over-run, And mighty Kingdoms by your Conduct won: How, while you Thunder'd, Clouds of Dust did choak Contending Troops, and Seas lay hid in Smoak. Illustrious Arts high raptures do infuse, And every Conqueror creates a Muse. Here in low strains your milder Deeds we Sing; But there, my Lord, we'll Bays and Olives bring To Crown your Head, while you in Triumph ride O're vanquish'd Nations, and the Sea beside: While all your Neighbour-Princes unto You, Like Joseph's Sheaves, pay Reverence, and Bow. Three POEMS on the Death of the late Protector, Oliver Cromwell. Written by Mr. John Dryden, Mr. Sprat of Oxford, and Mr. Edm. Waller Heroick Stanza's, on the late Usurper Oliver Cromwell: Written after his Funeral, by Mr. Dryden. I And now 'tis time; for their officious hast, Who would before have born him to the Sky, Like eager Romans, e're all Rites were past, Did let too soon the sacred Eagle fly. II Though our best Notes are Treason to his Fame, Join'd with the loud applause of publick Voice; Since Heaven, what Praise we offer to his Name, Hath render'd too Authentick by its choice. III Though in his praise no Arts can liberal be, Since they whose Muses have the highest flown; Add not to his Immortal Memory, But do an Act of Friendship to their own. IV Yet 'tis our Duty, and our int'rest too, Such Monuments as we can build, to raise, Lest all the World prevent what we should do, And claim a Title in him by their Praise. V How shall I then begin, or where conclude, To draw a Fame so truely Circular? For in a round, what order can be shew'd, Where all the parts so equal perfect are? VI His Grandure he deriv'd from Heaven alone, For he was great e're Fortune made him so, And Wars like Mists that rise against the Sun, Made him but greater seem, nor greater grow. VII No borrow'd Bays his Temples did adorn, But to our Crown he did fresh Jewels bring; Nor was his Vertue poison'd soon as born. With the too early thoughts of being King. VIII Fortune (that easie Mistriss to the young, But to her ancient Servants coy and hard) Him, at that age, her Favourites rank'd among, When she her best lov'd Pompey did discard. IX He private, mark'd the Faults of others sway, And set as Sea-marks for himself to shun; Not like rash Monarchs, who their youth betray, By Acts their Age too late would wish undone. X And yet Dominion was not his design, We owe that blessing not to him but Heaven, Which to fair acts unsought rewards did join; Rewards that less to him, than us were given. XI Our former Chief like Sticklers of the War, First sought t'inflame the parties, then to poise: The quarrel lov'd, but did the cause abhor, And did not strike to hurt, but make a noise. XII War, our Consumption, was their gainful Trade; He inward bled, whilst they prolong'd our pain; He fought to hinder fighting, and assay'd To stanch the blood by breathing of the Vein. XIII Swift and resistless through the Land he past, Like that bold Greek, who did the East subdue, And made to Battels such Heroick haste, As if on Wings of Victory he flew. XIV He Fought secure of Fortune as of Fame, Still by new Maps the Island might be shewn, Of Conquests which he strew'd were e're he came, Thick as the Galaxy with Stars is sown. XV His Palms, though under weights they did not stand, Still thriv'd, no Winter could his Lawrels fade: Heaven in his Portraict shew'd a Workman's hand, And drew it perfect, yet without a shade. XVI Peace was the prize of all his toil and care, Which War had banish'd, and did now restore: Bolognia's Walls thus mounted in the Air, To seat themselves more surely than before. XVII Her safety rescued Ireland, to him owes, And treacherous Scotland to no int'rest true. Yet bless'd that Fate which did his Arms dispose Her Land to civilize, as to subdue. XVIII Nor was he like those Stars which only shine, When to pale Mariners, they Storms portend; He had his calmer influence, and his Mien Did Love and Majesty together blend. XIX Tis true his Countenance did imprint an awe. And naturally all Souls to his did bow, As wands of Divination downward draw, And point to beds where Sov'raign Gold doth grow. XX When past all offerings to Pheretrian Jove, He Mars depos'd, and Arms to Gowns made yield; Successful Councels did him soon approve, As fit for close Intrigues, as open Field. XXI To suppliant Holland he vouchsaf'd a Peace, Our once bold Rival in the British Main, Now tamely glad her unjust claim to cease, And buy our Friendship with her Idol, Gain. XXII Fame of th'asserted Sea through Europe blown, Made France and Spain ambitious of his Love; Each knew that side must conquer, he Would own; And for him fiercely, as for Empire strove. XXIII No sooner was the French-man's Cause imbrac'd, Than the light Monsieur, the grave Don outweigh'd; His Fortune turn'd the Scale where it was cast, Though Indian Mines where in the other laid. XXIV When absent, yet we conquer'd in his Right; For though that some mean Artist's Skill were shewn In mingling Colours, or in placing Light; Yet still the fair Designment was his own: XXV For from all Tempers he could Service draw; The worth of each with its allay he knew; And as the Confident of Nature saw How she Complections did divide and brew. XXIV Or he their single Vertues did survey, By intuition in his own large Breast, Where all the rich Idea's of them lay, That were the Rule and Measure to the rest. XXVII When such Heroick Vertue, Heaven set out, The Stars, like Commons, sullenly obey; Because it drains them when it comes about, And therefore is a Tax they seldom pay. XXVIII From this high Spring our Foreign Conquests flow, Which yet more glorious Triumphs do portend; Since their Commencement to his Arms they owe, If Springs as high as Fountains may Ascend. XXIX He made us Free-Men of the Continent, Whom Nature did like Captives treat before; To Nobler preys the English Lion sent, And taught him first in Belgian Walks to Roar. XXX That old unquestion'd Pirate of the Land, Proud Rome, with dread the Fate of Dunkirk heard; And trembling wish'd behind more Alps to stand, Although an Alexander were her Guard. XXXI By his Command, we boldly cross'd the Line, And bravely fought where Southern Stars arise, We trac'd the far-fetch'd Gold unto the Mine, And that which brib'd our Fathers made our Prize. XXXII Such was our Prince, yet own'd a Soul above The highest Acts it could produce or shew: Thus poor Mechanick Arts in publick move, Whilst the deep Secrets beyond Practice go. XXXIII Nor died he when his ebbing Fame went less, But when fresh Laurels courted him to live; He seem'd but to prevent some new Success, As if above what Triumphs Earth can give. XXXIV His latest Victories still thickest came, As near the Center, Motion doth increase; Till he press'd down by his own weighty Name, Did like the Vestal, under spoils decease. XXXV But first the Ocean as a Tribute sent. That Giant Prince of all her wat'ry Herd; And th'Isle, when her protecting Genius went, Upon his Obsequies loud sighs conferr'd. XXXVI No civil Broils have since his Death arose, But Faction now by habit does obey; And Wars have that respect for his Repose, As Winds for Halcyons, when they breed at Sea. XXXVII His Ashes in a peaceful Urn shall rest, His Name a great Example stands to shew, How strangely high Endeavours may be blest, Where Piety and Valour jointly go. To the happy Memory of the late Usurper. Oliver Cromwell. By Mr. Sprat of Oxon Pindarick Odes. I. 'Tis true, grate Name, thou art secure From the forgetfulness and Rage Of Death, or Envy, or devouring Age; Thou canst the Force and Teeth of Time endure: Thy Fame like Men, the Elder it doth grow, Will of its self turn whither too, Without what needless Art can do; Will live beyond thy breath, beyond thy Hearse, Tho it were never heard or sung in Verse. Without our help, thy Memory is safe; They only want an Epitaph, That does remain alone Alive in an Inscription, Remembred only on the Brass, or Marble stone. 'Tis all in vain what we can do: All our Roses and Perfumes Will but officious folly shew, And pious Nothings, to such mighty Tombs. All our Incense, Gums, and Balm, Are but unnecessary duties here: The Poets may their Spices spare, Their costly numbers and their tuneful Feet: That need not be imbalm'd, which of it self is Sweet. II. We know to Praise thee is a dangerous proof Of our Obedience and our Love: For when the Sun and Fire meet, Th'ones extinguish'd quite; And yet the other never is more bright: So that they write of thee, and join Their feeble names with thine, Their weaker sparks with thy Illustrious light, Will lose themselves in that ambitious thought; And yet no Fame to thee from hence he brought, We know, bless'd Spirit, thy mighty name Wants no addition of anothers beam; It's for our Pens to high, and full of Theme: The Muses are made great by thee, not thou by them. Thy Fame's Eternal Lamp will live, And in thy Sacred Urn survive, Without the food of Oyl, which we can give. 'Tis true; but yet our duty calls our Songs, Duty Commands our Tongues. Though thou want not our praises, we Are not excus'd for what we owe to thee; For so Men from Religion are not freed. but from the Altars Clouds must rise, Though Heaven it self doth nothing need, And though the Gods don't want an earthly Sacrifice. III. Great Life of wonders, whose each year Full of new Miracles did appear! Whose every Month might be Alone a Chronicle, or a History! Others great Actions are But thinly scatter'd here and there; At best, but all one single Star; But thine the Milky-way, All one continued light, of undistinguish'd Day; They throng'd so close, that naught else could be seen, Scarce any common Sky did come between: What shall I say or where begin? Thou may'st in double shapes be shown, Or in thy Arms, or in thy Gown; Like Jove sometimes with Warlike Thunder, and Sometimes with peaceful Scepter in his Hand; Or in the Field, or on the Throne. In what thy Head or what thy Arm hath done, All that thou dist was so refin'd, So full of substance, and so strongly join'd, So pure, so weighty Gold, That the least Grain of it If fully spread and beat, Would many Leaves and mighty Volums hold. IV. Before thy Name was publish'd, and whilst yet Thou only to thy self wer't great, Whilst yet thy happy bud Was not quite seen, or understood, It then sure signs of future greatness shew'd: Then thy Domestick worth Did tell the World what it would be, When it should fit occasion see, When a full Spring should call it forth: As Bodies in the Dark and Night, Have the same Colours, the same red and white, As in the open Day and Light, The Sun doth only shew That they are bright, not make them so: So whilst but private Walls did know What we to such a mighty Mind should owe, Then the same Vertues did appear, Though in a less and more contracted Sphere, As full, though not as large as since they were: And like great Rivers, Fountains, though At first so deep thou didst not go; Though then thine was not so inlarg'd a Flood; Yet when 'twas little, 'twas as clear as good. V. 'Tis true, thou wast not born unto a Crown, Thy Scepter's not thy Fathers, but thy own. Thy purple was not made at once in haste, And after many other Colours past. It took the deepest Princely Dye at last. Thou didst begin with lesser Cares, And private thoughts took up thy private Years: Those Hands, which were ordain'd by Fates, To change the World, and alter States, Practis'd at first that vast Design On meaner things with equal Mind. That Soul, which should so many Scepters sway, To whom so many Kingdoms should obey, Learned first to rule in a Domestick way: So Government it self, began From Family, and single Man, Was by the small Relation, first, Of Husband, and of Father Nurs'd, And from those less beginnings past, To spread it self o'er all the World at last. VI. But when thy Country, (then almost enthrall'd) Thy Vertue, and thy Courage call'd; When England did thy Arms intreat, And't had been Sin in thee not to be Great: When every Stream, and every Flood, Was a true Vein of Earth, and run with Blood; When unus'd Arms, and unknown War Fill'd every Place, and every Ear; When the great Storms, and dismal Night Did all the Land affright; 'Twas time for thee, to bring forth all our Light. Thou left'st thy more delightful Peace, Thy private Life, and better case; Then down thy Steel and Armour took, Wishing that it still hung upon the Hook: When Death had got a large Commission out, Throwing her Arrows, and her Sting about; Then thou (as once the healing Serpent rose) Wast lifted up, not for thy self, but us. VII. 'Thy Country wounded was, and sick before Thy Wars and Arms did her restore: Thou knew'st where the Disease did lie, And like the Cure of Sympathy, Thy strong, and certain Remedy: Unto the Weapon didst apply; 'Thou didst not draw the Sword, and so Away the Scabbard throw, As if thy Country shou'd Be the Inheritance of Mars and Blood: But that when the great work was spun, War in it self should be undone; That Peace might Land again upon the shore, Richer and better than before: The Husbandmen no Steel should know, None but the useful iron of the Plow; That Bays might creep on every Spear: And though our Sky was overspread With a destructive red; 'Twas but till thou our Sun didst in full Light appear. VIII. When Ajax died, the Purple Blood That from his gaping Wound had flow'd, Turn'd into Letters every Leaf Had on it wrote his Epitaph: So from that Crimson Flood, which thou, by fate of times, wert led Unwillingly to shed, Letters, and Learning rose, and renewed: Thou fought'st not out of Envy, Hope, or Hate, But to refine the Church and State; And like the Romans, what e'er thou In the Field of Mars didst mow, Was, that a holy Island hence might grow. Thy Wars, as Rivers raised by a Shower, With welcome Clouds do pour: Though they at first may seem, To carry all away with an inraged Stream; Yet did not happen that they might destroy, Or the better parts annoy: But all the Filth and Mud to Scour, And leave behind another slime, To give a Birth to a more happy Power. IX. In Fields unconquer'd, and so well Thou did'st in Battels and in Arms excel; That steelly Arms themselves, might be Worn out in War as soon as thee. Success, so close upon thy Troops did wait, As if thou first had'st Conquer'd Fate; As if uncertain Victory Had been first overcome by thee; As if her Wings were clipp'd, and could not flee, Whilst thou did'st only serve, Before thou had'st what first thou did'st deserve. Others by thee did great things do, Triumph'd'st thy self, and madest them triumph too; Though they above thee did appear, As yet in a more large and higher Sphere: Thou, the great Sun gav'st Light to every Star. Thy self an Army wert alone, And mighty Troops contain'd'st in one: Thy only Sword did guard the Land, Like that which flaming in the Angel's Hand, From Men Gods Garden did defend: But yet thy Sword did more than his, Not only Guarded, but did make this Land a Paradice. X. Thou fought'st not to be high or great, Not for a Scepter or a Crown, Or Ermyn, Purple, or the Throne; But as the Vestal Heat, Thy Fire was kindled from above alone; Religion putting on thy Shield, Brought thee Victorious to the Field. Thy Arms like those, which ancient Heroes wore, Were given by the God thou did'st adore; And all the Words thy Armies had, Were on an heavenly Anvil made; Not Int'rest, or any weak desire Of Rule, or Empire did thy mind inspire; Thy Valour like the holy Fire, Which did before the Persian Armies go, Liv'd in the Camp, and yet was Sacred too: Thy mighty Sword anticipates, What was reserv'd for Heaven and those bless'd Seats, And makes the Church Triumphant here below. XI. Though Fortune did hang on thy Sword, And did obey thy mighty Word; Though Fortune for thy side and thee, Forgot her lov'd Unconstancy; Amidst thy Arms and Trophies thou Wert valiant and gentle too, Wounded'st thy self, when thou did'st kill thy Foe; Like Steel, when it much Work has past, That which was rough does shine at last: Thy Arms by being oftner us'd did smoother grow Nor did thy Battels make thee proud or high, Thy Conquest rais'd the State, not thee: Thou overcam'st thy self in every Victory: As when the Sun, in a directer Line, Upon a polish'd golden Shield doth shine, The Shield reflects unto the Sun again his Light: So when the Heavens smil'd on thee in Fight, When thy propitious God had lent Success, and Victory to thy Tent; To Heav'n again the Victory was sent. XII. England till thou did'st come, Confin'd her Valour home; Then our own Rocks did stand Bounds to our Fame as well as Land, And were to us as well, As to our Enemies unpassable. We were asham'd at what we read, And blush'd at what our Fathers did, Because we came so far behind the Dead. The British Lion hung his main, and droop'd, To Slavery and Burthen stoop'd, With a degenerate Sleep and Fear Lay in his Den, and languish'd there; At whose least Voice before, A trembling eccho ran through every Shore, And shook the World at every Roar: Thou his subdued Courage didst restore, Sharpen his Claws, and in his Eyes Mad'st the same dreadful Lightning rise; Mad'st him again affright the Neighbouring Floods, His mighty Thunder sounds through all the Woods: Thou hast our Military Fame redeem'd, Which was lost, or clouded seem'd: Nay more, Heaven did by thee bestow On us, at once an Iron Age, and happy too. XIII. Till thou command'st, that Azure Chain of Waves, Which Nature round about us sent, Made us to every Pirate Slaves, Was rather Burthen than an Ornament; Those Fields of Sea that wash'd our Shores, Were plow'd, and reap'd by other Hand than ours: To us, the liquid Mass, Which doth about us run, As it is to the Sun, Only a Bed to sleep on was: And not, as now a powerful Throne, To shake and sway the World thereon. Our Princes in their Hand a Globe did shew, But not a perfect one, Compos'd of Earth, and Water too. But thy Commands the Floods obey'd, Thou all the Wilderness of Water sway'd; Thou did'st but only wed the Sea, Not make her equal, but a Slave to thee. Neptune himself did bear thy Yoke, Stoop'd, and trembled at thy stroke. He that ruled all the Main, Acknowledg'd thee his Soveraign: And now the Conquer'd Sea doth pay More Tribute to thy Thames, than that unto the Sea. XIV. 'Till now our Valour did our selves more hurt; Our Wounds to other Nations were a sport; And as the Earth, our Land produc'd Iron and Steel, which should to tear our selves be us'd Our strength within it self did break Like thundring Canons crack, And kill'd those that were near, While the Enemies secur'd and untouch'd were. But now our Trumpets thou hast made to sound Against our Enemies Walls in Foreign Ground; And yet no eccho back to us returning found. England is now the happy peaceful Isle, And all the World the while, Is exercising Arms and Wars With Foreign, or intestine Jars. The Torch extinguish'd here, we lend to others Oil, We give to all, yet know our selves no Fear; We reach the Flame of Ruine, and of Death, Where e're we please, our Swords to unsheath, Whilst we in calm, and temperate Regions breath: Like to the Sun, whose heat is hurl'd Through every Corner of the World; Whose Flame through all the Air doth go, And yet the Sun himself, the while no Fire doth know. XV. Besides the Glories of thy Peace, Are not in Number, nor in value less. Thy Hand did cure, and close the Scars Of our bloody Civil Wars; Not only lanc'd, but heal'd the Wound, Made us again as healthy, and as sound, When now the Ship was well nigh Lost, After the Storm upon the Coast, By 'its Mariners endanger'd most: When they their Ropes and Helms had left, When the Planks asunder cleft, And Flouds came roaring in with mighty sound, Thou a safe Land, and harbour for us found, And saved'st those that would themselves have drown'd: A Work which none but Heven and thee could do, Thou made'st us happy whe'r we would or no; Thy Judgment, Mercy, Temperance so great, As if those Vertues only in thy Mind had seat: Thy Piety not only in the Field, but Peace, When Heaven seemed to be wanted least: Thy Temples not like Janus open were, Open in time of War, When thou hadst greater cause of fear, Religion and the awe of Heaven possest All places and all times alike thy Breast. XVI. Nor didst thou only for thy age provide, But for the years to come beside; Our after-times, and late Posterity, Shall pay unto thy Fame as much as we; They two are made by thee. When Fate did call thee to a higher Throne, And when thy Mortal Work was done; When Heaven did say it, and thou must be gone, Thou him to bear thy burthen chose, Who might (if any could) make us forget thy loss; Nor hadst thou him design'd, Had he not been Not only to thy Blood, but Vertue kin; Not only Heir unto thy Throne, but Mind, 'Tis he shall perfect all thy Cures, And with as fine a thread weave out thy Loom: So one did bring the chosen People from Their Slavery and Fears, Led them through their pathless Road, Guided himself by God. He brought them to the Borders; but a second Hand Did settle, and secure them in the promised Land. Upon the late Storm, and Death of the late Usurper Oliver Cromwell ensuing the same, By Mr. Waller. We must resign; Heav'n his great Soul does claim In Storms as loud, as his Immortal Fame; His dying Groans, his last breath shakes our Isle, And Trees uncut fall for his Funeral Pile. About his Palace their broad roots are tost Into the Air: So Romulus was lost. New Rome in such a Tempest mist their King, And from obeying fell to Worshipping. On Oeta's top thus Hercules lay Dead, With ruin'd Oaks and Pines about him spread; The Poplar too, whose Bough he wont to wear On his Victorious Head, lay prostrate there: Those his last Fury from the Mountain rent; Our dying Hero, from the Continent, Ravish'd whole Towns, and Forts from Spaniards rest, As his last Legacy to Britain left; The Ocean which so long our hopes confin'd, Could give no limits to his vaster Mind; Our bounds inlargement, was his latest Toil, Nor hath he left us Prisoners to our Isle: Under the Tropick is our Language spoke, And part of Flanders hath receiv'd our Yoke. From Civil broils, he did us disingage, Found nobler Objects for our Martial Rage; And with wise Conduct to his Country shew'd, Their ancient way of Conquering abroad: Ungrateful then, if we no tears allow To him, that gave us Peace and Empire too: Princes that fear'd him, griev'd, concern'd to see No pitch of Glory from the Grave is free; Nature her self, took notice of his Death, And sighing swell'd the Sea with such a-breath, That to remotest Shores her Billows rowl'd, Th'approaching Fate of her great Ruler told. Directions to a Painter. By Sir John Denham. 1667. Nay Painter, if thou dar'st design that Fight, Which Waller only Courage had to write; If thy bold Hands can without shaking draw, What ev'n th'Actors trembled at when they saw, Enough to make thy colours change like theirs, And all thy Pencils bristle like their Hairs. First in fit distance of the prospect main, Paint Allen tilting at the Coast of Spain; Heroick Act! and never heard till now! Stemming of Herc'les Pillars with the Prow! And how he left his Ship the Hills to waft, And with new Sea-marks Cales and Dover graft. Next let the flaming London come in view, Like Nero's Rome, burnt to re-build it new; What lesser Sacrifice than this was meet To offer for the safety of the Fleet? Blow one Ship up, another thence will grow: See what free Cities and wise Courts can do! So some old Merchant, to insure his Name, Marries afresh, and Courtiers share the Dame: So whatsoe'er is broke, the Servants pay't, And Glasses are more durable than Plate. No May'r till now, so rich a Pageant feign'd, Nor one Barge all the Companies contain'd. Then Painter, draw Cerulean Coventry, Keeper, or rather Chancellour o'th' Sea; And more exactly to express his hue Use nothing but Ultra-Marinish Blue. To pay his Fees, the Silver Trumpet spends, And Boat-swains whistle, for his place depends, Pilots in vain repeat their Compass o'er Until of him they learn that one point more. The constant Magnet to the Pole doth hold, Steel to the Magnet, Coventry to Gold. Muscovy sells us Pitch, and Hemp, and Tar; Iron and Copper, Sweden; Munster, War; Ashly, Prize; Warwick, Customs; Cart'ret, Pay; But Coventry doth sell the Fleet away. Now let our Navy stretch its Canvas Wings, Swoln like his purse, with tackling like his strings, By slow degrees of the increasing gale, First under Sail, and after under Sale: Then in kind visit unto Opdam's Gout, Hedge the Dutch in, only to let them out. So Huntsmen fair unto the Hares give Law, First find them, and then civilly withdraw. That the blind Archer when they take the Seas, The Hambrough Convoy may betray with ease. So that the Fish may more securely bite, The Angler baits the River over Night. But Painter, now prepare t'enrich thy piece, Pencil of Ermins, Oyl of Ambergreece, See where the Dutchess with Triumphant trail Of numerous Coaches, Harwich does assail! So the Land-Crabs, at Natures kindly call, Down to ingender to the Sea do Crawl. See then the Admiral with Navy whole, To Harwich through the Ocean carry Coal: So Swallows buried in the Sea at Spring, Return to Land with Summer in their Wing. One thrifty Ferry-boat of Mother Pearl, Suffic'd of old, the Citherean Girl; Yet Navies are but Fopperies when here, A small Sea-Mask, and built to Court your Dear: Three Goddesses in one, Pallas for Art, Venus for sport, but Juno in your Heart. O Dutchess! if thy Nuptial Pomp was mean, 'Tis paid with Interest in thy Naval Scene. Never did Roman Mark within the Nile, So Feast the fair Ægyptian Crocodile; Nor the Venetian Duke with such a State The Adriatick Marry, at that rate. Now Painter, spare thy weaker Art; forbear To draw her parting Passions and each Tear: For Love, alas! hath but a short Delight; The Sea, the Dutch, the King, all call'd to Fight. She therefore the Dukes Person recommends To Brunker, Pen, and Coventry, her Friends; To Pen much, Brunker more, most Coventry; For they she knew were all more fraid then he: Of flying Fishes one had sav'd the Fin, And hop'd by this he through the Air might Spin; The other thought he might avoid the Knell, By the invention of the Diving Bell; The third had try'd it, and affirm'd a Cable Coyled round about him, was impenetrable. But these the Duke rejected, only chose To keep far off; let others interpose. Rupert, that knew no fear, but Health did want, Kept State suspended in a Chair volant; All save his Head shut in that wooden case, He shew'd but like a broken Weather-glass; But arm'd with the whole Lyon Cap-a-Chin, Did represent the Hercules within. Dear shall the Dutch his twinging anguish know, And see what Valour whet with pain can do. Curst in the mean time be that treach'rous Jael, That through his Princely Temples drove the Nail. Rupert resolv'd to fight it like a Lyon; And Sand?ch hop'd to fight it like Arion; He to prolong his Life in the dispute, And charm the Holland Pirates, tun'd his Lute, Till some judicious Dolphin might approach, And land him safe and sound as any Roach. Now Painter, reassume thy Pencils care, Thou hadst but skirmish'd yet, now fight prepare; And draw the Battle terrible to shew, As the last Judgment was of Angelo. First let our Navy scour through Silver Froth, The Oceans burthen, and the Kingdoms both; Whose very bulk may represent its Birth, From Hide and Paston, burthens of the Earth; Hide whose Transcendent panch so swells of late, That he the Rupture seems of Law and State; Paston whose Belly bears more Millions, Than Indian Carrocks, and contains more Tuns. Let shoals of Porpoises on every side Wonder in Swimming by our Oaks out-vy'd; And the Sea-fowl all gaze, t'behold a thing So vast, more swift and strong then they of Wing. But yet presaging George they keep in sight, And follow for the Reliques of a Fight. Then let the Dutch with well-dissembled fear, Or bold despair, more than we wish, draw near: At which our Gallants, to the Sea but tender, And more to fight their easie Stomachs render, With Breasts so panting, that at every stroke You might have felt their Hearts beat through the Oak: While one concerned in the Interval Of straining Choler, thus did vent his Gall. Noah be damn'd! and all his Race accurst, Who in Sea brine did pickle Timber first! What though he Planted Vines, he Pines cut down, He taught us how to Drink and how to Drown: He first built Ships, and in his Wooden Wall, Saving but eight, e're since endanger'd all. And thou Dutch Necromantick Fryar, be damn'd, And in thine own first-Mortar-piece be ram'd! Who first invented Cannon in thy Cell, Nitre from Earth, and Brimstone fetcht from Hell. But damn'd and treble damn'd be Clarendine, Our seventh Edward, with all his House and Line! Who to divert the danger of the War With Bristol, hounds us on the Hollander: Fool coated Gown-man! sells, to fight with Hance, Dunkirk; dismantling Scotland, quarrels France: And hopes he now hath bus'ness shap'd, and Power T'out last our Lives or his, and scape the Tower; And that he yet may see, er'e he go down, His dear Clarinda circled in a Crown. By this time both the Fleets in reach dispute, And each the other Mortally salute: Draw pensive Neptune biting of his Thumbs, To think himself a Slave whoe're o'recomes. The frighted Nymphs retreating to their Rocks, Beating their Blue Breasts, tearing their Green locks. Paint Eccho slain, only th'alternate Sound From the repeating Cannon doth rebound. Opdam Sails placed on his Naval Throne, Assuming Courage greater than his own; Makes to the Duke and threatens him from far, To Nail him to his Boards like a Petar; But in the vain attempt, took fire too soon, And flies up in his Ship to catch the Moon. Monsieurs like Rockets mount aloft, and crack In thousand sparks, then dancingly fall back. Yet e're this happen'd, destiny allow'd Him his Revenge, to make his death more proud; A fatal Bullet from his side did range, And batter'd Lawson: Oh too dear Exchange! He led our Fleet that Day too short a space, But lost his Knee; since dy'd in Glory's Race: Lawson! whose Valour beyond fate did go, And still fights Opdam in the Lake below. The Duke himself, tho' Pen did not forget, Yet was not out of dangers Random set. Falmouth was there, I know not what to Act; Some say t'was to grow Duke too by contract: An untaught Bullet in its wanton Scope, Dashes him all to pieces, and his Hope. Such was his rise, such was his fall, unprais'd; A chance shot sooner took him than Chance rais'd: His shatter'd Head the fearless Duke disdains, And gave the last first proof that he had Brains. Barilet had heard it soon, and thought not good To venture more of Royal Harding's Blood: To be Immortal he was not of Age, An did e'en now the Indian Prize presage; And judg'd it safe and decent, cost what cost, To lose the Day, since his dear Brother's lost. With his whole Squadron straight away he bore, And like good Boy, promis'd to fight no more. The Dutch Auranea careless, at us Sail'd; And promis'd to do what Opdam fail'd: Smith to the Duke doth intercept her way, And cleaves t'her closer than a Remora: The Captain wonder'd, and withal disdain'd, So strongly by a thing so small, detain'd; And in a raging brav'ry to him runs, They stab their Ships with one anothers Guns: They fight so near, it seems to be on Ground, And ev'n the Bullets meeting, Bullets Wound. The Noise, the Smoak, the Fire, the Sweat, the Blood, Is not to be exprest, nor understood. Each Captain from his Quarter-deck, Commands, They wave their bright Swords glittering in their hands. All Luxury of War, all Man can do In a Sea-fight, did pass between them two: But one must conquer, whosoever fight; Smith takes the Gyant, and is made a Knight. Marlbrough that knew, and durst do more than all, Falls undistinguisht by an Iron-Ball: Dear Lord! but born under a Star ingrate! No Soul more clear, nor no more gloomy fate! Who would set up Wars Trade that means to thrive? Death picks the Valiant out, Cowards survive: VVhat the Brave merit, th'Impudent do vaunt; And none's rewarded but the Sycophant: Hence all his Life he against Fortune fenc'd, Or not well known, or not well recompenc'd: But envy not this praise t'his memory, None more prepar'd was, or less fit to Dye: Rupert did others and himself excel: Holms, Tydiman, Minns; bravely Sanson fell. VVhat others did, let none omitted, blame, I shall record, whoe'er brings in his Name: But unless after stories disagree, Nine onely came to fight, the rest to see. Now all conspire unto the Dutchmens loss; The wind, the fire, we, they themselves do cross. VVhen a sweet sleep began the Duke to drown, And with soft Diadems his Temples crown: And first he orders all the rest to watch, And They the Foe, whilst He a Nap doth catch: But lo, Brunkar by a secret instinct, Slept not, nor needed; he all day had winkt. The Duke in bed, he then first draws his steel, VVhose vertue makes the misled Compass wheel. So ere He wak'd, both Fleets were innocent: And Brunkar Member is of Parliament. And now, dear Painter, after pains, like those, 'Twere time that I and thou too do repose. But all our Navy 'scap'd so sound of Limb, That a short space serv'd to refresh and trim; And a tame Fleet of theirs doth Convoy want, Laden with both the Indies, and Levant: Paint but this one Scene more, the VVorld's our own, And Halcyon Sand???ch doth command alone: To Bergen we with confidence made haste, And th'secret spoils by hope already taste; Though Clifford in the Character appear Of Supra-Cargo to our Fleet, and their Wearing a Signet ready to clap on, And seize all for his Master Arl???gton, Ruyter whose little Squadron skim'd the Seas, And wasted our remotest Colonies, With Ships all foul, return'd upon our way; Sand???ch would not disperse, nor yet delay; And therefore like Commander grave and wise, To scape his sight and fight, shut both his Eyes; And for more state and sureness, Cutten true, The left Eye closeth, the right Mountague; And even Clifford proffer'd in his zeal, To make all safe, t'apply to both his Seal. Ulysses so, till Syrens he had past, Would by his Mates be pinion'd to the Mast. Now can our Navy view the wished Port, But there (to see the Fortune!) was a Fort: Sand???ch would not be beaten, nor yet beat; Fools only fight, the Prudent use to treat. His Cousin Moun???gue by Court-disaster, Dwindled into the wooden Horse's Master: To speak of Peace seem'd amongst all most proper, Had Talbot then treated of nought but Copper: Or what are Forts, when void of Ammunition? With friends or foes what would we more condition? Yet we three days, till the Dutch furnish'd all, Men, Powder, Money, Cannon,—treat with Wall! Then Tydiman, finding the Danes would not, Sent in six Captains bravely to be shot. And Moun???gue, though drest like any Bride, And aboard him, too, yet was reach'd and dy'd: Sad was the chance, and yet a deeper care Wrinkled his Membranes under Forehead fair. The Dutch Armado yet had th'impudence To put to Sea, to waft their Merchants thence; For as if all their Ships of Wallnut were, The more we beat them, still the more they bear: But a good Pilot, and a favouring Wind, Brings Sand???ch back, and once again did blind. Now gentle Painter, e're we leap on shore, With thy last strokes ruffle a Tempest o'er; As if in our reproach, the Wind and Seas Would undertake the Dutch, while we take ease: The Seas the spoils within our Hatches throw, The Winds both Fleets into our Mouths do blow: Strew all their Ships along the Shore by ours, As eas'ly to be gather'd up as Flow'rs: But Sand???ch fears for Merchants to mistake A Man of War, and among Flowr's a Snake. Two Indian ships pregnant with Eastern Pearl, And Diamonds, sate th'Officers and Earl: Then warning of our Fleet, he it divides Into the Ports, and so to Oxford rides. Mean while the Dutch uniting, to our shames, Ride all insulting o'er the Downes and Thames! Now treating Sand???ch seems the fittest choice For Spain, there to condole, and to rejoyce: He meets the French; but to avoid all harms, Ships to the Groyn: Embassies bear no Arms: There let him languish a long Quarantain, And ne'er to England come, till he be clean. Thus having fought, we know not why as yet; We've done we know not what, nor what we get: If to espouse the Ocean, all this pains Princes unite, and do forbid the Bains: If to discharge Phanaticks, this makes more; For all Phanaticks are, when they are poor: Or if the House of Commons to repay, Their Prize-Commissions are transferr'd away: But for triumphant Check-stones if, and shell For Dutchess Closet, 't hath succeeded well. If to make Parliaments as odious pass, Or to reserve a standing force, alas! Or if, as just, ORANGE to re-instate, Instead of that, he is regenerate: And with four Millions vainly giv'n as spent, And with five Millions more of detriment, Our sum amounts yet onely to have won A bastard Orange for Pimp Arl????ton. Now may Historians argue con and pro: Denham says thus; though always Waller so: And he good Man, in his long sheet and staff, This pennance did for Cromwels Epitaph: And his next Theam must be o'th Dukes Mistress, Advice to draw Madam l' Edificatress. Henceforth, O Gemini! two Dukes Command, Castor and Pollux, Aumarle and Cumberland. Since in one ship, it had been fit they'd went In Petty's Double-Kneel'd Experiment. To the KING. By Sir JOHN DENHAM. Imperial Prince! King of the Seas and Isles! Dear Object of our Joy, and Heaven's smiles! What bootes it that thy Light doth gild our days, And we lie basking in thy milder Rays, While swarms of Insects, from thy warmth begun? Our Land devour, and intercept our Sun? Thou, like Joves Minos rul'st a greater Creet; And for its hundred Cities, Count'st thy Fleet. Why wilt thou that state-Dædalus allow, Who builds the Butt, a Lab'rinth and a Cow? If thou art Minos, be a Judge severe, And in's own Maze confine the Engineer. O may our Sun, since he too nigh presumes, Melt the soft Wax wherewith he imps his plumes And may he falling leave his hated Name Unto these Seas his War hath set on flame! From that Enchanter having clear'd thine Eyes, Thy native sight will pierce within the Skies, And view those Kingdoms calm with Joy and Light, Where's Universal Triumph, but no Fight. Since both from Heav'n thy Race and Pow'r descend, Rule by its pattern there to reascend Let Justice onely awe, and Battel cease: Kings are but Cards in War; they're Gods in Peace. Directions to a Painter. By Sir John Denham. Sand???ch in Spain now, and the Duke in love. Let's with new Gen'rals a New Painter prove: Lylly's a Dutchman, danger's in his Art, His Pencils may Intelligence impart. Thou Gibson, that amongst thy Navy small Of Muscle-shells commandest Admiral, Thy self so slender, that thou shew'st no more Than Barnacle new hatch'd of them before: Come mix thy Water-colours, and express, Drawing in little, what we yet do less. First paint me George and Rupert ratling far Both in one Box, like the two Dice of War? And let the terror of their linked Name, Fly through the Air, like Chain-shot, tearing Fame: Jove in one Cloud did scarcely ever wrap Lightning so fierce, but never such a clap. United Gen'rals sure are th'onely spell, Wherewith United Provinces to quell: Alas, even they, though shell'd in treble Oak, Will prove an Addle Egge, with double Yolk. And therefore next uncouple either Hound, And loo them at two Hares e're one be found: Rupert to Beaufort; halloo! ah, there Rupert Like the phantastick hunting of St. Hubert, When he with Airy Hounds, and Horn of Air, Pursues by Fountain bleau the witchy Hare. Deep providence of State! that could so soon Fight Beaufort here, e're he had quit Thouloon. So have I seen, e're Human Quarrels rise, Fore-boding Meteors combate in the Skies. But let the Prince to fight with Rumour go, The Gen'rals meet a more substantial Foe: Ruyter he spies, and full of youthful heat, Though half their number, thinks the odds too great: The Fowler watching so his watry spot, And more the Fowl, hopes for the better shot. Though such a Limb was from his Navy torn, He found no weakness yet, like Sampson shorn; But swoln with sence of former Glory won, Thought Monk must be by Albemarle out done: Little he knew with the same Arm and Sword, How far the Gentleman out-cuts the Lord. Ruyter, inferiour unto none for Heart, Superiour now in number and in Art; Ask'd if he thought, as once our Rebel-Nation, To conquer Theirs too, with a Declaration? And threatens, though he now so proudly Sail, He shall tread back his Iter Boreale: This said, he the short Period, e're it ends, With Iron-words from Brazen-Mouths extends: Monk yet prevents him, e're the Navies meet, And charges in himself alone a Fleet; And with so quick and frequent motion Wound His murthering sides about, the Ship seem'd round; And the Exchanges of his Circling Tire, Like whirling Hoops, shew'd of triumphant Fire. Single he doth at their whole Navy aim, And shoots them through a Porcupine of Flame. In noise so regular his Cannons met, You'd think that Thunder was to Musick set: Ah! had the rest but kept a time as true What Age could such a Martial Consort shew! The listning Air unto the distant Shore, Through secret Pipes conveys the tuned Roar; Till as the Eccho's, vanishing, abate, Men feel a dead sound like the pulse of State. If Fate expire, let Monk her place supply, His Guns determine who shall live or dye. But Victory doth always hate a Rant; Valour's her Brave, but Skill is her Gallant: Ruyter no less with vertuous Envy burns, And prodigies for Miracles returns: Yet he observ'd how still his Iron Balls Recoyl'd in vain against our Oaken Walls. How the hard Pellets fell away as dead, By our inchanted Timber fillipped. Leave then, said he, th'invulnerable Keel, We'll find they're feeble, like Achilles Heel: He quickly taught, pours in continual Clouds Of chain'd Dilemma's through our sinew'd Shrouds. Forrests of Masts fall with their rude embrace, Our stiff Sails masht, and netted into Lace; Till our whole Navy lay their wanton Mark, Nor any Ship could Sail but as the Ark, Shot in the Wing, so at the Powder's call, The disappointed Bird doth flutt'ring fall. Yet Monk disabl'd, still such courage shews, That none into his mortal gripe dare close: So an old Bustard, maim'd yet loth to yeild, Duels the Fowler in New-Market Field. But since he found it was in vain to fight, He imps his Plumes the best he can to flight: This, Painter, were a noble Task to tell, What indignation his great Breast did swell! Not vertuous Man unworthily abus'd, Not constant Lover without cause refus'd, Not Honest Merchant broke, nor skilful Player Hist off the Stage, nor Sinners in despair; Not Parents mockt, not Favourites disgrac'd, Not Rump by Monk, or Oliver displac'd, Not Kings depos'd, nor Prelates ere they die, Feel half the Rage of Gen'rals when they Fly. Ah rather than transmit th'story to Fame, Draw Curtains, Gentle artist, o'er the shame: Cashier the mem'ry of Dutell, rais'd up To tast, instead of Death, his Highness Cup; And if the thing were true, yet paint it not, How Bartlet, as he long deserv'd, was shot; Though others, that survey'd the Corps so clear, Said he was only petrify'd for fear: If so, th'hard Statue Mummy'd without Gum, Might the Dutch Balm have spar'd, &amp; English Tomb. Yet if thou wilt paint MINNS turn'd all to Soul, And the great HARMAN charkt almost to Coal; And JORDAIN old worthy thy Pencil's pain, Who all the while held up the Ducal Train: But in a dark Cloud cover Askew, when He quit the Prince to embarque in Lovestein; And Wounded Ships, which we Immortal boast, Now first led Captive to an hostile Coast. But most with story of his Hand and Thumb, Conceal (as Honour would) his Grace's Bum, When the rude Bullet a large Collop tore Out of that Buttock never turn'd before: Fortune (it seems) would give him by that Lash, Gentle correction for his fight so Rash. But should the Rump perceive't, they'd say that Mars Had now reveng'd them upon Aumarle's Arse. The long disaster better o'er to vail, Paint only Jonas three days in the Whale; For no less time did conqu'ring Ruyter chaw Our flying Gen'ral in his Spungy Jaw. Then draw the Youthful Perseus all in haste, From a Sea-Beast to free the Virgin chaste; But neither Riding Pegasus for speed, Nor with the Gorgon Sheilded at his need: So Rupert the Sea Dragon did invade, But to save George himself and not the Maid; And though arriving late, he quickly mist Ev'n Sails to fly, unable to resist. Not Greenland Seamen that survive the fright Of the Cold Chaos, and half eternal Night, So gladly the returning Sun adore, Or run to spy the next Years Fleet from Shore, Hoping yet once within the Oyly side Of the fat Whale, again their Spears to hide, As our glad Fleet, with universal shout, Salute the Prince, and wish the second bout. Nor Winds, long Pris'ners in Earths hollow Vault, The fallow Seas so eagerly assault; As fiery Rupert, with revengeful Joy, Doth on the Dutch his hungry Courage cloy; But soon unrigg'd, lay like an useless Board; (As Wounded in the Wrist, Men drop their Sword.) When a propitious Cloud between us stept, And in our Aid did Ruyter intercept. Old Homer yet did never introduce, To save his Heroes, Mists of better use. Worship the Sun, who dwell where he doth rise; This Mist doth more deserve our Sacrifice. Now joyful Fires, and the exaulted Bell, And Court-Gazetts, our empty Triumphs tell! Alas! the time draws near, when overturn'd, The lying Bells shall through the Tongues be burn'd; Paper shall want to print that Lye of State, And our false Fires, true Fires shall expiate. Stay Painter here a while, and I will stay; Nor vex the future Times with my survey: Seest not the Monky Dutchess all undrest? Paint thou but her, and she will Paint the rest. This sad Tale found her in her outward Room, Nailing up Hangings not of Persian Loom: Like chaste Penelope that ne'er did rome, But made all fine against her GEORGE came home. Upon a Ladder, in her Coats much shorter, She stood, with Groom and Coach-man for Supporter; And careless what they saw, or what they thought, With Honi Pense full honestly she wrought: One Tenter drove, to lose no time nor place, At once the Ladder thy remove, and Grace. Whilst thus they her translate from North to East, In posture just of a four footed Beast; She heard the news: But alter'd yet no more, Than that which was behind, she turn'd before; Nor would come down, but with an Handkercher, With Pocket foul did to her Neck prefer: She shed no Tears, for she was too Viraginous, But only snuffling her Trunk Cartilaginous, From scaling Ladder she began a Story, Worthy to be had in Memento Mori; Arraigning past, and present, and futuri, With a Prophetick, if not Friendly Fury: Her Hair began to creep, her Belly sound, Her Eyes to sparkle, and her Udder bound; Half Witch, half Prophet; thus the Alb???arle, Like Presbyterian Sybil, 'gan to Snarl: Traytors both to my Lord, and to the King! Nay now it is beyond all Suffering! One valiant Man by Land, and he must be Commanded out to stop their leaks at Sea: Yet send him Rupert, as an helper meet; First the Commands dividing, then the Fleet: One may if they be beat, or both be hit, Or if they overcome, yet Honours split: But reck'ning GEORGE already knock'd i'th' head, They cut him out like Beef, e're he be dead: Each for a Quarter hopes; the first doth skip, But shall fall short though, at the Gen'ral Ship: Next they for Master of the Horse agree; A third the Cock-pit begs; not any Me: But they shall know, Ay! marry shall they do, That who the Cock-pit hath, shall have Me too. I told George first, as Calamy told me, If the King brought these o're, how it would be: Men that there pick his Pocket to his Face, And sell Intelligence to buy a place. That their Religion's pawn'd for Cloths, nor care, 'Tis run so long now, to redeem't, nor dare. O what egregious Loyalty to cheat! O what Fidelity it was to Eat! Whilst Langdales, Hoptons, Glenhams starv'd abroad, And here true Roy'lists sink beneath their load. Men that did there affront, defame, betray The King, and so do here; now who but they! What! say I Men! Nay, rather Monsters; Men Only in Bed, nor to my Knowledge then. See how they home return'd in Revel Rout, With the small manners that they first went out: Not better grown, nor wiser all the while, Renew the causes of their first Exile: As if, to shew the Fool what 'tis I mean, I chose a foul Smock, when I might have clean. First they for fear disband the Army tame, And leave good George a Gen'ral's empty Name: Then Bishops must revive, and all unfix With discontents, to content Twenty Six: The Lords House drains the Houses of the Lord, For Bishops Voices silencing the Word: O Barthol'mew! Saint of their Kalendar! What's worse, th'Ejection or the Massacre? Then Culpepper, Glouster, and the Princess dy'd; Nothing can live that interrupts an H?de. O more than humane GLOSTER! Fate did shew Thee but to Earth, and back again withdrew. Then the Fat Scrivener doth begin to think 'Twas time to mix the Royal Blood with Ink. Barkley that swore as oft as he had Toes, Doth kneeling now her Chastity depose; Just as the first French Card'nal could restore Maiden-head to his Widdow, Niece, and Whore. For Portion, if she could prove light, when weigh'd, Four Millions shall within three years be paid; To raise it, we must have a Naval War, As if 'twere nothing but Tara-Tan-Tar: Abroad all Princes disobliging first, At home all Parties but the very worst. To tell of Ireland, Scotland, Dunkirk, 's sad; Or the King's Marr'age: but he thinks I'm mad: And sweeter Creature never saw the Sun, If we the King wish Monk, or Queen a Nun. But a Dutch War shall all these Rumours still, Bleed out these Humours, and our Purses fill; Yet after four days Fight, they clearly saw 'Twas too much danger for a Sun-in-Law: Hire him to leave, for six score Thousand pound: So with the King's Drums Men for sleep compound. But modest Sand???ch thought it might agree With the State-Prudence, to do less than He; And to excuse their timerousness and sloth, They found how George might now be less than both. First Smith must for Leghorn, with force enough To venture back again, but not go through: Beaufort is there, and to their dazling Eyes The distance more the Object magnifies; Yet this thy gain, that Smith his time should lose, And for my Duke too, cannot interpose. But fearing that our Navy, George to break, Might yet not be sufficiently weak; The Secretary, that had never yet Intelligence, but from his own Gazette, Discovers a great secret, fit to sell, And pays himself for't, e're he would it tell; Beaufort is in the Channel; Hixy here! Doxy Thoulon! Beaufort is ev'ry where. Herewith assembling the supreme Divan, Where enters none but Devil, NED, and NAN; And upon this pretence they straight design'd The Fleet to sep'rate, and the World to blind: Monk to the Dutch, and Rupert (here the Wench Could not but smile) is destin'd to the French. To write the Order, Bristol Clerk is chose; One slit in's Pen, the other in his Nose; For he first brought the News, it is his place; He'll see the Fleet divided like his Face, And through the cranny in his grisly part, To the Dutch Chink Intelligence impart. The Plot succeeds: The Dutch in haste prepar'd, And poor Peel Garlick George's Arse they shar'd; And then presuming of his certain wrack, To help him late, they send for Rupert back. Officious Will seem'd fittest, as afraid Lest George should look too far into his trade. At the first draught they pause with Statesmens care, They write it full, then copy it as fair; And then compare them, when at last it's sign'd, Will soon his Purse-strings, but no Seal could find. At night he sends it by the common Post, To save the King of an Express the cost. Lord, what adoe to pack one Letter hence! Some Patents pass with less circumference. Well George, in spite of them thou safe dost ride, Lessen'd I hope in nought but thy backside; For as to Reputation, this Retreat Of thine exceeds their Victories so great: Nor shalt thou stir from thence, by my consent, Till thou hast made the Dutch and Them repent. 'Tis true, I want so long the Nuptial Gift, But as I oft have done, I'll make a Shift; Nor will I with vain pomp accost the Shore, To try thy Valour at the Buoy i'th' Nore, Fall to thy work there, George, as I do here; Cherish the Valiant up, Cowards cashier: See that the Men have Pay, and Beef, and Beer, Find out the Cheats of the four Millioneer. Out of the very Beer, they sell the Malt; Powder of Powder, from powder'd Beef the Salt. Put thy hand to the Tub, instead of Oxe, They Victual with French Pork that hath the Pox. Never such Cotqueans by small Arts to wring, Ne'er such ill Huswives in the managing! Pursers at Sea know fewer Cheats than they, Marriners on Shore less madly spend their Pay. See that thou hast new Sails thy self, and spoil All their Sea-market, and their Cable-coyl. Look that Good Chaplains on each Ship do wait, Nor the Sea-Diocess be impropriate: Look to the sick and wounded Pris'ners; all Is prize; they rob even the Hospital, Recover back the Prizes too; in vain We fight, if all be taken that is ta'en, Now by our Coast the Dutchmen, like a Flight Of feeding Ducks, ev'ning and morning light; How our Land-Hectors tremble, void of sense, As if they came straight to transport them hence: Some Sheep are stol'n; the Kingdom's all array'd, And ev'n Presbyters now called out for aid. They wish ev'n George divided to command, One half of Him at Sea, th'other on Land. What's that I see! Ah 'tis my George agen! It seems they in sev'n weeks have Rigg'd him then. The curious Heav'ns with Lightning him surrounds, To view him, and his Name in Thunder sounds. But with the same swift goes, Their Navy's near: So e're we hunt, the Keeper shoots the Deer. Stay Heav'n a while, and thou shalt see him sail, And George too, he can thunder, lighten, hail. Happy the time that I e'er wedded George. The Sword of England, and the Holland Scourge. Avaunt Rotterdam-Dog, Ruyter avaunt, Thou Water-Rat, thou Sharke, thou Cormorant. I'll teach thee to shoot Scissers: I'le repair Each Rope thou losest George, out of this Hair. 'Tis strong and course enough; I'll hem this shift, E're thou shalt lack a Sail, and lie a drift: Bring home the old ones; I again will Sew, And darn them up, to be as good as new. What, twice disabled! Never such a thing! Now Soveraign help him that brought in the King. Guard thy Posteriors, George, e're all be gone, Though Jury-Masts, thou'st Jury-Buttocks none. Courage! How bravely (whet with this disgrace) He turns, and Bullets spits in Ruyter's face! They fly, they fly their Fleet doth now divide, But they discard their Trump: our Trump is Hide. Where are you now, De Ruyter, with your Bears? See where your Merchants burn about your Ears. Fire out the Wasps, George from the hollow Trees, Cramm'd with the Honey of our English Bees. Ah now they're paid for Guinney: e're they steer To the Gold Coast, they find it hotter here. Turn all your Ships to Stoves e're you set forth, To warm your Traffick in the frozen North. Ah Sandwich! had thy conduct been the same, Bergen had seen a less but richer Flame; Nor Ruyter liv'd new Battel to repeat, And oftner beaten be, than we can beat. Scarce had George leisure, after all his pain, To tie his Breeches; Ruyter's out again: Thrice in one Year! Why sure this Man is wood: Beat him like Stock-fish, or he'll ne're be good. I see them both again prepare to try; The first shot through each other with the Eye. Then—But the Ruling Providence that must With humane Projects play, as Wind with Dust, Raises a storm. So Constables a fray Knock down; and send them both well cuff'd away. Plant now New England Firs in English Oak, Build your Ships Ribs proof to the Cannon-stroke: To get the Fleet to Sea, exhaust the Land; Let longing Princes pine for the Command: Strong March-panes! Wafer lights! so thin a puff Of angry Air can ruin all that Huff: So Champions having shar'd the Lists and Sun, The Judge throws down's Award, and they have done. For shame come home George, 'tis for thee too much To fight at once with Heaven and the Dutch. Woe's me! what see I next! alas! the fate I see of England, and its utmost date. Those Flames of theirs at which we fondly smile, Kindle like Torches our Sepulchral Pile. War, Fire, and Plague against us all conspire; We the War, God the Plague, who rais'd the Fire? See how Men all like Ghosts, while London burns, Wander, and each over his Ashes mourns! Curs'd be the Man that first begat this War; In an ill hour, under a Blazing Star. For Others sport two Nations fight a Prize; Between them both, Religion wounded dies. So of first Troy, the angry Gods unpaid, Raz'd the Foundations which themselves had laid. Welcome, though late, dear George: here hadst thou bin, We'd scap'd: (let Rupert bring the Navy in.) Thou still must help them out, when in the mire; Gen'ral at Land, at Plague, at Sea, at Fire. Now thou art gone, see Beaufort dares approach, And our Fleets Angling, as to catch a Roach. Gibson farewel, till next we put to Sea: Truth is, thou'st drawn her in Effigie. To the KING. By Sir JOHN DENHAM. Great Prince! and so much Greater as more VVise; Sweet as our Life, and dearer than our Eyes, VVhat Servants will conceal, and Councels spare To tell, the Painter and the Poet dare. And the assistance of an Heavenly Muse And Pencil represent the Crimes abstruse. Here needs no Fleet, no Sword, no Forreign Foe; Only let Vice be damn'd, and Justice flow. Shake but, like Jove, thy Locks divine, and frown, Thy Scepter will suffice to guard thy Crown. Hark to Cassandra's Song, e're fate destroy By thine lowd Navy's wooden Horse, thy Troy. As our Apollo, from the Tumults wave, And Gentle Calms, though but in Oars, will save, So Philomel her sad Embroidery strung, And vocal Silks tun'd with her Needles Tongue. The Pictures dumb in Colours loud reveal'd The Tragedies at Court so long conceal'd; But when restor'd to voice inclos'd with wings To Woods and Groves what once the Painter sings. Direstions to a Painter. The attribution of this poem is questionable. By Sir John Denham. Draw England ruin'd by what was giv'n before, Then draw the Commons slow in giving more: Too late grown wiser, they their treasure see Consum'd by fraud, or lost by treachery; And vainly now would some account receive Of those vast Sums which they so idly gave, And trusted to the management of such As Dunkirk, sold, to make War with the Dutch; Dunkirk, design'd once to a Nobler Use, Than to erect a petty Lawyers House. But what account could they from those expect, Who to grow rich themselves, the State neglect; Men who in England have no other Lot, Than what they by betraying it have got; Who can pretend to nothing but Disgrace, Where either Birth or Merit find a place. Plague, Fire and War, have been the Nations Curse, But to have these our Rulers, is a worse: Yet draw these Causers of the Kingdoms Woe, Still urging dangers from our growing Foe, Asking new Aid for War with the same face, As if, when giv'n, they meant not to make Peace. Mean while they cheat the Publick with such haste, They will have nothing that may ease it, past. The Law 'gainst Irish Cattel they condemn, As shewing distrust o'th' King; that is, of them. Yet they must now swallow this bitter Pill, Or Money want, which were the greater ill. And then the King to Westminster is brought, Imperfectly to speak the Chanc'lors thought; In which, as if no Age could parallel A Prince and Council that had rul'd so well, He tells the Parliament He cannot brook What ere in them like Jealousie doth look: Adds, That no Grievances the Nation load, While we're undone at home, despis'd abroad. Thus past the Irish, with the Money-Bill, The first not half so good, as th'other ill. With these new Millions might we not expect Our Foes to vanquish, or our selves protect; If not to beat them off usurped Seas, At least to force an honourable Peace: But though the angry fate, or folly rather, Of our perverted State, allow us neither; Could we hope less than to defend our Shores, Than guard our Harbours, Forts, our Ships and Stores? We hop'd in vain: Of these, remaining are, Not what we sav'd, but what the Dutch did spare. Such was our Rulers generous stratagem; A policy worthy of none but them. After two Millions more laid on the Nation, The Parliament grows ripe for Prorogation: They rise, and now a Treaty is confest, 'Gainst which before these State-Cheats did protest: A Treaty which too well makes it appear, Theirs, not the Kingdom's Int'rest, is their care. Statesmen of old, thought Arms the way to Peace; Ours scorn such thread-bare Policies as these: All that was given for the State's defence, They think too little for their own expence: Or if from that they any thing can spare, It is to buy Peace, not maintain a War: For which great work Embassadors must go With bare submissions to our arming foe: Thus leaving a defenceless State behind, Vast Fleets preparing by the Belgians find; Against whose fury what can us defend? Whilst our great Polititians here depend Upon the Dutch good Nature: For when Peace (Say they) is making, Acts of War must cease. Thus were we by the name of Truce betray'd, Though by the Dutch nothing like it was made. Here, Painter, let thine Art describe a Story Shaming our warlike Islands ancient Glory: A Scene wich never on our Seas appear'd, Since our first ships where on the Ocean steer'd; Make the Dutch Fleet, while we supinely sleep, Without Opposers, Masters of the Deep: Make them securely the Thames mouth invade, At once depriving us of that and Trade: Draw Thunder from their floating Castles, sent Against our Forts, weak as our Government: Draw Woollige, Deptford, London, and the Tower, Meanly abandon'd, to a foreign Power. Yet turn their first attempt another way, And let their Cannons upon Sheerness play; Which soon destroy'd, their lofty Vessels ride Big with the hope of the approaching Tide: Make them more help from our Remisness find, Than from the Tide, or from the Eastern wind. Their Canvas swelling with a prosp'rous gale, Swift as our fears make them to Chattam sail: Through our weak Chain their Fireships break their way, And our Great Ships (unman'd) become their prey: Then draw the fruit of our ill-manag'd cost, At once our Honour and our Safety lost: Bury those Bulwarks of our Isle in smoak, While their thick flames the neighb'ring Country choak, The Charles escapes the raging Element, To be with trumph into Holland sent; Where the glad People to the shore resort, To see their Terror now become their Sport. But Painter, fill not up thy Piece before Thou paint'st Confusion on our troubled shore: Instruct then thy bold Pencil to relate The saddest Marks of an Ill govern'd State. Draw th'injur'd Seamen deaf to all command, While some with Horror and Amazement stand: Others will know no other Enemy but they Who have unjustly robb'd them of their Pay: Boldly refusing to oppose a Fire; To kindle which, our Errors did Conspire: Some (though but few) perswaded to obey, Useless for want of Ammunition stay: The Forts design'd to guard our Ships of War, Void both of Powder and of Bullets are: And what past Reigns in Peace did ne're omit, The present (whilst invaded) doth forget. Surpassing Chattam, make Whitehall appear, If not in danger, yet at least in fear. Make our dejection (if thou canst) seem more Than our Pride, Sloth, and Ign'rance did before: The King, of danger now shews far more fear, Than he did ever to prevent it, care; Yet to the City doth himself convey, Bravely to shew he was not run away: Whilst the Black Prince, and our Fifth Harry's Wars, Are only acted on our Theaters: Our States-Men finding no expedient, (If fear of danger) but a Parliament, Twice would a void, by clapping up a Peace; The Cure's to them as bad as the Disease: But Painter, end not, till it does appear Which most, the Dutch or Parliament they fear. As Nero once, with Harp in Hand, survey'd His flaming Rome; and as that burnt, he plaid: So our great Prince, when the Dutch Fleet arriv'd, Saw his Ships burne; and as they burnt, he? Directions to a Painter. by Sir John Denham. The attribution of this poem is questionable. Painter, Where was't thy former Work did cease? Oh, 'twas at Parliament, and the brave Peace Now for a Cornucopia: Peace, all know Brings Plenty with it; wish it be not Woe. Draw Coats of Pageantry, and Proclamations Of Peace, concluded with one, two, three Nations. Canst thou not on the Change make Merchants grin Like outward smiles, whiles vexing thoughts within? Thou art no Artist, if thou canst not feign, And counterfeit the counterfeit disdain. Draw a brave Standard, rufling at a rate Much other than it did for Chathams fate. The Tow'r-Guns too, thund'ring their Joys, that they Have scap'd, the danger of b'ing ta'en away: These, as now mann'd, for triumph are, not fight; As painted fire for show, not heat or light. Amongst the Roar of these, and the mad shout Of a poor nothing understanding Rout, That think the On-and-Off-Peace now is true, Thou might'st draw Mourners for Black Bartholmew: Mourners in Sion! Oh 'tis not to be Discover'd! draw a Curtain curteously To hide them. Now proceed to draw at night A Bonfire here and there; but none too bright, Nor lasting: for 'twas Brushwood, as they say, Which they that hop'd for Coals now flung away. But stay, I had forgot my Mother: Draw The Church of England 'mongst the Opera, To play their part too; or the Dutch will say In War and Peace they've born the Bells away. At this end then, two or three Steeples ringing, At th'other end, draw Quires, Te Deum singing; Between them leave a space for Tears: Remember That 'tis not long to th'Second of September. Now if thou skill'st prospective Landskip, draw At distance, what perhaps thine Eyes ne'er saw; Polyroon, Spicy Islands, Kits, or Guinney; Syrrenam, Nova Scotia, or Virginia: No, no; I mean not these; pray hold your laughter; These things are far off, not worth looking after: Give not a hint of these: Draw Highland, Lowland, Mountains and Flats: Draw Scotland first, then Holland. See, canst thou ken the Scots Frowns? Then draw those That something had to get, but naught to lose. Canst thou through Fogs discern the Dutchmen drink? But Skippers, lately Capers, stamp to think Their catching craft is over: some have ta'en, To eke their War, a Warrant from the Dane. But passing these, their Statesmen view a while, In ev'ry graver Countenance a Smile: Copy the piece there done, wherein you'll see One laughing out, I told you how 'twould be! Draw next a pompous Interchange of Seals; But curs'd be he that Articles reveals Before he knows them: Now for this take light From him that did describe Sir Edward's fight: You may perhaps the truth on't doubt; What tho? You'll have it then Cum Privilegio. Then draw our Lords Commissioners advance, Not homewards, but for Flanders, or for France; There to Parlier a while, until they see How things in Parliament resented be. So much for Peace. Now for a Parliament: A petty Sessions draw: With what content, Guess by their Countenance who came up post, And quickly saw they had their Labour lost: Like the small Merchants when they Bargains sell; Come hither Jack: What say? Come kiss: Farewel: But 'twas abortive, born before it's Day; No wonder then it dy'd so soon away. Yet breath'd it once, and that with such a force, It blasted Thirty Thousand Foot and Horse. As once Prometheus Man did sneez so hard, As routed all that new rais'd standing Guard Of Teeth, to keep the Tongue in order: So Down fall our new Gallants without a Foe. But if this little one could do so much, What will the next? Give a Prophetick touch. If thou know how; if not, leave a great space, For great things to be pourtray'd in their place. Now draw the shadow of a Parliament, As if to scare the upper World 'twere sent: Cross your selves, Gentlemen, for shades will fright, Especially if't be an English Sprite: Vermilion this mans guilt, cerule his fears; Sink th'others Eyes deep in his Head with cares: Another thought some on Accounts to see How his Disbursements with Receipts agree. Peep into Coaches, see Perriwigs neglected, Cross'd Arms and Legs of such as are suspected, Or do suspect what's coming, and foresee Themselves must share in this Polutrophy. Painter, hast travell'd? Dist thou e'er see Rome? That fam'd piece there, Angelo's Day of doom? Horror and Anguish of Descenders there, May teach thee how to paint Descenders here. Canst thou describe the empty shifts are made, Like that which Dealers call, Forcing of Trade? Some shift their Crimes, some Places; and among The rest, some will their Countries too, ere long. Draw in a corner, Gamesters, shuffling, cutting, Their little crafts, no wit, together putting: How to pack Knaves 'mongst Kings and Queens, to make A saving Game, whilst Heads are at the stake. But cross their Cards, until it be confest, Of all the play, fair dealing is the best. Draw a Veil of Displeasure, one to Hide, And some prepared to strike a blow on's side. Let him that built high, now creep low to shelter, When Potentates must tumble Helter Skelter. The Purse, Seal, Mace, are gone, as it was fit; Such Marks as these could not chuse but be hit. The Purse, Seal, Mace, are gone; Bartholomew-day, Of all the days i'th' year, they're ta'en away. The Purse, Seal, Mace, are gone; but to another, Mitre; I wish not so, though to my Brother: I care not for translation to a See, Unless they would translate to Italy. Now draw a Sail playing before the Wind, From the North-West; that which it leaves behind, Curses or out-cries, mind them not, tell when They do appear Realities, and then Spare not to Paint them in their Colours, though Crimes of a Viceroy: Deputies have so Been serv'd e're now: But if the Man prove true. Let him with Pharohs Butler have his due, Make the same Wind blow strong against the Shore Of France, to hinder some from coming o're. And rather draw the Golden Vessel burning, Even there, than hither with her Fraight returning. 'Tis true, the noble Treasurer is gone: Wise, Faithful, Loyal; some say th'only one: Yet I will hope we've Pilots left behind Can steer our Vessel without Southern Wind. Women have grosly snar'd the wisest Prince That ever was before, or hath been since: And Granham Athaliah in that Nation, Was a great hinderer of Reformation. Paint in a new Peice painted Jezabel; Giv't to adorn the Dining Room of Hell. Hang by her others of the Gang; for more Deserve a place with Rosamond, Jane Shore, &amp;c, Stay Painter; now look here's below a space, I'th' bottom of all this, what shall we place? Shall it be Pope, or Turk, or Prince, or Nun? Let the resolve write Nescio. So have done. Expose thy Peace now to the World to see: Perhaps they'l say of It, of Thee, of Me, Poems and Paints can speak sometimes bold Truths, Poets and Painters are Licentious Youths. Quæ sequuntur, in limine Thalami Regii, à nescio quo nebulone scripta, reperibantur. Bella fugis, Bellas sequeris, Belloque repugnas Et Bèllatori, sunt tibi Bella Thori Imbelles Imbellis amas, Audaxque videris Mars ad opus Veneris, Martis ad Arma Venus. The last Instructions to a Painter, About the Dutch Wars 1667. By A. Marvell, Esq; After two sittings now our Lady-State T'end her Picture doth the third time wait; But e're thou fall'st to work, first Painter see, If't be'nt too slight grown, or too hard for thee. Canst thou paint without Colours, then 'tis right? For so we too without a Fleet can fight. Or canst thou daub a Sign-post, and that ill? 'Twill suit our great Debauch, and little Skill. Or hast thou markt how Antique Masters Limn, The Aly roof with Snuff of Candledimme, Sketching in shady Smoak, prodigious tools? 'Twill serve this race of Drunkards, Pimps and Fools, But if to match our crimes thy skill presumes, As th'Indian draw our luxury in Plumes. Or if to score out our Compendious fame, With Hook then thro your Microscope take aim. Where like the new Comptroller all Men laugh, To see a tall Louse brandish a white Staff. Else shalt thou oft thy guiltless Pencil curse, Stamp on thy Palate, nor perhaps the worse. The Painter so long having vext his Cloth, Of his Hounds mouth to feign the raging Froth, His desperate Pencil at the work did dart; His anger reacht that rage which past his Art. Chance finisht that, which Art could but begin, And he sat Smiling how his Dog did grin. So may'st thou perfect by a lucky Blow, What all thy softest touches cannot do. Paint then St Albans full of Soop and Gold, The new Courts pattern, Stallion of the old. Him neither Wit nor Courage did exalt, But Fortune chose him for her pleasure's Salt. Paint him with Dray-mans Shoulders, Butchers meine, Member'd like Mule, with Elephantine Chin. Well, he the Title of St. Albans bore; For never Bacon studied Nature more: But age allaying now that Youthful heat, Fits him in France to play at Cards and cheat. Draw now Commission, lest the Court should lye, And disavowing Treaty ask supply; He needs no Seal, but to St. James's lease, Whose Breeches were the Instruments of Peace. Who if the French dispute his power, from thence Can strait produce them a Plenipotence. Nor fears he the Most Christian should trapan Two Saints at once, St German, St. Alban; But thought the Golden age was now restor'd, When Men and Women took each others word. Paint then again her Highness to the Life, Philosopher beyond Newcastles Wife: She naked can Archimedes self put down For an experiment upon the Crown. She perfected that Engine oft essay'd, How after Child-birth to renew a Maid; And found how Royal Heirs might be matur'd In fewer months than Mothers once endur'd. Hence Crowder made the rare Inventress free Of's Highnesses Royal Society. (Happiest of Women if she were but able To make her glassen Duke once malleable.) Paint her with Oyster lip, and Breath of fame, Wide Mouth, that Sparagus may well proclaim; With Chancellors Belly, and so large a Rump, There (not behind the Coach) her Pages jump: Express her Studying now if China Clay Can without breaking venom'd Juice convey. Or how a mortal Poison she may draw Out of the Cordial Meal of the Cacoe. Witness ye Stars of Night, and thou the pale Moon, that o'ercome with the sick Steam didst fail. Ye neighbouring Elms that your green Leaves did shed, And Fauns that from the Womb abortive fled. Not unprovok'd she tries forbidden Arts, But in her soft Breast Loves hid Cancer smarts, While she revolves at once Sydney's disgrace, And her self scorn'd, for emulous Denhams Face, And nightly hears the hated Guards away Galloping with the Duke to other Prey. Paint Castlemain in colours that will hold Her, not her Picture, for she now grows old. She thro' her Lackey's, Drawers, as he ran, Discern'd Loves cause, and a new flame began. Her wonted joys thenceforth, and Court she shuns, And still within her mind the Footman runs. His brazen Calves, his brawny Thighs (the Face She slights) his Feet shap't for a smoother race. Poring within her Glass she re-adjusts Her locks, and oft try'd Beauty now distrusts; Fears lest he scorn'd a Woman once assay'd, And now first wisht she e're had been a Maid. Great Love! how dost thou Triumph, and how reign, That to a Groom could'st humble her disdain! Stript to her Skin, see how she stooping stands, Nor scorns to rub him down with those fair Hands, And washing (lest the scent her crime disclose) His sweaty Hoofs, tickles him 'twixt the Toes. But envious Fame too soon began to note More Gold in's Fob, more Lace upon his Coat; And he unwary, and of Tongue too fleet, No longer could conceal his Fortune sweet. Justly the Rogue was whipt in Porters Den, And Jermin streight has leave to come again. Ah Painter! now could Alexander live, And this Campaspe thee Apelles give. Draw next a pair of Tablets opening, then The House of Commons clattering like the Men. Describe the Court and Country both set right On opposite points, the Black against the White. Those having lost the Nation at Tick-Tack, These now adventuring how to win it back. The Dice betwixt them must the fate divide, (As Chance does still in multitudes decide) But here the Court doth its advantage know, For the cheat Turner for them both must throw; As some from Boxes, he so from the Chair Can strike the Dye, and still with them go share. Here Painter rest a little, and survey With what small Arts the Publick Game they play: For so too, Rubens with affairs of State His labouring Pencil oft would recreate. The close Cabal markt how the Navy eats, And thought all lost that goes not to the Cheats. So therefore secretly for Peace decrees, Yet as for War the Parliament would squeeze; And fix to the revenue such a summe Should Goodrick silence, and strike Paston Dumb: Should pay land Armies, should dissolve the vain Commons, and ever such a Court maintain, Hides avarice, Bennets luxury should suffice: And what can these defray but the Excise? Excise a Monster, worse than e're before, Frighted the Midwife, and the Mother tore: A thousand Hands she has, and thousand Eyes, Breaks into Shops, and into Cellars pries. With hundred rows of Teeth the Shark exceeds, And on all Trades like Casawar she feeds; Chops of the piece wheres' e're she close the Jaw, Else swallows all down her indented Maw. She stalks all day in Streets conceal'd from sight, And flyes like Batts with Leathern Wings by Night; She wastes the Country, and on Cities preys: Her of a Female Harpy in Dog-Days Black Birch, of all the Earth-born Race most hot, And most rapacious like himself, begot; And of his Brat enamour'd, as 't increast, Bugger'd in Incest with the Mungrel Beast. Say Muse, for nothing can escape thy sight, (And, Painter wanting other, draw this fight) Who in an English Senate fierce debate Could raise so long for this new Whore of State. Of early Wittalls first the Troop marcht in; For diligence renown'd, and Discipline. In loyal haste they left young Wives in bed, And Denham these with one consent did head. Of the old Courtiers next a Squadron came, That sold their Master, led by Ashburnham. To them succeeds a despicable Rout, But knew the word, and well could face about; Expectants pale with hopes of Spoil allur'd, Thô yet but Pioneers, and led by Steward. Then damming Cowards rang'd the vocal plain: Wood these command, Knight of the Horn, and Cane; Still his hook-shoulder seems the blow to dread And under's arm-pit he defends his head. The posture strange men laught at, of his pole, Hid with his Elbow like the Spice he stole: Headless St. Dennis so his head does bear, And both of them alike French Martyrs were. Court Officers, as us'd, the next place took, And follow'd F???x, but with disdainful look: His birth, his youth, his brokage all dispraise In vain: For always he commands that pays. Then the procurers under Progers fil'd, Gentlest of men, and his Lieutenant mild; Bronkard Love's Squire, thrô all the Field array'd, No Troop was better clad, nor so well pay'd. Then marcht the Troop of Clarendon all full, Haters of Fowl, to Teal preferring Bull: Gross bodies, grosser Minds, and grosser Cheats, And bloated Wren conducts them to their Seats. Charleton advances next (whose Wife does awe The Mitred Troop) and with his looks gives Law He marches with Beaver cockt of Bishops Brimm, And hid much fraud under an aspect grimme. Next the Lawyers mercenary Band appear, F???ch in the front, and Thurland in the rear. The Troop of Priviledge, a Rabble bare Of Debtors deep, fell to Trelawny's care; Their Fortunes errour they supply'd in Rage, Nor any further would than these ingage. Then marcht the Troop whose valiant Acts before (Their publick Acts) oblig'd them to do more. For Chimnies sake they all Sir Pool obey'd, Or in his absence him that first it laid. Then come the thrifty Troop of Privateers Whose horses each with other interferes, Before them Higgons rides with brow compact, Mourning his Countess anxious for his Act. Sir Frederick and Sir Solomon draw lots For the Command of Politicks and Scots; Thence fell to words, but quarrels to adjourn, Their friends agreed they should command by turn. Carteret the rich did the Accountants guide And in ill English all the world defy'd. The Papist (but of those the House had none Else) Talbot offer'd to have led them on. Bold Duncomb next of the projectors chief, And old Fitz Harding of the Eaters Beef. Late and disorder'd out the Drunkards drew, Scarce them their Leaders, they their Leaders knew. Before them enter'd equal in command Apsley and Brotherick marching hand in hand. Last then but one Powel that could not ride Led the French Standard weltring in his stride; He, to excuse his slowness, truth confest, That 'twas so long before he could be drest. The Lords Sons last all these did reinforce, Cornbury before them manag'd Hobby-Horse. Never before, nor since an Host so steel'd Troopt on to Muster in the Tuttle field. Not the first Cock-horse that with Cork was shod To rescue Albemarle from the Sea-Cod: Nor the late Feather-men whom Tomkins fierce Shall with one breath like Thistle-down disperse. All, the two Coventries their Generals chose, For one had much, the other naught to lose. Nor better choice all accidents could hit, While Hector Harry steers by Will the Wit. They both accept the charge with merry glee, To fight a Battle from all Gun-shot free. Pleas'd with their Numbers, yet in Valour wise, They feign a Parley, better to surprize; They that e're long shall the rude Dutch upbraid, Who in a time of Treaty durst Invade. Thick was the Morning, and the House was thin, The Speaker early, when they all fell in. Propitious Heavens! had not you them crost, Excise had got the day, and all been lost: For t'other side all in loose Quarters lay Without Intelligence, Command, or Pay. A scatter'd body which the Foe ne're tri'd, But often did among themselves divide. And some ran o're each Night, while others sleep, And undescry'd return'd 'fore Morning peep. But Strangeways that all Night still walk the round, For Vigilance and Courage both renown'd; First spy'd the Enemy, and gave the Allarm, Fighting it single till the rest might Arm: Such Roman Cocles stood before the Foe, The falling Bridge behind, the Streams below. Each ran as Chance him guides to several post, And all to pattern his Example, boast; Their former Trophies they recal to mind, And to new edge their angry courage grind. First enter'd forward Temple, Conqueror Of Irish Cattle, and Solicitor; Then daring S????r, that with Spear and Shield Had stretcht the Monster Patent on the field. Keen Whorwood next in aid of Damsel frail, That pierc'd the Gyant Mordant through his Mayl: And surly Williams the Accountants Bane, And Lovelace young of Chimny-men the Cane. Old Waller, Trumpet General, swore he'd write This combat truer than the Naval fight. Of birth, state, wit, strength, courage, Howr'd presumes, And in his breast wears many Montezumes. These with some more with single valour stay The adverse Troops, and hold them all at Bay. Each thinks his person represents the whole, And with that thought does multiply his soul; Believes himself an Army; theirs, one man; As easily conquer'd, and believing, can With heart of Bees so full. and head of Mites, That each, though Duelling, a battle fights. Such once Orlando famous in Romance, Broacht whole Brigades like Larks upon his lance. But strength at last still under number bows, And the faint sweat trickl'd down Temples brows; Even Iron Strangewayes chafing yet gave back, Spent with fateigue, to breathe a while Toback— When marching in, a seasonable recruit Of Citizens, and Merchants, held dispute, And charging all their Pikes, a sullen band Of Presbyterian Switzers made a stand. Nor could all these the field have long maintain'd, But for th'unknown resérve that still remain'd; A gross of English Gentry nobly born, Of clear Estates, and to no Faction sworn, Dear Lovers of their King, and Death to meet For Countreys cause, that glorious thing and sweet, To speak not forward, but in action brave, In giving generous, but in Council grave: Candidly credulous for once; nay twice: But sure the Devil can't cheat them thrice. The Van and Battle, thô retiring, falls Without disorder in their Intervals; Then closing all in equal front, fall on, Led by great Garr'way, and great L???on. Lee equal to obey, or to command Adjutant General was still at hand. The Marshal Standard Sands displaying shows St. Dunstan in it tweaking Satan's Nose. See, sudden chance of War to paint, or write, Is longer work, and harder than to fight: At the first charge the Enemy give out, And the Excise receives a total rout. Broken in courage, yet the men the same, Resolve henceforth upon their other game; Where force had fail'd, with Stratagem to play, And what haste lost, recover by delay. St. Alban's strait is sent to, to forbear, Lest the sure Peace (forsooth) too soon appear. The Seamens clamours to three ends they use, To cheat their pay, seign want, and th'House accuse. Each day they bring the tale, and that too true, How strong the Dutch their Equipage renew. Mean time thrô all the Yards their Orders run, To lay the Ships up, cease the Keels begun. The Timber rots, the useless Axe does rust; Th'unpractis'd Saw lies buryed in its dust; The busie Hammer sleeps, the Ropes untwine, The Stores and Wages all are mine and thine. Along the Coasts and Harbours they take care That Money lacks, nor Forts be in repair. Long thus they could against the House conspire, Load them with envy, and with sitting tire: And the lov'd King, and never yet deny'd, Is brought to beg in publick, and to chide: But when this fail'd, and Months enough were spent, They with the first days proffer seem content; And to Land-Tax from the Excise turn round, Bought off with Eighteen hundred thousand pound. Thus like fair Thieves, the Commons Purse they share, But all the Members lives consulting spare. Blither than Hare that hath escap'd the Hounds, The House prorogu'd, the Chancellour rebounds. Not so decripet Æson hasht and stew'd With Magick Herbs rose from the Pot renew'd; And with fresh age felt his glad Limbs unite, His Gout (yet still he curst) had left him quite. What Frosts to Fruits, what Arsnick to the Rat, What to fair Denham mortal Chocolat; What an account to Carteret, that and more A Parliament is to the Chancellour. So the sad Tree shrinks from the morning's Eye, But blooms all Night, and shoots its Branches high. So at the Suns recess, again returns The Comet dread, and Earth and Heaven burns. Now Mordant may within his Castle Tower Imprison Parents, and the Child deflower. The Irish Herd is now let loose, and comes By Millions over, not by Hecatombs: And now, now the Canary Patent may Be broach't again for the great Holy-day. See how he reigns in his new Palace culminant And sits in state Divine like Jove the Fulminant. First Buckingham that durst 'gainst him rebel, Blasted with Lightning, struck with Thunder fell. Next the twelve Commons are Condemn'd to Groan, And roll in vain at Sisiphus's Stone. But still he car'd, whilst in Revenge he brav'd That Peace secur'd, and Mony might be sav'd, Gain and Revenge, Revenge and Gain are sweet, United most, then when by turns they meet. France had St. Albans promis'd (so they Sing) St. Albans promis'd him, and he the King. The Count forthwith is ordered all to close, To Play for Flanders, and the stake to lose. While chain'd together, two Embassadours Like Slaves shall beg for Peace at Hollands Doors. This done, among his Cyclops he retires To forge new Thunder, and inspect their Fires. The Court as once of War, now fond of Peace, All to new sports their wanton fears release. From Greenwich (where Intelligence they hold) Comes news of Pastime Martial and old. A punishment invented first to awe Masculine Wives transgressing Natures Law; Where when the brawny female disobeys And beats the Husband, till for Peace he prays, No concern'd Jury dammage for him finds, Nor partial Justice her behaviour binds; But the just Street does the next house invade, Mounting the Neighbour couple on lean Jade; The Distaff knocks, the Grains from Kettle fly, And Boys and Girles in Troops run hooting by. Prudent Antiquity! that knew by shame, Better than Law, Domestick Brawls to tame; And taught Youth by spectacle Innocent, So thou and I dear Painter represent In quick Effigie; others faults, and feign, By making them ridic'lous, to restrain: With homely sight they chose thus to relax The joys of State for the new Peace and Tax. So Holland with us had the Mastery try'd, And our next Neighbours, France and Flanders ride. But a fresh News the great designment nips Off, at the Isle of Candy, Dutch and Ships. Bab May, and Arlington did wisely scoff, And thought all safe, if they were so far off; Modern Geographers! 'Twas there they thought Where Venice twenty years the Turks had fought, (While the first year our Navy is but shewn, The next divided, and the third we've none.) They by the Name mistook it for that Isle Where Pilgrim Palmer travell'd in Exile, With the Bulls horn to measure his own Head, And on Phasiphae's Tomb to drop a bead. But Morrice Learn'd demonstrates by the Post, This Isle of Candy was on Essex Coast. Fresh Messengers still the sad news assure, More timerous now we are than first secure. False terrours our believing fears devise, And the French Army one from Calais spies. Bennet and May, and those of shorter reach, Change all for Guineas and a Crown for each; But wiser Men, and Men foreseen in chance In Holland theirs had Lodg'd before, and France. White-Hall's unsafe, the Court all meditates To fly to Windsor and mure up the Gates. Each doth the other blame, and all distrust, (But Mordant new oblig'd would sure be just.) Not such a fatal stupefaction reign'd At Londons Flames, nor to the Court complain'd. The Bloodworth Chanc'lor gives, (then does recall) Orders, amaz'd, at last gives none at all. St. Albans writ too, that he may bewail To Monr. Lewis and tell Coward tale, How that the Hollanders do make a noise, Threaten to beat us, and are naughty Boys. Now Doleman's disobedient, and they still Uncivil, his unkindness would us kill. Tell him our Ships unrigg'd, our Forts unman'd, Oru Money's spent, else 'twere at his command; Summon him therefore of his word, and prove To move him out of pity, if not love; Pray him to make D' Wit and Ruyter cease, And whip the Dutch, unless they'lhold their peace. But Lewis was of memory but dull, And to St. Albans too undutiful: Nor word, nor near Relation did revere, But askt him bluntly for his Character. The gravell'd Count did with this Answer faint, (His Character was that which thou didst paint) And so inforc'd like Enemy or Spie, Trusses his Baggage, and the Camp does flie: Yet Lewis writes, and lest our heart should break, Condoles us morally out of Seneque. Two Letters next unto Breda are sent, In Cypher one to Harry excellent: The first entrusts (our Verse that Name abhors) Plenipotentiary Embassadors; To prove by Scripture, Treaty does imply Cessation, as the Look Adultery; And that by Law of Arms, in Martial strife, Who yields his Sword, has title to his Life. Presbyter Hollis the first point should clear, The second Coventry the Cavalier: But would they not be argu'd back from Sea, Then to return home strait infectâ re. But Harry's order'd if they won't recall Their Fleet, to threaten—we will give them all. The Dutch are then in Proclamation shent, For sin against the eleventh Commandement. Hides flippant style there pleasantly curvets, Still his sharp wit on States and Princes whets: So Spain could not escape his laughters spleen, None but himself must choose the King a Queen. But when he came the odious clause to pen, That summons up the Parliament agen, His Writing-master many times he bann'd, And wisht himself the Gout to seize his hand; Never old Lecher more repugnance felt, Consenting for his Rupture to be gelt. But still in hope he solac't e're they come To work the Peace, aud so to send them home; Or in their hasty call, to find a flaw, Their Acts to vitiate, and them over-aw: But more rely'd upon this Dutch pretence, To raise a two-edg'd Army for's defence. First then he marcht our whole Militia's force, (As if alas we Ships, or Dutch had Horse,) Then from the usual common place he blames These, and in standing Armies praise declaims: And the wise Court that alway lov'd it dear, Now thinks all but too little for their fear. Hide stamps, and strait upon the ground the swarms Of currant Myrmidons appear in Arms; And for their pay he writes as from the King, With that curs'd quill pluckt from a Vultures wing, Of the whole Nation now to ask a Loan; (The Eighteen hundred thousand pounds are gone,) This done, he pens a Proclamation stout In rescue of the Bankers Banquerout. His Minion-Imps that in his secret part Lye nuzzling at the Sacramental Wart; Horse-leeches sucking at the Hæm'rhoid Vein, He sucks the King, they him, he them a gain. The Kingdoms Farm he lets to them bids least; (Greater the Bribe) and cheats at Interest. Here men induc'd by safety, gain, and ease, Their Money lodge, confiscate when he please: These can at need, at instant with a Scrip (This lik't him best) his Cash beyond Sea whip; When Dutch invade, and Parliament prepare; How can he Engines so convenient spare? Let no man touch them, or demand his own, 'Pain of displeasure of great Clarendon. The State affairs thus marshall'd, for the rest, Monk in his shirt against the Dutch is prest. Often (dear Painter) have I sate and mus'd Why he should still b' on all adventures us'd: Do they for nothing ill like Ashen-wood, Or think him like Herb-John for nothing good? Whether his Valour they so much admire, Or that for cowardise they all retire. As, Heaven in Storms they call, in gusts of State On Monk and Parliament, yet both do hate. All causes sure concur, but most they think Under Herculean labours he may sink. Soon then the Independent Troops would close, And Hides last project of his place dispose: Ruyter the while that had our Ocean curb'd, Sail'd now amongst our Rivers undisturb'd; Survey'd their Crystal-streams, and banks so green, And beauties e're this never naked seen: Through the vain Sedge the bashful Nymphs he ey'd, Bosoms, and all which from themselves they hide. The Sun much brighter, and the Sky more clear He finds, the air and all things sweeter here: The sudden change, and such a tempting sight Swells his old veins with fresh blood, fresh delight. Like am'rous Victors, he begins to shave, And his new face looks in the English wave. His sporting Navy all about him swim, And witness their complacence in their trim. Their streaming silks play through the weather fair, And with inveigling colours court the air. While the Red Flags breath on their top-masts high Terrour and War, but want an Enemy. Among the Shrouds the Sea-men sit and sing, And wanton boys on every rope do cling: Old Neptune Springs the Tydes, and Waters lent, (The Gods themselves do help the provident) And where the deep Keel on the shallow cleaves, With Trident's Leaver and great Shoulder heaves. Æolus their Sails inspires with Eastern wind, Puffs them along, and breathes upon them kind. With pearly Shell, the Tritons all the while Sound the Sea-march, and guide to Sheppy Isle. So have I seen in Aprils bud arise, A Fleet of clouds sailing along the skies. The liquid Region with their Squadrons fill'd, Their airy sterns the Sun behind does guild, And gentle gales them steer, and Heaven drives, When all on sudden their calm bosom rives With Thunder and Lightning from each armed cloud, Shepherds themselves in vain in Bushes shroud. So up the Stream the Belgick Navy glides, And at Sheerness unloads its stormy sides. Sprag there, though practis'd in the Sea command, With panting heart lay like a Fish on Land, And quickly judg'd the Fort was not tenable; Which if a house, yet were not tenantable. No man can sit there safe, the Canon pours Through the walls untight, and Bullets showers. The neighbourhood ill, and an unwholsom seat, So at the first salute resolves retreat; And swore, that he would never more dwell there, Until the City put it in repair. So he in front, his Garrison in rear, Marcht streight to Chatham to increase the fear: There our sick Ships unrigg'd in Summer lay, Like moulting fowl, a weak and easie Prey: For whose strong bulk Earth scarce could timber find, The Ocean water, or the Heavens wind. Those Oaken Gyants of the ancient race, That rul'd all Seas and did our Channel Grace. The conscious Stag, thô once the Forrest's dread, Fys to the Wood and hides his armless head: Ruyter forthwith a Squadron does untack, They sail securely through the Rivers track. An English Pilot too (Oh shame! Oh sin!) Cheated of's pay, was he that shew'd them in. Our wretched Ships within their fate attend, And all our hopes now on frail Chain depend: (Engine so slight to guard us from the Sea, It fitter seem'd to captivate a Flea.) A Skipper rude shocks it without respect, Filling his Sayls more force to recollect. Th'English from shore the Iron deaf invoke For its ast aid, Hold Chain, or we are broke! But with her sayling weight the Holand Keel, Snapping the brittle links, does thorough reel, And to the rest the opened passage shew: Monk from the bank that dismal sight does view. Our feather'd Gallants which came down that day To be Spectators safe of the New Play, Leave him alone when first they hear the Gun, (Cornb'ry the fleetest) and to London run. Our Seamen, whom no dangers shape could fright, Unpaid, refuse to mount our Ships for spight: Or to their fellows swim on board the Dutch, Who shew the tempting Metal in their clutch. Oft had he sent, of Duncomb and of Legg Cannon and Powder, but in vain, to beg. And Upnor Castle's ill deserted Wall, Now needful does for Ammunition call. He finds, wheres'ere he succour might expect, Confusion, Folly, Treach'ry, Fear, Neglect. But when the Royal Charles (what rage! what grief!) He saw seiz'd, and could give her no relief; That Sacred Keel that had, as he, restor'd It's exil'd Sov'raign on its happy board, And thence the British Admiral became, Crown'd for that merit with his Masters Name: That Pleasure-boat of War, in whose dear side Secure, so oft he had this Foe defy'd, Now a cheap Spoyl, and the mean Victors slave, Taught the Dutch colours from its top to wave; Of former glories the reproachful thought With present shame compar'd, his mind distraught. Such from Euphrates bank a Tigress fell After her Robbers for her Whelps does yell; But sees enrag'd the River flow between, Frustrate Revenge, and Love by loss more keen; At her own breast her useless claws does arm, She tears her self, 'cause him she cannot harm. The Guards plac'd for the Chain's and Fleet's defence, Long since were fled on many a feign'd pretence. Daniel had there adventur'd, man of might, Sweet Painter, draw his Picture while I write. Paint him of Person tall, and big of Bone, Large Limbs like Oxe, not to be kill'd but shewn; Scarce can burnt Iv'ry feign a hair so black, Or face so red, thine Oker and thy Lack; Mix a vain terrour in his Martial look, And all those lines by which men are mistook; But when by shame constrain'd to go on Board, He heard how the wild Cannon nearer roar'd, And saw himself confin'd like Sheep in Pen, Daniel then thought he was in Lions Den: But when the frightful Fire-Ships he saw, Pregnant with Sulphur nearer to him draw, Captain, Lieutenant, Ensign, all make hast, E're in the fiery Furnace they be cast; Three Children tall unsing'd, away they row, Like Shadrack, Mesheck and Abednego. Each doleful Day still with fresh loss returns, The Loyal London now a third time burns. And the true Royal Oak and Royal James, Ally'd in Fate, encrease with theirs her flames. Of all our Navy none should now survive, But that the Ships themselves were taught to dive; And the kind River in its Creek them hides, Fraughting their pierced Keels with Ouzy sides; Up to the Bridge contagious terror struck, The Tow'r it self with the near danger shook, And were not Ruyter's Maw with ravage cloy'd, Ev'n Londons ashes had been then destroy'd. Officious fear however to prevent, Our loss does so much more our loss augment. The Dutch had robb'd those Jewels of the Crown, Our Merchant men, lest they should burn, we drown; So when the Fire did not enough devour, The Houses were demolisht near the Tow'r. Those Ships that yearly from their teeming hole Unloaded here the Birth of either Pole, Fir from the North, and Silver from the West, From the South Perfumes, Spices form the East; From Gambo Gold, and from the Ganges Jems, Take a short Voyage underneath the Thames: Once a deep River, now with Timber floor'd, And shrunk, less navigable, to a Ford. Now nothing more at Chathams left to burn, The Holland Squadron leisurely return, And spight of Ruperts and of Albermarles, To Ruyters Triumph led the Captive Charles. The pleasing sight he often does prolong, Her Mast erect, tough Cordage, Timber strong, Her moving shape, all these he doth survey, And all admires, but most his easie Prey. The Seamen search her all within, without, Viewing her strength they yet their conquest doubt; Then with rude shouts secure, the Air they vex, With gamesom joy insulting on her Decks; Such the fear'd Hebrew Captive, blinded, shorn, Was led about in sport, the publick scorn. Black day accurst! on thee let no man hale Out of the Port, or dare to hoyse a Sail, Or row a Boat in thy unlucky hour, Thee, the years Monster, let thy Dam devour; And constant time to keep his course yet right, Fill up thy space with a redoubled Night. When aged Thames was bound with Fetters base, And Medway chaste ravisht before his face, And their dear Offspring murder'd in their sight, Thou and thy fellows heldst the odious light. Sad chance since first that happy Pair was wed, When all the Rivers grac'd their Nuptial bed, And father Neptune promis'd to resign His Empire old to their Immortall line; Now with vain grief their vainer hopes they rue, Themselves dishonour'd, and the gods untrue; And to each other helpless couple mourn, As the sad Tortoise for the Sea do's groan: But most they for their darling Charles complain, And were it burnt, yet less would be their pain. To see that fatal Pledge of Sea command, Now in the Ravisher de Ruyters hand, The Thames roar'd, swooning Medway turn'd her tyde, And were they mortal, both for grief had dy'd. The Court in Farthing yet it self do's please, (And female Steward there rules the four Seas,) But Fate does still accumulate our Woes, And Richmond her commands as Ruyter those. After this loss, to relish Discontent, Some one must be accus'd by punlishment; All our miscarriages on Pett must fall, His Name alone seems fit to answer all. Whose Counsel first did this mad War beget? Who all Commands fold through the Navy? Pett. Who would not follow when the Dutch were beat? Who treated out the Time at Bergen? Pett. Who the Dutch Fleet with Storms disabled met? And rifling Prizes them neglected? Pett. Who with false News prevented the Gazette, The Fleet divided, writ for Rupert? Pett. Who all our Sea-men cheated of their debt, And all our Prizes who did swallow? Pett. Who did advise no Navy out to set? And who the Forts left unprepared? Pett. Who to supply with Powder did forget Languard, Sheerness, Gravesend and Upnor? Pett! Who all our Ships expos'd in Chattam Nett? Who should it be, but the Fanatick Pett? Pett, the Sea-architect in making Ships, Was the first Cause of all these Naval slips. Had he not built, none of these faults had been; If no Creation, there had been no sin. But his great Crime, one Boat away he sent, That lost our Fleet, and did our flight prevent. Then that reward might in its turn take place, And march with Punishment in equal pace, Southampton dead, much of the Treasure's care And place in Council fell to Duncombs share. All men admir'd, he to that pitch could fly, Powder ne're blew man up so soon, so high: But sure his late good husbandry in Peeter, Shew'd him to manage the Exchequer meeter; And who the Forts would not vouchsafe a Corn, To lavish the Kings Money more would scorn. Who hath no Chimneys, to give all, is best, And ablest Speaker, who of Law hath least. Who less Estate for Treasurer most fit, And for a Chanc'lour he that has least wit. But the true Cause was that in's Brother May, Th'Exchequer might the privy Purse obey. And now draws near the Parliaments return, Hide and the Court again begin to mourn; Frequent in Council, earnest in debate, All Arts they try how to prolong its date. Grave Primate Shelden (much in Preaching there) Blames the last Session, and this more do's fear; With Boynton or with Middleton 'twere sweet, But with a Parliament abhors to meet, And thinks 'twill ne're be well within this Nation, 'Till it be govern'd by a Convocation. But in the Thames mouth still de Ruyter lay'd, The Peace not sure, new Army must be pay'd; Hide saith he hourly waits for a Dispatch, Harry came Post just as he shew'd his Watch; All to agree the Articles were clear, The Holland Fleet and Parliament so near: Yet Harry must jobb back and all mature, Binding e're th'Houses meet the Treaty sure; And 'twixt necessity and spight, till then Let them come up so to go down agen. Up ambles Country Justice on his Pad, And Vest bespeaks to be more seemly clad; Plain Gentlemen are in Stage-Coach o'rethrown, And Deputy Lieutenants in their own; The portly Burghess through the weather hot Do's for his Corporation sweat and trot; And all with Sun and Choller come adust, And threaten Hide to raise a greater dust. But fresh, as from the Mint, the Courtiers fine Salute them, smiling at their vain design; And Turner gay up to his Perch doth march, With Face new bleacht, smoothed and stiff with Starch Tells them he at White-hall had took a turn, And for three dayes thence moves them to adjourn. Not so, quoth Tomkins. and straight drew his Tongue, Trusty as Steel that always ready hung, And so proceeding in his motion warm, Th'Army soon rais'd he doth as soon disarm. True Trojan! whilst this Town can Girls afford, And long as Cyder lasts in Hereford, The Girls shall always kiss thee though grown old, And in eternal Healths thy Name be troul'd. Mean while the certain News of Peace arrives At Court, so reprieves their Guilty Lives. Hyde order Turner that he should come late, Least some new Tomkins spring a fresh debate: The King that day rais'd early from his rest, Expects as at a Play till Turner's drest; At last together Eaton came and he, No Dial more could with the Sun agree: The Speaker summon'd to the Lords repairs, Nor gave the Commons leave to say their Pray'rs, But like his Pris'ners to the Bar them led, Where mute, they stand to hear their Sentence read; Trembling with Joy, and fear Hide, them Prorogues, And had almost mistook, and call'd them Rogues. Dear Painter, draw this Speaker to the Foot, Where Pencil cannot, there my Pen shall do't. That may his Body, this his Mind explain; Paint him in golden Gown, with Maces train, Bright Hair, fair Face, obscure, and dull of Head, Like Knife with Iv'ry haft, and edge of Lead: At Pray'rs his eyes turn up the pious white, But all the while his private Bill's in sight: In Chair he smoaking sits like Master-Cook, And a Poll-bill do's like his Apron look. Well was he skill'd to season any Question, And make a Sawce fit for White-halls digestion: Whence every day the Palate more to tickle, Court-Mushroms ready are sent in to pickle. When Grievance's urg'd he swells like squatted Toad, Frisks like a Frog to croak a Taxes load; His Patient, Piss he could hold longer, than An Urinal, and sit like any Hen: At Table jolly as a Country Host, And soaks his Sack with Norfolk like a Toast; At Night than Chanticlere more brisk and hot, And Serjeants Wife serves him for Pertelott. Paint last the King and a dead shade of Night, Only disperst by a weak Tapers light: And those bright Gleams that dart along and glare From his clear Eyes (yet these too dart with care;) There as in the calm horror all alone, He wakes and muses of th'uneasie Throne: Raise up a sudden shape with Virgins Face, Though ill agree her posture, hour or place; Naked as born, and her round Arms behind, With her own Tresses interwove and twin'd: Her Mouth lockt up, a blind before her Eyes, Yet from beneath her Veil her blushes rise, And silent tears her secret Anguish speak, Her Heart throbs, and with very shame would break, The Object strange in him no terror mov'd, He wondred first, then pityed, then he lov'd; And with kind hand do's the coy Vision press, Whose Beauty greater seem'd by her distress; But soon shrunk back chill'd with a touch so cold, And th'airy Picture vanisht from his hold; In his deep thoughts the wonder did increase, And he divin'd 'twas England or the Peace. Express him startling, next with list'ning ear, As one that some unusual Noise doth hear; With Cannons, Trumpets, Drums his door surround, But let some other Painter draw the Sound; Thrice he did rise, thrice the vain Tumult fled, But again Thunders when he lyes in Bed. His mind secure do's the vain stroke repeat, And finds the Drums Lewis's March did beat. Shake then the Room and all his Curtains tear, And with blew streaks infect the Taper clear, While the pale Ghosts his Eye doth fixt admire, Of Grandsire Harry and of Charles his Syre; Harry sits down and in his Open-side The grisly Wound reveals of which he dy'd; And Ghostly Charles turning his Coller low, The purple thred about his Neck doth shew: Then whisp'ring to his Son in words unheard, Through the lockt Door, both of them disappear'd; The wondrous Night the pensive King revolves, And rising straight on Hides disgrace resolves. At his first step he Castlemain does find, Bennet and Coventry as 'twere design'd; And they not knowing, the same thing propose Which his hid Mind did in his depths inclose: Through their feign'd Speech their secret Hearts he knew, To her own Husband Castlemain untrue; False to his Master Bristol, Arlington. And Coventry falser than any one, Who to the Brother, Brother would betray; Nor therefore trusts himself to such as they. His Fathers Ghost too whisper'd him one Note, That who does cut his Purse will cut his Throat: But in wise Anger he their Crimes forbears, As Thieves repriev'd for Executioner: While Hide provok't his foaming Tusk do's whet To prove them Traytors, and himself the Pett. Painter, Adieu, how well our Arts agree, Poetick Picture, Painted Poetry! But this great work is for our Monarch fit, And henceforth Charles only to Charles shall sit. His Master-hand the Ancients hall out-do, Himself the Poet and the Painter too. To the KING. So his bold Tube Man to the Sun apply'd, And spots unknown in the bright Star descry'd, Shew'd they obscure him, while too near, they please And seem his Courtiers, are but his Disease. Through Optick Trunk the Planet seem'd to hear, And hurles them off e're since in his career. And you, (Great Sir) that with him Empire share, Seen of our World, as he the Charles is there; Blame not the Muse that brought those Spots to sight, Which in your Splendor hid, corrode your Light: (Kings in the Country oft have gone astray, Nor of a Peasant scorn'd to learn the way,) Would she the unattended Throne reduce, Banishing Love, Trust, Ornament and Use? Better it were to live in Cloysters lock, Or in fair Fields to rule the easie Flock; She blames them only who the Court restrain, And where all England serves, themselves would Reign. Bold and accurst are they that all this while Have strove to Isle this Monarch from this Isle; And to improve themselves by false pretence, About the common Prince have rais'd a Fence; The Kingdom from the Crown distinct would see, And peel the Bark to burn at last the Tree. But Ceres Corn, and Flora is the Spring, Bachcus is Wine, the Country is the King. Not so do's Rust insinuating wear, Nor Powder so the vaulted Bastion tear; Nor Earthquakes so an hollow Isle o'rewhelm, As scratching Courtiers undermine a Realm. And through the Palaces Foundations bore, Burrowing themselves to hoord their Guilty store: The smallest Vermin make the greatest wast, And a poor Warren once a City rac't. But they whom born to Virtue and to Wealth, Nor Guilt to Flatt'ry binds, nor want to Stealth; Whose generous Conscience, and whose Courage high, Do's with clear Councils their large Souls supply; That serve the King with their Estates and Care And as in Love on Parliament can stare; Where few the number, choice is there less hard; Give us this Court, and rule without a Guard. By A. M. The Loyal Scot. By Cleaveland's Ghost, upon the Death of Captain Douglas, burnt on his Ship at Chatham. Of the old Heroes, when the Warlike shades Saw Douglas marching on the Elysian Glades, They all consulting, gather'd in a Ring, Which of their Poets should his Welcome Sing; And as a favourable Penance chose Cleveland, on whom they would that task impose. He understood; but willingly addrest His ready Muse to Court that noble Guest. Much had he cur'd the tumour of his Vein, He judg'd more clearly now, and saw more plain; For those soft Airs had temper'd every Thought, And of wise Lethe he had drunk a Draught. Abruptly he began, disguising Art, As of his Satyr this had been a part. Not so, brave Douglas, on whose lovely Chin The early Down but newly did begin; And modest Beauty yet his Sex did veil, While envious Virgins hope he is a Male: His yellow Locks curle back themselves to seek, Nor other Courtship knew but to his Cheek: Oft as he in chill Esk or Seyn by Night, Hardned and cool'd, his Limbs so soft, so white; Among the Reeds to be espy'd by him The Nymphs would rustle, he would forwards swim; They sigh'd and said, Fond Boy why so untame, That fly'st Loves fires, reserv'd for other flame. First on his Ship he fac't that horrid day, And wondered much at those that run away: No other fear himself could comprehend, Than least Heav'n fall e're thither he ascend; But entertains the while his Time too short, With birding at the Dutch, as if in sport; Or waves his Sword, and could he them conjure Within its Circle, knows himself secure. The fatal Bark him boards with grappling fire. And safely through its Port the Dutch retire: That precious Life he yet disdains to save, Or with known Art to try the gentle wave; Much him the Honour of his Ancient race Inspir'd, nor would he his own deeds deface; And secret Joy in his calm Soul does rise, That Monk looks on to see how Douglas dyes. Like a glad Lover the fierce flames he meets, And tryes his first Embraces in their sheets: His shape exact which the bright flame infold Like the Suns Statue stands of burnisht Gold; Round the transparent Fire about him glowes, As the clear Amber on the Bees do's close; And as on Angels heads their glories shine, His burning Locks adorn his Face divine. But when in his immortal mind he felt His alt'ring form and soder'd limbs to melt, Down on the Deck he layd himself and dy'd, With his dear Sword reposing by his side; And on the flaming Plank so rests his head, As one that warm'd himself, and went to bed. His Ship burns down, and with his Reliques sinks, And the sad stream beneath his Ashes drinks. Fortunate Boy, if either Pencils fame, Or if my Verse can propagate thy Name, When Æta and Alcides are forgot, Our English Youth shall sing the valiant Scot. Skip Saddles Pegasus, thou needst not brag, Sometimes the Galloway proves the better Nag. Shall not a Death so generous, when told Unite our distance, fill our breaches old? Such in the Roman Forum, Curtius brave Galloping down, clos'd up the gaping Cave. No more discourse of Scotch and English Race, Nor chaunt the fabulous Hunt of Chevy-chace. Mixt in Corinthian Mettal at thy flame Our Nations melting, thy Colossus frame; Prick down the Point, whoever has the Art, Where Nature Scotland does from England part. Anatomists may sooner fix the Cells Where Life resides, and Understanding dwells: But this we know, thô that exceeds our skill, That whosoever separates them, does ill. Will you the Tweed that sullen Bounder call Of Soyl, of Wit, of Manners, and of all? Why draw you not as well the thrifty Line From Thames, from Humber, or at least the Tine? So may we the State Corpulence redress, And little England, when we please, make less. What Ethic River is this wondrous Tweed, Whose one bank Virtue, t'other Vice does breed? Or what new Perpendicular does rise Up from her Streams, continu'd to the Skies, That between us the common Air should bar, And split the Influence of every Star? But who considers right will find indeed, 'Tis Holy Island parts us, not the Tweed. Nothing but Clergy could us two seclude, No Scotch was ever like a Bishops feud. All Litanies in this have wanted Faith, There's no Deliver us! from a Bishops wrath. Never shall Calvin pardon'd be for Sales, Never for Burnet's sake, the Lauderdales, For Becket's sake Kent alwayes shall have Tails; Who Sermons e're can pacifie and Prayers? Or to the Joint-stools reconcile the Chairs? Thô Kingdoms joyn, yet Church will Kirk oppose, The Mitre still divides, the Crown does close; As in Rogation-week they whip us round, To keep in mind the Scotch and English bound: What the Ocean binds, is by the Bishops rent, Then Sees make Islands, in our Continent. Nature in vain us in one Land compiles, If the Cathedral still shall have its Isles. Nothing, not Bogs, not Sands, not Seas, not Alps, Separate the World, so as the Bishops Scalps. Stretch for the Line, their Circingle alone 'Twill make a more unhabitable Zone: The friendly Load-stone has not more combin'd, Than Bishops crampt the commerce of Mankind. Had it not been for such a Biass strong, Two Nations had ne're miss'd the mark so long. The World in all doth but two Nations bear, The Good, the Bad, and these mixt every where: Under each Pole place either of these two, The Bad will basely, Good will bravely do. And few indeed can parallel our Climes For Worth Heroick, or Heroick Crimes. The tryal would however be too nice, Which stronger were, a Scotch or English Vice; Or whether the fame Virtue would reflect From Scotch or English heart the same effect: Nation is all but Name, a Shiboleth, Where a mistaken Accent causes death. In Paradise Names only Nature show'd, At Babel Names from Pride and Discord flow'd; And ever since men with a female Spight First call each other Names, and then they fight. Scotland, and England, cause of just uproar, Do Man and Wife signifie, Rogue and Whore. Say but a Scot, and straight we fall to sides, That Syllable like a Picts Wall divides. Rational mens Words Pledges are of peace, Perverted, serve Dissention to increase. For shame extirpate from each Loyal breast, That Senceless Rancour against Interest. One King, one Faith, one Language, and one Isle, English and Scotch, 'tis all but Cross and Pile. Charles our Great Soul this only understands, He our affections both, and wills commands. And where twin Sympathies cannot atone, Knows the last Secret how to make us one. Just so the prudent Husbandman that sees, The idle tumult of his Factious Bees, The Morning Dews, and Flowers neglected grown, The Hive a Comb case, every Bee a Drone, Powders them o're, till none discerns his Foes, And all themselves in Meal and Friendship lose; The Infect Kingdom straight begins to thrive, And all work Honey for the common Hive. Pardon young Heroe, this so long Transport, Thy Death more Noble did the same extort. My former Satyr for this Verse forget, My fault against my Recantation set. I single did against a Nation write, Against a Nation thou didst single fight. My differing Crime does more thy Virtue raise, And such my rashness best thy Valour praise. Here Douglas smiling, said, He did intend After such frankness shewn, to be his Friend; Forewarn'd him therefore, lest in time he were Metempsycos'd to some Scotch Presbyter. By A. M Britannia and Raleigh. The attribution of this poem is questionable. By A. Marvell Esq. Brit. Ah Raleigh, when thou didst thy Breath resign To trembling James, would I had quitted mine, Cubs did'st thou call them? Hadst thou seen this Brood Of Earls, Dukes, and Princes of the Blood; No more of Scottish Race thou wouldst complain, These would be Blessings in this spurious Reign. Awake, arise from thy long blest Repose, Once more with me partake of Mortal Woes. Ra. What mighty Pow'r hath forced me from my rest? Oh mighty Queen, why so untimely drest? Brit. Favour'd by Night, conceal'd in this Disguise, Whilst the Lewd Court in drunken Slumber lies, I stole away, and never will return, Till England knows who did her City burn; Till Cavaliers shall Favourites be deem'd, And Loyal Sufferers by the Court esteem'd; Till Liegh and Galloway shall Bribes reject; Thus O?n's Golden Cheat I shall detect: Till Atheist Lauderdale shall leave this Land, And Commons Votes shall Cut-Nose Guards disband; Till Kate a happy Mother shall become, Till Charles loves Parliaments, and James hates Rome. Ral. What fatal Crimes make you for ever fly Your once lov'd Court and Martyrs Progeny? Brit. A Colony of French possess the Court; Pimps, Priests, Buffoons in Privy Chamber sport; Such slimy Monsters ne'r approacht a Throne Since Pharaoh's Days, nor so defil'd a Crown. In sacred Ear Tyrannick Arts they croak, Pervert his Mind, and good Intention choak; Tell him of Golden Indies, Fairy Lands, Leviathan, and absolute Commands. Thus Fairy-like the King they steal away, And in his room a Changling Lewis lay. How oft have I him to himself restor'd, In's left the Scale, in's right hand plac'd the Sword? Taught him their use, what dangers would ensue, To them who strive to separate these two? The bloody Scotish Chronicle read o're, Shew'd him how many Kings in purple gore Were hurll'd to Hell by cruel Tyrant Lore. The other day fam'd Spencer I did bring, In lofty Notes Tudor's blest Race to sing; How Spain's proud Powers her Virgin Arms controul'd, And Gold'n Days in peaceful Order roul'd; How like ripe Fruit she dropt from off her Throne, Full of grey Hairs, good Deeds, and great Renown. As the Jessean Hero did appease Sauls stormy Rage, and stopt his black Disease; So the learn'd Bard, with Artful Song supprest The swelling Passion of his canker'd Breast, And in his Heart kind Influences shed Of Countrys Love by Truth and Justice bred: Then, to perform the Cure so well begun, To him I shew'd this glorious setting Sun. How by her Peoples Looks pursu'd from far, So mounted on a bright Celestial Car, Out-shining Virgo, or the Julian Star. Whilst in Truths Mirrour this good Scene he spy'd, Enter'd a Dame, bedeckt with spotted Pride, Fair Flower-de-Luce within an Azure Field, Her left Hand bears the Ancient Gallick Shield, By her usurp'd; her Right a bloody Sword, Inscrib'd Leviathan, our Soveraign Lord; Her towry Front a fiery Meteor bears, And Exhalation bred of Blood and Tears; Around her Jove's lewd rav'nous Curs complain, Pale Death, Lust, Tortures, fill her pompous Train: She from the easie King Truth's Mirrour took, And on the Ground in spiteful Fall it broke; Then frowning, thus, with proud Disdain, she spoke: Are thred-bare Virtues Ornaments for Kings? Such poor Pedantick Toys teach Underlings! Do Monarchs rise by Virtue, or by Sword? Who e're grew great by keeping of his Word? Virtue's a faint Green-sickness to brave Souls, Dastards their Hearts, their active Heat controuls: The Rival God, Monarchs of th'other World, This mortal Poyson amongst Princes hurl'd; Fearing the mighty Projects of the great, Shall drive them from their proud Cœlestial Seat, If not o're aw'd: This new-found, holy Cheat, Those pious Frauds too slight, t'insnare the brave, Are proper Arts the long-ear'd Rout t'inslave. Bribe hungry Priests to deifie your Might, To teach your Will's, your only Rule to Right, And found Damnation to all that dare deny't. Thus Heaven designs 'gainst Heaven you shall turn, And make them feel those powers they once did scorn. When all the Gobling Interest of Mankind, By Hirelings sold to you, shall be resign'd; And by Impostures God and Man betray'd The Church and State you safely may invade: So boundless Lewis in full Glory shines, Whil'st your starv'd power in Legal Fetters pines. Shake off those Baby Bands from your strong Arms, Henceforth be deaf to that old Witches Charms; Tast the delicious Sweets of Sovereign power, 'Tis Royal Game whole Kingdoms to deflower. Three spotless Virgins to your Bed I'll bring, A Sacrifice to you their God and King: As these grow stale we'll harrass Humankind, Rack Nature till new pleasures you shall find, Strong as your Reign, and beauteous as your Mind. When she had spoke a confus'd Murmur rose, Of French, Scotch, Irish, all my mortal Foes; Some English too, O shame! disguis'd I spy'd, Led all by the wise Son-in-Law of Hide; With Fury drunk, like Bachanals they Roar, Down with that common Magna Charta Whore: With joynt Consent on helpless Me they flew, And from my Charles to a base Goal me drew; My Reverend Age expos'd to Scorn and Shame, To Prigs, Bawds, Whores, was made the publick Game. Frequent Addresses to my Charles I send, And my sad State did to his Care commend; But his fair Soul transform'd by that French Dame, Had lost a sense of Honour, Justice, Fame. Like a tame Spinster in's Seraigl he sits, Beseig'd by Whores, Buffoons, and Bastards Chits; Lull'd in Security, rowling in Lust, Resigns his Crown to Angel Carwells Trust. Her Creature O? the Revenue steals, False F???h, Knave Ang?esy, misguide the Seals; Mack-James the Irish Biggots does adore; His French and Teague commands on sea and shore: The Scotch Scalado of our Court two Isles, False L?le with Ordure all defiles. Thus the States Night-mar'd by this Hellish rout, And no one left these Furies to cast out: Ah Vindex come, and purge the poison'd State; Descend, Descend, e're the Cure's desperate. Ral. Once more great Queen thy Darling strive to save, Snatch him again from scandal and the Grave; Present to's Thoughts his long scorn'd Parliament, The Basis of his Throne and Government: In his deaf, Ears sound his dead Fathers Name; Perhaps that Spell may's Erring Soul reclaim: Who knows what good Effects from thence may spring? 'Tis God-like Good to save a falling King. Brit. Rawleigh, no more; for long in vain I've try'd, The S?t, from the Tyrant to divide; As easily learn'd Virtuoso's may With the Dogs Blood his gentle Kind Convey Into the Wolf, and make him Guardian turn; To the bleating Flock, by him so lately torn: If this Imperial Juice once taint his Blood, 'Tis by no potent Antidote withstood. Tyrants, like Leprous Kings, for publick weal, Should be immur'd, lest the Contagion steal Over the whole. Th'Elect of the Jessean Line, To this firm Law their Scepter did resign, And shall this base Tyrannick Brood evade Eternal Laws, by God for Mankind made. To the serene Venetian State I'll go, From her sage Mouth fam'd Principles to know; With her, the prudence of the Ancients read, To teach my People in their steps to tread: By their great Pattern such a State I'le frame, Shall eternize a glorious lasting Name. Till then, my Raleigh teach our noble Youth, To love Sobriety and holy Truth: Watch and preside over their tender Age, Lest Court, Corruption should their Soul engage: Teach them how Arts and Arms in thy young Days Employ'd our Youth, not Taverns, Stews and Plays: Tell them the generous Scorn their rise does owe To Flattery, Pimping and a Gawdy Shew; Teach them to scorn the Carwells, Portsms, Nells, The Clevelands, O?, Berties, Lau?ails, Poppea, Tegoline and Arteria's Name, Who yield to these in Lewdness, Lust and Fame. Make 'em admire the Talbots, Sidneys, Veres, Drake, Cav'ndish, Blake, Men void of slavish Fears, True Sons of Glory, Pillars of the State, On whose fam'd Deeds all Tongues and Writers wait; When with fierce Ardour their bright Souls do burn, Back to my dearest Country I'll return. Tarquin's just Judge and Cæsar's equal Peers, With them I'll bring, to dry my Peoples Tears. Publicola with healing Hands shall pour Balm in their Wounds, and shall their Life restore: Greek Arts and Roman Arms in her conjoyn'd, Shall England raise, relieve opprest Mankind. As Jove's great Son th'infested Globe did free From noxious Monsters, hell born Tyranny; So shall my England in a Holy War, In Triumph lead chain'd Tryrants from a far; Her true Crusado shall at last pull down The Turkish Crescent and the Persian Sun. Freed by thy Labours, Fortunate Blest Isle, The Earth shall rest, the Heaven shall on thee smile; And this kind Secret for Reward shall give, No Poyson'd Tyrants on thy Earth shall live. Advice to a Painter, by A. Marvell Esqr; The attribution of this poem is questionable. Spread a large Canvass, Painter, to contain The great Assembly, and the num'rous Train; Where all about him shall in Triumph sit Abhoring Wisdom and despising Wit, Hating all Justice and resolv'd to Fight, To rob their Native Country of their Right; First draw His Highness prostrate to the South, Adoring Rome, this Label in his Mouth. Most Holy Father, being joyn'd in League With Father Patrick, D?, and with Teague, Thrown at your Sacred Feet, I humbly bow, I and the wife Associates of my Vow; A Vow, nor Fire nor Sword shall ever end, Till all this Nation to your Foot-stool bend: Thus arm'd with Zeal and Blessings from your Hands, I'll raise my Papists, and my Irish Bands; And by a Noble well-contrived Plot, Manag'd by wife Fitzgerrald and by Scot, Prove to the World, I'll make Old England know, That common Sence is my Eternal Foe. I ne're can fight in a more glorious Cause, Than to destroy their Liberty and Laws, Their House of Commons, and their House of Lords, Their Parchment Precedents and dull Records; Shall these e're dare to contradict my Will, And think a Prince oth' Blood can e're do Ill? It is our Birth-right to have Power to kill. Shall they e're dare to think they shall decide The Way to Heaven, and who shall be my Guide? Shall they pretend to say, That Bread is Bread, If we affirm it is a God in deed; Or that there's no Purgatory for the Dead? That Extream Unction is but common Oyl, And not Infallible the Roman Soil? I'll have these Villains in our Notions rest, And I do say it, therefore it's the best. Next Painter, draw his Mordant by his side, Conveying his Religion and his Bride; He who long since abjur'd the Royal Line, Does now in Popery with his Master joyn: Then draw the Princess with her golden Locks, Hastning to be envenom'd with the P? And in her youthful Veins receive a Wound, Which sent N. H. before her, under Ground; The Wound of which the tainted Ch?t fades, Laid up in Store for a new Set of Maids. Poor Princess, born under a sullen Star, To find such Welcome when you came so far! Better some jealous Neighbour of your own Had call'd you to a Sound, tho' petty Throne! Where, 'twixt a wholesome Husband and a Page, You might have linger'd out a lazy Age, Than on dull Hopes of being here a Q? E're twenty dye, and rot before fifteen. Now Painter shew us in the Blackest Dye, The Counsellors of all this Villany: Clifford, who first appear'd in humble guise, Was always thought too Gentle, Meek and Wife: But when he came to act upon the Stage, He prov'd the mad Cethegus of our Age; He and his Duke had both too great a Mind, To be by Justice or by Law confin'd; Their boyling Heads can hear no other Sounds Than Fleets and Armies, Battails, Blood and Wounds; And to destroy our Liberty they hope, By Irish Fools, and an old doting Pope. Next Talbot must by his great Master stand, Laden with Folly, Flesh, and Ill-got Land; He's of a size indeed to fill a Porch, But ne're can make a Pillar of the Church; His Sword is all his Argument, not his Book, All tho' no Scholar, he can act the Cook; And will cut Throats again, if he be paid; In th'Irish Shambles he first learn'd the Trade. Then Painter shew thy Skill, and in fit place Let's see the Nuncio Arundel's sweet Face; Let the Beholders by thy Art espy His Sense and Soul, as squinting as his Eye. Let B?sis autumnal Face be seen, Rich with the Spoils of a poor Algerine; Who trusting in him, was by him betray'd; And so shall we when his Advice's obey'd: The Heroe once got Honour by the Sword, He got his Wealth by breaking of his Word; And now his Daughter he hath got with Child, And Pimps to have his Family defil'd, Next Painter draw the Rabble of the Plot. German, Fitz Gerrald, Loftus, Porter, Scot: These are fit Heads indeed, to turn a State, And change the Order of a Nations Fate; Ten thousand such as these shall ne'r controul The smallest Atome of an English Soul. Old England on its strong Foundation stands, Defying all their Heads and all their Hands; Its steady Basis never could be shook, When Wiser Men her Ruin undertook: And can her Guardian Angel let her stoop At last, to Mad-men, Fools, and to the Pope? No Painter, no; close up this Piece and see This Crowd of Traytors, hang'd in Effigie. To the King. Great Charles, who full of Mercy, wouldst command In Peace and Pleasure this his Native Land; At last take pity of thy tottering Throne, Shook by the Faults of others, not thine own. Let not thy Life and Crown together end, Destroy'd by a false Brother and a Friend. Observe the danger that appears so near, That all your Subjects do each minute fear: One drop of Poison, or a Popish-Knife, Ends all the Joy of England with thy Life. Brothers, 'tis true, by Nature, should be kind; But a too zealous and ambitious Mind, Brib'd with a Crown on Earth, and one above, Harbours no Friendship, Tenderness, or Love: See in all Ages what Examples are Of Monarchs murther'd by their impatient Heir. Hard Fate of Princes, who will ne're believe, Till the Stroke's struck which they can ne're retrieve. Nostradamus's Prophecy. by A. Marvell. Esq;. For Faults and Follies London's Doom shall fix, And She must sink in Flames in Sixty six; Fire-Balls shall fly, but few shall see the Train, As far as from White-hall to Pudding-Lane; To burn the City, which again shall rise, Beyond all hopes, aspiring to the Skies, Where Vengeance dwells. But there is one thing more (Though its Walls stand) shall bring the City low'r: When Legislators shall their Trust betray, Saving their own, shall give the rest away; And those false men by th'easie People sent, Give Taxes to the King by Parliament: When bare-fac'd Villains shall not blush to cheat, And Chequer-Doors shall shut up Lumbard street: When Players come to act the part of Queens, Within the Curtains, and behind the Scenes: When Sodomy shall be prime Min'sters Sport, And Whoring shall be the least Crime at Court: When Boys shall take their Sisters for their Mate, And practice Incests between Seven and Eight: When no man knows in whom to put his trust, And e'en to rob the Chequer shall be just: When Declarations, Lies, and every Oath Shall be in use at Court, but Faith and Troth, When two good Kings shall be at Brentford Town, And when in London there shall be not one; When the seat's given to a talking Fool, Whom wise men laugh at, and whom Women rule; A Min'ster able only in his Tongue, To make harsh, empty speeches two hours long: When an old Scotch Covenant shall be The Champion for th'English Hierarchy: When Bishops shall lay all Religion by, And strive by Law t'establish Tyranny: When a lean Treasurer shall in one year Make himself fat, his King and People bare: When th'English Prince shall English men despise, And think French only loyal, Irish Wise: When Wooden Shoon shall be the English wear, And Magna Charta shall no more appear; Then th'English shall a greater Tyrant know, Than either Greek or Latin Story shew; Their Wives to's Lust expos'd, their Wealth to's Spoil, With Groans to fill his Treasury they toil; But like the Bellides, must sigh in vain; For that still fill'd, flows out as fast again: Then they with envious Eyes shall Belgium see, And wish in vain Venetian Liberty. The Frogs too late grown weary of their Pain, Shall pray to Jove to take him back again. Sir Edmundbury Godfrey's Ghost. It happen'd in the Twy-light of the Day, As England's Monarch in his Closet lay, And Chiffinch step'd to fetch the Female Prey; The bloody shape of Godfrey did appear, And in sad Vocal sounds these things declare: “Behold, Great Sir, I from the Shades am sent, “To shew these Wounds that did your Fall prevent. “My panting Ghost, as Envoy, comes to call, “And warn you, lest, like me, y' untimely fall; “Who against Law your Subjects Lives pursue, “By the same rute may dare to Murther you. “I, for Religion, Laws, and Liberties, “Am mangled thus, and made a Sacrifice. “Think what befel Great Egypt's hardned King, “Who scorn'd the Prophet's oft admonishing. “Shake off your brandy slumbers; for my Words “More Truth than all your close Cabal affords: “A Court you have with Luxury o'er-grown, “And all the Vices e're in Nature known; “Where Pimps and Panders in their Coaches ride, “And in Lampoons and Songs your Lust deride. “Old Bawds and slighted Whores, there tell with shame, “The dull Romance of your Lascivious Flame. “Players and Scaramouches are your Joy; “Priests and French Apes do all your Land annoy: “Still so profuse, you are insolvent grown, “A mighty Bankrupt on a Golden Throne. “Your nauseous Palate the worst Food doth crave; “No wholsom Viands can an entrance have: “Each Night you lodge in that French Syren's Arms, “She strait betrays you with her wanton Charms; “Works on your Heart, softned with Love and Wine, “And then betrays you to some Philistine. “Imperial Lust does o're your Scepter sway; “And though a Soveraign, makes you to obey. “She that from Lisbon came with such Renown, “And to inrich you with the Africk Town. “In nature mild, and gentle as a Dove; “Yet for Religion can a Serpent prove: “Priest-rid with Zeal, she Plots and did design “To cut your thred of Life, as well as mine: “Yet Thoughts so stupid have your Soul possest, “As if Inchanted by some Magick Priest: “There's no example urge you to relent, “You Pardon Guilty, punish Innocent. “Next he who 'gainst the Senate's Vote did Wed, “Took defil'd H. and Este to his Bed. “Fiend in his Face, Apostate in his Name, “Contriv'd to Wars to your eternal shame. “He ancient Laws and Liberties defies; “On standing Guards and new rais'd Force relies: “The Teagues he Courts, and doth the French admire, “And fain he would be mounted one Step higher. “All this by you must needs be plainly seen, “And yet he awes you with his daring Spleen. “Th'unhappy Kingdom suffered much of Old, “When Spencer and loose Gaveston controull'd; “Yet they by just Decrees were timely sent, “To suffer a perpetual Banishment. “But your bold States-men nothing can restrain, “Their most enormous Courses you maintain. “They like those Head-strong Horses of the Sun, “Guided by the unskilful Phaeton: “Your tott'ring Charriot bears through uncouth ways. “Till the next World's inflamed with your Rays. “Witness that Man, who had for divers years “Pay'd the Brib'd Commons, Pensions and Arrears; “Though your Exchequer was at his Command, “Durst not before his just Accusers stand: “His Crimes and Treasons of so black a hue, “None dare to prove his Advocate but you. “Who e're within your Palace Walls remain, “Abhor your actions, serve you but for Gain. “The Assyrians (as Histories relate) “Had once a King grown so Effeminate; “All State-affairs seem'd Irksome in his sight, “In Spinning Wheels he placed his whole delight. “With his lew'd Strumpet Crew he did retire, “Condemned, and Loath'd, he set himself on Fire; “And only in this Act the World did own, “The greatest Man hood of his Life was shewn. “Rome ne're to such a glorious State had grown, “Had not luxurious Tarquin there been known; “A single Rape was deem'd such a disgrace, “They extirpate his odious Name and Race; “Though he from Tuskian Kings did succour crave, “Yet they with Arms pursued him to the Grave: “Ingenious People always have withstood, “What stains their Honour or the publick good: “Trust not in Prelates false Divinity, “Who wrong their Prince, and shame their Deity, “Making their God so partial in their Cause, “Exempting Kings alone from humane Laws. “These lying Oracles they did infuse “Of old, and did your Martyr'd Sire abuse. “Their strong delusions did him so enthral, “No Cautions would anticipate his Fall. “Repent in time, and banish from your sight “The Pimp, the Whore, Buffoon, Church-parasite; “Let Innocence deck your remaining days, “That After-ages may unfold your Praise. “So may Historians in new Methods write, “And draw a Curtain 'twixt your black and white. “The Ghost spake thus, groan'd thrice, and said no more; “Stright in came Chaffinch, Hand and Hand, with Whore; “The King tho' much concern'd 'twixt Joy and Fear, “Starts from the Couch, and bid the Dame draw near. An Historical Poem by A Marvell Esq;. Of a Tall Stature, and of Sable Hue; Much like the Son of Kish, that Lofty Jew: Twelve years compleat he suffered in Exile, And kept his F?thers Asses all the while. At length by wonderful Impulse of Fate, The People call him Home to help the State; And what is more, they send him Money too, And Cloath him All, from Head to Foot, a new. Nor did he such small Favours then disdain, But in his Thirtieth year began his Reign: In a slasht Doublet then he came ashore, And dubb'd poor P?mer's Wife his Royal Wh? Bishops and Deans, Peers, Pimps, and Knights he made, Things highly fitting for a Monarch's trade; With Women, Wine, and Viands of Delight, His Jolly Vassals feast him Day and Night: But the Best Times have ever some allay, His younger Brother dy'd by Treachery. Bold James survives, no dangers make him flinch, He Marries Seignior Fal?h's pregnant Wench: The Pious Mother Queen hearing her Son Was thus Enamour'd on a Buttered Bun; And that the Fleet was gone in Pomp and State To fetch, for Charles, the Flow'ry Lisbon Kate, She Chaunts Te Deum, and so comes away, To wish her hopefull Issue timely Joy; Her most Uxurious Mate she rull'd of old; Why not with easie youngsters make as Bold? From the French Court she haughty Topicks brings, Deludes their Plyant Nature with vain things; Her mischief-breeding Breast did so prevaile, The new got Flemish 'Town was set to sail; For these and Germains Sins she Founds a Church, So slips away, and leaves us in the Lurch. Now the Court-Sins did every place defile, And Plagues, and War, fell heavy on the Isle. Pride nourisht Folly, Folly a Delight With the Batavian Common-wealth to fight: But the Dutch Fleet fled suddenly with Fear, Death and the Duke so dreadful did appear. The dreadful Victor took his soft Repose, Scorning pursuit of such Mecannick Foes. But now Y?k's Genitals grew over-hot, With D???ham and Carneige's infected Plot; Which, with Religion, so inflam'd his Ire, He left the City when 'twas got on Fire: So Philip's Son, inflamed with a Miss, Burnt down the Palace of Persepolis. Foild thus by Venus, he Bellona wooe's, And with the Dutch a second War renews. But here his French bred Prowess prov'd in vain, De Ruyter claps him in Sole Bay again. This Isle was well reform'd, and gain'd Renown, Whilst the brave Tudor's wore th'Imperial Crown: But since the Royall Race of St???s came, It has recoyl'd to Popery, and Shame. Misguided Monarchs, rarely Wise or Just; Tainted with Pride, and with impetuous Lust. Should we the Black Heath Project here relate, Or count the various Blemishes of State, My Muse would on the Reader's Patience grate. The poor Priapus King led by the Nose Looks as a thing set up to scare the Crows; Yet in the Mimicks of the Spinstrian sport, Out does Tiberius, and his Goatish Court. In Love's Delights none did him e'er excel, Not Tereus with his Sister Philomel. As they at Athens, we at Dover meet, And gentlier far the Orleans Dutchess treat. What sad Event attended on the same, We'll leave to the Report of Common Fame. The Senate, which should head-strong Princes stay, Let loose the Reins, and give the Realm away; With lavish hands they constant Tributes give, And Annual Stipends for their Guilt receive; Corrupt with Gold, they Wives and Daughters bring To the Black Idol for an Offering. All but Religious Cheats might justly swear, He true Vice-gerent to old Molock were. Priests were the first Deluders of Mankind, Who with vain Faith made all their Reason blind; Not Lucifer himself more proud than they, And yet preswade the World they must obey; 'Gainst Avarice and Luxury complain, And practice all the Vices they arraign. Riches and Honour thy from Lay-men reap, And with dull Crambo feed the silly Sheep. As Killigrew Buffoons his Master, they Droll on their God, but a much duller way; With Hocus Pocus, and their Heavenly slight They gain on tender Consciences at Night. Who ever has an over-zealous Wife, Becomes the Priests Amphitrio, during life. Who would such Men Heavens Messengers believe, Who from the Sacred Pulpit dare deceive. Baal's wretched Curates Legerdemain'd it so, And never durst their Tricks above-board shew, When our first Parents Paradise did grace, The Serpent was the Prelate of the place; Fond Eve did for this subtil Tempter's sake, From the Forbidden Tree the Pippin take. His God and Lord this Preacher did betray, To have the weaker Vessel made his Prey. Since Death and Sin did humane Nature blot, The chiefest Blessings Adam's Chaplain got. Thrice wretched they, who Nature's Laws detest, And trace the ways fantastick of a Priest; Till native Reasons basely forc'd to yield, And Hosts of upstart Errors gains the Field. My Muse presum'd a little to disgress, And touch her holy Function with my Verse. Now to the State again she tends direct, And does on Giant L???dale reflect. This haughty Monster, with his ugly Claws, First temper'd Poyson to destroy our Laws; Declares the Councils, Edicts are beyond The most Authentick Statutes of the Land: Sets up in Scotland A-la-mode de France; Taxes, Excise, and Armies does advance. This Saracen his Country's Freedom broke, To bring upon our Necks the heavier Yoke: This is the Savage Pimp, without dispute, First brought his Mother for a Prostitute. Of all the Miscreants that e're went to Hell, This Villain-Rampant beares away the Bell. Now must my Muse deplore the Nation's Fate, Like a true Lover, for her dying Mate. The Royal Evil so malignant grows, Nothing the dire Contagion can oppose. In our Weal-publick scarce one thing succeeds, For one Man's weakness a whole Nation bleeds, Ill-luck starts up, and thrives like evil weeds. Let Cromwell's Ghost smile with contempt to see Old England strugling under Slavery. His Meager Highness now has got a stride, Does on Britannia, as on Churchil ride. White-liver'd D? for his swift Jack-call. To hunt down's Prey, and hopes to Master all. Clifford and Hide before had lost the Day; One hang'd himself, and the other ran away; 'Twas want of Wit and Courage made them fail, But O???ne and the D???ke must needs prevail. The D???ke now vaunts with Popish Mermydons, Our Fleets, our Ports, our Cities, and our Towns, Are Man'd by him, or by his Holiness, Bold Irish Ruffians to his Court Address: This is the Collony to plant his Knaves, From hence he picks and culls his Murthering Braves. Here for an Ensign, or Lieutenant's place, They'll kill a Judge or Justice of the Peace. At his Command Mac will do any thing; He'll burn a City: or destroy a King. From Tiber came th'Advice-Boat monthly home, And brought new Lessons to the Duke from Rome. Here with curs'd Precepts, and with Councils dire, The godly Cheat-King (would be) did inspire; Heaven had him Chieftain of Great Britain made; Tells him the Holy Church demands his Aid, Bad him be bold, all Dangers to defy, His Brother, sneaking Heretick, should dye: A Priest should do it, from whose sacred stroke All England straight should fall beneath his Yoke. God did Renounce him, and his Cause disown, And in his stead had plac'd him on his Throne. From Saul the Land of Promise thus was rent, And Jess's Son plac'd in the Goverment: The Holy Scripture vindicates his Cause, And Monarchs are above all humane Laws. Thus said the Scarlet Whore to her Gallant, Who streight design'd his Brother to supplant: Fiends of Ambition here his Soul possest, And Thirst of Empire Calentur'd his Breast. Hence Ruine and Destruction had ensu'd, And all the People bin in Blood imbru'd, Had not Almighty Providence drawn near, And stopt his Malice in its full career. Be wise you Sons of Men, tempt God no more, To give you Kings in's wrath to vex you sore: If a King's Brother can such Mischiefs bring, Then how much greater Mischiefs such a King? Hodges Vision, from the Monument. Decem. 1675, By A. Marvell Esq; A Country Clown call'd Hodge, went up to view The Pyramid; pray mark what did ensue. When Hodge had numbered up how many score The Airy Pyramid contain'd, he swore, No Mortal Wight e're Climb'd so high before: To the best vantage plac'd he views around The Imperial Town, with lofty Turrets Crown'd; That wealthy Store-house of the bounteous Flood, Whose Peaceful Tides o'reflow our Land with good: Confused forms flit by his wondring Eyes, And his rapt Souls o'rewhelm'd with Extasies: Some God it seems had enter'd his plain Breast, And with's abode the rustick Mansion blest; Almighty change he feels in every part, Light shines in's Eyes, and Wisdom rules his Heart: So when her Pious Son, fair Venus shew'd His flaming Troy, with Slaughter'd Dardans strew'd; She Purg'd his Opticks, fill'd with mortal Night, And Troy's sad Doom he read, by Heaven's light, Such light Divine broke on the Clouded Eyes Of humble Hodge. Regions remote, Courts, Councils, Pollicies, The circling wills of Tyrants treacheries: He Views, Discerns, Uncyphers, Penetrates, From Charles's Dukes, to Europes armed States; First he beholds Proud Rome and France Combin'd, By double Vassallage to enslave Man-kind; That wou'd the Soul, this wou'd the Body sway, Their Bulls and Edicts, none must dis-obey. For these with War sad Europe they inflame, Rome says for God, and France declares for Fame: See Sons of Satan know Religions force, Is Gentleness, Fame bought with Blood a Curse, He whom all still'd Delight of human kind, Justice and Mercy, Truth with Honour joyn'd: His kindly Rays cherish the teeming Earth, And struggling Virtue blest with prosperous Birth; Like Chaos you the tott'ring Globe Invade, Religion cheat, and War ye make a Trade. Next the lewd Palace of the Plotting King, To's Eyes new Scenes of Frantick Folly bring; Behold (says he) the Fountain of our Woe, From whence our Vices and our Ruin flow: Here Parents their own Of-spring prostitute, By such vile Arts t'obtain some viler Suit; Here blooming Youth adore Priapus's shrine, And Priests pronounce him Sacred and Divine. The Gotish God behold in his Alcove, (The secret Scene of Damn'd incestuous Love.) Melting in Lust, and Drunk like Lot, he lies Betwixt two bright Daughter Divinities: Oh! that like Saturn he had eat his Brood, And had been thus stain'd with their impious Blood, He had in that less ill, more Man-hood shew'd. Cease, cease, (O C?) thus to pollute our Isle, Return, return to thy long wish'd Exile; There with thy Court defile thy Neighbour States, And with thy Crimes precipitate their fates. See where the Duke in damn'd Divan does sit, To's vast designs wracking his Pigmy Wit, Whilst a choice Senate of the Ignatian Crew, The waies to Murder, Treason, Conquest shew; Dissenters they oppress with Laws severe, That whilst to Wound those Innocents, we fear, Their cursed Sect we may be forc'd to spare. Twice the Reform'd must fight a Bloody Prize, That Rome and France may on their ruin rise: Old Bonner, single Hereticks did burn, These Reform'd Cities into Ashes turn, And every year new Fires make us Mourn: Ireland stands ready for his Cruel Reign, Well fatned once, she gapes for Blood again, For Blood of English Martyrs basely Slain. Our Valiant Youth abroad must learn the Trade Of unjust War, their Country to Invade, Whilst others here do Guard us to prepare Our Gaulded Necks, his Iron Yoke to bear. Lo how the Wight already is betray'd, And Bashaw Holmes, does the poor Isle invade: T'ensure the Plot, France must her Legions lend Rome to restore, and to Enthrone Romes Friend: 'Tis in return, James does our Fleet betray; (That Fleet whose Thunder made the World obey;) Ships once our safety, and our glorious might, Are doom'd with Worms and rottenness to fight; Whilest France rides Soveraign o're the British Main, Our Merchants robb'd, and our brave Seamen ta'ne: Thus this rash Phaeton with fury hurl'd, And rapid rage consumes our British World; Blast him, Oh Heavens! in his mad Career, And let this Isle no more his Frency fear. C? J?, 'tis he that all good Men abhor, False to thy self, but to thy Friend much more; To him who did thy promis' Pardon hope, Coleman. Whilst with pretended Joy he kiss'd the Rope: O'rewhelm'd with Guilt, and gasping out a Lye, Deceiv'd and unprepar'd, thou lets him Dye, Whith equal Gratitude and Charity In spight of Jermin, and of Black-mouth'd Fame; This St???s trick Legitimates thy Name. With one consent we all her Death desire, Who durst her Husbands and her Kings Conspire; And now just Heavens prepar'd to set us free, Heaven and our hopes, are both oppos'd by thee: Thus fondly thou do'st Hides old Treason own, Thus makes thy new suspected Treason known. Bless me What's that at Westminster I see? That peice of Legislative Pageantry? To our dear James, has Rome her Conclave lent? Or has Charles bought the Paris Parliament: None else wou'd promote James with so much Zeal; Who by Proviso hopes the Crown to Steal: See how in humble guise the Slaves advance, To tell a tale of Army, and of France; Whilst proud Prerogative in's scornful Guise Their fear, Love, Duty, danger does despise; There in a brib'd Committee they contrive, To give our Birth-right's to Prerogative: Give, did I say? They sell, and sell so dear, That half each Tax D? distributes there D?, 'tis fit the price so great shou'd be, They sell Religion, sell their Liberty; These Vipers have their Mothers Entrals torn, And wou'd by force a second time be born; They haunt the place to which you once were sent, This Ghost of a departed Parliament. Octob. the 15th 76. Gibbets and Halters Country Men prepare, Let none, let none, their Renegadoes spare: When that day comes we'll part the Sheep and Goats, The spruce brib'd Monsieurs from the true Grey Coats, New Parliaments like Manna, all tasts please, But kept too long our Food, turns our Disease; From that loath'd sight, Hodge turn'd his weeping Eyes And London thus Alarms with Loyal cries. Tho' common danger does approach so nigh, This Stupid Town sleeps in security: Out of your Golden Dream awake, awake, Your all, your all, tho' you see 't not's at stake, More dreadful Fires approach your falling Town, Then those which burnt your stately Structures down. Such fatal Fires, as once in Smith-field shone. If then ye stay till Edward's Orders give, Major No mortal Arme your safety can retrieve; See how with Golden baits the crafty Gaul Has brib'd our Geese to yield the Capital; And will ye tamely see your selves betray'd; Will none stand up in our dear Country's aid? Self-preservation, Natures first great Law, All the Creation, except Man, does awe, 'Twas in him fix'd, till lying Priests defac'd His Heav'n born Mind, and Natures Tablets raz'd. Tell me (ye forging Crew) what Law reveal'd By God, to Kings the Jus Divinum seal'd? If to do good, ye Jus Divinum call, It is the grand Prerogative of all: If to do Ill unpunished be their Right, Such Power's not granted that great King of night; Man's life moves on the Poles of hope and fear, Reward and pain all Orders do revear. But if your dear Lord Sov'raigne you would spare, Admonish him in his Blood-thirsty Heir: So when the Royal Lyon does offend, The beaten Currs example makes him mend: This said poor Hodge, then in a broken tone, Cry'd out, Oh Charles! thy Life, thy Life, thy Crown; Ambitious James, and Bloody Priests Conspire, Plots, Papists, Murders, Massacres, and Fire; Poor Protestants! With that his Eyes did rowl; His Body fell, out fled his frighted Soul. A Dialogue Between two Horses. The attribution of this poem is questionable. by A. Marvell, Esq; 1674. The Introduction. We read in profane and sacred Records Of Beasts, that have utter'd Articulate Words; When Magpies and Parrots cry, Walk, Knaves, walk, It is a clear Proof that Birds too may talk. And Statues without either Wind-pipes or Lungs Have spoken as plainly as Men do with Tongues: Livy tells a strange Story, can hardly be fellowed, That a sacrific'd Ox when his Guts were out, bellow'd. Phalaris had a Bull, which as grave Authors tell you, Would roar like a Devil with a Man in his Belly. Friar Bacon had a Head that spake, made of Brass; And Balaam the Prophet was reprov'd by his Ass. At Delphos and Rome, Stocks and Stones, now and then, Sirs, Have to Questions return'd Articulate Answers. All Popish Believers think something Divine, When Images speak, possesseth the Shrine: But they that Faith Catholick ne'er understood, When Shrines give Answer, a Knaves on the Rood. Those Idols ne'er spoke, but are Miracles done By the Devil, a Priest, a Friar or a Nun. If the Roman Church, good Christians, oblige ye To believe Man and Beast have spoke in Effigie. Why should we not credit the publick Discourses In a Dialogue between two Inanimate Horses? The Horses, I mean, of Wool Church and Charing, Who told many Truths worth any Man's Hearing, Since Viner and Osborne did buy, and provide 'em, For the two Mighty Monarchs that now do bestride 'em. The stately brass Stallion, and the white marble Steed, One Night came together by all 'tis agreed: When both Kings being weary of Sitting all Day, Were stollen off Incognito each his own way. And then the two Jades, after mutual Salutes, Not only discours'd, but fell to Disputes. The Dialogue. VV. Quoth the Marble Horse, it would make a Stone speak To see a Lord Mayor and a Lumbard street break: Thy Founder and mine to cheat one another, When both Knaves agreed to be each others Brother. C. Here Charing broke forth, and thus he went on, My Brass is provoked as much as thy Stone, To see Church and State bow down to a Whore, And the Kings chief Minister holding the Door. The Mony of Widdows and Orphans imploy'd, And the Bankers quire broke to maintain the Whores Pride. W. To see Dei Gratia writ on the Throne, And the K?'s wicked Life say, God there is none. C. That he should be stil'd Defender of the Faith, Who believes not a Word, what the Word of God saith, W. That the D? should turn Papist, and that Church defie, For which his own Father a Martyr did dye. C. Tho' he changed his Religion, I hope he's so civil Not to think his own Father is gone to the Devil. W. That bondage and beggary should be in a Nation, By a Curst House of Commons, and a blest Restoration: C. To see a white Staff make a Beggar a Lord, And scarce a wisé Man at a long Council-board. W. That the Bank should be seized, yet the Cheq. so poor, Lord have Mercy, and a Cross might be set on the door: C. That a Million and half should be the Revenue, Yet the King of his Debts pay no Man a Penny. W. That a K? should consume three Kingdom's Estates, And yet all the Court be as poor as Church Rats. C. That of four Seas Dominion and of there guarding, No token should appear, but a poor Copper farthing. W. Our Worm-eaten Ships to be laid up at Chatham, (Not our Trade to secure,) but for Fools to come at 'em. C. And our few Ships abroad become Tripoli's scorn, By pawning for Victuals their Guns at Leghorn. VV. That making us Slaves by Horse and Foot Guard, For restoring the King shall be all our reward. C. The basest Ingratitude ever was heard, But Tyrants ungrateful are always afraid. W. On Harry the Seventh's Head, he that placed the Crown, Was after Rewarded by losing his own. C. That Parliament-men should rail at the Court, And get good Preferments immediatly for't. To see them that suffer both for Father and Son, And helped to bring the latter to his Throne: That with their Lives and Estates did Loyally serve, And yet for all this, can nothing deserve; The King looks not on 'em, Preferments deni'd 'em, The Round heads insult, and the Courtiers deride them. And none gets Preferments, but who will betray Their Country to Ruin, 'tis that ope's the way Of the bold talking Members.— W. —If the Bastards you add, What a number of Rascally Lords have been made. C. That Traitors to their Country in a brib'd House of C. Should give away Millions at every Summons. W. Yet some of those Givers, such beggarly Villains, As not to be trusted for twice-fifty Shillings. C. No wonder that Beggars should still be for giving, Who out of what's given, do get a good living. W. Four Knights and a Knave, who were Burg esses made, For selling their Consciences were liberally paid. C. How base are the Souls of such low prized Sinners, Who Vote with the Country for drink and for dinners, W. 'Tis they that brought on us this Scandalous Yoke, Of Excising our Cups, and Taxing our Smoak. C. But thanks to the Whores who made the K? dogged, For giving no more the R? are Prorogued. W. That a King should endeavour to make a War cease, Which augments and secures his own profit and peace. C. And Plenipotentiaries send into France, With an addle headed Knight, &amp; a Lord without Brains. VV. That the King should send for another French Whore, When one already had made him so Poor. C. The Misses take place, and advanc'd to be Dutchess, With Pomp great as Queens in there Coach and six Horses: Their Bastards made Dukes, Earls, Viscounts &amp; Lords, And all the high Titles that Honour affords. VV. While these Brats and their Mothers, do live in such Plenty The Nation's empoverisht, and the Chequor quite empty: And tho' War was pretended when the Mony was lent, More on Whores, then in Ships, or in War, hath been spent. C. Enough, dear Brother, although we speak Reason; Yet truth many times being punish'd for Treason, We ought to be wary, and bridle our Tongues, Bold speaking hath done both Men and Beasts wrong: When the Ass so boldly rebuked the Prophet, Thou knowest what danger was like to come of it; Though the Beast gave his Master ne'er an ill Word, Instead of a Cudgel Balaam wish'd for a Sword. VV. Truth's as bold as a Lion, I am not afraid, I'll prove every tittle of what I have said: Our Riders are absent, who is't that can hear; Lets be true to our selves, who then need we fear? Where is thy K? gone, (Chair.) to see Bishop Laud? VV. To Cuckold a Scrivener, mines in Masquerade? On such Occasions he oft strays away, And returns to remount about break of Day. In very dark Nights sometimes you may find him With a Harlot, got up on my Crupper behind him. C. Pause Brother a while, and calmly consider What thou hast to say against my Royal Rider. VV. Thy Priest-ridden King turn'd desperate fighter For the Surplice, Lawn sleeves, the Cross and the Miter Till at last on the Scaffold he was left in the lurch By Knaves, that cry'd up themselves for the Church. Arch-Bishops and Bishops, Arch-Deacons and Deans; C. Thy King will ne'er fight unless't be for Queans. VV. He that dies for Ceremonies, dies like a Fool. C. The K? on thy Back is a lamentable tool. VV. The Goat and the Lion, I equally hate, And Freeman alike value Life and a Estate: Though the Father and Son be different rods, Between the two Scourges we find little odds; Both Infamous stand in three Kingdoms Votes, This for Picking our Pockets, that for cutting our Throats: C. More tolerable are the Lion Kings Slaughters Then the Goat making Whores of our Wives and Daughters: The Debauched and Cruel since they equally gall us, I had rather bear Nero than Sardanapalus. VV. One of the two Tyrants must still be our Case, Under all that shall Reign of the false S? Race. W. De Wit and Cromwel had each a brave Soul, I freely declare it, I am for old Nol; Though his Government did a Tyrant resemble, He made England great and his Enemies tremble, C. Thy Rider puts no Man to Death in his Wrath, But is bury'd a live in Lust and in Sloth. W. What is thy Opinion of James Duke of York C. The same that the Frogs had of Jupiter's Stork. With the Turk in his Head, and the Pope in his Heart, Father Patrick's Disciples will make England smart. If e'er he be King I know Britain's Doom, We must all to a Stake, or be Converts to Rome. Ah! Tudor, ah! Tudor, we have had Ste?s enough: None ever reign'd like old Bess in the Ruff. Her Walsingham could dark Counsels unriddle, And our Sir J?ph write News books and fiddle, W. Truth, Brother, well said, but that's somewhat bitter, His perfumed Predecessor was never more fitter: Yet we have one Secretary honest and wise; For that very Reason, he's never to rise. But can'st thou devise when things will be mended? C. When the Reign of the Line of the S?ts, are ended. Conclusion. If Speeches from Animals in Rome's first Age, Prodigious Events did surely presage, That should come to pass, all Mankind may swear That which two Inanimate Horses declare. But I should have told you before the Jades parted, Both gallop'd to VVhite hall, and there humbly farted; Which Tyranny's downfal portended much more Than all that the Beasts had spoken before. If the Delphick Sybil's Oracular Speeches, (As learned Men say) came out of their Breeches, Why might not our Horses, since Words are but Wind, Have the Spirit of Prophecy likewise behind? Though Tyrants make Laws, which they strictly proclaim To conceal their own Faults, and cover their own Shame; Yet the Beasts in the Field, and the Stones in the Wall, Will publish their Faults and prophesy their Fall; When they take from the People the Freedom of Words, They teach them the sooner to fall to their Swords. Let the City drink Coffee, and quietly groan, (They that conquer'd the Father won't be Slaves to the Son, For Wine and strong Drink make Tumults encrease, Chocolate, Tea, and Coffee, are Liquors of Peace; No Quarrels or Oaths amongst those that drink them, 'Tis Bacchus, and the Brewer swear dam em and sink 'em. Then C???s thy late Edict against Coffee recal, There's ten times more Treason in Brandy and Ale. On the Lord Mayor and Court of Alderman, presenting the late King and Duke of York each with a Copy of their Freedoms, Anno Dom. 1674. By A. Marvell. Esq;. I The Londoners Gent to the King do present In a Box the City Maggot; 'Tis a thing full of weight, that requires the Might, Of whole Guild Hall Team to drag it. II Whilst their Church's unbuilt, and their Houses undwelt, And their Orphans want Bread to feed 'em; Themselves they've bereft of the little Wealth they had left, To make an Offering of their Freedom. III O'ye Addle-brain'd Cits! who henceforth in their Wits Would intrust their Youth to your heading; When in Diamonds and Gold you have him thus enroll'd, You know both his Friends and his Breeding? IV Beyond Sea he began, where such a Riot he ran, That every one there did leave him; And now he's come o'er ten times worse than before, When none but such Fools would receive him. V He ne'er knew, not he, how to serve or be free, Though he has past through so many Adventures; But e'er since he was bound, (that is he was crown'd) He has every Day broke his Indentures. VI He spends all his Days in running to Plays, When he should in the Shop be poring: And he wasts all his Nights in his constant Delights, Of Revelling, Drinking and Whoring. VII Thro out Lumbard street each Man he did meet, He would run on the Score and borrow, When they'd ask'd for their own, he was broke and gone, And his Creditors left to Sorrow. VIII Though oft bound to the Peace, yet he never would cease, To vex his poor Neighbours with Quarrels, And when he was beat, he still made his Retreat, To his Cleavelands, his Nels, and his Carwels. IX Nay, his Company lewd, were twice grown so rude, That had not Fear taught him Sobriety, And the House been well barr'd with Guard upon Guard, They'd robb'd us of all our Propriety. X Such a Plot was laid, had not' Ashley betray'd, As had cancell'd all former Disasters; And your Wives had been Strumpers to his Highnesses Trumpets, And Foot Boys had all been your Masters. XI So many are the Debts, and the Bastards he gets, Which must all be defray'd by London, That notwithstanding the Care of Sir Thomas Player, The Chamber must needs be undone. XII His Word nor his Oath cannot bind him to Troth, And he values not Credit or History; And though he has serv'd through two Prentiships now, He knows not his Trade nor his Mystery. XIII Then London rejoyce in thy fortunate Choice, To have made him free of thy Spices; And do not mistrust he may once grow more just, When he's worn of his Follies and Vices. XIV And what little thing is that which you bring To the Duke, the Kingdom's Darling; Ye hug it and draw like Ants at a Straw, Tho' too small for the Gristle of Starling. XV Is it a Box of Pills to cure the Duke's Ills? (He is too far gone to begin it) Or that your fine Show in Processioning go, With the Pix and the Host within it. XVI The very first Head of the Oath you him read, Shews you all how fit he's to Govern, When in Heart (you all knew) he ne'er was nor will be true To his Country or to his Soveraign. XVII And who could swear, that he would forbear To cull out the good of an Alien, Who still doth advance the Government of France, With a VVife and Religion Italian? XVIII And now, Worshipfull Sirs, go fold up your Furrs, And Vyner turn again, turn again; I see who e'ers freed you for Slaves are decreed Until you burn again, burn again. On Blood's Stealing the Crown. By A. Marvell, Esq;. When daring Blood, his Rent to have regain'd Upon the English Diadem distrain'd: He chose the Cassock, Sursingle and Gown, The fittest Mask for one that robs the Crown; But his lay pitty underneath prevail'd, And whilst he sav'd the Keepers Life he fail'd. With the Priests Vestment had he but put on. The Prelates Cruelty, the Crown had gone. A. Marvell. Farther Instructions to a Painter, 1670. By A. Marvell Esq;. Painter, once more thy Pencil re assume, And darw me in one Scene London and Rome: Here holy Charles, there good Aurelius sat, Weeping to see their Sons Degenerate: His Romans taking up the Teemers Trade, The Britains Jigging it in Masquerade; Whilst the brave Youths tired with the Toil of State, Their wearied Minds, and Limbs to recreat; Do to their more belov'd Delights repair, One to his ?, the other to his Player. Then change the Scene, and let the next present A Landskip of our Motley Parliament; And place hard by the Barr, on the Left-hand, Circean Clifford with his Charming Wand: Our Pig-ey'd on his Fashion, Set by the worst Attorney of our Nation: This great Triumirate that can divide The spoils of England, and along that side Place Falstafs Regiment of thred bear Coats, All looking this way, how to give their Votes, And of his dear Reward let none Dispair. For Mony comes when Sey?r leaves the Chair: Change once again, and let the next afford The Figure of a Motley Council Board. At Arlingtons, and round about it sat, Our mighty Masters in a warm debate: Full Bowls, and lustly Wine repeat, To make them t'other Council board forget: That while the King of France with powerful Arms, Gives all his fearful Neighbours strange Allarms; Wee in our glorious Bachanalls dispose The humbled Fate of a Plebean Nose. Which to effect, when thus it was Decreed; Draw me a Champion mounted on a Steed, And after him a brave Briggade of Horse, Arm'd at all Points, ready to reinforce, His, this assault upon a single Man. 'Tis this must make Obryon great in Story, And add more beams to Sandys former Glory. Draw our Olympia, next in Council set, With Cupid, S?r, and the tool of State. Two of the first recanters of the House, That Aim at Mountains, and bring forth a Mouse; Who make it by there mean retreat appear, Five Members need not be demanded here: These must assist her in her Countermines, To overthrow the Darby House Designs. Whilst positive Walks, like Woodcock in the Park, Contriving Projects with a Brewers Clark; Thus all Employ themselves, and without Pity, Leave Temple singly to be beat i'th' City. A. Marvell. Oceana. &amp; Britannia. By. A. Marvell Esq; Non ego sum vates, sed prisci Conscius ævi. Oceana. Whither, O whither wander I forlorn? Fatal to Friends, and to my Foes a scorn. My pregnant Womb is labouring to bring forth Thy Off spring Archon, Heir to thy just worth. Archon, O Archon, hear my groaning Cries; Lucina, help, asswage my Miseries. Saturnian spight pursues me thro' the Earth, No corner's left to hide my long wisht Birth. Great Queen of the Isles, yield me a safe retreat From the crown'd Gods, that would my Infants eat. To me O Delos on my Child-Bed smile, My happy Seed shall fix thy floating Isle. I feel fierce pangs assault my Teeming Womb, Lucina, O Britannia, Mother, come. Britan. What doleful shrieks pierce my affrighted Ear Shall I ne'r rest for this lewd Ravisher? Rapes, Burnings, Murthers are his Royal Sport, These Modish Monsters haunt his perjur'd Court. No tumbling Player so oft e're chang'd his shape, As this Goat, Fox, Wolf, timerous French Ape. True Protestants in Roman Habits drest, With Scrogs he baits that Ravenous Butchers Beast. Tresilian J??s, that fair-fac'd Crocodile, Tearing their Hearts, at once doth weep and smile, Neronian Flames at London do him please, At Oxford Plots to Act Agathocles. His Plot's reveal'd, his Mirth is at an end, And's fatal hour shall know no Foe nor Friend. Last Martyr's day I saw a Cherub stand A cross my Seas, one Foot upon the Land, The' other on the enthralled Gallick Shore, Aloud Proclaim their Time shall be no more. This mighty Power Heav'ns equal Ballance sway'd, And in one Scale Crowns, Crosiers, Scepters laid, I'th' other a sweet smiling Babe did lye, Circled with Glories, deck'd with Majesty. With steddy Hand he pois'd the Golden pair, The gilded Gew-gaws mounted in the Air, The ponderous Babe descending in its Scale, Leapt on my Shore— Nature triumph'd, Joy eccho'd throw the Earth, The Heav'ns bow'd down to see the blessed Birth. What's that I hear? A new born Babes soft Cries, And joyful Mother's tender Lullabies! 'Tis so, behold my Daughter's past all harms, Cradeling an Infant in her fruitful Arms. The very same th'Angelique Vision shew'd In mein, in Majesty how like a God. What a firm Health does on her Visage dwell? Her sparkling Eyes Immortal Youth fore-tel. Rome, Sparta, Venice, never could bring forth So strong, so temperate, such lasting worth. Marpesia from the North with speed advance, Thy Sisters Birth brings thy Deliverance. Fergusian Founders this just Babe exceeds I'th' Arts of Peace and mighty Martial deeds. Ye Panopeians kneel unto your equal Queen, Safe from the Foreign Sword, and Barbarous Skeen. Transports of Joy divert my yearning Heart From my dear Child, my Soul, my better part. Hev'n show'r her choicest Blessings on thy womb, Our present help, our stay in time to come. Thou best of Daughters, Mothers, Matrons say, What forc'd thy Birth, and got this glorious Day? Ocea. Scap'd the slow Jaws o'th' grinding Pensioners, I fell i'th' Traps of Rome's dire Murtherers; Twice rescu'd by my Loyal Senate's Power. Twice I expected my Babe's happy Hour. Malignant force twice check'd their Pious aid, And to my Foes as oft my State betray'd. Great, full of pain, in a dark Winters Night, Threatned, pursu'd, I escap'd by sudden flight. Pale fear gave speed to my weak'trembling Feet, And far I fled e're Day our World could greet. That dear-lov'd Light which the whole Globe doth chear, Spur'd on my flight, and added to my fear, Whilst black Conspiracy, that Child of Night, In Royal Purple clad, out-dares the Light. By Day her self the Faith's Defender stiles, By Night dig Pits, and spreads her Papal Toils By Day he to the Pompous Chappel goes, By Night with York adores Rome's Idol-shews: Witness ye Stars and silent Powers of Night, Her Treacheries forc'd my Innocent flight. With the broad Day my danger too drew near, Of help, of Council void, how shall I steer? I'th' Pulpit damn'd, Strumpet at Court proclaim'd, Where should I hide, where should I rest defam'd? Tortur'd in thought, I rais'd my weeping Eyes, And sobbing Voice to th'all helping Skies; As by Heav'n sent a Reverend Sire appears, Charming my Grief, and stopping my flood of Tears. His busie circling Orbs (two restless Spies) Glanc'd to and fro, out-ranging Argos Eyes. Like fleeting Time, on's Front one lock did grow, From his glib Tongue torrents of words did flow Propose, Resolve, Agrarian Forty one, Lycurgus, Brutus, Solon, Harington. He said, he knew me in my Swadling bands, Had often danc'd me in his careful Hands. He knew Lord Archon too, then wept and swore, Enshrin'd in me, his Fame he did adore. His Name I ask'd, he said, Politico, Descended from the Divine Nicholo. My state he knew, my danger seem'd to dread, And to my safety vow'd, Hand, Heart, Head. Grateful Returns I up to Heaven send, That in Distress had sent me such a Friend. I ask'd him where I was? Pointing, he shew'd Oxford's Old Towers, once the Learned Arts aboad. (Once great in Fame, now a Piratick Port, Where Romish Priests and Elvish Monks resort) He added near a new-built College stood, Endow'd by Plato for the Publick good. Thither allur'd by Learned Honest Men, Plato vouchsaf'd once more to live again. Securely there I might my self repose, From my fierce Griefs and my more cruel Foes. Tyr'd with long flights, e'en hunted down with fear, The welcome News my drooping Soul did chear. His pleasing words shortned the time and way, And me beguil'd at Plato's House to stay. When we came in, be told me (after rest,) He'd shew me Plato and's Venetian Guest, I scarce reply'd, with weariness opprest. To my desir'd Apartment I repair'd, Invoking Sleep and Heaven's Almighty Guard. My waking Cares and stabbing frights recede, And nodding Sleep dropt on my drowsie Head. At last the Summons of a busie Bell, And glimmering Lights did Sleeps kind Mists dispel. From Bed I stole, and creeping by the Wall, Thro' a small Chink I spy'd a Spacious Hall. Tapers as thick as Stars did shed their Light Around the place, and made a Day of Night. The curious Art of some great Master's hand, Adorn'd the Room—Hide, Clifford, D? stand In one large piece, next them the two Dutch Wars, In bloody Colours paint our fatal Jars. Here London Flames in Clouds of smoke aspire, Done to the life, I'd almost cry'd out Fire. But living Figures did my Eyes divert From those, and many more of wondrous Art. There entred in three Mercenary Bands. (The different Captains had distinct Commands) The Begger's desperate Troop did first appear, L?ton led, proud S?re had the Rear. The disguis'd Papists under Garroway, Talbot Lieutenant (none had better pay) Next greedy Lee led Party-colour'd Slaves, Deaf Fools i'th' right, i'th' wrong sagacious Knaves. Brought up by M?, then a Nobler Train, (In Malice mighty, impotent in Brain) The Pope's Solicitor brought into th'Hall, Not guilty Lay much guilty Spiritual. I also spy'd behind a private Skreen, Colebert and Portsmouth, York and Mazarine. Immediately in close Cabal they joyn, And all applaud the Glorious Design. 'Gainst me and my lov'd Senates Free born Breath, Dire threats I hear'd, the Hall did Eccho Death. A Curtain drawn, another Scene appear'd, A tinckling Bell, a mumbling Priest I heard. At Elevation every Knee ador'd The Baker's Craft, Infallible's vain Lord. When Cataline with Vipers did conspire, To Murther Rome and bury it in Fire, A Sacramental Bowl of Humane Goar, Each Villain took, and as he drank he swore. The Cup deny'd, to make their Plot compleat, These Catalines their conjur'd Gods did eat. Whilst to their Breaden Whimseys they did kneel, I crept away, and to the door did steal. As I got out, by Providence I flew, To this close Wood, too late they did pursue. That dreadful night, my Child-Bed Throws brought on, My Crys mov'd yours and Heavens Compassion. Britania. Oh happy day! A Jubilee Proclaim, Daughter adore the unutterable name. With grateful Heart breath out thy self in Prayer. In the mean time thy Babe shall be my care. There is a man my Island's Hope and Grace, The chief Delight and Joy of humane Race. Expos'd himself to War, in tender Age, To free his Country from the Gallick Rage, VVith all the Graces blest his riper Years, And full blown Vertue wak'd the Tyrant's fears. By's Sire rejected, but by Heaven call'd, To break my Yoke, and rescue the Enthral'd. This this is he who with a stretch'd out Hand, And matchless might shall free my groaning Land. On Earth's proud Basilisks he'll justly fall, Like Moses Rod, and Prey upon them all. He'll guide my People through the Raging Seas, To Holy Wars and certain Victories. His spotless Fame, and his Immense Desert, Shall plead Loves cause, and storm this Virgins Heart. She like Ægeria shall his Breast inspire, With Justice, Wisdom, and Celestial Fire. Like Numa be her Dictates shall obey, And by her Oracles the World shall sway. On his Excellent Friend Mr. Anth. Marvell, 1677. While lazy Prelates lean'd their Mitred Heads On downy Pillows, lull'd with Wealth and Pride, (Pretending Prophesie, yet naught foresee.) Marvell, this Islands watchful Centinel stood in the gap, and bravely kept his Post, When Courtiers too in Wine and Riot slept: 'Twas he th'approach of Rome did first explore, And the grim Monster, Arbitrary Power. The ugliest Giant ever trod the Earth, Who like Goliah marcht before the Host: Truth, Wit and Eloquence, his Constant Friends, With swift dispatch he to the Main-Guard sends, Th'Alarm strait their Courage did Excite, Which check'd the Haughty Foes bold Enterprize, And left them halting between Hope and Fear; He like the Sacred Hebrew Leader stood. The Peoples surest Guide, and Prophet too. Athens may boast of Virtuous Socrates. The Chief among the Greeks for Moral good. Rome of her Orator, whose fam'd Harangues, Foyl'd the Debauch'd Antony's designs. We him, and with deep Sorrows 'wail his loss; But whether Fate or Art unturn'd his thread, Remains in doubt, Fames lasting Register, Shall leave his Name enroll'd as great as theirs, Who in Phillippi for their Country fell. An Epitaph on the Lord Fairfax. By the Duke ofe Buckingham. [I.] Under this Stone does lye One, born for Victory, Fairfax the Valiant, and the only He, Who e'r, for that alone a Conqueror wou'd be, Both Sexes Virtues were in him combin'd: He had the Fierceness of the Manliest Mind, And eke the Meekness too of Woman kind. He never knew what Envy was, or Hate: His Soul was fill'd with Worth and Honesty; And with another thing quite out, of date, Call'd Modesty. II. He ne're seem'd Impudent, but in the Field; a Place Where Impudence it self dares seldom shew her Face: Had any stranger spy'd him in the Room With some of those whom he had overcome, And had not heard their Talk, but only seen, Their gesture and their meen, They wou'd have sworn he had the Vanquish'd been; For as they brag'd, and dreadful wou'd appear, While they their own ill lucks in War repeated, His Modesty still made him blush, to hear How often he had them Defeated. III. Through his whole Life, the Part he bore Was wonderful, and Great, And yet, it so appear'd in nothing more, Than in his private last retreat: For it's a stranger thing, to find One Man of such a Glorious mind, As can dismiss the Pow'r h' has got, Than Millions of the Polls, and Braves, Those despicable Fools and Knaves, Who such a Pother make, Through dulness and mistake, In seeking after Pow'r, but get it not. IV. When all the Nation he had won, And with expence of Blood had bought, Store great enough he thought, Of Fame and of Renown; He then his Arms laid down, With full as little Pride As if he had been of his Enemies side, Or one of them cou'd do that were undone: He neither Wealth, nor Places sought; For others, not himself, he Fought. He was content to know, For he had found it so, That, when he pleas'd, to Conquer, he was able And left the Spoil and plunder to the Rabble: He might have been a King, But that he understood How much it is a meaner thing To be unjustly Great, than honourably Good. V. This from the World, did admiration draw. And from his Friends, both Love and Awe, Remembring what in Fight he did before: And his Foes lov'd him too, As they were bound to do, Because he was resolv'd to fight no more. So bless'd of all, he Dy'd; but far more bless'd were we, If we were sure to live, till we could see A Man as great in VVar, in Peace, as just as he. An Essay upon the Earl of Shaftsbury's Death. Whenever Tyrants fall, the Air And other Elements prepare To Combat in a Civil-War, Large Oaks up by the Roots are torn, The Savage Train Upon the Forest or the Plain To a Procession through the Sky are born, Sulphureous Fire displays Its baneful Rays, Then from the hollow Womb Of some rent Cloud does come The Blazing Meteor or destructive Stone; Distant below the Grumbling Wind Pent up in Earth' a vent would find; But failing, roars Like broken Waves upon the Rocky Shores. The Earth with Motion rowls, Those Buildings which did brave the Sky, Now in an humble posture lye, While here and there A subtile Priest and Sooth-sayer The Fatal Dirges howl. Thus when the first twelve Cæsars fell, A Jubilee was kept in Hell; But when that Heav'n designs, the Brave Shall quit a Life to fill a Grave, The Sun turns pale and Courts a Cloud, From Mortals sight his Grief to shroud, Shakes from his Face a shower of Rain, And faintly views the World again. The Tombs of Ancient Heroes weep, Hard Marble Tears lets fall: The Genii, who possess the Deep, And seem the Islands Fate to keep, Lament the Funeral. Silence denotes the greatest Woe, So Calms precede a Storm, Deep Waters smoothest are, we know, And bear the evenest form. So 'tis when Patriots cease to be, And hast to Immortality; Their Noble Souls blest Angels bear To the Ethereal Palace there, Mounting upon the ambient Air, While wounded Atomes press the Ear Of Mortals, who far distant are. Hence sudden Grief does seize the Mind, For good and brave agree; Each being Moves unto his Kind By Native Sympathy. So 'twas when mighty Cooper dy'd The Fabius of the Isle, A sullen Look the Great o're-spread, The Common People lookt as dead, And Nature droopt the while. Living; Religion, Liberty, A mighty Fence he stood, Peers Rights and Subjects Property None stronglier did maintain than he, For which Rome sought his Blood. Deep Politician, English Peer, That quash't the Power of Rome, The change of State they brought so near, In bringing Romish Worship here, Was by thy Skill o're-thrown: 'Less Heav'n a Miracle design'd Sure it could never be One so Gyantick in his Mind, That soar'd a-pitch 'bove humane kind, So small a Corps should be. Time was, the Court admir'd thy Shrine, And did the Homage pay: But wisely thou didst Countermine, And having found the black Design, Scorn'd the Ignoble way. Having thus strongly stem'd the Tide, And set thy Country free: Thou, Cato like, an Exile prid'st, 'Mongst Enemies belov'd resid'st, Whilst Good men Envy thee. And as the Sacred Hebrew Seer Canaan to view desir'd; So Heav'n did shew this Noble Peer The end of Popish Malice here, Which done, his Soul Expir'd A Satyr in Answer to a Friend. 1682. 'Tis strange that you, to whom I've long been known, Should ask me why I always rail at th'Town: As a good Hound when he runs near his Prey, With double Eagerness is hard to Bay. So when a Coxcomb doth offend my sight, To ease my Spleen, I straight go home and write: I love to bring Vice ill conceal'd to light. And I have found that they that Satyr write, Alone can season the useful with the sweet. Should I write Songs, and to cool Shades confin'd, Expire with Love, who hate all Women kind! Then in my Closet, like some fighting Sparks, Thinking on Phillis Love upon my works! I grant I might with bolder Muse inspir'd, Some Hero Sing worthy to be admir'd, Our King hath Qualities might entertain, With Noblest Subjects Waller's lofty Pen. But then you'll own no Man is thought his Friend, That doth not love the Pope and York commend. He who his Evil Counsellors dislikes, Say what he will, still like a Traytor speaks. Now I Dissimulation cannot bear, Truth and good Sence, my Lines alike must share. I love to call each Creature by his Name, H?a Knave, S?an Honest Man. With equal scorn I alwaies did abhor, The Effeminate Fops and bustling Men of War. The careful Face of Ministers of State, I alwaies judg'd to be a down-right Cheat. The smilling Courtier, and the Counsellour Grave, I alwaies thought two different Marks of Knave. They that talk loud, and they that draw i'th' Pit, These want of Courage shew, those want of Wit. Thus all the World endeavours to appear, What they'd be thought to be, not what they are. If any then by most unhappy choice, Seek for content in London's crowd and noise. Must form his words and manners to the place, If he'll see Ladies must like Villers dress. In a soft tone without one word of Sence, Must talk of Dancing and the Court of France. Must praise alike the ugly and the fair, Buckly's good Nature, Feltons shape and Hair, Exalt my Lady Portsmouth's Birth and Wit, And vow she's only for a Monarch fit. Although the fawning Coxcombs all do know, She's lain with Beaufort and the Count de Leau. This method with some ends of Plays, Basely apply'd, and drest in a French Phrase To Ladies favour, can e'ne Hewit raise. He that from Business would Preferment get, Plung'd in the Toyls and Infamies of State, All Sence of Honour from his Breast must drive, And in a course of Villanies resolve to live. Must cringe and flatter the King's Owls and Curs, Nay worse, must be obsequious to his Whores. Must alwaies seem to approve what they commend, What they dislike, by him must be contemn'd. And when at last by a thousand different Crimes, The Monster to his wisht-for Greatness climbs, He must in his continu'd greatness wait, With Guilt and Fears, the Imprison'd D?y Fate This Road has H?r and S?r gone, And thus must answer for the Ills they've done. Who then would live in so deprav'd a Town, Where Pleasure is by Folly, Power alone By Infamy obtain'd?? Wise Heraclitus, all his life-time griev'd, Democritus in endless Laughter Liv'd; Yet to the first no fears of Plots were known, Nor Parliaments remov'd to Popish Town, Murthers not favour'd, Virtues not supprest, Laws not derided, Commons not opprest. Nor King, who Claudius like, expels his Son, To make th'Imperious Nero Prince of Rome; Nor yet to move the others merry vane, Did Cuckolds (who each Boy i'th' street could name) Most learned Proof in publick daily give, That they themselves do their own shame contrive; While their Lewd Wives scouring from place to place, T'expose their secret Members, hide their Face. But Lo! how would this Sage have burst his spleen, Had he seen Whore and Fool with merry King, And Ministers of State at Supper sit, Mistaking Bawdy Ribaldry for wit; Whilst C?s with tottering Crown and empty Purse, (Derided by his Foes, to's Friends a Curse) Abandon'd now by every Man of Wit, Delights himself with any he can get. Pimps, Fools, and Parisites, make up the Rout, For want of Wedding Garments, none's left out. But I shall weary both my self and you, To tell you all the Follies that I know. How a great Lord, in numbers soft, thought fit, (Though void of Sense, to set up for a Wit.) And how with wondrous Spirit, he and's Friend An Epitaph to Cruel Cloris pen'd; His Name (I think) I hardly need to tell, For who should be, but the Lord Ar?l. But should I here waste Paper to declare, The senseless Tricks of every silly Peer, I'd as good tell how many several ways, The trusty Duke his Country still betrays. How full the World is stuft with Knave and Fool, How to be very Honest is counted dull. How to speak plain, and greatness to despise, Is thought a Madness, but Flattery is Wise, Dissimulation excellent, to cheat a Friend A very Trifle, provided still our end Be but the Snare We call our Interest, Then nothing is so bad, but that is best; I'le therefore end this vain Satyrick rage, And leave the Bishops to reform the Age. A Character of the English. In Allusion to Tacit. de Vit. Agric. The Free-born English, Generous and Wise, Hate Chains, but do not Government despise: Rights of the Crown, Tribute and Taxes, they When Lawfully Exacted, freely pay. Force they abhor, and Wrong they scorn to bear, More guided by their Judgment than their Fear; Justice with them is never held severe. Here Power by Tyranny was never got; Laws may perhaps Ensnare them, Force cannot: Rash Councils here, have still the same Effect; The surest way to Reign is to protect. Kings are least safe in their unbounded Will, Joyn'd with the Wretch'd Power of doing ill. Forsaken most when they're most Absolute; Laws guard the Man, and only bind the Brute: To Force that Guard, and with the worst to joyn, Can never be a prudent Kings design; What King would chuse to be a Cataline? Break his own Laws, stake an unquestion'd Throne, Conspire with Vassals to Usurp his own; 'Tis rather some base Favourites Vile pretence, To Tyrannize at the wrong'd King's expence. Let France grow Proud, beneath the Tyrants Lust, While the Rackt People crawl and lick the Dust: The mighty Genious of this Isle disdains Ambitious Slavery and Golden Chains. England to servile Yoke did ne'er bow, What Conquerours ne'er presum'd, who dares do now. Roman nor Norman ever could pretend To have Enslav'd, but made this Isle their Friend. Cullen with his Flock of Misses, 1679. As Cullen drove his Sheep along, By VVhitehall there was such a throng Of Earls Coaches at the Gate, The silly Swain was forc'd to wait. Chance threw him on Sir Edward S? The silly Knight that Rhimes to Mutton: Cullen, (said he,) this is the Day, For which poor England once did pray; The day that sets our Monarch free, From butter'd Buns and Slavery. This hour from French Intreages, ('tis said,) He'll clear his Council and his Bed. Portsmouth he vouchsafes to know, Was the cast Whore of Count de Loe. She must return and sell her place, Buyers (you see) flock in a pace; Silence i'th' Court being once Proclaim'd, In steps fair Ri?d once so fam'd: She offers much but was refus'd, And of miscarriages accus'd. Nor would his Majesty accept her At thirty, who at Fifteen left her: She blusht, and Modestly withdrew: Next M?ton appeared in View, Who streight was told of M?ue. Of Cates from Hide; of Cloaths from France, Of Arm pits, Toes of Nauseance; At which the Court set up a Laughter, She never pleads but for her Daughter, A Buxom lass fit for the place, Were not her Father in disgrace: Besides some strange incestuous stories Of H?y and her long C?ies: With these exceptions she's dismist, And M?nd Fair enters the List: Husband in Hand most descently, And begs at any rate to Buy: She offered Jewels of great price, And dear Sir Samuels next Device. Whether it be a Pump or Table. Glass House or any other Bauble; But she was told she had been try'd, And for good Reason lay'd aside. Next in steps pretty Lady G?y, Offers her Lord should nothing say; 'Gainst the next Treasurer accused, So her pretence was not refus'd: R? in rage bid her be gone, And play her game out with her Son; Or if she lik'd an aged Carcass For L? get a Noble Marquess. Sh?ry offered for the place, All she had gotten from his Grace; D? of B? She knew his wants, and could comply With all his wants of Leachery. She was dismist with Scorn and told Where a Tall P? was to be Sold. Then in came Dowdy M?ine, That Foreign Antiquated Quean; Who soon was told the King no more Would deal with an Intrigueing Whore: That she already had about her Too good an Equipage de Foutre; Her Grace at these rebukes lookt Blank, And sneakt away to Villan F?k. Fair L? too her claim put in, 'Twas urg'd she was to much a Kin: She modestly reply'd no more A Kin than S?x was before: Besides she had often haerd her Mother Call her the Daughter of another: She did not drivel and had sence, To which all his had no pretence; Yet for the present she's put off, And told she was not VVhore enough. L?s smil'd at that exception, And doubted not of good Reception. Put in her claim, Vowing she'd Steal All that her Husband wore of Veal: To Buy the place, all she could get, By his long Suit with Mr. Pitt: But from Goliah's size of Goth, Down to the Pitch of little VVroth; The Court was told she lay wiht all, The roaring Roysters of Whitehall: For which old R? lest she'd grudge, Gave her the making of a Judge: She bow'd and straight went her way, To Haunt the Court, Park, and Play, In stept Stately Carry F?er, streight the whole Court began to Praise her: As fine as Chains and Point could make her, She vow'd the King or Goal must take her. R? reply'd, he was Retrenching, And Vow'd no more of costly Wenching: That she was Proud and went too Gaudy, Nor could she Swear, Drink or talk Bawdy, Virtues requisite for that place More than Youth, VVit, or a good Face. C?and offered down a Million, But she was soon told of Castillion; At that name she fell a weeping And swore she was undone with Keeping: That C?, G?, had so drain'd her, She could not live on the Remainder: The Court said, there was no Record, Of any to that place Restor'd, Nor might the King at these Years venture, VVho in his Prime could not content her. Young Lady J?s stept up and urg'd, She'd give the Deed her Father Forg'd: But she was told her Family VVas tainted with Presbytery: She said her Mother with clean Heart And Hand, had lately done her part, In bringing M?ne to Bed, Nor was't her fault the Babe was Dead: For her R?y own'd his Passion, But said, he staid for Declaration. Ingaged, no matter of great weight, To pass till after some debate In his great Council so they Adjourn'd, And Cullen with his Flocks return'd. Swearing there was at every Fair Blither Girls than any there. Sir Tho. Armstrong's Ghost. The groans, dear Armstrong, which the world employ, Would please thy Ghost, to see transform'd to joy: Had'st thou abroad found safety in thy flight, Thy immortal honour had not shin'd so bright; Thou still hadst been a worthy Patriot thought; But now thy glory's to perfection brought. In Exile and in Death to England true, What more could Brutus or just Cato do? What can the Villains spread to blast thy fame, Unless thy former Loyalty they blame? To be concern'd the Stuarts to restore, Is a reproach that hardly can be bore. The utmost Plague a Nation could befall, Like the forbidden Fruit, it curst us all. Yet thou in season a brave convert grew, Abhorr'd their counsels and their int'rest too: And death at last before their smiles preferr'd; So holy Cranmer burnt the hand that err'd. Let 'em now place thy Quarters in the Air, 'Twill please thy soul to think they flourish there: Thou scorn'st to hope for freedom in the Grave; And slombring lie, whilst England was a Slave: Thy Carcass stands a Monument to all, Till the whole Progeny a Victim fall; And like their Father, tread that Stage, which some, In a blasphemous strain, call Martyrdom; For they in guilt transcendently excell, All that e'er Poets or Historians tell To act fresh Murders, and by Flames devour, Is but the recreation of their power: For they alone are for destruction chose, Who either Rome or Tyranny oppose: Tarquin and Nero were but Types of these, In whom all crimes are in their last degrees. Swelling like Nile in a prodigious Flood Of execrable Villanies and Blood: Yet how the age their Lives and Peace betray, And those whom th'ought to sacrifice th'obey. They lick up Poyson and to Tortures run, And madly hug all Egypt's Plagues in one. Degenerous Slaves! such Monsters to adore, Was ever Sodom so carest before? Quick vengeance put a period to their breath, By their destruction ease the groaning earth: For Mortals attempt the righteous work in vain; Heaven it self does th'immediate glory claim, For they're reserv'd by Thunder to be slain. The Royal Game: or, A Princely new Play found in a Dream, &amp;c. The attribution of this poem is questionable. 1672. PROLOGUE. Whoever looks about and minds things well, And on Affairs abroad doth take a view, May think the Story which I here do tell Was never dream't it falleth out so true. I do confess it's something hard to find A crooked Path directly in the dark; And while a Man's asleep you know he's blind, And can't easily hit on a Mark. Well, be it so, yet this you know is right, What's seen i'th' Day is dream't again at Night. A Dream I hope will no wise man offend, Nor will it Treason be (I trow) to lend A Copy of my Dream unto my Friend. Caball beware your Shins, For thus my Tale begins. The Dream of the Caball: A Prophetick Satyr. Anno 1672. As 'tother Night in Bed I thinking lay, How I my Rent shou'd to my Landlord pay, Since Corn, nor Wool, nor Beast would Money make; Tumbling perplext, these Thoughts kept me awake. What will become of this mad World, quoth I? What's its Disease? what is its Remedy? Where will it issue? whereto does it tend? Some ease to Misery 'tis to know its end. Till Servants Dreaming, as they us'd to doe, Snor'd me asleep, I fell a Dreaming too. Methought there met the Grand Caball of Seven, (Odd numbers some men say do best please Heaven) When sate they were, and Doors were all fast shut, I secret was behind the Hangings put: Both hear and see I could; but he that there Had placed me, bad me have as great a care Of stirring, as my life: and ere that out From thence I came, resolv'd shou'd be my Doubt. What would become of this mad World, unless Present Designs were cross'd with ill success? An awfull Silence there was held some space, Till trembling, thus began one call'd his Grace. Great Sir, your Government for first twelve years Has spoil'd the Monarchy, and made our Fears Buck. So potent on us, that we must change quite Th'old Foundations, and make new, wrong or right. For too great mixture of Democracy Within this Government allay'd must be; And no allay like nulling Parliaments O'th' Peoples Pride and Arrogance, the vents Factious and Saucy, disputing Royal Pleasure, Who your Commands by their own humors measure. For King in Barnacles (and to th'Rack-Staves ty'd) You must remain, if these you will abide. So spake the Long blue-Ribbon: then a Second, Though not so tall, yet quite as wise is reckon'd, Orm. Did thus begin: Great Sir, you are now on A tender Point much to be thought upon, And thought on only; for by Ancient Law, 'Twas Death to mention what my Lord foresaw; His trembling shew'd it, wherefore I'm so bold To advise it's standing, lest it shou'd be told We did attempt to change it; for so much Our Ancestors secur'd it, that to touch, Like Sacred Mount, 'tis Death; and such a Trick, I no-ways like my Tongue should break my Neck. Thus said, he sate. Then Lord of Northern Tone, Lauderd: In Gall and Guile a second unto none, Inraged rose, and Col'rick, thus began. Dread Majesty, Male beam of Fame, a Son Of th'hundred and tenth Monarch of the Nore; De'l split the Weam of th'Loon that spoke afore, Shame saw the Cragg of that ill-manner'd Lord, That nent his King durst speak so faw a word; And aw my Saul, right weell the first man meant, De'l hoop his Luggs that loves a Parliament. Twa Houses aw my Saul are too too mickle, They'll gar the Leard shall near have more a prickle; No Money get to gee the bonny Lass, But full as good be Born without a— Ten thousand Plagues light on his Cragg (that gang) To make you be but third part of a King. De'l take my Saul I'll near the matter mince, I'd rather Subject be than sike a Prince. To Hang, and Burn, and Slay, and Draw, and Kill, And measure aw things by my awn gude will, Is gay Dominion; a Checkmate I hate, Of Men, or Laws, it looks so like a State. This eager well-meant Zeal some Laughter stirr'd; Till Nose half Plush, half Flesh, the Inkhorn Lord Crav'd Audience thus. Grave Majesty Divine, Arlingt. (Pardon that Cambridge Title, I make mine) We now are enter'd on the great'st Debate That can concern your Throne and Royal State. His Grace hath so spoke all, that we who next Speak after, can but comment on his Text: Only 'tis wonder at this sacred Board, Shou'd sit 'mongst us a Magna Charta Lord, A Peer of old Rebellious Barons breed, Worst, and great'st Enemies to Royal Seed. But to proceed; well was it urg'd by's Grace, Such Liberty was given for twelve years space, That are by past, there's no necessity Of new Foundations, if safe you'll be. What Travel, Charge and Art, before was set This Parliament, we had, you can't forget; Now force, cajole, and court, and bribe for fear They wrong should run, e'er since they have been here What diligence, what study, day and night Was on us, and what care to keep them right? Wherefore (if good) you can't make Parliament, On whom such Costs, such Art, and Pains were spent, And Moneys, all we had for them to do; Since we miss that, 'tis best dismiss them too. 'Tis true, this House the best is you can call, But in my Judgment, best is none at all: Well mov'd, the whole Cabal cry'd, Parliaments Are cloggs to Princes, and their brave intents. One did object, 'twas against Majesty To obey the Peoples pleasure. Another he Their Inconvenience argues, and that neither Close their Designs were, nor yet speedy either. Whilst thus confused chatter'd the Cabal, And many mov'd, none heard, but speak did all; A little bobtail'd Lord, Urchin of State, Chancell. Shafts. A Praise-God-bare-bone Peer whom all men hate, Amphibious Animal, half Fool, half Knave; Begg'd silence, and this purblind Counsel gave: Blest and best Monarch that e'er Scepter bore, Renown'd for Vertue, but for Honour more; That Lord spake last, has well and wisely shown, That Parliaments, nor new, nor old, nor none Can well be trusted longer; for the State And Glory of the Crown hate all Checkmate. That Monarchy may from its Childhood grow To man's Estate; France has taught us how Monarchy's Divine: Divinity it shows, That he goes backward, that not forward goes. Therefore go on, let other Kingdoms see Your Will's your Law, that's absolute Monarchy; A mixt hodge podge will now no longer do, Cæsar or nothing, You are brought unto: Strike then, Great Sir, 'fore these Debates take wind, Remember that Occasion's bald behind Our Game is sure in this, if wisely play'd, And sacred Votes to th'Vulgar not betray'd; But if the Rumor shou'd once get on wing, That we consult to make you abs'lute King, The Plebeians head, the Gentry, forsooth, They strait would snort and have an aking Tooth; Lest they, I say, should your great Secrets scent, And you oppose in nulling Parliament. I think it safer, and a greater skill To obviate, than to or'ecome an Ill: For those that head the Herd are full as rude, When th'humor takes, as th'following Multitude; Therefore be quick in your Resolves, and when Resol'd you have, execute quicker then Remember your great Father lost the Game By slow Proceedings, may'nt you do the same? An unexpected, unregarded blow Wounds more than ten made by an open Foe. Delays do Dangers breed; the Sword is yours, By Law declar'd, what need of other Powers? We may unpolitick be judg'd, or worse, If we can't make the Sword command the Purse; No Art, or Courtship can the rule so shape Without a Force, it must be done by Rape: And when 'tis done, to say you cannot help, Will satisfie enough the gentle Whelp. Phanaticks they'll to Providence impute Their Thraldom, and immediately grow mute; For they, poor pious Fools, think the Decree Of Heaven falls on them, though from Hell it be; And when their reason is abas'd to it, They forthwith think't Religion to submit, And vainly glorying in a passive Shame, They'll put off Man to wear the Christian Name: Wherefore to lull 'em, do their Hopes fulfill With Liberty, they're halter'd at your Will; Give them but Conventicle-room, and they Will let you steal the Englishman away, And heedless be, till you your Nets have spread, And pull'd down Conventicles on their head. Militia therefore and Parliaments cashier, A formidable standing Army rear, They'll mount you up, and up you soon will be, They'll fear who ne'er did love your Monarchy: And if they fear, no matter for their hate; To rule by Law becomes a sneaking State. Lay by all Fear, care not what People say, Regard to them will your Designs betray: When bite they can't, what hurt can barking do? And, Sir, in time we'll spoil their barking too, Make Coffee-Clubs, talk of more humble things Than State Affairs, and Interest of Kings. Thus spake the Rigling Peer, when one more grave, That had much less of Fool, but more of Knave, Began: Great Sir, it gives no small content, Cliff. To hear such Zeal (for you) 'gainst Parliament; Wherefore, though I an Enemy no less To Parliaments than you your selves profess; Yet I must also enter my protest 'Gainst these rude rumbling Counsels indigest. And, Great Sir, tell you, 'tis an harder thing Than they suggest, to make you abs'lute King; Old Buildings to pull down, believe it true, More danger in it hath, than building New. And what shall prop your Superstructure till Another you have built that suits your Will? An Army shall, say they (content) but stay, From whence shall this new Army have its pay? For easie gentle Government a while Must first appear this Kingdom to beguile The Peoples minds, and make them cry up you, For rasing Old, and making better New. For Taxes with new Government, all will blame, And put the Kingdom soon into a flame: For Tyranny has no such lovely look To catch Men with, unless you hide the Hook; And no Bait hides it more than present Ease; Ease but their Taxes, then do what you please. Wherefore, all wild debates laid by, from whence Shall Money rise to bear this vast expence? For our first thoughts thus well resolved, we In other things much sooner shall agree; Join then with Mother Church, whose bosom stands Ope to receive us, stretching forth her Hands; Close but this breach and she will let you see Her Purse as open as her Arms shall be. For sacred Sir, (by guess I do not speak) Of poor she'll make you rich, and strong of weak. At home, abroad, no Money, no, nor Men, She'll let you lack, turn but to her again. The Scot could here no longer hold, but cry'd, Laud. De'l take the Pape, and all that's on his side; The Whore of Rome, that mickle Man of Sin, Plague take the Mother, Bearns, and aw the Kin. What racks my Saul! must we the holy Rood Place in God's Kirk again? troth 'tis not gude, I defy the Loon, the De'l and aw his works, The Pape shall lig no mare in God's gude Kirk. The Scot with Laughter check'd, they all agreed, The Lord spoke last shou'd in his Speech proceed, Cliff. Which thus he did; Great Sir, You know 'tis Season Salts all the motions that we make with reason; And now a season is afforded us, The best e'er came and most propitious. Besides the Summ the Cath'licks will advance, You know the Offers we are made from France; And to have Money and no Parliament, Must fully answer your design'd intent. And thus without tumultuous noise, or huff Of Parliaments, you may have Money enough; Which, if neglected now, there's none knows when Like Opportunities may be had again, For all to extirpate, now combined be, Both civil and religious Liberty. Thus Money you'll have to exalt the Crown, Without stooping Majesty to Country Clown. The triple League, I know, will be objected, As if that ought by us to be respected; But who to Hereticks, or Rebel pay'th The Truth ingag'd to by solemn Faith, Debaucheth Vertue, by those very things, The Church profaneth and debaseth Kings, As you your self have admirably shown By burning solemn Cov'nant, though your own; Faith, Justice, Truth, Plebeian Vertues be, Look well in them, but not in Majesty. For publick Faith is but a publick Thief, The greatest Cheat in Nature's vain Belief. The second Lord though check'd, yet did not fear, Impatient grew and could no longer bear, But rose in heat, and that a little rude The Lord's voice interrupts, and for Audience su'd: Great Majesty, authentick Authors say, When hand was lifted up, Cræsus to slay, The Father's danger on th'Dumb Son did make Such deep Impressions that he forthwith spake. Pardon, great Sir, if I, in imitation, Seeing the danger to your Land and Nation, Do my resolv'd on silence also break, Although I see the matter I shall speak, Under such disadvantages will fall, That it, as well as I, exploded shall; But vainly do they boast they Loyal are, That can't for Princes good, Reflections bear; Nor will I call Compurgators to prove, What honour to the Crown I've born, with Love, My Acts have spoken, and sufficient are, Above what e'er Detractors did or dare. Wherefore, great Sir, 'tis Ignorance, or hate Dictates these Counsels, you to precipitate. For say't again I will, not eat my word, No Council's Power, no, nor yet the Sword Can old Foundations alter or make new: Let time interpret who hath spoken true. Those Country Gentry, with their Beef and Bacon, Will shew how much you Courtiers are mistaken; For Parliaments are not of that cheap rate, That they will down without a broken Pate; And then I doubt you'll find those worthy Lords More Braves and Champions with their Tongue than Swords. Wherefore, Dread Sir, encline not Royal Ear To their Advice, but safer Counsels hear; Stay till these Lords have got a Crown to lose, And then consult with them which way they'll chuse. Will you all hazard for their humours sake, Who nothing have to lose, nothing at stake; And at one Game your Royal Crown expose, To gratifie the foolish Lusts of those, Who hardly have Subsistence how to live, But what your Crown and Grace to them does give? And one of those (Bagpudding) Gentlemen, (Except their places) would buy nine or ten: Then, why they should thus slight the Gentleman, I see no reason, nor think how they can; For had not Gentleman done more than Lord, I'll boldly say't, you ne'er had been restor'd. But why, of Armies now, great Sir, must we (So fond just now) all on the sudden be? What faithfull Guardians have they been to Pow'rs That have employ'd 'em, that you'd make 'em yours? Enough our Age, we need not seek the glory Of Armies Faith, in old, or doubtfull Story: Your Father 'gainst the Scots an Army rear'd, But soon, that Army more than Scot he fear'd: He was in hast to raise them, as we are, But to disband them was far more his care; How Scottish Army after did betray His Trust and Person both, I need not say. Rump Parliament an Army rear'd, and they The Parliament that rais'd them, did betray; The Lord Protector they set up one hour, The next pull'd down the Protectorian pow'r. Your Father's Block and Judges the same Troops Did guard some Tongues at Death of both made hoops: And will you suffer Armies to beguile, And give your Crown and them to cross and pile? What if as Monk should both swear, lie and feign, Till he does both your Trust and Army gain, And you believe his Oath and Faith is true, But serves himself instead of serving you. Pardon, great Sir, if Zeal transports my Tongue, 'Texpress what your Greatness don't become. Expose I can't your Crown and sacred Throat To the false Faith of a common Red-coat. Your Law, your All does fence secure from Fears; That kept, what trouble needs of Bandileers? Consider, Sir, 'tis Law that makes you King, The Sword another to the Crown may bring; For Force knows no distinction, longest Sword Makes Peasant Prince, Lacquey above his Lord. If that be all that we must have for Laws, Your Will inferiour may be to Jack Straw's. If greater Force him follow; there's no Right Where Law is failing, and for Will men fight. Best Man is he alone whose Steel's most strong; Where no Law is, there's neither right nor wrong. That Fence broke down, and all in common laid, Subjects may Prince, and Prince may them invade. See, greatest Sir, how these your Throne lay down, Instead of making great your Royal Crown, How they divest you of your Majesty: For Law destroy'd, you are no more than we. And very vain would be the Plea of Crown, When Statute-Laws, and Parliaments are down. This Peer proceeded on to shew how vain An Holy League would be with Rome again, And what dishonour 'twould be to our Crowns, If unto France give cautionary Towns. He's interrupted, and bid speak no more, By's enraged Majesty, who deeply swore, His Tongue had so run o'er, that he'd take Such Vengeance on him, and example make To after Ages, all which heard should fear, To speak what wou'd displease the Royal Ear; And bid the Lord that spoke before, go on, And Silence all should keep till he had done; Who thus his Speech re'ssum'd. If Lord spake last, To interrupt me had not made such hast, I soon had done; for I was come, Great Sir, T'advise your sending Dutch Embassador; But much it does concern you whom to trust, With this Embassy: for none true, nor just, Wise, Stout, or Honourable, nor a Friend, Should you in any wise resolve to send, Lest any unseen, or unlucky Chance Shou'd in this War befall to us or France. We may that loathed wretch give to the hate Of th'Peoples fury, them to satiate. And when all's done that can be done by man, Much must be left to chance, do what we can. And if you'll make all Christendom your Friend, And put to Dutch-Land-League an utter end; Then surely you may have of Men and Treasure Enough of both to execute your Pleasure. This Speech being ended, five or six agree, France shall be lov'd, and Holland hated be. All gone, I wak'd, and wondred what should mean All I had heard, methought 'twas more than Dream. And if Cabal thus serves us Englishmen, 'Tis ten to one but I shall dream again. On the Three Dukes killing the Beadle on Sunday Morning, Febr. the 26th, 1670–1. Near Holborne lies a Park of great Renown, The place, I do suppose is not unknown. For brevity's sake the Name I shall not tell, Because most genteel Readers know it well, (Since middle Park near Charing-Cross was made, They say there is a great decay of Trade) 'Twas there a Gleeke of Dukes by Fury brought With bloody Mind a sickly Damsel sought, And against Law her Castle did invade, To take from her her Instrument of Trade, 'Tis strange (but sure they thought not on't before) Three Bastard Dukes should come t'undoe one Whore. Murder was cry'd (truth is, her case was sad) When she was like to lose ev'n all she had: In came the Watch, disturb'd with Sleep and Ale, By shrill Noises, but they could not prevail, T'appease their Graces; straight rose Mortal Jarrs Betwixt the Night black Guard and Silver Stars; Then fell the Beadle by a Ducal Hand, For daring to pronounce the Sawcy Stand. The way in Blood certain Renown to win, Is first with bloody Noses to begin. The high-born Youths their hasty Errand tell, Dam ye you Rogue, we'll send your Soul to Hell. They need not send a Messenger before, They're too well known there to stay long at Door. See what mishaps dare ev'n invade Whitehall; This silly Fellow's death puts off the Ball, And disappoints the Queen, poor little Chuck, I warrant 'twould have danc'd it like a Duck. The Fidlars, Voices, Entries, all the sport, And the gay Show put off, where the brisk Court Anticipates in rich Subsidy-Coats All that is got by mercenary Votes: Yet shall Whitehall the Innocent, the Good, See these men dance all daub'd with Lace and Blood. Near t'other Park there stands an aged Tree, As fit as if 'twere made o'th' nonce for Three; Where that no Ceremony may be lost, Each Duke for State may have a several Post. What Storms may rise out of so black a Cause, If such Turd-Flies shall break through Cobweb Laws? The History of Insipids; A Lampoon, 1676. The attribution of this poem is questionable. By the Lord Roch?r. 1 Chaste, pious, prudent, C? the Second, The Miracle of thy Restoration, May like to that of Quails be reckon'd Rain'd on the Israelitick Nation; The wisht for Blessing from Heav'n sent, Became their Curse and Punishment. 2 The Vertues in thee, C? inherent, Although thy Countenance be an odd-piece, Proves thee as true a God's Vicegerent As e're was Harry with the Codpiece: For Chastity and pious Deeds, His Grandsire Harry, C? exceeds. 3 Our Romish Bondage-breaker Harry, Espoused half a dozen Wives; C? onely one resolv'd to marry, And other Mens he never— Yet hath he Sons and Daughters more, Than e're had Harry by threescore. 4 Never was such a Faiths Defender, He like a politick Prince, and pious, Gives liberty to Conscience tender, And doth to no Religion tye us. Jews, Turks, Christians, Papists, he'll please us, With Moses, Mahomet, or J? 5 In all Affairs of Church or State, He very zealous is, and able, Devout at Prayers, and sits up late At the Caball and Council-Table; His very Dog at Council-Board, Sits grave and wise as any Lord. 6 Let C? his Policy no man flout, The wisest Kings have all some Folly; Nor let his Piety any doubt; J? like a Sovereign wise and holy, Make young men Judges of the Bench, And B? some that love a Wench. 7 His Father's Foes he doth reward, Preserving those that cut off's Head: Old Cavaliers the Crown's best Guard, He lets them starve for want of Bread. Never was any King endow'd With so much Grace and Gratitude. 8 Blood that wears Treason in his Face, Villain compleat, in Parson's Gown, How much is he at, Court in Grace For stealing Ormond and the Crown? Since Loyalty does no Man good, Let's steal the King and out-do Blood. 9 A Parliament of Knaves and Sots, Members by name, you must not mention, He keeps in Pay, and buys their Votes, Here with a Place, there with a Pension. When to give Money he can't cologue 'um, He doth with Scorn prorogue, prorogue 'um. 10 But they long since by too much giving, Undid, betray'd, and sold the Nation; Making their Memberships a Living, Better than e'er was Sequestration. God give thee C? a Resolution To damn the Knaves by Dissolution. 11 Fame is not grounded on Success, Though Victories were Cæsar's Glory; Lost Battels make not Pompey less, But left them stiled great in Story. Malitious Fate doth oft devise To beat the Brave and fool the Wise. 12 C? in the first Dutch War stood fair To have been Sovereign of the Deep; When Opdam blew up in the Air, Had not his Highness gone to sleep. Our Fleet slack'd Sails, fearing his waking, The Dutch else had been in sad taking. 13 The Bergen Business was well laid, Though we paid dear for that Design: Had we not three days parling staid, The Dutch Fleet there, C? had been thine. Though the false Dane agree'd to sell 'um, He cheated us, and saved Skellum. 14 Had not C? sweetly choos'd the States, By Bergen baffle grown more wise, And made them Shit as small as Rats, By their rich Smyrna Fleets Surprize. Had haughty Holms but call'd in Spragg, Hans had been put into a Bag. 15 Mists, Storms, short Victuals, adverse Winds, And once the Navies wise Division, Defeated C? his best designs, Till he became his Foes Derision. But he had swing'd the Dutch at Chattam, Had he had Ships but to come at 'um. 16 Our Blackheath Host without dispute, Rais'd, (put on Board, why, no man knows) Must C? have rendred absolute, Over his Subjects or his Foes. Has not the French King made us Fools, By taking Maestricht with our Tools? 17 But C? what could thy Policy be, To run so many sad Disasters; To join thy Fleet with false D' Etrees, To make the French of Holland Masters? Was't Carewell, Brother James, or Teague, That made thee break the Triple League? 18 Could Robin Viner have foreseen The glorious Triumphs of his Master, The Wool-Church Statue Gold had been, Which now is made of Alabaster: But wise Men think had it been Wood, 'Twere for a Bankrupt K? too good. 19 Those that the Fabrick well consider, Do of it diversly discourse; Some pass their Censure of the Rider, Others their Judgment of the Horse: Most say the Steed's a goodly thing, But all agree 'tis a Lewd K?. 20 By the Lord Mayor and his grave Coxcombs, Free-man of London C? is made; Then to Whitehall a Rich Gold Box comes, Which was bestow'd on the French Jade. But wonder not it should be so, Sirs, When Monarchs rank themselves with Grocers. 21 Cringe, scrape, no more, ye City Fops, Leave off your Feasting and fine Speeches, Beat up your Drums, shut up your Shops, The Courtiers then will kiss your Breeches. Arm'd, tell the Popish Duke that rules, You're Free-born Subjects, not French Mules. 22 New Upstarts, Pimps, Bastards, Whores, That Locust-like devour the Land, By shutting up th'Exchequer Doors, When thither our Money was trapan'd, Have rendred C? his Restauration, But a small Blessing to the Nation. 23 Then C? beware of thy Brother Y? Who to thy Government gives Law; If once we fall to the old Sport, You must again both to Breda: Where spight of all that would restore you, Grown wise by wrongs, we shall abhor you. 24 If of all Christian Blood the guilt Cry loud for Vengeance unto Heaven; That Sea by treacherous Lewis spilt, Can never be by God forgiven. Worse Scourge unto his Subjects, Lord, Than Pestilence, Famine, Fire or Sword. 25 That false rapacious Wolf of France, The Scourge of Europe, and its Curse, Who at his Subjects cry, does dance, And study how to make them worse. To say such Kings, Lord, rule by thee, Were most prodigious Blasphemy. 26 Such know no Law but their own Lust, Their Subjects Substance, and their Blood, They count it Tribute due and just, Still spent and spilt for Subjects good. If such Kings are by God appointed, The D? may be the L? Anointed. 27 Such Kings curst be the Power and Name, Let all the World henceforth abhor 'em; Monsters which Knaves sacred proclaim, And then like Slaves fall down before 'em. What can there be in Kings Divine? The most are Wolves, Goats, Sheep, or Swine. 28 Then farewell sacred Majesty, Let's pull all Brutish Tyrants down; When Men are born, and still live free, Here ev'ry Head doth wear a Crown. Mankind like miserable Frogs, Prove wretched, King'd by Storks and Logs. ROCHESTER's Farewell, 1680. The attribution of this poem is questionable. Tir'd with the noysome Follies of the Age, And weary of my part, I quit the Stage; For who in Life's dull Farce a part would bear, Where Rogues, Whores, Bawds, all the head Actors are? Long I with charitable Malice strove, Lashing the Court, those Vermin to remove, But thriving Vice under the Rod still grew, As aged Letchers whipp'd, their Lust renew; Yet though my Life hath unsuccessfull been, (For who can this Augæan Stable clean) My gen'rous end I will pursue in Death, And at Mankind rail with my parting breath. First then, the Tangier Bullies must appear, With open Bravery, and dissembled Fear: Mulg?e their Head, but Gen'ral have a care, Though skill'd in all those Arts that cheat the fair, The undiscerning and impartial Moor, Spares not the Lover on the Ladies score. Think how many perish by one fatal shot, The Conquests all thy Goggling ever got. Think then (as I presume you do) how all The English Ladies will lament your fall; Scarce will there greater Grief pierce every heart, Should Sir George Hewit or Sir Carr depart. Had it not better been than thus to roam, To stay and tie the Cravat-string at home? To strut, look big, shake Pantaloon, and swear With Hewit, Dame, there's no Action there. Had'st thou no Friend that wou'd to Rouly write, To hinder this thy eagerness to fight? That without danger thou a Brave might'st be, As sure to be deny'd as Shrews?y. This sure the Ladies had not fail'd to do, But who such Courage could suspect in you? For say, what reason could with you prevail, To change Embroider'd Coat for Coat of Mail? Let Plim?h, or let Mord?t go, whom Fate Has made not valiant but desperate. For who could not be weary of his Life, Who's lost his Money, or has got a Wife? To the more tolerable Alcaid of Alcazzer, One flies from Creditors, the other from Frazier; 'Twere cruelty to make too sharp Remarks, On all the little, forward, fighting Sparks; Only poor Charles I can't but pity thee, When all the pert young Voluntiers I see. Those Chits of War, who as much Mirth create As the Pair Royal of the Chits of State: Their Names shall equal all excelling Glory, Chit Sund?d, Chit God?n, and Chit L?y. When thou let'st Plim?h, 'twas such a jest, As when the Brother made the same request; Had Rich?d but got leave as well as he, The Jest had been compleat and worthy thee. Well, since he must, he'll to Tangier advance It is resolv'd, but first let's have a Dance First, at her Highness Ball he must appear, And in a parting Country Dance, learn there With Drum and Fife to make a Jigg of War; What is of Soldier seen in all the heap, Besides the flutt'ring Feather in the Cap, The Scarf, and Yard or two of Scarlet Cloath, From Gen'ral Mulg?e down to little Wroth? But now they're all embark'd and curse there Fate, Curse Charles that gave them leave, and much more Kate, Who then Tangier to England and the King No greater Plague, besides her self, could bring; And wish the Moors, since now their hand is in, As they have got her Portion, had the Queen. There leave we them and back to England come, Whereby the wiser Sparks that stay at home, In safe Ideas by their fancy form'd, Tangier (like Maestrich) is at Windsor storm'd. But now we talk of Maestrich, where is he, Fam'd for that brutal piece of Bravery? He with his thick impenetrable Skull, The solid, hard'ned Armour of a Fool: Well might himself to all Wars ills expose, Who (come what will yet) had no Brains to lose. Yet this is he, the dull unthinking he, Who must (forsooth) our future Monarch be, This Fool by Fools (Armstrong and Vern?n) led, Dreams that a Crown will drop upon his Head, By great example he this Path doth tread, Following such sensless Asses up and down, (For Saul sought Asses when he found a Crown) But Rosse is risen as Samuel at his call, To tell that God hath left the ambitious Saul. Never (says Heaven) shall the blushing Sun, See P?s Bastard fill the Regal Throne. So Heaven says, but Bran?n says he shall, But whoe'er he protects is sure to fall. Who can more certain of Destruction be, Than he that trusts to such a Rogue as he? What good can come from him who York forsook, T'espouse the Interest of this Booby Duke? But who the best of Masters could desert, Is the most fit to take a Traytor's part. Ungratefull! This thy Master-piece of sin, Exceeds ev'n that with which thou did'st begin. Thou great Proficient in the Trade of Hell, Whose latter Crimes still do thy first excell: The very top of Villany we seize, By steps in order, and by just degrees. None e'er was perfect Villain in one day, The murder'd Boy to Treason led the way; But when degrees of Villany we name, How can we choose but think on Buck?m? He who through all of them hath boldly ran, Lest ne'er a Law unbroke of God or Man. His treasured Sins of Supererogation, Swell to a summ enough to damn a Nation: But he must here, per force, be let alone, His acts require a Volume of their own: Where rank'd in dreadfull order shall appear, All his Exploits from Shrews?y to Le Meer. But stay, methinks I on a sudden find, My Pen to treat of th'other Sex, inclin'd; But where in all this choice shall I begin? Where, but with the renowned Mazarine? For all the Bawds the Courts rank Soil doth bear, And Bawds and States-men grow in plenty there. To thee submit and yield, should we be just, To thy experienc'd and well travell'd Lust: Thy well-known Merits claim that thou should'st be, First in the Glorious Roll of Infamy. To thee they all give place, and Homage pay, Do all thy Letcherous Decrees obey; (Thou Queen of Lust, thy Bawdy Subjects they.) While Sussex, Brug?ll, Betty Felton come, Thy Whores of Honour, to attend thy Throne; For what proud Strumpet e'er could merit more, Than be Anointed the Imperial Whore? For tell me in all Europe, where's the part, That is not conscious of thy Lewd desert. The great Pedalian Youth, whose Conquests run O'er all the World, and travel'd with the Sun, Made not his Valour in more Nations known, Than thou thy Lust, thy matchless Lust have shown. All Climes, all Countries do with Tribute come, (Thou World of Lewdness) to thy boundless Womb: Thou Sea of Lust, that never ebb dost know, Whither the Rivers of all Nations flow. Lewd Messaline was but a Type of thee, Thou highest, last degree of Letchery: For in all Ages, except her and you, Who ever sinn'd so high, and stoop'd so low? She to th'Imperial Bed each Night did use, To bring the stink of the exhausted Stews; Tir'd (but not satisfy'd) with Man did come, Drunk with abundant Lust, and reeling home. But thou to our admiring Age dost show More sin than inn'cent Rome did ever know; And having all her Lewdnesses out-ran, Takes up with Devil, having tir'd Man: For what is else that loathsome ugly Black, Which you and Sussex in your Arms do take? Nor does old Age, which now rides on so fast, Make thee come short of all thy Lewdness past: Though on thy Head, Grey Hairs like Etna's Snow Are shed, thou'rt Fire and Brimstone all below. Thou monstrous thing, in whom at once does rage The flames of Youth and Impotence of Age. My Lady Dutchess takes the second place, Proud with thy favour and peculiar grace; Ev'n she with all her Piety and Zeal, The hotter flames that burn in thee does feel. Thou dost into her kindling breast inspire, The lustfull Seeds of thy contagious fire; So well the Spirit and the Flesh agree, Lust and Devotion, Zeal and Letchery. Important use Religion's made, By those who wisely drive the cheating Trade; As Wines prohibited securely pass, Changing the Name of their own native Place. So Vice grows safe, drest in Devotion's Name, Unquestion'd by the Custom house of Fame: Where e'er so much of Sanctity you see, Be more suspicious of hid Villany; Whose 'ever Zeal is than his Neighbours more, If Man think he's a Rogue, if Woman Whore: And such a thing art thou religious Pride, So very Lewd, and yet so sanctify'd. Let now the Dutchess take no further care Of humorous Stallions, let her not dispair, Since her indulgent Stars so kind have been, To send her Bromley and Mazarine; This last doth banish'd Monmouth's place supply, And Wit supplanted is by Letchery. For Monmouth he had Parts, and Wit, and Sense, To all which Mazarine had no pretence; A proof that since such things as he prevail, Her Highness Head is lighter than her Tail. But stay, I Portsmouth almost had forgot, The common Theam of ev'ry rhiming Sot; She'll after railing make us laugh a while, For at her Folly who can chuse but smile? While them who always slight her, great she makes, And so much pains to be despis'd she takes. Goes sauntring with her Highness up to Town, To an old Play, and in the dark come down; Still makes her Court to her as to the Queen, But still is Justled out by Mazarine. So much more Worthy a kind Bawd is thought, Than ever she who her from Exile brought. O Portsmouth, foolish Portsmouth! Not to take The offer the great Sun?d did make, When cringing at thy Feet; e'er Monmouth bow'd, The Golden Calf, that's worshipp'd by the Crowd. But thou for Y?k, who now despises thee, To leave both him and pow'rfull Shaftsbury. If this is all the Policy you know, This all the skill in States you boast of so, How wisely did thy Countrys Laws ordain, Never to let the foolish Women reign. But what must we expect, who daily see Unthinking Charles rul'd by Unthinking thee. Marvil's Ghost. By Mr. Jo. Ayloffe. From the dark Stygian Lake I come, To acquaint poor England with her Doom; Which by the infernal Sisters late, I copied from the Book of Fate: And though the sence may seem disguis'd, 'Tis in these following Lines compriz'd. When England shall forsake the Broom, And take the Thistle in the room; A wanton Fidler shall be led By Fate to shame his Master's Bed; From whence a spurious Race shall grow, Design'd for Britain's overthrow. These, whilst they do possess her Throne, Shall serve all interest but their own; And shall be both in Peace and War, Scourges unto themselves and her. A brace of exil'd Youths, whose Fates Shall pull down Vengeance on those States That harbour'd them abroad, must come Well skill'd in foreign Vices home, And shall their dark designs to hide, With two contesting Churches side; Till with cross persecuting zeal, They have destroy'd the Common-weal: Then Incest, Murder, Perjury, Shall fashionable Vertues be; And Villanies infest this Isle, Shall make the Son of Claudius smile. No Oaths or Sacraments hold good, But what are seal'd with Lust and Blood: Lust, which cold Exile could not tame, Nor Plague nor Fire at home reclaim: For this she shall in Ashes mourn, From Europe's envy turn her scorn, And curse the day that e'er gave Birth To Cæcil, or to Monk on Earth. But as I onwards strove to look, The angry Sister shut the Book, And said, No more, that fickle State Shall know no further of her Fate; Her future fortunes must be hid, Till her known Ills be remedied; And she to those Resentments come, That drove the Tarquins out of Rome; Or such as did in fury turn The Assyran's Palace to his Urn. The true Englishman, 1686. Curs'd be the tim'rous fool, whose feeble mind Is turn'd about with every blast of Wind; Who to self-interest basely does give ear, And suffers Reason to be led by Fear: He only merits a true English Name, Who always says, and does, and is the same; Who dares be honest, though at any rate, And stands prepar'd to meet the worst of Fate: He laughs at Threats, and Flatt'ries does despise, And won't be knavish to be counted wise; No publick storm can his clear Reason blind, Or bad example influence his mind. Let M? like a Cur kick'd out of doors, For his aspiring Projects and Amours, Unman himself to sneak, fawn, cringe and whine, And play the Spaniel, till they let him in; Then, with a grinning and affected Leer, Run his red snout in every Lady's ear. Let a lewd Judge come reeking from a Wench, To vent a wilder Lust upon the Bench; Bawl out the Venom of his rotten Heart, Swell'd up with envy, over-act his part; Condemn the Innocent by Laws ne'er fram'd; And study to be more than doubly damn'd. Let a mean scoundrel Lord (for equal fear Of hanging, or of starving) falsely swear; Let him, whose Knavery and Impudence Is known to every Man's experience, With scraps of broken evidence, contrive To feed, and keep a fainting Plot alive: Nay, though he swears by the same Deities, Whom he has mock'd by Mimmic Sacrifice. Let Rumsey, with his ill-look'd treacherous Face, That swarthy off-spring of a Hellish Race, Whose Mother, big with an intriguing Devil, Brought an Epitome of all that's evil: Let him be perjur'd, and as rashly damn T'eternal Infamy his odious Name. Let Knaves and Fools confound the tott'ring State, And plunge the Subjects in their Monarch's hate; Blinding by false accounts of Men and Things, The most indulgent, and the best of Kings. Let an unthinking hare-brain'd Bigot's zeal, (Not out of any thought of doing well, But in a pure defiance of the Law) In bloody Lines his true Idea draw; That Men may be inform'd, and early see, What such a Man (if once in pow'r) wou'd be: Of Royal Mercy: let him stop the sourse, That Death may have a free and boundless course; Till shivering Ghosts come from their gloomy-Cell, And in dumb Forms a fatal story tell. Let the Court swarm with Pimps, Rogues, Bawds and Whores, And honest Men be all turn'd out of doors; Let Atheism and profaneness there abound, And not an upright Man (God save the King) be found, Let Men of Principles be in disgrace, And mercenary Villains in their place; Let free-born Cities be by Treach'ry won, Lose their just Liberties, and be undone: Let States-men sudden Changes undertake, And make the Government's foundation shake; Till strange tempestuous Murmurs do arise, And show a storm that's gath'ring in the Skies. Let all this happen. Nay, let certain Fate Upon the issue of their Actions wait; If you've a true, a brave undaunted Mind Of English Principles, as well as kind; You'll on the bottom of true Honour stand, Firm as a Rock, unshaken as the Land: So when vast Seas of Trouble 'gainst you beat, They'll break, and force themselves to a Retreat; No Fate, no flattery can e'er controul A steady, resolute, Heroick Soul. On the Young Statesmen. By J. Dryden, 1680. 1 Clarendon had Law and Sense, Clifford was Fierce and Brave, Brennet's grave look was a pretence, And D?y's matchless Impudence Help'd to support the Knave. 2 But Sun?d, God?n, L?y, These will appear such Chits in story, 'Twill turn all Politicks to Jests, To be repeated like John Dory, When Fidlers sing at Feasts. 3 Protect us, mighty Providence, What wou'd these Mad-men have? First, they wou'd bribe us without Pence, Deceive us without common Sense, And without Power enslave. 4 Shall free-born Men in humble awe, Submit to servile shame; Who from consent and custom, draw The same Right to be rul'd by Law Which Kings pretend to reign? 5 The Duke shall wield his conq'ring Sword, The Chancellor make a Speech, The King shall pass his honest word, The pawn'd Revenue Summs afford; And then, come kiss my Breech. VI So have I seen a King on Chess, (His Rooks and Knights withdrawn, His Queen and Bishops in distress) Shifting about, grow less and less, With here and there a Pawn. Portsmouth's Looking-Glass. Methinks I see you newly risen, From your Embriodered Bed and pissing; With studied Mien and much Grimace, Present your self before your Glass, To varnish and rub o're those Graces, You rubb'd off in your Night Embraces: To set your Hair, your Eyes, your Teeth, And all those Powers you conquer with; Lay trains of Love and State-Intrigues, In Powders, Trimmings, and curl'd Wigs: And nicely chuse, and neatly spread, Upon your Cheeks the best French Red. Indeed for Whites none can compare, With those you naturally wear; And though her Highness much delights To laugh and talk about your Whites, I never could perceive your Grace Made use of any for your Face. Here 'tis you practice all your Art, To triumph o're a Monarch's Heart; Tattle and smile, and wink and twink on't, It almost makes me sp? to think on't. These are your master-strokes of Beauty, That keeps poor Rowley to hard Duty: And how can all these be withstood, By frail amorous Flesh and Blood? These are the Charms that have bewitch't him, As if a Conjurer's Rod had switch't him: Made him he knows not what to doe, But loll and fumble here with you. Amongst your Ladies, and his Chitts, At Cards and Council here he sits: Yet minds not how they play at either, Nor cares not when 'tis walking weather: Business and Power he has resign'd, And all things to your mighty Mind. Is there a Minister of State, Or any Treasurer of late, That's fawning and imperious too? He owes his Greatness all to you: And as you see just cause to doe it, You keep him in, or turn him out. Hence 'tis you give us War and Peace, Raise Men, disband them as you please: Take any Pensions, retrench Wages, For Petticoats, and lusty Pages: Contrive and Execute all Laws, Suiting the Judges to the Cause. Learn'd Scroggs and honest Jeffreys, A Faithfull Friend to you who e're is; He made the Jury come in booty, And for your service wou'd hang Doughty. You govern every Council meeting, Making th'Fools do as you think fitting: Your Royal Cully has command, Onely from you at second hand; He does but at the helm appear, Sits there and sleeps while your Slaves steer: And you are the bright Northern Star, By which they guide this Man of War; Yet without doubt they might conduct Him better were you better f? Many begin to think of late His Crown and C?ds have both one date, For as they fall so falls the State. And as his Reins prove loose and weak, The Reigns of Government must break The Impartial Trimmer. 1682. Since there are some that with me see the state Of this declining Isle and mourn its fate, French Councellors and Whores, French Education, Have chang'd our Natures and enslav'd our Nation; There was a time when Barons boldly stood, And spent their Lives for their dear Countries good, Confirm'd our Charter, with a Curse to light On those that shou'd destroy that sacred Right, Which Power with Freedom can so well unite, The hated name of Rebel is not due To him that is to Law and Justice true. Brutus bold part may justly claim Renown, Preferring Right to Friendship and a Crown; For 'twas not Treason then to keep our own. But now the Nation with unusual need Cries help, where is our bold, our English Breed? Popery and Slavery are just at hand, And every Patriot is a S?d. Shaftsbury's gone another Change to try, He hates his Word, yet more the Monarchy. No Head remains our Loyal Cause to grace, For Monmouth is too weak for that high Place: More proper for the Court where he was rais'd, His Dancing envy'd, and his Dressing prais'd; Where still such Folly is so well protected, Those few that han't it are oblig'd t'affect it; For Statesmen, King and Whore, and all have sworn T'advance such Wit and Virtue as their own: Degenerate Rome and Spain deserves to out-brave us, If H?e or H?x can e'er enslave us; Or he that kennels 'twixt his Dogs and Whore, Rul'd by a Woman, he can use no more, Whispers with Knaves, and Jests all day with Fools; Is chid to Counsel like a Boy to School. False to Mankind, and true to him alone Whose Treason still attempts his Life and Crown. Rouse up and cry, no Slavery, no York, And free your King from that devouring Stork; Tho' lull'd with Ease and Safety he appear, And trusts the Reins to him he ought to fear. 'Tis Loyalty indeed to keep the Crown Upon a head that would it self dethrone. This is the case of our unthinking Prince, Wheedled by Knaves, to rule 'gainst common Sense, That we provok'd our Wrongs to justifie, Might in his Reign his Brother's Title try. Live long then Charles secure of those you dread, There's not five Whigs that ever wish'd you dead; For as old Men rarely of Gout complain, That Life prolongs but sooths its wholsome pain. So we with as small cause (God knows) to boast. Bear much with you, rather than with him roast; For if a Subject he such Terror bring, What may we hope from a revengefull King? Both lewd and zealous, stubborn in his Nonsense, He'll sacrifice Mankind to ease his Conscience. O happy Venice, whose good Laws are such, No private Crime the publick Peace can touch. But we most wretched, while two Fools dispute, If Leg or Armstrong shall be absolute. Brajazet to Gloriana, 1683–4. Fair Royal Maid, permit a Youth undone, To tell you how he drew his ruin on; By what degrees he took that passion in, That made him guilty of Promethean Sin, Who from the Gods durst steal Celestial Fire; And tho' with less success I did as high aspire: Ah, why (you Gods) was she of mortal Race, And why 'twixt her and me was there so vast a space? Why was she not above my Passion made? Some Star in Heaven or Goddess of the Shade And yet my haughty Soul could ne'er have bow'd To any Beauty of the common Crowd. None but the Brow that did expect a Crown Could charm or awe me with a Smile or Frown. I liv'd the Envy of the Arcadian Plains, Sought by the Nymphs, and bow'd to by the Swains. Where-e'er I past I swept the Street along, And gather'd round me all the gazing Throng. In numerous Flocks and Herds I did abound, And when I vainly spread my Wishes round, They wanted nothing but my being crown'd: Yet witness all you spightfull Pow'rs above, If my Ambition did not spring from Love: Had you, bright Gloriana, been less fair, Less excellent, less charming than you are, I had my honost Loyalty retain'd, My noble Blood untainted had remain'd; Witness you Graces, witness you sacred Bowers, You shaded River, Banks, and Beds of Flowers, Where the expecting Nymphs have past their Hours; Witness how oft (all careless of their fame) They Languish'd for the Author of their Flame: And when I came reproach'd, my old reserve Ask'd for what Nymph I did my Joys preserve? What sighing Maid was next to be undone, For whom I drest and put my Graces on? And never thought (tho' I feign'd ev'ry proof Of tender Passion) that I lov'd enough. While I with Love's Variety was cloy'd, Or the faint Pleasure like a Dream enjoy'd; 'Twas Gloriana's Eyes my Soul alone, With everlasting Gust could feed upon From her first Bloom my fate I did pursue, And from the tender fragrant Bud I knew, The charming Sweet it promis'd when it blew. They gave me hope, and 'twas in vain I try'd The Beauty from the Princess to divide: For he at once must feel whom you inspire A soft Ambition and a haughty Fire, And hopes the natural Aid of young desire. My unconsidering Passion had not yet Thought your Illustrious Birth for mine too great. 'Twas Love that I pursu'd, that God that leads Sometimes the equall'd Slave to Princes Beds. But oh, I had forgot that Flame must rest In your bright Soul that makes th'Adorer blest; Your sacred Fire alone must you subdue, 'Tis that, not mine, can raise me up to you; Yet if by chance m'ambition meet a stop, With any thought that check'd m'advancing hope: This new one straight wou'd all the rest confound, How every Coxcomb aim'd at being crown'd: The vain young Fool with all his Mother's parts, Who wanted Sense enough for little arts; Whose composition was like Cheder Cheese, (In whose Production all the Town agrees) To whom, from Prince to Priest was added Suff, From great King Charles e'en down to Father Goff; Yet he with vain Pretension lays a claim, To th'glorious title of a Sovereign: And when for Gods such wretched things set up, Was it so great a crime for me to hope? No Laws of God or Man my Vows reprove, There is no Treason in ambitious Love: That sacred Antidote i'th' poyson'd Cup Quells the Contagion of each little drop. I bring no forces but my Sighs and Tears, My Languishments, my soft Complaints and Prayers. Artillery which was never sent in vain, Nor fails, where-e'er it lights, to wound or pain. Here only, here rebated they return, Meeting the solid Armour of your Scorn; Scorn by the Gods, I any thing could bear, The rough Fatigues and Storms of dangerous War; Long Winter Marches or the Summers Heat, Nay ev'n in Battle from the Foe defeat; Scars on this Face, Scars, whose dull recompence Would ne'er attone for what they rob from thence; Scandal of Coward, nay half-witted too, Or siding with the pardon'd rebel Crew: Or ought but Scorn, and yet you must frown on, Your Slave was destin'd thus to be undone; You the avenging Deity appear, And I a Victim fall to all the injur'd fair. On King CHARLES, by the Earl of Rochester, For which he was banish'd the Court and turn'd Mountebank. In the Isle of Great Britain long since famous known, For breeding the best C? in Christendom; There Reigns, and long may he Reign and thrive, The easiest Prince and best bred Man alive: Him no ambition moves to seek Renown, Like the French Fool, to wander up and down, Starving his Subjects, hazarding his Crown. Nor are his high desires above his Strength, His Scepter and his P? are of a Length, And she that plays with one may sway the other, And make him little wiser than his Brother. I hate all Monarchs and the Thrones that they sit on, From the Hector of France to the Cully of Brittain. Poor Prince, thy P? like the Buffoons at Court, It governs thee because it makes thee sport; Tho' Safety, Law, Religion, Life lay on't, 'Twill break through all to make it's way to C?. Restless he rolls about from Whore to Whore, A merry Monarch, scandalous and poor. To Carewell the most dear of all thy Dears, The sure relief of thy declining Years; Oft he bewails his fortune and her fate, To love so well, and to be lov'd so late; For when in her he settles well his T? Yet his dull graceless Buttocks hang an Arse. This you'd believe, had I but time to tell you, The pain it costs to poor laborious Nelly, While she employs Hands, Fingers, Lips and Thighs, E'er she can raise the Member she enjoys. Cato's Answer to Libanius, when he advis'd him to go and consult the Oracle of Jupiter Hamon; translated out of the 9th Book of Lucan, beginning at quid. quin. Labiene jubes, &amp;c. What should I ask my Friends which best would be, To live enslav'd, or thus in Arms die free; If any force can honours price abate, Or Vertue bow beneath the Blows of Fate: If Fortune's Threats a steady Soul disdains; Or if the Joys of Life be worth the pains: If it our Happiness at all import, Whether the foolish Scene be long or short: If when we do but aim at noble ends, The attempt alone immortal Fame attends: If for bad accidents which thickest press, On Merit we should like a good cause less, Or be the fonder of it for success. All this is clear, words in our Minds it strikes, Nor Hamon nor his Priest can deeper fix, Without the Clergies venial Cant and Pains, Gods never frustrate will holds ours in Chains, Nor can we act but what th'all-Wise ordains, Who need no Voice nor perishing Word to awe Our wild Desires, and give his Creatures Law; Whate'er to know or needfull was or fit, In the wise frame of humane Souls is writ, Both what we ought to do and what forbear, He once for all did at our Birth declare; But never did he seek out desert Lands, To bury truth in unfrequented Sands; Or to a corner of the World withdrew Head of a Sect, or partial to a few. Nature's vast Fabrick is his House alone, This Globe his Footstool, and high Heaven his Throne. In Earth, Air, Sea, and in whoe'er excells. In knowing Heads and honest Hearts he dwells. Why seek we then among these barren Sands, In narrow Shrines and Temples built with hands; Him whose dread Presence does all places fill, Or look but in our Reason for his Will? All we e'er saw is God, in all we find Apparent Print of the eternal Mind. Let flatt'ring Fools their course by Prophets steer, And always of the future live in fear: No Oracle or Dream the Crowd is told, Can make me more or less resolv'd or bold; But certain Death which equally on all, Both on the Coward and the Brave must fall; This said, and turning with disdain about, He left scorn'd Hamon to the vulgar Rout. The Lord Lucas's Ghost, 1687. From the blest Regions of eternal day, Where Heaven born Souls imbibe th'immortal Ray, Where Liberty and Innocence reside Free from the Gripes of Tyranny and Pride, Where pious Patriots that have shed their Blood For sacred Truths and for the publick Good, Now rest secure from thence (poor Isle) I come To see thy Sorrows and bewail thy Doom, Thy sore Oppressions and thy peircing Cry, Disturbs our Rest and drowns our Harmany. When stiff-neck'd Israel did their God reject, And in his stead an Idol King erect: Heaven's flaming Sword he brandish'd in his hand, And dreadfull Thunder struck their sinfull Land; Till Penitence atton'd his sinfull Ire, And quench'd the rage of his consuming fire. But this poor Land still feels the dire effect Of his just Wrath who his mild Reign reject. Unhappy Isle, how oft hast thou been curst With f?lish Kings, but this of all's the worst. The Fire, the Plague, the Sword, are dreadfull fiends, This R?l Plague all other far transcends. From him the Fountain all our Mischiefs flows, From him the Fire, from him the War arose. With Rome he plots, Religion to o'erthrow, With France combines to enslave the People too. No Man must near his sacred Person come, Unless he be for Tyranny and Rome. With hardned Face he assaults the frail and fair, Uses his Power the Vertuous to ensnare. With Troops of Vice he conquers Liberty, Depresses Virtue, enthrones Tyranny, Threatens the Coward, fawns upon the Bold, Debauches all with Power or with Gold. Lift up thy Head afflicted Isle, and hear, The time of thy Deliverance draws near, His full blown Crimes will certainly pull down A slow, but sure Destruction of his Crown. His loathed Acts thy freedom's Birth shall cause, Secure Religion, produce wholsome Laws. No more the Poor the Rich one shall devour, No more shall Right yield to oppressive Power: No more shall Rapine make the Country groan, Nor civil Wars shall reign within the Town: The Iron Scepter, and the Tyrant's Hand, Shall cease henceforth to bruise thy happy Land. Rome's Hocus Pocus Ministers no more Shall cause Mankind their jugling Priests t'adore: Thy Learned Clergy shall confound them all, And they, like Ely's Sons, unpitied fall. Dark Mists of Errors then must fly away, And Hell's Delusions shrink from the bright day. Truth's sacred Light in full abundance shall Upon thy Teachers and thy People fall. So when th'eternal Son was born to die For all the World, the lesser Gods did fly; His bright appearance struck their Prophets domb, And Death like silence did their Gods intomb. The tunefull Spheres with Hallelujahs rung, Heaven's mighty Host with Man one Chorus sung. Ne'er fading Glory unto God above, Peace upon Earth, to Men eternal Love. Thus the Creation showted with one Voice, Thus Heaven and Earth did at his Birth rejoyce: And thus shall all repeat this Song again, When upon Earth he shall begin to reign. But this lov'd Isle shall be the chosen place, Here shall the King of Kings begin his race: Judea was his Cradle and the Tomb, Britain shall be his Throne in time to come. An EPITAPH. Algernoon Sidney fills this Tomb; An Atheist, by declaiming Rome: A Rebel bold, by striving still To keep the Laws above the Will; And hindring those would pull them down, To leave no limits to a Crown: Crimes damn'd by Church and Government, Oh! whither must his Soul be sent? Of Heaven it must needs despair, If that the Pope be turn-key there; And Hell can ne'er it entertain, For there is all Tyrannick Reign, And Purgatory's such a Pretence As ne'er deceiv'd a Man of Sense: Where goes it then? Where 't ought to go, Where Pope and Devil have nought to do. The Brazen Head. What strepitantious Noise is it that sounds From raised Banks, or from the lower Grounds? From hollow Caverns, Labyrinths from far, Threatning Confusions of a dreadfull War? What dismal Cries of People in Despair, Fill the vast Region of the troubled Air? The Tune of Horror, or of what's as strange, That strikes uneven like a World of Change, With such a bold Surprize attacks my Sense, Beyond the Power of Counsel or Defence? But tho' blind Fortune rolls her turning Wheel With a perpetual Motion, who can feel This Surge of Fate, push'd on with Fire and Steel? You precious Moments of serener Days! When many Victories enlarg'd my Praise, And all things ran in a most easie Stream, Back unto me their Ocean and Supreme. Are you all vanish'd by the sudden Fright, And left m' encompass'd with a dismal Night? By my own Subjects in suspicion held, Murmurings as bad, as if they had Rebell'd? You all controuling Powers of things above! Who easier Dictates guide the World by Love! Avert th'impendent Miseries, and show Us Earthly Gods to govern here below. The Answer. 'Tis well you've thought upon the chiefest Cause, Change nothing of Religion nor the Laws. Let the great Monarch this good Motto wear, Not only in his Arms but every where. Integer Vitæ, is my whole Defence, Scelerisque purus, a frost strong defence; Non egec Mauri, that no Forces need, Jaculis nec Arcu, which contentions breed: Nec venenatis gravida Sagittis Pharetra, to make Loyal his own Cities. Upon the Execrable Murther of the Right Honourable Arthur Earl of Essex. Mortality wou'd be too frail to hear, How ESSEX fell, and not dissolve with fear; Did not more generous Rage take off the Blow, And by his Blood the steps to Vengeance show. The Tow'r was for the Tragedy design'd, And to be slaughter'd he is first confin'd: As fetter'd Victims to the Altar go. But why must noble ESSEX perish so? Why with such Fury drag'd into his Tomb, Murther'd by Slaves, and sacrific'd to Rome? By Stealth they kill, and with a secret Stroke Silence that Voice, which charm'd whene'er it spoke. The bleeding Orifice o'erflow'd the Ground, More like some mighty Deluge than a Wound. Through the large space his Blood and Vitals glide, And his whole Body might have past beside. The reeking Crimson swell'd into a Flood, And stream'd a second time in Capel's Blood. He's in his Son again to Death pursu'd, An instance of the high'st ingratitude. They then malitious Stratagems employ, With Life, his dear Honour to destroy; And make his Fame extinguish with his Breath, And act beyond the Cruelties of Death. Here Murther is in all its shapes complete, As Lines united in their Centre meet; Form'd by the blackest Politicks of Hell; Was Cain so de'vlish when his Brother fell? He that contrives, or his own Fate desires, Wants Courage, and for fear of Death expires; But mighty ESSEX was in all things brave, Neither to Hope, nor to Despair, a Slave. He had a Soul too Innocent and Great, To fear, or to anticipate his Fate: Yet their exalted Impudence and Guilt, Charge on himself the precious Blood they spilt. So were the Protestants some Years agoe, Destroy'd in Ireland without a Foe. By their own barbarous Hands the Mad-men dye, And massacre themselves, they know not why: Whilst the kind Irish howl to see the Gore, And pious Catholicks their Fate deplore. If you refuse to trust erroneous Fame, Royal Mac-Ninny will confirm the same. We have lost more in injur'd Capel's Heir, Than the poor Bankrupt Age can e'er repair. Nature indulg'd him so, that there we saw All the choice Strokes her steady Hand cou'd draw. He the Old English Glory did revive, In him we had Plantaganets alive. Grandeur and Fortune, and a vast Renown, Fit to support the Lustre of a Crown. All these in him were potently conjoyn'd, But all was too ignoble for his Mind: Wisdom and Vertue, properties Divine, Those, God-like ESSEX, were entirely thine. In this great Name he's still preserv'd alive, And will to all succeeding Times survive. With just Progression, as the constant Sun Doth move, and through its bright Ecliptick run. For whilst his Dust does unextinguish'd lye, And his blest Soul is soar'd above the Sky, Fame shall below his parted Breath supply. An Essay upon Satyr By J. Dr?en, Esquire. How dull, and how insensible a Beast Is Man, who yet would Lord it o're the rest? Philosophers and Poets vainly strove In every Age the lumpish Mass to move: But those were Pedants when compar'd with these, Who know not only to instruct, but please. Poets alone found the delightfull way, Mysterious Morals gently to convey In charming Numbers; so that as men grow Pleas'd with their Poems, they grew wiser too. Satyr has always shone among the rest, And is the boldest way, if not the best, To tell men freely of their foulest Faults, To laugh at their vain Deeds, and vainer Thoughts. In Satyr too the Wise took different ways, To each deserving its peculiar praise. Some did all Folly with just sharpness blame, Whilst others laugh'd and scorn'd them into shame. But of these two, the last succeeded best, (As Men aim rightest when they shoot in jest:) Yet if we may presume to blame our Guides, And censure those who censure all besides; In other things they justly are preferr'd, In this alone methinks the Ancients err'd; Against the grossest Follies they disclaim, Hard they pursue, but hunt ignoble Game. Nothing is easier than such blots to hit, And 'tis the Talent of each vulgar Wit; Besides, 'tis labour lost; for who would preach Morals to Armstrong, or dull Aston teach? 'Tis being devout at Play, wise at a Ball, Or bringing Wit and Friendship to Whitehall; But with sharp Eyes those nicer Faults to find, Which lie obscurely in the wisest Mind; That little speck, which all the rest does spoil, To wash off that would be a noble toil; Beyond the loose-writ Libels of this Age, Or the forc'd Scenes of our declining Stage; Above all Censure too, each little Wit Will be so glad to see the greater hit: Who judging better, though concern'd the most, Of such Correction will have cause to boast. In such a Satyr all would seek a share, And every Fool will fancy he is there. Old Story-tellers too must pine and dye, To see their antiquated Wit laid by; Like her who miss'd her Name in a Lampoon, And grieve to find her self decay'd so soon; No common Coxcomb must be mention'd here, Not the dull train of dancing Sparks appear; Nor fluttering Officers, who never fight; Of such a wretched Rabble who would write? Much less half Wits, that's more against our Rules; For they are Fops, the other are but Fools. Who would not be as silly as Dunbarr? As dull as Monmouth, rather than Sir Carr? The cunning Courtier should be slighted too, Who with dull Knavery makes so much adoe; Till the shrewd Fool, by thriving too too fast, Like Æsop's Fox, becomes a Prey at last: Nor shall the Royal Mistresses be nam'd, Too ugly, or too easie to be blam'd; With whom each rhyming Fool keeps such a pother, They are as common that way as the other: Yet santering Ch?s between his beastly Brace, Meets with dissembling still in either place, Affected Humour or a painted Face In Loyal Libels we have often told him, How one has gilted him, the other sold him. How that affects to laugh, how this to weep; But who can rail so long as he can sleep? Was ever Prince by two at once mis-led, False, foolish, old, ill-natur'd, and ill-bred? Earnely and Ayles?ry, with all that race Of busie Block-heads shall have here no place; At Council set as foils on D?'s score, To make that great false Jewel shine the more; Who all that while was thought exceeding wise, Only for taking pains and telling lies. But there's no medling with such nauseous Men, Their very Names have tyr'd my lazy Pen; 'Tis time to quit their company, and chuse Some fitter subject for a sharper Muse. First, let's behold the merriest Man alive, Against his careless Genius vainly strive; Quit his dear Ease, some deep design to lay, 'Gainst a set time, and then forget the day: Yet he will laugh at his best Friends, and be Just as good Company as Nokes and Lee. But when he aims at Reason or at Rule, He turns himself the best in ridicule. Let him at business ne'er so earnest sit, Shew him but Mirth, and bait that Mirth with Wit; That shadow of a Jest shall be enjoy'd, Though he left all Mankind to be destroy'd: So Cat transform'd sat gravely and demure, Till Mouse appear'd, and thought himself secure; But soon the Lady had him in her Eye, And from her Friend did just as odly fly; Reaching above our Nature does no good, We must fall back to our old flesh and blood. As by our little Matchiavel we find (That nimblest Creature of the busie kind) His Limbs are crippled, and his Body shakes, Yet his hard Mind, which all this bustle makes, No pity of its poor Companion takes. What Gravity can hold from laughing out, To see that drag his feeble Legs about; Like Hounds ill coupled, Jowler lugs him still Through Hedges, Ditches, and through all that's ill! 'Twere Crime in any man but him alone, To use a Body so, though 'tis ones own: Yet this false Comfort never gives him o're, That whilst he creeps his vigorous thoughts can soar: Alas, that soaring to those few that know, Is but a busie groveling here below. So Men in Rapture think they mount the Sky, Whilst on the Ground th'intransed Wretches lye; So modern Fops have fancied they could fly: Whilst 'tis their Heads alone are in the Air, And for the most part building Castles there; As the new Earl with Parts deserving praise, And wit enough to laugh at his own ways; Yet loses all soft days and sensual nights, Kind Nature checks, and kinder Fortune slights; Striving against his quiet all he can, For the fine Notion of a busie Man; And what is that at best but one whose Mind, Is made to tire himself and all Mankind: For Ireland he would go, faith let him reign, For if some odd fantastick Lord would fain Carry in Trunks, and all my drudgery do, I'll not only pay him but admire him too; But is there any other Beast that lives, Who his own harm so wittily contrives? Will any Dog that has his Teeth and Stones, Refin'dly leave his Bitches and his Bones To turn a Wheel? and bark to be employ'd, While Venus is by rival Dogs enjoy'd: Yet this fond Man to get a Statesman's Name, Forfeits his Friends, his Freedom and his Fame. Though Satyr nicely writ, no humour stings But those who merit praise in other things; Yet we must needs this one exception make, And break our rules for folly Tropos sake; Who was too much despis'd to be accus'd, And therefore scarce deserves to be abus'd; Rais'd only by his mercenary Tongue, From railing smoothly, and from reasoning wrong: As Boys on Holy-days let loose to play, Lay waggish Traps for Girls that pass that way; Then shout to see in dirt and deep distress, Some silly Cit in flowr'd foolish Dress; So have I mighty satisfaction found, To see his tinsel reason on the Ground: To see the florid Fool despis'd (and know it) By some who scarce have words enough to show it; (For sence sits silent, and condemns for weaker The finer; nay sometimes the wittiest Speaker) But 'tis prodigious so much Eloquence Should be acquired by such a little Sense; For words and wit did anciently agree, And Tully was no Fool though this man be: At Bar abusive, on the Bench unable, Knave on the Woolsack, Fop at Council-Table. These are the Grievances of such Fools as wou'd, Be rather wise than honest, great than good. Some other kind of Wits must be made known, Whose harmless Errors hurt themselves alone; Excess of Luxury they think can please, And laziness call loving of their ease: To live dissolv'd in pleasures still they feign, Though their whole Life's but intermitting pain: So much of Surfeits, Head-aches, Claps are seen, We scarce perceive the little time between: Well-meaning men who make this gross mistake, And pleasure lose only for pleasures sake; Each pleasure has its price, and when we pay Too much of pain we squander Life away. Thus D?et purring like a thoughtfull Cat, Married but wiser, Puss ne'er thought of that: And first he worried her with railing rhime, Like Pembrook's Mastives at his kindest time; Then for one night sold all his slavish Life, A teeming Widow but a barren Wife; Suckl'd by contract of such a fulsome toad, He lugg'd about the matrimonial load; Till Fortune blindly kind as well as he, Has ill restor'd him to his liberty; Which he would use in all his sneaking way, Drinking all night, and dozing all the day; Dull as Ned Howard, whom his brisker Times, Had fam'd for dulness in malicious Rhimes. Mul?ve had much adoe to scape the snare, Though learn'd in those ill Arts that cheat the Fair: For after all his vulgar Marriage-mocks, With Beauty dazled Numps was in the Stocks; Deluded Parents dry'd their weeping Eyes, To see him catch his Tartar for his Prize: Th'impatient Town waited the wisht for change, And Cuckolds smil'd in hopes of sweet revenge; Till Petworth Plot made us with sorrow see, As his Estate his Person too was free: Him no soft thoughts, no gratitude could move, To Gold he fled from Beauty and from Love; Yet failing there he keeps his freedom still, Forc'd to live happily against his will: 'Tis not his fault if too much wealth and power, Break not his boasted quiet every hour. And little Sid?y for Simile renown'd, Pleasures has always sought but never found: Though all his Thoughts on Wine and Women fall, His are so bad sure he ne'er thinks at all. The Flesh he lives upon is rank and strong, His Meat and Mistresses are kept too long; But sure we all mistake this pious Man, Who mortifies his Person all he can: What we uncharitably take for Sin, Are only Rules of this old Capuchin; For never Hermit under grave pretence, Has liv'd more contrary to common sense; And 'tis a miracle we may suppose, No nastiness offends his skilfull Nose; Which from all stink can with peculiar art Extract Perfume, and Essence, from a F?t; Expecting Supper is his great delight, He toils all day but to be drunk at night: Then o're his Cups this Night-bird chirping sits, Till he takes Hewet, and Jack Hall for Wits. Roch?r I despise for his meer want of wit, Though thought to have a Tail and Cloven Feet; For while he mischief means to all Mankind, Himself alone the ill effects does find; And so like Witches justly suffers shame, Whose harmless malice is so much the same. False are his words, affected is his wit, So often he does aim, so seldom hit; To every face he cringes while he speaks, But when the back is turn'd the head he breaks. Mean in each Action, lewd in every Limb, Manners themselves are mischievous in him: A proof that chance alone makes every Creature, A very Killig?w without good Nature. For what a Bessus has he always liv'd, And his own Kickings notably contriv'd: For (there's the folly that's still mixt with fear) Cowards more blows than any Hero bear; Of fighting Sparks some may her pleasures say, But 'tis a bolder thing to run away: The World may well forgive him all his ill, For every fault does prove his penance still: Falsly he falls into some dangerous noose, And then as meanly labours to get loose; A Life so infamous is better quitting, Spent in base injury and low submitting. I'd like to have left out his Poetry; Forgot by all almost as well as me. Sometimes he has some humour, never wit, And if it rarely, very rarely hit, 'Tis under so much nasty rubbish laid, To find it out's the Cinder-womans trade; Who for the wretched remnants of a fire, Must toil all day in ashes and in mire: So lewdly dull his idle Works appear, The wretched Texts deserve no Comments here; Where one poor Thought sometimes left all alone, For a whole Page of dulness to attone: 'Mongst forty bad, one tolerable line, Without expression, fancy, or design. How vain a thing is Man, and how unwise, Even he who would himself the most despise; I who so wise and humble seem to be, Now my own Vanity and Pride can't see. While the World's nonsense is so sharply shewn, We pull down others but to raise our own; That we may Angels seem, we paint them Elves, And are but Satyrs to set up our selves. I who have all this while been finding fault, Even with my Master, who first Satyr taught; And did by that describe the Task so hard, It seems stupendious and above reward. Now labour with unequal force to climb That lofty Hill, unreacht by former time; Tis just that I should to the bottom fall, Learn to write well, or not to write at all. Upon an undeserving and ungratefull Mistress, whom he could not help loving. Being a Paraphrastical Translation of Ovid's Tenth Elegy. Lib. 3. Amorum. I have too long endur'd her guilty Scorn, Too long her falseness my fond Love has born; My freedom and my wits at length I claim; Be gone base Passion, dye unworthy flame; My Life's sole torment and my Honour's stain, Quit this tir'd Heart and end the lingring pain. I have resolv'd I'le be my self once more Long banish'd Reason to her right restore, And throw off Love's tyrannick sway, that still encroaching power. My growing shame I see at last, tho' late, And my past Follies both despise and hate: Hold out my Heart, nor let her Beauty move, Be constant in thy Anger as thy Love: My present pains shall give thee future ease, As bitter Potions cure, tho' they displease. 'Tis for this end, for freedom more assur'd, I have so long such shamefull Chains endur'd. Like a scorn'd Slave before her door I lay, And proud repulses suffer'd every day; Without complaining, banish'd from her sight, On the cold ground I spent the tedious Night; While some glad Rival in her Arms did lye, Glutted with Love and surfeited with Joy. Thence have I seen the tir'd Adulterer come, Dragging a weak exhausted Carkass home. And yet this Curse a Blessing I esteem, Compar'd with that of being seen by him; By him descry'd attending in the Street, May my foes only such Disgraces meet. What toyl and time has this false Woman cost? How much of unreturning Youth has for her sake been lost? How long did I, where fancy led or fate? Unthank'd, unminded, on her Rambles wait; Her Steps, her Looks were still by mine pursu'd, And watch'd by me she charm'd the gazing Crowd. My diligent Love and over-fond Desire, Has been the means to kindle others Fire. What need I mention every little Wrong, Or curse the softness of her soothing Tongue. The private Love-signs that in publick pass, Between her and some common staring Ass. The Coquet Art her faithless Heart allows, Or tax her with a thousand broken Vows: I hear she's sick, and with wild hast I run, Officious Hast, and Visit importune. Entring, my Rival on her Bed I see, The politick Sickness only was to me. With this and more oft has my Love been try'd, Some other Coxcomb let her now provide, To bear her jilting and maintain her pride; My batter'd Bark has reach'd the Port at last, Nor fears again the Billows it has past. Cease your soft Oaths and that still ready show'r, Those once dear words have lost their charming pow'r. In vain you flatter, I am now no more, That easie Fool you found me heretofore. Anger and Love a doubtfull fight maintain, Each strives by turns my staggering heart to gain: But what can long against Lov's force contend, My Love I fear will conquer in the end; I'll do what e'er I can to hate you still, And if I Love, know 'tis against my Will. So the Bull hates the Ploughman's Yoke to wear, Yet what he hates, his stubborn Neck must bear. Her manners oft my Indignation raise, But straight her Beauty the short storm allays. Her Life I loath, her Person I adore; Much I contemn her, but I love her more. Both with her and without her I'm in pain, And rage to lose, what I should blush to gain: Uncertain, yet at what my wishes aim; Loath to abandon Love or part with Fame That Angel-form ill suits a form all sin; Ah! be less fair without, or more within. When these soft Smiles my yielding Powers invade, In vain I call her Vices to my aid; Tho' now disdaining the disguise of Art, In my esteem her Conduct claims no part, Her Face a natural right has to my Heart. No Crime's so black as to deform her Eyes, Those Clouds must scatter when these Suns shall rise. Enough, fair Conqueror, the day's your own, See at your Feet, Love's vanquish'd Rebel thrown; By these dear Joys, (Joys dear tho' they are past) When in the kindest Links of Love we held each other fast; By th'injur'd Gods your false Oaths did prophane By all those Beauties that support and feed your proud disdain; By that lov'd Face from the whole Sex Elect, To which I all my Vows and Pray'rs direct, And equal with a Power divine respect: By every feature of a turn so fine, And by those Arms that charm and dazle mine. Spare from new triumphs, cherish without art, This over-faithfull, this too tender Heart: A Heart that was respectfull while it strove, But yielding is all blind impetuous Love: Live as you please, torment me as you will, Still are you fair, and I must love you still. Think only, if with just and clement Reign, A willing Subject you wou'd chuse to gain, Or drag a conquer'd Vassal in a Chain; But to what ever Conduct you incline, Do suffer, be what my worse fears divine, You are, you ought, you must, you shall be mine. Reason for ever, the vain strife give o'er, Thy cruel Wisdom I can bear no more; Let me indulge this one soft Passion's rule, Curb vexing Sense and be a happy Fool; With full spread Sails the tempting Gale obey, That down Lov's Current drives me fast away. The Town Life. Once how I doated on this Jilting Town, Thinking no Heaven was out of London known; Till I her Beauties artificial found, Her Pleasure's but a short and giddy round; Like one who has his Phillis long enjoy'd, Grown with the fulsom repetition cloy'd; Love's Mists then vanish from before his Eyes, And all the Ladies Frailties he descries: Quite surfeited with Joy, I now retreat To the fresh Air, a homely Country Seat, Good Hours, Books, harmless Sports, &amp; wholsom Meat. And now at last I have chose my proper Sphere, Where Men are plain and rustick, but sincere. I never was for Lies nor Fawning made, But call a Wafer Bread, and Spade a Spade. I tell what merits got Lord—his place, And laugh at marry'd M?ve to his Face. I cannot vere with ev'ry change of State, Nor flatter Villains, tho' at Court they're great: Nor will I prostitute my Pen for Hire, Praise Cromwell, damn him, write the Spanish Fryar: A Papist now, if next the Turk should reign, Then piously transverse the Alcoran. Methinks I hear one of the Nation cry, Be Christ, this is a Whiggish Calumny, All Virtues are compriz'd in Loyalty. Might I dispute with him, I'de change his Note, I'de silence him, that is, he'd cutt my Throat. This powerfull way of reasoning never mist, None are so positive but then desist, As I will, e're it come to that extreme; Our Folly, not our Misery is our Theam. Well may we wonder what strange Charm, what Spell, What mighty Pleasures in this London dwell, That Men renounce their Ease, Estates and Fame, And drudge it here to get a Fopling's Name? That one of seeming sense advanc'd in years, Like a Sir Courtly Nice in Town appears: Others exchange their Land for tawdry Cloaths, And will in spight of Nature pass for Beauxs. Indulgent Heaven, who ne'er made ought in vain, Each Man for something proper did ordain; Yet most against their Genius blindly run, The wrong they chuse, and what they're made for shun. Thus Ar?n thinks for State affairs he's fit; Hewit for Ogling, C?ly for a Wit: But 'tis in vain, so wise, these Men to teach, Besides the King's learn'd Priests should only preach. We'll see how Sparks the tedious day employ, And trace them in their warm pursuit of Joy; If they get drest (with much ado) by Noon, In quest of Beauty to the Mall they run, Where (like young Boys) with Hat in hand they try To catch some flutt'ring gawdy Butterfly. Thus Gray pursues the Lady with a Face, Like forty more, and with the same success, Whose jilting Conduct in her Beauty's spite, Looses her fame, and get's no pleasure by't. The secret Joys of an Intrigue she slights, And in an Equipage of Fools delights So some vain Heroes for a vain command, Forfeit their Conscience, Liberty and Land. But see high Mass is done, in Crowds they go, What, all these Irish, and Mall Howard too? 'Tis very late, to Lockets let's away, The Lady Frances comes, I will not stay. Expecting Dinner, to discourse they fall, Without respect of morals censuring all: The Nymph they lov'd, the Friend they hug'd before, He's a vain Coxcomb, she's a common Whore: No obligation can their Jeasts prevent; Wit, like unruly Wind in Bowels pent, Torments the bearer till he gives it vent; Tho' this offends the Ear as that the Nose, No matter, 'tis for Ease and out it goes. But what they talk (too nauseous to rehearse) I leave for the late Ballad-writers Verse. After a dear bought Meal they hast away, To a desert of Ogling at the Play: What's here which in the Box's front I see, Deform'd old Age, deseases Infamy. W?k, N?th, Paget, Hinton, Martin, Willis, And that Epitome of Lewdness, Elly's. I'll not turn that way, but observe the Play, Pox, 'tis a tragick Farce of Banks to day: Besides some Irish Wits the Pit invade With a worse Din than Cat-call Serenade. I must be gone, let's to Hide Park repair, If not good company, we'll find good Air: Here with affected Bow and Side-Glass look, The self-conceited Fool is easily took. There comes a Spark with six in Tarsels drest, Charming the Ladies Hearts with dint of Beast: Like Scullers on the Thames with frequent bow, They labour, tugg, and in their Coaches row, To meet some fair one, still they wheel about, Till she retires, and then they hurry out. But next we'll visit where the Beauxs in order come, ('Tis yet too early for the drawing-room) Here Nowels and Olivia's abound; But one plain Manly is not to be found: Flattr'ng the present, the absent they abuse, And vent their Spleen and Lies, pretending News: Why, such a Lady's pale and wou'd not dance; This to the Country gone, and that to France: Whose marry'd, slip'd away, or mist at Court, Others Misfortunes thus afford them sport: A new Song is produc'd, the Author guest, The Verses and the Poet made a Jest. Live Laureat E?er, in whom we see, The English can excell Antiquity. Dryden writes Epick, Wosley Odes in vain, Virgil and Horace still the chief maintain: He with his matchless Poems has alone, Bavius and Mevius in their way out-done. But now for Cards, and play they all propose, While I who never in good Breeding lose, Who cannot civilly sit still and see The Ladies pick my Purse and laugh at me, Pretending earnest business drive to Court, Where those who can do nothing else resort. The English must not seek preferment there, For Mack's and O's all places destin'd are. No more we'll send our Youth to Paris now, French Principles and Breeding once wou'd do: They for Improvement must to Ireland sail, The Irish Wit and Language now prevail. But soft my Pen, with care this Subject touch, Stop where you are, you soon may write too much. Quite weary with the hurry of the day, I to my peacefull home direct my way; While some in Hack and Habit of Fatigue, May have (but oft pretend) a close Intrigue; Others more open to the Tavern scower, Calling for Wine, and every Man his Whore, As safe as those with quality perhaps, For N?rgh says great Ladies can give Claps: Somewhere they're kept, and many where they keep, Most see an easie Mistress e'er they Sleep. Thus Sparks may dress, dance, play, write, fight, get drunk, But all the mighty Pother ends in Punk. A Satyr on the modern Translators. Odi imitatores servum pecus, &amp;c. Since the united cunning of the Stage, Has balk'd the hireling Drudges of the Age: Since Betterton of late so thrifty's grown, Revives old Plays, or wisely acts his own: Thum'd Rider with a Catalogue of Rhimes, Makes the compleatest Poet of our Times: Those who with nine months toil had spoil'd a Play, In hopes of Eating at a full Third day, Justly despairing longer to sustain A craving Stomach from an empty Brain, Have left Stage-practice, chang'd their old Vocations, Atoning for bad Plays, with worse Translations, And like old Sternhold with laborious spite, Burlesque what nobler Muses better write: Thus while they for their Causes only seem To change the Channel, they corrupt the Stream. So breaking Vintners to increase their Wine, With nauseous Drugs debauch the generous Vine: So barren Gipsies for recruit are said, With Strangers Issue to maintain the Trade; But lest the fair Bantling should be known, A daubing Walnut makes him all their own. In the head of this Gang too John Dryden appears, But to save the Town-censure and lessen his Fears, Join'd with a Spark whose Title makes me civil, For Scandalum Magnatum is the Devil: Such mighty Thoughts from Ovid's Letters flow, That the Translation is a work for two; Who in one Copy joyn'd their shame have shewn, Since T?e could spoil so many, though alone: My Lord I thought so generous would prove, To scorn a Rival in affairs of Love: But well he knew his teeming pangs were vain, Till Midwife Dryden eas'd his labouring Brain; And that when part of Hudibras's Horse Jogg'd on, the other would not hang an Arse; So when fleet Jowler hears the joyfull halloo, He drags his sluggish Mate, and Tray must follow. But how could this learn'd brace employ their time? One construed sure, while th'other pump'd for Rhime: Or it with these, as once at Rome, succeeds, The Bibulus subscribes to Cæsar's Deeds: This, from his Partners Acts, ensures his Name, Oh sacred thirst of everlasting Fame! That could defile those well cut Nails with Ink, And make his Honour condescend to think: But what Excuse, what Preface can atone, For Crimes which guilty Bayes has singly done? Bayes, whose Rose Alley Ambuscade injoyn'd, To be to Vices which he practic'd kind, And brought the venome of a spitefull Satyr, To the safe innocence of a dull Translator. Bayes, who by all the Club was thought most fit To violate the Mantuan Prophet's wit, And more debauch what loose Lucretius writ. When I behold the rovings of his Muse, How soon Assyrian Ointments she would lose For Diamond Buckles sparkling at their Shoes. When Virgil's height is lost, when Ovid soars, And in Heroics Canace deplores Her Follies, louder than her Father roars, I'd let him take Almanzor for his Theme; In lofty Verses make Maximin blaspheme, Or sing in softer Airs St. Katharine's Dream. Nay, I could hear him damn last Ages Wit, And rail at Excellence he ne'er can hit; His Envy shou'd at powerfull Cowley rage, And banish Sense with Johnson from the Stage: His Sacrilege should plunder Shakespear's Urn, With a dull Prologue make the Ghost return To bear a second Death, and greater pain, While the Fiend's words the Oracle prophane; But when not satisfy'd with Spoils at home, The Pyrate wou'd to foreign Borders roam; May he still split on some unlucky Coast, And have his Works, or Dictionary lost; That he may know what Roman Authors mean, No more than does our blind Translatress Behn. The Female Wit, who next convicted stands, Nor for abusing Ovid's Verse but Sand's: She might have learn'd from the ill borrow'd Grace, (Which little helps the ruine of her Face) That Wit, like Beauty, triumphs o're the Heart, When more of Nature's seen and less of Art: Nor strive in Ovid's Letters to have shown, As much of Skill, as Lewdness in her own: Then let her from the next inconstant Lover, Take a new Copy for a second Rover: Describe the cunning of a Jilting Whore, From the ill Arts her self has us'd before; Thus let her write, but Paraphrase no more. R?mer to Crambo privilege does claim, Not from the Poet's Genius, but his Name; Which Providence in contradiction meant, Though he Predestination cou'd prevent, And with bold dulness translate Heavens intent. Rash Man! we paid thee Adoration due, That ancient Criticks were excell'd by you: Each little Wit to your Tribunal came To hear their doom, and to secure their Fame: But for Respect you servilely sought Praise, Slighted the Umpire's Palm to court the Poet's Bayes; While wise Reflexions and a grave Discourse, Declin'd to Zoons a River for a Horse. So discontented Pemberton withdrew, From sleeping Judges to the noisie Crew; Chang'd awefull Ermin for a servile Gown, And to an humble fawning smooth'd his frown: The Simile will differ here indeed; You cannot versify, though he can plead. To painfull Creech my last Advice descends, That he and Learning would at length be Friends; That he'd command his dreadfull Forces home, Not be a second Hannibal to Rome. But since no Counsel his Resolves can bow, Nor may thy fate, O Rome, resist his Vow; Debarr'd from Pens as Lunaticks from Swords, He shou'd be kept from waging war with Words. Words which at first like Atoms did advance, To the just measure of a tunefull Dance, And jumpt to Form, as did his Worlds, by chance. This pleas'd the Genius of the vicious Town; The Wits confirm'd his Labours with renown, And swear the early Atheist for their own. Had he stopt here—But ruin'd by Success, With a new Spawn he fill'd the burthen'd Press, Till, as his Volumes swell'd, his Fame grew less. So Merchants flattered with increasing Gain, Still tempt the falshood of the doubtfull Main; So the first running of the lucky Dice, Does eager Bully to new Bets intice; Till Fortune urges him to be undone, And Ames-Ace loses what kind Sixes wone. Witness this Truth Lucretia's wretched Fate, Which better have I heard my Nurse relate; The Matron suffers violence again, Not Tarquin's Lust so vile as Chreech's Pen; Witness those heaps his Midnight Studies raise, Hoping to rival Ogilby in Praise: Both writ so much, so ill; a doubt might rise, Which with most Justice might deserve the Prize; Had not the first the Town with Cutts appeas'd, And where the Poem fail'd the Picture pleas'd. Wits of a meaner rank I wou'd rehearse, But will not plague your Patience nor my Verse: In long oblivion may they happy lie, And with their Writings may their Folly die. Now why should we poor Ovid yet pursue, And make his very Book an Exile too, In words more barbarous than the place he knew? If Virgil labour'd not to be translated, Why suffers he the only thing he hated? Had he foreseen some ill officious Tongue, Wou'd in unequal Strains blaspheme his Song; Nor Prayers, nor Force, nor Fame shou'd e'er prevent The just Performance of his wise intent: Smiling h'had seen his martyr'd Work expire, Nor live to feel more cruel Foes than Fire. Some Fop in Preface may those Thefts excuse, That Virgil was the draught of Homer's Muse: That Horace's by Pindar's Lyre was strung, By the great Image of whose Voice he sung; They found the Mass, 'tis true, but in their Mould They purg'd the drossy Oar to current Gold: Mending their Pattern, they escap'd the Curse, Yet had they not writ better, they'd writ worse. But when we bind the Lyric up to rhime, And lose the Sense to make the Poem chime: When from their Flocks we force Sicilian Swains, To ravish Milk-maids in our English Plains; And wandring Authors, e'er they touch our shore, Must, like our Locust Hugonots, be poor. I'de bid th'importing Club thier pains forbear, And traffick in our own, tho' homely ware, Whilst from themselves the honest Vermin spin, I'de like the Texture, tho' the Web be thin; Nay, take Crown's Plays, because his own, for wit; And praise what D'urfey, not translating, writ. The Parliament House to be Lett, 1678. 1 Here's a House to be let, For C?, S?d swore, On Portsmouth's bare Arse, He wou'd shut up the Door. 2 Inquire at the Lodgings Next Door to the Pope, At Duke Lauderdale's Head, With a Cravat of Rope. 3 And there you will hear How next he will let it, If you pay the old Price, You may certainly get it. 4 He holds it in Tail, From his Father, who fast Did keep it long shut, But 'twas open'd at last. Advice to Apollo, 1678. The attribution of this poem is questionable. I've heard the Muses were still soft and kind, To Malice Foes, to gentle Love inclin'd; And that Parnassus Hill was fresh and gay, Crown'd still with Flowers as in the fairest May: That Helicon with Pleasures charm'd the Soul, Could Anger tame, and restless Care controul: That bright Apollo still delights in Mirth, Chearing (each welcome day) the drowsie Earth; Then whence comes Satyr, is it Poetry? O great Apollo, God of Harmony! Far be't from thee, this cruel Art t'inspire, Then strike these Wretches who thus dare aspire, To tax thy gentleness, making thee seem Malicious as their Thought, harsh as their Theme. First, strike Sir Carr, that Knight o'th' wither'd Face, Who (for th'reversion of a Poet's place) Waits on Melpomene, and sooths her Grace; That angry Miss alone he strives to please, For fear the rest should teach him Wit and Ease, And make him quit his lov'd laborious Walks, When sad or silent o'er the Room he stalks, And strives to write as wisely as he talks. Next with a gentle Dart strike Dryden down, Who but begins to aim at the Renown Bestow'd on Satyrists, and quits the Stage, To lash the witty Follies of the Age. Strike him but gently that he may return, Write Plays again, and his past Follies mourn. He had better make Almanzor give offence In fifty Lines without one word of Sense, Than thus offend and wittily deserve, What will ensue with his lov'd Muse to starve. D?set writes Satyr too, but writes so well, O great Apollo! let him still rebell, Pardon a Muse which does so far excell: Pardon a Muse which does with Art support, Some drowsie wit in our unthinking Court. But M?ve strike with many angry Dart, He who profanes thy Name offends thy Art Ne'er saw thy Light yet would usurp thy Power, And govern Wit, and be its Emperour. In fee with Dryden to be counted wise, Who tells the World he has both Wit and Eyes. Rochester's easie Muse does still improve, Each hour thy little wealthy World of Love, (That World in which each Muse is thought a Queen) That he must be forgiven in charity then; Though his sharp Satyrs have offended thee; In charity to Love who will decay, When his delightfull Muse (its only stay) Is by thy Power severely ta'ne away. Forbear (then) Civil Wars, and strike not down Love, who alone supports thy tottering Crown. But sawcy Sh?ard with th'affected train, Who Satyrs write, yet scarce can spell their Name, Blast great Apollo with perpetual shame. The Duel of the Crabs By the Lord B?st. In Milford Lane near to St. Clement's Steeple, There liv'd a Nymph kind to all Christian People: A Nymph she was, whose comely Mien and Stature, Whose height of Eloquence and every Feature, Struck through the heart of City and of Whitehall, And when they pleas'd to court her did 'em right all. Under her beauteous Bosom there did lye A Belly smooth as Ivory. Yet Nature to declare her various Art, Had plac't a Tuft in one convenient part, No Park with smoothest Lawn or highest Wood, Cou'd e're compare with this admir'd abode. Here all the Youth of England did repáre, To take their pleasure and unease their Care. Here the distressed Lover that had born His haughty Mistress Anger or her Scorn Came for Relief; and in this pleasant Shade, Forgot the former, and this Nymph obey'd. And yet what corner of the World is found, Where pain our pleasure does not still surround? One wou'd have thought that in this shady Grove, Nought cou'd have dwelt but quiet, peace and love. But Heaven directed otherwise; for here, I'th' midst of plenty bloody Wars appear: The Gods will frown wherever they do smile; The Crocodile infests the fertil Soil: Lyons and Tygers on the Lybian Plains, Forbid all Pleasures to the fearfull Swains: Wild Beasts in Forests do the Hunters fright, They fear their ruine 'midst of their delight. Thus in the shade of this dark silent Bower, Strength strives with Strenth, &amp; Power vies with Power, Two mighty Monsters did this Wood infest, And struck such awe and terror in the rest, That no Sicilian Tyrant e're cou'd boast He e'er with greater rigour rul'd the roast. Each had his Empire, which he kept in awe, Was by his will obey'd, allow'd no Law: Nature so well divided had their states, Nought but Ambition cou'd have chang'd their fates: For 'twixt their Empire stood a briny Lake, Deep as the Poets do the Centre make; But dire Ambition does admit no bounds, There are no limits to aspiring Crowns. The Spaniard by his Europe Conquests bold, Sail'd o're the Ocean for the Indian's Gold: The Carthaginian Hero did not stay, Because he met vast Mountains in his way: He past the Alps like Molehills; such a Mind As thinks on Conquest will be unconfin'd. Both with these haughty thoughts one course to tend, To try if this vast Lake had any end: Where finding Countries yet without a Name, They might by Conquests get Eternal Fame. After long marches both their Armies tired, At length they find the place so much desired; Where in a little time each does descry, The glymps of an approaching Enemy. They in this sight do equal pleasure prove, As we should do in well rewarded Love: Blood-thirsty Souls, whose only perfect Joy, Consists in what their Fury can destroy. And now both Armies do prepare for fight, And each of th'other unto War incite; In vain, alas, for all their force and strength, Was quite consumed by their Marches length; But the great Chief's impatient of delay, Resolve by single Fight to try the day. Each does the other with Contempt defie, Resolv'd to conquer, or resolv'd to die; Both Armies are commanded to withdraw, In expectation who should give 'em Law; While the amaz'd Spectators full of care, Hope for a better or worse Tyrant fear: And now these Princes meet, now they engage With all their chiefest Strength and highest Rage Now with their Instruments of Wrath they push, As Hills in Earthquakes on each other rush; Where their Militia lies is still in doubt, Whether like Elephants upon their Snout; Or if upon their Heads vast Horns they wore, Or if they fought with Tusks like the wild Boar. Some Greshamites perhaps, with help of Glass, And poring long upon't, may chance to guess; But no tradition has inform'd our age, What were their chiefest instruments of rage? With small or no advantage they proceed, Both are much bruised, and their Wounds do bleed: Both keep their Anger, both do lose their Force, Both get the better, neither get the Worse; Justice her self might put into each Scale One of these Princes, and see neither fall: Spurr'd on by Fury, now they both provide, To let one Graple this great cause decide; Joyning, they strive, and such resistance make, Both fall together in the Briny Lake, Where from the trouble of a tottering Crown, Each mighty Monarch is laid gently down: Both Armies at this sight amazed stand, In doubt, who shall obey, who shall command: In this extremity they both agree, A Commonwealth their Government shall be. Instructions to his Mistress how to behave her self at Supper with her Husband, 1682. Since to restrain our Joys, that ill but rude Familiar thing, your Husband, will intrude; For a just Judgment may th'unwelcome Ghest, At this Night's lucky Supper eat his last: O how shall I with Patience e'er stand by, While my Corinna gives another Joy; His wanton hands in her soft Bosom warms, And folds about her Neck his clasping Arms O tortering Sight, but since it must be so, Be kind, and learn what 'tis I'de have you do. Come first be sure, for tho' the place may prove, Unfit for all we wish, you'll show me Love: When call'd to Table, you demurely go, Gently in passing, touch my hand or so: Mark all my Actions, well observe my Eye, My Speaking, Signs, and to each Sign reply. If I do ought of which you would complain, Upon your Elbow languishingly lean: But if you're pleas'd with what I do or say, Steal me a smile and snatch your Eyes away: When you reflect on our past secret Joys, Hold modestly your Fan before your Eyes; And when the nauseous Husband tedious grows, Your lifted hands with scornfull Anger close, As if you call'd for Vengeance from above, Upon that dull impediment to Love: A thousand skilfull ways we'll find to show, Our mutual Love which none but we shall know. I'll watch the parting Glass where-e'er you drink, And where your Lips have touch'd it, kiss the Brink: Like still the dish that in your reach does stand, Taking the Plate, I so may feel your hand. But what he recommends to you to eat, Coyly refuse, as if you loath'd the Meat; Nor let his Matrimonial Right appear, By any ill-tim'd Houshold freedom there: Let not his fulsom Arms embrace your wast, Nor lolling Head upon your Bosom rest. One Kiss wou'd straight make all my Passion known, And my fierce Eyes with rage would claim their own; Yet what thus passes will be done i'th' Light, But oh! the Joys that may be kept from Sight; Legs lock't in Legs, Thighs pressing Thighs, and all The wanton Spells that up Love's Fury call: Those cunning Arts that I so oft have us'd, Makes me now fear to be my self abus'd; To clear my doubts, so far your Chair remove, As may prevent th'intelligence of Love. Put him in mind of pledging ev'ry Health, And let the tutor'd Page add Wine by stealth: The Sot grown drunk, we easier may retire, And do as the occasion will require: But after all, (alas) how small the gains Will be, for which we take such mighty pains: Torn from my Arms, you must go home to bed, And leave your poor forsaken Lover dead: Cruel Divorce, enough to break my Heart, Without you promise this before we part; When my blest Rival goes to reap his Joy, Receive him so as may the Bliss destroy: Let not the least kind mark of Love escape, But all be Duty and a lawfull Rape; So deadly cold and void of all desire, That like a Charm it may put out the Fire; But if compell'd you should at last comply, When we meet next be sure you all deny. The Session of the Poets, to the Tune of Cook Lawrel. 1 Apollo concern'd to see the Transgressions, Our paultry Poets do daily commit, Gave order once more to summon a Sessions, Severely to punish the abuses of Wit. 2 Will D' Avenant wou'd fain have been Steward o'th' Court, To have fin'd and amerc'd each Man at his Will, But Apollo, it seems, had heard a report, That his choice of new Plays did show h'had no skill. 3 Besides some Criticks had ow'd him a spight, And a little before had made the God fret, By letting him know the Laureat did write, That damnable Farce, The House to be Lett. 4 Intelligence was brought, the Court being set, That a Play Tripartite was very near made, Where malicious Matt Clifford and spiritual S?t, Were joyn'd with their Duke a Peer of the Trade. 5 Apollo rejoyc'd, and did hope for amends, Because he knew it was the first case, The Duke e'er did ask the advice of his Friends, And so wish his Play as well clapt as his Grace. 6 O Yes being made, and silence proclaim'd, Apollo began to read the Court Roul, When as soon as he saw Frank Berkley was nam'd, He scarce cou'd forbear from tearing the Scroul. 7 But Berkley, to make his Interest the greater, Suspecting before what would come to pass, Procur'd him his Cozen Fitzharding's Letter, With which Apollo wiped his Arse. 8 Guy with his Pastoral next went to Pot, At first in a dolefull Study he stood, Then shew'd a Certificate which he had got From the Maids of Honour, but it did him no good. 9 Humorous Weeden came in in a Pet, And for the Laurel began to splutter; But Apollo chid him, and bid him first get A Muse not so common as Mrs. Rutter. 10 A number of other small Poets appear'd, With whom for a time Apollo made sport; Clifford and Flecknoe were very well jear'd, And in conclusion whipp'd out of the Court. 11 Tom Killegrew boldly came up to the Bar, Thinking his jibing would get him the Bays, But Apollo was angry and bid him beware That he caught him no more a printing his Plays. 12 With ill luck in Battle but worse in Wit, George Porter began for the Laurel to bawl, But Apollo did think such Impudence fit To be thrust out of Court, as he's out of Whitehall. 13 Savage missing Cowley came into the Court, Making Apologies for his bad Play, Ev'ry one gave him so bad a Report, That Apollo gave heed to all he could say: 14 Nor wou'd he have had, 'tis thought, a rebuke, Unless he had done some notable Folly; Writ Verses unjustly in praise of Sam Tuke, Or printed his pitifull Melancholy. 15 Cotton did next to the Bays pretend, But Apollo told him it was not fit, Though his Virgil was well, it made but amends For the worst Panegyrick that ever was writ. 16 Old Shirley stood up and made an excuse, Because many young Men before him were got; He vow'd he had switch'd and spur-gall'd his Muse, But still the dull Jade kept to her old Trot. 17 Sir R?t H?d, call'd for over and over, At length sent in Teague with a Pacquet of News, Wherein the sad Knight, to his grief, did discover, How Dryden had lately robb'd him of his Muse. 18 Each Man in the Court was pleas'd with the Theft, Which made the whole Family swear and rant, Desiring their Obin i'th'lurch being left, The Thief might be fin'd for the Wild Gallant. 19 Dryden, whom one wou'd have thought had more Wit, The censure of ev'ry Man did disdain, Pleading some pitifull Rhimes he had writ, In praise of the Countess of Castlemaine. 20 Ned Howard, in whom great Nature is found, Tho' never took notice of till that day, Impatiently sat till it came to his round, Then rose and commended the Plot of his Play. 21 Such Arrogance made Apollo stark mad, But Sherley endeavour'd to appease his Choller, By owning the Play, and swearing the Lad In Poetry was a very pert Schollar. 22 James Howard being call'd for out of the Throng, Booted and spurr'd to the Bar did advance, Where singing a damn'd nonsensical Song, The Youth and his Muse were sent into France. 23 Newcastle and's Horse for entrance next strives, Well stuff'd was his Cloakbag and so was his Breeches, And unbutt'ning the place where Nature's Posset-maker lives, Pull'd out his Wife's Poems, Plays, Essays &amp; Speeches. 24 Whoop, quoth Apollo, what a Devil have we here, Put up thy Wife's Trumpery good noble Marquiss, And home again, home again take thy Carreer, To provide her fresh Straw, and a Chamber that dark is. 25 Sam Tuke sat and formally smil'd at the rest, But Apollo, who well did his Vanity know, Call'd him to the Bar to put him to th'Test, But his Muse was so stiff she scarcely cou'd go. 26 She pleaded her Age desir'd a Reward; It seems in her Age she doated on praise, But Apollo resolv'd that such a bold Bard Shou'd never be grac'd with a Per'wig of Bays. 27 Stapleton stood up and had nothing to say, But Apollo forbid the old Knight to despair, Commanding him once more to write a new Play, To be danc'd by the Poppets at Barth'lomew Fair. 28 Sir William Killegrew doubting his Plays, Before he was call'd crept up to the Bench, And whisper'd Apollo, in case he wou'd praise Selyndra, he should have about with the Wench. 29 B?st and Sydley, with two or three more Translators of Pompey dispute in their claim, But Apollo made them be turn'd out of door, And bid them be gone like Fools as they came. 30 Old Waller heard this, and was sneaking away, But somebody spy'd him out of the Crowd; Apollo tho' h'had not seen him many a day, Knew him full well, and call'd to him aloud; 31 My old Friend, Mr. Waller, what make you there, Among those young Fellows that spoil the French Plays, Then beck'ning to him, whisper'd in his Ear, And gave him good Council instead of the Bays. 32 Then in came Denham, that limping old Bard, Whose Fame on the Sophy and Cooper's Hill stands; And brought many Stationers who swore very hard, That nothing sold better, except 'twere his Lands. 33 But Apollo advis'd him to write something more, To clear a suspicion which possess'd the Court, That Cooper's Hill, so much bragg'd on before, Was writ by a Vicar, who had forty Pound for't. 34 Then Hudibras boldly demanding the Bays, But Apollo bad him not be so fierce, And advis'd him to lay aside making his Plays, Since he already began to write worse and worse. 35 Tom Porter came into the Court in a huff, Swearing damn him, he had writ the best Plays; But Apollo, it seems, knew his way well enough, And wou'd not be hector'd out of his Bays. 36 Ellis in great discontent went away, Whilst D' Avenant against Apollo did rage, Because he declar'd the Secrets a Play, Fitting for none but a Mountebank Stage. 37 John Wilson stood up and wildly did stare, When on the sudden stept in a bold Scot, And offer'd Apollo he freely wou'd swear, The said Maister Wilson mought pass for a Sot. 38 But all was in vain, for Apollo, 'tis said, Would in no wise allow of any Scotch Wit; Then Wilson in spite made his Plays to be read, Swearing he'd answer for all he had writ. 39 Clarges stood up and laid claim to the Bayes, But Apollo rebuk'd that arrogant Fool; Swearing if e're he translated more Plays, He'd Crown him Sir Reverence with a Close-stool. 40 Damn'd Holden with's dull German Princess appear'd, Whom if Davenant he got as some do suppose; Apollo said the Pillory should crop off his Ears, And make them more suitable unto his Nose. 41 Rhodes stood and play'd at Bo-peep in the Door, But Apollo instead of a Spanish Plot; On condition the Varlet would never write more, Gave him three pence to pay for a Pipe and a Pot. 42 Ethridge and Shadwell and the Rabble appeal'd To Apollo himself in a very great rage; Because their best Friends so freely had deal'd, As to tell them their Plays were not fit for the Stage. 43 Then seeing a Crowd in a Tumult resort, Well furnish'd with Verses but loaded with Plays: It forc'd poor Apollo to adjourn the new Court, And left them together by th'Ears for the Bayes. DESIRE. A Pindaric. What art thou, Oh thou new found pain? From what Infection dost thou spring? Tell me, O tell me, thou Inchanting thing, Thy Nature and thy Name. Inform me by what subtil Art, What pow'rfull Influence, You got such vast Dominion in a part Of my unheeded and unguarded Heart, That Fame and Honour cannot drive you thence? Oh mischievous Usurper of my Peace! Oh soft Intruder on my Solitude! Charming disturber of my Ease, That hast my nobler Fate pursu'd; And all the Glories of my Life subdu'd. Thou haun'st my inconvenient hours, The business of the Day, nor silence of the Night, That shou'd to Cares and Sleep invite, Can bid defiance to thy conquering Pow'rs. Where hast thou been this live long Age, That from my birth till now, Thou never didst one Thought ingage, Or charm my Soul with the uneasie rage, That made it all its humbler Feebles know? Where wer't thou, O malicious Sprite, When shining Glory did invite? When Int'rest call'd then thou wer't shy, Nor one kind Aid to my Assistance brought; Nor would'st inspire one tender Thought, When Princes at my Feet did lye. When thou could'st mix Ambition with my Joy, Then, peevish Phantome, thou wer't nice and coy. Not Beauty would invade thee then, Nor all the Arts of lavish Men; Not all the powerfull Rhet'rick of the Tongue, Nor sacred Wit cou'd charm thee on; Not the soft Play that Lovers make, Nor Sighs could fan thee to a Fire; No pleading Tears or Vows cou'd thee awake, Nor charm the unform'd—Something—to Desire. Oft I've conjur'd thee to appear, By Youth, by Love, by all their Pow'rs, Have search'd and sought thee every where, In silent Groves, in lonely Bowers, On flow'ry Beds, where Lovers wishing lye, In sheltring Woods, where sighing Maids To their assigning Shepherds hye, And hide their Blushes in the gloom of Shades. Yet there, ev'n there though Youth assail'd, Where Beauty prostrate lay, and Fortune woo'd, My Heart (insensible) to neither bow'd; Thy lucky Aid was wanting to prevail. In Courts I sought thee then, thy proper Sphere, But thou in Crowds wer't stifled there; Interest did all the loving Bus'ness do, Invites the Youths, and wins the Virgins too; Or if by chance some Heart thy Empire own, Ah, Pow'r ingrate! the Slave must be undone. Tell me thou nimble Fire, that dost dilate Thy mighty force through every part What God or Human Power did thee create In my (till now) unfacil Heart? Art thou some welcome Plague sent from above, In this dear Form, this kind Disguise? Or the false Offspring of mistaken Love, Begot by some soft Thought, that feebly strove With the bright-piercing Beauties of Lysander's Eyes. Yes, yes, Tormenter, I have found thee now, And found to whom thou dost thy Being owe; 'Tis thou the Blushes do'st impart, 'Tis thou that tremblest in my Heart. When the dear Shepherd does appear, I faint and dye with pleasing pain; My Words intruding Sighings break, Whene're I touch the charming Swain; Whene're I gaze, whene're I speak, Thy conscious Fire is mingled with my Love. As in the sanctify'd Abodes Misguided Worshippers approve The mixing Idols with their Gods. In vain (alas) in vain I strive, With Errours, which my Soul do please and vex; For Superstition will survive, Purer Religion to perplex. Oh tell me, you Philosophers in Love, That can these burning Fev'rish Fits controul, By what strange Arts you cure the Soul, And the fiery Calenture remove? Tell me, ye Fair ones, you that give Desire, How 'tis you hide the kindling Fire. Oh wou'd you but confess the Truth, It is not real Vertue makes you nice: But when you do resist the pressing Youth, 'Tis want of dear Desire to thaw the Virgin-Ice. And while your young Adorers lye, All languishing and hopeless at your Feet; Raising new Trophies to your Chastity, Oh, tell me how you do remain discreet? And not the Passion to the Throng make known, Which Cupid in revenge has now confin'd to one. How you suppress the rising Sighs, And the soft-yielding Soul that wishes in your Eyes, While to the admiring Crowd you nice are found, Some dear, some secret Youth, who gives the wound, Informs you all your Vertue's but a Cheat, And Honour but a false Disguise, Your Modesty a necessary slight, To gain the dull repute of being Wise. Deceive the foolish World, deceive it on, And veil your Passion in your Pride; But now I've found your weakness by my own, From me the needfull fraud you cannot hide; For, though with Vertue I the World perplex, Lysander finds the feeble of my Sex: So Helen, tho' from Theseus's Arms she fled, To Charming Paris yields her Heart and Bed. On the Prince's going to England, with an Army to Restore the Government, 1688. Hunc saltem everso Juvenem succurrere Sæclo Ne prohibite — Virg. Georg. Lib. 1. Once more a FATHER and a SON falls out, The World involving in their high Dispute; Remotest India's Fate on theirs depends, And Europe, trembling, the Event attends. Their Motions ruling every other State, As on the Sun the lesser Planets wait. Power warms the Father, Liberty the Son, A Prize well worth th'uncommon Venture run. Him a false Pride to Govern unrestrain'd, And by bad Means, bad Ends to be attain'd; All Bars of Property drives headlong through, Millions oppressing to inrich a few. Him Justice urges, and a noble Aim To equal his Progenitors in Fame, And make his Life as glorious as his Name. For Law and Reason's power he does engage, Against the Reign of Appetite and Rage. There all the licence of unbounded Might; Here conscious Honour, and deep sense of Right, Immortal enmity to Arms incite. Greatness the one, Glory the other fires, This only can deserve what that desires. This strives for all that e're to Men was dear, And he for what they most abhorr and fear. Cæsar and Pompey's Cause by Cato thought So ill adjudg'd, to a new Tryal's brought, Again at last Pharsalia must be fought. Ye fatal Sisters! now to Right be Friends, And make Mankind for Pompey's Fate amends. In Orange's Great Line, 'tis no new thing, To free a Nation, and Uncrown a King. On his Royall Highness's Voyage beyond Sea. March 3d. 1678. R. H. they say is gone to Sea, Designed for the Hague; But Portsmouth's left behind to be The Nations Whorish plague. Some think he went unwillingly, Say others he was sent there; But most conclude for certainty, He's gone to keep his Lent there. What need I to apologize? 'Tis said nothing more true is, The chiefest part of's Errand lies, To fetch in Cosen Lewis. That both together, as they say, If one may dare to speak on't; Thro' Hereticks Throats may cut their way, To bring in James the Second. By Yea and Nay the Quaker cries, How can we hope for better? Truth's not in him that this denies; Read Edward Coleman's Letter. Gar, gar, the Jockey swears faw things, Man here is mickle work; Dee'l split his Wem, he's ne'er be King, Whose Name does rhime to Pork. Got's splutter a Nails the Welshman cries, Got shield her frow her Foes; He ne'er shall be a Prince of Wales, That wears a Roman Nose. The RABBLE. 1680. The Rabble hates, the Gentry fear, And Wise men want support: A rising Country threatens, There, And Here, a starving Court. Not for the Nation, but the Fair, Our Treasury provides: Bu?ly's Go?'s only care, As M?ton is H?de's. R?ly too late will understand, What now he shuns to find; That nothing's quiet in the Land, Except his careless Mind. England is now 'twixt Thee and Y?k, The Fable of the Frog: He is the fierce devouring Stork, And Thou the lumpish Log. A New Song of the Times. 1683. 1 'Twere folly for ever The Whigs to Endeavour Disowning their Plots, when all the world knows 'um; Did they not fix On a Council of Six, Appointed to Govern though no body chose 'um? They that bore sway, Knew not one would Obey, Did Trincalo make such a ridiculous pother: Monmouth's the Head, To strike Monarchy dead, They chose themselves Vice-Roys all o're one another. 2 Was't not a damn'd thing For Russel and Hambden, To serve all the Projects of hot-headed Tony? But much more untoward, To appoint my Lord Howard Of his own Purse and Credit to raise Men and Money? That at Kneghtsbridge did hide Those brisk Boys unspy'd, Who at Shaftsbury's whistle were ready to follow; And when Aid he should bring, Like a true Brandford King, Was here with a whoop &amp; gone with a hollow. 3 Algernoon Sidney, Of Commonwealth Kidney, Compos'd a damn'd Libel (ay marry was it) Writ to occasion Ill-Blood in the Nation, And therefore dispers'd it all over his Closet. It was not the Writing Was prov'd, or Indicting; Tho' he urg'd Statutes, what was it but fooling, Since a new Trust is Plac'd in the Chief Justice, To damn Law and Reason too by Over-ruling. 4 What if a Traytor, In spite of the State Sir, Should cut his own Throat from one Ear to the other? Shall then a new freak Make Braddon and Speak To be more concern'd than his Wife or his Brother? A Razor all bloody, Thrown out of a Study, Is Evidence strong of his desperate Guilt, Sir; So Godfrey, when dead, Full of horrour and dread, Run his Sword thro' his Body up to the Hilt Sir. 5 Who can think the case hard Of Sir Patience Ward, That lov'd his just Rights more than those of his Highness? Oh Disloyal Ears, As on Record appears, Not to hear when to doe the Papists a kindness. An old doting Citt, With his Elizabeth Wit, Against the French mode for freedom to hope on. His Ears that told lies, Were less dull than his Eyes, For both them were shut when all others were open. 6 All Europe together Can't shew such a Father, So tenderly nice of his Son's Reputation, As our good King is, To labour to bring his, By tricks to subscribe to a sham Declaration. 'Twas very good reason To pardon his Treason, To obey (not his own, but) his Brother's Command, Sir; To merit whose grace, He must in the first place Confess he's dishonest under his hand, Sir. 7 Since Fate the Court blesses, With daily Successes, And giving up Charters go round for a frolick, Whilst our D? Nero, The Churches blind Hero By Murder is planting his Faith Apostolick. Our Modern Sages, More wise than past Ages, Think ours to Establish by Popish Successors; Queen Bess never thought it, And Cecil forgot it, But 'tis lately found out by our prudent Addressors. The Battle-Royall: A Dream. 1687. As restless on my Bed one Night I lay, Hoping with Sleep to ease the toyls of Day, I thought, as graver Coxcombs us'd to doe, On all the mischiefs we had late ran through, And those which are now likely to ensue: What 'tis that thus the frantick Nation dreads? And from what Cause their Jealousie proceeds? Whither at last, to what Event, and End, These sad Presages probably might tend? For as Physicians always chuse to know Th'original Cause from whence Distempers flow, And by their early Symptoms boldly guess, Whether or no their Art shall have success; So I, like a young bold State Emp'rick too, Did the same methods, and same course pursue; Till with variety of Thoughts opprest, I turn'd about to sleep, and take my rest: While Fancy like a Queen alone bore sway, And did this Vision in a Dream convey. Unknown, and unperceiv'd, I was me thought, Into a close retiring Chamber brought; And by my Guide behind the Hangings plac'd, Where I cou'd hear and see whatever pass'd: When in a corner of the Room there sate Three fierce contenders in a hot Debate; And on a Table lay before them there The Directory, Masse, and Common-Pray'r. This in a Cloak, That had a shaven Crown, The other in a Surcingle and Gown; Who by his Garb, Demeanour, and grave Look, I for a Church of England Preacher took; For howsoe'er they're drest they may be known By a peculiar Carriage of their own. At first I heard a strange confused sound, Nor could the meaning, nor the sense expound; Till he I mention'd last in rage up rose, And partly through the mouth, and thro' the nose, Did thus his whining Sentiments disclose. And is this all the great Reward we must Enjoy for being faithfull to our Trust? Will all the Services we've done the King No better recompence and profit bring? And can our boasted Loyalty return No other Payment but Contempt and Scorn? Must we thus basely from our Hopes fall down, And grow the publick scandal of the Town? As our insulting Pride and Government Has been the publick Grievance and Complaint, Our Prebends, and our Bishops too, turn'd out, Depriv'd, and scorn'd, in Querpo walk about; And must a Transubstantiating Priest Be with their goodly Lands and Lordships blest? Did we for this the Popish Plot deride, And all our Sense, and Nonsense too, apply'd To blind the peoples Reason and their Eyes, To take it for a Sham and meer Device: Our best and learned'st of Divines employ To foile the Scent, and to divert the Cry; Set bawling P?ing up to talk it down, And fill with canting Raillery the Town? Did we for this, young Levites send about, To charm the Rabble, and possess the Rout, With feign'd Chymera's of a strange Design, Against the Church, and State, and Royal Line? And vilely Russel and the rest remov'd, When neither Crime or Plot was ever prov'd? Nay did we all for this the Church disown, And coin a New Religion of our own, Of a more spruce and fashionable make, Than was the Old, and boldly undertake By Scripture for to prove the Common Prayer, When we well knew there's no such matter there: Yet like the Calves at Bethel set it up, And made them all before the Idol stoop; And whosoe're the business would dispute, We did by Fines and Pillory confute. O precious Book! the dearest thing that's ours, Except our Livings and our Sine-cures; For which, might they but still with us abide, Wee'd part with thee, or any thing beside: As heretofore without reluctance we, Have truck'd our forfeit Consciences for thee: But those are going too—no more he cou'd, Prevented by an overflowing Flood Of Tears, which his lawn Band and Gown besmear'd, As th'Ointment drench'd his Predecessor's Beard. The subtle Priest who had resolv'd to stay, Till he had spoken all he had to say; Seeing the Wretch with too much Grief o'relaid, Stood up, and thus the following Answer made. 'Tis true, you've done all this and ten times more, As bad or worse than we have done before; And if ye think ye have oblig'd the King, Who were but under-Actors in the thing; Then what do we deserve, whose Wit and Brain Contriv'd the Plot and every private Scene? For though a Conquest alwaies is obtain'd, And by each Souldier's single valour gain'd; Yet those who did Command and lead them on, Share all the open Honour and Renown. Ye were our Instruments, and Drudges too; As Rumney, Keeling, Howard, were to you; Who when they brought about your own design, You left them to themselves to starve and pine: So we the grand projectors of the Plot, Who did to you your several Parts allot, Having no farther Service to employ, Think fit, as useless Tools, to lay you by. Besides, what Title or, Pretence have you, To any thing ye hold as right and due, Since they were settled first on us alone, And could no other Lords and Masters own; Till ye by Rapine, Sacrilege and Force, Discas'd us of our Rights and made them yours? Nor can a Case more Legal e're appear, At Court of Conscience, or at Chanc'ry Barr, Than what ye did by violence obtain, Should to their ancient Lords return again. But that which you so much insist upon, Your boasted Loyalty, and Service done, From whence ye most erroneously inferr'd, The justice of your Claim to a Reward, Is a meer trifle and a weak defence, With no validity of Consequence; For there's no reason he should be repaid, Who undesignedly a Kindness did; When all the while his Thoughts were fix'd upon His own Advancement and Increase alone; And all the Profit that to me he brings, Is by the bye and natural course of things: 'Twas rancour, envy, meer revenge and spight, That made ye thus against Fanaticks fight; And the dear dread of losing all ye had, That first engag'd your malice on our side, To plead the Royall Cause, and to promote The King's Concern, and for Succession vote; When could ye any other way have kept The Saddle, and in ease and safety slept, The King might have been banish'd, hang'd or drown'd E're Succour or Relief from you have found. But matters and affairs as yet are not To such a difficult Conjuncture brought, But that an handsome Fetch may bring ye off With Honour and Security enough: One gentle Turn will all the business doe, Advance your Livings and secure them too; Safe ye shall lie from all Phanatick harms, Encircled in your Mother-Churches Arms, From which ye've stray'd so long, and now to whom, Ye ought in duty and respect to come. The mournfull Levite straight prickt up his Ears, As glad that things were better than his Fears, And joyfull heard what means the Priest had found, That might for his dear Benefice compound, Compos'd his Band, and wip'd his blubber'd Cheeks, Stood up again and thus demurely speaks: The Proverb to my case I may apply, Winners may justly laugh and Losers cry. For when I thought my Livelihood was gone, It was no wonder that I so took on; As 'tis none now, Smiles should my gladness show, For these good Tydings I receive from you; Therefore, dear Sir, let us our Hearts combine, And both in league against Dissenters joyn. My self I under your Tuition place, For Management and Method in the case, How to proceed—The Cloak who all this while Had unprovok'd and unconcern'd sate still, And wisely what they'd both be at had guest, Stood up to speak and to compleat the Jest: But glowing Anger had so now prevail'd, That in the first attempt he stopp'd and fail'd; And when he found his Tongue to be confin'd, He made his active Hands declare his Mind. The one engag'd the Levite on the place, And with the Directory smote his Face. Confounded with the Stroke he stagger'd round, And falling in his wrath tore up the Ground. T'other he laid directly o're the Chest, Sent Echoes from the hollow Breast of Priest, Who stumbling as he went to take his flight, Fell prostrate o're his new made Proselyte. On both their Bodies mounts the nimble Cloke, And this his Epicinium manly spoke: Dejected Wretches, there together lye, Unpitied, unbewail'd by every Eye; May after-Ages your curst Names deride, As we your damn'd Hypocrisies and Pride; No Mark remain to know what ye have been, But the remembrance of your Curse and Sin; Which shall down Time's continual tide descend, To propagate your fatal shame and end. So may they fall, and all they that design, Who e'er in league against the Truth combine, By an unarm'd defenceless hand like mine. Pleas'd with the Conquest of Victorious Cloke, I laugh'd aloud methought, and so awoke. An Epitaph upon Felton, who was hanged in Chains for Murdering the Old Duke of Buckingham written by the late Duke of Buckingham. Here uninterr'd suspends, though not to save Surviving Friends th'Expences of a Grave, Felton's dead Earth; which to the World will be Its own sad Monument, his Elegie: As large as Fame, which whether Bad or Good I say not; by himself 'twas wrote in Blood; For which his Body is intomb'd in Air, Arch'd o're with Heaven, set with a thousand fair And glorious Stars; a Noble Sepulcher, Which Time it self can't ruinate; and where Th'impartial Worm (that is not brib'd to spare Princes corrupt in Marble) cannot share His Flesh; which oft the charitable Skies Imbalm with Tears; daining those Obsequies Belong to Men shall last, till pitying Fowl Contend to reach his Body to his Soul. An Answer to Mr. Waller's Poem on Oliver's Death; called the Storm written by Sir W???????? G?. 'Tis well he's gone (O had he never been) Hurried in Storms, loud as his crying Sin; The Pines and Oakes fell prostrate at his Urn; That with his Soul his Body too might burn: Winds pluck up Roots, and fixed Cedars move, Roaring for Vengeance to the Heavens above. From Theft, like his, great Romulus did grow, And such a Wind did at his Ruine blow. Strange that the lofty Trees themselves should fell Without the Axe; so Orpheus went to Hell: At whose descent the stoutest Rocks were cleft, And the whole Wood its wonted station left. In Battle Hercules wore the Lyon's Skin; But our fierce Nero wore the Beast within: Whose Heart was brutish more than Face or Eyes, And in the shape of Man was in Disguise: Where ever Men, where ever Pillage lies, Like Ravenous Vultures our wing'd Navy flies: Under the Tropick we are understood, And bring home Rapine through a purple Flood: New Circulations found our Blood is hurl'd, As round the lesser to the greater World. In Civil Broils he did us first engage, And made Three Kingdoms subject to his Rage. One Fatal Stroke slew Justice and the Cause Of Truth, Religion, and our Sacred Laws. So fell Achilles by the Trojan Band, Though he still fought with Heaven its self in's hand: Nor would Domestick Spoil confine his Mind, Nor Limits to his Fury but Mankind. The British Youths in Foreign Courts are sent, Towns to destroy, but more to Banishment; Who since they cannot in this Isle abide, Are confin'd Prisoners to the World beside. No wonder then if we no Tears allow To him that gave us Wars and Ruine too: Tyrants that lov'd him, griev'd concern'd to see, There must be Punishment for Cruelty. Nature her self rejoyced at his Death, And on the Waters sung with such a Breath, As made the Sea dance higher than before, While her glad Waves came dancing to the Shore. FINIS. The Second Part. Written during the Reign of K. James the II. against Popery and Slavery, and his Arbitrary Proceedings. Miscellany POEMS, &amp;c. The Man of HONOUR. Occasioned by a Postscript of Pen's Letter. Not all the Threats or Favours of a Crown, A Princes Whisper, or a Tyrants Frown, Can awe the Spirit, or allure the Mind Of him, who to strict Honour is enclin'd; Though all the Pomp and Pleasure that does wait On publick Places, and Affairs of State, Shou'd fondly court him to be base and great. With even Passions, and with settled Face, He wou'd remove the Harlots false Embrace: Tho' all the Storms and Tempests should arise, That Church-Magicians in their Cells devise, And from their settled Basis Nations tear, He wou'd unmov'd the mighty Ruin bear; Secure in Innocence contemn 'em all, And decently array'd in Honours, fall. For this brave Shrewsbury and Lumly's Name, Shall stand the foremost in the List of Fame; Who first with steady Minds the Current broke, And to the suppliant Monarch boldly spoke. Great Sir, renown'd for Constancy, how just Have we obey'd the Crown, and serv'd our Trust, Espous'd your Cause and Interest in distress, Your self must witness, and our Foes confess! Permit us then ill Fortune to accuse, That you at last unhappy Councils use, And ask the only thing we must refuse. Our Lives and Fortunes freely we'll expose, Honour alone we cannot, must not lose: Honour, that Spark of the Cœlestial Fire, That above Nature makes Mankind aspire; Ennobles the rude Passions of our Frame, With thirst of Glory, and desire of Fame; The richest Treasure of a generous Breast, That gives the Stamp and Standard to the rest. Wit, Strength and Courage, are wild dangerous force, Unless this softens and directs their Course; And would you rob us of the noblest part, Accept a Sacrifice without a Heart? 'Tis much beneath the Greatness of a Throne, To take the Casket when the Jewel's gone; Debauch our Principles, corrupt our Race, And teach the Nobles to be False and Base. What Confidence can you in them repose. Who, e're they serve you, all their Value lose; Who once enslave their Conscience to their Lust, Have lost the Reins, and can no more be Just. Of Honour, Men at first, like Women Nice, Raise Maiden-Scruples at unpractis'd Vice; Their modest Nature curbs the strugling Flame, And stifles what they wish to act, with Shame. But once this Fence thrown down, when they perceive That they may taste forbidden Fruit and live; They stop not here their Course, but safely in, Grow Strong, Luxuriant, and bold in Sin; True to no Principles, press forward still, And only bound by appetite their Will: Now fawn and flatter, while this Tide prevails, But shift with every veering blast their Sails. Mark those that meanly truckle to your Power, They once deserted and chang'd sides before, And would to morrow Mahomet adore! On higher Springs true Men of Honour move, Free is their Service, and unbought their Love: When Danger calls, and Honour leads the way, With Joy they follow, and with Pride obey: When the Rebellious Foe came rolling on, And shook with gathering Multitudes the Throne, Where were the Minions then? What Arms, what Force, Cou'd they oppose to stop the Torrents Course? Then Pembrook, then the Nobles firmly stood, Free of their Lives, and lavish of their Blood; But when your Orders to mean Ends decline, With the same Constancy they all resign. Thus spake the Youth, who open'd first the way, And was the Phosphorus to th'dawning day; Follow'd by a more glorious splendid Hoast, Than any Age, or any Realm can boast: So great their Fame, so numerous their Train, To name were endless, and to praise in vain; But Herbert and great Oxford merit more, Bold is their flight, and more sublime they soar; So high, their Virtue as yet wants a name, Excceding wonder, and surpassing Fame: Rise, glorious Church, erect thy radiant Head, The Storm is past, th'Impending Tempest fled: Had Fate decreed thy Ruine or Disgrace, It had not given such Sons, so brave a Race. When for Destruction Heaven a Realm designs, The Symptoms first appear in slavish Minds: These men would prop a sinking Nations weight, Stop falling Vengeance, and Reverse even Fate. Let other Nations boast their fruitful Soil, Their fragrant Spices, their rich Wine and Oil; In breathing Colours, and in living Paint Let them excel, their Mastery we grant. But to instruct the mind, to arm the Soul With Virtue, which no dangers can controul; Exalt the thought, a speedy Courage lend, That Horrour cannot shake, or pleasure bend: These are the English Arts, these we profess To be the same in Mis'ry and Success; To teach Oppressors Law, assist the good, Relieve the Wretched, and subdue the Proud: Such are our Souls: But what doth Worth avail, When Kings commit to hungry Priests the Scale? All Merit's light when they dispose the weight, Who either would embroil, or rule the State. Defame those Heroes who their Yoke refuse, And blast that Honesty they cannot use; The strength and safety of the Crown destroy, And the King's Power against himself imploy: Affront his Friends, deprive him of the brave, Bereft of these he must become their Slave. Men, like our Money, come the most in play For being base, and of a course allay. The richest Medals, and the purest Gold, Of native value, and exactest mold, By worth conceal'd, in private Closets shine, For vulgar use too precious and too fine, Whilst Tin and Copper with new stamping bright, Coin of base Metal, counterfeit and light, Do all the Business of the Nations turn, Rais'd in Contempt, us'd and employ'd in Scorn: So shining Vertues are for Courts too bright, Whose guilty Actions fly their searching light; Rich in themselves, disdaining to aspire, Great without Pomp they willingly retire: Give place to Fools, whose rash misjudging sence Increases the weak measures of their Prince; Prone to admire, and flatter him in ease, They study not his good, but how to please; They blindly and implicitly run on, Nor see those dangers which the others shun: Who slow to act, each business duly weigh, Advise with Freedom, and with Care obey; With Wisdom fatal to their Interest strive To make their Monarch lov'd, and Nation thrive; Such have no place where Priests and Women Reign, VVho love fierce Drivers, and a looser Rein. The Man of no Honour. As the late Character of Godlike Men, (Given, as it ought, by a Diviner Pen) Will make the Race of those I write appear Low as to Glorious Valour, wretched Fear; So the smooth Lines in which those Truths are told, (Lines justly happy as they're Nobly bold) VVith right from humble Muses bold Esteem, And show my Verse as distant as my Theam. Forgive me, you Betrayers of your Land, If I do scourge you with a wanting Hand; My Will is good to give you all your due, The Pope will pardon want of Power in you. Your Aid, my Muse, this once I humbly ask, Exposing Villany's a Noble task; Assist my story with such ample Phrase, It may find leave to live and see good Days: Stamp an Eternal Value on the Brave, By drawing to the Life a sneaking Knave; Show him how justly he's expos'd by all, And show him time may come when he may fall; Show him on what Foundation now he stands, Show him, instead of Rocks, mistaken Lands; Show him it lately fail'd believing man, And will do so when time shall serve again. When Oxford Prophesies were come to pass, And many a squeamish Church-man prov'd an Ass, Then blockish Honesty was made give ground, And foolish Knaves were much more useful found; A search throughout the Senate pass'd for such, (Since Fools would do to find no more 'twas much) Vile Interest was oppos'd to Men of sense, And many from that hour did Rogues commence. Besides, with Gold the despicable Slaves, Were willingly thought Fools, they might be Knaves. Of these the Chief a Consultation call, Where they shall stop, or whether stop at all. Some faint Resistance Conscience wou'd have made, And Honour wou'd have spoke, but was forbad; Interest with Impudence assum'd the Chair, And thus address'd to each Plebeian Fool was there: Of all Philosophers that plagu'd the World, And curious Brains in various Labyrinths hurl'd, None far'd so ill, and yet so justly far'd, As those Preach'd Vertue for its own Reward; More useful Doctrines sprung from wiser Schools, They heard their Morals, and resolv'd them Fools. Mark those who strive the multitude to please, Nice of their Honour, lavish of their Ease: How in the gazing crowd they humbly stand, With their perplexing Honesty at hand, They dare not use the strength they may command. They prove their Grandeur from their humble Soul, But he is great who can and dare controul; You'll soar above, exhal'd by Princely Rays, And with contempt look down on rotten Praise; Laugh at dull Notions of a Glorious Name, When Beggery's the Basis of its Frame. More useful Honour shall attend your Fate, You serve a Power can make you Rich and Great, VVho scorns the Nations Love shall live above their Hate. Permit no Bugbear thoughts against your Cause, The loss of your Religion and the Laws, Trifles to those who dare their God defy, And can with copious Consciences comply. Contemn ye foolish Threats of distant Time, 'Tis plain that Honesty is yet a Crime; If things hereafter turn another way, You'll still be right, for still you can obey: Ne'r fear the Brand of Knave will hurt you much, The best of Courts will stand in need of such; Fools oft grow useless, and are laid aside, But Knaves of Conduct always will abide: Old honesty some poor Employ may get, But he that sticks at nothing shall be great, The Villain wisely thrives in every State. Thus Interest spoke, and merits just Applause, The Judges first declar'd against the Laws; Of Levi's Tribe not many went astray, (Much wonder'd at, since they procur'd this Day) But men of Conscience oft in Judgment fail, Mistaken Loyalty did once prevail, But such Diseases now no more they ail. Become good Christians by Afflictons Rod, Their King they Honour, but they fear their God. Of those that brand their Country with Disgrace, Noble in Title as in Practice base, Give underhand Pre-eminence of place, The sniveling Representer of the rest, VVho in their Names the Monarch thus addrest: Most Glorious Prince, in whom all Vertues shine, VVhere every worth in one great Soul combine; You for your Gracious Deeds we come to bless, But most of all your constancy confess; Safe by your VVord, in Peace your people sleep, Your sacred VVord which you so nicely keep; That word so much throughout your Land Renown'd, In which Equivocation ne'r was found. On this it is so firmly we rely, You cannot ask the thing we can deny; As Heaven has taught the Soul of men to know, VVhat e're it pleaseth to dispence below, Shall to advantage of believers tend, And bless their blind Obedience in the end; So we such awful Thoughts of you receive, What e're you'll do we for our good believe; Our grand Ambition is our King to please, We ne'r can want Repose while he's at Ease. When by Obedience we have giv'n you rest, And blasted ev'n the frightful Name of Test, But smile upon us, and your Slaves are blest. Thus spake the fawning Minister of State, Poor in Esteem, and despicably Great; The Monarch blest the Priesthood skill, Forsakes his Reason to perform his Will, Deserts his Noble Friends for flattering Knaves, Neglects his Subjects whilst he favours Slaves. Rise up, brave Prince, attend your Natures Course, We know that's Noble, when exempt from force; Spread your relenting Arms, imbrace your Friends, They'll help you to attain more Noble Ends; You know their Love, the Rebels know their Force, Serve God with speed, annul th'unjust Divorce, Then shall you stand great in your Peoples Love, A lively Emblem of the Mighty Jove. Then shall your haughty Rival cease to soar, And tremble at the Neighb'ring Brittish shore; The Senates Bounty shall preserve you still, VVith cheerful Tribute all your Coffers fill. All Kings shall gaze with Envy on your Throne, Then with Contempt look down upon their own; To gain your smiles shall be their utmost Pride, And happy he who nearest is ally'd. Belov'd by God and Men you shall remain, Great without VVar, and undisturb'd your Reign. Then when the Remnant of your days are done, The Thred of Glorious Life at length is spun, Sincere in Grief your people all shall mourn, Some goodly Fabrick shall your Grave adorn VVith this Inscription, for Eternal Praise, Here lyes the only Prince who left all Evil Ways. The VISION. Twas at an hour when busie Nature lay Dissolv'd in slumbers from the noisy Day, When gloomy shades and dusky Atoms spread A darkness o'er the Universal Bed, And all the gaudy beams of light were fled; My flutt'ring fancy 'midst the silent peace, Careless of sleep, and unconcern'd with ease, Drew to my wandring thoughts an object near, Strange in its form, and in appearance rare. Methought (yet sure it could not be a Dream, So real all its Imperfections seem) With Princely Port a stately Monarch came, Airy his mein, and Noble was his frame: A sullen sorrow brooded on his Brow; He seem'd beneath some weighty Fate to bow; Distrust and Grief upon his Eye-lids rest, And show the strugling troubles of his Breast. Upon his Head a nodding Crown he wore, And in his Hand a yielding Scepter bore; Forlorn and careless did his strokes appear, And every motion spoke a wild Despair. This mournful Scene did all my Passions move, And challeng'd both my pity and my love, And yet I thought him by the ruins made Above my pity, and beyond my aid; Long did he in a pensive silence stand, For sure his thoughts cou'd not his words command: Too big for speech— Till sullen murmurs from his bosom flew, And thus a draught of his disorders drew. Almighty Powers! By whose consent alone Ordain'd, I did ascend the Regal Throne, Led by your dark Decrees, and Conduct there, I, as your great Vicegerent, did appear Beneath my charge, whilst crowding Nations sate, And bow'd and did admire my rising Fate: 'Twas then my Laurels fresh and blooming grew, And a loud Fame of all my Glories flew; My willing Subjects bless and clap the day; The bravest and the best were all my friends, Whilst Faction in confusion sneak'd away; At distance grinn'd, but could not reach their ends. Such Faith unto my promises were shown, My Word they took, for Oaths were useless grown; My very Word compos'd their hopes and fears, Sacred 'twas held, and all Serene appears: Until my Fate revers'd did backwards reel, Blurr'd all my Fame, and alter'd Fortune's Wheel; Ye Gods! Why did ye thus unconstant prove? Was I the Envy of th'Abodes above? Or was this stately Majesty but given To be the Cheat and Flatt'ry ev'n of Heaven? Can ne'er a Saint implore Cœlestial aid? Nor yet the Virgin Goddess intercede? 'Twas for her Cause engag'd I suff'ring lie; 'Twas to advance her just Divinity: Yes, I avow the Quarrel and the Cause, 'Twas for my Faith, and to out-cope the Laws. I'de rather be forsaken and alone, Than sit a craving Monarch on a Throne: Let all my cringing Slaves at distance stand, Fawn on th'Invading Foe, and kiss his Hand; Leave me their Prince, forsaken and forlorn, Expos'd to all their slights and public scorn. Let after Ages judge the mighty Test, Judge the Magnifick Grandure of my breast. I saw my great forefather yet afore Seal all his Sacred Vows with Martyr'd gore; His Royal Issue branded with disgrace, Saw all th'Efforts they us'd t'Exclude the Race: And yet these Terrours all I dare invade, Thus Conscience, thus Religion does perswade. I'll stand or fall by both those Tenets still, And be the second Martyr to my Will: And then he stop'd, his fiery Eye-Balls move, And thus with his resisting Fate he strove, And stood, like Capaneus Defying Jove. When streight a noise, from whence it came unknown, Was heard to answer in an angry tone; Die then, unpity'd Prince, for thus thy Fate Long since, by its Decrees, did antedate: To such perversness, what regard is shown? What Merit could'st thou plead to mount a Throne? To thy repeated Wishes Heav'n was kind, And pleas'd the wild Ambition of thy mind; It put a Scepter in thy eager Hand, Yet not t'oppose the Genius of the Land; If Reason could not sway thy Actions here, Heaven's not oblig'd by Wonders to appear. See how thy Creatures at a distance stand, Sculk from thy troubles to a safer Land; Those who their beings to thy bounty own, Forsake their fawning Cheats, and now are gone. Those who were Friends to thee and to thy Cause, Bold for their Rights, and for their Countries Laws, Thou, from thy darker Counsels, did'st remove, And want their aid, now they refuse their love. Some more imperfect sounds did reach my ear, But sense return'd, and day-light did appear. The ADVICE. Would you be Famous and Renown'd in Story, And after having run a Stage of Glory, Go streight to Heaven and not to Purgatory: This is the time. Would you surrender your Dispensing Power, And send the Western Hangman to the Tower, From whence he'll find it difficult to scoure. This, &amp;c. Would you send Father P?n, and Father L??, Assisted by the Poet Laureat Squab, To teach Obedience Passive to the Mob. This, &amp;c. Would you let Reverend Father Peters know What thanks the Church of England to him owe For Favours past, he did on them bestow. This, &amp;c. Would you with expedition send away Those four dim Lights, made Bishops t'other day, To convert Indians in America. This, &amp;c. Would you the rest of that Bald-Pated Train No longer flatter with thin hopes of Gain, But send them to Saint Omers back again. This, &amp;c. Would you (instead of holding Birchen tool) Send Pulton to be lash'd at Busbey's School, That he in Print no longer play the Fool. This, &amp;c. Would you that Jack of all Religions scare, Bid him for Hanging speedily prepare, That Harry H???s may visit Harry Care. This, &amp;c. Would you let Ireland no more fear Macdonnel, And all the Rabble under Philem O Neale, And Clarendon again succeed Tyrconnel. This, &amp;c. Would you court Ear-wiggs banish from your Ears, Those Carpet-Knights, and interested Peers, And rid the Kingdoms from impending Fears. This, &amp;c. Would you at once make all the Hogan Mogans yield, And be at once their Terrour and our Shield, And not appear by Proxy in the Field. This, &amp;c. Would you no more a Womans Council take, But love your Kingdoms for your Kingdoms sake, Make Subjects Love and Enemies to Quake. This, &amp;c. The CONVERTS. I did intend in Rhimes Heroick To write of Converts Apostolick, Describe their persons and their shames, And leave the World to guess their Names: But soon I thought the scoundrel Theme Was for Heroick Song too mean; Their Characters we'll then rehearse In Burlesque, or in Dogrel Verse; Of Earls, of Lords, of Knights I'll sing, That chang'd their Faith to please their King. The first an Antiquated Lord, A walking Mummy in a word, Moves cloath'd in Plaisters Aromatick, And Flannel, by the help of a Stick, And like a grave and noble Peer, Outlives his Sense by Sixty year; And what an honest Man would anger, Outlives the Fort he built at Tanger; By Pox and Whores long since undone, Yet loves it still, and fumbles on: Why he's a Favourite few can guess, Some say it's for his Ugliness; For often Monsters (being rare) Are valued equal to the Fair: For in his Mistresses, kind James Loves ugliness in its extreams; But others say 'tis plainly seen, 'Tis for the choice he made o'th' Queen; VVhen he the King and Nation blest VVith Off-Spring of the House of Este; A Dame whose Affability Equals her Generosity: Oh! VVell match'd Pair, who frugally are bent To live without the aids of Parliament. All this and more the Peer perform'd, Then to compleat his Virtues, turn'd; But twas not Conscience, or Devotion, The hopes of Riches or Promotion, That made his Lordship first to vary, But 'twas to please his Daughter Mary; And she to make retaliation, Is full as lewd in her Vocation. The next a Caravanish Thief, A lazy Mass of damn'd Rump Beef; Prodigious Guts, no Brains at all, But very Rhynocerical, VVas Married ere the Cub was lickt, And now not worthy to be kickt; By Jockeys bubbled, forc'd to fly, To save his Coat, to Italy, VVhere H?s and he, that virtuous Youth, Equal in Honour, Sense, and Truth; By Reason and pure Conscience urged, Past Sins by Abjuration purged: But 'tis believ'd both Rogue and Peer, More worldly Motives had to veer; The Scoundrel Plebeians swerving Was to secure himself from starving; And that which made the Peer a Starter, VVas hope of a long wish'd for Garter. Next comes a Peer who sits at Helm, And long has steer'd the giddy Realm. VVith Taylors motion, mein, and grace, But a right Statesman in Grimace; The Sneer, the Cringe, and then by turns, The dully grave, the Frowns, and Scorns, Promises all, but nought performs: But howe'er great he's in Promotion, He's very humble in Devotion; VVith Taper light, and Feet all bare, He to the Temple did repair, And knocking softly at the Portal, Cry'd, Pitty (Fathers) a poor Mortal, And for a Sinner make some room, A Prodigal returned home. Some say that in that very hour, Convert Mall Megs arriv'd at door; So both with penitent Grimace, States-man and Bawd with humble pace Enter'd and were receiv'd to grace. The next a Knight of high Command 'Twixt London-bridge and Dover-Sand; A Man of strict and holy Life, Taking example from his Wife; He to a Nunnery sent her packing, Lest they should take each other napping. Some say L'Est? did him beget, But that he wants his Chin and Wit; Good natur'd, as you may observe, Letting his Titular Father starve; A Man of Sense and Parts, we know it, But dares as well be damn'd as show it; Brib'd by himself, his trusty Servant At Kings-Bench-Bar appear'd most fervent Against his Honour for the Test, To him 'twas Gain, to all Mankind a Jest. Blue-Bonnet Lords a numerous store, Whose best Example is they're poor, Meerly drawn in, in hopes of Gains, And reap the scandal for their pains; Half-starv'd at Court with expectation, Forc'd to return to their Sootch Station, Despis'd and scorn'd by every Nation. A paltry Knight not worth a mention, Renounc'd his Faith for piteous Pension; After upon True Protestant Whore, H'had spent a large Estate before. A thick short Collonel next does come, With Stradling Legs and massy Bum: With many more of shameful Note, Whose Honour ne're was worth a Groat. If these be Pillars of the Church, 'Tis fear'd they'll leave her in the lurch; If abler Men do not support her Weight, All quickly will return to Forty Eight. The humble Address of your Majesty's Poet Laureat, and others your Catholick and Protestant dissenting Rhymers, with the rest of the Fraternity of Minor Poets, Inferiour Versifiers and Sonnetteers of Your Majesty's Ancient Corporation of Parnassus. Humbly Sheweth, That we your Majesty's poor slaves, Your merry Beggars, witty knaves, Being highly sensible how long And dull dry Prose addressing Throng, Have daily vext your Royal Ears With fulsom speeches, canting Prayers, Unanimously think it better T'address your Majesty in Meeter. Great Sir, your healing Declaration Has cur'd a base distemper'd Nation; The Godly hug it for the ease It gives to squeamish Consciences; And by the Mammonists, 'tis made The grand encouragement of Trade; But we must reckon it (in our sense) A gracious Poetick Licence. 'Tis your peculiar excellency, T'indulge Religion to a frensy; And our Religion is our fancy: For which, we judge 'twould be a crime, Not to present our thanks in rhime; We, with all Subjects of our mind, To pay, like us, their dues in kind: That jealous Protestants would greet With Tests and Laws your Royal Feet; That all would sacrifice in course Their stubborn Consciences to yours; That th'Academies wou'd oppose On no pretence your Royal Cause, But quit their Oaths and Founders Laws; That Corporations yield their Charters, And no more grudge your Souldiers Quarters; That Borough Towns would chuse such Men, As you shan't need send home again; That all right Members take their stations, Such as Sir Roger and Sir P? That your new Friends stand every where, Of which we recommend one pair, Honest Will Pen and Harry Care. Dissenters will with all their heart—a Vote for a Gospel Magna Charta; Your Judges too will over-awe The poor dead letter of the Law; Your High Commissioners, from whom The obstinate receive their doom, For trusty Catholicks make room. Only one resty part o'th' Nation, Wou'd bound your power of dispensation; For which we'll bait the Rogues agen, With second part of Hind and Pan: We'll Rhime 'em into better manners, And make them low'r their Paper-Banners; Nor is this all that we will do, No, Sir, we'll pray like Poets too. May our great God Apollo bless you, May Juno help your budding issue; May you attempt no enemies To skirmish with but Butterflies: Nor exercise Your Martial Arms, But in mock-sieges, false alarms. May you have long and peaceful days, And may we live to sing your Praise; And after all, may you inherit The overplus of the Saints merit. The LAUREAT. Jack Squabb, his History in little drawn Down to his Evening, from his early dawn. Appear thou mighty Bard, to open view; Which yet we must confess you need not do: The labour to expose thee we may save, Thou stand'st upon thy own Records, a Knave; Condemn'd to live in thy Apostate Rhimes, The Curse of Ours, and Scoff of Future Times. Still tacking round with every turn of State Reverse to Sh?ry thy cursed Fate Is always at a change to come to late: To keep his plots from Coxcombs was his Care, His Policy was mask'd, and thine is bare: Wise Men alone cou'd guess at his Design, And cou'd but guess, the Thred was spun so fine: But every pur-blind Fool may see through thine. Had Dick still kept the Regal Diadem, Thou hadst been Poet Laureat to him, And, long ere now, in Lofty Verse proclaim'd His high Extraction, among Princes Fam'd; Diffus'd his Glorious Deeds from Pole to Pole, Where VVinds can carry, and where VVaves can rowl. Nay, had our Charles, by Heavens severe Decree, Been found, and Murther'd in the Royal Tree, Even thou hadst prais'd the Fact; his Father slain, Thou call'dst but gently breathing of a Vein: Impious, and Villanous! to bless the blow That laid at once three lofty Nations low, And gave the Royal Cause a fatal Overthrow. VVhat after this cou'd we expect from thee? VVhat cou'd we hope for, but just what we see? Scandal to all Religions, New and Old; Scandal to thine, where Pardon's bought and sold, And Mortgag'd Happiness redeem'd for Gold: Tell me, for 'tis a Truth you must allow; VVho ever chang'd more in one Moon, than thou? Even thy own Zimri was more stedfast known, He had but one Religion, or had none: VVhat sect of Christians is't thou hast not known, And at one time or other made thy own? A Bristled Baptist bred; and then thy strain Immaculate, was free from sinful stain. No Songs in those blest times thou didst produce To brand, and sham good manners out of use: The Ladies then had not one Bawdy Bob, Nor thou the Courtly Name of Poet Squab. Next, thy dull Muse, an Independent Jade, On sacred Tyranny five Stanza's made, Prais'd Noll, who ev'n to both extreams did run, To kill the Father, and dethrone the Son. VVhen Charles came in, thou didst a Convert grow, More by thy Interest, than thy Nature so. Under his livening Beams thy Laurels spread; He first did place that wreath about thy Head; Kindly reliev'd thy wants, and gave thee Bread. Here 'twas thou mad'st the Bells of Fancy chime, And choak'd the Town with suffocating Rhime. Till Heroes form'd by thy Creating Pen, VVere grown as cheap, and Dull, as other Men. Flush'd with success, full Gallery, and Pit, Thou bravest all Mankind with want of VVit. Nay, in short time, wer't grown so proud a Ninny, As scarce t'allow that Ben himself had any. But when the men of Sense thy Error saw, They check'd thy Muse, and kept the Termagant in awe. To Satyr next thy Talent was Addrest, Fell foul on all, thy friends among the rest: Those who the oft'nest did thy wants supply, Abus'd, Traduc'd, without a reason why. Nay, ev'n thy Royal Patron was not spar'd, But an obscene, a santring wretch declar'd. Thy Loyal Libel we can still produce, Beyond Example, and beyond Excuse. O strange return, to a forgiving King, But the warm'd Viper wears the greatest Sting. Thy Pension lost, and justly without doubt, VVhen Servants snarl, we ought to kick 'em out; They that disdain their Benefactors Bread, No longer ought by Bounty to be fed. That lost, the Vizor chang'd, you turn about, And strait a True-blue Protestant crept out; The Frier now was writ; and some will say They smell a Male-content through all the Play. The Papist too was damn'd, unfit for Trust, Call'd Treacherous, Shameless, Profligate, Unjust, And Kingly Power thought Arbitrary Lust. This lasted till thou didst thy Pension gain, And that chang'd both thy Morals, and thy strain. If to write Contradictions, Nonsense be, VVho has more Nonsense in their VVorks than thee? VVe'll mention but thy Lay-mans Faith, and Hind, VVho'd think both these (such clashing do we find) Cou'd be the product of one single mind: Here, thou wou'dst Charitable fain appear, Find'st fault that Athanasius was severe; Thy Pity strait to Cruelty is rais'd, And even the pious Inquisition prais'd, And recommended to the present Reign. “O happy Countries, Italy and Spain! Have we not cause, in thy own words, to say, Let none believe what varies every day, That never was, nor will be at a stay. Once, Heathens might be sav'd, you did allow; But not, it seems, we greater Heathens now: The Loyal Church, that buoys the Kingly Line, Damn'd with a breath, but 'tis such breath as thine: What credit to thy party can it be, T'have gain'd so lewd a Profligate as thee? Stray'd from our Fold, makes us but laugh, not weep; We have but lost what was disgrace to keep: By them Mistrusted, and to us a scorn; For it is weakness, at the best to turn. True, hadst thou left us in the former Reign, T'had prov'd, it was not wholly done for Gain; Now, the Meridian Sun is not so plain. Gold is thy God, for a substantial summ, Thou to the Turk, wouldst run away from Rome, And sing his Holy Expedition against Christendom. But to conclude, blush with a lasting Red, (If thou'rt not mov'd with what's already said) To see thy Boars, Bears, Buzards, Wolves and Owls, And all thy other Beasts, and other Fowls, Routed by two poor Mice: (Unequal fight) But easie 'tis to Conquer in the Right. See there a Youth (a shame to thy gray hairs) Make a meer Dunce of all thy threescore years. What in that tedious Poem hast thou done, But cramm'd all Æsops Fables into one. But why do I the precious minutes spend On him, that wou'd much rather hang, than mend. No, Wretch, continue still just as thou art, Thou'rt now in this last Scene, that Crowns thy part; To purchase Favour, veer with every Gale, And against Interest never cease to rail; Tho thou'rt the only proof how Interest can prevail. The Vision of Toleration. Last Night, when I my self to sleep had laid; Whilst bones did rest, my roving busie Head Methought, had strangely carry'd me from home, And I (the Lord knows how) was got to Rome; It happen'd to be on a publick day, When Pope and Cardinals were met; not to pray, That's not their business, but to hold Debates, How to Rule Kings, and how to Govern States. Most strange Employments sure for Gospel Preachers, The Apostles were not Rulers, but Mens Teachers. When Tripple Crown had took St. Peter's Chair, (He little thought a Crown should e'er come there:) The rest to their respective seats repair; And the first matter they did fall upon, Was the Affairs of th'Isle call'd Albion: Methought an horned Legate did present In Parchment fair ingross'd, a long complaint, Against the Monster call'd a Parliament: Which being softly read, Christ's Vicar cries, Who th'plague has open'd these damn'd Her'ticks eyes? I thought the sugar'd promise at first made To them, would the believing Fools perswade Out of their Bread and Butter; but since jealous Of Privilege, and for their Church so zealous; Since we can't overturn this Impious Test, Of all methods beyond dispute the best: Since Shams won't take, What must the next be done, Against our Rival Church of Albion? His Reverend speech thus ended, whilst each mind Was busied, some new Stratagem to find; Ere any spake, there strangely did appear One cloath'd in black, and stood before the Chair; All Eyes upon him fixt, and all Tongues mute, With a feign'd Voice he did them thus salute: Hail! Reverend Patriarch, and ye that are Worthy Assistants of St. Peter's Chair: I from the Author of your Faith am come, From him first plac'd th'unerring Chair in Rome; Who gave judicial power to pardon sins, And to Depose the Unbelieving Kings: Who you out of your senses does perswade, Not to discern Flesh, Blood, and Bones from Bread; Who is your Churches best Friend and Physician, To cure her Schisms by Holy Inquisition: Who taught you burning was the Remedy, Lawful to purge the Church from Heresie: French Nero taught to manage Hugonaut: He who all your new Articles has taught; From him I come, and by Commission tell, Right Trusty and Belov'd, he greets you well; Extremely pleas'd with your great pains and care, T'increase his Kingdom, in this grand Affair Of Albion. It is his will and pleasure, That to perfect the Work, you take this measure; You know as well as he, that in that Nation, Are many Bastard slips of th'Reformation; Who, with their Sister have been still at odds, Because (I wish 'twere true) she serv'd your Gods. But seeing their mistake, they now begin To have a good opinion, and come in To her Communion; and she thereby Grows daily a more potent enemy. Now to prevent a Reconciliation, He bids declare an Act of Toleration; Let Independant, Presbyter, and Quaker, With Anabaptist, Muggletonian, Seeker, Sweet Singer, Family of Love, Fifth-Monarchy; Give all these whimsy-heads their Liberty, They'll with each other fall at enmity: And all against the Church, confirm'd by Law, Though for no other cause, but 'cause tis so. If you can but perswade them to Rebel, Th'King has an Army will make all things well; In these Directions Expeditious be, Your time's but short, J. R's past Fifty three. His well invented Speech thus having ended, He in a flash of Brimstone fire descended. They seeing him to vanish in that fashion, Cry'd out, that 'twas a Divine Revelation. At which I wondred, for I did not know, Till then, that Roman Gods had dwelt below. First sight, I thought him Jesuit, but when I saw the Cloven-Foot concluded then He was th'old accuser of the Brethren. VVhen they a while had on his Speech reflected, They all agreed 't should be as 'twas directed. One only, cry'd, more grave, and full of sense, VVe our designs must colour with pretence; VVe'll say 'tis tender Consciences to ease, And to preserve the Government in peace, VVhich all lik'd well; and bade, 't should be Ingrost, And sent unto the Nuncio by the Post: After which order to the Secretary, They all concluded with an Ave Mary. On the Bishops Confinement. Where is there Faith and Justice to be found? Sure the VVorld trembles, Nature's in a swound; To see her pious Sons design'd to fall A victim to Religion; Truth, and all The charms of Piety are no defence Against the new-found power, that can dispence VVith Laws to murder sacred Innocence: Surely, unless some pitying God look down, And stem this torrent, it will down Divinity it self.— The Bishops Prisoners! Can we tamely see Those Reverend Prelates bow the knee To Antichrist? No, mighty Monarch, no, Though we must pay to Cæsar what we owe, There is a power supream, by which you live; VVhose Arm is longer, and Prerogative Larger by far than yours; whose very word Can blast your hopes, and turn your two-edg'd sword; Can make his Secular Vice-gerent know, Virtue, like Palms deprest, do higher grow. Though Rob'd in all the Grandeur of your State, Courtiers, like radiant Stars, about you wait: 'Midst of your glorious joys, when you put on That awful presence which becomes a Throne; Belshazzar like, three Words upon the Wall Shall blast your Joys, and make your Glories fall. His Holiness, that Patriot of strife, Though he can grant you Pardons, cannot Life. Arise then, Mighty Sir, in God-like mien, As of thy Valour, let thy Truth be seen; Free from mistrust, let all your words be clear; By actions, let your promises appear: Protect that Church which brought you to the Crown; You know 'tis great and honourable to own A kindness done; but to reward with death That happy instrument that gave you breath, Is mean, and might a Cath'licks Conscience sting, To cut the hand off that Anoints you King. The Last Will and Testament of Father Peters. I In his Holiness Name, With Amen I proclaim My last Will and Testament following: Who in body am well, But in mind monstrous ill; While in dismal Dispair I am wallowing. II My Soul I bequeath, To the Regions beneath; It has long to the Devil been due: To be tortur'd in pain, More than I did ordain To inflict on the Heretick Crew. III My Body a Pledge, I give to the Sledge, To ride on't to Tyburn in state: And there in a Cart, Before I depart, All my Villanous Actions relate. IV When the Rout I've harrang'd, To submit to be Hang'd; And ere dead to be cut down and Quarter'd: While each Blockhead and Whore Dips a Clout in my Gore, To proclaim to the World I am Martyr'd. V My Politick Head With my Quarters when Dead, Each one to be perch'd on a Pole; Thus by Prophetick Spirit, According to Merit, I've dispos'd of my Body and Soul. VI And next I declare, Not to mention an Heir, My Executors wholly and full, To cut off all other, The Spark and his Mother, VVho three Politick Nations wou'd Gull. VII My Funeral Charge, As it will not be large, So 'twill take up less room in my VVill: But were it much more, Since I die on this score, They'll never be troubled with Bill. VIII It may do 'em both good For all their High Blood, 'Tis Full Threescore thousand compleat: As I got it by Fools, So I leave it to Tools, While the Church and Relations I Cheat. IX My Books, tho' not many, For I never lov'd any, They may keep for their private Occasions; They're of Riddles and Dreams, From whence I took Theams To furnish my self with Orations. X The rest of my Stuff, Since they have enough, I Bequeath to a pretty young Sinner; 'Twill furnish a Room To practise at Home, And encourage a happy Beginner. XI I'll not give 'em the Trouble To pay the Priests double, To fetch me from Purgatory: For that, like the rest Of our Creed, is a Jest; And as true as the Song of John Dory. XII For if there's a Hell, I deserve it so well I need not despair of the Place; And none but an Ass Will believe that the Mass, Can ever restore him to Grace. XIII I confess they are fools, Which our Church daily gulls, And particularly with this Nation: Such as when they do Pray, Know not one word they say, 'Tis their Ignorance helps their Devotion. XIV But I am wide of my Text, Being damnably vext To see how the Jesuits are fool'd; And your prospects of peace Do my Torments increase, More than losing my Life and my Gold. XV On our Brotherhood all May my last blessing fall, And on every Monk, Friar and Priest; May they ere 'tis too late Partake of my Fate, And become every Hereticks Jest. XVI I wou'd have Enlarg'd, But my Conscience discharg'd, I'll here make an end of my Sermon, And wish all this Throng May be damn'd, Old and Young, And so drive away, Honest Carman. The Pope's WISH. To the Tune of the Old Mans's Wish. If I wear out of date, as I find I fall down, For my Chair it is rotten, and shakes like my Crown; Tho I be an Impostor, may this be my doom, Let my Spiritual Market continue at Rome: May the words of my mouth the Nations betray, Till Monarchs and Princes my Sceptre obey; To feed on the fat, and the lean ones to flay: And the lean ones to flay. Tho my Birth be equivocal, I look like a Bear; My Tribe they be cloath'd with sackcloath and hair, (A Hypocrites habit, and fit to deceive) Let no man decypher the Pope for a knave. May the words of my mouth, &amp;c. Tho my Actions be wicked, my Principles ill, May I be reputed his Holiness still; With the Keys on my Arm to chink like a Bell, And Conjure a Soul for Gold out of Hell. May the words of my mouth, &amp;c. With a pair of Great Princes, both lazy and idle, The one to hold Stirrup, the other the Bridle; And when they have done, for their pains let 'em take A kick on the breech, and a stamp on the neck. May the words of my mouth, &amp;c. May I be adored by better and worse: Let Kings kiss my Toe, and Mah'met mine A?e. May Pardons give price, and Indulgences sell, And every Opposer be turn'd into Hell. May the words of my mouth, &amp;c. Let the spiritual Peddlers, the Priests tell a story, Of Limbus Infantum, and New Purgatory, T extinguish Sedition, and blow out Contention; To work all my Miracles by apprehension. May the words of my mouth, &amp;c. May the Church-men and Clergy ne're Marry nor Wed, But hug the old Harlot that's cast in a Bed, Let the Friars with the Nuns commit Fornication, (If sin) tis but Venial, and sweet Recreation. May the words of my mouth, &amp;c. May the Priests at Confession make a Virgin to fall, And when she gets up, give her Pardon for all; Let Bawds have their Trade, and Whores have their pleasure, To fill (with their fleshly) my Spiritual Treasure. May the words of my mouth, &amp;c. And whate're I do, or whate're befals me, He's a Spiritual Traitor, that Whoremonger calls me; By Bell, Book, and Candle, I'll bar him from Glory, And send him to Hell, or at least Purgatory. May the words of my mouth, &amp;c. Let the Saints at devotion make Prayers for the Dead, And least they misreckon, count all by a Bead. With Pictures in Churches, that people may pray To Idols compos'd of Stone, Wood, and Clay. May the words of my mouth, &amp;c. With a Lamp Everlasting that burneth for ever, Of the poor Widows Oil, which providence gives her; With St. Anthony's Fart, that he let in a Frolick, Which smells like a Rose, and cures the Wind-colick May the words of my mouth, &amp;c. Let people be cheated, a Wafer to take, And call it a God, tho bak'd in a Cake; Let them play their Devotion at Church on a fiddle; But ne'er be so wise as to find out the Riddle. May none be so bold my words to despise, Till I dull all Mens ears, and hood-wink their eyes, And blind the whole World with fopperies and lyes. The Protestant Litany. From Religion that's Nonsence, and larded with lyes; From shutting the Cupbord, and chinking the Keys; From Light that ascendeth like smoak to the Skies; Good Lord deliver us. From a Pope that's in Passion, and bendeth his Wits For Plots, and Conspiracies, digging of Pits; From a people that crameth their God in their Guts; Good Lord deliver us. From Spain's Inquisition, and Scarlet attire; From zeal that is kindled with Faggot and Fire; From a Priest that Dispenseth his Pardons for Hire; Good Lord deliver us. From Wine that's Converted to poison for blood; From the Dragon's breath, and venemous flood; From Babylon's Brats, and all the Beasts brood; Good Lord deliver us. From a Feminine Pope, of the Epicene Gender, From Joan who did drink to the Devil her attender; From him who's of fopperies (for faith) the Defender; Good Lord deliver us. From unprofitable Servants, who Heaven do merit, Who Preach the true Gospel, denying the Spirit; And think by their fool'ries Salvation t'inherit; Good Lord deliver us. From a Queen clad in Scarlet, that looks like a Witch; From those who for Penance must whip their own Breech; From her that needs brimstone to cure her old itch; Good Lord deliver us. From a Beast that is spotted, and snuffs up the Air, With a Mouth like a Lion, and Feet like a Bear; From Garments deceitful, composed of Hair; Good Lord deliver us. From Beggars who're Rich, and beg for the poor; From Kings without Kingdoms, that Reign but an hour; From the Grape of Gomorrha, that's sweet, and yet sower; Good Lord deliver us. From Leo the Coward, and Clement the Clown; From Pius the wicked, that's veil'd with a Gown; From fools out of fashion, and shav'd in the Crown. Good Lord deliver us. From Roma diu titubans, ready to spue; From Locusts and Frogs, and Babylons crew; From the Prophet, or tail which the Stars backward drew; Good Lord deliver us. From a Shepherd whose crook is knob'd like a Club, The one end to catch, the other to rub; And one who his Sheep of their Fleece does rob: Good Lord deliver us. Advice to the Prince of Orange, and the Packet-Boat returned. Adv. The year of wonder now is come, A Jubilee proclaim at Rome; The Church has pregnant made the Womb. Pac. No more of the admired year, No more of Jubilee declare; All Trees that blossom do not bear. Adv. Orange give o're your hopes of Crowns, And yield to France the Belgick Towns; And keep your Fleet out of the Downs. Pac. We'll wait for Crowns, not Interest quit, Let Lewis take what he can get; And do not you proscribe our Fleet. Adv. Ye talk of Eighty Men of War, Well Rigg'd and Mann'd you say they are; 'Twas joyful News when it came here. Pac. Well may the sound of Eighty Sail, Make England's greatest Courage fail; When half the number will prevail. Adv. But we have some upon the Stocks, And others laid up in our Docks; Well fitted out, would match your Cocks. Pac. Tack not as if you'd match our Cocks, And Launch your few Ships on the Stocks; And if you can, secure your Docks. Adv. Besides, we've call'd our Subjects home, Which in your Fleet and Army rome, But you, they say, won't let them come. Pac. Your Subjects, in our Camp and Fleet, Whom you with Proclamation greet, Will all obey, when they think fit. Adv. Souldiers and Seamen both we need, Old England's quite out of the breed; Feather and Scarf won't do the deed. Pac. Of Men and Arms never despair, The Civiliz'd wild Irish are Couragious even to Massacre. Adv. Now, if you'd be Victorious made, Like us, on Hounslow Masquerade; Advance your Honour, and your Trade. Pac. Then take this Counsel back again, Leave off to mimick in Campaign, And fight in earnest on the Main. Adv. Buda we storm'd, and took't with ease; Do you the same upon the Seas, And then we'll meet you when you please. Pac. The storming Buda does declare, That you the glorious Off-spring are, Of them that made all Europe fear: Adv. Such Warlike Actions will at least Inspire each neighbouring Monarchs breast, Till Lewis shall compleat the rest. Pac. Such Camp, such Siege, and such sham Shews, Make each small State your power oppose, And Lewis lead you by the Nose. The Hieroglyphick. Come Painter, take a prospect from this Hill, And on a well-spread Canvas shew thy Skill: Draw all in Colours as they shall appear, And as they stand in merit place them there. Draw, as the Heralds do, a spacious Field; And, as directed, so let that fill'd. First, draw a Popish Army brisk and gay, Fighting, and beat, destroy'd, and run away. Then draw a Hearse, and let it stand in view, The Mourners more, far more than they're in shew, Cursing their Fate, their Stars, and in that fear, Shew, if thou canst, how those damn'd Sots prepare To run, or stay and skulk in holes alone: By them, this Motto, Gallows claim thy own. Now, to the Life, let thy brisk Pencil shew Distinctly what they are, and what's their due. Now draw a crowd of Priests prepar'd to run, Like broken Merchants when their stock is gone; Some howling out their Prayers, forget and say, Save us St. Ketch: Are all our Saints away? Draw them in hurry, running to and fro, Posting to Dover, Portsmouth, Tyburn too. Next draw a croud of Lords. This Label by, The great Design is lost. Alas, they cry, Who'd serve a Cause of such curst Destiny? Now draw four Priests, shew how they Rome adore, And each mans Scarf hang to be seen before. Two brace of Bishops, fallen to despair, Arm'd Cap-a-pe, but running God knows where. Now shew the Judges, and with them thy skill, That all who see it done, may say, 'tis well; In Caps and Gowns, as they in order sate 'Twixt Heaven and Earth do thou them elevate; For their grave Noddles can dispence with that. Now draw the little Rogues, the Scoundrel Crew, Knights, Knaves, and Beggars, they must have their due, G?db?ry, B?ler, ay, and others too. Amidst thus croud, on a fit spot of Land, To crown the work, let a large Gallows stand; All trembling by, arm'd with their guilt and fears, Kneel to this Image, and pour out their Prayers, And then die by Suffocation. To the ten Dispensing Judges. Dignify'd things, may I your leaves implore, To kiss your hands, and your high Heads adore; Judges you are, but you are something more. May I draw near, and with a rough-hew'd Pen, Give a small Draught of you, the worst of men: Tell of your merits, and your mighty skill, And how your Charms all Courts of Justice fill. Your Laws, far stronger than the Commons Votes, So finely flow from your Dispensing Throats. What Rome will ask, you must not her deny: If Hell command you too, you must comply. There's none but you would in this Cause combine, Things made like men, but act like brutes and swine. Law-books are trash, a Student he's a Drudge: Learn to say, Yes, he's an accomplish'd Judge; He wins the Scarlet Robe, and wears it too: Ay, and deserves it well, for more's his due; All that compleats a Traytor dwells in you. Thus you like Villains to the Benches get; And in defiance to the Laws, you sit, And all base actions that will please commit: There must you toil for Rome, and also try Your Irish Sense, and Cobweb Policy, Compleat your Crimes; and then you're fit to die. True Loyal Babes! Pimps to the Church of Rome, Tresilian's Heirs: Heirs to his crimes and doom. Was e'er the Hall fill'd up with such a Brood, All dipt in Treason, Villanies or Blood: Worse than Fanatick Priests, for they being prest By a wise Prince, Preach'd to Repeal the Test. Then here's the difference, 'twixt you Popish Tools, You're downright Rogues, they only Knaves and Fools. Religious Relicks: Or, the Sale at the Savoy, upon the Jesuites breaking up their School and Chappel. I Last Sunday, by chance, I encounter'd with Pr?e, That Man of upright Conversation, Who told me such News, That I could not chuse But laugh at his sad Declaration. II Says he, if you'll go, You shall see such a show, Of Reliques expos'd to be sold, Which from sin and disease, Will purge all that please To lay out their Silver and Gold. III Straight with him I went, Being zealously bent, Where for sixpence the man let me in; But the Crowd was so great, I was all in a Sweat, Before the rare show did begin: IV The Curtain being drawn, Which I think was of Lawn, The Priest cross'd himself thrice, and bow'd; Then with a sour Face, Denoting his case, He address'd himself thus to the Crowd: V You see our sad State, 'Tis a folly to prate, Our Church and our Cause is a-ground; So in short, if you've Gold, Here is to be sold For a Guinea the worth of ten Pound. VI Here's St. James's Old Bottle, It holds just a Pottle, With the Pilgrims Habit he wore; The same Scollop Shells, As our Holy Church tells, Who denies it's a Son of a W? VII Here's a piece of the Bag, By Age turn'd to a Rag, In which Judas the Money did bear; With a part of his Rope, Bequeath'd to the Pope, As an Antidote 'gainst all Despair. VIII Here's a Rib of St: Laurence, 'Tis also at Florence, And it may be in France, or in Spain; It cures Stone and Gravel, And Women in Travel, And delivers without any pain. IX Here's St. Joseph's Old Coat, Though scarce worth a Groat, It's plainness does shew he'd no Pride; Yet this he had on, For besides it he'd none, The day that he Marry'd his Bride. X His Breeches are there, A plain Leather pair, Come buy the whole Suit, if you please; They'll defend you from th'Itch, From Hag, and from Witch, And preserve you from Buggs and from Fleas. XI Here's the Gall of a Saint, For such as do faint, Or are troubl'd with Fits of the Mother; Nay, if your breath stink, Worse than Close-stool or Sink, It will cure you as soon as the other. XII Here's a Prayer of Pope John, The like to't is none, If you say it but three times a year; Three hundred in Grace, And three hundred 'twill place In Heaven, if they ever come there. XIII Here's our Ladies old Shoe, Which in Old time was new, It will cure all your Kibes and your Corns; With the Coif of St. Bridget, To be worn by each Idiot, Whose Head is tormented with Horns. XIV Here's a bottle of Tears, Preserv'd many years, Of Mary's that once was a Sinner; Some o'th' Fish and the Bread, That the five thousand fed, Which our Saviour invited to Dinner. XV Here's St. Francis own Cord, You may take't on my word, Who dies in it cannot be Damn'd; Do but buy it, and try, If I tell you a lye, Many thousands of Heaven are shamm'd. XVI Here's his Holiness's beard, Of whom you have heard, That the Hereticks called Pope Joan; Yet this I dare swear, Was his natural Hair, Or else I'll be sworn he had none. XVII It's Vertue is such, That if it does touch Your Head, or your Face, or elsewhere, It does straitway restore, More than e're was before, Though by Age or by Action worn bare. XVIII Here's St. Christopher's Boot, For his Right Leg and Foot, Which he wore when he ply'd at the Ferry, When on's shoulders he bore His blessed Lord o're, For the poor man had never a Wherry. XIX Such as sail on the Seas, I am sure it will please, For its parallel never was found; Neither Tempest nor Storm, Can e'er do them harm, Nor is't possible they should be drown'd. XX Here's infinite more, I have by me in store, All which lye conceal'd in this Hamper; Either buy them to day, Or I'll throw them away, For to morrow, by Heaven, I'll scamper. XXI Our Market is done, We must shut up at Noon, VVe expect them each hour at the Door; VVe are Hang'd if we stay, And we can't get away, For none will, nor dare carry us o're. XXII But by th'Faith of a Priest, This is no time to jest, Since we are baulk'd in our great Expectation; Before I will swing, Like a Dog in a string, I'll Renounce the Transubstantiation. Private Occurrences: Or, the Transactions of the four last Years. Written in Imitation of the Old Ballad of Hey brave Oliver, Ho brave Oliver, &amp;c. I A Protestant Muse, yet a Lover of Kings; On th'Age, grown a little Satyrical, sings, Of Papists, their Counsels, and other fine things. Sing hey brave Popery, horare Popery, oh fine Popery, Oh dainty Popery, oh. II She hopes she offends no Englishman's patience; Tho Satyr's forbid on all such occasions, She's too good a subject to read Declarations. Sing hey brave Popery, &amp;c. III If the saying be good, of Let him laugh that Wins, Sure a loser may smile without any offence; My Muse then is gamesome, and thus she begins; With hey brave Popery, &amp;c. IV VVhen Ch? deceas'd, to his Kingdoms dismay, By an Apoplex, or else some other way: Our brother with shouts was proclaim'd the same day. Sing hey brave Popery, &amp;c. V His first Royal promise was never to touch Our Rights, nor Religion, nor priviledge grutch: But Pet? swore Dam him, he granted too much. Sing hey brave Popery, &amp;c. VI Then Mon? came in with an Army of Fools, Betray'd by his Cuckold, and other dull Tools, That painted the Turf of Geen Sedgmore with Gules. Sing hey brave Popery, &amp;c. VII That Victory gotten, some think to our wrong, The Priests bray'd out Joy in a Thanksgiving Song, And Teague with the Bald-pates were at it ding dong. Sing hey brave Popery, &amp;c. VIII Then straight a strong Army was Levy'd in haste, To hinder Rebellion; a very good Jest, For some Rogues will swear 'twas to murder the Test. Sing hey brave Popery, &amp;c. IX A Politick Law which Recusants did doom, That into our Senate they never might come; But Equivalent since, was propos'd in its room. Sing hey brave Popery, &amp;c. X As if a true Friend should in kindness demand A Tooth in my Head, which firmly doth stand, To give for't another he had in his Hand. Sing hey brave Popery, &amp;c. XI Then Term after Term, this great matter was weigh'd, Old Judges turn'd out, and new Block?ds made; That Cook or wise Littleton never did read. Sing hey brave Popery, &amp;c. XII The good Ch. of England withspeed was run down, VVhose Loyalty ever stood fast to the Crown; And Presbyter John was made Mayor of the Town. Sing hey brave Popery, &amp;c. XIII The Bishops Disgrace made the Clergy to sob: A Prey to Old Pet? and President Bob; And hurried to Prison as if they did Rob. Sing hey brave Popery, &amp;c. XIV Then into the world a dear P? of W?s slipt; 'Twas plain, for we hear a great Minister peep'd: The Bricklayer for prating had like t'a bin whipp'd. Sing hey brave Popery, &amp;c. XV Thus England's distresses more fierce than the Plague, That during three years, of no Quiet could brag. The Prince Van Auraignia has brought from the Hague. Sing hey brave Popery, &amp;c. XVI A strong Fleet and Army t'Invade us are bent; We know not the Cause, tho there is something in't: But we doubt not, e're long we shall see it in Print. Sing hey brave Popery, &amp;c. XVII Ah England, that never couldst value thy Peace: Had matters been now as in Elsabeth's Days, The Dutch had ne're ventur'd to Fish in our Seas. Then Curse of Popery, pox o' Popery, plague o' Popery, Oh Senseless Popery, oh. On PURGATORY. When the Almighty first his Palace fram'd, That Glorious shining place he Heaven nam'd; And when the first Rebellious Angels fell, He Doom'd them to a certain place call'd Hell. There's Heaven and Hell confirm'd in sacred story, But yet I ne're could read of Purgatory: That cleansing place, which of late years is found, For sinning Souls to Flux in till they're sound. In imitation of which 'tis said, They have the Hummums and the Bagnio's made, Two Purgatories of a quicker Trade. There one days Sufferance cures the worst that comes, And thence they are releas'd for easie Sums. Oh! Rome, for Price and Time thou'rt too severe, Keeping an honest Monarch in two year, That never yet deserv'd to come there. Priests found out this for good of human Race; Th'Almighty never thought of such a place. Oh! Rome, thou art a wise and learned Nation, To add a place wanting in Gods Creation. A Stanza lately put upon Tyburn. Hail Reverend Tripos, Guardian of the Law; Sacred to Justice, Treasons greatest awe! Do thou decide the Nations weighty Cause, And judge between the Judges and the Laws. So shall no guiltless blood thy Timber e're pollute, But Righteous Laws shall vouch all thou shalt execute. Harry Care's last Will and Testament. Not Hell it self, nor Gloomy Fate, can save The lewdest sinner from his Destin'd Grave: But all the sooty Surges once must try, Old Charon's Boat's a certain Destiny. This Harry found, whose moldring Corps did call For Physick props t'uphold the human Wall; Thinking himself to Ne plus ultra come, He thought of Winding Sheets, and of his Tomb: Summun'd his glorious Kindred to appear, To see his last, and his last Will to hear, The Weeping Crowd the mournful Chamber fill, While he in dying Accents makes his Will. Imprimis, for my Soul (if such I have) I wish it buried with me in my Grave: For if what great Divines do preach and tell, Be real Verities of Heaven and Hell, Down to the gloomy Shores I surely go, The same I serv'd above must serve below. And next, for my dear Wife, who Weeps my fall, And is chief Mourner at my Funeral; My sole Executrix I do here make, And let her all my Goods and Chattels take: Besides, my Province too let her command, That undiscover'd lies in Fairy-Land. To her my unsold Pamphlets I bequeath, To buy her Brandy and Tobacco with: And if she do a Male or Stallion take, I hope he'll use her kindly for my sake; With equal Strength the Marriage-Yoke she'll draw, If he but drench her well with Usquebah. My Daughter next, the Off-spring of my Bed, I pour a double Blessing on her Head; The only Legacy I can bestow, And more than Heaven gave me here below: May she the Irish Witness wed, and raise A Race of Evidences for our Cause. And for those kinder Folks that propt my Pains, I freely leave them both my Pen and Brains: May they my little Artifices use, To raise up Factious, and the Crowd amuse, Till being doubly dipt in Infamy, Like me unpityed, and unenvy'd die. Now to the numerous Crowd that do's survive, I only can my dying Counsel give: The Western Emissaries I approve, And even dying do declare my Love. I charge them to stand firm unto their Trust, Accounting what's their Interest, to be Just. The Females I commend to Brother Cox, Who if he cannot cure, can give the Pox; And may he still the vigorous warmth retain, T'impart to stroaling She in Street or Lane. I've nothing more to give to all the rest, But leave Ten Thousand Curses on the Test: And who do its Abolishing withstand, I leave upon them an Eternal Brand. And for the Penal Laws they like so well, I'le write for their Repeal when I'm in Hell; And if Damn'd Pluto's Laws are like to these, I'll quickly sue him out a Writ of Ease, I there will my Occurrence truly state, Whilst some Infernal L???kin Prints the Cheat; I Hells black Tyrant will both sooth and praise, And even in Sulp'rous Styx Sedition raise. A New SONG. [Wou'd you be a Man of Favour?] Wou'd you be a Man of Favour? VVou'd you have your Fortune kind? VVear the Cross and eat the VVafer, And you'l have all things t'your Mind. If the Priest cannot convert you, Interest then must do the thing: There be Friars can inform you How to please a Popish King. VVou'd you see the Papist Lowring, Lost in a hurry and a fright, And there Father Peters scouring, Glad of Times for happy Flight. Stay but till the Dutch are Landed, And the Show will soon appear; VVhen th'Infernal Court's disbanded, Few will stay for Harbour here. A new Catch in praise of the Reverend Bishops. True Englishmen, drink a good Health to the Mitre; Let our Church ever Flourish tho her Enemies Spight Her: May their Cunning and Forces no longer prevail, And their Malice, as well as their Arguments, fail. Then remember the Seven which supported our Cause, As Stout as our Martyrs, and as Just as our Laws. A new SONG. [To our once Loyal Town, is lately come down] To the Tune of, Packintons Pound. [I] To our once Loyal Town, is lately come down, Such an Hodge-Podge of Benchers, as never wore Gown: Saints, sit for the Legend of Romes Pseudo-Martyrs, VVho have pawn'd th'Old Religion, to purchase New-Charters; To promote Publick Faith, they are zealously bent, And Bugger Geneva to Fructifie Trent. When Satan was squeamish, and long'd for a Dainty, The Pope Fricassed him this New Four-and twenty, II The first a State-Jockey, bred up of a Groom, Twixt a Colchester-Mare, and a Stallion of Rome. He Cants when at Hollet's, on Hopkins his Metre, And drops Pater-Nosters with Lowick and Petre: Thus he Banters Non-Cons with Prophane Masquerade, And quacks on the Gospel to force a lost Trade. When Satan was squeamish, &amp;c. III The next Cacafugo, once a Captain of Peace, At the sight of cold Iron he melts in his Grease; Yet he looks Indignation, and huffs like an Hector; He VVhores like an Abbot, and drinks like a Rector. The third Nicodemus, a Seeker by Night; St. The 4th Father Whitebread, who halts for New Light. When Satan was squeamish, &amp;c. IV The fifth and the sixth, two precise Renegades; B. and A. The one Jack of Diamonds, the other of Spades: For Orphans and VVidows they beautifie Cloysters, And swallow their Houses, as Barnacle Oysters; But no Dish so fit when his Holiness treats, As an A great Italian Dish. Oleopodrido of Zealots and Cheats. When Satan was squeamish, &amp;c. V Next formal Sir Foplin, who often has slunk, M. VVith a Tester at Rose's to purchase a Punk, But if Porter or Carman be possest of his Doxy, He adopts his kind Hostess her spiritual Proxy. Thus a Puritan Lecher (though with a lewd Slut) May solace the Spirit, while the Flesh goes to Rut. When Satan was squeamish, &amp;c. VI Lo here Fat St. Lean Jeff. Gog and Magog at once represent The prophane Carnaval, and Idolatrous Lent; Both Teckelites true, as were Oa[illeg.]mins in the Plot. Titus and Eustace; The Guts of good Manners, and Garbage of Justice: But nothing more proper to vacuate Laws, Than the Mouth of Rebellion, and Rump of the Cause. When Satan was squeamish, &amp;c. VII Advance Ruffling Dick to supply the next place, C. VVho on a bad Matter oft shams a worse Face: VVhen the Algerine Caper has boarded his Frigat, He can fawn like a Floater, and cringe like a Bigot. VVell the good natur'd Wittal may wink at his Fate. Since he that Cornutes him has bugger'd the State. When Satan was squeamish, &amp;c. VIII VVe'll refer Young Tertullus t'a Bill of Review, Lest he shou'd Repeal what he never yet knew: His VVorship we'll leave to his new Breviaries, 'Till One Miserere's worth Ten Avemaries; For a Janus-like Convert, who in Faith interlopes, Like a Cordeliar-Friar, must be sav'd by his Ropes. When Satan was squeamish, and long'd for a Dainty, The Pope Fricassed him this new Four-and-twenty. A New Song of the Mayor being tossed in a Blanket, in the North. To the Tune of Packington's Pound. From the farthermost part of the North we have News Of a Man of some Note that receiv'd an Abuse: For a Dog to be toss'd in a Blanket, 'tis known, But alas, what is that to the Mayor of a Town? For a great Magistrate To be us'd at that rate, All the World must allow It is very hard Fate. Ah! is it not strange? Amongst Wonders we rank it, That a Mayor of a Town shou'd be toss'd in a Blanket. Had a drunken Tom Tinker the Penance receiv'd, Or a Vintner for stumming his Wine, who'd have griev'd? Had they bolted a Baker for making light Bread, Or a Taylor for snipping a Yard for a Shred; Had it been but a Tapster For Nicking and Frothing, Wee'd been contented To take it for nothing. But as the Case stands, who, alass! don't resent it, And wish now 'tis done, that it might be prevented? Diogenes was said once to live in a Tub, But a Tenement of Blanket is such an odd Job For a Man of his Rank, we must study the Fact, Unless 'twas to mind him of the late Woollen Act. However 'twas unkind In the midst of his State, So to trouble his Thoughts With th'Approaches of Fate. For Men when advanc'd to the height of their Glory. Have something to dream on besides Purgatory. For a new Convert in Relick to be wrapt, To secure him from Danger, it often has happ'd; But had this been such, in no story we find A Mayor to cut Capers like a Witch in the Wind; Sure there's something exceeding Must cause this Extream; Yet if we dare take it, As Old Wives do Dream, Unadvis'd mistaking between waking and sleep, He pounded the Parson instead of his Sheep: So in that cross Humour they were forc'd for to shake him, To shew him his Error as soon as they wak'd him. But now, to conclude, ah! Heaven be thanked, The Mayor had no harm that was toss'd in a Blanket. A New Song [Ho Brother Teague dost hear de Decree] The attribution of this poem is questionable. Ho Brother Teague dost hear de Decree, Lilli Burlero Bullen a la, Dat we shall have a new Debittie, Lilli Burlero, Bullen a la, Lero, lero, lero, lero, lilli Burlero Bullen a la, Lero, lero, lero, lero, lilli burlero bullen a la.

His Cap with Jocky's match'd together, Turn'd to a Beaver and a Feather; His Clay transform'd to Yellow Guilt, And Trowel to a Silver Hilt. His Lady from the Tiles and Bricks, Kidnap'd to Court in Coach and Six; Her Arms a sucking Prince embrace, (Whate'er you think) of Royal Race: A Prince, come in the Nick of Time (Bless'd Dada! 'tis a Venial Crime That shall repeal our Breach of State, While all the World congratulate, Shall, like his Sire, suppress the Just, Raise Knaves and Fools to place of Trust; T?s and V?e, who sought his Fate, Tylers and Macs, two Chits of State. But here, unhappy Babe, Alass, I cannot but lament thy Case! That Thou, fed up with Rome's strong Meat. Shou'd long for Milk of Heretick Teats! Among the Daughters was there none Worthy to Nurse a Monarch's Son, That Thou, in spight of all the Priests, Shoud'st long for Milk of Heretick Breasts? But if thy Uncle, who before Was always right, chang'd the last hour, If thy undoubted Sire, so sage, Declar'd i'th' Evening of his Age; Why shou'dst not thou, Papist so soon, Be a stanch Protestant e're Noon? This said, the Tyler laugh'd in's Sleeve, And took his Audience of Leave, The Prince who answer'd ne're a Word, That he shou'd Travel did accord; To Paris, sent to learn Grimace, To Swear and Damn with a Boon Grace. To the Haters of Popery, By what Names or Titles soever dignified or distinguished. Thus 'twas of Old: then Israel felt the Rod, When they obey'd their Kings and not their God? When they went Whoring after other Loves, To worship Idols in new planted Groves. They made their Gods of Silver, Wood and Stone, And bow'd and worshipp'd them when they had done And to compleat their Sins in every way, They made 'em things call'd Priests; Priests did I say, A Crew of Villains more Prophane than they. Hence sprung that Romish Crew, first spawn'd in Hell. Who now in vice their Pedagogues excell; Their Church consists of vicious Popes, the rest Are whoreing Nuns, and bawdy Bugg'ring Priests. A Noble Church; dawb'd with Religious Paint, Each Priest's a Stallion, every Rogue's a Saint. Come you that loath this Brood: this murthering Crew, Your Predecessors well their Mercies knew. Take courage now, and be both bold and wise; Stand for your Laws, Religion, Liberties, You have the odds, the Law is still your own, They're but your Traytors, therefore pull them down; They struck with fear for to destroy your Laws There, raving mad, you see they fix their paws, Because from them they fear their fatal fall, And by them Laws they know you'l hang them all: Then keep our Laws, the Penal and the rest, And give your Lives up e'er you give the Test. And thou great Church of England hold thy own, Force you they may, otherwise give up none, Robbers &amp; thieves must pay for what they've done. Let all thy mighty Pillars now appear Zealous and brave, void both of hate and fear: That Popish Fops may grin, lie cheat and whine; And curse their Faith, while all admire thine. And thou brave Oxford, Cambridge, and the rest, Great Hough and Fairfax, that durst beard the Beast. Let all the Just with thanks record their name On standing Pillars of immortal fame. Let God arise, and his Enemies perish Protestantism Reviv'd: or the Persecuting Church Triumphing. In Sable Weeds I saw a Matron clad, Whose Looks were grave, whose Countenance was sad, Pensive with care, she musing sate alone, Her State too too unhappy to bemoan: Deep bitter pangs I saw her undergo, And pay the tributary drops of woe, So wept Ducalion when he saw the State And face of Nature chang'd and desolate. By this dumb Elegy a while sh' exprest The gloomy sorrows of her troubled breast. Then heaving up her head, she silence broke, And with a heavy sigh dejected spoke. Good God! what grief surrounds my aged head! What new distracting woes I daily wed! Who am by spightful Foes in triumph led: They pierce my side with wound, they break my rest, And snatch my sucking Children from my breast: My elder Sons inhumanely they treat, My weaker ones they bubble with Deceit. Thus they insult, thus put me to disgrace, And spit their frothy Venom in my face: My growing sorrows to compleat the more, I'm flouted by a Babylonish Whore. Put me to death they can't, since Heav'n decreed I must not die, though with my Saviour bleed, But humbly should in after-times succeed: VVhat most my anxious Soul tormented hath, Is, he that should defend, betrays my Faith. Thus, thus abus'd, I'm to all Griefs betray'd, Thus my Delights are double Sorrows made. VVho e'er was curb'd by such a Concubine? Who so perplex'd? was ever grief like mine? Then she bow'd down her head, and with her tears Bedew'd the parched Earth: when streight appears A Comforter by pittying Heaven sent To raise her drooping Spirits almost spent: Who when he had respectful Homage paid, In terms obliging reverently said, Mother, I know the cause of all thy Grief, I'm sent thy Succour, and thy true Relief: Thy God has heard thy Sighs, thy faithful Prayers, And graciously receiv'd thy flowing Tears: I'll wipe them off, I'll rugged Grief expel, And usual Joy shall in thy Count'nance dwell: I've made thy haughty Domineerers bow, And own their Lives they to my bounty owe: I've foil'd them all, I have disarm'd them quite, They have the power to bark, but not to bite. To ease your pain, by th'God of Heav'n I'm sent, He acts, and I'm the Honour'd Instrument. Then she arose, Joy smiling in her Eye, And with a cheerful Voice did thus reply: Thanks gracious God, thanks thou Victorious Son, By whom I have my wonted Glory won: Rejoyce my Sons, and Hallelujahs sing Unto our Saviour, our Triumphant King. For I an Anthem will compose, and then, We'll sweetly sound it to our God. Amen. A View of the Religion of the Town: or a Sunday Mornings Ramble. [I.] On Saturday night we sate late at the Rose, Carousing a glass to our Wives Repose, After our usual Mode; Till we dank so long, That Religion came on, For we were full of the God. At Pro and Con We held till One, And then we agreed in the Close To let Wording alone, And Ramble the Town, To see how Religion grows. II. We began at the Church of Saint Peter, Whose Prebends make many Mouths water, Religion did here, Like Grave Matron appear, Neat, but not Gawdy, like Courtezan Rome, Plain, but no Slut like your Geneva Dame. She hath on an old Stuff, With a Primitive Ruff, And round the Seam of her Vest, In Musick-Notes scrawl'd all o'er, Loyalty express'd she bore, By which at her Church we guess'd. III. At the Tombs we did peep, Where the Kings were asleep, And the Choire melodiously chanted, Without any concern, As we could discern Of being Be-Quo-warranted. And we fancy, at the last cast (Sir) When among the rest They come to the Test, Saint Peter will deny his Master. IV. Then shifting our Protestant Dress, To the Royal Chappel we press, Where Religion was fine indeed, But with Facings and Fringings, With Crossings and Cringings, Entirely run up to Seed. Good God, what distraction there reign'd, Where Union in Worship was feign'd! For I spy'd a poor Maid Just come to the Trade, (For I fancy she was but a Learner) Who was but at most (Sir) Half through Pater-Noster, When the Priest was at Amen-Corner. V. Not an Irish-mans Breeches has half the Petitions We saw put up there for various Conditions, Sent to the bless'd Maid With Care and with Speed, And she soon had a Fellow-feeling, For she was not far off, But got up aloff, Most curiously drawn on the Ceiling By the Royal command; Where Verrio's great Hand (Such to the Saints is his Love) To the Virgin has given As glorious a Heaven, As that she enjoys and reigns in above. Whether like the Rogue drew her, They can tell best that knew her, Tho most men are apt to conjecture, When he drew the bless'd Maid (Moral Fancy to aid) His Mistress sat for the Picture. VI. Then, bidding Farewel to their Goddess and them, We put in at the Savoy, or New Amsterdam, Not to find our Religion, but to see some odd Sights To which Father Corker's Chappel invites. As in ours sometimes we plac'd Saints and Martyrs, So this Holy Room was surrounded with Traytors, In Halters there hung, Just so as they swung, Saint Coleman, and most of the Gang (Boy) And wa'n't it for something That's just next to nothing, Perhaps there had hung our new Envoy. The Papists Exaltation, on His Highness the Prince of Orange, His Arrival in London. Now, now, the Prince is come to Town, The Nations Dread and Hope; Who will support the Church and Throne, Against the Turk and Pope. The Folks are fled that were the Head, The prop of Popery, If all be true as it's said: Then hey Boys up go we. The Queen with her Adopted Heir, Is on her way to Rome; And all Undone, has left us here, To end the Dance at home: The Holy Fathers too are flown, Saint Petre Gregory, And if our Cause should once go down, Then hey Boys up go we. Sk?, Sh?, fled for fear, Have render'd up the Keys; And now our Magazine of War Is made the seat of Peace. The Chancellor is in the Power, A woful sight to see; And when he by the Head is lower, Then hey Boys up go we. Lord A?l and B?s, With P?s are withdrawn; The VVorld had not such Braves as these To guard the Popish throne. VVhen P? turn'd of late, VVith brawny S? Their haughty Necks submit to Fate, Then hey Boys up go we. Poulton is in Newgate fast, And some say Father Petre; If they at Tyburn Swing at last, VVho can die Martyrs greater; VVhen Father Ellis is withdrawn, VVho was so bold and free, And Conquest for his Tongue is flown, Then hey Boys up go we. The Orange grafted in White-hall, And Lucas in the Tower; The Fathers fled both great and small, 'Tis time that we should scowre. The Rabble they have eas'd the Town Of Priests and Popery; VVhen once they pull the Chappels down, Then hey Boys up go we. The Explanation. To the Tune of, Hey Boys up go we. I Our Priests in Holy Pilgrimage, Quite through the Land have gone, Surveying each Religious House Of Abbot, Fry'r, and Nun The yearly Rent, And full Extent Of every one they know; And in whose hands Are all our Lands, As ancient Writers show. II Those Places all shall be restor'd, As in short time you'll hear, I know the Man has pass'd his word, Of which you need not fear: He did ne'er evade One Promise made, Nor fail'd a Friend in Woe; But when 'twill be, Nor I, nor he, Nor the Devil himself does know. III Religious Men shall hither haste, Their Zeal shall make them run; The Jesuits shall your Wives keep Chaste, Each Fry'r Confess his Nun: The Men shall Shrive, The Women— So all shall be forgiven; Your Daughters Whore, Then quit their Score, And make them fit for Heaven. IV For Lady Abbess shall appear An old Flux'd Bawd or Punk, Has done both ways these threescore years, Talk'd Bawdy, and been Drunk; Religious Puns To teach the Nuns Committed to her Charge; And mortifie Their L? As Nature does enlarge. V The Vestals all shall Virgins be That never went astray, Have been train'd up Religiously The clean contrary way: In Julian's Song For Whoring long, Tho oft they've noted been; Nature of Force Will have its Course, 'Twas all but Venial Sin. VI Your Colledges shall be our own, As vacancy does fall; We'll strip each Doctor of his Gown, The Parsons turn out all: Their Revenues great, With pleasant Seat, The Church to us has given, To sing you Mass, Confess each Ass, And make you fit for Heaven. VII Nor will we any longer wait, After such notice given; Nor shall they in the Pulpits prate, Or teach the way to Heaven: 'Tis our Province, You to convince; Our Arguments shall be, Without Dispute To make you mute, Then, Hey Boys, up go we. VIII Now, Hereticks, consider well The Game you have to play; You yet may keep on this side Hell, If warn'd by what we say: But e'er your Lands Shall 'scape our hands, Which have been long our due; We'll Stab, we'll Shoot, And Damn to boot, Then, Hey Boys, up go you. A New Song on the Prince and Princess of Orange. I Since Orange is on British Land, That Protestant who will not stand To him, and under his Command, Befriends the Romish Cause, Gives all our Liberties away, Our Lives to Popish Priests a prey, And Magna Charta does betray The Test and Penal Laws. II Bid too Illustrious Moll appear, We sha'n't have them more cause to fear, From any Jesuit practice here, The Lawful Heir to cheat. Then to her Highness a full Glass, The Second Faith-defending Lass, And to her Good Man: but the Mass Let Providence defeat. Tyrconnel's distracted Readings upon his Irish Forces in England. In Allusion to Mr. Cowley's Pindarick Ode upon destiny. Hoc quoque fatale est sic ipsum expendere fatum. Manil. I. Strange and Unnatural. It's as Strange that England should want Ireland, as it is Unnatural for her War-like Spirits to brook their Infantry's Assistance. Strange and unnatural, let's stay and see This Pageant of a Prodigy. Themselves. By their Barbarous, Thievish, and Rapatious Behaviors, where ever they Marched, one would think, they had no Officer to Command them.Lo, of themselves, Dear Joyes, like Chess-men move, Lo, the unbred, ill-contriv'd Machins prove As full of Craft and Cruelty, Of Baseness and of Butchery, As we our self, who fear'd they wa'n't so fierce as we. Here a proud Pawn in Irish shape l'admire, That still designing higher, A Dear Joy twice Whipt in Covent-Garden, for saying he hoped to see the Streets run with Heretical Blood on St. Clement's Day at Night, when, it seems, the Massacre was designed to be.(Till the Fool lost his Lot By blabbing out their Plot, Foretelling the design'd St. Clements flood He hoped to see run with Heretick Blood. Viz. For discovering the Plot; not for the Words speaking, as the gulled Protestants were made to believe.For which twice Whipt, that done, And's Gauntlet Race begun) At the Goal end became Another Thing and Name, Viz. The Irish Gentleman Souldier by Father Whip and Gauntlet, was immediately Transubstantiated into a Casheired Scoundrel Rogue.Another Thing and Name: An Irish Spark, whose behaviour in his sundry Quarters from Chester to London and Portsmouth proclaim him.Here I'm amaz'd at the actions of a Knight, That does bold Plunders in no Fight; Whose Landlords swear he has lost his Senses quite, For he can't hear their Wrongs, nor see to do them Right. Usurping Rooks, i. e. The Irish Priests, not content with their own natural Motions, but endeavoured to leap over the Bishops Heads, to make Vacancies for their own Perswasion.Here I, (woe's me) Usurping Rooks do blame, For those false Moves, that thus has broke our Game; That to their Grave the Bag, those Conquer'd Machines bring, But above all, th'ill Conduct of the Mated King. II. What e'er these seem, what e'er Philosophy And Sense and Reason tell, said I, These Tools have Life, Election, Liberty, 'Tis their own Native Wisdom Molds their State; Their Wit and Folly make their Fate, They do, they do, said I, but strait, Lo, from my enlightned Eyes, the Mists and Shadows fell, Which hinder Spirits from being Visible; Locusts. It was the Opinion of that Reverend Divine Mr. Joseph Mead, and that Immortal Philosopher Dr. Henry Moor, that the Jesuits are meant by the Locusts from the Bottomless Pit, in the 9th Chapter of the Revelations.And then appear'd the Locusts come from Hell; When Lo, I see the Jesuits play'd the Mate. With them, alas! no otherwise it proves; An unseen Hand makes all their Moves; And some are Great, and some are Small, Some climb from good, some from good Fortune fall; Those senceless Teagues, and these Dear Joys we call Figures, alas, of Speech, for Pop'ry plays us all. III. Me from the Womb, Midwife Pope Joan did take; She cut my Navel, Wash'd me, and my Head With her own Hands she Fashoned; She did a Covenant with me make, And Circumciz'd my tender Soul, and thus she spake: Thou Bigot of my Roman Church shall be; Hate and Renounce (said she) Sense, Reason, Laws and Test, Justice and Truth for me. So shalt thou great at Court be, but in War When Jepson, Wareing, and Tomson, were Executed at the Gallows at Dublin for Blood's Plot against the late Duke of Ormond, in the year 1663. some people cryed out a Rescue, a Rescue, which was suspected; at which 10000 of the gentle Spectators at least, run away from the Gallows, amongst which this Famous Warrior by the name of Colonel T?bot, spurred on to the Gates of the City, which finding shut against him, Couragiously ventured his Life to save it, by Swiming over the Liffie.Thy flight from Dublin Gallows will thee bar. Boast thou of thy great fertile Praise, Thy design'd Massacre will raise, Although thou liv'st not to enjoy the Bays. She spoke, and all my years to come Bewitch'd took their unlucky Doom. Their several ways of Life let others chuse; Their several Pleasures let them use: But I was Born for Hate and to Abuse. IV. With Fate what boots it to contend? Such I begun, such am, and so must end; The Star that did my Being frame, Was but a Lambent Flame. And some small Light it did dispence, But neither Wit nor Sense, Nor Heat, nor Influence. No matter Talbot, let the Blind Goddess see How Grateful thou can'st be, For all her Elegible Gifts conferr'd on thee, (Specifick Essences of Popery) As Folly, Lust and Flattery, Fraud, Extortion, Calumny, Murther, Self-will and Infidelity, Cowardise and Hypocricy. Do thou Rejoyce, not Blush to be, As all th'Inspir'd Disingenuous Men, Charles Martell, Son of the Whore Alpayde, (by Pipin the French King) the Great Church Robber, and first violater of Tythes in the Christian World, and Will. Pen the Second: For which Martell was Damn'd, or the Legend Lies: For Eucherie Bishop of Orleance, in a Vision, saw him in Hell Torments: And that Eucherie might believe what he saw, an Angel instructed him to seek for Martell in his Sepulchre, which he did, but found him not, but the Place all black, and instead of Martell a direful Serpent, as you have it in the Annals of Orleance.And all thy Damn'd Fore-Fathers were, from Martell down to Pen. A New Litany for the Holy Time of LENT. I From all the Women We have whor'd From being bound to keep Our Word, From Civil Broils and Foreign Sword, Libera nos Domine. II From store of Ships and want of Men, From leaping into the Lyons Den, From a Dutch-War, and Burnet's Pen, Libera nos, &amp;c.

I Two O Toms and Nat, In Council sat, To rigg out a Thansgiving, And make a Prayer, For a thing in the Air, That's neither Dead nor Living. II The Dame of East As 'tis Express'd, In her late quaint Epistle, Did to our Lady, Bequeath the Baby, With Coral, Bells and Whistle. III With this intent, she to her sent Her Gold and Diamond Bodkin, That to conceive, She might have leave; And is not this an odd thing? IV Then a Pot of Ale, To the Prince of Wales, Tho some are of Opinion, That when 'tis come out, A Double Clout Will cover his Dominion. The Audience. The attribution of this poem is questionable. The Criticks that pretend to Sense, Do cavil at the Audience, As if his Grace were not as good, To bow to, as a piece of Wood. Did not our Fathers heretofore Their sensless Deities adore? Did not Old Delphos all along Vent Oracles without a Tongue? And wisest Monarchs did imporune From the dumb God to know their Fortune. Did not the Speaking-Head of late, Of matters Learnedly Debate? And rendred without Tongue or Ears Wise answers to his whisp'ring Peers? And shall we to a living Prince Deny the State of Audience? What tho the Bantling cannot speak? Yet like the Blockhead he may squeak; Give Audience by Interpreter, The wisest Prince can do no more. Then enter with a Princes Banner Sir Charles, after the usual manner. Great Sir, His Holiness from Rome Greets your high Birth. The Prince cry'd Mum. The Consecrated Pilch and Clout, If you'll vouchsafe to hear me out, And many other Toys I'm come To lay them to your sacred Bum. So young, yet such a Godlike Ray! Phœbus, your Dad, was Priest D?a, Great Prince, I have no more to say. Conducted next their comes, Great Sir, An Envoy from the Emperor, To Gratulate your lucky Fate, That gives to Englands Throne new date; We joy that any thing should Reign, To baffle Orange and the Dane. The Youth, to see them thus beguil'd, In token of his favour, smil'd. But at the Spaniard laugh'd outright. As shamm'd again in Eighty Eight. Next, having pass'd the inward Centry, The doubtful Monsieur made his entry. The King, my Master, Sir, has sent Your Royal Birth to complement; If you will make it but appear, That you are Englands Lawful Heir. Here Lady P?is took him short, Have you a King? Thank Maz'rine for't! Fr. man Whoe're the Father was, the Mother Was France's Q. (P?is) Who questions t'other? At this Reproof he pawn'd a Purse, And parting made his peace with Nurse. The Dane, the Suede, with other Nations, Come in with loud Congratulations. Upon the Suede so fam'd for Battel, He cast a frown, and shook his Rattle. And for the Dane, who took the part Of good Prince George, he let a fart. This put him in a sullen fit, Nurse scarce could dance him out of it. VVhen an Embassador from Poland, Knock'd at the Door, and Velt from Holland, He crying suck'd, and sucking cry'd, VVhen Lady Governess reply'd, Peace, Prince, peace, Prince, peace, pretty Prince And let the States have Audience. Dutch-man.]From Holland I am hither sent, To Challenge, not to Complement. Prepare with speed your Twenty Sail, Your twice four thousand on the Nail; Which by your Senate was enacted, With Orange, when your Sire contracted. The Name of Holland did affright, And make th'young Hero scream outright. But, Orange nam'd, the Royal Elf, The sweet, sweet Babe, beshit himself. Tyrconnel, who came o're no less Than to be made his Governess , To take her leave, by luck came in, She suck'd his Nose, and lick'd him clean. Last came the Lady H? from Play, Mov'd by Instinct he cry'd, Mamma, And posted to the Queen away. The States-Man's Almanack: Being an Excellent New Ballad, in which the Qualities of each Month are consider'd; whereby it appears, that a Parliament cannot meet in any of the Old Months: With a Proposal for mending the Kalender, humbly offered to the Packers of the next Parliament. To the Tune of, Cold and Raw, &amp;c. PROLOGUE. [I] The talk up and down, In Country and Town, Has been long of Parliaments sitting, But we'll make it clear, Ne'r a month in the Year, Is proper for such a Meeting. II The Judges declare it, The Ministers swear it, And the Town as a Tale receives it: Let them say what they can, There's never a Man, Except God's Vicegerent, believes it. III If the Criticks in spight, Our Arguments slight, And think 'em too light for the Master: It has often been known, That Men on a Throne, Have Hrarang'd the whole Realm with no better. IV For in times of Old, When Kings were less bold And made for their faults Excuses: Such Topicks as these, The Commons to please, Did serve for most Excellent Uses. V Either Christmas came on, Or Harvest begun, And all must repair to their Station: 'Twas too Dry, or too Wet, For the Houses to Sit, And Hey for a Prorogation. VI Then, Sir, if you please, With such Reasons as these, Let's see how each Moon is appointed: For tho it be strange, In all her Change, She Favours not God's Anointed. The ALMANACK. January. The first is too cold, For Popery to hold, Since Southern Climats Improve it: And therefore in Frost, 'Tis Odds but it's lost, If they offer to remove it. February. The next do's betide, (Tho then the King dy'd) Ill luck, and they must not be tampring: For had not Providence quick, Cool'd his Head i'th' Nick, 'Fore God they were all a scampring. March. The Month of Old Rome, Has an Omen with some, But the sleeping Wind then Rouzes, And trust not the crowd, When Storms are so loud, Lest their Breath infect the Houses. April. In this by Mishap, Southask had a Clap, Which pepper'd our Gracious Master: And therefore i'th' Spring, He must Physick his Thing, And venture no new Disaster. May. This Month is too good, And too lusty his Blood, To be for Business at leisure, With his Confessors leave, Honest Bridget may give, The Fumbler Royal his Pleasure. June. The Brains of the State, Have been too hot of late, They have manag'd all Business in rapture: And to call us in June, Is much to the same Tune, Being mad to the end of the Chapter. July. This Season was made For Camp and Parade, Where with the Expence of his Treasures; Of much Sweat and Pains, Discreetly he Trains, Such Men, as will break all his Measures. August. This Month did advance Our Projects in France, As Bartholomew Remembers; But alas they want force, To take the same Course, With our Heretical Members. September. They cannot now meet, For the Progress was set, But they find it a scurvy Fashion: To ride, and to ride, To be snubb'd and deny'd, By every good man in the Nation. October. Now Hunting comes in, That License for Sin, That do's with a Cloak befriend him, For if the Queen knows, What at G?'s he do's, His Divine Right can hardly defend him. November. November might do, For ought that we know: But that the King promis'd by chance Sirs, And his Word before, Was pawn'd for much more, Than e're 'twill be able to Answer. December. The last of the year, Resemblance does bear, To their hopes and fortune declining: Ne'r hope for success, Day grows less and less, And the Sun once so high has done shining. EPILOGUE. [I] You Gypsies of Rome, That run up and down, And with Miracles People Cozen: By the help of some Saint, Get the Month that you want, And make Thirteen of the Dozen. II You see the Old year, Wont help ye, 'tis clear, And therefore to save your Honour: Get a new Sun and Monn, And the Work is half done, And Faith I think not sooner The State-Holder: Or, the Prince's Almanack, Calculated for the Meridian of London, and Calling of a Protestant Parliament; being a Counterpart of the States-Man's Almanack. PROLOGUE. I The Talk about went, That a Free Parliament, Should never more Sit in this Nation: But I'll make it clear, There's no Month in the year, But is proper on this occasion. II Tho some did deceive us, You may now believe us, Since the Royal Assent made his Exit: Say what e'er you can, There's never a man, cepting Lord Wem that suspects it. III If the Graves of the Laws, Our Topicks oppose, We'll prove 'tis the Sense of the Nation; The readiest way, To make the Slaves pay, For their Nibbling with Dispensation. IV In times on Record, When Kings kept their Word, And people were in their Senses: So poor an Excuse, Was such an Abuse, No Monarch e'er made such Pret eces, V The King is withdrawn, The Prince come to Town, The timely Redeemer o'th' Nation: The Lords are all Set, And the old Members met, Then hey! for a Convocation. VI For tho to our loss, Things ever went cross, Whilst Petre was chief Director: There is not a Sun, Or a Change in the Moon, But favours our Great Protector. The ALMANACK. January. Tho the First be too cold, For Popery to hold, Yet fear not a Dissolution: For tho it be Frost, And the Jesuists Crost, It agrees with a Dutch Constitution. February. Though next came a thing, Brought Popery in, With all the fine Relicks and Crosses: Tho then the King dy'd, We have One on our side, This Month will repair all our Losses. March. The Month of Old Rome, Will bring 'em all home, The Authors of all our Evil; This Month the Wind blows, And the Breath of the House Will send 'em all going to the Devil. April. In this the Old Whore Of Babel came o're, Which was a sore Clap to the Nation; And therefore i'th' Spring, We must manage the thing, To make a full Reformation. May. The Prince is too good, And too near to the Blood, To allow to the House any leisure; The Lords and High Powers, Must gather new Flowers, To stock the Exhausted Treasure. June. This Month brought in Grist, To the Hot-headed Priest, Who over-rul'd the Ruler, And therefore the House, By way of a Doze, Must Sit to prepare 'em a Cooler. July. This Month of late made, For Camp and Parade, In which were exhausted our Treasures, Will better be spent By a wise Parliament, Enacting and making new Measures. August. This finished a League, With Monsieur and Teague, For a total Extirpation Of the Hereticks Cause: And therefore the House Must sit to Establish the Nation. September. The Colleges fool'd, This month over-rul'd, And therefore each Protestant Member, Must sit and Debate, Of matters of State, To set all things right in September. October. This Season was spent, By Burton and Brent, To manage each Corporation; And therefore 'tis fit, The Houses should sit, To Vote it a Combination: November. Above all the rest, Will be in request, The Auspicious Month of November; When Orange our Cause, Restored with the Laws, Recorded by every Member. December. Tho this be the last, And all danger past, Yet are we resolv'd every Member, Both Common and Peer, To sit all the Year, From January to December. EPILOGUE. I You Gypsies of Rome, That hence are withdrawn, In the Name of the State, we beseech you, To the dozen before, Find out a Month more, And we'll sit out that month to oblige you. II You see ne're a close Does favour your Cause, Since England's so well protected: When there's no more Moon, You may sit on this Throne; For sooner you cannot expect it. The ORANGE. I Good People I pray, Throw the Orange away, 'Tis a very sowre Fruit, and was first brought in play, When good Judith Wilk, In her Pocket brought Milk, And with Cushins and Warming-pans labour'd to bilk This same Orange. II When the Army retreats, And the Parliament sits, To Vote our K? the true use of his Wits: Twill be a sad means, VVhen all he obtains, Is to have his Calves-head dress'd with other mens Brains And an Orange, III The sins of his Youth, Made him think of one Truth, VVhen he spawl'd from his Lungs, and bled twice at the mouth, That your fresh sort of food, Does his Carkass more good, And the damn'd thing that Cur'd his putrify'd blood Was an Orange. IV This hopeful young Son, Is surely his own, Because from an O? it cry'd to be gone; But the Hereticks say, He was got by D? For neither K? nor the Nuncio dare stay Near an Orange. V Since Lewis was Cut, From his Breech to the Gut, France fancies an Open-arse delicate Fruit, We wiser than so, Have two strings to our Bow, For we've a good ? that's an Open-arse too, And an Orange. VI Till Nanny writ much, To the Rebels the D? Her Mother, good Woman, ne'r ow'd her a grutch, And the box of the Ear, Made the matter appear, That the only foul savour the Q? could not bear Was an Orange. VII An honest Old Peer, That forsook God last year, Pull'd off all his Plaisters, and Arm'd for the War; But his Arms would not do, And his Aches throbb'd too, That he wish'd his own Pox and his M???s too On an Orange. VIII Old Tyburn must groan, For Jeffreys is known To have Perjur'd his Conscience to marry his Son; And D?s Cause Will be try'd by Just Laws, And H?t must taste a most damnable Sauce, With an Orange. IX Lob, Pen, and a score Of those honest men more, VVill find this same Orange exceedingly sowre; The Q? to be seiz'd, VVill be very ill pleas'd, And so will K. P?, too dry to be squeez'd By an Orange An Epistle to Mr. Dryden. Dryden, thy VVit has catterwaul'd too long, Now Lero, Lero, is the only Song. VVhat Singing, Dancing, Interludes of late, Stuff, and set off our goodly Farce of State? Not Albevil can turn a deep Intrigue, Till first well warm'd with Bishop Talgol's Jigg. W?m cannot sleep, or if a Nap he takes, His Dream some Old Tressilian Ballad breaks. But was e'er seen the like, in Prose or Metre, To this mad Play, or work of Father Petre? At Court no longer Punchionello takes, Each Scene, Part, Cue, mishapen to the Mac's. Such Plot, and the Catastrophe is such, We must be either Irish all, or Dutch. Our very Judges in Westminster-Hall, Like their Old Roof, were Irish Timber all. And (bless us!) Irish Wolves are brought to keep The Nation, grown now all such silly Sheep; Such errant Asses, errant Cattle made, Or to be yok'd, or saddl'd, fleec'd, or flead. O Martyrs Son! thy destiny is shown, Such props are for a Scaffold, not a Throne: So Juno, in her impotence of rage, By Heaven deny'd, did Hell's black Powers engage; Yet sped the Heroe: Jove and Fate were strong; Religious care: He took his Gods along: But hark, O hark, the Belgick Lion roars, And shakes afar the French and British Shoars: One Brandy drinks, one mad with Prophecies: Lord! what they tell us of some Prince from Frize; Arms, and the Man they sing, no French finess, But hearty blows, and Brandenburg Address. Hence Vigour, and our Figure comes agen, We rise, and walk, all true erected men. The force of those Circæan Cups subdu'd, And the wild Charms our new Armida brew'd, The Witchcraft he (our true Rinaldo) broke, And grubs the base pretenders to his stock. But oh, what Spirit of deceit afar, Possess'd our Pulpits, and bewitch'd the Bar? What Bane, what Mischief on poor Mortals shed By Vermin, from the Laws corruption bred? Tho to their Irish Roof no Cobwebs cleave, Below what strife and endless toyls they weave: Wanting brave strength to strangle men to death, What Frauds they hide! What Venom underneath! And when some shorter course to Murder's shown, Cry, O that (luscious) Point! they gain'd the Crown. Sons of the Pulpit the same measures keep, And of that same stumm'd Cup have drunk as deep. Agog for some odd transubstantiate thing, Chimera Reign, or Metaphysick King, Sublim'd to School Divinity extreams, Their Brains would crow with Patriarchal Dreams. So high from solid honest wisdom blown, They'd have some Hippo-Centaur on the Throne. Not Law-ordain'd, but by some God appointed, Not Lay-elected, but be Priest-anointed. Away this Goblin Witchcraft, Priestcraft-Prince; Give us a King, Divine, by Law and Sense. Now Bar and Pulpit to Dragoons a sport, Their Cause is carried to the last Effort. Princes in more compendious method teach, Force is their way; let Old Apostles Preach. What's stablish'd Law, where standing Armies come, Or who'll talk Gospel to a Kettle-Drum? When God would hear, where Giants did oppress, The several Nations had their Hercules. So were the Horns of grizly violence broke, So people freed from triple Geryon's yoke. The various Snake in Lerna-Lough that bred, That loll'd and hiss'd to Death, at every head, Nemæan Lion, Erymanthian Boar, In Bogs that wallow, and on Hills that roar: All by his Godlike Prowess done away, Their Lawless Rule, and that Gigantick sway. In vain whilst this high Virtue Nations sought, The Nassau-House were never yet without. Nor is confin'd to Provinces their care, Their generous labour neighbouring Kingdoms share. Here the foul Herd flee from his lifted hand, That long had made a Stable of the Land. The Monster of the Lough, new Lerna-Plague (But scarce in head) the Bog-begotten Teagne, The ravenous kind, the Harpies sharp for prey, With Birds obscene, and uncouth to the day. No Den, no Ditch, no rousting for them more, Now, now is come our Hercules ashore. Vile Fraud dispell'd, and superstitious Mists: He from our Temple drives all Knaves and Priests. Then warmer W?op, in due Scarlet shown, To Coffee-Dick bequeaths his rusty Gown. Oh Dryden, if this Hercules were thine, How wou'd his Club, and Atlas-shoulders shine: How wou'dst thou all our Maids of Honour fright, With naughty Tale, of Fifty in a Night? Howe'er, no more let Xavier mar thy Pen, No Miracle to forty thousand men. When Law, and bald Divinity begins, Why then, the marvel that a Poet fins? A Sale of Old State Houshold-Stuff. To the Tune of, Old Simon the King. I The Government being resolv'd To new furnish the House of State, Hath thought fitting to put off the old, That was rusty and worn out of date. Then come all you State-Brokers away, And take off our old fashion'd trinkoms, You for a small matter may buy What cost the price of three Kingdoms. Quoth J? the Bigotted K? Quoth J? the Politick thing, With a thred-bare Oath, And a Catholick Troth, That never was worth a farthing. II Here's (what was to cleanse Church and State) The Beesom of Reformation, Brought in by Henry the Eighth, And Besses grave Convocation. Here are diverse Conformity Acts, The Penal Laws and all, With a parcel of over-rul'd Statutes, Kick'd out of Westminster-Hall. Quoth J?, &amp;c. III Come buy the old Tapistry Hangings, Which hung in the House of Lords, That kept the Spanish Invasion, And Powder-plot, on Record. A musty old Magna Charta, That wants new scowring and cleansing, Writ so long since, and so dark too, That 'tis hard to pick out the meaning. Quoth J?, &amp;c. IV Here's a Pack of nasty Court Cards, Much foul'd with over playing, Condemn'd to the Fields of Tom T?d, For they never were worth the buying. A pitiful tatter'd Scotch League, Swallow'd meerly to trepan men, Took by the late King in Intrigue, And aftewards burnt by the Hangman. Quoth J?, &amp;c. V Three Protestant Vizors much worn, And in use since the days of Queen Bess, Which now we have laid by with scorn, Being resolv'd to appear with bare face. Come buy a thing brought from Breda, Call'd a Royal Declaration, Which of late we have copied at large, Having promis'd to keep up the fashion Of old Simon the King, Quoth J?, &amp;c. VI A parcel of Conge d' esliers, By Heretick Bishops own'd, The reward of the old Cavaliers, For their Loyalty to the Crown. Here's your Corporation Charters, And University Regulations, For all which as cheap you may barter, As Cucumbers in the Vacation. Quoth J?, &amp;c. VII Here's a Crew of Exclusion Abhorrers, And a litter of Loyal Addressors, Who'd have run to the Devil for us, When they Bully'd for Popish Successors. But now they are down in the mouth, Their Damning and Healthing forsakes 'em, If you think them not a penny-worth For fetching, the Devil may take them. Quoth J?, &amp;c. VIII Here's a Tribe of mad Pulpiteers, That still for Right Line were trimming, We'll exchange them for Bandileers, And leave them to Urim and Thummim. Here's a Cart Load of Observators, That were writ in Defence of the Church, By Hodge that Eternal Prater, Whose Quill is now left in the lurch. Quoth J?, &amp;c. IX Will you buy any Protestant Places, In Army, or where you think best Sir? Those that think to keep them are Asses, VVhen once we are rid of the Test Sir. And thus I will end my Sale, With a Bar to either House, If we get but over it well, For the rest I care not a Lowse. Quoth J?, &amp;c. The DREAM. Weary'd with Business, and with Cares opprest, My faculties were Doz'd and fond of rest, An unusual heaviness did on me creep, My Soul Indulg'd it; yet I could not sleep. Dreams short and frightful vext me all the Night, I found I was betray'd, and long'd for Light; The first such Wonders brought within my view, And when I wak'd I almost thought them true. Methought I saw great Julius sadly lye Bleeding from all his Wounds, and Brutus by. The ungrateful Brutus which he doted on, With Meager Cassius pleas'd with what he had done, Crying, the World and Brutus are my own. I nearer drew to view the Ghastly Trunk, But oh! the Scene was chang'd, Cæsar was sunk; 'Twas Charles the Second, which lay mangl'd there, The Sacrificing Tribe too did appear, Brutus and Cassius, Y?k and Petre were. Charles weeping, grasp'd his Brother by the hand, I heard him sighing say, within my Land A faithful Pious Mother thou wilt command, Who in the utmost of Extremity, When all but her and much upbraided, I Wou'd from the Crown have quite excluded thee, Preach'd up thy forfeit Title by our Laws, And in thy banishment maintain thy Cause; Passive Obedience thou hast much in store, But do not urge it to thy utmost power: James to preserve her most devoutly swore, Charles dy'd, and James discharg'd his Oath next hour, I saw the Priests flock in: the Bishops out, Saw Petres cram the VVafer down his Throat, Tho' dead, it sav'd the Heretick no doubt. I saw him poorly bury'd in the Night, A wretched Train, and a more wretched sight; To me it seem'd a Funeral in Disguise, For fear his Creditors shou'd his body seize. I saw him shewn for two pence in a Chest, Like Monk, Old Harry, Mary, and the rest, And if the figure answer'd its intent, In ten years time 'twould buy a Monument. My fancy brought me back again to Court, Where only Fools Advise, and Knaves Resort, Our Kingdoms Curse, and other Nations Sport. I heard the Jesuits in a grand Cabal, Resolve to Root out Heresie or fall, Each his particular Opinion gave, They cry'd an opportunity we have To fetter her, who kept us long her Slave. Immediately they pitch'd upon a Rule, How to suppress it by a forward Fool, A bawling blund'ring senseless Tool; VVhose Mouthing at White-Chappel first began, VVho regularly to his Greatness ran Thro' all the vile degrees of Treachery, And now Usurps the Court of Equity? He said, if you wou'd bring the Clergy down, Erect a Court-Commission from the Crown, And for Dispencing Law let me alone, They hugg'd their Bubble, and the deed was done. Petre grew Fat, and with Mandamus's, Canker'd the VVorthy Universities. The seats of Learning Black-Heads might command, Yet the Kings promise to the Church doth stand. Next, Liberty of Conscience was Ordain'd; The Bishops for Contempt were then Arraign'd; The Nobles and the Commons Closetted, The Penal Laws must be Abolished: If you refuse, your Principles are base, Disloyal, and you lose our Royal Grace, And each that has Dependencies his place. Rochester fell, the Loyal Herbert starv'd, Each that forsook his God, his Monarch serv'd: Somerset lost his Troops, and Shrowsbury, Oxford was stripp'd to Scarsdal Lumbley; And many more too tedious to relate, By whom in safety, James, thou now dost sit. VVhen thou perceiv'dst no comfort from this Wild, Thy Dame, immediately was quick with Child, The Princess at the Bath when it was Born, The Bishops in the Tower, yet had he sworn The Church of England never should be wrong'd, Upon this News the Hot-brain'd Papists Throng'd; I wak'd, and as I on my Dream Reflected, My reasonable Notions thus projected: O King, I cry'd, thy Measures run too fast, And thou wilt find the curse of it at last; Why dost thou wrong thy Country, shame thy life, To please false Priests, and an ungrateful Wife. A VVife, whose Character has always been A Fawning Dutchess, and a Sawcy Queen. How canst thou suffer Petre's Insolence, VVho only makes a harvest of his Prince. A Slave, to Rule Three Kingdoms, Govern thee, Yet ne'er was Master of a Family: This Serpent envying thy Happiness, Has crept into thy Eve, whose wilfulness Has certainly betray'd thy Paradise; Discerning Hallifax thy fall foresaw, And early did his slghted Faith withdraw; He needs no pardon for the advice he gave, VVhich shews him honester than some that have. Under the Rose Men use their mind to tell, But now Myne-Heir 'tis under the Broad Seal; O Nassaw, with thy promis'd Succours come, And be to us like Anthony to Rome: Thy Wife shall young Octavia's place supply, And those that have betray'd our Country fly, Unless the King to prove the Prince his own, Shall to the Lyons-Den present his Son, And if the Royal Brute do not destroy, The Infant, by Christ 'tis his none Joy. The Paradox on the Confinement of the Lords. Let Cynicks bark, and the stern Stagyrite At Epicures Precepts vent his spite; Let Church-men Preach their Thred-bare Paradox, Passive Obedience to their bleeding Flocks. Let Stoicks boast of a contented mind, The unknown pleasures of a Life confin'd; That in Imprisonment the Soul is free, Grant me (ye Gods) but Ease and Liberty. That there is Pleasure in a dirty Road, A tir'd Horse that sinks beneath his Load, No money, and an old inveterate Pox; This I'll believe without a Paradox. But to affirm 'twas the Dispencing Power, That did Decree the Prelates to the Tower; And such Confinements for the Propagation Of the true Doctrine of the Reformation. That to remove the Candlesticks from sight Is to enlarge the Gospel and the Light; And the Seven Angels are in Tribulation. To Guard the Church from Pagan Invocation. To say this is the keeping of our VVord, The only way we have to be secur'd; Supporting of the English Church and Cause, In all its Priviledges, Rights and Laws. Pardon my Faith, for sooner I'll believe The Subtile Serpent was deceiv'd by Eve; Rome shall with Hereticks her promise keep, And Ravenous VVolves Protect the straggling Sheep, That P? shall be mild and moderate, Not out of meer regard to his Estate; And for a Hopeful Heir Invoke the Saints, Out of his tender love to Protestants. That Father Petres Counsel shall prevail, To quit their guiltless Lordships without Fail; And Gildford beg i'th' name of the Young Prince, Dispencing James may with their minds dispence. I will believe D? shall Fail His Grace, And C? shall with C? change place; And H? when made a Cardinal, Shall Write a Learn'd Apology for all. That for Old Ely, Bristol, Bath and Wells, The Jesuits would pawn their Beads and Bells; For Lloyd and Peterborough to be Bail, Good Rochester would lye himself in Goal. That the Lord Chancellor shall quit the Purse, For their respective Fines to Reimburse; Or that the Judges should not all Conspire To find them guilty of a Preminire. That Pemberton shall at the Bench prevail, And Allibone shall Plead to be their Bail; Or H?, that lyes upon the Lurch; Who left the Charter shall restore the Church. That she, who lately lookt into her Choice, The Witty Author of the Brace of Mice, Shall baffle the Old Panther in her Race, And Crown her Husband with the Lawrels Bays. All this I freely could believe and more, But that the Lords are Sail'd out of the Tower, Out of Respect to be sent back again, For breach of Laws they sworn are to maintain. That they have guilt of Disobedience, In this you must excuse my Diffidence, Who plac'd upon the Monarchs Head the Crown, Props of the Church, and Pillars of the Throne. Over the Lord D???rs Door. Unhappier Age who e'er saw, When Truth doth go for Treason; Every Blockead's Will for Law, And Coxcombs Sense for Reason. Religion's made a Bawd of State, To serve the Pimps and Panders, Our Liberty a Prison Gate, And Irishmen Commanders. O Wretched is our Fate! What Dangers do we run, We must be Wicked to be Great, And to be Just, undone. 'Tis thus our Sov'raign keeps his Word, And makes the Nation Great; To Irishmen he trusts the Sword, To Jesuits the State. Over the Lord S?s Door. If Cevil the Wise, From his Grave should arise, And look the fat, B? in the Face. He'd take him from Mass, And turn him to Grass, And swear he was none of Race. To the Speaking-Head. I'm come my future Fate to seek, Speak then, Cœlestial Block-head speak. Answer. Had'st thou not consulted with the Witch at Rome, Thou need'st not thus, like Saul, to Endor come To seek out (Brother Solid-head) thy Doom The Hearts of all thy Friends are lost and gone; Gazing they stand, and grieving round thy Throne. And scarce believe thou art the Martyrs Son. Those, whom thou favourest, merit not thy Grace, They, to their Interest, Sacrifice thy Peace, And will in sorrow make thee end thy days. Tempt not thy Fate too far, do not rely On force or fraud; Why should'st thou Monarch, why, Live unbelov'd, and unlamented dye? The Ghost. A Papist dy'd, as 'twas Jehovah's Will, And his poor Soul went trudging down to Hell! Where, when he did arrive, just at the Entry, He found a Mastive Devil standing Centry, With flaming Eyes, and Face as black as Soot, A Musqueteer with a great Cloven Foot: And who goes there? I, a poor Papist Ghost, That's come to dwell upon the Stygian Coast. Stay where you are, and do not press so hard, For I must call the Captain of the Guard; He gave me Orders to let none come in, But only such as should have leave from him. The Captain call'd, accordingly came forth, A Devil, of Integrity and Worth; VVho all in Noblest Scarlet being dress'd, VVith a most delicate fine Embroider'd Vest, He asks the Ghost with a great Voice, as loud As mighty Thunder, breaking from a Cloud, VVhat was the bus'ness? Sir, I am come to dwell, If you will please to give me leave, in Hell. Damn you, you whorson Dog, said he to him, I love my Master, and you shan't come in; For if above you eat your God, I fear, Should you come in, youl'd eat the Devil here. A Dialogue between a Loyal Addressor, and a Blunt Whiggish Clown. Ungrateful VVreth! Can'st thou pretend a Cause' To fear the loss of Liberty and Laws? Has not the King been at a vast Expence, To raise the Gallant Troops in thy Defence? Did he not promise in a Proclamation, To rule by Law at's Coronation? Clown. But has he not already dam'd the Test? And sure that Princes VVord is but a jest, VVho Rules an Army, and Obeys a Priest: Nor can his Solemn Oath make us much safer; His Sword is Steel, his God is but a VVafer. A new Song of the misfortunes of an Old Whore and her Brats. I Tho' the Old Hag of Rome, Has bewitch'd us all Dumb, She can Tongue-tye our Muses no longer; We now spue out her Charms, And sing the brave Arms Of Great Orange and Scomberg, ding-dong Sir. II If we open'd our Lips, Wooden Peep holes and Whips Was of late the mild Pennance enjoyn'd us; Now Truth's no more Treason, We esteem it a season To be merry, and so you shall find us. III Life and Fortune Addresses, Shall not wear out our Presses, To flatter and sooth a Just Nero; But loud Declarations, To secure the three Nations Nrom the French, and from Lilli-burlero. IV See how each Popish Gull, Does look silly and dull, O hone! O hone! all are Lamenting, They've no Catholick Banter, No wise Hind and Panther. Nor any thing else worth the Printing. V While we Hereticks do write, Ay, and Print too in spite Of the Devil, to revenge our late wrongs Sir; And the Hawkers hoarse Lungs, With our Lampoons and Songs, Make the Streets eccho all the day long Sir: VI Now brave Orange advances, What the fam'd League with France is, We shall know to poor Catholicks sorrow, Stricken with Pannick Fears, How the Whelps hang their Ears, Pack up Relicks, and bid us good Morrow! VII Father Petre, and others Of his Politick Brothers, Who one would think should have disdain'd it Are on fire to be gone, Tho they might every one, If they'd stay here a little, be Sainted. VIII Just like old Rats and Mice, These bold Vermine are Wise, VVhen they find a House ready to tumble, Away strait they advance, Bound for Flanders or France, Adieu, Votre Serviteur humble. IX But pray what shall become, O'th' young Kitlings of Rome, I mean those the Old Whore has Converted; When they're grip'd by the Claws, Of reviv'd Penal Laws, And by all Ghostly Fathers deserted. X 'Tis hard to leave the poor Elves, Thus to shift for themselves, For unless you'd confirm'd the Babes better-a, With your Cowardise tainted, They'll e'ne grudge to be Sainted With St. Coleman, St. Whitebread, &amp;c. XI So when Witches are taken For enchanting Folks Bacon, Cows, Horses, or any such thing Sir; And the Hang-man once takes 'em, Their Imps all forsake them, And bequeath 'em to a right Hempen-string Sir. XII Our great States-men and Judges, The Jesuits true Drudges, To advance the Plots of Holy Church Sir; Do make wretched Grimaces, Losing Pensions and Places, To a Parliament left in the lurch Sir. XIII And the young VVelshman's Sre, Stuck like Dun in the Mire, With revengeful Despair looks around him; And then Curses the Crowd, That with Suffrages loud, Shouted (Vive le Roy) when they Crown'd him. XIV He thinks 'tis an hard Fate, Now to Capitulate, And revoke his Indulg'd Dispensations; To his Sons Terms to buckle, To a Parliament truckle, And Eat up his kind Declarations. XV 'Tis hard that dull Hereticks, Still Suspicious of Tricks, Cant believe the young Bantling's his Son Sir; As if Priests cou'd n't create, At least Transubstantiate Him a Boy, for an Heir to his Crown Sir. XVI Nay renown'd Lords and Ladies, A long Bead-row have made us, VVith the Midwife and Learned Physicians; Cannot all this convince, That it is a Welch Prince, Though we publish the plain Depositions? XVII VVell it seems (to be short) There's no Remedy for't, Both his Gods and his Friends are retiring; And his Army falls off, While his Enemies scoff, To see the Prince curb his aspiring. XVIII Have we not a Wise King, To resolve he would bring All to Rome's Lure, or else Sacrifice Sir, Three Kingdoms to his Spleen, And to th'Will of his Queen? Did the world ever hear of a wiser? XIX Without one sturdy fight, He's obliged to alight From the Throne, which he envy'd his Brother, And may like a poor Bigot, Go embarque in a Frigat, To see if he can find such another. XX Since these Switzers and Dutchmen, Come to stand by our Church-men, VVith hard grim Fellows from Fin-land, The Old Politick VVhore, Now must never hope more, To sit brooding o're Plots here against England. XXI Is't not Reason and Sense, If a King will Dispence, VVith our Statutes, and with his own word Sir, To decide the Just Cause, Of Religion and Laws, VVith a swinging Great Protestant-Sword Sir? XXII The French Tyrant dissembles, And huffs, though he trembles, VVe shall Visit that Son of a VVhore Sir: If the weather hold fair, VVe'd fain take a Tour there, As our Fathers did in Days of Yore Sir. XXIII VVhile the Germans before, Pay him off his old score, For the mischief they've felt and do fear Sir, VVith Pipe, Sword and Pistol, VVe shall Probe his old Fistule, And charge the Dog home in the rear Sir. A New Song. [Come, come, great Orange, come away] To the Tune of, Couragio. I Come, come, great Orange, come away, On thy August Voyagio, The Church and State admit no stay, And Protestants wou'd once more say Couragio, Couragio, Couragio. II Stand East, dear Wind, till they arrive, On their design'd Voyagio, And let each Noble Soul alive Cry loud, Qu'il Prince d' Aurange vive! Couragio, &amp;c. III Look sharp, and see the Glorious Fleet, Appear in their Voyagio! With loud Huzza's we will them greet, And with both Arms and Armies meet; Couragio, &amp;c. IV Then, welcome to our English shore, And now I will engage—o, VVe'll thump the Babylonish Whore, And kick her Trump'ries out of Door; Couragio, &amp;c. V Poor B?k! how will thy Dear Joys, Oppose this brave Voyagio? Thy tallest Sparks will be meer Toys, To Brandenburgh and Swedish Boys; Couragio, &amp;c. VI D?n sputters now like mad, Against this great Voyagio; Old C?n too in Sable's clad, And F?m looks wondrous sad; Couragio, &amp;c. VII But Solmes has took a Glorious Cause, In this Warlike Voyagio, To Guard us from their Ravenous Paws, And to protect our Lives and Laws; Couragio, &amp;c. VIII Nassaw will ridicule the Fop, By this Belgic Voyagio, And make their gawdy feathers drop, Their slaughter's but a Harvest Crop: Couragio, &amp;c. IX Stirum, advance the Buda Blades, Thou'st brought in this Voyagio; And since thy Lawrel never fades, Send our Foes to the Stygian shades; Couragio, &amp;c. X Scombergh thunders Heroe-like, In this Stormy Voyagio; His very Name does Horrour strike, And will slay more than Gun or Pike; Couragio, &amp;c. XI Thus they the Victory will gain, After their brave Voyagio; And all our Liberties maintain, And settle Church and State again: Couragio, &amp;c. XII Then 'twill be Just, and no Extream, To see by this Voyagio, That Wem shou'd have th'effect of's Dream, For Driving headlong with the Stream; Couragio, &amp;c. XIII The Judges too, that Traitors be, Must truss by this Voyagio, 'Twill be a Noble Sight to see, Dispencing Scarlet on a Tree! Couragio, &amp;c. XIV The Monks away full swift will hye, On their dismal Voyagio; Ten Pounds a Post-Horse then they cry, And all away to Calis fly; Couragio, &amp;c. XV S?d has Shot the Pit, And is on his Voyagio; Dada must no more hatching sit, And Petre too the Board must quit: Couragio, &amp;c. XVI Old A?l does hang his Ears, Because of this Voyagio; And Miser P?s stews in Tears; B?sis roars, and damns, and swears: Couragio, &amp;c. XVII When all is done, we then shall hope To see, by this Voyagio, No more Nuncio, no more Pope, Except it be to have a Rope; Couragio, Couragio, Couragio. A new Song of an Orange. To that Excellent Old Tune Of a Pudding. Good People come buy, The Fruit that I cry, That now is in Season, tho' Winter is nigh, 'Twill do you all good, And sweeten your Blood, I'm sure it will please you when once understood 'Tis an Orange. Its Cordial Juice, Does much Vigour produce, I may well recommend it to every mans use; Tho' some it quite chills, And with fear almost kills, Yet certain each honest Man benefit feels by an Orange. To make Claret go down, Sometimes there is found A Jolly good Health to pass pleasantly round; But yet I'll protest, Without any Jest, No flavour is better than that of the tast Of an Orange. Perhaps you may think, At White-H? they stink, Because that our Neighbours come over the Sea, Yet sure 'tis presum'd, That they may be perfum'd, By the scent of a Clove, when once it is stuck In an Orange. If they'd cure the ails Of the P? of W? When the Milk of Milch Tyler does not well agree, Tho he's subject to cast, They may better the tast, Yet let 'em take heed left it Curdle at last With an Orange. Old Stories rehearse, In Prose and in Verse, How a Welsh Child was found by loving of Cheese, So this will be known, If it be the Q? own, For the taste it utterly then will disown Of an Orange. Tho the Mobile bawl, Like the Devil and all, For Religion, Property, Justice and Laws; Yet in very good sooth, I'll tell you the truth, There nothing is better to stop a mans mouth Than an Orange. We are certainly told, That by Adam of old, Himself and his Bearns for an Apple was sold; And who knows but his Son, By Serpents undone, And his Juggling Eve may chance lose her own For an Orange. A New Song on the Calling of a Feee Parliament, January 5th, 1688. I A parliament, with one consent Is all the cry oth' Nation, Which now may be, since Popery Is growing out of fashion: The Belgick Troops approach to Town, The Oranges come Powring, And all the Lords agree as one To send the Papists scowring. II The Holy Man shall lead the Van, Our Father and Confessor; In Robes of Red the Jesuits fled, Who was the chief Transgressor. In this disguise he thought to escape, And hop'd to save his Bacon, But H? he has laid a Trap, The Rat may be Retaken. III The Nuncio too, the day may rue That he came o'er the Ocean, I'th' English Court, to keep's Resort, And teach his blind Devotion: The Prelates, Ellis, Smith, and Hall, Have sold their Coach and Horses, And will no longer in White-Hall Foment their Learn'd Discouses. IV The Groom o'th' Stool, that play'd the Fool, Full sorely will repent it, And S?, did barefoot stand For Pennance, shall lament it. M? and the Scotch are fled, Whom hopes of Interest tempted; Those Lords did turn for want of Bread, And ought to be Exempted. V But S?, what cause had he To fear his Highness Landing, Who by his A?s and Legs might pass For one of understanding. To take up Arms at such a time, Against the Rules were gave him; His Head must answer for the Crime, His Pardon will not save him. VI The Fryers and Monks with all their punks, Are now upon the Scamper, T?l Swears, and Rants and Tears, And Teague does make a clamper. The Foreign Priests that Posted o're, Into the English Nation, Do now repent that on that Shore They laid their weak Foundation. VII 'Twou'd be a sight 'twou'd move delight, In each obdurate Varlet, To see the Graves that made us Slaves, Hang in dispensing Scarlet. And every Popish Counsellour, That for the same Cause Pleaded, Shall all turn off at the same score, Be Hang'd or else Beheaded The Second part of Lilli—li burlero Bullen a-la. I By Creist my dear Morish vat makes de sho'shad Lill—li burlero bullen a-la.

V Ara' Plague tauke me now I make a Swar, Lilli burlero bullen a-la, I'd to Shent Tyburn will mauke a great Prayer, Lilli burlero bullen a-la; Lero, lero, &amp;c. Lero, lero, &amp;c.

IX O' Fait and be, I'll mauke de Decree, Lilli burlero bullen a-la, And Swar by de Chancellor's modesty; Lilli burlero bullen a-la, Lero, lero, &amp;c. Lero, lero, &amp;c.

The Chancellour turn'd Tarpaulin. To be a Pris'ner, hated, loath'd, and scorn'd, With unlamented Plagues, thy fall unmourn'd, Under approaching Torments keenest Dread, And 'midst a shouting Crowd unpitied led, To meet a shameful Death, would seem t'attone All horrid Villanies except thy own: But they so numerous, great and loud appear, They dull Repentance, as they heighten fear. Curs'd by your King, your Country, and it seems You're Curs'd too by your own Prophetick Dreams: Curs'd in your Novice Years and Indigence, When Railing was your Law and Eloquence. And Curs'd e'er since for Fraud and Bribery, Lying, Partiality, and Perjury. Curs'd by all People, Prosp'rous and Forlorn, And will be Curs'd by thousands yet unborn. Curs'd by the Just and Virtuous, and what's worse, You have your Fathers and your Childrens Curse. Legions of Ghosts you've murder'd will appear, And whisper, on the Gallows, in your Ear; Your Byass'd Judgment's giv'n against the Good, That you might reek in Mony and in Blood. The Tyrant, when Perillus brought his Bull, Made the Inventor prove the first sad Howl. Your Whipping so (tho late) should well be try'd (Which you found out) upon your bleeding Hide. And thus Condemn'd, you'll be rewarded well With Pill'ry, Carts-Tail, Gibbets, Flames and Hell. And with your Quarters hurl'd into your Grave, Let this be wrote, I was both Fool and Knave, To Law and Drink a Scandal and a Slave. Stafford's Ghost, February 1681. Is this the Heav'nly Crown? Are these the Joys Which bellowing Priests did promise with such noise; Charming my Fears with such lewd Words as these, A Saint, a Martyr, Bliss, Eternal Ease? Such promised Glories were for meaner Deeds. He's trebly blest by whom our Monarch bleeds. Curs'd Priests did me with other Fools delude, Brib'd with their Gifts of the Beatitude. Had I that Life so unadvis'dly lost, 'Tis not your fawning Jesuitish Host, Should e'er prevail on my misguided sense, To smother Guilt with Vows of Innocence: Nor thou, false Friend, as false to me or more, Then all thy Oaths for Coleman's Life before; With thy true Catholick protesting Breath, Should'st e'er betray me to a pejur'd Death. Blinded with Zeal, what, did we once admire A Sulph'rous Soul, by Jesuits set on Fire; A Headstrong, Stupid, Rash Bigotted P? Declar'd the open Enemy to Sense. Weak are the Sacred Ties that should attend The Name of Sov'raign, Brother, and of Friend; This Pious Samson would with Joy o'er throw The Universe, and perish by the Blow; His Plots, tho known, yet will he ne'er give o'er, But still Intreagues with his dear Babel Whore; So much infected by that Fatal Bitch, He's all broke out in Scabby Zeal and Itch. Could we distinctly view his Tainted Soul, That all the Relicks of S? were small, Compar'd with th'Scars of his P? Spiritual: 'Tis not the pow'rful Force of Jordan's Streams, Nor his dear Purgatorys cleansing Flames, Can e're remove from his polluted Soul: The least remains of a Disease so foul: You'll say, 'tis hard that such a one as he Should be depriv'd of Naamans Remedy; But there's distinction to be made, I hope, 'Twixt those that worship Rimmon and the Pope. Amends for my intended Crimes I make, If Charles from his Lethargick Sleep I wake, But such a Dose of Opiats they have given To Rouse him were a Miracle for Heaven; I hope, tho when he hears what I can tell, Success may Crown my Embassy from Hell. I'll boldly name those that pursue his Life, And 'mongst his Subjects fester endless Strife; Their Friends and their Advisers I'll reveal, Those Holy Men that toucht with pious Zeal, Are such Well-wishers to the Common Weal. Y? most Belov'd, and boldest Friend is he, VVho knows he must succeed by Gadbury; Yet some with wonder are surpriz'd to find That in the Loyal Ague of his Mind, His hot Fit comes in such a proper time, VVhose cold one thought the Covenant no Crime. The next a Slave to his Ambitious Pride, Must be the chief, tho of the falling side. This Hot-brain'd Machiavel once vainly strove, For what he ne're can hope the Peoples Love. But foil'd he flies for Refuge to the Throne, Trusting to th'Bladders of his VVit alone, VVithout one Honest Thought to fix them on. The Third a VVrack of the divided Chits. Better than Jilting VVhore he Counterfeits; But not his Treach'rous Eyes dissolv'd in Tears, Nor the false Vizard his Ambition wears, Can blind the VVorld, or hide what must be seen, His Practices with J? and Maz?n. Vote on, poor Fools! ye Commons vent your Spleen Sure France and Y? are a sufficient Screen: A Tax at home's a Project Old and Dull. He'll find new ways to keep the Coffers Full: The French shall some of our fled Gold restore, They suck like Leeches, but they ruin more When they Spue back part of th'infected Ore: 'Tis his Contrivance too, by Change of Air, To ease our Monarch of his Fears and Care They jointly toil to make thy burden light, Knowing that Quiet is thy chief Delight, They therefore haste and hurry thee to fight. No Matter C? thy Enemies they'l fright, One Stamps, one Talks, one VVeeps thy foes to flight, I come (dread Lord) from the dark Shades below To give thee timely notice of the Blow. Which thov may'st yet prevent; think well of those Whom now (mistaken) you believe your Foes. They who against your Will wou'd fix your Crown, Giving your Riches, Happiness, Renown; Which Metamorphose should accepted be, Because redeem'd from Want and Infamy. (Observe poor Wanderer, how thou walk'st alone, Might is the Atlas that supports thy Throne) Haste to comply, defer it not too long, Thou can'st not stem a Current that's so strong. Trust to th'Affections of thy Britains bold, Give them but leave thy Honour to uphold; Tho Bessus, yet a Cæsar thou may'st be, Opprest with Trophies of their Victory. On the D?ss of P?th's Picture, Sept. 1682. Who can on this Picture look, And not strait be wonder strook, That such a peaking doudy thing, Should make a Beggar of a King? Three happy Nations turn to Tears, And all their former Love to Fears; Ruine the Great, and raise the Small, Yet will by turns betray 'um All Lowly born, and meanly bred, Yet of this Nation is the Head: For half Whitehall make her their Court, Tho th'other half make her their sport. Monmouth's Tamer, Jeffery's Advance, Foe to England, Spye for France; False and foolish, proud and bold, Ugly as you see, and Old. In a word, her mighty Grace Is Whore in all things but her Face. All Shams. To the Tune of, Packington's Pound. I An Invasion from Dutchland is all the discourse, And incredible Tale of Incredible force! While each graver Sir Pol unfolded his Sheet, An exact Computation of Army and Fleet: Of their Horse and their Foot, And their Great Guns to boot, Each Fireship, each Tender, and Flat-bottom'd Boat; The time of their Landing, and place, can reveal, But that, as a secret, as yet he'l conceal. II While each busie-brain'd Machnie, and Fool, Each chattering Barber, each Aporn and Rule; Let his private concern be of ne'r so much weight, And nought but his Trade he can call his Estate: Yet straight he declares, It has long been his Fears, He dreaded this business for several Years: Nay, the future events he cou'd easily relate; But 'tis dangerous, Neighbours, and touches the State. III Now while we are hearing and telling of Lyes, A Cloud from the West does quite darken the Skies: All Ægypt's ten Plagues do at once on us fall, For, in Naming the Irish, it comprehends all: To what purpose they come Is no secret to Rome; And, to guess at the consequence, we may presume: Old England was ne're so unhappy before, While the Scum of three Nations for aid we Implore. IV Now lay by Chimeras of Fleets, and Armados, And, if you can, fairly march off to Barbadoes, Jamaica, Virginia, or any Plantation, Except that of Will Pen, the disturber o'th' Nation; To Lapland, or Greenland, Nay sail into Finland, To Presbyter John, or the Islands within Land: And leave both your Honors, Estates and your Wives, On condition that you may depart with your Lives. Fumbumbis: or the North-Country-Mayor. A Ballad. To the Tune of, Packinton's Pound. [I] I sing of no Heretic, Turk, or of Tartar, But a suffering Mayor, who may pass for a Martyr; For a story so Tragic was never yet told By Fox, or by Stow, those Authors of old; How a vile Lansprezado, Did a Mayor Bastinado, And play'd him a Trick worse than a Strapado. Oh Mayor, Mayor, thou had'st better never Transub'd, Than thus to be toss'd in a Blanket, and drub'd. II All laugh'd to behold this Saint of a Mayor To Heav'n assum'd on a Colstaff of Air; From the Earth to the Skies they removed his station, So quick, you'd have thought it Transubstantiation: Our Hereticks boast, He for turning was toss'd, And sent up, to catch the Religion h' had lost. Oh Mayor, Mayor, &amp;c. III Not Quixot himself was ever less daunted For charging the Windmils, or Gyants Inchanted. A mind so resolv'd what danger cou'd threaten? 'The Hero's the same, whether beat or is beaten: And the Cudgels and Stones May bruise and break Bones; Tis the manner of Kicking for Kicking attones. Oh Mayor, Mayor, &amp;c. IV The various Effects of his VVorship's disgrace Might have spoil'd the Bel-Air of a modester Face; But such an assurance his cause does admit, He discovers as little of shame, as of wit: For, besides the expence, Wou'd one Post from thence To prove himself such a Poltroon to his Prince! Oh Mayor, Mayor, thou'd'st better have never Transub'd Than thus to be toss'd in a Blanket and Drub'd! Essay written over his Door upon an Institution and Induction. I 'Tis a strange thing to think on That old Tom of Lincoln, Who writ for the Reformation, Shou'd so basely submit, Without honor, or Wit, To the Reading the Declaration. II Who ever takes Order From this Satan-Recorder, And thinks to go out a Divine, Will find it a Folly To expect the Ghost Holy, 'Tis the Devil that enters the Swine A Heroick Scene. Enter Oliver's Porter, Fidler, and Poet in Bedlam. The Scene adorned with several of the Poets own Flowers, known by the Itallick Character. Porter. O glory! Glory! who are these appear? My Fellow-Servants, Poet, Fidler here? Old Hodge the Constant, Johnny the Sincere. Who sent you hither? And pray tell me why An horrid silence does Invade mine Eye, While not one sound of Voice from you I spye. Johnny. I come to let thee know, the time is now To turn and fawn, and flatter as we do, And follow that which does too fast pursue. Be wise, neglect your Interest now no more; Interest! The Prince we serve, the God w' adore. I for the Royal Martyr first declar'd; But, e're his Head was off, I was prepar'd To own the Rump, and for that Cause did Rhime; But those kick'd out, next Moment turn'd to him Who routed them: Call'd him my Soveraign, And prais'd his opening of a Kingly Vein. Hodge. I by my Lowring Planets was accurst To be for barren Loyalty at first; But when to Nolls, our Charles's fate gave place, I could abjure the Unhappy Royal Race: To Noll I all my fingers skill did show, And charm'd his Highness with my nimble Bow. Besides, I serv'd him as a faithful Spy, And did decoy the Cavalierish Fry; Gold from his bounteous Highness charm'd my Eyes, My old Whore Balt Gl?ss could ne're suffice For the Expence and Equipage of spies. Johnny. Come joyn with us to make our Party strong, And you can never be in Bedlam long. Hodge. Were you yet Madder you might serve the state, And be concern'd in things of greatest weight. Johnny. For (as Turks their Santons) we adore The Fools and Madmen, and their aid implore: They're such who share my Panegyrick Verse, Hodge. To such I write, not to Philosophers. Porter. Such frequent turns should you to Bedlam bring From Rump to Cromwell, Cromwell to the King; Then to your Idol Church, next to the Pope, Which may one day prefer you to the Rope: I amongst Madmen am confin'd 'tis true, But I have more solidity than you. Johnny. A Windmill is not fickle; for we find That it is always constant to the Wind: I never change; I'm still to Interest true; The Conquerour ever does my Muse subdue; And with whatever Tossing she shall meet, She, like a Cat, shall light upon her feet. Hodge. How long did I write for the English Church, Yet now think fit to leave her in the lurch: Like Will o'th'-Wispe th'Inferiour Clergy I Led into Quagmires, where I let them lie; Some into Boggs and Ditches I have cast, Where let them flounder what they will, they're fast: So far Crape-Gown is plung'd into the mire, It is not possible it should retire. Porter. My Spirit boils within my troubled Breast, These Rogues are come to interrupt my rest. Johnny. When the Exalted Whiggs were in their I spent my Oyl and Labour on their side. Wrote a Whigg Play, and Shaftsbury out-ran; For all my Maxims were Republican; For the Excluding-Bill I did declare, Libell'd and Rail'd, and did no Monarch spare: When they began to droop I fac'd about, And with my Pen I damn'd the Whiggish rout. Nay every turn before-hand I can find, As your sagacious Hog foresees the Wind. Hodge. You nimbly turn to that which does prevail, No Seaman e're could sooner shift his Sail. Johnny. Like a true Renegado still I maul The party I forsook with utmost gall. Hodge. So I ere long shall damn the Heretick Souls Of my old Comrade Coffee-Priests near Pauls. Spies upon all their Pulpits I maintain, And if of Rome, or Slavery they complain, Or for their own against our Church they Preach; I roar as if they did Sedition Teach; I brand the Person with most Venemous Lies If I want Truth, Invention still supplies. Johnny. But a reserve I kept for Monmouth still, Should he prevail, I with such equal skill With Satyr-mingled praise he could not take it Ill. And had that Prince Victorious been at Lime, I the Black-Box had justified in Rhime. I was prepar'd to praise or to abhor him, Satyr I had and Panegyrick for him. [Por. aside.] Oh feed of Locusts, from the Infernal Lake You'l cause my anger and I'le make you quake. Hodge. Long my sly pen serv'd Rome, and I atchiev'd Ample Rewards, whole sholes of Priests deceiv'd. I wrought with such Imperceptible Tools, That I of heaps of Guineas gull'd those Fools: The only Bubbles in the World they be, Who, to their cost, must feel before they see: In publick yet the English Church I own, Tho' I am subtilly Writing of it down; For yet it is not time I should declare Lest Fools, to whom I write, should be aware. Johnny. Men best themselves 'gainst open foes defend, But perish surely by a seeming Friend; One Son turn'd me, I turn'd the other two; But had not an Indulgence, Sir, like you; I felt my Purse insensibly consume Till I had openly declar'd for Rome. Hodge. Now fellow Servant pray at length be wise And follow our Example and Advice. Porter. VVhat! turn to Rome, who did our City burn? And wou'd our Ancient Government o'return? Hodge. Hold! Is not the Inscription blotted out? Por. Therefore who burnt the City none need doubt. Johnny. It was Almighty Fire from Heav'n came down To punish the Rebellious stiff-neck'd Town; All which had perish'd in devouring flames, Tho on the fire y'had emptied all the Thames; Had all its Waves been on the Houses tost, It had but basted them as they did rost; But Heaven a Chrystal Pyramid did take, Of that a broad Extinguisher did make In Firmamental Waters dipt above, To Hood the Flames which to their Quarry strove. Porter. A Pyramid Extinguisher to Hood! 'Tis Nonsense never to be understood. Hod. What, you believe the Plot of Varlet Oates? Por. Ten Proclamations and Four Senates Votes. John. That Godfreys Life was by the Papists sped? Por. Oh, No! He kill'd himself when he was dead. Hod. To Jesuits dying you will Credit give. Por. Yes! full as much as all the while they live. But dying Protestants I'le not believe, For they allow of neat Equivocation, And of flat Lies, with Mental Reservation. John. Hark Hodge: To gain him we in vain contend, Our Fellow Servant is a Wagg, dear Friend. Hodge. I'le try him farther; for his Parts are such, To bring him o're must needs avail us much, Who are for Rome &amp; France 'gainst th'English &amp; the Dutch Come Fellow Servant, you blieve our Plot Of Russel, H?n, Sydney, and what not? Of B?, Walcot, of Bow-steeple and the Rye Por. For R?l would, but H?n wou'd not Lie, Rumbald and Walcot too did both deny Ayloff to boot; but Cowards are not brave; For Fear's a Passion which all Cowards have: Yet to the Plot I firm belief afford, Of th'Evidence I credit not one word. Johnny. Can you distrust what G? and E? say? Port. What! two such Excellent Moral Men as they! Hod. Others there are swore home as Men cou'd do. Por. Who for their Lives must swear home 'tis true. Against the Popish Crew none ever swore But a full Pardon he obtain'd before; These Swearers are like Cormorants, for they, On Whiggs with ropes about their gullets prey. John. What then? will you not be to Interest true? We both are of the same belief with you; But we know better what we have to do. Por. aside. Did ever Hell send such a brace of Knaves; Such abject Cowards, Mercenary Slaves! [Exit frowning. John. His looks are wild, his fiery Eye-balls roul, A Raging Tempest's labouring in his Soul. Let's prudently retire. Porter Re-enters with a great Bible given him by Nell G. Por. You sneaking Rogues would you be gone? Here's that shall knock both you and Popery down. He knocks them down with the Bible, and stamps upon them, they get up. Hodge. Rash Man! for this I full revenge will take, And set our Evidence upon your back. John. Audacious Fool, how dare you tempt your fate? Provoking me a Pillar of the State, Who with my Pen alone have turn'd the Scale, And made the Tories o're the Whiggs prevail? Hodge. Your Pen alone!— Can I this Arrogance endure to hear, Wou'd you usurp the Garland I should wear? Johnny. You with your Forty Eight, and Forty One, VVith Screws and Antipendiums plagu'd the Town; VVhile even the Whiggs admir'd my lofty Verses, Your VVitless Prose did Fodder Torys Arses. Hodge. I'll through your Arse touch Honour to the quick, And find if you have any by this kick. [Kicks the Poet. Johnny. Kick on, old Fool, till you your Toes shall maul, I have had several, and can bear them all: Besides, I'm us'd to't— Porter. Hence you wretched Slaves, There is Contagion in such Fools and Knaves. I'll wring your Necks off, if you ever more Presume to set your feet within this door: I'm Chief, and have Dominion in this place. Johnny. I'll spend my gushing blood upon thy Face; And if thou dar'st effect thy dire Design With my two Hands I'll fling my Head at thine. Porter. Holloa St. Dennis, have at you. Johnny. Murder, Murder! [He kicks and beats them, they run roaring out. Hodge. Help, Help! Porter. I on these Knaves shall never more complain, They have call'd back my wandring sense again. [He Pawses, and seems to come to himself. Of all Mankind, happy alone are we, From all Ambition, from all Tumults free: No Plots nor vile Informers need we fear; No Plagues, nor Tortures for Religion here. Our Thoughts, nay even our very words are free, Not damn'd by Fines, or loss of Liberty; None here's impeach'd by a vile Table spye, VVho with an Innuendo backs his lye; VVords and Lampoons we laugh at, and ne're care VVhat's said by Men, if Actions they forbear; Anger at words is weakness understood, Since none can Ridicule ought that is good; 'Tis VVomanish, and springs from Impotence, For no great Man at words e're took Offence. At Rome, in all her Glory, words were free; Just Governments can never Jealous be; But when to Tyranny Rome did decline, VVeak Emperours with Delatores join To plague the people, and themselves undo; For when they're fear'd they must be hated too. And whom Men hate with Ruin they'll pursue. One VVitness and a Circumstance for Facts, Is not enough; we must prove Overt Acts. Our happy Government makes no Offence, But open and Rebellious Violence. VVhich we to quell no standing Army need, Nor can Dragoons upon free Quarter feed; Booted Apostles we have none, that come To knock and beat Men to the Church of Rome; VVhen its Butt-end prevails not, Torments will, For Lewis is not yet so Merciful to kill. Here we divided from the troubled VVorld, Rest and are into no Confusions hurl'd; For all our wants does our wise State provide Here ev'ry Vacant place is still supply'd, VVith Persons that are duly qualify'd; No favour raises a Desertless Knave, Nor Infamy, nor yet the Gold he gave. How would all Subjects envy us, shou'd we Publish the secrets of our Hierarchy? The True Way to Honour. I Wou'd you (Sir) attain that Honour, Favourites neither know nor mind, March under Vertue's Noble Banner, Change not Faith with each Court Wind. Neither pray to Saint nor Lady, Their Religion's but a Jest, Who kneel down to a painted Baby, Worshipping the Roman Beast. II Why in the Youth yet Interested, That's a point I can't reach, Cause Monarchs have the Sparks addressed, Must that belief and Duty teach? Well, since we may not dispute that matter, This I hope will be confess'd, Who build their Faith on Holy Water, Worship to the Roman Beast. III In short, the best way to promotion, Is to make the Laws your Rule, And truckle to such blind Devotion, Which does Religion ridicule. VVhat tho their Cause a while prevails, Stick you to that endures the Test, Let them cry up their P? of W?, VVho worship to the Roman Beast. A New Litany. To the Tune of, Cook Lawrei invited the Devil his Guest, &amp;c. From Jesuitical Polls, who proudly Expose The only Bulwark 'twixt them, and their Foes, To Ramble i'th' Night to see Rare shows; For ever Good Lord deliver me. From a Pious Wise K? who lets his reign pass, In raising of Villains, and hearing of Mass, All whose designs still prove but mine A?; For ever, &amp;c. Who is rid, and impos'd on, by many a score Of Priests, Mac's, and Footmen, his Q. and his W? Who to make his Foes Rich, will make his Friends Poor; For ever, &amp;c. Who without doing business still o're it does Buz, Takes always wrong Measures in all that he does, As prepostrous in State as H? in's Cloaths; For ever, &amp;c. Who has made his Religion a Ridiculous Jest, And sells all his Friends to buy off the Test, Yet gives it his Servants from biggest to least; For ever, &amp;c. From a P?ce in whose word and promise no trust is, And a Court without Conscience, Honour and Justice, Who's bus'ness, Pride, Flattry, Intrest, and Lust is; For ever, &amp;c. From a blinking Confessor, as free of his Word, And as slack in performance as his disciplin'd Lord, Whose Merits in time may meet with a Cord; For ever, &amp;c. From Petres that positive Politick Sage, Who shame upon Heav'n, and comforts his Age, In filling his Coffers, and Bugg'ring his Page; For ever, &amp;c. From a Turn-coat, Mail-setting, King-killing Rascal, Who spight of those Villanies, which he's past all, Is become a Kings Favourite, ev'n from a Stall; For ever, &amp;c. From a Hosier preferr'd before all the State blocks, From Preaching in Tubs, and footing of Socks, And giving Quack Bills to cure the Pox; For ever, &amp;c. Who had hang'd in Hones stead with a handsomer face, And the Joiner had gain'd the Counsellours place, If to impeach first he had had but the Grace; For ever, &amp;c. From a Nation, which now in so woful a case is, To be call'd by Church Cheats, and Jesuitical Clashes, Who their Politicks learn from whipping boys A? For ever, &amp;c. A Match, between the keen Rasor, and the dull Ax, 1683. Occasioned by the death of the Lord Russel and the E. of Essex. [I.] Ten Pounds to a Crown, (who will make the match) On Bomini's head, against Squire Catch; Whose Instrument shall make most quick dispatch. The Noble Rasor, or the Ax In Bulk, (perhaps) not Virtue, lacks; Which, by rare slight of hand, can do More at one stroke, than that at two: So Gems are precious, which unite In little Orbs, great Rays of Light: More subtle than th'Inchanted Sword, Which slew twice o'er The Knight, once slain before; For thou cou'dst kill, Against thy will, And his, and ours, a Noble Lord. II. Dead doing Tool! surely just Fate Will dub thee now the Ax of State; If first the grateful Heav'ns shall not Translate The thither, to maintain The Regiment of C? his VVain. But gentle Muse, I pray thee tell, What made that Hack, this Shave so well: And why the dapper Monsieur can Out-do the heavy Englishman? Did the old Ax, on that great day, It went away To Rome, to be Enshrin'd, Steal all the Steel; and only Iron leave behind? Or did the Hone Sharpen the Rasor, to the Ax give none? III. VVou'd you this Riddle understand; Distinguish 'twixt the Butcher's clumsy Hand, And the invisible Command, Divines allow, the unseen Powers May wonders work; and why not ours, VVhether on Scaffolds, or in Towers? All you, whose Lot It once may be to go to Pot, VVhen e'er the State shall hit your Blot; And you whose Heads by sullen Fates Are doom'd to fall at these hard rates: Pray use your Barbers cheaper Art, And let your bungling Butchers bear no Part. Now, for a curious Youth to cut your Throats, VVho (on occasion fine, and neat) VVill do the clever Feat; Let trusty Monsieur preingage your ready Votes. A New Litany in the Year, 1684. From Immoderate Fines and defamation, From Braddons Pennyless Subornation, And from a Bar of Assassination, Libera nos, &amp;c. From a Lawyer that scolds like an Oyster Wench, From an English Body, and a Mind that is French, And from the new Bonner upon the Bench, Libera nos, &amp;c. From the Partial Preaching that is now in Fashion, From Divinity to undo a Nation, From Wooden Shoes, and Transubstantiation, Libera nos, &amp;c. From the Nonsencial cant of a Loyal Addressor From the Impudent Shams of Popish Professor, And from Protestant Zeal in a Popish Successor, Libera nos, &amp;c. From all those Esau's within their Nonage, That would both our Laws and Liberties Forage, And sell their Birthright for a Mess of a Court Pottage, Libera nos, &amp;c. From Juries that Murther do Justice call, And undoing of Men a Matter but small, And from the Star-Chamber in Westminster-Hall, Libera nos, &amp;c. The Fable of the Pot and Kettle, as it was told by Collonel Titus the Night before he Kiss'd the Kings Hand. As down the Torrent of an angry Flood, An Earthen Pot, and a Brass Kettle flow'd; The heavy Caldron, sinking and distress'd By his own Weight, and the fierce VVaves oppress'd, Slily bespoke the lighter Vessels Aid; And to the Earthen Pitcher friendly said, Come, Brother, why should we divided lose The strength of Union, and our selves expose To the Insults of this poor paltry Stream, Which with united Forces we can stem? Tho different heretofore have been our Parts, The Common Danger reconciles our Hearts; Here, lend me thy kind Arm to break the Flood. The Pitcher this New Friendship understood, And made this Answer; Tho I wish for Ease And Safety, this Alliance does not please; Such different Natures never will agree, Your Constitution is too rough for me; If by the Waves I against you am tost, Or you to me, I equally am lost; And fear more Mischief from your hard-end-side, Than from the Shores, the Billows, or the Tide: I calmer Days and ebbing Waves attend, Rather than buoy you up, and serve your end, To perish by the Rigor of my Friend. The Moral. Learn hence (ye Whigs) and act no more like Fools, Nor trust their Friendship who wou'd make you Tools; While empty Praises and smooth Flatt'rys serve; Pay with feign'd Thanks, what their feign'd smiles deserve: But let not the Alliance farther pass, For know that you are Clay, and they are Brass. Epitaph on Harry Care. A true Dissenter here does lye indeed, He ne'er with any, or himself agreed; But rather than want subjects to his spight, Wou'd Snake-like turn, and his own Tail wou'd bite. Sometime, 'tis true, he took the faster side, But when he came by suff'ring to be try'd, The Craven soon betray'd his Fear and Pride: Thence, Settle-like, he to recanting fell Of all he wrote, or fanci'd to be well; Thus purg'd from good; and thus prepar'd by evil, He fac'd to Rome, and marcht off to the Devil. A New Way to Honour. [I] Wou'd you be a Man of Honour, Wou'd you be advanc'd to Place, Take Measures from good Bishop Bonner, And Maxims from Tyrconnel's Grace? Pray to a Lady that can hear ye; Who, as She's Greatest, is the Best; Your Suit is granted, never fear ye, If you'l worship to the Est. II Next in her Son get interessed, That's a Point must be believ'd; Mighty Kings have been Addressed, Monarchs cannot be deceiv'd. Come, come, ne'er dispute the Matter, That Religion must be best, Which purges sin with Holy Water, Therefore worship to the Est, III In short, if you wou'd gain Promotion, Do as Holy Church Commands, Be constantly at her Devotion, And serve her with your Heart and Hands: Tis our Religion now prevails, Therefore still maintain the Jest, Swear Fealty to the P? of W? And worship always to the Est. A Lenten Prologue refus'd by the Players, 1682. Our Prologue-Wit grows flat: the Naps worn off; And howsoe'er We turn, and trim the Stuff, The Gloss is gone, that look'd at first so gaudy; 'Tis now no Jest to hear young Girls talk Baudy. But Plots, and Parties give new matter birth; And State Distractions serve you here for mirth! At England's cost Poets now purchase fame While Factious Heats destroy us, without Shame These wanton Neroes fiddle to the Flame. The Stage, like old Rump pulpits, is become The Scene of News, a furious Party's Drum. Here Poets beat their Brains for Volunteers, And take fast hold of Asses by their Ears. Their jingling Rhime for Reason here you swallow; Like Orpheus Musick makes Beasts to follow. What an enlightning Grace is want of Bread? How it can change a Libeller's Heart, &amp; clear a Laureats Head! Open his Eyes till he the Mad Prophet see Medal. p.41. Plots working in a future power to be Traitors unform'd to his Second Sight are clear; And Squadrons here, and Squadrons there appear; Rebellion is the Burden of the Seer. To Bays in Vision were of late reveal'd Whigg Armies, that at Knightsbridg lay conceal'd. Reher. Com. p. 31. And tho no mortal Eye could see't before The Battel was just entring at the Door! Rehears. Comedy p. 52. A dangerous Association—sign'd by None! The Joyners Plot to seize the King alone! Stephen with College made this Dire compact; The watchful Irish took 'em in the Fact— Of riding arm'd! Oh Traiterous Overt Act! With each of 'em an ancient Pistol sided; Against the Statute in that Case provided. But why was such an Host of Swearers prest? Their succour was ill Husbandry at best. Bays's crown'd Muse by Sovereign Right of Satyr, Without desert can dub a man a Traitor. And Toryes, without troubling Law, or Reason, By Loyal Instinct can find Plots and Treason. But here's our Comfort; though they never scan The Merits of the Cause, but of the Man, Our gracious Statesmen vow not to forsake Law—that is made by Judges whom they Make. Behind the Curtain, by Court-Wires, with ease Thy turn those Plyant Puppets as they please. With frequent Parliaments our hopes they feed, Such shall be sure to meet—but when there's Need. When a sick State, and sinking Church call for 'em, Then 'tis our Tories most of all abhor 'em. Then Pray'r, that Christian Weapon of defence, Grateful to Heaven, at Court is an Offence, If it dare speak th'untamper'd Nations sense. Nay Paper's Tumult, when our Senates cease; And some Mens Names alone can break the Peace. Petitioning disturbs the Kingdom's Quiet; As choosing honest Sheriffs makes a Ryot. To punish Rascals, and bring France to Reason, Is to be hot, and press things out of Season; And to damn Popery is Irish Treason. To love the King, and Knaves about him hate, Is a Fanatick Plot against the State. To Skreen his Person from a Popish Gun Has all the mischief in't of Forty One. To save our Faith, and keep our Freedom's Charter, Is once again to make a Royal Martyr. This Logick is of Tory's deep inditing The very best they have—but Oaths, and Fighting. Let 'em then chime it on, if 'twill oblige ye, And Roger vapour o'er us in Effigie. Let 'em in Ballads give their folly Vent, And sing up Nonsense to their Hearts content. If for the King (as All's pretended) they Do here drink Healths, and curse, sure we may pray, Heaven once more keep him then for Healing Ends, Safe from old Foes—but most from his new Friends! Such Protestants as prop a Popish Cause, And Loyal Men, that break all Bounds of Laws! Whose Pride is with his Servants Salaries fed, And when they've scarce left him a Crust of Bread, Their corrupt Fathers foreign Steps to follow, Cheat even of scraps, and that last Sop would swallow. French Fetters may this Isle no more endure; Spite of Rome's Arts stand England's Church secure, Not from such Brothers as desire to mend it, But false Sons, who designing worse to rend it With leud Lives, and no Fortunes would defend it. Dangerfield's Ghost to J? Revenge! Revenge! my injur'd Shade begins To haunt thy guilty Soul, and scourge thy sins: For since to me thou ow'st the heaviest score, Whose Living words tormented thee before, When Dead, I'm come to plague thee yet once more. Don't start away, nor think thy Brass to hide, But see the dismal shape in which I dy'd! My Body all deform'd with putrid Gore, Bleeding my Soul away at every Pore; Pusht faster on by Francis, less unkind; My Body swoln, and bloated as thy Mind. This dangling Eye-Ball rolls about in vain, Never to find its proper seat again, The hollow Cell usurpt by Blood and Brain: The trembling Jury's Verdict ought to be Murder'd at once, by Francis, and by Thee. The Groans of Orphans, and the pondrous guilt Of all the Blood that thou hast ever spilt; Thy Counteys Curse, the Rabbles Spite, and all Those Wishes sent thee since thy long-wisht Fall; The Nobles just Revenge, so bravely bought, For all the Ills thy Insolence has wrought: May these and more their utmost force combine, Joyn all their Wrongs, and mix their Cries with mine. And see, if Terror has not struck thee blind; See here a long, a ghastly Train behind! Far, far, from utmost WEST they crowd away, And hov'ring o'er, fright back the sickly Day; Had the poor Wretches sinn'd as much as Thee, Thou shou'dst not have forgot Humanity: Who e'er in Blood can so much pleasure take? Tho an ill Judge wou'd a good Hang-man make. Each hollows in thy Ears,—Prepare! Prepare For what thou must, yet what thou canst not bear! Each, at thy Heart a bloody Dagger aims, Upward to Gibbets point, downward to enless Flames. The Troop at Beaconsfield and their March. [I] A medley of Ruffians, bound up in a Band, The shame of their Sex, &amp; the Pest of the Land, Like Blood-hounds train'd up to the Word of Command. II To hunt in a Pack, who single wou'd flye, And tho fierce to others, yet supplicant lye To be beat by their Keepers, like Dogs, till they cry. III Each one in Armor, like a Crab in his Case, On a Horse that can wisely find for him his Place, And place his Red Nose to his Leaders broad A?se. IV With a Curse at his Mouth, and a Shot in his Gun, The one to storm Quarters, the other storm Town, And a Sword that 'gainst Poultry has Miracles done. V With Tears of the March from Bastard-big-Whore, Petitions and Curses from Tapster for Score, And honest Men's Wishes to see 'em no more. VI The Trumpet their Actions and Order does sound, The Corporal aloud must the Meaning expound To each Horse how his Rider must keep to his Ground. VII The Files being straitn'd; the Ranks being even, And all things reduced to Sixes and Sevens, The Blundering Lieutenant swears Thanks up to Heaven. VIII The Captain then struts on his Barbary-Nag, Looks Grim, and the Cornet advances the Flag, The Trumpet does sound, and then marches Tag-rag. IX The Dogs they do bark, and the Poultry run, Their meeting on each hand the Passengers shun, And Curses are after them shot from the Town. X Where springs a glad Din 'mongst the Girls and the Boys; The Females they lift up the Heart and the Voice, The Whores to Lament, and the Chast to rejoice. XI The Countrey and Towns-men do meet, and condole For what has been scor'd, and what has been stole, For Damages, Cuts, and for Knocks on the Pole. XII But when they examine, and find that the Tub, Tho mightily wrong'd, yet retaineth some Bub, They drink, and shake hands, to each Loss and each Drub. XIII Good God! when a Prince thou dost give us again, Such Faith and such Principles in him ordain, His Friends may live Safely, and he without Pain. XIV By the Laws of the Land, and Melitia's old Force, Instead of these Legions of Foot and of Horse, And Irish Dragoons than Devils far worse. XV Then France may her Models of Government keep, Our Seamen return, and go plow on the Deep, And Justice and Trade may revive from their sleep. SONG. [Keep to the Church, while yet you may] To the Tune of, Gather your Rose-Buds, &amp;c. [I] Keep to the Church, while yet you may, Now Sects are still a growing, And Popery that buds to day, To Morrow will be blowing. II We Dance an endless Circle round, Like Fairies in Religion, While the Italian gets the Ground; And calls us senseless Widgeon. III The Presbyterian leads the Van, And next the Independent, The Dapper Quaker then comes in But Popery's the end on't. IV Then be not Wedded to the New, But in the Old way tarry, For having once but left the New, You may for ever vary. A true and full Account of a late Conference between the wonderful Speaking-Head and Father Pulton, as it was related by the Heads own Mouth to Dr. F?r, 1686. I that was once an humble Logg, The pissing Post for every Rogue; And did hope for nothing higher, Than to grace a Christmass Fire, From th'Element escaped hard, By th'Favour of F???et Shepherd; VVho, being a Friend to Mathematicks, Do's for Virtuoso's lay Tricks; Did procure a Man of Art, That gave me Voice Articulate, Taught me Tongues the most difficile, To sing Sawney, Laugh and VVhistle. Follow'd now by Court and City, I confound with my strange Ditty, Both the Learned and the VVitty: And make all the Talk at Betty's, By the help of my Friend P?s. For you VVits were always good To the Family of VVood, And before kept such a puther VVith the Groaning Board my Brother, Some Men think you know our Mother. And I hope both you and they Sir, VVill favour me sweet Dr. F?r, To help me out but with one Jest; Let me alone for all the rest; For my wondrous Voices sound, Is much admir'd by the Beau Mond, VVho to me pay more Devotion Than to pretty Punches Motion. Many a Lady bright and fine Lays her Cherry Lips to mine, And without offence I smack her Till I rub off all my Lacker; VVith that Sex I more prevail Than any Head that wants a Tail. The King to Court sent for my Timber As kind as if I had been a Member, And found me an obedient Head That did agree to all he said; Which being strange, pleas'd him so much, He wish'd that all the House were such; And 'twould much advance his Cause, If such Noddles could make Laws. This indeed's a mighty Comfort, But, alas! I am paid home for't. Busie Priests with their Disputing, Reasoning, Arguing, and Confuting, Who with Charms Ecclesiastick, Can make good Catholick of a Stick: Do torment and plague me more Than without Ears I ever bore; May I be a Logg again, To avoid their Noisy Train. Pulton t'other Night did come, (If I Lie, may I be Dumb, Or may a Plague I wish my Foes, Will R???s blow into my Nose,) And brought a Letter sign'd S. Petre, That he'd privately Confer with me. I at the Challenge did not flinch, But bid him sit down on my Bench; And since he had so good a Warrant, Blow in my Mouth, and tell his Errand. Says he, I Missionary come, Ad Partes Infidelium; For your Faith cannot be good, That springs from Shepherds and hard Wood: I to all Blockheads am the Legate, And gain some in spight of Clegat. They alone our Business must do, Who han't a grain of Sense to trust to. 'Tis not my Province to Confute Those that think and can Dispute; And here we need not such Expences, Since our Nation suits our Senses. Nothing is so apt and fit For our Doctrine, as your Wit, And he is most our Enemy Who is most removed from thee. Oh! happy Off-spring of the Maple, To praise thee enough I am not able. Oh! what comfort dost thou show Men In thy lucky Faces Omen? Times will come again, I see, When England shall adore a Tree; When Oracles old Poets shall utter, Wafers bleed, and Flints sweat Butter. If in Mother Church you stood, You'd do Wonders like the Rood; In her Sacred Bosom foster'd, What might we hope from such a Costard; For you might convert the Nation, Since you speak by Inspiration. While he thus foam'd with Holy Rage, B?y with pale Visage, To bring my late Conveyance home, Came by chance into the Room, And look'd on him as well as me, Like Ghost of little Shaftsbury; The frightned Priest let fall the Matter, And headlong down the Stairs did clatter; Nor could sustain in any place The Terror of that hated Face. I in this Deliverance blest, Got in my Chest, and went to rest. A new Address to Mr. Bays, on his late Conversion to the Church of Rome. Hast thou at last that Mother Church too quitted, To which thy Laymans Faith so oft submitted? To gain whose Grace, and keep thy self from want, Thou didst thy Fathers Principles recant; Sinn'd against all the sense thou didst inherit, And choak'd the Motions of thy Grandsire's Spirit. Has then establish'd VVorship lost her Charms? And does blind Admirer Bays fly to an Outlaws arms? She who thy VVit to joyn with Law still bred, And of thy Conscience had the Maidenhead; VVho nurs'd with Care thy pliant-passive Nature, And sanctify'd thy base-time-serving Satyr; Can she e're lose that true Adorers Heart, VVhom from Bawd R???s three Shankers could not part? Thou, who thy Neck, thy Ears, thy Soul did venture, To libel Whiggs, art thou turn'd a Dissenter? VVell doth this Change, which thou to curse may'st live, Expound thy blustering for Prerogative; Some Sense those Rhymes had, which we thought all Rank, This is the Key to thy complying Cant; Drawing the Curtain from Long-framing Scenes, Thou tell'st us (now at last) what [Loyal] means, See here, ye Sots who serv'd the same vile Cause, The end of Faith, that hangs on Human Laws! VVere with more ease did Love from friendship grow, Than Toryism up to Popery will flow. From having sold, with a Poetic Dotage, Our ancient Birthrights for a Mess of Pottage; From a Defence of Civil Cheat, and Nonsense, VVith a Brass-Forehead, and Case-hard'n'd Conscience, Like a Bilow, who durst all Laws defy, To like Imposture in a Church thou dost for a safety fly; After long Floating to a Faith thou'rt driven, Where all thy villany may be forgiven, Nay us'd, and hallow'd, to restore her see, Rome has no Hope while Men from Force are free, But by such Fortune-Followers, as Thee. How did the Whore open her filthy Breast, And with spread Arms receive a Rogue profest! Methinks already with the Beasts own brand Mark'd, in her Calender I see thee stand! Hard by the Noble Army of Church-braves, Among the goodly Fellowship of Knaves! Who, to allay the Ferment of Divisions, Have into Veins Basilic made Incisions, And play'd the Devils Part in Apparations; To give fresh Dread to the Pope's slighted Thunders, Have at the Altar acted Lying Wonders, As Boys do Proverbs, and reviv'd the spell, To prove Impossible by Miracle, The better with their Bubble to succeed, And Faith in Stubborn-Stony-Hearts to bleed, Made Pictures bow, and broken Wafers bleed; VVhen e're this Bitch, their spiritual Mother, will'd, Their Countrey's Father have depos'd or kill'd; Brought Hecatombs of Hereticks to the Flame, And VVorlds laid wast to spread her impious Name. This Party may'st thou never disavow, Ne're were thy Morals so well-match'd, as now, Fact, Scripture, Reason, Common sense defying, 'Tis they alone could equal thee in Lying: Since Man in Gods Name cheated, never yet Was Church for Saint, or Saint for Church more fit. Oh, may'st thou reason for it, as of late Thou did'st in Prefaces for the Crown and State! In spite of a Fr? League, and Jesuit's Wit, Such fulsom Fooling might preserve us yet; Such Teaguish Arguments, to whipe one's Br?, VVould turn Men's stomachs, worse than the K?S?. Since in low Fawning thou do'st so delight, Art siding still with Power against Right, And, like a Turk, success in Peace, or VVar, To all the Moral vertues do'st prefer, As the worst Curse we can wish England's Foe, May'st thou at last truly a Papist grow; So many Heav'n's wrath confound thy servile Brain, Thou may'st in Earnest all their Trash maintain, Damn'd to believe what now thou do'st but feign? Since on Rome's Truth thou wou'd'st have all relye, That be thy Comfort, when thou com'st to dye; VVhen all the Terrors of grim Death attend thee, Have not one vertuous Action to befriend thee; No, in the Church's Pale think thy self safer, And find no God to save thee, but her VVafer; For thy past Life full of a just Confusion, And given over to a strong Delusion, Put thy sole Trust in a Priest's Absolution; Let his vain Unction, on thy outward skin, Be thought to heal thy ulcerous Soul within; Take't for the Balm which Gilead did afford, And have no hope of Heaven, but his word. A Short Letany. To the Tune of Cook Lawrel. I From an old Inquisition and new Declaration, From Freedom of Conscience and Whig-Toleration, 'Gainst Conscience imposing upon the whole Nation, For ever, Good Lord, deliver me! II From Knaves wou'd set up a Dispensative Power, To pull down the Test, to which we have swore, By imposing a greater than any before, For ever, &amp;c. III From the Courts Triumvirate Counsel in vain, The Father Confessor, that Cheater of Men, The Hypocrite Lobb, and the Jesuit Pen, For ever, &amp;c. IV From losing the Set in a Passion and Flame, By taking seven Men up, and hoping the same, To recover by playing an After-back-game, For ever, &amp;c. V From a Schismatick State and a Catholick Court, From picking a Jury in hopes to be for't, By Lopping the Bishops the Church to support, For ever, &amp;c. VI From a Puritans Malice and a Jesuits Spite, From shewing our Teeth without Pow'r to bite, Against our own Conscience from doing of Right, For ever, &amp;c. VII From making a Pannel the Prelates to blast, In hopes with St. Peter their Lordships to cast, And finding it all Ignoramus at last, For ever, &amp;c. Popish Politicks Unmaskt. Walking (some ten years since) along the Park, One Summer Eve, before it was quite dark; I fancyed 'mongst a Grove of Trees I spy'd A Man stand musing by the Water side: I wish 'twas but a Fancy, but I doubt You'll find it none when you have heard it out. This Person was a very tall black Man, Above the common size almost a Span, His Face was wasted in most piteous sort, In all things else he was of Royal Port: But if grim-looks alone Majestick be, Commend me to that Face for Majesty, For such it had enough for two or three. To this Tall Man joyn'd instantly another Of near his Stature, whom he called Brother, Richly incircled with a numerous Ring, Which shew'd he wanted nought but Name of King; Some time they silent were, till all were gon; Then did the Taller say, Brother go on, Which thus he did— I shall, Great Sir, my last Discourse retrieve, I pray you Good Attention to it give; Your Case peculiar is, peculiar too Must be your Care, or you your self undo; For Stations high, with Industry and Wit, A second way may find, if first don't hit: But Princes mounted on a Sovereign Throne, Nor have, nor can have other way but one, To curb the saucy Vulgar, and pull down Their Cobweb Rights that circumscribe the Crown. Tear off your Shackles, make the Bumpkins know There's none but you Almighty here below. You spoil your Game, Sir, while you do thus dally; Who follows him that standeth, shall I, shall I? You Cow the Bold, and Keen the Cowards Heart, Whilst you, divided, act the doubtful part. Had you, when London was in Flames, but run And cut the Cits damn'd Throats, your work you'd done, You should have made their Blood the Fire to meet, With Bodies fed the Flames in every Street. To do and undo, suits well with sorry things, But 'is beneath the Majesty of Kings: Cæsar, or Nothing's writ on all they do; For Monarchs know no Medium 'twixt these two. What is't you stick at, Sir? would you retreat? Y' are now so far engaged you must beat, Or beaten be, ride or be ridden now; He never back must look that holds the Plow. It may be you not Promise break, nor Oath; Pish! All the World well know you can do both. With great Advice the other day you said, By Parliaments and Counsels you'd be sway'd: To day you think it good to let them know What e're you said, you ne're intended so: Fools to their Word, but Princes great, like you, To nought but their Intentions must be true. What! Is't the Laws you tender are to break? It's well known that's a Scruple but too weak; For Laws are nothing else but Ties and Bands, On purpose made to shackle Subjects Hands. Or, of fit Tool, is't you so doubtful are? If that be it, I'll ease you of your Care; I Villains of Intrinsick value have, And more obedient than a Turkish Slave: If you but bid them thrust their bloody Knives Into their Fathers Throats, their Childrens, Wives, Or any but their own, they'l freely do't, And lay them sprawling at your Sacred Foot. I have my Teagues and Tories at my beck Will wring their Heads off like a Chickens Neck; Try'd Rogues, that never will so much as start To tear from Mothers Belly Infants Heart; First Rape, then rip them up, in one half hour Two Lusts they'l satiate, do but give them power. Faint Rogues will melt, and have their qualms of fear At Fathers Groans, or at a Mothers Tear; But mine are Monsters, fit for any Prince, Not plagu'd with Conscience, nor yet plagu'd with Sense. The Flames of Hell, Horror, eternal Pains, The Clergy's Cheats to propagate their Gains; They ridicule and scorn to lend their Ear; Let Knaves for Profit preach, and Fools go hear The Tales of future Bliss, not worth a Rush. With them one Bird in Hand's worth two i'th' Bush. Others won't serve you but on constant Pay, My Hounds will hunt, and live upon their Prey: A Virgins Haunch, or well-bak'd Ladies Breast To them is better than a Venson Feast: Babes Petticoats, cut large with Arms and Leggs, They far prefer 'fore Pettitoes of Pigs: Poor Span-long Infants, that like Carps, well stew'd In their own Blood, their Irish Chaps have chew'd; And Fathers Cauls have Candles made, to light Those black inhumane Banquets of the Night. What e're you'd have, what e're your wishes crave, Nod, and 'tis done by my obedient Slaves. They know no Scruple, no Command dispute, But do't as readily as Turkish Mute. You see, Sir, where you are, your Royal Date Grows out, if you don't soon support your Fate. To shak off Parliaments will be too great, And put you in too violent a Sweat; To baffle therefore, but not cast them off, To hold them still, but hold them still in Scoff, Must be your work; for we are weakned so, That we must drive the Nail that now will go: And that too we must do with gentle hand, That tho' they sit, they may not understand. When January comes, cold and ill way VVill call it Love to put them off till May; In May some odd Intelligence comes newly VVon't suffer you to hold them until July; And July so with heat and sickness vext, Pity Prorogues them to November next. And time is ill spent, if before that day VVe be not able to throw Mask away. This far exceeds Dissolving in my Mind, And gives to our Design a better Blind; For if two Parliaments you slight, I doubt The Rogues will then begin to scent us out; For (watchful, with Erected Ears) the Herd Stand listning now concern'd, and much afear'd; A Covey, half o're-spread, half scap'd the Net, Are always harder than at first to set: So People slipt out of the Noose or Train, Are much the harder to be catcht again. VVith Prorogations therefore short and soft They must be treated; these repeated oft VVill chafe them so, that either mad with rage, They'll bring their old Rebellion on the Stage, Or sullen sit, and leer on what we do, (The far more dangerous humour of the two) Their dogged Nature now its Venom vents In choosing damn'd and plaguy Parliaments: Poor Fools, their Rage does quite out-run their VVit, Yet you must never suffer them to sit, But mock the Choice, and mock the Session too. Another way, Sir, we our work will do; One Plot is better than ten Parliaments, Those give you Taxes, these shall give you Rents; A Thousand of the Richest we will scrue Into a Plot they ne'r heard of, nor knew. If Rents 3000 l. a Day, won't do, I'le three times three, by this Plot help you to. This, Sir's, your business, and look to your Stuff, Is all your care, for we have Rogues enough; Do you but Judges get, I'le Juries find; Witnesses too, according to our mind, Such Spruce Rogues, ah! 'twould do you good to hear How daring bold, and bravely they will Swear; They're not like Bedlow, Dugdale, Oates, and such, Consider first, for fear to speak too much, Nor let their Conscience maim their Evidence, Through tender fear of hurting Innocence: Nor do I care for a Phanatick Noose, All are Phanaticks that have ought to lose. Judge, Witnesses, and Jury, I'le make sure, The Devil's in't if all ben't then secure. Yet if this fails, don't you discourag'd be, To form new Plots, leave to my Priests and me; Like Pins one Plot another shall drive out, Till we have brought our only Plot about. Our first work is to save our Friends, that done, Like shirts t'our backs, we'll have more Plots than one; As fast as this fails, t'other we will start, Till Plot, like Pox has seiz'd on every part. They fain would foil our Plots, and fill your Ears With Regicide intents to raise your fears, This fruitless Gun, that Dagger stabs your Belly, When you know all, better than they can tell ye. Go on, Sir, never fear the heedless Herd, They have no Courage but when you're afear'd: On me lay all the faults of Town and Age, I'le safely screen you from the Peoples Rage; For when ill Accidents our Plots do spoil Me they'l call Rogue, but you most sacred stile: For Loyalty aws them in every thing, Tho' you destroy them, yet, God save the King. Tho' you them stab and I but hold the Knife, Yet still they'l wish your Majesty long life. Thus, great Sir, you're the greatest Prince alive; If Plots according to our projects thrive; And thrive they shall, if you'l but do your part, And from proposed methods never start: For Plots like Clock-work are; one Pin pull'd out Doth all its Order, and its Beauty rout, Steady your hand, keep Parliaments at Bay, Nor off, nor on, nor VVorking, nor at Play, Clip every Tongue you find does hang too long, ('Tis taking wind makes every thing scent strong.) Thus if you do, ill fortune I'le defie, All other things pray leave to Fate and I: And now adieu, I'le dive beneath the show, And act my Popish VVill by Art below. He being gone, in steps a certain Lord, VVho had of all was said heard every VVord. Great Sir (said he) who can tell what to say? If you by Popish Councils mean to sway, Curs'd be those Councils! and the Men that do Perswade you to our Ruine, and yours too. A Thousand Names, Ten Thousand let your Brother In's next Book write, if he dare write another: Ten Gentrys Names for one that he hath got, Nay let him name us all in the next Plot. All but the Papists Sir,—all but a few Of Rome's sworn Vassals and her Clergy Crew. Bate but this sort, and then take you the Pole, You'll hardly get another English Soul. Assoon as will then let your Brother draw High'r Huffs, yet he shall never England awe, On our side stand the People, and the Law: For don't mistake, Sir, 'tis by Law alone: Your Right's derived to our English Throne, Set that aside, and make the Law a sham, No Soveraign you, nor I a Subject am; For that same Law that gives you Dignity, Gives me my Life, Fortune and Liberty: Pardon, if with less reverence this is said, Than doth become a Member to its Head; For it sound Doctrine is, tho' Cully Brother And Popishs VVits would fain find out another. VVithin the Circle of the Law; great Sir, I stand, and out of it I'le never stir: If to be King you be content, I will Pay all Allegiance and Obedience still; The Peoples Rights, and all our English Laws Do make the strongest side the Subjects Cause. Nor can your keeping us from Parliaments E're futher or advantage your Intents, Far greater are the Choosers than the Choice, England's Free-holders have a mighty voice; These we'l unite, these we'l associate, And if we can't defend our Lives and Fate We'l fairly fall, and Freemen to our Graves, VVe'l rather choose to go, than to be Slaves: Our Ancesters shan't Curse us in their Tomb, Nor shall our Children in their Mothers VVomb They left us Free, and we ours Free will leave. Or Death, our Hopes and Us shall both deceive. Thus said—with angry looks He went his way No answer from his greatness could I pray; Then I trudg'd too; for vain it was to stay. On Easter-day 87. this was found fixed on the King's Chappel Door. When God Almighty had his Palace fram'd, That Glorious shining Place he Heaven Nam'd; And when the first Rebellious Angels fell, He Doom'd them to a certain place, call'd Hell. Here's Heaven and Hell confirm'd by Sacred Story, But yet I ne'er could read of Purgatory, That cleansing place which of late years is found, For sinning Souls to Flux in till they're sound: The Priest form'd that for the good Roman Race, Our Maker never thought of such a place. Oh Rome! wee'l own thee for a Learn'd wise Nation, To add a place wanting in Gods Creation. Vpon K. J. Pistolling a Mastiff Dog at Banbury, in his last Progress. The Poets tell us idle Tales to please us, Of mighty Perseus, Hercules, and Theseus; And several other gallant Heroes too, Who ev'ry one their several Monsters slew. The Minotaur did Theseus bravely slaughter, And then as bravely Sw?d the Kings own Daughter. Nemean Lion bold Hercules did choak, And of his Skin made him a lasting Cloak. The far-fam'd Perseus kill'd a mighty Whale, And all t'enjoy Andromeda's brown Tail. Historians all the great St. George admire, For murdering horrid Dragon that spit Fire. But what concerns us yet far more to tell, One of these Heroes slew the Dog of Hell; Renown'd Attempts (you'll all confess) if true, But our great J?s did more than this, (Morbleau:) He who before, t'immortalize his Name, Lost dreaded England all her Naval Fame; He who return'd from Belgick Lions Roar, When Sandwich sunk in sight of Southwold Shore; He who two Summers but of late sat down With all his Forces before Hounslow Town, And nothing else but bare dishonour won; He, when he saw his Loving Friend assail'd By furious Mastiff Cur, Ear-snip'd, bob-tail'd, Eyes darting Fire, and with his Boo-woo's fierce, Ready to seize the Lord Lieutenants Horse: 'Tis true, quoth he, to shew that wondrous Might, Which I have long conceal'd from human sight: With furious Tone pursuing then his Speech, Fanatick Dog, forbear my Royal Breech, (He cry'd) For know thou art but bluntly pointed, Tho sharp thy Fangs, to touch the Lords Anointed. To which the Dog, who never Scripture read, And scorn'd to call an Earthly Monarch Dread. I am no Dog (quoth he) to fawn and flatter, But I address according to my Nature: However know I am a Dog of Sense, That's more than may be said of many a Prince. With this the mighty J? a Pistol drew, Discharg'd, and shot the Mastiff thro' and thro: Some say that, Vulcan-like, he riv'd his Brain, No matter which, the Dog receiv'd his Bane, By Royal Hand for saucy Language slain, And both got Honour, Dog and Sovereign; The Sov'reign had the Honour Dog to kill; The Mastiff, that a Prince his Gore did spill. Now then, come down from Heaven (ye Cur) come down, Thou whom the sweltry Summers so renown; Resign that Place of thine more justly due To this same Dog, whom God's Vice-gerent slew: Surely a Dog so dignify'd in Story, Is th'only Dog worth Constellations Glory. And you, who in your Signs St. George advance, Trampling o're Dragon's Jaws peirc'd thro' with Lance, Alter your painting, and set up in place, The bravest Hero of the Scotish Race, Discharging Thunder from his gaudy Saddle, And Mastiff-prostrate in a goary Puddle: So shall you Truth advance o're Fabulous Toyes, And Dog and Monarch both Immortalize. To the Observator. Hast thou no Friend so kind, to let thee know (But thou (lost Wretch) hast neither Friend nor Foe) That thy insipid Libel's nauseous grown, No Man will read, or any Party own: Despis'd by all, who have the least pretence To Wit, to Business, Learning, or good Sense; That every little Fool does thee deride, And ev'n the Clergy have forsook their Guide. Canst thou no new, no fresh Diversion bring, But ever fiddle on the self-same string? A solemn Blockhead, or brisk old Buffoon, After the Rates of Influence from the Moon. Tho Mischief dwells in thy felonious VVill, The Pow'r is wanting, and thou'rt harmless still: Thou art an impotent, well-wishing Slave, But Nature made the Fool outweigh the Knave. Thou shift'st thy Sails, and changest every side, Art ever labouring to save thy Tide. In vain thy dulness throws thee still behind, VVhile nimbler Knaves laugh, and thy Prizes find: Contemn'd by all, of all Recourse bereft, Thou leav'st old Friends, and by the new are left. But since 'twere vain th'abandon'd to advise, And bid a positive old Fool be wise: VVere I to answer the Fop Observator, I'd wipe—with his Works, piss on their Author. Old Gammer Cook. As Mother Cook went t'other day To do the Deed of Nature, VVhat lay in the way, instead of Hay, But reverend Observator? She took it up, and read a Scrap: Alas! (quoth she) 'tis pity That Nock shou'd ever have a wipe VVith Pamphlateer so witty! O ingrateful world! must this learn'd Sire Be dawb'd, to save our Fingers, The bawling, Ballad-making-Squire, That makes such work for Singers? VVas Towzer and Fidlerio too, VVhip-Cat, and Antipendium, Inferiour Clergy's Guide, I tro, That strikes Dissenting Men dumb? He whips VVhig-Conventicle Doggs, And Jears old Fox's Martyrs, He whips the Sister-Saints, and flogs Susanna's Bouncing Daughters. Thus far she trumpeted his Praise, And (squitter squatter) guilt his Bays. The Drinking Song. Give us Musick with VVine, And we'll never repine At prosperous Knaves, but defy 'em; Those Politick Sots Are still weaving of Plots, So sine, that at last they fall by 'em. VVe Laugh and we Drink, And on business ne'r think, Our Voices and Hautboys still sounding; VVhile we dance, play, and sing, VVe've the world in a string, And our pleasure is ever abounding. Your sober dull Knave, For VVise is but Grave, 'Tis Craft, and not VVisdom, employs him: VVe nothing Design But good Musick and VVine, And blessed is he that enjoys them. A Dialogue between Father Petre and the Devil. F. P. Oh, are you come? 'Tis more than time; Your Tardiness is no small Crime; All our Designs are at a stand, They've got again the upper hand; Yet like true Jesuite, I have wrought My Charge up to the Point I sought, Both Sense and Reason quite or'ethrown, For those we deal with must have none. D. Is this a Conquest to relate, Worthy a Jesuitic Pate? I have more Trouble with you had, Than all the Orders I have made: Beside, I joyn'd in the Design One, whose fell Malice equals mine; One so ambitiously inclin'd, Of such an uncontrouled Mind, That, let the Gulph be ne're so deep, Or Pyramids prodigious steep; If in th'Extreams thou can'st disclose Any that does her Will oppose; (Tho' on just Grounds) they meet their Fate In violent—unbounded Hate. F. P. I did not call you to discourse, We must do something now by Force: Our whole Society is sham'd, And we in our first Founder damn'd. Did I, tho' to my Souls Perdition, Add things more black than my Commission, Gaining Belief among the Great, Who forc'd upon themselves the Cheat? While the good Man I kept at th'Oar, No Gally Slave e're labour'd more; Nor durst I let him pause upon't, Lest, if he thought he shou'd recant; With puzzling Notions still possess'd him, At once tormented and caress't him; Hood-wink'd the Pilot that shou'd steer us, With our infallible Chimeras. D. Boast not as if you'd Conquest won, You've started much, and nothing done; Your Order, wheresoe're they came, Have set whole Kingdoms in a Flame: Nor Hell, nor Rome, can give you thanks For acting thus a mad Man's Pranks. Did I not always to you preach, The English wou'd you over-reach? They'l be convinc'd e're they believe, Not pin their Faith upon your Sleeve; Your publick Chappels have o'rthrown us, Our very Proselytes disown us; And face about to th'other Side, Exclaiming 'gainst the Roman Pride. F. P. What, do you now complain of me, For over-acting Villany? I still consulted you in all, Did daily for your Conduct call: And tho', 'tis true, I nam'd the Saints, Yet 'twas to you I made my Plaints. I own, about the French we fail'd, But in the Irish we prevail'd: Propose once more, and I'l obey't, It shall be done if you but say't: You know, in such a holy Juggle, My seared Conscience ne'r did boggle: We must not flag, or sit down here, That wou'd declare Remorse or Fear, Which Jesuits do more decline, Than e're the Rechabites did Wine. But I have something to impart, Which does oppress my tender Heart, And made me now invoke you hither, Tho' 'gainst your Principles, to gather The truth of some important Queres Most needful in this dubious Series. First, if it in you Pow'r does lye, Tell me what Death I'm doom'd to dye: I dare not hope 't must be in Bed, That suits not with the Life I led: But if I must be hang'd and quarter'd, Let me be canoniz'd and martyr'd, With holy Harcourt, and his Fellows, Like them be Sainted at the Gallows. The next thing I desire to learn, (If you the Secret can discern, If Truth does in your Bosom lye, Which were indeed a Mystery.) Let me in private understand, Both when, and where, the Dutch will Land. And last, I do this Favour crave, Since I have ever been your Slave; Unfold the mystic Book of Fate, And read me England's future State, Who next shall to the Throne succeed, The English or Italian Breed. The Devil answering, laugh'd outright: Wou'd I these Secrets bring to light, I shou'd not half that Harvest gain, For which I've taken all this Pain: Nor wou'd I, if I cou'd, reveal That which my Interest bids conceal. Yet I will answer thee in part, Since I've an Interest in thine Heart; The first, peculiar is to thee, For which thou need'st not trouble me, 'Tis what thy self did long foresee. Nor is it reason to believe Thou shou'd'st the Mobile deceive: But whether Martyr, or a Traytor, Thy Ballad will be Truth's Relator, The other two will be made plain, When Belgic Lions cross the Mane. This said, the Devil left the Father, The Meaning of his VVords to gather, And vanish'd from him down the Stairs, VVhile he proceeded in his Pray'rs. The Metamorphosis. Had the late fam'd Lord Rochester surviv'd, VVe'd been inform'd who all our Plots contriv'd; Authors and Actors we had long since seen, In sharpest Satyrs they'd recorded been, Tho' Captain, Doctor, Lord, Duke, K??g, or Queen: His bold and daring Muse had soar'd on high, And brought down true Intelligence from the Sky. He oft the Court has of its Vices told, VVhile Priests pretend they dare not be so bold; Tho' they're Heav'n's Messengers, it's Livery wear Receive it's bounteous Salary, yet they dare, Neglect their Duty, or for Gain or Fear: Connive at what's directly opposite, And, e're they'l give Offence, each turn a Proselyte: VVitness the dismal Change that now is come, Long since expected by the Church of Rome. The Calves of Dan and Bethel bleat aloud, And Jeroboam worships in the Crowd; Our Upstart Statesmen turn with every VVind, That blows from Rome, to Sense and Truth are blind. But yet, tho' ten of our twelve Tribes shou'd fall, And worship Dagon, Ashtaroth, and Baal; A Remnant will remain, who firm will stand, To God, Religion, and their Native Land; VVho will not bow themselves to th'Romish Yoke, Tho' they share Sydney's or brave Russel's Stroke Nor can this Egypt's Darkness long remain, A Star of Jesse will shine out again; Scotch Vermine, Irish Frogs, French Locusts; All That swarm both at Saint James's and Whitehall; Tho' now advanc'd to all Trust, all Command, All Offices enjoy by Sea and Land, Shall, when this Sun doth set, no more appear Within the Confines of our Hemisphere. A Princely Branch remains will on us smile, And spread its goodly Boughs quite o're the Isle; Confirm our staggering Hopes, remove our Fears, And turn to Balm of Gilead all our Tears; The Church and State shall nourish as before, Just Judges to the needful Bench restore; And throughly purge the Judgment-Seat from those Who make the Laws themselves the Laws Oppose. For such there are, and in the highest Place, VVho their Profession do so much disgrace; That many fear their Grievance to unfold, Where Law and Conscience both are bought and sold. Our Pulpits too shall be adorn'd with those VVho turn not with each Blast of VVind that blows; VVho dare preach Truth, and dare that Truth maintain, Not mov'd by Threatnings, Frowns, Favor, or Gain; That dare declaim against the Sins o'th Nation, VVhile others of that Tribe embrace the Fashion. Nor thenceforth shall those Black Coat-Vipers come, VVho here are daily disembogu'd from Rome; VVhere Sins of all Kinds, and of all Degrees, (The Church Revenues, and the Office Fees Being discharg'd) Religiously are done, Tho' 't be to murther Father, Brother, Son; Ravish a Sister, with a Daughter do VVhat Nature has a just Abhorrence to; For which, if Purgatory or Hell you shun, Fee the Priests largely, and your Work is done; They're Delegates to him that keeps the Keys, And can't admit one Soul without the Fees; For he, as God, in Heaven and Earth has Pow'r To Crown and to Uncrown in the same Hour; Unmake and Make, Create and Uncreate, To Torments after Death can give a Date; From him proceeds inevitable Fate. These Imps do now in Crowds each other follow, And hope e're long Churches and Bells to hallow; To teach you how to worship to the East, Prescribe us Fasts, while they themselves do Feast; Whole Loads of Reliques they have got together, Ay, and Saint Peter's Shadow's gliding hither; In th'Abbey shortly will be kept a Fair, Where you may buy such consecrated Ware, As England has not seen this hundred Year. For 'tis not France, nor Italy, nor Spain, That can the thousandth Part of Saints contain; For Saints, by Canonizing, do become, By an infallible Deception made at Rome, Not only Omnipresent, but beside, One into twenty thousand they divide: The like with other Reliques they can do, Joseph's old Coat, the Virgin Mary's Shoe; Saint Peter's Sword, that cut off Malchus Ear; The Hoofs o'th' silly Ass which Christ did bear; The Right Eye of John Baptist, and the Apostle St. Thomas's Shoulder Blade-Bone, with the Gristle; The Virgin Mary's Milk, sold by the Quart; Nay, th'Blood and Water, which from Jesu's Heart Was by a Souldier let out with a Spear, By Miracle kept 'bove sixteen hundred year: Besides all this, more Nails to shew there be, That fix'd our Saviour Christ unto the Tree; Than twenty Smiths in a whole Day can make; Yet all these for the same the Church does take. Bless me, thought I, good Heaven! What does this mean? Such Trumpery by me shall ne'r be seen; No, nor the Monsters, that were nam'd before, Altho' a Trumpet stood before the Door, And, after dismal Sound on Ludgate-Hill, VVhere Porcupine of you did cast his Quill; VVhere Crocodile, Rhinoceros, and Baboon, VVith other Prodigies are daily show'n; Invite me in, I wou'd not stir I swear, To see those more Prodigious—there. Cæsar's Ghost. 'Tvvas still low Ebb of Night, when not a Star Was twinkling in the muffled Hemispere; But all around in horrid Darkness mourn'd, As if old Chaos were again return'd; When not one Gleam of the eternal Light Shot thro' the solid Darkness of the Night; In dismal Silence Nature seem'd to sleep, And all the Winds were buried in the Deep; No whispering Zephyrus aloft did blow, Nor warring Boughs were murmuring below; No falling Waters dash'd, no Rivers purl'd; But all conspir'd to hush the drowsie World. When on my Couch in thoughtless Slumbers wrapt I lay repos'd;—My very Soul too slept In peaceful Dulness, silent and serene, Till 'twas debauch'd and waken'd into Dream. Methought I saw a dark and dismal Vault, Whose Horror cannot be conceiv'd by Thought, And seem'd by some Infernal Magick wrought: So vast, and so perplexing intricate, As if the dreadful Court of Death and Fate; And yet of Kings the great Repositer, And only Royal Dust lyes mouldering here. Amongst these Monuments of Sacred Fame, Great Cæsar stood; Cæsar, whose deathless Name, When Shrines decay, triumphant shall remain, While Sense, good Nature, Wit, and Love shall reign. VVhile I with awful Fear and Trembling paid Humble Oblations to the mighty Dead, Methought the sweating Marble did unclose, And from Death's Mansion the dead Monarch rose; His Eyes o're all scatter'd a sullen Light, Such as divides the breaking Day from Night; By whose faint Rays the Object I discern'd All pale—with ghastly Majesty adorn'd. His stiffen'd Loyns a purple Mantle bore, His Brows a VVreath of wither'd Lawrels wore, Such as had flourish'd there in Life before. Now forth he stalks, silent as Shadows glide, Or Clouds that skim the Air while they divide, As quick as thought the faithless Town he pass't, And towards the Camp of wonderous Fame does hast, VVhile Midnight Fogs surround his awful Head, And down his Locks their baneful Poyson shed; The wandring airy Demons at the View, And all the Ignis Fatuus's withdrew; Hecate let fall, her charm-preparing Weeds, Wondring what unknown Pow'r Earth's Surface treads, Which more than that which she invokes, she dreads. She flies all frighted with erected Hair, And scarce her Broomstaff bears her thro' the Air; From his dread Presence every Evil ran, Except that more exalted Evil, Man: Not the first Race of less corrupted Fiends, Till taught by Man, knew half their new-coin'd Sins. Thrice with Majestick Pace he walks the round Surveying the Pavilions utmost bound, And useless Grandeur every where he found. Philippi, nor the fam'd Pharsalian Field, Did not more Signs of Glorious Action yield; But this was all for show not Terror made, 'Twas Hounslow Farce, a Siege in Masquerade. More near he views it yet, and found within, All the Degrees of Luxury and Sin; Alsatia's Sink into this Common-Shore, Did all its vile and nasty Nusance pour; Fat Sharpers, Broken Cuckolds, Gamesters, Cheats, What Newgate disembogues find here Retreats; The Groom and Footman from their Livery stript, With Scarf, Gay Feather, and Command equipt. Promotion gives to Sauciness Pretence, And greatness is mistook for Insolence; And to evince their Valour every Hour Bamboo the Slaves that bow beneath their Pow'r; Yet to the Countrey Ladies these appear So Novel, witty, beau, en Cavalier, That scarce a tender Heart is left behind, Pray God a Maidenhead you chance to find! The Phantom to that Quarter first resorts, Where the Illustrious Generals keep their Courts. I. Great F? the Foremost of the Crew, Whose Uncle Tureign well cou'd fight we know. He who so often do's repeat the Jest How he subdu'd the Monarch of the West, (Or wou'd have done had he not been undrest.) This rough stern Hero of the British War To Neighbouring Tents is always born in Chair, For fear of Incommodement from the Air. II. It wonders what did C?ll recommend, VVho never did to Deeds of Arms pretend: Love, all his Active Youth, his business was, Love that best suits his handsom Shape and Face. But Armies are like Verse, whose Dogrel Lines Are here for Sense, and there for gingling Rhimes. (Here where Bellona lays her Armour by, And learns to be more charming Company, VVhere the ill-manner'd God has nought to do:) Some few for fighting are, but most for show; VVhere rich embroidered Cloaks a la Campagne So often shine, unless it chance to rain. Then Lord, how the Sir M. will fret and fling! Undone, 'tis spoil'd, e're shown before the King; In perfum'd Beds adorn'd they're basking laid, As fine as young Brides, on Persian Carpets tread, That o're the spacious Floor in wanton Pride are spread, Like Feasting Gods luxurious, and, they say, As arrant Fornicators too as they. None come amiss when Lust their Fancies lead, Alcmena, nor the sweet-fac'd Ganimede; And, like those Gods, they all are given to Love, But none we hear e're thunder'd but old Jove. III. Here one the Hero acts in Lovit's Arms, And calls his Passion out in warlike Terms, Tells of soft Sieges, Batteries and Alarms; How the Artillery of her Eyes did wound, And how at the first Onset he gave ground: He who ne're yet did to a Conqueror bow, Yet kisses and adores his Fetters now; VVhile all the Batteeies ever he essay'd, Have been against some Female Fortless Maid; But Love-it, who has less of Love than Pride, Being with guilt Coach and Country-house supply'd, Makes that attone for all Defects beside. IV. There lay a Youth of all his VVits bereft, Who this Campaign was by his Mistress left; A nauseous Strumpet, insolent and loud, False and destructive, basely born and proud. Oh bubbl'd Fool, thou that hadst seen the Fate Of Cully-B???shes quietly spent Estate: Collier undon, and forty Rake-hells more For an old common o're-grown flabby VVhore, Whose Bastard Son may vie with thee for Age, A Trader twenty years upon the Stage: What from th'expensive Folly couldst thou see, But shameful Ruine, laught-at Infamy? Thy Eyes, I know, were open'd long before, But still the Jilt betray'd thee to the VVhore; Debas'd thy Noble Spirits to her Rule, And turn'd thy once fair Fame to Ridicule, Debauch'd thy Sense with Conversation base, Whores, Eating Pimps, Players, a numerous Race, While thou the treating Cully art despis'd, And Cuckold by the Slaves thou Gormandiz'd. Return, thou Prodigal, from Husks and Swine, The Ruine of the first, was cause of thine: They say thou'rt brave, give us this Proof of it, And we'll believe thou can'st be braver yet: Thou'st yet a Nobler Race of Life to run, Leave Herwood to her now to be undone: But her kind Keeper gone, his Flame will fade; Love cools when 'tis an Obligation made. V. Here an old batter'd Tangieren he beheld, More mawl'd by Love than e're he was in Field; Yet wondrous Amorous still, and wondrous gay, Old January dizen'd up in May; His Zeals as Trophies of his Victory Graces, But all adorn'd with many Looking-glasses, Col. Sachvil. In which he practises Bon Mein and Faces; How well to manage Ogling, and what Air He shou'd maintain, when cock, when frisk his Hair; What Affectation best wou'd Youth express, And least the Ruines of his Age confess; Half-choak'd with monstrous Crevat-string, Disputes What Colour best to his Complection suits; And all in Middle Gallery to pore, And claim which is his Joy, some low-priz'd Whore Vain self-admiring Fop, tho every day Thou dost thy antiquated Form survey! But to be well deceiv'd, cease playing the Ass Six hours each Morning before a Looking-glass, And trust the wiser Valet with thy Dress; For whilst thou dost not that ag'd Face behold, Thy Dress may flatter thee, thou art not old. 6. Chett, that Scundrel, he whom Nature made An arrant Fool, although a Rogue by Trade, Which he industriously improv'd so well, He does in nicest Villany excel, And from the Trumpet rais'd the Colonel; Yet lives a double Scandal in his Race, His Morals are as odious as his Face: Tho Knave and Coward in his Front be writ, He has one Vertue recommends him yet; A Passive Valour that can kicking bear, A Caution that secur'd him in his Fear Behind the Canon in the Western War. And farther to this Honour has Pretence, Can cheat his Men with matchless Impudence: But that's the general Cry, While no bold Tongue Is found to tell Augustus of their wrong. VII. Next a Grabesious Allonier, who sat Like Bacchus on his Tun in drunken state, With all his mellow Gang encompass'd round, In high Debauch of Wine and Bawdry drown'd. VIII. That Monster G?dy of prodigious size, A Body fitted to his beastly Vice; A Face to all more formidable far Than Gorgon's Head, or to that Coward Warr; In youth mean Cheats and Rooking was his Trade, Now (starving) got Command—for Drink—not Bread. IX. V? our new Troy's Hector, and it's hope, Preferr'd from Tail of Coach to Head of Troop; 'Twas no true Valour got him first a Name, But some Welsh Fury did his Blood inflame, And sure he never fought when he was tane. No Brutal Coward Tyrant Algerien E're healed Slaves so ill as his have been; As if to him Authority were new, It is but damn the Rascal, and a Blow. For they so oft false Musters we observe, Rather than follow him the Rogues will starve; And wou'd, if e're indeed there came a War Be justly shot like wry-neck'd Chevalier, By some of his own Soldiers in the Reer. But V?n's not alone, more of his stamp, That better merit Tyburn, rule the Camp. X. Among this Crew M?ll that Fornicator, Incamp'd with Grandam Doxy and her Daughter; The good old Soul he loves because she's handy, Can joque and smoak, and hold him tack with Brandy; Full threescore years in wise Experience bred, Preferr'd from drawing Ale to M?ll's Bed; She's old enough to witch, and by her Art Has struck some crooked Pin quite through his Heart. Or has some damn'd Infirmity unseen, That makes him dote on such a rivell'd Queen. XI. Among this Drunken Club was Beau Sir Tom, Dub'd for his Brother's Merits, not his own; From drudging City Prig advanc'd to be Right Worshipful, in Place of High Degree, But knew not how to manage Quality. And thought the nearest way was to be lewd, While all Degrees the Debochee pursu'd; But like true Cit did always over-do, As well in Lewdness as in Fashions too; Drinking's his leading Vice, his Darling Sin, That pumps his duller Inclination in; Then loud as Storms, incourag'd for all evil, Swears and invokes by Healths his Guardian Devil. By chance the Poet Elcanah was there To make 'em sport, for 'twas not yet the Fair; VVith many more too scandalous to name, VVhose Talents are to swear, whore, drink and game; At a large Table they were seated round, VVith Bottles, Snush, foul Pipes and Glasses crown'd, Boxes and Dice—but whether false or true, I leave it to the Fools that Night shall rue; For there was Country Squire and City Cully, That came to see the Show, look'd to by Bully, VVhere bubbl'd of their Coyn, they healed are A la Campagne—that is, with Chear entire: Damme, cries Grab, each Prig his Buttork bring, And let us forthwith fall to managing; When I am boozing, clear old Dudgeon's Drolish, Then let my Natural be a Jump, a Polish, I sink her down—Then makes some nasty Jest, And Crowns it with a Bumper to the Best; (And calls for Link-boy, swears his Pego's nice, And therefore cannot deal in common Vice.) Then to the Height of Lewdness they retire, And Venus must extinguish Bacchus fire. Thus 'tis when Men forsake an honest Trade, How much a better Pedant thou hadst made; Or (bilking sharp) hadst bully'd up and down, And scar'd the Trembling Mortals of the Town? This was thy Talent, this thy proper Sphere; Yet still this Part of thee remains while here, That thou canst cheat, oppress, and domineer. Tho thus much by thy Foes must be confess'd, Of all thy roaring Tribe thou art the best. The rest such Cowards, Sots, such hard'ned Rogues, Blasphemers, Villains, Rake-hells, Swines and Dogs, Have newer Sins than were to Sodom known, And if just Heav'n shou'd send his Vengeance down, There's not one Lot to save a sinking Town. But numberless and endless 'twere to tell All the rank Vice that fills this Local Hell. All which the Phantom does in hast survey, He scents the Morning Air, and must away, And on the Eastern Hill he views the breaking day. Yet e're he goes with a Remorse extreme Looks back and sighs o're this Jerusalem; Nor cou'd depart till like the Prophet too, In whispering Our pronounc'd thrice—wo, wo, wo; And then methought I hear'd a Hollow Sound, Like Ecchoes that from Caves and Rocks rebound; And thus it spake—Full five and twenty years I Reign'd, without the Noise or Toil of Wars, Bore all th'Indignities of Factious Power, And saw my Life in danger every hour; Yet rather had resign'd it up in Peace, Than ow'd my Safety to such Brutes as these; At best a Scare-crow Rebels to affright, Put them to Action, and scarce one will fight. Ah, great Augustus! thou deserv'st an Host Of Heroes, such as ancient Rome produc'd; When each Commander should like Scipio be; Or rather like the yet more Godlike thee, Brave, Temperate, Prudent to the last degree. The common Rout all Sceva's in the Field, Who bore a thousand Arrows in his Shield. At least they shou'd have Souls to be inspir'd, And by thy great Example to be fir'd; Thy Constancy and Valour imitate, And raise at once thy Glory and the State. This said, and parting with a pittying Look, Tow'rds his Eternal Hope his way he took, And blest his Fate he cou'd again return To the blest Confines of his peaceful Urn. The Fourth Satyr of Boileau to W. K. 1687. Believe me, Will, that those who have least Sense, Think they to VVisdom have the sole Pretence; And that those VVretches who in Bethlem are, Deserve it less than those who put them there. The haughty Pedant, swoln with Frothy Name Of Learned Man, big with his Classick Fame; A thousand Books read o're and o're again, Does word for word most perfectly retain, Heap'd in the Lumber-Office of his Brain; Yet this cram'd Skull, this undigested Mass, Does very often prove an arrant Ass; Believes all Knowledge is to Books confin'd, That reading only can inform the Mind; That Sense must Err, and Reason ramble wide, If Sacred Aristotle ben't their Guide. While, on the other hand, a Flutt'ring thing, VVith a full Roll, and three pil'd Crevat string, Whose Life's a Visit, who alone takes care To say fine things, write Songs, and count the Fair; Laughs at the musty Precepts of the School, Calls the Learn'd Writer an Authentick Fool; Swears that all Learning is a thing unfit A well-bread Person, or a Man of Wit; Names proper only to the Sparks o'th' Town, And dams his Scholar to his Colledge Gown. The fierce Bigot, who vainly does believe His bantring Zeal can Heaven it self deceive; With Saint-like Looks the bleer-ey'd Crowd does blind, And the Jilt Villain damns all Human kind. While the wild Libertine, that Beast of Prey, Who bears down all that stops him in his way, Ranges o're all, and takes his savage fill In the wild Forest of a boundless will: Swears that Heaven, Jove's, and Hells Eternal Pain, Are the sick Dreams of a Distemper'd Brain, Tales fit for Children, a meer holy Jest, to starve the People, and to glut the Priest. The sharpest Satyrist with Poetick Rage Strives to reform the Vices of the Age; Laughs at the Fool, and at the Villain rails; Yet Folly reigns, and Villany prevails; VVhile the crack'd Skull shows all that has been said, Leaves Marks on nothing but the Poet's Head: For partial Man, try'd by himself alone, Protesting every Sentence but his own; Severe to all Men, to himself too kind, Sees others Faults, but to his own is blind. The sordid Miser, a meer lump of Clay, Form'd into Man e're from its gross Allay, It was refin'd by the Souls Heavenly Ray, VVhose Thirst of Wealth encreases with his Store, And to spend less, does covet to have more; VVho Midas-like, to feed his Avarice, Starves in the enjoyment of a golden wish; Thinks himself wise, boasts of being provident, And down-right Scraping calls good Management. The Love of VVealth is madness, and I hate The very trouble of a great Estate: 'Tis perfect Dirt, cries the vain Prodigal, Mad till 'tis gone, and when he has spent all, The beggar'd Fool calls himself Liberal. Now weigh them both, and tell me, if you can, VVhich of the two seems the most prudent Man: The Gamester swears both shou'd in Bethlem be, That Fortune-monger, maddest of the three, VVhose Life, whose Soul, whose very Heav'n is Play, At which the Bubble throws them all away; Who every moment waits his Destiny From the uncertain running of a Die; And, if he chance to lose, then how he stares! Then how the Fury, with his bristled Hairs Curses his Fate! Earth, hell, and Heaven defies, And with Oaths heap'd on Oaths, he storms the Skies. I could name thousands more, but to draw all The Shapes of this false Reasoning Animal, Wou'd be as hard, as to count all that die Each Spring and Fall by Low'r and Mercury: Or say how of th'impatient Heir, to have The Old Man's wealth, has wisht him in his Grave: A Drudgery so great my Pen declines, Content to sum up all in these four Lines. Greece boasts seven Sages, but the Story lies, For the whole World ne'r saw one truly VVise: All Men are Mad; and the sole Difference Lies in the More, or the Less, want of Sense. A Cawdle for a Sick Jesuit. From Rome's Infallibility take a Grain, Two Drams of Inquisition fetch from Spain; Of Dr? Honesty one Mite engage, Dr? the Glory of the British Stage! O're Flaming Coals in let 'em blow it, Till the all-conquering dissolve the Poet. Add, that the Fire and Brimstone be not dull, Two Grains of VVit drain'd from an Irish Scull, VVith Conscience galling for those senseless Gulls, To see th'untimely Fate of twenty Bulls. From Statute-Shelfs pull down the Acts, and drain The Twenty Fifth of old Queen Bess's Reign; Set those on Coals of Purgatory-Fire, The space the Devil napping catch'd the Frier; 'Twill cure all Maladies, tho conceal'd in Closet, And 'tis the true Catholic-Cordial Posset. A Congratulatory Poem on his Highness the Prince of Orange, his coming into England. Written by Mr. Thomas Shadwell. Our Glorious Realm, o're all the Earth Renown'd, Once with the Noblest Government was Crownd; By which all Foreign Tyrannies were aw'd, Easie we were at home and Terrible abroad. All our wise Laws of Empire were design'd Nor for the Lust of one, but good of all Mankind; The great Prerogative was understood A vast unbounded pow'r of doing good: From doing ill, by Laws it was confin'd; If Sanctions, Pacts, or Oaths, could Princes bind, By Ancient usages and Laws they sway'd, VVhich both were by the choice of Subjects made. Old Customs grew to Laws by long consent, And to each Written Law of Parliament: Freedom in Boroughs, and in Land Freehold; Gave all, who had them, Voices, uncontroul'd: But few new Rights were by new Laws obtain'd, Only some ravish'd liberties regain'd. Who had no Voices, yet alike were bound By the Protection, which from Law's they found, For every one in those had equal right, And no great Man could injure, or affright; Where Subjects in the Laws can claim no share. 'Twixt them and Cattel no distinctions are. This was the Constitution of our State, And true Religion flourish'd in its height: From lying Legends, false Traditions, free, From Monkish Ignorance, Schoolmens Frippery, From Idols, and from Papal Tyranny. Their building made of Stubble and of Hay, VVas by our Wise Reformers swept away; Thus we enjoy'd a happy Union, Under the great Eliza, perfect grown, Hers and the Peoples Int'rests, were thought one. She, and the Realm, with mutual kindness strove, Great its Obedience, and as great her Love; Long might such happiness have been enjoy'd, Had it not been b' Ambitious Priests destroy'd. Those haughty Priests could not contented be VVith what remain'd from Popish Dignity, But would their Hierarchy have greater made, VVith cast off Rights the Laity th'invade, And call in Jus Divinum to their aid. VVith that invisible Commission arm'd Our Kings, with Sov'raign, and Inherent charm'd, VVith Sacred Person, power without a Bound, Prerogative unlimited, no ground VVhereof is in our Constitution found. Thus they, by Ecclesiastick Flattery, Turn'd Kings to Tyrants, and to Slaves, the free; These Furious Fools yet VVise Divines contemn'd, And their rash Doctrines, privately condemn'd; None dare in publick say they were unsound, But Fines, and Pillories, and Brands, were found. For now Commission'd from above the Sky, Kings soon were deem'd for Laws, and Oaths too high; Hotly 'twas taught, they were not bound by Oaths, Because no Pow'r above them to impose. 'Twas now no Kingly Office nor a Trust, No Laws to Rule by but their Sov'raign Lust; And all the Land for their Estate they own'd, The Subjects were their Stock upon the Ground. At length, to rivet on the Chains we wore, Leud Knaves in Quoifs yield the Dispensing Pow'r, VVhich never Tyrant here had claim'd before. The Scandals of the Bar must now be found To give the Government this mortal wound; VVhich at one blow took all its strength away, And down in pieces dash'd, the Noble Structure lay. Ruine and Rubbish cover'd all the Ground, And no Remains were of the building found. Monsters of Roman and Hybernian Race, VVith Phangs and Claws infect the wasted place: VVith one of Brittish kind, who swallow'd more Than any other Bloody Beast of Pow'r; Fiercely he goggled, his Jaws open'd wide, Louder he roar'd than all the Beasts beside. Some like Jaccals, before him Prey'd for Blood, And to his Rav'nous Maw brought all they cou'd: Against the Rapine of these Beasts of Prey, First Londons Noble Prelate stood at Bay; One fit t'attone for all the Clergies Blots, For three vile English Bishops, and twelve Scots. Then Valiant Fairfax and brave Hough made head, But by these Monsters were discomfited; And now the trembling Church began to reel, And the effects of Non-resistance feel VVhere Jus Divinum was not on their side; They strove to stop the fierce impetuous Tyde. Seven Suffering Heroes gave it such a shock, It seem'd to dash its Surges on a Rock; But Show'rs of Locusts came with thickest Fogs, From Tybers Marshes and from Shanons Bogs; Vast clouds of Vermin hasten to their aid, And intercepting light thick darkness made; All clouded was our Sullen Hemisphere, But Lo! the Glorious Orange does appear! And by his Universal Influence, Does to our Drooping Land new Life dispence; His heat ferments that Lump, was dead before, VVhich now in every part exerts its Pow'r; To purge its self, that it may clean become, The Fermentation soon throws off the Scum. And ev'ry part does tow'ards Perfection move, Tow'rds Strength, and Soundness, Harmony &amp; Love: When Earth oppress'd, with darkness over-spread, From filthy Boggy exhalations bred. The Sun with noiseless Marches of his light, Discusses Vapours, and dispels the Night; With Equal Silence in his Glorious Race, Our noysome Fogs does the Brave Orange Chase: Does all the powers of Darkness put to flight, And the Infernal Ministers of Night; The Guilty Spirits shun th'approach of light. When undistinguish'd in the Mighty Mass, And in Stagnation Universal matter was; Huddled in heaps the diff'ring Attomes lay Quiet, and had no Laws of Motion to obey: Th'Eternal Mover threw the ferment in, The Solid Attoms did their Course begin; The Quickning Mass moves now in every part, And does its Plastick Faculties exert. The jarring Attomes move into a peace, And all Confusion, and Disorders cease: The Ugly undigested Lump became, The perfect Glorious, and well order'd Frame. Let there be Light, th'Almighty fiat Run, No sooner 'twas pronounc'd, but it was done: Inspir'd by Heav'n, thus the great Orange said, Let there be Liberty, and was obey'd. Vast VVonders Heav'ns great Minister h'as wrought, From our dark Chaos, beauteous Order brought: H'invaded us with Force to make us free, And in anothers Realm, could meet no Enemy. Hail Great Assertor, of the Greatest Cause; Mans Liberty, and the Almighty's Laws: Heav'n Greater VVonders has for thee design'd. Thou Glorious Deliv'rer of Mankind! A Congratulatory Poem to the most Illustrious Queen Mary, upon her Arrival in England. By Thomas Shadwell. MADAM, Immur'd with Rocks of Ice no VVretches left Hopeless of Life, of Heat and Light bereft, Under the Influence of the rugged Bear, Where but one Day and Night is all the Year, With ne'er so much transporting Joy could meet The dawning Day, as Your Approach we greet: Your Beams reviv'd us from the Belgian Shore: VVhich now our long-lov'd Princess does restore. VVhat could make us so rich? Or them so poor? The World nought equal to our Joy can find, But the despairing Grief You left behind. We from the Mighty States have now gain'd more Than by our Aid they ever got before. When the Great Vere's and Sidney's won such Fame, That each of them immortalliz'd his Name. Not Alva's Rage would have distress'd them so As, MADAM, we have done, recalling You. Our ador'd Princess to Batavians lent, Is home to us with mighty Interest sent: For we, with her, have won the Great Nassau, VVhose Sword shall keep the Papal World in awe. She comes, She comes, the Fair, the Good, the Wise, VVith loudest Acclamations rend the Skies, Rock all the Steeples, kindle ever Street, Thunder ye Cannons from each Fort and Fleet. To all the neighb'ring Lands sound out your Joys, And let France shake at the Triumphant Noise. Bless'd be the rising Waves, the murmuring Gales Sustain'd the Mighty Cargo, swell'd the Sayls. Bless'd be the Vessel, as that was which bore The Sacred Remnant, when there was no Shore. Not the returning Dove they welcom'd so As we our MARY, who brings Olive too; That only promis'd Safety to their Lives, This our lost Peace and Liberty revives. Bless'd, bless'd be his Invasion, which made way For this most happy and Illustrious Day. So brave an Action, so Renown'd a Name, Was ne'er yet written in the Book of Fame. Let Parasites call Princes Wise, and Brave, Who bear inglorious Arms but to inslave. Our Prince will break those Chains wherewith they bind: 'Tis his true Glory to enlarge Mankind. In any Land You would Dominion gain; And MADAM, in each Common-Wealth would Reign. VVhere'er your God-like PRINCE from us should go They would like us, submit without a Blow. In his short Sway more Wisdom He has shown, Than here before in Ages has been known. The Name of KING adds nothing to his Fame; But his great Virtues dignifie that Name. VVhat Land can boast of such a matchless Pair, Like him so wise, so brave; like You so wise, so fair? VVhere e're so many sacred Virtues joyn, They to a Scepter shew a Right Divine. Who are approv'd so Valiant, Wise and Just, Have the best Titles to the highest Trust, Though from the Loins of greatest Kings deriv'd, That Title's not so strong, nor so long liv'd; For Princes more of solid Glory gain, Who are thought fit, than who are born to Reign. Ode on the Anniversary of the King's Birth. By Thomas Shadwell. Welcome, thrice welcome, this Auspicious Morn, On which the Great Nassau was Born, Sprung from a mighty Race, which was design'd For the Deliv'rers of Mankind. Illustrious Heroes, whose prevailing Fates Rais'd the Distress'd, to High and Mighty States; And did by that possess more true Renown, Than their Adolphus gain'd by the Imperial Crown. They cool'd the Rage, humbled the Pride of Spain, But since the Insolence of France no less, Had brought the States into Distress, But that a precious Scien did remain From that Great Root, which did the shock sustain, And made them High and Mighty once again. This Prince for us, was Born to make us free From the most abject Slavery. Thou hast restor'd our Laws their Force again; VVe still shall Conquer on the Land by thee; By thee shall Triumph on the Main. But thee a Fate much more sublime attends, Europe for Freedom on thy Sword depends; And thy Victorious Arms shall tumble down The Savage Monster from the Gallick Throne: To this Important Day, we all shall owe, Oh Glorious Birth, from which such blest effects shall flow. On this glad Day let every Voice, And Instrument, Proclaim our Joys, And let all Europe joyn in the Triumphant Noise. Io Triumphe let us Sing, Io Triumphe let us Sing, And let the Sound through all the spacious Welkin Ring. From thy fresh Lawrels shall the Olive spring, Thy Victories shall bring us Peace, And under Thee, our most Indulgent King, Shall Industry and Arts increase; Quiet we shall possess, but not Inglorious Ease. Then shall each fertile Mead, and grateful Field, Amply reward our Care and Toil; The Herds and Flocks a vast increase shall yield, Which raging War shall never spoil, Free from Invading Force, and from Intestine Broil. And though our plenteous Isle shall need no more, Than what its Soil for Natives does provide, Yet added to its mighty Store, Whatever any Foreign Coast, Of Plenty, or of Wealth can boast, Shall on our Happy Shores flow in beside, From the superfluous Bounty of each Tide. Now Av'rice or Ambition in the Great, Shall under thee thy Godlike Power pervert, Rewards nor Threats corrupt thy Judgment Seat; Nor Trusts be gain'd but by desert, While thy Great Self thy Wisdom shalt exert. Then shall the vile ungrateful murm'ring Band, Whom our great Moses has set free From Egypts Bondage, and Idolatry, Glad to submit to his Command; For shame their guilty Heads hang down, Owning the best of Kings that ever fill'd the Throne. Thus the Prophetick Muses say, And all the VVise and Good will say, That they long, long, may celebrate this Day. Soon Haughty France shall bow, and Coz'ning Rome, And Britain Mistress of the World become; And from thy wise, thy Godlike Sway, Kings learn to Reign, and Subjects to Obey. On this Blest Day let every Voice, And, &amp;c. An Ode on the Queens Birth-Day, Sang before their Majesties at Whitehal. By Tho. Shadwell. Now does the glorious Day appear, The mightiest Day of all the Year; Not any one such Joy could bring, Not that which ushers in the Spring. That of ensuing Plenty hopes does give, This did the hope of Liberty retrieve; This does our Fertile Isle with Glory Crown, And all the Fruits it yields we now can call our own. On this blest day was our Restorer born, Far above all let this the Kalender Adorn. II. It was a work of full as great a weight, And require the self-same Power, Which did frail Humane kind Create, When they were lost them to restore; For a like Act, Fate gave our Princes Birth, Which adding to the Saints, made Joy in Heaven, As well as Triumphs upon Earth, To which so great, so good a Queen was given. III. By beauteous softness mixt with Majesty, An Empire over every Heart she gains, And from her awful Power none could be free, She with such Sweetness and such Justice Reigns: Her Hero too, whose Conduct and whose Arms The trembling Papal World their Force most yield, Must bend himself to her victorious Charms, And give up all the Trophies of each Field. Our dear Religion, with our Laws defence, To God her Zeal, to Man Benevolence; Must her above all former Monarch raise To be the everlasting Theme of Praise; No more shall we the great Eliza boast, For her Great Name in Greater Mary's will be lost. Now now, with one united Voice Let us aloud proclaim our Joys; Io Triumphe let us sing, And make Heaven's mighty Concave Ring. FINIS. The Oservator. Or the History of Hodge, as reported by some; from his siding with Noll, and scribling for Rome. Stand forth thou grand Impostor of our time, The Nations scandal, Punishment and Crime; Unjust Usurper of ill gotten Praise, Unmatch'd by all but thy leud Brother Bays; How well have you your sev'ral Gallants chose, Damnably to plague the World in Verse and Prose. Like two Twin Comets: when you do appear We justly may suspect some danger near. He lately did under correction pass, Honour'd by that great hand that gave the Lash, A doom too glorious for that cursed head, And unproportion'd to the Life he lead, But you are to a viler fate design'd, To suffer by a vulgar hand like mine, We'll tear your Vizard and unmask your shame, And at each corner Gibbet up your name. Expose you to the Scorn of all you meet, As Dogs drag grinning Cats about the Street. Under Usurping Noll you first began To rear your Head and shew your self a Man; Unpittying saw the Royal Party fall, And Danc'd and Fiddled to the Funeral; Disclaim'd their Interest and renounc'd their side, And with the Independant straight comply'd; Officious in their Service wrote for Hire; A brisk Crowdero in the Factious Quire: Your nimble Pen on all their Errands run; The Horoscope still opens to the Sun. There 'twas in those unhappy days, You laid foundation for designed Praise; By disrespect ignobly purchas'd shame, And damn'd your Soul to scandalize your Name: When Charles at length by Providence came in, You fac'd about and quickly chang'd the Scene; Turn'd to new Notes your mercenary strings, Began to play Divinity of Kings: Your former Master straightway is forgot, Stil'd Villain, Rogue, Thief, Murderer, what not? Such recompence he doth deserve to have, Who for his Interest durst employ a Knave. Now 'twas a time you thought to take your ease, After such great Exploits perform'd as these: Applauding to your self your own deserts, You strait set up for a vain Ass of Parts; Resolving that the Ladies too should know, What other Tricks and Gambals you could do. Was there a skipping Whore about the Town? Or private Baudy-house to you unknown? Here for a Stallion, there for a Pimp you went; To do both Drudgeries alike content. But Ill success you had with Madam C?k, Whom in the Act her Husband took: Strong Bastinado o're your shoulders laid, Made you a while surcease that letcherous trade, Till growing old in customary sin, You with a Chaster Lady did begin, Whom when you found she all Assaults refus'd, And would not yield her self to be abus'd; Down on your Knees you presently was laid, And thus (O righteous Heaven) devoutly pray'd: Since you disdain the kind request to grant, Dear Madam let me lay my hand upon't. This is the Man whose whole Discourse and tone, Is Honour, Justice, Truth, Religion; Was such a Godly Rascal ever known? But now reform'd by indigence of Gold. Your former wanton course grew slack and cold, For 'twas at first indeed too hot to hold. Now new expedients must employ your Brain, And other Methods for advance of Gain; Something contriv'd in private, touch'd the State, Which made you timely think of a retreat; Beyond Sea then the wretched Caitiff flies, A guilty Conscience has Quick-sighted Eyes. When you return'd, you fell to work amain, And took up your old Scribling trade again; Some sorry scandal on Fanaticks thrown, And viler Canting upon Forty one; You thought sufficient to oblige the Crown; Then who but you, the World was all your own. Now for the Church of England you declare, A witty zealous Protestant appear; Your secret spies and emissaries use To pay for false Intelligence and News: When nam'd in two Diurnals you dispence Equally void of Reason, Truth, and Sense. Guinea's now from every quarter came To pay respect to your encreasing Fame, While you at Sam's like a grave Doctor sate, Teaching the Minor Clergy how to prate, Who lickt your Spittle up and then came down, And shed the nasty Drivel o're the Town. Ay these were blessed times and happy days, When all the World conspired to your praise: He who refus'd and would no Token send, Must be traduc'd as the Dissenters Friend: And that your Greatness no regard might lack, You got a Knighthood chopt upon your Back. But something now has stopt that rapid stream, And you have nothing more to say for them: Your piercing Eye discovers from a far, The glittering Glory of some further Star, Which bids you pay your adoration there. Inconstant Rover, whether do'st thou tend? When will thy tedious Villanies have end? Whither at last do'st thou intend to go? Of which party wilt thou e'er prove true? To Turk, or Pope, to Protestant or Jew? Should I here all thy Villanies recount, To what a mighty summ do they amount? Thy solemn Protestations, Oaths and Lies, Devices, Shams, Evasions, Perjuries, My Paper to a Volumn would exceed, Of greater bulk than Hollingshead and Speed. For thou art now so scandalously known, And so remarkable in Vice alone, That every one can find a stone to throw At such a snarling pimping Cur as thou. But wretch! if still thou art not past all Grace, And wholsome counsel can with thee find place; If thou at last sincerely wouldst attone, And expiate thy former mischiefs done, Like dying Judas render back thy pelf, Recant thy Books and then go hang thy self. The Farewell. I Farewell P?, farewell Cross; Farewell C?, farewell Ass. Farewell P?, farewell Tool, Farewell S?, farewell Fool. II Farewell M?, farewell Scot; Farewell B?, farewell Sot. Farewell R?, farewell Trimmer; Farewell D?, farewell Rhymer. III Farewell B?, farewell Villain; Farewell W?, worse than Tresilian. Farewell Chancellor, farewell Mace; Farewell Prince, farewell Race. IV Farewell Q?, farewell Passion; Farewell K?, farewell Nation, Farewell Priests, and farewell Pope; Farewell all that deserve a R?. The SCAMPERERS. To the Tune of, Packinton's Pound. [I] When the Joy of all Hearts, &amp; desire of all Eyes, In whom our chief Refuge and Confidence lies, The Protestant Bulwark against all Despair, Has depriv'd us at once, of her self and her Heir: That hopeful young Thing, Begot by a King, And a Q. whose Perfections o'er all the world ring. A Father whose Courage no Mortal can daunt, And a Mother whose Virtue no Scandal can taint. II When Jeffryes resigns up the Purse and the Mace, Whose impudent Arrogance gain'd him the place, When, like Lucifer, thrown from the height of his pride, And the Knot of his Villanies strangely unty'd. From the Chancery Bawling, He turns a Tarpaulin; Men still catch at any thing when they are falling: But a plague of ill fortune, before he could scoure, He was taken at Wapping, and sent the Tower. III When Confessor Petre's does yield up the Game, And proves to the worst of Religion a shame; When his cheating no more o're our Reason prevails, But is blasted like that of his true Prince of Wales: Which was his Contrivance, And our Wise King's Connivance, To establish the Papists, and Protestants drive hence: But their Cobweb Conception is brought to the Test, And the coming of Orange has quite spoil'd the Jest: IV When Pet? noted for all that is ill, Was urg'd by his Wife to the making his Will; At the hearing which words he did stare, foam &amp; roar, Then broke out in Cursing and calling her Whore. And for two hours at least His Tongue never ceas'd, He rail'd on Religion, and damn'd the poor Priest, And his Friends, who had hope to behold him expire, Are afraid by this Bout they shall lose their desire. V Young S? fam'd in this great Expedition, Not for going to War, but obtaining Commission; It's no Mystery to me if his Courage did fail, When the greatest of Monarchs himself did turn Tail: So that if he took Flight, With his Betters by night, I am apt to believe the pert Spark was i'th' right: For the Papists this Maxim do every where hold, To be forward in Boasting, in Courage less Bold. VI Nor should B?, P?, and A? throng, But each in due place have his Attributes sung. Yet since 'tis believ'd by the strange turn of Times, They'll be call'd to account for their Treasonable Crimes, While the Damn'd Popish Plot, Is not yet quite forgot, For which the Lord St? went justly to Pot; And to their great comfort I'll make it appear, They that gave them their Freedom, themselves are not clear. VII Wi. W?, that Friend to the Bishops and Laws, As the Devil would have it, espous'd the wrong Cause; Now loath'd by the Commons, and scorn'd by the Peers, His Patent for Honour, in pieces he tears, Both our Britains are fool'd, Who the Laws over-rul'd, And next Parliament each will be plaguily school'd: Then try if your Cunning can find out a Flaw To preserve you from Judgment according to Law. VIII Sir Edward Hale's Actions I shall not repeat, Till by Axe, or by Halter, his Life he compleat, Pen's History shall be related by Lobb, Who has ventur'd his Neck for a Snack in the Jobb, All their Priests and Confessors, With their Dumb Idol-Dressers, Shall meet that Reward which is due to Transgressors, And no Papist henceforth shall these Kingdoms inherit, But ORANGE shall reap the Fruit of his Merit. The Miracle; How the Dutchess of Modena (being in Heaven) prayed the B. Virgin that the Queen might have a Son, and how our Lady sent the Angel Gabriel with her Smock; upon which the Queen was with Child. To the Tune of, O Youth, thou handst better been starv'd at Nurse. In Bartholomew-Fair. [I] You Catholick States men and Church-men rejoyce, And Praise Heavens Goodness with Heart and with Voice; None greater on Earth or in Heaven than she, Some say she's as good as the best of the three. Her Miracles bold, Were Famous of Old, But a braver than this is was never yet told; 'Tis pity that every good Catholick living, Had not heard on't before the last day of Thanksgiving. II In Lombardy-Land, great Modena's Dutchess Was snatch'd from her Empire by Death's cruel Clutches, When to Heaven she came (for thither she went) Each Angel received her with Joy and Content. On her knees she fell down, Before the bright Throne, And begg'd that Gods Mother would grant her one Boon; Give England a Son (at this Critical Point) To put little Orange's Nose out of Joynt. III As soon as our Lady had heard her Petition, To Gabriel, the Angel, she straight have Commission; She pluck'd off her Smock from her shoulders divine, And charg'd him to hasten to Englands fair Queen. Go to the Royal Dame, To give her the same, And bid her for ever to praise my Great Name; For I, in her favour, will work such a Wonder, Shall keep the most Insolent Hereticks under. IV Tell James (my best Son) his part of the matter Must be with this, Only to cover my Daughter; Let him put it upon her with's own Royal Hand; Then let him go Travel to visit the Land; And the Spirit of Love, Shall come from above, Tho not as before, in form of a Dove; Yet down he shall come in some likeness or other, (Perhaps like Count Dada) and make her a Mother. V The Message with hearts full of Faith were receiv'd, And the next news we heard was Q. M. conceiv'd; You great ones Converted, poor cheated Dissenters, Grave Judges, Lords, Bishops, &amp; Commons, Consenters You Commissioners all, Ecclesiastical, From M? the Dutiful, to C? the Tall; Pray Heaven to strengthen Her Majesties Placket, For if this Trick fail, beware of your Jacket. DIALOGUE. M. Why am I daily thus perlex'd? Why beyond Womans patience vex'd? Your Spurious Issue grow and thrive; VVhile mine are dead e'er well alive. If they survive a nine days wonder, Suspicious Tongues aloud do thunder; And streight accuse my Chastity, For your damn'd Insufficiency: You meet my Love with no desire, My Altar damps your feeble fire: Though I have infinite more Charms Than all you e'er took to your Arms. The Priest at th'Altar bows to me; VVhen I appear he bends the Knee. His Eyes are on my Beauties fixt, His Pray'rs to Heav'n and Me are mixt; Confusedly he tells his Beads, Is out both when he Prays and Reads. I travell'd farther for your Love, Than Sheba's Queen, I'll fairly prove. She from the South, 'tis said, did rome, And I as far from East did come. But here the difference does arise, Though equally we sought the Prize; VVhat that great Queen desir'd she gain'd, But I soon found your Treasury drain'd, Your Veins corrupted in your Youth, 'Tis sad Experience tells this Truth: Though I had caution long before Of that which I too late deplore. J. Pray, Madam, let me silence break, As I have you, now hear me speak. These Stories sure must please you well, You're apt so often them to tell. But, if you'll smooth your brow a while, And turn that Pout into a Smile, I doubt not, but to make't appear, That you the great'st Aggressor are. I took you with an empty Purse, Which was to me no trivial Curse, No Dowry could your Parents give; They'd but a Competence to live. When you appear'd, your Charming Eyes (As you relate) did me surprize With VVonder, not with Admiration, Astonishment, but no Temptation: Nor did I see in all your Frame, Ought could create an amorous flame, Or raise the least Desire in me, Save only for Variety. I paid such Service as was due, VVorthy my self, and worthy you: Caress'd you far above the rate Both of your Birth, and your Estate. VVhen soon I found your haughty mind VVas unto Sov'raignty inclin'd; And first you practis'd over me The heavy Yoke of Tyranny, VVhile I your Property was made, And you, not I, was still obey'd: Nor durst I call my Soul my own, You manag'd me as if I'd none. I took such measures as you gave, All day your Fool, all night your slave. Nor was Ambition bounded here, You still resolv'd your course to steer: All that oppose you, you remove; 'Twas much you'd own the Powers above. Now several Stratagems you try, And I'm in all forc'd to comply: To Mother Church you take Recourse, She tells you 'tmust be done by force; And you, impatient of delay, Contrive and execute the way. When mounted to the place you sought, It no Contentment with it brought: One Tree within your Prospect stood Fairest and tallest of the Wood: Which to your prospect gave offence, And it must be remov'd from thence. In this you also are obey'd, While all the Fault on me is laid. Now you was quiet for a while, As flattering Weather seems to smile, Till buzzing Beetles of the Night Had found fresh matter for your spite, And set to work your busie Brain, Which took Fire quickly from their Train. Some VVise, some Valiant, you remove, 'Cause they your Maxims don't approve; And in in their stead such Creatures place VVhich to th'Employments bring disgrace: While whatsoe'r you do I own, And still the dirt on me is thrown. Straight new Chimear's fill your Brain, The humming Beetles buz again; A Goal-Delivery now must be, All tender Consciences set free; Not out of Zeal, but pure Design To make Dissenters with us joyn, To pull down Test and Penal Laws, The Bulwark of the Hereticks Cause. The sly Dissenters laugh the while, They see where lurks the Serpents guile; And rather than with us comply, Will on our Enemies rely. The Chieftains of the Protestant Cause, We did confine, though 'gainst the Laws: But soon was glad to set 'em free, Fearing the giddy Mobile. Now all is turning upside down, Loud Murmuring's in every Town; We've Foes abroad, and Foes at home, Armies and Fleets against us come: The Protestants do laugh the while, And the Dissenters sneer and smile; But no assistance either sends; They're neither Enemies now Friends. Now pray conclude what must be done, Consult your Oracle of ROME, For next fair Wind be sure they come. The Prophesie. When the K. leaves of S??ly, &amp; holds to the Queen And B??wick has fought as many Battles as he's seen, Then Cl??ford shall look like a Lass of fifteen, And Popery out of this Nation shall run. When M? shall leave off his Lust and his Pride, And C?wall his Pimp, which none but his breed, Then M? Letchery shall be deny'd. And Popery, &amp;c. When B?ly the Cynick leaves being Satyrick, And of his Wifes Vertue writes a large Panegyrick, Then his Manners shall fight for his good Natures Merit, And Popery, &amp;c. When R? gives up his 12 s. i'th' Pound, And the Army does B? Generosity sound, Then D? refusing of Bribes shall be found; And Popery, &amp;c. When G? his Conscience shall fly in's face, And rather than Vote 'gainst, the the Test leav's place, And S? likewise shall have no more Grace; And Popery, &amp;c. When C? and D? for Religion dye Martyrs, And C? refuses to be Knight of the Garter. Then the Country no longer shall the Dragoons Quarter; And Popery, &amp;c. When the K. from the Word he hath given does swerve, And the Judges the Oath they have taken observe, Or for breaking have but what they deserve; And Popery, &amp;c. When Archbishop of York we see Dr. Ken, And Compton made Bishop of London agen, And Herbert Rule, as before, on the Main; And Popery, &amp;c. When N??folk grows Rich, and P??is grows poor, When N? is humble S?cer demure, When the Town can love one, &amp; the other endure; And Popery, &amp;c. When T?l's turn'd out, and an Ormond put in, When the Groom of the Stool thinks declaring a Sin, Then Oxford shall have his Regiment agen; And Popery, &amp;c. When the P? of Denmark leaves W? direction, And is suff'red to bring what she breeds to perfection, And a Parliament's call'd by a legal Election, And Popery, &amp;c. When Fe??hams Conduct a Souldier shall prove him, And the Chancellour beggs that the King would remove him, Oh, then we shall see how the People will love him; And Popery, &amp;c. When Petres and P? Council shall fail, And if what the Q. goes with shou'd prove a Female, Lord! How wou'd the Romish Religion prevail, That out of this Nation it might not turn. An Excellent new Ballad, call'd, the Prince of Darkness; shewing how three Nations may be set on Fire by a Warming-Pan. As I went by St. James's I heard a Bird sing, Of certain, the Q. has a Boy in the Spring, But one of the Chair-men did laugh and did say, It was born over Night, &amp; brought forth the next day; This Bantling was heard at St. James's to squaul, Which made the Q. make so much haste from White-H. Peace, Peace, little Master, and hold up thy head, Here's Money bid for thee, the true Mother said; But no body knows from what Parish it came, And that is the reason it has not a Name. Good Catholicks all were afraid it was dying, There was such abundance of sighing and crying; VVhich is a good Token by which we may swear, It is the Q?s own, and the Kingdoms right Heir. Now if we should happen to have a true Lad, From the Loins of so wholsom a Mother and Dad, 'Twere hard to determine which Blood were the best, That of Southask, or the Bastard of Est; But now we have cause for Thansgiving indeed, There was no other way for mending the Breed.

The Popish Crew did all protest, That twenty great men would swear at least, They see his Welsh Highness creep out of his Nest; Sing lulla, &amp;c. The Goggle-ey'd Monster in the Tower, He peep'd at his Birth for above an hour, And 'twas a true Prince of Wales he swore: Sing lulla, &amp;c. Another great Lord, both Grave and VVise, Stood peeping between Her Majesties Thighs; He look'd through a Glass for to save his Eyes: Sing lulla, &amp;c. Both were so well satisfy'd, They knew the sweet Babe from a thousand they cry'd; 'Twas Born with the Print of a Tile on his Side: Sing lulla, &amp;c. Some say 'tis a Prince of Wales by Right, And those that deny it tis out of Spight; But God send the Mother came honestly by't: Sing lulla, &amp;c. Some Priest, they say, crept nigh her Honour, And spinkled some good Holy VVater upon her: VVhich made her conceive of what has undone her. Sing lulla, &amp;c. The Papists thought themselves greatly blest, Before the young Babe was brought to the Test; But now they call Peters a Fool of a Priest: Sing lulla, &amp;c. The Priests in order to fly to the Pope, Are got on Board on the Foreign Hope, For all that stay here will be sure of a Rope: Sing lulla by Babee, by, by, by. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vol. II. From The Reign of K. James the First, To this Present Year 1703. THE FOREIGNERS. Long time had Israel been disus'd from Rest, Long had they been by Tyrants sore opprest; Kings of all sorts they ignorantly crav'd, And grew more stupid as they were enslav'd: Yet want of Grace they impiously disown'd, And still like Slaves beneath the Burthen groan'd: With languid Eyes their Race of Kings they view, The Bad too many, and the Good too few; Some rob'd their Houses, and destroy'd their Lives, Ravish'd their Daughters, and debauch'd their Wives; Prophan'd the Altars with polluted Loves, And worship'd Idols in the Woods and Groves. To Foreign Nations next they have recourse; Striving to mend, they made their State much worse. They first from Hebron all their Plagues did bring, Cramm'd in the single Person of a King; From whose base Loins ten thousand Evils flow, Which by Succession they must undergo. Yet sense of Native Freedom still remains, They fret and grumble underneath their Chains; Incens'd, enrag'd, their Passion does arise, 'Till at his Palace-Gate their Monarch dies. This Glorious Feat was by the Fathers done, Whose Children next depos'd his Tyrant Son, Made him, like Cain, a murd'rous Wanderer, Both of his Crimes, and of his Fortunes share. But still resolv'd to split on Foreign Shelves, Rather than venture once to trust themselves, To Foreign Courts and Councils do resort, To find a King their Freedoms to support: Of one for mighty Actions fam'd they'r told, Profoundly Wise, and desperately Bold, Skilful in War, Successful still in Fight, Had vanquish'd Hosts, and Armies put to flight; And when the Storms of War and Battels cease, Knew well to steer the Ship of State in Peace, Him they approve, approaching to their sight, Lov'd by the Gods, of Mankind the Delight. The numerous Tribes resort to see him land, Cover the Beach, and blacken all the Strand; With loud Huzza's they welcom him on shore, And for their Blessing do the Gods implore. The Sanhedrim conven'd, at length debate The sad Condition of their drooping State, And sinking Church, just ready now to drown; And with one Shout they do the Heroe crown. Ah happy Israel! had there never come Into his Councils crafty Knaves at home, In combination with a Foreign Brood, Sworn Foes to Israel's Rights and Israel's Good; Who impiously foment intestine Jars, Exhaust our Treasure, and prolong our Wars; Make Israel's People to themselves a Prey, Mislead their King, and steal his Heart away: United Interests thus they do divide, The State declines by Avarice and Pride; Like Beasts of Prey they ravage all the Land, Acquire Preferments, and usurp Command: The Foreign Inmates the Housekeepers spoil, And drain the Moisture of our fruitful Soil. If to our Monarch there are Honours due, Yet what with Gibeonites have we to do? When Foreign States employ 'em for their Food, To draw their Water, and to hew their Wood. What Mushroom Honours does our Soil afford! One day a Begger and the next a Lord. What dastard Souls do Jewish Nobles wear! The Commons such Affronts would never bear. Let no Historian the sad Stories tell Of thy base Sons, O servile Israel! But thou, my Muse, more Generous and Brave, Shalt their black Crimes from dark Oblivion save To future Ages shalt their Sins disclose, And brand with Infamy thy Nation's Foes. A Country lies, due East from Juda's shore, Where stormy Winds and noisy Billows roar; A Land much differing from all other Soils, Forc'd from the Sea, and buttress'd up with Piles. No Marble Quarrys bind the spungy Ground, But Loads of Sand and Cockle-shells are found: Its Natives void of Honesty and Grace, A boorish, rude, and an inhumane Race; From Nature's Excrement their Life is drawn, Are born in Bogs, and nourish'd up from Spawn. Their hard-smoak'd Beef is their continual Meat, Which they with Rusk their luscious Manna eat. Such Food with their chill Stomachs best agrees, They sing Hosannah to a Mare's-milk Cheese. To supplicate no God, their Lips will move, Who speaks in Thunder like Almighty Jove: But watry Deities they do invoke, Who from the Marshes most Divinely croak. Their Land, as if asham'd their Crimes to see, Dives down beneath the Surface of the Sea. Neptune, the God who does the Seas command, Ne'er stands on Tip-toe to descry their Land; But seated on a Billow of the Sea, With ease their humble Marshes does survey. These are the Vermin do our State molest; Eclipse our Glory, and disturb our Rest. BENTIR in the inglorious Roll the first, Bentir to this and future Ages, curst, Of mean Descent, yet insolently proud, Shunn'd by the Great, and hated by the Crowd; Who neither Blood nor Parentage can boast, And what he got, the Jewish Nation lost: By lavish Grants whole Provinces he gains, Made forfeit by the Jewish Peoples Pains; Till angry Sanhedrims such Grants resume, And from the Peacock take each borrow'd Plume. Why should the Gibeonites our Land engross, And aggrandize their Fortunes with our Loss? Let them in foreign States proudly command, They have no Portion in the promis'd Land, Which immemorially has been decreed, To be the Birth-right of the Jewish Seed. How ill does Bentir in the Head appear Of Warriours, who do Jewish Ensigns bear, By such we're grown e'en scandalous in War. Our Fathers Trophies wore, and oft could tell How by their Swords the mighty Thousands fell; What mighty Deeds our Grand-fathers had done, What Battels fought, what Wreaths of Honour won: Thro' the extended Orb they purchas'd Fame, The Nations trembling at their awful Name: Such wondrous Heroes our Fore-fathers were, When we base Souls! but Pigmies are in War: By foreign Chieftains we improve in Skill, We learn how to intrench, not how to kill: For all our Charge are good Proficients made In using both the Pickax and the Spade. But in what Field have we a Conquest wrought? In ten Years War what Battel have we fought? If we a foreign Slave may use in War, Yet why in Council should that Slave appear? If we with Jewish Treasure make him great, Must it be done to undermine the State? Where are the ancient Sages of Renown? No Magi left, fit to advise the Crown? Must we by foreign Councils be undone? Unhappy Israel, who such Measures takes, And seeks for Statesmen in the Bogs and Lakes; Who speak the Language of most abject Slaves, Under the Conduct of our Jewish Knaves. Our Hebrews murder'd in their hoarser Throats; How ill their Tongues agree with Jewish Notes! Their untun'd Prattle does our Sense confound, Which in our Princely Palaces does sound; The self-same Language the old Serpent spoke, When misbelieving Eve the Apple took: Of our first Mother why are we asham'd, When by the self-same Rhetorick we are damn'd? But Bentir, not content with such Command, To canton out the Jewish Nation's Land; He does extend to other Coasts his Pride, And other Kingdoms into Parts divide. Unhappy Hiram! dismal is thy Song; Tho born to Empire, thou art ever young! Ever in Nonage, canst no Right transfer: But who made Bentir thy Executor? What mighty Power does Israel's Land afford? What Power has made the famous Bentir Lord? The Peoples Voice, and Sanhedrims Accord. Are not the Rights of People still the same? Did they e'er differ in or Place or Name? Have not Mankind on equal Terms still stood, Without Distinction, since the mighty Flood? And have not Hiram's Subjects a free Choice To chuse a King by their united Voice? If Israel's People could a Monarch chuse, A living King at the same time refuse; That Hiram's People, shall it e'er be said, Have not the Right of Choice when he is dead? When no Successor to the Crown's in sight, The Crown is certainly the Peoples Right. If Kings are made the People to enthral, We had much better have no King at all: But Kings, appointed for the Common Good, Always as Guardians to their People stood. And Heaven allows the People sure a Power To chuse such Kings as shall not them devour: They know full well what best will serve themselves, How to avoid the dangerous Rocks and Shelves. Unthinking Israel! Ah henceforth beware How you entrust this faithless Wanderer! He who another Kingdom can divide, May set your Constitution soon aside, And o'er your Liberties in Triumph ride. Support your Rightful Monarch and his Crown, But pull this proud, this croaking Mortal down. Proceed, my Muse; the Story next relate Of Keppech, the imperious Chit of State, Mounted to Grandeur by the usual Course Of Whoring, Pimping, or a Crime that's worse; Of Foreign Birth, and undescended too, Yet he, like Bentir, mighty Feats can do. He robs our Treasure to augment his State, And Jewish Nobles on his Fortunes wait: Our ravish'd Honours on his Shoulder wears, And Titles from our ancient Rolls he tears. Was e'er a prudent People thus befool'd, By upstart Foreigners thus basely gull'd? Ye Jewish Nobles, boast no more your Race, Or sacred Badges did your Fathers Grace! In vain is Blood, or Parentages, when Ribbons and Garters can ennoble Men. To Chivalry you need have no recourse, The gawdy Trappings make the Ass a Horse. No more, no more your ancient Honours own, By slavish Gibeonites you are outdone: Or else your ancient Courage reassume, And to assert your Honours once presume; From off their Heads your ravish'd Lawrels tear, And let them know what Jewish Nobles are. The True-born Englishman: A SATYR. The Introduction. Speak, Satyr; for there's none can tell like thee Whether 'tis Folly, Pride, or Knavery, That makes this discontented Land appear Less happy now in Times of Peace, than War: Why Civil Feuds disturb the Nation more Than all our Bloody Wars have done before. Fools out of Favour grudg at Knaves in Place, And Men are always honest in Disgrace: The Court Preferments make Men Knaves in course; But they who would be in them would be worse. 'Tis not at Foreigners that we repine, Wou'd Foreigners their Perquisites resign: The Grant Contention's plainly to be seen, To get some Men put out, and some put in. For this our S?rs make long Harangues, And florid M?rs whet their polish'd Tongues. Statesmen are always sick of one Disease; And a good Pension gives them present Ease. That's the Specifick makes them all content With any King and any Government. Good Patriots at Court-Abuses rail, And all the Nation's Grievances bewail: But when the Sov'reign Balsam's once apply'd, The Zealot never fails to change his Side: And when he must the Golden Key resign, The Railing Spirit comes about again. Who shall this Bubbl'd Nation disabuse, While they their own Felicities refuse? Who at the Wars have made such mighty Pother, And now are falling out with one another: With needless Fears the Jealous Nation fill, And always have been sav'd against their Will: Who fifty Millions Sterling have disburs'd, To be with Peace and too much Plenty curs'd: Who their Old Monarch eagerly undo, And yet uneasily obey the New. Search, Satyr, search; a deep Incision make; The Poison's strong, the Antidote's too weak. 'Tis pointed Truth must manage this Dispute, And down-right English Englishmen confute. Whet thy just Anger at the Nation's Pride; And with keen Phrase repel the Vicious Tide. To Englishmen their own beginnings show, And ask them why they slight their Neighbours so. Go back to elder Times and Ages past, And Nations into long Oblivion cast; To old Britannia's Youthful Days retire, And there for True-Born Englishmen enquire. Britannia freely will disown the Name, And hardly knows her self from whence they came: Wonders that They of all Men shou'd pretend To Birth and Blood, and for a Name contend. Go back to Causes where our Follies dwell, And fetch the dark Original from Hell: Speak, Satyr, for there's none like thee can tell. PART I. Where-ever God erects a House of Prayer, The Devil always builds a Chappel there And 'twill be found upon Examination, The latter has the largest Congregation: For ever since he first debauch'd the Mind, He made a perfect Conquest of Mankind. With Uniformity of Service, he Reigns with a general Aristocracy, No Nonconforming Sects disturb his Reign, For of his Yoke there's very few Complain. He knows the Genius and the Inclination, And matches proper Sins for ev'ry Nation. He needs no Standing-Army Government; He always Rules us by our own Consent: His Laws are easie, and his gentle Sway Makes it exceeding pleasant to obey. The List of his Vice-gerents and Commanders, Out-does your Cæsars, or your Alexanders. They never fail of his Infernal Aid, And he's as certain ne'er to be betray'd. Thro' all the World they spread his vast Command, And Death's Eternal Empire is maintain'd. They rule so politickly and so well, As if they were L? J? of Hell. Duly divided to debauch Mankind, And plant Infernal Dictates in his Mind. Pride the first Peer, and President of Hell, To his share Spain, the largest Province, fell. The subtile Prince thought fittest to bestow On these the Golden Mines of Mexico; With all the Silver Mountains of Peru; Wealth which would in wise hands the World undo: Because he knew their Genius was such, Too Lazy and too Haughty to be Rich. So proud a People, so above their Fate, That if reduc'd to beg, they'll beg in State. Lavish of Money, to be counted Brave, And proudly starve, because they scorn to save. Never was Nation in the World before, So very Rich, and yet so very Poor. Lust chose the Torrid Zone of Italy, Where Blood ferments in Rapes and Sodomy: Where swelling Veins o'erflow with livid Streams, With Heat impregnate from Vesuvian Flames: Whose flowing Sulphur forms Infernal Lakes, And humane Body of the Soil partakes. There Nature ever burns with hot Desires, Fann'd with Luxuriant Air from Subterranean Fires: Here undisturb'd in Floods of scalding Lust, Th'Infernal King reigns with Infernal Gust. Drunk'nness, the Darling Favourite of Hell, Chose Germany to Rule; and Rules so well, No Subjects more obsequiously obey, None please so well, or are so pleas'd as they. The cunning Artist manages so well, He lets them bow to Heav'n and drink to Hell. If but to Wine and him they Homage pay, He cares not to what Deity they pray, What God they worship most, or in what way: Whether by Luther, Calvin, or by Rome, They sail for Heav'n, by Wine he steers them home. Ungovern'd Passion settled first in France, Where Mankind lives in Hast, and thrives by Chance; A Dancing Nation, Fickle and Untrue, Have oft undone themselves and others too: Prompt the Infernal Dictates to Obey, And in Hell's Favour none more great than they. The Pagan World he blindly leads away, And personally rules with Arbitrary Sway: The Mask thrown off, Plain Devil his Title stands; And what elsewhere he Tempts, he there Commands. There with full Gust th'Ambition of his Mind Governs, as he of old in Heav'n design'd. Worship'd as God, his Painim Altars smoke, Embru'd with Blood of those that him Invoke. The rest by Deputies he rules as well, And plants the distant Colonies of Hell. By them his secret Power he maintains, And binds the World in his Infernal Chains. By Zeal the Irish; and the Rush by Folly: Fury the Dane: The Swede by Melancholy: By stupid Ignorance, the Muscovite: The Chinese, by a Child of Hell, call'd Wit; Wealth makes the Persian too Effeminate: And Poverty the Tartars Desperate: The Turks and Moors by Mah'met he subdues: And God has giv'n him leave to rule the Jews: Rage rules the Portuguese, and Fraud the Scotch, Revenge the Pole, and Avarice the Dutch. Satyr be kind, and draw a silent Veil, Thy Native England's Vices to conceal: Or if that Task's impossible to do, At least be just, and show her Vertues too; Too Great the first, Alas! the last too Few. England unknown as yet, unpeopled lay; Happy, had she remain'd so to this day, And not to every Nation been a Prey. Her Open Harbours, and her Fertile Plains, The Merchants Glory these, and those the Swains, To every Barbarous Nation have betray'd her, Who Conquer her as oft as they Invade her. So Beauty guarded but by Innocence, That ruins her which should be her Defence. Ingratitude, a Devil of Black Renown, Possess'd her very early for his own. An Ugly, Surly, Sullen, Selfish Spirit, Who Satan's worst Perfections does Inherit: Second to him in Malice and in Force, All Devil without, and all within him Worse. He made her First-born Race to be so rude, And suffer'd her to be so oft subdu'd: By several Crowds of wandring Thieves o'er-run, Often unpeopl'd, and as oft undone. While every Nation that her Powers reduc'd, Their Languages and Manners introduc'd; From whose mix'd Relicks our compounded Breed, By Spurious Generation does succeed; Making a Race uncertain and unev'n, Deriv'd from all the Nations under Heav'n. The Romans first with Julius Cæsar came, Including all the Nations of that Name, Gauls, Greeks, and Lombards; and by Computation, Auxiliaries, or Slaves of every Nation. With Hengist, Saxons; Danes with Sueno came, In search of Plunder, not in search of Fame. Scots, Picts, and Irish from th'Hibernian Shore: And Conqu'ring William brought the Normans o'er. All these their barbarous Off-spring left behind, The Dregs of Armies, they of all Mankind: Blended with Britons who before were here, Of whom the Welsh ha' blest the Character. From this Amphibious Ill-born Mob began That vain ill-natur'd thing, an, Englishman. The Customs, Sir-names, Languages, and Manners Of all these Nations are their own Explainers: Whose Relicks are so lasting and so strong, They've left a Shibboleth upon our Tongue; By which with easie search you may distinguish Your Roman-Saxon-Danish-Norman English. The great invading Wm. the Conq. Norman let us know What Conquerors in after-Times might do. To every Or Archer. Musqueteer he brought to Town, He gave the Lands which never were his own. When first the English Crown he did obtain, He did not send his Dutchmen home again. No Reassumptions in his Reign were known, D' Avenant might there ha' let his Book alone. No Parliament his Army cou'd disband: He rais'd no Money, for he paid in Land. He gave his Legions their Eternal Station, And made them all Freeholders of the Nation. He Canton'd out the Country to his Men, And ev'ry Soldier was a Denizen. The Rascals thus enrich'd, he call'd them Lords, To please their upstart Pride with new made words, And Doomsday-Book his Tyranny records. And here begins our Ancient Pedigree, That so exalts our poor Nobility: 'Tis that from some French Trooper they derive, Who with the Norman Bastard did arrive: The Trophies of the Families appear; Some show the Sword, the Bow, and some the Spear, Which their Great Ancestor, forsooth, did wear. These in the Heralds Register remain, Their Noble mean Extraction to explain. Yet who the Hero was, no Man can tell, Whether a Drummer or a Colonel: The silent Record blushes to reveal Their Undescended Dark Original. But grant the best, How came the Change to pass; A True-Born Englishman of Norman Race? A Turkish Horse can show more History, To prove his Well-descended Family. Conquest, as by the Dr. Sherl. de Facto. Moderns 'tis exprest, May give a Title to the Lands possest: But that the Longest Sword shou'd be so Civil, To make a Frenchman English, that's the Devil. These are the Heroes that despise the Dutch, And rail at new-come Foreigners so much; Forgetting that themselves are all deriv'd From the most Scoundrel Race that ever liv'd, A horrid Croud of Rambling Thieves and Drones, Who ransack'd Kingdoms and dispeopled Towns. The Pict and Painted Briton, Treach'rous Scot, By Hunger, Theft, and Rapine, hither brought: Norwegian Pirates, Buccaneering Danes, Whose Red-hair'd Off-spring ev'ry where remains: Who join'd with Norman French, compound the Breed From whence your True-Born Englishmen proceed. And left by Length of Time it be pretended, The Climate may this Modern Breed ha' mended; Wise Providence, to keep us where we are, Mixes us daily with exceeding Care: We have been Europe's Sink, the Jakes where she Voids all her Offal Out-cast Progeny. From our Fifth Henry's time, the Strolling Bands Of banish'd Fugitives from neighb'ring Lands, Have here a certain Sanctuary found, Th'Eternal Refuge of the Vagabond: Where in but half a common Age of Time, Borr'wing new Blood and Manners from the Clime, Proudly they learn all Mankind to contemn, And all their Race are True-born Englishmen. Dutch, Walloons, Flemings, Irishmen, and Scots, Vaudois and Valtolins, and Hugonots, In good Queen Bess's Charitable Reign, Supply'd us with three hundred thousand Men. Religion, God we thank thee, sent them hither, Priests, Protestants, the Devil and all together: Of all Professions, and of ev'ry Trade, All that were persecuted or afraid; Whether for Debt or other Crimes they fled, David at Hackelah was still their Head. The Off-spring of this Miscellaneous Crowd Had not their new Plantations long enjoy'd, But they grew Englishmen, and rais'd their Votes At Foreign Shoals for Interloping Scots. The K. J. 1. Royal Branch from Pictland did succeed. With Troops of Scots and Scabs from North-by-Tweed. The Seven first Years of his Pacifick Reign Made him and half his Nation Englishmen. Scots from the Northern Frozen Banks of Tay, With Packs and Plads came Whigging all away: Thick as the Locusts which in Egypt swarm'd, With Pride and hungry Hopes compleatly arm'd: With native Truth, Diseases, and no Money, Plunder'd our Canaan of the Milk and Honey. Here they grew quickly Lords and Gentlemen, And all their Race are True-Born Englishmen. The Civil Wars, the common Purgative, Which always use to make the Nation thrive, Made way for all that stroling Congregation, Which throng'd in Pious Ch?s's Restoration. The Royal Refugee our Breed restores, With Foreign Courtiers, and with Foreign Whores: And carefully repeopled us again, Thoughout his Lazy, Long, Lascivious Reign, With such a blest and True-born English Fry, As much Illustrates our Nobility. A Gratitude which will so black appear, As future Ages must abhor to hear: When they look back on all that Crimson Flood, Which stream'd in Lindsey's, and Caernarvan's Blood: Bold Strafford, Cambridge, Capel, Lucas, Lisle, Who crown'd in Death his Father's Fun'ral Pile. The Loss of whom, in order to supply, With a True-born English N?ty, Six Bastard Dukes survive his Luscious Reign, The Labours of Italian C?n, French, P?h, Tabby S?t, and Cambrian: Besides the Num'rous Bright and Virgin Throng, Whose Female Glories shade them from my Song. This Off-spring, if one Age they multiply, May half the House with English Peers supply: There with true English Pride they may contemn S?g and P?d, new-made Noblemen. French Cooks, Scotch Pedlars, and Italian Whores, Were all made L?ds, or L?ds Progenitors. Beggars and Bastards by this new Creation, Much multiply'd the P?ge of the Nation; Who will be all, e'er one short Age runs o'er, As True-Born L?ds as those we had before. Then to recruit the Commons he prepares, And heals the Latent Breaches of the Wars; The pious Purpose better to advance, H' invites the banish'd Protestants of France: Hither for God's-sake and their own they fled, Some for Religion came, and some for Bread: Two hundred thousand Pair of Wooden Shooes, Who, God be thank'd, had nothing left to lose, To Heav'n's great Praise did for Religion fly, To make us starve our Poor in Charity. In ev'ry Port they plant their fruitful Train, To get a Race of True-Born Englishmen: Whose Children will, when Riper Years they see, Be as Ill-natur'd and as Proud as we: Call themselves English, Foreigners despise, Be Surly like us all, and just as Wise. Thus from a Mixture of all Kinds began That Het'rogeneous Thing, An Englishman: In eager Rapes, and furious Lust begot, Betwixt a Painted Briton and a Scot: Whose gend'ring Off-spring quickly learn'd to Bow, And yoke their Heifers to the Roman Plough: From whence a Mongrel half-bred Race there came, With neither Name, nor Nation, Speech or Fame: In whose hot Veins new Mixtures quickly ran, Infus'd betwixt a Saxon and a Dane. While their Rank Daughters, to their Parents just, Receiv'd all Nations with Promiscuous Lust. This Nauseous Brood directly did contain The well-extracted Blood of Englishmen. Which Medly canton'd in a Heptarchy, A Rhapsody of Nations to supply, Among themselves maintain'd eternal Wars, And still the Ladies lov'd the Conquerors. The Western Angles all the rest subdu'd; A bloody Nation, barbarous and rude: Who by the Tenure of the Sword possest One part of Britain, and subdu'd the rest. And as great things denominate the small, The Conq'ring part gave Title to the Whole. The Scot, Pict, Britain, Roman, Dane, submit, And with the English-Saxon all Unite: And these the Mixture have so close pursu'd, The very Name and Memory's subdu'd: No Roman now, no Britain does remain; Wales strove to separate, but strove in vain: The silent Nations undistinguish'd fall, And Englishman's the common Name for all. Fate jumbl'd them together, God knows how; What e'er they were, they're True-Born English now. The Wonder which remains is at our Pride, To value that which all wise Men deride. For Englishmen to boast of Generation, Cancels their Knowledg, and lampoons the Nation. A True-Born Englishman's a Contradiction, In Speech an Irony, in Fact a Fiction: A Banter made to be a Test of Fools, Which those that use it justly ridicules: A Metaphor invented to express A Man a-kin to all the Universe. For as the Scots, as Learned Men ha' said, Throughout the World their Wand'ring Seed have spread; So open-handed England 'tis believ'd, Has all the Gleanings of the World receiv'd. Some think of England, 'twas our Saviour meant, The Gospel should to all the World be sent: Since, when the Blessed Sound did hither reach, They to all Nations might be said to preach. 'Tis well that Vertues give Nobility, How shall we else the want of Birth and Blood supply? Since scarce one Family is left alive, Which does not from some Foreigner derive. Of sixty thousand English Gentlemen, Whose Names and Arms in Registers remain, We challenge all our Heralds to declare Ten Families which English-Saxons are. France justly boasts the Ancient Noble Line Of Bourbon, Montmorency, and Lorain. The Germans too their House of Austria show, And Holland their Invincible Nassau. Lines which in Heraldry were Ancient grown, Before the Name of Englishman was known. Even Scotland too her Elder Glorys shows, Her Gourdons, Hamiltons, and her Monroes; Dowglas, Mackays, and Grahams, Names well known, Long before Ancient England knew her own. But England, Modern to the last degree, Borrows or makes her own Nobility, And yet she boldly boasts of Pedigree: Repines that Foreigners are put upon her, And talks of her Antiquity and Honour: Her S?lls, S?ls, C?ls, De? M?rs, M?ns and M?ues, D?s and V?rs, Not one have English Names, yet all are English Peers. Your H?ns, P?llons, and L?liers, Pass now for Trueborn-English Knights and Squires, And make good Senate Members, or Lord-Mayors. Wealth, howsoever got, in England makes Lords of Mechanicks, Gentlemen of Rakes: Antiquity and Birth are needless here; 'Tis Impudence and Money makes a P?r. Innumerable City-Knights we know, From Blewcoat-Hospitals and Bridewell flow. Draymen and Porters fill the City Chair, And Foot-Boys Magisterial Purple wear. Fate has but very small Distinction set Betwixt the Counter and the Coronet. Tarpaulin L?ds, Pages of high Renown, Rise up by Poor Mens Valour, not their own. Great Families of Yesterday we show, And Lords, whose Parents were the Lord knows who. PART II. The Breed's describ'd: Now, Satyr, if you can, Their Temper show, for Manners make the Man. Fierce, as the Britain; as the Roman, Brave; And less inclin'd to Conquer, than to Save: Eager to Fight, and lavish of their Blood; And equally of Fear and Forecast void. The Pict has made 'em Sour, the Dane Morose: False from the Scot, and from the Norman worse. What Honesty they have, the Saxons gave them, And That, now they grow old, begins to leave them. The Climate makes them Terrible and Bold; And English Beef their Courage does uphold: No Danger can their Daring Spirit pall, Always provided that their Belly's full. In close Intrigues their Faculty's but weak, For gen'rally whate'er they know, they speak: And often their own Councils undermine, By their Infirmity, and not Design; From whence the Learned say it does proceed, That English Treasons never can succeed: For they're so open-hearted, you may know Their own most secret Thoughts, and others too. The Lab'ring Poor, in spite of Double Pay, Are Sawcy, Mutinous, and Beggarly: So lavish of their Money and their Time, That want of Forecast is the Nation's Crime. Good drunken Company is their Delight; And what they get by Day, they spend by Night. Dull Thinking seldom does their Heads engage, But Drink their Youth away, and Hurry on Old Age. Empty of all good Husbandry and Sense; And void of Manners most, when void of Pence. Their strong Aversion to Behaviour's such, They always talk too little, or too much. So dull they never take the pains to think: And seldom are good natur'd but in Drink. In English Ale their dear Enjoyment lies, For which they'll starve themselves and Families. An Englishman will fairly drink as much As will maintain two Families of Dutch: Subjecting all their Labour to their Pots; The greatest Artists are the greatest Sots. The Country Poor do by Example live, The Gentry lead them, and the Clergy drive; What may we not from such Examples hope? The Landlord is their God, the Priest their Pope. A Drunken Clergy, and a Swearing Bench, Has giv'n the Reformation such a Drench, As wise Men think there is some cause to doubt, Will purge good Manners and Religion out. Nor do the Poor alone their Liquor prize, The Sages join in this great Sacrifice, The Learned Men who study Aristotle, Correct him with an Explanation-Bottle; Praise Epicurus rather than Lysander, And The Drunkards Name for Canary. Aristippus more than Alexander. The Doctors too their Galen here resign, And gen'rally prescribe Specifick Wine. The Graduates Study's grown an easier Task, While for the Urinal they toss the Flask. The Surgeon's Art grows plainer ev'ry Hour, And Wine's the Balm which into Wounds they pour. Poets long since Parnassus have forsaken, And say the ancient Bards were all mistaken. Apollo's lately abdicate and fled, And good King Bacchus governs in his stead; He does the Chaos of the Head refine, And Atom-Thoughts jump into Words by Wine: The Inspiration's of a finer Nature; As Wine must needs excel Parnassus Water. Statesmen their weighty Politicks refine, And Soldiers raise their Courages by Wine: Cœcilia gives her Choristers their Choice, And lets them all drink Wine to clear their Voice. Some think the Clergy first found out the way, And Wine's the only Spirit by which they Pray. But others, less profane than so, agree, It clears the Lungs and helps the Memory: And therefore all of them Divinely think, Instead of Study, 'tis as well to Drink. And here I would be very glad to know, Whether our Asgilites may drink or no. Th'Enlightening Fumes of Wine would certainly Assist them much when they begin to fly: Or if a Fiery Chariot shou'd appear, Inflam'd by Wine, they'd ha' the less to fear. Even the Gods themselves, as Mortals say, Were they on Earth, wou'd be as drunk as they: Nectar would be no more Celestial Drink, They'd all take Wine, to teach them how to think. But English Drunkards, Gods and Men out-do, Drink their Estates away, and Senses too. Colon's in Debt, and if his Friends should fail To help him out, must die at last in Goal; His Wealthy Uncle sent a Hundred Nobles, To pay his trifles off, and rid him of his Troubles: But Colon, like a True-Born-Englishman, Drank all the Money out in bright Champain; And Colon does in Custody remain. Drunk'ness has been the Darling of this Realm, E'er since a Drunken Pilot had the Helm. In their Religion they are so unev'n, That each Man goes his own By-way to Heav'n: Tenacious of Mistakes to that degree, That ev'ry Man pursues it sep'rately, And fancies none can find the Way but he: So shy of one another they are grown, As if they strove to get to Heav'n alone: Rigid and Zealous, Positive and Grave, And ev'ry Grace, but Charity, they have: This makes them so Ill-natur'd and Uncivil, That all Men think an Englishman the Devil. Surly to Strangers, Froward to their Friend; Submit to Love with a reluctant Mind, Resolv'd to be Ungrateful and Unkind. If by Necessity reduc'd to ask, The Giver has the difficultest Task: For what's bestow'd they awkardly receive, And always take less freely than they give. The Obligation is their highest Grief; And never love, where they accept Relief. So Sullen in their Sorrows, that 'tis known, They'll rather die than their Afflictions own: And if reliev'd, it is too often true, That they'll abuse their Benefactors too. For in Distress their Haughty Stomach's such, They hate to see themselves oblig'd too much. Seldom contented, often in the Wrong; Hard to be Pleas'd at all, and never long. If your Mistakes their ill-Opinion gain, No Merit can their Favour re-obtain: And if they're not Vindictive in their Fury, 'Tis their Unconstant Temper does secure-ye; Their Brain's so cool, their Passion seldom burns; For all's condens'd before the Flame returns: The Fermentation's of so weak a Matter, The Humid damps the Fume, and runs it all to Water. So tho' the Inclination may be strong, They're pleas'd by sits, and never angry long. Then if good Nature shows some slender Proof, They never think they have reward enough: But like our Modern Quakers of the Town, Expect your Manners and return you none. Friendship, th'abstracted Union of the Mind, Which all Men seek, but very few can find; Of all the Nations in the Universe, None talk on't more, or understand it less: For if it does their Property annoy, Their Property their Friendship will destroy. As you discourse them, you shall hear them tell All things in which they think they do excel: No Panegyrick needs their Praise record; An Englishman ne'er wants his own good word. His long Discourses gen'rally appear Prolong'd with his own wond'rous Character: But to illustrate first his own good Name, He never fails his Neighbour to defame. And yet he really designs no wrong; His Malice goes no farther than his Tongue. But pleas'd to Tattle, he delights to Rail, To satisfy the Lech'ry of a Tale. His own dear Praises close the ample Speech, Tells you how Wise he is, that is, how Rich: For Wealth is Wisdom; he that's Rich is Wise; And all Men Learned Poverty despise. His Generosity comes next, and then Concludes that he's a True-Born-Englishman; And they 'tis known, are Generous and Free, Forgetting, and forgiving Injury: Which may be true, thus rightly understood, Forgiving Ill turns, and forgetting Good. Chearful in Labour when they've undertook it, But out of Humour when they're out of Pocket. But if their Belly and their Pocket's full, They may be Phlegmatick, but never Dull. And if a Bottle does their Brains refine, It makes their Wit as sparkling as their Wine. As for the general Vices which we find They're guilty of in common with Mankind, Satyr, forbear, and silently endure; We must conceal the Crimes we cannot cure. Nor shall my Verse the Brighter Sex defame: For English Beauty will preserve her Name. Beyond dispute Agreeable and Fair; And Modester than other Nations are: For where the Vice prevails, the great Temptation Is want of Money more than Inclination. In general, this only is allow'd, They're something Noisy, and a little Proud. An Englishman is gentlest in Command, Obedience is a Stranger in the Land: Hardly subjected to the Magistrate; For Englishmen do all Subjection bate. Humblest when rich, but peevish when they're poor; And think whate'er they have, they merit more. The meanest English Plow-man studies Law, And keeps thereby the Magistrates in Awe; Will boldly tell them what they ought to do, And sometimes punish their Omissions too. Their Liberty and Property's so dear, They scorn their Laws or Governours to fear: So bugbear'd with the Name of Slavery, They can't submit to their own Liberty. Restraint from Ill, is Freedom to the Wise; But Englishmen do all Restraint despise. Slaves to the Liquor, Drudges to the Pots, The Mob are Statesmen, and their Statesmen Sots. Their Governors they count such dangerous things, That 'tis their Custom to affront their Kings: So jealous of the Power their Kings possess'd, They suffer neither Power nor Kings to rest. The Bad with Force they eagerly subdue; The Good with constant Clamours they pursue: And did King Jesus reign, they'd murmur too. A discontented Nation, and by far Harder to rule in Times of Peace than War: Easily set together by the Ears, And full of causeless Jealousies and Fears: Apt to revolt, and willing to rebel, And never are contented when they're well. No Government cou'd ever please them long, Cou'd tie their Hands, or rectify their Tongue. In this to Ancient Israel well compar'd, Eternal Murmurs are among them heard. It was but lately that they were opprest, Their Rights invaded, and their Laws supprest: When nicely tender of their Liberty, Lord what a Noise they made of Slavery! In daily Tumults show'd their Discontent; Lampoon'd their King, and mock'd his Government. And if in Arms they did not first appear, 'Twas want of Force, and not for want of Fear. In humbler Tone than English us'd to do, At Foreign Hands for Foreign Aid they sue. William, the Great Successor of Nassau, Their Prayers heard, and their Oppressions saw: He saw and sav'd them: God and Him they prais'd; To this their Thanks, to that their Trophies rais'd. But glutted with their own Felicities, They soon their New Deliverer despise; Say all their Prayers-back, their Joy disown, Unsing their Thanks, and pull their Trophies down: Their Harps of Praise are on the Willows hung; For Englishmen are ne'er contented long. The Rev'rend Clergy too! and who'd ha' thought That they who had such Non-resistance taught, Should e'er to Arms against their Prince be brought? Who up to Heaven did Regal Pow'r advance; Subjecting English Laws to Modes of France: Twisting Religion so with Loyalty, As one cou'd never live, and t'other die. And yet no sooner did their Prince design Their Glebes and Perquisites to undermine, But all their Passive Doctrines laid aside; The Clergy their own Principles deny'd: Unpreach'd their Non-resisting Cant, and pray'd To Heaven for Help, and to the Dutch for Aid. The Church chim'd all her Doctrines back again, And Pulpit Champions did the Cause maintain; Flew in the Face of all their former Zeal, And Non-Resistance did at once repeal. The Rabbies say it would be too prolix, To tye Religion up to Politicks: The Churches Safety is Suprema Lex. And so by a New Figure of their own, Their former Doctrines all at once disown. As Laws Post Facto in the Parliament, In urgent Cases have obtain'd Assent; But are as dang'rous Precedents lay'd by, Made Lawful only by Necessity. The Rev'rend Fathers then in Arms appear, And Men of God became the Men of War. The Nation, Fir'd by them, to Arms apply; Assault their Antichristian Monarchy. To their due Channel all our Laws restore, And made things what they shou'd ha' been before. But when they came to fill the Vacant Throne, And the Pale Priests look'd back on what they'd done; How English Liberty began to Trive, And Church of England Loyalty out-live: How all their persecuting Days were done, And their Deliv'rer plac'd upon the Throne; The Priests, as Priests are wont to do, turn'd Tail; They're Englishmen, and Nature will prevail. Now they deplore the Ruins they ha' made, And murmur for the Master they betray'd: Excuse those Crimes they cou'd not make him mend; And suffer for the Cause they can't defend. Pretend they'd not have carry'd things so high; And Proto-Martyrs make for Popery. Had the Prince done as they design'd the thing, Ha set the Clergy up to rule the King; Taken a Donative for coming hither, And so ha' left their King and them together, We had, say they, been now a happy Nation; No doubt we we 'ad seen a Blessed Reformation: For Wise Men say 'tis as dangerous a thing, A Ruling Priesthood, as a Priest-rid King. And of all Plagues with which Mankind are Curst, Ecclesiastick Tyranny's the Worst. If all our former Grievances were feign'd, King James has been abus'd, and we Trapann'd; Bugbear'd with Popery and Power Despotick, Tyrannick Government, and Leagues Exotick: The Revolution's a Phanatick Plot, W? a Tyrant, S? a Scot: A Factious Army, and a poyson'd Nation, Unjustly forc'd King James's Abdication. But if he did the Subjects Rights invade, Then he was punish'd only, not betray'd; And punishing of Kings is no such Crime, But Englishmen ha' done it many a Time. When Kings the Sword of Justice first lay down, They are no Kings, though they possess the Crown Titles are Shadows, Crowns are empty things, The Good of Subjects is the End of Kings; To guide in War, and to protect in Peace; Where Tyrants once commence, the Kings do cease: For Arbitrary Power's so strange a thing, It makes the Tyrant, and unmakes the King. If Kings by Foreign Priests and Armies reign, And Lawless Power against their Oaths maintain, Then Subjects much ha' reason to complain. If Oaths must bind us when our Kings do ill; To call in Foreign Aid is to Rebel. By force to circumscribe our Lawful Prince, Is wilful Treason in the largest Sense: And they who once Rebel, most certainly Their God, and King, and former Oaths defy. If we allow no Male-Administration Could cancel the Allegiance of the Nation; Let all our Learned Sons of Levi try, This Eccles'astick Riddle to unty: How they could make a Step to call the Prince, And yet pretend to Oaths and Innocence. By th'first Address they made beyond the Seas, They're perjur'd in the most intense Degrees; And without scruple for the time to come, May swear to all the Kings in Christendom. And truly did our Kings consider all, They'd never let the Clergy Swear at all: Their Politick Allegiance they'd refuse; For Whores and Priests do never want excuse. But if the Mutual Contract was dissolv'd, The Doubt's explain'd, the Difficulty solv'd: That Kings when they descend to Tyranny, Dissolve the Bond, and leave the Subject free. The Government's ungirt, when Justice dies, And Constitutions are Non-Entities. The Nation's all a Mob, there's no such thing As Lords or Commons, Parliament or King. A great promiscuous Croud the Hydra lies, Till Laws revive, and mutual Contract ties: A Chaos free to chuse for their own share, What Case of Government they please to wear. If to a King they do the Reins commit, All Men are bound in Conscience to submit: But then that King must by his Oath assent To Postulata's of the Government; Which if he breaks, he cuts off the Entail, And Power retreats to its Original. This Doctrine has the Sanction of Assent, From Nature's Universal Parliament. The Voice of Nature, and the Course of Things, Allow that Laws superiour are to Kings. None but Delinquents would have Justice cease, Knaves rail at Law, as Soldiers rail at Peace: For Justice is the End of Government, As Reason is the Test of Argument. No Man was ever yet so void of Sense, As to debate the Right of Self-Defence; A Principle so grafted in the Mind, With Nature born, and does like Nature bind: Twisted with Reason and with Nature too; As neither one nor t'other can undo. Nor can this Right be less when National; Reason which governs one, shou'd govern all. Whate'er the Dialect of Courts may tell, He that his Right demands, can ne'er Rebel. Which Right, if 'tis by Governours deny'd, May be procur'd by Force, or Foreign Aid. For Tyranny's a Nation's Term of Grief; As Folks cry Fire, to hasten in Relief. And when the hated Word is heard about, All Men sho'd come to help the People out. Thus England groan'd, Britannia's Voice was heard; And Great Nassau to rescue her appear'd: Call'd by the Universal Voice of Fate; God and the Peoples Legal Magistrate. Ye Heav'ns regard! Almighty Jove, look down, And view thy Injur'd Monarch on the Throne. On their ungrateful Heads due Vengeance take, Who sought his Aid, and then his part forsake. Witness, ye Powers! It was our Call alone, Which now our Pride makes us asham'd to own. Britannia's Troubles fetch'd him from afar, To court the dreadful Casualties of War: But where Requital never can be made, Acknowledgment's a Tribute seldom pay'd. He dwelt in Bright Maria's Circling Arms, Defended by the Magick of her Charms, From Foreign Fears, and from Domestick Harms. Ambition fround no Fuel for her Fire, He had what God cou'd give, or Man desire. Till Pity rouz'd him from his soft Repose, His Life to unseen Hazards to expose: Till Pity mov'd him in our Cause t'appear; Pity! that Word which now we hate to hear. But English Gratitude is always such, To hate the Hand which does oblige too much. Britannia's Cries gave Birth to his Intent, And hardly gain'd his unforeseen Assent: His boding Thoughts foretold him he should find The People Fickle, Selfish and Unkind. Which Thought did to his Royal Heart appear More dreadful than the Dangers of the War: For nothing grates a generous Mind so soon, As base Returns for hearty Service done. Satyr be silent, awfully prepare, Britannia's Song, and William's Praise to hear. Stand by, and let her chearfully rehearse Her Grateful Vows in her Immortal Verse. Loud Fame's Eternal Trumpet let her sound; Listen ye distant Poles, and endless Round. May the strong Blast the welcome News convey As far as Sound can reach, or Spirit can fly. To Neighb'ring Worlds, if such there be, relate Our Hero's Fame, for theirs to imitate. To distant Worlds of Spirits let her rehearse: For Spirits without the helps of Voice converse. May Angels hear the gladsome News on high, Mix'd with their everlasting Symphony. BRITANNIA. The Fame of Vertue 'tis for which I sound, And Heroes with Immortal Triumphs crown'd. Fame built on solid Vertue swifter flies, Than Morning-Light can spread my Eastern Skies. The gath'ring Air returns the doubling Sound, And loud repeating Thunders force it round: Ecchoes return from Caverns of the Deep: Old Chaos dreams on't in Eternal Sleep: Time hands it forward to its latest Urn, From whence it never, never shall return; Nothing is heard so far, or lasts so long; 'Tis heard by ev'ry Ear, and spoke by ev'ry Tongue. My Hero, with the Sails of Honour furl'd, Rises like the Great Genius of the World. By Fate and Fame wisely prepar'd to be The Soul of War, and Life of Victory. He spreads the Wings of Virtue on the Throne, And ev'ry Wind of Glory fans them on. Immortal Trophies dwell upon his Brow, Fresh as the Garlands he has won but now. By different Steps the high Ascent he gains, And differently that high Ascent maintains. Princes for Pride, and Lust of Rule make War: And struggle for the Name of Conqueror. Some-fight for Fame, and some for Victory; He Fights to Save, and Conquers to set Free. Then seek a Phrase his Titles to conceal, And hide with Words what Actions must reveal. No Parallel from Hebrew Stories take, Of God-like the Kings my Similies to make: No borrow'd Names conceal my living Theam; But Names and Things directly I proclaim. 'Tis honest Merit does his Glory raise; Whom that Exalts, let no Man fear to Praise; Of such a Subject no Man need be shy; Vertue's above the Reach of Flattery. He needs no Character, but his own Fame, Nor any flattering Titles, but his Name. William's the Name that's spoke by ev'ry Tongue; William's the Darling Subject of my Song. Listen ye Virgins to the Charming Sound, And in Eternal Dances hand it round: Your early Offerings to this Altar bring; Make him at once a Lover and a King. May he submit to none but to your Arms; Nor ever be subdu'd, but by your Charms. May your soft Thoughts for him be all Sublime; And ev'ry tender Vow be made for him. May he be first in ev'ry Morning Thought, And Heav'n ne'er bear a Pray'r, when he's left out. May ev'ry Omen, ev'ry boding Dream, Be fortunate by mentioning his Name; May this one Charm Infernal Powers affright, And guard you from the Terrors of the Night. May ev'ry chearful Glass, as it goes down, To William's Health, be Cordials to your own. Let ev'ry Song be Chorust with his Name, And Musick pay her Tribute to his Fame. Let ev'ry Poet tune his Artful Verse, And in Immortal Strains his Deeds rehearse. And may Apollo never more inspire The Disobedient Bard with his Seraphick Fire. May all my Sons their grateful Homage pay, His Praises sing, and for his Safety pray. Satyr, return to our Unthankful Isle, Secur'd by Heaven's Regard, and William's Toil. To both Ungrateful, and to both Untrue; Rebels to God, and to Good Nature too. If e'er this Nation be Distress'd again, To whomsoe'er they cry, they'll cry in vain. To Heav'n they cannot have the Face to look: Or if they should, it would but Heaven provoke. To hope for Help from Man would be too much; Mankind would always tell 'em of the Dutch: How they came here our Freedoms to maintain, Were Pay'd, and Curs'd, and Hurry'd home again. How by their Aid we first dissolv'd our Fears, And then our Helpers damn'd for Foreigners. 'Tis not our English Temper to do better: For Englishmen think ev'ry Man their Debtor. 'Tis worth observing, that we ne'er complain'd Of Foreigners, nor of the Wealth they gain'd, Till all their Services were at an end. Wise Men affirm it is the English way. Never to Crumble till they come to Pay; And then they always think their Tempers such, The Work too little, and the Pay too much. As frighted Patients, when they want a Cure, Bid any Price, and any Pain endure: But when the Doctor's Remedies appear, The Cure's too Easy, and the Price too Dear. Great Portland ne'er was banter'd when he strove For Us his Master's kindest Thoughts to move. We ne'er lampoon'd his Conduct, when employ'd King James's Secret Councils to divide: Then we caress'd him as the only Man, Which could the doubtful Oracle explain: The only Hushai able to repel The dark Designs of our Achitophel. Compar'd his Master's Courage to his Sense; The Ablest Statesman, and the Bravest Prince. On his wise Conduct we depended much, And lik'd him ne'er the worse for being Dutch. Nor was he valu'd more than he deserv'd; Freely he ventur'd, faithfully he serv'd. In all King William's Dangers he has shar'd; In England's Quarrels always he appear'd. The Revolution first, and then the Boyne; In both his Counsels and his Conduct shine. His Martial Valour Flanders will confess; And France regrets his Managing the Peace. Faithful to England's Interest and her King, The greatest Reason of our murmuring. Ten Years in English Service he appear'd, And gain'd his Masters, and the Worlds Regard: But 'tis not England's Custom to Reward. The Wars are over, England needs him not; Now he's a Dutchman, and the Lord knows what. Sconbergh, the Ablest Soldier of his Age, With Great Nassau did in our Cause engage; Both join'd for England's Rescue and Defence, The Greatest Captain, and the Greatest Prince. With what Applause his Stories did we tell? Stories which Europe's Volumes largely swell. We counted him an Army in our Aid: Where he Commanded, no Man was afraid. His Actions with a constant Conquest shine, From Villa-Vitiosa to the Rhine. France, Flanders, Germany, his Fame confess; And all the World was fond of him but Us. Our Turn first serv'd, we grudg'd him the Command, Witness the Grateful Temper of the Land! We blame the K? that he relies too much On Strangers, Germans, Hugonots, and Dutch; And seldom does his great Affairs of State To English Counsellors communicate. The Fact might very well be answer'd thus; He has so often been betray'd by us, He must have been a Madman to rely On English G?ns Fidelity. For laying other Arguments aside, This Thought might mortifie our English Pride, That Foreigners have faithfully obey'd him, And none but Englishmen have e'er betray'd him. They have our Ships and Merchants bought and sold, And barter'd English Blood for Foreign Gold. First to the French they sold our Turky-Fleet, And injur'd Talmash next, at Camaret. The King himself is shelter'd from their Snares, Not by the Merit, but the Crown he wears. Experience tells us 'tis the English way, Their Benefactors always to betray. And lest Examples should be too remote, A Modern Magistrate of Famous Note, Shall give you his own History by Rote. I'll make it out, deny it he that can, His Worship is a True-Born-English-Man, In all the Latitude that empty Word By Modern Acceptation's understood. The Parish-Books his Great Descent record, And now he hopes e'er long to be a Lord. And truly as things go, it would be pity But such as he should represent the City: While Robb'ry for Burnt-Offering he brings, And gives to God what he has stole from Kings: Great Monuments of Charity he raises, And good St. Magnus whistles out his Praises. To City-Goals he grants a Jubilee, And hires Huzza's from his own Mobilee. Lately he wore the Golden Chain and Gown, With which equip'd he thus harangu'd the Town. His Fine Speech, &amp;c. With Clouted Iron-Shoos, and Sheepskin Breeches, More Rags than Manners, and more Dirt than Riches: From driving Cows and Calves to Layton-Market, While of my Greatness there appear'd no Spark yet, Behold I come, to let you see the Pride With which Exalted Beggars always Ride. Born to the needful Labours of the Plow, The Cart-whip grac'd me as the Chain does now. Nature and Fate in doubt what Course to take, Whether I should a Lord or Plow-boy make; Kindly at last resolv'd they wou'd promote me, And first a Knave, and then a Knight they vote me. What Fate appointed, Nature did prepare, And furnish'd me with an exceeding Care, To fit me for what they design'd to have me; And ev'ry Gift but Honesty they gave me. And thus equip'd, to this proud Town I came, In quest of Bread, and not in quest of Fame. Blind to my future Fate, a humble Boy, Free from the Guilt and Glory I enjoy. The hopes which my Ambition entertain'd, Were in the Name of Foot-Boy all contain'd. The greatest Heights from small Beginnings rise; The Gods were Great on Earth, before they reach'd the Skies. B????well, the Generous Temper of whose Mind, Was always to be bountiful inclin'd; Whether by his ill Fate or Fancy led, First took me up, and furnish'd me with Bread. The little Services he put me to, Seem'd Labours, rather than were truly so. But always my Advancement he design'd; For 'twas his very Nature to be kind. Large was his Soul, his Temper ever free; The best of Masters and of Men to me. And I who was before decreed by Fate, To be made Infamous as well as Great, With an obsequious Diligence obey'd him, Till trusted with his All, and then betray'd him. All his past Kindnesses I trampled on, Ruin'd his Fortunes, to erect my own. So Vipers in the Bosom bred, begin To hiss at that Hand first which took them in. With eager Treach'ry I his Fall pursu'd, And my first Trophies were Ingratitude. Ingratitude, the worst of Humane Guilt, The basest Action Mankind can commit; Which like the Sin against the Holy Ghost, Has least of Honour, and of Guilt the most; Distinguish'd from all other Crimes by this, That 'tis a Crime which no Man will confess. That Sin alone, which shou'd not be forgiv'n On Earth, altho' perhaps it may in Heaven. Thus my first Benefactor I o'rethrew; And how shou'd I be to a second true? The Publick Trust came next into my Care, And I to use them scurvily prepare: My needy Sov'reign Lord I play'd upon, And lent him many a Thousand of his own; For which great Int'rest I took care to Charge, And so my ill-got Wealth became so large. My Predecessor Judas was a Fool, Fitter to have been whip'd and sent to School, Than sell a Saviour: Had I been at hand, His Master had not been so cheap trapann'd; I wou'd ha' made the eager Jews ha' found, For Thirty Pieces, Thirty thousand Pound. My Cousin Ziba, of Immortal Fame, (Ziba and I shall never want a Name:) First-born of Treason, Nobly did advance His Masters Fall, for his Inheritance. By whose keen Arts old David first began To break his Sacred Oath to Jonathan: The good old King 'tis thought was very loth To break his Word, and therefore broke his Oath. Ziba's a Traytor of some Quality, Yet Ziba might ha' been inform'd by me: Had I been there, he ne'er had been content With half th'Estate, nor half the Government. In our late Revolution 'twas thought strange That I of all Mankind should like the Change: But they who wonder'd at it, never knew, That in it I did my old Game pursue; Nor had they heard of Twenty thousand Pound, Which never yet was lost, nor ne'er was found. Thus all things in their turn to Sale I bring, God and my Master first, and then the King: Till by successful Villanies made Bold, I thought to turn the Nation into Gold; And so to Forg?ry my Hand I bent, Not doubting I could gull the Government; But there was ruffl'd by the Parliament. And if I scap'd th'Unhappy Tree to climb, 'Twas want of Law, and not for want of Crime. But my The Devil. Old Friend, who printed in my Face A needful Competence of English Brass, Having more Business yet for me to do, And loth to lose his Trusty Servant so, Manag'd the Matter with such Art and Skill, As sav'd his Heroe, and threw out the B?ll. And now I'm grac'd with unexpected Honours, For which I'll certainly abuse the Donors: Knighted, and made a Tribune of the People, Whose Laws and Properties I'm like to keep well: The Custos Rotulorum of the City, And Captain of the Guards of their Banditti. Surrounded by my Catchpoles, I declare Against the needy Debtor open War. I hang poor Thieves for stealing of your Pelf, And suffer none to rob you but my self. The King commanded me to help reform ye, And how and when I'll do't, Miss shall inform ye. I keep the best Seraglio in the Nation, And hope in time to bring it into Fashion. No Brimstone Whore need fear the Lash from me, That part I'll leave to Brother Jeffery. Our Gallants need not go abroad to Rome, I'll keep a Whoring Jubilee at Home. Whoring's the Darling of my Inclination; A'n't I a Magistrate for Reformation? For this my Praise is sung by ev'ry Bard, For which Bridewell would be a just reward. In Print my Panegyricks fill the Street, And hired Goal-Birds their Huzza's repeat. Some Charities contriv'd to make a Show, Have taught the needy Rabble to do so; Whose empty Noise is a Mechanick Fame, Since for Sir Belzebub they'd do the same. The Conclusion. Then let us boast of Ancestors no more, Or Deeds of Heroes done in Days of Yore, In latent Records of the Ages past, Behind the Reer of Time, in long Oblivion plac'd. For if our Vertues must in Lines descend, The Merit with the Families would end: And Intermixtures would most fatal grow; For Vice would be Hereditary too: The Painted Blood would of necessity, In Voluntary Wickedness convey. Vice, like Ill-Nature, for an Age or two, May seem a Generation to pursue: But Vertue seldom does regard the Breed; Fools do the Wise, and Wise Men Fools succeed. What is't to us what Ancestors we had? If Good, what better? Or what worse, if Bad? Examples are for Imitation set, Yet all Men follow Vertue with regret. Cou'd but our Ancestors retrieve their Fate, And see their Off-spring thus Degenerate; How we contend for Birth and Names unknown, And build on their past Actions, not our own; They'd cancel Records, and their Tombs Deface, And openly disown the Vile Degenerate Race: For Fame of Families is all a Cheat, 'Tis Personal Vertue only makes us Great. FINIS. ÆSOP at Tunbridge; or a few Select FABLES in Verse. Fab. I. Fair Warning. In Æsop's new-made World of Wit, Where Beasts could talk, and read, and write, And say and do as he saw fit; A certain Fellow thought himself abus'd, And represented by an Ass: And Æsop to the Judge accus'd That he defamed was. Friend, quoth the Judge, how do you know Whether you are defam'd or no? How can you prove that he must mean You, rather than another Man? Sir, quoth the Man, it needs must be, All Circumstances so agree, And all the Neighbours say 'tis Me. That's somewhat, quoth the Judge, indeed; But let this Matter pass, Since 'twas not Æsop, 'tis agreed, But Application made the Ass. Fab. II. The Cock and Pearl. A dunghil Cock was raking in the Ground, And flirted up a Pearl; I would, quoth he, thou hadst been found By some great Lord or Earl. My self a single Barley-corn Would, surely, rather find: We Creatures that are dull, Earth-born, Things only useful mind. Whilst they who are divinely Wise, And do from Jove proceed, Thy lovely orient Lustre prize, And for thy Beauty trade. Fab. III. Of the Horse and the Ass. A Horse and Ass were journeying on their way; The Horse was only harness'd, light, and gay; The Ass was heavy loaden, and lagg'd behind, And thus, at length, bespake his Friend. Companion, take some pity on my State; And ease me but of half my Weight. Half will to you no burden be, And yet a mighty help to me. The Horse laugh'd loud, and shook his Head, And wantonly curvetting said; Seignior, we Horses never chuse The Burdens that we can refuse; And should such Jest upon me pass, Methinks I should be but an Ass. The Ass quite spent, and vext to be deny'd, Sunk down beneath his Weight, and dy'd. The Master coming up, took off the Sack, And threw it on the Horse's Back: And having flaid his Ass, he threw The filthy Hide upon him too. At which the Horse, thus sadly humbled, cry'd; (Letting some Tears for Grief and Anger fall) Whether 'twere Cruelty, or Pride, That I so fair Request deny'd, I'm justly serv'd, and made to carry all. The Asses of the South and East Desire the Horses of the North and West, That, as to Parliament they trot, This Fable may not be forgot. Fab. IV. Of the Iudgment of the Ape. A Wolf complain'd that he had lost a Lamb, And strait impleads a Fox of no good Fame. (Who had a Lamb) that he had stoln the same. An Ape was to decide the Cause, Having some Knowledg in the Laws. No Council was by either feed, Each would his Cause, in Person, plead; And so they did, with mighty heat; The Judge himself did almost sweat To hear the Force of their Debate, How they accuse, and how defend, How they reply'd, join'd and rejoin'd At length in pity to the Court, The Judg was fain to cut them short; And thus determin'd—Sirs, in troth, The Lamb belongs to neither of you both. You, Mr. Wolf, have doubtless lost no Lamb; And, Reynard, you as surely stole that same, But not from him. If Justice might prevail, You should be both condemn'd to Fine and Jail. So two great Lords for an Estate may fight, Which does to neither appertain by Right. Fab. V. Of the Horse and Man. A fierce wild Boar of monstrous size and force, Did once, in early days, affront a Horse; Who meditating Vengeance, found his Will To hurt much greater than his Power and Skill; And therefore, chaf'd and resolute, he ran To the next House, and thus apply'd to Man. I come, Superior Power, whom Jove hath made His Substitute on Earth, to seek thy Aid. Against a sordid Brute, who injures me, And likewise speaks contemptibly of Thee. Jove, whom thou nam'st (said Man) was to thee kind, And sent thee where thou shalt Assistance find. But this injurious Boar will never meet Our Arms upon the Plain, but trusts his Feet. But shall his Feet then his Protection be, Since Swiftness is the Gift of Jove to thee? (Mark it, my Friend, this Insolence Deprives us of our common Sense.) This doubtless he forgot; so will not we. You, for Convenience, will a while submit To be directed with a Bridle and Bit; And take me on your Back, till we shall see This your outragious Enemy. Up, said the Horse then, let us never rest, Till we have found this cursed Beast. Away then to the Woods they flew, The Horse his Haunts and Coverts knew, And there his Foe, the dext'rous Warrior, slew. This done, they jocond homewards make, And thus the Horse the Man bespake. Now, Sir, accept my Thanks for what is past, I to my wonted Fields, and Friends must hast. Hold, quoth the Man, we part not quite so soon; Your Business is, but Mine is not yet done. Some Service there remains, due to the Aid I lent you, which must be repaid. This said, he light, and ty'd him to a Rack; Where the poor Creature, thus with Sorrow spake. Slight was the Injury of the Boar, And might, perhaps, have been no more: Bvt now I'm utterly undone, My Ease and Liberty are gone. Sweet is Revenge, just in the Taste, But surely Bitterness at last. Let other Creatures warning take, What Bargains they in Passion make. Let Nations also take good care, That they with many Hardships bear, Rather than seek Redress abroad, Which is but adding to their Load. Fab. VI. The Bargain. Two Welchmen Partners in a Cow, Resolv'd to sell her dear; And laid their Heads together, how To do't at Ludlow Fair. It was a sultry Summers Day, When out they drove the Beast; And having got about half way, They sat them down to rest. The Cow, a Creature of no Breeding, (The Place with Grass being stor'd) Fed by; and whilst she was a feeding, Let fall a mighty T?. Roger, quoth Hugh, I tell thee what, Two Words and I have done; If thou wilt fairly eat up that, The Cow is all thy own. 'Tis done, quoth Roger, 'tis agreed, And to't he went apace; He seem'd so eager set, 'tis said, That he forgot his Grace. He labour'd with his wooden Spoon, And up he slopt the Stuff; Till, by the time that half was done, He felt he had enough. He felt: but scorning to look back, Would look as if he wanted more; And seem'd to make a fresh Attack, With as much Vigour as before. But stopping short a while, he cry'd, How fares it, Neighbour Hugh? I hope, by this, you're satisfied, Who's Master of the Cow. Ay, ay, quoth Hugh (the Devil choke thee, For nothing else can do't) I'm satisfy'd that thou hast broke me, Unless thou wilt give out. Give out! quoth Roger, thaa were fine; Why, what have I been doing? But yet I tell thee, Friend of mine, I shall not seek thy Ruin. My Heart now turns against such Gains; I know th'art piteous poor, Eat thou the half that still remains, And 'tis as 'twas before. God's Blessing on thy Heart, quoth Hugh, That Proffer none can gainsay; With that he readily fell to, And eat his share o'th'Tansie. Well now, quoth Hodge, w'are ev'n no doubt, And neither side much Winner: So had we been, quoth Hugh, without This damn'd confounded Dinner. Let this, both to our Wars and Peace Be honestly apply'd; France and th'Allies have done no less, Than what these Welch-men did. Fab. VII. The Frogs Concern. Two first young Bulls within the Marshes strove For the Reward of Empire, and of Love; Which should the fairest Heifer gain, And which should govern all the Plain. This, when a Frog hard by perceiv'd, He sigh'd, and sob'd, and sorely griev'd, He hung his Head, and made great moan, As tho he'd lost his Wife or Son. At which a neighbouring Frog admir'd, And kindly of the Cause enquir'd; Which when he knew, he said in hast, And Gossip, is this all at last? If this and that great Loggerhead Bull Will try the Thickness of each others Skull, E'en let them do, as fit they see: But what is that to You and Me? If that, replied the other, were all indeed, We should about this Matter be agreed. I should not care a single Groat, To see 'em tear each others Throat; But, Friend, the Creatures of such Might Can never meet in Field to fight, But in the Fury of their full Career, Both you and I endanger'd are; And all our kindred Tribes below, In hazard of their Lives must go. When Bulls rush on, or when retreat for Breath, They'll tread a hundred of us little Folks to death. If Kings would fight themselves alone, Their People still secure, No mortal Man would part 'em sure, But let them e'en fight on. But when the Subjects Blood is spilt, And their Estates are drain'd, To justify a Prince's Guilt, Or have his Vanity maintain'd; When they must pay for all at last, Their Lust, Ambition, or Revenge lay wast: The poorest Man alive may fear, And pray against the Miseries of War. Fab. VIII. Of a Man and his Ass. A wretched Churl was trav'ling with his Ass, Beneath two Panniers Load opprest; And hearing noise behind, cry'd to the Beast, Fly, my Friend Roger, fly apace; Else I'm undone, and all my Market's naught; And thou thy self wilt by the Rogues be caught. Caught? quoth the Beast, what if I be? What will it signify to me? My Panniers are so full, they'll hold no more; I carry two, and cannot carry four. 'Twixt Rogues and You I can no difference make, They are all Rogues to me, who break my Back. Fly, fly from France, our Statesmen cry, And Slavery's cursed Yoke; Whilst with our Ancient Liberty Our very Backs are broke. France is a Thief; but France can do no more, Than keep the Panniers on we had before. Fab. IX. Of a Wolf. A Wolf retiring from Whitehall, Where he had Statesman been, Built for himself a Box so small, That few could be receiv'd within. The Country all admir'd at this, And could not at the Reason guess, Why one so Wealthy and so Great, Should cage himself at such a rate. Till at the last a Fox came by, A Courtier also, sleek and sly, And thus in earnest and in jest, His Reason gave among the rest, Perhaps my Lord Commissioner intends, Here to receive only his honest Friends. Fab. X. The Plaintiff and Defendant. Two Travellers an Oyster found, Dropt from some Pannier down; Each stoopt, and took it from the Ground, And claim'd it as his own. Since both can't have it all, said one, E'en let it parted be. No, says the other, all or none, But all belongs to me. One Serjeant Law by chance came by, And he must end the Strife: Which thing he did immediately, With his deciding Knife. He took the Fish and cut it up, (This Cause he opened well) And fairly did the Oyster sup, And gave to each a Shell. And if hereafter Causes rise, Where People can't agree, I know, quoth he, you'll be so wise To refer them still to me. My Name is Law, my Chambers are At some of th'Inn of Court, Or Serjeants Inns, or Westminster, Where all for help resort. Sir, quo' the Men, trust us for that, We shall not fail to tell, 'Tis Law that did the Oyster eat, And left to Us the Shell. Fab. XI. Of the Pigeons. The Hawks were once at mortal Jars, Which came at length to Civil Wars. The Pigeons they stood looking on, And, full of Pity, made great moan, To see how bloodily they fought, And each the others Ruin sought. And never would these Creatures cease, Till they had mediated a Peace. The Hawks did easily consent, So Peace was made, and home they went; Where when they came and wanted Prey, And how to pass their time away, They fairly made one general Swoop, And eat their Mediators up. Two lucky Pigeons were not there, And so escap'd the Massacre. Of which the one to th'other said, How came our Kindred all so mad? Parting of Hawks! Hawks ever shou'd Be gorg'd with one anothers Blood. The Wicked have a natural Rage, (A thirst of Violence to asswage) Which if not on the Wicked spent, Will fall upon the Innocent. So the poor Hugonots of France, And Vaudois full as poor, Pray'd loudly, in their Innocence, That God would Peace restore. Peace was restor'd; but Peace to them No Safety did restore: Their Hawks employ'd their Power and Time Much worse than e'er before. And thou, O Church of England Dove, Doat not upon thy Peace, That may, than War, more fatal prove Both to thy Wealth and Ease. Fab. XII. The Farmer and the Hare. A Hare did once into a Garden get Belonging to a Farm; Where she began to throw up Earth, and eat, And do some little Harm. The Farmer cours'd her round and round, But got her not way; Puss took a liking to the Ground, And there resolv'd to stay. Well, quoth the Fellow, in a Fret, Since you are grown so bold, I shall some more Assistance get, And drive you from your Hold. And strait he sends to a young Squire, That he, by break of day, Would with his Pack of Hounds repair, And sport himself that way. The Squire, as ask'd, attended came, With Folks, and Horse, and Hounds, And in pursuance of the Game, Rode over all the Grounds. They leapt the Ditches, broke the Hedges down, And made most fearful Wast; They trampl'd all the Garden round, And kill'd poor Puss at last At this the Farmer tore his Hair, And swore most bloodily, Z?ds! What confounded work is here? And what a Fool am I? Not fifty Hares, in fifty Days, Had so much mischief done, As this good Sqaire (whom I must praise And thank) hath wrought in One. If our Deliverance from the Frights Of standing Army near, And silly superstitious Rites, Worth Forty Millions were; Then have we wisely broke our Mounds, That our Defences were, Wisely call'd in our Neighbours Hounds, And kill'd the desperate Hare. But if, with all this vast Expence, Besides a Sea of Blood Spilt in the Church and States Defence, Our Matters stand much as they stood: Then have we done a World of Ill, With endless Cost and Pains, A little hurtful Hare to kill, And well deserve the Brains. Fab. XIII. Poetry its Cure. 1 A youth of pregnant Parts and Wit, And thirsty after Fame, Was musing long which way to get An everlasting Name. 2 And having heard of Poetry, And its immortal Praise; He thought the way to Fame must ly By courting of the Bays. 3 He heard how many a noble Town Laid claim to Homer's Birth, To purchase from it a Renown Above the rest of th'Earth. 4 This kindl'd in his generous Mind A strong and noble Fire: He seem'd for nothing else design'd, Could nothing else desire. 5 The Father finding this intent Ill with his state agreed, That, living, wanted Six per Cent. Much more than Fame, when dead: 6 Resolv'd to try to cure his Mind, And change his vain Designs, And could no fitter Method find, Than sending him these Lines: Seven wealthy Towns contend for Homer Dead, Through which the Living Homer beg'd. Several other Fables on State-Affairs. Fab. I. The Fox and the Poultry. An aged Fox that ravag'd Woods and Plains, Dread Fox to Cocks and Hens, and Country Swains; The most Tyrannick Reynard e'er was known, Since Beasts bore rule, and hector'd on a Throne. He neither young nor old, when hungry, spar'd; Alike the Lamkins and the Henroost far'd. But Age retards at last his hasty flight, He plunders not so much by day, nor ravages by night; Grown weak and feeble, Wit must now supply His want of Strength— No kind good natur'd Fox will bring him Food, He still must share the Fortune of the Wood. One day as hungry Reynard sat alone, His empty Guts and Fortune did bemoan; Said he, I'll try what aged Craft can do, New Methods find, a new Device pursue: Hard by a Tarbox lay, some careless Swain Had left when he kept Sheep upon the Plain. Projecting Reynard will a diligent care Bedawbs his Belly, Sides and Back with Tar: Then to a Ditch he goes, where t'other day He did a Hen and all her Chickens slay; Their Feathers still lay scatter'd on the Ground, In which the Fox did wallow, tumble round; The Feathers sticking still as he did rowl, Made him resemble much a larger Fowl. And thus transform'd into a new disguise, Into a neighbouring Henroost strait he hies: And just beneath the Roost his station took, And looking on the Perch, the Poultry thus bespoke. Kind gentle Cocks and Hens, I am No more your Foe: What once I did, is now my shame, And for the future I the same No more will do. I come not as an Enemy Your Lives to take, But would with you in Friendship be, As you may judge if you but see The Clothes upon my Back. Come down then Friends, a lasting Truce 'Twixt you and I; I'll neither Cocks nor Hens abuse, Let us shake hands as Lovers use, Be Friends until we die. No, quoth the Cock, you will as much devour As e'er you did, were but it in your power: Your vain pretence of Kindness we abhor, And from our Perch we will not downward stir: You've chang'd your Coat, but have not chang'd your Name; If that were alter'd too, your Nature is the same. In vain do those, who heretofore Our Liberties betray'd Unto a wild Despotick Pow'r, And level all our Fences laid: In vain they talk of Property, Or think to be believ'd; Their Actions give their Tongue the lie: Who can be thus deceiv'd? Their vain pretence of publick Good Is for sinister Ends; And who the Dee'l, when understood, Wou'd be such Villains friends? They'd feed the Flock only to steal the Fleece; When the Fox preaches, then beware the Geese. Fab. II. The Poor Man and the Devil. A lab'ring Swain had been at work, And all his Limbs had tir'd, By using Shovel, and the Fork, To rest at Night retir'd. So sweet's the sleep of Country Swains, Such undisturb'd Repose Accompanies their daily pains, That Peace about them flows. No dismal Visions do afright, No Dreams do e'er approach; Within the Curtains of the Night They sleep as sound as any Roach. But now the Swain, in dead of night, An airy Phantom saw; A cloven-footed hideous Spright Him out of Bed did draw: And led him to an Orchard fair, Where pointing to a Tree, Beneath that Stock, he said, is there A fund of Gold for thee. But how, reply'd the sleeping Swain, Shall I this Treasure find, Or know that self-same Tree again, No mark being left behind? Then quoth the Dee'l, shit near the place; And thus, upon my word, To morrow when thou view'st the Grass, Thou't know it by the T? Thus did the Swain; when he awoke, And rais'd his drozy Head, He found not as the Devil spoke, But found a T? in Bed. Thus sleeping Jacks do dream and snore, And please their foolish mind, In thinking what they were before, And what henceforth they'll find. But if they would right measures take, And govern'd be by Wit; When once their Reason do's awake, They'll find their Cause beshit. Fab. III. The Farmer and the Badger. A Badger once did ravage all the Fields Belonging to a Farm; Dug up the Earth, and spoil'd all that it yields, And did a wond'rous harm. The Farmer haloo'd on his Dog, Thinking thereby to quell her; But being bred to hunt the Hog, He knew not how to kill her. The Farmer sends for a young Squire To come with all his Hounds; His and their Aid he does require, To beat her from her Mounds. The Squire came, with all his Hounds The Badger did pursue. He ravag'd all the Farmer's Grounds, And kill'd the Badger too. Some little mischief true he did, In beating down the Corn, And breaking Hedges as he rid: So small a Loss was born. For, says the Farmer, now my Sheep May more securely graze; My Poultry may the Henroost keep, I'm better than I was. If our Deliverance from our Foes, And Popish Tyranny, Ben't worth the Mony has been rose, 'Tis pity we are free. 'Tis certain wisely we have done, To keep the Nation safe, In giving part as we have done, To save the better half. Fab. IV. The Ravens and Crows. A lusty Horse, not long ago, Would snuffle, snort and kick, Curvet and prance, as others do, Was fallen wondrous sick. 'Twas far from any House or Town, No Doctor cou'd be got; So the poor Beast must die alone, And without burial rot. He restless lay upon the Ground, And turn'd from side to side; His Groans the neighb'ring Woods resound, Where Birds of Prey reside. No sooner did they hear the noise. But from the Woods they flew, Whole Troops of Ravens, and the Crows, And round the Horse they drew. At length a Raven of renown, Strutting like Prince of Conde, As black as any Parson's Gown He wears upon a Sunday; Gets on a Mole-hill, look'd around, And thus bespoke the Crows; We're antient Friends, and without ground We will not now be Foes. You know, by Contract, we're to have The Carrion of this place; And you the other side did crave, Such our Agreement was. No, quoth the Crows, this very place To us is free as Air; And how dare you with such a face, Oppose such Numbers here? Ay, quoth the Raven, then we'l try To whom it doth belong: But first let the poor Creature die, Then see who's right or wrong. Both sides resolv'd to fight it out, Each do's advantage take; They march, and march, and march about, And each one whets his Beak. They view the Ground, and mark the Camp, And the Approaches form; Contrive the easiest Methods how They may the Carcase storm. Mean time the Horse lies dangerous ill, Yet shites, and farts, and groans; Good signs, they say, in Physick skill, And stretching of the Bones. The Horse (tho helpless) by degrees Began to gather strength; At first he rises on his Knees, And on his Legs at length. The Birds of Prey were all surpris'd, And all away they flew; The Battel's thus on both sides lost, And all the Carrion too. Thus some, whom neither Peace nor Wars Can satisfy, still hope for Jars; That by great Princes falling out, They may their Business bring about. And Wonders must be done and said, When once the King of Spain is dead; But he, like Horse, prevents the Fight, And is resolv'd to live in spite. Fab. V. The Summons. The mighty Puss, not long since rul'd the State, Beneath a loneson Furzbush purring sat; Strok'd her long Smellers, and rejoic'd to see Her awful Picture in her Progeny: Mean while her Kitlings dance before her face, And toss, like trembling Mice, the Roots of Grass. Not one amongst 'em but a Claw dos wear, Fit a Monarchic Tyrant Rat to tear. The Good Old Cause inform'd the Mother's Breast, Darts through their Eyes, is by their Mein exprest. Such, such the antient Race of Heroes were, Who did their Rights before their Lives prefer. She calls one to her of the eldest-brood: Dost know, said she, how drown'd in native Blood My Country lies; how the wild Boars invade The Land, and desert have my Country laid? 'Tis true, I once did ease 'em of their Pain; But they, like Fools, embrac'd again the Chain; Wear those dull Fetters I so kindly broke, And halt like Slaves beneath the servile Yoke. Once more I'll try, if my Advice may prove Successful, once exert my antient Love; Summon the Slaves to meet at W?l Gate, Beneath the Scaffold where I whileom sate, And punish'd Tyranny, the worst of Crimes; A just example unto future Times. Young Puss the Message takes, and bids fair Warning To all the Slaves t'appear on the next morning. Fab. VI. The Interview. The Morning come, the Slaves await, And flock like Bees 'bout W?l Gate. Some yok'd, like Country Hogs appear; Others confounded Fetters wear, And some most horrid Burdens bear. Thus loaded, thus enslav'd, opprest; Nature, 'tis strange, don't call for rest: Tho Legs are gall'd, and Shoulders sore, The bulky Slaves still crave for more: And not an Ideot of the Town Has Sense to lay his Burden down. Strait Puss in Majesty appears, Mounting the Scaffold, pricks her Ears, Shakes her Majestick Head, aloud She thus bespoke the num'rous Crowd. I have deserted long the nauseous Town, Mourning my Country's Ruin, and my own, Expos'd to Tyranny, whilst Beasts of prey Ravage my Fields, and steal my Lambs away. My Free-born Subjects now are forc'd to bear Loads, which more fit for backs of Camels are; You well deserve the Fetters you do wear. You under heavy Iron Shackles pine, Whose Fathers did in glorious Armor shine, Thro' fields of Blood to Freedom cut their way, And taught the proudest Tyrants to obey; By me supported, potent Tyrants sell A Sacrifice to their just Cause and Hell. No more, no more their sacred Lineage stain, No more their Names in your curst Race profane. Let not their Off-spring such Alliance have, Shackles were ne'er the Trophies of the Brave; They could wide Conquests, and just Honors boast, But you, dull Slaves! have all your Freedom lost. Where 'ere a Tyrant rais'd his impious Head, Strait their bold Hands strook the damn'd Monster dead. Had you a spark of antient Honor left, You should not long be of my Aid bereft; My Claws are hard and sharp as e'er they were, As fit a Tyrant and his Rats to tear. The Villains that support a Tyrant Crown, This angry Tail will horridly sweep down; Shake off your Fetters once, and you shall see, I'll once more save you from curst Slavery. She said, and away she gallop'd amain, But in hopes they their Sense would recover again; For a Doctor will never the Fatigue endure, To heal such dull Blockheads, that don't love the Cure. Fab. VII. The Frogs Concern. A generous Race of croking Frogs, Which lay intrench't betwixt two Bogs, Who as the Morning Sun did shine, Daily encreas'd their Stock Divine; Just as the Solar Influence burn'd, Prolifick Spawn to Life was turn'd, Until the young ones had at length An equal Vigor, equal Strength. So numerous at length they prove, They supplicate to mighty Jove; A King and Governour they crave, As other Beasts and Insects have; But Jove allow'd all Mortal Elves, To chuse a Monarch for themselves The Croking Elders now consult About a King, and the Result Was, that a neighb'ring Log should be Executor of Monarchy. About the Log their Heads they raise, In sounds uncouth they croke his Praise: At length some crawl upon his Top, And frisk about, and croke and hop: Says one Frog, Here's fine business done, Was e'er a King thus trampl'd on? Troth, says another antient Frog, We'll ne'er be govern'd by a Log. The Heat at length so far arose, They did the Loggerhead depose. To new Election they proceed, And to their Hearts content succeed: A neighb'ring Stork at length they chose, Which shou'd their Heats and Feuds compose; He took upon him the Command Of all the People in Frogland; But he, as t'other 'fore had done, Made it an Arbitrary Throne; Up from the Mud the Frogs would pick, And squeeze their Corps within his Beak. One Frog much wiser than the rest, To those about him thus addrest: Good Friends this is confounded work, Shall we be govern'd by a Stork; To have our Bones in pieces torn, Our young ones eat just as they're born? As if Kings only had a Power To ruin Subjects and devour; I think 'tis just to chuse agen: The Brood of Frogs all crok'd, Amen. The next they chose was a dull Ass, Which prov'd as bad as t'other was; For tho he was not so malicious, His Folly made him as pernicious; Stumbling on Empire, oft he stood Upon his Subjects chokd in Mud: Whole beds of Spawn he did destroy, At every flounce did Frogs annoy. The Devil's in't, said one, for we In chusing Kings still wretched be, Thus often we have chose a K?, And still have found it the same thing. Fab. VIII. The Lion and Fox. A youthful Lion in the Wood, Of Bulk and Nature strong; Still us'd to Rav'ning and to Blood, And came to Empire young: He too, as other Monarchs use, New Methods did pursue: His Father's Fav'rites did refuse, And chose a set of new. He having lov'd, and us'd to gore; An arbitrary Sway, A base, a wild Despotick Pow'r His Subjects must obey. But want of Brains do's still attend Unlimited Command, And therefore he would have some Friend Might Business understand. There was a cunning Fox liv'd near, For many years had kill'd The neighb'ring Lambs and Poultry there, With Bones his Kennel fill'd. He summon'd Reynard to appear, Next Night, at Council Board; Which Reynard did, and when was there, Look'd grave as any Lord. The Lion told him, he must be The chief Support of State; At which kind Reynard bow'd his Knee, And wish'd him better Fate. O, says the Lion, thou art skill'd In Arbitrary Sway: Thou many Beasts and Fowls hast kill'd, To govern know'st the way. Ask, and I'll give Thee any thing, Is in my Pow'r to give, Thou shalt be next unto the King As long as I do live. Quoth Reynard, make me then the Priest, I'll make all Beasts your Slaves: The Body You, I Soul at least, We'll tyrannize by halves. Thus Fate did Men to Thraldom bring, Opprest just like a Beast; Rode, spur'd, and whip'd by such a King, And eke so lewd a Priest. Fab. IX. The Weesil, Rats and Mice. A mighty Weesil of renown, Well vers'd in things of State, Was chosen King all o'er the Town, Of all the Mice and Rats. His Coronation Day was come, And all the Grandees meet The Weesil in a gaudy Room, And bow beneath his Feet. His Chair of State was Rind of Cheese, And o'er his Royal Head Some Bacon swerd in goodly guise, Like Canopy was spread. At length he walks and struts about, Like any Lord or Duke; Sometimes he does one Subject flout, And sometimes one rebuke. He calls an aged Rat aside, And ask'd him his advice, Whether a Project mayn't be try'd To eat up all the Mice. Ay quoth the Rat, your Majesty May be well satisfy'd, Mice haters are of Monarchy, And Regal State deride. The Rats and Weesils now devour The Mice in piteous sort. They dye the Cellars with their Gore, And with their Bones they sport. At length the Mice are all destroy'd, The Weesils and the Rats Would other Food find out abroad, But that they fear'd the Cats. The Weesils now together plot, How they the Rats may eat; Provision must be daily got, Kings must have sumptuous Meat. The Rats now all do go to pot: Some bak'd, some boil'd, some roasted; 'Tis hop'd they had not then forgot How they the Mice accosted. Thus some Men oft by Tyrant Power, Their Kindred Subject-Slaves devour, Do all the Villanies are done To prop a beastly Tyrant Throne; Tho others Blood the Tyrant fill'd, They must at length to's Fury yield; Nought stops a Tyrant's Course but Decollation, Or else a modern Abdication. Fab. X. Lubberland. A land there is, as Maps do tell, (Tho they describe it not right well) Nor near the Hot nor Frigid Zone, But Latitude of fifty one; In Nature's Plenty do's abound, With Fruits and Flocks is amply crown'd: The Natives never are content But with Tyrannick Government; They Men resemble by their Faces, But by their Backs resemble Asses: For each is born with a great Pack, A warlike Saddle on his Back, Which do's adorn the Parts are upper, On nether Parts they wear a Crupper. Their Kings, as 'tis decreed by Jove, Do always jump down from above: Arm'd Cap-a-pee with Boots and Spurs, Just fit to mount such servile Curs: With Hunting-whips they daily maul 'em, And with long rowled Spurs do gall 'em. He only is the great Bravado, Has most the Regal Bastinado. They leap and jump, and frisk and skip, And sing the Praises of the Whip: They bear the Lash without once bogging, Extol the Royal Art of flogging. With Blanket-Coat and Wooden-Shoes, The Man the Camel scarce outdoes. Whilst Freemen feed on Dainties fine, These do on Bread and Garlick dine; And if they spend a Soulx in Wine, The Health drank round must always be, Their King's applauded Tyranny: Still let 'em be curs'd Slaves for me. Fab. XI. The Hawk and Birds. I A Hawk, that of Yore Had long welter'd in Gore, And many a Sparrow had kill'd; By the Birds he was told, Now he was grown old, He his number of Sins had fulfill'd. II Now said the old Hawk, My Actions to balk, If you shall but once thus combino, The Gods will me avenge, My Cause will revenge, I may murder ye Jure Divino. III The Gods, said the Birds, We'll not take their words; If they've gi'n you an Absolute Power, They've gi'n us a part Is not worth a Fart, While you have a Right to devour. IV The Birds all agreed, And thus 'twas decreed, That Slaves they no longer would be; They throttl'd their King, Then sweetly did sing The Praises of free Liberty. Fab. XII. The Asylum. The Princes once did all combine, The Peoples Liberty to mine; Would make them right or wrong obey An absolute Despotick Sway. One Method, was to make us poor, By loading Taxes more and more; For when to Poverty Men fall, They easily are brought to thrall: And when their Spirit's sunk and gone, Tyrants may lay vast Burdens on. This did in some, in all it cou'd Not do: Some Men had better Blood, And tho they could not mend their Fate, They murmur'd at the Tyrant's hate; Which so incens'd the Tyrant's Ire, Some were condemn'd to rav'nous Fire; Some were to slavish Gallies sent, Others in Fetters did lament. Some Men were strangl'd in their Beds, Others were hang'd, some lost their Heads; Some whipt, till bleeding Backs were kill'd, The Lands with Tyranny were fill'd. But those whom better luck and hap Did favour with a wish'd escape, A City on Batavian Shoar Did shelter from the Isles before; Where native Liberty do's thrive, And no curst Tyranny can live. Long live great City, Favorite of Heav'n, And never want those Blessings thou hast giv'n. Fab. XIII. Of the other Members conspiring against the Belly. Once on a Time the Hands and Feet With Back, and Loins, and Bum, did meet In a Rebellious Consult, where The B?ch as Speaker took the Chair, And with an uncouth hollow sound The following Treason did propound: Brethren, quoth he, you know the Head Makes us to toil and sweat for Bread, Yet nothing to our Lot doth fall, But idle Gut consumes it all. My Friends, if you'l be rul'd by me, We will shake off this Tyranny. If Head and Belly will have Meat, Let them toil for't with Hands and Feet. Agreed, says Back, I vow and swear, For them I'll no more Burdens bear. Content, says Bum, if't be your Will; For I love dearly to sit still. Says Feet, I'll no more Errands run. The Loins say, Brethren, it is done. The Hands vow they would work no more, And wish they'd been as wise before. The Members thus in Holy League, Did bless themselves for this Intrigue. But suddenly the Hands grew weak, The Feet grew numb, the Loins did shake, The Back was feeble, the Bum grew poor, And Breech the Chair-man loud did roar, Pray cram the Gut, and we'll rebel no more. It's hop'd this will not be forgot By those who form'd the Tunbridge Plot. Old Æsop was a man of Sense, Such Doctrines never did dispense, That People should refuse Support, And pine themselves to starve the Court. Fab. XIV. The Fable of the Spunge. A certain Brewer, whose Liquor of Life Did frequently amongst his Servants raise strife, Resolv'd to abridg them, giving each Man his share, Enough to suffice, but nothing to spare: But the Servants resolving they would not be stinted, Put their Wits on the Rack, and this Device minted. They got Gloves of Spunge which they thrust in the Liquor, And squeezing them often spent their Masters Stock quicker: Which the Brewer understanding, he seiz'd on the Spunges; Made his Servants repay him, and with Actions them swinges; Till he squeez'd back his own, and taught them to be true, To leave off their sly Cheats, and be content with their Due. Those that misapply the Treasure of the Nation, Ought thus to be squeez'd till they make reparation: We may Tax, and pay on, and the King still be poor, If the Hands of his Servants be pitch'd as before. It's the Interest of the Nation, our Senate understands, That those who touch Cash should have clean washen hands. Fab. XV. Esop sent to Bedlam. Æsop o'ercome with Wind and Spleen, At Tunbridge sought relief; In hopes that change of Air, and Scene, Might ease him of his Grief. But there such Shoals of Fools he met, And Knaves twice dipt in Grain; Not the fam'd Waters they were at, Cou'd e'er take out the Stain. In vain a Friend among the Youth He sought all Tunbridge round; Till sneaking Solitary Truth He in a Corner found. Thus met, they readily agree, And did strange Tales devise Lab'ring to make those Coxcombs see, That would put out their Eyes. Till nettled at their just Reproof, The Knaves and Fools combine; And him and his Companion both To a dark room confine. Next Stage, they knew not why or how, For London they were bound; Where both of 'em together now, In Bedlam may be found. In vain we strive Mens Errors to correct, Or point out Follies which themselves neglect. Fools are a stubborn Race and hard to break, Wisdom's the only Gift they scorn to take; And he that shews his Brains to such a Rout, Takes a fair way to have 'em beaten out. Wise Men in them alone mistake their Tools, Knaves only have the Skill to manage Fools. Let empty Fops be proud of their Mishap, For he that takes it off, deserves the Cap. Fab. XVI. The Priest and Pears. A wanton Sloven of a Priest, Invited to a Bridal Feast, Under a Hedg upon the Ground, A Hoard of Mellow Pears had found. These were, quoth he, to hungry Sinner, That had no hopes of Wedding-Dinner, Brave tempting Morsels, a rich Prize, Which at this juncture I despise, Now to more Rarities engag'd, Than e'er in Noah's Ark were cag'd, Fish, Fowl, Fruit, Sweet-meats, to excite And rouse a founder'd Appetite; Therefore sweet Pears this time adieu, My Stomach will not stoop to you. Yet e'er we part, we'll have a Jest, Then scornfully he on 'em pist, And cry'd, Who e'er these Pears shall eat, He shall have Sauce as well as Meat. This done, impatient of delay, He jocundly persu'd his Way, Most happy in Imagination, Chewing the Cud of Expectation. Till to a Brook approaching nigh, By Rains late fallen swell'd so high, That 'twas impossible to pass; His grumbling Stomach call'd him Ass, And bid him ford, or swim the Flood, And make his vap'ring Promise good, Or, spite of all his Scoffs and Jeers, He, Sauce and all, should eat the Pears. The Priest, who Belly dearly lov'd, At this Reproach was strangely mov'd; Yet his unhappy case was such, He hated Danger full as much. At Disappointment sore dejected, He sadly on the Pears reflected: He was by Word and Honour bound To stand to't, and maintain his Ground. And now the Pears so lovely grew, That Water from both ends they drew. He therefore all his cunning bent To find out some Expedient, To prove himself this once mistaken, And save his Credit and his Bacon. Inward he turn'd his sullen Looks, And romaging o'er all his Books, He met an antient Convocation, That furnish'd him with an Evasion. Quoth he, they cou'd not be my due, Nor might I seize 'em till I knew, And Providence had time to prove, This heap of Pears was Treasure trouve: But now I plainly understand, They truly are a Deodand; And he that Abdicates 'em here, Has lost all Title to one Pear. And I should be a Fool no Doubt, Shou'd I stand any longer out. As for the Stain I cast on these, My self can wipe it off with ease. Fab. XVII. The Owl and the Bat. A fierce Dispute 'twixt Birds of Night Arose about their Gifts, and Light; The Owl and Bat aloud contended, Which was by Nature best befriended, Wrangling with clamorous Contest Which saw the clearest, and the best; Till from high Words, and angry Speeches, They came to Personal Reproaches. Quoth Madge, insulting o'er the Bat, What wou'd this Flitter-Mouse be at? Thou Mungrel Vermine art at most, And but half Bird thy self canst boast. The Bat reply'd with Indignation, Make to your self the Application; You're some Beast's Bastard it appears, As I'll demonstrate by your Ears. But what this is to our Dispute; If I am Vermine, you're a Brute. Then let's agree, the Owl reply'd, And by the Sun our Cause be try'd. A Nightingale that hard by sate, Thus undertook to Arbitrate: How shall the Sun decide your Case, When neither can endure his Face? You've said enough of Bats and Owls, To prove both purblind Knaves and Fools. The Bats, and Owls of Pinners-Hall, This Fable may apply; These Night-Birds representing all The Pastors and their Fry. If any wou'd know whom they fit, Their Controversies read; And see how oft the Sticks are split, To break each other's Head. But let 'em not the Truth come near, Nor venture into Light; For he that does bare-fac'd appear, Will shew a Hypocrite. While they against each other bawl, They the whole World convince, And plainly shew their want to all Of Faith, as well as Sense. Fab. XVIII. The Sharpers and Cullies. Two Sharpers once to Gaming fell, In a large Company; And manag'd their Intrigue so well, They drew in Standers by. They wrangled, quarrel'd, and call'd names; And play'd with so much heat; That no one jealous of a sham, Suspected 'twas a Cheat. But when the Gamesters num'rous grew, And store of Cullies came; Each from the other took his Cue, To manage right his Game. A long time doubtful was the Scale, The Odds uncertain were; For they do all by turns prevail, And none great Losers are. Till e'ery one at length was dipt, And mighty Sums were laid; The wink one of the Jugglers tipt, And so the Cheat betray'd. But this Discovery came to late, For now the Game was won; An empty Pocket was their Fate, And all the Fools undone. Ex???quer, B?nk, and the Exchange, East-Indians Old, and New, And all the World this very Game, Too busily pursue. Notes, Bills and Stock, and Actions fall, Or without Reason rise; Just as the Jugglers at Wh???hall, Or M??cer's Chappel please. The Great Ones have Sham-fallings out, To draw the Lesser in; But the true Quarrel is, not who, But how much each shall win. And when the small Ones give their Voice, Who shall be most Empowr'd; They have but Liberty of Choice, By whom they'l be devour'd. Fab. XIX. The Wolf and Dog. A Half famisht Wolf met a jolly fat Dog, That was let out for Air, and freed from the Clog. Quoth Isgrim, Friend Towzer, thou hast what I lack, How com'st thou by all this good Flesh on thy back? Says Towzer, I lodg, and am fed at Wh???hall; I live like a Prince, and do nothing but bawl. You live like a Felon, by paltry Sheep-stealing; But if you'l be rul'd, and use double-dealing, I'l help you to mighty Preferment at C??rt, And you shall pay nothing but Flattery for't. Quoth Isgrim, I like the Conditions so well, I long till I'm there, for I soon shou'd excel; I can cringe like a Beau, and humour My Lord, And praise e'ery foppish Nonsensical word. 'Tis enough says the Cur; so onward they jog'd, Till Towzer, who often was collar'd and clog'd, Like a Cur of good Manners in bowing betray'd The Ring on his Neck, which the Collar had made. Says the crafty sly Wolf, in that Circle some Spell I suppose is contain'd, by which you live well. 'Tis only, says Towzer, ne'er mind it I pray, Some loose hair my Collar has fretted away. Says Isgrim, I owe you, Sir, thanks for this grace; But if there's a Collar, that alters the case. I'll purchase my Place by no such submission, But forage the Woods, and not alter Condition. The Wealth, and the Power of great Places please all, Who wou'd shun the Fatigue they're encumber'd withal. They wou'd have the Profit without the Attendance, And shift off the burden of slavish dependance. But here they may see by the Wolf, and the Dog, They that will have the Fat, must submit to the Clog. Fab. XX. Of the Apple and the Horse-Turd. An Apple falling from a Tree Which near a River stood, With Horse-Turd in his Company Was sailing down the Flood: When Turd, ambitious to discourse A thing so much above it, Would into Conversation force, As down the River drove it. Lord! Madam, what a pleasant Stream Is this in which we ride? Sister! How we two Apples swim? The foul Sirrev'rence cry'd. A Thredbare Writer, who perchance Has not one Farthing paid, To carry on the War with France, Towards the Royal Aid; Crys, Damn this curs'd confounded Peace, It Forty Millions cost, And we could not procure our Ease Till all our Wealth was lost. Fab. XXI. The Pump. A Welsh-man (from his Hills come down) Saw a strange Engine near a Town; A high erected Post there stood, Crown'd with a Janus head of Wood; One of whose Faces look'd to th'Country, T'other Phyz o'er the Town was Centry. A Clown close by gave 't many a thump, And told admiring Taffy 'twas a Pump: With this side I my Cellar drain and dry, With t'other I my Waters want supply, Here's all I have which in this Bowl stands by. Sot, quoth the Briton, why dost toil? Here's not a drop comes all this while. T'other strait pours the dish of Water Into the Pump. Thou mendst the matter, Cry'd Taffy laughing; why dost wast The Water thou already hast? Vext with his Ignorance, the Clown Replied, If ever thou hadst known How wiser Men can use a Tool, Thou wouldst not prate so like a Fool: I threw this Dishful in, thou silly Lout, Because I'm sure to get a Tubful out. No wonder some profusely give their Coin, 'Tis easie being liberal on design. Mony well plac'd at time of need we know, Tho sprinkled but by P?, makes M? flow. Fab. XXII. Of the Bear and the Bees. Cold Muscovy (as story tells) Fam'd is for store of Bears; That it in Honey too excels, From the same Books appears. There's scarce a hollow Tree that grows, When cut, but Honey from it flows. A plundering Bear about did roam, To many a hollow Oak he troop'd, Greedy he was, oft chang'd his home, As oft the pillag'd Trees he scoop'd: The Witless Bees saw him devour Their Summers toils, and Winter-store; Call'd it perhaps Protecting too, Lest other Beasts the like should do, And seem'd to be content. At length when he enlarg'd his rounds, (For Rapine scarce knows any bounds) To a Farm-house he went. The Bear his wonted raving drives, To run a muck at all the Hives. The Bees who had with patience born The rifling of the Forest round; Enrag'd, their All was from them torn, And that their last retreat he found; With Indignation rose in swarms, With one consent all flew to Arms, And all assail'd the Bear: In numerous clusters round they hung; Never was prowling Beast so stung, As he was every where. Vast Numbers gor'd his tender Snout, Some his two shining Favourite Eyes: He rages, storms, and cuffs about, Both mad and blind to shun them trys: Among the rest there's none attack'd him more Than e'en those Drones who snack'd with him before. In vain for Aid he roars and bawls. In vain his kindred Cubs he calls; The Floods and Woods that interpose, Keep all things from him but his Foes. Till torn, and bloody, thro the Bogs he flys, And by those Insects he cou'd once despise, Raving, and venom'd, for his Rapine dies. Whoever D 'Alva like essays To use oppressing Means and Ways Will find the Consequence but bad; Oppression all things overrules, Not only raises swarms of Fools, But makes a wise Man mad. Fab. XXIII. The Devil and the Priest. There was a Monarch, whose Imperial Sway Nations far distant did as Slaves obey: Kingdoms he govern'd, which he never saw, And made 'em stoop to his extended Law. Some Crowns by right of Birth he held, and some Beneath his Sway by right of Conquest come: So large his Awful Monarchy was grown, His Slaves at all times did behold the Sun. But Ah how weak is Pow'r and humane Sway! When we Eternal Orders must obey? That mighty King can ravish'd Kingdoms seize, Becomes a Slave to Sickness and Disease, And wasts in Bady, as his Crowns increase. Just were the Gods this Monarch to oppress, Who ruin'd Lands, and Nations did distress. Millions of murder'd Ghosts surround his Throne, Whose Lands by Blood he'ad vilely made his own: Nature by day his drooping Soul afrights, And murder'd Ghosts disturb his Peace anights. Thus some vile Usurer of London Town, Who has whole Familys and Tribes undone, Widows and Orphans cramm'd into his Bags, Expos'd to cold in tatter'd Clothes and Rags; Whilst the vile Wretch Damnation worketh out, Upon his Couch tormented with the Gout. From Drugs this King could no assistance have, Nature nor Art could not the Monarch save From the cold Palace of a noisome Grave; By Heaven accurst, no Issue left to reign, He long had rul'd alas! but rul'd in vain: His wealthy Kingdoms now disown'd by Fate, Their Regal Line must meanly terminate: Gasping they lie to every neighb'ring Power, For every King is a Competitor; Each claims his Right to the extinguish'd Throne, Some would have part, but others all or none: One claims by Marriage what by t'other's given, But Father Pope claims by Decree of Heav'n. Thus mighty Feuds thro the Horizon spread, And promise Wars when the sick Monarch's dead. What must be done in so deplor'd a case, When Fate appears with such an angry face? The Swords are whetting, and prepar'd's the Shield, And bloody Troops are entering the Field; When the whole World's just kindling in a Flame, E'en in the Nick the Priest and Devil came; Two great Composers of Intestine Jars, Who fill both Hell and Mony-Chests by Wars; Still leave the Slain confus'dly in the lurch, Whilst Hell gets all the Vot'ries of the Church: But such their fate, the Priesthood and Old Nick Approach the Royal Mansions of the Sick. They do not viler Words to Eve express, The first Queen Regent of the Universe, When their Advice she freely did embrace, And by it damn'd her self and all her Race, Than to the dying Monarch now they utter, And in his Ears Infernal Accents mutter. ‘Sir, says the Priest, you're ready to bequeath ‘The Lamp of Life unto the puff of Death; ‘Your Kingdoms totter, as your Life declines, ‘You are the last of all the Regal Lines. ‘I am by Heaven, and by the Pope design'd ‘T'instruct with Rules of Faith your Royal Mind. ‘If you expect in t'other World some ease, ‘Pray leave your Kingdoms in a settled Peace: ‘Such vast Pretensions to your Thrones are made, ‘As will the Earth with grizly Wars invade. Here did the dying King erect his head, And faintly to his Confessor thus said: ‘Thou knowest my Kingdoms do belong to one, ‘Who hath by Birth a Title to my Throne; ‘Tho not descended from these Loins of mine, ‘His Title is as good, as much Divine. ‘Ah! says the Priest, that Title can't be good, ‘Which is supported by the loss of Blood: ‘That Prince can never his just Rights maintain, ‘He is too weak, too poor for such a Reign. ‘He who by Marriage does a Right pretend, ‘Was still your sure and ever-faithful Friend. ‘Tho he his Right renounc'd, I do declare ‘You may by Will appoint him lawful Heir. And here the Devil whisp'ring in his Ear, The Priest proceeds: ‘If you my sacred Counsels now shall shun, ‘I'll tell your Majesty you are undone: ‘Your Sins are many, and must be forgiven ‘Before you can approach the Throne of Heaven; ‘And if you do not my Advice pursue, ‘I'll pardon none, and Hell shall be your due; ‘No extreme Unction, no anointing Oil ‘To save your Skin where wretched Sinners broil ‘In the hot Confines of the Stygian Lake, ‘Because they Priestly Counsels did forsake! ‘Where in large Bowls is liquid Sulphur quaff'd (At which damn'd Words the very Devil laugh'd.) ‘There you must lie tormented and forlorn, ‘No King in Tophet shall like you be torn: ‘I will more Torments on your Head denounce ‘Than you, when living, Scepters had and Crowns. ‘But if you will my Counsels now pursue, ‘No King in Heav'n shall be more blest than you, ‘With Treasures greater than those of Peru. ‘Nay when from earthly Body you are loose, ‘You shall not stop at the old half-way House, ‘Where Sinners take a Pot of Stygian Liquor ‘To make their sense of Torment far more quicker; ‘Where on hard Benches those dejected Elves ‘Do for vast Ages sit to louse themselves. ‘But you, when e'er your Majesty shall die, ‘Presto shall mount the Regions of the Sky, ‘And view your Kingdoms lessening as you fly. He said. The Prince afrighted at his words, To the vile Dictates of the Priest accords: He makes his Will, and gives those Crowns away, Which he, much envy'd, did so weakly sway, Unto a Prince, who could no Title have, But what Ambition and his Envy gave. Thus Kings are bubbl'd, who on Priests rely, They live in scandal, and unpitied die; Condemn'd to Bondage and base Fame below, And when they die, the Lord knows where they go. For Heaven is kind, if e'er a Fool it saves, Who trusts his Soul within the hands of Knaves. Spain henceforth of the Priests may have a care, And of their vile deluding Tricks beware. If Heav'n be just, as sure in time it will, Porto Carero shall his Crimes fulfil; He who embroils the World with Scenes of Wars, And Europe hurries in intestine Jars, Shall by the hand of Fate a Victim fall, And slip to Hell from off the Earthly Ball. Let England, Holland, Germany alone, See on the Wretch condign Justice done; Mean while let France go on to play its pranks, Whilst its vast River overflows its Banks. Glutted with Empire may all Tyrants die, And groveling in their Pride and Ruin lie: She may in time her dear Ambition mourn; Anjou, like Conti, may again return. And may no King from henceforth e'er be blest, Who trusts a Devil or a crafty Priest. Fab. XXIV. The Courtier. A milk-white Rogue Immortal and unhang'd, By Fate and Parliaments severely bang'd, Without a Saint, a Devil was within; He sought all Dangers, for he knew all Sin; Resolv'd for Grandure, and t'acquire Wealth, Rob'd some by force, and others trick'd by stealth; A wheedling, fawning, parsimonious Knave, The Prince's Favour he resolv'd to have. The only means by which he thought to rise, He shuffl'd Cards, and slily cog'd his Dice; A true State-Juggler, could make things appear Such as would please his Prince's Eyes or Ear; Produc'd false Lights his Monarch to mislead, Which made him from his Paths of Int'rest tread. He skreen'd all Villains from due course of Laws, And from his Prince his truest Subjects draws; Till angry Senates the vile Monster took, And from the Root the upstart Cedar shook, Squeez'd the curs'd Spunge had suck'd the Notion's Coin, And made him cast up what he did purloin: Then on a Gibbet did the Monster die, A Just Example to Posterity. Let Favorites beware how they abuse Their Princes Goodness, or the Peoples Laws; How they clandestine Methods ever use To propagate a base unrighteous Cause. The Prince's Favour, like a Horse untam'd, Dos often break the giddy Rider's Neck: On him who for Preferment's so much fam'd, The People oft their bloody Vengeance wreak. Let these beware how they mislead their Prince, Or rob the Treasure of a potent Nation, Or multiply enormous Crimes; for hence Comes Hanging oft, or noble Decollation. Fab. XXV. The Pilgrims. Religion is a thing, if understood, Would make men righteous and their Actions good For Piety alone of all things can Correct the Manners, and reform the Man: But Ah! how much is the blest Name abus'd, And by unhallow'd Lips profanely us'd! But none so much their Lewdness evidence, As those who to it make the most pretence. A Brace of Pilgrims, of a Sect severe, As e'er usurp'd a Place in Moses Chair, Men skill'd and read in Moses sacred Laws, Yet well instructed for an impious Cause. They brought up Pilgrims in their pious Schools, Where Men were hoodwink'd &amp; transform'd to Fools. They taught 'em Doctrines did e'en Sense deceive, And made 'em many holy Cheats believe; Passive Obedience taught in a free Nation, More foolish far than Transubstantiation. These pious Ramblers trudg'd from Post to Pillow, Got sacred Oak and consecrated Willow, Chips of our Saviour's Cross, which where they came Still got 'em Mony, Provender and Fame; Each holy Hocus Pocus had a trick Would cheat the wisest Subject of Old Nick. They wrought such Miracles in every Nation, As did inhance their holy Reputation. From Spain unto Aleppo they embark'd, As Beasts in Noah's wooden House were ark'd; From thence o'er sandy Desert they did travel, Where Men by Winds are buried oft in Gravel, Where Camels foundring in the sandy way, Are mummied up for ever and for ay; Where Men are thrust so far beneath the Ground, They scarce will hear the final Trumpet sound; Till thro the scorching Sand's impetuous Heat, They got safe to Jerusalem's beauteous Gate; Where when they came, just at the very entry, They saw a Brother Pilgrim standing Sentry, With meagre Looks, as if he'd been half roasted; But yet in Pilgrim Cant he them accosted: Says he, ‘You're welcome Brethren to this Place, ‘Of other Lands, and of our Church the Grace ‘Step you but in I'll show our Saviour's Tomb, ‘So much ador'd by all that hither come; ‘With all the holy Relicks of the Saints, ‘Which he who has not seen, true Fervour wants. ‘But e'er you enter, Brethren, I must tell ye, ‘We have got no Provision for the Belly. At which one Pilgrim said, ‘We need not that, ‘We without Victuals can grow plump and fat. Then putting Hand within his sacred Hood, Pull'd out a Piece of most ill-favour'd Wood. Said he, ‘Whoever bears this sacred Chip, ‘Needs not with Liquor ever wet his Lip, ‘Or cram his Guts as other Mortals do: ‘This is both Meat and Drink, and Clothing too. ‘We from Aleppo came, and all the way ‘Have neither eat nor drank by night or day, ‘Whilst others fainting, perish'd on the Road, ‘And Camels sunk beneath the Heat and Load. ‘Who e'er to Battel goes, that carries this, ‘Him shall the poyson'd Arrows ever miss: ‘He may in Tempests thro the largest Seas ‘Undrowned pass whenever he shall please. ‘This sacred Chip is of our Saviour's Cross, ‘Which who has got, can ne'er sustain a Loss. A Pilgrim Merchant standing by, o'er-heard What the Impostor said, and much afraid To pass the Deserts, but with needful Prop To keep his drooping Limbs and Spirits up; Offers the Pilgrims Mony for the VVood, VVho pond'ring seriously, a long time stood; Then in the Offer they were very nice, Not out of Zeal, but to inhance the Price: At length, which being rais'd ('tis very odd) They took the Mony, and they sold their God. The Merchant thus equipp'd, away he ran, He need not stay now for the Caravan; But in the Deserts was the Sot mistaken, Where he did broil and fry like any Bacon; He would have given in this very matter A Load of Timber for a draught of VVater: There in the Sands did unassisted roast, He curst the Pilgrims, and gave up the Ghost. To English Jacobites, beware How you this Merchant's paths do tread: If you are caught in such a Snare, And by Non-juring Priests misled, You may like him be famish'd quite, And die in Ditches like a Dog: When you are poor, they'l say good night; They get the Gold, and you the Log. For if you run into Extremes, And against Faith believe and hope, You are bedevil'd by King James, As he's bedevil'd by the Pope. For take my word, and to it I'll be sworn, Monmouth shall rise when James shall e'er return. Fab. XXVI. The Confederacy. 1. There was an Eagle built his Nest Upon a lofty Oak, Tho not above Th'avenging Stroke And Thunder of Almighty Jove; Of Jove, who sometimes thinks it best, For Reasons yet unknown, To let the vilest Men alone, To ravage all their Neighbours Lands, And murder Innocents with bloody hands. So he thought good To let this mighty ravenous Tyrant of the Wood Perch on his Boughs secure from Fate, And all the little winged Mortals eat. 2. Long there he liv'd, and every day descry'd From his exalted Boughs, All the low Underwood beside Beneath his Shadow grows. When e'er he saw the Flocks upon the wing, Or heard in Bushes the plum'd Creatures sing, His Eaglets he sent out To seize the Prey, Who fierce as Lightning flew about: Swifter than they No Arrow flies, Or Star from Azure Skies; No Tyger in the Forest tears The trembling Hind with greater rage To Pieces with his sharpen'd Paws, Than these the harmless Birds engage, And home return with bloody Beaks and Claws. 3. In vain the Birds did build their Nest, In vain did young ones breed, When Old and Young were but a Prey at best To this curs'd Eagle's Seed. Hopeless of better fate They pensive sate, And did the dangers of their Tribes relate. Till one much wiser than the rest, To th'harmonious Croud in Notes himself exprest: ‘See, Brethren dear, ‘We who are born as free as Air, ‘Confin'd by nothing but the Sky ‘When we aloft do fly, ‘And when we downwards go ‘By nothing but the mighty Earth below. ‘But vain our Freedoms are, ‘Our native Birthright to the spacious Air, ‘If this Tyrannic Eagle be empower'd ‘By Fate to kill, ‘And make us Captives at his Will; ‘And we are born by him to be devour'd. ‘'Tis true (tho not to our disgrace) ‘We are the weakest of the feather'd Race: ‘The Gods have us no Talons giv'n, ‘Such the Decree of Heaven. ‘We can't contend with mighty Powers, ‘Our business is to sit in Bow'rs, ‘And in our natural Accents sing ‘The Glories of the Spring. ‘We are but Cantons of the Air, ‘Some mighty Emp'rors are; ‘If we with these are in Alliance join'd, ‘The Eagle soon will find ‘Himself o'ermatch'd, ‘And we shall have our Young in safety hatch'd. ‘Therefore let us persuade ‘These Potentates unto our Aid: ‘We'll get Provision from the Wood ‘Their Forces to maintain, ‘Whilst they upon the Plain ‘Do combat for the Common good. 4. He said, and to his wise Intent The feather'd Company Did all agree; They clapt their Wings, and chirping gave consent. The Hawks of every kind In the Alliance join'd, The Ravens, Crows, and all the Breed That do on slaughter'd Bodies feed; Each one who did a Talon wear, His sharpen'd Weapon did prepare, He whet his Beak, and hasten'd to the War. Which when the Eagle understood, He armed all his Bands, And to the Field commands His vet'rane Troops long since inur'd to Blood. Such Preparations ne'er were known, Such mighty Actions ne'er were done By the Inhabitants of the Air, Or such a bloody War. 5. For now the fatal Day is come, Little inferiour to the Day of Doom, Over a spacious Plain, On which below Small Furz and Fern did grow: Now Death and vast Destruction reign: Here in the Air The Combatants begin the War; Who as they in Battalia fly, Put out the very Candle of the Sky: Such sparring Blows they gave, the very Sound Echo'd from hollow Caverns of the Ground; At e'ery Stroke Was some strong Talon broke, Some Beak was spoil'd, Or Hawk or Eagle kill'd: The Feathers fell like Showers of Snow Upon the Plain below, The Battel was uncertain, still They both did one another kill, Until the Eagles Forces broke, Retreated to the Fortress of their Oak. 6. The Eagle thus distrest, His Warriors spoil'd both in their Beak and Crest, His Fortunes growing worse and worse, To Policy he has recourse; This firm Alliance he must break, Or else his Oaken Throne must crack. First from the common Cause He the fierce Vultur draws, Which was by Wedding done; A Young Hen-Vultur of a comely Grace, The only Princess of the Race, To a Cock-Grandson-Eagle of his own. Then with his other Foes he gets a Peace, And thus all Feuds and Discord cease. No sooner were his Pinions grown, And Claws made sharp, but from his Throne He War proclaims, And all the little Flocks of Birds he damns, And all Alliances he scorns, And a true Tyrant Eagle turns. If e'er Confederates agen Shall the French Eagle overcome, Ne'er let him rise to fight, but then Give him his ne plus ultra Doom. In him no Faith nor Honesty they'l find, Whom neither Gods nor human Laws can bind. Fab. XXVII. The Lions Treaty of Partition. A mighty Lion heretofore, Of monstrous Paws, and dreadful Roar, Was bent upon a Chase: Inviting Friends, and near Allies, Frankly to share the Sport and Prize. During the hunting Space, The Lynx, and Royal Panther came, The Boar and Wolf of Wolfingham, The Articles were these: Share and share like, whate'er they got, The Dividend upon the spot, And so depart in peace. A Royal Hart, delicious Meat! Destin'd by inauspicious Fate, Was started for the Game; The Hunters run him one and all, The Chase was long, and at the fall Each enter'd with his Claim. One lov'd a Hanch, and one a Side, This eat it powder'd, t'other dry'd, Each for his share alone: Old Grey-beard then began to roar, His Whiskers twirl'd, bully'd and swore, The Hart was all his own. And thus I prove my Title good, My Friend deceas'd sprung from our Blood, Half's mine as we're ally'd: My Valour claims the other part; In short I love a hunted Hart, And now who dares divide? The bilk'd Confederates they stare, And cry'd, Old Gentleman deal fair, For once be Just and True. Quoth he, and looking wondrous grum, Behold my Paws, the word is Mum, And so Messieurs adieu. Tyrants can only be restrain'd by Might, Power's their Conscience, and the Sword their Right: Allies their Court to compass private ends, But at the Dividend disclaim their Friends, Yet boast not France of thy successful Fraud, Maintain'd by Blood, a Torment whiist enjoy'd: Imperial Cæsar drives the Storm along, And Nassau's Arms avenge the publick Wrong. Fab. XXVIII. The Blind Woman and her Doctors. A wealthy Matron now grown old Was weak in e'ery part; Afflicted sore with Rhumes and Cold, Yet pretty sound at Heart. But most her Eyes began to fail, Depriv'd of needful light: Nor cou'd her Spectacles avail To rectify their Sight. Receipts she try'd, she Doctors fee'd, And spar'd for no Advice Of Men of Skill, or Quacks for need That practise on sore Eyes. Salves they dawb'd on, and Plaisters both, And this, and that was done: Then Flannels, and a Forehead-cloth, To bind and keep them on. Her House, tho small, was furnish'd neat, And e'ery Room did shine With Pictures, Tapestry, and Plate, All Rich, and wondrous fine. Whilst they kept blind the silly Soul, Their hands found work enough, They pilfer'd Plate, and Goods they stole, Till all was carry'd off. When they undamm'd their Patients Eyes, And now pray how's your Sight? Crys t'other, this was my advice, I knew 'twou'd set you right. Like a stuck Pig the Woman star'd, And up and down she run: With naked House, and Walls, quite scar'd, She found her self undone. Doctors, quoth she, your Cure's my pain, For what are Eyes to me? Bring Salves and Forehead-Cloths again, I've nothing left to see. See injur'd Britain thy unhappy Case, Thou Patient with distemper'd Eyes: State Quacks but nourish the Disease, And thrive by Treacherous Advice. If fond of the Expensive Pain, When eighteen Millions run on Score: Let them clap Mufflers on again, And physick Thee of Eighteen more. Fab. XXIX. The Satyrs Address. Five Satyrs of the Woodland Sort, Thought Politicians then: Their Ears prick'd up, their Noses short, And Brows adorn'd like Aldermen; With Asses Hoofs, great gogle Eyes, And ample Chins of Be?ms Size: To Jove tript up with an Address, In favour of the Plains: That it wou'd please him to suppress All Heats and Colds, his Winds and Rains; The Sun that he'd extinguish too, And in the Skies hang something new. My wise reforming Friends, quoth Jove, Our Elements are good! We manage for the best above, Tho not so rightly understood; But since such profound Squires are sent, We'l treat you like the Cream of Kent. Then Jove brought out Æthereal Fire In a gilt Chafindish: The sparkling Flame they all admire, 'Twas fine, they vow'd, as Heart cou'd wish; They gap'd, they grin'd, they jump'd about; Jove give us that, the Sun put out! The charming Flames they all embrace, Which urg'd by Nature's Laws, Their shaggy Hides set in a blaze, And soundly sing'd their Paws; In Corners then they sneak, with Terror dumb, And o'er th'Immortal Pavements scud it home. How senseless are our Modern Whiggish Tools, Beneath the dignity of British Fools! With Beef resolv'd, and fortify'd with Ale, They censure Monarchs, and at Senates rail; So eagerly to Publick Mischief run, That they prevent the Hands which loo them on. O true Machines; and Heads devoid of Brains! Affront that Senate which your Rights maintains! Thus Ideots sport with Power, and Flames embrace, Till smarting Folly glares them in the Face. Fab. XXX. The Farmer and his Dog. There dwelt a Farmer in the West, As we're in story told; Whose Herds were large, and Flocks the best That ever lin'd a Fold. Arm'd with a Staff, his Russet Coat, And Towser by his side; Early and late he tun'd his Throat, And every Wolf defi'd. Lov'd Towser was his Heart's delight, In Cringe and Fawning skill'd: Entrusted with the Flocks by Night, And Guardian of the Field. Towser, quoth he, I'm for a Fair, Be Regent in my Room: Pray of my tender Flocks take care, And keep all safe at home. I know thee Watchful, Just, and Brave, Right worthy such a place: No wily Fox shall thee deceive, Nor Wolf dare show his face. But ne'er did Wolves a Fold infest, At Regent Towser's rate: He din'd and sup'd upon the best, And frequent Breakfasts eat. The Farmer oft receiv'd advice, And laugh'd at the Report: But coming on him by surprise, Just found him at the sport. Ungrateful Beast, quoth he, what means That bloody Mouth and Paws? I know the Base, the Treacherons Stains, Thy breach of Trust and Laws. The Fruits of my past Love I see, Roger the Halter bring: E'en truss him on that Pippin Tree, And let Friend Towser swing. I'll spare the famish'd Wolf and Fox, That ne'er my Bounty knew: But as the Guardian of my Flocks, This Neckcloth is your due. When Ministers their Prince abuse, And on the Subjects prey: With antient Monarchs 'twas in use, To send them Towser's way. A Copy of Verses written in the Year 1623. relating to many things that would happen to the Government of England. And since Men wandring in a Wood by Night, When they shall through a Glade behold some Light, Take thereby Courage to walk chearly on, In hope their Fears and Toils are nearly gone; I'll from a Cloud flash out a little Gleam Of Lightning, and disclose a little Beam, Whereby on you a Glimmering shall be cast Of what you may attain to at the last. For I will shew you by what Pedegree That Government to you deriv'd shall be, Which will at last the British Islands bless With Inward Peace and Outward Happiness: It was of late a brief Presage of his Who oft hath Truth foretold, and it is this. When here a K. Charles I. Scot shall think his Throne to set Above the Circle of a British King, He shall a The long Parliament. Dateless Parliament beget, From whence The Army. a Dreadful Armed Brood shall spring. This Offspring shall beget a wild Confusion; Confusion shall an K. Charles's Death. Anarchy beget, That Anarchy shall bring forth in Conclusion A Ol. Cromwel L. Protector. Creature that you have no Name for yet. This Creature shall conceive a sickly State, Which will an When Rich. Cromwel was deposed. Aristocracy produce: The many-headed Beast, not liking that, To raise Democracy shall rather choose. And then Democracy's Production shall A The Committee of Safety. Moon-calf be, which some a Mole do call; A false Conception of imperfect Nature, And of a shapeless and a brutish Feature. For these Descents shall live and reign together, So acting for a while, that few should know Which of them has the Sov'reignty, or whether There be among them a Supreme or no. When they with Jars and Janglings have defac'd Your Government of King, Lords, and Commons. Triple Building, and themselves nigh worn Into Contempt, they of one Cup shall tast, And into their first Elements return. Five of them shall subdue the other Five; And then those Five shall, in a doubtful Strife, Each others Death so happily contrive, That they shall die to live a better Life; And out of their Corruption rise there shall A K. Charles the Second. true Supreme, acknowledged by all: In whom the Power of all the Five shall be, With Unity, made visible in Three. Prince, People, Parliament, with Priests and Peers, Shall be a while your emulous Grandees, Make a confused Pentarchy some Years, And leave off their distinct Claims by degrees. And then shall Righteousness ascend the Throne, Then Truth and Love and Peace re-enter shall, Then Faith and Reason shall agree in one, And all the Virtues to their Council call. And timely out of all these shall arise That Kingdom and that happy Government, Which is the Scope of all those Prophecies That future Truths obscurely represent. But how this done shall be, few Men shall see; For wrought in Clouds and Darkness it will be: And e'er it come to pass to publick View, Most of these following Signs must first ensue. A King shall willingly himself unking, And thereby grow far greater than before, The Priests their Priesthood to Contempt shall bring, And Piety thereby shall thrive the more. A Parliament it self shall overthrow, And thereby shall a better Being gain. The Peers, by setting of themselves below, A more ennobling Honour shall obtain. The People for a time shall be enslav'd; But that shall make them for the future free, By private Loss the Publick shall be sav'd. An Army shall, by yielding, Victor be. The Cities Wealth her Poverty shall cause. The Laws Corruption shall reform the Laws. And Bullocks of the largest Northern Breed Shall fatted be where now scarce Sheep can feed. You may perhaps deride what's here recited, As heretofore you other Truths have slighted; But some of my Presage you have beheld Already in obscurity fulfill'd: The rest shall in its time appointed come, And sooner than will pleasing be to some. The last nine Signs or Symptoms of the ten, Which should precede them, shall appear to men Of all Conditions; but our Author saith, The first is but in Hope, not yet in Faith, And may be, or not be; for so or so That King shall have his Lot as he shall do. If all his Sins he heartily repent, God will remit e'en all his Punishment, And him unto his Peoples Hearts restore, With greater Honour than he had before. If he remain impenitent like Saul, God from the Throne shall cast both him and all His whole Descent, and leave him not a Man To fill it, though he had a Jonathan. If Ahab-like his Mourning has respects To temporary Losses or Effects, Like Ahab then it therewithal shall carry Some Benefit, which is but temporary. A real Penitence, tho somewhat late, The Rigor of his Doom may much abate, By leaving him a part of what he had, When he a Forfeiture of all hath made; Or else by rooting out those who in Sin With him have actually Partakers been; And placing in their steads a Branch of his, Whose Innocency no way question'd is. Another Copy of Verses by the same Author, written in 1628. God hath a Controversy with our Land, And in an evil plight Affairs do stand: And tho we always smart for doing ill, Yet God's Almighty Hand afflicts us still; And many see it not, for many be So wilful that his Hand they will not see. Some plainly view the same, but nothing care. Some at the sight thereof amazed are, Like Belteshazzar have a trembling Heart, But will not from their Wickedness depart. Some dream that all things do by Chance succeed, And that I prate more of them than I need. But Heaven and Earth to witness I invoke, That nothing causelesly I here have spoke. If this, O sickly Island! thou believe, And for thy great Infirmities shalt grieve, And knowing of thy Follies, make Confessions, And then bewail thine infinite Transgressions, And then amend those Errors; God shall then Thy manifold Distempers cure again, Make all thy Scarlet Sins as white as Snow, And cast thy threatned Judgment on thy Foe. But if thou, fondly thinking thou art well, Shalt slight this Message which my Muse doth tell, And scorn her Counsel; if thou shalt not rue Thy former ways, but frowardly pursue Thy wilful Course, then hark what I am bold (In spite of all thy Madness) to unfold: For I will tell thy Fortune, which when they That are unborn shall read another day, They shall believe God's Mercy did infuse Thy Poet's Breast with a Prophetick Muse; And know that he this Author did prefer, To be, from him, this Isle's Remembrancer. —This Land shall breed a nasty Generation, Unworthy either of the Reputation Or Name of Men; for they, as Lice, shall feed E'en on the Body whence they did proceed. There shall moreover Swarms of divers Flies Engendred be in thy Prosperities, To be a Plague, and still are humming so, As if they meant some weighty Work to do; Whereas upon the common Stock they spend, And nought perform of what they do pretend. Then shall Popery. a Darkness follow, far more black Than when the Light Corporeal thou dost lack. For grossest Ignorance, o'ershadowing all, Shall in so thick a Darkness thee enthral, That thou a blockish People shalt be made, Still wandring on in a deceiving Shade; Mistrusting those that safest Paths are shewing, Most trusting them who counsel thy undoing; And aye tormented be with Doubts and Fears, As one who Outcries in dark places hears. Nor shall the Hand of God from thee return, Till he hath also smote thine Eldest Born; That is, till he hath taken from thee quite Ev'n that whereon thou sett'st thy whole delight; And filled every House throughout the Nation, With Deaths unlooked for, and Lamentation. So great shall be thy Ruin and thy Shame, That when thy Neighbouring Kingdoms hear the same, Their Ears shall tingle; and when that Day comes, In which thy Follies must receive their Dooms; A day of Clouds, a day of Gloominess, A day of black Despair and Heaviness It will appear; and then thy Vanities, Thy Gold and Silver, thy Confederacies, And all those Reeds on which thou hast depended, Will fail thy Trust, and leave thee unbefriended. Thy King, thy Priests, and Prophets then shall mourn, And peradventure feignedly return, To beg of God to succour them; but they Who will not hearken to his Voice to day, Shall cry unheeded, and he will despise Their Vows, their Prayers, and their Sacrifice. A Sea of Troubles all thy Hopes shall swallow; As Wave on Wave, so Plague on Plague shall follow And every thing that was a Blessing to thee, Shall turn to be a Curse to help undo thee. And when thy Sin is fully ripe in thee, Thy Prince and People then alike shall be; Thou shalt have Babes to be thy Kings, or worse, Those Tyrants who by Cruelty and Force Shall take away the antient Charters quite From all their Subjects, yea, themselves delight In their Vexation; and all those that are Made Slaves thereby shall murmur, yet not dare To stir against them. By degrees they shall Deprive thee of thy Patrimonials all; Compel thee, as in other Lands this day, For thine own Meat and thine own Drink to pay; And at the last begin to exercise Upon thy Sons all Heathenish Tyrannies, As just Prerogatives: To these Intents Thy Nobles shall become their Instruments. For they who had their Births from noble Races, Shall some and some be brought into Disgraces; From Offices they shall excluded stand, And all their virtuous Offspring from the Land Shall quite be worn: Instead of whom shall rise A Brood advanced by Impieties, That seek how they more great and strong may grow, By compassing the Publick Overthrow. These shall abuse thy Kings with Tales and Lies, With seeming Love and servile Flatteries; They shall persuade them, they have Power to make Their Wills their Law, and as they please to take Their Peoples Goods, their Children and their Lives, Ev'n by their just and due Prerogatives. When thus much they have made them to believe, Then they shall teach them Practices to grieve Their Subjects by, and Instruments become To help the screwing up by some and some Of Monarchies to Tyrannies: They shall Abuse Religion, Honesty and all; To compass their Designs they shall devise Strange Projects, and with Impudence and Lies Proceed in setling them; they shall forget Those reverend Usages which do befit The Majesty of State, and rail and storm, When they pretend Disorders to reform In their High Councils; and where Men should have Kind Admonitions, and Reprovings grave; When they offend they shall be threatned there, And scoft and taunted, tho no Cause appear. Whatever from thy People they can tear, Or borrow, they shall keep, as if it were A Prize which had been taken from the Foe, And they shall make no Conscience what they do To prejudice Posterity; for they, To gain their Lusts but for the present day, Shall with such Love unto themselves endeavour, That tho they know it will undo for ever Their own Posterity, it shall not make These Monsters any better Course to take. Nay God shall give them up, for their Offences, To such uncomely reprobated Senses, And blind them so, that when the Ax they see E'en hewing at the Root of their own Tree, By their own handy Strokes, they shall not grieve For their approaching Fall; no, nor believe Their Fall approacheth, nor assume that heed Which might prevent it, till they fall indeed. Mark well, O Britain! what I now shall say, And do not slightly pass these Words away; But be assured, that when God begins To bring this Vengeance on thee for thy Sins, Which hazard will thy total Overthrow, Thy Prophets and thy Priests shall slily sow The Seeds of that Dissension and Sedition, Which Time will ripen for thy sad Perdition; But not unless the Priests thereto consent: For in those days shall few Men innocent Be griev'd through any Quarter of the Land, In which thy Clergy shall not have some hand. Thy Cities and thy Palaces, wherein Most Neatness and Magnificence hath been, Shall heaps of Rubbish be.— Instead of Lions Tyrants thou shalt breed, Who nor of Law nor Conscience shall take heed; But on the weak Man's Portion lay their Paw, And make their Pleasures to become their Law. Thy Judges wilfully shall wrest the Laws, And, to the Ruin of the common Cause, Shall misinterpret them, in hope of Grace From those who might despoil them of their Place. Yea, that whereto they are obliged both By Conscience, by their Calling, and their Oath, To put in Execution they shall fear, And leave them helpless who oppressed are. A Panegyrick upon Oates. Of all the Grain our Nation yields In Orchards, Gardens, or in Fields, There is a Grain, which, tho 'tis common, Its Worth till now was known to no man. Not Ceres Sickle e'er did crop A Grain with Ears of greater hope: And yet this Grain (as all must own) To Grooms, and Hostlers well is known; And often has without disdain In musty Barn and Manger lain: As if it had been only good To be for Birds, and Beasts the Food. But now by new inspired Force It keeps alive both Man, and Horse. Then speak my Muse, for now I guess E'en what it is thou wouldst express: It is not Barley, Rye, nor Wheat, That can pretend to do the Feat: Tis Oates, bare Oates, that is become The Health of England, Bane of Rome, And Wonder of all Christendom. And therefore Oates has well deserv'd To be from musty Barn prefer'd, And now in Royal Court preserv'd. That like Hesperian Fruit Oates may Be watch'd and guarded Night and Day, Which is but just retaliation For having guarded a whole Nation. Hence e'ery lofty Plant that stands 'Twixt Berwick Walls, and Dover Sands, The Oak it self (which well we stile The Pride, and Glory of our Isle) Must strike and wave its lofty Head, And now salute an Oaten Reed. For surely Oates deserves to be, Exalted far 'bove any Tree. Th'Ægyptians once (tho it seems odd) Did worship Onions for their God: And poor Peelgarlic was with them Esteem'd beyond the richest Gem. What would they then have done, think ye, Had they but had such Oates as we, Oates of such known Divinity? Since then such good by Oates we find, Let Oates at least be now enshrin'd; Or in some Sacred Press inclos'd, Be only kept to be expos'd; And all fond Relicks else shall be Deem'd Objects of Idolatry. Popelings may tell us how they saw Their Garnet pictur'd on a Straw. 'Twas a great Miracle we know, To see him drawn in little so: But on an Oaten Stalk there is, A greater Miracle than this; A Visage which, with comly Grace, Did twenty Garnets now outface: Nay, to the Wonder to add more, Declares unheard-of things before; And thousand Myst'ries does unfold, As plain as Oracles of old: By which we steer Affairs of State, And stave off Britain's sullen Fate. Let's then in Honour of the Name Of OATES, enact some Solemn Game, Where Oaten Pipe shall us inspire Beyond the Charms of Orpheus Lyre. Stones, Stocks, and e'ery senseless thing To Oates shall dance, to Oates shall sing, Whilst Woods amaz'd to th'Ecchoes ring. And that this Hero's Name may not, When they are rotten, be forgot, W'll hang Atchievements o'er their Dust, A Debt we owe to Merits just. So if Deserts of Oates we prize, Let Oates still hang before our eyes, Thereby to raise our Contemplation; Oates being to this happy Nation A Mystick Emblem of Salvation. [In Parem imperium habet Par] Roundhead, 1 In Parem imperium habet Par, Vi &amp; armis we will bring Peers to the Bar, For 500 absolute Kings we are. 2 The Speaker Pope-like is servus servorum, Both make their Electors fall down before 'um, And pay excessive Fees when they adore 'um, 3 For Papal Power we care not a Louse, We are the sole infallible House, Whom God made a Man, we can soon make a Mouse. 4 If a Cavalier strikes Jack-Presbyter's Cur For biting his Heels, we'l hector you Sir; Seize him Serjeant at Arms. He dares not stir. 5 Know Phillips and Stavell, late Heads of a Jury, The Commons assembled cannot endure ye For putting the House in a very great Fury: 6 We've voted you both the Sons of Perdition, For abhorring the Subjects Right to Petition, And make you pray and pay for Remission. Cavalier. 7 I will be loyal to good Charles the Second; If this amongst my Errors be reckon'd, Be it known to the House I'll venture my Neck on't. 8 I highly prize the Petition of Right, And for Magna Charta to Death I will fight, But not against the King by this Light. 9 A Petition offer'd doth honour the King, Under God it speaks him the Sovereign Spring; 'Tis the Manner I blame distinct from the Thing. 10 Infallibility, I do declare, I cannot subscribe to; Wi. William's Chair, As I will not be rude to't, I'll not worship there. 11 I value Cæsar's Smile and his Nod; And if he whip me, I'll kiss the Rod, For Heaven's Vicegerent is an Earthly God. 12 The Commons I grant have a very great Charter, But not the power to Hang, Draw, and Quarter, To prevent which St. Charles dy'd a Martyr. 13 I confess I never knew till this Hour; That the Commons had a Satanical Power; For the Serjeant walks seeking whom to devour. 14 I own the House an Assembly most awful, But should they vote Alewives to fill Pots but half-full, Will it presently follow that Cheating is Lawful? 15 Or if they vote a Buzzard no Bird, Or that a Sirreverence is not a Turd; I'll acquiesce if it stinks not when stir'd. 16 The King I resolve to venture my Life for, Against such as seek to make him a Cypher, And by his leave, my Lawful Right strive for. 17 The Rump-Saints lull us asleep with their Charms, And make us new Prisons to keep us from harms, Where Topham's both Jaylor and Serjeant at Arms. 18 If this be the present Commons Intention, They need not so far to strain their Invention; All's done by a Bill of Comprehension. 19 When for no crime I great Fees disburse To the Serjeant at Arms, 'tis no better nor worse Than the Highway Law, Deliver your Purse. 20 At this rate standing up for Freedom, The King's Subjects neither value nor need 'um; 'Twere well if they sent a Surgeon to bleed 'um. 21 When Charles commended the state of Tangier, The House like deaf Adders stopped their Ear; Because the King mov'd it, they resolv'd not to hear. 22 But when a 2d or 3d Message was sent, They remonstrance at large how things at home went; And mov'd for a Fast. God grant they repent. Song. [What the Priests Gospel call] 1 What the Priests Gospel call Doth not move us at all, We Commons will have the Dominion; Whatsoe'er St. Paul taught Of Subjection, we vote, Is but one Doctor's Opinion. 2 Since James does not merit After Charles to inherit, And hates the Saints new Reformation; We'll be rul'd by the Devil, And do what is Evil, That Good may thence come to the Nation. 3 We are taught by St. Peter, To submit; but 'tis sweeter, To rule as his Successors tell us: Let the Church and State groan, We'll give Laws to the Throne, At least be his Majesty's Fellows. 4 What's Great Charles unto us? If he lets James undo us, We owe him no longer Subjection. Then Hugh doth afford Us the use of the Word, And appears for our Protection. 5 Let him lay York aside, Let Jack Presbyter ride, There's no other way to please us; Then to Charles we'll be true, As the Treacherous Jew To the innocent crucify'd Jesus. 6 Then 'twill quickly appear, That we value Tangier: And he need not make any Motion For Money or Men On that Score agen, All we have is at his devotion. The last Will and Testament of Anthony K. of Poland. My Tap is run; then Baxter, tell me why Shou'd not the good, the great Potapsky die? Grim Death, who lays us all upon our Backs, Instead of Scythe doth now advance his Ax; And I who all my Life in Broils hath spent, Intend at last to make a Settlement. Imprimis for my Soul (tho I had thought, To 've left that thing I never minded out) Some do advise for fear of doing wrong, To give it him to whom it doth belong. But I, who all Mankind have cheated, now Intend likewise to cheat the Devil too: Therefore I leave my Soul unto my Son, For he, as wise Men think, as yet has none. Then for my Polish Crown, that pretty thing, Let M?mouth take't, who longs to be a King; His empty Head soft Nature did design For such a Light and Airy Crown as mine. With my Estate I'll tell you how it stands, Jack Ketch must have my Clothes, the King my Lands. Item, I leave the damn'd Association To all the wise disturbers of the Nation; Not that I think they'l gain their ends thereby, But that they may be hang'd as well as I. A?ng, in Murders, and in Whorings skill'd, Who twenty Bastards gets for one Man kill'd, To thee I do bequeath my Brace of Whores, Long kept to draw the Humours from my Sores; For you they'l serve as well as Silver Tap, For Women give and sometimes cure a Clap. H?rd, my Partner in Captivity, False to thy God and King, but true to me; To thee some heinous Legacy I'd give, But that I think thou hast not long to live: Besides, thou'st wickedness enough in store To serve thy self, and twenty Thousand more. To thee, young G?y, I'll some small Toy present, For you with any thing can be content; Then take the Knife with which I cut my Corns, 'Twill serve to pare, and sharp your Lordship's Horns, That you may rampant M?mouth push, and gore, 'Till he shall leave your House, and change his Whore. On top of Monument let my Head stand It self a Monument, where first began The Flame that has endanger'd all the Land. But first to Titus let my Ears be thrown, For he 'tis thought will shortly lose his own. I leave old Baxter my invenom'd Teeth, To bite and poyson all the Bishops with. Item. I leave my Tongue to wise Lord N?th, To help him bring his what-de-call-ums forth; 'Twill make his Lordship utter Treason clear, And he in time may speak like Noble Peer. My squinting Eyes let Ignoramus wear, That they may this way look, and that way swear. Let the Cits take my Nose, because 'tis said, That by the Nose I them have always led; But for their Wives I nothing now can spare, For all my Life time they have had their share. Let not my Quarters stand on City Gate, Lest they new Sects and Factions do create; For certainly the Presbyterian Wenches, In Dirt will fall to idolize my Haunches: But that I may to my old Friend be Civil, Let some Witch make them Mummy for the Devil. To good K. Charles I leave (tho faith 'tis pity) A poison'd Nation, and deluded City; Seditions, Clamours, Murmurs, Jealousies, False Oaths, sham Stories, and religious Lies. There's one thing still which I had quite forgot, To him I leave the Carcase of my Plot; In a Consumption the poor thing doth lie, And when I'm gone 'twill pine away, and die. Let Jenkins in a Tub my Worth declare, And let my Life be writ by Harry Care. And if my Bowels in the Earth find room, Then let these Lines be writ upon their Tomb. Epitaph upon his Bowels. Ye Mortal Whigs, for Death prepare, For mighty Tapskies Guts lie here. Will his great Name keep sweet d'ye think? For certainly his Entrails stink. Alas! 'tis but a foolish Pride To outsin all Mankind beside, When such Illustrious Garbage must Be mingled with the common Dust. False Nature! that could thus delude The Cheater of the Multitude, That put his Thoughts upon the wing, And egg'd him on to be a King; See now to what an use she puts His Noble great and little Guts. Tapskie, who was a Man of Wit, Had Guts for other uses fit; Tho Fiddle-strings they might not be. (Because he hated Harmony) Yee for black Puddings they were good, Their Master did delight in Blood; Of this they should have drank their fill, (King Cyrus did not fare so ill) Poor Guts, could this have been your hap, Sh. Bethel might have got a Snap: But now at York his Guts must rumble, Since you into a hole did tumble. The Combat. The Argument. Nan and Frank, two quondam Friends, In which they'd both their private ends; Fell from Love to sudden Wrath, Much ado is 'twixt 'em both: Many a Rogue and Whore is call'd; But O brave Frank! the Whore is maul'd. Canto. Of Civil Dudgeon many a Bard Has sung, and Tales have oft been heard, Much in Verse and much in Prose, Of antient Friends grown arrant Foes. From this Occasion I'm about To tell you how two Friends fell out, The dearest Two, the kindest Pair, That e'er each others Heart did share, Damsel and Hero fat and fair. The Noble Hero, who not knows, Order attends where'er he goes; And in his even-dealing Hand, He always bears a pow'rful Wand, The Badg of Office and Command. Frequent at Lady W?s Door, 'Thas stood upon a well-known Score; Which the poor Jew Sir John has seen Full oft, and curs'd the Turk within. Who not admires the Damsel bright, That ever traps'd the Mall by Night; Who that ever had occasion For any Filthiness in Fashion, Many a Bed, and Basket full Has she put off of Trash and Trull. In short, their Virtues are well known, Where e'er her Trumpet Fame has blown; For long has mighty Clamour ran, Of honest Frank, and modest Nan. But how these two from harmless Prattle Came at last to direful Battel: Butler, couldst thou live agen, With thy inimitable Pen, 'Twould puzzle e'en thy mighty Verse The wondrous Actions to rehearse Of Knight and Damsel, that surpass Thy Trulla, and thy Hudibrass. There is a Time (as th'Author has it That writes the Treatise call'd the Gazette, In many things by him related) When Whitehall is evacuated: That is, when the Court and Prince are Catching Agues all at Windsor. For in Greenland, as they do write, The whole Year's but one Day and Night; So of late it has been here, Only Sunshine half the Year. And as evil Spirits venture, Often in the dark to enter Hallow'd Roofs, when those that keep The Place, are absent or asleep: So factious Vermin, that are driven From Court for Faults too oft forgiven; When they have watch'd the King from's House, Come there to keep their Rendevouz, Then Crofts and Sun?land Cabal, Then Ce??l lords it in the Mall, With all his train of unfledg'd Fools, Callow as they came from Schools; G?y, Mord?, Bran?, K?t, and Th?, Still at worst Follies deepest in. And Hunting—with his long Tool, Not as his mark of Man, but Fool: Whose Tail and Follies make his Life Useful only to his Wife. All these with foul Infection tainted, Long ago had been transplanted Far from the Court, that so the rest That yet were sound, might scape the Test. But as that vile Disease, the Itch, Does some lewd Natures so bewitch, That it they'l always choose to catch, For the meer Lechery to scratch; So Faction does with some prevail, For a bare Colour but to rail. Honest Frank was one of these, In's heart lov'd them, and their Disease: Honest Frank, who's but a Noddy, Yet rails as well as any Body, And as sacred Libels shew, Publish'd not many days ago, A certain Lord was but a Cur, To which Opinion few demur; So honest Frank, shou'd I speak mine, Is something nat'rally canine; For as some Cur his Master owns, To love, and give him Crusts and Bones, Tho kindly fed, will yet be running Abroad, where Carrion lies a sunning: So Frank, tho he no feeding need, On rotten Faction loves to feed; With which when he does back resort, He stinks intolerably at Court: And for Occasions of this nature, Has been of late no lazy Creature. Tho better, had he minded Duty, And so escap'd this War with Beauty; Beauty which shines in Nancies Face, As much as he does in his place. Majestick Wrinkles deck her Brow, And goodly glaring Eyes below, That still with Maudlin Kindness shine, The soft effects of Brandy Wine. Rich Carbuncles adorn her Nose, The envy of her sober Toes: And from her Lips Discourses fall, That make her welcome to Whitehall. Where one day she enter'd shining, Just as Frank was come from dining; But who the Devil could have guest, To see how they at first caress'd, How cheek by jowl they kindly walk'd, And with what tenderness they talk'd? My dearest Nan, said he, what Whores Are freshest now? Quoth Nan, my Doors Heav'n knows ne'er open'd to receive A Lover since you last took leave; Whom still to serve, my Love remains, Tho you ne'er pay me for my pains. Pay thee, quoth he! Nan pay for wenching! When e'en our Tables are retrenching. Says Nancy, O thou falsely fairest! 'Tis Love I want, not Coin, my dearest. 'Tis thee I love, 'tis thee I dote on, More than a Child that puts new Coat on; To see thee walk, I love thy Trip, I love the Drops upon thy Lip. Thy just Crevat, thy regular Wig, My little Pug, my little Pig. When with desire of thee I stretch, I've no Sciatica nor Stitch. Quoth Frank in rage, Avaunt you Bitch; Have I for this, through all my Life, Kept civil distance with my Wife; Studied new Speeches from Romances, And in my Age led Country-dances? Do I for this e'en at this Hour, Cheat e'ery Creature in my pow'r; Gripe from the Poor the utmost Farthing To keep my credit up at Carding? Do I for this affect a Grace, And paint my old John-Apple Face, Only to have a Bawd adore me? No, I'll have Virgins fall before me. Virgins! quoth Nan; and then she hung A Tongue out full two handfuls long, And with desire of Malice stung, Lick'd o'er the thickest painted place, And spoil'd intirely that days Face. But who can speak the Noise and Din, The Fury that did then begin; The Oaths, the Outcries, and the Blows, When Francis catching Nancy's Nose, With furious gripe expressing hate, Squeez'd nine large Insects off of that? Then with a shock upon her Chest, So stir'd the Brandy in her Breast, That an eructive Sigh she sent, Which as it through the Region went, Such wondrous Influence did bear, A soaring Owl dropt headlong there, Drunk with sophisticated Air. Which Omen much ill luck bespoke, For the next Tilt the Hero broke: The famous Wand describ'd above The Ensign of his Pow'r, and Love, But at the same time Conquest got, And doom'd the vanquish'd Bawd to Pot; To Porters Lodg he sent her jogging, To purchase Liberty by Flogging. Thus ended was the Fray that lately rose Betwixt the Whitestaff Knight and Lady o'th red Nose. Letter. Worthy Sir, Tho wean'd from all those scandalous Delights, In which I gladly once mispent my Nights, And lewdly fool'd away my Youthful Days, When Regent Punk allow'd the use of Plays; Weak Nature still prevails, and fain I'd hear What upstart Fops in Julian's Volumes are; Whether the lisping Lord, who lately writ With Words so many, and so little Wit, Has found more work for his correcting Friend, Who slily laughs at what he seems to mend. Fain would I know who limes the nauseous Bitch, Whose filthier Mouth officiates for her Breech; Whether the Booby, Whelp of Kingly Race, Or the soft Earl contented with disgrace. And yet methinks, 'tis strange that any Son Shou'd rival Rowley there, besides his own. I'd hear whether the Wight with Antick pace, Embroider'd Coat, and antiquated Face, Changing his Hebrew for a Warlike Cant, Still meets the Queenstreet lewd Inhabitant. But above all I gladly wou'd here tell Some Passages of that most decent Ball; Where Irish Squire so cunningly contriv'd, At his own charge to have his Lady Sw???. We're told how Virgins bright, and Gallants brave. Marshal'd by Bawds most infamously grave; But we don't hear of whose Commodity The lustful buggering Jew thought fit to buy Who ogled who, or how the prudent Maid Cou'd brook the Man her Sister so betray'd. Rochester's Ghost addressing it self to the Secretary of the Muses. From the deep-vaulted Den of endless Night, I've through the Center forc'd my way to Light, To sing my old Associates vain Designs, And scourge 'em into Knowledg of their Crimes; Which I my self by fatal proof may tell, If justly scan'd, as justly merit Hell. Thou Julian, who through all thy Life has shown A love to Scandal equal to my own, That mutual Friendship to thy mind recal, And what I tell thee tell again to all. A Peer shall grace the Van, and so 'tis fit, The first in Lewdness tho not first in Wit; Through all the Ills that wait on Man he'as run, As if like me he long'd to be undone. There's not a day but like some snarling Antick, It proves him either peevish, dull or frantick. Then vainly for to boast of Conquest won, What Mothers he'as betray'd, what Maids undone, Is but a snare that draws more mischief on, 'Tis strange that he who has been us'd so ill, Shou'd spite of Claps continue Cully still, Or fondly with ill Women keep a pother, First marrying one, now jilted by another. Nor shall his Buffoon Followers scape my Rage, Those fam'd Supporters of a Vicious Age, Lewd in their Lives, unlimited in Nonsense, Two Beasts that never make an use of Conscience. Pimping and Scandal are their chief delight, And yet they never get a Farthing by't. How often have I laugh'd to hear the Brutes, Engag'd in hot fantastical disputes; While all that cou'd be learn'd from the Contest, When e'er they came to earnest 'twas a jest? If they have Wit, 'tis neither more nor less Than Merry Andrew does in Fairs express, As being cloth'd in the same Clownish dress. But now 'tis time I shou'd a fourth display, Much such another Animal as they; Vain in his Garb, and vicious in his Nature, All his whole Life's but one continued Satyr Upon himself: then for his Wit, 'tis such, He thinks too little, and he prates too much; Never was such a Flux of words pour'd forth, Mixt with so little Profit, Grace or Worth. But as an Apple, tho 'twas sound before, When once a Maggot seizes on the Core, Strait the whole Mass insensibly decays, Just like our Author since he writ his Plays: Who by the rage of Pox, and Impotence, Is crampt both in his Judgment, and his Sense; And forc'd for refuge to a pitch so common, Of making Songs to please the Fools and Women. Another wou'd with these in all things sute, Only in all things he's of less repute; Baser of Soul than Form, and yet Dame Nature Ne'er before him made such an aukward Creature. True, he has Sense they say; but credit me, True Sense does not consist in Blasphemy: For 'tis the Prophets unsuspected Rule, That he that owns no God must be a Fool. Yet were this not of force to make him so, There's one undoubted proof that needs must do, And that's the Matrimonial Badg he wears; For what but such would e'er embrace the Cares Of wilful Bondage in his waining Years? Some say the Nuptial Knor was ty'd, t'unty The Mortgages which on his Land did lie; But my opinion is, they're in the wrong, He can't be just wh'as been a Knave so long: 'Tis like expecting Fish to live in Air, Or thee to leave the Juice of Grapes for Beer. O Marquis, why didst match thy Blood so ill? Hadst thou in all things shew'd such want of Skill, Thou mightest e'en have stuck at Savil still. A Sixth there is, in all that's ill so nice, He ever strove t'improve himself in Vice; It has been long his chief Delight and Care First to get Bastards, and then make them Heirs, The only Fruit which her rank Soil will bear, Or such a Fire deserve; I need not tell, She's nauseous to the Sight as to the Smell; I mean to ev'ry Smell but to his own, For he (happy in nothing else) has none. E'en Cox's Cully is before him priz'd, And where's the Man that can be more despis'd? If these are Wits, or e'er deserv'd that Name, Let me unpitied go from whence I came, Plung'd to the bottom of the rolling Flame. 'Tis true, your Laureat well deserves the Bays, Witness the Genius that adorns his Plays; But chiefly those he writ in former Days. Yet if in Death I may at least be free, As in my Lifetime he has been to me; To lay the Slave down flat upon his Face, I use his words, because the Subject's base. So that the Monarch may in Pomp appear; If not an Ass, you'l read a Villain there; For 'tis the gen'ral Vote from King to Slave, Altho the Poet's good, the Man's a Knave. But let him pass, for here comes stalking on The awful Majesty of stiff King John; With Nose cock't up, and Visage like a Fury, Or Foreman of an Ignoramus Jury. I'll speak not of his slouching Looby Mien, Altho it is the worst that e'er was seen, Because of late his whole Design and Trade is With those Accomplishments to gain the Ladies; To whom his Laurel'd Wit has op'd the way, Witness the late unparallel'd Essay, A Work which all admire, and well they may. For what insipid Sot can e'er write ill, When Waller, Lee, and Dryden guide the Quill? Faulk?d, and Ell?d, Henningh? and Wharton, M?ant, and H?w, all dull as Scotch Dunbarton, Are such a Medley of conceited Chits, I wonder who the Devil dub'd 'em Wits; Their Skill in Poetry we may best discover, Where their fowl Quills threw dirt at one another. And here would time permit me, I could tell, Of Cleveland, Portsmouth, Crofts, and Arundel, Mol. Howard, Su?x, Lady Grey, and Nell, Strangers to Good, but bosom Friends to Ill, As boundless in their Lusts as in their Will. But see! the Morning breaks, I must away; Souls damn'd to Night must never see the Day. A Consolatory Epistle to Julian in his Confinement. Dear Friend, When those we love are in distress, Kind Verse may comfort tho it can't redress; Nor can I think such Zeal you'l discommend, Since Poetry has been so much thy Friend. On that thou'st liv'd and flourish'd all thy time, Nay more, maintain'd a Family with Rhyme; And that's a mark which Dryden ne'er cou'd hit, He lives upon his Pension not his Wit. E'en gentle George (with Flux in Tongue and Purse) In shunning one snare runs into a worse. Want once may be reliev'd in a Man's Life, But who can be reliev'd that has a Wife? Otway can hardly Guts from Goal preserve, For tho he's very fat he's like to starve. And Sing-Song Durfey (plac'd beneath Abuses) Lives by his Impudence not by the Muses. Poor Crown too has his third Days mixt with Gall, He lives so ill, he hardly lives at all. Shadwel, and Settle, who pretend to Reason, Tho paid so well for scribling Doggrel Treason, Must now expect a very barren Season. But chiefly he that writ his Recantation, For Villain thrives best in his own Vocation. Nay Lee in Bedlam now sees better days, Than when applauded for his Bombast Plays. He knows no Care, he feels sharp Want no more, And that is what he ne'er cou'd say before. Thus while our Bards e'en famish by their Wit, Thou who hadst none at all, didst thrive by it. Wer't possible that Wit cou'd turn a penny, Poets would then grow rich as well as any; For 'tis not Wit to have a great Estate (The blind effects of Fortune and of Fate) For oft we see a Coxcomb, dull and vain, Brim full of Cash, and empty in his Brain. Nor is it Wit that makes the Lawyer prize His daggled Gown, but Knavery in disguise, To pluck down honest Men that he may rise. Nor is it Wit that makes the Tradesman great, 'Tis the Compendious Art to lie, and cheat. The base-born Strumpet too may roar and rail, But 'tis not Wit she lives by, 'tis her Tail. Nor is it Wit that drills the Statesman on To waste the sweets of Life so quickly gon In toiling for Estates; then like a Sot Die, and leave Fools to spend what he has got. Nor is it Wit for Whigs to scrible Satyrs, No more than for their Patriots to be Traytors; For Wit does never bring a Man to hanging, That goes no farther than an harmless banging. How justly then dost thou our Praise deserve, That got thy Bread where all Men else wou'd starve? And what's more strange, the Miracle was wrought By him that han't the least pretence to Thought; And he that had no meaning to do wrong, Can't suffer sure for their no-meaning Song. And that's the Consolation that I bring, Thou art too dull to think a treacherous thing; And 'tis the thoughtful Traytor that offends his King. A Riddle. No longer blame those on the Banks of Nile, If they ador'd the rav'nous Crocodile; Nor think the Indians mad who worship Apes, Serpents and Idols in such monstrous Shapes; Since all Mankind to me does Homage pay, More rav'nous, fatal, and deform'd than they: To me their purest Blood they sacrifice, Yet all they do ne'er can my Rage suffice. Infants each day within my Vaults expire, And Men oft perish by my Altars Fire. All rough I am, and hideous to the sight, Yet Man in me has plac'd his chief Delight; Enough of me he thinks he ne'er can seize, And yet the less I am the more I please. Calling my self deform'd, sure I mistake, Since I the chiefest part of Beauty make. But I compos'd of Contradictions am, Th'Original of Impudence and Shame, 'Tis I that kindle and then quench the Flame. I feel the greatest Pleasure, greatest Pain, When closest cover'd most expos'd to Rain; Of the most noble Plant the only Field, But bear the less the oftner I am till'd. The last of Nature's numerous Works I am, Yet first in Power, and wonderful in Frame. For tho I seem so gentle, weak, and small, The strongest yield, stoutest before me fall; Of me th'Extremes none reach, tho ne'er so tall. My only Friend, my greatest Grief and Joy, Oft stabs me, and I him as oft destroy. Between th'Herculean Pillars I am set, Where all Men have their Ne plus ultra met: My Name is hid, as I am from your Eyes; If you ne'er seek me out I'll count you wise. To Julian. Dear Julian, 'twice or thrice a Year, I wrire to help thee to some Gear; For thou by Nonsense liv'st, not Wit, As Carps thrive best where Cattel shit. But now that Province I resign, And for my Successor design Ell?d, whose Pen as nimbly glides, As his good Father changes Sides; His Head's with Thought as little vex'd, Or taking care what shou'd come next. But he a Path much safer treads, Poets live when Statesmen lose their Heads. Tho Truth in Prose might be a Crime, 'Twas never known in any time That one was hang'd for writing Rhyme. But shou'd shome Poets be accus'd That have the Government abus'd, They'd scarce be by their Neck-verse freed, Some Whigs will write that cannot read. But Charity bids us suppose, That Mor?t is not one of those; Besides, that he can write is known By's making Sucklin's Songs his own; He to the Bays in time may rise, If Etherege will but supervise To make his Verse, more soft, and tame, Which yet is without Life or Flame; Like th'Epilogue they jointly writ, To ridicule the well-horn'd Pit: A Jest that Mor?t well might spare, Unless he sat to hear it there. Jack H?, thy Patron's left the Town, But first writ something he dare own; A Prologue lawfully begotten, And full nine Months maturely thought on: Born with hard Labour and much Pain, Ouseley was Doctor Chamberlain. At length from Stuff and Rubbish pick'd, As Bears-Cubs into shape are lick'd; When Wh?ton, Etherege, and Soam, To give it the last strokes were come, Whose Criticks differ'd in their Doom. Some were for Embers quench'd with Pages, And some for mending Servants Wages: Both ways were try'd, and neither took, But the Fault's laid on Mrs. Cook; Yet Swan says he admir'd it scap'd, Since 'twas Jack H?'s without being clap'd. Our old Friend C?ts has left the Trade, His Muse is grown a very Jade; Phillis did take him at his word, And h' has his Destiny so spur'd, Of Love and Verse he's weary grown, His Pen and Passion both laid down; And to his Praise it may be said, No Love nor Songs of late h' has made. But M?ve will not leave off so, For to his Industry we owe, That we the Fate in English see Of Orpheus, and Euridice. And 'tis an Honour to the State, When a Blue Garter will translate: Who bears the Bell without dispute, From Durfy, Settle, Creech or Duke. I thought 'twould puzzle all the Nine To spoil a Poem so Divine: But he with Pains and Care doth show, It may be render'd mean, and low; So much can one great Blockhead do. Some say his Lordship had done better To answer Roger Martin's Letter, Or give Jack H? his belly full, Who justly calls him a dull Owl, For quoting Books he never read, And basely railing at the Dead. Of Ladies there's no need to tell, Since they their own Intrigues reveal, As Nor?k with her Prince Outlandish, And Isham with the Beau Lord C?dish; And Grov'ner with Lord Middleton, (Not Cholmley, who 'tis said has none.) How Walcop meets with Cartwright's Spouse, At Sadlers the Painter's House; Or how the modest Maid complain'd That Talbot had her Casement sham'd For what he had before obtain'd; How M?ant Grafton's Virtue tries, More than King John does Osseries. But yet a Line or two we'll spare, In gratitude to Lord Kildare; Whose marrying Lady Betty Jones, For's killing his first Wife atones: A Wife shee'l be for him alone, But a Help-meet to all the Town. O that kind Fate wou'd order't so, That Bellingham might do so too, And with his Folly, and Estate, Oblige the World, and marry Kate. How many then full sail would enter, That in that Port now dare not venture? But tho he's Fop enough to Woo, Present, and treat, and keep ado, When he shou'd Wed he won't come to. But these Affairs are known to all, That haunt the Park, Plays, and Whitehall; Besides, my Labour I may save, For an account you'l timely have, Who are made Cuckolds or make Love, From some oth' Authors nam'd above. A Satyr upon the Poets, being a Translation out of the 7th Satyr of Juvenal. Et spes, &amp; ratio studiorum, &amp;c. SIR, All my Endeavours, all my Hopes depend On you the Orphans, and the Muses Friend; The only great good Man, who will declare Virtue and Verse the object of his Care; And prove a Patron in the worst of Times, When hungry Bays forsakes his empty Rhymes, Beseeching all true Catholicks Charity, For a poor Prostitute which long did lie Under the Mortal Sins of Verse and Heresy. Shadwell, and starving Ta? I cease to name, Poets of all Religions are the same: Recanting Settle brings the tuneful Ware, Which wiser Smithfield damn'd to Sturbridge-Fair; Protests his Tragedies and Libels fail To yield him Paper, Penny-Loaves and Ale, And bids our Youth by his Example fly The love of Politicks and Poetry. And all Retreats except New-Hall refuse To shelter Durfey and his Jocquey Muse; There to the Butler, and his Grace's Maid, He turns, like Homer, Sonneteer for Bread; Knows his just bounds, nor ever durst aspire Beyond the swearing Groom and Kitchin Fire. Is there a Man to these Examples blind, To clinking Numbers fatally design'd, Who by his Parts would purchase Meat, and Fame, And in next Miscellanies plant his Name? Were my Beard grown, the Wretch I'd thus advise: Repent fond Mortal, and be timely wise; Take heed, nor be by gilded Hopes betray'd, Clio's a Jilt, and Pegasus a Jade; By Verse you'l starve: John Saul cou'd never live, Unless the Bellman made the Poet thrive; Go rather in some little shed by Pauls, Sell Chevy-Chase, or Baxter's Salve for Souls, Cry Raree-Shows, sell Ballads, transcribe Votes, Be Care, or Ketch, or any thing but Oates. Hold Sir, some Bully of the Muses cries, Methinks you're more Satyrical than Wise; You rail at Verse indeed, but rail in Rhyme, At once encourage and condemn the Crime. True Sir, I write, and have a Patron too, To whom my Tributary Songs are due; Yet with your leave I'd honestly disswade Those wretched Men from Pindus barren shade: Who tho they fire their Muse, and rack their Brains With blustering Heroes, and with piping Swains, Can no great patient giving Man engage To fill their Pockets, and their Title Page. Were I, like these, unhappily decreed By Penny Elegies to get my bread, Or want a Meal, unless George Croom and I Could strike a Bargain for my Poetry, I'd damn my Works to wrap up Soap and Cheese, Or furnish Squibs for City Prentices To burn the Pope, and celebrate Queen Bess. But on your Ruin stubbornly pursue, Herd with the hungry little chiming Crew, Obtain the empty Title of a Wit, And be a free-cost Noisy in the Pit: Print your dull Poems, and before 'em place A Crown of Laurel, and a Meager Face. And may just Heav'n thy hated Life prolong, Till thou blest Author seest thy deathless Song, The dusty Lumber of a Smithfield Stall, And findst thy Picture starch'd 'gainst Suburb Wall, With Johnny Armstrong and the Prodigal. And to compleat the Curse, When Age and Poverty comes faster on, And sad Experience tells thou art undone, May no kind Country Grammar-School afford Ten Pounds a Year to pay for Bead and Board; Till void of any fix'd Employ, and now Grown useless to the Army and the Plow, You've no Friend left, but trusting Landlady, Who stows you on hard Truckle Garret-high, To dream of Dinner, and curse Poetry. Sir, I've a Patron, you reply. 'Tis true, Fortune and Parts you say may get one too: Why Faith e'en try, Write, Flatter, Dedicate, My Lord's, and his Forefathers Deeds relate: Yet know he'll wisely strive ten thousand ways To shun a needy Poet's fulsom Praise; Nay to avoid thy Importunity, Neglect his State, and condescend to be A Poet, tho perhaps a worse than thee. Thus from a Patron he becomes a Friend; Forgetting to reward, learns to commend; Receives your twelve long Months successess Toil, And talks of Authors, Energy, and Stile; Damns the dull Poems of the scribling Town, Applauds your Writings, and repeats his own; Whilst thou in Complaisance oblig'd, must sit T'extol his Judgment and admire his Wit; And wrapt with his Essay on Poetry, Swear Horace writ not half so strong as he, But that we're partial to Antiquity. Yet this Authentick Peer perhaps scarce knows With jingling sounds to tag insipid Prose, And shou'd be by some honest Manly told, He'd lost his Credit to secure his Gold. But if thou'rt blest enough to write a Play, Without the hungry hopes of kind third Day, And he believes that in thy Dedication Thou'lt fix his Name, not bargain for the Station: My Lord his useless Kindness then ?abiures?, And to the utmost of his pow'r he's yours. How fine your Plot, how exquisite each Scene! And play'd at Court wou'd strangely please the Queen. And you may take his Judgment sure, for he Knows the true Spirit of good Poetry; And might with equal judgment have put in For Poet Laureat as Lord Ch?in. All this you see and know, yet cease to shun; And seeing knowing, strive to be undone. So Kidnapt Dutchess once beyond Gravesend, Rejects the Counsel of recalling Friend; Is told the dreadful Bondage she must bear, And sees, unable to avoid the snare. So practis'd Thief oft taken, ne'er afraid, Forgets the Sentence, and pursues the Trade. Tho yet he almost feels the smoking Brand, And sad T. R. stands fresh upon his Hand. The Author then, whose daring hopes would strive With well built Verse to keep his Fame alive, And something to Posterity present, That's very new and very excellent; Something beyond the uncal'd drudging Tribe, Beyond what Bays can write or I describe; Shou'd in substantial happiness abound, His Mind with Peace, his Board with Plenty crown'd. No early Duns should break his Learned Rest, No sawcy Cares his nobler Thoughts molest, Only the God within should shake his labouring Breast. In vain we from our Sonneteers require The height of Cowleys, and Anacreon's Lyre. In vain we bid 'em fill the Bowl, Large as their capacious Soul, Who since the King was crown'd ne'er tasted Wine, But write at sight, and know not where to dine. In vain we bid dejected Settle hit The Tragick Flights of Shakespear's towring Wit; He needs must miss the Mark, who's kept so low, He has not strength enough to draw the Bow. Sedley indeed and Rochester might write For their own credit, and their Friends delight, Shewing how far they cou'd the rest outdo, As in their Fortunes, so their Writings too. But shou'd Drudg Dryden this example take, And Absaloms for empty Glory make, He'd soon perceive his Income scarce enough To feed his Nostril with inspiring Snuff; Starving for Meat, not surfeiting on Praise, He'd find his Brains as barren as his Bays. There was a time when Otway charm'd the Stage, Otway the Hopes, the Sorrow of our Age; When the full Pit with pleas'd attention hung, Wrapt with each accent from Castalio's Tongue. With what a Laughter was his Soldier read! How mourn'd they when his Jaffier struck, and bled! Yet this best Poet, tho with so much ease, He never drew his Pen but sure to please; Tho Lightning were less lively than his Wit, And Thunder-claps less loud than those o'th' Pit He had of's many Wants much earlier dy'd, Had not kind Banker Betterton supply'd, And took for Pawn the Embryo of a Play, Till he could pay himself the next third Day. Were Shakespear's self to live again, he'd ne'er Degen'rate to a Poet from a Player. Carlile ith' new rais'd Troops we see, And chattering Mountfort in the Chancery; Mountfort how fit for Politicks and Law, That play'd so well Sir Courtly and Jack Daw. Dance then attendance in slow M?ves Hall, Read Maps, or court the Sconces till he call; One Actor's Commendation shall do more Than Patron now, or Merit heretofore. Some Poets I confess the Stage has fed, Who for half Crowns are shown, for two Pence read; But these not envy thou, but imitate, Much rather starve in Shadwel's silent Fate, Than new vamp Farces, and be damn'd with Tate. For now no Sydneys will three hundred give, That needy Spencer and his Fame may live; None of our new Nobility will send To the King's Bench, or to his Bedlam Friend. Chymists and Whores by Buckingham were fed, Those by their honest Labours gain'd their Bread; But he was never so expensive yet, To keep a Creature merely for his Wit; And Cowley from all Clifden scarce could have One grateful Stone to shew the World his Grave. Pemb? lov'd Tragedy, and did provide For Butchers Dogs, and for the whole Bankside; The Bear was fed, but dedicating Lee Was thought to have a larger Paunch than he. More I cou'd say, but care not much to meet A Crabtree Cudgel in a narrow Street. Besides, your Yawning prompts me to give o'er: Your humble Servant, Sir, not one word more. Letter to C?W. Here take this W?, spread it up and down, Thou second scandal Carrier of the Town; Thy Trapstick Legs, and foolish puny Face, Look as if Nature meant thee for an Ass. In this vocation thou'lt grow greater far Than e'er thou'lt do by Stratagems of War. Waste not thy Time, nor hurt thy tender Lungs In going up and down to sing new Songs. But yet in time of Julian's Fate beware; More secret be, or you may lose an Ear. I'll tell thee now where Libels may be had, Who are the Benefactors of the Trade. Cholm? has Satyr for his Province chose, The only way he dares attack his Foes, Not in smooth Verse but rough ill-natur'd Prose. Laughing at all, which yet may Justice seem, For long we know the Town has laugh'd at him. He oft has aim'd at Love, but ne'er cou'd hit; And now wou'd put ill Nature off for Wit. For all his Dressing, and his Foppish Train, He and his Sister ogle it in vain, The Ladies he, and she the cruel Men. And that we may to all due Justice render, Exeter's Songs most move the Maidens tender; Yet Lady Bridget does so cruel prove, Six Songs a day can't her Compassion move. Never for Women was so bad a time, Baseness in Men is grown a common Crime, Which Frazier does lament in tender Rhyme. Parsons set up for a Pindarick Spark, Pindar himself did never write more dark; So rough his Numbers, and such Mystick sense, Sarsfield himself scarce knows who 'tis he means. Baber has left the Panegyrick strain, And now to Ballad-making turns his Brain, At which Will Wh?on long has strove in vain; From that dull Fop what could expected be, The dullest of that senseless Family? Sackville wants leisure to attend his Muse, His time's so taken up with these Reviews, And Skipwith with his Grannam of a Spouse. Old Griff. once did write, but now has done, And wisely sets himself to teach his Son Those Rules by which he grows a Fop compleat, And when he is as Old will be as Great. His Neighbour Fenw? with his antick Face, These 40 Years has studied French Grimace; In ogling C?wright his Delight does place. Yet so unhappy does his Passion prove, She takes it all for Dotage not for Love: VVhile poor Frank Villers, full of awful Fears, And tender Love, has follow'd many Years; Yet no reward his constant Passion claims, But that he may enjoy her in his Dreams. His Sister does him Service with his Friend, But Mrs. Nancy to her cost does find, Her feeble Charms are by her Friends out-shin'd: Yet strives by Art her Comrade to outdo, Counterfeit Beauty must give way to true; And yet the meanest Beauty claims a part, E'en Swan can move with her old rotten Heart. Yarbor? her Wisdom in young L?er shows, One fit to make a patient Cuckold chose. S?th's Conquests are too great to be reveal'd, And like her Pleasures ought to be conceal'd; The rest too mean to have in Verse a place, Here, as at Court, shall unregarded pass. Next Ishams Wife, now Devonsh? is gone, Can boast of senseless Willoug? alone; By Nature made for one another fit, For Beauty is as nauseous as his Wit. But to Kild? all Beauty sure must yield, The Park and Plays are with her Lovers fill'd. The mighty Roch? who rules our State, By Presents shows his Love at no small rate. Her pimping Father got young Fox's place, Not by his Merit, but his Daughter's Face. Devonsh? Passion all his Actions show; Because he loves her, Monstross does so too; Scarf? and D'Arcy both her Captives prove, So hard it is to know her and not love. Disbanded Manch? when will he go, And in the Spanish Court his dancing show? He looks already with his formal Air, More like a Spanish Don than English Peer; And that he may a well-bred Spark become, Let him take Denmark in his Journy home. There's one Peer more we well may wish away, His own dear Cousin flattering Capt. Gray. The Powis Daughters now fill up the Court, Did ever Wales such monstrous things bring forth? It shows some sense when nauseous Creatures hide: But that to show themselves should be their Pride, Tells us their Wit is worse than their Outside. Twice jilted Co?ry, now thy Fortune try, The Widow Arran ne'er did Man deny; Sh?ry and twenty more have found her easy, This is a Quality will surely please ye. King John, who Cheating has his business made, Has bought the Widow o'er Nor?ton's Head; This Match was ne'er in Heaven made, but Hell; All wish 'em join'd, for none wish either well. Methinks I see the Brandy Bowl go round, The drunken Countess wallowing on the Ground, With Horns instead of Bays the Hero crown'd. The Female Laureat. If Afra's Worth were needful to be shown, What Pen could do it better than her own? Thro all her Works a happy Warmth does shine, That renders e'ery thing she writes Divine. Witness her Golden Age, so fam'd a Piece, It has at once outdone both Rome and Greece. “The Nymphs, she says, were free, no nice Disdain “Forbad their Joys, or gave their Lovers Pain; “Ten thousand wanton Cupids you might view, “That scatter'd lech'rous Darts where'er they flew; “Here you might see expecting Virgins lie, “And strait young Swains those Virgins Lusts supply. This Age she paints, and with such great Success, That all things but her Chastity are less. Next awful Bajazet's more awful Flame, Her Wit has plac'd in the first Rank of Fame; And sure his Passion's fit for her to sing, Who is a Slave, and would be thought a King. Go on then, mighty Poetress, go on, And finish what's so happily begun; In lofty Language and adventurous Verse, Your Patron Bajazet's great Worth rehearse; Bajazet, from Pride and Envy free, Bajazet, Prince of Humility, Bajazet, the fittest Theme for thee. Describe his matchless Loyalty to's Prince, His great Civility, and greater Sense; How courteously he to all Men does bend, And what delight he takes to serve his Friend: But above all, that dauntless Courage show With which he flew to quell the Tangier Foe, And how the Gen'ral after two days stay, When all the rest were fighting, came away; But first perform'd all his Commission bid, Nothing he went to do, and nothing did. When this thou'st done, who knows but he may prove, Since Gloriana's Heart's too firm to move, So good at last, to crown you with his Love? And sure Jove never join'd a happier Pair, He kind as lovely, you as good as fair. Twin'd in his Arms, I wish you happy Days, While I'm content t'adore thee in thy Plays. What tho your Heroes are sworn Foes to Sense, And affect Bombast, Noise, and Insolence? VVhat tho your loyal Men are lewd and vain, Ridiculous, impertinent, profane? VVhat tho your vertuous VVomen Vertue hate, And your chast Virgins curse their Virgin State? What tho thou bring'st (to please a vicious Age) Af ar more vicious Widow on the Stage, Just reaking from a Stallion's rank Embrace With rifled Garments, and disorder'd Face, T'acquaint the Audience with her slimy case? What can the surly Criticks urge from hence, When thou shalt rise up in thine own defence, And plead Impenitable Impudence? Such Impudence! but gentle Muse retire, And what thou canst not comprehend, admire. Advice to the Painter, Upon the defeat of the Rebels in the West, and the Execution of the late D. of Monmouth. — Pictoribus atque Poetis Quidlibet — Since by just Flames the The Duke's Picture burnt at Cambridg. guilty Piece is lost, The noblest Work thy fruitless Art could boast; Renew thy faithful Pains a second time, From the Duke's Ashes raise the Prince of Lime, And make thy Fame eternal as his Crime. The Holland. Land (if such it may be counted) draw, Whose Interest is Religion, Treason Law; Th'ingrateful Land, whose treach'rous Sons are Foes To the kind Monarchy by which they rose, And by instinctive Hatred dread that Pow'r, Join'd in our King and in their Conqueror. Amidst the Councils of this black Divan, Draw the misled, aspiring, wretched Man, His Sword maintaining what his Fraud began. Draw Treason, Sacrilege, and Perfidy, The curst Achitophel's kind Legacy; Three direful Engines of a Rebel's hate, Fit to perform the blackest work of Fate. But lest their horrid Force too weak shou'd prove, Add Lady Harr. Wentworth. tempting Woman's more destructive Love: Give the ambitious Fair— All Nature's Gifts refin'd by subtlest Art, Too able to betray that easy Heart, And with more Charms than Helen's to destroy That other Hope of our mistaken Troy. The Scene from Dulness, and Dutch Plots bring o'er, And set the hopeful Parracide ashore, Fraught with the Blessings of each boorish Friend, And the kind helps their Pray'rs and Brandy lend, With those few Crowns— Some English Jews, and some French Christians send. Next in thy darkest Colours paint the Taunton. Town, For old hereditary Treason known, Whose Infant Sons in early Mischiefs bred, Swear to the Cov'nant they can hardly read; Brought up with too much Charity to hate Ought but their Bible, and their Magistrate. Here let the gaudy Banner be display'd, While the kind Fools invoke their Neighbours Aid T'adore that Idol they themselves have made, And Peasants from neglected Fields resort To fill his Army, and adorn his Court. Near this, erected on a Drum unbrac'd, Let Heaven's and James's Ferguson. Enemy be plac'd, The Wretch that hates, like false Argyle, the Crown, The Wretch that, like vile Oates, defames the Gown, And through the Speaking-trumpet of his Nose Heav'n's Sacred Word profanely does expose, Bidding the large-ear'd Rout with one accord Stand up and fight the Battel of the Lord. Then nigh the pageant Prince (alas too nigh!) Paint G. with a Romantick Constancy, Resolv'd to conquer, or resolv'd to fly; And let there in his guilty Face appear The Rebel's Malice and the Coward's Fear, That future Ages in thy Face may see Not his VVife falser to his Bed, than to all Parties he. Now let the curst Triumvirate prepare For all the baneful Ills of horrid VVar; Let zealous Rage the dreadful VVork begin, Back'd with the sad Variety of Sin; Let Vice in all its numerous Shapes be shown, Crimes which to milder Brennus were unknown, And innocent Cromwel would have blush'd to own. Their Arms from pillag'd Temples let 'em bring, And rob the Deity to wound the King. Excited then by their Camp-Priest's long Pray'r, Their Country's Curses, and their own Despair, VVhile Hell combines with its vile Offspring Night, To hide their Treachery, or secure their Flight, The watchful Troops with cruel haste come on, Then shout, look terrible, discharge, and run. Fal'n from his short-liv'd Pow'r and flatter'd Hopes, His Friends destroy'd by Hunger, Swords, and Ropes; To some near Grove the VVestern Monarch flies, In vain the innocent Grove her Shade denies. The Juster Trees— VVho when for refuge Charles and Virtue fled, By grateful Instinct their glad Branches spread, And round the Sacred Charge cast their inlarged Head, Straight when the outcast Absalom comes nigh, Drop off their fading Leaves, and blasted die. Nor Earth her self Taken in a Ditch. will hide her guilty Son, Tho he for refuge to her Bowels run. Rebellious Corah to her Arms she took, VVhen Heav'n, and Israel his old Cause forsook; But now provok'd by a more just disdain, She shrinks her frighted Head, and gives our Rebel back again. Now Artist, let thy juster Pencil draw The sad effects of necessary Law. In painted VVords, and speaking Colours tell The dismal Exit this sham Prince befel; On the sad Scene the glorious Rebel place, VVith Pride and Sorrow strugling in his Face; Describe the Pangs of his distracted Breast (If by thy Labours Thought can be exprest) Shew with what difference two vast Passions move, And how the Hero with the Christian strove. Then place the Sacred Prelate by his side, To raise his Sorrow, and confound his Pride, With the dear dreadful thoughts of a God crucify'd. Paint, if thou canst, the heav'nly VVords that hung Upon the Holy Mens perswasive Tongue, VVords sweet as Moses writ, or Asaph sung; VVords whose prevailing Influence might have won All but the haughty harden'd Absalon. At distance round their weeping Mother, place The too unmindful Fathers beauteous Race; But like the Grecian Artist spread a Veil O'er the sad Beauties of fair Annabel. No Art, no Muse those Sorrows can express, VVhich would be render'd by Description less. Here close the dismal Scene, conceal the rest That the sad Orphans Eyes will teach us best; Thy guilty Art might raise our ill-tim'd Grief too high, And make us, while we pity him, forget our Loyalty. Madam Le Croy. Of all the Plagues Mankind possess, Defend me from the Sorceress, Who draws from Lines her Calculations, Instead of Squares for Demonstrations; Such as Le Croy imposes on The credulous deluded Town; Who tho they know themselves but fool'd, Bring double Fees for being gull'd. So Client jilted of his Suit, Loses his Cause, and pays to boot. In comes a Duke from mighty Place And Merit, faln into disgrace; She views his Hand, and bids him Joy, Calls him his Excellence Vice-Roy. With this high Character the Bubble Is well content, and pays her double: Nor dreams he's banish'd with his Fleet A Slave to Pathmos or to Creet. As Richm? to the Northern Frost, And Clarend? to the Irish Coast, Blinded with Pride, senseless of Ruin, So Fools embrace their own undoing. Graft? with Jealousy opprest, She adds a Crescent to his Crest; No Planet-mount his Brow adorns, Saturn and Venus turn to Horns: His Grace is but an Independant, Whilst Mord? rules in the Ascendant Northum? does next implore The Stars which Lucy curst before: And 'twas his Fate, altho he made A Cloister of the Nuptial Bed, Whence she's return'd with double Charms, A Vestal to his faithless Arms. St. Alb? Duke, who never sought her, By th'bargain gets N?castles Daughter: So says Le Croy, but juster Fate Dooms him a Match at Billinsgate; Nor will N?castle his hopes place In a base Bastard Pippin Race. For So?set, she takes upon her To sooth him up with Maids of Honour: Courage, tho Youth and Beauty fail, Your Grace has Charms that will prevail; No Virgin but must yield a Martyr T'an Idol of the Star, and Garter. These, M?ve, were the pow'rful Charms Brought Conway Captive to thy Arms; 'Twas not thy Figure, Wit, nor Wealth, It was the Star that made the Stealth: Shortly she will repent the Action, Thy Hopper-arse will cause the Faction. Northamp?, happier in his choice, In Virgin-Wedlock plac'd his Joys; Wisely he shun'd that dire Intrigue, Doom'd to be thy eternal Plague: Of all for better or for worse, In missing her he scap'd the Curse. Gray's little Hand she next do's prove, Brimfull of Luck and Heart of Love. The Fates you need no more importune, This is the very line of Fortune; My Lord, you are most sure of Nancy, If there be truth in Necromancy. With Elland how shall we demean us? Bless me! what's here, the Mount of Venus! The Table thwarted too! this shows, You'll die a Martyr in the Cause; If you wou'd shun this dismal Fate, Go home my Lord, and Salivate. Beware of Mercury and such Foes, Compound with Venus for your Nose. With Love and Indignation warm, Ch?ly begins to huff and storm; I dress and keep an Equipage With any Coxcomb of the Age. Pray tell me then a reason why Each Tinker has his Trull but I? Your Hand, you need not be so stout, My Lord your Line of Love is out. Learn then, if you would have Success, More Wit and less Affectedness. With shoulder Belt and gaudy Feather, Ten Yards of Crevat ty'd together, Comes New?gh; by these Lines exprest, As you'd a narrow Scape i'th' West, This Demicircle here declares You'l meet worse Wounds in Venus Wars. But have a care how you ingage For a new Coach and Equipage; Lavish and Love's a double Dart, That breaks your Back, and this your Heart. So Hounds and Huntsmen Hare o'erpower, And what those worry, these devour. But these are not the only Fools, Le Croy has choice of female Gulls, Who puff'd with Pride do flock in vain, Blown up e'er they discern the Train. Thus Lucy into Bondage run For a great Name to be undone; Deluded with the Name of Dutchess, She fell into the Lion's Clutches: This was Le Croy's bewitching Cheat, Her Sacred Thirst of being great. Whilst Graf? in her Duke less blest, Is of her Buccanier possest; With Shr?ry whose Love's intent, And all the Rout that nose the Scent. With wither'd Hand and wrinkled Brow Cleveland in Rage comes next, to know What desperate Tatterdemallion Should next vouchsafe to be her Stallion. But by the Wrinkles on her Brow, She's told her Charms quite fail her now; And since she coupled with a Strowler, Her next Admirer must be Jowler. Arran with counterfeited Grace, And muffled Veil about her Face, Shews to Le Croy her snowy Fist, Who cries, six Husbands at the least; But yet there's none to that lewd Damp, No second Love dares light a Lamp. Kildare a Beauty in her Bloom, In vizor steals to know her Doom. Ye Gods! A double Line of Life, Madam you'l make a thund'ring Wife; Great Jove himself and all the Land Besides your Lord, at your command: Devon?, Mul?, Scars?, all Shall Captives to your Empire fall; Till for a virtuous Wife renown'd, Your Wittall Lord at last is crown'd. Next comes young Fox's barren Bliss, She reads her Fortune in her Phys! Besides, I find it in your Hand, Madam, you must be better man'd; Your brawny Spouse's gross Infusion Sutes not your airy Constitution: If for an Heir you would not want, Make meagre Darcy your Gallant. Fine Lady Cartwright in her Chair To know her Doom does next repair, Pursu'd by Fenwick, Frank, and Gray, Who sigh all night, and dodg all day: As Beggars dream of golden Heaps, Each longs, but none the Treasure reaps. The next fine Widow Whitmore, she Is told of gentle Cornb???; But the sly Wight secur'd the Prey, And flying bore the Nymph away. Miss Nancy shall bring up the Reer, Whose Fortune is to have a Peer; If 'ten't her harder Fate to be Confounded with Variety. So tir'd with Change, some Courtly Nice She makes the last, and the worst choice. Why should I tire your Patience out With Warwick and the wrinkled Rout, Hinton or Howard? I could tell ye Of thousands besides Hughes and Nelly, Who daily crowd upon the Plains, To find out choice of youthful Swains. But all those Charms that did kind Warmth infuse, Worn out of date have chil'd my tired Muse. The Lover's Session. In Imitation of Sir John Suckling's Session of Poets. A session of Lovers was held t'other day, And Venus her self was present they say. The best in Christendom long kept in reserve, Was now to be his who least did deserve. Therefore the Fools of all Parties came thither, 'Twas strange to see how the Owls flock'd together; There were Fops by Breeding, and Tonies by Birth, Damn'd Oafs of all sorts this fat Island brings forth. Gentle Fools of the Flute, and Fools of the Pen, Virtuosi thrice married turn'd Bullies agen, Dancing Fools a vast Crowd, and Fools learn'd in Arts, Fops furnish'd in France with good Natural Parts. Familiar dear Hearts who kiss all they salute, And out of meer Dulness with no Man dispute; Who think themselves welcome wherever they come, And call all they know Jack, Will, Harry, Tom. Sour Fanaticks, Christ's wealthy ill-favour'd Breed, With strong carnal Itches and spiritual Pride; Popish Priests in the Garb of lewd Lay-Brother, Still whoring in Couples to absolve one another. Turn-servers, who hopeful Imployments devour, Drunken Brutes in the Badges of Absolute Power, Cits aping Court Fops in Debauchery and Dress, And proud ignorant Statesmen hard of Access. Dull Blockheads in Cassocks, Law-Knaves dy'd in Grain, Physicians in Querpo, and Clowns in Champaign; Like Bees they came swarming at Venus's Call, There was Fop of Fop-Corner, and Fop of Fop-Hall. Song Sackvill with all the new Beaux at his back, Lewd rakelly Spencer and finical Pack, Warcup near Newburgh, for they kept no Order, Montrath and Frank Villers a little further. Harry Wharton fresh reaking from Norfolk's lewd Moll, Shamplot-maker Lumly, and Colchester Voll, Northumberland wrapt in his Mother's lov'd Smock, And D' Arcy kept lean by old Guy's young Hock. Harsh favor'd Scarburgh with Scarsdale the stinking, And Bridges created a Wit for hard drinking. Soft Whitaker next, Fop Gerards both the Brothers, Fop Hewit, Fop Baber, and divers others. Devonsh???, who all his mistaken Life long Has delighted in Show, publick Meeting and Throng, And at fifty against all Reason and Rule Seems resolv'd to persist in playing the Fool. E'er this strange High Commission Court was well set, Came and knock'd with a Lover's concern at the Gate, And cozening the Doorkeeper with his Fop Mien, Without any Ticket had like t'have got in. But Venus, who knew him much better than they, With a Frown like dead Lady Betty, they say, Forbad his Admittance, and told him in short, 'Twas an old fundamental Rule of the Court. Tho some the best stor'd never any did use, But liv'd as if Frampton their Business did choose; Tho others drest high, and half star'd out their Eyes, Not one who had Sense must pretend to the Prize. And tho his French Breeding floated at top, And has tawder'd his Outside over with Fop; It plainly appear'd to all the World's wonder, The Man of true Wit, and Worth that lay under. When Mord? heard this, he leapt up from the Throng, And in whimsical Raving full three Hours long, With gross want of Judgment, for Bedlam more fit, He daily mistakes for abounding in Wit. He excus'd his intruding and breaking of Rules, Protesting he did not know they were Fools; But took ev'ry Member there by his Mien, For as hopeful a Wit as his Pupil Gwyn. This said, he would fain have slipt out of the Crowd. But Venus recall'd him, and told him aloud, None there to the Place had a better pretence; For just talking, not much, was the Mark of good Sense. That his rambling Vien, for holding out well, The ablest Fanatick's Light did excel; Tho no Man could for Wit or Reason approve, Might pass with young Women for Passion and Love. But she bid him beware when his Throws did begin, By his Noise not to call all the Neighbourhood in, For his Friends Expectation too oft had been bit. By the loud, but false crying out of his Wit. For a deal of Love the fair Sex did owe him, As well as the Good of all who should know him: She pray'd that the Muses Lucina would deign To deliver him of his no Jests with less Pain. While Mort?'s Perfections she thus did display, She perceiv'd little Falkland sneaking away, And vow'd she admir'd how that frivolous Chit Ever came to pass on the Town for a Wit. His Grandfather, honour'd by all, is confest Was with Wisdom and Riches like Solomon blest, But he left him nothing, and 'twas his hard Fate To inherit no more of his Parts than Estate. A Mimick he is, tho a bad one at best, Still plagu'd with an impotent Itch to a Jest; In appurtenant Action he spares no Expence, He has all the Ingredients of Wit but the Sense. His Face oft of Laugh and Humour is full, When his Talk is impertinent, empty and dull: But if so low buffooning can merit our Praise, Frank Newport, and Jevon, and Haines must have Bays. Or if French Memoirs read from Broadstreet to Bow, Can make a Man wise, then Falkland is so. And for full confirmation of all she did say, She produc'd his damn'd Prologue to Otway's last Play. Some reply'd, What her Majesty said was most true, Yet to give the ignorant Devil his due, Tho he made good Judges but indifferent sport, He was the best Fop of a Statesman at Court. But Dorington now started up in great Wrath, What not Falkland a Wit! No Sir by my troth; Of which for the present clearer proof needs none, Than his taking the coxcombly Worship for one. The Sect of Songsters here stir'd up Sedition, And in shoals prefer'd a tumultuous Petition; Beseeching the Court not to think them too wise, To raffle their Time and Estates for the Prize. Alledging, They us'd the Muses but as Bawds to Intrigues, Caring for them no more than Cromwell or Migs; And that but for their frantick amorous Fits, They had ne'er took upon them the Business of Wits. Humbly hoping that Sense would not pass for a Crime, That was flatten'd to Panegyrical Rhyme; And offering good proof from Maids, Widows and Wives, Of the inoffensive Dulness of their Lives. Protesting at last, if the Sex were in fears, They could e'en use their Fancies as bad as their Ears; That rather than the Hopes of their Favours they'd quit, They'd lay by their impudent Title to Wit. But Venus, who all their Adventures had learn'd, With a gracious Smile bid them not be concern'd; For that little they had was so void of all Charm, As it did them no good, so 'twould do them no harm. Young Griffin, apparent Son of the Old, In the same belle Air his booby Father roll'd, Just Image of the Pride with which he swells, And in whom the Fulness of his Folly dwells; Not doubting Success, first of any did rise, And in arrogant Terms demanded the Prize. But when told by the Court, which his Carriage did blame, He a reason must give for his confident Claim; He pertly reply'd, Truth, Reason, and Wit, Were three things ne'er ask'd of his Family yet; And tho he lov'd Whoring because 'twas a Vice, He ne'er should be able to pay such a Price. Newburgh was the next who stood up to his Tryal, Ne'er dreaming that Face could e'er meet with Denial; That Face which so often i'th Circle was prais'd, And Dissension among the Q?s Virgins had rais'd. But the Jewess, who still of his Purse stood in need, Had privately advis'd the Bench to take heed, Not to judg by the Outside, howe'er likely and fair, For tho stiff in the Back he was limber elsewhere. Harry Henningham thought himself sure of a Grant; But O foolish, cries out Villain Frank, he's a Cant, His Mistress ne'er knows, so odd 'tis exprest, Whether he means to make Love or a Jest. For he puts on so many several Faces, Is so full of his frank, familiar Grimaces, They cannot but think he's acting a Part, And his passionate Speech has gotten by Heart. Besides, Lady Bellamount had let the Court know, That his Person was good for just nothing but Show; That his slim Barbary Back was too long, His Stomach too weak, and Hectic too strong. When Kildare's Name was call'd, all thought he would speed, And sure he was Fool enough to succeed. But new R?r strait (O how unlike the first!) In terms of a Treasurer's Insolence burst. And as Venus was going his Suit to allow, On the Faith of a cast Politician's Vow, That of all Men living he needed it least, For his Wife's he knew well was as good as the best; Huntington, that his weaking Whey Visage might pass, Pul'd out the best thing that belongs to an Ass; But in Love's Court, tho ours might use such a Tool, They abhor'd an inconstant Weathercock Fool. Villain Frank, well advis'd by a small Pocket-Glass Of his damn'd disagreeable Vermin-like Face; And knowing what juster Pretensions would be, Brought the Bench a Mandamus subscribed S. P. The Court on this dangerous Practice reflecting, Cry'd out, We'll maintain our old Right of Electing; C?s still have been free, nor can any confine 'em, Or bring to the Bench their Jus Divinum. But resolving however to shew some respect To the State whose Commands they'd good cause to reject, Like Maudlins they approv'd, to th'Assistants great Joy, Sir Courtly unfit for the courted Employ. To his shame and confusion his Friends swore point blank, No Nun was so spotless a Virgin as Frank; All thought it unjust, the fair Sex's Pride Should run any risk with a F?r untry'd. The Court, tho against the strict Rules of their Laws, Declar'd, on that Issue they'd put the whole Cause: Had he e'er rem in re, he should now have the best, But his guilty Silence the Scandal confest. Here his Exchequer Clerks, e'er they let him retire, Told the Court 'twas not Virtue but want of Desire; And tho he was unable, they had very good Proof, Sister Nancy would for the whole Name do enough. Montrath was in Foppery conceiv'd another Of Whitehall true Breed, Sir Nices Twin Brother; None could tell, so alike all their Follies did seem, Whether he acted Mumford, or Mumford him. But all cry'd at the sound of that Irish Name, His Birth was for ever a bar to his Claim; No League to make Love could his blockishness shape, They had only the Gift of Murder, and Rape. Harry Lumly some thought for an elderly Beau, By the help of his Dress made a pretty good show; His Back too was prais'd since he first found the trick, To make ramish Williams content with one P??. But he had a blemish by's blighted Look shown, Which in Beauties Adonis was never yet known: The Pox that was given him by his own Wife, Was likely to last him as long as his Life. When M?ague appear'd, the Court gave him a touch For affecting the Wit, and the Bully so much; For the one neither Nature had form'd him nor Art, And the other was ne'er thought a Gentleman's Part. He had Faults too that lost him so much with the Fair, As neither his Face nor his Youth could repair; They found the raw Temper with half Sense accurst, Too presuming at last, too bashful at first. Their Eyes were more kindly on Constable cast, For judging so ill, and prating so fast; He slightly skims o'er all that comes in his way, With as hasty, and shallow a Fathom as they. But tho his light Humour most Women did hit, His Parts have a nearer resemblance of Wit; The Court too declar'd they would first be assur'd, Whether yet the thrust in his Groin were well cur'd. Little Rowley was miss'd, for the Whigs who did know His Wit no where else but in Dutchland would go, Had there sent him Leger with full Deputation, To make Jests on the Court for the good of the Nation. But one of his Friends swore he'd leave the Queen's cause, And turn Rebel to Love's irresistible Laws; If in all her wide Empire she ever did see A Coxcomb so fit for a Cully as he. But Politicks employ'd all his time, and 'twas said, Our pert offer'd Scholar would ne'er be well bred, Nor brought (so vain is th'unformable Elf) To advice, or mind any thing else but himself. Here the Bench in one Language their Anger exprest, And told his Whig Friends, they should bid him at least Get so much good Sense in his magotty Pate, As to use his Wife well till he got her Estate. Fe?am in his Sedgemore Star, and Glory, Proud as the Treasurer, and pettish as Lory, Forgetting how oft he had wrong took his Aim, With a French Assurance next put in his Claim. But Fifty had brought a defect of that sort, As ne'er found forgiveness in Venus's Court; He was never in health, as himself would oft own, But when he did let that Business alone. M?nt would be thought to have already the best, But let his Wife's Covetous—be at rest; In vain his Invention is still on the Tenters, Don Quixot ne'er went on more luckless Adventures. The damn'd tedious Lies he tells in's own Praise, That supreme Adoration he to himself pays, That contempt of his Friends, and that unsettl'd Head, An aversion in the most forward has bred. His babling Tongue at St. James's large Square, Could punctually tell both the when, and the where, In the middle of all his vain towring Hopes, He was beaten with his own Ladder of Ropes. Sir James Hayes here his fluent Flattery display'd To the Fair, and a Thousand fine Promises made, If Faulkland might pass a Night with her in bed, But Dapperwit had a trick worth two on't he said. The Sodomite Itch his Fancy did sway, He would fain have us'd his Wife the wrong way; But the Slattern was resty, and vow'd she would ne'er Give any Man joy who grudg'd her a share. Nor?land now to his Trial stood forth, And pleaded the Preference due to his Birth; No Fool he did hope, howe'er eminent, wou'd Presume to compare with a Fool of the Blood. Appealing besides to his scandalous Marriage, His beautiful Face, and his dull stupid Carriage, To a Soul without sense of Truth, Honour, or Wit, If e'er Man was form'd for Woman so fit. But his Prince-like Project to kidnap his Wife, And a Lady so free to make Prisoner for Life, Was Tyranny to which the Sex ne'r would submit, And an ill natur'd Fool they lik'd worse than a Wit. Gr?ton, back'd by his Officers, made an effort To have the new Venus seen naked in Court; Urging, whate'er Fame in her favour had spoke, 'Twas unfit Men should buy a Pig in a Poke. But had she appear'd, D?comb swore by his Life He had us'd her as once he did Elland's vain Wife; No sooner was his rude Request disallow'd, But on the whole Bench he lookt big, and talkt loud. What his bluff Speech did mean they were all in suspence, Some say 'twas Tarpaulin Language, and Sense: But this was e'ery tittle the Court understood, It began with G???me, and clos'd with G??? Blood. An old ugly Lawyer at last did appear, And brought in black Boxes a Thousand a Year: At which all th'Assembly murmur'd, contending He had long since past the Age of pretending. But Venus reproving them, bid him come nigher, And when he was mounted up a little higher, She openly declar'd that Wealth and Estate Was to catch Womankind the infallible Bait. This pow'rful Temptation none e'er cou'd oppose; It covers all Faults, and all Virtue bestows; 'Tis a lure which the highest flown Jilts can command, Make 'em stoop, and bring the wild Haggards to hand. Fifteen it can draw to the Arms of Threescore; Procure Apsly a Wife, and Clifford a Whore, It still carries with it, such Philtres are in it, The Canonical hour, and the Critical minute. 'Twas this Spell the fair Montagues eyes so put out, She could neither see S?olks Age nor his Gout; And in spite of his Humour, yet worse than his Face, Brought long averse Newport to Herberts Embrace. This, this is the Charm which never did fail O'er Beauty, Youth, Merit, and Wit to prevail; And without a Syllable more or less said, To young Luck she put the old Fumbler to Bed. Much muttering there was, and some spar'd not the Queen, In every Man's Face displeasure was seen; Each thought himself by the strange Sentence ill us'd, And the partial blindness of Fortune accus'd. But all cheer'd up at last, not a Sot that was there But hop'd in his turn with the Lawyer to share, And that since for twenty good Summers at least He had left being a Man, she would make him a Beast. Doctor Wild's Ghost, on his Majesty's Declaration for Liberty of Conscience. How! Liberty of Conscience! That's a change Balks the Crape Gown, and mortifies L' Estrange. Two lines of brisk Gazette in pieces tears, All Crackfarts labour'd Scribles 20 Years. The Clergy-Guide himself is left ith' lurch, To which he quailpip'd easy Daughter Church. So the foul Fiend at Hammeton, they say, In Fidlers Guise so charmingly did play, That all the Buxom Youths of that mad Town Follow'd his charming wheedling up and down, Till the whole Troop an unseen Gulph did drown. What's now become of our Informing Crew, The Browns, the Hiltons? O the Loyals true! Once Pillars of the Church, the Church by Law, For more were bug-bear'd to her Church by Aw, Than all the Sermon-Readers e'er could draw. Those useful Blades, Instruments Orthodox, Soon as they found the Church was ith' wrong box, Fell from her faster than from Whore with Pox. So Rats by Instinct quit a falling House; So dying Beggar's left by every Louse. P??? the Spiritual Dragoon, who made By Soul-money a pretty thriving Trade, Gave to Old Nick each refractory Ninny, And whisk't him back for the repenting Guinny, Is now grown Bankrupt, weary of his Life, And almost Wild and Frantick as his Wife. Those that e'er while no mortal Sin could spy, So bad, so gross as Nonconformity, Are now become the only Malecontents, And each in sullen Sighs his Passion vents. Passive Obedience was all the clutter, But soon as their own Nails are par'd, they mutter: Dear Whigs, Dissenting Brethren, pray forbear To meet, Indulgence is a Royal Snare; The Declaration is a Trojan Horse; The Form's illegal, and the Matter worse. There is a Snake ith' Grass, that's all the Cry: Which is in short to give their Prince the lie, And charge the best of Kings with Treachery. Is this the Church of England's Loyalty? Sadly they toll their Bells, and wring their hands, Religion (that's their Tithe Pigs and Glebe Lands) The Protestant Religion now will fall, Bell and the Dragon will devour us all. These Jesuits are cruel cunning Elves, We would have none to spoil you but our selves. O tender zealous Spirits! sad condition! Idolatry will eat up Superstition; The Calf at Bethel fears the Calf at Dan: The Grid-Iron grumbles at the Frying-Pan. And now the Jacks have lost their wonted Prey, They fear the Sharks will carry all away. So Conjurers grow tow'rds their end in fear That their familiar Devil will them tear. But O ye Champions, bring forth now and shew The foreskins of the Philistines you slew. When in your Power, Popery favour found, And all the Cry was, Knock Dissenters down; Yet now ye bawl, Tyber the Thames will drown: But fear not Tribe of Smirk, if Popery must be, You'l find the Nuns are pretty Company; And if the fiery Trial should return, Most of you wet your selves too much to burn: At worst— 'Tis but conforming t'other step, and then Jure Divino Whip and Spur again. The Renegado Poet. Damon the Author of so great Renown, Whose Muse so long has entertain'd the Town, Grown old, and almost starv'd by th'jilting Jade, Resolv'd at last to try some other Trade; And to maintain the Family at home, Sets up, and scribbles for the Church of Rome, Yet e'er the Apostate left the sinking Stage, He thus broke forth in a Poetick rage. What sullen Planet rul'd my angry Fate, And mark'd me out to be unfortunate! For of all Plagues with which Mankind is curs'd, That of being doom'd a Poet is the worst. Despis'd and out at Heels, he spends his days In Rhyme, to get the name of Poet Bays: When big with thought to ease the lab'ring Brain, He vents it in a Panegyrick strain; Basely he prostitutes his Muses Fame, To some rich Booby Lord, or Statesman's Name; Calls him both Wise and Generous, tho he be Like Dover dull, or Churchill niggardly. If some good Piece the rhyming Drudg has writ, He gives the Booby leave to father it; Then crys it up, and while he wou'd make known His Patron's Wit, slily commends his own. To scrible Songs and tender Elegies, Is what a Man of Credit shou'd despise: For such small Jobs Ousley alone is fit, Bob has the great retailing Trade of Wit; Let him of Lawra's Cruelty complain, Follow his flying Daphne still in vain. His Wit and Shape must unsuccessful prove, For both so heavy are they ne'er can move, The one to stay, the other Nymph to love. No more than Cholmly's Billets deux have done, Tho like Quack-bills dispers'd all o'er the Town: But if at last into a Ballad turn'd, And by some famous Wooden Cut adorn'd, Pleas'd with the Tune, and by some thoughts betray'd, The moving Lines charm some poor Chambermaid; Well may the Poet triumph in his Wit, For 'tis the greatest Conquest he can get. In pointed Satyr to reform the Age, Who but an hot-brain'd Zealot would ingage? Let a disbanded Peer kick'd out oth' Court, And made some upstart Statesman's common sport, Sneak like a Dog, and beg he may be sent With a great Character to Banishment. Since he is pleas'd to be made such a Tool, What is't to me? why must I call him Fool? If an aspiring Wretch himself to raise, Inslaves his Country and his God betrays, Like a proud Villain: say whate'er you can, You'l never make him turn an honest Man. He's still a Villain, but what has been said At last falls heavy on the Author's Head; The cudgel'd Poet by experience finds The tough Bamboon smarts sharplier than his Lines. Since then with Poetry so ill I've thriven, I will turn Casuist, and write for Heaven; Not that I love its Cause, but that I hope To find a better Patron of the Pope. The Tribe of Levi. Since Plagues were order'd for a Scourge to Men, And Egypt sore was chastned with her Ten; No greater Plague did any State molest, Than the severe, the lasting Plague, a Priest. Some Savage Beasts, by Laws of Nature bound, Only in Woods and desert Lands are found; No Land, no Climate, can this Monster bind, But like some Hydra multiplies his Kind, Through th'extended Orb directs his Course, And is at best a Universal Curse. Ah happy Albion, to the Gods most dear! How bright thy Rocks and fertile Lands appear! The Oceans glory, and its Nymphs delight, The Nations Terror by thy Men of Might. Thrice happy Albion! had there ne'er possest Thy spacious Kingdoms, the consuming Priest! Who Locust-like the Nations overspread, In every place a Priest erects his Head. These as the Fishes in the Water breed, And on the Fat of all the Pastures feed. Nor are they satisfy'd to have a Pow'r To drain the Nation, and its Fat devour; But like the Devil always bent on Ill, They plot new Mischiefs and Devices still; Their unknown Virtues do the Crowd deceive; What priestly Knaves report, dull Fools believe. Nor is a Prince (how great so e'er he be) From their Deceit and studied Malice free; Like Fiends ascending from the House of Smoke, They all around the gilded Palace flock, And in the Ears of Monarchy they sing, That had they not been Priests he'ad ne'er been King. Set off with Titles and a Specious Name, They quickly set the wondring World on flame. Methinks I hear its burden'd Axels break, And of the Priests dead Weight distinctly speak; The senseless Elements together moan, And all around the vast Creation groan. Ye juster Deities, true Friends to Men, Assist my Muse and guide my fainting Pen; A generous Passion raise within my Breast, That may affect the vilest Monster, Priest; Let my Muse lash, the Strokes be bold and good, As if my Pen were Steel, my Ink were Blood. Close by those Banks, the Banks where Silver Thames Still glides along with unpolluted Streams, A Fabrick stands, no Storm of Fate molests, From its Foundation was possest by Priests; Here Levi lives, o'ergrown with Sin and Years, Good God, what Lewdness lurks in hoary Hairs! As chief of Priests, Imperial Sway does bear, For he alone is God's Vicegerent here; His lesser Villains of the Church are Slaves, For he that's chief of Priests is chief of Knaves. 'Twas this same Levi did our James enthrone, And when h' had done, as basely pull'd him down: The Levites first his Sovereign Will declar'd, The Levites first his Sovereign Will debar'd. And thus old Levi, through mistaken fame, Had got a Patriot's and a Martyr's Name; Him th'unstable Mob with Praises grac'd, And thus his Humour for his Conscience past: Morose and peevish, insolently proud, Levi would stoop to none but to the Crowd, Who, e'er the Rabble could his Blessings crave, His Apostolick Benedictions gave. Unhappy James! prepostrous was the Fate That brought on thee the Clergys frown and hate. Hadst thou our Civil Rights and Charters took, Not half a word the Clergy then had spoke: But to molest the Church, was to depose God's holy Blockheads, and set up his Foes. Now foreign Troops invited o'er the Main, Come to disturb the Scenes of thy short Reign. Grown mad with fear when thou hadst lost the Day, And in inglorious haste didst run away, Our pious Levi loyally came down T'invite our future Monarch to the Town. How beggarly's the Crown! how mean the State, That does depend on Bishops love or hate! Nor can Conventions now make him a King, Till Levi does the Regal Vestments bring: In vain's your Reasoning, in vain your Toil, If Levi but keep back th'anointing Oil. 'Twas not for this the Hero was brought o'er, No, but to settle Church as 'twas before, To beat his Dad, and call his Mother Whore. Should he be crown'd, Levi's Designs are crost, The Juggle too of the Succession lost. If James be reinthron'd, we must ascribe His Restoration unto Levi's Tribe: And thus the Hierarchy of course bears Rule, And the weak Monarch is the Bishop's Tool; None but the Church should keep their Civil Rights, And all Dissenters be but Gibeonites. So much these Arguments with Levi sway'd, That he aside his Faith and Conscience laid; At once the Sanhedrim and God forsook, And to his own pernicious Counsels took; Rather than have his Priests left in the lurch, Would damn himself only to save the Church. Thus in a fret he to his Cell retires, To plot new Mischiefs, and blow up new Fires. Had this Retirement been well design'd, Only to ease the Plague of Human Kind, Levi, thy Absence then we ne'er should mourn, Nor been ambitious of thy loath'd Return. But since thy Den's become the Lion's Court, Whither in black the Beasts of Prey resort, May'st thou from thence thy final Journey take, And on some Gibbet thy just Exit make. Nor shalt thou Corah, now my Hand is in, Escape the justest Censure of my Pen; Corah, in the lewd List must next take place, To Man and to Religion a disgrace. In him, when young, the Priestly Sign appears, Did promise Mischief in his tender Years, No cost was wanting to provide him Tools, To pass the learned Drudgery of the Schools, Where Youth is with the Laws Corruption fed, Where Priests are form'd, and holy Cheats are bred. Their slavish Tenents much our Corah lov'd, And in the Tricks of Priesthood soon improv'd. He from the Pulpit did his Doctrine breath, And shed his Venom on the Crowd beneath: He taught that Kings might govern by their Will, And like the Gods themselves could ne'er do ill; That Princes had an arbitrary Power, And might their Subjects, when they pleas'd, devour; That God all Reason gave to Kings and Priests, And that all Men besides were only Beasts. But when his Lion from the Throne was driven, Disown'd by all good Men and juster Heaven, A King set up the Nations all approv'd, A King that God and all the People lov'd: Our treacherous Corah had his Faith forgot, And turn'd his fam'd Obedience to a Plot; His scruplous Conscience would not let him swear, Whilst Father liv'd, Obedience to the Heir; But in the Head of a Rebellious Race, As void of moral Vertues as of Grace, Corah the new-made Monarch did disown, And since the other went, each Action done; Until King William's Fate resounds from far, His great Success and Enterprize in War, And Fame aloud does of his Fortunes tell, How by his hand the Sons of Corah fell. Now Corah is become a milder Priest, And swears as well as any of the rest. Priests are like Spaniels ne'er inclin'd to good, No longer than they see or feel the Rod. Ah William, had I but thy Scepter Royal! By Heaven I'd beat the Dogs till they were Loyal. Ungrateful Corah! I'll bid thee adieu; Since God hath left thee, I will leave thee too: Nor shall my Satyr e'er disturb thy Life, Since thou hast got a Satyr in a Wife. Dathan must next be from Oblivion freed, Who in the Field obtain'd the Bishops Meed; Was bred a Soldier, now by Trade a Priest, Tho not so wise or learn'd as are the rest. He seldom does to preaching make pretence, But does excuse it by his want of Sense. Yet Dathan never like his Tribe was mad, Nor were his Crimes so great or half so bad; Dathan did never question his Belief, But pinn'd his Faith upon his Father's Sleeve; Sometimes was in the right, but vary'd soon, And chang'd his loose Opinion with the Moon. Dathan did with King William's Interest close, Yet like a Sot encourag'd all his Foes. Who but wise Dathan would his Sense prefer, And take the part of a Petitioner? Favour the City Mob, so lately fam'd, For Murderers and Evidences nam'd? Yet Dathan, though thy Crimes too far exceed, I'll pardon all thy Faults for one good Deed. But damn'd Abiram must my Anger feel, Whose Lewdness is as deep, as black as Hell, Such as a Muse, scarce as Old Nick, can tell. Abiram did late Jemmy's Will controul, And made a Seventh in the famous Roll: Abiram with 'em enter'd his Protest, And grew as saucy as did all the rest; But now his Conscience does by Levi's square, And his leud Thoughts with Levi's Notes compare. Levi to God nor to the Kingdom true, The elder Brother of the factious Crew; He chose Abiram out of all the Tribe, To be his Secretary and his Scribe, Who best to Mr. Redding might present The Strength and Weakness of the Government; How stiff the Levites to his Interest stood, As true as Steel and firm as Oaken Wood. But poor Abiram does the Toil endure, Whilst Levi in his Cell does sit secure: Levi of Freedom knew the worth and price, And therefore sent the Fools to break the Ice. Tho some in forming Plots may well agree, Yet few think good to hang for Company: But poor Abiram! it would vex a Stone, To plot in Numbers, and to hang alone. Yet never at thy Destiny repine, Hanging's the fittest Death for a D?ne; For who does ever at the Gallows swing, But e'er he's turned off a Psalm does sing? And tho thou art a dire Example made, Thou'lt leave the World in thy own way of Trade. Nor must Abiatbar be here forgot, For he that well can write can make a Plot: Of any Faith he never maketh doubt, But like the Wind his Conscience veers about. In lofty Strains he Tyrant Noll did praise, And to his Fame a lasting Statue raise; Who in Usurper's praise employ their Pens, Have no Affection to their lawful Prince. Whate'er pretence to Priesthood may belong, Gold is their God, and Glory guides their Tongue; These even Beelzebub have quite outdone, In Priest thy Athens Plagues are cram'd in one. But now my Muse another Story tells; Pray hear the Sound of pious Aaron's Bells, Whose Strength of Zeal suppresses that of Sense, Where Flesh does fail, Devotion does commence: Tir'd with Age, of youthful Vigor free, He is devout of meer Necessity; His great Austerity his Tribe does sute, He sometimes rides, but oftner walks on foot: Such pageant Zeal attendeth Bishopricks, He well may walk, where follows Coach and Six. Nor can he pray, but where his Pictures stand, To fix his Zeal, and wandring Thoughts command. These Images do pious Heats confer, And raise Devotion up the Lord knows where; He soars so high, and to the Clouds does grow, He quite forgets all Loyalty below, Can take no Oath nor swallow any Test, But must be stubborn as are all the rest. Let lasting Infamy curst Zadoc damn, Who maketh all Religion but a Sham: Zadoc who boasts of Fighting, Drinking, Roaring, And above all his mighty Strength in Whoring; Yet to debauch his Conscience now is loth, And swears by God he cannot take the Oath: Let Zadoc to his Sins stand firm and stiff, Till Triple Tree shall take the Triple F? Next in the List must Eleazar come, A Foe to England, and a Friend to Rome. Priests in Divinity take little Pains, And with Religion seldom crack their Brains. This want of Sense made Eleazar run The first to worship the arising Sun. When Brother Priests arrived here from Rome, Good Eleazar did invite them home: He took his Coach, and mighty Stir he made To be assistant at the Cavalcade; But yet thy Coachman, as the Act exprest, By most was thought the better sort of Priest; He would not drive, nor Rome's black Friends adore, When thou were but Postilion to the Whore; Whilst honest Slash did for his Freedom strive, Thou like the Devil unto Rome didst drive: Thy Brethren banish'd by the present Reign, Thou long'st to view and welcome here again. Not the lewd Levites which arrive from Rome, Are greater Villains than our Priests at home: The Church's Warriors of thy py-bald Band, That plague the Natives of this wretched Land, That blow the Coals and warmer Blood ferment, To cause a Fever in the Government. I'll mention but one more and then have done, 'Tis fighting Josuah the Son of Nun: Though he to Men of Sense is a Buffoon, He serves to make a Spiritual Dragoon. What tho he cannot preach, or pray or write, He 'gainst his Country and his King can fight. He's strongly armed with a double Sword, To fight God's Battels and to preach his Word. What Wonders in the Field were lately done, By fighting Josuah the Son of Nun? He bravely Monmouth and his Force withstood, And made the Western Land a Field of Blood; There Josuah did his reaking Heat asswage, On every Sign-post gibbet up his Rage; Glutted with Blood like some most Christian Turk, And scarce out-done by Jefferies or Kirk: Yet now the Priest is grown a Rebel too, And what Monmouthians did, himself can do. Since thou like them art equally to blame, Their Fate was to be hang'd, be thine the same. Should I of all the lesser Villains tell, It would a great, a bulky Volume fill, Fit for the Devil's Library in Hell. Should I their Lewdness and their Crimes relate, Their Lusts, their Perjuries, their Envy, Hate, Their filthy Drunkenness, their height of Pride, Their Avarice, yet Luxury beside, Their want of Goodness and their want of Sense, And their Repentance in the future Tense, Their new-coin'd Tenets which the Pulpits fill, Would tire out Pelling's Passive Lungs to tell. Hophnie of old laid down his rampant Whore, And thump'd her Carcase at the Temple-Door: But who can tell what Tricks our Priests do use Behind the Altar and within the Pews? The antient Levites (as the times then stood) Were Men of Cruelty and Men of Blood; The far more harmless Bulls they did surprize, And near the Altar slew the Sacrifice. Altho the Butcher now does not take place, The Cruelty's entail'd upon the Race; Our Priests are all descended from that Stem, Nero and Aretine are Saints to them; They oft the Blood of War in Peace have spill'd, How many Prisons has their Malice fill'd? How many Widows have they made a Prey? What Goods the holy Guzmans stole away! Well may they grieve now, having lost the Power By which they Widows Houses did devour: That Land's accurst, hath reason to lament, Where Priests are made a piece of Government; They damn our Souls and lead us weary Lives, Mislead our Daughters and debauch our Wives: Whatever shew of Zeal the Priesthood paints, They are at best but cuckoldizing Saints, The pious Vermin that molest a State, The Source of all Disorder and Debate; The Bane of Princes, a tumultuous Crew, Not satisfy'd with what is old or new. For James they underwent a wondrous Toil, And greas'd his Head with their anointing Oil; But when he to the Jesuits tack'd about. They as the Devil with Pray'r cast him out. Nor are they with their new-made Monarch glad, (The Priests have still a Privilege to be mad) Tho easy, gentle, and averse to Blood, His only Crime, he's to his Foes too good; Well may he have the Priests to be his Foes, That even God Almighty would depose. CLITO: A Poem on the Force of Eloquence. By Mr. Toland. Clito the Wise, the Generous, and Good, Better than whom none ever understood Or Things Or Words, would yet distinctly know How far the Force of Eloquence could go To teach Mankind those Truths which they mistake, And who the noble Task durst undertake. To him ADEISIDÆMON thus replies: O thou, whose Age my younger Years supplies With Virtue's Precepts, and my Country's Love, What Laws below, or Pow'rs there be above, Made bold by thy Example, and the Fame Of antient Heroes (whose immortal Name Might serve alone all Errors to reform) I shall the welcome Labour thus perform. In common Words I vulgar things will tell, And in Discourse not finely speak, but well. My Phrase shall clear, short, unaffected be, And all my Speech shall like my Thoughts be free; Not grave enough to fright the Young away, Nor yet for elder Company too gay. But when the Crowd I'm chosen to persuade By long Orations for the purpose made; Or by, what reaches more with more success, The labour'd Compositions of the Press: Then shall my fertile Brain new Terms produce, Or old Expressions bring again in use, Make all Ideas with their Signs agree, And sooner things than Words shall wanting be. Harmonious Sounds th'attentive Ear shall please, While artful Numbers Passions lay or raise; Commanding Vigor shall my Thoughts convey, And Softness seal the Truth of all I say: I'll sooth the raging Mob with mildest Words, Or sluggish Cowards rouse to use their Swords. As furious Winds sweep down whate'er resists, So shall my Tongue perform whate'er it lists, With large impetuous Floods of Eloquence Tickle the Fancy and bewitch the Sense; Make what it will the justest Cause appear, And what's perplex'd or dark look bright and clear. Not that I would the wrongful Side defend; He best protects who's ablest to offend: As the same Force which serves to curb our Foes, Can hurt those Friends who on our Love repose, And for whose sake we would our Lives expose. Thus arm'd, thus strong, thus fitted to perswade, I'll Truth protect, and Error strait invade, Dispel those Clouds that darken human Sight, And bless the World with Everlasting Light. A noble Fury does possess my Soul, Which all may forward, nothing can controul; The fate of Beings, and the hopes of Men, Shall be what pleases my creating Pen. Who form'd the Universe, and when and why, Or if all things were from Eternity; What Laws to Nature were prescrib'd by Jove; Where lies his chiefest Residence above; Or if he's only but the World's great Soul; Or Parts the Creatures are, and God the Whole From whence all Beings their Existence have, And into which resolv'd they find a Grave; How nothing's lost, tho all things change their Form, As that's a Fly which was but now a Worm; And Death is only to begin to be Some other thing, which endless change shall see; (Then why should Men to die have so great fear? Tho nought's Immortal, all Eternal are.) Whether the Stars be numerous Suns, or no, And what's their Use above, or Pow'r below; What Planets are inhabited, what not; How many new emerg'd, what old forgot; If the dull Earth does turn about the Sun, Or that bright Phebus round this Globe does run; Whence the Magnetic Force; how VVinds can blow; What makes the Ocean duly ebb and flow; How come th'alternate Seasons of the Year, And why the VVeather's warm, cold, dull or clear; How Animals and Plants increase their Kind; And what's the Source of Life, of Soul or Mind; How Stones and Metals, Sands or Shells are fram'd, Shall only after me be rightly nam'd. Thus quick as Thought I unconfin'd will fly Thro boundless Space and vast Eternity; Nature to me appears in no disguize, Nor can one Atom scape my prying Eyes. O Glorious Liberty! for thee I'll prove The firmest Patron that e'er Tongue did move; I'll always execute what you decree, And be the fatal Scourge of Slavery. Ambitious Tyrants, proud and useless Drones, I'll first expose, then tumble from their Thrones: Some their foul Crimes shall expiate by Death, And some in Exile draw their hated Breath. Their warlike Troops I shall with ease disband, And conquer those who all besides command; I've known a Senate with some magic Words To Forks and Spades transform their bloody Swords, Those hect'ring Braves, who vaunt their Force so loud, A Patriot's Tongue can humble with the Crowd. Our fearless Youth (if these are at an end) Will their own Rights by their own Arms defend, And punish Nations when they dare offend. But, by the Soul of him who Julius kill'd, When I perceive that Oracle fulfill'd, Which was to me pronounc'd by Men Divine, That All goes well when Whigs and Tories join; I'll sing the Triumphs of the Good Old Cause, Establish Justice, reinthrone the Laws, Restore the Nation to its perfect health, Then Pow'r usurp'd destroy, and form a Common-wealth. But what in faint Ideas I conceive, A matchless Hero will by Facts atchieve; That Freedom he restor'd he will maintain, Incourage Merit, and leud Vice restrain. Our Laws, Religion, Arms, our Coin and Trade, All flourish under him, before decay'd; In this more safe, more mighty and renown'd, Than if ten thousand Successors he crown'd: For oft a just and valiant Prince's Name Degenerate Sons by horrid Crimes defame. Her Brutus Rome had not so long ador'd, If he had made himself her Sov'reign Lord. O Godlike Brutus! for thy Country's good Thou didst not shrink to shed thy Childrens Blood! And sure at home if thou wer't so severe, Thou'dst never labour for a foreign Heir. But more than Tongues can speak, or Pens improve, The World and I expect from William's Love, His People's Darling, Heav'ns peculiar Care, The Branch of Peace, and Thunderbolt of War. Thrice happy they who see thy Youth renew'd, O potent Britain! thy worst Foes subdu'd, The proudest Kingdoms for thy Friendship sue, And all free States their Safety place in you. Their Products East and West shall send to thee, Both Indies gladly will thy Handmaids be; The North unlocks her adamantin Door, And what the South conceals thou shalt explore. Thy mighty Fleets our Honours will regain, And the Flag's Triumph e'ery where maintain. Thy Sons shall reap fresh Laurels near and far, Umpires of Peace and Leaders still in War. High Heaven alone shall o'er thy Buildings sway, And that alone be fairer thought than they. Submissive Kings shall on thy Senate wait, While Nations thence expect to hear their Fate. Let Learning then and Manners be thy care, The Proud to humble, the Distress'd to spare, And to free those who slavish Fetters wear. But what if Tyrants ne'er were heard of more? What serves it equal Freedom to restore, So long as other Monsters worse than they, Rule all Mankind with a despotic Sway? These are fit Objects of a Hero's rage; But where's the Herc'les to redeem the Age? No longer thus the World shall be misled By him that's falsly call'd th'unerring Head. His Triple Crown I scornfully will spurn, And his proud Seat to heaps of Rubbish turn, Fright all his Vassals into Dens and Caves, Then smoke to Death the sacrilegious Slaves. The swarming Herds of crafty Priests and Monks, The female Orders of Religious Punks, Cardinals, Patriarchs, Metropolitans, Franciscans, Jesuits, Dominicans, And such like barbarous Names Ecclesiastic, Such superstitious, villanous, fantastic, Coz'ning Rogues I'll evermore disturb, Sense shall their Doctrines, Force their Malice curb. Nor will I here desist; all Holy Cheats Of all Religions shall partake my Threats, Whether with sable Gowns they show their Pride, Or under Clokes their Knavery they hide, Or whatso'er disguise they choose to wear To gull the People while their Spoils they share. As much as we revere those worthy Men, Whe teach what's peaceful, necessary, plain; So much we should such Hypocrites impeach, As only Jargon, Strife, and Empire preach. Religion's safe, with Priestcraft is the War; All Friends to Priestcraft, Foes of Mankind are. Their impious Fanes and Altars I'll o'erthrow, And the whole Farce of their feign'd Saintship show; Their pious Tricks disclose; their murd'ring Zeal, And all their awful Mysteries reveal; Their lying Prophets, and their jugling Thieves Discredit quite; their foolish Books (as Leaves From Trees in Autumn fall) I'll scatter wide, And show those Fables which they fain would hide. When I've perform'd these Feats, new Danger calls; From Earth I'll soar, and scale high Heaven's Walls To pull false Gods from thence, that Men may see There's but One, True, All-perfect Deity. Sound Reason is the Law that likes him best, Of Good and Ill the never-erring Test. His Sacred Temple's e'ery good Man's Heart, Where his choice Gifts he freely does impart; But they deserve and share his first Applause, Who stake their Lives in their dear Country's Cause. An honest Mind is the best Pray'r he needs; Paid with good Works, for him no Victim bleeds. With Forms and Postures he is never pleas'd. Nor is his Wrath with Bribes to be appeas'd: But, happy in himself, he neither wants Ought we can give; nor greater Blessings grants Than solid Sense, and an industrious Pain, Riches with this, Wisdom with that to gain. From this high Steep with hasty flight I'll bend, And to the Bosom of the Earth descend; To those dark Shades I'll introduce the Day, And the vain Terrors of Hell's Court display. But wicked Deeds shall not unpunish'd go, Tho not as Priests and Poets falsly show. Those Old-Wives Tales, imaginary Fears, The Cause of Horror, and the Source of Tears, I'll soon destroy; extinguish all their Flames, Dry up their Rivers, break their ratling Chains, Poison their Serpents, fright each hideous Form, Cerberus choke, and Pluto's Castle storm. Legions of Fiends to Atoms I'll reduce, And leave bad Men no Tempter for excuse, But such leud Thoughts as their vain Fancy draws, Rebels to Reason's just and easy Laws. The best Repentance is to sin no more, And to the Owners what they've lost restore. Hell's always flaming in a Villain's Mind, Who's self-condemn'd, abhor'd of all Mankind, And still suspicious of a Fo behind. Virtue's its own Reward; nor Rage of Foes, Nor Frowns of Friends can Virtue discompose. Tho Malice, Fraud, and Envy may combine, Spite of their Fury Innocence will shine. An honest man, when thousands treat him ill, His conscious Virtue will support him still; Till undeceiv'd, the World repairs his Fame, Life yields him Honour, Death a glorious Name. Thus pow'rful Eloquence shall teach the Wise Vile and absurd Inventions to despise; And Fools will mend when abler men exhort, Or by strict Laws are kept from doing hurt. But as no Rule without exception is, So Fools in Learning come not under this: For neither Brains nor Books make them improve, Nor Laws restrain, so much they Mischief love. The easiest things they speak in Terms uncouth, And empty Notions hug for solid Truth. Sworn Foes to Reason, whose resistless Light Condemns their Pride and Ignorance to Night: Slaves to Authority, the Bane of Schools, Because all Times have Precedents for Fools. If in right ways I cannot such direct, I'll spoil their Trade, their Vanity detect. As sick men order'd by their Doctors Bills To breath that Air which quickly cures or kills; So shall my Words like Thunderbolts be hurl'd, And will confound or mend the erring World. But when from Cares and publick Business free, Bright Victorina my lov'd Theme shall be; The softest Words the sweetest Things will tell, And all I write or speak be fine and well. When she inspires, I must great things pursue; If she approv'd, what Wonders cou'd I do? I shou'd than all to come discover more, And would eclipse those Lights which shin'd before. But her dear Image calms my raging Breast, All should be still to lodg so fair a Guest, Who hating me, I'm curst; or loving, ever blest. Thus far I spoke; and Clito all approv'd, Except what last was said of her I lov'd. He did not blame my Passion, and allow'd A virtuous Woman's Heart might well be woo'd; But that her Hate (like other Ills) the Wise Shou'd soften first, or missing that, despise: For Cowards lose by a too quick Despair What's gain'd by nobler Souls who persevere, And in Success or Merit Victors are. We part; and each went where he wish'd to be, I to my Study, to his Garden He. Some Verses sent by a Friend to one who twice ventur'd his Carcase in Marriage. The Husband's the Pilot, the Wife is the Ocean, He always in danger, she always in motion; And he that in Wedlock twice hazards his Carcase, Twice ventures the Drowning, and Faith that's a hard case. Even at our own Weapons the Females defeat us, And Death, only Death can sign our Quietus. Not to tell you sad Stories of Liberty lost, Our Mirth is all pall'd, and our Measures all crost; That Pagan Confinement, that damnable Station, Sutes no other State or Degree in the Nation. The Levite it keeps from Parochial Duty, For who can at once mind Religion and Beauty? The Rich it alarms with Expences and Trouble, And a poor Beast, you know, can scarce carry double. 'Twas invented they tell you to keep us from falling, O the Virtues and Graces of shrill Caterwawling! How it palls in your Gain; but pray how do you know Sir. How often your Neighbour breaks in your Inclosure? For this is the principal Comforts of Marriage, You must eat tho a hundred have spit in your Porridg. If at night you're unactive, or fail in performing, Enter Thunder and Lightning, and Blood-shed next Morning; Lust's the Bone of your Shanks, O dear Mr. Horner, This comes of your sinning with Crape in a Corner. Then to make up the Breach all your Strength you must rally, And labour and sweat like a Slave in a Gally; And still you must charge, O blessed Condition! Tho you know, to your cost, you've no more Ammunition: Till at last the poor Tool of a mortified Man Is unable to make a poor Flash in the Pan. Fire, Flood, and Female begin with a Letter, But for all the World's not a Farthing the better. Your Flood is soon gone, and your Fire you must humble, If into the Flames Store of Water you tumble; But to cure the damn'd Lust of your Wife's Titillation, You may use all the Engins and Pumps in the Nation, As well you may piss out the last Conflagration. And thus I have sent you my Thoughts of the matter, You may judg as you please, I scorn for to flatter; I could say much more, but here ends the Chapter. Signior Dildoe by the E. of Rochester, 1678. 1 You Ladies all of merry England, Who have been to kiss the Dutchess's Hand, Pray did you not lately observe in the Show A noble Italian, call'd Signior Dildoe? 2 This Signior was of her Dutchesses Train, And help'd to conduct her over the Main; But now she cries out to the Duke, I will go, I have no more need for Signior Dildoe. 3 At the Sign of the Cross in St. James's Street, When next you go thither to make your selves sweet, By buying of Powder, Gloves, Essence or so, You may chance to get sight of Signior Dildoe. 4 You would take him at first for no Person of note, Because he appears in a plain Leather Coat; But when you his vertuous Abilities know, You would fall down and worship Signior Dildoe. 5 My Lady Southesk, Heaven prosper her for't, First cloth'd him in Sattin, then brought him to Court; But his Head in the Circle he scarcely durst show, So modest a Youth was Signior Dildoe. 6 The good Lady Suffolk thinking no harm, Had got this poor Stranger hid under her Arm: Lady Betty by chance came the Secret to know, And from her own Mother stole Signior Dildoe. 7 The Countess of Falmouth, of whom People tell, Her Footmen wore Shirts of a Guinea an Ell, Might save that Expence, if she did but know, How lusty a Swinger is Signior Dildoe. 8 By the help of this Gallant the Countess of Rafe, Against the fierce Harris preserv'd her self safe; She stifled him almost beneath her Pillow, So closely she embraced Signior Dildoe. 9 That Pattern of Vertue her Grace of Cl?land Has swallow'd more P?s than the Nation has Land; But by rubbing and scrubbing so wide it does grow, It is fit for just nothing but Signior Dildoe. 10 Our dainty fine Dutchess having got a Trick, To dote on a Fool for the sake of his— The Fops were undone, did their Graces but know The Discretion and Vigour of Signior Dildoe. 11 The Dutchess of M?na tho she looks high, With such a Gallant is contented to lie; And lest the English her Secrets should know, For her Gentleman Usher took Signior Dildoe. 12 The Countess of the Cockpit (who knows not her Name?) She's famous in Story for a killing Dame; When all her old Lovers forsake her, I trow, She'l then be contented with Signior Dildoe. 13 Red Howard, red Sheldon, and Temple so tall, Complain of his Absence so long from Whitehall; Signior Barnard has promis'd a Journy to go, And bring back his Country-man Signior Dildoe. 14 Moll. Howard no longer with his Highness must range, And therefore is proffered this civil Exchange; Her Teeth being rotten, she smells best below, And needs must be fitted for Signior Dildoe. 15 St. Albans with Wrinkles and Smiles in his Face, Whose Kindness to Strangers becomes his high Place, In his Coach and six Horses is gone to pergo, To take the fresh Air with Signior Dildoe. 16 Were this Signior but known to the Citizen Fops, He'd keep their fine Wives from the Foremen of their Shops; But the Rascals deserve their Horns should still grow, For burning the Pope and his Nephew Dildoe. 17 Tom. Killigrew's Wife, that Holland's fine Flower, At the sight of this Signior did fart and belch sour; And her Dutch Breeding further to show, Says, Welcome to England Myne Heer Van Dildoe. 18 He civilly came to the Cockpit one night, And proffer'd his Service to fair Madam Knight; Quoth she, I intreague with Captain Cazzo, Your Nose in mine A—good Signior Dildoe. 19 This Signior is sound, safe, ready and dumb, As ever was Candle, Carrot, or your Thumb; Then away with these nasty Devices, and show How you rate the just Merit of Signior Dildoe. 20 Count Cazzo, who carries his Nose very high, In Passion he swore his Rival should die, Then shut himself up to let the World know, Flesh and Blood could not bear it from Signior Dildoe. 21 A Rabble of P?s who were welcome before, Now finding the Porter denied them the Door, Maliciously waited his coming below, And inhumanly fell on Signior Dildoe. 22 Nigh wearied out, the poor Stranger did fly, And along the Pall Mall they followed full Cry; The Women concern'd, from every Window Cry'd, O for Heaven's sake save Signior Dildoe. 23 The good Lady Sands burst into a Laughter, To see how the B?ks came wobbling after; And had not their Weight retarded the Foe, Indeed it had gone hard with Signior Dildoe. The Encouragement by the E. of Rochester. 'Tis the Arabian Bird alone Lives chast, because there is but one; But had Dame Nature made them two, They would like Birds and Sparrows do. [In all Humility we crave] The Commons Petition to the King, by the E. of Rochester. In all Humility we crave Our Sovereign may be our Slave, And humbly beg that he may be Betray'd to us most loyally; And if he pleases to lay down His Scepter, Dignity, and Crown, We'l make him for the time to come The greatest Prince in Christendom. King's Answer. Charles at this time having no need, Thanks you as much as if he did. A Satyr by the Lord Rochester, which King Charles took out of his Pocket. Preserv'd by Wonder in the Oak, O Charles, And then brought in by the Duke of Albemarle; The first by Providence, the next all Devil, Shews th'art a Compound made of Good and Evil: The Bad we've too long known, the Good's to come, But not expected till the day of Doom. Was ever Prince's Soul so meanly poor, To be a Slave to every little Whore? The Seaman's Needle nimbly points the Pole, But thine still points to every craving Hole; Which Wolf-like in that Breast raw Flesh devours, And must be fed all Seasons and all Hours. C? is the Mansion House where thou dost dwell, But thou art fix'd as Tortoise to her Shell, Whose Head peeps out a little now and then To take the Air, and then creeps in agen. Strong is thy Lust, in C? thou'rt always diving, And I dare swear thou pray'st to die a S?. How poorly squanderst thou thy Seed away, Who should get Kings for Nations to obey? But thou poor Prince so uselesly hast sown it, That the Creation is asham'd to own it; Witness the Royal Lives sprung from the Belly Of thy anointed Princess Madam Nelly, Whose first Employment was with open Throat To cry fresh Herrings, even Ten a Groat: Then was by Madam Ross expos'd to Town, I mean to those who would give half a Crown: Next in the Play-house she took her Degree, As Men commence at University. No Doctors till they've Masters been before, So no Players till they've been a Whore. Look back and see the People mad with Rage, To see the Bitch in such an Equipage; And every day that they the Monster see, They let 10000 Curses fly at thee: Allow'd in publick Streets they use thee thus, And none dare check them they're so numerous, Stopping the Bank in thee was only great, But in a Subject it had been a Cheat. To pay thy Debts what Sum canst thou advance, Now thy Exchequer is remov'd to France, T'inrich a Harlot all made up of French, Not worthy to be call'd a Whore, but Wench? Cl?land indeed deserves that noble Name, Whose monstrous Lechery exceeds all Fame; The Empress Messaline was cloy'd with Lust at last, But you could never satisfy this Beast: Cl?land, I say, is much to be admir'd, Altho she ne'er was satisfi'd or tir'd. Full 40 Men a day provided for this Whore, Yet, like a Bitch, she wags her Tail for more. Where are the Bishops now? Where are their Bawdy Court; Instead of Penance, they indulge the Sport; For standing in white Sheets their Penance cools, And's only fit for Frenchmen and for Fools. O Heavens! wert thou for this loose Life preserv'd? Are there no Gods nor Laws to be observ'd? Nineveh repented after forty Days; Be yet a King, and wear the Royal Bays: But Jonas Threats will ne'er awaken thee, Repentance is too mean for Majesty. Go practise Heliogabalus his Sin, Forget to be a Man, and learn to spin; Go dally with the Women on their Wheels, Till Nero-like they pull thee out by th'Heels: Go read what Mahomet did (that was a thing Did well become the Grandeur of a King) Who all transported with his Mistress Charms, And never pleas'd but in her lovely Arms; Yet when his Janizaries wish'd her dead, With his own Hand cut off Irene's Head: Make such a Practice with thy self as this, Then thou mayst once more tast of Happiness; Each one will love thee, and the Parliament Will their unkind and stubborn Votes repent, And at your Feet lay open all their Purses, And give you all their Prayers unmix'd with Curses. All this I wish, altho I'm not your Friend, Till like a Child you promise to amend; If not, you'l find your Subjects rugged Stuff, But now I think on't, I have said enough. An Epitaph upon a Stumbling-Horse. Here lies a Horse beneath this Stone, Who living oft hath lain on one: A noble Steed, who as he went Proclaimed still his great Descent. A proudly headed Nag he was, And hence it often came to pass That he his Feet not valued, But still stood much upon his Head. He was no War-Horse, yet he knew The Art to squot and lie perdeu. Yet many a Horse long train'd in Wars Had never half so many Scars; There's only this small difference in't, Theirs were of Steel, and his of Flint. He was no Hunter, nor did care To follow Chase of Fox or Hare; Yet had this property of Hound, He still was smelling on the Ground. And tho Dame Nature did not frame Him for a finder of the Game, Yet were it lost, none certainly Would sooner stumble on't than he. He was no Racer, as some say, Tho some conclude the other way, And say for swiftness he might run Against the Horses of the Sun: For though full swift Don Phæbus be, This would be sooner down than he. For his Opinion, Critick Wit Does very much in guessing it. Some say he was Conformist Breed, He bow'd so low: but some this Steed Think may for Nonconformist go, At every thing he stumbles so. Some think him Presbyter, 'cause he Brings Rider down to Parity. But some say no; for by this knack He still throws Jockey from his back. Some think him Papist, 'cause so prone He was to worshipping of Stone. Some think again, that tripping he Confutes Infallibility; But most allow him, which is worse, No more Religion than a Horse. Well now he's dead, no wonder is't, For Mother Earth long since he kist; And what it was, full well did know To turn his heels up long ago. If any to inquire shall please What caus'd his death, 'twas a Disease Call'd Epilepse by learned Leech, But Falling-sickness in plain speech. And now good Coroner, since he hath By his own stumbling caus'd his death, In Kings High-way pray let him rest, With this Inscription on his Breast. Despise me not ye passing Steeds, Nor toss in scorn your lofty Heads: What mine is now, may be your lot; For where's the Horse that stumbles not? But since my Charity does enjoin To wish you milder fates than mine; When e'er it is your hap to stumble, Oh may you trip, but never tumble. Ad Populum Phaleræ: or the Twin-Shams. Of all the Cheats and Shams that have of late Shock'd our Religion, and embroil'd our State, None more abuse and leave us in the Lurch, Than those false Cries of Monarchy and Church: To these bewitching Sounds, these mighty Charms, We chiefly owe the Miseries and Harms That fill'd the two last Reigns: and tho at last Kind Heav'n an Eye upon our Bondage cast, And opportunely to our Rescue sent, These plague us still, and clog our Settlement. So when the Hebrew Chief, on Egypt's Strand, Such Wonders wrought by the Almighty's Hand, That the wish'd Freedom was almost obtain'd, Two Sham Magicians set it back again. I. For Monarchy; it is by all confess'd Our antient Government, that sutes us best; Our Legal Form, to which our Statutes bind, By Laws supported, and by Laws defin'd. And more what can be ask'd? But when this Name Shall sore an Heav'nly Pitch, and Kindred claim With Jove himself: when boundless Rule and free, Contemning Laws, shall fetch its Pedigree From sacred Writ, and be impos'd upon The World, on pain of dire Damnation; The Filmer's Tribe, with their Paternal Farce, Into one House shall cramp the Universe; That Noah's Heirs despoticly might rule, Altho a Cobler, Mad-man, Knave or Fool: When Hodge and Parker's Doctrines do revive, Which God Almighty's Pow'r to Monarchs give, To rule the World with such a perfect Sway, That they the Potters are, and we the Clay: We rub our Eyes, and quickly are aware What the Result of such wild Maxims are. For then our Laws are Mockery and Sport, Our Judges are but Heraulds to the Court. Our Antient Rolls, grown useless to preserve Our Rights, may then for Taylors Measures serve, Or Childrens Drums; our Property and Claims Are all but blustering Sounds and empty Names: Our Charters too are void, tho sworn and sign'd, For no Concessions Right Divine can bind. Who strives to limit such a Sov'reign Head, Fetters Levi'than with a single Thread: Heav'ns darling, he was only made to sport, And take his pastime in the Watry Court, Where all th'inferiour Mutes, and lesser Fry, Are but his Chattels, Goods and Property. Then talk of nat'ral Liberty no more, Equality of Souls is out of door, All, but of Kings, were stamp'd for Slaves and Poor. And were they visible, you might descry The native Badges of Servility: As Camels shew they were design'd for Packs, By nat'ral Pack-saddles upon their Backs. Such Notions well might sute the former Reigns, When French and Turkish Models fill'd our Brains, But under one who Champion comes to be Of England's, and of Europe's Liberty, Such Language needs must grate upon our Ears, And 'midst our Joys and Hopes, must whisper Fears. When such for Patriots pass, who t'other Day Were the known Tools of Arbitrary Sway; And those that English Laws and Freedoms plead, Republicans are presently decreed, Altho the Men that Crown'd our Prince's Head. When such Discourses fill the Town, what less, Can be design'd than James's Re-access? By blackning those who have so plainly shown Themselves the best Supporters of the Throne. Or else they fain would tempt the Royal Breast To more desire of Rule, than will consist With English Laws, or with his Oath and Word, That of his Subjects he might be abhorr'd; And so might pave the absent Prince's Way, And fall the Gallick Tyrant's easy Prey. But Heav'n, that at the Boyne its Power did shew, We hope will save him from these Flatt'rers too, More dangerous than grazing Ball that flew. II. But, O the Church! that, that's the second Cry, As very a Sham as that of Monarchy: For while the Letters in our Ears do ring, The Cabala is quite another thing. Some mean by Church down-right Debauchery; For tho our Church abhors such Villany, Yet when a Sot or Bully, reeking from Tavern or Brothel, to a Church doth come, Mumbling his Orisons without Regard, To charm his Conscience, more than to be heard, That he might sin a-fresh with greater Gust, (As Turks with Opium fortify their Lust) Then, Ah the Church! the Church! that sacred Name Must serve to hallow his impurer Flame; Cancel old Sins, and qualify for new, Give Absolution, and a Licence too. So when he hugs the Sanctuary-Walls, Himself a Saint, the Malefactor falls; Christens his Fears, and from the sacred Stone Hath turn'd his Flight into Devotion. So Temples were by Heathens made their Stews, And Dens of Thieves and Robbers by the Jews. So Eli's Sons, who at the very Doors Of the Assembly made the Women Whores, Were Church-men too, but to the Church's Cost; For by such Church-men soon the Ark was lost. With others, Name of Church doth signify A mere misplaced Zeal and Bigotry For Rites and Ceremonies, and these too The very worst and meanest of the Crew; Such as perhaps the Church might better spare, And more her Blemish than her Beauty are. Live as you list, this Man doth not regard; Infringe her Doctrines too, he is not stirr'd: But touch a Surplice, or an Eastern Nod, You wound his Darling, and blaspheme his God. Ask him but whence unlighted Candles came? And straight the Man himself is in a Flame: Speak but against the Cross, he'l read your doom, That you deserve to hang in Gismas Room: He'd rather have two Easters in a Year, Than to disturb the sacred Calendar. What most is scrupled, that he values most; And rather would have all Dissenters lost, Than old Translation should be refitted, Or Tobit and his Dog should be omitted. He joys when Service in the Chancel's read, Tho half the People hear not what is said. Adores an Organ, tho he needs must know That when the Heav'nly Boreas doth blow, The Sense too oft is murder'd by the Sound, And many a Psalm feloniously is drown'd. And if you do but lisp of Alteration, Then straight Vox Cleri must alarm the Nation: You're then Phanatick, Neuter, Half-way-man, Or mungrel Latitudinarian; You pull the Church down; for 'twill surely fall, If you but pick one Pebble from the Wall: Or tho you never move the smallest Stone, 'Tis Sacrilege to pull the Ivy down. So Pedants count themselves the best Orators, And Fops and Beaus the only Courtiers, So Dancing Masters walk the Fields by Rules, Whilst all the World proclaims them formal Fools. A third, by Church, mean Persecution, A right Church-militant with Sword and Gun: A Church that governs more by Fear than Love, And more hath of the Eagle than the Dove: A Church that into Swords doth beat her Shares, And all her Pruning-books converts to Spears. “Ah could we but these Vermin hunt to Death “By five and thirtieth of Elizabeth; “Or plague them by Imprisonment or Fine, “Until we had compell'd them to come in, “'Twere brave indeed! but since that's laid asleep, “And (which is still a Wound more wide and deep) “A free and legal Toleration “Is gain'd for all that do our Doctrines own; “What help remains, the Church doth gasping lie, “And all is lost beyond Recovery! But hold Sir! Is't impossible to save The Church's Life, and keep her from the Grave, Unless these Steel Prescriptions we have? Pray tell me how in Ages Primitive She made a shift to keep herself alive, And flourish'd too? Or else resolve me how All pious Pastors hold up Churches now By Preaching and good Life? and so may you. The way is open, imitate your Lord, And that alone will Followers afford: Most Men are not so giddy as to scorn Good Sermons more at Church than in a Barn, Or think an Heav'nly Life less fair doth look Under a Gown and Cassock than a Cloke. But if you rather choose to prop your Cause By violent and compulsory Laws, Which is Dragooning in the best Edition, (Or younger Brother to an Inquisition) Your Church will meet the Fate of Tyranny, Hated to live, and soon unpitied, die. The last of those pretended Cheats and Shams, Doth [by the Church] at bottom mean King James: Let one that's true to William's Interest (Altho as good a Churchman as the best) Attempt to stand at an Election, Straight he's a Whig: the Church is quite undone! But for a trusty Spark, that secretly Drinks James's Health, when knows his Company, They'l rend the Welkin with their bellowing Cry. There needs no Oedipus t'unriddle this; Church is the Apologue, and James the Moral is. But if you think indeed King James your Friend, And that your Church he'l mightily defend; Then pray, to do King Lewis Right, remember Give him the Stile too, of your Great Defender; Who list'ning to the Groans of the Oppress'd, In pure Compassion sent his Fleet from Brest. This would resolve the Question, whether France Came hither by Agreement or by Chance? Or if the last abortive Letter-Plot Was to be finish'd by French Force or not? And who must pay him his expended Pelf? Or if he wou'd not wisely pay himself? And ballancing the Charge against the Gains, Rescue the Church, and take it for his Pains? But whatsoever Int'rest was intended By French Invasion to be befriended, 'Tis all a Case, the Treason is the same, Whoe'er the Authors are; and if the Name Of Church must shelter ev'ry Plotting Knave, (As once the Ark did Toads and Vipers save) Both Church and State, so late at Ruin's Brink, Sav'd in a Storm, will in the Harbour sink. The CAMPAIGN. 1692. When People find their Money spent, They recollect which way it went, The like in order to prevent for th'Future. That Money's spent I need not tell, For what I know not very well, Unless to make Folks to Rebel or Tutor. But lest you think it spent in vain, And of our Hero's Acts complain, I will describe this last Campaign in Flanders. With Treasure, Ships, and Arms good store, To make the French (as we be) poor, He did embark with many more Commanders. While Cares were fighting in his Breast, And nothing left (but Wife) unprest, He took, not staying to be bless'd, his Ark Sir. Hastning to make some work for Verse, Fit for dull Dutchmen to rehearse, Where Wit and Courage are so scarce; d'ye mark Sir. He was no sooner set on shore, When News came Post that Luxembur' Had actually besieg'd Namur, nigh Liege Sir. This Action put him in amaze Fearing if he should make delays, It would be difficult to raise the Siege Sir. With that he muster'd all his Force, Full fourscore thousand Foot and Horse, That never flinch'd or hung an Arse when fighting. And march'd away with Noble Train; But all Endeavours prov'd in vain, There were such Storms of Thunder, Rain and Lightning. The filthy Season made him fret; Not that he fear'd the French a bit; But that it was such plaguy wet raw Weather. We boldly view'd their dirty Passes, And strong Retrenchments where no Grass is, And so retir'd like driven Asses together. For not attempting once to fight, Namur was taken in our sight, Though from the Town we lay not quite a Mile, Sir. The strength of Flanders so was won, And W? bravely saw it done, And unconcernedly lookt on the while, Sir. The Dutch, who better knew the Land, Found it too slippery to stand, And therefore would not be trapann'd, as we were. For so to Fight at any rate, Without Assurance of their Fate, Or a respect to Future State, is not fair. Low Country Courage thus express'd, His Highness thought it time to rest, And full three Months he took at least to do it. When so refresh'd, in hast he rose, And swore, (for 'twas his turn t'oppose) He'd be reveng'd, and make his Foes to rue it. To carry on this great Design, Early one Morning very fine, He did resolve to force their Line and Trenches. With Swords, and Guns, and Hand-Granadoes, He made his way through Ambuscadoes, And beat down some o'th Palisadoes of the Frenches. So there began a warm Dispute, The French were strong and held him to't; For Æsop order'd all his Foot to draw forth. When Two Fight, one must always beat, 'Tis said; but that's a meer deceit; For W? only did retreat, and so forth. He left indeed Six Thousand Dead, At least they were despirited, Twelve hundred, some say, were Pris'ners made, but I won't. The French did soon decamp we find, As if to Fight no more inclin'd, Leaving the Lord knows what behind, for I don't. What if this great Attempt did fail? He had another to prevail, That Monsieur might his Stars bewail with sorrow. Louis in hopes was made to fly, His Conquests left to W? to buy; To th'Commonwealth his Tyranny to borrow. 'Twas a Descent, you understand, On the French Coasts some Men to land, To rescue Traytors from the hand of Lewis. Old Laws of France there to restore, As England's he had done before; But some will ha't to break 'em more, most true is. Suppose all Kings alike for ease, And the Name only not to please, (Old Things with us are a Disease) 'twere madness. While Lewis's Glory does commence, T'exchange him for a creeping Prince, 'Twould be a vile Affront to Sense in sadness. The Ladies would forbid those Arts, To give away their King of Hearts, For one of less performing parts than le Grand. For One that ha'nt to show, God knows, So much to please 'em, as a Nose; Tho it may serve to spight his Foes, how ere't stand. But while our Champion was abroad, Mind how he kept the very Road He to his Cabinet had show'd, and went in. To drag our Landmen out to Sea, To use them ill, and keep their Pay, Strict Orders coming ev'ry Day from B?ting. With fifteen Thousand Men, and more, Five hundred Ships to waft them o'er, With sixty Cannons that would roar like Thunder. Some fifty Mortars great and small, Bombs, Carcases, the Devil and all, And bloody Threats sent from Whitehall, you'd wonder. Spades, Shovels, Pioneers they got, Guns, Swords, sav'd all since Oates's Plot, At Bilboa made, if I am not mistaken. Bridles and Saddles not a few, With Harnesses for Mankind too, To shew the French what they must do, if taken. The forty thousand Bills from Spain, Which ne'er till then saw Sun or Rain, But have in Hugger Mugger lain, fourteen year; The Pilgrims too, fly Voluntiers, Expected just so many years, If you'll believe't, t'increase French Fears, were seen there: But above all they were supplied With six Months powdred Beef beside, For fear the French should not provide enough, Sir. And armed with a pious Zeal For holy Kirk, and Commonweal, And Courage true as any Steel, or Buff, Sir. This grand Design was deeply laid, If it be true that People said, That Rochel was to be betray'd, or Dunkirk; Tho others said they were to go In dusk of Night to St. Malo, To burn the Ships and mall the Foe with Dungfork. But some a wiser thing did say, 'Twas farther off into a Bay, Not far from Bayonne, call'd Biscay nigh Spaniard. To stop our Search an Order came, That none the destin'd Place should name, But he should strait be hang'd for th'same at Main-yard. All thus equipt, Wind sitting Right, They hoisted Sail with all their Might, And safely past the Isle of Wight as can be. Strange Hopes and Fears did us possess, To know what would be the Success, When suddenly came an Express to Danby; Which brought Advice that Russel, he With L?ster's Duke could not agree; So was our Project utterly defeated. To get in order this Descent Four hundred thousand Pounds were spent; So you, and not the Government were cheated. Thus between French that us do beat, And Dutch that daily do us cheat, Our Grief and Ruins must be great, I fear it. Issachar's Arms may ours be made, An Ass between two Burdens laid, To both for being Jews betray'd you'll swear it. Namur we saw to France submit, At Steinkirk flush'd into a Net, And the Descent proved beshit all over. His Conquests thus at once you view, And how he did his Foes subdue; His Triumphs next I will to you discover. But first observe how he return'd! Some Paltry Ships that you thought burn'd, And Bart, with whom to fight he scorn'd, no wonder, Met him: But Kings, whose Honour lies As his, be not to fight a Prize With Folks concern'd in Robberies and Plunder. So to escape a Bloody Bout, He did take down his Royal Clout, Or Flag, on which it did fall out, Gaff. Momus. Our King of Bees then did not fail, Altho he wears no Sting in's Tail, And without shifting Hive to sail safe Home to's. The Tower Guns were all prepar'd, And Fireworks on Lighters rear'd; But what came on 'em I ne'er heard a Verbum. In Windows most Folks set up Lights, Excepting saucy Jacobites, That had their Glazing broke to rights, to curb 'em. First came some Guards to clear the way; And next a Squire with Boots of Hay, And on a Nag most miserably Bejaded. Two Men came next, who cring'd and bow'd, And humbly did beseech the Crowd, To make a noise, and baul aloud as they did. Then came a Coach, in which there sate Four Lords, who went, as People prate, His Highness to congratulate and flatter. Next twenty Mob, the Chief o'th Town, In left Hand Club, in right Hand Stone, Those Windows which had Candles none to batter. Four Horses next a Chariot drew, In which of Dutch-men there sate two, Whose very Looks would make one spew as I did. At last the fierce Life-guards appear'd, Who at the Candles gap'd and star'd: And thus his Triumphs you have heard described. Now judg if he's so fit a Pin For th'wounded Hole that he is in; Or have we cause to chuse again or no, Sir; If we to Slavery are born; Yet 'tis a Case that's too forlorn, To serve them that our Servants scorn, I trow Sir. But after all it must be said, His Conquests were not quite so bad, But he those Triumphs merited, and more, Sir: For sure no Emperor of Rome, Nor British King was, I presume, With Farthing Candles lighted home before, Sir. A Satyr written when the K? went to Flanders, and left nine Lords Justices. The attribution of this poem is questionable. A thin ill-natur'd Ghost that haunts the King, Till him and us he does to Ruin bring, Impeach'd and pardon'd, impudently rides The Council, and the Parliament bestrides; Where some bought Members, like his Serving-Men, To all his Lies devoutly say Amen. This brazen'd Liar, this known cursed K? Is now the Man that Church and State must save. Room for the Pink of starch'd Civility, The Emptiness of Old Nobility: This Fop without distinction does apply His Bows and Smiles to all promiscuously; With an affected Careless waves his Wand, And tottering on, does neither go nor stand. So humbly proud, and so genteely dull, Too weak for Counsel, and too old for Trull; That to conclude with this bilk'd stately thing, He's a meer costly piece of Garnishing. A drowsy Wittal drawn down to the last, Dead before's time for having liv'd too fast, Lives now upon the Wit that's long since gone, Nothing but Bulk remains, the Soul is flown; The little Good that's sometimes of him said, Is because Men will speak well of the Dead; For when all's done, this honest worthy Man Has no Remorse for taking all he can. A Grave Eye, and an Overthinking Face Seem to distinguish him from all his Race; But Nature's proud, and scorning all Restraint, By sudden Starts shews there's a mortal Taint; Which to a good Observer makes it plain The Frenzy will e'er long return again: But after all, to do him right, 'tis said The best of all the Nine should be stark mad. A good Attorny spoil'd, when his ill Fate And ours did make him Secretar' of State; For if his part had been to give a Charge At Country Sessions where he might enlarge, He'as a rare Method to display a thing With mighty Sense, not worth the mentioning: But the fine gilded Bead is much too weak To bear the weight he's under, so must break. Next, Painter, draw a Jackanapes of State, A Monkey turn'd into a Magistrate, A sawcy Wight born up with Heat and Noise, Fit only for a Ring-leader of Boys; To untile Neighbours Houses, and to play Such uncouth Gambols on a Holy-day. Strange! that so young a Government should dote, So as to let a Whirlwind rule the Boat. Ungrateful Toad-stool, despicable thing! Thus to desert thy Master and thy King; He was thy Maker too, and from the Dust Rais'd thee, tho 'twas to all Mankind's Disgust. William with all his Courage must be afraid To trust the Villain who has James betray'd; For sure no thing can e'er redeem thy Crime, But the same brutal Trick a second time. As rich in Words as he is poor in Sense, An empty piece of misplac'd Eloquence: With a soft Voice and a Moss Trooper's Smile, The Widgeon fain the Commons would beguile; But he is known, and 'tis hard to express How they deride his Northern Gentleness, While he lets loose the dull insipid Stream Of his set Speeches made up of whipt Cream. 'Tis here alone you'l find, where'er you seek, A profound Statesman with a cherry Cheek: He has a quick Eye and a sprightly Glance, His Face a Map of jolly Ignorance; The Lilies and the Roses so dispos'd, Should not by Care or Thought be discompos'd: Pity that fat, round, pretty, blushing thing Should e'er be thus condemn'd to Counselling. A Prophecy which hath been in a Manuscript in the Lord Powis's Family above sixty Years. About shall be 1647. Joined unto two times Three, And four times Ten with four times Two, 1648. Amongst us shall be great ado; An Eagle's Head that time shall fall, Scatter'd will be the young ones all. Then shall a Cypher swell so great, O.C. His Name 100 takes the Seat, And shall do mighty things before He is removed off the Shore; But ten times Four, with three times Six, 1658. Doth in another World him fix. Then quickly after you shall spy The Eagle back again to fly, And shall himself bedeck again With Feathers of his Father's Train; Then heavy Times shall make Men say Oft-times, Alas and Well-a-day, And wish that they a Death might find, For something troubles sore their Mind. Then after all a Cloud shall come, And almost darken quite the Sun; And in that time Actions shall be Chiefly carried on by Three: The Cross, the Surplice, and the Crown, Strive who shall put each other down; Great Treachery and Blood-shed then Shall sweep away great Store of Men. The Lion and blew Flower shall seek Quite to destroy the Heretick Sheep, And England shall be hard bested Before the Miter hence be rid. False Ireland continues our Woe, But zealous Scotland doth not so. Begin again at One and Six, Pop. Plot broke out, 1677. And ten times Seven begins these Tricks; And for a time shall last full sore, Till you may number One and Four. 1682. And for Four more it shall abate To return in a happy State. Then better every day will be, But no more—in England see. When 8 times eight and four times Three With Six and two shall joined be, 1684. Then shall be sacrificed C. In Dust shall lie that errant Whore, Disdain'd of all like to J? S? And all her Brats turn'd out of door. J. R. shall into Saddle slide, And furiously to Rome shall ride, His Principles no longer hide. The Pope shall have a fatal Fall And never trouble more Whitehall, Nor England's People more inthral. And he that chanceth to survive Until the Year of Eighty five, Shall see this Land begin to thrive. O England's Wonder, which hath never been, Three Queens in England shortly shall be seen. Two Dukes shall highly for the Crown contend, Each shall bring England's Monarchy to end. B? shall fall into Contempt and Scorn, And Gospel-Angels shall our Church adorn. If any ask how this shall come to pass, The Fox shall ride the Goose, the Goose the Ass. An Epitaph upon the E. of Ro?ster's being dismist from the Treasury in 1687, by Mr. Dryden. Here lies a Creature of indulgent Fate, From Tory H??de rais'd to a Chit of State; In Chariot now Elisha like he's hurl'd To th'upper empty Regions of the World; The Airy thing cuts thro the yielding Sky, And as it goes does into Atoms fly: While we on Earth see, with no small Delight, The Bird of Prey turn'd to a Paper-Kite. With drunken Pride and Rage he did so swell, The hated thing without Compassion fell; By powerful Force of universal Prayer, The ill-blown Bubble is now turn'd to Air; To his first less than Nothing he is gone, By his preposterous Transaction. King James to himself, by Mr. D?n. Unhappy I, who once ordain'd did bear God's Justice Sword, and his Vicegerent here, Am now depos'd, 'gainst me my Children rise, My Life must be their only Sacrifice. Highly they me accuse, but nothing prove, But this is out of Tenderness and Love: They seek to spill my Blood, 'tis that alone Must for the Nation's crying Sins atone. But careful Heaven forewarn'd me in a Dream, And shew'd me that my Dangers were extreme; The Heavenly Vision spoke and bid me flee, Th'ungrateful Wretches were not worthy me. Alarm'd I fled at the appointed time, Thus meer Necessity was made my Crime. On the Duke of Bucks, by Mr. Dr?n. 1 I sing the Praise of a worthy Knight, Whose King James (that never could fight) For his but more for his A? made a Knight. 2 This Knight soon after a Duke became, And got at the Island of Rhee such Fame, That since all English men curse his Name. 3 This Idol Duke to that Greatness did swell, That Honours and Riches before him fell, Till Felton the Brave sent his Soul to Hell. 4 And now you shall hear how his mighty Son With the very small Sin of Incest begun, And to Treason and B?ry went on. 5 For first, old Richmond can tell when and where, For the Treasons the Papers of old Oliver, And Keniston's A? knows the B?r. 6 Now he who nobly and bravely begins, Must afterwards know when such Glory he wins; Adultery and Murder are but trivial Sins. 7 I come to his Farce, which must needs be well done, For Troy was not longer before it was won, Since 'tis more than ten Years since this Farce was begun. 8 With Help of Pimps, Plays, and Table Chat, And the Advice of his own Canonical Sprat, And his Family Scribe, Antichristian Mat. 9 With transcribing of these, and transversing those, With transmitting of Rhyme, and transversing Prose, He hath drest up his Farce with other Mens Clothes. 10 His abusing the Living and robbing the Dead, His inserting fine things which other Men said, Makes this new way of writing without Tail or Head. 11 But where the Devil his own Wit doth lie, They must have very good Eyes that espy, Unless in the Dances and Mimiquery. 12 I confess the Dances are very well writ, And the Time and the Tune by Hains are well set, And Littleton's Motion and Dress has much Wit. 13 But when his Poet John Bays did appear, 'Twas known to more than half that were there, That the greatest part was his Grace's Character. 14 For he many Years plagu'd his Friends for their Crimes, Repeating his Verses in other Mens Rhymes, To the very same Person ten thousand times. 15 But his Grace has tormented the Players more Than the Howards or Flocknoes, or all the Store Of damned dull Rogues that e'er plagu'd them before. 16 When in France and in Spain, and in Holland, 'tis known What Wonders our mighty Statesman has done, 'Twill make them all tremble to hear his Renown. 17 For he that can libel the Poets, and knows How to mimick the Players in Gestures and Clothes, With ease may destroy all his Majesty's Foes. 18 Now the Church he contemns as much as a Quaker, The Kingdom he'l ruin if the Parliament forsake her, For he serves his King as bad as his Maker. 19 For he that forsook him in all his Distress, Kill'd the Husband, and kept the Adulteress, Like Judah would sell him, and sell him for less. 20 He hath mimick'd the King and Duke o'er and o'er, That merciful King that hath pardoned more Than all our Kings e'er pardon'd before; 21 That King that if e'er he committed a Crime, That to Church and to State may prove fatal in time, It was in extending his Mercy to him. 22 Now God grant his Majesty never may find, What's fatal, to be to a Buckingham kind, For his Father was ruin'd by the first of the Line. Prologue for Sir John Falstaff, rising slowly to soft Musick. See Britains, see one half before your Eyes Of the old Falstaff labouring to arise. Curse on these straitlac'd Traps and French Machines, None but a Genius can ascend these Scenes. Once more my English Air I breath agen, And smooth my double Ruff, and double Chin. Now let me see what Beauties gild the Sphere; Body O me! the Ladies still are fair: The Boxes shine, and Gallerys are full, Such were our Bona Robas at the Bull. But Supreme Jove, what washy Rogues are here? Are these the Sons of Beef and English Beer? Old Pharaoh never dreamt of Kine so lean, This comes of meagre Soop and sour Champaign. Degenerate Race! Let your old Sire advise, If you desire to fill the fair Ones Eyes, Drink unctious Stck, and emulate my Size. Your half-flown Strains aspire to humble Bliss, And proudly aim no lower than a Kiss, Till quite worn out with acting Beaux and Wits, You're all sent crawling to the Gravel-Pits: Pretending Claps, there languishing you lie, And let the Maids of the Green-sickness die. The Case was other when we rul'd the Roast, We rob'd and ravish'd, but you sigh and toast. But here I see a Side-box better lin'd, Where old plump Jack in Miniature I find, Tho they're but Turnspits of the Mastiff kind. Half bred they seem, mark'd with the Mungrels Curse, Oons! which among you dares attempt a Purse? If you'd appear my Sons, defend my Cause, And let my Wit and Humour find applause; Shew your Disdain those nauseous Scenes to taste, Where French Buffoon like leanest Switzer drest, Turns all good Politicks to Farce and Jest. Banish such Apes, and save the sinking Stage; Let Mimes and squeaking Eunuchs fill your Rage; On such let your descending Curse be try'd, Preserve plump Jack, and banish all beside. To the Lords assembled in Council; The Petition of Tho. Brown. Humbly Sheweth, Should you order Tom Brown To be Whipt thro the Town For Scurvy Lampoon, Tate, Southern, and Crown, Their Pens will lay down. E'en Durfy himself, and such merry Fellows, That put their whole trust in Tunes and Trangdillos, May hang up themselves, and their Harps on the Willows. For if Poets are punish'd for Libelling Trash, Jo. Dryden, at sixty, may yet fear the Lash. No Pension nor Praise, All Birch and no Bays; These are not right ways Our Fancies to raise To the writing of Plays, And Prologues so witty, That jerk at the City; And now and then hit Some Friend in the Pit, So hard, and so pat, Till he hides with his Hat His monstrous Crevat. The Pulpits alone Can never preach down The Fops of the Town: Then pardon Tom Brown, And let him write on. But if you had rather convert the poor Sinner, His foul railing Mouth may be stopt with a Dinner, Give him Clothes to his back, some Meat and much Drink, Then clap him close Prisoner without Pen and Ink. And your Petitioner shall ever pray, &amp;c. To Mr. Dryden, upon his declaring himself a Roman Catholick. Great Truckling Soul! whose stubborn Honesty Does with all Revolutions still comply. Thy Youthful Muse gilt an Usurper's Bays, And for King-killing smoothly sang his Praise; Nay, valiantly and wisely fawn'd on's Herse, And strove 't embalm his Name in Loyal Verse. And then Reformers were not call'd prick-ear'd, But plain Religion Primitive appear'd, Because, like its first Master, all its Charms Were Truth and Peace, not jugling Shews nor Arms. When Heav'n was pleas'd our Princes to restore, Thou with the first didst servilely adore Those Earthly Gods thou hadst Blasphem'd before. In High Weak Verse then fulsomely didst load With Titles due only to th'Heavenly God, By thee as much unknown, as are his Ways untrod. The Mitre, which meer Priest-Craft, and Priest-Pride With Gordian Knots have to the Crown fast ty'd, As if one Empire could not stand by Law, But by another within to keep't in Aw, Receiv'd thy Homage too, and then our Creed Seem'd only some weak Christian's feeble Reed; And true Religion, which must save Mankind, T'Indifferent necessary Rites confin'd. So like thou thought'st thine and the Churches Scene, That Poet Squab would fain have been a Dean: But thy lewd Life, and publick Blasphemys Made a Loose Clergy such gross Vice despise. Being thus deny'd the Loaves, thou didst decry The Miracles as a meer Forgery. No Sect nor Clergy could secure their Fame, All Priests and all Religions were the same. E'en Holy Church was lug'd into thy Farce, And Ghostly Fry'r made Pimp to Bully's Tarse; A meer Almanzor grewst in e'ery Sin, In Atheism didst outvie thy Maximin; Lampoon'st our God, thy Patrons, e'en the Great And Sacred David's self, who gave thee Meat. No Vice which thy lewd Thought and Poverty Could reach, but was us'd, and disgrac'd by thee. Thus by bad Men deipis'd, abhor'd by Good, Thou bungled'st out a Life like a loath'd Toad, Impatiently then waiting a new Wind Of Doctrine fit for thy licentious Mind, Till a curst Western blast of Popery came; Pop'ry, of Christendom the Plague and Shame, The Yoke of Princes, the true Politick Cheat, To cramp the Honest, and to make Knaves Great. Thou suckd'st th'Infection in the very Nick, And pliant Conscience veer'd to Catholick; Thy Zeal e'en nimble Harry Hills outran, And Turn-coat Nich. Butler the Publican. Should Mahomet this Antichrist o'erthrow, Thy Crucifix would to the Crescent bow. At thy Conversion, Jack, thus Whigs rejoice, Who see not through the Prudence of thy Choice. What so fit refuge for thee as New Rome, Which, like the Old, receives all Nations Scum? Or what so fit retirement couldst thou choose For an old Bawdy, Prophane, Thieving Muse, When all her Stock of purloin'd Wit was gone, As making the dry fumbling Jade a Nun? Now she may translate Legends for our Land, According to his Majesty's Command; And drivel out her dregs of Poetry In Hymns on all the Sacred Trumpery Of Reverend Relicks, pretty Miracles, Which the Monk forges, then devoutly sells: How Mary's Image weeps for sinning Souls, Though with dry Eyes she bore the Carvers Tools, When through her Trunk he drill'd the Squirting holes: How the Milk which from her Paps did distil, Is grown a Flood enough to drive a Mill; How the curst Cross, at first but one man's Weight, Is now encreased to a Navy's Freight, (And 'tis but fit they multiply the Wood, Who so oft make and crucify the God.) Such lofty Themes I leave thee to pursue; So Jack of all Faiths, and of none, Adieu. Upon Mr. Neal's projecting new Taxes. In vain the harass'd People strive To keep their gasping Trade alive, If Bankrupt Neal, whom all Stars curse, Has the disposal of their Purse; He Ante manum will advance Our future Rents for present Chance, And leave our Children like his own To gnaw upon a Naked Bone, And we our selves this Year shall be Turn'd to a Million Lottery, Where for two Thousand that get Plums Ninety eight thousand suck their Thumbs. Then rouze your selves, ye Men of Lands, Of English Hearts and unbrib'd Hands, And rescue us from being Slaves To Home-bred Fools or Foreign Knaves; And if abroad we must be kickt, Yet let us not at home be nickt. Doctor Hannes Dissected, in a Familiar Epistle, by way of Nosce Teipsum. Some say a Physician of late That always lov'd to serve the Great, Met a Disease outmatch'd his Skill, And some pretend to say so still: Tho learnedly he'as told the Mob, The Lungs were tainted ev'ry Lobe, And how th'Abdomen was affected, So nicely well it was dissected. As who should say, that Dr. Hannes, If any one would take the Pains, Wanted either Lungs or Brains. I know not what the Vulgar think, Or how some Men at Noon-day wink; But thus it is, may't please you all, To raise a P?mp a Prince must fall. Thus when grave Sages are neglected, And beardless Boys so much respected; When Oracles, that us'd of old Mighty Mysteries to unfold, Are like Stories still untold: When solid Truth and solid Gold, Are for Noise and Gingle sold; Then Notion may for Knowledg pass, But Æsculapius for an Ass. Thistles and Logick chop together, As Baro?men do Wind and Weather; Both hit alike, and both prove good, One for the Mind, the other Food. Had not Mens Wits eclipsed been, 'Tis Ten to one we had foreseen, And then we'd needed no Dissections, No Consultations, no Inspections, Nor any need of these Reflections; But when mens Eyes are grown so bad, They canot see what once they had, 'Tis time to let 'em feel the smart, And clear their Eyes by rules of Art. When that falls short, 'tis some content, Tho the Mark was miss'd it was well meant. And thus poor Mortals seek for Ease, When the Physician's the Disease; As Learned Heathens use to tell, Where such Men live does Sorrow dwell. But sure a Nation must be blind, Or else they wear their Eyes behind, That cannot tell a Man of Sense, From one that's all Impertinence, All Guts and Meseraick Veins, Lungs, Liver, Spleen and rotten Reins, But little Head, and much less Brains; Joints stiff, Inflexible as Stones, No Juice or Marrow in his Bones, Nor Flesh nor Fat is to be seen, But Muscles shrivled, dry and lean. This is the Wondrous piece of Nature, That picks the Bones of every Creature: And yet you'd swear, to look upon him, He knows no more than what comes from him, But how so great a Man of Art, Should let a Royal Heir depart, And never tell the reason why, He shou'd not live, or he shou'd die. Tho some time after, as they say, He cou'd have told a certain Way, How to have got the Poison out, That lurk'd in th'Heart or thereabout. But then his Thoughts were so perplext, Just as a Priest that takes a Text, And has forgot what he design'd When first the Text was in his mind: Ev'n so our learn'd Apollo did, Not thinking what Heaven had forbid. But had the People thought on't then, They might have been great Friends to Spain, And sav'd them many a needless Shilling, That they bestow'd on their King's Killing, By sending for a Neapolitan, When we have much a quicker Man, And far more dextrous at the Parts, At shewing livid Lungs or Hearts, Or any Secret of that Nature, For this is but the smallest matter; He can in few years practice show, How he has serv'd a thousand so. And wou'd you wonder at his Skill, Whose Business 'tis he shows to Kill; Spaniards, dull Souls, preserv'd their King, By Chocolate or some such thing: When Hannes has Arts, as yet unknown, Where 'tis but Presto, and they're gone. I wonder any one then dare With this Philosopher compare; Gibbons and Ratclife, he'd prove Fools, If laid in's Anatomick Schools. He'd so dissect both their Abdomens, You'd swear they were but nasty Omens: Then tell you 'tis but common Matter, Such as is found in every Creature, As wise in Brutes as human Nature. For my part, I believe it true, Since, Hannes, I see no more in you. A Poem on the Death of his Highness the Duke of Gloucester. With the sad Tydings of the Day opprest, I laid me down to seek Relief from Rest; When lo! Britannia's Genius wrapt in Night, But op'ning wide the Intellectual Sight, Before me stood, and with a dismal Mien Renew'd my Grief and gave me back to Spleen: His weighty Sorrows I cou'd well divine, Sprung from the same too cruel Cause with mine. Old England's Weal was his peculiar Care, And mine the fatal Loss of England's Heir. But having now the opportunity To know the secret Counsels of the Sky, Led on by Princely Love and Loyal Fear, Thus to the Genius I addrest my Prayer. Great Guardian Angel of this happy Isle, On which till now the Gods did ever smile, Instruct me in the Mystery of Fate, That thus perplexes and disjoints the State. Since all the Kingly Race our Annals shew Have had a Royal Issue still in view, How comes it now (by a severe Decree) That Blessing's wanting for Posterity? Long on the Throne may Glorious William shine; But Gloucester's gone!—the Promise of the Line! I spoke, and thus the Gracious Form reply'd: From you I'll not the Gods Intentions hide. Things Sacred heretofore, are now profan'd; Monarchs of old for publick Good ordain'd, In lawless Rage and Lust of Pow'r have reign'd. Lewis contemns Divine and Human Laws, And on himself his Peoples Curses draws; Nulls his own Compacts, and with raging Might, By wilful Sway invades the Subjects Right: Tyrant o'er Souls! he would usurp the Throne Of Conscience, sacred to the Gods alone; While by his impious Rage expell'd from home, Distrest, from Pole to Pole his Vassals roam. The strong Contagion of this Gallick Pest Invades the Northern Air; and Denmark, blest With King-restraining Rights of antient Date, Shares with her Sister France an equal Fate. From hence Great Ericson attempts in vain The Liberties of Sweden to maintain: And James, by the same ill Example led, Thro furious Zeal his Kingdoms forfeited. Cease then to wonder that a pious Prince, The Darling, and the Care of Providence, Just lent us for the Vision of a Day, From wide Infection should be snatcht away! The Weight of Empire, and the Cares of State Should not depend upon a single Fate. For tho in Antient Story we may find, How some few Neighbouring Families combin'd To chuse a Chief, by whose Paternal Care They might be govern'd both in Peace and War; Yet since the Scene is alter'd, and of late Whole Nations join'd make but one common State, What finite Person can sustain the Load, Alone sufficient for the Common Good? Thus when the scatter'd Swains of Alban Race, For publick Safety sought the Sacred Place Which the Twin-Brothers piously design'd The Seat of Empire (should the Gods be kind); One Chief was thought sufficient to command Their new-born Empire, and small Tract of Land: But when th'Auspicious Arms of rising Rome Inlarg'd her Sway to Regions far from Home, Her Discipline soon alter'd with her Fate; Her Lords grew many, as her Empire great. And since the Gods with Pleasure have survey'd Albion's Increase in People, Pow'r and Trade; And that Ierne's rich and fruitful Soil Pays yearly Tribute to our British Isle; That she extends her propagated Sway, And either Indies her Commands obey; Since none but Mighty William's awful Hand The Reins of Power so justly can command, No more lament your Prince's early Fate, To Heav'nly Glory took from Earthly State; He loses Life, but is of that secure That louder sounds and longer will endure, A faultless Name! when more the Fates deny, The second Lot is happily to die. Then happy He! who from the Task retires Which all that Nassau can perform, requires. And as the Attick Realm of old decreed No Prince the Godlike Codrus should succeed; Striving to build, by that new way to Fame, Their last and best of Kings a Deathless Name; So may the grateful Tribes of Britain's Race This Handle, offer'd by the Gods, embrace; And by their last Effort of Loyalty, Th'Athenians Honour to their King decree. A Description of Mr. Dryden's Funeral. Of Kings Renown'd and Mighty Bards I write, Some kill'd by Whores, and others slain in Fight; Some starving liv'd, whilst others were prefer'd; But all, when dead, are in one place inter'd. A Fabrick stands by Antient Heroes built, Design'd for Holy Use t'atone their Guilt; Here Sacred Urns of Majesty they keep, Here Kings and Poets most profoundly sleep; Here Choristers in Hymns their Voices raise, And charm the dreadful Goblins from the Place. Tho throng'd with Tombs, no Specter here is found, They sing the very Devil off the ground: No Night-mare dances 'mongst the antient Tombs, Nor sulphurous Incubus dispenses Fumes; Nor let no subterranean Hag affright My Muse, whilst of the FUNERAL I write. A Bard there was, who whilome did command, And held the Laurel in his potent Hand; He o'er Parnassus bore Imperial Sway, Him all the little Tribes of Bards obey: But Bards and Kings, howe'er approv'd and great, Must stoop at last to the Decrees of Fate. Fate bid him for the Stroke of Death prepare, And then remov'd him to the Lord knows where. If to the Living we such Tributes owe, We on the Dead must pious Rites bestow; To our Assistance all the Wits must call, To grace the Glory of the Funeral. Who is the first appears unto our View, But haughty, proud, imperious M?ue? Who cocks his Chin, and scarce affords a Word, But looks as big as any Belgick Lord; In the best Dairies fed, grown sleek and fat, The creeping Mouse is turn'd into a Rat: Of others Brows he licks the toilsom Sweat, And by our Sins grows impudently great: As chief of Wits he does himself prefer, And with our Gold bribes ev'ry Flatterer; But Men of Sense and Honour does despise, And crushes such as would by Virtue rise, Whilst each leud Rakehel of the nauseous Town He fills with Coin, and does with Honours crown. The Nation's Wealth he most profusely spends, But not on such as are the Nation's Friends; But such as wrote our Country to inslave, His Kindness follows even to the Grave. He the great Bard at his own Charge inters, And dying Vice to living Worth prefers. Some others too in the Affair are join'd, Alike in Morals, and alike in Mind; But these my Muse must here forbear to name, Scarce worthy Honour or deserving Fame. The Day is come, and all the Wits must meet From Covent-Garden down to Watling-street; They all repair to the Physicians Dome, There lies the Corps, and there the Eagles come: No Corps an Entrance has within this Gate, None are admitted here to lie in State, But such as Fate a noted Death has carv'd, A Cutpurse hang'd, or a poor Poet starv'd; One is anatomiz'd when he is dead, The other in his Life for want of Bread. A Troop of Stationers at first appear'd, And Jacob T?n Captain of the Guard; Jacob the Muses Midwife, who well knows To ease a lab'ring Muse of Pangs and Throws; He oft has kept the Infant-Poet warm, Oft lick'd th'unweildy Monster into Form; Oft do they in high Flights and Raptures swell, Drunk with the Waters of our Jacob's Well. Next these the Playhouse Sparks do take their turn, With such as under Mercury are born, As Poets, Fidlers, Cut-purses, and Whores, Drabs of the Play-house, and of Common-shores; Pimps, Panders, Bullies, and Eternal Beaux, Fam'd for short Wits, long Wigs, and gaudy Clothes; All Sons of Meter tune the Voice in praise, From lofty Strains, to humble Ekes and Ayes: The Singing-men and Clerks who charm the Soul, And all the Traders in fa la fa sol: All these the Funeral Obsequies do aid, As younger Brothers of the Rhyming Trade. The tuneful Rabble now together come, They fill with dolesome Sighs the sable Room Some groan'd, some sob'd, and some I think there wept, And some got drunk, loll'd down, and snor'd and slept. Around the Corps in State they wildly press; In Notes unequal, like Pindarick Verse, Each one does his sad Sentiments express. The Player says, My Friends we are undone, See here, the Muses best and darling Son Is from us to the blest Elyzium gone: What other Poet for us will engage To be the Prop of the declining Stage? All other Poets are not worth a Louse, There fell the Prop of our once glorious House: But now from us by Fate untimely torn, Leaves the dull Stage a Desert and forlorn. A dismal Sadness in each Face appears; And such as could not speak, burst out in Tears; His Death, alas! affected ev'ry body, And fetch'd deep Sighs and Tears from ev'ry Noddy: It much affected every tuneful Ringer, But most of all the jolly Ballad-singer, Who now at a Street's Corner must no more A Play-house Song in equal Numbers roar. Nay, I am told, when he his last Gasp groan'd, The Bell-rope trembled, and the Organ ton'd: And as great things affect a little thing, This was the Death of many a Fiddle-string. No Chronicles I read of do relate Such a sad Hurricane in Church and State. The charming Songsters at our great St. Paul's Cou'd scarce sing Pray'rs to save their very Souls; The Boys were dumb, the Singingmen were wounded, All the whole Choir disabled and confounded: And when the Prayers were ended, alas then The Clerk could hardly sob out an Amen. Not a Crowdero at a Bawdy-house, Who us'd in racy Liquors to carouse, But with sad haste unto the Burial ran, Forgets his Tipple, and neglects his Can. With Tag-rag, Bob-tail was the Room full fill'd, You'd think another Babel to be built; Not more Confusion at St. Bat's fam'd Fair, Or at Guildhall for choice of a Lord Mayor. But stay my Muse, the learned G?th appears, He sighing comes, and is half drown'd in Tears; The famous G?th, whom learned Poets call Knight of the Order of the Urinal. He of Apollo learnt his wondrous Skill, He taught him how to sing and how to kill; For all he sends unto the darksome Grave, He honours also with an Epitaph. He entertain'd the Audience with Oration, Tho very new, yet something out of fashion: But 'cause the Hearers were with Learning blest, He said it in the Language of the Beast: But so pronounc'd, the Sound and Sense agrees, A Country-mouse talks better in a Cheese, Or Jack-at-a-pinch, when reeling he repairs To neighb'ring Church to mumble o'er his Prayers. The Sense and Wit they say was very good, Tho neither seen, felt, heard, nor understood. Thus we must all, as common Rumour saith, Believe the Doctor by implicit Faith. Next him the Sons of Musick pass along, And murder Horace in confounded Song; Whose Monument more durable than Brass, Is now defac'd by every chanting Ass. No Man at Tyburn doom'd to take a swinging, Would stay to hear such miserable singing, Where all the Beasts of Musick try their Throats, And different Species use their different Notes: Here the Ox bellows, there the Satyr howls; The Puppies whine, and the bold Mastiff growls; The Magpys chatter, and the Night-Owls screek; The old Pigs grunt, and all the young ones squeek: Yet all together make melodious Songs, As Bumpkin Trols to rusty pair of Tongs. Now, now the time is come, the Parson says, And for their Exeunt to the Grave he prays: The Way is long, and Folk the Streets are clogging, Therefore my Friends away, come let's be jogging. Assist me Thou, who, clad in Sun-beam Weeds, Driv'st round the Orb each day with fiery Steeds; Who neither art with Heat nor Cold opprest, Art never weary, tho thou tak'st no rest: Assist me to describe the Cavalcade, What mighty Figure thro the Streets they made. Before the Herse the mourning Hautboys go, And screech a dismal sound of Grief and Wo; More dismal Notes from Bogtrotters may fall, More dismal Plaints at Irish Funeral. But no such Flood of Tears e'er stopt our Tide Since Charles the Martyr and the Monarch dy'd. The Decency and Order first describe, Without regard to either Sex or Tribe. The sable Coaches lead the dismal Van, But by their sides I think few Footmen ran: Nor needed these, the Rable fill the Streets, And Mob with Mob in great Disorder meets. See next the Coaches how they are accouter'd Both in the Inside, eke and on the Outward: One pocky Spark, one sound as any Roach, One Poet and two Fidlers in a Coach; The Play-house Drab, that beats the Beggars Bush, And Bawdy talks would make an old Whore blush, By every Bully kiss'd, good Truth, but such is Now her good Fate to ride with Mrs. Dutchess. Was e'er Immortal Poet thus buffoon'd? In a long Line of Coaches thus lampoon'd? A Man with Gout and Stone quite wearied, Would rather live than thus be buried. What greater Plague can Heaven on Man bestow, Who must with Knaves on Life's dull Journy go? And when on t'other Shoar he's landed safe, A Crowd of Fools attend him to the Grave, A Crowd so nauseous, so profusely leud, With all the Vices of the Times endu'd, That Cowley's Marble wept to see the Throng, Old Chaucer laugh'd at their unpolish'd Song, And Spencer thought he once again had seen The Imps attending on his Fairy Queen. Her little Tib, and Tom, and Mib, and Mab, Come to lament the Death of Poet Squab. But Burying is not all the Rites we owe, Some other Obsequies we must bestow: Must so Religious, so profound a Wit, Be toss'd like common Dust into the Pit? The Fates forbid! We'll surely fill the Plains And neighb'ring Woods with Elegiack Strains: E'en Newgate's Chaplain, who in's Office fell, Instructing Villains in the way to Hell; He had the Muses Pass-port on his Herse, His Praises sung in everlasting Verse. Nay, a Dutch Mastiff late in state did lie; My Lady's Lap-dog had an Elegy; And shall not Dryden have one O Fy, Fy! Yes, say the Oxford and the Cambridg Sparks, We'll sing his Death as sweet as any Larks; Oxford and Cambridg, the renowned Schools, Fam'd for a Breed of wise Men and of Fools, Where Infant Wits with Water-gruel fed, And little puny sucking Priests are bred; Where Conjurers employ their Time in Vision, Whence many a Learned Saffold has his Mission? These always march in Verse in rank and file, In Company pursue Poetick Toil; Here a Battalion does in English lead, While one in Latin does the Troopers head: But such the Wit and Sense, you'd think the Elves Did only write but just to please themselves: Playford laments that he their Lines bespoke, And swears the Bookseller is almost broke. A Melancholy Theme on a dismal Disaster, In a Grubstreet Poem, by Grubstreet Poetaster. Quos Deus vult perdere, bos dementat. Whom Jove reserves to Fate, he doth infatuate. Mundus vult decipi; Qui enim vult decipi decipiatur. The World will be deceiv'd, because they love it, Why should they not, when 'tis Deceit they covet? Three Doctors of late Held a learned Debate On a desperate Case of a Lamb o' the State; Where each shot his Bolt, And on the Result Did declare they opin'd the Distemper occult. Tho my Story be late, And thought out of date, We cannot too often great Actions repeat. Beau H?s fresh from School, A new sharpen'd Tool, Was summoned first to be on the Roll. H?s active and great, Ad omne parate, Had ???? ?????? the Dispensing of Fate. So he led the Dance, A la mode of France, And (without ever thinking) directed the Lance: But hand over head, Did attempt and proceed (At all peradventure) this Lamb for to bleed. By which sage Advice He was bled in a trice, To shew the Dispatch of an expert Novice. Now the Deed being done, The grim Fact to atone, Our great Æsculape did fall in a Swoon. Who by sympathick Touch, Having acted too much, Was strangely affected, his Sense it was such. And being put to Bed, As one almost dead, Did order himself forthwith to be bled. Which shew'd he would do As he'd be done unto, To bleed, as he bled, whether needed or no. As Erostrate's great Name Is still living in Fame, Who did put the Temple-Diana in Flame. H?s only desir'd (By Ambition fir'd) To gain some Repute before he expir'd. Next G?bb?s tho muddy, And always in Study, His Thoughts being quicken'd with a thing that is ruddy, Did stir up his Muse To Action and Use, And approv'd all H?s had done at fast and loose: Yet added his Mite, By Directions to write, Did Clysters and Cupping and Cordials endite. But acting too fast, Growing qualmish at last, He was forc'd to retire for needful Repast. So R?t?ff was next, And (tho formerly vext) Was persuaded his Science to spend on the Text; Having Wine first to drink, It whet him to think, Especially being well sweetned with Chink. But the Fever malignant Did puzzle Skill pregnant, 'Twas-so very putrid and super-regnant: That off o' the Hooks, You might guess by their Looks, They found nought cou'd prevail that was in their Books. So these Magi's next part Boldly was to assert, That (since he must die) 'twas according to Art. But now to find out And bring it about, The Mob to persuade and the Plebeian Rout; He must be dissected, And with care inspected, To report all Parts were with Matter infected. And avouch no Mistake Such Learning cou'd make, Three famous Epistles for these Doctors sake, Must be publish'd in Print, Up and down to be sent, Composed of Words, without Argument. That he died of a Rash With eating of Trash, Which is a sufficient Account for your Cash. But such frail Excuse Is of no force or use, (The Mischief once done) Folk to disabuse. If the Counsel were good In such case to let Blood; What needed feign'd Words, ne'er before understood? For Rash is a Name No Author does claim, But is true modern Cant to cover a Shame. By common Instinct, Almost all Men do think, The stirring this matter has made it to stink. And Silence were better, Than from each a Letter, To make an O yes to smother the matter. To do Penance in Sheet, In some cases is meet, And by Civil Law still esteemed discreet. But why our Physicians On different Conditions, In a Sheet should appear to take off Suspicions, No Man can divine, But their Thoughts do incline To believe it was Ignorance, Madness or Wine. Some to get a Name, Do publish their Shame, And by vain Excuses their Errors proclaim. Qui ante non cavet, post dolebit. Felix quem faciunt aliena Pericula cautum. Whoso improves not his Spring, may be forc'd to repent it in Autumn. Men hold that Man in high Veneration, Whose Name is rais'd up by a just Reputation. Whose Name is proclaim'd without Desert or Honor, Not Fame, but Infame, is the Author and Donor. A Comparison betwixt Lewis XIV. and Prince Eugene. Now Lewis, all thy numerous Trophies boast, Recount the Blood and Treasure they have cost, Tell of Towns storm'd, and Countries over-run, And all by thy victorious Armies won. O had but Fate, indulgent to thy Fame, When Europe trembled at thy mighty Name, Compell'd thee hence— In all her List she never could have shewn A happier Hero, or more darling Son. Yet now thy Brows not only wrinkled show, But Age has made their Laurels wither too. Thus Hannibal, his many Conquests past, Found Fabius to grapple with at last; Fabius more great, with wiser Conduct blest, Vanquish'd the Victor, and his Pride represt: Sure means he found to make the Tyrians yield, And by declining Battel won the Field. An Epitaph on the Late King of Spain. Cy gist icy Charles Roy d' Espagne, Qui en ses jours ne sist Campagne, Ny Enfans Males, ny Femelles, Laissant ses deux Femmes pucelles. Qu' 'at il donc fait ce vaillant Prince, Qui possedoit tont de Provinces, A vous le dire Franchement, Rien, pas mesme son Testament. Here lies the last King Charles of Spain, Who all his Life ne'er made Campagn; He made no Children, Girl nor Boy, Nor gave two Wives one nuptial Joy. What has this valiant Prince then done, Who long possess'd so vast a Throne? E'en nothing neither Good nor Ill, Nay not so much as made his Will. A Fable. In Æsop's Tales an honest Wretch we find, Whose Years and Comforts equally declin'd; He in two Wives had two domestick Ills, For different Age they had, and different Wills; One pluckt his black Hairs out, and one his grey, The Man for Quietness did both obey, Till all his Parish saw his Head quite bare, And thought he wanted Brains as well as Hair. The Moral. The Parties, hen-peckt W?m, are thy Wives, The Hairs they pluck are thy Prerogatives; Tories thy Person hate, the Whigs thy Power, Tho much thou yieldest, still they tug for more, Till this poor Man and thou alike are shown, He without Hair, and thou without a Crown. The Patriots. Writ about the Year 1700. 1 Ye Patriots go on To heal the Nation's Sores, Find all Mens Faults out but your own, Begin good Laws, but finish none, And then shut up your Doors. 2 Fail not our Freedom to secure, And all our Friends disband, And send those Men to t'other Shore Who were such Fools as to come o'er To help this grateful Land. 3 And may the next that hear us pray, And in Distress relieve us, Go home like those without their Pay, And with Contempt be sent away For having once believ'd us. 4 And if the French should e'er attempt This Nation to invade, May they be damn'd that list again, But lead the fam'd Militia on, To be like us betray'd. 5 As for the Crown you have bestow'd, With all its Limitations, The meanest Prince in Christendom Would never stir a Mile from home To govern three such Nations. 6 The King himself, whom you have call'd Your Saviour in Distress, You in his first Suit have deny'd, And then his Royal Patience try'd, With a canting sham Address. 7 Ye are the Men that to be chose Would be at no Expences, Who love no Friends, nor fear no Foes, Have ways and means that no Man knows To mortify your Senses. 8 Ye are the Men that can condemn By Laws made ex post facto, Who can make Knaves of honest Men, And married Women turn again To be Virgo and Intacta. 9 Go on to purify the Court, And damn the Men of Places, Till decently you send them home, And get your selves put in their room, And then you'l change your Faces. 10 Go on for to establish Trade, And mend our Navigation, Let India India invade, And borrow on Funds will ne'er be paid, And bankrupt all the Nation. 11 'Tis you that calculate our Gold, And with a senseless Tone Vote what you never understood, That we might take them if we wou'd, Or let them all alone. 12 Your Missives you send round about With Mr. Speaker's Letter, To fetch Folks in, and find Folks out, Which Fools believe without dispute, Because they know no better. 13 With borrow'd Ships, and hir'd Men The Irish to reduce, Who will be paid the Lord knows when; 'Tis hop'd when e'er you want again, You'l think of that Abuse. 14 Ye laid sham Taxes on our Malt, On Salt, on Glass, and Leather, To wheedle Coxcombs in to lend; And like true Cheats you dropt that Fund, And sunk them all together. 15 And now y'are piously enclin'd The Needy to employ, You'd better much your time bestow To pay neglected Debts you owe, Which makes them multiply. 16 Against Profaneness you declar'd, And then the Bill rejected; And when the Arguments appear'd, They were the worst that e'er were heard, And best that we expected. 17 'Twas voted once, that for the Sin Of Whoring Men should die all; But then 'twas wisely thought again, The House would quickly grow so thin, They durst not stand the Tryal. 18 King Charles the Second knew your aim, And Places gave and Pensions; And had King William's Money flown, His Majesty would soon have known Your Consciences Dimensions. 19 But he hath wisely given you up To work your own Desires, And laying Arguments aside, As things that have in vain been try'd, To Fasting calls and Prayers. Chorus. Your Hours are choicely employ'd, Your Petitions lie all on the Table, With Funds insufficient, And Taxes Deficient, And Deponents innumerable. For shame leave this wicked Employment, Reform both your Manners and Lives; Tou were never sent out To make such a Rout, Go home and look after your W?s. On Squire Neal's Projects. You M?ves, Cl?is, H?lys, F?y's, Lowthers, Who in the House are wont to make great Pothers, And squander Taxes time in long Debates, To save those foolish Trifles, our Estates, Be silent now; and for the publick Weal, Give ear to learned Barebone, prudent Neal, Those Oracles rais'd by relenting Fate, Both to direct and prop the puzled State: As once the hungry Geese in Capitol, Sav'd Rome from the same direful Foe, the Gaul. And ne'er did Fate, or human Wisdom yet, More proper Tools to the Employment fit: For who can help so well at a dead Lift, As those who always live by shark and shift? Most Members in Vacation take their pleasure, Or wast their time upon their private Treasure; Whilst these Great Publick Souls, humbly content With the bare Privilege of being pent, And safe ensconc'd within their Forts at home Against th'Assaults of Dun and dreadful Bum, Lay out their hireling Thoughts how to reduce The French, by bringing us to wooden Shoos. As the old Monky who his Tail had lost, Did the Convenience of bare Buttocks boast, Advise his Friends to the same Amputation, As the most useful and becoming Fashion; So Neal, who long since threw his Lands away, His Wife's Exchequer, Princes Boons at all, Has been his own Executor and Heir, And sunk his desp'rate Ruins past Repair, Whose Life all parts of Fortune's Wheel hath seen, And a meer Bubble in all Senses been; To level the whole Nation to his Size, Cries up th'Advantages of Blank and Prize; Loudly proclaims the only way to baffle The French, is to put all Estates in Raffle, Trust Chance with what you have already got, Draw Lots whether you shall eat Bread or not; Whilst he like State-Groom-Porter holds the Stakes, And out of all Events a Living makes: So drunken Vintner meeting with Mishap, Shrinks into Drawer, and still lives by th'Tap. Th'amphibious Doctor, who more Years hath spent In making Mortar than Medicament, Many fair Palaces and Fields defac'd, And stately Nothings on the same Spots plac'd, Has made the Suburbs to outswell the Town, Yet ha'nt a Hut which he dares call his own; In new Foundations has the Ruins laid Of many Artists whom he never paid; Stuff'd the Kings-Bench, the Fleet, Mint and White-Fryars With broken building Knights, Alsatia Squires; T'avoid which Fate himself was forc'd to tamper For a dear Bargain with the Men of Bramber. He weary grown of ruining by Retail, Gravely prescribes Destruction by Wholesale. As if the cursed Spirit of your Pool Had in a double share inform'd this Tool, Would lay our new-erected Fences wast, And th'Glory of the Revolution blast; Revive damn'd Chimney-Mony, and impose Gabels on Childrens warming Hands and Toes; If Doctor-like the Builder would advise, Close-stools and Urinals should pay Excise. Unhappy sure must be that Nation's Fate, Where Quacks and Cullies do direct the State. Britannia listned at the Senate-house, And groaning spake thus, with contracted Brows: This House, once my stout Guard of Property, Now harbours sniveling Pimps to Beggary; A pack of senseless Fools, as well as Knaves, Who take a Bribe, and sell themselves for Slaves: But thus it must be (letting fall a Tear) Whilst Officers and Pensioners sit here, Whilst by self-ended Knaves deluded Kings Make England's Int'rest and their own two things. On some Votes against the Lord S. When Envy does at Athens rise, And swells the Town with Murmurs loud, Not Aristides, Just and Wise, Can scape the moody factious Crowd. Each Vote augments the common Cry, While he that holds the fatal Shell, Can give no Cause, or Reason why, But being Great, and doing Well. The Confederates: or the first Happy Day of the Island Princess. Ye vile Traducers of the Female Kind, Who think the Fair to Cruelty inclin'd, Recant your Error, and with Shame confess, Their tender Care of Skipwith in Distress. For now to vindicate this Monarch's Right, The Scotch and English equal Charms unite; In solemn Leagues contending Nations join, And Britain labours with the vast Design: An Opera with loud Applause is play'd, Which fam'd Motteux in soft Heroicks made, And all the sworn Confederates resort To view the Triumph of their Sov'reigns Court; In bright Array the well-train'd Host appears, Supreme Command brave Darentwater bears. And next in Front George Howard's Bride does shine, The living Honour of that antient Line. The Wings are led by Chiefs of matchless Worth, Great Hamilton, the Glory of the North, Commands the left; and England's dear Delight, The bold F?ter, charges on the Right. The Prince to welcome his propitious Friends, A Throne erected on the Stage ascends. He said: Blest Angels for great Ends design'd, The best (and sure the fairest) of your Kind, How shall I praise, or in what Numbers sing Your just Compassion of an injur'd King? Till you appear'd no Prospect did remain My Crown and falling Scepter to maintain, No noisy Beaux in all my Realm were found, No beauteous Nymphs my empty Boxes crown'd. But still I saw (O dire heart-breaking Wo!) My own sad Consort in the foremost Row: But this Auspicious Day new Empire gives, And if by your Support my Nation lives, For you my Bards shall tune the sweetest Lays, Norton and Henly shall resound your Praise; And I, not last of the Harmonious Train, Will give a loose to my Poetick Vein. To him Great Darentwater thus replied: Thou Mighty Prince in many Dangers try'd, Born to dispute severe Decrees of Fate, The nursing Father of a sickly State; Behold the Pillars of thy lawful Reign, Thy Regal Rights we promise to maintain; Our brightest Nymphs shall thy Dominions grace With all the Beauties of the Highland Race; The Beaux shall make thee their peculiar Care, (For Beaux will always wait upon the Fair) For thee kind Bereton and bold Web shall fight, Lord Scot shall ogle, and my Spouse shall write: Thus shall thy Court our English Youth engross, And all the Scotch from Drummond down to Ross. Now in his Throne the King securely sate, But O! this Change alarm'd the Rival State; Besides he lately brib'd in breach of Laws, The fair Deserter of her Uncle's Cause. This rouz'd the Monarch of the neighbouring Crown, A drowsy Prince too careless of Renown, Yet prompt to Vengeance and untaught to yield, Great Scarsdale challeng'd Skipwith to the Field. Whole Shoals of Poets for this Chief declare, And Vassal Players attend him to the War. Skipwith with Joy the dreadful Summons took, And brought an equal Force: Then Scarsdale spoke; Thou Bane of Empire, Fo to Human kind, Whom neither Leagues nor Laws of Nations bind, For Cares of high Poetick Sway unfit, Thou Shame of Learning and Reproach of Wit; Restore bright Helen to my longing Sight, Or now my Signal shall begin the Fight. Hold, said the Fo, thy warlike Host remove, Nor let our Bard the Chance of Battel prove; Shou'd Death deprive us of their shining Parts, What would become of all the Liberal Arts? Should Dennis fall, whose high Majestick Wit And awful Judgment like to Tallies fit, Adiue strong Odes and every lofty Strain, The Tragick Rant, and proud Pindarick Vein. Shou'd tuneful Durfey now resign his Breath, The Lyrick Muse would scarce survive his Death: But should Divine Motteux untimely die, The gasping Nine would in Convulsions lie. For these bold Champions safer Arms provide, And let their Pens the double Strife decide. The King consents, and urg'd by publick Good, Wisely retreats to save his Peoples Blood. The moving Legions leave the dusty Plain, And safe at home Poetick Wars maintain. A Dialogue between Poet Motteux and Patron Henningham. Poet. Enter I told you, Sir, it would not pass; Why wou'd you make me such an Ass, To own, for sake of piteous Pelf, Your Dedication to your self? The Cheat is out; for all the Town Full forty years your Stile has known. Patron. Pray Brother Motteux, hold your Tongue, Some Coxcomb has inform'd you wrong; For ten years since, a Wager lost, Prov'd me but Forty six at most: And Stile like mine was never seen In full Perfection at Sixteen. Which Argument does plainly show It was not known so long ago. Besides, how can you think me old, Who now my Air and Dress behold; Who hear me sing, and see me caper? Godz—you take me sure for Napper. Poet. Forgive me Sir, but Dryden swore To me, you were at least threescore; And 'tis but just I should depend On him who does my Works commend: Oft have I been inform'd by him, That you two flourish'd at a time; That he in Verse, and you in Prose, By equal steps to Glory rose, When to a Dame wry-facd and old, You did the Place of Stallion hold. Patron. The Dotard lies, for Ladies know That stil my Veins with Vigor flow; With Joy their tender Limbs I press, And thrice a day some Beauty bless; Wasting my Spirits without measure, To give intolerable Pleasure. But how, Dear Brother, was it known That I should write what you did own? Poet Alas the thing, Sir, is too plain, And all your Oaths and mine are vain. What Pen, but yours, cou'd e'er express Such Care of Beauty in Distress? Such Honourable Hands prepare, And Hospitable Walls for her? What Author, but your self, can tell, That you divide your Time so well, Between the Witty, Wise, and Fair, And to 'em all so grateful are? Form'd to improve, to cheer, to charm, To touch their Souls, their Hearts to warm; To tast their Sweets, their Graces rifle, And so agreeably to trifle: But above all the Proof's point blank, That none could tell the warlike Prank Play'd in the Plains of Judah, when The Henningham and Saracen, The Turks and Christians to delight, With Heads alike engag'd in Fight. Patron. I must confess I was to blame, That one Particular to name; The rest could never have been known, I made the Stile so like thy own. Poet. I beg your Pardon, Sir, for that. Patron. Why, d? me, what would you be at? I writ below my self, you Sot, Avoiding Figures, Tropes, what not: For fear I should my Fancy raise Above the Level of thy Plays. Poet. There was no Danger, Sir, alas! But 'tis not matter, let that pass: From some I can expect no less; Uninterrupted good Success My Works to Envy does expose, And shining Merit makes me Foes. But while the Learned World admires The little Flight my Muse inspires, I'll calmly let Detractors lie In their deserv'd Obscurity; And for their Malice I defy 'em, 'Tis shewn to better Pens than I am. Patron. Nay now thy self thou usest ill, What art thou dwindled to a Quill? Poet. Why there's the thing; let us express Our Thoughts above the vulgar Dress; Strait those that never read Longinus, To lower Phrases would confine us; But better Judges know my Merit, And would be ready to declare it, Were not Words wanting to commend So great a Poet, good a Friend. But since you criticize me so, Equip me pray, and let me go. Patron. Here, Sirrah, here's five Guineas then. Poet. What do you mean? you promis'd ten; And Norton gave a hundred Pieces, To own a better thing than this is, Even to Southern, whom you see Dryden commended, less than me. Patron. Lord! Peter, what a stir you keep here? Tom Dufey woul dhave done it cheaper. Nay Gildon told me, he was willing To own the thing for forty Shilling. Poet. Nay Gad, if you despise the matter, Morbleu I'll take it out in Satyr. There was an antient Grecian Poet (Tho I suppose you hardly know it) That made a Trade of writing Fellows With keen lambicks to the Gallows. Patron. How now, you Puppy, do you threaten? God d? my Bl?, I'll have you beaten. Here—where are all those Sons of Whores? Go—kick that Rascal out of doors. Exit Poet. A Letter from J. P. to Colonel H. occasion'd by the Colonel's two late Letters. O Harry, canst thou find no Subject fit, But thy best Friend, to exercise thy Wit; No Order but the Toast to ridicule? Why with things sacred dost thou play the Fool? Sadly condemn'd (the Poets common Curse) Still to be writing, and still writing worse. Thy first Essay was with some Fancy fir'd, Thy last was by some Grubstreet Muse inspir'd; So harsh the Numbers, Raillery so gross, Sure 'twas translated out of Scotch by Ross. Is this thy Gratitude for all the Wine The Knight's bestow'd, who never tasted thine? And dost thou thus our Mysteries disclose, And in rude Rhime our President expose? How oft hast thou with awful Silence heard The midnight Lectures of that Reverend Bard, When with his Glass in Hand he doth unfold What Faith the Priests of all Religions hold; What old Socinus, and Molinos teach, And what the modern Philadelphians preach; What nice Remark's each different Tongue affords, And curious Etymologies of Words? Then he goes on to search Decrees of Fate, And give strong Proofs about a future State: Not old Silenus so divinely spoke Of hidden Truths in Virgil's sacred Book, When with a load of Wine and Knowledg fraught, The drunken God the listning Satyrs taught; And dost thou thus his Care and Pains requite, To make thee learned in thy own Despite? Hard Fate of Greatness! tho a Man should be As wise as Ashly, or refin'd like thee, Like Fletcher should for England's Glory toil, And plot as deep as Monmouth, or as Moyle, Yet Barber, B?y, and such Wits as those, Would find out something in him to expose. Thrice happy B?, who alike does prove Successful in Affairs of State and Love; Grave as Sir Harry in a Council-Chair, Yet smart as Archer to engage the Fair. Such are his Mien, his Person, and his Parts, He sems by Nature form'd to gain their Hearts; And such his Prudence to protect their Fame, Safe are his Darts, and innocent his Flame: None e'er for him provok'd her Husband's Rage, Nor stood recorded yet in Walker's Page. The Jealous trust him with their Wives alone, Who guards them from all Arrows but his own. Bold to attack, yet skilful to defend, He plays at once the Lover and the Friend; But he's a Theme too lofty for thy Pitch, Aim not at things that are above thy reach Mildmay seems fitting for a Stile like thine, And William Pawlet in thy Works would shine; Lord Ratcliff's Poems might thy Satyr fit, But what hast thou to do with Men of Wit? Resign the Task to some sublimer Muse, To tell what Beauties Burl?n pursues, What powerful Charms did Angelesea recal, And who now warms the Heart of gentle Maule; What lovely Youth Boyle fondly doth caress, Or strowling Punk does brawny Granvile bless; What new Swivante Manwaring will clap, And who by Walsh is destin'd to a Rape; How Therrold still for Mazareen doth burn, And Lady Mary does lost Kingston mourn. Well it becomes wise William's rightful Heir To fix his serious Inclinations there. Where solid Prudence the fit Choice commends, And from the Mother Chastity descends. But groundless Fears oblig'd him to desist, And no bold Man will venture to be blest, Till Heaven provides, the Family to grace, Some daring Hero of the Regal Race. But these are Subjects that surpass thy Rhimes, Draw thou the Fops or Husbands of the Times, Or if to charge the fair thy Fancy moves, Write Popham's Life or Madam Griffin's Loves. One Labour too to Ranelagh is due, Who with false Beauty does deface the true; And may arrive with Diligence and Care In time to rival Darentwater's Heir, On such as these thy Doggrel Numbers try, And fresh Memoirs Lord Edward will supply. But all whose Beauty and whose Vertue shine, Should be protected from such Pens as thine: From them, dear Harry, modestly abstain, Nor ever more Immortal Charms profane. More I could say, but Business must not wait, And I to day must open a Debate. If after all the Criticks tell us right, Who say some other did those Rhymes indite, And set thy Name to what thou didst not write; Then pardon this Impertinence in me, Who am thy most assured Friend J. P. A Satyr upon the French King. VVrit after the Peace was concluded at Reswick, Anno 1697. by a Non-swearing Parson, and said to be drop'd out of his Pocket at Sam's Coffee-House. And hast thou left old Jemmy in the Lurch! A Plague confound the Doctors of thy Church: Then to abandon poor Italian Molly; That I'ad the firking of thy Bum with Holly. Next to discard the virtuous Prince of Wales; How sutes this with the Honour of Versailes? Fourthly and lastly, to renounce the Turks; Why this is the Devil, the Devil and all his Works. Were I thy Confessor, who am thy Martyr, Dost think that I'd allow thee any Quarter? No—Thou shouldst find what 'tis to be a Starter. Lord! with what monstrous Lies and sensless Shams Have we been cullied all along at Sams? Who could have e'er believ'd, unless in spite, Lewis le Grand would turn rank Williamite? Thou that hast look'd so fierce, and talk'd so big, In thy old Age to dwindle to a Whig; By Heaven, I see thou'rt in thy Heart a Prig. I'd not not be for a Million in thy Jerkin, 'Fore George thy Soul's no bigger than a Gerkin. Hast thou for this spent so much ready Rhino? Now what the plague will become of Jure Divino? A Change so monstrous I cou'd ne'er have thought, Tho Partridg all his Stars to vouch it brought; 'S life I'll not take thy Honour for a Groat. Even Oaths with thee are only things of Course, Thou Z?, thou art a Monarch for a Horse. Of Kings distress'd thou art a fine Securer, Thou mak'st me swear, that am a known Non-Juror. But tho I swear thus, as I said before, Know, King, I'll place it all upon thy Score. Were Job alive, and barter'd by such Shufflers, He'd outrail Oates, and curse both thee and Boufflers. For thee I've lost, if I can rightly scan 'em, Two Livings worth full eightscore Pound per Annum, Bonæ &amp; legalis Angliæ Monetæ, But now I'm clearly routed by the Treaty. Then Geese and Pigs my Table ne'er did fail, And Tithe-eggs merrily flew in like Hail, My Barns with Corn, my Cellars cram'd with Ale. The Dice are chang'd; for now, as I'm a Sinner, The Devil, for me, knows where to buy a Dinner: I might as soon, tho I were ne'er so willing, Raise a whole Troop of Horse, as one poor Shilling. My Spouse alas, must slant in Silks no more; Pray Heaven, for Sustenance, she turn not Whore: And Daughter Peggy too, in time, I fear, Wiill learn to take a Stone up in her Ear. My Friend have basely left me with my Place; What's worse, my very Pimples bilk my Face: And frankly my Condition to disclose, I most resent th'Ingratitude of my Nose, On which tho I have spent on Wine such store, It now looks paler than my Tavern Score. My double Chin's dismantled, and my Coat is Past its best days in Verbo Sacerdotis. My Breeches too this Morning, to my wonder, I found grown Schismaticks, and fal'n asunder. When first I came to Town with Houshold Clog, Rings, Watch, and so forth, fairly went for Prog. The antient Fathers next, in whom I boasted, Were soon exchang'd for Primitive Boil'd and Roasted, Since 'tis no Sin of Books to be a Glutton, I truck'd St. Austin for a Leg of Mutton; Old Jerom's Volumes next I made a Rape on, And melted down that Father for a Capon. When these were gone, my Bowels not to balk, I trespass'd most enormously in Chalk; But long I had not quarter'd upon tick, E'er Christian Faith, I found, grew monstrous sick; And now alas, when my starv'd Entrails croke, At Partner How's I dine and sup on Smoke: In fine, the Government may do its Will, But I'm afraid my Guts will grumble still. Dennis of Sicily, as Books relate, Sir, When he was tumbl'd from the Regal State, Sir, (Which by the by I hope will be your Fate, Sir) And his good Subjects left him in the Lurch, Turn'd Pedagogue, and tyranniz'd in Birch. Tho thus the Spark was taken a Peg lower, Some feeble Signs of his old State he bore, And reign'd o'er Boys, that govern'd Men before. For thee I wish some Punishment that worse is; Since then thou'st spoil'd my Prayers, now hear my Curses. May thy Affairs (for so I wish by Heavens) All the World o'er at Sixes lie and Sevens; May Conti be impos'd on by the Primate, And forc'd in hast to leave the Northern Climate; May he rely upon their Faith and try it, And have his Belly full of Polish Dyet; May Maintenon, tho thou so long hast kept her, With Brand-venereal singe thy Royal Scepter; May all the Poets that thy Fame have scatter'd, Un-god thee now, and damn what once they flatter'd; The Pope and thou be never Cater-Cousins, And Fistula's thy Arse-hole seize by Dozens. Thus far in Jest; but now to pin the Basket, May'st thou to England come, of Jove I ask it, Thy wretched Fortune, Lewis there to prop, I hope thou'lt in the Fryars take a Shop; Turn puny Barber there, bleed louzy Carmen, Cut Corns for Chimny-sweepers and such Vermin; Be forc'd to trim (for such I'm sure thy Fate is) Thy own poor Hugonots, and us Non-Jurors gratis. May Savoy likewise with thee hither pack, And carry a Raree-show upon his back. May all this happen, as I've put my Pen to't, And may all Christian People say Amen to't. On Madam Mohun and Mr. Congreve's Sickness. One fatal Day a Sympathetick Fire, Seiz'd Him that writ, and Her that inspire. Mohun the Muses Theme, their Master Congreve, Beauty and Wit had like to've lain in one Grave. Engrav'd on a Medal of the French King's. Second to Jove alone, in whom unite Unbounded Virtue with unbounded Might; Whether to succour Innocents opprest, Or quell those Monsters which the World infest. In vain the Titans against Heaven combine, In vain th'embattl'd Squadrons pass the Rhine, Theirs is the Eagle, but the Thunder's thine. On Fortune, by the Duke of Buckingham. Fortune made up of Toys and Impudence, That common Jade that has not common Sense; But fond of Business, insolently dares Pretend to rule, yet spoil the World's Affairs. She fluttering up and down, her Favours throws On the next Man, not minding what she does, Nor why nor whom she helps or injures knows. Sometimes she smiles, then like a Fury raves, And seldom truly loves but Fools and Knaves. Let her love whom she please, I scorn to woo her, While she stays with me I'll be civil to her. But if she offers once to move her Wings, I'll throw her back all her vain Gewgaw things; And arm'd with Virtue will more glorious stand, Than if the Bitch still bent at my Command: I'll marry Honesty, tho ne'er so poor, Rather than follow such a dull blind Whore. On Madam Behn. 1. The Gods are not more blest than he, Who fixing his glad Eyes on thee, With thy bright Rays his Senses cheers, And drinks with ever-thirsty Ears: The charming Musick of thy Tongue Does ever here and ever long, That sees with more than human Grace, Sweet Smiles adore thy Angel Face. 2. But when with kinder Beams you shine, And so appear much more Divine, My feebled Sense and dazled Sight No more support the glorious Light, And the fierce Torrent of Delight. O then I feel my Life decay, My ravish'd Soul then flies away; Then Faintness does my Limbs surprize, And Darkness swims before my Eyes. 3. Then my Tongue fails, and from my Brow The liquid Drops in Silence flow; Then wandring Fire runs thro my Blood, Then Cold binds up the languid Flood; All pale and breathless then I lie, I sigh, I tremble, and I die. A Song on the Taxes, 1696. The attribution of this poem is questionable. 1 Good People, what will you of all be bereft? Will you never learn Wit while a Penny is left? You are all like the Dog in the Fable betray'd, To let go the Substance and snatch at the Shade: Your specious Pretences and foreign Expences, We war for Religion and wast all our Chink, 'Tis nipt and 'tis clipt, 'tis lent and 'tis spent, Till 'tis gone, till 'tis gone to the Devil I think. 2 We pay for our New-born, we pay for our Dead, We pay if we're single, we pay if we're wed, To show that our merciful Senate don't fail To begin at the Head and tax down to the Tail. We pay thro the Nose by subjecting Foes, Yet for all our Expences get nothing but Blows; At home we are cheated, abroad we're defeated, But the end on't, the end on't the Lord above knows. 3 We parted with all our old Mony, to shew We foolishly hope for a Plenty of new; But might have remember'd, when we came to the push, That a Bird in the Hand is worth two in the Bush. We now like poor Wretches are kept under Hatches, At Rack and at Manger like Beasts in the Ark; Since our Burgesses and Knights make us pay for our Lights, Why should we, why should we be kept in the dark? Regulus's Death by Carthage two VVays. 1 When the bold Carthaginian Fought with Rome for Dominion, Little Reg. was ta'en in the Quarrel; They led him up a Hill, And sore against his Will They tumbled him down in a Barrel. 2 When the bold Carthaginian Fought with Rome for Dominion, Little Reg. was ta'en in the Strife; When his Eye-lids they par'd, Good Lord how he star'd, And could not go to sleep for his Life. To King WILLIAM. In Council wise, in War so great a Man, What Age did e'er produce, or ever can? Brutus himself this best of Kings would love, The wise Fabricius would to Court remove; And Cato too, whom Cæsar could not tame, Would now a Subject live with greater Fame. Martial. Lib 1. Epig. 58. Would you know, if I should change my Life, What kind of Girl I'd chuse to make my Wife; I would not have her be so fond to say Yes at first dash, nor dwell too long on Nay; These two Extremes I hate, then let her be 'Twixt both, not too hard-hearted, nor too free. Cure for Green Sickness, 1702. As fair Olinda sat beneath a shady Tree, Much Love I did profer to her, and she the like to me; But when I kiss'd her lovely Lips, and press'd her to be kind, She cry'd O no, but I remember, Womens words are Wind. I hug'd her till her Breath grew short, then farther did intrude, She scratch'd and struggl'd modestly, and told me I was rude. I beg'd her Pardon 20 times, and some Concern did feign, But like a bold presumptuous Sinner did the same again. At last I did by Dalliance raise the pretty Nymph's Desire, Our Inclinations equal were, and mutual was our Fire. Then in the height of Joy she cry'd, O I'm undone I fear O kill me, stick me; stick me, kill me; kill me quite my Dear. Found on the Church-Door at Whitehall, January 30. 1696. What, fast and pray For the horrid Murder of the Day! And at the same time drive the Son away, The Royal Father and the Royal Son? While by your Praying you their Rights do own. Go ask your Learned Bishop and your Dean, What these strange Contradictions mean; And cease to fast and pray and trouble Heaven, Sins, whilst unrepented, cannot be forgiven. Epitaph on King WILLIAM, 1702. William the Third lies here, th'Almighty's Friend, A Scourge to France, a Check t'Imperious Rome, Who did our Rights and Liberties defend, And rescu'd England from its threaten'd Doom; Heav'n snatch'd him from us whom our Hearts caress'd, And now he's King in Heaven among the Blest, Grief stops my Pen; Reader pray weep the rest. On the Lord Lovelace's coming to Oxford from Glocester Gaol in Decem. 1688. 1 A late Expedition to Oxford was made By a Protestant Peer and his Brother o'th blade, Who in Triumph his Lordship from Glocester convey'd, Which no body can deny. 2 Had you seen all his Mirmidons when they came to us, Equipt in their thred-bare grey Coats and high Shoos, You'd have sworn not the Goal, but Hell was broke loose, Which, &amp;c. 3 In rank and in file there rode many a Man, Some march'd in the Rear and some in the Van, And for want of their Hats they had Head-pieces on, Which, &amp;c. 4 Tho Arms were not plenty, yet armed they come With stout oaken Plants and Crabtree Sticks some, To cudgel the Pope and the bald Pate of Rome, Which, &amp;c. 5 Some had two able Legs, but never a Boot, And on their Tits mounted they stood stoutly to't, But for the Name of a Horse they'd as good went on foot, Which, &amp;c. 6 In all these gay Troops, 'mongst twenty scarce one Had Halbert or Pistol, Sword, Carabine or Gun; A Sign they did mean no great harm should be done, Which, &amp;c. 7 One Horse wore a Halter among the rest, Nor had the dull Wight half the Sense of his Beast, And he of the two did deserve the Rope best, Which, &amp;c. 8 Here were many Gallants I warrant you that Had Ribbons of Orange and Seamans Cravat, The Defect of their Arms was made up in State, VVhich, &amp;c. 9 Here Mordant and G? on their pamper'd Steeds prance, D? Brab?, G? next, and J. Willis advance, Who phyz'd at the Switzer that can'd him in France, VVhich, &amp;c. 10 In this Cavalcade, for the Grace of the matter, Lord Lovelace rode first, and the next follow'd after, They gallopt up Town first, and then down to Water, VVhich, &amp;c. 11 The Mayor and his Brethren in courteous Fashion, Bid him welcome to Town in a fine pen'd Oration, And thank'd him for taking such Care of the Nation, VVhich, &amp;c. 12 His Honour the next day in Courtship exceeding, Return'd a smart Speech to shew them his Breeding, Which when 'tis in print will be well worth the reading, VVhich, &amp;c. 13 Having thus far proceeded to secure the Town, The Guards were strait set, and the Bridges beat down, And tho no great Courage, yet his Conduct was shown, VVhich, &amp;c. 14 Next Night's Alarum our Warriours surprize, Drums beat, Trumpets sound, and at Midnight all rise To fight the King's Army that came in disguise, Which, &amp;c. 15 The Cits were strait armed, expert Men and able, With Prongs and with Coal-staffs march'd next whooping Rabble, In as great a Confusion as ever was Babel, Which, &amp;c. 16 In the midst of the Mob two fat Draymen appear, To guard Mr. Ensign a huge nasty Tar, Who flourish'd a Blanket for Colours of War, Which, &amp;c. 17 Since England was England, no People e'er scarce So pleasantly burlesq'd the angry God Mars, Or of Affairs warlike e'er made such a Farce, Which, &amp;c. 18 At the foot of the Colours blith Craudon did go, Who play'd a new Tune you very well know, His Bagpipes squeak'd nothing but Lero, Lero, Which, &amp;c. 19 And had the Dear Joys now but come in the nick, I fancy they had shown them a slippery Trick, And march'd more nimbly without their Musick, Which no Body can deny. A Song. [Talk Strephon no more of what's honest and just] Talk Strephon no more of what's honest and just, For Friendship is Int'rest, and Love is but Lust; To the Purse and no farther the one does extend, And after Enjoyment your Love's at an end. Then no longer maintain what your Actions deny, Your oft-broken Vows your Assertions bely: When I once see your Words with your Patience agree, I'll believe you the Man that you now seem to be. That you once have deceiv'd me I do not complain, But 'tis my own Fault if you cheat me again; For none will the Fate of that Pilot deplore, Who racks on that Shelf where he stranded before. Another. [In a dark silent shady Grove] 1 In a dark silent shady Grove Fit for the Delights of Love, As on Corinna's Breast I panting lay, My right Hand playing with &amp; cætera. 2 A thousand Words and amorous Kisses Prepar'd us both for more substantial Blisses; And thus the hasty Moments slipt away, Lost in the Transport of &amp; cætera. 3 She blush'd to see her Innocence betray'd, And the small Opposition she had made, Yet hug'd me close, and with a Sigh did say, Once more, my Dear, once more &amp; cætera. 4 But O the Power to please this Nymph was past, Too violent a Flame can never last; So we remitted to another Day The prosecution of &amp; cætera. On the Divorces by Parliament, 1701. Woman, thou worst of all Church-plagues, Farewel, Bad at the best, but at the worst a Hell; Thou Truss of Wormwood, bitter Tease of Life, Thou Nursery of humane Cares, a Wife; Thou Apple-eating Traytor, who began The Wrath of Heaven, and Miseries of Man; And hast with never-failing Diligence Improv'd the Curse to Human Race e'er since. Farewel Church-Juggle that enslav'd my Life, But bless that Power that rid me of my Wife: And now the Laws once more have set me free, If Woman can again prevail with me, My Flesh and Bones shall make my Wedding Feast, And none shall be invited as my Guest, But my good Bride, the Devil and a Priest. Some Verses found in the Ruins of the Privy Garden, which were carried to the Gentleman Usher, written in a Scroll of Parchment. When a Knight of the North is lop'd in Ax-yard, By a biting Peer's trick having play'd a wrong Card; When at the Green Cloth a Gray does preside, And a Wolf in a Chain thro the City does ride; When Chalk pays for Cheese, Gold dwindles to Wood, And Banks rather let in, than keep out the Flood; When Grocers-Hall fears to be sent to the Counter, And Faith Publick's so light that a Feather will mount her; When the Coin scarcer grows as the Mints do increase, And we're maul'd with a War without hope of a Peace; When the Ocean's so Frenchifi'd few Ships do ride in't, And is rul'd by a Shovel instead of a Trident; When Justice is forc'd to abandon the Land, Tho most People are seen with Scales in their Hand; When a pack of Brib'd Knaves does a Chappel disgrace, Who deserve the same Fate with the Saint of the Place; When London's great Wit is shewn in a C?ddon, And a Man with a Nose does things that he shoud'nt; Then England, I tell you, you are cursedly sham'd, It's too late to repent, sin on and be damn'd. The Life and Actions of that Valiant Hero Robert Blake Esq; General of the Fleets of the Commonwealth of England, from the Year 1649. to 1657. when he died in Plimouth Sound much lamented. An Historical Poem. Renowned Blake, what Trumpet may be found, That can thy matchless Praises duly sound; Or what Seraphick Pen, that can set forth, In fitting Measures thy transcendent Worth? And justly warble forth in saddest Strains, Thy Death, and Loss thereby the Land sustains? Is that Sidneian Spirit, with his Dust, Extinct? or for this mournful Subject must Heroick Spencer, and that sweet Divine Dubartas, rais'd be from their resting Shrine, Thy signal unexampled Acts to sing, Of which the whole World doth already ring? Which if in order we must needs recount, Our mean unpolish'd Quill they far surmount, That to thy Merit we shall in debt remain, So great a Sum not able to attain: Leaving a richer Pen the same to pay, Whilst in the common Stock our Mite we lay. When first Bellona did fair Albion greet With dreadful Larums in the open Street; And when that high and Roman-like Dispute Of the Militia, did in Field recruit Two Armies, 'twixt the late unhappy King And Parliament, from whence, as from a Spring, Ran Seas of Blood throughout this Isle, which had Drown'd all, but that Jehovah it forbad: Commissions of Array are issu'd out, Which do disturb the trembling Land throughout. Blake now stands up without Delay or Fear, 'Gainst the Tyrannick Levies doth appear; And with those noble Patriots of the West, A Captain of stout Foot, himself addrest With their associate Troops to march, and face The Royal Forces, who with nimble pace Quitting the Field, to Sherborne do retreat, That antient Castle, Digby's stately Seat: From thence are forc'd with tedious March to fly To the Cornubian Mountains strong and high; And there divided, some away do post, Through swelling Severn to the Cambrian Coast, And fenced Hills of Wales for shelter, where Th'old Britains by the Romans chased were. So after many signal Proofs shewn forth Of his Heroick Prowess and true Worth, At Bodmyn, Bristol, and at Lansdown Fight, And at Born there, 1598. Bridgewater (where he first saw Light) Tho by just Providence and Heaven's Decree, We were deny'd a Conquest yet to see; And Royal Charles did subjugate the West, And two full Winters had the same possest. He now arriveth to the Council great, Thereof a Member, to consult and treat Of State-Concernments (where sometimes did vote His grave Progenitors, there to promote The Common Good) and so with great Applause, 'Mongst other Worthies, he that Publick Cause, 'Twixt Prince and People then in high Debate, Is call'd with Dint of Sword to vindicate: And speedily on Neptune's Chariot sent, Commander of a valiant Regiment, Rais'd by stout Popham of illustrious Rank, And timely landing on the Western Bank. I. Lyme to relieve, that old Maritime Seat By faithful Celey kept with hazard great, Near gasping, as beleaguer'd strongly by A Rhenish Prince's Army strong and high, Form'd of all Nations, who like ravenous Bears, Thirst after English Blood; whilst he prepares Himself for Sallies, and thro Help Divine The bold Assailants slays like Herds of Swine; Prince Maurice still recruits, still is repel'd With Loss of Thousands, and at last compel'd To quit the Leaguer with his Princely Train, Not daring fiery Lyme to face again. II. He having now paid to Jehovah High 1644. His Vows and Thanks for his first Victory, In Triumph hence doth march, bent to set free The neighbouring Places that in Thraldom be, (Assisted by stout Pye from Essex sent, That Peer renown'd, in Arms so eminent) To that strong Castle founded by King Ine, Of Saxon Race, seated as 'twere on Rhine, Or rather Eden sweet, a Land so blest, Call'd vulgarly, the Garden of the West. And herein yet more happy, that brave Blake, His first Breath in this fertile Soil did take; 'Gainst this strong Hold, call'd Taunton, that fair Town, (By high born Stawel kept) he sitteth down, Soon forcing the Besieged to submit To his Conditions; They forthwith do quit A Princely Garison, stor'd plenteously With all Provisions, here he worthily Is now ordained Governour; but he, As born to high Atchievements, will not be Embas'd with Rest and Sloth, but prudently Foresees approaching Storms; for suddenly Great Forces under Wyndham are drawn out, This growing Garison to quell and rout: Whilst with few Men, but by him spirited, And by his Fortitude and Wisdom led, With Sallies strong, the potent Foe he plies, That with great Loss, and greater Shame he flies. III. Yet here the Royal Party will not rest, But fresh Alarums do him still infest: On sudden, lo, a formidable Host, Commanded by the Chieftains, and the most Stout Greenvil, Goring, Hopton, breathing out Nought else but Fire and Sword the Camp throughout. Here might you hear the Irish Tories thunder More hideous Threats than Cannon, that asunder The Castle seem'd to rend: Lo like a Flood, Great Multitudes have broke the Line, now Blood Is like to dye fair Tone, or rather make New Rivers in the Streets, all lies at stake; Women and Children, nought but ghastly Death Beholding, and half dead do gasp for Breath. Yet here great Wonders wrought by those May 1645. Tauntonian Blades, the overflowing Foes Are bravely check'd, and stopped at a Bay, And forc'd to fight at Pistol-shot by day And night, from house to house, until the Foe Repuls'd, such Fury could not undergo. Now are made good the words sometimes he spake, By Inches they their bloody way should make; And yet poor Souls, have lost their way at last, As into Darkness and Confusion cast. And when that Goring sent to him in scorn A tatter'd Drum (best suting their forlorn Condition) for exchange of Pris'ners, he Them kindly treats, and quickly sets them free; And like himself, or like that Grecian Prince, The falling Foe with Kindness doth convince: This one Exchange doth to the other add, Returns the Nuncio with new Raiment clad. Yea to their great astonishment, upon Their taking of a neighbouring Garison, Insulting proudly with great Threats and Jeers, The Church's Bells he ringeth in their Ears, And thereby quickly checks their Pride and Rage, Of their ensuing Fall a sad Presage. Redoubted Weldon lo, that Man of Kent, With seasonable Succour hither sent, From th'Hills appears: The harass'd Foe again Doth raise the Siege, and fairly leaves his Slain By thousands to their Mother Earth, to feed The hungry Worms, which look'd before indeed For other Flesh, whilst Mercy with strong Hands, Out of the raging Fire pulls us as Brands. IV. The Kingly Forces never rest nor cease From their implacate Wrath, which doth increase, Still hotly thirsting for the Blood of those, Who merely in their own Defence arose. Fresh Armies now are levied, to pull down The haughty Courage of the sturdy Town, By a third Siege more dreadful than the rest, Which kindles Flames of Valour in the Breast Of this stout Hector, made for Dangers great, Like that great Greek that did Darius beat. Here Goring chief Commander vows to lay His Bones, or not retreat or march away, Till that proud Castle were reduc'd, just then When Naseby Battel wavering stood, and when He straitly summon'd was by Royal Call To aid his King on that Day Vertical. The gallant Governour well knowing all These Passages, together he doth call His Captains, cheers his warlike Boys, who like Lions fall on, and with Amazement strike The Royalists, whose stout Heart will not yield, Till master'd by a stouter in the Field. Here now that joyful Sound of Naseby-fight Was heard, like sweetest Musick for delight: After sad Thunder-cracks let England sing Still that appealing Victory, and bring Fresh Laurels to adorn that glorious Field, Whilst to th'Almighty we due Praises yield. Now Noble Fairfax doth victoriously March to relieve the Western Parts, that lie Opprest; the same at once relieves, and meets Another Conquest in brave Taunton Streets, Atchiev'd by Blake, who solemn Thanks ordains Unto the Highest, who for ever reigns. V. And now to march forthwith he doth prepare To Dunster, that strong towring Castle, where The wasting Pestilence of late did rage, April 1646. Which God was pleas'd on his approach t'asswage. The Foes great Obstinacy did him move To spring a Mine; the lofty Walls above Mount in the Air, some dead, some living are In those great Heaps blown up, the Fruits of War; At length dear Blake to thee they did resign This Castle, by Rendition now made thine. Thro Heav'ns fair Aspect now, auspicious Peace Begins to spring, and flagrant Arms to cease; To that great Senate he from bloody Fights Returns, there to assert the Peoples Rights: And he that was a Warriour stout of late, Doth now consult of arduous things of State; Well hoping in the end the Sword to see Into a pruning Hook might turned be. VI. But lo, sad Rumours from the British Main, Our Fleet revolted is, which doth a Train 1649. Of Troubles new, and great Combustions breed; For our great Sins a just vindictive Meed: Now this Brave Senator must once again Harness himself, more Honour yet to gain, For his great Merit elected General: And as the first Fruits of this publick Call, Those Princely Pirates from Kingsale doth rout, Rupert and Maurice both, two Princes stout; July. From thence he to th'Herculean Straits do's chase These German Exiles, who from place to place Pursu'd within th'Hetrurian Seas (which do The Worlds Terrestrial Globe divide in two) Are forced with their winged Fleet to fly Unto the Caribean Isles, to lie At Mercy of the Deep, and on that Coast The greatest part of those great Ships, yea most Of those seduced Souls with Maurice sink, As Lead in mighty Waters (sad to think!) VII. He now for Tagus Banks do's steer his Fleet, 1650. And with his thundring Squadrons Lisbon greet, Which did the English so much wrong of late, And for it must account unto the State. Mean while those rich Brasilian Ships arrive, Which with nine others outward bound do strive Him to escape in vain, near all made Prize By his successful Fleet, who like a wise As well as gallant Captain, by his Care For this great Spoil a Convoy doth prepare. With this mellifluous Trophy from Brazil, Which with its sweetness did all England fill, In Triumph homewards he his Course doth bend, Where Publick Service doth him still attend. Yea to his Praise this may recorded be, That as the End of War is Peace, so he (After full Reparation by them made To th'English) did restore both Peace and Trade. VIII. A famous Island, and of great Import To England, startled with the loud Report Of his amazing Actions, trembling stands: To this strong Isle begirt with Rocks and Sands He sails, and Greenvil summons (that stout Knight, Then Chief Commander there) the State to right By his Surrender, or he must be sure The Fury of his valiant Arm endure. Whilst Trump then hovering with his Fleet in vain Solicits with vast Sums the same to gain; At length upon Blake's sight he doth retreat, Or rather fly: By this Commander great, Now Scilly is reduced to the State, And Joy of English Merchants, who of late Could not for fear of this new Dunkirk trade, So rich and high by warlike Plundrings made. IX. Impregnate Dunkirk once our Friend, but now Our Foe, if Noble, will with Homage bow To him, as 'twere once holding in his Hands The Scales of France and Spain on either Sands: As Umpire he decides and weighs the Town Freely to Spain, for England's great Renown. Tho that Ledean Marquiss did him treat, And him caress'd in vain with Presents great: Yet not without a rich and glorious Prize As unto them, so to himself, whose wise And gallant Conduct six stout Ships did seize, No less than Princes stile we two of these; Great Neptune with his triple Scepter dread, Princess Maria eke with Crowned Head, All captive led by this great Admiral, Which did the Conquer'd French so much appal. X. Nor can we Jersey Isle in Silence pass, So near a Hostile Coast that seated was, And by a mighty Monarch then protected, From his black Storms, yet was by him subjected: Which France beholding from her lofty Strand, At such portentous Acts doth trembling stand, And seeing Holland since in humble wise Strike to our Flag, her Peace of England buys. XI. He yet engag'd is in more dreadful Fights, 1652. Which all the World on every Coast afrights: New Fires of War betwixt two Protestant And Neighbour Nations kindled are, which want Not Rome's Fomenters; which the British, French, And the Batavian Seas could hardly quench: That Thunder-striking and Dutch Admiral, Which Scilly late did court; that Hannibal, With fair Pretexts, attempteth to surprize Our Royal Downs, a Sore unto his Eyes. Our watchful Scipio, now in the Great James, By him made greater soon appears, and tames The Belgick Lion, with his roaring Whelps. Tho three to one, the Lord of Hosts still helps Such as on him in just Appeals depend, And to that righteous Judg their Cause commend. XII. Our new made Foe now beaten hence we see, 1652. Whose Fate pursues them, humbled more to be: The boundless Love of Trade, transports on post These famous Merchants to th'Orcadian Coast, To force our Caledonian Fishes there, Of whose Bones, as they bruit, first founded were The Walls of Amsterdam, that Magazine On Texel Banks, which to their Fleet hath been. He with his Eagle Fleet soon them pursues, Their num'rous Men of War sinks and subdues, The Busses takes; the one his Justice feels, The other tasts his Mercy: hence he wheels His winged Frigots, when our antient Right He had restor'd by his unconquer'd Might, And so with Shoutings homeward sails, where lo More dismal Actions he must undergo. XIII. And shall we Portland name, a Portland Fight, Febr. 1652. Where mortal Wound first seiz'd this noble Wight? Yet to his Glory; where behold, the High And Mighty States brought low, he gallantly Triumphing sails thro Seas of Belgick Blood, Tho wounded, whilst the Sun eclipsed stood; Thro that black Storm, and that tempestuous Fight Three Winters days (like a continual Night) Which lasted, whilst that he the Day to gain, Doth in his grisly Wounds on Deck remain, As in Triumphal Chair, would not retire For his more speedy Cure; but is on fire, And thereby with new Courage doth inflame His English Trojans, to their lasting Fame, But terror of the Foe, who now o'erthrown Post homewards, there this fatal Blow to moan. But stay, my Muse, here Noble Monk we must And Gallant Dean salute with Honour just, His brave Compeers, whose Gallantry shown here, Posterity in Leaves of Fame may hear. XIV. And after some small Interval of Rest, June 1653. Scarce cur'd he buckles for the last Contest Against the Dutch, tho much impaired by His Martial Hurts received formerly; Inducing him to say, he was more fit For some sick Hospital than brave De Wit And valiant Trump to fight: yet he again, With Mind above his Strength, and not in vain, Takes Neptune's Field, and on the Flemish Flood Relieves Brave Dean and Monk engag'd in Blood; Whose valiant Acts and high Atchievements then In that sharp Fight, deserve a golden Pen. The English Standard then by Blake display'd In Laureate Essex, finds the Foe dismay'd. Here now in Sight of both the Nations, you Great Earthquakes on each Shore might sadly view, Made by those horrid Thunders which did quell Their Navy, where their chiefest Old Van Trump kill'd. Pillar fell; With whose dear Blood the greatest Victory Was gained by our Fleet, for that hereby 'Twixt antient Friends is wrought a lasting Peace, For mutual Commerce, and their Joys encrease: His former Wish he now fulfill'd doth see, So often by him mention'd, that as he The Tragick Prologue of this War hath seen, So might a happy Period, which hath been Accomplish'd in his Eyes: Let Spain and Rome Hence read with Grief and Rage their fatal Doom. XV. And now we see the Seat of ghastly War Decemb. 1654. Remov'd from home to foreign Countries far, Unto a wrathful Foe inveterate, Whose Character in bloody Lines bear date From Eighty eight; and so unwearied Blake Plows up the Southern Seas, his way to make, And in those boistrous Floods to him well known Before proud Cadiz Strand, as on on his own, One Winter full did ride, which Drake did never, Nor Hawkins, or brave Forbisher endeavour, Nor yet the hardy Dutch, (whose proper Seat And Element is in the Waters great) Did e'er assay, tho all the World abroad, And both the Indies be their common Road. XVI. Prroud Malaga, how was thy roaring Mouth 1655. Muzled by him, the Terror of the South, When thy strong Mould was seiz'd, thy thundring Guns Speekt up, and all the Town afrighted runs? Thy warlike Fleet, tho scaping Storms and Winds Abroad, no Harbour in thy Harbours finds; But are destroy'd all in thy smoking Bay, Unto his fiery Engines made a Prey. XVII. How suddenly doth Vigo now bemoan The like Disaster with a howling Tone? When Vulcan, Mars, and Neptune all conspire Her Merchants and her Men of War by Fire And Sword to spoil: Whilst he doth leave the Port And Ships all flaming in prodigious sort. XVIII. Yea Tunis, that old punick City, quakes, 1655. And at great distance strong Alarum takes, As tho the Roman Legions on their Shoar Appear'd: The Turks are summon'd to restore Our English Goods and Captives, but refuse, And therefore must expect no other News Than Cannon Peals, whilst he doth seize their Port, And charge the Infidels up to their Fort. Twelve stately Ships of War behold in Flames Consuming are, whereby he quickly tames Their Cham-like Spirit by his unconquer'd Power, Whilst raging Fires the Vessels do devour. The poor Mahometans do trembling fly From their strong Holds to Mountains that were nigh; Whence like so many Fiends of blackest hue, (With scaring horrid Faces) they might view, In those sulphureous fiery Streams below, A new Gehenna, to their greater woe. A Day so dark, the Ottomanian fear'd A fall, and th'horned Moon in Blood appear'd, That old Republick, and brave Virgin City, Ne'er ravish'd yet by warlike Foe, tho pity So Romanized; that Virago stout, Which at Lepanto Fight the Turks did rout; Fair Venice now with Shouts doth gratulate The English African, who now in State From his late Conquest saileth by their Shoar, Where loudest Trumpets sound, where Cannons roar; (Leading his ransom'd ones, the Christian Slaves, From Turkish Yoke rescu'd as from their Graves) As if Triumphant Cæsar were in Sight, Returning now from the Pharsalian Fight. He leaving these poor Caitiffs to lament This doleful Loss, for more Exploits is bent. XIX. But where was now the Iberian God, that should 1656. Protect those Galleons huge, so fraught with Gold? That the Peruvian Mines exhaust were near, The golden Age again seem'd to appear. Was Baal journying then or else asleep, So great a Treasure could no better keep? Or did that Babylonish Prince now hope To be install'd fifth Monarch by the Pope? And build a new Escurial for so high A Majesty? Lo all triumphantly, In Streams of Spanish Blood near Cadiz Sands, Doth flow into those still victorious Hands Of him, and Noble Montague, his dear Collegue, now honour'd to convoy and steer This Princely Prize, and Treasure so immense Bound for th'Elysian Thames, design'd from thence A Present only for a Sovereign meet, A Conqueror of Kings, whom now we greet; A greater than that Macedonian Prince, Or any Hero that hath e'er been since; For he did mostly barbarous Foes defeat, This the most civil, warlike, truly great, With greatest joy uniting Nations three By threefold Cord, not ever like to be Dissolv'd, ne'er yet so firm in any Age, One Law, one Faith, one Blood, which may presage Fair Halcion days; our British Annals may Cromwel the Great we'll stile him from this day. The midland Seas which many Years him knew, And Tribute to him paid, bids now adieu To this European Ajax; ne'er again The like to see, while Sun and Moon remain. XX. The Islands falsly called Fortunate, Do trembling gaze at their approaching Fate. And where's a Homer now, that fully may His last stupendious Act to life pourtray? A Theme as Noble as the Trojan Story, Which fill'd all Pens and Ages with its Glory. He now against this Scarlet Whore of Rome, As born to execute the Written Doom, And as inspir'd (from all Fear exempt) The grand Canarian Cross he doth attempt, Which had the Indian Mines some few days past Near drain'd, and now possest those Treasures vast: Twice eight great warlike Ships he doth assail, And up unto the Castle Walls doth sail; All that great Fleet, those mighty Galleons, he With golden Argos burneth (sad to see) In those huge Bonfires made a Sacrifice Unto the Bacchanalian God: Whose Eyes Dim waxed to behold the Ocean wide By those Ætnean Fires almost dry'd, To see such Flames, and unheard Thunders hear, That Sancta Cruz, and all the Isle did fear On that black Day the World would be dissolv'd, And in another Chaos be involv'd. The Dolphins by those flashy clatterings scar'd, From their own proper Region are debar'd, And forc'd to fall into a watry Hell, Their sad Exile there to bewail and tell. The frighted Foot, which from the lined Strand Saw Seas of Blood, now will no longer stand, But from those fenced Walls and Bulwarks strong, To lofty Teneriff did run, among The craggy Rocks and Caves themselves to hide, Such blasting Storms not able to abide. What ailed thee, great Mountain and proud Peek, That shelter for thy self thou now didst seek? Who to thy forlorn Fugitives should be A Sanctuary, when they fled to thee. Why didst thou quake, sky-daring Mount, so high, That into Heaven thou presum'st to pry? From the Creation, seeming to be fixt Above the middle Region, and there mixt Amongst the Stars, from fiery Meteors free. Or didst thou fear, that now fulfill'd should be That sacred Prophecy? That by the Power Of Faith remov'd, the Seas should thee devour? Those Indian Silver-Mines, and Wealth so vast For Spanish Cræsus hither sent, are fast In durance kept, and like to perish here, Made useless to their Masters, or in fear Of English Frigots, that perhaps may seize Those Golden Heaps, if they appear on Seas. XXI. Hence fully fraught with Glory, now he steers His course for Sally (where he soon appears) That little Egypt, and most doleful Cell, Which held some of our English Israel In Bonds; he maketh there a Noble Peace, And freely doth the Christian Slaves release: Whence gone, he takes another glorious Spoil, Still Providence on his Designs doth smile. XXII. A little Army of Canarian Dons, 1657. From th'Indies come, he taketh, now in Bonds Attending this great Victor, to perform Their Obsequies to him in solemn Form; Who, after thousand Storms, to which enur'd He was, and noble Wounds by him endur'd, Of which he languish'd, now return'd in Peace To English Port, did there alas decease, Yet gloriously, where he did sacrifice For us his dearest Blood, Death's great Prize; When many hundreds he had ta'ne of late, Now to a Royal Chappel brought in State, For his Devotion ye'rst to him well known, Amongst the Kings inter'd, and near to one, That Prince of Peace, which join'd in Hymen's Band The two divided Houses of our Land. If now some British Plutarch, kindly prest With Love of Vertue sparkling in his Breast, Should in Historick Stile limm out this Brave And English Aristides, and from Grave Redeem his Memory; for his Renown, This one thing more (his worthy Deeds to crown) May added be, the Glory of them all, That during those long Wars, wherein the fall Of thousands he beheld, as many rise To Fortunes high, (true Valours Meed and Prize) Yet he postponing with Heroick Zeal, His private Interest to the publick Weal, Himself would not advance by those vast Spoils, Still him attending from those bloody Broils, (Tho Millions seiz'd by his Conduct, so skill'd In Arms and Counsel, the English Coffers fill'd) Who with his Native portion well content, For his dear Countrys good was gladly spent. What Marble Pile, what Monument for thee, Great Britain's Shield, Spain's Scourge, now rais'd shall be? That may our English Heroes animate, Thy matchless Worth (brave Blake) to emulate; And to succeeding Times eternize may Thy Name, and thee entitle from this day A Saint devout, for Learning Socrates, A Cato Just, for Valour Hercules. And thou Great Oliver, thy Sword gird on: Ride forth and prosper, Truth's great Champion, Against that Romish Beast; Jehovah send Such Leaders still, thy high Designs t'attend: That so that Glorious Work, advanc'd so far Against proud Babel, by a Holy War, Under thy Conduct may yet farther thrive, And to perfection in the end arrive; Yea crowned with this Epinicion be, Great Babylon is fall'n, and that by Thee. THE Mock Mourners. A Satyr, By way of Elegy on King William. To the QUEEN. Such has been this Ill-Natur'd Nation's Fate, Always to see their Friends and Foes too late; By Native Pride, and want of Temper led, Never to value Merit till 'tis Dead: And then Immortal Monuments they raise, And damn their former Follies by their Praise; With just Reproaches rail at their own Vice, And mourn for those they did before despise: So they who Moses Government defi'd, Sincerely sorrow'd for him when he Di'd. And so when Britain's Genius fainting lay, Summon'd by Death, which Monarchs must obey; Trembling and Soul-less half the Nation stood, Upbraided by their own Ingratitude. They, who with true-born Honesty before, Grudg'd him the Trophies he so justly wore, Were, with his Fate, more than himself dismay'd, Not for their King, but for themselves afraid. He had their Rights and Liberties restor'd, In Battel purchas'd, and by Peace secur'd: And they with English Gratitude began To feel the Favour, and despise the Man. But when they saw that his Protection ceas'd, And Death had their Deliverer possest; How Thunderstruck they stood! What cries they rais'd! They look'd like Men distracted and amaz'd; Their Terror did their Conscious Guilt explain, And wish'd their injur'd Prince Alive again. They dream't of Halters, Gibbets, and of Jails, French Armies, Popery, and Prince of Wales, Descents, Invasions, Uproars in the State, Mobs, Irish Massacres, and God knows what: Imaginary Enemies appear'd, And all they knew they Merited, they Fear'd. 'Tis strange that Pride and Envy should prevail, To make Mens Sense as well as Vertue fail: That where they must depend they should abuse, And slight the Man they were afraid to lose. But William had not govern'd Fourteen Year, To be an unconcern'd Spectator here: His Works, like Providence, were all Compleat, Which made a Harmony we wonder'd at. The Legislative Power he set Free, And led them step by step to Liberty, 'Twas not his Fault if they cou'd not Agree. Impartial Justice He protected so, The Laws did in their Native Channels flow, From whence our sure Establishment begun, And William laid the first Foundation Stone, On which the stately Fabrick soon appear'd; How cou'd they sink when such a Pilot steer'd? He taught them due Defences to prepare, And make their future Peace their present care: By him directed, wisely they decreed, What Lines shou'd be expel'd, and what succeed; That now he's Dead, there's nothing to be done, But to take up the Scepter he laid down. The Circle of this Order is so round, So Regular as nothing can confound: In Truth and Justice all the Lines commence, And Reason is the vast Circumference: William's the moving Centre of the Whole, 'T had else a Body been without a Soul: Fenc'd with just Laws, impregnable it stands, And will for ever last in honest Hands; For Truth and Justice are th'Immortal Springs, Give Life to Constitutions and to Kings: In either Case, if one of these decay, These can no more command than those obey. Right is the only Fountain of Command, The Rock on which Authority must stand. And if Executive Power steps awry On either hand, it splits on Tyranny. Oppression is a Plague on Mankind sent, T'infect the Vitals of a Government. Convulsions follow, and such Vapours rise, The Constitution suffocates and dies. Law is the grand Specifick to restore, And unobstructed, never fails to cure: All other Remedies compar'd to that, Are tampering and quacking with the State. The Constitution's like a vast Machine, That's full of curious Workmanship within: Where tho the Parts unwieldy may appear, It may be put in motion with a Hair. The Wheels are Officers and Magistrates, By which the whole Contrivance operates: Laws are the Weights and Springs which make it move, Wound up by Kings as Managers above; And if they'r screw'd too high, or down too low, The Movement goes too fast, or else too slow. The Legislators are the Engineers, Who when 'tis out of Order make Repairs: The People are the Owners, 'twas for them The first Inventer drew the antient Scheme. 'Tis for their Benefit it works, and they The Charges of maintaining it defray: And if their Governours unfaithful prove, They, Engineers or Managers remove. Unkind Contention sometimes there appears Between the Managers and Engineers: Such Strife is always to the Owners wrong, And once it made the Work stand still too long; Till William came, and loos'd the Fatal Chain, And set the Engineers to work again: And having made the wondrous thing compleat, To Anne's unerring Hand he left the Helm of State. Anne, like Elisha, when Just William went, Receiv'd the Mantle of his Government: And by Divine Concession does inherit A Double Portion of his Ruling Spirit. The Dying Hero, loaded with Renown, Gave her the Nations Blessing with the Crown, From God, the People, and the Laws her own: Told her that he had Orders from on High, To lay aside the Government and Dye: What he had Fought for, gave her up in Peace, And chear'd her Royal Heart with Prospect of Success. While he, who Death in all its Shapes had seen, With full Composure, quiet and serene, Passive and undisorder'd at his Fate, Quitted the English Throne without Regret. No Conscious Guilt disturb'd his Royal Breast, Calm as the Region of Eternal Rest: Before his Life went out, his Heaven came in, For all was bright without and clear within. The blest Rewards did to his sight appear, The Passage easie, and the Prospect near; His parting Eye the gladsom Regions spy'd, Just so, before his Dear Maria Dy'd. His High concern for England he exprest, England, the Darling of his Royal Breast: The Transports of his parting Soul he spent, Her dis-united Parties to lament; His Wishes then supplied his want of Power, And Pray'd for them, for whom he Fought before. Speak Envy, if you can, inform us what Cou'd this unthankful Nation murmur at? But Discontent was always our Disease, For English-men what Government can please? We always had our Sons of Belial here, Who knew no God nor Government to fear: No wonder these dislik'd his Gentle Sway, Unwilling Homage to his Scepter pay, And only did for want of Power, obey. Some soft excuse for them we might contrive, Had he not been the Gentlest Prince Alive; Had he not born with an exalted Mind All that was disobliging and unkind. Peaceful and Tender Thoughts his Mind possest, And high Superior Love conceal'd the rest: Our Discontents wou'd oft his Pity move, But all his Anger was supprest by Love. That Heaven-born Passion had subdu'd his Soul, Possest the greatest part, and Rul'd the whole: This made him strive his People to possess, Which he had done, had he oblig'd them less. He knew that Titles are but empty things, And Hearts of Subjects are the Strength of Kings: Justice and Kindness were his constant care, He scorn'd to govern Mankind by their Fear. Their Universal Love he strove to gain, 'Twas hard that we should make him strive in vain: That he should here our English Humours find, And we, whom he had sav'd, shou'd be unkind. By all endearing stratagems he strove, To draw us by the secret springs of Love: And when he could not cure our Discontent, It always was below him to Resent. Nature was never seen in such excess, All Fury when Abroad, at Home all Peace: In War all Fire and Blood, in Peace enclin'd To all that's Sweet and Gentle, Soft and Kind. Ingratitude for this must needs commence In want of Honesty, or want of Sense. When Kings to Luxury and Ease resign'd, Their Native Countries just Defence declin'd; This High pretending Nation us'd to plead, What they'd perform had they a King to lead; What Wondrous Actions had by them been done, When they had Martial Monarchs to lead on; And if their Prince would but with France make War, What Troops of English Heroes wou'd appear. William the bottom of their Courage found, False like themselves, mere emptiness and sound: For call'd by Fate to fight for Christendom, They sent their King abroad, and stay'd themselves at home; Wisely declin'd the Hazards of the War, To nourish Faction and Disorders here. Wrapt in Luxurious plenty, they Debauch, And load their Active Monarch with Reproach; Backward in Deeds, but of their Censures free, And slight the Actions which they dare not see. At home they bravely teach him to Command, And judg of what they are afraid to mend: Against the Hand that saves them they exclaim, And curse the Strangers, tho they fight for them. Tho some who wou'd excuse the matter say, They did not grudg their Service; but their Pay. Where are the Royal Bands that now advance, To spread his dreadful Banners into France? Britannia's Noble Sons her Interest fly, And Foreign Heroes must their place supply; Much for the Fame of our Nobility. Posterity will be asham'd to hear, Great Britain's Monarch did in Arms appear, And scarce an English Nobleman was there. Our Ancestors had never conquer'd France, (For Kingdoms seldom are subdu'd by Chance) Had Talbot, Vere, and Montacute withheld The Glory, for the Danger of the Field. Had English Honesty been kept alive, The antient English Glory would survive; But Gallantry and Courage will decline, Where Pride and all Confederate Vices join. Had we kept up the fame of former Years, Landen had been as Famous as Poictiers. Ormond and Essex had not fought alone, The only English Lords our Verse can own: The only Peers of whom the World can say, That they for Honour fought, and not for Pay. A Regimented Few we had indeed, Who serv'd for neither Pride nor Fame, but Bread: Some Bully L?s, Protection P?s, and some Went out because they dare not stay at Home. Loaded with Noxious Vices they appear, A scandal to the Nation and the War; Heroes in Midnight scuffles with the Watch, And Lewd enough an Army to Debauch. Flesh'd with cold Murders, and from Justice fled, Pursu'd by Blood in drunken Quarrels shed: In vain they strive with Bravery to appear, For where there's Guilt, there always will be Fear. These are the Pillars of the English Fame, Such Peers as History must blush to name. When future Records to the World relate Marsaglia's Field, and Gallant Schomberg's Fate: W? was Captive made, it was severe, Fate took the Honest Man, and left the Peer. The World owes Fame for Ages long before, To the Great Stile of W? which he bore: But when we come the Branches to compare, 'Ts a Hero Ancestor, a Bully Heir: The Vertues the Posterity forsake, And all their Gallant Blood is dwindl'd to a Rake. More might be said, but Satyr stay thy Rhimes, And mix not his Misfortune with his Crimes: We need not rake the Ashes of the Dead, There's living Characters enough to read. How cou'd this Nation ever think of Peace? Or how look up to Heaven for Success? While lawless Vice in Fleets and Camps appear'd, And Oaths were louder than their Cannon heard: No wonder English Israel has been said Before the French Philistines Fleet t'ha' fled; While T? Embrac'd with Whores appear'd, And Vice it self the Royal Navy Steer'd. William oppos'd their Crimes with steddy hand, By his Example first, and then Command; Prompted the Laws their Vices to suppress, For which no doubt the Guilty lov'd him less. Ye Sons of Envy, Railers at the Times, Be bold like English-Men and own your Crimes: For shame put on no black, but let us see Your Habits always, and your Tongues agree. Envy ne'er blushes, Let it not be said, You Hate him Living, and you Mourn him Dead: No Sorrow show where you no Love profess, There are no Hypocrites in Wickedness. Great Bonfires make, and tell the World y' are glad Y' have lost the greatest Blessing e'er you had. So Mad-men sing in Nakedness and Chains, For when the Sense is gone, the Song remains. So Thankless Israel, when they were set free, Reproach'd the Author of their Liberty, And wish'd themselves in Egypt back again: What Pity 'twas they wish'd, or wish'd in vain? Stop Satyr, let Britannia now relate Her William's Character, and her own Fate; Let her to him a grateful Trophy raise, She best can sigh his Loss that best could sing his Praise. BRITANNIA. Of all my Sons by Tyranny bereft, A Widow desolate and Childless left, By Violence and Injury opprest, To Heaven I cast my Eyes, and sigh'd the rest. I need but sigh, for I was always heard, And William on my welcome Shores appear'd. With Wings of speed to rescue me he came, And all my Sorrows vanish'd into Flame. New Joys sprung up, new Triumphs now abound, And all my Virgin Daughters hear the Sound: Eternal Dances move upon my Plains, And Youthful Blood springs in my antient Veins. With open Arms I yielded my Embrace, And William saw the Beauties of my Face. He had before the knowledge of my Charms, For he had my Maria in his Arms. While he remain'd, I gave eternal Spring, Made him my Son, my Darling, and my King; While all the wondring World my Choice approve, Congratulate his Fate, and justify my Love. Of British Blood in Belgian Plains he liv'd, My only Foreign Off-spring that surviv'd. Batavian Climates nourish'd him a while, Too great a Genius for so damp a Soil: And freely then surrendred him to me, For wise Men freely will the Fates obey. Yet in my William they had equal Share, And he defended them with equal Care. They were the early Trophies of his Sword, His Infant Hand their Liberty restor'd. His Nurse, that Belgick Lion, roar'd for Aid, And planted early Lawrels on his Head. His easy Victories amaz'd Mankind; We wonder'd what the dreadful Youth design'd. Fearless he fought his Country to set free, And with his Sword cut out their Liberty. The Journals of his Actions always seem'd So wonderful, as if the World had dream'd: So swift, so full of Terrour he went on, He was a Conquerour before a Man. The Bourbon Sword, tho it was brighter far, Yet drawn for Conquest, and oppressive War, Had all the Triumphs of the World engrost, But quickly all those Triumphs to him lost. Justice to William early Trophies brought; William for Truth and Justice always fought. He was the very Mystery of War, He gain'd by't when he was not Conquerour. And if his Enemies a Battel won, He might be beaten, they would be undone. Antæus like from every fall he rose, Strengthen'd with double Vigour to oppose; Those Actions Mankind judg'd Unfortunate, Serv'd but as secret Steps to make him Great. Then let them boast their Glory at Landen, In vain th'Embattl'd Squadrons crowded in, Theirs was the Victory, the Conquest mine. Of all the Heroes Ages past adore, Back to the first Great Man, and long before; Tho Virtue has sometimes with Valour join'd, The Barren World no Parallel can find. If back to Israel's Tents I shou'd retire, And of the Hebrew Heroes there enquire, I find no Hand did Judah's Scepter wear, Comes up to William's Modern Character. Namure's Gygantick Towers he o'erthrew; David did less when he Goliah slew. Here's no Uriah's for Adult'ry slain, Nor Oaths forgot to faithful Jonathan. And if to Jesse's Grandson we've recourse, William his Wisdom had without his Whores. Joshua might still have staid on Jordan Shore, Must he, as William did the Boyne, pass o'er. Almighty Power was forc'd to interpose, And frighted both the Water and his Foes: But had my William been to pass that Stream, God needed not to part the Waves for him. Not Forty Thousand Canaanites cou'd stand, In spight of Waves or Canaanites he'd land: Such Streams ne'er stemm'd his Tide of Victory; No, not the Stream; no, nor the Enemy. His Bombs and Cannon wou'd ha' made the Wall, Without the Help of Jewish Rams-Horns, fall. When his dear Israel from their Foes had fled, Because of stoln Spoils by Achan hid; He'd ne'er, like Joshua, on the Ground ha' laid, He'd certainly ha' fought as well as pray'd. The Sun would rather ha' been thought to stay, Amaz'd to see how soon he'ad won the Day, Than to give time the Canaanites to slay. The greatest Captains of the Ages past, Debauch'd their Fame with Cruelty at last: William did only Tyrants subdue; These conquer'd Kings, and then the People too: The Subjects reap'd no Profit for their Pains, And only chang'd their Masters, not their Chains; Their Victories did for themselves appear, And made their Peace as dreadful as the War: But William fought Oppression to destroy, That Mankind might in Peace the World enjoy. The Pompeys, Cæsars, Scipio's, Alexanders, Who crowd the World with Fame, were great Commanders. These too brought Blood and Ruin with their Arms, But William always fought on other Terms. Terrour indeed might in his Front appear, But Peace and Plenty follow'd in his Rear: And if Oppression forc'd him to contend, Calmness was all his Temper, Peace his End: He was the only Man we e'er saw fit To regulate the World or conquer it. Who can his Skill in Government gainsay, He that can England's brittle Scepter sway, Where Parties too much rule, and Kings obey? He always reign'd by Gentleness and Love, An Emblem of the Government above. Vote me not Childless then in Christendom, I yet have Sons in my suspended Womb: And till just Fate such due Provision makes, A Daughter my Protection undertakes. Crowns know no Sexes, and my Government To either Kind admits a just Descent. Queens have to me been always fortunate, E'er since my English Phœnix rul'd the State; Who made my People rich, my Country great. Satyr be just, and when we lash their Crimes, Mingle some Tears for William with our Rhimes. Tho Baseness and Ingratitude appear, Thank Heaven that we ha' weeping Millions here: Then speak our hearty Sorrows if you can, Superior Grief in feeling Words explain: Accents that wound, and all the Senses numb, And while they speak may strike the Hearer dumb: Such Grief as never was for King before, And such as never, never shall be more. See how Authority comes weeping on, And view the Queen lamenting on his Throne. With just Regret she takes the Sword of State, Not by her Choice directed, but his Fate; Accepts the sad Necessity with Tears, And mournfully for Government prepares. The Peoples Acclamations she receives With sadn'd Joy, and a Content that grieves. View next the sad Assemblies that appear, To tell their Grief for him, and Joy for her. The first confounds the last with such Excess, They hardly can their noble Thoughts express. The Illustrious Troop address her to condole, And speak such Grief as wounds her to the Soul: They lodg their Sorrows in the Royal Breast, The Harbour where the Nation looks for Rest. Next these, the Representatives arise, With all the Nations Sorrow in their Eyes. The Epithets they righteously apply To the Restorer of their Liberty, Are Tokens of their Sense and Honesty. For as a Body we were always true, But 'tis our Parties that our Peace undo. Who can like them the Peoples Grief express? They shew her all the Tokens of Excess: O'erwhelm'd with Sorrow, and supprest with Care, They place the Nation's Refuge now in her: Nothing but her Succession cou'd abate The Nation's Sorrow for their Monarch's Fate: And nothing but his Fate cou'd their true Joy For her Succession lessen or destroy. The Civil Sword to her, as Heaven saw fit, With general Satisfaction they commit: How can it in a Hand like hers miscarry? But who shall for us weild the Military? Who shall the jarring Generals unite; First teach them to agree, and then to fight? Who shall renew'd Alliances contrive, And keep the vast Confederacies alive? Who shall the growing Gallick Force subdue? 'Twas more than all the World, but him, cou'd do. Sighs for departed Friends are sensless things, But 'tis not so when Nations mourn for Kings: When wounded Kingdoms such a Loss complain, As Nature never can repair again; The Tyrant Grief, like Love, obeys no Laws, But blindly views th'Effect, and not the Cause. Dark are the Works of Sovereign Providence, And often clash with our contracted Sense: But if we might with Heaven's Decrees debate, And of our Maker's Works expostulate; Why shou'd he form a Mind supremely great, And to his Charge commit the Reins of Fate, And at one hasty Blow the Work defeat? A Blow so sudden, so severe and swift, We had no time for Supplication left: As if Almighty Power had been afraid, Such Pray'rs wou'd by such Multitudes be made; Such Moses's wou'd to his Altars go, To whom he never did, or wou'd say no; He hardly cou'd know how to strike the Blow. For Prayer so much the Sovereign Power commands, Ev'n God himself sometimes as conquer'd stands, And calls for Quarter at the Wrestler's Hands. How strenuous then had been the Sacred Strife, While all the kneeling World had begg'd his Life, With all that Earnestness of Zeal, and more Than ever Nation begg'd for King before? See how the neighbouring Lands his Fame improve, And by their Sorrows testify their Love; Sprinkle his Memory with grateful Tears, And hand his Glory to succeeding Years. With what Contempt will English Men appear, When future Ages read his Character? They'll never bear to hear in time to come, How he was lov'd abroad, and scorn'd at home. The World will scarce believe it cou'd be true, And Vengeance must such Insolence pursue. Our Nation will by all Men be abhor'd, And William's juster Fame be so restor'd. Posterity, when Histories relate His Glorious Deeds, will ask, What Giant's that? For common Vertues may Mens Fame advance, But an immoderate Glory turns Romance. Its real Merit does it self undo, Men talk it up so high, it can't be true: So William's Life, encreas'd by doubling Fame, Will drown his Actions to preserve his Name. The Annals of his Conduct they'll revise, As Legends of Impossibilities. 'Twill all a Life of Miracles appear, Too great for Him to do, or Them to hear. And if some faithful Writer shou'd set down With what uneasiness he wore the Crown; What thankless Devil had the Land possest; This will be more prodigious than the rest. With Indignation 'twill their Minds inspire, And raise the Glory of his Actions higher. The Records of their Fathers they'll deface, And blush to think they sprung from such a Race. They'll be asham'd their Ancestors to own, And strive their Fathers Follies to atone. New Monuments of Gratitude they'll raise, And Crown his Memory with Thanks and Praise. Thou, Satyr, shalt the grateful Few rehearse, And solve the Nation's Credit in thy Verse; Embalm his Name with Characters of Praise, His Fame's beyond the Power of Time to rase. From him let future Monarchs learn to Rule, And make his lasting Character their School. For he who wou'd in time to come be Great, His nothing now to do but Imitate. Let dying Parents when they come to bless, Wish to their Children only his Success. Here their Instructions very well may end, William's Example only recommend, And leave the Youth his History to attend. But we have here an Ignominious Croud, That boast their Native Birth and English Blood, Whose Breasts with Envy and Contention burn, And now rejoice when all the Nations mourn: Their aukward Triumphs openly they sing; Insult the Ashes of their injur'd King: Rejoice at the Disasters of his Crown, And drink the Horse's Health that threw him down. Blush, Satyr, when such Crimes we must reveal, And draw a silent Curtain to conceal. Actions so vile shall ne'er debauch our Song; Let Heaven alone: tho Justice suffers long, Her Leaden Wings, and Iron Hands, may show That she is certain, tho she may be slow. His Foreign Birth was made the Fam'd Pretence, Which gave our Home-born Englishmen Offence. But Discontent's the antient English Fashion, The Universal Blemish of the Nation. And 'tis a Question, whether God cou'd make That King whom every Englishman wou'd like? Nor is it any Paradox to say, William had more of English Blood than they; The Royal Life flow'd in his sprightly Veins, The same that in the Noble Stock remains; The same which now his Glorious Scepter weilds, To whom Three Nations Just Obedience yields. ANNE, the remaining Glory of our Isle, Well she becomes the Royal English Stile: In William's Steps sedately she proceeds, William's a Pattern to Immortal Deeds. Preserves his Memory with generous Care; Forgetting him is disobliging her; Where shall the murmuring Party then appear! Where wou'd the Nation, but for her, ha' found So safe a Cure for such a sudden Wound? And cou'd she but as well the Camp supply, The World the sooner wou'd their Grief lay by: But there the Fatal Breach is made so wide, That Loss can never, never be supply'd. Ye Men of Arms, and English Sons of War, Now learn from him how you may fight for her; Your Grief for him express upon her Foes, For William lov'd such Funeral Tears as those. 'Tis William's Glorious Scepter which she bears, Like William she for Liberty appears. She mounts to Honour by the Steps of Truth, And his Example imitates in Both. 'Tis you must make her blooming Fame increase, 'Tis you must bring her Honour, Wealth and Peace; And let it once more to the World be seen, Nothing can make us Greater than a Queen. The Whim, Dedicated to two Kings, that of Madrid and that of St. Germains. Midst pretty Tricks, and quaint Device Of tiny Child when void of Vice; (When Soul, that Particle Divine, Does but like Farthing-Candle shine: While Maid does hold the silly Taper, Enwrap'd in Lanthorn made of Paper, Which too but just Discernment brings, Nor shews the Difference of things. So glimmers the young dawning Soul Of Nature's pretty little Fool: Therefore, as Cassocks say, 'tis thought Whate'er it does can be no Fault) I say, midst Pleasantries of Child, Little Machines, and Actions wild; Of Cards I've seen the Bauble take A Superannuated Pack; The Diamond's sully'd, and the Spade By often use now dirty made; And only fit to entertain Pretty Conceit of Infant Brain. VVhich yet is scarce come into Scull, Not half so much as Sawcer full. VVhen Card by Card the Oaf does take, Father, look here what I can make! And then to work he strait does fall, To frame some small Escurial, Some Minor Pauls, or tiny Coloss, (But O the dismal Fate that follows!) First then he for Foundation lays A Row of Kings, a Royal Race. By them the Sex that's fair and tender, Their Spouses of the Feminine Gender. (The Queen of Hearts the brightest shone) And now the Edifice goes on: The Mob with Clubs and Spades are laid, Those dy'd the others into Red: But highest of all a Pack of Knaves, The Babe too naturally heaves, Just as in Fortune's Scale we see, Rogues mounted to Supremacy. There many Pams win all, each takes The Coin, and sweeps away the Stakes. Well now the Structure rises, and In gay sublimity does stand, Emblem of Artificial Hand. But Fates! When just at the Roof, Behind comes a malicious Puff, And down the Gugaw Pile does fall, As future Paul's e'er Dooms-day shall. E'en so (with small Things great compare) Lewis the Proud is nought but Air: With those that form'd his Grand Design, So close, so exquisitely fine, Richliess the Leader, Mazarine, Louvois and Croissy, and Fourbin. None with the nicest Subtlety, Could ought that was mislaid decry, Yet all their mighty Projects die. 'Twas, tho a fine, yet airy Web, The Torrent now begins to ebb, And now the Louvre, and Versailes, Th'Escurial too, that Spanish Paul's, Shake at great Eugene's Name and Sword, Who's sending 'em another Lord: Who's like to puff that Babel down; The little Boy that wears the Crown, With his Grand Pa-Pa are pushing on. But see the Spanish Phaeton, That dwells i'th Regions of the Sun, Has got his Leave of Gallic Sire, To go and set the World on fire. Well, drive on Coachman, and take care, To set down, not bring back your Fare: The Don Monsieur, the Spanish Beau, When he comes near the fatal Po, May curse old Dady's Allez vous. On the Descent of the Germans from the Alps to Verona, and their Ascent from the Aqueduct into Cremona. From parting Clouds, the German Eagle brings Vindictive Thunder on Imperial VVings. The Gallick VVarrior from beneath descries VVith wonder, while o'er Alps and Rocks he flies, And levels at him from the neighb'ring Skies. But see arm'd Numbers, rising from below! Cremona trembles while the Germans flow, From opening Cavern on th'astonish'd Foe. Believe me, France, your Lilly faintly grows; Nature ne'er fram'd it for th'Italian Snows; 'Twill never thrive, since Heaven and Earth oppose. A Prologue design'd for Tamerlane, but never spoke. Written by Dr. G??th. To day a mighty Hero comes to warm Your curdling Blood, and bid you, Britains, arm. To Valour much he owes, to Vertue more; He fights to save, and conquers to restore. He strains no Texts, nor makes Dragoons perswade; He likes Religion, but he hates the Trade. Born for Mankind, they by his Labours live; Their Property is his Prerogative. His Sword destroys less than his Mercy saves, And none, except his Passions, are his Slaves. Such, Britains, is the Prince that you possess, In Council greatest, and in Camps no less: Brave, but not Cruel; VVise without Deceit; Born for an Age curs'd with a Bajazet. But you, disdaining to be too secure, Ask his Protection, and yet grudg his Power. VVith you a Monarch's Right is in dispute; VVho give Supplies, are only Absolute. Britain, for shame your factious Feuds decline, Too long you've labour'd for the Bourbon Line: Assert lost Rights, an Austrian Prince alone Is born to nod upon a Spanish Throne. A Cause no less cou'd on Great Eugene call, Steep Alpine Rocks require an Hannibal: He shows you your lost Honour to retrieve; Our Troops will fight, when once the Senate give. Quit your Cabals and Factions, and in spite Of Whig and Tory in this Cause unite. One Vote will then send Anjou back to France, There let the Meteor end his airy Dance: Else to the Mantuan Soil he may repair, (E'en Abdicated Gods were Latium's Care) At worst, he'll find some Cornish Borough here. To the French King. See, thou Disturber of the World's Repose, Your rotting Brother warns you of your Close. Your British Friend too moulders in his Tomb, And wasted Armies call you to your Doom. VVhat Shoals of Gallick Ghosts from Eugene's Sword, (Eugene, by whom our dying Hope's restor'd) Fled thro th'Italian Air, and curs'd their Lord? But you must go, the Leveller of Kings Draws nigh Versailes, and the late Summons brings: While Worms, unkinder than your Maintenon, Wait for that Head swell'd with a double Crown; Impatiently expect the destin'd Skull Of Schemes and Thrones, and injur'd Treaties full. Methinks I see 'em revel in his Brain, Where midnight Projects of dire Conclaves reign; Mazes of Mischiefs to involve the Earth In Blood and Woe, which thence derive their Birth. Methinks I see 'em skirmish for Le Grand, Each Royal Vein's by eager Reptiles drain'd, Confus'dly roving, like his Soldiers Flight Thro their Cremona in the German Night. But O! This Scene creates a Sacred Awe, Makes the Muse tremble, while she strives to draw Our Nature levell'd to that dreaded Law. But if that Grand Destroyer would make haste, And spight of Fagon, make him breath his last, The World from thence would find a time to breath, That's only hop'd for from that Stroke of Death. Nations would thank him for that grateful Blow, And rescu'd Armies with their Standards bow: The British, Belgic, Neapolitan, The German, Spaniard, and the Mantuan. Cou'd we but see him safe within his Tomb, And France in Mourning for their Monarch's Doom, The Sight would please beyond the Pomp of Rome: While Groves of Cypress, and the Baneful Yew Europe would send, its Sentiments to shew, And heap 'em on him for a Grand Adieu. On King William. How long must the Restorer of our State, That Royal Engine of designing Fate, Toil, the Concerns of Heaven to compleat? In whose close Breast their Councils brood secure, And Europe's Welfare waits the mighty Hour; Where Lewis Ruin yet in Embryo lies, And whence kind Peace intends her sacred Rise. Th'alluring Dictates of soft Ease he slights, With Jove in Flame and Thunder he delights. The Dooms of Nations He and Fate dispose, The One decrees but what the Other does. His Arms the Briny Empire late maintain'd, And British Waves with French Dishonour stain. 'Tis true, yet Conquest holds the question'd Ball, As loth to let the mighty Laurel fall; Yet certain to adorn the English Brow, Proceeds in Blood before she does bestow, Like Heaven and Fate in great Donations slow. This won, then NASSAU, readorn your Crown, Can you forgo MARIA for Renown? So keen for Fame? Awhile the World delay, After a Pause in Albion's Arms, convey Your Sword as far as the Retreat of Day. With British Shields affright the Eastern Moon, And rob the Indians of their God the Sun. Methinks I see already on the Loom Revolving Years of the Third Edward come. I see the Martial'd Britains in a Line, In English Helmets quaff the conquer'd Seine, While William's Health goes round in tributary Wine. I see his Pow'r thro the won Realm diffuse, Now Gallia yields, and Boileau damns his Muse. He now on Lewis pleads an Irony, To you, NASSAU, the transfer'd Praises fly. No trivial Statue shall thy Fame suffice, VVe'll raise Colossi to th'endanger'd Skies, And shew the Gods how Nassau's Vertues rise: Beyond where'er the Roman Eagles flew, A Pitch the lingring Cæsars never knew. Bless'd be the Day when the long forming Years Disclos'd the Hero to the wond'ring Spheres; VVhen first the Ocean knew its Infant Lord, The Albion Genius shook, the Belgic Lions roar'd. Europe took notice of the mighty Throw, And Rev'rend Nature did with Homage bow. So fares the VVorld when a NASSAU appears, NASSAU! the noblest Favour of the Stars. Nor a less Triumph signaliz'd the Time VVhen first MARIA grac'd the English Clime. Fair at her Birth the Royal Beauty shone; As when the President of Light, the Sun, VVith Infant Lustre, and with new-born Ray, Had shook off Chaos, and began the Day. The Conscious Planets join'd the mighty Pair, Decreed by Fate the parted Globe to share. VVisely the Gods, for Virtues like their own, Preventing Censure did provide a Throne; The Justice equal, and the Plea's the same, As they their Altars, these their Scepters claim. Yet what a Loss of Power had each sustain'd, Had distant MARY from her WILLIAM reign'd? Less had their Grandeur, less their Empire grown, He'd wanted th'English, she the Gallick Crown. So two fair Planets that adorn the Sphere, VVith a less Splendor, if apart, appear: But when their dazling Glories kindly join, VVith fiercer Vigour, greater State they shine. Nor can their native Bounds their Rays contain, But o'er the subject World with mingl'd Beams they reign. The Ghost of K. C?????ll. Written about the Year 1692. As in a Dream our thinking Monarch lay, E'er Night gave place to the approaching Day, A Ghastly Phantom at his Pillow reer'd, And with wide Mouth, broad Eyes, thin Cheeks appear'd; Which in a Flash of Lightning crown'd with Smoke, Thus his Bat?an Successor bespoke. Hail my blest Nephew, whom the Fates ordain To fill the Measure of the St?rts Reign; That all the Ills by our whole Race design'd, In thee their full Accomplishment might find: 'Tis thou that art decreed this Point to clear, Which we have labour'd for these fourscore Year: Lest then thou fail'st in this high Enterprize, I'm come to steel thee with my best Advice. First cast all idle Thoughts of Heaven away, Those pious Clogs to Arbitrary Sway, Which serve to sink a Subject to a Slave, But must not check the Actions of the Brave. Kings are free Agents, and their Wills are Laws, Which they may break or keep as they see cause, And claim a Share in the Almighty Power Which Heaven assumes, to nourish or devour. And when thy Fear of God abates its Force, Thy Gratitude to Man will fail of course: And these must be subdu'd e'er thou obtain The pleasing Fruits of Arbitrary Reign. Yet still the Church must be thy chiefest Care, For Kings (you know) their nursing Fathers are: That Set of Blockheads are the Monarch's Tools, To keep the Knaves in awe, and banter Fools. Keep them but under, Spaniel-like, and tame, They'l be of use to point thee out thy Game; Make 'em believe thou'rt theirs, but trust them not, More than to serve thy Lust, or hunt a Plot. If thy dull Father had these Measures ta'en, Thy Attempt to th'English Throne had been in vain. Next, let thy Ministers consist of those Who either are thy own or England's Foes: Take them of Men impeach'd of former Crimes, Or else obnoxious to the present Times. Such as thy Father rais'd, and him betray'd, Must be the Objects of thy Favour made; Or that oppos'd thy coming to the Throne, Take these into thy Bosom, they're thy own: While such as have thy Int'rest truly serv'd, May thank their own Estates they are not starv'd. Avoid the Wise and Honest all you can, For Monarchy will bear no Virtuous Man. In all Employs be careful to select Those that will give from those that do expect: Mankind's alike, Distinction's hard to make; The Mony then must guide you whom to take. Another piece of Kingly Craft occurs, Which is to manage right Intestine Stirs. Of this I will but one short instance give, To shew you how this Nail of State to drive. A Race of Men, unknown in former Story, Had split this Kingdom into Whig and Tory; Both Factions grew in Country and in Court, And both to me did mutually resort; To whom I gave a subalternate Power T'enable them each other to devour. This Artifice of State, had I liv'd on, Would in short time have fix'd the Imperial Throne: But when I fell, that Abdicated Goose, Thy Father, left the Game at fast and loose; And vent'ring to pluck off the Mask too soon, United them, and was himself undone. This Game revive again, pursue it close, And thou the Fate of England may'st dispose. Lastly, to crown the Work, keep fair and even With the Enchanted Chappel of St. Stephen; That Politick Ware-house, whence a King may draw Fit Tools to overturn both Right and Law. Fail not to bait the Trap, these Gulls to please With Hopes of Pensions, Gifts, and Offices: Keep there the Poison strong, supply the Spring With fresh Corruptions, and be ever King. More might be said, but I am call'd away By a shrill Voice which ushers in the Day; Speak quickly, if thou'ast any thing to say. The Pensive Prince, not given to Replies, Upon his Bed a while revolving lies; Then starting up, to's Cabinet he went, And shew'd the Ghost his Scheme of Government: Which when he'ad seen, away the Goblin spun, Frighted to see himself so much out done. The Mourners: Found in the Streets, 1702. The attribution of this poem is questionable. In Sable Weeds your Beaux and Bells appear, And cloud the coming Beauties of the Year. Mourn on, you foolish fashionable things, Mourn for your own Misfortunes, not the King's; Mourn for the mighty Mass of Coin mis-spent, That prodigally given, and idly spent; Mourn your Tapestry and Statutes too, And Windsor gutted, to adorn your Loo; Mourn for the Miter long from Scotland gone, And much more mourn your Union coming on; Mourn for a ten Years War, and dismal Weather, And Taxes, strung like Necklaces together, On Salt, Malt, Paper, Syder, Lights and Leather. Much for the Civil List need not be said, They truly mourn who're fifteen Months unpaid. Well then, my Friends, since things you see are so, Let's e'en mourn on, 'twould lessen much our Wo, Had Sorrel stumbled thirteen Years ago. The Counterpart. Ye English Nations, put your Mourning on; Mourn not the King's Misfortune, but your own. For Realms of Light and of Eternal Day He lately chang'd his Temporary Sway, And left you blundring in the tractless Way. He was the Star by which all Europe steer'd, The Compass shew'd us how its Councils veer'd. When e'er you are on raging Billows tost, Think of the skilful Pilot you have lost; Think on the Dangers he did for you prove, The Storms and Thunder of Almighty Jove: How midst fork'd Lightning, show'rs of Shot and Blood, Divinely bold our Mighty William stood, Not for his own, but for our Country's Good. Our Native Land was not his only Care, Nations far distant did his Bounty share; The Rhine, the Tiber, Ganges, with their Streams, Do mourn in Consort with our groaning Thames. On Sir John Fenwick. The attribution of this poem is questionable. 1 Here lie the Relicks of a martyr'd Knight, Whose Loyalty unspotted as the Light, Seal'd with his Blood his injur'd So?gn's Right. 2 The State his Head did from his Body sever, Because when living 'twas his chief Endeavour To set the Nation and its Head together. 3 He boldly fell, girt round with weeping Soldiers, Imploring Heaven for the good o' the Beholders, So to cut H?d's Head from England's Shoulders. An Allusion to the 7th Epode of Horace, 1690. Quo, quo Scelesti ruitis, &amp;c. 1. Whither, ye impious Britons, do ye run, As if already not enough undone? Your Sea has oft run Purple to the Shore, And Flanders is manur'd with English Gore; Yet still you arm, and still prepare to fight Against your K?, his Country, and his Right. 2. If you must arm, unite the British Powers, Destroy your Rival Holland's lofty Towers, And be her Ruin as she has been yours. Holland deserv'd to be this Nation's Curse, Bad as a Foe, but as a Friend much worse: See the Batavians with a grinning Pride Your present Ills and future Hopes deride. 3. And well they may, for they can only boast, Because your Credit, Wealth, and Traffick's lost; Theirs is the Gain, and they may triumph most. Pleas'd with a selfish, dull, malicious Joy, To see your selves none but your selves destroy; 'Tis obvious, but infatuated you Still court your Ruin, and contrive it too. 4. Tell me, Is't Madness this, or Hopes of Gain, Or do the Sons the Fathers Crimes sustain? Why are you pale and speechless? Why appears This Trembling? and why flow these guilty Tears? Since there's a Cause, a monstrous Cause indeed, You fain wou'd hide, too horrid to be hid. 5. Yes, Britons, yes, you groan beneath the Weight Of Charles the Martyr's undeserved Fate; Too well you know his unrepented Fall Entails this Curse, and will confound you all. On S?????l. The attribution of this poem is questionable. Illustrious Steed, who should the Zodiack grace, To thee the Lion and the Bull give place: Blest be the Dam that fed thee, blest the Earth, Which first receiv'd thee, and first gave thee Birth. Did wrong'd Hibernia to revenge her Slain Produce thee, or else murder'd Fenwick's Strain, Or barbarously massacred Glencoes Clan? Whence e'er thou art, be thou for ever blest, And spend the Remnant of thy Days in rest; No servile Use thy Noble Limbs profane, No Weight thy Back, no Curb thy Mouth restrain; No more be thou, no more Mankind a Slave, But both enjoy that Liberty you gave. A Song, 1696. [Last Year in the Spring, the Life of the King] The attribution of this poem is questionable. 1 Last Year in the Spring, the Life of the King Was intended by Assassination; But now they'll pull down the Life of the Kingdom By a cursed Capitation. 2 France and En?d combin'd, and were plainly join'd Thus singly his Death to procure; But En?d alone does to all the World own, That none but her self shall undo her. 3 When a Nation submits to be govern'd by Chits, If you look for wise Acts you're mistaken; Since the P?t-House is rul'd by a Mouse, Who the Devil can save his Bacon? 4 New Projects they advance, to serve as in France; But can France have more equal, Sir? If Affairs must be done, I think 'tis all one Into what Lion's Paws we fall, Sir. 5 O J?s, were thy Party as wise as they're hearty, And thou thy self fit to be trusted; What a blessed Occasion is this Capitation For matters to be adjusted? 6 But since thou art he whom we took thee to be, Neither Age nor Experience has mended; Let us look but once more to some foreign Shore For a Prince that never offended. The House of NASSAU. A Pindarick Ode. I. Goddess of Numbers, and of Thoughts sublime! Celestial Muse! whose charming Song Can fix Heroick Acts, that glide along Down the vast Sea of perishing Time, And all the gilded Images can stay Till Time's vast Sea it self be roll'd away: O now assist with consecrated Strains! Let Art and Nature join to raise A living Monument of Praise O'er William's Great Remains. While Thames majestically sad, and slow, Seems by that Reverend Dome to flow, Which new-inter'd his Sacred Urn contains. If thou, O Muse, wou'dst e'er Immortal be, This Song bequeaths thee Immortality; For William's Praise can ne'er expire, Tho Nature's Self at last must die, And all this fair erected Sky Must sink, with Earth and Sea, and melt away in Fire. II. Begin—the Spring of Vertue trace, That, from afar descending, flow'd Thro the rich Veins of all the Godlike Race, And fair Renown on all the Godlike Race bestow'd. This Antient Source of Noble Blood Thro thee, Germania, wandring wide, Like thy own Rhine's enriching Tide, In num'rous Branches long diffus'd its Flood. Rhine, scarce more antient, never grac'd thee more, Tho mantling Vines his comely Head surround, And all along his Sunny Shore Eternal Plenty's found. III. From Heaven it self th'Illustrious Line began; Ten Ages in Descent it ran, In each Descent encreas'd with Honours new. Never did Heaven's Supreme inspire In mortal Breasts a nobler Fire, Nor his own Image livelier drew. Of pure Ætherial Flame their Souls he made; And as beneath his forming Hands they grew, He bless'd the Master-Work, and said, Go forth, my honour'd Champions, go To vindicate my Cause below! Awful in Pow'r, defend for Me Religion, Justice, Liberty, And at Aspiring Tyranny My Delegated Thunder throw! For this the Great Nassovian Name I raise, And still this Character Divine Distinguish'd thro the Race shall shine, Zeal for their Country's Good, and Thirst of Virtuous Praise. IV. Now look, Britannia, look and see Thro the clear Glass of History, From whom thy mighty Sov'reign came, And take a large Review of far-extended Fame. See, Crouds of Heroes rise to Sight! ADOLPHUS Adolphus, the Emperor, of the House of Nassau., with Imperial Splendor gay. Brave PHILIBERT, unmatch'd in Fight, Who led the German Eagle to his Prey; Thro Lombardy he mark'd his conquer'd Way, And made proud Rome and Naples own his unresisted Might. His gallant Renè of Nassau. Nephew next appears, And on his Brows the Wreaths of Conquest wears. Tho streaming Wounds the martial Finger stain, For thee, Great Charles 5th. Charles, in Battel slain, Slain in all a Soldier's Pride, He fell triumphant by thy side, And falling fought, and fighting dy'd, And lay, a manly Corps, extended on the Plain. V. See next, Majestically Great, The Founder of the Belgick State! The Sun of Glory which so bright Beam'd on all the Darling Line, Did from its golden Urn of Light On WILLIAM's Head redoubled shine. His youthful Looks diffus'd an Awe; Charles, who had try'd the Race before, And knew great Merits to explore, When he this rising Vertue saw, He put in Friendship's Noble Claim; To his Imperial Court the Hero brought, And there by early Honours sought Alliance with his future Fame. O generous Sympathy, that binds In Chains unseen the Bravest Minds! O Love to worthy Deeds, in all great Souls the same! VI. But Time at last brought forth th'amazing Day, When Charles resolv'd to disingage From Empire's Toils his weary Age, Gave with each Hand a Crown away. Philip, his haughty Son, afraid Of William's Vertues, basely chose His Father's Favorite to depose; His Tyrant Reign requir'd far other Aid, And Alva's fiery Duke, his Scourge of Vengeance, rose; With Flames of Inquisition rose from Hell, Of Slaughter proud, and insolent in Blood. What Hand can paint the Scenes of tragic Woes? What Tongue, sad Belgia, can thy Story tell, When with her lifted Ax proud Murder stood, And thy Brave Sons in Crouds unnumber'd fell? The Sun, with Horror of the Sight, Withdraws his sickly Beams, and shrouds His muffl'd Face in sullen Clouds, And on the Scaffolds faintly sheds a pale malignant Light. VII. Thus Belgia's Liberty expiring lay, And almost gasp'd her gen'rous Life away, Till ORANGE hears her moving Cries; He hears, and marching He was then in Germany. from afar, Brings to her Aid the sprightly War. At his Approach, reviv'd with fresh Supplies Of gather'd Strength, she on her Murd'rers flies. But Heaven, at first, resolv'd to try By Proofs adverse his Constancy. Four Armies lost, The Counts Lodowick and Henry. two Gallant Brothers slain, Will he the desperate War maintain? Tho rolling Tempests darken all the Sky, And Thunder breaks around his Head, Will he again the faithless Sea explore, And oft driv'n back, still quit the Shore? He will—his Soul, averse to Dread, Unweary'd still the Spight of Fortune braves, Superior, and Savis tranquillus in undis, The Prince his Motto. Serene amidst the Stormy Waves. VIII. Such was the Man, so vast his Mind! The steddy Instrument of Fate To fix the Basis of a rising State. My Muse with Horror views the Scene behind, And fain would draw a Shade, and fain Wou'd hide his destin'd End, nor tell How he—the dreaded Foe of Spain, More fear'd than Thousands on the Plain, By the vile Hand of a bold Ruffian fell. No more—th'ungrateful Prospect let us leave! And in his Room behold arise, Bright as th'Immortal Twins that grace the Skies, A Noble Maurice and Henry. Pair his Absence to retrieve! In these the Hero's Soul survives, And William doubly in his Offspring lives. IX. MAURICE, for Martial Greatness, far His Father's Glorious Fame exceeds: HENRY alone can match his Brother's Deeds; Both were, like Scipio's Sons, the Thunderbolts of War. None e'er than Maurice better knew Camps, Sieges, Battels to ordain; None e'er than Henry fiercer did pursue The flying Foe, or earlier Conquests gain: For scarce Sixteen revolving Years he told, When eager for the Fight, and Bold, Enflam'd by Glory's sprightly Charms, His Brother brought him to the Field; Taught his young Hand the Truncheon well to weild, And practis'd him betimes to Arms. X. Let Flandrian Newport tell of Wonders wrought Before her Walls, that memorable Day, When the Victorious Youths in Concert fought, And matchless Valour did display! How, e'er the Battel join'd, they strove With emulous Honour, and with mutual Love; How Maurice, touch'd with tender Care Of Henry's Safety, beg'd him to remove; Henry refus'd his blooming Youth to spare, But with his much-lov'd Maurice vow'd to prove Th'Extremes of War, and equal Dangers share. O generous Strife! and worthy such a Pair! How dear did Albert this Contention pay! Witness the Floods of streaming Gore, Witness the trampl'd Heaps that choak'd the Plain, And stop'd the Victors in their way. Witness the neighb'ring Sea, and sandy Shore, Drunk with the Purple Life of twice three Thousand slain. XI. Fortune, that on her Wheel capricious stands, And waves her painted Wings, Inconstant, Proud, Hood-wink'd, and shaking from her Hands Promiscuous Gifts among the Croud; Restless of Place, and still prepar'd to Flight, Was constant here, and seem'd restor'd to Sight. Won by their Merit, and resolv'd to bless The happy Brothers with a long Success— Maurice, the first resign'd to Fate. The Youngest had a longer Date, And liv'd the Space appointed to compleat The great Republick, rais'd so high before; Finish'd by him, the stately Fabrick bore Its lofty Top aspiring to the Sky: In vain the Winds and Rains around it beat, In vain below, the Waves tempestuous roar, They dash themselves, and break, and backward fly, Dispers'd and murm'ring at its Feet. Insulting Spain the fruitless Strife gives o'er, And claims Dominion there no more. Then Henry, ripe for Immortality, His Flight to Heaven eternal springs, And o'er his quiet Grave Peace spreads her downy Wings. XII. His Son, a second WILLIAM, fills his Place, And climbs to Manhood with so swift a Pace, As if he knew he had not long to stay: Such young Marcellus was, the hopeful Grace Of antient Rome, but quickly snatch'd away. Breda beheld th'advent'rous Boy, His tender Limbs in shining Armour dress'd, Where with his Father the hot Siege he press'd. His Father saw with pleasing Joy His own reflected Worth, and youthful Charms express'd. But when his Country breath'd from War's Alarms, His martial Virtues lay obscure; Nor cou'd a Warriour, form'd for Arms, Th'inglorious Rest endure; But sicken'd soon, and sudden dy'd, And left in Tears his pregnant Bride, His Bride, the Daughter of Britannia's King; Nor saw th'auspicious Pledg of Nuptial Love, VVhich from that happy Marriage was to spring; But with his Great Forefathers gain'd a blissful Seat above. XIII. Here pause, my Muse, and wind up higher The Strings of thy Pindarick Lyre! Then with bold Strains the lofty Song pursue; And bid Britannia once again review The numerous Worthies of the Line, See, like Immortals, how they shine! Each Life a History alone! And last, to crown the great Design, Look forward, and behold them all in One; Look, but spare thy fruitless Tears— 'Tis thy own William next appears. Advance Cælestial Form! Let Britain see Th'accomplish'd Glory of thy Race in Thee; XIV. So when some splendid Triumph was to come In long Procession thro the Streets of Rome, The Crowd beheld with vast Surprize The glittering Train in awful Order move To the bright Temple of Feretrian Jove, And Trophies born along imploy'd their dazl'd Eyes. But when the laurel'd Emperor, mounted high Above the rest, appear'd to sight, In his proud Car of Victory Shining with Rays excessive bright, He put the long preceding Pomp to Flight. Their Wonder cou'd no higher rise, With Joy they throng his Chariot Wheels, and rend with Shouts the Skies. XV. To thee, Great Prince! to thy extensive Mind, Not by thy Country's narrow Bounds confin'd, The Fates an ample Scene afford; And injur'd Nations claim the Succour of thy Sword. No Respite to thy Toils is giv'n, Till thou ascend thy native Heav'n: One Hydra-Head cut off, still more abound, And Twins sprout up to fill the Wound. So endless is the Task that Heroes find To tame the Monster Vice, and to reform Mankind. For this Alcides heretofore, And mighty Theseus travel'd o'er Vast Tracts of Sea and Land, and slew Wild Beasts, and Serpents gorg'd with Human Prey, From stony Dens fierce lurking Robbers drew, And bid the cheerful Traveller pass on his peaceful Way. Yet tho the toilsom Work they long pursue, To rid the World's wild pathless Field; Still pois'nous Weeds, and Thorns in Clusters grew, And large unwholesom Crops did yield, To exercise their Hands with Labours ever new. XVI. Thou, like Alcides, early didst begin, And, ev'n a Child, didst Laurel win. Two snaky Plagues around his Cradle twin'd, Sent by the jealous Wife of Jove, In speckl'd Wreaths of Death they strove The mighty Babe to bind. And twisted Faction in thy Infancy Darted her forky Tongue at Thee. But as Jove's Offspring slew his hissing Foes; So thou, descended from a Line Of Patriots no less Divine, Didst quench the brutal Rage of those Who durst thy dawning Worth oppose. The Viper Spight, crush'd by thy Virtue, shed Its yellow Juice, and at thy Feet lay dead. Thus, like the Sun, did thy great Genius rise, With Clouds around his sacred Head, Yet soon dispell'd the dropping Mists, and gilded all the Skies. XVII. Great Julius, who with generous Anger view'd The Statue of Brave Philip's braver Son, And wept to think what such a Youth subdu'd, While more in Age himself had yet so little done, Had wept much more, if he had liv'd to see The mighty Deeds atchiev'd by Thee; To see Thee at a beardless Age, Stand arm'd against th'Invader's Rage, And bravely fighting for thy Country's Liberty; While he inglorious Laurels sought, And not to save his Country fought. While He—O Stain upon the greatest Name That e'er before was known to Fame!— When Rome, his awful Mother, did demand The Sword from his unruly Hand, The Sword she gave before, Enrag'd, he spurn'd at her Command, Hurl'd at her breast the impious Steel, and bath'd it in her Gore. XVIII. Far other Battels thou hast won, Thy Standard still the Publick Good: Lavish of thine to save thy People's Blood: And when the hardy Task of War was done, With what a vast well-temper'd Mind (A Mind unknown to Rome's ambitious Son) Thy pow'rful Armies were resign'd? This Vict'ry o'er thy self was more Than all thy Conquests gain'd before. 'Twas more than Philip's Son could do, When for new Worlds the Madman cry'd; Nor in his own wild Breast had spy'd Tow'rs of Ambition, Hills of boundless Pride, Too great for Armies to subdue. XIX. O savage Lust of Arbitrary Sway! Insatiate Fury which in Man we find, In barbarous Man, to prey upon his Kind, And make the World, enslav'd, his vicious Will obey! How has this Fiend, Ambition, long defac'd Heav'ns Works, and laid the vast Creation waste! Ask Silver Rhine, with springing Rushes crown'd, As to the Sea his Waters flow, Where are the numerous Cities now That once he saw his honour'd Banks around? Scarce are their silent Ruins found; But in th'ensuing Age Trampl'd into common Ground, Will hide the horrid Monuments of Gaul's destroying Rage. All Europe too had shar'd this wretched Fate, And mourn'd her heavy Woes too late, Had not Britannia's Chief withstood The threaten'd Deluge, and repell'd To its forsaken Banks th'unwilling Flood, And in his Hand the Scales of balanc'd Kingdoms held. Well was this mighty Trust repos'd in Thee, Whose faithful Soul from private Int'rests free, (Int'rests, which vulgar Princes know) O'er all its Passions sate exalted high, As Ten'riff's Top enjoys a purer Sky, And sees the moving Clouds at distance fly below. XX. Whoe'er thy warlike Annals reads, Beholds reviv'd our valiant Edward's Deeds. Edward III. and the Black Prince.Great Edward and his Glorious Son Will own themselves in Thee outdone, Tho Crecy's desperate Fight eternal Honours won. Tho the Fifth Henry too does claim A shining Place among Britannia's Kings, And Agencourt has rais'd his Lofty Name; Yet the loud Voice of Ever-living Fame Of Thee more numerous Triumphs sings. But tho no Chief contends with Thee In all the long Records of History, Thy own Great Deeds together strive Which shall the fairest Light derive On thy Immortal Memory. Whether Seneffe's amazing Field To celebrated Mons shall yield? Or both give place to more amazing Boyn? Or if Namure's prodigious Siege must all the rest outshine? XXI. While in Hibernia's Fields the labouring Swain Shall pass the Plough o'er Skulls of Warriors slain, And turn up Bones, and broken Spears, Amaz'd he'll shew his Fellows of the Plain The Reliques of victorious Years, And tell how swift thy Arms that Kingdom did regain. Flandria, a longer Witness to thy Glory, With Wonder too repeats thy Story; How oft the Foes thy lifted Sword have seen In the hot Battel, when it bled At all its open Veins, and oft have fled As if their evil Genius thou hadst been. How when the blooming Spring began t'appear, And with new Life restor'd the Year, Confederate Princes us'd to cry, Call Britain's King—the sprightly Trumpet sound And spread the joyful Summons round! Call Britain's King, and Victory! So when the Flow'r of Greece to Battel led In Beauty's Cause, just Vengeance swore Upon the foul Adult'rer's Head, That from her Royal Lord the ravish'd Helen bore, The Grecian Chiefs of mighty Fame Impatient for the Son of Thetis wait: At last the Son of Thetis came; Troy shook her nodding Tow'rs, and mourn'd th' impending Fate XXII. O sacred Peace! Goddess serene! Adorn'd with Robes of spotless White, Fairer than Silver Floods of Light; How short has thy mild Empire been; When pregnant Time brought forth this new-born Age, At first we saw thee gently smile On the young Birth, and thy sweet Voice awhile Sung a soft Charm to martial Rage. But soon the Lion wak'd again, And stretch'd his opening Claws, and shook his grisly Mane. Soon was the Year of Triumphs past, And Janus, ushering in a New, With backward Look did pompous Scenes review But his Fore-Face with Frowns was overcast; He saw the gath'ring Storms of War, And bid his Priests aloud his Iron Gates unbar. XXIII. But Heav'n its Hero can no longer spare, To mix in our tumultuous Broils below; Yet suffer'd his foreseeing Care Those Bolts of Vengeance to prepare, Which other Hands shall throw; That Glory to a mighty Queen remains, To triumph o'er th'extinguish'd Foe. Vicem gerit illa Tonantis, The Motto on her Majesty's Coronation Medals. She shall supply the Thunderer's Place; As Pallas from th'Ætherial Plains Warr'd on the Giants impious Race, And laid their huge demolish'd Works in smoaky Ruins low. Then Anne's shall rival Great Eliza's Reign, And William's Genius with a grateful Smile Look down, and bless this happy Isle, And Peace restor'd shall wear her Olive Crown again. Reformation of Manners, A SATYR. [PART I.] How long may Heaven be banter'd by a Nation, With broken Vows, and Shams of Reformation, And yet forbear to shew its Indignation? Tell me ye Sages, who the Conscience guide, And Ecclesiastick Oracles divide, Where do the Bounds of Sovereign Patience end, How long may People undestroy'd offend? What Limits has Almighty Power prepar'd, When Mercy shall be deaf and Justice heard? If there's a Being Immortal and Immense, Who does Rewards and Punishments dispense; Why is he Passive when his Power's defy'd, And his Eternal Government's deny'd? Tell us why he that sits above the Sky, Unreins no Vengeance, lets no Thunders fly, When Villains prosper, and successful Vice Shall human Power controul, and heavenly Power despise? If 'tis because the Sins of such a Nation Are yet too small to conquer his Compassion, Then tell us to what height Mankind may sin, Before Celestial Fury must begin? How their extended Crimes may reach so high, Vengeance must follow and of course destroy; And by the common Chain of Providence, Destruction come like Cause and Consequence. Then search the dark Arcana of the Skies, And if ye can, unfold these Mysteries: His clashing Providences reconcile The partial Frown, and the unequal Smile. Tell us why some have been destroy'd betimes, While Albion's glittering Shores grow black with Crimes? Why some for early Errors are undone, Some longer still, and longer still sin on? England with all her blackening Guilt is spar'd, And Sodom's lesser Crimes receiv'd a swift Reward: And yet all this be reconcil'd to both, Impartial Justice, and unerring Truth. Why Ostia stands, and no revenging Hand Has yet dismist her from the burden'd Land: No Plague, no sulphurous Shower her exit makes, And turns her Silver Thames to Stygian Lakes, Whose uninhabitable Banks might flow With Streams as black as her that made 'em so: And as a Monument to future Times, Should send forth Vapours nauseous as her Crimes. Tell us why Carthage fell a Prey to Rome, And mourn the Fate of bright Byzantium; Why antient Troy's embrac'd by Destiny, And Rome, Immortal Rome, to Fate gives way, Yet Ostia stands, more impious far than they? Where are the Golden Gates of Palestine, Where High Superior Glory us'd to shine? The mighty City Millions dwelt within, Where Heaven's Epitome was to be seen. God's Habitation sacred to his Name, Magnificent beyond the Voice of Fame: Those loftly Pinnacles which once were seen, Bright like the Majesty that dwelt within. In which Seraphick Glory cou'd reside, Too great for humane Vision to abide; Whose glittering Fabrick, God the Architect, The Sun's less Glorious Light, did once reject. These all ha' felt the Iron hands of Fate, And Heaven's dear Darling City's desolate. No more the sacred Place commands our Awe, But all become a Curse, a Golgotha. The Reverend Pile can scarce its Ruins show, Forsook by him whose Glory made it so. Yet Ostia stands, her impious Towers defy The threatning Comets of the blazing Sky, Foreboding Signs of Ruin she despises, And all her teaching Saviour's Sacrifices; The Jews are Fools, Jerusalem's out-done, We crucify the Father, they the Son. Within her Reprobate Gates there are allow'd Worse Jews than those who crucified their God: They kill'd a Man, for they suppos'd him so; These boldly sacrifice the God they know; His Incarnation, Miracles deny, And vilely Banter his Divinity; Their old Impostor, Socinus, prefer, And the long Voyage of Heaven without a Pilot steer. Yet Ostia boasts of her Regeneration, And tells us wondrous Tales of Reformation: How against Vice she has been so severe, That none but Men of Quality may swear: How publick Lewdness is expell'd the Nation, That Private Whoring may be more in fashion: How Parish Magistrates, like pious Elves, Let none be Drunk a Sundays, but themselves: And Hackney Coach-men durst not ply the Street In Sermon-time, till they had paid the State. These, Ostia, are the Shams of Reformation, With which thou mock'st thy Maker, and the Nation; While in thy Streets unpunish'd there remain Crimes which have yet insulted Heaven in vain, Crimes which our Satyr blushes to review, And Sins thy Sister Sodom never knew: Superior Lewdness crowns thy Magistrates, And Vice grown grey usurps the Reverend Seats; Eternal Blasphemies, and Oaths abound, And Bribes among thy Senators are found. Old Venerable Jeph, with trembling Air, Antient in Sin, and Father of the Chair, Forsook by Vices he had lov'd so long, Can now be vicious only with his Tongue; Yet talks of antient Lewdness with delight, And loves to be the Justice of the Night: On Baudy Tales with pleasure he reflects, And leudly smiles at Vices he corrects. The feeble tottering Magistrate appears Willing to Wickedness in spite of Years: Struggles his Age and Weakness to resist, And fain wou'd sin, but Nature won't assist. L?l, the Pandor of thy Judgment-Seat, Has neither Manners, Honesty, nor Wit; Instead of which, he's plenteously supply'd With Nonsense, Noise, Impertinence, and Pride; Polite his Language, and his flowing Stile Scorns to suppose Good Manners worth his while; With Principles from Education stor'd, The Drudgery of Decency abhor'd; The City-Mouth, with Eloquence endu'd. To mountebank the listning Multitude, Sometimes he tunes his Tongue to soft Harangues, To banter Common Halls, and flatter Kings: And all with but an odd indifferent Grace, With Jingle on his Tongue, and Coxcomb in his Face; Definitive in Law, without Appeal, But always serves the Hand who pays him well: He trades in Justice, and the Souls of Men, And prostitutes them equally to Gain: He has his publick Book of Rates to show, Where every Rogue the Price of Life may know: And this one Maxim always goes before, He never hangs the Rich, nor saves the Poor. God-like he nods upon the Bench of State, His Smiles are Life, and if he Frowns 'tis Fate: Boldly invading Heaven's Prerogative; For with his Breath he kills or saves alive. Fraternities of Villains he maintains, Protects the Robberies, and shares the Gains, Who thieve with Toleration as a Trade, And then restore according as they're paid: With aukward scornful Phyz, and vile Grimace, The genuine Talents of an ugly Face; With haughty Tone insults the Wretch that dies, And sports with his approaching Miseries. F?e, for so sometimes unrighteous Fate Erects a Mad-man for a Magistrate, Equipt with Leudness, Oaths, and Impudence, Supplies with Vices his defect of Sense; Abandon'd to ill Manners, he retains His want of Grace as well as want of Brains. Before the Boy wore off, the Rake began, The Bully then commenc'd, and then the Man. Yet Nature seems in this to do him wrong, To give no Courage with a saucy Tongue; From whence this constant Disadvantage flows, He always gives the Words, and takes the Blows: Tho often can'd, he's uninstructed by't; But still he shews the Scoundrel with the Knight, Still scurrilous, and still afraid to fight. His Dialect's a Modern Billinsgate, Which sutes the Hosier, not the Magistrate; The same he from behind the Counter brought, And yet he practis'd worse than he was taught; Early debauch'd, in Satan's Steps he mov'd, And all Mechanick Vices he improv'd. At first he did his Sovereign's Rights invade, And rais'd his Fortune by clandestine Trade; Stealing the Customs, did his Profits bring, And 'twas his Calling to defraud his King: This is the Man that helps to rule the State, The City's New-reforming Magistrate; To execute the Justice of the Law, And keep less Villains than himself in awe; Take Mony of the Rich, and hang the Poor, And lash the Strumpet he debauch'd before. So for small Crimes poor Thieves Destruction find, And leave the Rogues of Quality behind. Search all the Christian Climes from Pole to Pole, And match for Sheriffs S?ple and C?le; Equal in Character and Dignity, This fam'd for Justice, that for Modesty: By Merit chosen for the Chair of State, This fit for Bridewell, that for Billinsgate; That richly clad to grace the Gaudy Day, For which his Father's Creditors must pay: This from the fluxing Bagnio just dismist, Rides out to make himself the City Jest. From some lascivious Dish-Clout to the Chair, To punish Lewdness and Disorders there. The Brute he rides on wou'd his Crimes detest, For that's the Animal, and this the Beast: And yet some Reformation he began; For Magistrates ne'er bear the Sword in vain. Expensive sinning always he declin'd, To frugal Whoring totally resign'd: His Avarice his Appetite opprest, Base like the Man, and brutish like the Lust: Concise in Sinning, Nature's Call supply'd, And in one Act two Vices gratified. Never was Oyster, Beggar, Cinder Whore So much caress'd by Magistrate before. They that are nice and squeamish in their Lust, 'Ts a sign the Vice is low, and wants a Gust; But he that's perfect in th'Extreme of Vice, Scorns to excite his Appetite by Price. 'Twas in his Reign we to Reform began, And set the Devil up to mend the Man. More might be said, but Satyr stay thy Rimes, And mix not his Misfortunes with his Crimes. C?n, superbly Wise and Grave of Life, Cou'd every one reform, except his Wife: Passive in Vice, he pimps to his own Fate, To shew himself a Loyal Magistrate. 'Tis doubtful who debauch'd the City more, The Maker of the Masque, or of the Whore. Nor his Religion less a Masquerade; He always drove a strange mysterious Trade: With decent Zeal, to Church he'll gravely come, To praise that God which he denies at home. Socinian T?d's his dear Ghostly Priest, And taught him all Religion to digest; Took prudent Care he shou'd not much profess, And he was ne'er addicted to Excess. And yet he Covets without Rule or End, Will sell his Wife, his Master, or his Friend; To boundless Avarice a constant Slave, Unsatisfy'd as Death, and greedy as the Grave. Now, Satyr, let us view the numerous Fry, That must succeeding Magistrates supply, And search if future Years are like to be Much better taught, or better rul'd than we. The Senators of Hospital Descent, The upper House of Ostia's Parliament, Who from Destruction should their City save, But are as wicked as they shou'd be grave: With Citizens in Petto, who at need, As these do those, so those must these succeed. D?b, the Modern Judas of the Age, Has often try'd in vain to mount the Stage: Profuse in Gifts and Bribes to God and Man, To ride the City-Horse, and wear the Chain. His Vices, Ostia, thou hast made thy own; In chusing him, thou writ'st thy own Lampoon: Fancy the haughty Wretch in Chair of State, At once the City's Shame and Magistrate; At Table set, at his right Hand a Whore, Ugly as those which he had kept before. He to do Justice, and reform our Lives, And she receive the Homage of our Wives. Now, Satyr, give another Wretch his Due, Who's chosen to reform the City too; Hate him, ye Friends to Honesty and Sense, Hate him in injur'd Beauty's just Defence: A Knighted Booby insolent and base, “Whom Man no Manners gave, nor God no Grace. The Scorn of Women, and the Shame of Men, Matcht at Threescore to innocent Fifteen; Hag-rid with jealous Whimsies let us know, He thinks he's Cuckold, 'cause he should be so: His vertuous Wife exposes to the Town, And fears her Crimes because he knows his own. Here, Satyr, let them just Reproach abide, Who sell their Daughters to oblige their Pride. The Ch?er?n begins the doleful Jest, As a Memento Mori to the rest; Who fond to raise his Generation by't, And see his Daughter buckl'd to a Knight, The Innocent unwarily betray'd, And to the Rascal join'd the hapless Maid; The Purchase is too much below the Cost, For while the Lady's gain'd, the Woman's lost. What shall we say to common Vices now, When Magistrates the worst of Crimes allow? Ostia, if e'er thou wilt reform thy Gates, 'T must be another Set of Magistrates; In Practice just, and in Profession sound; But God knows where the Men are to be found. In all thy numerous Streets 'tis hard to tell, Where the few Men of Faith and Honour dwell: Poor and despis'd, so seldom they appear, The Cynick's Lanthorn would be useful here. No City in the spacious Universe, Boasts of Religion more, or minds it less; Of Reformation talks, and Government, Backt with an Hundred Acts of Parliament: Those useless Scare-Crows of neglected Laws, That miss the Effect because they miss the Cause: Thy Magistrates, who should reform the Town, Punish the poor Mens Faults, but hide their own; Suppress the Players Booths in Smithfield-Fair, But leave the Cloysters, for their Wives are there, Where all the Scenes of Lewdness do appear. Satyr, the Arts and Mysteries forbear, Too black for thee to write, or us to hear; No Man, but he that is as vile as they, Can all the Tricks and Cheats of Trade survey. Some in clandestine Companies combine, Erect new Stocks to trade beyond the Line: With Air and empty Names beguile the Town, And raise new Credits first, then cry 'em down: Divide the empty Nothing into Shares, To set the Town together by the Ears. The Sham Projectors and the Brokers join, And both the Cully Merchant undermine; First he must be drawn in, and then betray'd, And they demolish the Machine they made. So conjuring Chymists, who with Charm and Spell Some wondrous Liquid wondrously exhale; But when the gaping Mob their Mony pay, The Charm's dissolv'd, the Vapour flies away; The wondring Bubbles stand amaz'd to see Their Mony mountebank'd to Mercury. Some fit out Ships, and double Fraights ensure, And burn the Ships to make the Voyage secure: Promiscuous Plunders thro the World commit, And with the Mony buy their safe Retreat. Others seek out to Africk's Torrid Zone, And search the burning Shores of Serralone; There in insufferable Heats they fry, And run vast Risques to see the Gold, and die: The harmless Natives basely they trepan, And barter Baubles for the Souls of Men: The Wretches they to Christian Climes bring o'er, To serve worse Heathens than they did before. The Cruelties they suffer there are such, Amboyna's nothing, they've outdone the Dutch. Cortez, Pizarro, Guzman, Penaloe, Who drank the Blood and Gold of Mexico, Who thirteen Millions of Souls destroy'd, And left one Third of God's Creation void; By Birth for Nature's Butchery design'd, Compar'd to these are merciful and kind; Death cou'd their cruellest Designs fulfil, Blood quench'd their Thirst, and it suffic'd to kill: But these the tender Coup de Grace deny, And make Men beg in vain for leave to die; To more than Spanish Cruelty inclin'd, Torment the Body and debauch the Mind: The lingring Life of Slavery preserve, And vilely teach them both to sin and serve. In vain they talk to them of Shades below, They fear no Hell, but where such Christians go; Of Jesus Christ they very often hear, Often as his blaspheming Servants swear; They hear and wonder what strange Gods they be, Can bear with Patience such Indignity. They look for Famines, Plagues, Disease, and Death, Blasts from above, and Earthquakes from beneath: But when they see regardless Heaven looks on, They curse our Gods, or think that we have none. Thus Thousands to Religion are brought o'er, And made worse Devils than they were before. Satyr, the Men of Drugs and Simples spare, 'Tis hard to search the latent Vices there; Their Theologicks too they may defend, They can't deceive, who never do pretend. As to Religion, generally they show As much as their Profession will allow: But count them all Confederates of Hell, Till B? they with one Consent expel. B?, our Satyr startles at his Name, The College Scandal, and the City's Shame; Not satisfy'd his Maker to deny, Provokes him with Lampoon and Blasphemy; And with unprecedented Insolence, Banters a God, and scoffs at Providence. No Nation in the World, but ours, would bear To hear a Wretch blaspheme the Gods they fear: His Flesh long since their Altars had adorn'd, And with his Blood appeas'd the Powers he scorn'd. But see the Badg of our Reforming Town, Some cry Religion up, some cry it down: Some worship God, and some a God defy, With equal Boldness, equal Liberty. The silent Laws decline the just Debate, Made dumb by the more silent Magistrate; And both together small Distinction put 'Twixt him that owns a God, and him that owns him not: The Modern Crime 'tis thought no being had, They knew no Atheist when our Laws were made. 'Tis hard the Laws more Freedom should allow With God above, than Magistrates below. B? unpunish'd, may Heaven and Earth defy, Dethrone Almighty Power, Almighty Truth deny; Burlesque the Sacred, High, Vnutter'd Name, And impious War with Jove himself proclaim. While Justice unconcern'd looks calmly on, And B? boasts the Conquest he has won; Insults the Christian Name, and laughs to see Religion bully'd by Philosophy. B? with far less hazard may blaspheme, Than thou may'st, Satyr, trace thy Noble Theme: The Search of Vice more hazard represents From Laws, from Councils, and from P? Thou may'st be wicked, and less Danger know, Than by informing others they are so: Thou canst no P?r, no Counsellor expose, Or dress a vicious M?r in his proper Clothes; But all the Bombs and Canon of the Law, Are soon drawn out to keep thy Pen in awe: By Laws post Facto thou may'st soon be slain, And Innuendoe's shall thy Guilt explain. Thou may'st lampoon, and no Man will resent, Lampoon but Heaven, and not the P?: Our Trustys and our Welbelov'ds forbear; Thou'rt free to banter Heaven, and all that's there; The boldest Flights thou'rt welcome to bestow O'th' Gods above, but not the Gods below. B? may banter Heaven, and A?l Death, And T?d poison Souls with his infected Breath: No Civil Government resents the Wrong, But all are touch'd and angry at thy Song. Thy Friends without the help of Prophesy, Read Goals and Gibbets in thy Destiny; But Courage springs from Truth, let it appear, Nothing but Guilt cun be the Cause of Fear. Satyr go on, thy keenest Shafts let fly, Truth can be no Offence to Honesty: The Guilty only are concern'd, and they Lampoon themselves, when e're they censure thee. PART II. The City's view'd, now Satyr turn thine Eye, The Country's Vices, and the Court's survey: And from Impartial Scrutiny set down. How much they're both more vicious than the Town. How does our Ten Years War with Vice advance? About as much as it has done with France. Ride with the Judg, and view the wrangling Bar, And see how leud our Justice-Merchants are: How Clito comes from instigating Whore, Pleads for the Man he cuckol'd just before; See how he cants, and acts the Ghostly Father, And brings the Gospel and the Law to gether: To make his pious Frauds be well receiv'd, He quotes that Scripture which he ne'er believ'd. Fluent in Language, indigent in Sense, Supplies his Want of Law with Impudence. See how he rides the Circuit with the Judg, To Law and Lewdness a devoted Drudg. A Brace of Female Clients meet him there. To help debauch the Sizes and the Fair: By Day he plies the Bar with all his might, And Revels in St. Ed?'s Streets at Night: The Scandal of the Law, his own Lampoon, Is Lawyer, Merchant, Bully, and Buffoon; In drunken Quarrels eager to engage, Till Brother Justice lodg'd him in the Cage: A thing the Learned thought could never be, Had not the Justice been as drunk as he. He pleads of late at Hymen's Nuptial Bar, And bright Aurelia is Defendant there. He courts the Nymph to wed, and make a Wife, And swears by G? he will reform his Life. The solemn Part he might ha' well forbore, For she alas! has been, has been a Whore: The pious Dame the sober Saint puts on, And Clito's in the way to be undone. Casco's debauch'd, 'tis his Paternal Vice; For Wickedness descends to Families: The tainted Blood the Seeds of Vice convey, And plants new Crimes before the old decay. Thro all Degrees of Vice the Father run, But sees himself outsin'd by either Son; Whoring and Incest he has understood, And they subjoin Adultery and Blood. This does the Orphan's Cause devoutly plead, Secures her Mony and her Maidenhead: And then persuades her to defend the Crime, Evade the Guilt, and banter off the Shame. Taught by the subtile Counsellour, she shows More nice Distinctions than Ignatius knows: In Matrimony finds a learned flaw, A Wife in Honour, and a Wife in Law. “Choice is the Substance of the Contract made, “And mutual Love the only Knot that's ty'd: “To these the Laws of Nations must submit, “And where they fail, the Contract's incomplete. “So that if Love and Choice were not before, “The last may be the Wife, the first the Whore. Thus she securely sins with eager Gust, And satisfies her Conscience and her Lust: Nor does her Zeal and Piety omit, But to the Whore she joins the Jesuit: With constant Zeal frequents the House of Prayer, To heal her prostituted Conscience there; Without remorse, adjourns with full Content, From his lascivious Arms to th'Sacrament. The Brother less afraid of Sin than Shame, Doubles his Guilt, to save his tottering Fame: 'Twas too much risque for any Man to run, To save that Credit which before was gone: The Innocent lies unreveng'd in Death, He stop'd the growing Scandal in her Breath: Till time shall lay the horrid Murder bare; No Bribes can crush the Writs of Error there. Nor is the Bench less tainted than the Bar; How hard's that Plague to cure that's spread so far! 'Twill all prescrib'd Authorities reject, While they're most guilty who should first correct. Contagious Vice infects the Judgment-Seats, And Vertue from Authority retreats: How should she such Society endure? Where she's contemn'd she cannot be secure. Milo's a Justice, they that made him so Should answer for th'oppressive Wrongs he'll do; His Lands almost to Ostia's Walls extend; And of his heap'd up Thousands there's no end, If Magistrates, as in the Text 'tis clear, Ought to be such as Avarice abhor, This may be known of the Almighty's Mind, That Milo's not the Man the Text design'd. Satyr, be bold, and fear not to expose The vilest Magistrate the Nation knows: Let Furius read his naked Character, Blush not to write what he should blush to hear; But let them blush, who in a Christian State Made such a Devil be a Magistrate. In Britain's Eastern Provinces he reigns, And serves the Devil with excessive Pains: The Nation's Shame, and honest Mens surprize, With Drunkard in his Face, and Madman in his Eyes. The Sacred Bench of Justice he profanes, With a polluted Tongue and bloody Hands: His Intellects are always in a Storm, He frights the People whom he should reform. Antipathys may some Diseases cure, But Vertue can no Contraries endure. All Reformation stops when Vice commands, Corrupted Heads can ne'er have upright Hands. Shameless ith' Class of Justices he'll swear, And plants the Vices he should punish there. His Mouth's a Sink of Oaths and Blasphemies, And Cursings are his kind Civilities; His fervent Prayers to Heaven he hourly sends, But 'tis to damn himself and all his Friends; He raves in Vice, and storms that he's confin'd, And studies to be worse than all Mankind. Extremes of Wickedness are his Delight, And's pleas'd to hear that he's distinguish'd by't; Exotick ways of Sinning he improves, We curse and hate, he curses where he loves; So strangely retrograde to all Mankind, If crost he damns himself, if pleas'd his Friend. This is the Man that helps to bless the Nation, And bully Mankind into Reformation, The true Coercive Power of the Law, Which drives the People which it cannot draw: The Nation's Scandal, England's true Lampoon, A Drunken, Whoring, Justicing Buffoon. With what stupendious Impudence can he Punish a poor Man's Immorality? How should a Vicious Magistrate assent To mend our Manners or our Government? How shall new Laws for Reformation pass, If Vice the Legislation should possess? To see Old S?y Blasphemy decry, And S?e vote to punish Bribery; Lying exploded by a Perjur'd Knight, And Whoring punish'd by a Sodomite: That he the Peoples Freedom should defend, Who had the King and People too trepan'd. Soldiers seek Peace, Drunkards prohibit Wine, And Fops and Beaux our Politicks refine: These are Absurdities too gross to hide, Which wise Men wonder at, and Fools deride. When from the Helm Socinian H?t flies, And all the rest his Tenents stigmatize, And none remain that Jesus Christ denies. Judas expell'd, Lewd, Lying C? sent home, And Men of Honesty put in their room. Blaspheming B?s to his Fen-Ditches sent, To bully Justice with a Parliament, Then we shall have a Christian Government. Then shall the wish'd for Reformation rise, And Vice to Vertue fall a Sacrifice. And with the nauseous Rabble that retire, Turn out that Bawdy, Saucy Poet P?; A Vintner's Boy the Wretch was first prefer'd, To wait at Vice's Gates, and pimp for Bread; To hold the Candle, and sometimes the Door, Let in the Drunkard, and let out the Whore: But, as to Villains it has often chanc'd, Was for his Wit and Wickedness advanc'd. Let no Man think his new behaviour strange, No Metamorphosis can Nature change; Effects are chain'd to Causes, generally The Rascal born will like a Rascal die. His Prince's Favours follow'd him in vain, They chang'd the Circumstance, but not the Man. While out of Pocket, and his Spirits low, He'd beg, write Panegyricks, cringe and bow; But when good Pensions had his Labours crown'd, His Panegyricks into Satyrs turn'd, And with a true Mechanick Spirit curst, Abus'd his Royal Benefactor first. O what assiduous Pains does P? take, To let great D? see he could mistake! Dissembling Nature false Description gave, Shew'd him the Poet, and conceal'd the Knave. To?d, if such a Wretch is worth our Scorn, Shall Vice's blackest Catalogue adorn; His hated Character, let this supply, Too vile even for our University. Now, Satyr, to one Character be just, M?n's the only Pattern and the first: A Title which has more of Honour in't, Than all his antient Glories of Descent. Most Men their Neighbours Vices will disown, But he's the Man that first reforms his own. Let those alone reproach his want of Sense, Who with his Crimes have had his Penitence. 'Tis want of Sense makes Men when they do wrong, Adjourn their promis'd Penitence too long: Nor let them call him Coward, 'cause he fears To pull both God and Man about his Ears. Amongst the worst of Cowards let him be nam'd, Who having sin'd 's afraid to be asham'd: And to mistaken Courage he's betray'd, Who having sin'd 's asham'd to be afraid. Thy Valour, M?, does our Praise prevent, For thou hast had the Courage to repent: Nor shall his first Mistakes our Censure find, What Heaven forgets let no Man call to mind. Satyr, make search thro all this sober Age, To bring one season'd Drunkard on the Stage; Sir Stephen, nor Sir Thomas won't suffice, Nor six and Twenty Kentish Justices: Your E?x Priesthood hardly can supply, Tho they're enough to drink the Nation dry. Tho Parson B?d has been steept in Wine, And sunk the Royal Tankard on the Rhine, He's not the Man that's fit to raise a Breed, Should P?k, P?l, or R?n succeed Or match the Size of matchless Rochester, And make one long Debauch of Thirteen Year; It must be something can Mankind out-do, Some high Excess that's wonderful and new. Nor will Mechanick Sots our Satyr sute, Tis Quality must grace the Attribute. These like the lofty Cedars to the Shrub, Drink Maudlin-College down, and Royston-Club. Such petty Drinking's a Mechanick Evil, But he's a Drunkard that out-drinks the Devil: If such cannot in Court or Church appear, Let's view the Camp, you'll quickly find 'em there. Brave T?n, who revell'd Day and Night, And always kept himself too drunk to fight; And O?d in a Sea of Sulphur strove To let the Spaniards see the Vice we love. Yet these are puny Sinners, if you'll look The dreadful Roll in Fate's Authentick Book. The Monument of Bacchus still remains, Where English Bones lie heap'd in Irish Plains: Triumphant Death upon our Army trod, And revell'd at Dundalk in English Blood. Let no Man wonder at the dreadful Blow, For Heaven has seldom been insulted so. In vain Brave Schomberg mourn'd the Troops that fell, While he made Vows to Heaven and they to Hell. Our Satyr trembles to review those Times, And hardly finds out Words to name their Crimes; In every Tent the horrid Juncto's sate, To brave their Maker and despise their Fate; The Work was done, Drunk'ness was gone before, Life was suspended, Death could do no more. Five Regimented Heroes there appear, Captains of Thousands, mighty Men of War, Glutted with Wine, and drunk with Hellish Rage, For want of other Foes they Heaven engage. Sulphur and ill-extracted Fumes agree, To make each Drop push on their Destiny. Th'Infernal Draughts in Blasphemies rebound, And openly the Devil's Health went round: Nor can our Verse their latent Crime conceal, How they shook hands to meet next day in Hell; Death pledg'd them, Fate the dreadful Compact read, Concurring Justice spoke, and four or, five lay dead. When Men their Maker's Vengeance once defy, 'Ts a certain Sign that their Destruction's nigh. 'Tis vain to single out Examples here, Drunk'ness will soon be th'Nation's Character; The grand Contagion's spreading over all, 'Tis Epidemick now, and National. Since then the Sages all Reproofs despise, Let's quit the People and Lampoon the Vice. Drunk'ness is so the Error of the Time, The Youth begin to ask if 'tis a Crime: Wonder to see the grave Patricians come, From City Courts of Conscience reeling home; And think 'tis hard they should no Licence make, To give the Freedom which their Fathers take. The Seat of Judgment's so debauch'd with Wine, Justice seems rather to be drunk than blind: Lets fall the Sword, and her unequal Scale Makes Right go down, and Injury prevail. A Vice, 'tis thought, the Devil at first design'd Not to allure, but to affront Mankind; A Pleasure Nature hardly can explain, Sutes none of God Almighty's Brutes but Man. An Act so nauseous, that had Heaven enjoyn'd The Practice, as a Duty on Mankind, They'd shun the Bliss which came so foul a way, And forfeit Heaven, rather than once obey. A double Crime, by which one Act w' undo At once the Gentleman and Christian too; For which no better Antidote is known, Than t'have one Drunkard to another shown. The Mother Conduit of expatiate Sin, Where all the Seeds of Wickedness begin; The Introduction to Eternal Strife, And Prologue to the Tragedy of Life; A foolish Vice, does needless Crimes reveal, And only tells the Truth it should conceal. 'Tis strange how Men of Sense should be subdu'd By Vices so unnatural and rude; Which gorge the Stomach to divert the Head, And to make Mankind merry, make them mad: Destroys the Vitals, and distracts the Brain, And rudely moves the Tongue to talk in vain; Dismisses Reason, stupifies the Sense, And wondring Nature's left in strange suspence; The Soul's benumb'd, and ceases to inform, And all the Sea of Nature's in a Storm; The dead unactive Organ feels the Shock, And willing Death attends the fatal Stroke. And is this all for which Mankind endure Distempers past the Power of Art to cure? For which our Youth old Age anticipate, And with luxurious Drafts suppress their Vital Heat? Tell us ye Learned Doctors of the Vice, Wherein the high mysterious Pleasure lies? The great sublime Enjoyment's laid so deep, 'Tis known in Dream, and understood in Sleep. The Graduates of the Science first commence, And gain Perfection when they lofe their Sense: Titles they give, which call their Vice to mind, But Sot's the common Name for all the Kind: Nature's Fanaticks, who their Sense employ, The Principles of Nature to destroy. A Drunkard is a Creature God ne'er made, The Species Man, the Nature retrograde; From all the Sons of Paradise they seem To differ in the most acute Extreme; Those covet Knowledg, labour to be wise, These stupify the Sense and put out Reason's Eyes. For Health and Youth those all their Arts employ, These strive their Youth and Vigour to destroy; Those damn themselves to heap an ill-got Store, These liquidate their Wealth, and covet to be poor. Satyr, examine now with heedful Care, What the rich Trophies of the Bottle are, The mighty Conquests which her Champions boast, The Prizes which they gain, and Price they cost. The Ensigns of her Order soon displace Nature's most early Beauties from the Face. Paleness at first succeeds, and languid Air, And bloated Yellows supersede the Fair; The flaming Eyes betray the nitrous Flood, Which quench the Spirits, and inflame the Blood, Disperse the Rosy Beauties of the Face, And fiery Blotches triumph in the place; The tottering Head and trembling Hand appears, And all the Marks of Age, without the Years; Distorted Limbs gross and unweildy move, And hardly can pursue the Vice they love. A Bacchanalian Scarlet dyes the Skin, A sign what sulphurous Streams arise within. The Flesh emboss'd with Ulcers, and the Brain Oppress'd with Fumes and Vapour, shews in vain What once before the Fire it did contain. Strange Power of Wine! whose Vehicle the same At once can both extinguish and inflame: Keen as the Lightning does the Sword consume, And leaves the untouch'd Scabbard in its room. Nature burnt up with fiery Vapour dies, And Wine a little while Mock-Life supplies: Gouts and old Aches, Life's short Hours divide, At once the Drunkard's Punishment and Pride: Who having all his youthful Powers subdu'd, Enjoys old Age and Pain before he should. Till Nature quite exhausted quits the Wretch, And leaves more Will than Power to debauch. With Hellish Pleasure past Excess he views, And fain would drink, but Nature must refuse: Thus drench'd in artificial Flame he lies, Drunk in Desire, forgets himself and dies. In the next Regions he expects the same: And Hell's no Change, for here he liv'd in Flame. Satyr, to Church; visit the House of Prayer, And see the wretched Reformation there; Unveil the Mask, and search the Sacred Sham; For Rogues of all Religions are the same. The several Tribes their numerous Titles view, And fear no Censure where the Fact is true. They all shall have thee for their constant Friend, Who more than common Sanctity pretend; Provided they'll take care the World may see Their Practices and their Pretence agree. But count them with the worst of Hypocrites, Whom Zeal divides, and Wickedness unites, Who in Profession only are precise, Dissent in Doctrine, and conform in Vice. They who from the Establish'd Church divide, Must do it out of Piety or Pride; And their Sincerity is quickly try'd. For always they that stand before the first, Will be the best of Christians, or the worst. But shun their secret Counsels, O my Soul! Whose Interest can their Consciences controul; Those Ambo-Dexters in Religion, who Can any thing dispute, yet any thing can do: Those Christian-Mountebanks, that in disguise Can reconcile Impossibilities: Alternately conform, and yet dissent, And sin with both Hands, but with one repent. The Man of Conscience all Mankind will love, The Knaves themselves his Honesty approve: He only to Religion can pretend, The rest do for the Name alone contend. The Verity of true Religion's known By no Description better than its own: Of Truth and Wisdom it informs the Mind, And nobly strives to civilize Mankind; With potent Vice maintains Eternal Strife, Corrects the Manners, and reforms the Life. Tells us, ye learned Magi of the Schools, Who pose Mankind with Ecclesiastick Rules, What strange amphibious Things are they, that can Religion without Honesty maintain, Who own a God, pretended Homage pay, But neither his, nor humane Laws obey? Blush England, hide thy Hypocritick Face, Who has no Honesty, can have no Grace. In vain we argue from Absurdities, Religion's bury'd just when Virtue dies: Virtue's the Light by which Religion's known, If this be wanting, Heaven will that disown. We grant it merits no Divine Regard, And Heaven is all from Bounty, not Reward: But God must his own Nature contradict, Reverse the World, its Government neglect, Cease to be just, Eternal Law repeal, Be weak in Power, and mutable in Will, If Vice and Vertue equal Fate should know, And that unbless'd, or this unpunish'd go. In vain we strive Religion to disguise, And smother it with Ambiguities: Interest and Priest—may perhaps invent Strange Mysterys, by way of Supplement: School-men may deep perplexing Doubts disclose, And subtile Notions on the World impose; Till by their Ignorance they are betray'd, And lost in Desarts which themselves ha' made. Zealots may cant, and Dreamers may divine, And formal Fops to Pageantry incline; And all with specious Gravity pretend Their spurious Metaphysicks to defend. Religion's no divided Mystick Name, For true Religion always is the same; Naked and plain her Sacred Truths appear, From pious Frauds and dark Ænigma's clear: The meanest Sense may all the Parts discern, What Nature teaches all Mankind may learn: E'en what's reveal'd is no untrodden Path, 'Tis known by Rule, and understood by Faith; The Negatives and Positives agree, Illustrated by Truth and Honesty. And yet if all Religion was in vain, Did no Rewards or Punishments contain, Vertue's so suted to our Happiness, That none but Fools could be in love with Vice. Vertue's a native Rectitude of Mind, Vice the Degeneracy of Human Kind: Vertue is Wisdom Solid and Divine, Vice is all Fool without, and Knave within: Vertue is Honour circumscrib'd by Grace, Vice is made up of every thing that's base: Vertue has secret Charms which all Men love, And those that do not choose her, yet approve: Vice like ill Pictures which offend the Eye, Make those that made them their own Works deny: Vertue's the Health and Vigour of the Soul, Vice is the foul Disease infects the whole: Vertue's the Friend of Life, and Soul of Health, The Poor Man's Comfort, and the Rich Man's Wealth: Vice is a Thief, a Traytor in the Mind, Assassinates the Vitals of Mankind; The Poison of his high Prosperity, And only Misery of Poverty. To States and Governments they both extend, Vertue's their Life and Being, Vice their End: Vertue establishes, and Vice destroys, And all the Ends of Government unties: Vertue's an English King and Parliament, Vice is a Czar-of-Muscow Government: Vertue sets Bounds to Kings, and limits Crowns; Vice knows no Law, and all Restraint disowns: Vertue prescribes all Government by Rules; Vice makes Kings Tyrants, and their Subjects Fools: Vertue seeks Peace, and Property maintains; Vice binds the Captive World in hostile Chains: Vertue's a beauteous Building form'd on high, Vice is Confusion and Deformity. In vain we strive these two to reconcile, Vain and impossible, th'unequal Toil: Antipathies in Nature may agree, Darkness and Light, Discord and Harmony; The distant Poles in spite of Space may kiss, Water capitulate, and Fire make Peace: But Good and Evil never can agree, Eternal Discord's there, Eternal Contrariety. In vain the Name of Vertue they put on, Who preach up Piety, and practise none. Satyr, resume the Search of secret Vice, Conceal'd beneath Religion's fair Disguise. Solid's a Parson Orthodox and Grave, Learning and Language more than most Men have; A fluent Tongue, a well-digested Stile, His Angel Voice his Hearers Hours beguile; Charm'd them with Godliness, and while he spake, We lov'd the Doctrine for the Teachers sake. Strictly to all Prescription he conforms, To Canons, Rubrick, Discipline, and Forms; Preaches, disputes, with Diligence and Zeal, Labours the Church's latent Wounds to heal. 'Twould be uncharitable to suggest, Where this is found we should not find the rest: Yet Solid's frail and false, to say no more, Dotes on a Bottle, and what's worse, a W? Two Bastard Sons he educates abroad, And breeds them to the Function of the Word. In this the zealous Church-man he puts on, And dedicates his Labour to the Gown. P?, for so his Grace the Duke thought fit, Has in the Wild of Sussex made his Seat: His want of Manners we could here excuse, For in his Day 'twas out of Pulpit-use; Railing was then the Duty of the Day, Their Sabbath-work was but to scold and pray. But when transplanted to a Country Town, 'Twas hop'd he'd lay his fiery Talent down: At least we thought he'd so much Caution use, As not his Noble Patron to abuse. But 'tis in vain to cultivate Mankind, When Pride has once possession of his Mind. Not all his Grace's Favours could prevail To calm that Tongue that was so us'd to rail. Promiscuous Gall his Learned Mouth desil'd, And Hypocondriack Spleen his Preaching spoil'd; His undistinguish'd Censure he bestows, Not by Desert, but as Ill-nature flows. The Learned say the Causes are from hence, An Ebb of Manners, and a Flux of Sense; Dilated Pride, the Frenzy of the Brain, Exhal'd the Spirits, and disturb'd the Man; And so the kindest thing that can be said, Is not to say he's mutinous, but mad: For less could ne'er his Antick Whims explain, He thought his Belly pregnant as his Brain; Fancy'd himself with Child, and durst believe, That he by Inspiration could conceive; And if the Heterogeneous Birth goes on, He hopes to bring his Mother Church a Son: Tho some Folks think the Doctor ought to doubt, Not how't got in, but how it will get out. Hark, Satyr, now bring Boanerges down, A fighting Priest, a Bully of the Gown: In double Office he can serve the Lord, To fight his Battels, and to preach his Word; And double Praise is to his Merit due, He thumps the Pulpit and the People too. Then search my L? of L? Diocess, And see what R? the Care of Souls possess; Beseech his L? but to name the Priest, Went sober from his Visitation Feast. Tell him of sixteen Ecclesiastick Guides, On whom no Spirit but that of Wine abides; Who in contiguous Parishes remain, And preach the Gospel once a Week in vain: But in their Practices unpreach it all, And sacrifice to Bacchus and to Baal. Tell him a Vicious Priesthood must imply A carless or defective Prelacy. But still be circumspect and spare the Gown, The Mitre's full as Sacred as the Crown; The Church Sea is always in a Storm, Leave them Latter Lammas to reform. If in their G Vice thou should'st appear, Thou'lt certain to be lost and shipwrack'd there: Nor meddle with their Convocation Feuds, The Church's F?, the Clergy's Interludes; Their Church-Distinctions too let us lay by, As who are low Church R? and who are high. Enquire not who their Passive Doctrine broke, Who swore at random, or who ly'd by Book: But since their Frailties come so very fast, 'Tis plain they should not be believ'd in hast. Satyr, for Reasons we ha' told before, With gentle Strokes the Men of Posts pass o'er; Nor within Gun-shot of St. Stephen's come, Unless thou'rt well prepar'd for Martyrdom; Not that there's any want of Subject there, But the more Crimes we have the less we'll hear. And what hast thou to do with S? P?? Let them sin on and tempt the Fatal Hour. 'Tis vain to preach up dull Morality, Where too much Crime and too much Power agree; The hardn'd Guilt undocible appears, They'll exercise their Hands, but not their Ears. Let their own Crimes be punishment enough, And let them want the Favour of Reproof. Let the Court Ladies be as lewd as fair, Let Wealth and Wickedness be M? Care; Let D? drench his Wit with his Estate, And O? sin in spite of Age and Fate; On the wrong side of Eighty let him whore, He always was, and will be lewd and poor. Let D? be proud, and O? gay, Lavish of vast Estates, and scorn to pay: The antient D? has sin'd to's Heart's content, And, but he scorns to stoop, would now repent; Would Heaven abate but that one darling Sin, He'd be a Christian and a P? again. Let poor Corrina mourn her Maidenhead, And her lost D? gone out to fight for Bread. Be he embark'd for P? or S? She prays he never may return again, For fear she always should resist in vain. Satyr, forbear the blushing Sex t'expose, For all their Vice from Imitation flows; And 'twould be but a very dull Pretence, To miss the Cause, and blame the Consequence: But let us make Mankind asham'd to sin, Good Nature'l make the Women all come in. This one Request shall thy Rebukes express, Only to talk a little little less. Now view the Beaus at Will's, the Men of Wit, By Nature nice, and for Discerning fit: The finish'd Fops, the Men of Wig and Snuff, Knights of the Famous Oyster-Barrel Muff. Here meets the Dyet of Imperial Wit, And of their weighty Matters wisely treat; Send Deputies to Tunbridg and the Bath, To guide young Country Beau's in Wit's unerring Path. Prigson from Nurse and Hanging-sleeves got free, A little smatch of Modern Blasphemy; A powder'd Wig, a Sword, a Page, a Chair, Learns to take Snuff, drinks Chocolate, and swear. Nature seems thus far to ha' led him on, And no Man thinks he was a Fop too soon, But 'twas the Devil surely drew him in, Against the Light of Nature thus to sin: That he who was a Coxcomb so compleat, Should now put in his wretched Claim for Wit. Such sober Steps Men to their Ruin take, A Fop, a Beau, a Wit, and then a Rake. Fate has the Scoundrel Party halv'd in two, The Wits are shabby, and the Fops are Beau; The Reason's plain, the Mony went before, And so the Wits are Rakish 'cause they're poor. Indulgent Heaven for Decency thought fit, That some shou'd have the Mony, and some the Wit. Fools are a Rent-Charge left on Providence, And have Equivalents instead of Sense; To whom he's bound a larger Lot to carve, Or else they'd seem to ha' been born to starve, Such with their double Dole shou'd be content, And not pretend to Gifts that Heaven ne're sent: For 'twou'd reflect upon the Power Supream, If all his Mercies ran in one contracted Stream: The Men of Wit would by their Wealth be known, Some wou'd have all the Good, and some ha' none. The useless Fools wou'd in the World remain, As Instances that Heaven cou'd work in vain. Dull Flettumacy has his Heart's Delight, Gets up i'th' Morning to lie down at Night; His Talk's a Mass of weighty Emptiness, None more of Business prates, or knows it less; A painted Lump of Idleness and Sloth, And in the Arms of Bacchus spends his Youth: The waiting Minutes tend on him in vain, Mispent the past, unvalued those remain. Time lies as useless, unregarded by, Needless to him that's only born to die; And yet this undiscerning thing has Pride, And hugs the Fop that wiser Men deride. Pride's a most useful Vertue in a Fool, The humble Coxcomb's always made a Tool: Conceit's a Blockhead's only Happiness, He'd hang himself if he cou'd use his Eyes. If Fools cou'd their own Ignorance discern, They'd be no longer Fools. From whence some wise Philosophers ha' said, Fools may sometimes be sullen, but can't be mad. 'Tis too much thinking which distracts the Brain, Crouds it with Vapours which dissolve in vain; The fluttering Wind of undigested Thought Keeps Mock Idea's in, and true ones out: These guide the undirected Wretch along, With giddy Head and inconsistent Tongue. But Flettumacy's safe, he's none of them, Bedlam can never lay her Claim to him; Nature secur'd his unincumbred Scull, For Flettumacy never thinks at all: Supinely sleeps in Diadora's Arms, Doz'd with the Magick of her Craft and Charms; The subtil Dame brought up in Vice's School, Can love the Cully, tho she hates the Fool: Wisely her just Contempt of him conceals, And hides the Follies he himself reveals. 'Tis plain the Self-denying Jilt's i'th' Right, She wants his Money, and he wants her Wit. Satyr, the Men of Rhyme and Jingle shun, Hast thou not Rhim'd thy self till thou'rt undone? On Rakish Poets let us not reflect, They only are what all Mankind expect. Yet 'tis not Poets have debauch'd the Times, 'Tis we that have so damn'd their sober Rhymes: The Tribe's good-natur'd and desire to please, And when you snarl at those, present you these. The World has lost its ancient Tast of Wit, And Vice comes in to raise the Appetite; For Wit has lately got the start of Sence, And serves it self as well with Impudence. Let him whose Fate it is to write for Bread, Keep this one Maxim always in his Head: If in this Age he would expect to please, He must not cure, but nourish their Disease. Dull Moral things will never pass for Wit, Some Years ago they might, but now 'ts too late. Vertue's the saint Green-sickness of the Times, 'Tis luscious Vice gives Spirit to all our Rhymes. In vain the sober thing inspir'd with Wit, Writes Hymns and Histories from Sacred Writ; But let him Blasphemy and Bawdy write, The Pious and the Modest both will buy't. The blushing Virgin's pleas'd, and loves to look, And plants the Poem next her Prayer-Book. W?ly with Pen and Poverty beset, And Bl?re vers'd in Physick as in Wit; Tho this of Jesus, that of Job may sing, One Bawdy Play will twice their Profits bring: And had not both carest the Flatter'd Crown, This had no Knighthood seen, nor that no Gown, Had Vice no Power the Fancy to bewitch, Dryden had hang'd himself as well Creech; Durfey had starv'd, and half the Poets fled, In Foreign Parts to pawn their Wit for Bread. 'Tis Wine or Lewdness all our Theams supplies, Gives Poets Power to write, and Power to please: Let this describe the Nation's Character, One Man reads Milton, forty Rochester. This lost his Taste, they say, when h' lost his Sight; Milton had Thought, but Rochester had Wit. The Case is plain, the Temper of the Time, One wrote the Lewd, and t'other the Sublime. And shou'd Apollo now descend to write In Vertue's Praise, 'twou'd never pass for Wit. The Bookseller perhaps wou'd say, 'Twas well: But 'Twou'd not hit the Times, 'Twou'd never Sell; Unless a Spice of Lewdness cou'd appear, The sprightly part wou'd still be wanting there. The Fashionable World wou'd never read, Nor the Unfashionable Poet get his Bread. 'Tis Love and Honour must enrich our Verse, The Modern Terms, our Whoring to rehearse. The sprightly part attends the God of Wine, The Drunken Stile must blaze in every Line. These are the Modern Qualities must do, To make the Poem and the Poet too. Dear Satyr, if thou wilt reform the Town, Thou'lt certainly be beggar'd and undone: 'Tis at thy Peril; if thou wilt proceed To cry down Vice, Mankind will never read. CONCLUSION. What strange Mechanick Thoughts of God and Man, Must this unsteady Nation entertain, To think Almighty Science can be blind, Wisdom it self be banter'd by Mankind; Eternal Providence be mock'd with Lies, With Out-sides and Improbabilities, With Laws, those Rodomanta's of the State, Long Proclamations, and the Lord knows what Societies ill Manners to suppress, And new sham Wares with Immoralities: While they themselves to common Crimes betray'd, Can break the very Laws themselves ha' made. With Jehu's Zeal they furiously reform, And raise false Clouds which end without a Storm; But with a loose to Vice, securely see The Subject punish'd, and themselves go free. For shame your Reformation-Clubs give o'er, And jest with Men, and jest with Heaven no more: But if you wou'd avenging Powers appease, Avert the Indignation of the Skies; Impending Ruin avoid, and calm the Fates; Ye Hypocrites, reform your Magistrates. Your Quest of Vice at Church and Court begin, There lie the Seeds of high expatiate Sin; 'Tis they can check the Vices of the Town, When e'er they please but to suppress their own: Our Modes of Vice from their Examples came, And their Examples only must reclaim. In vain you strive ill Manners to suppress, By the Superlatives of Wickedness: Ask but how well the Drunken Plow-man looks, Set by the swearing Justice in the Stocks; And poor Street-Whores in Bridewel feel their Fate, While Harlot M?n rides in Coach of State. The Mercenary Scouts in every Street, Bring all that have no Money to your Feet; And if you lash a Strumpet of the Town, She only smarts for want of Half a Crown: Your Annual Lists of Criminals appear, But no Sir Harry or Sir Charles is there. You Proclamations Rank and File appear, To bug-bear Vice, and put Mankind in fear: These are the Squibs and Crackers of the Law, Which hiss and make a Bounce, and then withdraw. Law like the Thunder of Immortal Jove, Rings Peals of Terror from the Powers above; But when the pointed Lightnings disappear, The Cloud dissolves, and all's serene and clear. Law only aids Men to conceal their Crimes, But 'tis Example must reform the Times: Force and Authorities are all in vain, Unless you can perswade, you'll ne'er constrain; And all perswasive Power expires of Course, 'Till back'd with good Examples to enforce. The Magistrates must Blasphemy forbear, Be faultless first themselves, and then severe; Impartial Justice equally dispense, And fear no Man, nor fear no Man's Offence; Then may our Justices, and not before, When they reprove the rich, correct the poor. The Men of Honour must from Vice dissent, Before the Rakes and Bullies will repent; Vertue must be the Fashion of the Town, Before the Beaus and Ladies put it on; Wit must no more be Bawdy and Profane, Or Wit to Vertue's reconcil'd in vain. The Clergy must be sober, grave and wise, Or else in vain they cant of Paradise: Our Reformation never can prevail, While Precepts govern and Examples fail. Were but the Ladies vertuous as they're fair, The Beaus would blush as often as they swear; Vice wou'd grow antiquated in the Town, Wou'd all our Men of Mode but cry it down: For Sin's a Slave to Custom, and will die, Whenever Habits suffer a Decay; And therefore all our Reformation here, Must work upon our Shame and not our Fear. If once the Mode of Vertue wou'd begin, The Poor will quickly be asham'd to sin. Fashion is such a strange bewitching Charm, For fear of being laugh'd at they'll reform; And yet Posterity will blush to hear, Royal Examples ha' been useless here; The only Just Exception to our Rule, Vertues not learnt in this Imperial School. In vain Maria's Character we read, So few will in her Path of Vertue tread. In vain her Royal Sister recommends Vertue to be the Test of all her Friends, Back'd with her own Example and Commands. Our Church establish'd, and our Trade restor'd, Our Friends protected, and our Peace secur'd: France humbl'd, and our Fleets insulting Spain, These are the Triumphs of a Female Reign; At Home her milder Influence she imparts, Queen of our Vows, and Monarch of our Hearts. If Change of Sexes thus will change our Scenes, Grant Heaven we always may be rul'd by Queens. The Play-House: A Satyr. By T. G. Gent. Near to the Rose where Punks in numbers flock, To pick up Cullies, to increase the Stock; A Lofty Fabrick does the Sight invade, And stretches round the place a pompous Shade; Where sudden Shouts the Neighbourhood surprize, And Thund'ring Claps, and dreadful Hissings rise. Here Thrifty R? hires Monarchs by the Day, And keeps his Mercenary Kings in Pay; With deep-mouth Actors fills the Vacant Scenes, And drains the Town for Goddesses and Queens: Here the lewd Punk, with Crowns and Scepters grac'd, Teaches her Eyes a more Majestick Cast; And hungry Monarchs with a numerous Train Of Supplicant Slaves, like Sancho, Starve and Reign. But enter in, my Muse, the Stage survey, And all its Pomp and Pageantry display; Trap-Doors and Pit-falls, from th'unfaithful Ground, And Magic Walls, encompass it around: On either side maim'd Temples fill our Eyes, And intermixt with Brothel-Houses rise; Disjointed Palaces in order stand, And Groves obedient to the mover's Hand, O'ershade the Stage, and flourish at Command. A Stamp makes broken Towns and Trees entire: So when Amphion struck the Vocal Lire, He saw the Spacious Circuit all around, With crowding Woods, and Neighb'ring Cities crown'd. But next the Tyring-Room survey and see, False Titles, and promiscuous Quality, Confus'dly swarm from Heroes, and from Queens, To those that swing in Clouds and fill Machines. Their various Characters they chose with Art, The Frowning Bully fits the Tyrant's part: Swoln Cheecks, and swaggering Belly makes a Host, Pale meager Looks, and hollow Voice a Ghost; From careful Brows, and heavy down-cast Eyes, Dull Cits, and thick-scull'd Aldermen arise: The Comick Tone, inspir'd by F?r, draws At every Word loud Laughter and Applause: The Mincing Dame continues as before, Her Character's unchang'd, and acts a Whore. Above the rest, the Prince with mighty Stalks, Magnificent in Purple Buskins walks: The Royal Robe his Haughty Shoulders grace, Profuse of Spangles and of Copper-Lace: Officious Rascals to his mighty Thigh, Guiltless of Blood, th'unpointed Weapon tye; Then the Gay Glittering Diadem put on, Pondrous with Brass, and star'd with Bristol stone. His Royal Consort next consults her Glass, And out of twenty Boxes culls a Face. The Whit'ning first her Ghastly Looks besmears, All Pale and Wan th'unfinish'd Form appears; Till on her Cheeks the Blushing Purple glows, And a false Virgin Modesty bestows; Her ruddy Lips the Deep Vermillion dyes; Length to her Brows the Pencil's touch supplies, And with black bending Arches shades her Eyes. Well pleas'd at length the Picture she beholds, And spots it o'er with Artificial Molds; Her Countenance compleat, the Beaux she warms With looks, not hers, and spight of Nature, charms. Thus artfully their Persons they disguise, Till the last Flourish bids the Curtain rise. The Prince then enters on the Stage in State; Behind, a Guard of Candle-Snuffers wait: There swoln with Empire, terrible and fierce, He shakes the Dome, and tears his Lungs with Verse: His Subjects tremble, the Submissive Pit, Wrapt up in Silence and Attention, sit; Till freed at length, he lays aside the Weight Of Publick Business and Affairs of State; Forgets his Pomp, dead to Ambitious Fires, And to some peaceful Brandy-Shop retires; Where in full Gills his anxious thoughts he drowns, And quaffs away the Care that waits on Crowns. The Princess next her pointed Charms displays, Where every Look the Pencil's Art betrays. The Callow Squire at distance feeds his Eyes, And silently for Paint and Patches dies: But if the Youth behind the Scenes retreat, He sees the blended Colours melt with heat, And all the trickling Beauty run in Sweat. The borrow'd Visage he admires no more, And nauseates every Charm he lov'd before: So the same Spear, for double force renown'd, Apply'd the Remedy that gave the Wound. In tedious Lists 'twere endless to engage, And draw at length the Rabble of the Stage, Where one for twenty Years has given Alarms, And call'd contending Monarchs to their Arms; Another fills a more important Post, And rises every other Night a Ghost. Thro the cleft Stage his meager Face he rears, Then stalks along, groans thrice, and disappears; Others with Swords and Shields, the Soldiers Pride, More than a thousand times have chang'd their Side, And in a thousand fatal Battels dy'd. Thus several Persons, several Parts perform; Pale Lovers whine, and blustring Heroes storm. The stern exasperated Tyrants rage, Till the kind Bowl of Poison clears the Stage. Then Honours vanish, and Distinctions cease; Then with Reluctance haughty Queens undress. Heroes no more their fading Laurels boast, And mighty Kings in private Men are lost. He whom such Titles swell'd, such Power made proud, To whom whole Realms, and vanquish'd Nations bow'd, Throws off the gaudy Plume, the Purple Train, And is in Statu quo himself again. The Dream, to Sir Charles Duncomb. On my hard Fate as late I pondring lay, Spent and bow'd down beneath the Toils of Day, By weary Nature to repose constrain'd, I slept at last, and thus in sleep complain'd. Ah Wretch! to this unhappy Clime confin'd, Lost to my Friends, and cut from Human kind; A Clime where gentle Zephyrs never blow, Where frozen Gods keep Court in Ice and Snow. The rigid Winters here come early on, With August brought, and scarce with April gone. In other places Nature looks but bare, Some marks of Spring continue all the Year; But every Winter stript her naked here. The Miry Glebe imprisons Man and Beast, And there must come a Drowth to be releas'd. No Converse does the tedious Hours beguile, But Love and Friendship fly this barbarous Soil. None here for ought but Mammon will repair, And Life has no cessation from its Care. Even Honesty it self is banish'd hence, And Ignorance sets up for Innocence. The Natives are such Brutes, so homely bred, They're of a piece with that on which they tread; Strangers to Virtue, to all Liberal Arts; Their Oxen and their Swine have all their Hearts, Creatures of equal Intellectual Parts. Among each other endless Fewds they sow, And Malice lays Manure to make 'em grow. In Courts and Senates let them strive and jar, Wrangle in Cities, clamour at the Bar. But this is strange e'en in this abject Life, Where Matter fails, to find an equal Strife. No mutual Trust between 'em e'er presides; And Knav'ry follows, when 'tis Interest guides. Thus Slander, Strife, and Spight triumphant reign Among these clumsy Blockheads of the Plain. How vain are all the Tales the Antients told Of a self-teeming Glebe, and of an Age of Gold; Of flowry Shades where Peace supinely reigns? Of faultless Nymphs, and of the faithful Swains? 'Tis all Idea—but by Fancy wrought, The idle Rovings of a wandring Thought. E'en Cowley, who a Rural Life had long Ador'd, and made it Deathless in his Song; When to the Fields he for that Blessing came, Found all their boasted Innocence a Name; And Chertsea stands (to contradict his Rhymes) Blam'd in his Prose to all succeeding times. What Path can here derided Virtue take? What Musick can the sighing Muses make? Without Converse they lose their Force and Fire, And Reason back does to its Spring retire. The long remove from Mirth, from Wit and Arts, Sets us beneath our very natural Parts. If we're not rising, we go down the Hill, For Knowledg knows no mean of standing still. The brightn'd Armour glitters to the Sun, But only using keeps the Polish on. Thus doom'd to Dulness, here I bury'd lye; O low, obscure, inglorious Destiny! My Youth has vainly, idly took its flight, Unknown to Profit, Learning, and Delight. Depriv'd of all that can improve or please, I live in Desarts, yet depriv'd of Ease: Whilst envious Fortune here my Head imploys In barren Labour, and eternal Noise. Depriv'd of London, then too little priz'd, Before I knew the Blessing I despis'd. For Towns, like Tallys, Man for Man does fit, And Wit does keenest whet it self on Wit. Oh Noble City! but too late I mourn My Fortune, banish'd never to return. I would not have it thought, my Wish intends Great Matters—No, free from ambitious Ends: Only a Human Fate my Hope invites, And Innocence, in which my Soul delights. None better cou'd than I contented live With little, or from little more would give. But here I live not, in this Brutal Den Banish'd from Town, from Manners, and from Men. 'Twas here methought a Glorious Form appear'd, Yet Awful, as a Goddess long rever'd. Her Monumental Tower the Skies out-brav'd, And on her Front was fair Augusta grav'd. And why, said she, dost thou thus sighing lye? Why all despondence, yet relief so nigh? He that does set so many Captives free, He will, he must, he shall deliver thee. So bright a Form, Words of such pleasing sound, Oppress with Pleasure, and with Joy confound. The Glorious Shape perceiv'd my deep Amaze, I would have spoke, but I could only gaze. Know'st thou not Me? what Country is there found, What Nation where my Name is not renown'd? Let Vulgar Names, said she, resign to Fate, I can already boast of more than Mortal Date: This privilege the British Glory gives, I'm only then to die, when nothing lives. Quite from the rising to the setting Sun, As vast a Round as his my Fame has run. Let it be either Traffick, Peace or War, What City sends her Naval Tow'rs so far? Who o'er the Ocean so triumphant rides? What Shores are water'd with such wealthy Tides? Beneath my Feet my Thames for ever flows, And for my Profit never takes repose. But shifting Tides to Sea, from Sea to Land, Do our own Stores, and all the World's command: While on her Billows to my Hand she brings The Noblest, Richest, and Remotest things. Tho round my Walls you scarce perceive a Vine, Yet half the Vintage of the Year is mine, And every Lombard Shop an Indian Mine. What other Town do's there so nobly stand For Soil, for Health, for Pleasure and Command? What City do's beside so Lordly rise? And sit so near a Neighbour to the Skies? Who less fears War? and when a War do's cease, Who Richlier does adorn the Arts of Peace? What Sholes of People pour thro every Street! In passing on, what Myriads must you meet! How gay, how richly clad, where'er you come! What gallant Youths, and Beauties in their Bloom! Not brighter shines by night the Milky Way, Than in my Streets the Charming Sex by Day. Who sooner can than I such Sums produce, For self-Magnificence, or Publick Use? Who can her Hand, for Wealth, extend so far, And with such ready Loans defray a War? Loans that to Lewis gave such loud Alarms, He lik'd the Sound worse than the Clank of Arms. He saw in War the Nerves of War increase, He saw, advis'd, and straight consents to Peace. But herein most I pride; this Wealth, these Powers No Mercenary Troops defend, no Towers Rise up in my Defence, my Safety's found Within my self; no Ditches here surround My Walls; my Thames flows freely in her Bed, To no forc'd Channels like a Captive led. Freedom in all, in every Part appears, Choice gives the Sway in all succeeding Years. Amongst our selves we raise the Good, the Wise, Virtue and Labour make the Chosen rise. Kings of some Empires want our Wealth, our Power A Duncomb lends a Million in an Hour. Our Wealth the Spanish Indies does uphold, And from our Iron Mines we send them Gold. Yet Kings receive but what the People give; They make him rich, and yet in plenty live. They name the Sum, and we forestal the Day; Others less quick to take, than We to pay. Augusta this great Blessing gives, that she Makes all her Sons not only Rich, but Free. Thou know'st me now, believe what I impart, I've nam'd the Man shall raise thy drooping Heart. Stay then no longer thus lamenting here, But hope a milder Heav'n, and kinder Air, The rising of thy better Stars are near. Once were thy Shades e'en with his Presence blest, When Thee, e'en Thee, he singl'd from the rest; And kindly smiling on thy Rural Lays, Crown'd them at once both with Reward and Praise. 'Tis He I mean, who does our Captives free From more than an Egyptian Slavery: 'Tis he, that shall at last provide for Thee. 'Tis he that everlasting Honour gains By Nobly striking off my Debtors Chains. Husbands He to their Wives again does give; He heard their Dying Cries, and bids 'em live. So Mighty Paul, and Silas, when they were Imprison'd, pray'd, and found the Angel there: The Shackles broke, the Doors all open flew; But Duncomb's Angel stoops not to so few. At every Prison, at every Jayl does call, And, like an Act of Grace, he manumits them all. 'Twas here she paus'd, smiling with such a Grace, No Furrow seen, no Wrinkle in her Face. The Awful Dread, which first my Senses strook, Dissolv'd to Pleasure by her Charming Look. Let Cheating Priests use little Arts to fright, But why should Poets their false Fictions write? Clad in a Stygian Vest, with scatter'd Locks, The raving Priestess Heav'nly Power invokes. Black Fumes arise, and from the trembling Ground, Sad Murmurs, breaking thro' the Temple, sound: And Flames from the unkindled Altars rise, As rais'd by Magick Songs, with horrid Cries. Such the Contrivances by Priests of old, When Pious Stories to the Crowd they told. Thus Hell and Horror to the Gods they join, And make them Terrible, to be Divine. Poets no more let Verse and Truth dispute, Nor Human Crimes to Deities impute. Let Tyrants choose to govern Men by Fear, The Gods are gentle, but Mankind severe. Not so Augusta: For She, the Glorious Genius of our Isle, Softn'd her Godhead with a Human Smile. I found the Heav'nly Vision gave Consent; So poor a Bard might give his Passion vent. Encourag'd thus, I gently rais'd my Voice: Say, Goddess, how our Sh'riff became the Choice Of crowding Throngs, who echoing his Name, Did him their Darling Magistrate proclaim. Say, Goddess, how does he become your Theme, That Name so lately injur'd in Extreme? An Envious Race I know his Ruin sought, Declare then how the mighty Change was wrought. Th'Effect must spring from some Stupendous Cause, Where Fair Augusta gives such vast Applause. As Stormy Nights and dark Eclipses may Set greater Value on succeeding Day: So Malice raging without Rule or Form, Exalted him, and rais'd him by the Storm. Easie, and Rich, in Innocence secure, He would not bend with little Arts, procure Success to Projects hatch'd against the State, Nor help th'Exchequer Cheat, but met his Fate, Braving the Faction, and their utmost Hate. Unseasonable Virtue out of time, Was Duncomb's Fault, and that his only Crime. He knowing well the narrow self Design, Shunning base Profit, did his Place resign. But this the bold Projectors could not bear; He must be guilty, that themselves may share, With double Joy, the Vengeance and the Prize, Two thirds their Avarice could scarce suffice. Thro thick and thin the Furious Leaders drive, Set raging out, and like a Storm arrive. These ruin'd, fall, and others prostrate yield, And wide Destruction covers all the Field. Orphans lament, the desolate Widow weeps, Thousands undone, and yet the Nation sleeps. Here human Malice might it self display, And many dark Designs expose to Day. Here painted to the Life, the haughty Crew Might in true Colours be expos'd to view. But I forbear, nor shall their Rage inspire A Heav'nly Breast with like ill-natur'd Fire. Let this suffice, expect the happy Day. When all the Birds of Night and those of Prey Shall to the Deserts fly, to make the Virtuous Way. It is enough I disappoint their Aim, Secure the Guiltless in their Wealth and Fame, And fix in Honour Duncomb's injur'd Name. Such is the Temper of an English Soul, It yields to Softness, but abhors Controul. The frighted World all arm'd in his Defence, Who either had good Nature or good Sense. Tir'd with their Spite, and all their Hopes o'erpast To ruin him, they left the Chase at last, But sullenly, just as the Bear withdraws, The Lamb redeem'd that fill'd his griping Paws. By the known Laws he did himself acquit, Rescu'd by Heav'n from Malice, and from Wit, From Bribes, and Power, from the devouring Jaw Of nigh Oppression, to take place as Law. The City sensible, what Men conspire Against his Innocence, they soon took fire; Touch'd with his Sufferings, knowing his Desert, All with one Voice, unanimous in Heart, My Sons advance him to the Shrieval Name, Where now he honours That, and gives the Nation Fame. Our Royal Master by this time was come, As late with Laurel, crown'd with Olive, home. Never of all our Martial Kings, from Heav'n To Britain has there yet a Prince been given, Who sooner did in Camps arrive at Fame, Or past more Dangers to a deathless Name. Nor did the shining Chase of Glory cease, Till he had crown'd his Martial Toils with Peace. The Hero's Heat drives no cool Thought away, His People long for Peace, without delay He gloriously procures the wish'd for Day. Plenty and Safety, with their brooding Wings Extended wide, produce all useful things; In Peace the Plowman reaps, in Peace the Poet sings. To happy England had not Fate decreed, That from that Glorious Pair none should succeed, So much th'expecting World seem'd to require, From Mary's Virtue, and from Nassau's Fire. Nature, deficient to so great a Task, Would nothing give, when we too much did ask. We were ungrateful for the present Store, Worthless of what we had, yet craving more. Those who from Tyranny redeem the Land, In Fame's large Temple shall for ever stand. Greater than they, whose Conquest Trophies rear, Such the Camilli, such the Decii were: Whose Names in Story are more sacred far Than theirs, who happy in Invasive War, Brought Western Gold, and Eastern Spices home; These were admir'd, but those belov'd in Rome. This Glorious King returning to our Isle, Receiv'd th'intended Martyr with a Smile; Pleas'd to bestow on injur'd Innocence Favours, which leave to Malice no pretence. Whom the King honours, and the People chuse, To such a one who can Applause refuse, Fit for the Praises of the chastest Muse? Let then his unjust Sufferings be repaid By Praises due, for since my Walls were laid, Never a Subject more befriended Trade. Who in his Office ever rais'd so high AUGUSTA's Name for Hospitality? What Table thro the Nation does afford So vast a Plenty as his Shrieval Board? Who for all sorts so fitly does prepare? The Great, the Poor are equally his Care; And Wit and Vertue still are welcome there. Mean while the sparkling Wines around him move, Th'Inspiring Nectar which the Muses love. Who e'er the City's Interest studied more, Or better Laws propos'd to feed the Poor? Nor does he, splitting on the common Shelf, Propose to others, what he shuns himself. To give by Driblets (which is chiefly done) Is but to keep the Needy starving on. He lays out his Relief at nobler Rates, His Dole's a Market, and his Gifts Estates. I here had answer'd, but the Dame withdrew, And with her Sleep retir'd, and left me too; But left th'Impression deep upon my Mind Of Duncomb honour'd, and Augusta kind. Forgive me, Sir, if thus opprest with Spleen, I treat you with this Visionary Scene: Nor let the Muses lose me your Esteem, Since they petition only but in a Dream: In Dreams they live, and chiefly Dreams regard, But most they err, when dreaming of Reward. But tho my Sleep dissents, I waking near Upon that Subject, shall offend your Ear. These Melancholy Vapours bred at sight Of Winter, with the Spring will take their flight, When op'ning Sweets, and universal Green, Produce a Gay Inimitable Scene. Tho now with Rains, and blighting Blasts we strive, That Glorious Season will again revive. The Tuneful Choir thro every Field and Grove, Will then renew their Musick, and their Love. With them th'Exulting Muse her Voice shall raise; And waking then, I'll sing my Patron's Praise. The British Muse: Or Tyranny expos'd. A Satyr, Occasion'd by all the Fulsom and Lying Poems and Elegies, that have been written on the Death of the Late King James. For Tyrants dead no Statues we erect, Or sumptuous Fanes with sable Mourning deckt; No weeping Eyes the joyful Country drown, But all rejoice to hear the Tyrant's gone: For Slaves have Freedom, when the Tyrant's dead, And do around their gawdy Ensigns spread. England, rejoice! thy slavish Fears are past: The Tyrant's dead, who was thy worst and last. Encircl'd he's within the Shades of Night, Confin'd far distant from the Realms of Light: No more thy Liberties he shall invade, Subvert thy Laws, and undermine thy Trade. Whilst impious Pens usurp illegal Fame, And Honours give to his detested Name, My British Muse in justest Notes shall sing A Bankrupt Monarch, and a Tyrant King. Let Flaming London first appear in view, And his good Actions and his Virtues shew, Whose Houses he into a Bonfire turn'd, And sacred Temples with like Zeal he burn'd; Pleas'd with the Sight, as the great City fell, He and his Priests carous'd and drank to Hell. Thus Nero Rome by Fire in Ashes laid, Laugh'd at the Flames, and as they burnt he play'd. Proceed, my Muse, shew Martyrs round his Herse, Who in loud Yells their Injuries express; Murder'd yet unreveng'd by British Hands, The dire Effect of his unjust Commands. First strangl'd Godfrey slides from Scenes of Light, A pale thin Ghost would even Fiends afright. Then College, first destroy'd by Popish Rage, The Loss and Scandal of that Impious Age: His Ghost may well attend his Funeral, And on his Soul for heavy Vengeance call. His Name to Oxford a due Scandal bears, Thro a vast Series of succeeding Years. When Time shall truly the sad Story tell, How its lewd Priests combin'd with Rome and Hell, To murder him who for their Freedoms strove, And did for them a bloody Victim prove; Yet sporting with his Death, were glad to see A College added to their University: Hang'd, drawn and quarter'd by Tyrannick Sway, Which Passive Priests taught People to obey, Till they themselves in Popish Blankets tost By their lov'd James, another College lost. Lord! how their passive Cannons then did roar! And their Report reach'd to the Belgic Shoar: Then all grew Active, Passive were no more. Next murder'd Essex to his Herse does come, Sent by a bloody Razor to his Tomb. Then noblest Russel does augment the Throng, And in a Decent Terror slides along: Manly yet meek; his even Temper was Crown'd both with moral Virtues, and with Grace: Yet by the Ax of Rome's curst Butcher fell A Sacrifice to bloody James and Hell. He shew'd his numerous Wounds, and groan'd the rest, And then withdrew to Regions of the Blest. Next Glorious Sidney at his Herse appears, Murder'd by James in his declining Years; The Martyr's Fate did crown his hoary Hairs. No better Man his Family did grace, Nor had more Virtues of a Nobler Race. No Man his Country's Freedom better knew, Or in its Cause a Sword more faithful drew. No Man with greater Courage ever fought, Or for our Freedoms with more Learning wrote. Learning and Parts are but a weak Defence, And Tyrants still wage War with Wit and Sense. Cornish the best good Man Augusta knew, With pleasant Terror does the Mourning view. And that the Scene a Female should not want, To grace the Rear comes up our murder'd Gaunt: All to their Graves by Popish Murder thrust. Was this, you lying Bards, your James the Just? As in the Waters we do Fishes find, Which do devour and prey upon their Kind; This Princely Shark on his own Species fed, When Cause requir'd, and Rome the Order made. Thus Coleman to his Jaws a Victim fell, Sent in a Jugler's Box to plot in Hell. Vain Wretch! who could so fatally believe A Man enclin'd by Nature to deceive. With him what Wretches would the Scepter trust, And blasphemously call him James the Just? Nay, his own Brother, Partner in his Blood, With poisonous Visage o'er his Coffin stood: For James (when many Murders he had done) Poison'd his Brother to ascend his Throne; Then from his People and his Country fled, The two good Acts this wicked Prince e'er did. But now a Troop of grizly Ghosts appear, And grinning pale are all approaching near: Numerous they were, and all besmear'd with Blood, With dismal Horror round his Coffin stood; They slid along, and interchanging Ground, Roar'd out his Obsequies in hollow Sound. Who murder'd in the West at his Command, A noble Train of slaughter'd Patriots stand: Some beardless Youths slain by his Tyrant Rage, And some declining by decrepid Age. Such beauteous Youths might some Compassion move In Bloody Tyrants, and might force their Love: Some Pity Age (for Age has also Charms) Might move in Tyrants, and secure from Harms. But James, of all the Tyrant Race accurst, Begot by Tygers, and by Vipers nurst, Nor Age nor Sex could his Compassion move, Nor yet the Judgments of Almighty Jove. Oh had I now, by Heaven's impartial Laws, A Power sufficient to revenge your Cause, My dearest murder'd Friends! whole Troops should fall By my just Hand to grace your Funeral; Yet Heaven some weak Revenge does still afford, Admits the Pen, when it denies the Sword. Were but my Pen sharp-pointed as your Steel, When you on Sedgmore Parracides did kill, I'd raise a Monument to future Times, And hang up Villains in exalted Rhymes. When publick Justice is grown deaf and blind, And Criminals no rightful Sentence find, Each honest Man should his Resentment show, And mark the Path where Justice ought to go. That Justice did not Jefferies destroy, Does more our Wonder than our Sense imploy: He who by Blood climb'd to the top of State, And grew by Murders insolent and great: To him blind Justice no due Halter gave, But unreveng'd he found a common Grave. Kirk did not by the Hand of Justice fall, He liv'd a Villain, died a General. Such the Catastrophe of our strange Times, Preferment rises from enormous Crimes. Can e'er our Land those bloody Scenes forget, That Western Massacre not question'd yet? In which the bravest English Blood was spilt, Without a Sacrifice t'atone the Guilt: Where better Men than future Times will see, By Cowards murder'd, hung on every Tree. Had I but then this Body laid aside, And with my dear, my happy Partners dy'd, I had with them my Share of Bliss possest, And now been number'd with th'Immortal Blest; Had upwards soar'd, and tow'ring left behind My youthful Limbs expos'd to Heat and Wind; Of Life's great Burden had been surely eas'd, And not the Number of my Sins encreas'd; Had ne'er been quell'd by Times important Rage, And known the Slights of an Ungrateful Age. But Man contrives not his own Destiny, And cannot, when he pleases, live or die. Since Heav'n allows me Life against my Will, And still I upwards climb the steepy Hill, Good God! forbid my Sands in vain should pass, And no good Actions grace my sinking Glass. Tyrants I hated from my very Youth, But always lov'd the Glorious Cause of Truth. To English Laws I still Allegiance paid, And never yet a Tyrant King obey'd, But such who legally the Scepter sway'd. Speak, Satyr! speak! and let thy Notes be heard By trembling Tyrants, of thy Lash afraid! Thy Task is Noble, and thy Theme's Divine: Let Satyr speak, and bite in every Line! And kill more surely than the Sword or Shot, 'Till the loath'd Name of TYRANT be forgot. TYRANT! that thing accurst, ally'd to Hell, Where Tyrant Kings in flaming Sulphur dwell. The dreadful Tophet was ordain'd of old, Tyrannick Princes and their Slaves to hold. Tyrants and Slaves we both together join, And in one dark Abyss do both confine: For Slaves are Panders to a Tyrant's Lust, And ravish Liberty by Force unjust; Therefore o'er both the Heav'nly Powers prevail, To damn them all in one Eternal Jail. TYRANT! the very Name so heats my Blood, My Veins scarce stop the Torrent of its Flood: A Freeman's Rage can scarce my Sense command, My Pen does tremble underneath my Hand. Was every Atom of my Flesh a Man, As brave as ever to the Battel ran, I round the Orb would Tyrant Kings pursue, And even Godlike Brutus would out-do. First into France I would my Army lead, And strike its proud and haughty Tyrant dead, The vilest Wretch did e'er a Scepter sway, Or e'er a wretched People did obey; By Blood and Poison manages Intrigues, And breaks like Cobwebs, solemn Pacts and Leagues: Whose sacred Oaths are broken o'er and o'er, His Faith is found in every carted Whore. Him I'd depose, from his own Rack would send His guilty Soul to his Infernal Friend, His Faithful Friend whose Counsel still he took, And ne'er with him the dark Alliance broke. I'd make his Slaves by my just Fury free, And treat them with the Sweets of Liberty: I'd pull his Vassals from his Tyrant Paws, And reinstate 'em in their Rights and Laws. The little Bastard he of late proclaim'd As King of England, shou'd with him be damn'd; Tho England, fearless of the Gallick Hope, Defies the French, their Bastard, and the Pope: And if the Brat be James the Second's Son, Like his dear Dad he'll from the Battel run; His Nose will bleed engag'd in Wars Design, He'll scamper, like his Father from the Boyn. Suppose the Brat to be Legitimate, How can it mend or alter England's Fate? Mend it cannot, but may disturb our Fate; Lewis a devilish Cobler is of State. Nor can the English, who are bold and strong, Fear one who from a Race of Cowards sprung. Yet shou'd my Army the young Cub destroy, And with the grizly Tyrant kill the Boy: And Heaven does sometimes the same Measures take, Destroys the Horse for the lewd Rider's sake. Next into Savoy I my Coast would steer, And play the Devil with the Traitor there. That little Duke, yet mighty Tyrant, I Would blow like Rockets mounting to the Sky; I would revenge his Treason in the War, And make him of a Tyrant's Fortune share: The brave Vaudois their Country should enjoy, And help their bloody Tyrant to destroy. Then to compleat my Brave and Just Design, I would my Forces with Prince Eugene join. Monsieurs and Dons the self-same Fate should find, As Clouds retiring from the potent Wind. Spaniards enslav'd I would with Freedom bless, Augment their Ease, and make their Thraldom less: Their treacherous Nobles I'd severely drub, Home to his Sire would send their Tyrant Cub. To Austria's House I'd leave the Spanish Crown, If they would grant the Natives what's their own; But if they rob'd 'em of their Rights and Health, I'd turn old Spain into a Commonwealth. And e'er I sheath'd my just revenging Steel, Porto Carero should its sharpness feel: Crowding I'd send to Hell among the rest, That damn'd Tyrannick Villain of a Priest. Tyrant and Priest in the same Yoke do draw, One damns the Gospel, t'other damns the Law. 'Tis fit that he who built a Tyrant's Throne, And has by Forgery a Land undone, Who to his Country did such Ills create, Should share of Tyrants the Impartial Fate. Thus having in the South declar'd my Worth, I'd face about, and march my Army North: The Polish Tyrant should my Vengeance feel, And downwards fall beneath my fatal Steel. The rav'nous Lion Tyrant of the Wood Does claim Succession for his serine Brood: But no Succession crown'd the Polish Bear; For every Tyrant is elected there. Ye Polish Slaves, trapan'd into a Choice, How ill your Cause sutes with your Peoples Voice? Who could so madly for themselves elect A Tyrant, and their Liberties neglect. To get a Crown he did forsake his God, And justly proves to Fools a Scourge and Rod. Great Sweden's King, I'd then revenge thy Cause, And rescue Saxony from Poland's Claws, This done, I'd march against the beastly Czar, A Shame to Princes, and a Fool in War: With numerous Hosts he other Lands invades, But soon retires to Fastnesses and Shades; Vanquish'd by Sweden's Youth, he wildly flies, And not on Prowess, but on Flight relies. Thus Tyrants fight, and like a Tyrant he Should from my Hand receive his Destiny: More Wounds than Brutus Tyrant Cæsar gave, From my revenging Steel this Beast should have, Lest the curst Hydra should cement again, And plague his People in a longer Reign. My Labours finish'd, I would return home, And tell of Tyrants the impartial Doom. My Native Land's a Nation Free and Brave, That hates the odious Title of a Slave: As poisonous Toads are kill'd by Irish Air, So bloody Tyrants can't inhabit here, But thrive like Plants in hot Arabia's Sand, And soon a dry and wither'd Stalk they stand. Freeman and Slave inconsisteant things, And one the other to Destruction brings. England's the Fortunate, the Happy Isle, With Freedom blest, and with a fruitful Soil, Whose Laws and Freedoms just and righteous are, And every Man, the meanest, has his Share. Here shall my Muse to after Ages sing The Bravest People, and the Happiest King. On the Promoted Bishops. 1691. 1 For the Miracles done This Year Ninety one Let's go forth and proclaim a Thanksgiving; Late Archbishop we sing To the Tune of Late King, While J? and old S?ft are living. 2 Of this Protestant Land The Fleet not half mann'd, Is a Miracle scarce worth our Trouble: We judg of the Weight Of this Politick State, Now the Church and the Throne carry double. 3 The Law now in force Made a solemn Divorce Between J? C? and his Church has; 'Twill a Miracle show, As the blessed Times go, If Religion proves worth a Year's Purchase. 4 The Gospel now thrives For our Lord hath two Wives, And a Prelate his See of each Party: That the Law doth respect The new B?ps Elect, Or the new second Wife of Clancarty. 5 As to the Pastoral Staff, We at T?n laugh, And the Projects of dull Politicians; Spite of all Satan's Power, Aaron's Rod shall devour The Rod of those Heathen Magicians. 6 Our impotent Fleet Our starv'd Army may greet, And at each others Confidence wonder; With an Army unpaid, And a Navy betray'd, We fast to keep Great Lewis under. 7 As old Babylon faith, The Protestant Faith Tooke deep root form the Codpiece of Harry: We good Witness can bring, The new Bishops all spring From the Conducts of W? and M?. A Ballad on the Confederates; in Imitation of Ratcliff Ramble. A number of Pr?s, tho poor ones 'tis true, In Confederacy join'd the French to undo, But if they should fail, then wo to the Crew of Banditti. All snotty and snorting, like Horse that had Glanders, All tattered they form the Mob of Commanders, All poorer than Job were got into Flanders, 'tis pity. To conquer the French King is not their Design, Tho that's their Pretence, but to drink up his Wine; 'Tis a Liquor, they say, will make them Divine, to their Glory. If a Peasant that's drunk is as great as a King, Then what is a Prince, a very fine thing, And a Number of Princes will make the World ring with a Story. In a Council of War these Tatterdemallions Having drunk off their Wine not by Quarts but by Gallons; Who tho not fit for Soldiers are very good Stallions, what d'ye think, Sir? Considering their Number, to make all things sure, A desperate Disease wants a desperate Cure, We will instantly raise the Siege of Namure: first let's drink, Sir. They boast and they brag that we have a thing, Some call him a P?, some call him a K?, However he's something, Hey Ding a Ding ding, to the matter. We'll beat them by Sea, and we'll beat them by Land It is a Royal Descent, you must understand, To ruin the French, and unpeople the Land, not to flatter. At the French as yet you've no reason to jeer us: For if you consider the Battel of Flerus, You have little mind any more to come near us: so good-morrow. Besides you well know too when Mons was a taking, Each Prince that looks big now did then fall a shaking, And found its Relief was a mad undertaking, to their Sorrow. Nay further, your Courage did plainly appear, When politick Æsop fell foul on the Rear, And cut off ten thousand; then Princes stand clear, was the Word, Sir. Your Cities are taken, your Armies are beat, Namure is our own, now sound a Retreat, And brag of what Mischief you've done to our Fleet, not a T?, Sir. CURSE, 1690. Curs'd be the Stars which did ordain Queen Bess a Maiden Life should reign; Married she might have brought an Heir, Nor had we known a S?t here. Curs'd be the Tribe who at Whitehall Slew one o'th' Name, and slew not all. Curs'd be the Second, who took Gold From France, and Britain's Honour sold: But curs'd of all be J? the last, The worst of Kings, of Fools the best. And doubly cursed be those Knaves, Who out of Loyalty would make us Slaves. Curs'd be the Clergy who desire The French to bring in James the Squire, And save your Church so as by fire. Curst be the Earl of T?ton, Who almost had three Lands undone; Who out of Fear, of Pride, or Gain, Betray'd our Land, and lost her Main. Curs'd be the Ministers of State, Who keep our Fleet till 'tis too late; Who have six Weeks the Cause disputed, When the Whole in two might have recruited. Curs'd be the Name of English-man, To curse it more live T?ton. Let Resolution only be King William's noble Property: He hath done what we ne'er could do, Ill to himself, to us been true, Prove that among us, and curse me too. Answer to the Prophecy, As when the Knight, &amp;c. When J? and his Army shall run from the Boyne, And England stand blest to the altering their Coin; When Plots laid in Hell can never succeed, But the Traytors found out and lopt like a Weed; When thy Armies desert thee for want of their Pay, And those that don't run thou forcest away; When the Fleets play Bopeep, and sculks up and down, And dares not make head like a Fleet of Renown; When old Age shall seize thee, and thy Senses decay And thy Counsels of Priestcraft shall lead the wrong way Then, Lewis, I tell thee thou'rt a cursed damn'd Tool Thus to be expos'd for the sake of a Fool: When the Weight is too heavy in oppressing the Land That every Man is mark'd with want in his Hand. On the Exchequer Bills. Pray Sir, did you hear of a late Proclamation, To send Paper for Payment quite thro the Nation Yes, Sir, I have, they're your M?e's Notes, Tinctur'd and colour'd by our Parliament Votes: But it is plain on the People to be but a Jest, They go by the Carrier, and come by the Post. A Ballad on the Poll-Act. A Poll and Land-Tax are now coming forth, For our Deliverance they travel in Birth, But 'tis to pay for a thing more than it's worth, Which no body can deny. To pay our just Taxes was once thought too much, But now Extraordinary Charity is such, We bankrupt our selves for maintaining the D?; Which, &amp;c. A Tax for the Land, and a Poll for the Head, In this both the Houses justly agreed, For our Estates and our Heads are all forfeited; Which, &amp;c. If we tax or poll on for a Year or two more, The French I dare say will ne'er touch on our Shore, For fear of the Charge of maintaining the Poor; Which, &amp;c. Seeing nothing is done, for a Quarterly Poll Is like taking Physick which gives one no Stool, Make the Doctor a Knave, and the Patient a Fool; Which, &amp;c. Since it is for Religion we make such ado, There's no way to prove our Pretensions true, Like parting with our Gold and Consciences too. Which no body can deny. A Panegyrick, 1696–7. The attribution of this poem is questionable. Hail happy W?, thou art strangely great, What is the Cause, thy Virtue of thy Fate? For thee the Child the Parents Hearts will sting, For thee the Favorite will desert his King; For thee the Patriot will subvert the Laws, For thee the Judg will still decide the Cause; For thee the Prelate will the Church betray, For thee the Soldier fights without his Pay; For thee the Freeman mortgages his Hold, For thee the Miser lavishes his Gold; For thee the Merchant loses all his Store, For thee the Tradesman is content and poor; For thee the Senate our best Laws suspend, And will make any new to serve thy End: The chief Design of all their Loyal Votes, Is to invent new Ways, new Means and Plots. No Credit in the Land but thine will pass, Nor ready Mony if it want thy Face. Thy Loyal Slaves love thy Oppression more, Than all their Wealth and Liberty before. For thee and Tyranny they all declare, And beg the Blessing of Eternal War. And that this Wonder may more wondrous seem, Thou never yet didst one kind thing for them. Rebels like Witches having sign'd the Rolls, Must serve their Masters, tho they damn their Souls. On the Earl of Castlemain's Embassy to Rome in King James II. Reign. 1687. Let Mighty Cæsar not disdain to view These Emblems of his Power and Goodness too. A short Essay, but fraught with Cæsar's Fame, And shews how distant Courts esteem his Name. Here may'st thou see thy wondrous Fortune trac'd; With Sufferings first, and then with Empire grac'd: Long toss'd with Storms on Faction's swelling Tide, Thy Conduct and thy Constancy was try'd; As Heaven design'd thy Vertue to proclaim, And shew the Crown deserv'd before it came. Troy's Hero thus, when Troy could stand no more, Urg'd by the Fates to leave his native Shore, With restless Toil on Land and Seas was toss'd, E'er he arriv'd the fair Lavinian Coast. Thus Maro did his mighty Hero feign, Augustus claim'd the Character in vain, Which Britain's Cæsar only can sustain. Permit, dread Sir, my Muse, tho mean, to own A Truth to Albion and to Europe known: You are what Virgil feign'd his Prince to be, Your Valour such, and such your Piety. Now Theseus Deeds we can receive for true, And Hercules was but a Type of you: He made the fierce Lernean Monster bleed. From Hydra Faction you have Albion freed. The paths of Glory trod, and Dangers past, Just Heaven allows a peaceful Throne at last: At home to shew th'Indulgence of a God, And send your peaceful Ministers abroad. While Palmer hastens to the Roman Court, (And fraught with Worth that Honour to support) His glorious Train and passing Pomp to view, (A Pomp that ev'n to Rome it self was new) Each Age, each Sex the Latian Turrets fill'd, Each Age and Sex in Tears of Joy distill'd: While Wonder them to Statues did convert; And those e'en seem'd, that were the works of Art, Emblems and Figures of such Life and Force, As wanting Speech, did to the Eye discourse, And shew, what was despair'd in Ages past, An universal Language found at last. Hail Palmer, Hail illustrious Minister! To Cæsar, Britain, Fame, and Virtue dear; Cæsar to represent, Great Cæsar's Voice Nam'd Castlemain; the British Shores rejoice, And Tyber's Banks applaud great Cæsar's Choice. How therefore could the Muses silent be, And none can want a Muse that writes of thee! From thine, not Phebus Tree, my Song I'll raise, And crown'd with Palm, I will contemn the Bays. On King William's Statue at Dublin in Memory of the Victory at the Boyne, July 1st, 1690. Monumentum Ære perennius. How Nobly did our grateful City join To represent King William at the Boyne; And yet their Statue (we must all confess) Tho it speaks Dublin great, makes William less: For where are Heaps of slain, where Streams of Blood? Where does it shew how Guardian Angels stood, Watching to turn aside the fatal Ball, And in one Royal Person sav'd us all? Where may we see the dreadful Scombergh lost, And William routing all that trembling Host, Which once did like the fam'd Armado boast? He could no less in just Revenge intend, Than such a General Fall for such a Friend. Where do we see them all disorder'd fly, As if their safety in their Heels did lie, And they would basely live, not bravely die? The Artist knew no Skill could fully shew That Conquest, all to his bold Conduct owe. No Hand can make his warlike Spirit known To long succeeding Ages, but his own; And when all Brass consumes, all Marbles wast, Great Nassau's Glories, and the Boyne shall last. On the Countess of Dor??????r Mistress to King J????? II. 1680. By the Earl of D?????. 1 Tell me, Dormida, why so gay, Why such Embroidery, Fringe, and Lace? Can any Dresses find a way To stop the Approaches of Decay, And mend a ruin'd Face? 2 Wilt thou still sparkle in the Box, And ogle in the Ring? Canst thou forget the Age and Pox? Can all that shines on Shells and Rocks Make thee a fine young thing? 3 So have I seen in Larder dark Of Veal a lucid Loin, Repleat with many hellish Spark, As wise Philosophers remark, At once both stink and shine. A Psalm sung the 30th of January, 1696. At the C????s? H???d Club. 1 There was a K? of a S?h Race, A Man of Muckle Might, He never was seen in a Battel great, But greatly he would sh?. This K? begat another K?, Which made the Nation sad, Was of the same Religion, A Papist, with his Dad. 2 This Monarch wore a pecked Beard, And scorn'd a doughty Hero; As Dioclesian insolent, And merciful as Nero. The Churches darling Implement, But Scourge of all the People, He swore he'd make each Mother's Son Adore their Idols Steeple. 3 But they perceiving his Design, Grow plaguy shy and jealous, And fairly cut his C? H? off, And sent him to his Fellows. Old R?y did succeed his Dad, Such a King was never seen; He'd f? with every common Drab, But seldom with his Queen. 4 Restless and hot, about he roll'd The Town from Whore to Whore; A Monarch merry he lived, But scandalous and poor. His Dogs would sit at Council-Board Like Judges in their Furs; We question much who had most Sense, The Master or the Curs. 5 At last he dy'd we know not how, But some say by his Brother; His Soul to Royal Tophet went To see his Dad and Mother: Then furious J? usurp'd the Throne, To pull Religion down; But by his Wife and Priests undone, He quickly lost the Crown. 6 To France the wandring Bigot trudg'd In hopes Relief to find, Which he is like to have from thence, E'en when the Devil is blind. O how should we rejoice and pray, And never cease to sing, If B?ps too were cast away, And banish'd with their K?! Then Peace and Plenty would ensue Our Bellies would be full; Then we would laugh and smile, As in the Days of Noll. An Answer to a Jacobite Panegyrick upon Sorrel. Insulting Ass! Who basely couldst revile The Guardian Angel of our wretched Isle; Who now retiring from the Scenes of Wars, Is known and number'd 'midst the shining Stars! Perform'd a Work, which when he was below, None but a Soul like his cou'd undergo. Britons enslav'd, he did with Freedom bless, And broke the Chains their shackl'd Legs did press. Belgia he did protect, and sav'd its Land; And made in Awe the Gallic Tyrant stand: He mark'd the Way to make all Europe Free, And gave the Mortal Wound to Slavery. Too soon, alas! Too soon this Monarch fell! Yet after Ages shall his Honour tell; When Britain feels his Loss, its Natives shall In vain to Heav'n for such a Monarch call. For ever be that stumbling Beast accurst; Got by a Tory, by a Devil nurst. And may for ever that unlucky Steed Only on Briars and on Thistles feed. On the Expedition to Cales under the D. of Ormond. 1702. Whether by Sea our mighty Ormond flies, Or else encamp'd on Foreign Lands he lies, May still Propitious Fate his Arms attend, Still may the Gods, and Fortune be his Friend! Let England's Genius guide him in the War, Let him the Darling of the Gods appear! May Conquest still attend the British Sword, And Barren Lands Triumphant Wreaths afford: May English Valour, like the Sun disperse Its martial Rays thro the whole Universe. Let England's Fame, like the last Trumpets, sound From Sea to Sea, from Pole to Pole rebound: May trembling Nations, when the sound they hear, Submit, and supplicate the God of War. England's the Land with greatest Freedom blest, Which Blessing she would give to all the rest. Thus Mighty William (who her Scepter sway'd, And whom all Men, but abject Slaves obey'd) When He his Albion had from Bondage freed, And all good Men, and Heaven approv'd the Deed; Europe Enslav'd he did with Pity view, And griev'd for men, who Freedom never knew. Shall I (said He) One Nation only Save? Why should not others the same Freedom have? What tho the Wretches do themselves enthral? Compassion is a Tribute due to All: I'll break their Bonds, and set all Europe Free, And every Slave shall tast of Liberty. Belgia with Albion strictly is Ally'd; In both their Powers I firmly can Confide: Before their Force what Tyrant Foe can stand? And who'l want Conquest, does such Men Command? Bravely resolv'd, as bravely He pursu'd, And had e'er this each Tyrant King subdu'd; But Heav'n esteem'd what He'd already done, Who justly Merited a better Throne: And so from Toil remov'd Him to his Rest, T'augment the Number of th'Immortal Blest. Thus some Wise Architect Foundation lays Of a great Work would aggrandize his Praise; Which e'er accomplish'd he his Race has run, And leaves Unfinish'd what he had Begun: When some good Artist, building on his Fame, With him obtains an Everlasting Name. William! the Mighty William laid the Scene; He did the Work of Liberty begin; He first attack'd the Grizly Foe, and gave Aim to the People would their Freedoms save. Where he left off, our Ormond does begin; He is to finish the Illustrious Scene. May all the Heav'nly Powers with Him Combine, And Bless His Arms, as William's at the Boyne. Several Copys of Verses on her Majesty's and the Prince's going to Oxford. The first by Mr. Harcourt, Son to Sir Simon Harcourt, Sollicitor General to Her Majesty. To the QUEEN at Her coming to Christ-Church. When haughty Monarchs their proud State expose, And Majesty an awful Greatness shews; Their Subjects, Madam, with amazement seiz'd, Gaze at the Pomp, rather surpriz'd than pleas'd. But your more gentle Influence imparts Wonder at once, and Pleasure to our Hearts. Where'er you come Joy shines in ev'ry Face; Such winning Goodness, such an easy Grace, Through all your Realms diffusive Kindness pours, That ev'ry English Heart's entirely yours. The Muses Sons with eager transport view Their long desponding Hopes reviv'd in You, The Muses Sons to Monarchy ever true. These happy Walls by Royal Bounty plac'd, Often with Royal Presence have been grac'd. Here Kings to ease the Cares attend a Crown, Preferr'd the Muses Laurels to their Own. And here You once enjoy'd a safe Retreat, From Noise and Envy free: To this lov'd Seat, To be a Guest, You then did condescend, Which now, its happy Guardian, You defend. Oxford, with Joy, beholds the Royal Pair, And finds her Muses are her Prince's Care: May we presume to claim a nearer Tye; They are your Subjects, We Your Family. Accept the Duty then we doubly Owe, We share your Presence and Protection too. So, when Great Jove within the Country Cell Of humble pious Baucis meant to dwell, The bounteous God grac'd her with Gifts Divine, And where he found his Refuge, fix'd his Shrine. To the PRINCE, at his coming to Christ-Church. Spoke by Mr. Cowslade. And You, Auspicious Prince, our other Care, Accept the Duty which Your Isis pays, Whether in Arts of Peace, or Deeds of War, The Hero justly claims the Muses praise. Aspiring Youth, fir'd with a generous Flame, The Tracts of Princely Vertues here persue; At once both copy, and admire Your Fame, And all their different Aims unite in You. One, bloody Sieges, and feign'd Camp designs, And fancied Schemes of future Actions draws, And early in imaginary Times, Defends his Countries, and his Prince's Cause. Others the milder Arts of Phæbus chuse, And to smooth Numbers form their tuneful Tongue, From You begin, to You direct their Muse, The Subject and the Patron of their Song. Illustrious Guests, Joint-Partners in our Love, Protect those Arts which by Your Influence live: Those Arts which We with Loyal Zeal improve, To you return the Vigour they receive. Whilst Ormond by undaunted Courage led, Regions unknown, and distant Foes alarms; We, Ormond's Care, to early Duty bred, Learn here to aid Your Councils, and Your Arms. To the QUEEN at Supper. Spoke by Mr. Finch, Son to the Honourable Heneage Finch Esq; With Love, tho rude, we croud this hallow'd Place, And clog that Triumph which we mean to grace, To view that QUEEN that frees Us from Alarms, Secures our Quiet, and directs our Arms. England before its ruin'd Trade deplor'd, A mourning Victor, and disputed Lord. Now moulding Fleets in Gallick Harbours ly, Whilst British Ships their double World defy. Our Muses hear the Battles from afar, And sing the Triumphs and enjoy the War. This now, but soon the quivering Spear they'l weild, And lead the shouting Squadrons to the Field. They'l serve that Princess whom before they sung, Defend that Queen beneath whose Eye they sprung. So spreading Oaks from lovely Windsor born, Shall shelter Britain which they now adorn: With swelling Sails o'er distant Seas they'l go, And guard that Goddess by whose Care they grow. To the QUEEN going to Bed. Spoke by Mr. Pultney. Madam, once more, th'obsequious Muse, With Zeal and just Ambition fir'd, Her grateful Homage here renews, In Numbers by your self inspir'd: And late her willing Duty shews, To guard You to Your safe Repose. Within this silent humble Cell, Secure the Gifts of Sleep receive; No Factions here, or Discords dwell, To break that Rest the Muses give. Here daily Cares help to encrease, Not interrupt, our mighty Ease. These Walls more happy now, possest Of the most fair and shining Court, Not in the Muses, but their Guest, Theirs, and the Muses, chief Support. So Delphos was the bless'd Abode Of Phebus Priests, and of the God. May Heaven its sacred Charge defend: May every Grace, and every Muse, Round You with watchful Care attend, And Balms of gentle Sleep infuse, Such as the Virtuous only know; Kind, as the Blessings You bestow. On the Duke of Ormond's Success at Vigo, 1702. Thro Storms of Wind, and swelling Seas which roar, Our mighty Ormond has possest our Shore. Fame ran before him like the Morning-Star, And told his Deeds and wondrous Feats in War; How he with English Force at once subdu'd The Gallick Ships, and Spanish Multitude: Those on the Sea in Flames with Light outvy'd The rising Sun, and scorch'd the flowing Tide. Th'afrighted Fishes to the Ocean swim, And say, Great Ormond, we're afraid of him. See on the shore the yielding Spaniards fly, And see on board their Ships the Frenchmen die. In vain they Bombs and Fortresses prepare 'Gainst English Valor, and the Fate of War. What weak dependance has the Watry Fry? On what Sea-God or Power can we rely? See Neptune yonder, the vast Ocean's God, At sight of Ormond hides his Head in Mud. The Tritons, flouncing thro the Oase, repair To Rocky Caverns from the Fate of War, And all Sea-Monsters bellow from afar. From Vigo's Port to th'Ocean all make way, For here, alas! they dare no longer stay; By burning Ships the Water's made so hot, Its Surface bubbles like a boiling Pot. Half-roasted Frenchmen, some o'er Gratings broil'd, Do mix with Spaniards in the Sea parboil'd. For Anjou's Dinner here's a pretty Dish; I vow h'has made a Kettle fine of Fish. Welcome Great Ormond to the English Land, With Laurels loaden from a Foreign Strand: Welcome to England, as to Sailers Day, When Storms and Darkness had obscur'd their Way. Welcome to us, as Mighty William was, When he restor'd us to our Rights and Laws. With like Respect as th'Senate thought your due, An honest English Heart returns his Thanks to you. On the Thanksgiving Day, Nov. 12. 1702. for the Success of her Majesty and her Allies by Sea and Land. Whilst Lewis the Tyrant Te Deum does sing, And the People rejoice at the Lies of their King, For the Wealth and the Strength of th'Invincible Flota, And the Confederates Loss at the Fort of La Rota; While they Temples profane with a Sanctify'd Cheat, And backwards praise God who has let 'em be beat; We join in our Praises for Victories known, For ev'ry one knows what our Forces have done. Our Queen to her People her Actions ne'er sham'd; And who will not rejoice, let 'em cry and be damn'd. The Jacks and High-Fliers this Day keep a Fast, Which as long as they live, I pray God it may last. But now ye true Britons, who honour your Queen, Consider of late how successful she's been; How Lewis lies groveling beneath her just Arms, Whilst our Land is secur'd both from Fears and Alarms. Let your Bonefires this Night enlighten the Sky, And even Great Ormond's at Vigo outvy: Let Rockets in th'Air each resemble a Torch, And Squibs, like High-Flyers, mount over the Church: Whilst Jacks, like the Bats, into Darkness do fly, And in Holes, just as Thrushes, in Winter do die; Let each Briton this Evening his Bumper drink off, To Anna the Great, but let him know when h' has enough. On the Recovery of his Royal Highness the Prince, Lord High Admiral of England. Novem. 1702. Annals and Statues have the Heroes grac'd, Design'd to make their Names and Actions last: And since 'tis so, 'tis England's Justice too, To rear their Monuments of Praise to You. Departing Heroes, like retiring Light, That veils the Day, and introduces Night, Create Regret, as you Great Prince have done, You whom we all esteem'd a Setting Sun. Shades have attempted e'en our Royal Queen; Shades have attempted, tho they could not skreen, For thro those Shades still Majesty was seen. While Denmark's Darling, and our Britain's Love, With Fate that brought Superior Orders, strove; Orders that wou'd have rob'd our mourning Isle, And laid our Hopes upon the Funeral Pile. But now, instead of Ashes Roses come; Our Hopes are now reviv'd as in the Bloom, Our Prince is rescu'd from the craving Tomb. Let grateful Anthems eccho to the Skys, In Strains that imitate their Harmonys. The Zeal, the Gratitude, the Praise we own, To that Above, for Blessings on our Throne. Hail Happy Pair! May Foreign Shores resound, And waft the Wish the Universe around; Whilst all but France and Spain the Words rebound. Great Anna, as You both adorn the Crown, May both your Loves increase by being own: Like You, may we your Subjects all unite; In Harmony, as well as You, delight, And England against England never fight. On the French Protestants extolling their Prince, notwithstanding his forcing them to abandon their Native Country. Happy the People where no Priest gives Rules, Whose slavish Doctrines fetter Free-born Souls: Where unconstrain'd Obedience is paid Only to Laws that we our selves have made: Such England is, and such She shall remain, Beneath the Blessings of Great William's Reign. Where Prince and People Gratefully do strive; He guards our Rights, We his Prerogative. Then curs'd be those who would our Rights betray To the vain Lusts of Arbitrary Sway; Who proud of Misery, and fond of Chains, Extol the Beauty of Despotick Reigns. But let that Priest be curs'd for ever more, Who has so soon forgot the Chains he wore: Condemn'd again to Gallick Wooden Shoos, Who durst his New-born Freedom thus abuse. Let him go home and preach that Doctrine, where The Subjects Birth-Right is Eternal Fear, Those little French Devices won't take here. Must such a paltry Vagabond as he Presume to censure English Liberty? Why prithee Fool, what are our Rights to thee, Thou who wert born and bred in Slavery? In vain 'tis then, that we our Gifts bestow On those that wou'd our Happiness o'erthrow; Who nurs'd with Charity and blest with Peace, Grow Wanton under unaccustom'd Ease: Shall impudently dare to recommend Those Slaveries from which we them defend. In vain Abroad for Freedom do we fight, If these warm'd Snakes at home abuse our Native Right. On her Majesty's Birth-day, Feb. 6. 1702. I. Rise, lofty Numbers! Rise from Scenes of Light, And let the Dullest Briton see All Shades that be, Yield to dispelling Harmony, And try the charming Eloquence of Verse. Ye Mutes, who round the Sable Herse Of mighty William late did sit, All your Dumb signs of Grief forget: Ye living Emblems of Eternal Night, Each Artificial Spright, Who would the Muses and their Sons affright; Rise! Rise! I say, your Throats prepare, Lament no more the God of War, Nor heed his Trumpets from afar: Your Throats prepare, and in melodious Noise To Anna's Fame extend your high exalted Voice. II. William the Brave, the Just, the Good is gone, Anna the Vertuous does possess his Throne: Æneas (tho no juster Prince Did the Almighty Gods revere, Or greater General try'd the dubious Fate of War) Yields to our Mighty William now remov'd from hence. Eliza (who our Chronicles relate, Guarded so well the Seas, and Britain's State,) Her Fame to Anna's must give Place, Anna does Fly, not Run, in Glory's Race; Eliza at long Run with Hands embrew'd In Blood, the Spanish daring Force subdu'd: Anna no sooner mounted on the Throne, But with one stroke she kick'd the Spaniards down. III. Ah happy Britons with two Reigns thus blest, Long shall your Flocks and Lowing Herds have rest; Your mighty Pan, alas! has left the Plain, But great Astrea in his stead does reign: She too your Flocks from ravenous Wolves will keep, She'll guard the Jolly Sheperd and his Sheep: Beneath your Vines you may in safety sit, And all the Ills of Tory Reigns forget; When by the Ax and Rope your Patriots fell, A Bloody Sacrifice to Rome and Hell. May no curst Tory to her Councils creep, Nor have Command by Land or on the Deep: May they Dominion never more regain, To shorten soon the Scenes of Her Blest Reign. Britons rejoice, and thank the Heavenly Powers, They are her Enemies as well as yours. The Golden Age Restor'd. A Poem in imitation of the fourth Pastoral of Virgil; suppos'd to have been taken from a Sibylline Prophecy. — Paulo Majora canamus. Siclian Muse, begin a loftier Flight, Not all in Trees and lowly Shrubs delight: Or if your Rural Shades you still pursue, Make your Shades fit for able Statesmens view. The time is come, by antient Bards foretold, Restoring the Saturnian Age of Gold: The Vile, Degenerate, Whiggish Offspring ends, A High-Church Progeny from Heaven descends. O Learned Oxford, spare no Sacred Pains To nurse the Glorious Breed, now thy own B?ley reigns. And thou Great S?l, Darling of this Land, Do'st foremost in that fam'd Commission stand; Whose deep Remarks the listening World admires, By whose auspicious Care old Ra?gh expires. Your mighty Genius no strict Rules can bind; You punish Men for Crimes, which you want time to find. Senates shall now like Holy Synods be, And Holy Synods Senate-like agree. M?th and M?n here instruct the Youth, There B??ks and Kim?ly maintain the Sacred Truth. P?is and H??lin here with equal Claim, Thro wide West-Saxon Realms extend their Fame; There B??ch and H??per Right Divine convey, Nor treat their Bishops in a humane way. Now all our Factions, all our Fears shall cease, And Tories rule the promis'd Land in Peace. Malice shall die, and noxious Poisons fail, H?y shall cease to trick, and S?ur cease to rail: The Lambs shall with the Lions walk unhurt, And H?x with H? meet civilly at Court. Viceroys, like Providence, with distant Care, Shall govern Kingdoms where they ne'er appear: Pacifick Admirals, to save the Fleet, Shall fly from Conquest, and shall Conquest meet: Commanders shall be prais'd at William's Cost, And Honour be retriev'd before 'tis lost. Br?ton and Bur??by the Court shall grace, And H? shall not disdain to share a Place. Forgotten Molineux and Mason now Revive and shine again in F??? and H???. But as they stronger grow and mend their Strain, By choice Examples of King Charles's Reign; Bold Bel???sis and Patriot Da??nant then, One shall employ the Sword, and one the Pen: Troops shall be led to plunder, not to fight, The Tool of Faction shall to Peace invite, And Foes to Union be imploy'd the Kingdoms to unite. Yet still some Whigs among the Peers are found, Like Brambles flourishing in barren Ground. Som??rs maliciously imploys his Care To make the Lords the Legislature share. Bu?t declares how French Dragooning rose, And Bishops Persecuting Bills oppose: Till Ro?r's cool Temper shall be fir'd, And N??th's and Not?m's strong Reas'nings be admir'd. But when due Time their Counsels shall mature, And fresh Removes have made the Game secure; When Som?et and Dev?ire give Place To Windham's B?d, and to R?d's Grace, Both Converts great; when Justice is refin'd, And Corporations garbled to their Mind, Then Passive Doctrines shall with Glory rise, Before them hated Moderation flies, And Antichristian Toleration dies. Gr?ile shall seize the long expected Chair, Go?in to some Country-Seat repair; P?ke from all Employments be debar'd, And Mar?gh for antient Crimes receive his just Reward. France, that this happy Change so wisely has begun, Shall bless the great Design, and bid it smoothly run. Come on, young J?'s Friends, this is the Time, come on; Receive just Honours, and surround the Throne. Boldly your Loyal Principles maintain, H?s now rules the State, and R? the Main. Gr?es is at hand the Members to reward, And Troops are trusted to your own Gr?rd. The faithful Clubs assemble at the Vine, And French Intrigues are broach'd o'er English Wine. Freely the S?te the Design proclaims, Affronting W?m, and applauding J?es. Good antient Members with a solemn Face, Propose that Safety give to Order place; And what they dare not openly dissuade, Is by Expedients ineffectual made. E'en F???ch and Mu?ve, whom the Court caress, Exalt its Praises, but its Power depress; And that Impartial Justice may be seen, Confirm to Friends what they refus'd the Queen. Bishops who most advanc'd Good J?'s Cause In Church and State, now reap deserv'd Applause: While those who rather made the Tow'r their Choice, Are stil'd Unchristian by the Nation's Voice. Avow'dly now St. David's Cause they own, And J?es's Votes for Simony atone. Archbishop K?n shall from Longleat be drawn, While firm Nonjurors from behind stand crowding for the Lawn. And thou, Great W?th, to reward thy Charge, Shalt fail to Lambeth in his Grace's Barge. See by base Rebels J?es the Just betray'd, See his Three Realms by vile U?rs sway'd; Then see with Joy his lawful H? restor'd, And erring Nations own their injur'd L?. O would kind Heaven so long my Life maintain, Inspiring Raptures worthy such a Reign! Not Thracian St. J?ns should with me contend, Nor my sweet Lays harmonious Ha?nd mend: Not tho young Davenant St. J?ns should protect, Or the shrewd Doctor Ha?nd's Lines correct. Nay should Tr?am in St Maws compare his Songs to mine; Tr?am, tho St. Maws were Judg, his Laurel should resign. Prepare, Auspicious Youth, thy Friends to meet; Sir G? already has prepar'd the Fleet. Should Rival Neptune (who with envious Mind In times of Danger still this Chief confin'd) Now send the Gout, the Hero to disgrace, Honest G? Ch? may supply his Place. The Fourth Pastoral of Virgil, Englished by Mr. Dryden. Sicilian Muse, begin a loftier Strain, Tho lowly Shrubs and Trees that shade the Plain Delight not all; Sicilian Muse, prepare To make the vocal Woods deserve a Consul's Care. The last great Age, foretold by Sacred Rhimes, Renews its finish'd Course, Saturnian Times Roll round again, and mighty Years begun From their first Orb, in radiant Circles run. The base degenerate Iron Offspring ends; A golden Progeny from Heaven descends. O chast Lucina, speed the Mother's Pains, And haste the Glorious Birth, thy own Apollo reigns. The lovely Boy, with his auspicious face, Shall Pollio's Consulship and Triumph grace, Majestick Months set out with him to their appointed Race. The Father banish'd Virtue shall restore, And Crimes shall threat the guilty World no more: The Son shall lead the Life of Gods, and be By Gods and Heroes seen, and Gods and Heroes see: The jarring Nations he in Peace shall bind, And with paternal Virtues rule Mankind. Unbidden Earth shall wreathing Ivy bring, And fragrant Herbs (the Promises of Spring) As her first Off'rings to her Infant King. The Goats with strutting Dugs shall homeward speed, And lowing Herds secure from Lions feed. His Cradle shall with rising Flowers be crown'd, The Serpents Brood shall die, the sacred Ground Shall Weeds and poisonous Plants refuse to bear, Each common Bush shall Syrian Roses wear. But when Heroick Verse his Youth shall raise, And form it to Hereditary Praise; Unlabour'd Harvests shall the Fields adorn, And cluster'd Grapes shall blush on every Thorn: The knotted Oaks shall Show'rs of Honey weep, And thro the matted Grass the liquid Gold shall creep. Yet of old Fraud some Footsteps shall remain, The Merchant still shall plough the Deep for Gain; Great Cities shall with Walls be compass'd round, And sharpned Shares shall vex the fruitful Ground: Another Eyphis shall new Seas explore, Another Argos land the Chiefs upon th'Iberian Shore; Another Helen other Wars create, And Great Achilles urge the Trojan Fate. But when to ripen'd Manhood he shall grow, The greedy Sailor shall the Seas forego: No Keel shall cut the Waves for foreign Ware, For every Soil shall every Product bear: The labouring Hind his Oxen shall disjoin, No Plow shall hurt the Glebe, no Pruning-hook the Vine, Nor Wool shall in dissembled Colours shine. But the luxurious Father of the Fold, With native Purple or unbarred Gold, Beneath his pompous Fleece shall proudly sweat, And under Tyrian Robes the Lamb shall bleat. The Fates, when they this happy Web have spun, Shall bless the sacred Clue, and bid it smoothly run: Mature in Years, to ready Honours move, O of Celestial Seed, O Foster Son of Jove! See! labouring Nature calls thee to sustain The nodding Frame of Heaven, and Earth and Main: See to their base restor'd Earth, Seas and Air, And joyful Ages from behind in crowding Ranks appear. To sing thy Praise, would Heaven my Breath prolong, Infusing Spirits worthy such a Song, Not Thracian Orpheus should transcend my Lays, Nor Linus crown'd with never-fading Bays; Tho each his Heavenly Parent should inspire, The Muse instruct the Voice, and Phœbus tune the Lyre. Should Pan contend in Verse, and thou my Theme, Arcadian Judges should their God condemn. Begin, Auspicious Boy, to cast about Thy Infant Eyes, and with a Smile thy Mother single out: Thy Mother well deserves that short Delight, The nauseous Qualms of ten long Months and Travel to requite. Then smile, the frowning Infants Doom is read, No God shall crown the Board, nor Goddess bless the Bed. Advice to a Painter, 1697. What Hand, what Skill can frame the Artful Piece, To paint our Ruins in a proper Dress? Inspire us, Denham's Genius, whilst we write, Urg'd by true Zeal to do our Country right; As when the daring Artist, taught by you, With Master-strokes the first bold Landskip drew. Here, Painter, here employ thy utmost Skill; With War and Slav'ry the large Canvas fill: And that the Lines be easier understood, Paint not with fading Colours, paint with Blood; Blood of our bravest Youth in Battel slain, At Steenkirk spilt, or Landen's fatal Plain; Or that which flow'd, and does just Heaven invoke, When F?k yield to the fatal Stroke. First draw the (R) Hero seated on the Throne, Spite of all Law, himself observing none; Let English Rights all gasping round him lie, And native Freedom thrown neglected by: On either hand the Priest and Lawyer set, Two fit Supporters of the Monarch's Seat. There in a greazy Rotchet cloth'd describe The bulky Oracle of the Preaching Tribe; That solid necessary Tool of State, Profoundly Dull, Divinely Obstinate. Here with polluted Robes just reeking draw The Adulterous Moderator of the Law; Whose wrinkled Cheeks and fallow Looks proclaim, The ill effect of his distemper'd Flame. Next cringing B?n?g place, whose Earth-born Race The Coronet and Garter does disgrace; Of undescended Parentage, made great By Chance, his Vertues not discover'd yet. Patron of the Noblest Order; O be just To thy Heroick Founder's injur'd Dust! From his Ignoble Neck thy Collar tear, Let not his Breast thy Rays of Honour wear; To black Designs and Lust let him remain A servile Favorite, and Grants obtain: While antient Honours sacred to the Crown Are lavish'd to support the Minion. Pale Envy rages in his canker'd Breast, And to the British Man a Foe profest. Artist retire, 'twere Insolence too great T'expose the Secrets of the Cabinet; Or tell how they their looser Minutes spend, That guilty Scene would all chast Eyes offend. For should you pry into the close Alcove, And draw the Exercise of Royal Love, K?pp?l and He are Ganymede and Jove. Avert the Omen, Heavens! O may I ne'er Purchase a Title at a Rate so dear: In some mean Cottage let me die unknown, Rather than thus be Darling of a Throne. Now Painter, now thy Art is at a stand, For who can draw that Proteus S?d?d? The deep Reserves of whose Apostate Mind, No Skill can reach, no Principles can bind; Whose working Brain does more Disguises bear Than ever yet in Vision did appear. A supple whispering Minister, ne'er just, Confided still, still failing in his Trust, And only constant to unnat'ral Lust. For Witchery and prostituted Faith made great, Yet this is he that must support the Weight, And prop the Ruins of a falling State. Artist proceed, next the brib'd Senate draw, That Arbitrary Body above Law; Place Noise and Faction and Disorder there, And formal Paul set mumping in the Chair; Once the chief Bulwark of the Church and State, Their Darling once, but now their Fear and Hate: So a rich Cordial, when its Virtues spent, Contributes to the Death it should prevent. Of publick Treasure lavishly profuse, Large Sums diverted to their private use; By Places and by Bounties largely paid, For Rights given up, and Liberties betray'd. Expose the Mercenary Herd to view, And in the Front Imperious M?gue: With venal Wit, and prostituted Sense, With matchless Pride and matchless Impudence; To whose successful Villany we owe All his own Ills, and all that others do. Slavish Excises are his darling Sin, And Chequer-Bills the Project of his Brain; No publick Prospect, but conducing most To raise his Fortune at the publick Cost. Order and Precedents are Terms of Course, Too weak to interrupt his rapid Force; Till Wiser Commons shall in time to come Their Antient English Principles resume, And give their base Corrupter his just Doom. Thus have I seen a Whelp of Lion's Brood Couch, fawn and lick his Keeper's Hand for Food, Till in some fatal Hour the generous Beast, By an insulting Lash, or some gross Fraud opprest, His just Resentment terribly declares, Disdains the Marks of Slavery he wears, And his weak Feeder into pieces tears. Here Painter draw our Politician B?le, That fawning Arse-worm with his cringing smile; Relations, Country, Court do all despise him, He's grown so low ev'n B?g??ry can't rise him. Let Gaffney's noble Hangman next advance, And tell his Fears of Popery and France; And for the blust'ring Pedant leave a space, Who wears Corinthian Metal in his face: See where the florid warlike C?tts appears, As brave and senseless as the Sword he wears. Here Sloan baits S?ur, L?ton Jack H?, And all the while old Bowman cries Bow Wow. To P??ms and St?land, and the Yorkshire Crew By Sm?th directed, the next Station's due. Sm?th whilst he seems good-natur'd, frank and kind, Betrays th'inveterate Temper of his Mind. To the Chit Sp?r Painter next be just, That weak sour Offspring of a forced Lust, Which his unnatural Father grudg'd to spare From his Italian Joy, and spoil'd his Heir; From hence that aukward Politician came, To Commonwealth, which he admires, a Shame, A Slave to Kings tho he abhors the Name. He votes for Armies, talks for Liberty, In th'House for Millions, out for Property: Thus Father-like, with Flattery betrays That Government which he propos'd to raise. Near him Lord William bawls, whose well-stock'd Brain Out-weighs Chit's Index-Learning half a Grain. With these as fellow Empricks in design, Let W??ton, Rich, Y??ng, Cl??k, and Hubbard join; And let not H???les pass unregarded by. 'Twere endless to recount the meaner Fry Of yelping Yeas and No's, who baul by rote, To multiply the Unites of a Vote; Opprest with Clamour, Truth and Justice flies, And thus pursu'd, down hunted Reason lies. Some few untainted Patriots yet remain, Who native Zeal and Probity retain; These sullen draw, disgrac'd and discontent, Mourning the Ruin which they can't prevent. But Painter hold—Reserve the vacant Room For Knaves in Embrio, and Rogues to come; Who undiscover'd yet with Ease betray, And sell their Country in a closer way. An Answer to the Earl of Rochester's Satyr against Man. Written by Dr. P?????ck. Were I to choose what sort of Corps I'd wear, I'd not be Dog, Lord Monkey, nor Earl Bear; But I'd be Man, not as I am, the worst; But Man refin'd, such as he was at first. The speechless State of Brutes I would refuse, For the same Cause another does it chuse, For then the Reputation I should lose Of Wit, Extravagance, and Mode, from whence Reason is made to truckle under Sense. Or if to Sense I did so much incline, I'd rather be a Satyr, Goat or Swine; To help to break the Court-Physicians, who Besides compounding Lusts have nought to do. Nature (exceeding Broths) would then excite Supplys to make a full-meal'd Appetite, Nor bugbear Conscience dulling the Delight. But what need such a Metamorphosis? Man being Man, can e'en do more than this; Granting the Principle, that Reason's use Is not to curb, but make Sense more profuse. For tho Man's Life more vigorous is than Brutes, His Pander Reason can contrive Recruits For its Defects; what Sins the sensual Man Can't do alone, the Reasonable can. With useful Wit for Sensuality, An half unfashion'd Sinner does descry; He's modishly debauch'd who can't tell why: That stirs up slow-pac'd Lust by Argument, Who to hir'd Sense gives no Divertisement, But calls for more when all its Force is spent. And tho the bragging Wretch would be content, Disabled from more Vice, now to repent, Upbraided Reason scorns the puny Motion, Bids it cheer up, and gives it t'other Potion; Till after all when Nature has giv'n o'er, And Art can buoy up aged Sense no more, Reason reserves this Remedy at last, To think those Pleasures which it cannot tast. In this a thinking Fool may become wise, And yet think on so, that his Thinking lies In Notions of Venereal Mysteries. Hence sprung the reasoning Arts in former Days, Of Spinstrix, Oscis, and the Modern ways, By Baths, Lascivious Pictures, Jigs and Plays. If this be Reason's use, no more we'll call Clodius Incontinent, but Rational, And boast the Reason of Sardanapal. Reason nicknam'd, like Quakers newfound Light, One while call'd Spirit, alias Appetite: A Stupid Reason, which none will defend, But he who has with Brutes one common end; Debasing Reason, coupling every Ass, E'en with my Lord in the same reasoning Class. I'll be no Student in this reasoning School; I'd rather be that Humane thinking Fool, A Cloyster'd Coxcomb able to converse, Altho alone, with the whole Universe; And reasoning, into Heaven mount from thence, Post Gazets of Divine Intelligence, And sacred Knowledge most remote from Sense. Might I be plac'd in this exploded Sphere, I'd not alone forgive that Witty Jeer, But boast the name of reasoning Engineer. But as for Man made perfect and upright, Why not the Image of the Infinite? Were this a Scandal to his Glory, must We for his Honour sake his Word distrust? Or is an Image such a very same With what it represents, that it must claim Its full Perfections? sure, my Picture might Be painted like me, and yet void of Sight. Must the first Draught of Man be vilify'd, Scorn'd and contemn'd, 'cause Man himself has stray'd? Or did not Eve sufficiently transgress, And bastardize Posterity, unless Man, little as he is, be made much less? Tho he does not his higher End pursue So well as does that more Ignoble Crew Of Birds and Beasts, that little have to do; The difficulty of his lofty End Above the others, does his Cause defend, And in the Means a disproportion pleads; Choice sways the one Instinct, the other leads. 'Tis not 'cause Jowler cries, he kills the Hare, But 'tis because Jowler cannot forbear. Tho in the Chair of State some lolling sit, That therefore none can sit upright in it, Is a false Consequence, and void of Wit. But you your self have taught Man such a way Unto his happiness, that he must stray: For if his Sense must usher in his Rest, And never be abridg'd of its request, He may be drunk and pockey, but ne'er blest. As for Pride gendring Philosophy, A Captious word, 'tis what you'l have it be: Your nice Distinctions have an Art to show 'Tis good or bad, or neither, as please you. Some Sects love Wrangling, others Pedantry; But in the Love of Wisdom all agree; Wisdom, which all acknowledg to be good, But has the Fate to be misunderstood. But tho Fools croud among Philosophers, The fault is not the Sciences but theirs; With all their Flaws our Bedlam School I'd choose Before the madder Taverns leuder Shews. Tho both are Slaves, I rather do respect The Stoick than the Epicurean Sect. If Sense or Reason once must be deny'd, Reason would tell me, Reason must abide, The less obnoxious and the surest Guide. But since kind Nature has design'd them both For Humane Complement, I should be loth To give up Humane Sense to its own Will, Or grant a Tyrant Reason leave to kill Such useless Faculties; my Reason shall Govern my Subject Sense, but not enthral. Nor shall officious Sense presume to act, Till Justice Reason authorize the Fact. That Humane Nature is corrupt I grant; But was't the use of Reason or the want That put out the warm Breath of Love? From whence Sprung Murder first, but from malicious Sense? Which having once usurp'd Queen Reason's Throne, 'Twas not contented with one Sin alone, But falling headlong, plainly shows, alas, By too too fatal Proofs, that that which was The best, corrupted, to the worst doth pass. Hence the acutest Wits, when they're defil'd, Turn most Extravagant, Profane and Wild, Defend Debaucheries, and Sense advance To Reason, Reason out of Countenance, Making their Knowledg worse than Ignorance. But must Humanity be quite eras'd, Because it is from what it was defac'd? Or must the little Reason Men yet hold For their Improvement, be for Dogs Flesh sold? Sometimes the Gamester, when ill Fortune crosses, With his last Stake recovers all his Losses. He's but a weak Physician who gives o'er His weaker Patient, whom he might restore. But may he suffer an Eternal Curse, That dares prescribe a Remedy that's worse Than the Disease it self: when Jowler's lame, No one expects that he should kill the Game; But that he may hereafter, I am sure 'Tis best not to cut off his Legs but cure. He that feels Qualms of Conscience in his Breast, Let him not barter Reason with a Beast, But purge the Guilt with which he is opprest. That Honesty's against all Common Sense, Is a good Argument for my defence. If Sense with that which has so good a Name Is inconsistent, Sense is much to blame; And Reason will, spite of your Rhyme and Tide Of Ink, Wit and Contempt, more firm abide, For having such a Vertue on its side. And Valour to take part with her for Sense, As you contrive it, puts no difference Between the Valiant that are so for fear, And Cowards who would be so, but don't dare. Reason could never frame so witty a thing, That Man should fight for fear of Quarrelling. All men, you say, for Fools or Knaves must go, And he's a Man himself who calls them so: And being Man, is at his own Choice free, Or in the Rank of Fools or Knaves to be; Let him be either, or else both for me. But let me, Sir, request, before you slip Into your Dog, or Bear, or Monkey's Shape, Whether you think their Brutish Form procures Any Advantages exceeding yours. Both Dog and Bear, as well as Man will fight, And (to no purpose too) each other bite. And as for Puggy, all his Virtues lie In aping Man, the only thing you fly. The wisest way the Evil to redress, Is to be what you are not more or less, That is not Man, Dog, Bear, nor Monkey neither, But a Rare something of 'em altogether. The Golden Age Revers'd. Sicilian Goddess, whose Prophetick tongue Reveals Fate's dark Decrees in Sacred Song; The present vile degenerate Age disdain, And sound the Glories of a Future Reign: When Whigs again shall rouse the drooping Land, Unnerv'd and weaken'd by a Female Hand. St?d for his great Wealth and Wisdom known, Has in the Faction's Name ador'd the Rising Sun, Secur'd the point, and made the Game their own. Then So?t, in whose capacious Mind Learning and solid Sense with Wit are join'd, Judiciously in Council shall preside; And ev'ry deep Design, and ev'ry Project guide. Then H?x, by Nature form'd to please, Humble in Greatness, easy of Access, With unaffected Air the Court shall grace, And safe from Angry Votes enjoy his Place. Tonson and he in frequent close Debate Shall pondring weigh the business of the State; Then D?re, whose elevated Chin Proclaims the happy Vacancy within, Shall shuffle with his Creditors no more, But pay his Debts, forsake his Dice and Whore. Wh?n, for Valour and for Truth renown'd, Whose ev'ry Action is with Justice crown'd, Whose innocent and undesigning Life Was always free from Faction, free from Strife, Shall be invested with his old Command, And wrest the Staff from haughty Seymour's hand. S?rs, tho weak in Body, strong in Mind, No Pox can taint a Substance so refin'd! With just Applauses shall resume the Mace; For now, neglecting Health, and private Ease, He heals Divisions, and promotes the Publick Peace. Or?d shall lord it o'er the Subject Main, Eager of Battel, negligent of Gain. M?n shall put on a Politician's Face, For Sense with Riches always does increase; By Railing now, he'll then deserve a Place. What if sometimes when Strumpet lewd appears, The Rake confessing, he the Sage cashiers? So Puss transform'd, the Mouse could not refrain, But re-assum'd her Shape, and mew'd again, For Nature will in spite of Art remain. Ha?ngs, tho now he struts with Comick Mien, And sneers and jokes with Countenance serene, Shall gravely quit his Jests, and lisping praise The glorious Prospect of these happy Days. Young S?nd, of honest Parents born, Mature in Council, shall the Board adorn Shall emulate his Father's spotless Fame, And with a Faith like his secure a lasting Name. B?t, the Glory of the Lawn he wears, Firm to the Churches Interest appears, Asserts and vindicates her injur'd Cause, Whene'er invaded by Conforming Foes: This holy Man shall T?n succeed, Tall T?n, the Churches awful Head, Whose venerable Fabrick fills the Eye With solemn Apostolick Majesty. Lambeth rejoice, when one great Prelate dies, Another, great as he, shall soon arise, Of equal Gravity, of equal Size. Then Ha?ton, the Commous mighty Chief, Who with undaunted Zeal oppos'd the word Retrieve, Shall baffle Harcourt's Reasoning, Harley's Reach, Musgrave's Experience, Seymour's lofty Speech. Jekyl, who was by his own Merits rais'd, Shall justly be by all admir'd and prais'd. Jessop and he with Finch's Tongue shall vie, And ev'ry Period, ev'ry Trope supply: Bromley's clear Notions, Granvile's Vehemence Shall yield to Jervois Wit, and Pawlet's Sense. Then B?le, like Sampson, for his Hair renown'd, One was with Strength and one with Beauty crown'd, Shall make no scruple to wheel round again, For he, sweet Soul! complies with ev'ry Reign. Now Li?ton disdains to buy a Place, But then the long forbidden Chair shall grace; All his Debates shall be from Trifles free, Nor Tale be heard, nor idle Repartee. K?g in a mixt Capacity shall shine, The Lawyer's here, and there the Tub Divine. C?per shall leave his Whoring, and grow chast; For such excessive Lewdness ne'er can last. Str?nd shall wisely talk, and cease to rant; And F?g forget his formal tedious Cant. Str?ger no longer shall a Bully seem; The Tories Terror, and the Whigs Esteem. St?pe, that Offspring of unlawful Lust, Begot with more than Matrimonial Gust, Who thinks no Pleasure like Italian Joy, And to a Venus Arms prefers a Pathick Boy, Shall thunder in a Senate and the Field, And reap what Fame, or Arms, or Arts can yield. Go?n, who this mighty Change foresees, Advances to their Cause by just degrees; And happy they who can secure his Heart, Unvarnish'd with the false disguise of Art: His Thoughts are free, sincere and unconfin'd, His Words the dictates of an open Mind. But S?h sure, who now surrounds the Throne With her Innumerable Pygmee-spawn, Can never hope a more Auspicious Reign, A kinder Mistress or a greater Queen. L?ds, Wey?th, Ab?don and No?by, R?ke, No?m and Ro?er shall fly To some Recess, and there obscurely die. For their unequal Sense can ne'er support The vast Ambitious Aims of such a Court. Ma?ter, B?ton, Ha?am, C?sle, The Pride and Glory of our British Isle, Shall undertake and execute the noble Toil. O that my languid Numbers I could raise, High as their Merits, sounding as their Praise! Not Man?ring, tho all his Club should join, And So?set himself correct each Line, Could e'er produce Diviner Lays than mine. Nay, towring Ha?x, that Giant Wit, Tho he transcrib'd and own'd what Prior writ, Could not pretend to reach the matchless Strain, The Poet's Envy, and the Criticks Pain. The Golden Age, from the Fourth Eclog of Virgil, &amp;c. Sicilian Muse, thy Voice and Subject raise, All are not pleas'd with Shrubs and Sylvan Lays; Or if we Shrubs and Sylvan Lays prepare, Let 'em be such as sute a Consul's Year. Now Merlin's Prophecys are made compleat, And Lilly's best Events with Credit meet; Now Banish'd Justice takes its rightful Place, And Saturn's Days return with St?rts's Race. With its own Lustre now the Church appears, As one Year makes amends for fourteen Years, And Joys succeed our Sighs, and Hopes succeed our Fears. O Goddess, Genius of this Favorite Isle, On thy own Work, this Revolution, smile; Salute the Pleasures that come rolling on, And greet the Wonders Heav'n and thou hast done; Worthy the Glorious Change inspire our Strains, Now thy own Anna rules, in Her own Kingdom Reigns. And thou, O Dashwood, by peculiar Care, Reserv'd till now to fill Augusta's Chair, Behold the Mighty Months Progressive shine! See 'em begin their Golden Race in Thine! Under thy Consulship, Lo! Vice gives way, And Whigs for ever cease to come again in Play. The Life of Gods the Monarch shall partake, Belov'd by Gods and Men for Virtues sake; As she from Heroes sprung, brave Acts prefers, And Heroes copy out their Fame from Hers; As Kingdoms Rights she with her own maintains, And where her injur'd F?r govern'd, reigns. Hail Sacred Queen! Thy very Enemies own Thy Lawful Claim, and recognize thy Throne; Dissembling Statesmen shall before thee stand, And H? be first will kiss thy Hand; S? shall change his Temper with his Fate, And promise Duty where he vow'd his Hate, Seeming for past Offences to atone, By complementing Claims he would postpone; Had one but liv'd, that rais'd him, to his Shame, To let him pack the Cards, and win the Game. W? shall to St. James's House resort, And leave his Master's Corps to make his Court; S? shall quit the Practice of his Place, Leave cutting Timber down in E?d Ch??se, To seek for Favour, and prevail for Grace. Old R? shall thy Accession sing, Hoping to serve Thee as he serv'd the King; To keep his Grid-iron while he keeps his Life, And build fresh Mansion-Houses for his Wife. Lyons with Lambs united shall agree, And Lambs like Lyons, Lyons Lambs shall be, And S? with S? hail and bow the Knee. K? shall drop his Convocation Spleen, And Att?y quarrels with the Dean, To join in our Allegiance with the Queen. The Churchmen and Dissenters shall combine To pay the Tribute due to Stuart's Line, As Presbyters with B?ps shall comply, And B?ps shall fling out what Presbyters deny; Like L?'s Watermen, whose Tempers shew, That look one way while they another row. Yet shall some Footsteps of old Fraud remain, And Ills be practis'd in thy Golden Reign, M?en at Sea shall in his Duty fail, And Wade and Dastard Kirkby turn their Tail. H? at Land his Country shall abuse, And B— by Plund'ring Conquest lose; While British Troops with Or?nd at their Head; Shall meet with Conquest who from Conquest fled; And Mal?gh, of William's Post possess'd, Reducing Liege, shall France it self invest. S?'s huge P?te shall before thee preach, And his dead Lord to flatter thee impeach; Old dreaming W?r, once the Church's Pride, Shall quit her Interest for another side, Brow-beat his Clergy, and a Chief defame, Spotless as is the Blood from whence he came; And tho a Prisoner made in dubious times, Shall now deserve the T?r for real Crimes. Midst Lords and Commons shall Disputes arise, And one disswade what t'other shall advise. Proud Adriatick O? shall be known To sink the Nation's Money for his own, And fix the Courtiers Thefts upon the Throne. Funds shall, as if no Funds there were, appear, Millions be giv'n the Kingdoms Debts to clear, Yet shall we owe the Millions that we gave, And pay for what we had not Wit to save; Unless some Moths that fret the thredbare State, Prevent our Ruin by their timely Fate, Unless a P? more often A?ts keeps, And gives the Queen the Crop which now he reaps. But when confirm'd in Arts of Empire grown, Thou seest thy Reign mature, and fix'd thy Throne, Both Land and Sea thy Sovereign Power shall own; Fearless of Loss, and confident of Gain, The Merchant shall in Safety plough the Main, The lab'ring Hind shall cleave the Country Soil, And Plenty rise, and court the Farmer's Toil. As every Subject sees his Wrongs redress'd, Views Faction quell'd, and Anarchy suppress'd, And Prince and People mutually bless'd. Such be thy Reign, the Fatal Sisters cry, And such Britannia's Future Destiny. Arise Auspicious Queen! the Times are come, When France shall from thy Mouth expect her Doom; When Providence shall labour in thy Cause, And trembling Spain acknowledg English Laws: Arise thou Bright Inspirer of my Song, And vindicate the Blood from whence thou'rt sprung. See the consenting World adore thy Fame! Heav'n, Earth, and Sea confess the Justice of thy Claim! See us for Thee our Vows and Prayers employ, And coming Ages smile in hopes of coming Joy. Oh! that this Life of mine so long would last, As I might sing thy future Deeds and past, As on thy rising Glories I might dwell, And I in Verse, as thou in Fame, excel! Not thy own Fate, tho with thy Laurels crown'd, Should touch a sweeter Pipe, or give a sweeter Sound: Not Favorite R?, tho I?y took his Part, Should boast more Judgment, or reveal more Art; Not C?ve stock'd with all his Patron's Praise, Produce a Zeal like mine, or equal Lays; Tho C? H? his Friend should be, C?ve, if H? were Judg, should yield to me. Begin, Great Queen, the St?t's Steps to tread, And let thy Living Worth exceed the Dead; Happiest of Princes in this Climate born, Entirely English, above thy Enemies Scorn. Thou ne'er wert dandled on an A?'s Knee, Not H?r stood Godfather for thee, But sprung directly from the British Strain, Where thou first drew'st thy Breath, dost there commence thy Reign. A Poem, in defence of the Church of England; In Opposition to the Hind and Panther, written by Mr. John Dryden. If we into our selves, or round us look, We find a God, exprest in Natures Book. The Sacred Truth is writ in every Breast; By every Clime and every Tongue confest: Th'inconstant World kneel'd early to the Sun; His fruitful Light Idolatry begun. Saturn, Mercurius, Jupiter, and Mars, Were but the Names of several wandring Stars. Men worship'd with Idolatry; like theirs Who slight our Kings, and court their Ministers. Hero's that did great Actions here on Earth, Were said at last to be of Heavenly Birth: And when no man wou'd own the doubtful Child, Then Jove or Mars the easy Nymph beguil'd. But different Climes invented several Rites; For Nature in variety delights: Some sacrific'd a Child, others a Ram; Unlike the Offrings, but the Zeal the same. Some cut their Flesh, and whipt themselves with Rods, As if their Blood and Torture pleas'd their Gods. Bacchus with Feasts and Revels some ador'd; Devoutly drank, and piously they whor'd. Unnatural Sins defil'd their sensual Nights, Till Heathen Virtue rose against such Rites, And drove that lewd Religion out of Rome, Damning by Law all Bacchanals to come. Apis the Ox in Egypt was ador'd, Their Gardens with Green Deities were stor'd; Succeeding Times their Princes Deify'd, And Priests and Temples for the Dead decreed; In Venus Fame Selden de Dis Syris Cap. 7. others their Daughters plac'd, To be deflowr'd by Strangers as they past, Who in her wanton Service entertain'd, Still gave the Priest and Goddess what they gain'd. Thus human Fancy toil'd in vain to find A Service grateful to the Heavenly Mind. And untaught Nature gave us a dim sight Of Divine Beings, but no further Light. Our God a Covenant with Mankind made, The Womans Seed should bruise the Serpent's Head; Then Abram's Race he for his People chose, And holy Prophets from his Loins arose. Moses more fully did his Will declare, And mighty Wonders his Credentials were: Among the rest, Error and Idols reign'd, Peculiar Gods each Legislator feign'd. At last he sent his Son to guide Mankind In Sacred Paths, of their great Duty blind; He taught us Worldly Greatness to despise, To bear Reproach, and pardon Enemies. Meekness a Virtue, till his time unknown, (Which Christians properly may call their own) He planted first, then his Apostles taught The Truths he preach'd, and Wonders that he wrought; And in their Sacred Pages 'tis alone Man finds his Duty to the Heavenly Throne. Who ever read, in Earnest or in Jest, Of any white unchang'd Immortal Beast; Or of an harmless Hind that knew no Fear, Yet fled when Hunters and the Hounds drew near? Sure never any Brute before complain'd The Common Hunt her Company disdain'd. Tell me what Young ones are unlike their Dams; Thy Tales of Hero Make, are Heathen Shams. Friend Bayes, I fear this Fable, and these Rhymes, Were thy dull Penance for some former Crimes, When thy free Muse her own brisk Language spoke, And unbaptiz'd disdain'd the Christian Yoke. Thy Spanish Fryer not thought himself reveng'd, Until thy Stile, as well as Faith, were chang'd. Our Church refus'd thee Orders, whence I find Her call'd the Panther, that of Rome the Hind. O wondrous Hind, whose White no Blood can stain Of People massacred, or Monarchs slain. Their Wealth, their Friends, and native Soil men leave, Because they can't as they are bid, believe. Some tortur'd, of their harsh Conversion die; Others the Oar in cruel Gallies ply, Till what their Hearts avow, their Lips deny. Of all the Blood in such a Quarrel spilt, Who shall absolve th'Absolvers from their Guilt? If here thy Hind has lost some vocal Blood, In France and Ireland she has spilt a Flood; Not in a Legal way, where Treason mixt With breach of Law, the double Guilt perplext. For still the boasted Martyrs on her side, Not for Religion, but for Treason dy'd: They stuck so close, that we could never part The Priest from Traytor in the Tyburn Cart, Nor yet in open Field, where Force with Force The Brave repel, and kill without remorse; But in Massacre under Charles the 9th of France, 1572. cold Blood, all Enmity laid down, Friendship and Joy restor'd throughout the Town. Supinely resting on a Monarch's Word, Ten thousand felt e'er they could fear the Sword. Lodg'd in his Palace, on pretence of care, They for Protection ran into the Snare, So rushes on the Hounds the frighted Hare. The King relenting as it nearer drew, Having the mighty Ruin full in view, Wou'd have gone back, but Zeal knew no retreat; Then kill, said he, all Hereticks you meet. Keep this black Action from succeeding time, Leave none alive, that may reproach the Crime. Now rings the fatal Bell, Death is let loose, He ranges uncontroul'd thro every House: Down every Street he pours a Purple Flood, And mounting Souls prevent their vocal Blood: The Guise not spares the Husband of his Child; Next the too easy Admiral is kill'd: A Cross their Badg, and Heretick the Word, (A strange Commission to a Christian Sword) Alike all Ranks, all Ages, Sexes fare: Thy Hind bids kill, and 'tis a Crime to spare. The Charles the 9th, and the Queen Mother. Lion and his Shaggy Dam stood by, And from their Windows clapt the Tragedy. Zeal runs through every Province with like Rage, Nor cou'd two Months the Purple Flood asswage. The Pope himself did the vast Murder bless, And gave God Publick Thanks for the Success: Before King Philip, in a Spanish Rant, Twas stil'd the Triumph of Church Militant. Thus Romish Fury like the Plague destroys, Baths in Kings Blood, and Massacres enjoys. So the third Henry fell, from the Priest's Knife; In vain Ten Legions guard His Sacred Life. The vile Assassinate thought Heaven his own, When he the more than Hellish Act had done; His Sixtus Quinens. Holiness the Murderer extol'd, And Clement in the Book of Life enrol'd. Next by Ravilliac's Hand great Henry the 4th of France. Bourbon dyes, Belov'd, and guarded by his Enemies: No publick Rage, scarce any private Frown, All but the Church submitted to the Crown, By a hot Novice's misguided Zeal, In his full Glory, that Great Hero fell. Three Sixtus Quintus, Gregory the 4th and Innocent. Popes with their Church Thunder shake his Throne, No Heretick Right their learned Clergy own: Birth-right, Descent, and Title, they declare Not to be valu'd in a Pious War; Nor wou'd the States admit him to the Crown, Till first the Church receiv'd him for her Son. Kings are but Means, Church-Greatness is the End; He has best Right who will her Right defend. Queen Mary's Reign might a just Poem make, Where Prisons, Whips, and Burning at a Stake Were common Punishments for Heresy, And almost grown familiar to the Eye. Four Reverend Prelates in blest Flames ascend, And what in Life they taught, in Death defend. Three hundred Martyrs her few Years devour, Never did Flames so highly feast before; She kill'd, and burnt, as if her cruel Mind A Vestal Fire of Hereticks design'd. Our Maiden Queen in vain the Monsieur woo'd; In vain two Popes declare against her Blood; Courtship and Malice she alike withstood, Unwearied Malice, lasting as her Breath, Teeming with Plots, Conspiracies, and Death. By a fierce Pope her Realms are given away, Spain The Spanish Expedition in 1588. fills with floting Towers the British Sea, But Heaven in Storms forbids th'unlawful Prey; And English Thunder with Celestial joins, Scatters their Fleet, and sinks their vast Designs. No sooner James on Albion's Throne was plac'd, But Rome prepares t'exalt him with a The Gunpowder Treason confest by Garnet the Priest, and others at their Execution. Blast; And in loud Flames prefer him to the Sky, While round him Lords, and scatter'd Commons fly, Short Blazing-Stars of Zealous Cruelty. Nor had it fail'd, but for a silly Scroll Sent to Monteagle from some melting Fool; Who poorly grudg'd to sacrifice a Friend To such a pious and important End: Dost thou not think him below Judas damn'd, Whom Pity thus unfainted and unman'd? Unlick'd and Independant, as thy Bear, 'Tis plain, at first, all Christian Churches were; Nor did St. Paul acknowledg Peter's Chair; But fill'd with equal Light, and equal Grace, Withstood him boldly to his Erring Face. Too strait enclos'd, he overthrew the Fence, And forc'd the Laws, unskilful to dispense. But yet for Liberty he nobly fought: That English Plant thou diggs'd up by the Root. Too far alas he carry'd his Success, The better sort oft wish'd it had been less. He chang'd the Legal for a Lawless Lord; So hard it is to rule a Conquering Sword. War has Ten thousand Mischiefs in her Womb, And fruitful Seeds of ev'ry Ill to come; Instead of Curing she provokes the Smart, Or drives the deadly Poyson to the Heart. Thy The Atheist. Apes will all thy chosen Party take, Whilst thy soft Numbers the Conversion make. Like a starv'd Dog now fauns thy quaking The Quaker. Hare, Can lye, and can dissemble, tho not swear. Puss is familiar with our Nymrods grown, Makes up the Cry to run the Panther down, And has a sort of Leopard of her own. A Motly Prince shining with inward Light, Whose unarm'd passive Subjects never fight, Drink no Man's Health, uncover not the Head, As 'twere a mark of Grace to be ill-bred: Titles because they want, they never give, Cheat in few words, and without Oaths deceive; Break for Ten thousand Pounds with Yea and Nay, And when the Spirit moves-um, run away; Proudly our Forms and Ways of speaking slight, For what's their inward Spirit but their Wit, Which good or bad is their pretended Light? This Leopard, once a Gay and Spotted Beast, A fair Hybernian Nymph wou'd have comprest; Bold in his Youth, and Lustful in his Kind, In Nightly howlings he exprest his mind. A Rival Wolf, the Terror of the Wood, Who of whole Herds had drank the reaking Blood; His Jaws well arm'd, his frightful Bristles rear'd, A dreadful Champion for the Dame appear'd: Offers the Combate, which the Leopard shuns, Forsakes the Dame, and from the Forest runs: Thus he W. P. being challeng'd by a Gentleman, turn'd Quaker, that he might not be deem'd a Coward in not accepting the Challenge. for shame and fear became a Saint, And thinks to cover all with Thred-bare Cant, With which he got a Wife for his supply, The highest Prize of their poor Lottery; Such was the doughty Scribe against the Test, From whom all Sides must learn their Interest. Thy Baptist Boar perhaps may think it odd A new-born Child should cov'nant with his God, Or go to Hell e'er he deserve the Rod. From Holy Scripture they their Doctrine draw, And may mistake, but do not break the Law; While thy Infallible presumptuous Hind To Bread alone the Eucharist confin'd, Tho Wine, as well as Bread, the Sacred Text enjoin'd. Thy graceless Fox, by Athanasius chain'd, Liberius and Felix Popes. Popes, Council held at Arles, another at Blois. Councils, Valens, Constantius, and other Emperors. Emperors, awhile maintain'd, Till the loud Nicene Hunt quite run her down, And with thy Hind confest the Three in One, Th'Eternal Father, Spirit and the Son. Tho above Sense, this does not Sense oppose, What Mortal the Divine Existence knows? The Bread we see, we handle, tast, and smell; Nor can a God within a Wafer dwell, Or be devour'd by Thousands at a time, In every Age, in every distant Clime. A Body glorify'd mends not the matter, Such things agree not with Corporeal Nature; If on the Cross he ceas'd not to complain, Can Christ be eaten now and feel no Pain? Or like Prometheus Liver grows his Flesh, That still these Eagles feed on him afresh? Heaven for our Weakness does in vain provide, Since erring Judgments may mistake the Guide, Who tho unerring, is not so to me, Unless I were Infallible as he. Thy Throne of Darkness in a Pit of Light, If not quite Nonsense, is a lofty Flight; Since either damns us, why took Heaven no care We should not sin? Yet such we should not err. Th'Omnipotence of God who dares deny? Yet that he can't destroy himself or lie, Release the Damn'd, recal the Time once past, Is on all hands without offence confest. Christ stood before his Train in open Light, With the same Body that escapes our Sight; Which had none seen, the World had not believ'd, Nay Thomas felt e'er he was undeceiv'd. If our Redeemer then appeal'd to Sense, To doubt their Verdict we have no pretence: By Godlike Acts he prov'd his Deity, The Lame he made to walk, the Blind to see; Souls to their former Mansions he restor'd, These Miracles Men saw e'er they ador'd. But say what Sense, what Miracles attest The Corp'ral Presence in the Eucharist, That lying Wonder of a coz'ning Priest; When God upheld, and Princes on their Knees, Heaven Gates he shuts, and opens as he please. All Reverence to the Word Divine is due, But Man's Deductions are not always true; The Turks, as well as we, make Faith their Guide, So all Religions in the World beside; But Faith should grafted upon Reason be, Reason the Stock, and Faith the deathless Tree. Thy Isgrim next with famish'd Face appears, A Haggard Look, Predestinating Ears, For what thou wilt still thy own Mother wears. Teaching the Scriptures of themselves are plain, And fully every saving Truth contain; He barks at Miter'd Popes in Peter's Chair, At Bishops grins, and would the Surplice tear: Among their Brethren would their Charge divide, Check their Ambition, and abate their Pride. Affirms th'Elect are the true Church, and here Since others may, Councils and Popes may err. If they alone the Scripture might explain, Christ spoke, and his Apostles writ in vain, Till they were settled in their Spiritual Reign. He grins at Picture-Worship, Saints, and Cross, And would refine the Metal from the Dross; Yet sets no foot on the Imperial Head, As fair Matilda's Gregory VII. Pope, and Henry IV. Emperor. Anno 1080. Paramour once did; When, all the Marks of Majesty laid down, Fasting and Barefoot Gregory VII. Pope, and Henry IV. Emperor. Anno 1080. Henry alone, Without his Guards, like a poor Pilgrim drest, Beg'd for Admittance, and his Guilt confest In vain, till fair Matilda us'd her Interest; Her softer Charms over his Rage prevail'd, And his Church-Thunder he at length recall'd. So Venus beg'd, and would not be deny'd, While the grim God lay panting by her Side; And in the Flames of Love half melted down, Promis'd bright Armour for the Godlike Son. These are thy Isgrim's Doctrines; tell me now Where's their Contempt of Heaven, or Kings below? I'll not exempt some Times and Men from Blame, For Priests of all Religions are the same; No not the Panther, nor thy harmless Hind; Full Power is of the persecuting Kind. Unhappy Regions, Italy and Spain, Under the Myter'd Tyrants double Reign, Where Fire and Sword, Church-unity maintain. Rome, once the gentlest Mistress of Mankind, That Arms exalted, or that Arts refin'd; Whose conquering Eagles travel'd with the Sun, And a like Race of deathless Glory run, One spreading Vertue, and the other Light Through every Region in their prosp'rous Flight; Nobly she fought, to Conquer, not Enslave, And won Renown, but Peace and Plenty gave; To injur'd Kings their Empire she renew'd, And lawless Tyrants with just Arms pursu'd, Improving still what ever she subdu'd; Is now content, under a Sp'ritual Head, And petty Dukes from his Corruption bred, Poorly to languish in inglorious Peace, Rebel to Honour, and mean Slave to Ease. The Fruitful Regions of all Italy Unpeopl'd, unmanur'd, deserted lie. Nature in vain pours forth her various Store; Rich is the Soil, but the vext Country poor, While Prince or Priest their Industry devour. So the Jackal upon the Lyon waits, And what he leaves, the hungry Vermin eats. These are the Blessings that she now enjoys, Under a Tyrant of the Conclave's Choice, Where French, or Spanish Pistols sway the Voice. Thy noble Lyon do's bought Converts hate, But Hope's a Bribe, Preferment is a Bait, And mighty Blessings on all Converts wait; Valiant they grow, and in an instant Wise, And what their Nature wants, their Faith supplys. One of these rising things who wou'd not be, That were neglected, scorn'd, decay'd like thee? Thy Church of England. Panther next appears, Spotted 'tis true, But like thy Hind, of a Celestial hew. Her generous Lyon how can she offend, Whose Sons and Writings for his Power contend? Her Duty, Cæsar and her God divide, Allowing no Supremacy beside. When expert Huntsmen had the Wood beset, All Arts, all Instruments of Ruin met; Some at his Life, some aiming at his Crown, None cou'd prevent his Fall, but Heaven alone: (Tho well content thy Hind shou'd be ensnar'd) Her Loyal Sons, thy generous Lion spar'd; Th'Exclusive Bill in the Lords House they damn'd, Pulpit and Press against the Act exclaim'd. Not so the Clergy of too Jealous Rome, Look'd on the Right of The 4th of France. Henry to come; Lest o'er the Flock one Heretick should reign, Popes with the League, the League combines with Spain. They level their Church-Thunder at his Crown, Bishops and Nobles must their King disown, Or else involv'd in the same Sentence lie, The last effect of Spiritual Tyranny. The League with Spanish Arms their King oppose; And Zeal unites, whom Nature had made Foes; Ten thousand men th'Italian Clergy send, That might their Choice of a new King defend. Our Church not thinks the Heart can go along With Prayers utter'd in an unknown Tongue, No more than how old Women can do harm With barbarous words repeated in a Charm: Nor from the Vulgar do's the Word conceal, But opens wide to all that Heavenly Weal, Where in plain words all saving Doctrines dwell. All necessary Truths are short and clear, She and th'Apostle bids us seek 'um there. Finding no Track of an unerring Guide, She sets Rome's haughty Plea to it aside; Exacts no lewd Confession to a Priest, Lodging our secret Sins in others Breasts, A burden which the Primitive Church declin'd, And which long after In the 4th Lateran Council, 1215. Innocent enjoin'd, When first he Transubstantiation coin'd. She makes no Saints, nor Pictures to adore, Obeys her Maker, and enquires no more: He Images forbid in Sacred Writ, She fears the nice distinctions of your Wit; Nor will Doulia nor Latria trust, But to the plain and Sacred Text be just. The Godhead's every where, we know not how, Such real Presence all of us allow; But that we eat his Flesh, or drink his Blood, Is neither meant, believ'd nor understood. So Jews, when their Old-Feasts they celebrate, Call 'um the bitter Herbs their Fathers eat; Not literally those which they did tast, When by their Gates th'avenging Angel past; But such as were in after-times design'd To bring that great Deliverance to their mind. From purging Flames, no Masses for the Dead At a set Price are in our Churches said, Nor act we Scriptures which all ought to read. Your antient Doctrines we indeed reject, But 'tis when elder Truths they contradict. Of new Opinions thus we stand accus'd, While we revive the Old too much abus'd. Our Reformation's new, it is confest, But our Religion is as old as Christ's. The Israelites when out of Egypt led, By Wonders rescu'd, and by Wonders fed, Did not the Substance of the Calf adore, Which was but their own Gold and Rings before. Under that Figure they ador'd their God, Who gave such Virtue to the sacred Rod; Created Locusts, that devour'd their Corn, And smote thro Pharaoh's Kingdom the first-Born; Made the Red-Sea retire on either side, Banish her rolling Waves, absent her Tide; While they upon her sandy Bosom trod, To Mortal men a new Impervious Road. Yet God those sly Idolaters abhor'd, And in their Calf disdain'd to be ador'd. Scarce holy Moses cou'd his Wrath asswage, Obtain their Pardon, and disarm his Rage; Yet they directed their Intention right, The Calf but brought their God before their sight; What pleads thy Hind more than these Wretches might? The Wolf and Bear too lately she escap'd, In their rough Paws to be again entrap'd, They but forsook her for resembling thee, Worst Foe to man's and Christian's Liberty; O Hind unchang'd! but 'tis in Cruelty. To their mistaken sight she did appear No Panther, but a sort of spotted Deer, That might, when past the Glorys of her Prime, Grow grey with Age, and become white in time. They thought unlighted Tapers useless things, Absurd as Altars without Offerings; That Real Presence might grow Corporal, And Men from Kneeling to Adoring fall. Tho she resemble thee alas too much, With Joy they find she never will be such; She like a Loving Spouse endur'd it long, And much abus'd, dissembled with the Wrong; Till driven from the Table, she withdrew, Forc'd from the Board, she left the Houshold too; And never will the odious Tye renew. Where is it said a Priest shall have no Wife? Where's the command for a Monastick Life? Our Wise Creator bid us fill the Land, And shall we vow to break his first Command? Our Sons and Daughters into Convents thrust, And their hot Youth with untam'd Fryers trust? 'Tis true, they pay a sort of forc'd Consent, But Pride and Friends forbid 'em to repent; Like Cowards in a Battel they go on, Asham'd and loth to run away alone; Till tam'd by Custom and benum'd with Age, Like Birds long kept they cannot leave the Cage. A Rosy-colour'd Face Religion shews, This every Convent, and Fat Abby knows. The Pride of Cardinals, what Pen can trace? When they appear, the Royal Blood gives place; They may on Earth but by the Pope be try'd, To kill 'um is a sort of Parricide. This The 3d of France. Henry found; the Guise unheeded falls, But Bourbons Blood for the Church-Thunder calls; Paris and Orleans reject his Reign, And Sorbon Doctors their Revolt maintain, Affirming that the People safely might Against their King, when thus excommun'd, fight. See here the boasted Loyalty of Rome, And by their past, expect their Faith to come. Men need not fear how they their Lives pollute, Penance and Fasts kind Father will commute, The Price of Sins they reasonably compute. A tedious Lent th'Arabian Prophet made, But Dispensations were no Eastern Trade; His temperate Law the Joys of Wine abhor'd, When he plurality of Wives restor'd; Wisely foreseeing that Excess might spoil The wish'd Increase of his unpeopled Soil; Indulging thence their Nobler Appetites, His new Religion to the Clime he fits. But Natures Frailtys both alike relieve, The Turks allow but what your Priests forgive. The Text which bids a Bishop have one Wife, Excuses Luther in his Married Life; Nor has that Sacred Bed such Joys of Love, To be mistook for Bacchannals above. 'Tis true, our Church is to our Isle confin'd, No cruel Swords inforce it on Mankind; No harsh Conversions stain our peaceful Faith, Ours are th'Effects of Charity, not Wrath; While Turks their Errors with their Empire spread, And from Dragoons our Neighbours learn their Creed. Japan and China with your Priests abound, And Mass is said wherever Gain is found. What Swede, what Norway Converts can you boast? You never trade to any barren Coast. Your Zeal burns dim, benum'd with Northern Cold, But flames and rages in the Climes of Gold. Once for three Years the Church had lost her Head, Princes and Cardinals in no Pope agreed. At length the weary'd Faction with one Voice To Cardinal Dossa left the Sacred Choice. He nam'd himself, defeating all their Hopes, And shew'd us a new way of making Popes. Urban and Clement did the Gregory at Rome, Benedict at Avignion, and Alexander chosen at Pisa under Charles the VI. See Mezeray, Thuanus, and other French Historians. 1409. World divide: Scarce forty Years cou'd the dark Right decide. Councils and Cardinals both their Titles damn'd, And Alexander a third Pope proclaim'd. Where all this time was Rome's unerring Guide? Did he in none, or in all three reside? Saint Peter cou'd no Successor declare, He Clement nam'd, but Linus took the Chair. If Popes be doubtful, who can Priesthood trust? For if they fail, their long Succession must. Since then false Popes as well as true ordain'd, How can Rome's Holy Orders be maintain'd? By Otho's Arms assisted, the Twelfth John, Not full eighteen, his Papacy began: His Mind was bloody, few and leud his Days; His great Imperial Patron he betrays, Assists his Foe; but Otho overcome, And drove th'ingrateful Stripling out of Rome. His Life in Corners he awhile prolong'd; But fell at last by one whose Bed he wrong'd. Sergius by force of Arms the Chair obtain'd, And Pepin's Right Pope Zachary maintain'd: Grandchild to Pepin, who his King dethron'd At Rome, so early was Rebellion own'd. And Valentine a Deacon, not a Priest, Chosen by all, the Holy Seat possest. Silvester on his Deathbed did declare, The Devil and Magick plac'd him in the Chair. Clement in pangs of Poison ends his days, And Damasus, that gave it, takes the Place. Victor the Third dy'd of a poisonous Sup; And prov'd that more than Blood was in the Cup. The Popedom virtuous Celestine the I. Celestine resign'd, The Sacred Charge he consciously declin'd; Warn'd not anights by Heaven, as he thought, But by Impostors Benedict had taught, In broken Voices to disturb his Rest; And tell him God was with his Reign displeas'd. The pious Hermit caught in that false Snare, Retires, and Benedict assumes the Chair, Leaving the Hermit to the Jaylor's Care. After the Death of Clement it appears, The Holy Seat was vacant for two Years. Where in those Days was Rome's unerring Guide? Who thus omitted, might be laid aside. Full forty Years his Holiness was split, Half did at Rome, half at Avignion sit. Each fiercely by his Followers maintain'd, Both Wonders forg'd, and Revelations feign'd. By temporal Arms both Popes assert their Right, Princes and Nobles in both Parties fight. John by a Council which at Constance met, For Crimes and Vices was expel'd the Seat; Which to confirm by Edict, they proclaim, That next to Christ, a Council was Supreme. Henry the Second made the Romans swear, Without his leave not to confer the Chair. He from a Pope receiv'd th'Imperial Crown, But claim'd a Right to give the Triple one. Thus sometimes Popes made Emperors, and then They took upon 'em to make Popes agen. Each propping at their need with others Might, The weak Foundations of injurious Right. So Phocas, when he had the Hate incur'd Of his own Clergy for his murder'd Lord, At Rome for lawful Emperor was own'd, As if by Choice, or long Descent enthron'd. He first (with that vile Flattery beguil'd) Head of the Church the Roman Bishop stil'd. None but Apelles might the Conqueror paint; We want a Juvenal to draw this Saint. His Holiness, a Father now indeed, Might damn Election, and let Blood succeed. John his First-born was Earl of Candia made, Cæsar a Cardinal, of's Father's trade. Jeffry the Third we Prince Squillaci find, And bright Lucretia to Duke of Ferara. Alphonso join'd. These were the Comforts of his private Life, While fair Vannocchia was esteem'd his Wife; E'er wild Ambition taught him to aspire, Or worldly Pomp misled his vain Desire: But when once Pope, his Vice grew Villany, A doubtful Friend, a cruel Enemy; Faithless and Proud, oppressive was his Reign, His Lust was Avarice, his God was Gain: He brib'd the Conclave, and the Popedom bought, But to just Ruin the vile Card'nal brought; He Banish'd, Poison'd, or Imprison'd most Of those Red-Caps, that put him to that Cost. Cæsar with Arms lays wast his native Soil, And with the French divides the odious Spoil; And for Reward of his unnatural War, Is promis'd Realms with Albret of Navarre: But under vast Designs vast Treasures fail, Places and Card'nals Caps are set to sale; Extortion, Violence, and Simony, Groan with the weight of War and Luxury. Had Magus liv'd till now, and offer'd most, Saint Peter's Heir had sold the Holy Ghost, Dock'd the Entail, and the Succession crost. All Projects failing, Murder is decreed, But yet the Sacred Scarlet must not bleed, Tho to their Wealth his Holiness succeed. At Belvidere he makes a treacherous Feast, Card'nals and wealthy Prelates are the Guests; Where liquid Death, in private Bottels plac'd, Attends the Cup th'invited Card'nals tast; But by mistake, or Heaven's immediate Care, He and his Son the deadly Potion share: Thus damn'd and murder'd by himself he dies, A wicked Priest, but worthy Sacrifice. So many Villanies no long Race affords, Nor rude Election of Pretorian Swords, As have succeeded to this Sacred Chair; They can usurp, kill, poison, but not err. A General Council cannot err, some say, Yet every Priest is Fallible, and may; The Army can't, each Man may run away. Heaven fix'd Salvation to the Name of Christ; Whom he redeem'd, why damns the Popish Priest? Believe in him, you have Eternal Life; Make not the God of Peace the Subject of your Strife. Christ said, the Gates of Hell should not prevail Against the Church, nor should she ever fail; Who knows but that the Spirit might intend, To use Reformers to that Sacred end? Differ we may, yet all have saving Faith, Go the same Journey, tho each chuse his Path. Error and Sin attend us here below, That God that pardons Sin, will pardon Error too. Were Picture-Worship no Idolatry, I think it so, and 'twere a Crime in me; Tho feign'd Conversion may the World deceive, Men must be sav'd by what themselves believe. This found thy Lion, and our Peace proclaim'd, Calm'd our Dissensions, and our Fury tam'd. The Panther, Wolf, the Hind, the Fox, the Hare, And the whole Forest his Protection share; The Ark did not more peacefully contain Their warring Kinds, than his impartial Reign; Truly devout, with an indulgent Eye, He nobly views all sorts of Piety: His generous Nature Persecution hates, Heaven's easier Methods patiently he waits; Thought by Experience that no outward Force Can stop Religion's Immaterial Course: Men Threats, and Death, and Torture not regard, Whose thoughts are fix'd on the sublime Reward: Their ravish'd Fancies ev'n in Flames delight, And Heaven descends expanded to their sight; With Grief, not Rage, he views the wandring Flock, And sandy Cots, not founded on the Rock; Born to Command, and forward to Controul, His trembling Conscience checks his daring Soul. No harsh Submission to his Will we pay, Fearing we love, and loving we obey; Deceit he scorns, and Force he will not use, But by like means his great Designs pursues. His Word he never, nor his Friend forgets, His Smiles are Promises, and Frowns are Threats; No idle Talk, no Laughter shakes the Room, No loose Buffoons on their lewd Jests presume; His Mirth is Royal, Pleasures are severe, The Neighing Steed and Trumpet charm his Ear. He flourishes that Sword he knows to use, And the old Terror of our Arms renews. Hunting (that flattering Image of the War) Does but his Limbs for nobler Toils prepare. Th'Extremes of Heat and Cold he learns to slight, And sees the short Defence of trembling Flight; Whether on foot he take his certain Aim, Or on his fiery Steed pursue the Game. Business and well-arm'd Troops his Time divide, And War appears in all her harmless Pride; Like a young Lion e'er he tast of Blood, While from his Dam he draws his easy Food; E'er Rage or Hunger drive him thro the Plains, Of flying Herds to drink the reaking Veins. Nor will out fierce Ambitious Neighbour dare Provoke a Prince so well prepar'd for War; Nor home-bred Treason show her odious Face, Doubly subdu'd by Arms and Acts of Grace. The Ax may cut off Traytors as they sprout, But Mercy digs up Treason by the Root; Above the Forms, yet true to the Intent Of Law, he steers his steddy Government; And only stretches his Prerogative, To ease th'Opprest and let Offenders live. So swift a Pity do's his Wrath succeed, His fiercest Foes, but for Example bleed; Not like those Princes who decline the Weight, And glorious Toils of their exalted State: By Heaven entrusted, and assisted too, He will no Partner of his Cares allow. His Mind has Motions perfectly her own; And the firm Springs to Mortals are unknown. The Crafty Courtier knows not where to bribe, Nor where to cringe, nor fawn, the starving Tribe Of a free Gift the charming Force he knows; Unimportun'd, his Royal Bounty flows, Like the ripe Clusters of the generous Vine, Whose unprest running makes the noblest Wine. The Zeal of Priests he curbs in the Debate, When he determines the Affairs of State. Thus freed from their vile Fears, his Royal Mind That wise Indulgence for all Sects design'd; He saw us languish, and our Trade decay, Our Bankers break, our Seamen run away; Our Churches fill'd with a dividing Herd, Who but our Temples to our Jayls prefer'd. Others of God, more than of Man afraid, To Foreign Parts our gainful Trades convey'd. Some for Plantations left their native Soil, Their Wealth and Ease, for Poverty and Toil. No Taxes, no Oppression, vext the Land; Yet Power and Wealth he saw were at a stand. His piercing Judgment the Disease descry'd; His Goodness the blest Remedy apply'd; Not like those Hirelings who had rather kill With common Drugs, than hazard their own Skill: But like a Father, and Physician too, He trys the utmost that his Art can do; Secure that at his Pleasure he can stop The doubtful Medicine, shou'd the Patient droop. Let Commonwealths boast Liberty no more, She thrives as well beneath the Lyons Roar; Not as with them, mean, sordid and ill-bred, But like the Partner of a Royal Bed: With all the Decent Charms of Beauty grac'd, And next her Lord in Veneration plac'd, Her Lord, from whom this Blessing we receive, Greater than some thought Monarchy cou'd give. Quintus Arbelius to Charles Lord H?. Take Courage, Noble Charles, and cease to muse; I came from t'other World to bring thee News: I'm Quint' Arbelius in black Scylla's time, Proscribed then, and for no other Crime, Than that my Lands in fair Albania's Field Were pleasant there, and did much Profit yield. Take Courage Man, for that thou hast a Charm, Thy pleasant Lands can never do thee harm: And yet thy Faults are worse, far worse than Mine; My Lands my Faults were, and thy Place is thine. Thy Faults are worse, for I, poor silly Fool, Had no Ambition, nor a Soul to rule: But thou, Great Charles, the Glory of that Court, Thy Master's Crown and Honour didst support; Thou kepst those Vipers from that Sacred Head: But the great Patron of Mankind is dead; And now they spit their Venom, set their Sting On thee, and all that lov'd that Glorious King. But 'tis a Crime enough in any Case To keep, when Men in Power want a Place. Take Courage Charles, for I this Comfort bring, The Heav'ns, that did protect and love that King, After some Tryal thou shalt surely find To all his Friends propitious and kind, More wou'd I tell thee, but th'approach of Day Forces us Shadows to make hast away. On King William the III. Great Nassau, from his Cradle to his Grave, Oppos'd by those whom he was born to save; Whilst every Check mounted his Glory higher, Forc'd such as would not love, yet to admire. Thoughtfully Wise, sedately Fierce and Brave, He Conquer'd to Deliver, not t'Enslave: Saviour of Nations, Tyranny's sworn Fo, Faithful himself, and Faith's Defender too. Three Crowns the Royal Hero's Head adorn'd, And thrice three Nations at his Funeral mourn'd. The Belgick, with the British Lions groan, Th'Imperial Eagle drooping sits alone, Sad Europe doth its Champion's Loss bemoan. Having outdone all that is Great below, To find an Equal he to Heav'n did go. Heav'n, that so long his Godlike Soul had fir'd, Now crowns that Virtue which it self inspir'd, And which it self, as well as Earth admir'd. FINIS. POSTSCRIPT. The following Poem should have been inserted in Pag. 432. it being an Answer to the Advice to a Painter, which begins Pag. 428. especially that Part of it which relates to K. W. And must the Hero that redeem'd our Land, Here in the Front of this base Tablet stand? The Man, the more than Man, that left his Ease, And crost so oft the faithless boistrous Seas; That paid an annual Tribute of his Life, To guard Britannia from the Murderer's Knife? Must He, the Brave, the Pious, and the Just, Adorn these Scenes of Tyranny and Lust? O! my Blood boils, my Spirit's all on Flame! Curse on the Poet, Darkness on his Name! Methinks the Skies should lower, just Thunder roll, And Lightning blast the Villain to the Soul. Audacious Wretch! to stab a Monarch's Fame, And blow his Subjects to a rebellious Flame; To call the Painter to his black Designs, To draw our Guardian's Face in hellish Lines! Painter forbear: The Monarch can be shown Under no Shape but Angels or his own, Gabriel or William on the British Throne. O! cou'd my Thoughts but sute the vast Design, Or Words with Infinite Ideas join, I'd rouse Apelles from his Iron Sleep, And bid him trace the Conqu'ror o'er the Deep; Trace him, Apelles, on the Belgian Plain, Fierce climbing o'er the Mountains of the Slain, Scattering just Vengeance thro the red Campagn. Then dash the Canvass with a flying Stroke, Till it be lost in Clouds of Fire and Smoke, And say, it was the Conqu'ror thro the Squadrons broke. Heav'ns! how he leaves the Pleasures of a Throne, And makes his Peoples Dangers all his own. Now Noble Pencil, lead him to our Isle; Mark how the Skies with joyful Glories smile: Wash off the Blood, and take a peaceful Teint. All red the Warrior, white the Ruler paint; Abroad a Hero, and at home a Saint. Throne him on high upon a shining Seat, Lust and Profaneness dying at his Feet; Laurels about his Head, and may they blow With flowry Blessings ever on his Brow. Place at his Hand the Volume of the Laws, Whence his Imperial Commands he draws. Let Liberty and Right, with Plumes display'd, Clap their glad Wings around his Sacred Head. Describe the Vertues that his Actions teach, His Soul inspires us what his Prophets preach. His Soul inspires, and, wide as his Command, Scatters his brave Example thro the Land. Not so the former Reigns— Bend down his Ear to each afflicted Cry, And paint the generous Mercy in his Eye. But O! the Love, the Pity of his Breast; 'Tis not to be by Art or Words exprest: Stop Pencil here, for we must think the rest. Now Muse, pursue the Satyrist again, Wipe off the Blots of his invenom'd Pen. Hark how he bids the servile Painter draw, In monstrous Shapes, the Patrons of our Law; And at one dash he crosses every Name From the Records of Honesty and Fame. This scribling Fool makes every Man a Knave, Shoots all his Bolts promiscuous at the Base and Brave; And with unpardonable Malice sheds Poison and Spite on undistinguish'd Heads. Painter forbear; or if thy bolder Hand Dares to attempt the Villains of the Land, First draw this Poet like some baleful Star, With silent Influence shedding Civil War, Or factious Trumpeter, whose Magick Sound Calls off the Subjects to the hostile Ground, And scatters hellish Feuds the Nations round. These are the Imps of Hell, the cursed Tribe, That make the Plagues and Mischiefs they describe. Draw just above the Great ones of our Isle, Still from the Good distinguishing the Vile: Set these in Pomp, in Grandeur and Command, Peeling the Subjects with a greedy Hand. Paint out the Knaves that have the Nation sold, And tinge their meagre Looks with sordid Gold. Mark how a slavish Faction undermines The Pious Monarch's generous Designs; Spoil their own Native Land, as Vipers do, Vipers that tear their Mothers Bowels thro. Let Great NASSAU beneath a careful Crown, With Eyes of Pity and just Rage, be drawn; Grieving to see how weak his Labour proves, To save the stubborn Nation that he loves. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. III. From the Year 1640. to the Year 1704. On Purgatory. When the Almighty did his Palace frame, That glorious shining Place he Heav'n did name: And when the first Rebellious Angels fell, He doom'd them to a certain Place, call'd Hell. There's Heav'n and Hell confirm'd in Sacred Story: But yet I ne'er could read of Purgatory, That Priests have fram'd for the good Roman Race: Our Maker never thought of such a Place. It is a Place sure somewhere under ground; Where sinful Souls lie fluxing till they're sound. O Rome! we own thee for a learn'd wise Nation, To add a Place wanting in God' Creation. Satire upon Romish Confessors. By Mr. Dryden. Our Church alas! as Rome objects, does want These Ghostly Comforts for the falling Saint; This gains them their Whore-Converts, and may be One Reason of the Growth of Popery. So Mahomet's Religion came in fashion. By the large leave it gave to Fornication. Fear not the Guilt if you can pay for't well; There is no Dives in the Roman Hell. Gold opens the strait Gate, and lets him in, But want of Mony is a mortal Sin. For all besides you may discount to Heav'n, And drop a Bead to keep the Tallies ev'n. How are Men cozen'd still with shews of Good! The Bawd's best Mask is the grave Friar's Hood. The Vice no more a Clergy-man displeases, Than Doctors can be thought to hate Diseases: 'Tis by your living ill, that they live well; By your Debauches their fat Paunches swell. 'Tis a Mock-War between the Priest and Devil, When they think fit, they can be very civil. As some who did French Counsels most advance, To blind the World have rail'd in Print at France. Thus do the Clergy at our Vices baul, That with more ease they may engross them all. By damning ours, they do their own maintain; A Church-man's Godliness is always Gain. Hence to their Prince they will superior be, And Civil Treason grows Church-Loyalty. They boast the Gift of Heav'n is in their Power, Well may they give the God they can devour. Still to the sick and dead their Claims they lay, For 'tis on Carrlon that the Vermin prey. Nor have they less Dominion on our Life, They trot the Husband, and they pace the Wife. Rouze up, ye Cuckolds of the Northern Climes, And learn from Sweden to prevent such Crimes. Unman the Friar, leave the holy Drone To hum in his forsaken Hive alone; He'll work no Honey, when his Sting is gone. Your Wives and Daughters soon will leave the Cells, When they have loft the Sound of Aaron's Bells. The Robber robb'd. A certain Priest had hoarded up A Mass of secret Gold; And where he might bestow it safe, He knew not to be bold. At last it came into his Thought To lock it in a Chest, Within the Chancel; and he wrote Thereon, Hic Deus est. A merry Grig, whose greedy Mind Did long for such a Prey, Respecting not the sacred Words That on the Casket lay; Took out the Gold, and blotting out The Priest's Inscript thereon, Wrote, Resurrexit, non est hic: Your God is rose and gone. PARADOX. That Ambition, or the Desire of Rule and Superiority, is a Virtue. This is a Truth so certain, and so clear, That to the first-born Man it did appear. Did not the mighty Heir, the noble Cain, By the fresh Laws of Nature taught, disdain That, tho a Brother, any one should be A greater Favorite to God than he? He struck him down; And so, said he, so fell The Sheep, which thou didst sacrifice so well. Since all the fullest Sheaves that I could bring, Since all were blasted in the Offering; Lest God should my next Victim too despise, The acceptable Priest I'll sacrifice. Hence Coward Fears: for the first Blood so spilt, As a Reward, he the first City built. 'Twas a Beginning generous and high, Fit for a Grand-Child of the Deity. So well advanc'd, 'twas pity there he stay'd; One step of Glory more he should have made, And to the utmost bounds of Greatness gone; Had Adam too been kill'd he might have reign'd alone. One Brother's Death what do I mean to name? A small Oblation to Revenge and Fame: The mighty-soul'd Abimelech, to shew What for high Place a higher Spirit can do, Almost a Hecatomb of Brothers slew. And seventy times in nearest Blood he dy'd (To make it hold) his Royal Purple Pride. Why do I name the Lordly Creature Man? The weak, the mild, the coward Woman can, When to a Crown she cuts her sacred way, All that oppose with Manlike Courage slay. So Athaliah, when she saw her Son, And with his Life her dearer Greatness gone, With a Majestick Fury slaughter'd all, Whom high Birth might to high Pretences call. Since he was dead, who all her Power sustain'd, Resolv'd to reign alone: Resolv'd and reign'd. In vain her Sex, in vain the Laws withstood, In vain the sacred Plea of David's Blood. A noble and a bold Contention she (One Woman) undertook with Destiny: She to pluck down, Destiny to uphold (Oblig'd by holy Oracles of old) The great Jessæan Race on Judah's Throne, Till 'twas at last an equal Wager grown, Scarce Fate, with much ado, the better got by one. Tell me not she her self at last was slain; Did she not first seven Years, a Life-time reign? Seven Royal Years to a publick Spirit will seem More than the private Life of a Methusalem. 'Tis God-like to be great; and as they say, A thousand Years to God are but a Day: So to a Man, when once a Crown he wears, The Coronation Day's more than a thousand Years. BRUTUS. 1. Excellent Brutus! of all Human Race The best, till Nature was improv'd by Grace: Till Faith above themselves had rais'd Men more, Than Reason above Beasts before. Virtue was thy Life's Centre, and from thence Did silently and constantly dispense The gentle, vigorous Influence To all the wide and fair Circumference; And all the Parts upon it lean'd so easily, Obey'd the mighty Force so willingly, That none could Discord or Disorder see, In all their Contrariety. Each had his Motion nat'ral and free, And the whole no more mov'd, than the whole World could be. 2. From thy strict Rule some think that thou didst swerve (Mistaken honest Men) in Cæsar's Blood: What Mercy could the Tyrant's Life deserve From him, who kill'd himself rather than serve? Th' Heroick Exaltations of the Good Are so far from being understood, We count them Vice. Alas! our sight's so ill, That things which swiftest move, seem to stand still. We look not upon Virtue in her height, On her supreme Idea brave and bright, In th'original Light. But as her Beams reflected pass Thro' our own Nature, or ill Custom's Glass; And 'tis no wonder so, If with dejected Eye, In standing Pools we seek the Sky, That Stars so high above should seem to us below. 3. Can we stand by and see Our Mother robb'd, and bound, and ravish'd be, Yet not to her Assistance stir, Pleas'd with the Strength and Beauty of the Ravisher? Or shall we fear to kill him, if before The cancell'd Name of Friend he bore? Ingrateful Brutus do they call? Ingrateful Cæsar, who could Rome enthrall! An Act more barbarous and unnatural, (In th'exact Ballance of true Virtue try'd) Than his Successor Nero's Parricide. There's none but Brutus could deserve That all Men else should wish to serve, And Cæsar's usurp'd Place to him should proffer; None can deserve't but he who would refuse the Offer. 4. Ill Fate assum'd a Body thee t'affright, And wrapt it self i'th' Terrors of the Night; I'll meet thee at Philippi, said the Spright: I'll meet thee there, saidst thou, With such a Voice, and such a Brow, As put the trembling Ghost to sudden flight: It vanish'd as a Taper's Light Goes out, when Spirits appear in sight; One would have thought t'had heard the Morning Crow, Or seen her well appointed Star Come marching up the Eastern Hill afar. Nor durst it in Philippi's Field appear, But unseen attack'd thee there. Had it presum'd in any shape thee t'oppose, Thou would'st have forc'd it back upon thy Foes: Or slain't like Cæsar, tho it be A Conqueror and a Monarch mightier far than he. 5. What Joy can human things to us afford, When we see perish thus, by odd Events, Ill Men and wretched Accidents, The best Cause and best Man that ever drew a Sword? When we see The false Octavius, and wild Anthony, God-like Brutus, conquer thee? What can we say but thy own Tragick Word; That Virtue, which had worship'd been by thee, As the most Good, and greatest Deity, By this fatal Proof became An Idol only, and a Name? Hold, noble Brutus, and restrain The bold Voice of thy generous Disdain: These mighty Gulphs are yet Too deep for all thy Judgment, and thy Wit. The Time's set forth already which shall quell Stiff Reason, when it offers to rebel; Which these great Secrets shall unseal, And new Philosophies reveal. A few years more, so soon hadst thou not dy'd, Would have confounded human Virtue's Pride, And shewn thee a GOD crucify'd. ODE. In Answer to the former. 1. 'Tis said, that Favourite Mankind Was made the Lord of all below, But yet the doubtful are concern'd to find; 'Tis only one Man tells another so. And for this vast Dominion here, Which over other Beasts we claim, Reason our best Credential does appear, By which indeed we domineer; But how absurdly, we may see with shame. Reason, that solemn Trifle! light as Air! Mov'd with each Blast of Censure or Applause; By partial Love away 'tis blown, Or the least Prejudice can weigh it down: Thus our high Privilege becomes our Snare. In any nice and weighty Cause How wavering are the Wisest! yet the Grave Impose on that small Judgment which we have. 2. In Works of Fame, whose Names have spread so wide, And ev'n the Force of Time defy'd, Some Failings yet may be descry'd; Among the rest with wonder be it told, That Brutus is ador'd for Cæsar's Death; By which he still survives in Fame's immortal Breath. Brutus! ev'n he of all the rest, In whom we should that Deed the most detest, Is of Mankind esteem'd the best! As Snow descending from some lofty Hill Is by its rolling course augmenting still, So from illustrious Authors down has roll'd Till now, that Rev'rence he receiv'd of old: Still ev'ry Age adds a profound Esteem, And gild their Eloquence with Praise of him. But Truth unveil'd, like a bright Sun appears, To shine away this Heap of seventeen hundred Years. 3. In vain 'tis urg'd by an illustrious Wit, To whom I otherwise submit, That Cæsar's Life no Pity could deserve From one who kill'd himself rather than serve. Had Brutus chose rather himself to slay, Than any Master to obey, Happy for Rome had been that noble Pride! The World had then remain'd in Peace, and only Brutus dy'd: For he, whose Virtue would disdain to own Subjection to a Tyrant's Frown, And his own Life had rather end, Would sure much rather kill himself, than only hurt his Friend. To his own Sword in the Philippian Field, Brutus indeed at last did yield; But in those times such Actions were not rare, And then proceeded only from Despair; Else he perhaps had chose to live In hopes another Cæsar would forgive: That so he might for publick Good once more Conspire against a Life, which had spar'd his before. 4. Our Country claims indeed our chiefest Care, And in our Thoughts deserves the tender'st share. Her to a thousand Friends we should prefer, But not betray 'em, tho it be for her. Hard is his Heart whom no Desert can move, A Wife, a Mistress, or a Friend to love Above whate'er he does besides enjoy: But may he for their sakes his Sire, or Sons destroy? Sacred be all the Ties of publick Good, We to our Country owe our dearest Blood: To suffer in her Service were a Bliss, And ev'n to fall, the noblest Fate that is. So brave a Death, tho in Youth's early Bloom, Is above all the longest Life to come; But 'tis not surely of so great Renown, To take another's, as to lose our own. Of all that's ours, we cannot give too much, But what belongs to Friendship, O! 'tis Sacrilege to touch. 5. Can we stand by unmov'd, and see Our Mother robb'd and ravish'd? Can we be Excus'd, if in her Cause we never stir; Pleas'd with the Strength and Beauty of the Ravisher? Thus sings our Bard with almost Heat Divine; 'Tis pity that his Thought was not as strong as fine: Would it more justly did the Case express; Or that its Beauty, and its Grace were less. (Thus a loose Nymph sometimes we see, Who so charming seems to be, That, jealous of a soft Surprize, We scarce dare trust our eager Eyes) So dangerous an Ambush to escape, We shall not plead a willing Rape. A valiant Son would be provok'd the more; A Force we therefore must confess, but acted long before. A Marriage since did intervene, With all the solemn, and the sacred Scene; Loud was the Hymenæan Song, The violated Rome. Dame walk'd smilingly along: And in the midst of the most sacred Dance, As if enamour'd of his Sight, Often she cast a kind admiring Glance On the bold Strugler for Delight: Who afterwards appear'd so moderate and cool, As if for publick Good alone he so aspir'd to rule. 6. But O! that this were all the Muse could urge Against a Roman of so great a Soul! And that fair Truth permitted us to purge His Fact of what appears so foul! Friendship! that sacred and sublimest thing! The noblest Quality, and chiefest Good! (In this base Age scarce understood) Inspires us with unusual Warmth its injur'd Rights to sing. Assist, ye Angels, whose immortal Bliss, Tho more refin'd, chiefly consists in this. How plainly your bright Thoughts to one another shine! O! how you all agree in Harmony Divine! The course of mutual Love with equal Zeal you run: A course as far from any end, as when at first begun. You saw, and smil'd at this most wretched Pair, Who did betwixt them both so many Virtues share. Some which belong to Peace, and some to Strife, Those of a calm and of an active Life, That all the Excellence of Human Kind Concur'd to make of both but one united Mind. Which Friendship did so fast and closely bind, Not the least Cement could appear by which their Souls were join'd. That Tie which holds our mortal Frame, Which poor unknowing We a Soul and Body name, Seems not a Composition more Divine, Or more abstruse than all that does in Friendship shine. 7. From mighty Cæsar's boundless Grace Brutus indeed his Life receiv'd; But Obligations, tho so great believ'd, We count but slight in such a case: Where Friendship so possesses all the Place, There is no room for Gratitude; since he Who so obliges is more pleas'd than his sav'd Friend can be. Just in the midst of all this noble Heat, While their great Hearts did both so kindly beat, That it amaz'd the Lookers-on, And forc'd them to suspect a Cæsar was suspected to have begotten Brutus. Father and a Son: (Yet here ev'n Nature's self did seem to be out-done) From such a Friendship unprovok'd to fall Is Crime enough: But O! that such a Crime were all, Which does, with too much cause, ungrateful Brutus call. 8. He calmly laid a long Design Against his best and dearest Friend, Did all his Care and Credit bend To spirit others up to work his barbarous End; Himself the Centre where they all did join. Cæsar mean time, fearless, and fond of him, Was as industrious all the while To give such ample Marks of his Esteem, As made the gravest Romans smile To see with how much ease Love can the Wise beguile. For he, whom Brutus deem'd to bleed, Did, setting his own Race aside, No less a thing for him provide, Than to the World's great Empire to succeed. Which we are bound in Justice to allow, Is all-sufficient Proof to show, That Brutus did not strike for his own sake; And if, alas! he fail'd, 'twas only by mistake. A Preparative to Study: Or, the Virtue of Sack. Written in the Year 1641. Fetch me Ben Johnson's Skull, and fill't with Sack, Rich as the same he drank, when all the pack Of jolly Sisters pledg'd, and did agree, It was no Sin to be as drunk as he; If there be any Weakness in the Wine, There's Virtue in the Cup to make't Divine. This muddy Drench of Ale does taste too much Of Earth, the Malt retains a scurvy touch Of the dull Hind that sow'd it, and I fear There's Heresy in Hops; give Calvin Beer, And his precise Disciples, such as think There's Powder-Treason in all Spanish Drink, Call Sack an Idol: we will kiss the Cup, For fear their Conventicle be blown up With Superstition: away with Brew-house Alms, Whose best Mirth is Six-shilling Beer and Psalms. Let me rejoice in sprightly Sack, that can Create a Brain ev'n in an empty Pan. Canary! it is thou that dost inspire And actuate the Soul with Heavenly Fire. Thou that sublim'st the Genius, mak'st the Wit Scorn Earth, and such as love or live by it; Thou mak'st us Lords of Regions large and fair, While our pleas'd Thoughts build Castles in the Air. Since Fire, Earth, Air, thus thy Inferiors be, Henceforth I'll know no Elements but thee. Welcome thou Juice Divine! Mankind's Delight; By thee my gladsom Muse begins her Flight: I would not leave thee, Sack, to be with Jove, His Nectar is but feign'd, but I, blest I, do prove Thy more essential Worth. I am methinks In the Exchequer now, hark how it chinks: I now esteem my venerable Self As brave a Fellow as if all that Pelf Were sure mine own, and I have thought a way Already how to spend it; I would pay No Debts, but fairly empty every Trunk; And change the Gold for Sack to keep me drunk, To keep me drunk, until Spain's gen'rous Wine So seiz'd my Crown, that th'Indies too were mine. And when my Brains are once afloat (Heav'n bless us) I think my self a better Man than Crœsus. I fancy now my self to be a Judg, And coughing, laugh, to see the Clients trudg After my Lordship's Coach unto the Hall For Justice, and am full of Law withal, And do become the Bench as well as he That fled of late for want of Honesty. But I'll be Judg no longer, tho in jest, For fear I shou'd be talk'd with like the rest. When I am sober, who can chuse but think Me wise, that am so wary in my Drink? O admirable Sack! here's dainty Sport, I am come back from Westminster to Court, And am grown young again, my Ptysick now Hath left me, and my Judges graver Brow Is smooth'd, and I turn'd amorous as May, When she invites young Lovers forth to play Upon her flowry Bosom; I cou'd win A Vestal now, or tempt a Saint to sin. O, for a score of Queens! you'd laugh to see How they wou'd strive, which first shou'd ravish me. Three Goddesses were nothing: Sack has tipt My Tongue with Charms like those which Paris sipt From Venus, when she taught him how to kiss Fair Helen, and invite a farther Bliss. Mine is Canary-Rhetorick, that alone Would turn Diana to a burning Stone, Stone with Amazement burning with Love's Fire, Hard to the Touch, but short in her Desire. Inestimable Sack! thou mak'st us rich, Wise, amorous, any thing; I have an itch To t'other Cup, and that perchance will make Me valiant too, and quarrel for thy sake. If I be once inflam'd against thy Foes, That would preach down thy Worth in Small-beer Prose, I shall do Miracles, as bad or worse, Than he that gave the King a hundred Horse: I'm in the North already; Lesley's dead, He that wou'd rise, carry the King his Head, And tell him (if he ask, who kill'd the Scot) I knock'd his Brains out with a pottel Pot. Out ye rebellious Vipers, I'm come back From thence again, because there's no good Sack: T'other odd Cup, and I shall be prepar'd To snatch at Stars, and pluck down a Reward With my own Hands from Jove upon their Back, That are, or Charles's Foes, or Foes to Sack. Let it be full, and if I chance to spill, Over my Standish by the way, I will, Dipping in this Diviner Ink my Pen, Write my self sober, and fall to't again. ODE. Written soon after O. Cromwel's Death. 1 Curst be the Man! (what do I wish? as tho The Wretch already were not so) But curst on let him be, who thinks it brave And great, his Country to enslave; Who seeks to overpoise alone The Ballance of a Nation, Against the whole but naked State; Who in his own light Scale makes up with Arms the Weight. 2 Who of his Nation loves to be the first, Tho at the rate of being worst: Who wou'd be rather a great Monster, than A well-proportion'd Man: The Son of Earth with hundred Hands Upon his three-pil'd Mountain stands, Till Thunder strikes him from the Sky; The Son of Earth again in his Earth's Womb does lie. 3 What Blood, Confusion, Ruin to obtain A short and miserable Reign? In what oblique and humble creeping wise Does the mischievous Serpent rise? But ev'n his forked Tongue strikes dead, When he has rear'd up his wicked Head: He murders with his mortal Frown, A Basilisk he grows, if once he gets a Crown. 4 But no Guards can oppose assaulting Ears, Or undermining Tears: No more than Doors, or close-drawn Curtains keep The swarming Dreams out when we sleep. That bloody Conscience too of his, (For O! a Rebel-Redcoat 'tis) Does here his early Hell begin: He sees his Slaves without, his Tyrant feels within. 5 Let gracious God, let never more thy Hand Lift up this Rod against our Land: A Tyrant is a Rod and Serpent too, And brings worse Plagues than Egypt knew. What Rivers stain'd with Blood have been? What Storm and Hailshot have we seen? What Sores deform'd th'ulcerous State? What Darkness to be felt has bury'd us of late? 6 How has it snatch'd our Flocks and Herds away, And even made our Sons a Prey? What croaking Sects and Vermin has it sent The restless Nation to torment? What greedy Troops, what armed Pow'r Of Flies and Locusts, to devour The Land, which ev'ry where they fill? Nor fly they, Lord, away: no, they devour it still. 7 Come th'eleventh Plague rather than this should be: Come sink us rather in the Sea: Come rather Pestilence, and reap us down; Come God's Sword rather than our own: Let rather Roman come again, Or Saxon, Norman, or the Dane: In all the Bonds we ever bore, We griev'd, we sigh'd, we wept; we never blush'd before. 8 If by our Sins the Divine Justice be Call'd to this last Extremity, Let some denouncing Jonas first be sent, To try if England can repent. Methinks, at least, some Prodigy, Some dreadful Comet from on high, Should terribly forewarn the Earth, As of good Princes Deaths, so of a Tyrant's Birth. A Dialogue between two Zealots, upon the Et cætera in the Oath. Sir Roger, from a zealous Piece of Freeze, Rais'd to a Vicaridg of the Childrens Threes; Whose yearly Audit may by strict account To twenty Nobles, and his Vails amount: Fed on the Common of the Female Charity, Until the Scots can bring about their Parity; So shotten, that his Soul, like to himself, Walks but in Querpo: This same Clergy Elf, Encountring with a Brother of the Cloth, Fell presently to cudgels with the Oath. The Quarrel was a strange mishapen Monster, Et cætera (God bless us) which they conster The Brand upon the Buttock of the Beast; The Dragon's Tail ty'd to a Knot; a Nest Of young Apocrypha's; the Fashion Of a new mental Reservation. While Roger thus divides the Text, the other Winks and expounds; saying, My Pious Brother, Hearken with Rev'rence; for the Point is nice, I never read on't, but I fasted twice: And so by Revelation know it better, Than all the learn'd Idolaters o'th' Letter. With that he swell'd, and fell upon the Theme, Like great Goliah, with his Weaver's Beam. I say to thee, Et cætera, thou ly'st, Thou ar't the curled Lock of Antichrist. Rubbish of Babel! for who will not say, Tongues are confounded in Et cætera? Who swears &amp;c. swears more Oaths at once Than Cerberus out of his triple Sconce. Who views it well, with the same Eye beholds The old false Serpent in his Num'rous Folds. Accurst Et cætera! Now, now I scent What the prodigious bloody Oysters meant. O Becker! Beckeer! How cam'st thou to lack This Friend in thy prophetick Almanack? 'Tis the dark Vault wherein the Infernal Plot Of Powder 'gainst the State was first begot. Peruse the Oath, and you shall soon descry it, By all the Father Garnets that stand by it. 'Gainst whom the Church (whereof I am a Member) Shall keep another fifth Day of November. Yet here's not all: I cannot half untruss Et cætera, 'tis so abdominous. The Trojan Nag was not so fully lin'd: Unrip Et cætera, and you shall find Og the great Commissary, and (what's yet worse) Th'Apparitor upon his skew-bald Horse. Then, finally, my Babes of Grace, forbear; Et cætera will be too far to swear: For 'tis (to speak in a familiar stile) A Yorkshire Weabit, longer than a Mile. Here Roger was inspir'd, and by God's-Diggers, He'd swear in Words at length, and not in Figures. Now by this Drink, which he takes off, as loth To leave Et cætera in his liquid Oath, His Brother pledg'd him, and that bloody Wine, He swears, shall seal the Synod's Catiline. So they drunk on, not offering to part, Till they had sworn out the eleventh Quart. While all that saw and heard them, jointly pray, They and their Tribe were all Et cætera. Smectymnuus, or the Club-Divines. Smectymnuus! the Goblin makes me start: I'th'name of Rabbi Abraham, what art? Some Conjuror translate, and let me know it, Till then 'tis fit for a West-Saxon Poet. But do the Brotherhood thus play their Prizes, Like Mummers in Religion, with Disguises? Out-brave us with a Name in Rank and File? A Name, which if 'twere train'd wou'd spread a Mile. The Saints Monopoly, the Zealots Cluster; Which like a Porcupine presents a Muster, And shoots his Quills at Bishops and their Sees; A devout Litter of young Maccabees. Thus Jack of all Trades has distinctly shown The twelve Apostles in a Cherry-stone. Next Sturbridg-Fair is Smec's; for lo! his Side Into a five-fold Lazar's multiply'd. Under each Arm there's tack'd another Gizard, Five Faces lurk under one single Vizard. The Whore of Babylon left these Brats behind, Heirs of Confusion by Gavelkind. Like a Scots Mark, where the more modest Sense Checks the loud Praise, and shrinks to 13 Pence; Like to an Ignis Fatuus, whose Flame, Tho sometimes Tripartite, joins in the same: Like to nine Taylors, who, if rightly spell'd, Into one Man are monosyllabled: Short-handed Zeal in one hath cramped many, Like to the Decalogue in a single Penny. The Sadducees would raise a Question, Who shall be Smec at the Resurrection? Who coop'd them up together, were to blame; Had they but wire-drawn and spun out the Name, 'Twould make another Prentices Petition, Against the Bishops and their Superstition. Some Welshman was his Godfather; for he Wears in his Name his Genealogy. The Banes are ask'd, would but the Times give way, Between Smectymnuus and Et cætera: The Guests, invited by a friendly Summons, Should be the Convocation and the Commons: The Priest to tie the Foxes Tails together, Mosely, or Sancta Clara, chuse you whether. Thus might Religions caterwaul, and Spight, Which uses to divorce, might once unite: But their cross Fortunes interdict their Trade, The Groom is rampant, but the Bride is spay'd. I could by Letters now untwist the Rabble, Whip Smec from Constable to Constable; But there I leave you to another dressing, Only kneel down, and take your Father's Blessing: May the Queen-Mother justify your Fears, And stretch her Patent to your Leathern Ears. Epitaph on the Earl of Strafford. Here lies Wise and Valiant Dust, Huddled up 'twixt Fit and Just: Strafford, who was hurry'd hence, 'Twixt Treason and Convenience. He spent his Time here in a Mist, A Papist, yet a Calvinist. His Prince's nearest Joy and Grief He had, yet wanted all Relief. The Prop and Ruin of the State, The Peoples violent Love and Hate. One in Extremes lov'd and abhorr'd: Riddles lie here, and in a word, Here lies Blood, and let it lie Speechless still, and never cry. On the Death of K. Charles the First. Great! Good! and Just! Could I but rate My Griefs, and thy too rigid Fate, I'd weep the World to such a Strain, As it should deluge once again. But since thy loud-tongu'd Blood demands Supplies, More from Briareus' Hands than Argus' Eyes, I'll sing thy Obsequies with Trumpet-Sounds, And write thy Epitaph with Blood and Wounds. MONTROSE. Written with the Point of his Sword. A Lenten Litany. From Villany dress'd in a Doublet of Zeal, From three Kingdoms bak'd in one Commonweal, From a Gleek of Lord Keepers of one poor Seal, Libera nos Domine.

The rising Sun complies with our weak Sight, First gilds the Clouds, then shews his Globe of Light, At such a distance from our Eyes, as tho He knew what harm his hasty Beams would do: But your full Majesty at once breaks forth In the Meridian of your Reign; your Worth, Your Youth, and all the Splendour of your State Wrapt up, till now, in adverse Clouds of Fate, With such a Flood of Light invade our Eyes, And our spread Hearts with so great Joy surprize; That if your Grace incline that we should live, You must not, SIR, too hastily forgive. Our Guilt preserves us from th'Excess of Joy, Which scatters Spirits, or would else destroy. All are obnoxious, and this faulty Land, Like fainting Hester, does before you stand, Watching your Scepter; the revolted Sea Trembles to think she did your Foes obey. Great Britain, like blind Polypheme, of late, In a wild Rage became the Scorn and Hate Of her proud Neighbours, who began to think, She with the Weight of her own Force would sink. But you are come, and all their Hopes are vain, This Giant Isle has got her Eye again. Now she might spare the Ocean, and oppose Your Conduct to the fiercest of her Foes. Naked, the Graces guarded you from all Dangers abroad, and now your Thunder shall. Princes, that saw you, diff'rent Passions prove, For now they dread the Object of their Love; Nor without Envy can behold his Height, Whose Conversation was their late Delight. So Semele contented with the Rape Of Jupiter, disguis'd in mortal Shape, When she beheld his Hands with Lightning fill'd, And his bright Rays, was with Amazement kill'd. And tho it be our Sorrow and our Crime, To have accepted Life so long a time Without you here, yet does this Absence gain No small Advantage to your present Reign: For having view'd the Persons and the Things, The Councils, State, and Strength of Europe's Kings, You know your Work, Ambition to restrain, And set them Bounds, as Heav'n does to the Main. We have you now with ruling Wisdom fraught, Not such as Books, but such as Practice taught: So the lost Sun, while least by us enjoy'd, Is the whole Night for our Concern imploy'd: He ripens Spices, Fruits, and precious Gums; Which from remotest Regions hither come. This Seat of yours, from th'other World remov'd, Had Archimedes known, he might have prov'd His Engine's Force; fix'd here, your Power and Skill Make the World's Motion wait upon your Will. Much suff'ring Monarch, the first English born, That has the Crown of these three Nations worn; How has your Patience, with the barbarous Rage Of your own Soil, contended half an Age? Till (your try'd Vertue, and your sacred Word, At last preventing your unwilling Sword) Armies and Fleets, which kept you out so long, Own'd their Great Sov'reign, and redress'd his Wrong. When strait the People, by no Force compell'd, Nor longer from their Inclination held, Break forth at once, like Pouder set on fire, And with a noble Rage their King require. So th'injur'd Sea, which from her wonted Course To gain some Acres, Avarice did force; If the new Banks, neglected once, decay, No longer will from her old Channel stay: Raging, the late-got Land she overflows, And all that's built upon't to Ruin grows. Offenders now, the chiefest, do begin To strive for Grace, and expiate their Sin. All Winds blow fair that did the World imbroil, Your Vipers Treacle yield, and Scorpions Oil. If then such Praise the Macedonian got, For having rudely cut the Gordian Knot; What Glory's due to him, that could divide Such ravel'd Int'rests, has the Knot unty'd, And without Stroke so smooth a Passage made, Where Craft and Malice such Impeachments laid? But while we praise you, you ascribe it all To his high Hand, which threw the untouch'd Wall Of self-demolish'd Jericho so low: His Angel 'twas that did before you go; Tam'd savage Hearts, and made Affections yield, Like Ears of Corn when Wind salutes the Field. Thus Patience crown'd, like Job's, your Trouble ends, Having your Foes to pardon, and your Friends: For tho your Courage were so firm a Rock, What private Vertue could endure the shock? Like your great Master, you the Storm withstood, And pity'd those who Love with Frailty shew'd. Rude Indians, torturing all the Royal Race, Him with the Throne and dear-bought Scepter grace, That suffers best; what Region could be found, Where your Heroick Head had not been crown'd? The next Experience of your mighty Mind, Is how you combat Fortune, now she's kind: And this way too you are victorious found, She flatters with the same Success she frown'd. While to your self severe, to others kind, With Power unbounded, and a Will confin'd, Of this vast Empire you possess the Care, The softer part falls to the Peoples Share: Safety and equal Government are things Which make the Subjects happy as their Kings. Faith, Law and Piety, that banish'd Train, Justice and Truth with you return again. The Cities Trade, and Countries easy Life Once more shall flourish without Fraud or Strife: Your Reign no less assures the Ploughman's Peace, Than the warm Sun advances his Increase; And does the Shepherds as securely keep From all their Fears, as they preserve their Sheep. But above all, the Muse-inspired Train Triumph, and raise their drooping Heads again: Kind Heav'n at once has in your Person sent Their sacred Judg, their Guard, and Argument. Satire on the Scots. Come keen Iambicks with your Badgers Feet, And Badger-like, bite till your Teeth do meet; Help, ye tart Satirists, to imp my Rage With all the Scorpions that should whip this Age. But that there's Charm in Verse, I would not quote The Name of Scot without an Antidote; Unless my Head were red, that I might brew Invention there that might be Poison too. Were I a drouzy Judg, whose dismal Note Disgorges Halters as a Juggler's Throat Does Ribbons: Could I in Sir Empirick's Tone Speak Pills in Phrase, and quack Destruction; Or roar like Marshal, that Geneva Bull, Hell and Damnation, a Pulpit full: Yet to express a Scot, to play that Prize, Not all those Mouth-Granadoes can suffice: Before a Scot can properly be curst, I must, like Hocus, swallow Daggers first. Scots are like Witches; do but whet your Pen, Scratch till the Blood comes, they'll not hurt you then. Now as the Martyrs were compell'd to take The Shapes of Beasts, like Hypocrites at stake: I'll bait my Scot so, yet not cheat your Eyes; A Scot within a Beast is no Disguise. No more let Ireland brag, her harmless Nation Fosters no Venom since that Scot's Plantation, Nor can our feign'd Antiquity obtain Since they came in, England has Wolves again. Nature herself does Scotch-men Beasts confess, Making their Country such a Wilderness; A Land that brings in question and suspence God's Omnipresence, but that Charles came thence: But that Montrose and Crawford's Royal Band, Aton'd their Sin, and christen'd half the Land. Nor is it all the Nation has these Spots, There is a Church as well as Kirk of Scots: As in a Picture, where the squinting Paint Shews Fiend on this side, and on that side Saint. He that saw Hell in's melancholy Dream, And in the Twilight of his Fancy's Theme, Scar'd from his Sins, repented in a Fright, Had he view'd Scotland, had turn'd Proselyte. A Land where one may pray with curst Intent, O may they never suffer Banishment! Had Cain been Scot, God would have chang'd his Doom, Not forc'd him wander, but confin'd him home. Like Jews they spread, and as Infection fly, As if the Devil had Ubiquity. Hence 'tis they live at Rovers, and defy This or that Place, Rags of Geography. They're Citizens o'th' World, they're all in all, Scotland's a Nation Epidemical. And yet they ramble not to learn the Mode, How to be drest, or how to lisp abroad; To return knowing in the Spanish Shrug, Or which of the Dutch States a double Jug Resembles most in Belly, or in Beard, (The Card by which the Mariners are steer'd) No! the Scots-Errant fight, and fight to eat, Their Ostrich Stomachs make their Swords their Meat. Nature with Scots, as Tooth-drawers, has dealt, Who use to string their Teeth upon their Belt. Not Gold, nor Acts of Grace, 'tis Steel must tame The stubborn Scot: a Prince that would reclaim Rebels by yielding, does like him, or worse, Who saddled his own Back to shame his Horse. Was it for this you left your leaner Soil, Thus to lard Israel with Egypt's Spoil? Lord! what a goodly thing is want of Shirts? How a Scotch Stomach, and no Meat converts! They wanted Food and Raiment, so they took Religion for their Semstress and their Cook. Unmask them well, their Honours, and Estate, As well as Conscience, are sophisticate. Shrive but their Titles, and their Monies poise; A Laird and twenty Pence pronounc'd with Noise, When constru'd, but for a plain Yeoman go, And a good sober Two-pence, and well so. Hence then you proud Impostors, get you gone, You Picts in Gentry and Devotion; You Scandal to the Stock of Verse, a Race Able to bring the Gibbet in Disgrace. Hyperbolus by suffering did traduce The Ostracism, and sham'd it out of use. The Indian, that Heaven did forswear, Because he heard some Spaniards were there; Had he but known what Scots in Hell had been, He would, Erasmus-like, have hung between. My Muse has done. A Voyder for the Nonce, I wrong the Devil, should I pick the Bones: That Dish is his; for when the Scots decease, Hell, like their Nation, feeds on Barnacles. A Scot, when from the Gallows-Tree got loose, Drops into Styx, and turns a Solan Goose. Satire upon the Dutch. Written by Mr. Dryden in the Year 1662. As needy Gallants in the Scrivener's Hands, Court the rich Knaves that gripe their mortgag'd Lands, The first fat Buck of all the Season's sent, And Keeper takes no Fee in Compliment: The Dotage of some Englishmen is such, To fawn on those who ruin them, the Dutch. They shall have all rather than make a War With those, who of the same Religion are. The Straits, the Guinea Trade, the Herrings too; Nay, to keep Friendship, they shall pickle you. Some are resolv'd not to find out the Cheat, But, Cuckold-like, love them that do the Feat. What Injuries soe'er upon us fall, Yet still the same Religion answers all: Religion wheedled us to Civil War, Drew English Blood, and Dutchmens now would spare. Be gull'd no longer; for you'll find it true, They have no more Religion, Faith,—than you: Int'rest's the God they worship in their State, And we, I take it, have not much of that. Well Monarchies may own Religion's Name, But States are Atheists in their very Frame: They share a Sin; and such Proportions fall, That, like a Stink, 'tis nothing to them all. Think on their Rapine, Falshood, Cruelty, And that what once they were, they still would be. To one well-born th'Affront is worse and more, When he's abus'd and baffled by a Boor. With an ill Grace the Dutch their Mischiefs do; They've both ill Nature, and ill Manners too. Well may they boast themselves an antient Nation; For they were bred e'er Manners were in fashion. And their new Commonwealth has set 'em free Only from Honour and Civility. Venetians do not more uncoothly ride, Than did their Lubber-State Mankind bestride: Their Sway became 'em with as ill a Mien, As their own Paunches swell above their Chin. Yet is their Empire no true Growth, but Humour, And only two Kings Touch can cure the Tumour. As Cato did his Africk Fruits display; Let us before our Eyes their Indies lay: All Loyal English will like him conclude; Let Cæsar live, and Carthage be subdu'd. Vox &amp; Lachrymæ Anglorum. Or, The true English-man's Complaint, humbly offer'd to the serious Consideration of their Representatives in Parliament at their next sitting in the Year 1667. To the Parliament. These Lines had kiss'd your Hands October last, But were suspended till the time was past; Because we hop'd you were about to do That which this just Complaint excites you to. It is our Duty to put you in mind Of that great Work which yet does lag behind. Our Griefs and Woes compel us loud to cry, And call on you for speedy Remedy. This was the moving Cause of these our Tears, That you might know our Suff'rings and our Fears. And Providence now having led the Way To give it Birth, peruse it well we pray, And do not take it for an old Wives Story: Behold the Nations Grievances before ye In these short Hints; yet here, as in a Map, With ease you'll see the Cause of our Mishap. There's not a free-born English Protestant But sets both Hand and Heart to this Complaint. Vox &amp; Lachrymæ Anglorum. O patriots renown'd, open your Eyes, And lend an Ear to the Justice of our Cries; As you are Englishmen, our Blood and Bones, Know 'tis your Duty to regard our Groans: On you, next God, our Confidence relies, You are the Bulwarks of our Liberties. Within your Walls was voted in our King, For Joy whereof our Shouts made England ring; And to make him a great and glorious Prince, Both you and we have been at great Expence. Full five and twenty hundred thousand Pound, By you enacted, since has been paid down. Our Customs to a vast Revenue come, Our Fishing-mony no inferiour Sum. The old Ale-spoiling Tax of the Excise Does yearly to a Mass of Mony rise; Besides the Additional of the Royal Aid, And Chimny-Mony, which is yearly paid. Oft have our Heads by Polls been sadly shorn, And from poor Servants Wages Mony's torn: Our Dunkirk yielded many a thousand Pound, ('Tis easier far to fell than gain a Town) With forc'd Benevolence, and other things, Enough t'enrich a dozen Danish Kings. Million on Million on the Nation's back: Yet we and all our Freedoms go to rack. We hop'd when first these heavy Taxes rose, Some shou'd be us'd to scare away our Foes, Or beat them, till, like Gibeonites, they bring Their Grandees ready halter'd to our King; Or make them buckle, and their Points untruss, As they who took for Motto, God with us. But O! instead of this, our cruel Fate Has made us like a Widow desolate. Our Houses sadly burnt about our Ears, Our Wives and Children sensless made with Fears. Our Wares, like Ships, in which our Safety lay, Unto our daring Foes are made a prey: Our Forts and Castles, which shou'd guard our Land, Just like old Nunneries and Abbies stand. And long before our inland Towns demur'd, That Sea and Land alike might be secur'd. Our Magazines which did abound with Store, Like us, sad Englishmen, are very poor. Our Trade is lost, our Markets are undone; Yeomen and Farmers all to ruin run: Those that our fatal Battels fought neglected, And swearing damme cowardly Rogues protected. Our gallant Seamen, once the whole World's Dread, For want of Pay are metamorphosed: While the sad Widows, and poor Orphans weep, Whose dear Relations perish'd in the Deep; And to augment and aggravate their Grief, At the Pay-Office find but cold Relief: Many a Month are forc'd to wait and stay To seek the Price of Blood, dead Husbands Pay. The sober People who our Trade advanc'd, Throughout our Nation are discountenanc'd. It grieves our Hearts, that we shou'd live to see True Virtue punish'd, and foul Vice go free. Thousands alas! that would not hurt a Worm, Imprison'd are, 'cause they could not conform. Others exil'd, and from Relations sent, We know not why, but that they're innocent. While Rome's Black Locusts menace us with Storms, Like Egypt's Frogs about our Land in Swarms. Our Penal Laws are never executed Against those Vermin, which our Land polluted. Only to blind and hoodwink us, alas! An Edict passes to prohibit Mass: With such a Latitude, as most Men say, 'Tis like its Sire, the Oath Et cætera. But prais'd be God for Peace! that's very clear; But on what Terms, th'Event will make appear. We dread lest it should prove more to our Cost, Than when Amboyna's Spicery was lost. They treat with Rod in hand our Buttocks bare, Judg what the Issues of such Treaties are. Thus sick, ye Worthies, sick our Nation lies, And none but God can cure her Maladies. Those that shou'd chear her in your Interval, Like dull Quacksalvers, make her Spirits fail. Turn she her wither'd Face to whom she will, All that she get's is but a purging Pill. If any of her Children for her cry, Her cruel Empiricks use Phlebotomy: That wholesom Physick that should cleanse her Blood, They do detain, inflaming what is good. This for a long time has bad Humours bred; Which send up filthy Vapours to the Head. All wise Men judg, if these Extremes endure, They'll issue in a mad-brain'd Calenture. Then O ye Worthies! now for Heaven's sake, Some Pity on your gasping Country take. Call to account those Leeches of the State, Who from their Trust deeply prevaricate: Who have of English Coin exhausted more Than would ten Cœur de Lions home restore: Who like perfidious and deceitful Elves, Ruin the Nation to enrich themselves: More ready are our Counsels to disclose, Than to protect us from our Belgian Foes. The Fleet divided shews such Treachery, That Pagans, Turks and Infidels decry. The States Purse cannot but be indigent, When so much Mony over-Sea is sent. No wonder Dutchmen cry, Thank Clarend— That we're so roundly paid with English Coin. If George's Mouth be stopt, think they that we Have all our Eyes bor'd out, and cannot see. Our Foes of English Coin have greater Store, Since War's begun, than e'er they had before. Quaint-Stratagem! for Rulers busy'd be, To tie a raw Hyde to an Orange tree; With Resolution, cause he's of that Blood, That lifts his Head above the Mogenhood. Then both the Keipe-Skins would be well bestow'd, One honour'd here, t'other as much abroad. These and like Projects have procur'd a War, Where Mortals worry'd were like Dog and Bear. Then Mony works the Wonder, that is sure, The Price of Dunkirk here may much procure. Dunkirk was sold, but why we do not know, Unless t'erect a new Seraglio: Or be a Receptacle unto those, Were once intended our invading Foes. Then let that treacherous abject Lump of Pride, With all his joint Confederates beside, Be brought to Justice, try'd by our good Laws, And so receive the Merits of their Cause; Who justly now are made the People's Hate, That would not do them Justice in the Gate. We pray your Honours chuse out a Committee, To find the Instruments that burnt our City: Can one poor sensless Frenchman's Life repair The Loss of Britain's great Imperial Chair? Many there were in that vile Fact detected, And those that should them punish, them protected. When Nero did the like on famous Rome, Were all her Senators and People dumb? Must we be silent, when encompass'd round With black-mouth'd Dogs, that would us all confound? Most hellish Plot! 'Twas Guido Faux in grain, Hatch'd by the Jesuits in France and Spain: For which your Honours wisely did remember To keep another Fifth Day of November. When these Delinquents up and down the Nation You sifted for, then came your Prorogation. Mean while tho London in her Ashes lies, Yet out of her shall such a Phœnix rise, Shall be a Scourge and Terror unto those, Who for this hundred Years have been her Foes. Perfidious Papists! Shall your Treachery, Think ye, reduce us to Idolatry? Blood-thirsty Monsters! we know better things, Not all the pride of your black-Lanthorn Kings; Nor all your Counsels of Achitophel, Shall make us run your ready Road to Hell. Blind Blockheads! we abhor your rotten Whore, None but the God of Jacob we adore. We beg your Honours to redeem our Trade, Which in your Intervals is much decay'd: Regaining that, we hope such Fruit 'twill yield, We on our Ruins chearfully may build. We pray, repeal the Laws unnatural, That Men in question for their Conscience call: 'Tis Cruelty for you to force Men to The thing, that they had rather die than do. This is Man's All; 'tis Christ's Prerogative, Therefore against it 'tis in vain to strive. Distribute Justice with an equal Hand, Both to the Peer and Peasant of the Land. Many true Commoner murder'd of late, Yet Justice strikes not the Assassinate. Why should the rightful Cause of Clients be Utterly lost, for want of double Fee? Why partial Judges on the Benches sit? Why Juries overaw'd? This is not fit. Why some corrupted, others wanting Wit? And why a Parliament should suffer it? Why great mens Will should be their only Law? And why they do not call to mind Jack Straw? Why they do let their Reputation rot? And why Carnarvan Edward is forgot? Why Bloodworth would not let the dreadful Fire Extinguish'd be, as good Men did desire? And why Life-Guardmen at each Gate were set, Hindring the People thence their Goods to get? Why were our Houses level'd with the Ground, That fairly stood about the Tow'r round? When many thousand Families were left Without a House, then we must be bereft Of Habitations too, with all the rest, And share with those that greatly were distress'd. Why should our Mother-Queen exhaust our Store, Enriching France, and making England poor? Spending our Treasure in a Foreign Land, Can never with the Nation's Int'rest stand. Then timely stop the bleeding of this Vein, Lest it the Kingdom's vital Spirits drain. Why England now, as in the days of yore, Must have an Intercessor, Madam Shore? Why upon her is spent more in one Day, Than would some Weeks the Publick Charge defray? Why second Rosamond is made away? A thing remains unriddled to this Day. Why Papists put in Places of great Trust, And Protestants lay by their Arms to rust? Why Courtiers rant with Goods of other Men, And why Protections cheat the Citizen? Why drunken Justices are tolerated? And why the Gospel's almost abrogated? Why Clergymen do domineer so high, Who should be Patterns of Humility? Why they do Steeple upon Steeple set, As if they meant that way to Heav'n to get? Who nothing have to prove themselves devout, Save only this, That Cromwel turn'd them out. Why Tippets, Copes, Lawn-sleeves, and such-like Geer, Consume above three Millions by the Year? Why Bell and Dragon Drones, like Boar in Sty, Eat more than all the painful Ministry? Which is one Cause the Nation is so poor: But when will Charles find out their Privy-door? When Daniel shews th'Impression of their Feet, And gives direction, then he'll come to see't. Why England's Grand Religion now should be A stalking Horse to blind Idolatry? Why many thousands now bow down before it, That in their Consciences do much abhor it? Why Treachery is us'd by Complication? Deceit and Fraud, why th'A-la-mode in fashion? Why ranting Cowards in Buff-coats are put, And why they Robbers turn to fill their Gut? Why Fools in Corporations do command, Who know nor Justice, nor the Laws o'th' Land? Why he that brought our Necks into this Yoke, Dreads not the thoughts of Felton's fatal Stroke? Sure they're bewitch'd to think we Englishmen Have no more Courage left us than a Hen. And why that Int'rest is become the least, In the Year Sixty greater than the rest? We know no reason, but do all consent, These are the Fruits of an ill Government. Some think our Judgments do run parallel With David's in the Days of Israel: The difference is, he was a Man of God; But ours have been his sore afflicting Rod, To which we turn our naked Backs, and say, During thy pleasure, Lord, Vive le Roy. We pray, restore our faithful Ministers, Whom we do own as Christ's Embassadors. Why are our Pulpits pester'd with a Crew, That took up Orders since black Barthol'mew? Who Myst'ries of the Gospel know no more, Than the dumb Calf that Israel did adore. Too late for us to you to make our moan, When they have led us to destruction. Must all be Enemies of King and State, That from the Church of England separate? Must all the Meetings of the Innocent Be judg'd unlawful? they to Prison sent? 'Twere better all such Edicts you made void, And grant the Liberty they once enjoy'd; Confirming that unto 'em by a Law, Makes good the Royal Promise at Breda. Tread all Monopolies into the Earth, And make provision that no more get birth. In this a Prince's Danger chiefly lies, That he is forc'd to see with others Eyes. From hence our Troubles rose in Forty One, When that Domestick War at first began. Relieve th'Oppress'd, and set all Pris'ners free, Who for their Consciences in durance be. Poor Debtors, who have not wherewith to pay, Break off their Shackles, let them go their way. Let no suborn'd false Witnesses appear In Courts, against the Innocent to swear: Let no more Juries, that are biassed, Be pack'd to do whatever they are bid: Who to fulfil mens Lust and Cruelty, Have no regard altho the Guiltless die. Why should our righteous Laws like Cobwebs be, To catch small Flies, and let the great go free? This turns true Judgment into Wormwood-gall, Does for the Vengeance of th'Avenger call; Then ease those Burdens under which we groan, Give Liberty its Resurrection. Let painful Husbandry, that Child of Peace, Be now encourag'd since our Wars do cease. Let not the poor and inslav'd Peasant crave Redress from you, and yet no Succour have. 'Tis too much like a base French Stratagem, To make the People poor to govern them: More happy for a Prince, when Aid he craves, To have't from free-born Men, than injur'd Slaves. We are free-born, we yet are English Men: Let's not, like old Men, boast what we have been; But make us happy by your gentle Rays, And you shall be the Tenour of our Praise: And our Posterity, with joint Consent, Shall call you England's Healing Parliament. But if you still will make our Bonds the stronger, If Pris'ners must remain in Durance longer; If wand'ring Stars must still by Force detrude, Under Eclipse, those of first Magnitude; If Prelates still must o'er our Conscience ride, And Papists Bonfires make of us beside: If he and they, whose Avarice and Pride So long have rid our Backs, and gaul'd our Side; Have got so strong an Int'rest in the State, That their Commitment costs so long Debate, Till means be found to further their Escape To Foreign Parts, there to negotiate; The Edg of Justice surely's turn'd aside, To cut the poor Man's Flesh, and save the Hyde. If you mens Lusts and Avarice gratify, And yet our empty'd Purse-strings do unty; You are too free of what was ne'er your own, And now you only make us more to groan, Ass-like: and surely any mortal Man Will seek to ease his Burden if he can. There's not an Englishman but well has learn'd, Your Privileges are alike concern'd With all our Liberties; that he who doth Infringe the one, usurps upon 'em both. And shall it on your Doors and Tombs be writ, This was the Parliament so long did sit; While Conscience, Liberty, our Purse and Trade, The Country, City, Ships, and all's betray'd? To make an Act for building on the Urn, But no Inquest who did the City burn: To feed a Palmer-worm, who threw away The Publick Stock, which Seamen should defray. Since now you have an Opportunity, Redeem your selves and us from Slavery: If not, the Wheel goes round, there is no doubt, You'l also share with those you have turn'd out. Vivat Lex Rex. POSTSCRIPT. If e'er you'l leave us in a lasting Peace, You all our Grievances must first redress. When Rulers stop their Ears to th'Peoples Cries, 'Tis a sad Symptom of Catastrophies. In Watch or Clock things made irregular, Tho ne'er so small, cause all the Work to jar, And in the Body natural 'tis found, That if ill Humours do therein abound, Them the Physician must extenuate, And make 'em with the rest co-operate: So if in Bodies politick there be Not found, 'twixt all Estates, a Harmony; They cease not till, in tract of Time, they bring All to confusion, Peasant, Lord, and King. To make some great, and ruin all the rest, In this a Commonwealth can ne'er be blest. And does it follow hence, Great Sir, that we Must be undone to all Posterity? Let Equity and Justice plead our Cause, And then refer us to our Antient Laws. If Magna Charta must be wholly slighted, We must conclude our Rulers are benighted. But needs must we be poor, when it is known We've had a second Price of Gavestone. Your Pow'r is Sov'reign, else we durst not quote This poys'nous Name without an Antidote. Perfidious Clarend—! that Potent Thief, His Prince's Blemish, and the People's Grief; Who once did scorn to plunder by Retail, Who stretch'd the States Purse till the Strings did fail: He and his Fellow-Jugglers found the knack To plough deep Furrows on the Nation's Back. Like Glaziers, who excite the roaring Crew, Windows to break, that they may make them new: So these pick Quarrels with our Neighbour Nations, Then baul at you to peel us with Taxations; Which having got, still more and more they crave, Ev'n like the Horse-leech, or devouring Grave: For Avarice cannot be satisfy'd, No more than Belzebub, and's Brother H?. That Macchiavel we have not yet forgot, Who brew'd that wicked Hellish Northern Plot; Where many Gentlemen had ruin'd been, If Providence had not step'd in between. Who then among your selves secure can be, If this be not check'd by Authority? He was one of the open-handed Tribe, Whose Avarice ne'er yet refus'd a Bribe. What Suit at Law soe'er before him came, He that produc'd most Angels, won the Game: Be't right or wrong, or Plaintiff or Defendant Should win the day if Gold were at the end on't. How did he send without Remorse or Fear Thousands of English to that Grave, Tangier? What Usage had the Scots, thousands can tell, When the late Remonstrators did rebel. While Irish Rebels quit their old O Hone, Poor English Protestants take up the Tone. Empson's and Dudley's Fact compar'd with his, Were but Night's Darkness unto Hell's Abyss. The famous Spencers did in time pourtray What should be acted by this Beast of Prey. Earth him, and you shall find within his Cell Those Mischiefs which no Age can parallel; War, Fire and Blood, with vast expence of Treasure, Ruin of Englishmen, his chiefest Pleasure. In fine, for Mischief he was what you will, The perfect Epitome of all Ill. All good Men hate his Name; nay, what is worse, Three Nations dog him with their heavy Curse. As he regarded not the Widow's Tears, So may just Heaven multiply his Fears: Let Cain's most dreadful Doom soon overtake him, And his Companion Gout never forsake him: Let Heaven's Vengeance light upon his Pate, And all our Injuries retaliate: Till he himself to Justice does resign, Let all Men call him cursed Clarend—. Most dextrous Artist! he with mighty ease Transplanted Dunkirk from beyond the Seas, And dropt it near that fatal Spot of Land, Where for him Tyburn now does weeping stand. The echoing Ax from out the Tower does call, To speed this Monster Epidemical: But he upon us having play'd his Prank, Follows his Brethren Finch and Wyndebank. Thus Hyde by Name, is Hide by Practice too, Yet cannot hide from Heav'n, tho hid from you: And being gone, has left his Imps behind, Whose only Work is all our Eyes to blind; Lest tracing him you find their Villany, Known yet to few but the all-seeing Eye. If any thing of common Fame be true, He's only gone our Mischiefs to renew: And if his Practice justify our Fears, He'll set's again together by the Ears. Ambition's of the nature of the Devil, Always to brood, and hatch, and bring forth Evil. If true the Maxim be, Kings cannot err; With Modesty we may from thence infer, Ill thrives that hapless Nation then that shows A silent Prince, and Chancellor that crows Over his Equals, over all his Peers, Over Phanaticks, over Cavaliers. He was so absolute, 'twas hard to say, Or him, or Charles, whether we must obey. Ris'n from a Gentleman too near the Throne, Sought not the Nation's Int'rest, but his own. You are the Bridle in such Tyrants Jaws, Who would destroy us, and subvert the Laws. Now hold the Reins, now keep the Ballance true, Find those Banditti that do lie purdieu. If you, like Cato, for your Country stand, Three noble Nations are at your Command: While Justice, Truth and Righteousness do guide you, We'll be your Guard, whatever shall betide you. Disarm the Papists, and secure our Ports, Place Protestants in Garisons and Forts. Why should the French and Irish here bear sway, Who Enemies to England are this day? Let not our Magazines remain with those That burnt our City, and still are our Foes; Whose Hellish bloody Principles are such, To butcher Englishmen they think not much. What Safety, Peace, or Trade can we expect, When these Protection find, and you neglect Us to secure against such Cut-throat Dogs, As swarm now in our Land like Egypt's Frogs? What means the flocking of the French so fast Into our Bowels thus with Arms to haste? And must our Horses, which of Value be, Be thus to France transported, as we see? Are not our Forts and Castles all betray'd, When all their Stores and Guns aside are laid Out of the reach of such as would oppose Both Foreign En'mies and Domestick Foes? Did the dumb Child, when at his Father's Throat He saw a Knife, immediately cry out? Can we be silent when the Train is laid, And Fire-works made ready, as 'tis said? Look thro the Veil, and you will soon espy That Romish Counsels close at work do lie To undermine you, and Religion too: Look well about you, lest you do it rue. Now is the time t'acquit your selves like Men, Now stand up for your Liberties, and then The Laurel Wreath, and never-fading Bays Shall crown your Heads, and we will sing your Praise. Upon the Proroguing of the Parliament; or, The Club of Unanimous Voters. Prorogue upon Prorogue! Damn'd Rogues and Whores! First pick'd our Pockets, then turn'd us out of Doors. Have we our Country plagu'd, and Trust betray'd, Giv'n Polls, and Subsidies, and Royal Aid, Hearth-Mony, Imposts on the Lawyers Fees, Ruin'd all Trades, tormented all Degrees, Crush'd the poor Phanaticks, broke thro all the Laws Of Magna Charta, and the good Old Cause, To be thus fool'd at last? Have we more Bullion giv'n in twelve years space, Than Norman's Bastard had, and all his Race; Hurry'd up our Mony-Bills 'gainst Dutch and French, And seen it spent upon a Dunghil Wench? Did we consent the Kingdom to undo, T'enrich an over-ridden Whore or two, And all for this? With Plague, War, Fire was this poor Kingdom curs'd, While of all Plagues we were our selves the worst. Were just Elections null'd, took we such Pain To make a Parliament-man a Rogue in grain, Stood to be piss'd on by the House of Peers, Cut Coventry's Nose, and cropt his Ears? Unworthy Gentlemen, more like Servants Race, Run to our Master's Collar to Fox our Mace. Did we a hundred baser Acts than these, That we might not his Majesty displease, To be thus serv'd? Well-fare true Vaughan, Osborn, Howard, Carr, Lit?ton, Sey?r, our great Men of War, And Garraway, the Hector of the House, That always fetch'd his Blow to kill a Louse: These Patriots, Male-content, did plot Their Countries Good, till they had Places got; Bluster'd and huff'd till they were officer'd, And then of Country more the De'el a word. Damn'd Buckingham! of a false Sire the Son! Did we for this dismount old Clarendon To set thee up, thou mighty Man of State, And in thy hands put the whole Kingdom's Fate? Did we forget thy former Treachery, When safe, thou left'st our King in Misery? Turn'd sneaking Renegade to what was Trump, And swor'st Allegiance to the rotten Rump? Did we free thee, when Chancellor thee mumbled, And when thou wert by him from Post to Pillar tumbled? Did we connive at taking Shrewsbury's Life, That with more freedom thou might'st have his Wife, To be requited thus? Ungrateful Wretch! May Pox, and Plague, and Devil hence thee fetch! Or some Prorogu'd, incensed Felton rather Send this curs'd Son to find his guilty Father! No other way could'st find t'attain thy Ends, Than to disgust the King with his best Friends? Turn out a Parliament, that ne'er King before Had such a one, nor ever will have more? Did we give cause to fear we should not do Whate'er the King or thou command'st us to? If Standing-Army 'tis thou wouldst be at, We could as well as others have rais'd that. We could have made, as well as any other, A Bastard Race Legitimate as Brother: Consented to send back the barren Queen, And a new Issue had, had that your Humour been. League Tripartite we could have broke, the Dance Chang'd to the Musick of the Pipe of France: Sneer, and look thro the Fingers to behold New London flaming, as you did the old. We freely could have rais'd a Citadel, As well the City as the Dutch to quell: We coul make Plots, as Oliver on Hewit, And make such guilty of 'em as ne'er knew it. And must we after all this Service done, In Field for Father, and in House for Son, Be thus cashier'd to please a pocky Peer, Who neither Roundhead is, nor Cavalier? But of some medley-cut, some ill-shap'd Brat, Would fain be something if he knew but what. For Commonwealth he vogues himself to be, And by and by for Abs'lute Monarchy: Then neither likes; but some new knick-knack found, Not Fish, not Flesh, not square, and yet not round. Venetian Model pleases him to-night, To-morrow Morning France is in the right. Thus he, like Butterflies, much flutter makes; Sleeps of one Judgment, of another wakes. Zealous at Morn, he will a Bishop make, Yet before night all Bishops down he'll take. He all things is, but yet to nothing true; All old things hates, nor can endure the new. But please your pocky Grace to give me leave To ask why thus you do your King deceive? Your first Prorogu'd sure might have stood, for then 'Twas time enough for to Prorogue agen; And not all in a hurry, sev'n Months before Our former not expir'd, to add six more. Nell's in again we hear, tho we are out; Methinks we might have met to have giv'n a Clout, And then Prorogu'd again: our Wont has been Never to miss a Sessions 'gainst Lying-in. For always 'gainst that time the French invade, 'Gainst whom we Mony raise to keep the Jade. And ten to one before the Spring be over, Our Cavalry must march again to Dover, To guard the Shore against the Dutch and French; When all this means but new Supplies for Wench. The curs'd Cabal saw 'twas in vain to move For Dissolution; we had too much Love To be dissolv'd; which put you to find out This damn'd side-wind to bring the end about. For now the sacred Cod-piece must keep Lent, Unless Phanaticks lend, or Mony from France be sent. Had we but hearken'd, and a fair Game play'd, We had prevented thus our being betray'd. For had we Observation made, we might Have known at Morn the Fate we found at Night. For Cæsar never more Presages had Of falling Greatness, than to us were made. Crow cross'd the Speaker's Coach as to the House he came, On Crutches that day went the Cripple lame. The Thames at our Proroguing backward run; Moon shone at Noon-day, and at Night the Sun. A hollow earthly Voice i'th' House was heard, Which made the Speaker of Guy Faux afraid. Owen's Pease-Pottage unkindly boil'd that day; A foul Handkerchief in Pocket had Bab May. That day our Clock too was upon its Tricks, Would not go right; strikes five when 'twas near six. But since there's no resisting of our Fate, We hope we may have leave to invocate. Ah! sweet Revenge! may we but live to see Such Rogues prorogued too as well as we! Indulge our Envy but to see that day, Tho we are ruin'd by it as well as they. We Tyrants love, if we can Tyrants be; If not, next Wish is we may all be Free. A New Ballad, call'd, The Chequer-Inn. 1 I'll tell thee, Dick, where I have been, Where I the Parliament have seen, The Choice of Ale and Beer: But such a Choice as ne'er was found, In any Age on English Ground, In Borough or in Shire. 2 At Charing-Cross, hard by the way Where all the Berties make their Hay, There stands a House new painted: Where I could see 'em crouding in; But sure they often there had been, They seem'd so well acquainted. 3 The Host that dwells in that same House, Is now a Man that was a Mouse, Till he was Burgess chosen: And for his Country first began, But quickly turned Cat in Pan; The way they all have rosen. 4 And ever since he did so wex, That now he Mony tells by Pecks, And heaps up all our Treasure: Thou'lt ken him out by his white Wand He dandles always in his Hand, With which he strikes the Measure. 5 And tho he now does look so big, And bear himself on such a Twig, 'Twill fail him in a Year: Then O! how I could claw him off, For all his slender Quarter-staff, And have him here and there. 6 He is as stiff as any Stake, And leaner, Dick, than any Rake, Envy is not so pale: And tho by selling of us all, He'as wrought himself into Whitehall, He looks like Bird of Jail. 7 And where he might e'er now have laid, Had not the Members most been made, For some had been indicted: For whosoe'er that peach him durst, To clear him would have been the first, Had they too been requited. 8 But he had Men enough to spare, Besides a good Friend in the Chair, Tho all Men blush'd that heard it: Therefore I needs must speak my Mind, They all deserv'd to have been kind For such a shameful Verdict. 9 And now they march'd all Tag and Rag, Each of his handy work to brag, Over a gallant Supper: On backside of their Letter some For sureness cited were to come; The rest were bid by Cooper. 10 They stood, when enter'd in the Hall, Mannerly rear'd against the Wall, Till to sit down desir'd: And simper'd, justly to compare, Like Maidens at a Statue-Fair, None went away unhir'd. 11 The Lady, dress'd like any Bride, Her Forehead-Cloth had laid aside, And smiling thro did sail: Tho they had dirted so the Room, That she was forc'd to call for Groom, To carry up her Tail. 12 Wheeler at Board then next her set, And if it had been nearer yet, She might it well afford: For ev'n at Bed the time has been, When no one could see Sun between His Lady and her Lord. 13 This Knight was sent t'America, And was as soon sent for away, Tho not for his good Deeds: But 'twas, it seems, with this Intent, To plant with us that Government, From thence he brought the Seeds. 14 And next him sat George Mountague, The Foreman of the British Crew, His Cup he never fails: Mansel and Morgan, and the rest, All of them of the Grand Inquest, A Jury right of Wales. 15 Wild with his Tongue did all out-run, And popping like an Elder-Gun, Both Words and Meat did utter: The Pellets which his Chaps did dart, Fed all his Neighbours overthwart, That gap'd to hear him sputter. 16 But King, God save him, tho so cramm'd, The Cheer into his Breeches ramm'd, Which Butt'ry were and Larder: And of more Prov'nder to dispose, Had sew'd on too his double Hose; For Times thou know'st grew harder. 17 H?lt, out of Linen, as of Land, Had mortgag'd of his two one Band, To have the other wash'd: And tho the Sweat, the while he eat, With his own Gravy fill'd the Plate, That Band with Sauce too dash'd. 18 His Brain and Face Tredenham wrung, For Words not to be said but sung; His Neck it turn'd on Wier: And Berkenhead of all the Rout, There was but one could be found out, To be a greater Lyar. 19 Old Hobbes's Brother Cheyney there, Throgmorton, Neville, Doleman were, And Lawley, Knight of Shropshire: Nay, Portman, tho all Men cry'd shame, And Cholm'ley of Vale Royal came For something more than Chop-cheer. 20 The Western Glory, Harry Ford, The Landlord Bailes out-eat, out-roar'd, And did his Trencher lick: What pity 'tis a Wit so great, Should live to sell himself for Meat; But who can help it, Dick? 21 Yet, wot'st thou, he was none of those, But would as well as Meat have Clothes, Before he'd sell the Nation: And wisely lodging at next Door, Was serv'd more often than the Poor, With his whole Generation. 22 Sir Courtney Poole and he contend, Which should the other most commend For what that Day they spoke: The Man that gave that woful Tax, And sweeping all our Chimney-Stacks, Excises us for Smoke. 23 The Hanmers, Herberts, Sandys, Musgr?s, Fathers and Sons, like coupled Slaves, They were not to be sunder'd: The Tale of all that there did sup On Chequer-Tallies, was scor'd up, And made above a hundred. 24 Our greatest Barn could not have held The Belly-Timber that they fell'd, For Mess was rick'd on Mess: 'Twas such a Treat, that I'm afraid The Reck'ning never will be paid, Without another Cess. 25 They talk'd about, and made such din, That scarce the Lady could hedg in The Papishes and Frenches: On them she was allow'd to rail, But, and thereby does hang a Tale, Not one word of the Wenches. 26 The Host, who sat at lower end, The Healths in order up did send, Nor of his own took care: But down the Visick Bottle threw, And took his Wine, when 'twas his Due, In spite of 'Pothecare. 27 They drank, I know not who had most, Till King both Hostess kiss'd and Host, And clap'd 'em on the Back: And prithee why so pale? then swore, Should they indict him o'er and o'er, He'd bring him off i'fack. 28 Then all said Ay, who had said No, And now, who would, 'twas time to go, For Grace they did not stay: And for to save the Serving-Men The Pains of coming in agen, The Guests took all away. 29 Candlesticks, Forks, Salts, Plates, Spoons, Knives, Like Sweet-meats for their Girls and Wives, And Table-Linen went: I saw no more, but hither ran, Lest some should take me for the Man, And I for them be shent. The Answer. 1 Curse on such Representatives, They sell us all, our Barns and Wives, Quoth Dick, with Indignation: They are but Engines to raise Tax, And the whole Bus'ness of their Acts Is to undo the Nation. 2 Just like our rotten Pump at home, We pour in Water when 'twon't come, And that way get more out: So when mine Host does Mony lack, He Mony gives among the Pack, And then it runs full spout. 3 By wise Volk I have oft been told, Parliaments grow naught as they grow old, We groan'd under the Rump: But sure this is a heavier Curse, That sucks and dreins thus ev'ry Purse, By this old Whitehall Pump. On King Charles the First's Statue. Why 'tis so long before 'tis put up at Charing-Cross. 1 What can the Myst'ry be, why Charing-Cross These two Months continues still blinded with Boards? Dear Wheeler impart, we are all at a loss, Unless Punchianello is to be restor'd. 2 'Twere to Scaramouchi too much Disrespect, To limit his Troop to this Theatre small; Besides the Injustice it were to eject That Mimick, so legally seiz'd of Whitehall. 3 For a Dial the Place is too unsecure, Since a Guard and a Garden could not one defend; For so near to the Court they will not endure, Any more to know how their time they mispend. 4 Were these Deals then in store for sheltring our Fleet, When the King in Armada to Portsmouth did sail? Or the Bishops and Treasurer did they agree't, To repair with such Riff-raff the Church's old Pale? 5 Now to comfort the Heart of the old Cavalier, The late King on Horseback is here to be shewn; What ado with the Kings and Statues is here? Have we not had enough already of one? 6 Does the Treas'rer think Men so legally tame, When the Pensions are stopt to be fool'd with a sight? No: 'tis forty to one if he play on his Game, But he'll shortly reduce it to Forty and Eight. 7 The Trojan Courser, tho not of Brass, but of Wood, Had within him an Army that burnt down the Town; However 'tis ominous, if understood, For the old King on Horseback is but half a Crown. 8 But his Brother-in-law's Horse had got much Repute, That the Treasurer thought fit to try it agen; And instead of a Market of Herbs and of Fruit, He will here keep a Market of Parliament-men. 9 But why is the Work so long at a stand? Such things you should never, or suddenly do: As the Parliament twice was prorogu'd to your hand, Will you venture so long to prorogue the King too? 10 Let us have a King, be he new, be he old, Not Vyner delay'd us so, tho he was broken: Tho the King be of Copper, and Danby of Gold, Shall the Treas'rer of Guineas grudg us such a Token? 11 The Houswifely Treasuress sure's grown very wise, Who so lib'rally treated the Members at Supper; She thinks not convenient to go to the Price, That we lose both our King, our Horse, and our Crupper. 12 When for so many Parties we are to provide, To buy a King is not so wise as to sell; But however, she said, it can't be deny'd, But a Monarch of Gingerbread will do as well. 13 The Treasurer told her, he thought she was mad, And his Parliament-Roll withal did produce; Where he shew'd her that so many Votes he then had, As would the next Sessions reimburse him with Use. 14 So the Statue will up after all this delay; But to turn the Face tow'rds Whitehall you must shun: Tho of Brass, yet for Grief, it will melt soon away, To behold ev'ry Day such a Court, such a Son. A Ballad, call'd, The Hay-market Hectors. The attribution of this poem is questionable. 1 I sing a woful Ditty, Of a Wound that long will smart-a; Giv'n, the more's the pity, In the Realm of Magna Charta. Youth, Youth, thou'dst better been slain by thy Foes, Than live to be hang'd for cutting a Nose. 2 Our good King C? the Second, Too flippant of Treasure and Moisture, Stoop'd from the Queen infecund, To a Wench of Orange and Oyster. Consulting his Catzo, he found it expedient To engender Don Johns on Nell the Comedian. 3 The leach'rous Vain-glory Of being lim'd with Majesty, Mounts up to such a Story This Bitchington Travesty; That to equal her Lover, the Baggage must dare To be Helen the Second, and Cause of a War. 4 And he our am'rous Jove, While she lay dry-bobb'd under, To repair the Defect of his Love, Must lend her his Lightning and Thunder. And for one Night prostitutes to her Commands, His Monmouth, Life-Guards, O-Brian and Sands. 5 And now all fear of the French, And the pressing need of Navy, Are dwindled into a salt Wench, And Amo, Amas, Amavi. Now he'll venture his Subsidy so he cloven may see, In Female Revenge, the Nose of Coventry. 6 O ye Hay-market Hectors, How came you thus charm'd, To be the Dissectors Of one poor Nose unarm'd? Unfit to wear Sword, or follow a Trumpet, That would brandish your Knives at the word of a Strumpet. 7 But was't not ungrateful, In Monmouth, Ap-Sidney, Ap-Carlo, To contrive an Act so hateful, O Prince of Wales, by Barlow? For since the kind World had dispens'd with his Mother, Might he not well have spar'd the Nose of John Brother? 8 Beware all ye Parliamenteers, How each of his Voice disposes: Bab May in the Commons, C. Rex in the Peers, Sit telling your Fates on your Noses; And decree, at the mention of every Slut, Whose Nose shall continue, and whose shall be cut. 9 If the Sister of Rose, Be a Whore so anointed; That the Parliament's Nose Must for her be disjointed? Then should you but name the Prerogative Whore, How the Bullets would whistle, the Cannons would roar! A new Ballad, to an old Tune, call'd, I am the Duke of Norfolk, &amp;c. The attribution of this poem is questionable. 1 I am a sensless thing, with a Hey, with a Hey, Men call me a King, with a Ho: To my Luxury and Ease, They brought me o'er the Seas, With a Hey Tronny Nonny Nonny no. 2 I melt away their Treasure, with a Hey, &amp;c. And swive at my Pleasure, with a Ho: Their Women, and their Coin, Are now become all mine, With a Hey Tronny, &amp;c. 3 With a Court, and a Stage, with a Hey, &amp;c. I corrupted the Age, with a Ho: The Nation once were Men, But now are Slaves agen, With a Hey Tronny, &amp;c. 4 Let the Bankers break, with a Hey, &amp;c. And the City sneak, with a Ho: I've got a pack of Knaves, Who will ride the dull Slaves, With a Hey Tronny, &amp;c. 5 Let the Commons search for Plots, with a Hey, &amp;c. And the Lords sit like Sots, with a Ho: If my Brother and my Whore Say the word, they're no more, With a Hey Tronny, &amp;c. 6 They pull'd my Army down, with a Hey, &amp;c. And so they would my Crown, with a Ho: But to prevent that Chance, I've sold it all to France, With a Hey Tronny, &amp;c. 7 And while they all give ear, with a Hey, &amp;c. To what Oats and Bedlowe swear, with a Ho: With Mirth I burst my Gall, To see the Rascals sham 'em all, With a Hey Tronny, &amp;c. 8 'Twas a Blast of Royal Breath, with a Hey, &amp;c. Gave Godfrey his Death, with a Ho: 'Twas contriv'd by the Elf, My Brother, and my self, With a Tronny, &amp;c. 9 My Ministers of State, with a Hey, &amp;c. Whom I damn to make 'em great, with a Ho Let them use their wisest Skill, I'm true Sir Martin still, With a Tronny, &amp;c. 10 And now to let you see, with a Hey, &amp;c. What Miracles there can be, with a Ho: The Head of the Church, Left the Body in the lurch, With a Tronny, &amp;c. 11 Damn the Good Old Cause, with a Hey, &amp;c. Religion and its Laws, with a Ho: I scorn to bear the Sway, By an English way, With a Tronny, &amp;c. 12 Let the Gentry groan, with a Hey, &amp;c. With the Weight of my Throne, with a Ho: I care not a Straw For the old Fop-Law, With a Tronny, &amp;c. 13 While the French take Towns, with a Hey, &amp;c. And the Seamen get Wounds, with a Ho: I have a French Arse For my unruly Tarse, With a Tronny, &amp;c. 14 And tho my Father, like a Fool, with a Hey, &amp;c. Lost his Life, to save his Soul, with a Ho, I'll not quit my present Love, For a Martyr's Place above, With a Hey Tronny Nonny Nonny no. SATIRE. Thus long the wise Commons have been in debate, 'Bout Mony and Conscience, those Trifles of State, While dang'rous Grievances daily increase, And the Subject can't riot in Safety and Peace; Unless, as against Irish Cattel before, You now make an Act against Irish Whore. The Colts black and white, Clanbrazie and Cox, Invade us with Impudence, Beauty, and Pox: Each carries a Fate no Man can oppose, Without Loss of his Heart, or Fall of his Nose. Is it just that with Love cruel Death should conspire, And our Tarses be burnt by our Hearts taking fire? There's no end of Communion, if humble Believers Must be damn'd in the Cup like unworthy Receivers. The Queen's Ball. Reform, Great Queen, the Errors of your Youth, And hear a thing you never heard, call'd Truth. Poor private Balls content the Fairy Queen; You must dance, and dance damnably to be seen. Ill-natur'd little Goblin, and design'd For nothing but to dance and vex Mankind. What wiser thing could our great Monarch do, Than root Ambition out by shewing you? You can the most aspiring Thoughts pull down: For who would have his Wife to have his Crown? With a white Vizor you may cheat our Eyes; You know a black one would be no Disguise. See in her Mouth a sparkling Diamond shine, The first good thing that e'er came from that Mine. Heav'n some great Curse upon that Hand dispense, That for th'Increase of Nonsense takes it thence. How gracefully she moves, and strives to lug A weight of Riches that may sink the Pug! Such Fruit ne'er loaded so deform'd a Tree; Her Jewels may be match'd, but never she. If bold Acteon in the Waves had seen In fair Diana's room our Puppet Queen, He would have fled; and in his full career, For greater haste, have wish'd himself a Deer; Prefer'd the Bellies of his Dogs to hers, And thought them the more cleanly Sepulchres. What stupid Madman would not chuse to have The settled Rest and Silence of a Grave, Rather than such a Hell, which always burns, And from whom Nature forbids all Returns? Orm?d looks paler now than when he rid; Your Visit frights him more than Tyburn did. Fear of your Coming does not only make Wor?r's wise Marquis, but his House too shake. What will be next, unless you please to go And dance among your Fellow-Fiends below? There as upon the Stygian Lake you float, You may o'erset and sink the laden Boat; While we the Fun'ral Rites devoutly pay, And dance for Joy that you are danc'd away. The Character. The Lords and Commons having had their Doom, The banish'd Romans now supply their room; And in full Herds they publickly appear, Bearding both Protestant and Presbyter. Yet do not so resent the foul Affront, To take up Arms, and make Rebellion on't: Nor do not sleep, but by the Drum and Fife, To keep thy Throat from bloody Jesuit's Knife: Tho Murder be in us a bloody Fact, In holy Priests it is a holy Act. If Priest and Knife be consecrated then, By Blood and Massacre they Heaven win; While we, poor Souls! are damn'd for the same Sin. Who would not be a sacred Priest to Rome, Since they can save, or give eternal Doom? Make Virtue damn'd, and meritorious Vice They snatch'd from Hell, and sent to Paradise. And more to confirm their farther Glory, They call and take a touch in Purgatory. Now that the Bugbear Parliament is fled, Bold were the Man durst say that Godfrey's dead: That i'th' Queen's Slaughter-house his Blood was shed, Or she consent to have him murdered. Or who dares say the Temple was on fire, By the contrivance of some Priest or Fry'r? To burn Commissions hid in Langhorn's Room, To blind the Plot, and clear the Lords of Rome. O Parliament most weak, that could'st not see, Thy self dissolv'd by thy own Treachery! Contending with thy King, his Laws and Pow'r, Intrenching on's Prerogative each hour; Flying i'th' Face of his Supremacy, With saucy Privilege and Liberty. Had ever Men such reason to comply, When e'en the Nation's Ruin is so nigh? Had you been wise, and given the King a Sum, You might have had your swinge at bloody Rome. Finding no Coin, we cannot find the Plot; The Jesuits have the Bag, and so 'tis not. The Priest quick-sighted wisely did the Feat, Made thee thus little, and himself thus great; And well he might, when York was in the Cheat. The Serpent's Seed is now abroad agen, Great Hell's Long Parliament is rais'd from's Den, To teach young Colt his black Rebellion, Form'd and begot by the old damn'd Stallion, Whose pregnant Issue's quick and nimble Sense Exactly copies the Sire's Impudence; Treading his Steps with full and violent Force, Flies in the Face of Majesty in course: The young out-throws the old at least a Bar, For he but only 'gainst the King made War. This Start-up, bold in big and thund'ring Words, Beards both the King, his Bishops, and his Lords, And would assume at once, and at one hour, The Royal Office, and the Sovereign Pow'r. D?by's the first shall to the Slaughter go, 'Tis we, the Commons, do command it so. As King and Peers were Shepherds in the State, And they the only Figures of Debate. Traitor and Parliament do seem two Things, But equal is the venom of their Stings. Against Prerogative they plead Privilege, That fatal By-blow with a double Edg, The Pride o'th' Parliament, the Country's Pledg; By which they're jilted, and ne'er thought a Curse, The Commons and the Countries tender Nurse; And for their Health they let 'em Blood i'th' Purse. You call t'account what Men with Mony have done: Let me ask you where all your Wisdom's gone? 'Tis plain to Foreign Monarchs you have none. Where is it then? with you 'twas left in trust; Come you to th'Bar, and prove if you are just. The Court has sworn it ne'er shall harbour there, Wisdom's a Burden fit for Beasts to bear: The City does not value it i'th' least, Because it does not bring them Interest. The Clergy are so full, so stuff'd with Grace, There is no room for Wisdom in that Place. The Lawyers have such knavish Quirks and Tricks, That Wisdom scorns with such base Dross to mix: By search we've found what Person let it pass, It was exhausted as the Treasure was. The Chancellor has confess'd, with much ado, It was embezel'd in a Speech or two. Th' infatuated Jews, their Sense being gone, Made War among themselves, and still fought on, Till they were conquer'd by Vespasian. So you fall out like sensless Stones and Stocks, Flying at each other ev'n like Dogs at Cocks: To satisfy your Pride, you split on Rocks. You've made a Vote, the Land will arm the Sea, Because the King and Peers will not obey; Your Engine Chiv'rell has set forth in brief Reasons why you ought to command in chief. Your Pride obstructs your Great Affair each Hour, By your too saucy Privilege and Power. In short, your renown'd Character is this: A Curse you're to the Nation, not a Bliss. The House of Commons is the Rabble's God, The Courtiers Scourge, the Bishops Iron Rod, The Lords Vexation, and the King's by—. The D. of B's Litany. From a proud sensual Atheistical Life?

Controversial Letters between a suppos'd Atheist, and J. D. Minister of ? in Surrey. [First Letter] Sir John, for so in times preceding All Priests were call'd, I find by reading; I wonder what a Plague's the Reason, That you are given so to Leasing: For when at Tavern you forsook me, You said, you'd come agen to look me; And yet you never made appearance, According to my old Experience. I trusted you, because a Parson, But such a one, I say, my A? on; Neither to bring thy Snout nor Purse in, G?, you are hardly worth the cursing. 'Tis strange that you, whose Zeal's so hot, Should break your Word for I know not what; When I, in whom but small Zeal known is, Still keep my Word cum viris bonis: Such whose Throats whole Bumpers swallow, As if they were made glib with Tallow; And could thy Glass so soon be empty, Thou need'st not preach while I tell twenty: For you by Measure tell your Tale, As well as Tapster sells his Ale; But he, sly Rogue! has got a trick, To cheat Mankind with Froth and Nick. And why mayn't you, now he has taught ye, By half the Glass instruct the Naughty? Few words are best, the Preacher tells you, 'Tis Pride that to so many swells you: And there's a word, be sure you scape it, Viz. Loquitur qui pauca sapit. But now— I would relate some pleasant Passages, Could I but mix my Lines like Sausages; And hang 'em so to one another, That one might be drawn in by t'other. Yet come, I'll venture at 'em bolder, And bring 'em in by head and shoulder; As Debtor often is by Bayly, Because he does of Payment fail you. And thus have at it: Mrs. Mary, Who us'd to be so coy and wary, Is marry'd, mauger her Ambition, To one whose best Name is Musician. But Truth to tell, and solve the Riddle, 'Tis one that lives, Jack, by his Fiddle. Which when I heard, I went to visit her, About old Stories to sollicit her: And offer'd her a Gown, or so Sir, To manage her; but she cry'd, No Sir. Tho in few days, when Gold was tender'd, Kind Rogue! she quietly surrender'd. Almighty Gold! that has no Equal, As you will find, Jack, by the Sequel, I forc'd the Fidler to administer His Wife to me, by means most sinister: Nay more, to make our Joys sublime, He play'd, while we in Bed kept Time. And when we had enough o'th' Fiddle, He came to Bed, which seems a Riddle, And still his Wife lay in the middle. Was not this rare Life, void of Sorrow? Give it me, tho I die to-morrow. But you for length of days make Pray'r, Tho they be fill'd with Grief and Care: When I in one Week, Jack, do live More than thy Life-time can retrieve. Is't not a tiresom piece of Nonsense To talk of Heav'n, of Hell and Conscience? Words only feign'd to help the Law To keep the Multitude in awe. Would it not make one mad to see How damnably you disagree? To think how much you Priests do vary? The Catholick says Ave-Mary, The English Churchman does refuse it, And the damn'd Puritan abuse it. Thus you have differently display'd Religion in Masquerade, And live by it as by a Trade. This Talk perhaps you strange will think, But now I'm call'd away to drink, And have no leisure to excuse it, Therefore I pray once more peruse it. And if you find a Thought too bold is, Tell it your Friend A. O. Second LETTER. The Parson's Answer. Alex. For your ungodly Letter I must confess I am your Debtor; Which I've oblig'd my self to answer, To keep you from the Devil your Grandsire: Then be not angry, I beseech you, If better I pretend to teach you. And now to turn you Arsi-versie, For which I scarce expect Gramercy, You know much better than you mention Of Priests the damnable Dissension; Which I perceive so much affects you, That to mere Atheism it directs you. But know, thou Man of Maggot gentle, Thy Time and Humours are both spent ill; With Wheedles striving to cajole Thy Reason, and to damn thy Soul. For tho so much we disagree, Yet all believe a Deity: Nor doubt we of Heav'n, Hell, or Conscience, All which you treat as downright Nonsense. And you would force your self to credit, Merely because your self has said it: Or may be you have been too bold in Pleasures, you're loth to be controul'd in; And so are willing to be thinking There is no Heav'n but Punch and Drinking: Which if you thought a Hell attending, You would no doubt full soon be mending. This will, because 'tis void of ranting, Appear to you a sort of Canting; And by your Maggot Instigation, To scorn us give you fresh Occasion; Since I better do defend Those Truths, which I to teach pretend. But let it pass; judg what you will on't, I'm still resolv'd not to be silent. Think then, dear Friend, if you to-morrow Were to return the Breath you borrow; Could you with Resolution mighty Leave all those Follies that delight you, Without a thought that might affright you? Then when your Soul goes to inherit Rewards, your Actions justly merit; And has a Prospect, tho too late, Of what must ever be its Fate; Condemn'd in the same Flesh to find Pains for the Pleasures left behind. Justly they're both alike tormented, 'Cause both on Earth alike consented. Dear Rogue, believe now I'm serious In what I say, there's nothing various. But grant it were not so, yet surely It were but dying more securely: Believe it then, lest you should know By sad Experience it is so. And now to shew you, I'll not spare you, I will proceed to Mrs. Mary; Whose easy Conquest you repeated, As if you had all Hell defeated. A pleasant Victory to brag on! Did she engage you like a Dragon, With Sting in Tail, prepar'd with Poison? Why this you might have made a noise on: But since she was no more than Woman, The Victory methinks is common. But first of me you are complaining, Because I was from you abstaining; And urge my Promise to come to you, Which you could ne'er expect— Since you were satisfy'd I knew you: For had I come,— My Nose had ne'er been made a Bridg on, And then be sure good-night Religion. Restless we'ad roll'd from Crown to Mitre, Till Paunch had made our Purse the lighter; And till we had in Circulation Been drunk with all the Wines in fashion. And thus more in one Week you live, Than all my Life-time shall receive: Yet be advis'd,— And let no more your Follies guide you, But trust your Friend and Servant, J. D. Third LETTER. To the Parson. Parson; What makes thee thus like silly Widgeon, Debauch Burlesque with dull Religion? Dost think, thou Coxcomb, with a murrain, 'Twas made for thee to keep a stir in? That 'twas design'd for thee to prate on, And tell us Tales of dirty Satan? Now P? upon thee, paultry Parson, Thou'st writ me Word of true Sense scarce one. But not to turn you topsy-turvy, As my Epistle you do scurvy; I have beyond what you expected, To you in this my Thanks directed: The care you take to save my Spirit, No less Acknowledgment does merit. But O thou Man in Gospel skilful, Thou talk'st to me as bold and wilful, As to the godly Wife of Farmer, When with thy Noise thou mean'st to charm her: But know, thou Heav'nly Pettifogger, These will not sink into my Logger— You know my meaning by my mumping, For good Wits ever will be jumping, And Parsons Pulpit-Cushions thumping: It lays more weight upon the Sentence, And hectors Folks into Repentance. And truth is, Thumps are much more weighty Than any thing that they can say t'ye; And I believe turn many Sinners, Especially if young Beginners. But Priest, thou know'st it, I'm an old one In Vice, as thou say'st, and a bold one. Why should'st thou hope then to abuse me, And to mere Godliness seduce me? Lord! what a Question thou wert starting! You bid me think my self departing; Then ask me if no Thought would fright me: Yes faith! it plaguily would spite me To leave this Life that does delight me. My Moll would think it much uneven, Should I relinquish her for Heaven, Since she for me has that neglected: You see how much, Jack, I'm respected; But why did'st wish her Tail infected? Thou dost, because I have her cock-sure, Desire that she may get the Pox sure: But let that pass, and hear how neatly You preach to me a devilish great Lye; Thy Soul, dear Friend, O have a care on't, Will feel strange Pains in Hell, I warrant, Because she lets thy Flesh controul her, And on a baudy Wench cajole her: For which thy Flesh too shall know Sorrows, And bear a part in th'Hellish Chorus. This is your Hell, you tell me whining; Now hear how 'tis of my defining: There shall some little huffing Demon, Whom you, 'tis like, did never dream on Altho you were the greatest Bully, Put false Dice on you, as on Cully. There if you go a Wench to pick up, You shall be plagu'd with such a Hickup, That for your Blood you shall not utter One word of Sense to make her foutre. But if by chance you be so happy, By sacred D'avenant's Nose she'll clap you; And for your Wine, drink little or much on't, The devilish Quality is such on't, That 'twill recal those Pleasures past, Of which you ne'er again shall taste; 'Twill make you talk of Friend and Mistress, And lead you into plaguy Distress: 'Tis full of Brimstone, Tartar, Lime, 'Tis always rack'd, and never fine; And tho it still provoke your loathing, This either you must drink, or nothing. Thus I have told you my Opinion, Of sooty Beelzebub's Dominion: But you would stretch my Faith's Dimension, To credit Hell of your Invention, And counsel me to live demurely, That I may die the more securely. But dost thou think I'll baulk the Humour, Because of thirsty hellish Rumour? No more, good John, for all your Lying, There is no Hell but that of dying: Unless— To Men, and such I hope but few are, That do believe thy Stories true are: Such may indeed be strangely pond'ring On some sad Place to which they're wand'ring. And faith, methinks, thou should'st not sleep well, For thus distracting silly People. I know this Letter will inspire Your Thoughts with a most zealous Fire, And you will still at Rhyme be nibbling, And plague me daily with your scribbling; 'Till I am forc'd to say, controul'd lies, Your Servant, A. O. The Fourth LETTER. In Answer to the former. Dear Friend, Your Letter I with Grief perus'd, Finding therein Heav'n and your self abus'd: Which yet I hope is rather the Effect Of Humour, than of either a Neglect: However, lest it may too aptly find A real Entertainment in your Mind, I have once more endeavour'd to revive Reason, that may incite you to believe. But first your timely Caution I'll commend, I'll stile you less a Satirist than Friend: For 'tis preposterous to dress, and say Matters so serious in a Stile so gay: It robs them of their Weight and their Esteem, Men waking scorn the Terrors of a Dream. So because I did great Concerns express In too light Measures, they to you seem'd less. But now an apter Stile I chuse to show, How little you to your great Reason owe. Reason, that's lent you for a better end, Than thus its sacred Author to offend: Reason that did against it self dispute, For which my Reason I would yours confute: Reason, that like a base and cunning Enemy, Does Faith in th'Art, not Strength of Mind defy: Why generous Faith, in parley much too weak, Stands fair to all the Blows its Force can make. These mighty Rivals for thy Soul dispute, Be valiant and reject bold Reason's Suit; That but an earthly Pleasure does propose, This heav'nly Joys which you shall never lose. Say, if you can, who was't before your Birth That gave you Life, or who 'twas made the Earth? If all things, as you say, of Nature be, Then you of Nature make a Deity. Ah! miserable wilful Ignorance, Thus to a God a Notion to advance. Is Holy Writ so mean in your Esteem, That you no more regard it than a Dream? Can you contemn its just Authority, Rejecting all its Offers as a Lye? Why should you think an honest harmless Priest Should thus design to lead you in a Mist? Were there no God, why should not he, like you, Indulge himself in sinful Pleasures too? You think, perhaps, his dull Capacity, In flight of Reason, cannot soar so high, As to confirm him in his Sophistry. Does all the learned World, but your good Sect, Wander in Paths to Truth most indirect? I'm of Opinion, you as probably May err, as those that own a Deity. Does your proud Maggot so abuse your Sense, To make you think ours but a weak Pretence, And only yours the mighty Argument? For shame of so unjust a Pride repent. If dull Religion, as you call it, be A Cheat, what need the Actors disagree? What need they different Opinions frame, When they by one alone might reach the same? You'd not care how, so you did win the Game. Strange Light of Nature, which your Will directs Nothing to see, but what your Light affects: But now I'm thinking of the Hell you made; Ah! to what future Grief you are betray'd? To this, I fancy, with some small amends, You, as to Heav'n, will recommend your Friends. Let but the Wine be good, and Gaming square, You'd not repine to live for ever there: And let the Miss be sound, and 'tis compleat, These would to you be Joys divinely sweet. You'd with those sensual Pleasures ever last, And fear Eternity made too much haste. The old Elysium would be too severe, There drinking is not A-la-Mode I fear; But Mahomet's Paradise comes very near. Howe'er it be, pray God you be so wise, To keep your self out of Fool's Paradise; There, I'm afraid, your self at last you'll find, Led on by Reason, that blind Guide o'th'Mind. Thro Labyrinths of Thought, and envious Ways, It will conduct you to the fatal Place, And leave you there— Naked to Shame, to Horror, and Amaze. O then, from such Idolatry refrain, To worship the Chimeras of your Brain. Make not your Faith your Reason's Sacrifice, Which only does prevail in Fallacies: Thus you the Deity the Victim make, And for the God the Sacrifice mistake. As by Rebellion Subjects oft become Lords of their Monarch, and pronounce his Doom: So Reason, to your wicked Nature join'd, Rebels 'gainst Faith, whose Slave it was design'd. For your own sake these fatal Errors mend, And by your Penitence make glad your Friend, J. D. The Fifth LETTER. In compliance to you, dull serious Maggot, Another kind of Stile you see I ha' got: For I have chang'd my Measure, learned Stoick, From plain Burlesque, into Burlesque Heroick: And all I gather can from thy Discourse Is, prithee Friend be sober, and wear Whiskers; Or something to that purpose not worth minding, No more than Straw or Cherry-stones worth finding. You first begin to tell me how you're pester'd, To think my Soul should with such Skin be fester'd. And truly, Parson John, I take't unkindly, That you would have me led about so blindly; Denying me the blessed use of Reason, 'Tis on this Ground you build this pious Treason. And could you once deprive me of that Engine, I quickly might believe all said by Sir John; Therefore, I think, you'ad e'en best take it from me, Or I much doubt you'll never overcome me. But how that must be done I can't imagine; No Faith, I know no way that you may fadg in, Unless by means unlawful and uncivil, By sending me too early to the Devil. But, prithee, what i'th' name of—urges Thee thus to huff at Reason like a Burgess? And to no more effect than brutish Zealot, Led on by Faith— Reviles the Stage and Taverns that we reel at. Alas, poor Reason! he has banish'd thee; So thou, and not in vain, repair'st to me: For I'll in thy Defence be very furious, But first of thy Disgrace the Cause assure us. Did'st thou rebel 'gainst Faith, and jeer the Squire, Or did'st thou tell him plainly, that he was a Lyar? Or did'st thou else his Nakedness expose, Both to the sight of Eye, and scent of Nose? Or, prithee, tell me, let me know all truly, And I'll redress thy Grievances as duly. He tells Mr. Parson, that in good faith and sooth, Reason and himself were at it Nail and Tooth. And that at last the Squire Faith arose, And kick'd him; so they went from Words to Blows: Reason too quick— Laid Faith upon his Back, and in the fall Tore his long Garment, and discover'd all Between his Legs, that on it was before on; The first thing Reason saw was Mah'met's Alcoran: On his left Leg Aaron, like Corps embalmed, In Robes of Parchment hung the Jewish Talmud; And next within the right side of his Vestment, In a large fair Print was a Greek Test'ment. Many and various were the Glosses on it; And some to this, and some to that vail Bonnet. And 'bout this Book, like Fools, hung to be dry'd there, Millions of Oaphs whom Faith had slily ty'd there, Who by so small a Thred were link'd to Saviour, That you would think them bound to good Behaviour, Which they ne'er had nor knew.— These shew'd the Paint which they were drest so rich in, Like Hen and Chicken hanging in a Kitchin. Reason was going to look on one more nearly, But Faith repuls'd him with his Foot severely; And presently roar'd out for you t'assist him; You came, and saw Faith down:— So would not Reason hear, but strait dismiss'd him. Now the Discourse on which began the Quarrel, Was this: Faith swore— The Tun of Heidelberg was but a Barrel. Reason had often seen't, and help'd to make it; Now Faith did only upon hearsay take it. Then had not Reason cause to contradict him, As he declar'd he did, for which Faith kick'd him? Reason, abus'd by you, me Guardian chose, Resolv'd no longer to be led by th'Nose, By Fables of Faith's making— It seems before they'ad had another bout, 'Cause Reason could not make Faith's Story out: For Faith was telling of one Sampson, who A Thousand with an Ass's Jaw-bone slew; Which Reason vow'd he ne'er could think was true. Thus you may see they've many Bickerings had, Enough to make my Friend, good Reason, mad; But that he now no more with Faith will dwell, Who kept him long in awe with Tales of Hell. But from those needless Fears, and him releas'd, Reason forsakes him quite, makes him a Jest; So that of Consequence he must turn Beast, Or something monstrous, as he was before. Reason refin'd his Sense; and now no more Will ought but pious Fools irrational Faith adore. With sensless Vulgar now he must take up his Quarters, They will do him the Honour to be torn his Martyrs. As heretofore in Smithfield People perish'd, For a mere darling Whimsey, which they cherish'd. The Vision. 1. I had an easy Dose of Wine o'er Night, Neither too heavy, nor too light, But just enough to make me sleep; Without which I too certain Vigils keep. Strange Force of Custom that can tame The Rash, or set the Wise on flame! But long I did not rest, E'er Fumes dispel'd gave place To painful Thoughts which were by them suppress'd, And which too soon at last Death's kind Resemblance did deface, Making Night's quiet Minutes anxious as the Days, And with more Terror pass. 2. I dreamt, O Horror to repeat! And yet I waking see't; The miserable Image of Mankind Still haunts my Mind, E'er since that fatal Night it first appear'd; When with a Visage pale and thin, Joints loose, and Nerves remiss, Eyes fixt and dull, and ev'ry Member out of frame, To my Bed-side it came, And did begin Sadly to utter this With low and hollow Voice scarce to be heard. 3. Least of my Care, give ear, And tremble at the words you hear; Alas! I faint, I'll come more near. My Words too much do on my Spirits prey; I must obey My Weakness, and sit down, Till I recover Breath. He said no more, But slowly bending with an uneasy Frown Moan'd, while my Fears had almost brought my Death, But that with them a superstitious Zeal increas'd, To Heaven I my self address'd; Till he began a little louder than before. 4. I am, said he, The Genius of Mankind, Humanity. For that to the deplorable Estate, By a sad Fate, By the Rebellion of each part, My erring Feet pretending to give Laws Ev'n to their King my Head, Each Member is by Contradiction led. My Tongue does dictate to my Heart, My Eyes are in vast Prospects lost, My wand'ring Thoughts are tost From this to that, yet cannot find the Cause. 5. Discord does ev'ry where preside, And giddy factious Pride Usurps the Government of all. This his Opinion would on that impose, A third the contrary erects; Hence such Misfortune grows, That each intends his own, and publick Good neglects. Thus I at last must miserably fall, But no longer can discourse On things so painful to my Thought: My Griefs are of too great a force, These Truths thou shalt another way be taught. Look round about thee from this Hill, And see the World grow madder still. 6. I look'd methought, and did with Wonder gaze To find my self on such a lofty Place, Where all the World did seem Lower than Valleys do appear, To Men that stand on the usurping Ground. Then I began afresh to fear Lest he would throw me headlong down; But then again I thought 'twas but a Dream. Then strait he thus began; Fear not, O Man! But with a piteous Eye, Behold Mankind's unhappy Tragedy, Behold thy own as well as others Misery. 7. Then looking down, I saw the Earth turn round, And giddy Man reeling from Doubt to Doubt, As if the Motion of the Globe infected him. But Oh! Drunk with Opinion of himself, His Vessel on the Ocean tost, He split upon the fatal Shelf Of his own Pride, whence all his Sorrows grow: Or else to Sea by Ignorance set out Is miserably lost, And sunk in vent'ring to swim. O Ignorance profound! Deeper than are the Seas in which the Vessel drown'd. 8. But now a horrid and confused Cry Strikes my Ear and draws my Eye Another way; and there, alas! Malice above all other Passions does prevail, Men by each other die: The bloody Grass Bears witness of the foolish Guilt. How weak, how frail Is Man, that merely for another's Fame, Or his own ambitious Aim, Prostrates his Blood thus to be spilt! Forgotten in the Grave, With a cold Epitaph, O valiant! or O brave! Now whether shall I weep or laugh? 9. Here by his Brother one is kill'd; A Father here to his own Son does yield, Kneels, and intreats a Life for that he gave. The Viper does refuse; And O eternal Shame! Tears out the Bowels whence he came. And neither will his Parent, nor his Virtue save; But deaf to both, does both abuse, And in that monstrous Act does all Mankind accuse. And now at last a Peace is made, A little Gold for all that Blood and Guilt has paid. Thus, merely thus for Gold Man is bought and sold, His Life expos'd for that, for that betray'd. 10. And now the fighting Fools retire, Their Rage consum'd in its own Fire; Now on both sides are given Prayers and Thanks for Victory to Heaven: Heav'n that favour'd neither side, But did them both deride, Made both its Sport; As Men to see the Bulls, and Bears, and other Creatures fight, resort. Poor wretched Man! from whom are hid The things he most does court: Desire of Knowledg is his Punishment, Never content, Still searching after hidden Light, And lost in darkest Shades of Night. 11. Thus I reflected, till at last, Turning my Head, I saw a Throng Of zealous and religious Fools; Some on the Ground were prostrate cast, Speaking more with Looks than Tongue, And Gestures learnt from godly Schools. Here one with Arms expanded, on his Knees Strives t'embrace th'Ideas of his Faith; Courting in hope the better Life, his Death, And greedily of Hope th'imperfect Pleasures sees, Till Heat of Zeal and Fancy fails, and lets him freeze. Others to Dress Religion would confine, And think the plainest Men the most Divine. Some are with Faith so blind, and so much void of Sense, Ty'd to their own Opinion, that with Joy they give Themselves to hasty Death, disdaining then to live, When living, they to Heav'n must give Offence. O fond Belief! O Death to be desir'd Before the Joys of Life, or ought that's here admir'd! On the Marriage of the Prince and Princess of Orange. Hail happy Warrior! whose Arms have won The fairest Jewel in the English Crown. Happy in th'horrid Dangers of the Field; Happy in Courts, which brightest Beauties yield. O Prince, whose Soul is known so truly great! Whom Heav'n did seem to take time to create: First the rich Ore refin'd, then did allay, Stamp'd thee his own, not shuffled thee away. With wonder thus we thy cool Temper prize, Not but thou art as brave and bold as wise. Like the true English, who approach their Fate With Awe, and gravely first with Death debate: They kindle slowly, but when once on fire, Burn on, and in the Blaze of Fame expire. Hail Princess! Hail thou fairest of thy kind! Thou Shape of Angels with an Angel's Mind! Whose Virtues shine, but so as to be borne, Clear as the Sun, and gentle as the Morn. Whose radiant Eyes like lambent Glory move; And ev'ry Glance wounds like a Dart of Love. How well, O Prince, how nobly hast thou fought, Since to thy Arms such Charms the Fates have brought! Methinks I hear thee in the Nuptial Bed, When o'er the Royal Maid thy Arms were spread: Enough, kind Heav'n! well was my Sword employ'd, Since all the Bliss Earth holds shall be enjoy'd. Pains I remember now with vast Delight, Well have I brav'd the thund'ring French in Fight: My Hazards now are Gains; and if my Blood In Battel mix, and swell the vulgar Flood, Her Tears (for sure she'll be so good to mourn) Like Balm, shall heal the Wounds when I return. But hark! 'tis rumour'd that this happy Pair Must go; the Prince for Holland does declare, Call'd to the dreadful Business of the War. Go then; if thy Departure is decreed, Thy Friends must weep, thy Enemies shall bleed. And if in Poets Minds, their vaster Souls, Where all at once the whole Creation rolls; To whom the Warrior is as much oblig'd, As to Relievers, Towns that are besieg'd; For Death would to their Acts an end afford, Did not immortal Verse out-do the Sword: If ought of Prophecy their Thoughts inspire, And if their Fury give a solid Fire; Soft shall your Waftage be, the Seas and Wind Calm as the Prince, and as the Princess kind: The World why should not Dreams of Poets take As well as Prophets, who but dream awake? I saw the Ship the Prince and Princess bore, While the sad Court stood crouding on the Shore: The Prince still bowing on the Deck did stand, And held his weeping Princess by the Hand: Which waving oft she bid them all farewel, And wept as if she would the Ocean swell. Farewel the best of Fathers, best of Friends, While the mov'd Duke with a hurl'd Sigh commend To Heav'n his Care; in Tears his Eyes would swim, But manly Virtue binds them in the brim. Farewel, she cry'd, my Sister, thou dear Part, Thou sweetest part of my divided Heart: To whom I all my Secrets did unfold; Dear Casket, who dost all my Treasure hold. My Sister, O!—her Sighs did then renew, Once more, O Heav'n, a long and last Adieu! The Lord Chancellor's Speech to the Parliament. Would you send Kate to Portugal, Great James to be a Cardinal? And make Prince Rupert Admiral? This is the time. Would you turn D?y out of Doors, Banish Italian and French Whores, That worser sort of Common-Shores? This is the time. Would you unravel Popish Plots, Send Laud?le among the Scots, And rid the Court of Irish Sots? This is the time. Would you exalt the mighty Name Of Shaftsbury and Buckingham, And not forget Judg Scroggs's Fame? This is the time. Would you our Sov'reign disabuse, And make his Parliament of use, Not to be chang'd like dirty Shoes? This is the time. Would you extirpate Pimps and Panders, Disband the rest of our Commanders, Send Mulg?ve after Teague to Flanders? This is the time. Would you give Bellasis his Due, And hang him if his Crime proves true, Send Petre to his Name-sake Hugh? This is the time. Would you send Confessors to tell Powis, Stafford, Arundel, They must prepare their Souls for Hell? This is the time. Would you remove our Ministers, The cursed Causes of our Fears, Without forgetting Turn-coat Meers? This is the time. Would you hang those who take Example By Clar?n and Timber Temple, For all such Rascals merit Hemp well? This is the time. Would you once bless the English Nation, By changing of Queen Kate's Vocation, And find one fit for Procreation? This is the time. Would you let Portsmouth try her Chance, Believe Oates, Bedloe, Dugdale, Prance, And send Barillon home to France? This is the time. Would you turn Papists from the Queen, Cloister up fulsom Mazarine, And once more make Charles King agen? This is the time. The Answer. I should be glad to see Kate going, And Great James to our Church returning, And Prince Rupert Admiralling, At any time. But to turn D?y out of Doors, Or join his Name to Common-Shores, None will say but Sons of Whores, At any time. I'd beg t'unravel Popish Plots, To send Laud?le to rule the Scots, And rid all Places of all Sots, At any time. But for exalting of the Name Of Shaftsbury and Buckingham, Let him who knows them be the Man, And do't how and when he can At any time. But to remember Scroggs's Name, And to proclaim his real Fame, I could most gladly be the Man At all times. There's none our Sov'reign will abuse, Or say the Parliament's of no use, But Rogues who're bred in filthy Stews, And smell more rank than dirty Shoes At this time. I'm for disbanding Pimps and Panders, As fast as Country kills old Glanders, Prove Mulgrave, Teague, send him to Flanders; But to encourage good Commanders At all times. I'm for giving Bellasis his Due, Hang him and all that are untrue, But know not where to find old Hugh At this time. Then to send Confessors to tell, Powis, Stafford, Arundel, Unless they repent, they'll go to Hell, I say would do most wondrous well At this time. But to remove our Ministers, Without the Truths of Grounds for Fears, Would be like Olivering Gears At this time. Hang those that take an ill Example, I say they merit Cords of Hemp well, But I know greater Rogues than Temple At this time. 'Tis God must bless our English Nation, He'll do't when Whoring's out of fashion, And Pimps shall leave their old Vocation; I wish for happy Procreation, At this time. I wish Barillon sent to France, Believe Oates, Bedloe, Dugdale, Prance, And would let Portsmouth have her Chance At this time. I would turn Papists from the Queen, No Cloister build for Mazarine, For she is certain Trump-Marine, But make Charles great as e'er he'as been At all times. But if you'd come to mend the Matter, Leave to dissemble, lye, and flatter, And use plain-dealing clear as Water At all times. Satire on old Rowley. 1 How our good King does Papists hate At ev'ry coming Sessions! Then of his Laws he'll nothing bate, But make perhaps some fresh ones. At other times he's rul'd by's Brother, As was his Father by his Mother. 2 Silly and sauntering he goes From French Whore to Italian, Unlucky in whate'er he does, An old ill-favour'd Stallion. Fain the good Man would live at Ease, And ev'ry Punk and Party please. 3 Now he by Hyde, then Clifford rules, Osborne and up-start Fellows; When the Whores want, they're Knaves and Fools, As he himself can tell us. Till then tho Parliaments complain, He says they're rude, and hate his Reign. 4 A pretty Set he has at hand Of slimy Portsmouth's Creatures, G?n, Lory, Sund?d, French Gamesters and deep Betters: Who would reform this brutal Nation, And bring French Slavery in fashion. 5 King of three mighty Kingdoms he Thinks Beggars only loyal, Knaves wise, French true, and Popery Quite clear'd at Wakeman's Tryal. Nay, what seem'd never to be done, The Chits have made him hate his Son. 6 Rise drousy Prince, like Sampson shake These green Wyths from about thee, Banish their Dalilah, and make Thy People no more doubt thee. In vain they fright thee with a War, Thou art not hated, tho they are. 7 Rogue, Knave, and Bigot all love thee, Because they fear thy Brother, Queen Mary's Days they would not see, And can expect no other. No Misery a Land can want, Rul'd by a Fool, Goat, Tyrant, Saint. 8 Men say we act like Forty Two, Yet none tells thee the Reason; Yet when the same Diseases grow, Like Medicines come in season. Twice we thy Armies have o'erthrown, And without Blood voted them down. 9 Dukes thou creat'st, yet want'st an Heir; Thy Portuguese is barren; Marry again, and ne'er despair In this leud Age we are in. Some Harry Jarmyn will be found, To get an Heir fit to be crown'd. 10 Thy Brother York would come to Blows, While thou art yet in Being; He shall not rule as now he does, While thou art yet foreseeing. But if thou'rt wise, deceive his Hope, Leave him to Irish, French, and Pope. 11 Thou dost not use the Pow'r in hand, Yet for the Ills that are done, When Rogues pretend thy own Command, Thou'rt ready with a Pardon; As if 'twere thy Prerogative, That Murd'rers, Knaves, and Traytors live. 12 For shame give o'er; new Counsels chuse, If with the Eyes of others Thou need'st must see, thy Nation's use, And not thy Popish Brother's. Brother to Brother should be kind, Yet bear thee Littleton in mind. SATIRE. Quem Natura negat dabit Indignatio Versum. I who from drinking ne'er could spare an hour, But what I gave to some obedient Whore, Who hate all Satire, whether sharp or dull, From Dryden to the Governour of Hull; Provok'd at length to a Poetick Rage, Resolve to share in railing at the Age. I cannot Poet turn with worse Success, Than thousand Fools who now infest the Press; Whose sensless Works proclaim'd in ev'ry Street, Like saucy Beggars, worry all they meet. At ev'ry Shop, while Shakespear's lofty Stile Neglected lies, to Mice and Worms a Spoil; Gilt on the Back, just smoaking from the Press, Th'Apprentice shews you Durfey's Hudibras, Crown's Mask, bound up with Settle's choicest Labours, And promises some new Essay of Babor's If you go off, as who the Devil would stay, He cries, Sir, Mr. Otway's last new Play, With th'Epilogue, which for the Duke he writ, So lik'd at Court by all the Men of Wit: I heard an Ensign of the Guards declare, That with him Shadwell was not to compare; He lik'd that Scene of Nicky Nacky more, Than all that Shadwell ever writ before. Was't not enough, that at his tedious Play I lavish'd half a Crown, and half a Day; But must I find, patch'd up at ev'ry Wall, Such Stuff that none can bear, who starves not at Whitehall? As Rascals changing Rags for Scarlet-Coats, Cudgel'd before set up to cut Whigs Throats; So ev'ry Blockhead, that can please the Court, Plucks up a Spirit, and turns Poet for't. They know not that a sensless fawning Praise Does both their Heroes and themselves disgrace; Praising York's Loyalty's like praising his Face: Charles only his base Treason cou'd forgive, And York alone so good a Brother leave. An Infamy so mean no Age has known, To seek from Rebels hands a Brother's Crown. From his confiding Friends he falsly ran, And was a full-grown Knave e'er yet a Man. The Quiet which on England he has brought, Appears in his still carrying on the Plot: Of which his Weakness the Foundation laid, And Obstinacy since has perfect made. In Scotland we a well drawn Model see Of what he purposes we once shall be. By Coleman's Speech at Tyburn too we find, He has a Heart that ne'er forgets his Friend. Coningsmark did not use a baser way, His wretched hireling Ruffians to betray; This Diff'rence only is betwixt them known, This murders for a Wife, that for a Throne. His Lady's a good Woman, God defend her! By why are we so fond of her Hans en Kelder? The Slave that thought he or his Seed should reign, As surely wish'd the King untimely slain. The one with Pox has long corrupted been, The other visited with his Father's Sin. Poor harmless Babe! that lab'ring in the Womb, To hated Light all o'er diseas'd wilt come: A wretched innocent Pledg to all the Nation, That Parents Crimes afflict their Generation. But while I thus on others Faults run on, I make the same which those I blame have done; Omit the Praises of our Gracious King, Which ev'ry Pen should trace, and ev'ry Tongue should sing, Ev'n God himself grew jealous of his Pow'r, And curs'd all those who Creatures durst adore. By God allow'd, by his People freely given, Our Charles's Empire is like that of Heaven. Those Praises do Idolatry declare, That make a Subject with a Monarch share. Let such as live by't then his Brother praise, A nobler Theme my loyal Stile shall raise. Let Dryden's Pen indulgent David blame, And brand his Friends with hated Rebels Name: He that could once call Charles a saunt'ring Cully, By Portsmouth sold, and jilted by Bitch Nelly; He that could once the Prince of Rebels praise, With the same Hand the Tories Cause may raise. A slavish Muse no Int'rest can advance, He writes as Parsons preach for Sustenance. A pamper'd Hero for the Duke's Applause, A cudgel'd Martyr to the whiggish Cause. A Cur that fawns on him that gave him Bread, And growls and snarls at all the World beside. Ungrateful, mercenary, fearful, mean, The best of Rhymers, and the worst of Men. While Charles reigns here, no Cloud can shade our Isle; Those who slight James's Frown, adore thy Smile. The threatning Storms that with thy Brother come, Dissolve like Clouds before thy pow'rful Sun. Spight of their Enemies, and of thy own, Thy Peoples duteous Love will e'er be shown. Happy thy Reign and Nestor's be thy Years, Vain Popish Hopes, and vain be all our Fears. May some brave Youth spring from thy Princly Blood, Like thee forgiving, prudent, great and good; Succeed thee late to this thy glorious Crown, And tumble all presumptive Hopers down. While England from her threaten'd Ills got free, In serving him, may still give thanks to thee. But to go on with my satirick Tale; (Who thinks on him will soon forget to rail) What Age like ours did e'er with Vice abound? A Protestant Officer may as soon be found, A Cuckold jealous, or a Countess sound, As one whose Honesty 'gainst all things proof, No Fear can shake, nor no Preferment move. Lost Reputations shall forget to meet, To club for nasty Verse in Jermin-street: And, ceasing Envy, th'Innocent and Fair, Shall hate the stiff-neck'd Priest, and love the Pray'r. Fools shall be wanting to disperse their Rhymes, And Shopkeepers no more complain of Times. The Scots and Irish homeward shall resort, And swarm no more about the English Court; The one industrious, t'other rich shall prove, Both shall grow honest, both shall English love, E'er I give o'er to lash the fulsome Slaves, To laugh at Coxcombs, and to rail at Knaves: Who are the Men who most Mankind disgrace, They in my Verse shall have the leading Place. The Knave of State, will all the sneaking Throng, Of under Rascals which to Court belong. Or should I of the hot-brain'd Clergy treat, Whose very Trade is naturally a Cheat; All over Lux'ry they at Vice declaim, Chide at ill Lives, and at good Livings aim. A Male converted still suspected proves; A Lady Convert, 'tis the B? loves. On Down they sleep, and upon Carpets tread, Their Ancestors, the Apostles, wanted Bread. Each lustful D? free licence has to whore, But the grave wary B? may do more. At home they lie with Pride, Spleen, Plenty stor'd, And hire some poor dull Rogue to serve the Lord. Where'er thou call'st, loud Scandal, will I fly, From the proud Statesman to the sniveling Spy; From Hallifax, whose Crimes now furnish Fame, Down to Fleet Shepherd's false and abject Name. The first, that he all Villains might exceed, His Honour sold for what he did not need. An Atheist once; now Popery has profess'd, Finding that suit with his good Morals best. He'as sold his Country, and his King abus'd, Join'd with scorn'd Chits, he'as Innocence accus'd, And is at last ev'n by those Chits refus'd. From Crime to Crime, he by degrees runs on, Not safe from one till he has a greater done. But he so false, and so contemn'd does grow, His Fellow-Rogues trust him no longer now; Yet use him still, and have found out a fit Employment for my Lord's prodigious Wit. For join'd with Roger, he with like Applause Does write dull railing Libels for the Cause. But he so often lyes to every Fool, That on that Theme his Son could scarce be dull. Seymour in every Quality does surpass, Which may a sensless sawcy Turncoat grace. By's breeding he for Cottrel's Place is fit, And may the Bantam courtly Envoy meet, And for his Learning may on Woolsack sit. For Eloquence he may grave Finch succeed, And for his Courage Tory Forces lead. These with his Knav'ry, Pride, and Country's Hate, Accomplish him for Minister of State. As Schoolboys heat their Gigs to make 'em calve, And from their old one a small Offspring have: So our diminutive Statesman Falkland looks, As if from Seymour fall'n at Arran's Strokes. Mony, we know, him to Preferment brought; He ought to hide how he the Mony got. Let Albemarle no more Desert pretend, That from the worthy Monk he does descend. His Title's all that by his Birth he gains, While his base Life the noble Fountain stains, The General's is lost, the Sempstress' Blood remains. The Father England's Freedom did regain, The Son conspires t'enslave it once again. Him a true Soldier of the Age we see, He has nor Courage, Sense, nor Honesty. A needless Foil to th'Hero he succeeds, That dares not justify the Guards he leads. Lord! how the Tories will the City rout, While he the Horse, and Grafton leads the Foot. In their Sires steps the H?s have better grown, Wh'entail'd it on his Line to cheat the Crown. Their Father was the Founder of that Ill, Which his two Sons are lab'ring to fulfil, Their Lordships stink of the old Lawyer still. The first to J?s his prostrate Daughter wed, Then brought a barren Imp to C? his Bed. To equal him his pious Sons, at strife, One cheats the Husband, t'other robs the Wife. The first for Mu?ve's famous Cuckold known, Does the King's Bastards starve to keep his own. D???by's Farewel. Farewel my Tom D?by, my Pimp and my Cheat, 'Twas for my own Ends I made you so great: The Plot is discover'd, our Mony's all spent, I'll leave you to hang and my self to repent. Our Masters the Commons begin now to war, And swear they will either have you or my Whore. Then D???by forgive me, if I am forsworn, And leave you to die like a Traitor forlorn. An Allusion. When Israel first provok'd the living Lord, He scourg'd their Sin with Famine, Plague, and Sword: Still they rebell'd; then God in's Wrath did fling No Thunderbolt among them, but a King. A James-like King was Heav'ns severest Rod, The utmost Vengeance of an angry God. God in his Wrath sent Saul to punish Jewry, And James to England in a greater Fury: For Saul in Sin was no more like our James, Than little Jordan can compare to Thames. The Prodigal. The Prodigal's return'd from Husks and Swine, Such was the first, and so, great Ch??es, is thine; Who to his Sov'reign's Favour did aspire, From's wall'wing in the Town, and Wapping Mire. The fatted Calf, this for a Convert slew; But e'er this Prodigal does prove so too, Oats shall turn honest, Armstrong shall prove true. The House then sign'd his Pardon: Death attends, Seal'd to ten thousand of thy dearest Friends. Swoln Asps and Adders on his Tongue do nest, E'er long thou'lt find 'em crawl into thy Breast: And that sly Snake which stung thy Brother's Heel, Him gnawing next within thy Heart thoul't feel. Thy Counsellors shall fall, thy Judges bleed, And Jefferys, doom'd before, shall now be flea'd By the num'rous Croud, and Monmouth at the Head. These were the noble Acts proclaim'd him Great, At every Hedg-Cabal, and City-Treat. Well he deserves it: Let him be prefer'd The Captain of your Horse, and of your Guard. And he who 'gainst your Life with Knaves conspir'd, Be for your better Angel now admir'd. You once proclaim'd him Traytor! where's the Reason If Traytors meet not the Reward of Treason? What Fondness to a Prodigal lost Fool, Should both your Justice and the Laws o'er-rule? Declare what mighty Wonders he has done, That of a Rebel you adopt a Son. What signal Service has deserv'd this Grace? What Narratives, what Legends ring his Praise? This would to th'astonish'd World make some amends, Tho he declare the contrary to his Friends. You tell of Wonders that he did confess: Tell us what 'tis, we'll pay you in Address. Address upon Address deserves one more, And damn the Plot, and let the Whigs adore. Then honest Men shall be in Plots insnar'd, And Rumbold's Blunderbuss shall be your Guard. You generously told us once before, He was the Son of an anointed Whore. This Truth you once were willing to declare, And will you now exalt him in the Chair? Make him your Son, he'll make himself your Heir. This will record how fit you are to rule, Great, good, wise Charles, out-banter'd by a Fool. And what's become of all the Noise and Pother Of Justice, Conscience, and our dearest Brother; Of all the Loyal Youths his Int'rest own'd, If Heirs must be depos'd, and Rebels crown'd? Augustus Treasons lov'd, and so do you; Will you with Julius hug the Traytor too? Once was he such, pray Heav'n he be'nt so still; Where Mischief's nurs'd to do some glorious Ill, Give him the Pow'r, he'll never want the Will. Sooner expect the Tyger will be tam'd, Than once a Traytor ever be reclaim'd. To be written under the Dutchess of Portsmouth's Picture. Had she but liv'd in Cleopatra's Age, When Beauty did the Earth's great Lord engage; Britain, not Egypt, had been glorious made, Augustus then like Julius had obey'd. A nobler Theme had been this Poet's Boast, That all the World for Love had well been lost. ANSWER. Oh that she'ad liv'd in Cleopatra's Age, And not in ours, to fill us all with Rage! To see Great Britain thus by her betray'd, And Ch???es, who once was great, a Beggar made. Of such a Theme no Poet sure will boast, That would have stole the Pearl that then was lost. ANOTHER. Sure we do live in Cleopatra's Age, Since Sun??land does govern now the Stage. She of Septimius had nothing made, Pompey alone had been by her betray'd. Were she a Poet she would surely boast, That all the World for Pearls had well been lost. SATIRE. Unhappy Island! what hard Fate ordains, That thou should'st change thy Liberty for Chains? Thou who to stubborn Nations once gav'st Law, And kept the jarring World in peaceful Awe; Holding that Ballance in thy steddy Hand, By which the Weaker does the Strong withstand; From Goths and Vandals long in vain set free, And now thy self become a Colony, The Scots and Irish are repriz'd in thee. Starv'd Fugitives scatter'd by Want abroad, Great Travellers for want of an Abode, All meet in Swarms in this unlucky Place, To lead our Armies, and our Counsels grace. While croaking Priests, and greedy Troops devor, The faithful Land with sacrilegious Pow'r. Prevailing Nonsense Reason over-rules, And Providence has giv'n us up to Fools. Fools did th'excluding of a Fool prevent, By a Rebellion Fools have Slav'ry sent, And Fools confirm it still in Parliament. Talbot Supplies of Fools from Ireland sends, And Cl?don's return'd to make amends. The Fav'rite Brother wears th'Almighty Rod, Courted and prais'd by each created Toad, The Sorcerer repines to be a God. Pharaoh and he these Plagues of Egypt bring, And such our Fate must be, while such our King. Conspiring Sun???land still saves the Tide, A Knave most useful to the unjustest Side: And does as fit an Instrument now prove Of lawless Pow'r, as once adulterous Love. The little Chit does scarce deserve Rebuke, That looks behind the Chair as if 'twould puke; Beats time with Politick Head, and all approves, Pleas'd with the Charge of the Queen's Muff and Gloves. Much fam'd in Youth for Poetry and Sense, By Jack Berkeley's early Correspondence. But who can our great Chancellor describe, The noisy Oracle of the Scarlet Tribe? Of James's Instruments the keenest Tool, The hottest, pertest and the boldest Fool: Chose early, by himself design'd for Glory, Since Whig-Law yielded first to conqu'ring Tory: A mortal Enemy to saucy Charters, Now less in fashion than the Book of Martyrs: Than sharp L'Estrange, a more admir'd Prater, Wittier in Bench than he in Observator. O for some skilful Painter now to draw The Western Triumph of avenging Law! When angry Justice with resistless Force, Not like a Stream, but Torrent stopt its Course; Nor poorly bore a single Rebel down, In Shoals the Wretches fell beneath his Frown. Kirk the poor Beast did but for Hunger prey, And only hang'd a Rogue that could not pay: For Luxury the Wolf and Lion kill, And scarce take time to taste the Blood they spill. Now, Fame, thy Trumpet sound, thy Man of War Great Feversham appears with his triumphant Star, To the Clouds bear him in thy airy Chair. Let Oglethorp be pinion'd to his Wing, And as he tells the Tale, so do thou sing His Courage, such as needs not Conduct's Aid, Conduct makes Generals but seem afraid: Therefore he scorns much to be found prepar'd, And sent his Men to rest without a Guard. O but for that unlucky Knock he gat By Block, too sympathetick to his Pate, When he his Brother Craven did aspire To equalize in vain in quenching Fire, Where might not James his Conqu'ring Army lead? But Brains are some want in a General's Head. Now, Muse, let thy just Indignation cease, Touch not the lowsy Vermin after these. When such a Quarry does thy Vigour claim, Scorn to descend to an ignoble Game. Thus while the Huntsman eagerly in view, A foaming Boar or Lion does pursue, Safe to their Holes the Fox and Badger creep, And dare not look abroad, but stink and sleep. Let honest Laureat now, whose pliant Rhymes, With his Religon, wait upon the Times, Rail at the Man who these bold Truths has told, And call him dull Phanatick, Whig and Scold; Franklyn, Lloyd, Sackville, and the meaner Rout Of little Underlings, that sit about, Pretend they know the Author by his Stile: I've eas'd my Mind, and will securely smile. A New Ballad: To the Tune of Trenchmore. 1 What do Members now ail, To the King to turn Tail, Nor in Loyalty more to persevere? With them lies the blame, For he's still the same, And as he is like to be ever. 2 'Tis a kind of gainsaying To Passive Obeying, To be govern'd by your own Senses: The King does no more Than you did before, When with the use of those he dispenses. 3 With a new turn'd Devotion They quit their Promotion; They slighted Laws, now they adore 'em: 'Cause the Test makes 'em swear The Bread is still there, Since they think they see it before 'em. 4 The religiously Wise With the Church should advise, Not with Canterbury, or with Pauls: For no Trick can stir 'em, Since Chester and Durham Are standing Councils for Souls. 5 For Temporal Grudges Repair to the Judges, There's nothing to them a hard Motion: Could they have been scar'd With a Question too hard, Their Lordships had lost their Promotion. 6 But why should John Moor See more than before Strange Scruples, at which he grows troubled? And what does bewitch Our Loyal Sh'riff Rich, By Conscience now to be bubbled? 7 But yet by good hap There's Moses in Gap, Who has compass'd that which may please you: Smart Craven's Address Has found strange success, And the Protestants they shall have ease too: 8 Naval shall be free As Nature should be; There is granted a large Commission, With a full good Intent, It comes beyond Trent From the Generous Inquisition. To Mr. Julian. Julian, in Verse, to ease thy Wants, I write, Not mov'd by Envy, Malice, or by Spite; Or pleas'd with th'empty Names of Wit or Sense, But merely to supply thy want of Pence. This did inspire my Muse, when out at heel, She saw her needy Secretary reel; Griev'd that a Man so useful to the Age, Should foot it in so mean an Equipage. A crying Scandal! that the Fees of Sense, Should not be able to support th'Expence Of a poor Scribe, who never thought of Wants, When able to procure a Cup of Nants. But Dulness sits at Helm, and in this Age Governs our Pulpits, Councils, and the Stage. Here a dull Counsellor ador'd we see; And there a Poet duller yet than he; With beardless Bishop, dullest of the three. 'Tis dangerous to think— For who by thinking tempts his jealous Fate, Is strait arraign'd as Traytor to the State: And none that come within the Verge of Sense, Have to Preferment now the least pretence. Nay Poets, guilty of that Treason prov'd, Are by a general Hiss from Court remov'd. Shakespear himself reviv'd, finds no success, And living Authors sure must hope for less. Since Dullness then finds more success than Wit, This Poem, Julian, cannot chuse but hit. But for thy Profit, Julian, have a care Of prying Poultney, and of Bully Carr: In them there's Danger, for the one does write With the same Prowess, the other us'd to fight. Next florid Huntingdon and civil Grey, Who knew his Grace was gone, but not which way: 'Twere needless here, and tedious too to name All that are envious of poor Poets Fame: Consult thy sacred Volume, and thou'lt find, Some who to Reverend Dulness have been kind: To those obsequious cringe with humble Bow, With Court-like Scrapes, and with submissive Brow; Since from their num'rous Party thou may'st hope, More than Prance, Oates or Bedlow from the Pope. Thirsis has gain'd Preferment by a Song, While Hudibras does starve among the Throng, Nay, minion Shadwell cannot hold out long. There lives a Lord, a Noble Peer is he, Whose Conscience is as pliant as his Knee; Whose easy Temper, by Good-nature mov'd, Does make him universally belov'd. He once pretended to a share of Sense; But for that Insolence and bold Offence, The Council wisely banish'd him from thence. He, finding those Pretences ominous, Is grown at length as dull as one of us. Him make thy Friend, and if that Method fail, Prepare thee in these following Terms to rail. May Hewet's Billets-deux successful prove, In tempting of her little Grace to Love: May Anglesey think Bribery a Sin; His Countess pull it out when it's once put in: May Arlington his little Brat despise, And she no more the Name of Dutchess prize: May puzzling Howard live by Poetry, And Cleaveland die for want of Leachery: May Monmouth quit his Int'rest in the Crown, Mall Howard never grin, and Nelly never frown: May Betty Mackrel cease to be a Whore, And Villain Frank kiss Mazarin no more. To the Tune of Joan Sanderson: The Cushion-Dance at White-Hall by way of Masquerade.— Enter Godfrey Aldworth, follow'd by the King and Duke Hand in Hand. King. The Trick of Trimming is a fine Trick, And shall we go try it once again? Duke. The Plot it will no farther go. King. I pray thee wise Brother, why say you so? Duke. Because the Bastard will not come to. King. He must come to, and he shall come to, And he must come whether he will or no. Enter the Duke of Monmouth out at heels. Chorus. Welcome thou Rebel Son, Welcome, Welcome. The Dance ended. Enter the Duke of Grafton looking wisely, the Duke of Richmond with the Keys of the Muse, his Grace of Albemarle with his Commission, Sidney with his Pardon, they dance the Hay.—Albemarle falls asleep, Richmond gets to's Book, Grafton looks like a Fool, and Sidney lets a Fart. Exeunt Omnes. Satire. Among the Race of England's modern Peers, There's one whose Looks betray his leuder Years; Whom early Nature for all Ill did frame, And time increas'd not faster than his Fame: Unheard-of Vices were his study'd Care, Th' effects of which his rotten Ruins were. His sight's a Terror to the boldest Punk, Who shuns him more than Pembroke when he's drunk. But tho to Pox and Impotence confin'd, His Body's less corrupted than his Mind. Both Politick and Hero he'd be thought, By James's Ruin he has Judgment bought, And Epsom-Hedg can witness how he fought. To a Soul so mean ev'n Shadwell is a Stranger; Nay, little Sid, it seems, less values danger: The most hen-hearted Wretches of the Age, Who ne'er durst give offence, but on the Stage. But on such Trash my time were ill bestow'd; Those Hackney Cowards in the Common Road. The Man, whose Character I would relate, From Infamy defin'd divines his Fate. 'Tis France can tell where he the Broil began, Engag'd his Friend, and then away he ran. This is that worship'd Idol, who with's Pen Detracts the best of Monarchs, best of Men: Whose Libels wholly tend to move Sedition, Like those good Men, who now-a-days petition. Falshood and Knavery his Morals guide, A Stain to Honour, and a Slave to Pride; Yet courts and flatters you in ev'ry place, And all the while designing your Disgrace; The most fantastick of all Fools i'th' Nation, Industrious only to be out of Fashion, Which he affects from tawny A? A?n, That tawdry, impudent, insipid Baron, Who to be Fop Supreme does drudge and labour, And whom on Earth nothing can match but Baber: He of the Two's the more Authentick Ass, As witness his translating Hudibras; And prating still of Poetry and Writing, In which he just succeeds as in his Fighting. But besides these there is another sort, Infects the Coffee-House, as these haunt the Court: A sort of Rascals, in whose tainted Veins The Blood of their rebellious Fathers reigns: And Broods of creeping Rogues of mungrel Races, Whose Principles are fatal as their Faces. Such abject Animals! one would forswear Ev'n witty Men to find such Vermin there: Villains that Faction daily do foment, And practise to defame the Government: Assembling their Cabal, at whose discretion The Royal Line must prostrate the Succession. What Times we live in, when such Beasts as Clud, The Whartons, Jepson, and that Blockhead Wood, The Ashes, Bradbury, and mad Sir John, Blunt, Marshal, St. John, Spicer, Ireton, Merry, and Cuckold Smithsby, Harris, Cope, The Patron of the Faction-burning Pope; Chase, Lower, Negus, Tizard, all the Shrubs, Of Kings head, Dragon, and of Ashley Clubs. When Insects, such as these, from Filth begun, Thy Peace disturb, and slight thy milder Sun; Shine, out great Cæsar, let thy glorious Heat Declare thee pow'rful, as thou'rt truly Great. Disperse those saucy Flies, that tempt thy Flame, At nothing less than thy Destruction aim. To Mon?th, Sh?ry, and Maxfield bring The just Resentments of an injur'd King. Call home thy banish'd Brother, by whose Hand, Being Lord o'th'Sea, thou'rt King again at Land. Let that wrong'd Prince enjoy his antient Right, The Sailor's Genius, and their God in Fight. Then shall the Navy stretch its joyful Wings, While every Muse of Britain's Triumph sings. The French no more shall dare our Ships despise, But Homage pay where-e'er thy Standard flies. All honest Men with Signs of Joy shall greet This prosp'rous Leader, and thy matchless Fleet; Whose happy Conduct shall again restore Those Wreaths of Glory which our Fathers wore. Then Knaves and Plotters shall be publick made, And we no more of Perjuries afraid. The Nations all throughout will then proclaim Th'Injustice done to his Illustrious Name: And thou, great King, rejoice above the rest, With such a Subject, and a Brother blest. The Answer. Among the writing Race of Modern Wits, Blest be his Pen, whoe'er it be, that writ In Numbers soft the Politick Petition, I'th' Name of all the honest Men o'th' Nation. Wishing for Parliaments deserves rebuke, For good Men now a-days wish for the Duke. The first, whose Character I would relate, For want of Wit and Fashion finds his Fate; There's not so false, so infamous a thing, So leud a Wretch in Court, God bless the King. To Pox and Impotence much more confin'd, As gravely politick, and no more refin'd. In's Heart less Honesty, in's Bones more Dryness, Just such another Hero as his Highness. Had this leud Wretch but his deserved Fall, Wit then and Truth might flourish at Whiteball. For Lauderdale's as honest, as well featur'd, As little treacherous as he's ill-natur'd. Mulgrave's a Pattern of Humility, Of sweet Deportment, and of Chivalry. Deep plotting Plymouth is the Nation's Glory, And sprightly Grafton deeply read in Story: Their Wit and pretty Morals speak 'em plain, Sprung from the best of Monarchs, best of Men. Griffin's a dainty thing, would he but dance, And Sun?land's a very Scourge to France. Youthful St. Al?ns, fam'd for Piety, And humble N?port for kind Courtesy. For Stratagems in War, there's Albemarle, Hewet's not fitter for a General. Yet when all's done, there's no Man can compare, For Carriage, Youth, and Beauty, with Sir Carre. But besides these, there is another sort Adorns the Coffee-House, as these grace the Court: A Race of high-born Heroes, in whose Veins The Blood of their illustrious Fathers reigns. There's great Sir George, who never cheats at play, Hates lying much, and scorns to run away; Abhors to flatter, and is shy to lend His healthy Mistress to his wealthy Friend. By his Discourse Lumley gives great Diversion, But he's most famous for his true Conversion. Good-humour'd Sackville, once a Senator, With his Crevat-string keeps but little stir; Has a bewitching Face, and that's a Blessing, For those that have it, need not mind their Dressing. 'Twere labour lost, after these three, to name Honest Frank Newport, and well-shap'd He'ningham, Musician Pack, Fox, Lucy, Hastings, Frazier, Sarah's Charles Deering, faithful Barry's Parker, Matthews and Courtney, by whose Swords and Brains, Our Cæsar wisely and discreetly reigns, Spite of those saucy Flies, who tempt his Flame, Daring their Cares and Liberties to name: Infamous Rascals, by a double Brand, For they all hate the Pope, and some have Land; And Land was ever held the greatest Slander, By gentle Poet, and by small Commander. SATIRE. Since all the Actions of the far-fam'd Men Of Athens, Rome, and Sparta, by the Pen Of learned Plutarch are distinctly known, For which he is unequal'd in Renown: Why may not I, by his Success inspir'd, Tread in his Steps, and be as much admir'd? My Heroes are unquestionably brave, Have Valour to o'ercome, and Mercy have to save. For Birth and Quality they yield to none, Should they from Jove descend to fill a Throne: For who is ignorant throughout the Land Of famous Bedloe, or the more fam'd Southerland? The antient Britain's proud to own the one, And fertile Scotland from the frozen Zone, Proclaims she's prouder of her Hero's Birth, Than were she Mistress of the whole known Earth. These Heroes both did for the Wars prepare, In France and Flanders both reap'd equal Share Of Glory and Renown.— But hold! before my Muse leads me too far, I of their Education must declare. They are alike in the Laconick Law, Hardly bred up to Want, and lie in Straw: These hopeful Youths their Breeding underwent With Constancy, and fasted with Content; But as in Sparta, by Lycurgus' Rule, The Youths had nought to eat but what they stole, And who was caught was punish'd for the Fool: So they in unknown Paths their Lives did lead, And for their bare Subsistence stole their Bread. In equal Ballance yet hung their Renown, But now the British Hero I must own; Must vail his Bonnet to the nobler Scot, And in a A Prison. Naskin mourn his fatal Lot. While Industry and want of Clothes conspir'd, To make our Northern Hero more admir'd. Whate'er he undertook, prov'd fortunate, He often stole, but never yet was caught. With Art he'd lift a Shop, could file a Cly, Or give a Coach the Ambiguity. And that his Vertues you may throughly know, By what unpractis'd Ways he stole, and how; Upon the lofty Walls of Lincolns-Inn, Coming from Holbourn, I have often seen A Tongs, which closely lay at the Command Of this our Hero's most unerring Hand: And when a flutt'ring Spark did walk that way, It did its Master tenderly obey, And snapt the Hat and Perriwig for a Prey. Or when a gentle Cully he did spy, Equip me with a George, he strait wou'd cry, Or d?mee, Sir, I'll clap you thro the Thigh. Thus with a thousand ways that I could name, By which he earn'd his Bread, and purchas'd Fame, He does at last most splendidly resort Unto his proper Sphere, the glorious Court; Where without Envy at the Helm he'll sit, Advanc'd as much for's Beauty, as his Wit: Yet can't forget his old delightful way, But must cry,—Jack, what have you stole to-day? A Letter from the Duke of M?th to the King. The attribution of this poem is questionable. Disgrac'd, undone, forlorn, made Fortune's Sport, Banish'd your Kingdom first, and then your Court; Out of my Places turn'd, and out of Doors, And made the meanest of your Sons of Whores; The Scene of Laughter, and the common Chats Of your salt Bitches, and your other Brats; Forc'd to a private Life, to whore and drink, On my past Grandeur, and my Follies think. Would I had been the Brat of some mean Drab, Whom Fear or Chance had caus'd to choke or stab, Rather than be the Issue of a King, And by him made so wretched, scorn'd a thing. How little cause has Mankind to be proud Of noble Birth, the Idol of the Croud? Have I abroad in Battels Honour won, To be at home dishonourably undone? Mark'd with a Star and Garter, and made fine With all those gaudy Trifles, once call'd mine; Your Hobby-Horses, and your Joys of State; And now become the Object of your Hate: But, d?mee, Sir, I'll be legitimate. I was your Darling, but against your Will; And know that I will be the People's still. And when you're dead, I and my Friends the Rout, Will with my Popish Uncle try a Bout; And to my Troubles this one Comfort bring, Next after you, by ?, I will be King. The King's Answer. Ungrateful Boy! I will not call thee Son, Thou hast thy self unhappily undone; And thy Complaints serve but to show thee more, How much thou hast inrag'd thy Father's Whore. Resent it not, shake not thy addle Head, And be no more by Clubs and Rascals led. Have I made thee the Darling of my Joys, The prettiest and the lustiest of my Boys? Have I so oft sent thee with Cost to France, To take new Dresses up, and learn to dance? Have I giv'n thee a Ribbon and a Star, And sent thee like a Meteor to the War? Have I done all that Royal Dad could do, And do you threaten now to be untrue? But say I did with thy fond Mother sport, To the same Kindness others had resort; 'Twas my Good-nature, and I meant her Fame, To shelter thee under my Royal Name. Alas! I never got one Brat alone, My Mistresses are by each Fop well known, And I still willing all their Brats to own. I made thee once, 'tis true, the Post of Grace, And stuck upon thee every mighty Place, Each glitt'ring Office, till thy heavy Brow Grew dull with Honour, and my Power low. I spangled thee with Favours, hung thy Nose With Rings of Gold and Pearl, till all grew Foes By secret Envy at thy growing State, I lost my Safety when I made thee Great. There's not the least Injustice to you shewn, You must be ruin'd to secure my Throne. Office is but a fickle Grace, the Badg Bestow'd by Fits, and snatch'd away in Rage; And sure that Livery which I give my Slaves, I may take from them when my Portsmouth raves. Thou art a Creature of my own Creation, Then swallow this without Capitulation. If you with feigned Wrongs still keep a clutter, And make the People for your sake to mutter, For my own Comfort, but your Trouble know, G?fish, I'll send you to the Shades below. The Ghost of honest Tom Ross, to his Pupil the Duke of M???mouth. Shame of my Life! Disturber of my Tomb! Base from thy Mother's prostituted Womb! Huffing to Cowards, fawning to the Brave, To Knaves a Fool, to credulous Fools a Knave, The King's Betrayer, and the popular Slave. Like Samuel, at the Negromantick Call, I rise to tell thee, God has left thee, Saul. I strive in vain thy infected Blood to cure, Streams will run muddy when the Spring's impure. In all your prosp'rous Life we plainly see Old Taff's invincible Sobriety. The Place of Master of the Horse, and Spy, You, like Tom Howard, did at once supply. From Sydney's Blood your Loyalty did spring, You shew us all your Fathers, but the King; From whose too tender, and too bounteous Arms, (Unhappy he whom such a Viper warms) As dutiful a Subject as a Son, To your true Parents, the whole Town, you run. Read, if you can, how th'old Apostate fell, Out-do his Pride, and merit more than Hell: Both he and you were gloriously bright, The first and fairest of the Sons of Light. But when, like you, he offer'd at the Crown, Like him, your angry Father kick'd you down. A Poem on the Bishops throwing out the Bill of Exclusion. The grave House of Commons, by hook or by crook, Resolv'd to root out the Pope and the Duke; Let them vote, let them move, let them do what they will, The Bishops, the Bishops have thrown out the Bill. There was Hereford, Winnington, Hamden and Birch, Did verily think to establish the Church: But now they do find it's past all their Skill, For the Bishops, the Bishops have thrown out the Bill. Sir William endeavour'd, as much as he could, To shew that the Bill was for the Duke's Good, For that disinherits the Man we would kill, The Bishops, &amp;c. Paul Wharton that stood behind Sir Richard Cary, To confront, as he thought, the Plenipotentiary; Little thought, when he rudely had bawl'd out his fill, That the Bishops, &amp;c. There is little Reason the dull six and twenty Should oppose the whole Nemine Contradicente, And what they bring forth in its Infancy kill; For the Bishops, &amp;c. The wise Earl of Shaftsbury, Monmouth, and Grey, Lord Essex, Lord Howard, Lords Et cætera, Tho they have drawn in the Lord Privy Seal, Yet the Bishops, &amp;c. Old Rowley was there to sollicite the Cause, Against his own Life, the Church, and the Laws; Yet he might have liv'd safely against his own Will, Had the Bishops, the Bps, not thrown out the Bill. His Highness for fear to Scotland is gone, The Cov'nant to take, and be crown'd at Scoon; But now he may e'en come home if he will, For the Bishops, &amp;c. Had he known this before, or some of the Gang, He had sav'd his Guineas to Sir John Whitwang, And might at St. James's have plotted, his fill; For the Bishops, &amp;c. Had not Bishops been suffer'd in the House for to sit, He had been like his Grandfather Jemmy beshit; But now he's as safe as a Thief in a Mill, For the Bishops, &amp;c. The best of Expedients the Law can propose, Our Church to preserve, and quiet our Foes, Is not to let Lawn-sleeves our Parliament fill, But throw out the Bishops that threw out the Bill. A Familiar Epistle to Mr. Julian, Secretary to the Muses. Thou common-shore of this Poetick Town, Where all our Excrements of Wit are thrown: For Sonnet, Satire, Baudry, Blasphemy, Are empty'd and disburden'd all on thee. The cholerick Wight untrussing in a Rage, Finds thee, and leaves his Load upon thy Page. Thou Julian! O thou wise Vespasian rather, Dost from this Dung thy well-pick'd Guineas gather. All Mischief's thine; transcribing thou wilt stoop From lofty Middlesex to lowly Scroop. What times are these? when in that Hero's room Bow-bending Cupid does with Ballads come, And little Aston offers to the B?. Can two such Pygmies such a Weight support? Two such Tom-Thumbs of Satire in a Court? Poor George grows old, his Muse worn out of fashion, Hoarsly she sings Ephelia's Lamentation. Less art thou help'd from Dryden's Bed-rid Age, That Drone has left his Sting upon the Stage. Resolve me, poor Apostate, this main Doubt; What hope hast thou to rub this Winter out? Know and be thankful then, for Providence By me has sent thee this Intelligence. A Knight there is, if thou can'st gain his Grace, Known by the Name of the hard-favour'd Face; For Prowess of his Pen renown'd is he, From Don Quixote descended lineally: And tho, like him, unfortunate he prove, Undaunted in Attempts of Wit and Love; Of his unfinish'd Face what shall I say, But that 'twas made of Adam's own red Clay? That much, much Ocre was on it bestow'd, God's Image 'tis not, but some Indian God. Our Christian Earth can no Resemblance bring But Ware of Portugal for such a thing: Such Carbuncles his fiery Cheeks confess, As no Hungarian Water can redress. A Face, which could he see (but Heav'n was kind, And to indulge his Self-love made him blind) He durst not stir abroad for fear to meet Curses of teeming Women in the Street. The best could happen from that hideous Sight, Is that they should miscarry with the Fright, Heav'n guard 'em from the Likeness of the Knight. Such is our charming Strephon's outward Man, His inward Parts let those describe who can: But by his Monthly Flow'rs discharg'd abroad; 'Tis full, brim full of Pastoral and Ode. One while he honour'd Birtha with his Flame, And now he chaunts no less Lovisa's Name: For when his Passion has been bubbling long, The Scum at last boils up into a Song. And sure no mortal Creature at one time Was e'er so far begon with Love and Rhyme. To his dear self of Poetry he talks, His Hand and Feet are scanning as he walks: His squeezing Looks, his Pangs of Wit accuse, The very Symptoms of a breeding Muse; And all to gain the great Lovisa Grace, But never Pen did pimp for such a Face. There's not a Nymph in City, Town, or Court, But Strephon's Billet-deux have been her Sport. Still he loves on, yet still as sure to miss As he that was an Æthiop's Face or his. What Fate unhappy Strephon does attend, Never to get a Mistress or a Friend? Strephon both Wits and Fools alike detest, Because, like Æsop's Bat, half Bird, half Beast: For Fools to Poetry have no Pretence, And common Wit supposes common Sense. Not quite so low as Fool, nor quite a top, He hangs between them both, and is a Fop. His Morals, like his Wit, are motley too, He keeps from arrant Knave with much ado; But Vanity and Lying so prevail, That one Grain more of each would turn the Scale. He would be more a Villain had he time, But he's so wholly taken up with Rhyme, That he mistakes his Talent: All his Care Is to be thought a Poet fine and fair. Small-Beer and Grewel are his Meat and Drink, The Diet he prescribes himself to think. Rhyme next his Heart he takes at Morning-peep, Some Love-Epistle at the hour of Sleep: So between Elegy and Ode we see, Strephon is in a Course of Poetry. This is the Man ordain'd to do thee good, The Pelican to feed thee with his Blood. Thy Wit, thy Poet, nay, thy Friend; for he Is fit to be a Friend to none but thee. Make sure of him, and of his Muse betimes, For all his Study is hung round with Rhymes. Laugh at him, justle him, yet still he writes, In Rhyme he challenges, in Rhyme he fights. Charg'd with the last and basest Infamy, His Bus'ness is to think what rhymes to Lee: Which found, in Fury he retorts again, Strephon's a very Dragon at his Pen. His Brother's murder'd, and his Mother whor'd, His Mistress lost, and yet his Pen's his Sword. The Statesman's Almanack. Being an excellent new Ballad, in which the Qualities of each Month are consider'd; whereby it appears that a Parliament cannot meet in any of the old Months: With a Proposal for mending the Calendar, humbly offer'd to the Packers of the next Parliament. To the Tune of, Cold and Raw the Wind did blow. 1 The Talk up and down In Country and Town Has been long of a Parliament's sitting; But we'll make it clear, Ne'er a Month in the Year Is proper for such a Meeting. 2 The Judges declare it, The Ministers swear it, But the Town as a Tale receives it; Let them say what they can, There is ne'er a Man, Except God's Vicegerent believes it. 3 If the Criticks in spite, Our Arguments slight, And think them too light for the Matter; It has been often known, That Men on a Throne Have arraign'd the whole Realm with no better. 4 For in times of old, When Kings were less bold, And made for their Faults some Excuses; Such Topicks as these, The Commons to please, Did serve for most excellent Uses. 5 Either Christmas comes on, Or Harvest's begun, And all must repair to their Station; 'Twas too dry or too wet For the Houses to set, And Hey for a Prorogation. 6 Then, Sir, if you please, With such Reasons as these, Let's see how each Moon's appointed: For sure it most strange is, That in all her Changes, She favours not God's Anointed. January. The first is too cold For Popery to hold, Since Southern Climes do improve it: And therefore in Frost 'Tis odds but it's lost, If they offer for to remove it. February. The next does betide, Tho then the King died, Ill-luck, and they must not be tamp'ring: For hadn't Providence quick Cool'd his Head in the nick, 'Fore Gad they were all a scamp'ring. March. The Month of old Rome Has an Omen with some; But the sleeping Wind then knows, And trusts not the Croud When Storms are so loud, Lest th'Air infects the House. April. In this by mishap Southesk had a Clap, Which pepper'd our Gracious Master: And therefore in Spring He must physick his Thing, And venture no new Disaster. May. This Month is too good, And too lusty his Blood To be for business at leisure: With his Confessor's leave Honest Bridget may give The Fumbler Royal his Pleasure. June. The Brains of the State Have been hot of late, They have manag'd all business in Rapture: And to call Us in June Is to the same Tune, To be mad to the end of the Chapter. July. This Season was made For the Camp and Parade, When with the Expence of his Treasure, With much Sweat and Pains Discreetly he trains Such Men as will break all his Measures. August. This Month did advance Their Projects in France, As Bartholomew remembers; But alas they want Force To take the same Course With our Heretical Members. September. They cannot now meet, For the Progress was set, And they find it a scurvy Fashion, To ride, and to ride, To be snub'd and deny'd By ev'ry good Man in the Nation. October. Now Hunting comes in, That Licence to sin, That does with a Cloak befriend him: But if the Queen knows How at Graham's he blows, His Divine Right cannot defend him. November. November might do, For ought that we know, But that the King promis'd by Chancellor: And his Word before Was pawn'd for much more Than e'er 'twill be able to answer. December. The last of the Year Resemblance does bear To their Hopes and their Fortune declining: Ne'er hope for Success, Day grows less and less, And the Sun once so high has done shining. EPILOGUE. Ye Gypsies of Rome That run up and down, And with Miracles the People cozen; By the help of some Saint Get the Month which you want, And make up a Baker's Dozen. You see the old Year Won't help you, 'tis clear: And therefore to save your Honour, Get a new Sun and Moon, And the Work may be done, And 'fore George it will never be sooner. The Dissolution. O Heav'ns! we now have Signs below, To let us our Destruction know: Eclipses, bearded Stars that range, Are needless to presage our Change. When Monarch frowns upon the Wise, And glibly swallows Romish Lyes: When Demonstration can't convince A deaf and unbelieving Prince: When King, by evil Counsel led, Crushes the Trunk to rear the Head; And does the Members fiercely sever, To make 'em calmly come together: When Popery at Helm shall ride, And Ignorance our Counsels guide: When compounded of Ambition, And the Wrath of Inquisition; Whom by the Heat of Heart and Tongue, You'd guess a Lump of Pigeons Dung; And by fierce Deeds rash and amiss, You'd think his Blood the Spirit of Piss: When he, the stubborn Charioteer, Takes his full uncheck'd Carier; While Brother, thoughtless of his Crown, Upon soft Carcase lays him down; When he's Postilion to the Throne, And on the Royal Lumber drives, Protestants, defend your Lives. What can the Issue of this be, But loss of Subjects Liberty? When Presidents of Church and Steeple, Vote for the Treasurer 'gainst the People: And Holy Church, that should not favour Of Carnal Fear, or Princes Favour, Basely complies with Popish Leven, Against their Consciences and Heaven: O, worst of Fates! on our side, The Clergy now from State divide. When Crown-Revenues by Bribes are wasted, And on vile Pensioners exhausted; When honest Men receive Disgrace, Turn'd out of Office, and of Place, And Pow'r beckons from the Throne, To let the Nation stand alone; Thinks of new Ways for new Supplies, And damns the Parliament as Spies: Prorogues, and then dissolves their Heats, And gives no time to try Court-Cheats: What can we think of these Delusions, But Loss of Safety, and Confusions? When King to Commons makes fine Speeches, And draws his Reasons from his Breeches: When Whores make Monarchs drunk, and rule By th'idle Grants of a dipp'd Fool: And Dissolution may be said Th' Effect of Staggers in the Head; And Government is a Disease, Made up of Vice and sensual Ease: When Bestial King, to's Heart's Content, Sucks Bourdeaux from the Fundament: When Cavalier in publick, wars Against the bubbled Governors, And swears, he'll not Assistance bring To a lascivious lazy King, Whom Whores to various Minds do draw, Ruling by Leachery, not Law; Who does his Pimps, not Statesmen trust, Spending his Brains upon his Lust: When things are thus perversly sowing, Poor Ninive is surely going. When French runs thro the Prince's Veins, And he by theirs, not our Laws reigns: When French creeps into Royal Bed, First charming Codpiece, then the Head: When Female Buttocks dictate thus, Good Lord! what will become of us? Is there no end of Monarch's Itch, That lolls upon a fulsom Bitch? And swears upon her nasty Skin, He'll let the Mass and French Troops in; Assigns his Crown and Regal Pow'r To be dispos'd of by a Whore. Beware, unthinking Ch????es, beware, Consider, and begin to fear: For Pope and Lewis are untrue, Whatever James declares to you. He's warranted by Holy Mother, To sham and gull his elder Brother. When he's to work you to design, At first he'll soak you well with Wine: And then to your incestuous Eyes He'll shew again her Highness' Thighs; She may expose on Church-Occasion, Her Popish A? to the whole Nation. Zeal wipes away all Impudence, And greater Crimes are Innocence; When for the Church's Good intended, And thus her Highness' Faults are mended, And Catholick Modesty befriended. This was a good Attempt at first, Shews she ne'er bashfully was nurst; But either liv'd 'mong Shamble-Crews, Brought up in some Italian Stews, A Dutchess in our Country known, A common Strumpet in her own. From Dukes that are but little better, From a Whore by Nation and by Nature, From Kings that reign by their Direction, And Subjects guide by Devil's Protection, From a sous'd Pilot at the Helm, Good Lord deliver this poor Realm. An Ironical Encomium on the unparallel'd Proceedings of the Incomparable Couple of Whiggish Walloons. Go on brave Heroes, you whose Merits claim Eternal Plaudit from the Trump of Fame, Beyond the daring Hector that aspir'd To leave a Name, when he the Temple fir'd, For after Ages; and let nothing pall Your well-fix'd Resolutions; not tho all The Seas were heap'd on Seas, and Hills on Hills: Small are secur'd by doing greater Ills. Go on, and may your tow'ring Deeds outshine The high Atchievements of blest Catiline. And let the Echoes of your Acts by all Be heard as loud as those were at Guildhall. What shall a puny Patriot baulk your Flight, And formal Fops your dawning Days benight? Shall Laws confine, or Lawyers you withstand, That have both Law and Lawyers in your hand? Shall gilded Chains beshackle you with Fears? Tear, tear their Gowns and Chains from off their Ears, And hang their Worships in them: let the Curs Be swing'd in Scarlet, and go rot in Furs. Damn 'em for Dogs to put such Worthies by, Just i'th nick of our Tranquillity; Just as the Saints with forty thousand Men Were furnish'd for a Holy War again. Rally once more, and cry them in the Croud, The Mobile's your own; give out aloud For Reformation, and the Town's your own, Else Liberty and Property are gone. Cæsar's abroad, go seize the Senate, do; And if he comes, faith seize brave Cæsar too. Let nothing be too sacred for your Arms, (Love and Revenge are never fill'd by Charms:) By greatest Acts your greatest Glory gather, And he's no more Immortal than his Father. Serve him as Brutus did, and in his room Put up young Perkin, now the time is come That Ten may chase a Thousand; now or never, Lose but this time, and you are lost for ever. A Deed more bold than Blood's, more brave than them That slily sneak'd to steal a Diadem: For sure that Soul deserves much more Renown, That kills a King, than he that takes his Crown. The Ides of March are past, and Gadbury Proclaims a Downfal of our Monarchy; Who saw the last Conjunction did portend, That Crowns and Kingdoms tumble to their End. A Commonwealth shall rise and splendid grow, As now predicted by the wise T. ?O. Who can foretel, forestal, forswear, foresee, Thro an Inch-Board, or thro an Oaken Tree; Whose Opticks o'er the mighty Main have gone, And brought Destruction on the Great Don John. Titus, whose Skill in Swearing doth excel The monstrous Monarch Radamanth of Hell, And sent more Souls to their untimely Grave, Than the destroying Angels lately have: A walking Plague, a breathing Pestilence, A Cockatrice that kills a Mile from thence. Go on, brave Sirs, the gaping Crouds attend, They watch the Word, the Saints their Thimbles send. The Cushion's cuff'd, the Trumpet sounds to War, Our dying Hopes in you revived are; The People's Choice, with you they'll live and die, The Guardian Angels of their Sanctuary. The Groans are grievous, and the Hawks and Hums, And Pulpits rattle too like Kettle-drums. The Sisters snivel, and their Bodkins melt; They're grop'd in Darkness, and in Pleasure felt. More than in Pharaoh's time the Souls are sick, And cry for Light; alas, the Candlestick Is quite remov'd: Oh! they're lost, they're gone, They see that Whore, the Baud of Babylon, Is just approaching! Oh! the Popish Jade Will tear away their Teachers, and their Trade! Call a Cabal for Resolution hearty, The blessed Brethren of the sober Party. Let Segla's Ghost inform you in the Fact, Rouze him to Earth; and in this glorious Act Consult with Pluto, let old Noll ascend, And if't be possible the new made Friend. Our much-miss'd Oracle let Owen know, The Devil's here as well as those below; And speed for Bethel, bid him not defer, Tell him we want an Executioner: For Royal Blood's in chase, and none but he To act the Villain in a Tragedy. The Rogue will leap for Joy, such News admire, The Son's as sweet as was his sacred Sire; For he's a raving Nimrod will not start To bathe his Hands in such a Royal Heart. The Assembly of the Moderate Divines. 1 Pray pardon John Bays, for I beg your Excuse, If I make no Stranger of your belov'd Muse, It being your Talent Divines to abuse. 2 Divines that can scruple and cant with the Times, As Settle and Shadwel for Bread belch their Rhymes; But St. Peter and St. Judas you know had their Crimes. 3 If amongst twelve Apostles we can produce two Did exceed any cruel and hard-hearted Jew, Why then should we wonder that we have a few? 4 There's the Bishop of Bugdon, for Lincoln he ne'er saw; And there's naked Truth with his scrupulous Paw, And London pray beware of the Common Law. 5 There's the D?n of St. Paul's admir'd by some For his Works against England, Geneva and Rome, Idolatry, Separation, Irenicum. 6 There's a moderate Dean too that talks much of Love, As if a Fanatick was as meek as a Dove; But for him and Ralph Cudworth, a G? let them prove. 7 But B?net, where art thou, thou Man of the Lord! For Mary Hill's loss you may take the Plank's word; For betwixt you and I 'twas a Prophetick Board. 8 With you Anthony Horneck the Pulpit disgraces, With your whining, your sour and tub-like Faces; But the Rolls and the Savoy are privileg'd Places. 9 Saint Laurence for Whichcot does stifly dispute; Perhaps he might cant well if he was not mute: But he preaches as Marr-All does play on the Lute. 10 There's a moderate Doctor of Cornhill St. Miles, Whom the Clergy's Contemner per Slip-stocking stiles; He's an eloquent Preacher, none hears him but smiles. 11 And there's Boanerges his Brother that thunders, He cants in Old Fish-street, and who I pray wonders? For he has an excellent Voice to cry Flounders. 12 There's old Father Gifford in St. Dunstan's i'th' East, Who among the rude Vulgar's a Prophet at least; But whoe'er preach'd well when the People were pleas'd? 13 There's a Reverend Doctor at Cr?gate dwells, Who Sm?thy his Curate in trimming excels; But Bunyan the Quaker has tickled his Gills. 14 There's Pain of White-Chappel, a Simoniack they say, A Man that's cut out to be Vicar of Bray, If the Times do but change, as he wishes they may. 15 There's Hospital Patrick, a Captain they call him, For burlesquing the Psalms some highly extol him, But Oh! L'Estrange and Sam's Coffee-house gall him. 16 There's one Squire Ramsey, a famous Divine, Who no less than ten Women did love at one time; But it might be call'd Lust in any but him. 17 There's Johnson th'Apostate, who deserves to be hemp'd, For he alone (were all others exempt) Were occasion enough for the Clergy's Contempt. 18 There's Colchester Hickeringil, the Fanaticks Delight, Who Gregory Gray-Beard and Meroz did write: You may see who are Saints in a Pharisee's sight. 19 There's Titus the Witness, the Nation's trite Theme, Who for Satan and Hell hath so great an Esteem, That Damnation would be a Preferment to him. 20 There's Geering of Southwark, and Lewis o'th' Wall, The one hath a Sacrament at a Whig's Call; For he made his Saviour St. John's Jackall. 21 There's B?B. there's Aldgate paid; There's Messieurs Raggous wears no Shirt, as 'tis said, Because they resemble a Surplice indeed. 22 But Kid?r, thy trimming above human Race, For Faction turn'd out of the Rolls with Disgrace, And Orthodox B?net succeeds in thy Place. 23 There's Scotch bawling Anderson proof against Pen, Has a Voice that drowns a Cathedral Amen; But 'tis thought he catches more Women than Men. 24 There's Durham of Bread-street has trim'd fifty years, So old, so grave, so foolish appears, At once he deserves both Laughter and Tears. 25 But Trimming's the Subject of brave Roger's Pen, Who scourges these Monsters call'd moderate Men; For Trimming the Scourge of Rebellion has been. 26 But who all Divinity-Trimmers can tell, Who ev'ry where teach, and no where do dwell? I hate Knaves in it, but I love the Gown well. On Wi. Williams. Williams, this tame Submission sutes thee more Than the mean Payment of thy Fine before. Poor Wretch! who after taking down thy Arms, Has a Court-smile such over-ruling Charms? Bankrupt in Honour, now art tumbled down Below the abject'st Creature of a Crown. Is this the Man the wiser World did wait on, Unworthy now the very Spew of Payton? What will Sir Trevor Williams, Barnardiston, And Arnold say, but that he should be piss'd on? Is this Wi. Williams who made such a noise, Dreadful to all the leud abhorring Boys? Is this Wi. Williams, Spark of Resolution, Who was so fierce for Bill of damn'd Exclusion? Is this Wi. Williams, spoke the thing so strange; Great Sir, your Commons are not given to change? Is this Wi. Williams now at last set right? Is't so: Then Drawer light me down to sh?. On my Lord Lin??????n's Brother turning Roman Catholick. From the Embraces of a Harlot flown, The Heavens have brought you to your native Home. Now your once faded Laurels bloom again; Thus Phœbus rises from the weeping Main. That Guardian Angel wandring Israel fled, With happy Care has blest your glorious Head. Safe from th'involving Gulph you now may view The falling Precipice that threaten'd you. Religion's Truth will all your Care remove; Your happy self protected from above, Not by a Saint, or an intreating she, But by the sole, the blest Divinity. Vainly let those their num'rous Converts boast; What they have got we wholly fancy lost. Shining in Glory, and in number few; We are the slighted Asians, but the true. In you alone our Triumphs greater be, You ballance all the number'd Progeny. Legion their Name, Legion their Nature too: The Truth can never yield, altho it bow. See tho what Chaplets all our Nymphs prepare To grace your Head, and to adorn your Hair. Laurels immortal, and reviving Bay, The perfect Emblem of your chosen way, Shall crown the Virgin Beauties on their Brow; This pious Gratitude and Heaven allow: So Mecca's Saint rose proudly from a Slave; So smooth Religion led the Victor Knave. From pious Weeds to virtuous Arms decreed, Tho Monkish Pride impose on Monkish Breed: He gain'd the specious Phantom of a Throne, And Blood and Murder did his Temples crown. Prevent the Omen, be the Finis good, 'Tis a dark Bog, and darkly understood. Sweet Looks are plac'd, and the deceiving Brow, Crocodiles smile, and smiling murder too. The Doctor libel'd, 'tis a meer Lampoon; Can Father Hall mate Father Tillotson? Ken speaks, the World his Eloquence must prize, 'Tis School-Boy's Logick echoes Prejudice. He talks against the Antichristian Pope; Thus Paul, tho beaten, unresisted spoke: A Bishop he, and such may still remain, Unenvy'd by the Darling of the Crown: Let his dull miter'd Crosier vainly boast, Van-Leader of th'Apostatizing Host. This let him, nay and is there more, enjoy, They well deserve such Passive Joys to try, Who likely pay so dearly for't as he. 'Twas Interest the false Apostle sway'd, How well his End his Int'rest obey'd? No Prophet I, tho here we all accord, Their Souls may well be fear'd, they fly their Lord. Hence ye dull Earth, the Scandal to our Cause, Go sink your Souls as you have damn'd the Laws, Play with the Snakes that harbour in your Breast, And when they bite, pray let them be at rest. And since you play so much with Destiny, Hear me, I'll wish, tho calmly, e'er I die; May that false Pen, that did the Nonsense write, May that false Tongue, that did the Lines indite, Be damn'd, till those who do the Shams admire, Shall curse the Writers, and deplore the Fire. On Sir Will. Jones, an Epitaph. Sir William in Arcta custodia lies, Committed by Death Sans Bail or Mainprize, Forsaking his King, a very good Client, He turn'd Jack Presbyter, O fie on't! And being thus from his Allegiance free, Returned was by him for Anarchy. A Gem call'd the Law in his Head there lay, So Toads hold Pearls in Capite they say: And stor'd he was with Poison like those Creatures, Which made him swell so big against his Betters. His Eyes so full were with Infection fill'd, Loyalty seem'd a Statute-Law repeal'd: He stuck close on the Republick side, And having spit his Venom out, he dy'd. On the E. of D???by's Impeachment by the House of Commons, 1678. What a Devil ails the Parliament? Sure they were drunk with Brandy, When they did seek to circumvent Thomas Earl of D?by. But they ungrateful will appear, As any thing that can be; For they received Fidler's Fare From Thomas Earl of D?by. But Shaftsbury does lie and lurk, That little Jack-a-Dandy, And all his Engines set on work 'Gainst Thomas Earl of D?by. Now whether he will stay or go, I think it handy-dandy; If he dare stay, he'll hang I trow Poor Thomas Earl of D?by. I never heard of Subject tell, Nor can one in this Land be, Deserves a Halter half so well As Thomas Earl of D?by. Then Commons trust him not a bit, Unless you will trapan'd be; There's not so false a Jesuit As Thomas Earl of D?by. Truth brought to Light: Or, Murder will out. By S. College. Would the World know how Godfrey lost his Breath? This tells the Tragick Story of his Death: Not borrow'd from the feigned Ghost appearing Unto us Mortals, so the Story clearing; Or taken from the Narrative of Prance, Where he too modest does on Persons glance; Tho there's enough for all with half an Eye To scan some Villains in this Tragedy. An Oedipus there needs not to explain The wretched Norfolk's House in Clements-Dane: Or how the Owner Godfrey did persuade To eat his last, and basely him betray'd. Hear but the Villain how he did ensnare This gen'rous Soul into his bloody Fare. Pray, good Sir Edmund, stay, I beg the Boon Of some Discourse with you this Afternoon, In a Rehearsal of this Hellish Plot, Which you by Oates's Depositions got; You shall oblige me ever, and you will Preserve our King and Kingdom from their Ill. Tho of the Church of Rome you know I am, I would be thought a Loyal English Man: For if their damned Plot be as I hear, I'll curse the Pope, and leave their Church I swear. And as to what you plead as your Excuse, You have some Friends at home you shall abuse By your long stay, I will a Footman send, That shall acquaint your Servants and your Friend, You have some Bus'ness that detains you here; And therefore they must not expect you there. Thus by a Syren's Tongue and Popish Guile, He did persuade his stay, and sent mean while Unto his Ban-dogs, that they might way-lay him As home he went, and barb'rously slay him. Lo! here's the Project of a Popish Peer, To murder Men in Love by Lordly Cheer: From which, till known, the Wise have no defence, Nor can escape Rome's treacherous Pretence. The best of Men by wretched means they kill, To serve their Church, and gain their cursed Will. Say but Rome's Vicar, Such a Man must die, That's Crime enough, no matter how or why. His Hounds of Blood and cruel Beasts of Prey, Who call it Merit to deceive, betray, Murder whole Nations standing in their way. So fell the Noble Godfrey by the hand Of D's, E's, Ld's, and Q's of Royal Band, Whose direful Dirge they sung in Northern Tone, Where York and Norfolk kept the time as one: And treach'rous Tom made England's Treasure pay Rewards to those that did his Life betray. That Osb???n Villain, raised by his skill Of pimping, and procuring to our Will; The worst of Slaves, that so he might be great, Expos'd his Wife and Daughters to our Heat. Ah! blessed Tool at our most gracious need, That never fail'd us so to do the deed! Next sail'd the Portsmouth Frigat with the Elves, And as is said, is steered by our selves; Blown by the blast of Bellas—curs'd Spleen; And yet it seems was Musick for a Queen; And so delighted England's harmless Chip, That made her dance, and 'bout the dead to skip In Masquerade, by Faux his Lanthorn drest, Where her dear Priests the holy Murder blest. Prejudg'd by them they this Conclusion draw, A Ducal Dinner's Death by Martial Law. By these Rome's Vassals did in order get, That Godfrey's Life might have a Somerset, And die for daring to inspect the things Of Mother-Church, of holy Pope and Kings; And the Retinue, Banditti of Hell, Welch Powis, Peters, Stafford, Arundel, And thousands more of that accursed Brood, Who would convert us by a Sea of Blood, And turn the Laws of England out of doors, By Standing-Army, Pensioners and Whores, Bastards sans number, at the Nation's Charge, For whom we have been taxed oft at large; And made to buy our Ruin with our Coin, Which went for Votes, and Plots, and Countermine. Alas! poor Nation, how art thou undone By a bad Father, and now a worse, his Son! What have these Cubs of Scotland brought upon us? There's nothing left but Lord have Mercy on us! Justice in Masquerade: Or Scroggs upon Scroggs. A Butcher's Son's Judg Capital Poor Protestants for to enthral, And England to enslave, Sirs: Lose both our Laws and Lives we must, When to do Justice we entrust So known an errant Knave, Sirs. Some hungry Priests he did once fell With mighty Strokes, and them to Hell Sent presently away, Sirs. Would you know why? the Reason's plain, They had no English nor French Coin To make a longer stay, Sirs. The Pope to Purgatory sends Who neither Mony have nor Friends; In this he's not alone, Sirs. For our Judg to Mercy's not inclin'd, 'Less Gold change Conscience and his Mind, You are infallibly gone, Sirs. His Father once exempted was Out of all Juries: Why? because He was a Man of Blood, Sirs. And why the Butcherly Son (forsooth) Shou'd now be Jury and Judg both, Cannot be understood, Sirs. The good old Man with Knife and Knocks Made harmless Sheep and stubborn Ox Stoop to him in his Fury. But the brib'd Son, like greasy Oaph, Kneels down and worships Golden Calf, And so does all the Jury. Better thou'dst been at Father's Trade, An honest Livelihood to have made In hamp'ring Bulls with Collars, Than to thy Country prove unjust, First sell, and then betray thy Trust For so many hard Rix-Dollars. Priest and Physician thou didst save From Gallows, Fire, and from the Grave, For which we can't endure thee. The one can ne'er absolve thy Sins, And th'other (tho he now begins) Of Knav'ry ne'er can cure thee. But left we all shou'd end his Life, And with a keen-whet Chopping-Knife In a thousand pieces cleave him, Let the Parliament first him undertake, They'll make the Rascal stink at stake, And so like a Knave let's leave him, On the same. Since Justice Scroggs Pepys and Dean did bail, Upon the good Cause did turn his Tail, For two thousand Pounds to buy Tent and Ale. Which no body can deny. The Jury and Judg, to sham the Plot, Freed the Traitors to prove that it was not, But old England will stand when the Rogues go to pot; Which no body can deny. Scroggs was at first a Man of the blade, And with his Father follow'd the Butcherly Trade, But 'twas the Peter Pence made him a Jade; Which no body can deny. He'd stand by the Protestant Cause he said, And lift up his Eyes, and cry'd, We're betray'd; But then the Pettifogger was in Masquerade. Which no body can deny. When D?by mention'd to the King his Name, He said he had neither Honesty nor Shame, And would play any sort of Roguish Game. Which no body can deny. He swears he'd confound Bedlow and Oates, And prove the Papists Sheep, and the Protestants Goats, And that he's a Fool that on Property doats. Which no body can deny. The Pope's Advice and Benediction to his Judg and Jury in Eutopia. Well done my Sons, ye have redeem'd my Cause Beyond my Expectation, from the Jaws Of my curst Foes, the Protestants their Laws. For had you not thus timely stept between, They had endanger'd both my Cause and Queen, And then past all Redemption had it been. For Tyburn then more Martyrs had me sent, Which I had rather quick to the Devil went, Than my Designs so well contriv'd be shent. Go on and prosper, never change your Notes, The Sign o'th' Cross direct your open Throats, To cry not guilty, so you'l baffle Oates. Forsworn! no matter if you perjur'd be, You are dispens'd with, and you ought go free, 'Tis mighty Service to the Court and Me; Who will requite it, and for certain know My Pardons and Blessings on you I bestow, Besides the Gold you have receiv'd I owe. Far greater Sums, than e'er the Court yet gave To Pimp, or Cheat, or Traytor, Whore, or Knave, Might satisfy our Lust, our sinking Credit save. But that's not all, unless we do declare, And set our Mark upon our Fav'rites fair, That Hereticks may know them who they are. And first, dear Scroggs, with thee we shall begin, Altho of late thou wert a Man of Sin, And didst abuse those for us put you in. From which we now absolve ye as we're Pope, And do allow that Butchers by the Rope Begin, not end, for that would mar our hope. 'Tis true at first 'twas prudent, witty, quaint, To counterfeit the Devil, act the Saint, With zealous Thunder 'gainst the Jesuits complaint. This gain'd you credit with the Rabble Rout, Confirm'd the Choice of those that wish'd you out, But now that's done 'tis time to tack about: And dare to act to set my Vassals free, You shall receive from Holy James and Me A Crimson Cap, at least my Legate be, Provided you escape Tresilian's Triple Tree. Next, hated Ralph, thou Leader of the Van, My Papal Power shall do all it can, To make thee, next Election, Senate-Man. And reason good, for then my Cause will thrive, If all prove such, the Hereticks we'll drive Till not a Soul of them is left alive. Next follows all together half a dozen, Whom neither Sheriff (by Order) for me chosen, Who like good Men did Law and Justice cozen. They're all Right Roman, Sir George Wakeman's Jury. Howley, Hodges, Downton, And drew together Backthurst, Hempen, Heydown, Sworn to be true, but false as Jack of Leyden. Next were two Jades, Ball, Dobbing never right; In Rack and Manger lay these Beasts delight: Next were three Monsters, Avery, Whale, and White. These being collar'd all together, swore To do such Justice ne'er was done before, Prostrate their Wives to save the Common Whore: For which good Service most did places gain, One made the Wheeler unto Charles's Wain, And Taper-maker Lightman did obtain. Three more had places to their Hearts desire, Which York afforded, made them each Esquire, And all they were to do was set the Land on fire. Informing Dob—that's Landlord to Sir Wake, To save his Tenant golden Pills did take, Whose blessed Guilt before did make him quake. The rest had Gold (dropt by the Fairy Queen) Left in their Shoe, that she might pass unseen, Which expel'd Poison as't had never been. By this, my Sons, ye left them in the Lurch, And swept the Scandal off our Holy Church, Which erst stood tott'ring on a broken Crutch. Strangely reviv'd my Lordly Sons i'th' Tower, Who now transported laugh to scorn the Power Of Lords and Commons, from whom they fear'd a show'r. And o'er the Hereticks have advantage got, Who stopt the blest Proceeding of my Plot, No Oppositions left but Fanatick Sot. For which great Service Debtor we remain Till we get Britain in our Fist again, Then then be sure, we will requite your Pain. Till then adieu, Hell have you in its Care, And ever dictate what you say or swear, May make you useful to St. Peter's Chair. The Wolf-Justice. Being Certain Verses fix'd upon the L. C. J. Scroggs's Chamber-door. Here lives the Wolf-Justice, a Butcherly Knave, Who Protestants goals, but the Papists does save. He's a bold Persecutor contrary to Laws Of all that dare write for the Protestant Cause. Since these were his Actions, in vain were his Prate, And false Imprecations he printed of late. 'Twill one day be prov'd (Old Clodpate) that you Were brib'd by the Court and Portugal too. When Parliament. Par comes to Town, you'll receive such a check, Not your Speech nor your Pardon will save your Bull-Neck. Mean while go on and play England's Story, You'l hang at the last as Tresilian before ye. For we'll have the Plot punish'd, come on it what can be, In spite of Clodpate, York, Lauderdale, D?by. 'Tis not Prorogations shall serve the Rogue's Turn, We'll die at our doors e'er in Smithfield we'll burn. A Satire. His Holiness has three Grand Friends Upon Great-Britain's Shore, That prosecute his and their own Ends; A Duke, a Judg, and a Whore. The Duke is as true as Steel To the Pope, that infallible Elf; Therefore no Friend to the Commonweal, Nor no Friend to himself. The Judg is a Butcher's Son, Yet hates to shed innocent Blood, But for ten thousand Pounds has done The Pope a great deal of good. He did that Villain Wakeman clear, Who was to have poison'd the King, As it most plainly did appear; For which he deserves a Swing. Portsmouth, that Pocky Bitch, A damn'd Papistical Drab; An ugly deform'd Witch Eaten up with the Mange and Scab. This French Hag's Pockey Bum So powerful is of late; Altho it's both blind and dumb, It rules both Church and State. A Pun. Take a T?d Upon my word, And into five parts cut it, And put it Into a Pye, To convince Our good Prince, What it can be, To mince Thomas Earl of D?by Into five Commissioners and a Guy. A Caution to King Charles the Second from Forty One. Hold fast thy Sword and Scepter, Charles, Sad times are coming on, The murm'ring of thy Senate House Smells rank of Forty One. When Kings are call'd to give Account What their Expences be, It is a sign we all are Kings, Or that no King shall be. Give way but to their Will a while, And you will find as great A Will in them to act anew, From Forty One to Eight. Hold cruel England, hold; in thee Sure all Rebellion springs, Consider but thy Infamy To kill the best of Kings. The World against thee will exclaim, Thy Cruelty abhor, That thus delights in killing Kings And raising Civil War. England's Court-Strumpets. Since Cleveland is fled till she's brought to Bed, And Nelly is quite forgotten, And Mazarine is as old as the Queen, And Portsmouth the young Whore is rotten. Since Women at Helm, have ruin'd the Realm, And Statesmen have lost their Anchors, The Lords and the Commons know what will come on us, But the Kingdom must break like the Bankers. Since Ravenhouse is come let's send them all home, But still let's secure the Millions: 'Twill serve for a Farce to clap a French Arse, Or serve the next new-come Italian. On the Monument upon Fish-street Hill. When Hodge first spy'd the Labour-in-vain, Grown since he pass'd by Pudding-lane; To reach his Chin up as he gaz'd, Till level'd with his Forehead rais'd, With Face that Horizontal lies, With gaping Mouth and staring Eyes; Supporting on his Staff his Jaw, He took the Height of what he saw: As one that makes an Observation, Chap fall'n he stood with Admiration. Hodge was (altho to Cart confin'd) A Virtuoso in his kind; And long he stockt up in his Crown Whate'er he saw or heard in Town: Within his musty Fancy mew'd, Heated into Similitude: That whatsoever Subject fell, He Bargains ready had to sell. Tho the Similitude's most pat, Shews that Men say they know not what. The Description. A new Spout to quench the Fire, Or else to draw the Smoak up higher: A Model of a Pepper-Box, Or Microscope to view an Ox; Or else a Candlestick to place a Light For such as travel in the Night: Or Christmas Candle over-grown, Not to shew Light, but to be shown: Or else a Torch with gilded Flames, To steer the Boats that row on Thames: Or else a Piece of Art and Labour, Of Hook?out Architecting Baber. When long he thus himself had guest, Nor could the swallow'd Sight digest; He ask'd a Wag at the next Stall, To whom belongs this House so tall? The Boy's Answer. The City Monument is this, In token that our Mayor did piss. It seems when London's Mayor does stale, She by consent too lays her Tail. Bodies so great may bear the Expence Of such a vast Sirreverence: But 'tis a Heap which would have rent All but the City's Fundament. Rex &amp; Grex. Rex and Grex are of one Sound, But Dux does Rex and Grex confound. If Crux of Dux could have his fill, Then Rex of Grex might have his Will. Five Subsidies to ten would turn, And Grex would laugh, that now does mourn. Oh Rex! thy Grex does still complain, That Dux bears Crux, and Crux not Dux again. A Westminster Wedding: Or, the Town-Mouth; alias, the Recorder of London and his Lady. Feb. 17. 1679. 'Tis said when George did Dragon slay, He sav'd a Maid from cruel Fray. But this Sir George, whom Knaves do brag on, Mist of the Maid, and caught the Dragon; Since which the furious Beast so fell, Stares, roars, and yawns like Mouth of Hell: He raves and tears; his bad Condition Distracts his Mind as late Petition. Peace Man or Beast (or both) to please ye; A Parliament will surely ease ye. Marriage and Hanging both do go By Destiny: Sir George, if so, You stand as fairly both to have, As ever yet did Fool or Knave: The first your Wife hath help'd ye to, The other as a Rogue's your due: No other way is left to tame ye; And if you have it not, then blame me. But e'er it comes and things are fitting, Judg of his Merits by his getting: He'as got a ven'mous Heart and Tongue, With Vipers, Snakes and Adders hung: By which in Courts he plays the Fury, Hectors Complainants, Law and Jury: His Impudence hath all Laws broken, (To th'Judges honour be it spoken) For which he got a Name that stinks Worse than the common Jakes or Sinks. But to allay the Scent so hot, George from the Court has Knighthood got Bestow'd upon him for his bawling, A Royal Mark for Caterwauling: But certain George must never boast on't, 'Cause Traytors, Cheats and Pimps have most on't. Now Rogue enough he got in favour, To bind good Men to worse Behaviour; And bark aloud they will deceive ye, In that he matches Tribe of Levi; Who now with Pope bear all before 'em, Priests made Just—Asses of the Quorum. Faith, make 'em Judges too, most fine-o, And then they'll preach it all Divino. There's somewhat more that George has got, (For Sir John Trevor, said to be his Lady's Gallant in the time of her Widowhood, &amp;c. Trevor left him who knows what) A teeming Lady-Wife, nay more, A Hansenkelder got before: As true a Wench they say for kissing, As e'er her Sir Tho. Bloodworth, Lord-Mayor in the time of the dreadful Fire of London, 1666. Father was for pissing; Who thought his Tool could Fire quench, Because it oft had serv'd his Wench. O happy City! when the Brains, Sir, Of Elders—hangs in Furs and Chains, Sir. But one thing more I can't let pass, When George with Sir Wil. Scroggs Lord C. Justice. Clodpate feasted last, (I must say Clodpate was a Sinner, To jerk his Brother so at Dinner;) He by his Almanack did discover, His Wife scarce thirty Weeks went over, E'er she (poor thing) in pieces fell, Which made Mouth stare and bawl like Hell; And Puppy-like there told him truly, First Leap he had was but last July. What then, you Fool, some Wives miscarry, And reckon June for January. This Clodpate did assert as true, Which he by old Experience knew; But all his canting would not do. George put him to't upon denial, Which set him hard as Wakeman's Trial: They rail'd and bawl'd, and kept a pother, And like two Curs did bite each other; Which brought some Sport, but no Repentance, So off they went to Ben. Harris the Bookseller. Harris' Sentence, Which soon they pass'd against all Laws, To glut their Rage and Popish Cause: For which Injustice, Knaves we hope You'll end together in the Rope: And when the Gallows shall you swallow, We'll throw up Caps, and once more hollow. If this we wish from private Grudg, Or as their Merit, England's Judg: Who seek the Nation to enthral, Are treacherous Slaves and Villains all. And when Confusion such does follow, We'll throw up Caps, and once more hollow. That's their Exit, Tho they Rex-it, We shall Grex-it. The Fancy: Or, The D. of York's last Farewel. As I a walking was the other day, (Where do not ask me, for I will not say) I fancy'd 'mongst a Grove of Trees I spy'd A Man stood musing by a Water-side: I wish 'twas but a Fancy, but no doubt You'll think it more when you have heard it out. The Person was a very tall black Man, Above the common Size almost a Span; His Face was melted in most piteous sort, In all things else he was of Royal Port. But if ill Looks alone Majestick be, Commend me to that Face for Majesty, For't had enough, I'll swear, for two or three. To this tall Man instantly join'd another, Of just his Stature, whom he call'd his Brother: Richly encircled with a numerous Ring, Which shew'd he wanted nought but th'Name of King. Some time they silent stood, till all were gone, When tallest bid his Brother to go on, Which thus he did.— I shall, Great Sir, my last Discourse retrieve, I pray you like Attention to it give: Your Case peculiar is, peculiar too Must be your Care, or you'll your self undo. For humble Stations, Industry or Wit, A second Way may find, if first don't hit: But he that's mounted on a Sov'reign Throne, Ne'er had nor can have other ways than one To curb the saucy Vulgar, and pull down Their Cobweb Rights that circumscribe the Crown; Take off their Shackles, let the Bumkins know, No other Almighty is than you below. You spoil your Game, Sir, while you do thus dally, Who follows him that stands on shall I, shall I? You cow the Bold, and keen the Coward's Heart, Whilst you divided act the doubtful Part. Had you when this damn'd City flam'd but run, And cut their cursed Throats, your Work you'd done: Their Blood you shou'd have made the Fire meet, With Bodies fed the Flames in ev'ry Street. To do and undo sorts well sorry things, But is beneath the Majesty of Kings. Cæsar, or nothing's writ on all they do, True Monarchs know no Medium 'tween these two. What is't you stick at, Sir, would you retreat? You're now too far engag'd, and must them beat, Or beaten be; rid or be ridden now: He never back must look who holds the Plough. May be you would not Promise break, or Oath; Pish! all the World does know you can do both. With great Advice but t'other day you said By Parliaments and Councils you'd be led: To-day you think it fit to let us know, (What e'er you said) you ne'er intended so. Fools to their Word, but Princes great like you, To nought but their Intentions must be true. What is't the Laws you tender are to break? It's known that's but a Scruple, and too weak: For Laws are nothing, but the Ties and Bands Are made to shackle up your Subjects Hands. Your silly Clergy, Sir, tho meer Jackdaws, Yet they do preach you up above all Laws, That Laws 'bove Subjects are, but that the King (God bless him) is 'bove Laws and ev'ry thing; And teach from sacred Leaves, not any thing Of Law or Promise can confine a King. Or for meet Tools is't you so doubtful are? If this be it, I'll ease you of that Care; Damn'd Villains of intrinsick Worth I have, And more obedient than a Turkish Slave: If you but bid 'em thrust their bloody Knives In Fathers Throats, in Childrens, or in Wives; In any but their own, they'll ready do't, And lay them sprawling at your sacred Foot. I have my Teagues and Tories at my beck, Will wring their Necks off like a Chicken's Neck: Try'd Rogues that never shall so much as start, To tear from Mother's Womb the Infant's Heart. First rape, then rip her up in half an hour; Two Lusts they'll satiate, do but give them Power. Faint Rogues will melt and have their Qualms of Fears At Father's Groans, or at a Mother's Tears: But mine are Monsters fit for any Prince, Not plagu'd with Conscience, no nor pain'd with Sense. The Flames of Hell, Horrour of endless Pain, (Those Clergy-Cheats to propagate their Gain) They ridicule, and scorn to lend an ear; Let Knaves for Profit preach, and Fools go hear The Tales of future Bliss, not worth a Rush; One Bird in hand with them's worth two i'th'Bush. Others now serve you but for constant Pay; My Hounds will hunt, and live upon their Prey. A Virgin's Haunch, or well-bak'd Lady's Breast, To them is better than a Ven'son Feast: Babes Pettitoes cut large in Arms and Legs, They far prefer 'fore Pettitoes of Pigs: Poor span-long Infants that like Carps are stew'd In their own Blood, their Irish Chaps have chew'd; And Fathers Cauls have Candles made to light Those damn'd inhuman Banquets of the Night. Whate'er you'd have, whate'er your Fancy craves, But nod, 'tis done by my obedient Slaves. They know no Scruple, no Commands dispute; But do't as ready as a Turkish Mute. You see, Sir, where you are; your Royal Date Grows out if you don't soon support the State. To shake off Parliaments may be too great, And put you in too violent a Sweat: To baffle therefore, but not cast them off; To hold them still, but hold them but in scoff, Must be your Work; for we are weaken'd so, That we must drive the Nail that first will go: And this too we must do with gentle Hand, That tho they see, they may not understand. When January comes, Cold and ill Way Will call it Love to put 'em off till May. In May some odd Intelligence comes newly, Won't suffer you to hold them until July: And July's so with Heat and Sickness vext, Pity prorogues them to November next; And time's ill manag'd if before that day We able be'nt to throw all Masks away. This far exceeds Dissolvings, in my mind, And gives to our Designs a better Blind. For if two Parliaments you slight, I doubt The Rogues will then begin to scent us out. For watchful with erected Looks, the Herd Stands list'ning now, concerned and afeard. As Covy half o'erspread, half scap'd the Net, Are ten times harder than at first to set: So People slipt out of the Noose or Train, Are much more harder to be caught again. With Prorogation therefore short and soft, They must be treated: these repeated oft, Will chafe them so, that either mad with Rage, They'll bring the old Rebellion on the Stage; Or sullen sit, and sleer on all you do, (The far more dangerous Humour of the two) Their dogged Nature now its Venom vents, In chusing damn'd and plaguy Parliaments. Poor Fools! their Rage does far out-run their Wit, For you must ne'er intend that they shall sit: But mock their Choice, and mock their Sessions too, No other way we have our Work to do. One Plot is better than ten Parliaments; They give but Taxes, this shou'd give their Rents. A thousand of the richest in we'll skrew Into a Plot they never heard or knew. If three hundred thousand Pounds a year would do, I'll three times three by this Plot help you to. This Sir's the bus'ness, how to get fit Stuff Is all the Care, and I have Rogues enough; Do you but Judges get, I'll Juries find, And Witnesses according to your Mind. They're such poor Rogues, 'twill do you good to hear How daring, bold, and bravely they will swear; They shan't, like Bedlow, Dugdale, Oates, and such, Consider first, for fear they speak too much; Nor let their Conscience maim their Evidence, Thro tender Fear of hurting Innocence: Nor do I care for a Fanatick Noose, All shall Fanaticks be have ought to lose; Judg, Jury, Witnesses, we'll all ensure, And Devil's in't if all be not secure. Yet shou'd this miss, don't you discourag'd be; To form a new, leave to my Priests and me. Like Pins, one Plot shall drive another out, Till we have brought our only Plot about. First work to save your Friends, that Point well done, (Like Shirts) more Plots we've to our Backs than one. They fain would foil your Plots, and fill your Ears With Regicide Intents, to raise your Fears. This fruitless Gun, that Dagger stabs your Belly, When you know all better than they can tell ye. Go on, Sir, never fear the heedless Herd, They have no Courage but when you're afeard: On me lay all the fault of Crown and Age, I'll safely skreen you from the Peoples Rage: And when ill accident a Plot does spoil; Me they'll call Rogue, but you Most Gracious stile: For Loyalty awes them in ev'ry thing; Tho you destroy them, yet God save the King. Tho you them stab, and I but hold the Knife, Yet still they'll pray for's Majesty's long Life. Now I'll step in, mine shall be the next Fate; But I'll do something shall deserve their Hate. Thus, greatest Sir, you're greatest Prince alive, If Plot according to its Prospect thrive; And thrive it shall, if you'll but do your part, And from proposed Methods never start. For Plots like Clockwork are, one Pin pull'd out, Does all its Order and its Beauty rout. Steddy your Hand, keep Parliaments at bay, Not on, nor off, nor working, nor at play: Clip ev'ry Tongue you find does hang too long, It's taking Wind makes ev'ry thing scent strong. This if you do, ill Fortune I'll defy, All other things pray leave to Fate and I. And now I'll dive again beneath the Show, And act my Puppets will by Art below. He being gone, in steps a certain Lord, Who had seen all, and heard too ev'ry Word: Great Sir, said he, Who can tell what to say? If you by Popish Counsels mean to sway, Curs'd be that Counsel, and the Men that do Persuade you to your Ruin, and ours too! A Thousand, Sir, Ten Thousand let your Brother In's next Book write, if he dare write another. Ten Gentry envies now what one has got, For God's sake write us all in the next Plot; All but your Papists, Sir, all but a few (O shame to name it!) of our Clergy Crew. Bate but these two, and let them take the Pole, They'll hardly get another English Soul. For one's damn'd Envy, and the other's Pride, Have reconcil'd all England else beside. Higher Huffs than his could ne'er this Nation awe, On our side stand the People and the Law. For don't mistake, Sir, it's by Law alone Your Right's derived to our English Throne. Set that aside, and make the Law a Sham; No Sov'reign you, nor I no Subject am. For self-same Laws give you your Dignity, Give me my Life, my Fortune, Liberty. Pardon if, Sir, less decent this is said, Than doth become a Member to his Head. For this sound Doctrine is, tho cully Brother And Clergy Wights would fain bring up another. Within the Circle of the Law, great Sir, I stand, but out of it will never stir: If to be King you'll be content, I will Pay you Allegiance and Obedience still. The Peoples Right and their brave English Laws Do make the strongest Side and justest Cause. 'Tis not your keeping us from Parliaments Can further or advantage your Intents. For greater are the Chusers than the Choice, England's Freeholders have a mighty Voice. Those we'll unite, and those associate; And if we can't defend our Lives and State, We'll fairly fall, and Freemen to our Graves We'll rather go by far, than to live Slaves. Our Ancestors shan't curse us in their Tombs, (Nor shall our Children in their Mothers Wombs) They left us free, and We ours free will leave, Or Death our Hopes and us shall both deceive. Thus said, with threatning Looks he went away, And I trudg'd too, as quite afraid to stay: But as I went, I met with honest Nelly, And when I more do hear, I more will tell ye. A Bill on the House of Commons Door, April the 15th, 1680. Gentlemen, When last you were here th'House was to be lett, But now to the Pope and the Frenchmen 'tis set; If you'll club in amongst them, be quickly resolv'd, Or else you must home again—rogu'd or dissolv'd. We'll try for another may serve our Intention, That will England betray for a Place or a Pension; That's the Life of the Cause, and the End of Invention. We lost an old Sett wou'd have done it no doubt, But Pox on ill Luck, for Rogue Tommy was out, Cou'd we get 'em again, we'd hug and collogue 'em, Nor D?y, nor Dutchess should ever prorogue 'em. An honest Endeavour to make us all Slaves: Pray which the worst Evil, the Cause or the Knaves? Old Albion looks ill, she was heard to complain, Her Head, Oh! her Head was the Cause of the Pain: It's all on a Lump, for it cannot discover 'Twixt its Catholick Foes and the Protestant Lover. Her Empricks, and Quacks, called Divine, and some Civil, Advise her to bleed again for the King's Evil; But better the Rogues were sent quick to the Devil. What, bleed an old Woman, Spring, Winter, and Fall! Don't you know she's too old to be practis'd withal! But if you do venture once more to attempt it, It's Forty to One you're the first that repent it. For your Plots, and your Murders, and Treasons shall try you, Tho Monsieur, and Tories, and Devils stand by you. Faxit Deus. The Respondent: or Litany for Litany.

Judg with a Perriwig to his Waste hanging down; A Sey?r. Speaker of the Commons that never wore a Gown. A Litany.

From a French Whore at Whitehall, and another at Paris, From Dangerfield's Plot outdone by Fitz-Harris; Deliver us Lord from the self-same thing, From the King of France, and from the French King. The Downfal of the French Bitch, England's Metropolitan Strumpet, The three Nation's Grievance, The pickled pocky Whore, Rowley's Dalilah; all in a word, The damn'd dirty Dutchess. What! down in the Dirt? By St. Leonard her Grace Stinks vilely I'll warrant: That ominous place Works upward and downward, has giv'n her a Glister, To find her self tumble just over her Sister. Make haste to Newmarket to air the French Tool, If Rowley should smell her, 'twould give him a Stool. The Wench of St. Martins who gave us the Clap, Or Nelly, drawn in Kennel, as 'twas her Mishap, Or the thing that beshit us having got the wild squirt, Was nothing so noisom as Dutchess i'th' Dirt. Then faugh! Carwel, faugh! for a stinking French Bitch; Jane Shore was more wholesom when dead in a Ditch. How came the Mischance, if it was one, let's know? Had the spoil of the Land o'erballanc'd her so, That she sunk by the Weight her Whoredom had gotten To be her support now her Carcase is rotten? Never Whore so mistaken! Faith, Rowley, her Grace Is lame on all four, not fit for the Race. Let Shoreditch be famous for the Fall and the Foil It has given two Whores, who sunk in its Soil. Had the last but lain by it as long as the first, It had eas'd three Nations that in her are curs'd. Howe'er we all thank you, you did your Endeavour, To have laid her as fast, and unwilling to leave her. The Men of Art tell us the Stars do portend, That her Fall in that place presages her End: As Rowley grows stiff, and can leap her no more, She'll rot in a Ditch as her Sister Jane Shore. Pray Heaven it prove so! then Gadbury shall, If he guess right in this, be pardon'd for all. The Obscure Prince, Or, The Black Box boxed. O Heavens! the Weakness of my unkind Father! Better some Peasant had begot me rather: He wou'd not black himself, his Wife defame, And after Marriage Bastard me proclaim; Through panick Fear thus in Perillus roar, To gratify a Brother, or a Whore, Honour disclaim, by Fools and Knaves beguil'd, Nay, wou'd it pass, deny me for his Child: Destroy my Right 'gainst God and Nature's Laws, To prop the falling of their tott'ring Cause: Pursue a Chace more of the Goose than Fox, Call'd the shamm'd Story of the blackned Box; Deny the Truth long in the Ashes hid, Disowning now what Bishop Fuller did; How he perform'd the Marriage-Office, e'er You cou'd enjoy my wronged Mother dear. All other Terms she scorned with her Soul, Tho means were us'd with her both fair and foul; Witness your self what Mother-Queen did do, Besides the Offers that were made by you; When mighty Passions brought you down so ill, Your Grief befool'd the French Physician's Skill, And at grim Death's approaches out did cry, O! Let me marry with her, or I die: 'Twas then she yielded and became your Wife. Sir, this is truth, I'll prove it with my Life: But you may save the Trouble if you please, Speak like your self, and all the Kingdom ease. You are my Father, Sir, I'll Duty pay Unto your self until your dying-day. But when that falls (which God foreslow) Sir, I Will take the Name of Royal Majesty, Without offence to any, as my due, Giv'n me by God, by Nature, Sir, and You: Then (if I live) the wronged World shall know, In Wedlock I was got, and born in't too, That I am Heir undoubted to the Crown, And will enjoy it when you lay it down, In spite of Papists, mauger all their Hate, Their Hope shall find I am legitimate. England stand by me with your utmost Breaths, I'll ruin Rome, or die ten thousand Deaths; And make France tremble also e'er I've done, Destroy those Plagues that murder Christendom. That true Religion in the Land may flow, Not Forms and Int'rest which are called so: And shou'd I ever alter what I say, Let God forsake me on my dying-day. Enough, brave Prince, we'll take your Royal Word, And will defend you by the dint of Sword 'Gainst all Opposers whosoe'er they are; We'll stand or fall, and in your Fortunes share: And after Charles, who wrongs you of your Crown, Shall cut a Million of true English down. Honi soit qui mal y pense. Upon the Dispute in the Choice of Sheriffs, this Paper following was spread abroad, directed to the Worthy Citizens of London. Respice &amp; Cave. Gentlemen; Now is the time, acquit your selves like Men, Else who can say you'll ever see't agen? Divide not for your Lives, their Work is done, Down must the Papists go, and Sir George Jefferies. Mouth must run: Let not his Imprecations us befool, He's worse than mad that trusts a Yorkist's Tool. Shou'd he now chuse us Sheriffs, Sir William Scroggs. Clodpate Juries, We fall as Victims to their Popish Furies. O! Heaven direct us to unite we pray, Old England's Fate depends upon this Day, And those unborn too bless or curse us may. Idem. [Lewis of France hath been the Protestants Scourge] Lewis of France hath been the Protestants Scourge, And Sir Simon Lewis then Sheriff of London. Lewis of London is the Papists Drudg; One plays the Tyrant to uphold his Lust, And London's Villain doth betray his Trust. Tyrant and Traitor Lewis is no less, And Mouth and Clodpate do make up the mess: Close up the Poll, or Lewis, by this Light, Your own shall off, to do the City right. On Dr. Stil????fleet Dean of St. Paul's. So have I seen a Dean of St. Paul's, (Irenicum withdrawn) Shifting about to blow the Coals For Rome against dissenting Souls, And all for Sleeves of Lawn. An Advertisement to a Protestant Grand-Jury. Slight not these following Lines, Or count them idle things: A Stander-by sees more sometimes Than those that game with Kings. Forewarn'd, fore-arm'd. Mack-Ninnies Case looks desperate, The Papists Cause the same; The Traitors struggle with their Fate: Then Patriots now beware their Hate; Look to your selves e'er 't be too late, Or all is on a Flame. A Country Hodg heard Tories say, As he was walking home, October's three and twentieth Day Began the bloody Irish Fray, And then to Edg-Hill took its way, Remember Forty One. This trusty Roger told for true, 'Tis odds he guesses right; Mack—had prepar'd his murd'ring Crew At unawares to murder you, And by that Blow the Land subdue, As ye sit late at Night. Unless in time ye him prevent, Be arm'd against those Fears: Ne'er trust to Rowley's Compliment, When Actions speak the ill Intent, Who never yet lov'd Parliament, Whate'er he says or swears. What if 'tis said that Mack—shall go, The Fool the Knave may trust: Stand on your Guard, prevent this Blow, No matter whether he runs or no, 'Tis you must Papists overthrow, Let Devil do his worst. Historia Tuta. Henry the Prince fell by his trembling Sire, Who by his Recreant Son did next expire. Proud of his ill-got State, enthron'd he stands, And on the People lays oppressive Hands. They unaccustom'd to the heavy Yoke, Punish his Rapines by a fatal Stroke. A Brother to the next creates much Strife, Aims at his Crown, and daily seeks his Life: Him easy, vain, and weak Court-Pimps deceive, And Brother's Crimes Priests bid him not believe; Hence stupid grown, Sloth, Lust, and want of Care Draw dismal Ruin on him unaware. This Truth the Roman Poets sang of old, And in Majestick Satire did unfold: Kings without Wounds rarely resign their Breath, And Tyrants never die a Civil Death. Utrum horum mavis accipe. Sit or sit not, by Law or Sword, Mack falls as flat as Council-board: Maintain our Rights, stand fast together; He hangs, runs, sights, e'en chuse him whether. Triennial Laws with Resolution Can cure that Plague of Dissolution. Let Rowley know unto his Face, If Law and Justice can't take place, We'll quit the Land of Bothwell's Race. The City's Advice to the King. But t'other day from Exile not by Force, With shouts of Joy, as Troy their Trojan Horse, We took thee in and plac'd thee on the Throne, Prefer'd thy Happiness before our own; And shew'd the World there is no other thing Holds half the Plagues in't as a thankless King. We full of Peace, of Honour, and of Trade, Were with soft Ease and Riches wanton made; And such a Surfeit took of Happiness, 'Twas only thou couldst cure our great Excess; And thy dear Dose hath done it in a minute, And cur'd us quite, or else the Devil's in it. We then cou'd go to Bed without the Fears Of having our Houses fir'd about our Ears. Secure we slept without the dismal fright Of Murders, Rapes and Massacres i'th' Night. But thou, great Prince, hast cur'd us of this Ease, When e'er we die 'twon't be of that Disease: For now our Sleep like those in Hell appears, We always wake with Flames about our Ears. Most graciously we once wholesale were burn'd, And more than all our City to Ashes turn'd: E'er since with retail Fires, now here, now there, As pleas'd Rome's Rage, and as their Mark cou'd bear. And now the new Health 'mongst the Tory Crew, Is to our second Conflagration; strange, but true! Yet these thy Darlings are, and only please thee, Not one that honest is, in England's easy: Poor Prince! how hast thou lost thy worthy Braves For such a cursed pack of Fools and Knaves. Consider, Charles, was't we, or this vile Rout Made thy Return, and ev'ry Street to shout? They drank thy Health, and damn'd themselves or so; But greater good ne'er did, nor can they do: What Fund is this for either Peace or Wars? An Angel's Art can't steer by such Pole-Stars. Go poll each starved Courtezan and Whore, Each Clergy Wight and Tory, then give o'er, For all the Land won't yield thee one Man more. For ev'ry Soul besides (thine Eyes may see) Are English now again, thank God and thee. Betimes consider then thy wandring State, The Wheel runs swift, it soon may be too late. Thy People yet would fain preserve thy Throne, Don't force 'em make thy Brother's Crimes thine own; For tho they don't believe thee free from Guilt, Yet they'll ne'er spy thy Faults unless thou wilt. Close quickly then, let go thy Brother Elf, Or next remove of Rage may find thy self. By Nature English People willing are To whip their Princes Mates, but them to spare: But if to ruin them their Rulers go, And will protect their own and Peoples Foes, No Man (or Men) their Fury then e'er knows. Take then Advice before the time be gone; Sad Fate of Father shou'd instruct the Son: The self-same Crew was his delight, are thine; The best he lowr'd on, and on the worst did shine. Teagues, Tories, Ruffians pleas'd him to the heart: But ill-plac'd Pleasures ever end in smart. How will the Age unborn thy Conduct mock, If thou shalt split upon the self-same Rock. As th'ill-skill'd Pilot's blam'd, and not his Luck, That runs same spot he saw his Lanthorn struck: So write for Oracle, same Foes, same Friends, Bring them that follow them, to th'self-same Ends. On Mun Doyly and Fleet Shepherd, Esquires. Fat, ruddy, and dull, With an Inch-thick of Skull; But false as the Bags of his Brother; Is that Caterer for News, In Taverns and Stews, Mun Doyly the Son of his Mother. The great Legg hearing this, Thought all was amiss; And to run his Intelligence higher, Resolv'd at a Jump, To leven that Lump, With Shepherd that voluble Lyar. What notable Tools Are a Brace of such Fools, In the hands of a young Politician; When the Colonel did chuse False Wit, and false News, Sure he needed much more a Physician. Yet poor Shepherd may prove In time, by Legg's Love, As famous as Markham or Needham: Or Berkinhead the Great, Who employs all his Sweat In witty smart Ballads (God speed him.) Return to the Pot, Thou damn'd drolling Sot, In time, lest the Gallows attend thee; For thou'lt ne'er make so good A Spy as old Blood, Tho Billing and Mead do befriend thee. In Alehouses dipt, From Oxford thou wert whipt, For thy witty Deceits to the Tapster: T' has e'er since been thy way, Thy best Friends to betray; Clancy proceeded not faster. A RIDDLE. Who's he that's no body's Friend, Whose Levees yet great Men attend; Who in Retirement loves to sneak, Yet for Domesticks oft does seek? Folly and Innocence do him dread, He's hated, yet he's followed, And is interr'd before he's dead. His Retinue's kept at others Cost, And when he's curst, he prospers most. ANOTHER. I stand but on one Leg, yet do sustain Much Weight, beside a noted Rogue in grain, And 'twere an ill Wind which blew him no gain. He gives me Clothes, when fast he'd have me run, But strips me naked, when his Work I've done. Then I, with Arms across, expos'd do stand, Forc'd to submit to ev'ry Turn of Hand, And to inconstant unseen Pow'rs command. I once encounter'd was by hardy Fool, Who'ad got my Namesake lodg'd within his Skull; He me attack'd in wild and frantick Mood, And I my Ground, tho in swift Motion, stood. He from my Arms receiv'd a stunning Blow, Yet what I was the Coxcomb did not know; And you're more wise, if you guess what I'm now. Third Riddle. Close to my Owner I adher'd, Till bloody Hands me from him tear'd: In Warmth and Quietness we liv'd, And, while together, well we thriv'd; But naked now Men me expose, And I excite them too to Blows. Dumb was I born, still have no Voice, Yet Courts and Camps I fill with Noise. I liv'd in Peace, now serve in Wars, Was Innocent, but now at Bars Am try'd, where I move endless Jars. Great Rogues trade in me by whole-sale, In Parcels too they me retail: But when their greater use I fail, Small lowsy Thieves do in me deal, And serve their Ends of me piece-meal. Song. [The Widows and Maids] To the old Tune of, Taking of Snuff is the Mode of the Court. 1 The Widows and Maids May now hold up their Heads; There are Men to be had for all uses: But who could presage, That ever one Age Should be furnish'd with two Tom Lucys? 2 Since his Grace could prefer The Poulterer's Heir, To the great Match his Uncle had made him: 'Twere just if the King Took away his blue String, And sew'd him on two to lead him. 3 That the Lady was sent To a Convent at Ghent, Was the Counsel of Kidnapping Grafton; And we may now foretel, That all will go well, Since the rough Blockhead governs the soft one. 4 Moll Hinton best knows, Why Newburgh kept close; But it need never trouble her Conscience: 'Twas Duty to clap That impertinent Fop; For it sav'd us abundance of Nonsense. 5 For one that loves Peace, And would live at his Ease, Northampton the best way has chosen; Leaves courting the Fair To his Uncle's Care, And the combating Part to his Cousin. 6 In Shrewsbury we find A gen'rous Mind, So kindly to live with his Mother; And never try yet To revenge the sad Fate Of his Father and only Brother. 7 Thus fighting we see, With some Folks won't agree; A Witness a much safer Post is: And tho my Lord Grey In the Field ran away, He could charge in a Court of Justice. 8 'Tis pleasant to hear An eminent Sund?land. Peer, Make Whoring a Case of Conscience: When 'tis so well known, His Favour begun By pimping to Portsmouth not long since. 9 'Tis a very plain Case, That the Dorchester. Countess's Disgrace The Catholick Cause advances: 'Tis also as plain, That Tyrconnel's chief Aim Was to bring in his Daughter Frances. 10 That Church will dispense With no Heretick Wench; And yet we have this for our comfort; Tho the Priest at the Court Forbid us that Sport, The Chancery allows us a Montfort. 11 Thrice fortunate Boy, Who canst give double Joy, And at every Turn be ready, With Pleasures in store, Behind and before, To delight both my Lord and my Lady. SONG. [What think you of this Age now] To the Tune of, A begging we will go. 1 What think you of this Age now, When Popery's in Request; And he's the loyal'st Subject, Slights not the Laws the least? When a Torying they do go, do go, do go, When a Torying they all go. 2 What think you of a Whiggish Plot, And of their Evidence, When all the Laws cannot protect The Peoples Innocence? When a swearing they do go, do go, do go, When a swearing they do go. 3 What think you of a Grey. General, That did betray his Monmouth. Lord, For which he does deserve to swing In Ketch's Hempen Cord? Such a Rogue you ne'er did know, did know, did know, Such a Rogue you ne'er did know. 4 What think you to be try'd, Sir, By Proclamation Laws, And zealously destroy a Monmouth. Prince, T'advance the Popish Cause? And to Mass to make us go, us go, us go, And to Mass to make us go. 5 What think you of the Chancellor? Besure he'll do the Work; Establish a Religion, Altho it were the Turk? And for In'trest he'll do so, do so, do so, And for Int'rest he'll do so. 6 In Lime-street now we do say Mass, T'advance the Popish Cause, And set the Mayor to guard it Against his Oath and Laws? To the Court you must bow low, bow low, bow low, To the Court you must bow low. 7 And what think you of proving A Popish Army awful, And bantering the Church with Arguments unlawful? But a fiddling let him go, him go, him go, But a fiddling let him go. 8 What would you give to be, Sir, In contrite Prance's Place, And sentenc'd to a Pillory For one small Mite of Grace? When recanting he did go, did go, did go, When recanting he did go. 9 What think you of our Penal Laws, That made the Pope to bow? If damn'd Rogues had not betray'd us, They'd been as penal now. But their Opinions were not so, not so, not so, Their Opinions were not so. 10 Yet fear we not, that bug?ing Dog, That sits in Porph'ry Chair, That swears he is infallible, 'Cause he's St. Peter's Heir? 'Tis a Lye we all do know, do know, do know, 'Tis a Lye we all do know. A Stanza put on Westminster-Hall-Gate. When Nature's God for our Offences dy'd, Among the Twelve one Judas did reside. Here's Twelve assembled for the Nation's Peace, Among which Twelve, Eleven are Judasses. One's true to's Trust, but all the rest accord With Jews and Pagans to betray their Lord. What Madness, Slaves! what was't cou'd you provoke To stoop once more unto the Romish Yoke? May you be curs'd, and all your Hopes demolish'd, And perish by those Laws you have abolish'd. To the Judges. Dignify'd Things, may I your leave implore To kiss your Hands, and your high Heads adore? Judges you are, but you are something more. May I draw near, and with a rough hewn-Pen Give a small Draught of you, the worst of Men: Tell of your Merits, and your mighty Skill, And how your Charms all Courts of Justice fill: Your Laws far stronger than the Commons Votes, So finely flow from your dispensing Throats. What Rome will ask, you must not her deny; If Hell command you too, you must comply. There's none but you would in this Cause combine; Things made like Men, but act like Brutes and Swine. Law-Books are Trash, a Student's but a Drudge, Learn to say, Yes, he's an accomplish'd Judge. He wins the Scarlet Robe, and wears it too; Ay, and deserves it well for more's his due: All that compleats a Traytor, dwells in you. Thus you like Villains to the Benches get, Where, in defiance to the Laws, you sit, And all base Actions that will please commit. There must you toil for Rome, and there must try Your Irish Sense and Cobweb Policy; Compleat your Crimes, and then you're fit to die. True Loyal Babes, Pimps to the Church of Rome, Tresilian's Heirs, Heirs to his Crimes and Doom. Was e'er the Hall fill'd up with such a Brood, All dipt in Treasons, Villanies, and Blood? Worse than Phanatick Priests; for they being prest By a wild Prince, preach'd to repeal the Test. Then here's the Diff'rence 'twixt you Popish Tools; You're downright Rogues, they only Knaves and Fools. A new Catch. This worthy Corps where shall we lay? In hallow'd, or unhallow'd Clay? Th' unhallow'd best befits him dead, Who, living, from the hallow'd fled. Then in the Vestry be his Tomb, Since that he made his Drinking Room; While to avoid the Common-Pray'r, He soop'd off his French Pottage there. But now alas! near Newgate thrown, E'er Tyburn could obtain its own, He's gone to sleep with Brethren blest, In Baxter's Saints e'erlasting Rest. Enter Oliver's Porter, Fidler and Poet in Bedlam. The Scene adorn'd with several of the Poet's own Flowers. Porter. O Glory! Glory! Who are these appear? My Fellow-Servants, Poet, Fidler here? Old Hodge the constant, Johnny the sincere! Who sent you hither? And pray tell me why A horrid Silence does invade my Eye? Why not one sound of Voice from you I spy? Johnny. I come to let thee know the time is now To turn, and fawn, and flatter as we do; And follow that which does too fast pursue. Be wise, neglect your Int'rest now no more; Int'rest, the Prince we serve, God we adore. I for the Royal Martyr first declar'd; But e'er his Head was off, I was prepar'd To own the Rump, and for that Cause did rhyme; But those kick'd out, next moment turn'd to him That routed 'em, call'd him my Sovereign, And prais'd his opening of the Kingly Vein. Hodge. I by my low'ring Planets was accurst To be for barren Loyalty at first: But when to Noll's our Charle's Fate gave place, I could abjure th'unhappy Royal Race. To Noll I all my Fingers skill did show, And charm'd his Highness with my nimble Bow; Besides, I serv'd him as a faithful Spy, And did decoy the Cavalierish Fry. Gold from his bounteous Highness charm'd my Eyes, My old Whore Baltinglass did not suffice For the Expence and Equipage of Spies. Johnny. Come join with us to make our Party strong, And you can never be in Bedlam long. Hodge. Where you yet madder, you might serve the State, And be employ'd in things of greatest Weight. Johnny. For, as the Turks their Fantons, we adore The Fools and Madmen, and their Aid implore. Such are the Men I sing in Panegyrick Verse: Hodge. To such I write, not to Philosophers. Porter. Such frequent Turns should you to Bedlam bring, From Rump to Cromwel, Cromwel to the King; Then to your Idol Church, next to the Pope, Which may one day prefer you to the Rope. I among Madmen am confin'd, 'tis true, But I have more Solidity than you. Johnny. A Windmill is not fickle, for we find That it is always constant to the Wind; I never change, I am still to Int'rest true; The Conqu'ror ever does my Muse subdue; And with whatever Tossing she shall meet, She, like a Cat, shall light upon her Feet. Hodge. How long did I write for the English Church, Yet now think fit to leave her in the lurch! Like Will-o-th'Wisp, th'inferior Clergy I Led into Quagmires where I let them lie: Some into Bogs and Ditches I have cast, Where let them flounder what they will, they're fast. So far Crape Gown is plung'd into the Mire, It is not possible it should retire. Porter. My Spirit boils within my troubled Breast; These Rogues are come to interrupt my Rest. Johnny. When the exalted Whigs were in their Pride, I spent my Oil and Labour on their side; Wrote a Whig Play, and Shaftesbury out-ran, For all my Maxims were Republican. For the Excluding-Bill I did declare, Libel'd and rail'd, and did not Monarch spare: When they began to droop, I fac'd about, And with my Pen I damn'd the Whiggish Rout. Nay, ev'ry turn before-hand I can find, As your sagacious Hog foresees the Wind. Hodge. You nimbly turn to that which does prevail, No Seaman e'er could sooner shift his Sail. Johnny. Like a true Renegado still I maul The Party I forsook with utmost Gaul. Hodge. So I e'er long shall damn the Heretick Souls Of my old Comrade Coffee-Priests near Paul's: Spies upon all their Pulpits I maintain, And if of Rome, or Slav'ry they complain, Or for their own against our Church do preach; I war, as if they did Sedition teach: I brand the Parson with most venomous Lyes; If I want Truth, Invention still supplies. Porter. [Aside. O Seed of Locusts! O th'infernal Lake! You'll raise my Anger, and I'll make you quake. Hodge. Long my sly Pen serv'd Rome, and I atchiev'd Ample Rewards, whole shoals of Priests deceiv'd; I wrought with such imperceptible Tools, That I of Heaps of Guineas gull'd those Fools: The only Bubbles in the World are they, Who to their Cost must feel before they see. In publick yet the English Church I own, Tho I am subtly writing of it down: For yet it is not time I shou'd declare, Lest Fools, to whom I write, shou'd be aware. Johnny. Men best themselves 'gainst open Foes defend, But perish surely by a seeming Friend. One Son turn'd me, I turn'd the other two, But had not an Indulgence, Sir, like you. I felt my Purse insensibly consume, Till I had openly declar'd for Rome. Hodge. Now Fellow-Servant, pray at length be wise, And follow our Example and Advice. Porter. What turn to Rome, who did our City burn! And would our antient Government o'erturn! Hodge. Hold! Is not th'Inscription blotted out? Porter. Therefore who burnt the City, none need doubt. Johnny. It was Almighty Fire from Heaven came down To punish the rebellious stiff-neck'd Town; All which had perish'd in devouring Flames, Tho on the Fire you'd empty'd all the Thames: Had all its Waves been on the Houses tost, It had but basted them, as they did roast. But Heav'n a Chrystal Pyramid did take. Of that a broad Extinguisher did make, In Firmamental Waters dipt above, To hood the Flames which to their Quarry strove. Porter. A Pyramid Extinguisher to hood! 'Tis Nonsense, never to be understood. Hodge. What you believe the Plot of Varlet Oates? Porter. Ten Proclamations, and four Senates Votes. Johnny. That Godfrey's Life was by the Papists sped. Porter. O no! He kill'd himself when he was dead. Hodge. To dying Jesuits will you Credit give? Porter. Yes, full as much as all the while they live. But dying Protestants I'll not believe; [Scoffingly. For they allow of neat Equivocation, And of flat Lyes with mental Reservation. Johnny. Hark Hodge! To gain him we in vain contend; Our Fellow-Servant is a Wag, dear Friend. Hodge. I'll try him farther; for his Parts are such, To bring him o'er must needs avail us much, Who are for Rome and France 'gainst English and the Dutch. Come, Fellow-Servant, you'll believe our Plot, Of Russel, Hambden, Sidney, and what not; Of Bedford, Walcot, Bow-steeple, and the Rye? Porter. For Russel would, but Hambden would not lye, Rumbald and Walcot too did both deny; Ayloffe to boot: but Cowards are not brave, For Fear's a Passion which all Cowards have. Yet to the Plot I firm Belief afford, Of th'Evidence I credit not one word. Johnny. Can you distrust what Gray and Escrick say? Porter. What two such excellent moral Men as they? Hodge. Others there are swore home as Men could do. Porter. Who for their Lives must swear, swear home, 'tis true. Against the Popish Crew none ever swore, But a full Pardon he obtain'd before. These Swearers are like Cormorants, for they On Whigs with Ropes about their Gullets prey. Johnny. What then! will you not be to Int'rest true? We both are of the same Belief with you: But we know better what we have to do. Porter. [Aside. Did ever Hell send such a Brace of Knaves? Such abject Cowards, mercenary Slaves! [Exit frowning. Johnny. His Looks are wild, his fiery Eye-balls roll, A raging Tempest's lab'ring in his Soul: Let's prudently retire.— [Porter re-enters with a great Bible given him by Nell Gwyn.] Porter. You pitiful sneaking Rogues! Would you be gone? Here's that shall knock both you and Popery down. [He knocks 'em down with the Bible, and stamps upon them: they get up.] Hodge. Rash Man! for this I full Revenge will take, And set our Evidence upon your back. Johnny. Audacious Fool! how dare you tempt your Fate, Provoking me a Pillar of the State, Who with my Pen alone have turn'd the Scale, And made the Tories o'er the Whigs prevail? Hodge. Your Pen alone?— Can I this Arrogance endure to hear? Would you usurp the Garland I should wear? Johnny. You with your Forty Eight and Forty One, With Skrews and Antipendiums plagu'd the Town: While ev'n the Whigs admir'd my lofty Verses, Your witless Prose did fodder forty A? Hodge. I'll through your A? touch Honour to the quick, And find if you have any by this Kick. [Kicks the Poet. Johnny. Kick on, old Fool, till you your Toes do gall, I have had several Kickings, and have borne 'em all: So that I'm us'd to't.— Porter. Hence, you wretched Slaves, There is Contagion in such Fools and Knaves. I'll wring your Necks off, if you ever more Presume to set your Feet within this Door: I'm Chief, and have Dominion in this place. Johnny. I'll spend my gushing Blood upon thy Face; And if thou dar'st effect thy dire Design, With my two Hands I'll fling my Head at thine. Porter. Halloo! St. Dennis, have at you. [He kicks and beats them, they run roaring out.] Johnny. Murder! murder! Hodge. Help, Murder! help! Porter. I of these Knaves shall never more complain, They have call'd back my wandring Sense again. [He pauses, and seems to come to himself.] Of all Mankind, happy alone are we, From all Ambition, from all Tumults free: No Plots, no vile Informers need we fear, No Plagues, no Tortures for Religion here. Our Thoughts, nay ev'n our very Words are free, Not damn'd by Fines, or loss of Liberty. None here's impeach'd by a vile Table Spy, Who with an Innuendo backs his Lye: Words and Lampoons we laugh at, and ne'er care What's said by Men, if Actions they forbear. Anger at Words, is Weakness understood, Since none can ridicule ought that is good: 'Tis womanish, and springs from Impotence, For no great Man at Words e'er took offence. When Rome was in her Glory, Words were free, Just Governments can never jealous be: But when to Tyranny great Rome declin'd, Weak Emperors with Delatores join'd To plague the People, and themselves undo; For when they're fear'd, they must be hated too: And whom Men hate with Ruin they'll pursue. One Witness, and a Circumstance for Facts, Is not enough; we must prove Overt-Acts. Our happy Government makes no Offence, But open and rebellious Violence; Which we to quell no standing Army need, Nor can Dragoon upon Free-quarter feed. Booted Apostles we have none, that come To knock, and beat Men to the Church of Rome. When its But-end prevails not, Torments will, For Lewis is not yet so merciful to kill. Here we, divided from the troubled World, Rest, and are into no Confusions hurl'd. For all our Wants does our wise State provide, Here ev'ry vacant Place is still supply'd, With Persons that are duly qualify'd. No Favour raises a desertless Knave, Nor Infamy, nor yet the Gold he gave. How would all Subjects envy us, should we Publish the Secrets of our Hierarchy! A Farewel to the Church of England. Go little Brat, respected by the Just, Hated by Villains, and by Papists curs'd: Thy Foes are such as Time it self shall hate, Whose horrid Actions shall compleat their Fate. Fools, Villains, Traitors, by true Names descry'd; Were ever Cards with such a Pack supply'd? But here's the Comfort, go and tell about, That Fools that put them in, will kick them out; Give thy self up, be gone, thou'rt call'd away, For Time and Tide make the whole World obey. Go tell thy Friends, and let them think upon't, A Commonwealth's the thing that some Men want. No Plots grow there, poor Mankind to abuse, Those little Tricks of State, which Monarchs use: No Cut-throats that do murder with Applause; No burning Cities to promote the Cause: No Charter seiz'd for Rome, by new-found Writ; No City Knights question'd, as they think fit, By Rogues, made Judges, to determine it. No Monster of a Mouth we e'er yet saw, Made Judg of Equity, who ne'er knew Law. No fawning Statesman, who for treach'rous Gold, His Country's Rights, and antient Freedom sold: No Judges are permitted there to live, That break the Center which the Senate give; That punish Treason under which they groan; Villains unparallel'd, excell'd by none! No trimming Poet trims with every Stream, And changes Sides as often as his Theme: No filching Justice there perks up his Head, Prefer'd to cheat the Church that gave him Bread. A snarling Cur, kept under Chain and Clog, Perform'd the Office of a wakeful Dog: Cambridg, that cry'd him up, now calls him Rogue. No Priests sit there in Council, nor debate Their juggling Politicks to plague the State; The only Curse poor England felt of late. No Burtons, Grahams, Rogues set up in spite, To squeeze and plague the People in their Right. Such Villains in a State are only fit To grace a Gallows, and hang under it. To the Haters of Popery, by what Names or Titles soever dignify'd or distinguish'd. Thus 'twas of old; then Israel felt the Rod, When they obey'd their Kings, and not their God: When they went whoring after other Loves, To worship Idols in new-planted Groves. They made their Gods of Silver, Wood and Stone, And bow'd and worship'd them when they had done. And to compleat their Sins in every way, They made the things call'd Priests; Priests, I say, A Crew of Villains more profane than they. Hence sprung the Romish Crew, that Spawn of Hell! Who now in Vice their Pedagogue excel. Their Church is rul'd by vitious Popes: the rest Are whoring Nuns, and baudy bug?ing Priests. A noble Church! daub'd with religious Paint, Each Priest's a Stallion, ev'ry Rogue's a Saint. Come you that loath this Brood, this murd'ring Crew, Your Predecessors well their Mercy knew. Take Courage now, and be both bold and wise; Stand for your Laws, Religion, and Liberties: You have the odds, the Law is still your own; They are but Traitors, therefore pull 'em down. They, struck with Fear, seek to destroy the Laws: On them, you see, they raving fix their Paws, Because from them they fear their fatal Fall, Knowing that they to death subject them all. Then keep your Laws, the Penal, and the rest, And yield your Lives rather than yield the Test. And thou, great Church of England, hold thy own, Force you they may; otherwise give up none: Robbers and Thieves must count for what they've done. Let all thy mighty Pillars now appear Zealous and brave, void both of Hate and Fear. The Popish Fops may grin, lye, cheat and whine; And curse their Faith, while all submit to thine. And you, brave Oxford, Cambridge, and the rest, Great Hough and Fairfax, who dare beard the Beast; Let all the Just with Thanks record your Name On standing Pillars of Immortal Fame. To make a Catholick Pudding. Of Oats new thresh'd at Tyburn, take two Pound, Of Chios Wine enough the same to drown: Of Malmsbury and Hobbs, take Ounces eight, Of a quack Conscience add an equal Weight: Of Juries finely pack'd, take one Ounce more, Six Irish Witnesses just come ashore. Season it all with Atheistick Lyes, 'Twill make a Pudding that shall clear your Eyes. Here Antichrist may freely treat his own Guests, For the Receipt is learned Dr. Conquest's. An Irish Prophecy. The attribution of this poem is questionable. There was a Prophecy lately found in a Bog, That Ireland should be rul'd by an Ass and a Dog: The Prophecy's true, and now come to pass; For Talbot's a Dog, and Tyrconnel's an Ass. A new Song upon the Hogen-Mogen. D'ye hear the News of the Dutch, dear Frank? Sutterkin, Hogen, Herring, van Dunk: That they intend to play us a Prank, Sutterkin, Hogen, Herring, van Dunk, Hogen Mogen, Hogen Mogen, Sutterkin, Hogen Herring van Dunk. Hogen Mogen, Hogen Mogen, &amp;c. But if they boldly dare come ashore, Sutterkin, &amp;c. Some may repent themselves full sore, Sutterkin, &amp;c. Hogen Mogen, &amp;c. For the brave English, Irish and Scotch, Sutterkin, &amp;c. Will in their Guts make such a Hotch-potch, Sutterkin, &amp;c. Hogen Mogen, &amp;c. Better they'd stuck to their Herring-Trade, Sutterkin, &amp;c. For now in Pickle themselves shall be laid, Sutterkin, &amp;c. Hogen Mogen, &amp;c.

Pass not Port-Bay, for fear it should freeze, Sutterkin, &amp;c. For then, I'fack, your Orange we'll squeeze, Sutterkin, &amp;c. Hogen Mogen, &amp;c. The Deponents. The mighty Monarch of this British Isle, Disturb'd to hear his Subjects prate and smile, That he is so content to own a Son, For to inherit th'Imperial Throne, To please his Queen, and put by both his own: But finding England not so credulous, And clear-ey'd Orange more suspect than us, By Instigation of the Q. and P. He summons all together as you see, And there declares his own Sufficiency. He says his Subjects Minds so poison'd are, They'll not believe God bless'd him with an Heir: But to convince them they are in the wrong, In comes the Swearers, and depose as long A Narrative, as perjur'd O?es could do; What these propose unquestionably's true, Our King says so, who dare say other now? There's Lords, Knights, Ladies, Squires, Quacks, and all The Papal Locusts that infect Whitehall; They swear what King would have, to gain their Ends, Since he's a Prince that ne'er forgets his Friends. But Witness Bishops, for your Loyalty He makes you great, he did bestow on ye, To keep you safe, his strongest, greatest Fort; While ye were there, the Tower was the Court. All fled from James, to you for Blessing came; Imprisonment immortaliz'd your Name: Bishops of England's Church were Men of Fame. And since his dire Designs in Law have fail'd, He seems to smile, you are to Council call'd, To hear the Worthy Loyal Swearers swear, That at the Birth of Wales's Prince they were. And first begins Old England's barren Q. Q. D??ger. That at her Sister's Labour was not seen Till all was past; yet for the Holy Cause She'll do whate'er she can to blind the Laws Of England, and doth there declare, and say, She hasten'd to the Queen that very Day, And never stirr'd till this great Prince was born, For th'Nation's Glory, but he proves their Scorn; Except of these that on him daily wait, Whose Loyal Love is only to be great. Next comes Old P?is, who a Story feigns Of Riff-raff Stuff, to fill the Peoples Brains, Of what she saw, and knew about the thing; And in a modest Circumstance doth bring, Of something which into the World he brought, And by the Doctors gave him, as she thought. Now as a Governess she tends his Grace, And would not for all Heaven quit her Place; So sweet a Babe, so fine a hopeful Lad, The forward'st Son the Father ever had. Then A?n's Countess with her Oath comes in, That at the Prince's Birth her self has been, And how she heard Complainings from the Queen Of little Pains, and then the Child was seen: But, Oh! He did not cry; the Queen baul'd out For fear 'twas dead, but Granny clear'd the Doubt. And further Honour this great Lady had; She saw Smock spoil'd with Milk (the Sign was bad.) And P?gh could not be beguil'd, Knowing the Father's Strength (at thought she smil'd) She saw Queen's Smock, and swears she was with Child. While pious Sun?nd to Chappel went On purpose to receive the Sacrament; Devotion was so great, she disobey'd Her Majesty; and said, When she had pray'd She'd wait on her: But hearing that the Prince Was hastning to the World, this, this Pretence Soon brought our Saint-like Lady quick from thence. And from her bended Knees flew to the Queen, And there saw all the Sight was to be seen. The Bed was warm'd, and into it she went, And ask'd the King if for the Guests he'd sent; And lingring Pain she had, and seem'd to fear 'Twould not be born, till all the Fools were there: But by her Midwife was assur'd, one Pain Would bring the Prince into the World amain. But faithless Queen! The Child did lie so high, She'd not believe but Judith told a Lye; And such an Honour to this Deponent granted, 'Tis hardly more by th'Pope for to be sainted. R?mon swears she stood by Sun?land, Near the Queen's Bed, just by the Midwife's Hand, And saw His Highness taken out of Bed, Fit for a Crown t'adorn his Princely Head. F?gal depos'd, that in the Queen's Distress She stood at the Beds Feet, just by M?ss; And saw the Prince into the World did come, And by D?dy carried from the Room. Then painted B?ley early in the morn Came to St. James's, to see his Highness born: With all the haste she could, she up did rise, Soon dress'd, she came by Nine a Clock precise, And found her Majesty was in the Bed, And groaning dismally, she further said, Cry'd to the Midwife, Do not the Child part: Old Granny crav'd her leave: with all her heart She granted what the Beldame did desire, And certain 'tis there was no danger nigh her: Crying, O King, where are you fled? He said, I'm kneeling, Madam, on your Bed. This plain Deponent bellows Baudy forth To be expos'd both East, West, South and North, Without e'er Fear or Shame; bars Modesty For to out-face the World with such a Lye. Then Pocky B?sis the next comes in, And says she saw the Cast of Charles's Queen; And hearing that the Q?n in Labour was, She hurry'd in without a Call or Pass. With this Excuse (she knew she was forgot) Where she talks Baudy, shews Impudence, what not? Expose her self in Print to shew her Love; Exalted by the King and one above: She'll lye and swear, forswear, to prop the Cause, That baffles England's sound and wholesom Laws. Then Lady W?grave, who was there before This Royal Babe was launched from the Shore, And heard her Majesty cry out full sore. Then C?ne and sottish Went?th say the same, With S?yer, Wal??ve, D??son, that they came And saw this Wonder which the World won't own, And blame their little Faith; to think this Son Is Spurious, and not in truth proceeding From Majesty, when they all saw him Bleeding; Nay, gave him of his Blood (squeez'd from the string) That did the Royal Babe into the World bring. Then Br?ley, T?ni, and Nan C?ry too, Swear they saw all the work that was to do, And more by half is sworn, than they'l prove true. Then comes Delabady the Great Nurse, Who with the Queen is all in all in trust; And swears that Dan?rs, Maid to Princess Anne, Was joy'd to see this little Royal Man, With former Mark on Eye, which us'd to be On all Queen Mary's Royal Progeny. James seem'd to doubt that which before he knew, And fear'd this treacherous Nurse not told him true: But he must peep and see the Royal Elf, And joy'd as if he got him his own self, For Mrs. W?ks, who doubts but she would say, She brought the Prince to Town that very day; And told the King the trembling Queen did fear 'Twould be hard Labour (tho no Child was there:) Explains most impudently those Concerns, That follow Women when they cast their Barns. And what cares she, the Hereticks she'l blind, And then we fear the King will prove most kind To all those Wretches which swear to his mind. Then comes the Washer-woman Mrs. P?ce, Who says that to the Queen she's Laundress; And there declares a Story of Hot-Linen, That us'd to come just from Child-bearing Women. Rich???nd and Li?d, and brave Ma?all, Tho not at Labour, they believe it all; And fain would be believed, if these Tools By swearing faslly could make us such Fools: They give such Demonstrations, that do lie As much aside, as they do Modesty. Then comes Great George of England, Chancellor, Who was with Expedition call'd to th'Labour: The Queen cry'd out as Women us'd to do, And he believes the Prince is real too, But not so certain, nor 'tis fear'd so true As he wears Horns, that were by M?fort made; Them and his noise makes all the Fools afraid: Tongue runs at random, and Horns pushes those, That are so Learn'd his Lordship to oppose. He fears to act no wretched Villanies, He dreads no Torments for inventing Lyes, For he of Heaven is sure whene'er he dies: Thanks to the care of fond indulgent Wife, To make atonement for his wicked Life; Damns her own Soul, and whores with all she cou'd, To allay th'impetuous Sallies of her Blood. Lord P?dent comes next, that's now cashier'd, For only speaking of the Truth 'tis fear'd; Yet he for to be great again at Court, Would be forsworn tho he be damned for't. Then A?del of W?dour, Privy Seal, Was so concern'd that he her Pains did feel; And 'tis believ'd this tender-hearted Man Did feel as much as Majesty did then; He shew'd indeed concern to mighty W?m, Who knew too much, to have concern for him: But satisfy'd the Fool it would be past, And wonder'd much her Pain so long did last. Then comes my Lord All-Pride with Modesty, And seems unwilling to affirm a Lye; With stately gesture he did himself excuse, But setting Hand to Paper can't refuse. Then Foolish C?n comes and doth depose, A Mark he hath, that he the Prince well knows; If't be his Lordship's Mark, he ne'er must rule, For Europe knows that he's mark'd for a Fool. Then in comes F?sham, that haughty Beau, And tells a tale of den, and dat, and how: Tho he's no more believ'd than all the rest, Only, poor Man, he fain would do his best; And be rewarded as when come from West. Earl of M?ray, that Alexander Great, Believes it was the King that did the feat; And that this Son is true, and not a Cheat. Then M?ton and M?ford both explain'd The business which they from the King had gain'd; As knowing Men, his Majesty did trust His Consort's Secrets, hoping they'd be just To his Endeared Son our Mighty Prince, That as he thought would hide his Impotence: G?n too, with confidence pretends It is true born, but 'tis for his own Ends. And F?x a Story tells of God knows what, To fool the Nation's all he would be at; He keeps in Favour with his Princely Grace, He fawns and flatters for to keep his place. Then famous Sca?ugh and Wi?ly, With W?ve, B?dy, and A?nd do lye; And bring their Circumstances to convince The World that 'tis a real High-born-Prince: Thus they stick out at nothing that will do The Nation wrong, and bring to England woe. Base mercenary Slaves, for a King's Smile Would Spurious Issue rear, and us beguile; That fawn on him, and more observe a Nod Than fear the Vengeance of an angry God: And on the turn o'th' times would all fly back, And let his Highness' Interest go to wreck. Two Depositions more to Council sent, Asham'd t'appear to farther the Intent Of Popish Principles, and Perjuries; None but the Devil could invent such Lyes. Then after this the King himself declares, He don't design with England to make Wars; But he such Aggravations hath of late, That he must needs be angry with the State: A specious Prologue he concludes withal; But ah! the Protestants he vows shall fall A Sacrifice to Rome, and his Revenge: Then Soldiers fear not Fools, but scorn to cringe; Be resolute and stout, and scorn to sell Your Souls to Rome, but send the Pope to Hell. A new Song on the Calling of a Free Parliament, Jan. 15, 1688/9. 1 A Parliament with one Consent Is all the Cry o'th' Nation, Which now may be, since Popery Is growing out of fashion. The Belgick Troops approach to Town, The Oranges come pouring; And all the Lords agree as one, To send the Papists scouring. 2 The holy Man shall lead the Van, Our Father and Confessor; In Robes of Red the Jesuit's fled, Who was the chief Transgressor. In this Disguise he thought t'escape, And hop'd to save his Bacon, But Herbert he has laid a Trap, The Rat may be retaken. 3 The Nuncio too the day may rue That he came o'er the Ocean, In th'English Court to keep's Resort And teach his blind Devotion. The Prelates Ellis, Smith and Hall Have sold their Coach and Horses; And will no longer in Whitehall Be making learn'd Discourses. 4 The Groom o'th'Stool that play'd the Fool Full sorely will repent it, And Sunderland did barefoot stand For Penance shall lament it. Melford and the Scotch are fled, Whom hopes of Int'rest tempted; Those Lords did turn for want of Bread, And ought to be exempted. 5 But Salisbury, what cause had he To fear his Highness' landing? Who by his A? and Legs might pass For one of Understanding. To take up Arms at such a time Against the Rules were gave him, His Head must answer for the Crime, His Pardon will not save him. 6 The Friers and Monks with all their Punks Are now upon the scamper; Tyrconnel swears, and rants and tears, And Teague does make a Clamper. The Foreign Priests that posted o'er Into the English Nation, Do now repent that on that shore They laid their weak Foundation. 7 'Twould be a sight, would move Delight In each obdurate Varlet, To see the Braves that made us Slaves, Hang in dispensing Scarlet: And every Popish Confessor That for the same Cause pleaded, Shall all turn off, on the same score Be hang'd, or else beheaded. Packington's Pound. 1 When the Joy of all Hearts, and Desire of all Eyes, In whom our chief Refuge and Confidence lies, The Protestant Bulwark against all Despair, Has depriv'd us at once of her self, and her Heir, That hopeful young thing, Begot by a King, And a Queen whose Perfections o'er all the World ring; A Father whose Courage no Mortal can daunt, And a Mother whose Virtue no Scandal can taint. 2 When Jefferies resigns up the Purse and the Mace, Whose impudent Arrogance gain'd him the Place; When, like Lucifer, thrown from the height of his Pride, And the Knot of his Villany's strangely unty'd; From the Chancery bauling He turn'd a Tarpawlin, Men still catch at any thing when they are falling: But to hasten his Fate, before he could scour, He was taken at Wapping, and sent to the Tow'r. 3 When Confessor Petre does yield up the Game, And proves to the worst of Religions a shame, When his cheating no more o'er our Reason prevails, But is blasted like that of his true Prince of Wales; Which was his Contrivance, And our wise King's Connivance To establish the Papists, and Protestants drive hence: But their Cobweb Conception is brought to the Test, And the coming of Orange has quite spoil'd the Jest. 4 When Peterborough, noted for all that is ill, Was urg'd by his Wife to the making his Will, At the hearing which words he did stare, foam and roar, Then broke out in cursing, and calling her Whore; And for two hours at least, His Tongue never ceas'd, He rail'd at Religion, and damn'd the poor Priest; And his Friends, who had hope to behold him expire, Are afraid by this Rout they shall lose their desire. 5 Young Salisbury, fam'd in this great Expedition, Not for going to War, but obtaining Commission; 'Tis no Mystery to me that his Courage did fail, When the greatest of Monarchs himself did turn tail: So if he took flight With his Betters by Night, I am apt to believe the pert Spark was i'th'right; For the Papists this Maxim do ev'ry where hold, To be forward in boasting, in Courage less bold. 6 Nor should Bellasis, Powis, nor Arundel throng, But each in due place have his Attributes sung: Yet since 'tis believ'd by the strange turn of times They'll be call'd to an account for their treasonable Crimes, While the damn'd Popish Plot Is not yet quite forgot, For which the Lord Stafford went justly to pot; And to their great comfort I'll make it appear, They that gave 'em their freedom, themselves are not clear. 7 Wi. Williams, that Friend to the Bishops and Laws, As the Devil would have it, espous'd the wrong Cause; Now loath'd by the Commons, and scorn'd by the Peers, His Patent for Honour in pieces he tears: Both our Britons are fool'd, Who the Laws over-rul'd, And next Parliament each will be plaguily school'd: Then try if your Cunning can find out a Flaw, To preserve you from Judgment according to Law. 8 Sir Neddy Hale's Actions I shall not repeat, Till by Ax or by Halter his Life he compleat; Pen's History shall be related by Lobb, Who has ventur'd his Neck for a snack in the Job: All their Priests and Confessors, With their dumb Idol-Dressers, Shall meet the Reward that is due to Transgressors; And no Papists henceforth shall these Kingdoms inherit, But Orange shall reap the Reward of his Merit. The Farewel. 1 Farewel Petre, farewel Cross; Farewel Chester, farewel Ass; Farewel Peterborough, farewel Tool; Farewel Sun?land, farewel Fool. 2 Farewel Milford, farewel Scot; Farewel Butler, farewel Sot; Farewel Roger, Farewel Trimmer; Farewel Dryden, Farewel Rhymer. 3 Farewel Brent, farewel Villain; Farewel Wright, worse than Tresilian; Farewel Chancellor, farewel Mace; Farewel Prince, farewel Race. 4 Farewel Queen, and farewel Passion; Farewel King, farewel Nation; Farewel Priests, and farewel Pope; Farewel all deserve a Rope. A Congratulatory Poem to his Royal Highness the Prince of Orange. Welcome, Great Sir, unto a drooping Isle, Whose Peace a slavish Thraldom did beguile: Whose native and just Properties infring'd, Whose Fundamental Laws are quite unhing'd; Whose Rights are in unequal Ballance weigh'd, Whose fainting Church cries out to you for Aid. Welcome thou grand Supporter of her Cause; Welcome thou great Restorer of our Laws! Wise Heav'n thought fit that You alone should be The Antidote against our Misery: That all our Wishes should in You be crown'd, That You alone should heal our bleeding Wound. You are the Rock on whom we do rely, With You we'll swim or sink, we'll live or die. You gently rule us with your awful Nod; You are our Standard, and almost our God. The State and the declining Church invite You, the vast Center of their chief Delight: They beg that you their Darkness would expel, And make a Heav'n e'en of their present Hell. 'Tis done! Rejoice, the rising Sun appears, His splendid Rays dry up our falling Tears. We'll hate the meager Looks of Sorrow now, With Laurel Leaves true Joy shall crown each Brow. You, mighty Prince, our boasting Foes subdue, And curb the Pride of all the Popish Crew. With hazard of your Life our Chains you've broke, And bravely freed us from the hated Yoke. With vast Expence you have our Freedom bought; From th'House of Bondage you our Church have brought. Hence, Jesuits, ye Instruments of Hell! Who fill with easy Souls the Devil's Cell. To cheat and gull the Ignorant's your Trade: You're subtle Devils all in Masquerade. Wretches, be gone to some more sensless Land; 'Tis Sacred, hallow'd Ground, on which you stand, And shall not be profan'd thus basely twice By such a horrid Trumpery of Vice. Hence Popery, thou Bane of all our Bliss, Thou treach'rous Pois'ner of our Happiness. Unfetter'd now, and free at last from pain, We'll never reassume thy galling Chain. Now Petre, die a Martyr for thy Church, And leave not Holy Mother in the lurch. Fly swiftly now to Heaven in a String! But first absolve your poor deluded King. What Change is this? under a strange disguise, The great Lord Wem's become George Jefferies. This is his Fate: he'll dreaded Tyburn view, And so bid Arbitrary Law adieu, And make his long-expected Dream prove true. Then Herbert, Wright, and Jenner steer their Course The same broad way as you, poor George, did yours. Then come the rest of the Fraternity, Sworn, faithful Brothers in Iniquity: For when their Captain has his Life resign'd, They, gen'rous Souls, will scorn to lag behind. Repent ye base Betrayers of your Trust, To your reproaching Consciences unjust; False to your Country, to your King untrue; Religion's but an empty Name with you. Hang now like Dogs, 'tis meet you should inherit The full and due proportion of your Merit. Justice is done! I hear Great Orange come, And with Concern pronounce your fatal Doom. England rejoice! for now your only Care Is, but the Burden of your Bliss to bear. Strip ev'ry Laurel, ev'ry Myrtle Bough, For Wreaths t'adorn and load his Sacred Brow. Echo with chearful Shouts his glorious Name, Th'amazing Wonder and Discourse of Fame. Ring Bells; a waxen Pope in Fire destroy, And shew all outward Acts of inward Joy. The Lambs do play, the Birds by Instinct sing, As if it were at the approach of Spring: And ev'ry Creature makes a Melody; Do all things else rejoice, and shall not I? I'll be the first, and will in humble Verse Your noble Deeds and glorious Acts rehearse. The Prince's Welcome to London. Hail mighty Prince! this Poem on you waits As the first Offering that celebrates Your Welcome to the Town, almost destroy'd By Priestcraft, and by You again reviv'd. This glorious Day, in which all Triumphs live, To Heav'n and You alone, Great Sir, we give. You from the Dust have rais'd our grov'ling State, Which hung upon the weakest Wheel of Fate. An Act so high, and past Mankind's believing, That none but You could e'er think of atchieving: Yet more! all who this Nation would inthral, Compleat your Triumph by their wretched Fall. But what doth Heav'n portend, that they design To act some thing that's Noble and Divine? Prophetick Stars this happy time ne'er knew, This Secret lodg'd in none but Heav'n and You. Now clear'd from sullen Frowns our Realms are blest, And in the Umbrage of your Laurels rest. While Joy, like Lightning in tempestuous Storms, Dazles the World, and fills it with Alarms. Joy now to loudest Triumph make its way, And we no diff'rence know 'tween Night and Day. Our Souls transported, in strong Raptures move, And yet united are in artless Love. Joy now and Love so very well agree, As if this Year were the Great Jubilee. To Care and Bus'ness we'll no time allow, Since deathless Laurels flourish on your Brow. Go on, brave Prince! What cannot you effect, Whom Heav'n with prosperous Stars does still protect? Let France now feel the Fury of your Sword; Rescue that Kingdom from its Tyrant Lord: Pull down his haughty Pride, too long secure, And with his impious Blood Lutetia's Plains manure. A new Song of the French King's fear of an Orange. [The First Part.] [1] Of a Hectoring Bully, Dear Muse, let me sing; Or to speak one's Mind fully, O'th' most Christian King: Who subdues Men by huffing, And converts Men by cuffing; Yet he fears if an Orange approaches too nigh, The gay Flow'r-de-Luces will wither and die. 2 He's Son to a chaste Queen, Tho, if Authors don't lye, The devout Mazarine Had a Finger i'th' Pye; To mould a Church Hero, More fierce than a Nero, Who yet fears if an Orange approaches too nigh, His gay Flow'r-de-Luces will wither and die. 3 While he's scaring his Neighbours With swelling Bravadoes, We but laugh at his Vapours And Rhodomontadoes; Tho Monseigneur the Dauphin Does new Conquests begin, Yet they dread if an Orange approaches too nigh, The gay Flow'r-de-Luces will wither and die. 4 The prodigious Advance That the Prince here has made, Makes an Earthquake in France, And great Lewis afraid. La Chaise's Address, And the Jesuits Finess, Can't hinder an Orange from approaching so nigh, That the gay Flow'r-de-Luces will wither and die. 5 If a Fury Poetick Foreknows things to come, I may dare be prophetick, And foretel his just doom: For old Nostradame Has predicted the same, That if once the brave Orange approaches too nigh, The gay Flow'r-de-Luces will wither and die. The Second Part. 1 'Tis a sport to our Prince To bridle up a King, Tho the Beast kick and wince, His firm Rider to fling; He'll make him curvet, And so steadily sit, That an Orange once planted upon the French shore, The gay Flow'r-de-Luces shall flourish no more. 2 Help, help, some kind Saint, Holy Church's two Sons: Help, thou Church Militant Of converting Dragoons. Shall Lewis Victorious, Shall Lewis the Glorious, See an Orange transplanted upon the French Shore, And his gay Flow'r-de-Luces then flourish no more? 3 Good Cæsar compound, Do but trust me once more; If I'm treach'rous found, I'm a Son of a Whore. Let us en bonne Foy, Our joint Forces employ, To stave off an Orange quite from the French Shore, Lest the gay Flow'r-de-Luces should flourish no more. 4 'Tis a cursed ill thing Makes me rave and run mad; If I were not a King, I'd my self fight I'gad: Beside, riding will pain-o My Bagpipe in Ano. Must an Orange be planted then on the French Shore, And my gay Flow'r-de-Luces thus flourish no more? 5 The wild Worm in my Tail My Vigour all drains; Through its winding Canal I've voided my Brains: And these damn'd Hereticks Have fool'd my Politicks, For an Orange once planted upon the French Shore, My gay Flow'r-de-Luces will flourish no more. Religious Relicks: or, The Sale at the Savoy, upon the Jesuits breaking up their School and Chappel. 1 Last Sunday by chance I encounter'd with Prance, That Man of upright Conversation? Who told me such News, That I could not chuse But laugh at his sad Declaration. 2 Says he, if you'll go, You shall see such a Show Of Relicks expos'd to be sold; Which from Sin and Disease Will purge all that please To lay out their Silver and Gold. 3 Strait with him I went, Being zealously bent, Where for Sixpence the Man let me in: But the Croud was so great, I was all in a Sweat, Before the rare Show did begin. 4 The Curtain being drawn, Which I think was of Lawn, The Priest cross'd himself thrice, and bow'd; Then with a sour Face, Denoting his Case, He address'd himself thus to the Croud. 5 You see our sad State, 'Tis a Folly to prate, Our Church and our Cause are a-ground; So in short, if you've Gold, Here is to be sold For a Guinea the Worth of ten Pound. 6 Here's St. James's old Bottle, It holds just a Pottle, With the Pilgrims Habit he wore; The same Scollop-shells, As our holy Church tells; Who denies it's a Son of a Whore. 7 Here's a Piece of the Bag, By Age turn'd to a Rag, In which Judas the Mony did bear; With a Part of his Rope Bequeath'd to the Pope, As an Antidote 'gainst all Despair. 8 Here's a Rib of St. Lawrence. 'Tis also at Florence, And it may be in France or in Spain; It cures Stone and Gravel, And Women in Travail, It delivers without any Pain. 9 Here's St. Joseph's old Coat, Tho scarce worth a Groat, Its Plainness does shew he'ad no Pride; Yet this he had on, For besides he had none, The Day that he marry'd his Bride. 10 His Breeches are there, A plain Leathern Pair, Come buy the whole Suit if you please: They'll defend you from th'Itch, From Hag, and from Witch, And preserve you from Bugs and from Fleas. 11 Here's the Gall of a Saint, For such as do faint, Or are troubled with Fits of the Mother; Nay, if your Breath stink Worse than Close-stool or Sink, It will cure you as soon as the other. 12 Here's a Prayer of Pope Joan, The like to't is none, If you say it but three times a year, Three hundred in Grace, And three hundred 'twill place In Heav'n, if they ever come there. 13 Here's our Lady's old Shoe, Which in old time was new, It will cure all your Chilblains and Corns; With the Coif of St. Bridget, To be worn by each Ideot, Whose Head is tormented with Horns. 14 Here's a Bottle of Tears, Preserv'd many years, Of Mary's that once was a Sinner; Some o'th' Fish and the Bread That the five thousand fed, Whom our Saviour invited to Dinner. 15 Here's St. Francis' own Cord, You may take't on my word, Who dies in it cannot be damn'd; Do but buy it, and try If I tell you a Lye, Many thousands of Heav'n are shamm'd. 16 Here's his Holiness's Beard, Of whom you have heard, That the Hereticks call'd Pope Joan; Yet this I dare swear Was his nat'ral Hair, Or else I'll be sworn he had none. 17 Its Virtue is such, That it if does touch Your Head, your Face, or elsewhere, It does straightway restore More than e'er was before, Tho by Age, or by Action worn bare. 18 Here's St. Christopher's Boot, For his right Leg and Foot, Which he wore when he ply'd at the Ferry, When on's Shoulders he bore His blessed Lord o'er, For the poor Man had never a Wherry. 19 Such as sail on the Seas, I am sure it will please, For its Parallel never was found; Neither Tempest nor Storm Can e'er do 'em harm, Nor is't possible they should be drown'd. 20 Here's an infinite more I have by me in store, All which lie conceal'd in this Hamper: Either buy 'em to-day, Or I'll throw 'em away, For to-morrow by Heaven I'll scamper. 21 Our Market is done, We must shut up at Noon, We expect 'em each hour at the door: We are hang'd if we stay, Nor can we get away, For none will dare carry us o'er. 22 But by the Faith of a Priest, This is no time to jest, Since we're baulk'd in our great Expectation: Before I will swing Like a Dog in a String, I'll renounce Transubstantiation.

The Hieroglyphick. Come, Painter, take a Prospect from this Hill, And on a well-spread Canvas shew thy Skill: Draw all in Colours as they shall appear, And as they stand in Merit place 'em there. Draw, as the Heralds do, a spacious Field, And, as directed, so let it be fill'd. First draw a Popish Army, brisk and gay, Fighting and beat, destroy'd and run away: Then draw a Herse, and let it stand in view, The Mourners more, far more than they're in shew, Cursing their Fate, their Stars; and in that Fear Shew, if thou canst, how those damn'd Sots prepare To run, to stay, and skulk in Holes alone, By 'em this Motto, Gallows, take thy own. Now to the Life let thy brisk Pencil shew Distinctly, what they are, and what's their due. Now draw a Croud of Priests prepar'd to run, Like broken Merchants when their Stock is gone. Some howling do their Pray'rs forget, and say, Save us St. Ketch: Are all our Saints away? Draw 'em in hurry, running to and fro, Posting to Dover, Portsmouth, Tyburn too. Next draw a Cloud of Lords, this Libel by; The great Design is lost. Alas! they cry, Who'd serve a Cause of such curs'd Destiny? Then draw four Priests; shew how they Rome adore, And each Man's Scarf hang to be seen before. Two Brace of Bishops fallen to Despair, Arm'd Cap-a-pe, but running God knows where. Next draw the Judges, and employ thy Skill, That all may praise thy Work, and say, 'tis well; In Caps and Gowns as they in order sate, 'Twixt Heaven and Earth do thou them elevate, For their grave Noddles can dispense with that. Last draw the little Rogues, the scoundrel Crew, Knights, Knaves, and Beggars; they must have their due, Gadbury, Butler, and wise Roger too. Amid this Croud, on a fit spot of Land, To crown the Work, let a large Gallows stand: Let them all trembling with their Guilt and Fears, Kneel to that Image, and pour out their Pray'rs, And then die by Suffocation. A Dialogue between Father Petre and the Devil. Petre. O are you come? 'tis more than time; Your Tardiness is no small Crime: All our Proceeding's at a stand, Again they've got the upper hand. Yet like true Jesuit I have wrought My Charge up to the height I sought; Both Sense and Reason quite o'erthrown, For those we deal with must have none. Devil. Is this a Conquest to relate, Worthy a Jesuitick Pate? I have more trouble with you had, Than all the Orders I have made Besides; I join'd in the Design One, whose fell Malice equals mine: One so ambitiously inclin'd, One of so uncontroul'd a Mind, That let the Gulph be ne'er so deep, Or Pyramid prodigious steep, That if in th'Extremes he can disclose Any that do his Will oppose, Tho on just Grounds, they meet their Fate In violent and unbounded Hate. Petre. I did not call you to discourse; We must do something now by Force. Our whole Society is shamm'd, And we in our first Founder damn'd. Did I, tho to my Soul's Perdition, Act things more black than my Commission? Gaining Belief among the Great, Who forc'd upon themselves the Cheat: While the good Man I kept at th'Oar, No Gally-Slave e'er labour'd more. Nor durst I let him pause upon't, Lest, if he thought, he should recant; With puzzling Notions still possess'd him, At once tormented and caress'd him: Hoodwink'd the Pilot that should steer us, With our infallible Chimeras. Devil. Boast not as if you'ad Conquest won; You've started much, but nothing done. Your Order, wheresoe'er they came, Have set whole Kingdoms in a flame: Nor Hell, nor Rome, can give you thanks, For acting thus a Madman's Pranks. Did I not always to you preach, The English would you over-reach? They'll be convinc'd e'er they believe, Not pin their Faith upon your Sleeve. Your publick Chappels have o'erthrown us, Our very Proselytes disown us, And face about to t'other side, Exclaiming 'gainst the Roman Pride. Petre. What! do you now complain of me, For overacting Villany? I still consulted you in all, Did daily for your Conduct call: And tho, 'tis true, I nam'd the Saints, Yet 'twas to you I made my Plaints. I own about the French we fail'd, But in the Irish we prevail'd. Propose once more and I'll obey't, It shall be done if you but say't. You know in such a holy Juggle, That my sear'd Conscience ne'er did boggle. We must not flag, nor sit down here, That would betray Remorse or Fear; Which Jesuits do more decline, Than e'er the Rechabites did Wine. But I have something to impart, Which does oppress my tender Heart; And made me now invoke you hither, Tho 'gainst your Principles, to gather The Truth of these important Queries, So needful in this dubious Series. First, if in your power it lie, Tell me what Death I'm doom'd to die; I dare not hope, 'twill be in Bed, That sutes not with the Life I've led. But if I must be hang'd and quarter'd, Let me be canoniz'd and martyr'd, With holy Harcourt and his Fellows, Like them be sainted at the Gallows. And next I do the Favour crave, Since I have ever been your Slave; Unfold the Mystick Book of Fate, And read me England's future State: Which next shall to the Throne succeed, The English or Italian Breed. The Devil answ'ring, laugh'd outright; Would I these Secrets bring to light, I should not half that Harvest gain, For which I've taken all this Pain. Nor would I, if I could, reveal That which my Int'rest bids conceal. Yet I will answer thee in part, Since I've a Title in thy Heart. The first peculiar is to thee; For which thou need'st not trouble me, 'Tis long since thou didst it foresee. Not is it reason to believe, Thou should'st the Mobile deceive. But whether Martyr, or as Traitor, Thy Ballad will be Truth's Relator. The Consequence of th'other draw, By the Success of Great Nassau. This said, the Devil left the Father, The Meaning of his Words to gather; And vanish'd from him down the Stairs, While he proceeded in his Pray'rs. The Rise and Fall of the Lord Chancellor. To the Tune of, Hey brave Popery! Good People, pray now attend to my Muse, I'll sing of a Villain I cannot abuse, The Halter and Ax no such Men will refuse: Sing hey brave Chancellor! O fine Chancellor! Delicate Chancellor! O! 'Tis he was the Cause of the Nation's Dismay, He has e'er been a Knave from his Birth to this Day, To see the Sot hang'd we will make Holy-day. Sing hey, &amp;c. At first I will shew you what he is in grain, I care not a pin for his Honour's Disdain; His Deeds now in brief unto you I'll proclaim: Sing hey, &amp;c. He was the Inventor of Oates's Punishment From Newgate to Tyburn, and thither he sent; To have him well whip'd he gave his consent. Sing hey, &amp;c. The good Master Cornish did innocent die, And all by this Chancellor's curs'd Villany; His Blood now to Heav'n for Vengeance does cry, Sing hey, &amp;c. He was the first Author that open'd his Jaws To take off the Test and the Penal Laws: Of beheading Lord Russel he alone was the Cause. Sing hey, &amp;c. Then next to the West he hurry'd with speed, To murder poor Men, a very good Deed! He made many honest Mens Hearts for to bleed. Sing hey, &amp;c. The Prisoners to plead to his Lordship did cry, But still he made answer, and thus did reply, We'll hang you up first, and then after we'll try. Sing hey, &amp;c. Against their Petitions then he stopt his Ears, And still did create all their Doubts and their Fears; He left the poor Widows and Children in Tears. Sing hey, &amp;c. He was the Inventor that first did promote The Place that was call'd th'Ecclesiastical Court, And thither he made the poor Clergy resort. Sing hey, &amp;c. Of Magdalen-College he thought it most fit To turn out the Fellows, a very fine Trick, And place Father Walker, that curst Jesuit. Sing hey, &amp;c. Then next to the Tower our Bishops he pack'd, And swore he had done a very good Act, But now shall be try'd for the Matter of Fact. Sing hey, &amp;c. And when that the Bishops were brought to be try'd, To prefer a Petition they humbly desir'd, He swore he would prove it a Libel to be cry'd. Sing hey, &amp;c. What can he say now the Parliament sits? Alas! they will vote him quite out of his Wits, They'll make him run mad, or fall into Fits. Sing hey, &amp;c. In Wapping he thought for to make his Escape, A very good Jest, but I'faith it won't take, His Head on the Bridg must be stuck on a Stake. Sing hey, &amp;c. He many seditious Libels hath pen'd, And sent them to P? his very good Friend, My Muse she grows weary, and thus she does end, With Pox o'th' Chancellor, villanous Chancellor, damnable Chancellor, O! A Letter to the Lord Chancellor. My Lord, I'd praise your Lordship, but you've had your share Of that before, if not too much by far; And now a nobler Field for Cursing does appear. Yet I'll not curse, but leave you to the Croud, Who never baulk their Rage, but speak aloud; Thro all the Labyrinths of your Crimes they'll track you, Worse than ten thousand Furies they'll attack you. We talk not here of Penal Laws, or Test, Nor how you, King of Terrors in the West, With more than savage Cruelty oppress'd Those whose thin Shades now stab your anxious Breast: To those I leave you; each with brandish'd Dart Will home revenge his Quarrel at your Heart: For me, I'll only let your Lordship see How they resent your chang'd Felicity. Now may you hear the People as they scour Along, not fear to damn the Chancellor. The Women too, and all the tender Crew, That us'd to pity all, now laugh at you: The very Boys, how they do grin and prate, And giggle at the Bills upon your Gate! Nay, rather than be frustrate of their Hope, The Women will contribute for a Rope: And those fine Locks, that no gay Spark might touch, On this account Ketch may, they love my Lord so much. O for Dispensing now! Ay, now's the time! Your Eloquence can hardly blanch your Crime: And all the Turnings of your Protein Wit, With all your little Tricks won't help a bit: Nay, that smooth Tongue, in which your chiefest Trust is, Now can't, altho it sometimes baffled Justice. No Ignoramus Juries shall perplex you, But with their Billa vera's now shall vex you: From their dire Claws no hiding Hole you'll find, They now will speak their own, and not a Party's Mind. Not now, as heretofore, when on the Bench. Flattery and Daubing had such Influence, And Jefferies for a Bribe would with the Laws dispense. But granting all our Laws are out of joint, They fear not still but they shall gain the Point: A High Commission may the Cause decide; Your Lordship by a Butcher may be try'd, When by Commission he is dignify'd, His Pow'r you must not doubt, if he be satisfy'd: Of Laws like this we have a Precedent, Nought will't avail t'appeal to a Parliament; For they are such damn'd Sticklers for the Laws, That it is five to one you lose your Cause. You see, my Lord, the Case is very sad, Enough to make a wiser Man stark mad: But I'll advise your Wisdom what to do; 'Tis plain, that they their Madness will pursue: They hope to see you soon advanc'd on high, Most sweetly dangling 'twixt the Earth and Sky. This 'tis they mean, 'tis this they would have done, But I would chouse 'em ev'ry Mother's Son: Troth I'd e'en hang my self; 'tis quickly done. For why should such a Man as you submit To be the publick Laughter of each grinning Cit? Else a keen Rasor take, and never fear, To cut your Lordship's Throat from Ear to Ear; 'Tis feasible enough, you know who did it, And you are valiant, therefore never dread it: Fail not to make sure work on't if you can, Else Essex will be thought the stouter Man. Sir Thomas Jenner's Speech to his Wife and Children. Dear Wife let me have a Fire made, I'll tell you such News will make you all glad, The like for another is scarce to be had: This it is to be learned and witty. First, Butler, do you a Glass of Wine bring: I'll tell you all the great Love of my King, Which is a dainty curious fine thing. This it is, &amp;c. A wise learned Serjeant at Law I was made, And a dainty fine Coif was put on my Head, Which is heavier by far than a Hundred of Lead. This it is, &amp;c. But soon after this I was made the Recorder, To keep the worshipful Rabble in order, And wore a Red Gown with long Sleeves and Border. This it is, &amp;c. What Justice I did, my dear Wife, you can tell; Right or wrong I spar'd none, like the Devil in Hell, But guilty or not, I sent all to Bridewel. This it is, &amp;c. Unless it were those that greased my Fist, To them I gave Licence to cheat whom they list, For it was only those my Mittimus miss'd. This it is, &amp;c. But then the King dy'd, which caus'd a Pother, So I went to condole with the new King his Brother, With Sorrow in one Hand, and Grief in the other. This it is, &amp;c. For an ignorant Judg I was call'd by the King To the Chequer Court, 'tis a wonderful thing, Of which in short time the whole Nation did ring. This it is, &amp;c. By Great James I was rais'd to the Common-Pleas Bench, 'Cause he saw I had exquisite Politick Sense, Which his Wisdom perceiv'd in the Future Tense. This it is, &amp;c. At Sarum five hundred Pounds I have gotten, To save Malefactors from swinging in Cotton, For which they were hang'd and are now almost rotten. This it is, &amp;c. But now, my dear Love, comes the Cream of the Jest, For the King would take off the Oaths and the Test, Which I told all his People would be for the best. This it is, &amp;c. He had my Opinion that 'twas in his power To destroy all the Laws in less time than an hour, For which I may chance to be sent to the Tower. This it is, &amp;c. And now to Magdalen College I come, Where we have turn'd out most, but kept in some, That so a new College of Priests might have room. This it is, &amp;c. And so by that means we left the Door ope, To turn out the Bishops, and let in the Pope, For which we have justly deserved a Rope. This it is to be learned and witty. Popery pickled: Or, The Jesuits Shoes made of running Leather. To the Tune of, Would you be a Man of Favour. 1 Would you have a new Play acted? Would you see it just begun? Popery is run distracted, And the Priests are all undone. Now you'll see their Beads and Crosses All lie prostrate on the ground; They're march'd off like Fools and Asses, Not one Skulker to be found. 2 Would you see the Great Ones flying, Leaving a disbanded Court? There are Monks and Friars crying, Whither now shall we resort? Now the Chappel's quite defeated, And forsaken like the Crown: Popery is now convicted, There's no such thing to be found. 3 Would you see the Priests recanting, Now they fear the English Law? You shall hear them all a ranting, Lero, Lero, Bullen-a-la. Instead of reading Ave-Mary In their Babylonian Gown, You will see the quite contrary, Not a Mass-Book to be found. 4 Would you see the Nest a brooding, Which way they their Course shall steer? You shall hear them all concluding, Any where but staying here. Jefferies was prepar'd for sailing In his long Tarpawlin Gown; But his Politicks him failing, By his bauling he was found. 5 Would you see Tyrconnel sweating For fear of a final Rout? Now the great Convention's sitting, All will soon be brought about. He must then forsake his Palace, Just as Petre did his Gown; Like a Coward fly to Calais, Where he never may be found. 6 Would you have the Scene now changed, Stay but while this Act is done, And see Father Petre hanged For procuring of a Son? See the Chancellor a pleading, Where he Russel guilty found? When he hears his Sentence reading, A true Dreamer he'll be found. Song. [The Pillars of Popery now are blown down] To the Tune of Lilli-Burlero. 1 The Pillars of Popery now are blown down, One thousand six hundred eighty and eight, Which has frighten'd our Monarch away from his Crown, One thousand six hundred eighty and eight. For Myn Heer did appear, and they scamper'd for fear, One thousand six hundred eighty and eight: For Myn Heer did appear, and they scamper'd for fear, One thousand six hundred eighty and eight. 2 That Mirror of Mothers, and Wonder of Wives, One thousand, &amp;c. With her Joy of three Titles are fled for their Lives. One thousand, &amp;c. 3 George Jefferies, who boasted his Face was of Brass, One thousand, &amp;c. Is now metamorphos'd into a Welch Ass. One thousand, &amp;c. 4 That Curse of three Kingdoms, damn'd Petre, is fled, One thousand, &amp;c. Who with Rome's Ignis fatuus our Monarch misled. One thousand, &amp;c. 5 Great Dada, whose Presence made pregnant the Queen, One thousand, &amp;c. Now she has withdrawn, is no more to be seen. One thousand, &amp;c. 6 Old Mordant's good Service shall doubly be paid, One thousand, &amp;c. For his fetching the Queen now his Lordship is staid, One thousand, &amp;c. 7 That Sink of Sedition, the vile Observator, One thousand, &amp;c. Shall receive the just Merit that's due to a Traitor. One thousand, &amp;c. 8 Our Renegade Rhymer, tho cudgel'd and lick'd, One thousand, &amp;c. For his Hind and his Panther shall once more be kick'd. One thousand, &amp;c. 9 Now old Obadiah quits Ave-Maria, One thousand, &amp;c. To sing Lamentations worse than Jeremiah. One thousand, &amp;c. 10 That Wittal and worse, who commanded the Tow'r, One thousand, &amp;c. With that shrimp of a Soldier sweet Cecil did scour. One thousand, &amp;c. 11 All our Priests are gone back with our Jesuits and Monks, One thousand, &amp;c. And our Nuns to their former Profession of Punks. One thousand, &amp;c. 12 'Twould tire your Patience to number the rest, One thousand, &amp;c. You may guess by the Paw at the Bulk of the Beast. One thousand, &amp;c. Tarquin and Tullia. In Time when Princes cancel'd Nature's Law, And Declarations, which themselves did draw; When Children us'd their Parents to dethrone, And gnaw'd their way like Vipers to a Crown: Tarquin, a savage, proud, ambitious Prince, Prompt to Expel, yet thoughtless of Defence; The envy'd Scepter did from Tullius snatch, The Roman King, and Father by the Match. To form his Party, Histories report, A Sanctuary was open'd in his Court, Where glad Offenders safely might resort. Great was the Croud, and wond'rous the Success; (For those were fruitful Times of Wickedness) And all that liv'd obnoxious to the Laws Flock'd to Prince Tarquin, and embrac'd his Cause. 'Mong these a Pagan Priest for refuge fled, A Prophet deep in godly Faction read; A Sycophant that knew the modish Way To Cant and Plot, to Flatter and Betray; To Whine and Sin, to Scrible and Recant: A shameless Author, and a lustful Saint. To serve all Times he could Distinctions coin, And with great ease flat Contradictions join: A Traytor now, once Loyal in extreme, And then Obedience was his only Theme; He sang in Temples the most Passive Lays, And weary'd Monarchs with repeated Praise: But manag'd aukardly that lawful part; For to vent Lyes and Treason was his Art, And pointed Libels at Crown'd Heads to dart. This Priest, and others, learned to defame, First murder'd injur'd Tullius in his Name, With blackest Calumnies their Sov'reign load, A poison'd Brother, and dark League abroad; A Son unjustly topt upon the Throne, Which yet was prov'd undoubtedly his own: Tho, as the Law was there, 'twas his behoof, Who dispossest the Heir, to bring the Proof. This hellish Charge they back'd with dismal Frights, The loss of Property and Sacred Rights, And Freedom; Words which all false Patriots use, The surest Names the Romans to abuse: Jealous of Kings, and always Malecontent, Forward to change, yet certain to repent. Whilst thus the Plotters needful Fears create, Tarquin with open Force invades the State; Leud Nobles join him with their feeble Might, And Atheist Fools for dear Religion fight: The Priests their boasted Principles disown, And level their Harangues against the Throne: Vain Promises the People's Minds allure; Slight were their Ills, but desperate their Cure. 'Tis hard for Kings to steer an equal Course; And they who banish one, oft get a worse. Those Heav'nly Bodies we admire above, Do every day irregularly move. Yet Tullius, 'tis decreed, must lose his Crown, For Faults that were his Council's, not his own; He now in vain commands e'en those he paid; By darling Troops deserted and betray'd; By Creatures which his genial Warmth had made. Of these a Captain of the Guards was worst, Whose Memory to this Day stands accurst: This Rogue advanc'd to Military Trust, By his own Whoredom, and his Sister's Lust; Forsook his Master after dreadful Vows, And plotted to betray him to his Foes: The kindest Master to the vilest Slave, As free to give, as he was sure to crave. His haughty Female, who, as Books declare, Did always toss wide Nostrils in the Air; Was to the younger Tullia Governess, And did attend her when, in borrow'd dress, She fled by Night from Tullius in distress. This Wretch by Letters did invite his Foes, And us'd all Arts her Father to depose: A Father always generously bent, So kind, that he her Wishes did prevent. 'Twas now high time for Tullius to retreat, When ev'n his Daughter hast'ned his defeat; When Faith and Duty vanish'd, and no more The Name of Father, nor of King he bore: A King! whose Right his foes could ne'r dispute, So mild! that Mercy was his Attribute; Affable, kind, and easy of Access, Swift to relieve, unwilling to oppress; Rich without Taxes, yet in payment just; So honest that he hardly could distrust: His active Soul did ne'er from Labours cease; Valiant in War, and sedulous in Peace: Studious with Traffick to enrich the Land; Strong to protect, and skilful to command: Liberal and Splendid, not without Excess; Loth to revenge, and willing to caress. In sum, How Godlike must his Nature be, Whose only Fault was too much Piety! This King remov'd, th'assembled States thought fit That Tarquin in the Vacant Throne should sit; Voted him Regent in their Senate-House, And with an empty Name endow'd his Spouse, The elder Tullia, who some Authors feign, Drove o'er her Father's Corps a trembling Wain: But she! more guilty! numerous Wains did drive, To crush her Father, and her King alive; In glad remembrance of his hast'ned Fall, Resolv'd to institute a weekly Ball. She! jolly Glutton! grew in Bulk and Chin; Feasted in Rapine, and enjoy'd her Sin; With Luxury she did weak Reason force, Debauch'd Good-nature, and cram'd down Remorse: Yet when she drunk cool Tea in lib'ral Sups, The sobbing Dame was Maudlin in her Cups. But brutal Tarquin never did relent, Too hard to melt, too wicked to repent; Cruel in Deeds, more merciless in Will, And blest with natural Delight in Ill; From a wise Guardian he receiv'd his Doom, To walk the Change, and not to govern Rome; He swore his Native Honours to disown, And did by Perjury ascend the Throne: Oh! had that Oath his swelling Pride represt! Rome then had been with Peace and Plenty blest. But Tarquin, guided by destructive Fate, Wasted the Country, and embroil'd the State: Transported to their Foes the Roman Pelf, And by their Ruin hop'd to save himself. Innumerable Woes opprest the Land, When it submitted to his curst Command. So just was Heaven, that 'twas hard to tell, Whether its Guilt or Losses did excel. Men who renounc'd their God, for dearer Trade, Were then the Guardians of Religion made: Rebels were fainted; Foreigners did reign; Outlaws return'd Preferments to obtain, With Frogs and Toads, and all their croaking Train: No Native knew their Features, nor their Birth, They seem'd the greasy Offspring of the Earth; The Trade was sunk, the Fleet and Army spent, Devouring Taxes swallow'd lesser Rent; Taxes impos'd by no Authority, Each leud Collection was a Robbery. Bold self-creating Men did Statutes draw, Skill'd to establish Villany by Law; Fanatick Drivers, whose unjust Careers Produce new Ills, exceeding former Fears. Yet Authors here except that Faithful Band, Which the prevailing Faction did withstand; And some who bravely stood in the defence Of baffled Justice, and their Injur'd Prince: These shine to after-Times, each Sacred Name Stands still recorded in the Books of Fame. SONG. [The Gospel and Law allow Monarchs their due] The Gospel and Law allow Monarchs their due, If rightfully crown'd and anointed; The Lawyers are Rebels, and Clergymen too, On the Bench to defy, And in Pulpit deny, Whom the Lord and the Laws have appointed. The Courts are corrupted, and so are the Schools, And Truth lies condemn'd as a Culprit; The Bench is invested by Traytors and Fools, And the Devil's crept into the Pulpit. Then who'd in this Age go to Law or to Church, Since Justice in both is so common an Evil? Truth is made Treason, By Law without Reason; And the Clergy that left their poor Prince in the lurch, Will send their poor Souls to the Devil. On the Promotion of Dr. T? to the See of Ca?ry. When Nebat's fam'd Son undertook the old Cause, Of delivering ten Tribes from Slavery to Laws; Lest the Job should be spoil'd, or done but by halves, He took his Priests from the Mob, and his God from the Calves. But our Hero more wise, the Deliverers outvy'd all, Made a Calf the High-Priest, and himself the Calf's Idol. A Congratulatory Poem to King William, on his Return from Ireland, 1690, after the Battel of the Boyne. 1 Welcome, Great Monarch, to the Throne we gave! A mean Reward for those you came to save; And yet in That we gave you all we have. 2 The Gods our Offerings ne'er the more do prize, When Clouds of Smoke obscure their brighter Skies; A grateful Heart commends the Sacrifice. 3 We'll spare no labour to enlarge your State, And do not yet our forwards Pains regret, Tho disappointed Kindness turns to Hate. 4 You have enough your Skill in Battel shown, Your Courage and your Conduct all must own; Pray let your Foresight once at home be known. 5 In open Field with open Foes you've met, Take either side it is an equal Bet; But here your Enemies dance in a Net. 6 Your Valour shone, when you your Army led, And dar'd the numerous Foe with Colours spread; But where's your Guard against an Ambuscade? 7 Your handy-work does all Mankind surprize, Each fresh Remembrance still new Praise supplies; But pray, Sir, let us once adore your Eyes. 8 You've Enemies in private, who beset Your Path to Glory, undiscover'd yet; And till you've conquer'd them, you'l ne'er be great. 9 No End you'l find to your laborious Work, (Tho with the Irish you could rout the Turk) While Gallick Locusts in your Councils lurk. 10 Wherefore to Foreign Dyets shou'd you go, To undertake a Task you can't go thro, While those at home unravel all you do? 11 Unkennel those State-Foxes first, who spoil And counterwork the Virtue of your Toil, And Heaven it self shall on your Labour smile. 12 Let proud C?n your just Vengeance find, And N?m to his Behaviour bind; 'Tis unsafe marching with two Foes behind. 13 Teach L? how to mind his Diocess, To make his Parish-Priests and Curates wise, And not presume to give the Queen Advice. 14 Let not the Men, who would your Wants supply With Blood and Mony, unregarded lie, Because a self-advancing Fop cries, Fie! E. of P?d. 15 Nor let your self be so impos'd upon, To fancy those were Commonwealths-men grown, Who tugg'd so hard to place you on the Throne; 16 On whose Support the Monarchy relies, Who have no other Aim before their Eyes, But that your Greatness with their Wealth may rise. 17 When these and some few other things are done, Your growing Glory like the Rising Sun, Shall (bright as that) an endless Circuit run. 18 To certain Conquests your swift Arms shall speed, From those debarring Remora's once freed; You shall want nothing that you truly need, Our Purses and our Veins shall freely bleed. The Pensioners. The attribution of this poem is questionable. Let noble Sir Positive lead the Van, That only all-doing unerrable Man, What pity it is that his Life's but a Span?

Honest Friend, here's my Hand, you'll be welcome at Hell, And shall have all my Custom who pay very well. The Cobler star'd hard at his Garter and Star, Quoth he, since your Highness condescendeth so far, For I am not us'd to see Dukes at my Door, Tho your Wife and your Daughter have call'd here before, I promise my Vote if you'll tell me the Case, Wherein a poor Mouse could so anger your Grace. You must know I had taken some Gold on account Of my Favours, or so, as Courtiers are wont; And this Rogue 'mong the rest did make such a pother, In bawling for Justice from one House to t'other, They fairly at last put my Friend in the Pound: That's hard! Nay, what's worse, they made me refund. But you had it again? Not a Groat by my troth; Indeed nay, your Grace has cause to be wroth. But yet, an't shall please you, I wish you prevail: The Vagabonds scorn your roast Beef and your Ale. But sure they remember what things have been done For this Nation by me, my Wife, and my Son. You know, I suppose, I marry'd the King? No indeed, tho your Chaplain talks much of the thing: But my Lord, shall I tell you my Mind very plain, And they say you love Truth; you tap Ale in vain, For the Squire will out-poll us, and peach you again. SONG. [What a de'el is the Stir we make with War] What a de'el is the Stir we make with War, To confound our Estates for Ambition; With a crafty Pretence of conquering France, To drill out the Coin of the Nation? 'Twere a muckle thing to exchange our King; Lubberloons have got well by the Barter: For th'acute valiant Prince takes the Forlorn of France As the stout bonny Scot took the Tartar. De'el faum mine Eyen if e'er I seen Sike a Parcel of Loons in the Nation, Since the Lord of the Boyne has cost us more Coin, They repent of their gude Abdication. For the Loons of the Kirk do now find the Work Were a Muckle for their Purses: And the War that's begun by the good valiant Son Shall be crown'd with a Trophy of Curses. SONG. [Ye Members of Parliament all] [1] Ye Members of Parliament all, That quarrel to settle the Nation, Prepare an Address for White-hall, And give thanks for your King's Preservation. 2 Last Sunday to Chappel he went, To hear a sweet Nightingal sing; God knows whether Treason was meant, But there happen'd a damnable thing. 3 To the Window his Majesty came To shew his desirable Face; When a Lord, whom I list not to name, Unluckily slipt the Sash. 4 The Portcullice come ratling down, And threatned the Noddle anointed Lord! how the blue Bishop would frown, To see all his Hopes disappointed. 5 Count Landsdown, who gravely stood by, A snuffing up Politick Powder, To his Sovereign's Assistance did fly, A Pox on the Loyal Intruder, 6 For had he but let him alone, Our Protector had safely been lock'd there, And in Pillory Penance had done, Like his Brother-Deliverer the Doctor. 7 Such an Engine in Scotland is known, And thither he's going 'tis said: But 'tis thought while he snaps at the Crown, The Maiden may snap off his Head. 8 Never let Over?que boast Of saving so puny a thing; He preserv'd but a?at most: 'Twas Landsdown deliver'd the King. Epitaphium in Vice-Comitem Dundee. English'd by Mr. Dryden. O last and best of Scots! who didst maintain Thy Country's Freedom from a Foreign Reign: New People fill the Land now thou art gone, New Gods the Temples, and new Kings the Throne. Scotland and thou did each in other live, Thou wouldst not her, nor could she thee survive. Farewel! who living didst support the State, And couldst not fall but with thy Country's Fate. O Raree Show! O Pretty Show! Or, The City-Feast. On a Day of great Triumph, when Lord of the City Does swear to be honest and just, as he's witty; And rides thro the Town, that the Rabble may shout him, For the wonderful Merits he carries about him; Being an honester Man, I'll be bold for to say, Than has sat in the Chair this many a day: Like the rest of the Fools from the Skirts of the Town, I trotted to gaze at his Chain and his Gown, With Legs in a Kennel quite up to the middle In Dirt; with a Stomach as sharp as a Needle, I stood in the Cold clinging fast to a Stump, To see the Wiseacres march by in their Pomp: At last heard a Consort of Trumpets and Drums, And the Mob crying out, Here he comes, here he comes. I was carry'd by the Croud from the Place that I stood in, And the Devil to do there was all of a sudden: The first that appear'd was a great Tom-a-Doodle, With a Cap like a Bushel to cover his Noddle, And a Gown that hung draggling thro every Puddle; With a Sword and a Mace, and such Pageantry Pride, And abundance of formal old Foppery beside. A Troop of grave Elders, O then there came by, In their Blood-colour'd Robes, of a very deep Dye, On Jennets the best that the Town could afford, As tame all as Lambs, and as fine as my Lord: With very rich Saddles, gay Bridles and Cruppers, Would ne'er have been made but for such City-Troopers: Like Snails o'er a Cabbage they all crept along, Admir'd by their Wives, and huzza'd by the Throng. The Companies follow'd, each Man in his Station, Which ev'ry Fool knows is worth Observation, All cloth'd in Furs in an antient Decorum, Like Bears they advanc'd, with their Bagpipes before 'em; With Streamers and Drums, and abundance of fooling, Not worth the repeating, or yet ridiculing; So I'll bid adieu to the Tun-belly'd Sinners, And leave 'em to trudg thro the Dirt to their Dinners. At last I consider'd 'twas very foul Play, That a Poet should fast on a Festival-Day: I therefore resolv'd it should cost me a Fall, But that I would drink my Lord's Health at a Hall. For why may'nt a Poet, thought I, be a Guest, As welcome as Parson, or Fool at a Feast, For the sport of a Tale, or the sake of a Jest? I mix'd with the Musick, and no one withstood me, And so justled forward as clever as could be: I pass'd to a very fine Room thro a Porch; 'Twas as wide as a Barn, and as high as a Church, Where Cloths upon Shovel-board Tables were spread, And all things in order for Dinner were laid; The Napkins were folded on ev'ry Plate, Into Castles and Boats, and the Devil knows what: Their Flaggons and Bowls made a very fine show, And Sweetmeats, like Cuckolds, stood all in a row. They walk'd, and they talk'd; after some Consultation The Beadle stood up, and he made Proclamation, That no one presume, of a Member, till after He'as din'd, to bring in his Wife or his Daughter. Then in come the Pasties, the best of all Food, With Pig, Goose, and Capon, and all that was good: Then Grace soon was said, without any delay, And as hungry as Hawks they sat down to their Prey. The Musick struck up, such a Boree advancing, As the Polanders pip'd, when their Cubs were a dancing. Then each tuck'd his Napkin up under his Chin, That his Holiday Band might be kept very clean; And pinn'd up his Sleeves to his Elbows, because They should not hang down, and be greas'd in the Sauce. Then all went to work, with such rending and tearing, Like a Kennel of Hounds on a Quarter of Carr'on. When done with the Flesh, then they claw'd off the Fish, With one Hand at Mouth, and the other in Dish. When their Stomachs were clos'd, what their Bellies deny'd, Each clap'd in his Pocket to give to his Bride; With a Cheese-cake and Custard for my little Johnny, And a handful of Sweetmeats for poor Daughter Nanny. Then down came a Blade, with a Rattle in's Skull, To tickle their Ears when their Bellies were full: After three or four Hems to clear up his Voice, At every Table he made them a noise Of twenty four Fidlers were all in a row; Tho the Singer meant Cuckolds, I'd have 'em to know: Then London's a gallant Town, and a fine City, 'Tis govern'd by Scarlet, the more is the pity. When Claret and Sack had troul'd freely about, And each Man was laden within and without: The Elders arising, all stagger'd away, And in sleeping like Hogs spent the rest of the Day. Answer to a Poem intitled, A Panegyrick, written in the Year 1691/2, and printed in the second Volume of State-Poems, Pag. 401. Hail happy William! thou art truly Great: The Cause? 'Tis Virtue justify'd by Fate. For Thee the Parents and their Children sing; Without Desert thou art no Favourite King. For Thee the Patriot will maintain the Laws, For Thee just Judges will decide the Cause. Prelates thou'st made cannot the Church betray; Thy Soldiers fight for Principle, not Pay. By Thee the Freeman's fix'd in his Freehold, Misers may spend, or else increase their Gold. By Thee the Merchant multiplies his Store, By Thee the Tradesman is content, not poor. For Thee the Senate useless Laws suspends, And good ones makes for thine and England's Ends. The chief Design of all their well-weigh'd Votes, Is to invent new Ways, new Means, to damn new Plots. Thine and thy People's Credit join'd, must pass; But that, and Mony, not without thy Face. Slav'ry and Oppression thou maintain'st no more, Than Wealth and Liberty the Kings before. For thee 'gainst Tyranny they all declare, And only for old England like the War. Why should this Wonder then so wondrous seem, When all that's good and kind thou'lt do for them? Rebels and Witches ne'er sign'd William's Rolls: Those that oppose his Reign, must damn their Souls. Upon a Medal, whereon two Names were interwoven. This mystick Knot unites two Royal Names, Victorious Lewis, and long-suffering James; Pious and stout Assertors of the Cross, Whether it be by Conquest, or by Loss: Their Glory's equal, different their Fate; Laurels on one, Palms for the other wait. P. of O's Atchievements in Flanders, in the Years 91 and 92. The Author sure must take great pains, Who pretends to write his Story; In which of these two last Campaigns He'as acquir'd greatest Glory: For while that he march'd on to fight, Like Hero, nothing fearing, Namur was taken in his sight, And Mons within his hearing. EUCHARISTICON: Or an Heroick Poem upon the late Thanksgiving-Day, which was the Vigil or Fast of St. Simon and St. Jude. 'Twas on the Evening of that Day, That very memorable Day, The twenty seventh of October, When none but Jacobites were sober, That we beheld the Blessed Sight Of glorious Eucharistick Light. But that the Morn we may not wrong, Which usher'd in the Evening Song; Nor th'Infant Day which grew so great, After it was regenerate And re-baptiz'd by Proclamation, And call'd Thanksgiving-day o'th' Nation; We shall relate all that was done In open Face of Moon and Sun. But, first, 'tis fit that we rehearse, In bold, but grave Heroick Verse, Why a Thanksgiving-day was chose, What were the Reasons, what the Cause; And why it was resolv'd, at last, They'd not proclaim this Day a Fast. First, To the First we should begin, And the Supports bring after in; But since Supporting's out of fashion, By the Wise, Warlike, Belgick Nation; The Rear shall take the Advance Post, And shew you how the Fast was lost. In Council grave our Senators were met About th'important Business of the State; Bus'ness so weighty, that all Europe stood, Hoping from hence the Stream of all their Good; Great Things were mov'd, and mighty Kingdoms flew, Like sporting Bubbles, round the God-like Crew: They pufft those Cares away; but fell, at last, Upon the Bus'ness of the Monthly Fast: The great Debate was this, Whether 'twas fit They should for longer time continue it? Or else adjourn; or else prorogue the Day; Or throw their Pray'rs and Fastings quite away? To this hard knotty Question, it was said, By a most Grave and Venerable Head, That the Descent was balk'd, and Namur won, And the Campaign in all appearance done; That Heaven could not be now besieg'd in Form, And 'twas too late o'th' Year to take't by Storm; It would be fruitless too, and serve their turns, No more than Dixmude does, or little Furnes: But (in his Judgment) if they'd cast their Pray'r To Winter-Quarters, till the Spring o'th Year, They might have need with all their Strength to pray, And then proclaim a Weekly Fasting-Day. There was no answering to so plain a Case, But (with low Bows) the Motion all embrace. Straight they gave Orders that a Proclamation Should strictly charge this Praying, Fasting Nation, That it no more should trouble Heaven's Quiet With Pray'rs, or Guts croaking for want of Diet. So much Devotion in this Age we find, That were it not by publick Laws confin'd, Our Publick Pray'rs and Fasts would strike us blind. But see how vain all Mortal Councils are, We dream of Peace, but feel th'Effects of War; For scarce were these great Orders fully given, Scarce the black Sheet dy'd with the Stygian Leven, When Charleroy cry'd out, O help, she cry'd! The French are plying hard my leaky Side; Is this a time to give your Praying o'er, When we are weltring in Confed'rate Gore? When whizzing Bullets, and the roaring Bomb, Gall us from Stem to Stern, can you be dumb? What have your Arms, what hath your Mony done? Your Pray'rs are all that we depend upon. She spake; and the amazed Council heard her Tale, They hung their Heads, and look'd with Envy pale: Ah cursed French, they cry'd, cannot one Town Escape your lasting Fury? What Renown Can you obtain, what Honour get you by't? 'Tis well our Mighty Monarch's out of sight: Had he been nigh! But 'tis no time to talk, Post to the Printer, tell him we revoke Our late delib'rate Orders; we will fast While Gallick Bullets fly, and pray as fast. But 'twas too late, for hasty Time had set His Iron Teeth upon the fatal Sheet: But Fame (as Goddesses have done before) Came in the nick, and brought a Story o'er, That our most vigilant King was gone to fight, And vow'd t'should not be lost, out of his sight: This News restor'd us, and with swifter speed Fresh Posts were sent, to tell there was no need To stop the Press. But, O ye Gods! how short Are mortal Joys, how are we made your sport! Like Tennis-Balls you toss us to and fro; Or Shittlecocks, driven from Foe to Foe. Scarce was this Post dispatch'd, when an Alarm Put all the Council in a new Vacarme; For it was said, our Conqu'ror was retir'd, And the unlucky Town again was fir'd. Fast, fast, the Council cry'd, let's pray amain, Fly to the Press, and bid it stop again. So on the top of Horeb Moses stood, Out of whose flinty Side he lash'd a Flood; Aaron and Hur with him beheld the Fight, Between brave Joshua and th'Amalekite: When he held up his Finger, they prevail; But when he let it down, the Jews turn tail. During this time, Posts hurry'd thro the Town, And in their Course fell'd one another down; Flux, and reflux, of differing Councils dash'd, And, in rebounding Air, their Orders clash'd: So rose the Atoms from their Bed of Night, And in Confusion choak'd the new-born Light. What Heart could hold to see the sad Distractions, Which had well-nigh o'er-whelm'd three potent Nations? The French themselves took pity of our Fear, And vow'd they'd spare the Town till the next Year. But now proclaim a Calm; for once more Fame Post on a Gale of blust'ring Weather came; And 'midst this Hurly-burly, loudly sings A Rest to us, and to the best of Kings. In short, the King (with all his Victories) Had safely past the dangerous Northern Seas: What would y' have more? We've got our King at last, And all must grant 'tis now no time to fast. Sing then my Muse a Halleluja Song, Raise up thy Lute, which was to Fasting strung: Thanksgiving is thy Theme, and lofty Ode, And Eucharisticon thy charming Mode. Great in the Field, and subtle in Debate, The King conven'd his Ministers of State; Flanders was not nam'd there, nor the Descent, Whether it was, or was not truly meant: Nor did they speak of the great Siege of Dunkirk, Nor of their Victory obtain'd at Steinkirk. But not to spend our Oil and Time, in dwelling On Negatives, as I was now a telling; We do affirm, in short, that the sole Cause Of this August and Grave Assembly, was How to resolve on this Thanksgiving-Day: For some still thought we had more Cause to pray. These urg'd besides, the Saints might think it rude To make a Feast upon the Fast of Jude. But the Arch-Haman, whose Advice they took In all such Matters, first his Noddle shook; Then cry'd,—Great Sir, Saints neither eat nor drink, Nor do they care, or know what Mortals think; To fast before, or else behind a Saint, Or not at all, we for Convenience grant: But at the worst, when three Fasts come together, We may post pone, or else commute at pleasure. Our Gracious Queen (God bless her) when she spy'd How well this Man of God could thus divide, Distinguish, prove, lay open, and decide; Well spoke, she said, my Vote concurs with yours: Let sick Men fast for four and twenty Hours, Because they cannot eat; what's that to those Whose Health and Strength require a treble Dose? Besides, the King's return'd, let that suffice For you, and Us, to dry Our Royal Eyes; His mighty Self, all o'er with Trophies grac'd, As sometime Men wore Ribbands round the Waste; Or like an Orange stuck with Cloves, so thick Between the Spice, a Pin can hardly stick: 'Tis He's return'd again, and with him brought Blessings in store, for which he stoutly fought. But that's your Care, I have another Cause, And am oblig'd to feast by Nature's Laws: Born for Delight, to eat, drink, sleep and play; I cannot force my self to fast or pray, I wish that every one were a Thanksgiving-Day. All bow'd around, and with submissive Voice Agreed we had great Reason to rejoice: But a Debate arose, where they should fix The main great Cause; for to be too prolix In Proclamations, 'twould anticipate Those Rhymes and Pamphlets which on Conquest wait. Some then propos'd to put the stress o'th' Matter On his Return: But those who could not flatter, Own'd 'twas a Cause; but all they stood upon Was, that 'twas not a Cause sine qua non: For had he ne'er return'd, no Man will say There was no Cause for a Thanksgiving-Day. Kings may be lost, but Kings can never die; For still successive Kings their place supply: But if a Battel's lost, or Town be ta'en, The Devil's in't, how shall we take't again? High Words had like t'arose; but the wise King, Who was best able to decide the thing, Thus spake—My Lords, said he, I would believe (Howe'er you differ now) you all receive My Person as a Blessing to the Nation; 'Twas I brought Riches in with Reformation; 'Twas I restor'd you to your Liberties; 'Twas I secur'd your Lives and Properties; 'Twas I kept out the Foreigners you fear'd, Since that you little French or Irish heard: 'Twas I made Ireland happy, entred France, Where Schonberg, by my Order, did advance The Protestant Religion; vow'd, in Print, That ne'er a Monk or Papist should live in't. 'Twas I turn'd Popery out from hence, and sent The English-Scottish Kirk to Banishment. 'Twas I turn'd S? out, and put one in Who will dispense, as fast as you can sin; Who will not tie you up to the strict Rules Of Oaths, or Orders, Snares for squeamish Fools: Unblest, and unbaptiz'd, this Church's Son Hath all his Mother's Children half undone. My Countrymen I brought, without pretension (To serve you here) of either Pay or Pension. 'Twas I that call'd, and kept your Parliament So pure and free, there's not one Member in't (God is my Witness if I tell you a Lye) That e'er took Bribe, Pension, or Salary. 'Twas I that all your Grievances redrest, And did my self of my own Rights divest. 'Twas I convoy'd, and then increas'd your Trade: None but my self did e'er your Rights invade. 'Twas I—But 'tis too much, I will not boast What I have done for you, to your own Cost. Let it suffice, I'll not put such a stress On my own Merits, as to clog the Press. But since I find some of you seem to grutch, And think the Cause of my Return's too much; What think you of my Victory at Sea? Make that the Cause of your Thanksgiving-day. For my part, I'm indifferent, chuse you whether; Or if you please, we'll twist 'em both together: There will enough be left t'expatiate, For all must grant that this Campaign was great. 'Twas not in hugger-mugger what I've done, Since all th'World knows 'twas in th'open Sun. All with deep Admiration were struck dumb, The King admir'd too what at last would come. At length, after they'ad gaz'd and gap'd awhile, A Lord stood up, and with a Courtier's Smile, Great Sir, said he, 'tis now well understood, Whate'er your Actions are, your Memory's good: We now perceive how great's the Obligation, Which justly's owing to you by the Nation. We're loth to break with you upon that score, And to our broken Merchants add still more. But if you'll trust us still (for all that's past) We may perhaps be even with you at last. In the mean while, We will proclaim a Feast in your own way, And to so joyful a Thanksgiving-day Whole Tuns of Grease and Kitchin-stuff we'll pay. 'Twas said, and it was done, and strait each Lord Made his low Exit from the Council-board. Now good Miss Muse once more bring in your Aid, And shew your self a well-bred civil Maid; For I'm oblig'd to squeeze more Reasons out, How this damn'd Proclamation came about. Imprimis then (for Method must be chose Whether we write in Verse, or write in Prose) We'll take these Matters fairly as they lie, Not all at once, but each successively: First then (if I may say't without offence) 'Twere fit to thank the King for going hence; For had he stay'd, God knows what had been done, Namur it self perhaps had not been won: But more of that hereafter. Next let's tell The sad Disasters which the French befel, At Sea, I mean; for 'tis well known at Land They had both Wind and Weather at command: Their Fleet came struggling 'gainst the Eastern Wind, And full six Weeks they tack'd about, to find Our Navy out, which not a hundred were, And they full four and forty Men of War. With Insolence upon our Line they bore, And whole Broad-sides with wondrous Fury pour: The Fight was sharp, and Fortune doubtful stood To which she'd give the Empire of the Flood; When mighty Mars descended in a Mist, And the fierce equal Combatants dismist: We neither took nor lost a Ship of ours; Nor were we conquered, or Conquerors. But Neptune, who of late a Neuter stood Between the British and the Mogan Blood, Finding both running in our King, cry'd out, Return you Tide, and bring the French about: Since England and my Dutch are join'd, what Foe Shall dare t'attack them, and unpunish'd go? I'll beat the French my self, and for their sake So strong a Tide in Alderney I'll make, Their Cables all shall drag, and Anchors break. 'Twas said, and it was done; and the poor French Fir'd sixteen Ships his dreadful Ire to quench. Thanks to the King then for this Victory won; For if this will not pass, I'Gad I've done. Item, the Siege of Namur next comes on, At last 'twas weak, at first damnably strong: So Mons at first was held impregnable; But when 'twas ta'en, Faith 'twas scarce tenable. But howsoe'er it was, the King was there, And ne'er express'd a single Mark of Fear: He heard the Cannons roar, saw the Bombs fly; And that's a Demonstration he was nigh. 'Tis true the Town was lost; who can help that? The French stood in his way; so 'twa'nt his fault. The King of France our Monarch came to meet, And in the Trenches kiss his conqu'ring Feet; But our good King thought fitter to forbear, And, out of Modesty, would not come there: But Thanks are due, that he was pleas'd to own, And then depose to th'taking of the Town. For our Gazettes such strange Relations bring, A hundred thousand Men might doubt the thing Without the Attestation of a King. Item— Two hundred thousand Pounds to Savoy sent, I will be sworn that Mony was well spent: For with this Aid, That Duke (like that great Man, The King of France) with forty thousand Men Went down the Hill, and so came up agen. 'Tis true Duke S?berg then declar'd in Print, That to recover our Rights he there was sent; And promis'd if he took all Dauphiny, He firmly would establish Popery: Thanks t'him for that, or we had never known Who fought for Int'rest, who Religion. Next, Our Descent at Sea appears, which ran (So much 'twas nois'd) from hence to Ispahan: Four hundred thousand Pounds (so great a Sum, Into a measur'd Verse 'twill hardly come) Yet this, and more, and much in Debt was spent To furnish out this well-contriv'd Descent. Louis, they say, was almost dead with Fear; And 'cause he thought Versails might be too near, He soon retir'd still further from the Foe, And went to hunt and dance at Fontainbleau: Some say he did not fear; but if 'twere true, I'm sure our Thanks at least for that are due. Next bloody Steinkirk comes full in our way, Pox on't, we fought upon the Sabbath-day; And that's been ever held a Profanation By our True Protestant Reformed Nation: That's the true Reason why we bore the brunt, We see the Godly Dutch would ne'er have don't; They stood their ground and pray'd whilst we Fools fought; But we, forsooth, were better fed than taught: The French retir'd, and ran away to Mass, Our Lion's Paw was headed by an Ass. Well, we were flogg'd and pepper'd too, 'tis true; But yet to give the Devil and Dutch their due, Had not they brought us off, we might have lain Till we'd been wash'd away with Winter's Rain. This then deserves a long Thanksgiving-day; For tho we lost our Men, we sav'd their Pay. And now our hand is in, let's not forget To thank Count S?mes, That we were soundly beat: Go on, brave Men, cry'd he, Conquer or Die, The Truth shall not be wrong'd whilst I stand by; And stand he did, as firm as any Post, Till he saw all his hated English lost. Ah, Country-men, had I but time to prove How well the Dutch our poor three Kingdoms love, There's not a Man but would forsake his Farms, And our dear Dutch embrace with open Arms. Now little Furnes, thou shalt be called great, And future Ages shall thy Fame repeat; We little thought that our high-flown Descent (And now the Riddle's out) for thee was meant: Some Politicians laid 'twould land at Bolen; Others as wisely judg'd 'twould sail to Colen: Some were for Brest, St. Malo, or the Havre, And laid great odds the French would never save her: Some for La Hogue; but others with less Malice, Only pretended to recover Calais: Some were for Bilboa, but none thought of Thee; This was Design, this was Sheer Policy: The rest was given out for a pretence, First to surprize, and then to nab the French. And who in War or Poetry would rise, Take it from me, must do it by surprize. Thrice little Furnes, and great Dixmude thy Brother, For whom ten thousand Men made such a pother; You are the Twins which our Descent brought forth, The World must grant it was a mighty Birth: Dunkirk and Ghent were Gossips, and some think The first may dearly pay the Groaning-Drink. Then Thanks, Great Monarch, for whate'er they cost, These Forts declare our Mony was not lost. Lastly, and chiefly, (for 'tis fit at last The biggest Plumb should keep our Mouth in Taste) What Thanks are due for the King's Preservation From the Granvallian Assassination? It was a strange Escape as e'er was heard; And yet 'twas strange the King too should be scar'd With one Gun, who so many Guns had heard. Nor would we fail to thank that happy Spirit, Whose Vigilance did such Encomiums merit; But that he look'd so stern, one scarce could tell Whether he came from Heaven or from Hell. If from the last, we ought to thank the Devil, That to our Monarch was so wondrous civil. Thank Grandvall's Powder, which mistook its Aim, And made it self invisible, not him. Thank Parker that he left St. Germain's Court Three days before the cautious Witness swore't: Thanks to the King too, that he took such care T'escape these private Dangers of the War. Poor Gentleman, he was much pity'd here; And these Escapes have cost us many a Tear, Heaven send him better luck for the next Year. But hold my Muse, for should our Thanks run on, They would amaze the all-beholding Sun, And strike a blush upon the pale-fac'd Moon: Then modestly take up, and loudly tell How we set forth our Joys by Candle and Bell. Scarce did the Polish Northern Star appear, Which some great Authors call the lesser Bear: Scarce had the Cock crow'n once or twice at most, And Phœbus within ken o'th'Eastern Coast: Or in plain English, scarce had the Clock struck four, 'Tis no great matter whether less or more; When a litigious jangling ill-bred Sound, Through all our Hills and Valleys did rebound; 'Twas thought the Devil's Arse o'th'Peak had got Some rumbling Wind or Cholick in his Gut; And by successive Raptures did foretel Downfal of Church, as by the Sound of Bell. Some thought the Body-Politick in a Fit, And the Soul-Bell knelling its last Exit. 'Twas not ill guest, for Church and State may find There are strange Sounds in your Rebellious Wind; And 't might be prov'd by easy Metaphor, Wind may be said to ring, and Bells to roar. Others scarce well awake, judg'd it the Groan Of drowsy Sackbut, or the Bag-pipes Drone: Some swore (who lately had ta'en a larger Sup) The Glasses clink'd round the Indented Cup. In short, they were the City-Choristers, Which thus untimely lugg'd us by the Ears; The Bells I mean that early thus were singing Their Lauds and Mattins, which some Men call ringing. Thus pass'd the chirping Morn. Now when the Sun Was driving up to our Meridian, Some went to Church to hear the New Pray'rs read; Others, who lik'd the Old, lay close in Bed. Some shut their Shops, which was a silent Token, That if those Days came oft, they'd all be broken. The Cannons from the Tower broke through the Wind, And roar'd their Thanks, that they were left behind. Lambeth return'd the Compliment, and fir'd Volleys of Blessings as they'd been inspir'd. High Pr? of Mars, sprung from Samaria's Race, Thou still dost love t'adore in the High Place; Thou thunder'st out thy Gospel in our Ears, And those loud Organs tun'd thy new-made Pray'rs: Thou worst and first of Canterbury's Race, That with a Wife divided Lambeth's Grace. Mars and Bellona ne'er before had met, Roaring and singing on the High-Priest's Seat. Thou Man of Faith, could we believe like you, Who would not turn a Circumcised Jew? Lastly, for now my Muse is almost weary, And too much Labour makes a Mare miscarry: I should say something of the blessed Night, How 'twas set forth with Artificial Light; 'Twas motly at the best, not of a piece, Some black, some white, chequer'd like Fox and Geese. The Lights were not of Virgin-Wax, 'tis true, For Hybla's Bee works not for such a Crew; Nor of your precious Aromatick Gums, Nor your sweet Oil which from Oneglia comes. In short, they were of greasy Kitchin-stuff, Most proper for th'Occasion; that's enough. May those who love them see no better Light; For my part I have done, and so good Night. On the Death of the Late Queen. Poema est Pictura Loquens. [1] Long our divided State Hung in the Ballance of a doubtful Fate, When one bright Nymph the gath'ring Clouds dispel'd, And all the Griefs of Albion heal'd; Her the united Land obey'd, No more to Jealousy inclin'd, Nor fearing Power with so much Vertue join'd. She knew her Task, and nicely understood To what Intention Kings are made, Not for their own, but for their Peoples good; 'Twas that prevailing Argument alone Determin'd Her to fill the vacant Throne: And yet with sadness She beheld A Crown devolving on her Head, By the Excesses of a Prince misled; When by her Royal Birth compel'd, To what her God, and what her Country claim'd, Tho by a servile Faction blam'd, How graceful were the Tears she shed? 2. When waiting only for a Wind, Against our Isle the Power of France was arm'd; Her ruling Arts in their true Lustre shin'd: The Winds themselves were by her Influence charm'd; 'Twas her Authority and Care supply'd The Safety, which our want of Troops deny'd. Secure and undisturb'd the Scene Of Albion seem'd, and like her Eyes serene; Vain was the Invader's Force, Revenge and Pride; Maria reign'd, and Heav'n was on our Side: The Scepter by Her self unsought, Gave double Proofs of her Heroick Mind, With Skill she sway'd it, and with Ease resign'd. So the Dictator from Retirement brought, Repel'd the Danger that did Rome alarm, And then return'd contented to his Farm. 3. Fatal to the Fair and Young, Accurs'd Disease! how long Have wretched Mothers mourn'd thy Rage, Robb'd of the Hope and Comfort of their Age! From the unhappy Lovers side, How often hast thou torn the blooming Bride! Now like a Tyrant, rising by degrees To worse Extremes, and blacker Villanies; Practis'd in Ruin for some Ages past, Thou hast brought forth a general one at last. Common Disasters Sorrow raise; But Heav'n severer Frowns amaze. The Queen, a Word, a Sound, Of Nations once the Hope and firm Support, Wealth of the Needy, Guard of the Opprest, The Joy of all, the Wisest and the Best: A Name which Echo did rebound With loud Applause from neighb'ring Shores; Their Admiration, the Delight of ours, Becomes unutterable now. The Crouds in that dejected Court, Where languishing Maria lay, Want pow'r to ask the News they come to know: Silent their drooping Heads they bow, Silence it self proclaims th'approaching Woe; Even Maria's latest Care, Whom Winter's Seasons nor contending Jove, Nor watchful Fleets could from his glorious Purpose move, Intrepid in the Storms of War, and in the midst of flying Deaths sedate, Now trembles, now he sinks beneath the mighty Weight. The Hero to the Man gives way, Unhappy Isle for half an Age a Prey, To fierce Dissension, or despotick Sway; Redeem'd from Anarchy to be undone By the mistaken Measures of the Throne. Thy Monarch's meditating dark Designs, Or boldly throwing off the Mask, Fond of the Power, unequal to the Task: Thy self without remaining Signs Of antient Vertue, so deprav'd As ev'n to wish to be enslav'd; What more than Human Aid could raise Thee from a State so low, Protect Thee from thy self, thy greatest Foe? Something Celestial sure, a Heroine Of matchless Form and a Majestick Mien; Awful, respected, fear'd, but more belov'd; More than her Laws, her great Example mov'd. The Bounds, that in her Godlike Mind Were to her Passions set, severely shin'd; But that of doing Good was unconfin'd: So just, that Absolute Command, Destructive in another Hand, In Hers had chang'd its Nature, had been useful made. Oh had she longer staid, Less swiftly to her Native Heav'n retir'd; For her the Harps of Albion had been strung, The tuneful Nine could never have aspir'd To a more lofty and immortal Song. On the Death of the Queen. In English. The attribution of this poem is questionable. The Queen deceas'd so pleas'd, the King so griev'd, As if the Hero dy'd, the Woman liv'd: Alas! we err'd i'th' choice of our Commanders, He should have knotted, and She gone to Flanders. The Weasel uncas'd, or the In and Outside of a Priest drawn to the Life. A Protestant Priest, a Man of great Fame, To be Rich and Great was his only Aim, It was Dr. Weasel, the very same, Which no body can deny. This Weasel at first to get him some Grub, A little small Girl, and a little good Bub, Diogenes like he preach'd in a Tub, Which, &amp;c. Yet in those Days he was very fickle, And tho he was Head of a great Conventicle, Yet he had a month's mind to be higher a little, Which &amp;c. And finding Ambition to grow with his Pride, And if he'd be Great he must change his Side, He left all his Flock, and his first Faith deny'd, Which, &amp;c. By which they perceiv'd his Heart was grown Evil, They put forth a Book, which he thought uncivil, The Title was, Weasel's Dispute with the Devil, Which, &amp;c. In which Learned Piece they there discover, That, like unto Judas, he was a false Brother, And of a full Bag he is a great Lover, Which, &amp;c. To which bloody Charge he answer'd in Season, And why he left them, told 'em his Reason, And prov'd all their Tenets did border on Treason, Which, &amp;c. And then, like a Hero, he did lay about, And swore he would preach all their Tub-bottoms out, And prove them to be a Phanatical Rout, Which, &amp;c. And truly he was as good as his Word, And writ a fine Book, tho by them abhor'd, The Case of Resistance, which stands on Record, Which, &amp;c. In that Loyal Piece, against the Precise, He proved by all the Grave, Learned, and Wise, Obedience is better than all Sacrifice, Which, &amp;c. And then he proceeded by Scripture and Reason, To prove Non-resistance always in Season, And its opposite Doctrine no less than Treason, Which, &amp;c. And having observ'd the Laws o'th' Nation, With those of the Gospel had a Relation, Said, those that Resist would receive just Damnation, Which, &amp;c. To strengthen this Point he quoted St. Paul, St. Peter, St. Jude, our Saviour and all, Proving none cou'd be sav'd who from that Faith did fall, Which, &amp;c. But what will you say of this Weasel stout, If after all this he shou'd face about, And in print tell the World in truth he was out? Which, &amp;c. Yet Reason and Conscience a War did begin, And struggled with Pride and Ambition within, To take the new Oaths he long thought a Sin, Which, &amp;c. His Spouse, like Job's Wife, to ease his Heart-aching, Did press him to swear that he was mistaken, Tho some think it was for to save his Bacon, Which, &amp;c. At first he did doubt, and therefore did pray, That Heaven wou'd instruct him in the right Way, Whether Jemmy or William he ought to obey, Which, &amp;c. The Pass at the Boyne determin'd that Case, And Precept to Providence then did give place, To change his Opinion he thought no disgrace, Which, &amp;c. For tho he had done the same Thing before, Yet now for his Comfort he need change no more, For his Case of Allegiance will serve for a score, Which, &amp;c. For there he has plainly made it appear, That Strength gives a Right, therefore we may swear To him in Possession, tho not the Right Heir, Which, &amp;c. And shou'd a Fray happen 'twixt Father and Son, If the Boy beat his Father, and so make him run, Providence had appointed that Thing to be done, Which, &amp;c. Besides, he has prov'd the mighty Convenience Of Subjects transferring their Faith and Allegiance, To those that can crush 'em all into Obedience, Which, &amp;c. So let O. P. or P. O. be King, Or any one else, it is the same Thing, For only Heaven does that Blessing bring, Which, &amp;c. But this with the Scripture can never agree, As Hosea the Eighth and the Fourth you may see, They have set up Kings, but yet not by me. Which, &amp;c. Now what need the Prophet there to complain, If the People's Anointed, and God's were the same? If so, David's Friends they all were to blame, Which, &amp;c. For tho God permitted the People to bring Good David's Son forth, and proclaim him King, Yet all the World knows how he punish'd the Thing, Which, &amp;c. And may all such Sons enjoy the same Fate, That dethrone their Father, and him Abdicate; No doubt it will happen in time, soon or late, Which, &amp;c. With one Remark more I'll end this dull Song, And his fulsom Republican Arguments strong, Which makes Wrong to be Right, and Right to be Wrong, Which, &amp;c. That Famous old Priest, the Vicar of Bray, Who in all Change of Times knew how to obey, Was an Ass to the Weasel, if I may so say, Which, &amp;c. And truly I think no more need be said, By a Penny we know how a Shilling is made, For Priest and Priest-craft is all but a Trade, Which, &amp;c. And thus I in little have drawn to the Life, His Flesh and his Spirit always at strife, But the Flesh did prevail by the help of his Wife, Which no body can deny, deny; which no body can deny; England's late Jury. A Satire. The attribution of this poem is questionable. Wisely an Observator said, (Who knew our State full well) England need never be afraid, Or seek out any foreign Aid, Our Dangers to repel. But then he never did suppose Our Army near so small; Or Statesmen to oblige their Foes, Should with Seven Thousand wipe our Nose: A Force like none at all. This Vote made Lewis give a Smile, And laugh within his Sleeve; Scarce did he credit it a while, Britain shou'd for his Glory toil, Which now he does believe. But when again such Men were chose, As did our Force disband; He found our Ruin follow'd close, And had no Reason to oppose Such as went Hand in Hand. S?r forgets he was a Slave, When in his younger Years He was the Sp?r and a K?; And not so much inclin'd to save, Or think upon our Fears. But then there lay a Patent by To gratify his Pride; On which he often cast an Eye, And on the Stop did wonder why Totness was not supply'd. Resenting an Affront like this, He forthwith veers about; Mad that he did Preferment miss, (A Feather fit for Pride like his) And courts the fickle Rout. But his Designs are understood, The Matter's very plain: Pretending for his Country's good, He since has acted all he cou'd To keep his Prince in Pain. For a long time he cou'd not Swear, With a nice Conscience bred; Nor take an Oath against an Heir, That to a Monarch did repair, At least till he was dead. But when All-conquering Gold was brought, Which glitter'd in his Eyes; Quickly a Miracle was wrought, (Exeter knows it was no Fault) They that have Wealth are Wise. M?s?ve has Parts, and Eloquence, And others say, speaks well; Tho young Kit met a Recompence, To bring his Father to his Sense, Spite did the Guilt repel. Nothing can biass stout Sir Kit, Civility is Vain, For he must exercise his Wit, And sometimes did at random hit, Which Credit did obtain. H?rt pretends unto the Law, And makes a fearful din; As little Sense as e'er I saw, His Judgment brittle as a Straw, And oftner out than in. F?ch, he has Sense and Rhetorick, And seems of S?m?rs Kidney; His Lungs do to the Quarrel stick, And once was very Politick, And some think hard on Sidney. H?m?nd, he runs among the Herd, Is Violent and Strong; Wou'd fain seem Grave without a Beard: But he needs never to be fear'd, His Judgment is too young. J? H? sets up for one of Sense, Does for a Patriot stand: Most wonder at his Impudence! That he thereto should lay pretence, Who was the Court's Disband. He who was reckon'd the Buffoon In former Parliaments, Fickle and Changing like the Moon; Till French Gold came he was undone, Now vents his Discontents. But most Men wonder that Sir Batt So eager is to rail: Yet why should we admire at that? Since his Profession is to chat, But seldom does prevail. Some (he had heard) by Speeches rise, And to Preferment leap: But such had Merit, and were Wise, And did not Foreigners despise, Nor after Faction creep. Never for Rebels did harangue, Nor tenter-hook the Law; But left the Criminal to hang, Till one Foot did the other bang, To keep Mankind in awe. The fam'd Civilian, who can write Of Parliamental Power; If he has Judgment, he has Spite, And goes beyond the Matter quite, A sort of second SHOWER. Upon Records he spends his Ink, He writes at such a rate: To prove what few did ever think, Unless depriv'd of Sense in Drink, Yet of a plodding Pate. Gr?nv?le, he strolls unto the Fairs, To get himself Renown; Yet for this Faction he declares, And to their Club at Night repairs, To regulate the Crown. The times are likely sure to mend, When Pr?r rules the State; Pr?r the noble Dorset's Friend, (For whom the Learned World contend) Justly deserves his Hate. Bl?t, with proud imperious Face, And Forehead made of Brass; Forgets the Honour of his Place, Does all true Policy disgrace, And for a Fool may pass. P?s shall marshal up the Rear, With Rhetorick Debate; And tho good-natur'd he appear, Yet all his Services will steer To undermine the State. These are the Jury which were struck, To try Britannia's Claim: And how could we expect good Luck From such as did with Lewis truck, To their Eternal Shame? Conclusion. Others below the Dignity of Rhyme, Shall 'scape my Satire till another time: Twelve Men like these, a Nation might undo, And let 'em, if again we trust 'em, too. No, no, fair Britain at her Wrongs awakes; Finds what ye mean, and other Methods takes. Your Popularity at last expires, And Men of better Tempers she requires: Despis'd at home, mutter your Discontent, And know the Nation spoke her Mind by KENT. SATIRE. Declining Venus has no Force o'er Love, The tender Ganymede now rules above; By Influence we die for amorous Boys, Changing to Godlike Pleasures from vain Toys: Besides, 'tis Interest and by that we steer, To love with Princes is to gain their Ear. He's an ill Courtier who can have a Passion For nauseous Petticoat when out of fashion, B?s are still the Stamp of Revolution. Submissive Woman artfully invites Each gazing Fop, and every Look requites; Yielding to Nature, is no more confin'd, Foe to Despair, in all her Actions kind. Else Yel?ton should never lead the Van, Stunted throughout, the Miniature of Man: The Widow Le?son that vain Brat vould charm, Dil?ds Arrival dreaded for more harm; But Faustus Farmer by his Magick Art Levels two Bellies to come at one part. R?ss is so good, 'tis pity here to name her, She drinks as well as does, no Soul can blame her: S?wich is willing, but slow Lovers spoil Her good Intentions, such are How and Boyle; Poor Br?don's Fate she loves a batter'd Bully, An ill Performer, yet by Descent no Cully. W?ham, incestuous Jew, now Beauty's gone, Prevails o'er Politicks with grunting John. Ri?ond could make no Steps, she was so sore, Where Earls, Knights, Priests and Pox has been before: So qualify'd, to Grandeur she had claim, Those Princes never wed to meaner Fame. R?liffe on Mount resembles Whetstone's Park, Painted and patch'd with Ba?r for her Spark: So have I seen a Cit at Door with Trull, By Noon as drunk, and of themselves as full. Ch?l has lost her long prevailing Art, And now for Drudgery keeps Booby Hart: So P?brook sends her unknown Gems to pawn, To mollify that costive Clown De???un. Thus Beauty fading, falls from step to step, At first is paid, then takes its turn to keep, For Countess Dowagers, and Maids at Court, The never-failing Lovers of the Sport: They feel the Malice of despairing Fits, When ill Success turns Lovers into Wits. This stingless Satire's Author if you'd know, The Dial speaks not, but it points Jack H?. A new Ballad, call'd, The Brawny Bishop's Complaint. The attribution of this poem is questionable. To the Tune of Packington's Pound. 1 When B?t perceiv'd the beautiful Dames, Who flock'd to the Chappel of hilly St. James, On their Lovers the kindest Looks did bestow, And smil'd not on him while he bellow'd below; To the Princess he went With pious intent, This dangerous Ill in the Church to prevent: O Madam! quoth he, our Religion is lost, If the Ladies thus ogle the Knights of the Toast. 2 Your Highness observes how I labour and sweat, Their Affections to raise, and new Flames to beget; And sure when I preach, all the World will agree, That their Ears and their Eyes should be pointed on me: But now I can't find One Beauty so kind, As my Parts to regard, or my Presence to mind; Nay, I scarce have a sight of any one Face, But those of old Oxford, and ugly Arglass. 3 These sorrowful Matrons, with Hearts full of Truth, Repent for the manifold Sins of their Youth: The rest with their Tattle my Harmony spoil; And Bur???ton, An?sey, K?gston and B?le Their Minds entertain With Thoughts so profane, 'Tis a Mercy to find that at Church they contain: Ev'n Hen?ham's Shapes their weak Fancies intice, And rather than me they will ogle the Mr. B???ty Vice-Chamberlain. Vice. 4 These Practices, Madam, my Preaching disgrace; Shall Laymen enjoy the just Rights of my Place? Then all may lament my Condition for hard, To thresh in the Pulpit without a Reward. Then pray condescend Such Disorders to end, And from the ripe Vineyards such Labourers send; Or build up the Seats that the Beauties may see The Face of no brawny Pretender but me. 5 The Princess by rude Importunities press'd, Tho she laugh'd at his Reasons, allow'd his Request: And now Britain's Nymphs in a Protestant Reign Are lock'd up at Prayers like the Virgins in Spain; And all are undone As sure as a Gun. Whenever a Woman is kept like a Nun, If any kind Man from Bondage will save her, The Lass in Gratitude grants him the Favour. On the Death of the Queen and Marshal Luxemburgh. Behold, Dutch Prince, here lie th'unconquer'd Pair, Who knew your Strength in Love, your Strength in War! Unequal Match to both no Conquest gains, No Trophy of your Love or War remains. On the Report of King James's sending a Plenipotentiary to the Treaty of Ryswick. King James, say the Jacks, as other Kings do, To the Treaty must send an Ambassador too. But where can we find a Person so wise, As is fit to take on him an Office so nice; To act from a Prince whom no body owns, But those whose Advice before lost him his Thrones; To beg that the Princes would grant him a share In a Treaty of Peace, who had none in the War? And since for Religion he quitted his Throne, And foster'd a Bastard instead of a Son, To pray they'd consider his Losses at home, And send him with Passports to Warsaw or Rome, For a Crown, or a Cap, or some such like thing, That since he can't live, he may look like a King: For the Kingdoms he lost t'allow him another, And make him a Monarch of some thing or other: For truly (an't please you) the Envoy must say, Our Protestant Friends are hang'd out of the way, Our Servants forsake us, our Allies deny us; And if the good Catholicks will not stand by us, Our Queen will run mad, our self will want Bread, Our Heir too, in spite of the Bargain we made, Must home to his Father and work at his Trade. To the Earl of Portland, on his Embassy to France. What! Shall each Patron's ripening Smile infuse A kindly Warmth to each officious Muse? Shall all be prostitute to Dorset's Name, Glutted with Praise, and surfeited with Fame? Shall Spencer peep abroad? and Ormond shine? Shall Sommers sparkle too, and flame in ev'ry Line? And not one Muse for sacred Portland's Fame, To grace his Triumphs, and record his Name? O cou'd I breathe so soft, so sweet a Tune! As Phœbus' self might hear, as Phœbus' self might own; I'd summon all my Fury, all my Lays, I'd riot on thy Charms, and wanton on thy Praise. But see! the Bards stand awfully around, And none e'er yet profan'd the sacred Ground: With conscious Fear they curb their glowing Fire; Yet what they dare not praise, they must admire. Tho most to William, much to you we owe, In him's our Safety, and our Joy in you: For ever happy shall we, must we be, Whilst Albion has her King, and Albion's King has thee. But which of all thy long, thy numerous Train, Which Virtue glitters most, and crowns the noble Scene? A thousand thronging Graces justle there, A thousand Virtues croud and struggle to appear? Which then of all thy Virtues can I chuse, To kindly please a wanton sporting-Muse? Abash'd, like me, the Phrygian Paris lies, And knows not where to fix his golden Prize. When Juno tempts with an alluring Bait, Throws all her gaudy Treasure at his Feet; When Pallas scorning little sordid Gain, Would fill and croud his teeming full-fraught Brain; When Venus crown'd with ev'ry charming Grace, Comes dazling in his Eyes, and lightning in his Face; He knows not which is greatest, which is most, Unfixt, unsettled, variously he's tost, In Raptures drown'd, in Admiration lost. But still of all, of all that come in view, 'Tis chiefly yours to be sincere and true. Fain would I speak of thy well-guarded Trust, And where I can't be lavish, wou'd be just. How much he'as suffer'd, and how much deserv'd, A Faith so often try'd, so well preserv'd: True to your Trust, and faithful to your Care, In ev'ry Place you shine, but dazzle here. In France with equal Lustre you appear, They all adore your Wisdom and your Care: Extoll'd by ev'ry Tongue, they all commend The Prince's Darling, and the Nation's Friend. William himself thou dost out-do in this, For he's the Nation's Friend, but thou art his. Yet Holland, claim not thou an equal Share, Tho with thee Portland suck'd his Infant Air; To Albion then thy weaker part resign, Nor fondly boast that Portland's Virtue's thine: What tho from thee there sprang his antient Line? True British Graces in the Hero shine, True British Virtues crown and stamp him all Divine. As Holland too, may William hither bring; But Holland's Prince is lost in Albion's King. Upon the burning of White-hall, Jan. 4. 1697/8. In English. While leud White-hall burning in justest Flames, Heav'n's Wrath 'gainst Force, and Lust, and Fraud proclaims; In Eagles Shape, the Genius of our Isle, Clapping its Wings, with Joy flew round the Pile: No Chappel, Room of State or Ease exempt. But when the Banquet-house the Flames attempt, Hold! (cry'd the Angel) for this sacred Place, Where Ty?t's Blood wash'd out my Isle's Disgrace, Shall every Fire (but the World's last) outface. Another Version of the same. White-hall, a Palace impious and accurs'd, Where bloody Violence, Treachery and Lust Had revel'd Ages, now her Date expires, She glows and blazes with revenging Fires. While Albion's Genius on a flaming Cloud, Smiling and joyful round the Bonfire rode: He saw each Building sink its lofty Head, And cleanse its black Guilt with atoning red. But when the sacred Pile began to smoke, That sent the Tyr?t to the fatal Stroke; Stop here, ye Flames, he cry'd, These Walls must stand Th' Avengers of our Blood, and Guardians of our Land. A new Answer to an Argument against a Standing-Army. Would they who have nine years look'd sour Against a French and Popish Power, Make Friends with both in half an hour? This is the time. Would they directly break the Sword By which their Freedom was restor'd, And put their Trust in Lewis' Word? This is the time. Would they leave England unprotected, To shew how well they are affected, And get themselves next bout elected? This is the time. Would they preserve their Wives and Pullets Against the Soldiers Lusts and Gullets, And break our Guns to save our Bullets? This is the time. Would they oblige a Winter-Sea Their prudent Orders to obey, And keep a standing Wind in pay? This is the time. Would they but say what they're pursuing, Whom they're advancing, whom undoing, What pack of Knaves shall prove our Ruin? This is the time. A-God's Name let 'em shew their Games, And fix to one of these Extremes, A Commonwealth, or else King James; For now's the time. On the Death of Mr. Dryden. The attribution of this poem is questionable. John Dryden Enemies had three; Sir Dick, old Nick, and Jeremy. The Doughty Knight was forc'd to yield; The other two have kept the Field: But had his Life been somewhat holier, He'ad foil'd the Devil and the Collier. On the Death of the Duke of Glocester. Thus translated by the Ld Jefferies. By Dr. Bentley. What reason have I to complain, Since in all times it has been plain, That great and weighty things must soon, Like Jacks with their own Weight, go down? And Nature when upon her Back She lays too much, will surely crack. So little Willy dies, and cares Neither for Scepters, nor our Pray'rs: And I shall love him long, for all The Hopes he gave us were but small. Or rather God, who gave us Birth, Being in Wrath with lazy Earth, Takes this occasion, and prefers Illustrious Souls among the Stars. If it be so, I told a Lye, And little Willy does not die; But mounts alive, and swiftly flies, On airy Horseback thro the Skies. 'Tis the same Horse old Enoch rode, And Asgil keeps to go to God. Now see the Youth without his Clothes, How like a new-born Flow'r he shows. See how his rosy Cheeks do shine Among his Ancestors Divine. While we poor Mortals here below Our Sighs and Tears in vain bestow; And empty Obsequies are paid, Just as if he were really dead: Which makes it plain, that living on A hated Life, now he is gone, Will be to us, altho our Breath Should ne'er be stopt, a double Death. Dialogue between the Ghost of Capt. Kidd, and a Kid-napper. Kid. From the Boat of old Charon in the Stygian Ferry, From my Ship I am come again to my Wherry, And from thence, my old Friend, with you to be merry: Which no body can deny. Nap. Stand off, thou grand Pirate, I have nothing to do With such plund'ring Rogues and Robbers as you, Had I been of your Jury, I had hang'd you too: Which, &amp;c. Kid. How now Brother Napper, why in such a Fury? It could not have been worse, had you been of my Jury: But I left you in better Temper I assure you: Which, &amp;c. Nap. But you and the Devil still ow'd me a Shame, And now with a Vengeance at last it came, And has quite ruin'd my honest good Name: Which, &amp;c. Kid. But Brother, you know that was pretty well gone; For tho the Seeds of your Honesty often were sown, I never yet heard that any were grown: Which, &amp;c. Nap. Thou Son of a Boatswain begot in a Skuller, Thou Dunce of a Pirate, my Head is not duller; Tho you got your Wealth faster, my Pocket is fuller: Which, &amp;c. Kid. Be not so haughty and angry, good Brother, If we two Kidnappers understand one another, There will be no occasion for all this pother: Which, &amp;c. Nap. A Kinsman, but no Cater Cousin I had; And of such you know I oft ship'd you a Lad, But this last and the Law have almost made me mad: Which, &amp;c. Kid. I hope you took warning by my woful Condition, For that good Advice I gave with Contrition, To take care how you acted beyond your Commission: Which, &amp;c. Nap. A Commission they told me I had of the Peace, But not to send People away to the Seas, Which makes me almost to melt in my Grease: Which, &amp;c. Kid. It is time I confess, now you're taken thus napping, To take care lest you coach it with me to Wapping, Since you see me trapan'd, some are as good at trapping: Which, &amp;c. Nap. 'Tis true, Brother Kid, that I live in the Strand, Where Low-water Mark is the nearer at hand, You are Pirate at Sea, as I Pirate at Land: Which nobody can deny. A Congratulatory Poem to the Right Honourable Sir E. S. &amp;c. Tho Poets praise those most who need it least, These by your Foes must all be Truths confest; That Nature form'd you vigorous and strong, And Strength of Nature makes you hold out long: Who by her sage Dispensing Power obtain'd More Wit and Sense, than your young Rival gain'd From all the painful Labours of the Schools, And made you early talk to Men, not Fools. With Judgment still, not Heat, your Course you run, To finish well that Race so well begun; With equal Pace, and no ill-govern'd Heat, And with no Pompous Patent, Vainly Great; With Wealth and Honour, still despis'd, you're crown'd, Yet want that still, with which you most abound: Not that a Man knows more their proper use, Or less those mighty Blessings does abuse. You in your Merits most unkindly share Much of that Fate your faithful Friends do here; To whom the same regard, Great SIR, is shown, You oft have met with when the Work was done. In vain, in solid Sense and nervous Prose, We pour'd our Forces on your Rhyming Foes; Those made of late few Ministers of State, Verse was more powerful, or importunate: Verse made th'once humble Mouse a Rat, in haste, And Verse made him, who made the House at last; From Channel-Row he ne'er had cross'd the Main, Nor from flat Rhenish else reach'd brisk Champaign: Verse made his Pastoral Patron rise apace With equal Merit, and with equal Grace; With a more glorious Rod t'adorn his Hand, Than the Caducean Mercury's Golden Wand. Black Rods and White oft work most wondrous Things, When given by Ruling Gods, or Regent Kings. Verse the Fam'd Fleckno rais'd, the Muses Sport, From drudging for the Stage, to drudg at Court; And most deserv'dly crown'd him Laureat now, Who Sternhold has outdone, and Hopkins too. Verse like some Spell rais'd old King Arthur's Train, Made his Round-Table Knights t'appear again, And dub the Man, who more than Callibourn had slain. By Verse mad Clito strove t'advance the Cause, To rhyme away Religion, Kings, and Laws: 'Mongst these the bold Corinthian too might pass, A Minor Poet of th'Inferior Class, Who, not like Horace, rais'd his Monument of Brass. This vast Success of Verse our Poets had, Statesmen at Home, and Envoys all Abroad; To which no Prose had parallel Success, And makes us now accost you thus in Verse. The best of Princes, who first made you Great, Whom you best serv'd, and with him too the State, Dismiss'd you coldly to a kind Retreat— The following Reign confess'd your grave Advice Was wanting, in so tender Case and nice, Where Loyalty the Standard did display, But wild Destruction charg'd in full Array. Th' unwary Greeks their Errors thus confess, And still consult Ulysses in Distress; Thus oft their exil'd Patriots they recal, And Aristides, when distress'd, their All: Thus too their Grecian Prince to Ammon straight Repair'd, for to resolve his doubtful Fate. Nor could our Monarch thus perplext, advise In Place more proper, or a Man more wise. Near to that dangerous Sedgmore down he came, For to consult an Oracle of Fame; Where, had your sage Advice been wisely took, No King had Subjects, Subjects King foorsook. When to th'Extremes of Conscience, and of State, The labouring Kingdom was reduc'd by Fate; You took the wisest, or the happiest Way, And with your Western Legions join'd Torbay: For which the Knighted Bard extends your Fame, And makes th'Old Britons to record your Name. True to your Country still, true to the State, [For who can question Truths we prov'd so late?] All your Designs still honourably Good, Th' Apostate Statesman, not the King withstood. Thus spake your Self;—thus to the Conqueror spake, And pleaded Freedom for Deliverance sake; Freedom for England, Freedom for her Crown, [That's most enslav'd, when most precarious grown] This Service great! with the frank Speech was weigh'd, And both with equal Courtesy repaid. Your much lov'd ISCA truly made your own, And you made Master of your Mistress Town; Where freed from Cares of State, secur'd to sleep, The Town's Palladium you might safely keep, Till Warlike Caledon assum'd the Charge, And set the confin'd Governour more at large. Your great Effort of Courage next was shown, [For bold was he who then dar'd serve the Crown] The Royal Martyr owes his Thanks to you, Th' Oblivion Act, the Regicide Ludlow too His old Commission else had been renew'd, And the Royal Signet seal'd to Royal Blood. Nor did your English Spirit brighter shine, In the Defence of England's Royal Line, Than to your Country's Aid and Interest true, [So much the Patriot rul'd the Courtier too] It timely came to aid th'unequal Fight, And help the injur'd Commons to their Right. To such great Actions something more is due, And somewhat more may be reserv'd for You In a more glorious Reign, than hath been seen Since bright ELIZA's Days, our English Queen: Whilst ANNA, like ELIZA, Worth regards, Only the Valiant, Wise and Good rewards; With the like awful Grace adorns the Throne, And makes her Subjects Happiness her own; With the same Awe, with the like Love obey'd, And a wise Senate to advise and aid: Whilst England's Church and State triumphant stand, And France and Spain dread her victorious Hand, And ORMOND fills with terror Sea and Land. Hard would it be to lose then ground at home, From such good Seed to see th'Old Tares to come; To see the curst Advice again revive, And the worst Men again prefer'd and thrive; See Old and Modern Whigs again prefer'd, And poor Tom Double fairly hang'd or starv'd. The Negative Prophecy, found under the Ruins of Whitehall. I sing NOT of Jove's mighty Thunder, The New-made Lords, or Vigo Plunder; Nor of the C?ns Godly Frolick, To settle Christ's Church Apostolick; Nor of the Pious Convocation, Clearer than Doves from Gall or Passion: How those Grave Rabbies, to a wonder, Kept Heresies and Schisms under: How Binks and Kimberly did shine In that dark Orb with Rays Divine; With what Devotion and Behaviour, The saucy Priest blasphem'd our Saviour: How each his Talent did exert With Arguments not worth a F?rt, To prove that plainly a Majori, No Reverence was due Superiori. Whether it was for Ostentation, Or to promote our Reformation; Or to repent for telling Tales, And drinking N?ts to th'Pr? of W?s: That M?w, top full of Grace, In Royal Chair refus'd her place. I tell not why the ? content To share with her the Government: Nor do I care how many Scars Our Beaus do bring from Field of Mars; Whether the noisy Fops at Wills, Do go to Hell to pay their Bills. When they'l take Antwerp or Ostend, When Matters on the Rhine will mend, Or when the War will have an End. When Leopoldus will grow Wise, The Swede lay by his French Disguise; The Czar well bang'd to make him quiet; The Poles by Bleeding and low Diet, With the dull Swiss, restor'd agen, Shake off the Ass, and act like Men. Eugenius with his Vet'rans sent, To make the French a Carpi Compliment; When we shall get In?e An A?y, with more Sense: Courtiers have less Knavery, Sea-Captains shew more Bravery; When High-Church Rampant shall agree T'have Partners in their Roguery, J? H? and S?r, with the rest decree, Neither to bribe, nor punish Bribery: When under Cloaks and Cassocks there shall lie Nothing but Faith and sound Divinity; Then shall the Golden Age once more be seen, Then Heaven and Earth shall sing, God save the QUEEN. Occasional Conformity. A proper new Ballad. By a West-Saxon. Occasionly as we discours'd of Queen, and Church, and Nation, Occasionly we took to view that Engine, call'd Occasion. Occasion fram'd for nothing else, but to occasion Mischief; A Cloak to cover Hypocrites, of whom the Devil is chief. Occasion for a Loop-hole serves, whenever there's occasion, To leave Plain-dealing in the lurch, and fly to dear Evasion. The Loyalist may hang himself, and damn's Equivocation, That fusty Ware's now thrown aside, Occasion's all the fashion. Let England prize her Native Wares, and not be for Outcomers; We've home-spun Jesuits of our own, more fine than from St. Omers. These Saints of freshest date devis'd this new Trick, call'd Occasion, By this they have refin'd upon all former Reformation. Dull Martyrs spill their Blood in vain for want of this Device, Sir; By this they might have Heathens been, and Christians in a trice, Sir. Occasion more Faces has upon Occasion surely, Than ever Hugh or Burgess had, who taught the Gospel purely. True Scot, upon Occasion, can look like English Bishop; And Quack out-does, with Whiggish Wares, all such as come to his Shop. Occasion can make a Man, with little or no trouble, Sincere as canting Whitaker, and honest as Tom Double. Occasion permits the Saints occasionly to lye, Sir; And fathom Mysteries too deep for such as you and I Sir. Occasionly they shall conform, occasionly dissent, Sir, Occasionly shall take an Oath to break it with intent, Sir. Occasionly shall go to Church, occasionly to Meeting; Occasionly betray their Lord, while they like Judas greet him. Occasionly deny him too, in open view of Men, Sir; And where's the harm? for when 'tis fit, they own him can agen, Sir. Occasionly communicate, occasionly refrain, Sir; But constantly communicate when 'twill occasion Gain, Sir. When 'twill occasion Godly Men to Parliament to ride-a, And there with great Sincerity to take Occasion's side-a. When 'twill occasion Cheats to scape, and hinder fair Accompting, When 'twill occasion Lets and Rubs, past Honesty's surmounting. On such Occasions they can kneel like rankest Idolaters; But Turn once serv'd, and Place obtain'd, no stiffer Idol-haters. Thus 'casionly for God they are, and 'casionly for Devil, Occasionly for Good again, occasionly for Evil. Occasionly for Heaven bound, occasionly for Hell, Sir; But surely 'twould be sad to have occasion there to dwell, Sir. A Consultation of the Bishops. The attribution of this poem is questionable. To give the last Amendment to the Bill, Which to the Saints portended so much Ill; To curb the Commons, and their Ends defeat, Right Reverend Twelve last night at Lambeth met. Tho much of Lawn did round the Room appear, Yet none but modern Men of God were there, Nor had been mitred more than thirteen Year: The Ten remov'd, the grave Assembly sat, The Bus'ness of the Day was in Debate: This way and that their various Censures tend, And some would pass the Bill, but more would mend. At length, with usual Vehemence, aloud A brawny Bishop thus harangu'd the Croud. Far off from us let Persecution reign; Slav'ry in France, and Bigotry in Spain. The best of Kings the best of Gifts bestow'd, And Toleration by a Law allow'd, And bid us go to God which way we would. Must mod'rate Men from top-Preferments fall, Because they can't agree with us in all? We may esteem the Ore, yet slight the Dross; May be good Christians, yet condemn the Cross; May hate Cathedral Hymns, yet Hopkins sing, And propagate without the Pagan Ring. No doubt this Bill by some well-meaning Men, Was but sent up to be sent down agen. It needs must give weak Consciences offence, Rogues can't be so without a vast Expence. The Sacramental Test caus'd no Debates, That but their Souls, this touches their Estates. Should this Unchristian bitter Bill succeed, 'Twould be a Woe to Hypocrites indeed. Away with't then; 'tis one of Bonner's Bills: I'm not for saving Saints against their Wills. This said, they all with a consenting Nod, The Reformation Writer's Thoughts applaud. When strait a most melodious Sound was heard, And lo! in White a Rev'rend Laud. Form appear'd: A Cross his Hand, a Mitre deck'd his Head; And while sweet Odours round the Room were spread, Thus to them all the Sacred Shadow said: Since Time at length turns up the happy Hour, And Providence has put it in your pow'r, To cote your Flocks, and sever from the Fold The prowling Wolf, will you your hands withhold? Forbid it Heaven! it ever should be said, That the pure Church for which the Martyr bled, And for which too I sacrific'd my Head, Should be by'ts Bishops into Bondage led. Think, such a Time may never come agen, Seldom such Senates, never such a Queen. Your Church's Fate you falsly fear from Rome, Out of the North more likely 'tis to come: One Faith's Defender having hurt it more, Than all the Kings that ever reign'd before. Make then your legal Dams 'gainst Schism so high, No Spring-tides of Succession may destroy. He ceas'd; and lo! a Cloud refulgent bright Bore up the Saint to Realms of lasting Light. Fear and a just Confusion shook each Soul, And Samuel's Truth with trembling fell on all. Shame and Confusion sate on ev'ry Face, And even S?um felt some shocks of Grace. The Heav'nly Vision quite had chang'd their Will, And all without Amendments now would pass the Bill. When strange! After an Earthquake and a flash of Flame, Into the Room a Meager K. W. Phantom came; His bending Bulk, and Purple Robe hung o'er, And he in's hands the Regal Ensigns bore. Struck with Surprize each Rev'rence arose, And Homage paid, and recogniz'd his Nose. When casting on them all a direful Look, With Indignation thus the Spectre spoke. False to your Faith, and your Creation too, To be to what's against your Int'rest true: Have I been labouring thirteen Years and more That to destroy, which you would now restore? Did I not cull you out among the Croud, To make you all Right Rev'rend Things in God? Did I not thro the Surplice see the Saint? Churchmen in show, but Calvins in your Cant; Forc'd you the Chair Episcopal to fill, And Mitred you almost against your Will: And will you now at last Apostatize? Think better on't; my former Friends be wise; Is this a Reign in which you e'er can rise? Can W?ster tell with his Prophetick Vein, When he shall be Lord Almoner again? Do G?ter, Br?tol, or St. Asaph know The happy Time when they shall not be so? Off with the Mask then; boldly now appear The very Men the World once thought you were. This said, in shapeless Air the Royal Bubble broke, And the thin Form their wond'ring Eyes forsook. Prologue to the Musick-meeting in York-buildings. By Dr. G???th. Where Musick, and more pow'rful Beauties reign, Who can support the Pleasure, and the Pain? Here their soft Magick those two Sirens try, And if we listen, or but look, we die. Why should we then the wondrous Tales admire Of Orpheus' Numbers, or of Amphion's Lyre? Behold this Scene of Beauty, and confess The Wonder greater, and the Fiction less. Like Human Victims here we are decreed To worship those bright Altars where we bleed. Who braves his Fate in Fields, must tremble here: Triumphant Love more Vassals makes than Fear. No Faction Homage to the Fair denies, The Right Divine's apparent in their Eyes. That Empire's fix'd, that's founded in Desire; Those Fires the Vestals guard, can ne'er expire. Verses written last Summer at Althrop by the Lord Hallifax, in a blank Leaf of a Waller, upon seeing Vandyke's Picture of the old Lady Sunderland. Vandyke had Colours, Softness, Fire, and Art, When the fair Sunderland inflam'd his Heart: Waller had Numbers, Fancy, Wit and Fire, And Sacharissa was his fond Desire. Why then at Althrop seem her Charms to faint, In these sweet Numbers, and that glowing Paint? This happy Seat a fairer Mistress warms; The shining Offspring has eclips'd her Charms: The different Beauties in one Face we find; Soft Amoret with brightest Sacharissa join'd. As high as Nature reach'd, their Art could soar; But she ne'er made a finish'd Piece before. Upon the same Subject; by a Boy of Fifteen, at Westminster-School. In happy Days was Sacharissa's Reign, When Beauty shone, and did not shine in vain: The Sons of Art could all her Charms express, And rival Nature in the fairest Dress. Vandyke and Waller, warm'd with equal Fire, Touch'd the soft Canvas, and the softer Lyre; And the fair Nymph defies the Pow'r of Time In living Colours, and immortal Rhyme. At Althrop now we see a brighter Flame, And Sacharissa stoops to Churchill's Fame. But where's the skilful Hand that can present Her matchless Form in Numbers, or in Paint? Arts that are rais'd and cherish'd by the Fair, By too great Excellence oppress'd, despair; While meaner Faces triumph over Fate, Superior Beauty has a shorter Date. Yet happy Churchill, that she can't live long In Kneller's Oil, or Hallifax's Song. On the Duke of Savoy's declaring against France. Long has great Lewis form'd the vast Design, Europa's Liberty to undermine: Some he has conquer'd in the Field of War, Tho still himself he kept from Dangers far: Others by Bribes he has his Vassals made; But most of all by Breach of Faith betray'd. Sov'reigns in Battel fam'd for Sums of Gold, Their People, Country, and themselves have sold. Ev'n Savoy's Duke his Neck did seem to bow, And tacitly an universal Throne allow. But O! how hard a thing it is to find A Prince, whom common Principles can bind! By the Example of his Silk-worms taught, T'expire in Fetters which himself had wrought. Of elevated Rank they can despise Those feeble Chains we call Religious Ties. For Int'rest Savoy the French side did take, For Interest as bravely did forsake. The Monarch thus deceiv'd, cry'd out in Rage, (Which Maintenon herself could not assuage:) What! can the Plains of Lombardy produce A Genius equal to the Flow'r-de-Luce? Can there be near the Alps a Hero found, Who scorns to be by Oaths and Treaties bound? A Man of Royal Mould? who wisely knows That Heav'n does laugh at Kings and Lovers Vows? My happy Reign has seen its sixtieth Year, Treaties and Leagues have been my constant care; Which none e'er knew more artfully to make, Nor with more Skill and Judgment when to break: This darling Talent none e'er call'd in doubt, Tho they have dar'd my Courage to dispute. Then Lewis fall! then be for ever dumb! For sure thy fatal Period is come, When keeping Faith betrays thee—. The Toasters. Lady Wharton. When Jove to Ida did the Gods invite, And in immortal Toastings pass'd the Night, With more than Bowls of Nectar they were bless'd, For Venus was the Wharton of the Feast. Lady Essex. The bravest Hero, and the brightest Dame From Belgia's happy Clime Britannia drew; One pregnant Cloud we find does often frame The awful Thunder and the gentle Dew. Lady Essex. To Essex fill the sprightly Wine, The Health's engaging and divine: Let purest Odours scent the Air, And Wreaths of Roses bind our Hair. In her chaste Lips these blushing lie, And those her gentle Sighs supply. Dutchess of St. Albans. The Saints above can ask, but not bestow; This Saint can give all Happiness below. Dutchess of St. Albans. The Line of Vere so long renown'd in Arms, Concludes with Lustre in St. Albans Charms: Her conqu'ring Eyes have made their Race compleat; They rose in Valour, and in Beauty set. Lady Mary Churchill. Fairest and latest of the beauteous Race, Blest with your Parents Wit, and her first blooming Face; Born with our Liberties in William's Reign, Your Eyes alone that Liberty restrain. Lady Hyde. The God of Wine grows jealous of his Art, He only fires the Head, but Hyde the Heart: The Queen of Love looks on, and smiles to see A Nymph more mighty than a Deity. Lady Sunderland. All Nature's Charms in Sunderland appear, Bright as her Eyes, and as her Reason clear: Yet still their Force, to Men not safely known, Seems undiscover'd to herself alone. Lady Harriot Godolphin. Godolphin's easy and unpractis'd Air Gains without Art, and governs without Care: Her conqu'ring Race with various Fate surprize; Who 'scape their Arms, are Captives to her Eyes. Dutchess of Richmond. Richmond has Charms that continue our Claim To lay hold of the Toast that belongs to the Name. Dutchess of Bolton. Love's keenest Darts are charming Bolton's Care, Which the fair Tyrant poisons with Despair: The God of Wine the dire Effect foresees, And sends the Juice that gives the Lover ease. Lady Harper. In Harper all the Graces shine, Gay as our Mirth, and sparkling as our Wine: Here's to the Fair—Were Poison in the Cup, Might she be bless'd, thus would I drink it up. Lady Manchester. While haughty Gallia's Dames, that spread O'er their pale Cheeks an artful Red, Behold this beauteous Stranger there, In native Charms divinely fair; Confusion in their Looks they show'd, And with unborrow'd Blushes glow'd. Mrs. Barton. Stamp'd with her reigning Charms, this Standard-Glass Shall current thro the Realms of Bacchus pass; Full fraught with Beauty shall new Flame impart, And mint her shining Image on the Heart. Mrs. Digby. Why laughs the Wine with which this Glass is crown'd? Why leaps my Heart to hear this Health go round? Digby warms both with Sympathetick Fires; Her Name the Glass, her Form my Heart inspires. Mrs. Digby. No wonder Ladies that at Court appear, And in Front-Boxes sparkle all the Year, Are chosen Toasts; 'twas Digby's matchless Frame, That Cæsar-like but saw and overcame. Mrs. Claverine. Such Beauty join'd with such harmonious Skill, Must doubly charm, then doubly let us fill. If Musick be Love's Food, as Lovers think, When Claverine's nam'd, then Toasting is his Drink. Mrs. Tempest. Venus contending for the Golden Ball, Us'd Helen's Charms to bribe her Judg withal: Had she been bless'd with Tempest's brighter Eyes, Unborrow'd Beauty would have gain'd the Prize. Mrs. Tempest. If perfect Joys from perfect Beauty rise, View Tempest's Shape, her Motions and her Eyes: Undoubted Queen of Love, but Honour's Slave; While thousands languish, she but one can save. Mrs. Long. Fill the Glass, let th'Hautboys sound, While bright Long's Health goes round: With eternal Beauty blest, Ever blooming, still the best; Drink your Glass, and think the rest. Mrs. Di-Kirk. Fair written Name, but deeper in my Heart, A Diamond cannot cut like Cupid's Dart. Quickly the Cordial of her Health apply; For when I cease to toast bright Kirk, I die. Mrs. Di-Kirk. So many Charms Di-Kirk surround, 'Tis pity she's unkind; Her conqu'ring Eyes, not seeing, wound; As Love darts home, tho blind. Mrs. Brudenel. Imperial Juno gave her matchless Grace, And Hebe's youthful Bloom adorns her Face; Bright as the Star that leads the heavenly Host, Brudenel precedes the Glory of the Toast. Mrs. Brudenel. Look on the loveliest Tree that shades the Park, And Brudenel you will find upon the Bark: Look on the fairest Glass that's fill'd the most, And Brudenel you will find the darling Toast: Look on her Eyes, if you their Light can bear, And Love himself you'll find sit toasting there. Mademoselle Spanheim. Admir'd in Germany, ador'd in France, Your Charms to brighter Glory here advance; The stubborn Britons own your Beauty's Claim, And with their native Toasts enroll your Name. Dutchess of Beaufort. Offspring of a Tuneful Sire, Blest with more than mortal Fire; Likeness of a Mother's Face, Blest with more than mortal Grace: You with double Charms surprize, With his Wit, and with her Eyes. Lady Carlisle. Carlisle's a Name can ev'ry Muse inspire, To Carlisle fill the Glass, and tune the Lyre. With his lov'd Bays the God of Day shall crown A Wit and Lustre equal to his own. Lady Carlisle. Behold this Northern Star's auspicious Light! Our fainter Beauties shine not half so bright. Form'd to attract, yet certain to repel, Her Charms are but she guards 'em well. Lady Carlisle. She o'er all Hearts and Toasts must reign, Whose Eyes out-sparkle bright Champain; Or when she will vouchsafe to smile, The Brillant that thus writes Carlisle. Lady Carlisle. At once the Sun and Carlisle took their way, To warm the frozen North, and kindle Day; The Flowers to both their glad Creation ow'd, Their Virtue he, their Beauty she bestow'd. Lady Bridgwater. All Health to her, in whose bright Form we find Excess of Charms with native Meekness join'd; Whose tender Beauty safe in Virtue's Care, Springs from a Race so fruitful of the Fair, That all Antiquity can boast no more, For Venus and the Graces were but four. Mrs. Dashwood. Fair as the blushing Grape she stands, Tempting the Gath'rers ready hands; Blossoms and Fruit in her together meet, As ripe as Autumn, and like April sweet. Lady Carlisle. Great as a Goddess, and of Form Divine, Our Heads we bend, and all our Hearts resign: Like Heav'n she rules with an Imperial Sway, And teaches to adore and to obey. Mrs. Dunch. O Dunch! if fewer with thy Charms are fir'd, Than when by Godfrey's Name thou wast admir'd; 'Tis not that Marriage makes thee seem less fair, But then we hop'd, and now we must despair. Mrs. Dunch. Fair Dunch's Eyes such radiant Glances dart, As warm the coldest Bosom with Desire: Those heav'nly Orbs must needs attract the Heart, Where Churchill's Sweetness softens Godfrey's Fire. Mrs. Guibbons. Could Grecian Masters from the Shades return, To copy Guibbons, 'twould advance their Art; Theirs never made but one with Passion burn, But his best Venus conquers ev'ry Heart. Mrs. Nicholas. Unrival'd Nicholas, whose victorious Eyes Love for a Place of Arms with Darts supply'd, Does on the Toasters like fair Phœbe rise, To rule their Wines, and Passion's mighty Tide. Mrs. Barton. Beauty and Wit strove each in vain, To vanquish Bacchus and his Train; But Barton with successful Charms From both their Quivers drew her Arms; The roving God his Sway resigns, And awfully submits his Vines. Lady Orrery. Here close the List, here end the Female Strife; View her the Dawn of Heav'n, and Joys of Life. Nature to warm the World into Desire, Makes Dorset's Charms in her soft Sex conspire, His youthful Form, and his immortal Fire. Lady Orrery. Phœbus, from whom this Fair her Wit derives, No Toast beholds, tho round the World he drives, That charms so much, or has such Conquest won, As this bright Daughter of his darling Son. The Witchcraft. No wonder Winds more dreadful are by far, Than all the Losses of a twelve Years War: No wonder P?tes do the Church betray, And St?men vote, and act a different way: No wonder Magick Art surrounds the Th?, Old Mother J?ings in her Gr?e is known. Old England's Genius rouze, these Charms dispel, Burn but the Witch, and all is well. Orpheus and Margarita. Hail tuneful Pair! Say by what wond'rous Charms One scap'd from Hell, and one from Greber's Arms. When the soft Thracian struck the trembling Strings, The Winds were hush'd, and furl'd their ruffling Wings: And since the tawny Tuscan rais'd her Strain, R?k furls his Sails, and dozes on the Main; Treaties unfinish'd in the Office sleep, And Sh?el yawns for Orders on the Deep. Thus equal Charms an equal Conquest claim, To him high Woods and bending Timber came, To her shrub H?s and tall N?m. PALLAS. Pallas, destructive to the Trojan Line, Raz'd their proud Walls, tho built with Hands Divine; But Love's bright Goddess with propitious Grace, Preserv'd a Hero to restore the Race: So the fam'd Empire, where the Iber flows, Fell by Eliza, and by Anna rose. The Austrian Eagle. By Mr. Stepney. At Anna's Call the Austrian Eagle flies, Bearing her Thunder to the Southern Skies; Where a rash Prince, with an unequal Sway, Inflames the Region, and misguides the Day: Till the Usurper from his Chariot hurl'd, Leaves the true Monarch to command the World. The Prologue, by way of Dialogue, between Heraclitus Ridens, the Observator, and his Country-man. Spoken by Mr. Powel, Mr. Booth, and Mr. Pack. Heracl. Well—Since we're met, our Business is to try Which is the better Subject, you or I; You that by clipping English, clip the Throne, Or I that regal Power extensive own? Observ. Thou Slave to Scepters, hug thy pleasing Chains, And under no Restriction publish Reigns; Make Crowns unlimited, unquestion'd be, And blame the Queen's best Friend, in blaming me: Thy weak Productions nothing fertile yield, Nor hast thou digg'd like me in Learning's Field. Heracl. The Queen! O mention not that Sacred Word! Thou mean'st the People for thy Sovereign Lord; The Scum of which thou factiously would'st raise, And blend with Royalty by dint of Praise. But thy Designs will unsuccessful prove, She stands possess'd of Power as well as Love, Has those that guard her Rights with watchful Eyes, And sees an Enemy in a Friend's Disguise. Countr. An't please your Worship—How this Fellow prates! He and his Arguments for four Estates: Down with the Beast of Burden with his Pack, And lay him, like John's Wife, upon his Back. Hark you, Friend, whence is this Presumption grown? I have a hugeous mind to rub you down; But that would hinder the Design in view, It is my Master's Task to conquer you. Observ. On Chops of Logick have I lately fed, And quoted far more Books than e'er I read; Have I pretended Bracton to peruse, And made the Laws their Explanation lose: And yet dar'st thou my Knowledg to decry, And with my Learned Observations vie? Oh! Barlipton, furnish me with Sense, And be my Advocates both Mood and Tense; Assert my Cause, and Fallacies provide, To vindicate my dear Republick Side, As I with Major and with Minor rise, And call the Champion forth to syllogize. Heracl. I take the Combat, and accept the Strife; And in the Crown's behalf would wager Life: As I with Loyal Soul defy thy Spleen, And all my Wishes center in the Queen; The Queen descended from so just a Line, That makes her Claim, as are her Thoughts Divine. Observ. Thus by the help of Analytick Sense, And five Pair of true-blue Predicaments; I lay down this for Truth in form Categ? And with Affirmative oppose your Neg. Those that create, may their own Creature blame, And call him to account, when lost to shame: But Kings their Rights from our Creation take, Therefore we may account with Kings we make. Heracl. Your Major's false, as is your Minor bold, And you Positions most audacious hold: Kings cannot err like those of vulgar Soul, All they must needs surpass, that all controul. Observ. If the Queen holds her Title from our Choice, Then Kings are made Elective by our Voice; But English Senates call'd her to the Throne, Therefore Crown'd Heads must our Election own. Heracl. Grant that their Choice confirm'd the Royal Dame, Their Choice was not precedent to her Claim. From Stuart's Race the mighty Princess sprung, A Race that ever shall demand my Song; That has her Heroes and her Martyrs giv'n, And with unnumber'd Princes peopled Heav'n: Tho blacken'd by thy Pen, their Deeds are stain'd, And thou no Hero own'st, or Martyr reign'd. Observ. Think of my Wrongs, and I must stand excus'd; How has that Family our Sect abus'd! Suppress'd our Hopes, and our Ambition quell'd, And Force by Force unhappily repell'd. How from Sedition has this Land been purg'd, And I my self been sentenc'd to be scourg'd? Fin'd for High-Treason, more than I could pay, And close confin'd with all this Tympany of Clay. Heracl. Thy Wrongs dost call what thou shouldst term thy Crimes; Thou Scandal to the past and present Times; Thou Western Rebel, undeserving Grace, Deform'd in Soul, and horrible in Face: Thou Reprobate from factious Parents sprung, Whose Father taught for what thy Spouse's hung. That Prince was gracious, as his Birth was true, And ne'er did more amiss than sparing you: Had he but granted what you humbly sought, And hang'd you like your Kinsman for your Fault, You had not liv'd to deal about your Spleen, And wrong him dead in his Remains the Queen. Observ. Dare but assert what thou hast lately spoke, Slaughter's the Word, and wait th'impending Stroke; With Hand and Heart erected see me frown, The People I affirm should awe the Crown. Heracl. Thy Frowns and Smiles I equally despise, He that talks most of Fighting oftnest flies: Cowards are ever Champions in pretence, As Fools in their Opinion Men of Sense. Boast of thy Courage where there's none to fight, Neither thy Pen nor Staff can do thee Right. What hast thou not malignant daily spread? How not defam'd the Living with the Dead? By thee twice martyr'd Royal Charles is known, And more than twice exil'd his hapless Son; Injur'd, traduc'd in Person and in Fame, And impiously deny'd a Subject's Claim; Tho he might undisturb'd in silence rest, And having suffer'd here, in Death be bless'd. By thee the Grand-daughter's precarious made, Able to govern us without thy Aid; Wise as she's Just, and providently Good, To save her Peoples Treasure with their Blood. Observ. Thou base High-flier, and Tantivy Fiend, Dar'st thou to Popish Ashes be a Friend? Know I'll inform, for I am skill'd in Harms, And when my Foes appear can sound Alarms; Can swear, accuse the Persons that are clear, And make great Men 'fore greater Men appear. Heracl. Well have I known thy Conduct and thy Life, Ever contending thou art still at strife; In all Conditions infamous and loose, Ready to burst with Hatred and Abuse; Unlearn'd, yet others eager to direct, The Laystall to receive the Offals of thy Sect; Whose idle Schemes thy hungry Labours lard, And aim at Governments they say they guard. Countr. I'faith, the Man talks notably, and well, And like my Team's Forehorse will bear the Bell; 'Slife, I could almost venture to desert, And with this oaken Towel take his part. And so I will—You, Master, may be gone, Good-night—You are no more to visit Joan— Dine at my Farm, or feed on Roast and Boil'd, That have my Loyalty and Truth defil'd. [Here the Countryman walks off, and compliments Heraclitus.] Observ. On pain of Scandal issuing from my Pen, Return to thy old Principles agen; If thou wouldst follow Precepts just and right, Without the odious Name of Jacobite. Not that I want Assistance to defend Those Arguments no Casuist can mend; But for thy Good these Precepts I bestow, Therefore thy wonted Prudence wisely show: Like the bright Moon at Midnight I appear, And unconcern'd my wonted Lustre wear; Tho barking Curs, offended at my Light, Bawl at my Splendor with successless Spight. Countr. Hey day! You're fit indeed to teach us Rules, And to make Saints of Men, and Men of Fools, That steal from Sign-posts, and Reproaches take From Houses fam'd for Custard, and for Cake: There's not a Prentice-boy, but knows from whence You borrow this bright Argument of Sense, That has on Farthing-pyes on Sunday fed, And on the House's Sign these Lines has read: Ye bawling Dogs, why bark you so, Since I am high, and you are low? Heracl. Fear not, my Friend, his Doctrines to disclaim, Yours will the Credit be, and his the Shame; For Crimes are pass'd Repentance will suffice, Then as you've been inveterate, be wise; Be watchful for th'Establish'd Church and State, And pay Allegiance where you paid your Hate. Countr. And so I will—But first it is but fit, He that has thus seduc'd me, should be beat. Villain, away—No more Sedition prate, Spite of thy bulky Club I'll thwack thy Pate. Hence in an instant to thy Garret gang, And like despairing Judas, laugh and hang Beats him off the Stage.. He's gone—Now Master, I espouse your Cause, And am a Convert to the Throne and Laws. Heracl. Protect them still, ye Powers that both maintain, And make them flourish in this glorious Reign; The best of Queens, and most belov'd of Names, The best of Subjects, and of Wishes claims. The Epilogue upon the Observator. Spoken by Mr. Powell. The Stage has been, and yet improv'd shall rise, Instructive to your Ears and to your Eyes; Tho factious Pens industrious to their Shame, Against its Precepts, and its Use declaim; Well knowing that Our Scenes Their Vice expose, And Comedy put down, Rebellion rose. Thus 'twas in Cromwel's Regicidal Days, Th' Usurper could not bear the Stings of Plays; Goodness they taught, when Goodness he'd abuse, And with the Sovereign was exil'd the Muse: And thus 'twould be again, were Cromwel's Friends Suffer'd once more to gain their hateful Ends; Religion with the Drama would decline, And things Immoral elbow things Divine. Oh! were he here, that's made the Party's Scribe, With all the starvling Authors of the Tribe, Aw'd by your Charms, his Scandal he'd disown, And humbly for Offences past atone; As in this Circle, beauteous to the View, He might see Virtues shine in seeing you; Tho now he Prynn and Calvin weekly gleans, And damns his Paper to condemn our Scenes. E'en let the Fool go on, and snarling grin, And turn Reformer when he's sunk in Sin; Like Holy Cheats in Times of Forty One, Who with Heav'n's Name their hellish War begun, Profanely call'd upon all piercing Eyes, To see 'em against Heav'n's Vicegerent rise; As from his Pen Sedition falls in Show'rs, His Character's so low, 'twill heighten ours. Yet shall the Wretch not unregarded rail, Bloated and gorg'd with Impudence and Ale; But to be fam'd for what he is, be shewn As Monsters are expos'd to all the Town: For he can none but Monsters Tempers share, That starts not to calumniate what is fair; That slights the Beauteous, and defames the Great, By calling where you sit, the Devil's Seat. How can this be the Place the Scribler means? I see no Presbyterian at our Scenes, No Commonwealths-man with Geneva Grace, And all the Saints assembled in his Face. Hold, let me see—not one in all the Pit— Except some eighteen Pennymen of Wit— Sure all the Malice he profusely vents, Aims at the Tipling-houses he frequents; Where Smoke, and Derby, Oaths and Nonsense reign, Fit Places for a Saint of Godly strain; Where Anarchy confus'dly takes its Seat, And he sees that in Little, he would see in Great. It must be so, for nothing else could make So mean, so scandalous and empty Rake, So void of Sense, impertinent and dull, With all the Party's Vacancy of Skull, That ne'er admitted Modesty or Wit, Or the least Interval of Learning bit; That pores o'er Statutes, Statutes to pervert, And shew his want of Nature and of Art. You that are here can the best Answers make, An Audience flings the Scoundrel on his Back; In a full House his Ignorance will be shown, And the Malignant's weak Endeavours known: And a full House is in his Audience gain'd, That lessens Arguments by him maintain'd; Tho he persists malicious in his Tongue, And steals from Regicides that justly hung. Let him write on, your Favour's our Defence, Well knows the Fool to wage a War with Sense, To strike at what does base Rebellion blame, And pays the Regal Throne the Regal Claim; In your Support we no Assistance want, Nor dread the wooden Tool with wooden Plant; Punish'd is he with Scarcity of Brains, And Penury of Goodness for his Pains: Just like a Fiend, who in Distraction lies, And curses Heav'n to which he cannot rise; As in your Smiles all Goodness he surveys, And sinks himself beyond the reach of Praise. A Prologue sent to Mr. Row, to his new Play, call'd, The Fair Penitent. Design'd to be spoken by Mr. Betterton, but refus'd. Est &amp; in Obscænos deflexa Tragœdia Risus. Ovid. Quacks set out Bills, Jack-Pudding makes Harangues, And Thief, at Tyburn, speaks before he hangs: I pray you then give ear to what I say, For this to me is Execution-day. Tyburn the Stage is, Boxes, Galleries, Pit, Where you, our Judges, and our Hangman sit; Of Nonsense tender, tho severe to Wit. To-day we fear you not, we've hit your Taste, And when that's pleas'd, we cannot sure be cast. Meanly contented with the vulgar Way, Some make the Heroine, Virtuous in a Play: But the bold tragick Genius of our Stage, With Novelty resolves t'oblige the Age, And with a The Heroine of his Play lies with a Fellow before Marriage, continues the Intrigue two Years after, and is propos'd as the Picture of the Ladies by the Author, &amp;c. Heroine Punk the Ladies will engage. He from the Sock, the PROSTITUTE transplants, And swells the humble Whore with Buskin'd Rants. His Whore, indeed, repents the slippery Fault; But, like the rest, it is not, till she's caught. She is not sorry, that she'as play'd the Whore, But that, discover'd, she can do't no more. Thus, while his Punk his Buskins boldly ramps, Like Bajazet, his Hero cuckol'd stares and stamps. He with no Laurel Wreaths his Brow adorns, But, while those vulgar Ornaments he scorns, Above his Brethren he exalts his Horns. Confederate Cuckolds then come clap this Play! Our lucky Bard devotes to You this Day. No The Comick Cuckolds, which the Stage till now only knew. Doodle, The Comick Cuckolds, which the Stage till now only knew. Dashwood, The Comick Cuckolds, which the Stage till now only knew. Wiseacre is here, Or any of the puny Race, that us'd t'appear. The Cuckold now assumes a haughtier Air, With brandish'd Dagger stabs the yielding Fair, So little Woman's Frailty is his Care. Ye horned Herd, from Wapping to Whitehall, Approach, in Triumph, he invites You all; So strong a Party made, he cannot fear his Fall. Some envious Critick here perhaps exclaims, If you shou'd punish thus the City-Dames, You'd make a Desolation in the Land, And Bars, and Counters, would unfurnish'd stand. But, Ladies, you with Ease that Fear remove, If you use Caution in the Thefts of Love: Since only she that's caught that Punishment will prove. Danger adds Fewel to the amorous Fire, And Difficulties only raise Desire. Besides, past Merits you shou'd not despise, For In the Step Mother. Solomon, and Tamerlane. William in disguise, From his lov'd Pen regal'd your Ears and Eyes. What tho nor Art, nor Nature, there were found, He scorns by Art or Nature to be bound. Let others toil beneath the Load of Thought Of what is Just, what Natural, what not; They're dull, mechanick Things, below Regard, From such a Bold, and such a Lucky Bard. Uncumber'd with those Fetters still he'll write, While Ignorance ensures his hood-wink'd flight. He fears no Danger, for he none foresees, In happy Ignorance secure to please, Without their Foreign Aid, th'Indulgent Town, With Heroes and with Language, all his own. The hooded Falcon, so, in haste let fly, Tow'rs swift aloft, undaunted, to the Sky, With upright Wing, till lost to human Eye. From THRONES he sauntering, talking Heroes chose, But for an active Heroine now rakes the STEWS; And whence he'l fetch the Next—he only knows: Yet A famous Baud of 30 Years ago. Creswell, sure, of infamous Renown, Or some more antique Matron of this Town, May reasonably next invoke his Pen, To do her Justice in his LOFTY SCENE. Nor can she, sure, his Lofty Scene disgrace, Since Baud, in breeding, still of Whore takes place. For Baud's arriv'd to the grave Doctor's State, While Whore is but an Under-Graduate; Baud's maudlin Tone, from penitential Cart, Like Thespis, Founder of the Tragick Art, Must have the Force to move each amorous Heart. But what is it that Poets cannot do, Caress'd by Us, and so extol'd by You? T' encourage MERIT nobly you disdain, It is pedantick, and below your Vein: And faith, to tell the Truth, We love our Gain. As with the Saints, so 'tis, we find, with You, For here, alas! th'Elect are very few, And those without your Reason, by your Will sav'd too. The less of proper Merit they can boast, The more secure they are from being lost. While Farce and Bombast best can please the Age, We'll cook no other Dishes for the Stage. When to your Smiles just Poets you admit, And flock in Shoals to Nature, and to Wit; All Poetasters then we will discard, And here encourage only the true Bard. For, sure, in Us, it must seem Impudence, To cherish Merit, and to play good Sense, When from Your Taste we hope for all our Pence. Epilogue to the Ladies, spoke by Mr. Wilks at the Musick-Meeting in Drury-Lane, where the English Woman sings. Written by Mr. Manwaring upon the occasion of their both singing before the Queen, and K. of Spain at Windsor. With Joy we see this Circle of the Fair, Since the late Trial of the tuneful Pair; Your Country's Friends, you love the Native Strains Of Musick here, where England's Genius reigns. In other Walls tho Harmony be found, You know it's foreign, and disdain the Sound. Who haunt new Consorts, Faction would create, And are Dissenters in Apollo's State: They shun our Stages where he keeps his Court, And to some gloomy Meeting-house resort. While you with Duty own his rightful Cause, And guard this Place establish'd by his Laws. But now your Charms a nobler Task pursue, And Spain a Revolution waits from You; That blooming Hero you at Courts admir'd, In Arms must triumph, by your Praises fir'd: Success is Yours, and Victory inclines Still to that side on which your Favour shines. Mars will himself conduct our future Wars, When every Venus for this Prince declares; When freely serving this well-weigh'd Design, Our Nation's Treasure and its Beauty join. Yet when this happy Scheme by Wisdom wrought, Is by his Valour to Perfection brought; And his glad Subjects shall their King receive, Grac'd with a Crown which Anne alone could give; Reflecting then what Wonders he had seen, The Court, these Beauties, and our glorious Queen; That warm Idea he shall still retain, And think, tho seated on the Throne of Spain, Tho with the Treasure of both Indies crown'd, He left a brighter Empire than he found. Spoken by the Genius of England. When shall I be at rest? will pleasing Peace No more return to smile on my Recess? Must hateful Jars and dire Contentions reign, And High-Church Parties rule the British Main? Shall Mother Church be still the specious Bait For crafty Villains to destroy the State? And will ye tamely with the Traitors side, Who thus your Land occasion'ly divide? Will ye to wreck, ye Britons, give the Realm, Whilst Bourb—Pilots steer the yielding Helm? Shall Faction dare to spread its baneful Seed, And will no Patriot on the Monster tread, To crush to Atoms its aspiring Head? For shame, ye Britons, now your Feuds decline, Nor swallow with such ease a French Design: Let your just Rage upon your Foes be shown, In Gallick Blood your just Resentments drown, But rend not with such Strife the harmless Town. 'Tis you, ye Tories, who this Heat foment, Railing at Millions by Low-Church-men spent, Whilst your dear selves have just the same intent. This is the only difference can be seen, They spent to keep th'French out, you'd spend to let them in. Ye are the Church's Bullies, who have made Such noise to have its Mint and Anice paid; Whilst Clemency and Peace, its purest Springs, Ye turn aside as idle useless things. Too long, too long have your pernicious Wiles Been practis'd on this hapless Land; your Smiles Suspected grow; nay, e'en a common Eye, Without a Glass your Actions may descry, Too deeply ting'd with Fraud and Villany. Tell us the cause of all your loud Complaints; We know you well, tho ye wou'd seem such Saints: Papists Socinians, Atheists, Arians, all Do for the Church unanimously baul. Alas, poor Church! how art thou fallen of late, When such as these must prop thy sinking State! Lest honest Whigs the Church should undermine And Anarchy succeed— Or, what they hate as bad, the lawful Line. Delude us then no more with idle Tales, But say expresly, that the Prince of W? Ye to th'Imperial Power would advance, And basely court the Grand Monarch of France. This, Tories, is your Aim, but learn to fear, Whilst my lov'd Britons Nassau's Name revere; The Throne shall be secure from spurious Race, And Perkin shall to Hannover give place. Prologue spoken at Court before the Queen, on Her Majesty's Birth-day, 1703/4. Shine forth, ye Planets, with distinguish'd Light, As when ye hallow'd first this Happy Night; Again transmit your friendly Beams to Earth, As when Britannia joy'd for ANNA's Birth. And thou, kind Star, whose Tutelary Pow'r Guided the future Monarch's Natal Hour, Thy Radiant Voyages for ever run; Only less bless'd than Cynthia and the Sun: With thy fair Aspect still illustrate Heav'n, Kindly preserve what thou hast greatly giv'n. Thy Influence for thy ANNA we implore; Prolong one Life, and Britain asks no more. For what can Virtue more to Man express, Than to be great in War, and good in Peace? What further Thought of Blessing can we frame, Than that That Virtue should be still the same? Entire and sure the Monarch's Rule must prove, Who founds her Greatness on her Subjects Love; Who does our Homage for our Good require, And orders that which we should first desire. Our vanquish'd Wills that pleasing Force obey; Her Goodness takes our Liberty away, And haughty Britain yields to Arbitrary Sway. Let the young Austrian then her Terrors bear, Great as He is, her Delegate in War; Let him in Thunder speak to both his Spains, That in these dreadful Isles a Female reigns. Whilst the bright Queen does on her Subjects show'r The gentle Blessings of her softer Pow'r; Gives glorious Morals to a vicious Age, To Temples Zeal, and Manners to the Stage: Bids the chaste Muse without a Blush appear, And Wit be that which Heav'n and she may hear. Minerva thus to Perseus lent her Shield, Secure of Conquest, sent him to the Field; Told him how barb'rous Rage should be restrain'd, And bid him execute what she ordain'd. Mean time the Deity in Temples sat, Fond of her Native Grecians future Fate; Taught 'em in Laws and Letters to excel, In acting justly, and in writing well. Thus whilst the Goddess did her Pow'r dispose, The World was freed from Tyrants, Wars and Woes; Virtue was taught in Verse, and Athens rose. The History and Fall of the Conformity-Bill. Being an excellent new Song, to the Tune of Chivy-Chase. God bless our gracious Sovereign ANNE, For so I shall her call, Who ruleth in our English Land, An English Heart withal, The Prince, her Turtle Mate, I trow, I also pray God bless: And eke the Duke of Marlborough, Both his and her good Grace. And now I think within this Realm I need pray for no more; For they who do sit at the Helm; Are two out of these four. And yet I mayn't omit the Church, To pray for in my Pray'rs, Which has of late been left i'th' lurch By her own Sons and Heirs. Ah Bishops! Bishops! you I mean, They say you were possess'd, As one may say, like Birds unclean, To foul thus your own Nest. For unto you a choice Bill came, Sent from the Commons House, And yet you did reject the same, As if not worth a Louse. And now to tell I do intend, How they this Bill did bring in, By that you'll find the very end Of this my Tale's beginning. Few happy in this World there are, And fewer in the next; The first Experience does declare, The last the Gospel-Text. And therefore some Great Men of Note, Whom I shall name anon, Did in the Senate stoutly vote For Christian Union. Now Conscience is a thing we know Like to a Mastiff Dog, Which if ty'd up so fierce he'll grow, He'll bite his very Clog. Wherefore some wiser Men than some, Thought they could give good Reason, How that this Bill just now did come A little out of season. Dissenters they were to be press'd To go to Common-Prayer, And turn their Faces to the East, As God were only there: Or else no place of Price or Trust They ever could obtain; Which shews that Saying very just, That Godliness is Gain. Now some I say did think this hard, And strove with all their Might, That Subjects might not be debar'd Of Freedom, nor of Right. For who can think our Lord can care From whence the Voice does sound, Tho we should pray as Seamen swear, The Compass Points around? Sure he, I say, our Pray'rs can hear, Whenever we do call; For if so be the Heart's sincere, Oh that is all in all. But yet to see how the World goes, Right is by Might devour'd; And they who did this Bill oppose, Alas! were overpow'r'd. St. Stephen first was in degree, That Persecution felt; And persecuted so was he, He better had been gelt. Oh! better had it been for he, I'll say while I have breath, Ten times unstoned for to be, Than stoned unto Death. But let that pass, and mark me well; For things unknown before, And strange and true I now shall tell, Or ne'er believe me more. How Stephen stoned was you've heard; Now to atone that Guilt, A Chappel of those Stones is rear'd, By which his Blood was spilt. And Stephen's Chappel is it hight, And stands in Westminster, Near to that place where want of sight Makes Justice sometimes err. Now how these Stones make hard the Heart Of Burgess, or of Knight; And do by Influence impart Their persecuting Spight; It's hard to tell the Cause thereof, Like other Mysteries; Nor would I aim at that, although That I were ne'er so wise. But yet 'tis true, or tell me now, How could such Zeal inspire Sir E? S?r, or J? H? Of Gloucestershire Esquire; With divers Men of lesser Note, Tho equal in Desert; Who did their Voices for to Vote, With Clamours loud exert. None of whose Lives I think can boast, That they have much Religion; Or value more the Holy Ghost Than Mahomet his Pigeon. Ev'n H?y's self, I say, would scarce Be made a Smithfield Martyr; For proof, clap Faggots to his A? You'll find you've caught a Tartar. Now this same Bill compleatly cook'd, To the Peers House is follow'd; And they who brought it thither look'd It forthwith should be swallow'd. But as a hasty Pudding's spoil'd, If there do fall some Soot in't; Or if burnt to: So this was spoil'd By Bishop B?t's Foot in't. For he with Toe Episcopal Thereto gave such a Zest, Their Lordships strait grew squeamish all, Nor could the same digest. In vain brisk N? did speak, Who is so tall and slim; In vain did G? silence break, Who is so like to him. Their Words, alas! went for no more Than does the News of Grubster, Or than in Commons House before Went H?s Voice the Shrubster. The wise and valiant Lord of th'North, With little better Luck, In windy Words did bluster forth, So did his Grace of Buck. For to tell Truth, some Peers did smoke, That this same Bill's Progression Might by degrees at length have broke The Protestant Suc?on. Such Snakes in Grass were for to bite Those who could not discern 'em; Wherefore this Bill was kick'd out quite, Pro nunc &amp; sempiternum. Now God preserve our Queen, I say, And grant her long to reign; And God keep Popery, I pray, On t'other side the Main. [And grant Presbytery may stay, And all the canting Breed, For ever, and also for ay, On t'other side the Tweed.] Sic Cecinit Rob. Wisdom. Lackworth's Lively Character. It shall be known how Lackworth came so Great, And why he's thought no better than a Cheat. He has more Faults than I'll pretend to tell; But this, his Masterpiece, was hatch'd in Hell. His curs'd Address, address'd a Knight to be, None but himself could act such Villany. And now's his time to get, and cheat a Wife, Which this State-Quack did nicely to the Life. Madam, quoth he, the King will be more kind, Some grand Imployment is for me design'd; And then an Earl, or Duke I shall be made: Fond to be great, thus greatly she's betray'd. The M? Adventure next appears in view; What Crouds of Fools into that Mine he threw: Tho then or since he ne'er was on the Spot, Yet cou'd cut out to every one his Lot, Thrice fifty thousand Pounds by it he'as got. Besides what by his Coals he makes a Year, Transfers and Ways which do not yet appear. This Pettyfogger thinks he cannot be Call'd to account by Law or Equity. But there's a Parliament can give relief, To those who have been robb'd by such a Thief. And if these will not do, there's one way more To make him, what he'as basely got, restore. Should any cheat me thus but of one Groat, They should repent, or else— But stay my Muse, and praise him if you can, He has done more than e'er was done by Man. Let none doubt that Philosophers of old Transmuted baser Metals into Gold, Since this most mighty Briton does much more, Into coin'd Gold transmutes the Name of Oar. SONG. [Not, Celia, that I am more just] Not, Celia, that I am more just, Or truer than the rest; For I could change each hour like them, Were it my Interest. But I am ty'd to very Thee, By ev'ry Thought I have; Should you again my Heart set free, I'd be again your Slave, For all in Woman is ador'd, In thy dear Self I find; For the whole Sex can but afford The Handsom and the Kind. Then why should I seek further Store, And make my Love anew? Since Change it self can give no more, 'Tis easy to be true. The Old Man's Wish. If I live to grow old, as I find I go down, Let this be my Fate in a Country Town: May I have a warm House, with a Stone at my Gate, And a cleanly young Girl to rub my bald Pate. May I govern my Passion with an absolute Sway, And grow wiser and better as my Strength wears away, Without Gout or Stone, by a gentle Decay. In a Country Town, by a murm'ring Brook, With th'Ocean at distance on which I may look; With a spacious Plain without Hedg or Stile, And an easy Pad-nag to ride out a Mile. May I govern, &amp;c. With Horace and Plutarch, and one or two more Of the best Wits that liv'd in the Ages before; With a Dish of Roast-Mutton, not Ven'son nor Teal, And clean tho coarse Linen at ev'ry Meal. May I govern, &amp;c. With a Pudding on Sunday, and stout humming Liquor, And Remnants of Latin to puzzle the Vicar; With a hidden Reserve of Burgundy Wine, To drink the King's Health as oft as we dine. May I govern, &amp;c. With a Courage undaunted may I face my last Day, And when I am dead, may the better Sort say, In the Morning when sober, in the Evening when mellow, He is gone, and han't left behind him his Fellow; For he govern'd his Passion, &amp;c. On the Countess of Dorch???er. By the Earl of D???t. Proud with the Spoils of Royal Cully, With false pretence to Wit and Parts; She swaggers like a batter'd Bully, To try the Tempers of Mens Hearts. Tho she appear as glitt'ring fine, As Gems, and Jests, and Paint can make her; She ne'er can win a Breast like mine, The Devil and Sir David take her. A SIGH. Gentlest Air, thou Breath of Lovers, Vapour from a secret Fire; Which by thee it self discovers, E'er yet daring to aspire. Softest Note of whisper'd Anguish, Harmony's refined Part, Striking while thou seem'st to languish, Full upon the Listner's Heart. Softest Messenger of Passion, Stealing thro a Croud of Spies; Which constrain the outward Fashion, Close the Lips, and guard the Eyes. Shapeless Sigh, we ne'er can shew thee Form'd, but to assault the Ear; Yet e'er to their cost they know thee, Ev'ry Nymph may read thee here. A F????t. Gentlest Blast of ill Concoction, Reverse of high-ascending Belch, The only Stink abhor'd by Scotch-men, Belov'd and practis'd by the Welch. Softest Note of inward Griping, Sir Reverence's finest Part: So fine it needs no pains of wiping, Except it be a Brewer's F?t. Swiftest Ease of Cholick Pains, Vapour'd from a secret Stench, That's rattled by the unbred Swains, But whisper'd by the bashful Wench. Shapeless F?t, we ne'er can shew thee, But in that noble Female Sport; In which by burning blue we know thee, Th' Amusement of the Maids at Court. The Petition of the distress'd Merchants of London, to the Lord High Treasurer, against the Commissioners of the Customs. From Go?n, that Wasp, whose Talent is Notion; From snarling Tool Cl?ke, at the other's Devotion; From Republican Ben, the old Clergy Teazer, Whose true Christian Name, you must know, 's Abenezer: From flatt'ring false H?y, who sneeks to Church-Party, And for but half Salary vows to be hearty: From fearful proud N?port, who spits out his Curses; From T?dy Bully C?ford, and the Rogues that he nurses; From so motly a Crew, so imperious a Board, Deliver this lab'ring Country, good Lord, And thy Staff shall like Hercules' Club be ador'd. And that no grain of Merit fall by this Petition, Leave Manwaring only to grace the Commission. The Way to Heaven in a String: Or, Mr. Asgil's Argument Burlesqu'd. To the Reader. We have of late been entertain'd with many pretty Whims in Divinity; but this is the finest of them all: A Religious Piece of Knight-Errantry, to which, if I said any thing at all, I thought it must be in Burlesque; for the Humour is comical enough. Pity it is this wondrous Man had not liv'd in the Infancy of Time, and taught poor Mortals this Lesson, e'er Death for so many Thousands of Years had ravaged the habitable parts of the World, and glutted it self with the Spoils of Mankind. The Scythe of Death had then a long time ago been rusty and useless, and the Sands in the Glass of Time had run to no purpose. But we of these latter Ages of the World must have the only Advantage of his Project, who will not go out of the World in the Common Road of his Neighbours, but in a manner peculiar to himself, Hinc itur ad Astra. Bootatus &amp; Spurratus ire ad Cœlum; away mounts our Friend John, and leaves this declining World lessening out of sight. These are the first Lines that ever I attempted in Doggrel, and according to their Reception in the World, perhaps may be the last. The Design will bear a great many more; and my Lines flow as the learned Dr. Bunyan says of his, They came to mine own Heart, thence to my Head, Thence to my Fingers ends they trickeled; Thence to my Pen, and then immediately On Paper I did dribble it daintily. There are some things accounted Real, In which we Mortals do agree all: Things form'd by cunning Allegories, We do account to be mere Stories. Some write of Fights of Mice and Frogs, And others prate of Mastiff Dogs: One has the Fairy Queen espy'd, And told the Tale, as if he ly'd, Of Tib and Tom, and Mib and Mab, Names ne'er attain'd by Poet Squab. But while such Fools do please Mens Fancies With idle Canto's of Romances, I'll tell you of a greater Knight Than e'er made Love, or mov'd in Fight. He neither was a Priest nor Parson, Or Warrior's Saddle laid his Arse on; Yet in Divinity profound, He could great Sophisters confound; Knew difference 'twixt the Jews and Turks, And had read Learned Bunyan's Works: Had Brooks his Golden Pippins read, And by the wiser Folk 'tis said, He can as learnedly dispute As Parson Keith, or fam'd Giles Shute. He sagely in his Youth foresaw That Truths Divine need Props of Law; To study which he did adhere, And in't became a Barister: He something else at length became, An Office got I must not name; Ne Sutor ultra Crepidam. He never bow'd his stubborn Knee In any Feats of Chivalry, Despising such Knight-Errantry, Where People for the very nonce Do fracture one another's Bones; As Bullocks fight in Marshes fed, To try which has the hardest Head. He never lov'd the dismal Sounds Of murd'ring Guns, of Blood and Wounds: He still abhor'd the frightful Sight, The sad Effect of cruel Fight. He never got a broken Head, Or for a Wound had Plaister spread; Had no Mischance in any Points, To dislocate his nimble Joints; But such Disasters as befal In Battels Metaphysical; Which, tho securing Head and Snout, Do craze the Brains, not beat 'em out. By a deep Insight in Religion He found how Mahomet, and his Pigeon, Did fly from hence to blest Abodes, Translated to the very Gods; With ev'ry Pinion not unhing'd, And not one Feather of 'em sing'd. In Sacred Scripture he had read How Enoch and Elijah fled To Heav'n by Faith, and in their flying Disdain'd the common way of dying; Which does Mankind in Thraldom fetter, Only because they know no better. He and his Printer did agree To set Men from this Bondage free; And now Sir Knight has got a Squire, As fit as e'er he could desire: To preach this Doctrine would be vain, Disturb the Head, and Lungs would strain. Let Parsons preach, and Clerks go whistle, They'll do the Business by Epistle, Which has of late gain'd Proselytes Of Tolandists and Asgilites, Who form new Articles Divine, Exceeding far our Thirty Nine. In London Town there's scarcely found One Corner of that fertile Ground, Which does not to the Age afford New Sects all founded on the Word; Who like Logicians do dispute, And one another still confute; All of 'em Orthodox, and all Alike are Apostolical. But tho they make such zealous pother, Some do thrive better than the other; As Plants more generous are found To flourish best in fattest Ground: Some tall ones scatter do their Seed, And new ones do as Maggots breed; Whilst these to height are always shoving, Some others only are improving. St. Paul's scarce outdoes Salters-Hall, Tho its high Roof be far more tall: Octavo Band, and Cloak Divine, As Folio Cassock is as fine: The little Roundhead looks as big As Bishop in his powder'd Wig. And eke a wondrous Reformation Is happen'd in this godly Nation. After a many stubborn Greetings, The King is pray'd for in the Meetings, That he may live long in the Nation; Of publick Funds a long Duration: For these no King did e'er adore, But what increas'd their private Store. Pardon, good Reader, I digress, 'Tis common in Pindarick Verse, And eke in this it must be too, If I but please to make it so; And I, without a Reason for't, Will make 'em long, or cut 'em short. Poets are Princes in their Station, Altho they govern not the Nation; No Man their Power did yet dispute, But always held 'em absolute. Now had Sir Knight his Brain imploy'd How he might conquer, and avoid Old Death, that cunning subtle Fox, Who lays Mankind in earthly Stocks: Says he, good Squire, it is but Folly To sit thus pensive, melancholy; Put but my Notions into print, We'll conquer Death, or Devil's in't. I am Robustick, tho I'm Civil, And grown a Match e'en for the Devil. The crooked Serpent, who by Lying Entices Mankind into Dying, So far does foolish Men deceive, They cannot the dull Custom leave. Had they but Faith, they need not die, Like Enoch might ad Astra fly, And view the Regions of the Sky. But here the Squire to Knight reply'd, You have not yet your Notion try'd: Your mighty Faith your Sense enthrals, 'Tis Philosophically false; For what is born must surely die, Or else Philosophers do lye: All that is nourish'd is unstable, And is revera corruptible; And Death, deciding of the Strife, Is but Corruption of our Life. You must not Notions, Sir, espouse That do the Bonds of Nature loose; And with such Vehemence dispute 'em, When e'ery Church-yard does confute 'em. Besides, Sir, where is your Protection Against received Resurrection? For it appears to all the Wise, If we don't die we shall not rise. You may for this be brought in Court, And there be made to answer for't; They'll use you there like any Dog, When you're once seiz'd by Robin Hog: For, Sir, the Liberty to scribble Allows you not at Church to nibble; And there I'll leave you in the lurch, When you plant Cannons 'gainst the Church. Such things as these would whilome tear yo, In the late Reign of Great Rogero: Not that Rogero of great Note, Of whom Orlando justly wrote, Who with Alcyna did discourse By Assignations of Amours; But that Rogero which did fill The World with Observators ill; Who such ill Tenents to redress, Was made Oppressor of the Press; Who tho he's outed of his Reign, His Squire's Power does still remain. To this reply'd the doughty Knight, Thou shalt not me with Fancies fright. Nought that's heroick, or that's rare-a, But was atchiev'd by Great Don Zara, Whose Actions gave his Name a Hogo, He got the Title of Del Fogo; And tho he was a Man of Valour, He oft was squeez'd by Fortune's Squallor; And Sancho too (his Fates be thanked) Was sadly tossed in a Blanket: Yet these did ne'er repine at Fate, To keep off Blow would scarce guard Pate. I will encounter Jews and Turks, Defy the Devil and his Works, Both thy Rogero, and his Squire, And their Ecclesiastick Fire. Roger belong'd unto that Priesthood, Which never yet did do the least good: He was a Light to the Dark-Lanthorns, Which neither Sockets have, nor han't Horns. If these my Notions do molest, It's Persecution, Sir, at best; Of modern Date a Law too saith, No Man shall suffer for his Faith. Here did the Squire long stand amaz'd; And after on the Knight had gaz'd, Quoth he, it is not Persecution, When against you in Execution: Our Laws do only favour weak And infant Christians, who can't take The stronger Meats; but you are strong, Almost Omnipotent in Wrong. Your self-applauding Vanity Is mere downright Profanity: You know a wondrous deal of Faith, But not one word the Scripture saith. 'Tis true, good Enoch and Eliah Alive to Saints above did fly-a; And this was done by Faith and Prayer, But neither of 'em was a Lawyer; They of Canary took no Dose, Nor tippl'd Claret at the Rose: They in their Lives were exemplary, Seldom or never did miscarry. We can't in you like Faith believe, Unless you like Example give. Quoth Knight, my Friend, thou'rt very dull, Good God! full fill thy empty Skull. Those Tenents which from Faith arise, To Mortal Men are Mysteries: It is not likely they should know The way translated Men do go; They cannot see the upper Skies, Because they look with dying Eyes; They can no more such Truth unriddle, Than Story of the Bear and Fiddle, Was sung, but broke off in the middle. As for my way of living, wou'd It were as pious Enoch's good. But here, my Friend, you do me banter, For you do know I am no Ranter: Altho for Grace I don't much stickle, And sigh and groan at Conventicle; With little Band am seldom found, Or Locks are circumcised round. Yet tho I do not cant and pray, I am not half so leud as they: And godly Looks do ne'er impart The secret Treasure of the Heart; Which, if it does once entertain Vile Thoughts, Religion is but vain. I in a Band could look as grave As any Conventicle Knave, Cou'd wring my Chaps into Grimaces, And make a hundred godly Faces; Cou'd sit as dull as any Log, And grunt and groan like any Hog. But these are odd sorts of Religions, Contriv'd by Knaves for foolish Wigeons; May be for them a godly Fashion, But are not fitted for Translation. All my Disciples must be airy, And dance as nimble as a Fairy; Must never think of sordid Dying, But practise must the Art of Flying. On a Blush. Written by a Lady. Can my own Blood betray me to Disgrace, Fill me with Shame, then triumph in my Face? Thou base Deserter of my better Part, That hast so long inhabited my Heart, To leave thy dearest native Mansion-Seat Unguarded and expos'd to Love and Fate; Had you but kept the Place, no room had bin For any Damon to have sally'd in: But while in Pomp you in my Cheeks were set, He the Possession of my Heart did get. Now you, my treach'rous Wanderer, may stay, And new Confusion to my Heart convey: You've Bus'ness now of Consequence to tell, But see the gentle Tale you manage well; Appear not you in all your furious Flame, And you may give a Charm as well as Fame. Thou Tell-tale of the Mind, that wilt reveal The very Truth I charge thee to conceal. If secret Joys from Damon's Sight arise, You I suppose will tell it at my Eyes. I could forgive you too, did you proceed From real Cause, or some inglorious Deed: I would be still asham'd of doing ill, And Compensation make by blushing still: But e'en in Innocence you're still my Foe, And what I do not, or I would not know, Still in my Face a seeming Guilt you show. And while it pleases you to take these Airs, I am abandon'd to a thousand Fears. Shame and Confusion dwell upon my Face, While ev'ry one their different Censures pass: Fie Damon! 'twas a treach'rous Coward's part To seize an empty and unguarded Heart. You watch the Sentinel abroad, and then Surprize his Box e'er he come back agen. Come on Lucinda, Trick for Trick say I, Since he's got in, there keep him till he die. There is no Blood you say; then stop it close, Let none return, and I'll engage he goes: For without Blood he can no more live there Than Sparrows in Boyle's Glasses without Air. And if henceforth your Blood should upward move, Say 'tis for Joy and Triumph, not for Love. The Character. Martilla's prudent, wise, discreet, For a Queen's Privy-Council fit; Calm and serene; her Features sweet, Her Judgment strong, and sharp her Wit. Her Breast no ruffled Passion knows, No angry Furrows on her Brows: No pining Envy, servile Fear E'er met with a Reception here. But glorious Virtue fills her Mind, And all that's good in Woman-kind. Masia is lovely, young and fair, Her Aspect charming, mild her Air; Sweet Modesty, that blushing Grace, Reigns triumphant in her Face: She is all Innocence and Love, The Darling of the Gods above. Grippina's courteous, brisk and kind; Her Face declares her easy Mind: She's always gen'rous, bold and true, What's mean she cannot, will not do. Whene'er she sings all silent are, None dare their Tunes with hers compare; The feather'd Songsters of the Air Correct their erring Notes by her. Where three such Nymphs are to be found, Sure it is hallow'd, sacred Ground: And Temples may erected be, For all to worship there with thee. SONG. [The Cestrian Roach will prove a fine Fish] The Cestrian Roach will prove a fine Fish, And Game not in season will make a good Dish For the Court of St. Germains, if serv'd up in state, With forty four Covers of Cornish Church-Plate; And guarded by Scots, that are highly provok'd, With design that a Female of Note may be choak'd. The Sauce takes its Relish from the Hogo of How, And S?r the Coals of the Kitchin will blow. The Grace will be said by nonjuring Ken, And all the High-fliers will soon say Amen. Tofts and Margarita. Musick has learnt the Discords of the State, And Consorts jar with Whig and Tory Hate. Here Devonshire and Somerset attend The British Tofts, and ev'ry Note commend; To native Merit just, and pleas'd to see We've Roman Arts from Roman Bondage free. There fam'd L'Epine does equal Skill imploy, While list'ning Peers croud to th'extatick Joy. B?d to hear her Song his Dice forsakes, And N?m's transported when she shakes: Lull'd Statesmen melt away their drousy Cares Of England's Safety in Italian Airs. Who would not send each Post blank Passes o'er, Rather than keep such Strangers from our Shore? An Address. The attribution of this poem is questionable. Madam, We address you to-day in a very new Fashion, And tell you of nothing but Force and Invasion, Tho some Folks will laugh when they hear the Occasion. Violation's the Word: not a Tittle o'th' Church; For, as Johnny says plainly, you've left us i'th' lurch: The Sham's at an end which made such a pother, And we're plaguily put to our Trumps for another. But since the curs'd Lords have thrown out the Bill, And chose a Committee that piss in a Quill; Who, if we be silent, will find out the Plot, Then N?m's Merit will soon be forgot, And some of us surely must then go to pot: We are forc'd to invent in this dang'rous Crisis, Some pretty new Whims to confound their Devices. Why, Madam, you're ravish'd, your Queenship's invaded, And we must squeel out till of this you're persuaded. But who are the Villains, perhaps you will ask; If we did not tell you, 'twould be a hard Task To guess, or perceive you had any Abuse, So we come on purpose to tell you the News: 'Tis the whole H? of Lords, those damnable Lords, Who have done the sad thing on most of our Words. O, Madam, take care of your Prerogative Royal, We ne'er were before so confoundedly Loyal, For extending your Power to be humbly addressing, And you see we conform on Occasion so pressing; To glut our Revenge, Moderation to foil, The Peers to affront, the State to imbroil. This glorious Quarrel we come to advance, Which is as dear to us as that against France. The Rising Sun: Or, Verses upon the Queen's Birth-Day. Celebrated Apr. 30. M.DC.XC. By John Hamden Esq; Great Soul of Nature, Source of all our Joys, Monarch of th'Universe, whose genial Rays, Of Motion and of Life the only Spring, Entitle Thee, with Justice, to be King Of all that lives, breathes, or moves here below, Since from thy Heat and Light all theirs do flow: How well thou'rt made the Emblem and Device Of that Celestial Nymph, whose glorious Rise Ennobles this blest Day, chasing our Night, Doubling the Glory of thy Sacred Light! How lately we in Darkness were involv'd! Our British World ready to be dissolv'd; Our Laws, our Liberty did gasping lie, And we for Help in vain did sigh and cry: When all our Patriots loudly did proclaim See Burnet's Papers, and others, which were filled with Discourses of the Hopes we had in the Succession of the Princess of Orange. Help and Deliverance from no other Name They could expect than this blest Princess, when She was desir'd by all good English-men, More than the rising of her Planet was By all those Persians, who at once did gaze To see that Sight, which who could first behold Was to be circled in th'Imperial Gold. When we had suffer'd long enough to know The Value of that Good Heav'n would bestow; Within our Hemisphere this Star appear'd, And put an end to all the Ills we fear'd. Preceded by her Morning-Star, and led, (The worthy Partner of her Throne and Bed) Our Glorious Sun on our Horizon rose, Scatter'd all Mists, satisfy'd all, but those Whose Deeds had made them hate the Light, whose Crimes Sought the Confusion of the darkest Times. At first the Blessing seem'd beyond Belief: All wish'd and pray'd for't; few could Credit give. But when we saw Heav'n meant in truth to lend Assistance to us, and by her to send: When she descended on our happy Isle, (A certain Gage of Providence's Smile) When we beheld her mounted on the Throne, Expressing all those Graces which alone In her concentred, set her far before The Heroines so vaunted heretofore: When she and her great Consort did receive The greatest Present mortal Men can give; And at their Feet the Nation's Wisdom laid That Crown, which scarce their Labours fully paid: With what Transports of Joy, upon her Face, We all admiring saw that charming Grace To her peculiar? where her Piety And Modesty plainly appear'd to vie With Love to sinking England, whose Demand Of Help and Succour from her Royal Hand, Determin'd her that vacant Seat to fill, Assigned unto her by Heaven's Will; Pronounc'd by th'best Explainer of God's Choice, And surest Evidence, the People's Voice. Blest Contest! where the Terms, Country and Wife, Strove with her Love to him that gave her Life! And more blest Vict'ry, where Love to Mankind Triumph'd o'er all things in her vertuous Mind! Nor did the Progress any way allay Our Hopes so rais'd by what we saw that Day. The Order introduc'd in every part Where she concern'd her self, the happy Art So little practised in former Reigns, Of making use of all her Courtiers Chains For Cords to draw them to adorn her Court, By all that's vertuous and of good Report, Shew'd us how great a Blessing Heaven intends For those to whom it such a Princess sends. No Scandal, no Offence within her Walls: Under her Care and Conduct all that falls Admits no Blemish, all things are secure Under her vig'lant Eye, and all things pure. Her Virgin's Chastity no Guard requires, Their tender Souls acquainted with no Fires, But with that Ardour which does them inflame To honour their great Mistress, and her Fame Still to advance, teach what by daily Use Such Precepts and Example can produce: Their Wants her bounteous Hand so well supplies, Their Wishes she so fully satisfies; Should Jove from Heav'n come in a Golden Shower, He'd find no Danae within that Bower. Is any Sick, Distressed, Lame, or Poor? Their natural Resort is to her Door. Where Limbs, and Health, and Succour they all find, So like her Saviour's is her pious Mind; So universally she casts her Eyes On all that need her Help; it does suffice, To be in Misery, to have a right To her Protection, and her helping Might. Her Piety looses the Captive's Chains; From offer'd Thanks her Modesty refrains. So affable, so courteous, that her Mouth The Law of Kindness gives. From North to South No Character like hers you'll ever see, Such Sweetness mixt with so much Majesty: To that degree, that Envy's worst Effort Ne'er feign'd in her Faults of another sort, But only this (ridiculous Device!) That she too good, too condescending is. An English Fault, which in her Royal Mind, With English Virtues happily conjoin'd, Such as good Nature, and good Temper are, Do all produce in her a Character So great as, if compared, will pull down All those of other Heads that wear a Crown. Th' Exactness of her Judgment's understood By those whose Fortune makes them have the good To stand before her, and those Accents hear, Those charming Accents, those Decisions clear, Abounding in good Sense, and Judgment sound, When she thinks fit false Notions to confound. But above all, her Piety prevails, That Crown of Virtues, that which never fails, That which will make her happy, when the Law Of frail Mortality shall her withdraw From all our longing Eyes, and shall unite Her precious Substance to that Globe of Light, Which I her Greatness to adumbrate use, Loth to her Merit Justice to refuse. Who ever knew her fail an Exercise Of Piety? Who ever saw her Eyes Wander, or any other Action prove Want of Devotion, or Defect of Love? And yet her greatest Heat of Zeal none saw, Or ever could observe from her to draw Those superstitious Cringes, which such Fools Are wont to use, that Priests have made their Tools. Her Sovereign Judgment shews her how to take The Temper just, what difference to make Between a solid Piety, and that Which Bigots counterfeit, a spurious Brat, Not got 'twixt Heaven and a virtuous Soul, Nor made our vicious Passions to controul; But of base Fear and corrupt Policy, The nauseous Fruit, and Nurse of Tyranny. She knows in such divided Times as these, Like a true Nursing-Mother, how to please Her wrangling Children; and when those did come To bid their long'd-for Princess welcome home, Who in some lesser things dissent from those Our Laws the Pulpits to supply have chose; Far from insulting, or despising such, Who came her Golden Scepter's Top to touch, That under her a Life from Force secure They now might lead, in her Protection sure, To them she stretch'd the evil-charming Rod, And did encourage them to serve their God, And to acquit their Conscience. Then (said she) It is my Wish, and shall my Bus'ness be To end Dissent in Church See her printed Answer to Dr. Bates's Speech, made in the Name and Presence of a great Number of Nonconformist Ministers. (as well as State) And all your bleeding Wounds consolidate. From Cyrus nor from Artaxerxes' Throne More pleasing Oracles the Jews had none. And when her peaceful Lips had thus dispell'd Those venerable Persons Fears, and quell'd Their Apprehensions, she did not disdain To ask their Prayers for her happy Reign. Heaven hear those Prayers, and plentifully shed A Shower of Blessings on her Royal Head, Such as its choicest Fav'rites do partake, And for her own, and her dear Country's sake, Lengthen the Course of her Prosperity; And rather than our Hopes with her should die, Take from our Years to add unto her Days Too happy Victims! Fate above all Praise! Her Virtues Politick come next in view: The Difficulty here's not to say true, But 'tis to say enough. If strong Desire To save her Country from the raging Fire Which had almost devour'd it; if Success Obtain'd by this new Esther's warm Address; If Days consum'd in Prayers, and Nights in Tears, That we might be deliver'd from our Fears; If utmost Hazards run upon the Main, And more than this, if yielding to constrain Her pious Inclinations for our sake, Can on our grateful Hearts th'Impression make Such Actions call for; if her Modesty And Self-denial can but make us see, How she our Peace prefers before her Power, And what new Debts we owe to her each hour, To some degree at least, we may pretend Our matchless Queen's Deserts to comprehend. In the last Century, when this our Land Submitted to a Virgin-Queen's Command, And when our Ancestors by her were sav'd From Popery, and kept from being inslav'd, How did they all conspire to raise her Fame? How dear to after-times will be her Name? And yet to those who estimate things right, To those (I say) whose penetrating Sight Enables them to judg of the Degrees Of Virtue, which accordingly they prize, It will appear our Modern Heroine Beyond Elizabeth as far does shine, As her bright Luminary does outvie The pale-fac'd Cynthia's conquer'd Deity. 'Tis true, she once gave back a Subsidy Unto her People, and so made them see She ask'd their Treasure for no other end, But that with it she might their Rights defend; And when Necessity did not require The Purse-strings should be open'd, her Desire Was rather them her Treasurers to see, Than she the Fleecer of the Flock should be: Richer in their Affections than their Gold, A Heritage not to be bought or sold. This was a great Example, I agree; Elizabeth approv'd her self to be Fit for a Place in that Ring where the Names Of Princes good must eternize their Fames. But when there's Names enow to fill each Place, MARY's the Jewel that the Ring must grace: She, not content a Subsidy to give, For England's Good; that by which she must live, Her whole Subsistence rather chose to lose When the Parliament would have given her a distinct Maintenance, and she declar'd she would have nothing but from the King., Than give pretence to any to suppose An Interest distinct from him whose Star Has blest him by uniting him with her, Or rather than the least pretext afford To the Opposers of their blest Accord. To good Advice Elizabeth gave ear; For Counsellors she singled such as were Friends to the Nation's Int'rest, not for show; But by their help to be directed so, That she might feed the People for their Good, Not Poison ministring instead of Food. She rul'd by Law, nor thought it a Disgrace Our Laws and Reason in a higher place To set, than that Parasites use to give To what they call Royal Prerogative. MARY, not only willing to have Bounds Fixt to that Torrent which all things confounds; Not willing only to be ty'd by Law, And govern so as all our Hearts to draw, Tho crown'd and recogniz'd by full Consent, Tho on her Head the sacred Oil was spent; Altho a Sovereign and a Regnant Queen, Yet this great Princess, that it might be seen How she despis'd her Greatness in compare With those whose Welfare was her chiefest Care, Surpassed Henry's Daughter more alone Than she had pass'd all that before had gone. For she, to manifest what Love she bare Unto the English Nation, and what care She took that Union strict to entertain, Which makes a happy Land, and glorious Reign; And then at once her deep Respect to show To him whom Hymen's Bands had join'd her to, Suspending the Effect of Heaven's Call, Did quite sit by, not governing at all. And tho we all Allegiance to her swore, Our Laws and Coin her Name and Image wore, Love to her Husband, and her Native Land, Made her contented nothing to command. 'Twere easy by this Parallel drove on, To shew how much this Queen has that out-done. And if her dawning Light produce such things, What shall we think her Noon-day Lustre brings? Those that would know what future Times contain, Take a fore-taste of her auspicious Reign, Be told what Conquests she's to make abroad, (Our Christian Semiramis) what Road To Glory's Temple must her Chariot lead, Have nothing else to do but only read What Foreign Bards of this Great Queen do sing See a Magnificent Panegyrick written lately for the King, and sent to him by a Learned Man in Swisserland, named Holtzhalbius, heretofore a Regent in the College at Orange. In this Poem, speaking of the Parliament's presenting the Crown to their present Majesties; he has these Verses, to shew the admiration the World has of the Queen's Virtue, and other great Qualities: Conveniunt Regni Proceres, faustisq; Triumphis Wilhelmi applaudunt Magni, revocantq; MARIAM, E Batavis Sponsam, Regnis tantóq; Marito Dignam quæ reliquas mirandæ lumine formæ, Diviniq; animi præclaris dotibus omnes Præcellit Nymphas, ut stellas Luna minores., Renewing under her th'Eternal Spring Which made the Beauty of the Golden Age, And fills each Poet's Heart-enchanting Page. They shew who shall to her dread Scepter bow, What Laurels flourish on her Sacred Brow, And what a croud of Blessings do attend Those People who upon her Laws depend. But there's no need at all of Foreign Praise The Glory of this Peerless Queen to raise, Did not we see prostrate before her fall Those Subjects of her own who heard the Call Of Heaven from another World, and came To her, that they might abdicate their Name See the Address presented to the Queen at Kensington, by the Deputys of New-England., Henceforth their Country MARYLAND to call, A thing agreed upon by Great and Small? And 'tis no wonder, since that pow'rful Charm Must fill their Country, and their Foes disarm. That Clemency, that Goodness which did shine When she receiv'd their Homage, that divine, That noble Air of Greatness which appear'd, And made her lov'd at once no less than fear'd; Had they still Savages or Rebels been, Would have reduc'd them under such a Queen. Thus her great Deeds, from my Poetick Vein, Lead me to write the Annals of her Reign: But that's a Work must crown with lasting praise The Livys and the Camdens of our Days. This flying Leaf containing, without Art, The Sentiments of a submissive Heart With admiration struck, and Joy to find Such radiant Virtues in a Monarch's Mind, (Where nothing is but naked Fact laid down, By none contested, and to few unknown) Shall end with Wishes, such as flow from Men, Whose fraudless Souls are painted by their Pen. May this bright Day, when Heaven made to this Land The choicest Present of its liberal Hand, Be multiply'd so often, still abound With fresh Successes; may it still be crown'd At home with Palms and Olives, and from Climes Remote with Trophies deck'd so many times, Till thou (Great Queen) thy Ancestors in years Exceed'st as much as does thy Virtue theirs. And when thy Crown, transform'd into a Star, Shall equal shine with Berenice's Hair, May still this lower Orb thy Glory fill, Thy Praises echo from the forked Hill: And may thy Birth an Epoch settled be, By those who write our English History; An Epoch more illustrious than those Of Nabonassar, and of him who chose Hope for his Portion, knew the worth of Praise, Gave all away, only reserv'd the Bays, And Envy bore to Thetis' Valiant Boy More for his Homer than his War with Troy. Thou art a Queen by God and Man design'd: Choice with Succession's in thy Person join'd. The Patriarchal Right and Genarchy With Institution do in thee agree. Thou hast both Law and Nature on thy side, And that by which we most of all are ty'd, Is that we judg thee, by all we have seen, Plato says, there are some, who, by the Excellency of their Endowments, are Kings by Nature. So that a Platonick Prince is one who is worthy to be such. This is a Notion much insisted on by Col. Sidney, in his Answer to Filmer.A Natural and a Platonick Queen. May Heav'n and Men by joint Consent maintain The Product of them both, thy glorious Reign. And since the Will of thy Great Spouse so well Is seconded by both the Houses Zeal, Who now do call thee to exert that Power Which latent in thee did reside before; May all thy Subjects Thee as well obey As he that celebrates this happy Day: May'st thou with such Applause ascend the Throne, So exercise the Government alone; That when again Victorious he shall come From Lands ne'er conquer'd by the Antient Rome, That Diadem he still may brighter find Which does (Great Queen) thy, Sacred Temples bind, And more resplendent far than when the Charms Of Martial Glory drew him from thine Arms. In Silks and Shades let other Queens express Virtues which thou so fully dost possess Mary Queen of Scots, who wrought a Suit of Hangings for a Chamber at Hardwick, where all the Virtues are represented by Symbolical Figures.. Let others shew, by working Beasts and Men, How far the Needle does out-do the Pen Catherine de Medicis, who spent many Years in working some Beds, now in the French King's Garde-meuble.. Let neighb'ring Monarchs pass their precious Hours In viewing Medals, and in planting Flowers. Let them with wild Chimera's fill their Brains, Employ the Poet's and the Painter's Pains, Imaginary Conquests to declare, For forc'd Conversions Monuments to rear; And let their Brain-sick Fancy them persuade Gods are made by Le Brun and La Feuillade. Do thou thy Mind and Thoughts (Princess) apply To rule thy Kingdoms all with Equity (These are thy Arts) of Peace to give the Rule, To spare the Humble, and the Proud controul. And since thy lovely Sex, so full of Charms, Has been to us so happy; in our Arms Planted the Lillies, since it did unite In lasting Bands the Red Rose and the White; May'st thou reconquer Lands, for which the Sword Unto the Distaff could no help afford: New Agincourts and Cressys may'st thou gain, To shew the Salique Law was made in vain. And may'st thou by a nobler Union far Than that which joined York and Lancaster, Fix in thy Subjects Hearts such Harmony, That they again may never disagree. And last of all (to draw unto a Close Upon a Subject which no Limits knows) May this great Festival reserved be For Births of numerous Heroes, which from Thee May spring, in these our Days, to represent The Williams, Maurices, Colignys, sent From Heav'n, oppressed Nations to relieve; Heroes, whose glorious Actions may revive The Brave Plantagenets and Tudors Sage, And the Great Bourbons of our Father's Age: Whose Glory to the highest pitch may rise, The Seas their Empire bound, their Fame the Skies.

      <field name="fulltext">VOL. IV. From 1620. to this present Year 1707. POEMS ON State-Affairs. The Oxfordshire NINE. April 1705. The attribution of this poem is questionable. Perusing the List of the Tackers in Print, And carefully marking what Members were in't, Some Names I observ'd to most Counties did fall: But Oxford afforded no fewer than All. Nine Members, Nine Tackers. And more had there been, And their Number as great as their Spirits were keen: Or had this small County, more fierce than the rest, But sent up as many as some in the West: A desperate Risque we had presently run Of the League being broke, and the Nation undone. Then let us be grateful, and thank Heaven for't, Since their Heads were so hot, that their Hands were so short. But will this agree with their Courtship, thought I, When the Queen was harangu'd, and extol'd to the Sky, In her way to the Bath by the Literate Fry? Or can we imagine it mightily sutes With Thanks for her Gift of the Tenths, and First-fruits? Unless it be grateful in Sons of the Church Their best Benefactors to leave in the Lurch; And when for their sakes she had lessen'd her Store, To shut up the Purse and supply Her no more. For clogging it so as she cannot comply, Is just the same thing as quite to deny. And Tantalus Story again to revive, By giving Her that which She cannot receive. For if a good Bill with another be join'd, It should be with One of a sutable Kind: But to yoak it with what is not proper to pass, Is next to the yoaking an Ox with an Ass; Or to imitate Him, who in Story is said To couple together the Quick and the Dead. Or will it agree with their Blenheim Address, Of Speeches and Verses sent Post from the Press; Out-running poor Cambridg in Loyal Pretence, And before her in Haste, as behind her in Sense? Will not this make their Poetry backward to chime, And turn to Burlesque all Addison's Rhyme? Extolling our Valour, and mighty Success, When they shew by their Tacking they wish it were less: Or commending our Cause, when with the same Breath By stopping our Mony they starve it to Death. Unless they suppose the Nine Muses alone Would ballance the Hurt the Nine Members had done: Or the Queen were so weak as to wink at the Wrong, Forget the Affront, and be pleas'd with a Song. But still I was poring, and sought to Divine What Mystery lay in the Number of Nine: I thought the Nine Muses might serve for the feat, Since there they have chosen their antient Seat. But I found my Mistake e're I went very far: For Tacking tends only to Discord and Jar. The famous Nine Worthies ran next in my Mind; But little Agreement in this I could find: Since nothing less worthy could ever be seen, Than to fetter a Just and a Generous Queen. Nor trust Her with Mony to manage the Sword, But on the condition of breaking her Word. Or what could they offer less Worthy and Brave, Than to hazard a Land they were chosen to save? Or dangerous Tricks, and Experiments try, Exposing us all to the Chance of a Die, And venture at once both the Church and the State, When they saw the French Hannibal stand at the Gate. But still may our Queen twice a Conqueror prove; Of her Foes by her Arms, and her Subjects by Love. The last is the noblest we know of the two; But I fear She will find 'tis the hardest to do. Yet let not Her Majesty wholly despair, Tho bravest Attempts the most difficult are: For as in Eighth Henry our Roses combin'd, And in our First James the two Kingdoms were join'd: Who knows but our ANNE may by Heav'n be decreed To close the wide Wounds of a Nation that bleed? An Union that is of Importance so high: Nor that of our Roses, nor Realms can out-vie. A Victory equal to Blenheim Success; And justly deserving a Triumph no less. And what from Her Reign we must hope for alone: For She by her Sweetness must do it, or None. Let us hope then and pray our next Senate may be As zealous for Peace and Agreement as She: And that our Electors may open their Eyes; And think it no shame at the last to grow wise. Or if some of that List to the House should be sent; Let us pray they may see their Mistake, and repent: And the powerful Charms of her Excellent Reign May sweeten their Tempers, and fetch them again: Until, with a Blush, they reflect on that Vote, As a taking three Kingdoms at once by the Throat: And the only Unkindness that ever was shown To the Kindest of Queens, since She sat on the Throne: And may so regret the Indignity past, That as 'twas the First, so it may be the Last. A Health to the Northamptonshire SNEAKERS, 1705. We'll remember the Men That go with us again, To chuse Knights that can afford, Sir, To serve without Pension, Or other Pretension; And Just and Right is the Word, Sir. As for those that have Pay, We have nothing to say, Let the Soldier live by his Sword, Sir: We're for Them that are known To have Lands of their own; And Just and Right is the Word, Sir. If we chuse their Court-Tools, They may well call us Fools, Tho a Double Saint, and a Lord, Sir: We are sure we can trust Both our Right and our Just; And Just and Right is the Word, Sir. The REPLY. Here's a Health to the Knight Who dares Vote and dares Fight, To maintain our Religion and Laws, Sir, Against France and the Tack, And every mad Jack; And never will Sneak from the Cause, Sir. As for those whom you seem For their Lands to esteem, You little can say of their Brains, Sir: But since nothing can taint Our Brave Soldier and Saint; 'Tis for these Men alone we can answer. Your dull Puns we slight Of your Just and your Right, The Burden of Scoundrel Song, Sir: Cheat us not with a Name, For Your Just Ends in Sham; And your Cart did always go Wrong, Sir. Jure Divino toss'd in a Blanket: OR, Daniel De Foe's Memorial. Unhappy State, condemn'd to worst of Things, Where Lawless Rogues do write, and rail at Kings; All Regal Power with Rebel Notions treat, And lay the Monarch at the People's Feet: Bred from a Factious and Repining Crew, Secur'd by Mercy they would never shew: Of the first Rebel Lucifer's black Stamp, Whom nought will e'er reform but honest Hemp; For meaner Punishments they banter still, And laugh at Vengeance they deserve to feel: Correction's nothing to such Rogues as these, Whom yet the best of Kings could never please: Tho curb'd by the same Power they disown, They'll flatter those their Mischiefs can't dethrone, Where like the Viper, when you Warmth impart, Its Poyson swells and stings you to the Heart: Grown strong in Impudence, in Treason bold; Some useful Tenets they from Scripture hold, Misconstrue Texts, and with malicious Wit, Vary the Glorious Truths of Sacred Writ: Both Right Divine, and Right of Pow'r disown, And raise the People high above the Throne; Heav'n can on Monarchs no such Right bestow, The Gift's the Peoples, and the Power too: That Prince to rule thus has a hopeful Job, Skur'd in a Throne to please a head-strong Mobb A hopeful Doctrine, drawn no doubt from Hell, To teach a stubborn People to Rebel: Which that there may be useful Rogues to prop, Such as De Foe the Devil conjures up; Arm'd with a Pen he sets him on to Wars, To kindle Faction, and Intestine Jars. With double Zeal do's Daniel's Breast endue, Who writes for Bread, and for Sedition too: The Party's Champion—fit for such a Cause, And the most dauntless Rogue that ever was. Tell us then Satan—speak it to his Face, Thou Guardian-Angel of the Rebel-Race, Is there like Daniel one among the Tribes, That half so well the Party's Zeal describes? That better tells us what they've always meant, From Royal Anna's Reign to Martyr'd Charles the Saint. Repining ever, burden'd with Complaints, Wicked as Devils, yet wou'd pass for Saints; A leud, seditious, misbelieving Brood, Perverse, uneasy, obstinate and proud, Revengeful to an infinite Degree, Nurs'd up to Murders and Barbarity, With ev'ry Peal of loud Rebellion chime, (For that's their old Hereditary Crime) A second Nature with their Milk suck'd in, Their free-born Principle and darling Sin; Where seeming Piety, and Meekness grow, Atheists in practice, but mere Saints in show: As tho a formal Cant, and zealous Face, Supply'd all signs of Honesty and Grace; Who for their Int'rest, are the Churchs Friends, And love Devotion as it serves their Ends. These are the Men that would reform the Age, Whose Zeal and Piety lie mask'd in Rage, That down with Superstition cry; Deface Those wicked Organs, and this painted Glass: Down with Church Ornaments, the Pride of Nations, Those worse than Heathenish Abominations; With Sculptures, Surplices, and all the rest, The superficial Trappings of the Beast. When all their formal Cant and Zeal's a Cheat, There's scarce a Saint but is a Hypocrite; Who while they do these strict Injunctions preach, Deny in Actions what their Words do teach. So when Alcides had the Monster slain, He made him dreadful Armour of the Skin. Unhappy Isle—where Faction always reigns, And seems supported in't by Providence; Satyr and Scandal Ammunition are, And Pen and Ink declare a Paper War, Where Scriblers, like our Daniel, fear a Peace, Who draw their whole Subsistence from the Press: Print is their Standard, Publishers their Drums, Feud is the Word, and Pamphlets are their Guns: Where busy Rascals serve as Voluntiers, And help to set the Rabble by the Ears; While Hell and Tumult in the Front appear, And Mischief, and the Devil compose the Rear. On Justice! then such Factious Rogues restrain, And send us Daniel to the Lyons Den. Victory upon Victory: A Poem on the Success of his Grace the Duke of Marlborough over the French Forces near Tirlemont, 1705. Long did Nassau his Belgick Valour try, By English Arms to curb French Tyranny: Vast Sums were given, and great Armies rais'd, And Wonders done, that glorious Prince be prais'd; Whose matchless Conduct all Men must allow, Perform'd strange things, the Lord knows where or how. He cross'd the Seas, where blust'ring Winds arose, And fear'd a Storm as little as his Foes. By force of Arms rang'd Flanders round about, To fight the French, but first to find them out, Which when he'd done, he push'd 'em here and there, And did what lying Fame can best declare. His Actions were profusely Great 'tis true, He bomb'd old Brussels, burnt St. Malloes too, To th'everlasting Mem'ry of the Lord knows who. But Thou Great Marlborough, hast in two Campaigns, Made happy ANN's surpass all other Reigns; And by thy Conduct, at a mod'rate Cost, Retriev'd that Honour fourteen Years had lost. In thy Great Soul, in equal ballance meet, Both Mars's Courage and Apollo's Wit. Thou dost with Temper all thy Actions square, And art too Wise and Fortunate to err. The World's great Tyrant dreads thy pow'rful Hand, As if Jove's Thunder was at thy Command; On thy victorious Deeds looks pale and tame, Envies thy Feats, and startles at thy Name. Matchless and endless is the great Renown, Which thou hast nobly won for England's Crown: Bright Anna's Vertues, joyn'd with thy Success, Shine equal to the Kingdom's Happiness. Domestick Jars are by her Scepter aw'd, Whilst with Her Sword thou Wonders dost abroad. Elizabeth 'tis true was Wise and Great, And rul'd with Prudence a divided State; Did mighty Things, outdone as yet by none, Except good Ann that now ascends the Throne. Elizabeth, to shew her Judgment, chose The gallant Capel to chastize her Foes, Whose valiant Deeds made England's Glory shine: But his (Great Marlborough) ne'er could equal thine; For thou already hast accomplish'd more, Than e're was done by Prince or Peer before. Essex, 'tis true, did wondrous Fame procure, And long in Royal Favour slept secure. But thou art still deservedly more Great, And tow'rst above his Virtues and his Fate. Thy fortunate Success does Faction tame, Maugers their Hopes, and disappoints their Aim; Strikes back the Terror of their threatning Brow, And makes them look confus'd, we know not how. O happy Hero, Wise and Valiant Prince, Darling of Heaven, and the Crown's Defence; The Nation's Bulwark, whose resistless Blows Crush where they fall, and batter down our Foes. The Pride and Glory of the Grand Allies, The Terror of their trembling Enemies; The Head that wisely does project the way To conquer, and the Hand that wins the Day; The trusty Champion of th'Imperial Throne, Firm to their Int'rest, faithful to our own; A Friend to the Hungarian Protestants, Scourge to Bavaria, and a Sting to France; Worship'd by Pagan Hogen as a God, Esteem'd at Home, belov'd and fear'd Abroad. His Glorious Actions fill the World with News, And are the only Themes of ev'ry Muse. With Mirth and Joy he does whole Nations fill, The World seems stagnated when he stands still. Blenheim and Hochstet witness his Success, And this more dang'rous Conquest does no less; But with fresh verdant Lawrels crowns his Head, Such as will out-wear Time, and never fade. Cæsar himself ne'er brought more Honour home, Or brave Fabritius e'er do more for Rome, Than Marlborough has perform'd in all degrees, To England's Glory, and for Europe's Ease. Great Alexander in his youthful Heat, 'Tis true, did all the Eastern World defeat, And many potent Kingdoms over-run; But Marlborough out-does all in conqu'ring one. Horace, Lib III. Ode III. Imitated. The Man that's Resolute and Just, Firm to his Principles and Trust, Nor Hopes, nor Fears can blind; No Passions his Designs controll, Not Love, that Tyrant of the Soul, Can shake his steddy Mind. Not Parties for Revenge engag'd, Nor Threatnings of a Court enrag'd, Nor Storms where Fleets despair; Not Thunder pointed at his Head; The shatter'd World may strike him dead, Not touch his Soul with Fear. From this the Grecian Glory rose, By this the Romans aw'd their Foes, Of this their Poets sing; These were the Paths the Heroes trod, These Arts made Hercules a God, And great Nassau a King. Firm on the rolling Deck he stood, Unmov'd beheld the breaking Flood With black'ning Storms combin'd: Virtue, he cry'd, will force its Way, The Winds may for a while delay, Not alter our Design. The Men whom selfish Hopes inflame, Or Vanity allures to Fame, May be to Fears betray'd; But here a Church for Succour flies, Insulted Law expiring lies, And loudly calls for Aid. Yes, Britans, yes! with ardent Zeal I come, the wounded Heart to heal, The wounding Hand to bind! See, Tools of Arbitrary Sway, And Priests, like Locusts, scour away Before the Western Wind! Law shall again her Force resume; Religion, clear'd from Clouds of Rome, With brighter Rays advance: The British Fleet shall rule the Deep; The British Youth, as rous'd from Sleep, Strike Terror into France. Nor shall these Promises of Fate Be limited to my short Date; When I from Cares withdraw, Still shall the British Scepter stand, Shall flourish in a Female Hand, And to Mankind give Law. She shall Domestick Foes unite, Monarchs beneath her Flags shall fight, Whole Armies drag her Chain; She shall lost Italy restore, Shall make th'Imperial Eagle soar, And give a King to Spain. But, know, These Promises are giv'n, These great Rewards Impartial Heav'n Does on these Terms decree; That, strictly punishing Mens Faults, You let their Consciences and Thoughts Rest absolutely Free. Let no false Politicks confine In narrow Bounds your vast Design, To make Mankind unite; Nor think it a sufficient Cause To punish Men by Penal Laws, For not believing Right. Rome, whose blind Zeal destroys Mankind, Rome's Sons shall your Compassion find, Who ne'er Compassion knew: By Nobler Actions theirs condemn; For what has been reproach'd in them, Can ne'er be prais'd in you. These Subjects suit not with the Lyre; Muse, to what Height dost thou aspire, Pretending to rehearse The Thoughts of Gods, and Godlike Kings? Cease, cease to lessen lofty Things, By mean, ignoble Verse! The Comparison, 1705. That fitting Measures might be taken To save a certain Prince's Bacon, Three Heroes, all true Sons of Mars, As e're look'd Enemy in the A?c, Met lately to concert Affairs. Eug? the Eldest Child of Fame, Who conquers with his very Name, Is once more come to help at a dead Pinch, And means to play the Devil with the French; With M?h known far and near, For Great Atchievements fam'd in War; Who's wisely march'd the Lord knows where, With Troops as good as ever fought, Full fifty thousand Men; He's gone to do the Lord knows what, And will return I don't know when. Ev'n Warlike Lewis, whose Designs Were never yet to hurt his Friends, Who fighting wisely can refrain, And Hunt while German Towns are ta'en. These three, all Men of mighty Deeds, Together wisely laid their Heads, To make a smart Campaign: So the three famous Wits of late Club'd Brains together to compleat, A Fourth as wise Trelooby; And one may wager a good Sum on't, Some mighty Matters soon will come on't, If current Rumour true be. You'll see e'er this Campaign is o'er Deeds worthy to be crackt on; Three Loobies writ a Farce before, Three Gen?ls now will act one. On D. M. 1704. When a Church on a Hill to the Danube advances, Then near to his Ruin the best Cock of France is; Then Three shall beat Five, being anger'd in Spain, And Five on all four run to Paris again; Then the Wit of St. Albans a Princess shall be, In Right of her Husband by the Father of Three. This Prophecy long since was found under-ground By one who was lately in Packington's Pound. On the K. of Sp?'s Present to the D. of M. Accept, my Lord, of this small glittering thing, 'Tis like my self, the shadow of a King; And with it take my Sword, 'tis fit for you; With it I ne'er did ought, nor e'er shall do. Fight for th'Allies, for Honour, and for Me; And when I'm King, you an Arch-Duke shall be. On the Lords and Commons Vote concerning the Danger of the Church, 1705. Thus is at length the horrid Hydra slain, Its many hissing Heads were rear'd in vain; By one Herculean Blow the Monster fell, And with it all the Hopes of France and Hell. Suppos'd to be writ by a Dignify'd Clergyman. When A?a was the Church's Daughter, She acted as her Mother taught her; But now she's Mother to the Church, She leaves her Daughter in the Lurch. A Declaration without Doors, 1705. O ye Britains, draw near, With Attention give Ear To my most profound Declaration: It may do you some good, Tho I'm not understood By twenty wise Men in the Nation. I'm a Parliament Member, Who shall sit in November To settle the Nation's Affairs; Make T? and Laws, Not forgetting a Clause About the High Church's Repairs. The High Church's Power Has to this very Hour, Been of all my Caballing the true end; But I swear by my Maker, If you don't choose me Speaker, The Cause will be certainly ruin'd. I have sent Horse and Man To do all they can, To ingage all your Votes for the Chair: Some Mony I've paid, And more Promises made, Of fine things I'll do when I come there. I was sworn to the Church, Both to People and Porch, And I'm fond of the Name of High-Flyer; I have shewn my good Will For th'Occasional Bill, And to set the whole Nation on Fire. If I get in the Chair, It will quickly appear, Who is for the Church, and who not, Sir: I'll wipe off the Paint Made me look like a Saint, And Moderation shall die on the Spot, Sir. I was chosen for the Nests Of your Highflying Priests, Those dainty young Sons of Apollo; Now my Wit's at a head, I'm appointed to lead, And I'm sure that Sir H? will follow. My Learning t'advance, I travel'd to France, From Paris quite down to Touloon; Where they make People pray The Government's way, And convert them a mode de Dragoon. Before I came home, I travel'd to Rome, And receiv'd th'Infallible Blessing; I ne'er scrupled to bow To the Slipper or Toe, And bestow'd a true Protestant Kissing. I view'd the great Church, And admir'd the Porch, And I counted the Steps to the Altar; I went to the Mattin, Said my Prayers in Latin, And I sung to her Ladyship's Psalter. I bless'd the three Nations With my wise Observations, That they might my Learning inherit; But as soon as 'twas printed, I sincerely repented, 'Twas so laugh'd at I never could bear it. Now from Popery and Rome, I'm to Coventry come, Where I'm quite overrun with Religion; The High Church and I Such Experiments try, You wou'd swear we had Mahomet's Pigeon. The Occasional Bill Was fram'd in our Mill, Of true Catholick Preparation; The Warp and the Woof Look'd like Protestant Stuff, But the Devil was in the Fashion. I huzza'd for the Tack, For I was always a Jack, And was fond of Jure Divino; But with what Intent, Or what 'twas I meant, That's a thing neither you know nor I know. To High-Church I'm as true, As a Protestant blue, And fain wou'd Dissenters be Mobbing; But we had such a Defeat In Coventry Street, That we're damnably 'fraid of their drubbing. I hate Moderation, It has ruin'd the Nation, Both the B?s and Q? are infected; Do but set me i'th' Chair, I'll the High-Church repair, And Religion shall soon be dissected. We have made such Advances, You'd think them Romances, All the Churches on Earth to unite-a; That Mahomet and We May quickly agree, And Rome shall no more men affright-a. Our true English Church Shall to Popery approach, And Popery to her shall advance; The Sisters shall kiss, Pass by what's amiss, And we shall shake hands, Sir, with France. Thus the Tools of the Age Shall quickly grow Sage, When they cant of their Union and Peace, Sir; This will Union convey The true Catholick way, And the World shall be all of a Piece, Sir. If the Whigs and Dissenters Should think to prevent us, And oppose us with damn'd Moderation; By unanimous Votes, We will cut all their Throats, And so we'll unite the whole Nation. On the Duke of B?'s House. Sic siti lætantur Lares. Happily hous'd these Lares are, To feed on Vista's and fresh Air, To dine with Humphrey's Duke each day, And gaze their Supper-time away. Wou'd Ceres bring her His Coat of Arms is the Wheat-Sheaf. Sheafs of Corn, 'Twou'd better Sheffield's House adorn; To which if Bacchus Grapes wou'd bring, Then might the Lares laugh and sing. The doleful Complaint of Sir H. M. on the Loss of his Election at Oxford, 1705. Ye Freeholders most dear Of Cardigan-shire, Look down from your Mountains with Pity, On the desperate Case Of your Knight Out of Place, And attend to my sorrowful Ditty. I left you indeed, In hopes to succeed At Oxford, the Seat of the Muses; Where Merit prevails At less Cost than in Wales, And the Chosen adorn him that chooses. The Thing would be done As sure as a Gun, I was told by Sachev'rell my Hector; But now they send back Poor baffled Sir Mac, And call me an empty Projector. A Pinnacle Fine, Dug out of my Mine, I rais'd on the Top of High Church-a; To no Purpose, God wot, They matter it not, And leave me and my Cause in the Lurch-a. I sent to each Head, Bound in Blue and in Red, My Case of Ashby and White-a; But as soon as they'd read it, I lost all my Credit, And now they bid me go sh???te-a. I drew my Goose Quill For Occasional Bill, And wore it quite down to the Stump-a; I gave them my Pelf, Would ha' given 'em my self, But they care not a F?t for Sir Numph-a. I wrote o'er and o'er All the Bills for the Poor, And abridg'd them to one that was longer; Touch'd again and again By my accurate Pen, Each Clause grew stronger and stronger. All my Labour and Law Was not thought worth a Straw, To reward Publick Spirits no Care is; First my Bill with a Flout, Then I was thrown out, And sent back with the Poor to the Parish. A Book I put out, I wrote it about The Thoughts of a Man of Black-List-a; But the Stuff that came after, Occasion'd such Laughter, My Readers were almost bepist-a. The Learned allow'd, Of which I am proud, That the Work there had been some Good in; But still they would say, 'Twas all out of the way, And had not one word of the Pudding. When the Poll was declar'd, O then it appear'd, At which I was too much concern'd; That Sir William had more By One Hundred and Four, Than even Sir Humphrey the Learned. Had the Odds been but few, I had ne'er look'd so blue, Since Regard had been paid to my Merit; To be beat out of Sight By an Un-Writing Knight, Flesh and Blood is not able to bear it. Since they've play'd such a Game, Let them e'en take the Shame, They shall find to their Cost what will follow; I'll retire to my Mines, Where the Sun never shines, And a F?t for the Sons of Apollo. An ODE on the D. of Marlborough, 1706. What Pow'r of Words can equal thy Renown, Illustrious God of War? What Muse can raise Numbers sufficient for thy Praise? Thalia, Arethusa, skill'd in Song, The mighty Task decline; To Churchill's Race the Theme belongs, (Churchill's Race transcend the Nine.) 'Tis The Duke of Marlborough's Daughter married to the Earl of Sunderland. Sunderland alone that must inspire, She shares the Godlike Hero's Fire; And she must tune the Voice, and animate the Lyre. O Marlbro', her Influence shall supply The Poet's mean Ability; Whilst he to sing prepares The Triumphs of thy Wars; The Terror of thy conq'ring Arms, Which freed the Empire from Alarms, And struck the trembling Gaul with pannic Fears. Lewis, once call'd The Great, In Thee beholds his Fate; At Schellemberg thou let'st him see An Action worthy of thy Cause and Thee: On Blenheim's fatal Plain, Thousands on Thousands slain, Told the insulting Foe again, That Marlborough, arm'd in ANNA's Cause, To injur'd Nations should restore Their Rights, their Liberties and Laws. Forsaken Justice shall no longer mourn, Uninterrupted Streams of Faith return, Now Marlbro's thund'ring Arm has broke the Tyrant's Pow'r. What Pyramids of Praise! What Wreaths of never-dying Bays Shall crown thy Glorious Head? Who to sure Conquest dost thy Armies lead. The Passage of the Granic Flood, Which has so many Ages stood, Renown'd in Grecian Story, With all young Ammon's Deeds, are but a Foil To the Superior Action of the Dyle, And only serve to raise the Lustre of thy Glory. The Heroes of Antiquity, Great Pompey, Cæsar, Anthony, and He Who Kindred claim with Jove, Shall blush to see Themselves fall short, so infinitely short of Thee. And Oh! Thou eldest Son of Fame! How shall we 'nough adore thy Name? To praise thee as we ought, The Spirit of our Lays Should equal that with which our Hero fought, And gain'd immortal Fame at Rammelies. But Numbers are too slow, So fast thy mighty Conquests flow; Such is the Terror of thy Sword, So quick the yielding Cities Bow, To recognize their rightful Lord. Joyful Iberia shall declare The Wonders thou hast done for her; Admiring Europe shall confess, To thee they owe the Charms of Peace, And Nations emulous shall crown thy vast Success. Thrice happy Britain! glorious Isle! On Thee the rescu'd Princes smile, And bless thy fruitful Plains, From whence their great Deliv'rer came; Where Marlbro' drew his vital Flame, And mighty ANNA reigns. But Oh! amidst th'extreamest Joy Of thy exulting Swains, How are thy Bards deprest! What dire Confusion fills their Breast! When anxious they behold The British General, with greater Ease, Vanquish the Nation's Enemies, Than they find Words to celebrate his Victories. The Seven Wise Men. Seven Sages in these latter Times are seen, The Glory and Support of Albion's Queen; Whose Wisdom will the Gordian Knot undo, And be our Isle's Palladium 'gainst the Foe. Unstable Britain may like Dilos float, Yet still she's safe while Patriots guide the Boat. First stands recorded, in the List of Fame, The gen'rous, brave, the humble S?'s Name; Learning's good Ornament, the Muses Pride, By Nature form'd in Councils to preside. The Poets, who in Crouds his Table throng, Are ravish'd with the Accents of his Tongue; The rhiming Guests are fed with sumptuous Fare, Rewards can make his gibb'rish Language clear. A gentle D? comes next in close Debate, To search into the deep Intrigues of State; But scarce had he in Council taken place, When fond Lucinda call'd away his Grace; In Liberties of Love, she told her Lord, His Talent was not for the Council-board. Her tender Limberham she did implore To quit those factious Follies at Threescore; And pleaded that his Name was only given To have one Man of Honour in the Seven. Next giddy Phaethon begins his Flight, And boldly dares ascend the Orb of Light; But the rash Youth will soon inflame the Ball, And with Confusion from his Chariot fall. Those Jackdaws Eyes can never bear the Test, Tho they were nourish'd in an Eagle's Nest; Those artless Hands, and that untimely Zeal, May harm, but ne'er preserve the Commonweal: Then to his Library let him confine The undigested Notions of his Brain; In curious Speculation spend his Days, And labour to preserve J?s F?rb?s's Praise. To Learning, 'tis confess'd, he'as some Pretence, For he abounds in Books, tho not in Sense. O valiant Sc?! with unan'mous Voice, The Nation does applaud the Senate's Choice; Grown old in Wars, thou must in Council sit, For Councils now, as once for Actions, fit. Thy penetrating Sense can soon unfold Mysterious Truth in thy own Cyphers told. As a raw Youth, of the Patrician Race, In that August Assembly claims a Place, Only with awful Silence to attend, And by the Sire's wise Precepts form his tender Mind, Our modern Sages prudently admit Young T?s?d should in the Committee sit; Provided still the first like Stamp he bear, And, like the Infant Carthaginian, swear Immortal Hatred to his Father's Foes, And ever to support The Good Old Cause. Unheard came creeping next a crafty Bard, Who factious Business never did retard; An antient Stock, in covert Sawpits bold, In Plots consummate, and in Tricks grown old; Since among Knaves he holds the foremost place, Old Fer?n's Footsteps who so well can trace? Tho twice his Marriage-bed has been betray'd, Good reason still his Vengeance has allay'd. The Injury his former Spouse has done, A large Estate most amply did atone; He is content his present Spouse should strole To gain young Bullies to the Kit-kat Bowl. S?, thou mighty Genius, next arise, Nor let young J?es thy Vigilance surprize; Let neither Guilt, or Crime, nor sense of Pain Distract the Projects of thy teeming Brain, Those Labours may be crown'd another Reign. With thy accustom'd Art expound the Laws, Weighing the Party's Merit, not the Cause. Above the common Honour of a P?, Thy restless Soul disdains that humble Sphere. A Blazing-Comet to amaze the Sight, And with a fiery Tail the People fright. Thus, for a while, thou may'st with Lustre shine, But soon to Primitive Dregs thou must return again. Oh Albion, on these Shoulders ne'er repose, These are thy dangerous intestine Foes; These are the Tyrants who would thee enthral, Resolve to govern, or o'erthrow the Ball, Tho they, like Sampson, in the Ruin fall. An Allusion to the Bishop of Cambray's Supplement of Homer, 1706. Cambray, whilst of Seraphick Love you set The noblest Image in the clearest Light; A Love by no Self-Interest debas'd, But on th'Almighty's high Perfections plac'd; A Love in which true Piety consists, That soars to Heav'n without the help of Priests: Let partial Rome the great Attempt oppose, Support the Cheats from which her Income flows. Her Censures may condemn, but not confute, If best your elevated Notions suit With what to Reason seems th'Almighty's Due, They have th'Appearances of being true: And what can animated Clay produce Beyond a Guess, in Matters so abstruse? But when, descending from Empireal Height, You stoop of sublunary Things to treat, Minerva seems your Moral to dispense; How great the Subject, how sublime the Sense! Not the Meonian Bard with such a Flame E'er sung of ruling Arts (your lofty Theme) In your Telemachus (his Hero's Son) We see the great Original outdone. There is in Virtue sure a hidden Charm To force Esteem, and Envy to disarm; Else in a flatt'ring Court you ne'er had been design'd T'instruct the future Troublers of Mankind. Happy your Native Soil (at least by Nature so) On none her Treasures more profusely flow. The Hills adorn'd with Vines, with Flow'rs the Plain, Without the Sun's too near Approach, serene. But Heav'n in vain does on your Vineyards smile, The Monarch's Glory mocks the Lab'rer's Toil; Whilst to set up Pretenders to the Throne Of other Kingdoms, he destroys his own. Neglected Ceres with Reluctance yields Her Tribute to uncultivated Fields. What tho elab'rate Brass with Nature strive, And proud Equestrian Figures seem alive? With various Terrors on their Basis wrought, With yielding Cittadels surpriz'd or bought? Such Prodigies of Art and costly Pains, Serve but to gild th'unthinking Rabbles Chains. O despicable State of all that groan Under a blind Dependency on One! How far inferior to the Herds that range With Native Freedom o'er the Woods and Plains: With them no Fallacies of Schools prevail, Nor of a Right Divine the nauseous Tale, Can give to one among themselves a Pow'r, Without Controul his Fellows to devour. To reas'ning Humankind alone belong The Arts to hurt themselves, by reas'ning wrong. Howe'er the foolish Notion first began, Of trusting abs'lute Pow'r to lawless Man; Howe'er a Tyrant may by Force subsist, (For who would be a Slave that can resist?) Those sit the safest, easiest on the Throne, That make their Peoples Interest their own; And chusing rather to be lov'd than fear'd, Are Kings of Men, not of a Servile Herd. Oh Liberty! wish'd for too late, when lost; Like Health, by those that want thee, valu'd most. In Regions, where no Property is known, Thro which the Garonne runs, and rapid Rhone, Where Peasants toil for Harvests not their own, How gladly would they quit their fruitful Soil, How gladly change for thee their Wine and Oil! As Wretches chain'd and lab'ring at the Oar, In sight of Italy's delightful Shore, Reflect on their unhappy Fate the more. Thy Laws have still their Force above the rest Of Gothic Kingdoms; happy Albion, blest: Long since their antient Freedom they have lost, And servilely of their Subjection boast. Thy better Fate the vain Attempt resists Of faithless Monarchs, and designing Priests; Unshaken yet thy Government subsists. While Streams of Blood the Continent o'erflow, Red'ning the Maese, the Danube, and the Po; Thy Thames, auspicious Isle, her Thunder sends To crush thy Foes, and to relieve thy Friends. Say Muse (since no Surprize, or foreign Stroke Can hurt her guarded by her Walls of Oak, Since wholesom Laws her Liberty transfer To future Ages) what can Albion fear? Can she the dear-bought Treasure throw away? Have Universities so great a Sway? The Muse is silent, cautious to reflect On Mansions where the Muses keep their Seat. Barren of Thought, and niggardly of Rhime, My creeping Numbers she forbids to climb; Vent'ring too far, my weary Genius fails, And o'er my drooping Senses Sleep prevails. An Antique Pile near Thames's Silver Stream Was the fantastick Object of my Dream; In antient time a consecrated Fane, But since apply'd to Uses more profane: Fill'd with a popular debating Throng, Oft in the Right, and oftner in the Wrong: Of Good and Bad the variable Test, Where the Religion that is voted best Is still inclin'd to persecute the rest. On the high Fabrick stood a Monster fell, Of hideous Hue, second to none in Hell; No Fury to be more abhor'd and fear'd, Her Teeth and Jaws with Clods of Gore besmear'd; Her Party-colour'd Robe obscenely stain'd With pious Murders, Freemen rackt and chain'd; With the implacable and brutal Rage Of fierce Dragoons, sparing nor Sex, nor Age; With all the horrid Instruments of Death Torturing the Innocent, to improve their Faith, Piercing the Roof with her infectious Breath, Thus She began; Are then my Labours vain, That to the Pow'r of France have added Spain? Vain my Attempts to make that Empire great? And shall a Woman my Designs defeat? Baffle th'infernal Project I've begun, And break the Measures of my fav'rite Son? How diff'ring from the Heroes of her Race, Who made their Humour of their Laws take place; And, slighting Coronation-Oaths, disdain'd Their high Prerogative should be restrain'd. Tho her own Isle is bless'd with Liberty, Has she a Right to set all Europe free? Under this Roof, with Management, I may The Progress of her Arms at least delay. From a contagious Vapour I will blow Within these Walls, Breaches shall wider grow; Here let imaginary Fears prevail, And give a Colour to affected Zeal; From trivial Bills let warm Debates arise, Foment Sedition, and retard Supplies. If once my treach'rous Arts and watchful Care Break the Confed'racy, and end the War, Ador'd in Hell I may in Triumph sit, And Europe to one Potentate submit. Waking at so destable a Sound, I cry'd, Infernal Hag, be ever dumb! Here Anna reigns; a Queen by Heav'n bestow'd To right the Injur'd, and subdue the Proud. As Rome of old gave Liberty to Greece, Anna th'invaded sinking Empire frees: Th'Allies her Faith, her Pow'r the French proclaim, Her Piety th'Oppress'd, the World her Fame. At ANNA's Name, dejected, pale and scar'd, The execrable Fantom disappear'd. An Elegy on the burning of the Church Memorial, 1705. No! Sacred Pages, never more repine, Tho sacrific'd to Faction and Design. Thy Votaries by this more strong become, Gath'ring fresh Vigor from your Martyrdom. Arabian Spices so, dissolv'd by Heat, Scatter Perfumes around, divinely sweet: So thy Professors fell in wicked Days, Their Glorious Lives concluding with a Blaze. By such a Death would I obtain a Name, And make my Zeal outshine my Fun'ral Flame. So from the World the Cæsars did retire, Ascending to the Gods from Piles of Fire. So Ptolomy's fam'd Library did shine In Unlearn'd Flames; No Loss compar'd to thine. But we can you, Immortal Leaves, restore To former Life; nor the hard Fate deplore. Sure from your Smoak some Miracle must rise, As when an Angel mounted to the Skies, And sanctify'd the Flame in Manoah's Sacrifice: Spite of thy adverse chance, thou shalt be read, Nor dye, till Principle and Truth be dead. Thou to thy Beauty shalt again return, Smile like a Cherub, like a Seraph burn. But Oh! Expect what the three Children bore, A Fire that's Seven times hotter than before, And all Fanatick Rage can practise more. Yet thou shalt feel no Harm, no Fear disclose, But like the Furnace, flash upon thy Foes. Fire and Faggot, or the City Bon-Fire. She's dead! thanks to the Jury's pious Care, And all her sad Complaints are turn'd to Air; Vanish'd in Smoak, as her neglected Crys From Earth to Hav'n's more pitying Mansions rise. O G?ll?nd Mr. Gellibrand, who sollicited to get this Libel burnt., to thy fam'd Zeal is due, That Salter's Hall has glorious things in view, That Pinner's and Old-Jury's younger Paul's Hold Saints triumphant now within their Walls; Since but for Thee, as sure as God's in Gloc'ster, The Court had never fix'd on ways to roast her. Th'Attempt was noble, as the Fact was bold, Let it in Gath and Askalon be told, That Unbelievers may from thence perceive, We dare to punish such as dare to grieve; Heav'ns bless the righteous B? each Mother's Son, Who have their Sage Fore-fathers Deeds outdone, And thus disclaim'd the Sins of Forty One: They ne'er sat bogling how to judg and try her, But flung her instantly into the Fire: So perish all, that from these Presents dare Speak what's offensive to the City Chair, Or vent such Doctrines as shall disagree With bless'd Occasional Conformity. Not that to Thee alone we should ascribe That Ephraim gains the point of Judah's Tribe, And rides upon the Shoulders of his Foe, As High Church yields the Day to what is Low. Others have been Partakers in the Deed, Witness brave D?n, D?le, H?g?s, Th? Immortal D?nes, Hugh H?dy, M?x?y, L?n, Who could not bear to see Dissenters undone; With Gl?r, H?r?s, Saint-like H?ch and H?s, Heroes of Worth, and of just claim to Praise, B?d?n, Gr?y, Sw?ne, Fr?h and L?k, Seventeen good Men, and true as ever struck, As ever took up Arms in days of Yore, Or e'er drew Basket-Hilt at Marston Moor. Sculpture, in Monumental Brass erect Those that have made the Saints the True Elect; Their Statues in the several Niches range, Fix'd upon Pedestals before th'Exchange. Patriots like these the Fabrick will adorn, And stimulate the Children yet unborn; To make the coming Ages be their own, And practise the Examples they have shown. What if the Court no Precedent can plead, And they from customary Rules recede, As they beyond past Ages Foot-steps run, And act what by the Senate's only done? Must querimonious Mutineers imply Culprit was wrong'd, and did not fairly die? The Thought's absurd, and foolish the Mistake; Where Precedents are wanting we should make. Some would have had her all besmear'd with Tar, And carry'd into Smithfield from the Bar, Where Saints of old eternal Truths confess'd, Mounting from earthly Flames to Heav'nly Rest. But wiser Heads, who soon foresaw a Tartar, Judg'd she from thence might have been stil'd a Martyr, And sent her to th'Exehange, to make her sad Departure. Since no one there cou'd be suppos'd to die Or for Religion, or for Loyalty, Virtues unknown (their Practices a shame on) To such whose Idol's Gain, and God is Mammon. And there, to expiate her vile Offence, On the bright Wings of Flame she mounted hence; Soar'd upward, where departed Spirits rise, And climb'd the vast Expanse, and reach'd the Skies. Thus Hercules (as Heathen Poets feign) On Oeta's Top, like this Delinquent slain, High o'er the Stars, Celestial Regions trod, By being made a Mortal, made a God. Mully of Mountown. A Poem. By the Author of the Tale of a Tub. I. Mountown! Thou sweet Retreat from Dublin Cares, Be famous for thy Apples and thy Pears, For Turnips, Carrots, Lettice, Beans, and Pease, For Peggy's Butter, and for Peggy's Cheese. May Clouds of Pigeons round about thee fly, But condescend sometimes to make a Pye. May fat Geese gaggle with melodious Voice, And ne'er want Gooseberries or Apple-Sauce. Ducks in thy Ponds, and Chickens in thy Penns; And be thy Turkeys Numerous as thy Hens. May thy Black Pigs lye warm in little Stye, And have no Thought to grieve them till they die. Mountown! The Muses most delicious Theam, O may thy Codlins ever swim in Cream! Thy Rasb? and Strawberries in Bourdeaux drown, To add a redder Tincture to thy own; Thy White-Wine, Sugar, Milk together club, To make that gentle Viand Syllabub. Thy Tarts to Tarts, Cheesecakes to Cheesecakes join, To spoil the Relish of the flowing Wine: But to the fading Palate bring Relief By thy Westphalian Ham, or Belgick Beef. And to compleat thy Blessings in a Word, May still thy Soil be Generous as its Lord. II. Oh Peggy, Peggy, when thou go'st to brew, Consider well what you 're about to do; Be very Wise, very sedately think That what you are about to make is Drink: Consider who must drink that Drink, and then What 'tis to have the Praise of Honest Men: For surely, Peggy, while that Drink does last, 'Tis Peggy will be toasted or disgrac'd. Then if thy Ale in Glass thou would'st confine, To make its sparkling Rays in Beauty shine, Let thy clean Bottle be entirely dry, Lest a white Substance to the Surface fly, And, floating there, disturb the curious Eye. But this great Maxim must be understood, Be sure, nay very sure, thy Cork be Good; Then future Ages shall of Peggy tell, That Nymph that brew'd and bottl'd Ale so well. III. How fleet is Air! How many things have Breath, Which in a moment they resign to Death; Depriv'd of Light, and all their happiest State, Not by their Fault, but some o'er-ruling Fate! Altho fair Flowers, that justly might invite, Are cropt, nay torn away for Man's Delight; Yet still those Flowers, alas, can make no Moan, Nor has Narcissus now a Power to groan. But all those things which breathe in different Frame, By Tye of common Breath Man's Pity claim. A Gentle Lamb has Rhetorick to plead, And when she sees the Butcher's Knife decreed, Her Voice entreats him not to make her bleed; But cruel Gains, and Luxury of Taste, With Pride, still lays Man's Fellow Mortals waste: What Earth and Waters breed, or Air inspires, Man for his Palate sits by torturing Fires. Mully, a Cow sprung from a Beauteous Race, With spreading Front did Mountown's Pastures grace. Gentle she was, and with a gentle Stream, Each Morn and Night gave Milk that equal'd Cream. Offending None, of None she stood in Dread, Much less of Persons which she daily fed: But Innocence cannot it self defend 'Gainst Treacherous Arts vail'd with the Name of Friend. Robin of Derbyshire, whose Temper shocks The Constitution of his Native Rocks, Born in a The Devil's Arse of Peak. Place, which if it once be nam'd, Wou'd make a Blushing Modesty asham'd: He with Indulgence kindly did appear, To make poor Mully his peculiar Care. But inwardly this sullen churlish Thief Had all his Mind plac'd upon Mully's Beef: His Fancy fed on her, and thus he'd cry, Mully, as sure as I'm alive you die; 'Tis a brave Cow, O Sirs when Christmas comes, These Shins shall make the Porridge grac'd with Plumbs. Then midst our Cups, while we profusely Dine, This Blade shall enter deep in Mully's Chine: What Ribs, what Rumps, what Bak'd, Boil'd, Stew'd, and Roast? There shan't a single Tripe of her be lost. When Peggy, Nymph of Mountown, heard these Sounds, She griev'd to hear of Mully's future Wounds: What Crime, says she, has gentle Mully done? Witness the Rising and the Setting Sun, That knows what Milk she constantly would give; Let that quench Robin's Rage, and Mully live. Daniel, a Sprightly Swain, that us'd to slash The vigorous Steeds that drew his Lord's Calash, To Peggy's side inclin'd; for 'twas well known How well he lov'd those Cattle of his own. Then Terence spoke oraculous and sly, He'd neither grant the Question, or deny; Pleading for Milk, his Thoughts were on Mince-Pye. But all his Arguments so dubious were, That Mully thence had neither Hopes nor Fear. You've spoke, says Robin, but now let me tell ye 'Tis not fair-spoken Words that fill the Belly; Pudding and Beef I love, and cannot stoop To recommend your Bonny-Clapper Soop; You say she's innocent, but what of that? 'Tis more than Crime sufficient that she's Fat; And that which is prevailing in this Case, Is, there's another Cow to fill her Place. And granting Mully to have Milk in store, Yet still this other Cow will give us more; She dies—stop here my Muse, forbear the rest, And vail that Grief which cannot be exprest. A Letter to Mareschal Tallard. Made English out of French. By J. Br. 1705. It's true, Tallard, when fickle Chance deny'd, At Blenheim's fatal Field to crown thy Side, Where Right again did win; and Europe see Thy Master's Lillies droop, tho led by Thee: It might be well allow'd thee to repine, For who's a Stoick, in a Case like thine? But now since others striving to repair Thy Country's Loss, with as successless Care, Ha' found superior Britain's Strength the same, O'erthrown like Thee in the mad Chace of Fame; Forgive th'unsteddy Goddess thy Defeat, And count it Churchill's Privilege to beat. In Ages past, the mighty Mortal name, That could an equal Place in Annals claim; The Boasts and Wonders of the Trojan Race, From Rome's aspiring Twins, to Cæsar, trace; Thro the long Roll of all their Labours run, Till ev'ry Town subdu'd, and Battel won. But as thou dost the glorious Search pursue, And leaving antient Valour, turn to New; Be just to Churchill's Worth, and thy best Praise bestow, A noble Spirit's Gift, on such a matchless Foe. For see assisting Fate, with Force Divine, Once more for him the doubtful Scale incline; See Flanders now a bloody Prospect yield, And Blenheim rival'd by Ramillia's Field. Where met alike, and by as daring Men, The Warrior has out-stript his Country's Hopes again. Observe how soon usurpt Dominion fell, While juster Titles were asserted well; How to reduce the long contested Soil Of Belgia's better half, was but a Se'nnights Toil. Then own, Tallard, tho there but little be Of Truth allow'd in Tales of Chivalry; Tho where great Acts are pictur'd in Extremes, We think 'em oft'nest but the Writer's Dreams. Some Prodigies authentick we may call, And all that's strange, is not Apocryphal. When Spierbach's Fortune, to thy Valour kind, Did thy serener Brow with Laurels bind; When thou bought'st Conquest at a rate too high, Since thy Defeat, which paid it, was so nigh; Thy Soul could surely, with Applauses warm, No Thought of her approaching Sorrow form; Nor while on Seas so smooth thy Fate did steer, Imagine Shelves and Quicksands would appear. That double Trophy on his Borders got, Old hoary Rhine yet cannot ha' forgot; When he a Witness of the Germans Grief, From his deep Channel saw Landau's Relief: The false Assurance of Eternal Praise, Thy Lewis then infer'd from one well-gotten Bays; For tho he thought Confederate Force to break, The Boyan Duke, and Marsin were too weak; He doubted not but those combin'd with you, Would on the Danube turn the Ballance too. 'Twas then (O Flattery of Bourbon's Fate!) The Race of Cæsar's, in its threatned State, Beginning first of Succour to despair, The Shock of three such Torrents scarce could bear. In vain the Swords of Lewis and Eugene, So oft in Turkish Fields successful seen, (Where never drawn without expected Gain, The waxing Moons they still compell'd to wain.) Your Rage oppos'd, while the big Tide was high; To stem it quite another Arm must fly. The bold Physician of an Empire's Fears, For this great Task reserv'd, at last appears: It's succ'ring Churchill, who with Justice great, No Blank e'er draws among the Lots of Fate; As if but He to fix the Goddess knew, And Laurels only for his Temples grew: Hard was the Warrior's March, and long the Way, Till Schellemberg he reacht, his first Essay, Where Europe did on both thy Rivals see The Blush of a Defeat unshar'd by thee. 'Twas a brave Effort! but one more as great The Hero wants to make the Gain compleat: Two Chiefs ha' fled, but till the Third be fought, His Sum of Trophies is imperfect thought. And now, Tallard, what kind Oblivion, say, Can rase the Journal out of that unhappy Day? When, one lost Battle eager to retrieve, Thou didst a second's Gain secure believe: Too sure 'twas Malice of thy veering Fate, And Glory never laid a falser Bait! A smaller Force, it's true, did thine oppose, But such a Leader made the Odds thy Foes; Nor could, the profer'd Fight, thy feebler Side Accept with Safety, tho it might with Pride. With how much Blood the Field was crimson'd here, My Muse forbears to grate a Captive's Ear; What Thousands perisht in the Danube Stream, By full as many sung, is grown too stale a Theme. On Thee alone my wond'ring Thought's intent, Thy Fortune to my Eyes that Day present. Methinks I hear from thy unwilling Tongue That abject Word at last of Quarter wrung; And see thy utmost need extort the Sound, Which gives thy drooping Soul its deepest Wound. Their Liberty, with thee to Life inclin'd, A hundred valiant Chiefs besides resign'd: Submission, mean in any other Place, Where such a Hero wins, does lessen the Disgrace, But urg'd by Danger, and by Safety led, O Shame to all his Wreaths! Bavaria fled! Too happy! had he been like thee confin'd, And not reserv'd for a worse Fate behind. 'Twas Comfort yet to see thy Conduct since, Nor censur'd by thy Friends, nor punisht by thy Prince. What tho with Spite to thy Undoing us'd, A Chief too rash, some Enemies accus'd; A gentle Master soon their Malice crost, And with a Province paid a Battle lost. Let next my Muse, thy Victor's Mercy boast, And strive herself to pay the Debt thou ow'st For such a Triumph: When he made thee bend, Did one insulting Word thy Ears offend? Say, Did not he (tho Captives may allow Some Arrogance in those who make 'em bow) Kind to thy Grief, yet faithful to his Charge, Of Conqueror, and Friend, the Parts discharge? For since the Chance of that abandon'd Field, Which saw thee, destitute of Succour, yield, From Britain's Queen, to moderate thy Pain, A gentle Prison his Request did gain: O pleasing Change! which sends thee kindly o'er From Danube's hated Banks to Trent's delightful Shore. It's there thou dwell'st, and with no Cloud between, Hast two revolving Suns already seen; Of so much Ease, and Liberty possest, Thy Embassy it self scarce shew'd thee half so blest. Not so the Boyan Duke; his Planets still, O just Reward for broken Faith! are ill; His State subverted, and his Titles lost, He finds too late the Price his Treasons cost. To try the Fortune of another Plain, It's true, he picks his Fugitives again; Dares a third time his Victor's Fury meet, And (what could else be thought) does feel a third Defeat. Thy Monarch, eager of a Battel's Gain, His Villeroy and Marsin sends in vain; Confus'd they run, as scar'd by Magick Charms, And catch contagious Ruin from his Arms. Now take a View (if where thou art confin'd, Thy Master's Fate employs thy anxious Mind) Of his abortive Schemes, and then confess, Since laid unjustly they could be no less: To win the Nations he did once perplex, And to his own surrounding Crowns annex; (Howe'er thy King expected to prevail) Was such a Task, he could not chuse but fail: For tho Great William's Arms (ordain'd by Fate To buttress up the first declining State) Successless often did in Fields engage, And stopt ('twas all it could) but half his Rage; Yet see (strange Female Force) Imperial ANNE Compleats the Work unfinisht by the Man. O durst some Minister, in Council near, But speak a famous Truth in Bourbon's Ear! And, one fit Moment, artfully relate The Scythian Queen's Success, and Persian Founder's Fate; The Moral well apply'd, might make him see A Woman's Arm had quel'd a greater King than he. That thus she triumphs, while the World forgets The Tudor's Glory, and Plantagenet's. While lessen'd every new victorious Year, Her hundred Great Forefathers Acts appear. To valiant Hands, Tallard, abroad she owes, And Heads expert at home for Council chose. The State of Britain, thus prodigious grown, It is not Churchill's Arm supports alone; For other Heroes make, by ANNE's Command, Their Thunders fear'd at Sea, like his by Land: And Peterborough wants no Wreaths in Spain, By whose officious Toil, a Crown is Charles's Gain. But as no Empire yet so blest has bin, That had not still some Enemies within: Them too with Art uncommon she subdues, And Mildness is the Weapon she doth use: Such Means to conquer Faction seldom fail, For where the Queen proves weak, the Mother does prevail. Now sure, Tallard, a Princess fram'd like Her, Necessity of Winning must infer. The certain Danger to thy Master paint, And thence be canoniz'd thy Country's Saint; Her suff'ring Sons an ended War would ease, The Lenitive alone for their Disease: Where Blood no longer Subjects can afford, It's Husbandry of State, to sheath the Sword. Nor should he think it, of a Blush the Cause, To let a Woman's Tongue impose him Laws; He soon may find, in turning Annals o'er, Kings stooping often on as mean a Score. It grates, I know, to that soft Sex to bow, Which Custom still the Weaker does allow. But let him see what States Eliza shook, Or on the Roman dread Bonduca took; Then tell the Trophies which adorn the Throne Of our third Female Boast; and sure he'll own, (Howe'er it justly may to some belong) In British Queens, at least, the Attribute is wrong. An ODE occasion'd by the Battel of Ramellies. By Mr. B?y. How will the grateful Senate praise! What new recording Pillars raise! That with Eternal Battles glow To kindle Britains for the Foe. Our Roman Sires to Merit free, Profuse of Immortality; Of Him who had his Country serv'd, In various Piles the Fame preserv'd: On Earth the Hero frown'd in Brass, And shook the Skies with Jove in Verse: His Fellows on his Fame rely, And swear by his Divinity: Had Fate indulg'd the Roman Name, And with a Churchill swell'd her Fame, New Obelisks had reach'd the Skies, And shadow'd half their Deities. Pharsalia vanish'd in the Blaze Of Blenheim, and of Rammelies! But meaner Paths the Roman trod, By making Slaves to grow a God: Whilst Britain's Hero never gains A Conquest, but to break their Chains; From whose each glorious Toil might rise A Cæsar, or a Hercules. Thus from his Race the Fair may claim A Title to a Beauty's Fame; Rich in a Lip! a Cheek! a Hand! Or any Charm of Sunderland. The Benefits of a Theatre. Prithee Jerry be quiet, cease railing in vain, Nor banter the Stage with Invectives again; I find thou art ignorant still of its Merit, And rail but as Quakers when warm'd with the Spirit. Shall a Place be put down when we see it affords Fit Wives for great Poets, and W?s for great Lords? Since Angellica blest with a singular Grace Had by her fine Acting preserv'd all his Plays, In an amorous Rapture young Valentine said, One so fit for his Plays, might be fit for his Bed; He warmly pursu'd her, she yielded her Charms, And blest the kind Youngster in her kinder Arms: But at length the poor Nymph did for Justice implore, H'as married her now, tho he'd ? her before. If such things will help to reform thy ill Nature, Prithee Jerry enquire the Truth of the Matter. Ask D?n the Rake what he means at Threescore? Or prithee ask C?n what made her turn W???? To be kept by a Duke there is much to be said for't, Especially too since she soundly is paid for't; Since her Voice and her Eyes could his Grace so bewitch, 'Twas better snap him than be mumbl'd by R?ch. Next ask honest P???ce what the Devil he thinks on, To let his dear Betty be stallion'd by K?n? What Philtres his Lordship made use of to win her, That one so demure should be turn'd to a Sinner? A Saint in appearance, but true Flesh and Blood, Who resisted the Devil as long as she could. So long he attack'd her, the Matter is clear, She perfectly long'd to be ? by a P?. A SIMILE. Dear Thomas, didst thou never pop Thy Head into a Tinman's Shop? There, Thomas, didst thou never see ('Tis but by way of Simile) A Squirrel spend his little Rage, In jumping round a rouling Cage? The Cage, as either side turn'd up, Striking a Ring of Bells a top—; Mov'd in the Orb, pleas'd with the Chimes, The foolish Creature thinks he climbs: But here or there, turn Wood or Wire, He never gets two Inches higher. So fares it with those merry Blades, That frisk it under Pindus Shades, In noble Songs and lofty Odes, They tread on Stars, and talk with Gods: Still dancing in an airy round, Still pleas'd with their own Verses sound: Brought back, how fast so e'er they go, Always aspiring, always low. The Jubilee Necklace; or a Present from C. III. to the D. of M. a Satyr. In days of Yore, when Albion's Kings did break The Papal Yoke that long had gall'd their Neck, Boldly resolv'd to vindicate their Right, Resolv'd with superstitious Rome to fight, Alternate Victories their Armies won, Now th'English conquer, then the English run; Fortune to both alike did prove benign, Doubtful to which the Glory to resign; At length the Britons charg'd the Roman Foe, And put them to a total Overthrow: The Roman Powers being thus o'erthrown, The Roman Pontiff with Paternal Groan Utter'd these Words from his declining Throne. I see the fatal Crisis now is come That puts a Period to our Mother Rome; Methinks my Mitre's fallen off my Head, Methinks my Majesty's already fled; Help, I conjure you, as you hope to share (After my Death) the noble Porph'ry Chair; Help to support the Ark of God from Fall, Whose Ruin needs must overwhelm you all. He said—and strait the Scarlet-Brother rose, Whose Robes conform'd in colour to his Nose: His Speech (as well became a Man of God) Scented of Fire, of Faggot and of Blood; He mov'd his Holiness to try again By open Force, his Fortune on the Plain. He sat—and soon arose another Son Of the same Church, but a more prudent one: May't please your Holiness, the Card'nal cry'd, Some under-handed Dealings must be try'd; Some private Envoys into Britain send, They most infallibly will gain your end. Scarce had he spoke, when all the Conclave said, Those means, and those alone should be essay'd. They call'd St. Dominick, a Sparkish Fry'r, One of Address, a Person de-bon-aire, Who long a Confessor to Nuns had been, Who all the Female Weaknesses had seen; Him they commission'd into Britain, there Amongst the British Wheat, to sow the Romish Tare: Him they instruct t'attack the Female Sex, Soft and compliant as the Ductile Wax: Strictly they charg'd him all such means to try As best would sute with Female Levity. The Fryer thus instructed, wafted o're To Fertile Albion's Sea-surrounded shoar; Where being arriv'd, a cunning Scheme he drew O'th' Measures he intended to pursue: Soon he, by his insinuating Art, Subdu'd the Fort of fair Corinna's Heart; To her, the Priest a Necklace did present, Whose very Make explain'd the bad Intent Of him that gave it: at the end there hung A Cross of Beads most exquisitely strung. Thus then the Frier (when the Crucifix Hung down from bigotted Corinna's Neck) His Kisses to the Pendant Cross address't; But his Design's to kiss Corinna's Breast. Simple Corinna in her Necklace prides, Whilst Priest her Folly secretly derides; He laughs to see that Sex impos'd upon, To see the Female Sex so eas'ly won, To see the Women glory in their Shame, And value what's destructive of their Fame. How pleasant is't for cunning Priest to pray, And seem to th'Crucifix his Pray'rs to say, Whilst wanton Hands and Minds do strole another way? How leud is't in the Bosom Cross to set, As if you'd say, This Place is to be let? What is it but to tempt the Wanton Priests To wish to be a Cross to lie betwixt your Breasts? “Corinna, vainer Lovers to intice, “By this pretended Signal prompts their Vice, “While they pay Homage to her flowing Breast, “The pointing Jewel represents the rest. “Thus outward Zeal they to that Image show, “But 'tis the Idol's meant that dwells below: “She meant it to her self, and 'tis as good “To have it spoke, as have it understood. No sooner had Corinna us'd the Fashion, But all the Modish Ladies in the Nation Resolv'd to imitate Corinna's Dress, And wear dependant Cross between their Breasts; Thus the Contagion o'er the Sex did fly, And all were pleas'd with Popish Frippery. The Priest well knew he soon should win the Men, Could he but o'er their Wives a Conquest gain; For Man has always us'd to be, from Adam, Yielding to th'Will of his Endearing Madam. So subtle Serpent first with Eve began, And having won her, overreach'd the Man; Just so Rome's Priests (the Serpent's Progeny) Do imitate their Father's Policy. But now the time, too soon the time was come, That Dominick must Retrograde to Rome, To tell th'Event of his Commission, To tell what mighty Wonders he had done. Soon as h' arriv'd the Consistory sat, Eager to hear St. Dominick relate The wonderful, th'incredible Success He had i'th' Business of his Holiness. Nor were their Expectations baulkt, for he With all his Art harangu'd the Company, Telling them how successful he had been, What means he us'd the British Hearts to win. This soon made all the Cardinals agree, That Necklaces and such like Foppery Would not impede the Growth of Popery. Then they resolv'd another Priest to send To perfect this, their so Important End. The QUIETUS. How fleeting is Honor? Who'd strive to be Great, Or glitter with Pomp in a Car of the State, When so oft 'tis attended with Phaeton's Fate? Applauses and Glory may prop 'em awhile, The King and the Council alike on 'em smile, Till at length they are caught and trapp'd in a Toil. When S?s first handl'd the Purse and the Mace, His Wit might have told him in Clarendon's Case, He attempted to sit in a Quicksilver Place. But my Lord he was mortal, and each has his Failing, He adher'd to the Court, and practis'd wrong Dealing, Old S?r and M?ve did both fall a Railing. To his Quietus he was forc'd to submit, He'd Blots in his Tables he knew would be hit, Which H?w and some others wou'd never acquit. The King and the Council, as some do surmise, Do juggle together, and seem to advise, While a crafty old Fox rules all in Disguise. The Measures are taken from S?d's Nod, Who in old Macchiavel's Maxims has trod; To pleasure his Prince he'd forfeit his God. A Politick Jack, who in Times is a Peeper, Own'd S?s had Faults, but W?'s would be deeper, Then whip goes the Seal, and adieu my Lord K?r. Epilogue spoken by Mrs. Mountfort at the Theater Royal in Drury Lane, 1705. As a young Lawyer many Years will drudg, In hopes at last to be a lazy Judg; And as a Statesman shows a busy Face, To sneak, or rail himself into a Place: So a young Actress strives your Hearts t'ingage, That some kind Man may take her off the Stage. Were it my Lot, I'm thinking where to choose, And who wou'd best become the Marriage-Noose: Criticks abhor it, Beaus the least are fit, Who more want Manhood, tho they much want Wit. A Country Squire would do, some Loving Hound, That's Bailiff to his Wife, and tills her Ground; Bet then an active Lass finds small Delight In one who drinks all Day, and snores all Night. A Colonel I could like, that loves the War, One that is absent from me half the Year; Returns with Plunder laden, and full Pay, But in two Months he'll game it all away. In short, I think, tho that's a standing Jest, A foolish, plodding Cheapside Husband's best; For City-Wives are grown most Courtly High, And Mourning wear when Foreign Princes die; Tho lately they have found it to their Cost, Many have mourn'd their Husbands Credit lost. But e'er my self to such a Pitch I rate, Let my good Acting first deserve that Fate: A Phœnix once you had, That each allows, [Sighing. Think from Her Ashes I, I only rose; Like her no Pains I'll spare, like her to last, And please in various Ways your various Tast; Believe me, promising, tho Young and Wild, And for the Mother's Worth support the Child. A Dialogue between Pasquin and Morforio, Two Statues in Rome. Mor. Why how now Pas?? since the last Election, I thought you had no Business for Reflection? French Luid-ores, that never us'd to fail, Have lost their Virtue now, and can't prevail; And honest Clement wisely does espouse, Distinctions laid aside, the Common Cause. Pas. True, but the English Senators have made Themselves the Subject of a Pasquinade— Mor. Pray hold your Tongue. Pas— Why so? I need not fear. Their Serjeant surely cannot reach me here. Mor. Their Privileges daily they extend, For, like the World to come, they're without End; And if their Pow'r but equally increase, You may have Cause to wish you'd held your Peace. But what's the Quarrel? Pas— I can make it out, That tho 500 us'd to Sit and Vote, (At least 400 Senators and odd) They're now reduc'd to 4. Morf— To 4? Pas— To 4 indeed. One M, one S, two H H's, and no more, The Nation represent, and that's but Four. The rest are (o's) and no Number make, Unless you do from these the Units take. Mor. How can that be? Pas— If you desire to know, Ned will inform you, and Jack tell you HOW. Ask at Vienna, Shall we War proclaim? To be resolv'd they'll bid you go to them: And at the Hague they'll tell you, It's as they, And not the King and his Allies shall say. Huffing D' Avaux does vaunt and swear Be Gar, My Master do de Dutch nor no Confederate fear, If S. and Shak Hoo 'gainst him don declare: Dem he vill make his own, and den vid ease, Can winde and turn de rest wich vay dey please. But who, except Lewis le Grand, that knows The Force of Luid'ores, would e'er suppose, That Four should lead Four Hundred by the Nose! The Nine K?s. Will's wafted to Holland on some State Intrigue, Or gone for to visit his Hog?ns at Hague; For fear in his Absence his Subjects repine, He canton'd his Kingdom, and left 'em to Nine, Eight ignorant P?rs, and a Blockish D?ne. To make up the Hydra there's C?, that dull Tool, Who governs the Church as the State he does rule. To make their Commissions more glibly run down, 'Twas wisely contriv'd to hedg in the Gown; P?ke the Sage, who o'er all does preside, Flush'd with Champaign is a giddy rash Guide. If the Goblet but airs his Brain and his Pulse, The State's in an Ague, and we are convuls'd. D?e the Haughty, the Blustring Rake, Is just fit to govern the Arse in the Peak; Who tortures his Tenants, and nought will defray, We quickly shall see how a Scepter he'll sway. The K? had better have kept to the Law, To banter a Witness, and find out a Flaw, What he knows in the State I'd not give him a Straw. 'Tis true, he's translated by some lucky Hit, Like the Frog in the Fable he'll swell till he split; The Conclusion will prove him to be a stark Ass, He'd better have kept to his Fees and his Glass. The Monarch was mad, or he'd ne'er have employ'd A Blab in the State, that his Secrets descry'd. Now M?b's advanc'd, yet most of the Wise Will have him to rule as his Wife does advise. Some Lady at Court perhaps may repine, She is a Lord Justice as well as the Nine. The Prophecy, 1703. The attribution of this poem is questionable. 1 When Great Nassau is dead and gone, That Hero of the British Throne, Whose Equal never will be known. 2 When Rogues bare-fac'd appear in Packs, When State Physicians are all Quacks, And Privy Counsellors are Jacks. 3 When Contradictions do meet, And Knaves are at the Helm of State, Tho faithful and unfortunate. 4 When M?h, G?n, L?y, Have acted over the old Story, And Ireland has been rul'd by Tory. 5 When S?, H?, and Jack H? Agree the Nation to undo, Tho each would hang the other two. 6 When nauseous Jack can quiet sit, That is, when all his Venom's spit, Of Constitution and of Wit. 7 When Gloucester has smelt out the Knave, And Patriot Jack Recourse must have To Foreign Borough to inslave. 8 When England's Interest is seen clearly, When Parties carry matters fairly, And Trimming is left off by H?y. 9 When S?r scorns Salt-Petre Pence, When Bolles to Bedlam 'as no pretence, And any B?tie can talk Sense. 10 When H?ges, richly worth the Gallows, For what the Magdalen College tells us, Shall represent those very Fellows. 11 When Worth's prefer'd without the Ready, When wav'ring B?le is once fixt steddy, When H?s is less Knave than Ady. 12 When Harry B?le shall keep less Pother With his no Hair, and be no Lover, Or be as honest as his Brother. 13 When B?gton is in Disgrace, 'Cause he won't vote to get a Place, Tho promis'd, is not call'd his Grace. 14 When Tories fall into a Trance, And give up dear Non-Resistance, And cease to wish Success to France. 15 When M?ve, who long seem'd proof-Place, The first that's vacant does embrace, To Geese and Ganders the same Sauce. 16 When honest Men dare shew their Faces, When Wit and Sense are no Disgraces, When C?by has no minc'd Places. 17 When R?h has left his Puns, When C?ts has only his Coach Duns, And Jack's Lieutenant of the Guns. 18 When he has Places in Possession, For having open made Profession, Against the Protestant Succession. 19 That chief of the informing kind, To whom old Escrick's Soul we find By wondrous Transmigration join'd. 20 When England's Bulwark, our great Fleet, That never should fear odds they meet, Shall basely on the Square retreat. 21 When comes to nought our great Descent, And most Men think 'twas never meant, When R?ks are on such Errands sent. 22 When S?s, whom all Knaves do dread, The truest Britan e'er was bred, Shall therefore lose his able Head. 23 When W?t one prudent thing has done, T'exchange the lopt one for his own; Better have that that's off than none. 24 When Church to Charity is given, That is, when Numbers odd or even, Or Rowe's in Chappel of St. Stephen. 25 When the dull Dutch turn merry Grigs, When true-born Englishmen turn Prigs, When Bishops are condemn'd for Whigs. 26 When S?m shall leave off to swive, And under C?n's Trade shall thrive, The dullest Clergy-man alive. 27 When Western Prelates swear and rant, And 't does appear that there's no want Of Sense in Honest T? of Cant. 28 When Ned, omniscient Proto-Martyr, To calver'd Salmon shall give Quarter, Or leave his Trade of following after. 29 When E?x shall forswear the Rummer, And spend with his own Wife a Summer, And for St. A?s leave dear P?r. 30 When W?m's crooked fulsom Relict, Of Sense and Shape intirely Belgick, Shall be by B?d deem'd Angellick. 31 When Men can fancy such a Whale, And such old stuff is made a Stale, To catch our silly Dukes withal. 32 When Tear-shirt W?n, fam'd for wenching, His Whores and Gardens is retrenching, Or shall consent to let the French in. 33 When France shall faithfully keep Leagues, When Maintenon leaves State Intrigues, And Men are born with two left Legs. 34 When these Strange things shall come to pass, England shall be, or I'm an Ass, The strangest Queendom ever was. The Country Parson's Advice to those little Scriblers, who pretend to write better Sense than Great Secretaries: Or, Mr. Stephens's Triumph over the Pillory, 1706. Be wise as Ad?n, as Br?ne be brave, As Philips Airy, and as Jones look Grave; Humble as Prior be; Sachev'rell's Zeal, For Church and Loyalty, will fit you well; Like Pittis, I would have you love the Church, But not like him, be by her left i'th' Lurch, For the well governing your Poetry, Rymer and Dennis let your Patterns be: And if it be at last your Scribling Fate To triumph o'er a Pill'ry, e'er too late, Like me recant, and be not obstinate. Remember Tutchin's Boldness for his Cause, That stood the fiery Trial of the Laws. When sneaking Scriblers poorly sue for Grace, He triumphs o'er 'em with an honest Face. So Ridpath smiles at all Fate's harsh Decrees, But can't be pleas'd, when forc'd to pay his Fees, When Parchment-Rolls, like murd'ring War appears, Libels, that raise the trembling Poets fears, And set Mankind together by the Ears. These to avoid, in dull Translation Trade, Bowyer, and Savage, and Oldmixon read; Or deal in News, and write whate'er you will, But mind you Scrible on the right Side still: Then you may Letters from Altea bring, If like Fontvive, 'tis with a just Design To please the Government and serve the Queen. So writes De Foe, an Author now in Vogue, Who was so lately Pillor'd for a R?????; Therefore let his Example, yours be made; Neither of Fines, nor Pillories, be afraid. Lesly wites on, and Gildon still is free To laugh at Ward for writing Poetry; Whose Prose escapes the Censure of the Times, And Informations fall on jingling Rhymes. To sum up all; let Drake's just Merit be A Caution to Poetick Liberty. Since Ward's true Genius, and since Gildon's Sense, At last has brought them to a Dearth of Pence, 'Tis hard their Learning, and each Turn of Wit, Should only make them for this Triumph fit. A New Prologue spoken at the Theatre in Lincolns-Inn-Fields, on Saturday, July the 8th, 1704. in Praise of the Wells. Why is great Phœbus stil'd the God of Lays, Who proves so great an Enemy to Plays? Most Products thrive by those prolifick Fires, By which the Languid, Drooping Stage expires. The Sun calls forth the Town to Rural Sport, For Wilds and Fields ye change the Stage and Court, To Baths and Wells the Beaus and Belles resort. To Wells, that great Receit which Doctors give; To Wells, by which none but Physicians live; To Wells, that heal the Gout, and cause the Stone; To Wells, that give ten Pains in curing one. There the dull Splenetick is cur'd of Life, And the tormented Husband eas'd of Wife. For Wife, the worst of Plagues, as some suppose, Is carry'd off by Waters, or by Beaus. Their painful Love, to Youth the worst Mishap, Is cur'd by that most sure Receit, a Clap. There finds a Virgin Help, with Fits upon her, Of that most languishing Disease call'd Honour. There the young Squire, sick of his happy Fate, Is purg'd of Folly, and a great Estate. There barren Spouse is sent by trading Sot, And there a Pox, or Alderman is got. In short, of all Degrees the Wells draw some; But more are those call'd by the Martial Drum: The Tragick Scenes Abroad spoil those at Home. Tragick indeed, but Tragick to our Foes; Let wide Germania sing, Germania knows, How much to Britain's Bravery she owes. To Anna's Arms the Austrian owes his Crown, She saves the Father, and restores the Son. Upon the first fit of the Gout. Welcome thou friendly Earnest of Fourscore, Promise of Health, that hast alone the Power T'attend the Rich, unenvy'd by the Poor. Thou that dost Esculapius deride, And o'er his Gallypots in Triumphs ride: Thou that art us'd t'attend the Royal Throne, And under-prop the Head that wears the Crown: Thou that in Privy-Councils oft dost wait, And guardst from drousy Sleep the Eyes of State: Thou that upon the Bench art mounted high, And warnst the Judges how they tread awry: Thou that dost oft from pamper'd Prelates Toe, Emphatically urge the Pains below: Thou that art always half the City's Grace, And addst to solemn Noddles solemn Pace: Thou that art ne'er from Velvet Slippers free, Whence comes this unsought Honour unto me? Whence does this mighty Condescension flow To visit my poor Tabernacle? Oh! As Jove vouchsaf'd on Ida's top, 'tis said, At poor Philemon's Cot to take a Bed; Pleas'd with his poor, but hospitable Feast, Jove bid him ask and granted his Request. So do thou grant (for thou'rt of Race Divine, Begot on Venus by the God of Wine) My humble Suit; and either give me Store To entertain thee, or ne'er see me more. Upon Dr. B's Suit to the E. of N. for a Bishoprick. Among the little Pages that were sent With Morning How D'yes, and a Compliment, Was seen a lofty Member of the Church, Whose Name I think they said was Dr. B. With Primitive Humility he sat, Fawning and cringing at the Lady's Gate; Trying t'ingage the Porter in Discourse, Whether her Grace were better now or worse: In hopes by just Degrees he might ascend, And to the waiting Maid his Business recommend. The honest Porter, easy of Access, Began his Brother Gown-man to caress: And soon familiar grown in close Debate, Told him some secret Mysteries of State. The wou'd-be-Prelate vainly now began To think he should a Dignity obtain; And pleas'd with the new Friendship he had gain'd, Hasted forthwith to kiss black Dicky's hand; Dicky the black, whose great and favorite Name Is known as far as that of Nottingham; Dicky who to the Church was ever kind, Thrice shook his Hand, thrice swore he'd be his Friend. Slighted, contemn'd, and scorn'd by Men of Sense, Noted for Ignorance and Impudence, Thus meanly he is forc'd t'implore the Aid Of Porter, Valet, Page, and Chambermaid. Next let us trace him to the Western Quire, And see with what Applause he fills the Chair. With such a Graceful Boldness does he teach, You'd swear all was his own that he did preach. So gay in borrow'd Feathers does he shine; But Sprat and South are known in every Line. For South's deep Learning always will appear, And Sprat will be distinguish'd by the Ear. My Brother B. crys Sprat in Courtly tone, Hath to my Sermons too much Honour done. Whilst rugged South, made of a coarser Mould, Swears he's a Thief, and scandalously bold. Some do indeed admire his wondrous Height, As if he could support the Churches Weight; That he alone could bear the Ballance down, 'Gainst Whiggish Primate and the Scotish Loon: With Care he will the Right Divine maintain, And many Female Proselytes he'll gain. With the fair Sex Knaves still will most prevail, Hypocrisy with them can never fail. The crafty Priest well knows his subtle Art, And will continue still to act his Part. Whether in Midnight Healths the Bowls go round, Whether at Dice he is with Fortune crown'd; Whether he forms some dark or deep Design, For killing Wives he never thought a Crime; Whether his false deluding Tongue does move To Matrimonial or Incestuous Love. But here my Muse, be silent as the Night, In which he acts those Scenes of leud Delight, Lest thou transgress the bounds of Satyr's Laws, Or Mother-Church espouse her Bully's Cause. The Address, 1704. Ye Men of Might, and muckle Power, Our Representing K?s; Who High-Church Zealots to restore, And Toleration Acts devour, Would make us all your Slaves. You lately told her Majesty, You would retrieve her Honour; 'Tis plain you meant it to deceive: And you'l the Nation's Faults retrieve, By bringing new ones on her. If you would have us think you're true, Let Actions make it known; The Nation's Happiness persue, Her old Miscarriages review, But don't forget your own. Tell us, ye Sons of Emptiness. Explain this Contradiction: How can Contention bring forth Peace, Or how a Nation have Success, Without the Laws Protection? You that with Lawyers so abound, And Men of Elocution; Your M?h, W?t, and N?y send, See if they can your Works defend, As well as Constitution. You meet in Clubs, and strong Cabals, To controvert Elections: But Party Interest there prevails, Merit and Sense of Honour fails, And meets with no Protection. With House of Peers you're wondrous Nice, Of Reputation tender; But they see thro the thin disguise, And where you're foolish, they're as wise, And they're our true Defenders. In Reason, Management, and Law, They turn you round and round; No Age such Bubbles ever saw, The Lines of Justice thwart you draw, And all your Plots confound. With mighty Votes, and furious Bill, You keep a wretched pother; But M? manag'd it so ill, The Cheat came out against your Will, And sav'd Dissenting Brother. The blundring Orator betray'd The Snake of Persecution; The Trojan Ass so loudly bray'd, It made the Nation all afraid, In spite of Elocution. He told you Places were ingross'd In all the wiser Nations, By those that worship God the most; But we have found it to our cost, 'T has here been out of Fashion. For Rogues get into Church and State, And wise Men circumvent; Leudness directs the Magistrate, Knaves rule the Cash, and Fools the Fleet, And both the P?t. With Royal Faith her Majesty Had back'd the Toleration; And you, with English Honesty, Wou'd have her Faith and Vows deny, And ruin all the Nation. No wonder you're asham'd to print The Votes of your Proceeding; The Nation soon knew what you meant, And that there would be something in't, That would not bear the reading. Of VVilliam's Grants you now complain, Without regard to Merit; But the leud Gifts of former Reigns, To Whores and Papists, you maintain, And Bastards may inherit. You recognize wise N?m, As one that did his Duty; And there are other Rogues of Fame, To whom you ought to do the same, Because they are so true t'ye. But here the Mischief of it lies, Your Character's a Scandal; For any Knaves in Church-disguise, And any Fool you like's as wise, When we're to be trapan'd all. You are the Men that once cry'd down The Treaty of Partition; After the mighty things y' have done, Pray have you not reduc'd the Crown Into a worse Condition? We wou'd be glad you'd make it plain, And fain we would believe it, When better Terms you'l for us gain, And how those better Terms maintain, That we might all perceive it. The very day you first began Dissenters to reform, Heaven told you 'twou'd be all in vain, And did its just Dislike explain, In a prodigious Storm. But Heaven those Men corrects in vain, Who are for Judgment worse; Who still their Vices will retain, Who first the Blessing dare disdain, And then despise the Curse. In all the grand Faux-Pa's you make, Cou'd you be curs'd alone, Wou'd Heaven such proper Vengeance take, We might not suffer for your sake, You were welcome to go on. Then you might all your selves undo, And for the time to come Make out this Riddle to be true, How you can foreign Wars pursue, By raising Feuds at home. When you look back on William's Reign, And his Mistakes disclose, Of his bad Conduct you complain; But if you'd view it o'er again, 'Twou'd all your own expose. Your want of Temper to the last, Did his Designs defeat, Always too slow, or else too fast, Too backward, or in too much hast, Too cold or else too hot. We wish you would look back upon The modern things you boast, The great Exploits your Fleets have done, The Glory gain'd, the Conquest won, And how much all has cost. With wonted Courage and Success Sir R?k invaded Spain; His wonted Conduct we confess, And all Men own the Happiness, That he's come home again. The Lords have now thrown out your Bill, Which moves your Indignation; But you betray your want of Skill, And manage your Revenge so ill, You're the jest of all the Nation. Your Ancestors with one Consent, Complain'd of Lawless Power; Made Laws our Bondage to prevent, And you of those good Deeds repent, And all those Laws devour. You are the first that are apply'd T'exalt th'encroaching Crown, As if you did not know that Pride, When mounted up, and ask'd to ride, Wou'd pull Religion down. Your Strange Unparallel'd Address No less affronts the Queen, Prompts her the lawful Power t'abuse, Tells her she holds the Reins too loose, And knows not how to reign. Did ever House of K? but you, Like this betray the Nation? Is this our Freedom to pursue, Pray what's Prerogative to you, In representing Station? Your Business is, as all Men know, Our Grievance to redress, Supply the Crown, support it too, But not to prompt, the Lord knows who, The People to oppress. In former time, when Tyrants reign'd, Your Treatments were too rough; But if you'd have your Sense explain'd, You give the Queen to understand, She's not severe enough. Is this the blessed way you take Our Freedoms to defend, To force the Queen her Vows to break, And all her soft Resolves forsake, And abs'lute Power extend? This Nation has had Kings enough That rul'd with Power Despotick, Who of Tyrannick Arts made Proof, And us'd the Nation much too rough, By means and ways Exotic. At these you always snarl'd, and show'd Your discontented Spirit, And now you would be understood, Because you have a Queen too good, You know not how to bear it. With humble Cant, and lowly Speech, How you besiege her Throne, Tell her She is too mild, by Mich, That she must whip the Nation's B?h, And make her Power be known. Have Patience, till by Management You bring your King from France; 'Tis plain, the scope of your Intent Is there, or else the Devils in't, And you're all mad by chance. When your young Hero mounts the Throne, You'll quickly have a Proof; He'll quickly make the difference known, And take just Care to have it shown, He'll tyrannize enough. What Pity 'tis you should be fool'd, And balk'd in your Petition? They who with Scorpions will be rul'd, And they who will be ruin'd, should Be mock'd in their Submission. If e'er Tyrannick Powers possess, And re-reduce the Nation, They'l bear their Date from this Address, And you'l too late your Crimes confess, But merit no Compassion. Now you fall foul upon the Press, And talk of Regulation; When you our Libelling suppress, Pray drop your Votes among the rest, For they lampoon the Nation. You are the Monkeys of the State, And Ape our true Defenders; Heav'n guard us from the hasty Fate, Which wise Men look for from the Cheat Of all such vile Pretenders. You are the Nation's true Lampoon, In Banter be it spoken: If you wou'd save us, 'Tis too soon; And 'tis too late to be undone, Because our Eyes are open. And now you stand in Peer's Records, Usurpers of the Nation; No Men regard your forfeit Words, The Nation's Eyes are on the Lords, And there's our Expectation. Your G?s, W?s, R?s shall there Their due Deserts encounter, And in due time Vile R?r And N?m may both appear To give a black Account there. Assure your selves the Nation will The House of Lords defend, You've lost your Interest and your Skill, And never will regain it, till Your Manners come to mend. That you betray the People's Trust, The Nation knows is true, Are Arbitrary and Unjust; And if we will be sav'd, we must Find other Men than You. And now you cavil with the Lords, Because they first reprov'd you; Your Manners just Remark affords, But most of all your Decent Words, Have R?s and S?s prov'd you. Go home for shame; But first the Queen Address for Dissolution, No more in that high House be seen, Where such a Scandal you ha' been To th'English Constitution. To his Grace the Duke of Marlborough on his late Successes in Flanders, 1706. While you, my Lord, with an extensive Hand, O'er distant Provinces hold wide Command, Mean are those Honours which the Muse can give, That in your Name alone aspires to live. She sees with Rapture your Victorious Arms, The Dawn of Liberty's transporting Charms; Tries her young Pinions, and would soar on high, But dazzl'd, downward is compell'd to fly. Yet who in silence can such Blessings share! Thanks to the Gods a pleasing Tribute are. Thrice happy Britain! Favourite of Heav'n! To whom th'Almighty's righteous Hand has giv'n A Queen, from Ages rolling down design'd To break our Chains, and bless undone Mankind. She was that Godlike Boon reserv'd in Store, When e'er he should Nassau to Heav'n restore. And now impatient to discharge her Trust, She bids the Sword shake off its slavish Rust; Each Warlike Instrument obeys her Will, As you, my Lord, command to save, or kill. O'er all the Confines of the Christian World, As Light'ning swift, her dread Commands are hurl'd. Three mighty People rais'd from sad Distress, The Po, the Danube, and the Rhine confess: But where She does a nearer Friendship own, She there in Plenty pours her Blessings down. Replete with Joy, the grateful Dutch shall tell, How Antwerp, Brussels, mighty Menin fell. Those Towns which late, like an impending Storm, Did all the Neighb'ring Provinces alarm, Do now their Peace, their Liberty confirm. Oft have Batavia's Sons our Queens implor'd, As oft have known their sinking State restor'd: When lab'ring under Alva's heavy Yoke Eliza freed them, and their Bondage broke: Again preserv'd by ANNA's Arms they rise, And vanquish'd France forsakes the glorious Prize. In vain had Industry inlarg'd that Land, Which Nature gave with a penurious Hand; In vain all Arts they 'gainst the Waves explore, Should Tyranny insult their wretched Shore. Crown'd with Success, to curb the Seas they strive, But can no Limits to Ambition give. Nor shall Batavia feel alone that Influence, Which Anna does by Churchil's Hand dispense: Europe and all her grateful Sons shall tell, By what Illustrious Chief proud Gallia fell; How great her Danger, sudden her Relief, Britannia's Glory, and the Tyrant's Grief. Naked and bound Andromeda thus lay, To the Sea's foulest Monster meant a Prey, Nor Tears nor Pray'rs defer the fatal Day. See! the Devourer from afar appears, And his huge Crest above the Billows rears; To either Shore the frighten'd Ocean flies, And far above their Brim the Surges rise. Look down O Ammon! See the wretched Maid! Relent, ye Pow'rs, and send a Godlike Aid: Our Vows are heard, the Gods a Hero give, And the releas'd Andromeda shall live. Faction display'd, a Poem, 1704. To the conceal'd Author of this Excellent Poem. When Dryden's tuneful celebrated Muse Did God-like David for her Subject chuse, She soar'd above her known and common Height, To Heav'n she rais'd her Voice, to Heav'n she took her flight. Such is your Muse's Subject, such her Tongue, Witness this polish'd and melodious Song: Where the same Majesty of Verse, The same just Stile, the same deep Sense appears. No Jests nor Puns deform the study'd Page, But all is manly Thought and noble Rage; But all along the mighty Genius shines, Informs and animates the Sacred Lines. Not Heav'nly Horace more correctly writ, Tho to refine his Sense, united met The Critick's Judgment, and the Poet's Wit. C. D. To the unknown Author of the incomparable Poem, Faction Display'd. O matchless Genius! Whose exalted Lays Transcend my humble and unequal Praise. Not fam'd Apelles Pencil could express The Beauteous Heav'n of Cytherea's Face; Nor any Art your Muse's Image draw, Who what she is, like Light, her self can only show. Let other Poets, in untuneful Verse, Or Delia's, or Lardella's Charms rehearse; Let Songs and Sonnets be their humble Choice, Let them conform their Subjects to their Voice. But you refin'd your more extended Thought (With Judgment, Wit, Experience, Learning fraught) Persues a loftier Theme, a nobler Height, And fathoms all the Secrets of the State; Displays the Wily Arts of Human Kind, How Faction sours the Blood, and knaws upon the Mind. Strong and Majestick does your Stile appear, Your Notions weighty, your Reflections clear. With nicest Art you turn each polish'd Line, To make your Darling Celsus in full Lustre shine. But Oh! In what a moving Strain you mourn O'er the belov'd Marcellus sacred Urn; Mingling the sweetest Joy with the severest Grief, Like the fam'd Spear, at once you wound, at once relieve. 'Twas Harmony, as Learned Antients thought, The Nat'ral World to Form and Order brought, And may your Heav'nly ever tuneful Lays Make all our Factions, our Divisions cease, Charm and compose the Moral World to Peace. H. B. Faction Display'd. Say, Goddess Muse, for thy All-searching Eyes Can Traytors trace thro ev'ry dark Disguise, Can penetrate Intriguing Statesmens Hearts, Their deepest Plots, and all their wily Arts. Say, how a Fierce Cabal combin'd of late, Imploy their anxious Thoughts t'imbroil the State; What angry Pow'r inspires 'em to complain In Anna's Gentle and Propitious Reign. Faction, a restless and repining Fiend, Curdles their Blood, and gnaws upon their Mind: Off-spring of Chaos, Enemy to Form, By whose destructive Arts the World is torn. She taught the Giants to attempt the Sky, And Jove's avenging Thunder to defy. She rais'd the Hand, that struck the fatal Blow, Which martyr'd Jove's Vicegerent here below: She still pursues him with relentless Hate, Arraigns his Mem'ry, and insults his Fate. 'Tis She, that would, for ev'ry slight Offence, Depose a true Hereditary Prince; That would Usurpers for their Treason crown, Till Time and Vengeance drag them headlong down, And exil'd Monarchs reassert their rightful Throne. No Constitution in the World can boast A Scheme of Laws more rational, more just, Than England's are; where Sovereign, Kingly Sway Is mixt and qualify'd with such Allay, That Free-born Subjects willingly obey: Nor yet so basely mixt, as that our Kings Are only Tools of State, and Pow'rless Things. For tho, indeed, they can have no Pretence With Fundamental Contracts to dispense, (For that were Conquest) yet, those Rights maintain'd, Prerogative is high, and unrestrain'd; In equal Distance from Extremes we move, No Tyranny, nor Commonwealth approve. Nor Tyranny, that Savage Brutal Pow'r, Which not protects Mankind, but does devour: Nor Commonwealth, a Monster, Hydra State, Whose many Heads threaten each others Fate, And load their Body with unweildy Weight: But a successive Monarchy we own, With all the lawful Sanctions of a Crown. Such was our old establish'd English Frame, Which might have flourish'd Ages yet the same, But for this envious Fiend; who still prepares To sow the Seed of long intestine Wars. Near the Imperial Palace's Remains, Where nothing now but Desolation reigns, (Fatal Presage of Monarchy's Decline, And Extirpation of the Regal Line!) There stands an Antique Venerable Pile, Whose Lords were once the Glories of our Isle: But now it mourns that Race of Hero's dead, And droops, and hangs its melancholy Head. This Pile (howe'er for better Ends design'd, An Emblem of the Noble Founder's Mind) Is Faction's Refuge; where she keeps her Court, Where all her darling Votaries resort. Here, when their glorious N? fell, they met On new Resolves and Measures to debate. Say then, my Muse, their secret Thoughts display, Expose their dark Designs to open Day. This Grand Cabal was held at dead of Night, (For Ghosts and Furies always shun the Light) Despair, and Rage, and Sorrow kept 'em dumb, Till Moro rose (the Master of the Dome) A Stamm'ring, Hot, Conceited, Laughing L?, Who prov'd his want of Sense in ev'ry Word; When hissing thus, his fetter'd Tongue broke loose, ‘I take it as an Honour that you've chose ‘For this Debate, your humble Servant's House. ‘The House henceforward shall recorded stand ‘As the Palladium of the sinking Land; ‘And I to future Ages be renown'd, ‘The Party's Bulwark, and the Nation's Mound. ‘Now N?, the immortal N?'s gone, ‘We justly his untimely Herse bemoan. ‘O that I could restore his Life again! ‘For who can bear a Woman's servile Chain? Full of such stuff, he would have giv'n it vent, But that black Ario's Fierceness did prevent; A Scotch, Seditious, Unbelieving Priest, The brawny Chaplain of the Calves-Head-Feast; Who first his Patron, then his Prince betray'd, And does that Church, he's sworn to guard, invade; Warm with Rebellious Rage, he thus begun: ‘To talk of calling Life agen is vain. ‘Peace to the glorious Dead. We justly mourn ‘His Ashes, ever sacred be his Urn: ‘But here, my L?, we're all together met, ‘To vow to A?'s Sceptre endless Hate. ‘For since my hope of VVinton is expir'd, ‘With just Revenge and Indignation fir'd, ‘I'll write, and talk, and preach her Title down, ‘My thundring Voice shall shake her in the Throne; ‘Do you the Sword, and I'll engage the Gown. A Pause ensu'd, till Patriarcho's Grace Was pleas'd to rear his huge unweildy Mass; A Mass unanimated with a Soul, Or else he'd ne'er be made so vile a Tool; He'd ne'er his Apostolick Charge profane, And Atheists, and The Maidstone Lecture. Fanaticks Cause maintain. At length, as from the Hollow of an Oak, The Bulky Primate yawn'd, and Silence broke. ‘I much approve my Brother's zealous Heat, ‘Such is the noble Ardour of the Great, ‘On which Success and Praise will ever wait. ‘But I'm untaught in Politician Schools, ‘Unpractis'd in their Arts, and studied Rules, ‘By which they make the Wisest of us Fools. ‘The Task be therefore yours, to forge some Plot, ‘And I'll be ready with my trusty Vote, ‘Nor e'er give your Commands a second Thought. ‘Tho I were mute, you must confess I've stood, ‘Fixt as a Rock, amidst the beating Flood: ‘Witness St. A?ph's, and St. D?d's Cause, ‘Where obstinately I transgress'd the Laws; ‘And did in either Case Injustice show, ‘Here sav'd a Friend, there triumph'd o'er a Foe. Then old Mysterio shook his Silver Hairs, Loaded with Learning, Prophecy and Years, Whom Factious Zeal to fierce Unchristian Strife, Had hurry'd in the lest Extream of Life. Strange Dotage! Thus to sacrifice his Ease, When Nature whispers Men to crown their days With sweet Retirement and Religious Peace! Fore-knowledg struggl'd in his heavy Breast, E'er he in these dark Terms his Fears exprest. ‘The Stars rowl adverse, and malignant shine, ‘Some dire Portend! some Comet I divine! ‘I plainly in the Revelations find, ‘That A? to the Beast will be inclin'd. ‘Howe're, tho She, and all her Senate frown, ‘I'll wage eternal War with P?ton, ‘And venture Life and Fame to pull him down. As he went on, his Tongue a trembling seiz'd, And all his Pow'r of Utterance suppress'd. So when the Sibyl felt th'Inspiring God, She raving lost her Voice, and speechless stood. Unhappy Church, by such Usurpers sway'd! How is thy Prim'tive Purity decay'd? How are thy Prelates chang'd from what they were, When Laud or Sancroft fill'd the sacred Chair? Laud, tho by some traduc'd, with Zeal adorn'd, Whilst Patriarcho is despis'd and scorn'd, Shall be by me for ever prais'd, for ever mourn'd. Sancroft's unblemish'd Life, divinely pure, In its own heav'nly Innocence secure, The teeth of Time, the blasts of Envy shall endure. When for th'establish'd Faith they should contend, Meekness and Christian Charity pretend; But with a blind and unbecoming Rage, For Schism and Toleration they engage; With strange Delight and Eagerness espouse Occasional Conformists shameful Cause; Oppress thy Friends, and vindicate thy Foes. Thy Guardian Laws to weaken they combine, And tamely thy Essential Rights resign. Thy antient Truths with modern Glosses blend, Destroying the Religion they would mend. So have they broke thy Pale and Fences down, Such Arts have Christianity o'rethrown: For Scepticism, that now triumphant reigns, Condemns her Captive to inglorious Chains, Where She Forlorn, Contemn'd, Despairing lies, Nor hopes a Refuge but her Native Skies. But Muse proceed, nor dwell on Thoughts too long, That would inflame thy Satyrizing Song. Clodio, with kindling Emulation, heard What this Triumvirate of Priests declar'd. Clodio, the Chief of all the Rebel-Race, Uncheck'd by Fear, unhumbl'd by Disgrace; Whose Working, Turbulent, Fanatick Mind No Tenderness can move, no Ties can bind. To gain a Rake he'll drink, and whore, and rant, T'engage a Puritan will pray and cant. So Satan can in differing Forms appear, Or radiant Light, or gloomy Darkness wear. Thrice he blasphem'd, and thrice he frantick swore By ev'ry terrible Infernal Pow'r; Then wav'd his Staff, and said: ‘Tho N?'s Death has all our Measures broke, ‘Yet never will we bend to A?'s Yoke. ‘The glorious Revolution was in vain, ‘If Monarchy once more its Rights regain. ‘Let all be Chaos, and Confusion all, ‘E're that damn'd Form of Government prevail. ‘O had he liv'd to perfect his Design, ‘We ne'er had been subjected to her Reign, ‘But rooted out the St?ts hated Line! ‘Howe'er, since Fate has otherwise decreed, ‘We may on his unfinish'd Scheme proceed. ‘We may 'gainst Pow'r repos'd in one inveigh, ‘And call all Monarchy Tyrannick Sway. ‘We may the Praises of the Dutch advance, ‘Rail at the Arbitrary Rule of France: ‘Extol the Commonwealth in Adria's Flood, ‘Which for ten rowling Centuries has stood: ‘Argue how th'Roman and Athenian State ‘Were only, when Republicks, truly Great. ‘'Tis easy the Unreas'ning Mob to guide, ‘For they are always on the Factious Side. ‘This labor'd here, 'twill be our next Resort, ‘To manage and cajole S?'s Court. ‘To?nd alone for such a Work is fit, ‘In all the Arts of Villany compleat. ‘The Scotch, a Rough, Revolting, Stubborn Kind, ‘Have long at England's growing Power repin'd. ‘Nor need we with unnecessary Care, ‘Endeavour to foment Rebellion there. ‘For scarce our N?'s Empire they endur'd, ‘Tho he their antient Liberties restor'd, ‘And murm'ring now they ask a foreign Lord. ‘But (Health suppos'd) to This Project was once talk'd of. Ireland I'll repair, ‘And right or wrong usurp the Common's Chair; ‘That Point once gain'd, we'll soon secure our Cause, ‘Soon undermine our hot-brain'd tow'ring Foes. ‘At least I'll substitute some wealthy Friend, ‘Who shall with Heat and Arrogance contend ‘To thwart the Court in ev'ry just Command. So Catiline the Fate of Rome design'd, And when h'had form'd the Scheme within his Mind, In such a warm Harangue his Friends addrest, And open'd all the Secrets of his Breast. This hit Sigillo's Thoughts, and made him cool, Tho just before he scarcely could controul The stormy Passion swelling in his Soul; His restless Soul, that rends his sickly Frame, Worn with a poys'nous and corroding Flame; An unjust J?e, and blemish of the M?, Witness the Bankers long depending Case; A shallow Statesman, tho of mighty Fame, For who can e'er that crust Par?on name, But to his foul Disgrace, and to his Shame? Besides, in spight of all his loud Defence, He shew'd a want of Honesty or Sense, In passing ev'ry plund'ring Courtier's Grants. He is (for Satyr dares the Truth declare) Deist, Republican, Adulterer. Thus his lov'd Clodio for his Speech he prais'd, And Joy and Wonder in the Hearers rais'd. ‘There spoke the Guardian Genius of our Cause, ‘Whose ev'ry Word deserves divine Applause. ‘Not ev'n The Person here represented, was living at the time of this Cabal. Cethego's self could form a Plot, ‘More nicely spun, more exquisitely wrought; ‘Tho he, to his immortal envied Fame, ‘The Glory of the Revolution claim. ‘'Twas his profound unfathomable Wit, ‘Did James, and all his Jesuit-Train defeat. ‘He knew Reveal'd Religion was a Jest, ‘Impos'd upon the World by some designing Priest; ‘Nor therefore fear'd, but to their Idols bow'd, ‘Prevaricating with his King, his God. ‘A Proteus, ever acting in Disguise; ‘A finish'd Statesman, intricately wise; ‘A second Machiavel, who soar'd above ‘The little Tyes of Gratitude and Love; ‘Whose harden'd Conscience never felt Remorse; ‘Reflection is the puny Sinner's Curse. ‘But why should I Cethego's Praise pursue, ‘When all his Vertues, Clodio, shine in you? ‘You can another Revolution frame, ‘The same your Principle, your Skill the same. ‘Whilst then the wav'ring Irish are your Care, ‘Believe we'll use our utmost Efforts here, ‘Nor Time, nor Pains, nor Health, nor Mony spare. ‘Cethego in your Absence shall preside ‘O're our Debates, and ev'ry Consult guide: ‘Like the supreme directing Hand of Jove, ‘Shall act unseen, and all around him move. ‘I, as the Moderator of the Laws, ‘Will find a way to sanctify our Cause, ‘Will prove, in Passive Jacobites despight, ‘Rebellion is a free-born Peoples Right. ‘Then as we take our Circuits thro the Land, ‘We'll mould the stern Freeholders to our Hand; ‘Awe their Elections, and their Votes command. ‘When with our faithful City-Friends we dine, ‘We'll mingle Treason with the flowing Wine. ‘We'll plant in every Coffee-house a Spy, ‘That boldly shall the Ministry decry; ‘Shall praise the past, the present Reign condemn, ‘And all their Measures, all their Councils blame: ‘Shall spread a thousand idle, groundless Tales, ‘Of foreign Gold, the Pope, and P?ce of W?: ‘Shall never fail Objections still to raise, ‘(Whatever is transacted with Success) ‘And turn their greatest Honour to Disgrace. ‘This Chymick Art, perverting Nature's Law, ‘From sweetest Things will rankest Poyson draw. Narcisso next, magnificently Gay, Smil'd his Assent, but not a Word would say. He fear'd to strain his Voice by talking loud, Nor was his Quail-pipe made for such a Croud. A batter'd Beau, yet youthful in Decay, Who dresses, whores, and games his time away. Fond of Sedition, but indulging Vice With all that Wealth, profusely spent, supplies. And yet this Debauchee pretends to claim An injur'd Patriot's Meritorious Name. Then squeal'd Orlando, but his furious Heat Shew'd him for cool mature Debates unfit, Nor will we here the blustring Speech repeat. A Bully L?, whose wild mad Looks proclaim His Bosom warm'd with more than Hero's Flame. Fighting and Railing are his chief Delight, Promiscuously opposing Wrong and Right. Whate'er he does is always in Extreams, Sometimes the Whig, sometimes the Tory damns. His various Temper and impetuous Mind, To ev'ry Party is by Starts inclin'd. He never was, nor e'er will be content With any Prince, with any Government. Last rose Bathillo, deck'd with borrow'd Bays, Renown'd for others Projects, others Lays. A gay, pragmatical, pretending Tool, Opiniatively wise, and pertly dull. A Demy Statesman, Talkative and Loud, Hot without Courage, without Merit proud; A Leader fit for the unthinking Croud. With dapper Gesture, but with haughty Look, His leud Associates vainly he bespoke. ‘Do you perform the Politicians Part, ‘I'll bring th'Assistance of the Muses Art. ‘The Poet Tribe are all at my devoir, ‘And write as I command, as I inspire. ‘C?g?ve for me Pastora's Death did mourn, ‘And her white Name with Sable Verse adorn. ‘R? too is mine, and of the Whiggish Train, ‘'Twas he that sung immortal Tamerlane, ‘Tho now he dwindles to an The Fair Penitent. humbler Strain. ‘I help'd to polish G?th's rough, aukward Lays, ‘Taught him in tuneful Lines to sound our Party's Praise. ‘W?sh Votes with us, who, tho he never writ, ‘Yet passes for a Critick and a Wit. ‘Van's Baudy, Plotless Plays were once our boast, ‘But now the Poet's in the Builder lost. ‘On A?son we safely may depend, ‘A Pension never fails to gain a Friend. ‘Thro Alpine Hills he shall my Name resound, ‘And make his Patron known in Classick Ground. ‘These pay the Tribute to my Merit due, ‘Call me their Horace, and Mecænas too. ‘Princes but sit unsettl'd on their Thrones, ‘Unless supported by Apollo's Sons. ‘Augustus had the Mantuan, and Venusian Muse, ‘And happier N? had his M?gues. ‘But A?, that ill fated Tory Queen, ‘Shall feel the Vengeance of the Poet's Pen. Triton, who like the vast Leviathan Long wallow'd in the Treasures of the Main, Was all Attention, and suspended hung, For ev'ry Rebel Heart has not a Tongue. Besides, there stood a num'rous Train of P?, Below the Notice of Recording Verse. Beaus, Biters, Pathicks, B?rs and Cits, Tosters, Kit-Kats, Divines, Buffoons and Wits Compos'd the medly Crew; but I forbear To give 'em any Place, or Mention here. For since the Muse would blush to paint their Crimes, Let Decency restrain th'Invective Rhimes. When thus their Chiefs had spoke, thro all the Throng Repeated Peals of Acclamations rung. Not antient Demagogues, with more Applause, Asserted and espous'd the Rabble's Cause. Now this Assembly to adjourn prepar'd, When Biblipolo from behind appear'd, As well describ'd by th'old Satyrick Bard; With Leering Looks, Bullfac'd and Freckled fair, With two left Legs, and Judas colour'd Hair, With Frowzy Pores, that taint the ambient Air. Sweating and puffing for a while he stood, And then broke forth in this insulting Mood. ‘I am the Touchstone of all Modern Wit, ‘Without my stamp in vain your Poets write. ‘Those only purchase everliving Fame, ‘That in my Miscellany plant their Name: ‘Nor therefore think that I can bring no Aid, ‘Because I follow a Mechanick Trade, ‘I'll print your Pamphlets, and your Rumours spread. ‘I am the Founder of your lov'd Kit-Kat, ‘A Club that gave Direction to the State. ‘'Twas there we first instructed all our Youth, ‘To talk profane, and laugh at Sacred Truth. ‘We taught them how to tost, and rhime and bite, ‘To sleep away the Day, and drink away the Night. Some this fantastick Speech approv'd, some sneer'd, The Wight grew Cholerick, and disappear'd. Mean time the Fury smil'd, who all this while Sat hov'ring on the Summet of the Pile. A secret and exulting Joy she finds, To see her Influence brooding on their Minds; And the bare Prospect of such Noble Ills Her Thoughts with rapt'rous Speculation fills. Then She— ‘With what delight do I my Sons behold, ‘So resolutely brave, so fiercely bold? ‘Sure nothing can resist their boundless Course, ‘Nothing subdue their well-united Force. ‘Volpone, who will solely now command ‘The publick Purse, and T???s???e of the Land, ‘Wants Constancy and Courage to oppose ‘A Band of such exasperated Foes. ‘For how shall he that moves by Craft and Fear, ‘Or ever greatly think, or ever greatly dare? ‘What did he e'er in all his Life perform, ‘But shrunk at the Approach of every Storm; ‘But when the tott'ring Church his Aid requir'd, ‘With Moderation Principles inspir'd, ‘Forsook his Friends and decently retir'd. ‘Nor has he any real just Pretence ‘To that vast Depth of Politicks and Sense. ‘For where's the Depth, when Publick Credit's high, ‘To manage an o'reflowing T???s???y? ‘Or where the Sense to know the Tricks of Game, ‘Since S??ms, Sir Ja??es, H??ll??way may claim ‘A Knowledg as profound as his, as loud a Fame? ‘I fear the Man, who dares the Truth assert, ‘Who never plays the Double-dealing Part; ‘The Patriot's Soul disdains the Trimmer's Art. ‘Such Celsus is, but I foresee his Fate ‘To be supplanted by Sempronia's Hate. ‘(Sempronia of a leud procuring Race, ‘The Senate's Grievance, and the Court's Disgrace.) ‘'Tis well he cannot long his Ground maintain, ‘For Hell would then imploy her Fiend in vain. ‘He never knew to prostitute the State, ‘Never by being guilty to be Great. ‘Nor yet when Publick Storms came rowling on, ‘Did he or Danger or his Duty shun. ‘Rome's subtle Priests with Sophistry essay'd, ‘With Wealth and Honor in the Ballance laid, ‘To shock his Faith; but nothing could controul ‘The firm Resolves of his unbyass'd Soul, ‘True to his Conscience, as the Needle to the Pole. ‘Ally'd in Blood and Friendship to the Throne, ‘He nobly makes his Country's Cause his own; ‘Whilst others keep their Int'rest still in view, ‘And meaner Spirits meaner Ends pursue. ‘So the fixt Stars harmoniously comply ‘With the first Publick Motion of the Sky; ‘Whilst wandring Planets oppositely move, ‘Within the narrow Orbs of private Love. She stopp'd—for now her Anger 'gan to rise, Flush'd in her Cheeks, and sparkl'd in her Eyes. And well it might a Fury's Passion raise, That she was forc'd the Worth, she hates, to praise. The Dawn dispers'd the Croud, she took her flight To the low Regions of Eternal Night. O England, how revolving is thy State! How few thy Blessings! how severe thy Fate! O destin'd Nation, to be thus betray'd By those, whose Duty 'tis to serve and aid! A griping vile degenerate Viper Brood, That tears thy Vitals and exhausts thy Blood. A varying Kind, that no fixt Rule pursue, But often form their Principles anew; Unknowing where to lodg Supreme Command, Or in the King, or Peers, or People's Hand. One while the People's Sov'reignty they own, To vex and load a Peaceful Monarch's Crown; Who to his Subjects when at length restor'd, Without distinction was their common Lord. What Party else to David's happy Throne, Wou'd have prefer'd a giddy Absalon? But when a King is moulded to their Mind, Then they to him would have all Sway confin'd; Nor in their own despotick boundless Reign, Of injur'd Rights, and Property complain: Nay with a Standing Force thy Sons would awe, The Subjects Slavery, the Tyrants Law. But if nor King, nor Commons will comply With their detested Acts of Villany, They strive the Peers declining Pow'r to raise, And get Impeachments voted into Praise. Blest Patriots these, who Liberty imploy, T'elude thy Laws and Liberty destroy! Where is the Noble Roman Spirit fled, Which once inspir'd thy antient Patriots dead? Who were above all private Ends, and joy'd, When bravely for the publick Weal they dy'd: Who spread, like Branching Oaks, their Arms around, To shelter and protect their Parent Ground; Tho Storms of Thunder rattl'd o'er their Head, Yet all was safe beneath their Guardian Shade. Or sure Historians on our Faith impose, And never such a Race of Men arose; Or Nodding Nature to a Period draws; Or Providence, incens'd by guilty Times, With-holds its Grace, and dooms us to our Crimes. Pardon (for Harmony will bring Relief, Will sooth thy anxious Cares, and charm thy Grief) If my condoling mournful Muse presume To visit thy Marcellus Sacred Tomb. For his Hereditary Gifts alone Could have retriev'd thy Fame, and carry'd down, The Glorious Scene of Triumphs Anna has begun. O may thy Angel guard her Royal Mind, That Fav'rites nor seduce, nor Trimmers blind. For 'tis on Her thy Church and State depend, With Her will flourish, and with her will end. But my shock'd Thoughts the sad Idea shun, (The sad Idea gives eternal Moan) When she shall late, but ah! too soon comply With Nature, to adorn her kindred Sky. For who can then pretend to wear her Crown? Who represent the Mother, but the Son? O! had the Pow'r, that governs human Fate, His Years extended to a longer Date. To what transcendance had his Genius sprung, Which was so ripe, so perfect, yet so young! But when fresh blooming Youth seem'd to proclaim The lasting Structure of his Beauteous Frame, When Health and Vigour with a kind Presage, Promis'd the hoary Happiness of Age; Then with a momentary swift Decay, Thy Pride, thy darling Hope was snatch'd away. So by the Course of the revolving Sphears, Whene'er a new discover'd Star appears; Astronomers with Pleasure and Amaze Upon the Infant Luminary gaze. They find their Heav'n inlarg'd, and wait from thence Some blest, some more than common Influence, But suddenly alas! the fleeting Light Retiring leaves their Hopes involv'd in endless Night. Moderation Display'd, A Poem, 1705. By the Author of Faction Display'd. Again my Muse—Nor fear the steepy Flight, Pursue the Fury thro the Realms of Night; Explore the Depth of Hell, the Secret Cause, Whence the New Scheme of Moderation rose. Now Faction re-assum'd her Native Throne, Which prostrate Fiends with awful Homage own; A Crown of eating Flame her Temples bound, Darting a blew malignant Radiance round. An Iron Scepter in her Hand she bore Emblem of Vengeance and destructive Pow'r. A bloody Canopy hung o'er her Head, Where the four falling Empires are pourtray'd. Monarchs depos'd beneath her Foot-stool lie, And all around it Hell and Anarchy. Whilst thus she tow'ring sat, the Subject Train With Shouts proclaim'd the Triumphs of her Reign. Then they the Chaos sung, and Nature's Jars, How the first Atoms urg'd their Medly Wars. How Civil Discord, and Intestine Rage, Have boil'd in ev'ry Nation, ev'ry Age. They sung divided Albion's hapless State, Her Clashing Senate's Feuds, her lab'ring Church's Fate. And, as her coming Ruin they exprest, A sullen Rapture swell'd in ev'ry Breast. For such the Bent of their distorted Will, Only to know Delight in Thoughts of Ill. But on a sudden, Lo! descending flew A Meagre Ghost, which soon the Fury knew; Cethego newly Dead, her Darling Pride, Whose firm unwav'ring Faith she long had try'd: Long in her secret Councils had retain'd, By which her Empire o'er our Isle she gain'd. No sooner was arriv'd the welcome Guest, But him in soothing Terms she thus addrest. Hail best belov'd of all my Sons, receive What Praise, what Joy these gloomy Realms can give. For 'tis to thy successful Arts I owe My Reign above, my Triumph here below. This said, th'unbodied Shade obsequious kneel'd, Struck with Amazement, and with Rapture fill'd. O Mighty Queen! Permit me to adore Thy Awful Shrine, thy all-informing Pow'r, Whose nearer Influence my Breast inspires With glorious Rage, and mischievous Desires. 'Twas in thy Cause I sunk a mouldring Frame, Unequal to the hardy Task of Fame. But still my Mind, releas'd from mortal Pains, Her innate Faculty of Ill retains. More he had said, but the surrounding Throng, Impatient of Delay, pursu'd their Noisy Song. Mean time the Fiend revolving in her Thought The mighty Change Cethego's Death had wrought, Resolv'd at length to summon to her Aid Each Plotting Devil, each Seditious Shade. She gave the Signal, and a dreadful Sound Ran bellowing thro all th'Abyss profound. Then thus she eas'd her anxious Soul— O dearest Friends! O faithful Ministers! Ye mutual Partners of my Joys and Cares; New Ways, new Means my restless Thoughts imploy, How Albion to reduce, her Peace destroy. Long have I labor'd, but Alas! in vain, For now succeeds the Heavenly Anna's Reign; Who watchful guards a Stubborn Peoples Good, By Fears not stagger'd, nor by Force subdu'd. Such are the Gifts of her Capacious Mind, Where Justice, Mercy, Piety are join'd. As Motion, Light and Heat combin'd in one, Make up the glorious Essence of the Sun. But still She Mortal is, nor will I cease, 'Till my Revenge be crown'd with wish'd Success. First then, suppose we should devest the Throne Of Friends, whose Souls are kindred to her own. Celsus disgrac'd, Hortensio next appears, Whose Vigilance still baffles all my Cares; To whom by Right of Ancestry belong A Loyal Heart, and a Perswasive Tongue. Now Plots are form'd, and Publick Tempests rowl, He boasts a strange unshaken strength of Soul. Fearless against their Foes the Church sustains, Alike their Friendship and their Hate disdains; Disdains their Clamour and Seditious Noise, Secure in the Applauding Senate's Voice. Of Noble Stem, in whose Collat'ral Lines Virtue with equal Force and Lustre shines. When Suada Pleads, Success attends the Cause, Suada the Glory of the British Laws. Not the fam'd Orators of Old were heard With more attentive Awe, more deep Regard, When thronging round them, their charm'd Audience hung On the attacking Musick of their Tongue. Nor Hell to Lælio can her Praise refuse, Whose Worth deserves his own recording Muse; Who in Sophia's Court with just Applause, Maintain'd his Sov'reign's Rights, his Country's Cause. For 'tis in him, with Anguish, that I find All the Endowments of a Gen'rous Mind, Whate'er is Great and Brave, whate'er Refin'd. For 'tis in him Fame doubly does commend An active Patriot, and a faithful Friend. Then from his near Attendance be remov'd Urbano, tho by all admir'd and lov'd: Tho his sweet Temper and obliging Port, Become his Office, and adorn the Court. He seems by Nature form'd Mankind to please, So Free, so unconstrain'd in his Address, Improv'd by ev'ry Vertue, ev'ry Grace. Senato too, who bravely does deride Sempronia's little Arts, and Female Pride; Whose lofty Look, and whose Majestick Mien Confess the tow'ring God-like Soul within. A Speaker of unparallel'd Renown, Long in the Senate, long in Council known. Ally'd to Celsus by the Noblest Claim, By the same Principles, by Worth the same. Old as he is, still firm his Heart remains, And dauntless his declining Frame sustains. So, pois'd on its own Base, the Center bears The Nodding Fabrick of the Universe. Be these, and such as these, discharg'd from Court, The Better Genii that the Crown support. Then, in their stead, let Mod'rate Statesmen reign, Practise their new pretended Golden Mean. A Notion undefin'd in Virtue's Schools, Unrecommended by her sacred Rules. A Modern Coward Principle, design'd To stifle Justice and unnerve the Mind. A Trick by Knaves contriv'd, impos'd on Fools, But scorn'd by Patriots and exalted Souls: For Mod'rate Statesmen, like Camelions, wear A diff'rent Form in ev'ry diff'rent Air. They stick at nothing to secure their Ends, Caress their Enemies, betray their Friends. Their Medly Temper, their amphibious Mind Is fraught with Principles of every kind; Nor ever can from Stain and Error free, Assert its Native Truth, and Energy. As the four Elements so blended were In their first Chaos, so united there, That since they ne'er could fully be disjoin'd, Each retains something of each other's kind. Nor this is wholly Air, nor that pure Flame, But still in both some Atoms are the same. Let Jano, second of this Trimming Band, Next to Volpone deck'd with Honors stand. Like him for secret Policy renown'd, Like him with all the Gifts of Cunning crown'd. None better can the Jarring Senate guide, Or lure the flying Camp to either side. Of an invet'rate old Fanatick Race, Of canting Parents, sprung this Child of Grace. In show a Tory, but a Whig in Heart; For Saints may safely act the Sinners Part. Once he was ours, and will be ours again, For Art to stifle Nature strives in vain: For ev'ry thing, when from its Center born, Still thither tends, still thither will return. Let him with these Accomplishments supply Hortensio's steddy Faith, and Loyalty. Bruchus, for he has Wealth to buy a Place, Shall wear Urbano's Key, his Post disgrace. A Worthy Son, in whom collected shine The Follies of his mad and Ideot Line. Lord of the woful Countenance, whose Skin Seems sear'd without, and putrify'd within. A Dapper Animal, whose Pigmy size Provokes the Ladies Scorn, and mocks their Eyes. But Balls and Musick are his greatest Care, So willing is the Wretch to please the Fair. 'Tis strange, that Men, what Nature has deny'd, Should make their only Aim, their only Pride. Let Britono, who from the Parent Moon Derives his Welsh Descent directly down, Succeed Senato in his High Command, And bear the Staff of Honour in his Hand. A flutt'ring empty Fop, that ev'ry Night, Sits laughing loud, and jesting in the Pit, Whilst a surrounding Croud of Whores and Bawds, His spritely Converse, and his Wit applauds. An Atlas proper to sustain the Weight Of an incumber'd, and declining State. Let these, as useful Tools, a while possess The Court-Preferments, and indulge their Ease. But they shall fly, like Mists, before the Sun, When my Design's to full Perfection grown, Exert their Power, and make the ruin'd World my own. When thus the Fury had her Scheme display'd, Assenting Hell a low Obeisance paid. Molech, Protector of the Papal Chair, Author of Massacres and Christian War, Was now convinc'd that Sanguinary Laws Could ne'er the Reformation's Growth oppose, Could ne'er in Albion's Church advance his Cause. He therefore urg'd with his old constant Hate, By Mod'rate Means consents to work her Fate. He finds how soon by Toleration's Aid, Her Power is weaken'd, and her Rights betray'd. Nor doubts Occasional Conformity Will by degrees her Essence quite destroy. Then Satan, Prince of the Fanatick Train, Who form'd the Conduct of their glorious Reign, Approv'd the Scheme, not hoping to restore His Subjects to their late unbounded Pow'r. For well he knew their Avarice and Pride Had wean'd the Bankrupt Nation from their side. But these Auspicious Moderation Times, By not detecting, sanctify their Crimes; By baffling Justice, and eluding Law, Make Vice insult, and Sin triumphant grow; Nay, such th'Effects of Moderation are, The Guilty to reward, as well as spare. Hence Foes to Prelacy are clad in Lawn, Hence Rebels are the Fav'rites of the Throne. What could they more desire, than thus to pass The blest Remainder of their happy Days, Fatted with Plunder, and dissolv'd in Ease? Nor Belial, th'Atheist's Patron, could complain, For Moderation would enlarge his Reign, Where all unpunish'd talk, and live profane; Where Irreligion Providence denies, Nor dreads the Laws of Earth, nor Thunder of the Skies. Mammon, the Trader's and the Courtier's God, No sooner heard the Project, but allow'd; For hence his Vot'ries uncontroul'd might live, And endless Frauds commit, and endless Bribes receive. But most Cethego the Design approves, Who dead and living in Mæander's moves. He knew how he deluded hapless James, By the same wily Arts, and subtle Schemes. Proposes then, that he alone be sent, To execute the Fury's New Intent. When he had ended, thus he soon replies: Blest be the Shade, that can so well advise, On thee thy Goddess smiles, on thee relies. Fly, nimbly to thy Native Soil repair, Urge and inforce the well-form'd Counsel there. Occasion favours, the Cabal is met At thy own Mansion, thy belov'd Retreat, The Muses Darling Theme, the Graces Seat. There Clodio's and Sigillo's Anxious Thoughts Are brooding o'er Imaginary Plots. Whilst Bibliopolo with his aukward Jests Deserves his Dinner, and diverts the Guests. Bathilio, in his own unborrow'd Strains, Young Sacharissa's Angel Form profanes: Whilst her dull Husband, sensless of her Charms, Lies lumpish in her soft encircling Arms. For he to Wisdom makes a grave Pretence, But wants, alas! his Father's Depth of Sense. Howe'er supplying all Defects of Wit, He shews a true Fanatick Zeal and Heat. She spoke—the Spectre in a Moment gains Altropia's Balmy Air, the Flow'ry Plains. At his Approach the Dome's Foundation shook, When 'midst their Revels rushing in he broke. Involv'd in Wreaths of Smoak, a while he stood, Seeming at distance an unshapen Cloud. But soon, the Cloud ascending to the Skies, He manifest was seen before their Eyes. Horror and Guilt shook ev'ry Conscious Breast, But Bibliopolo most his Fears exprest, Fainting he tumbled—Pass we o'er the rest. Clodio alone, fix'd and unmov'd appear'd, And what the Phantom said, undaunted heard. Forbear, my Friends, your hot Persuits restrain, Behold your lov'd Cethego once again. From Faction's dark unbottom'd Cell I come, Fraught with Britannia's Fate, and final Doom. For, meditating Vengeance in her Mind, At length a finish'd Plan she has design'd. Nor doubts by mod'rate Methods to obtain, What she by rougher Arts has sought in vain, That Whigs should triumph in a Tory Reign. Thus he began, and then proceeds to tell What Faction had before reveal'd in Hell. Clodio was raptur'd, and in Terms like these, His Joy and Approbation did express. Since thy divided State permits, be thou, As once a Friend, a Guardian Genius now. Give us to execute this grand Design, Thine be the Conduct, and the Glory thine. Attempts that often baffle human Care, By aiding Spirits soon effected are; Their Knowledg in immediate Intuition lies, Nor does, like ours, from long Deductions rise. Pleas'd with this Answer, the retiring Ghost Condens'd the ambient Air, and in a Cloud was lost. Here cease thy Satyr, Muse, and form thy Tongue To louder Numbers, and Heroick Song: Here celebrate, unbyass'd as thou art, The Triumphs of Sempronia's other Part, Nor let her stain the Hero's high Desert. Now the Imperial Eagle hung her Head, Drooping she mourn'd, her wonted Thunder fled. Now was she fitted for a foreign Yoke, Her Scepter nodded, her Dominion shook. Such was the tott'ring State of antient Rome, When conq'ring Hannibal pronounc'd her Doom. When yet the fatal Capua was unknown, That blasted all the Laurels Cannæ won. Where shall she Succour seek? or whither fly? Shall she for ever in Confusion lie? Shall the first Kingdom of the Christian World Be un-reliev'd, in endless Ruin hurl'd? Not so! Her Aid Auspicious Anna brings, Anna the Angel of unhappy Kings. She sends Camillo with an English Force, To stem the Ravaging Invader's Course. France and Bavaria now in vain combine, In vain their Fierce unnumbred Legions joyn. In vain the Thunderbolts of War oppose; Eugenio and Camillo are their Foes. Like Cæsar, both for Stratagems renown'd, Like Alexander, both with Martial Fury crown'd. At length the great decisive Day drew near, On which alone depended all the War. At length the Fight began, the Cannon roar'd, Nor knew the Empire yet her Sov'reign Lord. But soon Camillo with resistless Arms, With double Rage, the Hostile Troops alarms; The Troops that thought no Valor match'd their own, Till English Courage bore them headlong down. Before his conqu'ring Sword they vanquish'd fly, Or in the Field, or in the Danube die. The Danube reeking, ran a Purple Flood, Swell'd and distain'd with Deluges of Blood. O were I Poet equal to my Theme! The future World should wond'ring read this Stream, Where many Thousand Warriors more were slain, Or than on Xanthus Banks, or the Pharsalian Plain: Tho these to all Exploits are far prefer'd, One by the Grecian, one the Roman Bard. Hence is the Empire to it self restor'd, Revolting Nations recognize their Lord. Lewis no more shall Godlike Titles claim, Nor Europe aw'd and trembling dread his Name. Hence a new Scene of Happiness appears, A long Successive Train of Golden Years. So sav'd Demetrius the Athenian State, Oppress'd by Foes, and sunk with adverse Fate. No soonsr was the bloody Battel won, But all his Fame with Adoration own; But on the mighty Victor they bestow'd The sacred Stile and Honours of a God. But tho no Altars we profanely raise, But tho a less, we pay a juster Praise; All but the blind Idolatry intend, Which ridicules the glorious Worth it would commend. When with his Eastern Spoils returning Home, Augustus enter'd his applauding Rome, Virgil and Horace waited on his Fame, Glad to record the Muses Patron's Name; And well could they in-ever living Strains, Describe his Triumphs, and reward his Pains. But modern Heroes, tho as truly brave As those of old, not equal Poets have. No Virgils now, nor Horaces to raise Trophies proportion'd to their deathless Praise. An Addison perhaps, or Tate may write; Volpone pays them for their Venal Wit. But since my Muse, warm'd with a gen'rous Flame, Unbrib'd would eternize Camillo's Name; Let him accept such Homage as she brings, Nor think that wholly uninspir'd she sings. But, Goddess, still one Labor more remains, Still Nereo claims thy Tributary Strains; Tune thy Harmonious Voice to Nereo's Praise, A Subject pregnant with immortal Lays. 'Tis he extends the Heav'nly Anna's Reign High as the Stars, unbounded as the Main. 'Tis he, whose Valour the Batavian Wars Inur'd to Glory from his greener Years. 'Tis he La Hogue's opposing Ord'nance bore, Nor fear'd the Lightning Blasts, nor Thunders roar. 'Tis he with Scipio, Darling of our Isle, From vanquish'd Vigo forc'd the Indian Spoil. 'Tis he the Straits Defence so lately storm'd, A Town by Nature fortify'd and arm'd. 'Tis he, unequal far in Force, o'ercame A Fleet secure of Conquest and of Fame, A Fleet by vast Expence for War prepar'd, At once the Spaniards Terror and their Guard. For what can English Bravery withstand? When Nereo or Camillo do command, It vindicates the Sea and triumphs o'er the Land. 'Tis he Detraction's baleful Breath has born, But with a Noble and Heroick Scorn. For let his Foes this Just Monition have, Envy's the Coward's Homage to the Brave. So Aristides long with Malice strove, Nor could his Vertue win a Factious People's Love. The French King's Lamentation for the Loss of the Occasional Bill, 1705. I think I shall never despair, Tho beaten at Hochstet full sore, Since I have gotten somewhere 130 and 4. Tho Malbro' has ruin'd my Cause, I'll soon that matter restore, For amongst the Makers of Laws I've 130 and 4. The Cub that I've cherish'd so long, In time will pay off his score, For I find his Party is strong, 'Tis 130 and 4. I'll send him home to his Throne, Which his Father abandon'd before, I'm sure he will be maintain'd By the 130 and 4. The Alliance had all been dissolv'd, And I had got all in my Power, Had then the Question been carry'd By the 130 and 4. My Son had been tack'd unto Spain Much faster than ever before, Had the great Design but gone on Of the 130 and 4. But they have put some of my Friends Into Places of Profit and Power, Or else the Question had gone With the 130 and 4. There's H?nd, and H?t, and H?w, And St. J?n, and M?l, and M?re, Have now forsaken their Friends, The 130 and 4. I think my Affairs at Sea Look better than ever before, Some Officers are of the Mind Of the 130 and 4. Some Captains have made me a Present, Of some of their Ships of War, And these are all of a piece With the 130 and 4. I'll fit out an English Fleet, To the Number of half a Score, And these shall all be employ'd For the 130 and 4. Am not I a Politick Prince, Who have ruin'd Mankind with my Power, To have in a Protestant Land 130 and 4? I have had my Cabals in that Nation These 45 Years, and more, And I find I'm not yet out of Fashion With the 130 and 4. With Wenches I doz'd an old Stallion, He Dunkirk resign'd for a Whore, And I play a new Game of Rebellion With the 130 and 4. I govern'd and gull'd Brother Jemmy, He firmly believ'd what I swore, Till they banish'd him hither to see me, From the 130 and 4. I maintain now their dear Prince of Wales, As I did his old Father before, Tho I wish he was gone from Versailles, To his 130 and 4. Now to keep these brave Allies in heart, I'm glad my Friend Tallard's gone o're, I hope he'll again do his Part With the 130 and 4. Tho he sheath'd his Sword with Disgrace, Yet he knows how to draw a Lu'd'Or, And that Weapon shall always have place With the 130 and 4. Anjou must be left in the lurch, (The most Catholick Son of the Whore) Till he's rais'd by such Sons of the Church, As the 130 and 4. When my Troops were sent all a packing, No Plaister so fitted my Sore, As the Brawling and Wrangling and Tacking Of the 130 and 4. The Kings of the Spaniards and Romans, Must be humbled and turn'd out of Doors, If I get but another House of Commons Like the 130 and 4. Nor shall my strong Hopes ever faulter, Tho I'm squeez'd and drain'd very Poor, Till Justice is tack'd with a Halter To the 130 and 4. On the Sea Fight between Sir G. R. and Tolouse, 1704. Who does not extol our Conquest Marine? Courage and Conduct, Rook and Tolouse, 'Twas the sharpest Engagement that ever seen, Courage, &amp;c. An Action so glorious was never yet known, Courage, &amp;c Where no Ship was taken, and no Trophy won, Courage, &amp;c. 'Tis plain that the French by Sir George were out-shot, Courage, &amp;c. They only th'Advantage, we Victory got, Courage, &amp;c. Their Fleet a whole day we did terribly maul, Courage, &amp;c. And pursu'd them two more without Pouder or Ball, Courage, &amp;c. The Flag-man that madly the close Fight began, Courage, &amp;c. Had lost all his Squadron and not sav'd a Man, Courage, &amp;c. Had not the Cool Admiral to Prudence inclin'd, Courage, &amp;c. The distance maintain'd in spight of the Wind, Courage, &amp;c. We conquer'd the French, but had they been beat, Courage, &amp;c. Our Conquest tho glorious had been more compleat, Courage, &amp;c. If our Hero abroad no Laurels has got, Courage, &amp;c. Yet he triumphs at home, and is Victor by Vote, Courage, &amp;c. A Song on the same. [As brave Sir Rooke Thoulouse did beat] As brave Sir Rooke Thoulouse did beat, So brave Thoulouse beat him; But whensoe'er they meet again, George will his Jacquet trim. They both did fight, they both did beat, They both did run away; They both did strive to meet again The quite contrary way. On the Colours in Westminster-Hall, 1704. As Hodge and Dick, who lately came From Lichfield, and from Nottingham, Walk'd up the long litigious Hall, Where Knaves at one another bawl; Quoth Hodg, Adzookers! what are these That hang aloft as thick as Bees? Dick who (besides his Country Tricks) Was hugely vers'd in Politicks, And never miss'd a Market-day To read what Jones and Dyer say, Thus gravely answer'd: Friend, quoth he, I marl at thy Stupidity; If thou had'st read, as I have done, The News that weekly comes to Town, Thou'dst not been ignorant; but now Listen a while and thou shalt know. These on the right are what were took From French-men by the Noble Rooke: Those on the left from Blenheim came, Where Marlborough encreas'd his Fame. For thus, in most of your Addresses, The Matter wonderful express is. They tell you plainly how that we Obtain'd a double Victory, First one at Land, then one at Sea. A Jolly Red-Coat standing by, Cry'd out, You Whoreson that's a Lye; Come up you Dog, and then look back, Here's neither Pendant, Flag nor Jack. With that, an honest Tar steps in, Before a Quarrel could begin, And cry'd, Hold fast Brother, that is true, These Trophies all belong to you. We fought the French indeed, but they Would not be beat, but run away, And so did we another day. We saw their Flags, but could not catch 'em, But Shovel's going now to fetch 'em. They all shook hands but Dick, and he Was plaguily concern'd to see They spoil'd his Noble Rookery. A new Ballad. [1] All the Materials are the same, Of Beauty and Desire; In a fair Woman's goodly Frame, No Brightness is without a Flame, No Flame without a Fire. Then tell me what those Creatures are, Who wou'd be thought both chast and fair? 2 If on her Neck her Hair be spread, With many a curious Ring; That Heat which serves to curl her Head, Will make her mad to be a Bed, And do another Thing. Then tell me, &amp;c. 3 If Modesty it self appears With Blushes in her Face; Think you the Blood that dances there, Can revel it no other where, Or warm no other Place? Then tell me, &amp;c. 4 Ask but of her Philosophy, What gives her Lips the Balm, What makes her Breasts to heave so high, What Spir'ts give motion to her Eye, And moisture to her Palm? Then tell me, &amp;c. 5 Then, Celia, be not coy, for that Betrays thy Self and thee: There's not a Beauty nor a Grace Bedecks thy Body or thy Face, But plead within for me. Then tell me what those Women are, Who wou'd be thought both Chast and Fair. The Down-Cast, 1705. A way with your Ballads, be gon with old Simon, What a Rope can you find so delightful to rhime on? What signify Hundreds, and Thirties, and Fours, When the Bill they have brooded is cast out of doors? I cannot indeed disown their Good Nature, I know they design'd well, but that makes no matter. Had the Bill been japan'd into one that gives Mony, Then the Queen had receiv'd some Gall with her Hony. The Tax must be rais'd with squeezing the Conscience (Some thought this was neither Injustice nor Nonsense) But now I am gravel'd in all my Devices, My Policy's foundred, my Scheme's all in pieces. The Archbishop of Paris, my great Cater-Cousin, Will scarce keep his Fiddle in Tune without Rosin. You know when my Forces make Enemies flee 'em, The Choire and the Cardinal roar a Te Deum. Nay tho I am trounc'd and made to disgorge, Or make a Draw-game on't (as I did with Sir George) Yet all these Defeats I can prudently gild With the Name of a Triumph on the Sea, or the Field. When my Gains are the shortest, my Songs are the longest, The Gazette and Bishop will call it a Conquest. But here's a Miscarriage above all Disguise, To prove this Good News needs a Bushel of Lies. The Crime of Dissenting I strive to inhance, To damn the Indulgence with the Edict of Nants; To bring down the Whigs, and the Men of the Low-Church, I retain'd all the Papists, and the Atheists of No-Church; They that were most famous for swearing and storming, Sustain'd the Dispute against Partial Conforming: The Reasons they for the Bill's Piety bring, Are such as prove me the most Christian King; For this is most easy, when Men set their desire on't, To make a Virtue of Rage, and a Saint of a Tyrant. Don't say that a Church-Persecution looks odly, I've a hundred Divines that say this is godly. It's stuff for to preach up Accord and Allyance With Low-Church and Round-heads, hold 'em all at Defiance. Hang out bloody Flags for the Men that do ever-ill, Live up to the Doctrine of Pious Sacheveril. The Church is a falling, and these Men must prop her, By fixing a Crime on each Interloper. The Commons took care of their Bill, like good Nurses (Tho in that House 'twas plagu'd with Reasons and Curses) But when it went up for their Lordships Concurrence, They read it, and then kick'd it out with Abhorrence. Its Advancement was only like that of those Fellows, Who rise up the Ladder, to hang on the Gallows. It's true, I'ad my Champions in that upper House, Who ventur'd their Credit this Cause to espouse, And had rather be laugh'd at than smother their Fury (These Worthies look fine in my Books I'll assure ye) Great W?sea bully'd the Lords with a huff, And N?m spoke more Rhetorical stuff; My Lord's Grace of Y? shook his Head with the Hair on't, And said, the Religion of this Bill's apparent, (And he was i'th' right on't, for no Church e'er stood More firmly than ours that's cemented with Blood) But the Politick Issues are things that he leaves To such of the Peers as wear no Lawn-Sleeves. My good Lord of L?n, in very odd Fashion, Stood up for to mumble a pithy Oration, But (whether the Duns and the Bailiffs had scar'd him) He mutter'd so low that scarce any one heard him, Tho had he been audible, few would regard him. In the heat of these Arguments learned and able, The Bill was stretch'd out on its Death-bed, the Table. For alas, all these Topicks of Flattery and Error, Were banter'd and martyr'd to my very great Horror. That this brave Contrivance again should miscarry-a, Comes heavily after the Stroak at Bavaria; My Veteran Troops at Hochstet were routed, My Veteran Agents in England are flouted. There's Sommers and Wharton, with others in vogue, And Orford who puts me in mind of La Hogue, With Peterborough, Hallifax, Sarum, and Mohun, In all to the Number of Seventy one; As some of the Commons would have tack'd it, so they First read it, than rack'd it, and packt it away. The Bill was Asthmatick quite thro the Debate, And bloated with Venom, lay waiting its Fate. Sometimes it wou'd redden, and my Agents wou'd smile on't, Till the Vollies of Reason made it faint, and then silent. But the worst of all came when the Question was stated, Then it fetch'd a long Gasp and humbly departed. What I took for a Champion's no more than a Martyr, By pushing it forwards I've but caught a Tartar. Sir S. G's Petition to the good People of Ag?sham. My Petition, good People of A?m, hear, For now my Heart aches, and my Head's full of Care; For I find I have too much Reason to fear That you will not chuse me a Member. My Qualifications I will rehearse, Which I pray you amongst my Electors disperse, And to shew you my Parts I will do it in Verse. I hope you will chuse me a Member. Since a Knighthood I got, and an Alderman's Gown, With these I set up for to bully the Town, Tho some say I'm the arrantest Coxcomb that's known; O therefore pray chuse me a Member. The Marks of my Church you may see in my Face, I've the Wit of a Goose, and the Brains of an Ass, And my Phiz? has been often rubb'd over with Brass; O therefore pray chuse me a Member. I could show you my Love to the Young Prince of Wales, But I am afraid you'l be telling of Tales, By my Actions you see I look to'ard Versailles; O therefore pray chuse me a Member. But Sir Thomas's Work-house afflicts me full sore, Who obliges the Town by employing the Poor; But I and my Lord will destroy't to our Pow'r. O therefore pray chuse us both Members. If a Fool and a Knave you've a mind to obtain, You will find that your labour will not be in vain, If we the Election do happen to gain, By being both chosen your Members. The Lamentation of High-Church, 1704. Thus God does bless our Sovereign Anne, Makes her a glorious Queen, For by her Arms such Feats are done, The like was never seen. She for the Clergy did provide, Which was full well I trow; And now we must be on her side, Whether we will or no. But Moderation is her Text, Which she does so explain, That we shall sorely be perplext How to turn Tale again. For my Lord Duke, and my Lord Sly, Both join in with the Court, And they are lifted up so high They'l make us but their Sport. The Duke the Victory did obtain, Or else h'had got a Tartar; If he had been beaten back again, Perhaps he had been shorter. And now they take the Sons of the Church, And put them into Places, Which makes them leave us in the lurch, Oh! this the very Case is. Our rich and constant M?ll now, Since they a Place have gave him, He votes not as he us'd to do, But just as they would have him. Our Bully-back Jack H?w, alas! Since he is made Pay-Master, What my Lord Sly will have him do, He'l do it in all hast Sir. Young H?d too, that talkt so much To bring the Lords to Trial, He minds not Us, nor Them, nor Church, But minds the Navy-Royal. Our prating Ar?r M?re, whom we Always rely'd on still, For seven hundred Pounds a Year Does vote against the Bill. That Cunning Fox the Speaker too, That us'd to trick and trim, Wherein his Interest is concern'd, The Church may sink or swim. Thus you may see that Sons of Church The Places are prefer'd to; And that the Queen might please us all, Sh'as oblig'd the Sacred Herd too. And yet the Whigs vote for the Queen More heartily than we do; And is not this as sad a thing As any Man can see to? Now the Cause I will explain, Why we do grumble still, We cannot persecute again, Altho we have the Will— We thought when their Dutch King was dead, We should have leave to smite 'em, But now our Hands are so ty'd up, We cannot Gibeonite 'em. And now they say the House of Lords Do's keep 'em all from Ruin, Whilst to bring home our Natural Prince I'th t'other House is brewing. Thus sorrowfully must we sing, Or mournfully may say, Our Queen is so much like Their King, Alack and well-aday. The Royal Gamesters, or the old Cards new shuffled for the Conquering Game. Germany. E're we to play this Match prepare, Let's know, first, who together are. Holland. Let England deal the Cards about, The four Knaves play, the rest stand out. Prussia. France is a Gamester, and must fall, Else Odds will beat the Devil and all. France. What I have won I'll venture still, I will give nothing but the Deal. England. Play fair then, and it is agreed, The two black Knaves against the Red; The Kings shall hold another Sett, And the four Queens shall set the Bett. The Knaves of France and Spain are black, 'Tis Germany must hold the Pack. Germany. Give me the Cards, the Deal is mine, Diamonds are Trumps, Who betts this time? Holland. I'll hold ten Thousand Livers by 'Gainst France and Spain; I'll tell you why, Because the Odds are ten to one, They'l certainly be both undone. Savoy. I'll take you up, with you I'll lay, That France and Spain will hold you play. Denmark. I'll nothing bett on either side; Portugal. Nor I until I see them try'd. Bavaria. I know on which side I would bett, But will not tell my Mind as yet. Sweden. Nor I, but still will Neuter stand, And do them Service underhand. Poland. One single Game with Swedes I'll try, I'll make the smooth-fac'd Youth comply, Venice. Go on, and prosper all, say I. The First Game, 1702. Germany held good Cards, and play'd them well, Got some by Tricks and Honours, and some by Deal. The second Deal France held the Cards, and then The Game seem'd two to one for France &amp; Spain, But in a little time they turn'd again. For Fortune now old Lewis's Side forsakes, England won all, but Holland drew the Stakes. The Second Game, 1703. The Second Game Bavaria took their Parts, And the first Deal turn'd up the King of Hearts, Got the Court Cards and Trumps into his Power, And put the Slip upon the Emperor. And well it was for France he serv'd him so, For Lewis else had quickly been brought low; Germany fretted thus to see it go. England still play'd its Part, and won some Tricks, And fairly brought the Game up Eight, to Six. But Germany had no good Cards to play, And by ill Fortune gave the Game away. Savoy did from France and Spain divide, And ventur'd all on the contrary Side; Loses some Stakes, but England lends him more, And Portugal does for that same declare. The Third Game, 1704. But vex'd to see the Business done by halves, England and Holland took the Cards themselves. Germany laid his last Stake down to play France cut the Cards, and Holland led the way, But all the Stress upon the Dealers lay. The first Deal from the Cards Bavaria lost, And fear'd that now his great Designs are cross'd. Holland deals next, France the first Trick did get, But England by the Honours won the Sett. Bavaria ruin'd threw the Cards away, And had not left another Cross to play. The Fourth Game, 1705. France to the last Stake brought, &amp; Spain the same, But Germany revok'd and spoil'd the Game; Which made the other Gamesters for to swear, He did not play at all upon the Square. England chang'd Sides, and took the Dutch again, Whilst Portugal play single hand with Spain. But after many Deals, and mighty cross Between them both, there little was but lost. Now England deals about for the last Stake, And had a hand that made Great Monsieur quake. But when the Sett to a Conclusion came, Holland lost Dealing, and quite baulk'd the Game. The Conquering Game, 1706. England deals next, and France is fain To lend a losing Stake to Spain. Savoy betts all, France threatens hard To take from him his Leading Card: But England all the rest restore, And tell him they will lend him more. Now on all Sides the Stakes are down, And Spain plays briskly for the Crown: And Portugal some Betts doth lay, Which England does, and Holland pay. The first Deal Spain three Tricks does lose, Which doth old Lewis much confuse. France shuffles next, more Stakes doth bett, And threatens hard to win the Sett, E're Germany his Cards can sort, While Venice laughs and likes the Sport. England says nothing all the while, But plays such Cards makes Holland smile. France wins a Stake or two at first, And Swedes would back them if they durst: But Poland holds him to't as yet, And hopes to gain his last lost Bett. France with his best Court-Cards begins, While Spain lose faster than he wins. The Lot grows warm, brisk Play is shown, And Savoy lays his last Stake down. But Germany with Trumps supply'd, Soon turns the Game on t'other side. France with the Ace of Hearts doth join, But England plays the King and Queen. Old Lewis vex'd, yet looking grave, With speed throws down another Knave, And questions not the Game to save. While Portugal, with Anger then, Plays down another Single Ten: At which the Gamesters seem'd to smile, And stood amaz'd a little while. But when he some Excuse did make, They pass it by as a Mistake. Venice at last for Holland betts, And holds ten thousand Pounds on th'Sett. France offers now to part the Stakes, And Spain the self-same Proffer makes: But England will to neither stand, For all the Honours are in their Hand. France plays a Trump then, for to try In whose Hand all the others lie; Which he soon found unto his Cost; When Spain perceiving all was lost, Throws down the Cards, &amp; gives the Sett for gone, Bavaria takes it up and plays it on: But England trumps about, &amp; so the Game is won. Advice to a Painter, 1701. Painter, I've seen a Picture represent The Five illustrious Gentlemen of Kent: Just such a Piece as that, for size, I'd have, But for each Hero there pourtray a Knave: Each Traytor's Guilt discover in his Face, And let just Art detect their want of Grace. Draw Robin Hood a plotting in a Chair, And Little John well pleas'd to see him there, Brothers in Villany as next in Shire. Place H?t next, and then let F?ch appear; Let Tallard's Gold and Sydney's Blood be there; Then Kit the Trimmer, &amp; when these you've drew, The Merry Andrew of St. Bartholomew Bring in with his Fool's Coat, and close the Shew. But hold—there are a Couple wanting yet, Whose Effigies thou art in England's Debt, Old Ned; and let me see—a Coronet, A Hide-bound Carkass, that deserves no Name, But what of old in French from Dunkirk came; When his vile Sire that Fortress did betray, To those his Son would sell us all away. Now Auro Patriam for their Motto chuse, And say, We have a Right to speak that lose. The Rook. Of old, the very Name of Drake Made the whole Spanish Nation quake. And ev'n of late, an English Rook Scar'd all their Coast, and one Town took. Some say, they were more scar'd than hurt, And will not thank the Black-bird for't: Envying that one of his dark Feather Shou'd guard the Roman Eagle thither; And after that made all the Sail Of Spain and France quite to turn Tail. Tho Whiggish Malice will not say, This Noble Rook's a Bird of Prey; Yet Truth must make all Men allow, That he has been a good Scare-Crow, And left Thoulouse in fearful pain, He'l pluck a Crow with him again. On K. Charles's Voyage to Spain, 1704. Back'd with Confederate Force, the Austrian goes, To find in Spain strong Friends, and feebler Foes. How long has our poor Gazetteer mistook, First made a Monarch, then redubb'd a Duke! Philip was King of Spain two Months ago, And now, the Lord be prais'd, Duke Charles is so. Britannia's Prayer for the Queen, 1706. By Mr. Tate, Poet Laureat to her Majesty. How justly now might I aspire To Mighty Pindar's Force and Fire! When Gods and God-like Kings he did rehearse, And crown'd them with immortal Verse, Worth all their Statutes, by the skilful'st Hand, That only could for short-liv'd Ages stand. But the Possession of the Golden Lyre, Where all the Charms of Harmony conspire, The Muse to Pindar did confine: Pindar alone she does permit In Wit's sublimest Orb to sit, And, like the Sun, without a Rival shine. Zeal therefore shall perform the Muse's Part, And Poetry's Deficiences supply; Zeal, that shall vie with Art, And mount the Song as high. Besides, my Theme, so Charming, so Divine! Without a Muse, shall raise Poetick Fire; A QUEEN, that can, beyond a Muse, inspire, A QUEEN more sacred than the NINE. O best of Sov'reigns! From your lofty Sphere, Vouchsafe your trembling Bard to chear, Vouchsafe your Votary to hear; Who in sincere, tho slender Lays, Attempts the Triumphs of your Praise, And to attempt is all— For what rash Mortal will pretend In Words to comprehend Vertues, where Speech no Aid affords; Graces, beyond the narrow Bounds of Words; Or number Royal Gifts that Number's Pow'r transcend? To You (her Sacred Guardian here) Happy Britannia ever will address, And, with repeated Vows confess, That, in her Sov'reign Sphere, Your Equal never rose, nor shall hereafter rise. The best and greatest Prize That Fate e'er gave, or ever shall bestow; And, yet for ought we Mortals know, Another Golden Season may be seen, A Second Golden Age, but never such a QUEEN: A QUEEN! Whom all United Vertues crown, That, singly, gave her Ancestors Renown: She does their precious Ore ingross, Without the least Remains of Dross, So Sublimated, so Refin'd, That now Those Sons of Light, So glorious in their Night, Languish like Stars by the Sun's Beams out-shin'd. Amidst these Triumphs of her State, Advanc'd to such a dang'rous Height, And jealous of her future Fate, Posterity is now BRITANNIA's Care; For them she prays—What therefore is her Pray'r? Not for Increase of Wealth, more Blenheim-Spoils; More Trophies of her Hero's Toils, To hear her Naval Thunder roar, Alarming all th'Atlantick Shoar; Great ANNA there new Garlands win; New Conquests there begin, Where Hercules gave o'er. Successfully for these she has addrest, But sums her Wishes now in One Request, And does for that with utmost Ardour call, The mighty Blessing that includes them All. That such a Princess, so belov'd By Heaven, by Britain, and by All approv'd, Whom every Nation wish their own, To bless her People long may long possess her Throne. Long may my Queen survive to be By Justice, Prudence, Constancy, The True Vicegerent of the Deity; To cherish Peace, support Allies, And Haughty Tyrants to chastise, The Griefs of Europe to redress; The Universal Patroness. Live ANNA! for the Publick Welfare Live; And live to share the Blessings that you give; In your Protection safe our Law remains, Sweet Liberty, with You, her antient Rights regains, With you Religion's crown'd, with you Religion reigns. Then, since assur'd, whene'er You go, Of everlasting Welcome there, May your Return to Native Skies be slow; This is the Gen'ral Pray'r. While You remain, our World is blest; When You remove—I leave the rest To be in Sighs Exprest. The Miseries of England, from the Growing Power of her Domestick Enemies, 1701. Albion, disclose thy drousy Eyes, and see The Bondage that surrounds thy Liberty; Put on thy mourning Weeds, prepare to groan Beneath that Fate thy Foes are hurry'ng on: Thou hast not only those Abroad to fear, But worse at Home that Favour's Badges wear; Who fond of Honours lurk beneath the Throne, And sacrifice thy Welfare to their own: They envy Monarchy, thy Church they hate, And are but flatt'ring Sycophants of State; Who widen Discords, and Dissensions breed, Yet are, by Querks, from common Justice freed; Upheld by Brethren partial to their Cause, T'abuse the Kingdom, and defy the Laws; Rais'd for some secret Services in State, From narrow Fortunes to be vastly Great. These for new Wars may well express their hast, Who throve so strangely in the fruitless last, And Mercenary-like delight in Broils, To fill their Coffers with the Kingdom's Spoils. So those that live on Wrecks calm Weather hate, Because they gain most when the Storm is great. Nations in trouble, like to Ships distress'd, Often by those that help them are oppress'd. Statesmen, like Salvages, the Publick save, And for small Service great Rewards will have. Those who with Hands unbrib'd, and Hearts sincere, 'Twixt Prince and People in a Medium steer, Preserve that Ballance which supports the State, And makes the People Safe, and Monarch Great. Such worthy Patriots merit our Esteem, And shine like Jems about the Diadem, Enjoying what they equally approve, Their Prince's Favor, and their Country's Love. But those aspiring Minions, who extend Their Master's Pow'r, to serve their own by-End, Beyond those Fences which the Laws have made, That neither Part should t'other's Rights invade; Confound that Concord in the Soul of Pow'r, That makes the Whole harmoniously secure; Filling each Subject's Heart with Discontent, Weakning the pow'rful Frame of Government, By straining all its Springs beyond their due extent. So th'active Man, too prodigal of Strength, Exerts his strenuous Sinews, till at length, Aiming to show some wonderful Exploit, Amazing to the fond Spectator's sight, He breaks in the attempt some Nerve within, And lamely leaves unfinish'd his Design; Thus strains himself beyond just Nature's Laws, And gains Contempt instead of vain Applause. So fare ambitious Ministers of State, Who stretch their Power to be unjustly Great. Some from Obscurity start up on high, And are made Great for none knows what, or why. To ill Compliance brib'd with golden Baits, Glean from the Publick Treasure large Estates; And for dark Stratagems perform'd by stealth, Glut their base Av'rice with the Nation's Wealth. These are reserv'd to pacify the Rage Of injur'd People in a prying Age; And must, when sullen Times require, atone For other's Ills as tamely as their own, And with their Sanative Destruction heal The painful Wounds the angry Publick feel. Others born Great, more wary, and more wise, Bulky in Wealth, and subtle in Advice, Run with the Crown for Honor and for Gold, But yet for Safety with their Country hold: Betwixt them both their own By-ends persue, By both much trusted, but to neither true; From Post to Post they unsuspected slide, And in one Station never long reside; But in due Season, to oblige the State, Make way for Favorites of a later Date. Some forward Tools, who hasty to aspire, Will yield to all their Monarch can desire; And for unlawful Deeds obscurely done, Are quickly rais'd and oft despis'd as soon: Whilst those more cunning shift from Place to Place, And still steer clear of Danger and Disgrace; Yet glean and plunder safely as they move, And raise their Minions thro Design not Love; Who stand as Skreens that interrupt the Light, To hide their Patrons Ills from human sight; Labouring where e'er they come to bellow forth My Lord's great Honour, Honesty and Worth; What mighty things for th'Publick he has done, What Universal Love his Deeds have won: Whilst those that try my worthy Patriot find, He's Courtier true, all Words, and those but Wind. Such Lords as these the hoodwink'd Nation fleece, As if the People were their Sheep or Geese, And they the Foxes that the Flocks betray, Making th'unthinking Innocents their Prey. These are the Men the Common-wealth abuse, Plunder its Treasure, and their Power misuse; To private Ends pervert their Publick Trust, And for base Bribes submit to things unjust. By their vast Fortunes we are Debtors made, Of Sums too mighty to be nam'd or paid; Whose growing Int'rest does so fast accrue, The Nation scarce can raise it when its due. By what strange Measures must we then prepare, New Sinews for a fresh more vig'rous War; Since Debts we owe are too profusely large, Without the People's Murmurs to discharge? Besides, if we project no wiser ways T'apply and husband what the Publick raise, How should old Debts be otherwise than due, Since ev'ry Tax we raise begets a New? What Man, who with the Eye of Reason sees, Can justify Enormities like these? Or what blind partial Ideot can plead, That such Misconducts no Inspection need? What Tool, but he who does his Country hate, Would labour such Faults to extenuate; Or strenuously oppose what's clear as Light, To make such dark Intrigues of State look white? What close clandestine Service can atone For Ills like these to the whole Publick done? Or who but Guilty Favorites make Delays Of common Justice by uncommon Ways; Whose very Friends their Crimes with Horror see, Thro the dim Glass of Partiality: Tho pleas'd and proud their Leaders are so great, And busy Actors on the stage of State, Yet the whole Faction some Concern must feel, To see full Sharers play their Parts so ill; Having no more in their Behalf to say, But only plead th'Advantage of Delay, Believing they have manag'd Things awry, And done what Justice cannot justify; Objecting, that alone the great Affair, Relating to the new Impending War, Does at this Juncture just Precedence claim, And ought to be the Senate's only Aim; Whilst such small Trifles unredrest should ly, Or be at least defer'd till by and by, And all such petty Faults neglected be, Till some more proper Opportunity. Wholesom Advice, and wisely urg'd by those, Who side for Interest with Domestick Foes, And frightning us with Foreign Ills to come, Wound fain encourage those we find at home. Shame on Forbearance! shall the Commonweal Endure with Patience, Mischiefs that they feel, And arm against those Ills we only fear, Neglecting present Wrongs the Publick bear? If Men in Trust shall sink the Nation's Aid, And common Justice by a Trick evade: If such a Latitude as this we give, How can our Arms succeed, or Nation thrive? What is't that made our Funds deficient prove, And caus'd those Debts we cannot yet remove? What is't of late prevented our Success, And made France greater and old England less? Why is the payment of the Fleet delay'd, And why the Transport-Service yet unpay'd? Why is the Army in such large Arrears, That serv'd us in the late succesless Wars? Who rais'd Estates miraculously soon, And left these National Concerns undone? Why not those Persons from their Posts remov'd, By the last Senate blam'd, and disapprov'd? And why not, if known guilty of a Fault, Without delay to common Justice brought? Neglect of such Misguidance in the State, Brought Rome to Ruin which was once so great; Her publick Treasure being misapply'd, Forc'd her to stoop to those she once defy'd. If such Abuses are excus'd so long, Till Common Practice justifies the Wrong; That careless Nation does it self betray, Laying a Ground-work for its own Decay; And like the Pellican expends its Blood, To fledg a greedy, worthless, callow Brood. Yet from some partial Penman have we heard, Errors so small deserve not our Regard; Or else that we such Trifles should defer, To be the last dull Siftings of our Care. In the late Wars they cannot but allow, That France was nothing near so strong as now; The fatal Union which so much we dread, Tho long ago foreseen, was then unmade: And wealthy England, when the War began, More rich in Coin, and numerous in Men, With Voice united cry'd, To Arms, To Arms, And every Pulse beat nothing but Alarms. The People's Hearts and Purses open lay, Some fond to fight and others free to pay; The forward Rabble needed no Decoy, But freely enter'd, and embark'd with Joy. Each tipling Hero o'er his Belch would swear, He'd have a Vineyard of his own next Year; And doubted not but so far to advance, That in a Cup of Soldier's Cordial Nants, He'd drink to England in the midst of France. Strong foresight of Success the Nation fed, And mighty hopes the Common People led; The Kingdom rich, and ev'ry Native free To hazard all to curb French Tyranny. Thus wanting neither Mony, Men nor Will, The faithless French to conquer, or to kill; But all things made a kind auspicious show, And look'd more fortunate by much than now: Threat'ning our miscall'd cow'rdly Enemy, With sad Destruction both by Land and Sea. What then obstructed the Designs we laid, That our great Hopes no better Issue had? What hinder'd us we humbl'd not our Foes, Nor then effected what we now propose? When the whole Kingdom richer was by far, And ev'ry Genius well inclin'd to War. What then obstructed our desir'd Success, But some Misconducts we may now redress? What made our long expensive Wars prove vain, And leave us worse than if they'd ne'er began? What made us give the Gallick Tyrant Breath, To gain his Ends by Ferdinando's Death? Thus by a Peace mis-tim'd we sooth'd our Fate, And made th'aspiring Foe just twice as Great. What made our Taxes, tho profusely large, Always too slender to support the Charge? Such worthless Numbers gleaning from our Funds Private Rewards, the Publick Int'rest wounds. Some climb to Posts of Profit misbestow'd, And, hasty to be Great, grow rich by Fraud: Others by begging private Boons and Grants, Swallow what should relieve the Nation's Wants. Thus from small Merits make a wondrous Rise, And become huge State-Monsters in a trice: Hatch'd up and fledg'd beneath a bounteous Throne, From callow Wrens to mighty Eagles grown: Having no Herald their Deserts to prove, But the large Badges of Imperial Love. Such Men as these the Nation's Wealth ingross, Gaining vast Riches by the Kingdom's Loss. And shall we now a War like Madmen make, With these Domestick Dangers at our Back? Shall mercenary Tools in Trust remain, To cheat the Kingdom o'er and o'er again? Must we run headlong to a dubious War, To make rich Minions, and our Country poor? And ne'er look back on those Enormities That caus'd our Debts, and our Deficiencies? Which did our Arms obstruct, our Measures break, When we were stronger, and our Foes more weak? Pray, What Success can we in War expect, If we those Ills as frivolous reject, Which stain'd our Conduct, &amp; our Arms disgrac'd, By rend'ring us succesless in the last? One Cause of these did our late Ends prevent, Our Foes great Strength, or our Mismanagement: If our Misconduct, we should then take care To mend our Faults before we make the War; Remove those selfish mercenary Props That stop'd our Speed, and mar'd our mighty Hopes. Or when our Swords shall for the Laurel strive, What Prospect can unbiass'd Reason give, That England with her Arms shall now do more, And finish what she left undone before? No, we must first those Obstacles remove, That made our late long Contest fruitless prove. If our Foes Strength superior was to ours, And stem'd the Force of our United Pow'rs; And we too feeble for our great Design, When we abounded most in Men and Coin; And France, as 'tis believ'd, now stronger grown, By its late Union with the Spanish Throne: 'Tis then high time our Fury should abate, For no Success on our Attempts can wait, Except kind Providence proves our Confederate. The Coffee-Politician, grave and wise, To this objects, and warmly thus replys: What if the French by Spain are stronger made, We're still superior by the German Aid! And if but England, with a gen'rous Heart, Would at one push her utmost Strength exert, We might o'er France be Conquerors with ease, And make the Tyrant truckle as we please. But should the Nation this Advice receive, And yield the utmost she at once could give, Yet not accomplish what we now project, And humble France so soon as we expect, But further Strength, and more Supplies shall need, Than we can raise t'effect the Glorious Deed; What Mis'ries must our vain Attempts attend, If Fortune crown not with Success the End? Into what Slav'ry must the Nation fall, If to no purpose we should spend our All? Contempt and Poverty we then should find, Instead of Spoils and Trophies we design'd. Then our long Contest for a time must cease, And fruitless end in an Inglorious Peace. Who first want Mony, first must sheath their Swords, For War no Forma Pauperis affords: Therefore let's think of Means, e'er we proceed To raise Supplies so great a War must need. One pow'rful Party has declar'd for Arms, And ev'ry Factious Pamphlet sounds Alarms: But above all, they show the greatest hast, Who by foul Dealings prosper'd in the last, And would involve us headlong in a War, To thrive by Crimes which yet unpunish'd are; Who furnish'd France in the late Wars with Lead For Ball, to knock our Army on the head: Thus rais'd vast Riches by such Ills as these, And dealt, unpunish'd, with our Enemies. These are the Wolves who so impatient are, And such a hideous howling keep for War; Stretching their noisy Throats where e'er they run, Crying Arm, Arm, or England thou'rt undone. Thus a Necessity they strongly plead, To break that Peace so lately we agreed; Which if delay'd had strengthen'd our Allies, Show'd France less Pow'rful, &amp; our selves more Wise. By Arms prevented what without prevail'd, And stop'd that War for Ages now intail'd. Europe has long her Observation made, Of what Designs her prosp'rous Foe has laid: Our present State might eas'ly be foreseen, And by right Measures might have hindred been. The fatal Union should have prov'd but weak, Which now requires a vigorous War to break. But since our Foes to such a height are grown, From our Neglect, or Conduct of their own; No matter which or whether made thus great, By Chance, Industry, or Decree of Fate: Yet from the Danger of their Pride and Pow'r We're farthest off, and stand the most secure; And therefore should be careful how we run Rashly to meet those Mischiefs we may shun; But with due Patience and Discretion wait Till our Rich Neighbours, more expos'd to Fate, Shall crave our Aid, to free them from their Fears, On the same Terms they lately gave us theirs. We were the Suff'rers, they Advantage made, And little less than all the Charge we paid, Besides a liberal Present for their useless Aid. Which in their Bank, Rich as an Indian Mine, Lies bag'd and bury'd close in English Coin. England be wise, and make thy self amends, Return the costly Favours of thy Friends; Let now thy Justice to thy Self be seen, And be as kind as they to Us have been; Neither be aw'd, or yet by Flatt'ries drawn, Tho our Foes threaten, and our Neighbours fawn, To call a distant Evil on our Heads, And take upon our selves what Holland dreads: But make the Charge, e'er we the War begin, Just equal to the Danger we are in; And if assist our Friends with further Aid, To be allow'd, and that Expence repay'd. For why should we, that have least Cause to fear, Defend a Neighbour whom the Danger's near; And we endure the Toil, and pay the Cost, When they, without our Help, must needs be lost? First pay our Debts, and we shall see how far We're able to maintain a vig'rous War, And ev'ry fatal Obstacle remove, That made our Taxes so deficient prove; Or we shall toil beneath a tiresom Weight, And but with half our English Courage fight, Like Tinkers Dogs, with Budgets on their Backs, Or Carriers Horses laden with their Packs. Oppressions unforeseen we soon shall feel, And with hard Dealers we shall hardly deal: Weary of War repent our lavish'd Pounds, And court Balsamick Peace to heal our Wounds. But since such Motives of a speedy War, On every side engagingly appear, That as our fierce impatient Heroes say, Both Shame and Danger must attend Delay; Our forward Nation no Expence must grudg, To save our wiser kind Allies the Dutch; And next revenge the great Dishonour done By the French Tyrant to the English Throne: Therefore, good People, since for cause well known, England's sharp Sword a second time is drawn, 'Tis dangerous now to dote upon your Coin, Your love of Wealth may baulk the great Design. Millions are Sinews that exert the Sword, Therefore Supplies without regret afford; Bullet in War is grown a Modern Cheat, Silver, not Lead, must do the mighty Feat, Mony must bless our Arms, and our Success compleat. Therefore your Aid most willingly impart, And draw your Pursestrings with a gen'rous Heart. What you're assess'd with chearful Spirits give, Good Will makes every thing the better thrive. Besides, consider, tho the Tax runs high, Just at this Juncture for a large Supply; War cannot always last, 'twill one day cease, And if not end in Conquest, 'twill in Peace; And Peace alone in ev'ry good Man's Sense, Is held a Blessing worth a War's Expence. What Niggard then can at a War repine, Carr'd on with such a peaceable Design? Besides, what Albumazar can foresee, What the blest Issue of our Arms may be? Who knows but we may force aspiring France To low'r the Prizes of her Cordial Nants, And cause French Claret to become less dear In England, than our home-brew'd Ale and Beer? For certain ev'ry Englishman 'twould please, To see our Quarrels end in such a Peace, That would produce at last such glorious Days as these. The Rape of Lucrece. Written by Mr. William Shakespeare, and dedicated to the Right Honourable the Earl of Southampton. The Argument. Lucius Tarquinius (for his excessive Pride surnam'd Superbus) after he had caus'd his own Father-in-Law Servius Tullius to be cruelly murder'd, and contrary to the Roman Laws and Customs, not requiring or staying for the People's Suffrages, had possessed himself of the Kingdom; went accompany'd with his Sons and other Noblemen of Rome to besiege Ardea: during which Siege, the principal Men of the Army meeting one Evening at the Tent of Sextus Tarquinius the King's Son, in their Discourses after Supper, every one commended the Vertues of his own Wife; among whom Colatinus extol'd the incomparable Chastity of his Wife Lucrece. In that pleasant Humor they all posted to Rome, and intending by their secret and sudden Arrival, to make trial of that which every one had before avouch'd, only Colatinus finds his Wife (tho it were late in the Night) spinning amongst her Maids, the other Ladies were found all dancing and revelling, or in several Disports. Whereupon the Noblemen yielded Colatinus the Victory, and his Wife the Fame. At that time Sextus Tarquinius being inflam'd with Lucrece's Beauty; yet smothering his Passions for the present, departed with the rest back to the Camp, from whence he shortly after privily withdrew himself, and was (according to his state) royally entertain'd and lodg'd by Lucrece at Colatium. The same night, he treacherously stealeth into her Chamber, violently ravish'd her, and early in the Morning speedeth away. Lucrece in this lamentable plight, hastily dispatcheth Messengers, one to Rome for her Father, another to the Camp for Colatine. They came, the one accompanied with Junius Brutus, the other with Publius Valerius: and finding Lucrece attir'd in Mourning Habit, demanded the Cause of her Sorrow. She first taking an Oath of them for her Revenge, reveal'd the Actor, and whole Matter of his Dealing, and withall suddenly stabb'd her self. Which done, with one Consent, they all vow'd to root out the whole hated Family of the Tarquins: and bearing the dead Body to Rome, Brutus acquainted the People with the Doer and Manner of the vile Deed, with a bitter Invective against the Tyranny of the King; wherewith the People were so mov'd with one Consent, and a general Acclamation, that the Tarquins were all exil'd, and the State-Government chang'd from Kings to Consuls. I. The praising of Lucrece as chast, vertuous and beautiful, maketh Tarquin enamor'd. From the besieg'd Ardea all in post, Born by the trustless Wings of false desire, Lust-breathed Tarquin leaves the Roman Host, And to Colatium bears the lightless Fire, Which in pale Embers hid, lurks to aspire, And girdle with imbracing Flames the Wast Of Colatine's fair Love, Lucrece the chast. Haply that Name of Chast, unhaply set This bateless Edg on his keen appetite: When Colatine unwisely did not let To praise the clear unmatched Red and White, Which triumph'd in that Sky of his Delight, Where mortal Star, as bright as Heaven's Beauties, With pure Aspects did him peculiar Duties. For he the Night before in Tarquin's Tent, Unlock'd the Treasure of his happy state: What Prizeless Wealth the Heavens had him lent, In the Possession of his Beauteous Mate; Reckoning his Fortune at so high a rate, That Kings might be espoused to more Fame, But King nor Prince to such a peerless Dame. O Happiness enjoy'd but of a few, And if possest, as soon decay'd and done! As if the Morning's silver melting dew, Against the golden Splendor of the Sun, A date expir'd, and cancel'd e'er begun. Honour and Beauty in the Owner's Arms, Are weakly fortrest from a World of Harms. Beauty it self, doth of it self persuade The Eyes of Men without an Orator; What needed then Apologies be made To set forth that which is so singular? Or why is Colatine the Publisher Of that rich Jewel he should keep unknown From thievish Cares because it is his own? Perchance his boast of Lucrece Sov'reignty, Suggested this proud Issue of a King; For by our Ears our Hearts oft tainted be: Perchance that Envy of so rich a thing Braving compare, disdainfully did sting His high pitcht Thoughts, that meaner Men should vant The Golden Hap which their Superiors want. But some untimely Thought did instigate His all too timeless speed; if none of those, His Honor, his Affairs, his Friends, his State, Neglected all; with swift Intent he goes To quench the Coal which in his Liver glows. O rash false Heat, wrapt in repentant cold! Thy hasty Spring still blasts, and ne'er grows old. 2. Tarquin welcom'd by Lucrece. When at Colatia this false Lord arriv'd, Well was he welcom'd by the Roman Dame, Within whose Face Beauty and Vertue striv'd, Which of them both should underprop her Fame: When Vertue brag'd, Beauty would blush for shame; When Beauty boasted blushes, in despight Vertue would stain that o'er with Silver white. But Beauty in that White intituled, From Venus Doves doth challenge that fair Field; Then Vertue claims from Beauty Beauty's Red, Which Vertue gave the Golden Age to guild Her Silver Cheeks, and call'd it then their Shield; Teaching them thus to use it in the Fight, When Shame assail'd, the Red should fence the White. This Heraldry in Lucrece Face was seen, Argu'd by Beauties red and Vertues white, Of either's Color was the other Queen; Proving from World's Minority their Right, Yet their Ambition makes them still to fight: The Sov'reignty of either being so great, That oft they interchange each other's Seat. This silent War of Lillies and of Roses, Which Tarquin view'd in her fair Face's Field, In their pure Ranks his Traitor Eye incloses; Where lest between them both it should be kill'd, The Coward Captive vanquished doth yield To those two Armies that would let him go, Rather than triumph in so false a Foe. Now thinks he that her Husband's shallow Tongue, The niggard Prodigal that prais'd her so, In that high Task hath done her Beauty wrong, Which far exceeds his barren Skill to show. Therefore that Praise which Colatine doth owe, Inchanted Tarquin answers with Surmise, In silent Wonder of still gazing Eyes. This earthly Saint adored by this Devil, Little suspected the false Worshipper; ‘For Thoughts unstain'd do seldom dream on Evil, ‘Birds never limb'd, no secret Bushes fear: So guiltless she securely gives good Chear, And reverend Welcome to her Princely Guest, Whose inward Ile no outward Harm exprest. For that he color'd with his high Estate, Hiding base Sin in pleats of Majesty: That nothing in him seem'd inordinate, Save sometime too much Wonder of his Eye, Which having all, all could not satisfy; But poorly rich so wanteth in his store, That cloy'd with much, he pineth still for more. But she that never cop'd with stranger Eyes, Could pick no meaning from their parling Looks, Nor read the subtle shining Secrecies Writ in the Glassy Margents of such Books: She touch'd no unknown Baits, nor fear'd no Hooks, Nor could she moralize his wanton sight, More than his Eyes were open'd to the light. He stories to her Ears her Husband's Fame, Won in the Fields of fruitful Italy; And decks with Praises Colatine's high Name, Made glorious by his manly Chivalry, With bruised Arms and Wreaths of Victory; Her Joy with heav'd-up hand she doth express. And wordless so greets Heav'n for his Success. Far from the purpose of his coming thither, He makes Excuses for his being there; No cloudy show of stormy blustring Weather Doth yet in his fair Welkin once appear, Till sable Night, sad source of Dread and Fear, Upom the World dim Darkness doth display, And in her vaulty Prison shuts the Day. For then is Tarquin brought unto his Bed, Intending Weariness with heavy Sprite: For after Supper long he questioned With modest Lucrece, and wore out the Night: Now leaden Slumber with Life's strength doth fight, And every one to rest themselves betake, Save Thieves, and Cares, and troubled Minds that wake. As one of which, doth Tarquin lie revolving The sundry Dangers of his Will's obtaining, Yet ever to obtain his Will resolving. Tho weak-built Hopes persuade him to abstaining, Despair to gain doth traffick oft for gaining; And when great Treasure is the Meed proposed, Tho Death be adjunct, there's no Death suppos'd. Those that much covet are with gain so fond, That oft they have not that which they possess; They scatter and unloose it from their Bond, And so by hoping more they have but less; Or gaining more, the Profit of Excess Is but to surfeit, and such Griefs sustain, That they prove bankrupt in this poor rich Gain. The aim of all, is but to nurse the Life With Honor, Wealth and Ease, in waining Age: And in this aim there is such thwarting strife, That one for all, or all for one we gage: As Life for Honor, in fell Battels rage, Honor for Wealth, and oft that Wealth doth cost The Death of all, and altogether lost. So that in venturing all, we leave to be The things we are, for that which we expect: And this ambitious foul Infirmity, In having much, torments us with defect Of that we have: so then we do neglect The thing we have, and all for want of VVit, Make something nothing, by augmenting it. Such hazard now must doting Tarquin make, Pawning his Honor to obtain his Lust: And for himself, himself he must forsake. Then where is Truth, if there be no self-Trust? When shall he think to find a Stranger just, When he himself himself confounds, betrays To slandrous Tongues the wretched hateful Lays? Now stole upon the time the dead of Night, When heavy sleep had clos'd up mortal Eye; No comfortable Star did lend his light, No noise but Owls and Wolves death-boding cries: Now serves the Season that they may surprize The silly Lambs, pure Thoughts are dead and still: Whilst Lust and Marder wakes to stain and kill. 3. Tarquin disputing the matter, at last resolves to satisfy his Lust. And now this lustful Lord leapt from his Bed, Throwing his Mantle rudely o'er his Arm, Is madly tost between Desire and Dread; Th'one sweetly flatters, the other feareth Harm: But honest Fear, bewitch'd with Lust's foul Charm, Doth too too oft betake him to retire, Beaten away by brainsick rude Desire. His Fauchion on a flint be softly smiteth, That from the cold stone sparks of Fire do fly, Whereat a waxen Torch forthwith he lighteth, Which must be Load-star to his lustful Eye: And to the flame thus speaks advisedly; ‘As from this cold flint I enforc'd this Fire, ‘So Lucrece must I force to my desire. Here pale with Fear, he doth premeditate The Dangers of his loathsom Enterprise: And in his inward Mind he doth debate, What following Sorrow may on this arise: Then looking scornfully he doth despise His naked Armor of still slaughter'd Lust, And justly thus controuls his Thoughts unjust. Fair Torch burn out thy Light, and lend it not To darken her whose Light excelleth thine: And die unhallow'd Thoughts before you blot With your uncleanness that which is Divine: Offer pure Incense to so pure a Shrine: Let fair Humanity abhor the Deed, That spots and stains Love's modest snow-white Weed. O shame to Knighthood, and to shining Arms! O foul Dishonour to my Houshold's Grave! O impious Act including all foul Harms, A martial Man to be soft Fancy's slave! True Valor still a true Respect should have: Then my Digression is so vile, so base, That it will live engraven in my Face. Yes, tho I die the Scandal will survive, And be an Eye-sore in my Golden Coat: Some loathsom Dash the Herald will contrive, To cipher me how fondly I did dote: That my Posterity sham'd with the Note Shall curse my Bones, and hold it for no Sin, To wish that I their Father had not been. What win I if I gain the thing I seek? A Dream, a Breath, a Froth of fleeting Joy, Who buys a Minute's Mirth to wail a Week? Or sells Eternity to get a Toy? For one sweet Grape who will the Vine destroy? Or what fond Beggar, but to touch the Crown, Would with the Scepter strait be strucken down? If Colatinus dream of my Intent, Will he not wake, and in a desperate rage Post hither, this vile purpose to prevent? This Siege that hath ingirt his Marriage, This Blur to Youth, this Sorrow to the Sage, This dying Vertue, this surviving Shame, Whose Crime will bear an ever-during Blame. O what Excuse can my Invention make, When thou shalt charge me with so black a Deed! Will not my Tongue be mute, my frail Joints shake? Mine Eyes forgo their light, my false Heart bleed? The Guilt being great, the Fear doth still exceed, And extreme Fear can neither fight nor flie, But Coward like with trembling Terror die. Had Colatinus kill'd my Son or Sire, Or lain in Ambush to betray my Life; Or were he not my dear Friend, this Desire Might have excuse to work upon his Wife As in Revenge or Quital of such strife: But as he is my Kinsman, my dear Friend, The Shame and Fault finds no Excuse nor End. Shameful it is, if once the Fact be known; Hateful it is, there is no Hate in loving; I'll beg her Love, but she is not her own: The worst is but denial, and reproving. My Will is strong, past Reasons weak removing. Who fears a Sentence or an old Man's Sawe, Shall by a painted Cloth be kept in awe. Thus (graceless) holds he Disputation, 'Tween frozen Conscience and hot-burning Will, And with good Thoughts makes Dispensation, Urging the worser Sense for Vantage still, Which in a moment doth confound and kill All pure Effects, and doth so far proceed, That what is vile shews like a vertuous Deed. Quoth he, she took me kindly by the Hand, And gaz'd for Tidings in my eager Eyes, Fearing some bad News from the warlike Band Where her beloved Colatinus lies. O how her Fear did make her Colour rise! First red as Roses that on Lawn we lay, Then white as Lawn the Roses took away. And now her Hand in my Hand being lockt, Forc'd it to tremble with her Loyal Fear: Which strook her sad, and then it faster rockt, Until her Husband's Welfare she did hear, Whereat she smiled with so sweet a Chear, That had Narcissus seen her as she stood, Self-love had never drown'd him in the Flood. Why hunt I then for Colour or Excuses? All Orators are dumb, when Beauty pleads; Poor Wretches have remorse in poor Abuses, Love thrives not in the Heart that shadows dreads; Affection is my Captain, and he leads: And when this gaudy Banner is display'd, The Coward fights, and will not be dismay'd. Then childish Fear avant, debating die, Respect and Reason wait on wrinkled Age: My Heart shall never countermand mine Eye, Sad Pause and deep Regard beseems the Sage; My Part is Youth, and beats these from the Stage, Desire my Pilot is, Beauty my Prize, Then who fears sinking where such Treasure lies? As Corn o'er-grown by Weeds, so heedful Fear Is almost cloak'd by unresisted Lust; Away he steals with open list'ning Ear, Full of foul Hope, and full of fond Mistrust: Both which as Servitors to the unjust, So cross him with their opposite Persuasion, That now he vows a League, and now Invasion. Within his Thought her heavenly Image sits, And in the self-same Seat sits Colatine: That Eye which looks on her, confounds his Wits; That Eye which him beholds, as more Divine, Unto a view so false will not incline: But with a pure Appeal seeks to the Heart, Which once corrupted takes the worser part. And therein heartens up his servile Powers, Who flatter'd by their Leaders jocund show, Stuff up his Lust, as Minutes fill up Hours. And as their Captain so their Pride doth grow, Paying more slavish Tribute than they owe. By reprobate Desire thus madly led, The Roman Lord doth march to Lucrece Bed. The Locks between her Chamber and his Will, Each one by him enforc'd, recites his Ward; But as they open, they all rate his Ill, Which drives the creeping Thief to some regard. The Threshold grates the Door to have him heard, Night-wandring Weezels shreek to see him there, They fright him, yet he still pursues his Fear. As each unwilling Portal yields him way, Thro little Vents and Crannies of the Place, The Wind wars with his Torch to make him stay, And blows the Smoke of it into his Face, Extinguishing his Conduct in this Case. But his hot Heart, which fond Desire doth scorch, Puffs forth another Wind that fires the Torch. And being lighted by the Light, he spies Lucrecia's Glove, wherein the Needle sticks; He takes it from the Rushes where it lies, And griping it, the Needle his Finger pricks: As who should say, this Glove to wanton Tricks Is not inur'd; return again in hast, Thou seest our Mistress Ornaments are chast. But all these poor Forbiddings could not stay him, He in the worst Sense construes their Denial; The Doors, the Wind, the Glove that did delay him, He takes for accidental Things of Trial, Or as those Bars which stop the hourly Dial; Who with a ling'ring stay his Course doth let, Till every Minute pays the Hour his Debt. So, so, quoth he, these Lets attend the Time, Like little Frosts that sometime threat the Spring, To add a more rejoycing to the Prime, And give the sneaped Birds more cause to sing. Pain pays the Income of each precious thing; Huge Rocks, high Winds, strong Pirats, Shelves and Sands, The Merchant fears, e're rich at home he lands. Now is he come unto the Chamber Door, That shuts him from the Heaven of his Thought, Which with a yielding Latch, and with no more, Hath bar'd him from the blessed thing he sought. So from himself Impiety hath wrought, That for his Prey to pray he doth begin, As if the Heavens should countenance his Sin. But in the midst of his unfruitful Prayer, Having sollicited th'Eternal Power, That his soul Thoughts might compass his fair Fair, And they would stand auspicious to the Hour, Even there he starts, quoth he, I must deflour: The Powers to whom I pray, abhor this Fact, How can they then assist me in the Act? Then Love and Fortune be my Gods, my Guide, My Will is back'd with Resolution: Thoughts are but Dreams till their Effects be try'd, Black Sin is clear'd with Absolution; Against Love's Fire, Fear's Frost hath dissolution. The Eye of Heaven is out, and misty Night Covers the Shame that follows sweet Delight. This said, his guilty Hand pluck'd up the Latch, And with his Knee the Door he opens wide, The Dove sleeps fast that this night-Owl will catch. Thus Treason works e'er Traitors be espy'd: Who sees the lurking Serpent steps aside; But she, sound sleeping, fearing no such thing, Lies at the mercy of his mortal Sting. Into the Chamber wickedly he stalks, And gazeth on her yet unstained Bed: The Curtains being close, about he walks, Rolling his greedy Eye-balls in his Head, By their high Treason is his Heart misled, Which gives the Watch-word to his Hand too soon, To draw the Cloud that hides the Silver Moon. Look as the fair and fiery pointed Sun, Rushing from forth a Cloud, bereaves our sight: Even so the Curtain drawn, his Eyes begun To wink, being blinded with a greater Light: Whether it is that she reflects so bright That dazleth them, or else some Shame suppos'd; But blind they are, and keep themselves inclos'd. O had they in that darksom Prison died, Then had they seen the Period of their Ill; Then Colatine again by Lucrece side, In his clear Bed might have reposed still: But they must ope this blessed League to kill; And holy-thoughted Lucrece to their sight Must sell her Joy, her Life, her World's Delight. Her lilly Hand her rosy Cheeks lies under, Cozening the Pillow of a lawful Kiss, Who therefore angry, seems to part in sunder, Swelling on either side to want his Bliss, Between whose Hills her Head intombed is; Where like a virtuous Monument she lies, To be admir'd of leud unhallowed Eyes. Without the Bed her other fair Hand was On the green Coverlet, whose perfect White Shew'd like an April Dazy on the Grass, With pearly Sweat, resembling Dew of Night. Her Eyes like Marigolds had sheath'd their Light, And canopy'd in Darkness sweetly lay, Till they might open to adorn the Day. Her Hair like golden Threds plaid with her Breath, O modest Wantons, wanton Modesty! Showring Life's Triumph in the Map of Death, And Death's dim Look in Life's Mortality. Each in her sleep themselves so beautify, As if between them twain there were no strife, But that Life liv'd in Death, and Death in Life. Her Breasts like Ivory Globes circled with Blew, A pair of Maiden Worlds unconquered: Save of their Lord no bearing Yoke they knew, And him by Oath they truly honoured. These Worlds in Tarquin new Ambition bred, Who like a foul Usurper went about, From this fair Throne to have the Owner out. What could he see but mightily he noted? What did he note, but strongly he desir'd? What he beheld, on that he firmly doted, And in his Will his wilful Eye he tir'd. With more than Admiration he admir'd Her Azure Veins, her Alabaster Skin, Her Coral Lips, her Snow-white dimpled Chin. As the Grim Lion fauneth o're his Prey, Sharp Hunger by the Conquest satisfy'd: So o're this sleeping Soul doth Tarquin stay, His rage of Lust by gazing qualify'd, Slack'd, not supprest; for standing by her side, His Eye, which late this Mutiny restrains, Unto a greater Uproar tempts his Veins. And they like stragling Slaves for Pillage fighting, Obdurate Vassals fell Exploits effecting, In bloody Death and Ravishment delighting, Nor Childrens Tears, nor Mothers Groans respecting, Swell in their Pride, the Onset still expecting. Anon his beating Heart alarum striking, Gives the hot Charge, and bids them do their liking. His drumming Heart chears up his burning Eye, His Eye commends the leading to his Hand: His Hand as proud of such a Dignity, Smoking with Pride, marcht on to make his stand On her bare Breasts, the Heart of all her Land, Whose Ranks of blew Veins as his Hand did scale, Left their round Turrets destitute and pale. They mustring to the quiet Cabinet, Where their dear Governess and Lady lies, Do tell her she is dreadfully beset, And fright her with Confusion of her Cries. She much amaz'd breaks ope her lockt up Eyes; Who peeping forth this Tumult to behold, Are by his flaming Torch dim'd and control'd. Imagine her as one in dead of Night, From forth dull Sleep by dreadful Fancy waking, That thinks she hath beheld some gastly Sprite, Whose grim Aspect sets every Joint a shaking, What Terror 'tis: but she in worser taking, From Sleep disturbed, heedfully doth view The sight which makes supposed Terror rue. 5. Lucretia wakes amazed and confounded to be so surpriz'd. Wrapt and confounded in a thousand Fears, Like to a new-kil'd Bird she trembling lies: She dares not look, yet winking there appear Quick shifting Anticks ugly in her Eyes, Such Shadows are the weak Brain's Forgeries; Who angry that the Eyes fly from their Lights, In Darkness daunts them with more dreadful Sights. His Hand that yet remains upon her Breast, (Rude Ram to batter such an Ivory Wall) May feel her Heart (poor Citizen) distrest, Wounding it self to death, rise up and fall, Beating her Bulk, that his Hand shakes withal. This moves in him more Rage, and lesser Pity, To make the Breach, and enter this sweet City. First like a Trumpet doth his Tongue begin To sound a Parley to his heartless Foe, Who o're the white Sheet peers her whiter Chin, The reason of this rash Alarm to know, Which he by dumb Demeanor seeks to show: But she with vehement Prayers urgeth still, Under what Colour he commits this Ill. Thus he replys, The Colour in thy Face, That even for Anger makes the Lilly pale, And the red-Rose blush at her own Disgrace, Shall plead for me, and tell my loving Tale. Under that Colour am I come to scale Thy never-conquer'd Fort, the Fault is thine, For those thine Eyes betray thee unto mine. Thus I forestal thee: if thou mean to chide, Thy Beauty hath insnar'd thee to this Night, Where thou with patience must my Will abide, My Will that marks thee for my Earth's Delight, Which I to conquer sought with all my Might. But as Reproof and Reason beat it dead, By thy bright Beauty it was newly bred. I see what Crosses my Attempts will bring, I know what Thorns the growing Rose defends, I think the Hony guarded with a Sting, All this before-hand Counsel comprehends; But Will is deaf, and hears no heedful Friends. Only he hath an Eye to gaze on Beauty, And dotes on what he looks, 'gainst Law or Duty. I have debated even in my Soul, What Wrong, what Shame, what Sorrow I shall breed, But nothing can Affection's Course controul, Or stop the headlong Fury of his Speed; I know repentant Tears insue the Deed, Reproach, Disdain, and deadly Enmity, Yet strive I to imbrace mine Infamy. This said, he shakes aloft his Roman Blade, Which like a Faulcon tow'ring in the Skies, Couchet the Fowl below with his Wings shade, Whose crooked Beak threats, if he mount he dies: So under his insulting Fauchion lies Harmless Lucretia, marking what he tells, With trembling Fear, as Fowl hear Faulcon's Bells. Lucrece, quoth he, this Night I must injoy thee, If thou deny, then Force must work my way; For in thy Bed I purpose to destroy thee. That done, some worthless Slave of thine I'll slay, To kill thine Honour with thy Life's decay. And in thy dead Arms do I mean to place him, Swearing I slew him seeing thee imbrace him. So thy surviving Husband shall remain, The scornful Mark of every open Eye; The Kinsmen hang their heads at this disdain, Thy Issue blur'd with nameless Bastardy: And thou the Author of their Obloquy, Shalt have thy Trespass cited up in Rhimes, And sung by Children in succeeding Times. But if thou yield, I rest thy secret Friend, The Fault unknown is a Thought unacted; A little Harm done to a great good End, For lawful Policy remains enacted. The poisonous Simple sometimes is compacted In purest Compounds; being so apply'd, His Venom in effect is purify'd. Then for thy Husband, and thy Childrens sake, Tender my Suit, bequeath not to their Lot The Shame that from them no Device can take, The Blemish that will never be forgot, Worse than a slavish Wipe, or birth-hour's Blot: For Marks describ'd in Mens Nativity, Are Nature's Faults, not their own Infamy. Here with a Cockatrice dead-killing Eye, He rouseth up himself, and makes a pause; While she, the Picture of pure Piety, Like a white Hind beneath the Gripe's sharp Claws, Pleads in a Wilderness, where no Laws To the rough Beast, that knows no gentle Right, Nor ought obeys but his foul Appetite. But when a black-fac'd Cloud the World does threat, In his dim Mist th'aspiring Mountain hiding, From Earth's dark Womb some gentle Gust does get, Which blow these pitchy Vapors from their biding, Hindring their present Fall by this dividing. So his unhallowed hast her Words delays, And moody Pluto winks while Orpheus plays. Yet foul night-waking Cat he doth but dally, While in his hold-fast foot the weak Mouse panteth; Her sad Behaviour feeds his Vulture Folly, A swallowing Gulf that e'en in Plenty wanteth. His Ear her Prayers admits, but his Heart granteth No penetrable entrance to her plaining, Tears harden Lust, tho Marble wears with raining. Her pity-pleading Eyes are sadly fix'd In the remorsless Wrinkles of his Face: Her modest Eloquence with Sighs is mix'd, Which to her Oratory adds more Grace. She puts the Period often from his Place, And midst the Sentence so her Accent breaks, That twice she doth begin e'er once she speaks. 6. Lucrece pleadeth in defence of Chastity, and exprobrates his uncivil Lust. She conjures him by high Almighty Jove, By Knighthood, Gentry, and sweet Friendship's Oath, By her untimely Tears, her Husband's Love, By holy human Law, &amp; common Troth, By Heaven and Earth, and all the Power of both, That to his borrow'd Bed he make retire, And stoop to Honour, not to foul Desire. Quoth she, reward not Hospitality With such black Paiment as thou hast pretended, Mud not the Fountain that gave Drink to thee, Mar not the Thing that cannot be amended: End thy ill Aim, before thy shoot be ended. He is no Wood-man that doth bend his Bow, To strike a poor unseasonable Doe. My Husband is thy Friend, for his sake spare me; Thy self art mighty, for thine own sake leave me; My self a Weakling, do not then insnare me; Thou look'st not like Deceit, do not deceive me. My Sighs like Whirlwinds labour hence to heave thee: If ever Man was mov'd with Woman's Moans, Be moved with my Tears, my Sighs, my Groans. All which together, like a troubled Ocean, Beat at thy rocky and wreck-threatning Heart, To soften it with their continual Motion; For Stones dissolv'd to Water do convert. O if no harder than a Stone thou art, Melt at my Tears, and be compassionate, Soft Pity enters at an Iron Gate. In Tarquin's Likeness I did entertain thee, Hast thou put on his Shape to do him shame? To all the Host of Heaven I complain me; Thou wrong'st his Honour, wound'st his Princely Name, Thou art not what thou seem'st; and if the same, Thou seem'st not what thou art, a God, a King, For Kings like Gods should govern every thing. How will thy Shame be feeded in thine Age, When thus thy Vices bud before thy Spring? If in thy Hope thou dar'st do such Outrage, What dar'st thou not when once thou art a King? O be remembred, no outragious thing From Vassal Actors can be wip'd away, Then Kings Misdeeds cannot be hid in Clay. This Deed shall make thee only lov'd for Fear, But happy Monarchs still are fear'd for Love: With foul Offenders thou perforce must bear, When they in thee the like Offences prove: If but for fear of this, thy Will remove. For Princes are the Glass, the School, the Book, Where Subjects Eyes do learn, do read, do look. And wilt thou be the School where Lust shall learn? Must he in thee read Lectures of such Shame? Wilt thou be Glass wherein it shall discern Authority for Sin, Warrant for Blame? To privilege Dishonour in thy Name. Thou back'st Reproach against long-living Laud, And mak'st fair Reputation but a Baud. Hast thou commanded? by Him that gave it thee, From a pure Heart command thy rebel Will: Draw not thy Sword to guard Iniquity, For it was lent thee all that Brood to kill. Thy Princely Office how canst thou fulfil, When pattern'd by thy Fault, foul Sin may say, He learn'd to sin, and thou didst teach the way? Think but how vile a Spectacle it were, To view thy present Trespass in another: Mens Faults do seldom to themselves appear, Their own Transgressions partially they smother: This Guilt would seem death-worthy in thy Brother. O how are they wrapt in with Infamies, That from their own Misdeeds askaunce their Eyes! To thee, to thee, my heav'd up Hands appeal, Not to seducing Lust thy rash Reply: I sue for exil'd Majesty's Repeal, Let him return and flattering Thoughts retire. His true Respect will prison false Desire, And wipe the dim Mist from thy doting Eyes, That thou shalt see thy State and pity mine. 7. Tarquin all impatient interrupts her, and denied of Consent breaketh the inclosure of her Chastity by Force. Have done, quoth he, my uncontrouled Tide Turns not, but swells the higher by this let; Small Lights are soon blown out, huge Fires abide, And with the Wind in greater Fury fret: The pretty Streams that pay a daily Debt To their salt Sovereign with their fresh false hast, Add to this Flow, but alter not the Taste. Thou art (quoth she) a Sea, a Sovereign King, And lo! there falls into thy boundless Flood Black Lust, Dishonour, Shame, Misgoverning, Who seek to stain the Ocean of thy Blood. If all these petty Ills should change thy Good, Thy Sea within a puddle Womb is burs'd, And not the Puddle in thy Sea dispers'd. So shall these Slaves be King, and thou their Slave: Thou nobly base, they basely dignified; Thou their fair Life, and they thy fouler Grave: Thou loathed in thy Shame, they in thy Pride, The lesser thing should not the greater hide. The Cedar stoops not to the base Shrub's Foot, But low Shrubs wither at the Cedar's Root. So let thy Thoughts low Vassals to thy State. No more, quoth he, by Heav'n I will not hear thee: Yield to my Love; if not, enforced Hate, Instead of Love's coy Touch, shall rudely tear thee: That done, despitefully I mean to bear thee Unto the base Bed of some Rascal Groom, To be thy Partner in this shameful Doom. This said, he sets his Foot upon the Light, For Light and Lust are deadly Enemies: Shame folded up in blind concealing Night, When most unseen, then most doth tyrannize. The Wolf has seiz'd his Prey, the poor Lamb cries, Till with her own white Fleece her Voice control'd, Intombs her Outcry in her Lips sweet fold, For with the mighty Linen that she wears, He pens her piteous Clamors in her Head, Cooling his hot Face in the chastest Tears, That ever modest Eyes with Sorrow shed. O that foul Lust should stain so pure a Bed! The Spots whereof could Weeping purify, Her Tears should drop on them perpetually. Btt she hath lost a dearer thing than Life, And he hath won what he would lose again; This forced League doth force a further strife, This Momentary Joy breeds Months of Pain, This hot Desire converts to cold Disdain: Pure Chastity is rifled of her store, And Lust, the Thief, far poorer than before. Look as the full-fed Hound or gorged Hawk, Unapt for tender Smell or speedy Flight, Make slow pursuit, or altogether balk The Prey wherein by Nature they delight: So surfeit-taking Tarquin fears this Night; His Tast delicious, in Digestion souring, Devours his Will, that liv'd by foul devouring. O deeper Sin than bottomless Conceit Can comprehend in still Imagination! Drunken Desire must vomit his Receit, E'er he can see his own Abomination. While Lust is in his Pride, no Exclamation Can curb his Heat, of reign his rash Desire, Till, like a Jade, Self-will himself doth tire. And then with lank and lean discolor'd Cheek, With heavy Eye, knit Brow, and strengthless Pace, Feeble Desire all recreant, poor and meek, Like to a Bankrupt Beggar wails his Case: The Flesh being proud, Desire dos fight with Grace. For there it revels, and when that decays, The guilty Rebel for Remission prays. So fares it with this Fault-full Lord of Rome, Who this Accomplishment so hotly chas'd; For, now against himself he sounds this Doom, That thro the length of time he stands disgrac'd: Besides, his Soul's fair Temple is defac'd, To whose weak Ruins muster Troops of Cares, To ask the spotted Princess how she fares. She says, her Subjects with foul Insurrection Have batter'd down her consecrated Wall, And by their mortal Fault brought in subjection Her Immortality, and made her thrall To living Death and Pain perpetual. Which in her Prescience she controled still, But her Foresight could not forestall their Will. E'en in this Thought thro the dark night he stealeth, A Captive Victor that hath lost in Gain: Bearing away the Wound that nothing healeth, The Scar that will despight of Cure remain; Leaving his Spoil perplext in greater Pain. She bears the load of Lust he left behind, And he the Burden of a guilty Mind. He like a thievish Dog creeps sadly thence, She like a weary'd Lamb lies panting there: He scowls and hates himself for his Offence, She desperate, with her Nails her Flesh doth tear. He faintly flies, sweating with guilty Fear; She stays exclaiming on the direful Night, He runs and chides his vanisht loath'd Delight. He thence departs a heavy Convertite, She there remains a hopeless Cast-away: He in his speed looks for the Morning Light, She prays she never may behold the Day, For Day, quoth she, night-scapes doth open lay: And my true Eyes have never practis'd how To cloak Offences with a cunning Brow. They think not but that every Eye can see The same Disgrace which they themselves behold: And therefore would they still in Darkness lie, To have their unseen Sin remain untold: For they their Guilt with weeping will unfold, And grave, like Water that doth eat in Steel, Upon my Cheeks what helpless shame I feel. 8. Lucrece thus abused, complains of her Misery. Here she exclaims against Repose and Rest, And bids her Eyes hereafter still be blind: She wakes her Heart by beating on her Breast, And bids it leap from thence, where it may find Some purer Chest to close so pure a Mind. Frantick with Grief, thus breathes she forth her Spight Against the unseen Secrecy of Night. O comfort-killing Night, Image of Hell! Dim Register and Notary of Shame! Black Stage for Tragedies and Murders fell! Vast Sin-concealing Chaos, nurse of Blame! Blind muffl'd Baud, dark Harbour of Defame! Grim Cave of Death, whispring Conspirator With close-tongu'd Treason and the Ravisher! O hateful, vaporous and foggy Night! Since thou art guilty of my cureless Crime, Muster thy Mists to meet the Eastern Light, Make War against proportion'd Course of Time: Or if thou wilt permit the Sun to climb His wonted height, yet e'er he go to bed, Knit poisonous Clouds about his golden Head. With rotten damps ravish the Morning-Air, Let their exhal'd unwholesom Breaths make sick The Life of Purity, the supreme Fair, E'er he arrive his weary Noon-tide prick: And let thy misty Vapors march so thick, That in their smoaky Ranks his smother'd Light May set at Noon and make perpetual Night. Were Tarquin Night as he is but Night's Child, The Silver-shining Queen he would disdain, Her twinkling Handmaids too (by him defil'd) Thro Night's black Bosom should not peep again. So should I have Copartners in my Pain; And Fellowship in Woe doth Woe assuage, As Palmers that make short their Pilgrimage. Where now I have no one to blush with me, To cross their Arms and hang their Heads with mine, To mask their Brows and hide their Infamy. But I alone, alone must sit and pine, Seasoning the Earth with Showers of Silver Brine, Mingling my Talk with Tears, my Grief with Groans, Poor wasting Monuments of lasting Moans. O Night! thou Furnace of foul-recking Smoke, Let not the jealous Day behold that Face, Which underneath thy black all-hiding Cloak Immodestly lies martyr'd with Disgrace. Keep still possession of thy gloomy Place, That all the Faults which in thy Reign are made, May likewise be sepulchred in thy Shade. Make me not Object to the tell-tale Day, The Light shall shew character'd in my Brow The Story of sweet Chastity's Decay, The impious breach of holy Wedlock's Vow. Yea, the Illiterate, that know not how To cipher what is writ in Learned Books, Will quote my loathsom Trespass in my Looks. The Nurse to still her Child will tell my Story, And fright her crying Babe with Tarquin's Name: The Orator to deck his Oratory, Will couple my Reproach to Tarquin's Shame. Feast-finding Minstrels tuning my Defame, Will tie the Hearers to attend each Line, How Tarquin wronged me, I Colatine. Let my good Name, that senseless Reputation, For Colatine's dear Love be kept unspotted: If that be made a Theme for Disputation, The Branches of another Root are rotted, And undeserv'd Reproach to him allotted, That is as clear from this Attaint of mine, As I e're this was pure to Colatine. O unseen Shame, invisible Disgrace! O unfelt Sore, crest-wounding private Scar! Reproach is stampt in Colatinus Face, And Tarquin's Eye may read the Mote afar, How he in Peace is wounded, not in War. Alas, how many bear such shameful Blows, Which not themselves but he that gives them knows? If Colatine, thine Honor lay in me, From me by strong Assault it is bereft: My Hony lost, and I a drone-like Bee Have no Perfection of my Summer left, But rob'd and ransack'd by injurious Theft. In thy weak Hive a wandring Wasp hath crept, And suck'd the Hony which thy chast Bee kept. Yet am I guilty of thy Honor's wrack; Yet for thy Honour did I entertain him; Coming from thee, I could not put him back, For it had been Dishonor to disdain him, Besides, of Weariness he did complain him, And talk of Vertue (O unlook'd for Evil!) When Vertue is profan'd in such a Devil. Why should the Worm intrude the Maiden Bud? Or hateful Cuckows hatch in Sparrows Nests? Or Toads infect fair Founts with Venom Mud? Or Tyrant Folly lurk in gentle Breasts? Or Kings be Breakers of their own Behests? But no Perfection is so absolute, That some Impurity doth not pollute. The Aged Man that coffers up his Gold, Is plagu'd with Cramps, and Gouts, and painful Fits, And scarce hath Eyes his Treasure to behold, But like still pining Tantalus he sits, And useless Banns the Harvest of his Wits: Having no other Pleasure of his Gain, But Torment that it cannot cure his Pain. So then, he hath it when he cannot use it, And leaves it to be master'd by his Young, Who in their Pride do presently abuse it: Their Father was too weak, and they too strong, To hold their cursed blessed Fortune long. The Sweets we wish for turn to loathed Sours, E'en in the moment that we call them ours. Unruly Blasts wait on the tender Spring, Unwholesom Weeds take root with precious Flowers: The Adder hisseth where the sweet Birds sing: What Vertue breeds, Iniquity devours: We have no Good that we can say is ours: But ill-annexed Opportunity, Or kills his Life, or else his Quality. O Opportunity! thy Guilt is great; 'Tis thou that execut'st the Traitor's Treason: Thou setst the Wolf where he the Lamb may get: Whoever plots the Sin, thou pointst the Season. 'Tis thou that spurnst at Right, at Law, at Reason; And in thy shady Cell, where none may spy her, Sits Sin to seize the Souls that wander by her. Thou mak'st the Vestal violate her Oath; Thou blowst the Fire when Temperance is thaw'd; Thou smotherst Honesty, thou murderst Troth: Thou foul Abettor, thou notorious Baud! Thou plantest Scandal, and displacest Laud. Thou Ravisher, thou Traitor, thou false Thief! Thy Hony turns to Gall, thy Joy to Grief. Thy secret Pleasure turns to open Shame, Thy private Feasting to a publick Fast; Thy smothering Titles to a ragged Name; Thy sugar'd Tongue to bitter Wormwood Taste: Thy violent Vanities can never last. How comes it then, vile Opportunity, Being so bad, such Numbers seek for thee? When wilt thou be the humble Suppliant's Friend, And bring him where his Suit may be obtain'd? When wilt thou sort an Hour great Strifes to end, Or free that Soul which wretchedness hath chained? Give Physick to the sick, ease to the pained? The Poor, Lame, Blind, Halt, Creep, cry out for thee, But they ne'er met with Opportunity. The Patient dies while the Physician sleeps; The Orphan pines while the Oppressor feeds: Justice is feasting while the Widow weeps: Advice is sporting while Infection breeds, Thou grant'st no time for charitable Deeds: Wrath, Envy, Treason, Rape, and Murder rages, Thy heinous Hours wait on them as their Pages. When Truth and Vertue have to do with thee, A thousand Crosses keep them from thy Aid; They buy thy Help, but Sin ne'er gives a Fee, He gratis comes, and thou art well apaid, As well to hear, as grant what he hath said. My Colatine would else have come to me, When Tarquin did, but he was staid by thee. Guilty thou art of Murder and of Theft, Guilty of Perjury and Subornation, Guilty of Treason, Forgery and Shift, Guilty of Incest that Abomination; An Accessary by thine Inclination To all Sins past, and all that are to come From the Creation to the general Doom. Mishapen time, Copesmate of ugly Night, Swift subtle Post, Carrier of grisly Care, Eater of Youth, false Slave to false Delight, Base Watch of Woes, Sin's Pack-horse, Vertue's Snare; Thou nursest all, and murderst all that are. O hear me then, injurious shifting Time! Be guilty of my Death, since of my Crime. Why hath thy Servant Opportunity Betray'd the Hours thou gav'st me to repose? Cancel'd my Fortunes and inchained me To endless Date of never-ending Woes? Time's Office is to find the hate of Foes, To eat up Error by Opinion bred, Not spend the Dowry of a lawful Bed. Time's Glory is to calm contending Kings, To unmask Falshood, and bring Truth to Light, To stamp the Seal of Time in aged things, To wake the Morn and centinel the Night, To wrong the Wronger till he render Right, To ruinate proud Buildings with thy Hours, And smear with Dust their glittering golden Towers. To fill with Worm-holes stately Monuments, To feed Oblivion with Decay of things, To blot old Books, and alter their Contents, To pluck the Quills from antient Ravens Wings, To dry the old Oak's Sap, and cherish Springs, To spoil Antiquities of hammer'd Steel, And turn the giddy round of Fortune's Wheel. To shew the Beldame Daughters of her Daughter, To make the Child a Man, the Man a Child, To slay the Tyger that doth live by Slaughter, To tame the Unicorn and Lion wild, To mock the Subtle in themselves beguil'd; To chear the Plowman with increaseful crops, And waste huge Stones with little Water-drops. Why work'st thou Mischief in thy Pilgrimage, Unless thou could'st return to make amends? One poor retiring Minute in an Age, Would purchase thee a thousand thousand Friends, Lending him Wit that to bad Debtors lends. O this dread Night, wouldst thou one Hour come back, I could prevent this Storm and shun this Wrack. Thou ceaseless Lacky to Eternity, With some Mischance cross Tarquin in his Flight, Devise Extremes beyond Extremity To make him curse this cursed crimeful Night: Let ghastly Shadows his leud Eyes affright, And the dire Thought of his committed Evil Shape every Bush a hideous shapeless Devil. Disturb his hours of Rest with restless Trances, Afflict him in his Bed with bedrid Groans: Let there bechance him pitiful Mischances, To make him moan, but pity not his Moans: Stone him with harden'd Hearts harder than stone, And let mild Women to him lose their Mildness, Wilder to him than Tygers in their Wildness. Let him have time to tear his curled Hair, Let him have time against himself to rave, Let him have time of Time's help to despair, Let him have time to live a loathed Slave: Let him have time a Beggar's Orts to crave, And time to see one that by Alms do live, Disdain to him disdained Scraps to give. Let him have time to see his Friends his Foes, And merry Fools to mock at him resort: Let him have time to mark how slow Time goes In time of Sorrow, and how swift and short His time of Folly, and his time of Sport. And ever let his unrecalling Time Have time to wail th'abusing of his Time. O Time, thou Tutor both to Good and Bad, Teach me to curse him that thou taughtst this Ill, At his own Shadow let the Thief run mad, Himself, himself seek every Hour to kill; Such wretched Hands, such wretched Blood should spill. For who so base would such an Office have, As slanderous Deaths-man to so base a Slave? The baser is he, coming from a King, To shame his Hope with Deeds degenerate; The mightier Man, the mightier is the thing, That makes him honour'd, or begets him Hate: For greatest Scandal waits on greatest State. The Moon being clouded, presently is mist, But little Stars may hide them when they list. The Crow may bathe his cole-black Wings in Mire, And unperceiv'd fly with the Filth away; But if the like the snow-white Swan desire, The stain upon his silver Down will stay. Poor Grooms are sightless Night, Kings glorious Day, Gnats are unnoted wheresoe'er they fly, But Eagles gaz'd upon with every Eye. Our idle Words, Servants to shallow Fools, Unprofitable Sounds, weak Arbitrators, Busy your selves in skill-contending Schools, Debate where leisure serves with dull Debators: To trembling Clients be you Mediators: For me, I force not Argument a straw, Since that my Case is past all help of Law. In vain I rail at Opportunity, At Time, at Tarquin, and unsearchful Night: In vain I cavil with mine Infamy, In vain I spurn at my confirm'd Despight: This helpless smoke of Words doth me no right; The Remedy indeed to do me good, Is to let forth my foul defiled Blood. Poor Hand, why quiverst thou at this Decree? Honour thy self to rid me of this Shame, For if I die, my Honour lives in thee; But if I live, thou liv'st in my Defame; Since thou couldst not defend thy Loyal Dame, And wast afraid to scratch her wicked Foe, Kill both thy self and her for yielding so. This said, from her betumbled Couch she starts, To find some desperate Instrument of Death; But this no Slaughter-house, no Tool imparts, To make more vent for passage of her Breath, Which thronging thro her Lips so vanisheth As Smoke from Ætna, that in Air consumes, Or that which from discharged Cannon fumes. In vain (quoth she) I live, and seek in vain Some happy Mean to end a hapless Life: I fear'd by Tarquin's Fauchion to be slain, Yet for the self-same Purpose seek a Knife: But when I fear'd, I was a Loyal Wife, So am I now: O no, that cannot be, Of that true Type hath Tarquin rifled me. O that is gone, for which I sought to live, And therefore now I need not fear to die; To clear this Spot by Death (at least) I give A Badg of Fame to Slaunder's Livery, A dying Life to living Infamy, Poor helpless help the Treasure stoln away, To burn the guiltless Casket where it lay. Well, well, dear Colatine, thou shalt not know The stained tast of violated Troth: I will not wrong thy true Affection so, To flatter thee with an infringed Oath, This bastard Grass shall never come to growth; He shall not boast who did thy Stock pollute, That thou art doting Father of his Fruit. Nor shall he smile at thee in secret Thought, Nor laugh with his Companions at thy state: But thou shalt know thy Interest was not bought Basely with Gold, but stoln from forth thy Gate; For me I am the Mistress of my Fate, And with my Trespass never will dispense, Till Life to Death acquit my frost Offence. I will not poison thee with my Attaint, Nor fold my Fault in cleanly coin'd Excuses; My sable ground of Sin I will not paint, To hide the Truth of this false Night's Abuses: My Tongue shall utter all; mine Eyes like Sluces, As from a Mountain Spring that feeds a Dale, Shall gush pure Streams to purge my impure Tale. 9. Lucrece continuing her Laments, disputes whether she should kill her self or no. By this lamenting Philomele had ended The well-tun'd Warble of her nightly Sorrow, And solemn Night with slow sad Gate descended To ugly Hell, when lo the blushing Morrow Lends Light to all fair Eyes that Light would borrow. But cloudy Lucrece shames her self to see, And therefore still in Night would cloistred be. Revealing Day through every Cranny spies, And seems to point her out where she sits weeping, To whom she sobbing speaks, O Eye of Eyes, Why pry'st thou thro my Window? leave thy peeping, Mock with thy tickling Beams, Eyes that are sleeping; Brand not my Forehead with thy piercing Light, For Day hath nought to do what's done by Night. Thus cavils she with ev'ry thing she sees; True Grief is fond, and testy as a Child, Who way-ward once, his Mood with nought agrees, Old Woes, not Infant Sorrows bear them mild; Continuance tames the one, the other wild, Like an unpractis'd Swimmer plunging still, With too much labour drowns for want of Skill. So she deep drenched in a Sea of Care, Holds disputation with each thing she views, And to her self all Sorrow doth compare, No Object but her Passions strength renews, And as one shifts, another straight ensues; Sometimes her Grief is dumb, and hath no words; Sometime 'tis mad, and too much talk affords. The little Birds that tune their Mornings Joy, Make her Moans mad with their sweet Melody; For Mirth doth search the bottom of Annoy, Sad Souls are slain in merry Company, Grief best is pleas'd with Grief's Society: True Sorrow then is feelingly surpriz'd, When with like semblance it is simpathiz'd. 'Tis double Death to drown in ken of Shore; He ten times pines, that pines beholding Food; To see the Salve doth make the Wound ake more; Great Grief grieves most at that will do it good; Deep Woes roll forward like a gentle Flood, Which being stopt, the bounding Banks o'er-flows; Grief dallied with, nor Law nor Limit knows. You mocking Birds, quoth she, your Tunes intomb Within your hollow swelling feather'd Breasts; And in my hearing be you ever dumb, My restless Discord loves no Stops nor Rests; A woful Hostess brooks not merry Guests: Relish your nimble Notes to pleasing Ears, Distress likes dumps when Time is kept with Tears. Come Philomele, that sing'st of Ravishment, Make thy sad Grove in my dishevel'd Hair: As the dank Earth weeps at thy Languishment, So I at each sad Strain will strain my Tear, And with deep Groans the Diapason bear: For Burden-wise I'll hum on Tarquin still, While thou on Tereus descants better skill. And whiles against a Thorn thou bearst thy part, To keep thy sharp Woes waking, wretched I To imitate thee well, against my Heart Will fix a sharp Knife, to affright mine Eye, Who if it wink, shall thereon fall and die. These Means as Frets upon an Instrument, Shall tune our Heartstrings to true Languishment. And for poor Bird, thou sing'st not in the Day, As shaming any Eye should thee behold: Some dark deep Desart seated from the way, That knows nor parching Heat, nor freezing Cold, Will we find out; and there we will unfold To Creatures stern, sad Tunes to change their Kinds; Since Men prove Beasts, let Beasts bear gentle Minds. As the poor frighted Deer that stands at gaze, Wildly determining which way to fly, Or one incompast with a winding Maze, That cannot tread the way out readily: So with her self is she in mutiny, To live or die, which of the twain were better, When Life is sham'd &amp; Death reproaches Debtor. To kill my self, quoth she, alack what were it, But with my Body my poor Soul's Pollution? They that lose half with greater patience bear it, Than they whose whole is swallowed in confusion. That Mother tries a merciless Conclusion, Who having two sweet Babes, when Death takes one, Will slay the other, and be Nurse to none. My Body or my Soul, which was the dearer? When the one Pure, the other made Divine, Whose love of either to my self was nearer? When both were kept for Heaven and Colatine. Ay me, the Bark peal'd from the lofty Pine, His Leaves will wither, and his Sap decay; So must my Soul, her Bark being peal'd away. Her House is sackt, her Quiet interrupted, Her Mansion batter'd by the Enemy, Her Sacred Temple spotted, spoil'd, corrupted, Grosly ingirt with daring Infamy. Then let it not be call'd Impiety, If in this blemisht Fort I make some Hole, Thro which I may convey this troubled Soul. Yet die I will not, till my Colatine Have heard the Cause of my untimely Death, That he may vow in that sad Hour of mine, Revenge on him that made me stop my Breath; My stained Blood to Tarquin I'll bequeath, Which by him tainted shall for him be spent, And as his due, writ in my Testament. My Honour I'll bequeath unto the Knife, That wounds my Body so dishonoured: 'Tis Honour to deprive dishonoured Life, The one will live, the other being dead: So of Shame's Ashes shall my Fame be bred; For in my death I Murder shameful scorn, My Shame so dead, my Honor is new born. Dear Lord of that dear Jewel I have lost, What Legacy shall I bequeath to thee? My Resolution, Love, shall be thy boast, By whose Example thou reveng'd mayst be. How Tarquin must be us'd read it in me. My self thy Friend will kill my self thy Fo, And for my sake serve thou false Tarquin so. This brief Abridgment of my Will I make: My Soul and Body to the Skies and Ground, My Resolution (Husband) do you take; My Honour be the Knife's that make my Wound My Shame be his that did my Fame confound; And all my Fame that lives disbursed be To those that live and think no shame of me. Then Colatine shall oversee this Will, How was I overseen that thou shalt see it? My Blood shall wash the Slander of mine Ill; My Life's foul Deed, my Life's fair End shall free it. Faint not faint Heart, but stoutly say, so be it. Yield to my Hand, and that shall conquer thee; Thou dead, that dies, and both shall Victors be. 10. Lucrece resolved to kill her self, determines first to send her Husband word. This Plot of Death, when sadly she had laid, And wip'd the brinish Pearl from her bright Eyes, With untun'd Tongue she hoarsly call'd her Maid, Whose swift Obedience to her Mistress hies, For fleet-wing'd Duty with Thought's Feathers flies. Poor Lucrece Cheeks unto her Maid seem so, As Winter-Meads when Sun dos melt their Snow. Her Mistress she doth give demure good-morrow, With soft slow Tongue, true Marks of Modesty, And sorts a sad look to her Lady's Sorrow, (For why her Face wore Sorrow's Livery) But durst not ask of her audaciously, Why her two Sons were Cloud-eclipsed so, Nor why her fair Cheeks over-washt with Woe. But as the Earth doth weep, the Sun being set, Each Flower moistned like a melting Eye: E'en so the Maid with swelling Drops gan wet Her circled Eyne enforc'd, by simpathy Of those fair Suns set in her Mistress Sky, Who in a salt-wav'd Ocean quench their Light, Which makes the Maid weep like the dewy Night. A pretty while these pretty Creatures stand, Like Ivory Conduits Coral Cisterns filling: One justly weeps, the other takes in hand No Cause, but company of her Drops spilling; Their gentle Sex to weep are often willing, Grieving themselves to guess at other Smarts, And then they drown their Eyes, or break their Hearts. For Men have Marble, Women waxen Minds, And therefore are they form'd as Marble will: The Weak opprest, th'Impression of strange kinds Is form'd in them by Force, by Fraud or Skill. Then call them not the Authors of their Ill, No more than Wax shall be accounted Evil, Wherein is stampt the semblance of a Devil. Their smoothness like a Champain Plain, Lays open all the little Worms that creep In Men, as a rough grown Grove remain Cave, keeping Evils that obscurely sleep; Thro Christal Walls each little Mote will peep. Tho Men can cover Crimes with bold stern Look, Poor Womens Faces are their own Faults Books. No Man inveighs against the wither'd Flower, But chides rough Winter that the Flower has kil'd: Not that devour'd, but that which doth devour Is worthy blame, O let it not be held Poor Womens Faults, that they are so fulfil'd With Mens Abuses, those proud Lords to blame, Make weak-mad Women Tenants to their shame. The President whereof in Lucrece view, Assail'd by Night, with Circumstances strong Of present Death and Shame that might ensue, By that her Death to do her Husband wrong; Such Danger to resistance did belong. The dying Fear thro all her Body spread, And who cannot abuse a Body dead? By this mild Patience did fair Lucrece speak To the poor Counterfeit of her complaining: My Girl, quoth she, on what occasion break Those Tears from thee, that down thy Cheeks are raining? If thou dost weep for Grief of my sustaining, Know gentle Wench, it small avails my Mood, If Tears could help mine, own would do me good. But tell me, Girl, when went (and there she staid, Till after a deep Groan) Tarquin from hence? Madam, e'er I was up (reply'd the Maid) The more to blame my sluggard Negligence: Yet with the Fault I thus far can dispense, My self was stirring e'er the break of day, And e'er I rose was Tarquin gone away. But, Lady, if your Maid may be so bold, She would request to know your Heaviness. O peace (quoth Lucrece) if it should be told, The Repetition cannot make it less: For more it is than I can well express, And that deep Torture may be call'd a Hell, When more is felt than one hath power to tell. Go get me hither Paper, Ink, and Pen; Yet save that labour, for I have them here: (What should I say?) one of my Husband's men Bid thou be ready by and by to bear A Letter to my Lord, my Love, my Dear; Bid him with speed prepare to carry it, The Cause craves hast, and it will soon be writ. Her Maid is gon, and she prepares to write, First hovering o'er the Paper with her Quill; Conceit and Grief an eager Combat fight, What Wit sets down is blotted still with Will, This is too curious good, this blunt and ill; Much like a Press of People at a Door, Throng her Inventions which shall go before. At last she thus begins: Thou worthy Lord Of that unworthy Wife that greeteth thee, Health to thy Person, next vouchsafe t'afford (If ever, Love, thy Lucrece thou wilt see) Some present speed to come and visit me. So I commend me from our House in grief, My Woes are tedious, tho my Words are brief. Here folds she up the Tenor of her Woe, Her certain Sorrow writ uncertainly; By this short Schedule Colatine may know Her Grief, but not her Grief's true Quality; She dares not therefore make discovery, Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse, E'er she with Blood had stain'd her stain'd Excuse. Besides the life and feeling of her Passion, She hoards to spend, when he is by to hear her, When Sighs, and Groans, and Tears may grace the fashion Of her Disgrace, the better so to clear her From that suspicion which the World might bear her: To shun this Blot she would not blot the Letter With Words, till Action might become them better. To see sad Sights, moves more than hear them told; For then the Eye interprets to the Ear The heavy Motion that it doth behold: When every Part a part of Woe doth bear, 'Tis but a part of Sorrow that we hear. Deep Sounds make lesser Noise than shallow Fords, And Sorrow ebbs being blown with Wind of Words. Her Letter now is seal'd, and on it writ, At Ardea to my Lord with more than hast; The Post attends, and she delivers it, Charging the sour-fac'd Groom to hie as fast, As lagging Souls before the Northern Blast. Speed, more than Speed, but dull and slow she deems, Extremity still urgeth such Extremes. The homely Villain cursies to her low, And blushing on her with a stedfast Eye, Receives the Scroll without or Yea or No, And forth-with bashful Innocence doth lie. But they whose Guilt within their Bosoms lie, Imagine every Eye beholds their blame, For Lucrece thought he blusht to see her shame. When silly Groom (God wot) it was defect Of Spirit, Life, and bold Audacity; Such harmless Creatures have a true respect To talk in Deeds, while others saucily Promise more speed, but do it leisurely. Even so this Pattern of the worn-out Age Pawn'd honest Looks, but laid no Words to gage. His kindled Duty kindled her Mistrust, That two red Fires in both their Faces blaz'd: She thought he blusht as knowing Tarquin's Lust; And blushing with him, wistly on him gaz'd, Her earnest Eye did make him more amaz'd: The more she saw the Blood his Cheeks replenish, The more she thought he spy'd in her some blemish. But long she thinks till he return again, And yet the duteous Vassal scarce is gone; The weary Time she cannot entertain, For now 'tis stale to sigh, to weep, and groan. So Woe hath wearied Woe, Moan tired Moan, That she her Plaints a little while doth stay, Pausing for Means to mourn some newer way. At last she calls to mind where hangs a piece Of skilful Painting made for Priam's Troy, Before the which is drawn the Power of Greece, For Helen's Rape the City to destroy, Threatning cloud-kissing Ilion with Annoy; Which the conceited Painter drew so proud, As Heaven (it seem'd) to kiss the Turrets bow'd. A thousand lamentable Objects there, In scorn of Nature, Art gave lifeless Life: Many a dire Drop seem'd a weeping Tear, Shed for the slaughter'd Husband by the Wife. The red Blood reek'd to shew the Painter's Strife, And dying Eyes gleem'd forth their ashy Lights, Like dying Coals burnt out in tedious Nights. There might you see the labouring Pioneer Begrim'd with Sweat, and smeared all with Dust; And from the Towers of Troy there would appear The very Eyes of Men thro Loop-holes thrust; Gazing upon the Greeks with little Lust. Such sweet Observance in this work was had, That one might see those far off Eyes look sad. In great Commanders, Grace and Majesty You might behold triumphing in their Faces; In Youth Quick-bearing and Dexterity: And here and there the Painter interlaces Pale Cowards marching on with trembling Paces, Which heartless Peasants did so well resemble, That one would swear he saw them quake and tremble. In Ajax and Ulysses, O what Art Of Physiognomy might one behold! The Face of either cipher'd either's Heart; Their Face, their Manners most expresly told. In Ajax Eyes blunt Rage and Rigor roll'd. But the mild Glance that she Ulysses lent, Shew'd deep Regard and smiling Government. There pleading might you see grave Nestor stand, As 'twere incouraging the Greeks to fight, Making such sober Actions with his Hand, That it beguil'd Attention, charm'd the Sight: In Speech it seem'd his Beard, all silver white, Wag'd up and down, and from his Lips did fly Thin winding Breath, which purl'd up to the Sky. About him were a Press of gaping Faces, Which seem'd to swallow up his sound Advice; All jointly listning, but with several Graces, As if some Mermaid did their Ears intice, Some high, some low, the Painter was so nice. The Scalps of many almost hid behind, To jump up higher seem'd to mock the Mind. Here one Man's Hand lean'd on another's Head, His Nose being shadow'd by his Neighbour's Ear; Here one being throng'd bears back all boln and red; Another smother'd, seems to pelt and swear, And in their Rage such Signs of Rage they bear, As but for loss of Nestor's Golden Words, It seems they would debate with angry Swords. For much imaginary Work was there; Conceit deceitful, so compact, so kind, That for Achilles Image stood his Spear, Grip'd in an armed Hand, himself behind Was left unseen, save to the Eye of Mind, A Hand, a Foot, a Face, a Leg, a Head, Stood for the Whole to be imagined. And from the Walls of strong besieged Troy, When their brave Hope, bold Hector, march'd to Field, Stood many Trojan Mothers, sharing Joy To see their youthful Sons bright Weapons wield, And to their Hope they such odd Action yield, That thro their Light Joy seemed to appear (Like bright things stain'd) a kind of heavy Fear. And from the strond of Dordan where they fought, To Simois reedy Banks the red blood ran, Whose Waves to imitate the Battel sought With swelling Ridges, and their Ranks began To break upon the galled Shore, and then Retire again, till meeting greater Ranks They join, and shoot their Fome at Simois Banks. To this well-painted Piece is Lucrece come, To find a Face where all distress is stell'd: Many she sees, where Cares have carved some, But none where all Distress and Dolor dwell'd; Till she despairing Hecuba beheld, Staring on Priam's Wounds with her old Eyes, Which bleeding under Pirrhus proud Foot lies. In her the Painter had anatomiz'd Time's ruin, Beauty's wrack, and grim Cares reign; Her Cheeks with Chops and Wrinkles were disguis'd, Of what she was, no Semblance did remain, Her blew Blood chang'd to black in every Vein. Wanting the Spring that those shrunk Pipes had fed, Shew'd Life imprison'd in a Body dead. On this sad shadow Lucrece spends her Eyes, And shapes her Sorrow to the Beldame's Woes, Who nothing wants to answer her but Cries, And bitter Words to ban her cruel Foes. The Painter was no God to lend her those; And therefore Lucrece swears he did her wrong, To give her so much Grief, and not a Tongue. Poor Instrument (quoth she) without a Sound, I'll tune thy Woes with my lamenting Tongue; And drop sweet Balm in Priam's painted Wound, And rail on Pirrhus that hath done him wrong, And with my Tears quench Troy that burns so long; And with my Knife scratch out the angry Eyes Of all the Greeks that are thine Enemies. Shew me this Strumpet that began this stir, That with my Nails her Beauty I may tear: Thy heat of Lust, fond Paris, did incur This load of Wrath that burning Troy did bear; Thy Eye kindled the Fire that burneth here. And here in Troy, for Trespass of thine Eye, The Sire, the Son, the Dame, and Daughter die. Why should the private Pleasure of some one Become the publick Plague of many moe? Let Sin alone committed, light alone Upon his Head that hath transgressed so. Let guiltless Souls be freed from guilty woe. For ones Offence why should so many fall? To plague a private Sin in general. Lo, here weeps Hecuba, here Priam dies! Here manly Hector faints, here Troylus sounds, Here Friend by Friend in bloody Channel lies, And Friend to Friend gives unadvised Wounds, And one Man's Lust these many Lives confounds. Had doting Priam check'd his Son's desire, Troy had been bright with Fame, and not with Fire. Here feelingly she weeps Troy's painted Woes: For Sorrow like a heavy hanging Bell, Once set a ringing, with his own weight goes; Then little strength rings out the doleful Knell. So Lucrece set awork, sad Tales doth tell To pencil'd Pensiveness, and color'd Sorrow; She lends them Words, and she their Looks doth borrow. She throws her Eyes about the painted Round, And whom she finds forlorn she doth lament: At last she sees a wretched Image bound, That piteous Looks to Phrygian Shepherds lent, His Face tho full of Cares, yet shew'd Content. Onward to Troy with these blunt Swains he goes, So mild that Patience seem'd to scorn his Woes. In him the Painter labour'd with his Skill To hide deceit, and give the harmless show, An humble Gate, calm Looks, Eyes wailing still, A Brow unbent, that seem'd to welcome Woe; Cheeks, neither red nor pale, but mingled so, That blushing red, no guilty Instance gave, Nor ashy pale, the Fear that false Hearts have. But like a constant and confirmed Devil, He entertain'd a show so seeming just, And therein so insconst this secret Evil, That Jealousy it self could not mistrust, False creeping Craft and Perjury should thrust Into so bright a Day such blackfac'd Storms, Or blot with Hell-born Sin such Saint-like Forms. The well-skil'd Woman this wild Image drew For perjur'd Sinon, whose inchanting Story The credulous old Priam after slew: Whose Words like wild-fire burnt the shining Glory Of rich-built Ilion, that the Skies were sorry, And little Stars shot from their fixed Places, When their Glass fell wherein they view'd their Faces. This Picture she advisedly perus'd, And chid the Painter for his wondrous Skill: Saying, some shape in Sinon's was abus'd, So fair a Form lodg'd not a Mind so ill: And still on him she gaz'd, and gazing still, Such Signs of Truth in his plain Face she spied, That she concludes, the Picture was belied. It cannot be (quoth she) that so much Guile (She would have said) can lurk in such a Look: But Tarquin's shape came in her Mind the while, And from her Tongue, can lurk, from cannot, took It cannot be, she in that Sense forsook, And turn'd it thus, It cannot be I find, But such a Face should bear a wicked Mind. For e'en as subtle Sinon here is painted, So sober sad, so weary and so mild, (As if with Grief or Travel he had fainted) To me came Tarquin armed to beguild With outward Honesty, but yet defil'd With inward Vice; as Priam him did cherish, So did I Tarquin, so my Troy did perish. Look, look how listning Priam wets his Eyes, To see those borrow'd Tears that Sinon sheds: Priam, why art thou old, and yet not wise? For every Tear he falls, a Trojan bleeds: His Eyes drop Fire, no Water thence proceeds: Those round clear Pearls of his that move thy Pity Are Balls of quenchless Fire to burn thy City. Such Devils steal Effects from lightless Hell, For Sinon in his Fire doth quake with cold, And in that cold hot-burning Fire doth dwell; These Contraries such Unity do hold, Only to flatter Fools and make them bold: So Priam's Trust false Sinon's Tears doth flatter, That he finds means to burn his Troy with Water. Here all inrag'd such Passion her assails, That Patience is quite beaten from her Breast; She tears the sensless Sinon with her Nails, Comparing him to that unhappy Guest, Whose Deed hath made her self her self detest. At last she smilingly with this gives o'er, Fool, Fool, quoth she, his Wounds will not be sore. Thus ebbs and flows the Current of her Sorrow, And Time doth weary Time with her complaining; She looks for Night, and then she longs for Morrow, And both she thinks too long with her remaining, Short time seems long, in Sorrows sharp sustaining: Tho Woe be heavy, yet it seldom sleeps, And they that watch, see Time how slow it creeps. Which all this Time hath over-slipt her Thought, That she with painted Images hath spent, Being from the feeling of her own Grief brought, By deep surmise of others Detriment, Loosing her Woes in shews of Discontent: It easeth some, tho none it ever cur'd, To think their Dolour others have endur'd. Upon Lucrece sending for Colatine in such hast, he with divers of his Allies and Friends, returns home. But now the mindful Messenger comes back, Brings home his Lord, and other Company, Who finds his Lucrece clad in mourning Black, And round-about her tear-distained Eye Blew Circles stream'd, like Rainbows in the Sky. These Watergalls in her dim Element, Foretel new Storms to those already spent. Which when her sad beholding Husband saw, Amazedly in her sad Face he stares: Her Eyes, tho sod in Tears, look red and raw, Her lively Colour kil'd with deadly Cares. He has no power to ask her how she fares, But stood like old Acquaintance in a Trance, Met far from home, wondring each other's Chance. At last he takes her by the bloodless Hand, And thus begins: What uncouth ill Event Hath thee befallen, that thou dost trembling stand? Sweet Love, what Spite hath thy fair Colour spent? Why art thou thus attir'd in Discontent? Unmask, dear Dear, this moody Heaviness, And tell thy Grief that we may give redress. Three times with Sighs she gives her Sorrow fire, E'er once she can discharge one word of Woe: At length addrest to answer his desire, She modestly prepares, to let them know Her Honour is ta'en Prisoner by the Foe; While Colatine, and his consorted Lords With sad attention long to hear her Words. And now this pale Swan in her watry Nest, Begins the sad Dirge of her certain ending: Few Words, quoth she, shall fit the Trespass best, Wherein no Excuse can give the Fault amending, In me more Woes than Words are now depending, And my Laments would be drawn out too long, To tell them all with one poor tir'd Tongue. Then be this all the Task it hath to say, Dear Husband, in the Interest of thy Bed A Stranger came, and on that Pillow lay Where thou wast wont to rest thy weary Head; And that Wrong else may be imagined, By foul Inforcement might be done to me, From that, alas, thy Lucrece is not free. For in the dreadful dead of dark Midnight, With shining Fauchion in my Chamber came A creeping Creature with a flaming Light, And softly cry'd, Awake, thou Roman Dame, And entertain my Love, else lasting Shame On thee and thine this Night I will inflict, If thou my Love's Desire do contradict. For some hard-favour'd Groom of thine, quoth he, Unless thou yoak thy liking to my Will, I'll murder streight, and then I'll slaughter thee, And swear I found you where you did fulfil The loathsom Act of Lust; and so did kill The Leachers in their Deed, this Act will be My Fame, and thy perpetual Infamy. With this I did begin to start and cry, And then against my Heart he sets his Sword, Swearing, unless I took all patiently, I should not live to speak another word: So should my Shame still rest upon Record, And never be forgot in mighty Rome Th'adulterate death of Lucrece and her Groom. Mine Enemy was strong, my poor self weak, (And far the weaker with so strong a Fear) My bloody Judg forbad my Tongue to speak, No rightful Plea might plead for Justice there: His Scarlet Lust came Evidence to swear, That my poor Beauty had purloin'd his Eyes; And when the Judg is rob'd, the Prisoner dies. O teach me how to make mine own Excuse, Or, at the least, this Refuge let me find; Tho my gross Blood be stain'd with this Abuse, Immaculate and spotless is my Mind, That was not forc'd, that never was inclin'd To accessary Yieldings, but still pure Doth in her poison'd Closet yet indure. Lo here the hopeless Merchant of this Loss, With Head inclin'd, and Voice dam'd up with Wo, With sad set Eyes, and wretched Arms across, From Lips new waxen pale, begins to blow The Grief away, that stops his Answer so. But wretched as he is, he strives in vain, What he breathes out, his Breath drinks up again. As thro an Arch, the violent roaring Tide, Out-runs the Eye that doth behold his hast; Yet in the Eddie boundeth in his Pride, Back to the Strait that forc'd him on so fast; In rage sent out, recal'd in rage being past: Even so his Sighs, his Sorrows make a Saw, To push Grief on, and back the same Grief draw. Which speechless Wo of his poor she attendeth, And his untimely Frenzy thus awaketh: Dear Lord, thy Sorrow to my Sorrow lendeth Another Power, no Flood by raining slacketh; My Wo too sensible thy Passion maketh More feeling painful, let it then suffice To drown one Wo, one pair or weeping Eyes. And for my sake when I might charm thee so, For she that was thy Lucrece now attend me, Be suddenly revenged on my Foe, Thine, mine, his own; suppose thou dost defend me From what is past, the help that thou shalt lend me Comes all too late, yet let the Traytor die; For sparing Justice feeds Iniquity. But e'er I name him, you fair Lords, quoth she, (Speaking to those that came with Colatine) Shall plight your honourable Faiths to me, With swift pursuit to venge this Wrong of mine: For 'tis a meritorious fair Design, To chase Injustice with revengeful Arms, Knights by their Oaths should right poor Ladies Harms. Upon the Relation of Lucrece her Rape, Colatine, and the rest, swear to revenge; but this seems not full satisfaction to her losses. At this Request, with noble Disposition, Each present Lord began to promise Aid, As bound in Knighthood to her Imposition, Longing to hear the hateful Foe bewray'd: But she that yet her sad Task hath not said, The Protestation stops. O speak, quoth she, How may this forced Stain be wip'd from me? What is the Quality of my Offence, Being constrain'd with dreadful Circumstances? May my pure Mind with the foul Act dispense, My low declined Honour to advance? May any Terms acquit me from this Chance? The poison'd Fountain clears it self again, And why not I from this compelled Stain? She killeth her self, to exasperate them the more to punish the Delinquent. With this they all at once began to say, Her Body's Stain, the Mind untainted clears, While with a joyless Smile she turns away The Face, that Map, which deep Impression bears Of hard Misfortune carv'd it in with Tears. No no, quoth she, no Dame hereafter living, By my Excuse shall claim Excuses giving. Here with a Sigh, as if her Heart would break, She throws forth Tarquin's Name, He, he, she says: But more than he, her poor Tongue could not speak, Till after many Accents and Delays, Untimely Breathings, sick and short Assays, She utters this, He, he, fair Lord, 'tis he That guides this Hand to give this Wound to me. Even here sheathed in her harmless Breast A harmful Knife, that thence her Soul unsheath'd, That Blow did bail it from the deep unrest Of that polluted Prison where it breath'd; Her contrite Sighs unto the Clouds bequeath'd Her winged Spright, and thro her Wounds doth fly Life's lasting Date from cancel'd Destiny. Stone-still, astonish'd with this deadly Deed, Stood Colatine and all his Lordly Crew, Till Lucrece Father that beholds her bleed, Himself on her self-slaughter'd Body threw: And from the purple Fountain Brutus drew The murd'rous Knife; and as it left the place, Her Blood in pure Revenge, held it in Chase. And bubling from her Breast, it doth divide In two slow Rivers, that the crimson Blood Circles her Body in on every Side, Who like a late sack'd Island vastly stood Bare and unpeopled in this fearful Flood. Some of her Blood still pure and red remain'd, And some look'd black, and that false Tarquin stain'd. About the mourning and congealed Face Of that black Blood, a watry Rigol goes, Which seems to weep upon the tainted Place; And ever since a pitying Lucrece woes, Corrupted Blood some watry Token shows, And Blood untainted still doth red abide, Blushing at that which is so putrify'd. Daughter, dear Daughter, old Lucretius cries, That Life was mine, which thou hast here depriv'd; If in the Child the Father's Image lies, Where shall I live, now Lucrece is unliv'd? Thou wast not to this end from me deriv'd. If Children prædecease Progenitors, We are their Off-spring and they none of ours. Poor broken Glass, I often did behold In thy sweet Semblance, my old Age new born; But now that fair fresh Mirror, dim and old, Shews me a barebon'd Death by Time out-worn: O from my Cheeks my Image thou hast torn, And shiver'd all the Beauty from my Glass, That I no more can see what once I was. O Time, cease thou thy Course and hast no longer, If thou surcease to be that should survive: Shall rotten Death make conquest of the stronger, And leave the foultring feeble Souls alive? The old Bees die, the young possess their Hive; Then live sweet Lucrece, live again and see Thy Father die, and not thy Father thee. By this starts Colatine as from a Dream, And bids Lucretius give his Sorrow place, And then in Key-cold Lucrece bleeding Stream He falls, and bathes the pale fear in his Face, And counterfeits to die with her a space; Till manly Shame bids him possess his Breath, And live to be revenged on her Death. The deep Vexation of his inward Soul Hath serv'd a dumb Arrest upon his Tongue, Who made that Sorrow should his use controul, Or keep him from heart-easing Words so long, Begins to talk, but thro his Lips do throng Weak Words, so thick come in his poor Heart's Aid, That no Man could distinguish what he said. Yet sometime Tarquin was pronounced plain, But thro his Teeth, as if his Name he tore. This windy Tempest, till it blow up Rain, Held back his Sorrow's Tide to make it more. At last it rains, and busy Winds give o'er: Then Son and Father weep with equal Strife, Who should weep most for Daughter or for Wife. The one doth call her his, the other his, Yet neither may possess the Claim they lay. The Father says, she's mine; O mine she is, Replies her Husband; do not take away My Sorrow's Interest, let no Mourner say He weeps for her, for she was only mine, And only must be wail'd by Colatine. O, quoth Lucretius, I did give that Life Which she too early and too late hath spil'd. Wo, wo, quoth Colatine, she was my Wife, I own'd her, and 'tis mine that she hath kil'd. My Daughter and my Wife with Clamours fil'd The disperst Air, who holding Lucrece Life, Answer'd their Cries, my Daughter and my Wife. Brutus, who pluckt the Knife from Lucrece Side, Seeing such Emulation in their Wo, Began to cloath his Wit in State and Pride, Burying in Lucrece Wound his Follies show: He with the Romans was esteemed so, As silly jeering Ideots are with Kings, For sportive Words, and uttering foolish Things. But now he throws that shallow Habit by, Wherein the Policy did him disguise, And arm'd his long-hid Wits advisedly, To check the Tears in Colatinus Eyes: Thou wronged Lord of Rome, quoth he, arise; Let my unsounded self, suppos'd a Fool, Now set thy long experienc'd Wit to School. Why Colatine, is Wo the Cure for Wo? Do Wounds help Wounds, or Grief help grievous Deeds? Is it Revenge to give thy self a Blow For his foul Act, by whom thy fair Wife bleeds? Such childish Humour from weak Minds proceeds, Thy wretched Wife mistook the matter so, To slay her self, that should have slain her Foe. Couragious Roman, do not steep thy Heart In such lamenting Dew of Lamentations, But kneel with me, and help to bear thy part, To rouse our Roman Gods with Invocations, That they will suffer these Abominations (Since Rome her self in them doth stand disgrac'd) By our strong Arms from forth her fair Streets chas'd. Now by the Capitol that we adore, And by this chast Blood so unjustly stain'd, By Heaven's fair Sun that breeds the fat Earth's Store, By all our Country Rites in Rome maintain'd, And by chast Lucrece Soul that late complain'd Her Wrongs to us, and by this bloody Knife, We will revenge the Death of this true Wife. This said, he strook his Hand upon his Breast, And kist the fatal Knife to end his Vow: And to his Protestation urg'd the rest, Who wondring at him did his Words allow: Then jointly to the ground their Knees they bow, And that deep Vow which Brutus made before, He doth again repeat, and that they swore. When they had sworn to this advised Doom, They did conclude to bear dead Lucrece thence, To shew the bleeding Body throughout Rome, And so to publish Tarquin's foul Offence. Which being done, with speedy diligence, The Romans plausibly did give consent, To Tarquin's everlasting Banishment. VENUS and ADONIS Written by Mr. Shakespear. Even as the Sun with Purple colour'd Face, Had ta'en his last leave of the weeping Morn, Rose-cheekt Adonis hy'd him to the Chase: Hunting he lov'd, but Love he laught to Scorn: Sick-thoughted Venus makes amain unto him, And like a bold-fac'd Suiter 'gins to woo him. Thrice fairer than my self (thus she began) The Fields chief Flower, sweet above compare, Stain to all Nymphs, more lovely than a Man, More white and red than Doves or Roses are: Nature that made thee with her self at strife, Saith that the World hath ending with thy Life. Vouchsafe, thou Wonder, to alight thy Steed, And rein his proud head to the saddle Bow. If thou wilt deign this Favour, for thy Meed, A thousand hony Secrets shalt thou know: Here come and sit, where Serpent never hisses, And being set, I'll smother thee with Kisses. And yet not cloy thy Lips with loath'd Satiety, But rather famish them amid their Plenty, Making them red and pale with fresh Variety: Ten Kisses short as one, one long as twenty. A Summer's Day will seem an Hour but short, Being wasted in such time-beguiling Sport. With this, she seizeth on his sweating Palm, The President of pith and livelihood, And trembling in her Passion calls it Balm, Earth Sovereign salve to do a Goddess good: Being so inrag'd, desire doth lend her Force, Couragiously to pluck him from his Horse. Over one Arm the lusty Coarsers rein, Under the other was the tender Boy, Who blusht and power'd in a dull Disdain, With leaden Appetite, unapt to toy: She red and hot, as Coals of glowing Fire; He red for Shame, but frosty in desire. The studded Bridle on a ragged Bough, Nimbly she fastens (O how quick is Love!) The Steed is stalled up, and even now To tye the Rider she begins to prove: Backward she push'd him, as she would be thrust, And govern'd him in Strength, tho not in Lust. So soon was she along, as he was down, Each leaning on their Elbows and their Hips. Now doth she stroke his Cheek, now doth he frown, And 'gins to chide, but soon she stops his Lips; And kissing speaks, with lustful Language broken, If thou wilt chide, thy Lips shall never open. He burns with bashful Shame, she with her Tears Doth quench the Maiden burning of his Cheeks: Then with her windy Sighs, and golden Hairs, To fan and blow them dry again she seeks. He says she is immodest, blames her Miss, What follows more, she smothers with a Kiss. Even as an empty Eagle sharp by fast, Tires with her Beak on Feathers, Flesh and Bone, Shaking her Wings, devouring all in hast, Till either Gorge be stuft, or Prey be gone: Even so she kist his Brow, his Cheek, his Chin, And where she ends, she doth anew begin. Forc'd to content, but never to obey, Panting he lies, and breathing in her Face: She feedeth on the steam, as on a Prey, And calls it Heavenly Moisture, Air of Grace, Wishing her Cheeks were Gardens full of Flowers, So they were dew'd with such distilling Showers. Look how a Bird lies tangl'd in a Net, So fastned in her Arms Adonis lies: Pure Shame and aw'd Resistance made him fret, Which bred more Beauty in his angry Eyes. Rain added to a River that is rank, Perforce will force it overflow the Bank. Still she intreats, and prettily intreats, For to a pretty Ear she tunes her Tale: Still he is sullen, still he lowrs and frets, 'Twixt crimson Shame and Anger ashy pale; Being red she loves him best, and being white, Her Breast is better'd with a more Delight. Look how he can, she cannot chuse but love, And by her fair immortal Hand she swears, From his soft Bosom never to remove, Till he take truce with her contending Tears, Which long have rain'd, making her Cheeks all wet, And one sweet Kiss shall pay this countless Debt. Upon this Promise did he raise his Chin, Like a Dive-dapper peering thro a Wave; Who being look'd on, ducks as quickly in: So offers he to give what she did crave; But when his Lips were ready for his Pay, He winks and turns his Lips another way. Never did Passenger in Summer's Heat More thirst for Drink, than she for this good turn; Her help she sees, but Help she cannot get, She bathes in Water, yet in Fire must burn: Oh pity, gan she cry, flint-hearted Boy, 'Tis but a Kiss I beg, why art thou coy? I have been woo'd as I intreat thee now, Even by the stern and direful God of War, Whose Sinewy Neck in Battel ne'er did bow, Who conquers where he comes in every Jar: Yet hath he been my Captive and my Slave, And beg'd for that which thou unaskt shall have. Over my Altars hath he hung his Launce, His batter'd Shield, his uncontrolled Crest, And for my sake hath learn'd to sport and dance, To coy, to wanton, dally, smile and jest, Scorning his churlish Drum and Ensign red, Making my Arms his Field, his Tent my Bed. Thus he that over-rul'd, I over-sway'd, Leading him Prisoner in a red Rose chain: Strong temper'd Steel his stronger Strength obey'd, Yet was he servile to my coy Disdain. Oh be not proud, nor brag not of thy Might, For mastring her that foil'd the God of Fight. Touch but my Lips with those fair Lips of thine, (Tho mine be not so fair, yet are they red) The Kiss shall be thine own as well as mine. What seest thou in the ground? hold up thy Head: Look in my Eye-balls where thy Beauty lies, Then why not Lips on Lips, since Eyes on Eyes? Art thou asham'd to kiss? then wink again, And I will wink, so shall the Day seem Night. Love keeps his Revels where there be but twain: Be bold to play, our Sport is not in sight. These blue-vein'd Violets whereon we lean Never can blab, nor know they what we mean. The tender Spring, upon thy tempting Lip, Shews thee unripe; yet may'st thou well be tasted: Make use of time, let not Advantage slip; Beauty within it self would not be wasted; Fair Flowers that are not gather'd in their prime, Rot and consume themselves in little time. Were I hard-favoured, foul, or wrinkled old, Ill-natur'd, crooked, churlish, harsh in Voice, O'er-worn, despised, rheumatick and cold, Thick-sighted, barren, lean, and lacking juice, Then mightst thou pause, for then I were not for thee: But having no Defects why dost abhor me? Thou canst not see one Wrinkle in my Brow, Mine Eyes are grey, and bright, and quick in turning; My Beauty as the Spring doth yearly grow, My Flesh as soft and plump, my Marrow burning: My smooth moist Hand, were it with thy Hand felt, Would in thy Palm dissolve, or seem to melt. Bid me discourse, I will inchant thine Ear, Or like a Fairy, trip upon the Green; Or like a Nymph, with long dishevel'd Hair, Dance on the Sands, and yet no footing seen. Love is a Spirit all compact of Fire, Not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire. Witness this Primrose Bank whereon I lye, The forceless Flowers like sturdy Trees support me: Two strengthless Doves will draw me thro the Sky From Morn till Night, even where I list to sport me. Is Love so light, sweet Boy, and may it be That thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee? Is thine own Heart to thine own Face affected? Can thy right Hand seize Love upon thy left? Then woo thy self, be of thy self rejected, Steal thine one Freedom, and complain of Theft. Narcissus so himself, himself forsook, And died to kiss his Shadow in the Brook. Torches are made to light, Jewels to wear, Dainties to tast, fresh Beauty for the Use, Herbs for their Smell, and sappy Plants to bear: Things growing to themselves are growth's Abuse. Seeds spring from Seeds, and Beauty breedeth Beauty, Thou wert begot, to get it is thy Duty. Upon the Earth's Increase why shouldst thou feed, Unless the Earth with thy Increase be fed? By Law of Nature thou art bound to breed, That thine may live, when thou thy self art dead: And so in spight of Death thou dost survive, In that thy Likeness still is left alive. By this, the Love-sick Queen began to sweat; For where they lay, the shadow had forsook them; And Titan tired in the mid-day Heat, With burning Eye, did hotly overlook them, Wishing Adonis had his Team to guide, So he were like him and by Venus side. And now Adonis with a lazy spright, And with a heavy dark disliking Eye, His lowring Brows o'erwhelming his fair Sight, Like misty Vapours, when they blot the Sky, Souring his Cheeks, crys Fy, no more of Love, The Sun doth burn my Face, I must remove. Ah me (quoth Venus) young and so unkind? What bare Excuses mak'st thou to be gone? I'll sigh Celestial Breath, whose gentle Wind Shall cool the Heat of this descending Sun. I'll make a Shadow for thee of my Hairs; If they burn too, I'll quench them with my Tears. The Sun that shines from Heaven shines but warm, And lo, I lie between the Sun and thee; The Heat I have from thence doth little harm, Thine Eye darts forth the Fire that burneth me. And were I not immortal, Life were done Between this Heavenly and Earthly Sun. Art thou obdurate, flinty, hard as Steel? Nay more than Flint, for Stone at Rain relenteth. Art thou a Woman's Son, and canst not feel What 'tis to love, how want of Love tormenteth? O had thy Mother born so bad a Mind, She had not brought forth thee, but died unkind. What am I that thou shouldst contemn me this? Or what great Danger dwells upon my Suit? What were thy Lips the worse for one poor Kiss? Speak fair: but speak fair Words, or else be mute. Give me one Kiss, I'll give it thee again, And one for Int'rest, if thou wilt have twain. Fy, lifeless Picture, cold and senseless Stone, Well painted Idol, Image dull and dead, Statue contenting but the Eye alone; Thing like a Man, but of no Woman bred: Thou art no Man tho of a Man's Complexion, For Men will kiss e'en by their own Direction. This said, Impatience chokes her pleading Tongue, And swelling Passion doth provoke a Pause, Red Cheeks and fiery Eyes blaze forth her Wrong; Being Judg in Love, she cannot right her Cause. And now she weeps, and now she fain would speak, And now her Sobs do her Intendments break. Sometimes she shakes her Head, and then his Hand; Now gazeth she on him, now on the Ground: Sometimes her Arms infold him like a Band; She would, he will not in her Arms be bound: And when from thence he struggles to be gone, She locks her Lilly Fingers one in one. Fondling, saith she, since I have hemm'd thee here Within the Circuit of this Ivory Pale, I'll be the Park, and thou shalt be my Deer, Feed where thou wilt on Mountain or in Dale; Graze on my Lips, and if those Hills be dry, Stray lower, where the pleasant Fountains lie. Within this Limit is Relief enough, Sweet bottom Grass, and high delightful Plain, Round rising Hillocks, Brakes obscure and rough, To shelter thee from Tempest and from Rain: Then be me Deer, since I am such a Park, No Dog shall rouze thee, tho a thousand bark. At this Adonis smiles as in Disdain, That in each Cheek appears a pretty dimple, Love made those Hollows: if himself were slain, He might be buried in a Tomb so simple: Fore-knowing well if there he came to lie, Why there Love liv'd, and there he could not die. These loving Caves, these round inchanting Pits, Open their Mouths to swallow Venus liking: Being mad before, how doth she now for Wits? Stroke dead at first, what needs a second striking? Poor Queen of Love, in thine own Law forlorn, To love a Cheek that smiles at thee with Scorn! Now which way shall she turn? what shall she say? Her Words are done, her Woes the more increasing: The time is spent, her Object will away, And from her twining Arms doth urge releasing: Pity she cries, some Favour, some Remorse: Away he springs, and hasteth to his Horse. But lo, from forth a Copps that neighbours by, A breeding Jennet, lusty, young, and proud, Adonis trampling Coarser doth espy; And forth she rushes, snorts, and neighs aloud: The strong-neckt Steed being tied unto a Tree, Breaketh his Rein, and to her straight goes he. Imperiously he leaps, he neighs, he bounds: And now his woven Girts he breaks asunder, The bearing Earth with his hard Hoof he wounds, Whose hollow Womb resounds like Heaven's Thunder: The Iron Bit he crushes 'tween his Teeth, Controlling what he was controlled with. His Ears up prick't his braided hanging Mane, Upon his compast Crest now stands an end, His Nostrils drink the Air, and forth again As from a Furnace Vapours doth he lend: His Eye, which scornfully glisters like Fire, Shews his hot Courage, and his high Desire. Sometimes he trots as if he told the steps, With gentle Majesty, and modest Pride: Anon he rears upright, curvets and leaps; As who should say, Lo, thus my strength is tried. And thus I do to captivate the Eye Of the fair Breeder that is standing by, What recketh he his Rider's angry stur, His flatt'ring Holla, or his Stand, I say? What cares he now for Curb, or pricking Spur, For rich Caparisons, or Trappings gay? He sees his Love, and nothing else he sees: For nothing else with his proud sight agrees. Look when a Painter would surpass the Life, In limning out a well-proportion'd Steed, His Art with Nature's Workmanship at strife, As if the dead the living should exceed: So did his Horse excel a common one, In Shape, in Courage, Colour, Pace, and Bone. Round hooft, short jointed, Fetlocks shag and long, Broad Breast, full Eyes, small Head, and Nostril wide, High Crest, short Ears, strait Legs, and passing strong, Thin Mane, thick Tail, broad Buttock, tender Hide: Look what a Horse should have he did not lack, Save a proud Rider on so proud a Back. Sometimes he scuds far off, and there he stares; Anon he starts at stirring of a Feather: To bid the Wind abase he now prepares, And where he run, or fly, they know not whether. For thro his Main and Tail the high Wind sings, Fanning the Hairs, who have like feather'd Wings. He looks upon his Love, and neighs unto her: She answers him, as if she knew his Mind: Being proud, as Females are, to see him woo her, She puts on outward strangeness, seems unkind, Spurns at his Love, and scorns the Heat he feels, Beating his kind Embracements with his Heels. Then, like a melancholy Male-content, He vails his Tail: that, like a falling Plume, Cool shadow to his melting Buttocks lent, He stamps, and bites the poor Flies in his Fume. His Love perceiving how he is inrag'd, Grew kinder, and his Fury was asswag'd. His testy Master goes about to take him, When lo, the unbackt Breeder, full of fear, Jealous of catching, swiftly doth forsake him, With her the Horse, and left Adonis there; As they were mad, unto the Wood they hie them, Out-stripping Crows that strive to over-fly them. All swoln with chasing, down Adonis sits, Banning his boistrous and unruly Beast: And now the happy Season once more fits, That Love-sick Love by pleading may be blest. For Lovers say, the Heart hath treble wrong, When it is bar'd the Aidance of the Tongue. An Oven that is stopt, or River staid, Burneth more hotly, swelleth with more rage: So of concealed Sorrow may be said; Free vent of Words Love's Fire doth asswage: But when the Heart's Attorney once is mute, The Client breaks, as desperate in his Suit. He sees her coming, and begins to glow, E'en as a dying Coal revives with Wind, And with his Bonnet hides his angry Brow, Looks on the dull Earth with disturbed Mind; Taking no notice that she is so nigh, For all ascance he holds her in his Eye. O what a sight it was wistly to view, How she came stealing to the wayward Boy! To note the fighting Conflict of her hiew, How white and red each other did destroy: But now her Cheek was pale, and by and by It flasht forth Fire, as Lightning from the Sky. Now was she just before him as he sat, And like a lowly Lover down she kneels; With one fair Hand she heaveth up his Hat, Her other tender Hand his fair Cheeks feels: His tender Cheeks receive her soft hands print, As apt as new-fallen Snow takes any dint. O what a war of Looks was then between them? Her Eyes Petitioners to his Eyes suing; His Eyes saw her Eyes, as they had not seen them; Her Eyes woo'd still, his Eyes disdain'd the Wooing: And all this dumb play had his Acts made plain, With Tears which, Chorus like, her Eyes did rain. Full gently now she takes him by the Hand, A Lilly prison'd in a Jayl of Snow, Or Ivory in an Alabaster Band, So white a Friend ingirts so white a Foe: This beauteous Combat, wilful and unwilling, Shew'd like to silver Doves that sit a billing. Once more the Engine of her Thoughts began: O fairest mover on this mortal Round, Would thou wert as I am, and I a Man, My Heart all whole as thine, thy Heart my Wound: For one sweet Look my help I would assure thee, Tho nothing but my Body's Bane would cure thee. Give me my Hand (saith he) why dost thou feel it? Give me my Heart (saith she) and thou shalt have it. O give it me, lest thy hard Heart do steel it; And being steel'd, soft Sighs can never grave it: Then Love's deep Groans I never shall regard, Because Adonis Heart hath made mine hard. For shame, he crys, let go, and let me go, My days delight is past, my Horse is gone, And 'tis your Fault I am bereft him so, I pray you hence, and leave me here alone. For all my Mind, my Thought, my busy Care, Is how to get my Palfrey from the Mare. Thus she replys: Thy Palfrey, as he should, Welcomes the warm Approach of sweet Desire: Affection is a Coal that must be cool'd; Else, suffer'd, it will set the Heart on fire. The Sea hath Bounds, but deep Desire hath none, Therefore no marvel tho thy Horse be gone. How like a Jade he stood, ty'd to a Tree, Servilely master'd with a leathern Rein? But when he saw his Love, his Youth's fair Fee, He held such petty Bondage in disdain, Throwing the base Thong from his bending Crest, Enfranchising his Mouth, his Back, his Breast. Who sees his true Love in her naked Bed, Teaching the Sheets a whiter hiew than White; But when his glutton Eye so full hath fed, His other Agents aim at like Delight: Who is so faint that dare not be so bold, To touch the Fire, the Weather being cold? Let me excuse thy Courser, gentle Boy; And learn of him, I heartily beseech thee, To take Advantage on presented Joy; Tho I were dumb, yet his Proceedings teach thee. O learn to love, the Lesson is but plain, And once made perfect, never lost again. I know not Love (quoth he) nor will I know it, Unless it be a Boar, and then I chase it. 'Tis much to borrow, and I will not owe it; My Love to love, is Love but to disgrace it. For I have heard it is a Life in Death, That laughs, and weeps, and all but with a breath. Who wears a Garment shapeless and unfinish'd? Who plucks the Bud before one Leaf put forth? If springing things be any jot diminish'd, They wither in their prime, prove nothing worth: The Colt that's backt, and burden'd being young, Loseth his Pride, and never waxeth strong. You hurt my Hand with wringing: let us part, And leave this idle Theme, this bootless Chat; Remove your Siege from my unyielding Heart, To Love's Alarm it will not ope the Gate. Dismiss your Vows, your fained Tears, your Flattry; For where a Heart is hard, they make no Battry. What, canst thou talk (quoth she) hast thou a Tongue? O would thou hadst not, or I had no hearing; Thy Mermaid's Voice hath done me double wrong, I had my Load before, now prest with bearing; Melodious discord, heavenly tune harsh-sounding, Earth's deep sweet Musick, and Heart's deep sore wounding. Had I no Eyes but Ears, my Ears would love That inward Beauty, and invisible: Or were I deaf, thy outward Parts would move Each Part in me that were but sensible. Tho neither Eyes nor Ears to hear nor see, Yet should I be in Love by touching thee. Say that the Sense of Reason were bereft me, And that I could not see, nor hear, nor touch, And nothing but the very Smell were left me, Yet would my Love to thee be still as much: For from the Stillatory of thy Face excelling, Comes Breath perfum'd, that breedeth Love by smelling. But Oh, what Banquet wert thou to the Tast, Being nurse and feeder of the other four? Would they not wish the Feast should ever last, And bid Suspicion double-lock the Door? Lest Jealousy, that sour unwelcome Guest, Should by his stealing in disturb the Feast. Once more the ruby-colour'd Portal open'd, Which to his Speech did hony Passage yield: Like a red Morn that ever yet betoken'd Wrack to the Seamen, Tempest to the Field, Sorrow to Shepherds, Woe unto the Birds, Gust and foul Flaws to Hersdmen and to Herds. This ill Presage advisedly she marketh, Even as the Wind is hush'd before it raineth, Or as the Wolf doth grin before he barketh, Or as the Berry breaks before it staineth; Or like the deadly Bullet of a Gun, His meaning stroke her e'er his Words begun. And at his Look she flatly falleth down, For looks kill Love, and Love by looks reviveth: A Smile recures the wounding of a Frown, But blessed Bankrupt, that by Love so thriveth. The silly Boy believing she is dead, Claps her pale Cheek, till clapping makes it red. And in Amaze brake off his late Intent, For sharply he did think to reprehend her: Which cunning Love did wittily prevent, Fair fall the Wit that can so well defend her: For on the Grass she lies as she were slain, Till his Breath breathed Life in her again. He wrings her Nose, he strikes her on the Cheeks, He bends her Fingers, holds her Pulses hard, He chafes her Lips, a thousand ways he seeks To mend the Hurt that his Unkindness mar'd: He kisses her, and she, by her good Will, Will never rise, so he will kiss her still. The Night of Sorrow now is turn'd to Day, Her two blew Windows faintly she up heaveth: Like the fair Sun, when in his fresh Array He cheers the Morn, and all the World relieveth: And as the bright Sun glorifies the Sky, So is her Face illumin'd with her Eye. Whose Beams upon his hairless Face are fix'd, As if from thence they borrow'd all their Shine: Were never four such Lamps together mixt, Had not his clouded, with his Brows repine: But hers, which thro the Crystal tears gave light, Shone like the Moon in Water seen by Night. O where am I (quoth she) in Earth or Heaven, Or in the Ocean drencht, or in the Fire? What hour is this, or Morn, or weary Even? Do I delight to die, or Life desire? But now I liv'd, and Life was Death's Annoy: But now I dy'd, and Death was lively Joy. O thou didst kill me, kill me once again; Thy Eyes, shrewd Tutor, that hard Heart of thine, Hath taught them scornful tricks, and such disdain, That they have murdred this poor Heart of mine: And these mine Eyes, true Leaders to their Queen, But for thy piteous Lips no more had seen. Long may they kiss each other for this Cure: Oh never let their crimson Liveries wear! And as they last their Verdure still endure, To drive Infection from the dangerous Year; That the Star-gazers having writ on Death, May say, the Plague is banish'd by thy Breath. Pure Lips, sweet Seals, in my soft Lips imprinted, What Bargains may I make still to be sealing? To sell my self I can be well contented, So thou wilt buy, and pay, and use good dealing: Which Purchase if thou make, for fear of Slips, Set thy Seal Manual on my wax-red Lips. A thousand Kisses buy my Heart from me, And pay them at thy leisure one by one: What are ten hundred Kisses unto thee? Are they not quickly told, and quickly gone? Say for non-payment that the Debt should double, Are twenty hundred Kisses such a trouble? Fair Queen (quoth he) if any Love you owe me, Measure my Strangeness with my unripe Years; Before I know my self, seek not to know me; No Fisher but the ungrown Fry forbears: The mellow Plum doth fall, the green sticks fast, Or being early pluckt, is sour to tast. Look, the World's Comforter, with weary Gate, His day's hot Task hath ended in the West, The Owl (Night's Herald) shreeks, 'tis very late; The Sheep are gone to fold, Birds to their Nest. The coal-black Clouds that shadow Heavens Light, Do summon us to part, and bid good Night. Now let me say good Night, and so say you; If you will say so, you shall have a Kiss. Good Night (quoth she) and e're he says adieu, The hony Fee of parting tendred is: Her Arms do lend his Neck a sweet imbrace, Incorporate then they seem, face grows to face. Till breathless he dis-joyn'd, and backward drew The heavenly Moisture, that sweet coral Mouth, Whose precious Tast her thirsty Lips well knew, Whereon they surfeit, yet complain on Drouth, He with her Plenty prest, she faint with Dearth, Their Lips together glew'd fall to the Earth. Now quick Desire hath caught her yielding Prey, And glutton-like she feeds, yet never filleth; Her Lips are Conquerors, his Lips obey, Paying what Ransom the Insulter willeth, Whose Vultur Thought dos pitch the Prise so high, That she will draw his Lips rich Treasure dry. And having felt the Sweetness of the Spoil, With blindfold Fury she begins to forage; Her Face doth reek and smoak, her Blood doth boil, And careless Lust stirs up a desperate Courage: Planting Oblivion, beating Reason back, Forgetting Shame's pure Blush, and Honour's Wrack. Hot, faint, and weary, with her hard embracing, Like a wild Bird being tam'd with too much handling, Or as the fleet-foot Roe that's tir'd with chasing, Or like the froward Infant still'd with dandling; He now obeys, and now no more resisteth, While she takes all she can, not all she listeth. What Wax so frozen but dissolves with tempring, And yields at last to every light Impression? Things out of hope are compast oft with ventring, Chiefly in Love, whose leave exceeds Commission: Affection faints not like a palefac'd Coward, But then woos best, when most his choice is froward. When he did frown, O had she then gave over! Such Nectar from his Lips she had not suckt: Foul Words and Frowns must not repel a Lover; What tho the Rose have Pricks? yet it is pluckt. Were Beauty under twenty Locks kept fast, Yet Love breaks thro, and picks them all at last. For pity now she can no more detain him; The poor Fool prays her that he may depart: She is resolv'd no longer to restrain him; Bids him farewel, and look well to her Heart, The which, by Cupid's Bow she doth protest, He carries thence engaged in his Breast. Sweet Boy, she says, this Night I'll wast in Sorrow, For my sick Heart commands mine Eyes to watch. Tell me, Love's Master, shall we meet to morrow? Say, shall we, shall we, wilt thou make the Match? He tells her no, to morrow he intends To hunt the Boar with certain of his Friends. The Boar (quoth she) whereat a sudden Pale, Like Lawn, being spread upon the blushing Rose, Usurps her Cheeks; she trembles at his Tale, And on his Neck her yoking Arms she throws; She sinketh down, still hanging on his Neck, He on her Belly falls, she on her Back. Now is she in the very Lists of Love, Her Champion mounted for the hot Encounter: All is imaginary she doth prove, He will not manage her altho he mount her: That worse than Tantalus is her Annoy, To clip Elysium, and to lack her Joy. Even as poor Birds, deceiv'd with painted Grapes, Do surfeit by the Eye, and pine the Maw; Even so she languisheth in her Mishaps, As those poor Birds that helpless Berrys saw. The warm Effects which she in him finds missing, She seeks to kindle with continual kissing. But all in vain, good Queen, it will not be; She hath assay'd as much as may be prov'd, Her pleading hath deserv'd a greater Fee: She's Love, she loves, and yet she is not lov'd. Fie, fie, he says, you crush me, let me go, You have no reason to withhold me so. Thou hadst been gone, quoth she, sweet Boy, e'er this, But that thou toldst me thou wouldst hunt the Boar. O be advis'd, thou knowst not what it is, With Javelin's point a churlish Swine to gore, Whose Tushes never sheath'd, he whetteth still, Like to a mortal Butcher bent to kill. On his bow-back he hath a Battel set Of bristly Pikes, that ever threat his Foes; His Eyes, like Gloworms, shine when he doth fret, His Snout digs Sepulchres, where e'er he goes: Being mov'd, he strikes what e'er is in his way; And whom he strikes, his crooked Tushes slay. His brawny Sides with hairy Bristles armed, Are better proof than thy Spear's Point can enter; His short thick Neck cannot be easily harmed, Being ireful on the Lion he will venter: The thorny Brambles, and embracing Bushes, As fearful of him, part, thro whom he rushes. Alas, he nought esteems that Face of thine, To which Love's Eye pays tributary Gazes, Nor thy soft Hand, sweet Lips, and chrystal Eyne, Whose full Perfection all the World amazes; But having thee at vantage (wondrous dread!) Would root these Beauties as he roots the Mead. O let him keep his loathsom Cabin still; Beauty hath nought to do with such foul Fiends. Come not within his Danger by thy Will; They that thrive well take Counsel of their Friends. When thou didst name the Boar, not to dissemble, I feard thy Fortune, and my Joints did tremble. Didst thou not mark my Face? was it not White? Sawst thou not signs of Fear lurk in mine Eye? Grew I not faint? And fell I not down right? Within my Bosom, whereon thou dost lie, My boding Heart pants, beats, and takes no rest, But like an Earthquake shakes thee on my Breast. For where Love reigns, disturbing Jealousy Doth call himself Affection's Centinel, Gives false Alarms, suggesteth Mutiny, And in a peaceful Hour doth cry, Kill, Kill; Distempring gentle Love with his desire, As Air and Water doth abate the Fire. This sour Informer, this bate-breeding Spy, This Canker that eats up Love's tender Spring, This Carry-tale, Dissension's Jealousy, That sometime true News, sometime false dos bring, Knocks at my Heart, and whispers in mine Ear, That if I love thee, I thy Death should fear: And more than so, presenteth to mine Eye The Picture of an angry chafing Boar, Under whose sharp Fangs, on his Back, doth lie An Image like thy self, all stain'd with Gore; Whose Blood upon the fresh Flowers being shed, Doth make them drop with Grief, and hang the Head. What should I do? seeing thee so indeed, That trembling at th'Imagination, The thought of it doth make my faint Heart bleed, And Fear doth teach it Divination: I prophesy thy Death, my living Sorrow, If thou encounter with the Boar to morrow. But if thou needs will hunt, be rul'd by me; Uncouple at the timorous flying Hare, Or at the Fox which lives by Subtilty; Or at the Roe which no Encounter dare: Pursue these fearful Creatures o'er the Downs, And on thy well-breath'd Horse keep with thy Hounds. And when thou hast on foot the purblind Hare, Mark the poor Wretch, to overshut his Troubles, How he out-runs the Wind, and with what care He cranks and crosses with a thousand Doubles: The many umsits thro the which he goes, Are like a Labyrinth t'amaze his Foes. Sometime he runs among the flock of Sheep, To make the cunning Hounds mistake their Smell, And sometime where Earth-delving Conies keep, To stop the loud Pursuers in their Yell; And sometime sorteth with a Herd of Deer: Danger deviseth shifts, Wit waits on Fear. For there his Smell with others being mingled, The hot-scent-snuffing Hounds are driven to doubt, Ceasing their clamorous Cry till they have singled With much ado the cold Fault cleanly out. Then do they spend their Mouths, Eccho replies, As if another Chase were in the Skies. By this, poor Wat far off upon a Hill Stands on his hinder Legs with listning Ear, To hearken if his Foes pursue him still: Anon their loud Alarums he doth hear. And now his Grief may be compared well To one sore sick, that hears the passing Bell. Then shalt thou see the dew-bedabbled Wretch Turn, and return, indenting with the Way: Each envious Brier his weary Legs doth scratch, Each Shadow makes him stop, each Murmur stay. For Misery is trodden on by many; And being low, never reliev'd by any. Lie quietly, and hear a little more, Nay do not struggle, for thou shalt not rise: To make thee hate the hunting of the Boar, Unlike my self, thou hear'st me moralize, Applying this to that, and so to so; For Love can comment upon every Woe. Where did I leave? No matter where (quoth he) Leave me, and then the Story aptly ends: The Night is spent. Why, what of that (quoth she) I am (quoth he) expected of my Friends; And now 'tis dark, and going I shall fall: In Night (quoth she) Desire sees best of all. But if thou fall, Oh, then imagine this, The Earth in love with thee, thy footing trips, And all is but to rob thee of a Kiss. Rich Preys make rich Men Thieves: so do thy Lips Make modest Diane cloudy and forlorn, Lest she should steal a Kiss and die forsworn. Now of this dark Night I perceive the reason, Cynthia for shame obscures her silver Shine, Till forging Nature be condemn'd of Treason, For stealing Moulds from Heaven that were Divine, Wherein she fram'd thee in high Heaven's despite, To shame the Sun by Day, and her by Night. And therefore hath she brib'd the Destinies, To cross the curious Workmanship of Nature, To mingle Beauty with Infirmities, And pure Perfection with impure Defeature, Making it subject to the Tyranny Of sad Mischances and much Misery; As burning Fevers, Agues pale and faint, Life-poisoning Pestilence, and Frenzy's Wood, The marrow-eating Sickness, whose Attaint Disorder breeds by beating of the Blood: Surfeits, Imposthumes, Grief, and damn'd Despair, Swear Nature's Death for framing thee so fair. And not the least of all these Maladies, But in one Minute's sight brings Beauty under: Both Favour, Savour, Hiew and Qualities, Whereat th'Imperial Gazer late did wonder, Are on the sudden wasted, thaw'd and done, As mountain Snow melts with the mid-day Sun. Therefore, despight of fruitless Chastity, Love-lacking Vestals, and self-loving Nuns, That on the Earth would breed a Scarcity, And barren dearth of Daughters and of Sons, Be prodigal: the Lamp that burns by Night, Dries up his Oil to lend the World his Light. What is thy Body but a swallowing Grave, Seeming to bury that Posterity, Which by the Rights of Time thou needs must have, If thou destroy them not in their obscurity? If so, the World will hold thee in disdain, Sith in thy Pride so fair a Hope is slain. So in thy self thy self art made away, A Mischief worse than civil home-bred Strife, Or theirs whose desperate Hands themselves do slay, Or Butcher's Sire that reaves his Son of Life. Foul cankering Rust the hidden Treasure frets, But Gold that's put to use more Gold begets. Nay then, quoth Adon, you will fall again Into your idle over-handled Theam; The Kiss I gave you is bestow'd in vain, And all in vain you strive against the Stream, For by this black-fac'd Night, Desire's foul Nurse, Your Treaty makes me like you worse and worse. If Love hath lent you twenty thousand Tongues, And every Tongue more moving than your own, Bewitching like the wanton Mermaid's Songs, Yet from mine Ear the tempting Tune is blown. For know, my Heart stands armed in my Ear, And will not let a false Sound enter there: Lest the deceiving Harmony should run Into the quiet closure of my Breast, And then my little Heart were quite undone, In his Bed-chamber to be bar'd of rest. No Lady, no: my Heart longs not to groan, But soundly sleeps, while now it sleeps alone. What have you urg'd that I cannot reprove? The Path is smooth that leadeth unto Danger; I hate not Love, but your Device in Love, That lends Imbracements unto every Stranger. You do it for Increase: O strange Excuse! When Reason is the Bawd to Lust's Abuse. Call it not Love, for Love to Heaven is fled, Since sweating Lust on Earth usurps his Name; Under whose simple Semblance he hath fed Upon fresh Beauty, blotting it with blame; Which the hot Tyrant stains, and soon bereaves, As Caterpillars do the tender Leaves. Love comforteth like Sun-shine after Rain: But Lust's Effect is Tempest after Sun. Love's gentle Spring doth always fresh remain: Lust's Winter comes, e'er Summer half be done. Love surfeits not: Lust like a Glutton dies. Love is all Truth: Lust full of forged Lies. More I could tell, but more I dare not say; The Text is old, the Orator too green; Therefore in sadness now I will away, My Face is full of Shame, my Heart of Teen; My Ears that to your wanton Calls attended, Do burn themselves for having so offended. With this he breaketh from the sweet Imbrace Of those fair Arms which bound him to her Breast; And homeward thro the dark Lanes runs apace, Leaves Love upon her Back deeply distrest. Look how a bright Star shooteth from the Sky, So glides he in the Night from Venus Eye. Which after him she darts as one on Shore, Gazing upon a late imbarked Friend, Till the wild Waves will have him seen no more, Whose Ridges with the meeting Clouds contend: So did the merciless and pitchy Night Fold in the Object that did feed her Sight. Whereat amaz'd, as one that unaware Hath drop'd a precious Jewel in the Flood, Or 'stonish'd as Night-wanderers often are, Their Light blown out in some mistrustful Wood: Even so confounded in the Dark she lay, Having lost the fair discovery of her Way. And now she beats her Heart, whereat it groans, That all the Neighbour-caves, as seeming troubled, Make verbal repetition of her Moans; Passion, on Passion, deeply is redoubled: Ah me, she crys, and twenty times Wo, Wo, And twenty Ecchoes twenty times cry so. She marking them, begins a wailing Note; And sings extempore a woful Ditty, How Love makes young Men thrall, and old Men dote, How Love is wise in Folly, foolish witty: Her heavy Anthem still concludes in Wo, And still the Quire of Ecchoes answers so. Her Song was tedious, and out-wore the Night, For Lovers hours are long, tho seeming short: It pleas'd themselves, others they think delight In such-like Circumstance, with such-like Sport. Their copious Stories, oftentimes begun, End without Audience, and are never done. For who hath she to spend the Night withal But idle Sounds, resembling Parasites, Like shrill-tongu'd Tapsters answering every Call, Soothing the Humour of fantastick Wits? She said, 'tis so: they answer all, 'tis so; And would say after her, if she said No. Lo here the gentle Lark, weary of rest, From his moist Cabinet mounts up on high, And wakes the Morning, from whose silver Breast The Sun ariseth in his Majesty: Who doth the World so gloriously behold, The Cedar Tops and Hills seem burnisht Gold. Venus salutes him with this fair good Morrow: O thou clear God, and Patron of all Light, From whom each Lamp and shining Star dos borrow The beauteous Influence that makes him bright; There lives a Son, that suckt an earthly Mother, May lend thee Light, as thou dost lend to other. This said, she hasteth to a myrtle Grove, Musing the Morning is so much o'er-worn; And yet she hears no Tidings of her Love, She hearkens for his Hounds, and for his Horn: Anon she hears them chaunt it lustily, And all in hast she coasteth to the Cry. And as she runs, the Bushes in the way, Some catch her by the Neck, some kiss her Face, Some twine about her Thigh to make her stay; She wildly breaketh from their strict Embrace, Like a milch Dow, whose swelling Dugs do ake, Hasting to feed her Fawn hid in some Brake. By this she hears the Hounds are at a Bay, Whereat she starts like one that spys an Adder, Wreath'd up in fatal Folds just in his way, The Fear whereof doth make him shake &amp; shudder: Even so the timorous yelping of the Hounds Appales her Senses, and her Spirit confounds. For now she knows it is no gentle Chase, But the blunt Boar, rough Bear, or Lion proud: Because the Cry remaineth in one Place, Where fearfully the Dogs exclaim aloud: Finding their Enemy to be so curst, They all strain Court'sy who shall cope him first. This dismal Cry rings sadly in her Ear, Thro which it enters to surprise her Heart: Who overcome by Doubt and bloodless Fear, With cool pale Weakness nums each feeling part: Like Soldiers when their Captain once doth yield, They basely fly, and dare not stay the Field. Thus stands she in a trembling Extasy, Till cheering up her Senses sore dismaid, She tells them 'tis a causeless Fantasy, And childish Error that they are afraid, Bids them leave quaking, wills them fear no more; And with that Word she spied the hunted Boar: Whose frothy Mouth bepainted all with red, Like Milk and Blood being mingled both together, A second Fear thro all her Sinews spred, Which madly hurries her she knows not whither: This way she runs, and now she will no further, But back retires to rate the Boar for Murder. A thousand Spleens bear her a thousand ways, She treads the Paths that she untreads again; Her more than Hast is marred with Delays, Like the Proceedings of a drunken Brain, Full of respect, yet not at all respecting; In hand with all things, nought at all affecting. Here kennel'd in a Brake she finds an Hound, And asks the weary Caitif for his Master, And there another licking of his Wound, 'Gainst venom'd Sores the only Sovereign Plaister; And here she meets another sadly scolding, To whom she speaks, and he replies with howling. When he had ceas'd his ill-resounding Noise, Another flat-mouth'd Mourner black and grim, Against the Welkin vollies out his Voice; Another and another answer him, Clapping their proud Tails to the ground below, Shaking their scratcht Ears, bleeding as they go. Look how the World's poor People are amaz'd At Apparitions, Signs, and Prodigies, Whereon with fearful Eyes they long have gaz'd, Infusing them with dreadful Prophecies; So she, at these sad Signs, draws up her Breath, And, sighing it again, exclaims on Death. Hard-favour'd Tyrant, ugly, meagre, lean, Hateful Divorce of Love (thus chides she Death) Grim-grinning Ghost, Earth's Worm, what dost thou mean, To stifle Beauty, and to steal his Breath? Who when he liv'd, his Breath and Beauty set Gloss on the Rose, Smell to the Violet. If he be dead, O no; it cannot be, Seeing his Beauty, thou shouldst strike at it. O yes, it may: thou hast no Eyes to see, But hatefully at random dost thou hit. Thy mark is feeble Age; but thy false Dart Mistakes that Aim, and cleaves an Infant's Heart. Hadst thou but bid beware, then he had spoke, And hearing him, thy Power had lost his Power: The Destinies will curse thee for this stroke, They bid thee crop a Weed, thou pluckst a Flower: Love's golden Arrow at him should have fled, And not Death's Ebon Dart to strike him dead. Dost thou drink Tears, that thou provok'st such weeping? What may a heavy Groan advantage thee? Why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping Those Eyes that taught all other Eyes to see? Now Nature cares not for thy mortal Vigor, Since her best Work is ruin'd with thy Rigor. Here overcome, as one full of Despair, She veil'd her Eye-Lids, who like Sluces stopt The cristal Tide, that from her two Cheeks fair, In the sweet Channel of her Bosom dropt. But thro the Flood-gates breaks the silver Rain, And with his strong Course opens them again. O how her Eyes and Tears did lend and borrow! Her Eyes seen in her Tears, Tears in her Eye, Both Cristals, where they view'd each others Sorrow, Sorrow, that friendly Sighs sought still to dry; But like a Stormy day, now Wind, now Rain, Sighs dry her Cheeks, Tears make them wet again. Variable Passions throng her constant Woe, As striving which should best become her Grief; All entertain'd, each Passion labours so, That every present Sorrow seemeth Chief: But none is best, then join they altogether, Like many Clouds consulting for foul Weather. By this, far oft, she hears some Huntsman hollow; A Nurse's Song ne'er pleas'd her Babe so well: The dire Imagination she did follow, This sound of Hope doth labour to expel: For now reviving Joy bids her rejoice, And flatters her, it is Adonis Voice. Whereat her Tears began to turn their Tide, Being prison'd in her Eye, like Pearls in Glass: Yet sometimes falls an Orient Drop beside, Which her Cheek melts, as scorning it should pass To wash the foul Face of the sluttish ground, Who is but drunken when she seemeth drown'd. O hard-believing Love, how strange it seems Not to believe, and yet too credulous! Thy Weal and Woe are both of them Extreams, Despair and Hope make thee ridiculous: The one doth flatter thee in Thoughts unlikely, With likely Thoughts the other kills thee quickly. Now she unweaves the Web that she had wrought, Adonis lives; and Death is not to blame: It was not she that call'd him all to nought, Now she adds Honour to his hateful Name, She cleeps him King of Graves, and Grave for Kings, Imperial Supreme of all mortal things. No, no (quoth she) sweet Death, I did but jest; Yet pardon me, I felt a kind of Fear, Whenas I met the Boar, that bloody Beast, Which knows no pity, but is still severe: Then gentle Shadow (Truth I must confess) I rail'd on thee, fearing my Love's Decease. 'Tis not my Fault; the Boar provok'd my Tongue, Be wreak'd on him (invisible Commander) 'Tis he, foul Creature, that hath done thee wrong; I did but act, he's Author of thy Slander. Grief hath two Tongues, and never Woman yet Could rule them both without ten Womens Wit. Thus hoping that Adonis is alive, Her rash suspect she doth extenuate: And that his Beauty may the better thrive, With Death she humbly doth insinuate; Tells him of Trophies, Statues, Tombs, and Stories, His Victories, his Triumphs, and his Glories. O Jove, quoth she, how much a Fool was I, To be of such a weak and silly Mind, To wail his Death who lives, and must not die, Till mutual overthrow of mortal kind! For he being dead, with him is Beauty slain; And Beauty dead, black Chaos comes again. Fie, fie, fond Love, thou art so full of Fear, As one with Treasure laden, hem'd with Thieves: Trifles (unwitnessed with Eye or Ear) Thy Coward Heart with false bethinking grieves: Even at this Word she hears a merry Horn, Whereat she leaps that was but late forlorn. As Faulcon to the lure, away she flies: The Grass stoops not, she treads on it so light, And in her hast unfortunately spies The foul Boar's Conquest on her fair Delight. Which seen, her Eyes, as murder'd with the view, Like Stars, asham'd of Day, themselves withdrew. Or, as the Snail, whose tender Horns being hit, Shrinks backward in his shelly Cave with Pain; And there, all smother'd up, in shade doth sit, Long after fearing to creep forth again: So, at his bloody view her Eyes are fled Into the deep dark Cabins of her Head; Where they resign'd their Office and their Light To the disposing of her troubled Brain: Who bids them still consort with ugly Night, And never wound the Heart with Looks again; Who like a King perplexed in his Throne, By their Suggestions gives a deadly Groan, Whereat each tributary Subject quakes, As when the Wind imprison'd in the Ground, Strugling for Passage, Earth's Foundation shakes, Which with cold Terrors doth Mens Minds confound. This Mutiny each Part doth so surprise, That from their dark Beds, once more, leap her Eyes. And, being open'd, threw unwilling Sight Upon the wide Wound that the Boar had trencht In his soft Flank; whose wonted Lilly white With purple tears, that his wound wept, was drencht No Flower was nigh, no Grass, Herb, Leaf or Weed But stole his Blood, and seem'd with him to bleed This solemn Sympathy poor Venus noteth, Over one Shoulder doth she hang her Head, Dumbly she passions, frantickly she doteth, She thinks he could not die, he is not dead: Her Voice is stopt, her Joints forget to bow, Her Eyes are mad that they have wept till now. Upon his Hurt she looks so stedfastly, That her sight dazling, makes the Wound seem three, And then she reprehends her mangling Eye, That makes more Gashes where no Breach should be: His Face seems twain, each several Limb is doubled, For oft the Eye mistakes, the Brain being troubled. My Tongue cannot express my Grief for one; And yet (quoth she) behold two Adons dead: My Sighs are blown away, my salt Tearts gone; Mine Eyes are turn'd to Fire, my Heart to Lead. Heavy Hearts Lead melt at mine Eyes as Fire, So shall I die by Drops of hot Desire. Alas, poor World, what Treasure hast thou lost? What Face remains alive that's worth the viewing? Whose Tongue is Musick now? what canst thou boast Of Things long since, or any thing ensuing? The Flowers are sweet, their Colours fresh &amp; trim: But true sweet Beauty liv'd and dy'd in him. Bonnet or Veil, henceforth no Creature wear; Nor Sun, nor Wind, will ever strive to kiss you: Having no Fair to lose, you need not fear; The Sun doth scorn you, &amp; the Wind doth hiss you: But when Adonis liv'd, Sun and sharp Air Lurkt like two Thieves to rob him of his Fair. And therefore would he put his Bonnet on, Under whose Brim the gawdy Sun would peep; The Wind would blow it off, and being gone, Play with his Locks, then would Adonis weep: And strait in pity of his tender Years, They both would strive who first should dry his tears. To see his Face, the Lion walks along Behind some Hedg, because he would not fear him: To recreate himself when he hath sung, The Tygre would be tame, and gently hear him: If he had spoke, the Wolf would leave his Prey, And never fright the silly Lamb that day. When he beheld his Shadow in a Brook, There Fishes spread on it their golden Gills: When he was by, the Birds such pleasure took, That some would sing, some other in their Bills Would bring him Mulberries, &amp; ripe red Cherries: He fed them with his Sight, they him with Berries. But this foul, grim, and urchin snouted Boar, Whose downward Eye still looketh for a Grave, Ne'er saw the beauteous Livery that he wore; Witness the Entertainment that he gave: If he did see his Face, why then, I know, He thought to kiss him, and hath kill'd him so. 'Tis true, true, true, thus was Adonis slain, He ran upon the Boar with his sharp Spear, Who would not whet his Teeth at him again; But, by a Kiss, thought to persuade him there: And, nousling in his Flank, the loving Swine Sheath'd, unaware, his Tusk in his soft Groin. Had I been tooth'd like him, I must confess, With kissing him, I should have kill'd him first; But he is dead, and never did he bless My Mouth with his, the more I am accurst: With this she falleth in the place she stood, And stains her Face with his congealed Blood. She looks upon his Lips, and they are pale; She takes him by the Hand, and that is cold; She whispers in his Ear a heavy Tale, As if he heard the woful Words she told: She lifts the Coffer-lids that close his Eyes, Where lo, two Lamps burnt out in darkness lies; Two Glasses, where her self her self beheld A thousand times, and now no more reflect, Their Virtue lost, wherein they late excell'd, And every Beauty rob'd of his Effect: Wonder of Time, quoth she, this is my Spight, That, you being dead, the Day should yet be Light. Since thou art dead, lo here I prophesy, Sorrow on Love hereafter shall attend: It shall be waited on with Jealousy, Find sweet Beginning, but unsavoury End; Ne'er settled equally, too high, or low, That all Love's Pleasures shall not match his Wo. It shall be fickle, false, and full of Fraud, And shall be blasted in a breathing while, The bottom Poison, and the top o'er-straw'd With Sweets, that shall the sharpest sight beguile. The strongest Body shall it make most weak, Strike the Wise dumb, and teach the Fool to speak. It shall be sparing, and too full of Riot, Teaching decrepit Age to tread the Measures; The staring Ruffian shall it keep in quiet, Pluck down the Rich, inrich the Poor with Treasures. It shall be raging mad, and silly mild, Make the Young old, the Old become a Child. It shall suspect, where is no cause of fear; It shall not fear, where it shall most mistrust; It shall be merciful, and too severe, And most deceiving, when it seems most just: Perverse it shall be when it seems most toward, Put Fear to Valour, Courage to the Coward. It shall be cause of War, and dire Events, And set Dissension 'twixt the Son and Sire, Subject and servile to all Discontents, As dry combustious Matter is to Fire: Sith in his Prime, Death doth my Love destroy, They that love best their Love shall not enjoy. By this, the Boy that by her side lay kill'd, Was melted like a Vapour from her sight, And in his Blood that on the Ground lay spil'd, A purple Flower sprung up checker'd with white, Resembling well his pale Cheeks, and the Blood, Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood. She bows her Head, the new-sprung Flower to smell, Comparing it to her Adonis Breath; And says, within her Bosom it shall dwell, Since he himself is reft from her by death: She crops the Stalk, and in the breach appears Green dropping Sap, which she compares to Tears. Poor Flower, quoth she, this was thy Father's Guise, (Sweet Issue of a more sweet-smelling Sire) For every little Grief to wet his Eyes, To grow unto himself was his desire; And so 'tis thine: but know, it is as good To wither in my Breast, as in his Blood. Here was thy Father's Bed, here is my Breast, Thou art the next of Blood, and 'tis thy Right: Lo, in this hollow Cradle take thy rest, My thrubbing Heart shall rock thee Day and Night: There shall not be one minute of an Hour, Wherein I will not kiss my sweet Love's Flower. Thus weary of the World, away she hies, And yokes her silver Doves, by whose swift Aid Their Mistress mounted, thro the empty Skies In her light Chariot quickly is convey'd, Holding their Course to Paphos, where their Queen Means to immure her self, and not be seen. The first Anniversary of the Government under his Highness the Lord Protector suppos'd to be written by Edmond Waller of Becconsfield Esq; and printed in 1655. Like the vain Curlings of the watry Maze, Which in smooth Streams a sinking Weight dos raise; So Man, declining always, disappears In the weak Circles of increasing Years; And his short Tumults of themselves compose, While flowing Time above his Head dos close. Cromwel alone with greater Vigour runs (Sun-like) the Stages of succeeding Suns: And still the Day which he doth next restore, Is the just Wonder of the Day before. Cromwel alone doth with new Lustre spring, And shines the Jewel of the yearly Ring. 'Tis he the Force of scatter'd Time contracts, And in one Year the Work of Ages acts: While heavy Monarchs make a wide Return, Longer, and more Malignant than Saturn; And tho they all Platonick Years should reign, In the same Posture would be found again. Their earthy Projects under ground they lay, More slow and brittle than the China Clay: Well may they strive to leave them to their Son, For one Thing never was by one King done. Yet some more active for a Frontier Town Took in by Proxy, begs a false Renown; Another triumphs at the Publick Cost, And will have won, if he no more lost; They fight by Others, but in Person wrong, And only are against their Subjects strong; Their other Wars seem but a feign'd Contest, This Common Enemy is still opprest. If Conquerors, on them they turn their Might; If Conquered, on them they wreak their Spight: They neither build the Temple in their days, Nor Matter for succeeding Founders raise; Nor sacred Prophecies consult within, Much less themselves to perfect them begin: No other Care they bear of Things above, But with Astrologers Divine, and Jove, To know how long their Planet yet reprieves From the deserved Fate their guilty Lives. Thus (Image-like) an useless time they tell, And with vain Scepter strike the hourly Bell; Nor more contribute to the state of Things, Than wooden Heads unto the Viol's Strings. While indefatigable Cromwel hies, And cuts his way still nearer to the Skies, Learning a Musick in the Region clear, To tune this lower to that higher Sphere. So when Amphion did the Lute command, Which the God gave him, with his gentle hand; The rougher Stones, unto his Measures hew'd, Danc'd up in order from the Quarrys rude; This took a lower, that a higher Place, As he the Treble alter'd, or the Base: No Note he struck, but a new Story lay'd, And the great Work ascended while he play'd. The listning Structures he with Wonder ey'd, And still new Stops to various Time apply'd: Now thro the Strings a martial Rage he throws, And joining straight the Theban Tow'r arose; Then as he strokes them with a Touch more sweet, The flocking Marbles in a Palace meet; But, for the most he graver Notes did try, Therefore the Temples rear'd their Columns high. Thus, e'er he ceas'd, his Sacred Lute creates Th'harmonious City of the seven Gates. Such was that wond'rous Order and Consent, When Cromwel tun'd the ruling Instrument; While tedious Statesmen many Years did hack, Framing a Liberty that still went back; Whose num'rous Gorge could swallow in an Hour That Island, which the Sea cannot devour: Then our Amphion issues out and sings, And once he struck, and twice, the pow'rful Strings. The Commonwealth then first together came, And each one enter'd in the willing Frame: All other Matter yields, and may be rul'd; But who the Minds of stubborn Men can build? No Quarry bears a Stone so hardly wrought, Nor with such labour from its Center brought; None to be sunk in the Foundation bends, Each in the House the highest Place contends, And each the Hand that lays him will direct, And some fall back upon the Architect; Yet all compos'd by his attractive Song, Into the animated City throng. The Commonwealth dos thro their Centers all Draw the Circumfrence of the publick Wall; The crossest Spirits here do take their part, Fastning the Contignation which they thwart; And they, whose Nature leads them to divide, Uphold, this one, and that the other Side; But the most equal still sustain the Height, And they as Pillars keep the Work upright; While the Resistance of opposed Minds, The Fabrick as with Arches stronger binds, Which on the Basis of a Senate free, Knit by the Roof's protecting Weight agree. When for his Foot he thus a place had found, He hurls e'er since the World about him round; And in his sev'ral Aspects, like a Star, Here shines in Peace, and thither shoots a War. While by his Beams observing Princes steer, And wisely court the Influence they fear: O would they rather, by his Pattern won, Kiss the approaching, nor yet angry Son; And in their numbred Footsteps humbly tread The Path where holy Oracles do lead! How might they under such a Captain raise The great Designs kept for the latter Days? But mad with Reason, so miscall'd, of State, They know them not, and what they know not hate. Hence still they sing Hosanna to the Whore, And her whom they should massacre adore: But Indians whom they should convert, subdue; Nor teach, but traffick with, or burn the Jew. Unhappy Princes, ignorantly bred, By Malice some, by Error more misled! If gracious Heaven to my Life give length, Leisure to Time, and to my Weakness Strength, Then shall I once with graver Accents shake Your Regal Sloth, and your long Slumbers wake: Like the shrill Huntsman that prevents the East, Winding his Horn to Kings that chase the Beast. Till then my Muse shall hollow far behind Angelick Cromwel, who out-wings the Wind; And in dark Nights, and in cold Days alone, Pursues the Monster thorow every Throne: Which shrinking to her Roman Den impure, Gnashes her goary Teeth; nor there secure. Hence oft I think, if in some happy Hour High Grace should meet in one with highest Pow'r; And then a seasonable People still Should bend to his, as he to Heaven's will; What we might hope, what wonderful Effect From such a wish'd Conjuncture might reflect! Sure, the mysterious Work, where none withstand, Would forthwith finish under such a Hand; Fore-shortned Time its useless course would stay, And soon precipitate the latest Day. But a thick Cloud about that Morning lies, And intercepts the Beams of mortal Eyes; That 'tis the most which we determine can, If these the Times, then This must be the Man. And well he therefore dos, and well has guest, Who in his Age has always forward prest: And knowing not where Heaven's Choice may light, Girds yet his Sword, and ready stands to fight. But Men, alas, as if they nothing car'd, Look on, all unconcern'd, or unprepar'd; And Stars still fall, and still the Dragon's Tail Swinges the Volumes of its horrid Flail. For the great Justice that did first suspend The World by Sin, does by the same extend. Hence that blest Day still counterpoised wastes, The Ill delaying, what th'Elected hastes; Hence landing Nature to new Seas is tost, And good Designs still with their Authors lost. And thou, great Cromwel, for whose happy Birth A Mold was chosen out of better Earth; Whose Saint-like Mother we did lately see Live out an Age, long as a Pedegree; That she might seem, could we the Fall dispute, T'have smelt the Blossom, and not eat the Fruit; Tho none dos of more lasting Parents grow, But never any did them Honour so; Tho thou thine Heart from Evil still unstain'd, And always hast thy Tongue from fraud refrain'd; Thou, who so oft thro Storms of thundring Lead Hast born securely thine undaunted Head, Thy Breast thro ponyarding Conspiracies, Drawn from the Sheath of lying Prophecies; The Proof beyond all other Force or Skill, Our Sins endanger, and shall one day kill. How near they fail'd, and in thy sudden Fall At once assay'd to overturn us all. Our brutish Fury strugling to be free, Hurry'd thy Horses while they hurry'd thee; When thou hadst almost quit thy mortal Cares, And soil'd in Dust thy Crown of Silver Hairs. Let this one Sorrow interweave among The other Glories of our yearly Song. Like skilful Looms which thro the costly Thred Of purling Ore, a shining Wave do shed: So shall the Tears we on past Grief employ, Still as they trickle, glitter in our Joy. So with more modesty we may be true, And speak as of the Dead the Praises due: While impious Men, deceiv'd with Pleasure short, On their own Hopes shall find the Fall retort. But the poor Beasts wanting their noble Guide, What could they more? shrunk guiltily aside. First winged Fear transports them far away, And leaden Sorrow then their flight did stay. See how they each his tow'ring Crest abate, And the green Grass, and their known Mangers hate; Nor thro wide Nostrils snuff the wanton Air, Nor their round Hoofs, or curled Manes compare; With wandring Eyes and restless Ears they stood, And with shrill Neighings ask'd him of the Wood. Thou Cromwel falling, not a stupid Tree, Or Rock so savage, but it mourn'd for Thee: And all about was heard a panick Groan, As if that Nature's self were overthrown. It seem'd the Earth did from the Center tear; It seem'd the Sun was fal'n out of the Sphere: Justice obstructed lay, and Reason fool'd; Courage disheartned, and Religion cool'd. A dismal Silence thro the Palace went, And then loud Shreeks the vaulted Marbles rent; Such as the dying Chorus sings by turns, And to deaf Seas, and ruthless Tempests mourns, When now they sink, and now the plundring Streams Break up each Deck, and rip the Oaken Seams. But Thee triumphant hence the fiery Car, And fiery Steeds had born out of the War From the low World, and thankless Men, above Unto the Kingdom blest of Peace and Love: We only mourn'd our selves in thine Ascent, Whom thou hadst left beneath with Mantle rent. For all delight of Life thou then didst lose, When to Command thou didst thy self depose; Resigning up thy Privacy so dear, To turn the headstrong Peoples Charioteer. For to be Cromwel was a greater thing, Than ought below, or yet above a King: Therefore thou rather didst thy Self depress, Yielding to Rule, because it made thee less. For, neither didst thou from the first apply Thy sober Spirit unto things too high, But in thine own Field exercisedst long An healthful Mind within a Body strong, Till at the Seventh time thou in the Skies, As a small Cloud, like a Man's Hand didst rise; Then did thick Mists and Winds the Air deform, And down at last thou pour'dst the fertile Storm; Which to the thirsty Land did Plenty bring, But, tho forewarn'd, o'er-took and wet the King. What since he did, an higher Force him push'd Still from behind, and it before him rush'd, Tho undiscern'd among the Tumult blind, Who think those high Decrees by Man design'd. 'Twas Heaven would not that his Pow'r should cease, But walk still middle betwixt War and Peace; Chusing each Stone, and poysing every Weight, Trying the Measures of the Breadth and Height; Here pulling down, and there erecting New, Founding a firm State by Proportions true. When Gideon so did from the War retreat, Yet by the Conquest of two Kings grown great, He on the Peace extends a Warlike Power, And Isr'el silent saw him rase the Tow'r; And how he Succoth's Elders durst suppress, With Thorns and Briars of the Wilderness. No King might ever such a Force have done; Yet would not he be Lord, nor yet his Son. Thou with the same Strength, &amp; a Heart as plain, Didst (like thine Olive) still refuse to reign; Tho why should others all thy Labour spoil, And Brambles be anointed with thine Oil, Whose climbing Flame, without a timely stop, Had quickly level'd every Cedar's top? Therefore first growing to thy self a Law, Th'ambitious Shrubs thou in just time didst aw. So have I seen at Sea, when whirling Winds Hurry the Bark, but more the Seamens Minds, Who with mistaken Course salute the Sand, And threatning Rocks misapprehend for Land; While baleful Tritons to the shipwrack guide, And Corposants along the Tacklings slide; The Passengers all wearied out before, Giddy, and wishing for the fatal Shore; Some lusty Mate, who with more careful Eye Counted the Hours, and ev'ry Star did spy, The Helm does from the artless Steersman strain, And doubles back unto the safer Main. What tho a while they grumble Discontent? Saving himself he does their Loss prevent. 'Tis not a Freedom that, where All command; Nor Tyranny, where One does them withstand: But who of both the Bounders knows to lay, Him as their Father must the State obey. Thou, and thine House, like Noah's Eight did rest, Left by the War's Flood on the Mountain's Crest: And the large Vale lay subject to thy Will, Which thou but as an Husbandman wouldst till: And only didst for others plant the Vine Of Liberty, not drunken with its Wine. That sober Liberty which Men may have, That they enjoy, but more they vainly crave: And such as to their Parents Tents do press, May shew their own, not see his Nakedness. Yet such a Chammish Issue still does rage, The Shame and Plague both of the Land and Age, Who watch'd thy halting, and thy Fall deride, Rejoicing when thy Foot had slipt aside; That their new King might the fifth Scepter shake, And make the World, by his Example, quake: Whose frantique Army, should they want for Men, Might muster Heresies, so one were ten. What thy Misfortune, they the Spirit call, And their Religion only is to fall. Oh Mahomet! now couldst thou rise again, Thy falling Sickness should have made thee reign; While Feake and Simpson would in many a Tome, Have writ the Comments of thy sacred Foam: For soon thou mightst have past among their Rant, Were't but for thine unmoved Tulipant; As thou must needs have own'd them of thy Band, For Prophecies fit to be Alcoran'd. Accursed Locusts, whom your King does spit Out of the Center of th'unbottom'd Pit; Wandrers, Adultrers, Liers, Munster's rest, Sorcerers, Atheists, Jesuits, Possest; You who the Scriptures and the Laws deface With the same Liberty as Points and Lace; Oh Race most hypocritically strict! Bent to reduce us to the antient Pict; Well may you act the Adam and the Eve, Ay, and the Serpent too that did deceive. But the great Captain, now the Danger's o'er, Makes you for his sake tremble one fit more; And, to your spight, returning yet alive, Does with himself all that is Good revive. So when first Man did thro the Morning new See the bright Sun his shining Race pursue, All day he follow'd with unwearied sight, Pleas'd with that other World of moving Light; But thought him, when he miss'd his setting Beams, Sunk in the Hills, or plung'd below the Streams. While dismal Blacks hung round the Universe, And Stars (like Tapers) burn'd upon his Herse: And Owls and Ravens with their screeching noise Did make the Fun'rals sadder by their Joys; His weeping Eyes the doleful Vigils keep, Not knowing yet the Night was made for sleep: Still to the West, where he him lost, he turn'd, And with such Accents, as despairing mourn'd: Why did my Eyes once see so bright a Ray, Or why Day last no longer than a Day? When strait the Sun behind him he descry'd, Smiling serenely from the further side. So while our Star, that gives us Light and Heat, Seem'd now a long and gloomy Night to threat, Up from the other World his Flame he darts, And Princes, shining thro their Windows, starts; Who their suspected Counsellors refuse, And credulous Ambassadors accuse. “Is this, saith one, the Nation that we read “Spent with both Wars, under a Captain dead? “Yet rig a Navy while we dress us late; “And e'er we dine, rase and rebuild our State. “What Oaken Forests, and what golden Mines! “What Mints of Men, what Union of Designs! “Unless their Ships do, as their Foul, proceed “Of shedding Leaves, that with their Ocean breed. “Theirs are not Ships, but rather Arks of War, “And beaked Promontories sail'd from far; “Of floating Islands a new hatched Nest; “A Fleet of Worlds, of other Worlds in quest; “An hideous shole of Wood-Leviathans, “Arm'd with three Tire of brazen Hurricans; “That thro the Center shoot their thundring side, “And sink the Earth that does at Anchor ride. “What Refuge to escape them can be found, “Whose watry Leaguers all the World surround? “Needs must we all their Tributaries be, “Whose Navies hold the Sluces of the Sea. “The Ocean is the Fountain of Command, “But that once took, we Captives are on Land. “And those that have the Waters for their share, “Can quickly leave us neither Earth nor Air. “Yet if thro these our Fears could find a pass; “Thro double Oak, and lin'd with treble Brass; “That one Man still, altho but nam'd, alarms “More than all Men, all Navies, and all Arms. “Him all the Day, Him in late Nights I dread, “And still his Sword seems hanging o'er my Head. “The Nation had been ours, but his own Soul “Moves the great Bulk and animates the Whole. “He Secrecy with Number hath inchas'd, “Courage with Age, Maturity with Hast: “The Valiant's Terror, Riddle of the Wise; “And still his Fauchion all our Knots unties. “Where did he learn those Arts that cost us dear? “Where below Earth, or where above the Sphere? “He seems a King by long Succession born, “And yet the same to be a King does scorn. “Abroad a King he seems, and something more, “At Home a Subject on the equal Floor. “O could I once him with out Title see, “So should I hope yet he might die as we. “But let them write his Praise that love him best, “It grieves me sore to have thus much confest. Pardon, Great Prince, if thus their Fear or Spight More than our Love and Duty do thee Right. I yield, nor further will the Prize contend; So that we both alike may miss our End: While Thou thy venerable Head dost raise As far above their Malice as my Praise. And as the Angel of our Commonweal, Troubling the VVaters, yearly mak'st them heal. ????????????, Or a full and true Relation of the Great and Bloody Fight between three Pagan Knights and a Christian Giant. 1682. Of Monsters fell, and wondrous Wights, Of Tow'rs inchanted, bloody Fights, Of errant Knaves and errant Knights, I shall compose my Ballad; How a huge Giant fierce and stout, Three gentle Knights at once did rout; Of which, if you the Truth do doubt, The Record's in my Wallet. Contrary to Romantick Rules, By Snatches sweetly conn'd at Schools, Which always make the biggest Fools, Truth here takes part with Giant; For he the Knight's thick Skulls did crack, He laid their Honours on the Back, And did their Ribs full rudely thwack, To make their Purses pliant. Thou great St. George, and Eglamore, Thou Pegasus, and Brigliadore, With all hard Names that Poets roar, And for their Gods have taken; Merlin that made the De'il an Ass, Bladud-ap-creat-Rud-Hudibrass, That thro the Air like Owl could pass, And famous Friar Bacon; Assist, assist my mournful Song! Mingle your pow'rful Charms among, With whisper'd Numbers, dark and strong, Whilst I the Lists do enter. Hence all Profaneness! come not near T'invade the sacred Rituals here, Nor Wine, nor Mony, nor good Cheer, To hinder mine Adventure. An Isle there is, that Albion height, With Fruits and Flowers around bedight, Where Damsel fair, and gentle Knight, In every shade are playing; Where Nightingales each Tree adorn, Spurring their Breasts with watchful Thorn Throughout the Year, where ev'ry Morn The Virgins go a Maying. A Town it has, which Fiends inchant, Where bridled Furies roar and rant, In olden Times, height Troynovant, But now 'tis London stiled; Which by full many a dev'lish Spell, And Brands and Balls fetch'd up from Hell, In its own Cinders buried fell, Of all its Glory spoiled; But when Rome's thred-bare Plots were spy'd, Her Charms unravel'd, Knots untied, 'Twas gloriously re-edify'd, Far Nobler than by th'Founder: Bright Turrets in th'invaded Air, By Negromantick Art they rear; With stately Domes, and Houses fair, Besprinkling all around her. Here the learn'd Sages every Year In venerable Furs appear, To chuse a Christian Officer, That may provide 'em Juries: This makes the Pagan Tories rave, Because their stakes they cannot save; This makes Rogero strut and brave, VVith all his Club of Furies. Some Renegado's stile you can, Two Knights, but ne'er a Gentleman, Sometimes on the hot Scent they ran A hunting for Promotion; And now and then for nimble Bounds, Or treading down their Neighbours Grounds, Their Dog-lookt Friends amongst the Hounds, Are dub'd with great Devotion. Such recreant Knights, accoutred fine With Sword and Mace, their steps incline To a large House, where Sin and Wine On equal Terms are vended; Its Name I know not, tho 'tis said And thought by most, 'twas the Popes-Head, For there like Friends they might be sped, And carefully attended. The first was of as strong a Make, As ever Lance in Justing brake, Or handled Sword for Ladies sake, In Turky or in Persy: From Top to Toe, from Head to Heel, He cas'd himself in burnish'd Steel; For Yard, a Spear he now does feel, And Mail instead of Kersy. The next that carry'd on the Fight, With ponderous Mace of mickle Might, Was Hangman, Senator and Knight, A strange three-headed Monster: Whom scandalizing Whigs in Sport, When to their Brethren they resort, That he's ally'd to the French Court, By's Name's Resemblance conster. The S?f can't the L?s hide, The Knightly Spurs must needs be spy'd, Tho the Gold Chain's about 'em ty'd, The better to obscure 'em; Th'Ass is an Ass, tho cloth'd he be In the cast Robes of Majesty, Tho his long Ears Beasts cannot see, From trembling to secure 'em. The Third, a proper Man 'tis true, But that his Legs did stand askew, And both like Sampson's Foxes grew, One this way, that the other; Nought but their equal Ugliness, Their equal Shape, and equal Dress, Could make th'amaz'd Beholder guess, That this to that was Brother. With him I would not enter Strife, Nor try a Fall to save my Life, For as a Bone upon a Knife, My Legs would split on his-'n: This may without a stretch be sed; Upon my Neck should he but tread, He'd certainly cut off my Head, Before my Tail were ris'n. Enough of these, too much I fear: Now of the Giant you shall hear, That did with Blood their Chaps besmear, And eke their sides bombasted; How on their Skulls he Blows did rain, And kickt 'em down, and up again; How with no little Grief and Pain They from his Clutches hasted. His outward Parts were something small; 'Twas th'inward Powers that acted all; Yet tho a Giant him we call, Let not the Tories blame us: For as close Flames more fiercely roll, Imprison'd in a narrow Hole; So 'twas his brave Gigantick Soul Made's Pygmee-Body Famous. All Tory Cloth, and Drapers too, With Fist, or else with Indigo, He's us'd to dye both black and blue, The best in all the Nation; And lest his Customers be found, Some do suppose he has been bound By heavy Bag of hundred Pound, To hide his Occupation. This Dragon-firking Hercules, This Cadmus, This—e'en what you please, That direful Monsters quell'd with Ease, And drag'd from horrid Cavern; The matter few distinguish can, Whether he freely thither ran, Or was entic'd by a Trepan, And wheedled to the Tavern. Who there behind the Door should lurk, But a false misbelieving Turk, Who thus began the Devil's Work, VVith Glass fast claspt in Clutches. Ah Sirrah! have we got you here? Come pledg a Health to th'Grand-Visier, Or else with speed my Cimiter Shall make new room for Crutches. Sad was the Christian Champion's Case; He had nor Battel-axe, nor Mace, Yet stoutly he took Heart-a-grace, And thus defies the Pagan: False Recreant Wretch as e'er did wield An unbecoming Lance, or Shield! My Head as soon as Knees I'll yield To your Great Bell, and Dragon. Jack Adams struts about the Rooms, And swears, and sinks, and cocks and fumes, That thus one Stubborn Whig presumes On three arm'd Knights to venture; Sirrah you Dog! d'ye prate, d'ye prate? Must Captives then capitulate? Dispatch; or else I'll break your Pate, And ram ye to the Center. No sooner said, no sooner done, The Fight was instantly begun; A Blow he struck enough to stun The stoutest Knight in London: Some fav'ring God, or powerful Charm, To save a courteous Knight from harm, I'th' nick came underneath his Arm, Or there he had been undone. The empty Sword slid glancing by; Not so our Champion, who must try Bravely to conquer, or to die, By hand of miscreant Heathen; But since he saw the War begin, He won't for nothing sell his Skin, But if his reach they come within, He'll give his Foes a breathing. His Fist he bends, and dings it right At's Worship's Face with all his Might, Down on the Floor my gentle Knight All in a heap does tumble: As when one Mungril you attack, The yelping Cur your steps will track, And raise the Parish on your back, His Friends began to grumble. In our Relation to be brief, Sir Simon Suck-egg was the chief, That brought his Brother Fool relief, Than all his Fellows madder; He by his quondam Honours swore, By forked Crest the Arms he bore, And by his Mistress, alias W? To turn him o'er the Ladder. But tho his Hands were thick and long, His Weapon ponderous and strong, And he with Mace laid on ding-dong, Yet still our Champion tight-stood; And after many a crabbed Jowle, Putting aside his weighty Pole, He takes him o'er the Jobbernole, And down he fetcht poor Knighthood. In Triumph over them he goes, Thinking he'ad conquer'd all his Foes, And under his victorious Toes He stamps their batter'd Faces; Sir Simon's Beauty went to pot, That tho in Love he had been hot, His Mistriss soon restore would not Her Favours and good Graces. Beat Death's Alarm upon the Drums! 'Ware Shanks! 'ware Shanks! Sir Harry comes; He bit for Anger both his Thumbs, And at our Champion yawned; He like Alcides did provide To guard himself on either side, When Hydra's Coxcombs multiply'd, And two for one were spawned. With Corps erect, and Visage grim, One Foot he plants on simple Sim, Who sadly growled under him; Sir Bobb supported t'other: With an undaunted Meen, and Air, His conqu'ring Arms he high does rear, And for the third Assault prepare, To drub their Friend and Brother. So have I seen a sprightly Cat, That purring in a Corner sat, In Ambuscade for lusty Rat, Sworn Foe to Cheese and Bacon: When two young Mice that frisking out, From a low Port of their Redoubt, By Governours command to scout, VVere in her Clutches taken. Their piercing Shrieks the Fort affright; Out sallies Rat, prepar'd to fight, As fierce as any Tory Knight, Upon her madly falling; Puss in two Paws shuts Captive Mice, To hinder Rescue, or Surprise; With th'other at her Foe does rise, And down she cuffs him sprawling. Doughty Sir Hall a tiptoe stands, With mighty Fauchion rear'd in Hands, And Satisfaction demands, For both his Friends Mischances; He winks, and then Pell-mell let's drive, Aiming his Head in twain to rive; That was the gentlest Knight alive; But flatlong on't it glances. Our Champion's Head, and Brains ran round, Down he was sinking in a Sound, But yet as soon's he toucht the Ground, Up leapt he like Antæus Antæus, a famous Moorfields Wrestler, who the oftner he was foil'd the more strength he had.: The Turks Arrears he paid him soon, Tho he for Grace did importune, And made him see more Stars at Noon, Than e'er did Galilæus Galilæus an old Conjurer (kin to Gadbury) that saw the Stars at Noon with a spying Glass.. In vain the Wretch for Help does bawl, On Back, and Sides, and Face and all, With Knightly Prowess he does fall, And many a trusty greeting; He laid on Load on empty Crown, Until with a most gracious Frown, His Honour too came ratling down, To give his Friends a meeting. Stout Whig their Noses gently tweaks, Their Sculls, tho thick, all over breaks, And his just Anger on 'em wreaks For their Affront Notorious: He rends their Lace, and Linen pure, (Who can so sad a sight endure?) And Point-Cravats, and Garniture, That made 'em look so glorious. Their empty Crowns rang jangling Peals, Their Foe chimes backward, and reveals The Fire that their warm Ear conceals Whilst they're in woful pickle: Had you but seen 'em how they sat, Spoil'd of their Cloak, and Band, and Hat, You would conclude they had been at A Bristow Conventicle. Now on the Floor their Corps he spreads, Now on their Neck in Triumph treads, Then disoblig'd their Loggerheads, Jumbling them altogether: And if they once but curst or frown'd, He roll'd 'em round, and round, and round, Trailing their Clothes about the Ground, They knew not how nor whither. Sometimes on their fat Guts he jumps, Sometimes their Paunches rudely thumps, And on their Heads makes Egg-like bumps, Whilst their poor Pates were addled; Now he their Jaws accosts with Hand, Now on his Leg prepar'd did stand, To give their Tails a Reprimand, And now their Sides he swaddled. Still he lets drive his furious Blows, Until at last, as most suppose, The Reverent Sirs affront his Nose, With Paracelsian Civet; A T?d they did! So crafty Reynard now and then, When outed by intruding Men, Be-s? the cleanly Badger's Den, To make his Land-Lord leave it. The Tories their bang'd Sides bemoan, They sadly yelp, O hone! O hone! And with full many a dolorous Groan, Hold up their Paws for pity. Sir Bobb and Hal did deeply yell, But who his direful Plaints can tell, That was, while it seem'd good to Hell, A Burden to the City? Thirteen-Pence-Half-penny he'd bestow With generous Fist on Conqu'ring Foe, If he'd be pleas'd to let him go But for one live-long Moment: But since some wiser are than some, Our Champion threatens with a Drum Beating before to kick 'em home, Altho he ne'er so meant. As soon as they had strength to rise, For Crick in Neck, in Back, in Thighs, They look'd about to find their Eyes, Thinking he'd beat 'em all out: So have I seen a maimed Snail, When by rude Heels its Rampires fail, Dragging along its slimy Tail, From thence attempt to crawl out. The Christian had a Noble Soul, And when he saw 'em thus condole, He grants 'em Freedom on Parole, While Fame his Glory raises: This Tell-tale Goddess had a Spy That brought her word immediately; About the City she does fly, And trumpets out his Praises. Of Tory Champions, fierce and stout, London and England all throughout, She the Atchievements spreads about, And of their Valour tattles; But with sly Malice chiefly she Does magnify their Courtesy, When they to odds must yield or flee In such unequal Battels. For when, by unexpected Chance, One did against all Three advance, They yielded out of Complaisance, And took a Civil Drubbing: But since, altho Cock-sure, they fail, And Three to One could not prevail, Thus did the Hot-spur Courage quail Of poor Heroick Robin. Fame's a damn'd Whig, they fret and cry, (Screwing their Mouths up to their Eye) If e'er we meet her she shall dye; Kiss and tell! Out upon her! Fortune we find's a fickle Whore, We'll never trust the Gypsy more: (Thus like a Bittern they did roar) Our Honour! O our Honour! Their Friends advise 'em to compound; If lusty Dyer may be found, And get him unto silence bound, Altho he hard to win is; With sense profound they gravely say, 'Twould be the best and safest way, To lock his Lips with Silver Kay, Or gag his Mouth with Guinies. 'Twas spoke, and instantly 'twas done; Whilst they their Pockets rummage, one To every Coffee-House does run, To find Victorious Dyer: They reason'd on the Point, and he Because they're Friends wont disagree, But out of mere Civility He grants 'em their Desire. Else how is he so chang'd become? He answers nothing now but Mum! To all Enquirers deaf and dumb, Strangely retir'd o'th' sudden. Ask him about it, ask again, Tho of his Silence you complain, Yet still you'll ask, and ask in vain; For, not a word o'th' Pudding. There's your true Spaniels for you, Sirs; Kick 'em, they'll love you ne're the worse, But, like good Christian honest Curs, Or Women of Moscovy, The longer Cudgel one provides, To exercise their Back and Sides, The longer their Good-will abides, And they'll the longer love ye. But, Tories, take a Friend's Advice, Well-willer to your Nose and Eyes, That never lik'd this Enterprize, To Whig-land so delighting: Drink for the Duke while you can stand, Chase all Phanaticks round the Land, With Glasses ready charg'd in Hand; But pray take heed of Fighting. BACCHANALIA: Or a Description of a Drunken Club, 1683. I. It was my hap Spectator once to be, As I unseen in secret Angle sate, Of that unmanly Croud, Who, with Wits low, and Voices loud, Were met to celebrate, In Evening late, The Bacchanalian Solemnity. If what I then, Or heard, or saw, I here relate agen; Accuse me not of Incivility, In blabbing Privacy; Since all Men know, that in those Mysteries, (Quite different from other Deities) No Man obliged is to Secresy. Yea, if I should conceal, 'Twould be in vain: That pervious Tribe would their own Acts reveal, Since Wine (transparent thing!) no Secret can retain. II. The Actors of this Scene were not of one Age, Humour, Figure, or Condition. See one with hollow Cheeks, meagre and lean, By Sipping-Hectick e'en consumed quite, As he a Skeleton had been, Enough to put Death's self into a fright: Only in this he seem'd to differ from the Dead, He lifted off his Hand up to his Head. Another swoln up with Hydropick Fat, Out-strutting Eyes, and Paunch that so o'er-grows, He might vie Bellies with the very Butt, From whence the precious Liquor flows. One comes with Crimson Face, More red than Erysipelas; Another Pale, thro Vital Heat struck dead, By greater heat of Wine extinguished. Yet is the Case of both much what the same, Nature, in one, is on a Flame, And, in the other, all in Ashes laid. One young as Hebe, smooth as Ganimede, Another old Silenus seems to be, With trembling Hand, and Palsy-Head, And lame on Feet, with gouty Malady: One Grave and Saturnine, Another jolly, brisk and fine, He seem'd not much unlike the lusty God of Wine. III. One Noble was, yclep'd a Lord, I wis, Another did a meaner Title take, A Tinker hight; but all's one, that or this, Lyæan Laws no difference do make, Cups reconcile Degrees, and Natures too; He Noblest is, who can in Drink out-do: No boast of Blood will here allowed be, But what from tender Grape is prest. No need of Heraulds, or their Blazonry; He bears best Coat, who bears his Liquor best. (Such Passive Valour is in most Request) No talk of Race, or Pedigree; For Honour here is a mere sudden thing: The Garland hops from Brow to Brow, As more, or less, the moist Atchievements grow, Who yesterday was Puny, now is crown'd a King. IV. But see: the Battel comes, Sound Trumpets now, and Drums! Two Armies rank'd, and facing, I espy'd; Whom nothing but one long Plain did divide, The Table call'd. Well chosen Ground for both, So plain, and smooth, It gave no vantage unto either Side. Signal once giv'n, the Bullets fly From side to side, so furiously, That, in short time, none scap'd without a Wound, Yea bloody Wound; only, 'twixt this And common Wounds some difference is, That those do let Blood out, but these infund. One thing indeed I mus'd to see, Each Soldier to his own Mouth lift his Paw, Before he aim'd at Face of Enemy. What? sure, quoth I, these do their Bullets chaw, Before they fight. Or, is it Dutch-man's Law, Who, e'er his Valour in Sea Fight appear, First takes a Dose of his own Gunpowder? And now the Battle's hot. Each Champion grows (Like chafed Lion) more enrag'd by Blows. For Wounds do Valour but augment, Wounds broach their Fury, and give Rage a vent. Nothing will now their keen Revenge content, Until they see their Foes Lie prostrate at their Feet, senseless and dead, And hence their Blows Are level'd all against the Soul's chief Seat, the Head. V. And, by this time, me-thought, I saw Dame Reason trembling stand upon The Top of her Conarion, Dreading a Deluge from the Floods below. As Mortals in Deucalion's Flood, on cliff Of Caucasus, or Tenariff, On Airy Alps, or Apennine, Prolong'd that Fate, which they could not decline. But what she fear'd is come. See! the Waves rise, and Billows foam; And washing first her Foot, and Shin, Then Wast and Shoulders, Neck and Chin, At last quite stop her Mouth, surround her piercing Eye, Yea swallow Head and Brain, Till nought of her doth visible remain, No not the very Hair, Which stands upright, Thro dismal fright, But all, by swelling Surge, surmounted are. VI. And now a new Scene comes, The Censor's gone, All things in medley and confusion run. Words now, like Thieves in Interregnums, break Their Prisons. All Men hear, and all Men speak: Yet none another understands, nor yet Himself a whit. And, could some nimble-handed Scribe have writ All that was said, Babel had been retriev'd, And all her Tongues reviv'd. Yea more confus'd these Tongues, than Babel's were: They talkt of Towers on Earth, but these in Air. VII. One is all Manhood, talks of nothing else, But Swords, and Guns, and Forts, and Citadels; Sieges, and Fights by Sea and Land, And with a Gravity Censorian, 'Twixt generous Scorn and Pity, doth condemn What the World calls Exploit, or Stratagem. Alas! your Dutch-Fights, or Blake's Tunis Knacks, What were they all, but Squibs and Cracks? Throw Eighty Eight in, 'Twas but a mere Bear-baiting; Cales Fight was but a Flutter, And Great Lepanto, fam'd of yore, To a true Sea-Fight, was no more (Altho Historick Coxcombs make a Splutter) Than shooting Ducks in Pond, or stabbing of an Otter. VIII. Some talk of Bajazet's great Battel; 'Twas more a Tumult, than a Fight, I would more Execution with one Well-marshal'd, resolute Troop, have done, Than Tamerlain's long drove of Motley Cattel. And Cannæ Field (to speak the right) Was merely lost for want Of Courage both, and Management. O, how I would have knockt, had I been there, And kickt, and cuff'd that Punick Cur, As long as he could stir! I would have giv'n him Beef to his Vineger. The stripling Macedonian, What was he to a Man, Altho his Legends make a mighty pother! And those two Roman Boys, Who in Pharsalian Fray did make such noise (As Lucan prates) they did but spit at one another. IX. The World did ne'er yet know What Resolution, join'd with Art, could do. Could I but find A pack of Heroes to my Mind, And of as clear A Valour, as my self; I'd not despair To rid poor Christendom of all its Fear. I'd seize the Turk in his own Dardanells, That all the Spells Of Magick Art should never set him free. Then wafting o'er the Euxine Sea, To Cham of Tartary, I'd make his Cham-ship, and his flat-flac'd Men For eating raw Horse-legs agen. The Persian King I'd take, and in his Carpets roll Him up, like his own Silk-worms; and so bring Him quite away under my Arm. Mogul I'd make to stoop; or, if he durst advance His sturdy Lance, I'd hamstring him, and all his Elephants. So passing on To China, and Japan, To Africk shore, and to American, I'd conquer th'Universe, in far less bound Of time, than lazy Drake, or Magellan could sail it round. X. Another, he is all State-Policy; Esteeming then himself most wise In Mysteries Of Government, when he Has lost the Hegemonick Faculty. As if his Wine-soakt Brains Like Rivers were, Which ever deepest are, In times of greatest Floods, and Rains. Or, as a watry Brook, In Moon-shine Night, we look, And see the Stars, how in their Orbs they move. So, while with Wine His liquid Brains do shine, He sees the Motions of the Powers above: Europe, quoth he, Is merely lost I see, For lack of good Intelligence, And understanding of Intrigues, The Crafts of Treaties and of Leagues, This spoils all States, and ruins Governments. But, were I once in Secretary's Place, I'd quickly bring things to a better pass. Alas! Colbert's an Ass, I'd fox him with his own French Wine; Then gage his Brains, and so the bottom find, Extent and Compass of the French Design. The Jesuits themselves I'd undermine; Out-do th'Ignatian Criples in their Play, I'd halt e're I was lame, as well, and better far than they. XI. Are these the Pope's Grand Tools? Worshipful Noddies! who but blundring Fools, Would ever have forgot To burn those Letters that reveal'd their Plot? Or in an Ale-house told, that Godfrey's dead, Three days before he was discovered; Leaving the silly World to call to mind That common Logick, They that hide can find? But see their Master Policy On Primrose-Hill! Where their Grand Enemy, Like Saul upon Mount Gilboa, doth lie Faln on his Sword, as he himself did kill. But O the Infelicity! That Blood was fresh, and gusht out of the Wound, This so congealed that not one spot was found, No, not upon his Sword; as if it wou'd Tell us, 'twas guiltless of its Master's Blood. Some Carcases, by bleeding, do declare; This by not bleeding, shew'd the Murderer. But, to his broken Neck, I pray, What can our Politicians say? He hang'd, then stab'd himself, for a sure way: Or first he stab'd himself, then wrung about His Head, for madness, that advis'd him to't. Well, Primrose, may our Godfrey's Name on thee (Like Hyacinth) inscribed be, On thee his Memory flourish still, (Sweet as thy Flower, and lasting as thy Hill) Whilst blushing Somerset, to her Eternal shame, shall this Inscription wear: The Devil's an Ass; for Jesuits, on the spot, Broke both the Neck of Godfrey, and their Plot. Thus spake this Sage: whilst I from thence, Infer'd, amidst heaps of Impertinence, Fools sometimes chop on Truth, and Drunkards stumble upon Sense. XII. Another's all Art, and Philosophy. Encyclopædia, with its mighty sound, What is't, quoth he, but when the Brain turns round? Of which versatile Ingeny No Man, I'm sure, is Master more than I. Tongues are my Element. I declare, I'll talk with any Man on Earth, And yet a Dearth Of Words will never fear, The fertile Cups best Dictionaries are. And as for Rhetorick, that two-handed Art, Which plays both Plaintiff's, and Defendant's Part; To me 'tis Natural: for, ev'n now, whate'er Me-thinks I look on, double doth appear. Logick's a Toy. Alas! I'll prove by Syllogisms, a Man's an Ass; Yet never stir out of this Room, (Most Reverend Friends) to find a Medium. Arithmetick, and Algebraick Arts, What are they to a Man of Parts? A Member, he Unworthy sure must be Of such a Learned Club as this, Who understands not what a Reckoning is. Astronomy's a Science which I know So thorowly, that my Head ev'n now, I feel, is in the Clouds: and with each Star I'm so familiar Without a Jacob's Staff, I know not how to go. XIII. Philosophy both new and old I know; The seven wise Men, of whom the Grecians tell us, Were but a Club of honest Fellows, That sat, and drank, and talkt, as we do now; Until the Reckning was come, Then every Man threw in his Symbolum. Yea Sects of old had their Origination But from the Liquor's various Operation. Some, when inspir'd by the Barrel, Grew sceptical, or apt to quarrel: Others, inclin'd to the Dogmatick way, Are wondrous positive in all they say. 'Twas the same Sherry, That made Democritus so merry, And weeping Heraclite so sorry: For he (as most suppose) Was Maudlin, when he snivel'd so at Nose. Some would be so dead drunk, that, pinch them ne'er So hard, they never felt: these Stoicks were. Others were sensible a little, And this was call'd the Peripatetick Whittle. Others, of Epicurus mad-cap strain, No Pleasure knew like drunk, and drunk again: Yea ev'n grave Plato's Academick Tribe No scruple made to bib, Until Idea's crawled in their Brain. As for mechanick Virtuoso's Skill, That found all Knowledg in Experiments, (Altho indeed I know what 'tis, full well, To make Man's Reason truckle to his Sense) Yet I have found a more compendious way; For whilst, in quest of Nature, they By tedious searches clear the Object, I Do all, by strengthening the Faculty; With brisk Falernum, clear the dim-ey'd Soul; This was I'm sure the old Philosophy, That ever sought for Truth i'th' bottom of the Bowl. XIV. But the most frequent Humor's still behind; Which is, to talk of Grave Divinity. Of which the proper Reason to assign, I find it not an easy Task to be, Whether from that near Consanguinity, And natural Love 'Twixt Bacchus and great Jove; Whose Son he was, and hatch'd up in his Thigh, In place we commonly do call Popes-Eye; An Omen that in time he'd prove A great Dictator in Theology: Or, that the Grape so sweet, That Nectar of the Gods, does Men inspire With sacred Fire, And raise their Thoughts to more than humane height: Or that the Intellect doth gasping lie, And thence to utter doth desire Some few grave Sentences, before she die. XV. To give you an Account of my Belief, Quoth one deep Sage, who thought himself a Chief, I'm no Mahometan, But utterly defy the Alcoran, Whose cursed Laws forbid the Use of Wine. Nor shall the Jews Religion be mine, Which so abhors that harmless Beast, the Swine. The Pope I do pronounce to be Stark Antichristian, Which prove by forty Arguments I can. But only, name this one I shall, So strong, it well may serve for all; He takes the Cup from th'honest Laity. Base dirty Clown! I wonder in what Town, Unless it were Hogs-Norton, he was bred; To drink to Men, And presently forbid, On pain of Death they must not pledg agen. Were he un-erring, as he does pretend, His Wit would him have better Manners taught: But Wit and Manners both I see, are naught. And shall I then believe What such a slovenly Religion saith, And pin my Faith Upon a snotty Sleeve? No, no; if e'er my Reason I resign, It shall be only to a Glass of VVine. Thus did the Hero vent 'Gainst triple Crown his Discontent; Throughout which whole Discourse, thought I, An Argument close coucht doth lie 'Gainst Rome's Infallibility, Stronger than what has yet expressed been: For Standers by are apt to think, That Popes sometimes may be in Drink, And then as rambling talk as other Men. XVI. But he proceed. I could rehearse ye The State, quoth he, of Modern Controversy: What Weapons keen are us'd in that sharp Sport, Betwixt Arminius and Dort: How those twit these, with turning Men To Stocks, and how agen The Absolute Divine Whips Cink with Thirty nine; Not much unlike the Jewish scourging Discipline, I could the Gordian Knot unty Of Ecclesiastick Polity; And tell the Street, and Sign, Where that Great Lady dwells, call'd Jus Divine, Who courted long by all has been, But still so coy, she's scarcely to be seen. I could discourse of Ceremonial Jar, (That least yet greatest War) Whose hot Spurs, on each side, engage so far Beyond their slow-pac'd Squadrons, that oft they By mere pursuing lose the Day. Some would confine Religion's Dress To the coarse Freeze of mere Necessity: Others attire her all in Lace, Preferring still the greatest Bravery. Some make her all Embroidery, and Seaming: Some let her ravel out, for lack of Hemming. Some are resolv'd to scruple, whatsoe'er Is by Authority injoyn'd: Whilst some again, to cross the others Mind, Wish all things were enjoyn'd, that scrupled are. But how much better would it be, Would but you Bigots of each side, quoth he, Come hither to observe our prudent Fashion, And imitate our signal Moderation! For we, in these Solemnities, Do neither scruple, nor press Modes upon ye; Drink either with, or without Ceremony. Each Man enjoys his Liberty, provided He takes his Cup, And drinks all up, All other Doubts and Circumstances are decided. XVII. But by this time Tongues 'gan to rest; The talking Game was at the best: A sleepy Scene beginneth to appear. Bright Reason's Ray, By damp of Wine, within this Hemisphere, Was quench'd before: and now dim Sense, to stay Must not expect, long after her. So when Night's fairest Lanthorn, Cynthia bright, Is set; each little Mist, or thin-spread Cloud, Sufficient is to shroud The pink-ey'd Stars, and make a pitchy Night. Old Morpheus comes with leaden Key, His drousy Office to perform: Tho some there are, that do affirm 'Twas Bacchus did it; and that he Had legal Right to lock up each Man's Brain: Since every Room His own Goods did contain, And was his proper Wine-Cellar become. XVIII. Some down into their Seats do shrink, As Snuffs in Sockets sink; Some throw themselves upon the Bed, Some at Feet, and some at Head, Some Cross, some Slope-wise, as they can; Like Hogs in straw, or Herrings in a pan. Some on the Floor do make their humble Bed, (Proper effect of Wine!) So overladen Vine, Prop failing, bows its bunchy Head, To kiss the Ground, from whence 'twas nourished. One, stouter than the rest, maintain'd the Field, And scorn'd to yield. A Roman Emperor, standing, vow'd to die, And so quoth he, will I; Till nodding, as he stood, the Churlish Wall Repuls'd his Head, and made him reeling fall; So with a jot, Embrac'd the common lot, The last, but yet the greatest, Trophy of them all. XIX. So slept they sound; but whilst they slept, Nature, which all this while had kept Her last reserve of Strength, In Stomach's Mouth, where, Helmont saith, The Soul its chiefest Mansion hath, Began at length To kick, and frisk, and stoutly strove To throw the liquid Rider off. For now her Case like Mariners was grown, In leaky Ship, she must or pump or drown. Or whether that the Wine, which, till this time, Was wont to dwell in Cellar's cooler Clime, Now put in Stomach's boiling-pot, Found its new Habitation too hot. Whate'er it was, the Floods gusht out From ev'ry spout, With such a Force, they made a fulsom Fray. One who athwart his Neighbour lay, Did right into his Pocket disembogue; For which the other would have call'd him Rogue, But that his forestall'd Mouth (Brawls to prevent) Replenisht was with the same Element. I'th' next Man's Face another spues, Who doth, with nimble Repartee, retort His own, and his Assailant's Juice, And so returns him double for't. One with a Horizontal Mouth, Discharges up into the Air, Which falls again in perpendicular: Much like those Clouds in Sea, that's South, Which in a Lump descend, and quite O'er-whelm the Ship on which they chance to light. The Floor with such a Deluge was o'erflown, As would infallibly have ran Quite thro, and to its native Cellar gone, As Rivers circulate to th'Ocean; Had it not been incrassate with a Scum, Which did, for company, from Stomach come. Nor was this all. The surly Element, With Oral Channels not content, Reverberates, and downward finds a Vent: Which my nice Muse to tell forbears, And begs, for what is past, the pardon of your Ears. XX. At length the Storm blows o'er; the Sky grows clear, Clouds are dispel'd, and Fogs, and Fumes, And Madam Dianoia now resumes Her Throne; when nimble Drawer mounts the stair, And guessing, by this time, these Heroes were In Reckning-case; produceth, sans delay, A Bill more swel'd, and more inflam'd than they. Gigantick Items! yet evicted Nothing could be, nor contradicted By any of the Company; Because 'twas all beyond Man's Memory. Since then Objection was fruitless, Solution must be the Business. All Pockets (but ev'n now well lin'd) were swept, Not one Cross for a Nest-egg kept. Tokens, and single Pence, must go, Jacobusses, and Medals too; And all too little to discharge the Score, But forc'd to sign a Bill for as much more. And thus the Poets Fiction came to pass, That Bacchus conquered the Golden India's. XXI. All done, and now just ready to depart, I, from my close recess, out start, And cry'd, Hold Gallants! I perceive, The Play is done; yet give a Stranger leave, Before the Company up break, In a few words the Epilogue to speak. EPILOGUE. Now these mad Hurricanes are over-blown, In cooler Thoughts, consider what y'ha' done. Think, each of you this day has kill'd a Man, Stabbing with Murd'rous Hand That noble Reason, by which Mortals are Most like their Maker, and do bear Their Great Creator's Superscription. Think of your ruin'd Health. See! your own Blood Flies in your guilty Face: as if she wou'd Now tell you, to your Head, 'Tis you alone By whom she's scorch't, disordred, and undone. Think of those Hours consum'd in sordid Vice, Those Golden Sands that run in vain, (Lusts Measure made and Sacrifice) Those winged Hours that ne'er return'd again. Think of that abused Wealth Due to your Families, or the Poor: Think how you swallow, in each drunken Health, The Widows Tears, and starved Orphans Goar. Think of your Bankrupt Reputation; Each Ear abhors your more than brutish Name; More dirty than the Dirt you tread upon: Your very Vomit stinks not like your Fame. Think, lastly, on the World's great Doom, When guilty Souls must to an Audit come: A far more heavy Reckoning, than e'er You met with here; More true by far, and yet far more severe. Think on all this, and think on't soberly; And then perhaps you'l say, as well as I, Your Mirth is Madness: Wine is Poison fell, Your Paradise is Bedlam, if not Hell. A POEM, occasion'd by the late Discontents and Disturbances in the State, 1691. With Reflections upon the Rise and Progress of Priest-Craft. Written by N. TATE. ? Liberius si Dixero quid, si forte Jocosius, Hoc mihi juris Cum Venia dabis. Hor. Vincit Amor Patriæ. Virg. Near Isis Spring, the Muses poor Retreat, Palæmon dwelt in his unenvied Seat; Whose little, but Hereditary Soil, Answer'd his mod'rate Hopes, if not his Toil; For Nature's Wants did modestly provide, Content and Innocence the rest supply'd. His Years declin'd, his Thoughts their manly Fire Preserv'd, advancing as his Days retire. None better knew or practis'd in his Cell The chast Delights that in Retirement dwell, That scorn the Golden Mansions of the Proud, And fly the Haunts of the unhallow'd Croud; Betimes he shun'd the beaten Roads of Strife, And found the secret Track to peaceful Life. Too Bless'd, if while his private Cares did cease, No Fears had seiz'd him for his Country's Peace; So strong the Guard of Vertues which he chose, Fate had no other way to his Repose. Religion He, and Loyalty, held dear; Bigot in neither, tho in both Sincere, In ev'ry Course by Truth and Sense did steer: Did gen'rously his Rules for Practice draw From Sacred Writ, and uncorrupted Law. Of Church and Court th'Encroachments did survey; In Priests and Statesmen found the same foul Play; Both Functions saw alike by Int'rest sway'd, Both grown a Cheat, for both were grown a Trade. Philander, whom the Muses Charms had mov'd, By Learn'd Palæmon's Rules his Vein improv'd, And next the Muses his Palæmon lov'd. His awful Steps with rev'rend distance trac'd, Silence and Sacred Poverty embrac'd. His sole Ambition to compose some Lay, That might to Britain's Pollio force its way; From his sharp-judging Patron gain a Smile, And of an Hour the waiting State beguile. In this alone he wrong'd the Publick Weal, For which no Swain confess'd a warmer Zeal. Opprest with Thought, one Ev'ning he repairs, With his Palæmon, to concert his Cares: Just then returning from his Ev'ning's Round, His Farm's short Bounds, the good old Swain he found; Who in his Arms brought home a new-ean'd Lamb, A Firstling, but forsaken by its Dam. The Youth with that unkindly Omen struck, To vent his pensive Thoughts occasion took, And thus began— PHILANDER. —The same Disorder reigns Amongst our Flocks that has possest our Swains; Perversly both to their own Hopes unkind, Expose their tender Comforts to the Wind. But lately 'twas that ev'ry Shepherd sung, While with the gen'ral Glee the Valleys rung, As Nature had renew'd, and fresh Creation sprung; Each Muse to the Restorer tun'd her Lyre, Their only and almost despair'd desire. They sung, How in his Belgick Seat he lay Silent as Night, but watchful as the Day; His sure, but secret Counsels did advance To check the Progress of encroaching France, While Belgia did the Tyrant's Summons wait, And Britain from the Continent disjoin'd, No Safety in her Seas embrace could find, Not Britain knew to shun the common Fate. To Bondage sold, despairing to be freed The servile Contract, her own Act and Deed. Her Roman Masters at their Conquest smile; Secure in Hopes, they cantle out the Isle. Palæmon, you must needs remember well That ruthful Season which you could foretel, To Unbelievers preacht, who mourn'd too late Their Trojan Fathers Folly, and their Fate. If just Disdain will suffer, call to mind How in that pensive Time Our Swains at their own handy-work repin'd, And curs'd their Tillage to new Lords assign'd; Wish'd Blight and Mildews on their gen'rous Soil, E'er Lubber-Priests should batten on the Spoil, And consecrated Sloth devour their Toil. By Husbandmen of yore forwarn'd the Harm, No Caterpillars like a sacred Swarm. The vile Remembrance we can scarce support, How Vermin to our Palace did resort, And Nations purg'd their Scum into our Court. The Rogue was qualify'd for Magistrate, Tribunals then were Shambles of the State. We suffer'd much, and Fear suggested more, Till Ruin should o'erwhelm our fenceless Shore, We heard the near advancing Billows roar. With ev'ry Gust th'impetuous Tide came on, Our Sluces open'd, and our Moundings gone, When Tyranny with Sword high-brandish'd stood, And Zeal, the worst of Fiends, for seeming good, The Monster now confest with darted Claws, And lick'd for Thirst of Blood her frothy Jaws. 'Twas then Fame's Voice did first our Coasts surprize, (A Voice like that shall bid the Dead to rise) That brave Nassau approach'd to our Relief: With Joy as speechless as our former Grief, The Tidings we receiv'd; with early Eyes, Preventing Day, we watch'd the Eastern Skies: At last the Hero came, the long expected Guest, As from a present Deity The conscious Monsters fly, The Specters vanish'd, and the Land had rest. PALÆMON. Unparallel'd in Story was the Change! But nothing, where such Virtue works, is strange. PHILANDER. Then tell me, good Palæmon, whence this Cloud Of Discontent, that does our Morning shroud? Can we so soon grow sick of Happiness, So soon suspect the Blessings we possess? The Reasons of this stupid Change relate, Our Fault or Lot, our Folly or our Fate. PALÆMON. Too soon we slept, and let the watchful Foe, Before our Wheat was sprung, his Darnel sow. PHILANDER. A disappointed Foe you cannot blame, At once by Int'rest urg'd Revenge and Shame. Think not a losing Gamester will be fair, Who at his best ne'er play'd upon the Square. PALÆMON. Rome's Frauds are now of such an antient Date, The Harlot pleads her Privilege to cheat. Her holy Panders too you must forgive, Who keep her Trading up, by which they live: The Ghostly Pimps must starve, or else combine, For her Support, the State to undermine. Necessity sways here with some Pretence To Right Divine—at least to common Sense: But who that unintelligible Wight Can e'er decipher, call'd a Jacobite? (The Appellation he with Pride do's claim, Nor will I grutch him the auspicious Name) How shall we him define, who ne'er could find The Sentiments of his own wayward Mind? Foe to his Own, and to his Country's Ease, And whom no Colour of Affairs can please: For, trust him with the Pow'r he do's aspire, With mad Career he drives into the Mire; While grov'ling there, in woful Plight he lies, He wearies Earth and Heav'n with restless Cries. Assist the Wretch, and place him on firm Land, He'll curse the Friendly unexpected Hand. PHILANDER. How dismal were your State, ye murm'ring Race, Shou'd your own fatal Wishes once take place? But Heav'n, and Godlike Kings, their Grace extend, And ev'n to save th'ingrateful condescend. PALÆMON. Ah! what can Heav'n, and Godlike Kings devise For their Relief? what Charm unseal their Eyes, Whom common Danger warns not to be wise? PHILANDER. Yet, good Palæmon, lest the Plague increase, Mark out and brand the Troublers of our Peace. PALÆMON. The Faction a meer Hydra you will find, Whose different Aspects to one Trunk are join'd, Of Human Form, but all of Serpent-Kind. Some hiss and murmur, whom no Schemes of Law Can please, but what their own wild Notions draw; Nor would ev'n these content the Changelings long. Others by Sympathy affect the Wrong, To Error by Impulse of Nature led, Like Dungeon Toads on pois'nous Vapours fed, 'Mongst Caitiffs, who had sold for stated Sums Their Country, summon'd now to hasty Dooms. They who had longest trusted, most repin'd, Discarded Knaves, to want and shame consign'd, The Drudg'ry past, their dear Arrears behind. For Envy some revile, who wanted Heart In the bold Scene to bear a timely Part. Some who nor Prince nor Providence dare trust, Cautious how they too soon the Foe disgust, Decry the Cause, of present Grace assur'd, And wisely for another Turn secur'd. Some sleepy Sots, born swiftly down the Stream, Wake, stare, &amp; think the wondrous Change a Dream, Some who had lent their helping-hand, recoil; For want of Business, their own Work they spoil; Fall off, as they came on, they knew not why; Start any Game, and they'll pursue the Cry. Mistaken Politicks did some incense; And some found fault for honest want of Sense. The frailer Soul (for when were Women wise?) Give ear to murm'ring Fiends suggested Lies, Fair gloz'd to cheat 'em of their Paradise. PHILANDER. But Man methinks his Reason should recal, Not let frail Woman work his second Fall. PALÆMON. The Sex to censure were unjust and rude; The Foe has few to boast beside the Leud. To spiritual Whore-mongers let Whores be kind, Their carnal Harlotry were too confin'd, Without the Fornication of the Mind. Rank next the giddy Thoughtless Lawless Rout, The Atheist, and mistakenly Devout; Bigots whose cross-grain'd Piety loose-rid, Starts, flounces, kicks— Tame Asses when by Tyrants they're bestrid. PHILANDER. Ah! when did Mischief in the State begin, Where Conscience did not for her share come in? PALÆMON. Mark the whole Chain of Publick Woes, you'l find The last Link still to the Priest's Girdle join'd. Pan prosper me, as I the Function hold Most Sacred, and the Watchmen of the Fold; But hate the Shepherds who their Labour spare, To Hirelings leave their Flocks, their only Care To call at Sheering-time for an ungodly Share: Fleece-warm, and with an Amaryllis sped, They pipe and feast, and jocund Measures tread, While their lean Sheep look up, and are not fed. Nor care which way, make but the Stipend large, Thro Door or Breach they climb into the Charge: Profit with them is Grace's loudest Call; Preferment's Sacred, let the Blessing fall From a Court-Mistress, or a Priest of Baal. PHILANDER. From hence, from this corrupted Fountain's Head, The poison'd Stream of Passive Nonsense spread. Divines of Fortune, to deserve their Pay From Court, the People to the Prince betray; With Fire and Lough-Bells for his Service set, To awe the Partridge, while he spreads his Net; To honest Self-Defence Damnation give, And ring their constant Peal, Prerogative. PALÆMON. While elder Chanticleers, and more inspir'd, To sound the Spiritual Watch alone aspir'd, Our young and dapper Brood of forward Chicks No sooner perch, but scream out Politicks. Grown Parish-Cocks, each in his Barn can crow Against tame Fowl, but Cravens to the Foe; Plump, richly-plum'd, and of the treading strain, They strut amongst their Hens, and spread their pompous Train. PHILANDER. Ah! had the Passive System no support Beside the Cock'ril Clergy of the Court, The Church long since had lent the Cause her Hand; But awful Names, and such as bore Command, Too far, too long indulg'd the sickly Dream: Peace springs; but while reserv'd those Leaders seem, The Herd gaze on, and dare not tast the stream. PALÆMON. Enough: If Great Examples may prevail, Our brightest Stars have scap'd the Dragon's Tail; Have own'd Heav'ns Cause, and took their Michael's Part, Nor e'er from free-born Truth's Defence did start; Whose Sense no Gorgons, no Chimæras charm, To hang dead Weights on their Restorer's Arm; Who ne'er to slavish Principles gave way, That would Religion, Church and State betray: From antient Sanctions still their Measures drew; And, tho they soar'd not with a modern Crew, Eusebia ne'er cou'd boast of Sons more true. In this bright List let that learn'd Champion come, Eusebia's Glory, and the Scourge of Rome; Whose piercing Wit to all her Frauds gave light, The deep engender'd Births of Papal Night. The Fiends, who long secure in Darkness lay, Shrunk from his Beams, and yield at sight of Day. Of num'rous Champions can Eusebia boast; But this the Leader of the Sacred Host. PHILANDER. Yet equal Praise to that learn'd Pastor give, Of Modern Skill, and Meekness Primitive; But bold in Fight, with Arguments concise, He lightens in the Eyes of Rome and Vice: With Wonder Men, with Triumph Angels see His blameless Life, from Pride and Passion free; No Priest more frank the Ghostly Counsel gives; No Lay-man with more lib'ral Hand relieves. Unpractis'd in the Worldly Shepherd's Guile, His Life's whole Business is to reconcile; His very Aspect breathes an Air of Grace So mild, he carries Gospel in his Face. PALÆMON. How shall Eusebia then her self excuse, Whose Builders cou'd this Corner-stone refuse? PHILANDER. Yet e'en th'unjust Repulse his Worth confess'd, Rejected by the Many, not the Best. PALÆMON. Ah! without Envy let the Truth be told, Such as ne'er knew the Shepherd's staff to hold, Fear'd Moderation wou'd set ope the Fold. PHILANDER. Oft have I found, while I my Sheep did guide To Pastures sweet, the Friendly Gate set wide; They freely enter'd, and my Crook obey'd, But still of narrow Inlets were afraid: Or if a Bridg too streight they spy'd afore, Wou'd rather take the Stream, than venture o'er. But say, what Prejudice had thence ensu'd, Had they receiv'd the separate Multitude? Was ever Shepherd yet a Foe to Peace, Or e'er repin'd to see his Flock increase? PALÆMON. The Fold set ope, had gain'd more Sheep, 'tis true, But had withal receiv'd more Shepherds too, Who with new Stewards Diligence at first (If not for Conscience-sake) their Flocks had nurs'd; Our Loiterers from hence foresaw their Doom, When none but painful Pastors cou'd have room. This made 'em rave like Men on Ruin's brink, And cry, the Deluge comes, stop ev'ry Chink, Shut fast the Door, or else the Ark will sink. To lose one useless Peg did Shipwreck seem, And ev'ry rotten Rafter was a Beam. PHILANDER. Let question'd Beauties owe their Charms to Dress, Eusebia's Frame does all that's Fair possess; Too gaudy Tire but makes a Matron scorn'd, Let mild Eusebia shine A Firmament by her own Stars adorn'd. PALÆMON. Yet Meteors to the Firmament may rise, And Comets Pestilent invade the Skies: 'Twas so of old.— Their Influence in first Ages did appear, Bright and untroubled shone the Church's Sphere, Till Sons of Vengeance got th'Ascendent there. In petty Factions first her Stars engag'd, Till War broke out, and Persecution rag'd. This Pest, by Constantine's warm Summer bred, At once thro all th'infected Clergy spread. The bloody Paths had long in vain been trod, Till Heathen Princes, tir'd, threw down the Rod; Ambitious Priests the Utensil to burn Thought pity, till themselves had took their turn, And persecuting by more dextrous Rules, Prov'd Maximine and Dioclesian Fools. 'Twas Rooting up God's Heritage before, While Magistrates the Iron Scepter bore: In Them the Exercise, tho more severe, Was Discipline, and Ecclesiastick Care. PHILANDER. For Church or State on Conscience to impose, Must wider make the Breach they think to close: And he that Fetters wou'd for Reason find, May shackle the Sun-beams, and grasp the Wind, Which no Restraints of Human Laws will know, But where and when they please will shine or blow. But Truth should bind; And your Opinion's true, And erring Judgments should submit to you, I grant.— But first you must convince by Reason's Light, That They mistake, and You are in the right: Where You mistake, and they the Truth may hit, Will you to your own Rule of Force submit? You'll plead the Privilege They urg'd before, Conviction crave, and They demand no more. Conviction clear the Soul can only win; With Club or Hammer try to force the Pin, The Brains you may beat out, ne'r drive the Notion in. Absurd the Zeal that Gospel's Pow'r promotes 'Gainst Gospel-Laws, and Peace by cutting Throats; That Faith to plant does Charity disband, And break for doubtful Truths a clear Command. Since first this Pest the Christian World annoy'd, Since Persecuting Power the Church enjoy'd, Zeal marr'd Religion, Creeds the Faith destroy'd. PALÆMON. Where Rome bears sway, bid Laws Divine farewel, And Human Rights t'assert, is to rebel. Speak, suffering Witness, I appeal to Thee, Thou First Apostle of our Liberty, Condemn'd to Stripes. Thy Crime? Thou didst presume To write 'gainst Arbitrary Pow'r and Rome; Didst Inferences of strange Treason draw, And say, 'Twas legal to defend the Law. Thy envious Foes no other Crimes could urge, And to confute thy Pen, produc'd the Scourge. PHILANDER. You mention'd Constantine, in whose mild Reign The harass'd Church did first her Freedom gain, When Priests secure to Bishopricks aspir'd, Without First-Fruits of Martyrdom requir'd: Tell me, How then could Cruelty intrude? How came the Persecuting Plague renew'd? PALÆMON. Lust, Riot, Avarice, Ambition, Strife, Are Bastard Off-springs of too peaceful Life. With nice Disputes the wanton Priests began, To Envy next, and wild Confusion ran; Wou'd Mysteries too curiously enquire, That first rais'd Smoke, then set the Church on Fire. From brangling Arius the first Fire-brand came; PHILANDER. But Constantine took care to quench the Flame. PALÆMON. The Nicene Fathers, summon'd to decide The Strife, instead of Lenitives apply'd, Too late convinc'd th'indulgent Emperor, How fatal 'twas to trust a Priest with Pow'r. PHILANDER. The pious Prince, to do th'Assembly Grace, Refus'd (I've heard) Himself to take his place, Till they were sat.—'Twas Favour ill apply'd, If such Behaviour taught the Doctors Pride. PALÆMON. Then having, as a Christian Monarch ought, First burnt th'Invectives which the Fathers brought Against each Other, and for Union press'd, Thus to the Council he himself address'd: God made you Priests, and God alone can be Your Judg; Rest therefore from my Censure free; No Man shou'd judg of Gods, and You are Gods to Me. PHILANDER. When Princes yield, the Prelate must prevail. PALÆMON. When e'r did Priest to take Advantage fail? Forthwith Church-Censures flew as thick as Hail: The Arian System to just Flames assign'd, And Nicene Creed with Penalties enjoyn'd. They fix'd not here; but for each trifling Cause The Metal try'd of their new Penal Laws. Think how each Victor went triumphant home, With Titles swell'd too bulky for his Dome, From Council Orthodox and Catholick; Each Hare that cross'd him was an Heretick. And if his Horse but stumbl'd in his way, Th'erroneous Beast incur'd th'Anathema. PHILANDER. Yet, since they squar'd by Rules of Sacred Writ Their Symbol, you to their Decrees submit. PALÆMON. I own what e'er the Sacred Books contain, Can Mysteries believe, tho not explain; Have none in Footsteps of first Martyrs trod, And dy'd for Truth, who ne'r conceiv'd the Mode? Brand such as won't to Truths reveal'd agree, But Penalties on such as cannot see What others can, is Breach of Charity. Had Charity in Synods interpos'd, The seamless Garment's Rent had soon been clos'd, Which to repair the wrangling Doctors try'd, (While Metaphysicks Sacred Truths decide) And by ill-botching made the Rent more wide; But they had now learnt Sciences, and must To their own Fame, as well as Truth be Just: Would Mysteries, not like Mechanicks know, But both the ??? and ???? show; Were subtle School-men grown, and to agree, Had Scandal been to their Philosophy. PHILANDER. But tell me, did these Clouds the Faith invade, When first whole Nations were its Converts made? PALÆMON. The Faith shone clear till School-terms, rais'd like Mists, Favour'd the Juggles of imposing Priests, And Councils having Scripture Bounds o'er-past, Advanc'd to forging of New Creeds at last; Which by the Hocus of Infallible, Went down so glib the Difference few could tell; The Priest's Turn better serv'd, and pleas'd the Croud as well. They heard how their Redeemer at his Death Did Sacred Legacies to all bequeath, Which if they'd now inspect, and had the skill, The Church into her Hands had got the Will; For now the Laity were left i'th' Lurch, Th'encroaching Clergy were become the Church: Nor stood the Magistrate on higher Ground, In vain to Scripture their Appeals they found, While 'twas the Church's Priv'lege to expound. Thus (thro Indulgence, fond of such as reign'd, And thro the People's Sloth) th'Ascendent gain'd, Rome's Prelate top'd upon her Temp'ral Pow'r, And from her Priest became her Emperor. With artful Baits the Fisher long had sought, And Empire was the Fish at last he caught. But Time, and Breath, and Patience too wou'd fail, To count the Steps of this prodigious Scale; Suffice it, that at first th'Impostor gain'd By Frauds his height, and by worse Frauds maintain'd; Sloth, Ignorance, blind Zeal, and blinder Fear, Combin'd to level Thrones, and mount the Chair. PHILANDER. 'Twas then th'aspiring Clergy crown'd their Hope, And form'd their Church-Leviathan, a Pope, In whom they still possess the Pow'r they give, Earth's Tyrant, but their Representative. PALÆMON. 'Tis done, th'ambitious Priest has got the Day, The Prelate rules, and Princes must obey; The Spiritual Lord exalted to the Skies, Looks down, and all the Subject World defies; Does safe his Empyræan Height possess, His only Care to manage his Success; How to dispense his Beams, to whom be kind, And who shall his Malignant Aspects find; To whom large Territories he shall give, To whom sell Crowns, &amp; whom of Crowns deprive, To judg who best to Merit does pretend, And Merit is to be the Church's Friend. PHILANDER. For Crimes so black, that Human Nature shockt, Unpeopled Earth, and Hell's Plantations stockt; Th'Indulgence-Shop was ope'd with Pardons stor'd, And to a Friend good pen'orths cou'd afford, At th'old fixt Rates, the rest their Ware must take. PALÆMON. But if you're impious for the Church's sake, Ev'n with their Office-Fees they can dispense, They con you Thanks, and consecrate th'Offence. A Cut-throat Priest of Murder cou'd make sport, From Laws protected by the Spiritual Court; Kings let him kill, and blackest Treasons act, His Judges still were Parties in the Fact. PHILANDER. What if a Lay-man did the Priest offend? PALÆMON. An injur'd Priest, or who could Wrong pretend, Cry'd, Burn the Heretick—the ready Stake Forthwith did Pious Reparation make. PHILANDER. To hurt his Person made the Sentence Just, What the Priest said, 'twas Death but to mistrust. PALÆMON. Fear more than Wit this Tyranny enjoin'd, Lest the dull Croud at last the Cheat should find, And to requite their gross pernicious Pranks, Pull down their Stage, and stone the Mountebanks: Dull Souls with Ease are of their Rights bereav'd, But none revenge, like Fools, when undeceiv'd; And strongest Stomachs, with large Draughts opprest, The last disgusts, and throws up all the rest: Heap Crime on Crime, to keep the Frauds from Air, The last of course must lie expos'd and bare; And too much Weight o'erthrow the guilty Chair. Now Monster, Triple-Crown'd, expect thy Doom, Luther the Saxon Thunder-bolt is come, T'unhinge at once the Babel-Toils of Rome. For tho to Heav'n the threatning Front aspire, He'll shew the wretched Basis laid in Mire In Papal Nets, shall Breaches make so wide, That Kings &amp; Kingdoms thro the Rents shall slide. Then shall Eusebia, cloth'd in Truth Divine, Her Roman Rust fil'd off, the Stars out-shine. PHILANDER. Far must her first Reformers Skill extend, To leave succeeding Ages nought to mend. PALÆMON. I don't pretend to judg, since all confess Her Beauty, who except against her Dress; Which if she may with Decency neglect, Or does too much the Roman Mode affect, I leave her Guides that Question to decide, And dare not charge the Sacred Dame with Pride: I'd see Contention, but not Order cease; Order is needful, nor less needful Peace: Hope, tho unthinking Formalists repine, Th'Indulgent Mother will at last incline To gratify her Pious Constantine, The Hero from Domestick Cares unbind To prosecute the Business of Mankind; Wave Jealousies, and yield the Trust that's due To her kind Patron, and Restorer too. Her Sacred Birth-right may she so retain, Dissenting Flocks so may her Sheep-folds gain, And leave the baffl'd Wolf to grin &amp; houl in vain. PHILANDER. The Mother still in vain will condescend, In vain to wilful Sons her Arms extend; As she enclines let them Advances make, Beware how Pride for Conscience they mistake; How uncommission'd Shepherds lead astray, Securely on the wilder'd Sheep to prey. Divided Flocks, but make the Wolf more bold, The greatest Safety's in the common Fold; The Bars remov'd, Compliance mild will show Your Pastor's Care, if for Themselves or You. Our ablest Guides for Comprehension strive, That Sacred Union may once more revive; None more than He who late the Mitre took, Deserv'dly, as before He held the Crook, The skilful'st Textman at the Shepherd's Book: True to his Function, and the Publick-Weal, For which his steddy Votes have prov'd his Zeal: In each Debate (by Party or Design Unbiass'd) does his Country's Int'rest join, And stamps on State-Decrees a Seal Divine. What Shepherd from his Judgment would divide, What Flock refuse to wait on such a Guide, Whose Truth and Courage has of old been try'd? Whom not the raging Pestilence could make To slake Attendance, or his Charge forsake; His Sheep to Comfort did their Danger share, When Hirelings fled, and for themselves took care. PALÆMON. From hence let Britain her new Freedom date, The Church consenting to support the State, Since she at last has found a King to Trust, And Worthy Senate, who to both are Just. PHILANDER. Hail, generous Patriots, you that poize the Realm! And lest encroaching Waves the State o'er-whelm, Bring kind Supplies while Cæsar sits at Helm. In vain th'Oppress'd would call for his Alarms, And Conquest beckon forth his Pious Arms, Unless with Europe's Freedom you comply'd; Cæsar and You must Europe's Fate decide, Invading Pow'rs within just Limits draw, Teach Tyrants Justice, and Oppressors Law. For tho the Gallick Pride has swell'd so high, United States and Empire to defy, Stol'n Conquest boast, &amp; Neighbouring Cities hold, The wretched Purchase of extorted Gold; From you, the Tyrant his Just Doom must wait, For Nero's Guilt must look for Nero's Fate: Ev'n now the State-Magician in his Cell, Sits close contriving some new impious Spell, Which He sends forth his Dæmons to perform, Well-skill'd to raise, but dares not meet the Storm: 'Tis You the Sword must furnish, You must Arm Our Pious Hero to dissolve the Charm. PALÆMON. Our Swains o'er-joy'd their Senate's Conduct see, And carve their Sacred Names on ev'ry Tree; To their disposal yield their Grain and Fleece, A ready Off'ring to their Country's Peace. PHILANDER. Oh! like our Patriots may our Swains agree! From home-bred Strife, as foreign Dangers free: So shall our Vales resume their former Lays, And Shepherds skill'd in Song the Consort raise, To celebrate once more our great Restorer's Praise; Employ their Leasure purchas'd by his Toil, In Raptures on Juverne's rescu'd Soil. PALÆMON. Repeat, kind Youth, for I o'er-heard your Strain Last Night, by Moon-shine, from the dusky Plain, That joins the Copse, my Farms extremest Bounds; Repeat, for they were more than vulgar Sounds. Your Song pursu'd the Hero to the Coast Of moist Juverne, where the adverse Host Confus'd, the Mountain Passes did resign, And shew'd their Rear to the disdaining Boyne, On whose steep Banks our British Troops you left: Of what ensu'd the listning Dales bereft; Nor had retrencht your welcome Notes so soon, If shrill Lycisca had not bay'd the Moon. PHILANDER. To happy Swains that task I must resign, Who sing beneath the Shade of their own Vine; From dewy Morn, and sultry Noon can creep To their cool Sheds, and chuse to pipe or sleep; With vacant Songs call up the Ev'ning Star, Their Strains may rouze the noble din of War, Make Squadrons move, give foaming Steeds the Rein, And trace a Hero through the dusty Plain, Lure hov'ring Conquest down where they incline; Thro all you see the gen'rous Freedom shine: And what false strokes their Pencil strikes in Heat, Their happy Leisure makes correct and great. What can Philander do, the wretched Heir Of Thought-confounding Grief, and Slave of Care, To servile Hours of tedious Day confin'd, Expos'd all Night to welter thro the Wind, To tend in Sun-burnt Lawn, or thirsty Dale, His Master's Flock, and must make good the Tale? How shall the strict Damætas be repay'd? Suppose a Milcher stoln, or Firstling stray'd; With Notes refin'd can I repair the Wrong, Or make him Restitution with a Song? 'Twas then great Maro found the Art to charm, When he regain'd his Freedom and his Farm, With Meadows, and an Oaten Pipe began, Till warm'd with ripening Beams he sung the Man. Thy poor Philander to the Muses Seat By stealth has crept, and felt th'inspiring Heat; Been Midnight-Present at the sacred Quire, Has seen'd the laurel'd God, and heard his Lire; In smooth Pirene dipt his Fancy's Wing, And tasted of the learn'd Castalian Spring. What steads it that he knows his Flow'rs to cull, If ruffling Care, before his Garland's full, Confound the fancy'd Order in a Trice, Moil his clear Spring, and blast his Paradise? PALÆMON. Yet has our Britains Pollio heard thy Lays? PHILANDER. Our Pollio's Skill might Phebus Envy raise: For tho the Court be Pollio's proper Sphere, Altho he shines the brightest Planet there, He thinks no scorn sometimes to cheer the Plain, Oft condescends to hear the rural Strain; Yet Pollio's Smiles should make no Shepherd vain. My uncouth Muse let gibing Goat-Herds laugh To Death, and Codrus write her Epitaph, If Pollio's Goodness she so far abuse, Or Ween he likes because he does Excuse. On Wits steep Heights he sits the ruling God, Those Heights which by himself alone are trod, Yet thence vouchsafes his gentle Beams to throw, And pitys all the panting Croud below. PALÆMON. Yet William's Praise no Shepherd can refuse, And Fortune may assist the daring Muse: Deep Sense of Duty, and immense Desire Can make the Pipe keep Consort with the Lire, The vanquish'd Boyne and Shannon will inspire. PHILANDER. When next we meet, expect the Silvan Rhime, Night hastens, and 'tis now my Folding time; The winding Song will ask your Leisure's leave, Employ your Patience, tho your Hopes deceive. The Daring Muse unbeaten Paths shall tread, In Visionary Dreams of Rapture led, Descend into the Regions of the Dead. Elysian Bow'rs, where Waller's well-tun'd Lire The Art of Numbers shall instruct the Quire, Where Milton on eternal Roses lies, Deep wrapt in Dreams of his own Paradise: Th'advent'rous Muse, with this kind Vision charm'd, And dear Concern for her lov'd Country warm'd, Of Secrets that to Britain's Peace belong, Shall question Fate, consult the Sacred Throng; And thro the dang'rous Course— The learn'd Couleian Shade direct her Song, The Victor crown, and to reward their Pain, Embalm and consecrate the noble Slain: If that low pitch to which my Voice can rise, May reach such Theams, and rural Notes suffice To please the Plain, is all my Hopes persue: The Palace has already had its due. A pleasant Battel between two Lap-Dogs of the Utopian Court. Or a Dialogue between Sleep and Awake, Jest and Earnest, Reality and Fancy: Being fought upon the new erected Dog-Pit, lately contriv'd purposely upon this Occasion as aforesaid in the Anti-Chamber of the said Court, where it was fought with great Applause, Satisfaction and Content of the Company there present: But by reason of the Author's Drowzy Disposition, being late at Night, and he inclin'd to sleep, he would crave your favourable Censure of this his Pains, and judg of them as you find occasion. Printed in 1681. Enter two Lap-Dogs, Tutty and Snap-short. Reader, Wise Æsop thought it no Mistake To make brute Beasts, as well as Men to speak: Why may not I, like him, in harmless Rhimes, Bring Brutes to speak against the brutish times? When Sin swells high, it needs a sharp Correction: I'll give you here a brief yet full Collection, By such a Catalogue of nasty Sin, As Sodom almost loath'd to wallow in: First, I present two Lap-Dogs on the Stage, Who strike the hidden Vices of the Age, With so much Vigour, as it will surprize Your Senses all, your Hearts, your Ears, your Eyes: The English Lap-Dog here does first begin The Vindication of his Lady Gw?n. The other much more Frenchify'd, alas, Shews what his Lady is, not what she was. From Words they rise to Blows, as People say, Occasioned a sharp and bloody Fray. The Ladies looking on, each back'd her Cur, Until they made such a foul filthy stir, As set all in an Uproar: this was Sport Did highly please the grand Utopian Court. The Battel being ended I awoke, And all the Vision vanish'd into Smoak. Tutty it seems beat Snap-short, and the Bell Tutty bears home in Victory: Farewel. Marvel's Ghost: Being a true Copy of a Letter sent to the A. Bp. of Cant. upon his sudden Sickness, at the Prince of Orange's first Arrival into London, 1688/9. The APOLOGY. When Men of God will do the Devil's Work, And frame new Prayers for Lewis and the Turk, In drunken Clubs religiously combine To make the lost Mack-Ninny's Right Divine, And the whole Town with Sham Distinctions ring Of a de Jure and de Facto King, And prate of Duty till they've lost the Thing: When those whose Business 'tis to preach up Peace, Labour to make our Discontents increase; Foment Divisions, and new Storms create; Defame the King and undermine the State, Which wou'd, were they but hang'd, be fortunate: What Indignation can be thought severe? How can a true-born English Muse forbear To lash their Folly, and correct their Vice, And teach the People whence their Plagues arise? How innocent and good soe'er they seem, The Source of all our Mischiefs lies in them. From them, as from Pandora's Box, they fly: 'Tis their corrupted Breath pollutes our Northern Sky. Therefore, my Lord, you justly can't accuse This modest Sally of a backward Muse, Which had been damn'd to Silence, and forgot, If you had not reviv'd it with your Plot. 'Twas writ to consolate your Sickness then; If you had mended this had ne'er been seen. But since you every Day grow worse and worse, And still resolve to be the Nation's Curse; I also am resolv'd to let you know, Here's one as stubborn and as bold as you. The GHOST. How just is then the Tribute of our Eyes! When Vertue languishes, and Goodness dies, When holy Prelacy from Court withdrawn, Lies sick at Lambeth in a Shroud of Lawn! Who fearing now, Compliance with the Prince Shou'd better Men to equal Power advance, With-holds his Hand, and in the very nick The humorous Prelate willingly falls sick. On what small Props a Churchman's health depends! Draw but one Pin and the whole Fabrick bends; Touch but their Wealth, their Power, or their Place, They'll snuff, and snort, and curse you to your Face. Has there a Mischief in the World been done, E'er since the odious Name of B? known, In which a Clergy-man has not been one! Have there been private Murders, publick Wars, Dividing Schisms or intestine Jars, Reproaches, Scandals, Goals, Fines, bloody Laws, Of which they have not been the chiefest Cause! Great Constantine, how basely hast thou stain'd Those glorious Laurels that thy Conquests gain'd! Untainted Honor with bright Lustre spread It self in shining Circles round thy Head, Which might have shone till now, belov'd, rever'd, In the same Tomb had B? been inter'd With lesser Villains; but nice Goodness spar'd Those Foes that should have the same Ruin shar'd: Those Sanctimonious Robbers that did more Infest the Church than Heathen Priests before: They with professed Malice Blood did spill; These pray, and smile, and flatter when they kill: They did their open Enemies annoy; These kiss the Friends they murder and destroy. By these opprest, the mournful Church implor'd The tardy Vengeance of thy backward Sword. Had this been done, had thy Imperial Frown But smote those haughty Mitred Monarchs down; Myriads of Blessings shou'd thy Reign adorn, Paid by past Ages, this and those unborn. Tell me, ye doting Bigots who revere These Raree Shows o'th' Church and Pageants here; Like Tinsel Mortals on a Gewgaw Stall, Fram'd for mere show and of no use at all: Tell me in sober seriousness, unvext, What Holiness is to their Cowl annext; What hidden Virtue in their Office lies, Unseen by Men of common Sense and Eyes! Did e'er a Bishoprick a Man advance Above the rest in Honour, Truth, and Sense! Or did a fat Advowson ever make A Man preach better and more labour take? They talkt indeed in very Loyal strain, To praise the King did God himself profane, But sure we ne'er shall hear of that again. Born to themselves, themselves alone they please, Steep't in the Sweets of Luxury and Ease: The Land they canton and divide the Spoil, And drain the moisture of our Wealthy Isle. For Pulpit Work let those who can do that, They're all too dull, too feeble, or too fat. Are these the Men that hope to govern now? To whom our Church and State again must bow? Have we then but the blessed Prospect seen Of dawning Peace, of a vast Gulph between? Like Men condemn'd, on flattering Hopes born high, To fall with greater Ruin from the Sky! Good God, forbid thy Church should e'er be sway'd By those again that have thy Truth betray'd: Who lately such a fatal Instance gave What precious Care they'd of Religion have, That durst adore a Fool and trust a Knave. Shou'd it be thus, how would our Isle complain, And beg to have our wandring King again? Intreat the worst his incens'd Rage can do, The less important Mischief of the two; Which is the cruel'st Beast will then be known, An English Pr?te or a French Dragoon. From hence, my Lord, you may with ease foreknow What Epitaphs we shall on such bestow: When such depart (when will just Heaven think fit To strike and do an injur'd Nation right!) The most obdurate Muse will strain a Verse, And bathe with Tears of Joy each Bishop's Herse. A Congratulatory Poem to the Reverend Dr. John Tillotson, upon his Promotion to the Arch-Episcopal See of Canterbury, 1691. Whilst Priestly Pens the Glorious Theam decline, And at their Loss, or at your Fate repine; And College-Wits no tuneful Notes express, Are drunk in Faction, or unskill'd in Verse; I, who the Levite seldom did adore, And scarce e'er knew a Priest I lov'd before, Do to your Fame a juster Tribute bring, At once the Prelate and his Vertues sing. 'Twas but of late my Warbling Lute I strung, And mighty Orange in just Numbers sung; Did with the wondring World in Notes rejoice, And prais'd our Maker's and the People's Choice. Now the dear sweets of fresher Joys commence, And for the Prelate we must bless the Prince. Methinks the Vertue of our Land appears After the Luxury of Thirty Years, When close Opinions set the Prelate forth, And 'twas his Faction rais'd him, not his Worth. A juster Path our righteous Prince did tread, Destin'd the Mitre for a nobler Head: He shall unvanquish'd on the Plain command, When such a Bishop does support his Hand: Home from the Wars shall lasting Trophies bear, For Heav'n will grant a righteous Prelate's Pray'r. On you, Great Sir, our Pious Hopes depend, Your Learning must our Rational Faith defend; We fear no Fate, resolv'd to overcome Beneath your Banner, who have conquer'd Rome. Whilst mighty William draws his Shining Sword To fight God's Battels, you maintain his Word; He skill'd in War, with manly Prowess arm'd, Has each good Man and every Nation charm'd; Your Skill in Argument is not unknown, Nor the great Feats your Artful Pen has done; Altho Religion seem'd to bid adieu, Its Resurrection we expect from you. Religion first with dazling Rays did shine, Her Shape was comely, and her Face divine; Her Native Beauty each Admirer warm'd, E'er Stains of Error had her Mien deform'd, And Clouds of Ignorance, that Truth o'erspread, Hover'd in gloomy Circles round her Head. You are the Sun that must dispel these Mists, Revive Religion, and reform our Priests; Curb all our Vices, and impede their Growth, So long debauch'd in Luxury and Sloth. You are the Moses must our Factions quell, And stop the murmuring of our Israel. At your Advancement pious Souls rejoice, No more the Monarch's than the People's Choice. Before the King's Decree was fully known, Methought each Look declar'd for TILLOTSON: But when 'twas known, each Man his Joy exprest, And thank'd the Monarch for so good a Priest. Each distant Place receiv'd the joyful Sound, Where the glad News a hearty Welcome found. Tho diff'rent Sects too much infest our Land, And with hot Zeal for either Party stand; Tho the Devotes too mad and rigid are, There ne'er appear'd a rash Dissenter here. The Prelate all approve, the Man caress, And for his Choice their rightful Monarch bless. Let envious Priests your Glories strive to blast, Fixt as some Rock your Memory shall last. No stubborn Levites shall molest your Fame, But yours shall grow, as mighty William's Name. The stubborn Levites are our Land's Disgrace, A haughty, proud, and a contentious Race; Byass'd in Judgment, turbulent in Mind, No King can please, nor Acts of Grace can bind; Promote our Wars with vast Expence of Blood, Prefer their Humour to their Country's Good. If these reproach, the Venom of their Gall Beneath the weight of your Contempt must fall. All the Reproaches of the Wicked must Tend to the Praises of the Good and Just. Who knows the Vice to Envy does belong, Wou'd loath the Slanders of a railing Tongue: The Glory of your Vertue shines more bright, And scorns the Darkness of approaching Night: 'Tis not the tainted Breath of envious Fame, Can blast the Beauties of your spotless Name; You need not value what the Gloomy say, The Clouds may darken, not obstruct the Day; The lofty Pine, with Head erect, does grow, Nor heeds the Motion of the Shrubs below. On in its course the constant Moon still jogs, Disdains the barking Neighbourhood of Dogs. When Vertue is oppos'd by vicious Might, It shews its Force, and shines with double Light, Vertue, like Camomile oppress'd, still lives, The more 'tis trod, the better Scent it gives. What tho you're hated and contemn'd by few, The Many to your Cause and Faith are true; In vain the Bad their weak disgust exprest, Since you are lov'd, supported by the best. Scarce had our Royal Pair a greater Train, To give the Scepter of a gentle Reign, Than that the Prelate has so lately grac'd, Who gave the Crosier, and the Miter plac'd; The Nobler Throng led the Imperial way, Scarce could Maria's Charms command their Stay; To see the Rites perform'd they all resort, Less'ning the Numbers of the crouded Court. From ev'ry part the glad Admirers throng, And bless the Prelate as they pass along. Thus once the ransom'd People fill'd the Strand, O'erspread the Beach, to see Great Orange land; He brought ten thousand Blessings to the Shoar, Great as the Miseries we felt before; Remov'd our Scourges, and destroy'd our Rods, And triumph'd o'er our Wooden Priests and Gods. The joyful People soon his Praises sing, With one united shout proclaim him King. Scarce did they more rejoice to see the Crown Plac'd on a Head was chosen by their own, Than now they triumph when the Mitre's given To one approv'd by People, Prince, and Heav'n. But now, my Lord! the mighty Work is done, And Heav'n with Blessings does the Action crown; The joyful News fills every distant Plain, And glads the Heart of every humble Swain. We from your Learning do expect the Truth, To help the Aged, and instruct the Youth; And hope your good Example will afford The same Success as mighty VVilliam's Sword; Conquer the Lusts and Vices of the Age, Asswage their Fury, and appease their Rage: To stop a Torrent, when the Waves combine, Requires a Courage and a Heat Divine: To dare their Force, and with address withstand The impious Fury of a Sinful Land: Such mighty Actions never can be done, But by the Hands of such as Tillotson; 'Tis not an easy step to mount a Throne, And pull an old Imperious Tyrant down. Sin, like a Tyrant, with its Scepter reigns, And all the pious Strength of Man disdains; A num'rous Train does to its Courts belong, Its Slaves are valiant and its Vot'ries strong: Just like a rightful Monarch it appears, And pleads Succession of some hundred Years; Does for all Leudness and each Vice declare, And against Grace proclaims an open War; All its strong holds with Art does fortify, And forms a Train of its Artillery, Of Lust, Ambition, and insatiate Pride, Of Malice and ten thousand Ills beside; Longing for Death, and thirsting after Blood, And the Destruction of each thing that's Good. This is the Enemy, my Lord, you must Destroy, and lay its Honour in the Dust; Retrieve the Praise of Thred-bare Vertue's Fame, And give't a glorious and immortal Name. 'Tis true, the Business and the Work is hard, But great's your Help, and great is your Reward. The Mighty VVilliam did the Scepter sway, When Men were stubborn, and refus'd t'obey; A Moody People in a Nation rul'd, Had been with Folly and with Leudness gull'd: So good, so mild, so gentle was his Sway, The Major Part soon learned to obey. Nor is the Hierarchy, where you command, Much less infested with the Sins o'th' Land; Despotick Sway of late o'ercame the Law, And we the Ruin of our Freedoms saw: Then grave Divinity became a Cheat, And fell and dwindled to I know not what: Some for Preferment had their Faith forgot, And gave their Hand to carry on the Plot; Some Braves indeed (and these were not a few) Kept to their Doctrines and their Country true, Oppos'd our Foes, and our Restorer serv'd, And never yet have from his Interest swerv'd. The Glory of our Faith you must retrieve, And a new Life must to Religion give, And make our Clergy good Examples live. Thus by your Sway we hope for better Times, Men shall hate Vice, and shall abandon Crimes; The Shame of Sinning shall its Use unlearn, And Men by Vertue shall their Worth discern: The Priests no longer shall be steep'd in Sloth, And 't shall be Scandal to refuse the Oath; Nor shall Opinion one another blame, The Wolf shall slumber with the tender Lamb; Our Tuneful Bards exalted Notes shall raise, And sing the Monarch's, and the Bishop's Praise. The Earth-quake of Jamaica, describ'd in a Pindarick Poem, 1692. By Mr. TUTCHIN. I. Well may our Lives bear an uncertain Date; Disturb'd with Maladies within, Without by cross Events of Fate, The worst of Plagues on Mortals wait, Pride, Ignorance, and Sin. If our antient Mother Earth, Who gave us all untimely Birth, Such strong Hysterick Passion feels; If Orbs are from their Axles torn, And Mountains into Valleys worn, All in a Moment's space; Can Humane Race Stand on their Legs when Nature reels? Unhappy Man! in all things cross'd, On every giddy Wave of Fortune toss'd: The only thing that aims at Sway, And yet capricious Fate must still obey; Travels for Wealth to Foreign Lands, O'er scorching Mountains, and o'er Desart Sands, Laden with Gold, when homeward bound, Is in one vast impetuous Billow drown'd: Or if he reaches to the Shoar, And there unlades his Oar, Builds Towns and Houses which may last and stand, Thinking no Wealth so sure as the firm Land; Yet Fate the Animal does still pursue; This slides from underneath his Feet, and leaves him too. II. Environ'd with Ten thousand Fears we live, For Fate do's seldom a just Warning give; Quicker than Thought its dire Resolves are made, And swift as Lightning flies, Around the vast extended Skies: All things are by its Bolts in vast Confusion laid. Sometimes a flaming Comet does appear, Whose very Visage does pronounce Decay of Kingdoms, and the Fall of Crowns, Intestine War, or Pestilential Year; Sometimes a Hurricane of Fate Does on some Great Man's Exit wait, A murder'd Cornish, or some Hercules, When from their Trunks Almighty Jove, Who breaks with Thunder weighty Clouds above, To honour these, Large Pines and Oaks does lop, And in a Whirlwind lays 'em upon Oeta's Top. E'er this vast Orb shall unto Chaos turn, And with consuming Flames shall burn, An Angel Trumpeter shall come, Whose Noise shall shake the Massy Ground, In one short Moment shall express His Notes to the whole Universe; The very Dead shall hear his Sound, And from their Graves repair To the Impartial Bar; Those that have been in the deep Ocean drown'd, Shall at his Call come to receive their Doom. III. But here, alas! no Omens fly, No secret Whisper of their Destiny Was heard; none cou'd divine When Fate wou'd spring the Mine: Safe and secure the Mortals go, Not dreaming of a Hell below, In the dark Caverns of the gloomy Earth, Where suffocating Sulphur has its Birth, And sparkling Nitre's made; Where Vulcan and his Cyclops prove The Thunderbolts they make for Jove. Here Æolus his Winds has laid, Here is his Windy Palace, here 'tis said His Race of little puffing Gods are bred, Which serve for Bellows to blow up the Flame. The dire Ingredients are in order plac'd, Which must anon lay Towns and Cities waste. Strait the black Engineer of Heaven came, His Match a Sun-beam was, He swift as Time unto the Train did pass, It soon took Fire; the Fire and Winds contend, But both concur the Vaulted Earth to rend; It upwards rose, and then it downwards fell, Aiming at Heaven, it sunk to Hell: The Neighb'ring Seas now own no more The sturdy Bulwarks of the Shoar; The gaping Earth and greedy Sea, Are both contending for the Prey; Those whom the rav'nous Earth had ta'ne Into her Bowels back again, Are wash't from thence by the insulting Main. IV. The Old and Young receive alike their Doom, The Cowards and the Brave Are buried in one Grave; For Fate allows 'em all one Common Tomb. The Aged and the Wise Lose all their Reason in the great Surprise. They know not where to go, And yet they dare not stay, There's Fire and Smoak below, And the Earth gaping to receive the Prey. If to the Houses Top they crawl, These tumble too, and downwards fall: And if they fly into the Street, There grizly Death they meet; All in a hurry die away, The Wicked had not time to pray. The Soldier once cou'd teach grim Death to kill, In vain is all his Skill, In vain he brandisheth his Steel: No more the Art of War must teach, But lies Fate's Trophy underneath the Breach: The good Companions now no more carouse, They share the Fate of the declining House, Healths to their Friends their Bumpers crown'd: But while they put the Glasses round, Death steps between the Cup and Lip, Nor would it let 'em take one parting Sip. V. The Mine is sprung, and a large Breach is made, Whereat strong Troops of Warring Seas invade; These overflow; Where Houses stood, and Grass did grow, All sorts of Fish resort: They had Dominions large enough before, But now unbounded by the Shoar, They o'er the Tops of Houses sport. The watry Fry their Legions do extend, And for the new slain Prey contend; Within the Houses now they roam, Into their Foe, the very Kitchen, come. One does the Chimney-hearth assail, Another flaps the Kettle with his slimy Tail. No Image there of Death is seen, No Cook-maid does obstruct their Sway, They have entirely got the Day. Those who have once devour'd been By Mankind, now on Man do feed: Thus Fate decides, and steps between, And sometimes gives the Slave the Victor's Meed. The beauteous Virgins whom the Gods might love, Cou'd not the Curse of Heav'n remove; Their Goodness might for Crimes atone, Inexorable Death spares none. Their tender Flesh lately so plump and good, Is now made Fishes and Sea-monsters Food; In vain they cry, Heav'n is grown deaf, and no Petition hears, Their Sighs are answer'd like their Lovers Pray'rs, They in the Universal Ruin lie. VI. Nor is inexorable Fate content To ruine one poor Town alone; More Mischief by the Blow is done: Death's on a farther Message sent. When Fate a Garison does sack, The very Suburbs do partake Of Martial Law, Its Forces draw To every Mountain, Field and Wood; They ravage all the Neighborhood. Worse than the weak Assaults of Steel, Its Instruments of Death all Places feel. They undiscover'd, like fell Poison kill, Its Warriors fierce, The Earth, the Air, and Men do pierce; And mounted, fight upon the winged Winds. Here a great Mountain in a Valley's thrown, And there a Valley to a Mountain grown. The very Breath of an incensed God Makes even proud Olympus nod. Chang'd is the Beauty of the fruitful Isle, And its fair Woods lop'd for its Funeral Pile, The moving Earth forms it self into Waves, And curls its Surface like the rolling Seas; Whilst Man (that little thing) so vainly Raves, Nothing but Heaven can its own Wrath appease. VII. But Fate at length thought fit to leave its Toil, And greedy Death was glutted with the Spoil. As weary Soldiers having try'd their Steel, Half drown'd with Blood, do then desist to kill. More Ruin wou'd a second Deluge make, Blot out the Name of the unhappy Isle. It fares with her, as when in Martial Field, Resolv'd and Brave, and loth to yield, Two numerous Armies do contend, And with repeated Shouts the Air do rend. Whilst the affrighted Earth does shake, Some large Battalions are entirely lost, And warring Squadrons from the mighty Host: Here by a Shot does fall Some Potent General; And near to him Another loses but a Limb. Part of the Island was a Prey to Fate, And all the rest do's but prolong its Date, 'Till injur'd Heaven finds Its Bolts a Terror strike on Human Minds; Sure we may hope the Sinners there repent, Since it has made their leudest Priest relent. Midsummer-Moon: or the Livery-Man's Complaint, 1682. I cannot hold, hot struggling Rage aspires, And crouds my free-born Breast with noble Fires. Whilst prudent Fools squeak Treason thro the Nose, And whine a quivering Vote in sneaking Prose, My Muse soars out of reach, and dares despise What e'er below attempts to tyrannize. Tho I by some base Nero should be clad In such a Gown as the old Christians had, In Clouds of Satyr up to Heav'n I'de roll; For he could burn my Shell, but not my Soul. Tho Nature her auspicious Aid refuse, Revenge and Anger shall inspire my Muse: Nature has giv'n me a complaining part, And bleeding England a resenting Heart. Let creeping Play'rs, whose pliant Fancies can Sneak to the Devil, and call him Gentleman; How long has Northern Air so Sovereign been To purge the Plot, and sanctify a Sin? 'Tis well for England, if at last it find The Traitor's Noxious Humours left behind, Which long have been fomented by the Spoil Of that old-fashion'd honest Fool Argyle, Who lost a noble Fortune, on pretence Of a fond thing the Whigs call Conscience. His Fall, and Thynn's, if rightly understood, Were only doom'd to flesh the Hounds in Blood. The Way's chalkt out, tho Fear retard the Blow, 'Tis plain, that once a Rogue and ever so. Treason's the Gangrene of a mounting Soul, Which, if not soon cut off, infects the Whole. Tho Heav'n in Anger sometimes may relieve, Pardons still do not follow a Reprieve. Not fell Charibdis, Godwins, and the Ore, If Fate ordain't, shall keep a Prince from Shoar; Since he that would by Brother's Blood be crown'd, Shall (tho in Egg-shell Frigat) ne'er be drown'd. Which stockt Seraglio's, and rich Grand Viziers, Th'industrious Tory truck for Officers. In sober sadness, Sirs, how goes the Price? Are Sheriffs lately grown good Merchandize? Sure, Brethren, we may fear the Cause is low, When you for Cordials unto Turkey go: When nothing else the desperate Game retrieves, You'l chuse the City Circumcised Shrieves: To whom, if you would take Advice from me, Good Father Elliot should a Chaplain be. Some Mufties too you might have wafted o're, But that with B?ps we were stockt before, High rampant, swearing B?ps, tite and true, Brisk B?ps, who have their Seraglioes too; Who'll bid, e'er Ghostly Codpiece find rebuke, Two hundred pounds a Year above a Duke; Who, if their Piety were open set, Are verier Turks than Bishop Mahomet: Who arm'd with Sword for Pen, and Male for Gown, With cogent Blows knock reeling Error down. Had you some Aids of Janizaries got, Or some bold Troops from the Timariot, These better would have merited Rewards, Than all your Ruby-nos'd and Whoring Guards; Who tho to fight they could not find a Heart, Most nobly would discharge the plundring Part. Then we shall get as Loyal Sheriffs, when The Lousy Regiments are Livery-men. Now you by Law may freely take a Purse, For one upon the Bench will vouch it, Sirs. Claw me, and I'll claw thee; what, he's his Brother! And one Good-turn, ye know, deserves another: For that old Fox most prudently decreed To get a pow'rful Friend in time of need; That when he Newgate Fate approaching sees, He may perswade him to refund his Fees; Or, if they cannot here securely trade, Sneak back with him, and turn a Renegade. Poor Tories! have you none but him in store, Who's now been thum'b so oft he'll hold no more? Can you provide no better Partner than An Unbeliever for a Mussulman? Those are but mungrel Turks (to tell you true) Who love not Christian better than a Jew; And, if they will not take a Friend's Advice, Shall ne'er come into Mahomet's Paradise. Degenerate London! Slave to Mighty Pelf! Degenerate London! Stranger to thy Self! Are these thy Senators? thy Fathers sage? Sure, if they are, they dote with Gold and Age. There was, alas! there was a time when we Esteem'd our Lives below our Liberty; When, if our dying Country we could save, We'ad sung on Tombs, &amp; triumph'd on the Grave, Joyfully fal'n on her beloved Face, And perish'd in our Mother's dear Imbrace. That nobler Ardour long ago is fled; The Slaves are living, and the Heroes dead. We peep into the Hall, and whoop, and then, Fools as we went, like Fools come back agen: For Shrieves, like Larks in falling Skies, we gape, And dance Attendance on the Courtier's Ape, Who (poor good-natur'd Soul) can neither have Honesty for the Fool, nor Wit for Knave. He's a strange piece of Linsy-Woolsy Ware, Just such another thing as B?ps are. When he on lofty Ten-toes did advance, And thro the Streets on foot-back proudly prance, Circled around by all the ragged Rout, Who loud Huzza's, and, Bless your Lordship, shout; Absent from J?s, H?x, and all That in his Ears for ever buz and bawl; Then he his Loyal Carcase did undress, And unto Ghostly Mother thus confess: The Work is done, I ought to swear 'em too; But, O! I shall be chidden if I do. Some-body terrifies me twice and once, And frights me with Raw-head and Bloody-bones. But if I'm good, he calls me Love and Joy, And tells me, There's my dainty Golden Boy! Gives me a Pipe and Cart to truckle in, And strokes my Head, and chucks me under Chin: And also promis'd the next time he comes, To bring his Pocket full of Sugar-Plumbs. Nay, once in Verity he past his Word, To make my Honourable Knaveship, Lord; Spight of my Teeth, he made me Truant play, And to White-Hall kidnap'd my Lord away; There such paw Words so terribly he sed, As with strange Proclamations fill'd my Head; I'll imitate great Lucifer, and be A Tyrant far more absolute than he, Who never could a Common-Council call, Nor domineer like me in Heaven's Guild-Hall; Nor yet in the Crown-Office put the Stars, Nor Angels prosecute for Rioters. Well, if at last I find the House too hot, And Master J?ry needs must go to pot, Worst come to th'worst, it only shall be said, I wisely hang'd my self, to save my Head. Thus said, on gilded Couches sinking down, Sleep seiz'd his Corps, and laid his empty Crown. Thro all the tedious Hours of baleful Night, Guilt gnaws his Soul with many a gastly Spright. Disloyal Morpheus did at first present The horrid Spectre of a Parliament; Five hundred Heads adorn its mighty Chest, Millions of Noble Hearts inform the Breast; Millions of Hands defend the Sacred Throne, Bravely resolv'd to make its Grave their own: Poor He at their Tribunal quivering stood, Guilt lockt his Veins, and Fear congeal'd his Blood; But what was done or said by him, or these, I cannot tell you till their Masters please. The next that gave his Memory a rub, Were Two produc'd in City Sweating-Tub, Who that they might appear for North and Box, Were us'd like rotten Courtiers with a P?x; Within his Bannio they were forc'd to stay, Till choak'd with heat, their Souls did melt away; Bequeathing him the Peoples weighty Hate, Sure Omen of a far severer Fate. The next that discompos'd his Lordship's Naps, Was a whole show'r of dreadful Shoulder-Claps; Action they still a top of Action pack, Almost enough to break a Camel's Back; Hundreds of thousand Pounds! St. J?s defend us, Or these unconscionable Whigs will end us: So great a noise these Counter-Devils did keep, As fright his doughty Lordship out of sleep: For a Court-Journey he again provides, Saddles his Cane, and then gets up and rides, To the Cabal he hastily does go, Still crying Westminster and Lambeth, hoa. What there he did, Fanaticks must not tell: But if you'd know, pray ask Sir Lionel. Room for the Chap-faln Mouth, or else 'twill swear, By all the Aps from Saint Cadwallader, Prute's hur creat Cranfather, if hur enquire, And Adam's Cranfather was Prutus Sire. Famous ap Shenkin was hur elder Prother, Some Caledonian Sycorax hur Mother, Or some she-Deel more damn'd than all the rest, At their black Feast hur lustful Sire comprest; Thence this incarnate Cacodæmon rose, Whose very Face his Parents Image shows: His Shape was all inhuman, and uncouth, But yet he's chiefly Devil about the Mouth. With care they nurs'd the Brat, for fear it shou'd Grow tame, and so degen'rate into good; With City Charters him they wrapt about, And Acts of Parliament for Swadling-Clout. As he grew up, he won a Noble Fame, Well worthy of the Brood from whence he came; Cherishing Spite, and hugging Discord fell, He was the best-beloved Brat of Hell. Oft with Success this Mighty Blast did bawl, Where loudest Lungs and longest Swords win all; And still his clenched Arguments did end With that home thrust, He is not Cæsar's Friend. Sometimes, that jaded Ears he might release, Good Man! he has been fee'd to hold his Peace. Hear him, but never see him, and you'd swear He was the Cryer, not the Counsellor. He roars, as if he only chanc't to find Justice was now grown deaf as well as blind. This demy Fiend, this Hurricane of Man, Must shatter London's Glory (if he can?) This Engineer must with his forked Crown For Battering Ram, beat all her Bulwarks down. And him our prudent Prætor wisely chose To splutter Law, and the dinn'd Rabble pose; They have a thousand Tongues, yet he can roar Far louder, tho they had a thousand more. Unto long-winded Cook he scorns to go, But pleads, His Majesty will have it so. Counsel alone, for such a Client fit, As fam'd for Honesty as he for Wit. Well, quoth Sir G. the Whigs may think me rude, Or brand me guilty of Ingratitude; At my Preferment they (poor Fools) may grudg, And think me fit for Hangman, more than Judg; But tho they fret, and bite their Nails, and bawl, I'll slight them, and go kiss dear Nelly Wall. Dalila is to Court return'd, and I, Blest with her Influence, all the World defy; I'm made, whilst Sampson wantons in her Lap: Such Favorites are Wh??s, so charming is a Clap. But hold! what makes the gaping Many run? Is France defeated? or, is Rome undone? Is Portsmouth Nun, or Kate a Mother grown? Will conscientious Comyn swear for none? Have Poets quite forgot to smooth, and glose, And lead admiring Cullies by the Nose? Have we a War with Monsieur, Peace with Spain, Or, have we got a Parliament again? All in good time, when Heav'n &amp; Charles shall please. But 'tis a Wonder greater far than these: Were not our Shreeves the greatest Sots alive, To question my Lord Mayor's Prerogative, Who is (if all that Tories say be true) The wisest Lord that ever London knew? And aided by some musty Laws, dispute With him that is, or would be, Absolute. Tho that's (if due to one) to One alone, Unless the Hustings could commence a Throne. Rave whilst they will, he'l make the City stay; Because 'tis Great and Lordly to Delay. Our Pleasure is, that you no longer sit, But go, and meet again when We think fit. When Will and Pleasure could not ought prevail, Away he trots to tell the woful Tale. On Marrow-bones he sadly begs for pity; Pray, Sir! I can't be quiet for the City. They hunch, and punch, and hit me many a Pat, And throw one down, and dirt one's Bever-Hat. Th'uncomplaisant Phanaticks neither care For sage Sir J??n, nor L. nor M??r, nor M?a?r. Wo to the naughty Boy that's such a noddy, T'abuse him who says nothing to no body. The Shreeves must come, and in one live-long hour, Præsto, they'r conjur'd into' enchanted Tower: But four small Devils did hoist 'em on their backs; Behold the Policy of Hallifax: Who makes the Protestants Devotion thus, From Hell, and Hull, and Him, deliver us. That Sham won't take, Sir; for what e'er you do, We know our Strength, but know our Duty too. At these fine little Tricks of State we laugh; For such old Birds are seldom caught with Chaff. Yet tho whole droves of Locusts you provide, With ten and twenty Regiments beside; Tho they shou'd batter down our Towers &amp; Walls (As once before) with Teuxbury Mustard Balls; We've Noble Hearts dare leap into a Flame, With a bold Traitor's Blood to quench the same, With parting Breath curse all the Friends to Rome, And in some Temple's Ruins find a Tomb. Nor you Familiars shall forgotten be, Altho unworthy of my Verse and Me; You who that Honourable Fool command, And finely manage him by slight of hand. Billy look to't, e'er Parliament come on Let you and Neighbour Jemmy get you gon. Rouse up ye Tories of the Factious Age, Implicit Clappers to the Bawdy Stage: Du?b's an Ass to think these mighty Men Would take such store of pains for Nine or Ten; When your dear Patrons to Preferment rise, Moloch must have a larger Sacrifice; Hundreds of Hecatombs shall grace his Shrine, Whilst you huzza in Blood instead of Wine; Whilst from their holes the Waspish Whigs you burn, And every Sign-post to a Gibbet burn. Degenerate Albion! Ah! is this thy Son? This thy degenerate Off-spring, Albion! Canst thou without a Cloud of Blushes see The Follies of thy spurious Progeny? Is not the Man a Hero, bold and brave, That damns his Race, &amp; dooms his Grandchild Slave? Does not our Loyal Lord deserve to pass, For what he is indeed, a Loyal Ass? Are not our dearest Friends, the plodding Whigs, Old Dogs at Politicks and State-Intrigues, Who split again upon the self-same Shelves, And sweat to twist a Rope to hang themselves? One would have thought the Port wherewith he goes, And Chain and all, enough to fright his Foes! 'Tis true, he scorns to fear, or take Affront, But looks as big as Bully Rodomont. For who the Valour and the Force can tell, That waits upon the Name of Colonel? But yet to curb Fanaticks Discontent, Guards must be drawn up ready to present; Yet tho he's so courageous, he's so wise, That none but Friends know where his Valour lies. Poor Soul-less thing! alike contemn'd and curst, By some Court-sneaking Devil inform'd at first, Under what sickly Planet wer't thou born, Doom'd at thy Birth thy Nation's Plague and Scorn? Did sullen Saturn rule the sooty Sky, Or frowning Mars his Car run rumbling by? No Manlike Power would then vouchsafe to sway, Some Woman-God usurp'd th'unlucky Day; Unconstant Luna's Force did then prevail In close Conjunction with the Dragon's Tail. Poor Soul-less thing! thee cross-grain'd Nature gave, To make the Land a Scourge, the Court a Slave; Thy Country's Bane, the States-man's Wooden-Tool, More Fool than Knave, and yet more Knave than Fool. Like farting Pythia, thou art nothing else But a mere Trunk to Satan's Oracles: Still mayst thou live, but live in fear and pain, And live to see a Parliament again. Ah, too too happy London! didst thou know, And bless the Arm Divine that made thee so; Planted by Heav'n in a Luxuriant Soil, The Paradise of all this fruitful Isle; With Air-invading Turrets proudly crown'd, With Thames's ouzy Arms begirt around, With Silver Thames, who smooths his Aged Face When hasting to his Darling's dear Embrace; Bearing the Traffick of the home-spun West, As a Love-token to adorn her Breast. On his proud Neck he takes the irksome Chain, And still rolls back to kiss her Shores again; Indulgent Mothers so, long Tales will tell, And give their parting Sons a long Farewel! The gentle Naiads for her Sight prepare, And in their Chrystal Mirrour curl their Hair; Their purling Streams, and bubling Rills advance, And round the Sedges deckt with Osiers dance. Their Brooks and Ponds of skaly Subjects drain, For Presents to enrich their Soveraign; The stately Nereids with the swelling Tide, Rich Freights from all the Universe provide, Whate'er of Rarities the East can shew, With all the glittering Intrails of Peru; Cargoes of Myrrh and Frankincense they bring, And Pearls and Diamonds for an Offering: And when a Storm is rais'd, to make their Peace, E'en their own Corals and their Amber grease: Nor yet this Cabinet, tho bright, had been Admir'd, but for the nobler Gems within; Not all the Indies Charms enough can find To please and satisfy a Vertuous Mind. For Wealth without our Liberties would be But painted Chains, and gilded Slavery; To make her Happiness compleat and whole, The Gods inspir'd her with a generous Soul; Her Free-born Off-spring still was great and brave, Too low for Rebel, but too high for Slave; Who both of Right and Duty sense did feel, And could Bow low, but rather burst than Kneel. Amongst this purer Wheat some Tares did breed, Some Cockle, and encroaching Darnel Seed; A vip'rous Brood, who smiling Poison give To those indulgent Friends who made 'em live; Cut out for France, or some ignobler Place, Where Tyrants Chains are counted no disgrace. Nature found Stuff for Men, and wrought it right, But Heaven denies to give a Human Sprite. Some Sparks of Fire she like Prometheus stole, And wanting better, gave a Chicken's Soul; Or what did by late Transmigration pass From some contented Slave, or golden Ass. These (Bleeding London) all thy Bliss destroy, These stab thy Hopes, and murder all thy Joy: These not content with what themselves could do, To please the Devil, would damn their Neighbours too. But thou (great Charles!) whose glorious Wain dos rove Round our Horizon, next to none but Jove, With Royal Goodness hear their humble Suit, Who fain would love thee, if thou'dst let 'em do't; I beg no Favour, I expect no Bays, Bare Truth gets Frowns, gilt Lyes have Coin and Praise; Could I the Art of thy great Laureat win, To wash a Moor, or blanch a blacker Sin, Then might I nobly swear and whore in State, And e'en bid fair for Wealth in spite of Fate; But tho my thredbare Muse would fain be trying, Yet all, like him, have not the Gift of Lying. Oh, hear thy bleeding Subjects Groans &amp; Sighs, If not their Tongues, yet hear their flowing Eyes; Pity their too well-grounded Griefs and Fears, Mov'd by the silent Rhetorick of their Tears: O let the charming Devil tempt on in vain, Appear thy self, and break th'ignoble Chain; Shake the Court Ear-wiggs from thy pester'd Throne, Shake off thy little Kings, and reign alone: So mayst thou see thy Flatterers fall, and see Those that are Friends to Law are Friends to thee; So mayst thou bring poor England glad Relief, To right her Wrongs, and banish all her Grief: Till crown'd with Suns and Beams of peaceful Day, Attendent Angels thee to Bliss convey; Thither tho late (late let it be) remove, And change this Diadem for one more bright above. May thy surviving Image ever be (If possible) as much belov'd as Thee. May After-ages his great Sons admire, For England's Darlings and the World's Desire; For sworn eternal Foes to France and Rome, In a long, long Succession down to th'day of Doom. A SATYR against Brandy. Written by Jo. Hains, as he saith himself, 1683. Farewel damn'd Stygian Juice, who dost bewitch From the Court Baud, down to the Country Bitch: Thou liquid Flame, by whom each fiery Face Lives without Meat, and blushes without Grace: Sink to your native Hell, and mend the Fire, Or, if you rather chuse to settle nigher, Return to the dull Clime from whence you came, Where Wit and Courage may require your Flame, Where they carouze in your Vesuvian Bowls, To crust the Quagmire of their spungy Souls. Had Dives for thy scorching Moisture cry'd, Abr'am in Mercy had his suit deny'd: Or Bonner known thy Force; the Martyr's Blood Had siss'd in thee and sav'd the Nation's Wood. Essence of Embers, Scum of melting Flint, With all the Native Sparkles floating in't. Sure the black Chymist with the Cloven Foot, All Ætna's Simples in his Limbeck put, And double still'd, nay quintessenc'd thy Juice, To charcoal Mortals for his future use. Fire-ship to Nature, who dost doubly wound, For those that grapple thee, are burnt and drown'd. As when Heav'n press'd th'Auxiliaries of Hell, A flaming Storm on cursed Sodom fell; And when its single Plagues could not prevail, Egypt was scal'd with kindled Rain and Hail: So Nature's Feuds are reconcil'd in Thee, Thou two great Judgments in Epitomy: God's past and future Anger breathes in you, A Deluge and a Conflagration too. View yonder Sot (I don't mean Sheriff Sh?te) Grilly'd all o'er by thee from Head to Foot: His drousy Eyelids shoar'd above their pitch, His Cheeks with Carbuncles and Rubies rich; His Scull instead of Brains supply'd with Cinder, His Nose turns all his Handkerchiefs to Tinder: He breathes like a Smith's Forge, and wets the Fire, Not to allay the Flame, but raise it higher: His trembling Hands scarce heave the Liquor in, His Nerves all crackle in his Parchment Skin; His Stomach don't concoct, but bake his Food; His Liver even vitrifies his Blood; His Guts from Nature's Drudgery are freed, And in his Bowels Salamanders breed. He's grown too hot to think, too dull to laugh, And steps as if he walk'd with Pindar's Staff. The moving Glass-house lightens with his Eyes, Singes his Clothes, and all his Marrow fries; Glows for a while, and then in Ashes dies. Thus like a sham Prometheus, we find Thou steal'st a Fire from Hell to kill Mankind. But hold—lest we the Saints dire Anger merit, By stinting their Auxiliary Spirit: We hear of late, whate'er the wicked think, Thou art reform'd and turn'd a Godly Drink: And doubtless thou'rt con-natural to them, For both thy Spirit and theirs abound in Phlegm; 'Ere since the Publick Faith for Plate did wimble, And sanctify'd thy Gill with Hannah's Thimble: Thou left'st thy old bad Company of Vermin, The drunken Porters, and the swearing Carmen, And the leud Drivers of the Hackny Coaches, And now tak'st up with sage discreet Debauches: Thou freely drop'st upon Gold Chains and Fur, And Sots of Quality thy Minions are. No more shalt thou foment an Ale-house Brawl, But the more sober Riots at Guild-hall, Where, by thy Spirit's fallible Direction, The Reprobates stood polling for Election. If this Trade holds, what will the Wicked do? The Saints sequester e'en their Vices too: For since the Art of Whoring's grown precise, And Perjury hath got demurer Eyes; 'Tis time, high time to circumcise the Gill, And not let Drinking be Philistian still. Go then, thou Emblem of their torrid Zeal, Add Flame to Flame, and their stiff Tempers neal, Till they grow ductile to the Publick Weal. And since the Godly have espous'd thy Cause, Don't fill their Heads with Liberties and Laws, Religion, Privilege, and lawless Charters, Mind them of Falstaff's Heir apparent Garters, And keep their outward Man from Ketches Quarters. One Caution more (now we are out of hearing) Many have died of Drinking, some of Swearing; If these two Pests should in Conjunction meet, The Grass wou'd quickly grow in every Street: Save thou the Nation from that double Blow, And keep thy Fire from Salamanca TO. The Grove: Or, the Rival Muses, 1701. Divine Thalia! Charmer of my Breast, To whom I fly, when with rude Cares opprest: Thou only vernal Virgin of the Nine, Who mak'st the Spring with blooming Glories shine; And pleas'd with Gardens and a silent Grove, Inspir'st the Swains with Gaity and Love. Renew thy Favours, teach me to relate The Shepherd's Love, the Nymph's dissembled Hate; How he and Cycnus by the Moon's pale Light, With rival Songs, beguil'd the passing Night: And with what Joy the Youth forsook the Shade, And ran t'embrace the dear relenting Maid. His yearly Race bright Phœbus thrice had run, And now again the radiant Course begun, Since Love-sick Theron turn'd a Shepherd Swain, To feed a Flock, and play a rural Strain. To higher Notes at first his Harp he strung, And of immortal Gods and Heroes sung: Till in a swift pursuit of Love, and Fame, A fond Endeavour, and a hapless Flame! In thought secure (hard Fate!) he chanc'd to find The Town, and Celia both at once unkind. One sooth'd him on with hopes of coming Joys, The other bid him snatch the falling Bays: But soon the false, inconstant Wheel was turn'd; He saw his Verses damn'd, his Passion scorn'd. Then in a Rage th'ingrateful Town forsook, With many a Sigh, and many a parting Look, And to the Shades his mourning Muse convey'd, To weep his Fate, and curse the cruel Maid. Where now in unmolested Peace he reigns Th'unrival'd Prince of all the tuneful Swains, To him, and Pan they consecrate the Plains. No beauteous Virgin, that is us'd to wield The harmless Crook, and trace the dewy Field, But will for Theron weave a flow'ry Crown, And sighing wish the Shepherd were her own. No Swain so rude, but bows at Theron's Name, Proclaims his wondrous Worth, and sings his happy Fame. This Cycnus heard; whose Muse in Buskins sings The Fall of Empires, and the Fate of Kings: Or lashes, with a sharp Satyrick Rage, The Follies of a leud, degenerous Age. He heard, he saw, he read with wondring Eyes The happy Strains, and own'd a vast Surprize. So soft, so moving, yet so full of Fire; Made Envy's self his matchless Skill admire. Yet nought the unbelieving Bard cou'd move, To think such Verse the product of a Grove. Till urg'd with Envy of another's Fame, From noisy Streets, to silent Shades, he came; To see the Youth that sung such tender Lays, And try who best deserv'd a Crown of Bays, To tempt from Solitude the careful Swain, And with kind Tidings end his growing Pain. Tall Shadows now from distant Mountains fell, Each Swain his Cot, each Hermit sought his Cell: But Theron to a lonely Grove repairs, To mourn his Love, and sing away his Cares; There, every Night, when silence fill'd the Woods, And brooding Darkness o'er the Fields and Floods Had spread her sable Wings; the pensive Swain Wou'd sit, and weep, and of the Stars complain, And Celia, cruel Celia cry, in vain. But now the rising Moon with Silver Light, Began to paint the dusky Face of Night, And o'er the Meads her Lucid Beams advance, Where mimick Elves in antick Figures dance. When Cycnus list'ning travers'd o'er the Grove, And heard the Shepherd thus complain of Love. Ah cruel Moon! (the mournful Youth begun) To me unwelcome, as thy Brother Sun: On happier Lovers spread thy silent Beams, That kiss in Shades, or walk by warbling Streams. They may rejoice, and bless thee for thy Light, But let my Woes, and me be hid in Night: Darkness, Oblivion, everlasting Shades, Where no bright Glimpse the dreary Gloom invades! (If such a Place there be) that Place I crave, As dismal as my Thoughts, and silent as the Grave. Ah Celia, fair, unkind! Didst thou but know How full of Pain I live, how fraught with Woe; (If ought a Heart of Adamant can move) Thou need'st must pity, tho thou can'st not love. Here all the Night, about the Shades I rove, And all my Tale is Celia, Fate, and Love. Or else upon some rising Hillock lie, Sigh, languish, weep, and wish I could but die. Hills, Groves, and Woods are conscious of my Flame, And every Tree bears cruel Celia's Name. Poor Philomel sometimes affords Relief, And in a kind Condolance sooths my Grief: She's with my Cares so well acquainted grown; She sings my Wrongs and quite forgets her own. But all in vain: My Sorrows will not cease, Till Celia's Voice shall hush my Soul to peace; From her alone a Cure I must obtain, She gave the Wound, and must relieve the Pain. If not, I'm in Despair and Anguish lost, And soon shall be a wandring, weeping Ghost. Dear charming Tyrant, let my Tears prevail, (Nought can succeed, if these last Tears should fail.) Leave, leave the Town, and to these Shades repair; These Shades will yield a softer, sweeter Air. Here, free from Business in a calm Retreat, Delightful as the Muses sacred Seat, In charming Grots, green Fields, and shady Bowers, We'll sweetly pass the gay, the smiling Hours: Here, like the Mortals of the golden Age, Secure from Envy, Treach'ry, Lust, and Rage: How happy, more than happy! should we be, Would'st thou but come, and love, and live with me? But if at last your Pity you deny, And I (in spite of all my Tears) must die: Yet let poor Theron, e'er his Soul depart, Once more behold those Eyes which fir'd his Heart; Grant me once more to view thy charming Face, Snatch one dear Kiss, and steal a short Embrace. I'll not offend thee by too long a stay, But press my Love, my last soft Homage pay; For Charon waits to waft my sighing Soul away. This, and much more the pensive Shepherd sung, Till Grief o'erwhelm'd his Voice, and stopt his Tongue; And Cycnus now convinc'd, that Theron's Name Had well deserv'd the best, and noblest Fame; Gently advanc'd, and to the Shepherd came. Where thus he spoke, and seem'd to mourn his Fate: Ah happy Swain, wer't not for Celia's Hate! 'Tis strange, fond Youth, she can resist so long The powerful Charms of your inchanting Song; So well you sing, so well complain of Love, Your Verse might Passion in a Statue move, Calm a rude Tempest, still the raging Wind, Stop rapid Streams, or make a Monster kind: Sure she's no Woman, or in Desarts nurst, With blood of Panthers quench'd her Infant Thirst; Stupid and wild as they; the Savage Bowl Drown'd all the Softness of the human Soul; For were there but one Spark of Native Fire, Soft Theron's sighing Lays would fan Desire; Melt the coy Nymph, till she her Love confest, And breath'd her Passion on his Joyful Breast. But she who stands unmov'd at Theron's Charms, Must be unworthy of his blissful Arms. Let me advise, come leave the lonely Grove, And strive to cancel this unhappy Love. Not here in Shades indulge the darling Grief; Silence augments your Pain, not yields Relief. Return, return, and all your Cares forget, And former Pleasures with fresh Gust repeat. Our crouded Town more pleasant Objects yields, Than either Groves, or Streams, or Woods, or Fields. You may be happy there, you there may find Your Stars indulgent and a Mistress kind. And yielding Fame no more your Arms will shun, But give the Crown which you so justly won. Return, return, great William's Deeds rehearse, And sing his Battels in Immortal Verse. Tell, how the Seas he in loud Tempests crost; To save a Nation, which had else been lost: How he the Crown at last vouchsaf'd to take, Not for his own, but poor Britannia's sake. Secure of Conquest wheresoe'er he fought, Returning home, Triumphant Laurels brought! Sing how the Hero past the rapid Flood, Rose from the Waves, and look'd the Warrior God! With Joy the Billows such a Burden bore; Whilst sounding Fame, and Vict'ry flew before; Then how the Toils of War he could sustain, Smiling on Fear with a serene Disdain, And glad to hear the Trumpet's chearful Call, Still rush'd thro Danger, and despis'd it all. And how at last, a happy Peace restor'd, The joyful Hero sheath'd his willing Sword. Let his great Acts be your inspiring Theam, Nor longer here thus sooth a sickly Dream. Thus the presuming Bard to Theron spoke, And thus at last the Swain his Silence broke. Of Warriors let the skilful Stepney sing, And Prior's Muse her lofty Raptures bring To pay due Honours to a Godlike King. I doom'd to Sorrow, must in Sylvan Song, To list'ning Woods relate my cruel Wrong. By Passion made unfit for chearful Airs, My Thoughts are all subjected to my Cares: And sure no Place so proper as a Grove, For one that languishes in hopeless Love. The Town! Alas I know the Town too well; That fatal Place, where Noise and Tumult dwell. Can Virtue hope to find a Place of Rest, Where Vice in her Imperial Glories drest, Usurps the Throne, and is by all ador'd; The sordid Beggar, and the shining Lord? No, no; long since, with Indignation fir'd, From thence the Goddess to the Shades retir'd. The Bard reply'd: Tho Vice is powerful grown, Yet has not Virtue quite forsook the Town. To her the Generous still due Homage pay, And still the Goddess bears an equal Sway. Nor will she thence withdraw her brighter Charms; Whilst Collyer fights her Cause with conq'ring Arms; And charming Wesley, warm'd with pious Rage, On Virtue's Part so bravely does engage. 'Tis true, her Reign th'unthinking Vulgar hate, Yet still she's lov'd and honour'd by the Great; And H?t, and So?rs still support her State. Suppose litigious F? cannot rest, And Fury Law lies brooding in his Breast; Which, like the Devil Malice, drives him on To ruin others, till himself's undone. Suppose some Husbands here their Wives destroy, More fond of Riches than uxorious Joy; And others rise to Fortune and to Fame, Flying like Eagles at a nobler Game, Who Kings defraud, and publick Treas'rys cheat Nor fear a Punishment, because they're great: Yet sure with Virtue we may often meet, Each Man is not a D? nor a F?. Then why should one that sings like Theron, choose A Place like this to entertain his Muse? Can senseless Trees your wondrous Worth proclaim, Or whistling Winds sing your immortal Fame? Can you with Brutes and Savage Beasts converse, Or unbred Swains, that never heard a Verse Beyond a murder'd Psalm or ballad Air, Sung by vile Strolers at some Country Fair? Clowns, who from fruitful Dunghils take their Rise With equal Stamp of Ignorance and Vice, Whose highest Wisdom in their Senses lies, And all their Understanding in their Eyes. Soft (answer'd Theron) moderate your Rage, If for the Town with me you would engage. Sit down a while: I may some respite gain, These little Contests may divert my Pain. Be it your Business and your Task to tell What Vice, what Follies in the Country dwell; Whilst I a more ungrateful Subject choose, And to the Town compel m'unwilling Muse, Assume new Numbers, and a bolder Face, T'expose the Leudness of the hated Place. The Bard agreed, nor stay'd the Rivals long, E'er smiling Cycnus thus begun the Song. In vain you boast your Innocence so great; Imperious Vice keeps too her rural Seat: The sordid Swains, by Nature prone to Ill, Want more the Knowledg than they do the Will There are some Crimes peculiar to the Town, Not practis'd here, because they are unknown. But rustick Vices stam each blushing Day, And the dull Clown is leudest in his Way. Oft have I laugh'd to see the brainless Rout, With aukward dancing fling themselves about: Till down their Sunburnt Faces Sweat distil'd, And undistinguish'd Clamours fill the Field. D'ye ask the Cause? A Farmer's eldest Son, Hight Corydon, the envy'd Prize has won. In woful Rhymes the Victor's Praise they sing, On each of's Arms the buxome Lasses cling: Then round a Stand of Ale the Rusticks lie, And drink like Beasts the sounding Vessel dry. Then drunk, with Lust the mingling Sexes fill'd, Act their rank Leudness in the open Field. Each Town, each Village well may curse the Day That gave the Cause, and call'd them out to play; The dire Remembrance begs at every Door, A bawling Bastard, and a lazy Wh?re. Nor are these Boors alone by Vice subdu'd, Their Masters too are senseless, vain, and leud. Here in an old thatch'd House by Tempests torn, By all but him, and Owls, and Bats forlorn, There lives a Wight, run mad for love of Gold, (They call him Colon) wretched, rich, and old. No Spouse, no Off-spring ever grac'd his Bed; Too rough to Love, too covetous to Wed: No menial Servants round his Table wait, No croud of Beggars throng his silent Gate, Alas! the Wretch himself scarce dares to eat. Yet under ground the Churl vast Treasure keeps, And in his mouldy Chests the shining Idol sleeps; Got by Oppression, while the injur'd Poor Increase, and not partake his useless Store. Not far from hence a Princely Palace shrouds Its rising Head amongst the flying Clouds. Encompass'd round with a delightful Scene Of Rivers, Meads, and Groves for ever green; Where smiling Flora paints the gaudy Way, And in cool Waves the sportful Naiads play. Too happy Man! the Lord of such a Seat; Did Virtue join to make the Bliss compleat: But her he knows no more than to despise; So from her Arms by consequence he flies. Drink, Dogs, and Horses are his darling Joys, To this he gives his Nights, to these his Days. Lavish of Gold, and prodigal of Health, The careless Spendthrift idly wasts his Wealth. On him a Crew of wretched Rakes depend, That sooth his Follies, and his Faults commend: A Cadet one, old Cavaliers the rest, A drunken Lawyer, and a gaming Priest. With daily Food these Locusts he supplies, Who, in return, persuade the Fool is wise. These Theron, these disgrace your boasted Plain, These frequent Crimes in every Village reign. More I could mention, but let these suffice To shew the Country is not free from Vice. Happy the Youth! who far from pensive Groves Spends his glad Hours in Mirth, and various Loves; If one coy Nymph a wish'd Embrace denies, Another strait his vacant Arms supplies. What tho Papirius chast Sulpitia shuns, To meet his Flames Aurelia panting runs; Aurelia to her trading Spouse deny'd The Joys of Wedlock, and a blooming Bride; Papirius reaps the Harvest of her Charms, And lies intranc'd within her crushing Arms. Sergius the Brave, the Gallant, and the Gay, To whom a wedded Wife could yield no Joy; Luxurious thro the Female World does rove, By just Decree divorc'd from lawful Love. You need not here drag on the Load of Life, Clog'd with that Houshold Plague, a craving Wife. If flowing Blood provoke a strong Desire, Some generous Nymph will soon abate the Fire: Or if for Profit you're oblig'd to wed, A Doctor soon removes the Nusance of your Bed. You need not of your Thraldom long complain, Mirmil and Maurus ne'er took Fees in vain. Who's will may live in idle Shades for me, Sigh Love to Winds, and wound each harmless Tree; I'll in the Town a Life more sprightly pass, With generous Friends, and the reviving Glass. Pray what Diversions can the Country give, That, like the Stage, our careful Thoughts relieve? The height of Passion there we daily prove; Revenge, Hate, Pity, Jealousy, and Love: Our vacant Hours there glad Refreshment find, Which charms the Fancy, and informs the Mind. But can your Fields or Plains or Groves produce, Except your own, one soft, one tuneful Muse? Yes, your Amintas, he that wears the Bays, Can sing sweet Sonnet, and make Rounde-Lays; And G?d that writes Lampoons with hasty Rage, Still thinks it hard he cannot charm the Age: But while he labours on so base a Theam, None will admire, but all despise his Dream. The charming Philomela sings no more Her Lovers lost, and seeks a Foreign Shore. She was the Glory of the Groves and Plains, Pride of her Sex, and Joy of all the Swains. But now she's mute. The rest with tuneless Throats Like Screech-owls, hoot their harsh unpleasing Notes. Here ended Cycnus, and the blushing Swain Confest he'd too much Reason to complain: Yet in these Shades, quoth Theron, ne'er were known Such barbarous Mischiefs as infect the Town. Extravagance and Lust, Pride, Envy, Cheats, Murders, Oaths, Atheism too, her Guilt compleats; The very Streets will prove th'Assertion true, Vices of every kind appear in view; Rogues of all sorts, and Fools of every size, Some unobserv'd pass by, and some affront our Eyes. Here struts a Fop, with starch affected Grace; There reels a Sot, with Bacchus in his Face. This starves his Belly, that he may be fine; And that undos himself, and Friends, for Wine. Here, at the corner of a crouded Street, A brace of formal busy Coxcombs meet: Of Trade, and of Religion they discourse, But—Hypocrites are always Knaves of course. There, lolling in a Coach, Aureno lies, Whose numerous Train does all the Mob surprize, And gains their Voices, as it charms their Eyes. To these he bows as humble as a Slave, But treats with Insolence the Great and Brave: Thinks he is wrong'd, that of their own accord Th'uncivil City had not dubb'd him Lord. Lavish as Xerxes, and as Cræsus rich; Much every Day receives, and squanders much. Two Wh? by turns his vacant Hours employ; Whom, as the Gout permits, he does enjoy. Oft with sham Bounty he beguiles the People, Makes drunk the Mob, or else erects a Steeple. But let him, if he'd gain immortal Fame, Go build a Church, and give it D?s Name. Ah wretched Town! What Monsters dost thou breed? What ravenous Harpyes on thy Vitals feed? Pimps, Parasites, Buffoons, designing Knaves, Audacious Villains, humble cheating Slaves; Such as your Tradesmen are, who Truth disguise, And live by Tricking, Cheats, and formal Lies. All would be Great, and all would be Supreme, Gold is their God, and Profit all their Theme. Some by defrauding of their Neighbours thrive, Others by politick Projections live. On fickle Chance the Merchant's Hopes depend, And Impudence is still the Lawyer's Friend. How else could S?d such vast Treasures gain? And quibling S? has not baul'd in vain. In great gilt Coaches thro the Streets they ride, Big with Ambition, bloated up with Pride: Whilst others, that like Icarus will soar, Fall from their height, and live despis'd and poor. With borrow'd Coin the Banker ventures all, And at a push must either rise or fall: And should we e'er see Honesty prevail, Great-Lombard-street might languish in a Jail. The trading Quacks too bear an equal part, Paultry Pretenders to Apollo's Art; Certain as Fate th'unhappy Patients die, Whilst Ludlow durst prescribe, and Lee apply. Leudness pollutes Religion's living Streams, And drunken Ho?nd in the Pulpit dreams. The other Party too has suffer'd long Th'Impertinence of noisy tatling Y?ng; The hot-brain'd Fool a Madhouse once restrain'd, And sickning Bedlam of his Tongue complain'd. But hold, my Muse, a while suspend thy Rage, And tell what Worth adorns the thankless Age: Dorset and Hallifax, a matchless Pair, Have reach'd her Sight, and challeng'd all her Care: Dorset and Hallifax, brave, just, and good, Noble in Virtue as they are in Blood; Great William's Friends, our Isle's Support and Stay, The Poets Patrons, and the Muses Joy; Triumphant stand amidst the sacred Throng Of learned Bards, whose emulative Song In lofty Numbers, and ne'er-dying Verse, Th'immortal Hero's matchless Praise rehearse. First generous Pryor greets the rising Age, A mighty Genius shines thro every Page: His Theam, and Verse still vast, are still the same, And as his Muse descends mounts upwards too in Flame. Whilst by his Fav'rite great Apollo stands, Striking the speaking Strings with artful Hands: Wondring we hear a second Pindar sing, Extol the Poet's Art, adore the God-like King. Dryden, 'tis true, the mournful Tomb enfolds, A narrow Grave the mighty Poet holds! Yet shall his Verse to future Age remain, And Worlds to come applaud his heavenly Strain. Whilst Garth and Congreve, Heirs to all the Flame With which he wrote, and rose to endless Fame, Charm with soft Harmony the list'ning Age, Or lash its Vices with a noble Rage. Judicious Dennis too, with equal Fire, Shines sweetly bright, and never shall expire. Poor Iphigenia weeps in such a Strain; We read, we pity, and we feel her Pain. Southerne still moves our Soul with tender Grief; (A fatal Marriage, and a double Wife!) None but a Savage could refrain from Tears, When he the innocent Adultress hears. Amongst the Worthies of the Female Quire, Clarinda blazes with immortal Fire. With genial Heat the Delian God has fir'd Her tender Breast, and now she sings inspir'd: Soft rural Lays the tuneful Charmer try'd, Her Numbers like a Silver Current glide. Not Behn her self with all her softest Art So well could talk of Love, or touch the Heart. To all the rest that wear the sacred Bays, Unknown, my Muse a silent Homage pays. But see what Croud is that which lags behind? With meager Looks; a spurious, mungril kind! In vain they stretch their stubble Wings, and try, Like those before, to mount thro Air and Sky. In vain they catch at Fame; their Touch she scorns, And to their native Earth the grov'ling Rhymers spurns. Brown their chief Leader, whom the Mob adore, A pigmy Poet, scandalous, and poor. Pettis to him succeeds, and trifling VVard, A frolick Writer, and a Smithfield Bard. Next Settle shews, amidst the rhyming Throng, Unhappy Poet to have liv'd so long! A Play-wright once; for Profit and for Praise He drudg'd: But vanish'd are those golden Days. Expel'd the Stage, he met unhappy Times; And now for Bread composes Bellman's Rhymes. Motteux, and Durfey are for nothing fit, But to supply with Songs their want of Wit. Had not the Island Princess been adorn'd With Tunes, and pompous Scenes, she had been scorn'd. What was not Fletcher's, no more Sense contains, Than he that wrote the Jubilee, has Brains; Which ne'er had pleas'd the Town, or purchas'd Fame, But that 'twas christ'ned with a modish Name. More I could urge in scandal to the Town, And tell of Crimes to harmless Shades unknown: How Fathers burn with execrable Fires, And Daughters mingle with their lustful Sires; How R?by scorns the Ladies charming Eyes, And on Male-Love his leud Embraces tries. Some City Matrons too might well prolong Th'ungrateful Task of my Satyrick Song, Who burn with Liquors, Envy, Lust, and Pride; Nor e'er their craving Appetites deny'd: Regard the true Concerns of Life no more Than the dull Spouse with Bottle and a Whore. But stop my Muse, for it must be confest, No Sins like those which do the Town infest: By seeing part, we may suppose the rest. Then on and tell what Bliss the Swains enjoy, Before shrill Chanticleer has wak'd the Day. With softer Voice in rural numbers sing The budding Glories of the Infant Spring. When teeming Nature with a gradual Birth Brings forth her various Greens, and garnishes the Earth With blooming Flowers, from whose fragrant Leaves The painful Bees inrich their useful Hives, And the gay Butterfly her Pride receives. Next by her Liberality bestow'd The Mountain Rasps, and Strawb'ries of the Wood; The nobler Fruits, loading the spreading Trees, Whose splendid Looks the joyful Gazer please, Which show like Gold and Corals nicely plac'd, And like Ambrosia to the thankful Tast. At last the rich luxuriant purple Vine Boasts her inspiring Clusters more Divine; Each Place adorn'd with fresh inviting Groves, For cool Retreats, or solitary Loves. While Phœbus chearful Beams, with healthful Air, Makes a gay glad Elizium every where. Happy the Man, who acts his Part of Life In this blest Scene, remote from Noise and Strife. Content and Ease, with all their peaceful Train, Wait every Hour, and bless the humble Swain. No golden Wish invades his homely Seat, To vex his Thoughts with Hopes of being great. No frightful Dreams his starting Soul surprize, Or make him wish the Day with waking Eyes. No Globes, or gilded Spires his Gates adorn; No Silk, or Purple's by the Shepherd worn; Him, and his Love, a little Cottage holds, And Cloth of Wool their healthy Limbs enfolds. On Beds of Moss they sleep secure and sound; With gentle Dreams, and golden Slumbers crown'd. Or if loud Winds the neighbouring Forests shake, Or Winter Storms the sleeping Lovers wake; They listen to the Tempest with Delight, Secure from all the Terrors of the Night. Oh! let me ever live in silent Shades, Remote from noisy Towns, and busy Trades; Where I may innocently pass my Days In virtuous Pleasure and in harmless Joys, With some young Virgin Vot'ress of the Grove; Like Celia fair, but faithful as a Dove. Ah! could I once forget that fatal Name, Teach my fond Breast to own another Flame, Till the fresh Rapture had eras'd her Charms, And a new Nymph came welcome to my Arms: Then to the Groves in sprightly Tunes I'd sing; The Vales should with redoubled Io's ring. The gay Idea fills my glowing Breast With fancy'd Joys too vast to be exprest. How sweet the Pleasure! when the Evening Breeze With gentle Murmurs fans the waving Trees, To walk along the River's verdant side, And listen to the soft complaining Tide: Or in some winding Valley to behold Our weary Flocks run bleating to their Fold! Whilst on my rural Pipe I softly play A mournful Requiem to the falling Day: And the kind Nymph upon my Labour smiles, Rewarding with a Kiss her Shepherd's Toils. Raptur'd I think, how, when the Shades are fled, And bright Aurora leaps from Tithon's Bed, E'er Phœbus can relieve the bending Grass, My Love and I the flowry Fields might trace, To hear the Warblings of the winged Choir, And tast the fragrant Sweets of morning Air; Crop Virgin Violets blushing from their Bed, And sip the pearly Dew on Leaves of Roses shed. Then, then I curse, and ban the baleful Dart, That in so ill an Hour transfix'd my Heart. 'Tis then I call the cruel Maid in vain, To quit the Town, and hasten to the Plain. With Rapture Cycnus heard the Shepherd tell What charming Pleasures in the Country dwell, Nor longer could the joyful News conceal: Then thus the happy Secret did reveal. Prepare dear tuneful Youth, prepare to hear A Tale so kind 'twill charm your ravish'd Ear; Celia the false, the faithless, and the fair, Fickle as Chance, and fleeting as the Air, For whom you left the Town, and sought the Groves, Spite of her Pride at length has own'd she loves. The smother'd Fire is kindled into Flame, There's nothing now so dear as Theron's Name. To morrow she resigns up all her Charms, With Joy she runs, she flies into your wish'd-for Arms. As, when the Sun's too powerful Beams invade The tender Lillies, in their native Shade; With languid Looks, the mourning Flowers decay, Scorch'd with the Ardor of a burning Day: But when kind Auster on his humid Wings Some gentle Showers of soft Refreshment brings, And on their Leaves the dewy Cordial sheds, Soon they revive, and raise their pensive Heads, Regain their fragrant smell, their Charms retrieve, And in their former Pride and Splendor live. So Theron far'd, who but few Moments past Droop'd in Despair, and wish'd to breathe his last: Now fill'd with Joy, starts sudden from the Ground, And thus taught Eccho a more chearful Sound. She loves! Farewel ye melancholy Woods, Farewel ye silver Streams, and chrystal Floods: To whom I've often sigh'd my Griefs in vain, No more, no more, you'll hear me now complain. She loves! No longer I'll converse with you, Hills, Groves, and Woods, and Solitude adieu. Charm'd to the Town again by Celia's Call, Whose Love, whose Virtue can atone for all. Come, come my Godlike Friend, with winged Feet, We'll run, and the consenting Goddess meet. Stay not to talk; look there, the rising Day Already breaks, and summons us away. He spoke, and thro the dewy Shades they prest, And Phœbus rose, and smil'd to see the Lover blest. A Pindarick Ode, occasioned by the Death of the late Lord Chief Justice Treby, 1701. I. As Indians, when a valu'd Hero dies, Prepare no cheap, no common Obsequies, But costly Piles the high-priz'd Body burn; With Gums they load the odoriferous Urn, And Fumes of Spices waft him to the Skies: So we presume not to attend thy Death With common or unhallow'd Breath; But— With Voice of Anthems and of Airs Divine We 'dorn thy Hearse and consecrate thy Shrine. Nobler than Incense or aspiring Flame, Such as for Gods Poetick Fancies frame. II. VVhy did we not with fervent Raptures pray, And importune the Heavens for his stay? Alas! if Prayers could have brib'd the Skies, So moving were his own, his own cou'd well suffice: But Heaven's now our Rival grown, And robs us of our Joys t'increase its own: Or else the weight of State and Care Was much too heavy for a Saint to bear: Or with the Joys above divinely fir'd, Thinking it goodly to be there, He thought he saw, and he expir'd. When Heaven so much Pains had shewn To stamp the Favorite for her own, Why was it slow to save So fine a Purchase from the Grave? But this is sacred and behind the Vale, Whiles we in piteous Mourning left, Of all but Sighs and Murmurings bereft, Grow wild with Providence, and rail That so much Worth should be Subject alike to common Destiny. III. Joy of it self bespeaks a wondrous Grace, When its gay Spirits spread and wanton in the Face: But Grief and sullen Woe Benumb the Spirits that would in Numbers flow; The Soul then bends beneath its Care, As if 'twere ty'd to Sorrow and Despair: To praise him right her strains should be As far above the Clouds as he. Who can the Loss relentless hear, When even Malice has allow'd a Tear? If Envy's silent and is piteous grown, In what sad shape must Love and Duty moan? And tho in silence they lament, Yet Truth is ever Eloquent; The deepest Sighs may burst, and Tears may dry, And like or Time or Chance may raise The fairest Characters of Praise: But hearty Sorrow scarce can die, And is as lasting as his Monument. IV. Some grow illustrious thro a prosperous state; But Treby's Sufferings help'd to make him great, For wounded Vertue shines with brightest Light, As Diamonds till cut are never bright. Firm and unmov'd he did like Isthmus stand, Still beating back the Waves that beat upon the Land. When Rome laid out a Picture justly Great, The Hero's painted strugling with his Fate; As if those various Trials were design'd, There where they cou'd not shock, to raise the Mind: So in those Pieces that are finely made, We find the Beauty heightn'd by the Shade. The Indians torture all the Royal Race, And he that suffers best obtains the Place; None to the Helm of Government can come, Unless by Crosses ripen'd for a Throne. Brave Souls, like Aristotle's Stars, Backt with their Deities above, Have each a Genius to controul The wild Excentricks of the Soul; And tho the Space wherein they move Be great, it's regular: Treby could not move Beyond the Bounds of Justice and of State; His Action's still heroically great, Because his Center was above. V. Let single Vertues meaner Souls adorn, But Treby equally with all was born. As the fam'd Roman Pantheon did enshrine Within it self whatever was Divine; Great without Pride, and without Wrinkles wise, Obliging without Art, and just without Disguise, Wise in his Counsels, humble in Discourse, Good without Noise, and pleasant without Force, Easy of Access, willing to bestow, Regarded Vertue and forgot his Foe; So much his Goodness with the Law did strive, What Justice would have punish'd Mercy did forgive. So full of Knowledg here below, He only could receive addition now. And thy great new-flown Soul so swift, These Realms of Frailty when departing left, That as the method is of Angels here, You only seem to disappear; And since like them you have your Character, And of Perfections as great a share, Not only faultless; but good to that excess, You'l scarce admit a change when you'r refin'd for Bliss. The Triumph of Peace. A Poem, 1698. To Sir Richard Blackmore, Kt. M. D. Fellow of the College of Physicians in London, and Physician in Ordinary to his Majesty. Hear, Britain, hear a rough unpractis'd Tongue! Tho rough my Voice, the Muse inspires the Song; The Heav'n-born Muse; ev'n now she springs her Flight, And bears my raptur'd Soul thro untrac'd Realms of Light. We mount aloft, and in our airy Way Retiring Kingdoms far beneath survey. Amid the rest a spacious Tract appears, Obscure in view, and on its Visage wears Black hov'ring Mists, which thick'ning by degrees; Extend a louring Storm o'er Earth and Seas. But, lo! an Eastern Light arising high, Drives the tempestuous Wrack along the Sky! Then thus the Muse—Look down, my Son! and see The bright Procession of a Deity! She spoke; the darkning Gloom was vanisht quite, And well-known Europe stands disclos'd to Sight. Of various States the various Bounds appear; There wide Hispania, fruitful Gallia here; Belgia's low Soil conspicuous from afar, And Flandria, long the Field of a destructive War. Germania too, with cluster'd Vines o'erspread; And lovely Albion from her watry Bed, Beauteous above the rest, rears her auspicious Head. Sea-Nymphs beneath her chalky Cliffs resort, And awful Neptune keeps his reedy Court; His Darling Thames, rich Presents in his Hand Of bounteous Ceres, traverses the Land; And seems a mighty Snake, whose shining Pride Does thro the Meads in sinuous Volumes glide. Ah, charming Isle! fairest of all the Main! Too long thou dost my willing Eye detain. For see a Hero on the adverse Strand! And, lo! a blooming Virgin in his Hand! All hail, Cœlestial Pair!—a Goddess she Of Heav'nly Birth confest, a more than Mortal He! Victorious Laurels on his Brows he wears; Th'attending Fair a branching Olive bears. Slender her Shape, in Silver Bands confin'd; Her snowy Garments loosely flow behind, Rich with embroider'd Stars, and ruffle in the Wind. But once such differing Beauty met before, When Warriour Mars did Love's bright Queen adore Ev'n Love's bright Queen might seem less winning fair, And Mars submit to his Heroick Air. Not Jove himself, Imperial Jove can show A nobler Mien, or more undaunted Brow, When his strong Arm through Heav'ns Ætherial Plains Compels the kindl'd Bolt, and awful Rule maintains. And now embark'd they seek the British Isles, Pleas'd with the Charge propitious Ocean smiles. Before, old Neptune smooths the liquid way; Obsequious Tritons on the surface play; And sportful Dolphins with a nimble Glance, To the bright Sun their glist'ring Scales advance. In oozy Beds profound the Billows sleep, No clamorous Winds awake the silent Deep; Rebuk'd, they whisper in a gentle Breeze, And all around is Universal Peace. Proceed, my Muse! The following Pomp declare; Say who, and what the bright Attendants were! First Ceres in her Chariot seated high, By harness'd Dragons drawn along the Sky; A Cornucopia fill'd her weaker Hand, Charg'd with the various Off-spring of the Land, Fruit, Flowers, and Corn; her right a Sickle bore; A yellow Wreath of twisted Wheat she wore. Next Father Bacchus with his Tygers grac'd The Show, and squeezing Clusters as he pass'd, Quaff'd flowing Goblets of rich flavour'd Wine. In order last succeed the tuneful Nine; Apollo too was there; behind him hung His useless Quiver, and his Bow unstrung; He touch'd his Golden Lyre, and thus he sung. Lead on, bright WILLIAM! In thy happy Reign Peace and the Muses are restor'd again. War, that fierce Lyon, long disdaining Law, Rang'd uncontroul'd, and kept the World in aw, And trembling Kingdoms crouch'd beneath his Paw. At last the reeling Monster, drunk with Gore, Falls at thy Feet subdu'd, and quells his Roar; Tamely to Thee he bends his shaggy Mane, And on his Neck admits the long-rejected Chain. At thy protecting Court for this blest Day, Attending Nations their glad Thanks shall pay: Not Belgia, and the rescu'd Isle alone, But Europe shall her great Deliverer own: Rome's mighty Grandeur was not more confest, When great Antonius travel'd thro the East, And Crouds of Monarchs did each Morning wait meet; With early Homage at his Palace-Gate. Hast then, bright Prince! thy Britain's Transports Hast to her Arms, and make her Bliss compleat! What e'er glad News has reach'd her listning Ear, While her long absent Lord provokes her Fear, Her Joys are in suspence, her Pleasures unsincere. He comes, thy Hero comes! O beauteous Isle! Revive thy Genius with a chearful Smile! Let thy rejoicing Sons fresh Palms prepare, To grace the Trophies of the finish'd War; On high be hung the Martial Sword insheath'd, The Shield with Ribbons dress'd, and Spear with Ivy wreath'd! Let speaking Paint in various Tablets show Past Scenes of Battel to the Croud below! Round this Triumphant Pile in rustick Dance The shouting Swains shall hand in hand advance; The wealthy Farmer from his Toils shall cease; The Ploughman from the Yoke his smoaking Steers release, And join to solemnize the Festival of Peace. No more for want of Hands th'unlabour'd Field, Choak'd with rank Weeds, a sickly Crop shall yield: Calm Peace returns; behold her shining Train! And fruitful Plenty is restor'd again.— Apollo ceas'd;—The Muses take the Sound, From Voice to Voice th'harmonious Notes rebound, And ecchoing Lyres transmit the volant Fugue around. Mean while the steddy Bark with prosp'rous Gales Fills the large Sheets of her expanded Sails, And gains th'intended Port; thick on the Strand, Like swarming Bees, th'assembl'd Britons stand, And press to see their welcome Sov'reign land: At his Approach unruly Transport reigns In ev'ry Breast, and Rapture fires their Veins. A general Shout succeeds, as when on high Exploded Thunder rends the vaulted Sky. A short Convulsion shakes the solid Shore, And rocks th'adjacent Deep, unmov'd before; Loud Acclamations thro the Valleys ring, While to Augusta's Walls the Croud attend their King. And now behold The Quire of St. Paul's first open'd on the Day of Thanksgiving for the Peace. a finish'd Temple rise, On lofty Pillars climbing to the Skies! Of Bulk stupendous its proud Pile it rears, The gradual Product of successive Years. An inner Gate that folds with Iron Leaves, The charm'd Spectator's entring Steps receives: Where curious Works in twisted Stems are seen Of branching Foliage vacuous between. O'er this a vocal Organ mounted high On Marble Columns, strikes the wondring Eye, And feeds at once two Senses with Delight, Sweet to the Ear, and splendid to the Sight. Marble the Floor, enrich'd with native Stains Of various Dye, and streak'd with azure Veins. Ev'n emulous Art with Nature seems to strive, And the carv'd Figures almost breathe and live; The painted Altar, glorious to behold, Shines with delightful Blue, and dazling Gold. Here first th'illustrious Three of Heav'nly Race, Religion, Liberty, and Peace embrace; Here joyful Crouds their pious Thanks express For Peace restor'd, and Heav'ns Indulgence bless. Auspicious Structure! Born in happy Days, Whose first Employment is the Noblest, PRAISE! So when by just degrees, th'Eternal THOUGHT His Six-Days Labour to Perfection brought, With Laws of Motion first endu'd the Whole, And bad the Heav'ns in destin'd Circles roll: Then polish'd Spheres commenc'd their Harmony; All Nature in a Chorus did agree, And the World's Birth-Day was a Jubilee. To my Lord Chancellor Hyde. Presented on New-Years-Day, 1662. By J. DRYDEN. My Lord, While flattering Crouds officiously appear To give themselves, not you, an happy Year; And by the greatness of their Presents prove How much they hope, but not how well they love; The Muses (who your early Courtship boast, Tho now your Flames are with their Beauty lost) Yet watch their time, that if you have forgot They were your Mistresses, the World may not: Decay'd by Time and Wars, they only prove Their former Beauty by your former Love; And now present, as antient Ladies do, That courted long at length are forc'd to woo. For still they look on you with such kind Eyes, As those that see the Churches Sovereign rise, From their own Order chose, in whose high State They think themselves the second Choice of Fate, When our Great Monarch into Exile went, Wit and Religion suffer'd Banishment: Thus once when Troy was wrapt in Fire and Smoak, The helpless Gods their burning Shrines forsook; They with the vanquisht Prince and Party go, And leave their Temples empty to the Foe: At length the Muses stand restor'd again To that great Charge which Nature did ordain; And their lov'd Druids seem reviv'd by Fate, While you dispense the Laws and guide the State. The Nation's Soul (our Monarch) does dispense Through you to us his vital Influence; You are the Channel where those Spirits flow, And work them higher as to us they go. In open Prospect nothing bounds our Eye, Until the Earth seems joyn'd unto the Sky: So in this Hemisphere our utmost view Is only bounded by our King and you: Our sight is limited where you are join'd, And beyond that no farther Heav'n can find. So well your Vertues do with his agree, That tho your Orbs of different greatness be, Yet both are for each other's use dispos'd, His to inclose, and yours to be inclos'd. Nor could another in your room have been, Except an Emptiness had come between. Well may he then to you his Cares impart, And share his Burden where he shares his Heart. In you his Sleep still wakes; his Pleasures find Their Share of Bus'ness in your lab'ring Mind: So when the weary Sun his Place resigns, He leaves his Light and by Reflection shines. Justice that sits and frowns, where publick Laws Exclude soft Mercy from a private Cause, In your Tribunal most her self does please; There only smiles because she lives at ease; And like young David finds her Strength the more, When disincumber'd from those Arms she wore: Heav'n would your Royal Master should exceed Most in that Vertue which we most did need; And his mild Father (who too late did find All Mercy vain, but what with Pow'r was join'd) His fatal Goodness left to fitter times, Not to increase but to absolve our Crimes. But when the Heir of this vast Treasure knew How large a Legacy was left to you, (Too great for any Subject to retain) He wisely ty'd it to the Crown again: Yet passing through your Hands it gathers more, As Streams through Mines bear Tincture of their Ore. While Emp'rick Politicians use deceit, Hide what they give, and cure but by a cheat; You boldly shew that Skill which they pretend, And work by Means as noble as your End: Which, should you veil, we might unwind the Clue, As Men do Nature, till we came to you. And as the Indies were not found before Those rich Perfumes which from the happy Shore The Winds upon their balmy Wings convey'd, Whose guilty Sweetness first their World betray'd; So by your Counsels we are brought to view A rich and undiscover'd World in you. By you our Monarch does that Fame assure, Which Kings must have or cannot live secure: For prosp'rous Princes gain the Subjects Heart, Who love that Praise in which themselves have part: By you he fits those Subjects to obey, As Heaven's Eternal Monarch does convey His Pow'r unseen, and Man to his Designs, By his bright Ministers the Stars, inclines. Our setting Sun from his declining Seat Shot Beams of Kindness on you, not of Heat: And when his Love was bounded in a few, That were unhappy that they might be true; Made you the Fav'rite of his last sad times, That is a Suff'rer in his Subjects Crimes: Thus those first Favours you receiv'd were sent, Like Heaven's Rewards, in Earthly Punishment. Yet Fortune, conscious of your Destiny, Ev'n then took care to lay you softly by: And wrapt your fate among her precious things, Kept fresh to be unfolded with your King's. Shown all at once you dazl'd so our Eyes, As new-born Pallas did the Gods surprise; When springing forth from Jove's new-closing Wound, She struck the Warlike Spear into the Ground; Which sprouting Leaves did suddenly inclose, And peaceful Olives shaded as they rose. How strangely active are the Arts of Peace, Whose restless Motions less than Wars do cease! Peace is not freed from Labour but from Noise; And War more Force but not more Pains employs. Such is the mighty Swiftness of your Mind, That (like the Earth's) it leaves our Sense behind; While you so smoothly turn and roll our Sphear, That rapid Motion does but Rest appear. For as in Nature's Swiftness, with the Throng Of flying Orbs while ours is born along, All seems at rest to the deluded Eye (Mov'd by the Soul of the same Harmony) So carry'd on by your unwearied Care, We rest in Peace and yet in Motion share. Let Envy then those Crimes within you see, From which the Happy never must be free; (Envy that does with Misery reside, The Joy and the Revenge of ruin'd Pride) Think it not hard if at so cheap a rate You can secure the constancy of Fate, Whose Kindness sent, what does their Malice seem, By lesser Ills the greater to redeem? Nor can we this weak Show'r a Tempest call, But Drops of Heat that in the Sun-shine fall. You have already weary'd Fortune so, She cannot farther be your Friend or Foe; But sits all breathless, and admires to feel A Fate so weighty that it stops her Wheel. In all things else above our humble Fate, Your equal Mind yet swells not into State, But like some Mountain in those happy Isles, Where in perpetual Spring young Nature smiles, Your Greatness shows: no Horrour to afright, But Trees for shade, and Flow'rs to court the sight; Sometimes the Hill submits it self a while In small Descents, which do its height beguile; And sometimes mounts, but so as Billows play, Whose rise not hinders but makes short our way. Your Brow, which does no fear of Thunder know, Sees rolling Tempests vainly beat below; And (like Olympus Top) th'impression wears Of Love and Friendship writ in former Years. Yet unimpair'd with Labours or with Time, Your Age but seems to a new Youth to climb. Thus Heav'nly Bodys do our time beget; And measure Change, but share no part of it. And still it shall without a weight increase, Like this New-Year, whose Motions never cease. For since the glorious Course you have begun Is led by CHARLES, as that is by the Sun, It must both Weightless and Immortal prove, Because the Center of it is above. Upon the stately Structure of Bow-Church and Steeple, Burnt Ann. 1666. Rebuilt 1679. By Dr. WILD. Look how the Country-Hobbs with wonder flock To see the City-Crest turn'd Weathercock! Which with each shifting Gale, veers to and fro; London has now got twelve Strings to her Bow! The Wind's South-East, &amp; straight the Dragon russels His brazen Wings, to court the Breeze from Brussels! The Wind's at North! and now his Hissing Fork Whirls round, to meet a flattering Gale from York! Boxing the Compass with each freshing Gale, But still to London turns his threatning Tail. But stay! what's there? I spy a stranger thing; Our Red-cross brooded by the Dragon's Wing! The Wing is warm; but O beware the Sting! Poor English-Cross, expos'd to Winds and Weathers, Forc't to seek shelter in the Dragon's Feathers! Ne'er had old Rome so rare a Piece to brag on, A Temple built to Great Bell and the Dragon! Whilst yet undaunted Protestants dare hope, They that will worship Bell, shall wear the Rope. O how our English Chronicles will shine! Burnt sixty six, Rebuilt in seventy nine. When Jacob Hall on his High Rope shews Tricks, The Dragon flutters; the Lord Mayor's Horse kicks: The Cheapside-Crouds, and Pageants, scarcely know Which most t'admire, Hall, Hobby-Horse, or Bow! But what mad Frenzy set your Zeal on fire, (Grave Citizens!) to raise Immortal Spire On Sea-coal Basis? which will sooner yield Matter to burn a Temple, than to build! What the Coals build, the Ashes bury: no Men Of Wisdom, but would dread the threatning Omen! But say (Proud Dragon!) now prefer'd so high, What Marvels from that Prospect dost thou spy? Westward thou seest, and seeing hat'st the Walls Of sometimes Rev'rend, now Regenerate Pauls. Thy envious Eyes such Glories cannot brook, But as the Devil once o'er Lincoln, look: And Envy's Poison will thy Bowels tear, Sooner than Daniel's Dose of Pitch and Hair. Then Eastward, to avoid that wounding sight, Thy glaring Eyes upon the Mum-glass light. Adorn'd with monstrous Forms to clear the scope, How much thou art out-dragon'd by the Pope. Ah Fools! to dress a Monument of Wo In whistling Silks, that should in Sackcloth go! Nay strangely wise our Senators appear To build That, and a Bedlam in a Year, That if the Mum-glass crack, they may inherit An Hospital becoming their great Merit! To Royal Westminster next turn thine Eye; Perhaps a Parliament thou mayst espy. Dragons of old gave Oracles at Rome; Then prophesy their Day, their Date, and Doom! And if thy visual Ray can reach the Main; Tell's when the Duke, new gone, returns again! Facing about, next view our Guildhall well, Where Reverend Fox-furs charm'd by potent spell Of Elephants (turn'd wrong side outward) dare Applaud the Plays, and yet hiss out the Player: Player! whose wise Zeal for City, Country, King, Shall to all Points of the wide Compass ring, Whilst Bow has Bells, or Royal Thames a Spring! Thy roving Eye perhaps from Hague may send's How the New League has made old Foes new Friends: But let substantial Witness Credence give it, Or ne'er believe me, if the House believe it! If true, I fear too late! France at one sup (Like Pearls dissolv'd in Cleopatra's Cup) Trade, Empire, Netherlands has swallow'd up! But hark! the Dragon speaks from brazen Mouth, Whose Words, tho Wind, are spoken in good South! To you of ratling Fame, and great Esteem; The higher plac'd, the less you ought to seem! To you of noble Souls, and gallant Minds, Learn to out-face (with me) the huffing Winds! To tim'rous feeble Spirits, that live beneath; Learn not of me to turn with every Breath! To those who (like Camelions) live on Air; Popular Praise is thin consumptive Fare! To you who Steeple upon Steeple set, Cut my Cocks-comb, if e'er to Heaven you get. A Paradox against Liberty. Written by the Lords, during their Imprisonment in the Tower, 1679. A prison, or an Isle, are much the same; They only differ in Conceit and Name. As Art the first, Nature immures the last; Only i'th' larger Mold her Figure's cast. All Islanders are in a Prison pent, And none at large, not those o'th' Continent. Each Mariner's a Prisoner in his Bark, The living World was prison'd in the Ark. And tho it be abroad adays, the Light Still lodges in the Prison of black Night. The Sea it self is to its Bounds confin'd, And Æolus in Caves shuts up the Wind. Nothing in Nature has such vast Extent, But is imprison'd in its Element. The Fish in watry Dungeons are inclos'd; Men, Beasts and Birds, to Earth and Air dispos'd. If to enlarge their narrow Bounds they strive, The fatal Freedom rarely they survive. And as with them, we hope with us 'twill be, When from their Prisons took, Death sets them free. Man can no more a native Freedom boast; That Jewel ne'er was found since first 'twas lost, 'Twas then transported to the Stygian Coast. But still there's something which we do esteem, Only because 'tis like the polisht Gem, And this we Freedom call; its Credit grows From a false Stamp, the gilded outside shows: Which avaritious Men attempt to get, Cheated and ruin'd with the Counterfeit. Like Children, Soapy-bubbles they pursue, And the fantastick Vision take for true; But whilst they think bright Forms they do embrace, Ixion-like, they find a Cloud i'th' place. Consent of Crouds exceeding Credit brings, And seems to stamp Truth's Image on false things; Not what's a real Good, but what does seem, Still shares the blind and popular Esteem. Whilst Sense and Fancy over-rule their Choice, And Reason in th'Election has no Voice. But Souls in vain have Reason's Attribute, If to their Rule they cannot Sense submit. Hence the Heroick Mind makes no complaint, But Freedom does enjoy, e'en in Restraint. When Chains and Fetters do his Body bind, He then appears more free, and less confin'd. Discord and Care, which do distract him here, In Durance take their leave, and come not there. False Friends and Flatterers then take last adieu, Who often swore how faithful and how true, Things their dishonest Bosoms never knew. These, like the Swallows, in cold Weather fly; A Summer's Fortune only draws them nigh. Flatt'rers a sort of fatal Suckers be, Which draw the Sap till they destroy the Tree. Fair Virtue to their Opticks when they bring, Seems a deform'd and antiquated thing. Vice they commend, whilst Virtue is despis'd; The Blackest by these Negroes most are pris'd. These Slaves to Vice do hug so hard and long, Till like the o'er-fond Ape they kill their Young. Ambition in the Mind's a feverish Thirst, Which is by drinking drier than at first; And these will feed the Humor till it burst. When Parasites the Arbiters are made, They'l place the Garland on a Bedlam's Head. Riot, Excess, and Pleasure car' the Day, And Lust (the worst of Tyrants) bears the sway, At whose black Throne they blind Allegiance pay. Morose and dull they do account the Grave; And the meek Man, fit only for a Slave: The Humble, of a Nature poor and base; The Chast, sprung from a dull insipid Race; And Temperance a Gallant's chief Disgrace. In Virtue's Garb the great Man's Vice they dress, Giving it Names which sound of Worthiness. They call his Pride the Grandeur of his Mind, And for his Lust the Name they have design'd Is a complaisant Air, that makes Men kind. Profaneness is his Wit; and his Excess By a gay janty Humour they express; All his Debauches too must be no less. Thus they lap Ruin up, and gild our Crimes; But Vice destroys like Ivy, where it climbs. In us, the dang'rous State th'Ambitious see Of Greatness, Avarice, and Flattery. Gifts, Honors, Office, Greatness, Grace of Kings, Raise the Ambitious upon Treach'rous Wings; Till from the mighty heights they giddy grow, And fall into the Ruin lies below. If the first fail, which do support our State, The last our Fall serve to precipitate. This with too dear Experience we have bought, And learnt a Lesson, which too late was taught. Prosperity's a Drug, that must be ta'en Corrected (Opium like) or else 'tis bane: A more Lethargick Quality's in her, Than ever yet in Opium did appear. Her fatal Poison to the Mind she sends; And uncorrect, in sure Destruction ends; Whilst in the way her gilded snares she lays, Easy and credulous Man she soon betrays; Who sees her Roses and her Lillies here, But her concealed Snakes doth never fear. Prosperity's Repasts puff up the Mind With unsubstantial and unwholesom Wind. 'Tis a Hault-Goust which Epicures do use, And choicer Viands squeamishly refuse. But when Affliction moulds your daily Bread, 'Tis then the staff of Life with which she's fed. Affliction (like the River Nile) bestows Her fruitful Blessings wheresoe'er she flows: And if when she withdraws, strange Serpents rise, Not in her Streams, but in the Soil it lies. Which (like the great Apollo) she strikes dead, By the same Influence they first were bred, If she return, and shew her hidden head. Great Minds (like the victorious Palms) are wont Under the Weights of Fortune more to mount. Strongly suppress'd, and hurl'd upon the ground, Fill'd with sublimer Thoughts they more rebound; Still careless whether Fortune smile or frown, Whether she give or take away a Crown. Our Walls are tided, and by that we know She always ebbs when she doth leave to flow, And constant in Inconstancy does grow. Make an attack all Injuries that can, They fall like Waves beneath a Rising Swan. Freed and secur'd from all discordant Care, Here we our Heads above the Billows bear, Till from our Shoulders they transplanted are. And from their summits, with dumb Gapes proclaim, Of a Quincumvirat the trait'rous shame. But during all this Storm, we still do find An Anchor and a Haven in our Mind, Not beaten now, tho then expos'd to th'Wind. As Nightingals, our Bosoms we expose, And sing, environ'd with the sharpest Woes. Degraded from vain Honour here we grow More great and high, as Trees by lopping do. Honour's like Froth in each Man's Glass of Beer; 'Tis least of use, tho topmost it appear. The common Vouchee for ill Acts she's grown; It and Religion all our Mischiefs own. She reigns in Youth with an unruly Heat, And in her falser Mirror shews them Great, Till Age and Time convince them of the Cheat. Rash Heads approve what sober Men despise, And the fantastick Garb offends the Wise; She rarely now is seen, but in Disguise. True Honour and plain Honesty's the same; From various Dwellings comes the various Name: For whilst she's gay in Courts, she's Honour there, But Honesty with us in Durance here. Indiffering States, most things have difference: What pleas'd this day, the next offends the Prince. The Prosperous loath what the Afflicted love; Prisoners abhor, what free, they did approve: And still there's Power in each Man's Choice to make Himself content, if he can wisely take, And think his own (tho hard) a happy Stake. In every state does some Contentment dwell, And here we find a Palace in a Cell. Good's good ev'ry where, and every thing, And Good can of it self no Evil bring. All Good's a Ray of the first Light alone; When Ill approaches, only that's our own. Vertue's not gain'd by spending of our Days In Pleasure, Prince's Courts, or from their Rays. At Vertue's Coast by Travel we arrive, And so by Travel Vertue's kept alive. She dwindles if she want due Exercise; But us'd, grows brighter, and still multiplies. Vertue increases Snow-ball like, roll'd on: A lazy Vertue's next of kin to none. Pris'ners indeed they be, that do lay by At once their Freedom and their Industry. If Men turn Drones within these hony'd Hives, It lies i'th' Pris'ner's Heart, and not his Gives. The Good grow better here, the Bad grow worse; The Spur that makes this go, does jade that Horse. Hence the great'st part are Male-content and Sad, Since that the Good are fewer than the Bad. A Bliss that springs from penitential Joy, Is the Mind's Balsam in each sharp Annoy; Fools only their own Comforts do destroy. To this Retirement we can freely go; 'Tis the great'st pace of Majesty below: Our stirring out imports the World to know. The Goaler's Centinel to guard our Doors, And Castles are contain'd i'th' narrow Floors. More happy and more safe, secur'd from Foes, Than those whom Troops of Enemies inclose. Much more as Pris'ners, our high Bliss we boast, Being secur'd from such a mighty Host Of deadly Foes, so fierce with Wrath and Might, Our selves so feeble, and unfit to fight 'Gainst the black Band of Vicious and Profane, Who Thousands do undo in each Campaign. In the Assault, we seldom brook the Field, But fly like Hares, or else like Cowards yield. Yet this the World esteems an hard Estate, And us, who feel it, count unfortunate. Shew then, Philosophy! the State wherein Such Safety, and so much Content is seen; Wherein less rugged or steep Hindrance lies, T'obstruct the Path unto Perfection's prize. The useful Rod's only bound up for this, To whip and lash the Childish on to Bliss; Who sullenly refuse the Rod to kiss, And so the Blessing in the Whipping miss. Some, like the Whale, only design'd to play In fruitless Pleasures, drive the flying Day; As Boys with Clackers drive the Linet away. Whilst here, we stop the hours of Time, that flies, With Contemplation's nobler Exercise. Maugre all Goals, think we e'er long must dye, And then enjoy an endless Liberty; Death will redeem from long Captivity. Man's Life's a Piece spun of a various Thred; In some 'tis fine, in some a coarser Web. The Threds across, th'Occurrences of Fate, Cut early from the Loom by Death or late. The Dread of Kings, Death does not us dismay; To dye's less, than be tantaliz'd each day: What Man complains, with Weariness opprest, That Night is come, the only time to rest? A DIALOGUE between the Dutchess of Clevel? and the Dutchess of Portsmouth, at their Meeting in Paris. With the Ghost of Jane Shore. Cl. Art thou return'd my Sister Concubine, For all those subtle cunning Arts of thine, With which thou didst subdue our Monarch's Heart, And wouldst not let me with thee share a part; Tho my great Beauty did that Heart subdue, Long e're it could so meanly stoop to you? Ports. I am return'd to see my Native France, The Place where first I saw the World by chance. Tho mean by Birth, yet Fortune this can do, Help by the Charms of Wit and Beauty too. Methinks my Port and my illustrious Train, Should rather move your Envy than Disdain. C. My Envy! no, thy Meanness I despise, Thou art a Beggar still, tho in disguise. The noble Ladies of the Gallick Court Will mock at your fine gaudy Train and Port; Thy Converse and thy Company they'll scorn, Since thou of genteel Blood wert never born. P. The King's Example, Dutchess, you will find, Shall make the Ladies of this Court more kind: For many Services for him I'ave done, Which he I'm sure with Kindness now will own. I'ave serv'd him with my Person and my Wit, But how, to tell you, Madam, 'tis not fit. C. If you have ought for this great Monarch done, He'l make you then some Abbess or a Nun. For I do find 'tis not the Guise of France, Their Whores to noble Titles to advance But usually the Royal Miss is sent, To some Religious Cloyster to repent. P. It is not yet that time of Day with me, Nor am I fallen to so low degree; More joyful Days I yet do hope to see. Tho I have here of English Guinies store, I thither will return and get me more. England will me a plenteous Harvest yield, Here to buy Lands and Palaces to build. C. Methinks you talk at an immodest rate, Thou French She-Horse-leech of the English State: Rome us'd to draw its richest Treasures thence, The English Gold was chang'd to Peter's pence: But now that Rome can draw from thence no more, It is enhanced by a Gallick W?. P. If I'm immodest methinks you are vain, Thus idly of my Riches to complain: England did once to you a Harvest yield, Alas! I'ave but the Gleanings of the Field. Gold fell into your Lap with a spring Tide, But you have spent it on your Lust and Pride: Your time is past, and Lust has made you old, And to be serv'd you now must give your Gold; Or fumble with some weak old Clergy-man, To get a Spill your Royet to maintian. C. O Madam, you must needs be very chast, If, as they say, the Prior you embrac'd. I laugh to hear of Chastity from you, As if a Whore was e'er to one Man true. I own my Nature, it is brave and high, With Messalina I my self could vie. Let a dull Husband lie with her that's chast, I by a Prince am fit to be embrac'd. P. Brag not, your decay'd Beauty is grown stale, And all your Arts no longer can prevail: I yet retain my glorious conquering Charms, Whilst you are banish'd from a Monarch's Arms. Alas, your Beauty now is in the Wain, No Art can e'er renew that Face again: Madam, the shining Glories are all set, Which makes you thus at your Successor fret. C. Dull Tool, my Eyes yet sparkle and are good, I feel a vigorous May yet in my Blood; I'm sound and free from any foul Disease, Can warm a Lover and know how to please: Whilst thou corrupted, scentst the very Room In spite of Essences and strong Perfume. I can't but wonder by what Magick Art, Thou e'er couldst conquer a great Monarch's Heart. That Baby's Face of thine, and those black Eyes, Methinks should ne'er a Hero's Love surprise; None that had Eyes e'er saw, in that French Face, O'ermuch of Beauty, Form or comely Grace. P. You are my Rival and may me despise, But Lovers see not with your envious Eyes. If you in Beauty have the greatest share, And if that mine cannot with yours compare, My Wit exceeds, and yours have prov'd but ill, Since you're cast off and I am courted still. C. When I did reign, I like a Queen did show, I sat above and saw crown'd Heads below; Of Jewels and of Gold I had such store, I knew not how to seek or wish for more. To me the Idols of the Court all bow'd, I was adored by the numerous Croud; Till thou wert seen, who with some Magick Spell, Some Charm or Philtre that was made in Hell, Didst my great Hero's Heart then steal away, And took by Hell-bred Arts my Beauty's Prey. This be my Comfort, I did first subdue, They were my Leavings that were shar'd to you. P. It shows my Wit and Beauty had most Power, When I subdu'd your mighty Conqueror: And that I broke into your Beauty's Charms, And ravished your Hero from your Arms. I'ave rul'd as well as you, and my French Pate Has div'd into the great Intrigues of State: In Balls and Masques you revel'd out your Nights, But, Madam, I did relish State Delights: My Politicks and Arts were deeper bred, Than ever came into your shallow Head. Vain Pride and Pleasure were the things you sought, Whilst that four Kingdoms did imploy my Thought. States-men did know that you were but a Fool, But they from me took Measures how to rule. C. And yet I see you are turn'd off at last, And all your cunning Policies misplac'd. P. You are deceiv'd, and I shall make you mourn, When you shall see me, Madam, back return: Mind you your Pleasures, game your time away, My business will not let me longer stay, To our great Monarch I have much to say. C. If back to England thou shouldst e'er return, May thou become the common People's Scorn. May against thee the London Prentice rise, And may they pull out thy bewitching Eyes. Against that time I will go learn to curse, That Pox or Plague I'll wish thee something worse. What Specter's this! P. O Heav'ns, what have we here! My Joints do tremble and my Soul doth fear. The Ghost of Jane Shoar to them. Ghost. Perhaps you know me not, yet take a View, See what I am, I was once such as you, I was a Whore, a Royal Mistress too. I was a Woman of egregious Fame, And like you too I gloried in my Shame, Edward my Lord was, and Jane Shoar my Name. I liv'd in Splendor and enjoy'd Delights, Feasted all Day, and in Love's luscious Rites, Between a Monarch's Arms wore out the Nights. But when at last my happy Monarch dy'd, I lost my Riches, Pleasures, and my Pride, And all that e'er was sweet or good beside. Alas, remember what of me became, My Honor stain'd, and black was all my Fame, Scorn of the People, to my self a Shame. A Wretch I grew, wish'd I were never born, Poor and contemn'd, and every Rascal's Scorn, Unpity'd died, most wretched and forlorn. But happy had I been had this been all, Or if that I had had no farther Fall, But Hell on my Misdeeds aloud did call. Tormented in the Flames of Hell below, No Ease from Torment, Pain, and endless Woe, For Pleasures past, my scorched Soul doth know. Short were my Pleasures while I lived here, And those were also mixt with Grief and Fear, But Pain Eternal's in the lower Sphere. You two great Women, great in Lust and Sin, Repent, repent, and to reform begin, For your Reward you Hell at last will win, Rivals look on me, and contend no more, What you are now I once was long before, Yet I am damn'd altho a Royal Whore. A Satyr against Persecution, 1682. The attribution of this poem is questionable. How easy 'tis to sail with Wind and Tide! Small Force will serve upon the stronger side; Power serves for Law, the Wrong too oft's made Right; And they are damn'd, who against Power dare fight. Wit rides triumphant, in Power's Chariot born, And deprest Opposites beholds with Scorn. This well the Author of the Medal knew, When Oliver he for an Hero drew, He then swam with the Tide; appear'd a Saint, Garnish'd the Devil with Poetick Paint. When the Tide turn'd, then strait about he veers, And for the stronger side he still appears. Then in Heroicks courts the Great and High, And at th'Opprest he lets his Satyrs fly. But he who stems the Tide, if ground he gains, Each stroke he makes must be with wondrous Pains: If he bears up against the Current still, He shews at least he has some Art and Skill, When against Tide, VVind, Billows he does strive, And comes at last unto the shore alive. Huzza my Friends, let us our way pursue, And try what our Poetick Arms can do. This latter Age with VVonders does abound, Our Prince of Poets has a Medal found, From whence his pregnant Fancy rears a Piece, Esteem'd to equal those of Rome and Greece. With piercing Eyes he does the Medal view, And there he finds, as he has told to you, The Hag Sedition, to the Life display'd, Under a Statesman's Gown, fancy'd or made, That is all one, he doth it so apply, At it th'Artillery of his Wit lets fly; Lets go his Satyr at the Medal strait, Worries the Whigs, and doth Sedition bait. Let him go on, the Whigs the Hag forsake; Her Cause they never yet would undertake, But laugh to see the Poet's fond Mistake. But we will turn the Medal; there we see Another Hag, I think as bad as she: If I am not mistaken 'tis the same, Christians of old did Persecution name: That's still her Name, tho now grown old and wise, She has new Names, as well as new Disguise. Let then his Satyr with Sedition fight, And ours the whilst shall Persecution bite: Two Hags they are, who Parties seem to make; 'Tis time for Satyrs them to undertake. See her true Badg, a Prison or the Tower; For Persecution ever sides with Power. Our Satyr dares not worry those he shou'd, But there are some felt, heard, and understood; Who Substantives of Power stand alone, And by all seeing Men are too well known; What Steps they tread, and whither 'tis they drive, What Measures take, and by what Arts they thrive. But were these little Tyrants underfoot, How bravely o'er them could our Satyr strut! What Characters, and justly, could he give, Of Men who scarcely do deserve to live! Yet these are they some Flatterers can court, Who now are Persecution's great Support. We on the Medal see the fatal Tower; Truth must be silent, for we know their Power: Whilst they, without controul, can shew their hate, And whom they please with grinning Satyrs bait. This puts our Satyr into fume and chafe; He could bite sorely could he do it safe. Since against such he dares not spend his Breath, Th'Hag Persecution he will bait to death. Old as the World almost, as old as Cain, For by this Hag was Righteous Abel slain; In Tyrants Courts she ever doth abide, Accompanied with Power, with Lust and Pride. What she has done is to the World well known: She always made the best of Men to groan. Her bloody Arts are register'd of old, And all her cruel Policies are told. All that is past our Muse shall let alone, Pass Foreign, and speak only of our own; Our own dear ugly Hag, who now has Power, To send to Tyburn, Newgate, or the Tower. If Power be in the Multitude, not few, They shew that they have Faith and Reason too, Leap not their Bounds, nor do their Power betray, Since they to Laws and Government obey. If other Power they exercise, 'tis Force, Or Rage, that seen in a wild headstrong Horse, The more he's spur'd or rein'd, the more doth bound, And leaves not, till the Rider's on the ground. But far it seems from our Almighty Croud, To boast their Strength, or be of Power proud: Their Power they of old had fruitless try'd, And therefore now take Reason for their Guide. Nay, Faith they have in their own juster Cause, In their dread Sovereign, and his righteous Laws; This makes them thus submit, all Power lay by, For Right, for Law, for Peace they only cry. For this, by some, they are accounted Fools; So generous Horses are mistook for Mules; And some Court Jockies mount them in their Pride, And with a Satyr's Heel-spurg all their Hide; Dull Asses they suppose the People are, Made for their Burdens, and not sit for War. All with the forewind of Religion sail, It to all Parties is the Common Stale. I know you'l grant the Devil is no Fool, He can disguise in Surplice, Cloak, or Cowl; But still he may be known without dispute, By Persecution; 'tis his Cloven Foot. Let him be Christian, Pagan, Turk, or Jew, Pretends religious Zeal, it can't be true, If 't Persecution raises, or maintains, Or makes a Market of ungodly Gains. When Rome had Power here, and sat inchair'd, How cruel and how bloody she appear'd! Our Church-Dissenters then did feel the same, Their Bodies serv'd for Fuel to the Flame: And can this Church now, got into the Chair, A cruel Tyrant like to Rome appear? For bare Opinion do their Brothers harm, Plague and imprison, 'cause they can't conform? But stay, our Church has Law upon its side, And so had Rome, that cannot be deny'd. And if these Jehu's, who so fiercely drive, In their sinister Arts proceed and thrive, We soon shall see our Church receive its doom, And feel again the Tyranny of Rome. To bar Succession is th'ungodly Sin, So often broke, so often piec'd ag'in: O may it here in England never cease, Could we but hope it would secure our Peace! But Men with different Thoughts possessed are, We dread th'Effects of a new Civil War. We dread Rome's Yoke, to us 'tis hateful grown, And Rome will seem a Monster in our Throne. How rarely will a Cope the Throne bedeck? A Bishop's Head set on a Prince's Neck? Th'inherent Right lies in the Sovereign's Sway, But then the Monarch must Rome's Laws obey. Head of the Church he must no longer be, But give that Place unto Rome's Holy See. Both of the Church, and him Rome will take care, The Throne must truckle under Papal Chair. Kings can't do wrong, so does the Maxim say, But Ministers of State, their Servants, may. Tho Kings themselves do sit above the Law, Justice still keeps their Ministers in awe; For if they do not make the Law their Guide, Great as they are, by Law they may be try'd; Else we should subject be to every Ill, And be made slaves to Arbitrary Will. O happy Isle where each Man Justice craves! Kings can't be Tyrants, nor the Subjects Slaves. The Laws some great Ones fear, who rule the State; When they can't new unto their Wills create, They to their Minds, with cunning, try to mold, And, with new Images, to stamp the old: What 'gainst dissenting Papists first was bent, For Protestants now proves a Punishment. Law, Law they cry, and then their Brother smite, As well upon the left side as the right: To every Jayl the Protestants they draw, And Persecution still is masqu'd with Law: We do not know but Rome may have its turn, And then it will be also Law to burn. This is not all, for some ill Men there be, Who would the Laws use in a worse degree: Treason and Traytors, Plots against the State, To reach their Foes, they cunningly create: To Prison then the Innocent they draw, And if they could their Heads would take by Law; But Law is just, and Englishmen are good, And do not love to dip their Hands in Blood Of Innocents: But this has rais'd the Rage Of some Politick Actors on our Stage, And spite of Justice, Law, and Reason too, Their wicked Ends by other means pursue. Those Men, whom they can neither hang nor draw, Freed by their Country, Justice, and the Law, They try to murder with an Hireling's Pen, By making them the very worst of Men. They 'ave Orators and Poets at their Will, Who with their Venom strive their Fames to kill. These rack the Laws, and holy Scriptures too, And fain would make all the old Treasons new: They will not let the Graves and Tombs alone, But conjure up the Ghost of Forty One. With this they try the Ignorant to scare, For Men are apt the worst of things to fear; Tho that Ghost is no liker Eighty Two, Than a good Christian like a Turk or Jew. London, the happy Bulwark of our Isle, No smooth and oily Words can thee beguile: Thou knowst thy Int'rest, that will never lye; Eternal as thy self, the Men do die. 'Tis Truth and Justice that do thee uphold, And richer in Religion than in Gold; Thy Piety has built thy Turrets higher Than e'er, in spite of Plague, of War, and Fire. Without a Sigh we can't think on the Flame, Nor by what Hands, and from what Heads it came. With envious Eyes they do thy Riches view, When old Ways fail, to spoil thee they find new: No Art's untry'd which may thy Coffers drain, For which the subtil Lawyer racks his Brain: Thy too old Charters they will new arraign. Thou must not think thou canst in safety stand, Whilst the false Canaanite swarms in the Land. Some State-Physicians cry, that thou art sick, And on thee they would try some quacking trick: As yet their poisonous Drugs thou dost not need, Nor does thy Body want to purge or bleed. Thy Head we hope with Loyalty is crown'd, Thy Heart and Intrails we do know are sound: Thy Hands are open, honest, free, and strait, And all thy Members pliable and neat; All think you well in Health, and sound within, Tho some few Spots appear upon your Skin, They're but the Purgings of the sounder Part, And are at a great distance from the Heart. The Wealthy love to thrive the surest way, For Gain perhaps they will like Slaves obey. Give up their Charters, bend their Necks, now free, To servile Yokes, and stoop to that degree, As to submit to Rome's curst Tyranny. But sure the Wise, and the Religious too, Will all the just and lawful Ways pursue, To keep that Freedom unto which they're born, And which so well doth Englishmen adorn; Which our Forefathers did preserve with care, And which we, next our Souls, do hold most dear. Let the hot Tories, and their Poet, curse, They spend in vain, and you are ne'er the worse: Alas! they seem as only made to damn, And then curse most when they have lost their sham; They are true Shimeis, or the Sons of Cham. Their Mouths are open Sepulchers, their Tongue With Venom full is ever speaking wrong: With Oaths and Cursings, and with looking big, They seek to fright some harmless peaceful Whig; Then boast the Conquest, hector, rant, and tear, And cry, God dam'um Protestants they are: All the Fanaticks are a cursed Crew, Worse than the Papists, or the Moor, or Jew: The City is a Laystall full of Mire, And ought again to be new purg'd with Fire: All Honesty, all Godliness they hate, Love Strife and War, Contention and Debate. These are the Men from whom much mischief springs, Whilst their bad Cause they falsly make the King's. These wrong the King, and then to make amends, With Oaths declare they are his only Friends: But these are they who Coleman would outdo, Blow up both Kings and Kingly Power too. For why is all this Contest and this Strife? This strugling in the State, as 'twere for Life? When all Men own'd their enjoy'd Happiness, And daily did their belov'd Monarch bless? But these ill Men all common Roads forsake, O'er Hedges, and thro standing Corn they break; Tho ill Success they have, they will not cease, Till they have spoil'd the Nation's happy Peace. They see none to Rebellion are inclin'd, Yet Plots they make, where Plots they cannot find. But their Designs they did so idly frame, The Evil on their Heads return'd with shame; And tho they find their evil Projects curst, They keep the Impudence they had at first: 'Gainst Honesty, Law, Reason, then they fight, And falsly cry, The King can have no Right. The People of their Judgment they bereave, No Proof, no Circumstance will they believe: Rebels and Traytors they will still create, And are Men-catchers of the highest Rate. With Regal Rights these Men keep much ado; But, with that Stale, their own Game they pursue: Their Monarch's Safety, Honour, Fame, Renown, The great Supports and Jewels of the Crown; The Peoples Love, their Freedom, Liberties, Those they neglect, and these they do despise. What e'er these Men pretend, the jugling Feat Is plainly seen; 'tis to grow Rich, and Great, To Rule, to Sway, to Govern as they please: The Peoples Grievance, and the Land's Disease. All Men that would oppose their Pow'r and Sway, And will not them, like Gally-slaves, obey, They brand with odious Names, altho they spring From Fathers ever Loyal to their King: Tho they themselves Sons of the Church are known, Would with their Blood defend their Monarch's Throne, And ready are their Lives to sacrifice For all their King's just Rights, which much they prize. But O the Change that's now in England seen! They who are Loyal, and so e'er have been, Because they will not serve sinister ends, Are Rebels call'd, at least call'd Traitors Friends. Thou wicked Hag, that now art arm'd with Power, That wouldst Mens Souls and Bodies both devour, That now dost show thy bloody armed Paws, With Malice arm'd, and with too rigid Laws; With what Poetick Curse shall I thee paint, Who art a Devil, yet appear'st a Saint? But Vengeance for thee still in Heav'n there's store, Tho many bless, and Thee the Beast adore, Thou'rt dy'd with Blood, and art the Scarlet Whore. O Persecution! thou'rt a Goddess blind, That never sparest any Human kind; In every County thou dost footing gain, In all Religions thou desir'st to reign, But never wast admitted in the True. Hence grow our Tears, that here thou shouldst renew Thy Strength and Power in this happy Realm, Our Quiet and our Peace to overwhelm; When for some Years thou hast been banished, And Protestants believ'd thou hadst been dead; Or that at least, we never more should fear That thou shouldst live to shew thy Power here: Unless (which Heav'n avert) that thou shouldst come By Force, brought in by the curst Power of Rome. But griev'd we are, to see it in our Age, And fear it may a greater Ill presage. Prisons and Fines the Punishments are now, But who knows what at last it may come to? For this damn'd Hag longs still for human Food, Ne'er satisfy'd till she is gorg'd with Blood. Well may the Papists, when they have their turn, Rack and imprison, torture, hang, and burn; When Protestants to Protestants do shew, That had they Pow'r, themselves as much would do. But let the busy Ministers take care, They do but Vengeance for themselves prepare: For in all Ages it was ever known, That God his Vengeance on their Heads pour'd down. All but mere Fools may easily foresee What will the fatal End of these things be; If one bigotted in the Romish way, Should once again the English Scepter sway; Then those who in the Pulpit are so loud, Preaching Succession to the vulgar Croud, Must change their croaking Notes, their Coats must turn; Or, if prove honest, fly the Land, or burn: Whom Benefit or Ignorance engage, Now to the Party, then shall feel the Rage Of those fierce Tyrants, who now undermine, And hidden carry on their curst Design. The proud usurping Priest, and Popish Knaves, Shall be your Lords, and all the English Slaves; The Nobles then must wear the Romish Yoak, Or Heads submit unto the fatal Stroak. Oppression will grow bold, the Tadpole Priests Shall lift above the Lords their Priestly Crests. T'attempt or struggle then will be in vain, For Persecution will a Tyrant reign. Her fatal Pow'r will then be understood, And she will glut her self with Martyr's Blood. The Pope's Supremacy shall then be shown, No other Head in England will be known: Then shall a general Curse flow thro the Land, Lord against Lord, Friend against Friend shall stand; Till at the last, the Croud, in their Defence, Provok'd to Rage, arm 'gainst their Popish Prince: With Words no longer, but with Arms they'll jar, And England will be spoil'd with Civil War; True Peace and Happiness so long shall want, Till she shall get a Monarch Protestant. Thus Factious Men to Civil Broils ingage, And with their ferment make the Croud to rage: Their Madness, they in others would increase, Yet wipe their Mouths, and cry they are for Peace: For King, for Regal Rights, and true Succession, They in the People's Ears still make Profession; Yet for one Man, such Friends they are, so civil, They'd send almost three Nations to the Devil. But there's no way these Mischiefs to prevent, Unless we have a healing Parliament. Of that these faulty Men love not to hear, They've much transgrest, and much they have to fear. Until that day, England will find no rest, Tho now she slumbers on her Monarch's Breast; But then the Nation will be truly blest. An Elegy on his Excellency Lieutenant-General Talmash, 1694. By Mr. Edm. Arwaker. I. Since Heav'n from Albion's once lov'd Isle estrang'd, Has into Frowns its benign Aspect chang'd; And pleas'd to interrupt her Joys, The Blessings she in her great Talmash found, With which her Fields, while grac'd with him, were crown'd, Severely in their Author them destroys, And in her tendrest part gives her a mortal Wound: Why, in this great Occasion to complain, Does Albion seem insensible? O why suppress her Sighs, her Tears restrain? Nor offer at her Patron's Herse A Sacrifice of Monumental Verse? That might her Grief, great as her Suff'rings, tell; And celebrate the mighty Name That swells the Registries of Fame, That Name, whose just Applause is the main source of hers? II. Rouze, you ungrateful Scribling Crew, VVho with your Tribute of gross Flatteries come To wait on every meaner Tomb, But where you shou'd be loudest-tongu'd, are dumb; Think what is to the Name of TALMASH due; Of whom the VVonders you declare, So far from Adulation will appear, They cannot reach his glorious Character. Justly to Him your Praise belongs, VVhose great Exploits gave you a copious Theme, And did inspire each Muse with Thoughts sublime, In imitation of them, But still, alas! inferior to him, The noblest Subject, and the best Rewarder of your Songs. For as his Vertue did exalt your Strains Above the pitch of common Thought and Sense, He amply did requite your Pains By his unparallel'd Munificence; He made your Laurels fructify, And rais'd you to the heights of Poetry, Freed from the Pressure of its Indigence. III. Raise then your Voices, and his Praise declare, Thus to the World you will your Verse endear, And ravish every listning Ear. Tell of his noble Aspect, graceful Mein, In which Beholders took a strange content, Fitted to hold the Glorious Things within, And what it did contain, to represent. There Wit and Sense were in Abundance found. But lest, as Waters that their Banks o'erflow, These Streams shou'd shallow by Dilation grow, A solid Judgment did their Courses bound, Which still preserv'd their Depth and Current too, And made their Silence, as themselves profound; Not noisy with Impertinence, The certain mark of a low ebb of Sense. IV. Nor did his Courage to his Wit give place; As great, and yet as quiet too it was; Free from all offers of Offence, Conceal'd within his Breast it lay, As Seeds of Fire hid in their Parent Stone, Nor easily wou'd it be tempted thence, Till urg'd by Provocation, The angry Sparks forc'd thence their burning way, And made his real Brav'ry known, That cou'd resent a wrong as well as offer none. But if his Country, dear as Life or Fame, Bid him unsheath his Sword in its defence, His Blood was quickly in a Flame, And in each Vein beat brisk Alarms, To call her great Defender out to Arms; Such for her Weakness was his Shame, Such of her Suff'rings was his tender Sense. V. Hibernia, that unhappy Land That boasts her wholesom Soil no Venom breeds, Yet never wants Rebellion's pois'nous Seeds, Her Empress Albion durst withstand, And strove to wrest the Scepter from her Hand; Who then so fit in Albion's Cause to fight, As he who did in Albion's Peace delight, And was the great Asserter of her Right? Talmash is sent her Vassals to reduce: Talmash the Brave, who cou'd not brook to see An Arbitrary Pow'r her Laws abuse, And cramp her Native Liberty: Him she desires, him she's oblig'd to chuse; Nor cou'd she find in her Heroick Store, One that wou'd study her Advantage more, Or in her Cause be more of Life profuse. VI. Athlone, by Art and Nature fortify'd, Put a strange Non-plus to the English Arms, Their Courage baffled, and their Strength defy'd Doubly secur'd from Harms, Till Talmash found a way they did not dread, (Since such a dangerous Enterprise No Courage durst attempt, no Thought design but hi[illeg.] A way as unsuspected as unknown, At once to gain their River and their Town; Follow'd by Numbers of admiring Friends (Who wou'd not follow where he led?) Into the Shannon boldly he descends, As Cæsar once into the Rubicon; Th'affrighted River from him fled, Quitted its Post, and did to Lym'rick hast, (The Rebels strongest Refuge, and their last) Nor thought its Stream had now sufficient speed; While to th'astonish'd Town he safely pass'd, And on the conquer'd Walls his flying Ensigns plac'd. Thus daring Minds no difficulty know, The Courage that in great Attempts they show, Enables them to conquer what it leads them to. Soon War's loud Tumults in Hibernia cease, Subjected to her Sovereign's Pow'r: Pleas'd with the Blessings of his gentle Reign, The Golden Plenty, and the Downy Peace, Which, as his happy Conquest did restore, His more triumphant Goodness does encrease; And now she tunes her Silver Lyre again, To sing her Liberty regain'd, Which, if unconquer'd, she had ne'er obtain'd: Since she no longer business does afford, To exercise our Hero's Sword, He hastens to the Belgick Shore, That does his strong successful Arm implore, To free it from th'encroaching Gallick Pow'r, Which with the Title of Most Christian dress'd, Does Christendom worse than the Turk infest. VIII. But to suppress this pow'rful Foe, And wound him deeper with a nearer Blow, The British Navy is for France design'd, France must again that dreaded Courage know, That Courage that had often brought her low; And whom cou'd Albion, but her Talmash, find That with more Vigour wou'd her Armies head, Or one by whom they wou'd be rather led? Whose dreaded Name, like Talbot's heretofore, Wou'd through those Fields her Fame more largely spread, And fright French Children, but their Fathers more, The English Bravery in France well known, And own'd peculiarly Ours, Which last inglorious Age out-liv'd, And long lay bury'd with our Ancestors; In Talmash was reviv'd, And we th'Original must own Amended and enlarg'd in this Edition. IX. But, Oh! what Pow'r, envious at Albion's Joy, Blasts her with a malignant Breath, And does her gaudy blooming Hopes destroy! Scarce had he touch'd th'inhospitable Shore, Which all around for fear began to roar; When from th'Encounter of a fiery Storm, A swift, tho heavy Messenger of Death, Too well its hateful Errand did perform, And forcing a remoter part Made way for Fate too soon to reach his Heart, And boldly tell him he must be no more. When this th'advancing Soldiers knew, Cold as he their Courage grew, France had no way but this to shock them so: Their General's Life is all their care, Which to preserve they hastily retreat, The Fate of France and their Revenge defer, To wait on a Concern more near and great. X. Back to his native Soil convey'd, His drooping Head he on her Bosom laid, And in her Service wasted, yet untir'd, As fearless as he liv'd, expir'd, And for the Breath she gave too largely paid. France by his Death already grown too proud, Wanted the Honour of his Grave: This Privilege injurious Fate allow'd, To be for Albion reserv'd, Whom as his Life he lov'd, whom with his Life he serv'd: Nor cou'd she next his Life a greater Blessing crave, Than to preserve him dead, who her alive did save. XI. See Albion, see thy General brought home, Not crown'd with Conquest, as he us'd to come, But by inconstant Fate betray'd, Himself a bleeding Victim made; Ah then dissolve into a briny Flood, And let it flow in Consort with his Blood. But, Oh! The precious Balm is shed in vain, No Virtue is in that or Physick found To keep out Death, and heal the gaping Wound: That Sluice does Life's whole treasure drain. Not all thy Sighs can him with Breath supply, Not all thy Pray'rs his fleeting Soul recal, But in thy Arms thy Champion must dye, Pleasing himself with what thou do'st lament, The loss of Life in thy lov'd Service spent, And only deems the Sacrifice too small. Since then for Thee the gen'rous Talmash dies, To his great Memory just Trophies raise, For which he Death may prize! That his pleas'd Soul from its exalted Seat May triumph in his Fate, So well deserving and so full of Praise. While in a peaceful Grave his Body lies The Guardian Relique of our Isle, Berkeley in France performs his Obsequies, And makes whole flaming Towns become his Fun'ral Pile. Greenwich-Hill. A Poem. By Mr. MANNING. Since every Mountain, where the Muses come, Is call'd Parnassus, and induces some Poetick Friend to celebrate its Name: Here, Greenwich, I attempt to sing thy Fame, Led by the Wonders, which my ravish'd sight Views from thy lovely Park's aspiring Height. O! could I make my Numbers but attain To Denham's sweetness, not his Hill should gain A rise o'er thee, nor yet Proportion hold With thy just Fame, which I could then unfold With greater Force, transported with each Grace So charming, that surrounds the lofty Place. Then shouldst thou be to me as that to him, Parnassus was, and merit more esteem. For that, exalted by his Muse alone, Without his Song had still remain'd unknown: But thou by Nature such Renown dost claim, Thou want'st no Poet's Art to give thee Fame. And if thy various Beautys I could trace, As they deserve, with more than common Grace, The Writer's Credit, and the Poem's Fame Would spring from thee, whilst thou art still the same. Here then my rising Eye, before my Feet Ascend the Mount, so fair a Pile doth meet, As in a Poet's Fancy well might prove Apollo's Palace, or the Seat of Jove. And the aspiring Hill, on which 'tis laid, Might be Parnassus, or Olympus made. This View, which of a sudden strikes my sight, Fills me with so surprising a delight, That I'm o'erjoy'd at what I can descry From hence, nor wish more limits to my Eye. And viewing well this Prospect's beauteous Store, It gives me wonder to be promis'd more. Thus in some Painter's outward room we find Enough to please and to surprise the Mind: And when the Artist labours to invite Our Eyes to more variety of Sight, We part not without Pain from what before We saw so pleasing, that we wish'd no more. No steep Ascent discourages our Feet, But all so fair, and regular we meet, That fill'd with Joy by gentle Steps we rise To that fair House, which first confin'd our Eyes. But there arriv'd, and turning to look down, We wonder that we reach'd the height so soon. This House, erected at a Charles II. King's Command, Displays the Goodness of a Royal Hand; Nor is't, tho small, unworthy of that Fame, But high, and graceful, as its Founder's Name. Here, Flamsted, mounted to this lofty Seat, Where all the Arts of thy Profession meet, Thou shew'st Mankind how much improv'd by thee Are all the Wonders of Astronomy. Thou, Reverend Man, from thy auspicious Hill Canst all the Secrets of the Stars reveal. Thy Astrolabes are made with so much Art, They can the distance of the Sun impart; Disclose a Paralax i'th' Heavenly Sphere, And shew the Place of every wandring Star. Now shall we fear no more mistakes, we see Celestial Motions all set right by thee. Nor need we mourn Great Archimedes Sphere, Lost tho the finish'd Labour be, since here In thee reviv'd his Genius doth appear. Nor doth thy Hand the hoarding Miser play, But all the Uses of thy Art convey To serve Mankind. Now Flamsted, give me leave Here from thy Walls that Prospect to receive, Which Nature's wide Indulgence doth afford To each surveying Eye. Here mine descending from the Hill, salutes A pleasant Vale, whose constant Beauty sutes The Queen's fair House, that seems below to vye With equal Grace the Pile that stands so high. More sate, for this like every lofty State Is liable to Envy or to Hate, The Blasts of Fortune, or the Rage of Winds, Which spoil the proudest, and the best Designs. Whilst that, like one with milder place content, Is less expos'd, more firm and innocent. Here shouldst thou dwell, my Muse, at least reveal What Gratitude forbids thee to conceal: That entring here, amidst the various Paint, By Rubens.Old as it is, disdaining to be faint, The Muses we behold divinely fair, With all the proper Emblems of their Care. And here, O teach me to unfold that Birth, Which dignifies so much this Spot of Earth, That of the Great Eliza, [so renown'd In all the Arts of Empire. and so found In Fame's Immortal Volume] in whose time True English Worth most flourish'd in this Clime. And as it rose with her, so her Decrease Made that decline, and almost with her cease. So doom'd a while, till Nature gain'd Recruits, Improv'd the Soil, and brought forth better Fruits. Here should my Praise enlarge, but that my Eye, Too quick for Thought, beholds a Valley nigh: Whose flow'ry Pasture oft invites to graze Whole Droves of the Horn'd Herd, a fearful Race, The Hunter's Pastime, now retir'd for Shade Beneath a lofty Hill, by Nature made A common and a safe Retreat, to shun A Northern Tempest, or a Scorching Sun. Here they delight to wanton, play, and rove, To make their Courtship, and enjoy their Love. Rambling they love, nor are to one confin'd, But free as Air, and uncontroul'd as Wind. No Law they know, but guided by their Eyes Take their own Choice to love or to despise. How then is Man deceiv'd! how weak, how vain Is he, who thinks by Reason to obtain Advantage over Brutes, who know no Cares Of racking Love, no Hopes, or wild Despairs; But run with Joy the destin'd Course of Life, Ty'd to no Rule, no Slavery, no Wife! Whilst we triumphing falsely o'er their State, Misguided by our Reason, soon or late Split on the fatal Rocks of Love and Hate. Behind the Queen's another Royal Pile Next courts my view, the Hope of Britain's Isle; Charles II.A King's Foundation, and design'd his Seat, When State-Affairs would suffer his Retreat: When Care of Empire, and the Toil of Power Had well prepar'd Him to enjoy an Hour. Close to the Banks of Silver Thames it stands, With Majesty it rises, and commands A noble Prospect, for at once it views An English Fleet, our Isle's Defence, and shews A Mixture of all Nations and of Things, Which the kind Flood receiving, hither brings. The View, I mean, it brings, for all the Store Unlades it self upon the Neighb'ring Shore Of the Fair City, whose extending Side Swells in my Eye with so August a Pride, So near me too, that did not here my Muse Urge a Suspence, I could not well refuse More than a transient Offering to its Praise, But that's reserv'd a while my Thoughts to raise Upon another View. Crossing the Stream that flows between the Pile And the next Shore, we view a spacious Isle, Whose Bosom teeming by an ambient Flood, Produces Plenty of such wholesom Food, That grazing here, the worn, abandon'd Steed Regains his Vigour, and renews his Speed. Now gentle Thames, concern'd for our Delight, Presents a hundred Windings to our Sight; Which as they turn, still flow with such a Grace, Giving so much Advantage to each place They run between, that no Mæander shows Such Turnings, or so fair a View bestows. See with what joyful hast he takes his Course, Yet how serene, and how averse to Force. No rapid Waves throughout his Channel roll, Yet swift as Fame, that flys without controul. Tho lib'ral, yet within his Bounds he flows, And tho reserv'd, he visits, as he goes, The neighb'ring Meads, and cherishing the Earth, Presents the Mower with a plenteous Birth. O happy Thames, whose Current could invite Immortal Denham's Muse, thy Praise to write! Now shall thy just Preeminence o'er all The Ocean's Sons, by no Endeavours fall: By no dark Cloud of Malice be o'ercast, As long as his Eternal Work shall last. Next Windsor, rising with a stately Meen, Shews his proud Head, aspiring to be seen So far remote from hence, tho here it seems A distant Mountain only, when the Beams Of a clear Sun diffuse not o'er the Place Their Brightness, to disclose its Frame and Grace. High as the God's Olympus, seems the Hill On which it stands, and shining doth reveal A Palace as Majestick, and as Fair, As Poets fruitful Heads have fancy'd there. Thou, Windsor, too art happy in the Praise Which the same Heavenly Muse to Thee did raise. Who knows not now thy Beauty, and thy Force, Thy matchless Heroes, and their Warlike Course, Thy Garter's first Original, and Fame, By Kings esteem'd an Honour to their Name? Here when Desert has challeng'd from the King Thy Order, what Profusion doth it bring Of Pomp and Beauty to thy stately Quire! How do we throng to gaze, and to admire! And tho devouring Time has left no Name Of thy first Founder in the Books of Fame: Yet this we know, that to suspend thy Fate, 'Twas II. Charles repair'd Thee, and enlarg'd thy State. Now, gentle Muse, assist me to return To the King's House, that was so long forlorn, Abandon'd, left unfinish'd, till a Queen, [Equal in All to great Eliza seen, Her Godlike Bounty, and capacious Soul, The Arts of Empire, and Success of Rule: Now equal too in Death, alas! O Weight Of most uncomfortable Woe!] Partly in pity to its falling State, But more by Love conducted, and by Fate, Fond of her People's Good, spread forth her Mind, Renew'd the Building, and its Use design'd For poor, disabled Seamen, whom the War Invading should deny from Wounds to spare. See how the busy Lab'rers urge the Pile, That is to succour, and oblige our Isle. Some hasten to extend its Walls, and some Adorn the inward Roof, whilst these assume The carving Part, and every Order shape, And those surveying let no Art escape, That may advance the Beauty of the Frame As shining, as its second Founder's Name. Just so the Bees, when Summer is begun, Spread o'er the Fields, and labour in the Sun. Part cull the blooming Flowers, &amp; load their Thighs With various Sweets, and part with humming Crys, Emit their Young; whilst others to relieve The most oppress'd, their Burdens do receive, And bear them Home, where other Bees salute Their safe Arrival, and dispose their Fruit Within their Cells, or with unwearied toil Thicken the liquid Juice, and guard the Spoil; Whilst others rang'd in gallant Order, drive The Drones, a lazy Insect, from their Hive. All urge the Work, whilst the Nectarean Food Exerts a fragrant Odour from the Wood. Now shall our England flourish, and extend Its Greatness to the World's extremest End: For since so noble a Support was made By William's Bounty for the Soldier's Trade Before at Chelsey (whose sweet Fabrick might Suffice alone for ample Theme to write) By this enlargement of the Royal Mind, The Nation's Soul shall be no more confin'd: But wheresoe'er our Fleets or Armies go, We'll spread our Glory, and insult our Foe. Here rest, my Muse, awhile to ease my sight, Which grows unsteddy with the distant flight My Eyes have made; then gently hover round What lies behind, and view the lofty Ground. Whilst I refresh my self beneath the Shade Of an adjacent Grove, supinely laid, To ease my Limbs oppress'd and faint with heat, Greedy of rest, impatient for retreat. There will I lie, and wait thy airy flight, Rise at thy Call, and spread again my sight. But 'tis in vain I beg a space for ease, Not so the Muse, whom I invoke, decrees. Grown passive I to her Impressions bend, Walk a few steps, and then my Eyes descend Upon a Visto, whose unlook'd-for sight Strikes me with such amazement of delight, That I no longer my Complaints pursue, But find new Vigour from the healing View. So for a while an absent Friend we mourn, And beg of Heav'n to hasten his return. But should some lovely Dame invade our Eyes, Whose Aspect fills us with a sweet Surprize, No more we feel the Torments of our Grief, But from each charming View we gain relief. Here my transported Eye, thro even Rows Of Trees, which Mountains shelter and inclose, Meets with so distant and so fair a sight, So much variety of true Delight, That I'm concern'd, lest doubting which to chuse My dazled Eyes amidst the heap should lose Part of the beauteous store. Assist me then Here, my companion Muse, and teach my Pen To set in order what my sight commands, And praise each worthy Object as it stands. First then my careful Eye reviewing down, Salutes the Chappel of the Neighb'ring Town: Here the bright Dames that dwell about the place, (And Greenwich boasts of some, whose heavenly Grace Commands remembrance) daily come to pay Thanks for those Blessings which their Charms display; Humble in all their Beauty may concern, But proud to those who for that Beauty burn: Not imitating Heaven, that was so kind To grace their Bodies, and inrich their Mind. Else would Aurelia match the purest Flame, That ever touch'd a Heart, or found a Name. Aurelia, in whom sparkles every Grace, Juno in Mein, and Venus in her Face. Aurelia, whom the Groves and Walks reherse, The Ornament and Grandeur of my Verse. But O! the same both Groves and Walks repeat, That Thyrsis lies still dying at her Feet. Next the fair River offers to my view A rising Grove of Ships, that gently flow In with the Tide, whose shaded Waters seem To be no part of the incircling Stream: Which might be ta'en for Land, as here it shows, But for the Motion which the Ships disclose. Tall Sons of Oak, that on the Waves aspire To lift themselves above their lofty Sire That grew at Land, and by the help of Sails, Waiting for Seasons, and for prosp'rous Gales, Spread the wide Ocean o'er, and for our use Bring home the Riches that all Climes produce: Whilst the whole World with fear &amp; wonder meets Our Flags, and pays low homage to our Fleets; Which still with all their Pride my Eyes can trace, Winding the River to salute that Place Which claims their just Obedience, and gives To them that Succour it from them receives. Here London swelling, doth it self present So stately, and with such a huge extent, That my fix'd Eye, with admiration fill'd, Dwells on a View, that such a Scene doth yield Of lofty Monuments, that rise so high, As if they would again the Heavens defy, And make the Earth contiguous with the Sky. Among the rest, contending for the Height, Two the most eminent engage my Sight: Both with such state, and such a tow'ring rise, As if they scorn'd the reach of humane Eyes; But swell'd with emulation would aspire To be consum'd in Elemental Fire. As Rival Statesmen, scorning to abide An Equal, often sink beneath their Pride. In a more humble, yet a sweet Ascent, The City's Fortress doth it self present Full in my Eye, and with an easier Face (In all its compass Strength unites with Grace) Diverts the horror of the former sight, Rais'd by the Rival Spire's amazing height. From hence our numerous Armies are supply'd With all their Stores, here William can provide For greater Forces, nor would yet the Place Appear exhausted, but disclose a face Of vast surrounding War, to shew our store By him made endless, as our Isle secure. Here are the Regal Ensigns kept with care, In solemn state, amidst the Pomp of War. An Emblem of our Monarch's lofty Name, Who has so much surpass'd all Kings in Fame, In Fields of Battel, and at home in Peace, Born to Triumph, and make Disorder cease. Nor does this famous Tower alone disclose Peculiar Wonders of our own, but shows Variety of Creatures hither brought By curious Men from Countries far remote, As Presents fit for Kings, who here maintain The Captive Beasts, such as the Lybian Plain, And Desarts of wild Africk once obey'd As Lords of all their Wast, and barb'rous Shade. Till Men by Stratagem their Power controul'd, And dar'd to seize them in their strongest Hold. Now my unsteddy Eye removing flys O'er all the lofty Buildings; and espies Beyond their wide Extent a spacious Hill, Whose gentle rise, and fruitful sides reveal A beauteous Prospect, and whose tow'ring height Looks o'er the stately Town, and bounds my sight. Its lofty Top seems level with the Sky, Affording Wonder, as it gives me Joy: Whilst o'er its wide, extended face is seen Perpetual Bloom, and ever-springing Green. In allusion to Sir John Denham.O could I rise like thee, and make thy Height The graceful Measure of my Muse's flight! Bounded tho wide, tho mild, yet full of state, High without Force, without aspiring Great. Here, Hamsted, I should dwell upon thy Praise, Search all thy Beauties, and delight to gaze Upon thy Face, could but my lab'ring Eyes Preserve their Vigour, and avoid Surprize. But such thy Distance is, and such thy Grace, That dazled with thy Lustre, and the Space That lies between, my strain'd o'er-burden'd sight Is forc'd to lose thy Beauty, and thy Height. But so surrounded is the lovely Hill, Whereon I stand, with Perspectives that fill My Eyes with Admiration and Delight, That wheresoe'er I turn, I please my sight With some new Prospect, such Variety, Such mixture of Extremes in all I see, Of Joy and Wonder, that my ravish'd Eyes Descry throughout a perfect Paradise. But that which most delights me, is that pair Of Groves, where all that's pleasant, sweet, or fair In Art or Nature, doth oblige my sight, And where a Maze of Walks might well invite The God of Love to keep his amorous Court, His wanton Revels, and his Midnight Sport. The Muses too with all their Train might here Indulge their Thoughts apart, nor interfere With other Pastime, but apply their Trade, Tune all their Harps, and court Apollo's Aid. Then in a critical well-chosen Hour, The God inspiring, use his offer'd Power. O happy Groves, that thus may conscious prove Of Heavenly Numbers, and Celestial Love! Here, various Dames we see, divinely bright, Walk in these Shades, when Time and Air invite. Doom'd to disquiet we their steps pursue, And unprepar'd feel Wounds at every view. But O! Aurelia shoots the keenest Dart, Which not my Sense alone, but pierces thro my Heart. As in the Groves of lofty Cynthus, when Diana walks with all her shining Train To seek some cool Retreat, each lovely Maid Reflects a thousand Graces thro the Shade. The Goddess by her Stature, Shape, and Air, Majestically tall, proportion'd, fair, Surpasses all the rest: such here we see Aurelia, when she leads her Company Within the Groves of this delightful Hill; So doth she shine, such Excellence reveal. O lovely Greenwich, how dost thou surprize Our Souls with Wonder, and with Joy our Eyes! Thy num'rous different Beauties to reherse Requires the strength of more exalted Verse. Fain would I trace them, but my stock of Art Is unproportion'd to the willing part. Yet sure 'twere stupid to forget to name The Ranger of thy Park, so high in Fame. DORSET the Patron, and the Rule of Wit, The Nation's Honour, and the Court's Delight: The Soul of Goodness, and the Spring of Sense, The Poet's Theme, Reward, and Great Defence. Here when the restless Toil of being Great, Makes him retire from all the Pomp of State, Free with a chosen Friend, he takes his Ease, Unbends his Mind, and tasts the Joys of Peace: Reads o'er the Poets with impartial Eyes, And then determines who shall fall or rise. So in old Rome, when weary of Affairs Of State, Mæcenas would release his Cares; Fond of Retreat, with Horace only blest, He left his Grandeur, and his Joy confest: Judg'd with like Freedom what the Romans writ, Which was base Metal, and which Standard Wit. Prince Butler's Tale: Representing the State of the Wool-Case, or the East-India Case truly stated, 1691. The ARGUMENT. Shews why this Tale in Verse is wrote, How 'twas begun o'er the Ale Pot; Shews Rise and Progress of the Trade To India drove, and who 'twas made The first steps to our Wool Trade's Ruin, And how it prov'd to Folks undoing; What done to stop its further Growth, And how those Measures came to nought; How Golden Fleece lay very dead, How Act for burying it was made; And how, if we were truly wise, We should their Trangums all despise, Our Mony save, imploy our Poor, From starving keep, and from our Door; Who then could drink, some Ale, some Sherry, And laugh, and quaff, and all be merry. PROLOGUE. In place one day as I was standing, Where Folks were printed Papers handing To those that wou'd, or read, or buy 'em, These Remarks made, as I stood nigh 'em: I saw a mighty, zealous Crew, Some for Old Stock, and some for New, Were pro and conning their hard Cases, By the chief Dons of several Classes: 'Mongst which Grandees I sometimes fell in, And heard most dismal Stories telling; The one the other much arraign'd, And Credit of their Causes stain'd. Thus having heard each side complain, Methoughts it was apparent plain, That some 'mongst both were Knaves in grain. I saw a Case concerning Wool, With Reasons stuft, both clear and full; Which plainly shew'd our certain ruin, These mighty Talkers were pursuing: Yet saw, that many, at first sight on't, There were that made but very light on't, And found there were but few attend it, But very few that would defend it. Amaz'd I stood, and much dejected, And in my Mind was much affected, So great a Cause should be neglected. Soon after that, I saw, with Vigour, Verses catch'd up, 'bout fight of Tyger, By Old and Young, by Fools and Witty, And by the great Dons of the City. Thought I, this Case, if I should write In such a manner, Folks would buy't, And read, for sake of Doggrel Rhime. Which Thought improv'd, I lost no Time, But presently o'er Pot of Ale, Writ a great part of this sad Tale, Which, if you like, you may have more on't, For I now have, or shall have store on't. The TALE. When first the Indian Trade began, And Ships beyond the Tropicks ran In quest of various Drugs and Spices, And sundry other strange Devices, Salt-petre, Drugs, Spice, and like Trading, Compos'd the bulk of all their Lading: Bengals, and Silks, of Indians making, Our Merchants then refus'd to take in, Knowing it would their Country ruin, And might prove to their own undoing. Nor did they carry Gold or Bullion, To fetch home what supplants our Woollen; Nor were this Nation fond to wear Such Indian Toys, which cost so dear: Then were we clad in Woollen Stuffs, With Cambrick Bands, and Lawn Ruffs, Or else in Silk, which was imported For Woollen Goods, which we exported; Which Silk our English Weavers bought, And into various Figures wrought. Then scarce a Child was to be seen, Without Say Frock, that was of green: Our Hangings, Beds, our Coats, and Gowns, Made of our Wool in Clothing Towns. This Nation then was rich and wealthy, And in a State which we call'd healthy. But since the Men of Gath arose, And for their Chief Goliah chose, Who with Re'boham's Couns'llers clos'd; And since that mighty Giant's Reign, Whose chiefest Aim was private Gain, This Trade was drove on by such Measures, As soon exhausted much our Treasures. For then our chiefest Artists went With Patterns, and with Mony sent, To make and purchase Indian Ware, For which this Nation pays full dear. Then by great Gifts of finest Touches, To Lords and Ladies, Dukes and Dutchess, So far prevail'd, as set the Fashion, Which Plague-like soon spread o'er the Nation. Our Ladies all were set a gadding, After these Toys they ran a madding; And nothing then would please their Fancies, Nor Dolls, nor Joans, nor wanton Nancies, Unless it was of Indians making; And if 'twas so, 'twas wondrous taking. This antick Humor so prevail'd, Tho many 'gainst it greatly rail'd; That all Degrees of Female kind, To Indian Ware were so inclin'd, That nothing else could please their Mind. Tell 'em the following of such Fashion Wou'd beggar and undo the Nation, And ruin all our labouring Poor, That must, or starve, or beg at Door; They'd not at all regard your Story, But in their painted Garments glory; And such as were not Indian proof, They scorn'd, despis'd, as paltry Stuff: And like gay Peacocks proudly strut it, When in our Streets along they foot it. This Humour strangely thus prevailing, Set all the poorer sort a railing, Or else with Grief their Case bewailing. The richer seeing what was doing, And how the Nation ran to Ruin, To King in Council did complain, In time of Charles the Second's Reign: On which were several Lords appointed, By him who was the Lord's Anointed, To hear the Case, and sad Complainings Of those that then were for Restrainings; Who plainly did their Lordships tell, What Mischiefs to our Trade befel; How both our Men and Bullion went To work in India, and be spent In needless Toys, and gaudy Dresses, For Ladies, Madams, Trulls, and Misses. The Case thus heard, they were inclin'd Some proper Remedy to find; And something was in order doing, To put a stop to further Ruin: But by the Craft of great Goliah, Who all the Host stood in defy-a, There is this Story passing current, That say 'twas he that stop'd this torrent, By pouring Gold in plenteous Showers, In Ladies Laps, who bore great Powers; Which strongly alter'd all their Measures, Such Charms there are in hidden Treasures. Thus barrocading all Complaints, Drove Jehu-like without Restraints, Fill'd Town and Country soon so full, As ruin'd much our Trade in Wool: And such great Stocks of Wool and Clothes, Were hoarded up, and eat by Moths, Made Clothiers all, and Growers grumbl'd, When Clothes and Fleeces o'er they tumbl'd. And further Mischiefs to prevent, Complaint was made in Parliament: And 'cause the Wool so near affected, This Salvo for't was then projected, That since the Living would not bear it, They should, when dead, be forc'd to wear it. This help'd in part, but the Grand Ill Remains upon the Kingdom still. Yet this our Ladies so offended, As all our Female Sex contended, And fain would had this Act rejected: But then their Counsels were neglected, And Time has reconcil'd it so, To this Wool Act they're now no Foe; So that from Ladies great, to Skullion, All buried lay in our own Woollen. And happy thrice would England be, If, while they're living, we could see, Our noble Ladies but beginning To wear our Wool of finest spinning, Or in such Silks our Workmen make, For which our Merchants Cloth do take; Which soon wou'd bring them in such Fashion, As they'd be worn throughout this Nation, By all Degrees, and Sex, and Ages, From highest Peers to lowest Pages; Nor would the meanest Trulls or Besses, Delight to wear these Indian Dresses, Which certainly would Profit bring, To them, their Tenants, and our King, And Heaven's Blessing in the Bargain, Because they'll keep our Poor from starving. For they wou'd soon be then employ'd, Our Mony too at Home wou'd 'bide. And happy then both Great and Small, With Mirth in Parlour, and in Hall, When thus, with Plenty, Beards wag all. EPILOGUE. And now this Tale, thus far being ended, Methinks I see some Folks offended, And 'gainst this Doggrel Poet rail, Because he've told so plain a Tale; And New and Old Stock, Jobbing Throng, Crying it down, be't right or wrong: But if they do, and away fling 'em, 'Tis a great Sign they're Truths that sting 'em. But let them spend their Lungs, and hollow, Such blustring Sparks he need not value, Since all his Aim, and his Designs, Are to beat down their Indian Blinds, That all true English-men may see What cause their real Misery, That so they may prevent their Ruin, And save this Nation from undoing. But if they still will shut their Eyes, And Demonstrations plain despise; And if his Tale shall be rejected, Or if this Cause be still neglected, He only this has more to say, That he can shift as well as they, And that he writ this not for Pay. Grace before Meat at a Christning. Bless the good Ladies and good Food, That Heav'n has set before us, And may we Men prove all so good, That Women may adore us. May these thy fruitful Dames live long, Grow every day more handsome; And may their Husbands prove as strong I'th' back, as Second Sampson. May they dance merrily each Night Without a Pipe or Tabor, And Mother Midnight bring to light The Fruit of all their Labour. God save the Queen, and send Peace thro the Realm, Men may obey, and Women rule the Healm. Grace after Meat. Our hearty Thanks we humbly pay For the Blessings we have tasted; Lord send such Christnings every Day, That we may thus be feasted. We bless thee for each merry Dame, And her good Conversation: O bring them yearly to the same Blest end of their Creation. May they abound in Girls and Boys, Yet still and still be kist on; That we may meet, and thus rejoice To make each Babe a Christian. Bless all good Women in their married State, Make their Pains easy, and their Pleasures great. The Dog in the Wheel. A Satyr, 1705. Once in a certain Family, Where Idleness was disesteem'd; For antient Hospitality, Great Plenty, and Frugality, 'Bove others famous deem'd: No useless Thing was kept for show, Unless a Paraquete, or so; Some poor Relation in an Age, The Chaplain, or my Lady's Page: All Creatures else about the House, Were put to some convenient Use. Nay, ev'n the Cook had learnt the knack, With Curs, to save the Charge of Jack; So train'd 'em to her purpose fit, And made 'em earn each bit they eat. Her ready Servants knew the Wheel, Or stood in awe of Whip and Bell, Each had his Task, and did it well: Tho for their Labour well they sped, They far'd like those were better bred, No Chaplains cou'd be higher fed: Fine season'd Dishes fit their Maws, Swimming with curious sav'ry Sauce; The Dripping-Pan, no Dainty was. Plates heap'd with Fragments they devour, The Footman just had lick'd before, Wou'd make a Poor-man's Mouth run o'er. High season'd Olio's, sav'ry Meats, With many fine delicious Bits, Became their daily Fare: Sometimes a Capon's half-pick'd Rump, At which a hungry Priest would jump, Would happen to their Share: Till full, and wanton, they'd retire, And bask, and play before the chearful Fire. One proling Cur, of little use, That stragling went about the House, Bark'd at the Door, a milking ran, Lazy and proud, as any Serving-man: Was good for nothing that I know, But poor and saucy, like abundance more, That still at Dinner-time would go, And cringe, and hanker at the Kitchin Door. And if the Cook but turn'd her back, He'd many a sleeveless Errant make, For Hunger, and his Belly's sake: Tho, like a Thief, by stealth he came, His Stomach could digest the Shame. And thus he squeez'd himself one day, In a submissive Fawning way, He took occasion thus to say: ‘I wonder, Gentlemen, that you ‘This servile Life will undergo; ‘Your Ancestors were better bred, ‘In noble Sports their Lives they led, ‘And from their Master's Board were fed: ‘They brought home Game to load the Spit, ‘And ne'er to turn it would submit: ‘While you for Whips and Spurns must look, ‘At ev'ry Fart that wrings the Cook. ‘Tho, pardon me, so plain I speak, ‘I do it for our kindred sake. ‘'Tis true—You may do what you please; ‘But e'er I'd lead a Life so base, ‘(For I don't covet any Place) ‘I'd starve about the House in Peace. This said—the Cook came in at last, And seeing him amongst the rest, She call'd him very gentle to'er, And stroak'd the smooth submissive Cur: Who soon was hush'd, forgot to rail, He lick'd his Lips, and wag'd his Tail, Was over-joy'd he shou'd prevail Such Favour to obtain. Among the rest he went to play, Was put into the Wheel next day, He Turn'd, and Eat as well as they, And never Speech'd again. Those Lords of deep reaches, With popular Spheeches, That dang'rous Chimæra's inveigh, Were they put into Place (As we judg is the Case) Who'd sneak, or be tamer than they? But since we incline To thwart the Design, And let 'em unheeded rail on; His Lordship may speak A fresh Speech ev'ry Week, And take a fresh Wh?re ev'ry Moon. There's none 'twill offend, Tho he misses his End; Or if his Pretensions are double: He may humour the Mob With another such Job, There's some slight Amends for the Trouble. On the Death of Serjeant Darnell, 1706. Renowned Phiz! kept Evidence in awe, Yet smooth'd the wrinkled Forehead of the Law, Is made, by Death, a Morsel for its Jaw. Swop down he went, in Parchment-skin wrapt close, Instead of Coffin, and in Paper Clothes; He left his Friends, and grin'd upon his Foes. Strange hand of Death that spares nor Man nor Woman, The Chancery Lawyer, or the Lawyer Common, And grants a Habeas Corpus unto no Man. The talking Serjeant talk'd, but talk'd in vain, Could not the Judgment of Death's Law restrain, So rais'd his Head, and laid it down again. Death to the Sentence did stand stiff and firm, Tho mov'd Imparlance to another Term; Death will the Sentence maugre Quirks confirm. Whither he's gone I shall not dare to say, Whether the darkest or the brightest Way But that he's gone, I will a Wager lay. If to the sooty Shore he's thither gone, I'll pass my Word he'l hardly there find One, Of Phiz more dismal or Complexion. Well, since he's dead and gone, e'en let him go, Shall we lament because the Case is so? I boldly answer positively, No. A Collection of some Satyrical Prints, publish'd beyond Sea, relating to the Affairs of Europe, since the French King plac'd his Grandson on the Throne of Spain. With their Explanations in English. [When Anjou stept into the Spanish Throne] There needs little Explanation to this Cut, the Figures and the Postures explain themselves. The two Kings, Lewis the XIV. and his Grandson Philip the V. are the Persons represented sawing the Globe; the Devil Ambassador from Porto-Carero, supports it; and Madam Maintenon to make the Saw go glib, waters it with her own chast Stream. When Anjou stept into the Spanish Throne, The mighty Monarchs thought the World their own. They set their Saw to cut the Globe in two, And share both Worlds the old one and the new. But tough they find the knotty Work, and flinch, Before the grating Tool has gain'd an Inch. Old Maintenon, who sees how hard they draw, Steps on the Ball and whets the rusty Saw. But tho she lets her lower Fountains play, The Monarchs sweat in vain to saw their way. They pay for what they get in either Spain, And lose a thousand Foot for one they gain. [The Conquests Anna by her Chiefs has won] In this Cut is represented the Sun in an Eclipse; or Lewis XIV. eclips'd by Queen ANNE. On the right Hand in the same Square are two Astrologers, taking their Observations; Queen ANNE is in the Center, on a Throne, holding the Cock, whose Wings she clips to prevent his Flight, in her Hand. The Figures on each side of Her are Her Counsellors and Generals. The Fleet in the Corner on the left Hand side is, Admiral Leak's Triumphing over the Count de Toulouse Admiral of France. The Battel on the right-side of the Sun is drawn for that of Ramilly or Judoigne; the Church of the last Town appearing at a little distance. On the other side of the Sun, the French King and his dear Wife or Mistriss Madam Maintenon are represented in close Conference. The Conquests Anna by her Chiefs has won, The Sun was in an Eclipse on the 12th of May, 1706. the same Day on which Philip the V. made a shameful Retreat from before Barcelona.Eclipse the Glories of the Bourbon Sun. Her rising Lustre spreads as his declines, And faintly like the setting Day he shines. Her Fleets and Armies o'er the World convey Her Fame, and triumph o'er Tyrannick Sway. She vindicates the Cause of injur'd Kings, And clips the Gallick Cock's presumptious Wings. [Hast thou surpriz'd me, Britain! I defy] This Figure represents the Duke of Bavaria in a terrible Passion, after the Duke of Marlborough bad forc'd the French Lines, in the Year 1705. The less Figures are, the Marquiss D'Alegre, and the Count De Horn, Prisoners in the Hands of the English and Dutch. Hast thou surpriz'd me, Britain! I defy Thy Force, and will in Fight my Fortune try. Thy Chains, my chosen Troops, my Generals wear, My Lines are forc'd, and I again despair. My Martial Trophies are in Triumph born, To grace thy March, and I'm the Publick Scorn. Let Valour, and not Art decide the Day, My Soldiers may not always run away: But Oh! Thy brighter Greatness still will shine, And all my Glory be eclips'd by Thine. [The Sun, and that's my Crime I'm told] The Person represented in this Cut, is Prince Lewis of Baden asleep: the Sun, by which is meant the French King, shining upon him; a Town at a distance above him, and Armies below. He lays his Hand on a Bag of German Ducats, a Bag of English Guineas, another of Spanish Doublons, and a fourth of Louis D'ors; which occasion'd the Pun, Louis D'ort, Lewis sleeps. In another Cut, The Seven Bags in the left Corner of the Cut a top are, The Profits of his Post. Free Gifts. A Pension from France.Magazines not fill'd. Roman Right. Contributions. His Income by Forage. The Sun, and that's my Crime I'm told, Is apt to make me doze; And what keeps others stirring, Gold, Inclines me to repose. How sweet 'tis to grow Rich asleep! My Conduct who can blame? And you, who such a Pother keep, If try'd, wou'd do the same. [What shall we do, dear Maintenon? my Son] The Figures in this Cut represent Lews the XIV. in a mortal Fright on an Eclipse of the Sun the 12th of May 1706. and Philip the Fifth's being driven out of Spain. That young Prince is drawn upon his Knees, petitioning his Grandfather for leave to come home again. And Madam Maintenon advises Louis le Grand to send the Confederates a Blank to procure a Peace. Lou.] What shall we do, dear Maintenon? my Son Flies from the Foe, and we are all undone. Brabant and Flanders to the Austrian yield, So much we suffer'd when we lost the Field; O why am I thus wretched! Maint. To be plain, I'll tell you why, to flatter you's in vain: The fam'd Partition-Treaty was the Cause, And England's just Resentment, and Nassau's: You own'd a Prince whom they refus'd to own, And poor Bavaria's by your Arts undone; You trickt the Portuguese. Lou. The Sun, my Dear, Is now eclips'd, and bodes some Ill, I fear. Philip.] Good Grandsire, take me in again, my Fall Is great, and you have been the Cause of all. Lou.] My Love, my Queen, now tell me what to do, For on thy Counsel I depend. Maint. Be true, Keep to your Word, forgo your usual Fraud, For which you're curst at home, and loath'd abroad, Send the Confederates a Blank. Lou. 'Tis done; What other way was left to save my Crown? [Ye Heers and Hogans all, We greet you well!] These Figures represent a French Trumpet and Drum sent by Louis le Grand, to enquire News of several Citys lost by the Mighty Monarch last Campaign, 1706. Ye Heers and Hogans all, We greet you well! Can any of you Tale or Tidings tell Of goodly Citys lost, both far and near, Gaunt, Brussels, Antwerp, Dendermond, and Liere, Aeth, Ostend, Bruges, Mecklin, Lovain, Menin; all Flanders, and the half of Spain, Rodrigo, Barcelona, and Valentia, Coria, Saragosa, and Placentia, Almaras, Salamanca, Alicant? Guns, Mortars, Bag and Baggage too, we want. Great Lewis says, if you can bring 'em forth, He'l pay you, if you'l trust him, what they're worth. [In vain the French before Turin prepare] In this Cut is represented the Duke of Orleans's Disgrace before Turin; which is figur'd under the shape of a Bull, from Taurinum its Latin Name, deriv'd from Taurus a Bull. The Flame and Smoke which the Beast breathes, shews the vigorous Defence that City made; and the Tomb underneath signifys the Destruction of the French Officers who were bury'd before it. The Executions in the Cut, are the French Officers, whom the Duke of Orleans, represented with the Wheel in his hand, order'd to be hang'd or beheaded for Cowardice. In this Defeat the French lost almost all their Horse, 13 Regiments of Dragoons, their Bag, Baggage, Colours, 200 Pieces of Cannon, besides Mortars; 30000 Men, and 500 Officers kill'd or taken. In vain the French before Turin prepare The dreadful Storm, and push a fatal War. The Lombard Bull with frightful Fury roars, And with deep Wounds the fierce Assailants gores; Shoots from his brazen Mouth a thousand Deaths, And Smoke &amp; Flame from his wide Nostrils breathes. Rashly the Foe to sure Destruction come, And where they sought a Trophy, find a Tomb. [The Royal Almanack] There is another Figure call'd the ROYAL ALMANACK, wherein the Course of the Sun is exactly mark'd, viz. The Progression of Lewis XIV. the Gallick Sun, thro the 12 Signs of the Zodiack, and his Course in the 12 Months of the Year. In which Figure the French King is represented sitting on a Throne with a lighted Torch in his Hand, and round him come these Sayings, to show to the World the great wicked Actions he has done, Viz. Aquarius, the Water-bearer. He makes Kings; declares the pretended Prince of Wales King of England, 1701. January.] He entertains abdicated Kings, as James II. King of England, A. D. 1689. Pisces, Fishes. Sells Offices, with a false Promise of the next Heir's enjoying them. February.] Plunders the Enemies Ships, tho he has granted them Passes. Aries, the Ram. Sets up a Bank of Credit without a Fund, 1702. March.] Erects Idols, and would have his Subjects worship his Statue on Horse-back. Taurus, the Bull. Commits Incest with the Dauphin's Wife, 1680. April.] Gives a false Coat of Arms, three Flower de Luces, instead of three Toads the true Arms of France. Gemini, Twins. Breaks Treaties, as the Partition-Treaty, 1700. May.] Steals Towns; Old Brisac taken by Treason, 1703. Cancer, the Crab. Promises the King of Portugal 40 Ships, sends him but Four. June.] Leud Generals taken out of a Baudy-house. Leo, the Lion. Poisons the Duke of Bavaria's Son, Heir to the Crown of Spain. July.] Makes Women Privy Counsellors, as Madam Maintenon. Virgo, the Maid. Makes a Whore of La Valiere, 1667. August.] He burns the Palatinate, 1689, 1690. Libra, the Ballance. He Legitimates his Bastards, particularly the Duke de Main his Son by Madam de Montespan, 1673. September.] His Hypocrisy in oppressing the Cevennois, and assisting the Hungarian Rebels. Scorpio, the Scorpion. His Sacrilege in Germany, Italy, &amp;c. 1705, &amp;c. October.] He forces the Cevennois to turn Papists, 1702, &amp;c. Sagittarius, the Archer. He commits Adultery with Madam de Montespan, 1670. November.] His Massacres in Holland, 1673. at Bodegrave, Swammerdam, &amp;c. Capricorn, the Goat. Highers and lowers the Coin as he pleases, and calls it in, and intends never to restore it. December.] He is the Christian Turk; enters into an Alliance with the Great Turk against the Christians, 1688. A New Dialogue between Joseph the Just, and Lewis the False. In the First there is a long Dialogue in Dutch and French, between the two Monarchs represented in it, viz. The present Emperor of Germany, and Lewis the French King; suppos'd to be spoken after King Philip's flying from Madrid, 1706. The Substance of which Dialogue is as follows. There are several other Prints, which being too chargeable to copy, we shall only here give some Description of four of 'em, both in Prose and Verse. Jos. Dear Cousin, why so melancholy? Lov. Why? Have I not Cause, when all my Armies fly; Bavaria, Villeroy, Berwick, Thesse. Whole Kingdoms lost? Jos. 'Tis hard I must confess, But you a King most Christian, Coz, shou'd bear With Christian Patience what you feel or fear. Lov. Patience, nor you, nor your Allies should name, Nor such as prosper the unprosperous blame. You know not, Cousin, what it is to lose A Crown, and such a Crown as my Anjou's. What shall I do with the poor hopeless Boy, Who late was all my Hope and all my Joy? Jos. Do with him? Coz, since he was born to rule, E'en make him Usher of some Country School: There he may whip the Lads that learn to spell, As Dionysius the Sicilian Tyrant, when he was expel'd, turn'd Pedagogue. Denis did of old, as Stories tell. [My Husband me, and I my Court have left] In the Second the present abdicated Electress of Bavaria is represented in a melancholy Posture, complaining of her hard Fate, to see her Husband driven out of Bavaria and Flanders, and her self and Children forc'd to fly for Protection to the State of Venice. The Cock is the Emblem of France, to which she and her Family owe all their Misfortunes; and the Square on the top of the Cut is the Elector of Bavaria's Hospital. My Husband me, and I my Court have left, Of Friends, of Fortune, and of Hope bereft. The Cock, who like a Dunghil-Craven crows, And struts when he's at Home and far from Foes, No sooner sees the Roman Eagle rise, But trembling from th'Imperial Bird he flies. Oh whither can I run from my Despair! My Sons O whither, and my Daughters bear! Ne'er will my Sufferings nor my Sorrows cease, And never shall I know the Sweets of Peace. Fair Venice, ever kind to the distrest, Alone will entertain the wretched Guest: Thither with all my Load of Woe I fly, And for my ruin'd Lord with fruitless Wishes sigh. [When Anjou by Ruvigny was compel'd] The Third Cut represents a very melancholy Conference between Lewis the XIV. Madam la Valiere, Madam de Montespan, Philip the V. the pretended Prince of Wales, the Duke of Berwick, the Count de Tolouse, Mareschal Thesse, and others, on the dismal Prospect of the Mighty Monarch's Affairs, after Philip the V. was driven from Madrid, 1706. by the Earl of Galway. When Anjou by Ruvigny was compel'd To quit the Spanish Empire with the Field; To Council Lewis calls his Sons, a Store As great as good King Priam had of yore: His Concubines among the rest were there, And English Modena's pretended Heir. Much Moan, and not a little Noise was made, And all the Fault upon the Monarch laid; Who nothing in his own Defence can say, But that for Help to The Patroness of Paris. Genevieve he'll pray: And if he sues the Female Saint in vain, The Crown of France must follow that of Spain. [This Paper-King, who knows his Right] The fourth Figure represents Philip the V. flying from Madrid on the Approach of my Lord Galway, at the Head of the Queen of England's and the King of Portugal's Troops. He is drawn cutting the Hangings, in which some of his Predecessors are painted, at the Escurial, as he actually did, and taking away with him the Records, the Crown of Spain, and Porto-Carero's mock Will, which is his only Title, from whence he is here called the King of Paper. This Paper-King, who knows his Right Is, like his Paper-Tenure, slight, Had rather run you see than fight. The Treasures of his Court he steals, And trusts his Safety to his Heels. What Monarch would the Field refuse, That had so much to keep or lose? But he his Grandsire's steps persues, Who always did his Person save, And ne'er was but by Proxy brave. The Tunbridge Prodigy. Written by a Lady. Protect our State, and let our Marlbro' thrive, Keep our crown'd Heads this wondrous Year alive; Preserve our Palaces from Wind and Flame, Safe be our Fleets, and be our Scotchmen tame. Avert, kind Fate! whate'er th'Event may prove, For here's a PRODIGY, a Man in LOVE. Wasted and pale he languishes in Sight, And spends in am'rous Verse the sleepless Night. Whilst happier Youths to careless Spirits born, View the Distress with Pity or with Scorn; And Maids so long unus'd to be ador'd, Think it portends the Pestilence or Sword. How chang'd is Britain to the blooming Fair! Whom now the Men no longer make their Care, But of Indifference arrogantly boast, And scarce the Wine gets down a Buckworth for a Toast. Not so (as still their Works declare) it prov'd When Spencer, Sydney, and when Waller lov'd; And with soft Numbers wing'd resistless Darts, Nor thought their Passion less'ning to their Parts. Then let such Patterns countenance his Fire, Whom Love and Verse do now afresh inspire, 'Gainst all who blame, or at his State admire. And learn ye Nymphs how to regain your Sway, And make this stubborn Sex once more obey. Call back the Fugitives by modest Pride, And let them die with Fear to be deny'd. Stay till their Courtship may deserve the Name, And take not every Look for Love and Flame. To Mercenary Ends no Charms imploy, Nor stake your Smiles against some raffled Toy. For every Fop lay not th'insnaring Train, Nor lose the Worthy to allure the Vain. Keep at due distance all Attempts of Bliss, Nor let a Whisper seem to steal a Kiss. Dance not upon the Green but with some Swain, Whose long Endeavours may your Favour gain. Nor be transported when some Trifler's View Directs his giddy Choice to light on you. Amend whatever may your Charms disgrace, And trust not wholly to a conquering Face. Nor be your Motions rude, coquet, or wild, Shuffling or lame as if in nursing spoil'd. Slight not th'advantage of a graceful Mien, Tho Paris judg'd the Prize to Beauty's Queen, When Juno mov'd, Venus could scarce be seen. Assert your Power in Paradise begun, Born to undo, be not your selves undone, Contemn'd and cheap, as easy to be won. But if like Sov'reigns you maintain your Ground, The Rebels at your Feet will soon be found. And when with such Authority you move, No new Surprize, no Prodigy 'twill prove To see one Man, or the whole Race in Love. To the Author of The Tunbridge Prodigy. When Tuneful Ladies strike the trembling Lyre, And give the Raptures of a double Fire; With Joy we croud officious Mites of Praise, And with the tender Myrtle join the Bays. Bright Beauty's Charms are frequent in our view, But brighter Fancy seems confin'd to you; Many pretend to Rays where B?h shines, Yet all acknowledg your superior Lines. That known Artillery of Eyes we 'scape, And fear not Fate in a familiar Shape; But Notes unusual cheat us into Wounds, And Darts surprize us in the Dress of Sounds; So strangely can the Force of Words invade, By which we're conquer'd, as the World was made. Let others on the Senses Surface play, And purchase fleeting Honours of a Day; Your Empire's lasting, for the Mind's your Throne, And ev'ry Hour you gain upon Renown; A greater Wonder, than you sing, you prove A Dame of Wit exceeds a Man in Love. So when of late th'Immortal Granville strove To shew no Magick like Inchanting Love, He broke the Power himself design'd to raise, And prov'd a stronger Magick in his Lays. No future Coldness shall secure the Men, If Nymphs observe your soft instructive Pen, And, as you write or move, direct their Choice, Your Mien is only second to your Voice. Thus learning Excellence, and taught to reign, Your Sex must be all Conquest, ours all Chain; Each trifling fair one shall have Right to boast, And ev'n a H?s shall be confest a Toast. Then the next Prodigy, how chang'd 'twill be! Not he that's captiv'd, but that dares be free. The Phenix Youth that burns in am'rous Pains, Forgets his Anguish, and attends your Strains; Strange and surprising he with Pleasure shews, Who would not languish to invite your Muse! He thanks the Charmer that so rais'd his Flame, And boasts his Fate because he serves your Fame. Thus a poor drooping Ranger of the Air, Depriv'd of Plumes by some unheeded Snare, When Beauty stoops to gather up the Spoil, And gains new Glory from that humble Toil; No more he pines, but tunes his Throat for Joy, Proud that his Feathers can the Fair employ. On the French Subjects. Born under Kings, our Fathers Freedom sought, And with their Blood the God-like Treasure bought: We, their vile Offspring, in our Chains delight, And born to Freedom, for our Tyrants fight. On the Duke of Marlborough. By Dr. BRADY. 1 How, Glorious Marlbro', shall we sing thy Praise? How shall we match thy Laurels with our Bays? What Muse can stretch her Wing o'er Blenheim's Plain, Ramillia's Field, and all the Grand Campaign? Success alone the Privilege can claim, Of keeping pace with Thee, in this swift Race of Fame. 2 Shou'd all the mighty Nine their Pow'rs unite, 'Twou'd strain their Pinions to attempt this Flight; And first they must some humbler Trophy sing, Poictiers and Cressy, and a Captive King; Thence by Degrees to Marlbro's Triumphs rise, The Pitch of English Worth, and Glory's noblest Prize. 3 O cou'dst thou but impart thy generous Fire; Cou'dst thou as warmly as thou fight'st inspire: Then British Bards, swell'd with Ecstatick Rage, Shou'd make our Times outvy th'Augustan Age: Ev'n Maro's Muse as far excel'd shou'd be, As Tyber is by Thames, or Rome's best Sons by thee. The Royal Ramble, 1697. Of Ramblings and Follies you oft have been told, Since (their Wits and their Language confounded of old) Our Fathers Knights Errant from Babylon strol'd. The Macedon rang'd for Drink, Women, and Glory, And Cæsar for Matter to pen a fine Story. Ambition and Love sent old Tony a madding; And People will fancy why Sheba ran gadding. Next Chivalry flourish'd, till Fate proving kind, The Heroes and Lovers to Bedlam confin'd: Then Mankind with wandring Devotion possest, To Relicks and Shrines weary Journeys addrest, On Pilgrimage holy. The Loretto Church Bilkt her Lodgings, and left the poor Turk in the lurch. Of Byrnham Wood Travels, Scotch Chronicles talk, And Kynaston Hill (as Stow tells us) did walk. Sticks and Stones may prove Blockheads, and keep a damn'd Stir, But Things that have Reason and Sense should not err. Will our Nephews believe, that a Prince should outrun (And no Friend to withhold him) his Country and Throne? 'Tis Nonsense so obvious, they never will bear it; Tho Glanvile should write it, or Titus Oates swear it. With a Rabble of Princes an Hero was come, To see those strange Sights he had heard of at home, On a rusty Throne long had he reverently snor'd, By his Brother Brutes envy'd, by's Subjects ador'd; For he thought like his Dad, that the Joys of Mankind Were to Brandy and Wenches by Heav'n confin'd, Till Fame (so well skill'd in her Banter and Lies, As to make Cutts a Hero and Williamson Wise) With Dreams of strange Pleasure, and hopes to grow great, Took a Fancy to puzzle his Worshipful Pate: Of Countries she told him, and quarrelsom Crowns, Fam'd for cutting of Throats, and demolishing Towns, Where the old Men were sage, and the Youngkers all brave; That is, th'one was a Fool, and the other a Knave: Nay she swore, 'twas a Shame that a Monarch shou'd rest Content with his Ease, and well pleas'd to be blest, While all Europe was mad, (nor she hop'd would be wiser.) From the Atheist of France to the bigotted Keisar. So young Mr. went out without writing or reading, To Sardam for Study, and Holland for Breeding. Strait an Embassy thither is order'd to go, To make a fine Speech, and a very brave Show; But lest that his Nobles mistook in their Story, Or fail'd in their Credit should tarnish his Glory, Disguis'd in the midst of their Train he was got, As Teague us'd to carry the Letters he wrote. Thus a Whimsey of Fortune transform'd the poor Czar, From the Pride of the North, to an aukward Dutch Tar. So Jove from his Glories and Godhead releast, When he rang'd for new Joys took the Shape of a Beast. To Amsterdam came; having view'd the whole City, He star'd, and he scratch'd, and he swore it was pretty; But Sardam alone (like his Mosco) could find Joys worthy of Czar, and conform to his Mind: 'Twas there with his Friend he had formerly made A Smith (but the Great Turk himself has his Trade) To study a Science so wond'rous he staid. It was there that his Praise on their Anvils all rung; It was there that he hammer'd, he drank, and he sung: So Vulcan of old, from Divinity tost, In the Joys of a Forge found the Heaven he lost. But Venus to crown all his Glories did fail, Till Love pierc'd his Heart with a Ten-penny Nail, Which from bonny Kate he mischievously stole, Kate, the Smith's only Hope and Delight of his Soul, With Eyes bright as Fire, and black as a Coal: Eyes that with Pleasure her Lover behold, In a Region like Ætna, what Nymph could be cold, Or with nice Resistance could baulk the warm Joy, Where the hardest of Metals grow gentle and ply? Thus he liv'd, and with Fetters so soft ne'er had strove, Till Honour all envying the Conquest of Love, In the Name of the Tars, to Texel did cite him, To a Farce of their own, they were sure would delight him; With Musket and Feather, the Youth of the Town, In Hoys, and in Dung-Boats were nimbly drawn down; A well-whisker'd Tar was the Head of the Show, Whose Fame and Mustachios did equally grow. He mounted in one Yacht, the Czar in another, Resolv'd to distinguish themselves in the Pother: But what Muse is able to tell the wild Rout; How these gave Broad Sides, and how those tack'd about; Till the Admirals boldly resolved to close, And venture for Fame, there was no fear of Blows? And now mighty Actions had surely been done; Much Prowess display'd and great Honour been won, Of which the Courants, and the Gazetts had rung, And Ballads unborn might hereafter have sung. But Fate (which still sports with the mightiest of Things, Breaks the strongest Designs, banters Heroes and Kings) Made the Rain to pour down, and the Weather to blow; Besides dismal Groans did resound from below. Some thought 'twas de Ruyter, who loudly proclaim'd, That of each aukward Folly his Ghost was asham'd. But others in Nether-Dutch Sounds not unknowing, Say 'twas nothing but Frogs, disturb'd by their rowing: But whether it were the old Phantom they fear'd, Or whether they fancy'd what never was heard; Their Trouble was great, for away they all slunk, The Dutch to their Brandy, the Czar to his Punk. On his Grace the Duke of Marlborough Going for Holland, March 1707. In Imitation of the third Ode of the first Book of Horace. Cæsarem Vehis. Thrice happy Barque, to whom is giv'n The Pride of Earth, and Favorite of Heav'n: Thy every Guardian God implore, And waft th'important Charge to Belgia's Shore; Where Councils yet suspended, wait Britannia's last Resolves, and Europe's Fate. So may the Winds with constant Gales Fulfil thy Purpose and inspire thy Sails; Nereids and Nymphs attend thy side, Thy glitt'ring Stern protect, and gilded Pride. Bold was the Man, and bravely good, That tempted first the Sea's impetuous Flood, Heard the Waves roar, the Tempests blow, And sought in Foreign Climes the distant Foe: That made his Country's Glory known, And for the publick Weal despis'd his own. Auspicious Isle, in vain design'd, By jealous Fate, a Stranger to Mankind, Since uncontroul'd thy Of-spring reign, And sport and triumph on the harmless Main! To manly Souls, resolv'd like theirs, No Task has Danger, or no Danger Fears. Hence, Spirits of a Patriot-Mould, Daringly Great, and fortunately Bold, Climbing th'Imperial Seat, combine To sift the baffled Claim of Right Divine; And to the World Instruction gave, Distinguishing the Subject from the Slave. Then lawless Pow'r receiv'd its Doom, And Liberty reviv'd with Native Bloom. Tho Nature, frugally inclin'd, Has all her Gifts to narrow Bounds confin'd; What will not Art and Pains supply? O'er Waves forbad in winged Tow'rs we fly, And with Herculean Toil advance, To shock the Pow'r of Hell, the Pride of France. Nor Heav'n it self is uningag'd, In Wars for Freedom, and for ANNA wag'd; Rouz'd by her pious, just Alarms, Behold! th'avengeful Thunderer in Arms, Surveys the Field with Slaughter spread, And points his Churchill at the Tyrant's Head.
