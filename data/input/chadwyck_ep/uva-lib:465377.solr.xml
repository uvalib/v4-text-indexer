      <field name="fulltext">TO MRS ARCHIBALD FLETCHER.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PASTORAL, OR LYRIC MUSE OF SCOTLAND. Canto First. When shall the woes of War and Discord cease! When shall the morn of Harmony arise! When shall the dawn of Concord, Love, and Peace, Break through the gloom, and light dark Europe's skies!— Vain dream!—for see! to grasp the blood-stain'd prize, Ambition, maddening, wades through seas of gore, Lists, careless, to the groans and dying sighs Of myriads overwhelm'd, to rise no more; And none but Britons smile, around their parent shore! Oh, deaf to nature! and to bliss unknown! How long shall carnage brutify mankind? Whirl'd in tempestuous storms, by pride upblown, How long shall phantoms fascinate and blind? Health—comfort—hope; a gay contented mind, Are all we here can want, or need to crave; And may not these delight, if friendship twined The bonds of love, life's social sweets to save, And gild the traveller's path with sunshine to the grave? One sportive summer's day is all that's given To cheer the transient gleam of insect bliss, Warm'd by the genial influence of Heaven, They burst to life, and love, and happiness: Roving on raptured wing, no ills oppress; Fruition bounds the circuit of their joy;— Shall Man alone no kindred charms possess? Must storm and gloom his summer's day destroy, Nor peace nor social sweets his fleeting hours employ?— Ah me! encompass'd with afflictions drear! Pain—sickness—sorrow, and disastrous fate; The want of friendship's aid, to sooth and cheer, And softening still the murmurs of regret; The loss of all we loved, and prized so late, Torn from the breast, where hope and transport smiled!— Are these not ills enow?—must rage, and hate, And strife, and uproar join in discord wild, Steel the relentless heart, and spurn affections mild? Can nought compose these tumults that repel The gentler throbs of nature, and prevent The playful current of our joys to swell In fond delight, or glide in calm content?— Yes!—Heaven, with all her bounties, kindly sent To mitigate the pangs of human pain, Has given the Muse, with tones mellifluent, To cheer, inspire, and charm in varied strain, With fancy, virtue, peace, and all her smiling train! Lapt in her lays, that cherish and reform, And lure the mind to all that's guiltless fair, Lull'd are the tempests that upheave, and storm The labouring breast of avarice and care; Retirement's calm is all he longs to share Who thrills at nature's glow, and woos her charms; Hails her excitements; paints her beauties rare; Thoughtless of want; unruffled with alarms; And such the bard, I ween! whose breast true passion warms. A time there was:—alas! how changed!—how gone! When worth and friendship link'd each social heart, Awaked by nature's call, in powerful tone The numbers flow'd; free, negligent of art; Warm was the strain! impetuous to impart Whate'er for love or virtue could inspire Affections strong; each Minstrel felt the dart Of passion, kindling with poetic fire, While Pity struck the chords, and tuned the Ossianic lyre. But scared by feud, that gen'rates war and crime, And sweeps the loves and virtues soon away, The Muses, trembling, fled their hostile clime, And wandering, skulk'd, where power, with ruffian sway O'erawed the minstrel band.—Quick changed the lay; Servile and mean, arose a mongrel crew; And, as they sung of spoil and midnight fray, Waked the discordant tones, untuned, untrue, Which Nature never own'd, nor Pity ever drew! Stung with the sounds, oppress'd with grief and pain, Sad, o'er the wild, a sister mourner fled; Her robe, neglected, swept the desert plain, The bleak wind whistling round her laurell'd head; Fast down her faded cheek, late rosy red, The tide of silent sorrow trickling fell!— Ask you the mourner's name?—'twas Music, led By wilder'd grief, her plaintive notes to swell Safe where the Muses sung, within their shelter'd dell. Near to the choral band, embower'd and hid From rapine, hate, and feud's relentless ire; Low in a grassy vale, where, tame, the kid And lambkin dancing play'd, a ruin'd sire Secluded lived. Escaped from whelming fire At midnight's murdering hour, swift, through the roar Of wintry storms, he fled from horrors dire, And with an infant—saved of all his store! To Yarrow's sylvan banks the blooming treasure bore. Here, lonely screen'd, affection urged to save The helpless life dependent on his aid; His sheltering roof, the bank's deep echoing cave; His food, the wild fruits glean'd around the glade!— Heaven, favouring, smiled. A lamb, that wilder'd, stray'd Within the grot, th' experienced sire retain'd, Lured by its bleating cries, fond, undismay'd, The dam swift follow'd, answering as it plain'd, And with her milky store two helpless lives sustain'd. Thus nightly lured, the wintry season past; Returning spring increased the fleecy fold; Contentment soothed, and deaden'd woes at last, While years untroubled came, and passing roll'd: The stripling grew; the sire, though frail and old, Beheld, with cheering hope, his shepherd boy Secured from want. Each eve the warrior told The tales of former happiness and joy, And all the woes of feud, that ruin and destroy! And oft, to cheat and cheer the lingering hour, The hoary sage would wake the legend strain; Recount the marvellous deeds of martial power, And paint the tumult of th' embattled plain; Yet, while he sung the carnage of the slain, In sorrow's tone, soft pity's sighs he drew; And checking rising fervour, shew'd how vain The pride of conquest, slaughtering to subdue! Compared with virtue's charms, unchanging—ever new. And oft, I ween! to warm impassion'd youth With all that's courteous, generous, just, and brave, Instructive age would blend with moral truth Romantic feats, when dauntless Knighthood gave Its bright example to reform; and save Unshelter'd virtue from oppression's power; Chastised dishonour; freed the injured slave Of tyrant thrall; attack'd the dragon-bower; Broke beauty's captive spell, and storm'd th' enchanted tower. Touch'd with the subject of the evening's lay, The stripling caught the sorrows that were sung, And wandering, lonely, with his flock by day, Conn'd the sad tales, o'er which he nightly hung; And much he wish'd (unpractised yet and young) In suited strains, emotions to unfold, When from the neighb'ring dell, sweet warbling rung The Muses' varied notes—now soft, now bold, And to his ravish'd ear th' important secret told. 'Twas then arose, united, and refined, The witching strains of Melody and Song! True to each note the charms of verse combined The power of thought, impassion'd—moral—strong; Through wood and vale, re-echoed sweet among The haunts of quiet, soft the warbling rose:— Flocks listening gaze; arrested oft, and long, The bounding roe-buck and his woodland does Turn, captived by the sound harmonious as it flows! Thrill'd with the charm!—enchanted with the art! The fond enthusiast, listening to the choir, Felt the warm flash of genius shoot athwart His ardent brain, and caught th' electric fire; And as he listening heard the changing lyre, Sweet as the Muses sung the Pastoral lay, Now melting soft to passion's warm desire; Now lightly brisk to rural joys and play, Whole nights and summer days past unperceived away! They sung of love, and lover's pains, The Pastoral Songs. Their joys, and softened sorrow; They sung contentment's rural strains Around the “Braes o' Yarrow;” On “Etterick banks” was heard the reed That piped to pastoral leisure, And echoing sweet round winding Tweed Was heard the varying measure; And Teviotdale returned the sound With all its groves embowering, And “Galla water's” green hills crown'd With whins and wild thyme flowering; Blithe were the strains by “Cowden knows” And “Leader's haughs” and river! But sad! where Jed's stream murm'ring flows The blythe notes echoed never! For war with blood stained Jed's sweet shore When love oft wail'd her marrow, And wafted mid the tempest's roar The sound was heard at Yarrow. Sad o'er the lone vales as it swept, And thrill'd the heart with anguish, The Muses changed the lyre, and wept; The Ballad Strains. Love's notes were heard to languish; The rural pipe neglected lay! No sound was heard by night or day But melting “dule and sorrow!” Beside some bank or willow'd stream Soft Pity tuned the mournful theme, And starting, saw in frightful dream Some lover drown'd in Yarrow! But had you seen the Shepherd boy When Song and Music fired his breast, Tune the loved instruments with joy That by the Muses' skill express'd The varied Passions that confess'd The power of Nature's artless sway; You would have sworn the ruin'd mind To reason lost—wild—unconfined Had wing'd its maniac way! Oh! had you seen him as he stray'd, Rapt, through the greenwood's lonely shade, When silence reign'd at even, And heard him pour his varied song Descriptive—moral—melting—strong! Inspired by favouring Heaven, You would have hail'd him as he stood Entranced in fond poetic mood, The genius of the grove; And thought you heard by bank and spring Responsive sweet! the wood-nymphs sing Of rural peace and love! The Muses markt, and raptured smiled, And as they claspt loved Nature's child Delighted to their breast, In tears of joy they blest the morn On which a Shepherd bard was born To charm rude minds to rest. “And take,” they cried, “the pastoral reed That pipes to peace and pleasure, And sing while flocks round Yarrow feed The sweets of rural leisure; Yet midst the charms that song bestows Think of the child of sorrow, Who whelm'd to-night with warfare's woes, Weeps o'er her lot to-morrow! Attune the lyre! but let it sound To every answering dale around The melody of woe! For melody and song assail The frozen heart, when miseries fail To melt th' infuriate foe: Sad let it ring! to Nature free! Unmarr'd by art-trick'd minstrelsy; For art and nature ill agree When passion bursting speaks; While left alone to play her part, Deep-melting sorrow wrings the heart, And oft the heart too, breaks! But when Pleasure's warm sensation Prompts the mirth-inspiring strain, Snatch fond Youth! the blest occasion To light transport up again! Pleasure's joys may flie to-morrow, Hail them while they kindling move! Life was ne'er foredoom'd to sorrow Cheer'd with melody and love! Ever changing—ever fleeting, Life is but an April day, Smiling—frowning—tempting—cheating! Hail its sun-beams while they play. Song and melody can lighten Loads that bend the drooping soul, Gild the gloom of fate, and brighten Regions darkling round the pole; Cheering with their warm intrusion Iceland shivering feels the glow, Lapland, yielding to illusion Smiles amid eternal snow: See Icelandic and Lapland Poetry. Nor freezing blasts from Alpine height Can chill the fervent pleasure; Nor climes where softer charms invite, Obliterate the measure: Where'er he roams, bold, calm, or gay, Re-wake the strain which youth's blithe day Heard round Helvetia's steeps, Tho' nursed in war—to valour bred, The soldier gone!—fame—glory fled, Thinks of his home, and weeps! “There is a dance in Switzerland which the young shepherds perform to a tune played on a sort of bag-pipe. The tune is called Rance des Vaches; it is wild and irregular, but has nothing in its composition that could recommend it to our notice. But the Swiss are so intoxicated with this tune, that if at any time they hear it when abroad in foreign service, they burst into tears; and often fall sick, and even die, of a passionate desire to revisit their native country; for which reason, in some armies where they serve, the playing of this tune is prohibited. This tune having been the attendant of their childhood and early youth, recals to their memory those regions of wild beauty and rude magnificence; those days of liberty and peace; those nights of festivity; those happy assemblies; those tender passions, which formerly endeared to them their country, their homes, and their employments; and which, when compared with the scenes of uproar they are now engaged in, and the servitude they now undergo, awaken such regret as entirely over-powers them.” Beattie on Poetry and Music. O patriot passion! close intwin'd With friendship warm, and love refined, Resistless is thy power! Let wealth with grandeur gild his lot, The wanderer still sighs for his cot, His hill and native bower! And while he sighs, and frequent turns With ardent mind, and breast that burns, To scenes no longer near! Each simple air his mother sung, Placed on her knee when helpless young, Still vibrates on his ear! Strike then the lyre, and raise the song Attuned to joy or sorrow; Oh! pour it melting sweet along The answering banks of Yarrow! Till shepherds listening, catch the strain As flocks are careless roaming, And milk-maids lilt it soft again At ewe-bughts in the gloaming; Till love and friendship on the wing Waft concord to disorder, And teach e'en Rapine's hordes to sing “Peace to the troubled Border!” END QE CANTO THE FIRST. Canto Second. Blest be the song! (a bard, though humble, cries), That moves by Pity's power th' infuriate breast; Lures Mercy beaming from her native skies To soften rage, and shelter the oppress'd; And guide to Peace, where Concord, warm caress'd By friendship, tunes in harmony the string To love and pastime, innocence and rest, As shepherds pipe, and rural poets sing Till cliffs reverberate round, and answering vallies ring! “Smit with the love of song,” by bank and stream The Stripling framed the subject of the lay, And while the loves and virtues warm'd his theme, Nor care nor sorrow cross'd his flowery way; But, when the clang of carnage and affray Assail'd his ear, his throbbing heart would swell; For, reft of all by rapine's savage sway, The houseless wanderer fled from murder's yell, And shivering roam'd the wild, or weeping skulk'd the dell! Ah! what could he, who burn'd to yield relief Without the power to succour, or to save? But tune the lyre to sympathy and grief, And sing the virtues of the fall'n and brave! But weave the partial theme, where pity gave Unblemish'd valour to the warrior slain; Or, strew with flowers of praise the lover's grave, Unbless'd with hallow'd dust, or funeral train, And chaunt each mournful dirge in sorrow's doleful strain! Lured by the sounds, sad floating on the gale, Accordant to the breast of plaintive woe, The neighb'ring shepherds sought the tuneful vale, And melting heard compassion's numbers flow; And as they felt the charm, and wept the blow Of adverse fate, they loved the lay that shed Th' embalming dew of praise on those laid low; For sorrow loves to hear the favourite dead Receive the look'd for meed that cheers death's gloomy bed! Listening they caught the melody of song, While mem'ry held the moral of the lay; And circling wide the pastoral haunts among, Love nightly heard what passion framed by day: For as each songster, save from war's dismay By secret bank and streamlet mused alone, Flowing the numbers came;—now sad—now gay, As warm emotions burst in varied tone To love's enchanting joys, or grief's lamenting moan. Spreading, at length they reach'd the banner'd hall Of plundering chief, and haughty baron bold, Dead'ning the pangs of guilt in festive brawl As round in savage mirth intemperance roll'd; More savage still, the minstrel strains extoll'd The crimes of midnight deeds and horrors fell! When thrilling warm through breasts insensate cold, The moral Muse transfused her magic spell, Waked the lost mind to thought, and struck the Pastoral shell! Sweet is the charm! when round the social board Pure friendship weaves the myrtle with the vine; But sweeter still, when o'er each trembling chord Soft Sympathy awaked by strains divine Steals kindling warm; created to refine, And light th' expanding soul, released and free From sordid lusts, and selfish cares that twine Around th' unfeeling heart, shut out—ah me! From ev'ry sound of woe, love, mirth, or melody! Deep rung the lyre! for dismal was the tale That chronicled the ills of feudal waste! Wild rose the strain! but soft as summer's gale Came Pity wafted to the conscious breast; And while the theme with artless truth impress'd The wants and woes that spring from warfare's spoil, It pointed cheering to the path, where blest With annual plenty, Industry and Toil Smile round their cultured lawns, and rich rewarding soil. It sung of joys—unknown to carnage dread! Of charms, that soothing, gild life's frequent gloom; Content, mild beaming round the peasant's shed, Comforts that cheer, and prospects that illume; Labour unfretful, yielding to the doom That mingles worldly ill with heavenly good; Till resignation, smiling to the tomb, Sheds mellow'd lustre o'er vicissitude Soft as mild Cynthia's rays o'er upland, lake, and wood! It sung of war;—but war unstain'd with crime! It sung of strife;—but strife with glory crown'd; Of spoils—but spoils obtained by feats sublime, Slavery o'erwhelm'd—her captured leaders bound; Banners, high waved to victory's gladd'ning sound Triumphant swell'd to liberty and pride, As from th' insanguined field, and corse-strew'd ground (Changing to blood famed Bannockburn! thy tide) Strode Scotia's patriot sons;—with freedom by their side. But mournful was the strain, and wailing wild The sound of Scotia's loss, and Scotia's woe! When lifeless strew'd, unhonour'd and defiled, On Flowden's field she saw her warriors low. Her “forest flowers” no more in vernal blow! Dazzling the raptured eye as bright they shed Their radiance round, to warm with martial glow Each patriot breast; while waving o'er their head High tower'd the monarch oak in regal grandeur spread. Yet, while in sorrow's tone the numbers roll'd, Plaining and wild to faithless Fortune's frown, Prophetic struck, the Scottish Muse foretold Succeeding days of glory and renown, When link'd in Union, laurell'd wreaths should crown Her valiant sons, and minstrels of the dale, And future bards in powerful accents drown Desponding murmurs, and lamenting wail, And weave on Flodden-Field a Marmion's pictured tale. Rapt in successive visions as they rose, She sung of deeds conceal'd from mortal eye, Of heroes, doom'd oppression to oppose, Bounding o'er waves, to conquer or to die! “On Egypt's shore,” she cried, “shall valour, high Upborne by freedom, guard what freemen prize, With phalanx firm, and dauntless look defy Outnumber'd legions, and inclement skies, Till awed on Maida's plain proud Gallia shrinks and—flies. “A time will come, when roused by treachery's guile, An injured land, determined to be free, Shall turn for aid to Britain's guardian isle, The fostering home of long-nursed Liberty!— Swift at the call, Iberia arm'd, shall see Congenial bands, by valour waved o'er, Rush onward as the shout of victory Rings from Vimeira's heights to Tagus' shore, While distant vales repeat—Braganza reigns once more! “Fame to the brave! (she sung in ardent tone!) Who for their country's safety nobly fall; Revered tho' lost; 'graved on no mouldering stone, Their names still live! adored and loved by all: Unwarp'd by interest, deaf to party brawl, Aroused by danger, warm'd by valour's flame, Pure honour glowing, lists but to the call Of duty's sacred, never-ceasing claim, Till virtue rears the tomb, and 'graves—a Patriot's name! “And fame,” she cried, “shall sound her clarion long For those, who, warm'd by truth, the lyre shall string To peace and concord, wove in deathless song, As love and friendship sail on downy wing:— And such shall come!—I see by bank and spring Deckt in their rosy wreaths, the tuneful train! My Ednam bard, Thomson. by Nature woo'd to sing Her unmark'd beauties in unrivall'd strain; My moral minstrel bold; Beattie. my heav'n-taught rustic swain! Burns. “And thee! my pastoral warbler, Ramsay. in whose lays My airs, revived, shall ring round burn and knowe, Blithe as the “Gentle Shepherd” piping strays O'er Pentland's height, or sings in “Habbie's How;” But chief my songstress! Joanna Baillie. on whose modest brow I see the tragic muse the chaplet bind, Fresh as when cull'd from Avon's mulberry bough And meads bright varied as her Shakespeare's mind, Th' unfading wreath she wove, and round his temples twined!” More had she sung;—but mindful of the lot Of measured life, she droopt, and heaved a sigh, Condemn'd her pride, and turning to each spot Where mute one day each tuneful bard would lie Her sorrows flow'd!—yet while they dimm'd her eye, Re-cheer'd she saw, bright thro' the gathering gloom, A favourite's blossom'd grave in vernal dye, Where new-blown roses, fresh in annual bloom, Bedeck'd the wintry turf that wrapt her aged Home. John Home, the celebrated author of Douglas, who seems to have dropt in the grave unnoticed and forgot!! Touch'd with her praise, and emulous of fame, (Dear to the heart that owns poetic charms!) The Shepherds listening, felt ambition's flame, Guiltless of aught that fires to slaughtering arms: Peace lent the glow;—oppress'd with wild alarms, And stung with crimes that rent the mourner's breast, Each strove to light the genial flame that warms To social joy, when love smiles war to rest, Unbinds the scaring helm, and hides the blood-dyed crest. And first, to wake Compassion, dead In breasts long torn asunder With ranc'rous hate, and carnage dread Mid uproar, rage, and plunder, They tuned the chord to misery's moan, A wild, disorder'd, melting tone! Which grief alone can swell, And joining numbers, sadly true, In artless strains described, what few Skill'd bards can paint so well. Urged by the Muse, who never speaks To feeling breasts in vain, The shepherds touch'd the string that wakes To Penitence and Pain; And as the Ballad lay they sung, And o'er the lyre impressive hung With sighs responsive deep; Each mournful tale resistless drew The drops of Pity's heavenly dew From eyes unused to weep!— Wild rose the Passions free Bursting in sorrow! Sad was each melody Wafted round Yarrow! Deep, deep! the tragic lay Fram'd to feud's deadly fray, Pouring Love's welladay! O'er murder'd marrow!— Changed are the notes of cheerless woe, The strains of sorrow cease; A softer theme is heard to flow, The heav'n-tuned song of Peace! When Pity moves the ruthless breast, Like Love's star glittering in the west Peace gilds the lurid gloom, A rosy dawn succeeds the night, A cheering sun beams radiant bright, All nature breathes perfume! O Thou! with olive garland crown'd, Meek shelt'rer of despair! Sweet Sympathy! with robe unbound And throbbing bosom bare! How oft, when fury lights the eye, And dark revenge broods threat'ning nigh, Thy angel form appears Gliding amid the dismal gloom, To lull the storm, and soft illume With sun-beams glanced thro' tears! Then springs the soul to raptures new, Unfelt by murder's slaught'ring crew, Till touch'd with pity's smart, Mild Mercy then resumes her tone, And Friendship smiling on his throne, Clasps Concord to his heart! For touch the soul with soft delight That flows from guiltless pleasure, Swift, kindred charms with smiles invite To Love and social leisure; Compared with strife, new pictures rise To strike, astonish, and entice From crimes, that blackening scare! Till shudd'ring at each horror past, The ruffian turns to Heaven at last With penitence and pray'r. Nor ceas'd the band, till sprightly sweet The Pastoral strains arose In cadence brisk, and numbers meet, Care's murmurs to compose; Each songster warbling, trill'd the wires That rung to Pleasure's chaste desires By streamlet, bank, and grove, And echoing round the cheerless dome Of gloomy Discord's hostile home Breath'd Harmony and Love! From southern Cheviot's war-stain'd hills To broom-flower'd Pentland's heights and rills, No other tales were told But milk-maids lilting at their pail, And shepherds piping in the dale, Or wooing at the fold: Sweet were the sounds by stream and glade As pastimes echoed in the shade While flocks and herds were roaming! But sweeter still, the trysted hour When lovers met in secret bower Or ewe-bughts in the gloaming! But when they sung how love beguiled Each dark, ungentle passion; How Nature woo'd, and sigh'd, and smiled, And jeer'd in am'rous fashion; A warmer strain was heard to ring From every sweet accordant string To harmonize disorder, Till far and near the swelling sound Was heard the answering hills around, “Peace to the troubled Border!” Moved with the shepherds' artless lays, War smooth'd his rugged feature; A softening murmur whisper'd praise, Waked by the strains of nature; The youthful warior felt love's flame, The plund'rer, blushing deep with shame, Forgot his purpose dire; And deeper still, the Minstrel crew Blush'd, conscience struck!—in haste withdrew, And dropt the Border Lyre. The songsters smiling, raptured saw The power of nature's sovereign law, And blest the pastoral strain; And as they swept with willing hand The sounding chords, around the land The Virtues bloom'd again; And as they bloom'd, they odours shed Rich o'er the wild, where Mercy led Her train to social rest, And Peace, long doom'd by strife to roam, Call'd love and friendship to her home, And nursed them at her breast. Among the band that softened rage, Was one, whose skill and reverend age Attracted notice due; For, as he struck his Doric lyre, His sparkling eye shot youthful fire, As rapt, his numbers flew; Prepared to sound a warning call At once to soften and appal The turbulence of feud, He tuned his voice to sorrow's wail, And bending to his mournful tale, Thus sung in pensive mood. END OF CANTO THE SECOND. Canto Third. DORNOCK HA'. A BALLAD. The night blew cauld thro' snaw and sleet, Loud rair'd the blast wi' deaf'ning din; A voice cam' sad, yet mournfu' sweet; “Unbar the door, and let me in! On feckless eild, wi' waes down borne, Bereft o' hame, friends, kith or kin, Some pity tak'!—till cheering morn Unbar the door!—Oh let me in!” To feckless eild, or sorrow's mane My door was aye unbarr'd and free, Come in auld man!—tho' left alane, The friends o' pity here ye'll see: Come in auld man! our house, tho' sma', Has aye a nook for want and wae; There's shelter here frae wind and snaw, And kindness too, for night and day. We led him to our cozie nook; His cheek was wan—his strength was gane! My Grizzie cast saft pity's look, As frae her heart burst sorrow's mane; She brought the best things frae her hoard, The bicker ream'd wi' nappy brown, And smiles o' kindness round the board Made welcome's feast gang sweeter down. Cheer'd wi' my Grizzie's kindly treat, The carle's heart began to glow; Our wee-things crap around his seat, Our ingle bleez'd a canty low; Aft times he sigh'd, and sometimes smil'd, Then shook his head as white as snaw; And aft a thought his peace beguil'd, Whan down a tear wad trickling fa'! “Blissfu' the lot!” at length he cries, “When kindred virtues mingle round; Unbind the cords that misery ties, And pour their balm in sorrow's wound!— 'Twas sae alas! when plenty shed Her heart'ning joys within my ha'; Ilk strave to mak' the mourner glad, And dry the tears that grief let fa'! The cauldest night snell winter blaws Could warm the freezing heart o' care; Skreen'd safe within my sheltering wa's, Smiles bright'ning brak' through mirk despair; The feast, the sang, the tale gae'd round To cheat the pang that sorrow gae, And aye wi' cheering, saftening sound I waked to mirth the minstrel lay!” What brak the joys that plenty shed?— What banish'd safety frae your ha'?— Was't poortith, aye in sorrow clad, That sent ye mourning thro' the snaw? “It was na poortith wrought the change; It was na want owrturn'd my ha'; 'Twas deadly feud, and black revenge Sent frail fourscore thro' blast and snaw! Ae fearfu' night—(oh! night of fate!) Loud beat the storm wi' thund'ring thud, The waters raise, and in a spate Updash'd in foam the neighb'ring flood; A cry o' horror through the blast Reach'd where my family quak'd wi' fear; Starting I raise in wilder'd haste, And frae the wa' upsnatch'd my spear; “Oh gang na forth! my Marian cried, As fast she held me to her breast, The rain has swell'd the raging tide— Oh gang na forth!” she sigh'd and prest. “A horseman rides the roaring flood Loud cried our warden frae the tower, He's miss'd the ford at Dornock wood, Nor horse, nor man, will reach the shore!” Fearless I flew whar danger led, The horse was gane; the rider seen Struggling for life in death's deep bed, Dash'd round in Kirtle's whirling linn!— Oh! had the life that then remain'd Sunk in the flood I desp'rate braved, What ills and waes that since hae pain'd This bleeding heart had then been saved! Senseless and pale we bare him hame; My Helen fair, prepared his bed! We waked ere lang life's smother'd flame; My Marian kind, band up his head! Three weeks we cherish'd in our ha' This fause Earl's son o' high degree, The fourth, the traitor stal awa' A treasure rich, and dear to me! The lily pure that decks the vale Fresh gilt wi' morning's beams and dew, The rose that blushing scents the gale, Wi' Helen match'd would tyne their hue!— Ah me! e'en now, cheer'd in this nook, Wi' thae sweet young things round my chair, Methinks I see her artless look;— Sae ance she smiled wha—smiles nae mair!” ‘O waefu' mourner!—yet disclose What cam o' Helen stown awa'?’ “Our Warder brought the tale o' woes Loud echoing thro' my sorrowing ha'— Bowne!—bowne!—to horse! I raging cried, To horse! my gallant friends and true, Ere night I guess, if swift we ride, The traitor thief the deed shall rue! Lang, lang I sought my darling child, (The gem was hid in secret bowers.) At length 'mang glens, and forests wild, We spied the raver's castled towers:” ‘I come to warn ye o' your fate,’ Outspak a herald loud and bauld, ‘Nae careless watchmen guard yon gate, Nae worn-out warriors frail and auld; Full fifty spearmen, stoops o' weir, Guard round;—their leader bad me say, Come to your Helen kind and fair, The bridal feast shall crown the day.’ “Gae, tell your fause and taunting lord To keep his feasts for them wha crave!— I cam na here to grace his board, His life, or her he's stown I'll have! His fifty warriors let him guide, Wi' thirty leil I'll meet him here; Justice and heaven are on our side, The base alane hae cause to fear! The bugles rang thro' glen and wood; Our spearmen fought wi' might and main; I sought fause Guy—he fell in blood;— My faithfu', valiant friends war slain!” My Grizzie's colour fled, and came, Her heaving sighs fast rise, and fa'; ‘Speak! is na Gregory your name, The Baron ance o' Dornock Ha'?’ “What boots it what I ance possest! My name, my lineage wherefore tell!— They've lang lain buried in this breast, In flames o' fire my family fell!— Oh barb'rous deed! to smother life Guiltless o' harm—to virtue true!— Inhuman fiends! I brunt nae wife, Nor blooming babes that round ye grew; I cam na at the dead o' night Wi' fire to flame your ancient ha', Drive frailty's eild to winter's blight, And send it mourning thro' the snaw!— What boots it what I ance possest! My birth I've lang conceal'd in shame, A wand'rer houseless, and distress'd, Could ill bruik Dornock's baron'd name!” His streaming griefs my Grizzie sees, She sprang like light'ning frae her seat, Cried, while she claspt the mourner's knees, ‘Your Helen's daughter's at your feet!’ “My Helen's daughter!” skreech'd he wild, As sair wi' warring thoughts he strave;— “Rise—rise! nor mock my helpless eild;— My Helen's lang syne in her grave!” ‘Lang, lang I ken!—and weel I might! Her death has lang been mourn'd by me; But maist o' what ye've tauld this night I've heard upon my mither's knee; Aft, aft in sorrow's waefu' mood When winter's nights blew drifts o' snaw, She'd tell of Guy's red field o' blood, And a' the waes o' Dornock Ha'! And aft (when driven frae house and hame By Guy's rough sire, wha nought could move.) She'd talk o' Gregory's ancient fame, And weep his death in tears o' love! Till worn wi' grief and mirk despair She died! and left her child forlorn, Till Kenneth's love, and tender care Dried up the tears that now return:— But blest the night that blew the blast And sent ye wandering thro' the snaw To find a kindred hame at last To cheat the waes o' Dornock Ha'!’ 'Twas thus, I ween! in times of old The Lyric Muse impassion'd told In simple, varied strain, Her melting tales to touch the heart With sympathy, and warm impart Affliction's woes and pain: And as she sung her moving theme By broomy bank, and limpid stream, The Passions, ever true To Pity's tones, resumed their sway, Long check'd by war, and feudal fray, And strong, and stronger grew; And as they swell'd, and throbbing beat, Fond from their rural hid retreat The Loves came smiling by, And joining Friendship, hand in hand Danced raptured round in choral band To Peace and Harmony! Each softening virtue claim'd a place, Warm Charity with angel face, Compassion, heavenly meek! And Modesty, in blushing traits, Scarce seen in these new-fashion'd days To deck youth's virgin cheek! Blest be the song! and blest the lyre! That warm the soul with passion's fire, Again a poet cries; Lure Peace and Concord, to assuage With lenient balm infuriate rage, And Mercy from the skies! For till they join, by Virtue twined, Discord and Warfare crush the mind, While Ruin sweeps along; Nor Love, nor Harmony divine Bend, wooing from their radiant shrine To prompt the poet's song. THE END.</field>
