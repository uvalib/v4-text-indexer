      <field name="fulltext">Non est rectum, quod Ã  Deo non est directum. To her louing sonne Bernye Grymeston. [Crush the serpent in the head] Crush the serpent in the head, Breake ill egges yer they be hatched. Kill bad chickens in the tread, Fledge they hardly can be catched. In the rifling stifle ill, Lest it grow against thy will. [As a false Louer that thicke snares hath laied] As a false Louer that thicke snares hath laied, T'intrap the honour of a faire yoong maid, When she (though little) listning eare affoords To his sweet, courting, deepe affected words, Feeles some asswaging of his freezing flame, And sooths himselfe with hope to gain his game, And rapt with ioy, vpon this point persists, That parleing citie neuer long resists: Euen so the serpent that doth counterfet A guilefull call t'allure vs to his net, Perceiuing vs his flattering gloze disgest, He prosecutes, and iocund doth not rest, Till he haue tri'd foot, hand, and head, and all, Vpon the breach of this new battered wall. Simon Grahame to the Authour. Goe famous thou, with euer flying fame, That mak'st thy flight on Vertues wings to sore, In worlds of hearts goe labyrinth thy name, That wonders selfe may wondrous thee adore. Though th' authours selfe triumph in heauenly glore, Thou sacred worke giu'st mortall life againe; And so thy worth hath made her euermore In heauen and earth for euer to remaine. Hir pondrous speech, hir passion and hir paine, Hir pleasing stile shall be admir'd ilke where. The fruitfull flowing of hir loftie braine Doth now bewray a mothers matchlesse care, While she liues crown'd amongst the high diuines, Thou on hir sonne celestiall sunne downe shines. MISCELANEA The verse has been extracted from prose text. CHAP. II. A mortified mans melancholy expressed in the person of Heraclitus, who alwaies wept. [A dolefull case desires a dolefull song] A dolefull case desires a dolefull song Without vaine Art or curious complement; And squallid fortune into basenesse flung Doth scorne the pride of woonted ornament. [A wretched world, the den of wretchednesse.] A wretched world, the den of wretchednesse. Deform'd with filth and foule iniquitie, A wretched world, the house of heauinesse, Fild with the wreaks of mortall miserie. O wretched world, and all that is therein, The vassals of Gods wrath, and slaues to sinne. [Which did in former time Gods image beare?] Which did in former time Gods image beare? And was at first, faire, good, and spotlesse pure. But since with sinnes hir beauties blotted weare, Doth of all sights hir owne sight least indure. [Since haruest neuer failes, but euer must] Since haruest neuer failes, but euer must, Be torturd with the racke of his owne frame: For he that holds no faith, shall finde no trust, But sowing wrong, is sure to reape Gods blame. [For when the soule findes here no true content] For when the soule findes here no true content, And like Noahs Doue can no sure footing take: She doth returne from whence she first was sent, And flies to him that first hir wings did make. CHAP. III. A Patheticall speech of the person of Diues in the torments of hell. [Like as the sacred oxe that carelesse stands] Like as the sacred oxe that carelesse stands, With gilded hornes, and flowrie garlands crownd, Proud of his dying honour and deare bands, Whilst theaters fume with frankensence around: All suddenly with mortall blow astond, Doth groueling fall, and with his steeming gore, Distaine the pillars and the holy ground, And the faire flowers that decked him afore, So downe I fell on wordlesse precious shore. [Vnder whose feet, subiected to his grace] Vnder whose feet, subiected to his grace, Sat Nature, Fortune, Motion, Tyme and Place. [A deadly gulfe where nought but rubbish growes] A deadly gulfe where nought but rubbish growes, Which vp in th' aire such stinking vapour throwes, That ouer there may flie no bird but dies, Chok't with the pestilent sauours that arise. [Your fond preferments are but childrens toyes.] Your fond preferments are but childrens toyes. And as a shadow all your pleasures passe. As yeeres increase, so wauing are your ioyes. Your blesse is brittle, like a broken glasse, Or as a tale of that which neuer was. [What in this life we haue or can desire] What in this life we haue or can desire, Hath time of growth, and moment of retire. So feeble is mans state as sure it will not stand, Till it disordered be from earthly band. [Let euery one do all the good he can] Let euery one do all the good he can: For neuer commeth ill of doing well. Though iust reward it wants here now and than, Yet shame and euill death it doth expell. Wretched is he that thinks by doing ill, His euill deeds long to conceale and hide: For though the voice and tongues of men be still, By fowles and beasts his sin shalbe descride. And God oft worketh by his secret will, That sinne it selfe the sinner so doth guide, That of his owne accord, without request, He makes his wicked doings manifest. Shame followes sinne neuer so closely done: Shame alwayes ends, what wickenesse begun. [God is best when soonest wrought] God is best when soonest wrought, Lingring thoughts do come to nought. O suffer not delay to steale the treasure of that day, Whose smallest minute lost, no riches render may. CHAP. IIII. Who liues most honestly, will die most willingly. [For what's the life of man, but euen a tragedie] For what's the life of man, but euen a tragedie, Full of sad sighes, and sore catastrophes? First comming to the world with weeping eye, Where all his dayes like dolorous trophes, Are heapt with spoiles of fortune and of feare. [Our frailties dome, is written in the flowers] Our frailties dome, is written in the flowers, Which flourish now, but fade yer many howers. By deaths permission th' aged linger heere, Straight after death, is due the fatall beere. [Death is the salue that ceaseth all annoy.] Death is the salue that ceaseth all annoy. Death is the port by which we passe to ioy. [Life is a bubble blowen vp with a breath] Life is a bubble blowen vp with a breath, Whose wit is weaknesse, and whose wage is death, Whose way is wildnesse, and whose inne is penance, Stooping to crooked age the host of grieuance. [O who would liue, so many deaths to trie] O who would liue, so many deaths to trie, Where will doth wish that wisedome doth reproue, Where nature craues that grace must needs denie, Where sence doth like, that reason can not loue, Where best in shew in finall proofe is worst, Where pleasures vpshot is to die accurst? CHAP. V. Speculum vitÃ¦. A sinners glasse. [The sinne that conquers grace by wicked vre] The sinne that conquers grace by wicked vre, So soyles our soules as they can haue no cure. CHAP VI. The union of Mercy and Iustice. [O who shall shew the countenance and gestures] O who shall shew the countenance and gestures, Of Mercie and Iustice, which faire sacred sisters With equall poize doe euer ballance euen, Th'vnchaunging proiects of the king of heauen? Th'one sterne of looke, th'other milde aspecting, Th'one pleasd with teares, th'other blood affecting. Th'one beares the sword of vengeance vnrelenting, Th'other brings pardon for the true repenting. [For hope of helpe still comfort giues] For hope of helpe still comfort giues, While Mercy still with Iustice liues. CHAP. VII. Ingum meum suaue. [If ought can touch vs ought, afflictions lookes] If ought can touch vs ought, afflictions lookes Makes vs to looke into our selues so neere, Teach vs to know our selues beyond all bookes, Or all the learned schooles that euer were. This makes our senses quicke, and reason cleare, Resolues our will, and rectifies our thoughts, So doe the windes and thunder clense the aire, So lopt and pruned trees do flourish faire. CHAP. X. A theme to think on. [This soul's a substance and a reall thing] This soul's a substance and a reall thing, Which hath it selfe an actuall worke in night, But neither from the senses power doth spring, Nor from the bodies humours tempered right: It God himselfe doth in the bodie make, And man from this the name of man doth take. [He that preferres not God fore all his race] He that preferres not God fore all his race, Amongst the sonnes of God deserues no place. CHAP. XI. Morning Meditation, with sixteene sobs of a sorowfull spirit, which she used for ment all prayer, as also an addition of sixteene staues of uerse taken out of Peters complaint; which she usually sung and played on the winde instrument. [A sorie wight the obiect of disgrace] A sorie wight the obiect of disgrace, The monument of feare, the map of shame, The mirror of mishap, the staine of place, The scorne of time, the infamie of fame, An excrement of earth to heauen hatefull, Iniurious to man, to God vngratefull. [Sad subiect of my sinne hath stor'd my minde] Sad subiect of my sinne hath stor'd my minde, With euerlasting matter of complaint: My throwes an endlesse alphabet doe finde, Beyond the pangues that Ieremie doth paint. That eies with errors may iust measure keepe: Most teares I wish that haue most cause to weepe. [Giue vent vnto the vapors of my brest] Giue vent vnto the vapors of my brest, That thicken in the brims of cloudy eies, Where sin was hatch't let teares now wash the nest. Where life was lost, recouer life with cryes: My trespas foule, let not my teares be few: Baptise my spotted soule in weeping dew, [For gripes in all my parts doe neuer faile] For gripes in all my parts doe neuer faile: Whose onely league, is now in bartring paines: What I engrosse, they traffique by retaile: Making each others miserie their gaines: All bound for euer prentices to care, Whilst I in shop of shame trade sorrowes ware. [My guiltie eie still seemes to see my sinne] My guiltie eie still seemes to see my sinne: All things characters are to spell my fall. What eie doth read without heart rues within: What heart doth rue to pensiue thought is gall, Which when my thought would by my tongue digest, My eares conuey it backe into my brest. [For lif's a maze of countlesse straying waies] For lif's a maze of countlesse straying waies: Open to erring steps, and strowed with baits: To winde weake senses into endlesse straies, A loofe from vertues rough vnbeaten straits, A flower, a play, a blast, a shade, a dreame, A liuing death, a neuer turning streame. [Else weeping eies resigne your teares to me] Else weeping eies resigne your teares to me, A sea will scantly rinse my ordur'd soule. Huge horrors in high tides must drowned be. Of euery teare my crime exacteth toule. My staines are deepe: few drops take out none such, Euen salue with sore, and most is not too much. [Lest shame the liuery of offending mind] Lest shame the liuery of offending mind, The vgly shroud that ouer shadoweth blame, The mulct at which foule faults are iustly fin'd, The dampe of sinne, the common sluce of fame, By which impostum'd tongues their humors purge, Doe light on me: for I deserue thy scurge. [For fawning vipers, dumbe till they had wounded] For fawning vipers, dumbe till they had wounded, With many mouthes do now vpbraid my harmes: My sight was vail'd, till I my selfe confounded, But now I see the disinchanted charmes, Now can I cut th' anatomic of sinne, And search with Linxes eyes what lies within. [O beames of mercy beat on sorrowes cold] O beames of mercy beat on sorrowes cold, Powre suppling shewers on my parched ground, Bring foorth the fruit of your due seruice vow'd, Let good desires with like deserts be crownd, Water yongue blooming vertues tender flowre, Sin did all grace of riper growth deuoure. [If Dauid night by night did bathe his bed] If Dauid night by night did bathe his bed, Esteeming longest dayes too short to mone: Inconsolable teares if Anna shed, Who in hir sonne hir solace had forgone: Then I to dayes, to months, to weeks, to yeeres, Do owe the hourely rent of stintlesse teares. [Christ health of feuer'd soule, heauen of the mind] Christ health of feuer'd soule, heauen of the mind, Force of the feeble, nurse of infant loues, Guide to the wandring foot, light to the blind, Whom weeping winnes, repentant sorow moues, Father in care, mother in tender hart, Reuiue and saue me slaine with sinfull dart. [Latar at pities gate I vlcered lie] Latar at pities gate I vlcered lie, Crauing the refuse crummes of childrens plate. My sores I lay in view to mercies eye: My rags beare witnesse of my poore estate. The wormes of conscience that within me swarme, Proue that my plaints are lesse than is my harme, [Prone lookes, crost armes, bent knee, and contrite heart] Prone lookes, crost armes, bent knee, and contrite heart, Deepe sighs, thicke sobs, dew'd eies, and prostrate praiers, Most humbly begge release of earned smart, And sauing shrowd in mercies sweet repaires: If Iustice should my wrongs with rigor wage, Feares would dispaires, ruth breed a hopelesse rage. [With mildnesse Iesu measure my offence] With mildnesse Iesu measure my offence, Let true remorse thy due reuenge abate, Let teares appease when trespasse doth incense, Let pittie temper thy deserued hate, Let grace forgiue, let loue forget my fall: With feare I craue, in hope I humblie call. [Redeeme my lapse with ransome of thy loue] Redeeme my lapse with ransome of thy loue, Trauers th'inditement, rigors doome suspend, Let frailtie fauour; sorrow succour moue. Be thou thy selfe, though changeling I offend, Tender my suite, clense this defiled den, Cancell my debts, sweet Iesu say Amen. CHAP. XII. A Madrigall made by Berny Grymeston vpon the conceit of his mothers play to the former ditties. How many pipes, as many sounds Do still impart to your sonnes hart As many deadly wounds. How many strokes, as many stounds, Ech stroke a dart, ech stound a smart, Poore Captiue me confounds. And yet how oft the strokes of sounding keyes hath slaine, As oft the looks of your kind eies restores my life againe. CHAP. XIII. Euening Meditation. Odes in imitation of the seuen pÅnitentiall Psalmes, in seuen seuerall kinde of verse. Domine exaudi orationem meam. Vouchsafe admit thy gracious eares, With milde regard for to attend The prayers, that a plaining heart With sorowing sighs to thee doth send: And let thereto, Ã´ louing Lord, Thy Iustice and thy Trueth accord. In rigour of thy righteous doome, O do not scan thy seruants cause: For there is none on earth aliue, Through faultlesse life freed from thy lawes. Then how may I in sinfull plight, Seeme iust in thy all-seeing sight! The friend of sinne, the foe of soules, Downe to the earth my soule hath brought, Which to the heauen should aspire, Since from the heauen it was wrought: O raise it vp againe to blisse, From earth and all that earthly is. Amids the darke misse-led am I, Where lacke of light sinnes view denies: I liue a life more like to death, While dead from grace my bodie lies, And where as care through secret smart Sends anguish to afflict my hart. But I (Ã´ Lord) recall to minde What thou hast done in time before, And how thy Iustice hath beene great, But how thy Mercy hath beene more. Thus hope of helpe still comfort giues, While Mercie still with Iustice liues. My stretched hands to thee display The ensignes of my yeelding hart: My soule, as earth that water wants, Of vertues fruit can beare no part. I faint, send some reliefe of raine, Lest els vnfruitfull I remaine. Thy face of pitie, not of wrath, Turne not, Ã´ louing Lord, from me: And let not, Lord, my owne misdeeds Haue lasting force to anger thee: For so might I compare my case To theirs that furthest fall from grace. But since my hope is firme in thee, Let me betimes thy mercie haue, The way of health make knowen to me, My feet from erring paths to saue. Onely to thee my soule retires: Onely thy mercie it desires. O free me from my sinfull foes, To thee I flie to be secure, Teach me the lesson of thy will, And let me put it well in vre. Thou art my God, and God of all That for thy aide and comfort call. Thou wilt vouchsafe to me, Ã´ Lord, Thy Holy Spirit to be my guide, My faith and hope in thee is such, And such it euer shall abide. Reuiue thou wilt me for thy name: Goodnesse in thee requires the same. So that at last by thee, Ã´ God, My soule from bale to blis be brought; And that in mercie thou subuert All those my soules destruction sought: And force of foes destroyd may be, And I made safe for seruing thee. All glory be to thee, Ã´ God The Father of eternall might, And to the Sonne and Holy ghost, Three man vndiuided plight, As now it is, and was of yore, And shall endure for euermore. De profundis clamaui ad te Domine. Even from the depth of woes, Wherein my soule remaines, To thee in supreme blisse, O Lord, that highest raignes, I do both call and crie. It's deepe heart sorowes force, That moues me thus to waile: It's pity Lord in thee, Must make it to auaile. Thine eares therefore applie. If strictly thou, Ã´ Lord, Obserued hast my sinne, Alas, what shall I do? What case them am I in, If rigour thou extend? But well, Ã´ Lord, I know Sweet Mercy dwels with thee: And with thy Iustice then It must expected be: And I therefore attend. My soule doth wait on thee, Thy grace confirms my trust, My warrant is thy word, Thou keepest promise iust: Keepe me, Ã´ Lord, secure. Let thy afflicted flocke Comfort in thee retaine, From dawning day to night, From night to day againe Let still their hope endure. There is with our good God Much mercy still in store. Redemption doth remaine With him for euermore. Abundant is his grace. His people he afflicts He will not leaue distrest, The thralled he will free With ease of their vnrest, And all their faults deface. All glory be therefore, O Father, vnto thee, And so vnto the Sonne The like great glory be, And to the Holy Ghost, Such as it woonted was Before the world beganne, Such as now yet it is, And euer shall remaine, Aboue all glory most. Domine exaudi orationem meam. O let, Ã´ Lord, thine eares enclined be To heare the praiers that I make to thee: And my hearts griefe that breaketh foorth in cries, O let it haue the power to pierce the skies. Turne not from me thy fauourable face, What day or houre I am in heauie case: But when I call to thee in my distresse, O heare me, Lord, and send me soone redresse. My daies and yeares, alas with little gaine, Like vnto smoke, how are they past in vaine! My forces, Lord, how are they parch't and dry! Deuotions lacke yeelds moisture no supply. The blasted grasse my image now can show, My withered heart confirmes that it is so, And I forgotten haue, vnto my griefe, To eate the bread of my soules best reliefe. And my too much regard of earthly care, Before my selfe for grace I could prepare, Made reason to abandon reason quite, And to affliction fast it selfe vnite. But now, Ã´ Lord, since that I now beginne To see my selfe, and know the shame of sinne; From earthly traine I will retire my minde, Thee will I seeke my sauing health to finde. In desert like as liues the Pelicane, Or as the Crowe that doth day light refraine, Or chirping Sparrow sitting all alone, I shrowd, I watch, retir'd I make my mone. But while, O Lord, I doe endure this life, Expecting peace, by fleeing worldly strife, Old friends I finde become new noisome foes, O loue me Lord, for losse of loue of those. My penance not restraind through scorne of these, My foode I take with ashes and with teares, The more I feare lest thou on me shouldst frowne, That canst me raise, and raising cast me downe. My daies decline as doth a shadow passe, And I as haie that whilome was as grasse: But thou from age to age shalt euer be, Then euermore, Ã´ Lord, forget not me. Vouchsafe, Ã´ Lord, in puissance to arise, To raise thy Sion that depressed lies: Now is the time, the time doth now expire, It mercy wants, and mercy doth desire. This glorious worke was first begun by thee: Thy seruants erst were glad the stones to see: And they will grieue with hearts afflicted care, If so the ruines thou dost not repaire. But when, Ã´ Lord, thy works shall shew thy fame, The faithlesse people then shall feare thy name, And earthly kings shall bend their glory downe At thy celestiall glory and renowne. Because thy Church, thy Sion, thou diddest build, Where thou wouldst euer haue thy honor hild, And hast not vnregarded heard the plaint Of faithfull folke, thrald in vntruths restraint. And that no time, remembrance may impaire Of thy mainteined worke and mercy rare: Let people now, for people to ensue, Thy praise record, thy praises to renue. For from high heauen to this low earthly place, From blisse to bale our Lord enclines his face, The groanes to heare, the grieued to release, To free from thrall, to make affliction cease. The more may Sion now sound foorth his fame, Ierusalem his praises may proclaime, Wherein his Church, his people do accord, And where as kings are subiects to their Lord. Who may, O Lord, the datelesse daies relate, That of all ages ouerpasse the date? It's thou to vs hast put appointed space, O stop not me ere halfe I runne my race. These elements by alteration strange Shall changed be, and so remaine in change: But thou, Ã´ Lord, that workst all at thy will, Wast earst the same, the same remaining still. Vouchsafe, Ã´ Lord, their ofspring to preserue, That thee in feare, and faith, and loue do serue, And in thy waies directed to remaine, A lasting life in lasting blis to gaine. Vnto the Father, Sonne and holy Ghost, All praise and glory be ascribed most, As heere before the world begun, And as it now, and euer shall be done. Miserere mei Deus. Haue mercy Ã´ good God on me in greatnesse of thy grace, O let thy mercies manifold my many faults deface. Foule, filthie, lothsome, vgly sinne hath so defiled me, With streames of pittie wash me cleane, else cleane I cannot be. Too well my foule vnclensed crimes Remembrance doe renew, Too plaine in anguish of my heart they stand before my view. To thee alone, Ã´ Lord, to thee these euils I haue done, And in thy presence, woe is me, that ere they were begun. But since thou pardon promisest where hearts true ruth is showne; Shew now thy mercies vnto me, to make thy iustnesse knowne. That such as doe infringe thy grace, be made asham'd, and shent, As rife thy mercies to behold, as sinners to repent. With fauour view my foule defects: in crimes I did beginne: My nature bad, my mother fraile, conceau'd I was in sinne. But since thy selfe effectest truth, and truth it selfe is Thee; I truely hope to haue thy grace from sinne to set me free. Since to the faithfull thou before the secret science gaue, Whereby to know what thou wouldst spend, the sinfull world to saue. Whose heauenly Hyssope sacred drops, shall me besprinckle so, That it my sinne-defiled soule shall wash more white then snow. O when my eares receiue the sound of such my soules release, How do sinne laden limmes reioice, at hearts true ioies encrease! From my misdeeds retyre thy sight, view not so foule a staine, First wipe away my spots impure, then turne thy face againe. A cleane and vndefiled heart, Ã´ God, create in me: Let in me, Lord, of righteousnesse a spirit infused be. From that most glorious face of thine Ã´ cast me not away, Thy holy Ghost vouchsafe, Ã´ God, With me that it may stay. The ioy of thy saluation, Lord, restore to me againe, And with the sprite of graces chiefe, confirme it to remaine. That when at thy most gracious hand my sutes receiued be, The impious I may instruct how they may turne to thee. For when, Ã´ Lord, I am releast from vengeance and from blood, How ioyfull shall I speake of thee, so gracious and so good! Thou, Lord, wilt giue me leaue to speake, and I thy praise will showe: For so thy graces do require thou doest on me bestowe. If thou sinne offrings hadst desired, as wonted were to be, How gladly those for all my illes, I would haue yeelded thee! But thou accepts in sacrifice a sorrowing soule for sinne, Despising not the heart contrite, and humbled minde within. Deale graciously, Ã´ louing Lord, in thy free bounty will With Sion thy deare spouse on earth, and fortifie it still. That so thou mayest thence receiue that soueraigne sacrifice, From altar of all faithfull hearts, deuoutly where it lies. To thee, Ã´ Father, glory be, and glory to the Sonne, And glory to the holy Ghost eternally be done. Domine ne in furore. Amiddes the fury, my deare Lord, rebuke not me, Nor let thy chasticement befall, when wrathfull thou shalt be. Thy arrowes in my selfe I feele already stand, I see, Ã´ Lord, thou fixed hast at me thy ayming hand. Within my selfe (Ã´ woe is me) no health I finde, Through feare and terror of thy face, that seemes to wrath enclinde. My very bones disturbed be, gone is their peace, My owne beholding of my sinnes, doth worke my woes encrease. And as my sinnes surmounting are, I must confesse, So are they mounted on my head, and heauy me oppresse. My crimes forepast and pardoned, like starres remaine, That putrifi'd breake out anewe, because I sinne againe. A wofull wretch am I become, crooked I grow, Each day I waile, and while I liue, I will continue so. My members by illusions led me so restraine, My healthlesse body is vnapt true vertue to retaine. By great affliction I am brought exceeding lowe; Be moued, Lord, through my loud groanes, thy mercies to bestowe. My suites, Ã´ Lord, tend all to thee, thou knowest my case; My plaints and penance, Lord, accept, that so I may haue grace. Within my selfe my silly heart is vexed still, My force is lost, my sight I lacke to see and shun my ill. In my displeasing thee, Ã´ Lord, right well I see, My friends are foes, my life is sought, and force is wrought on me. They wish my ill, and speake my scorne; and when they smile, Their hate admits no time of stay to studie fraud and guile. But I, alas, with patience prest must all forbeare, Like to the dumbe, and seeming deafe, I neither speake nor heare. And for because, Ã´ gracious God, I trust in thee, Thou wilt, I know, my louing Lord, giue eare and aide to me. Let not, O Lord, my foes preuaile, lest they reioyce, Sith scarse my feet I may remoue, but they aduance their voice. Of my misdeeds I am prepar'd to beare the smart: Still is my sinne before my sight, and sorow in my hart. I will reuolue my faults forepast amids my minde, And those I truely will confesse, that I may mercy finde. Hate hath confirm'd on me my foes, in wrong full wise, And still they liue, and do increase, whose enuy neuer dies. They yeeld me ill that gaue them good, and me defie, Because I goodnesse would ensue, from which they seeke to flie. Forsake me not, O Lord my God, in state distrest; Be ready, Lord, to my reliefe, my life in thee doth rest. To Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost all glory be, From former endlesse date to dure to all eternitie. Beati quorum remissÃ¦ sunt. O how much blest may they remaine, That pardon for their guilt obtaine, And whose great ill, and ech offence, Lies hid in contrite penitence! What happy state may he be in, To whom our Lord imputes no sin, Whose conscience doth no guile retaine, That can himselfe beguile againe? I did my sinnes in silence holde, In griefe whereof my bones grew olde: Meane while my dayes in plaints of paine, Without redresse, I spent in vaine. But when, O Lord, thy heauy hand No day or night I could withstand, But that in anguish ouerworne, My conscience prickt as with a thorne: Loe then, O Lord, I did beginne To vtter all my secret sinne, No longer list I ought conceale, But ech in iustice to reueale. Against my selfe, I sayd, will I My wrongs confesse, and faults defie: To thee, O Lord, O Lord to thee, That hast from all absolued me. And since I thus thy mercies finde, Let ech of good and godly minde Approch to thee in happy time, To pray for pardon of his crime. For such as so do sincke in sin, That still they plunged lie therein, Vnable are of thee to gaine What contrite sinners can obtaine. O Lord, my refuge rests in thee, When troubles do enuiron me: O free me then, my freedomes ioy, From such as seeke me to annoy. Great comforts, Lord, I do conceaue, Thou me thy seruant wilt not leaue: But wilt instruct and guide me right, And keepe me euer in thy sight. O ye that carelesse are of grace, Beholde, and see your brutish case, And be not as the horse and mule, That liue deuoid of reasons rule. And thou, O Lord, in mercies rife, Vouchsafe restraine their straying life, With bit and bridle make them stay, That vnto thee will not obey. Since that for those of sinfull trade Full many scourges there be made, Well's him that doth in God repose, Whose mercies may his soule enclose. Be therefore ioyfull in our Lord, All that to righteousnesse accord; Let ech with gladnesse beare his part, That hath a pure and perfect hart. All glory be, O Lord, to thee; And to thy Sonne in like degree, As also to the Holy Ghost Perpetuall and enduring most. Domine ne in furore. VVhen my misdeeds, Ã´ God, may thee to anger mooue, Amids the rigour of thy rage, vouchsafe me not reprooue. Nor when for my offences thy chastisement must be, In thy displeasure, Ã´ deare Lord, let it not light on me. Thy mercies Lord I craue, of strength I am bereft; O salue the sorenesse, that my sinne vpon my bones hath left. My much aggrieued soule, my sorrowes doth abound: How long, O Lord, shall they endure, or comfort be vnfound? O turne thy selfe to me, and rid my soule of paine, Euen for thy mercies which exceed, and euer doe remaine. O hasten thee, O Lord, to saue and set me free: Amongst the dead (to their auaile) there's none can thinke on thee. And in the depth of hell, where there is no redresse, Who is it that will giue thee praise, or vnto thee confesse? My sighings for my sinnes haue past in painfull wise, And I each night will wash my bed with teares of wailing eies. My sight is vext with feare of furie in thy rage, O that my sinnes must be my foes to weare me out in age. Away, away from me, all yee that are vniust: Let him my wofull sound receaue, in whom I put my trust. That I with ioy may say, how to my suites accord, Vouchsafed hath to condiscend my deare and louing Lord. Let shame my foes befall, and vexed let them be, Their owne conuersion, or their shame, Lord, let them quickly see. Glory, Ã´ God to thee, and vnto Christ thy sonne, As also to the holy Ghost, let endlesly by done. FINIS. THE BALLAD, OR; Some Scurrilous Reflections In Verse, On the PROCEEDINGS of the Honourable HOUSE of COMMONS: ANSWERED STANZA by STANZA. WITH THE Memorial, Alias Legion, REPLY'D TO Paragraph by Paragraph. I. Ye True-born Englishmen proceed Our trifling Crimes Detect, Let the Poor Starve, Religion Bleed, The Dutch be damn'd, the French succeed, And all by your Neglect. ANSWER. Ye Slaves who make it your Pretence To seek the Nations Good, And cant, and snarl, and give Offence To Men of Honesty and Sense, As all Dissemblers shou'd. II. Your Actions all the World disgust, The French are only glad, Your Friends your Honesty distrust, And while you think you're Wise and Just, The Nation thinks you mad. ANSWER. Speak Truth for once, and feeely own The Justice of their Cause That never Parliament was known To be more faithful to the Throne, Or made more wholesom Laws. III. Are these the ways your Wisdom takes. To raise our Reputation? To Quarrel at a few Mistakes While France their own Advantage makes, And laughs at all the Nation. ANSWER. If evil Councillors preside, And publick harms propose, The way to humble France's Pride Is certainly to have 'em try'd That we may know our Foes. IV. You are the People who of Old The Nations Troops disbanded, And now you should your Friends uphold, Your Friends and you are bought and sold, As always was intended. ANSWER. When all the Fears of War were pass'd And Peace was dearly gain'd Our Money ran away so fast, We must have sold our selves at last, Had we those Troops maintain'd. V. There's none but Fools in Time to come Will Trust the English Nation; For if they do they know their Doom, That we'll be falling out at Home And baulk their Expectation. ANSWER. However when a Neighbr'ing Shore Demanded promis'd Aid, They sent ten thousand Warriors o're, Keeping the Faith they gave before, And whom they sent they pay'd. VI. You are the Nations Grand Defence Against Illegal Power; And yet against both Law and Sense, And sometimes too without pretence You send Folk to the Tower. ANSWER. And as the Dutys of their Place Were to detect Abuses, Corruption durst not shew its Face, Or Monies spent in any Case In Bribes or evil Uses, VII. Some Lords your Anger have incurr'd For Treaty of Partition, But if you'll take the Nations word, Most People think it was Absurd And empty of Discretion. ANSWER. The Treaty of Partition must Without all Doubt have faults, If we can Lord or Commons trust Who voted Both it was unjust, And spoke the Nations thoughts. VIII. For if that Treaty as 'tis fam'd, Gave part of Spain to Gaul, Why should those Gentlemen be blam'd When you your selves are not asham'd To let 'em take it All? ANSWER. Then how can they be faultless who, Gave Counsel to divide, Or it in any sense be true, That Senators French steps pursue, That take the Austrian side IX. Bribes and ill Practices you found And some few felt your Power, But soon you run your selves aground For had you push'd the Matter round, You all had gone to th' Tower. ANSWER. Shepherd, and the Tooth-drawing Squire Who'd be a Legislator, When Burgesses let out to Hire Would gratify a Knaves desire Know quite another Matter. X. Some Reformation has from you, In vain been long expected, For when you should your Business do, Your private Quarrels you pursue, And the Nation lies neglected. ANSWER. The Rights of those they represent Should ne're be yielded by 'em. And as they Articles have sent, The Peers might hold themselves content, And by known Rules to try 'em. XI. Long has the Kingdom born the weight Of your deficient Funds, That Parliamentary publique cheat. Pray where's the difference of that And Plundering with Dragoons? ANSWER. Long has the Kingdom shewn its Zeal. And been at vast Expences. To forward good of Common-weal And given Money, Hand and Seal, To prove 'twas in its Senses. XII. Are you the People that complain Of Arbitrary Power? Then shew the Nation if you can, Where Kings have been, since Kings began, Such Tyrants as you are. ANSWER. Yet have some Miscreants ta'ne the parts. Of Patriots misguided, And curs'd the Men that had the Hearts To take to those, who studied Arts, That with their Country sided. XIII. When Kings with right and Law dispense, And set up Power despotick, It has been counted Law and Sense To take up Arms against our Prince, And call in aids Exotick. ANSWER. It's thought a Business now of great, And wond'rous Reputation, To ruin us and help the State, While Nobles Sin at any Rate, And Beggar half the Nation. XIV. But you, although your Powers depend On every Plowman's Vote, Beyond the Law that Power extend, To ruin those you should defend, And sell the Power you bought. ANSWER. And as their Priviledge takes Rise From Men of Low Condition, To study ev'ry thwarting Vice, That may bring twelve Pence to a Sice, And hinder Coalition. Is it for this we must be thought, Strange insolent Pretenders, Whilst poor unthinking Lords are caught And vindicate that sorry thought That clears impeach'd Offenders. XV. The King Religion did Commend To you his Law-Explainers, We know not what you may intend, Nor how you should Religion mend, Unless you will your Manners. ANSWER. A Pious King may recommend Good Statutes to Law-givers; But how can Nobles who pretend Religious Matters to befriend, Do good while such Bad Livers? XVI. You are the Nations darling Sons, The Abstract of our Mobb, For City Knights and Wealthy Clowns, Stock Jobbers, Statesmen and Buffoons, You may defie the Globe. ANSWER. It's true the Common's all are Chose, By Common-People's Charters. But every living Creature knows, No Souls are thought such Common Foes, As Coronets and Garters. XVII. Toland insults the Holy Ghost, Brib'd S?r bribes accuses, Good Manners and Religion's lost, The King who was your Lord of Host, The Raskal H?w abuses. ANSWER. S?rs to his Immortal Fame Has heard his Crimes repeated, And naval O?d to his Shame, Has got a Conscientious Name By being false acquitted. XVIII. Your Statesmen G?lle with intent To cultivate with Care, The dignity of Parliament, Plyes closely at the Dancing tent, And manages May-Fair. ANSWER. Bold H?m has utter'd words, Audacious in Committee, And giv'n Affronts to those whose Swords, Were full as sharp as any Lords, And Sentences as witty. XIX. The True-Born Heroes diligence For publique good appears, There he refines his Wit and Sense That the next day in our defence May fill Committee Chairs. ANSWER. Tho' G?lle has been lately bought And Country left for Court, And C?tts to shew he valued nought, That was Unparliamentary thought Attended Lords Report. XX. The limitation of the Crown Is your Immediate care, If your Wise Articles go down, Your Power will be so Lawless grown, 'Tis no matter who's the Heir. ANSWER. If the Succession Bill restrain's All Arbitrary Notions, Had Men, or Gratitude, or Brains, They'd fairly thank 'em for their Pains, And praise such useful Motions. XXI. Did we for this depose our Prince, And Liberty assume, That you should with our Laws dispense, Commit Mankind without Offence, And Govern in his Room? ANSWER. Our Prince has been depos'd for things Of fatal Consequences; But he that this poor inference brings That they who chose one since, are Kings, Must needs be out of's Senses. XXII. You shou'd find out some other word To give the Crowns Accepter, To call him King wou'd be Absurd, For tho' he'll seem to wear the Sword, 'Tis you have got the Scepter. ANSWER. Senates think fit for publick good To bridle Regal Power, And make Kings act as Monarchs shou'd, That spare their Subjects Wealth and Blood, Not those they Rule devour. XXIII. And now your wrath is smoaking hot Against the Kent Petition, No Man alive can tell for what, But telling Truths which pleas'd you not, And taxing your Discretion. ANSWER. If Men of Kent Petitions draw, And idly vote Supplies, Instead of those who make the Law, The Gate House, or some Bedlam Straw, Must serve to make 'em Wise. XXIV. If you those Gentlemen detain By your unbounded Power, 'Tis hop'd you'l never more complain Of Bishops in King James's Reign, Sent blindly to the Tower. ANSWER. The Bishops were close Prisoners made, By reason of their Conscience, But these Impertinents, affraid A War would spoil their Owling Trade, Are shut up for their Nonsence. XXV. A strange Memorial too there came, Your Members to affront, Which told you Truths you dare not Name, And so the Paper scap'd the Flame, Or else it had been burnt. ANSWER. The House had other Fish to fry, When Legions Libel came, Then to sit talking o're a Lye, Which had been punish'd, by the By, Had th' Author sent his Name. XXVI. Some said the Language was severe, And into Passion flew, Some too began to curse and swear, And call'd the Author Mutineer, But all Men said 'twas true. ANSWER. The Language certainly was such As shew'd the Writers breeding, And for Civility kept touch With those, it would defend, the Dutch, That use such rough Proceeding. XXVII. But oh! the Consternation now In which you all appear! 'Tis plain from whence your terrors flew, For had your guilt been less you knew, So would have been your fear. ANSWER. And since such falshoods were giv'n out, By those who wish'd 'em Evil, Twas time for them to look about, And to prevent the Rabble Rout, Since Mob's a very Devil. XXVIII. In Fifteen Articles you're told You have our Rights betray'd, Banter'd the Nation, bought and sold The Liberties you shou'd uphold; No wonder you're afraid. ANSWER. Five Hundred Articles might shew What Malice could devise, But had those Articles been true, And worthy of a Publick view, Their Votes had made 'em Lyes. XXIX. And now to make your selves appear The more Impertinent, A wise Address you do prepare, To have His Majesty take care Rebellion to prevent. ANSWER. Addresses at a time when those They wisely represent, Are threatn'd by the Kingdoms Foes, Who wou'd have Brethren come to Blows, Are needful by Consent. XXX. No doubt His Majesty will please To take your Cause in hand, Besides the work is done with ease, Full Seven thousand Men he has The Nation to defend. ANSWER. His Majesty has taken care To Guard us at their Motion, And where we've Fleets without compare, Seven thousand Men are very fair, When they command the Ocean. XXXI. Our Hundred Thousand Heroes more Do our Train'd Bands compose, If foreign Forces shou'd come o're, Plant them and you upon the Shoar, How bravely you'l oppose. ANSWER. There's no great likelihood appears Of Forreigners Invasion, Since Rook around the Channel steers, And Troops enough to quell those Fears, Are ready on Occasion. XXXII. Then blush ye Senators to see How all Men stand dismay'd, The Nation shou'd so patient be, To bear withal your Villany, And see themselves betray'd. ANSWER. Then blush, vile, murm'ring Scribe at sight Of what you cannot prove, And see whilst you Invectives write, How Senators contemn your spight, And gain the Nations Love. XXXIII. It was our Freedom to defend, That We the People chose you, And We the People do pretend Our power of Choosing may extend To punish and depose you. ANSWER. We Apples cry'd the Horse-Turds, Were nought, but common Dung, So We the People's us'd by you, Who never had perhaps to do With Choosing Right or Wrong. XXXIV. For since in vain our Hopes and Fears, Petitions too are vain, No Remedy but this appears, To pull the House about your Ears, And send you home again. ANSWER. But softly, Friend, 'twixt you and me, This would for Truth be known Shou'd any be so bold, he'd see Their Ear would stand, and such as he, Would probably have none. XXXV. These are the Nations Discontents, The Causes are too true, The Ploughman now his Choice repents, For tho' he values Parliaments, He's out of Love with You. ANSWER. That Ploughman neither must have Wit Or sense of growing Favours, Who does not wish and think it fit, Such Patriots shou'd for ever sit, And perfect their Endeavours. XXXVI. When to be chose with Caps in hand You courted every Voice, You were our Servants at Command By which it seems you understand, Until we made our Choice. ANSWER. If things were rightly understood, You'd be in other Story, And freely own, as Sinners shou'd, They're forced to beg to do us Good, And forward Englands Glory. XXXVII. If that be true, we let you know Upon that very Score, You'd best your present Hours bestow In all the Mischiefs you can do, For we'll ne're choose you more. ANSWER. Scriblers may Write what Scriblers please, And threatning Periods use, But such poor Animals as these Are of such Pennyless Degrees, They have no Right to Chuse.</field>
