      <field name="fulltext">Hope travels on, nor leaves us when we die. Pope.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. THE POET; A POEM. Ingenium cui sit, cui mens divinior, atque os Magna sonaturum, des nominis hujus Honorem. Horace. 1773. Hard is the task the poet's life to scan, So different from the common mode of man: A Proteus he, assuming various shapes, All but the philosophic sage escapes. Conducted now by reason's purest ray, Now driven by passion's unresisted sway: A victim now to agonizing woe, Now raised to raptures such as angels know: Now indolent, now planning some great work; Now dull as Crosby When I wrote this, Crosby was Lord Mayor of London., and now bright as Burke: Weak, vigorous, various, unexampled mind; Thyself a microcosm of human kind! Yet of these strange effects the latent cause We may explore, by tracing nature's laws; Those laws consistent, which to order bind The seeming freaks of matter, and of mind; Which guide the comet darting through the pole, And rein the fervor of the Poet's soul. Is not the ball's velocity of course Just in proportion to the impelling force? Is not the river's current swift, or slow, As watery weight, and slope promote it's flow? Must not a being, then, by nature wrought, To show her power in matter, and in thought, Each light impression thrilling through his frame, Inspired by heaven's most sublimated flame; Must not he quit the common mortal sphere, And take an ardent, and a wide career; Now æther's heights undauntedly explore, And wander now on Styx's dreary shore; Prostrate his mind, and rapt in bliss, by turns, As the man flags, or as the angel burns: By virtue, now, to groves Athenian led, Where Plato's genius hovers o'er his head; A heedless victim, now, to low desire; All nerve his body, and his soul all fire? Hail, mild Philosophy! the province thine, To chase the spectres of the dark Divine! Not to fix errour, but with reason's art, To root the stiff old-woman from the heart. 'Tis to thy calm investigation given To reconcile to man the ways of Heaven; To teach us to subdue the zealot's fire, Nor rashly to detest, nor to admire; Serenely to reject, and to approve, Give vice our pity, virtue all our love; By Bethlehem's candid star our course to steer, Benign to others, to ourselves severe! The pensive bard, even in his boyish days, With witless hand anticipates the bays, Unconscious yet of poetry and praise: Leaves his companions to their trifling play, In childish pastime to protract the day; Feels the sweet charm of contemplation's power, And steals from noise to her sequestered bower. Or by more active instinct urged, he strays Through nature's devious, and romantic ways; Impatient seeks the venerable wood, The rock impending, and the rushing flood: Or woos the musick of a silver stream (The murmuring opiate of the poet's dream) Some stream like Avon's, where young Shakespeare thought, His soul transported while the muses taught; Seizing, even then, the drama's wondrous plan, The varied character of motley man; Now darting down to Pluto's dark abodes, With bolder flight now mixing with the gods; Already borne through earth, sea, air, and sky, All fancy's world expanding to his eye. Thus the susceptible, and artless maid, Novice to love, as yet of men afraid, Warmed by a spark from some young amorous eye, To shades from social haunts is wont to fly; And there she sighs, and weeps, she knows not why. But to his verse maturing years impart A stronger ardour with a chaster art; Genius and judgment happily conspire, And calm design directs impetuous fire. Gay fiction now adorns important truth; He checks the intemperate sallies of his youth; With eye severe the brilliant line surveys, Conscious that poets must not snatch the bays; By the slow critick's hand must fix their fame, And life devote to an immortal name. Whatever objects to mankind are dear Within the sensitive, or mental sphere; To life whatever comforts make us cling, A tenfold pleasure to the Poet bring. Then with what strong impressions must he prove The joys ecstatick of all-powerful love! Of love, whose laws the coldest hearts obey, Who breathes a fervour in Bœotian clay; Bids tenderness from savage natures flow, And makes a miser even his gold forego; Parent and sovereign of the human soul! God of the line and god of either pole! The Poet's love to sense is not confined; It opes the world of fancy to his mind: Love in the gross, the animal degree, Talbot or Broughton feels as well as he: Rude, heavy lumps of vegetative earth, By nature viewed unkindly at their Birth; Meant but by her some vacuum to supply, To eat, and drink, and generate, and die. When Sol descending shoots a milder light, The placid medium 'twixt the day and night; When vernal bloom, and musick cheer each grove, Awaking genius, and awaking love; The Poet, and his nymph sequestered stray, Where magic fancy points the enchanted way. The birds their carols chaunt; the jocund spring Sheds all Arabia from his purple wing: Soft zephyr breathes, with gentle pleasure fraught, Diffusing fragrance, and inspiring thought. With ardent eye the bard surveys the scene, But brighter thinks his fair Arcadian queen: From the creative lustre of her eye, Nature's gay tints receive a livelier dye; The feathered tribe, while she their chorus hears, Not less than Linley's voice enchant his ears; Him, by his Cælia's side, the zephyr greets With softer whispers, and more balmy sweets. All spring's rich gifts the power of beauty share, All nature's charms concenter in the fair. Her look, her step excites poetic flame, And brings fine objects which elude a name: The bliss he feels in this elysian hour, Of deathless verse prepares the future power. Ideas rising on ideas throng; His working bosom teems with embryo-song. Hear this, ye tinsel slaves, misnamed the great, And curse the tedious pageantry of state. Oft with the love of simple nature smit, May I the seat of noise, and folly quit; It's tainted manners, and it's tainted air, And to the calm of rural scenes repair: Oft may I stray through Peckham's winding shades, Sweet haunt of poets, and the tuneful maids; In quest of imagery mount Haly-Hill, Where varied views the eye, and fancy fill; Where commerce, and where agriculture smile, And show the matchless glory of our isle. In clouded majesty there London towers, A striking contrast to Arcadian bowers. Methinks I view it from the lofty stand, The pride of Europe raised in freedom's land; Abode of all that's great, and all that's base, The shame, and honour of the human race. There Thames, of English bards the hallowed theme, Pours his transparent, and majestic stream. On the charmed eye the passing canvass plays, It's bosom gilded with the solar rays: Fair emblem of our wealth's exhaustless vein; Fair emblem of our Empire on the main! Hampstead and Highgate northward close the scene, They front my hill; a world of sweets between! In my mind's eye with joy the heights I see; For Middlesex! my soul exults in thee! Thy sons, at freedom's call, would rouse the land, Should kings aspire to absolute command; Boldly the rights of Englishmen would claim, Would catch a Russel's or a Sydney's flame. There the long slope of Essex we pursue; Another Eden there in Kent we view; The hills of Berks and Hertford we descry, And distant Suffolk mingles with the sky. The blooming plain of Surry stretched below, Bespeaks innoxious life exempt from woe: But ah! too short it's distance is from town; The neighbouring capital infects the clown. Yet though the bliss inspired by nature's charms, The poet's breast with strongest influence warms; He oft exerts imagination's power Without the nymph, and the luxuriant bower; Trusts to his native energy of mind, And soars above the vulgar of mankind; Enjoys existence, wakes the genial strain, When souls inferiour only live to pain; When a dire group of dark ideas meet, The gloomy day, the catchpole, and the fleet. Fancy to him his want of wealth supplies, Brings her gay objects of a thousand dyes: Possessing them he spurns the miser's hoard, The splendid lacquey, the luxurious board; Looks down on ?, whose power is but a bribe, Whose glory, but to rule a venal tribe. Though fortune frowned on Savage from his birth, Rather than doze a torpid son of earth, Proprietor of India's richest mine, I'd be that hapless favourite of the Nine: And on the That I may strongly exemplify the constitution and fortune of the poet, I shall here quote two passages from Johnson's Life of Savage: though, I fear, the energy and harmony of their prose, will eclipse the poetry which they are cited to illustrate. “He lodged as much by accident as he dined, and passed the night sometimes in mean houses, which are set open at night to any casual wanderers; sometimes in cellers, among the riot and filth of the meanest and most profligate of the rabble; and sometimes, when he had no money to support even the expences of these receptacles, walked about the streets till he was weary, and lay down in the summer upon a bulk, or in the winter, with his associates in poverty, AMONG THE ASHES OF A GLASS-HOUSE. “In this manner were passed those days, and those nights, which nature had enabled him to have employed in elevated speculations, useful studies, or pleasing conversation. On a bulk, in a cellar, or in a glass-house, among thieves and beggars, was to be found the author of the wanderer, a man of exalted sentiments, extensive views, and curious observations; the man whose remarks on life might have assisted the statesman, whose ideas of virtue might have enlightened the moralist, whose eloquence might have influenced senates, and whose delicacy might have polished courts.” Life of Savage. ashes of a glass-house laid, But raised to heaven by each Aonian maid, My soul to rapture more than human wrought, By ardent genius, by excursive thought; Strongly inspired, and panting for renown, I would not envy kings the couch of down. Ye happy few, who, in your genial hours, Feel the fine raptures raised by fancy's powers— While great Cervantes, in a Moorish jail, But free in mind, composed his wondrous tale; His wondrous tale, which, with unrivalled art, Informs the head and captivates the heart; Such animation to a fiction gives, That still before our eyes his drama lives; We still see Quixote's person with his name, And fat round Sancho, of proverbial fame; Fired by the fable, like the knight we rave, And long to visit good Don Quixote's name, before he commenced Knight-Errant, was Alonso Quixano; and for his virtues he was called El Bueno, The Good. See the last chapter of Quixote. Quixano's grave— While thus, ye happy few, his ardent soul, Of cruel fortune spurned the dire controul; Maintained the right to chosen spirits given, Soared above misery, and asserted heaven— Was not this luminary happier far Than mortals burnished with a tinsel star? No shocks the bard's propitious hours controul; Onward he presses to his wished-for goal: Fired with the prospect of immortal fame, The heart-felt musick of a poet's name, The world ideal which absorbs the mind, He leaves his weaknesses, and wants behind. The Delian God his hallowed bosom fills, Precluding physical, and moral ills. These are the enjoyments which the poet knows; And these enjoyments balance all his woes. The true, great poet's dignity of soul Scorns to usurp, or bear unjust controul; Warmly a brother-bard's desert befriends, Nor aims, by sordid means, at noble ends: He will not, like an envious bard, exclaim Against a living candidate for fame; Merit it's full applause he will not grudge; In him the author will not warp the judge. Parnassian luminaries, near, and bright, May hurt, for him, a weak, distempered sight; He will not sicken at the genial ray, Nor e'er [Parnell's] “Night-Piece on Death, deserves every praise, and, I should suppose, with very little amendment, might be made to surpass all the Night-Pieces, and Church-Yard Scenes that have since appeared.” Goldsmith's Life of Parnell. prefer a Parnell to a Gray. To find his lays make other bard's aspire, Warms him with generous, not with hostile fire; With eager eye the sacred wreath he views, Withheld from malice, granted to the muse; Conscious of noble powers, he spurns all art, But that which moves, and captivates the heart; Secure in genius, deigns not an appeal To those who gape, and stare, but those who feel; To those who soar, like him, on fancy's wings, To those whose souls revibrate what he sings. But as the different talents of mankind Act, in their just decrees, upon his mind, Too warm to perpetrate deliberate wrong, His soul in union ever with his tongue; A stranger he to jealousy, and fear, Imprudent oft, but never insincere; As, on the few who with the greatest vie, He will not cast a dark, malignant eye; Nor will he prostitute a word of praise On fluent writers of insipid lays: Fears not to brand the selfish, and the vain, Who mix presumptuous, with the tuneful train; By profit rate the judgment of the town, And fancy caprice will confirm renown. But still 'tis fashion Garrick to admire; Yet his, and Shakespeare's powers no more inspire Our dissipated souls with hope or fear, Horror excite, or draw the tender tear. Who like immortal Shakespeare ever wrote? Who ere like Garrick imaged what he thought? Hence the great actor, in our trifling age, Is suffered, is applauded on the stage. The well-earned laurels are allowed to bloom Round Garrick's brow, and Shakespeare's hallowed tomb. Coxcombs and ladies dare not yet condemn The scenes they lounge at with a Dutchman's phlegm. Yet baubles brought from Italy, or France, An eunuch's pipe, a new-imported dance, Draw more attention than the finest play— This was not true. 1809.Heinel from Hamlet bears the palm away. Yet, though through life you meet unequal fate (Life, to great minds, is but a trifling date) From just posterity be sure of praise, And, like Apelles, paint for future days. 'Twas long ere Milton's epic powers were known, And Thomsom, when he rose, but faintly shone. Time gives to poets their meridian day, And clears, at length, their morning's mist away; When honest gratitude, with fancy flowed, Through all a secular, or birth-day ode! But now no Colbert with the brightest fame Adorns a minister's, and monarch's name; Rewards a soft Racine's persuasive art, Draws virtue's tear, and purifies the heart; Bids a Boileau be wholesomely severe, And warms the satirist he needs not fear. No longer now the nine Aonian maids Find hospitable haunts in royal shades: Poets are left to penury a prey, The slaves of trade, the hirelings of the day. Some pert, prim?, or some rougher Turk Prescribes the theme, the measure of the work; Checks the free thought, lops off the ardent word, I must here express my gratitude: I am now in the seventy third year of my age, and afflicted with a severe nervous disorder. I might now have been a curate and writing for my bread; but I owe my present easy and independent circumstances, to the Duke of Northumberland, and Lord Thurlow.On genius frowns, and bows the knee to Hurde. Yet though his strains, how well soe'er he sings, Charm not the callous ear of modern kings; Perhaps his generous lordship, or his grace, Acquainted well with the poetic race, Acquainted with the free, the fervid mind, Which, in it's ardour, levels all mankind, Some chosen favour for the bard intends; Genius, at length, it's happy star befriends. A poor black slave this noble lord would buy, And marks our hero with a selfish eye; A poet with a paltry sum invites, To guard his mansion from infernal sprights; To teach him how to live, and how to die— For a rich miser to obtain the sky; Priscian's cold rules minutely to explain, To lead dull pupils to Minerva's fane; To bear the pedagogue's oppressive load; To reap where step-dame nature never sowed. I blush to view a melancholy scene; Poets, as mortals, must be sometimes mean. Censure will rail when candour will forgive; Few, through all trials, can undaunted live. He, to whom fortune ever was a foe, He, who hath struggled, from his birth, with woe, May feel at length his generous powers decay; The Muse's flame, neglected, dies away. Perhaps you wish the Poet may retain A mind as vigorous as his moral strain; Then opportunely all his ills redress, Nor suffer him to sink by long distress; Give not humanity too much to bear; All characters are levelled by despair. The bard, against grim want no longer proof (His robes turn brown, and Dodsley stands aloof) Accepts this offer, and is dubbed, at once, A chapel-organ, and a plodding dunce. Unequal station! most preposterous fate! Worst of all bad connexions with the Great! A Spartan Helot in a month he's grown, Watches, with awe, my lady's smile and frown; Hangs, with feigned rapture, on his grace's words, On some stale nonsense from the house of lords; Important truth investigates no more, But seems surprised that two and two make four: To servile art his genius is confined, Each movement of his body and his mind: His life he models by a blockhead's plan, And for the fantocino quits the man. These constant fetters if he will not wear, Almost as galling ills he's doomed to bear. Severe, oh hapless genius, is thy fate! While private knaves, or plunderers of the state Shine in the box, or in the chariot roll, What cruel torment oft invades thy soul! Condemned, for bread, without the inspiring power, To counteract the dull, the languid hour; Beneath thy genuine energy to write, To earn, with pain, the poor, extorted mite; Condemned to drudge in sickness, and in health, To starve, and raise thy dull oppressor's wealth, Who pities thee, who values thee no more Than Barbary-pirates those who tug the oar; To sooth, with change, the idle, and the vain, Who sick of trifles, trifle with thy strain; Amuse a coxcomb lounging o'er his tea, Or while the Frenchman forms the smart toupee; Divert from cent per cent city-sage, Tired with the ledger's more important page. But with the golden crisis when thou'rt blest, And all the god inspires thy ardent breast; When worthy themes the happy hours employ, Strong is thy verse, Elysian is thy joy. Then all the magick of the muse is thine, Their powers, idea, and expression join; And word gives force to word, and line ennobles line. Music, from rapture sprung, thy strains impart, At once they charm the ear, and thrill the heart. In them no flower, no shady tree is placed Of barren words amidst a dreary waste. No weak effusions thine, no sleepy tale, Begot by Langhorne on his Burton-ale: In thee no languid epithets we find, No words, which never were before combined: Happy their bard, to find some hackneyed scene, The chrystal fountain, or the velvet green! Him fancy in his calmer hours inspires, When warmed by books and her with gentler fires; When Livy, or when Tacitus he reads, And emulates, in thought, heroic deeds; Enjoys, without the labour to compose, Lucretian verse, or Ciceronian prose. Yet, in his mind, the moderns too excel In great atchievements, and in writing well; No nameless dignity to him appears In the dread sanction of two thousand years. Gay Horace, for his pure Augustan lays Better, he thinks, deserves the lyric bays Than Pindar, for his Greek, and age renowned; Now in the clouds, now in the low profound, Now on the circus, now in Jove's abode, Parent of nonsense in the shape of ode. Old books he reads not to secure a claim, By meagre learning, to scholastic fame; Not for the Roman, or Athenian tongue, But for the truths they've urged, the strains they've sung; Not a Dutch commentator's art to show, Which pedants, had they sense, would blush to know. The bard, despising literary toys, Each paper-edifice of bearded boys, Studies the ancients with superior views, His reason to inform, enrich his muse; Of men the various nature to explore, Select, with taste, from fancy's genial store; Their spirit to imbibe, like them to shine, And pour their lustre on his glowing line. Peace to the men with lucubration pale, Who at the flights of modern genius rail; A sounding rant from Æschylus rehearse, Throw light on Lycophron's obscurest verse; Their learning on the Laticlave display, Of fools the wonder, and of wits the prey! He cares not how the Spartan broth was made, Nor how the old latrunculi were played; The medal's dubious face he'll ne'er deplore, Nor try the huge digamma to restore: He leaves the childish torture of the brain To father Bentley, and his critic-train; Leaves the small graces, and the war of words To slashing Warburtons and piddling Hurdes. To feeling minds would men of learning write? Let pleasure, in their works, with truth unite. The bard whose lively sentiments require Chaste elegance transfusing generous fire; Who hates that clumsy Goth, scholastic pride, With which bad taste is constantly allied; Studious, himself, of composition's laws, With toil, and langour erudition draws From Warburton's profound, but muddy source, Whose style is negligent, and rude his force; Who, if great Julian for his theme he takes, Of the sick reader an Apostate makes. Seldom the poet's warmth such writers cool; Nor the dogmatical, nor flimsy school He seeks; but consecrates important hours To names distinguished by sublimer powers; From whom you read the dictates of the heart, Where nature is, with ease, enforced by art; Pedantic language who disdain to speak, And fright not readers with superfluous greek; Improve the thoughts of others by their own, And work rough learning to a mellow tone; Like Johnson, tuneful, animated, strong, Our living glory both in prose and song. The godlike few, who rouzed by glory's charms, Acquire supremacy in arts, and arms, Who urged by fervid energy of mind, Shoot from the orbit of the human kind, Poets with sympathetic warmth admire, And while they view their deeds, catch all their fire. “Heroes are much the same, the point's agreed, “From Macedonia's madman to the Swede; “The whole strange purpose of their lives, to find, “Or make an enemy of all mankind. “Not one looks forward; onward still he goes, “Yet ne'er looks forward farther than his nose.” So sung the Twitnham-swan, whose throb for praise To valour should have given more liberal lays. How couldst thou, Pope, with sacrilegious pen, With Bedlam's changelings rank the first of men; Thou too, like them, a candidate for fame, Your races different, but your goal the same? Is this philosophy's expanded truth? Is this the character of Pella's youth? Of him, whose genius conquered like his sword, Of men in letters, as in arms, the lord; Relaxed from state, or from the martial plain, Who soothed his nights with Homer's lofty strain; With the dread steel it lay beneath his head, Each Pallas guardian of the hero's bed. Divine humanity was all his own, As bright his candour as his ardour shone. Witness his feelings when Darius bled, The pomp funereal, and the tears he shed. His rival he had fought, and Greece's foe, But gave to suffering virtue all his woe; With soft compassion tempered conquest's plan, The monarch vanquished, but deplored the man. Tell me by what authentic marks we find This king a rancorous foe to human kind? At Babylon the victor yields his breath; What unaffected sorrows grace his death! Courtiers have that within which passeth show, By stupor turned to monuments of woe; Nations subdued lament their conqueror's fate; Their love had stretched his life to Nestor's date. The world's encomiums heedless verse defy, And give succeeding obloquy the lye. In vain for glory heroes toil, and bleed, If madness gives the image of the Swede. For me, let policy admire the Czar; My soul adores this thunderbolt of war; Led by the honest impulse of the muse, Loves what dull Dutchmen call romantic views; With pleasure sees this prodigy drawn forth By three rapacious robbers of the North; Beholds this unexpected comet rise, Advance, and fix all trembling Europe's eyes, And shoot its train athwart the polar skies. Yes, I exult, while fancy fees the boy, New to war's music, pant with martial joy; Rush on, impetuous, as his course began, A dauntless youth, and a tremendous man; Slave to no pleasure, to no mean desire, But for disputed empire all on fire; Nor rich domains, nor wine, nor love his aim, His soul impelled, absorbed by glory's flame. Anxious, his rise, meridian, and decline, I view, and feel his varied fortune mine. When victory quits him with perfidious wing, Still more the muse admires her favourite king; Whose soul erect, unconquerably great, Impassive to the rudest shocks of fate, Asserts to empire its inherent claim, And what in power it loses, gains in fame. Famine, and cold against his arms conspire; Nor cold, nor famine damp the hero's fire. Corporeal wants may weaker minds appal, Still he obeys his nature's noblest call; By glory taught in Russian wilds to glow, Like Hecla burning in a waste of snow: Jealous of her, even in his fortune's wane, He spurns cold treaties with a firm disdain, Nor with one vulgar act obscures his reign. Successful greatness let the world descry, To greatness in misfortune, blind it's eye; I see him brightest in Pultowa's fray, Bursting in splendour through the gloomy day: I see him brightest, when in Bender's fort, He fights the army of a powerful court, A captive Swede alarming all the Porte. Beings original to poets give, Not those who rightly, but who greatly live. Had e'er this equal king been brought to yield, At Bender proved more tame than in the field; Swerved from the dauntless purpose of his heart, And played, one hour, the driveling statesman's part; I, though an humble suitor to the Nine, Would not have thought him worth a single line; Would have surveyed him with a mind as cool As those who call him lunatick, or fool. Let purblind kings, and ministers of state Pronounce his actions mad, we'll deem them great. And would those intellectual pigmies know What to themselves, and to mankind they owe; Let them pursue their art; with rule and line, The safe, the right, the politic define; Nor tempt the vast, the boundless, the divine. Then Poets, judge not with the vulgar train; Enlarged your thoughts, and liberal be your strain. You should illustrate each important theme: Keep you awake, though Aldermen must dream; Whose muddy eyes perceive not glory's light, Or dimmed with envy, sicken at the sight; Who would not suffer wits, or kings to range Beyond the frigid maxims of the 'Change; Rashly applaud, or stupidly condemn, Bluster in port, or gravitate in phlegm; Political with moral right confound, Too gross their opticks to discern the bound; Vent with their wares, the nonsense of the day, And read two Ledgers by the aid of Say. As Sol his genial warmth, and brightness gives To every clime where human nature lives; So will the bard from none who merit fame Withhold the influence of the muse's flame. He loves each land where generous virtues reign, The German valour, and the truth of Spain. His soul, by no mean prejudice confined, Expands, and meets it's brethren in mankind. Within the hallowed space of Christian ground, Candid and liberal priests there can be found; Who strive to keep their simple flock in awe, Of Christ's example, of his moral law; A Wakefield's Vicar if the world can show, In affluence humble, and august in woe; Whose sermons recommend his generous deeds; Who urges morals, and relaxes creeds; Who makes the cause of human kind his own, Who agonizes at the widow's groan; Raised above self, deems virtue all his gain, The naked clothes, and blunts the sting of pain; Although he never hath bestowed a thought On what Augustin, or Ignatius wrote; Artless on words, on mysteries to refine, Him he admires, and counts a great divine. Poets reject the sacerdotal strain, Their verse a foe to voluntary pain: They bid us all the sweets of life enjoy, Which nor our conscience, nor our health annoy; Bid us consider our ambiguous frame, Nor think on earth to catch a seraph's flame: Be half to sense, and half to soul inclined, Nor chill the body while we warm the mind; Bid us our fancy actuate, and refine With love's high transports, and the joys of wine; Worship, with generous deeds, the great first cause, Nor dream by prayers and tears to change his laws; Through life's short passage, innocent and gay, Move to the dark, irremeable way; Secure in Him who first inspired our breath, Unerring Arbiter of life, and death. Say, to a proverb, why are Poets poor, And why regardless of the golden store? They surely, whose acute inquiries find The various flexures of the human mind, Must, from the slightest observation, see That poverty and power but ill agree; That want the outcast seems of earth and heaven, That much is sold to man, but little given; That wealth exempts us from ignoble art, To godlike deeds impels the liberal heart; Sheds warmth and lustre on the Poet's line, And to full inspiration bribes the Nine. But gradual riches to discretion flow, In dull meanders regularly slow. The bard, a gay economist of time, Of life tenacious in it's transient prime, Yields to the influence of the joyous hour, Of interest prodigal in pleasure's bower. The call of Bacchus how can he refuse?— The jovial God propitiates every muse; Gently extracts misfortune's pungent stings, And all Elysium to the fancy brings. Forgive him, stoics, if he should not wear Your heavy armour, to resist the fair; If Cupid oft allures him from your school, If ardent feelings cannot work by rule. Must not the nymph whom amorous passion warms, Whom love suffuses with celestial charms, Attract him to the greatest bliss we know, Which heightens every joy, sooths every woe; The fiercest nature tames, with soft controul, Refines, invigorates, and exalts the soul; Auspicious ever to a Poet's aim, Rapture congenial with the muse's flame? Add that his conscious greatness makes him bold; He feels a nobler power than that of gold. To vice, or fortune is his fund a prey? The generous muses will the loss repay. Poets the blight of penury endure With manly hearts, of future bliss secure; Still with creative souls endowed, they know The sweets of genius will not cease to blow; In thoughts, productive of immortal strains, Still a luxuriant Paradise remains. But by the providence of equal heaven, No great endowments unallayed are given; No bliss exclusive of it's woe we gain; Even virtue, godlike virtue hath it's pain. If you, ye calmer souls no title claim To joys ecstatic, or immortal fame; Yet prudence often all your actions guides; The watchful goddess o'er your life presides: And he to whom she deigns her partial care, Nullum numen habes si sit prudentia; nos te Nos facimus fortuna deam, cœloque locamus. Juvenal.Finds all the Gods propitious to his prayer. Smoothly you glide along the stream of life, Your bark unhurt by elemental strife; For you a trade-wind speeds it's happy gale; Fair blows the breeze, and gently swells the sail; Of no rude storm are you the fatal sport, By a strait course your pilot makes the port. But Poets, born beneath a baleful star, Fortune opposes with perpetual war; Rarely a happy medium smooths their lives; A calm detains them, or a tempest drives. On fancy too intent, their ardent youth Forgets a simple, but important truth; That gold, with magic power, our life befriends, Promotes ignoble, or exalted ends; Gives Harley's babble Ciceronian force, Or speeds the Poet's Pegasean course: That if slow prudence heaps the glittering hoard, The vain, the dull, the worthless are adored, That without gold fair virtue shines in vain, And starving bards awake the tuneful strain; Otways for callous kings prepare their lays, Who tantalize their poverty with praise. By harsh experience taught, at length they find The unrelenting nature of mankind; Are forced, their souls depressed with fortune's frown (A state unfit for works of high renown!) To animate the heart, to store the head, To barter genius for their daily bread. With all the sufferings of a feeling frame, Poor is the solace of a deathless name. The bard enjoys ethereal bliss to-day; Bright are his thoughts, and vigorous is his lay: To-morrow brings a melancholy scene; Relaxed, untuned is all the fine machine; Fancy no longer strews her glowing flowers, But sad ideas crowd the dreary hours. Dead to his poignant pleasures, and his muse, Life's ills in all their magnitude he views; The patron's lies, the meteor, public breath, The pain of malady, the gloom of death. The Poet feels not for himself alone; He makes the cause of human kind his own; The labyrinth of life with grief surveys, And tries in vain to thrid the clouded maze; Surveys, with grief, the ills our passions cause, And grandeur's bold contempt of moral laws: Deplores the fatal progress of the mind, More prone to vice as more by arts refined: Deplores the modest widow's hapless lot, By every friend and every saint forgot; To cold, and want from social comforts driven, The seeming outcast of mysterious heaven. Regrets the peer's inhospitable door, Barred on the learned, and the virtuous poor; Spontaneous opening, by preposterous fate, To every fox, and every wolf of state. Yet is his pensive soul on heaven reclined; Yet beams of consolation cheer his mind: He hopes, and images a better life, Where worth with misery quits the painful strife; Where all Arabia sheds her sweet perfume, Where zephyrs ever breathe, and roses bloom; Where, without labour, truths sublime we know, Where strains divine, and voluntary, flow; Where bards to empyrean heights aspire, And for the poet's catch the seraph's fire. Ye milder souls; ye men of simple prose, Whose life in one unvaried tenour flows; Oh! envy not a favourite of the muse His thrilling pleasures, his expanded views! 'Tis true, your spirits are too cool to brand With ardent satire a luxurious land: 'Twill not be yours, in some immortal work, To spread the fame of Lyttelton, and Burke; You'll not, like Harris, warm, at once, and sage, Brighten, with Plato's fire, the moral page; Nor by your tragedy's resistless power, Make Ligonier a Vestal for an hour. 'Twill not be yours, in a soft vernal eve, The noisy haunts of vulgar minds to leave; Serenely pensive, in the silent glade, To walk, inspired by each parnassian maid; To view the mild descending god of day, Your fancy kindled by his parting ray: And when Diana, with her fairer light, Displays the sober majesty of night; To mount, through space, beyond her silver car, And dart, in thought, to the remotest star. 'Twill not be yours to make the lighter hours Gay handmaids to the intellectual powers: Bacchus, to whom promiscuous mortals bow, Solace of Cæsars, and of Catos too, Will ne'er make you poetically gay, Nor to your mind the ideal world display. Love you may feel; but not its heavenly charms, It's finer magic which the fancy warms; Gives Phœbus' sons the bliss of gods to share, To need no muses if they win the fair. You'll ne'er with magnanimity despise The pomp of life which dazzles vulgar eyes. Thread-bare, or ragged, boldly walk the street, Nor gratify with shame the fools you meet; Calmly move on, intent on moral song, Deaf to the jibings of the tinsel throng; Fortune defy, man's dignity maintain, And vice in splendour view with just disdain; In virtue's cause inflexibly severe, Drag forth the villain lurking in the peer. Yet liberal tenets learn, ye men of phlegm, And be not rash to envy, or condemn: Contented with your humble talents live, And genius its eccentric flights forgive. Let not your spleen arraign the great first Cause, But calmly study his impartial laws. He, bounteous parent of this earthly ball, Imparts, with equal hand, his gifts to all. Comfort in each privation we may find, Some soothing bliss to equipoise the mind. Sad contrasts gall the rich and joyous train; Near Pleasure's palace is the cave of Pain. The peasant oft may boast an envied store: What man, with health, and innocence, is poor? Harmonious world! where beings of each frame In concert act with heaven's unerring aim! Thus the bard's quick, and comprehensive soul, Whose flights no gross, material clogs controul; Who to his view, with strange attraction, brings This universe, and all created things; Who snatches powers beyond a mortal's fate, And when he scorns to picture, can create— The bard, with properties divine endowed, Proclaims how ill it suits us to be proud: From sensibility, that active spring, Which gives rapidity to fancy's wing, Rude shocks he feels, by which are dearly bought His short-lived joys, his luxury of thought; Condemned with numerous, and with pungent pains To pay the glory of immortal strains. A quiet tenour it is yours to keep; Passion in you, and reason, half asleep. In placid apathy you draw your breath, Your lives a prelude to the calm of death: And varied raptures if you never know, You 'scape the rack of complicated woe. POETICAL EXCURSIONS IN THE ISLE OF WIGHT. ? Casia, atque aliis intexens suavibus herbis, Mollia luteola pingit vaccinia caltha. Et vos, O Lauri, carpam; et Te, proxima, myrte; Sic positæ quoniam suaves miscetis odores. Virgil. Eclog. II. ver. 49. TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE LORD CAMDEN. 1777. Once more, Elysian isle, Receive me with thy vernal smile; Nor to a grateful muse Thy powerful aid refuse: Propitious to the poet's mind, Thy striking scenes impart; His fancy warm, improve his art; Who from the anxious follies of mankind, Who from the selfish, and the splendid throng, Harrassed with trifles, joys to flee To sacred solitude, and thee, To wake his long-neglected song; By pleasing melancholy rapt, delights to rove, On thy bright verdure, through some twilight grove; There to recall the mighty dead, Who greatly thought, or greatly bled; To see, through fancy's magic eye, Lycurgus plan, and Cato die; There, in poetic luxury to grieve; To melt in strong imagined woe; The sympathetic sigh to heave; Till, as the sweet enchantment steals, It nobly triumphs, and he feels Enthusiastic tears for struggling virtue flow. And oft the bard's elastic mind To lighter images inclined; In concord with Anacreon's measure, Courts the jovial gods of pleasure; For livelier aid invokes the tuneful maids; And feels a modern Cyprus in thy shades. Then ideas fair, and gay Chace the rapid hours away; Then, created by the muse, A festal groupe the poet views; Of dance, of song, of love, the powers, Their sprightly revels hold amid thy bowers: Bacchus, and his train are there; Rosy Cupids, light as air, Meet his warm, enamoured eye, Scattering odours as they fly. He hears the flute's relaxing sound; A purple glory spreads around: The graces, and the Cyprian queen Advance and dignify the scene; The graces model beauty's pride, Their lustre to her charms apply, Direct the lightning of her eye, Wave her celestial robe, and o'er her steps preside. Through all his frame he feels her soft controul; Each motion charms the sight; each look pervades the soul. Since, then, alike the grave, and gay, The moral, and the sportive lay I cultivate in thee, my favourite isle, And all my pungent woes beguile; Oh! let thy rural genius deign Again to animate my strain; Enlarge my judgment, guide my fire, For with no mean ambition I aspire O'er a fair sister-isle thy beauties to diffuse: To consecrate thy humble name, And rank it, in poetic fame, With Cooper's-Hill, with Windsor, with Vaucluse; From rigorous time to vindicate my theme; To give, by my descriptive page, Congenial minds, through every age, In thee to trace the bold, romantic shore; From the steep mountain to explore The charms of the contiguous vale, Where blooms the pastoral scene; where breathes the pastoral tale; Where nature knows not art's alloy, The vale of peace, and unembittered joy: To bid thy flowers perennial blow, Thy trees with never-fading verdure grow, In silver strains thy soft Medina flow, Winding, and clear, and smooth, as Arno's hallowed stream. Oh! Knighton, where the sight pursues Rich, various, and majestic views; Oft, when the early lark ascends the skies, Let me from life's oblivion rise, And to thy land-mark's height repair, To breathe its down's elastic air; With eye poetic to survey The glories of the new-born day; Where scenes of nature, works of art, Expand the mind, and move the heart; Where, on the soul, the beautiful, and grand Impress the ocean, and the land; Here, an extended vale of sweets The senses, and the fancy greets; There, at Spithead, with canvass furled, Britannia's floating castles ride, The spirit strong that armed their pride, That sent their thunder, oft, round an affrighted world. When thus, by prospect, and by thought, My mind to harmony is wrought; Already conscious of the rising strain, The path to Knighton I regain. My progress is arrested near the vane; For there I view, below, the mansion, and the trees, Not yet saluted by the gentlest breeze; And there I take my favourite stand, Their solemn graces to command. 'Tis silence, all; and all around I feel the force of rural ground. But, hark! the distant voice of Chanticleer, With note protracted soothes my ear; And hark, I hear attentive Tray The flock directing on their way. While yet no human triflers, vain, and rude, On thoughts contemplative intrude; No noise, nor tinsel of the day; The mansion says, or seems to say; (The mansion, is a fabric old, Ivy, and yew it's walls infold; A grove, in high, and verdant pride, Extends a winding length on either side; The nod majestic of the groves Their mansion's oracle approves.) “Although my blooming ground is low, Even from that ground a bard should know, That as this hallowed house, at first was given To spirits who conversed with heaven, None yet admittance here should find But beings of exalted mind. Or they whose gentle natures could not bear Society's inclement air; Who, vice deserting, but to virtue true, Have bid a faithless world adieu. Or they who have a right to claim A sacred, but a prostituted name, That such a god-like habit comprehends! The few sincere, and ardent Friends, Whose lives, nor interest, nor low pleasure blends, But noble means, exerted still for noble ends: Or poets blessed with rich, expanded views, With souls impassioned by the muse; Or they, whose generous bosoms prove All the divine romance of love.” The charms of Shanklin, now their picture claim; Shanklin, a rude, and unrecorded name, Asserts it's title to poetic fame. Here nature, spurning art's controul, Surprises, and absorbs the soul; Here soars the poet, all, impassioned mind, And leaves his earthly clog behind. Then let the form, and pressure of the place With style unlaboured my description grace; It's free, wild beauties let the bard rehearse, With native strength, in corresponding verse: Let it's own genius his attempt inspire With negligent, with rapid fire; Draw forth expression bold, the raptures of the lyre. Here, on old ocean's brink, Oh! be it oft my bliss to think; And let my vigorous, my aspiring thought To genuine poetry be wrought. Let me from fair, and from majestic scenes, Catch all, their form, their hue, their disposition, means. Let the muse bear me o'er the main; And let me Neptune's region find Expressive of the poet's mind, As active, and as large as his domain. To gain more images, I'll draw My contemplation from the deep; Turn to the shore's abrupt, and towering steep, That rears it's head aloft, and strikes with pleasing awe. But lo! the rugged cliffs between, Steals on my view a mild, contrasted scene; A blooming valley to my memory brings All that my long-neglected Ovid sings, In his harmonious, and descriptive page, Of times of better gold, of the primæval age. The labours, here, of needy art Nor hurt the eye, nor wound the heart; Nor nature's liberty restrain, Nor mark the bondage of the swain. Spontaneous, here, the hawthorn grows, And with profusion yields it's fragrant rose. No modern axe, with unrelenting wound, Has yet polluted this innoxious ground. Old beeches, here, exclude meridian day, And through the vale repeat the shepherd's lay; For Tityrus, wide their verdure spread, And canopy his careless head. No Melibæus, in Sicilian strains, Of Mars's crimson car, Of the destructive rage of civil war, Of merciless prætorian bands, Let loose on cultivated lands, Of his invaded fields; of tyrants yet complains. Congenial scenes to fancy's eye succeed, The waving field, the flowery mead; And while her mimic objects rise, Their imagery to realize, The neighbouring beauties to explore, I quit the grandeur of the shore; Ascend the precipice, with winding way, And meet the sun's declining ray. O'er him his clouds fantastic spread, Hues of ethereal glory shed, Sable, and violet, and red; Veil his insufferable blaze of light; Attract, and fix, and charm the steddy sight; Mild, yet august, he gilds the summer's eve, The beauteous landscape loth to leave; Night's leaden sway the rosy god regrets, And hesitates, and lingers, while he sets. The browzing flock, along the verdant slope, Nor pained by fear, nor lured by hope, Unconscious of the murdering knife, Enjoy the blessings of immediate life. Inbosomed in a deep, and solemn shade, Nor needing Brown's expensive aid. The peaceful cottage, hoary grown with age, Instructs us better than the moral page, And woos mistaken foppery, to be sage; Enforces each important theme, Dissolves the gay, luxurious dream; Warns us the villa's tawdry show Allures us to disease, and woe: Subdues irregular desires, And kindles in the breast its purer fires; Of grandeur's pomp corrects the childish awe; Warns us there's but one flowery way, Whate'er the sons of dissipation say; The way the wise have ever trod; 'Tis nature; and it terminates in God;— Our legislator, this; and that, his easy law. In it's fine frenzy moves the poet's eye, Creates new forms 'twixt earth and sky; Celestial forms, which rise not at the call Of the great vulgar, or the small. He sees Hygeia, rosy queen, With agile flight, and lively mien, The fair antagonist of grisly Death Diffuse her aromatic breath; Impregnate all the circumambient air, The cottages, and woods, each dryad's care; Skim o'er the hamlet, and inhale Her own essential sweets in every gale. Of aspect soft, tranquillity he sees Recumbent on the dying breeze: The placid goddess, on her downy wings, Her zephyrs bland, her soothing odours brings: O'er the calm landscape gently floats, Listening to Philomela's notes. There, how the peasants are supremely blest, By solitude, by silence is expressed; Their sprightly health, by day; by night, their balmy rest. Harrassed with public life, with generous care, With all the toil that patriots bear, Wilkes, by philosophy inspired, To Shanklin, from applauding crowds retired; To cherish thoughts exalted, and refined, To meditate the weal of human kind, To soothe an attic, and a spartan mind. There, while, at eve, along the grove he trod; Sent by Britannia's tutelary god, Ghosts who inspire to conquer, or to die, In Roman armour, passed before his eye. The pensive Cassius, there, with smile severe, Bade him, the patriot's course undaunted steer. Next, the humaner Brutus came, The first, of liberty's illustrious band, The deathful weapon in his better hand! It caught Diana's candid ray, And flashed with momentary day; For thrice he shook the sword, and thrice approved his flame. He made the Briton all his own; Gave him his soul's determined tone; Our freedom only with his life to yield: O'er the whole figure of the godlike shade All the last Roman was displayed; His arms, his port, his aspect were the same That met the giant-form at famed Philippi's field I here viewed Mr. Wilkes, in his publick character; as a conspicuous patron, and defender of British freedom. I cannot now recapitulate all his successful exertions for the rights of Englishmen; I shall only mention one, his prosecution of the king's ministers for their Turkish infliction on his domestic securities, by a general warrant; and to this constitutional act, I add the glorious and independent decision of Lord Chief Justice Pratt, for their abolition. Mr. Wilkes's intrepid and persevering opposition to the power of a court, will greatly contribute to make his name interesting to posterity. Whenever any defender of a character high in publick life, can find nothing splendid and magnanimous in it, he lays a particular stress on his private virtues, which have very little connexion with the prosperity of the state, and which it is the duty of every good christian to possess, and to practise. My passage in favor of Mr. Wilkes, is, if I may be allowed to judge of any thing that I have written, luminous, and strong; but I have always highly dissapproved the assassination of Julius Cæsar. 1809.. Say, whither shall the muse next point her flight, Since landscapes all around allure the sight? Shall she to lofty Carisbrook urge her wing, An awful Pharos to each British king? Where from the mouldering fort she may command A fair expanse of ocean, and of land. Or shall she bend her course to Under-way, A fertile shore for the descriptive lay? Where sea, and ether's border bound the eye; On land, where nature's rampart threats the sky: And where, these noble views between, The humble cottage beautifies the scene; The spot surrounding it arrayed With brilliant flowers, with spreading shade, And herbage of a lively green. Let not self-love, my muse, thy powers beguile; Think not to paint each prospect of this isle; Presume not from thy limits to depart; Nature, exhaustless in her stores, Through heaven, through air, through ocean, and the land, With a profuse, yet a judicious hand, Infinite elegance, and grandeur pours, That mock the poet's fire, that mock the poet's art. Thrice fortunate, thrice happy isles! For most in them propitious beauty smiles. It's fame in Grecian isles the world shall know As long as Grecian numbers flow. We feel, in England, all it's powerful sway; It's generous dictates active to obey. There every noble deed the sex inspire; 'Tis theirs to animate the soldier's fire, And wake to extasy the poet's lyre. And Vectis, too, may boast her numerous fair; Mild are the charms of her Trohair; Who can behold, and not admire Her Lee's vivacity, and fire! While in my being memory holds a place, Can I forget what elegance, what grace In the Delgarnos are combined With inoffensive wit, with dignity of mind! If hospitality deserves it's fame; If poets feel the force of beauty's claim; Oh! may the muse give splendour to my line, And bid the name of Worseley shine! To Christian, too, my gratitude must pay The tribute of its ardent lay. The winning beauties of her frame Her soul's auguster charms proclaim. Nature, in her, and culture blend The gay companion, and the zealous friend, With all the sacred virtues of the wife; Bright ornament of private, and of publick life Where all these fair ladies may be now, I know not. 1809.! In this fair island, in a summer's eve Our common pleasures oft I leave; And hold my unpremeditated way, Till night has moved through half her sway: O'er down, through vale, through grove I stray; Where Philomela tunes her plaintive lay; And where to heighten contemplation's hour, From ancient wall, or gothic tower, Responsive owls their dirge prolong; And though their voice is not the ton; Though fops of taste abhor their song; Yet he whom nature strongly charms, Whom true poetic genius warms, With all the beautiful and grand, Which then adorn the sky, the sea, the land, Would rather hear their note of woe Than all the tricks the Linleys know. The sweets of solitude completely to display; To give them philosophick day, In her full orb The conscious moon, through every distant age, Hath held a lamp to wisdom. ? Night-Thoughts., the conscious moon Arrives at her nocturnal noon; The moon, whose oracle, through every age, Inspires the poet, and instructs the sage. Objects like these were meant, in Heaven's high plan, As it relates to sublunary man, To bid us leave low cares, and joys behind; By them collected, and composed the mind, By them concentered, with more strength it flows Through the rich, various, ample fields that fancy shows. While thus the fair nocturnal queen Sheds her soft rays on each romantic scene, Improved, compleated by her orb serene; While her warm pupil fancy leads O'er hills, o'er rivulets, o'er meads: While her attentive student reads A nervous eloquence in all he sees, And feels a muse in every breeze, A spire salutes his sight, that gleams athwart the trees. The prospect of the venerable fane Corrects the bard's luxuriant strain; The sallies of imagination breaks, And reason from her flowery vision wakes; Spread it's grave influence all around, And consecrates Arcadian ground; Gives a severer majesty to night, And throws a pleasing horrour o'er the silver light. Religion lends her salutary aid, Impressed more strongly by the silvan shade, Impressed more strongly by the lunar beam, Propitious ever to the hallowed theme. She bids him recollect the time, When he'll despise the trifle, rhyme; Call to his mind that awful hour, When nought will cheer his soul but her celestial power. When he must bid his last adieu To every rich, and varied view; No more must haunt Idalian groves, To meet the graces, and the loves; Pervade no more, with the quick lightning's glance, Creation's infinite expanse; The vernal earth, the star be-spangled sky; When death shall draw his veil before the poet's eye: But soon the strong memento fades, Urged by the temple, through the shades. For though the sun enlightens idle play, In which we fritter time away; Though gilded trifles waste the day; Even in the calm, and solemn reign of night, Meteors, and glow-worms mock the sight: Still virtue's guards insidious foes annoy, Some gaudy vapour, some delusive joy: Still we forget the proper thoughts of man, How life must end, why life began. Though reason's oracles unfold Our mad rapacity for gold; Our airy tenure of a name, And break the glittering bubble, fame; Yet the delirium soon returns, Again the moral fever burns; Intent on selfish, on luxuriant views, The miser hoards his wealth; the poet woos his muse. Then in his bosom bright ideas teem; Each tender, each exalted theme: Not the gay follies of the present age, Nor past barbarity his thoughts engage. Not to When I wrote this, she gave masquerades in Soho-square. 1809. Cornellys' dome his fancy flies, Where the fell sorceress her dread magic plies. Breaks friendly, breaks connubial ties; Untainted honour turns to foul disgrace; And changes, by her instantaneous wand, To monstrous shapes the nobles of our land; Impious transformer of the human race! Nor doth he muse on sacerdotal gloom; On abject prayers at the proud Becket's tomb; On Britain once enslaved by papal Rome: On the black empire of the priestly tribe, Who paradise preclude, or open, for a bribe, Who substitute, for generous deeds, Unnatural penance, puerile beads, And blind belief in doating creeds: Who darken reason's heaven-descended ray, Usurp fair virtue's rightful sway, Her golden sceptre of benign command; And wield an iron rod, with a relentless hand. To him on brighter scenes intent, The azure sky, the shade, the moon are lent; On scenes congenial with the mind; Endeared by nature to mankind. Borne by the muse in these excursive hours, He flies to myrtle and to laurel bowers; He feels the lover's joys, the lover's woes; For every sentimental critick knows, That if the charms of an imaginary dame Inspire his genius with fictitious flame; Or, from a real fascinating eye, If the decisive lightnings fly, That kindle hope, or wake severest care; Raise him to bliss, or sink him to despair;— The sentimental critick knows, The soul exalted above prose, That every genuine poet's lyre, Is most responsive still to Cupid's fire; That then it plays it's most emphatick part, So strongly vibrates with its master's heart, That he, unconscious of the rules of art, Nor effort, nor elaborate order knows; But all, spontaneous, just, and strong, and ardent flows. Well-pleased, in fancy he surveys, With fancy's mimick tint pourtrays The fate elysian of the swain, Who, stranger to his nymph's disdain, Feels the true zest of Cupid's reign, His lasting joys enhanced by momentary pain. Oh! energy of bliss! transporting days! Superiour far to my aspiring lays! The fair-one rules with magic sway! And what strange miracles her spell obey! His path of life is decked with flowers; Rapid, and rosy are his hours; With spirit flushed, he knows no fears: Knows none but rapture's, and compassion's tears; For generous love expands the mind, And bids it glow for all the human kind. He shines with graces not his own; His voice assumes a soft, harmonious tone; Envious the men, and charmed, the fair, Remark his easy, lively, gallant air: For happy in himself, his manners tend Others to please, and to befriend. Conscious of his unrivalled state, Whom can he dread; whom can he hate? Nay, with romantick soul, he pities all, Whome'er it is his chance to see, Who are not in her heart enthroned, as he, Imaginary monarch of this earthly ball! But when of gold the ruthless power, And the grim priest, in a tremendous hour, To woe devoting beauty's prime, Pander to legal prostitution's crime, The passion of two hearts defeat, Which long in unison have beat; Say, can the most pathetic strain Describe the lover's agonizing pain? Solace, from business, pleasure, or the muse, By love absorbed, his thoughts refuse; He wastes, in gloom domestic, balmy days; There, on his drooping soul the poison preys; There, he's intent his misery to deplore; To think departed objects, o'er. He sees the dress, each ornament she wore, When last with rapture he beheld the fair, Then of his bliss the cause; but now of his despair. He sees how gracefully she walked; Hears with what sense, and harmony she talked; He hears each word that formed her last adieu; Feels what expression marked her lingering view. External signs, while thus he thinks, imply What strong emotions agitate his breast, How exquisitely he's distressed:— He stops;—now moves a quick, now tardy pace; The rose of youth has left his pallid face; Abruptly fixed, or voluble, his haggard eye. Stranger to rest, he'll often roam (Where can the wounded lover find a home?) Alas! the fatal ? Hæret lateri lethalis arundo. Virgil. dart Still rankles in his heart! In the full town, or solitary grove, Objects that gained high lustre from his love, Gave ten-fold pleasure to the happy swain, With fate capricious now conspire, With hostile gloom reproach his hopeless fire, And mock intolerable pain. Dusky, to him, and vapid is the rose, How fragrant, and how bright soe'er it blows. In him the senses are all dead; Their animating friend is fled; The soul's impression they no longer share; His soul is hovering round his distant fair. In ardent thought when he hath passed the night; Just when the dawn restores her sober light, Sleep seals his eyes, and a delusive dream, With flowery prospect, brings his constant theme. In some soft region like Cythera's isle, He hears the nymph converse; he sees her smile; While vernal glories decorate the ground; While myrtle bowers their odour shed around, And amorous musick breathes a tender sound. More soothing is her voice:—but lo! he wakes;— What barbarous dæmon this fair vision breaks!— While the gay forms of airy fiction fly, And real objects wound his eye, The sun invades him with obtrusive ray, And his benighted soul o'erwhelms with day. Long hath he sickened at the light, And courted, long, the hospitable night. For when inveloped in her friendly shade, And on the couch, remote from every witness laid; He vainly there anticipates relief; There the fond sigh, unnoticed he can heave; Give scope to all the luxury of grief, Unchecked by a tormenting world he longs to leave. Next, under Phœbe's placid light, As love another object bright, A favourite object he pursues; Fair freedom, next, his genius woos: And let him hope, the critick, here, Howe'er acute, howe'er severe, His just connexion will commend; For still she's love's inseparable friend. Where has the goddess found a safe retreat; Or in what country claims her publick seat? Her sway no more degenerate Europe shows; Not where the Thames, nor where the Texel flows; Nor where Geneva's lake, near Alpine snows, A scene magnificent compleats Of nature's grandeur, and her sweets. For freedom, there, is but an empty name; A senate, there, impassive to the fame Of their incorruptible son; Unmoved by all the laurels he had won, Of tyranny the most illustrious foe, Exiled a modern Brutus in Rousseau; While virtue's hoary pest, Voltaire, They suffer still to taint their air. He flies, in fancy, to a distant strand; Flies to America for British land I drew this political, and martial prospect of America, at the commencement of our civil war on that continent. My opinion of an individual, or of a state, is not hastily formed; therefore it is not changed, or influenced by superficial observation, or false narrative. I have by no means inferred from some trivial, and temporary advantages gained by Government on the other side of the Atlantick, nor from the servile ostentation of private correspondence, and report; nor from the pompous tale of the Gazette, that the Americans are divided in their councils; that they want arms, ammunition, courage, and the necessaries of life; or that any of the regal officers deserve the name of generals: therefore I do not yet apprehend the subjugation of our colonies.. Freedom her votaries there inspires, And bids them emulate their sires: They hear her voice, they catch her flame, It shoots, it thrills through every frame; And nobly prodigal of breath, They march undaunted forth to liberty, or death. Him, by his own sagacious view, Who all the human privileges knew; And first to freedom's standard flew, Hamden he sees, majestick form! Presiding o'er the civil storm: Stern Sydney's manes, too, is there, Their triumphs, their distress to share: And Russel, shade of amiable renown, Impassive to a ruthless tyrant's frown, Reluctant gives his high command, And animates the patriot-band; The steel decisive bids them draw; Bids them assert the generous plan, The universal cause of man, Impartial policy, and unobstructed law. Russel, and Sydney while I sing, While in their eulogy my numbers flow; The muse, with jealous, with indignant wing, Stoops to her quarry, their abandoned foe; To lasting infamy consigns Dalrymple, in vindictive lines. Could thy polluted art their glory stain, Portentous to a tyrant's reign? No:—from the putrid marsh, and lake, As vapours pestilential shroud, Awhile, the splendid god of day; And as we soon behold him break Forth from the black, sulphureous cloud, And shine with more effulgent ray:— So they, the prodigies of Charles's age, Illumine our historic page With brighter life, with more illustrious death, Fresh-beaming from the vapour of Dalrymple's breath. While thus he ranges unconfined, And glory fires his ardent mind; While primitive enjoyments are forgot; The simple objects of the rural vale Suggest their interesting tale; The smoak that issues from a neighbouring cot Reminds him of the peasant's happy lot; And by the bleating sheep, from their adjacent fold, With stronger energy the rustic tale is told. The chaste, the philosophick muse, Enamoured of these humble views, Invites him to the sage's favourite home; Whence that her votary ne'er may wish to roam, She paints the scenes of public life, Their tumult, their anxiety, their strife; Describes the pangs of an illustrious fate; Tells him, ambition's palm to gain, To vice exposes, and to pain; 'Tis safety, to be good; 'tis danger, to be great. She paints the realms of rosy health, Who dwells not with the pallid lords of wealth; Who dwells not with the literary train, Of erudition's toil, of lucubration, vain: She paints the pure and lasting joys, Which care, with haggard aspect, ne'er annoys: Tells him, if genuine bliss he means to know, He must not soar too high, nor sink too low; Nor court the gorgeous throne, nor seek the dreary cell;— With nature, peace, and truth, she bids the wanderer dwell. AN ELEGY; OCCASIONED BY THE DEATH OF A LADY's LINNET. Lugete, O Veneres Cupidinesque, Et quantum est hominum venustiorum! Nam mellitus erat, suamque norat Ipsam, tam bene quam puella matrem; Qui nunc it per iter tenebricosum, Illuc, unde negant redire quenquam. At vobis male sit malæ Tenebræ Orci, quæ omnia bella devoratis! Catullus; Carmen III. TO GEORGE GRAY, Esq. THIS ELEGY IS INSCRIBED; AS A TRIBUTE OF ESTEEM FOR HIS POETICAL TASTE, AND TALENTS; AND OF GRATITUDE FOR THE FRIENDSHIP WITH WHICH HE HONOURS IT'S AUTHOUR. London, January 28th, 1777. I. If sensibility, absorbed in woe, With art poetic e'er can flow, Sweet songster, to thy tuneful shade, The tribute of the muse be payed; Though to thy fate inadequate my lays; For since (I envy thee thy glorious doom! Bright contrast to the dreary tomb!) Thy life was Delia's care, thy death was Delia's pain, The verse adventurous should not I refrain? What honour canst thou reap from my aspiring praise? II. Could now the soft Tibullus live, To thee, musician sweet, his elegy he'd give: Thy destiny abrupt so great a bard should mourn, And scatter flowers, and laurels o'er thy urn. For sure a more affecting tale than thine Ne'er flowed along the plaintive line; Than thine a more affecting tale Was never told by shepherd, in the blooming vale. Death, which thy poet from the rack would free, Was deprivation of high bliss to thee. For though to sage divines 'tis given Exactly to prefigure heaven; To tell us what the soul shall there employ; Yet let their sacred leave Permit me to conceive Of glory no exceeding weight, That will preponderate that Elysian state, Which in our nether world thou didst enjoy. III. Say, was not Delia's chamber thine? And even a dungeon, where she lived, would shine! And where she doth not speak, and look, and move, A palace must a dungeon prove. Thy being did not her affection tend; Was Delia not thy mistress, and thy friend? And did not thy mellifluent strain Her ear enchanted oft detain? Did not her eye (divine reward!) approve Thy notes of gratitude, and love? Oh! to her banished Ovid might it's beam Athwart the clouds of this dark Pontus gleam, Reach, through my visual ray, my drooping heart; The lightning would poetic fire impart, And raise my genius to its beauteous theme! IV. Thou feathered songster, thou musician sweet, Few, in this iron world, thy honours meet; Ere fate inexorable called thy breath, Great were thy honours; they were great in death. Did not thy sickness wound thy Delia's heart? And did not she exhaust compassion's art, All the fond assiduity of grief, To bring her favourite bird relief? Was not thy languid frame by her fair hand caressed; And didst not thou expiring rest (Ecstatic death!) on her ambrosial breast? And when thy tuneful soul had fled away To myrtle groves, to realms of purer day; Did not she form thy little tomb, In that most consecrated ground Where warblers breathe, and odours float around; Where oft her beauties deaden Flora's bloom? And in the tomb did she not place thy bier, Bedewing it with many a tender tear; Those tears which o'er departed merit shed, And in the poet's hallowed numbers read, More durably than Egypt's art, embalm the dead? V. To thee his pæan, then, the bard should give; In elegy, for thee, he should not sigh; Thy life, 'twas rapture, all, to live; Thy death, 'twas luxury, to die. To one of human race would fate assign A span as narrow, but as blest as thine, Him as much pleasure would engage, As the most happy man, who lives to Nestor's age. But since I hope not to obtain Exuberance of bliss; since mental pain My days embitters, and infects my strain; And since with woe my future life Can but maintain a manly strife; May I, sweet bird, that life resign In a last scene as elegant as thine! Let a gay priestess of the muse, Who to the poet opens fancy's views, Her forms romantic, and her orient hues; Let some good nymph, as Delia, fair, Grant me her last, her tender care; Vouchsafe humanely to befriend, To cheer, to brighten, to adorn my end. Round me Parnassian glories then shall smile; And the cold horrour of the grave beguile; For in an angel of the female kind, Of person graceful, and of noble mind, The essence of all poetry we find. The fair-one will my soul prepare To wanton in Elysian air; My heart will feel a gentle fire; And imperceptibly I shall expire, To realize a previous dream, Pregnant with many a fair, and noble theme; With the soft climate of the future sky; With god-like bards in converse high; With all the fragrance of the myrtle grove, Where wander youths who died for love, No more to feel it's agonizing wound;— With silver lyres, and their ecstatic sound; With silver streams as musical as they; With thee, sweet warbler, on some aromatic spray! VI. Let her, my last, my lingering friend, My ashes to the grave attend; And when to dust consigned she sees me lie, Let pale, and eloquent distress Awhile her action, and her face impress; Be her's, awhile, the deep, pathetic sigh; And let the liquid pearl drop from her glistening eye. Be these my obsequies;—to them, how low Is all the dark procession, long, and slow; Are all the trappings of the sable show; The scutcheoned pageantry of mimick woe! When I 'twixt this world and the next, No more with sublunary trifles vexed, Have shot the deep, mysterious gulph; Oh! rather let these honours close My pleasures few, my numerous woes, Than all the funeral pomp of Newton, or of Wolfe! VII. Ye bowers of Tottenham, and it's groves, Henceforth be sacred to the nine, Henceforth be sacred to the loves. Oh! would the soul of Pope divine But condescend to mix with mine, Fair might the beauties, then, of Tottenham shine! No industry would I decline, No daring, no Pindaric flight, To give to Tottenham a perpetual name, And bid it emulate the fame Of Richmond's blooming hill, and Windsor's towering height. For there, his harmony no more, Lies the sweet poet I deplore. For, courting oft Hygeia, there, Delia resides to breath salubrious air; There oft she walks, in Sol's decline, Improving taste, and thoughts benign; She, there (too fond idea!) may peruse The labours of my humble muse; Haply she there may sometimes condescend To form the generous wish for her ill-fated friend. VIII. Then let each natural, and each moral grace Adorn, and dignify the place: Let spring, with partial vigour, there, Delight the eye, and scent the air: Let not inclement Boreas meet, With contrast quick, the summer's heat; Nor disappointed swain deplore, The loss of autumn's golden store. And still may rustic revels reign; And may the hamlet still maintain, When winter binds the hoary earth, It's festal cheer, and frolick mirth. But let the peasants, ever gay, Ne'er from innoxious pleasure stray. Let Hymen, there, with temperate rule, Improve on Cupid's ardent school. Let him diffuse his bright, and lambent fire Of chaste, and permanent desire: Not shake the torch of red, and baleful flame, With wanton, or with ruthless aim; Which, for the true connubial state, Guardian of manners, and of passions mild, Works a black scene of jealousy, and hate, Of lawless anarchy—of moral Chaos wild IX. May Zephyr, borne on downy wing, Propitious, Tottenham, to thy purple spring, Give all thy sweets luxuriantly to blow, Thy rivulet with murmuring course to flow; May showers that cool, and fertilize, Maturing suns, and azure skies Deck with the charms of Eden all thy plain. But, Oh! ye rosy vernal hours, And all ye rural powers, Embellish with Arabian flowers, With flowers of finest form, and richest bloom, And of most exquisite perfume; And shelter, with Arcadian shade, The ground where that mute chorister is laid, Whose life was Delia's care; whose death was Delia's pain. X. There let the soft, refreshing breeze Whisper through fair, and shady trees; Trees oft responsive to the shepherd's tongue; Majestic trees which Maro sung; And under them, to mark the spot of woe, Let yew, let ivy, and let cypress grow. Let the most fragrant rose his tomb adorn, With tint expressive of the morn: The lily white, the violet blue, Of mournful, and of pleasant hue; And let the woodbine, there, it's breath exhale To vesper's dying gale; The jasmine too, that loves the wall; Of elegant effluvias, all. There let the modest laylock spring (A tremor checks the muse's wing!) By Delia worne, the laylock's dye Hath often charmed the poet's eye: As late I walked by Delia's side, (Honour too great for human pride!) The native lustre of the lovely maid In art's refinements dangerously arrayed; My heart exulting in the rapturous hour, Her laylock robe confessed her power; The magic influence of the fair Improved it's colour, and it's air; To her a brighter blush I felt it owe; From her I felt it sweep with a celestial flow! THREE POEMS Cantantes, licet usque (minus via lædet) eamus. Virgil. Eclog. IX. ver. 64. TO HENRY COLLINGWOOD SELBY, ESQ. SIDDONS: A POEM. Vehemens in flectendo, in quo uno vis omnis oratoris est. Cicero.—Orator. A bard, whom no poetic ills appall, The patron's coldness, or the critic's gall; With generous effort, still asserts the bays; Or gives a brother's genius all its praise. Poets not merely, to their Phœbus owe That art which bids immortal numbers flow; The kind inspirer, to his favourite train, Gives, with his tuneful, his prophetick strain. They feel ambition's late, but lasting power And leave the vain their tinsel of the hour; Of justice from posterity secure, Calmly the malice of their age endure. But celebrated actors hardly save Their well-earned laurel from the ruthless grave; Their glory sickens at it's owner's death, And scarce outlives cotemporary breath. With eastern flowers, to strew their path of life, Fame, luxury, gold, maintain a friendly strife; But they bequeathe no strong, immortal verse; And hence their fame droops pallid o'er their herse. Poets, a more august, and sacred name, Their art, our glory, and their fate, our shame, Bear, and anticipate, a different doom, In mortal fortune, and beyond the tomb. Those talents which produce the godlike strain, Subject the man to poverty, and pain; Mean labours his ethereal fire controul; And want unnerves his energy of soul. Whenever God, for his mysterious ends, Pressed with all evils, destitute of friends, Presents a Chatterton to human view, The Devil conjures up a Walpole too. Yet well they know, ere glory's wreath is won, And far from Orford's more unfeeling son, Through glades Elysian ere their spirits rove, Or through the fragrance of the laurel grove; Full well they know (the presage heals their woes) That even on earth their fame eternal flows; That their existence was by heaven designed To give the distant sons of human kind The brightest emanations of the mind. A splendid object, full in fancy's view, On bards and actors my reflexions drew; Candour my verse digressive will forgive; They write correctly who securely live; The poet, from his theme before he strayed, For Siddons had invoked the muse's aid. His liberal strain requests the publick ear, Not with presumption, nor fictitious fear. Talents pre-eminent are sure to find From him the verdict of an honest mind; He wishes that the laurel still may bloom Round the right brow, and round the sacred tomb; Admires, with ardour, each illustrious name; Himself, through all his soul, alive to fame. Siddons! bright subject for a poet's page! Born to augment the glory of the stage! Our soul of tragedy restored I see; A Garrick's genius is renewed in thee. To give our nature all it's glorious course; With moral beauty, with resistless force, To call forth all the passions of the mind, The good, the brave, the vengeful, the refined; The sigh, the thrill, the start, the angel's tear; Thy Isabella is our Garrick's Lear. 'Tis not the beauties of thy form alone, Thy graceful motion, thy impassioned tone; Thy charming attitudes, thy magic pause, That speaks the eloquence of nature's laws; Not these have given thee high theatrick fame, Nor fired the muse to celebrate thy name. When Thomson's epithets, to nature true, Recall her brightest glories to my view; Whene'er his mind-illumined aspect brings The look that speaks unutterable things; In fancy, then, thy image I shall see; Then, heavenly artist, I shall think on thee! Whatever passion animates thine eye; Thence, whether pity steals, or terrours fly; Or heaven commands, to fix a verse benign, With power miraculous, thy face to shine; Whatever feeling 'tis thy aim to move, Fear, vengeance, hate, benevolence, or love; Still do thy looks usurp divine controul, And on their objects rivet all the soul: Thy lightning far outstrips the poet's race; Even Otway's numbers yield to Siddons' face. Long after thou hast closed the glowing scene; Withdrawn thy killing, or transporting mien; Humanely hast removed from mortal sight, Those eyes that shed insufferable light; Effects continue, rarely seen before; The tumult of the passions is not o'er; Imagined miseries we still deplore: We see a few (oh! England's pride, and shame! But 'tis where Picq, and Vestris have a name!) Who still are clinging to the tale of woe, Aud give, without reserve, their tears to flow; Still thy strong pathos works the generous heart; Still, still we grieve, and cannot think it art. Even yet distress on meditation grows; Even yet I feel all Isabella's woes; The dreadful thoughts, raised by the magick ring, With all her agonies my bosom sting; I feel, where Biron ascertains his life, All the severe amazement of the wife: When she, by force, from his remains is borne, Myself by ruffians, from myself am torne; Where the keen dagger gives her soul relief, Frees her from frenzy, and o'erwhelming grief; At vain compassion, with her latest breath, I laugh, and triumph in fictitious death. The poet, born with elegant desires, Born to diffuse, in ease, the muse's fires; Inspired by thee, forgets his rigorous doom, In fate's long winter feels his genius bloom; Forgets each taint that checks his growing bays, Avowed hostilities, or frugal praise; Nor can grim poverty his warmth restrain; The squalid spectre threats his gripe in vain. On other heroines is attention hung; In them, we're charmed with a mellifluous tongue; All action's grace, in them, our eyes admire; Yet, with these powers, from genius we require Thy rare prerogative, resistless fire. More gentle arts the calm spectator views; Their softer pleasure soothes: but fire subdues; This, in a moment, thrilling through the frame, Makes voluntary victims to it's flame: Of common motion scorns the laws assigned; To Thebes, or Athens, whirls the ravished mind; Sends it's contending passions from the stage, And racks us with ambition, grief, or rage. This magick property, this fire divine, Pours heaven's own lightning through the poet's line. This Hayley wants; and hence his golden lays A respite give us; give us breath to praise. But when great Dryden flies along his plain, And gives his foaming Pegasus the rein, We fight old battles, and we slay the slain. This fire diffused it's warmth when Milton sung; And sways the soul, in Siddons, and in Younge. Celestial property! at thy display, How feebler lustre fades, and dies away! Thus, if we recollect Blandusia's stream, Of Horace, once, the sportive, rural theme; It's grot, it's trees, it's murmurs we admire, And in our bosom feel Arcadian fire. Next, should our fancy o'er the Atlantick stray, Where nobler objects wake a bolder lay; Where Orellana, from his mighty source, Holds a magnificent, stupendous course; And borne through many a far-extended plain, Repels the jealous, and reluctant main; Small images, indignant, we discard; We lose the fountain; nay we lose the bard; The mind expands; it's genius sweeps along; And pours it's fervour in congenial song. Or, thus, if Mason's page a poet reads; Sports among dews, and trees, and flowers, and meads; The mind, too candid to the florid strain, Expects emotion, but expects, in vain. But, if to raise imagination's force, He seeks, in Homer's muse, a sure resource; Perhaps, where Priam his grave council calls, And Helen moves divinely on the walls; While Troy's astonished youth new raptures prove, And age grows tender to the faults of love; The modern bard imbibes the Grecian fires, To the sublime, and beautiful aspires; He emulates, in thought, Homerick lays, And boldly meditates a Devon's praise. A POETICAL EPISTLE TO SIR ASHTON LEVER. Nostris acerbissimis doloribus, variisque, et undique circumfusis molestiis, alia nulla potuit inveniri Levatio. Cicero's Conclusion of his Tusculan Questions. A strange, unfashionable modern muse, Who, with charmed eye the works of nature views; Still fond to walk in her eternal road, And still despising perishable mode; No flatterer of the great, nor of the vain, To Lever wakes her tributary strain. Whilst others make mankind their easy prey; Of folly, and of vice, extend the sway; Some new incentives plan, to loose desire; Or stimulate the gamester's desperate fire; A war with sense, to please the coxcomb, wage; And dupe him with a vile Italian stage; Lever expands creation's mighty roll; Suggests our Maker to the languid soul; Kindles, in torpid breasts, a generous flame; And bids us glow with virtue, or with shame. In order fair, we view, disposed by thee, Inhabitants of earth, and air, and sea; The various wonders of our globe explore, From Siam's realm, to California's shore; From where Magellan's thundering billows roll, To the fixed winter of the northern pole. Ye, who, with impious pride, contemn that law, Meant, from our lives the best effects to draw; That law, which Milton's heaven-taught genius fired, Which Locke's, and Newton's thoughts, and acts inspired; Ye, who impute disorder of the brain To those who worship in a Christian fane; For once, reject your light, and glittering toys; For once, emerging into men, from boys, Of thought and sentiment, the pleasures try; No earthly gain can with their blessings vie; Perhaps they'll teach you how to live, and die. Repair to Lever's temple, and adore; And blush, and shudder, and be fools no more. To mar your piety, you'll find, at least, No wanton organ, and no drawling priest. Thither, with me, you condescend to go; I'm confident you love what makes a show. We, surely, tread on consecrated ground; How nature's Author strikes us, all around! I feel profaneness in each idle sound! 'Tis God who speaks: will you refuse to hear? Nay, he reproves; will you not learn to fear? Ye, who can only essences inhale; Who shrink, and tremble, at the frosty gale; Will you not dread that Being, who presides O'er the wind's force, and o'er the swelling tides; Who shakes with earthquakes, now, some guilty shore, Now bids his thunder, now, Vesuvius, roar! Yet, generous Lever! in our leaden days, All thy reward may prove, the poet's praise! For, thy magnificent and varied store, Which gives to science views unknown before; Which more unfolds the worlds harmonious plan, The mind eternal, and the mind of man (It's master, in some inauspicious hour, Meanly by wealth deserted, and by power) Like Houghton's monuments of art, may go To find a patroness in Russian snow; May be received (since taste is, here, no more) With genial ardour on a frozen shore. And yet, there was a more propitious time, Ere knowledge, vigorous, once, in England's clime Had all it's honours lost, and all it's prime; Ere luxury, more general, and refined, And venal baseness, quite enslaved the mind; Gave all a Dæmon's rage to low desire, And quenched the fainting sparks of generous fire; When English liberality was shown To ores, and spars, and butterflies of Sloane. Ye Fair! the pride of celebrated isles! What power is in your frowns, and in your smiles, I need not say: you may retard our doom; And bid, again, a nation's virtue bloom. When great Lycurgus formed the Spartan state, As fixed by him, impregnable to fate; His rough Laconian sons were taught to feel No ardour, like the love of publick weal: They sought no foes; they owned no haughty Lord; And only for their country drew their sword: Then were they nobly prodigal of breath; And all their wish was, Liberty, or Death. Through either sex the brave infection ran; They all pursued their legislator's plan. Ere a young Spartan soldier took the field, His mother brought him forth the sacred shield; And said;—“Let this, from thee, by none be torne; “Bear home thy shield; or on thy shield be borne.” He felt the precept throb in every vein: He conquered; or was numbered with the slain. To England's fair, the poet recommends Means more adventurous, aimed at distant ends. But, ever, to the great, and arduous deed, Peculiar honour is the destined meed. The task auspicious of the Spartan dame, Was, but to speed the course of virtue's flame; Yours is the task, when all her power is fled, To bid her warmth re-animate the dead; To aid the weaker influence of my pen; And to substantiate shadows into men; Shadows of those, who conquered in the fray, At Cressy's, Agincourt's, and Blenheim's day. Yet let not hope on your bright aspects lower; Scarce is a miracle beyond your power. Prescribe us, by your exemplary lives, As tender mothers, faithful, generous wives, The moral excellence we must pursue, If we aspire to be approved by you. On you those sentiments kind Heaven bestowed, Which urge us on, in glory's thorny road; Then, let them, by exertion, be refined; And into culture shame each dozing mind. Chuse fine amusements; let them not be vain; And oft, at Lever's, join the sober train; The female form, august; the female mien, Inspired by thought, will dignify the scene. Still, in your minds, let judgment hold her seat; Scorn an Italian trill; a Frenchman's feet: Still, let the path to happiness be trod; And give your hours to Nature, and to God. Our living race the Tarentines renew; Or softer Sybarites, in them, we view. By principle they never will be led To emulate the glory of the dead. Of English manners, then, ye English Fair, To give reforming models, be your care. Let, from your influence, our improvement flow; Extort from love, what we to reason owe; And since neglectful of her card we sail, Let us to virtue steer, by passion's gale. AN ELEGY ON THE DEATH OF A YOUNG OFFICER OF THE ARMY. Born, with the virtues of maturer age, To warm the poet's, or historian's page; Born, life's best deeds, and best rewards to prove, To merit friendship, and to merit love; Born with that fire, by which, of old, was hurled Britannia's thunder on a hostile world: But all this worth, just opening into bloom, Is closed, for ever, by the ruthless tomb. Severely for my heart, too soon a shade, Accept this tribute, from affection payed; Well-pleased accept it; for the poet's verse, More than funereal pomp adorns the herse; Gives us, at once, improvement, and relief; Refines our morals, while it soothes our grief; While it commands our tears afresh to flow, Indulging soft, and salutary woe. Forming the numbers to thy memory due, The frowns of fortune unappalled I view; For never could the wanton tyrant's reign Extinguish, in my breast, the liberal strain; Ne'er cool my ardour for a poet's name, By her gay fops of fashionable fame; Ne'er sink my heart beneath it's noblest ends; To honour living, or departed friends. And let not the severe, ye martial train, Tell me my grief is weak, and flows in vain! Oh! let the short-lived joys, and hopes of youth, Impress you, ever, with important truth! Since life is short, with virtue fill the span; The habits of the youth decide the man. The good from fate their deathless graces save, And are mature, though minors, for the grave. And oft to pleasure's gay, luxuriant bower, Contrast the dark, irrevocable hour; Which, haply, gives you, long, the golden light, Or adds it's gloom to the returning night. For not alone, on Mars's purple field, The sons of war their generous spirits yield; Death still attends us, on whatever ground; Lurks in our frame, and hovers all around: Oft, even the light, elastic spring of life, With life's duration is at fatal strife: We draw our dissolution with our breath; Our vital air impregnated with death; And thus as surely by an atom fall, As by the Culverin's destructive ball. Ambitious of no mean effects, my muse Extends to either world her moral views: Then may these lays, enforcing human weal, Firmly to act, and tenderly to feel; To my friend's memory, to our species kind, Still move the heart, and still impell the mind; With sympathy producing virtue, read, Preserve the living, and embalm the dead. THE INVINCIBLE ISLAND; A POEM: WITH INTRODUCTORY OBSERVATIONS ON THE PRESENT WAR. The Douglas, and the Hotspur, both together, Are confident against the world in arms. Shakespeare. 1797. Can all the mind's fertility pourtray Man's pride, and madness, on some future day! France, governed long by absolute command; Formed to convulse, but not to rule a land; France, that hath left no path of crimes untrod; Foe to all virtue; even at war with God! Whom slaves, before, whom tyrants, now, we find; (The natural progress of the human mind!) France, (have I lived these monstrous times to see!) France is to teach Britannia to be free! Island of bliss! renowned for laurels won Accept this ardent service of thy son! While at this awfully momentous time; Alike unparalleled in prose, and rhyme, Others with civick wreaths crown every hour, More blessed with wealth, or strengthened more with power; Poets can only add a sprig of bay; Poets can only give their zealous lay! Oh! were my muse as warm as my desires; Were her flame equal to my patriot fires; Fine coruscations, darting from my page, Haply might stimulate the generous rage That glows in every British, free-born soul; While Gallia threats her insolent controul! Jealous of Liberty's, of Glory's plan, Must we be victims to those apes of man! Never!—All Englishmen their Shakespeare know; To bards 'tis given in prophecy to flow; Shakespeare, the jest of every Gallick fool; Echoes of Ferney's superficial school; Who think all genius by their own surpassed; Whose verse is rhyme; whose eloquence, bombast:— England her Shakespeare knows; but what says he? Like brethren let our island but agree; The dauntless Hotspur, and the Douglas, joined, In unison of wealth; of heart; of mind; Will win the god who drives the crimson car; And wage against the world successful war. Then by the gallant Scottish ghosts I swear, Blessed with the fragrance of Elysian air; Who rushed impetuous on the patriot's doom; Repelling from their land ambitious Rome! Nay (for no obstinate, mean hate, I know, To union summoned by the common foe) I swear by those who fell at Flodden's field; With hearts that knew to conquer, not to yield; And by our English ghosts; the glorious dead; Who at famed Agincourt, and Cressy, bled; If we obey the maxim of our seer; A poet; prophet; politician, here; Life's current still shall prove, in British blood, Of valour an insuperable flood; Still other Marlboroughs; other Wolfes shall rise; To glad a nation's hearts; a nation's eyes; Again their thunder, with just vengeance, hurled, By land, shall crush the robbers of the world; While Hawkes, and Howes; and Duncans, on the main, Impurple Neptune's realm with Frenchmen slain: With murmur flits each melancholy ghost; Cursing it's dreams of treading England's coast. But while my mind approves; admires; reveres The hand intrepid that our vessel steers; Not with French rant; with English firmness braves Meteors of anarchy, and faction's waves; While I revere each patron of the state; Let me not class too low the poet's fate. Poets give grace, and energy to mind; And speed the noble passions of mankind. Pindar in Theban bosoms lighted flames, To pant for glory at Olympia's games; And to deserve their country's beauteous dames. The bard, Tyrtæus, with his patriot song, Raised from despair the listening Spartan throng; Taught their chilled hearts with ancient heat to glow; And drove their arms, in thunder, on the foe. For his first pleasure of nocturnal hours, Young Ammon, blest with ardent mental powers, Close to his conquering sword the Iliad laid, Invoking Homer's venerable shade: The god-like strain he read with sleepless eyes; And fired his soul with verse, to great emprize. Oh! then, might Dryden's muse my numbers fire; His easy force; his eloquence inspire; Give all his fervour to my vigorous line; “His long, majestick march, and energy divine Pope.;” Which multiplied Britannia's naval balls; And drove them home, through Holland's oaken walls; Or would our Pope's more cultivated muse; Whose graceful robe floats with celestial hues; Tune in my ravished ears his golden strain, That urged our cannon on the pride of Spain; By powers poetick I might, then, regain A loyal phalanx from Sedition's train; Those powers would clear their intellectual sight From democratick fogs of Stygian night:— Yes; loyal to the code of publick sway, Praised in the sage's prose; the poet's lay; That equal code which Montesquieu admires; Which warms Helvetius with the purest fires. Blest pair! while two such Frenchmen plead our cause, How England feels her salutary laws! Your country's glory, while she valued fame; Now, in her Scythian state, your country's shame! Would but one spirit of the mighty dead His heat benign on his admirer shed; Would Burke, who gave us poetry in prose, While strength of argument collateral flows: With great suggestions fill my poorer breast; 'Twould then, with glorious agitation blest, Congenial sense, and imagery produce, Of private rapture, and of publick use.— Transfuse his fervid æther to my line; The coyness I could bear of all the Nine. Oh! come, to man disposed for ever well; People with Plato's forms my lonely cell; Those forms, in eloquence by thee conveyed; In thy mellifluous style, celestial shade! A splendid world of poetry would show; And with more musick teach my verse to flow; Come, then; to letters warmly still inclined; Enrich my fancy, and inform my mind! When freed from low pursuits, our minds attend; Each moral poet is his country's friend: 'Tis true, the precepts glide: they softly steal, But surely, to the mass of publick weal, The favourites of the muse, with fine controul; With force delightful, draw the captive soul; Suffuse all moral truth with charming grace; And push the virtues of the human race; Their own they push; intent on high renown, They feel not, while the Nine their temples crown, Envy's mean arts, nor Pride's presumptuous frown. Would Heaven's omnipotence on me bestow Those powers which in poetick story flow; Which fiery souls could with it's magick tame; And change the passions of the human frame; Then should my country soon possess, combined, All her dread force of matter, and of mind: To matter, powerless to destroy, or save; “The womb of Nature, and perhaps her grave Milton.;” All act; all energy, by mind is given; That emanation from the throne of heaven! Our earth were dead; our sun; our days; our years; Unless a God for ever wheeled the spheres; Then let two god-like minds no longer jar; But drive, in harmony, the storm of war! When Eloquence's bright, resistless flood, Shall roll, united, for your country's good; When she shall hear you plead her urgent cause, With ardent concord, of endangered laws; Of property; of life; of all that's dear; Of all that moves the smile; or draws the tear; The force electrick shall pervade our isle; The queen of nations shall resume her smile:— Hear;—by the miser's vote the war supplied; See! cowards pant to die as Burgess died! Who can each powerful stimulus withstand; When Robbers threaten; and when you command? Well pleased, though prostrate, falls poetick pride; By Oratory's pathos far outvied:— But let my verse with stronger interest flow;— By your exertions prostrate falls the foe! Of all the talents that from heaven we share, We find the first-rate orator's most rare. In ancient times, two commonwealths were blest, Each, with one genius, of these powers possessed; The first, in Athens, lengthened Freedom's date; Her drooping life, in a degenerate state: The next (great victim to a tyrant's doom!) Repelled destruction from majestick Rome!— Two first-rate orators in Britain live; (Such glories can her constitution give!)— If, then, in former governments, one sage, By Hermes fired, could vanquish hostile rage; Sure, two such patriots may preserve our own; Secure our senate, and protect our throne. Thou orator! whose praise would speed my muse! Her numbers polish, and expand her views; Whose social character I love; whose fire, Pregnant with splendid genius, I admire! Forgive the liberal poet, who presumes (His muse, with awe, contracts her burnished plumes!) On ground political to move with thee; But this great crisis bids us all be free. Would Fox for a wild horde of Tartars plead; Who still for freedom is prepared to bleed? All masks those savages have Thrown away; Have now announced themselves in open day. Peace they despise; their trade is to annoy; Deceit, and insult, are a Frenchman's joy! To an old proverb Punic faith gave birth; French faith be now the proverb, o'er the earth: 'Tis true, that faith was of notorious fame, When all it's realms adored a monarch's name; But then their court politely broke it's word; Like gentlemen, whose honour is their sword: But now the low mechanics of the land; Those chieftains, “of exceeding good command An expression of Shakespeare.;” Unmoved with shame, advance the grossest lie; Callous to refutation's calm reply; Or with some bold affront it's force defy: Assume their kindred rabble's brutal airs; And almost kick ambassadours down stairs. Oh! cruel task, by Providence assigned, To try a learned, polished, candid mind; That mind opposed by artificial spheres, To ignorance, and insolence;—its peers! May Malmesbury deign attention to my lays; And from no venal pen accept his praise! Let from the scholar's mind a tribute flow; And as a Briton take the thanks I owe. Oft with thy In this passage I allude to the works of the late celebrated James Harris, Esq. of Salisbury; which I studied with great pleasure; and which are highly, and equally distinguished by their learning; their elegance; and their zeal for virtue. father my enamoured youth Wooed, in his groves Athenian, beauteous Truth: And as his comment on my spirit wrought, The Stagyrite more clearly met my thought: The more I loved what god-like Plato taught. While thus I reasoned with the good, and wise, Phœbus, in June, too early left the skies! The son is worthy to succeed the sire; Thine is his virtue; thine his Attic fire; Born to contrast thyself, in wayward times, With dire abettors of all human crimes; Born, as a British delegate, to show How far ingenuous dignity can go; While by the French transactions was expressed What baseness can pollute the human breast. These are the pygmies, who, all-good, all-wise, In their vain fancy, to old Romans rise; These are the generous fathers of mankind, Who promise that by some propitious wind, Their Heaven-sent fleets our coasts, ere long, shall see;— They land; they conquer; and they make us free! Who would not laugh, this impious boast to hear; Did not it's impious nonsense wound our ear? Say, since your monarch's death, ye vaunting elves, What liberty have you enjoyed, yourselves? Now, nine long years in acting madly wrong (Various, and dire events have made them long!) You've passed: thus, from your revolution's date, Crimes heaped on crimes have driven your headlong fate. Those years what deeds of genuine glory grace? Bombast, and blood, and rapine fill the space! Eager, abroad, your neighbour's rights to seize; At home, to trample on your own decrees; Confusion on confusion you have hurled; The Pandæmonium of our upper world! Not polity's mere elements you know; Of order ignorant; to it's bliss a foe! Tell me:—with intellectual vision strong; While a blind chaos whirls your state so long;— Tell me; with tranquil study have you seen, What Locke, what Montesquieu, what Sydney mean? Have you the paths to the best science trod; By which a man participates his God? Have you implored that God to dart a beam, To light you through the complicated theme? That mighty theme, whose blessings, as they flow, Cheer, and exalt our being here below; The theme that spreads fair plenty o'er a land; While just obedience bows to just command; That cheers the husband's labour; charms the wife; And throws Elysium round connubial life; That, brought to action, fires all minds; all hearts; Stirs all great passions; urges all fine arts; To love of country, and to glory, wakes The souls of Duncans, as the souls of Drakes; Excites the bard to energetick lays; His dearest recompence, that country's praise: Brings matchless orators to splendid day; Gives Pitt's, and Fox's genius, all their play! That theme; that constitution, at this hour, (Blest influence of her large, pervading power!) That theme; that constitution now invites, Intreats her Fox to plead her sacred rights; She hopes, in the palladium of his mind, For safety from the refuse of mankind; Woos him his less ambition to forego; And pour his greater on the common foe; To grasp, in friendship, England's whole expanse; To feel nought hostile to his peace but France; His British brother-lion proud to join; And add new lustre to the fearless line: She woos him still to earn more high renown; More vivid foliage for the patriot's crown. Sage policy! how powerful is it's plan! To his last excellence it brightens man! It's complex operations steal along; In silence, active; in gradation strong; For ever verging to their parent-goal; Their god-like aim; the welfare of the whole! Ye stupid atheists! moves this fine machine In your tumultuous, sanguinary scene? Make you it's laws your knowledge, or your care? Murderers of all that's good, and wise, and fair! Your nation with the farce of kingly power At first you mocked; poor phantom of an hour; No proper pressure to that King you gave, In the state's weight;—a mere conspicuous slave! Statesmen unparalleled through every age! Shall all your crudities disgrace my page? Councils; conventions; and assemblies loud; Each, a mechanick, upstart, bawling crowd! Directories, more grave, and famous far; Great in their nervous arguments for war; Let me but skim these monsters in my strains; The shapeless progeny of moon-struck brains. No railing, this; men of discerning eye Blunders in all your plans at once descry! You work on no strong base; your fabricks all, As soon as reared, are tottering to their fall; Soon (for no part supports; no part coheres) They sink, and crash, and thunder round your ears. From all the practice of your motley sway, Your civil justice bears the palm away. When honest lawyers, whom all tyrants hate, Pled for their clients, doomed to lawless fate; When by your orders; by your forms they pled; Anticipating vengeance marked them dead; Your justice, like your axe, a mere machine; And both were sentenced to the guillotine! But now their genius finds a stranger mode; Their penal statutes take a longer road. Now, with the Deity these judges vie; Now, with intuitive omniscient eye, They see the traitor;—in ethereal minds, A dull, cold process no admission finds; Power self-derived; power self-informed commands; And off he sails to Afric's burning sands. This is Morocco's comprehensive plan;— A model of the Algerine divan. These men have promised, on some genial day, To cheer our darkened isle with Freedom's ray; Transcendent merit passed our own to make; And spare our nation for their Newton's sake. Oh! hallowed, long; oh! venerable name! Art thou dishonoured by injurious fame! Thy name should strike those fiends with silent awe; Saint of Religion's; priest of Nature's law! Yet to these wretches must we go to school, To learn to flourish under equal rule! Need I say more?—If more I had to say, My English feelings would impede it's way! Let these incentives, Fox, have all their force; And shape, magnanimous, by them, thy course; Give ill-timed An unfair, or superficial reasoner may tell me, that Mr. Fox has relinquished opposition to the Minister, by seceding from Parliament. To this I reply, that we may be industrious to defeat a rival in many ways besides that of immediate, personal contest;—that negative often operate more powerfully than positive hostilities;—that they should never be adopted by great minds, because they are the common warfare of the meanest;—and that as I highly respect Mr. Fox, I can never reflect on his retreat from his senatorial station, at this time, without pain. opposition to the wind; And leave all party-spirit far behind. Who would not act what millions will approve? What gains it's author universal love? Who would not, with ambition fraught, aspire To conduct which the coldest hearts admire? Think of the summit of immortal fame; And think of each illustrious English name! Perhaps, of Britain some departed friend, At times; may, now, thy silent thoughts attend; Suggest that when the brightest glory calls, In the great soul, self-love defeated, falls; That such a soul, clogged with no gross allay, Wings it's direct, and elevated way! Let If Charles the First was a tyrant (though I believe that he never meant to be a tyrant) we now have thousands of tyrants to oppose. Hamden's whisper prompt the generous deed; Let Sydney's hint illumine Virtue's meed; And let not Russel's aspect tinge thy dreams With clouds of sorrow, but with heavenly gleams! By minds of no deep thought, we all have heard A proposition hastily averred; That as the postdiluvian race of men Sink to the grave, at threescore years and ten; Rise, flourish, and decay; then yield their breath; Such is of empires, too, the life, and death: They, in their infancy, and youth, proceed, With every arduous; every glorious deed: Matured, with great, and rival states, they vie:— Commerce, and luxury spread; they droop; they die. This doctrine will not bear the test of truth; A state may hold interminable youth; That state, unlimited in age mature, Against the worst events may prove secure: Frail man is made of one compacted frame; And soon the grave must have it's awful claim: But empires long may ward their fatal date; Long may succeeding lives protract their fate. Think what depends on one illustrious life: Think how the Theban, with his martial strife; With all his virtues, all his talents, blessed; Sprung, like an eagle, for his Thebes distressed; Like Jove's own lightning, darted on his prey; And Greece's palm imperial bore away! But when divine Epaminondas died, His matchless worth no equal chief supplied; Withered, at once, was all his country's bloom; And Thebes, and he, were buried in one tomb. Great orators will die; great heroes bleed; New heroes, and new orators succeed; Apparent ruin at mankind is hurled: Some Atlas rises, and he props the world! So Pitts, and Foxes, strong in virtuous will, The spheres of our best ancestors may fill; May join the factious to their country's friends; And as the social mass harmonious blends, May breathe a flame impetuous through the whole; And make a people, one, all-conquering soul. Then, by the pressing evils of the times; Their indolence; corruption; luxury; crimes; Slightly the purer passion is annoyed; By it's afflatus is the nation buoyed; It's heat these noxious vapours clears away; As clouds disperse before the god of day. Thus the Creator! thus the Lord of all, Impresses, ever, and preserves our ball; Mens agitat molem; et toto se corpore miscet. —Virgil.Works plastick nature, through her varied range; And stimulates her powers, at every change; Bids them their acts essential still maintain; And deluges, and earthquakes rage in vain. Mute be the croaking prophets of the day; Creating danger; raising vain dismay, Whene'er a speck of publick ill appears;— French, in their hopes; or female, in their fears! As on it's solid base our empire stands; And all it's forces I here anticipate the cavil, and the puny triumph of democratical ignorance. So long as any state can provide the necessary supplies of war, and, at the same time, preserve it's national health and vigour; the forces of that state are unimpaired. unimpaired commands; Let us, if we peruse grave history's page, To dignify this world's inferior stage, Adopt examples from a better age. While yet unshaken, let us learn from Rome Of ancient fame, to spurn a servile doom; Or should our sea-girt isle her danger share; Her let us emulate, and spurn despair. True to itself, the greatly conscious soul No petty smiles, nor petty frowns controul; When the worst ills assail, it's conflicts rise; From firmness, and the justice of the skies, It still anticipates complete relief, In all the majesty of Roman grief. When dreadful Annibal; stupendous foe! Fearless of Alpine heights; of Alpine snow; Those heights had passed; he poured, along the plains, A furious tide of war on Rome's domains! Genius; the love of fame; of Rome the hate, Wrought all the splendour of this hero's fate. No bounds to glorious deeds hath heaven assigned, When three such powerful engines move the mind. First at Ticinum were his rapid arms Victorious; and through Latium spread alarms; The frighted river rolled a purple flood; Great Po, with horrour, felt the generous blood. Still Afric's lion the proud eagle tore, And Trebia's stream was red with Roman gore. Almost with filial grief the classick muse The lake, the hills of Trasimenus views! Livy.Patavium's glory: how, thy page divine Makes Roman valour in misfortune shine! Nature, with squalid mien, predicts the fray; She sends a gloomy, dank, and weeping day; The realms of Italy with earthquakes reel; Which all but the contending armies feel; Divine, and human rage, at once are hurled; And Jove, and Annibal divide the world. Sickly, through Nature's horrours, gleams the sun; Carnage completes the scene which they begun. Of common minds the fortitude is less, As deeper swells the climax of distress; Not so the Romans; even to Cannæ's field Their unsubmitting spirit scorned to yield. A heavier chain of woes can history tell?— At Cannæ fifty thousand Romans fell! The rapid Aufidus was near the plain; The melancholy tidings of the slain He rolled, in blood Patrician, to the main! How imminent was, now, the Roman doom! The conqueror, but an easy march from Rome! And what a conqueror! say, can history show So great a people matched with such a foe? Curse on my lays, if ever they refuse Praise to the man who shades my favourite views; In whom the world admires the real charms Of genius, or in letters, or in arms; If, though conspicuous gallantry prevail, I tell De Winter's cold, Dutch, envious tale! But the French Corsican will France oppose, Though wild her gasconading rhetorick flows, With feeble modern Italy o'errun; Nay, with his trophies even from Austria won;— Will she oppose him to Amilcar's son? Let me, with ardour, following glory's call, View Rome's consummate greatness in her fall. When from his favourites Jove awhile withdrew; And turned to Carthage, with propitious view; Evils oppressed; but still the Roman rose; Humane, in triumphs, and august, in woes: When Cannæ's field to fresh alarms gave birth; And shook those energies that shook the earth; When plans were offered, in a warm debate, Unequal to the high decrees of fate; To court renown, like sons of Rome, no more; To breathe ignobly, on some foreign shore; The youthful Scipio drew his flaming sword; Worthy companion of each fiery word! The destined saviour of his country swore By Jove, who had protected Rome before, That all who heard him should resist the foe; That valour still might ward the fatal blow; That strength, and honour were reserved for Rome, Of long duration; of perpetual bloom: “If one man here shrinks from his country's good, “My vengeful blade shall seek the dastard's blood!” His oath with patriot hearts his audience feel; Awed less by Annibal's than Scipio's steel. But not alone thus acted Scipio's soul; The same intrepid thoughts inspired the whole. When Varro to the capital returned; Whose valour had with warmth destructive burned; All orders in procession met the chief; Eager to pour into his mind relief; Thanked him for bravely bearing Fate's harsh doom; “For not despairing of imperial Rome!” What was the consequence?—Rome's empire rose On the vast ruins of her Punic foes; Great deeds achieved; and greater still designed; For pressure but new-springs the generous mind; As gold by Vulcan's torture is refined. Even in the fiercest war is Britain blessed; With no destructive ravages distressed; Even now her sons are not compelled to cease The sweet employments, and the joys of peace: Environed with tranquillity, the swain Rears the new hay; and reaps the golden grain; Commerce with usual vigour spreads her sails; And England's fortune sends auspicious gales; From human bliss no sounds discordant jar, But faction's clamour, with it's wordy war. What most we value; property; law; life; From all the horrours of the martial strife, Nature, and man, alike, with us defend; —Their generous efforts let us all befriend. No Buonapartes in our isle shall rage; No dreadful Punic war have we to wage; The god of ocean ever guards our shore; His waves, and our victorious cannon roar; Still we possess our old internal powers; And English wealth, and hearts, and hands are ours. Then let each honest man dismiss his fears; Let every timorous woman dry her tears: And you, domestick enemies, who spread, With souls malignant, artificial dread; Let phantoms court you to some foreign strand; And quit, too good for you, your native land. When France imperial dignity maintained; When Louis' fortune, and her Colbert reigned; When female charms, and female wit inspired; And all that splendour with their ether fired; Her threats; her force, if we could then disdain; Of France degenerate shall we bear the chain? Shall we, to English fame no longer true, Stoop to a vile, marauding, ruffian crew? Shall English talents their protection owe To De la Croix; to Monge, and to Lepaux? Shall Gallia's hireling chief these realms command; Dissolve our senate, and Their civil, are analagous to their penal laws. Buonaparte, who is a general, affects to be a statesman, too, without a particle of political knowledge; indeed, all that he writes, is in the peremptory, ostentatious, empty manner of that nation of which he has the honour to be the first lawless myrmidon. He advises his Ligurian republick to divide their state into ten military departments; each of them is to be commanded by an officer of the line: by this institution, adds the Solon of France, you will be sure of an accurate administration of justice. I hope that this Corsican Draco will never have it in his power to establish his simple, concise, and salutary code, in England. divide our land? Is any price enormous that we pay To quell the tempest of chaotick sway? No;—if at ease we draw not British breath; We'll court a glorious poverty, or death There are incentives in the roll of fate; Which, in collision with a mighty state, Would so strike fire;—such talents would shoot forth; Such emulation; such exerted worth; That were it's constitution in decline; With all it's ancient lustre it would shine. My country! justly every Briton's pride; Where Freedom still is anxious to reside; Because, constrained from other lands to flee, She found her walls of adamant in thee! Great patroness of man's eternal cause; His mild religion, and his equal laws! From distant ages Providence's care; Parent of gallant sons, and daughters fair! Where, in the cultivated rural scene, Ceres and Flora wear their brightest mien! And where, in social elegance are joined The charms of person, and the charms of mind: Of sage philosophers a numerous train; Of men most powerful in poetick strain! Should human excellence our search engage, In recollecting down, from age to age; While memory travels, too, from pole to pole; The first achievements of the human soul, Great Queen of Islands, we shall find in thee; This is by no means applicable to the present times. I except our glory at sea. 1810Divine at land, and terrible at sea! Since Europe, now, her arbitress reveres; And looks to thee, with mingled hopes, and fears; Of all the deeds that British annals praise, From virtuous Alfred's down to George's days; When thou must act the most distinguished part; When all thy glories press upon my heart; When with emphatick voice thy honour calls; Accept the verse that flows; the tear that falls! Sons of the men, whom times remoter saw Their conquering swords against oppression draw; With hearts elate, and steady march advance, To the pale lilies of their trembling France; Oft taught to bleed; but never taught to fly; Resolve, once more, to conquer, or to die! Oh! give not peerless beauty; strongest mind, To the declared assassins of mankind! Make no mean peace with monsters that retain Nought faithful; nought religious; nought humane: Against our universe their threats are hurled; Defend yourselves; and you defend the world! Never desert the man who rules our helm; Whom furious surges cannot overwhelm: Resolved, while trusted with Britannia's weal, For this, alone, to think; for this to feel; This, the great source, and end of all his cares; And still, intrepid, to this point he bears. Revered example more inflames the son, To earn such honours as his father won; Who, haply darts a fond, paternal eye, Sent, with a smile approving, from the sky! For me; while in calm solitude I view Thee, to thyself, on every trial, true; To England true; I feel; or seem to feel, Through all my frame the fine contagion steal; I feel the natural, ardent passion rise, To gain my country's praise; the poet's prize; Next, kindling Fancy views the threatened storm; Then fired by thee, a bolder wish I form; By thy commanding genius borne along, To act in conduct, what I praise, in song! Still magnanimity and candour join; Then surely both the properties are thine: Let not that magnanimity refuse The grateful verse of an ingenious muse; “ This I quoted from Pope's spirited encomium on Lord Oxford.Who shades thy” high, meridian “walk with bays;” “No hireling, she; no prostitute to praise;” “Through” Faction's fog “one truly great can see;” Worthy to rouse the brave; and guide the free. O! Thou! at whose benign, all powerful call, Up sprung, from chaos, our stupendous ball; And who, from tumult, still, of field, or flood, From present ill educest greater good; Propitious, hear thy humble suppliant's prayer; Is not thy creature his Creator's care! Sufficient influence of thy Spirit give; That in the little space I now can live, Each hour I may respect; and thus atone For all my wrongs from others; and my own! Oh! let my common, meaner wants, be few; My mental treasures, various, rich, and new; Then shall my nature for itself suffice; Perpetual flux, and reflux of supplies: Old years in renovated youth shall roll; Well strung my nerves of body and of soul. Temperance my system will exalt, at home; A wanderer, abroad I need not roam; Of a precarious world my life the sport; Tossed on the waves of caprice for support! As Independence, even unarmed with power, Speaks, writes the truth; whatever dangers lower; Snares to it's weal as foes in ambush lay; And poor, pretended Friendship sneaks away; Teach me, by virtuous discipline, to find A comprehensive kingdom, in my In proportion as a created being, in any mode of it's existing, or acting, resembles the Supreme Being; (though, at the best, in an insignificant comparative degree,) the general happiness of that being is augmented, Now, the Supreme Being is pure mind; he is all, mind, mind; There, with serene, yet with despotick reign, To guard the small but well-improved domain! Concentered, then, with more effectual force, My faculties will hold their destined course; Will execute their duties here below; To all thy foes, an active, ardent foe: But mounting above Nature's works, they'll flee Still with the greatest energy, to Thee!

God forbid that I should insinuate that, in the amount of life, it is better to be a poet than a truly wise, and virtuous man. pleasures of the good, and wise; Goodness, and wisdom, too, as he can teach With greater emphasis than Sherlocks preach; Let poetry still bless thy suppliant's views;— It's beauteous images; it's vivid hues; It's fire celestial; all-sufficient store! Kings; emperours; none but Thou, can give us more! And while the grosser lumps of mortals lie, (A living death!) in Epicurus' sty; To ruin's gloom while meteors draw the vain; While Avarice petrifies her shivering train; Grant me, with pure, and strong Parnassian ray, To float, and wanton, in the blaze of day!

Paradise Lost, B. vii. v. 27. TO THE REV. WILLIAM BEVILLE. TO EDMUND WALLER, ESQ. Of Hall-Barn, in Buckinghamshire, On seeing the tomb of Edmund Waller, the poet, in the Church-yard of Beconsfield, neglected, and going to ruin. Shalt thou from public shame exempt. Thy reverence to this tomb refuse! A Waller, with profane contempt, Dares to insult a Waller's muse! Whom chiefs of the fanatic train Loved, for they felt her purer fire; Whom in our present monarch's reign, The sons of England yet admire; Yet, for the tomb's unequal fate, Our indignation we may spare; The memory of the truly great Depends not on a stupid heir. For canst thou, parricide, destroy The deathless force of Waller's mind? Canst thou his flame, his wit annoy, Which will but die with human kind? The glory of the poet's page Shall brighten still, and still expand, In spite of envy's feeble rage, Or mammon's cold, tenacious hand. Then let that page, inspired by love, And by the muse's hallowed flame, The merit of dead Waller prove, The Poet's character proclaim. The rugged tree, with yellow tinged; The icy monumental stone; The iron oft with rags befringed, With many a noxious weed o'ergrown; While far from chance's blind controul Great Edmund's bays perpetual bloom, Let these describe a wretch's soul, And be the breathing Waller's tomb. Sons of low care, how long, in vain, To you shall useful truth be told? Yet hear once more, the moral strain; You damn yourselves to save your gold. Beconsfield, April 12th, 1778. A SONG. DO great atchievements fire thy breast; Do martial trophies break thy rest? Or laurels of eternal bloom, Like those that hallow Cæsar's tomb? To memory bring the fatal ball, It was not sent from Frederickshall. He was assassinated by a villain who stood near him. 1810.Perhaps not sent from Frederickshall, Which proved the Swede's illustrious fame, An air-balloon, an empty name. Or does the bright poetic muse To nobler glory raise your views? Sagacious malice checks your aim, And poverty repels your flame. When envy with the poet dies, His rapid same through Europe flies; But 'tis to genius, after death, An air-balloon, an empty breath. Or fonder of domestic life, The lover weds a charming wife; Anticipates unfading joys, And gentle girls, and sprightly boys; But female tyranny comes forth, And throws aside fictitious worth; The course of one revolving moon May prove your bliss an air-balloon. Through life, what'er our lot, we're all Like Montgolfier's elastic ball; We all attract admiring eyes; The court or village we surprize; Now soar to some ethereal height; Met by rude gales, now sink our flight; To parent earth, at length, descend; The trivial sport, and wonder end. London, Feb. 16th, 1784. THE RIVAL FLOWERS. In the month of November, a young lady had an elegant bouquet; it was composed of a rose and a jasmine. A gentleman, who was in her company, pronounced the flowers artificial. She assured him that they were not; he still doubted; she plucked two or three leaves from the rose' and gave them to him; by them he was convinced that the nosegay was a natural one. This scene, totally uninteresting to a phlegmatic mind, suggested to a poet the following imagery: EVEN partial to a northern clime, Where nature strews her frugal sweets, And smiling on the poet's rhyme, The generous Flora slow retreats. Fair Leonora, dangerous maid, Who reared, and wore, each beauteous flower, Took, one day, for superfluous aid, The rose's and the jasmines's power. Clitander, with adventurous choice, To specious warfare seated nigh, Inhaled soft musick from her voice, Delicious poison from her eye. Cupid, to whom all archers yield, Perched in her breast;—the bright bouquet Before him glowed; and thus concealed, The God in charming ambush lay. Unseen, a small, but piercing dart, Flew from his unrelenting bow; I need not tell you, that the heart Is always reached when he's the foe. Some blushing leaves, transfixed and borne On the dread arrow winged their way; Now, beyond cure, the heart was torne; Compleat the triumph of the day. The fragrant foliage of the rose, But more decisive made the wound; In Kent such foliage never blows, Nor yet on Sharon's holy ground. Unfading flower! the Sibyl's leaves, Fraught with Jove's friendship, or his hate, As every feeling soul believes, Were never charged with surer fate! Oh! dire effect of beauty's pride! As Pope, in his immortal strain Hath sung, the hapless lover died, Entranced, “of aromatick pain!” The God of keenest joys and, woes, Exulting, to Olympus flew; And envious of the honoured rose, The jasmine drooped, and paler grew. Durham. TO MRS. JORDAN. THALIA's pupil! her accomplished friend! Whose genius eager crowds with rapture view; Whom spirit, ease, and harmony attend; Alike to Imogen, to Hoyden true: The faultless powers of the gay muse we prove, In thee, chief guardian of her brilliant throne! In thee, simplicity, and nature move; And Garrick and perfection are thy own. And if the pathos of thy varied art Breathes in a tender interlude of song; How the vibrations of each feeling heart Tuned by thy voice, the liquid notes prolong! Let others vocal art, extent, and tone Applaud, while Mara's undulations roll; My faculties a stronger influence own;— The soft, impassioned musick of the soul. First favourite of the drama's cheerful muse! Her pride, in mirth; in sentiment refined; Whose magick brightens fancy's vivid hues; Accept the tribute of an honest mind. Yet as fair truth by me was ne'er suppressed!— May not self love with honesty agree? Ambition rouzes justice in my breast; And bids me grace my poetry with thee! For taste must ever such a theme inspire; And were it urged with a congenial flame, Not less the subject than the poet's fire Would prove my talents, and ensure my fame. London, June 17, 1793. THE BLUE EYE. Marked you her eye of heavenly blue? Marked you her cheek of roseate hue? That eye in liquid circles moving, That cheek abashed at man's approving: The one, love's arrows darting round; The other, blushing at the wound! IN THE DUENNA. AN ANSWER TO THE ENCOMIUM ON THE BLUE EYE. Faint are your eyes of heavenly blue, While Delia's eyes of jet I view; To those, the colour only given, To these, the fire, and force of heaven: With rapid stroke they reach the heart; They, from their liquid circles dart (More magical their circles prove!) The flame of Cupid, and of Jove. Her cheeks no blushes need betray, That man approving owns her sway; With rose as lenient as benign, Need not regret that lovers pine; To them denied, the leisure hour, To them denied the frigid power, With lightning, and in rapture slain, Or to approve, or to complain, The dread decree they do not wait: Her look is instantaneous fate; They heave not the repeated sigh; Of electricity they die! Windsor Great Park, Nov. 26th, 1793. ? THE FIXED, AND NOBLE MIND TURNS ALL OCCURRENCE TO IT'S OWN ADVANTAGE. Young. The following verses were the ruling object of their authour when he could not move himself, nor be moved, without agony. They were composed by several short exertions of his mind, which were interrupted by debility, or by pain. After this honest apology, they will never incur the frown of generous criticism. VERSES ADDRESSED TO OXFORD. FAIR seat of sages, and of bards divine! Terrestrial residence of all the nine! Oh! had my ardent, and aspiring youth Felt in thy hallowed groves, important truth; Inhaled, in them, the God's inspiring ray; Caught the strong thought, and waked the glowing lay; Then, reason, fancy, happily combined, And tuneful diction, had my verse refined: Then would thy liberal sons have raised my fame; And high above my merit, fixed my name. But now, my life's, my mind's meridian o'er; Poetick vigour, active hope, no more; Thy shades, my faint, my setting fires, receive, Just ere our vital hemisphere they leave. Yet, could I live, one effort more to make, For verse's and for fairer virtue's sake, (Oh! might I fill our ancient province, here; And prove at once, a poet, and a seer!) Haply, some verdict, of decisive praise, Would crown my memory with perpetual bays: Oxford herself might mark my merit's tomb; Restore it's life, and bid it's honours bloom. Thus (for, like Maro's swain, an object small I near a great one place) at Dryden's call, Britons enamoured grew of nature's rules, And spurned the jargon of the doating schools; To genius, and to taste, were converts made; With wonder Milton's vast sublime surveyed; Imbibed seraphick rapture from his page, To glory rescued from a barbarous age. Middleton-Stoney, Oxfordshire, July 10th, 1794. VERSES TO A ROBIN-RED-BREAST, WHO SINGS EVERY MORNING, NEAR MY BED-CHAMBER. SWEET bird; thy music charms my rest; It's warbling soothes my pensive breast. Delighted fancy hears thy song It's artless melody prolong; For oh! when nature strikes the heart, She leaves no trace of Cramer's art. Care, pain, and dire misfortune flee The powers of Morpheus, and of thee; Those powers combined, with soft controul Diffuse Elysium o'er my soul; The sails of persecution furled, I steer to some ideal world; Some finer world, where Zephyr's breeze Panting on aromatick trees, Descends from æther ne'er o'ercast With clouds that hurl the wintry blast. There I repose in fragrant bowers, Where Flora crowns the glowing flowers; Where a meandring, murmuring stream Prompts, and improves the muse's theme: Through shades imagination roves, Which far exceed A country house delightfully situated, near Monmouth. St. Dial's groves; Where a majestick river flows, Disdaining all descriptive prose; His deep, clear floods, the Thames outvie; His playful beauties, even the Wye. In this bright, visionary scene, Our species with angelick mien, And friendly voice, the stranger greet; Their virtues, as their forms, complete: Illusive dream! in which I find That generous actions mark mankind! Since, then, sweet songster of the town, Whose accents bid me sleep on down, With numerous ills thy tuneful strife Dispels their gloom, and gilds my life; When Boreas heaps our world with snow, Come to a heart inured to woe; Hence, quick, when miseries are displayed, To recollect;—to feel;—to aid; With safe, and timely pinion, fly The wild oppression of the sky; Fly to protectors, mild, like thee; Compassion, and tranquillity; Each ruffled, and each flagging plume, With me, their health shall soon resume; Restored from cold, from famine's pain, Shall soon their equal gloss regain: Thy genius we shall soon descry In the new lustre of thine eye: And soon shall thy harmonious throat Pour forth, again, it's liquid note! Who can with hold the generous deed, When innocence, and beauty plead? Then, surely, for thy life, thy weal, A poet ardently must feel! Yes;—he will give thee all thy claim; Present relief; and future fame! Monmouth, Sept. 13th, 1794. [Here lies] The following epitaph I wrote for General WASHINGTON, about three years before the death of that good, and great man; whose talents and virtues I had always respected, and admired. At this moment I extremely regret that the epitaph was so soon as applicable in time as in character. Here lies The only part that could be changed, and corrupted, of GEORGE WASHINGTON; a man, whose rare, and great accomplishments gained an accession of splendour from the depraved and abandoned European age in which he lived. After he had saved the British colonies in America from tyranny, and slavery, by his personal valour, and masterly knowledge of the art of war; he long preserved them in peace, and prosperity, by his political, moral, and religious virtues. To dispassionate, distinguishing, and good minds, it must be evident, that his conduct had soared to the utmost pitch of human excellence; of which he undoubtedly owed not a little to himself; yet much of it to beings of very different ranks, and dispositions. His GOD had endowed him with an uncommon rectitude of heart: and with as uncommon a union of calmness, vigour, &amp; elevation of mind: and these inestimable qualities were stimulated, and impelled, to their full exertion, and display, by the most iniquitous enemies, and oppressours of his country. AN EPITAPH ON MRS. POPE. HERE lies the female celebrated Young; Whose talents well deserve my plaintive song: Oft with fine fiction she resigned her breath; She suffered with decorum, nature's death. A greater actress never trod the stage, In comick elegance, or tragick rage. But since the force of mind; the person's grace; All the best honours of the human race, Soon cease to strike the soul, and charm the eye; Since all that flourishes but blooms to die; Let us to virtue fix the wandering heart; And through life's drama nobly act our part; While conscience issues, from her critick laws A verdict happier than the world's applause. Bishop's-gate: by Windsor Great Park; March 20th, 1797. AN EPITAPH ON THE RIGHT HON. EDMUND BURKE. HERE lies of Burke the cold, inactive clay; His soul exulting in perpetual day: With universal genius born to shine; All themes, at once to strengthen, and refine; Science, in aid of fancy, to engage; And pour it, softened, on his ardent page. Survey the beauties of his classick mind; The critick leaves Longinus far behind. Hear the great legislator plead the cause Of instituted; of eternal laws; Oppression, and rapacity submit To matchless reason; eloquence, and wit. See, while his thunders iron hearts assail, The tyrants of each hemisphere turn pale! Of private virtue by the warmth, and light; This luminary, more serenely bright, Beamed with descending, yet effulgent ray; And varied thus, and beautified his day. Hail! shade beatified! thou friend of man! Friend of God's mortal, and immortal plan! Thy moral fame, too strong to be withstood, Must make our youth ambitious to be good; Thy noble works which guard us while we live, Of heavenly bliss a demonstration give; For surely minds like thine can never die; They mount, by nature, and assert the sky; Their glory fires us to our latest breath; Protects, through life; and animates, in death! Durham, July 14th, 1797. AN INSCRIPTION FOR Written on a cottage, erected by Charles Grey, Esq. of Morrick. A COTTAGE, IN A PICTURESQUE AND BEAUTIFUL VALE IN NORTHUMBERLAND. WHOE'ER thou art, from life's low joys refined; Of nature, and the first, eternal mind Enamoured; welcome to these modern shades; Thy genuine worship needs no classick aids; Nor Phœbus; nor the nine Aonian maids. Objects this rude, this humble roof surround, Which aggrandize, which consecrate the ground. Here let thy soul it's noble scope enjoy; And deem a palace but a childish toy. While the descending sun attracts the sight; The fancy charms with varied tints of light; Or when the moon, with her inspiring ray Beams on the poet's mind a softer day, Then view the mead, the stream, the wood, the sky; And paper houses with Escurials vie. Or, if thou readest here those deathless lines, Where the sublime that conquers Homer shines; While Eden it's expanded bloom displays; Or, to “the living throne; the sapphire blaze,” While fancy soars, on bold, Miltonian wings; Look down on lords; on ministers, and kings. August 29th, 1798. THE NAVAL FIRST OF AUGUST, 1798. A SONG. YES! Nelson, the Godhead our gratitude owns; The protector of kings; the supporter of thrones! Our faith hears his thunder; his lightning we see, Launched by Howe, by St. Vincent, by Duncan, and thee! For as soon as the sails of our fleets are unfurled, Glory smiles on our isle, and enlivens the world. The worst plague of old Egypt through thee will he cure; For compared with French freedom, who would not endure Of darkness oppressive the palpable fogs; The pelting of hailstones; the croaking of frogs? But as soon as the sails, &amp;c. The Turk feels a joy, not unmingled with fear; Down the blush of the Czar steals of rapture a tear; Then, ourselves the Great Nation we surely might name, Had not France's Directors polluted the claim. For as soon as the sails, &amp;c. Ye traitors in heart, your malignity cease; Rail no more at this war; it will dictate a peace: But with heaven, and with earth still these wretches will jar; And infer our destruction from peace, or from war. Yet as soon as the sails, &amp;c. While ingratitude chills the seditious, below; From Olympus new beams of beatitude flow; Hawke is proud of the laurels that Nelson hath won, And great Chatham with transport looks down on his son. For as soon as the sails of our fleets are unfurled, Glory smiles on our isle, and enlivens the world. Durham, Oct. 6th, 1798. AN EPITAPH ON DAVID GARRICK. THE frost prevailing of a barbarous age, Bœtian fogs impended on our stage; When Shakespeare's genius, with a flood of light, Dispelled the darkness of dramatick night: With a new blaze our skies this comet fired; The fathers wondered;—but the sons admired. Beneath it's influence; by it's powerful aid, Our hearts, and minds completely were displayed; Guilt fled, affrighted, from it's piercing ray; But virtue courted it's propitious day. By him, from nature is her sceptre torne; Yet, on her plan, he peoples worlds unborn: Hence pleased we view the monster of his Isle, Contrasted with Miranda's magick smile: The dapper elves adorn the lunar scene; And suck the flower, or skim along the green. But honest time must fix the poet's claim; Must conquer malice, and perpetuate fame: Milton, and Dryden, urged the publick praise, By Pope led captive, with seraphick lays. Yet the first power of Avon's swan was great; Great was his rising, his deciding fate: His early glory fired the coldest heart; Even Ben despised his learning, and his art; Shakespeare subdued the critick's rugged mind; Still more victorious in an age refined, Inspiring Garrick, he subdued mankind. Lesbury, Oct. 2d, 1799. AN EPITAPH ON A FINE, PROMISING BOY, WHO DIED, AFTER A LONG AND EXCRUCIATING ILLNESS. SURE is the truth; though hid from mortal sight; “Whatever is, is,” ultimately, “right.” Friends may lament; but he, who early dies, Quits earth, and misery, for the blissful skies. He, whose existence, woes, and joys contrast, More charming feels the present by the past. Here lies the frame terrestrial of a boy, Mature, through torment, for the realms of joy. Though young, he practised his Redeemer's mind, The prayer, pathetic, but the will, resigned: Now purer rapture gives his soul a flow Which unembodied spirits only know; With such a rapture, 'midst the heavenly train, He thanks his Maker for his previous pain. AN EPITAPH ON PRINCE SUWARROW. HE, whose mean soul pollutes the name of Paul, With France conspiring, dooms great Suwarrow's fall; Just when the fervour of his dauntless mind Aspired completely to avenge mankind. If martial glory, stung with keen distress, Her drooping laurels views, and hints redress; If heaven-born genius bids the man be free; Away, with magick speed his honours flee; Despair, with iron hand precludes relief; He fought unconquered; but he dies with grief: No friend repeats fair fame's harmonious breath; No friend consoles him in the hour of death. If despotism excites not all thy hate, Indignant reader, think on Suwarrow's fate: With servile adulation art thou pained? Oh! think how Alfred; think how Virtue reigned! Lesbury, June 20th, 1800.

      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. THE AMYNTAS OF TASSO. TRANSLATED FROM THE ORIGINAL ITALIAN. [Ye, who your minds from pageantry withdraw] Ye, who your minds from pageantry withdraw, And love to study nature's simple law; Hither, ye few, your chaste attention bring; Here is the humble cot, the chrystal spring: The shepherd's flock, and fragrant bower are here, And all the beauties of the varied year. Here you may rove o'er vernal hill, and plain; Here the coy nymph you find, and bleeding swain: Here is displayed life's patriarchal hue; Arcadia, here, in London you may view: New Italy it's ancient genius gives, And mighty Maro in his Tasso lives. Nov. 17, 1769. AMYNTAS 1770 TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE EARL OF MORAY. THE PROLOGUE. Cupid in a Shepherd's dress. THE PERSONS. Cupid, in a Shepherd's Dress. Daphne, the Friend of Sylvia. Sylvia, loved by Amyntas. Amyntas, a Shepherd. Thyrsis, the Friend of Amyntas. A Satyr, in love with Sylvia. Nerina, a Shepherdess. Ergastus, a Shepherd. Elpinus, a Shepherd. A Chorus of Shepherds. 'Tis strange—but in a shepherd's poor disguise A God conceals himself from curious eyes: Yet no plebeian deity am I; My power controuls the greatest of the sky. Mass oft by me suspends his lust for war, Foregoes his crimson sword, and rattling car: Rough Neptune oft acknowledges my reign, And drops the trident which compels the main. Nay, my extensive influence reaches Jove, Ruler of men below, and gods above; Oft, at my will, some nymph's relaxing charms The universe's governour disarms; No more those bolts omnipotent are hurled That shake Olympus, and chastise the world. Skreened by a simple shepherd's garb, and face, My mother sure in vain my flight will trace. Whene'er at simple hearts my shafts I aim, I'm forced by stealth to leave my haughty dame; For she, a very female, proud, and vain, Despises empire of a modest strain; Allows me not to prostitute my darts (Such is her rant) to vile, ignoble hearts; Counts every victim from my bow too mean, Except a courtier, or a king, or queen; And bids me send my scouts, my menial loves, To skulk in cottages, and range in groves. But though I'm playful, and of youthful mien (Sure joyous love should in its god be seen) She shall not guide my province in her way; I am a deity, I know my sway, Know to my awful ensigns what I owe, The torch omnipotent, the golden bow For this I often court the peaceful plain, Nor can a mother's prayers my flight restrain: Tired with a capital's parade, and noise, I fly for refuge to Arcadia's joys: There am I pleased to see plain nature live; Olympus only purer sweets can give: There do I visit undistorted life— No rank diseases, no chagrin, no strife; There to extend my power, well-pleased I aim, And shed a lambent, not a scorching flame; There I can act upon my genuine plan, And, like a god, promote the good of man. Thus when I chuse in person to maintain O'er fields, and villages my peaceful reign; My mother, ever bent on some great aim. Too haughty to inspire a rural flame, To call me to her aid, from paltry views, The vagrant rebel oft in vain pursues; And promises to those who find her boy, The rapturous kiss, or more extatick joy. Mistaken Venus! is not mine the power, As well as thine, to bless the tender hour? To purchase my concealment when I rove In happy vales, and cherish guiltless love, Say, cannot I those tempting bribes employ, The rapturous kiss, or more extatick joy? The fair, most apt a secret to reveal, True to my interest, my retreats conceal: A kiss from Venus, with her charms divine, To females is not half so dear as mine; A kiss by me, the God of Love, impressed, Must speak strong language to a fair-one's breast; The god of love, who sure must know its art, Can always for himself transfix a heart. But that I might elude each curious view, And at my leisure my design pursue, I carry not the marks that Cupid show, I'm stripped of wings, of quiver, and of bow. Yet not without my arms I take the field; 'Tis not in vain this magick rod I wield; My torch I've metamorphosed to this rod, It still obeys the purpose of it's god; Its powerful motions certain love inspire; Sure as Jove's bolt it darts its subtle fire. And though this arrow is not tipped with gold, In it my wonted sovereignty I hold; It will not lag, nor will it miss its aim, But through the destined heart drive all my flame. I with this arrow mean to pierce the heart Of one who never felt love's pungent smart; To thaw from sterll frost to warm desire The coldest virgin of Diana's choir; And Sylvia's breast shall all that ardour know With which my dart inflamed some years ago Amyntas' bosom, who, as yet a boy, By Sylvia's side still felt a secret joy; Still at the chace with Sylvia scoured the plains, And joined in all the pastimes of the swains. And that my shaft it's errand well may go, And make a thorough victim of my foe, The tender, lucky moment I'll espy, When pity from her soul darts to her eye; When, listening to his tale of artless truth, She sheds soft glances on the constant youth. Then, when her virgin ice dissolves away, Then, when her ear endures his amorous lay, When she forgets each frown, each female whim, I'll pierce her through and make her bleed like him. Coy Sylvia now is hastening to the plain, Where spotless mirth oft chears the nymph and swain; Where to the dance, the song, and rural play, The happy throng devote this festal day. Thither will I in shepherd's garb repair, Mix with the peasants, in their pleasure share; And at the crisis let my arrow fly, Too swift, and fine to meet a mortal eye. These wondering woods, and rivulets, to-day, Shall echo an unusual amorous lay; And by it's energy it shall appear The deity of love himself is here. I, as I list, the human frame controul; I mollify, and raise the rudest soul; By me the clown imbibes rich fancy's store, And rustick tongues fine elocution pour: And whilst my flame inspires the shepherd's thought, His reed shall emulate a Pindar's note. I generously remove wealth's proud barrier, Of distant ranks bring kindred tempers near; And spurning custom's arbitrary rule, Would fain bring back the world to nature's school. Yet rashly 'tis pronounced that I am blind— No; be the blindness charged on human kind. Let man with reason mix my hallowed fire, And then shall happiness exalt desire. ACT I. SCENE I. DAPHNE and SYLVIA. DAPHNE. Wilt thou, then, Sylvia, waste the bloom of youth, Rejecting, sullenly, the joys of love? Say, shall a mother's tender, moving name, Never be music to thy callous ear! Can thy obdurate soul conceive no bliss, To see thy sportive children round thee play? Nay, humanize thy breast; put on the woman; Nor be a rebel to the voice of nature. SYLVIA. Let other nymphs court the delights of love; If love indeed has more delights than pains; A hardy, Amazonian life be mine: Let but my bow with happy negligence Be slung, my quiver gracefully depend; And I shall think my person well adorned. Let me the timid hare, or stag pursue; Let me the foremost brave the fiercer savage, Urge the nice aim, and bring him to the ground; And I shall never, Daphne, want employment To keep the working mind enough in action. Let other maids of a more languid frame, Their souls enervate with destructive love. DAPHNE. Insipid pleasures! an unnatural life! And if those rustic occupations please thee, It is because thou hast not proved sublimer. Thus to the world yet in its infant state, Acorns and water were a sweet repast; The food of animals in better times! For Ceres gives us now her golden grain, And wine exhilarates the heart of man. Did but the happiness once reach thy soul, Such as a heart loving and loved enjoys, Thou wouldst repent, thou wouldst with sighs exclaim —Alas! I've missed the road to Happiness! The time is lost that is not passed in love! How long I've lived a vegetable life, How long I've wanted sentimental being! Oh! my past time! how many lonely nights, How many dull unsocial days I've wasted, That might have been laid out on mutual love, Which gains new zest, and rises on enjoyment! Once more, refine thy breast; put on the woman, Nor be a rebel to the voice of nature. Life's flower will fade; regret may come too late. SYLVIA. When I repent, when I with sighs exclaim, As thy luxurious fancy painteth me, Retorted rivers to their springs shall flow; The wolf shall fly the lamb, the hound the hare; The bear shall quit the land, and seek the sea; The dolphin flounce upon our towering Alps. DAPHNE. I know the obstinate caprice of youth: Such as my Sylvia is, was Daphne too. My person, and my face, resembled thine. Like thine my hair in flaxen ringlets waved. My lips were just of that vermilion hue; And on my cheeks the rose by fine degrees Was in the lily lost. My passion then, (The passion of an unexperienced maid) Was but to tend the nets, to lime the twigs; To whet the dart, and trace the timorous deer; And if I met a shepherd's amorous eye, I, savage-like, fixed mine upon the ground, In shame, and rage; nay I despised my charms; I hated them, because they pleased another. As if it had been crime, and infamy, To raise a passion wrought in human nature. But how our sentiments are changed by time! And what strange revolutions in us work The service, merit, ardent supplications Of an importunate and constant lover! I was subdued, I own it; and the arms, With which the victor gained, at length, his conquest, Were, humble patience, sighs, and warm complaints, Assisted by a female sympathy, That pleads the cause of an impassioned lover. The shades oracular of one short night Threw more illumination on my mind, Than many a hundred suns had done before. I chid my folly, and with keen regret, I said—the emblems which I long have worn As thy disciple, Cynthia, now I quit— I quit my bow, my passion for the chace; Sport for untutored souls, but not for mine: Love hath reclaimed me to my sex's joys. With such humanity, I yet would hope, Amyntas will his Sylvia's mind impress, And mollify to love that heart of stone. That heart by every title he should gain. What more engaging youth adorns our hamlets? Did ever shepherd burn with warmer love? Say, do not rival nymphs bleed for Amyntas? Yet can their flame, or can thy cruel scorn, One moment turn his constant thoughts from thee; Can'st thou pretend his birth discredits thine? The fair Cydippe was thy mother; she Claimed for her sire our noble river-god; And is not he Silvanus' son, of whom Pan is the father, the great god of shepherds? Look in the mirror of the chrystal stream, And Sylvia, thou must own that Amaryllis Possesses beauty not less rare than thine. Yet he rejects her smiles, and courts thy frowns. Suppose (determined man can do strange things, Heaven grant the supposition may be vain!) That he, by thy disdain at length, enraged, Turns all his thoughts on Amaryllis' charms; And forms her, by imagination's power, Into his object of connubial bliss? What then will be thy mind? how will it bear To think him irretrievably another's? To think him happy in a rival's arms? To see him give thee back thy haughty scorn? SYLVIA. Amyntas, as he pleases, may bestow His heart, and person; 'tis not my concern. He never can be mine: why should I then Envy the fortune of the maid he chuses? Nay—were he mine, I never could be his: Affection shrinks; it withers on compulsion. DAPHNE. Whence your aversion to him? SYLVIA. From his love. DAPHNE. Effect inhuman from a cause benign! Obdurate son sprung from a gentle sire! Thou counteractest nature's general laws. Do the mild sheep engender ravenous wolves? Do snowy swans produce the sooty crow? Sylvia, you either trifle with your friend, Or with yourself, misled by female whim. SYLVIA. Amyntas's design makes me dislike him; The man who proffers love I count my foe; Under the specious word destruction lurks; And while Amyntas passed his hours with me In general converse, and in light amusement, I own, my Daphne, I esteemed the swain. But when he talked of serious, fatal love, Disgust succeeded straight my friendship for him. DAPHNE. You quite mistake the object of your swain: He means to make himself and Sylvia happy. SYLVIA. Daphne, I'll give no longer my attention To such discourse; propose some other theme. DAPHNE. Thou supercilious girl! yet prithee tell me; Art thou determined to accept no lover? SYLVIA. Whoe'er should make the proffer, I'd reject him; I'd deem him a betrayer; one who lay In artful, flowery ambush for my honour. Such you call lovers; I call deadly foes. DAPHNE. The mild creation contradicts thy spleen. Yonder the sheep are grazing, harmless race! And if we knew not their innoxious life, Their very bleat bespeaks their innocence. Say, does the ram conspire against his ewe; Does his breast harbour any black design? The lordly bull, so dreadful in his wrath, Whose roar, and levelled head, and pawing hoof, Wither the stoutest mortal with affright, Is to his heifer mild; to her he shows No rougher treatment than his clumsy love. Dost thou imagine that the faithful turtle Intends hostility against his mate? The constant pair seek a sequestered shade, Far from the noise, the violence of man: There do they perch, and in the soft caress, And tender dialogue they pass the day. Their voice announces their pathetic souls, Their souls pathetic, breathing nought but love. And while they coo, the corresponding woods, The rugged rocks, seem to admire their flame. Canst thou suppose the spring, the smiling spring, When love diffuses all his genial influence, A season that produces gloomy passions? Now the gay period reigns; mark it's effects. Observe the dove, seated on yonder elm; With soothing murmur how he bills his mate. Hark the sweet nightingale on yonder spray; What harmony distends his little throat! 'Tis love's warm imagery that fires his breast; And pours his raptured sentiments in musick. The shifting scenes of love are all before him; I hear it in the changes of his voice. Listen, my Sylvia—now in short, timid accents, He supplicates his mistress—but in vain; Now he laments, and as he feels her rigour, Breathes forth a lengthened, liquid, dying note— Oh! his complaint has won her:—he concludes In joyful flourishes, in strains of triumph. 'Tis love that animates his varied song; He says in every note—“I love, I love.” Even the dark adder, at this social season, Intent on love, forgets his baleful poison: The fierceness of the tiger is subdued, The lordly lion, king of beasts is humbled. Why on the brute creation need I dwell? The mighty power of love pervades the trees. See how the amorous vines embrace their elms; Beeches for beeches, rugged oaks for oaks Express their inclination by their dress, Their whispering rustle, and consenting wave. Wouldst thou then rank thyself below the plants, Dead to the lively sentiments of love? Shake off thy prejudice; put on the woman, Nor be a rebel to the voice of nature. SYLVIA. Well, Daphne, when I hear the sighs of plants, I frankly will consent to be a lover. DAPHNE. Sylvia, thy folly only can be equalled By thy insensibility to love. Dost thou then make advice, and argument The ill-timed subject of insipid banter? But go, thou foolish maid; the time will come When thou in vain severely wilt repent Thy inattention to my friendly lessons. I speak not of that mortifying time When thou shalt fly the mirror of the stream, Where oft thy face thou viewest, and perhaps, Unfeeling as thou art, dost oft admire it: The time when thou shalt fly the limpid fountain, Dreading to see the ruins of thy beauty, The furrows of old age, thy withered hue, Spoiled of the lily, and the rose, for ever; The certain havock of life's cruel winter. No, Sylvia, this is not the dreadful time, Nor this the evil of which I forewarn thee; 'Tis common, and 'tis therefore not so galling. Canst thou not recollect what sage Elpinus Told, a few days ago, the fair Lycoris?— Lycoris, who as deeply should imbibe Soft passion from Elpinus' noble song As he receives it from Lycoris' eye; If mortals once could love by reason's laws. Battus, and Thyrsis heard Elpinus tell it, Both finished masters in the art of love. He told it in Aurora's sacred cave, Where, o'er the portal awfully is written, “Be feet profane far from this hallowed place.” He told us—and he said he had the truth From the great bard, who sung of arms and love, And dying left him his harmonious flute; —That in the nether world there is a cave, Gloomy and drear, where lazy Acheron Sends forth sulphureous, pestilential vapour; And in that cave, he said, ungrateful women Would live eternally, by Heaven's decree, In darkness, frantick grief, and Stygian anguish. Sylvia, if you persist to steel your heart, Expect a mansion in that dire abode. Well do the wretches in another state, Deserve to suffer unremitted torment, Whom tears of misery never moved in this. SYLVIA What did Lycoris then; how did she answer This strange denunciation? DAPHNE. Art thou anxious To know another's conduct?—mend thy own. She answered with her eyes. SYLVIA. I understand not that: The eye is mute; how can it form an answer? DAPHNE. A novice thou to love's expressive language! The soft and strong emotions of the soul In magick beams are darted from the eye. She smiled on her Elpinus with her eyes: I marked them—these were their distinct expressions. “Dear swain, my person, and my heart are thine. Implore the deities of love no more. No further testimony can I give thee Of my affection now; this is enough For modest nymph to give, chaste swain to take. Enough thou wilt esteem it, if Elpinus Honest as bright believes Lycoris' eyes; If they deserve at once his faith and love.” SYLVIA. What reason had he to suspect their truth? DAPHNE. What? didst thou never hear what Thyrsis wrote In love's dehrium, on Lycoris' eyes? When the poor shepherd, stung to amorous frenzy, Roamed through the lonely woods, to feed his passion, Object of pity to the nymphs, and swains: And so extravagant his passion was, Their pity was accompanied with mirth But his warm verse was not ridiculous. I read the lines myself, which he had written On many a tree; and with the trees they grew. “Destructive eyes, false mirrors of the heart! I, to my sorrow know the lies you've told me: Yet what avails it me to know your lies, If I still wish to view the basilisk, And catch fresh ruin from your fatal rays?” SYLVIA. Daphne, I'm wasting here my precious time, Harangued, in vain, by thy luxurious fancy. I had forgotten that in Elicetum A numerous hunting party meets to-day. Thither I go; but in the wonted stream First will I bathe, and cleanse me from the dust Of yesterday; 'twas a fatiguing chace; The stag our game, which I, with warm career Pursued, the foremost; overtook, and killed. Daphne farewell. DAPHNE. Sylvia farewell, but know What to our gentle sex we women owe; Know, that the boisterous pleasure of the chace Is not the province of the female race. It brutifies the temper of a man; How distant is it then from woman's plan! Our spirits ought to keep a tender strain, Refine delight, and blunt the sting of pain. Abjure the chace; be present to thy mind, The sphere by heaven to rural charms assigned.— Let rough barbarians bound o'er hill and plain, Be ours the task to bless the humble swain; The sameness of his station to beguile, Crown his gay hours, and make his labour smile: And when the business of the day is done, When he hies homeward with the setting sun, To give him sweet ideas of his cot, And make him triumph in his peaceful lot; To make him there expect domestick joy, The wife assiduous, and the prattling boy; To draw Elysium on our state below, And bliss which wealth and grandeur never know. SCENE II. Amyntas, and Thyrsis. AMYNTAS. Thyrsis, the gentle streams have not denied Their sympathetick murmur to my woes. I've known the trees, with softly-trembling leaves, Whisper their pity to my warm complaint: The rocks have softened as I poured my lay. Harder than rocks I find my cruel fair: Her breast will ne'er admit my moving tale. Doth she deserve the tender name of woman? No; she hath quite renounced her feeling sex, The delicate emotions of her nature; Since she denies her lover that compassion Which even the world inanimate vouchsafes him. THYRSIS. 'Tis the lamb's joy to crop the tender herb; The wolf's regale is to devour the lamb; But more inexorable love delights In the fell homage of a harsher tribute; Sighs are his incense; his libation, tears. AMYNTAS. Alas! my Thyrsis, love is surely sated With my reiterated sighs, and tears: The savage god is thirsting for my blood; And soon it shall be shed; soon shall stern Cupid, With sterner Sylvia, view my deadly wound, And with their eyes enjoy life's crimson flood, My spreading paleness, and my last convulsions. THYRSIS. You rave, Amyntas; moderate your passion With reason; you may find another mistress, If you're despised by this inhuman fair one. AMYNTAS. Another mistress find!—I've lost myself: When grim despair with his chill hand hath seized us, And broken nature's elasticity, We look around for solace, but in vain. THYRSIS. Weak-hearted man!—drive off the fiend despair: Firm perseverance yet may gain the nymph. What will not time, and perseverance do! The keen progression of the mind of man Changes in every age the face of nature: Nought is too wondrous for it's force, and art; It tames the lions, and Hyrcanian tygers. AMYNTAS. But my distress will not admit delay: I long for shelter in the quiet grave. THYRSIS. You will not need to brook a long delay; Woman is angry soon, and soon appeased; A childish, volatile, capricious thing; By trifling motives different ways inclined, As is the nodding ear of golden Ceres, Or limber osier by the lightest air. But sure Amyntas might acquaint his Thyrsis With the whole secret of his hapless passion. You have to me lamented oft your flame; But you have never yet told me it's object. It is a trust you may repose in me, A trust to friendship, and the Muses due. Together oft we cultivate the Muses, And with their scenes enrich our simple life: Oft do the Muses on a beauteous eve, The sky serene, and drowsy nature hushed, We tending homewards through the silent vale, Vouchsafe celestial sounds to rural ears; And raise our humble minds above their stretch, With such warm fancy, such ethereal forms, As 'scape the vulgar intellectual eye. These views, Amyntas, should enlarge thy soul, Pardon the kind rebuke, and make thee know Where thou may'st lodge it in full confidence. Why need I launch into the praise of friendship? Friendship the best support of wretched man! Which gives us, when our life is painful to us, A sweet existence in another's being! Revere, O swain, the sacred rights of friendship. AMYNTAS. Thyrsis, I'll tell without reserve to thee, What oft I've told to streams, and trees, and mountains, But never yet revealed to human ear. For as my death approaches, I would wish To leave my story with my faithful friend, That he at proper junctures might relate it, And carve it on some venerable beech, Under whose boughs I have my sepulture; A useful monument to future swains. Then may the cruel fair-one tread my ashes; Then may she say, with barbarous exultation, “Thus have my powerful charms completely triumphed.” Then may her triumph be increased, to find My tale is known to all the neighbouring swains, Is known to many a traveller who by chance Bends to the melancholy spot his way. And, Thyrsis, may not I presume (alas! I hope the honour of too great a boon) That Sylvia, one day, will repent her harshness; Will feel her heart melt with too late compassion; Will love my memory, and by oft comparing Amyntas living with Amyntas dead, Comparison which kills the worst resentments, Break into some such tender exclamation— “Oh! were he yet on earth; and were he mine!” Now, Thyrsis, hear. THYRSIS. Proceed; I mark thee well; Haply for better purpose than thou weenest. AMYNTAS. When yet I was a boy; when yet my hand Could hardly reach to seize the luscious fig, Depending from it's fragrant lowly tree, I formed an intimacy with a maid, The fairest sure, whose flowing, golden tresses Were ever kissed by Zephyr's wanton breeze. The daughter of Cydippe is the fair, Her father is Montanus, rich in herds; Sylvia her name: she was my young companion; And she at present is my amorous theme. Sylvia, the pride of woods, the flame of shepherds! Amyntas with his Sylvia lived some time, Exchanging such a pure, delightful friendship, That the harmonious hearts of two chaste turtles Did never beat in truer unison. Near to each other were our cottages; But nearer to each other were our souls; Time had impressed us both with equal years; But nature with more equal sentiments. Nets was I wont to spread with her, the ambush To catch the feathered tribe, and scaly fry; With her I always urged the vigorous chace: Our sport was common; common was our spoil. But while I thus waged war with animals, And made fell havock of the brute creation, Love by degrees stealing me from myself, Insensibly subdued the mighty hunter. I found a gradual, and a new affection Spring in my breast, as grows the blade of grass, Advancing by degrees from source unknown. This unaccountable augmenting passion Made me unhappy but in Sylvia's presence; And while I gazed upon her, from her eyes I drank a strange, intoxicating pleasure, Which, though transporting, left a sting behind it. I often sighed, and wondered why I sighed; I was a lover, ignorant of love. Well did I know it's nature in the end: I'll tell the how:—Thyrsis attend my story. THYRSIS. You paint so strongly that I must attend it. AMYNTAS. One day beneath the beech's spreading shade, Phillis and Sylvia sate, and I sate with them. When lo, a bee, that hummed around the mead, Gathering her sweets, fastened on Phillis' cheek, Bit it with eagerness, and sucked its balm— On Phillis' cheek, vermilion as the rose; And haply by its view deceived, the insect, Mistook it for some rich, ambrosial flower. Phillis, forthwith, impatient of the puncture, Expressed her pain in girlish lamentation. But her consoling Sylvia thus addressed her: “Grieve not, my Phillis; I'll remove thy smart; The intruder's little wound I soon will heal By application of a verbal charm. I learned the secret from the sage Aresia; And in return a beauteous horn I gave her, Which to the chace I bore (thou oft hast seen it) Ivory the substance was; 'twas set in gold.” She spoke; and straight approached her beauteous lips, Her lips nectareous to the wounded cheek Of Phillis, pressed them to the injured part; And in sweet accent murmured certain verses; But murmured them so low I could not hear them. Astonishing effect! immediately, The pain, and bite that caused it, were removed; Whether by virtue of the magick words, Or rather, as I ween, by Sylvia's lips, Whose touch, with more than Esculapian power, Must balsam give to body, and to soul. I, who till then no higher bliss desired Than to enjoy the golden privilege Of viewing the mild lustre of her eyes, Or hearing the sweet musick of her tongue, Far sweeter than the murmuring rivulet, Whose gliding stream the pebbles gently break; More soothing than the breath of vernal Zephyr, In whisper stealing through the trembling leaves: I from that moment felt a new desire, Wishing that Sylvia's lips, and mine might meet: And on a sudden, from a rustic boy, Grown to a politician (strange! how love Whets the blunt intellect!) I soon bethought me Of a sly stratagem to gain my purpose. An angry bee, enraged, as I pretended, Because with heedless hand I drove it from me, Had on my lip a thrilling wound inflicted. Keen agony I feigned, and sore lamented; And with a supplicating aspect begged The favour, which my tongue durst not petition. The simple Sylvia took compassion on me, And offered me her efficacious cure. But when I felt her rosy mouth touch mine, Heavens! how it penetrated all my frame! It smote each nerve with instantaneous fire, Deepened my real wound, and made it mortal. Assiduous bee never such honey sipped, As I from Sylvia's blooming lips inhaled, More aromatic than the new-blown rose. And yet the kiss was languid; maiden instinct Prevented Sylvia from impressing it; And I with awe was overwhelmed, and durst not Complete it with the energy of love. That memorable kiss conveyed such sweets, Though mixed with lurking poison to my heart, That I kept up the fraud; and oft told Sylvia, Her magick had not its effect on me; And she repeated oft the pleasing charm. Augmenting daily from that fatal time, My passion grew at length so violent, And so impatient my anxiety, They tore my breast, and forced me to reveal them. Once when the shepherds, and the nymphs were met, For evening relaxation, at the pastime, In which each member of the merry circle Whispers his secret in his neighbour's ear; My cruel fair was seated next to me. I whispered her,—“Sylvia, I burn for thee; “Favour thy lover's passion, or he dies.” She to the ground her beauteous face declined, Suffused with sudden red, the mark of shame, And anger: silence was her sole rejoinder; It was a sullen, agitated silence, On which severe reproofs, and dreadful threats Sate lowering. She arose, and left the play: And hath not from that time vouchsafed to see me. Now three times hath the sweating reaper shorn From the luxuriant fields the golden grain; Three times departing autumn hath announced With falling leaves the bleak approach of winter, While to appease that unforgiving maid, Each art, each effort have I tried, but death. And willingly I'd die, would but my death Either excite her pleasure, or her grief— But which emotion should I wish to raise? 'Twould be but grateful in her to embalm The memory of her constant swain with grief. And yet I would not wish with sharp sensation To sting, and harrass her soft, snowy breast; Or dim, with tears, the lustre of her eye. THYRSIS. And is it possible that if she heard These generous words she would not pity thee; And pity is an avenue to love. AMYNTAS. I dare not hope she would; for now her ear Is as insensible to my complaint As is the adder's to the charms of musick. THYRSIS. Fear not, Amyntas; I will undertake To soften thy obdurate fair-one's rigour, And make her more propitious to thy suit. AMYNTAS. Alas! my friend, too well I know her nature; Thy kind endeavours nothing will avail: Or if they should obtain a patient ear, Her heart will still be inaccessible. THYRSIS Why art thou thus a prey to black despair? AMYNTAS. I have but too just reason to despair, For Mopsus prophesied my hapless love: Mopsus, endowed with more than mortal wisdom; The language of the birds to him is known, He knows the latent powers of plants, and springs. THYRSIS. What Mopsus dost thou mean? that artful Mopsus, Whose tongue is honeyed with endearing words; On whose false lips sits an inviting smile; Mopsus, who cloaks the murderer with the friend? For all the idle, dismal prophecies, With which he terrifies unwary minds, Uttering them with authoritative air, As if they carried fate, are ne'er fulfilled. Experience warrants me to paint him thus: Therefore again I say, be of good courage; For I believe your flame will be successful, From his malicious, and blind augury. AMYNTAS. If by experience, Thyrsis, thou art taught To give no credit to his prophecies, An instance would afford me consolation. THYRSIS. A memorable instance will I give thee. I hope the reader will excuse the length, and local allusion of this speech, and forgive the translator for not shortening, and altering it; as there is not another like it in the whole poem. Thyrsis indeed pays a compliment again to the duke of Ferrara, in the second scope of the second act; but it is very short in comparison; the hint is here given by Virgil's O Melibœe, deus nobis hæc otia fecit. It must be allowed that Passo, in general, in this poem, speaks to the universal feelings of mankind; an essential, and indispensable rule in poetry.When fortune brought me to our peaceful shades, I soon became acquainted with this Mopsus; And then I judged him such as thou hast thought him, Wise, and sincere, and friendly I believed him. It so fell out, that I was called by business, And urged by rustick curiosity, To visit that great city where the Po, Immortalized by bards, his tribute pours. Before I undertook this enterprize, High enterprize to simple, fearful swain, To Mopsus I unfolded my design, As to a faithful counsellor, and prophet. He shook his head, and said—Beware, my son, And tread with cautious step the dangerous ground, Whither thou tendest: 'tis beset with snares. The merchant there will lie in wait for thee; Tempt thee with the false lustre of his ware, Rob thee with smiles of generosity, With all the paltry eloquence of trade, And tell a thousand lies to gain a farthing. The courtier, too depraved in soul to feel Humane enjoyment at the sight of nature, Will make a sport of thee, thy coarse attire, Thy simple manners, thy unpolished language, Thy happy ignorance of perverted life; His mean servility, his rampant bow, His trembling at a creature like himself, His childish passions, his ideal wants, Ten thousand times more worthy to be laughed at. Guide then thy steps, my son, with circumspection: Avoid the lumber, the parade of grandeur; Let not thy mind be dazzled with the glare. Fly from the Tyrian glow that mocks the eye; The plume as airy as the head that wears it; The lying blazon, falsely speaking worth; The monument of long-departed greatness. Fly all the vain idolaters of fashion; Their souls as trifling as the modes they worship. But above all, withhold thy prudent step From the grand magazine of earthly folly. What place is that, said I?—There, he replied, Female magicians dwell; who with false sights Delude the eye, and with false sounds the ear. Their diamond is rude stone, their gold but brass: Their silver coffers full of orient treasure, Are wicker baskets, and replete with trash. With art of sorcery the walls are formed; Strangely they speak, and answer to the speaker; Not giving back the mutilated word, As echo answers in the rural shade; But fully they return it; and they add, (Surprizing to relate!) words of their own. The tables, and the chairs, the beds, and curtains, All implements of that inchanted palace, Articulate, and speak with restless tongue. There, lies, in shape of little playful children, Hover, and sport, inspiring wicked tales. Nay; if a person, speechless from the womb, Should chance to enter there, his organ straight Would by the devilish magick be unloosed; Spite of himself, he'd in a moment catch The voluble infection of the place. But these are the least evils thou may'st meet: Thou may'st of human figure be deprived; May'st pass into a melancholy willow, Into a plaintive stream, or sighing flame. Such was the lesson gloomy Mopsus gave me. I to the city went, not without fear, My fancy haunted by his dreadful picture, Which better information soon effaced. Kind Providence my wandering steps conducted To the blest mansion of terrestrial sweets, Which he had drawn in such alarming colours. Forth from the palace issued heavenly musick, The voice of swains, melodious nymphs, and Sirens; And such a tide of captivating bliss, That for a while I stood, absorbed in wonder. A goodly person at the door I spied, He seemed the guardian of the paradise; Graceful his shape, and noble was his mien: I knew not from his ensigns, what to deem him, A warriour brave, or courtly cavalier. With face benign, tempering his dignity, Accosting me, he begged that I would enter, Survey the mansion, and partake it's pleasures. Thus he, among the first in rank and splendor, Was pleased to honour an ignoble swain. Enter I did—but heavens! what sights I saw! I saw musicians with Orphean finger Striking the lyre: a company I saw Of heavenly goddesses, and beauteous nymphs; Some in luxuriant, airy dress; their hair, And face uncumbered with fantastick mode; Bright as Aurora, harbinger of day, Diffusing virgin light, and pearly dew. Apollo and the Muses there I saw, With heavenly sounds enchanting mortal ear; Raising the coldest hearer to a poet, And opening all the sentimental world. Amongst the Muses was Elpinus seated, Elpinus high in fame amongst our swains. With such pervading, and parental eye Omniscient Heaven the worthy man surveys, In the sequestered shade and humble garb; And raises to such unexpected honour The modest friend of virtue, and the Muse. Spurning my rustick diffidence, to think The fortune of Elpinus might be mine, And waked to rapture I had never known, My fancy heated with surrounding objects, I raised my voice, and sung of war and heroes, My former unaspiring themes disdaining, The shepherds humble, and unpolished lay. And though it was my fate to seek again These woods; yet still my pipe retains a part Of the bold character which then I caught; It sounds not weak, but with a martial tone, And makes the astonished woods, and valleys ring. The envious Mopsus heard my epic strain, And viewed me with malign, bewitching eye: With hoarseness I was smit; and, for a time, I could not speak; the neighbouring shepherds thought A wolf had seen me; but the wolf was he. So much I've told thee, that thou may'st not fear To have such fate as he predicted thee: Instead of robbery and ridicule, I, at the famous city, met with honours, And I returned enriched with sacred genius. Mopsus' heart is black; whence every object Wears a grim hue to his distempered soul. And though his warning in the main was just, And holds too strongly in exalted life; He was not seer enough to know the court To which I went, was an exception to it. In general, what he prophecies is false: Hope then; and give his prophecy to thee, A happy, and inverted explanation. AMYNTAS. Thyrsis, thy words give comfort to my soul; Be thou the generous guardian of my life. THYRSIS. I'll not neglect the charge, I'll urge thy interest: Fail not to meet me here within an hour. Mean while, the duties of a man revolve, And steel thy bosom with the firm resolve, Not to resign thyself a dupe to fear, By giving scope to fancy's wild career. For oh! Amyntas! when misguided man Departs from reason's all-sufficient plan, To happiness in vain presumes to tend, By means that do not on himself depend; Crosses attack him in a numerous train, And all the family of moral pain. Yet this but theory; I do not mean From it's deep-rooted love thy heart to wean; Love still must actuate the sequestered swain, His highest pleasure, and acutest pain; Or else a mere machine he'd draw his breath, In dull indifference, in a living death. But in thy breast let reason have her share; A tempered passion gives a tempered care. When reason's gentle government we quit, Too warmly with an earthly object smit; Blindly we're driven by passions furious sway, The heddy mind is every trifle's play; Each little circumstance our fear awakes, Which reason in it's just proportion takes. Thus does the shepherd, blest with vigorous eyes, See objects in their proper form, and size: But if distemper hath impaired his sight, Bright Sol directs him with fallacious light; He sees a robber in the rustling spray, And for a wolf mistakes his faithful Tray. CHORUS. Simple and happy age of gold! thy praise We make not now the subject of our lays; Because when the young world was blest with thee, Milk flowed in streams, and honey from the tree. We praise thee not, that earth her fruits, and grain Bestowed without the labour of the swain: That never heedless boy the serpent stung, Never o'er melancholy mortals hung The gloomy cloud; but Æther, ever clear, And Zephyr, gave an equal, smiling year: No rude extremes the world primæval knew; Nor Sirius scorched, nor wintry Boreas blew. Contending nations had not learned to jar, No fleet from shore to shore transported war; Nor yet had commerce wafted o'er the seas As certain death, imbittered by disease. These blessings only to that age belong; Yet not for them we raise our simple song: For other bliss that age we chiefly prize; Mistaken mortals, hear it, and be wise. As yet audacious Honour had not birth; he tyrant-phantom was not known on earth; Honour, a pompous, unsubstantial name, That fills with lies the sounding trump of Fame; That bids an honest poor man be a slave, And to a deity erects a knave; Confounds the characters by Jove assigned, And contradicts the great, eternal Mind. In early times, we modestly desired Just what the genuine frame of man required; How could we then this idol's rule obey, How be tormented with his Gothick sway? Homage to no superior then we owed, Life's innocence in equal tenour flowed; No chain of thought disturbed the vacant race, Oppression sate not pensive on the face; Nor was the breast by fell ambition torn They never for a rose mistook a thorn: They never trembled with preposterous awe, Unerring nature was their only law; And all her rights she had with easy claim, For they, and inclination were the same. Without the torch, and bow, like rustick boys, (Heaven deigned to mingle then with earthly joys) The little Loves the festal dance would lead, With nymphs, and shepherds, on the flowery mead: While purling streams, and warblers from the spray, To fuller concert raised the rural lay. On the soft bank, or through the shady grove, The simple pair would open all their love; Perhaps a thought, more ardent than the rest, Would in a breathing whisper be expressed; At length the burning kiss, the amorous toy, Love's playful preludes, brought completer joy. The virgin's growing breast was then unveiled; For no false fear that artless breast assailed: And, bold through innocence, the naked maid Oft in the river with her shepherd played: 'Tis Honour, which in these flagitious times Blasphemes the deeds of nature into crimes. Thou, Honour, first, stern foe to human kind, Didst check the generous current of the mind; Didst bid the maid consume with hidden fire, And tremble to indulge innate desire; To formal deadness didst the eye controul, And kill the beam by which we see the soul. No more the graceful negligence is seen; The feeling being is a flat machine. Where is love's gay disport? the frolick play, Chacing the winter's eve, and summer's day? Where are the flowing locks of beauteous hair, Sweetly disordered by the wanton air? The flowing locks are in a net confined, Sad emblem of the fair-one's fettered mind. Our words, our steps the school of honour guides, And solemn folly o'er our life presides. The golden days of liberty are o'er, We steal the bliss, which was a gift before. These, Honour, are the boons thy laws confer; By thee we suffer, for by thee we err. But hence to busy life; we cannot bear Thy cumbrous grandeur, and thy dazzling glare: O'er courts, and cities, thou wast meant to reign; They seek thy guilt; and let them feel thy pain. Hence to the great, nor from thy empire stray; Let old Simplicity the simple sway. Let us make most of time, love, sport and sing: For fleeting time is ever on the wing. Each evening Phœbus quits the sky, and laves His golden tresses in the western waves: He sets to beam again with orient ray, With new-born vigour to restore the day: But at the fatal close of life's career, We leave for ever the terrestrial sphere: Sink to a dark irremeable shore; We set on Styx's strand, and rise no more. End of the First Act. ACT II. SCENE I. The Satyr alone. Small is the bee, yet sorely doth it wound; It shoots a cruel, agonizing sting. Yet Love is less; 'tis imperceptible. In charming, though diminutive retreats, The little tyrant takes his deadly aim. Oft does he lurk beneath an eye-brow's arch, And there he kills us with the visual ray, That animated passage of the soul: Couched in a flowing lock of golden hair, From that soft ambush oft the subtle urchin Peeps out, and deals an unexpected death. Oft doth he ply his arrows from a dimple; And from that covert, seemingly the seat Of smiles, and innocence he slyly plays Destruction on the unwary, fond admirer. I burn with love; it tingles through my frame; The unrelenting deity hath emptied His quiver on me, from fair Sylvia's eyes. Oh cruel Love! yet still more cruel Sylvia! A tongue oracular gave thee thy name; For thou art truly sylvan: nay, the woods Harbour not such a fell, remorseless brood As thy inhuman bosom nourisheth. The woods afford, under their verdant foliage, Shelter to snakes, to lions, and to bears: Thy snowy breast, whose mild, luxurious view Invites to rapturous joy, and balmy peace, Perfidiously conceals disdain, and hatred, And hard inflexibility; those monsters, More savage far than snakes, or bears, or lions. These may be tamed by art, and blandishment; But those we cannot win by gift, or prayer. When I for thee, my amorous soul absorbed In thy idea, cull the choicest flowers; And offer them with love's humility, Thou haughtily rejectest them; perhaps Because thy cheeks excel their glowing hue. When thy assiduous lover offers thee. Pomona's boon, the mellow, fragrant apple, The mellow, fragrant apple thou refusest; Perhaps because thy bosom swells with fruit More tempting, and more exquisitely poignant. Alas! from me no tribute wilt thou take; When to propitiate thee I climb the rock, And of it's golden treasure rob the bee, The golden treasure thou wilt not accept. Disdainful nymph! perhaps because thy lip Is moistened with a more ambrosial dew. But if I'm poor, and cannot give thee aught, But what thou hast thyself in more perfection, I offer thee my person:—Scornful maid, By what pretext refusest thou this tender? I am not so unseemly, if aright I viewed myself of late in Neptune's mirror, When Æther was serene, and not a breeze Curled the smooth bosom of the glassy deep. My sanguine, hale complexion; my broad shoulders, My brawny arms with sinews prominent, My shaggy breast, and thighs thick-cloathed with hair, Give me not to thee for a mortal stripling, But prove the matchless vigour of a god. What dost thou hope from languid, beardless boys Who having nothing that deserves thy favour, Nothing substantial, nothing efficacious, Endeavour to promote their suit by trifles: Their dress, and hair composed with childish foppery: Mere females in appearance, and in strength. Suppose now such a tricked-out paramour Should o'er the mount, or through the wood attend thee, And meet a hungry wolf, or grisly boar; Say, for thy sake durst he oppose the savaged No; soon he would be seized with pallid fear, And soon the coward would desert his mistress; Hurried away by ignominious flight. I know I am not ugly; nor dost thou Despise me for my person and my face— No; 'tis because I'm poor—dire lust of gold! The tyrant reigns with universal sway, Is not confined to the rapacious city, It reaches stiller life, it haunts the village, It chases slumber from the peaceful cottage, And spreads it's influence o'er the whole creation. This would be justly named the age of gold: For nought but gold avails; and without gold Life stagnates; friendless, and deserted man Dies of the frozen gripe of penury. Even I, a god, feel poverty's effects. Accursed be he who first set love to sale! Cursed be his ashes! ne'er may nymph or swain In passing, pray the gods for his quietus, Or say—“Light lie the flowery turf on thee!” But may the beating rains, and the rough winds, And all the jarring elements of heaven, With vengeful storm unherse the bones, and tear them From earth's asylum; may the stranger's foot, Flocks, and unwieldy herds, trample the rubbish. Thou, base venality, the ugliest monster Of all that land, or ocean e'er produced, Didst first degrade the dignity of love; That noble passion, which can only flourish Enlivened by the smile of liberty. It cannot bear the supercilious brow Of stern restraint; whene'er the tyrant enters, It flies indignant from the grim intruder. But why these empty words?—befits it me Thus to lament my unsuccessful passion? Each being for it's use exerts the arms Which nature gave; the stag avails himself Of his swift feet; the lion with his paw, Terror and death unsheathing, gripes his prey, And scruples not to crush it; the fierce boar With whetted tusk destroys; nay even weak woman, So fearful in appearance, and so gentle, Kills with a look, or with a graceful motion, Whene'er she would extend her amorous empire. These rightly act as nature hath impressed them. And should I foolishly reject her bounty, And let her providence lie dead in me? No:—Since with strength resistless I'm endowed, I will employ that strength; I will extort The bliss which a capricious nymph denies me, As the just recompence of ardent love. A trusty goat-herd who for me observes The secret haunts and practices of Sylvia, Hath told me that it is her frequent custom, Tired with the chace, to seek a silver fountain, And there, unnoticed, as she thinks, to bathe Her snowy limbs in the translucent stream. I know the place; my vassal showed it me: Thither will I repair, and midst the shrubs And bushes lie concealed, and wait her coming. First will I feast upon her naked charms; Then, stung with love, and rage, rush out upon her. How shall a tender maid my fierce attack Baffle by opposition, or by flight? What will they prove against my strength, and swiftness? Her tears, her eloquence, inforced by beauty, Shall nought avail; I'll rifle all her charms; And after I will take more deep revenge. This vengeful hand I'll fasten in her locks; And with her blood I will distain the ground: Her pride shall pay the forfeit of her life; Her life the victim which my honour calls for: A puny mortal hath despised a god. For slighted tenderness is sure to find Just vindication from a generous mind; The bosom feels a new, destructive fire, Which deadens pity, but inflames desire. SCENE II. Daphne, and Thyrsis. DAPHNE. Thyrsis, I've long perceived Amyntas' flame For Sylvia; and heaven knows how oft I've warmly pleaded for the hapless swain. And I am ready with more earnestness To urge his interest now, since you espouse it. But trust me, I would rather undertake To tame the playful steer, the bear, the tiger, Than this same simple, foolish, beauteous girl, Who will not know the charms she is endowed with, The power, the bliss that heaven has lodged with woman; Yet kills, with all her childish heedlessness; Kills, though she hath not learned to take an aim. THYRSIS. Strange is her constitution—for thy sex Are busied from their infancy to know What dress, and manner best become their person, And all the arts that steal away the soul, Elaborate, and yet displayed with ease: To know to give a meditated death, Under the snare of trivial, airy pleasure; To know the whole machinery of love— To know what engines kill, what only wound; What lenitives assuage the lover's pain; What are the potent charms that bring him back From Pluto's confines to the golden day; From drooping nature to the bloom of health, And all the sweets of fancy's paradise. DAPHNE. You paint a curious art; say who bestows it? THYRSIS. Daphne, thy question is a female wile; Thou feignest ignorance to discover mine. Who taught the birds their musick, and their flight? Who taught the fish to swim, the ram to butt, The peacock to unfurl his glistening train? DAPHNE. What is the name of this surprizing teacher? THYRSIS. Daphne, the name. DAPHNE. False, ridiculing tongue! THYRSIS. Reject not quite my strong hyperbole: Thou an adept sufficient art in love, In all its mystery, to erect a school, And teach a thousand girls the pleasing system. Indeed the school by Nature is precluded; They have the science from her inspiration; Yet nature owes a part to education; The mother, and the nurse, improve her dictates; Open, and throw them into ready practice. DAPHNE. Come; you're a phlegmatick, a gloomy reasoner. I like not speculation; I will make A female, but a pertinent transition, And pass to woman's easy narrative. To tell thee truth, I question much that Sylvia Is in the tender art so unenlightened, As from her words, and conduct she appears. Her yesterday's behaviour caused my doubts. I chanced to find her near the spacious meadow, Adjacent to the city; in that meadow Thou knowest there is a small peninsula, Cloathed with a verdant turf, and gay with flowers; 'Tis almost by the large transparent lake Surrounded. By this lake was Sylvia seated; She stooped intently o'er the limpid mirror, Admiring, as I thought, her image there. She seemed consulting, too, the faithful water; How with most grace she might collect her hair, How best adorn it with the gifts of Flora, Which on her lap in rich profusion lay. She took by turns the lily, pink, and rose, And to her cheeks and neck by turns applied them, With vain comparison; a laugh succeeded Of self-complacency, of female triumph, Which might be thus translated into language. “Ye vanquished flowers, where is your boasted hue? Me nature hath suffused with brighter glow, I have no need of you; but I will wear you, Not for my ornament, but for your shame; Not that your active aid may push my conquests, Attract more notice from the swains, and pour A fuller lustre on the wondering eye; But that your beauties, drawing force no more, From the soft verdure of your mother-earth, Faded and sunk, may give relief to mine.” But while she thus was busied in admiring Her charms, and meditating future triumphs; She accidentally turned round, and saw me. She rose confused, let fall the flowers, and blushed. I laughed at her confusion; and my laugh Fluttered her more, and raised her deeper blushes. But as her art already had disposed Part of her hair, and part remained dishevelled; I could observe her sometimes steal a look To the clear water of sweet information, And smile to see her half embellished figure: For charms in negligence ne'er fail to please, Admit an infinite variety; nay, seem More free, and more expanded by disorder. I heedfully remarked these circumstances; Though at the time I seemed not to observe them. THYRSIS. By your account of Sylvia, my suspicions Are verified; did I not shrewdly guess? DAPHNE. You did—but can it be that human kind Had all this early craft in former days? No—when I was myself of Sylvia's age, I was a stranger quite to dark design; Simply I thought, and simply spoke, and acted. The world grows old; and growing old, grows worse: The world collectively, like individuals, Is chilled, and hardened by the hand of time; Loses the genial mellowness of nature, The vigorous flow of large philanthropy, Contracted, shrivelled, and locked up in self. THYRSIS. Perhaps in earlier times the human form Had not so much, within, the hungry wild beast; Went not so much abroad in quest of prey. Inhabitants of noisy capitals Sought not so oft our rural shades to breathe in, Cloyed with a multiplicity of pleasure, Smiting the healthy minds of cottagers With the contagion of distempered fancy. Nor did our country-girls so often seek The baleful atmosphere of publick life. Different the practice of our modern times: Man mixes universally with man; Hence man is universally corrupted. Life is disfigured; we but see the ruins Of our original unblemished nature.— Enough of this; say, canst thou not procure An interview with Sylvia, for Amyntas, Without a witness, or, at most with thee? DAPHNE. I know not; never did a simple girl Affect a shyness so reserved as Sylvia's. THYRSIS. And never girl so shy as Sylvia found A lover so respectful as Amyntas. DAPHNE. A lover too respectful, is a fool. Tell him to quit the hardy trade of love, Or lay aside that distant, timid homage. He that would practise the true art of love, Must quicken his respect with well timed courage. Let him be bold; and if he wants a favour, Solicit, importune; and if he finds Solicitation, importunity, Are feeble, ineffectual mediators; Let him embrace a gay, unguarded moment, To steal with dexterous theft the wished-for bliss. And if his circumspection cannot steal it; Let him risk all to win the golden prize, And seize it with a gallant violence. Women well know to wield their proper weapons; Or women would be blanks in the creation: It is not in their province to procure Protection and respect from selfish man By their strong influence in society. They have no hold of the proud, lordly being, Except the tender, silken bands of pleasure; And if their tension is not nice, they break. This tension is the politicks of love. We must not give, the moment you demand, Or we should nothing have worthy of giving. Would you enjoy? the way to your enjoyment Must not be plain; but you must climb and struggle To reach the arduous pinnacle of bliss. Great part of happiness precedes fruition, And mingles with the labour of acquiring. The trifling part the sensual organs give us, Is gross, and animal, and soon grows vapid; The finer part, which rises from the mind, Is lasting, active, spirit all, and æther, Worthy a being raised above the brutes. In every nerve it beats, through every pore It breathes, it's ardour buoys our mortal frame; It purifies, it subtilizes matter, And gives to man the pleasures of a god. It cheers existence in whatever state; Warms us on Caucasus, and on the line It fans us with a cool Italian breeze. We must not give the moment you demand, Or we should dwindle in your estimation From goddesses to despicable slaves. No, we must grant with coyness, and reserve, Not seemingly to gratify ourselves; But as a stately empress would vouchsafe Some signal favour to a trusty vassal. Thus do we keep our gentle majesty. Hence all the necessary tricks of love; We fly, and wish our swain may overtake us: When we refuse, we wish the thing requested By art or force, may be extorted from us; And when we struggle with a mock resistance, We wish that our resistance may be baffled. Thyrsis, to you I show, without reserve, The whole economy of female love. But have a care; repeat not what I've told you; And above all let not your wanton satire Lash, in keen verse, the government of women: You know I can in verse return the charge; Man for my satire is an ample field, And I am too a favourite of the Muses. THYRSIS. How canst thou think that I would let a word Escape this tongue, that would offend my friend? But I conjure thee, by that time when love Spoke his first language in those radiant eyes, That thou wouldst plead Amyntas' cause, and try To reconcile to life the dying swain. DAPHNE. Oh! what an adjuration thou hast thought of! How couldst thou make me thus approximate My past, for ever past, and present days! My gay, my blooming spring, and withering autumn! But say, how would you have me interpose? THYRSIS. I will not plan for you; be but resolved To serve my friend, and you will find the means. DAPHNE. There let the matter rest: Sylvia, and I, Such our agreement was, are soon to go To Cynthia's fountain; where the plane-tree forms O'er the clear element a quivering shade. There the tired huntresses are often seated, To catch the grateful coolness of the place. Sylvia to-day in that retreat will bathe Her snowy limbs in the translucent water. THYRSIS. What does this lead to? DAPHNE. What does it lead to, sayst thou? Is not a word a lecture to the wise? THYRSIS. I understand you; but I fear he has not Courage enough for amorous enterprize. DAPHNE. Then he should better brook his disappointments, And wait with patience till his mistress woos him. THYRSIS. Such is the merit of my friend Amyntas, That he almost deserves that condescension. DAPHNE. But let us wave Amyntas for the present: Let me awhile speak to the heart of Thyrsis. Hast thou with purpose stern, and unnatural, Determined ne'er to taste the joys of love? Thou hast not passed as yet the prime of life. Sure thirty summers have not flushed that face; And shouldst thou make thy fleeting, precious youth An indolent, an unenjoying period? For all life's other scenes, compared with love, Are trifling, and unsatisfactory; They're only children's unideal play; Like it they actuate not, and feed the heart, And spring it's vigour with a bolder tone: Nothing but love deserves the name of pleasure. THYRSIS. He who on love rushes not prematurely, Is not, for that, deserted by the God; He is not galled with love's asperities; And when it comes, it smoothly flows upon him. He lounges not, but waits for an occasion; Haply at last his prudence finds a maid Whose heart, susceptible, and sympathetic, In concord sweet revibrates to his own. Thus does the wary connoisseur in love, Taste all it's joys, and all it's pains elude; He 'scapes the prickles of the flower; he crops Nought but the sweets of that Arabian rose. DAPHNE. Man loves activity, and enterprize: The sweet unseasoned with a dash of bitter Is soon succeeded by satiety. THYRSIS. I rather would be satiate than oft stung With an inordinate and painful craving. DAPHNE. Not surely if you have a high regale: And if that high regale, when 'tis enjoyed, Impresses an Elysium on the memory, Raising the joy of every repetition. THYRSIS. But who possesses that celestial object, With whom he still is pleased, who still is pleasing; Who watches ever o'er her lover's bliss; Conspires with all his sentiments of joy, Jealous to send away none unfulfilled? DAPHNE. And pray what man can look for such a mate, Unless he diligently tries to find her? THYRSIS. The acquisition is worth seeking for: But oh! the search is dangerous; oft it brings us Nought but the keenest anguish in return. Thyrsis again will never be a lover, Till he finds love an easier situation, Exempted more from sighs, complaints, and tears: Enough I've sighed; enough I have complained; And therefore I have made a truce with love: Rashly to plunge into the fatal passion, I leave to confident, unpractised minds, To minds just entering on a world of woe. DAPHNE. Why would you prematurely cease to love, Before you've had your share of it's enjoyment? THYRSIS. Daphne, the large remainder of enjoyment, Which yet the prime of manhood promises, I rather would forego than pay it's price, It's usual price, inestimable quiet. DAPHNE. Involuntary love may mock your plan; May rise, and when he rises in the breast, He will not easily be argued down. THYRSIS. I keep aloof, at distance from the tyrant. DAPHNE. Unthinking mortal! who is far from love? All space he actuates, like almighty Jove; Pervades each atom of the universe. THYRSIS. Who fears, and flies him, certainly escapes him. DAPHNE. Would you pretend to fly a winged god? THYRSIS. At first by Providence's kind decree, Leaving it in our power to fly from ruin, He meditates attack with feeble wing. Short are the flights he takes, and near the ground. He beats, and flutters, like a captive sparrow, Which strives in vain to mount with shortened pinions, The cruel pastime of some idle boy. But if with love we trifle, and admit him To hazardous familiarity, Neglecting to repel his childish onset, He soon gains strength, he soon becomes our master. He haunts us waking, haunts us in our dreams; With vigorous flight bursts through the cottage window: If we seek shelter from his persecution In the remotest corner of a forest, We there elude not his pursuit; for there With eagle-wing he overtakes his prey. DAPHNE. But commonly too late we see our danger; We see it when in vain we would escape it; When Cupid hath ensured his victory. THYRSIS. You speak of unexperienced, easy victims. DAPHNE. Well Thyrsis, much I would rejoice to see Thy philosophick discipline subdued. And I protest, since thou dost arrogate The stag's velocity, and lynx's sight, If love should take thee, unprepared, and wound thee, I mean inflict a deep, tormenting wound, And thou shouldst come to Daphne for assistance, I would not stir my tongue, nor stir a finger, To mitigate thy cruel destiny. No, could a magick movement of my eye-brow, Thy nymph propitiate to thy tender suit, The magick eye-brow should not move to save thee. THYRSIS. What, Daphne, could you see me then expiring, And not stretch out a friendly hand to help me? But since you seem determined I shall love, Deign you to be the object of my love. Give me your hand; we from this day will vow Only to live to make each other happy. DAPHNE. I know your proffer is but irony. Yet much I question whether you deserve So good a mistress as you'd find in me. In general men are superficial fools; Admiring but the surface of our worth. An easy shape, fine face, and sparkling eye, Are all that strike their gross imagination, Impassive to superior mental beauty, THYRSIS. I was not jesting Daphne, but as you Are mistress of the theory of woman, You will, by rule, decline the first proposal. But if you seriously reject my tender, I will resolve to bid adieu to love. DAPHNE. Why shouldst thou, Thyrsis, bid adieu to love? Thy happy circumstances love invites: Love is of delicate and tender growth, By life's inclemencies 'tis nipped and blighted. To flourish in perfection, it demands The fostering ray of warm prosperity. You have been fortunate, you're blessed with affluence, And affluence is the soil for love to spring on. THYRSIS. Daphne, a Alphonso II. duke of Ferrara: Tasso had reason afterwards to think him a devil. Virgil made a god of a Roman emperour, upon a similar occasion. The Italians still look upon their dukes to be gods. god bestowed this affluence on me; For he shall ever be a god to me. By all our swains he should be deemed a god. 'Tis he whose lowing herds and bleating flocks, Are spread through Italy to either sea; They're pampered on our most luxuriant plains, And live more hardly on our Apennines. When first my patron to his service took me. He thus addressed his swain in words benign: “Thyrsis, let others guard from wolves, and robbers My well-fenced folds; let others to my servants Justly dispense rewards and punishments; Let others feed my flocks, and have the charge Of milk, and wool, and all the rural stores: Let finer objects fill thy tuneful mind, And vacant be it's powers to sacred song.” Whence it is meet I should employ my genius On themes sublimer than terrestrial love; And strive to celebrate in sounding strains The ancestors of my divinity; Whether my Phœbus, or my Jove to deem him, I know not, for his attributes resemble Both deities; a mighty master he, A guardian of celestial poesy; A friend, a benefactor of mankind. Hence to our woods I oft commit the deeds Of Cœlus, and of Saturn; and he deigns With ear propitious to receive my verse; Whether in simple Doric mode I chant it, Or with the nobler powers of harmony. Not that himself I e'er presume to sing; The fittest homage he can have from me, Is mute admiring reverence; yet his altar, Shall oft be strewed with my devoted flowers; And often there shall my religious incense Exhale in fragrant odour to the skies. And when this holy gratitude forsakes me, All nature shall renounce it's present course: The stag shall quit the lawns, and seek the sky; Rivers shall backwards to their fountains flow, Shall be transported from their native channels; The Persian drink the Soane, the Gaul the Tigris. DAPHNE. Thyrsis, you mount: you grow enthusiastick; You wander from the theme of your discourse. THYRSIS. This is our point; when to Diana's spring You go with Sylvia, try to molify her, Try to subdue her stubborn soul to love. Meanwhile it shall be mine to school Amyntas, And fit him for a gallant enterprize. My task is no less difficult than yours. Daphne, the time is precious; prithee, go. DAPHNE. I go; yet once again I must remind thee, The theme of our discourse thou hast neglected. THYRSIS. If by the distance I am not deceived, I see Amyntas come this way; 'tis he. Venus, and Cupid animate my friend To use the means conducive to his end; To action rouze his timorous, plaintive heart, For passion is not all the lover's part. SCENE III. Amyntas and Thyrsis. AMYNTAS. Thyrsis, I come to know my destiny. And if thy kind endeavours nought avail To soothe the fate of thy unhappy friend, I am resolved to bleed in Sylvia's presence, The cruel cause of all my tender woes; She, who rejoices thus to see me wither, Soul-smitten by the lightning of her eye; My irremediable death will sure enjoy, Will sure enjoy the last, decisive blow. THYRSIS. Amyntas, drop these idle lamentations; They never gain a step: put on the man. I bring thee tidings that should comfort thee. AMYNTAS. What are the tidings? Speak; I'm on the rack! Art thou a messenger of life, or death? THYRSIS. A messenger of life, and happiness; Provided thou hast firmness to procure them. In short, to gain the blessings I announce, Thou must assume a dauntless resolution. Reflect on Providence's ways to man. The goods best worth our acquisition are The fruits of courage, toil, and perseverance. These rugged avenues to life's first treasures, Enhance our value of the great possessors, Making their well-earned glory venerable. If sacrilegiously they could be snatched With hand profane, and yield to mere volition, Then would the soul supine, by lavish nature Stored with the seeds of flowery sentiment, Wanton in vigorous, and immortal strains, Without the necessary, happy labour; And knaves exchanging vice for easy virtue, Rise in a moment to divine perfection. Love likewise must be brave, and persevering. AMYNTAS. Thy eloquence ill-timed bespeaks the danger Extreme that I must undergo to win My cruel fair; but out with it at once; I'll meet it with a violence as great As all it's horror can affront me with. THYRSIS. Suppose thy mistress in a lonely wood; That lonely wood on every side hommed in With precipices and mishapen rocks; Those rocks resounding to the lion's roar, Those rocks the dreadful haunts of prowling tigers; Say, to redeem her thence couldst thou defy The rock mishapen, and the prowling savage? AMYNTAS. Thyrsis, I'd thither go, bold and secure, With foot as fearless as when I betake me To rural pastime on a festal day. THYRSIS. Suppose thy Sylvia was a prey to robbers, To robbers armed and desperate: wouldst thou dare The ruffians to attack for her deliverance? AMYNTAS. Would I attack them? Yes, with that assurance, Yes, with that eagerness, with which the stag His thirst appeases at the purling fountain. THYRSIS. Expect some greater proof; you must display In warmer terms your amorous heroism. AMYNTAS. Thyrsis, I'd for my Sylvia cross the river, When the relenting snow gorges its torrent, In cataracts descending from the Alps;— Thyrsis, I'd for my Sylvia tread the flame; I'd go to Pluto's realms in quest of Sylvia. Indeed no trial that: for Sylvia's presence Would make grim Pluto and his kingdom smile; Her eye would dissipate the gloom of hell, It's anguish heal, and change it to Elysium. Oh tell me quickly all I am to know! THYRSIS. Hear then— AMYNTAS. —But trifle not; tell it me briefly. THYRSIS. Sylvia awaits thee at Diana's fountain, Alone, and naked; will the timorous lover, Let slip the golden opportunity? AMYNTAS. What are the words that strike my ravished ear; Does Sylvia wait for me alone, and naked? THYRSIS. Perhaps too Daphne may be there; but she You know, with all her art assists your love. AMYNTAS. Does she await me naked, says my Thyrsis? THYRSIS. Naked, I say, she doth await thee—but— AMYNTAS. That cruel but, and hesitation kill me. THYRSIS. She knows not that you are to find her there. AMYNTAS. Oh! galling end of a delusive tale! It turns all the preceding sweets to bitter! Inhuman Thyrsis, how dost thou torment me! Thou shouldst pour balm into my bleeding wound; Instead of that thou woundest me afresh, Causing my former wound to smart, and fester. Art thou my friend, or hast thou human nature? Thou seest me overwhelmed with misery; My load of misery seems to be thy sport; Instead of striving to alleviate it, With barbarous hand thou pressest down the burden. THYRSIS. If thou art ruled by me thou wilt be happy. AMYNTAS. What is the counsel thou wouldst give me?— THYRSIS. Go; Be bold; avail thyself of this occasion. AMYNTAS. Kind heaven forbid that I should e'er commit Deliberate act that would offend my Sylvia! I ne'er offended her but by my passion; I could not blame myself for that; it was Involuntary, irresistible: Blame we the trembling, and obedient string, That speaks, in musick, to the lyrist's finger? Kind heaven forbid that I should e'er offend her, By any action on myself depending. THYRSIS. Amyntas, answer me ingenuously: Supposing thou couldst quit thy passion for her; Tell me, that passion wouldst thou quit to please her? AMYNTAS. No, though I could, I would not cease to love her; Love will not let me harbour such an image; Oh! 'tis a cold, and bleak one! to my mind It makes the universe a dreary waste. THYRSIS. Then you confess in spight of her you'd love her; Though in your power it were to cease your passion? AMYNTAS. No—not in spight of her—yet I would love her— THYRSIS. But as the case is put, you own you'd love her Against her will? AMYNTAS. Why—yes—against her will. THYRSIS. Why will you then refuse, against her will, To show a hardiness, which though, at first, It may displease her virgin-modesty, In time may be thy powerful advocate, Soften her breast with tender imagery, And give thee love's complete reciprocation! AMYNTAS. I cannot answer thee; yet I'm inspired; Even now I feel love speaking to my heart, In torrents of tumultuous eloquence. My struggling tongue more forcibly describes The strong, and varied feelings of my soul Than the most copious orator could paint them. But thou art versed in all love's intricacies, And use hath made the theme familiar to thee. THYRSIS. And will you then not go? AMYNTAS. Yes, I will go; But whither thou wouldst have me go, I will not. THYRSIS. Whither, Amyntas, wilt thou go? AMYNTAS. To death; If this is all thy friendship can effect, To make my life wear a more chearful aspect. THYRSIS. And dost thou think that I effect so little? Dost thou despise this opportunity? Thou art a simple, poor, despairing lover. Would Daphne have suggested this adventure, Had she not seen a glimpse of Sylvia's heart, Seen that it was disposed to favour thee? 'Tis probable she knows thy mistress loves thee, But by her plighted word perhaps is bound Not to reveal the secret of her friend. Were it not for thy stature, I'd suppose Thou just hadst left the cradle: dost thou wish She would in terms express declare her passion? But surely thou must know the declaration Would ill agree with Sylvia's bashful nature. What circumstance would more offend her pride, Than if she knew you harboured such desire; And yet you'd rather perish than offend her; If she would rather that you should be happy By artful theft, or bolder violence, To you what difference is there how you win Your happiness, provided you are happy? AMYNTAS. Who can assure me that my Sylvia wishes I'd undertake this love's knight-errantry? THYRSIS. Thou inconsistent man!—Bewitching passion! Thy fascination dwindles manly reason To the low, captious fancy of a child! Again I tell thee, love is kept alive By dangers, and by difficulties; Without their necessary animation, It loses all it's spirit, it grows dead. Sylvia in thought thou dreadest to offend; And yet, thou torpid lover, thou wouldst have Certain anticipation of success; Which, if she knew thou hadst, it would, most justly, Against thee raise her keenest indignation. Consider, though futurity is doubtful, Yet thou mayst prosper in thy enterprize: If then thou mayst, go boldly, and atchieve it. For thy success is hazarded as much By dull inaction as by brave attempt. And if, all thy endeavours nought availing. To soften Sylvia's heart, thou needs must die; Adorn thy death by some adventurous deed; So shall the swains revere thy memory: Timorous, or brave in love, thou canst but die; Die bravely then; if thou embracest death (And voluntary death bespeaks a mind Of vigorous tone, and fit for great resolves) Let it not, following tears, and puny whining, Throw ridicule upon thy tragic story. Thy silence tells me reason hath prevailed; Her power thou feelest; own, and be convinced That thou at length art foiled in argument; A surer victory wilt thou gain in love. Go fearless to thy nymph. AMYNTAS. Yet stay awhile. THYRSIS. Why stay awhile? the rapid wing of time Stays not a moment. AMYNTAS. Let us yet consider If I should execute this bold design, And how I should conduct it. THYRSIS. As we go We'll frame the measures for it's execution. Since life's most eligible scenes contain, With certain pleasure, their contingent pain; The prudent man a steddy course will steer, 'Twixt rash presumption, and desponding fear: Nothing is certain in our earthly state; A seeming trifle may be big with fate. But if we always are afraid to stir, Lest from our aim by moving we should err; If all our projects die of cold delay, Like a fixed, withering plant, we pine away; No solid satisfaction can we share, Our life a series of inactive care. CHORUS. Say, love, what master shows thy art, That sweet improver of mankind, Which warms with sentiment the heart, With information stores the mind? Whence does the soul, disdaining earth, To Æther wing it's ardent way; Who gives the bold expressions birth, That all it's images convey? 'Tis not to Greece's learned soil The world this happy culture owes; Which not from Aristotle's toil Nor yet from Plato's fancy flows. Apollo, and the tuneful Nine, Attempt the envied song in vain; Their numbers are not so divine, As is the lover's tender strain. Scholastick art, the Muse's lyre, In vain their privileges boast: The lover breathes a purer fire; He sings the best who feels the most. No power above, and none below, But thou, O love! can thee express; To thee thy sentiments we owe; To thee we owe their glowing dress. Thou canst refine the simple breast, And to a poet raise a swain; His humble soul, by thee impressed, Assumes a warm, exalted strain. His manners take a nobler turn; His inspiration we descry; Upon his cheek we see it burn, And speak, in lightning, from his eye. With such a new, ideal store Thy dictates fill the rustick mind; Such oratory shepherds pour, They leave a Cicero far behind. Nay, to such heights thy powers can reach, With thee such varied rhetorick dwells, That even the struggling, broken speech The modelled period far excels. Thy silence oft, in striking pause, The lover's great ideas paints Sublime conception is its cause: The mind expands, but language faints. Free, uncompressed the thought appears, Which words would aukwardly controul; And nature holds our eyes, and ears; We seem to hear, and see the soul. The lettered youth let Plato's page With generous sentiment inspire; I'm better taught than by a sage, And catch a more ethereal fire. A nobler, and a speedier aid My virtue gains from Cælia's eyes: By them more happy I am made: And as I'm happy, I am wise. Let the mistaken world suppose That nature in old Homer reigns; Or, still more blindly thinks she flows In Virgil's cold, and laboured strains. I carve my love upon a tree; Scholars consult it's faithful rind: Throw books away, for there you'll see A livelier copy of the mind. End of the second Act. ACT III. SCENE I. Thyrsis and Chorus. THYRSIS. Oh! cruel, fortune; Oh! inhuman Sylvia! Oh! barbarous woman-kind! and thou dame Nature, How negligently hast thou formed the sex! How couldst thou spurn thy salutary laws, And e'er give birth to such incongruous being? Thou hast for them thy softest matter chosen, And wrought it to enchanting elegance, Bespeaking timid mildness, sweet compliance; Yet, strange to tell! this perfect symmetry Contains, within, a brood of savage passions: Angels in body; but in soul they're demons! Thou, kind preserver of each other species, Hast tempted man to rush on his destruction! My friend Amyntas sure hath slain himself. I've diligently sought him where I left him, And in the parts adjacent; but in vain; He certainly hath done what oft he threatened. I see some shepherds, I'll inquire of them; They may perhaps give me some tidings of him. Friends, tell me, have you lately seen Amyntas; Or some news of him you perhaps have heard? CHORUS. Thyrsis, thou seemest in extreme confusion: Thou breathest quick; art thou pursued, or chasing? What is the cause of all this agitation? Tell us, that, if we can, we may remove it. THYRSIS. I fear some evil hath befallen Amyntas: Say, have you seen him? CHORUS. Since he left this place Some time ago, with thee, we have not seen him: But why art thou so fearful for Amyntas? THYRSIS. Because I fear he hath destroyed himself. CHORUS Destroyed himself! canst thou assign the cause? THYRSIS. The cause was hapless love, and fell despair. CHORUS. When they together rankle in the breast, Two dreadful enemies are they to man. But pray be more explicit in thy story. THYRSIS. Most ardently the shepherd loved a nymph; And for his love that nymph returned disdain. CHORUS. Thy hints raise eager curiosity; Wilt thou at large unfold this mournful tale? This place is much frequented; some may pass, Who in the interim may inform us of him: Or possibly himself may come this way. THYRSIS. I'll willingly be more particular. For such ingratitude should not escape Without it's recompense of infamy. These lines recall to my mind a passage in Xenophon, the quotation of which may be agreeable to the reader. The Persians take rigid cognizance of the charge of ingratitude, a crime which renders a man extremely odious; yet not in any country but Persia is it comprehended in the animadversion of the laws. For the Persian who returns not a good office, when he has it in his power, is most severely punished. They conclude that the ungrateful man must pay no regard to his friends, to his relations, to his parents, to his country, or to the gods. Besides, they think he must immediately become impudent in consequence of his ingratitude; and impudence they deem the forerunner of all vice, and profligacy. Cyropædia, Book I.Ingratitude! that bold, licentious monster, That tramples on the tenderest rights of man! The fiend stalks impudently in the sunshine; It plumes itself on it's unpunished treason; It is not hunted down by human laws; Therefore the heart's tribunal should arraign it: It calls, at least, for virtue's detestation; And nature's organ should distinctly tell it: It is the outcast of the great Creator. Excuse my feelings for my injured friend; I now leave passion, and take up narration. Amyntas knew that Sylvia was to go To bathe with Daphne at Diana's fountain. He knew, alas! by me, and I had spurred The timid swain to amorous enterprize. Sore do I now repent my rash advice. Thither he went, not led by inclination, But by my importunity subdued. He went reluctant, hesitating, fearful; Nay he would have turned back, had it not been For my remonstrances, and ridicule. Soon as the fountain we approached, we heard A piercing cry of female lamentation; And Daphne we beheld a moment after, Clapping her hands, frantic with grief, and terror; Who soon as she perceived us, called aloud, “Shepherds, your help; a monster forces Sylvia.” The fond Amyntas, on the dreadful notice, Sprung, like an arrow, to the maid's assistance, And I, with all my swiftness, followed him. A sight we saw, shocking to generous natures: We saw the fair Sylvia fastened to a tree, Naked, and bound with her luxuriant hair: Her hair with many a knot the nymph confined. Her zone, the guardian of her virgin bosom, Was now an implement of violence; And roughly manacled her lily-hands. The tree's young shoots fettered her tender limbs. This was not all; we saw before her standing An ugly Satyr; who had just completed His preparation of the beauteous victim. Much the fair captive struggled; but in vain; What could such weakness do against such strength! Amyntas had a dart with which he flew, Fierce as a hungry lion, to the Satyr: I snatched up stones to fight the sylvan ruffian; Who, seeing our enraged resistance, flew, And to the bosom of the wood betook him. Amyntas now had time to think of Sylvia. And first an amorous look he stole (what shepherd In such a case could amorous look refrain?) To which a smooth and snowy frame invited; Yet the respect attending sacred virtue, However poor, and naked in externals, Chastised the ardour of the lover's eye. A burning crimson overspread her face, The flame of violated modesty. Advancing towards her with gentle pace, By steps too hasty fearing to offend her, He thus in humble suit accosted her: “Oh! Sylvia think not my respectful hand Presumptuous, if it now comes near thy body: For near thee it must come to set thee free; It trembles at the delicate approach. And Oh! abate of thy severity; And grudge me not the happiness which fortune, So cruel hitherto, at length vouchsafes me.” CHORUS. How did these moving words affect the maid? THYRSIS. She to these moving words no answer gave, But with a blushing, and disdainful aspect, Turned to the ground her eyes; with strong contortion Endeavouring to conceal her lovely bosom. He now began to loose her golden hair; And to her virgin-bashfulness the task He softened with these tender sentiments: “And art thou, tree, worthy of so much honour? How are these ringlets misapplied! not meant To noose this lifeless trunk, this rugged substance: The pride of nature for a worthier purpose, To captivate the lover's feeling soul!” He next the girdle which confined her hands Untied in aukward, dilatory manner, That showed his fear, and his desire to touch them. But when he stooped, the fetters to untwist That bound her limbs: she said, in angry tone, “Shepherd, keep off thy sacrilegious hands; I'm a chaste virgin of Diana's train; Enough thou hast presumed; my hands are free, With them I'll set my feet at liberty.” CHORUS. Dwells there such haughtiness in rural breasts? Harsh retribution to a generous deed! THYRSIS. Forthwith Amyntas reverently withdrew: As soon as he received the stern dismission, He did not suffer even his eye to linger, To steal at parting, a luxurious view. I stood concealed amongst the neighbouring trees, And saw, and overhead the whole adventure. This cruel treatment fired me with resentment, And ready was my tongue for exclamation. Her feet now rid of their impediments, Which with great difficulty was effected, Away she ran, swift as a hunted deer; As if she just had left the frightful Satyr, And not Amyntas, her obsequious lover. CHORUS. Why did she fly so fast? THYRSIS. Her niggard soul Rather to flight her safety chose to owe, Than to her shepherd's generosity. CHORUS. Another mark of her ingratitude! But tell us how your hapless friend resented This humour, such as ne'er before I heard of. THYRSIS. Alas! I know not; for impelled with rage, I tried to overtake the fugitive, That by detaining her, I might torment Her pride again, and load her with reproaches, Such as I'd only give ingratitude: But vain was my pursuit; I lost her soon; The labyrinth of the wood secured her from me. I to the spot where this adventure happened Straightway returned, but could not find Amyntas. My boding heart presages some disaster. Oft did the melancholy swain imagine Before this accident, that he would find No friendly shelter from adversity, But in the quiet, gloomy shade of death. Thither, I fear, he hath at length retired. CHORUS. Oh! 'tis the way with disappointed lovers To talk of dying; but they seldom bleed; Protecting nature, kinder than the fair, Keeps them in love with life, and wards the blow: Rare, very rare, are the determined victims. THYRSIS. Amyntas, I'm afraid, is one of them. CHORUS. Fear not; thy friendship gives a false alarm. THYRSIS. I'll hasten to the cave of sage Elpinus: Thither for consolation he is gone, If he's alive; none fitter than Elpinus To heal the wounded soul with virtuous counsel, And raise it with the powers of harmony. In awful solitude his cave is seated; Nature improves the scene with various sweets, Romantic in her garb; and attitudes. These objects banish care, they set us loose From mean attachments, and compose our souls For fine impressions, and for heavenly airs: But when the god-like bard, his flute inspiring, Pours the melodious, sounding, varied strain; We then participate an angel's nature; 'Tis nought but extasy, poetic vision. Nor is it man alone that feels the charm: It draws the sluggish, latent soul from rocks; They listen, and they soften at the lay; To milk are mellowed all the neighbouring rills, And honey from the rugged oak distills. SCENE II. Amyntas, Daphne, Nerina. AMYNTAS. Daphne, thy pity was barbarity; Thy hand my enemy that checked the dart. And when I've formed the manly rosolution, Why should I shrink, and cling again to life? By lengthening life, I only suffer more. And why dost thou, who art my friend, amuse me With a delusive maze of argument? Why dost thou cheat me into life, and make The painted bubble Hope thus dance before me? Daphne, there is more force, more genuine truth In our strong feelings, our immediate sense, Than in the waste of flowery eloquence, And all the fopperies of the coxcomb, Reason. DAPHNE. Do not despair, Amyntas; if I know Of Sylvia aught, it was not cruelty, But shame, that caused her late behaviour to thee. AMYNTAS. Thou art a true physician; thou wouldst have Thy love-sick patient dwindle on in torment. Again thou offerest me false consolation, A pleasing antidote against my welfare: Despair alone can be my remedy; A bitter, but a salutary medicine. The specious liar, Hope, hath been my ruin: Again I feel it rising in my breast; It often faints, but still resumes its vigour; Nay, when 'tis quite extinct, it lives again; The merest trifle can restore it's being. Nay, what it's bane should be, it's cordial proves! Why do I hope? because I live; alas! What evil greater than a life like mine! DAPHNE. For shame, support your misery like a man; Live on in misery; nay, with future bliss Contrast it, and convert it to your pleasure. Who never suffers, never can enjoy; He only dozes on a bed of down; Pleasure's acutest point can hardly wake him. But he whose frame, originally fine, Is wrought still finer by adversity, In better days, feels all their genial sun-shine; His path is strewed with amaranths, and roses; Elysium's glory opens on his eyes; His ears are ravished with celestial musick: What to the wallowing hog of Epicurus Is bare convenience, is to him enjoyment: No particle of happiness goes past him. Live then, and hope; and your reward shall be Those naked beauties which you lately saw. AMYNTAS. Why am I galled again with that idea? Fortune, and love, my unrelenting foes, Held forth the treasure to my longing view, Of which they ne'er will grant me the fruition, Only to render me completely wretched. NERINA. Alas! must I then be the croaking raven Of melancholy news! Ah! poor Montanus! What will thy feelings be, when thou shalt hear Thy Sylvia's cruel fate, thy only daughter! DAPHNE. Amyntas, dont you hear the voice of woe? AMYNTAS. Yes; and I likewise hear the name of Sylvia; It strikes my ear, and sets my heart a-beating. Say, dost thou know the voice? DAPHNE. Yes, 'tis Nerina's; A favourite of Diana; famous too For her fine hand, and for her sparkling eye, Her easy shape, and her engaging manner. NERINA. Yet he should know the mournful accident; For he would wish to gather her remains, If any can be found: Oh! hapless Sylvia! AMYNTAS. What can this be? What does this woman say? NERINA. Oh Daphne! DAPHNE. Whence, Nerina, this confusion? Why speakest thou of Sylvia with a sigh? NERINA. Alas! her fate the deepest sigh demands! AMYNTAS. What dost thou mean? thou overwhelmest me; My heart is freezing, and my life goes from me: I dare not ask; yet say, doth Sylvia live? DAPHNE. Speak; be explicit; let us know the worst. NERINA. Why should I be a doleful messenger? But now I must unfold the dreadful tale. Sylvia came naked to my habitation; Why she came so, I need not tell Amyntas. As soon as she was dressed, she begged I would A-hunting with her go to Elicetum. Thither we went, and many nymphs we found Assembled, by appointment, for the chace. We had not long been there, when a fierce wolf From covert rushed; enormous was his size; And from his jaws a bloody foam distilled. Forthwith the dexterous Sylvia took her aim, And in the neck her arrow wounded him. Howling he fled into the deepest wood; And Sylvia, brandishing a dart, pursued him. AMYNTAS. Dreadful is the beginning of thy story; I'm on the rack; it bodes a horrid end. NERINA. I likewise had a dart, and followed with it; But soon in the pursuit I lagged behind; Sylvia's agility surpasses mine. I lost my objects, but I still advanced; And hoping to recover them, I wandered Through many a winding of the thickest wood. But in my search a dreadful sight alarmed me; The dart of Sylvia on the ground I saw; And near it I beheld her snowy veil, Which my own hands adjusted to her head. Examining the ground with eager eyes, A scene of greater horrour I surveyed; I saw seven hungry wolves feasting on blood; And near it, stripped of flesh, some bones lay scattered. Intent upon their prey, they spied not me, So fortunate I was: I hied me back, Sore dreading for my friend, and spurred with fear. No fuller tidings can I give of Sylvia; Each monument of a departed friend Is dear; her veil I brought; lo! here it is. AMYNTAS. No fuller tidings! thou hast told enough! Oh! blood, Oh! veil, Oh! Sylvia, thou art dead! DAPHNE. He faints; the sudden shock of grief hath stopped The springs of life! I fear he too is dead. NERINA. Fear not, he breathes; nature but makes a pause, His colour is returning; he recovers. AMYNTAS. Oh! Grief, thou art a cruel, slow tormentor! Wilt thou ne'er rid me of a painful life! For my own hand reservest thou the office? It willingly accepts it; by its blow, It's speedy, and decisive blow, I'll pass At once to that desirable quietus From human misery, which thou, trifling mocker, Refusest me, or hast not force to give! And since I, from Nerina's deathful tongue, Hear that appalling certainty, which makes Desponding nature sink before it dies; Since life, which way soe'er I turn myself, Is waste, and rugged, all; no nook now left For blooming hope to vegetate upon, Why should I longer stay, what do I wait for? O Daphne, 'tis to thy mistaken friendship I owe the knowledge of this tragedy! Thou hast officiously prolonged my life, Only to arm my death with tenfold horrour. Thy hand the seasonable blow prevented, Which would have crowned my death with tender fame; By one determined act I should have fallen, A gallant sacrifice to slighted love. I should have been imbalmed with elegy; Some swain, more favoured than the rest by Phœbus, My story would have sung in deathless verse; He would have given me, with departed lovers, A fragrant mansion in the myrtle grove, Nor should I then have died reluctantly. So fondly do we cling to life, we fancy, That, when we're dead, we still exist in others, Whom we have left behind. Thus leaving Sylvia, Thinking that she would long be well, and happy; And thinking (vain perhaps the thought had been) That for Amyntas she would drop a tear, I had from life to death an easy passage; 'Twas bidding but the world a slight adieu. But now with what ideas shall I die? For die I must; I am resolved to die. The beauteous object of my passion dead, Torn limb from limb by hungry, ravenous wolves, Her soul breathed out in agony, and horrour! No image left to substitute my being! Oh! with what grimness death now stalks before me! I leave thee, cruel world; ere long, Amyntas Shall be to thee as he bad never been! Oh! 'tis a blank farewel! it numbs the soul; It almost kills without the fatal blow. That I now feel this last, this worst distress, I owe to fortune, and to thee, O Daphne! Thou hast been only my unthinking friend; But she was ever my deliberate foe. But now the wished-for crisis sure is come; Now have I reached the extremity of woe; Fortune must now be willing to dismiss me, Tired, or unable to distress me more: And thou too, Daphne, wilt, at length, from friendship, Assent that I should manumit my soul, Too long a tortured prisoner in this body. DAPHNE. Thy grief, and wild despair shut out thy reason; As yet the tale is not completely known; Live yet awhile, till thou hast learned the whole. AMYNTAS. Alas! too long I've lived; too much I've learned. NERINA. I wish that Providence had struck me dumb Ere I began to tell this dismal story. AMYNTAS. Give me that veil, Nerina, I intreat thee; 'Twas Sylvia's; therefore it is dear to me. It's company will give me strength to go My small remaining part of life's rough way. A feeling soul, impoverished, and afflicted, Is wont on trifles to recline itself, And from them draws a melancholy pleasure. If 'tis not blasphemy, to call a trifle, What left behind a mistress, or a friend, Is hallowed by a warm imagination. It will encourage me to undertake, With resolution, the last, painful task; 'Twill be my best viaticum; and cheer My fluttering soul upon her dreary passage. NERINA. Say, Daphne, must I give it, or refuse it? The motives that induce him to request it, Persuade me strongly to withhold it from him. AMYNTAS. And wilt thou cruelly this little boon Refuse me, now I'm on the verge of life? Even to life's verge doth fortune persecute me. I to her uniformity resign; Keep it; and Heaven's protection keep you both; I go from whence I never shall return. DAPHNE. Amyntas, stop, and hear me—no, he's gone; With what a fury hath he flung away! NERINA. So swift he flies we cannot overtake him: I'll then pursue my way, and to Montanus I'm now resolved not to unfold this tale, Till certainty shall warrant it's recital. For since my blabbing tongue, too late, I find, Hath raised a whirlwind in the lover's mind, Which, I'm afraid, death will alone assuage, More tender let me be to hoary age. CHORUS. The virtues of the rural shade Are often raised beyond their aim; And oft the shepherd, and the maid, Intent on love, are crowned with fame. Blest swains, exempt from care, and pain; For nature plans your peaceful state; Free from ambition, yet you gain More warm encomiums than the great! You shall without a hardy deed Be severed from the human throng; You need not idly wish to bleed That you may live in sacred song. Let constant love adorn your life; Be constant innocence your guard; Which most is yours, be all your strife; And which is most it's own reward. And then expect another prize; Expect the poet's deathless lays; Just debts, which oft the world denies, The heaven-instructed poet pays. His tribute shall the hero share, Too prodigal of human kind, Where lofty strains, and honour's glare Cheat into eulogy the mind? Sure then, ye swains, he will rehearse Your better lives, unstained with blood; For here the salutary verse, While it delights us, makes us good. ACT IV. SCENE I. Daphne, Sylvia, Chorus. DAPHNE. My Sylvia, may propitious winds disperse The false report of thy unhappy fate; If any ill is now impending o'er thee, Oh! may they quickly waft it far away, And from my friend repel each future evil. I see thee well; thanks to protecting Heaven! But never did I think to see thee more: So dreadful was the news Nerina brought us. Would she had lost her speech, or we our hearing! SYLVIA. My danger certainly was very great; Strong were the grounds she had to think me dead. DAPHNE. But it was foolish, it was cruel in her, To shock us with her premature account: But now our spirits are composed; pray tell me The nature of the danger you were in, And how, by Providence, 'twas only danger. SYLVIA. Into the wood I chased, with warm pursuit, A wolf enormous, wounded by my arrow: But soon I lost him in it's intricacies. On my return this wolf again I spied; I could not be mistaken; for the dart, With which I pierced his neck, was still lodged there. With other wolves I saw him o'er a carcase, I know not of what animal, so much By their rapacity it's form was mangled. The savage seemed to know his adversary; For to me straight he flew with bloody jaw. I failed not to assume my wonted courage; A dart I brandished, ready for the charge. Thou knowest my address, and that my aim But seldom wanders from the destined object. I seized the juncture of his proper distance, And launched my javelin; but the javelin erred; It missed the wolf; and smote a neighbouring tree: A fiercer onset now he meditated; A baleful fire glared in his angry eye; And with keen tusks he churned the whitened foam. To flight I took me; for I had no arms; And with as eager pace did he pursue me. Hear now an accident, by which my flight Was interrupted, and my fear augmented. The veil came loose, in which my hair was fastened; And waving, as I ran precipitately, It was entangled in a branch: I felt That something stopped my course; but what it was I did not recollect, through headlong fear. I freed myself by one impetuous spring; But with my veil some hair I left behind. Fear winged my feet with such a rapid flight, That I escaped the raging wolf's pursuit, Soon cleared the forest, and got safely home. O'erjoyed I was again to meet my Daphne; Though I was struck to see thee gaze upon me, As if affrighted to behold thy friend. DAPHNE. Thou livest; but we are not all alive. SYLVIA. Daphne, what meanest thou; dost thou regret That from the jaws of death I have escaped? Can Sylvia's welfare give her Daphne pain? DAPHNE. No surely; I rejoice to see thou livest; But we have lost a friend; for him I grieve. SYLVIA. Whom have we lost? DAPHNE. Amyntas is no more SYLVIA. Amyntas is no more?—How did he die? DAPHNE. I know not how; nor dare I to assert That he is dead; but 'tis too probable. SYLVIA. What is it that I hear? I'm thunder-struck; To what dost thou impute his death? DAPHNE. To thine. SYLVIA. I know not what thou meanest. DAPHNE. Of thy death He heard the hasty news, and he believed it. And this belief hath driven him to self-slaughter; Or by the noose, or dagger he hath died, Or other implement of desperate love. SYLVIA. Thy apprehension of his death is vain, As vainly thou didst fear that I was dead. However harsh the cup of life may be, We still love life; 'tis nature's general law; We fret, and we complain; sometimes despair, And with our threats alarm our fearful friends; But commonly these agitations end In shrinking back into ourselves, and living on. DAPHNE. O Sylvia, Sylvia, little dost thou know How love torments a heart of flesh and blood; For thine is petrified, and cannot feel: And how can an obdurate, barren soul Be struck with pictures which it ne'er imagines! Would we these pictures to that soul explain? 'Tis to the blind man to harangue on colours; 'Tis to the deaf to teach the charms of musick. For hadst thou been of sympathetick mould, Thou wouldst have loved this warm and constant shepherd More than thy visual orb; that little mirrour At which thou takest in the fair creation; More than the spirit which informs thy body. Alas! I have but too substantial grounds To fear, nay, to be sure, that he is dead. When from the Satyr he had rescued thee, And with such cruelty when thou hadst left him, Too well I marked the frenzy of his love. A dart's keen point he to his breast directed, Determined by despair to urge it forwards. I the rash act prevented; but the weapon Was with his blood distained, before I seized it. And if I had not checked it opportunely, It would have then transfixed that faithful heart, Which thy inhuman rigour hath pierced through With a more painful wound, and no less fatal. Yet though thou then wast naked, I must tell thee, Thou wouldst have done much honour to thy sex, If, out of gratitude, thou hadst embraced him. Our souls should sometimes point us out decorum; Tis in nice cases too refined for rules; As equity sometimes takes place of law. Mechanick motion leave to vulgar souls; Leave them to coxcombs, to coquettes and prudes; For these disfigurements of human kind Are copied from the cities into hamlets. The prude, by many lessons from her glass, Her look, originally warm, and lewd, Converts to chastity's severest winter. The gay coquette elaborately flutters; Her easy airs are the result of study: The coxcomb languishes, and dies by art. Not so the simple, generous, virtuous mind; 'Tis better taught, and takes it's cue from nature. SYLVIA. Oh! I repent my treatment of Amyntas! DAPHNE. Sufficient reason hast thou to repent; For when he heard the tidings of thy death, Forthwith he fainted; soon as he recovered, Away he went in desperate, frantic mood; And surely he hath struck the fatal blow. SYLVIA. What, art thou sure? DAPHNE. Alas! I cannot doubt it! SYLVIA. Good Heavens? how couldst thou be so indolent As not to follow him, and try to find him, And by thy diligence prevent the deed. Quick let us fly—let us seek every where; We yet may save him from his desperate hand. If the idea of my death so shocked him, And o'er his life spread such a horrid gloom, My safety to his mind will gild the scene. DAPHNE. I did pursue him; but he ran so swiftly, I could not overtake him;—I endeavoured To trace his flight; but my attempt was vain. Whither then wouldst thou have us go to seek him; Since where he is we cannot even conjecture? SYLVIA. Alas, but if we find him not, he'll die; Die an untimely death by his own hand. DAPHNE. Thou unrelenting woman, dost thou grieve Because thou wilt not perpetrate the deed With thy own hand; dost thou then wish to be His homicide, as thou has been his tyrant? Will not thy savage nature let thee see That it befits thee ill to murder him? But do not thus repine; for thou mayst claim, Howe'er he dies, the glory of his death: Thy fancy may be glutted with his blood; Thou givest his misfortunes their completion; The arm thou springest which inflicts the blow. SYLVIA. How thine, and how my own reproaches rack me! I'm galled to think how rigid I was to him; Yet that severity proceeded not From any pleasure in barbarity; But from the delicacy of my virtue. Now of that delicacy the excess I know, and shall repent it while I live. DAPHNE. Good Heavens! with what new language you surprize me! Dost thou begin to grow compassionate? Say, from it's hardness does thy heart relent? Are my eyes just? and dost thou really weep? Whence flow those tears? are they the tears of love? SYLVIA. No—not the tears of love; but tears of pity. DAPHNE. That's well;—thou now approachest Cupid's precincts; For pity is the harbinger of love, Sure as the lightning's flash announces thunder. CHORUS. Nay oft the subtle god, to spread his empire, Afraid lest undisguised he should alarm The virgin's tender, timid breast, puts on The unsuspected garb of innocence; And often this luxurious deity, The more effectually to work his plot, Is metamorphosed into rigid virtue, Or takes the milder dress of soft compassion. Thus he by slow, and unperceived approaches Secures a lodgment in the coldest bosom; And soon it's citadel, the heart he makes His own, and breathes into it all his flame. DAPHNE. Her grief refuses utterance to her voice. Sylvia, I now am well convinced thou lovest, But thou hast caught the tender flame too late. The god, whose power thou hast profanely spurned, With dreadful vengeance now asserts his empire. When the bee shoots it's sting, it parts with life; Like it unfortunate Amyntas dies. He, at his death, a cruel heart transfixes, Which was impenetrable while he lived, Unfeeling to a warm, yet virtuous passion. And if thy amiable spirit, loth To quit it's well known scenes for Pluto's gloom, Yet hovers round it's melancholy friends; Look down with pleasure on thy nymph's distress, Enjoy her sighs, an incense due to thee; Enjoy her plaintive words, thy well-earned vows; Enjoy the copious streaming of her tears, A fit libation to thy injured manes. In life a lover, only loved in death; Unsatisfactory, capricious fate! But since thy destiny hath been so barbarous, That thou couldst only purchase from thy mistress Her love with the surrender of thy life, The price enormous thou hast freely paid, And fallen a martyr to the purest passion, Quite sublimated from terrestrial matter. CHORUS. Dear was this price for love to him who payed it, And nought but infamy to the receiver. SYLVIA. Oh, that my love could but redeem his life! Oh that my death could him to life restore, If he in truth is dead—for still I hope. DAPHNE. Ah Sylvia! thy repentance comes too late, It's good precluded by the voice of fate; With the frail human kind a common ill; When right we cannot act, we rightly will. Thus frequently the disobedient son, The time to expiate his offences gone, Regrets his impious treatment of his sire, The parent's breath just ready to expire: He, who in vice hath wasted all his youth, Neglectful then of each important truth, Wishes, in life mature, to grow more wise; Feels virtue's charms, procrastinates, and—dies. SCENE II. Messenger, Chorus, Sylvia, Daphne. MESSENGER. Pity and horrour so possess my soul, That of my senses I'm almost bereft; Each object that I see, and hear, alarms me. CHORUS. Thy countenance, and speech express dismay; What tidings dost thou bring? MESSENGER. The doleful tidings Of poor Amyntas' death. SYLVIA. Oh knelling sound! MESSENGER. Never did shepherd tread the rural plain More graceful, and more polished than Amyntas; Of every nymph a favourite was Amyntas; Amyntas had a rich, poetick soul, And to the Muses was his genius dear. Yet in the prime of life, and bloom of virtue He's dead; and of a death how lamentable! CHORUS. Shepherd explain thyself; that his misfortune, And our own loss we may with thee deplore. SYLVIA. Alas! I dare not hear the mournful tale: Oh! my inhuman, oh! my savage heart! Now, tyrant, show thy rough, unfeeling nature. Whilst thy Amyntas lived, thou didst torment The gentlest, faithfullest, the best of shepherds, Unworthy of thy scorn, thou cold barbarian! And since his tragedy must now be told, Endure the rack this messenger prepares thee As calmly as thou didst excruciate him. Shepherd, impart thy story; 'tis to me Of more concern than haply thou supposest: I'm ready for the worst; for I deserve The most distracting truth thy tongue can utter: It is my due; and let me have it all. MESSENGER. I well believe thee; for I heard Amyntas Calling on thee just at the fatal moment; Thou wast the object of his thoughts, while thought Had yet it's mansion in his breast; his tongue Pronounced thy name ere it was mute for ever. DAPHNE. I dread the news; yet, I intreat thee, tell it. MESSENGER. Upon the hill, where oft the vacant swain Catches the feathered warblers, I was seated. There, while I watched my toils, Amyntas passed me; But how much was he from Amyntas changed! Disordered was his step, his face was pale: And from his wandering eye shot black despain. His pace was quick; I quickly followed him; And overtook him soon;—he turned, and said, Ergastus, I request a favour of thee; 'Tis that thou wouldst a little way go with me, And see me do a memorable deed: But first I must insist that thou shalt give me The sacred obligation of an oath, By which thou shalt engage to stand apart; For thou must witness bear, not interrupt me. I readily complied with his proposal; Who would have thought him bent on deed so horrid, His mind wrought up to such a height of frenzy? With all the oaths I ratified my promise That bind the faith of the religious swain. Pan, Pales, and Pomona I invoked, Priapus, and nocturnal Hecate. As soon as this solemnity was over, Up to the hill's extremity he took me, Where in an awful precipice it ends, Of barren cavities and pointed rocks. A valley terminates this precipice. We stopped upon the summit; I looked down, And started back, scared at the dreadful steep, And fearing for Amyntas's design. But he put on a countenance serene, Nay smiled; and with his smile my fear was lessened. Then thus he spoke to me; be sure, Ergastus, To tell the nymphs, and swains of our acquaintance The scene which thou shalt now behold: he then Looked down, and spoke these memorable words With all the pathos of despairing love. “Had I the ravine of a famished wolf As near me as I have this rugged steep, I'd seek to die thy death, my hapless fair one; I'd wish to have my body torn, and mangled, As was thy delicate, and beauteous frame: I grudge myself an easier death than thine. But since I cannot have my wish accomplished; Since Heaven denies the opportune attack Of a rapacious animal; this way I'll take to die, although it be too gentle. Sylvia, I follow thee, I come: Oh! Sylvia, let me Be thy companion in a better state! How richly would my death be then rewarded! Yes, Sylvia, sure thou wilt; the land of spirits, Is, doubtless, a more generous world than this, And consequently doth exalt our natures. There too a purer flame inspires the swain For unembodied nymph! thy virtue placed Beyond the reach of gross mortality, Thy virgin-fears will there be all removed; For there ethereal love alone can woo thee: Sylvia, I follow thee, I come!” He said, And down the precipice strait threw himself, While I stood torpid with severe amazement. DAPHNE. Unfortunate Amyntas! SYLVIA. Wretched Sylvia! CHORUS. Thou shouldst have stopped his rashness; but perhaps Thy oath prevented thee from interposing? MESSENGER. No; when I saw his purpose, I forgot That I was sacredly engaged; and sure, Heaven, in such cases, from an oath absolves us; I flew to save him; caught him by his girdle: The girdle snapped, too feeble to pull back His body's weight, impelled with violence. It in my hand remained; I've brought it with me. CHORUS. And did you not look down to see what followed? MESSENGER. Ah! no; with what I had already seen I was so terrified, I looked no farther: I could not look upon his mangled corse: I saw his mangled corse in my mind's eye. CHORUS. I never heard a more disastrous tale! SYLVIA. Sylvia may justly now be said to have A stony heart, since this news doth not kill me. And since the tidings of my death yet wanting Their proof, occasioned his untimely end; A sacrifice ill-suiting my disdain: 'Tis meet that his too true catastrophe, Who was my faithful, and too generous lover, Should by my voluntary death be followed. For I am overwhelmed with shame, and horrour: Already conscience is in arms against me, Chides my delay, and points me out the tomb. Grief is a cowardly, lazy, trifling thing; 'Twill be too slow an executioner; I'll have recourse to the decisive steel; Or the dear zone shall be my instrument, Which left it's hold, and could not bear to see The horrid exit of it's gentle master. It stayed behind him to revenge his fate, And give my rigour it's just retribution. Unhappy zone of more unhappy swain! Grudge not awhile to be in my possession; For I will keep thee but to vindicate The wrongs I've done to thy departed owner. 'Twas certainly my duty to have been The kind companion of his earthly state; But since profanely I've despised that duty, I go to seek him in the future world: I conquer the timidity of woman; I sacrifice my life to injured love; Perhaps that offering may propitiate Heaven, My guilt may expiate, and entitle me To join my shepherd in the shades below. CHORUS. Take comfort, Sylvia; for this accident We should ascribe to fortune, not to thee. The violence of grief that wrings thy soul Would make tears flow from the most flinty nature. SYLVIA. Shepherds, why weep you? do you weep for me? You prostitute your pity, if you do; For I had no compassion for Amyntas. For him more justly if your tears you shed, Wipe them away; they suit not the occasion; Too trivial an effect from such a cause. And thou, my Daphne, too, wipe thine away; They wound me, Daphne, and they're unavailing. And if thy Sylvia raises this emotion, I beg thou mayst suppress it to oblige me, And turn thy mind to a more worthy object. Let us perform a sadly pleasing office; Let us our shepherd's breathless, mangled limbs Redeem from the unhospitable rocks, And with a decent sepulture compose them. His grave with yew, and cypress we'll adorn, And, with more gay religion, o'er it strew The brightest, and most aromatick flowers, Invoking Heaven for his eternal rest. For nothing now but his funereal rites Detains me longer from the realms of Pluto. Let me perform this last, this only duty That I can pay his memory ere I die. And though, I'm sensible this impious hand A work so pious may contaminate, Yet well I know the tribute of this hand, However impious, will be grateful to him. His death, alas! but too completely proved How partially, with what excess he loved me! DAPHNE. Yes, Sylvia, I'll assist thee in that office, With a most amicable veneration For the remains of our departed friend; But on condition that thou thinkest not Of dying, when his obsequies are over. SYLVIA. I've hitherto lived only to myself, To gratify my supercilious temper: But the few moments I have yet remaining, Devoutly will I dedicate to him: Those marks of love I'll show Amyntas dead, Which I would never give his graceful person, When animated with it's tender soul. But a short period I assign my life; Soon after I've inhumed my lover's body, Mine by the nymphs and swains shall be interred. Amyntas' grave shall be made large enough To hold the corpse of each; we have, in life, Been, by my folly, kept too much asunder; Then let us in the tomb repose together. Pray, shepherd, show me where my lover lies. MESSENGER. Daphne will show thee: 'tis not far from hence. DAPHNE. Yes, I'll conduct thee; well I know the place. SYLVIA. Shepherds, farewell, the heavenly powers preserve you. Ye trees, ye rivulets, ye hills, adieu! Adieu, for ever to the bloom of nature! MESSENGER. Shepherds, this nymph, without our watchful care, The fate of her Amyntas soon will share; Her gesture, look, and words bespeak despair. CHORUS. How different are the powers of love, and death! This robs the bosom of it's vital breath; It takes all sense, all imagery away, And leaves the body cold, impassive clay. But that the quintessence of life inspires, And mortals with celestial rapture fires; Life without love but ill deserves it's name, To full existence love exalts the frame; The wondering mind with new ideas fills, Quickens each sense, and in each atom thrills; Creation only half produces man, And Cupid finishes what Jove began. Custom with nature death hath taught to jar, Death's harvest is the monstrous work of war; But gentler, Love, is thy prolifick reign; Of blooming children thine the sportive train; By ruin Death extends his ruthless sway; Thou givest, and he robs us of the day. Thou partest, cruel foe to happy life, The faithful husband, and the tender wife: Cupid and Hymen, long, in vain, have shed Their genial influence o'er an humble bed; Smiled on their work, and seen the virtuous pair Reap all the bliss mortality can share; When, lo, thy hand the sacred tie destroys, And puts a period to the purest joys: Cold is the breast that burned with hallowed fire, And never entertained a loose desire; For ever mute is that persuasive tongue, On which a strong, but artless rhetorick hung; Dull are the eyes, that glistened oft with speech, Which the tongue's narrow province could not reach; The blushing rose no more those cheeks will show, To which the soul oft sent a deeper glow. But while they lived, Love was their constant guard, Improved them, and augmented their reward; Virtue by kindred virtue was refined, And higher transport beamed from mind to mind: At length stepped in the inexorable foe, Envious to see such bliss reside below. Nay oft the gods forsake the seats above ('Tis said a tedium sometimes creeps on Jove) By habit with their heavenly dainties cloyed, Their nectar, and ambrosia long enjoyed, Sick of the splendour of their thrones divine, Sick of the strains of Phœbus, and the Nine; For rural groves exchange the realms of day, Pleased uncorrupted nature to survey; With unambitious mortals pleased to share Almost Heaven's happiness, without it's glare. Thus when the eye is busied to explore The rich diversity of Flora's store, Delighted her invention to pursue, The beauteous form, the fine contrasted hue, At length it finds the gay parterre too bright, The flood of glory wounds the tender sight; It turns aside from the luxurious scene, And seeks refreshment on the sober green. End of the fourth Act. ACT V. SCENE I. Elpinus, Chorus. ELPINUS. Love is not a severe, capricious god; 'Tis human blindness that will have him so; 'Tis our corruption of a generous passion. What seems obliquity, is providence; 'Tis mystery benign, only enveloped To make a scheme of happiness complete: I see he rules us with a golden law. Oh! through what rugged paths, through what dark windings, To his fair garden of Elysian bliss He leads despairing man, just when he thinks A deep abyss of misery yawns before him! Amyntas was, by Cupid's destination, From a tremendous height precipitated. Yet from that fall he meant that he should rise, That fall, which seemed his end of love and being, To gain the arduous summit of enjoyment. Happy Amyntas!—thy delights will hold Proportion to thy antecedent woes. Let thy example cheer me, and inspire me With the religion of a modest lover; And make me hope that one day, too, my fair-one, By whose delusive smiles I'm now tormented, As often flowers conceal the serpent's venom, Will from the rigour of her soul relax, And give me tender, unaffected smiles, Sent from her heart; oracular of love: Oh! 'twill be full amends for all my anguish! CHORUS. Here comes the sage Elpinus; by his talk, One would suppose Amyntas yet alive: I hear he calls him fortunate, and happy. Hard is the fate of unsuccessful lovers; So hard, they only find relief in death. Perhaps he calls his friend Amyntas happy, Concluding he excites his Sylvia's pity, Now dead, which living he could ne'er obtain. Perhaps he calls the grave love's paradise; And hopes that paradise will soon receive him. Cupid, thou art a parsimonious master, Thy zealous votaries have but poor rewards. Or rather thou art a despotick tyrant, And stiflest in the most exalted minds, The bright idea, and the throb for virtue— And is the sage Elpinus then so wretched, And so forgetful of his manly tenets, As rashly to pronounce Amyntas happy? Art thou desirous of a fate like his? ELPINUS. No, my mistaken friends—I give you joy; Amyntas is not dead, as you have heard. CHORUS. What heart-felt consolation dost thou bring us! But from the rock did he not throw himself? ELPINUS. 'Tis very true; but that precipitation, Although it had death's most tremendous aspect, Hath proved the prelude to his life, and joy. This moment he reclines on Sylvia's bosom, As tender now as she before was cruel, And with fond kisses meets her falling tears. To Sylvia's father now my steps I'm bending, The old Montanus; him I go to bring, That he may witness this impassioned scene. For, his consent obtained, the happy pair Will forthwith ratify their virtuous love: O'er them his hallowed torch will Hymen wave. CHORUS. The strongest arguments persuade this marriage: In age, in disposition, and in manners, Equal they are, and equal in their love. The good Montanus too wishes to see His life extended in his numerous race; A blooming image, usual with old men! It warms, and animates the frost of age. Therefore he surely will approve their flame. But satisfy our curiosity, I pray, Elpinus; tell us what strange fortune, Or tutelary god, preserved Amyntas, When he rushed headlong down the precipice. ELPINUS. Most willingly; hear then what I beheld. Before my cave I was; my cave you know; 'Tis in the bosom of the charming vale; And near it stands the lover's precipice, On the same side; there I with Thyrsis walked. Love was our theme; the nymph's bewitching charms, Whose power had captivated him, and me. His fortitude had thrown her influence off, And he was boasting of his liberty. But as the lover hugs his chains more fondly Than any other slave, I would insist, Not with cool reason, but with warm chimera, That though he ridiculed my servitude, It was more eligible than his freedom. Our amorous speculation soon was broken; A cry above us our attention drew; And in the instant that we heard the cry, We saw a man fall from the height; his fall Was by some herbs and bushes checked, which grew Close, and projecting from the rocky steep: But there he stopped not; onward still he rushed, And on the ground, just at our feet, he lighted. But by that intercepting prominence, His fall was gentler, and his life preserved: Yet had the broken shock it's violence; More than an hour bereft of sense he lay: We knew him straight, and for a while continued As stunned as he with wonder, and with grief. As he returned from temporary death, We from our stupefaction too recovered. Thyrsis then told me his affecting story, His ardent passion with disdain repayed. A neighbouring shepherd passed by chance that way, And we dispatched him for Alphesibeus, To whom Apollo taught the healing art, Then when to me the tuneful lyre he gave, And with fit harmony my soul inspired, To draw the full expression of it's musick. We with our best endeavours tried, meanwhile, To re-establish nature's languid functions. And while we thus were busied, we saw Sylvia, And Daphne, with her, hastily advancing. They (as they told us after) had been seeking The body of Amyntas, which they thought The vital spirit had some time deserted. Her shepherd in this plight while she beheld, The blood as yet scarce creeping to his cheeks, And slowly gaining on the lily's whiteness, Exhaling, as she thought, his tender soul, Straight love and grief with all their frenzy seized her: Never did Bacchanal show more distraction: The hills resounded with her piercing cries; She smote her bosom, and she tore her hair, And threw herself on her reviving lover. Their lovely faces too long kept asunder, Now met; she pressed her ruby lips to his. The warm impression cherished feeble nature; And grisly death, who, with his levelled dart, Had for his victim destined her Amyntas, At length, by love defeated, stalked away, (He could not bear this animating scene) And left her mistress of the doubtful field. CHORUS. I own; a strong criterion tried her love: Yet strange it is that she at once relinquished Her former coyness, and severity. ELPINUS. In common instances we may conceal The master-passion; but on great occasions, Too strongly irritated to lie still, It will break forth, and loudly tell the world What fermentation often works the soul, When it pretends to smile, and be composed. Sylvia relaxed at length from violence; And the storm ended in a shower of tears, Which on her lover's face the fair-one shed. Precious and salutary were the tears; They flowed from love; and by it's magick influence, They hastened the recovery of Amyntas. Opening his eyes, he fetched a heavy sigh; The heavy sigh, issuing from pain and languor, Was by his Sylvia's balmy mouth received; Her breath impregnated, and sent it back Fraught with the cheering seeds of life, and joy. And now his heart beats with it's usual vigour; And now his eye resumes it's former lustre. But can the most enthusiastick poet Describe their bliss in that transporting moment He to a second life was now restored; A second life, how different from the past! The past was saddened with despair, and death, But this was brightened with propitious love. And what must then have been the fair-one's feelings? She who before concluded she had caused Her swain to rush upon untimely death, Found him to perfect being now restored; And by the influence of her sympathy, Life's sweetest pleasures opening to his view; Which she with him was destined to enjoy. Ye who have been Cupid's warm votaries, Form in imagination, if you can, The inward workings of this tender scene. No—they elude imagination's power; Fancied they cannot be; much less recited. These feelings are the great originals, The incommunicable strokes of nature; Existing only where she first impressed them; They lose their life in the cold copyist's hand; Their spirit is too fine to bear transfusion. CHORUS. Amyntas, then, you say, is out of danger. ELPINUS. Out of all hazard is his life; 'tis true, His face is somewhat scratched, his body bruised: These trifles in the tide of joy are lost. Thrice happy swain! who of a virtuous maid To such extremity hast proved thy love! Thrice happy swain! thy danger now escaped, Will make thy future good more sensible; Will give thy pleasures a more vigorous tone: For pleasure, without pain, loses it's nature; And but a series yields of neutral being. Shepherds, it pleases my benevolence With joyful news to have dispelled your sorrow: You have the substance of this strange adventure; And now farewell: I go to find Montanus. Nor does this office please me less; I go To rivet pleasure in the place of woe; Proud with my influence to assist a pair, Whom Heaven hath marked with it's peculiar care; To crown with Hymen's blessings, love and truth; To make a good old man resume his youth; Make his heart feel, while he the rite surveys, The strong pulsation of it's better days; To draw it's finest language from the soul, And down his cheeks bid sacred sluices roll, Which conscious Jove will view from his abode, Of such a nature pleased to be the God. CHORUS. I'll not dispute thy providence, O Love; Perhaps Amyntas was thy constant care; And doomed by thee sublimer bliss to prove, By disappointment, anguish, and despair. But never let such pains my life annoy, Propitious sovereign of the golden bow! Give it no bitterly contrasted joy; But in a gentle tenor let it flow. To thee let men of more romantick strain, For poignant pleasure, dearly bought, apply; Calmer fruition to thy votary deign; For no knight-errant in thy realms am I. Yet, sultan-like, o'er a still, passive frame, I wish not to maintain a brutal sway; No; let bright intellect inspire my dame; And in each action dart it's heavenly ray. Let smiling liberty expand her charms; Fine sentiment should never feel controul; And let her, when her breast gay fancy warms, Indulge her own, and animate my soul. Let her sometimes repulse my growing flame; A fair-one may be opportunely coy; A victim to possess is not my aim; I would not have a blunt, and vapid joy. Nay, sometimes, that her mind may all be seen, I'd have her with me for a moment jar; And brighter thus will be the following scene; A fairer peace will crown the little war. But let not anger, rankling in her heart, Inflict the torment of her long disdain; Whatever bliss it after might impart, I'd not buy ecstacy with so much pain. Never, O Cupid! to my humble mind The dog-star's heat, or winter's horrour bring But may I ever in thy empire find The downy pleasures of the genial spring. POETICAL THOUGHTS, AND VIEWS; ON THE BANKS OF THE WEAR. ? Adversis rerum immersabilis undis. Horace. Epist. B. I. Ep. II. V. 22. TO JOHN TAYLOR, ESQ. From Calpe's rock; from famed Numidia's strand, To the bleak north of Caledonia's land, A feeling mind, though oft depressed with pains, Hath seized bright moments for poetic strains; Shut out a world, distressing, and distressed, In it's own orb, it's own elysium, blessed. And did not Bards peculiar transports know, How “could” they “suffer being here below!” To them a strange mysterious frame is given, Too fine for earth, not pure enough for heaven; Placed betwixt angels, in the middle way, And common masses of enlivened clay. The true, the ardent votaries of the muse, To mind, from matter, sublimate their views; Attached to freedom's, as to virtue's cause, Of vulgar mortals spurn the vulgar laws; Improvident for age, in rapturous youth, In love with Pope's, and Plato's beauteous truth. When she presents her charms. cold interest flies, The love of artificial splendour dies; The bold adventurer, in her service, braves, The shoals of malice, and misfortune's waves: Exulting fancy spreads her purple sail; Ambition lends her strong, and steady gale: He steers, intrepidly, to fair renown, Through the pert sneer, the supercilious frown; And as he shoots beyond Discretion's plan, All that promotes the Poet, hurts the Man. Him Plutus The god of Riches. views with unauspicious eye, Whose smiles the elements, and man defy; All capital defects his power supplies, Makes villains, virtuous, and the stupid, wise; Transmutes a sentiment, inverts a name; Hastings, with him, and Justice, are the same. But where is worth, without his magick store? The aggregate of crimes, is, to be poor. Yet, thou, my soul, till some extorted verse Withheld, through life, at length, adorns my herse; While dulness growls, and lighter fools deride, Keep thy humility, and keep thy pride;— Humility, attentive still to show What humble ignorance desires to know; That sooner would abjure it's own repose, Than give addition to the poor man's woes; Humility, whose triumph 'tis to find That years, and letters, meliorate my mind. Keep too that pride, which, conscious that the muse Opens, to poets, rich, and varied views; Views more extensive than earth, air, or sky, Impervious to the common mental eye;— That pride, which, conscious of a heart, and mind, Formed to describe, and to befriend mankind, Moves in it's natural, honourable sphere, Unchecked by power, as unappalled by fear; Sees, unconcerned, our insects of a day Presume to frolick in the muse's ray; On perseverance founds it's glorious fate, Nor meanly envies the factitious great; With strength, and lustre, forms the moral line, By time's conspiring power, secure to shine; Feels the pure bliss; enjoys the orient glow, Which gold, and scarves, and garters ne'er bestow. Oh! keep that pride, which never should despair, While nature's all-sufficient gifts we share; While God is guardian of the human kind; Supreme, omnipotent, paternal mind; But chiefly souls, fraught with ethereal flame, Born for celebrity, for deathless fame, Whom intellectual force, whom genius fills; Should speed their course, regardless of their ills; Should never, in a dark, ignoble, hour, When fancy droops, a loaded, sickly flower, Their titles to preeminence forego; For glory's warmth annihilates all woe; Gives persecuted bards a second birth, Their criticks mouldering in our mother earth; Their works long sunk, by Lethe's leaden sway, As dead, as buried, as unknown as they. Yes, keep that pride, which, from low envy free, True genius in a Jerningham can see; Admires the poet, and esteems the friend; Whose lays, whose manners, still to virtue tend; Who, in his brilliant picture of the town, Can view neglected conflicts for renown; On the back ground can view a poet thrown, While dunces, dull, and large as life, are shown; And oft, expelling fashion from his breast, With no unpleasing melancholy blessed, Revolves the world's capricious, motley tale; And sighs, that art o'er nature should prevail; That they to whom the trust of power is given, Should never act like delegates of heaven; On wings of christian love should never fly, With his acute and sympathetick eye; Genius to soothe; to call it's vigour forth; Nor croak it's faults, while he could sing it's worth. And still the Poet's glorious pride retain: Heedless of fortune, pour the tuneful strain; Along the stream of time adventurous sail; Though power affects contempt, and criticks rail. The distant laurel view with fixed regard; Of genius oft the late, but sure reward: Think, that, if envy urges all her hate, And strives to ruin our exalted fate;— Think that her malice proves us truly great. From universal laws must thou be free? That power which hates all freedom, must hate thee. Factitious great-ones ever will detest, Their betters, with innate distinctions blessed; But, haply, while they tremble on time's verge, Thy name, at least to glory shall emerge; Think that a flood of light shall crown thy day, When their poor tapers long have died away; Think, that they oft are short-lived, puny things, Mere sporting butterflies, with painted wings. Should every hostile circumstance conspire, Through life, to damp thy fancy's genial fire; Should fate repel thee to Northumbrian snows, To where a sprig of laurel never grows, Should no protector, feeling for thy muse, Give her a seat adapted to her views; Where Flora wantons, and where Zephyrs breathe; And, hence, obtain, himself, a lasting wreath; Bring great examples to thy moral thought; Think in what plight immortal Dryden wrote; Assert the path which former poets trod; Thy mind, thy climate; and thy patron, GOD! Though taste poetick from our isle is fled; And, hence, poetick force is almost dead; No Oxford, now, nor St. John, to inspire, A youthful Pope; to set his soul on fire; Imagine that thou hearest future praise; Approximate thy fame in after days: Hence, work thy verses warmly, till they shine: And if they never grow, like Pope's, divine, Still be his independent spirit thine. Thus shall my efforts for a hero's prize, Surpass the poet's, whom I idolize; Wealth, friends, and glory, fanned his generous flame; But mine, oppressive ills conspire to tame: The force, opposing Pope, was but a snake, Of common fabrick, issuing from a brake; Mine rears a hundred heads, from Lerna's lake; And if poetick strength subdues the throng, A soul Herculean must direct my song. Tossed on life's ocean, where the adventurer braves, Not fewer dangers than on Neptune's waves; Tempests, and rocks escaped, I, grateful court, The guardian angels of a sacred port; Where mild retirement beckons to her bowers; And promises her soft, yet active hours; Parnassian laurels, and Parnassian flowers. Beneath the classick Wear's romantick shades, Where Smart, and Dongworth, wooed the tuneful maids; Where, as the trees impend, the river winds, The charms of nature fire poetick minds; Where men the liberal hearts of England share, And christian candour dignifies the fair; Genius, again, may give it's powerful spring, And taste, it's lustre, to the muse's wing. Sure on this hallowed spot, Religion's seat, Where she hath, long, enjoyed a calm retreat, Envy, and malice, unrelenting foes, Dare not disturb contemplative repose;— Where christianity her golden laws, So oft proclaims—where Hinchliffe pleads her cause. Well pleased I roam through Durham's green retreats; Worthy it's banks to be the muses' seats; Thrice welcome to my numbers is the Wear; Thou to a poet must be ever dear: Thy course meandering, thy romantick shades; Thy pendent rocks, thy venerable glades; Are fit recesses for the tuneful maids: There I should boldly hope, that all the nine, Would breathe their fervour through my embryo line. In Twickenham's verse, the Thames shall ever flow, His stately oaks, his weeping willows, grow; There, still, shall Windsor tower, shall Richmond bloom, And all their gales breathe Araby's perfume. Our Akenside, great poet of the North, There, by his magick, calls luxuriance forth; Newcastle owes a splendour to his lay, Compared with which, its riches die away; He flings his sweet enchantment o'er the Tyne; Oh! might the charming Wear improve by mine! While near it's winding stream retired I rove; While distant temples aggrandize the grove; While deeper in the sacred shades I stray, Enlightened softly by the lunar ray; (Celestial orb! instructive doom to shine! Connecting human nature with divine!) All that I view, though nought my organs hear, Preaches distinctly to my fancy's ear. Methinks, as I pursue some sacred theme, The shade of Butler meets the silver gleam! I feel a stronger, purer warmth; from Heaven, To aid my sacred flame, a saint is given. Sublime analogist! thy thoughts, thy views, Demand the tribute of a grateful muse! Why will our unbelievers blindly err? Immortal life, from thee, we might infer: Could thy intuitive, expansive soul, Our earth pervading, and the starry pole, Steal from the confines of inferiour day, And sink, and die, a mass of senseless clay! No; in thy work, by close, ingenuous art, 'Tis proved, that, here, we but exist in part; There, with their own transcendent beauty, shine, The fair proportions of the scheme divine. Still more, to me to consecrate the ground, Sharp's manes floats, or seems to float around! With spirit awed, but not unmanned, I trace His open aspect; every moral grace; His well known lineaments his presence prove, Composed of dignity, and christian love; My Father's friend! my early guide to truth! The kind protector of my helpless youth! With demonstration was thy system fraught, Thy life evincing what thy precepts taught; In Durham still survives thy pious fame; Still Rothbury, with a sigh, repeats thy name! Oft might I pass, at Cocken, rural hours! Where nature wantons in Elysian bowers: Where woods, and hills, and vales, and distant spires, Arrest the mind, and wake poetick fires; Where, here, a chain of towering rocks is seen; There, flocks are browsing on the vivid green; Where Wear, through Fairy-land, his flexile course Bends, with more eloquent, emphatick force; Where some new object, still, the fancy finds; Where the long terrace by the water winds; Where artless ramparts, lofty rocks arise; Where serpentine, the clasping verdure vies With their relief; where nature's varied mien Works, in the soul, the grave, and the serene; While Finchall Abbey consecrates the scene. Here, while we feel the musick of the Wear, Far “more is meant than meets the” bounded “ear;” Here orators, and poets may be taught; Here Pope, not Spence, should have reclined, and thought: Here we may sit, and charm our cares away; Forget that passion wounds, that men betray; Image to fancy, in this hallowed space, A world uninjured by the human race. Here, too, a model of the female mind Attracts attention: simple yet refined. A virtuous fair; a tender, faithful wife, Pleased with the merit of connubial life, The splendid triumphs of her sex might claim, Of woman fond of universal fame. By nature taught spontaneously to please; And liberal art has but improved her ease. To softness feminine, engaging grace, All that heart's emanation in the face, She joins our stronger sense; our fixed resolve; Steady to act, sagacious to revolve; Prepared to meet misfortune's rudest storm, A Cato's firmness, in a woman's form. A muse, with pure, disinterested lay, Homage to rare desert is proud to pay: Oh! might the amaranth preserve my rhyme; And Ibbetson transmit to latest time! If while my mind retraces Cocken's charms, Again their imagery my fancy warms; If, on this theme, my strains auspicious flow, Watkins, to you their origin I owe; Accessible your friendship made my way To vales, where Horace would have wished to stray; Where soft retreats deserved his sportive lyre, And female virtue, all his moral fire. The pleasures of that sabbath are impressed, For ever, deeply, in a feeling breast. The sanctuary's worship o'er, we found, That still we trod on consecrated ground: The Bramin's larger temple fired the soul; And on the bosom new religion stole; The trees, the streams, the circumambient air, Were comments on your text, on every prayer. Yes, nature warrants all our holy fanes; She warrants all devotion's ardent strains. Watkins, through life, pursue your generous road; Let other Priests devour a patron's Toad; The certain ways to high preferment take; Instead of sermons, matchless pointers make; Or, at elections, murder, with his grace, All worth of heart, all modesty of face; While you exert the nobler human powers, With literature, and science, fill your hours, Or, spreading knowledge, lead ingenuous youth, Through classick fields, to salutary truth. In Durham, too, my friendship finds its parts; Gains an asylum in my Ambler's heart; Who sense, and literature, with humour blends, Humour, which makes no foes, and wounds no friends; Whom, in our early youth, his poet knew, When quick, and bright, the rapid moments flew; When festive mirth prevailed, and vigorous thought; When honest Woty sung, and Churchill wrote. Oh! London! what calamities I see, “In my mind's eye,” whene'er I think on thee! Years lost in folly, keen reflections bring; The death of friends inflicts an equal sting! Delusive Capital! where talents bloom In vigorous flower, to-day; but in the tomb, They set, for ever, with to-morrow's light, Wrapt in the darkness of eternal night! Garrick, who thrilled my soul in Drury Lane; Charmed me, at Hampton, in his Shakespear's fane; Passed his great bard's irremeable “bourn,” Whence “no” exempted “travellers return.” Johnson, and Hawkesworth, Goldsmith, too, I knew; They all, uncloyed with fame, from life withdrew: When such illustrious men resign their breath, Even London lessens, by the work of death. Delusive London! adverse to my strains! Specious, thy pleasures; but severe, thy pains! Oh! may I sing thee, in some happier page, The great Lyceum The school of Aristotle. of my tranquil age! And, Ambler, from our practice may we find That virtue fits all places to the mind; Freed from life's noise, and glare, may you, and I, Live like true men, that like them we may die: But long before the tributary tear Of friendship, and of love, bedews thy bier, May fair Hygeia The goddess of Health. to thy bosom bring All her salubrious power, on downy wing! Nor, in his daring sallies for renown, Here, will the bard expect the Church's frown; If he hath, still, been dangerously sincere, What, now, to him, is earthly hope, or fear! “He, in a Bishop, too, desert can spy;” Nor prejudice, nor flattery, taints his eye; But, in seditious times, he's proud to feel An honest ardour for our common weal; While real wolves, pretended saints, assail, With vulgar virulence, our sacred pale. Hence, in bright vision, to the muse is shown A candid glory circling Durham's Throne; Hence is she proud for Barrington to claim A place distinguished in the roll of fame; Not timorously ashamed, to bid her lays Flow in just unison with publick praise; So shall he reach, if but inspired she sings, A height sublimer than the choice of kings. You, but a few, I hope, with sullen phlegm, Who the gay lives of young Divines condemn; Who, in the church of Christ, exalted high, Ne'er view his deeds with emulation's eye; Who from fine sensibility of heart, Require the Dutchman's coarse, mechanick part; If through your acts, as mean a tenour runs, As operas, and perfumes, as hounds, and guns; My verse with temper evangelick hear; Turn, for a moment, the fastidious ear, (While in Religion's cause, my fancy flows) From slaves who lull you with their sleepy prose. Would you employ a salutary power? Survey yourselves;—your GOD;—in silent hour, Humbly look down on despicable pride; Nobly look up to our celestial Guide; Healer divine of body, and of mind; The Lord, and yet the Friend, of human kind; Whose penetration “knew what was in man;” Hence, he was lenient our defects to scan; Attentive, hence, our blooming hopes to guard; To give our merit more than it's reward: To guilt He deigned, averse from frown severe, His heavenly comfort, and his heavenly tear. Perhaps, these verses might advantage bear To some who “sit” enthroned “in Moses' chair;” If holy wealth would generously refine, Nor spurn the doctrine of a poor divine. But would you (as Ithuriel, See Paradise Lost. B. IV, L. 810. with his spear, Struck the dire toad, at Eve's invaded ear) Probe, with your searching pen, the mind's disease? The sickly frame salubrious truths displease, Howe'er adorned, from fancy's moral store; For “touch” but guilt, “no minister so sore.” But should my liberal strain, no manners mend, Our worthy prelate it should ne'er offend; In adamantine panoply, his breast, From wholesome satire feels perpetual rest; For, sure, Omniscient Heaven the life approves Of Him, whom Lansdowne hates, and Virtue loves. Maker of heaven, and earth!—of human kind! Of Universe the Parent, Source of mind! Hence, may my age expunge the faults of youth, Devoted firmly to the cause of truth! Not to those truths alone, which lead to fame; To write strong verse; to argue; to declaim; But to that truth, by which, in life, we show Thy beauteous moral government, below. That government, by whose benign controul, We keep the body subject to the soul; Beneath whose power our happiness is wrought By virtuous action, and exalted thought. May I, by temperance, live exempt from pain, And health, vivacity, and glory gain; And while the muse's pure, ethereal ray, My night illumines, and adorns my day; And while the social hour, propitious, blends A few select, and literary friends, Or, by the influence of the virtuous fair, Breathes through my verses a diviner air; Content shall soothe me, should no titled dame Pronounce me foremost in the lists of fame; Should no factitious bliss my life beguile; The splendid circle, and the courtly smile. What though my chamber seldom can admit Deep living science, or illustrious wit; Yet Plutarch visits me, and with him brings A wondrous train of Sages, Heroes, Kings; Whose vast exploits our little deeds efface; A species different from the modern race. When wintry horrours chill the drooping year, Will not the gloom an Aristides cheer? Feels not my bosom emulation's flame, With his, my form, my origin, the same? Alike of peace, and war, the generous guide, At once, the shame of Athens, and the pride! In other countries, in the worst of times, Men are, in general, banished for their crimes; His virtues drove him from his parent state, His justice doomed him to an exile's fate. Sertorius flies from Sylla's dreadful power, And deigns to actuate my sequestered hour; Again bids freedom in Iberia bloom; And colonizes, there, a second Rome; But ah! at Rome, his mother yields her breath; Long mourns the hero for maternal death; Then with new spirit is his vengeance hurled Against the ruthless tyrant of the world. See Cato animate the Grecian page; The first of mortals, in the vilest age; Yet (the fine magick such of virtue's charms) Without a weapon, ruffians he disarms; Awed by his presence; pierced by virtue's ray, The aggregated bands dissolve away. In Afric he renews the patriot's toils; A hero is the same in different soils; Anxious to save his poor, transplanted Rome; To counteract expiring freedom's doom: At length, he sheaths his unsuccessful sword; Determined, soon, to plunge it in it's lord. Feeling for others, yet with look serene, Behold him close his last, his awful scene! See how august a great man's grief appears! Cato collected; every friend in tears; Those friends (no private fears his soul annoy) His latest cares, his latest breath, employ. Unvexed with envy, let me, still behold All the delusive magick wrought by gold; It's baubles rattle, and it's tinsel shine; While nature's amphitheatre is mine. Oft, in a vernal morn, with early dawn, Let my steps brush the dew-drops from the lawn; See Sol's majestick orb, with orient ray, Rise, mount, and flame, and dart more vigorous day. The little, active lark, inhales his fire, It's note preluding nature's grateful choir; Melodious warblers carol all around; An ancient forest multiplies the sound; With stronger flush the red carnation blows; A livelier tint adorns each opening rose; With glowing colours, fragrant odours vie; Creation wafts it's incense to the sky! When the day's ardour, with it's toil is o'er, The sun descending to the western shore; When sight uninjured meets his gentle rays, “Shorne of their” fiercer “beams,” “Shorne of his beams,” is an expression of Milton. of noon-tide blaze; When with his calmer fires the mind is blessed, And sinks, in pleasing sympathy, to rest; When deeper shades dismiss the parting day; Let me the majesty of night survey. See, from the East, the placid, “peerless queen,” Emerging, bids us read the solemn scene; Hail, heavenly monitor, refulgent moon! To me still dearer than the god of noon! Higher, and higher, now behold her rise, And silver all the azure of the skies; The sweet Enthusiast says, or seems to say (She shoots an argument in every ray) Can I, oh! man, can all our system shine, And move harmonious, but by Power Divine! In the rapt soul her eloquence we feel; While silence listens to her fair appeal! Celestial apparatus! while the muse Your dread magnificence, your beauty views; How even shall candour soften my disdain Of trifles which attract the thoughtless train! Must I not villas, palaces despise, That charm, and sicken, vulgar, envious eyes! Yes, all these childish toys of tortured art, “Play round the head, but ne'er affect the heart;” A Sandby's, Mr. Sandby of Windsor-park; a Gentleman equally well known, as a masterly architect; and as a man of amiable manners, and of a friendly heart. and a Brown's ingenious plan, Direct my thoughts to terminate in man; While Phœbe, sailing in her orient car; The strong theology of every star; The foliage of the grove, of every tree, Of every flower, presents my GOD to me. A POETICAL ADDRESS TO THE SUPREME BEING. 1764. If noble thoughts poetic warmth inspire, No trifle should employ the sacred fire; Fancy should then her little flowers disdain, And pour a simple, but a manly strain. My raptured soul despises narrow views, I mount no Pegasus, invoke no Muse; I neither beg Apollo, nor the Nine To speed my verse, and live along each line: Fly hence the whole parade of classic powers, Castalian beverage, and Castalian bowers. My God! my Father! Lord of Heaven and Earth! Whose high command spoke Nature into birth; Parent of intellectual human kind, Stupendous Former of the reasoning mind; Of Newton's being the propitious cause, By whom we viewed Thee through thy wondrous laws; Whose goodness Milton on mankind bestowed, Sublime despiser of each beaten road; Whose ardent flight with pleasing awe we trace, Darting through chaos, and unmeasured space; To thee I sing!—Thy poet's numbers aid, Check him, when rash, and heat him, when afraid; Accept the pious tribute of his lays. Who burns, at once, and trembles while he prays! If by the errors of my youth distressed, If by misfortune's galling load oppressed, From tinsel, and from crouds awhile I steal, My bleeding heart with serious hours to heal; From each inferior object if I flee, And fix my soul on poetry, and thee; Be to thy servant's virtuous aim benign, Forgive his faults, and favour his design. O Thou! whose mighty mandate can restrain The whirlwind's force, the thunder of the main; Now, and at every such important time, When I would only live to Heaven, and Rhyme, Soothe, with thy kind omnipotence, to rest Each perturbation that corrodes my breast; Present fair Virtue to my longing eyes, In beauteous prospect let Elysium rise; Be mine the pictures, and be mine the love That ravished Plato in his laurel-grove. Or give me such a happy mental frame As rouzes oft the holy Bramin's flame, Who unemployed, unvexed with aught below, Stranger to vice, to folly, and to woe, In sweet retirement fixes his abode, Marks blooming Nature, and adores her GOD. Him, reverend sage, nor grief nor pain assail, Health, peace, and fragrance breathe in every gale: At eve, when Zephyr waves the stately trees, His inspiration rises with the breeze; Quick to the throne of grace his vespers fly, Mounted with Indian odours to the sky! Be all my wanderings from this moment o'er, And let me waste my fleeting life no more; Be it, henceforth, my steady care to find Health for my body, virtue for my mind; Firmly to execute the noble plan That forms the youth, and dignifies the man; Enables us each human shock to brave, To smile in age, nor shudder at the grave. When Pleasure courts me to her fatal arms With all the glitter of delusive charms; When Habit steps forth from her gaudy train, And strives to lead me captive in his chain, Let thy strong influence cheer my languid heart, Bravely to act the moral hero's part, To think how odious any deed must be Ever condemned, in Nature's course, by Thee: Before me too let Virtue be pourtrayed, In all her winning majesty arrayed; Let Memory ancient precedents compare, Examples hideous, and examples fair; Observe how Macedonia's frantic youth, Deserting all his Aristotle's truth, To passion, and excess his life resigned, The murderer of himself, and human kind! Let Brutus to my fancy next appear, Brutus, whose name commands a patriot's tear! Who in a factious, dissipated state, Aspired by goodness only to be great; Still perfect rectitude he strove to gain, Unmoved by fear, by pleasure, or by pain; And closed his conduct with a glorious doom, Victim to Virtue, Liberty, and Rome! Still warm me with thy true Religion's flame, Benevolence and it are sure the same; Let me not form instead of substance court, The idiot-actor of a holy sport; Let me detest a furious party zeal, And strive to forward universal weal: Where'er thy providence and rule extend, There let my interest, my affections blend; Let me the Good as friends and neighbours view, An honest Turk, a Christian, or a Jew. Inspire my breast with sentiments humane, And let me listen when the poor complain: Let me make all their hapless chance my own, Heave sigh for sigh, and echo groan for groan; Be mine the joy to bid the hungry live, And prop the being Thou art pleased to give. My Poetry to Thee, my God, I owe; And Thou, again, hast given my verse to flow. Then never may the talent be applied To plead for villainy, or flatter pride: Thou, and the Good be subjects of my praise; Free from corruption let my generous lays Defend the worthy, and the bad assail, Though legal tyrants hawl me to a jail. Oh! let me studiously my soul refine! Henceforth be knowledge, and be virtue mine! Undaunted let me urge the glorious aim, Let nought beneath it my attention claim, And yet thy vital spirit longer give: Let me not die till I have learnt to live! This maxim to my mind be present still, “Our happiness depends upon our will;” That no peculiar station it assumes, Is not essential to the warriour's plumes, The king's dominion, or the hermit's beads; The sure reward alone of virtuous deeds: With gold and titles will not always thrive, And dwells, perhaps, with Conway more than Clive. Oft let me from a jarring world retire, And wake Philosophy's ecstatic fire; Think on my God along the sounding shore, And listen to his power in Ocean's roar; Reflect how great the Lord of all things reigns, Who heaves the billows, and their force restrains. Oft through the fragrant meadow let me rove, And catch a lecture in the tuneful grove: For Thou inspirest Philomela's note, And pourest music from the linnet's throat; From Thee the thrush hath his melodious trill; Thine are the soothings of the gentle rill; Stronger by Thee the rapid river flows, By Thee the oak magnificently grows: Thy energy the heavenly host pervades, Not merely vigorous in our tranquil shades; Thou art not stinted to this little ball, Thy presence fills, connects, and governs all. Yet let me frequently thy goodness trace, And power amazing in the human race; Worship with gratitude, the bounteous hand That formed the social, adamantine band; That varying geniuses on man bestowed, As vegetation lives in many a mode: As here a tulip, there a lily blows, Here too a Shakespeare, there a Locke arose; Harmonious differences compose the whole, Bright emblems of the Universal Soul! Nor may I sourly scruple to engage In customs, and amusements of the age, So long as neither my attention draw From Thee, GREAT GODHEAD, and Thy sacred law! Yes, let me ever study to endear Myself to man (for man's Thy image here) Whilst I discharge to Virtue what I owe, Nor dignity, by cringing, feels a blow. What boots, alas! a stupid Roman spell, The cruel sackcloth, and the moss-grown cell? Can such vain gew-gaws our Creator please? No,—there's no purity, no sense in these: And though the passion may not be avowed, Becket, the saint, is Becket, still, the proud. And if a noble-minded friend I find, Mild to my failings, to my virtues kind; Who ever holds my smiling fortune dear, And o'er my misery drops a tender tear; Oh! let my breast with equal transport burn, Ready such tribute always to return; From gratitude not meanly to be scared, Though gibbets, wheels, and faggots were prepared. Assist me, ever, Nature's course to steer, My body healthful, and my conscience clear; Discharging all my duties here below, All that to others, and myself I owe: These points alone the real owners bless, More makes none happy, happy none with less! Thus, when at last, my strenuous race I've run, No business of importance left undone; When strength no more it's force elastic lends, And flagging life to it's conclusion tends; Let not my age contempt by bustling meet, But may I wisely seek some calm retreat; For action, and for books, alike unfit, Down to sweet recollection let me sit; Hope humbly for compassion at Thy throne, And glide serenely to a world unknown! A CONFERENCE BETWIXT APOLLO AND HIS DISCIPLE. La Nature fait des heureux, malgre la Fortune; la Fortune n'en fait jamais malgre la Nature. Essais de Trublet, vol. iii. p. 270, Paris Edit. TRANSLATED. Nature makes some men happy in spite of Fortune; but none were ever made happy by Fortune in spite of Nature. TO MR. CHURCHILL. 1764. 'Twas on a sweet autumnal eve, Just when their tea the ladies leave; And to the Berwick-Mall repair, Not for the men—but for the air; When I employed the silent hour To rouse imagination's power, Fixed only to a Poet's duty, Unmoved by scandal or by A married man ought not to talk in general terms of being moved with beauty. He should not be moved with any fine sight in the world. He should be a stone. Dr. De Bois's Ethics, Vol. II. Page 357. beauty; Regardless of the mental pains, That oft have checked my youthful strains; Pains in my lot so very rife, They quite obscure my scene of life. Down was I seated at the table, To think as fast as I was able: The servants of the tuneful trade, Pen, ink, and paper were displayed. Ideas now began to teem, And usher in the magic dream; I really thought (forgive the strain, Our sect, you know, will still be vain) For me the nine inspiring maids Had left their Heliconian shades. But by a singular event The spell asunder soon was rent; Away the flowery vision flew, And a new scene my notice drew For a gale visited my door, I ne'er heard one so soft before; And with it brought a rich perfume, A rabian odours filled my room: This gale, you'll find, conveyed a God From Jupiter's divine abode; The fragrant scent that with it came, Forth issued from his heavenly frame. Next the melodious God Apollo, Whose laws I much delight to follow, Entered my cell with noble gait, Yet no austerity of state; I knew him by his hair unshorn, His visage brighter than the morn; His long and flowing flaxen hair Waved gently to each breath of air; His cheeks were flushed with ardent youth, His eyes spoke poetry and truth; Mine scarce could bear to meet the ray, Effulgent with celestial day. A laurel-wreath, with flowers intwined, Trust me, most charmingly designed, The laurel, and the flowers unfading, To form the crown each grace was aiding, On his fair brow my Patron wore, In his right hand a lyre he bore. I rose astonished from my seat, With due respect the god to meet; Kneeling I paid my adoration, For even to gods I hate prostration; And when I bow the pliant knee, The homage is sincere from me: The knee that ne'er, with servile fate, Shall trembling on a vizier wait, Though his benign administration Thaws with it's beams a frosty nation. Stockdale, my friend, he said, arise: The generous beings of the skies Oft use their influence here below To quell a hapless mortal's woe; And deem themselves as truly great In condescension, as in state. Nay even the Universal Mind, Lord of divine, and human kind, Thinks that his Majesty's no less, When earthly man he deigns to bless, Than when he rends the pole asunder, And shakes creation with his thunder. For me to make no idle splutter, Nor put your spirits in a flutter; I've hither come to give you ease, Not to perplex you, but to please; To show the method, which, employed, By it your life may be enjoyed, And you enabled to rehearse, In easy fortune, easy verse. And now, that my benign intention To you may meet with no prevention, But may completely be applied, Let us lay needless form aside, Like easy friends, each take a seat, That I may say what I think meet. And as the jovial god of wine Can human nature make divine, Open the sluices of the soul, And bid them flow without controul; Bring us the bottle and the glass, And smoothly let the minutes pass: Suppose my godship quite away, And fancy you're in chat with Mr. John Grey, an attorney, at Berwick. He fell from his horse, in a severely frosty night, and was starved to death. Grey, With whom no minutes you can waste, For all his sentiments are taste; Who owes to me, and doctor Cullen That he's not shrouded in his woollen. Immediately he took a chair, Easy, alert, and debonair; And seeming not to see my pother, He kindly reached his bard another. I could not speak a word with ease; But at length hesitated these: Since thou, harmonious, healing power, Deignest with me to spend an hour, We have some claret from Bourdeaux; 'Twill make our thoughts with ardour flow. I drew the cork; we drank some glasses To worthy men, and pretty lasses; And as I now began to feel The subtle balsam sweetly steal, Quite undismayed. I grew inclined To speak the movements of my mind. And without studied preparation, I thus described my situation; And stifling laudable ambition, Preferred the following odd petition. Can that good deity who shares In my uncommon load of cares; Who heavenly honours can forego, To sympathize with mortal woe, Receive offence, if I explain My troubles in a simple strain; How hard they are, presume to tell him, And what I think alone can quell 'em? Phœbus assured me he would hear My story with propitious ear; And I, encouraged by the proffer, Proceeded thus my thoughts to offer. To sing the beauties of a grove, The joys, and agonies of love; In striking harmony of numbers To picture Virtue's peaceful slumbers, The phantoms that the knave infest, And keep him all the night from rest; The glory of a bero's death, Who for his country yields his breath: To bid Pratt live to future ages, Embalmed in monumental pages, Who made a patriotic stand To reinstate a sinking land; Nobly joined liberty, and law, Disdaining ministerial awe; Ye gods make this my destination, A sweet, but dangerous occupation. You know, the poet lives all o'er, Strongly he feels at every pore; And while the circumspective things, That never soar on fancy's wings, In whom we ne'er see thought unfold, Are scarcely capable to hold One meagre image at a time, That image unbecoming rhyme, A scandal to poetic feet, Some stupid animal conceit; Ideas in a crouding train Press the fine texture of his brain: For him a thousand wait at once, And but one trifle for the dunce: Quick to his pericranium fleo Objects in throngs, of each degree, The mean, the beautiful, the great, The swain's content, the farce of state; There the whole world admittance gains, It's few delights, it's many pains. Thou knowest, too, that since my birth, I've barely crawled upon this earth, Have met with every opposition To intellectual nutrition; Each load that might a genius smother, Or from myself, or from another: Now, haply, by my own neglect, Or a more culpable defect, Into a sea of trouble hurled, Now by the rigour of the world. I lost my father when at college, A blow that lopt my tree of knowledge My father was that work divine, That Pope allows so bright to shine An honest man's the noblest work of God. ESSAY ON MAN.He was a truly honest man, A hero on a virtuous plan; Far greater, in my mind, than Tully, Or Alexander, Greece's bully. Pardon, I pray, my grateful spirit, Digressive on paternal merit, And let me now stick to my point, Nor put my story out of joint. Since the departure of my sire, My portion of poetic fire, As I have ever been distressed, Was almost to this hour depressed: A stranger oft to balmy health, And always to the charms of wealth, Which causeth suddenly to rise Elysian scenes before your eyes; No wants to check the muse's wing, And make the poet faintly sing; No shyness from his lordship's scorn, No frown imperious to be borne: Both lavish nature, and mankind For him seem eager, joys to find: The pleasures of the festal board Fresh vigour to his soul afford; The tributary garden greets His senses with a thousand sweets; Soft sycophants perfume his lays, Even human tigers grumble praise. Balked I have been by many a friend, On whom I thought I might depend; Cheated by rogues, o'erlooked by fools, Who never judge by generous rules; When first they see one, still express Their value of him from his dress; And shrewdly deem the man most wise, Whose purse is of the largest size. Such hitherto has been my fate, Such is it at the present date. The man for poetry designed, In body delicate, and mind, Ill brooks oppression's heavy curse, Grows careless of himself, or worse; In others this distress I see, And 'tis exemplified in me. Therefore this humble boon I crave, Which may thy son from ruin save. Oh! rid me of the rhyming vein, To one more happy give the strain, Who shall not pass his cloudless days In errour's and misfortune's maze. Then lucky I, transformed to stone, In flesh, and spirit, callous grown, Shall have no more those high sensations, That work us into such vexations: Hourly I'll feel the drowsy clog, And like a pack-horse on I'll jog, Through life's rough journey calmly trudge, Nor steady perseverance grudge. And though my taste shall be no more, Perhaps on books I still shall pore, And hours of solitude amuse With partial dictionary views; Like many of my reverend betters, Ne'er study aught but words and letters. Thus, when I've long, and much applied, Bloated with literary pride, Bristled with Latin and with Greek, The public notice I may seek; A Warburton I may commence, Mistaking memory for sense; Of poets give false explanations, And dream about divine legations; Inhale the incense of a Pope, And then conclude that I may cope With all the lords in critic rules, I lately read a note in Emilius; and a part of it reminded me of my Right Reverend Father, the bishop of Glocester. The whole note is worth giving my reader, as it is written by the delicate and sublime Roussean. La plûpart des savans le sont à la maniere des enfans. La vaste erudition resulte moins d'une multitude d'idées que d'une multitude d'images. Les dates, les noms propres, les lieux, tous les objets isolé, ou denués d'idées se retiennent uniquement par la mémoire des signes, et rarement se rapellet-on quelqu'une des ces choses, sans voir en même-temps le recto, ou le verso de la page où on l'a lue, ou la figure sous laquelle on la vit la premiere fois. Telle étoit à peu prés la science à la mode les siècles derniers; celle de notre siècle est autre chose. On n' étudie plus, on n' observe plus, on rêve, et l' on nous donne gravement pour de la philosophie les rêves de quelques manvaises nuits. On me dira que je rêve aussi; j' en conviens; mais ce que les autres n'ont garde de faire, je donne mes rêves pour des rêves, laissant chercher au lecteur s'ils ont quelque chose d' utile aux gens éveillés. —Emile, Tom. 1. P. 132, 133. Edit. Selon la Copie de Paris. “The knowledge of most learned men resembles that of children. Immense erudition is not so much the result of many ideas, as of many images. Dates, proper names, places, all those barren objects that afford no ideas, are merely retained by the memory of signs: and we seldom recollect any one of these things, without remembering at the same time, the side of the leaf in which we read it, or the shape in which it first presented itself to our eyes. Such, almost was the fashionable knowledge of the last centuries: The prevailing turn of this age is very different. We study no more; we make no more observations: we are now a set of dreamers; and we gravely publish the dreams of a few restless nights, as accurate philosophy.—Perhaps I may be told that I dream too: With all my heart; but I give my dreams for dreams, which is not the practice of other visionaries; leaving the reader to examine whether they contain any thing that may be of sure to people awake.” Now it appears to me that the Bishop hath fallen into both the absurdities of these two literary periods. He seems to be a compound of labour, and chimera.That governed all the ancient schools. What matter though I'm in a vision, And the mere subject of derision? By my own verdict if I'm blest, I'll not be anxious for the rest. Then in dame Prudence's affairs, I shall employ my utmost cares; Strive to mount higher in the church; And leave young deacons in the lurch; Drink with some powerful country squire, Swear all he says is attic fire, Bow myself double at his door, Commend his pointer, and his whore. Thus if I supple prove, and mean, Perchance I yet may be a dean; Young pulpit-orators descry With envious and malignant eye; Their merit constantly keep down With deeds unjust, and haughty frown; Be plotting still some cruel work, Ride my cathedral like a Turk, And slumber in my crimson-stall, The heaviest blockhead of them all. Perhaps you'll fancy by my stile That I'm but jesting all this while. Then, if you please, we'll set aside The commentaries I've applied, As so much flourishing discourse; Yet pardon me if I inforce My scheme with recapitulation, And for it beg your approbation; Take from me all in verse that flows, And sink me down to simple prose; I find it is not for my good; Make me a dunce, oh! make me wood! In truth I beg the dissolution Of my harmonious constitution. Thus my petition preferred, Which with a smile Apollo heard; And suffered me not long to wait For the decision of my fate: For after I had closed my speech, Thus did the god begin to preach. Alas! I pity human kind, To their true interest often blind! Should I to your desire agree, Another week you would not see: Life would be such a grievous load, I fear you'd take the shortest road To rest among the peaceful dead, And cut yourself the vital thread. For let us now suppose away The influence of poetic ray, The glorious, the divine delights, That issue from your present flights, That energetic mental frame, That higher works up Friendship's flame, A thousand vigorous joys bestows, Which ne'er in vulgar bosoms rose— Your being, then, would be so scant, Of what you were you'd find such want, That your poor famished, wretched soul, Like those cooped in Calcutta's hole, Would look on death with longing eyes, The last, the dearest earthly prize! Take courage then, and rest assured Your bliss henceforth may be secured; The greatest goods that mortals gain, Must bear proportionable pain: Those whom the gods with parts inspire, Are often blasted with their fire; It hurries them a headlong course, Like an unmanageable horse; And feller than their bitterest foe, Plunges them in a gulph of woe, More perfect were the poet formed, His mind by no rude passion stormed, In nature's scale he'd quit his place, And vie with our immortal race. Did his soul uniformly flow, Like souls less racked, because more low; Were progress upon progress gained, By no repelling check restrained; Had not externals often power To seize him in a careless hour, His sensibility of frame Now to convulse, and now inflame, Extinguishing awhile his views Of steadiness, and of the muse, Producing many a sad event, His punishment by nature meant; Did not his sentimental heart With keen compunction often smart— In short, could he but in his way, The matchless fortitude display Of an unchangeable Lord-Mayor, Who haggling first with paltry ware, Is never by one feeling struck, But that of prosperous, or bad luck; And caring not a single pin Whether our warriours lose, or win, Provided his affairs but tally In his own shop, and in the alley, A train of thievish commerce past, Obtains the Mansion House at last, That big, smoaked, dirty, stupid pile, Exactly in his worship's stile— If thus unshaken were his aim, Who could set limits to his flame? Earth, sea, and air, and skies he'd find Too little for his boundless mind; He'd grasp the most remote domains, And hold a captive world in chains. Then, as he's formed to hate and scorn All that are base, and sordid born, Stakes would impale the wretch that cozens, And purse proud asses hang by dozens. But here his vigour would not stay, He'd search an unfrequented way; By some acute invention try To wing his journey to the sky, Quaff nectar in the realms above, And pluck the very beard of Jove. But, pray, to my advice attend (Apollo's every Poet's friend) Throw on your mind the moral rein, It's effervescences restrain; Expend each ardent challition In reading, or in composition; And joys unmixed you then shall find, Loved by the Gods, and by Mankind. Your faults are viewed with generous eyes By the good people of the skies, Who candour never can forego, Like narrow mortals here below; See the soul's innermost recess, Know fully what your acts express; And hence give each it's proper name, Nor idly sport away your fame. Dully through life all cannot steal, A few must exquisitely feel; And by strong impulses attacked, By tyranny of passion racked, The government of reason lost, In jeopardies they're often tost. But all their youthful sallies o'er, And unexperienced now no more, They cease to merit farther blame, And virtue is their constant aim. To have your own vote on your side, (A rule you lately misapplied) Makes rectitude more sweet, and strong; But stabs it when you're in the wrong. Then lest I throw my pains away, And vainly quit the realms of day, An object let me represent, That sure will win you to content. How highly riches are esteemed! Emblem of every good they're deemed! And while the mind neglected lies, The treasure of the good and wise, No culture on that part bestowed, That lifts a man into a God; For shining ore the sailor braves The foaming madness of the waves; Familiar ploughs the Northern Seas, Content in Greenland's ice to freeze, Now shivering on a Polar strand, Now gasping in a Southern land. For this the restless merchant toils And eager heaps commercial spoils, Every humane emotion lost In apathy of mental frost! And deaf to pity's gentler sounds, Hears nought but shillings, pence, and pounds. Now let me introduce a man, Formed but on Nature's common plan, Not of that intellectual force That spurs us to a generous course, Of this same idol, wealth, possessed, And, doubtless, consequently blessed: A gilded circle every day Their worship at his levee pay, Where, sweetening each respectful word, He hears the music of—“My Lord;” And wheresoever he appears, Nought rough offends his eyes, or ears; He walks through an elysian maze Of admiration, and of praise. As far as matter too can go, Of happiness how fair a show! A palace in some noble square, Another for the rural air; A coach of the superbest kind, With gaudy scoundrels packed behind; Turtle, and ortolans, and plate; All the companions of the great, With him take up their kind abode, All grandeur's complicated load. Now, ere you probe his lordship's case, If you but view it's outward face, You'll think him destined at his birth, High Heaven's vicegerent here on earth. But mere externals have not power To bless you with one happy hour; Felicity you'll ever find, Springs from the vigour of the mind: Unless it holds a noble tone, Human enjoyment is unknown: The mind, my friend, the mind's the man, And just according to it's plan, Affluence may give you no delight, But you may sicken at the sight; Or in a noisome dungeon thrown, Meagre your food, your bed of stone, Pleasures, with bright and balmy wings, May visit you, that fly from kings. Superiour beings can, with ease, Give objects any form they please, And joy from circumstances gain, Where weaker souls would die of pain. Don't you perceive, whene'er I shroud My glories in a heavy cloud, How blank even Summer's charms appear, How all is desolate, and drear? But when my unobstructsd blaze Returns it's animating rays, Whate'er is offered to your sight, Takes new creation from the light; Bright Flora with a livelier die Engages the spectator's eye; More verdant leaves the trees adorn, A whiter blossom decks the thorn; The birds rejoice on every spray, And all is rapture, all is day! 'Tis thus the workings of the soul It's present images controul: Mark a man's inward sun: from him The world is luminous, or dim; To an inferiour, vulgar view, Existence wears a dusky due; But where the powers of genius thrive, All is resplendent, all alive. But let me not forget my peer; Grant his health good, and conscience clear; Yet, on a trivial search, you'll find, In bliss you leave him far behind. Does he those fine perceptions know Felt by a chosen few below? When setting Sol's about to lave His tresses in the western wave, And taste the joys of Thetis' bed, The skirts of ether streaked with red; When not a murmur waves the woods, When not a murmur moves the floods; Can he in sweet recesses muse, Absorbed in philosophic views? Can he such imagery conceive As makes the struggling bosom heave, Causeth, while thought pervades the sky, The flushing cheek, the humid eye; And bids, at each momentous turn, The frame to shiver, and to burn? When Neptune now forgets to roar, The sea unruffled, hushed the shore; Along the margin can he stray, While meditation marks his way; And raise devotion's holy strain, His fancy shooting o'er the main? Tell me, to books if he applies With eager, and creative eyes; Can he, perusing Plato's page, Catch all the ardour of the sage? Are his whole faculties on fire, When Horace wakes the sounding lyre? Can he, when Livy's work he reads, Groan where the chaste Lucretia bleeds; Shudder at Rome's expiring state, And glow, and pant for Cato's fate; Dissolve in Thomson's melting flow, And weep, and tremble with Rousseau? But now prolix my lecture grows, I'll therefore bring it to a close. Let Patience, and let Prudence guide Your free-born spirit's generous tide: That a young poet is a curate Is hard, but manfully endure it; 'Tis not, I hope, your fated sphere To be through life imprisoned here: Perhaps you'll yet see halcyon-days, Brightened with profit and with praise. Let Folly, and Revenge exclaim, They cannot bar your path to fame; Despise each puny, snarling elf, And only regulate yourself. To heaven again I steer my way; Nothing remains for me to say; The blundering scheme proposed by you, All my intended counsel drew. The god arose, and pressed my hand; I knelt—he let me understand, That when he went, I should not follow, Nor as with men deal with Apollo. Then after him he shut the door; I neither saw, nor heard him more. Immediately fresh courage filled My heart, through every nerve it thrilled, And I resolved to take the route The deity had pointed out; Shake off the languor of my soul, And dauntless press to Merit's goal. Thou mighty critic, whose whole figure Fully denotes thy judgment's vigour; Through depth of penetration grave, An enterprizer try to save; Blast not with cruel breath the bays, Just sprouting in his youthful days; Insist to Berwick's corporation, The piece deserves not reprobation; For they and all that shall peruse This product of my artless muse, Put faith implicit in thy laws, Thy condemnation, or applause. Oh! let not then thy sanction lag, Move thy wise head awhile zig-zag; Thy candid sentence let me gain, And rank me in the tuneful train. Some criticisms for me write, To rescue me from hostile spite; Mark in these verses every grace, The unities of time, and place: That while some poets, false, and mean, Their want of native strength to screen, Are forced to borrow help from lies, Those low devices I despise; That here I elegantly tell, And faithfully, what once befel To me, who in a tête à tête With Phœbus canvassed all my fate, And offer to my reader's view At once the beautiful, and true. MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. AN ELEGY ON THE DEATH OF DR. JOHNSON'S FAVORITE CAT. 1764. Let not the honest muse disdain For Hodge to wake the plaintive strain. Shall poets prostitute their lays In offering venal statesmen praise; By them shall flowers Parnassian bloom Around the tyrant's gaudy tomb; And shall not Hodge's memory claim Of innocence the candid fame; Shall not his worth a poem fill, Who never thought, nor uttered ill; Who, by his master, when caressed, Warmly his gratitude expressed; And never failed his thanks to purr Whene'er he stroaked his sable furr? The general conduct if we trace Of our articulating race, Hodge's example we shall find A keen reproof to human kind. He lived in town, yet ne'er got drunk, Nor spent one farthing on a punk; He never filched a single groat, Nor bilked a taylor of a coat; His garb when first he drew his breath, His dress through life, his shroud in death. Of human speech to have the power, To move on two legs, not on four; To view with unobstructed eye The verdant field, the azure sky Favoured by luxury, to wear The velvet down, the golden glare— If honour from these gifts we claim, Chartres had too severe a fame. But wouldst thou, son of Adam, learn Praise from thy noblest powers to earn; Dost thou, with generous pride, aspire Thy nature's glory to acquire? Then in thy life exert the man, With moral deeds adorn the span; Let virtue in thy bosom lodge; Or wish thou hadst been born a Hodge. AN ODE TO A RIVULET; The Ode is supposed to be written by Diogenes the Philosopher. Translated, from the Spanish of Fajardo. Nymph of this fount, accept my lays; Nor spurn sincere, and virtuous praise. Well may the influence of thy stream Excite the poet's hallowed theme; For as thy waters flow, they bring Fresh health, and vigour to the spring. Down the romantick slope they glide, Their parent-mountain's grace, and pride. The feathered songsters of the tree Catch rural melody from thee; While the responsive hill, and dale, Return the soothing, amorous tale. The rose, and jasmine, by thy aid, With richer sweets perfume the shade; And Zephyr with more liberal hand Diffuses fragrance o'er the land. When fair Aurora's gentle ray Gilds with it's light the new-born day, Her beauty, by the heavenly maid, In thy clear mirrour is surveyed; The pleasing sight her bosom warms, Her face is flushed with brighter charms. Oh! emblem of my favourite plan, Example strong to wayward man; In thee his contrast I descry, And view thee with a moral eye! Thy varied beauties joys dispense Not merely to external sense; Sublimer pleasures they impart, Inform the head, and please the heart. No wild excess deforms thy course, No inundation, no rude force: Though widely thy meanders wind, They leave no trace of ill behind; They pleasure, and convenience blend, The good of human kind their end; Their limpid moisture cheers the plain, Their murmuring musick lulls the swain; Through flowery labyrinths they stray, Yet without error hold their way. Thy faithful bosom I admire, And feel for truth a sacred fire. Nought foul thy candid bosom holds, Hence, all it's objects it unfolds: I see it, it's contents declare; Each pebble may be counted there. There are the mimic branches seen, The glowing flower, the velvet-green; Thy chrystal, true to nature's laws, Gives back each image which it draws. Bright pattern of the golden age; Descriptive lecture of the sage; May I retain thee in my mind, And use the document I find! Oft may I quit the city's noise, It's ruthless wiles, it's guilty joys; The dangerous haunts of mortals flee, And dwell with innocence, and thee! ON SEEING MR. GARRICK IN DON JOHN, AND HIS AGE IN THE PUBLIC PAPERS. Nature her sons of genius rare, Those matchless men we style divine, Sometimes protects with partial care, And long they live, and long they shine. Last night confirmed I saw this truth, When England's Roscius played Don John, With all the activity of youth, With all the fire of twenty-one. Yet time with rigour turns his glass And men and empires are no more; Garrick by him is doomed to pass The bourne his Shakespeare passed before. Then let the generous youth, too warm To read the moral system's page, Whom Shakespeare's nobler ethics charm, And all the magic of the stage;— Yet knows not our first actor's power— Let him lay hold on fleeting time; A transient privilege is ours; We yet see Garrick in his prime. Capricious man! we oft neglect The good we can with ease acquire, Too late our folly recollect, And sigh, and pine with vain desire. Fancy our judgment still misleads— The hero must resign his breath Before we justly prize his deeds; His fame is ratified by death. The poet's bays are in full bloom, When he no more enjoys the light; Nought like the verdict of his tomb, Proves how divinely he could write. I, too, adopt, like other men, All this extravagance of thought: What would I give to touch a pen, With which my favourite Dryden wrote! How strongly such attractions draw! Tully through brambles urged his way, To visit, with religious awe, The grave where Archimedes lay. Thus, in that venerable fane, Where monarchs, heroes, bards repose, When the strong monumental strain Thy talents, Garrick, faintly shows;— Should One, who has thy friendship, live With streaming eye the verse to see, To him thy shade a wreath would give, Thy glory would reflect on me. And envy's lyes I'd then defeat; The poet's monument I'd raise; I'd sing thy virtues, and complete The epitaph's deficient praise; Thy zeal for every liberal art, To misery's tale thy listening ear— I'd paint thee, through life's arduous part, As great in Garrick as in Lear. PROLOGUE, For the School for Wives. Harriet, with all the life of gay sixteen, A friend to irony, a foe to spleen; A sly inspector into modern life, And therefore wishing to commence a wife, My fancy thought it overheard, to-day, Thus to her sister criticize our play. “What can this antiquated poet mean, A stranger sure to life's important scene? Some dull Welsh hermit of the reverend gown; He must be unacquainted with the town. Once by this piece it's author will not dine: It ne'er will turn the parson's ale to wine. “The pedant opens a new School for Wives; Why, marriage is the study of our lives. Instinctive soon unfolds the favorite thought; The principles of genius are self-taught. We plot, we find, even at the boarding-school, The way to win him, and the way to rule. Mixed with the world we learn to top our parts: And soon we're Graduates, Mistresses of Arts. With rapid progress the true ton we seize, And at Cornellys' take our high degrees. Vauxhall, the Park, where Venus with her doves, Sailing in æther, delegates her loves, These are the female academic groves. In short, down pleasure's stream we safely steer; What can we profit by this mountaineer?” Such are the hasty sentiments of youth, Ever impatient of a search for truth. You we request, ere you condemn, to hear; He who would mend your heart, deserves your ear. One word which Harriet spoke, I own, was true; A school our author opens somewhat new. Something he'd alter in your education, Something, which hurting you, must hurt a nation. Tutored by him, you'll quit the selfish rules, Framed to subdue, and govern, dupes, and fools: Oft by those rules poor empire you maintain, And oft lose husbands you should strive to gain; You lose the wise, the generous, and the brave; And what fair Briton would command a Slave? Ingenuous natures wish you to reclaim? By placid virtue you'll insure your aim: Virtue, serene, and social, and refined, Virtue, that opens, while she guards, the mind; That gilds with bliss the matrimonial hours, And decks her laurel with the brightest flowers; That feels it still her province to be gay, And makes mankind enamoured of her sway. “Ye married fair,” deign to attend our school; And without usurpation you shall rule; Deign from our model to adopt your part, And soon you'll fix the husband's vagrant heart; Soon will he cease mean objects to pursue, In conscience wretched till he lives to you: Your charms will reformation's pain beguile, And vice receive a stab from every smile. London, Nov. 20, 1773. To ? The Lady who is the principal object in the following poem, I yet highly esteem for her most respectable virtues, and admire for her elegant taste. Sept. 20th, 1777. You saw, my friend, in Wickham's wood, My rural tribute to the nine; For there, you say, uninjured stood Maria's name prefixed to mine. That bold inscription, in your grove, I cut, with too aspiring flame; (How warm imaginations rove!) I though it poetry, and fame. Her friendship, carved in rustic style, I thought excelled elaborate lays; I thought her still approving smile Would crown me with immortal praise. But my sad history's present page Brings your old prophet to my view; And sure, an oracle more sage Dodona's forest never knew. For, in your venerable shade, As I my rude memorial wrought, Impelled to tasks which ne'er upbraid, The wood a hoary peasant sought. The solemn pedants of the schools May boast their systematic strain; But nature's more authentic rules, And sense, and truth inspire the swain. The patriarch of the peaceful vale Approached, my characters to see; To hear the poet's favorite tale Explain the letters on the tree. His words with moral strength were fraught; I well remember all he spoke; I almost thought him, while he taught, The Druid of some aged oak. “Short bounds determine (said the sage) The joys, the cares, the toils of man; His works are transient, like his age, His labours, and his life, a span. “Still trifles agitate his breast, Delusive meteors of the day; And some are, in their birth, suppressed; And some, in thinking, die away. “Objects, whose death is less in haste, To calm reflexion are not late; For worne by time's perpetual waste, They yield to all-subduing fate. “And say, what theme employs thy mind; What occupies the sculptor here? A theme, perhaps, which he will find Worse than indifferent in a year. “Some pupil fair of London's art, Where polished falsehood holds her reign? Or warms a rural nymph thy heart, Some ruddy virgin of the plain? “Or some protectress of renown, Some guardian of the muse's flame; Whose sovereign taste directs the town, And slakes ambition's thirst with fame? “Rash man, you court a constant strife With numerous woes; of verse beware; I've heard, and read the poet's life; His toil is, thought; his prize is, air. “Though now her friendship you enjoy, And on her eulogies repose, Envy that friendship may destroy; For merit brings a host of foes. “Politeness may have formed your friend, Politeness in the bright extreme; On which the wretches who depend, For truth mistake a golden dream. “Charms to the person, to the face It gives; but withers Virtue's bloom; It's varnish rots her nobler grace; It is the Scripture's whited tomb. “'Tis branded by the moral pen; Opinion, still, the dastard fears; 'Tis meanly all things to all men; It never is what it appears. “But should your patroness withstand Each barbarous witling of the age, The dull, and the malicious band, That constant war with genius wage; “In affluence give your strains to flow, And bid with Pope's their spirit vie; On one plain truth your thoughts bestow;— Yourself, your friend, your verse, must die. “All the great scenes that bards display, All their strong pictures of mankind, By time's impression will decay, Like this inscription on the rind. “For time's relentless hand, these lines Will first distort, and then erase; Resistless hand! that undermines The pyramid's enormous base. “Then let the fit, the good, the true, Be all thy work, and all thy care; Through life, their sacred path pursue, Nor substance quit for tinsel glare. “Give reason her divine controul; And to be great, be truly wise; Let prospects animate thy soul, Sublime, and lasting, as the skies.” To me these words, in vain addressed, Produced but momentary awe; As wayward Christians are impressed, In hearing their affecting law. But since, I've longer felt their force; For where persuasion's current fails, Adversity's alarming course, Her stronger torrent oft prevails. How to the swain Maria's praise Flowed from the poet's lavish tongue, Shall not employ these temperate lays; Nor on my accents how he hung. The picture, which my fancy drew I wish to recollect no more; It brings a groupe of woes to view; It wounds the breast it soothed before. Yet her neglect I'll errour deem; For had she all my nature known; Surveyed the springs of my esteem, It's honest rise, it's generous tone; My fame she then would ne'er have left To envious enemies a prey; Then, of her influence ne'er bereft, The muse had triumphed in her sway. Nay, could she know, with what regret, My verse, half-praise, half-censure, flows, Her candour soon would pay the debt, The noble debt that justice owes. Friendship with poetry she'd prize, Rejoin their pure, congenial flames; And thus again she'd authorize The rural union of our names. Then happy might her poet live, As long as he enjoyed his breath; And what can future chances give; What are our names beyond our death? What then imports it, that they're stormed By poisoned shafts against them hurled? Imports it aught, that they're deformed, Or on a tree, or in the world? But my late honours from the fair Should the too rigid fates refuse, The loss Fitzmaurice may repair; He may restore a drooping muse. All the prophecy of the “patriarch of the peaceful vale” was completely fulfilled. The tribute that I here payed to Mr. Fitzmaurice, was the tribute of sincere gratitude. But in justice to my sincerity, and to the proper representation of his memory, he afterwards proved quite the reverse.When you enjoy your virtuous mind, Your evening-walk, in Wickham's wood, Along the grove that seems designed By nature to receive the good; When Sol withdraws his blaze of light; When stillness holds the dying breeze; And when the silver orb of night Hints meditation through the trees; When your humane affections burn, To man's assistance ever nigh; Sometimes to my inscription turn, And read it with a friendly eye. A PROLOGUE Spoken at Portsmouth, by MRS. HEARD, In the Summer of the Year, 1775. Hither, deputed by theatric friends, Whose humble interest on your will depends, I come;—and aided by the muse's wing, Their cause I plead; my ardent thanks I bring. Ill-fated actors! is there here a mind, Enlarged by thought, by piety refined, That pities not our complicated woes? Or, say, can human bosoms be our foes? Our life with enmity can man relate, And make us themes of ridicule, or hate? Fortune from us withholds her golden store, She dooms us exiles, and she dooms us poor: The judge appals us with tremendous awe; Censure augments each fault, extends each flaw; The world is not our friend, nor the world's law. Yet, thanks to heaven! we make no vain appeal, From those who persecute, to those who feel; I see your souls; they live along my line: In conquering eyes I see compassion shine. The veteran soldier, and the dauntless tar For me forget awhile the deeds of war; Like Romans, generous, and like Romans, brave, They're fierce to conquer; but they're warm to save. Why do I see my benefactors here? Where no melodious Catley charms their ear; No mighty Bobadill, no Shuter's wit Sets in a roar, box, gallery, and pit; For our great Lear's dread storm no thunders roll; No Garrick agitates, and thrills the soul. You sit not here, the borrowed sigh to heave, In the bard's luxury of woe to grieve; Your's is a god-like pleasure;—to relieve. I kneel with reverence to superior powers; Yours is the glorious part; the feeling ours; Your merit to requite, our hearts aspire; You nobly act; with transport we admire. Oh! cease not thus to act, at heaven's high call, Whose eye paternal sees a sparrow fall; Who gives his azure skies, his genial sun, to all. THE VOLUPTUARY. A SONG. WRITTEN IN THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR 1770. I care not, ye Gods, for the breath of a name; I request only pleasure: give great men their fame. I seek not through ages my glory to spread; Let me live, while I live; and when buried, be dead. May I find a retreat, where the sense of our isle, And it's liberty flourish, with spring's constant smile; Where the softness of climate makes pleasure of ease Where fragrance, and health are conveyed in each breeze.‘ Then in verdure embowered, will I often recline; And thank for his foliage the God of the vine. Yet let not life's current inactively roll; Let my friend, nymph, and bottle, give play to my soul. May I sometimes read authours who wrote like Montaigne, Who speak to the fancy, but plague not the brain; And when a gay hour brings chimerical views As I sport with my mistress, I'll sport with my muse. Thus the pale spectre, care, may I still chace away, My night crowned with rapture, with pleasure, my day; From the lumber of life, and it's knavery released; The lye of the statesman, the gloom of the priest. I care not ye gods, for the breath of a name; I request only pleasure; give great men their fame; Let me live to myself, while to others they shine; Let theirs be the cloud; let the Juno be mine. TO THE AUTHOR OF A POEM, JUST PUBLISHED, entitled THE DYING NEGRO. Accept, pathetic bard, these generous lays; A poet will not spurn a poet's praise. With gratitude I own the liberal aid That saves me from oblivion's dreary shade. Let me the same benevolence pursue, And bring a genius forth to public view. While we at once to fame in song aspire, Though I be worsted, let me fan thy fire. This offering of a feeling heart I make, Both for thy verses, and thy virtue's sake; For thy warm patronage of nature's plan— I fear the rival, but I love the man. May all the curses which thy youth implores With speedy ruin reach West Indian shores! Oh! may the Negroes, with an iron rod, Avenge the cause of Nature, and of God! May they in happy combination rise, Torture their doom, or liberty their prize; Rush with resistless fury on their foes, By one great effort expiate Afric's woes; Eager each mark of slavery to efface, Of their pale tyrants murder all the race! When thus I see chastised the worst of crimes, Of all black deeds in old and modern times; A vengeance worthy of the heavenly throne; Then (nor before that period) will I own That priests are not industrious to deceive; Then will my mind be open to believe That Christ, or Israel's awful king of kings, Minutely regulates terrestrial things. And as the poet's warm expansive soul Spreads it's benevolence from pole to pole, Loves man, his brother, in Siberian snow, Or where the spicy gales of Afric blow; Then I'll enjoy the Negro's happy lot, His purling rivulet, his peaceful cot; Behold him, stretched beneath a fragrant shade, Breathe fervid accents to a sable maid; Or pass, in mirth, and festal song, the day, Streams, groves, and hills responsive to his lay: No northern ruffian near, importing woes, No ruthless Christian to disturb repose! But when will Time, with swift, indignant wing When will he realize the bliss I sing? Fancy still brings me some romantic theme, Still mocks the poet with some pleasing dream. Let Reason, then, her vagrant flight restrain; So let her wish, as not to wish in vain; Returning to the bard she's proud to praise, Image the scenes that should adorn his days; Those pleasures which to worth are sometimes given, Or by blind chance, or providential Heaven. Ever, thou ardent patron of mankind, May the bard's happiness impress thy mind; Our best enjoyments mayst thou ever prove, In learned ease, in poetry, and love. For surely love must in the bosom reign Of one who sings in such a tender strain. For most his powerful empire poets know, The source from which their bliss, and torment flow, Their sweetest pleasure, and their bitterest woe. But mayst thou ne'er admire a rigorous fair, Doomed by her frowns a prey to pallid care; Condemned intenser agony to feel Than Damien suffered on his bed of steel. Rather to thee may joyless seasons roll, No inspiration beaming on thy soul: May the coy Nine their influence never give; In dead stagnation may'st thou seem to live; May thy cold mind be destitute of song; Mayst thou degenerate to the vulgar throng. Ingenuous is thy bard; he'll not pretend He only meant thy genius to befriend; Partly the love of self this tribute drew; He mourns his misery while he praises you. His love too suffers Fortune's dire controul; Thy hero's exit shook his tortured soul. Of painful life inspired, the gloomy state; He wished, but trembled to embrace his fate. I live tormented by a cruel fair— But Passion, hold—awhile reproach forbear. Oft blundering chance defeats the generous will; Confusion reigns; the world is chaos still. She, haply, whom I've rashly deemed severe, Now for her lover drops a tender tear; Haply this verse is not addressed in vain To her who felt, who loved my bolder strain: And if it meets her more expressive eye, The rosy lustre from her cheek may die; Her heart may soften on each plaintive line, And melt with sorrows only less than mine. But should in her the sex's love of sway Mark me to female tyranny a prey; Should she adopt the trifling woman's part, Amused her fancy, but unmoved her heart; Should she return my passion with disdain, Nor change my iron for a silken chain; Then let me seek the refuge of the grave, Scorn to exist, a despicable slave; The bauble, life, with firm contempt resign— The dying negro's brave despair be mine. Clitander. July 1, 1773. TO HENRY COLLINGWOOD, SELBY, ESQ. From these penates, which true friends, of late, (Not one, a bishop) met to consecrate, Through thy life's tenour may be given to flow, Pleasures as durable as man can know! May peace this ground salute with downy wing; Round this gay spot may joy her chaplets fling: Here may our souls, the rosy god of wine Ne'er madden, or oppress, but oft refine; Here oft may Cupid, from his purple plumes, Shake all his passion with his rich perfumes! And may the souls of that convivial day Be long recorded by my zealous lay! Rundell, a favorite guest at Comus' court, Who sense and humour blends with social sport; And in your annals long unfaded shine, The good, gay, friendly brothers from the Tyne; Of steady worth one born the palm to share, One, by bold sallies, to subdue the fair; Dunbar, whose page gives force to Virtue's aim, A scottish phenix, fired with Freedom's flame: Field, who, by Fortune's caprice ne'er depressed, Meets her worst frowns with a determined breast; Whom in the spring of life the poet knew, When Fancy still enjoyed some brilliant view; Long ere Adversity's black storms arose; Long ere my genius had procured me foes. Oh! thou, whose ear with pleasure hears my strains, Whose heart participates my joys, and pains! Like a mere vain, and versifying elf, Let me refer yet longer to myself: In Twickenham's vicinage, oh! let me turn An ardent look to Pope's funereal urn! Shall I forget, on thy convivial day, How inspiration dignified my way!— The fane of Twickenham oped; thy poet found The strong effects of consecrated ground: Now warmth, now chillness through my vitals crept; My heart's pulsation paused, and now it leapt. The spot was shown me where his ashes lie; I viewed the grave with reverential eye: The aile seemed jealous for the mighty dead, And bade his humble votary softly tread: My mind's impressions met my listening ear; And Echo said,—“The God of Pope is here.” Ye bards, how great Heaven's intellectual plan Was shown, in forming our stupendous man! His image raised me far from earth; at once I pitied Warton, and each impious dunce: The church I left, with just ideas stored; Admired the poet, but the God adored. A NEW HYMN, FOR EASTER SUNDAY, 1785; COMPOSED FOR THE CHURCH OF LESBURY. To be sung immediately before the Sermon: O thou! whose son, for mortal man, Descended from the skies; Pleased to perform his Father's plan, To live, to die, to rise! Lead us in Virtue's sacred road, From this auspicious day; Teach us, the gifts which Christ bestowed, Like Christians to repay. From the pure terms of baptism's birth, Ne'er let us idly roam: Our spot of pilgrimage, this earth; Heaven, our eternal home! Death will our soul's best powers unfold, And give them vigorous wing; As winter's damps, and piercing cold, Are followed by the spring. TO LADIES KILLING WASPS WITH OIL. Men, rough, and bold, for evil, or for good, Oft stain their laurels with a brother's blood. By slaughter, Philip's son was Persia's lord; A million victims fell to Cæsar's sword. Your gentle souls are in your myrtle seen; It's blossoms candid, and benign it's green; You urge your conquests with a tender mind; In frowns, enchanting, and in ruin, kind; Even noxious blood your nature cannot spill: You cure with balsam, or with balsam kill. If, then, the real wasps, or wasps, in tongue, Still sure to sting: for still with envy stung; If not one human wasp, in word, or deed, By your avenging hand will ever bleed; If justice thus refined, to them steps forth, Compassion ne'er will be denied to worth. Oh! let the sex, first blessing from the sky, By whom, at once, we wish to live, and die, In empire merciful, from torture save The lives devoted, of the good, and brave! Let poets, too, resign their tuneful breath To soft resentment, to an oily death! Ross, Wednesday, August 14th, 1793. FRANCE;—ORLEANS;—LANSDOWNE. In that cursed land, whence Virtue long had flown; Where vice, gigantick vice, spurned either throne; Murdered the monarch of it's fair domain; Waged impious war with Heaven's eternal reign;— With disposition faithful to her creed, Blackened each hour with some atrocious deed; The hoary priest was butchered in the fane; Beauty's resistless pathos pled, in vain: The fiend, consistent, who had steeled all hearts Against their feeling for ingenuous arts, By which, at once, we're strengthened, and refined, By which blows all the beauty of the mind; With a new tragic pall enforced her scene: Obdurate, slew, a fair, a helpless queen; (Yet genuine virtue, true religion thought Her sufferings had atoned for every fault.) Ingenious, next, her tenets to display; To fix her civil, and her moral sway, More poison still she breathes;—her subject elves Lead to the church an emblem of themselves; To a bright deity exalt a whore; Their mimick Freedom, in the trull, adore; Where Piety, and Christ, were throned, before. To sage Reflexion be my verse applied;— 'Midst these associates, Orleans lived, and died. How high our virtuous energy may soar, Reason obeyed; and Passion heard, no more! How low we sink, when Vice, without controul, Usurps her dark dominion of the soul! So strongly, he corroborates my theme; Such a dire outcast, in the bad extreme; That even his own indignant faction hurled Their prince, and culprit, to the nether world: He was too great a monster for the times; The Jacobins themselves abhorred his crimes. Mortals, unsteady! mortals, never wise! Prone to distrust the Sovereign of the skies! Let not the chain, called by the thoughtless, Fate;— The suffering poor; the proud insulting great;— The state-assassins of the sage, and good, Who stain their native soil with generous blood,— Appal your faith; in every trying hour, Await the mandates of Celestial Power! Already, in the realms of France are given Strong retributions of judicial Heaven. A gleam, even now, predicts, with orient ray, Of Peace, and order, the meridian day; But ere that salutary day shall shine, Diffusing equal laws, and acts benign, The King of Kings will vindicate the slain; And launch his bolt at the blaspheming train: Apostate priests, too late, the truth aver; An Orleans haunts, and summons, a Santerre;— The golden sceptre beaming on the just, Displays the Power, in whom mankind should trust; Each murdering atheist feels his iron rod; And thus each atheist clearly proves a God. Windsor Great Park, Nov. 23, 1793. ON MISS WILLIS. TO LAURA. When Laura enforces her empire, with ease, Her beauty to charm, and her talents to please; When, diffusing love's gentle, yet mighty controul, Her eye strikes each inmost recess of the soul; In life's drama I still find my delicate part; But I thank the hard steel that environs my heart; The steel that has grown, by salabrious time, Who corrects the wild ardour of love, and of rhyme: (Oh! skreen me, old God! from the shafts of the fair; And give to my verse a more dignified air!) But should that unfortunate steel have one pore; Her fire will pervade me, and life is no more: For who would live longer in exquisite pains; From new joys interdicted by rusty old chains! Then take the bright Stella; yes, take all her glow (Sincerely my numbers for ever shall flow!) Take her mirth (as enchanting as Venus's laugh!) From whose sallies her lovers ebriety quaff; Take her smiles that the sneer of old virgins defy; Take the rose of her cheek, and the jet of her eye; Take, in her, of enjoyment as luscious a store As the prophet ere promised his soldiers before;— If hate would relent, and but give me the other; And make me in flesh as in spirit, thy brother: Would give me concentered all feminine charms (For my head is ambitious, ambitious, my arms!) Give me graces external, but graces refined; Where each attitude speaks, from the force of the mind; Where sense in each word, common sense must descry; Where an oracle guides, in each glance of her eye: Where virtue corrects lighter passion's alarms; All Pallas's wisdom, with Venus's charms. 'Midst the world's motley freaks, which all opposites blend, I should know what the power of Olympus intend, With regard to myself:—were I perfectly free; Young, handsome, and wealthy, and worthy of thee! But thy soul is exalted; it flows in a strain Too good to be proud, and too great to be vain; Then, superiour to scarlet, to nonsense, and youth; It frowns not on learning; on talents; on truth: It, surely, was formed, human ills to redress; Whom fortune had cursed, with it's favours to bless; To soften the woes of life's jacobine scene; Not to spurn my grey hairs, if my laurels are green. Monmouth, Nov. 16th, 1704. VERSES TO MISS DALTON, ON HER APPROACHING BIRTH-DAY. Since time, still stealing on, with footstep near Brings the commencement of thy natal year; Accept these lines, void of poetick art; The simple offering of an honest heart. May thy progressive years be crowned with health; I breathe no prayer for title, or for wealth; From wealth, and title, oft, keen misery springs; Refute me, if you can, ye reigning kings! The shade of Louis meets the poet's eye; And ratifies my doctrine with a sigh: Owns that he envied his poor gallic swains: No blood of Henry rolling through their veins. May thy external form, too apt to share The first attention of the thoughtless fair, Have all thy proper, secondary care. But think what pleasures heaven for thee designed; Think of thy reasoning, thy immortal mind; Still raise that noble principle from earth; And still anticipate it's second birth; When delegates from heaven shall speed it's way To the bright regions of eternal day. Hence, teach it, in it's mortal state, to soar; The right, the good, the beauteous to explore; To tread the path which the great sages trod; The path which leads, through virtue, up, to God! Ne'er may the light amusements of our age Divert thy leisure from instruction's page: For vital spirit, to the dead apply; They teach us how to live, and how to die; The world unnerves us; but these friends controul, Refine, exalt, and fortify the soul; By them, we firmly act our part assigned; Impassive to the caprice of mankind. Oh! mayst thou through the dangerous sea of life, With winds, and waves, maintain a conquering strife! Or, may thy bark before fair breezes fly, The coast elysian blooming in thine eye! Let Johnson's ethicks be thy card, to sail; Let Pope's fine passion give that card a gale; Still may thy choice of books true taste express; And scorn the female refuse of the Press. Sometimes relaxed, let fancy's playful wings Sport with gay trifles as inferiour things. Important errour ever mayst thou shun; Nor e'er mistake a meteor for the sun; The sun, with generous, with impelling force, Our nature cheers, and animates our course; The meteor shoots a momentary ray; Shrinks, dies, and mocks us, with delusive day. Thus, reason prompting, tempering thy desires, Shall yield the virtue's fixed, and genial fires; Their lustre ne'er exchanged for idle show; In youth, our folly; and in age, our woe; Thus, ne'er reduced by tinsel, wilt thou blend The low, pert coxcomb with the zealous friend. Monmouth, Dec. 29, 1794. AN EPITAPH. Here lies of Sanby the terrestrial part; The fire ethereal which inspired his heart, Was unallayed with disingenuous art. Yet liberal art adorned his active mind; His love, not to his family confined, Flamed for his friends; and felt for human kind. His humble soul, now raised on ardent wings, From the poor princely spot where Stockdale sings, Meets (with no Lord between) the king of kings. Great Windsor-Park, October 4th, 1796. VERSES ON THE DEATH OF THE EMPRESS OF RUSSIA. Quiet, at length, imperial Catharine lies: At length!—mysterious goodness of the skies! With lust, and blood, polluted was her reign; Yet old she died; expiring without pain! But let strong moral truth exalt my theme; And every doubt of righteous Heaven redeem. If Body 'scapes;—there is a pain of soul; Not wealth, nor grandeur can it's pangs controul. The worthy man, to dreadful exile sent, By her, whose nature knew not to relent; Compared with her, enjoyed a blissful doom; His powerful virtue bade Siberia bloom. For long before this fiend resigned her breath, She agonized whene'er she thought of death; Forbade her slaves the mournful rites to pay, To friends deceased, beneath the solar ray: Funerals, at Petersburgh, were veiled by night; Lest majesty should meet the killing sight. Thus royal criminals all bounds defy; And thus they make their hell, before they die. But Europe has it's kings exempt from thought; Who feel no misery by their madness wrought; Nimrods who laugh, and stun us with a joke; While death on millions drives the fatal stroke; While from fair empires freedom far is fled; Oppressed, their subjects; and their glory, dead; Their poor, 'midst luxury, wanting daily bread: While hard unfeeling instruments of state, With iron bosoms aggravate their fate. Know such—on tyrants, in the future world, The last excess of penal fire is hurled: Know such—if not insensible to fame; Some great historian all his rights will claim; Time to his pen shall full expression give; Than Belsham's bolder, while his heroes live. Some godlike poet will his ardour join; Paint sceptered culprits in his glowing line: To late posterity the strain shall flow; And deathless verse avenge a nation's woe. Bishop's Gate; by Windsor Great Park. Thursday, Dec. 29, 1796. ON MY GOING TO LIVE AT WINDSOR. Hail, sacred Windsor! hallowed are thy shades By poets, and their nine inspiring maids! Though now I seek, in thee, my last repose, From many generous toils, and many woes; Yet let me, sometimes, urge my favourite course; To Fancy give her scope, and splendid force; With our great bards to hold a noble strife, Be my ambition, on the verge of life: For but a few remaining years have I; “Just time to look about me, and to die.” So sung harmonious Pope; and as he sung, His Cooper's-Hill more fragrant odours flung: His Thames's banks with heavenly musick rung. Checked was the current of the silver stream, While it's god listened to the tuneful theme. Binfield, and Twickenham, hail! at sober eve, Oft Abelard, and Eloisa leave Their aromatick amaranthine grove; Their bliss elysian, through thy walks to rove: There softly sighs that other See the elegy to the memory of an unfortunate lady. hapless dame; And soothes her passion where it sprung to fame: Aërial harps repeat the plaintive sound; And Love, and Genius consecrate the ground. Binfield, thy name with varied rapture warms, Blest in a poet; blest in female charms! There Buckeridge reads what Pope divinely wrote; Glows as she reads, and loses not a thought: Her feeling soul the varied notes inspire With Freedom's bold, or Love's more gentle fire. Perusing, thus, my mind's distinguished fate, The little pomp of the factitious great; Still with unconquered spirit let me view, To independence, and the muses, true. Oh! may these objects all my thoughts refine; Impel my conduct, and inspire my line! Ennoble, and enlarge my moral plan; Make me the friend, but not the slave of man; Teach me respect even for my king to feel, Only as he promotes the public weal; Proudly to spurn all homage to a lord; Unless his title, and his deeds accord. But let the poor; the friendless; the distressed; Scorned by the rich; avoided by the rest; Plead with decisive pathos, in my breast. When lords of millions not a mite bestow, Even I may mitigate a brother's woe. May I, when languid in the negro's cause, On English ground, in vain imploring laws! Be torne by ruffians from my native shore, Like him; and destined ne'er to view it more: Possess, while eager to resign my breath, But a mere coffin's room, before my death! Thus may the muse her noblest powers impart; Instruct my mind, and purify my heart; Tutored by her, without a painful sigh, With the soul's setting sun-shine may I die; Tread the dark path, with vivid hope in God, Which Rome's Ire tamen restat Numa quo devenit, et Ancus. —Horace. Pompilius, and her Ancus trod! VERSES on THE FIRE AT CLIFDEN. While near Arcadian Wye's meandering stream, Whose objects might excite the noblest theme, My fallow mind uncultivated lay; And dozed, with other drones, it's hours away; Of lofty Clifden's fall the dread report (Majestick, relative to Taplow-court!) Where Thames through ground more consecrated flows, Rouzed the dull slumberer from his Welsh repose. Thou fiery god! could no soft thoughts asswage The mad invasion of thy wanton rage? Oh! had kind Venus, at the fatal hour, When Clifden bowed to thy destructive power, Armed with the cestus of almighty love, Which, Heaven can witness, quelled the thundering Jove!— Oh! had she, flushed with all her beauty, pressed The sable Vulcan to her snowy breast; Then might the poet's quick, and fertile eye, Which, in a moment, peoples all the sky; Mark, that the Cyprian queen, with moral grace Improved her air, and dignified her face; From savage freaks allured her spouse, to prove The sacred pleasures of connubial love; Watched o'er the welfare of the virtuous fair; Clifden, and it's best ornament, her care. Old Nestor-like, I vainly wish to see The days, O Inchiquin! I passed with thee! When, from thy social, and thy generous heart, I felt a noble, and a friendly part; When rural scenes together we pursued; And all the charms of Bucks, and Berkshire viewed; Stopped, in our course, at Clifden's hallowed shades; Well known to Phœbus, and the tuneful maids; And our attention while the dome engaged, Pleased with the glorious wars, which, once, she waged, Wars, by art's emulative genius wrought— The times, again, we realized, in thought, “When Anne commanded, and when Marlborough fought.” To Taplow's roof convivial, we returned; Again our hearts with honest ardour burned; Homage, again, we payed to Anna's reign; As great in bards, as in the martial train;— But lightly skimmed o'er Addison's campaign. The genial claret brightened the soul's flow; It burnished every image with it's glow! Old as I am, I love to entertain In Fancy's region, the romantick strain: Then, with my youthful constitution's powers, To bear the jolly god's inspiring hours; Might my experience, dearly bought, controul, With prudent sway, the sallies of the soul! Thus, I should feel, at one propitious time, Health, strength, and reason, in their manly prime: Then, I should write; and then, converse, at ease; Though borne on Fancy's aromatick breeze. Thou pagan god!—to fire that Christian ground, Where Cowley's lyre diffused her silver sound! Where Denham, to the guardians of the wood; To Pan, Sylvanus, and the neighbouring flood, With rapture passed his tributary strain; Grand as the Thames, when he salutes the main.— Near Binfield, too; where all the wondering nine New musick heard, in Pope's preluding line; And still they owned, with grateful transport fired, That he improved the notes which they inspired! The good, the great, the fair, the princely guest, Have all that celebrated mansion blessed; Yet, by respect for them, thy rage was not repressed. There Thomson's blooming, and creative mind, On every season, as it rose, refined: There, Lyttelton, the tender friend of man, Enriched the poet's, and the patriot's plan. There Frederick felt what soothes when grandeur fails; And verse, and virtue, charmed a Prince of Wales. Methinks, some pupil of the atheist's creed; Some young French monster, who hath read Candide— Some superficial scholar of Voltaire; From Clifden's fire takes an important air;— Asks me, why Vulcan's all-devouring flames Made no distinction 'twixt two noble dames; Asks me, why Heaven applies not acts of grace, With more precision to the human race; Why Clifden's pomp dissolved in fervid air, Why Orkney, not, when Shrewsbury was there? Thou fool! like every other impious elf, Thou forgest weapons, to transfix thyself! Clifden was burned, because the Eternal Mind A nobler mansion for the good designed; Because this world is but a rugged road, O'er which we travel to the blest abode;— A state, when this inferiour path is trod, Varied, and boundless, as the works of God! A state, which Fortune's fools combine to prove;— The golden chain of universal love, Blind to their moral consequence, they hold;— The chain, which Clarke, and Newton first unfold; Pleased with its' links, depending from on high; To draw mistaken mortals to the sky! Suffering, and patient virtue's quiet course, Yet gives our argument resistless force; She points distinctly, to a milder clime, Fruitful of joys, that mock the waste of time. Even Vice's triumphs, in her impious dream, Evince the goodness of the Power Supreme; They indicate the soul's perpetual youth; And fix it's pleasures on the base of truth. Monmouth, Wednesday, January 27th, 1796. AN ODE, ON LORD NELSON'S VICTORY over THE DANES. 1801. Again thou inspirest!—I fly to my pen; Thy deeds to emblazon, thou bravest of men! Nor should Nelson a muse independent disdain; When her poet is proud to make one of thy train: For pervious to fancy all stations are found; She rejoiced at the Nile; she exults at the Sound. Thus in Rome to their height, arts, and victories grew; Still the Nine with her eagles triumphantly flew. Of war, from the south to the north, spread the fire; And Horace rekindled it's flame, on his lyre. But from Calpe to Ganges, by Rome were there found Such laurels as bloom on the Nile, and the Sound? Ye croakers, at length, drop your dissonant voice; Of our worthies employed rail no more at the choice: Yet your mere opposition but rivets their claim; It fixes, immortal, each luminous name. Ever near the bright substance of merit is found Of dark envy the shade, from the Nile to the Sound. Hereafter, your malice; your impotent rage, Shall our history transmit, in her durable page; Contrasted with patriots, the factious unfold, As captives, and slaves graced the triumphs of old: For since first the sun rose, from the Nile to the Sound, Where a hero sprung up, a Thersites was found. Unequalled exploits will with ease be believed; When a Pitt formed the plan which a Nelson atchieved. Blest isle! for thy strength; for thy fame are combined, The brave pulse of the heart; the vast powers of the mind! For say, can such valour; such talents be found, If glory we trace from the Nile to the Sound! ON THE SECOND MEMORABLE VICTORY, AT ABOUKIR. 1801. What favoured bard can sing as Britons fight! Some glorious Milton on the theme should write. Yet, for the tribute of ingenuous praise, True criticks will approve imperfect lays. Parent of wealth, and arts! all-fruitful Nile! Doomed, in late years, on England's fame to smile; Doomed to exalt our celebrated isle; And, say, can all thy boasted records claim Aught more illustrious than the British name? What though thy pyramids, immensely high, From their vast bases rise, and threat the sky; What, in thy annals, though Sesostris reigns, The mighty Lord of Asia's distant plains;— What, though of science Egypt was the tree; And various learning ramified from thee! No greater prodigy thy history shows Than Britons moving to their Gallick foes. The tar; the soldier, every danger braves; Alike intrepid on the land, and waves. In rows terrifick, from the hostile shore, Pregnant with fate, in vain the cannons roar; Ardent each hero sails, or marches on, Anticipating death, or laurels won; This maxim painted on his mental eye; “The brave live honoured, and lamented die.” A line of Pope's translation of the Iliad. The annoying mountain; the French army finds Heights far superior in our English minds. But when will Peace resume her golden reign! When shall we cease to mourn our heroes slain; Fancy reposing on Arcadia's plain! The stream of Providence unerring flows; All glory still it moderates with woes; They by celestial wisdom are applied, To temper human joy, and human pride. Thus, when the favourite theme of British praise Caught a new splendour in our Nelson's days; When England's military standard bore Peculiar honours not acquired before; The king of terrours, in the martial fray, Marked with more dire events the prosperous day; Heaven's awful agent, for his ruthless dart, Was watchful to select some generous heart: And to refine on every dreadful aim; To balance fortune, and to balance fame; That grief most pungent might embalm the dead, The brave, the virtuous Abercromby bled! Lesbury, near Alnwick, Northumberland, May 23d, 1801. AN EPITAPH ON A VERY PRETTY AND MOST AMIABLE CAT. They who are disposed to ridicule the love, and attention which every good heart will give to kind, faithful, and grateful animals, must be unacquainted with the nature, and habits of those animals, when they are treated as it is our duty to treat them: and they must likewise ascribe to the prevailing human character infinitely more merit, and dignity, than it possesses. That there are many monsters of inhumanity amongst mankind, is demonstrated by the various, and horrible barbarities with which those very useful, and affectionate animals (if we deserve their affection) are tormented, and destroyed, which are of the species of the little creature, the loss of whose engaging qualities I deeply regret. Mischance, which only with my life will end, Hath robbed me of a dear, though humble friend. This primrose marks the spot where TIBSY lies; Learn worth from her, ye proud; ye rich; ye wise! Ingratitude grow generous, if you can; And let the animal improve the man. Pride, to corruption destined from it's birth, It's pomp expired, like her, must rot in earth: Her wants, that never strayed from nature's rules, Reproved the mental fevers of our fools; She ne'er was tortured with the miser's pain; Nor with the last resources of the vain. Her mind, not philosophically great, Had all the knowledge proper for her state; Ne'er wished through metaphysick wilds to roam; But kept at common sense's wiser home. To kind, and constant friends, her love sincere Demands the tribute of a pious tear; Their tender words well to her heart were known; Which answered in a soft, pathetick tone; Ingratitude was never her disgrace; She left that stigma to the human race. Perhaps, to her, in blest elysian fields, Some little bower it's fragrant foliage yields; Perhaps, where generous dogs, and horses stray, She basks, and sports in everlasting day; Haply, some friend, with my affection, there, Receives her tender voice through purer air. Lie light this turf on gentle TIBSY's head; His genial influence, here, let zephyr shed; Let summer's warmth, succeeding vernal showers, Adorn her grave with aromatick flowers! Lesbury, Saturday, April 16th, 1803. VERSES ON THE ABOLITION OF THE SLAVE TRADE. While iron hearts of the commercial race, Dead to the feelings of each moral grace, To Afric's woes refuse the just relief; Fell agents of their pandemonian chief; Who fires his advocates; his chosen band; Though legislators to a Christian land: See heaven-born genius noble thoughts display! Illumined with it's GOD'S paternal ray! His favourite sons, harmonious with His mind; Destined to govern, and protect mankind; The cause of freedom ardently maintain; Crush, o'er the Atlantic, Satan's ruthless reign; The truly great are ever the humane. Born to be free, brave children of the sun! White cruelty, at length, it's course hath run. For you I oft have poured the plaintive strain; When oft I felt, for you, transmitted pain. A line from that glorious tragedy, the Revenge.“Let Afric, and her hundred thrones rejoice!” Let Christians join their warm applauding voice! If selfish, vulgar tyrants urge their plan; The slow, deliberate murderers of man; Debase GOD'S image in the human soul; And sink it with their dark, and dire controul; Ethereal minds diffuse their cheering light, And quell the demons of eternal night; Like Sol, to bless the universe, they shine; Bright emanations of the POWER DIVINE! Lesbury, June 13th, 1804. A POETICAL TRIBUTE TO THE MEMORY OF LORD NELSON INSCRIBED, WITH GREAT RESPECT, TO THE HONOURABLE CHARLES GREY. Nelson, with all the patriot's ardour fired, Like our great Wolfe, in victory's arms expired. Triumphant Calpe, on the hostile shore, Heard the last thunder of his cannon roar; Firm as our hero, with a proud disdain, It claimed our empire o'er the land, and main. Oft had he suffered for his country's good; His laurels oft took vigour from his blood; Where'er our fleets unfurled their prosperous sails, His glory flew with as propitious gales. May thy illustrious deeds, in history's page, With dignity be told, to every age; May, to present thee to admiring eyes, A Dionysius, or a Livy rise! Shall feeble age endeavour to throw forth Some strong ideas, to express thy worth? Though long the British flag hath ruled the sea, It's bravest heroes were excelled by thee; The shades of Hawke, and of Boscawen shine With fainter glories, when compared with thine. This praise to a new height exalts thy name; Thus, on the summit placed, of human fame. Lesbury, Nov. 9th, 1805. AN EPITAPH ON MR. PITT. Quoad humanum genus incolume manserit; quamdiu usus literis, honor summæ eloquentiæ pretium erit; quamdiu rerum natura, aut fortuna steterit, aut memoria duraverit; admirabile posteris vigebis ingenium. aurelius puscus; de cicerone. The first of Statesmen has resigned his breath; But fame immortal will succeed his death. Unequalled genius, he, through every age Or of the Grecian, or the Roman page! Destined he was by nature, to controul The fine emotions of the human soul: While by his oratory's copious tide His friends were borne along with rapturous pride; His honest foes were wont their praise to pay; And opposition heard it's rage away. Contrasted talents were in him combined; Command of temper, and command of mind: He, whom an ardent eloquence inspired; Who, while he spoke, his listening audience fired; Knew to improve the public solid health; And fix the sources of a nation's wealth. Short was his life, but large the space it ran; Ambition blazed through his extended plan! While virtue's light serene adorned the man. Lesbury, near Alnwick, Jan. 26, 1806. ON THE ANTIQUITIES OF MONMOUTHSHIRE: A BOOK, JUST PUBLISHED. Monmouth! in print thou art not doomed to shine! A sculptor vile, a vile historian, thine! Dexterous, the one, to tumble rocks on houses; The other wight your just resentment rouses, While character he injures, or confounds; His satire lies, even his encomium wounds! His periods not with silk, but pack-thread strung, Expose the cobler of his mother-tongue! Ingenious artist! happy to display Men, who in arms, or letters, bear the sway! How faintly Homer's favourite warriour shines, Compared with him, who decorates thy lines! His hero was a butcherly French trooper; Thine is the bright, and peaceful Dr. Hooper! Thy memoirs, faithless to the social scene, Debase a Griffin, agonize a Green; Give Lewis no due tribute of the heart; But only crown him with a ploughman's art: Praise, for dull botany, his daughter fair; Formed to excite, and feel, a finer care! Preposterous times! that give each folly birth! They, who may chuse their studies, cling to earth; While o'er them, golden orbs unnumbered roll, Which press the God upon the reasoning soul! Yet Griffin better talents recommend Even to the praise of a pretended friend: In him, a classick sense, a taste prevails; Not the cold genealogy of Wales:— And if, as Williams tells us, Green is vain; His heart feels little agonizing pain. Paternal heaven! to me, whose genial power With mental ardour cheers the lonely hour; Oh! ever from thy suppliant's mind avert A frost, impassive to humane desert! Lewis, perhaps, is not prepared to see A mite of honest homage payed by me; But still fair Truth commands my verse to flow; Hence, I have some dear friends, and many a foe. This man deserves an eulogy more warm Than Williams gives;—the rustick skill to form: Priests breathe a blessing on the hungry poor; They, loaded with his bounty leave his door; Like Job, he searches their disputed cause; And saves them from some harpy of the laws. Had Bethlehem's star, of humble swains the guide; Of souls, unclouded with pedantick pride; On thee benighted, beamed, with friendly ray, With all the light of evangelick day; Ideas, in thy brain, had held no dance Of anarchy, thou citizen of France! The whole creation frets an impious mind; To enemies, unjust, to friends, unkind. Not so, the soul, who views our blooming shore; Our haven fair, when life's rude storms are o'er; To him a luminous, bold road is shown; He marches on; and fears his God alone; Strives to make tyrants, and oppressors, feel; Though shields of gold protect their hearts of steel: In rags, his best, his noblest friend, can see; If virtue warms his heart, and keeps him free.— Oh! Virtue, all-sufficient! at thy school, My health invigorate; and my passions rule! Thy pure; thy frugal; yet thy generous plan, Throws us on God; far from the dread of man! Thy influence acts a doubly glorious part; Improves the mind, while it refines the heart: The Christian simple, yet exalted laws, Enforce the pictures which Longinus draws. A hope, defeating all the wrecks of time, The soul habituates to a strain sublime; Ensures the man's; promotes the writer's fate;— What makes us good, conspires to make us great. Monmouth, Sunday, April 24th, 1796. THE PHILOSOPHER. A POEM. ? In se totus teres atque rotundus. HORACE. His soul self-balanced, he disdains The world's factitious joys and pains. 1801. Courage, my long-afflicted heart; Assume the moral hero's part: To fortune's unremitted blows Determined sentiments oppose; And since a late oppressive stroke Thy force almost entirely broke; Thy aims to nobler objects turn; And her capricious empire spurn; Nor with the phantom more be vexed, Who smiles this hour, and frowns the next. Distinguish, man, with steddy view, Deceitful happiness from true; Look round this sublunary sphere, Survey the many gewgaws here; Then look within the human mind, For mighty purposes designed; That can examine nature's laws, And thence infer the general cause; Being surrenders not with breath, But is intended after death To mock the wasteful hand of time, And flourish in eternal prime. He then who in this motley state Had rags, and hunger for his fate, Will dart up to the realms of day, Light, airy, and divinely gay; He, haply a distinguished guest, Even in the mansions of the blessed, In imagery will stretch to views Never approached by Milton's muse; And in a moment nature's roll Will give such knowledge to his soul, As ne'er to Newton's ken was brought With all his vast extent of thought: Through regions of unbounded space Shall he creation's wonders trace, More happy still as he pursues The range of his expanded views. These scenes of bliss shall he explore When Phœbus gives his light no more; When Chaos shall resume o'er earth Her sceptre as before its birth; Perhaps when memory shall be fled Of all the celebrated dead; Erased from intellect each name Bright in the roll of present fame; Old Homer's vigorous, lasting lines Sunk into nought with Dutch divines; Cæsar, and Tully, and Rome's pride, By weightier matter shoved aside; Trifles in the celestial sphere, Though awful to a mortal ear. Thus is it with the comet rare; It shoots a flaming length of hair, Ere in it's circuit it hath run Far from the influence of the sun; Is gazed at nightly in our skies, At once with terror, and surprize. But from our world as it retires Distance, and cold contract it's fires; Till it's importance almost o'er, It hardly draws one wonderer more; Weaker and weaker sheds it's light, And dies at length to human sight. Such is our birth-right; should we then, We, rational, immortal men, Whose prospects are, as Heaven, sublime, On sordid scenes employ our time? Should sensual pleasure turn the soul From pressing on to Virtue's goal; Should interest be allowed to blind The moral optics of the mind; With anxious front, and sickly hue, Should she persuade us to pursue Of happiness no higher store Than rounded bits of golden ore? Oh no! and first, ye youthful train, Attend the poet's friendly strain, Who warmly wishes you would steer Your course of Circe's island clear; Her flowery, but her fatal bowers Would murder your important hours; Her goblets of delusive joy, Your health, and happiness destroy. But chief to you with melting eye, My wholesome warning I apply, Whom lively feelings oft expose To indiscretions, and to woes; Being by various views enlarge, And render it a nicer charge; While Dutchmen only know they live As pipe and trade their impulse give; Feelings, which, well-conducted, crown Our life with pleasure and renown; According to the turn they take, A Fenelon, or Wilmot make. But with an irritable frame, So very difficult to tame, If in a capital you live, Your unrelaxed attention give To Vice's pain, to Virtue's prize; Keep them still full before your eyes If but an hour your fancy strays, Perchance you're lost in Folly's maze. For there, in this luxurious age How hard the task is to be sage! There lounging dissipation reigns, And oft her low invention strains In starting some unheard-of toys, To kill the life of bearded boys. Riot in every street is found, And deals disease, and death around: With tenfold force the Cyprian dame Diffuses there her lawless flame; And prosperous villainy stalks there With such an insolence of air, That men are tempted to believe Here our full sentence we receive; That the good, persevering few Miss the reward to merit due; And that the hard, oppressive throng Will never feel for doing wrong; That life presents no better things Than shouts of mobs, and smiles of kings. Preposterous customs these, that bring A transient joy, but lasting sting; Kind, gentle Nature's laws controul, And in a fever keep the soul. There, in a rapid whirlpool tost; The giddy man at length is lost; No leisure in the silent shade The world ideal to pervade; Where every object that you meet Invites to innocent retreat; No leisure to concert a plan, To think of God, and judge of man. But let me from the moral page Of an illustrious, stoic sage Borrow a hint, and with some flowers Created by poetic powers, Try on the maxim to throw light, And make it's beauty shine more bright; A maxim, which, if well impressed, And ever cherished in the breast, Ever the pilot of the soul, As the true needle shows the pole; More fragrant would our virtue bloom, More strong, till the decisive tomb Freed us from dangers which await Our warfare in this nether state. Remember that the life of man, When longest, may be termed a span; That nothing can redeem our breath From grim, inexorable death: And oft reflect on Virtue's pains, Her noisome cells, her galling chains; Think what was Regulus's doom, Victim to honour, and to Rome; Reflect how Socrates expired, By Athens poisoned, though admired; Recall the woes of many a sage, Existing yet in Plutarch's page. Unfashionable poet, I With bolder pinions mean to fly; From worthies of terrestrial line I launch into a theme divine. View the Messiah; he who came From Heaven, and took a human frame; Who deigned for us to dwell below,— Was not his life a scene of woe? Blest purifier of the mind! Blest benefactor to mankind! 'Twas thine philosophy to teach Which even the Stoics could not reach; The body, and the soul to heal, Ever to watch o'er human weal; And whilst the Jews, for doing good, Insulted thee, and sought thy blood, Such a rough tide of misery shed On thy devoted, sacred head; As, whilst we read the inspired page, Horrour excites, and pious rage; Yet mildness still didst Thou oppose To the blind fury of thy foes, Although with one almighty frown Thou could'st have called the thunder down. What does my active fancy see! They nail him to the fatal tree! He, who from nothing into birth Commanded our stupendous earth; He, the dread, universal cause, Who fixed the planetary laws, Kindled the sun, and starry fires— He, by the reptile, man, expires! He on whose gentle, bounteous will Sweet innocence attended still, Whose life was fraught with heavenly deeds— He 'twixt two murdering villains bleeds! All nature sickens at the sight; The frightened sun withholds his light; Earth trembles at her Master's doom, The dead awake, and quit the tomb: Wild Chaos, in the realms below, Exulting hears the tale of woe; And clanks her adamantine chain, Fond to resume her dreary reign! Since then the firmest virtue here To pain so oft must give a tear; And since the Son himself of God 'Scaped not affliction's iron rod; But ever suffering in our stead, He had not where to lay his head; What earthly thing should raise desire Too high, and set the soul on fire? What object is there here so fair As to deserve corroding care? Oh none! kind Heaven did ne'er intend This world for man's momentous end; Not for our ultimate abode, But for Elysium's painful road: He placed us in it to call forth, And to refine our moral worth: Always to earth, would you be wise, Sit loose, and ready for the skies. What present object to our view Can give the world a darker hue Than Corsica's immortal chief, Admired, and yet refused relief; Sinking beneath proud Gallia's weight, Yet still himself, still good, and great! Thou human comet, in our sphere Scarce seen in a five-hundredth year, Paoli!—thy illustrious name Recalls the flower of Roman fame! Not when her chiefs, ambition fired, And gold her sordid thoughts inspired; But when pure, simple virtue ruled, When she the man inflamed, or cooled; When Mucius his mistaken hand Consumed indignant, at the brand; When brave Patricians held the spade; When Fabius gallantly delayed. Yes, when thy image fills the mind, We leave these little times behind; And fancy darts to better days, Productive of immortal praise. By thee o'er Latium is displayed Antiquity's majestick shade; My working mind beholds no more The languor of the Italian shore; It drops the soft, degenerate crew, Their fiddling, painting, and virtù. Methinks I see old Numa rise, An awful form, before my eyes; Poets their sacred fire impart, And rouze to fame the manly heart; Virgil resumes his epick fire, Horace awakes the moral lyre; And mighty Tully I descry; He shoots heaven's lightning from his eye; He wields heaven's thunder in his hand; And the high-priest of heaven's command; With periods copious, sweet, and strong, Electrifies the Roman throng. Stupendous man! thy steady soul Nothing external can controul. Thy vigorous patriotic flame Licentious Naples could not tame; It's manners soft, it's balmy air, Could not thy mental force impair: Proud Genoa, with proud Gallia joined, Served but to rouze thy generous mind; To realize thy god-like plan, And to the hero raise the man. Gallia! though boastful of thy fame, Of human race the scourge, and shame! Polite barbarians! whose fierce joy Is to distress, and to destroy; Misery to stab with deeper wrongs; And then with sacrilegious tongues, 'Tis told us by the shameless elves That honour lives but with themselves! Administration! thou vile thing! Thou foe to subjects, and their king! How does thy baseness urge the fate Of our luxurious, falling state! Soon haply, yet too late may cease The follies of a shameful peace; Mars in his rattling, crimson car May soon call Britain forth to war; When the brave Corsican is slain, And France the pirate of the main. I now imagine that I hear The critick dry with look severe Ask whither all these wanderings tend?— I'll tell you, awful sir, their end. 'Tis, that good deeds we may pursue With steady, unretorted view; Act in the world our part assigned With a disinterested mind; Nor our felicity expose To fortune's, or to human blows: That Virtue's friend may oft reflect All the reward he can expect While living, for the course he steers, Is, his own solitary tears. And that undauntedly we may, If a proud lord comes in our way, Sees our poor habit thread-bare worn, And us, as he concludes, forlorn, And asks us, with disdainful air, To gall us, not relieve us, where Our country, our connections lie, Point, with mute rhetorick, to the sky. Here, critick, I observe my text— You shrug, and say—well, what comes next? In truth I'll ramble yet awhile, And if you frown, why—I shall smile. Say, do you pant for high renown; And would you be transmitted down In History's honourable page, Your country's friend through every age? Ambition Heaven on man bestows, The stock on which perfection grows. But as fierce passion should obey Calm Reason's moderating sway, If to distinction you would rise By some uncommon, great emprize, Your soul let warm ambition feed With vigour for the hardy deed; But let it not with raging fire Excite the fever of desire; Or you relinquish Virtue's laws, Mad for capricious man's applause. Oh! you do wrong, if you lose sight Of the calm, rational delight, The conscientious, modest joy, Raised far above each earthly toy; The rash applauses of the crowd, Unsatisfactory, though loud: If most you wish not to be blessed By pleasing heaven, and your own breast; If this high privilege is lost, No purchase can repay the cost. Genius, and Virtue often here Suffer through life, a fate severe; And genuine worth it's well-earned praise Misses a thousand adverse ways; Closes it's long-expecting eyes Without the gilded, airy prize. Historic sage! from sloth awake, The part of injured Virtue take; Assume the vindicating pen!— Alas! historians are but men; Apt, in what warmly they aver, To speak from party, or to err. If history, well-informed, and just, Discharges her important trust; If there the venerable dead Are fairly in description read; May not the blind, or selfish rage Of some remoter factious age, The patriot spoil of his renown, Tear from his brows the civic crown; By urging old, and modern lies, Rejected by the good, and wise, Of men a hideous picture draw, Whom Virtue mentions yet with awe; Embalms yet with a pious tear— Whom even assassins can revere? Unhappy Charles! thy virtues, rare In those who the regalia wear: The nice, and complicated art Required to act the royal part, When thou wast seated on the throne, Now cannot for thy faults atone. For then bold privilege began, Fierce guardian of the rights of man, With generous, but excessive flame, To urge aloud her noble aim. Prerogative with stately mien, And less the goddess than the queen, Her sceptre shook with vengeful hand; They two o'er Britain's wretched land Political confusion hurled, That stunned our European world. When thus there struggles in a state Some great eruption, big with fate; 'Tis not the most untainted heart, A head endowed with common art, That can the royal function fill, Foresee the shock, and ward the ill: At such a crisis no less king To harmony the realm could bring, Than Prussia's king, of talents great; Or Alfred, of a glorious fate. Unhappy Charles! these cruel days Will not allow thee any praise: Valour, and piety sincere, Were thine, and claim a pitying tear; Thy conduct in domestick life, To servants, children, and thy wife, Could be converted into crimes Only in most abandoned times. Thy grief for an unnatural war, Thy spirit at a ruffian-bar, With as heroic mildness joined, Indexes of a god-like mind, Perverse mankind refuse to prize, Thy errors glaring in their eyes. The axe's sacrilegious blow Sooths not severity with woe; Even fashionable Hume in vain Is tender of thy hapless reign. But rash Macauley, how couldst thou Thy sex's softness disavow; Fired with presumption seize the pen, And dictate government to men? Woman impertinent, and vain, Intruder on the learned train! Go, manage thy affairs at home; Go, guide the spindle, and the loom; As Hector told his tender wife, Incroaching on his martial life. Consult thy heart; dost thou pretend To be mankind's impartial friend? Thy family's licentious spleen In thy invenomed page is seen: Hadst thou a Jacobite been bred, Different chimeras in thy head Would then have floated; kingly power Would then in thy romantick hour Have dictatorially been shown, Responsible to God alone; Poor Charles would then have been divine, And patriots all the Stuart-line. Unluckily thy wayward youth, Not fit for complicated truth Beyond it's limits stretched it's views, And ancient history would peruse; Which fired the tender, female brain, Like the quick essence of Champagne. Intoxicated with these fumes, The heroine her pen assumes; And heedless as a woman's tongue, Her declamation foams along. The London buck, at midnight hour, Thus feels the bacchanalian power; Burgundian juice in every vein Wakes high-flushed riot's noisy strain; And if a man of sober trim Differs from his politic whim; Before the grave-one can be heard, He quickly takes him by the beard; Nought his unshackled fancy awes; He damns the king, and blasts the laws. Look into Swift's immortal page, And tremble at thy party rage; See how he writes in Freedom's cause, Freedom supported by the laws; Freedom against bad monarchs brave, That calls the second Charles a knave, The second James a gloomy fool; Yet still lets Truth her judgment rule; And oft reflects, with gushing eye, How Charles the first was doomed to die. Yes, Swift, if thou hadst not as yet To nature paid the general debt, And could I dare to be so great As to encounter some high fate; Withstand corruption, risk my blood, And perish for my country's good; Nothing would rid me more of fear, And animate my high career; Make me with tenfold ardour glow, Than, most august of men, to know, That, when I had resigned my breath, Thy virtuous praise would crown my death. As probably the Power Divine With pleasure views such worth as thine, The generous tribute thou hast payed To virtuous Charles's injured shade, May with the Deity atone For insults on his memory thrown; Even for his horrid murder may Wipe half the nation's guilt away. Swift, great calumniated name! The priesthood's glory, and it's shame! Thy destiny I may produce To serve my present moral use. No churchman's heart with too much heat For a proud bishop's throne should beat; Since so deserving, so renowned, Thou wast not with the mitre crowned. And if a wretch of human line Can touch thee in the seats divine, Accept, O Charles, a poet's lays, Who sometimes pants for honest praise; But would not be to please the times, Guilty of prostituted rhymes; Nor odium on the memory fling Of an unhappy martyred king. And yet my liberal, British muse Harbours no high-church, kingly views; Laughs at the dotage of the wight Who broached a monarch's heavenly right; And if a base, though sceptered hand, Strives to oppress a generous land; By sycophants, and royal pride, From rectitude is drawn aside; May hear complaints on every tongue, Yet still redoubles public wrong; Never begins the wholesome task, In lonely hour himself to ask— Have not I some way hurt the state, That thus I feel the public hate? Goes on in his opposing strain; As if to harrass were to reign. If such a wretch in any land Is vested with supreme command— My muse pronounces him a mule, Disqualified for sovereign rule; A magistrate through empire's lust, Perfidious to a sacred trust. Dear critick, yet my hasty pen A little while indulge, and then I'll bring my lecture to a close, And you to phlegmatick repose. Say, are the men whom genius warms, Purely triumphant in its charms? Ah no! the organs wrought so fine, The sensibility divine, That rouse the animated strain, Let in a world of moral pain. Once more view Swift—his parts decay; The mighty genius falls away: Long have his studies been at strife With Nature's finer springs of life; Ideas ardent, and refined, Have in a ferment kept his mind: Strong passions, which, howe'er suppressed, Will sometimes fire the generous breast; Inmates of greatness ever born, His health by slow degrees have worn. Some wanderings too from Virtue's plan, For Swift, though god-like, was a man; His feeling heart would oft corrode, And render life a galling load. There mute the awful changeling sits! Tremble ye poets, patriots, wits! See talents in their living tomb; Yet once how brightly did they bloom! And are thy soul's effusions o'er? Yes; Reason holds her lamp no more; Save that sometimes, with glimmering light, She gives thy misery to thy sight. Kind death approaches; now 'tis done; Swift's vital course at length is run; Swift, now exempt from mortal woe, Leaves all the pain he felt below; From his old house in ruin flies, And wings, aërial, to the skies. How many accidents combine To blast the poet's bold design, Who thinks to purchase, with his lays, A crown of never fading bays! Even Milton's energy of soul Fanatick jargon could controul; And though his deathless work is fraught With vast sublimity of thought, The trumpery of a cold divine Incumbers, oft, his epic line. Thy times, great poet, could not see What eulogy was due to thee, Where thy divine invention reigns, And transport listens to thy strains. Thy genius, in those barbarous days, Could not be fed with England's praise— Thou sleepest in the grave; thine ear Cannot thy country's raptures hear, Which now by taste, and judgment ruled, Amidst thy dross admires thy gold. Butler pursued a different way; The shining meteor of a day: His work describes the frantick times; And brightest wit adorns his rhymes: Such poets ever must engage The warm attention of their age: But he, so read, and quoted once, Is almost levelled with the dunce Here I was doing his memory great injustice. 1810.: His verses known to Charles by rote, Who gave him not a single groat, Of civil rage a picture give Too circumstantially to live; His party's warmth, long since, is o'er: We battle with his wit no more. Ye, who the world external scorn, On wings of speculation born To the ideal vast profound; What is your knowledge?—a vain sound. Racking the mind with fruitless pain, You form your unsubstantial chain: Your links infallibly advance, Till in the metaphysick trance, Your reason, through her serious play, Reasons the reasoner's self away. Fallacious life! thy soothing schemes In general prove but gilded dreams! Men to the grave continue boys, Enamoured still with trivial joys. In quest of emptiness we go; Bubbles our pleasure 'tis to blow; And eager after them we run, Superbly painted by the sun: They burst, and vanish into air; Straight other bubbles we prepare. But be it ever mine the views At present cherished by the muse, In memory to retain, and bring My conduct to the notes I sing. Let me a little circle draw Around me, marked by Virtue's law; And never let, with visit rude, Within the sacred line intrude, Of fancied wants the numerous train, Those fiends, inflicting moral pain. Let me my simple plan pursue, All luxury bursting on my view, As steadily as when I talk With Virtue in retirement's walk; As when the rural shady bower Imbrowns the philosophick hour. While spirit-stirring exercise, While modest temperance health supplies; Still let my short, but ardent prayer, Give thanks to heaven's paternal care: Bread let me eat, and water drink, With grateful pleasure, while I think That Philip's riches may command The luxury of sea and land; But when the miscreant takes his seat, His stomach's palled, he cannot eat; For he looks up, and sees despair Hang trembling by a single hair. And if (too sanguine thought!) my strains Should e'er reward their poet's pains; Be reckoned worthy to inspire Britannia's sons with virtuous fire; Let neither minister, nor king, Dictate to me how I shall sing: But let me, if the times demand For freedom's sake a hardy stand, Rather embrace a Wilkes's fate, As brave as he, though not so great; For publick good, not publick breath, Encounter exile, chains, or death. London, June 25th, 1769. THE END.</field>
