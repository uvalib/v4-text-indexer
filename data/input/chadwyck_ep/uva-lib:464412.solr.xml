      <field name="fulltext">To the Right Honourable THE LORD Marqvesse Hamilton, Master of the Horse to his Maiestie, Iames Hamillton: Anagramma, I Amm All Honesty. Of words, 'tis vaine to vse a Multitude, Your very Name all Goodnesse doth include. TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, THE Lord Steward of his Maiesties Honourable Hovsehold William Herbert Earle Of Penbroke Anagramma. Liberaly Meeke, For Repvte Honovrable. What can be more then is explained here T' expresse a worthy well deseruing Peere TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, THE LORD Chamberlaine of his Maiesties most Honourable Hovsehold, PHILIP HERBERT EARLE OFF MONTGOMERY Anagramma, Firme Faith Begot All My Proper Honer. Firme faith begot mine honor (sayes my name) And my firme faith shall ever keepe the same. TO THE MOST HIGH, MOST MIGHTY, AND MOST ANCIENT PRODVCER, SEDVCER, AND ABVSER OF MANKIND, THE WORLD. Errata, or Faults to the Reader. Faults, but not faults escap'd, I would they were, If they were faults escap'd, they were not here: But heere they are, in many a page and line, Men may perceiue the Printers faults, or mine. And since my faults are heere in prison fast, And on record (in print) are like to last, Since the Correcters let them passe the Presse, And my occasions mix'd with sicknesses, And that foure Printers dwelling farre asunder, Did print this booke, pray make the faults no wonder. I will confesse my faults are scap'd indeed, If they escape mens Censure when they read. No Garden is so cleare, but weedes are in't, All is not Gold that's coined in the Mint; The Rose hath prickles, and the spots of sinne, Oft takes the fairest features for their Inne. Below the Moone no full perfection is, And alwaies some of vs are all amisse. Then in your reading mend each mis-plac'd letter, And by your iudgement make bad words sound better. Where you may hurt, heale; where you can afflict, There helpe and cure, or else be not too strict. Looke through your fingers, wink, conniue at mee, And (as you meet with faults) see, and not see. Thus must my faults escape, (or escape neuer,) For which, good Readers, I am yours for euer. Iohn Taylor. In laudem Authoris. Thou hast no learning, yet with learned skill Thou dost write well, although thy meanes be ill. And if I could, I would thy merits raise, And crowne thy temples with immortall Bayes. Thine in the best of friendship, Abraham Viell. To the Author, Iohn Taylor. Wast euer keowne to any time before, That so much skill in Poesie could be, Th'attendant to a Skull, or painefull oare? Thou liu'st in water, but the fire in thee; That mounting Element, that made thee chuse, To court Vrania, the diuinest Muse. Row on: to watermen did neuer blow A gale so good, none so much goodnesse know. Thomas Brewer. To my worthy and well-deseruing friend, our wel-known hydropoet, Iohn Taylor. Some till their throats ake cry alowd and hollo To aucupate great fauors from Apollo. One Bacchus and some other Venus vrges, To blesse their brain-brats. Those cœrulean surges, Gyrdling the earth, emball thy nerues, and season Those animall parts, quiek Organs of mans reason. This Nimph-adored fountaine farre excells, Aganipe Aon; all that Bubulkes wells. These daunst about thy Quinbro-boate to kisse thee, And often since roare out because they misse thee. These wyned with loue-sicke Thame the banks o'rswel To visit their ingenious darlings Cell. Blue Neptunes salt tempred with Thames sweet water, Make thee both tart and pleasing. What theater Of late; could Cinthius, halfe staru'd mists perswade T' applaud; nay not to hisse at what they made? Then call on Neptune still; let Delos sinke Or swimme; for thee let Phœbus looke, or winke VVhilst his poore Priests grow mad with ill successe: That still the more they write they please the lesse. Thine Amphitritean Muse growes more arrident, And Phœbus tripos, stoopes to Neptunes trident. R. H. To his friend the Author. In sport I hitherto haue told thy same, But now thy Muse doth merit greater Name. Soares high to Heau'n, from earth and water flies, And leauing baser matters, mounts the skies. Where hidden knowledge, she doth sweetly sing, Carelesse of each inferiour common thing. Oh that my Soule could follow her in this, To shun fowle sin, and seeke eternall blisse! Her strength growes great, and may God euer send, Me to amend my faults, as she doth mend. Robert Branthwaite. To my honest friend, Iohn Taylor. What shall I say, kind Friend, to let thee know How worthily I doe this worke esteeme? Whereof I thinke I cannot too much deeme, From which I find a world of wit doth flow. The poore vnpollisht praise I can bestow Vpon this well deseruing worke of thine, Which heere I freely offer at thy Shrine, Is like a Taper, when the Sunne doth showe, Or bellowes helpe for Eol's breath to blow: For thou as much hast soard beyond the straine, Whereto our common Muses doe attaine: As Cintyhaes light exceeds the wormes that glow. And were my Muse reple at with learned phrase, The world should know thy work deserueth praise. Thine in the best of friendship, Richard Leigh. To the deseruing author, Iohn Taylor. It is disputed much among the wise, If that there be a water in the skyes: If there be one: no Water-man before, Was euer knowne to row in't with his Oare. If none; such is thy high surmounting pen, It soares aboue the straine of Watermen: Whether there be or no, seeke farre and neere, Th'art matchlesse sure in this our hemispheere. William Branthwaite Cant. To my friend Iohn Taylor. Row on (good Water-man) and looke back still, (Thus as thou dost) vpon the Muses Hill, To guide thee in thy course: Thy Boate's a sphære Where thine Vrania moues diuinely-cleare. Well hast thou pli'd and (with thy learned Oare) Cut through a Riner, to a nobler shore, Then euer any landed-at. Thy saile, (Made all of clowdes) swels with a prosp'rous gale. Some say, there is a Ferriman of Hell, The Ferriman of Heau'n, I now know well, And that's thy selfe, transporting soules to Blisse. Vrania sits at Helme and Pilot is; For Thames, thou hast the lactea via found, Be thou with baies (as that with stars is) crownd. Thomas Dekker. [These Bookes in number sixty three are heere] These Bookes in number sixty three are heere, Bound in one Volume, scattred here and there, They stand not thus in order in the booke; But any man may finde them, that will looke. Taylors VRANIA. To the Vnderstander. See here the Pride and Knowledge of a Sayler, His Sprit-saile, Fore-saile, Main-saile, &amp; his Mizzen; A poore fraile man, God wot, I know none frailer: I know for Sinners, Christ is dead, and rizen. I know no greater sinner then Iohn Taylor, Of all, his Death did Ransome out of Prizzen, And therefore here's my Pride, if it be Pride, To know Christ, and to know him Crucifide. 1 Eternall God, which in thine armes do'st Graspe All past, all present, and all future things: And in ineuitable doome dost claspe The liues and deaths of all that dyes and springs, And at the doomefull day will once vnhaspe Th'accusing booke of Subiects and of Kings. In whom though ending nor beginning be, Let me (O Lord) beginne and end in thee. 2 All cogitations vaine from me remooue, And cleanse my earthly and polluted heart: Inspire me with thy blessings from aboue, That (to thy honour) I with Artlesse Art May sing thy Iustice, Mercy, and thy Loue; Possesse me with thy Grace in euery part, That no prophane word issue from my pen, But to the Glory of thy name; Amen. 3 I doe beseech thee, gracious louing Father, Reiect me not in thy sharpe judging Ire: But in thy multitude of Mercies Rather Recall me to thee, Recollect me Nigher, My wandring Soule into thy bosome Gather, And with thy Grace my gracelesse heart Inspire, Dictate vnto my mind what it may thinke, Write with thy Spirit what I may write with ink. 4 Thou all things wast eu'n then when nothing was, And then, thou all things did'st of nothing make: Of nothing All thou still hast brought to passe, And all againe, to nothing must betake. When sea shall burne, and land shall melt like brasse, When hills shall tremble, and the mountaines quake, And when the World to Chaos turnes againe, Then thou Almighty All, shalt All remaine. 5 And since this vniuersall massie ball This earth, this aire, this water, and this fire, Must to a ruine and a period fall, And all againe to nothing must retire: Be thou to me my onely All in All, Whose loue and mercy neuer shall expire. In thee I place my treasure and my trust, Where Fellon cannot steale, or canker rust. 6 All things (but only God) at first began, The vncreated God did all Create: In him Alone is equall will and can, Who hath no ending, or commencing date. To whose Eternitie all time's a span Who was, is, shalbe, euer in one state. All else to nothing hourely doth decline, And onely stands vpon support Diuine. 7 Our high Creator our first Parents form'd, And did inspire them with his heau'nly spirit: Our Soules-seducer (Satan) them deform'd, And from Gods fauour did them disinherit: Our blest Redeemer them againe reform'd, And ransom'd them by his vnbounded merit. Thus were they form'd, deform'd. reform'd againe By God, by Satan, and our Sauiours paine. 8 Mans Generation did from God proceed A mortall Body, and a Soule Eternall: Degeneration was the Deuils deed, With false delusions and with lies infernall: Regeneration was our Sauiours meede, Whose death did satisfie the wrath supernall. Thus was man found, and lost, and lost was found By Grace; with Glory euer to be crownd. 9 Man was produc'de, seduced, and reduc'de By God, by Satan, and by God agen: From good to ill, from ill he was excusd'e By merit of th'Immortall Man of men. The vnpolluted bloud from him was sluc'de, To saue vs from damnations dreadfull den. Thus man was made, and marde, and better made, By Him who did sinne, death, and hell inuade. 10 Let man consider then but what he is, And contemplate on what erst he hath bin: How first he was created heire of blisse, And how he fell to be the Child of sinne; How (of himselfe) he hourely doth amisse, And how his best workes doe no merit winne, Except acceptance make them be esteem'd, Through his obedience that our Soules redeem'd. 11 Before thou wast, remember thou wast nought, And out of nought (or nothing) thou wast fram'de: And how thy Body being made and wrought By God, was with a liuing Soule inflam'de: And how th'Eternall Nomenclator taught Thee name all Creatures that were euer nam'de, And made thee Stuard of the worlds whole treasure And plac'de thee in a Paradise of pleasure. 12 Then wast thou Viceroy to the King of heau'n, And great Lieutenant to the Lord of hosts: The rule of all things vnto thee was giu'n, At thy command all creatures seru'd like posts To come or goe, and at thy becke were driu'n Both neere and farre, vnto the farthest coasts. God all things made, as seruants vnto thee Because thou only shouldst his seruant be. 13 He gaue life vnto hearbes, to plants, and trees, For if they wanted life, how could they grow? A beast hath life and sence, moues, feeles, and sees, And in some sort doth good and euill know: But man's before all Creatures in degrees: God life, and sence, and reason did bestow And left those blessings should be transitory, He gaue him life, sence, reason, grace, and glory. 14 Then let our meditations scope be most, How at the first we were created good: And how we (wilfull) grace and goodnes lost And of the sonnes of God, were Satans brood. Then thinke the price, that our Redemption cost Th'eternall Sonne of Gods most precious blood. Remember this whilst life and sence remaine, Else life, and sence, and reason are in vaine. 15 Thou to requite thy God that all thee gaue, Ingratefully against him didst rebell: Whereby from Regall state, thou turnedst slaue, And heau'nly Iustice doom'd thee downe to hell. As thy rebellion from thy God thee draue, So 'gainst thee all things to rebellion fell. For when to heau'n thy due obedience ceast, Thy disobedience taught each brutish beast. 16 Now see thy miserable wretched state, Thou and the earth is eke with thee accurst: All worldly things, which thee obaide of late, In stiffe commotion now against thee burst: And thee for euer droue from Eden gate, To liue an exilde wretch, and which is worst, Thy soule, (Gods darling) fell from her preferm?t, To be the Deuils thrall, in endlesse torment. 17 But Mercies sea hath quenched Iustice fire, And Heau'ns high heire (in pitty of mans case) In person came, and satisfide Gods ire, And gracelesse man new Repossest in Grace. The Sonne of God came downe, to raise vs higher, To make vs Glorious, he himselfe made base. To draw vs vp, downe vnto earth he came, And honor'd vs, by putting on our shame. 18 Who can conceiue the Glory he was in Aboue the heau'ns of heau'ns, inthroan'd in blisse? Who can conceiue the losse that he did winne To rectifie and answer our amisse? Who can conceiue the Mountaines of our sinne, That must be hid with such a sea as this? No heart, no tongue, no pen of mortall wight These things can once conceiue, or speake, or write. 19 Man may collect th'abundance of his vice, And the deare loue his God to him did beare, In thinking on th'inestimable price Was paid his sinne-polluted soule to cleare, To giue him an immortall Paradise, And to redeeme his foes, to pay so deare. For if our sinnes had not beene more then much, The ransome of them sure had not beene such. 20 The blood of any mighty mortall King Was insufficient this great debt to pay: Arch-angels power, or Angels could not bring A Ransome worth forbearance but a day; The onely Sonne of God must doe this thing, Else it must be vndone, and we for aye. God was the Creditor, and man the debter, Christ (God &amp; man) did pay, none could pay better. 21 Then since thy sinfull Soule from Grace was lost, And since by Grace it hath found Grace againe: Since being lost, so great a price is lost, T'enfranchise it from euerlasting paine, And since thy crimes are quit, thy debts are crost, Thy peace with God, the way to heau'n made plain. Let not all this in vaine for thee be done, But thankfull be to God, through Christ his Sonne. 22 Forget not thou art ashes, earth, and dust, And that from whence thou cam'st, thou shalt again: And at the last Trumpe that appeare thou must, When Procseys and Essoynes are all in vaine: Where iust and vniust, shall haue iudgement iust, For euer doomb'd to endlesse ioy, or paine. Where though that thou bee damn'd, it is Gods glory, Thy wife, thy sonne, thy fire, will not be sorry. 23 Me thinks it should make man this world to lothe When that which will a thousand cloath and feede: It should but onely one man feede and clothe In fares excesse, and gorgeousnesse of weede: Yet this braue canker, this consuming moth (Who in his life ne'r meanes to doe good deede) Must be ador'd for those good parts he wants, By fearefull Fooles, and flattering Sicophants. 24 Hath he the title of an earthly grace? Or hath he Honor, Lordship, Worship? or Hath he in Court some great commanding place? Or hath he wealth to be regarded for? If with these honors, vertue he embrace, Then loue him; else his puckfoist pompe abhorre “Sun-shine on dung-hils makes them stinke the more, “And Honor shewes all that was hid before. 25 Shall men giue reu'rence to a painted trunke That's nothing but all outside, and within Their senses are with blacke damnation drunke, Whose heart is Satans Tap-house, or his Inne: Whose Reputation inwardly is sunke, Though outwardly raisd vp, and swolne with sin, I thinke it worse then to adore the Deuill, To worship his base Instruments of euill. 26 No, looke vpon the Man, and not his Case, See how he doth his Maker imitate: If Grace supernall, giue internall Grace, That makes his minde on vertue contemplate, That holds this world, and all things in't as base, Knowes death makes happy, or vnfortunate. That doth no wrong, for fauour, gaine, or feare, And layes on each, that each deseru's to beare. 27 Such men (no doubt) but few such liuing are, For they are thickly sow'd, and thinly grow'd, The purest Wheat is mixed with the Tare, The humble mindes, are seruile to the proud. Uice Reuels, and poore Vertue's poore and bare, Hypocrisie into the Church will crowd. So man must more then humane wit possesse, T'escape the baites and snares of wickednesse. 28 The Atheist of the Scriptures can dispute, That one would deeme him a Religious man: The Temporizer to the Time will sute, Although his Zeale be Machiuillian. Then there's a Faith that seldome yeelds good fruit, And though impure, is call'd a Puritan. A thousand Sects in thousand Protean shapes Are Times true Turne-coates, and Religions Apes. 29 The greatest plague, that euer came from Hell, Is to be puft and stuft with selfe-conceit: When men too Ill, esteeme themselues too well, When ouer-valued worth proues light in weight, When Selfe-loue and Ambition makes vs swell Aboue the limits of Discretions height. When the poore Iay displays his borrowed plumes; And man (vnfeeling sin) to sinne presumes. 30 But if thy feathred pride, Icarian-high Doth soare too farre aboue true Reasons bownd: Th'eternall Sunne thy waxen wings will frie, Thy fatall Fall, thy Folly shall confound. Who (like that Cretan) mounts ambitiously, In Seas of sorrow shall (like him) be drownd. By pride the Caldean Monarchie decreast, A King (the best of men) was made a Beast. 31 The state of Man may be compared well Vnto a Kingdome gouern'd well or ill: For if his Rule and Policie excell, His Reason (like a Queene) commands his will. But if seditious Passions doe rebell, They Reasons Court with all disorder fill, And ouer-run her carelesse Common-wealth, With murder, fraud, oppression, whoredome, stealth. 32 The Sences are this Kingdomes Court of Guarde, To keepe their Queene secure from terrene treason: Great is the trust and safetie of this Ward, Whilst they giue true Intelligence to Reason: But if this Guarde their duties not regard, And mis-informe their Queene at any season; Then right for wrong, and wrong for right sheele conster, And in her Apprehension proues a Monster. 33 The Hearing, Sight, the Taste, the Smell and Touch, If Vices doe present themselues for obiects: And they (incredulous) not deeme them such, Informing Reason that they are good Subiects; If Reasons iudgement be not more then much, She entertaines for Worthies these base Abiects: Who spoyle her Court, and breake her Kingdomes frame, And turne her State and Glory into shame. 34 The Appetite, the Fancie, and the Will, (Spirituall Faculties) are Reasons Peeres: Who (of themselues) doe counsell all things ill, Not knowing what is true, but what appeares: If she attend, what onely they instill, She takes in meere delusions through her eares: And they at last will thrust her from her Throne, And then (vsurping Rebels) sit thereon. 35 These Vassals hauing got the Regall sway, Inforce the Comwons which are the Affections, Their hatefull hellish precepts to obey, With promise of their fauours and protections: Th'Affections all agree, and all doe pay These Miscreants their tributes and subiections, And now is Reason banisht, and they threat, She ne're shall gaine againe her awfull seat. 36 Th'vsurping Heart, sometimes doth raigne as King, Sometimes the Braine is Counseller of State: The Eyes and Eares, Intelligence doe bring, The Tongue (as Herald) tydings doth relate. The Hands and Feet doe execute each thing, Which these intruding Tyrants loue or hate. And euery Member plaies a painfull part, To serue a swimming Braine, and swelling Heart. 37 The Fancy (like an Ape) skips to, and fro, Begins a thousand things, and endeth none: Makes, marrs, forbids, and bids, no, yea, yea, no, Doe, and vndoe, hold fast, and let alone: Run, stay, vp, downe, stand, fall, goe, come, come, goe, Sad, glad, mad, wittie, foolish, mirth and moue. Thus Fancie doth in Apish toyes delight To serue the greedy maw of appetite. 38 And Appetite (as doth a big-womb'd Dame) Lusts, longs, desires, and must haue this and that: Hearbs, roots, fruits, flowres, Fish, Fowle, Beasts wilde and tame She must &amp; wil haue, wel she knows not what: Whilst Fancy, and Imagination frame Themselues more nimbly then a mouzing Cat, Still searching what the Appetite desires, Superfluous meats, drinks, bables, and attires. 39 The Memory's Lord Keeper of the Treasure, And great Recorder of this world of dust: The Vnderstanding giues true Iustice measure To Good, to Bad, to Iust, and to Uniust; Inuention and Remembrance waite the leasure Of Memorie; and Understanding must Haue Wisedome for her fellow, and her guide, Else Prince, and Peeres, and Commons stray aside. 40 Truth, and false Lying, on the Tongue attends; The one instructs her plainely in the Troath, The other's proper, and improper, ends Doth reach to lye, and vouch it with an oath: The Tongue loues one of these, yet both contends, But she wants entertainment for them both. At last she takes in Lying for her Page, And bids Truth walke a beggers Pilgrimage. 41 When VVisedome must giue Follie cap and knee, When hare-braind Will, o're Wit doth rule &amp; raigne. When Lying, shall make Truth regardles be, When Loue is payde with hatred and disdaine: When Sense and Appetite doe all agree To serue a false rebellious heart and braine; When they haue Reasons Court, thus vnderminde, It is a signe that Vnderstanding's blinde. 42 Then is the place where Vertue doth abode, Made a foule Rendeuouz for filthy Vice: The Temple of the holy Spirit of God Esteemes his blessed presence of no price. Man spurnes against his iust reuenging Rod Worse then the Iewes, that for his Coat cast Dice. Men falne into a reprobated Sence, Dread not their Makers great Omnipotence. 43 Then what art thou, polluted earthly clod, Thou span, thou froth, thou bubble, and thou smoke: Worse then the dust, that vnder-foot is trod, Dar'st thou thy Makers furie to prouoke? Why wilt thou (wilfull) thy perdition plod, And with damnation thy saluation choke? Christ bought thy Soule, and lent it thee to vse it, 'Tis none of thine; and therefore not abuse it. 44 Dar'st thou prophane with thy vngodly breath His name, that did (before the world) elect thee? Dar'st thou dare him his Iustice sword t'vnsheath? Dar'st thou prouoke his mercy to reiect thee? Dar'st thou run headloug to perpetuall death, Whereas eternall torments shall correct thee? And dar'st thou (wretched worme) of earthly race, Belch blasphemy against thy Makers Grace? 45 He thou offendest is the King of Kings, Heau'n, Earth and Hell, doe tremble at his frowne: Bright Angells and Archangells alwayes sings Before the seat of his immortall Crowne: His foes to fell confusion downe he flings, He giues his seruants Honour and Renowne. His power's not circumscribed here, or there But all in all, is all, and euery-where. 46 Can nothing moue thy flinty heart to Ruthe, That of thy selfe thou some remorse wouldst take; And not to spend thy beauty, strength, and youth, To serue the Sou'raigne of the Stygian Lake? Say not, to morrow, thou wilt seeke the truth, And when sin leaues thee, thou wilt sinne forsake. When thou no more (through weaknes) canst offend, Then lame, old, rotten, thou wilt God attend. 47 When hoary haire, and blood all frozen chill, When eyes waxe dim, and limbs are weake &amp; lame: And that no more thy rash rebellious will Cannot performe vile deeds of sinne and shame: When thou hast lost thy strength to doe more ill, Then vnto Heau'n, thy minde thou 'ginst to frame. Thy youth in Satans seruice being spent, In age thou think'st on God, and dost repent. 48 Supppose a man that's much ingag'd to thee, Hath a good Horse, which thou dost much desire: Thou offrest for him thrice his worth, to be The Master of this Beast thou dost require: But this ingratefull wretch will not agree To giue, to sell him thee, or let thee hire, But lets him (all his youth) be rid by those Who are thy spightfull, and thy mortall foes: 49 And when hee's leaue, and old, and lame, and blind Gall'd, foundred, filthy, wanting no disease: Botts, Glaunders, Spauin, broke in the winde, Not a tooth left to mumpe on beanes and pease: Then this Companion, (most vnkindly kinde) Will let thee haue this Palfray, if thou please, If now (past good) thou scornest to receiue him, Heele flay his skin off, &amp; the dogs shall haue him. 50 Betwixt thy God and thee, such is the case: When thou art young, strong, sound of winde and lim, Thy soule aud body shuns his heau'nly Grace, Thou wilt not serue thy God, nor waite on him: But (heedlesse) headlong run'st a hellish race, Till age hath brought thee to the graues hard brim: Then (being clog'd with sin, diseas'd and foule) Thou offrest God thy body and thy soule. 51 But dost thou thinke he is at thy command, Or that his mercy must attend thy leasure? Or dost thou thinke thou canst in iudgement stand And scape the iustice of his high displeasure? Or dost thou thinke that his Almighty hand Is shortned? or that his supernall pleasure Regards not how the Sonnes of Men doe liue? Or that without Repentance hee'le forgiue? 52 Sly Satans Rage is almost at an end, And well he knowes his domination's short, He therefore now doth all his Engins bend To batter and confound our fleshly Fort; He and his Ministers doe all attend To draw vs to his damn'd infernall Court. For if he lose our soules at latest cast, Twill be too late when all his power is past. 53 And therefore now he plots his diuellish drifts, To separate vs from our God so louing: In making vs vnthankefull for his gifts, And by our heynous sins his Anger mouing, Whilst wings of Faith our prayers vpwards lifts To praise our Maker (as is best behouing) Then Satan kills our Zeale, and vnawares We are intangled in vile worldly snares. 54 God made enough, all men to satisfie, Yet not enough to giue one Man content: For he that had the worlds whole soueraigntie, Would couet for a further continent. Ambitious thirst of fading Dignitie (As though they were for euer permanent) Doth banish Loue, and euery heau'nly Motion, Blinds all our Zeale, and murders our Deuotion. 55 Tis truely writ in many a thousand story, And thousand thousand sheets of blotted paper Declares how terrene things are transitory, Incertaine certaine, wasting like a Taper. How frothy painted Pompe, and greedy Glory When least we thinke, doth vanish like a vaper. Experience teacheth this, and truth bewraies it, And various humane accidents displaies it. 56 To day great Diues in a purple coate, With Epicurian Appetite doth feed: His cups with Wine doe ouerflow and floate, His baggs with quoyne, his heart from feare is freed, And on the world, and wealth doth only dote, (As if his death, his life should not succeed.) He loues himselfe, himselfe loues him agen, And liu's a hated wretch, of God and Men. 57 Nor stone, or dropsie, or the groaning Gowt Can make him with his wealth to liue in hate, He (maugre paine) takes pleasure to finde out New Proiects to increase his too great state; To marry much to much, he casts about, And neuer dreames of his expiring date, Vntill he heare the fatall bell to towle, And Hell stand gaping to deuoure his Soule. 58 I'haue heard of an extortionizing Curr, That hath beene numbd and sencelesse, as a logg; Who neither limbe, or leg, or ioynt could sturr, But on his death-bed grunting like a Hog: And almost speechlesse with his rattling Murr, Yet care of Coyne his conscience did so clogg, That not a thought of Heau'n he could afford, But ten i'the hundred was his latest word. 59 Thus Gold that should be captiue vnto all, Doth captiuate his Keeper, as a slaue: Who like an Idoll doth before it fall, And neuer meanes another God to haue. And when Heau'ns Pursiuant, grim-Death, doth call To warne him to his vn-a-vcyded Graue, Vntill his Iawes be cram'd, and ram'd with mold, Hee'le speake or (speechles) make a signe for gold. 60 We ought no formed Creature to adore, Or frame will-worship in our idle braine: Nor of the Angells must we ought implore, For Man and Angells helpe is all but vaine; Yet pur-blind Auarice still gapes for more, And makes his Mammonitish God his gaine: He playes the Bawd, his money is the Whore, whilst it breeds Bastards, he doth hold the doore. 61 He thinks his life Angelicall, because Amongst the Angells he doth spend his time: And Royall he will be, for in his pawes The Royalls are insnarde like birds in lime: And with his Nobles he ordeineth lawes, That base extortion shall not be a crime. He marks how Kingdomes, Prouinces, and Townes, Are ouer-ruled by his cursed Crownes. 62 But if he note his Angells, what they be; Not heau'nly, nor yet those from Heau'n that fell: But they are in a third, and worse degree Dumb damned sencelesse ministers of Hell. They cannot smell, or feele, taste, heare, or see, And thousand times be'ng told, yet cannot tell, Th'ar lock'd, and barr'd, and bolted vp in thrall, Which shewes their Nature not Angelicall. 63 His Royalls doth not Royallize himselfe, Or make him better then he is, or was, In spight of all his ill got canker'd Pelfe, Hee's but a miserable golden Asse: The Deuills deare darling, a most hatefull Elfe, Which as Hells Factor on the Earth doth passe. Were euery haire about him made a Royall, He were a Wreath, to God and Men disloyall. 64 His Nobles no way doth enoble him, Their Counsell cannot mend his Rascall minde: His heart's obdurate, and his eyes are dim To thinke or see, t'ward good to be inclinde. Hee'le venter soule and body, life and lim To scrape and scratch what he must leaue behinde. His Nobles thus, ignobly make him liue, And headlong to the Deuill, their Master, driue. 65 Amongst his Marks he neuer marketh how He spends, or lends, or giues, his ill got store: He marks to make it multiply and grow, And for the vse of Fiftie takes a score. He neuer dreads Heau'ns dreadfull angry browe, But daily grinds the faces of the poore. Let vengeance thunder, and let Hels dog barke, Amongst his Marks, of Grace he hath no marke. 66 And though a world of Crownes are in his hand, For euery Crowne might he a Kingdome haue, His state no better (in my minde) should stand Then a rich Begger, or a kingly Slaue. He should his Crownes, and they not him command, They (Vassall-like) should do what he should craue. Lo thus the Crownes their Soueraigne ouerswayes, They rule and Raigne, he like a Slaue obeyes. 67 Thus Angels to a Caitiffe, are a curse, His Royalls makes his baseues farre more base: His Nobles, his ignoble minde make worse; His Marks, are marks and figures of disgrace: His Crownes vsurpeth in his Niggard purse, And in his heart Contentment hath no place. For Angels, Royalls, Marks and Crownes Can put no vertue, in the minds of Clownes. 68 The onely slaue of slaues, is Moneyes slaue, He pines in plenty, starn's amidst his store: Dies liuing, and doth liue as in a Graue, In wealthy-want, and in abundance poore: The Goods he hath, he badly doth depraue, And only cares how he may purchase more. For he himselfe cannot afford himselfe A good meales meat, for wasting of his pelfe. 69 His feare's his wealth, his torment his delight, His Conscience foule, affrightfull is his sleepe: His hope despaire, his mirth in sadnes dight, His ioyes are Cares, what he hath got to keepe: His Rest, is restles vnrest day and night, And in a Sea of Melancholy deepe, Amidst his large possessions liu's in lack, And dies in debt to's belly and his back. 70 Me thinkes I heare a Miser-Churle obiect, None railes at Wealth, but those which liue in want: The idle Grashopper cannot affect The toylesome labours of the frugall Ant: The Prodigall by no meanes will be checkt So much as when his Purses lining's scant. The Fox doth scorne the Grapes, but wot you why? Because out of his reach, they hang too high. 71 So doth a sort of poore and needy Hyndes, The scum and dregs, of euery Common wealth: The shak-rag-shag-haird crue, whose boundles minds Must be supplide with shifting, or by stealth. Like sick men, when their paines their Reason blinds They enuy all men that are well in health. So doth a swarme of Drones, and idle mates Reuile and enuie at our happy states. 72 But let them storme, and raile, and curse, and sweare, Within our coffers, we will keepe the Gold: Let them themselues, themselues in pieces teare, What we haue got with toyle, with care we'le hold. What is't doth men to reputation reare, But when their goods &amp; wealth growes manifold, We care not then, let needy Rascalls raile Till Tyburne eat them, or some lothsome I ayle. 73 Thus doth a Wretch his thirst of Gaine excuse, And makes his bad trade good with show of thrift: Himselfe, (continuall) with himselfe doth muse Vpon some purchase, or some gaining drift; And as a Hog, his downeward lookes doe vse To poare, and not aloft his eyes to lift. He takes Heau'ns fruit, &amp; hoordeth vp the same, And ne're remembers God, from whence it came. 74 But fill thy baggs, till they are ouer-filld, And empt thy conscience more, (if more thou can) Raise higher rents, and let thy Land be till'd, And tell thy selfe thou art a happy man. Pull downe thy Barnes, and boasting bigger build. As if thy blessed state were new began. Then comes a voyce, with horror and affright, Thou foole, Ile fetch away thy soule this night. 75 And tell me then, who shall these Goods possesse That thou hast damn'd thy selfe to purchase them? Who shall be heire to all thy vaine excesse, For which thy soule, that deare (too deare) bought Iem, In hazard is, of endlesse wretchednesse Be'ing banisht from the new Ierusalem. The goods are Ill, that doth the world controule, Whose cursed gaine, doth lose the Owners soule. 76 What's in the world should make men wish to liue, If men could well consider what it is: What in the world that happinesse can giue, Which is not drownd in sorrowes blacke Abiss? What goods in the world can a man atchieue, But woe and misery, o'rewhelmes his blisse? No pleasures, or contentments stedfast are: For all we can call Ours, is onely Care. 77 I'haue seene a Gallant, mounted all in gold Like Alexander, on Bucephalus: The ground (in his conceit) too base to hold Him, whom the smiles of Fortune fauours thus. But in his height of heat, how soone hee's cold, By death, snatch'd from his pompe, himselfe, &amp; vs! His Name, and Noble-Mushrom-fame forgot, And all things (but his shame) must lye and rot. 78 The beauteous Lady, that appeares a Saint, Of Angells forme, and Heau'n admired hue: That can (by Art) defectiue Nature paint, And make false colours to the eye seeme true: Yet Death at last, her brau'ry doth attaint, And (spight her Art) she must pay Natures due. The rarest features, and the fairest formes Must dye and rot, and be consum'd with wormes. 79 Wealth, Beauty, as they are abusde or vsde, They make the Owners either curst or blest: As Good or Ill is in the minde infusde, They adde a ioyfull rest, or woes vnrest: To vse them well th'are blest, but if abusde, Thy God doth thee &amp; them loath and detest: And turnes his blessings, which should most c?tent thee, To dreadfull cursings, which shal stil torment thee. 80 Seeke then Heau'ns Kingdome, and things that are right, And all things else shall be vpon thee cast: Thy dayes of Ioy shall neuer turne to night, Thy blessed state shall euerlasting last. Liue still, as euer in thy Makers sight, And let Repentance purge thy vices past. Remember thou must drink of deaths sharpe cup, And of thy Stewardship account giue vp. 81 Had'st thou the beauty of faire Absolon, Or did thy strength the strength of Sampson passe: Or could thy wisedome match wise Salomon, Or might thy riches Cressus wealth surpasse; Or were thy pompe beyond great Babylon, (The proudest Monarchy that euer was,) Yet Beauty, Wisedome, Riches, Strength, and State, Age, Death, and Time, will spoile and ruinate. 82 Make of the World, no more then as it is, A vale of Cares, of miseries, and woes: Thinke of it, as the sinke of all amisse, That blinds our Sences with deceiuing showes: Account it as a den of balefull blisse, The which (vnthought of) all estates o'rethrowes, How Satan in it beares a Lordly sway, And how none but his subiects it obey. 83 And whilst thou runn'st this transitory race, Vse well the blessings God to thee hath sent: Doe Good with them whilst thou hast time &amp; space, And know they are but things vnto thee lent. Know that thou must appeare before Gods face, To answer if they well, or ill be spent. If thou hast spent them well, then heau'n is thine, If ill, th'art damn'd to hell, by doome Diuine. 84 But ten times happy shall that Steward be, Which at the last the Lord shall faithfull finde: Heart, tongue or eyes, cannot thinke, speake, or see The glory that to him shall be assignde. He shall out-passe the Angells in degree, He shall out-shine all Starres that euer shinde. He shall for euer, and for euer sing Eternall prayses to his God and King. 85 Vnto which God the Father, first and last, Whose goodnes, all conseru's, preseru's, and feeds: To God the Sonne, whose merits downe hath cast Sinne, death, and hell, (due vnto sinners meeds.) To thee O Holy Ghost, that euer wast The blessing that from Sire, and Sonne proceeds: And to the vn-deuided Three in One, All Power, and Praise, and Glory be alone. FINIS. [THE SEIGE AND SACKING OF Iervsalem.] TO THE TRVELY VVORTHY, AND RIGHT HONOVRABLE Iohn Moray, L VISCOVNT Annan, EARLE OF Annandale, one of the Gentlemen of his Maiesties Royall Bed-chamber; Earths Honours, and Heauens happinesse. This Booke, (Good Sir) the issue of my braine, Though farre vnworthy of your worthy view, Yet I in duty offer it to you, In hope you Gently it will entertaine. And though the Method and the Phrase be plaine, Not Artlike writ, as to the stile is due, Yet is it voyde of any thing vntrue; And truth, I know, your fauour shall obtaine. The many fauours I from you haue had, Hath forc'd me thus to shew my thankefull minde: And of all faults, I know no vice so bad And hatefull, as ingratefully inclinde. A thankefull Heart, is all a poore mans pelfe, Which, (with this Booke) I giue your Worthy Selfe Your Worships, euer most obliged, Iohn Taylor. THE SEVERALL SIEGES, ASSAVLTS, SACKINGS, AND FINALL DESTRVCTION OF the Famous, Ancient, and memorable Citty of Iervsalem. The Iustice, Mercy, and the Might I sing Of heau'ns iust, mercifull, Almighty King. By whose fore-knowledge all things were elected, Whose power hath all things made, &amp; al protected, Whose Mercies flood hath quencht his Iustice flame, Who was, is, shall be One, and still the same. Who in the Prime, when all things first began, Made all for Man, and for himselfe made Man. Made, not begotten, or of humane birth, No Sire but God, no Mother but the Earth; Who ne'r knew Childhood, or the sucking teate, But at the first was made a man compleat. Whose inward Soule, in God-like forme did shine As Image of the Maiestie Diuine. Whose supernaturall wisedome, (beyond Nature) Did name each sensible, and sencelesse creature, And from whose Star-like, Sand-like Generation, Sprung euery Kindred, Kingdome, Tribe, and Nation All people then, one language spake alone, Interpreters the world then needed none: There liued then no learned deepe Grammarians, There were no Turkes, no Scythians, no Tartarians. Then all was one, and one was onely all The language of the vniuersall Ball. Then if a Traueller had gone as farre As from the Artick to th'Antartick starre, If he from Boreas vnto Auster went, Or from the Orient to th'Occident, Which way soeuer he did turne or winde, He had beene sure his Country-man to find. One hundred, thirty winters since the Flood, The Earth one onely language vnderstood: Vntill the sonne of Gush, the sonne of Cham, A proud cloud-scaling Towre began to frame, Trusting that if the world againe were drown'd, He in his lofty building might rest sound; All future Floods, he purposd to preuent, Aspiring to Heau'ns glorious Battlement. But high Iehouah, with a puff was able To make ambitious Babel but a bable. (For what is man, that he should dare resist The great Almighties pow'r, who in his fist Doth gripe Eternity, and when he please Can make, and vnmake, Heau'n, and Earth, &amp; Seas?) For in their expectation of conclusion, He plag'd them all with sundry Tongues confusion. Such Gibrish Gibble Gabble all did iangle, Some laugh, some fret, all prate, all diffring wrangle; One calls in Hebrew to his working Mate, And he in Welch Glough whee Comrage doth prate. Another gapes in English, or in Scotch, And they are answer'd in the French or Dutch, Caldaicke, Syriacke, and Arabian, Greeke, Latine, Tuscan, and Armenian, The Transiluanian, and Hungarian, The Persian, and the rude Barbarian; All these, and diuers more then I can number, Misunderstanding tongues did there incumber. Thus he that sits in Heau'n their plots derided, And in their height of pride, their tongues deuided. For in this sudden vnexpected change, The wife and husband, Sire and sonne were strange, The Brother could not vnderstand the Brother, The Daughter stands amazed at her Mother, By euery one a seuerall part is acted, And each vnto the other seemes distracted. Thus by the iustice of the Lord of Hasts Each seuerall tongue was driu'n to seuerall coasts, And God (peculiar) to himselfe did chuse His most beloued, yet hard-hearted Iewes. Iehouahs honor with them then did dwell, His name was onely knowne in Israel, Salem his habitation was of yore, In Sion men his Glory did adore. Th'Eternall Trine, and Trine Eternall One In Iury then was called on alone, The sonnes of Heber, were the adopted stocke, Gods onely Chosen, holy sacred Flocke, Amongst all Nations, them he onely lik'd, And for his owne vse, them he culd and pik'd; Them his sin-killing, sauing word he gaue T'instruct them, what condemn'd, and what would saue To them he gaue his word, his Couenants band, His Patriarks, his Prophets, and his hand Did blesse, defend, instruct, correct, and guide The Iewes, and no one Nation else beside. For them, a world of wonders hath he done, To them, he sent his best begotten Sonne, On them, a Land he freely did bestow, Where milke and hony plentiously did flow, With them he was, till they from him did turne, And wilfully against his blessings spurne; All heau'nly, earthly Soules, or Bodies good They lack'd no temp'rall, or eternall food. His Temple builded in Ierusalem, Where he had daily sacrifice from them, Where though their seruice was defect and lame Th'Almighties mercy did accept the same. (For though Mans sin is great, God hath decreed To take his best endeuour for a deed.) And whilst they in his loue and feare abode, They were his people, he their gracious God. But when impieties began to breed And ouergrow old Iacobs sacred seed, When they from good to bad began to fall, From ill to worse, from worst, to worst of all, When Gods great mercies could not them allure, And his sharp threatnings could not them procure, When each ones body was vnto the soule A lothsome Dungeon, to a prisoner foule. When sin (al shamelesse) the whole Land o'rspreads, Then God threw dreadful vengeance on their heads: And for their heynous heaping sin on sin, Ierusalem hath oft assaulted bin. First, Shishak, Egypts King, with might and maine Made hauock there, in Rehoboams Raigne; The Citty, Temple, Golden vessels, Shields, All (as a prey) to the Egyptians yeelds. Next Ioas came, the King of Israel, In Amaziahs dayes with fury fell; He brought Iudea to Samariaes thrall, King, Kingdome, Princes, Peeres, and people all. Then thirdly, Rezin King of Aram came In Abaz time, with sword and furious flame. Th'Assyrian great Zenach'rib was the next, By whom good Hezekiah was perplext. But when blasphemous Pagans, (puft with pride) Contemptuously the God of gods defide, The Lord of Lords (whom no pow'r can withstand) Tooke his owne gracious, glorious cause in hand, He vs'd no humane Arme, or speare, or sword, But with his All-commanding mighty Word, One Angell sent to grisly Plutoes den, A hundred, eighty, and fiue thousand men. Then fiftly was Ierusalem subdude, In Iudaes blood, th'Assyrians hands imbrude, Manasses godlesse Glory did expire, All yeeld vnto th'insulting foes desire; Vsurping Conquest all did seaze vpon, The King in chaines-bound, sent to Babylon, Till he (repenting) to his God did call, Who heard his cry, and freed him out of thrall. Then sixtly, Pharaoh-Necho Egypts King, To great distresse all Iudaes Land did bring, With fell confusion all the Kingdome fill'd, And (with a Dart) good King Iosias kill'd. The Shepheard, for his wandring sheep was strook; The godly Prince, from godlesse people tooke; So this iust, zealous, and religious Prince, (Whose like scarce euer Raign'd before, or since) Th'Almighty (to himselfe) did take agen, As knowing him too good for such bad men. Nabuchadnezer, next made them obey, When Zedekiah did the Scepter sway: King, Kingdome, Peeres, and people, all o'rethrown, All topsie-turuy, spoyld, and tumbled downe: The curst Caldeans did the King surprize, Then slew his Sons, and next pluck'd out his eyes: Then vnto Babylon he was conuayde, In Chaines, in Priso, and in Darknesse layde, Till death his Corps, did from his soule deuide, He liu'd a slaue, and sadly, gladly dyde. The Citty, and the Temple burnt and spoyld, With all pollution euery place was soyld; The holy vessels all away were borne, The sacred Garments which the Priests had worne, All these the Caldees, (voyde of all remorce) Did cary vnto Babylon perforce. Which, seuenty yeeres, in slauery and much woe They kept, and would by no meanes let them goe, Till Persian Cyrus did Earths glory gaine, Who freed the Iewes, and sent them home againe: He rendred backe their vessels and their store, And bad them build their Temple vp once more. Which many yeeres in glorious state did stand, Till Ptolomy the King of Egypts band Surpriz'd the Iewes, and made them all obey, Assaulting them vpon the Sabbath day. Next after that, from Rome great Pompey came, And Iudaes force, by force, perforce did tame: Then did the Cæsars beare the earthly sway, The vniuersall world did them obey And after that, the Romane pow'r did place The Idumean Herods gracelesse Grace, Him they created Tetrarch (demy King) 'Gainst whom the Iewes did boldly spurne and fling, For they had sworne that none but Dauids seed In the seat Royall euer should succeed. But Sossius, and King Herods Armies strength Did ouer-run them all in breadth and length, By hostile Armes they did them all prouoke, To beare the burthen of their awfull yoke. And lastly, when the Romanes ouer-run By valiant Titus, old Vespasians sonne; Then fell they to an vnrecouer'd wane, They all in generall, were or slaine or tane, Then was the extirpation of them all, Their iust, worst, last, most fatall, finall fall. Thus mercy (being mock'd) pluckd iudgm?t down, Gods fauour being scorn'd, prouokes his frowne; Aboue all Nations he did them respect, Below all Nations he did them deiect; Most vnto them his fauour was addicted, Most vpon them his fury was inflicted; Most neere, most deare, they were to him in loue, And farthest off his wrath did them remoue; He blest, he curst, he gaue, and then he tooke As they his Word obeyde, or else forsooke. How oft Iehouah seem'd his sword to draw To make them feare his precepts and his Law, How oft he raisd them, when they hedlong fell, How oft he pardond, when they did rebell, How long did Mercy shine, and Iustice winke, When their foule crimes before Gods face did stinke! How oft Repentance, like a pleasing sauour, Repurchasd Gods abused gracious fauour! When he did blessings vpon blessings heape, Then they (ingratefull) held them meane and cheape, Their plenty made them too too much secure, They their Creators yoke would not endure. They (gracelesse) fell from goodnesse &amp; from grace, And kick'd and spurn'd at Heau'ns most glorious face. The Prophets, and the Seers that were sent To warne them to amendment, &amp; repent, They ston'd, they kill'd, they scorn'd, they beat, they bound, Their goodnesse to requite, their spight did wound. The Prophets came with loue, and purchas'd hate, They offred peace, and were return'd debate; They came to saue, and were vniustly spill'd, They brought them life, and were vnkindly kill'd, No better entertainment they afford Vnto the Legates of their louing Lord. Thus were the Lab'rers in Gods Vineyard vsde, Thus was their loue, their care, their paines abusde; Their toyles and trauailes had no more regard, Bonds, death, and tortures, was their best reward. At last th'Almighty from his glorious seat Perceiu'd his seruants they so ill intreat, No more would send a Prophet or a Seer, But his owne Sonne, which he esteem'd most deare. He left his high Tribunall, and downe came, And for all Glory, enterchang'd all shame, All mortall miseries he vnderwent To cause his loued-louelesse Iewes repent; By Signes, by Wonders, and by Miracles, By Preaching, Parables, and Oracles, He wrought, &amp; sought, their faithlesse faith to cure. But euer they obdurate did endure. Our blest Redeemer came vnto his owne, And 'mongst them neither was receiu'd or knowne, He whom of all they should haue welcom'd best, They scorn'd and hated more then all the rest. The God of principalities and pow'rs, A Sea of endlesse, boundlesse mercy, showres Vpon the heads of these vnthankefull men, Who pay loue, hate; and good with ill agen. Their murdrous-minded-malice neuer left, Till they the Lord of life, of life bereft; No tongue, or pen, can speake, or write the story Of the surpassing high immortall glory, Which he (in pitty and in loue) forsooke, When he on him our fraile weake nature tooke. To saue Mans soule, his most esteemed Iem, And bring it to the new Ierusalem, From Greatest great, to least of least he fell For his belouee chosen Israel. But they more mad then madnesse, in behauiour, Laid cursed hands vpon our blessed Sauiour. They kill'd th'ternall Sonne and Heire of Heau'n, By whom, and from whom, all our liues are giu'n, For which the great Almighty did refuse, Disperse, and quite forsake the faithlesse Iewes; And in his Iustice great omnipotence He left them to a reprobated sence. Thus sundry times these people fell and rose, From weale to want, from height of ioyes to woes: As they their gracious God forsooke, or tooke, His mercy either tooke them, or forsooke. The swart Egyptians, and the Isralites, And raging Rezin King of Aramites, Then the Assyrians twice, and then againe Th'Egyptians ouer-run them all amaine; Then the Caldeans, and once more there came Egyptian Ptolomy, who them o'recame. Then Pompey, next King Herod, last of all, Vespasian was their vniuersall fall. As in Assyria Monarchy began, They lost it to the warlike Persian, Of Nimrods Race, a Race of Kings descended, Till in Astiages his stocke was ended; For Cyrus vnto Persia did translate Th'Assyrian Soueraigne Monarchizing state. Then after many bloody bruzing Armes The Persian yeelded to the Greekes Alarm's, But (smoake-like) Grecian glory lasted not, Before 'twas ripe, it did vntimely rot. The worlds Commander, Alexander dyde, And his Successors did the world deuide; From one great Monarch, in a moment springs Confusion (Hydra-like) from selfe-made Kings, Till they (all wearied) slaughter'd and forlorne, Had all the earth dismembred, rent and torne; The Romanes tooke aduantage of their fall, And ouer-ran, captiu'de, and conquerd all. Thus as one nayse another out doth driue, The Persians the Assyrians did depriue; The Græcians then the Persian pride did tame, The Romanes then the Græcians ouercame, Whilst like a vapor all the world was tost, And Kingdomes wer transferd from coast to coast; And still the Iewes in scattred multitudes Deliuer'd were to sundry seruitudes, Chang'd, giuen, bought, &amp; sold, from land to land, Where they not vnderstood, nor vnderstand. To euery Monarchy they were mad slaues, Egypt and Aram, Caldea them out-braues; Assyria, Persia, Græcia; lastly Rome Inuaded them, by heauens iust angry doome. Foure Ages did the sonnes of Heber passe, Before their finall desolation was; Their first Age, aged Patriarks did guide, The second reuerend Iudges did decide, The third by Kings, naught, good, bad, worse, and worst, The fourth by Prophets, who them blest or curst, As their dread God commanded, or forbid To blesse, or curse, eu'n so the Prophets did. Our Sauiour, weeping on the Mount did view The Citty, and foretold what should ensue; And in his tender pitty vnto them Said, Oh Iervsalem, Iervsalem, Thou kill'st the Prophets, and to death didst ding Those that were sent, thee heau'nly grace to bring, How oft, and oft, would I (for your owne good) Haue gathered you, as doth a Hen her brood! But you would not: and therefore to you all Your houses shall to desolation fall. Which came to passe, according as he said, Which in the second part is here displaide. THE LAST AND MOST LAMENTABLE Destruction of the Ancient, Famous, and Memorable Citty and Temple of Iervsalem; being destroyed by Vespasian, and his Sonne Titvs. Confusion, Horror, Terror, dreadfull Wars, Domesticke, forraigne, inward, outward Iars, Shafts shot at Iuda in Iehouahs ire, Infectious plague, war, famine, sword, and fire, Depopulation, desolation, and The fiuall conquest of old Iacobs Land. These are the Theames my mournfull Muse rehearses, These are the grounds of my lamenting Verses. Iosephus wrote these things in ample wise, Which I thus briefly doe Epitomize: Which worthy Author in large scope relates His Countries alterations, and estates. The Bookes of his Antiquities doe tell, How oftentimes th'arse, how oft they fell, How oft God fauour'd them, how oft his frowne From height of greatnes cast them headlong down, The Seuenth booke of his Warres declareth plaine, How Roman Conquest did the Kingdome gaine, How death did tyrannize in sundry shapes, In sword, in fire, in famine, and in Rapes. Who loues to reade at large, let him reade his, Who likes compendious briefes, let him read this. Since Hebers sonnes the Country first enioyde, Sixe times it hath beene wasted and destroyde, Twice three times spoyld, and thirteen times in all, Wars force, or Composition made it thrall, Compare all wars, that chanc'd since the Creation, They all are nothing to their desolation; No story, or no memory describes Calamity to match old Isr'els Tribes: For if each Land the bloody broyles recount, (To them) 'twere but a mole-hill to a Mount: All which (for sin) in the Almighties fury Was heap'd vpon the sinfull Land of Iury: And almost sixteene hundred winters since Did great Uespasian, Romes Imperiall Prince, With braue young Titus, his stout valiant son, Iudeaes Kingdome spoyle and ouer-run. And with an Army Royall, and renound, They did Ierusalem beleaguer round. With force, with stratagems, with warlike powers, With Rams, with Engines, scaling ladders, Towres, With all the Art of either might or sleight, The Romanes vpon each aduantage wait. Whil'st the besieged, that within did dwell, Amongst themselues to fell sedition fell; “Like neigh'bring bauins, lying neere each other, “One burnes, and burning each one burne another; So did the Iewes each other madly kill, And all the streets with their slayne corpses fill. Eleazer, Simon, Iohn, all disagree And rend Ierusalem in pieces three. These each contending who should be the chiefe, (More then the Romans) caus'd their Co?tries griefe. Iohn scorn'd Eleazer should be his superior, And Eleazer thought Iohn his inferior; And Simon scornd them both, and each did scorne By any to be rul'd, or ouer-borne; The Citty sundred thus in triple factions, Most horrid, bloody, and inhumane actions Were still committed, all impieties, (In sundry sorts of vile varieties) All sacrilegious and vngodly acts Were counted Noble meritorious facts. They striu'd each other to surpasse in euill, And labor'd most, most how to serue the Deuill. These men, of grace and goodnesse had no thought, But daily, madly 'gainst each other fought. They hurly burly all things ouerturn'd, Their store-houses with victuals down they burn'd, With hearts more hard then Adamantine rocks, They drailed Uirgins by the Amber locks; The Reuerend Aged they did rend and teare About the streets by snowie ancient haire; Yong Infants, some their harmlesse braines dash out, And some on points of Launces borne about, That 'tis not possible to write with pen, The barb'rous outrage of these deuillish men: For they (vnmindfull of the Romane force) Themselues did waste &amp; spoyle without remorce. Their cruel slaughters made their furious foes Relent and weepe, in pitty of their woes, Whil'st they (relentlesse Villaines) voyde of pitty Consume, and ruinate their Mother-Citty. The Channels all with purple gore o'r-flowde, The streetes with murdred carkasses were strowde: The Temple with vnhallowed hand defilde, Respect was none, to age, sexe, man, or childe; Thus this three-headed, hellish multitude Did waste themselues, themselues themselues subdude, Whil'st they within still made their strength more weak, The Roman Rams th'opposed walls did break: Whose dreadfull battry, made the Citty tremble, At which the Factious all their powers assemble, And all together (like goods friends) vnite And 'gainst their foes they sally forth and fight. “Like a swolne Riuer, bounded in with banks “Opposed long, with Pike-like Reedy Ranks, “At last th'ambitious torrent breaks his bounds, “And ouer-runs whole Lordships, and confounds “The liuing and the liuelesse, that dares bide “The fury of his high-insulting pride. Euen so the Iewes from out the Citty venter'd, And like a flood the Romane Army enter'd, O'rwhelming in their desp'rate madnesse all That durst withstand them, or assault the wall. They set the fearefull Engines all on fire, And brauely fighting made their foes retire; The battell done, back came these hare-braind men, And each the others foe deuide agen. Pell mell confusion, then againe began, All order straight vnto disorder ran; Their corne and victuals, all consum'd with fire, Their hunger-starued bodies 'gin to tire, Prouision in a moment, spoyld and wasted, Which kept (might well) for many yeeres haue lasted. Then Famine, like a Tyrant roames and rages, Makes faint (yet furious) hauock of all ages, The rich, the poore, the old, the young, all dyes, All staru'd, and fleshlesse bare Anatomies, This was a plague of plagues, a woe of woes, On euery side their death did them inclose, But yet the manner how to lose their breaths, Did more torment them then an host of deaths. To sally forth, the Romanes shed their blood, To stay within, they starue for want of food, And if they would goe forth, the gates were shut, And if they staid within, their throats were cut: That if they stay, or goe, or goe, or stay, Th'are sure to meet destruction euery way; But of all torments, hunger is the worst, For through the stony walls (they say) 'twill burst; These people with warre, woe, and want, beset, Did striue how they might to the Romanes get, They hopde to finde more mercy in their swords, Then their still-dying famisht state affords. Mans wit is sharpest when he is opprest, And wisedome (amongst euils) likes the least. They knew Vespasian for a Noble foe, And one that did not glory in their woe, They thought it best his clemency to try, And not immurde with hungry famine dye. Resolued thus (dispairing in their hopes) A number slyding downe the walls with ropes, Fled vnto Tytus, who bemoand their case, Relieuing them, and tooke them to his Grace. Thus forty thousand neere with famine staru'd, Were all vnhop'd for, by their foes preseru'd The Cittie Soldiers search'd each house to see Where any victuals might conuayed be, And if they any found, they thought it fit To beat the owners for concealing it. But if they saw a man looke plumpe and fat, His throat they presently would cut for that, They thought him too much pamperd too well fed, And to saue meat and drinke, they strike him dead. Some men and women, Rich and Nobly borne, Graue all they had for one poore strike of corne, And hid themselues and it below the ground, In some close vault they eat the same vn-ground. If any could get flesh, they eat it raw, The stronger still, the weakest ouer-awe, For hunger banisht naturall respect, It made the husband his owne wife reiect, The wife doth snatch the meat from out his hand Which would and should hir loue and life c?mand. All pitty from the Mother was exilde She teares and takes the victuals from her Childe, The Childe doth with the Parents play the thiefe, Steales all their food, and lets them pine in griefe. Nor Free or Bond-man, Fathers, nor yet Mothers, Wiues, Husbands, seruants, masters, sisters, brothers, Propinquitie or strong Affinitie, Nor all the rights of Consanguinitie, No Law, or Rule, or Reason could beare sway, Where strength c?mands, there weaknes must obey. The pining seruant will no master know, The son his father will no duty show, The Commons did no Magistrate regard, Each one for one, and but for one he carde, Disordred, like the cart before the horse, All reu'rence and respect did yeeld to force. These Miscreants with vigilance all watch'd Where they could see a doore, or lock'd or latch'd, There they supposd the people were at meat, And in their outrage ope the doores they beat, Where entring, if they found them feeding fast, From out their throats they teare the meat in haste, Halfe eaten, halfe vneaten, they constraine The wretched people cast it vp againe. They halde them by the eares the house about, To force them bring supposed victuals out; Some by the thumbs hang'd vp, some by the toes, Some prick'd with bodkins, some with many blows Tormented were, to force them to reueale Meat, when they had not any to conceale. Now all was fish that fell into the net, And all was food that fraud or force could get; Grasse, hay, barke, leaues of trees, and Dogs, and Cats. Toads, frogs, wormes, snailes, flies, maggots, mice and rats, All silthy stinking and contagious rootes, The couer of their Coaches, shooes, and bootes, All vermine, and the dung of fowles and beasts, Were these poore wretches miserable feasts; Things loathsome to be nam'd in time of plenty, Amongst the staru'd distressed Iewes were dainty. This famine ran beyond all Natures bounds, All motherly affection it confounds, No blood or birth, with it compassion won, It forc'd a Woman kill her onely Son, She rip'd him and dis-ioynted lim from lim, She drest, she boyld, she broyld, and rosted him, She eat him, she inter'd him in her wombe, She made his births place his vntimely tombe. From her (by Nature) did his life proceed, On him (vnnaturall) she her selfe did feed, He was her flesh, her sinews, bones and blood, She (eating him) herselfe, herselfe made food. No woe her miserie can equallize, No griefe can match her sad calamities, The Soldiers smelt the meat and straight assemble, Which wh? they saw (with horror) made th? tr?ble Each one with staring haire, and ghastly looke, Affrighted, and amaz'd, the house forsooke This horride action, quickly ouercame These men, whom force of man could neuer tame. Thou that dost liue like to a fatted Brawne, And cramst thy guts as long as thou canst yawne, Thou that dost eat and drinke away thy time, Accounting Gluttony a God, no Crime, Thou must haue Fowle as high as heau'n that pearc'd And hast the bowels of the Ocean search'd, And from all places neere so farre remote, Hast dainties for thy all-deuouring throat, Whose pamperd paunch ne'r leaues to feed &amp; quaff, Till it be made a Hogs trogh, fill'd with draff. Thinke on Ierusalem amidst thy Riot, Perhaps 'twill moue thee to a temp'rate diet. And you braue Dames, adorn'd with Iems, &amp; Iewels, That must haue Cawdles, Cullisses and Grewels, Conseru's and Marchpanes, made in sundry shapes, As Castles, Towres, Horses, Beares and Apes, You, whom no Cherries like your lickrish tooth, But they must be a Pound a pound forsooth, Thinke on Ierusalem amidst you glory, And then you'le be lesse dainty, and more sorry. What there auaild their beauty, strength, or riches, (Three things which all the spacious world bewitches) Authoritie and Honor help'd them not, Wrong trod downe Right, and Iustice was forgot, Their greatest, chiefest, only earthly good Was (twas no matter how they got it) Food. One little piece of bread they reckond more Then erst they did of bags of Gold before, One scrap, which full fed corps away doe fling, With them, had bin a ransom for a Kin. The lothsome garbadge which our Dogs refuse Had bin a dish of state amongst the Iewes. Whilst Famine playd the Tyrant thus within, The Romane Army striu'd the walls to win, Their Enginers, their Pioners and all Did mine and batter, and assault the wall. Ierusalem had three strong walls of stone, And long 'twas ere the Romans could get one, The dearth and death of sword and famine spred The streets, that liuing trod vpon the dead, And many great mens houses full were fill'd With carkases, which the seditious kill'd: That with the stench of bodies putrifide, A number numberles of people dyde. And buriall to the dead they yeelded not, But where they fell, they let them stinke and rot, That plague, and sword, and famine, all three stroue Which should most bodies fr? their soules remoue. Vnsensible of one anothers woes, The Soldiers then the liueles corpses throwes By hundreds and by thousands o're the walls, Which when the Romans saw their dismall falls They told to Titus, which when he perceiu'd He wept, and vp t'ward heau'n his hands he heau'd, And calld on God to witnes with him this, These slaughters were no thought, or fault of his. Those wretches that could scape from out the City, Amongst their foes found both reliefe and pity. If the seditious any catch that fled, Without remorse they straitway strook him dead. Another misery I must vnfold, A many Iewes had swallow'd store of gold, Which they supposd should help them in their need But from this treasure did their bane proceed. For being by their en'mies fed and cherisht, The gold was cause that many of them perisht; Amongst them all, one poore vnhappy creature Went priuatly to doe the needs of Nature, And in his Ordure for the Gold did looke, Where being by the straggling soldiers tooke, They ript him vp and searcht his maw, to finde What Gold or Treasure there remain'd behind. In this sort, (whilst the soldiers gap'd for gaine) Was many a man and woman ript and slaine. In some they found gold, and in many none, For had they gold, or not gold, all was one, They were vnboweld by the barb'rous foe. And search'd if they had any gold or no. But now my Story briefly to conclude, Uespasians forces had the walls subdude, And his triumphant Banner was displaide Amidst the streets, which made the Iewes dismaid, Who (desp'rate) to the Temple did retire, Which (with vngodly hands) they set on fire, Whilst Noble Titus, with exceeding care Entreated them they would their Temple spare, Oh saue that house (quoth he) ò quench, oh slake, And I will spare you for that Houses sake, Oh let not after-times report a Storie That you haue burnt the worlds vnmatched glory, For your owne sakes, your children, and your wiues If you doe looke for pardon for your liues. If you expect grace from Uespasians hand, Then saue your Temple Titus doth command. The Iewes with hearts hard, offred mercy heard, But neither mercy, or themselues regard, They burnd, and in their madnes did confound King Salomons great Temple to the ground. That Temple which did thirty millions cost, Was in a moment all consum'd and lost, The blest Sanctum Sanctorum, holiest place Blest oft with high Iehouahs sacred Grace, Where (at one offring) as the Text sayes plaine, Were two and twenty thousand Oxen slaine, One hundred twenty thousand Sheepe beside At the same time for an oblation dide. That house of God (which raignes aboue the thunder) Whose glorious fame made all the world to w?der, Was burnt and ransackt, spight of humane aide, And leuell with the lowly ground was laid. Which when Uespasian and young Titus saw, They cride kill, kill, vse speed and marshall Lavv; The Roman soldiers then (inspirde with rage) Spard none, slew all, respect no sex or age; The streets were drowned in a purple flood, And slaughterd carcasses did swim in blood. They slew, whilst there were any left to slay, The ablest men, for slaues they bare away. Iohn, Simon and Eleazer, wicked fiends, As they deseru'd, were brought to violent ends. And from the time the Romanes did begin The siege, vntill they did the Citty win, Sedition, sword, fire, famine, all depriues Eleuen hundred thousand, of their liues. Besides one hundred thousand at the least Were tane, and sold, as each had beene a beast. And from the time it was at first erected Till (by the Remanes it was last deiected) It stood (as it in histories appeares) Twenty one hundred, seuenty and nine yeeres. But yet ere God his vengeance downe did throw, What strange prodigious wonders did he show, As warnings how they should destruction shun And cause them to repent for deeds misdon; First the Firmament, Th'offended Lord Shewd them a Comet like a fiery sword, The Temple and the Altar diuers nights Were all enuiron'd with bright burning lights, And in the middest of the Temple there Vnnat'rally a Cow a Lambe did beare, The Temples brazen gate, no bolts restraine, But (of it selfe) it open flew amaine. Arm'd Men and Chariots in the Ayre assembled, The pondrous Earth, affrighted, quak'd, &amp; trembled, A voyce cride in the Temple, to this sence, Let vs depart, let vs depart from hence. These supernat'rall accidents, in summe Foretold some fearefull iudgement was to come: But yet the Iewes accounted them as toyes, Or scarcrow bugg-beares to fright wanton boyes, Secure they reuell'd in Ierusalem, They thought these signes against their foes, not them. But yet when warre and death had all perform'd, When ruine, spoyle, &amp; furious flames had storm'd, Who then the desolated place had seene, Would not haue knowne there had a Citty beene. Thus Iuda and Ierusalem all fell, Thus was fulfill'd what Christ did once foretell, Sad desolation, all their ioyes bereft, And one stone on another was not left. FINIS.

Being lately in Antwerpe, it was my fortune to ouerlooke an old printed booke in prose, which I haue turned into verse, of the life, death, and buriall of our blessed Lady: wherein I read many things worthy of obseruation, and many things friuolous and impertinent; out of which I haue (like a Bee) suckt the sacred honey of the best authorities of Scriptures, and Fathers which I best credited, and I haue left the poyson of Antichristianisme to those where I found it, (whose stomackes can better digest it) I haue put it to the Presse, presuming it shall be accepted of Pious Protestants, and charitable Catholikes: as for luke-warme Nutralists, that are neither hot nor cold, they doe offend my appetite, and therefore vp with them. The Schismaticall Separatist, I haue many times discourst with him, and though hee be but a Botcher, or a Button-maker, and at the most a lumpe of opinionated ignorance, yet he will seeme to wring the Scriptures to his opinions, and presume to know more of the mysteries of Religion, then any of our reuerend learned Bishops and Doctors. I know this worke will be vnrelished in the pestiferous pallats of the dogmaticall Amsterdammatists, but I doe, must, and will acknowledge a most reuerend honour and regard vnto the sacred memory of this blessed Virgin Lady, Mother of our Lord and Redeemer Iesvs; and in my thoughts she shall euer haue superlatiue respect aboue all Angels, Principalities, Patriarkes, Prophets, Apostles, Euangelists, or Saints whatsoeuer, vnder the blessed Trinity; yet (mistake me not, as there is a difference betwixt the immortall Creator, and a mortall creature, so (whilst I haue warrant sufficient from God himselfe, to inuocate his name onely) I will not giue Man, Saint, or Angell, any honour that may bee derogatory to his Eternall Maiestie. As amongst women she was blest aboue all, being aboue all, full of Grace, so amongst Saints, I beleeue she is supreme in Glory: and it is an infallible truth, that as the Romanists doe dishonour her much, by their superstitious honourable seeming attributes; so on the other part, it is hellish and odious to God and good men, either to forget her, or (which is worse) ro remember her with impure thoughts, or vnbeseeming speech for the excellency of so Diuine a Creature. I confesse my selfe the meanest of men, and most vnworthy of all to write of her, that was the best of Women: but my hope is, that Charity will couer my faults, and accept of my good meaning, especially hauing endeuoured and striuen to doe my best: So wishing all hearts to giue this holy Virgin such houour as may be pleasing to God, which is, that all should patterne their liues, to her liues example, in lowlinesse and humility, and then they shall be exalted, where she is in Glory with eternity. Iohn Taylor. Before the fire, ayre, water, earth were fram'd, Sunne, Moone, or any thing vnnam'd, or nam'd, God was, who ne'r shal end, nor ne'r began, To whom all ages and all time's a span: By whose appointment each thing fades or growes, And whose eternall knowledge all things knowes. When Adams sinne pluck'd downe supernall Ire, And Iustice iudg'd him to infernall fire: The Mercy did the execution stay, And the great price of mans great debt did pay. And as a Woman tempted Man to vice, For which they both were thrust from Paradise: So from a woman was a Sauiours birth, That purchas'd Man a Heauen for losse of earth: Our blest Redeemers Mother, that blest Shee, Before the World by God ordain'd to be A chosen vessell fittest of all other, To be the Sonne of Gods most gracious Mother: She is the Theame that doth my Muse inuite, Vnworthy of such worthinesse to write. I will no prayers nor inuocations frame, For intercession to this heau'nly Dame, Nor to her name one fruitlesse word shall runne, To be my Mediatresse to her Sonne, But to th'eternall Trinity alone, Ile sing, Ile sigh, Ile inuocate and mone. I prize no creatures glory at that rate, The great Creators praise t'extenuate. But to th'Almighty, (ancient of all dayes,) Be all dominion, honour, laud, and praise. I write the blest conception, birth, and life, Of this beloued Mother, Virgin, Wife: The ioyes, the griefes, the death, and buriall place Of her, most glorious, gracious, full of grace. Her Father Ioachim, a vertuous man, Had long liu'd childlesse with his wife S. Anne, And both of them did zealously intend, If God did euer Sonne or Daughter send, That they to him would dedicate it solely To be his seruant, and to liue most holy: God heard, and granted freely their request, And gaue them Mary (of that sex the best.) At three yeeres age, she to the Temple went, And there eleu'n yeeres in deuotion spent: At th'end of fourteene yeeres it came to passe, This Virgin vnto Ioseph spoused was. Then after foure months time was past and gone, Th'Almighty sent from his tribunall throne His great Ambassador, which did vnfold The great'st ambassage euer yet was told. Haile Mary full of heau'nly grace (quoth he) The (high omnipotent) Lord is with thee: Blest amongst women (by Gods gracious doome) And blessed be the fruit of thy blest wombe. The Angels presence and the words he said, This sacred vndefiled Maid dismaid, Amazed, musing what this message meant, And wherefore God this messenger had sent: Feare not (said Gabriel) Mary most renown'd, Thou with thy gracious God hast fauour found; For lo, thou shalt conceiue and beare a Sonne, By whom redemption and saluation's wonne: And thou his sauing Name shalt IESVS call, Because hee'll come to saue his people all. She humbly, mildly, heau'ns high Nuncius heares: But yet to be resolu'd of doubts and feares, How can these things (quoth she) accomplisht be, When no man hath knowledge had with me? The Holy Ghost (the Angell then replide) Shall come vpon thee, and thy God and guide, The power of the most High shall shadow thee, That Holy thing that of thee borne shall be, Shall truely called be the Sonne of God. By whom Sinne, Death, and Hell, shall downe be trod. Then Mary to these speeches did accord, And said, Behold the hand-Maid of the Lord, Beat to me according to thy will. I am thine owne obedient seruant still. This being said, she turn'd her Angell tongue, My Soule doth magnifie the Lord, (she sung) My spirit, and all my faculties, and voyce, In God my Sauiour solely doth reioyce: For though mans sinnes prouoke his grieuous wrath, His humble hand-maid he remembred hath. For now behold from this time henceforth shall All generations me right blessed call: He that is mighty me hath magnifide, And holy is his name: his mercies bide On them that feare him (to prouoke his rage) Throughout the spacious world from age to age. With his strong arme he hath shew'd strength, and batterd The proud, and their imaginations scatterd. He hath put downe the mighty from their seat, The meeke and humble he exalted great: To fill the hungry he is prouident, When as the rich away are empty sent: His mercies promis'd Abr'am and his seed, He hath remembred, and holpe Israels need. This Song she sung with heart and holy spright. To laud her Makers mercy and his might: And the like Song sung with so sweet a straine Was neuer, nor shall e'r be sung againe. When Mary by the Angels speech perceiu'd, How old Elizabeth a child conceiu'd, To see her straight her pious minde was bent, And to Ierusalem in three dayes she went. And as the Virgin (come from Nazareth) Talk't with her kinswoman Elizabeth, Iohn Baptist, then vnnam'd, an vnborne boy, Did in his Mothers belly leape with ioy: Both Christ and Iohn vnborne, yet Iohn knew there His great Redeemer and his God was neere. When Ioseph his pure wife with child espide, And knew he neuer her accompanide, His heart was sad, he knew not what to say, But in suspect would put her quite away. Then from the high Almighty Lord supreme, An Angell came to Ioseph in a Dreame, And said, Feare not with Mary to abide, For that which in her blest wombe doth recide, Is by the Holy Ghost in wonder done, For of thy wife there shall be borne a Sonne, From him alone Redemption all begins, And he shall saue his people from their sinnes. This being said, the Angell past away, And Ioseph with his Virgin-wife did stay: Then he and she with speed prepared them To goe to Dauids Citty Bethelem. Through winters weather, frost, &amp; wind, and snow, Foure weary daies in trauell they bestow. But when to Bethlem they approched were, Small friendship, &amp; lesse welcome they found there: No chamber, nor no fire to warme them at, For harbor onely they a Stable gat: The Inne was full of more respected guests, Of Drunkards, Swearers, and of godlesse beasts: Those all had roomes, whilst Glory and all Grace, (But among beasts) could haue no lodging place. There (by protection of th'Almighties wings) Was borne the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings. Our God with vs, our great Emanuel, Our Iesus, and our vanquisher of hell. There in a cratch a Iewell was brought forth, More then ten thousand thousand worlds is worth, There did the humane nature and diuine, The Godhead with the Manhood both combine: There was this Maiden-mother brought to bed, Where Oxen, Kine, and Horses lodg'd and fed: There this bright Queene of Queenes with heau'nly ioy, Did hug her Lord, her Life, her God, her Boy, Her Sonne, her Sauiour, her immortall Blisse, Her sole Redeemer, she might rocke and kisse. Oh blessed Lady, of all Ladies blest: Blessed for euer, for thy sacred brest Fed him that all the famisht soules did feed, Of the lost sheepe of Israels forlorne seed. A Stable being Heau'n and earths great Court. When forty dayes were ended in that sort, This Virgin-Mother, and this Maiden-Bride, (All pure) yet by the Law was purifide. Old Simeon being in the Temple than, He saw the Sonne of God, and Sonne of man. He in his aged armes the Babe imbrac'd, And ioying in his heart he so was grac'd, He with these words wisht that his life might cease: Lord, let thy Seruant now depart in peace, Mine eyes haue seene thy great saluation, My Loue, my Iesus, my Redemption: Unto the Gentiles euerlasting light, To Israel the glory and the might. Hope, faith and zeale, truth, constancy and loue, To sing this Song did good old Simeon moue. Then turning to our Lady most diuine, Thy Sonne (said he) shall once stand for a signe, And he shall be the cause that many shall By faith or vnbeliefe arise or fall. He shall be raild vpon without desert, And then sorrowes sword pierce through thy heart. As Iesus fame grew dayly more and more. The tyrant Herod is amazed sore. The Sages said, Borne was great Iudaes King, Which did vsurping Herods conscience fling: For Herod was an Idumean base, Not of the Kings of Iudahs Royall Race: And hearing one of Dauids true-borne Line Was borne, he fear'd his State he should resigne: And well he knew he kept the Iewes in awe, With slauish feare, not loue, 'gainst right and law. For tis most true: “A Prince that's fear'd of many, “Must many feare, and scarce be lou'd of any. Herod beleaguer'd with doubts, feares and woes, That Iesus should him of his Crowne depose, He chaf'd and vext, and almost grew starke mad, To vsurpation he did murther adde; An Edict sprung from his hell-hatched braine, Commanding all male Infants should be slaine Of two yeeres old and vnder through the Land, Supposing Iesus could not scape his hand. But God to Ioseph downe an Angell sent, Commanding him by flight he should preuent The murd'rers malice, and to Egypt flye, To saue our Sauiour from his tyranny. Our blessed Lady with a carefull flight, Her blessed Babe away did beare by night; Whilst Bethelem with bloody villaines swarmes, That murth'red Infants in their mothers armes: Some slaughter'd in their cradles, some in bed, Some at the dugge, some newly borne strucke dead: Some sweetly fast asleepe, some smiles ewake, All butcher'd for their Lord and Sauiours sake. Their wofull mothers madly here and there Ran rending of their cheekes, their eyes, and haire: The Tyrant they with execrations curst, And in despaire, to desp'rate acts out-burst. Some all in fury end their wofull liues By banefull poison, halters, or by kniues: And som with sorrow were so fast combin'd, They wept, and wept, and, wept themselues starke blind: And being blind (to lengthen out their mones) They piec'd their sorrows out with sighs &amp; grones, Thus with vnceasing griefe in many a mother, Teares, sighs, &amp; grones did one succeede the other. But till the Tyrant Herods dayes were done, The Virgin staid in Egypt with her Sonne. Then backe to Nazareth they return'd againe. When twelue yeeres age our Sauiour did attaine, Her Sonne, her selfe, her Husband, all of them Together trauell'd to Ierusalem; The Virgin there much sorrow did endure, The most pure Mother lost her Child most pure. Three daies with heauy hearts, with care &amp; thought Their best belou'd they diligently sought: But when she found her Lord she held most deare, Ioy banisht griefe, and loue exiled feare. There in the Temple Iesus did confute The greatest Hebrew Doctors in dispute: But Doctors all are dunces in this case, To parley with th'Eternall Sonne of Grace: Th'Immortall, mighty, Wisedome and the Word, Can make all humane sapience meere absurd. Sonne after this, (as ancient Writers say,) God tooke the Virgins Virgin-spouse away. Good Ioseph dide, and went to heauenly rest, Blest by th'Almighties mercy 'mongst the blest. Thus Mary was of her Good-man bereft, A Widdow, Maiden, Mother being left: In holy contemplation she did spend Her life for such a life as n'er shall end. Search but the Scriptures, as our Sauiour bid, There shall you find the wonders that he did: As first, how he (by his high power diuine) At Canaa turned Water into Wine: How he did heale the blind, deafe, dumb &amp; lame: How with his word he winds and seas did tame: How he from men possest fiends dispossest: How he to all that came gaue ease and rest: How with two fishes and fiue loaues of bread, He fed fiue thousand: how he rais'd the dead: How all things that he euer did or taught, Past and surpast all that ere taught or wrought: And by these miracles he sought each way To draw soules to him, too long gone astray. At last approacht the full prefixed time, That Gods blest Sonne must dye for mans curst crime. Then Iesus to Ierusalem did goe, And left his Mother full of griefe and woe, Oh woe of woes, and griefe surpassing griefe, To see her Sauiour captiu'd as a thiefe: Her Loue (beyond all loues) her Lord her all, Into the hands of sinfull slaues to fall! If but a mother haue a wicked sonne, That hath to all disordred orders runne, As treasons, rapes, blasphemings, murther, theft, And by the Law must be of life bereft; Yet though he suffer iustly by desert, His suff'ring surely wounds his mothers heart. Suppose a woman haue a vertuous childe, Religious, honest, and by nature milde, And he must be to execution brought, For some great fault he neuer did nor thought, And she behold him when to death hee's put: Then sure tormenting griefe her heart must cut. These griefes are all as nothing vnto this, Of this blest Mother of eternall blisse: Her gracious Sonne that neuer did amisse, His gracelesse seruant with a Iudas kisse Betraid him vnto misbeleeuing slaues, Where he was led away with bils and staues, To Annas, Cæiphas, Pilate, and to those That to th'Immortall God were mortall foes. Ah Iudas, couldst thou make so base account Of Him, whose worth doth heauen and earth surmount? Didst thou esteeme of 30. paltry pence, More then the life of the eternall Prince? O monstrous blindnesse, that for so small gaine, Sold endlesse blisse, to buy perpetuall paine! Is't possible damn'd auarice could compell Thee sell heau'ns Kingdome for the sinke of hell? Our Father Adam vnto all our woes, Did for an Apple blessed Eden lose: And Esau borne a Lord, yet like a slaue, His birth-right for a messe of pottage gaue: And poore Gehezi telling of a lye, His couetousnesse gain'd his leprosie. And though the text their deeds doe disallow. Yet they made better matches farre then thou. I doe not heere impute this deed of shame On Iudas, because Iudas was his name: For of that name there haue beene men of might, Who the great battels of the Lord did fight, And others more. But sure this impure blot Stickes to him, as hee's nam'd Iskarriott: For in an Anagram Iskarriott is, By letters transposition, traytor kis. Iskarriott Anagramma. Traitor Kis. Kisse, Traytor, kisse, with an intent to kill, And cry all haile, when thou dost meane all ill, And for thy fault no more shall Iudas be A name of treason and foule infamie, But all that fault I'le on Iskarriott throw, Because the Anagram explaines it so. Iskarriott for a bribe, and with a kisse, Betraid his Master, the blest King of Blisse: And after (but too late) with conscience wounded, Amaz'd, and in his senses quite confounded, With crying, Woe, woe, woe, oh woe on me, I haue betraid my Master for a fee; Oh I haue sinned, sinned past compare, And want of grace, and faith pluckes on despaire. Oh too-too late it is to call for grace! What shall I doe? where is some secret place, That I might shield me from the wrath of God? I haue deseru'd his euerlasting rod. Then farewell grace, and faith, and hope, and loue, You are the gifts of the great God aboue, You onely on th'Elect attendants be: Despaire, hell, horror, terror is for me, My hainous sinne is of such force and might, 'Twill empt th'Exchequer of Gods mercy quite: And therefore for his mercy Ile not call, But to my iust deseru'd perdition fall. I still most gracelesse haue all grace withstood, And now I haue betraid the guiltlesse blood. My Lord and Master I haue sold for pelfe, This hauing said, despayring, hang'd himselfe. There we leaue him, and now must be exprest Something of her from vvhom I haue digrest. The Virgins heart vvith thousand griefs vvas nipt, To see her Sauiour slouted, hated, vvhipt, Despightfulnesse beyond despight vvas vs'd, And vvith abuse past all abuse abus'd. His apprehension grieu'd her heart full sore, His cruell scourges grieu'd her ten times more, And wh? his blessed head with thorns was crown'd Then floods of griefe on griefe her soule did wo?d, But then redoubled was her griefe and feare, When to his death his Crosse she saw him beare. And lastly (but alas not least nor last) When he vpon the tree was nailed fast, With bitter teares, &amp; deep heart-wounding grones, With sobs, and sighs, this Maiden-Mother moanes. What tongue or pen can her great griefe vnfold, When Christ said, Woman, now thy Sonne behold? That voyce (like Ice in Iune) more cold and chill, Did dangerously wound, and almost kill: Then (as old Simeon prophesi'd before) The sword of sorrow through her heart did gore. And if 'twere possible all womens woes One woman could within her brest inclose, They were but puffes, sparkes, mole-hills, drops of raine; To whirl-winds, meteors, Kingdomes, or the maine: Vnto the woes, griefes, sorrowes, sighs, and teares, Sobs, gronings, terrors, and a world of feares, Which did beset this Virgin on each side, When as her Sonne, her Lord, and Sauiour dide. Thus he, to whom compar'd, all things are drosse, Humbled himselfe to death, euen to the Crosse: He that said, Let there be, and there was light, He that made all things with his mighty might, He by whom all things haue their life and breath, He humbled himselfe vnto the death; Vnto the death of the curst Crosse: this he, This he, this He of hee's did stoope for me: For me this Wel-spring of my soules releefe, Did suffer death, on either hand a theefe: The one of them had runne a theeuing race, Rob'd God of Glory, and himselfe of Grace: He wanted liuely faith to apprehend, To end his life for life that ne'r shall end: With faithlesse doubts his minde is armed stiffe, And doth reuile our Sauiour with an If, If that thou be the Sonne of God (quoth he) Come from the Crosse, and saue thy selfe and me. The other Theefe, arm'd with a sauing faith, Vnto his fellow turn'd, and thus he saith; Thou guilty wretch, this man is free and cleare From any crime for which he suffers here: We haue offended, we haue iniur'd many, But this man yet did neuer wrong to any, We iustly are condemn'd, he false accus'd, He hath all wrong, all right to vs is vs'd, Hee's innocent, so are not thou and I: We by the Law are iustly iudg'd to dye. Thus the good Theefe euen at his latest cast, Contrary to a Theefe, spake truth at last. And looking on our Sauiour faithfully, (Whilst Christ beheld him with a gracious eye) These blest words were his prayers totall summe, O Lord when thou shalt to thy Kingdome come, Remember me. Our Sauiour answer'd then (A doctrine to confute despairing men,) Thou (who by liuely faith laist hold on me) This day in. Paradise with me shalt be. Thus as this theefes life was by theft supplide, So now he stole heau'ns Kingdome when he dyde. And I doe wish all Christians to agree, Not t'liue as ill, but dye as well as he. Presumptuous sinnes are no way here excus'd, For here but one was sau'd, and one refus'd. Despaire for sinnes hath here no rule or ground, For as here's one was lost, so one was found. To teach vs not to sinne with wilfull pleasure, And put repentance off, to our last leasure. To shew vs though we liu'd like Iewes and Turkes, Yet Gods great mercy is aboue his workes. To warne vs not presume, or to despaire, Here's good example in this theeuing paire. These seas of care (with zealous fortitude) This Virgin past among the multitude. (Oh gracious patterne of a sex so bad) Oh the supernall patience that she had, Her zeale, her constancy, her truth, her loue, The very best of women her doth proue. Maids, wiues, and mothers, all conforme your liues To hers, the best of women, maides, or wiues. But as her Sonnes death made her woes abound, His resurrection all griefe did confound: She saw him vanquish't and inglorious, And after saw him Victor most victorious: She saw him in contempt to lose his breath, And after that she saw him conquer death: She saw him (blest) a cursed death to dye, And after saw him rise triumphantly: Thus she that sorrowed most, had comfort most, Ioy doubly did returne, for gladnesse lost, And as before her torments tyranniz'd, Her ioy could after not be equalliz'd; Her Sonnes (all-wondred) resurrection, Her Sauiours glorious ascension, And last, the Holy Ghost from heauen sent downe, These mighty mercies all her ioyes did crowne. Suppose a man that were exceeding poore, Had got a thousand tunnes of golden ore, How would his heart be lifted vp with mirth, As this great masse of treasure (most part earth) But to be rob'd of all in's height of glory, Would not this lucklesse man be much more sory Then euer he was glad? for in the minde Griefe more then ioy doth most abiding finde. But then suppose that after all this losse, The gold is well refined from the drosse, And as the poore man doth his losse complaine, His wealth (more pure) should be restor'd againe. Amidst his passions (in this great reliefe) I doubt not but his ioy would conquer griefe. Euen so our blessed Lady hauing lost Her ioy, her Iewell she esteemed most, Her all in all, the heau'n and earths whole treasure, Her gracious heart was grieued out of measure. But when she found him in triumphaut state, No tongue or pen her ioy could then relate. She lost him poore and bare, and dead and cold, She found him rich, most glorious to behold. She lost him when vpon his backe was hurld The burthen of the sinnes of all the World: She lost him mortall, and immortall found him, For crown of thorns, a crown of glory crownd him. Thus all her griefes, her losse, her cares, and paine, Return'd with ioyes inestimable gaine. But now a true relation I will make, How this blest Virgin did the world forsake. 'Tis probable that as our Sauiour bid Saint Iohn to take her home, that so he did: And it may be suppos'd she did abide With him, and in his house vntill she dide. Iohn did out-liue th'Apostles euery one, For when Domitian held th'Imperiall Throne, To th'Ile of Pathmos he was banisht then, And there the Reuelation he did pen: But whilst Iohn at Ierusalem did stay, God tooke the blessed Virgins life away. For after Christs Ascension it appeares, She on the earth suruiued fifteene yeeres, Full sixty three in all she did endure, A sad glad pilgrimage, a life most pure. At sixty three yeeres age her life did fade, Her soule (most gracious) was most glorious made, Where with her Son, her Sauiour, her Lord God, She euerlastingly hath her abode, In such fruition of immortall glory, Which cannot be describ'd in mortall story. There mounted (meeke) she sits in Maiesty; Exalted there is her humility, There she that was adorned full of Grace, Beheld her Maker and Redeemers face. And there she is amongst all blessed spirits (By imputation of our Sauiours merits,) She there shall euer and for euer sing Eternall praise vnto th'Eternall King. When she had paid the debt that all must pay, When from her corps her soule was past away: To Gethsemany, with lamenting cheare, Her sacred body on the Beere they beare. There in the earth a Iewell was inter'd, That was before all earthly wights prefer'd, That Holy wife, that Mother, that pure Maid, At Gethsemany in her graue was laid. Lenvoy. This worke deserues the worke of better wit, But I (like Pilate) say, What's writ is writ: If it be lik'd: poore artlesse I am glad, And Charity I hope will mend what's bad. I know my selfe the meanest amongst men, The most vnlearnedst that e'r handled pen: But as it is, into the world I send it, And therefore pray commend it, or come mend it. FINIS.

TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, WORTHY, and Learned Gentleman, S?. Thomas Richardson Knight, Lord Chiefe Iustice of his Maiesties Court of Common Pleas, and Speaker in the High Court of Parliament, &amp;c. A double Anagramme. Thomas Richardson, As Man Honorde Chrit, So Christ Honerd A Man.

A FEW LINES, TO SMALL PURPOSE, AGAINST THE SCANDALOUS ASPERSIONS, that are either maliciously, or ignorantly cast vpon the Poets and Poems of these Times. There doth a strange, and true opinion runne, That Poets write much worse, then they haue don: And how so poore their daily writings are, As though their best inuentions were thread-bare. And how no new things from them now do spring, But all hath ref'rence from some other thing: And that their daily doings doe reueale, How they from one another filch and steale, As if amongst them 'twere a statute made, That they may freely vse the theeuing trade. And some there are that will not sticke to say, That many Poets liuing at this day, Who haue the Hebrew, Latine, Greeke, at will, And in th'Italian and the French haue skill, These are the greatest theeues they say, of all That vse the Trade (or Art) Poeticall. For ancient Bards, and Poets in strange toungs, Compiled haue their verses and their songs: And those to wh? those tongues are rightly known, Translating them, make others verse their owne; As one that steales a Cloake, and presently Makes it his owne, by alt'ring of the dye. So whole bookes, and whole sentences haue bin Stolne, and the stealers, great applause did win, And by their filching thought great men of fame, By those that knew not the right Authors name. For mine owne part, my Conscience witnesse is, I n'er was guilty of such theft as this, Vnto such robbery I could neuer reach, Because I vnderstand no forreigne speach. To prooue that I am from such filching free, Latin and French are heathen-Greeke to me, The Grecian, and the Hebrew Charactars, I know as well, as I can reach the Stars. The sweet Italian, and the Chip Chop Dutch, I know, the man i'th Moone can speake as much. Should I from English Authors, but purloyne, It would be soone found counterfeited coyne. Then since I cannot steale, but some will spy, Ile truely vse mine owne, let others lye. Yet to excuse the writers, that now write, Because they bring no better things to light: Tis because bounty from the world is fled, True liberality is almost dead. Reward is lodg'd in darke obliuion deep, Bewitch't (I thinke) into an endlesse sleepe, That though a man in study take great paines, And empt his veines, puluerize his braines, To write a Poem well, which being writ With all his Iudgement, Reason, Art, and Wit, And at his owne charge, print and pay for all, And giue away most free, and liberall Two, three, or foure, or fiue hundred bookes, For his reward he shall haue nods and lookes; That all the profit a mans paines hath gat, Will not suffice one meale to feed a Cat. Yet still Noble Westminster, thou still art free, And for thy bounty I am bound to thee: For hadst not thou, and thy Inhabitants, From Time to Time relieu'd and help'd my wants, I had long since bid Poetry adieu, And therefore still my thankes shall be to you. Next to the Court, in generall I am bound To you, for many friendships I haue found. There (when my purse hath often wanted bait) To fill or feed it, I haue had receite. So much for that, I'le now no more rehearse, They shew their loues in prose, my thankes in verse: When death, Mecænas did of life depriue, Few of his Noble Tribe were left aliue, This makes inuention to be meane and hard, When Pride and Auarice doth kill reward. And yet me thinkes, it plainely doth appeare, Mens writings are as good as e're they were. Good lines are like a Banquet ill imployd, Where too much feeding hath the stomack cloyd. Good verses fall sometimes (by course of fate) Into their hands that are preiudicate. And though the Writer n'er so well hath pend, Yet they'le find fault with what they cannot mend. Thus many a learned well composed line, Hath bin a Pearle that's cast before a swine. Or more familiarly to make compare; Like Aqua vita giuen vnto a Mare. These fellowes, (glutted with variety) Hold good lines in a loath'd saciety, Whilst paltry Riming, Libels, Iigges and Iests, Are to their appetites continuall feasts, With which their fancies they doe feed and fill, And take the Ill for good, the Good for ill. Whilst like to M?keyes, scorning wholsome meate) They greedily doe poysnous spiders eate. So let them feed vntill their humours burst, And thus much bold to tell them heere I durst, That Poetry is now as good as euer, If to bounty, relieue her would endeuer. Mens mindes are worse then they haue bin ofyore, Inuention's good now, as it was before. Let liberality awake, and then Fach Poet in his hand will take a pen, And with rare lines inrich a world of paper, Shall make Apollo, and the Muses caper. SVPERBIAE FLAGELLVM, OR THE VVHIP OF PRIDE. VVhen all things were as wrap'd in sable night, And If any man fetch his Story higher, let him take my booke for nought. Ebon darknes muffled vp the light: When neither Sun, or Moone, nor Stars had shinde, And when no fire, no Water, Earth, or Wind, No Haruest, Autumne, Winter, when no Spring, No Bird, Beast, Fish, nor any creeping thing, When there was neither Time nor place, nor space, And silence did the Chaos round imbrace: Then did the Archworkmaster of this All, Create this Massie Vniuersall Ball, And with his mighty Word brought all to passe, Saying, but Let there be, and done it was. Let there be Day, Night, Water, Earth, Hearbs, Trees, Let there be Sunne, Moone, Stars, Fish, Fowle that flees, Beasts of the Field, he said but, Let there be, And all things were created as we see. Thus euery sensible and senselesse thing, The High-Creators Word to passe did bring: And as in viewing all his workes he stood, He saw that all things were exceeding good. Thus hauing furnisht Seas, and Earth and Skies, Abundantly with all varieties, Like a Magnificent and sumptuous Feast, For th'entertainment of some welcome Guest, When Beasts and Birds, and euery liuing Creature, And the Earths fruits did multiply by Nature; Then did th'Eternall Trinity betake It selfe to Councell, and said, Let vs make, Not Let there be, as vnto all things else, But Let Vs Make Man, that the rest excels; According To Ovr Image Let Vs Make Man, and then did th'Almightie Red Earth take, With which he formed Adam, euery limme, And (hauing made him) breathed life in him. Loe, thus the first Man neuer was a Child, No way with sinne originall defil'd: But with high Supernat'rall Vnderstanding, He ouer all the World had sole commanding. Imperfect Holinesse and Righteousnesse. Yet though to him the Regency was giuen, As Earths Lieutenant to the God of Heauen, Though he commanded all created things, As Deputy vnder the King of Kings; Though so he highly here was dignifide, To humble him, not to be puff'd with Pride, He could not brag, or boast of high borne birth, For he was formed out of slime and earth: No beast, fish, worme, fowle, herbe, weed, stone, or tree, But are of a more ancient house then he; For they were made before him, which proues this, That their Antiquity is more then his. Thus both himselfe, and his beloued Spouse, Are by Creation of the younger house, And whilst they liu'd in perfect Holinesse, Their richest Garments were bare Nakednesse, True Innocency were their chiefest weeds, (For Righteousnesse no Masque or Visor needs.) The royal'st robes that our first Parents had, Was a free Conscience with Vprightnesse clad; They needed ne'r to shift; the cloathes they wore, Was Nakednesse, and they desir'd no more Vntill at last, that Hell-polluting sin, With Disobedience soil'd their Soules within, And hauing lost their holines Perfection, They held their Nakednes an Imperfection, Then (being both asham'd) they both did frame Garments, as weedes of their deserued shame. Thus, when as sinne had brought Gods curse on man, Then shame to make Apparell first began: E're man had sin'd, most plaine it doth appeare, He neither did, or needed Garments weare, For his Apparell did at first beginne, To be the Robes of penance for his sinne. Thus all the brood of Adam, and of Eue, The true vse of Apparell may perceiue, That they are Liueries, Badges vnto all Of our sinnes, and our Parents wofull fall. Then more then mad, these mad-brain'd people be (Or else theysee, and will not seeme to see) That these same Robes (with Pride) that makes them swell, Are tokens that our best desert is hell. ComparisonMuch like vnto a Traytor to his King That would his Countrey to destruction bring, Whose Treasons being prou'd apparantly, He by the Law is iustly iug'd to dye, And when he lookes for his deserued death, A Pardon comes and giues him longer breath, I thinke this man most madly would appeare That would a halter in a glory weare, Because he with a halter merited Of life, to be quite desinherited. But if he should vainegloriously persist To make a Rope of silke or golden twist, And weare't as a more honourable show, Of his Rebellion, then course hempe or towe, Might not men iustly say he were an Asse, Triumphing that he once a Villaine was, And that he wore a halter for the nonce, In pride that he deserued hanging once? Such with our heau'nly Father is the Case, Of our first Parents, and their sinfull Race, Apparell is the miserable signe, That we are Traytors to our Lord diuine, And we (like Rebels) still most pride doe take In that which still most humble should vs make. Apparell is the prison for our sinne Which most should shame, yet most we Glory in; Apparell is the sheete of shame as't were Which (for our penance) on our backs we beare, For man Apparell neuer did receiue, Till he eternall Death deseru'd to haue. And thus Apparell to our sense doth tell Our sinnes 'gainst Heau'n, and our desert of Hell. How vaine is it for man, a clod of Earth, To boast of his high progeny, or Birth, Because (perhaps) his Ancestors were good, And sprung from Royall, or from Noble blood, Where Vertuous worth did in their minds inherit, Who gain'd their Honours by Desert and Merit; Whose seruice for their Country neuer fai'ld, Who (iustly) liu'd belou'd, and dyde bewaild; Whose Affability, and Charity, Guided with pious true sincerity, Who to their states lou'd all their liues to ioyne Loue before Lands, Compassion before Coyne? Yet when they dyde, left wealth, place, state, and name, To Heires who oury all in Pride &amp; shame, But as the Sacred Truth most truly saith, “No man is saued by anothers Faith: So though some honourable Rascals haue Turn'd their good Fathers to their timelesse graue, And like Ignoble noble Reprobates, Possesse their names, possessions and estates, Yet (for they want their Vertues and Deserts) They are but Bastards to their better parts. Manasses was good Hezechiahs sonne, And with his Crowne into a Vice did runne; The Sire the title of good King did gaine, The Sonn's Abominations all did staine; Honour is better well deseru'd then had, To haue it vndeseru'd, that Honour's bad. In Rome an ancient Law there sometimes was, Men should through Vertue vnto Honor passe. And 'tis a Rule that euermore hath bin, “That Honor's best which a mans selfe doth win. 'Tis no Inheritance, nor can it runne Successiuely from Father to the Sonne; But if the Father nobly were inclin'd, And that the Sonne retaine his worthy mind, If with his Fathers goods he doth possesse His goodnesse, all the world must then confesse, That that Sonnes Honor doth it selfe display To be the Fathers equall euery way. Thus good mens Honors can no Honor be To their degenerate posteritie, But 'tis a mans owne Vertue, or his Vice, That makes his Honor high or low in price. Of Birth, or Parents, no man can be proud, Pride of Apparell here is disallow'd, Pride of our Riches is most Transitory, Pride of our Beauty is a fading Glory: Pride of our wisedome is most foolish fony: Pride of our holines is most vnholy, Pride of our strength is weakenes in our thought, And Pride in any thing is come to nought. Pride hath bin Author of the worst of Euils, Esay 14. 14.Transforming glorious Angels, into Deuils, When Babels Tow'r gan proudly to aspire, With toungs confusion, they were paid their hire. Through Pride the King of Babels glory ceast, Daniel 4. Daniel 5.And for seu'n yeeres it turn'd him to a beast; And Baltazar that next him did succeede, Lost life, and left his Empire to the Mede, For Pride, to Tyre and Zidons wicked Kings Acts 12. Josephus lib 19. cap. 7. Acts. 8. Plutarch, in the life of of Alexander, He was poysoned at Babylon.The Prophet a most iust destruction brings. Herod mid'st his vngodly glory vaine, Through Pride was eaten vp with wormes, and slaine, Great The Mèdes and Persians. Alexander, King of Macedon, Disdaind to be his father Phillips son, But he from Iupiter would be descended, And as a god be honour'd and attended, Yet Bain'de at Babylon he prou'd but man, His godhead ended foolish as't began. There was in Sicilie a proud Physitian, Menecrates, and he through high ambition, To be a god, himselfe would needs preferre, And would (forsooth) be named Iupiter, King Dionysius making a great feast, This foole-god daigned there to be a guest, Who by himselfe was at a table plac'd, (Because his godhead should the more be grac'd) The other Guests themselues did feed and fill, He at an empty table still, sate still. At last with humble low Sir Reuerence, A fellow came with fire and Frankincense, And offer'd to his godship, (saying then) Perfumes were fit for gods, and meate for men: The god in anger rose incontinent Well laugh'd at, and an hunger'd, home he went. The Romane Emperour Domitian Would be a god, was murther'd by a man. Caligula would be a god of wonder, And counterfeite the lightning, and the thunder; Yet euery Reall heau'nly Thundercracke, This Caitife in such feare and terror strake, That he would quake, and shake, &amp; hide his head In any hole, or vnderneath his bed. And when this godlesse god had many slaine, A Tribune dasht out his vngodly braine. “And thus th'Almighty still 'gainst Pride doth frowne, “And casts Ambition headlong tumbling downe. Great Pompey would be all the worlds superior, And Cæsar vnto none would be inferior; But as they both did liue ambitiously, So both of them vntimely deaths did dye. The one in Ægypt had his finall fall, The other murthered in the Capitall. A number more Examples are beside, Which shewes the miserable fall of Pride: And doe men thinke to goe to Heauen from hence By Pride, which cast the Angels headlong thence? Or doe they through their Pride suppose to dwell With God, when Pride did make the Deuils in hell? It is a Vice which God abhors and hates, And 'gainst it doth denounce most fearefull threats. Oh, what a hellish vanity is't then, That doth bewitch vaine women, and vile men, That rather then their Pride and they will seuer, They will be seuer'd from their God for euer? I will not say but Wisedome, Beauty, Health, Strength, Courage, Magnanimity, and Wealth, Empires and Kingdomes, rule of Sea, and Land, Are blessings giuen by Gods all-giuing hand; But not because on whom they are bestow'd, Should in the stead of Humblenesse waxe proud, Or with vaine glory haue their hearts vpheau'd: For why? 1. Cor.4. what ere they haue, they haue receiu'd: And therefore Christian Kings their stile doe grace King By the Grace of God, of such a place; Because by his especiall prouidence They hold Maiesticall Preheminence. And as there is distinction of Estates, Some Emp'rours, Kings, and mighty Potentates, Superiors and Inferiors, each degree, As Gods foreknowing Knowledge did foresee: Yet he did not bestow his bounteous Grace, To make the great men proud, or meane men base; Aboundant wealth he to the Rich doth lend, That they the poore should succour and defend. He hath giu'n strength and vigour to the strong, That they shuld guard the weak fr? taking wrong: To some he knowledge doth and wisdome grant, Because they should instruct the Ignorant: But vnto no man God his gifts doth giue, To make him proud, or proudly here to liue. For Pride of state, birth, wisedome, beauty, strength, And Pride in any thing, will fall at length, But to be proud of Garments that we weare, Is the most foolish pride a heart can beare. For as they are the Robes of sinne and shame, Yet more may be consider'd in the same: Be they compact of silke, or cloth of Gold, Or cloth, or stuffes, (of which ther's manifold) Let them be lac'd and fac'd, or cut, or plaine, Or any way to please the wearers braine, And then let him or her that is so clad, Consider but from whence these stuffes were had, How Mercers, Drapers, silkmen were the Iaylers. And how the Executioners were Taylers, That did both draw and quarter, slash and cut, And into shape, mishapen Remns-ants put. Consider this, and you will graunt me than, That Garments are the workemanship of man. Which being granted no man can deny, But that it is most base Idolatry, T'adore or worship a proud paltry knaue, Because the Mercers shop hath made him braue. Or is it not a foolish vile mistaking, To Honour things that are a A Taylor is but a man; therefore it is idolatry to worship his workmanship. Taylers making? I make a vowe, that neuer whilst I liue A Reuerence to Apparell will I giue; Some goodnesse in the wearer I'le expect, Or else from me he shall haue small Respect; If in him vertue, and true worth I see, He shall haue heart and hand, and cap and knee. Tis laudable there should be diff'rence made Betwixt a Courtier, and a man of Trade: For sense or reason neuer would allow, A Prince to weare a habit for the Plow: Nor that a Carter vainely should aspire, To thrust himselfe into the Court attire. Distinctions of Office, and Estates Should habit men according to their rates. Thus I rich Garments no way doe condemne, But I say no man should be proud of them. In Rome, a worthy Law there once was made, That euery man, of each degree and Trade, Some marke or badge, about him still should beare, Whereby men knew what all mens-callings were. The Consuls bearing the Imperiall sway, (To whose command the rest did all obey) In token they had power to saue or spill, Had Rods and Axes borne before them still. The Censors, Tribunes, Ædiles, and the Prætors, The Prouosts, Questors, and the Conseruators, And as their offices were sundry varied, So were they known by things before them carried. The Mercer in his hat did weare some tuffe, Or shred of Silke, or Gold, his trading stuffe; Drapers a piece of List, Weauers a quill, Or Shuttle, and the Millers wore a Mill. And as men sundry callings did apply, So they wore Emblemes to be knowne thereby. But if that Law were but enacted here, How like a pluckt crow, would Pride soon appeare? Some Taylors would be very mad at that, To weare each one a Bodkin in his hat; There's many a wealthy Whoremaster would skip, And stamp, and start, if he should weare a whip: But yet if euery thiefe of each degree Were bound to weare a halter, God blesse me: A Butcher still should weare a Calfe or Bull, My selfe (a Waterman) an Oare or Skull. And so of euery trade both high and low, Men (by their badges) would their fuuctions know. And if this Law the State would but allow, Some would weare Calues skins, that weare veluet now. Then Iacke and Iill, and Iohn a Drones his issue, Would not be trapped thus in Gold and Tissue. 'Tis strange a coxcomb should be cram'd with pride, Because he hath got on a Sattin hide: A Grogreine outside, or a siluer Case, Some fourteene groce of buttons, and Gold lace; When as perhaps the corps that carries all, Hath more diseases then an Hospitall, And (which is worst of all) his Soule within, Stinks before God, polluted with all sinne. Romes great Arch-tyrant Nero, amongst all The matchlesse vices he was tax'd withall, (The which in Histories are truely told,) Was said t'haue shoo-ties al wrought o'r with gold, If in an Emperour (that did command Almost the whole world, both by Sea and Land, Who countermaunded Indian Mines and Iems, Iewels, and almost all earths Diadems,) To weare gold shoo-strings were a noted crime, What may it then be called at this time, When many, below Hostlers in degree, Shall (in that point) be deckt as braue as he? Thus Pride's an ouerweening selfe opinion, A soule-destroyer, come from Hels dominion; Which makes vianglorious fools, &amp; new found Madams Forget they are of Eues good brood &amp; Adams, But yet though Pride be a most deadly sinne, What numbers by it doe their liuings vvinne? A vvorld of people daily liue thereby; Who (vvere it not for it) would starue and dye. Thus (by coruption of the time) this Deuill Is grovvne a good, bad, necessary euill. She is the Mercers onely fruitfull crop, She is the Silkman, and th'Embrod'rers prop; She is the Haberdashers chiefest Stocke, She feeds the Hat-sellers vvith blocke on blocke; She makes the Dyers daily liue to dye, And dye to liue, and get great vvealth thereby; She (euery Winter) doth the Draper feed, With food and fuell She supplies his need: She is the Taylors goddesse; and vpon her He daily doth attend to doe her honour; All the inuentions of his studious pate, He at her shrine doth euer consecrate, He rakes the vvorld for fashions that excell, From Germany, from France, from Spaine, from Hell; And vvould himselfe be out of fashion quite, But that Pride in nevv fashions doth delight. Silke-vveauers (of the vvich abundance are) Wer't not for Pride, vvould liue, and dye most bare: Sempsters with ruffs and cuffs, &amp; quoifes, and caules, And falles, (wer't not for pride) would soone haue falles. The Shoomakers neat, spanish, or polony, Would haue but single-soal'd receit of money. The sweet perfumers would be out of fauour, And hardly could be sauers by their fauour. The glittering Ieweller, and Lapidary, (But for Prides helpe) were in a poore quandary. The Goldsmiths plate would stand vpon his shelfe, And's Rings and Chaines he might weare out himselfe. Thus Pride is growne to such a height, I say, That were she banish'd, many would decay: For many hundred thousands are, you see, Which from Pride only, haue meat, cloaths, and fee. No maruell then she hath so many friends, When as such numbers on her still depends, Pride is their Mistres, she maintaines them still, And they must serue her, or their case is ill. But as so many numbers numberlesse, Doe liue and flourish here by Prides excesse: So are there more vpon the other side, Toild and tormented still to maintaine Pride. The painfull Plowmans paines doe neuer cease, For he must pay his Rent, or lose his lease, And though his Father and himselfe before, Haue oft relieu'd poore beggers at their doore; Yet now his Fine and Rent so high is rear'd, That his own meat, and cloathes are scarcely clear'd, Let him toyle night and day, in light and darke, Lye with the Lambe downe, rise vp with the Larke, Dig, delue, plow, sow, rake, harrow, mow, lop, fell, Plant, graft, hedge, ditch, thresh, winnow, buy &amp; sell; Yet all the money that his paines can win, His Land-lord hath a purse to put it in. What though his Cattell with the Murraine dye, Or that the Earth her fruitfulnesse deny? Let him beg, steale, grieue, labour and lament, The Quarter comes, and he must pay his Rent; And though his Fine and Rent be high; yet higher It shall be rais'd, if once it doth expire: Let him and his be hunger-staru'd and pin'de, His Land-lord hath decreed his bones to grinde: And all this carke and care, and toile of his, Most chiefly for this onely purpose is, That his gay Land-lord may weare silke &amp; feather, Whilst he poore drudge can scarce get frize or leather; Because his Land-lady may dog the fashion, Hee's rack'd and tortur'd without all compassion; Because his Land-lords Heyre may haue renowne Of Gentle, though the Father be a Clowne: Because his Landlords daughters (deckt with pride) With ill-got portions may be Ladyfide. In briefe, poore tenants pinch for clothes and food To dawb with pride their Landlords &amp; their brood. The time hath bin (and some aliue knowes when) A Gentleman would keepe some twenty men, Some thirty, and some forty, lesse or more, (As their Reuenews did supply their store.) And with their Charities did freely feed The Widow, Fatherlesse, and poore mans need, But then did Pride keepe residence in Hell, And was not come vpon the earth to dwell: Then Loue and Charity were at the best, Exprest in Action, not in words profest. Then conscience did keepe men in much more aw, Than the seuerest rigour of the Law, And then did men feare God (with true intent,) For's Goodnesse, not for feare of punishment. But since the Leprosie of Pride hath spred The world all ouer, from the foot to head: Good bounteous house-keeping is quite destroyd, And large reuenewes other wayes imployd; Meanes that would foure men meate and meanes allow, Are turnd to garters, and to roses now, That which kept twenty, in the dayes of old. By Satan is turn'd sattin, silke, and gold, And one man now in garments he doth weare, A thousand akers, on his backe doth beare, Whose ancestours in former times did giue, Meanes for a hundred people well to liue. Now all his shrunke, (in this vaineglorious age) T'attire a coach, a footman, and a page, To dice, drinke, drabs, tobacco, hauks &amp; hounds, These are th'expence of many thousand pounds, Whilst many thousands starue, and daily perish, For want of that which these things vs'd to cherrish. There is another Pride, which some professe, Who pinch their bellies, for their backs excesse: For thogh their guts through w?t of fodder clings, That they will make sweet filthy fiddle strings; Yet they will suffer their mawes pine and lacke, To trap with rich caparisons the backe. These people, (for their Pride) doe Iustice still, Vpon themselues, although against their will. They doe in their owne stomacks, try, examine, And punish outward Pride, with inward famine. But sure the people can be good for nothing, Whose reputation onely lyes in cloathing: Because the hangman oft may execute, A thiefe or traytor in a sattin sute, And that sute which did from the gallowes drop, May be againe hang'd in a Broakers shop, And then againe hang'd, and bought, and worne, And secondly (perhaps) to Tiburne borne: And so at sundry times, for sundry crimes, The Hangman may sell one sute sixteene times, And euery Rascall, that the same did fit, To be exceeding pockie proud of it. And all this while, (if I be not mistooke) It rests vnpaid for, in the Mercers booke. Thus many simple honest people haue, Giu'n worship to a Broakers wardrobe slaue, Thus Tiburne ornaments may be the chiefe, To grace a graceles arrant whoore, or thiefe. A Seruing-man, I in cast cloathes haue seene, That did himselfe so strangely ouerweene, That with himselfe he out of knowledge grewe, And therefore all his old friends he misknewe, Vntill at last his Glory did decrease, His outside fac'd with tatters, rags and greace, Then did the changing time, the youth transforme From Pride, to be as lowly as a worme. A many of these fellovves may be had, That's meeke or proud, as clothes are good or bad. I leaue true Noble Gentry all this while, Out of the reach of my inuectiue stile, Tis fit that those of worthy race and place, Should be distinguisht from the Vulgar base. Particulars Ile not to question call, My Satyre is 'gainst Pride in generall. Soft Rayment is in Princes Courts allow'd, Not that the wearers should thereof be proud: For worth and wisedome knowes most certainely, That Hell giues pride, and Heau'n Humility, And be their garments ne'r so rare or rich, They neuer can make Pride their hearts bewitch. Then if all sorts of men considred this, Most vaine the pride of any rayment is, For neither Sea, land, fish, fowle, worme, or beast, But man's beholding to the most and least. The silly Sheepe puts off his coate each yeere, And giues it to forgetfull man to weare: The Oxe, Calfe, Goate, and Deere doe not refuse To yeeld their skins, to make him boots &amp; shooes, And the poore silke-worme labours night and day, T'adorne and granish man with rich array: Therefore if men of this did rightly thinke, Humility would grow, and pride would shrinke. Fowles of the ayre doe yeeld both fans &amp; plpmes And a poore Ciuet-cat allowes perfumes. The Earth is rip'd and bowel'd, rent and torne, For gold and siluer which by man is worne: And sea and land are rak'd and search't &amp; sought, For Iewels too farre fetcht, and too deare bought. Thus man's beholding still (to make him trim) Vnto all creatures, and not they to him. Nature (without mans helpe) doth them supply, And man without their helpe would starue and dye. If men (I say) these things considered well, Pride then would soone be tumbled downe to hell. Their golden suits that make them much renown'd, Is but the guts and garbage of the ground: Their Ciuet (that affords such dainty sents) Is but a poore Cats sweating Excrements; Their rarest Iewels (which most glister forth) Are more for outward shew then inward worth, They are high valu'd at all times, and season, But for what reason, none can giue a reason, The best of, them like whoores, hath euer bin, Most faire without, and full of bane within. And let a great man weare a piece of glasse, It (for his sake) will for a Diamond passe; But let a man that's of but meane degree, Weare a faire Diamond, yet it glasse must be. This valuing of a Iewell is most fit It should not grace a man, man should grace it. A good man to his suite is a repute, A knaues repute lyes onely in his sute. And for a stone, that but three drams hath weigh'd, Of precious poyson, hundreds haue bin paid. And who can tell how many liues were lost, In fetching home the Bables of such cost? (For many of them as are as dearely bought, As if they from The field of blood, that the Iewes bought with thirty pieces of siluer, which Iudas brought back againe after he betrayed Christ, Mat. 27. 7. Acts 1. 19. Acheldama were brought.) Yet some rush through (fantastques pates to please) Rocks, sands &amp; change of aire, rough winds &amp; seas Storms, t?pests, gusts, flawes, pirates, sword, &amp; fire, Death, or else slauery, (neuer to retire.) And thus prides various humours to suffice, A number hazard these calamities; When our owne Countrey doth afford vs heere, Iewels more precious, nothing nigh so deere. A whetstone is more necessary sure, A grindstone much more profit doth procure: But for a A mill-stone is a peerelesse Iewell. milstone, that's a Iewell rare, With wich no other stone can make compare. The loadstone is the meanes to find the rest, But of all stones the milstone is the best. Free stones and artificiall bricks I graunt, Are stones which men in building cannot want: And the flintstone can yeeld vs fire and heate, But yet the milstone yeelds bread vs to eate. The tilestone keepes vs dry, the roadestone bydes, And holds fast Boates, in tempests, winds, and tides, The chalke stone serues for lyme, or for account To score, how reck'nings doe abate or mount. Pebles, and grauell, mend high wayes, I know, And ballast shippes, which else would ouerthrow. And this much I'le maintaine here with my pen, These are the stones that most doe profit men: These, these are they, if we consider well, That Saphirs, and the Diamonds doe excell, The Pearle, the Em'rauld, and the Turkesse bleu, The sanguine Corrall, Ambers golden hiew, The Christall, Iacinth, Achate, Ruby red, The Carbuncle, Squar'd, cut, and pollished, The Onix, Topaz, Iaspar, Hematite, The sable Iet, the Tutch, and Chrysolite; All these considred as they are indeee, Are but vaine toyes that doe mans fancy feed; The stones I nam'd before, doe much more good For building, sayling, lodging, firing, food. Yet Iewels for their lawfull vse are sent, To be a luster, and an ornament For State, magnificence, and Princely port, To shew a Kingdomes glory, at the Court; And God (I know) ordain'd them to be worne, Superiour States to honour and adorne, And for the vses they were made are good, If (as they should be) they are vnderstood: T'adorne our persons they are still allow'd, But not to buy too deare, or make vs proud. The holy Ghost in Exodus recites, How Aaron (High Priest of the Israelites) Twelue seuerall stones did on his Brest-plate beare, Which of the twelue Tribes a remembrance were; But they were mysticall, prophetique tropes, And figures of Saluations future hopes. But God did neuer giue or Gold or Iemme, Or Iewell, that we should take pride in them. The Deu'ill laugh'd lately at the stinking stir, We had about Two inuectiue Pamphlets against the monstrous &amp; shapelesse disguises of men and women. Hic Mulier, and Hæc Uir, The Masculine appareld Feminine, And Feminine attired Masculine, The Woman-man, Man-woman, chuse you whether, The Female-male, Male-female, both, yet neither; Hels Pantominicks, that themselues bedights, Like shamelesse double sex'd Hermaphrodites, Uirago Roaring Girles, that to their middle, To know what sexe they were, vvas halfe a Riddle, Braue trim'd &amp; truss'd, vvith daggers &amp; vvith dags, Stout Captaine Maudlins feather brauely vvags, Lieutenant Female Souldiers. Dol, and valiant Ensigne Besse, All arm'd with impudence and shamelesnesse; Whose Calues eg-starch may in some sort be taker As if they had beene hang'd to smoake like Bacon, Whose borrowed hayre (perhaps) not long before Drop'd from the head of some diseased Whore, Or one that at the Gallowes made her Will, Late choaked with the Hangmans Pickadill. In which respect, a Sow, a Cat, a Mare, More modest then these foolish Females are. For the bruit beasts (continuall night and day) Doe weare their owne still (and so doe not they.) But these things haue so well bin bang'd and firk'd, And Epigram'd and Satyr'd, whip'd and Ierk'd, Cudgeld and bastinadoed at the Court, And Comically stag'de to make men sport, Iyg'd, and (with all reason) mock'd in Rime, And made the onely scornefull theame of Time; And Ballad-mongers had so great a taske, (As if their muses all had got the laske.) That no more time therein my paines I'le spend, But freely leaue them to amend, or end. I saw a fellow take a white loaues pith, And rub his masters white shoces cleane therewith, And I did know that fellow, (for his pride) To want both bread and meate before he dy'de. Some I haue heard of, that haue beene so fine, To wash and bathe themselues in milke or wine, Or else with whites of egges, their faces garnish, Which makes th? looke like visors, or new varnish. Good bread, and oatmeale hath bin spilt like trash, My Lady Polecats dainty hands to wash: Such there hath bin, but now if such there are, I wish that want of food may be their share. Some practise euery day the Painters trade, And striue to mend the worke that God hath made: But these deceiuers are deceiued farre, With falsly striuing to amend, they marre: With deu'lish dawbing, plast'ring they doe spread, Deforming so themselues with white and red, The end of all their cunning that is showne, Is, God will scarcely know them for his owne. In a great frost, bare-brested, and vnlac't, I haue seene some as low as to their waste: One halfe attyr'd, the other halfe starke bare, Shewes that they halfe asham'd, halfe shamelesse are, Halfe, (or else all) from what they should be erring, And neither fish or flesh, nor good red herring. I blow'd my nailes when I did them behold: And yet that naked Pride would feele no cold. Some euery day doe powder so their haire, That they like Ghosts, or Millers doe appeare: But let them powder all that er'e they can, Their Pride will stinke before both God and man. There was a trades-mans wife, which I could name, (But that I'le not divulge abroad her shame) Which a strong legion of good garments wore, As gownes and petticoates, and kirtles store, Smocks, headtires, aprons, shadowes, shaparoons, (Whim whams, &amp; whirligiggs to please Baboones) Iewels, rings, ooches, brooches, bracelets, chaines; (More then too much to fit her idle braines) Besides, she payd (not counting muffes and ruffes) Foure pounds sixe shillings for two paire of cuffes. 'Twill make a man halfe mad, such wormes as those, The generall gifts of God should thus ingrosse: And that such numbers want their needfull vse, Whilst hellish Pride peruerts them to abuse. Now a few lines to paper I will put, Of mens Beards strange and variable cut: In which there's some doe take as vaine a Pride, As almost in all other things beside. Some are reap'd most sudstantiall, like a brush, Which makes a Nat'rall wit knowne by the bush: (And in my time of some men I haue heard, Whose wisedome haue bin onely wealth and beard) Many of these the prouerbe well doth fit, Which sayes Bush naturall, More haire then wit. Some seeme as they were starched stiffe and fine, Like to the bristles of some angry swine: And some (to set their Loues desire on edge) Are cut and prun'de like to a quickset hedge. Some like a spade, some like a forke, some square, Some round, some mow'd like stubble, some starke bare, Some sharpe Steletto fashion, dagger like, That may with whispering a mans eyes out pike: Some with the hammer cut, or Romane T, Their beards extrauagant reform'd must be, Some with the quadrate, some triangle fashion, Some circular, some ouall in translation, Some perpendicular in longitude, Some like a thicket for their crassitude, That heights, depths, bredths, triforme, square, ouall, round, And rules Geo'metricall in beards are found, Besides the vpper lip's strange variation, Corrected from mutation to mutation; As't were from tithing vnto tithing sent, Pride giues to Pride continuall punishment. Some (spite their teeth) like thatch'd eues downeward grows, And some growes vpwards in despite their nose. Some their mustatioes of such length doe keepe, That very well they may a maunger sweepe: Which in Beere, Ale, or Wine, they drinking plunge, And sucke the liquor vp, as't were a Spunge; But 'tis a Slouens beastly Pride, I thinke, To wash his beard where other men must drinke. And some (because they will not rob the cup, Their vpper chaps like pot hookes are turn'd vp, The Barbers thus (like Taylers) still must be, Acquainted with each cuts variety: Yet though with beards thus merrily I play, 'Tis onely against Pride which I inueigh: For let them weare their haire or their attire, According as their states or mindes desire, So as no puff'd vp Pride their hearts possesse, And they vse Gods good gifts with thankefulnesse. Against Pride of Worldly wisdome.There's many an idle shallow pated Gull, Thinks his owne wisedome to be wonderfull: And that the State themselues doe much forget, Because he in authoritie's not set: And hauing scarcely wit to rule a Cottage, Thinks he could guide a Kingdome with his dotage. True wisedome is mans onely guide and guard, To liue here, to liue better afterward. It is a rich mans chiefe preeminence, And 'tis a poore mans stay, and best defence. But worldly wisedome is the ground of all The mischiefes that to man did euer fall. Gods Wisedome is within the Gospel hid, Which we to Cor. 2. 7. search, are by our Sauiour bid. Thus Pride of humane wisedome is all vaine, And foolish fancies of mens idle braine. Against Pride of humane knowledge. Pride of our knowledge, we away must throw, For he knowes most, which least doth seeme to know: One Apple from the Tree of life is more, Then from the tree of knowledge halfe a score: 'Tis good for vs to know our Masters will, But the not doing it, makes knowledge ill. Ther's many know, the Iust in heau'n shall dwell, Yet they vniustly runne the way to hell. The life Eternall no way can be wonne, But to know God, and Iohn 17. 3. Iesus Christ his Sonne. Christ, (to his people) by his word and passion, Taught men the ioyfull Luke 1. 73. knowledge of saluation. I rather had by knowledge, raise my chance, Then to be poore with barb'rous ignorance; Yet better 'twere I nothing vnderstood, Then to know goodnesse, and to doe no good. Thus knowledge, worthy is of dignity; But not to make the knowers proud thereby. For if men would, to know themselues endeuer, Pride of their knowledge would infect them neuer. Against Pride of riches. Pride of our riches is a painefull pleasure, Like sumpter horses laden with rich treasure, So misers beare their vvealth as they are able, Till Death the hostler makes the graue their stable. There's some take pride in treasure basely got, Haue it, yet want it, as they had it not; And though to get it, no vile meanes they spare, To spend it on themselues they seldome dare; How can a base extortionizing Bore, Get riches ill, and giue God thankes therefore? Tis all one, if a thiefe, a bawde, a vvitch, Or a Bribe-taker should grovv damned rich, And for their trash, got vvith their hellish pranks, The hypocriticke slaues vvill giue God thanks. No, let the litter of such helhound vvhelps, Giue thanks to th'Deuill (author of their helpes) To giue God thanks, it is almost all one, To make him partner in extortion. Thus if men get their wealth by meanes that's euill, Let them not giue God thanks but th?ke the Deuill. Yet wealth the gift of God hath euer bin, But not such wealth that's onely got by sinne; Nor any vvealth, if men take pride therein. And those vvho pur their foolish confidence In Riches, trusting to their false defence; Those that vvith Mammon are bevvitched so, Our Sauiour 'gainst them threats a fearefull Luke 24. vvoe. Humility vvith Riches may be blest. But Pride's a poyson God doth still detest. Against Pride of Learning. Pride of our Learning's vaine, it doth appeare, For though men study many a vveary yeere, And learn'd as much, as possible the braine, Or scope of mans Inuentions may attaine, Yet after all their studies, truth doth show, Much more is vvhat they know not, then they know, To learne by bad mens vices, vice to shunne, By good mens good, vvhat should by vs be done: This is the learning vve should practise most, Not to be proud thereof, or vainely boast, Against being proud of Princes fauours.A Princes fauour is a precious thing, Yet it doth many vnto ruine bring; Because the hauers of it proudly vse it, And (to their ovvne ambitious ends) abuse it. If men that are so stately and so strange, Would but remember hovv time oft doth change, And note hovv some in former times did speed, Comparison.By their examples they vvould take some heed: For as a cart-wheele in the vvay goes round, The spoake that's high'st is quickly at the ground, So Enuy, or iust cause, or misconceit, In Princes Courts, continually doe vvaite, That he that is this day Magnifico, To morrow may goe by Ieronimo. The spoakes that now are highest in the wheeles, Are in a moment lovvest by the heeles. Haman was proud, past reasons bounds or scope, And his vaine glory ended in a rope, And his ten sonnes, in duty to obay Their father, follovved him the selfe-same vvay. Those men that harbour Pride vvithin their brest, Doe seldome end their dayes in peace and rest. But if they doe, disgrace and shame withall, Are the chiefe vvayters on their funerall. Where honour is with noble vertue mix'd, It like a rocke stands permanent and fix'd, The snares of enuy, or her traps of hate Could neuer, nor shall euer hurt that state: Like Adamant it doth beat backe the battry Of spitefull malice, and deceiuing flattry, For it with pride can neuer be infected, But humbly is supernally protected, Such with their Kings shall euer be belou'd, Against Pride of beauty.And like to fixed starres, stand fast, vnmou'd. Those that are proud of Beauty, let them know, Their Pride is but a fickle, fading show. A smoake, a bubble, a time-tossed toy, A Luna-like, fraile, euer changing ioy. For as a tide of flood, flow'd to the height, Doth (in a moment) fall to ebbing straight: So beauty, when it is most faire and fine, (Like new pluck'd flowers) doth presently decline. That man or womans vertue doth excell, If with their beauty chastity doth dwell: But Pride of beauty is a marke most sure, That th'owners of it vse to procure The Paphian pastime, and the Cyprian game, The sports of Venus, and the acts of shame, To breed the heat of Cupids lustfull flame. Oft beauty hath faire chastity displac'd, But chastity hath beauty euer grac'd. For 'tis a maxime, Those haue euer bin, That are most faire without, most foule within. Too oft hath beauty, by disloyalty, Branded it selfe with lasting infamy, That one fraile creature, (nobly well descended) (Proud of her fairenes) fouly hath offended, And on her house and kindred, laid a blot, That the dishonor ne'r will be forgot. But a faire feature vertuously inclin'd, A beauteous outside, and a pious mind, Such are Gods Images Epitomies, And Cabinets of heauens blest treasuries: And therefore be thy feature, faire or foule, Let inward vertues beautifie the soule. Against Pride of our strength. Pride of our strength, shewes weaknes in our wit, Because the Collicke, or an Ague fit, The tooth-ach, or the pricking of a pin, Oft lets the strength out, and the weaknesse in. The Tribe of Dans great glory, Iudges 16. 19. Samsons strength, By a weake woman was orethrowne at length. And sure there's many do themselues much wrong In being proud because they are made strong, For a great number liuing now there are, Can wrastle, throw the sledge, or pitch the barre, That on their backs foure hundred waight can beare, And horse-shooes (with their fists) in sunder teare, Yet neuer vse their strength in any thing, To serue their God, their Country, or their King. But with outragious acts their liues pursue, As if God gaue them strength but as their due, As though they like the Gyants could remoue, And hurle great mountaines at the head of Ioue, Or like Gargantua or Polipheme, Or Gogmagog, their boystrous fancies dreame, That they more wonders by their strength can doe, Then Hercules could e're attaine vnto. Let those Goliahs, that in strength take pride, Know that the Lord of Hostes doth them deride, And what they are (that proudly brag and swell Of strength) let any man but note them well, If hurt or sickenesse make their strength decay, A man shall neuer see such Cowes as they. Be'ng strong, their minds on God they neuer set; In weakenesse, iustly he doth them forget: Strength, thus like headstrong Iades they doe abuse it, For want of Reasons bridle how to vse it. Against Pride of our hauing children. Pride of our children's vaine; our proper stem Must either dye from vs, or we from them. If our examples of the life we liue, Inrich them not more then the gifts we giue, If (disobedient) they despise instruction, And will peruersly runne into destruction; Much better had it bin, we had not bin Begetters of such Imps of shame and sinne. Children no duty to such Parents owe, Who suffer vice their youth to ouergrow, Neglect to teach thy sonne in younger yeeres, He shall reiect thee in thy hoary haires, The way to make our children vs obay, Is that our selues from God runne not astray, Such measure to our Maker as we mete, Tis iust, that such, we from our children get. Th'Apostle Paul exhorteth more and lesse, To be all children in maliciousnesse: That is to say, as children harmeles be, So we should from maliciousnes be free. Thus Pride of birth, apparell, wealth, strength stare, And Pride of humane wisedome God doth hate: Of knowledge, learning, beauty, children and The Pride of Princes fauour cannot stand. And Pride in any thing shall euermore, Be bar'd and shut from heau'ns Eternall doore, For whosoeuer will beleeue and looke, Shall find examples in the sacred booke: That God hath euer 'gainst the proud withstood, And that a proud heart neuer came to good. He saith, Pride is Toby 4. 13. destruction, and agen That Pride is Toby 4. 13. hatefull before God and men. How Prides beginning is from God to fall. And of all sinne is the Toby 4. 13. originall. Who taketh hold on Pride, in great affliction Shall be o'rethrowne, fild with Gods malediction, Eccles. 10. Pride was not made for man, man hath no part In pride, for God Prouerbs 16. Pro. 29. Eccles. 29. Matt. 23. Luk 14. 18. Luke 1. Iudith 9. abhorreth a proud heart. And 'tis decreed by the Almighties doome, That pride vnto a fearefull fall shall come. A person that is proud, ne'r pleas'd God yet: For how can they please him whom they forget? Yet as before I said, againe He say, That pride to such a hight is growne this day. That many a thousand thousand familie, Wer't not for pride would begge, or starue and dye. And the most part of them are men of might, Who in prides quarrell will both speake and fight: I therefore haue no hope to put her downe; But Satyre-like, to tell her of her owne. There is another pride which I must touch, It is so bad, so base, so too too much: Against Libellers. Most of these Libellers haue an Itching veine of Riming, which with much scratching makes scuruy lines &amp; so from itch to scratch, from scratch to scuruy, &amp; from scuruy to scabbed they proceed in time, with their botching, to be termed (by knaues and fooles) scald Poets.Which is, if any good mans fortune be, To rise to Honourable dignitie, Or through infirmity, or wilfulnesse, Men fall vnhappily into distresse. That Libellers doe spirt their wits like froth, To raile at Honor, and dishonor both. These Mungrell whelpes are euer snarling still, Hating mens goodnesse, glorying in their ill, Like blood-hound Curs, they daily hunt and sent, And rime and Iigge on others detriment: Supposing it a very vertuous thing, To be an arrant Knaue in libelling. Forsooth these Screech-owles would be cal'd the wits, Whose flashes flye abroad by girds and fits: Who doe their mangy Muses magnifie: Making their sports of mens calamity, But yet for all their hatefull hellish mirth, They are the vilest cowards on the earth: For there's not one that doth a libell frame, Dares for his eares subscribe to it his name. Tis a base brutish pride to take a pen, And libell on the miseries of men; For why all men are mortall, weake and fraile, And all, from what they should be, fall and faile. And therefore men should in these slip'ry times Bewaile mens miseries, and hate their crimes: Let him that stands, take heed he doth not fall, And not reioyce in mens mis-haps at all. It is too much for Libellers to meddle, To make their Muse a Hangman or a Beadle: At mens misfortunes to deride and iest, To adde distresse to those that are distrest. As I doe hold mens vices to be vile, So at their miseries Ile neuer smile, And in a word (lest tediousnesse offend) A Libeller's a Knaue, and there's an end. Thus hauing of Prides various formes related, And how of God, and good men it is hated; I thinke it fit some Lines in praise to write, Of Vertues which to Pride are opposite. For vice with shew of Vertue blindes the eye, And Vertue makes vice knowne apparantly. When falsehood is examin'd and compar'd With Truth, it makes truth haue the more regard. The Crow seemes blackest, when the Swan stands neere And goodnes makes the ill most bad appeare: So vertues that are contrary to vices, Make them contemptible, and base in prices The praise of Humility.Humility, if it be well embrac'd, It makes disdainfull Pride, disdain'd, disgrac'd: Humility is a most heauenly gift, The Stayre that doth (to Glory) men vp lift. None but the meeke and lowly humbled spirit Shall true eternall happinesse inherit: Those that are humble, honour Eccles. 19.God alwayes, And onely those will he to honour raise. If thou be'st great in state, giue thanks therefore, And humble still thy selfe, so much the more. He that is humble, loues his Christian brother, And thinkes himselfe Phil. 2. 3.inferiour to all other; Those that are meeke, the Lord shall euer guide, And Psal. 25. 9.teach them in his wayes still to abide. For though the Lord be high, he hath respect Vnto the Psal.138.6lowly, whom he will protect. Humility, and lowlinesse goes on, Still before honour, (as saith Salomon) He that is humble heere and free from strife, Shall for Prou. 22. 4.reward haue glory, wealth, and life. He that himselfe doth humble, certainly, Our Sauiour saith, shall be Mat. 23. 12. exalted high. He that with Christ will weare a glorious Crowne, Must cast himselfe, (as Christ did) humbly downe. And like to the rebounding of a ball, The way to rise, must first be, low to fall. For God the Father will accept of none, That put not on the meekenes of his Sonne: If proudly, thou doe lift thy selfe on high, God and his blessings, from thee, still will fly: But if thou humble, meeke, and lowly be, God and his blessings will come downe to thee. If thou wouldst trauell vnto heau'n, then know, Humility's the way that thou must goe. If in presumptuous paths of Pride thou tread, 'Tis the right wrong way that to hell doth lead. Know that thy birth, attire, strength, beauty, place, Are giu'n vnto thee by Gods speciall grace: Know that thy wisedome, learning, and thy wealth, Thy life, thy Princes fauour, beauty, health, And whatsoeuer thou canst goodnes call, Was by Gods bounty giu'n vnto thee all. And know that of thine owne thou dost possesse Nothing but sinne, and wofull wretchednes, A Christians pride should onely be in this, When he can say that God his Father is. When grace and mercy, (vvell applide) affoord, To make him brother vnto Christ his Lord. When he vnto the holy Ghost can say, Thou art my Schoolemaster, whom I'le obay; When he can call the Saints his fellovves, and Say to the Angels, for my guard you stand, This is a laudable, and Christian pride, To knovv Christ, and to know him crucifi'd. This is that meeke ambition, lovv aspiring, Which all men should be earnest in desiring: Thus to be proudly humble, is the thing, Which vvill vs to the state of glory bring. But yet bevvare; pride hypocriticall, Puts not humilities cloake on at all: A lofty mind, vvith lovvly cap and knee, Is humble pride, and meeke hypocrisie. Ambitious mindes, vvith adulating lookes, Like courteous (Crovvne-aspiring) King Henry the fourth. Bullinbrookes, As a great ship ill suited vvith small saile, As Iudas meant all mischiefe, cride, All-haile, Like the humility of Absalon: This shadovved pride, much danger vvaites vpon. These are the counterfeite (God saue yee Sirs) That haue their flatteries in particulars, That courteously can hide their proud intents, Vnder varieties of complements, These Vipers bend the knee, and kisse the hand, And sweare, (svveet Sir) I am at your command, And proudly make humility a screvv, To vvring themselues into opinions vievv. This pride is hatefull, dangerous, and vile, And shall it selfe (at last) it selfe beguile. Thus pride is deadly sin, and sin brings shame, Which here I leaue to hell, from whence it came. FINIS. [Against Cursing and Swearing.] TO THE MOST HIGH AND ALMIGHTY God the Father, Creator of the World, and to the King of Kings, Lord of Lords, and onely Ruler of Princes, Iesus Christ, the Glorious Redeemer of the World, And to the most holy &amp; Blessed Spirit, the Comfort of all true Beleeuers, and Sanctifier of the World, Three Persons, and one Eternall Omnipotent God. TO THE HIGH AND MIGHTY MONARCH, AND MY DREAD Soueraigne, Charles, by the Grace and Prouidence of God, King of Great Britaine, France and Ireland, Defender, &amp;c. Against Swearing. Thou that these lines dost either heare or read, Consider with thy selfe, and take good heed. Reade them, and let them neuer be forgot, They doe concerne thy soule, then slight them not. The Iames. Fiends of Hell beleeue there is a God, And feare and tremble at his angry Rod: They doe confesse his glorious Excellence, And his Almighty powers Omnipotence. But Man his choisest and his chiefest Creature, Is so rebellious against God and Nature, That hee 'gainst Heau'n dare both blaspheme and sweare, And (worse then Fiends) they not beleeue or feare: So that the Earth doth breed, feed, and retaine Worse Monsters then there doth in Hell remaine. If men beleeu'd the Word that God hath spoke, They would belieue that Word shuld ne'r be btoke. In His enacted Law Exodus 20. is one Decree, That all who take his Name in vaine, shall be Accounted guilty, and his fearefull wrath Will hold them guilty of eternall death. Againe 'tis said, Let the Leuiticus 24. Balsphemer dye, Let him be stoned for his Blasphemy; And euill tongues, who dare to curse aduenter, Shall into Heauens 1 Cor. 6. 10. blessednesse not enter. And Christ (when on the Earth he liued heere) Forbade vs that at Mat. 6. all we should not sweare. And in th'leuenth of Deutoronomy againe, We are commanded not to sweare in vaine. The God himselfe complaineth that men blaspheme him, Esay, 52. 5. The names of blasphemy are writ vpon the 10. heads of Antichrist, Apoc. 13. 1. Cursing is forbidden by the Apostle, when hee saith, Blesse, I say, and curse not, Rom. 12. 14. Our Sauiour commandeth vs to blesse them that curse vs, Mat. 5. 44. Blesse them that curse you, and pray for them which hurt you, Luke 6. 28. Accustome not thy mouth to swearing, for in it are many falls, neither take vp for a custome the naming of the holy One, for thou shalt not be vnpunished for such things Eccle. 23. 9. The Plague shall neuer goe forth from the house of the swearer, Idem. Who so sweares falsely, calls the God of truth to witnesse a lie. Who so sweares as he thinks, may be deceiued. Who so sweares vnreuerently, dishonoureth God. Whoso sweares deceitfully, abuseth Christian fidelity. Whoso sweares idlely, abuseth the credit of a faithfull oath. Whoso sweares accustomably, God will plague him, Elfred an English Earle, conspiring to put out K. Adelstanes eyes at Winchester, forsware the treason in St. Peters Church at Rome. and fell downe dead presently. Godwin murthered Prince Alfred, brother to King Edward Confessor, and being at dinner, the King charged him with the murther, then Godwin swore by bread, &amp; prayed it might choak him, if he were guilty: and immediatly it choaked him in the place: his lands also sunke into the sea, and are called Godwin sands. King Stephen forsware himselfe to King Henry I. and liued in continuall trouble, and dyed in perplexity of minde Edward the 4. brake his oath made at Yorke, that he came not with intent to seaze the Kingdome, and breaking that oath, was punisht with a troublesome raigne, his brethren and children all (except one) murthered and not any of his issue raigned after him. Roger Mortimer, a great Peere of this Land, for breaking his oath to King Edward the II. was most ignominiously hanged, boweld and quartred. M. Fox in his Booke of Martyrs declares of one Richard Long of Calice, that forsware himselfe, to accuse one Smith for eating flesh in Lent: after which oath Long went presently and drowned himselfe. One Grimwood at Hitcham in Suffolke, forsware himselfe, and his bowels burst out. One Widdow Barnes for the like sinne cast herselfe out of her window in Cornhill and brake her necke. Anne Auertis forsware herselfe in Woodstreet for six pounds of Towe, desiring God she might sinke downe, which fearefully hapned. One Lea in Sunne-alley without Bishops-gate forsware himselfe, and after ript out his guts. Heathen to blaspheme their gods abhorr'd, Yet Christians wilfully blaspheme the Lord. Who-euer to reuile the gods were knowne, In Rome, were from the Rock Tarpeius throwne. Th'Egyptians Law was, he should lose his head, 'Mongst Scythians, life and goods were forfeited. These grieuous punishments did Pagans vse Against all them that did their gods abuse. King Donald's Law in Scotland's not forgot, Who burnt them through the lips with irons hot. And when King Edmund here had Regall State, All Swearers he did excommunicate. And Philip King of France (a Prince renown'd) Ordain'd that Blasphemers should be drown'd. The Emperour Maximilian did decree, That all vaine Swearers should beheaded be. The Earle of Flanders, Philip, did ordaine, Their losse of life and goods that swore in vaine. Saint Lewis the King of France enacted there, That for the first time any one did sweare, Into imprisonment one month was cast, And stand within the Pillory at last. But if the second time againe they swore, One with an iron hot their tongues did bore. And who the third time in that fault did slip, Were likewise boared through the vnder-lip. For the fourth time most grieuous paines belongs, He caus'd to be cut off their lips and tongues. Henry the fift of England, that good King, His Court to such conformity did bring, That euery Duke should forty shillings pay For euery Oath he swore, without delay. Each Baron twenty, Knights or Squires offence Paid tenne: and euery Yeoman twenty pence. The Boyes and Pages all were whipt most fine, That durst abuse the Maiestie diuine. Thus Pagan Princes with sharp lawes withstood Profaning of their Gods, of stone, or wood. And Christian Kings and Rulers formerly, Haue most seuerely punisht blasphemy. And shall a Heathen, or an Infidell, That knowes no ioyes of Heauen, or paines of Hell, More reuerence to his deuillish Idols show, Then we doe to the true God whom we know? If we remembred well but what we were, And what we are, we would not dare to sweare. Poore trunks of earth fill'd with vncertaine breath, By nature heires to euerlasting death: Most miserable wretches, most ingrate 'Gainst God, that did elect vs, and create. Redeem'd, conseru'd, preseru'd, and sanctifi'd, And giues vs hope we shall be glorifi'd. H'hath giuen vs being, life, sense, reason, wit, Wealth, and all things his Prouidence thinkes fit: And for requitall, (we quite voyde of grace) Curse, sweare, and doe blaspheme him to his face. Oh the supernall patience of our God, That beares with Man (a sin polluted clod) When halfe such treasons 'gainst an earthly King, Would many a Traytor to confusion bring! Suppose a man should take a Whelp and breed him, And stroke him, &amp; make much of him, &amp; feed him, How will that curre loue him beyond all other? Neuer forsaking him to serue another? But if he should most disobediently, Into his Masters face or throat to fly, Sure euery man that liues vpon the ground, Would say a hanging's fit for such a hound. And worser then so many dogges are they That 'gainst their God with oathes do barke &amp; bray. And if repentance doe not mercy win, They'll hang in Hell like Hell-hounds for that sin. Of all black crimes from Belzebubs damn'd treasure, This swearing sin no profit yeelds, or pleasure: Nor gaines the swearer here but earths vexation, With change of his saluation for damnation. It is a sinne that yeelds vs no excuse. (For what excuse can be for Gods abuse?) And though our other faults by death doe end, Yet Blasphemy doth after death extend, For to the damn'd in Hell this curse is giuen, They far their paines blaspheme the God of Heauen. Examples on the earth haue many beene, As late in sundry places haue beene seene. At Mantua two braue Ruffians in their games Swore and blasphem'd our blessed Sauiours name, Where Gods iust iudgement (full of feare &amp; dread) Caus'd both their eyes to drop from out their head. In Rome, a childe but fiue yeeres old that swore, Was snatcht vp by the Deuill, and seene no more. And at Ragouse, a Mariner did sweare, As if he would Gods name in sunder teare; When falling ouer-boord, was drown'd and tost, And nothing but his tongue was onely lost. Remember this, you sinfull sonnes of men, Thinke how that Christ redeem'd you from Hells den: His mercy he hath giu'n in magnitude, Requite him not with vile ingratitude. He made the Eares and Eye, and heares and sees The swearers execrable oathes and lyes. The Godhead of the Father they contemne: Against the Sonnes Redemption they blaspheme: The Holy Spirit grieuously they grieue, And headlong into Hell themselues they driue, It is in vaine for mortall men to thinke, Gods Iustice is asleepe, although it winke: Or that his arme is shortned in these times, That he cannot reach home to punish crimes. Oh thinke not so, 'tis but the Deuils illusion, To draw vs desperately to our confusion. Some say that 'tis their anger makes them sweare, And oathes are out before they are aware, But being crost with losses and perplex'd, They thinke no harme, but sweare as being vex'd: And some there are that sweare for complement, Make oathes their grace, and speeches ornament, Their sweete Rhetoricall fine eloquence, Their reputations onely excellence, Their valour, whom the Deuill doth inflame T'abuse their Makers and Redeemers Name. Thinke but on this, you that doe God forget, Your poore excuses cannot pay this debt: Remember that our sinfull soules did cost A price too great, to be by swearing lost. And blessed was our last good Parliament, Who made an Act for swearers punishment, And blest shall be each Magistrates good name, That carefully doe execute the same. Those that are zealous for Gods glory here, (No doubt) in Heauen shall haue true glory there, Which that we may haue, humbly I implore Of Him that rules and raignes for euermore, Th'Eternall Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, Before whose Throne blest Saints and Angels sings, All power, praise, glory, Maiesty, thankesgiuing, Ascribed be to him that's euer liuing. FINIS. [THE FEAREFVLL SVMMER: OR LONDONS CALAMITIE.] TO THE TRVELY GENEROVS' AND NOBLE KNIGHT, SIR Iohn Millissent, SERIEANT PORTER TO the Kings most Excellent Maiestie. Right worthy Knight, when first this Booke I writ To You, I boldely Dedicated it: And hauing now enlarg'd both Prose and Rime, To you J offer it the second time. To whom should I these sorrowes recommend, But vnto You, the Cities Noble Friend? I know, you are much grieued with their Griefe, And would aduenture Life for their reliefe: To You therefore these Lines I Dedicate, Wherein, their Sorrowes partly J relate, I humbly craue acceptance at your hand: And rest Your Seruant euer at command, Iohn Taylor. THE FEAREFULL SUMMER: OR LONDONS CALAMITIE THE PRAEFACE. In this lamentable time of generall Calamity, our hainous sinnes prouoking Gods iust Indignation, this heauy visitation and mortality; I being attendant vpon the Queenes Maiestie at Hampton-Court, and from thence within two miles of Oxford with her Barge (with much griefe &amp; remorse) did see and heare miserable and cold entertainement of many Londoners; which, for their preseruation fled and retired themselues from the City into the Country. Whence I noted the peoples Charity, and great amendment, for they had giuen ouer one of the seuen deadly sinnes, which was Couetousnesse, and in many places were so farre out of loue of a Citizens money, that they abhor'd and hated either to touch or receiue it; entertaining them with bitter worme-wood welcome, (which hearbe was in more request amongst many of them, then any of the heauenly Graces or Cardinall Vertues) yet the hearbe of Grace was in much estimation, although the name of it was a document that they had occasion to Rue the Time; I further perceiued that they were so farre from beleeuing or crediting any man, that they would or durst not trust their owne noses, but were doubtfull, that that sence would conspire with the Plague to murther them, wherefore (like cunning Mariners, or mole-catchers,) they would craftily in their streetes and high-wayes fetch the wind of any man, although they were ouer shooes &amp; boots, &amp; sometimes tumbled into a ditch for their labours. This was the time when a man with a night-cap at noone, would haue frighted a whole Parish out of their wits, when to call for Aqua-vitæ (though it had bin but to make a drench for a sicke horse) was enough to haue his house shut vp. When Lord haue mercy vpon vs, made many of them tremble more then God Refuse, Renounce, Confound, or Damne. When a man trauailing in the habit of a Citizen, was a meere Bulbegger; when for a man to say that hee came from Hell, would yeed him better well-come without money, then one would giue to his owne father and mother that came from London. In this time of mans great misery and small mercy, I tooke my pen in hand and wrote this ensuing discourse: I haue (as neere as I could) suited it sadly, according to the nature of the subiect. And truly, because that the bare and naked truth was so cleare and ample, that I need not to stuffe it out with friuolous fables or fantasticall fictions; with my soule, I thankefully aeknowledge Gods great mercy extended towards mee (one of the most wretched and wicked) in that so many thousands of better life and conuersation, haue fallen on my right hand and on my left, and round about me; yet hath his gracious protection beene my guard, for the which in my gratitude to my God, and to auoyd the sinne of idlenesse, I haue written, what those that can, may reade. The Patience and long suffering of our God, Keepes close his Quiuer, and restraines his Rod, And though our crying Crimes to Heau'n doe cry For vengeance, on accurst Mortality; Yea though we merit mischiefes manifold, Blest Mercy doth the hand of Iustice hold. But when that Eye that sees all things most cleare, Expects our fruits of Faith, from yeere, to yeere, Allowes vs painefull Pastors, who bestow Great care and toyle, to make vs fruitfull grow, And daily doth in those weake Vessels send The dew of Heauen, in hope we will amend; Yet (at the last) he doth perceiue and see That we vnfruitfull and most barren be, Which makes his indignation frowne, And (as accursed Fig-trees) cut vs downe. Thus Mercy (mock'd) plucks Iustice on our heads, And grieuous Plagues our Kingdome ouerspreads: Then let vs to our God make quicke returning, With true contrition, fasting and with mourning: The Word is God, and God hath spoke the Word, If we repent he will put vp his sword. Hee's grieu'd in punishing, Hee's slow to Ire, And HE a sinners death doth not desire. If our Compunction our Amendment show, Our purple sinnes Hee'll make as white as snow. If we lament our God is mercifull, Our scarlet crimes hee'll make as white as wooll. Faire London that did late abound in blisse, And wast our Kingdomes great Metropolis, 'Tis thou thar art deiected, low in state, Disconsolate, and almost desolate, (The hand of Heau'n that onely did protect thee) Thou hast prouok'd most iustly to correct thee, And for thy pride of Heart and deeds vniust, He layes thy Pompe and Glory in the dust. Thou that wast late the Queene of Cities nam'd, Throughout the world admir'd, renown'd, &amp; fam'd: Thou that hadst all things at command and will, To whom all England was a hand-maide still; For rayment, fewell, fish, fowle, beasts, for food, For fruits, for all our Kingdome counted good, Both neere and farre remote, all did agree To bring their best of blessings vnto thee. Thus in conceite, thou seem'dst to rule the Fates, Whilst peace and plenty flourish'd in thy Gates, Could I relieue thy miseries as well, As part I can thy woes and sorrowes tell, Then should my Cares be eas'd with thy Reliefe, And all my study how to end thy griefe. Thou that wer't late rich, both in friends &amp; wealth, Magnificent in state, and strong in health, As chiefest Mistris of our Country priz'd, Now chiefly in the Country art despis'd. The name of London now both farre and neere, Strikes all the Townes and Villages with feare, And to be thought a Londoner is worse, Then one that breakes a house, or takes a purse. He that will filch or steale, now is the Time, No Iustice dares examine him, his crime; Let him but say that he from London came, So full of Feare and Terrour is that name, The Constable his charge will soone forsake, And no man dares his Mittimus to make. Thus Citizens plagu'd for the Citie sinnes, Poore entertainement in the Country winnes. Some feare the City, and fly thence amaine, And those are of the Country fear'd againe, Who 'gainst th? bar their windows &amp; their doores, More then they would 'gainst Turks, or Iewes or Moores, I thinke if very Spaniards had come there, Their well-come had bin better, and their cheare. Whilst Hay-cock lodging, with hard slender fare, Welcome like dogs vnto a Church they are, Feare makes them with the Anabaptists ioyne, For if an Hostesse doe receiue their coyne, She in a dish of water, or a paile, Will new baptize it, lest it something aile. Thus many a Citizen well stor'd with gold, Is glad to lye vpon his mother mold, His bed the map of his mortality, His curtaines clouds, aud Heau'n his Canopy. The russet Plow-swaine, and the Leathren Hinde, Through feare is growne vnmannerly, vnkinde: And in his house (to harbour) hee'll prefer An Infidell before a Londoner: And thus much friendship Londoners did win, The Deuill himselfe had better welcome bin: Those that with trauell were tir'd, faint, and dry, For want of drinke, might starue, &amp; choke, and dye: For why the hob-nail'd Boores, inhumane Blocks, Vncharitable Hounds, hearts hard as Rocks, Did suffer people in the field to sinke, Rather then giue, or sell a draught of drinke. Milke-maides &amp; Farmers wiues are growne so nice, They thinke a Citizen a Cockatrice, And Country Dames, are wax'd so coy and briske, They shun him as they'll shun a Basiliske: For euery one the sight of him would flye, All fearing he would kill them with his eye. Ah wofull London, I thy griefe bewayle, And if my sighes and prayers may but preuaile; I humbly beg of God that hee'le be pleas'd, In Iesus Christ, his wrath may be appeas'd, With-holding his dread Iudgements from aboue, And once more graspe thee in his armes of loue. In mercy all our wickednes remit, For who can giue thee thankes within the pit? Strange was the change in lesse then 3. months space, In ioy, in woe, in grace, and in disgrace: A healthfull Aprill, a diseased Iune, And dangerous Iuly, brings all out of tune. That City whose rare obiects pleas'd the eyes With much content and more varieties, She that was late delightfull to the eares, With melody Harmonious, like the Spheares: She that had all things that might please the scent, And all she felt, did giue her touch content, Her Cinque Port scences, richly fed and cloyd With blessins bountifull, which she enioy'd. Now 3. monthes change hath fill'd it full of feare, As if no Solace euer had beene there. What doe the Eyes see there but grieued sights Of sicke, oppressed, and distressed wights? Houses shut vp, some dying, and some dead, Some (all amazed,) flying, and some fled. Streets thinly man'd with wretches euery day, Which haue no power to flee, or meanes to stay, In some whole streete (perhaps) a Shop or twayne Stands open, for small takings, and lesse gaine. And euery closed window, dore and stall, Makes each day seeme a solemne Festiuall. Dead Coarses carried, and recarried still, Whilst fifty Corpses scarce one graue doth fill. With Lord have mercie vpon vs, on the dore, Which (though the words be good) doth grieue men sore. And o're the doore-posts fix'd a crosse of red Betokening that there Death some blood hath shed. Some with Gods markes or Tokens doe espie, Those Marks or Tokens, shew them they must die. Some with their Carbuncles, and sores new burst, Are fed with hope they haue escap'd the worst: Thus passeth all the weeke, till Thursdayes Bill Shews vs what thousands death that weeke did kil. That fatall Bill, doth like a razor cut The dead, the liuing in a maze doth put, And he that hath a Christian heart, I know, Is grieu'd, and wounded with the deadly blow. These are the obiects of the Eye, now heare And marke the mournefull musicke of the Eare; There doe the brazen Iron tongu'd loud bells (Deaths clamorous musicke) ring continuall knells, Some lofty in their notes, some sadly towling, Whilst fatall dogs made a most dismall howling, Thus it was in Iune, Iuly, August and September.Some franticke rauing, some with anguish crying, Some singing, praying, groaning, and some dying, The healthfull grieuing, and the sickly groaning, All in a mournefull diapason moaning. Here, Parents for their Childrens losse lament. There, Childrens griefe for Parents life that's spent: Husbands deplore their louing Wiues decease: Wiues for their Husbands weepe remedilesse: The Brother for his Brother, friend for friend, Doe each for other mutuall sorrowes spend, Here, Sister mournes for Sister, Kin for Kin, As one grife ends, another doth begin: There one lies languishing, with slender fare: Small comfort, lesse attendance. and least care, With none but Death and he to tugge together, Vntill his corps and soule part each from either. In one house one, or two, or three doth fall, And in another Death playes sweepe-stake all. Thus vniuersall sorrowfull complaining; Is all the musicke now in London raigning, Thus is her comfort sad Calamitie, And all her Melodie is Maladie. These are the obiects of the eyes and eares, Most wofull sights, and sounds of griefes and feares. The curious tast that whilome did delight With cost and care to please the Appetite What she was wont to hate, she doth adore, And what's high priz'd, she held despis'd before, The drugs, the drenches, and vntoothsome drinks, Feare giues a sweetnes to all seuerall stinks, And for supposed Antidotes, each Palate Of most contagious weedes will make a Sallate, And any of the simplest Mountebankes May cheat them (as they will) of Coine &amp; thankes, With scraped pouder of a shooing-horne, Which they'le beleeue is of an Vnicorne. Angelicaes, distastfull roote is gnaw'd, And hearbe of Grace most Ruefully is chaw'd. Garlick offendeth neither tast, nor smell, Feare and opinion makes it rellish well, Whilst Beazer stone, and mighty Mithridate, To all degrees are great in estimate, And Triacles power is wonderously exprest, And Dragon Water in most high reque'st. These 'gainst the Plague are good preseruatiues, But the best cordiall is t'amend our liues. Sinne's the maine cause and we must first begin To cease our griefes, by ceasing of our sinne. I doe beleeue that God hath giuen in store Good medicines to cure, or ease each sore, But first remoue the cause of the disease, And then (no doubt but) the effect will cease. Our sinn's the Cause, remoue our sinnes from hence, And God will soone remoue the Pestilence, Then euery med'cine (to our consolation) Shall haue his power, his force his operation, And till that time, experiments are not But Paper walls against a Cannon shot. On many a post I see Quacke-saluers Bills Like Fencers Challenges, to shew their skills: As if they were such Masters of defence That they dare combat with the Pestilence; Meete with the plague in any deadly fray, And bragge to beare the victory away, But if their patients patiently beleeue them, They'le cure them (without faile) of what they giue them; What though ten thousands by their dr?ches perish They made them purposely themselues to cherish, Their Art is a meere Artlesse kind of lying. To picke their liuing out of others dying. This sharpe inuectiue no way seemes to touch The learn'd Physician, whom I honour much, The Paracelsians and the Galennists, The Philosophicall graue Herbalists. These I admire and reuerence, for in those God doth dame Natures secrets fast inclose, Which they distribute, as occasion serue Health to reserue, and health decai'd conserue. 'Tis 'gainst such Rat-catchers I bend my pen Which doe mechanically murther men, Whose promises of cure, (like lying knaues) Doth begger men, or send them to their graues. Feeling.Now London, for the sence of feeling next, Thou in thy feeling chiefely art perplext: Thy heart feeles sorrow, and thy body anguish, Thou in thy feeling feel'st thy force to languish, Thou feel'st much woe, and much calamity, And many millions feele thy misery: Thou feel'st the fearefull Plague, the Flix, and Feuer, Which many a soule doth from the body seuer. And I beseech God for our Sauiours merit, To let thee feele, the Comfort of his Spirit. Last for the solace of the Smeling. smell or scent: Some in contagious roomes are closely pen't, Whereas corrupted Aire they take, and giue Till time ends, or lends liberty to liue. One with a piece of tasseld well tarr'd Rope, Doth with that nose-gay keepe himselfe in hope; Another doth a wispe of worme-wood pull, And with great Iudgement crams his nostrils full; A third takes off his socks from's sweating feete, And makes them his perfume alongst the streete: A fourth hath got a pownc'd Pommander box, With woorme-wood iuice, or sweating of a Fox, Rue steep'd in vineger, they hold it good To cheere the sences, and preserue the blood. Whilst Billets Bonefire-like, and faggots dry Are burnt i'th streetes, the Aire to purifie. Thou great Almightie, giue them time and space, And purifie them with thy heauenly Grace, Make their repentance Incense, whose sweet sauour May mount vnto thy Throne, and gaine thy fauour. Thus euery sence, that should the heart delight, Are Ministers, and organs to affright. The Citizens doe from the City runne. The Countries feares, the Citizens doe shunne: Both feare the Plague, but neither feares one iot The euill wayes which hath the plague begot. This is the way this sickenes to preuent Feare to offend, more then the punishment. All trades are dead, or almost out of breath But such as liue by sickenesse or by death The Mercers, Grocers, Silk-men, Goldsmiths, Drapers, Are out of Season, like noone burning Tapers, All functions faile almost, through want of buyers: And euery art and mysterie turne Dyers, The very Water-men giue ouer plying, Their rowing tade doth faile, they fall to dying. Some men there are, that rise by others falls Propheticke Augurists in vrinals, Those are right water-men, and rowe so well, They either land their fares in Heau'n or Hell. I neuer knew them yet, to make a stay And land at Purgatory, by the way: The Reason very plainely doth appeare Their patients feele their Purgatory here. But this much (Reader) you must vnderstand They commonly are paid before they land. Next vnto him th'Apothecarie thriues By Physicke bills, and his preseruatiues: Worme-eaten Sextons, mighty gaines doe wiune, And nasty Graue-makers great commings in. And Coffin-makers are well paid their rent, For many a woefull woodden tenement, For which the Trunk-makers in Pauls Church-yard, A large Reuenue this sad yeere haue shar'd Their liuing Customers for Trunkes were fled, They now made chests or Coffins for the dead. The Searchers of each corps good gainers be, The Bearers haue a profitable fee, And last, the Dog-killers great gaines abounds For Brayning brawling currs, and foisting hounds. These are the graue trades, that doe get and saue Whose grauity brings many to their graue. Thus grieued London, fil'd with mones and grones Is like a Golgotha of dead mens bones: The field where death his bloudy fray doth fight And kild a thousand in a day and night. Faire houses, that were late exceeding deare, At fifty or an hundred pounds a yeare, The Landlords are so pittifull of late Theyle let them at a quarter of the rate. So he that is a mightie moneyed man, Let him but thither make what haste he can, Let him disburse his gold and siluer heape. And purchase London 'tis exceeding cheape, But if he tarrie but one three months more, I hope 'twill be as deare as 'twas before. A Country cottage, that but lately went At foure markes, or at three pounds yeerely rent. A Citizen, whose meere necessity Doth force him now into the Country fly, Is glad to hire two Chambers of a Carter And pray &amp; pay with thankes fiue Pounds a quarter. Then here's the alteration of this yeare The Citties cheapenes makes the Country deare. Besides another mischiefe is, I see A man dares not be sicke although he be: Let him complaine but of the stone or gout The plague hath strooke him, presently they doubt. My selfe hath beeue perplexed now and then, With the wind Collick, yeeres aboue thrice ten, Wh'ch in the Country I durst not repeate Although my pangs &amp; gripes, &amp; paines were great. For to be sicke of any kind of griefe Would make a man worse welcome then a thiefe, To be drunke sicke, which er'st did credit winne, Was feat'd infectious, and held worse then sinne. This made me, and a many more beside, Their griefes to smother, and their paines to hide, To tell a mery tale with Visage glad, When as the Collick almost made me mad. Thus meere dissembling, many practis'd then, And mid'st of paine, seem'd pleasant amongst men, For why, the smallest sigh or grone, or shrieke Would make a man his meat and lodging seeke. This was the wretched Londoners hard case Most hardly welcome into any place, Whil'st Country people, where so'ere they went Would stop their Noses to auoid their sent, When as the case did oft most plaine appeare 'Twas onely they themselues that stunke with feare. Nature was dead (or from the Country runne) A Father durst not entertaine his Sonne, The Mother sees her Daughter, and doth feare her, Commands her, on her blessing not come neere her. Affinity, nor any kinde of Kinne, Or ancient friendship could true welcome winne, The Children scarcely would their Parents know Or (did if they,) but slender duty shew: Thus feare made nature most vnnaturall, Duty vndutifull, or very small, No friendship, or else cold and miserable, And generally all vncharitable. Nor London Letters little better sped They would not be receiu'd (much lesse be read) But cast into the fire and burnt with speed As if they had bin Hereticks indeed. And late I saw vpon a Sabbath day Some Citizens at Church prepar'd to pray, But (as they had bin excommunicate) The good Church-ward?s thrust them out the gate. Another Country vertue I'le repeat, The peoples charity was growne so great That whatsoeuer Londoner did dye, In Church or Church-yard should not buried lye. Thus were they scorn'd, despised, banished, Excluded from the Church, aliue, and dead, Aliue, their bodies could no harbour haue, And dead, not be allow'd a Christian Graue: Thus was the Countryes kindnesse cold, and small, No house, no Church, no Christian buriall. Oh thou that on the winged windes dost sit And seest our misery, remedy it, Although we haue deseru'd thy vengeance hot, Yet in thy fury (Lord) consume vs not. But in thy mercies sheath thy slaying sword, Deliuer vs, according to thy word, Shut vp thy Quiuer, stay thy angry rod That all the world may know thou art our God, Oh open wide the gate of thy compassion Assure our soules that thou art our Saluation. Then all our thoughts, &amp; words, &amp; works, wee'le frame To magnifie thy great and glorious Name, The wayes of God are intricate, no doubt Vnsearchable, and passe mans finding out, He at his pleasure worketh wond'rous things And in his hand doth hold the hearts of Kings, And for the loue, which to our King he beares, By sickenes he our sinfull Country cleares, That he may be a Patrone, and a guide Vnto a people purg'd and purifi'd. This by a president is manifest; When famous late Elizabeth deceast, Before our gracious Iames put on the Crowne, Gods hand did cut superfluous branches downe, Not that they then that were of life bereft, Were greater sinners then the number left: But that the Plague should then the Kingdome cleare The good to comfort, and the bad to feare: That as a good King, God did vs assure, So he should haue a Nation purg'd and pure. And as Elizabeth when she went hence, Was wayted on, as did beseeme a Prince: Of all degrees to tend her Maiestie, Neere forty thousand in that yeere did dye, That as she was belou'd of high and lowe: So at her death, their deaths their loues did showe, Whereby the world did note Elizabeth, Was louingly attended after death. So mighty Iames (the worlds admired mirour) True faiths defending friend, sterne Foe to Errour, When he Great Britains glorious Crown did leaue, A Crowne of endlesse glory to receaue, Then presently in lesse then eight months space Full eighty thousand follow him a pace. And now that Royall Iames intombed lyes, And that onr gracious Charles his roome supplies, As Heau'n did for his Father formerly A sinfull Nation cleanse and purifie. So God, for him these things to passe doth bring, And mends the subiects for so good a King. Vpon whose Throne may peace and plenty rest, And he and his Eternally be blest. FINIS. [THE TRAVELS OF TWELVE-PENCE.] TO ALL THOSE THAT HAVE BEENE, ARE, VVILL, OR WOVLD BE MASTERS OF A SHILLING OR TWELVE-PENCE. THE TRAVELS OF TVVELVE-PENCE. In this poem footnotes are anchored in the text. Where anchors and footnotes do not correspond, no attempt has been made to match them. Imagine Reader (to his griefe and glory,) Twelue-pence himselfe declares his wandring story: Relating how he first was borne and bred, And how about the world he Trauailed. If any one (as I dare boldly done) No man dares confesse his whole life and actions, as my Twelue-pence doth.His Bitth, his breeding, and his Life declare: Let him appeare, and I dare lay my necke, He wil be hang'd, or else deserue a checke. From vast America's rude barbarous bounds, Where the best metals doe grow, the Earth is most barren, which is an Emblem that they that hoord or hide money, are batren of all fruits of goodnesse.From rocky barren soyle, and sterill grounds, Where men did not their Creator know, And where the Deuil's the God to whom they bow, There from my Heathen Dam, or mother Earth With Paines and trauaile, I at first had birth. A hundred strong men-midwiues, digg'd their way Into her bowels, to finde where I lay With Engines, Spades, Crowes, Mattocks, &amp; such matters, They ripp'd &amp; tore her harmlesse wombe to tatters, And but they did within the mid-way catch me, They would haue dig'd to Hell it selfe to fetch me. At last they found me, mixt with dirt and drosse, Corruption vnrefin'd, eclipst my Glosse, And from the Earth I in the fire was tride, And into Ingots purg'd and Purchase. purifide. From Polidore Virgil. Menes might be first inuentor of Coine in Egypt, yet not of a Twelue pence, but I thinke money was in Cains time, and I am sure that Abraham bought a field for buriall with money. Paphlagonia, some my birth doe count, Neere Sandracugium, a most famous Mount, And that poore Slaues which were c?demn'd to die, Were forc'd to digge for me laboriously, Whereas the dampish Mines infecting ayre Kill'd the poore wretches, and so eas'd their care. Some say that Polidore Virgil. Menes might be first inuentor of Coine in Egypt, yet not of a Twelue pence, but I thinke money was in Cains time, and I am sure that Abraham bought a field for buriall with money. Menes, an Egyptian King, Me to the shape of Coyne, at first did bring: But when they saw that people, greedily, For me did runne into all villany, The Priests did curse the King, that first inuented Me, that so many wayes their mindes tormented, For till they knew me, they affirmed true; No Enuie, Pride, or Auarice they knew. Thus with great labour, and the death of men, I first was borne and afterwards agen He that to Money did conuert me first, Was by the Priests and People, bann'd and curst. With blood and curses I at first began, And euer since haue beene a curse to man. Yet for me some excuses may be showne, The name of Twelue-pence, was as then not knowne, Diuersity of Coynes o're all the world Were scatter'd vniuersally, and hurld, In Courts, in Cities, and in warlike Campes, E're I was made, they all vs'd other stamps. There were some Sicles, some A small Piece of Spanish Coyne, site of them to an English penny. Meruiades, An As, a Drachma, a Sesterties, Quadrens, Sextanes, Minaes, (it appeares) Didrachmaes, and Sportulas, and Denieres. My name at first did from the Romanes come, (As Cooper saies) they call'd me Solidum, Or from a Souldier it was named thus, (As 'twere his daily wages) Sollidus, For though the Times are subiect to mutation, Yet from Soldafus I haue nomination: Thus Twelue-pence hath an ancient Warriour bin, Although men know not when I did begin. And by experience all the world can tell, Soldatus doth loue Sollidus so well, That alwaies euery Souldier is vnwilling, Long to be kept asunder from a Shilling: If he doth want me, a moneth, two, or Souldiers wanting their pay, will want good will to serue. three, Hee'll grumble, and goe neere to Mutinie. He hath no mind to draw his Sword and fight, But (discontented) bids the warres good-night. When let but Sollidus come to his hand, Hee'll fight as long as he can goe or stand, Regarding nor remembring child or wife, Hee'll hazard and endanger limbe and life. And thus by way of argument 'tis pend, A Shilling is a Souldiers loued friend. A Shilling's much more ancient then a pound, And in pronouncing giues a better sound: As for example; which is most mouth-filling Of fifty pounds, or of a thousand shilling, A thousand pounds, may make the accent rore, But twenty thousand shillings soundeth more. Thus of two sillables I am compacted, When into one the hounds are all extracted. The Germane Dollers are my Iuniers farre, So are the Copesticks of the Brabander. The Spanish Royall, piece of foure and eight, On me for my antiquity may waite, The Floren, Guelder, and French Cardecue To me are vpstarts, if Records be true, The Grosh, A brasse piece of Bohemian coyne. twelue of them to a penny.Potchandle, Stiuer, Doyte, and Sowse, Compar'd with me, are all scarce worth a Lowse: Nor can the Atcheson or the Baubee For my antiquity compare with me. The halfe Crowne is on horseback mounted hie, Yet neuer trauail'd halfe so farre as I; The Scotish Mark's a dang'rous piece of Coyne, Tis iust a hanging price, if one purloyne, There is no such hazard in the stealing mee, I am three halfe pence lower in degree, And as in pence I for a Iury stand, The Anatomy of Twelue-pence or a shilling.I haue eleuen Coynes vnder my command: And (to grace all the rest) my proper selfe, Like a Grand Iury-man make vp the Twelfe. But for men shall not thinke I bragge or prate, Those whom I doe command 'Ile nominate. Nine pence (three quarters) with his Harpe befriends me, And six pence with halfe seruice still attends me, The foure pence halfe-penny next comes fiddling on, The Groat my third part doth depend vpon: The three-pence is a quarter wayter still, The two-pence is six parts attends my will, Three-halfe-pence stoops to my commanding sway, And eight of them at once doth me obey: The single pence are all my little Cozens, And doth attend my seruice by the dozens. Three farthings by sixteens attend in plenty, And halfe-pence to the summe of foure and twenty, And last (for Pages) on my State doth waite, Of dapper farthing tokens forty eight. But e're I did attaine my shape and forme, I'abid the brunt of many a furious storme; For this the world I would haue well to wot, Mine honour was with paines and danger got. I past the raging seas and flaming fire: And gain'd a Face and Crosse for all my hire: It would almost dissolue a heart of flint, To be so vs'd as I was in the Mint: The paines of Purgatory cannot be But fictions to those things that fell on me. For what I did endure, had man but felt, It had (like Kitchinstuffe) haue made him melt. Then my Tormentors, all at once agrees From my great heat, to let me coole or freeze, And dead and cold, me then againe they martyr'd, Me all in pieces they becut and quartir'd, Weighing the mangled mammocks, they pronounce That fiue of me in weight should be an Fiue shillings weight an ounce. ounce. Then to the Anuill was I brought in haste, Whereas with Hammers they did me bumbaste, And there they neuer left belab'ring mee, Vntill they brought me to the shape you see. Thus I mine honour, and my forme did win, Through many dreadfull dangers I was in. And though there scarce doth memory remaine, What I was e're the sixt King Edwards raigne, Yet long before his time I was in value, As read in good true written Stories shall you. My stamp (when Rome did keepe the world in awe) Was foure swift Steedes that did a Chariot draw, Which figur'd, that I to and fro should runne An endlesse Iourney that would ne'r be done. I am made endlesse, round, which doth portend, Till the world end, my Iourney ne'r shall end. And men may plainely in my roundnesse see, An Emblem of the worlds rotundity. Round is the Globe, round is the Hemisphere, Rond runs the Moon and Sun, each month and yeere: Round ran the Empire from th'Assirian Kings, Round vnto Persian, Greece, and Rome it flings, Round to great Britaine, it is come I know, Whence (hem'd round with the Sea) it cannot goe. But the maine cause that makes it stay and stand, Is where'tis guarded by th'Almighties hand. Round from the North to East, to South and West, All Arts Laue still runne round, tis manifest. The Iowes, th'Egyptians, Caldies, Persians, Deuis'd Arts, and were Astrologians, And true experience doth approue it thus, Their knowledge is runne round from them to vs. The age of man goes round, a child at first, And like a child returnes vnto his dust. His body and his limbs, his eyes, his head, All inround formes are made and fashioned, The roots, the fruits, the flowers, and the Trees, All in a round conformity agrees, Our drinking healths run round, with nimble quicknes, Vntill at last too many healths brings sickenes: When store of money to mens hands doe come, They say they haue receiu'd a good round summe; And when a man doth take a Knaue vp soundly, 'Tis said, he told him of his faults most roundly. The Hang-man hangs a Traytor, or a Thiefe, And is about his businesse round, and briefe. Round are the dishes where we put our meate, Our Cups, wherein we drinke, are round compleat: Round is our Butter, round our Cheeses are, Ro?d are the cloaths which on our backs we weare, Beasts, fowles and fish, that euery where abound, Are (for the most part) euery where made round. Round are all wedding Rings, implying will, Mens cares runne round, like horses in a mill. Thus hauing plainely shew'd, why and wherefore I am made round, now to my taske once more. About my circle, I a Posie haue, The Title, God vnto the King first gaue. The circle that encompasseth my face, Declares my Soueraignes Title, by Gods grace, Vpon my other side is, Posvi In English, I haue put (or placed) God my helper. Ananagram of the Latine Motto of Posui, plac'd into English words, Wisdome admit me Power. Devm, Whereto is added Adivtorem Mevm, The which last Poesie Annagrammatiz'd, Wisdome, admit me power, true compriz'd, Wisdome at first vpon me did bestowe Such power that for a Shillinh I should goe, When Wisdome gaue me power, I was then A seruant, not a Master vnto men. Now, Power The Annagram turn'd backward, Wisedome comes behind money. makes me Wisedome force perforce Improper, like the Cart before the Horse. For in this Age, so many friends I finde, My power's before, and Wisedome comes behinde He that for me and for my kin can rake Is wise, (although a Coxcombe) for my sake, He that wants me, shall be esteem'd an Asse, Although he be as wise as e're man was. For there's such league one in Triplicity Sworne firme betwixt the Deuill, the world, and I, That those who to the one true seruants be, Are captiue bondslaues vnto all the three. Great sway vpon the earth to vs is giuen, Por well we know we ne'r shall come in heau'n, And all that in vs take delight and mirth, Their onely heau'n is here vpon the earth. And couctous they are not, in this case, Because they couet for no better place; So much for that: now to my shape againe, You see my face is beardlesse, smooth and plaine, Because my King Edw. was crowned at nine yeeres of age, and dyed before he was sixteene.Soueraigne was a child 'tis knowne, When as he did put on the English Crowne. But had my stamp beene bearded, as with haire, Long before this it had beene worne out bare; For why with me the vnthrifts euery day, With my face downwards do at shoue-boord play Edw. shillings for the most part are vsed at shooue-boord., That had I had a beard, you may suppose Th'had worne it off, as they haue done my nose. Yet doth my bare face sometimes, now and than, Make a young beardlesse Boy, outface a man, For any Boy and I, doe both agree, To outface any man that doth want me A vpon the crosse of a Twelue-pence.crosse I beare vpon my other side, (A glorious figure of true Christian pride) And with that crosse I any man can crosse, From wrong to iniury, from harme to losse, And in me is such working powerfulnesse, That those that haue me, can both crosse and Heere I meane generally of money, and not simply of one Twelue-pence.blesse. The English and French Armes, the Lyons &amp; flowres, Shewes France a subiect once to Englands pow'rs, And when my Master did respire his breath, His sisters Mary, and Elizabeth Ordain'd new Twelue-pences with me to ioyne, But altred not my badge vpon my Coyne, Except a little, which King Philip did, Which Queene Elizabeth did soone forbid. But since the comming of my Soueraigne Iames, The badge vpon my K. Edw. Q. Mary, Q. Elizabeth, and King Iames, all their shillings of equall weight and value, and therefore my twelue-pence hath vpon his backe the Royall Armes here expressed in verse.back more worth proclaimes. And to mixe state with truth, truth with delight, Vpon the Armes I carrie, thus I write. Vpon the Kings Armes. Three Lyons Lyon of Scotland. Passant (borne by former Kings) Subdues the Harp Ireland., quarters the flowres of France The Flower de lewce of France., Fourth Lyon Rampant, equall honour brings, Though hauing power to war, doth peace aduance, Vnited in great Iames this Royall stile, King of great Britaine, France, and Irelands Ile. Thus Readers, hauing printed for your reading, My birth, my rising, my estate, and breeding: My Badge, my face, my Crosse, my Annagram, How mighty in my great command I am, Now will I tell some trauels I haue had, Some (as I remember) I'le recite, Should I name all, 'twere almost infinite. One ask'd the Cinnicke Diogenes. wise Athenian, The cause why siluer look'd so pale and wan? He, in reply was quicke, and answer'd straite, Because so many for it lay in waite. And did men thinke in what diuersity Of fashions men for me in waite doe lye, They would agree together in a tale, That I had reason to looke wan and pale. I haue of Treason, bin made Instrument To betray Kingdomes, and to circumuent, To vndermine, and to subuert the states Of Empires, and of mighty Potentates. I haue caus'd murther, cruell Homicide, Foule Fratricide, vnnaturall Paricide. For which a curse doth vnto me remaine, A Runuagate, and a Vagabond like Caine. And though that God in thundring Maiestie Forbad man to haue any Gods but he, Yet many thousands that command, forget, Not minding God, their minds on me they set On Money.. To purchase me, men haue forsworne and sworne, And from the Booke of life their names haue torne. For me the Sabbath is prophan'd with workes Of Christians labours, worse then Iewes or Turkes. For me those Parents that haue nurst and bred Their children, by them are dishonoured, For to haue me (to endlesse ioy or woe) Some children care not where their Fathers goe. I with the deu'ls sole helpe (my sole partaker) Haue bin an vniuersall Cuckold-maker: For where nor wit, or beauty could come in, In any shape I could admittance win. I make the Husband sometimes keepe the dore, The whil'st (for me) his wife doth play the whore. And many times (to moue all hell to laughter) I made a Mother Bawde vnto her Daughter. I'forc'd a Virgin cast off continence And Chastity, and put on Impudence. I made a reuerend Iudge to take a Bribe, I made a Scribe a forged Name subscribe, I caus'd a Miser sell his soule to hell, Because I here on Earth with him should dwell. There is no anchor in the text for this note.— Twelue-pence is a shrift. And eighteene yeeres he kept me day and night Lock'd in a Chest, not seeing any light. And though my lot was thus a Slaue to be, Yet was he a farre worser Slaue to me; For he had vow'd himselfe to death to pine, Rather then spend one penny pot of wine, Although he late had swallow'd downe his throat, Stinking fresh Herrings threescore for a Groat. And he did bide this slauish misery, On purpose to debarre my liberty. At last this poore, base penurious Knaue, Was borne (the way of all flesh) to his Graue: And his braue heire vpon his backe had got A mourning merry sute, long look'd I wot, He the next day let flie the ill got treasure, And I began to see some worldly pleasure; From my old Masters Chest I was assum'd To my young Masters pockets, sweet perfum'd, 'T a bawdy house, of the last new translation He bare me with him, for his recreation, There for a maydenhead he plaid a game, Where eightscore more before had done the same: There did my Master Knaue discharge the score, And went, and left me with my mistris Whore. I stai'd not in her seruice long, for shee Was not two dayes before she set me free, For hauing got a Frenchified heat, She was prescrib'd a Dyet and a sweat, She gaue me to the Surgeon, for some Lotion, For Unguents, and a gentle working Potion, For Plaisters, and for oyntments in a Box, And so I left my Mistris, with a Pox. The Surgeon me to the Physician sent, From him I to th'Apothecary went, But there I thought that Hell I had beene in, And all the Fiends had in his Boxes bin. For it appear'd to me that all his drugs Had got the names of the infernall Bugs: Zarzaparilla, Colloquintida, Auxungia Porci, Cassia Fistula, Egiptiacum, Album Camphiratum, Blacke Oxicrotium, and white Sublimatum. But soone my Master freed me from my feare, He to the Tauerne went and left me there. And whilst I in the Vintners house remain'd, Some knowledge of my Masters state I gain'd. Let no man say that drunke, my selfe I showe, For what I speake, I vnderstand and know. I'le shew some discommodities that waite (For the most part) on euery Vintners state. First, if a rowe of houses stands together, All of one bignesse form'd, no oddes in either, If one of them be to a Vintner Vintners rents dearer then any almost by halfe. let, Amongst the rest at double rent 'tis set. Next, if French Wine be twenty pound the Tonne, But a poore penny in a quart is wonne: Besides, he sometimes in the Caske doth finde, Of Lees sixe Gallons, for a Lagge behinde. And more, when in the Celler it is laid, The Carmen, and Wine-Porters must be paid. And by misfortune if the Caske be weake, Three or foure Gallons in the ground may leake, Or taking vent, it may grow dead and flat, And then the Vintner little gets by that. And if he be a fellow of free heart, He now and then must giue a pint or quart. His Candles (night and day) are burning still Within his Seller, lest his Wines should spill: And if two Kennell-rakers chance to come, To come i'th euening, they must haue a roome, And ouer one bare pint will sit and prate, And burne a Candle out (perhaps) thereat, Whilst all the Drawers must stay vp and waite Vpon these fellowes, be it ne'r so late: The whilst a Candle in the Kitchin wastes, Another to his end ith'Seller hastes, One with the Guests, another at the Barre, Thus for one pint, foure Candles burning are. By day-light, this I haue seene some to doe, Call for a pipe, a pint, and Candle to, By that time he hath done, 'tis quickly counted, To what large summe the Vintners gaines amo?ted. Besides all this, his charge is euer great, For seruants wages, cloathes, and fire, and meat, For linnen, washing, Trenchers, losse of Plate, For Glasses broken (by the course of Fate) All, or the most of this is most true on mine owne knowledge.Besides, he hath some scores, which if you looke, They make his posts look white, &amp; black his book: And if a debter seu'n long yeeres doe stay, But six pence for a quart of wine hee'll pay, When if a Merchant doe a Vintner trust For his forbearance deare he answer must. And when some Guests haue liquor in their braines, How they will swagger in their roaring straines, Out goe their swords, and by the eares they fall, And now and then one's nail'd vnto the wall. The man and's wife abus'd, his seruants beaten, No moneyes pay'd for what is drunke or eaten, His house in question brought, a man is kill'd, His and his wiues heart both with sorrow fill'd, And whereas other Trades their labours end At night, till midnight He doth still attend, Besides if Drawer be neuer so good a man, yet euery paltry fellow will call Boy, fill more Wine.At euery Groomes command officiously He waits, and takes hard words most courteously. He that amongst these harmes can purchase profit, Much good may't doe him, he is worthy of it. My Masters Vintner Trade, I thought to touch, Because I cannot thinke his gaines is much, I loue them all, my lines here manifests, And so God send them honest sober guests. From thence vnto the Wine-Marchant I went, He presently me to the market sent: For Butter, and for Egges I was exchang'd, And to the Country with my Dame I rang'd. Her Husband gaue me to a lab'ring Ditcher, He to the Ale-house went, and bang'd the Pitcher. To stay long there, I was exceeding loth, They vs'd so much deceit with nick and froth. My Master Host, vnto the Brewer gaue me, The Malt-man came on Munday, &amp; would haue me, He to the Alehouse brought me backe in haste, From thence I quickly to the Baker past, My seruice there was very short and briefe, He plac'd me with a Miller and a Thiefe, That was a merry Master for the nonce, He got his liuing cogging with two stones; I next dwelt with a Butcher, that had tricks To liue and thriue by Mutton and by pricks. Thus haue I oft beene tossed to and fro, From bad to worse, from misery to woe, From miserable Slaues, to Prodigals, To arrant Thieues, and to good Hospitals, To good and bad, to true men and to Taylers, I haue set downe all these Masters of Twelue pence, not in order as they are in degree, but as hee trauailed from man to man, good and bad, poore and rich, without any order.To Fiddlers, Pipers, Fishmongers, and Saylers, To Mercers, Grocers, Drapers, Tinkers, Peddlers, To Fruiterers, for Pipins, Plumbs, and Medlers, To Silk-men, Sadlers, Turners, Tylers, Glasiers, To Tripewiues, Mealm?, Gardners, Grasiers, Brasiers, To Plummers, Bricklay'rs, Smithes, and Carpenters, To Dyers, Goldsmiths, and to Playsterers, To Noble-men, to Water-mea, and to Ioyners, To honest men, to Knaues, to clipping Coyners, To Knights, to Beggers, Scriu'ners, Colliers, Lawiers, To Stationers, to Printers, Silk-men Sawyers, To Fooles, to Wise-men, Dunces, and to Doctors, To Harlots, Varlots, Serieants, Bayliffes, Proctors, To Papists, Protestants, and Puritans, To Traytors, Subiects, Matchiuillians, To Catchpoles, Beadles, Iaylors, Ironmongers, To Cooks (whose labours do asswage m?s hungers) To Cuckolds, Bawdes, to greasie Pimps &amp; Panders, To Cowards, valiant men and stout Commanders, To Fishers, Fowlers, Shepheards, Queristers, To Feather-makers, Girdlers, Barristers, To Players, Bearewards, Fencers, to goodfellowes, To those that make no breath, yet c? make bellows, To Pewt'rers, Shoomakers, and Buttonmakers, To Marshals men, and dirty kenell-rakers.

These Masters haue I seru'd, and thousands more Of all degrees and Trades, on seas and shore. And amongst all the places that I had, Whereas I found one good, I got ten bad; If I did serue a poore man but one day, I fiue yeere (for it) with the rich would stay. I haue bin Twelue-pence seuenty od long yeere, And to the world I'le make it plaine appeare, Heere are a strange gallymawfrey of Twelue-pences Masters, honest men &amp; Knaues like hearbs &amp; weeds in a Hotchpotch. That where I had one Master lou'd the poore, I had ten Drunkards, that did loue a Whore, For each houres seruice good men had of mee, To my great griefe I seru'd bad people three. I weare the Kings badge, yet flie from the King, And to a Misers Chest I profit bring. The words I haue are Latine, which implies, That I should waite vpon the learn'd and wise, But for one Scholler, that can vnderstand, I haue seru'd twenty Artlesse fooles command. My seruice to the Poets hath bin euill, I ranne more swift from them, then from the Deuill, I know not well the cause, but they and I Together long could ne'r keepe company. I haue a true excuse that will defend me, They Poets and money are in emulation. loue me not, which makes e'm quickly spend me. But there's no great loue lost 'twixt them and mee, We keepe asunder, and so best agree. They that doe loue me best, beyond Our English Coyne is well beloued beyond the Seas. Sea dwell, For there I am like to a soule in hell, From whence there's no returning, and so I In the Low Countries or in Germanie, If they doe get me once vpon their shore, 'Tis ten to one I ne'r see England more. I haue seru'd Cut-purses, and high-way Fellowes, And haue brought ten thousand to the Gallowes, Were he the arrantst Thiefe that euer 'twang'd, For my loue he would venture to be hang'd. Some Scriueners, &amp; some Post Knights (it appeares) Fo louing me too much, haue lost their eares, There's many a reuerend Bawde rode in a Cart, For bearing vnto me a louing heart, There's many a swee-fac'd Punk hath bin perplext, Whip'd, &amp; behind her When a Whore is whip'd, she is vex'd behind her backe. back, much grieu'd &amp; vext, Some of my Masters, would take paines to haue me, And like to Barbers, wash, clip, poll, and shaue me, In this I onely differ from a Whore, We both haue wicked followers great store: The whore they may kisse, clip and coll, and strip, Me they may safely kisse, but neuer clip. And now and then, like imitating Apes, With Brasse, Tin, Iron, they counterfeit my shapes. They lou'd me more then honesty requires, But commonly the Hangmin payes their hires. Thus though I be but of a small account, I haue had power to make my Master mount, And some againe (by their owne bad endeuour) I haue had power to sinke them downe for euer. To some I am (in comming) slowe as Lead, But quicke as Quicke-siluer, againe soone fled. Suppose that any mischiefe that could be, Had lately bin by th'onely meanes of me, As casting good men into great distresse, T'vndoe the Widdow and the Fatherlesse, A long delaide sute, longer to prolong, Or hang'd a guiltlesse man, that did no wrong: Corrupted a chaste Mayd, intic'd a Wife To folly, and to loath her Husbands life: If I had bin the meanes to worke all this, Or ten times more such actions of amisse, Yet doe I looke as white as Innocence, And neuer blush, at the most vile offence. Nay more, there's none will (for my faults refraine me,) But euery one will straitway entertaine me. If treason (through my meanes) bee thought or wrought, I neuer am vnto my triall brought: For I haue had the triall touch before, And am so knowne, I shall be tride no more. For though I be in ill, chiefe formost Actor, No man suspects me for a malefactor, And if there be one man that will reueale me, There are at least ten thousand will conceale me. Indeed I was a Pagan Siluer first found amongst Pagans and Heathen. borne at first, And since in Christendome I haue beene nurst, So they might haue me to encrease their pelfe, Many are turn'd worse Pagans then my selfe. For I no God or deity did know, To whom I should my loue and seruice show: But they forsake their God, whom they know well, And make a God of me, an Infidell. So, though I be but of a Heathen state, I am no base Apostate, Reprobate. Look on the hearbs, the flowr's, the fruits, the trees, Fowles of the ayre, the painefull lab'ring Bees, And aske their Owners why they breed and spring, His answere is, they must him money bring. Note but the toyling Plow-man, he is sowing, He's hedging, ditching, taking, reaping, mowing, Goes to bed late, and rises before day, And all to haue my company, hee'll say. For me with dagled Gownes, and dirty ham'd The Hall at Westminster, ith' Terme is cram'd, Such writing, running, sweating, interceding, Remouing Causes, Pleading, Counterpleading, Aske the cause why, the answer true will be, All men labour for money, but not with a like deuotion.Their wrangling and their strife is all for me. Looke in the Towne, how folkes throng to &amp; fro, So thicke, one cannot for another goe, And how the Shops with Wares are furnish'd out: How euery one stares, pryes, and gapes about. Demaund the reason, all will answer make, They watch, &amp; waite, cause they would money take. I know, not why my reputation's such, But still my credit hath beene wondrous much, I am more willing taken, now and then Then a seal'd Bond of any Ready money is as good as any mans bond. Aldermen, For by long proofe, the Prouerbe true doth say, That ready money euer will away. I am no worse then I haue beene of old, When thrice my worth, for me was bought &amp; sold, For I could once haue paid a quarters rent For a small Garden, and a Tenement, And that (for me) of Barly, Wheat or Rye, Three times as much as now a man might buy: The cause why now I not so much attaine, Is (that I am not lighter halfe a graine) But that through greedinesse, and hatefull pride, I still am ill imployde, and worse applide: For though the world be in a tott'ring state, A Shilling is a constant Twelue-pence.Yet am I constant alwayes at one rate, Let house, land, cloathes, food, high or lower rise, I am in value, alwayes at one sise, Raise the price vp, or let it fall downe lowe, A shilling is but Twelue pence, all men know, I am the same I was, 'tis onely men Haue lost the consciences they harbour'd then. I might (as they might vse me) be a blessing, And they make me the cause of their transgressing, Some to obtaine me into mischiefe runne, And some to spend me haue destruction wonne: Here I speake generally of money.There's many a Master, where I vs'd to dwell, That tooke delight (with me) to purchase hell. And all the vicious wayes they ranne a side, They made the Deuill and me, their onely guide: (Perhaps) their Fathers went to hell to haue me, And their mad heires, run the same way to leaue me, The whilst a haire-brain'd needy crue beset me, And gallop to the Deu'll amaine, to get me. Thus vilely, how to get, and keepe, and spend me, Three quarters of the world doe still attend me. I haue made Mariages in many a place. Where hath bin neither beauty, wit, or grace, All's one for that, I am of that high price, I can make vice seeme vertue, vertue vice. I am of that great power, and high command, In ioyning house to house, and land to land: That where one hath a dwelling to abide. One hundred knows not where their heads to hide: And as one may three hundred Tenants haue, Fiue hundred know not where to haue a graue. Far though from Earth man hath originall, And to the Earth, from whence he came doth fall, Though he be Earth, &amp; can claime nought but earth, (As the fraile portion due vnto his birth) Yet many thousands that the earth doth breed, Haue no place (certaine) where to lodge or feed: In which respect mens pleasures are behinde The Birds, and Beasts for they contentment finde With the prouision dame Nature giues, Free (wiout money) euery Creature liues, Their foode, attire, their Caues, dens, holes, &amp; rests, They haue and hold, as their owne interests. And man, that hath a reasonable soule, Whose reason countermands each beast and fowle, Within whose face, a Maiestie is seated, Beyond all Creatures that were e're created; Yet let him but want money, and 'tis plaine, He's th'onely briefe and abstract of disdaine, Despised, scorn'd, deiected, and contemn'd, And round about with miseries behem'd. Search all the worlds Records from age, to age, And view Times variable Pilgrimage: Note that though Fortune (in her tott'ring guise) Hath play'd at Foot-ball with great Monarchies, Yet shall you finde how euer States haue varied, How-euer things were carried or miscarried, That money still bare the commanding sway, To whom both right and wrong, and all obey. Should all the Witches in the whole world sit In Counsell, and imploy their damned wit, And haue the aydes of all the fiends of hell, With many mumbling Necromantick spell, And all this toyle and paines of their should be, To bring Pecunia into infamy, To cast my Lady Argent in disgrace, And make some other thing supply her place: The fruits of all their labours they should finde, Would be like throwing feathers 'gainst the winde: For in mans heart 'tis rooted with such loue, That nothing else but Death can it remoue. And many humane reasons doe approue it, That aboue all things earthly he should loue it, Do'st thou want honour, money straite will buy it. Although ten thousand needy Slaues enuie it. Would'st thou an office thy estate to reare, Money will helpe thee to't man, neuer feare: Do'st want wit how to guide and gouerne it? If thou hast money thou canst want no wit. Art thou a damned Matchiuillian, Thy money makes thee held an honest man. Hast thou a scuruy face, take this of me, If thou hast money, 'tis not seene in thee. Would'st haue a Whore, a coach, smoke, drinke, or dice? Money will bring thee all at any price. Woul'dst haue all pleasures in variety, Money will thy insatiate wants supply: Then seeing money can doe what it will, Haue not men reason to regard it still? Some things there are that money cannot win, But they are things men take small pleasure in; As Heau'n, and a good Conscience, Vertue, Grace, He that loues Money, cannot these imbrace. For he whose heart to Money, is inclin'd, Of things Cœlestiall hath but little minde. If Money were a woman, I doe see, Her case most pittie pittifull would bee, Because I thinke she would no louers haue, Except a Gowty miserable Knaue: One that all night would by her lye and Grone, Grip'd with the Collicke, or tormenting Stone, With stinking coughing, gr?ting, spitting, spauling, And nothing but Contagious Catterwalling. Besides hee'd be so Iealous day and night, He would not suffer her goe out of sight: That sure I thinke her Case farre worse would be, Then is the Turkish Galley slauery. For none but such as those whome Age hath got Old men loue money best., Are in the Loue of Money extreme hot. And when as Hearing, Sent, and Taste, and sight, Are gone, yet Feeling Money's their delight. The whilest a Young-man, full of strength and pride, Would make her goe by water, Run and Ride, Force in all things to supply his neede, For Recreation, or to Cloath and Feede, Compell her to maintaine him fine and braue. And in a word make her his Drudge or Slaue, And all his Loue to her would be so so, For hee'd but kisse her, and so let her goe. Thus if It were a Woman as I say, Her Case were lamentable euery way: For Old men within Doores would euer worr'y her, And youngmen round about the world would hurry her. That were she matchd with either yong or old, Her miseries would still be manifold. But this Commanding bright Imperious Dame, Vsde well or ill, Shee's euermore the same: Locke her, or Let her loose, she cares not which, She still hath power the whole world to bewitch. I call to minde, I heard my Twelue-pence say, That he hath oft at Christmas beene at play: At Court, at th'Innes of Court, and euery where Throughout the Kingdome, being farre and neere. At Passage, and at Mumchance Strange alteration., at In and in, Where Swearing hath bin counted for no Sinne, Where Fullam high and Low-men bore great sway, With the quicke helpe of a Bard Cater Trey. My shilling said such swaggering there would be quoth he Among the wrangling Knaues for me Such shouing, sholdring, thrusting, thronging, setting, Such striuing, crowding, iustling, and such betting, Such storming, fretting, fuming, chafing, sweating, Refuse, renounce me, damne me, swearing, cheating, So many heauy curses, plagues and poxes, Where all are losers, but the Butlers boxes: That sure in hell the Deuils are in feare, To curse and to blaspheme as they doe there. Whilst without touch of conscience, or of sence, They abuse th'Almighties great Omnipotence, And this wicked stirre that they doe make, Is me from one another how to rake. There are no anchors in the text for these notes.— And tewnty games more. False Dice. That though I were a Pagan borne, I see They make themselues much worse to pocket me. I speake not against honest mirth, friendly Gaming, nor good cheere, but against the vnlawfull vse of these Recreations, and abuse of God.These Gamesters make this time a time of mirth, In memory of their blest Sauiours birth. Whose deare remembrance, they doe annually Obserue with extreme odious gluttony, With gurmandizing beastly belly filling, With swinish drinking, and with drunken swilling, With ribald Songs, Iigges, Tales, &amp; gawdy cloathes, With bitter cursings, and most fearefull oathes, That svre my shilling saith, the My shilling is no Puritan for all this.Heathen will Not entertaine the Deuill halfe so ill; But worship Satan in more kinde behauiour, Then some professed Christians doe their Sauiour. In Saturnes raigne when money was vnfound, Then was that age with peace and plenty crown'd, Then mine was thine, Thine mine, and all our liues, All things in common were, except our wiues. But now the case is altred (as they say) Quite topsie-turuy the contrary way: For now mens wealth is priuatly kept close, The whilst their wiues are commonly let loose. For he whom loue of money doth besot, For's owne soule, or's wiues body, much cares not. It bewitch'd Achan at the siege of Ai, For which the Israelites did lose the day: It made Gehezi false in his affaires, And gain'd the Leprosie for him, and's heires, It with th'Apostle Iudas bore such sway, That it made him the Lord of life betray; And Ananias and his wretched wife, By suddaine death it made them lose their life; And Diuine stories, and prophane, recite Examples of such matters infinite, 'Tis said in Salomons Dominions, That Siluer was as plenty as the Stones: But sure the sinne of Couetise was not Amongst them either borne, or scarce begot. For all that Siluer, and a great deale more, Rak'd and Rip'd from the Europian shore, From Asia, and Sun-parched Africa, And from the wombe of vast America, From which last place the Potent King of Spaine, Eleuen millions in one yeere did gaine, And from Pottozzy Mines he daily had Three hundred thirty thousand Ryals made. To speake what mighty summes King Dauid won, And left them vnto Salomon his Son, 1 Chro. 22. A Talent of Gold is in value 600. Crownes.Of Gold one hundred thousand Talents fine, Siluer one Thousand thousand, from the Mine, There are no anchors in the text for these notes.— Ioshua 7. 2 Kings 5. Acts 5. 1 Kings 10. 27. Purchas. Besides from Ophír he had at the least, Three thousand Golden talents of the best. Iosephus Ioseph in the seuenth Booke of his Antiquities. doth of Dauids Tombe thus write, How th'hidden Treasure there was infinite, The Basons, Candlesticks, and Censors all, Lampes, Organs, Instruments most musicall, Ports, Altar, Tables, Hindges the Gates to hold, They were all made of pure Refined Gold. Besides six hundred Shields and Targets more, The King causd all with Gold be plated o're. Besides the Richnes of his Royall Throne, The like whereof And more the Captaines 5000. Talents, and 10000 pieces of Gold, and 10000. Talents of Siluer, besides Brasse and Iron.elsewhere was neuer none. When the Great Macedonian did subdue Darius, Quintus Curtius.and his haples Persian Crue, 'Tis said his Treasure did so much abound, Twenty nine thousand Talents there was found. And more he saith (if we may credit this) How that in Susa and Two Cities in Persia. Persepolis, They found, of Siluer to encrease their store One hundred seuenty thousand Talents more When Cyrus Conquer'd Crœsus Crœsus lost Three hundred millions of good Gold almost, 'Tis writ that Midas About 60. millions of Crownes.Treasure so amounted Innumerable, not be Accounted. Sardanapalus an Assyrian A most licentious Prince.King, Neere eight score millions to the fire did bring. Where fifteene daies did burne his house, &amp; pelfe, His whores, &amp; ('mongst the rest) his wretched selfe. And Plutarch saith, Marke Of Crownes, which was much of it for Souldiers pay. Anthony spent cleare Of Gold, full sixe score millions in one yeere. What should I speake of Cleopatraes Treasures, Or wealth, or Triumphs of the Roman Cæsars? Or what they were whose riches haue bin such? Or who they are that now possesse too much? But here's the question, seeing times of old Did yeeld such store of siluer and of gold, And seeing daily more and more is found, Digg'd in aboundance from the solid ground, I muse which way the Deuill all is gone, That I, and thousand thousands can haue none. I know my selfe as able to abuse it, As any man that knowes well how to vse it, But sure I neuer should my Master make it, But as my seruant take it, and forsake it. I haue described in particular What Twelue-pence is, how it hath trauell'd far: How to all ages, Sexes, Trades and Arts, It comes and goes, it tarries and departs: I could tell further how it doth command, In A shilling is a Presse-master. pressing men to serue by sea or land, How Bakers thirteene penny loaues doe giue All for a shilling, and thriue well and liue, How it a pottle of good Clarret buyes, How 'tis a quart of rich Canaries prise, How for a thousand things 'tis daily ranging, And is so round a summe, it needs no changing, How vp and downe the world he still doth firrit, And takes no more rest then an ayery spirit. Then at the last my Muse to minde doth call, The mighty power of money in generall, And how all ages still haue had good store, Musing the cause my selfe can haue no more. And A request to Money. Money hauing writ all this for thee, Shew not thy selfe ingratefull vnto me: But as I know thou canst, so preethee grant That when I want, thou wilt supply my want, Reward thy Poet, that doth set thee forth, I'le loue thee still, according to thy worth.

THE DESCRIPTION HOW THE WHOLE NAVY IS VICTVALLED WITH THIRTY TWO SORTES OF LING, BESIDES OTHER NECESSARIES. [Iniurious death, to make an Emperour mourne] Iniurious death, to make an Emperour mourne Fleabitten Otho's timelesse Exequies, Who might haue liu'd, and borne great Conquerors, And beene the father of most valiant Coltes; Lament, yee Meedes, whereon this Palfray graz'd, Ah! strew the streets of Rome with rotten hay. Let Pease, Beanes, Oates, and horse-bread must with griefe Rust Curry-combes, and Saddles rent in sunder, Breake stirrop-leathers, girths, and bridle, breake, Fall racke and manger, plankes all in twaine, For you shall ne're support his weight againe, You stable Groomes that comb'd his crisped mane, And oft were grac'd to make vp Otho's traine, Sigh, groane, and weepe, lament, and howle and cry, In litter and horse dung euerlastingly: Thinke how braue Otho did his breath respire, Who with his heeles hath oft strook sparkling fire. Heere Nero speakes. The brauest beast that euer Emperour back'd, That thump'd the field of Mars with greater grace Then Pegasus bearing Tritonia About the valleies neere the Muses Hills, In battaile swifter then the Northern wind, But in a triumph stout and full of state, Lifting his hoofes, as if he scorn'd the ground. And meant to make the ayre support his weight. As mannerly and moderate at his meate As is a Bride-groome on his wedding day, For neuer would he touch a locke of hay, Or smell vnto a heape of prouender Vn till be heard anoyse of Trumpets sound, Whereby he knew Our meate was serued in. But after meales, how he would meditate Vpon his Tutors reuerend documents, And by himselfe would practise what was taught him, Offring to run the Ring, and fetch Curuets, To trot in state as we were on his backe, And to out-doe his schole-master in Arte, The thought of these things (Otho) kils my heart. Otho speaks to the two Asses. Then these poore Animals haue cause to weepe, Most reuerend Asses, you haue lost a friend, A friend, a father haue your worships lost, Who would haue giu'n you pensions in your age, And made you Beadsmen, free from Cariages. When he lay speechlesse, on his death bed, then He pointed to the hay-loft with his heeles, As who should say, If I dye, giue it them. Then to the Wardens of his Company, (For he was made free of the Blacke-Smiths Craft) He turn'd about, bade them pull off his shooes, And take them as true tokens of his loue. And as he dying shewed his loue to them, Because his Master did delight in Playes, He wil'd that of his mane should beards be made, And of his tayle, a head-tire for a Deuill. One Asse he made his sole Executor, The other Ouer-seer of his will: Graunt, Iupiter they, may performe the same To doe andoue-see, that men may say, They were Iust Ouer-seers another day. Epitaph.

FINIS. [THE BEGGER.] THE PRAISE, ANTIQVITY, AND COMMODITIE OF BEGGERIE, BEGGERS, AND BEGGING. A Begger from an Antiquity of Beggers. Ancient house begins, Old Adams sonne, and heire vnto his sins: And as our father Adam did possesse The world, there's not a Begger that hath lesse. For whereof is the world compact and fram'd But Elements, which to our sence are nam'd, The Earth, the Ayre, the Water, and the Fire, With which all liue, without which all expire? These, euery Begger hath in plenteous store, And euery mighty Monarch hath no more. Nor can the greatest Potentate aliue, The meanest Begger of these things depriue. The Vniuersality. Earth is common, both for birth or Graues, For Kings, and Beggers, Free-men, and for Slaues: And a poore Begger as much Ayre will draw, As he that could keepe all the world in awe, The Earth, Ayre. Water, Fire Water, be it Riuers, Seas or Spring, 'Tis equall for a Begger as a King. And the Celestiall Sunn's bright fire, from Heauen 'Mongst all estates most equally is giuen, If these elements could bee bought and solde, the poore Beggers should haue small roome for birth, life, or buriall.Giu'n, not to be ingrost, or bought, nor sold, For gifts and bribes, or base corrupted gold. These things nor poore or rich, can sell nor buy, Free for all liuing creatures, till they dye. An Emperour, a great command doth beare: But yet a Begger's more secure from feare. A King may vse disports (as fits the season) But yet a Begger is more safe from Treason. A Prince (amidst his cares) may merry be, But yet a Begger is from flatt'rers free. A Duke, is a degree magnificent, But yet a Begger may haue more content. A Marquesse is a title of great fame, A Begger may offend more, with lesse blame. An Earle, an honourable house may keepe, But yet a Begger may more soundly sleepe. A Vizecount may be honour'd and renoun'd, But yet a Begger's on a surer ground. A Baron, is a Stile belou'd and Noble, But yet a Begger is more free from trouble. A Knight, is good (if his deserts be such) But yet a Begger may not owe so much. A good Esquire is worthy of respect, A Begger's in lesse care, though more neglect. A Gentleman, may good apparell weare, A Begger, from the Mercers booke is cleare. A Seruing-man that's young, in older yeeres Oft proues an aged Begger, it appeares. Thus all degrees and states, what e're they are, With Beggers happinesse cannot compare: Heau'n is the roofe that Canopies his head, The Cloudes his Curtaines, and the earth his bed. The Sunne his fire, the Starre's his candle light, The Moone his Lampe that guides him in the night. When scorching Sol makes other mortals sweat, Each tree doth shade a Begger from his heat: When nipping Winter makes the Cow to quake, A Begger will a Barne for harbour take, When Trees &amp; Steeples are o're-turn'd with winde, A begger will a hedge for shelter finde: And though his inconueniences are store, Yet still he hath a salue for eu'ry sore, He for new fashions, owes the Taylor nothing, Nor to the Draper is in debt for cloathing: A Begger, doth not begger or deceaue Others, by breaking like a bankerupt Knaue. He's free from shoulder-clapping Sergeants clawes, He's out of feare of Enuies canker'd iawes: He liues in such a safe and happy state, That he is neither hated, nor doth hate. None beares him malice, rancour, or despight, And he dares kill, those that dare him backe-bite. Credit he neither hath, or giue to none, All times and seasons, vnto him are one: He longs not for, or feare a quarter day, For Rent he neither doth receiue or pay. Let Nation against Nation warres denounce, Let Cannons thunder, and let Musket bounce: Let armies, armies, force 'gainst force oppose, He nothing feares, nor nothing hath to lose. Let Towns and Towres with batt'ry be o're-turn'd, Let women be deflowr'd and houses burn'd: Let men fight pell-mell, and lose life and lim, If earth and skies escape, all's one to him. O happy begg'ry, euery liberall Art Hath left the thanklesse world, and takes thy part: And learning, conscience, and simplicity, Plaine dealing, and true perfect honesty, Sweet Poetry, and high Astronomy, Musickes delightfull heau'nly harmony, All these (with begg'ry) most assuredly Haue made a friendly league to liue and dye. For Fortune hath decreed, and holds it fit, Not to giue one man conscience, wealth, and wit: For they are portions which to twaine belong, Wit, wisedome, wealth, and conscience, are not vsually hereditary, or in one man.And to giue all to one were double wrong, Therefore although the Goddesse want her eyes, Yet in her blinded bounty she is wise. I will not say, but wealth and wisedome are In one, ten, or in more, but 'tis most rare: And such men are to be in peace or warres, Admir'd like blacke Swans, or like blazing Starres. Two sorts of people fills the whole world full, The witty Begger, and the wealthy Gull: A Scholler, stor'd with Arts, with not one crosse, And Artlesse Nabal stor'd with Indian drosse. I haue seene learning tatter'd, bare and poore, Whilst Barbarisme domineerd with store: I haue knowne knowledge, in but meane regard, Whil'st ignorance hath rob'd it of reward: And with Coxcombs, I haue heard dispute, Whilst profound Iudgements must be dumb and mute. Apollo with aduice did wisely grant, That Poets should be poore, and liue in want: And though plaine Beggers they doe not appeare, Yet their estates doe shew their kin is neere. The barrennesse of Parnassus. Parnassus Mount is fruitlesse, bare and sterill, And all the Muses poore in their apparell: Bare legg'd, and footed, with disheuel'd haire, Nor Buskins: Shooes, or Head-tires for to weare. So farre they are from any shew of thrift, They scarce haue e'r a smock themselues to shift. The pouerty or beggery of the Muses. Homer that was the Prince of Poetry, Was a blind Begger, and in pouerty: And matchlesse Ouid, (in poore wretched case) Exil'd from Rome to Pontus in disgrace. And Mantuan Maro Virgill, he was borne in a ditch, and afterward being in Rome in seruice with Augustus Cesar, to whom he manytimes gaue learned verses, &amp; the Emperour alwayes rewarded him with bread., for some space in Rome, Was to Augustus but a Stable-Groome: His verses shew he had a learned head, Yet all his profit was but bread and bread. A Lowse A Lowse the ground of the first Hexameters. hath six feet, fr? whose creeping sprawl'd The first Hexameters, that euer crawl'd: And euer since, in mem'ry of the same, A Lowse amongst the Learned is no shame. Then since the Parnassus.Mountaines barren Muses bare, And Prince of Poets had a Beggers share: Since their blinde Soueraigne was a Begger poore, How can the Subiects but be voyd of store? What are their figures, numbers, types and tropes, But Emblems of poore shadowes, and vaine hopes? Their allegories, similies, allusions, Threed-bare doe end in beggerly conclusions: Nor can their Comedies, and Tragedies, Their Comitragy, Tragicomedies, No pastorall preterplupastorall, Their Morall studies, and Historicall, Their sharp Iambick, high Heroick Saphique, And all wherewith their painefull studies traffique, All these cannot allow a meanes compleate, To keepe them out of debt with cloathes &amp; meate. And though a Poet haue th'accomplish'd partes Of Learning, and the Axiomes of all Artes: What though he study all his braines to dust, To make his Fame immortall, and from rust, Reuoluing day by day, and night by night, And waste himselfe in giuing others light, Yet this is all the Guerdon he shall haue, That begg'ry will attend him to his graue. He (in his owne Conceite) may haue this blisse, And sing, My minde to me a Kingdome is. But 'tis a Kingdome wanting forme or matter, Or substance, like the Mooneshine in the water. For as a learned Chris. Marlo.Poet wrote before, Grosse Gold runs headlong from them to the Bore: For which this vnauoyded Vow Ile make, To loue a Begger for a Poets sake. I that ne'r dranke of Agganippes Well, That in Parnassus Suburbes scarce doe dwell, That neuer tasted the Pegasian Spring, Or Tempe, nor e're heard the Muses sing, I (that in Verse) can onely Rime and smatter Quite from the purpose, method, or the matter. Yet some for friendship, Ignorance, or pitty, Will say my lines may passe, indifferent, pritty: And for this little, Itching, Versing vaine, With me the Begger vowes he will remaine. But if I could but once true Poetry win, He would sticke close to me, is as my skin. And sure if any man beneath the Sky, Had to his Nurse a Witch, it must be I, For I remember many yeeres agoe, When I would Cry, as Children vse to doe: My Nurse to still me, or to make me cease Fr? crying, would say, Hush lambe, pray thee peace. But I (like many others froward boyes) Would yawle, &amp; bawle, and make a wawling noyse. Then she (in anger) in her armes would snatch me, And bid the Begger, or Bull-begger catch me; With take him Begger, take him, would she say, Then did the Begger such hard holdfast lay Vpon my backe, that yet I neuer could, Nor euer shall inforce him leaue his hold. The reason therefore why I am not Rich, I thinke is, 'cause my Nurse was halfe a witch. But since it is decreed that I must be A Begger, welcome begg'ry vnto me: Ile patiently embrace my destin'd Fate, And liue as well as some of higher Rate. Yet shall my begg'ry no strange Suites deuise, As Monopolies to catch Fleas and Flyes: Or the Sole making of all Butchers prickes, Or Corkes for bottles, or for euery fixe Smelt, Seacrab, Flounder, Playce, or Whiting mop, One, as a Duty vnto me to drop, Nor to marke Cheeses, Ile not beg at all, Nor for the Mouse-trap Geometricall. Nor will I impudently beg for Land, Nor (with Ambition) beg to haue Command: Or meate, or cloathes, or that which few men giue, Ile neuer beg for money whilst I liue. Yet money I esteeme a precious thing, Because it beares the picture of my King: Vnto my King I will a seruant be, And make his pictures seruants vnto me, One onely Begg'ry euer I'le imbrace, Ile beg for grace, of him that can giue grace, Who all things feedes and fils, and ouer-seeth, Who giues,, and casteth no man in the teeth. So much for that, now to my Theame againe. What vertues Begg'ry still doth entertaine. First amongst Beggers, ther's not one in twenty, But hath the Art of memory most plenty: When those that are possest with riches store, (If e'r they were in Beggers state and poore) They quite forget it, and will euer hate The memory of any Beggers state. For fortune, fauour, or benignity, May rayse a Begger vnto dignity: When like a bladder, puft with pride and pelfe, Hee'l neither know his betters, nor himselfe, But if a Begger hath bin wealthy euer, He from his minde puts that remembrance neuer. And thus if it be rightly vnderstood, A Beggers Memory is euer good. Nor he by Gluttony, or swinish surfet, Doth purchase sickenes with his bodies forfeit. On bonds, or bills, he borrowes not, or lends, He neither by extortion gets or spends. No Vsury he neither takes or gines: Oppresse he cannot, yet opprest he liues. Nor when he dyes, he leaues no wrangling heyres To lose by Law that which was his or theirs. Men that are blinde in Iudgement may see this, Which of the Rich, or Beggers hath most blisse: On which most pleasure, Fortune seemes to hurle, The Lowsie Begger, or the gowty Churle: The Ragged Begger sitting in the Stocks, Or the Embrodered Gallant with the Pocks. A Begger euery way is Adams Son, For in a Garden Adam first begun: And so a Begger euen from his birth, Doth make his Garden the whole entire Earth. The fields of Corne doth yeeld him straw &amp; bread, To Feed and Lodge, and Hat to hide his head: And in the stead of cut-throat slaughtering sh?bles, Each hedge allowes him Berryes from the brambles. The Bullesse, hedg-Peake, Hips, &amp; Hawes, and, Sloes, Attend his appetite where e'r he goes: As for his Sallets, better neuer was, Then acute Sorrell, and sweet three-leau'd Grasse, And for a Sawce he seldome is at charges, For euery Crabtree doth affoord him Vergis, His banket, sometimes is greene Beanes, and Peason, Nuts, Peares, Plumbes, Apples, as they are in season. His musicke waytes on him in euery bush, The Mauis, Bulfinch, Blackbird and the Thrush: The mounting Larke sings in the lofty Sky, And Robin-redbrest makes him melody. The Nightingale chants most melodiously, The chirping Sparrow, and the chattering Pye. My neighbour Cuckow, alwayes in one tune, Sings like a Townesman still in May and Iune. These feather'd Fidlers sing, and leape, and play, The Begger takes delight, and God doth pay. Moreouer (to accomplish his Content) Ther's nothing wants to please his sight or sent. The Earth embrodered with the various hew Of Greene, Red, Yellow, Purple, Watched, Blue: Carnation, Crimson, Damaske, spotles White, And euery colour that may please the sight. The odoriferous Mint, the Eglantine, The Woodbine, Primerose, and the Cowslip fine, The Honisuckle, and the Daffadill, The fragrant Time, delights the Begger still. He may plucke Violets in any place And Rue, but very seldome hearbe of Grace: Hearts-ease he hath and Loue and Idle both, It in his bones hath a continuall growth. His Drinke he neuer doth goe farre to looke, Each Spring's his Host, his Hostesse is each Brooke: Where he may quaffe and to't againe by fits, And neuer stands in feare to hurt his wits, For why that Ale, is Grandam Natures brewing, And very seldome sets her Guests a spewing; Vnmixt, and vnsophisticated drinke, That neuer makes men stagger, reele and winke. Besides, a Begger hath this pleasure more, He neuer payes, or neuer goes on score: But let him drinke and quaffe both night and day, Ther's neither Chalke, nor Post, or ought to pay. But after all this single-soal'd small Ale, I thinke it best to tell a merry tale: There was a Rich hard miserable Lord, That kept a knauish Foole at bed and boord, (As Great men oft affected haue such Elues, And lou'd a Foole, as they haue lou'd themselues.) But Nature to this Foole such vertue gaue, Two simples in one Compound, Foole and Knaue, This Noble Lord, ignobly did oppresse His Tenants, raising Rents to such excesse: That they their states not able to maintaine, They turn'd starke Beggers in a yeere or twaine. Yet though this Lord were too too miserable, He in his House kept a well furnish'd Table: Great store of Beggers dayly at his Gate, Which he did feed, and much Compassionate. (For 'tis within the power of mighty men, To make fiue hundred Beggers, and feed Ten.) At last, vpon a time the Lord and's Foole, Walk'd after dinner their hot bloods to coole, And seeing three or fourescore Beggers stand To seeke reliefe from his hard-clutched hand, The Nobleman thus spake his Foole vnto, Quoth he, what shall I with these Beggers doe? Since (quoth the Foole) you for my Iudgement call, I thinke it best we straightwayes hang them all. That were great pitty, then the Lord reply'd, For them and me our Sauiour equall dy'd: Th'are Christians (although Beggers) therefore yet Hanging's vncharitable, and vnfit. Tush (said the Foole) they are but beggers tho, And thou canst spare them, therefore let them goe: If thou wilt doe, as thou hast done before, Thou canst in one yeere make as many more. And he that can picke nothing from this tale, Then let him with the Bergger drinke small Ale. Thus is a Begger a strange kinde of creature, And begg'ry is an Art that liues by Nature: For he neglect all Trades, all Occupations, All functions, Mysteries, Artes, and Corporations. Hee's his owne Law, and doth euen what he list, And is a perfit right Gimnosophist. A Philosophicall Pythagoras, That without care his life away doth passe. A Begger neuer growes mad with too much study.A Lawyer must for what he gets take paines, And study night and day, and toyle his braines, With diligence to sift out Right from wrong, Writes, trauels pleads, with hands, &amp; feet, &amp; tong; And for to end Debate, doth oft debate With Rhetoricke, and Logicke Intricate: And after all his trauell and his toyle, If that part which he pleads for get the foyle, The Clyent blames the Lawyer, and the Lawes, And neuer mindes the badnes of his Cause. Tis better with a Begger that is dumbe, Whose tongue-lesse mouth doth onely vtter mum: In study, and in care, no time he spends, Dumbe Rhetoricke mooues Charity.And hath his businesse at his fingers ends. And with dumbe Rhetoricke, &amp; with Logick mute, Liues and gaines more, then many that Dispute. The weake Beggers haue a great aduantage ouer the strong.If case a Begger be old, weake or ill, It makes his gaines, and commings in more still; When Beggers that are strong, are paid with mocks, Or threatned with the Cage, the Whip, or Stocks. Hee's better borne then any Prince or Peere, In's Mothers wombe three quarters of a yeere: Beggers (for the most part) well borne.And when his birth hath made her belly slacke, Shee foure or fiue yeeres, beares him at her backe He liues as if it were grim Saturnes Raigne, Or as the golden age were come againe. Vertues that Beggers haue.Moreouer many vertues doe attend On Beggers, and on them doe they depend: Humility. Patience. Fortitude. Temperance.Humility's a Vertue, and they are In signe of Humblenesse, continuall bare: And Patience is a vertue of great worth. Which any begger much expresseth forth, I saw a Begger Rayl'd at, yet stood mute, Before a Beadle, of but base repute. For Fortitude a Begger doth excell, There's nothing can his valiant courage quell: Nor heate or cold, thirst, hunger, Famines rage, He dares out-dare Stocks, whipping-posts, or Cage. Hee's of the greatest Temperance vnder heauen, And (for the most part) feeds on what is giuen. He waytes vpon a Lady, of high price, It waytes on Charity, a worthy bountifull Mistris.Whose birth-place was cœlestiall Paradice. One of the Graces, a most heauely Dame, And Charity's her all-admired Name; Her hand's ne'r shut, her glory is in giuing, On her the Begger waytes, and gets his liuing, His State's more Antiquity. ancient then a Gentleman, It from the Elder brother (Cain) began: Of Runagates and vagabonds he was The first that wandring o're the earth did passe. But what's a Vagabond and a Runagate? True Anagramatiz'd I will relate: Rvnagate, Anagram, A Gravnte. Vagabonde, Anagram. Gave a Bond. And many well-borne Gallants, mad and fond, Haue with a Graunt so often Gaue a Bond, And wrap'd their states so in a Parchment skin, They Vagabonds and Runagates haue bin. Beggery descended from Cain, who was the first man that euer was borne, and heire apparant to the whole world.A Begger's nob'ly borne, all men will yeeld, His getting and his birth b'ing in the field: And all the world knowes 'tis no idle fable, To say and sweare the field is Honour. Courtesie. Security. Bounty. Power. Frugality. honourable. A Begger is most courteous when he begges, And hath an excellent skill in making legges, But if he could make Armes but halfe so well, For Herauldry his cunning would excell. A Begger in great safety doth remaine, He's out of danger to be rob'd or slaine: In feare and perill he is neuer put, And (for his wealth) no thiefe his throat will cut. He's farre more bountifull then is a Lord, A world of hangers on at bed and boord: Which he doth lodge, and daily cloath and feed Them and their Issue, that encrease and breed; For 'tis disparagement, and open wrong, To say a Begger's not a thousand strong: Yet haue I seene a Begger with his Many, Come at a Play-house, all in for one penny. And though of creatures Lice are almost least, Yet is a Lowse a very valiant beast. But did not strength vnto her courage want, She would kill Lyon, Beare, or Elephant. What is it that she can, but she dares do? She'le combate with a King, and stand to't too: She's not a starter like the dust-bred-Flea, She's a great traueller by land and sea, And dares take any Lady by the Rea. She neuer from a battell yet did flye, For with a Souldier she will liue and dye. And sure (I thinke) I said not much amis, To say a Lowse her selfe a Souldier is. An Hoast of Lice did to submission bring Hard-hearted Pharaoh the Egyptian King, But when these cruell creatures doe want meate, Mans flesh and blood like Canibals they eate. They are vnto the Begger, Natures gifts, A Begger is no shifting fellow.Who very seldome puts them to their shifts, True friendship.These are his Guard, which will not him forsake, Till Death, a coarse doth of his carkasse make. A Begger liues here in this vale of sorrow, And trauels here to day, and there to morrow. The next day being neither here, nor there: But almost no where, and yet euery where. He neuer labours, yet he doth expresse Beggers are trauellers.Himselfe an enemie to Idlenesse. In Court, Campe, City, Countrey, in the Ocean, A Begger is a right perpetuall motion, Hee is seldome idle, though hee neuer works.His great deuotion is in generall, He either prayes for all, or preyes on all. Deuotion.And it is vniuersally profest, From South to North, from East vnto the West. On his owne merits he will not relie; Vniuersality.By other mens good works he'le liue and die. That begg'ry is nat'rall all men know, He is a louer of good works.Our naked comming to the world doth show: Not worth a simple rotten ragge, or clout, Our silly carkasses to wrap about. Beggery is naturall &amp; generall to all the world.That its will is, and hath perpetuall bin, All goes as naked out, as they came in, We leaue our cloathes, which were our couers here, For Beggers that come after vs to weare. Beggery is perpetuall.Thus all the world in generall Beggers are, And all alike come in, and goe out bare. And whoso liues here in the best degree, The generality of beggery.Must (euery day) a daily Begger bee: And when his life hath run vnto his date, He dies a Begger or a Reprobate. (Good Reader, pray misconster not this case, I meane no profanation in this place) Then since these vertues waite on beggery, As milde Humility, and Charity, And Temp'rance, Honour, Health, Frugality, With Patience, Fortitude, and Courtesie, Security, Uniuersality, Necessity and Perpetuitie, And since heau'n sends the Subiect and the Prince All Beggers hither, and no better hence, Since begg'ry is our portion and our lot, Our Patrimony, birth-right, and what not? It is most necessary for euery one to liue and dye a Begger. Let vs pursue our function, let vs do That (which by nature) we were borne vnto. And whil'st my Muse a little doth repose, I'le Character a Begger out in prose. [Inuention many thousand wayes could go] In this poem footnotes are anchored in the text. Where anchors and footnotes do not correspond, no attempt has been made to match them. Inuention many thousand wayes could go, To shew their variations to and fro: For as vpon the soule of man attends, The world, the flesh, the deuil, (three wicked fri?ds) So likewise hath a Begger other three, With whom his humour neuer could agree. A Iustice of Peace is as the world to a Begger, a Beadle as the flesh, and a Constable as the Deuill.A Iustice to the world he doth compare, And for his flesh, a Beadle is a snare: But he, that he of all accounts most euill, He thinks a Constable to be the Deuill. And 'tis as easie for him as to drinke, To blind the world, and make a A Iustice will winke or conniue at a Beggers faults often, partly for pity, and partly to auoid trouble. Iustice winke; The Beadle (for the flesh) 'tis little paine, Which smart he can recouer soone againe. But yet the Deuils (the Constable) a spirit, From hole to hole that hunts him like a ferrit, A whipping will be soone cured.Both day and night he haunts him as a ghost, And of all furies he torments him most. All 's one for that, though some things fall out ill, A Begger seldome rides vp Holborne hill: Nor is he taken with a theeuish trap, And made dispute with Doctor Stories cap. A common theefe, for euery groat he gaines, His life doth venture, besides all his paines: For euery thing he eates, or drinkes, or weares, To lose his cares, or gaine a rope he seares. There are no anchors in the text for these notes.— A Constable is a Bugbeare to a Begger. Tyburne. But for a Begger, be it hee or shee, They are from all these choaking dangers free. And though (for sinne) when mankind first began, A curse was laid on all the race of man, That of his labours he should liue and eate, And get his bread by trauell and by sweate: But if that any from this curse be free, A Begger must he be, and none but he. For euery foole most certainely doth know, A Begger doth not dig, delue, plow, or sow: He neither harrowes, plants, lops, fells, nor rakes, Nor any way he paines, or labour takes. Let swine be meazeld, let sheepe die and rot, Let moraine kill the cattell, he cares not: He will not worke and sweat, and yet hee'l feed, And each mans labour must supply his need. Thus without paines or care, his life hee'l spend, And liues vntill he dies, and ther's an end. But I this reckning of beggry make, That it much better is to giue then take: Yet if my substance will not serue to giue, Ile (of my betters) take, with thankes, and liue. FINIS.

TAYLORS GOOSE: By Iohn Taylor. DESCRIBING THE VVILDE GOOSE, THE Tame Goose, the Taylors Goose, the VVinchester Goose, the Clack Goose, the Soleand Goose, the Huniburne Goose, Goose vpon Goose, the true nature and profit of all Geese, the honourable victories of the Gray-Goose-wing, the worthinesse of the Pen, the Description of Goosetoft, and Goose Fayre, with the valour of the Gander. VVhen restlesse Phœbus seem'd himselfe to rest His flaming Carr, descending to the West, And Hesperus obscur'd her twinkling light: Then in a sable mantle (Madame night) Tooke of the world the sole command, and keepe Charming the eyes of mortals sound a sleepe: She sent dull Morpheus forth, and Somnus both, (The Leaden Potentates of Sleepe and Sloth) Who vnto euery one good rest imparts Saue Louers, guilty mindes, and carefull hearts. The stealing houres, creep'd on with sleeping pace, When masqued Midnight shew'd her Ebon face; When Hagges, and Furies, Witches, Fairies, Elues, Ghosts, Sprites, &amp; Goblins doe disport themselues: When fond imaginarie dreames doe raigne In formelesse formes, in mans molested braine: On such a time, I sleeping in my bed, An vnaccustom'd dreame came in my head, Me thought as neere vnto a Riuers side, Within a pleasant Groue I did abide, That all the feathered birds that swims or flies, Or liues betwixt the breeding earth and skies, One at the least of euery seuerall sort, Did for their recreation there resort. There was such a variety of notes, Such warbling, &amp; such whistling fr? their throates: The Base, the Tenor, Trebble, and the Meane, All acting various Actions in one Sceane: The sober Goose (not thinking ought amisse) Amongst the rest did (harshly) keake and hisse: At which the Peacocke, and the pyde-coate Iay, Said, Take the foolish gaggling Goose away. The Goose (though angry) with a modest looke, Seem'd as she gently this affront would brooke, When all the Fowles in generall out did breake, Commanding her she should not dare to speake. Away the melancholly Goose return'd, And in a banke of Reede she sate and mourn'd, Complaining 'gainst the hatefull multitude, And iustly taxing with Ingratitude The Race of all mortality; and then Is none (quoth she) suruiuing amongst men, That will my true worth search and vnderstand, And in my quarrell take a Pen in hand, And in a stately high Heroicke stile, My Predecessours noble Acts compile, From age to age descending vnto me, That my succeeding Issue all may see The admirable deedes that I haue done, And runne that worthie course that I haue runne. O impious age, when there is no defence For Vertue, and for hated Innocence: When Flatt'rers, Fooles, and Fiddlers are rewarded, When I must liue inpittied, vnregarded! Me thought these last words ended with a keake Of such force, as if her heart would breake. At which I starting, wak'ned from my dreame, And made the Gooses wrong, my Muses theame: I' arose, put on my cloathes, sate downe, and than I tooke my Pen in hand, and thus began. From darke obliuious den I here let loose Th'imprison'd honour of the famous Goose: In her creation and originall, And after in the Law Leuiticall, And at all times before and since the Flood, A Goose hath iustly gain'd the name of good. To value her with any other Bird, Comparisons are weake and meere absurd: First, for her flesh, she is mans daily fare: She's good, she's cheape, she's plenty, and she's rare: Bake her, or rost her, vse her as you will, A good Goose.And Cooke her as she should be, she's good still: But as great summes are made with little driblets, So put the Hares head 'gainst the Gooses giblets; And men may piece a dinner vp (perhaps) Which otherwise would rise with hungry chaps: For the old Prouerbe, I must here apply, Good meate men may picke from a Gooses eye. She is good fresh, but better two dayes salted, For then she'le try if Ale or Beere be Malted; Her greace is excellent (probatum est) For such as numnesse in their ioynts molest: For the Sciatica, the Crampe, or Gowte It either cures or eases, out of doubt. Mix'd with Stauesacre, and Argentum viue, It will not leaue a man a Lowse aliue. Her lungs and liuer into pouder dride, And fasting in an Asses milke applide, Is an experienc'd cordiall for the Spleene, As oftentimes it hath approued beene. Her braines, with Salt and Pepper, if you blend And eate, they will the vnderstanding mend. Her Gall, if one be but with drinke opprest, Or meat, or fruit, and cannot well digest: But swallow't downe, and take the 'tother cup, And presently 'twill fetch the rest all vp. And thus a Goose, for med'cine and for food, I haue Anatomiz'd exceeding good. As for her qualities, whil'st she doth liue, She doth example and instruction giue: Her modesty, and affabilitie, Shewes she's descended from Gentilitie, For if they be a hundred in a troope, To a Barne doore in courtesie thei'l stoope. How neate &amp; comely they themselues will pick, That no one feather out of order stick: How grauely they from place to place will waggle, And how (like Gossips) freely they will gaggle, That sure I thinke, the fashion of her prate, Our wiues at Gossipings doe imitate. In Bookes which I neuer read. Plinie and in Gesner I doe finde, That Geese are of strange sundry sorts and kinde. In Scotland there are Geese which grow on Trees, (Which much from humane reason disagrees) Bred by the Ayre and Sunnes all-quickning fire, That ne'r was Egge, nor e'r had Dam or Sire. Then ther's a Soleand Goose, which they so call, Because the female hath but one in all. Sole is as much to say, as be alone, These Soland Geese doe breed in a little Iland in Scotland, two miles within the Sea, called the Basse, betweene twenty fiue and thirty miles beyond Barwick, where they are in such aboundance, that the Lord (or Owner) of the Iland doth yeerly receiue for these Geese two hundred pound sterling.And neuer Soleand Goose did hatch but one: Or else the name of them may well proceede From the Dams foot-sole, whence they all do breede, Which in her Claw she holds vntill it hatch, The Gander fetches food, the Goose doth watch. The Winchester Goose. Then ther's a Goose that breeds at Winchester, And of all Geese, my mind is least to her: For three or foure weekes after she is rost, She keepes her heat more hotter then a tost. She's seldome got or hatch'd with honesty, From Fornication and Adultery, From reaking Lust, foule Incest, beastly Rape, She hath her birth, her breeding, and her shape. Besides Whoremongers, Panders, Bawds &amp; Pimpes, Whores, Harlots, Curtezans, and such base Impes, Luxurious, letcherous Goates, that hunt in Flockes, To catch the Glangore, Grinkums, or the Pockes, Thus is she got with pleasure, bred with paine, And scarce ere comes where honest men remaine. This Goose is worst of all, yet is most deare, And may be had (or heard of) any where. A Pander is the Cater to the Feast, A Bawde the Kitchin Clerke, to see her drest. A Whore the Cooke, that in a pockey heate, Can dresse a dish fit for the Deuill to eate. The hot whore-hunter for the Goose doth serue, The whil'st the Surgeon, and Physician carue. The Apothecary giues attendance still, For why the sauce lyes onely in his Bill. There hath a Turkey at Newmarket bin, Which to this Goose was somewhat neere a kin: And some report, that both these Fowles haue seene Their like, that's but a payre of sheeres betweene. And one of them (to set them onely forth) Costs more the dressing then they both are worth. This Goose is no way to be tolerated, But of good men to be despisde and hated, For one of these, if it be let alone, Will eate the owner to the very bone. Moreouer, it from Nature is contrary, And from all other creatures doth vary: For of all breeding things that I could heare, The Males doe still beget, and Females beare But this hath euer a Dam masculine Engendred by a Father Feminine. Quite kim kam, wiw waw, differing from all other, The Sir's a Female, and a Male the Mother. But cease, my Muse, soyle not thy purer straine, With such contagious mud, rouze, rouze againe, From this polluted puddle, and once more, Take the same Theame in hand thou hadst before. The Taylers Goose. Bvt yet a little mirth doth make me stay: A Taylers Goose comes wadling in my way, A thing I cannot giue the Epithite Of Male or Female, or Hermaphrodite. Of Uulcans brood it is, whose Dam and Sire, Was windy bellowse, smoake, and flaming Fire. By Nature it should much delight to lye, For in a Forge it had Natiuity, Yet it with lying doth no hurt commit, Stealing is more addicted vnto it; And yet to Steele it is so neere a kin, That to be true, it doth opinion win. Tis mettle to the hard backe, I am sure, And 'tis a dish will ten mens liues endure. Be it of age a hundred winters long, It is as tender as 'twas when 'twas young. A Cooke from it can get but slender fees, It hath no Gibblets, like to other Geese. It neither breeds nor feedes, yet doth this good, It doth helpe others to get cloathes and food. And of all Geese shee's tamest, shee'l not roame, This Goose a man may alwayes haue at home. 'Tis dyet onely for an Estrich tooth, It cannot cog, yet very much doth smooth. It puts downe all the Fowles that ere man saw, Tis often rosted, yet 'tis euer raw, It is a Bird that euery slut may dresse, It knowes no warres, yet euery day doth presse. And to conclude, it is a messe of meate, Which whoso can digest it, let him eate. The prayse of the Gray Goose wing. The Winchester and Taylers Goose I see, Are both too heauy, and too hot for me: I will returne the honour to Emblaze, Of the Gray Goose that on the greene doth graze. To speake of wandring Wild-geese in this place, Were (like a Goose) to run the Wild-goose chase: The Egyptians did obserue their wonted guise, How in the Skie they flew triangle-wise, Which with one Corner forward, is their drift, Thus figured to cut the Ayre more swift. For me the wilde-Goose is too high a game, My minde is onely to the Goose that's tame, I in her Fleshes prayse haue wrote before, But yet her Feathers doe deserue much more. They are of farre more est mate and price Then th'Estrich, or the bird of Paradise, The Rauen, the Crow, the Daw in mourning dight, The prating Pye attyr'd in blacke and white, The Buzzard, Redshanke, Kite, Owle, Gull, &amp; Rook, The fabled Phœnix that breedes where (goe looke,) The Pheasant, Partridge, Turtle, Plouer, Pidgeon, The Woodcock, Woodquist, Woodpecker, &amp; Widge? The Iay, the Snipe, the Teale, the Cock, the Hen, The Chogh, the Larke, the Lapwing, &amp; the Wren, The Falkon, the Gerfalkon, Hobby, Marlin, The Sparrowhauke, the Goshauke, Tassell, Starlin, The Haggard, Keistrell, Lanneret, Cormorant, The Caperkelly, and the Termagant, The Bunting, Heathcocke, Crane, and Pellican, The Turkey, Mallard, Ducke, the Storke, the Swan, The Pewet, Parrot, and the Popinjay, The Eagle, and the Cassawaraway, The Sheldrake, Bittour, Blackbird, Nightingale, The Cuckow that is alwayes in one tale, The Sparrow of the hedge, or of the house, The Ringdoue, Redbrest, and the Tittimouse, The Bulfinch, Goldfinch, Ringtaile, Wagtaile, and The Hearne that liues by water and by land: The Swallow, Martin, Lennet, and the Thrush, The Mauis that sings sweetly in the bush; The Morecoote, the Kingfisher, and the Quaile; The Peacock, with his proud vaine-glorious taile. These sorts of Birds that I haue nam'd before, If they were thrice redoubled three times more, And let men value them but as they are, They cannot with the Goose (for worth) compare. Many of these doe feed on Carrion still, And still are Carrion, euer being ill, Neither in flesh or feathers they affoord To doe man seruice at his bed or boord. And some of them yeeld Plumes, and ornaments For Ladies, and for Knightly Tournaments: But let these toyes be weigh'd but iust and right, And thei'le be found as vaine as they are light. Others there are, as Parrots, Stares, Pyes, Dawes, Are mightily accounted of, because They can speak perfect none-sence, prate &amp; chatter, Feeding the eare: these fowles makes fooles the fatter. Then there are others great, and small in size, But great all for the greatnesse of their price, Most pleasantly their flesh men doe deuoure, The sawce lyes in the reckoning, sharpe and sowre. Some are to sing continually in Cages, And get but bread and water for their wages. And others, with great paines men doe procure With cost of Manning, Diet, Hood, Bels, Lure; The pleasure's little, and the gaine is small, A Goose for profit doth surpasse them all. When with her flesh mans stomack she hath fed, She giues him ease and comfort in his bed: She yeelds no whim-whams wauering on his crest, But she relieues him with repose and rest. And though the world be hard, she layes him soft, She beares the burthen, and he lyes aloft: Let him be drunke, or weary, sicke or lame, She's semper idem, alwayes one the same. Thus to supply our wants, and serue our needes, Good meate and lodging from a Goose procedes. Besides she loues not farre abroad to gad, But at all times she's easie to be had; As if (to satisfie mans hungry gut) She wayted still that he her throat should cut. Men neede not be at charge for Hawkes and Dogs, And ride, and run o're hedge, ditch, mires, &amp; bogs: She's quickly caught, and drest well, eates as pleasant As (far fetch'd deere bought) Partridge or a Pheas?t. Throughout the world the Trumpe of Fame loud rings, T'emblaze the glory of the Gooses wings: The Romane Eagle ne'r had spred so farre, But that the gray Goose was the Conquerer. Sosostris King of Egypt with her feather, Rain'd stormes and showres of Arrowes, like foule weather, And ouercame the Iewes, th'Assirians, Th'Arabians, Scithians, Germanes, Thracians. The Huns, the Gothes, the Vandals, and the Gals, With Arrows made great Rome their seu'rall thrals: The Philistines were mighty Bow-men all, With which they got the conquest of King Saull. Cyrus with thousands of his Persians With Shafts were slaine by the Messagetans, Turkes, Tartars, Troyans, and the Parthians, Danes, Saxons, Sweuians, and Polonians; Yea all the Nations the whole world around, The gray-Goose-wing hath honour'd and renound. But why should I roame farre and wide aloofe, When our own Kingdome yeelds sufficient proofe? But search the Chronicles, it is most plaine, That the Goose-wing braue conquests did obtaine. Remember valiant Edwards name (the third) How with the wing of this deseruing Bird, When to small purpose seru'd his Shield or Lance: At Cressie he ore-top'd the pow'r of France. And after that, remember but agen That Thunder-bolt of warre, that Mars of men, The black Prince Edward, his victorious sonne, How he at Poictiers a braue battaile wonne, Where the French King and many Peeres wer tane, Their Nobles, and their Gentles most part slaine, And thirty thousand of their Commons more, Lay in the field all weltring in their gore. Henry the fift (that memorable King) All France did vnto his subiection bring, When forty thousand of the French men lay At Agincourt, slaine in that bloody fray. And though true valour did that conquest win, But for the Gooses wing it had not bin. In these things, and much more then I can say, The Gooses feather bore the prize away. If I should write all in particular, What this rare feather hath atchieu'd in war, Into a sea of matter I should runne, And so begin a worke will ne'r be done. And thus from time to time it hath appear'd, How the gray Goose hath brauely domineer'd: With swiftly cutting through the empty skie, Triumphantly transporting victorie From land to land, offending and defending The Conquest on the Arrowes still depending. Our English Yeomen, in the dayes of old, Their names and fames haue worthily extold Witnesse that Leash, that stout admired three, Braue Adam Bell, Clim Clough, Will Clowdeslee. I could capitulate, and write vpon Our English Robin Hood, and little Iohn, How with this feather they haue wonne renowne, That euermore their memories shall crowne. And e'r the Deuill these damned Gunnes deuis'd, Or hellish powder here was exercis'd, With the Goose-wing we did more honour get, More nobly gain'd, then Gunnes could euer yet. And how hath Vice our worthy Land infected, Since Archery hath beene too much neglected? The time that men in shooting spent before, Is now (perhaps) peruerted to a Whore, Or bowling, swearing, drinke, or damned Dice, Is now most Gentleman-like exercise. But for these few that in those dayes remaine, Who are addicted to this shooting veine, Let men but note their worthy disposition, And we shall see they are of best condition, Free honest spirits, such as men may trust, In all their actions, constant, true, and iust. It is a thing I haue obserued long, An Archers mind is cleare from doing wrong, It is a note worthy respect, and marke, An Archer is no base defamed Sharke, Not giuen to pride, to couetousnesse, or To swearing, which all good men doe abhorre, Nor doth he exercise, or take delight, To cheate, to cogge, to lye, and to backe-bite, But with most louing friendly conuersation, He practiseth this manly recreation. There was a Statute in th'eight Henries raigne, Which Statute yet doth in full force remaine, Some thing in praise of the exercise of shooting. For the most part this is generall. K. Henry the 8. did with the consent of the 3. estates in the Parliament, enact a Statute, for shooting: which Statute is still of force, though not in vse. And as it stands in force, so doth my Muse Wish that it were obseru'd, and kept in vse. Within these few yeeres (I to mind doe call) The Yeomen of the Guard were Archers all, A hundred at a time I oft haue seene, With Bowes &amp; Arrowes ride before the Queene Elizabeth. Queene, Their Bowes in hand, their Quiuers on their shoulders, Was a most stately shew to the beholders: And herein, if men rightly doe obserue, The Arrowes did for two good vses serue: First for a shewe of great magnificence, And trusty weapons for to guard their Prince. Prince Charles (our hope of Britaines happinesse) Doth his affection oftentimes expresse: With many Noble men of worthy race, Doe with their best performance, shooting grace: And long may these The Highland-men or Red-shanks in Scotland, are exceeding good Archers. superiour Worthies liue, Example to th'inferiour sort to giue, That though this exercise be much declin'd, May some supporters and defenders find. King Sauls braue sonne (true-hearted Ionathan) 2 Sam. 1. 18. Dauids true friend, a Prince, a valiant man, Did in this noble quality excell, As the true story of his life doth tell. King Dauid made a Law, and did command, That shooting should be taught within this land. Thus from true Histories we plainely see, That shooting is of great antiquity: And that the glory of the Gooses wings Hath beene aduanc'd by Princes, Lords, and Kings, And that yet Princes, Peeres, and Potentates, And best of all conditions, and estates, Doe giue to Archery the praise and prise Of the best, manly, honest exercise. The praise of the Gooses Quill. And thus for shooters hauing shew'd my skill, I'le now say somewhat for the Gooses Quill. Great Mars his Traine of Military men I leaue, and turne the Shaft into a Pen: The Gooses feather acteth sundry parts, And is an Instrument both of Armes and Arts. Many diuine and heauenly mysteries, And many memorable Histories Had with blind Ignorance beene ouer-growne, And (were't not for the Pen) had ne'r bin knowne. The Muses might in Parnass hill haue staid, Their fames had ne'r bin through the world displaid But that the Gooses Quill with full consent, Was found to be the fittest Instrument To be their Nuntius, and to disperse Their glory through the spacious Vniuerse. Grammar (that of all Science is the ground) Without it in forgetfulnesse were drownd, And Rethorick (the sweet rule of eloquence) Through the Goose Quill distils it's Quintessence: Logick with definitions (I am sure) Were nothing, or else very much obscure: Astronomie would lye, or lye forgot And scarce remembred, or regarded not; Arithmetick would erre exceedingly, Forgetting to deuide and multiply: Geometry would lose the Altitude, The crassie Longitude and Latitude: And Musick in poore case would be o're-throwne, But that the Goose Quill pricks the Lessons downe. Thus all the liberall Sciences are still In generall beholding to the Quill. Embassages to farre remoted Princes, Bonds, Obligations, Bills, and Euidences, Letters twixt foe and foe, or friend and friend, To gratulate, instruct, or reprehend, Assurances, where faith and troth is scant, To make the faithlesse to keepe couenant; The Potent weapon of the reuerend Law, That can giue life or death, saue, hang, or draw, That with a Royall, or a noble dash, Can from the Kings Exchequer fetch the Cash. To most shop-keepers it a reckoning makes, What's got or lost, what he layes out, or takes: Without the Goose a Scriuener were a foole, Her Quill is all his onely working toole: And sure a Goose is of a wondrous nature, Contrary to each other liuing creature, Things that in water, earth, or ayre haue growth, And feede and liue, bite onely with the mouth: But the Goose with sophisticated skill, Doth bite most dangerously with her quill, Yet is she free from prodigality, And most of all bites partiality: She oft with biting makes a Knight a detter, A shrewd biting beast.And rankle to a Begger, little better. She oft hath bit a Gallant from his land With quick conueyance, and by slight of hand: Sometimes his biting is as durable, As is a Gangren most incureable, And many that into her fangs doe fall, Doe take the Counters for their Hospitall; A Forger, or a Villaine that forsweares, Or a False-witnesse, she bites off their eares: On me her pow'r she many times hath showne, And made me pay more debts then were mine own. Thus doth her Quill bite more then doe her chaps, To teach fooles to beware of after-claps. They say in Latine that a Gooses name Is Anser, which made in Anagram, Is Snare, in English, which doth plaine declare, Hereupon began the Prouerbes, of good Goose bite not.That she to fooles and knaues will be a snare. Indeede she oft hath beene a snare to mee, My selfe was in the fault, alas not shee. The memorable honour of the Goose sauing the Capitoll at Rome. Bvt now to shew her neuer-dying name, And how at Rome she wan deseruing fame: When barbarous Brennus, cruell King of Galls, Had wasted Italy, and raz'd Romes walls: When deuastation did depopulate, With sword and furious fire the Romane state. When many a throat was tyrannously cut, And all the Citie to the sacke was put: When many of the Citizens did flye Into the Capitoll to liue and dye, Whereas the Image of great Iupiter, (The rip rap, thwick thwack thumping thunderer) Was of refined gold, adorn'd, ador'd, Where helples fooles, poore helples helpe implor'd. The Capitoll a goodly building was, And did (for strength) by Art and Nature passe, So that the people that were there within, Thought it impregnable, that none could win: But slender watch vpon the walls they kept, And (thinking all secure) secure they slept, They thought Ioues Statue, and his Temple there, Was a sure guard, that foes they need not feare: But Ioue these dangers did not vnderstand, Or else he had some other worke in hand: Perhaps poore Io like a Cow in shape, He like a Bull then wrong'd with beastly rape, Or like a Swan for Leada, he thought fit, In that fowles forme, that foule fault to commit: Perchance that time faire Danae to intrap, He rain'd bewitching gold into her lap; He then (perhaps) did to Alcmena goe, And made a Cuckold of Amphitrio, Or else to Semele that time he came, And burnt his burning loue with lightnings flame, Perhaps with Hele he the Ram did play, Or with Europa toy'd the time away, Mnemosine he could not let alone, Or he to Hebe at that time was gone, It may be to Antiopa he went, Or to Astery, for his more content: Or it may be he lay within his bed, And play'd and fool'd with wanton Ganimede: Iupiter could not or would not helpe to defend the Capitoll, or else like many braue whoremasters, he had more mind of his leachery then his honour: so that had it not beene for the Goose, his golden Image had beene taken prisoner by the enemy.But whither Iupiter that time was got, He to defend the Capitoll was not, Vnlesse he were transformed wondrous strange, And to a Gooses shape his Godhead change: For all the Guard were sleeping at that time, When as the armed Galls the walls did clime. Then when the Watch did to destruction sleepe, The carefull Goose true sentinell did keepe, She spide the foe, and keak'd out an Alarme, At which the Sleepers wak'd, &amp; cri'd, Arme, Arme: Then they their Enemies in fury slew, Which down the battlements in heaps they threw. And thus a Goose the honour did obtaine, To saue the Romanes, which had else beene slaine: And to preserue the famous Capitall, And set Rome free from the insulting Gall. The Romane Generall that time, as then Was manly Manlius, a stout man of men, The Senate gratefully did raise anon, An Altar with a golden Goose thereon, And for the Gooses seruice had beene such, They allowd almes-Oates from the common Hutch, For old and sicke decayed Geese to feed, In memory of that braue Gooses deed. Why should the Eagle be the Bird of Ioue, When as the Goose deserueth so much loue? 'Tis plaine and euident the Goose was cause, That all Rome scap't from speedy Martiall lawes, Yet did the Romans (like ingratefull Nags) Aduance an Eagles portrait in their Flags, When as Cornelius Agrippa sayes, Cornelius Agrippa, in his vanity of Sciences. page 137. Cap. 81. The Goose deseru'd it more by many wayes. Now hauing done the Capitoll Goose right, Ile trye some other wayes to breed delight. Goostoft in Lincolnshire. In Lincolnshire an ancient Towne doth stand, Call'd Goostoft, that hath neither fallow'd Land, Or Woods, or any fertile pasture ground, But is with watry Fens incompast round. The people there haue neither Horse or Cowe, Nor Sheepe, nor Oxe, or Asse, nor Pig, or Sowe: Nor Creame, Curds, Whig, Whay, Buttermilke or Cheese, Nor any other liuing thing but Geese. The Parson of the Parish takes great paines, And tyth Geese onely, are his labours gaines: If any charges there must be defray'd, Or Impositions on the Towne is layd, As Subsidies, or fifteenes for the King, Or to mend Bridges, Churches, any thing. Then those that haue of Geese the greatest store, Must to these Taxes pay so much the more. Nor can a man be raisde to Dignity, But as his Geese encrease and multiply. And as mens Geese doe multiply and breed, From Office vnto office they proceed. A man that hath but with twelue Geese began, In time hath come to be a Tythingman: And with great credit past that Office thorough (His Geese increasing) he hath bin Headborough. Then (as his Flocke in number are accounted) Vnto a Constable, he hath bin mounted. And so from place to place he doth aspire, And as his Geese grow more hee's raised higher. Tis onely Geese there that doe men prefer, And 'tis a rule, no Goose, no Officer. At Hunnibourne, a Towne in Warwickeshire, What Gogmagog Gargantua Geese are there, For take a Goose that from that place hath bin, That's leane, and nought but feathers, bones &amp; skin, And bring her thither, and with little cost Shee'l be as fat as any Bawde, almost. For take foure Geese, and with a like expence, Feed one there, and the others two miles thence, And she that feedes at Hunnibourne shall bee More worth in weight &amp; price, then th'other three. She shall with flesh vnable be to goe, I cannot yeeld the Reason, but 'tis so A Womans Reason.. Goose Faire at Stratford Bow, the Thursday after Whitsontide. At Bowe the Thursday after Pentecost, There is a Faire of Greene Geese, ready rost, The Description of Greene-goose Faire.Where as a Goose is very dogcheape there, The Sawce is onely somewhat sharpe and deare, There (e'r they scarce haue feathers on their backe) By hundreds and by heapes they goe to wracke, There is such Baking, rosting, broyling, boyling, Such swearing, drabbing, dancing, dicing, toyling, Such shifting, sharking, cheating, smoaking, stinking, Such Gormondizing, cramming, guzling, drinking: As if the world did runne on wheeles away, Or all the Deuils in hell kept Holiday. And as Hearbs, Flowres and Weeds together grow, So people are that day at Stratford Bow, There sits a Cheater with a simple Gull, And there an honest woman, there a Trull, Yonder a Fidler dawb'd with greace and Ale, And there an Asse telling an idle tale. There's one a Rosting, yonders one a Stewing, And yon's one drinkes vntill he fall a spewing: There's a kinde Cuckold with his Wife doth wander, To exercise the office of a Pander, His Pimpship with his Punke despight the horne, Eate Gosling giblets in a fort of Corne. There is ran tan Tom Tinker and his Tib, And there's a Iugler with his fingers glib. There throngs a Cutpurse, with his working toole, And there's a gallant Coxcombe, there's a Foole. There's foure or fiue together by the eares, And tumble in the Dirt like Dogs and Beares. One staggering there hath got the drunken yox, And there one swaggering's fast within the Stocks. Thus with these Galleymaufry humours still, These Linsey-wolsey postures Good and Ill, These mingle mangle, motly toyes they spend The time, till night doth make them homeward wend. Then they returne as wise as Geese away, For whom so many Geese were slaine that day. They brought both wit &amp; money with th? thither, But with the Geese 'tis all deuour'd together. And if they were but taught as well as fed, More Coyne were sau'd, and many a wiser head. Thus (as my Muse is able) I haue told How that a Gooses vse is manifold. How many seuerall sortes of Geese there are, Some wilde, some tame, some too neer some too far. How from her flesh and entrailes, it is plaine, Foode, Physicke, Lodging, Arts, Armes, and good Society, all from a Goose.Good food and Physicke daily we obtaine: How freely she doth play the true Vpholster, And fill with Feathers, pillowes, bed and bolster. And how in many an honorable War, The gray Goose wing hath bin the vanquisher. The necessarie vses of her Quill, How to the good 'tis good, Ill to the ill. And Shooting here (according to my loue) To bee a noble Exercise I proue. And how the Goose Romes Capitoll did saue, (As sayes the Story) I described haue. And now let men examine well and try, If any Bird in water, earth, or sky, Or all in generall together are, With the good Goose (for worth) to make C?pare. Many absurdly, idle, foolish, base, Will call a man a Goose in foule disgrace: When if men rightly vnderstood the same, A man is honour'd with a Gooses name. For though the Eagle be of Birds the King, Yet 'tis a rauenous, greedy hurtfull thing. And he that with that tytle me should call, I had as leiue he call'd me Theefe withall. Shee while she liues doth yeeld reliefe to many, And aliue or dead, beholding not to any. She hath maintain'd ten thousand men, With food, &amp; Physicke, Lodging, Shafts and Pen, And lastly (not to charge them any wayes) Her owne Quill here, writes her own worthy praise. Because a Goose is common, and not deere, She amongst fooles is small esteemed heere. So Blackberryes, that grow on euery bryer, Because th'are plenty, few men doe desire: Spanish Potatoes are accounted dainty, And English Persneps are course meate, though plenty. But if these Berryes or those Rootes were scant, They would be thought as rare, through little want, That we should eate them, and a price allow, As much as Strawberryes, and Potatoes now. Why Bread is common, hauing still our fill We thinke not on, because we haue it still: But if we want Bread, then we doe remember, We want the groundworke of our belly timber. The Light is common, which few thinke vpon, Till Night doth put her blindfold mufler on, And all attyr'd in mourning blacke as pitch, Then men misse light, and tumble in the Ditch. So should we want a Gooses Flesh and Feather, The quantity of but fiue yeeres together: We then should all confesse with one consent, How that a Goose were superexcellent. Many good blessings we too much forget, 'Cause they are neere and cheape, not farre to fet. Me thinkes I heare some Cuckow, or some Iay, Some Daw, some Pye, some Gull, or Buzzard say, That I haue giuen the Goose her worthy stile, But haue forgot the Gander all this while. Ile giue them Answer (though they merit none) I doe include both sexes vnder one, Tis knowne to euery perfit vnderstander, A Goose is much superiour to a Gander. For though a man, a Mare or Gelding stride, We briefly say, he doth on Horsebacke ride: And though a Gelding be the beast that bare, We call't a Horse, that's neither Horse or Mare. So Ganders vnder name of Geese doe goe, The Gooses worthinesse deserues it so. Once I remember, Riding on my way In Barkshire, neere vnto a Towne call'd Bray, I on my Iourney as I past along, Rode by a Goose, a Gander and their young: (I neither minding them nor yet their Crue) The Gander in my face with fury flew, Who in his fierce encounter was more hot, Then if he had bin Spanish Don Quixot. But sure himselfe so brauely he did beare, Because his Loue and Lady Goose was there: And 'twas a spurre his Chiualry vnto, To haue his sweet heart see what he did doe. My Horse he started, to the ground I went, Dismounted in that (Ganderous) tournament. I should say Dangerous, but sure I am That Ganderovs is a Dangerovs Anagram. The Gander was mine enemy, what tho, Ile honour worthy Valour in my foe. He Tilted brauely, and in liew of it, The Gooses Quill, the Ganders praise hath writ; Thus for the Goose I hauing done my best, My toyled Muse retires vnto her rest: Ile shut my Inckhorne, and put vp my Pen, So take my Goose amongst you, Gentlemen. FINIS. IACKE A LENT HIS BEGINNING AND ENTERTAINMENT: with the mad prankes of his Gentleman-Vsher Shroue-Tuesday that goes before him, and his Footman Hunger attending. TO THE FISHMONGERS, AND BVTCHERS, GREETING. [Of Iacke an Apes I list not to endite] Of Iacke an Apes I list not to endite, Nor of Iack Daw my Gooses quill shall write: Of Iacke of Newbery I will not repeate, Nor Iacke of both sides, nor of Skip-Iacke neate. To praise the Turnspit Iacke my Muse is mum, Nor of the entertainment of Iacke Drum Ile not rehearse: nor of Iacke Dogge, Iacke Date, Iacke foole, or Iacke a Dandy, I relate: Nor of Blacke Iacks at gentle Buttry bars, Whose liquor oftentimes breeds houshold wars: Nor Iacke of Douer that Grand Iury Iacke, Nor Iacke Sawce (the worst knaue am?gst the pack.) But of the Iacke of Iackes, Great Iacke a Lent, To write his worthy acts is my intent; How hee's attended with a messe of Iackes, Whose fame my Artlesse weake inuention cracks, Iacke Herring and Iacke Sprat, Iacke Strawe, Iacke Cade, These are the Iacks with which my pen must trade. The Cut-throats Butchers, wanting throats to cut, At Lents approach their bloody Shambles shut: For forty dayes their tyranny doth cease, And men and beasts take truce and liue in peace: The Cow, the Sow, the Ewe may safely feed. And lough, grunt, bleate, and fructifie and breed, Cocks, Hens, &amp; Capons, Turkey, Goose, &amp; Widgeon, Hares, Conyes, Pheasant, Partridge, Plouer, Pidgeon, All these are from the breake-neck Poulters pawes Secur'd by Lent, and guarded by the lawes, The goaring Spits are hang'd for fleshly sticking, And then Cockes fingers are not worth the licking. The Whiting, Rotchet, Gournet, and the Mop, The Scate and Thorneback, in the net doth drop: The pide-coat Mackrell, Pilchard, Sprat, and Soale, To serue great Iack-a Lent amaine doe trole. The Breame, the Lamprey, Barbell, But, and Pike, Secure might keepe the Riuer, Pond, and Dike: Carps, Tench, Perch, Smelts, would neuer come to land, But for Nets, Angles, and the Fishers hand: And bawling queanes that vse to sell and buy, Would cry, because they want where with to cry. Then pell-mell murther, in a purple hue, In reeking blood his slaughtering pawes imbrew: The Butchers Axe (like great Alcides Bat) Dings deadly downe, ten thousand thousand flat: Each Butcher (by himselfe) makes Marshall Lawes, Cuts throats, &amp; kills, and quarters, hangs, &amp; drawes. Then all the zealous Puritans will feast, In detestation of the Romish beast. CERTAINE BLANKE VERSES VVRITTEN of purpose to no purpose, yet so plainely contriu'd, that a Childe of two yeeres old may vnderstand them as well as a good Scholler of fifty. Great Iacke-a-Lent, clad in a Robe of Ayre, Threw mountaines higher then Alcides beard: Whilst Pancradge Church, arm'd with a Samphier blade, Began to reason of the businesse thus: You squandring Troglodites of Amsterdam, How long shall Cerberus Tapster be? What though stout Aiax lay with Proserpine, Shall men leaue eating powdred Beefe for that? I see no cause but men may picke their teeth, Though Brutus with a Sword did kill himselfe. Is Shooters-hill turn'd to an Oyster pie, Or may a May-pole be a butterd Plaice? Then let Saint Katherins saile to Bride-well Court, And Chitterlings be worne for statute lace, For if a Humble-bee should kill a Whale With the butt-end of the Antarticke Pole, 'Tis nothing to the marke at which we ayme: For in the Commentaries of Tower Ditch, A fat stew'd Bawd hath bin a dish of state. More might be said, but then more must be spoke, The weights fell downe because the Iacke rope broke. And he that of these lines doth make a doubt, Let him sit downe and picke the meaning out. FINIS. THE PENNYLES PILGRIMAGE, OR THE MONEY-LESSE PERAMBVLATION, OF JOHN TAYLOR, ALIAS, THE KINGS MAIESTIES WATER-POET. HOVV HE TRAVAILED ON FOOT, FROM LONDON TO EDENBOROVGH IN Scotland, not carrying any Money to or fro, neither Begging, Borrowing, or Asking Meate, Drinke or Lodging. TO ALL MY LOVING ADVENTVRERS, BY VVHAT NAME OR TITLE SOEVER, MY GENERALL SALVTATION. That I should write of Cities situations, Or that of Countries I should make relations: Of brooks, crooks, nooks; of riuers, boorns and rills, Of mountaines, fountaines, Castles, Towres and hills. Of Shieres, and Pieres, and memorable things, Of liues and deaths of great commanding Kings, I touch not those, they not belong to mee: But if such things as these you long to see, Lay downe my Booke, and but vouchsafe to reede The learned Camden, or laborious Speede. And so God speede you and me, whilst I rest yours in all thankefulnesse: Io: Taylor [List Lordings, list (if you haue lust to list)] List Lordings, list (if you haue lust to list) I write not here a tale of had I wist: But you shall heare of trauels, and relations, Descriptions of strange (yet English) fashions. And he that not beleeues what here is writ, Let him (as I haue done) make proofe of it. The yeere of grace, accounted (as I weene) One thousand, twice three hundred and eighteene, And to relate all things in order duly, 'Twas Tuesday last, the foureteenth day of Iuly, Saint Reuels day, the Almanacke will tell ye The signe in Virgo was, or neere the belly: The Moone full three dayes old, the wind full South; At these times I began this tricke of youth. I speake not of the Tide, for vnderstand, My legges I made my Oares, and rowd by land, Though in the morning I began to goe, Good fellowes trooping, flock'd me so, That make what haste I could, the Sunne was set, E're from the gates of London I could get. At last I tooke my latest leaue, thus late At the Bell Inne, that's extra Aldersgate. There stood a horse that my prouant should carrie, From that place to the end of my fegarie, My Horse no Horse, or Mare, but gelded Nagge, That with good vnderstanding bore my bagge: And of good cariage he himselfe did show, These things are ex'lent in a beaste you know. There in my Knapsack, (to pay hungers fees) I had good Bacon, Bisket, Neates-tongue, Cheese, With Roses, Barberies, of each Conserues, And Mitridate, that vigrous health preserues: And I entreate you take these words for no-lyes, I had good Aqua vita, Rosa so-lies: With sweet Ambrosia, (the gods owne drinke) Most ex'lent geere for mortals, as I thinke. Besides, I had both vineger and oyle, That could a daring sawcie stomack foyle. This foresaid Tuesday night 'twixt eight and nine, Well rigg'd &amp; ballac'd, both with Beere and Wine, I stumbling forward, thus my iaunt begun, And went that night as farre as Islington. There did I finde (I dare affirme it bold) A Maydenhead of twenty fiue yeeres old, But surely it was painted, like a whore, And for a signe, or wonder, hang'd at' dore, Which shewes a Maidenhead, that's kept so long, May be hang'd vp, and yet sustaine no wrong. There did my louing friendly Host begin To entertaine me freely to his Inne: And there my friends, and good associates, Each one to mirth himselfe accommodates. At Wel-head both for welcome, and for cheere, Hauing a good New tonne, of good stale Beere: There did we Trundle downe health, after health, (Which oftentimes impaires both health &amp; wealth.) Till euery one had fill'd his mortall Trunke. And onely Nobody was three parts drunke. The morrow next, Wednesday Saint Swithins day, From ancient Islington I tooke my way. At Hollywell I was inforc'd carrowse, Ale high, and mightie, at the Blind-mans house. But ther's a helpe to make amends for all, That though the Ale be great, the Pots be small. At High-gate hill to a strange house I went, And saw the people were to eating bent, I neither borrow'd, Crau'd, Ask'd, Begg'd or Bought, But most laborious with my teeth I wrought. I did not this, 'cause meate or drinke was scant, But I did practise thus before my want; Like to a Tilter that would winne the prize, Before the day hee'le often exercise. So I began to put in vre, at first These principles 'gainst hunger, 'gainst thirst. Close to the Gate, there dwelt a worthy man, That well could take his whiffe, &amp; quaffe his Can, Right Robin Good-fellow, but humours euill, Doe call him Robin Pluto, or the Deuill. But finding him a Deuill, freely harted, With friendly farewels I tooke leaue and parted. And as alongst I did my Iourney take, I dranke at Breemes well, for pure fashions sake. Two miles I trauelled then without a bayte, The Sarazens head at Whetstone entring straight, I found an Host, might lead an Host of men, Exceeding Fat, yet named Lean, and Fen. And though we make small reckoning of him here, Hee's knowne to be a very Great man there. There I tooke leaue of all my Company, Bade all farewell, yet spake to No-body. Good Reader thinke not strange, what I compile, For No-body was with me all this while. And No-body did drinke, and, winke, and scinke, And on occasion freely spent his Chinke. If any one desire to know the man, Walke, stumble, Trundle, but in Barbican. Ther's as good Beere and Ale as euer twang'd, And in that street kind No-body is hang'd. But leauing him vnto his matchlesse fame, I to St. Albanes in the Euening came, Where Master Taylor, at the Sarazens head, Vnask'd (vnpaid for) me both lodg'd and fed. The Tapsters, Hostlers, Chamberlaines, and all, Sau'd me a labour, that I need not call, The Iugges were fild &amp; fild, the cups went round, And in a word great kindnes there I found, For which both to my Cousin, and his men, Ile still be thankefull in word, deed, and pen. Till Thursday morning there I made my stay, And then I went plaine Dunstable high-way. My very heart with drought me thought did shrink, I went twelue miles, and no one bade me drinke. Which made me call to minde, that instant time, That Drunkennes was a most sinfull crime. When Puddle-hill I footed downe, and past A mile from thence, I found a Hedge at last. There stroke we sayle, our Bacon, Cheese, and Bread, We drew like Fidlers, and like Farmers fed, And whilst two houres we there did take our ease, My Nag made shift to mump greene Pulse &amp; Pease. Thus we our hungry stomacks did supply, And dranke the water of a Brooke hard by. Away t'ward Hockley in the hole, we make, When straight a Horsman did me ouer-take, Who knew me, &amp; would faine haue giuen me Coine. I said, my Bonds did me from Coyne inioyne, I thank'd and prayd him to put vp his Chinke, And willingly I wisht it drownd in drinke. Away rode he, but like an honest man, I found at Hockley standing at the Swan, A formall Tapster, with a Iugge and glasse, Who did arest me: I most willing was To try the Action, and straight put in bale, My fees were paid before, with sixe-pence Ale. To quit this kindnesse, I most willing am, The man that paid for all, his name is Dam, At the Greene-dragon, against Grayes-Inne gate, He liues in good repute, and honest state. I foreward went in this my roauing race, To Stony Stratford I toward night did pace, My minde was fixed through the Towne to passe, To finde some lodging in the Hay or Grasse, But at the Queenes-Armes, from the window there, A comfortable voyce I chanc'd to heare, Call Taylor, Taylor, and be hang'd come hither, I look'd for small intreaty and went thither, There were some friends, which I was glad to see Who knew my Iourney; lodg'd, and boorded me. On Friday morne, as I would take my way, My friendly Host intreated me to stay, Because it rain'd, he told me I should haue Meate, Drinke, &amp; Horse-meate and not pay or craue. I thank'd him, and for's loue remaine his debter, But if I liue, I will requite him better. (From Stony Stratford) the way hard with stones, Did founder me, and vexe me to the bones, In blustring weather, both for winde and raine, Through Tocetter I trotted with much paine, Two miles from thence, we sat vs downe &amp; dinde, Well bulwark'd by a hedge, from raine and winde We hauing fed, away incontinent, With weary pace toward Dauentry we went. Foure miles short of it, one o're-tooke me there, And told me he would leaue a Iugge of Beere, At Dauentry at the Horse-shoe for my vse. I thought it no good manners to refuse, But thank'd him, for his kinde vnasked gift, Whilst I was lame as scarce a leg could lift, Came limping after to that stony Towne, Whose hard streets made me almost halt rightdown. There had my friend perform'd the words he said, And at the doore a Iugge of liquor staide, The folkes were all inform'd, before I came, How, and wherefore my iourney I did frame, Which caused mine Hostesse from her doore come out, (Hauing a great Wart rampant on her snowt.) The Tapsters, Hostlers, one another call, The Chamberlaines with admiration all, Were fild with wonder, more then wonderfull, As if some Monster sent from the Mogull, Some Elephant from Africke, I had beene, Or some strange beast from th' Amazonian Queene. As Buzzards, Widgions, Woodcocks, &amp; such fowle, Doe gaze and wonder at the broad-fac'd Owle, So did these brainelesse Asses, all-amaz'd, With admirable Non sence talk'd and gaz'd. They knew my state (although not told by me) That I could scarcely goe, they all could see, They dranke of my Beere, that to me was giuen, But gaue me not a drop to make all euen, And that which in my minde was most amisse, My Hostesse she stood by and saw all this, Had she but said, Come neere the house, my friend, For this day here shall be your Iourneyes end, Then had she done the thing which did not, And I in kinder wordes had paid the shor. I doe intreat my friends, (as I haue some) If they to Dauentry doe chance to come, That they will balke that Inne; or if by chance, Or accident into that house they glance, Kinde Gentlemen, as they by you reape profit, My Hostesse care of me, pray tell her of it. Yet doe not neither: Lodge there when you will, You for your money shall be welcome still. From thence that night, although my bones were sore, I made a shift to hobble seu'n miles more: The way to Dunchurch, foule with dirt and mire, Able, I thinke, both man and horse to tire. On Dunsmore Heath, a hedge doth there enclose Grounds, on the right hand, there I did repose. Wits whetstone, want, there made vs quickly learn, With kniues to cut down Rushes, &amp; greene Fearne, Of which we made a field-bed in the field, Which sleepe, and rest, and much content did yeeld. There with my mother Earth, I thought it fit To lodge, and yet no Incest did commit: My bed was Curtain'd with good wholesome ayres, And being weary, I went vp no stayres: The skie my Canopy, bright Phebe shinde, Sweet bawling Zephirus breath'd gentle winde, In heau'ns Star-Chamber I did lodge that night, Ten thousand Starres, me to my bed did light; There baracadoed with a bancke lay wee Below the lofty branches of a tree. There my bed-fellowes and companions were, My Man, my Horse, a Bull, foure Cowes, two Steere: But yet for all this most confused rowt, We had no bed-staues, yet we fell not out. Thus Nature, like an ancient free Vpholster, Did furnish vs with bedstead, bed, and bolster; And the kind skies, (for which high heau'n be thanked, Allow'd vs a large Couering and a Blanket: Auroras face gan light our lodging darke, We arose and mounted, with the mounting Larke, Through plashes, puddles, thicke, thinne, wet &amp; dry, I trauel'd to the Citie Couentry. There Master Doctor Holland caus'd me stay The day of Saturne, and the Sabbath day. Most friendly welcome, he did me afford, I was so entertain'd at bed and boord, Which as I dare not bragge how much it was, I dare not be ingrate and let it passe, But with thankes many I remember it, (In stead of his good deedes) in words and writ, He vs'd me like his sonne, more then a friend, And he on Munday his commends did send To Newhall, where a Gentleman did dwell, Who by his name is hight Sacheuerell. The Tuesday Iulyes one and twentieth day, I to the Citie Lichfield tooke my way, At Sutton Coffill with some friends I met, And much adoe I had from thence to get, There I was almost put vnto my trumps, My Horses shooes were worne as thinne as pumps; But noble Uulcan, a mad smuggy Smith, All reparations me did furnish with. The shooes were well remou'd, my Palfrey shod, And he referr'd the payment vnto God. I found a friend, when I to Lichfield came, A Ioyner, and Iohn Piddock is his name, He made me welcome, for he knew my iaunt, And he did furnish me with good prouant: He offred me some money, I refus'd it, And so I tooke my leaue, with thankes excus'd it. That Wednesday, I a weary way did passe, Raine, wind, stones, dirt, and dabbling dewie grasse, With here and there a pelting scatter'd village, Which yeelded me no charity, or pillage: For all the day, nor yet the night that followed. One drop of drinke I'm sure my gullet swallowed. At night I came t'a stony Towne call'd Stone. Where I knew none, nor was I knowne of none: I therefore through the streets held on my pace, Some two miles farther to some resting place: At last I spide a meddow newly mowde, The hay was rotten, the ground halfe o're-flowde: We made a breach, and entred horse and man, There our pauillion, we to pitch began, Which we erected with greene Broome and Hay, T'expell the cold, and keepe the raine away; The skie all muffled in a cloud gan lowre, And presently there fell a mighty showre, Which without intermission downe did powre, From ten a night, vntill the mornings foure. We all that time close in our couch did lye, Which being well compacted kept vs dry. The worst was, we did neither sup nor sleepe, And so a temperate dyet we did keepe. The morning all enrob'd in drisling fogges, We being as ready as we had bin dogges: We neede not stand vpon long ready making, But gaping, stretching, &amp; our eares well shaking: And for I found my Host and Hostesse kinde, I like a true man left my sheetes behinde. That Thursday morne, my weary course I fram'd, Vnto a Towne that is Newcastle nam'd. (Not that Newcastle standing vpon Tine) But this Towne scituation doth confine Neere Cheshire, in the famous County Stafford, And for their loue, I owe them not a straw for't; But now my versing Muse craues some repose, And whilst she sleeps Ile spowt a little prose. And now with sleep my Muse hath eas'd her braine, I'le turne my stile from prose, to verse againe. That which we could not haue, we freely spar'd, And wanting drinke, most soberly we far'd. We had great store of fowle (but 'twas foule way) And kindly euery step entreates me stay, The clammy clay sometimes my heeles would trip, One foot went foreward, th'other backe would slip. This weary day, when I had almost past, I came vnto Sir Urian Legh's at last, At Adlington, neere Macksfield he doth dwell, Belou'd, respected, and reputed well. Through his great loue, my stay with him was fixt, From Thursday night, till noone on Monday next, At his owne table I did daily eate, Whereat may be suppos'd, did want no meat, He would haue giu'n me gold or siluer either, But I with many thankes, receiued neither. And thus much without flattery I dare sweare, He is a Knight beloued farre and neere. First, he's beloued of his God aboue, (which loue, he loues to keep, beyond all loue) Next with a Wife and Children he is blest, Each hauing Gods feare planted in their brest. With faire Demaines, Reuennue of good Lands, He's fairely blest by the Almighties hands. And as he's happy in these outward things, So from his inward mind continuall springs Fruits of deuotion, deedes of Piety, Good hospitable workes of Charity, Iust in his Actions, constant in his word, And one that wonne his honour with the sword. Hee's no Carranto, Capr'ing, Carpet Knight, But he knowes when, and how to speake or fight. I cannot flatter him, say what I can, He's euery way a compleat Gentleman. I write not this, for what he did to me, But what mine eares, and eyes did heare and see, Nor doe I pen this to enlarge his fame, But to make others imitate the same. For like a Trumpet were I pleasd to blow, I would his worthy worth more amply show, But I already feare haue beene too bold, And craue his pardon, me excusd to hold. Thankes to his Sonnes and seruants euery one, Both males and females all, excepting none. To beare a letter he did me require, Neere Manchester, vnto a good Esquire: His kinsman Edmond Prestwitch, he ordain'd, That I was at Manchester entertain'd Two nights, and one day, ere we thence could passe, For men &amp; horse, rost, boyl'd, and oates, and grasse: This Gentleman not onely gaue harbor, But in the morning sent to me his Barbor, Who lau'd, and shau'd me, still I spar'd my purse, Yet sure he left me many a haire the worse. But in conclusion, when his worke was ended, His Glasse inform'd, my face was much amended. And for the kindnesse he to me did show, God grant his Customers beards faster grow, That though the time of yeere be deare or cheape, From fruitfull faces he may mowe and reape. Then came a Smith, with shooes, &amp; Tooth &amp; Nayle, He searchd my horse hooues, m?ding what did faile, Yet this I note, my Nag, through stones and dirt, Did shift shooes twice, ere I did shift one shirt: Can these kind things be in obliuion hid? No, Master Prestwitch, this and much more did, His friendship did command and freely gaue All before writ, and more then I durst craue. But leauing him a little, I must tell, How men of Manchester did vse me well, Their loues they on the tenter-hookes did racke, Rost, boyld, bak'd, too too much, white, claret, sacke, Nothing they thought too heauy or too hot, Canne follow'd Canne, and Pot succeeded Pot, That what they could do, all they though too little, Striuing in loue the Traueller to whittle. We went into the house of one Iohn Pinners, (A man that liues amongst a crue of sinners) And there eight seuerall sorts of Ale we had, All able to make one starke drunke or mad. But I with courage brauely flinched not, And gaue the Towne leaue to discharge the shot. We had at one time set vpon the Table, Good Ale of Hisope, 'twas no Esope fable: Then had we Ale of Sage, and Ale of Malt, And Ale of Woorme-wood, that could make one halt, With Ale of Rosemary, and Bettony, And two Ales more, or else I needs must lye. But to conclude this drinking Alye tale, We had a sort of Ale, called Scuruy Ale. Thus all these men, at their owne charge &amp; cost, Did striue whose loue should be expressed most. And farther to declare their boundlesse loues, They saw I wanted, and they gaue me Gloues, In deed, and very deed, their loues were such. That in their praise I cannot write too much; They merit more then I haue here compil'd, I lodged at the Eagle and the Child, Whereas my Hostesse, (a good ancient woman) Did entertaine me with respect, not common. She caus'd my Linnen, Shirts, and Bands be washt, And on my way she caus'd me be refresht, She gaue me twelue silke points, she gaue me Baken, Which by me much refused, at last was taken, In troath she prou'd a mother vnto me, For which, I euermore will thankefull be. But when to minde these kindnesses I call, Kinde Master Prestwitch Author is of all, And yet Sir Urian Leigh's good Commendation, Was the maine ground of this my Recreation. From both of them, there what I had, I had, Or else my entertainment had bin bad. O all you worthy men of Manchester, (True bred bloods of the County Lancaster) When I forget what you to me haue done, Then let me head-long to confusion runne. To Noble Master Prestwitch I must giue Thankes, vpon thankes, as long as I doe liue, His loue was such, I ne'r can pay the score, He farre surpassed all that went before, A horse and man he sent, with boundlesse bounty, To bring me quite through Lancasters large County, Which I well know is fifty miles at large, And he defrayed all the cost and charge. This vnlook'd pleasure, was to me such pleasure, That I can ne'r expresse my thankes with measure. So Mistresse Saracoale, Hostesse kinde, And Manchester with thankes I left behinde. The Wednesday being Iulyes twenty nine, My Iourney I to Preston did confine, All the day long it rained but one showre, Which from the Morning to the Eue'n did powre, And I, before to Preston I could get, Was sowsd, and pickeld both with raine and sweat. But there I was supply'd with fire and food, And any thing I wanted sweet and good. There, at the Hinde, kinde Master Hinde mine Host, Kept a good table, bak'd and boyld, and rost, There Wednesday, Thursday, Friday I did stay, And hardly got from thence on Saturday. Vnto my Lodging often did repaire, Kinde Master Thomas Banister, the Mayor, Who is of worship, and of good respect, And in his charge discreet and circumspect. For I protest to God I neuer saw, A Towne more wisely Gouern'd by the Law. They told me when my Soueraigne there was last, That one mans rashnes seem'd to giue distast. It grieu'd them all, but when at last they found, His Maiestie was pleasd, their ioyes were crown'd. He knew, the fairest Garden hath some weedes, He did accept their kinde intents, for deedes: One man there was, that with his zeale too hot, And furious haste, himselfe much ouer-shot. But what man is so foolish, that desires To get good fruit from thistles, thornes and bryers? Thus much I thought good to demonstrate here, Because I saw how much they grieued were; That any way, the least part of offence, Should make them seeme offensiue to their Prince. Thus three nights was I staid and lodg'd in Preston, And saw nothing ridiculous to iest on, Much cost and charge the Mayor vpon me spent, And on my way two miles, with me he went, There (by good chance) I did more friendship get, The vnder Shriefe of Lancashire we met, A Gentleman that lou'd, and knew me well, And one whose bounteous mind doth beare the bell. There, as if I had bin a noted thiefe, The Mayor deliuered me vnto the Shriefe. The Shriefes authority did much preuaile, He sent me vnto one that kept the Iayle. Thus I perambuling, poore Iohn Taylor, Was giu'n from Mayor to Shriefe, from Shriefe to Iaylor, The Iaylor kept an Inne, good beds, good cheere, Where paying nothing, I found nothing deere: For the vnder Shriefe kind Master Couill nam'd, (A man for house-keeping renown'd and fam'd) Did cause the Towne of Lancaster afford Me welcome, as if I had beene a Lord. And 'tis reported, that for daily bounty, His mate can scarce be found in all that County. Th'extremes of mizer, or of prodigall, He shunnes, and liues discreet and liberall, His wiues minde, and his owne are one, so fixt, That Argus eyes could see no oddes betwixt, And sure the difference, (if there difference be) Is who shall doe most good, or he, or she. Poore folks report, that for relieuing them, He and his wife, are each of them a Iem; At th'Inne, and at his house two nights I staide, And what was to be paid, I know he paide; If nothing of their kindnesse I had wrote, Ingratefull me the world might iustly note: Had I declar'd all I did heare, and see, For a great flatt'rer then I deemd should be, Him and his wife, and modest daughter Besse, With Earth, and Heau'ns felicity, God blesse. Two dayes a man of his, at his command, Did guide me to the midst of Westmerland, And my Conductor with a liberall fist, To keepe me moist, scarce any Alehouse mist. The fourth of August (weary, halt, and lame) We in the darke, t'a Towne call'd Sebder came, There Master Borrowd, my kind honest Host, Vpon me did bestow vnasked cost. The next day I held on my iourney still, Sixe miles vnto a place call'd Carling hill, Where Master Edmond Branthwaite doth recide, Who made me welcome, with my man and guide. Our entertainement, and our fare was such, It might haue satisfied our betters much; Yet all too little was, his kind heart thought, And fiue miles on my way himselfe me brought, At Orton he, I, and my man did dine, With Master Corney a good true Diuine, And surely Master Branthwait's well belou'd, His firme integrity is much approu'd: His good effects, doe make him still affected Of God and good men, (with regard) respected. He sent his man with me, o're Dale and Downe, Who lodg'd, and boorded me at Peereth Towne, And such good cheere, and bedding there I had, That nothing, (but my weary selfe) was bad; There a fresh man, (I know not for whose sake) With me a iourney would to Carlile make: But from that Citie, about two miles wide, Good Sir Iohn Dalston lodg'd me and my guide. Of all the Gentlemen in Englands bounds, His house is neerest to the Scottish grounds, And Fame proclaimes him, farre and neere, aloud, He's free from being couetous, or proud: His sonne Sir George, most affable, and kinde, His fathers image, both in forme and minde, On Saturday to Carlile both did ride, Where (by their loues and leaues) I did abide, Where of good entertainment I found store, From one that was the Mayor the yeere before, His name is Master Adam Robinson, I the last English friendship with him won. He (gratis) My thankes to Sir Iohn and Sir George Dalstone, with Sir Henry Gurwin. found a guide to bring me through, From Carlile to the Citie Endenborough: This was a helpe, that was a helpe alone, Of all my helps inferiour vnto none. Eight miles from Carlile runs a little Riuer, Which Englands bounds, from Scotlands gro?ds doth seuer. Ouer Esk I waded.Without Horse, Bridge, or Boate, I o're did get On foot, I went, yet scarce my shooes did wet. I being come to this long-look'd-for land, Did marke, remarke, note, renote, viewd and scand: And I saw nothing that could change my will, But that I thought my selfe in England still. The Kingdomes are so neerely ioyn'd and fixt, There scarcely went a paire of Sheares betwixt; There I saw skie aboue, and earth below, And as in England, there the Sunne did show: The hills with Sheepe repleate, with corne the dale, The afore named Knights had giuen money to my Guide, of which he left some part at euery Ale-house.And many a cottage yeelded good Scott'sh Ale; This County (Anandale) in former times, Was the curst climate of rebellious crimes: For Cumberland and it, both Kingdomes borders, Were euer ordred, by their owne disorders, Such sharking, shifting, cutting throats, &amp; thieuing, Each taking pleasure in th'others grieuing; And many times he that had wealth to night, Was by the morrow morning beggerd quite: To many yeeres this pell-mell fury lasted, That all these borders were quite spoyl'd &amp; wasted, Confusion, hurly-burly raign'd and reuel'd, The Churches with the lowly ground were leueld; All memorable monuments defac'd, All places of defence o'rethrowne and rac'd. That who so then did in the borders dwell, Liu'd little happier then those in hell. But since the all-disposing God of heauen. Hath these two Kingdomes to one Monarch giuen, Blest peace, and plenty on them both hath showr'd, Exile, and hanging hath the theeues deuowr'd, That now each subiect may securely sleepe, His Sheep &amp; Neate, the black the white doth keepe, For now those Crownes are both in one combinde, Those former borders, that each one confinde, Appeares to me (as I doe vnderstand) To be almost the Center of the Land, This was a blessed heauen expounded riddle, To thrust great Kingdomes skirts into the middle. Long may the instrumentall cause suruiue, From him and his, succession still deriue True heires vnto his vertues, and his Throane, That these two Kingdomes euer may be one. This County of all Scotland is most poore, By reason of the outrages before, Yet mighty store of Corne I saw there growe, And as good grasse as euer man did mowe: And as that day I twenty miles did passe, I saw eleuen hundred Neat at grasse, By which may be coniectur'd at the least, That there was sustenance for man and beast. And in the Kingdome I haue truly scand, There's many worser parts, are better mand. For in the time that theeuing was in vre, The Gentles fled to places more secure. And left the poorer sorte, t'abide the paine, Whilest they could ne'r finde time to turne againe. That Shire of Gentlemen is scarce and dainty, Yet there's reliefe in great aboundance plenty, Twixt it and England, little oddes I see, They eate, and liue, and strong and able bee, So much in Verse, and now Ile change my stile, And seriously I'le write in Prose a while. I that haue wasted, M?ths, weeks, dayes, &amp; houres In viewing Kingdomes, Countries, Townes, and tow'rs, Without al measure, measuring many paces, And with my pen describing many places, With few additions of mine owne deuizing, (Because I haue a smacke of Coriatizing) Our Mandeuill, Primaleon, Don Quixot, Great Amadis, or Huon, traueld not As I haue done, or beene where I haue beene, Or heard and seene, what I haue heard and seene; Nor Britaines Odcombe (Zany braue Ulissis) In all his ambling, saw the like as this is. I was in (would I could describe it well) A darke, light, pleasant, profitable hell, And as by water I was wafted in, I thought that I in Charons Boate had bin, But being at the entrance landed thus, Three men there (in stead of Cerberus) Conuaid me in, in each one hand a light To guide vs in that vault of endlesse night, There young &amp; old with glim'ring candles burning Digge, delue, and labour, turning and returning, Some in a hole with baskets and with baggs, Resembling furies, or infernall haggs: There one like Tantall feeding, and there one, Like Sisiphus he rowles the restlesse stone. Yet all I saw was pleasure mixt with profit, Which prou'd it to be no tormenting Tophet: For in this honest, worthy, harmelesse hell, There ne'r did any damned Deuill dwell: And th'Owner of it gaines by 't more true glory, Then Rome doth by fantasticke Purgatory. A long mile thus I past, down, downe, steepe, steepe, In deepenesse far more deepe, then Neptunes deepe, Whilst o're my head (in fourefold stories hie) Was Earth, &amp; Sea, &amp; Ayre, and Sun, and Skie: That had I dyed in that Cimerian roome, Foure Elements had couered o're my tombe: Thus farther then the bottome did I goe, (And many Englishmen haue not done so;) Where mounting Porposes, and mountaine Whales, And Regiments of fish with finnes and Scales, Twixt me and Heauen did freely glide and slide, And where great ships may at an anchor ride: Thus in by Sea, and out by land I past, And tooke my leaue of good Sir George at last. VVhy should I waste Inuention to endite, Ouidian fictions, or Olympiam games? My misty Muse enlightned with more light, To a more noble pitch her ayme she frames. I must relate to my great Master Iames, The Calydonian annuall peacefull warre; How noble mindes doe eternize their fames, By martiall meeting in the Brea of Marr: How thousand gallant Spirits came neere and farre, With Swords &amp; Targets, Arrowes, Bowes, &amp; Guns, That all the Troope to men of iudgement, are The God of Warres great neuer conquered Sonnes. The Sport is Manly, yet none bleed but Beasts, And last the Victor on the vanquisht feasts. If Sport like this can on the Mountaines be, Where Phebus flames can neuer melt the Snow: Then let who list delight in Vales below, Skie-kissing Mountaines pleasure are for me: What brauer obiect can mans eye-sight see, Then Noble, Worshipfull, and worthy Wights, As if they were prepard for sundry fights, Yet all in sweet society agree? Through heather, mosse, m?gst frogs, &amp; bogs, &amp; fogs, 'Mongst craggy cliffes, &amp; thunder battered hills, Harts, Hinds, Bucks, Roes are chas'd by Men &amp; dogs, Where two houres hunting fourscore fat Deere kills. Low land, your Sports are low as is your Seate, The High-land Games &amp; Minds, are high and great. THE EPILOGVE TO ALL MY ADVENTVRERS AND OTHERS. Thus did I neither spend, or begge, or aske, By any course, direct or indirectly: But in each tittle I perform'd my taske, According to my bill most circumspectly. I vow to God, I haue done Scotland wrong, (And (iustly) 'gainst me it may bring an Action) I haue not giuen't that right which doth belong, For which I am halfe guilty of detraction: Yet had I wrote all things that there I saw, Misiudging censures would suppose I flatter, And so my name I should in question draw, Where Asses bray, and prattling Pies doe chatter: Yet (arm'd with truth) I publish with my Pen, That there th'Almighty doth his blessings heape, In such aboundant food for Beasts and Men; That I ne're saw more plenty or more cheape. Thus what mine eyes did see, I doe beleeue; And what I doe beleeue, I know is true: And what is true, vnto your hands I giue, That what I giue, may be beleeu'd of you. But as for him that sayes I lye or dote, I doe returne, and turne the Lye in's throate. Thus Gentlemen, amongst you take my ware, You share my thankes, and I your moneyes share. Yours in all obseruance and gratefulnesse, euer to be commanded, Io: Taylor. FINIS.

Trim Tram Senceles, GREAT IMAGE OF AVTHORITY and Hedgborough of the famous City of Goteham, and to the rest of that admired and vnmatchable Senate, with their Corruptions and Families. SIR Gregory Nonsence HIS NEWES FROM NO PLACE. It was in Iune the eight and thirtieth day, That I imbarked was on highgate Hill, After discourteous friendly taking leaue: Of my young Father Madge and Mother Iohn, The Wind did ebbe, the tide flou'd North Southeast, We hoist our Sailes of Colloquintida. And after 13. dayes and 17. nights, (With certaine Hiroglyphicke houres to boot) We with tempestuous calmes, and friendly stormes, Split our maine top-mast, close below the keele. But I with a dull quicke congruity, Tooke 19. ounces of the Westerne winde, And with the pith of the pole Artichocke, Saild by the flaming Coast of Trapezond, There in a Fort of melting Adamant, Arm'd in a Crimson Robe, as blacke as Iet, I saw Alcides with a Spiders thred, Lead Cerberus to the Prononticke Sea, Then cutting further through the marble Maine, Mongst flying Buls, and 4. leg'd Turkicocks, A dumbe faire spoken, welfac'd aged youth, Sent to me from the stout Stimphalides, With tonguelesse silence thus began his speech: Illustrious flap-iacke, to thy hungry doome, Low as the ground I eleuate my cause, As I vpon a Gnat was riding late, In quest to parley with the Pleiades, I saw the Duke of Hounsditch gaping close, In a greene Arbour made of yellow starch, Betwixt two Brokers howling Madrigales, A Banquet was serued in of Lampraies bones, Well pickel'd in the Tarbox of old time, When Demogorgon saild to Islington; Which I perceiuing with nine chads of steele, Straight flew vnto the coast of Pimlico. T'informe great Prester Iohn, and the Mogull, What exlent Oysters were at Billingsgate. The Mogull (all inraged with these newes,) Sent a blacke snaile post to Tartaria, To tell the Irishmen in Saxony, The dismall downefall of old Charing Crosse. With that nine butter Firkins in a flame, Did coldly rise to Arbitrate the cause: Guessing by the Sinderesis of Wapping, Saint Thomas Watrings is most ominous. For though an Andiron, and a paire of Tongs, May both haue breeding from one teeming womb, Yet by the Calculation of Pickt-hatch, Milke must not be so deere as Muskadell. First shall Melpomene in Cobweb Lawne Adorne great Memphis in a Mussell boat, And all the muses clad in Robes of Ayre, Shall dance, Leuoltons with a Whirligig, Faire Pluto shall descend from Brazen Dis, And Poliphemus keepe a Seamsters shop, The Ile of Wight shall like a diue-dapper, Deuoure the Egyptian proud Piramides, Whilst Cassia Fistula shall gurmundize, Vpon the flesh and bloud of Croydon cole dust, Then on the bankes of Shoreditch shall be seene, What 'tis to serue the great Vtopian Queene. This fearefull period with great ioyfull care, Was heard with acclamations, and in fine, The whilst a lad of aged Nestors yeeres, Stood sitting in a Throne of massy yeast: (Not speaking any word) gaue this reply: Most conscript Vmpire in this various Orbe, I saw the Cædars of old, Lebanon, Read a sad Lecture vnto Clapham heath, At which time a strange vision did appeare, His head was Buckrum, and his eyes were sedge, His armes were blue bottles, his teeth were straw, His legs were nine wel squar'd Tobacco Pipes, Cloath'd in a garment all of Dolphins egges, Then with a voyce erected to the ground, Lifting aloft his hands vnto his feet, He thus beganne, Cease friendly cutting throtes, Clamor the Promulgation of your tongues, And yeeld to Demagorgons policy. Stop the refulgent method of your moodes, For should you liue old Paphlagonias yeeres, And with Sardanapalus match in vertue. Yet Atropos will with a Marigold, Runne through the Mountains of the Caspian Sea. When you shall see aboue you and beneath, That nothing kils a man so soone as death, Aquarius ioyn'd with Pisces, in firme league, With Reasons and vindictiue Arguments, That pulueriz'd the King of Diamonds, And with a diogoricall relapse, Squeaz'd through the Sinders of a Butterflye, Great Oberon was mounted on a Waspe, To signifie this newes at Dunstable. The Weathercock at Pancrage in a fume, With Patience much distracted hearing this, Repli'd thus briefly without feare or wit, What madnesse doth thy Pericranion seaze, Beyond the Dragons taile Artyphilax. Think'st thou a Wolfe thrust through a sheep-skin, gloue, Can make me take this Gobling for a Lambe: Or that a Crocadile in Barly broth, Is not a dish to feast don Belzebub, Giue me a Medler in a field of blue, Wrapt vp stigmatically in a dreame, And I will send him to the gates of Dis, To cause him fetch a sword of massie Chalke, With which he wan the fatall Theban field, From Romes great mitred Metropolitan. Much was the quoile this brauing answere made, When presently a German Coniurer, Did ope a learned Booke of Palmistry, Cram'd full of mentall reseruations: The which beginning with a loud low voyce, With affable and kind discourtesie, He spake what no man heard or vnderstood, Words tending vnto this or no respect, Spawne of a Tortoyse hold thy silent noyse, For when the great Leuiathan of Trumps, Shall make a breach in Sinons Tennis Court. Then shall the pigmey mighty Hercules, Skip like a wildernesse in Woodstreet Counter, Then Taurus shall in league with Hanniball, Draw Bacchus dry, whilst Boreas in a heat, Inuellop'd in a Gowne of Isicles: With much discretion and great want of wit, Leaue all as wisely as it was at first. I mused much how those things could be done. When straite a water Tankard answer'd me, That it was made with a Parenthesis, With thirteene yards of Kersie and a halfe, Made of fine flaxe which grew on Goodwinsands, Whereby we all perceiu'd the Hernshawes breed, Being trusted with a charitable doome, Was neere Bunhill, when strait I might discry, The Quintescence of Grubstreet, well distild Through Cripplegate in a contagious Map. Bright Phaeton all angry at the sight, Snatcht a large Wool-packe from a pismires mouth. And in a Taylors Thimble boi'ld a Cabbage. Then all the standers by, most Reuerend, Rude, Iudg'd the case was most obscure and cleere, And that three salt Ennigmates well appli'd, With fourescoure Pipers and Arions Harpe, Might catch Garagantua through an augor-hole, And twas no doubt but mulley Mahamet, Would make a quaffing bowle of Gorgons skul, Whilst gormundizing Tantalus would weepe, That Polipheme should kisse Auroraes lips, Tri-formed Cinthia in a Sinkefoile shape, Met with the Dogstarre on Saint Dauids day, But said Grimalkin mumbling vp the Alpes, Made fifteene fustian fumes of Pasticrust. This was no sooner knowne at Amsterdam, But with an Ethiopian Argosey, Man'd with Flap-dragons, drinking vpsifreeze; They past the purple gulfe of Basingstoke. This being finisht, search to any end, A full odde number of iust sixteene dogs, Drencht in a sulpher flame of scalding Ice, Sung the Besonian Whirlepooles of Argeire, Mixt with pragmaticall potato Pies, With that I turn'd my eares to see these things, And on a Christall wall of Scarlet dye, I with mine eyes began to heare and note, What these succeeding Verses might portend, Which furiously an Anabaptist squeak'd, The audience deafly listning all the while. A most learned-Lye, and Illiterate Oration, in lame galloping Rime. fustianly pronounced by Nimshag, a Gimnosophicall Phoolosopher, in the presence of Achittophel Smel-smocke, Annani-Asse Aretine, Iscariot-Nabal, Fransiscus Ra-viliaco, Garnetto Iebusito, Guido Salpetro Fauexit Pouderio, and many other graue Senators of Limbo. Translated out of the vulgar Language, of Terra incognita, and is as materiall as any part of the Booke, the meaning whereof a blind man may see without Spectacles as well at midnight, as at noone day. The Story of Ricardo, and of Bindo, Appear'd like Nylus peeping through a window, Which put the wandring Iew in much amazement, In seeing such a voyce without the Cazement, When loe a Bull, (long nourish'd in Cocitus, With sulphure hornes, sent by the Emp'rour Titus, Ask'd a stigmatike Paraclesian question, If Alexander euer lou'd Ephestion. I seeing each to other were much aduerse, In mirth and sport set down their minds in sad verse. Which as my brains with care haue coin'd &amp; minted, With plenteous want of iudgment here tis printed, But if Grimalkine take my line in dudgion, The case is plaine, I pray good Readers iudge ye on, That Esop that old fabulisticke Phrygian, From the Nocturnall floud or lake cal'd Stigian, Came to the Court at Creete, clad like a Legate, The Porter kindly to him open'd the-Gate, He past through Plutoes Hall in Hell most horrid, Where gnashing cold mixt with combustious torid, Where all things that are good &amp; goodnes wanted, Where plants of mans perdition still are planted, Where Ghosts and Goblings all in sulphure suted, And all the fiends like Cuckolds were cornuted. At last he audience got in Plutoes presence, And of his whole Embassage this was the sence: To thee Tartarian Monarch now my Rime-is, And therefore marke my Prologue, or Imprimis, Thou that in Limbo art as 'twere Rex Regnant, Beare with my wit, which is not sharp or pregnant, I come fr? Ho?dsditch, Long-laine, &amp; fr? Bridewel, Where all that haue liu'd ill, haue all not dide well, Where as the Vices shew like Vertues Cardinall, Where's mony store and conscience very hard in al, Through thy protection they are m?strous thriuers, Not like the Dutchmen in base Doyts and Stiuers, For there you may see many a greedy grout-head, Without or wit, or sence, almost without-head, Held and esteem'd a man whose zeale is feruent, And makes a shew as he were not your seruant. To tell this newes I came from many a mile hence, For we doe know ther's ods twixt talke and silence. With that the smug-fac'd Pluto shook his vestment, Deepe ruminating what the weighty Iest ment, Calling to mind old Dodonæus Hearball, With Taciturnity and Actions verball, Quoth he, I care for neither Friend or Kinsman, Nor doe I value honesty two pinnes man: But 'tis a Maxime Mortals cannot hinder, The doughty deeds of Wakefields huffe cap Pinder, Are not so pleasant as the faire Aurora, When Nimrod rudely plaid on his Bandora. For 'tis not fit that any Turke or Persian, Should in a Cloke-bag hide a feauer Tertian, Because the Dog-starre in his cold Meridian, Might arme himselfe in fury most quotidian. With that, most quick a Pettifoggers tongue went, (Well oild with Aurum, Argent, or such Vnguent) Is't fit (quoth he) here should be such innroachment, By such whose fathers ne'r knew what a Coach ment; Or shal their Scutchions fairly be indorsed, Who riding backward iadishly were horsed; For though in India it be rare and frequent, Where to the wall most commonly the weak went, Yet neither can the Soldan or the Sophy, Shew any Presidents for such a Trophy. By Rules of Logicke, he's a kind a Catiue, And makes no reckoning of his Country natiue, That doth with feeble strength, loue with derision. And without bloudshed makes a deepe incision, Why should a man lay either life or lim ny, To be endangered by a falling Chimney. For though the prosecution may be quaintly, Yet may the execution end but faintly, Let's call to mind the famous acts of Hector, When aged Ganymede carousing Nectar, Did leaue the Greekes much matter to repine on; Vntill the Woodden Horse of trusty Synon, Foald a whole litter of mad Colts in Harnesse, As furious as the host of Holophernes. But to the purpose here's the long and short ont, All that is said hath not beene much important, Nor can it be that what is spoke is meant all, Of any thing that happens accidentall. We will examine wisely what the Foe sent, And whether he be innocent or nocent. In weighty matters let's not be too serious, Ther's many an Eunuch hath bin thought venerious, And 'tis a thing which often hath bin heard on, That he that labours, doth deserue his Guerdon. Let vs the first precadent time examine, Youle find that hunger is the cause of famine, The Birds in Summer that haue sweetly chirped, Ere winter hath beene done, haue beene extirped. He may weare Robes, that nere knew what a Rag m?t, And he that feasts, may fast without a fragm?t, The end proues all, I care not for the Interim, Time now that summers him, wil one day winter him. To outward view, and Senses all exterier, Amongst all fooles I neuer saw a verier, Then he that doth his liberty prohibit, To fall in danger of a fatall Iibbit. Nor for this purpose here to talke come I, How siluer may be mock't with Alcamy. I oft haue heard that many a Hawke hath muted, Whereby the Faulkners Clothes haue bin polluted. This may be auoyded if the Knight Sir Reuerence, Be wary with a negligent perseuerance: For men of Iudgement neuer thinke it decent, To loue a stinking Pole-cat well for the sent. But if a man should seriously consider, Where Charity is fled or who hath hid her, He in the end would giue this worthy sentence, The earth hath beene accursed since she went hence. The times are biting, and the dayes Caniculer, And mischiefe girds about the Globes orbiculer, How from the Countrey all the plaine Rusticity, Liues by deceit, exiling plaine simplicity. A face like Rubies mix'd with Alablaster, Wastes much in Physicke, and her water-caster, That whosoe'r perceiues which way the stink went May sent and censure shee's a great delinquent. Why should a Bawd be furr'd with Budge &amp; Miniuer. As if she were a Lady, or Queene Guiniuer, When as perhaps there's many a modest Matron, Hath scarcely meat, or money, clothes, or patron? And wherefore should a man be growne so stupid; To be a slaue to Venus or to Cupid? Hee's but a foole that hoping for a vaine prize, Being captiued can haue no baile or maine prize. For he that hath no shift let him determine, He shall be bitten with Fleas, Lice, or vermine. This being all his speeches, Pia Mater, He call'd a Sculler, and would goe by water: When straite the Stygian Ferriman a rare one, Old amiable currish curteous Caron, Row'd with a whirl-wind through the Acheron tick, And thence vnto the Azure Sea proponticke, There Neptune in a burning blue Pauilion, In state did entertaine this slow Postillion, There Proteus in a Robe of twisted Camphire, With a graue beard of monumentall Samphire, Quoth he, shall we whose Ancestors were war-like, Whose rich Perfumes were only Leeks and Garlike, Whose noble deeds nocturnall and diurnall, Great Towns and Towers did topsie turuy turne al, Shall all their valour be in vs extinguish'd? Great Ioue forbid, there should be such a thing wish'd, Though Cleopatra was Octauian's riuall. It is a thing that we may well conniue all, Amongst the Ancient it is vndisputable, That women and the winds were euer mutable, And 'tis approu'd where people are litigious, There euery Epicure is not religious, Old Oceamus knowing what they ment all, Brought Zephirus vnto the Orientall, And he by Argument would proue that loue is A thing that makes a wise man oft a Nouice: For tis approu'd, a Greyhound or a Beagle, Were not ordain'd or made to hunt the Eagle, Nor can the nimblest Cat that came from Gottam, Search the profundity of Neptunes bottom. Let roaring Cannons with the Welkin parley, It's known, good liquor may be made with Barley, And by experience many are assured, Some grounds are fruitfull, if they be manured. For in the rudiments of health or sanity, An arrant Whore is but a price of vanity: Some men with fury will procrastinate, And some with leaden speed make haste in at, But in conclusion many things impurely, Die in the birth, and neuer end maturely. The man that seeketh straying minds to weane all, From veniall vices, or offences penall: Had he the forces of the Turkish Nauy, He would ly downe at last and cry peccaui, Of one thing I haue oftentimes tooke notice, The foole that's old, and rich, much apt to dote is; And by the light of Pollux and of Castor, A Woolfe in Shepheards weeds is no good Pastor. Those that do liue a Commicke life by Magicke, Their Sceanes in their Catastrophes are tragick. And he that ore the world would be chiefe Primat, May giue occasion for wise men to rime at. Before men fell to wrangling disagreement, A Lawyer vnderstood not what a fee ment: It was a time when Guilt did feare no censure, But loue, and peace, and charity was then sure. Now fathers (for their bread) dig and delue it. The whilst the Satten Sons are lin'd with Veluet. Thus doe I make a hotch potch messe of Nonsence, In darke Enigmaes, and strange sence vpon sence: It is not foolish all, nor is it wise all, Nor is it true in all, nor is it lies all. I haue not shew'd my wits acute or fluent, Nor told which way of late the w?dring Iew went: For mine owne part I neuer cared greatly, (So I fare well) where those that dresse the meat lie. A miserable Knaue may be close fisted, And prodigall expence may be resisted, I neither care what Tom, or Iacke, or Dicke sed, I am resolu'd and my mind is fixed, The case is, not as he, or I, or you sed, Truth must be found, and witnesses produced, My care is, that no captious Reader beare hence, My vnderstanding, wit, or reason here-hence. On purpose to no purpose I did write all, And so at noone, I bid you here good night all. Then with a tuchbox of transalpine tarre, Turning thrice round, and stirring not a iot, He threw fiue tunne of red hot purple Snow, Into a Pigmeis mouth, nine inches square, Which strait with melancholly mou'd, Old Bembus Burgomaster of Pickt-hatch, That plunging through the Sea of Turnebull streete, He safely did ariue at Smithfield Barres. Then did the Turnetripes on the Coast of France, Catch fifteene hundred thousand Grashoppers, With foureteene Spanish Needles bumbasted, Poach'd with the Egs of fourscore Flanders Mares, Mounted vpon the foote of Caucasus, They whorld the football of conspiring fate, And brake the shinnes of smugfac'd Muleiber: With that grim Pluto all in Scarlet blue, Gaue faire Proserpina a kisse of brasse, At which all Hell danc'd Trenchmore in a string, Whilst Acheron, and Termagant did sing. The Mold-warp all this while in white broth bath'd, Did Carroll Didoes happinesse in loue, Vpon a Gridiron made of whiting-mops, Vnto the tune of Iohn come kisse me now, At which Auernus Musicke gan to rore, Inthron'd vpon a seat of three-leau'd grasse, Whilst all the Hibernian Kernes in multitudes, Did feast with Shamerags stew'd in Vsquebagh. At which a banquet made of Monopolies, Tooke great distaste, because the Pillory Was hunger-staru'd for want of Villianes eares, Whom to relieue, there was a Mittimus, Sent from Tartaria in an Oyster Boate, At which the King of China was amaz'd, And with nine graines of Rewbarbe stellified, As low as to the altitude of shame, He thrust foure Onions in a Candle-case, And spoild the meaning of the worlds misdoubt, Thus with a Dialogue of crimson starch, I was inflamed with a num-cold fire, Vpon the tenterhookes of Charlemaine, The Dogstar howld, the Cat a Mountaine smilde, And Sisiphus dranke Muskadell and Egges, In the hornd hoofe of huge Bucephalus, Time turn'd about, and shew'd me yesterday, Clad in a Gowne of mourning had I wist, The motion was almost too late they said, Whilst sad despaire made all the World starke mad, They all arose, and I put vp my pen, It makes no matter, where, why, how, or when. Some Sence at last to the Learned. You that in Greeke and Latine learned are, And of the ancient Hebrew haue a share, You that most rarely oftentimes haue sung In the French, Spanish, or Italian tongue, Here I in English haue imployd my pen, To be read by the learnedst Englishmen, Wherein the meanest Scholler plaine may see, I vnderstand their tongues, as they doe me.

Dog-dayes had begun to bite, On that day which doth blest Remembrance bring, The name of an Apostle, and our King, On that remarkeable good day, Saint Iames, I vndertooke my Voyage downe the Thames. The Signe in I obserue signes, windes, tides, dayes, houres, times, Sciruations and manners. Cancer, or the Ribs and Brest, And Æolus blew sweetly, West Southwest. Then after many farewels, Cups and Glasses, (Which oftentimes hath made men worse then Asses) About the waste or Noone if you'l take it so. Nauell of the Day, Not being dry or Drunke, I went my way. Our Wherry somewhat old, or strucke in age, That had endur'd neere 4. yeeres Pilgrimage, And carried honest people, Whores, and Thieues, Some Sergeants, Bayliffes, and some Boats are like Barbars Chayres, Hackneyes, or Whores: common to all estates. vnder-Shrieues, And now at last it was her lot to be Th'aduentrous bonny Barke to carry me. But as an old Whores Beauty being gone Hides Natures wracke, with Artlike painting on: So I with Colours finely did repaire My Boats defaults, and made her fresh and faire. Thus being furnish'd with good Wine and Beere, And Bread and Meat (to banish hungers feare) With Sayles, with Anker, Cables, Sculs and Oares, With Carde and Compasse, to know Seas &amp; Shores, With Lanthorne, Candle, Tinder-box and Match, And with good Courage, to work, ward, and watch, Wel man'd, wel ship'd, wel victual'd, wel appointed, Well in good health, well timbred and wel ioynted: All wholly well, and yet not halfe Fox'd well, Twixt Kent, and Essex, we to Grauesend fell. There I had welcome of my friendly Host, (A Grauesend Trencher, and a Grauesend Tost) Good meat and lodging at an easie rate, And rose betimes, although I lay downe late. Bright Lucifer the Messenger of Day, His burnisht twinkling splendour did display: Rose cheek'd Aurora hid her blushing face, She spying Phœbus comming gaue him place, Whilst Zephirus, and Auster, mix'd together, Breath'd gently, as fore-boding pleasant weather, Old Neptune had his Daughter Thames supplide, With ample measure of a flowing Tide, But Thames supposde it was but borrowed goods, And with her Ebbes, paid Neptune backe his Floods. Then at the time of this Auspicious dawning, I rowzd my men, who Scrubbing, stretching, yawning, Arose, left Grauesend, Rowing downe the streame, And neere to Lee, we to an Ancker came. Because the Sands were bare, and Water low, We rested there, till it two houres did Flow: And then to trauell went our Galley foyst, Our Ancker quickly weigh'd, our sayle vp hoyst, Where thirty miles we past, a mile from shore, The water two These flat Sands are called the Spits. foot deepe, or little more. Thus past we on the braue East Saxon Coast, From 3. at morne, till 2. at noone almost, By Shobury, Wakering, Fowlenesse, Tittingham, And then we into deeper water came. There is a crooked Bay runnes winding farre, To Maulden, Esterford, and Colchester, Which cause twas much about, (to ease mens paine) I left the Land, and put into the mayne. With speed, the crooked way to scape and passe, I made out strait for Frinton and the Nasse. But being 3. Leagues then from any Land, And holding of our Maine-sheate in my hand, We did espy a cole-blacke Cloud to rise, Fore-runner of some Tempest from the Skies; Scarce had we sayl'd a hundred times our length, But that the winde began to gather strength: Stiffe Eolus with Neptune went to Cuffes: With huffes, and puffes, and angry Counter-Buffes, From boysterous gusts, they fell to fearefull flawes, Whilst we 'twixt wind &amp; water, neer Deaths jaws, Tost like a Corke vpon the mounting maine, Vp with a whiffe, and straightway downe againe, At which we in our mindes much troubled were, And said, God blesse vs all, what weather's here? For (in a word) the Seas so high did grow, That Ships were forc'd to strike their topsails low: Meane time (before the winde) we scudded braue, Much like a Ducke, on top of euery waue. But nothing violent is permanent, And in short space away the Tempest went. So farewell it; and you that Readers be, Suppose it was no welcome Guest to me: My Company and I, it much perplext, And let it come when I send for it next. But leauing jesting, Thankes to God I giue, Twas through his mercy we did scape and liue, And though these things with mirth I doe expresse, Yet still I thinke on God with thankfulnesse. Thus ceast the Storme, and weather gan to smile, And we row'd neere the shoare of Horsey Ile. Then did illustrious Titan gin to steepe His Chariot in the Westerne Ocean deepe: We saw the farre-spent Day, withdraw his light, And made for Harwich, where we lay all night. There did I finde an Hostesse with a Tongue As nimble as it had on Gimmols hung: 'Twill neuer tyre, though it continuall toyl'd, And went as yare, as if it had bin Oyl'd: All's one for that, for ought which I perceiue, It is a fault which all our Mothers haue: And is so firmely grafted in the Sexe, That he's an Asse that seemes thereat to vexe. Apolloes beames began to guild the Hils, And West Southwest the winde the Welkin fils, When I left Harwich, and along we'Row'd Against a smooth calme flood that stifly flow'd, By Bawdsey Hauen, and by Orford Nasse, And so by Aldbrough we at last did passe. By Lestoffe we to Yarmouth made our way, Our third dayes trauell being Saturday, There did I see a Towne well fortifide, Well gouern'd, with all Natures wants supplide; The situation in a wholsome ayre, The buildings (for the most part) sumptuous, faire, The people courteous, and industrious, and With labour makes the Sea inrich the Land. Besides (for ought I know) this one thing more, The Towne can scarcely yeeld a man a Whore: It is renownd for Fishing, farre and neere, And sure in Britaine it hath not a Peere. But noble Nash, thy fame shall liue alwaies, Thy witty Pamphlet, the red It hath not a fellow in England for fishing. A Booke called The praise of the red Herring.Herring praise, Hath done great Yarmouth much renowned right, And put my artlesse Muse to silent quite. On Sunday we a learned Sermon had, Taught to confirme the good, reforme the bad; Acquaintance in the Towne I scarce had any, And sought for none, in feare to finde too many, Much kindnesse to me by mine Host was done, (A Mariner nam'd William Richardson) Besides mine Hostesse gaue to me at last A Cheese, with which at Sea we brake our fast, The gift was round, and had no end indeed, But yet we made an end of it with speed: My thankes surmounts her bounty, all men sees My gratitudes in Print: But where's the Cheese? So on the Munday, betwixt one and twaine, I tooke my leaue, and put to Sea againe, Down Yarmouth Road we'row'd with cutting speed, (The winde all quiet, Armes must doe the deed) Along by Castor, and Sea-bordring Townes, Whose Cliffes &amp; shores abide stern Neptunes frowns, Sometimes a mile from land, and sometimes two, (As depthes or sands permitted vs to doe) Till drawing toward night, we did perceiue The winde at East, and Seas began to heaue: The rowling Billowes all in fury roares And tumbled vs, we scarce could vse our Oares: Thus on a Lee-shore darknesse'gan to come, The Sea grew high, the winds'gan hisse and hum: The foaming curled waues the shore did beate, (As if the Ocean would all Norfolke eate) To keepe at Sea, was dangerous I did thinke, To goe to Land I stood in doubt to sinke: Thus landing, or not landing (I suppos'd) We were in VVe were in a puzzell.perill round about inclos'd; At last to rowe to shore I thought it best, Mongst many euils, thinking that the least: My men all pleas'd to doe as I command, Did turne the Boats head opposite to land, And with the highest waue that I could spie, I bade them rowe to shore immediately. When straight we all leap'd ouer-boord in haste, Some to the knees, and some vp to the waste, Where sodainely 'twixt Owle-light and the darke, We pluck'd the Boat beyond high-water marke. And thus halfe sowsd, halfe stewd, with Sea &amp; sweat, There is no anchor in the text for this note.— And a ship Carpenter. We land at Cromer Towne, halfe dry, halfe wet. But we supposing all was safe and well, In shunning We were like Flounders aliue in a frying-pan, that leap'd into the fire to saue themselues. Sylla, on Caribdis fell: For why, some Women, and some Children there That saw vs land, were all possest with feare: And much amaz'd, ran crying vp and downe, That Enemies were come to take the Towne. Some said that we were Pirats, some said Theeues, And what the women sayes, the men beleeues. With that foure Constables did quickly call, Your ayde! to Armes you men of Cromer all! Then straitway forty men with rusty Bils, Some arm'd in Ale, all of approued skils, Deuided into foure stout Regiments, To guard the Towne from dangerous Euents; Braue Captaine These were the names of the cumbersome Cromorian Constables. Pescod did the Vantguard lead, And Captaine Clarke the Rereward gouerned, Whilst Captaine Wiseman, and hot Captaine Kimble, Were in the mayne Battalia fierce and nimble: One with his squadron watch'd me all the night, Lest from my lodging I should take my flight: A second (like a man of simple note) Did by the Sea side all night watch my Boate, The other two, to make their names Renownd, Did Guard the Town, &amp; brauely walk the Rownd. And thus my Boat, my selfe, and all my men, Were stoutly Guarded, and Regarded then: For they were all so full with feare possest, That without mirth it cannot be exprest. My Inuention doth Curuet, my Muse doth Caper, My Pen doth daunce out lines vpon the Paper, And in a word, I am as full of mirth, As mighty men are at their first sonnes birth. Me thinkes Moriscoes are within my braines, And Heyes, and Antiques run through all my veines: Heigh, to the tune of Trenchmoore I could write The valiant men of Cromers sad affright: As Sheepe doe feare the Wolfe, or Geese the Fox, So all amazed were these sencelesse Blockes: That had the Towne beene fir'd, it is a doubt, But that the women there had pist it out, And from the men Reek'd such a fearefull sent, That People three People did come thither 3. or 4. miles about, to know what the matter was. miles thence mus'd what it ment, And he the truth that narrowly had sifted, Had found the Constables, had need t'haue shifted. They did examine me, I answer'd than I was Iohn Taylor, and a Waterman, And that my honest fellow Iob and I, Were seruants to King Iames his Maiesty, How we to Yorke, vpon a Mart were bound, And that we landed, fearing to be drownd. When all this would not satisfie the Crew, I freely op'd my Trunke, and bade them view, I shew'd them Bookes, of Chronicles and Kings, Some Prose; some Verse, and idle Sonettings, I shew'd them all my Letters to the full: Some to Yorkes Archbishop, and some to Hull, But had the twelue Apostles sure beene there My witnesses, I had beene ne'r the I had as good haue said nothing. neere. And let me vse all Oathes that I could vse, They still were harder of beliefe then Iewes. They wanted faith, and had resolu'd before, Not to beleeue what e'r we said or swore. They said the world was full of much deceit, And that my Letters might be Diligent Officers. counterfeit: Besides, there's one thing bred the more dislike, Because mine Host was knowne a Catholike. These things concurring, people came in Clusters, And multitudes within my lodging Musters, That I was almost woorried vnto death, In danger to be stifled with their breath. And had mine Host tooke pence apiece of those Who came to gaze on me, I doe suppose, No Iack an Apes, Baboone, or Crocodile E'r got more mony in so small a The dancing on the Ropes, or a Puppet play, had come short of his takings, accounting time for time. while. Besides, the Pesants did this one thing more, They call'd and dranke foure shillings on my score: And like vnmanner'd Mungrells went their way, Not spending ought, but leauing me to This was more then I could willingly afford. pay. This was the houshold businesse: in meane space Some Rascals ran vnto my Boate apace, And turn'd and tumbled her, like men of Gotham. Quite topsie turuey vpward with her bottome, Vowing they would in tatters piece-meale teare The cursed Pirates Boate, that bred their feare; And I am sure, their madnesse (to my harme) Tore a Boord out, much longer then mine arme. And they so brus'd, and split our Wherry, that She leak'd, we cast out water with a Hat. Now let men iudge, vpon this truths reuealing, If Turks or Mores could vse more barb'rous dealing; Or whether it be fit I should not write Their enuy, foolish feare, and mad despight.

In all that's writ, I vow I am no lyer, I muse the Beacons were not set on fire. The dreadfull names of Talbot, or of Drake, Ne'r made the foes of England more to quake Then I made Cromer; for their feare and dolor, Each m? might smel out by his neighbors A braue sent. Collor. At last, the ioyfull morning did approach, And Sol began to mount his flaming Coach: Then did I thinke my Purgatory done, And rose betimes intending to be gone; But holla, stay, 'twas otherwayes with me, The messe of Constables were shrunke to three: Sweet M? Pescods double diligence Had horst himselfe, to beare intelligence To Iustices of Peace within the land, What dangerous businesse there was now in hand: There was I forc'd to tarry all the while, Till some said he rode foure and twenty mile, In seeking men of worship, peace and quorum, Most wisely to declare strange newes before vm. And whatsoeuer tales he did recite, I'm sure he caus'd Sir Austin Palgraue, Knight, And M? Robert Kempe a Iustice there Came before me, to know how matters were. As conference 'twixt them and I did passe, They quickly vnderstood me what I was: And though they knew me not in prose and lookes, They had read of me in my verse, and bookes; My businesses account I there did make, And I and all my company did take The lawfull Oath of our Allegeance then, By which we were beleeu'd for honest men. In duty, and in all humility I doe acknowledge the kinde courtesie Of those two Gentlemen; for they did see, How much the people were deceiu'd in me. They gaue me Coyne, and Wine, and Suger too, And did as much as lay in them to doe, To finde them that my Boat had torne and rent, And so to giue them worthy punishment. Besides Sir He would haue had vs to haue staid three or foure dayes with him. Austin Palgraue bade me this, To goe but foure miles, where his Dwelling is, And I and all my Company should there Finde friendly Welcome, mix'd with other Cheare. I gaue them thankes, and so I'l giue them still, And did accept their Cheare in their good will. Then 3. a Clocke at afternoone and past, I was Dischar'd from Cromer at the last. But for men shall not thinke that Enuiously Against this Towne I let my Lines to flye: And that I doe not lie, or scoffe, or fable, For them I wil write something Charitable. It is an Ancient Market Towne that stands Vpon a lofty Cliffe of mouldring Sands: The Sea against the Cliffes doth daily beate, And euery tyde into the Land doth eate, The Towne is poore, vnable by Expence, Against the raging Sea to make defence: And euery day it eateth further in, Still wasting, washing downe the sand doth win, That if some course be not tane speedily, The Town's in danger in the Sea to lye. A goodly Church stands on these brittle grounds, Not many fairer in Great Britaines bounds: And if the Sea shall swallow't, as some feare, Tis not ten thousand pounds the like could reare. No Christian can behold it but with griefe, And with my heart I wish them quicke reliefe. So farewell Cromer, I haue spoke for thee, Though thou didst much vnkindly deale with me, And honest Mariners, I thanke you there, Laboriously you in your armes did beare My Boat for me, three furlongs at the least, When as the tyde of Ebbe was so decreast, You waded, and you launch'd her quite afloate, And on your backes you bore vs to our Boate. Th'vnkindnesse that I had before, it come, Because the Constables were troublesome: Long'd to be busie, would be men of action, Whose labours was their trauels satisfaction: Who all were borne when wit was out of Towne, And therefore got but little of their owne: So farewell Pescod, Wiseman, Kimble, They long'd for imploiment, and rather then be idle, would be ill occupied. Clarke, Foure sonnes of Ignorance (or much more dark) You made me lose a day of braue calme weather. So once againe farewell, fare ill together. Then 'longst the Norfolke Coast we row'd out-right To Blackney, when we saw the comming Night, The burning eye of Day began to winke, And into Thetis lap his beames to shrinke: And as he went, stain'd the departed Skye, With red, blue, purple, and vermillion Dye, Till all our Hemisphere laments his lacke, And mourning night puts on a Robe of blacke, Bespangled diuersly with golden sparkes, Some moueable, some Sea-mens fixed markes. The milky way that blest Astrea went, When as she left this Earthly continent, Shew'd like a Christall cawsey to the Thrones Of Ioue and Saturne, pau'd with precious Stones. Old Oceanus, Neptune, The God of Riuers, Springs, Brookes, Floods, and Fountaines. Innachus, And two and thirty huffe-capt Æolus, Had all tane truce and were in league combin'd, No billowes foaming, or no breath of Winde; The solid Earth, the Ayre, the Ocean deepe Seem'd as the whole world had bin fast asleepe. In such a pleasant Euen as this came I To Blackney, with my Ship and Company: Whereas I found my entertainment good For welcome, drinking, lodging, and for food. The morrow when Latonaes Sunne 'gan rise, And with his Light illumines mortall eyes: When Cocks did crow, &amp; Lambes did bleat &amp; blea, I mounted from my Couch, and put to Sea. Like Glasse the Oceans face was smooth and calme, The gentle Ayre breath'd like Arabian Balme, Gusts, stormes and flawes, lay sleeping in their Cels, Whilst with much labour we Row'd o'r the Welles. This was the greatest We Rowed aboue 100. miles that day. Day of worke indeed. And it behou'd vs much, to make much speed: For why, before that day did quite expire, We past the dangerous Wash, to Lincolnshire. And there in three houres space and little more, We Row'd to Boston from the Norfolke shore: Which by Report of people that dwell there, Is six and twenty mile, or very neere. The way vnknowne, and we no Pilot had, Flats, Sands and shoales; and Tydes all raging mad, Which Sands our passage many times denide, And put vs sometimes Sands lying crookedly in our way, making vs goe three or foure miles about at low water. three or foure miles wide, Besides the Flood runs there, with such great force, That I imagine it out-runnes a Horse: And with a head some 4. foot high that Rores, It on the sodaine swels and beats the Shores. It tumbled vs a ground vpon the Sands, And all that we could doe with wit, or hands, Could not resist it, but we were in doubt, It would haue beaten our Boates bottome out. It hath lesse mercy then Beare, Wolfe, or Tyger, And in those Countries it is call'd the It is so called in Mr. Draytous second part of Polyalbion in his treatise of Humber. Hyger. We much were vnacquainted with those fashions, And much it troubled vs with sundry passions: We thought the shore we neuer should recouer, And look'd still when our Boat would tumble ouer. But He that made all with his word of might, Brought vs to Boston, where we lodg'd all night. The morrow morning when the Sun 'gan peepe, I wak'd and rub'd mine eyes, and shak'd off sleepe, And vnderstanding that the Riuer went, From Boston vp to Lincolne, and to Trent, To Humber, Owse, and Yorke, and (taking paine) We need not come in sight of Sea againe, I lik'd the motion, and made haste away To Lincolne, which was 50. mile, that Day: Which City in the 3. King Edwards Raigne, Was th'onely staple, for this Kingdomes gaine For Leather, Lead, and Wooll, and then was seene Fiue times ten Churches there, but now Fifteene; A braue Cathedrall Church there now doth stand, That scarcely hath a fellow in this Land: Tis for a Godly vse, a goodly Frame, And beares the blessed Virgin Maries name. The Towne is Ancient, and by course of Fate, Through Warres, and Time, defac'd and Ruinate, But Monarchies, &amp; Empires, Kingdomes, Crowns, Haue rose or fell, as Fortune smiles or frownes: And Townes, and Cities haue their portions had Of time-tost Variations, good and bad. There is a Prouerbe, part of which is this, They say that Lincolne was, and London is. From thence we past a Ditch of Weeds and Mud, Which they doe (falsly) there call It is a passage cut thorow the Land eight miles from Lincolne into Trent, but through either the peoples pouerty or negligence, it is growne vp with weedes, and mudde, so that in the Summer it is in many places almost dry. Forcedike Flood: For I'l be sworne, no flood I could finde there, But dirt &amp; filth, which scarce my Boat would beare, 'Tis 8 miles long, and there our paines was such. As all our trauell did not seeme so much, My men did wade and draw the Boate like Horses, And scarce could tugge her on with all our forces: Moyl'd, toyl'd, myr'd, tyr'd, stil labr'ing, euer doing, Yet were we 9. long houres that 8. miles going. At last when as the Day was well-nigh spent, We gat from Forcedikes floodlesse flood to Trent. Eu'n as the Windowes of the Day did shut, Downe Trents swift streame, to Gainsborough we put, There did we rest vntill the morning Starre, The ioyfull doores of Dawning did vn-barre: To Humbers churlish streams, our Course we fram'd, So Nam'd, for Drowning of a King so nam'd. And there the swift Ebbe tide ranne in such sort, The Winde at East, the Waues brake thick &amp; short, That in some doubts, it me began to strike, For in my life, I ne'r had seene the like. My way was vp to Yorke, but my intent Was contrary, for from the fall of Trent I I went fifteene mile out of Trent downe Humber on purpose to see Hull, when my way was quite contrary. fifteene mile went downewards East Northeast, And as my way was vpward West Southwest. And as against the Wind we madly venter, The Waues like Pirats boord our Boate and enter, But though they came in fury, and amaine, Like Theeues we cast them ouer-boord againe. This Conflict lasted two houres to the full, Vntill we gate to Kingston vpon Hull: For to that Towne I had a Prooued friend, That Letters did and Commendations send By me vnto the worthy Magistrate, The Maior, and some of's Brethren, in that State. Besides I had some Letters, of like Charge, From my good Friend, the Master of the Barge, Vnto some friends of his, that they would there Giue me Hull Cheese, is much like a loafe out of a Brewers Basket, it is Composed of two simples, Mault and VVater, in one Compound; and is Cousin Germane to the mightiest Ale in England.

Another I must thanke for his Good will, For he Prest The meaning of those marks are only knowne to the Townsmen there.on to bid me welcome still. There is a Captaine of good Life and Fame, And, God with vs, I oft haue call'd his Name. He welcom'd me, as I had bin his fellow, Lent me his silken Colours, Blacke and Yellow, Which to our Mast made fast, we with a Drum Did keepe, till we to Yorke in Triumph come. Thankes to my louing Host and Hostesse Pease, There at mine Inne, each Night I tooke mine ease: And there I gat a Cantle of Hull Cheese One Euening late, I thanke thee Machabees An ingenuous man named Machabeus.. Kind Roger Parker, many thankes to thee, Thou shew'dst much vndeserued loue to me, Layd my Boat safe, spent time, Coyne and endeauor, And mad'st my mony counted Copper euer: But as at Feasts, the first Course being past, Men doe reserue their Dainties till the last, So my most thankes I euer whil'st I liue, Will to the Maior and his Brethren giue, But most of all, to shut vp all together I giue him thankes that did Commend M? I. I. me thither, Their Loues (like Humber) ouerflow'd the bankes, And though I Ebbe in worth, I'l flow in Thankes. Thus leauing off the Men, now of the Towne Some things which I obseru'd I'l here set downe: And partly to declare it's praise and worth, It is the onely Bulwarke of the North. All other Townes for strength to it may strike, And all the Northerne parts haue not the like. The people from the Sea much Wealth haue wonne, Each man doth liue as he were Neptunes Sonne. Th'Antiquity thereof a man may Reede In Reuerend Cambdens workes, and painfull Speede: How in King Edwards Raigne first of that Name Then called Wike. Then did they Kingston frame, And then the Townesmen cut a The Riuer of Hull is 20. miles in length, cut with mens labour, to the infinite Commodity of the Countrey.Riuer there, An ex'lent Hauen, a Defence or Peere: Built with excessiue Charge, to saue it from Fierce Humbers Raging, that each Tyde doth come. From time to time, more Greatnesse still it gaind, Till lately wh? the Eighth King Henry Raign'd, He made it greater, by his oft Resort, And many times kept there his Royall Court, He Wall'd it well, built Battlements, and Gates, And (more with Honour to augment their States) He built two Blockhouses, and Castle strong, To Guard the Towne from all Inuasiue wrong. He gaue th? much Munition, Swords, Shafts, Bowes, And Brazen Ordnance, as the world well knowes, Which Guns he gaue them for the Towns defence, But were in 88. all borrowed thence, With promise they againe should be sent backe: But the performance euer hath beene slacke. Now in this Yron age, their Guns I see, Are mettle like, the Age, and Yron be: And glad they would be, if they could obtaine, To change that mettle, for their owne againe. Foure well built Gates, with bolts, &amp; lockes, &amp; bars, For ornament or strength, in Peace or Wars: Besides, to keepe their Foes the further out, They can Drowne all the Land three miles about. 'Tis plentifully seru'd with Flesh and Fish, As cheape, as reasonable men can wish. And thus by Gods grace, and mans industry, Dame Nature, or men's Art doth it supply. Some 10. yeeres since Fresh water there was scant, But with much Cost they haue suppli'd that want; By a most ex'lent Water-worke that's made, And to the Towne in Pipes it is conuai'd, Wrought with most Artificiall engines, and Perform'd by th'Art of the Industrious hand Of M? He built another faire water-worke at Yorke, of Free-stone, which doth the City exceeding seruice. William Maultby, Gentleman, So that each man of Note there alwayes can But turne a Cocke within his House, and still They haue Fresh-water alwayes at their will, This haue they all vnto their Great Content, For which, they each doe pay a yeerely Rent. There is a Prouerbe, and a Prayer withall, That we may not to three strange places fall: From Hull, from Hallifax, from Hell, 'tis thus, From all these three, Good Lord deliuer vs. This praying Prouerb's meaning to set downe, Men doe not wish deliuerance from the Towne: The Town's nam'd Kingston, Hul's the furious Riuer: And from Hulls dangers, I say, Lord deliuer. At Hallifax, the Law so sharpe doth deale, That whoso more then 13. Pence doth steale, They haue a Iyn that wondrous quicke and well, Sends Thieues all headlesse vnto Heau'n or Hell. From Hell each man sayes, Lord deliuer me, Because from Hell can no Redemption be: Men may escape from Hull and Hallifax, But sure in Hell there is a heauier taxe, Let each one for themselues in this agree, And pray, From Hell good Lord deliuer me. The Prouerbe and the Prayer expounded plaine, Now to the Orders of the Towne againe: I thinke it merits praise for Gouernment, More then all Townes in Britaines continent, As first their Charity doth much appeare, They for the Poore haue so Marke, for all is true. prouided there, That if a man should walke from Morne till Night, He shall not see one Begger; nor a Mite Or any thing shall be demanded euer, But euery one there doth their best endeauour To make the Idle worke, and to relieue Those that are old and past, or Sicknesse grieue. All poore mens Children haue a House most fit, Whereas they Sowe, &amp; Spin, and Card, and Knit: Where all of them haue something still to doe, As their Capacities will reach vnto, So that no Idle person, Old or Young Within the Towne doth harbour or belong. It yeerely costs Fiue hundred pounds besides, To fence the Towne, from Hull and Humbers tydes, For Stakes, for Bauins, Timber, Stones, and Piles, All which are brought by Water many miles, For Workmens labour, and a world of things, Which on the Towne excessiue charges brings. All which with perill, industry and sweat, They from the bowels of the Ocean get. They haue a Bridewell, and an ex'lent skill, To make some people worke against their will: And there they haue their Lodging and their meat, Cleane Whips, and euery thing exceeding neat: And thus with faire or foule meanes alwayes, they Giue idle Persons little time to play. Besides, for euery Sea or Marine cause They haue a house of Trinity, whose Lawes And Orders doe Confirme, or else Reforme That which is right, or that which wrongs deform. It is a comely built well ordred Place, But that which most of all the House doth grace, Are roomes for Widowes, who are old and poore, And haue bin Wiues to Mariners before. They are for House-roome, food, or lodging, or For firing, Christianly prouided for, And as some dye, some doe their places win, As one goes out, another doth come in. Should I in all things giue the Towne it's due, Some fooles would say I flatter'd, spake vntrue: Or that I partiall in my writings were, Because they made me welcome, and good cheare: But for all those that haue such thoughts of mee, I rather wish that them I hang'd may see, Then that they iustly could report, that I Did Rime for victuals, hunger to supply; Or that my Muse, or working braines should beat, To flatter, fawne, or lye, for drinke or meat: Let Trencher-Poets scrape for such base vailes, I'l take an Oare in hand when writing failes; And 'twixt the Boat and Pen, I make no doubt, But I shall shift to picke a liuing out, Without base flatt'ry, or false coyned words, To mowldy Madams, or vnworthy Lords; Or whatso'er degree, or Townes, or Nations; I euer did, and still will scorne such fashions. Heare-say, I write not by heare-say. sometimes vpon a lye may light, But what I see and know, I dare to write. Mine eyes did view, before my pen set downe, These things that I haue written of this Towne: A new built Custome-house, a faire Towne-Hall, For solemne meetings, or a Festiuall: A Maior, twelue Aldermen, one Shrieue, Recorder, A Towne-Clarke, altogether in one order, And vniformity doe gouerne so, They need not flatter friend, or feare a foe, A Sword, a Cap of maintenance, a Mace Great, and well Guilt, to do the Towne more grace: Are borne before the Maior, and Aldermen, And on Festiuities, or high dayes then, Those Magistrates their Scarlet Gownes doe weare, And haue sixe Sergeants to attend each yeare. Now let men say what Towne in England is, That truly can compare it selfe with this: For Scituation, strength and Gouernment, For Charity, for Plenty, for Content, For state? And one thing more I there was told, Not one Recusant all the Towne doth hold, Nor (as they say) ther's not a Puritan, Or any nose-wise foole Precisian, But great and small, with one consent and will, Obey his Maiesties Iniunctions still. They say that once therein two Sisters dwelt, Which inwardly the pricke of Conscience felt, They came to London, (hauing wherewithall) To buy two Bibles, all Canonicall, Th'Apocrypha did put them in some doubt, And therefore both their bookes were bound without. Except those two, I ne'r did heare of any At Hull, though many places haue too many. But as one scabbed sheepe a flocke may marre, So there's one man, whose nose did stand a jarre: Talk'd very scuruily, and look'd ascue, Because I in a worthy Towns-mans Pue Was plac'd at Church, when (God knowes I ne'r thought, To sit there, I was by the Owner brought. This Squire of low degree displeased than, Said, I at most was but a Water-man, And that they such great kindnesse setting forth, Made more a'th flesh, then e'r the broth was worth: Which I confesse, but yet I answer make, 'Twas more then I with manners could forsake: He sure is some high-minded Pharisee, Or else infected with their heresie, And must be set downe in their Catalogues, They lou'd the highest seats in Synagogues, And so (perhaps) doth he, for ought I know, He may be mounted, when I sit below: But let him not a Water-man despise, For from the water he himselfe did rise, And windes and water both on him haue smil'd, Else, The great Marchant he had ne'r bin stil'd: His Character I finely will contriue, He's scornefull proud, and talking talkatiue: A great Ingrosser of strange speech and newes, And one that would sit in the highest Pues, But bate an Ace, he'l hardly winne the game, And if I list, I could rake But I was euer better with forks to scatter, then with Rakes to gather, therefore I would not haue the Townes men to mistake chalke for Cheese, or Robert for Richard. out his name. Thanks M?. Maior, for my Bacon Gammon, Thankes Roger Parker, for my small fresh Sammon, 'Twas ex'lent good, and more the truth to tell ye, Boyl'd with a fine Plum-Pudding in the belly. The sixth of August, well accompani'd With best of Townes-men to the waters side, There did I take my leaue, and to my Ship I with my Drum and Colors quickly skip: The one did dub a dub and rumble, braue The Ensigne in the aire did play and waue: I launc'd, supposing all things had bin done, Bownce, from the Block-house, quoth a roaring Gun. And wauing Hats on both sides with content I cri'd Adiew, adiew, and thence we went Vp Humbers flood that then amaine did swell, Windes calme, and water quiet as a Well: We Row'd to Owse with all our force and might, To Cawood, where we well were lodg'd all night. The morrow, when as Phœbus 'gan to smile, I forwards set to Yorke eight little mile: But two miles short of Yorke I landed than, To see that reuerend At Bishopsthorpe, where the right reuerend Father in God, Toby Mathew Archbishop of Yorke his Grace did make me welcome. Metropolitan, That watchful Shepheard, that with care doth keep Th'infernall Wolfe, from Heau'ns supernall Sheepe: The painefull Preacher, that most free Almes-giuer, That though he liue long, is too short a liuer: That man, whose age the poore doe all lament, All knowing, when his Pilgrimage is spent, When Earth to Earth returnes, as Natures debter, They feare the Prouerbe, Seldome comes the better. His Doctrine and example speake his due, And what all people sayes, must needs be true. In duty I most humbly thanke his Grace, He at his Table made me haue a place, And meat and drinke, and gold he gaue me there, Whilst al my Crue i'th Hal were fill'd with cheare: So hauing din'd, from thence we quickly past, Through Owse strong Bridge, to York faire City last; Our drowning scap'd, more danger was ensuing, 'Twas Size time there, and hanging was a brewing; But had our faults beene ne'r so Capitall, We at the Vintners Barre durst answer all. Then to the good Lord Maior I went, and told What labour, and what dangers manifold, My fellow and my selfe had past at Seas. And if it might his noble Lordship please, The Boat that did from London thither swim With vs, in duty we would giue to him. His Lordship pawsing, with a reuerend hum, My friend (quoth he) to morrow morning come: In the meane space I'l of the matter thinke, And so he bade me to goe nee'r and drinke. I dranke a Cup of Claret and some Beere, And sure (for ought I know) he There is some oddes betweene keeping and spending. keeps good cheere. I gaue his Lordship in red guilded leather, A well bound booke of all my Workes together, Which he did take Heere I make a full point, for I receiued not a point in exchange.. There in the City were some men of note, That gladly would giue money for our Boat: But all this while good manners bade vs stay, To haue my good Lord Maiors yea, or nay. But after long demurring of the matter I thought it my duty (being we had come a dangerous voyage) to offer our Boat to the chiefe Magistrate: For why should not my Boat be as good a monument, as Tom Coriats euerlasting ouertrampling land-conquering Shooes thought I?, He well was pleas'd to see her on the water, And then my men Row'd halfe an houre or more, Whilst he stood viewing her vpon the shore. They bore his Lordships Children in her there, And many others, as she well could beare. At which his Honour was exceeding merry, Saying it was a pretty nimble Wherry: But when my men had taken all this paines, Into their eyes they might haue put their gaines. Vnto his shop he did And forgat to say, I thanke you good fellowes. perambulate, And there amongst his Barres of Iron sate. I ask'd him if he would our Boat forgoe, Or haue her? And his Lordship answer'd, No. I tooke him at his word, and said, God buy, And gladly with my Boat away went I. I sold the Boat, as I suppos'd most meet, To honest A substantiall worthy Citizen, who hath beene Shrieue of York, and now keepes the George in Cunny street. M?. Kayes in Cunny street: He entertain'd me well, for which I thanke him, And gratefully amongst my friends I'l ranke him. My kind remembrance here I put in paper, To worthy M?. Hemsworth there a Draper. Amongst the rest he's one that I must thanke, With his good wife, and honest brother Franke. Now for the City: 'Tis of state and Port, Where Emperors &amp; Kings haue kept their Court, 989, yeere the foundation Was layd, before our Sauiours Incarnation, By Ebrank was the fift K. of Britain after Brute. Ebrank who a Temple there did reare, And plac'd a An Arch-Flammin, which was as an Idolatrous high Priest to Diana. Flammin to Diana there: But when King Lucius here the Scepter swaid, The Idols leuell with the ground were layd, Then Eleutherius, Romes high Bishop plac'd, An Archbishop at Yorke, with Titles grac'd, Then after Christ 627. Was Edwin Edwin and his whole family were baptized on Easter day the 12. of Aprill 6 7. baptiz'd by the grace of heauen, He pluck'd the Minster down, that then was wood, And made it stone, a deed both great and good. The City oft hath knowne the chance of warres, Of cruell forraigne, and of home-bred iarres. And those that further please thereof to read, May turne the volumes of great Hollinshead, 'Tis large, 'tis pleasant and magnificent, The Norths most fertile famous ornament: 'Tis rich and populous, and hath indeed No want of any thing to serue their need, Abundance doth that noble City make Much abler to bestow, then need to take. So farewell Yorke, Yorkeshire the greatest shire in England, and 308. miles about Speed. the tenth of August then Away came I for London with my men. To dinner I to Pomfret Pomfret Castle. quickly rode, Where good hot Venison staid for my abode, I thanke the worshipfull George Shillito, He fill'd my men and me, and let vs goe. There did I well view ouer twice or thrice, A strong, a faire, and ancient Edifice: Reedifi'd, where it was ruin'd most, At th'high and hopefull Prince Prince Charles. of Wales his cost. I saw the roome where Exton Sir Pierce of Exton Knight. King Richard the second murdered there. and his rowt Of Traytors, Royall Richards braines beat out: And if that King did strike so many blowes, As hackes and hewes vpon one pillar showes, There are one hundred slashes, he withstood, Before the Villaines shed his Kingly blood. From Pomfret then, vnto my noble friend, Sir Robert Swift at Doncaster we wend, An ancient Knight, of a most generous spirit, Who made me welcome farre beyond my merit. From thence by Newarke, I to Stamford past, And so in time to London at the last, With friends and neighbors, all with louing hearts, Did welcome me with pottles, pintes and quarts. Which made my Muse more glib, and blythe to tell This story of my Voyage. So farewell. An Epilogue. Thus haue I brought to end a worke of paine, I wish it may requite me with some gaine: For well I wote, the dangers where I ventered, No full bag'd man would euer durst haue entered: But hauing further shores for to discouer Hereafter, now my Pen doth here giue ouer.

In all Ages and Countries, it hath euer bin knowne, that Famous men haue florished, whose worthy Actions, and Eminency of place, haue euer beene as conspicuous Beacons Burning and blazing to the Spectators view: the sparkes and flames whereof hath sometimes kindled Courage in the most coldest and Effeminate Cowards; as Thersites amongst the Grecians, Amadis de Gaule, &amp; Sir Huon of Burdeaux in France: Sir Beuis, Gogmag og, Chinon, Palmerin, Lancelot, and Sir Tristram amongst vs here in England: Sir Degre, Sir Grime, and Sir Gray Steele in Scotland; Don Quixot with the Spaniards, Gargantua almost no where, Sir Dagonet and Sir Triamore any where: all these, and many more of the like Ranke haue fill'd whole Volumes, with the ayrie Imaginations of their vnknowne and vnmatchable worths: So Ireland amongst the rest, had the Honor to produce and breed a sparke of Valour, Wisedome, and Magnanimity, to whom all the Nations of the world must giue place. The Great O Toole, is the toole that my Muse takes in hand, whose praises (if they should be set forth to the full) would make Apollo and the Muses Barren; To whom the nine Worthies were neuer to be compared: betwixt whom, and Haniball, Scipio, the Great Pompey, or Tamberlaine, was such oddes, that it was vnfit the best of them should hold his stirrop, and who (by his owne Report) in whom Ireland may reioyce, and England be merry, whose Youth was Dedicated to Mars, and his Age to Westminster, which ancient Cittie, is now honour'd with his beloued Residence.Prologue. Braue Vsquebough that fierce Hibernian liquor, Assist my braine, and make my wit run quicker: To heat my Muse like to a well warm'd Chimney, I beg thy merry ayde kinde Polyhimny. I list not to call Fables into question, Nor of Baboones, or idle bables jest I on: And yet if Sence or reason heere you looke for, For neither, or for either read this Booke for, And if perchance I doe in any word lye, Doe, as I writ it, reade it o'r absurdly: Though in these daies there are a Crew of fond men, That for inuention striue to goe beyond men, And write so humerous Dogmaticall, To please my Lord and Lady what d'ee Call, With Inkehorne tearms stiffe quilted &amp; bumbasted, And (though not vnderstood) yet are well tasted. And therefore I'l not reach beyond the bounds of My weake capacity, nor search the sounds of Deepe Natures secrets, or Arts spacious cirquit: My Muse is free from those, my selfe will her quit. But leauing idle toyes, with toyle endure I on, To write the praise of this braue bold Centurion. Thou Famous man, East, West, and North, and Southward, From Boreas cold rump, t' Austers flauering mouthward, I call Apolloes daughters all, to witnes, Much would I praise thee, but my Wit wants fitnes. But thou thy selfe (of thy selfe) canst speake so-well, That though my Rimes not altogether goe-well, Yet if the worlds applause would not att?d thee Were al tongus mute, thy own tongue wold c?mend thee Thy selfe (vnto thy selfe) art Fames Trump blasting, To make thy name (like Buffe) tough, long &amp; lasting. (Yet gr?t me, thou braue man, that ne'r feard colors) T'accept the poore Lines of an Artlesse Scullers: Thy Bilboe oft bath'd in the blood of Foe mans, Like Caius Marius, Consull of the Romans: When thou hast seem'd more dreadfull in thy harnesse, Then Babels Generall great Holophernes: More in command then was Nabuchadnezzar, And more renownd then Cayus Iulius Cæsar: Vpon thy foes brest thou hast often troad free, As on the Pagans did braue Boloignes Godfrey. Fierce Methridates the stout King of Pontus, If thou dost lead vs, dares not to confront vs: Thy matchlesse valour ten to one more tride is, Then euer was the Libian strong Alcides: And all men know that neuer such an od piece Of fighting mettle, sprung from Mars his Codpiece. Vpon the maine land and the raging Ocean, Thy courage hath attaind thee high promotion: Thou neuer fear'dst to combate with Garganto, Thy fam's beyond the battaile of Lepanto: The mighty Alexander of Macedo, Ne'r fought as thou hast done with thy Toledo. We hold thee for a worthy, and no base one, But one that could haue won the fleece from Iason: Thou durst oppose 'gainst Bore, Beare, Wolfe or Lion, And from the torturing wheele to fetch Ixion: And I acknowledge that thy matchlesse vallour is, To kill Pasiphaes or the Bull of Phalleris: Though age hath ouertaine thee, yet thy will is, To grapple with an Aiax or Achilles, Or with Hells Monarch enuious ill fac'd Pluto, And proue him by his hornes a dambd Cornuto. Thou fearst no Diuell, nor no Demogorgon, Nor yet the valiant Welchman Shon a Morgan: So that most Wizards, and most fortune tellers, Approue thee for the greatst of Monster quellers: And absolute and potent Dominator, For War or Counsell both by land and Water: In times of tumult thou amongst the Irish, Hast made them skip o'r bogs and quagmires mirish, Whilst in the pursuit, like an angry Dragon, Thou mad'st them runne away with not a rag on. For had thy foes bin Thousands, with thy Pistall, And thy good sword, thou brauely, wouldst resist all. Thou wast to vs, as vnto Rome was Titus, And stoutly sent our foes to blacke Cocitus. To kill, and cut throats, thou art skild in that trick, As if thou wert the Champion to Saint Patricke: I know not to which worthy to compare thee, For were they liuing, they could not out-dare thee. To thee what was great Tamberlaine the Tartar, Or matcht with thee what was our Britain Arthur? Great Haniball, that famous Carthaginian, Was not a mate for thee in mine opinion; And all Seuerus vertues sum'd vp totall, Remaine in thee, if this blind Age would note all: Thou shewdst thy selfe a doughty wight at Dublin, When Irish Rebells madly brought the trouble in: At Baltimore, Kinsale, at Corke, and Yoghall, Thou with thy power hast made them oft cry fogh all: Oft in thy rage, thou hast most madly ran on, The burning mouth of the combustious Cannon. For in thy fury, thou hast oft beene hotter, More swifter then an Ambler, or a Trotter, As witnesse can the bounds of fierce Tirconnel, And the rough Bickerings with the stout Odonnell. The slaues did scud before thee o'r the Quagmires: Where many a warlike Horse, &amp; many a Nagmires: Thou kildst the gammon visag'd poore Westphalians, The Al-to-totterd, torne Tatterdemalians: The broaging, roaging, brawling, base Bazonians: The swift-foot, light-heeld, run-away Slauonians, Thou letst th? haue no ground to stand or walke on, But made them flye as Doues doe from a Falcon. For if thou list in fight to lead a Band on, Thy slaughtering sword, if thou but layst thy hand on, Thy fearefull foes would strait the place abandon, Without or hose, or shooes, shirt, or a band on: Thou letst them haue no quiet place to stand on. By tongue or pen it cannot well be verifide, How many hundred thousands thou hast terrifide, For thou hast rac'd more Castles, forts &amp; Garrisons, Beyond Arithmeticke, and past comparisons: The Prouerbe sayes, Comparisons are odious, I'l therefore leaue them being incommodious. In all thy actions thou hast beene impartiall, Accommodating thy designes as Martiall, In mortall battels and in bruising battery, Thy eares would entertain no smooth-tongu'd flattery. That though to all men thy exploits seem'd very od, Thou brought'st them still to an auspitious Period, And as thy valour durst out-dare bold Hector, Like wise Vlisses thou canst speake a Lector: Such policies thy wits mint could deuise on, Which wiser pates could neuer once surmise on: With many a hundred neuer heard of Stratagem, Thou hast got precious honour, is not that a Iem? What trickes, or slights of war so ere the foe meant, Thou canst descry and frustrate in a moment. Upon his Wisedome, and Policie. Of thy Heroick acts, there might be more said, For sure they are but slightly toucht aforesaid, But Gods or Muses, Men, or Fiends infernall, To blaze thee to thy worth, can ne'r discerne all: And should I write but halfe that I know of thee, Some Criticks would perswade thee I did scoffe thee. Thus hauing shewd thy valor, now I'l expound Part of thy policies, and wisedome profound. Vnfellowed, and vnfollowed, and vnmatched, Are the rare slights that in thy pate were hatched: Of Engines, Mines, of Counterscarphs and Trenches, And to keep clear the Camp from whoring w?ches: To teach the Soldiers eat frogs, snailes and vermine. Such Stratagems as these thou couldst determine. That Cato, Plato, or Aurelius Marcus, Wise Socrates, or reuerend Aristarchus, Diogenes, or wise Pithagoras, Licurgus, Pliny, Anaxagoras, Archidamus of Greece, or Romane Tully, Could ne'r demonstrate Sapience more fully; And specially when there was any trouble like, To vexe, molest, or trouble the Republike: That wit with valour, valour ioynd with wisdome, From all the world thou hast attained this doome: To be wars Abstract, Counsels Catechizer, That canst direct all, and all scarce the wiser. A Complaint and a Petition to him. Thus thou of Yore hast followed great Belona, And shin'd in Arms like twins of bright Latona: But now those manly martiall dayes are gone. A Time of Cheating, swearing, drinking drabbing, Of burst-gut feeding and inhumane stabbing, The Spanish Pip, or else the Gallian Morbus, Bone-bred diseases, mainely doe disturbe vs: That now more men by ryot are confounded, Then valiant Souldiers in the wars were wounded. Mars yeelds to Venus, Gown-men rule the rost now, And men of War may fait, or kisse the post now. The thundring Cannon &amp; the rumbling Drum now, The Instruments of War are mute and dumbe now, And stout experienc't valiant Commanders, Are turn'd Saint Nicholas Clarks, &amp; high-way standers. And some (through want) are turn'd base Pimps and Panders, The watchfull Corporall, and the Lansprezado Are Marchants turn'd, of smoaky Trinidado. His shop, (a fadome compasse) now containes him, Where midst the misty vapours he complaines him, That he who hath made Forts and Castles caper, Liues now Camelion-like, by Ayre &amp; Vaper. Whilst fools &amp; flatterers thriue, it greatly grieues him, When all Trades fayle, Tobacco last relieues him, Besides each day some hound-like senting Sergeant Scoutes, gapes, pries, preyes, and tires him out for argeant: And Longlane Dogditch, dambd soule wanting Brokers The Cómon wealths bane &amp; poore mens vnclokers, The Countries Spunges, and the Cities soakers, The Peaces Pestilence, and Warriours choakers. These beate their hogs-heads all, to try conclusions, By base extorting, working our confusions. The Souldier's naked, by the broakers bribing, The Scriuener liues braue by sophisticke scribing, The slaues grow rich (and 'tis not to be wondred) By taking Forty intrest for a hundred. And nasty beadles with their breath contaminous, With What are you? &amp; Who goes there? examinvs: With hums &amp; hawes, Sir reuerence, nods &amp; becking, With sensles nonsence, checks &amp; Counter checking: The brownbild Rug-gound b?ch do think it fitting, To exercise their Office by committing. Where our expence, with Ale their faces varnish, Whilst we incounterd, pay fines, fees and garnish. And Tyburne, Wapping, and S. Thomas Watrings, Poor Soldiers ends, to euery neighboring State rings, Whilest lowzy Ballad-mongers gape and look out, To set some riming song, or Roguing Booke out. Where more then all is 'gainst the dead imputed, By which meanes men are doubly executed; That sure the Gallowes hath eat vp more pe??ople, Then would subdue and win Constantinople. O rouze thee, rouze thee, then braue man of Action, Make Fur-gown'd peace burst into Armed faction: Thou hast a pate that canst the State vnsettle: Be as thou hast beene then, a Man of mettle: And now base Cowardize doth seeme to rust vs, Into some worthy busines, quickly thrust vs, Now shew thy selfe a noble Ahashucrus, And once more make our brauing foes to feare vs, Doe thou but lead vs on, and looke but grimly, And make no doubt, we'l doe the busines trimly. Mongst all the tooles of war, be thou great O Toole, And neuer let the world esteeme thee no Foole. O make the wheele of reeling State, and Fate turne, In spight of sullen melancholly Saturne, To Armes, but from the Armes of lustfull Uenus I doe intreat thy warlike care to weane vs. Let not the prick-eard power of proud Priapus, In bonds of painted Curtezans intrap vs, And rouze vs from our Acts &amp; thoughts libidinous, That (Traytor-like) in ambush doe lye hid in vs. Let not thy Tents of worthles Martiall discipline, Be turn'd to stinking Tap-houses to tipple in: But make the freezing pot of num-cold war-boyle, And bubble to a hurly burly Garboyle: Doe as thou hast done oft, most noble Spartan, Strike silken peace into a feauer Quartane; Or else like Phœbus in his hot Meridian, Astonish all the world with a Quotidian, I know thy worth the world doth all admire on, Then clad thy selfe in burnisht steele and Yron. I know that all men knows thou hast bin tri'd well, Discreetly thou canst talke, fight, run and ride well, I know, the reach of thy politike skull can Plucke rugged Mars from out the bed of Uulcan, To make warre roare more loud then any Bull can, I know thou canst doe more then any Gull can. I know thou hold'st it Valours ignominy. To spend thy dayes in peacefull whip her Ginny. Thy name &amp; voice, more fear'd then Guy of Warwick, Or the rough rumbling, roaring Meg of Barwicke. We should do somewhat, if we once were rouzed, And (being Lowsie) we might then be Lowsed. Encourage Souldiers to demeane them like men, And measure Veluet with their Pikes braue Pikem?. Let shouts &amp; clamors, woods, groues, dales, &amp; hils fil With dredful noise &amp; cries of follow, follow, kil, kil, Let Drums cry dub, dub, and let Cannons thunder, Tantara Trumpets, and let Cowards wonder: Let Musquets bounce, bounce, let the Welkin rumble, Let Townes, Turrets, topsituruy tumble, Doe this (as well I know thou canst doo't wisely) Exceeding carelesse, fearelesse and precisely. And then thy Fame shall farther farre be noysed, Then Titans rayes, or Iustice scales are poysed. And since thou knowest mans time on earth is short all, Let mortall Actions make thy name Immortall. Lenuoy. Ivdge O you Gentiles, what is writ is probable, And though it seeme a bable, yet 'tis no bable. Doome amongst ill things, that the best is ment all, And what's amisse, pray take as accidentall: For like a puny practizing Astronomy, And knows no grounds nor rules, so far o'rgon am I, In diuing to his valours whirlepit bottome, That like the reuerend Sages of old Gotam, I now perceiue how much I ouershot am: I'l wade no further in't, but in briefe breuity, Abrupt, absurd, abiect, thus cast, thus leaue it I. These forc'd Rimes, fully stuft with fruitlesse labor, Hath Curried my poore braine-pan like a Tabor: And to recure me from this strange quandary, Hence Usquebaugh, and welcome sweet Canary. FJNJS. A DISCOVERY BY SEA, FROM London TO Salisbvry. TO THE NOBILITY, GENTRY, AND COMMVNALTY, WHO ARE INHABITANTS, OR WEL-WILLERS TO THE WELFARE OF THE CITIE OF Salisbvry, AND COVNTY OF Wiltshire. [As our accounts in Almanacks agree] As our accounts in Almanacks agree, The yeere cal'd sixteen hundred twenty three: That Iulyes twenty eight, two houres past dinner, We with our Wherry, and fiue men within her, Along the christall Thames did cut and curry, Betwixt the Counties, Middlesex and Surry: Whilst thous?ds gaz'd, we past the bridge with w?der, Where fooles &amp; wise men goe aboue &amp; vnder. We thus our Voyage brauely did begin Downe by S. Katherines, where the Priest fell in, By Wapping, where as hang'd drownd Pirats dye; (Or else such Any Rat that eates Pye, is a Pyrat. Rats, I thinke as would eate Pie.) And passing further, I at first obseru'd, That When I past downe the Riuer, there was not any Post or Horne there, but since it is most worthily Repaired. Cuckolds-Hauen was but badly seru'd: For there old Time had such confusion wrought, That of that Ancient place remained nought. No monumentall memorable Horne, Or Tree or Post, which hath those Trophees borne, Was left, whereby Posterity may know Where their forefathers Crests did grow, or show. Which put into a maze my muzing Muse, Both at the worlds neglect, and times abuse, That that stout Pillar, to Obliuions pit Should fall, whereon Plus vltra might be writ, That such a marke of Reuerend note should lye Forgot, and hid, in blacke obscurity, Especially when men of euery sort Of countries, Cities, warlike Campes or Court, Vnto that Tree are plaintiffs or defendants, Whose All estates or degrees doe elther loue or feare this Hauen. loues, or feares, are fellowes or attendants: Of all estates, this Hauen hath some partakers By lot, some Cuckolds, and some Cuckold-makers. And can they all so much forgetfull be Vnto that Ancient, and Renowned Tree, That hath so many ages stood Erected, And by such store of Patrons beene protected, And now Ingloriously to lye vnseene, As if it were not, or had neuer beene? Is Lechery wax'd scarce, is Bawdry scant, Is there of Whores, or Cuckolds any want? Are Whore-masters decai'd, are all Bawds dead? Are Panders, Pimps, and Apple-squires, all fled? No surely, for the Surgeons can declare That Venus warres, more hot then Marses are. Why then, for shame this worthy Port mainetaine, Let's haue our Tree, and Hornes set vp againe: That Passengers may shew obedience to it, In putting off their Hats, and homage doe it. Let not the Cornucopiaes of our land, Vnsightly and vnseene neglected stand: I know it were in vaine for me to call, That you should rayse some famous Hospitall, Some Free-schoole, or some Almshouse for the pore, That might increase good deeds, &amp; ope heau'ns dore. 'Tis no taxation great, or no collection Which I doe speake of, for This great erection: For if it were, mens goodnesses, I know, Would proue exceeding barren, dull, and slow: A Post and Hornes, will build it firme and stable, Which charge to beare, there's many a begger able; The place is Ancient of Respect most famous, The want of due regard to it, doth shame vs, For Cuckolds Hauen, my request is still, And so I leaue the Reader to his will. But holla Muse, no longer be offended, 'Tis worthily Repair'd, and brauely mended, For which great meritorious worke, my pen Shall giue the glory vnto Greenwitch men. It was their onely cost, they were the Actors Without the helpe of other Benefactors, For which my pen their prayses here adornes, As they haue beautifi'd the Hau'n with Hornes. From thence to Debtford we amaine were driuen, Whereas an Anker vnto me was giuen: With parting pintes, and quarts for our farewell; We tooke our Ieaues, and so to Greenwitch fell. There shaking hands, adiews, and drinkings store, We tooke our Ship againe, and left the shore. Then downe to Erith, 'gainst the tyde we went, Next London, greatest Maior towne in Kent Or Christendome, and I approue it can, That there the Maior was a Waterman, Who gouernes, rules, and reignes sufficiently, And was the Image of Authority: With him we had cheap Reck'nings &amp; good cheere. And nothing but his friendship we thought deere. But thence we rows'd our selues and cast off sleepe, Before the day-light did begin to peepe. The tyde by Grauesend swiftly did vs bring, Before the mounting-Larke began to sing, And e'r we came to Lee, with speedy pace The Sun 'gan rise with most suspicious face, Of foule foreboding weather, purple, red, His Radient Tincture, East, Northeast o'rspred: And as our Oares thus downe the Riuer pull'd, Oft with a Fowling-peece the Gulls we gull'd, For why, His name is Arthur Bray a Waterman of Lambeth, and a good Markman. the Master Gunner of our Ship Let no occasion or aduantage slip, But charg'd and discharg'd, shot, and shot againe, And scarce in twenty times shot once in vaine. Foule was the weather, yet thus much I'l say, If't had beene faire, Fowle was our food that day. Thus downe alongst the spacious Coast of Kent By Grane and Sheppeies Ilands downe we went, We past the Nowre-head, and the sandy shore, Vntill we came to th'East end of the Nowre, At last by Ramsgates Peere we stiffly Rowed, The winde and tyde, against vs blow'd and flowed, Till neere vnto the Hauen where Sandwitch stands, We were enclosed with most dangerous sands. There were we sowsd &amp; slabberd, wash'd &amp; dash'd, And grauell'd that it made vs We were fiue men, and two of vs were afraid, two were not afraid, and I was halfe afraid. halfe abash'd: We look'd and pry'd, and stared round about, From our apparant perils to get out. For with a Staffe, as we the depth did sound, Foure miles from land, we almost were on ground. At last (vnlook'd for) on our Larboord side A thing turmoyling in the Sea we spide, Like to a Meareman; wading as he did All in the Sea his neather parts were hid, Whose Brawney limbs, and rough neglected Beard, And grim aspect, made halfe of vs afeard, And as he vnto vs his course did make, I courage tooke, and thus to him I spake. Man, monster, fiend or fish, what-e'r thou be, That trauelst here in Neptunes Monarchy, I charge thee by his dreadfull Three-tin'd Mace, Thou hurt not me or mine, in any case, And if thou bee'st produc'd of Mortall kinde, Shew vs some course, how we the way may finde To deeper water, from these sands so shallow, In which thou seest our Ship thus wash and wallow. With that (he shrugging vp his shoulders strong) Spake (like a Christian) in the Kentish tongue, Quoth he, Kinde sir, I am a Fisherman, Who many yeeres my liuing thus hauewan By wading in these sandy troublous waters For Shrimps, Wilks, Cockles, and such vsefull matters, And I will lead you, (with a course I'l keepe) From out these dangerous shallowes to the deepe. Then (by the nose) along he led our Boate, Till (past the fiats) our Barke did brauely floate. Our Sea-horse, that had drawne vs thus at large, I gaue two groats vnto, and did discharge. Then in an houre and halfe, or little more, We throgh the-Downes at Deale went safe on shore. There did our Hostesse dresse the Fowle we kill'd, With which our hungry stomacks well we fill'd, The morrow being Wednesday (breake of day) We towards Douer tooke our weary way: The churlish windes awak'd the Seas high fury, Which made vs glad to land there, I assure yee. Blinde Fortune did so happily contriue, That we (as sound as bells) did safe ariue At Douer, where a man did ready stand, To giue me Entertainment by the hand, A man of mettle, marke and note, long since He graced was to lodge a gracious Prince, And now his speeches sum, and scope and pith Is Iack and Tom, each one his Cousin Smith, That if with pleasant talke you please to warme ye, He is an Host much better then an Army, A goodly man, well fed, and corpulent, Fill'd like a bag-pudding with good content, A right good fellow, free of cap and legge, Of complement, as full as any Egge: To speake of Him, I know it is of Folly, He is a mortall foe to Melancholy. Mirth is his life and trade, and I thinke very, That he was got when all the world was merry: Health vpon health, he doubled and redoubled, Till his and mine, and all our braines were troubled, Vnto our absent Betters there we dranke; Whom we are bound to loue, they not to thanke: By vs mine Host could no great profit reape, Our meat and lodging was so good and cheape, That to his praise thus much I'l truly tell, He vs'd vs kindly euery way and well. And though my lines before are merry writ, Where-e'r I meet him, I'l acknowledge it. To see the Castle there I did desire, And vp the Hill I softly did aspire, Whereas it stands, impregnable in strength, Large in Circumference, height, bredth, and length, Built on a fertile plat of ground, that they Haue yeerely growing twenty loads of Hay, Great Ordnance store, pasture for Kine and Horses, Rampires and Walls, t'withstand inuasiue forces, That it be well with truth and courage man'd, Munition, victuall'd, then it can withstand The powers of twenty Tamberlaines (the Great) Till in the end with shame they would Retreat. Tis gouern'd by a graue and prudent The right Honourable the Lord Zouch, Lord Warden of the Cinque ports. Lord, Whose Iustice doth to each their right afford, Whose worth (within the Castle, and without) The fiue Ports, and the country all about, The people with much loue, doe still recite, Because he makes the wrongers render Right. The kindnesse I receiued there was such, That my remembrance cannot be too much. I saw a Gun thrice eight foot length of Brasse, And in a Wheele I saw a comely Asse (Dance like a Dog) that's turning of a Spit, And draw as it were from the infernall pit, (Whose deepe-Abisse is perpendicular) One hundred fathome (or well neere as farre) So christaline, so cleere, and coole a water, That will in Summer make a mans teeth chatter: And when to see it vp, I there had stood, I dranke thereof, and found it sweet and good. So farewell Castle, Douer, Douer Peere, Farewell, Oast Bradshaw, thanks for my good cheer. My bonny Barke to Sea was bound againe; On Thursday morne, we lanch'd into the Maine, By Folstone, and by Sangates ancient Castle, Against the rugged waues, we tugge and wrastle By Hyde, by Rumney, and by Rumney Marsh. The Tyde against vs, and the winde blew harsh, 'Twixt Eolus and Neptune was such strife, That I ne'r felt worse weather in my life: Tost and retost, retost and tost againe; With rumbling, tumbling, on the rowling Maine, The boystrous breaking Billowes curled locks Impetuously did beate against the Rockes, The winde much like a Horse whose wind is broke, Blew thicke and short, that we were like to choake: As it outragiously the billowes shaues, The Gusts (like dust) blown from the bryny waues, And thus the winds and seas robustious gods Fell by the eares starke mad at furious ods. Our slender Ship, turmoyld 'twixt shores and Seas, Aloft or low, as stormes and flawes did please: Sometimes vpon a foaming Mountaines top, Whose height did seeme the heau'ns to vnderprop, When straight to such profundity she fell, As if she diu'd into the deepest Hell, The Clowds like ripe Apostumes burst &amp; showr'd, Their mattery watery substance headlong powr'd; Yet though all things were mutable and fickle, They all agreed to souse vs in a pickle, Of waters fresh and salt, from Seas and Skye, Which with our sweat ioynd in triplicity, That looking each on other, there we saw, We neither were halfe stewd, nor yet halfe raw, But neither hot or cold, good flesh or fishes For Caniballs, we had beene ex'lent dishes. Bright Phœbus hid his golden head with feare, Not daring to behold the dangers there, Whilst in that straight or Exigent we stand, We see and wish to land, yet durst not land, Like rowling Hills the Billowes beate and roare Against the melancholly Beachie shore, That if we landed, neither strength or wit Could saue our Boate from being sunke or split. To keepe the Sea, sterne puffing Eols breath Did threaten still to blow vs all to death, The waues amaine (vnbid) oft boorded vs, Whilst we almost three houres beleaguerd thus, On euery side with danger and distresse, Resolu'd to run on shore at Dengie Nesse. There stand some thirteene Cottages together, To shelter Fishermen from winde and weather, And there some people were as I suppos'd, Although the dores and windowes all were clos'd: I neere the land, into the Sea soone leapt To see what people those same houses kept, I knock'd and cal'd, at each, from house to house, But found no forme of mankinde, Man or No dwelling within neere three miles of those Cottages. Mouse. This newes all sad, and comfortlesse and cold, Vnto my company I straightwayes told, Assuring them the best way I did thinke, Was to hale vp the Boate, although she sinke. Resolued thus, we all together please To put her head to shore, her sterne to Seas, They leaping ouerboord amidst the Billowes, We pluck'd her vp (vnsunke) like stout tall fellows. Thus being wet, from top to toe we strip'd, (Except our shirts) and vp and downe we skip'd, Till winde and Sunne our wants did well supply, And made our outsides, and our insides dry. Two miles fr? thence, a ragged The townes name is Lydd, two miles from Rumney in Kent. town there stood, To which I went to buy some drinke and food: Where kindely ouer-reckon'd, well misus'd Was, and with much courtesie abus'd. Mine Oastesse did account it for no trouble, For single fare to make my payment double: Yet did her mind and mine agree together, That (I once gone) would neuer more come thither: The Cabbins where our Boat lay safe and well, Belong'd to men which in this towne did dwell: And one of them (I thanke him) lent vs then The Key to ope his hospitable Den, A brazen Kettle, and a pewter dish, To serue our needs, and dresse our flesh and fish: Then from the Butchers we bought Lamb &amp; sheep, Beere from the Alehouse, and a Broome to sweepe Our Cottage, that for want of vse was musty, And most extremely rusty-fusty-dusty. There, two dayes space, we Roast, &amp; boile, &amp; broile, And toyle, and moyle, and keepe a noble coyle, For onely we kept open house alone, And he that wanted Beefe, might haue a Stone. Our Grandam Earth (with beds) did al befriend vs, And bountifully all our lengths did lend vs, That laughing, or else lying Our beds were Cables and Ropes, euery feather at the least 20. fatham long. downe did make Our backes and sides sore, and our ribs to ake. On Saturday the windes did seeme to cease, And brawling Seas began to hold their peace, When we (like Tenants) beggerly and poore, Decreed to leaue the Key beneath the doore, But that our Land-lord did that shift preuent, Who came in pudding time, and tooke his Rent, And as the Sunne, was from the Ocean peeping, We lanch'd to Sea againe, and left house-keeping. When presently we saw the drisling skies 'Gan powt and lowre, and Winds and Seas 'gan rise, Who each on other plaid their parts so wilde, As if they meant not to be reconcilde, The whilst we leape vpon those liquid hills, Where Porposes did shew their fins and Gills, Whilst we like various Fortunes Tennis ball, At euery stroake, were in the Hazzard all. And thus by Rye, and I walk'd to Winchelsey, where I thanke my Couzin M?. Collins, the Maior there, hee made me kindely welcome. Winchelsey we past By Fairlegh, and those Rockie cliffs at last. Some two miles short of Hastings, we perceiu'd The Lee shore dangerous, and the Billowes heau'd, Which made vs land (to scape the Seas distresse) Within a harbour, almost harbourlesse, (We giue God thanks) amongst the Rocks we hit, Yet were we neither wash'd or sunke, or split. Within a Cottage nigh, there dwels a Weauer Who entertaind vs, as the like was neuer, No meat, no drinke, no lodging (but the floore) No Stoole to sit, no Locke vnto the doore, No straw to make vs litter in the night, Nor any Candlesticke to hold the light, To which the Owner bid vs welcome still, Good entertainement, though our cheare was ill. The morrow when the Sun with flushed face In his diurnall course began to trace, The wind exceeding stiffe and strong and tough, The Seas outragious, and extremely rough, Our Boate laid safe vpon the Beachy sand, Whilst we to Hastings went or walk'd by land. Much (to that Towne) my thankfulnesse is bound, Such vndeserued kindnesse there I found. Three nights we lay there, and three daies we spent, Most freely welcom'd, with much merriment. Kinde M? Maior his loue aboue the rest: Me and my crue, he did both feed and feast, He sent vs Gold, and came himselfe to vs; My thankes are these, because his loue was thus. Mine Host and Hostesse Clayton thus I thanke And all good fellowes there, I found so franke, That what they had, or what could there be got, They neither thought too heauy or too hot. The windes and Seas continued still their course, Inueterate seem'd their rage, vntam'd their force, Yet were we loth to linger and delay: But once againe to venture and away. Thus desperately resolu'd, 'twixt hope and doubt, Halfe sunke with lanching, madly we went out, At twelue a clocke at noone, and by Sun-set To Miching, or New Hauen we did get. There almost sunke (to saue our Boat at last) Our selues into the shallow Seas we cast: And pluck'd her into safety to remaine Till Friday that we put to Sea againe. Then 'mongst our old acquaintance (storms &amp; flaws) At euery stroake neere deaths deuouring iawes: The weary day we past through many feares, And land at last quite sunke o'r head and eares. All dropping dry, like fiue poore Rats half drownd, From succour farre, we halde the Boat on ground, Cast out our water, whilst we brauely drop'd, And vp and downe to drie our selues we hop'd. Thus we our weary Pilgrimage did weare, Expecting for the weather calme and cleare: But stormes, flawes, windes, seas, tooke no minutes rest, Continuall fiercely blowing, West Southwest. A Town call'd Goreing, stood neere two miles wide, To which we went, and had our wants supplide: There we relieu'd our selues (with good compassi?) With meat and lodging of the homely fashion. To bed we went in hope of rest and ease, But all beleaguer'd with an Host of Fleas: Who in their fury nip'd and skip'd so hotly, That all our skins were almost turn'd to motly. The bloudy sight endur'd at least sixe houres, When we (opprest with their encreasing pow'rs) Were glad to yeeld the honour of the day Vnto our foes, and rise and runne away: The night before, a Constable there came, Who ask'd my Trade, my dwelling, and my name: My businesse, and a troope of questions more, And wherefore we did land vpon that shore? To whom I fram'd my answers true, and fit, (According to his plenteous want of wit) But were my words all true, or if I li'd, With neither I could get him satisfi'd. The Maiors name was M?. Richard Boyse, a Gentleman, whose laudable life, and honest gouerment is much beloued and approued. He ask'd if we were Pyrats? We said no, (As if we had, we would haue told him so.) He said that Lords sometimes would enterprise T'escape, and leaue the Kingdome, in disguise: But I assur'd him on my honest word, That I was no disguised Knight or Lord. He told me then that I must goe sixe miles T'a Iustice there, Sir Iohn, or else Sir Giles: I told him I was loth to goe so farre: And he told me, he would my iourny barre. Thus what with Fleas, and with the seuerall prates Of th'Officer, and his Ass-sociats, We arose to goe, but Fortune bade vs stay: The Constable had stolne our Oares away, And borne them thence a quarter of a mile, Quite through a Lane, beyond a gate and stile, And hid them there, to hinder my depart, For which I wish'd him hang'd with all my heart. A Plowman (for vs) found our Oares againe, Within a field well fill'd with Barly Graine. Then madly, gladly out to Sea we thrust, Gainst windes &amp; stormes &amp; many a churlish Gust: By Kingston Chappell, and by Rushington, By little Hampton, and by Middleton, To Bognors fearefull Rockes, which hidden lie Two miles into the Sea, some wet, some dry: There we suppos'd our danger most of all, If we on those remorcelesse Rockes should fall: But by th'Almighties mercy and his might, We Row'd to Selsey, where we stay'd all night. There, our necessity could haue no Law, For want of beds, we made good vse of Straw, Till Sol, that old continuall Traueller From Thetis lap, 'gan mount his flaming Car. The weather kept it's course, and blow'd &amp; rag'd, Without appearance it would e'r be swag'd, Whilst we did passe those hills, &amp; dales, &amp; Downs, That had deuour'd great ships, and swallow'd Towns. Thus after six or fiue houres toyle at least, We past along by Wittering, West, and East, Vpon the Lee shore still the winde full South, We came neere Chichesters faire Hauens mouth. And being then halfe sunk, and all through wet, More fear'd then hurt, we did the Hauen get. Thus in that harbour we our course did frame To Portsmouth, where on Munday morne we came. Then to the Royall Fleet we Row'd aboord, Where much good welcome they did vs affoord. To the Lord Generall, first my thankes shall be, His bounty did appeare in gold to me, And euery one aboord the Prince I found, In stead of want, to make their loues abound, Captaine Penrudduck there amongst the rest, His loue and bounty was to vs exprest, Which to requite, my thankfulnesse I'l show, And that I'l euer pay, and euer owe. On Tuesday morning we with maine and might, From Portsmouth crost vnto the Ile of Wight: By Cowes stout Castle, we to Yarmouth hasted. And still the windes and Seas fierce sury lasted. On Wedn'sday we to Hursts strong Castle crost, Most dangerously sowsd, turmoyl'd and tost: Good harbour there we found, and nothing deere, I thanke kinde Matthew Figge, a right good fellow. M. Figge, the Porter there, He shew'd vs there a Castle of defence Most vsefull, of a round circumference: Of such command, that none can passe those Seas Vnsunke, or spoyl'd, except the Castle please. On Thursday, we, our Boat row'd, pull'd and hal'd Vnto a place, which is Key Hauen call'd. The winde still blowing, and the Sea so high, As if the lofty waues would kisse the skie, That many times I wish'd with all my hart, My selfe, my Boat, and Crue, all in a Cart; Or any where to keepe vs safe and dry, The weather raged so outragiously. For sure I thinke the memory of man (Since windes and Seas to blow or flow began) Cannot remember so stormy weather In such continuance, held so long together, For ten long weekes e'r that, tis manifest, The wind had blown at South or west Southwest, And rais'd the Seas: to shew each others power, That all this space (calme weather) not one hower, That whether we did goe by Sunne or Moone, At anytime, at midnight, or at noone: If we did launce, or if to land we set, We still were sure to be halfe sunke, and wet. Thus toyling of our weary time away, That Thursday was our last long look'd for day: For hauing past, with perill, and much paine, And plow'd, &amp; furrow'd, o'r the dangerous maine, O'r depths, and flats, and many a ragged Rocke, We came to Christ-Church Hau'n at fiue a clocke. Thus God, in mercy, his iust iudgement sparing, (Gainst our presumption, ouer-bold, and daring) Who made vs see his wonders in the deepe, And that his power alone aloft did keepe Our weather-beaten Boate aboue the waues, Each moment gaping to be all our Graues. We sinking scap'd: then not to vs, to Him Be all the Glory, for he causd vs swim. And for his mercy was so much extended On me (whose temptings had so farre offended) Let me be made the scorne and scoffe of men, If euer I attempt the like agen. My loue, my duty, and my thankfulnesse, To Sir George Hastings I must here expresse: His deedes to me, I must requite in words, No other payment, poore mens state affords. With fruitlesse words, I pay him for his cost, With thanks to M?. Templeman mine host. So leauing Christ-Church, and the Hauen there, With such good friends as made vs welcome cheer: Some serious matter now I must compile, And thus from verse to prose I change my stile.

My hearty condemnations I send forth Vnto a crue of Rascals nothing worth, (Yet in some sort I wrong their high reputes: Some of them are worth hanging for their sutes) Such as (to pay debts) haue the meanes, not mindes, Whose words, and bonds, are constant as the winds, Such as thinke satisfaction is a sinne, And he most vertuous that's in debt most in, Such, for whose sakes, (to my apparent losse) To Germany, I twice the Seas did crosse, To Scotland all on foot, and backe from thence, Not any Coyne about me for expence, And with a Rotten weake Browne paper Boate, To Quinborough, from London I did floate: Next to Bohemia, o'r the raging Maine, And troublous lands, I went and came againe. Next, with a Wherry, I to Yorke did Ferry, Which I did finde a voyage very merry. And lastly, late I made a desperate Iaunt, From Famous London, (somtimes Troynouant) To Salisbury, through many a bitter blast, I, Rockes, and Sands, and foaming Billowes past, That in ten thousand mouthes, the City round, The lying, flying newes was, I was drown'd But I may see them hang'd before that day, Who are my Debtors, can, and will not pay: These toylesome passages I vndertooke, And gaue out Coyne, and many a hundred Booke, Which these base Mungrels tooke, and promist me To giue me fiue for one, some foure, some three: But now these Hounds, no other pay affords, Then shifting, scornefull lookes, and scuruy words; And sure I thinke, if I should harrow Hell, VVhere Diuels, and cursed Reprobates do dwell, I might finde many there, that are their betters, And haue more conscience, then my wicked debters. Thus to my seuen-fold troope of friends and foes, My thankes, and angry Muse, thus onward goes. A KICKSEY VVINSEY, OR, A LERRY COME-TWANG: Wherein Iohn Taylor hath Satyrically suted seuen hundred and fifty of his bad debtors, that will not pay him for his returne of his iourney from Scotland. 1. My thankes to those that haue paid. You worthy Worthies, of that liberall Tribe, Who freely gaue your words, or did subscribe: And were not itch'd with the vain-glorious worme, To write and lye, but promise and performe, Black Swans of Britaine, I protest you are, And seeme (to me) each one a Blazing Starre; For this inconstant Age so few affoords Of men, whose deeds do counterpoise their words, That finding one, me thinkes I see a wonder, More then Decembers Fruit, or Winters Thunder; Ingratitude, I hold a vice so vile, That I could ne'r endure't a breathing while: And therefore cre I'l proue a thanklesse Iade, Time in his course shall runne quite retrograde; Yea, euery thing shall hate his proper kinde, Before I'l harbour an ingratefull minde: And still I vow to quit you in some part, With my best wishes, and a thankfull heart. So much to you, my Muse hath sung or said, Whose louing bounties hath the Sculler paid. 2. Those that would pay if they could. And as for you that would pay if you could, I thank you, though you do not as you should, You promis'd faire, and wrote as free as any, But Time hath altered since, the case with many; Your moneyes, like low Tides, are eb'd too low, And when, 'tis lowest 'twill begin to flow. To seek a breech from breechlesse men 'twere vain, And fruitlesse labour would requite my paine: It were no Charity (as I suppose) To bid one wipe his nose, that wants a nose; And sure my Conscience would be lesse then little, T'enrich my selfe, by robbing of the Spittle: No, honest friends (to end this vaine dispute) Your barren states may spring, &amp; bring forth fruite; Your wills are good, and whilst I keepe your bills, In stead of Payment I accept good wills; On hope and expectation I will feede, And take your good endeauours for the deede: Praying that Crosses in your mindes may cease, And Crosses in your purses may increase. 3. Those that are hard for me to finde, and being found, were better lost. Another sort of debtors are behinde, Some I know not, and some I cannot finde: And some of them lie here and there, by spirts, Shifting their lodgings oftner then their shirts. Perchance I heare where one of these men lies, And in the morning vp betimes I rise, And finde in Shorditch where he lodg'd a night; But he to Westminster hath tane his flight. Some two dayes after thither doe I trot, And finde his lodging, but yet finde him not, For he the night before (as people tell) Hath tane a Chamber about Clarken-well. Thither goe I, and make a priuy search, Whilst he's in Southwark, neer S. George his Church. A pox vpon him, all this while thinke I, Shall I ne'r finde out where my Youth doth lye? And hauing sought him many a weary bout, At last, perhaps I finde his chamber out: But then the Gentleman is fast in bed, And rest hath seas'd vpon his running head: He hath tooke cold with going late by water, Or sate vp late at Ace, Deuse, Trey, and Cater, That with a Sinke of fifty pieces price, He sleepes till noone before his Worship rise; At last he wakes; his man informes him strait, That I at dore doe on his pleasure wait; Perhaps I am requested to come neere, And drinke a cup of either ale or beere, Whilst sucking English fire, and Indian vapor, At last I greet him with my bill of Paper: Well Iohn (quoth he) this hand I know is mine, But I this day doe purpose to goe dine At the halfe Moone in Milk-street, prethee come, And there wo'l drinke, and pay this petty Summe. I take my leaue, he in his sleeue doth laugh, Whilst I beleeue him, (like Iohn hold my staffe) I in the Tauerne stay, and wait his pleasure, And he to keepe his word can finde no leasure. Thus many a street by me recrost and crost, I in and out, and to and fro, am tost, And spend my time and coyne to finde one out, Which hauing found, rewards me with a flout. In this base fashion, or such like as this, To me their scuruy daily dealing is: As one's in's study, t'other's deepe in talke, Another's in his Garden gone to walke: One's in the Barbers suddes, and cannot see, Till chin and chaps are made a Roman T: And for his making thus a Gull of me, I wish his cut may be the Græcian P. These men can kisse their claws, with Iack, how is't? And take and shake me kindely by the fist, And put me off with dilatory cogges, And sweare and lye, worse then a sort of dogs, Protesting they are glad I am return'd, When they'd be gladder I were hang'd or burn'd. Some of their pockets are oft stor'd with chinke, Which they had rather waste on drabs, dice, drinke, Then a small petty summe to me to pay, Although I meet them euery other day; For which to ease my mind to their disgrace, I must (perforce) in Print proclaime them base; And if they pay me not (vnto their shames) I'l print their trades their dwellings &amp; their names, That boyes shall hisse them as they walke along, Whilst they shal stink, &amp; do their breeches wrong: Pay then, delay not, but with speed disburse, Or if you will, try but who'l haue the worse. 4. Those that will and doe daily pay me in drinke and smoake. A fourth crue I must drop from out my quill, Are some that haue not paid, yet say they will: And their remembrance giues my muddy mood, More ioy then of those that will ne'r be good. These fellowes my sharpe Muse shall lash but soft, Because I meet them to their charges oft, Where at the Tauerne (with free frollicke hearts) They welcome me with pottles, pints, and quarts; And they (at times) will spend like honest men, Twelue shillings, rather then pay fiue or ten. These are Right Gentlemen, who beare a minde To spend, and be as liberall as the winde: But yet their bounty (when they come to pay) Is bountifull in nothing but delay. These I doe seeke from place to place, These make me not to run the wildgoose chase; These doe from day to day not put me off, And in the end reward me with a scoffe. And for their kindnesse, let them take their leasure, To pay or not pay, let them vse their pleasure. Let them no worser then they are, still proue: Their pow'rs may chance out-do me, not their loue; I meet them to my perill, and their cost, And so in time there's little will be lost. Yet the old prouerbe I would haue them know, The horse may starue the whilst the grasse doth grow. 5. Those that are dead. A fift sort (God be with them) they are dead, And euery one my quittance vnder's head: To aske them coyne, I know they haue it not, And where nought is, there's nothing to be got, I'l neuer wrong them with inuectiue lines, Nor trouble their good heires, or their as-signes. And some of them, their liues losse to me were, In a large measure of true sorrow deere; As one braue Lawyer, whose true honest spirit Doth with the blest celestiall soules inherit, He whose graue wisedome gain'd preeminence, To grace and fauour with his gracious Prince; Adorn'd with learning, lou'd, approu'd, admir'd, He, my true friend, too soone to dust retir'd. Besides, a number of my worthy friends (To my great losse) death brought vnto their ends: Rest, gentle spirits, rest, with Eternizing, And may your corpes haue all a ioyfull rising: There's many liuing, euery day I see, Who are more dead then you in pay to me. 6. Those that are fled. A sixt, with tongues glib, like the tailes of Eeles, Hath shew'd this land and me foule paires of heeles. To Ireland, Belgia, Germany, and France, They are retyr'd to seeke some better chance. 'Twas their vnhappy inauspicious Fate, The Counters, or King Luds vnlucky Gate; Bonds being broke, the stones in euery street, They durst not tread on, lest they burnt their feet; Smoke by the Pipe, and Ginger by the race, They lou'd with Ale, but neuer lou'd the Mace. And these mens honesties are like their states, At pittious, wofull, and at low-priz'd rates; For partly they did know when they did take My bookes, they could no satisfaction make. And honesty this document doth teach, That man shall neuer striue aboue his reach, Yet haue they reacht, and ouer-reacht me still, To do themselues no good, and me much ill. But farewell, friends, if you againe doe come, And pay me either all, or none, or some: I looke for none, and therefore still delay me, You onely doe deceiue me, if you pay me. Yet that deceit from you were but my due, But I looke ne'r to be deceiu'd by you. Your stockes are poore, your Creditors are store, Which God increase, and decrease, I implore. 7. Those that are as farre from honesty, as a Turke is from true Religion. Seuenthly, and last's a worthy worthlesse crue, Such as heau'n hates, &amp; hell on earth doth spew, And God renounce, &amp; dam them, are their praiers, Yet some of these sweet youths are good mens heirs: But vp most tenderly they haue bin brought, And all their breeding better fed then taught: And now their liues float in damnations streame, To stab, drab, kil, swil, teare, sweare stare, blaspheme: In imitation worse then diuels Apes, Or Incubusses thrust in humane shapes: As bladders full of others wind is blowne, So selfe-conceit doth puffe them of their owne: They deeme their wit all other men surpasses, And other men esteem them witlesse asses. These puckfoyst cockbrain'd coxcombs, shallow pated, Are things that by their Taylors are created; For they before were simple shapelesse wormes, Vntill their makers lick'd them into formes. Tis ignorant Idolatry most base, To worship Sattin Satan, or gold lace, T'adore a veluet varlet, whose repute Stinks odious, but for his perfumed suite. If one of these to serue some Lord doth get, His first taske is to sweare himselfe in debt: And hauing pawn'd his soule to Hell for oathes, He pawns those othes for newfound fashi? clothes. His carkasse cased in this borrowed case, Imagines he doth me exceeding grace: If when I meet him, he bestowes a nod, Then must I thinke me highly blest of God. Perhaps (though for a Woodcocke I repute him,) I vaile my bonnet to him, and salute him: But sure my salutation is as euill, As Infidels that doe adore the Diuell. For they doe worship Satan for no good, Which they expect from his infernall mood, But for they know he's author of all ill, And o'r them hath a power to spoyle and kill: They therefore doe adore him in the durt, Not hoping any good, but fearing hurt. So I do seeme these mimmicks to respect, Not, that from them I any good expect; (For I from dogs dung can extract pure honey, As soone as from these widgeons get my money) But I (in courtesie) to them haue bowde, Because they shall not say, I am growne proud; And sure if harmelesse true humility, May spring from money, wanting pouerty, I haue of debtors such a stinking store, Will make me humble, for they'l keepe me poore. And though no wiser then flat fooles they be, A good lucke on them, they're too wise for me; They with a courtly tricke, or a flim flam, Do nod at me, whilst I the noddy am: One part of Gentry they will ne'r forget, And that is, that they ne'r will pay their debt. To take, and to receiue, they hold it fit, But to requite, or to restore's no wit. Then let them take and keepe, but knocks, and pox, And all diseases from Pandora's box. And which of them sayes that I raue or raile, Let him but pay, and bid me kisse his T. But sure the Diuell hath taught them many a tricke, Beyond the numbring of Arithmeticke. I meet one, thinking for my due to speake, He with euasions doth my purpose breake, And asks what newes I heare from France or Spain, Or where I was in the last showre of raine; Or when the Court remooues, or what's a clocke, Or where's the wind (or some such windy mocke) With such fine scimble, scemble, spitter spattar, As puts me cleane besides the money-matter? Thus with poor mungrell shifts, with what, where, when? I am abused by these things, like men, And some of them doe glory in my want, They being Romists, I a Protestant: Their Apostaticall iniunction saith, To keepe their faith with me, is breach of faith: For 'tis a Maxim of such Catholicks, 'Tis Meritorious to plague Hereticks; Since it is so, pray pay me but my due, And I will loue the Crosse as well as you. And this much further I would haue you know, My shame is more to aske, then yours to owe: I begge of no man, 'tis my owne I craue, Nor doe I seeke it but of them that haue, There's no man was inforc'd against his will, To giue his word, or signe vnto my bill. And is't not shame, nay, more then shame to heare, That I should be return'd aboue a yeare, And many Rich-mens words, and bils haue past, And tooke of me both bookes, both first and last, Whilst twice or thrice a weeke, in euery street, I meet those men, and not my mony meet. Were they not able me amends to make, My conscience then would sooner giue then take: But most of those I meane, are full purs'd Hindes, Being beggerly in nothing but their mindes: Yet sure me thinkes, if they would doe me right, Their mindes should be as free to pay, as write. Neer threescore pounds, the books I'm sure did cost, Which they haue had from me, and I thinke lost: And had not these mens tongues so forward bin, Ere I my painefull iourney did begin, I could haue had good men in meaner Rayment, That long ere this, had made me better payment: I made my iourney for no other ends, But to get money, and to try my friends: And not a friend I had, for worth or wit Did take my booke, or past his word, or writ: But I (with thankefulnesse) still vnderstood They tooke, in hope to giue, and doe me good. They tooke a booke worth 12. pence, &amp; were bound To giue a Crowne, an Angell, or a pound. A Noble, piece, or halfe piece, what they list, They past their words, or freely set their fist. Thus got I sixteene hundred hands and fifty, Which summe I did suppose was somwhat thrifty; And now my youths, with shifts, &amp; tricks, &amp; cauils, Aboue seuen hundred, play the sharking Iauils. I haue performed what I vndertooke. And that they should keepe touch with me I looke: Foure thousand, and fiue hundred bookes I gaue To many an honest man, and many a knaue; Which books, and my expence to giue them out, (A long yeere seeking this confused rout) I'm sure it cost me seuenscore pounds and more, With some suspition that I went on score. Besides, aboue a thousand miles I went, And (though no mony) yet much time I spent; Taking excessiue labour, and great paines, In heat, cold, wet, and dry, with feet and braines: With tedious toyle, making my heart-string sake, In hope I should content both giue, and take, And in requitall now, for all my paine, I giue content still, and get none againe. None, did I say? I'l call that word agen, I meet with some that pay now and then, But such a toyle I haue those men to seeke, And finde (perhaps) 2, 3, or 4. a weeke, That too too oft, my losings gettings be, To spend 5. crownes in gathering in of three. And thus much to the world I dare auow, That my oft walkes to get my money now, With my expences, seeking of the same, Returning many a night home, tyr'd and lame, Meeting some thirty, forty in a day, That sees me, knowes me, owes me, yet none pay. Vs'd and abus'd thus, both in towne and Court, It makes me thinke my Scottish walke a sport: I muse of what stuffe these men framed be, Most of them seeme Mockado vnto me, Some are Stand-further off, for they endeauer, Neuer to see me, or to pay me neuer. When first I saw them, they appeared Rash, And now their promises are worse then trash; No Taffaty more changeable then they, In nothing constant, but no debts to pay. And therefore let them take it as they will, I'l canuase them a little with my quill. To all the world I humbly doe appeale, And let it iudge, if well these men doe deale, Or whether for their basenesse, 'twere not fitter, That I should vse more gall, and write more bitter? I wrot this booke before, but for this end, To warne them, and their faults to reprehend; But if this warning will not serue the turne, I sweare by sweet Satyricke Nash his vrne, On euery pissing post, their names I'l place, Whilst they past shame, shall shame to shew their face, I'l hale fell Nemesis, from Dis his den, To ayde and guide my sharpe reuenging pen; That fifty Popes Buls neuer shall roare lowder, Nor fourscore Cannons wh? men fire their powder. And sure, my wronged Muse could lines indite, So full of horror, terror, and affright, That they (like Cain) confessing their estates, But little better then base Reprobates; And hang themselues in their despairing moods, But that I'l not be guilty of their bloods. No, let such fellowes know, that Time shall try My mercie's greater then their honesty: Nor shall my verse affoord them no such fauour, To make them saue the hangman so much labour, They are contented still to patch and palter, And I (with patience) wish them each a halter, They are well pleas'd to be perfidious fellowes, And my reuenge bequeathes them to the gallowes: For I would haue them thus much vnderstand, Words are but winde, 'tis money that buyes land: Words buy no food, or clothes to giue content, Bare words will neuer pay my Landlord rent. And those that can pay Coyne, and pay but words, My minde, a mischiefe to them all affoords, I count them like old shooes, past all mens mending, And therefore may the Gallowes be their ending: If some of them would but ten houres spare From drinking, drabbing, and superfluous fare, From smoaking English fire, and heathen stinke, The most of them might well pay me my chinke. There's no wound deeper then a pen can giue, It makes men liuing dead, and dead men liue; It can raise honour drowned in the sea, And blaze it forth in glory, Cap. a. pea. Why, it can seale the battlements of Heauen, And stellifie men 'mongst the Planets seuen: It can make mizers, peasants, knaues and fooles, The scorn of goodnesse, and the diuels close stooles. Forgot had bin the thrice three Worthies names, If thrice three Muses had not writ their fames: And if it not with flatt'ry be infected, Good is by it extold, and bad corrected. Let Iudgement iudge them, what mad men are those That dare against a pen themselues oppose, Which (when it likes) can turn them al to loathing, To any thing, to nothing, worse then nothing. Yet e'r I went, these men to write did like, And vs'd a pen more nimbly then a pike; And writ their names (as I suppos'd) more willing, Then valiant Soldiers with their Pikes are drilling. But this experience, by these men I finde, Their words are like their payment, all but winde; But what winde 'tis, is quickly vnderstood, It is an euill winde, blowes no man good: Or else they make it to the world appeare, That writing is good cheape, and paying deare. No paper bill of mine had edge vpon it, Till they their hands and names had written on it; And if their iudgements be not ouer-seene, They would not feare, the edge is not so keene. Some thousands, and some hundreds by the yeare Are worth, yet they their piece or halfe piece feare; They on their owne bils are afraid to enter, And I vpon their pieces dare to venter: But whoso at the bill hath better skill, Giue me the piece, and let him take the bill. I haue met some that odiously haue lied, Who to deceiue me, haue their names denied; And yet they haue good honest Christian names, As Ioshua, Richard, Robert, Iohn and Iames: To cheat me with base Inhumanity, They haue denide their Christianity, A halfe piece, or a Crowne, or such a summe, Hath forc'd them falsifie their Christendome: Denying good, ill names with them agree, And they that haue ill names, halfe hanged be, And sure I thinke, my losse would be but small, Is for a quittance they were hang'd vp all. Of such I am past hope, and they past grace, And hope and grace both past's, a wretched case, It may be that for my offences past, God hath vpon me this disturbance cast: If it be so, I thanke his Name therefore, Confessing I deserue ten times much more; But as the Diuell is author of all ill, So ill for ill, on th'ill he worketh still; Himselfe, his seruants, daily lye and lurke, Mans cares on earth, or paines in hell to worke. See how the case then with my debtors stands: They take the diuels office out of's hands; Tormenting me on earth, for passed euils, And for the diuell, doth vex me worse then diuels. In troth 'tis pitty, proper men they seeme, And those that know them not, would neuer deeme That one of them would basely seeme to meddle, To be the diuels hangman, or his beadle. For shame, for honesty, for both, for either, For my deserts desertlesse, or for neither Discharge your selues fr? me, you know wherefore, And neuer serue or helpe the Diuell more. I haue heard some that Lawyers doe condem, But I still must, and will speake well of them; Though neuer in my life they had of me Clarkes, Counsellors, or yet Atturneyes fee. Yet at my backe returne, they all concurr'd, And payd me what was due, and ne'r demurr'd. Some Counter Serieants, when I came agen, (Against their nature) dealt like honest men. By wondrous accident perchance one may Grope out a needle in a load of hay: And though a white Crow be exceeding rare, A blind man may (by fortune) catch a Hare, So may a Serieant haue some honest tricks, If too much knauery doth not ouermix. Newgate (the Vniuersity of stealing) Did deale with me with vpright honest dealing. My debtors all (for ought that I can see) Will still remaine true debtors vnto me; For if to paying once they should incline, They would not then be debtors long of mine. But this report I feare, they still will haue, To be true debtors euen to their graue. I know there's many worthy proiects done, The which more credit, and more coyne haue won, And 'tis a shame for those (I dare maintaine) That breake their words, &amp; not requite their paine: I speake to such, if any such there be, If there be none, would there were none for me. But M? Barnard Caluard too well knowes The fruits of windy promise, and faire showes, With great expence, and perill, and much paine He rode by land, and crost the raging Maine In fifteene houres, he did ride and goe, From Southwarke neere to Callice, to and fro. When he vnto his cost, and detriment, Shewed vs a memorable president, In finding out a speedy worthy way, For newes 'twixt France and London in one day; And yet this well deseruing Gentleman, Is cheated of his Coyne, do what he can, From him they could both goods and money take, But to him they'l no satisfaction make, Their promises were fiue, or ten for one, And their performances are few, or none. Therefore it is some comfort vnto me, When such a man of ranke, and note, as he, Instead of Coyne is paid with promises, My being cheated grieues me much the lesse; Of worthy Gentlemen, I could name more, That haue past dangers both on seas and shore, And on good hopes did venture out their gold, To some that will no faith, or promise hold, But basely do detaine, and keepe backe all Th' expected profit, and the principall; Yet this one comfort may expell our crosse, Though we endure, time, coyne, and labors losse: Yet their abuse doth make our fame more great, 'Tis better to be cheated, then to cheat. Those that are dead, or fled, or out of Towne: Such as I know not, nor to them am knowne, Those that will pay (of which ther's some small number) And those that smile to put me to this cumber, In all they are eight hundred and some od, But when they'l pay me's onely knowne to God. Some crownes, some pounds, some nobles, some a royall, Some good, some naught, some worse, most bad in triall. I, like a boy that shooting with a bow Hath lost his shaft where weedes and bushes grow; Who hauing search'd, and rak'd, and scrap'd, &amp; tost To finde his arrow that he late hath lost: At last a crotchet comes into his braine, To stand at his first shooting place againe; Then shoots, and lets another arrow flye, Neere as he thinkes his other shaft may lye: Thus ventring, he perhaps findes both or one, The worst is, if he lose both, he findes none. So I that haue of bookes so many giuen, To this compared Exigent am driuen: To shoote this Pamphlet, and to ease my minde, To lose more yet, or something lost to finde. As many brookes, foords, showres of rain &amp; springs, Vnto the Thames their often tribute brings, These subiects paying, not their stocks decrease, Yet by those payments, Thames doth still increase: So I that haue of debtors such a swarme, Good they might do me, and themselues no harm Inuectiue lines, or words, I write nor say To none but those that can, and will not pay: And whoso payes with good, or with ill will, Is freed from out the compasse of my quill. They must not take me for a Stupid asse, That I (vnfeeling) will let these things passe. If they beare mindes to wrong me, let them know, I haue a tongue and pen, my wrongs to show; And be he ne'r so briske, or neat, or trim, That bids a pish for me, a tush for him; To me they're rotten trees, with beauteous rhinds, Fayre formed caskets of deformed minds. Or like dispersed flocks of scattered sheepe, That will no pasture, or decorum keepe: Some wildly skipping into vnknowne grounds. Stray into forraine and forbidden bounds; Where some throgh want, some throgh excess haue got The scab, the worme, the murraine, or the rot. But whilst they wander guidelesse, vncontrolde, I'l doe my best to bring them to my folde; And seeing sheepefold hurdles here are scant, I am inforced to supply that want With rayling: and therefore mine owne to win, Like rotten forlorne sheepe, I'l rayle them in. FJNJS. Taylors Motto. DEDICATED TO EVERY BODY. Yet not to euery Reader doe I write, But onely vnto such as can Read right: And with vnpartiall censures can declare, As they find things, to iudge them as they are. For in this age, of Criticks are such store, That of a B. will make a Battledore, Swallow downe Camells, and at Gnats will straine, Make Mountaines of small Molehills, and againe Extenuate faults, or else faults amplifie, According as their carping censures flye. Such are within the Motto of I haue, But though the gallant Gulls be ne'r so braue, And in their owne esteeme are deemed wise, I haue a mind their follies to despise. There are some few that wil their iudgement season With mature understanding, and with reason: And call a spade a spade, a Sicophant, A flatt'ring Knaue, and those are those I want. For those that seeme to read, and scarce can spell, Who neither point, nor keepe their periods well: Who doe a mans inuention so be-martyr, So hanging, drawing, and so cut and quarter, Making good lines contemptible threed-bare, To keepe my booke from such as those I care. Adue. Iohn Taylor. TAYLORS MOTTO. ET HABEO, ET CAREO, ET CVRO. J HAUE, I VVANT, I CARE. In this poem footnotes are anchored in the text. Where anchors and footnotes do not correspond, no attempt has been made to match them. Is any man offended? marry gep With a horse nightcap, doth your Iadeship skip? Although you kicke, and fling, and wince and spurn, Yet all your Colts-tricks will not serue your turne. Vice hath infected you, 'gainst vertues force, With more diseases then an aged horse; If all trades falle; of VVaterman I will turne Farrier. I doe not thinke that any Horse-leech can blazon such a pedigree of marching maladies.For some of you are hide-bound greedily, Some haue the yellowes of false Ielousie, Some with the staggers, cannot stand vpright, Some blind with Bribes, can see to doe no right, Some foundred, that to Church they cannot goe, Broke-winded some, corrupted breath doth blow, Some hoofe-bound, some surbated, and some graueld With trauelling, where they shuld not haue traueld, Some are crest-falne through th'immoderate vice Of gorgeous outsides, smoake, and drinke and dice, And some are full of mallenders and scratches, The neck-cricke, spauins, shouldersplat, and aches, The ring-bone, quitter-bone, bots, botch, and scab, And nauelgall, with coursing of the Drab. The back-gall, light-gall, wind-gall, shackle-gall, And last, the spur-gall, the worst gall of all. A good sound horse needs not my whip to feare, For none but Iades are wrung i'th'withers here. And doe these Hackneyes thinke to runne on still, (Without a bit or snaffle) as they will, And head-strong prancing through abuses, dash, And scape without a Satyrs yerking lash? No, they must know, the Muses haue the might, The vniust iustly to correct and smite, To memorize victorious Vertues praise, To make mens fame or shame out-liue their dayes; To force iniustice (though it doe looke bigge) With his owne nayles his cursed graue to digge: T'emblaze the goodnesse of a man that's poore, And tell the vices of an Emperour. All this the Muses dare, and will, and can, Not sparing, fearing, flattring any man. And so dare I, (if I iust cause doe see) To write, from feare, or hate, or flattry free, Or taxing any in particulere, But generall at all, is written here. For had I meant the Satyre to haue plaid, In Aqua fortis, I would whips haue laid, And mixt my inke (to make it sharpe with all) With sublimate, and Cockatrices gall, Which, with a Satyres spleene, and fury fierce, With the least ierke, would to the entrailes pierce, And with a lash that's lustily laid on, Would strip and whip the world, vnto the bone: I know that none at me will spurne or kicke, Whose consciences no villany doth pricke, And such as those will in their kennels lye, And gnar and snarle, and grumble secretly, But with full mouth, they dare not barke or bite, But fret within, with rancor and despight. For why (before the world) I make a vow, There doth not liue that male, or female now, 'Gainst whom I haue so much as is a thought, Much lesse, against them are my Verses wrought. This Motto in my head, at first I tooke, In imitation of a better Booke: And to good mindes I no offence can giue, To follow good examples, whilst I liue: For I had rather to abide detraction, And be an Ape in any honest action: Then wilfully into a fault to runne, Though it before had by a King bin done. I haue not here reuil'd against my betters, Which makes me fear no dungeon, bolts, or fetters: For be he ne'r so great, that doth apply My lines vnto himselfe, is worse then I. Smooth is my stile, my method meane and plaine, Free from a railing, or inuectiue straine: In harmelesse fashion here I doe declare, Mine owne rich wants, poore riches, and my care, And therefore at my wants let no man grieue, Except his charges will the same relieue: And for my Wealth (except a rotten Boat) I neuer feard the cutting of my throat. And those that for my cares doe enuy me, Shall in them (if they list) great sharers be. All my taxations are in generall, Not any personall, or nationall: The troubles now in France, I touch not here, Nor of the Britaine Fleete before Argiere. Nor of the forces that the Turke doth bring, Against the Poland Kingdome and their King, Of Count Buckoy, of Beth'lem, Gabor, or Of Spinola, or any Ambassador, Nor Denmarks King, nor of the Emperour, Nor Netherlands great Nauigable pow'r, Nor of Religious points my Muse doth chant, Of Romish Catholicke, or Protestant: Of Brownist, Hussite, or of Caluinist, Arminian, Puritan, or Familist, Nor against Corporation, trade, or Art, My poore inuention speakes in any part. And therefore Critticke, snarle, and snap, and hang, If inwardly thou feele my Satyres fang: Tis wisedome in thee, if thy spleene thou hide, And mend thy selfe, before thy faults be spide. Thus as I boldly haue begun to enter, Couragiously I'l thorow the businesse venter. Et Habeo, I haue. I haue a Soule, which though it be not good, 'Twas bought at a deare rate, my Sauiours Blood: And though the Diuell continually doe craue it, Yet he that bought it, hath most right to haue it. I (with my foule) haue power to vnderstand, The summe of my Creators great Command: And yet I haue a Law within me still, That doth rebell against his Sacred Will. But though (through merit) I haue Hell deseru'd, Through Mercy yet I haue a Heau'n reseru'd. I haue a reason, which can diffrence make 'Twixt good and bad, to choose, and to forsake: I haue a working, forward, and free will, Wherewith I haue inclined to doe ill. I haue a Conscience, which doth tell me true, That for my sinnes the wrath of God is due: And to relieue that Conscience terrifi'd, I haue a Faith in Iesus Crucifi'd. I haue a iudgement, by the which I see, And iudge, how good and bad things diffrent bee: And with iust Censure, I distinguish can, The oddes beeweene a monster and a man. But when with iudgement on my selfe I looke, I straightwayes am with feare and horror strooke: And finding my afflicted Conscience grudg'd, I iudge my selfe, for feare of being iudg'd. I haue a Knowledge, by the which I know, That all that's good in me, God did bestow: And all my thoughts, and words, and actions euill, I haue them (like my neighbors) from the Deuill. By this my Knowledge, sometimes skill I haue, To know an honest man, and know a knaue: To know where I fare well, to come againe, Where Friends for loue doe onely entertaine, To know that Enuy, Pride and Letchery, Sloth, Wrath, Auarice, and Gluttony, Doth make the world dance Antique in a string, And all their followers to confusion bring. I know that griping base Extortion, As it gets wealth without proportion, Eu'n so, without proportion, rule or measure, Shall be consum'd that most accursed Treasure. I know a swearer, when I heare his Oathes, I know a Gull, although he weare good Cloathes, I know a Prodigall, by's lauish spending, I know a Foole (my selfe) by too much lending. I know I haue discharged others Score, But will (for ought I know) doe so no more. I know, that foure and twenty letters teaches Al the whole worlds tongues, languages &amp; speaches. I know that I not any word can frame, But in some Language 'tis an Anagram. And though the world of sundry parts consists, Yet all the world are Anagramatists. I know the numbers numberlesse of faces, That were, are, shall be, at all times, and places, Are all vnlike each other, for we see, They each from other may distinguish'd be. I know, the difference of these voyces are Vnlike each other, being neere, or farre, And that mens seuerall writings are contrary, And in some things from one another vary, And by this knowledge I haue inward sight, How that the workes of God are infinite. I haue credulity, that when I heare A man auouch a thing, protest and sweare, I haue giu'n credit to him by and by, Although the wicked wretch did sweare and lye, Because I haue a hope that want of grace, Doth not our Makers Image quite deface, As that a man who hath wit, sence, or reason, Dares to commit so horrible a treason, As to call God to witnesse of his lies, Thereby to countenance his villanies. Thus through simplicity, and light beliefe, I haue belieu'd an arrant whore, or thiefe. I haue opinion, and haue euer had, That when I see a stagg'ring drunken swad: Then that a man worse then an Asse, I see, Because an Asse will neuer drunken be. And yet in mine opinion I am bold, (That friendship and society to hold) The merry spending of an idle houre, To take a cup, or two, or three, or foure, If soberly the meeting be well ended, Tis tolerable, and to be commended, And yet I haue my imperfections too, Which make me daily doe, as others doe: For I (like many rich men) now and than, Make shew to be a very honest man: But strong temptations dog me euery houre, Which to resist I haue so little pow'r, That if (perhaps) I had their meanes, I thinke, I should (as they doe) dice, and drab, and drinke, And through infirmity, or wilfulnesse, Run greedily to Riots vaine excesse: For Honors do change Manners; wealth and place Are (oftentimes) temptations to disgrace, And did some Greatmen cast vp their account, To what their vaine expences doe amount; So much for needlesse quarts, so much for smk Paid so much for Eringoes, (to prouoke) So much for Coach-hire, so much for a whore, With Item, not three halfe-pence to the poore. And who knowes, if I had their meanes, I say, But I should be as very a Knaue as they? For I haue imperfections, and a will. And fraile infirmities, t'attempt what's ill, That I in no good action cannot stand, Except supported by th'Almighties hand. I haue a sence and feeling simpathy, Of others woe, and want, and misery: If one man doth doe good, another bad, I (for them both) can be both glad, and sad. For when I see a Great man raysed hye, I haue a sence of his Nobility, And wish, that all his Actions still may be, To make him worthy of his dignitie. But when I see that Fortune 'ginnes to frowne, And from her fickle wheele to cast them downe, Though their foule faults I hate and doe abhor, Yet as th'are men, I haue a pitty for. For when a whore is whip'd, a Bawdi'th Cart, A drunkard in the stockes, for his desert: An arrant Knaue, or periurde wretch to stand, And makes the Pillory his falling band; Or one, whose backward Fortune doth preuaile, To make a bridle of a Horses taile, With riding Retrograde, i'th streets proclaime, On their own backs &amp; brests, their faults &amp; shame; When any Villaine for his fault is tortur'd, A Thiefe, or Traytor, hang'd, or drawn &amp; quarterd: As I doe hope for mercy from Aboue, As they are men, they doe my pitty moue, And I doe grieue, the Diuell hath so much pow'r, Mans Reason, and Alleageance to deuoure; And that of Grace they laid no faster hold, But fall into these mischiefes manifold. I haue a Fortune that attends on me, For neuer will I Fortunes vassal be: And let her frowne or smile, or hang her selfe, And giue me either pouerty or pelfe, Or cast me low, or lift me vp on hye, Yet (spight her teeth) I'l liue vntill I dye. For all mans outward happinesse, are things Ty'd and bound fast to fickle Fortunes wings: Which when she list, she will alight and stay. And when her wheele but turnes, she flies away. She's bountifull to fooles, and therefore I Haue small share in her liberality. On wise men she doth fauours seldome fix: For wisedome scorns her slights and iugling tricks; And yet no industry of man aliue, (If Fortune frowne on him) can make him thriue. For why, so pow'rfull is the purblinde witch, To raise vp knaues, and make fooles diuelish rich, To set an Asse on top of all her wheele, And to kicke vertue backward, with her heele: To raise a Piper, Pander, or a Iester, And therefore hang the Hag, I doe detest her. She hath strange tricks, and works for diuers ends, To make a Great man haue more kin then friends. But seldome she this good report doth win, To make a poore man haue more friends then kin. A King in's Throne, a Generall in the warre, Places of best command, and reuerence are. But yet if Fortune frowne on their affaires, They shall be rich in nothing but in cares. Shee's like a Ianus with a double face, To smile and lowre; to grace, and to disgrace; She lou's and loathes, together at an instant, And in inconstancy is onely constant. Vncertaine certaine, neuer loues to settle, But here, there, euery where; in dock, out nettle. The man whom all her frownes or fauours spurne, Regardeth not her wheele, how oft it turnes. A wise man knowes she's easier found then kept, And as she's good, or bad, he doth accept. He knowes she comes intending not to stay, And giu's but what she meanes to take away. For by discretion it is truly knowne, Her liberall gifts she holds still as her owne. And vnto me her bounty hath bin such, That if she tak't againe, I care not much. I haue a loue which I to God doe owe, With which I haue a feare doth in me grow: I loue him for his goodnesse, and I feare To anger him, that hath lou'd me so deare. I feare in loue, as he's a gracious God, Not loue for feare of his reuenging Rod. And thus a louing feare in me I haue, Like an adopted sonne, not like a slaue. I haue a King whom I am bound vnto, To doe him all the seruice I can doe: To whom when I shall in Alegeance saile, Let all the Diuels in hell my soule assaile; If any in his gouernment abide, In whom foule Treacherous malice doth recide 'Gainst him, his Royall off-spring or his friends, I wish that Halters may be all their ends. And those that cannot most vnfainedly Say this, and sweare, as confident as I: Of what degree soe'r, I wish (one houre) They were in some kind skilfull Hangmans power. I haue a life was lent me 'fore my birth, By the great Landlord both of Heau'n and Earth: But though but one way vnto life is common, For All that euer yet was borne of woman, Yet are there many thousand wayes for death, To dispossesse vs of our liues, and breath. For why, the Lord of life (that life doth make) Will (as he pleaseth) life both giue and take, And let me (blamelesse) suffer punishment, Or losse of goods, or causelesse banishment, Let me be hang'd, or burn'd, or stab'd, or drownd, All's one to me, so still my Faith keepe sound, Then let my life be ended, as God will, This is my minde, and hope shall be so still: To get to Heau'n, come thousand deaths together, Th'are welcome pleasures, if they bring me thither. I know for certaine, all Mortality, When it begins to liue, begins to dye; And when our liues that backe againe we giue, We euer endlesse then doe dye, or liue. When good men wish long life, 'tis vnderstood That they would longer liue, to doe more good: But when a bad man wisheth to liue long, It is because he faine would doe more wrong. And this one reason giues me much content, Though I shall haue no Marble Monument, Where my corrupted Carkasse may inherit, With Epitaphs, to blaze my want of merit, To waste as much to pollish and be-guild, As would a charitable Almes-house build. All which a gouty Vsurer, or worse, May haue, and haue poore peoples heauy curse, That many times the sencelesse Marble weeps, Because the execrated corps it keepes. When the meane space, perhaps the wretched soule, In flames vnquenchable doth yell and howle. I haue a hope, that doth my heart refresh, How-e'r my soule be sundred from my flesh: Although I haue no friends to mourne in sacke, With merry insides, and with outsides blacke; Though ne'r so poorely they my corps interre, Without bell, booke, or painted Sepulcher, Although I misse these trifles Transitory, I haue a hope my soule shall mount to glory. I haue a vaine in Poetry, and can Set forth a knaue to be an honest man; I can my Verses in such habit clad, T'abuse the good, and magnifie the bad. I can write (if I list) nor Rime or Reason, And talke of fellony and whistle Treason, And Libell against goodnesse (if I would) And against misery could raile and scould; Foule Treachery I could mince out in parts, Like Vintners pots, halfe pints, and pints &amp; quarts. Euen so could I, with Libels base abound, From a graine waight, or scruple, to a pound, With a low note I could both say or sing, As much as would me vnto Newgate bring, And straining of my voyce a little higher, I could obtaine the Fleet at my desire: A little more aduancing of my note, I from the Fleet, might to the Gatehouse flote. Last, aboue Ela raising but my power, I might, in state be mounted to the Tower. Thus could my Muse (if I would be so base) Run carelesse, by degrees, into disgrace, But that for loue of goodnesse I forbeare, And not for any seruile slauish feare. Time seruing vassalls shall not me applaud, For making of my Verse a great mans Bawd: To set a lustre, and a flatt'ring glosse, On a dishonourable lump of drosse; To slabber o'r a Ladies homely feature, And set her forth for a most beauteous creature. Nor shall my free inuention stoope t'adore, A fowle diseased, pocky painted whore. Rewards or bribes my Muse shall ne'r entice, To wrong faire Vertue, or to honor Vice. But as my Conscience doth informe me still, So will I praise the good, condemne the ill. That man is most to be abhord of men. Who in his cursed hand dares take a pen, Or be a meanes to publish at the presse Prophaned lines, or obsceane beastlinesse, Scurrility, or knowne apparant lyes, To animate or couer villanies; A halter for such Poets, stead of Bayes, Who make the Muses whores, much worse then Thais, Such Rascals make the Heliconian well, (In estimation and respect) like hell. And of all good men iustly are rewarded, Contemn'd and scorn'd like hellhounds, vnregarded. For Poetry (if it be vs'd aright) Sets forth our Makers mercy, and his might: For though (through ignorance) it hath some foes, God may be prais'd in Verse as well as prose. Poets in Comedies are fit for Kings, To shew (them Metaphoricall) such things As is conuenient they should know and heare, Which none but Poets dare to speake for feare. A Poet's borne a Poet, and his trade Is still to make: but Orators are made: All Arts are taught and learn'd, we daily see, But taught a Poet, neuer yet could be. And as the Tree is by the fruit well knowne, So by his writing is a Poet showne; If he be well dispos'd, hee'l well indite, If ill inclinde, he viciously will write. And be he good or bad, in his condition, His Lines will shew his inward disposition. And to conclude this point and make an end, The best amongst them hath much need to mend. I haue a tongue, and could both sweare and lye, (If to such customes, I would it apply) But often swearing now and then forsweares, And lying, a mans credit quite out weares; I'l trust an arrant Thiefe to keepe my purse, As soone as one that loues to sweare and curse: For can it be that he that takes a vse, And custome, God in swearing to abuse, Can it be thought he will make Conscience then, To play the false dissembling Knaue with men? Nor can my supposition euer dreame, That he who dares his Makers name blaspheme, But that if Time would but occasions bring, He would betray his Countrey, and his King. For 'tis a Maxim, (no man can conuince) The man that feares not God, loues not his Prince. And he that cares not for his soule, I thinke, Respects not, if his Country swim or sinke. To lying I beare such a hate, that I Will neuer (wittingly) affirme a lye: I will not say, but I a lye may say, But I will not affirme it any way: Tis the maintaining falshoods to be true, To whom a lyers odious name is due. That all vntruths are falshoods, none denies, But sure all falshoods cannot be cald lies. For Esops fables, Ouids art-like fictions, (Although they are 'gainst truth meere contradictions, Of humane transformations from their kind, Of disputations 'twixt the Sunne, and winde. Of fowles, and beasts, and riuers, trees, and stones, To tell each other of their ioyes or mones, Of men tr?sform'd to dogs, beares, bulls, swine, apes, Which shewes that treasons, murders, incests, rapes, Turne men into worse forms then beastly creatures, When reason's dispossest by brutish natures. A fiction, fable, or a harmelesse iest I tolerate, but lyes I doe detest. Th'Egyptians had a Law, that euery lyer Should strait-way be beheaded, for their hyre. But if that Law were executed here, Few Pettifoggers would be found I feare. The very Court would sorfeit now and than, Many a complementing Gentleman. But sure the City were the greatest share, Where lying buyes and sells a world of ware; The Countrey sometimes would a head allow, In selling Corne, a Horse, a Sow, a Cow: And then a headsman would get store of pelfe, If he could but refraine to lye himselfe. I haue a memory like (as I doe find) A wallet, halfe before, and halfe behind. In the fore-part my neighbors faults I put, Behind (quite from my sight) mine owne are shut. Thus partiality runnes like a streame, To spy a Moat and not to see a Beame. But when as reason memory collects, T'examine my owne impotent defects, Then doth it vnto me such things record, As make me (almost) of my selfe abhord. It tells me, I was in corruption borne. And to corruption that I shall returne. It tells me, that betwixt my birth and this, I haue done thousand thousand things amisse: It bids me to remember what I am, To what place I must goe, and whence I came, And with those thoughts, when as my mind is hye, I am deiected through humility. And this all Great men well remember may, They are but Honourable clods of clay: Or Reuerend Right Worshipfull graue dust, And (whence they came) againe they thither must. I say, if foolish females, with faire features, Would but remember they were mortal Creatures, And that as their good Grandams dy'd before, Eu'n so must they, and must be seene no more, And all their gawdy glory be forgot, Whilst they shall lye, consume, and stinke, and rot: If these things they would to remembrance call, Their honyed pleasures would be mix'd with Gall, And all and euery one their course would bend, Within themselues, what is amisse so mend. The memory, vnto the soule is food, That thinks, &amp; saies, &amp; doth the thing that's good. I haue a heart doth like a Monarch raigne, Who in my Microcosme doth lawes ordaine: Affections, Sences, Passions, Subiects, Slaues, Some like good Courtiers, some like flatt'ring knaues With show of Vertue, hiding of their Vice, They bring their Lord t'a foolish Paradise; For when the heart thinkes swearing an abuse, Then Anger saies it is a manly vse, And when to quaffe, the minde hath no intent, Affection saies, 'tis honest merriment, The minde calls Letchery abomination, Sence saies, 'tis Gentlemanlike recreation, The minde holds Couetousnesse worse then theft, Sence calls it Husbandry, and frugall thrift, Reason delights in liberality, Sence counsels it to prodigality. And thus these vassalls doe their King mislead, (Whilst Reason seemes to be asleepe or dead.) And thus this little Kingdome man doth fade, With hearing Traytors, when they doe perswade. I haue experience, by the which I finde, That some, though poore in purse, are rich in minde: And they that haue of wealth the greatest store, Are, in content, most miserable poore: There's many a Mammonist doth houses keepe, With lofty Turrets, and with Sellers deepe; With a most stately porch, and spacious hall And kitchin, lesser then a Coblers stall, Where (in two dayes) a poore halfe racke of Mutton. Proclaimes the Master of the house no Glutton, Where soule-bewitching gold in bondage is, (As may the keepers be, in hells abisse.) Where waking thoughts keepe still the mind opprest, And frightfull dreames make rest, to be vnrest, And whereas feares by night, and doubts by day Driue happinesse, and sweet content away, Much better then is my estate then theirs, I haue content, and they the golden cares: I can feed well at home, and soundly sleepe, And what I haue, not care to lose or keepe. I haue consideration, to perceiue What's best for me to take, and what to leaue: When I consider, pleasures past and gone, Doth adde affliction, to affliction, Though he that's low can very hardly rise, Yet he that's high, oft falls to miseries. He that is downe, his feare's already past, Whilst he that's vp, may haue a slippery cast, I doe consider, that I oft did craue, Things both from God and men, vnfit to haue: And many times, through inconsiderate wit, Gifts, giuers and receiuers are vnfit. He is a liberall man, that doth deny, That which will doe the askers iniury; There is a bounty, which I will reueale, That he ne'r giu's in vaine, that giu's in zeale: As prodigality brings want and woes, So liberality makes friends of foes. Tis better for a man his purse to hold, Then giue, to make a begger proud, or bold. True bounty is (on earth) a speciall grace, And hath in heauen prepar'd a glorious place. For as the Sunne vnto the moone giu's light, Which light she giues againe to vs by night: So God doth giue his gifts to lib'rall men, Which they (to men that want) doe giue agen. But he that giues, should strait forget it quite, What they that take, in memory should write. And I accept alike, great gifts, and small, Onely to me the giuers mind is all. Tis a base bounty when a man relieues These prostituted Whores, or Knaues, or Theeues: For still the Diuell is bountifull to those, That vnto Vertue, are inueterate foes. But many hold it for a generous part, To giue a man that's drunke, theother quart: And in a humor (to haue Drawers trouble) Throw pottle Pots down stairs, to come vp double; When strait vpon their knees, they all accord, To drinke a health to some vnworthy Lord: Some fusty Madam, or some carpet Knight, 'Till they can neither speake, or stand vpright. Then being all abominable drunke, A Gallant drinkes a health vnto his Punke: The which withall Sir Reuerence strait they are Inioynd to doe, vpon their knees, all bare. If any dare deny to pledge the Drab, He's in great danger of a mortall Stab: For he accounts it worse then blasphemy, That one should there his Mistris health deny, Vntill at last o'r charg'd with too much wine, They wallow in their vomits, worse then swine. Thus many a beastly rude Barbarian, Gaines little of a lib'rall Gentleman. A worthy spirit, a rare Noble sparke, True bred, a merry Greeke, or man of marke. A right mad Troian, a most ex'lent blade, As bountifull a man as e'r God made. Thus many an idle fellow gets a name Of Bountifull, through deeds of sinne and shame. Indeed he's liberall, that spends health and wealth, And precious Time, in drinking others health: If dropsie Drunkards falne to pouerty, Should beg a Pension of his Maiesty, And in their humble sutes would make it knowne, How drinking of his healths, they lost their owne, I thinke, his Highnesse iustly would relieue them, And (for Rewards) to each a Halter giue them. But is't not strange, that man so mad should be, Idolatrous, bare-headed on his knee, Bow and fall downe vnto an absent Whore, As th'only Saint (or diuell) he doth adore? But e'r he'l kneele vnto his God, to craue For mercy, his infected soule to saue: Before he'l beg Gods pardon for his crimes, He sweares him o'r and o'r a hundred times, And takes it for a Gentlemanlike grace, To spit his venome 'gainst his Makers face, And with his Othes as false, as blacke is white, God dam him, or renounce, or sinke him quite: Refuse him (or if not refuse) forsake him, And now &amp; then sweares, Then the Diuel take him. Thus he in ordinary talke affords, 'Mongst (truth &amp; lies) more othes then other words; These are the bounteous youths I care not for, And these I haue a heart that doth abhor. From a rich knaue of worshipfull degree, I haue a minde to spare my cap and knee: To a good man that's honest, poore and wise, I haue a heart that my affection tyes. Some sixteene times I on the Seas haue beene, In Spaine and Germany both out and in, At Cales, at Ostend, Prague, and many a where, And yet I doe thanke God, Cham here, Cham here. I haue a Wife which I was wont to prayse, But that was in my yonger wooing dayes: And though she's neither Shrew, nor Sheep (I vow With Iustice) I cannot dispraise her now. She hath an Instrument (that's euer strung, To exercise my patience on) her tongue. But past all question, and beyond all doubt, Shee'l ne'r infect my forehead with the Gout. A married man (some say) has two dayes gladnesse, And all his life else, is a lingring sadnesse: The one dayes mirth is, when he first is married, Th'other's, when his wife's to burying carried. One I haue had, should I the other see, It could not be a day of mirth to me. For I (as many haue) when I did woo, My selfe (in tying fast) did not vndoo: But I haue by my long experience found, I had beene vndone, had I not beene bound. I haue my bonds of marriage long enioy'd, And doe not wish my obligation voyd. I haue a house where I doe eat and sleepe, But bread, nor meat, or drinke in it (I keepe.) For many Lords, and great men keepe good meat, But I spend mine, to make good fellowes eat. And though no Turrets doe my house bedecke, There one may breake his fast, before his necke. I haue a trade, much like an Alchymist, That oft-times by extraction, if I list, With sweating labour at a woodden Oare, I'l get the coyn'd refined siluer Ore. Which I count better then the sharking tricks Of cooz'ning Tradsemen, or rich Politicks, Or any proud foole, ne'r so proud or wise, That doth my needfull honest trade despise. I haue some troubles, by the which I know, How flattring friends doe ebbe, and foes doe flow: Prosperity increaseth friendship much, But aduerse Fortune tries them with the tutch, By troubles and by crosses I gaine wit, When daily pleasures doe diminish it. Thus (by his pow'r that All-sufficient is) I haue had time and pow'r to write all this: And I haue hope that He the time will grant, That I may tell of some things that I want. The Motto of I haue is large and wide, Which largely here, I could haue amplifide, For I haue Ioy, and Loue, and Comforts here, And I haue folly, sorrow, doubt and feare; I haue (in part) my frailty here reueal'd, I haue some Vices which I haue conceal'd. I haue done as I haue, then if I haue But pleas'd my friends, I haue gain'd what I craue. Yet my, I haue, as great is euery iot, And as small too as any mans haue not. Et Careo, I want. Strange is the penance of my humble Muse, That must tell what I want without excuse. What man (without much torture) would confesse His want, his beggery, and guiltinesse; But that the World would thinke him to be mad, Or that he very small discretion had? Yet (at this time) it is my fatall lot, To tell I want, what other men want not. And therefore to declare my wants most plaine, I want a bragging or a boasting vaine; In words or writing, any wayes to frame, To make my selfe seeme better then I am. I want faire vertue to direct my course, And stand against the shock of vices force; And (of my selfe) I no way can resist, 'Gainst Hell, the World, the Flesh, or Antichrist: For ought I know, I want a courage stout, Afflictions and temptations to keepe out: And I doe feare, should time of triall come, My constancy would bide no Martyrdome. But to helpe what I want, I want despaire, And hope supplies my want in all my care: And as I want that bold-fac'd impudence, As may giue iust occasion of offence: So doe I want base flatt'ry with my pen, To sooth my selfe, or to taxe other men. I doe want goodnesse, for I cleerely see, All good I doe or say, is not from me. And amongst all the benefits I craue, Goodnesse I want, and goodnesse I would haue. A man may seeme too iust, too full of wit, But to be too good, neuer man was yet. He that is great, is not made good thereby, But he that's good, is great continually. Thus great and good together's rare and scant, Whilst I no greatnesse haue, all goodnesse want. I doe want wit t'inuent, conceiue and write, To moue my selfe or others to delight: But what a good wit is, I partly know, Which (as I can) I will define and show. Wit is the off-spring of a working braine, That will be lab'ring, though it be in vaine: 'Tis call'd the Mother wit, by which I finde, She's of the bearing, breeding, femall-kinde. And some haue of their mothers wit such store, That in their fathers wisedome they are poore. A good wit is a vertue that excells, And is the house where vnderstanding dwells: With whom the mind, and memory, and sence, And reason, keepe continuall residence: For why, if Reason chance to be away, Wit, (like a Colt) breaks loose and runnes astray. There's many that haue got their wealth by wit: But neuer wealth had power to purchase it. Rich fooles, and witty beggers euery where, Are the third part of Mankinde very neere, And little friendship doth blind Fortune grant To me; for wit and mony both, I want. Yet for mine eares price I could vndertake To buy as much as would a Lybell make: Or I could haue as much, as fits these times With worthlesse Iests, or beastly scuruy Rimes: To serue some Lord, and be a man of note, Or weare a guarded vnregarded Coat. Wit for a foole I thinke enough I haue; But I want wit to play the crafty knaue: And then the Prouerbe I should finely fit, In playing of the foole, for want of wit. To Archie (at the Court) I'l make a iaunt, For he can teach me any thing I want, And he will teach me for a slender fee, A foolish knaue, or knauish foole to bee. Garret growes old and honest, and withall, His skill in knauish fooling is but small: The Knight o'th' Sunne can caper, dance and leape, And make a man small sport exceeding cheape. In the old time, a wise man was a foole, That had compar'd himselfe with great Otoole. But his good dayes are past, he's downe the winde, In both his eyes and vnderstanding blinde. But holla, holla, Muse, come backe againe, I was halfe rauisht with a fooling vaine: And, if I had gone forward with full speed, I'd plaid the foole for want of wit indeed. As Frogs in muddy ditches vse to breed, So there's a wit that doth from Wine proceed: And some doe whet their wit so much thereon, Till all the sharpenesse and the steele is gone; With nothing left but back, the edge gone quite, Like an old Cat, can neither scratch nor bite. The wit I want, I haue, yet yeelds no profit, Because a foole hath still the keeping of it. Which had it in a Wisemans head beene planted, I should not now want, what I long haue wanted; I want that vndermining policy; To purchase wealth with foule dishonesty: And I doe want, and still shall want, I hope, Such actions as may well deserue a Rope. I want a mind, bad company to haunt, Which if I doe, it seemes I foresight want, I want a Kingdome, and a Crowne to weare, And with that want, I want a world of care. But might I be a King, I would refuse it, Because I doe want wisedome how to vse it. When an vnworthy man obtaines the same, He's rais'd to high preferment for his shame: For why, the office of a King is such, And of such reuerence as I dare not tutch: Like to the Thunder, is his voyce exprest, His Maiesty, as Lightning from the East, And though he want the art of making breath, Hee's like a Demy-God, of life and death. And as Kings (before God) are all but men, So before men, they all are gods agen. Hee's a good King, whose vertues are approu'd, Fear'd for his Iustice, for his mercy lou'd: Who patternes all his Royall dignity, By the iust rule of Heauens high Maiesty, Who can distribute (to good mens content) Reward for vertue, vices punishment, Who loues a poore mans goodnesse, and doth hate All foule corruption in a man of State, Combin'd in loue with Princes neere and farre, Most affable in peace, powerfull in warre: And aboue all, religious, full of zeale, To guard the Church, &amp; guide the Common-weale. And though such Kings as this, haue seldome beene, Yet such a King as this I oft haue seene. And as I want a Regall power and fame, I want Reuenues to maintaine the same: I thinke a King that's made of I should beleeue all were Gold that glisters. Ginger-bread, His Subiects would obey him with more dread: And any knaue that could but kisse his Claw. And make a leg, would make me but Iack-Daw. And as the Swallow all the Summer stayes, And when the winter comes, he flyes his wayes: So flatt'rers would adore my happinesse, And take their flight, and leaue me in distresse, To praise my vices, all the swarme of them Would flocke, and all my vertues would condem. Much worse then Rauens is their flattery, For Rauens eate not men vntill they dye: But so a flatt'ring knaue may get and thriue, He daily will deuoure a man aliue. Besides, the body onely feeds the Fowle: But flattery oft consumes both body and soule. For like to trencher-Flies they euer proue, Who still wait more for lucre then for loue. Thus, though I want a Kingly power Royall, 'Tis 'gainst my will, to want will to be loyall. And if that any King aliue there bee That willingly would change estates with mee, I in my bargaine should haue gold for brasse, And he would be accounted but an Asse. For any Kings estate, be't ne'r so bad, To change it with Iohn Taylor, were starke mad. A King of Clubs keeps subiects in more awe: For he commands his Knaue (except at Maw) A King of Spades hath more wit in his pate, To delue into the secrets of his state: The King of Diamonds is too rich and wise, To change his pleasures for my miseries. And for the King of Hearts, he's so belou'd, That to exchange with me, he'l ne'r be mou'd. For I am full of feares and dangerous doubts, And poorer farre then is a King of Clouts: I therefore will a Subiect still remaine, And learne to serue, that am vnfit to reigne. I want ten millions of good coyned gold, And with that want, want troubles manifold; But if I had so much, what man can tell, But that I should want grace to vse it well? Within the walls and skirts of Troynouant, Many that haue most goods, most goodnesse want: For Charity and Riches seldome can Haue both possession in a wealthy man. Fooles that are rich with multitudes of Pieces, Are like poore simple sheepe with golden fleeces: A knaue, that for his wealth doth worship get, Is like the Diuell that's a cock-horse set. For money hath this nature in it still, Slaue to the goodman master to the ill. The Couetous amidst his store is poore, The minde content is rich and seekes no more. Who couets most, hath least; who couets least, Hath most; for why, sufficient is a feast. Wealth vnto mischiefes might my mind inchant, And therefore 'tis much good for me I want. I want a Sonne and Heyre, and I perceiue, That he no portion could from me receiue; Vnlesse I could bequeath him Poetry, To adde more pouerty to pouerty, But as I doe want Children, I want care, And iealousie, in which some Fathers are: For many of them rake and toyle (God wot) To gather wealth for Heyres they ne'r begot: And run to Hell (through mischiefes) greedily, For other mens misgotten Bastardy. The greatest females vnderneath the skye, Are but fraile vessels of mortality: And if that Grace and Vertue be away, There's Honour's shame, and Chastitie's decay. For, if inconstancy-doth keepe the dore, Lust enters, and my Lady proues a Whore: And so a Bastard to the World may come, Perhaps begotten by some stable Groome, Whom the fork-headed, her cornuted Knight May play and candle with, with great delight, And thus by one base misbegotten sonne, Gentility in a wrong line may run: And thus foule lust to worship may prefer The mungrell Issue of a Fruterer, Or yeoman of the Bottles it may be: Or some vnmannerd rascall worse then he, And though the Stripling vp in yeeres doth grow, He shall want wit his father how to know: But he shall know one that will father him, And with good bringing vp maintaine him trim: And loues him with affection, as he were His owne most nat'rall Primogeniter In my English Latine Richard Swary, I finde or coynd this worthy word.. The old Knight dyes and freely giues him all, And he being growne a Gallant faire and tall, If with his cursed wealth he purchase can, To wed the Daughter of some Nobleman, And being thus enuobled much thereby, Through his Alliance with Nobility; He may in time possesse an honour'd state, Which God doth curse, and all good people hate: Then shall be search'd, if possible it be, Before Cams birth, to finde his Petigree: Then is some famous coat of Armes contriu'd, From many worthy families deriu'd. And thus may Lust &amp; Wealth rayse many a Clown, To Reputation, and to high Renowne. Thus many good men are deceiu'd (perhaps) In bowing of their knees, and doffing Caps, And courteously commit Idolatry, To a proud branch of Lust and Letchery. For my part, I want meanes to gull men so, I may be gull'd with others goodly show. If any finde my Children meate or cloth, I got them in my sleepe, I'l take mine oth, I cannot be deceiued in my Heyres, As some that are my betters may in theirs, And as no Bastards my free mind perplexe, So I want Iealousies, which some men vexe. Should thousands such as Hercules combine, T'inspire with Iealousie this brest of mine, Nor all the Goatish foule luxurious brood, Could not possesse me with that frantike mood, She that I haue, I know her continence, And she as well doth know my confidence; There is no anchor in the text for this note.— The Heralds of this Office dwell at Nullibi. And yet, for ought you know, both she and I May want both honesty and Iealousie: Though of our selues our knowledge is but small; Yet somewhat we doe know, and God knowes all. The man whose wife will be a whore indeed, His Iealousie stands but in little steed: Nor can bolts, locks, or walls of brasse suffice Briareus hundred hands, nor Argos eyes; Nor all the wit in man or Diuels pate, Can alter any mans allotted fate: For if a Woman be to lewdnesse giuen, And is not guided with the grace of Heauen; Shee will finde oportunity and time, In spight of watch or ward, to doe the Crime: But if she be with heauenly blessings grac't, As outward beautifull, and inward chaste; Then may foule iealousie and false suspition, Against her nature alter her condition, From good to bad, from bad to naught, and worse, And turne her vertues to a vicious course. For nothing can an honest minde infect, So soone as iealousie and false suspect; And this foule Fury many times hath wrought, To make the bad worse and the good stark naught: But neuer yet by it (as I could heare) The good or bad, one iot the better were: And therefore be my wife, or good, or ill, I iealousie doe want, and want it will. I want dissimulation to appeare, A friend to those, to whom I hatred beare: I want the knowledge of the thriuing Art, A holy outside, and a hollow heart: But as I am, the same I'l euer seeme, Not worse, or better, in mine owne esteeme, For what attire soe'r my corps doth hide, Or whether I doe goe on foot or ride: Or were I with the Kings high fauour grac'd, Or at a great Lords boord, at dinner plac'd, And should I haue all this, I were no more But a poore Waterman, that at his Oare Doth (for a liuing) labour, tug, and pull, And carries both the Gallant and the Gull. How-euer others doe esteeme of me, Yet as I am, I know my selfe to be. If I doe chance to be in company, Well welcom'd, amongst true Gentility, I know, in them it is a courteous part, And that in me it can be no desert. I want that high esteemed excellence Of sustian or Mockado Eloquence, To flourish o'r, or bumbast out my stile, To make such, as not vnderstand me, smile; Yet I with Non-sence could contingerate, With Catophiscoes Terragrophicate, And make my selfe admir'd immediately, Of such as vnderstand no more then I. Besides, I want the knowledge and the skill, How these my lines may passe now well or ill: For as a learned Poet lately writ With a comparison, comparing fit Mens writings and inuentious like to Cheese, Which with some stomacks very well agrees Some loue it, and some cannot well disgest it, Some care not for it, and some quite detest it; And so my line, to sundry hands may come, Some pleasing, and displeasing vnto some: One likes it well, and very well commends it, A second sweares 'tis naught, and madly rends it, A third cries mew, and scrues his iawes awry, And in a scornfull humour layes it by: Thus some like all, some somwhat, &amp; some nothing, And one mans liking is anothers lothing. I want hope to please all men where I come, I want despaire, and hope I shall please some; I want ingratitude to friends, I want A willing mind, (what's written) to recant: I want 'gainst any man peculiar spite, I want a selfe-loue vnto what I write: I want some friends that would my want supply, I want some foes that would my patience try. If all things that I want, I here should tell, To a large volume then my booke would swell; For though my selfe in wants doe boldly beare, My wants of such great weight, and number are, That sure the burden of the things I want, Would breake the backe of any Elephant. Et Curo, I Care. I care to thinke vpon the Theame I write, For Care is carefull, yeelding no delight: And though Care flowes like a continuall streame, Yet Care is but a very barren Theame. Vpon I care not, my swift Muse could iog, Like to an Irish Lackery o'r a bog; But my poore wit must worke vpon I care, Which is a subiect (like my wit) most bare. I care to keepe my wife in that degree, As that she alwayes might my equall be: And I doe care, and at all times endeuer, That she to haue the mastership shall neuer. I Care, and so must all that mortall are; For from our births, vnto our graues, our care Attends on vs, in number like our sinnes, And sticks vnto vs close, as doe our skins; For the true Anagram of Learned Latine Lads tell me, that Curo comes neere curro. Care is Race, Which shewes, that whilst we on the earth haue place, So many miseries doe vs insnare, That all our life is but a Race of Care; And when I call my life vnto account, To such great numbers doe my Cares amount, That Cares on Cares my mind so much doe lade, As I of (nothing else but) Cares were made. When I conceiue I am besieged round With enemies, that would my soule confound, As is the Flesh, the World and ghostly Fiends, How (seu'rally) their force and flatt'ry bends, To driue me to presumption or despare, T'auoid temptations I am full of care. When I consider what my God hath done For me, and how his grace I daily shun: And how my sinnes (for ought I know) are more Then Stars in sky, or Sands vpon the shore, Or wither'd leaues that Autumne tumbles downe, And that sinnes leprosie hath ouergrowne My miserable selfe from head to heele, Then hopefull feares, and fearefull cares I feele. When I doe see a man that conscience makes Of what he speakes, or doth, or vndertakes; That neither will dissemble, lye, or sweare, To haue the loue of such a man I care. I care, when I doe see a Prodigall (On whom a faire estate did lately fall) When as is spent his credit and his chink, And he quite wasted to a snuffe, doth stink, Who in the Spring, or Summer of his Pride, Was worship'd, honor'd, almost deifi'd: And (whilst the golden Angels did attend him) What swarms of friends, and kindred did befriend him, Perswading him, that giue, &amp; spend, &amp; lend, Were vertues which on Gentry doe depend? When such a fellow falne to misery, I see forsaken and in beggery, Then for some worthy friends of mine I care, That they by such examples would beware. A foole is he who giues (himselfe t'impaire) And wise is he who giues what he may spare: But those that haue too much, and nothing giue, Are slaues of Hell, and pitty 'tis they liue. But as the prodigall doth vainely spend, As thogh his ill sprung wel-spring, ne'r would end, Yet in his pouerty he's better much, Then a hard-hearted miserable Clutch; Because the Prodigall lets mony flie, That many people gaine and get thereby. A Prodigall's a Common-wealths man still, To haue his wealth all common, tis his will, And when he wants, he wants what he hath not, But misers want what they both haue, and got. For though man from the teate hath weaned bin, Yet still our infancy we all are in, And fr? our birth, till death our liues doth smother, All men doe liue by sucking one another. A King with Clemency and Royalty, Doth sucke his Subiects loue and loyalty: But as the Sea sucks in the Riuers goods, And Riuers backe againe, sucke in the floods, So good Kings, and true Subiects, alwayes proue To suck from each, protection, feare, and loue. All Clients whatsoe'r are Lawyers nurses, And many times they doe sucke dry their purses: But though the Lawyer seemes in wealth to swim, Yet many great occasions doe sucke him. The Prodigalls estate, like to a flux, The Mercer, Draper, and the Silkman sucks: The Taylor, Millainer, Dogs, Drabs and Dice, Trey-trip, or Passage, or The most at thrice; At Irish, Tick-tacke, Doublets, Draughts or Chesse, He flings his money free with carelessenesse: At Nouum Mumch?ce, mischance, (chuse ye which) At One and thirty, or at Poore and rich, Ruffe, slam, Trump, noddy, whisk, hole, Sant, Newcut. Vnto the keeping of foure Knaues he'l put His whole estate at Loadum, or at Gleeke, At Tickle-me quickly, he's a merry Greeke, At Primefisto, Post and payre, Primero, Maw, Whip-her-ginny, he's a lib'rall Hero; At My-sow-pigg'd: and (Reader neuer doubt ye, He's skill'd in all games, except) Looke about ye. Bowles, shoue-groate, tennis, no game comes amiss, His purse a nurse for any body is; Caroches, Coaches, and Tobacconists, All sorts of people freely from his fists, His vaine expences daily sucke and soake, And he himselfe sucks onely drinke and smoake: And thus the Prodigall, himselfe alone, Giues suck to thousands, and himselfe sucks none. But for the miser, he is such an euill, He sucks all, yet giues none sucke but the Deuill: And both of them such cursed members are, That to be neither of them both I care. Thus young, old, all estates, men, maids, &amp; wiues, Doe sucke from one another, all their liues; And we are neuer wean'd from sucking thus, Vntill we dye, and then the wormes sucke vs. I care when I want money, where to borrow, And when I haue it, then begins new sorrow: For the right Anagram of woe is owe. And he's in woe that is in debt I know: For as I car'd before to come in debt, So being in, my care is out to get. Thus being in or out, or out or in, Where one care ends, another doth begin. I care to keepe me from the Serieants mace, Or from a barbrous Bayliffs rough embrace: Or from a Marshals man that mercy lacks, That liues a cursed life by poore mens wracks, From Serieants that are Saracens by kinde, From Bayliffs that are worse then Beares in minde: And from a Marshals monsters trap or snare, To keepe me from such knaues as those I care, A Pander (Hostler-like) that walks a whore, And for a fee, securely keeps the doore, A Punck that will with any body doe, And giue the pox in to the bargaine too: A rotten stinking Bawd, that for her crimes, Stewd in a sweat hath beene some fifteene times, A Drunkard, that delights to curse and sweare, To shun such company as those I care. I care to please and serue my Masters will, And he with care commands not what is ill. I care to haue them hang'd that carelesse be, Or false vnto so good a Lord as he. I care for all Religions that are hurld And scatter'd o'r the vniuersall world: I care to keepe that which is sound and sure, Which euer and for euer shall endure. I care t'auoyd all Sects and errors foule, That to confusion haue drawne many a soule. For be a man, a Heathen, Turke or Iew, With care his miserable state I rue, That he should haue sence, reason, life and lim, Yet will not know That God that gaue them him. And can a Christian thinke vpon these things, But it his heart with care and pitty wrings; That three parts of the world, the grace doth shun Of their Creator, and his sauing Sonne? And as the Christians few in number be, Yet how they in Religions disagree, Kings, subiects, parents, children much diuided, By hell misguided, and by Turks derided. And can a Christian thinke how these things are, But that his heart must be possest with Care? I would all Princes that doe Christ professe, And hope through him for endlesse happinesse, Their quarrels to each other to lay by, And ioyne against the common Enemy, Who like a tempest oftentimes hath come, Aduancing Mahomet in Christendome. If Christian Kings this way would all prepare, For such a glorious warre as this I care. And here (for mirths sake) some few lines are made In the behalfe of me, and of my trade: But honest Reader, be not angry tho They looke Some six or eight lines are old of mine own, but I haue much varied them. like verses I wrote long agoe, But they by many men were neuer seene, And therefore fit to publish them I weene. I that in quiet in the dayes of yore, Did get my liuing at the healthfull Oare. And with content did liue, and sweat and row, Where like the tyde, my purse did ebbe and flow, My fare was good, I thanke my bounteous Fares, And pleasure made me carelesse of my cares. The watry Element most plentifull, Supplide me daily with the Oare and Scull, And what the water yeelded, I with mirth, Did spend vpon the Element of earth, Vntill at last a strange Poetique veine, As strange a way possest my working braine: It chanc'd one euening, on a Reedy banke, The Muses sate together in a ranke: Whilst in my boat I did by water wander, Repeating lines of Hero and Leander, The Triple three tooke great delight in that, Call'd me a shore, and caus'd me sit and chat, And in the end, when all our talke was done, They gaue to me a draught of Helicon, Which prou'd to me a blessing and a curse, To fill my pate with verse, and empt my purse. By their poore gift I haue experience found, What's fit to be reprou'd, and what renownd: And that a Waterman a member is, Which neither King nor Common-wealth can misse, Yet we could well misse some that are too bad, If better in their roomes were to be had: But though abundance of them I could spare, Tis onely for the honest trade I care. Some say we carry whores and theeues. Tis true, I'l carry those that said so, for my due: Our boats like hackney horses, euery day, Will carry honest men and knaues, for pay: We haue examples for it most diuine, Shall Gods gifts be common to good and bad, and our boats be priuate onely to the good?The Sunne vpon both good and bad doth shine, Vpon the dunghill and vpon the Rose: Vpon Gods seruants and vpon his foes: The wind, the raine, the earth, all creatures still, Indifferently doe serue both good and ill. All tradesmen sell their ware continually, To whores, or knaues, or any that will buy. They ne'r examine people what they are: No more can we, when we transport a Fare. Sappho a Poetresse, a Lady fam'd, Did wed a Waterman was Phaon nam'd: Ægypt Kings (with Oares) as histories doe show, King Edgar to's Parliament did row. And when the waters all the world o'r-ran, Old Noah was the onely Waterman. I care what quantity of this same stuffe I write: I may doe much, or not enuffe: To end it therefore I will haue a Care, And shew the Watermans briefe The character of a Waterman. Character. First, though he be not of the female kinde, Yet he's most like vnto a Whore, I finde: For both, the more vnready that they be, Both are most ready for their trade, we see: The Watermen in shirts, and Whores in smocks, Both ship and fall to worke, t'increase their stocks. Besides, a Waterman is much ingratefull, (And yet is his ingratitude not hatefull) For vnder God) the Riuer Thames a Watermans best friend, whom he, delights to crosse. Thamesis, His chiefest friend, and best maintainer is, It feeds and fills him, giues him daily treasure, And he (to crosse that Friend) takes pains with pleasure. Mine own vnkindnes I haue oft exprest, For when I crost it most, it pleas'd me best. And as an Hypocrite speakes fairest when He most deceiues, so we poore Watermen, Goe backward when we doe goe forward still, And forward, we goe backward with good will. Thus looking one way, and another rowing, With forward backward, backward forward going, To get my liuing I haue thought it meet, Much like a Weauer with both hand and feet, Or like a Ropemaker, I in my trade Haue many hundred times run retrograde; But though the Ropemaker doe backward goe, Yet is his worke before his face, we know; And all the voyages I vndertake, My businesse still hath bin behind my backe. But (in a word) let things be as they are, Those whom I carry, to land safe, I care. When I doe stand my labour to apply, I neither vse to call, or yall, or cry, Or thrust, or shoue, or rake, or hale, or pull The Gentleman, or Gentleman-like Gull, A mayd, a wife, a widdow, or a trull. Be he the greatest swearer on the earth, Or the most dang'rous theefe that e'r had birth, Be he or they as bad, or worse, or worst, Then any that of God or man are curst: Yet (if it be their lots to be my fare) To carry them and land them well I care. For why? should I through carelesse negligence, Drowne but a Rascall by improuidence, In me it were an action most vntrue, For robbing of the hangman of his due. And be a veluet villaine ne'r so braue, A siluer, silken, or a sattin slaue: And that I know, and doe esteeme him so, Yet with great care his Rogueship will I row, Because I would not wrong the courteous Riuer, With the base corps of such a wicked liuer; I haue a care to looke about me round, That he may liue and hang, and not be drownd. I take great care how I might Cares auoyd, And to that end I haue my Cares imployd: For long agoe I doe remember that There was a Prouerb, Care will kill a Cat. And it is said, a Cat's a wondrous beast, And that she hath in her nine liues at least, And sure if any Cat this care could shun, It was the famous Cat of Whittington, For whom was giu'n a ship rich fraught with ware And for a lucky Pusse like that, I care. But if Care of such potent power be, To kill nine liues, it may kill one in me; And therefore it behoues me to beware, That though I care not to be kild with care, I care, and in my care take great delight, (When by a Watch I doe passe late at night) Such answers to the Constable to shape, As by good words I may the Counter scape. My serious Cares and Considerations. Tis said, the age of man is seuenty yeeres, If eighty, it is full of griefe and Cares, And if we of our time account should keepe, How halfe our liues we doe consume in sleepe, And for the waking halfe, account that too, How little seruice to our God we doe: For till seuen yeeres be past and gone away, We are vncapable to doe or pray. Our Strange Eloquence. Adolescency till our manly growth, We waste in vanity and tricks of youth, And as we trauell to our iournyes end, The more we liue, the more we doe offend. In sixty yeeres three thousand Sabbaths be, Which are some eight yeeres in account we see: But of those Sundayes let vs thinke agen, How little seruice God hath had of men, And to the holiest man it will appeare, About one hundred houres in a yeere. And so in threescore yeeres God hath not one, Wherein his seruice we attend vpon. And if that (lesse then one) t'account were brought, How many a nap, and many a wauering thought, And wandring fancies doe vs round beset, (That many times the text we doe forget?) Thinke but of this, and then the yeere before Must be abated halfe, or somewhat more. Thus many a Christian sixty yeeres hath trod The earth, and not six months hath seru'd his God. When we our liues vnequally thus share, In thinking of it, I am full of care. I care in all my actions so to liue, That no occasion of offence I giue To any man, with either pen or tongue, In name, or fame, or goods, to doe them wrong. For he's the greatest murderer aliue, That doth a man of his good name depriue With base calumnious slanders and false lies: Tis the worst villany of villanies, To blast a good mans name with scandals breath, Makes his dishonor long suruiue his death: For Infamie's a colour dyde in graine, Which scarce obliuion can wash out againe. As nothing's dearer then a mans good name, So nothing wounds more deeper then defame. Nature gaue man a paire of eares and eyes, And but one tongue, which certainely implies, That though our sight and hearing still is free, Yet must we not speake all we heare or see. Then he's a Viper that doth lyes, inuent, To worke thereby anothers detriment: 'Tis sinne to slander a notorious Knaue; But sinne and shame a good man to depraue; Thus good or bad, or whatsoe'r they are, To doe to neither of them wrong I care. I care to get good Bookes, and I take heed, And care what I doe either write or read: Though some through ignorance; &amp; some through spite, Haue said that I can neither read nor write. But though my lines no Scholership proclaime, Yet I at learning haue a kind of ayme. And I haue gatherd much good obseruations, From many humane and diuine translations. I was well entred (forty Winters since) As farre as possum in my Accidence; And reading but from possum to posset, There I was mir'd, and could no further get: Which when I thinke vpon (with mind deiected) I care to thinke how learning I neglected. The Poet Bookes that I haue read of Poesie. Quid, (or Ouid if you will) Being in English, much hath helpt my skill: And Homer too, and Uirgil I haue seene, And reading them, I haue much better'd beene. Godfrey of Bulloyne, well by Fairfax done, Du Bartas, that much loue hath rightly wonne: Old Chaucer, Sidney, Spencer, Daniel, Nash, I dip'd my finger where they vs'd to wash. As I haue read these Poets, I haue noted Much good, which in my memory is quoted. Part of the Bookes of History that I haue read.Of Histories I haue perusde some store, As no man of my function hath done more. The Golden legend, I did ouer tosse, And found the Gold mixt with a deale of drosse. I haue read Plutarchs Morals and his Liues, And like a Bee, suckt Hony from those Hiues. Iosephus of the Iewes, Knowles of the Turks, Marcus Aurelius, and Gueuara's works: Lloyd, Grimstone, Montaigne, and Suetonius, Agrippa, (whom some call Cornelius,) Graue Seneca, and Cambden, Purchas, Speed, Old Monumentall Fox, and Hollinshead: And that sole Booke of Bookes, which God hath giuen, (The blest eternall Testaments of heauen) That I haue read, and I with care confesse, My selfe vnworthy of such happinesse. And many more good Bookes I haue with care Lookt on their goods, and neuer stole their ware: For no booke to my hands could euer come, If it were but the Treatise of Tom Thumb, Or Scoggins Iests, or any simple play, Or monstrous newes came Trundling in my way: All these, and ten times more, some good, some bad, I haue from them much obseruation had. And so with care and study I haue writ These bookes, the issue of a barren wit. The most of them are verse, but I suppose, It is much ease to name them here in prose. The names of many of the bookes that I haue written. First, the Sculler. Vpon Coriat three merry bookes, calledOdcombs complaint, Coriats resurrection, and Laugh and be fat. The nipping or snipping of Abuses. Two mad things against Fenor. Taylors Vrania. The marriage of the Princesse. An Elegy on Prince Henry. Two bookes of all the Kings of England. Three weekes, three dayes, and three houres obseruations in Germany. Trauels to Scotland. Trauels to Prague in Bohemia. As Englishmans loue to Bohemia. The Bible in verse. The Booke of Martyrs in verse. The praise of Hempseed. A kicksy winsy. The great O Toole. Iacke a Lent. The praise of Beggery. Taylors Goose. Faire and foule weather. The life and death of the Virgin Mary. The Whip of Pride. And lastly (since the reigne of th' Emperour I was much beholding to this Emperors name to make vp the meeter. Otto) Was neuer seene the like of Taylors Motto. All these, and some which I haue quite forgot, With care (as is aforesaid) I haue wrote. I care how to conclude this carefull straine: In care I care how to get out againe. I care for food and lodging, fire and rayment, And (what I owe) I care to make good payment. But most of all I care, and will endeuer To liue so carefull, that I may liue euer. Thus without wronging any man a iot, I shew I haue what euery man hath not: My wants are such, that I forgiue them free, That would but steale the most of them from me. My cares are many, as I here expresse, Poore couzin Germans vnto carelesnesse. I haue a knowledge some men will read this, I want the knowledge how their liking is. I care in all that I herein haue pend, To please the good, and shew the bad to mend. And those that will not thus be satisfi'd, I haue a spirit that doth them deride. I flattry want, mens likings to obtaine, I care to loue those that loue me againe. Thus be mens iudgements steady or vnsteady To like my Booke, the care is tane already. The Prouerb sayes, that haste makes (often) waste, Then what is waste, impute it to my haste: This Booke was written (not that here I boast) Put houres together, in three dayes at most: And giue me but my breakfast, I'l maintaine, To write another e'r I eate againe, But well or ill, or howsoe'r tis pend, Lik't as you list, and so I make an END. ODCOMBS COMPLAINT: OR, CORIATS FVNERALL EPICEDIVM: OR DEATH-SONG, VPON HIS late-reported drowning. With his Epitaph in the Barmuda, and Vtopian tongues: And translated into English by Iohn Taylor. TO THE MIRROR OF TIME, THE MOST REFVLGENT, SPLENDIDIOVS, REFLECTING COVRT Animal, Don Archibald Armstrong: Great M. Comptroller, Commander, and Countermander of mirth , alacrity, sport, and ridiculous confabulations, in this Septentrionall, or Westerne Monarchie of Magna Britania: Your poore and daily Orator, Iohn Taylor, wisheth increase of your wisdome, in your owne person, and that your eminence and spirit may be infused into the bosoms of most mens heires, that esteeme more of Wealth, then of Wisdome. The Authour in his owne defence. If any where my lines doe fall out lame, I made them so, in merriment and game: For, be they wide, or side, or long, or short, All's one to me, I writ them but in sport; Yet I would haue the Reader thus much know, That when I lift my simple skill to show In poesie, I could both read and spell: I know my Dactils, and my Spondees well; My true proportion, and my equall measure, What accent must be short, and what at leasure, How to transpose my words from place to place, To giue my poesie the greater grace, Either in Pastorall or Comick straine, In Tragedy, or any other vaine, In nipping Satyrs, or in Epigrams, In Odes, in Elegies, or Anagrams, In eare-bewitching rare Hexameters, Or in Iämbicke, or Pentameters: I know these like a Sculler, not a Scholler, And therefore Poet, pray asswage your choller, If as a theefe in writing you enuy me, Before you iudge me, doe your worst and try me. I. T. TO THE GENTLEMEN READERS, THAT vnderstand A.B. from a Battledore. No sooner newes of Coriats death was com, But with the same, my Muse was strook? dom: For whilst he liued, he was my Muses subiect, Her onely life, and sense sole pleasing obiect. Odc?bian, Græcian, Latin, Great Thom Asse He being dead, what life hath she alasse. But yet I hope his death was false Report, Or else 'twas rumord to beget some sport: To try how his deare friends would take his death, And what rare Epicediums they would make, T' accompany his all-lamented Herse, In hobling, iobling, rumbling, tumbling verse, Some smooth, some harsh, some shorter, &amp; some long: As sweet Melodious as Madge Howlets song: But, when I saw that no man tooke in hand To make the world his worth to vnderstand, Then vp I bussled from Obliuions den, And of a Ganders quill I made a pen, With which I wrote this following worke of woe, (Not caring much if he be dead or no:) For, whilst his body did containe a life, The rarest wits were at continuall strife, Who should exceed each other in his glory, But none but I haue writ His Tragick story. If he be dead, then farewell he: if not, At his returne, his thankes shall be thy lot, Meane time, my Muse doth like an humble Pleader Intreat acceptance of the gentle Reader. Remaining yours euer, Iohn Taylor. A SAD, IOYFVLL, LAMENTABLE, DELIGHTFVLL, MERRY-GO-SORRY ELEGY OR FVNERALL POEM VPON the supposed death of the famous Cosmographicall Surueior, and Historiographicall Relator, M? Thomas Coriat of Odcomb. O for a rope of Onions from Saint Omers, And for the muse of golden tongued Homers, That I might write and weepe, and weep and write, Odcombian Coriats timelesse last good-night, O were my wit inspir'd with Scoggins vaine, Or that Will Summons ghost had seaz'd my braine: Or Tarlton, Lanum, Singer, Kempe and Pope, Or she that danc'r and tumbled on the rope, Or Tilting Archy, that so brauely ran Against Don Phebus knight, that wordy man. O all you crue, in side pi'd coloured garments, Assist me to the height of your preferments: And with your wits and spirits inspire my pate ful, That I in Coriats praise be not ingratefull. If euer age lamented losse of folly, If euer man had cause of Melancholly, Then now's the time to waile his ruthlesse wracke, And weepe in teares of Claret and of Sack. And now, according to my weake inuention, His wondrous worthles worthines I'l mention; Yet to describe him as he is, or was, The wit of Men or monsters would surpasse. His head was a large poudring tub of phrases, Wh?ce men would pick delites, as boys pick daises, O head no head, but block house of fierce wars, Where wit and learning were at dully lars, Who should possesse the Mansion of his pate: But at the last, to end this great debate Admired learning tooke his heads possession, And turnd his wit a wandring in progression. But Minyon Muse, hold, whither wilt thou goe? Thinkst thou his rare anatomy to shew? None borne a Christian, Turke, nor yet in Tartary, Can write each veyne, each sinew, and each artery. His eyes and eares like Broakers by extortion, Ingrost strange forraine manners and proportion, But what his eyes and eares did see or heare, His tongue or pen discharg'd the reckoning cleare. That sure I thinke, he well could proue by law, He vttered more then e'r he heard or saw. His tongue and hands haue truly paid their score, And freely spent what they receiu'd and more. But lord to see, how farre o'r-shot am I, To wade thus deepe in his Anatomy! What now he is, I'l lightly overpasse, I'l onely write in part, but what he was. That as Grim Death our pleasures thus hath crost, Tis good, because he's gon, to know what's lost. Hee was the Imp, whilst he on earth suruiu'd, From whom this west-worlds pastimes were deriu'd, He was in City, Country, field, &amp; Court, The Well of dry braind lests, and Pump of sport. He was the treasure-house of wrinckled laughter, Where melancholly moods are put to slaughter: And in a word, he was a man 'mongst many, That neuer yet was paralleld by any: Who now like him in spite of wind and weather Will weare one shiftlesse shirt 5. months together? Who now to doe his natiue country grace, Will for a Trophee execute his case? Who now will take the height of euery Gallowes? Or who'l describe the signe of euery Alchouse? Whether his Host were bigge, or short, or tall, And whether he did knock e'r he did call: The colour of his Host and Hostesse haire? What he bought cheap, &amp; what he paid for deare! For Veale or Mutton what he paid a ioynt? Where he sate down? and where he loos'd a poynt? Each Tower, each Turret, and each lofty steeple, Who now (like him) wil tel the vulgar people? Who now will set aworke so many writers, As he hath done in spite of his back-biters, With Panegericks, Anagrams, Acrosticks, T'emblazon him the chiefe among fantasticks? Alas, not one, not one aliue doth liue, That to the world can such contentment glue, Should Poets stretch their Muses on the racke, And study till their pericranions cracke. Should foot-back trotting Trauellers intend To match his trauels, all were to no end. Let Poets' write their best, and trotters run, They ne'r shall write nor run as he hath done. Bvt Neptune and great Æolus contending, 'Gainst one another all their forces bending, Which of them soon'st should rob the happy earth Of this rare man of men, this map of mirth. And like two enuious great ambitious Lords, They fell at deepe and dangerous discords; The sea-god with his three-tin'd angry Rod com, And swore by Styx, he would haue Tom of Odcomb. With that, sterne Eole blew a boystrous blast, And in his rage did gusts and tempests cast In showring vollyes at fierce Neptunes head: Who like a valiant Champion scorning dread, Gaue blow for blow with his commanding Mace, And spitting stormes in spitefull Eols face, That golden Titan hid his glistring ray, As fearing to behold this horrid fray. Cimerian darknesse curtain'd all the world, An Ebon Mantle o'r the Globe was hurld, The wallowing waues turmoild the restless ships, Like School-boies shuttlecocks that leaps &amp; skips, The Top-mast seemes to play with Phœbus nose, Strait downe toward Erebus amaine she goes; Blow wind, quoth Neptune, till thy entrails breake, Against my force, thy force shall be too weake. Then like two fooles at variance for a trifle, They split the ship, they enter and they rifle, Like cursed Law-wormes, enuious and cruell, Striuing to seaze the peerelesse matchlesse Iewell, Whilst Eole sought aboue the skies to crown him; Blue-bearded Neptune in his arms did drown him. The Wind-god sees the prize and battell lost, Blowes, stormes, and rages to be curb'd and crost, And vow'd to rowze great Neptune in his Court, And in his teeth his iniury retort: Then he commands retreat to all his forces; Who riding sundry waies on winged horses, Bigge Boreas to the freezing North went puffing, And slauering Auster, to the South went huffing, Eurus went East, and Zephyrus went West, And thus the warres of windes and seas did rest. And now dame Thetis in thy vasty womb, Is odde Odcombians Coriats timelesse Toomb, Where Nayads, Dryads, and sweet sea-nimphs tend And with their daily seruice do befriend him, There al-shap'd Proteus and shrill trumping Triton, him, And many more, which I can hardly write on, As if it were the thing they glory at, In seruile troopes they wait on Coriat, That though like hell, the sea were far more dark, as Yet these would guard his vnregarded carkasse. You Academick, Latine, Greeke Magisters, You off-springs of the three times treble Sisters, Write, study, teach, vntil your to?gs haue blisters. For, now the Haddocks, and the shifting Sharks, That feed on Coriat, will become great Clarks: The wri-mouth'd Place, &amp; mumping Whiting-mops, Wil in their mawes keep Greeke and Latine shops, The Pork-like Porpose, Thorn-back, and the State, Like studious Grecian Latinists will prate, And men with eating them, by inspiration, With these two to?gs, shall fill each barbarous Nation. Then though the Sea hath rudely him bereft vs; Yet, midst our woes, this onely comfort's left vs, That our posterities by eating fishes, Shall pick his wisdome out of diuers dishes; And then (no doubt) but thousands more will be As learned, or perhaps all as wise-men as he: But to conclude, affection makes me cry, Sorrow prouokes me sleep, griefe dries mine eye. [Epitaph in the Vtopian tongue.] The same in English, translated by Caleb Quishquash, an Utopian borne, and principall Secretary to the great Adelontado of Barmoodoes. Here lies the wonder of the English Nation, Inuolu'd in Neptunes brinish vasty maw: For fruitlesse trauell, and for strange relation, He past and repast all that e'r eye saw. Odcomb produc'd him; many Nations fed him, And worlds of Writers, through the world haue spred him. FINIS. CERTAINE SONNETS, IN PRAISE OF M? Thomas THE DECEASED; FASHIONED OF diuers stufts, as mockado, sustian, stand-further off, and Motly, all which the Author dedicates to the immortall memory of the famous Odcombian traueller. [Conglomerating Aiax, in a fogge] Conglomerating Aiax, in a fogge Constulted with Ixion for a tripe, At which Gargantua tooke an Irish bogge, And with the same gaue Sisiphus a stripe, That all the bumbast Forrests 'gan to swell, With Triple treble trouble and with ioy, That Lucifer kept holiday in hell, 'Cause Cupid would no more be cald a boy. Delucitating Flora's painted hide, Redeemes Arion from the hungry Wolfe, And with conglutinating haughty pride, Threw Pander in the damb'd Venetian gulfe, The Mediterrane mountaines laught and smil'd, And Libra wandred in the woods so wild. [Bright Cassia Fistula was wondrous sad] Bright Cassia Fistula was wondrous sad, To heare Zarzaparillas great mis-hap, And Coloquintida was raging mad, When Saxafrage was set in Rubarbs lap; Dame Lickorish was in a monstrous fume, Against the lushious Reasons of the sunne, And Trinidado smoake auoids the roome, Whil'st Gum-armoniack sweares she is vndone; Vnguentum album is so pale and wan, That Paracelsus plaister mournes in black. The Spanish Eleborus strongly can Make Lignum vita's hide with neezing crack: Lo, thus with vnguents, plaisters, oyles, and drugges, We coniure vp the fierce infernall bugges. [The head strong Torchlight of Cimerian waues] The head strong Torchlight of Cimerian waues, With fiery frozen wonder leaps and vaults: And on th' Atlantick Ocean cuts and shaues, Whilst thunder thwacking Ossa limps and halts, Robustious Ætna drownes the Artick Pole, And forked Vulcan hath forsooke his forge, Apollo'es piebald mare hath cast her fole, And Mulley Mahomet hath fild his gorge. Don Belzebub sits fleaing of his breech, And Marble Proteus dances, leaps and skips, Belerophon hath pend an excellent speech, And big-boand Boreas kist Auroraes lips; The Welkin rumbles; Argos-lies asleepe, And Tantalus hath slaine a flocke of sheepe. [When flounder-flapping Termagant was slaine] When flounder-flapping Termagant was slaine, The smug-fac'd Cerberus did howle and yell, And Polyphemus rid in Charles his Waine, Whilst Gorgons head rung great Alcides knell, The rip-rap-riffe-raffe, thwick thwack stout Baboon Gripes in his downy clutch the spungy Oake, And young Andromeda at night rings noone, Whilst Asdrubal at tick tack lost his cloake. Prometheus couering the Vmbranoes head, And Typhon tumbles through the solid Ayre: Proud Pegasus on Cheese and Garlick fed, And Proserpina went to Sturbidge faire. Pope Hildebrand bade Pluto home to supper, And Don Diegoes horse hath broke his crupper. [Dick Swash drew out his three-pil'd blunted blade] Dick Swash drew out his three-pil'd blunted blade, And slasht in twaine the equinoctiall line: Tom Thumb did through th' Arabian deserts wade, Where Castor and his brother Pollux shine, The threed-bare flap-Iacks of the westerne Iles, Exasperate the Marble Sithian Snow, Dame Venus traueld fifty thousand miles, To see the bounds of Nilus ebbe and flow. The Gormundizing Quagmires of the East, Ingurgitate the Eremanthean Bull: And rude rebounding Sagitarius Ceast To pipe Leualtoes to Gonzagaes Trull, The Adriaticke Polcats sate carousing, And hidebound Gogmagog his shirt was lowsing, Sweet Semi-circled Cynthia plaid at maw, The whilst Endimion ran the wild-goose chase. Great Bacchus with his Cros-bow kild a daw, And sullen Saturne smil'd with pleasant face. The nine-fold Bugbeares of the Caspian lake, Sate whistling Ebon horne-pipes to their Ducks, Madge-howlet straight for ioy her Girdle brake, And rugged Satyrs friskd like Stagges and Bucks. The vntam'd tumbling fifteene footed Goat, With promulgation of the Lesbian shores, Confronted Hydra in a sculler Boat, At which the mighty mountaine Taurus rores, Meane time great Sultan Soliman was borne, And Atlas blew his rustick rumbling horne. FINIS. THE EIGHTH VVONDER OF THE VVORLD: OR, CORJATS ESCAPE FROM HIS SVPPOSED DROWNING. DEDICATED To the Mighty, Magnificent, Potent, and Powerfull Knight, Sir Thomas Parsons, (alias) Pheander, (alias) Knight of the Sunne, Great Champion to Apollo, Palatine of Phœbus, Sword-bearer to Sol, Tilter to Tytan, Housekeeper to Hyperion, and heire apparant to the inuisible kingdome of the Fairies: your deuoted Votary, Iohn Taylor, wisheth your Worshits wisdomes Longitude, Latitude, Altitude, and Crassitude may increase aboue the Ridiculous multitude of the most eminent Stultorums of this latter age. To thee braue knight, who from the Delphi? god come I c?secrate these famous Acts of Odcomb: To thee alone, and vnto none but thee, For Patronage my toyling Muse doth flee, I gaue my drowning Coriat vnto Archy, And with his faire escape to thee now march I, Not doubting but thou wilt in kindnesse take These lines thus writ, for his, and thy deare sake. If thou in kindnesse wilt accept this taske, Hereafter I will better things vn-caske, And make the world thy worth to glory at, In greater measure then at Coriat. I'l mount thee vp in verse past Charles his Wain, I'l make the Moone Endimion to disdaine, I'l write in euer-during lines thy fame, As farre as Phœbus spreads his glorious flame. I'l make thee plucke sterne Saturne by the Chaps, And braue great Ioue amids his thunder-clappes. I'l cause thy praise t'eclipse the god of Armes, I'l make Dame Venus yeeld to loues alarmes. The nimble Mercury shall be thy foot-man, If thou wilt grace my lines, therfore looke too't man. But if to patronize me thou dost scorne, 'Twere better then, thou neuer hadst beene borne: For 'gainst disdaine my Muses onely sport is, To write with Gall, commixt with Aqua-fortis: And Vineger, and Salt, and Sublimatum, Which where it falls, wil scortch &amp; scald: probat?. Then as thou lou'st the Fairy Queene thine Aunt, Daine to vouchsafe this poore and triuiall graunt: Then I thy Poet will with low Subiection, Proceed to write Tom Coriats Resurrection. Yours euer, whose endeauour shall perseuer in your seruice, Iohn Taylor. The cause of the contention betwixt sir Thomas the Scholer, and Iohn the Sculler. A pamphlet printed was, The Sculler nam'd, Wherein Sir Thomas much my writing blam'd; Because an Epigram therin was written, In which he said, he was nipt, gald and bitten. He frets, he fumes, he rages and exclaimes, And vowes to rouze me from the Riuer Thames. Well, I to make him some amends for that, Did write a Booke was cald, Laugh and be fat: In which he said I wrong'd him ten times more, And made him madder then he was before. Then did he storme, and chase, and sweare, and ban, And to superiour powers amaine he ran, Where he obtaind Laugh and be fat's confusion, Who all were burnt, and made a hot conclusion. Then after that, when rumour had him drownd, (The newes whereof, my vexed Muse did wound) I writ a letter to th' Elizian coast, T'appease his angry wrong-incensed Ghost. The which my poore inuention then did call, Odcombs Complaint, or Coriats Funerall. But since true newes is come, he scap'd that danger, And through hot Sun-burnt Asia is a ranger: His raising from the dead I thought to write, To please my selfe, and giue my friends delight. The VVorlds eighth VVonder: OR, CORIATS REVIVING. Lo, I the man whose Muse did lately forage, Through winds &amp; seas with dreadlesse dantlesse corage, And to the life, in hodg-podg rime exprest, How Odcombs Coriat was great Neptunes ghest. How Thetis sweetly lull'd him in her lappe, And (as her darling) fed the Barne with pappe. How big-mouth'd Æol storm'd, and puft, and blew: And how both winds and Sea with all their crue Were pleas'd and displeas'd; tumbled, rag'd, and tost, The Gainers glad, and mad were they that lost. These tedious taskes my toyling Muse hath run, And what she did, for Coriats sake was dun. Shee hath transported him to Bossoms Inne, Where in a Basket he hath hanged bin: Shee hath inuolu'd him in the hungry deepe, In hope to leaue him in eternall sleepe: Yet hauing hang'd him first, and after drown'd him, My poore laborious Muse againe hath found him. For 'tis her duty still to wait and serue him, Although the Fates should hang, or drown, or sterue him. The fatall Sisters serue his turne so pat, That sure he hath more liues then hath a Cat. Alcides neuer past so many dangers As he hath done, amongst his friends, and strangers. He runs through all his actions with such ease, As Hogs eate Acorns, or as Pidgeons Pease, There's nothing in the world can him disgrace, Not being beaten in a lowzy case: Nor Trunks, nor Puncks, nor stocks, nor mocks, nor moes, Nor being made an Asse in Rime and Prose: Nor hanging, drowning, carting nor the blanket. These honours all are his, the gods be thanked. Bvt now me-thinkes, some curious itching eare Doth long some sportiue newes of him to heare. For being in the Ocean buried vnder, And now aliue againe, 'tis more then wonder: But how these wondrous wonders came to passe, I (as I can) will tell you how it was. VVhen first this mirrour 'mongst a world of Nations, (This great ingroser of strange obseruations) Was bound for Constantines braue noble City, Then he (who is Wit-all, or else all witty) Whose vigilancy lets no aduantage slip, Embarked was in a tall proued Ship Of London, the Samaritan she hight: Now note the fore cast of this famous wight: The Ship he onely for her name did chuse, In detestation of the faithlesse Iewes: For why, the Iewes and the Samaritans Did hate as Christians, Anti-Christians. Yet I suppose his spight to them did spring, For I thinke what, and now I'l name the thing: In his first fiue months strange perambulation, He was in danger of that peruerse Nation. For they by wrongfull force would haue surpriz'd him, T'excoriat Coriat, and t'haue Circumciz'd him. This dreadfull terrour of his Lady-ware, I gesse the cause the Iewes he hatred bare. How-euer was his intricate intent, In the Samaritan to Sea he went: And eare-abusing false intelligence Said, he was drown'd in Neptunes residence. Thus false report did make me much mistake: For which, a faire recanting mends I'l make. My grieued Muse hath euer since his drowning, Beene vext with sorrow, and continuall swowning: But now she's all attir'd with mirth and gladnesse, The Lye was good that made her sick with sadnesse. Know therefore, Readers, whatsoe'r you are: That this great Britaine braue Odcombyan star, Was tost on Neptunes rough remorcelesse waues, Where each man look'd fortimelesse brinish graues: For Eolus vnlock'd his vaulted Center, And 'gainst the Sea-god did in Armes aduenter, With winds vniayled came at vnawares, And greene-fac'd Neptune with defiance dares, With all his watry Regiments to fight, Or yeeld this matchles, worthles, wondrous knight. The great humidious Monarch tells him plaine, 'Twere best he iogd from his commanding Maine: And with his troupes of homelesse, rouing slaues Goe hide him in the earths imprison'd Caues, And not disturbe him in his Regall Throne, For he would keepe Tom Coriat, or else none. Then Eol 'gan his windy wrath to vent, And swore by Styx, that Neptune should repent This hauty high audacious insolence, Against his powerfull great magnificence. Then Triton sounded, the alarme was giuen, That from hells bottome, to the skirts of heauen, The repercussiue ecchoes of his sounding, With dreadfull relapse backe againe redounding. Then, then Robustious swolne cheek'd Boreas blasts, Teare, riue, and shiuer Tacklins, Sailes, and Masts: In totter'd fragments all in pieces shatter'd, Which here and there confusedly lay scatter'd. These hurly burly stormes and tempests tumbling, With dire amazing Thunder-thumping rumbling, The mounting billowes, like great mountaines rise, As if they meant to drowne the lofty skies. Then downe they fall to the Tartarian deepe, As if th'infernall Fiends they meant to steepe: That sure (I gesse) a greater gust was neuer, Since Iuno did Ænea's ruine endeauour. The Kingly Sea-god (to auoyd more harmes) Caught Coriat (the cause of these Alarmes) And so his boystrous windy foe depriu'd, And home thorow worlds of flouds amain he diu'd. But awefull Ioue to his Imperiall spheare, These grieuous garboyles chanced for to heare: And to his brother Neptune downe he sends The wing-heel'd Mercury, with these commends: To thee, thou watry great commanding Keasar, I come from heauens Maiesticke mighty Cæsar; Commanding thee by thy fraternall loue, That from thy Coasts thou presently remoue The man thou lately took'st, the worlds sole w?der, Or else he'l rouze thee with distracting Thunder: And therefore, as Ioues friendship thou dost tender, To safe arriuall see thou dost him render: Whilst May'es sonne his message thus did tell, A fury, like a Post-knight, came from hell: And from th'infernall King of blacke Auernus, These words he vtter'd (which doe much concern vs.) From Acheronticke, Phlegetonticke waues, Thy brother Pluto thus much friendship craues: Thou wilt send Coriat downe with him to raigne, And he'l send thee as good a thing againe. For Proserpina his illustrious Pheare, Of him, and his aduentures chanc'd to heare: Because a Gentleman-vsher she doth want, To haue him, Pluto begs thy friendly grant. The Marine Monarch answers, thus it is: You Nuntius from our brethren Ioue and Dis, Know, such a mortall is within my power, Imprison'd close, in Thetis siluer Bower, I did surprize him midst a thousand toyles Of warres, of iarres, of bloody banefull broyles: My high-borne brother Ioue hath hither sent, Commanding me that I incontinent Doe safely set this new-found man aland. And I from Pluto further vnderstand, That he would haue him to Cocitus Coast, Where he and Ceres daughter rules the roast. First therefore I in wisedome hold it best, To yeeld vnto the mighty Ioues request: And on the Grecian coast I'l safely place him, Where he may w?der where his fortunes trace him. These messengers thus answer'd, were dismist, And Neptune did to land his guest persist: But now all hell was in an expectation For Coriats comming, making preparation, The Stigian Ferri-man on Stixes shore, Did wait with diligence to waft him o'r, And hels three-headed Porter sweetly sung For ioy, that all the Coastes of Limbo rung With howling Musickes, dambe despightfull notes, From out his triple Chaps, and treble throats. Ixion from the tortring wheele was eas'd, And pining Tantall was with iunkets pleas'd: And further, 'twas commanded, and decreed, The Gripe no more on Titius guts should feed. The nine and forty wenches, water filling, In tubs vnbottom'd, which was euer spilling: They all had leaue to leaue their endlesse toyles, To dance, sing, sport, and to keepe reuell coyles. Three forked Hocate to mirth was prone, And Sisiphus gaue o'r the restlesse stone. All, in conclusion, had free leaue to play, And for Tom Coriats sake make holiday. Thus all blacke Barathrum is fill'd with games, With lasting bone-fires, casting sulphur-flames. In Vse'rers skuls the molten gold they quaffe, And skink, and drink, and wink, and stink, and laffe. But when the Post was come and told his Tale, Then all this sport was turn'd to banefull bale. Grim Pluto storm'd, and Proserpina mournd, And tortur'd Ghosts, to torments were returnd. The Sea-god (carefull of great Ioues high hest) To great Constantinople brought his guest: Where (nothing that may honour him omitting) His entertainement to his state was fitting: There in all pleasure he himselfe disports, Conuersing daily with such braue consorts, As Turkes, and Tartars, Englishmen and Greekes, That he thinkes ages yeeres, and yeeres but weekes, That's wasted in this rare time stealing chat, All his delight's in nothing else but that. But his high honour further to relate, I'l sing the new aduancement of his state. Some English Gentlemen with him consulted, And he as nat'rally with them constulted: Where they perceiuing his deserts were great, They striu'd to mount him into honours seat: And being found of an vnmatched spright, He there was double dub'd a doughty Knight. Rise vp, sir Thomas, worship'd mayst thou be Of people all (that are as wise as thee.) Now rap't with ioy, my Muse must needs record, How he was knighted with a royall sword: But into what a puzzell now got I am? They say it was the Bilbo of King Priam, The fatall blade which he in fury drew, When in reuenge the Mirmidons he slew. Impell mel vengeance for great Hectors bane, Who by Achillis faire foule-play was slaine. That sword that mow'd the Grecians like a sithe: That sword that made victorious Troyans blithe: That sword, that through so many dangers rub'd, That famous sword hath Monsier Coriat dub'd. What though 'twas rusty? spight of cankerd rust, The memory of honour liues in dust, 'Twas no disgrace it was so rusty shap'd, It had (like Coriat) many a scowring scap'd. Bvt 'mongst the rest, this must not be forgot, How he did from Constantinople trot, And how a solemne counsell there decreed, That he should trauell in a Grecian weede. To this (for his owne safety) they doe woo him, Because the language is so nat'rall to him. And then bespake a sober sage wise fellow, (When wine had made them all in general mellow) Take heed, quoth he, I counsell you, beware That of your selfe you haue a speciall care, You be not taken for a French-man, for The Turks in these parts doe the French abhor, Since Godfries times, that braue bold Bullen Duke, Who put them all to shame, and rough rebuke, And made the Sarasins by Millions bleed, And holy Toombe, from faithlesse fiends he freed. Wherefore (quoth he) in friendship I aduise you T'auoid suspect, 'twere best we Circumcise you: And then you freely may through perils passe, Despight the Turks, so like a Grecian Asse, No man with Linxes eyes will deeme you other, And thus you safely may suspition smother. Sir Thomas gaue this fellowes speech the hearing, But told him 'twas too heauy for his bearing: For why, fall backe, fall edge, come good, come ill, He vow'd to keepe his fore-mans fore-skin still. This resolution was no sooner spoken, The friendly counsell was dismist and broken. Where after leaue was tane twixt him and them, He tooke his iourny toward Ierusalem: And what he can obserue 'twixt morne and night, With due obseruance he doth daily write, That if my iudgement be not much mistooke, An Elephant will scarce support his booke. For he in fiue months built a paper hulke, And this must be ten times of greater bulke. O Pauls-Church-yard, I onely pitty thee, Thou, onely thou, shalt most encumbred bee: Thou from the Presse art prest to be opprest, With many a farfetch'd home-brought Odcomb iest. But yet I know tht Stationers are wise, And well do know wherein the danger lies: For to such inconuenience they'l not enter, But suffer Coriat to abide th'aduenter: Because his Gyant volume is so large, They'l giue sir Thomas leaue to beare the charge. That man is mad who changes gold for drosse, And so were they to buy a certaine losse: Let him that got and bore the Barne, still breed it, And nurse, disburse, and foster, cloath, and feed it. Thus hath my Muse (as fortune her allotted) Both run and rid, and gallopt, ambled, trotted To skyes, and seas, and to blacke hell below. In seruile duty that my loue doth owe. My captiue thoughts, like trusty seruants to him, Striue how they any way may seruice doe him. To serue his turne like Prentices they gree, Ioue send Sir Thomas home to make them free. Epilogue to Sir Thomas Coriat vpon his name. VVhy haue I spent my time thus, Coriat? Wherfore on thy leud lines thus pore I at? Why like an Ideot foole adore—I at Thy workes? which wisedome will not glory at. At no place euer was before—I at Where wonders vpon wonder more—I at With pen, in stead of Lance, now gore—I at Thy Odcomb foppery now bore—I at. At thy prides altitude, now sore—I at Thou art the Theame I write my—story at. If ought befell me to be—sory at Hard-hearted fate, 'gainst thee then rore—I at. Vpon his bookes name, called his Crudities. Tom Coriat, I haue seene thy Crudities, And, me-thinkes, very strangely brude it is, With piece and patch together glude—it is, And how (like thee) ill-fauour'd hu'de—it is, In many a line I see that lewd—it is, And therefore fit to be subdew'd—it is. Within thy broyling braine-pan stude—it is, And twixt thy grinding iawes well chewd—it is, Within thy stomacke closely mude—it is; And last, in Court and Country spude—it is: But now by wisedomes eye that view'd it is, They all agree that very rude—it is. With foolery so full endude—it is, That wondrously by fooles pursude—it is, As sweet as galls amaritude—it is, And seeming full of Pulchritude—it is: But more to write, but to intrude—it is, And therefore wisedome to conclude—it is, A Simile for his Learning. The lushious Grape of Bacchus heating Vine, When it to ripe maturity is sprung, Is prest, and so conuerted into wine, Then clos'd in Caske most tight at head and bung: For if by chance, it chanceth to take vent: It spils the wine in colour, strength, and sent, Eu'n so thy Latine, and thy Greeke was good Till in thy musty Hogges-head it was put: And Odly there Commixed with thy blood, Not wisely kept, nor well, nor tightly shut: That of the Caske it tastes, so I assure thee, That few (or none) can (but in sport) endure thee. My Fare-well to him. Now Coriat, I with thee haue euer done, My Muse vnto her iournies end hath wonne: My first Inuentions highly did displease thee, And these my last are written to appease thee. I wrought these great Herculean works to win thee: Then if they please thee not, the foole's within thee: What next I write, shall better be or none, Doe thou let me, and I'l let thee alone. But if thou seem'st to rub a galled sore, Vindictas vengeance makes all Hell to rore. FINIS. Laugh, and be Fat: OR, A COMMENTARY VPON THE ODCOMBYAN BANKET. LAVGH, AND BE FAT. Now Monsieur Coriat, let them laugh that wins, For I assure ye now the game begins. 'Tis wondrous strange how your opinions vary, From iudgement, sence, or reason so contrary; That with infamous rash timerity. You raile at me with such seuerity, The broad-fac'd Iests that other men put on you, You take for fauours well bestow'd vpon you. In sport they giue you many a pleasant cuffe, Yet no mans lines but mine, you take in snuffe. Which makes the ancient Prouerbe be in force, That some may with more safety steale a horse, Then others may looke on: for still it falls. The weakest alwayes must goe to the walls. I need not vse this Etymology, My plainer meaning to exemplifie; Which doth induce me to expresse the cause, That my vntutor'd Pen to writing drawes. Be it to all men by these presents knowne, That lately to the world was plainely showne, In a huge volume Gogmagoticall, In Verse and Prose, with speech dogmaticall, Thy wondrous Trauels from thy natiue home, How Odly out thou went'st and Odly Come. And how, as fitted best thy Workes of worth, The rarest Wits thy Booke did vsher forth. But I alas, to make thy same more fuller, Did lately write a Pamphlet call'd the Souller: In which, as vnto others of my friends, I sent to thee (braue Monsieur) kind commends, Which thou in double dudgeon tak'st from me, And vow'st, and swor'st, thou wilt reuenged be. The cause, I heare, your fury flameth from, I said, I was no dunce-combe, cox-combe Tom: What's that to you (good Sir) that you should fume, Or rage, or chafe, or thinke I durst presume To speake, or write, that you are such a one? I onely said, that I my selfe was none. Yet Sir, I'l be a Cocks-combe if so please you, If you are ouer-laden, Sir, I'l ease you, Your store of witlesse wisdome in your budget, To giue your friend a little neuer grudge it. Nor that from Odcombs towne I first began, Nor that I Greeke or Latine gabble can. I am no Odcombe Tom, why, what of that? Nor nothing but bare English can I chat. I pray what wrong is this to you good Sur? Your indignation why should this incurre? Nor that I thought our Land had spent her store, That I need visit Venice for a whore; Which (if I would) I could make neerer proofes, And not (like you) so farre to gall my hoofes. I said, If such a volume I should make, The rarest wits would scorne such paines to take, At my returne, amidst my skarre-crow totters, To runne before me like so many trotters. I know, my merits neuer will be such, That they should deigne to honour me so much. I further said, I enuied not your state, For you had nothing worthy of my hate. In loue, your innocence I truly pitty, Your plentious want of wit seemes wondrous wittie. Your vertue cannot breed my hatefull lothing, For what an asse were I, to hate iust nothing Your vice I hate not, neither, I protest, But loue, and laugh, and like it like the rest. Your vice, nor vertue, manners, nor your forme, Can breed in me fell enuies hatefull worme. I said it was a lodging most vnfit, Within an idle braine to house your wit. Here, I confesse, my fault I cannot hide, You were not idle, nor well occupide. Be't faire, or foule, be't early, or be't late, Your simple wit lies in your humble pate. A King sometimes may in a cottage lye. And Lyons rest in swines contagious stye: So your rare wit that's euer at the full, Lyes in the caue of your rotundious skull, Vntill your wisedomes pleasure send it forth, From East to West, from South vnto the North, With squib-crack lightning, empty hogshead thundring, To maze the world with terror &amp; with wondring, I boldly bade you foole it at the Court, There's no place else so fit for your resort. But though I bid you foole it, you may chuse, Though I command, yet Sir. you may refuse; For why, I thinke it more then foolish pitty, So great a iemme as you, should grace the citty, Whilst I would foole it on the liquid Thames, Still praying for the Maiesty of Iames. Good Sir, if this you take in such disgrace, To giue you satisfaction, take my place, And foole it on the Thames, whilst I at Court Will try, if I, like you, can make some sport: Or rather then for fooleship we will brawle, You shall be foole in Court, on Thames and all. Thus what to you I writ, loe here's the totall, And you with angry spleen haue deign'd to note all; And vow from hell to hale sterne Nemesis, To whip me from the bounds of Thamesis: Yet when I ope your paper murd'ring booke, I see what paines the wisest wits haue tooke, To giue you titles supernodicall, In orders orderlesse methodicall: There doe I see how euery one doth striue In spight of Death, to make thee still suruiue. No garded gowne-man dead, nor yet aliue, But they make thee their great superlatiue. In the beginning Alphabeticall, With figures, tropes, and words patheticall, They all successiuely from A to N, Describe thee for the onely man of Men. The frontispice of Master Coriats Booke very learnedly descanted vpon, by Master Laurence Whitakers, and Master Beniamin Ionson. Thy Shipping, and thy Haddocks friendly feeding, Thy Carting in thy Trauels great proceeding: Thy riding Stirroplesse, thy iadish courser, Thy Ambling o'r the Alpes; and which is worser, After the Purgatory of thy Legges, Thy Puncke bepelts thy pate with rotten egges. When thou, braue man, assault'st to boord a Pinace, As fits thy state, she welcomes thee to Venice. Thy running from the mis-beleeuing Iew, Because thou thought'st the Iew sought more then due; For why, the Iew with superstition blind, Would haue thee leaue what most thou lou'st, behind. How with a rusticke Boore thou mad'st a fray, And manfully broughtst all the blowes away. The Turkish Emp'rour, or the Persian Sophy, Can hardly match thy monumentall Trophy. Thy ancient Ierkin, and thy aged sloppes, From whose warme confines thy retainers drops. I stand in feare to doe thy greatnesse wrong, For 'tis suppos'd thou wast a thousand strong; Who all deriu'd from thee their happy breeding, And from thy bounty had their clothes &amp; feeding. Thy lasting shooes, thy stockings, and thy garters, To thy great fame are drawn and hangd in quarters. Thy Hat most fitly beautifies thy crest, Thy wits great couer, couers all the rest. The letter K doth shew the brauest sight: But wherefore K? I'm sure thou art no Knight: Why might not L, nor M, nor N, or O, As well as knauish K, thy picture show? But saucie K, I see will haue a place, When all the Crosse-row shall endure disgrace. Who at the letter K doth truly seeke, Shall see thee hemm'd with Latine &amp; with Greeke: Whereas thy name, thy age, and Odcombs towne, Are workemanly ingrau'd to thy renowne. Beleaguerd round with three such female shapes, Whose features would enforce the gods to rapes, France, Germany, and smug-fac'd Italy, Attend thee in a kind triplicity. France giues thee clusters of the fruitfull vine, And Germany (layes out) t'adorne thy shrine: And Italie doth wittily inuite thee, And prittily (she sayes) she will delight thee. But yet thy entertainement was but bitter, At Bergamo with horses in their litter: Whose iadish kindnesse in thy stomacke stickes, Who for thy welcome flung thee coltish kickes. Thy begging from the high-way Purse-takers, Describes thee for a learned wiseakers. Lo thus thy single worth is praised double, For rare inuention neuer counts it trouble, With rimelesse reasons, and with Reasons verse, Thy great Odcombian glory to rehearse. But yet, whilst they in pleasures lap doe lull thee, Amidst thy praise egregiously they gull thee: Th'art made Tom Table-talke, mongst gulls and gallants, Thy book, and thee, &amp; such esteemed tallants, When they are tired with thy trauels treading, Then hauing nought to do, they fall to reading. Thy wits false-galloping perambulation, Which ease the Readers more then a purgation. But to proceed, I'l recapitulate The praise that doth thy worth accommodate. Thy Character in learn'd admired Prose, The perfect inside of thy humour showes: Attended with thy copious names Acrosticke, To shew thee wisest being most fantasticke. All these Noblemen and Gentlemen that are named in this following book, did write merry commendatory verses, which were called the Odcombian banquet, and were inserted in M? Coriats booke, intituled, Coriats Crudities: Vpon which verses, I haue seuerally and particularly paraphrased. Next which, in doggrell rime is writ, I wot, Thy name, thy birth, and place where thou wast got: Thy education, manners, and thy learning, Thy going outward, and thy home returning. Yet there I finde, the Writer hath tane leaue, Midst words that seeme thy fame aloft to heaue, That for no little foole he doth account thee, But with the greatest vp aloft doth mount thee. Th'art lik'ned to a Ducke, a Drake, a Beare, A iadish Gelding that was made to beare: An Owle that sings, no wit, to whit, to who, That nothing well can sing, nor say, nor doe. Incipit Henricus Neuill de Aberguenie. Then follows next, a friend that faine would knight thee, But that he fears he should do more then right thee: Yet wh? his verses praise on cock-horse heues thee, He found thee Thomas, &amp; Thom as he leaues thee. Iohannes Harrington de Bathe. The Goose that guarded Rome with sensles gagling, Is here implor'd t'assist the Ganders stragling: A pen made of her quill would lift thee soone, As high as is the thorn-bush in the Moone. Incipit Ludouicus Lewknor. Fooles past and present and to come, they say, To thee in generall must all giue way: Apuleius asse, nor Mida's lolling eares, No fellowship with thee (braue Coriat) beares, For 'tis concluded 'mongst the wizards all, To make thee Master of Gul-finches hall. Incipit Henricus Goodyer. Old Odcombs odnesse makes not thee vneuen, Nor carelesly set all at six and seuen. Thy person's odde, vnparaleld, vnmatchd, But yet thy Action's to the person patch'd. Thy body and thy mind are twins in sadnesse, Which makes thee euen in the midst of odnesse. What-e'r thou odly dost, is eu'nly meant, In Idiotisme thou art eu'n an Innocent. Thy booke and thee are shap'd so like each other, That if I looke on t'one, I see the tother, Th'art light, th'art heauy, merry midst thy sadnesse And still art wisest midst of all thy madnesse. So odly euen thy feet thy iourney trod, That in conclusion thou art euenly odde. Incipit o Ihannes Paiton Iunior. Thou saw'st so many cities, townes, and garisons, That Cæsar must not make with thee comparisons: Great Iulius Commentaries lies and rots, As good for nothing but stoppe mustard pots. For Coriats booke is onely in request, All other volumes now may lye and rest. Blind Homer in his writings tooke great paines, Yet he and thee doe differ many graines: For in my minde I hold it most vnfit, To liken Homers verses to thy Writ. Incipit Henricus Poole. Next followes one, whose lines aloft doe raise Don Coriat, chiefe Diego of our daies. To praise thy booke, or thee, he knowes not whether, It makes him study to praise both, or neither. At last, he learnedly lets flie at large, Compares thy booke vnto a Westerne Barge; And saies, 'tis pitty thy all worthlesse worke, In darke obscurity at home should lurke; And then thy blunted courage to encourage, Couragiously he counsels thee to forrage 'Mongst forraine Regions, and t'obserue their state, That to thy Country-men thou might'st relate At thy returne, their manners, liues, and law, Belcht from the tumbrell of thy gorged maw. Incipit Robertus Philips. This worthy man thy fame on high doth heaue, Yet Mounsieur Leg-stretcher, pray giue me leaue. He saies that men doe much mistake thy age, That thinke thou art not past the making sage. Tis hard to make a foole of one that's wise; For wit doth pitty folly, not despise: But for to make a wise man of a foole, To such a Clarke we both may goe to schoole. Yet much I feare, to learne it is too late, Our youthfull age, with wit is out of date. He sayes, If any one a foole dares call thee, Let not his thundring big-mouth'd words apall thee; But in thine owne defence draw out thy toole, Thy Booke, he means, which will his courage coole. For why, thy Booke shall like a brazen shield Defend thy cause, and thee the glory yeeld. An asse I'm sure, could ne'r obserue so much, Because an asses businesse is not such. Yet if an asse could write as well as run, He then perhaps, might doe as thou hast gone. But tis impossible a simple creature Should doe such things (like thee) aboue his nature. Thou Aiax of the frothie Whitson Ale, Let Æolus breathe, with many a friendly gale, Fill full thy sailes, that after-times may know, What thou to these our times dost friendly show: That as of thee the like was neuer heard, They crowne thee with a Marrot, or a Mard. Incipit Dudleius Digges. Here's one affirmes thy booke is onely thine, How basely thou didst steale nor yet purloyne, But from the labour of thy legges and braine, This heire of thine did life and soule obtaine. Thou art no cuckold, men may iustly gather: Because the childe is made so like the father, In nat'rall fashion, and in nat'rall wit: Despight of Art, 'tis Nat'rall euery whit. Incipit Rowlandus Cotton. Columbus, Magelan, nor dreadfull Drake, These three, like thee, did neuer iourny take. Thou vntir'd trauelling admired iemme, No man that's wise will liken thee to them. The Calfe, thy booke, may call thee sire and dam, Thy body is the Dad, thy minde the Mam. Thy toylesome carkasse got this child of worth, Which thy elaborate wit produced forth. Now Ioues sweet benison befall the Barne, How quickly it the fathers wit could learne! So thou nor male nor female art by right, But both in one, a true Hermaphrodite. That man may well be call'd an idle mome, That mocks the Cocke because he weares a combe: A man to better vse may put his tongue, Then flowt an Asse because his eares be long. To thee alone in Tropes sophisticall, These lines are writ in speeches mysticall. The Moones own man that bears the bush of thorn, May rue the time, that e'r thy selfe wast borne; Thou hast beene, whereas he hath neuer beene, And seene more sights then Luna's man hath seene: Cast lots with him, for why, I thinke it fit, Thou hadst his bush to shrowd thy nat'rall wit. Tis pitty Calculations of thy birth, Should be diuulg'd about this massie earth; For out of it each foole would matter pike, By Obseruation to beget thy like. Incipit Robertus Yaxley. Now Mounsieur Coriat, enuy not the Sculler, Here's one would haue thy coat of many a culler, And as befits thy person, he thinks best, Thou had'st a cap and Cocks-combe for thy crest. And 'cause a traueller may boldly lye, A whetstone Embleme-wise must hang thereby. And at the last he ends in pleasant sort, And saies, Thy booke and thee, were made for sport. Incipit Iohannes Strangwaies. This Gentleman thy trauels doth aduance, Aboue Kemps Norwich anticke Morris-dance: And hauing grac'd thy fame with praises meet, Talkes of thy shooes, and of thy galled feet, And how thou thought'st the Iewes were too too cruel, And ranst away from them, to saue thy iewel. Thy heeles there help'd thee nimbly in thy flight, Since which, thy hands haue done much more to wright. Incipit Gulielmus Clauel. Here's one whose Muse was coniur'd from her sleep And being rapt with admiration deepe, Thy booke he titles Gogmogog the huge, Thy shield of safety, and thy wits refuge. Iohannes Scorie. Here's one that mounts thy fame beneath the sky, And makes thee famous for Cosmography. He saies, (but sure he either iests or flouts) Thou drew'st a Map, when first thou pist thy clouts. And how it was allotted thee by fate, As soone as thou wast borne, to talke and prate. For as a candles stuft with cotton weeke, So thou art cramm'd vp to the brim with Greeke. To Asia and to Affricke, prethee goe, Let them like Europe thy rare vertues know, And make thy Booke thy Buckler 'gainst all euill, Whose grim aspect will terrifie the diuell. Iohannes Donne. Another here thy Booke doth much commend, That none can studie it to any end. Without or head, or foot, or top or taile; Yet like a sauage monster dares assaile The front of sadnesse, who with anticke grinning, Applauds thee without ending or beginning. Great Lunaticke, I thinke thou'lt ne'r be full, Vntill the world cannot containe thy skull: And like a foot-ball cram the vaulty skies, Because, earth, aire, nor sea cannot suffice The greatnesse of thy Fame, thy booke and thee, All three in one, and one compact of three. Yet here's a Prophecie concernes thee much, Which doth thy booke and thee too neerely tutch; Both gulls, and gallants, thy poore brat bereaues, And from thy booke, shall rend both lims &amp; leaues, To wrap vp pepper, ginger, cloues and mace, And drie Tobacco in each skuruie place: To fold vp drugs, and pilles, for Physicks vse, And serue for each Mechanicall abuse. But I not minding with thy state to flatter, Thinke 'twill be vs'd in many a priuie matter. Thou o'r thy wit dost keepe such carefull watch, That from thee one can hardly any catch: And sooth to say, his conscience is but little, Which in his wants would seeke to rob the Spittle. Thy wits exchequer hath bin ouer-kinde, That (much I feare) there's little left behinde. But thou (braue man) bidst freely farewell it, We'll raise Fifteenes, and Subsidies of wit Shall fill thy seruiceable pate againe, Whose p?drous waight shal tire thy bearing brain. Then feare not, man, but spend it whilst thou hast it, To doe thy Countrey seruice 'tis not wasted. This Author saies, thy book o'r-throwes him quite, And therefore bids both it and thee good night, The greatnesse of it puts him in such feares, That he'll reade neither all, nor none, he sweares. Richardus Martin. This friend of thine, thy wisedome cannot mocke, Yet he intitles thee an Od comb'd cocke: 'Thad bin all one, if at thy comming home, He had but plac'd the cocke before the combe. To make thy name more learnedly appeare, He calls thee here an Od comb'd Chanticleere. I know not who this should bee, but it is the next English to M? Laurence Whitakers Out-landish. Now here's another like a true Attourney, Pleades very wisely, and applauds thy iourney: And saies, thy trauels thou didst so decipher, As well the world may see thou art no cipher. And how thy booke so liuely out doth show thee, That whosoe'r doth see't, must truly know thee. Hugo Holland. This man doth praise thy totterd ragged shirt, Thy shooes and shanks at all he hath a flirt: And like a patient bearing Asse, he saies, Thou bear'st thy load through faire &amp; foulest waies. And for in carriage thou didst proue so able, At night thou laist with Iades within a stable. Thou wast not onely in thy pace an asse, But thou all other asses didst surpasse. All beasts in knowledge were to thee but weake. For thou the tongue of Balaams asse didst speake. But much I feare, thy booke in print will staine, Because thou art not di'd a (?) in graine. The Preamble to the Paralel, and the Epilogue. Againe, this Author thinkes it no great slander, To say thou fitly maist be call'd a Gander. Braue trotting traueller, thy fame he hisses, And makes thy wit inferiour to Vlisses. And if he laugh not at thee, much he feares, In angry spleene thou'lt haue him by the cares. Therefore hee'l laugh at thee, and so will I, In hope to scape thy furious rage thereby. Next, in the ancient famous Cambrian tongue, To call thee noddy, he accounts no wrong. T'interpret this, I need to goe to Schoole, I wot not what he meanes, except a (?). Robertus Riccomontanus. A large relation this thy friend did write, Describing thee a monstrous man of might: And bids thee venter such another taske, And at thy backe returne hee'll haue a caske, Much bigger then the Heidelbergian bumbard, To keepe thy works, that neuer can be numberd. Christopherus Brooke Eboracensis. This Gentleman in some vnmeasur'd measure, Compares thee vnto Homer and to Cæsar. Old Homers Iliads are but idle tales, Waigh'd with thy works, thy booke will turne the cales. And like great Cæsar he doth thee commend, For thou, like him, hast all thy trauels penn'd, But yet, me thinks he playes the merry foxe, And in thy praises writes a Paradoxe. Iohannes Hoskins, Cabalisticall, or Horse verse. Hold, holla, holla, weehee, stand, I say, Here's one with horse-verse doth thy praise dissplay: Without all sence, or reason, forme, or hue, He kicks and flings, and winces thee thy due. He maketh shift in speeches mysticall, To write strange verses Cabalisticall; Much like thy booke and thee, in wit, and shape, Whilst I in imitation am his Ape. Mount Maluorn swimming on a big-limb'd gnat, And Titan tilting with a flaming Swanne, Great Atlas flying on a winged Sprat, Arm'd with the Hemispheares huge warming pan. Or like the triple Vrchins of the Ash, That lie and flie through Morpheus sweet-fac'd doore, Doth drowne the starres with a Poledauies flash, And make the smooth-heel'd ambling rocks to rore: Euen so this tall Colombrum Pigmy steeple, That bores the Butterflie aboue the spheare; Puls Æolus taile, and Neptunes mountaines tipple. Whilst Coloquintida his fame shall reare. Loe thus my Muse, in stumbling iadish verse, On horse-backe and on foot thy praise rehearse. Pricksong. Here's one harmoniously thy fame doth raise, With Pricksong verse to giue thee prick &amp; praise: But prick nor spur can make thee mend thy trot, For thou by nature art nor cold nor hot: But a meere nat'rall, neutrall amongst men, Arm'd like the bristles of a Porcupen. If French, or Venice Puncks had fir'd or scald thee, This man had neuer raw-bon'd Coriat call'd thee: Thou that so many Climats hotly coasted, I wonder much thou wast not boild nor rosted. Yet euery man that earst thy carkasse saw, Are much in doubt if thou bee'st roast or raw, Iohannes Pawlet, de George Henton. Now here's another in thy praises ran, And would intitle thee the great god Pan. No warming-pan thou art I plainely see, No fire-pan, nor no frying-pan canst thou be. Thou art no creame-pan neither, worthy man, Although thy wits lie in thy heads braine-pan. Lionel Cranfield. This Gentleman thy wondrous trauels rips, And nothing that may honour thee, he skips. Thy yron memory thy booke did write, I prethee keepe a wench to keepe it bright; For cankerd rust, I know will yron fret, And make thee wit and memory forget. Lest rust therefore, thy memory should deuoure, I'd haue thee hire a Tinker it to scowre. Iohannes Sutclin. Now here's a friend doth to thy fame confesse, Thy wit were greater if thy worke were lesse. He from thy labour treats thee to giue o're, And then thy ease and wit will be much more. Lo thus thy small wit, and thy labour great, He summons to a peaceable retreat. Inigo Iones. What liuing wight can in thy praise be dum, Thou crowing Cock, that didst from Odcom come. This Gentleman amongst the rest doth flocke, To sing thy fame, thou famous Odcomb'd cocke. And learnedly, to doe thee greater grace, Relates how thou canst scrue thy veriuyce face. He wishes him that scornes thy booke to read, If at the Sessions house he chance to plead, That he may want his booke, although he craue; But yet, thy booke will sooner hang then saue. So many gallowses are in thy booke, Which none can read without a hanging looke. Georgius Siddenham. Now here's a Substantiue stands by himselfe, And makes thee famous for an anticke elfe: But yet, me thinkes, he giues thee but a frumpe, In telling how thou kist a wenches rumpe: To spoile her ruffe, I thinke thou stood'st in feare, That was the cause that made thee kisse her there. Robertus Halswell. Thy praise and worth this man accounts not small, But 'thad bin greater, writing not at all: Thy booke he calls Dame Admirations brother, I thinke the world vnworthy such another. Thy booke can make men merry that are sad, But such another sure will make men mad. Iohannes Gifford. This friend amongst the rest, takes little paine, To laud the issue of thy teeming braine: And to applaud thee with his best endeauor, He begs his wits to helpe him now or neuer. He bids graue Munster reuerence thy renowne, And lay his pen aside, and combe thy crowne. He praises thee, as though he meant to split all: And saies, thou art all wit (but yet no witall) Except thy head, which like a skonce or fort, Is barracado'd strong, lest wits resort, Within thy braines should rayse an insurrection, And so captiue thy head to wits subiection. Robertus Corbet. The luggage of thy wit, thy Booke he tearmes, The bagge and baggage of thy legs and armes, That neuer can be vnderstood by none, But onely such as are like thee alone. Iohannes Donnes. This Gentleman commends thy Trauels much, Because like thee, was neuer any such. Decembers thunder, nor hot Iulies snow, Are nothing like the wonders thou dost show. Iohannes Chapman. Here's one in kindnesse learnedly compacts, Thy naturall iests, and thy all naturall acts, And craues the Reader would some pity take, To buy thy booke, euen for his owne deare sake. For of thy trauels, and thy great designes, There's little matter writ in many lines. Thou in much writing tak'st such grear delight, That if men read, thou car'st not what thou write. This man could well afford to praise thee more, But that hee's loth to haue thee on his score: For he no longer will thy praise pursue, Lest he should pay thee more then is his due. Iohannes Owen. This Author (to thy fame) in friendship saies, How ancient Writers pend the Asses praise: And wishes some of them aliue agen, That they alone might thy high praises pen. Petrus Alley. Now here's a friend that lowd thy glory rings, With Cannons, Sakers, Culuerings, and Slings, Guns, drums, and phifes, and the shrill clang'rous tr?pet Applauds thy courting the Venetian str?pet Samuel Page. This Gentleman accounts it no great wrong, Amidst thy praise, to say thy eares be long: His meaning my construction much surpasses, I wot not what he meanes, except an (?.) Thomas Momford. Here's a strange riddle puts me much in doubt, Thy head's within thy wit, thy wit's without: 'Twere good some friend of thine would take the paines To put thy wit i'the inside of thy braines. For pitty doe not turne it out of dore, Thy head will hold it, if'twere ten times more. Thomas Bastard. This Gentleman aduiseth thee take heed, Lest on thy praise too greedily thou feed: But though, too much, a surfet breed he saies, Yet thou shalt surfet, but not die of praise. Guilielmus Baker. Here's one by no meanes at thy fame can winke, And saies, how most men say thou pissest inke: If it be true, I'de giue my guilded raper, That to thy inke thou couldst sir-reuerence paper: Thy gaines would be much more, thy charges lesse, When any workes of thine come to the Presse. 'Twere good thy eares were par'd from off thy head, 'Twould stand Cosmographers in wondrous stead, To make a Globe to serue this massie earth, To be a mappe of laughter, and of mirth. All new-found sustian phrases thou do'st sup, And 'gainst a dearth of words, dost hoard them vp. Yet where thou com'st, thou spendst thy prating pelfe, Thogh no man vnderstand thee, nor thy selfe. Thou art in a iewell to be hang'd most fit, In eares, whose heads are nothing, but all wit. And thy blown tongue wil make great ships to saile From coast to coast, if winde and weather faile. Againe. Againe his Muse from sodaine sleep is waked, And saies, this booke of thine is nat'rall naked. Thou surely art a seruiceable waiter, For when thou mad'st this booke, thou didst not loyter. Yet much he doubts, if God or fiend will haue thee, For if thou be'st sau'd, sure thy booke will saue thee. If I to scape the gallowes needs must read, I surely for another booke will plead: The reason that incites me thereunto, Thy booke to saue thee hath enough to doe. This man hath a Greeke name. This Gentleman thy praise doth briefely note, Compares thy wit and senses to a Goate, And well thy breeding he hath here exprest, A Phœnix hatch'd from out the Wag-tailes nest. But let them say, and call thee what they will, Thou wast, and art, and wilt be Coriat still. Thomas Farnabie, alias Baiurafe. Here's one that like a carefull true Collector, Tells, like a Bee, thou fill'st thy combe with Nectar: Die when thou wilt, in honour of thy Name, Ram-headed Bel-weathers shall ring thy fame. Guilielmus Austin. I thinke this Author doth equiuocate, In writing of the word Assassinate. The word so prittily he feemes to curtall, That I imagine it is done for sportall. But he perswades thee, trauell once agen, And make the world to surfet with thy pen. Glareanus Uadeanus. Thou fatall impe to Glastenburie Abby, The Prophecie includes thou art no baby, That ouer Odcombs towne must one day ferrie, As Whiting earst did ouer Glastenberie. But yet 'tis pitty one of thy rare skill, Should like the Monke be drownd vpon a hill. If thou canst climbe to heauen in hempen string, Thy fame for euer then my Muse shall sing: But yet 'tis safer in a Trunke to hide, Then such a dang'rous wincing iade to ride. Iohannes Iackeson. Thou that hast trauel'd much from coast to coast, Come eat this Egge, that is nor rawe nor rost: For like a friend, this man hath plaid the cooke, And potch'd this Ginnie Egge into thy booke. Michael Draiton. Now here's another followes with a messe, In haste, before thy Booke comes to the Presse. The shortnesse of the time, is all his fault: But now he's come, and brings thee spoons &amp; salt. He saies that thou hast taught the right behauior, How with great men we all may liue in fauor. He bids thee liue, and with their loues to ioyne, Whose worth and vertues are most like to thine. Nicholas Smith. This Author liuely hath thy fame exprest, But yet his lines are different from the rest: For all but he that doe thy praises pen, Say thou art farre vnlike to other men. But this man to thy honour doth relate, How many Courtiers thee doe imitate: And how for feare thou should'st be stolne away, They make themselues as like thee as they may. For if they lose thee by false theft, or slaughter, The Court (I feare) will weep for want of laughter. Thy greatnes here the pore-blind world may see, He saies (not I) thy peeres haue iudged thee: Stand to their censures then, make no deniall, For surely thou hast had a noble triall. Laurentius Ensley. Here's one commends thy booke, and bodies paine, And counsels thee to trauell once againe; Whereas the treasure of thy wit and body, Shall tire each lumpish asse, and dronish noddie. A horse that beares thy corpes, more ease shall find, Then men can haue in bearing of thy minde: For in thy minde is many a paire of gallowes, Waigh's more then thee, or twentie of thy fellowes. Was nothing in thy iourney, small or mickle, But in thy minde thou barrell'dst it in pickle: So that if men to see thy minde were able, There's more confusion then was ere at Babel. For there's confusion both of tongues and towers, Of loftie steeples, and of lowly bowers. Of Iibbets, racks, and round tormenting wheeles, Of Haddockes, Paddockes, and of slipp'rie Eeles: Of wit, of sense, of reason, death, and life, Of loue, of hate, of concord, and of strife. The seuen deadly sinnes, and liberall Arts, Doe in thy minde discord and haue tane parts. It is a doubt which side the conquest winnes, Either the liberall Arts, or deadly sinnes. Not fourtie Elephants can beare the loade, Of pondrous things, that haue in thee abode. Thy minde waighs more then I can write or speak, Which heauie burden Atlas backe would breake. Iohannes Dauis. This Gentleman thy trauels doth relate, Applauding much the hardnesse of thy pate: I thinke thy head's as hard as steele, or rockes, How could thy cox-comb else endure such knocks? The brauest Smithes of Britaine haue tane paines, To beat vpon the anuill of thy braines. But let them beat, thou canst abide the blowes, Thou countst th? fauors which thy friends bestows, One with a cocks-combe hits thee o'r the comb, Another with an Asses eares strikes home: Another with a fooles coat, and a cap, As hard as he can driue, giues thee a clap: But let them strike with what they please to strike, Thy hardened head will not their strokes dislike. The blows the Boore did giue thee in the vineyard, Thou put'st them vp, &amp; neuer drew'st thy whiniard: Thou took'st a beating from a boorish foe-man, I hope that thou wilt scorne a knocke from no man. Richardus Badley. Here's one whose lines c?mend thee with the most, And saies, how that a foole at Pentecost, (At Whitsontide he meanes) did ouerthrow thee, And at thy owne blunt weapon ouer-crow thee. If it be true, me thinkes 'tis wondrous strange, That thou so many countries o'r should'st range: And hast the tongues of Latine and of Greeke, Yet 'gainst a foole should'st haue thy wits to seeke. I at the Sessions house the like haue seene, When malefactors at the bar haue beene, Being well-read Schollers, for their booke would plead, Yet for their liues haue had no power to read. So thou great Polypragmon wast more graueld With this wise foole, th? else-wher as thou traueld. Henricus Peacham. Of all rare sights, in city, court, or towne, This Author saies, thou brauely put'st them downe; The horrid darke eclipse of Sunne or Moone, The Lyon, Elephant, or the Baboone: The huge Whale-bone, that's hang'd vp at Whitehall, The sight of thee puts downe the diuell and all. Tricks, Iigges, and motions, are but idle toyes, The sight of thee their glories all destroyes. The sweetnesse of thy Phisnomy is such, That many to behold it would giue much. But they are blind, and would giue more to see, And therefore would giue much to looke on thee. The Vtopian Tongue. Thoytom Asse Coria Tushrump codsheadirustie, Mungrellimo whish whap ragge dicete tottrie, Mangelusquem verminets nipsem barely bittimsore Culliandolt trauellerebumque, graiphone trutchmore. Pusse per mew (Odcomb) gul abelgik foppery shig shag Cock a peps Comb sottishamp, Idioshte momulus tag rag. Iacobus Field. This Author 'mongst the rest in kindnesse comes To grace thy trauels with a world of Toms: Tom Thumbe, Tom foole, Tom piper, and Tom-asse, Thou Tom of Toms dost all these Toms surpasse. Tom tell-troth is a foolish gull to thee, There's no comparisons twixt thee and hee. If tell-troth Tom were any of thy kin, I thinke thy Booke not halfe so big had bin. Clareanus Videanus. Not last, nor least, but neere thy praises end, This worthy man thy worthlesse works commend: No scuruy idle name he will thee call, And therefore he will call thee none, but all. If I on euery Epithete should write, Thy friends bestow on thee, thou wandring wight, No Reader then durst on my writings looke, They would so far out-swell thy boystrous booke. But shortest writ, the greatest wit affoords, And greatest wit, consists in fewest words. Thus Monsieur Coriat, at your kind request, My recantation here I haue exprest, And in my Commentaries haue bin bold To write of all that haue your fame inrol'd, I meane of such, my wit can vnderstand, That speake the language of the Britaine land. But for the Latine, French, the Greeke, or Spanish, Italian, or the Welsh, from them I vanish. I on these tongues by no meanes can comment, For they are out of my dull Element. Consider with your selfe, good Sir, I pray, Who hath bin bolder with you, I, or they? If I, I vow to make you satisfaction, Either in words, or pen, or manly action: I haue bin bold to descant on each iest, Yet from the Text I nothing wrong did wrest: My lines may be compared to the Thames, Whose gliding current, and whose glassie streames, On which if men doe looke, as in a glasse, They may perceiue an asse to be an asse, An owle an owle, a man to be a man: And thou, thou famous great Odcombian, Shalt see thy selfe descypherd out so plaine, Thou shalt haue cause to thanke me for my paine. But holla, holla, whither runnes my pen? I yet haue descanted what other men Haue wrote before: but now I thinke it fit To adde additions of mine owne to it. I yet haue champ'd what better writers chaw'd, And now my Muse incites me to applaud Thy worth, thy fortune, and thy high desart, That all the world may take thee Asse thou art. And now to sing thy glory I begin, Thy worthy welcome vnto Bossoms Inne. M? Coriats entertainement at Bossoms Inne. Iewes-trumps &amp; Bag-pipes, musick high and low, Stretch to the height your merry squeking notes And all you Cockney cocks clap wings and crow, Here comes an Odcomb cocke will eat no oates. Pipes, tabers, fiddles, trebble, and the base, Blow, sound, and scrape, fill all the ayre with mirth: Blind harpers all your instruments vncase, And welcome home the wonder of the earth: Great Coriat, mirrour of the foure-fold world, The fountaine whence Alacrity doth flow, On whom rich Nature nat'rall gifts hath hurld, Whom all admire, from Palace to the Plow: The onely Aristarck-asse of this age, The maine Exchequer of all mad-cap glee; For Fortune thrust him on this earthly stage, That he the onely Thing of Things should be. He that so many galling steps hath trac'd, That in so many countries earst hath bin, And to his euiternall fame is grac'd, To be well welcom'd vnto Bossoms Inne. Vnto which place, whilst Christmas time doth last If any once in progresse chance to come, They of my Lords great bounty needs must taste, Which oftentimes doth proue a pondrous summe. For why, my lusty liberall minded Lord Is very friendly to all passengers, And from his bounty freely doth afford Both pounds, and purses to all messengers. And thither now is Monsieur Odcombe come, Who on his owne backe-side receiud his pay; Not like the entertainement of Iacke Drum, Who was best welcome when he went his way. But he not taking my Lords coyne for current, Against his Lordship and his followers raues, Like to a cruell all-deuouring torrent, These words he vtterd stuff'd with th?dring braues: Base vassals of the blacke infernall den, Vntutor'd peasants to the fiends of hell, Damn'd Incubusses in the shapes of men, Whose mind's the sinke where impious dealings dwell; Curst age, when buzzards, owles, and blinded bats, Against the princely Eagle rise in swarmes, When weazels, polecats, hungry rau'ning rats, Against the Lyon raise rebellious armes, When as the offall of the vilest earth, Raile roguishly 'gainst their superiour powers, And seeme to contradict them in their mirth, And blast with stinking breath their pleas?t houres, When base mechanicke, muddy-minded slaues, Whose choysest food is garlicke and greene cheese, The cursed off-spring of hells horrid caues, Rude rugged rascals, clad in pelt and freeze. And such are you you damn'd Tartarian whelps, Vnmanner'd mungrels, sonnes of Cerberus, Whom Pluto keepes for speedy hellish helps, T'increase the monarchie of Erebus. But now my Muse with wrinkled laughter fild, Is like to burst: O hold my sides, I pray, For straight my Lord by his command'ment wild, ('Cause Corsat did his Lordship disobay) That in the Basket presently they mount him, And let him see his ancient royall tower: For he hath maz'd them all, that they account him To be some mighty man, of forcelesse power: And now the matter plainer to disclose, A little while I'll turne my verse to prose. 2. Oration. No sooner was this graue Oration ended, Whereto my Lord, and all his traine attended, Being strooken in an admirable maze, That they like Ghosts on one another gaze: Quoth one, This man doth coniure sure, I thinke, No quoth another, He is much in drinke: Nay quoth a third, I doubt he's raging mad, Faith, quoth my Lord, he's a most dangerous lad: For such strange English from his tongue doth slide, As no man (but himselfe) can speake beside. If those that with their damnable intent, Intended to blowe vp the Parlament, Had had but him, and halfe a dozen such, In gun-powder 'twould sure haue sau'd th? much, For why their t?gs with blown c?bustious words, Had done more scath then gunpowder or swords. But let him hang vntill his clam'rous tongue Vntwist with smoother garbe this sawcie wrong. Yet I imagine some strange secret worke, Did in his hanging in the Basket lurke. What greater fame could to his glorie rise, Then with a rope to trauell t'ward the skies: And there to doe his carkasse greatest grace, Among the gods to giue him Momus place: For Saturne, Iupiter, and Phaetons Dad, Are all enamor'd on this louely lad. Mars, Venus, and the tel-tale Mercurie, Doe all desire Tom Coriats company. And Luna, sure shee's quite besides her wits, Still wauering, changing, with fantasticke fits: T'is thought shee neuer will come to her selfe, Till shee possesse this worthy worthlesse elfe. For he's the man that Nature makes her casket, To mount the skies in triumph in a basket. But out alas my Muse, where hast thou bin? I should haue kept my selfe at Bosomes Inne. And see how I haue scal'd the spungie clowds. But tis his worth my meditations crowds To this extrauagant impertinence, As being rauisht with his eminence. But blame me not: for hee's the gigge of time, Wh? sharpest wits haue whipt with sportfull rime And some would wear their sharp-edg'd Muses bl?t, If in his praise they longer time should hunt. But here's my comfort, I am not alone, That vnder this most pondrous burden groane. There's some like me, haue in his laud bin bizzie: But I haue made my pericranion dizzie, To sing the worth of this all wordy squire, Whom sea and land, and fish and flesh admire. And now his contemplation prompts his tong, To tune his voyce to a more milder song. His tongue that brake the peace, must peace procure: That (like Achilles launce) can wound and cure. And once more, Reader, humbly I entreat, That I in spowting Prose may now repeat His Oratories smooth-fac'd Epilogue. O for some Academicke Pedagogue T'instruct my braine, and helpe my art-lesse quill, To mount his fame past Gads, or Shooters hill. Epilogue to M? Coriat. Thus to the Ocean of thy boundlesse fame, I consecrate these rude vnpolish'd lines, To thee whose Muse can men and monsters tame, Whose wit the vault of wisdome vndermines. Whose poudered phrases with combustions flame, Like Glo-wormes in the darkest darke doe shine. To them in all Sir reuerence, I submit, Thou mir'd admired Capcase, cramd with wit. FINIS. MASTER THOMAS CORIAT TO HIS FRIENDS IN ENGLAND SENDS GREETING, From Agra, the Capitall City of the Dominion of the Great MOGOLL in the Easterne India. Printed according to the true Copie of the Letter written with his owne hand in the Persian paper, and sent home in the good Ship called the Globe, belonging to the Company of East India Merchants: With an addition of 200. Verses written by I. T. that like a Gentleman Vsher goes bare before his pragmaticall Prose, in commendation of his Trauels. [Some may perhaps suppose this Prose is mine] Some may perhaps suppose this Prose is mine, But all that know thee, will be sworne 'tis thine: For (as 'twas said b'a learned Cambridge Scholler) (Who knows the stile, may smel it by the Coller:) The Prose (I sweare) is Coriats, he did make it, And who dares claime it from him, let him take it. Certaine Verses in commendations of this mirrour of footmanship, this Catholique or vniuersall Traueller, this European, Asian, African Pilgrime, this well letterd, well litterd discouerer and Cosmographicall describer Master Thomas Coriat of Odcombe. O thou, whose sharpe toes cut the Globe in quarters, Mongst Iews &amp; Greeks &amp; tyrannizing Tartars: Whose glory through the vasty Welkin rumbles, And whose great Acts more then nine Muses mumbles, Whose rattling Fame Apollo's daughters thunders, Midst Africk monsters, and mongst Asian wonders; Accept these footed Uerses I implore thee, That here (Great Footman) goe on foot before thee: To sing thy praise I would my Muse inforce, But that (alas) she is both harsh and hoarse: And therefore pardon this my Loues Epistle, For though she cannot sing, I'l make her whistle. IN PRAISE OF THE AVTHOR MASTER Thomas Coriat. Thou that the world with pleasures ful hast pleasur'd, And out of measure many kingdomes measur'd. Whilst men (like swine) doe in their vices wallow, And not one dares for's eares thy steps to follow; Not one within the Compasse of the Cope, Like thee that dares suruay the Horoscope: For who is he that dares call it a lye, That thou hast trotted into Italie? By th'edge of France, and skirts of Spaine th'ast rambled; Through Belgia &amp; through Germany th'ast ambled. And Denmarke, Sweden, Norway, Austria, Pruce, Poland, Hungary, Musconia, With Thracia, and the land of merry Greekes, All these and more applaud thee, that who seekes Vpon the top of Mount Olympus front, Perhaps may see thy name insculp'd vpon't, And he that durst detract thy worth in Europe, I wish he may be hang'd vp in a new rope. It were a world of businesse to repeat Thy walkes through both the Asiaes, lesse &amp; great, Whereas (no doubt) but thou hast tane suruay Of China and the kingdome of Catay, Th'East Indies, Persia, Parthia, Media, Armenia, and the great Ass-yria, Caldea, Iurie, (if we not mistake vs) Thou hast o'r-look'd the Sea call'd Mortuus Lacus. And I durst venter somewhat for a wager, Thou hast seene Ionia, Lidia, Misia Maior, Old Iliums Ruins, and the wracks of Priam, But of Inuention I (alas) so dry am, I beat my braines and with outragious thumping, My lines fall from my pen with extreme pumping. Auaunt, dull Morpheus, with thy leaden spirit, Can matter want of him that wants no merit? As he through Syria and Arabia's coasting, My lines from Asia into Africke poasting, I'l follow him alongst the Riuer Nilus, In Egypt, where false Crocodiles beguile vs. Through Mauritania to the towne of Dido, That slew her selfe by power of god Cupido. The Kingdomes vnsuruaid he'l not leaue one From Zona Foride, to the Frozen Zone. With Prester Iohn in Æthiopia, And th'ayrie Empire of Eutopia. A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE LONGING desire that America hath to entertaine this vnmatchable Perambulator. America, A merry K, Peru, Vnhappy all in hauing not thy view: Virginia of thy worth doth onely heare, And longs the weight of thy foot-steps to beare: Returne thee, O returne thee quickly than, And see the mighty Court of Powhatan; Then shall great Volumes with thy Trauels swell, And Fame ring lowder then Saint Pulchers Bell. Then maist thou (if thou please) despight the Deuil, End thy good daies within the Towne of Euill. And then at Odcombe thou entomb'd maist be, Where Trauellers may come thy shrine to see, By which the Sexton may more money get, Then Mecaes Priests doe gaine by Mahomet. These Letters following, which thou didst subscribe Vnto thy Mother and th'Odcombian Tribe, Declare thy Art, and also whence thou art, And whence, from thence thy purpose is to part. Thy learn'd Oration to the mighty Mogull, All men thereby may see if thou beest no gull, Tis so compactly and exactly writ, It shewes an extraordinary wit. For write thou what thou please, ('tis thy good lot) Men like it, though they vnderstand it not. A LITTLE REMEMBRANCE OF HIS VARIETY OF TONGVES, AND Politicke forme of Trauell. A very Babel of confused Tongues, Vnto thy little Microcosme belongs, That to what place soeuer thou doest walke, Thou wilt lose nothing through the want of talke. For thou canst kisse thy hand, and make a legge, And wisely canst in any language begge: And sure to beg 'tis policy (I note) It sometimes saues the cutting of thy throat: For the worst thiefe that euer liu'd by stealth, Will neuer kill a begger for his wealth. But who is't but thy wisedome doth admire, That doth vnto such high conceits aspire? Thou tak'st the bounty of each bounteous giuer, And drink'st the liquor of the running riuer: Each Kitchin where thou com'st, thou hast a Cook, Thou neuer runst on score vnto the Brooke; For if thou didst, the Brook and thou wouldst gree, Thou runst from it, and it doth run from thee. In thy returne from Agra and Assmere, By thy relation following doth appeare, That thou dost purpose learnedly to fling A rare Oration to the Persian King. Then let the idle world prate this, and that, The Persian King will giue thee (God knows what.) And furthermore to me it wondrous strange is, How thou dost meane to see the Riuer Ganges, With Tigris, Euphrates, and Nimrods Babel, And the vnhappy place where Cain slew Abel. That if thou wert in Hebrew circumcised, The Rabbyes all were wondrous ill aduised; Nay more, they were all Coxcombs, all stark mad, To thinke thou wert of any Tribe but Gad. Sure, in thy youth thou at'st much running fare, As Trotters, Neates-feet, and the swift-foot Hare, And so by inspiration fed, it bred Two going feet to beare one running head. Thou filst the Printers Presse with griefe &amp; mourning, Still gaping, and expecting thy returning: All Pauls Church-yard is fild with melancholly, Not for the want of bookes, or wit; but folly It is for them, to greeue too much for thee, For thou wilt come when thou thy time shalt see. But yet at one thing much my Muse doth muse, Thou dost so many commendations vse Vnto thy mother, and to diuers friends, Thou hast remembred many kind commends, And till the last, thou didst forget thy Father, I know not why, but this conceit I gather, That as men sitting at a feast to eat, Begin with Beefe, Porke, Mutton, and such meat, And when their stomacks are a little cloyd, This first course then the Voyder doth auoyd: The anger of their hunger being past, The Pheasant and the Partridge comes at last. This (I imagine) in thy minde did fall, To note thy Father last to close vp all. First to thy Mother here thou dost commend, And astly to thy Father thou dost send: Shee may command in thee a Filiall awe, But he is but thy Father by the Law. To heare of thee, mirth euery heart doth cheere, But we should laugh out-right to haue thee heere. For who is it that knowes thee but would chuse, Farther to haue thy presence then thy newes. Thou shew'st how wel thou setst thy wits to work, In tickling of a misbeleeuing Turke: He call'd thee Giaur, but thou so well didst answer (Being hot and fierie, like to crabbed Caucer) That if he had a Turke of ten pence bin, Thou toldst him plaine the errors he was in; His Alkaron, his Moskyes are whim-whams, False bug-beare bables, fables all that dams, Slights of the Diuell, that bring perpetuall woe, Thou wast not mealy mouth'd to tell him so, And when thy talke with him thou didst giue ore, As wise he parted as he was before: His ignorance had not the power to see Which way, or how to edifie by thee: But with the Turke (thus much I build vpon) If words could haue done good, it had beene done. The Author of the Verse, takes leaue of the Author of the Prose, desiring rather to see him, then to beare from him. Those Rimes before thy meaning doth vnclose, Which men perhaps haue bl?dred ore in Prose: And 'tis a doubt to me, whose paines is more, Thou that didst write, or they that read them o're: My Scullers muse without or Art or Skill, In humble seruice (with a Gooses quill) Hath tane this needlesse, fruitlesse paines for thee, Not knowing when thoul't doe as much for me. But this is not the first, nor shall not be The last (I hope) that I shall write for thee: For wh? newes thou wast drown'd, did hither come, I wrote a mournefull Epicedium. And after, when I heard it was a lye, I wrote of thy suruiuing presently. Laugh and be tat, the Scullers booke, and this Shew how my minde to thee addicted is; My loue to thee hath euermore beene such, That in thy praise I ne'r can write too much: And much I long to see thee here againe, That I may welcome thee in such a straine That shall euen cracke my pulsiue pia mater, In warbling thy renowne by land and water: Then shall the Fame which thou hast won on foot, (Mongst Heath?s, Iews, Turks, Negroes black as foot) Ride on my best Inuention like an asse, To the amazement of each Owliglasse. Till when fare well (if thou canst get good fare) Content's a feast, although the feast be bare. Let Eolus and Neptune be combinde, With Sea auspicious, and officious winde; In thy returne with speed to blow thee backe, That we may laugh, lie downe, and mourne in Sacke. Iohn Taylor. [A BAWD.] DEDICATED TO THE NEITHER NOBLE OR JGNOBLE, LORD OR LADY, KIND, OR CRVELL, learned or ignorant, curteous or currish, Christian or Barbarian, Man or Woman, rich or poore: but to all and euery one in generall and particular. [A Bawd. A vertuous Bawd, a modest Bawd: ] A Bawd. A vertuous Bawd, a modest Bawd: As Shee Deserues, reproue, or else applaud. A Bavvd. My Verse is honest, seemely, neat, and cleane, Yet is my Theame polluted and obsceane: Ile touch foule pitch, yet will not be defilde, My Muse shall wade through dirt, and not be soild. The Sun on noysome Dunghils shines as well, As on faire flowers that doe fragrant smell: The Ayre by which wee liue, doth euery where Breathe still alike vpon the poore and Peere. The Sea beares many an old despised VVitnesse my paper Boat. Boat, Yet on the Sea the best ships doe but float, And Earth allowes to all her scatterd brood, Food, Clothes and lodging, to the bad and good. Yet Sun, Ayre, Sea, nor Earth receiue disgrace By any bounty which they giue the base. Euen so my Muse, (free from all foule intents) Doth take example from the Elements, In laying better studies by a while, And in cleane fashion write a beastly stile: Yet will I not my sense or meaning marre, With tearmes obscure, or phrases fetcht from farre, Nor will I any way equiuocate, With words sophisticall, or intricate, Utopian-Fustianisme, poore heathen Greeke, To put my Readers wits to groape and seeke. Small eloquence men must expect from me, My Schollership will name things as they be. I thinke it good, plaine English, without fraud, To call a Spade a Spade, a Bawd a Bawd. Two little Pamphlets I haue wrote before, Which I was bold to call a Thiefe, and Whore, Yet was my Whore so chaste, that shee had not, From end to end, one foule offensiue spot, Nor did my Thiefe from any man purloyne, Or liu'd by filching either goods or coyne. And now by chance it came into my mind, That with the Bawd my pen was much behind: My Whore was honest, and my Thiefe was true, And in this sort Ile giue the Bawd her due. Strange fruit from my poore barren labours springs, I modestly must vse immodest things, 'Tis somewhat hard, but yet it is no riddle, All Bawdry doth not breed below the middle. So many seuerall sorts of Bawdes doe grow, That where theres not a Bawd, 'tis hard to know. The first with spirituall Bawdes, whose honour high. Springs from the whoredome of Idolatry. Cast but your eyes vpon the Man of Rome, That stiles himselfe the head of Christendome, Christs vniuersall Uicar, and Vicegerent, In whom fooles thinke the Truth is so inherent. That he can soules to Heauen or hell preferre, And being full of Errours, cannot erre: And though his witchcraft thousands hath entic'd, He will be call'd Lieutenant vnto Christ. How hath that false Conuenticle of Trent, Made lawes, which God, or good men neuer meant, Commanding worshipping of stones and stockes, Of Reliques, dead mens bones, and senslesse blocks, From which adultrate painted Adoration, Men (worse then stocks or blockes) must seeke saluation? The Soules of men are His that dearly bought them, And he the onely way to Heauen hath taught them. And whoso forceth them to false adoring, Is the maine Bawd, vnto this Spirituall Whoring. Besides, it is apparent, and most cleere, That hee's the greatest Bawd the Earth doth beare: For he that tolerates the Stewes erection, Allowes them Priuiledges and protection, Shares in the profit of their sordid sweat, Reapes yeerely Pensions and Reuennues great, Permits the Pole-shorne Fry of Fryers and Monks, For Annuall stipends to enioy their Punckes. When Hen. Smith in his treat. of Herodot. Cap. 38. page 303. Paul the third the Romish miter wore, He had contributary Truls such store, To fiue and forty thousand they amount, As then Romes Register gaue true account. Besides, it was approu'd, the gaine was cleere Cornelius Agrippa in his vanity of Sciences.Full twenty thousand Duckats euery yeere. Moreouer, once a Bishop (boasting) said, He had Ten Thousand Priests that paid (Some more, some lesse) by way of Rent or fines, Each Idem. one of them for keeping Concubines. And he that keepes none, payes as much as he As for his vse doth keepe one, two, or three. All's one, the Priests must pay t'augm?t the treasure, Keepe or not keepe, Whore or not Whore at Pleasure. Now iudge, good Reader, haue I said amisse, Was euer any Bawdry like to this? Pope Lucrece was first married to her own brother the son of Pope Alexander the sixt, shee being daughter to the said Pope, and daughter in law to him by the marriage with his sonne. And being concubine to the said Pope, hee caused her after his sonne her husbands death, to be married to three Princes one after another; Fist to Duke Iohn Sforza, secondly, to Lewis sonne to Alphonsus King of Arragon, thirdly, to Alphonsus D'Est Duke of Ferara. Alexander, of that name the sixt, With his owne childe incestuously commixt. And Paul the third (affecting the said Game) With his owne Her name was Constancia, shee was married to a Duke named Sforza, but the Pope her father poysoned her, because he could not lawfully enioy her. Also for the like, he poysoned his sister. daughter did commit the same: And after with his sister tooke such course, That he with her did doe as bad or worse. Iohn the thirteenth, and other more, 'tis plaine, Haue with their sisters and their daughters laine, And when their stomackes haue beene gone &amp; past, To Princes they haue married them at last. Here's Bawdes of state, of high and mighty place, Our Turnbull street poore Bawdes to these are base. But those braue Doings better to disclose, A little while Ile turne my Verse to Prose. Besides, a most pernicious Bawd is hee, That for poore A flattring hireling preacher, is a Bawd to the vices of his surly Patrone, and an hypocriticall conniuer at the crying sinnes of his Audience. scraps, and a bare ten pounds fee, Dares not his mighty Patron to offend, Or any way his vices reprehend, Nor preach 'gainst pride, oppression, vsury, Dice, drinke or drabbes, vaine oathes or simonie, Nor Veniall sinne or Mortall, or nothing That may his Worship in the Withers wring: But euery way must fit his Text and time, To leaue vntoucht th'Impropriators crime. Thus those whose functions Heauen doth dignifie, (Who should like Trumpets lift their voyces high) Are mute and muzzled, for a hireling price, And so are Bawdes vnto their Patrones vice; For he's a Bawd who doth his Liuing winne By hiding, or by flattring peoples sinne. The The Deuill is the chiefe Bawd. Prince of darknesse, King of Acheron, Great Emperor of Styx and Phlegeton, Cocitus Monarch, high and mighty Dis, Who of Great Limbo-Lake Commander is, Of Tartary, of Erebus, and all Those Kingdomes which men Barathrum doe call, He is the chiefest Bawd, and still he plods To send vs Whoring after godlesse gods: And by his sway, and powerfull Instigation, Hath made the world stark drunk with fornication. For since the first Creation, neuer was The least degree of Bawdry brought to passe, But he began it and contriu'd it still, He laid the Plot, and did the Act fulfill. So that of all the Bawdes that euer were, The Deuill himselfe the bell away doth beare: Yet all his whoring base Idolatry, Did seeme Religious zealous sanctitie. To close vp all, the summe of all is this, I'l end my booke as Ouid ended his. So long as on the Poles the spangled firmament shall whirle, So long as Procreation shall beget a Boy or Girle, So long as winter shall be cold, or summer shall be hot, So long as pouerty and spight shall be true vertues lot, When Phœbus in the West shall rise, and in the East shall set, When children (on their mothers) their owne fathers shall beget; Then shall this booke, or Bawd lye dead, and neuer till that day, Shall Booke or Bawd, or Bawd or Booke, be scarce, if men will pay. Till Sun and Moone shall cease to shine, and all the world lye wast; So long this Booke, or else a Bawd, I'm sure, so long shall last. FINIS.

[A Common Whore with all these graces grac'd] A Common Whore with all these graces grac'd; Shee's very honest, beautifull and chaste. With a comparison betweene a Whore and a Booke.

Iohn Taylor. A WHORE. In this poem footnotes are anchored in the text. Where anchors and footnotes do not correspond, no attempt has been made to match them. My Booke, an honest Whore I fitly call, Because it trears of whores in generall: Then though this Pamphlet I doe name a Whore, Let no man shun her company therefore. For if ten thousand with her lodge and lye, No reputation they shall lose thereby. No cost A cheape Whore. for dyet she at all requires, No charge for change of changeable attires, No Coaches, or Carroaches she doth craue, No base attendance of a Pand'ring Knaue, Perfumes and Paintings she abhorres and hates, Nor doth she borrow haire from other pates. And this much more Ile boldly say for her, Whoso redeemes her from the Stationer, (With whom she as a Slaue is kept in hold, And at his pleasure daily bought and sold) I say, that man that doth her ransome pay, She will requite his kindnesse euery way; Her Inside with such Treasury is stor'd, As may become the Pocket of a Lord; All, from the Cottage, to the Castle high, From Palatines vnto the Peasantry, (If they'l permit their wisedomes rule their will) May keepe this whore, and yet be honest still. Yet is she A strange Whore, common, and yet honest. Common vnto all that craue her, For sixe pence honest man or knaue may haue her, To be both turn'd and tost, she free affords, And (like a prating whore) she's full of words; But all her talke is to no other end, Then to teach Whoremasters and Whores to mend. She in plaine termes vnto the world doth tell, Whores are the Hackneys which men ride to Hell, And by comparisons she truely makes A whore worse then a common Shore, or Iakes. A Succubus, a damned sinke of sinne, A mire, where worse then Swine doe wallow in. And with a whore (although thus plaine she be) She shewes a Whoremonger as bad as she. And though I barren am of Eloquence, Nor neuer vnderstood my Accidence: Yet though I haue no learning to my share, A whore to broken Latine Ile compare: First, if her minde on whoring she doth fix, Shee's all compact of mirth, all Meretrix, And with small teaching she will soone decline Mulier into the Gender Masculine, By her Attire, of which sex she should be, She seemes the doubtfull Gender vnto me, To either side her habit seemes to leaue, And may be taken for the Epicene. Vnto the Newter I compare her can, For she's for thee, or me, or any man. In her Declensions she so farre doth goe, As to the common of two or three, or moe, And come to horum, harum, Whorum, then She proues a great proficient amongst men. Then after she had learn'd these Lessons right, She forward goes vnto hoc leue light: She paints out pulcher, ayded by her glasse, She's neither bonus, or yet bonitas. Homo for all men, is a common name, And she for all men is a common shame. Not lapis singularly, her can please, She loues the plurall number lapides. To construe plainly, she is seldome curious, The two hard words of durus and of durius, Though she's not past the Whip, she's past the Rods, And knowes to ioyne her qui's, her quæ's, and quod's. The Actiue from the Passiue shee'l deriue, Her Mood commands like the Imparatiue; She knowes no Concords, yet to all men thus, She faine would be Iucundus omnibus; Clam is the Cloake, that couers her offence, Her goodnesse all is in the Future tense. She's facile fieti, (quickly wonne) Or Const'ring truly, Easie to be done. Parui dacitur probitas, sets forth Her honesty is reckoned little worth: And he shall finde, that takes her for his choyce, An Interiection, or Imperfect voyce. Among the rules of Gender, she by heart, Can without missing daily say her part. The first among them all she liketh best, Propria quæ Maribus, and there she'l rest. Thus may a Whore be made (by this construction) Vnto the Grammar Rules an Introduction. But yet if Learning might be gotten so, Few to the Vniuersities would goe. And all degrees, tagge, ragge, and old, and yong, Would be well grounded in the Latine tongue: Whil'st many learn'd men would be forc'd to seeke Their liuings from the Hebrew and the Greeke: For mine owne part I dare to sweare and vow, I ne'r vs'd Accidence so much as now, Nor all these Latine words here enterlac'd, I doe not know if they with sense are plac'd, I in the Booke did find them, and conclude, At random to a Whore I them allude. But leauing Latine, eu'ry trading wench Hath much more vnderstanding of the French. If shee hath learn'd great P, O Perse O, She'le quickly know De morbo Gallico. If in these rudiments she well doth enter. With any man she neuer feares to venter: She's impudently arm'd, and shamelesse too, And neuer dreads what man to her can do: Her neather part to stake shee'l often lay, To keepe her vpper part in fashion gay; She blushes not to haue her Trade well knowne, Which is, she liues by vsing of her owne. Her shop, her ware, her fame, her shame, her game, 'Tis all her owne, which none from her can claime. And if she be halfe mad, and curse and sweare, And fight, and bite, and scatch, and domineere: Yet still she proues her patience to be such, 'Midst all these passions she will beare too much. She is not couetous for any thing, For what she hath, men doe vnto her bring, (Her Temp'rance is a vertue of much honour) And all her Commings in are put vpon her. She's generall, she's free, she's liberall Of hand and purse, she's open vnto all, She is no miserable hidebound wretch, To please her friend at any time shee'l stretch; At once she can speake true, and lye, or either, And is at home, abroad, and altogether. Shee's nimbler then a Tumbler, as I thinke, Layes downe, and takes vp, whilst a man can winke: And though she seeme vnmeasur'd in her pleasure, 'Tis otherwayes, a Yard's her onely measure. But as most Whores are vicious in their fames, So many of them haue most Vertuous names, Though bad they be, they will not bate an Ace To be cald Prudence, Temp'rance, Faith, or Grace, Or Mercy, Charity, or many more, Good names (too good to giue to any Whore.) Much from the Popes of Rome they doe not swerue, For they haue Names which they doe ill deserue; Onely betwixt them here's the difference on't, A Whore receiues her Name first at the Font: The Roman Bishop takes a larger scope, For he doth change his name, when he's a Pope. As if he were a Persecuting Saul. If he please hee'l be call'd a Preaching Paul. Is his name Swinesnowt, he can change the Case, And swap away that name for Boniface: If he be most vngodly, and enuious. Yet if he please, he will be called Pius: Be he by Nature to all mischiefe bent, He may and will be called Innocent; And be he neuer so doggedly inclin'd, Hee'l be nam'd Vrbano, if it be his mind. If he be much more fearefull then a Sheepe, The name of Leo he may haue and keepe. And though he be vnmercifull, yet still He may be called Clement if he will. Thus Popes may haue good names, though bad they be, And so may Whores, though different in degree. The Anagram of Whore's her mortall foe, Deuided into two words, 'tis Her Wo. And seriously (to lay all lesting by) A Whore is Her owne Woe, and misery. For though she haue all pleasures at the full, Much more then Thais, that proud Corinthians Trull, Who suffered none but Kings and Potentates To haue their pleasures, at Excessiue rates, Yet all that Deare-bought Lechery would be The greater brand of lasting Infamy, And though her Carrion Corps, rich clad, high fed, (Halfe rotten liuing, and all rotten Dead) Who with her hellish Courage, stout and hot, Abides the brunt of many a prickshaft shot: Yet being dead, and doth consumed lye, Her euerlasting shame shall neuer dye. Ixion (in his armes) he did suppose That he the Goddesse Iuno did inclose: But in the end his franticke error show'd, That all which he imbrac'd was but a Cloud. So whosoeuer doe their Lust embrace, In stead of Loue are clouded with disgrace. The Godlesse Goddesse Venus, honour'd farre, For conqu'ring of the Conqu'ring God of Warre, To hide their shame they no defence could get, When limping Uulcan tooke them in a net; And being past shame, with that foule offence, She arm'd her selfe with shamelesse Impudence. And with vngodly articles would proue, That foule Concupiscence and Lust is Loue. For which each bawdy Knaue, and filthy Whore, Her Deuillish Diety doe still adore. I haue read Histories that doe repeat Whores were of old in estimation Great: Pandemus King of Corinth, he erected (That he from Perses power might be protected) A Temple vnto Venus, as some say, Where whores might for his safety safely pray. And some in Ephesus did Temples reare, In whom the Paphean Queenes adored were, Where they that were the wickedst whores of all, Were the chiefe Priests in robes Pontificall. And in the Ile of Paphos, 'twas the vse Maides got their Dowries, by their Corps abuse: But if that order were allowed here, So many would not portions want I feare. The Art of Bawd'ry was in such respect Amongst the Egyptians, that they did erect An Altar to Priapus, and their guise Was, that their Priests on it did Sacrifice. Wise Arictotle was in wit so poore, He Sacrific'd to Hermia his whore, Great Iulius Cæsar, was so free and Common, And cald a husband vnto euery woman. Procullus Emperour, (the Story sayes) Deflowr'd one hundred Maydes in Sermatian Maydes. fifteene dayes. If all be true that Poets vse to write, Hercules lay with fifty in one night. When Heliogabulus Romes Scepter sway'd, And all the world his lawlesse Lawes obay'd; He in his Court did cause a Stewes be made, Whereas Cum priuilegio, whores did trade: H'inuited two and twenty of his friends, And kindly to each one a whore he lends. To set whores free, that then in bondage lay, A mighty masse of money he did pay: He (in one day) gaue to each whore in Rome A Duckat (a large and ill bestowed summe. There are no anchors in the text for these notes.— a) Here, I haue for some 60 lines followed the report of Cornelius Agrippa, in his Vanity of sciences. c) 30. pound waight a peace. He made Orations vnto whores, and said They were his Souldiers, his defence and ayde; And in his speech he shew'd his wits acute, Of sundry formes of Bawdr'y to dispute. And after giuing vnto euery whore, For list'ning to his tale three Duckats more, With Pardon vnto all and Liberty That would be whores within his Monarchy. And yeerly Pensions, hee freely gaue, To keepe a Regiment of whores, most braue. And oft he had (when hee in Progresse went) Of whores, Bawds, Panders, such a Rabblement, Sixe hundred Waggons, History reports, Attended onely on these braue consorts. This was a Royall whoremaster indeed, A speciall Or rather, Malefactor. Benefactor at their need: But now since Heliogabalus deceast, I thinke the world with whores is so increast, That if it had an Emperour as mad, He might haue twice so many as he had. For by experience wee see euery day, That bad things doe increase, good things decay. And vertue (with much care) from vertue breeds, Vice freely springs from vice, like stinking weeds. Sardanapalus King of Babylon, Was to his whores such a companion, That hee in their attire did sow and sing, (An exercise vnfitting for a King.) This feruent Lust, (which some call ardent Loue) Did cause the Bastard Hercules. of the mighty Ioue To please his Iöle, hee tooke a Wheele, And (laying by his Club) did spin and Reele. Great Ioue himselfe could not this snare escape, Lust led him on to many a shamelesse Rape. Poore Hebe, Hele, Iupiter transformed himselfe into all these shapes to attaine his desire. Darna, and Europa, Alemena, Iö, Semele, and Leada, Antiopa, Asterie, Ganemede, These and a number more his fancy fed. To compasse which, his shifts were manifold, T'a Bull, a Ram, a Swan, a showre of Gold, To dreadfull Thunder, and consuming fire, And all to quench his inward flames desire. Apollo turn'd faire Daphne into The Bay tree or Lawrell. Bay, Because shee from his Lust did flye away, Hee lou'd his Hiacinct, and his Coronis, As feruently as Venus and Adonis, So much hee from his God-head did decline, That for a wench he kept Admetus Kine. And many other gods haue gone astray, If all be true which Ouids Booke doth say. Thus to fulfill their Lusts, and win their Truls, Wee see that these vngodly gods were Guls. The mighty Captaine Achilles, who was slaine (befotted to his death) for the loue of Polixena. of the Mermidons, Being captiu'd to these base passions, Met an vntimely vnexpected slaughter, For faire Polixena, King Priams daughter. Lucrecia's Rape, was Tarquins ouerthrow, (Shame often payes the debt that sinne doth owe.) What Philomela lost, and Tereus wonne, It causde the lustfull Father Tereus King of Thrace ate of his owne Sonne Itis, made into pymeat by his wife Progue. eate his Sonne. In this vice, Nero tooke such beastly ioy. He married was to Sporus, a yong Boy. And A Tyrant Prince in Corinth. Periander was with Lust so led, He with Mellissa lay when shee was dead. Pigmalion, Plutarch. with an Image made of Stone, Did loue and lodge: (I'le rather lye alone.) Aristophanes, ioyn'd in loue would be To a shee Asse: but what an Asse was he? A Roman Appius murthered himselfe, because Virginias father had slaine her, to free her from his Lust. Appius did in Iale abide, For loue of faire Virginia, where hee dyde. Our second Henry King Henry the second King of England. Aged, Childish, fond, On the faire feature of faire Rosamond: That it rais'd most vnnaturall hatefull strife Betwixt himselfe, his children, and his wife. The end of which was, that the iealous Queene Did poyson Woodstocke. Rosamond in furious spleene. The fourth King Edward lower did descend, He to a Goldsmiths wife Mistris Shore. his loue did bend. This sugred sinne hath beene so generall, That it hath made the strongest Champions fall. For Sichem rauisht She was Iacobs daughter, whose Rape was accursedly reuenged by her brethren, Simeon and Leui, Genesis. Dina, for which deed A number of the Sichemites did bleed. And Samson, in the prime of manly strength, By Dalila was ouercome at length. King Dauid frailely fell, and felt the paine, And with much sorrow was restor'd againe. Though Saul his foe he no way would offend, Yet this sinne made him kill his loyall friend. Ammon with a Sam. 11. Thamar, Incest did commit, And Absalon depriu'd his life for it. And Salomon allow'd most Royall meanes To keepe three hundred Queenes, seuen hundred queanes, By whose meanes to Idolatry he fell, Almost as low as to the gates of Hell. At last repeating, he makes declaration, That all was vanity, and spirits vexation. Aboundance of examples men may finde, Of Kings and Princes to this vice inclin'd, 2 Sam. 13. Which is no way for meaner men to goe, Because their betters oft haue wandred so; For they were plagu'd of God, and so shall we Much more, if of their sinne we partners be. To shew what Women haue beene plagued in The bottomlesse Abysse of this sweet sinne, There are examples of them infinite, Which I ne'r meane to read, much lesse to write, To please the Reader, though I'l set downe some, As they vnto my memory doe come. Flora, a Whore in Rome, great wealth did win, By her deare trading and her Commings in, Which wealth she freely gaue when she did dye, Vnto the Roman people generally, For which they all (to shew their thanks vnto her) Made her a Goddesse, and did Reuerence doe her. And Lais of Corinth, ask'd Demosthenes One hundred Crownes for one nights businesse: For which a crue of Whores did set vpon her, A Whore she was, and whores to death did stone her. There was a famous Whore She was seruant to Exanthus, and fellow to Esop the Fabulift. Rhodope nam'd, Who for her gaine at such high price she gam'd, That she (most liberall) did the charges beare, A stately high Piramides to reare. Great Iulius Cæsar was much ouerseene With Cleopatra, the Ægyptian Queene: And after, she insnar'd Marke Antony, For which, they both by their owne hands did dye. Queene of Babylon, slaine by her Sonne, whom she would haue had to haue lyen with her. Semiramis plaid the inhumane Trull, And was enamour'd with a beastly Bull: So did Pasipha wife to Mines King of Crete. Pasipha, but me thinks 'tis strange, That Queenes so farre from womenhood should range. Mirha (Adonis mother) caus'd her father The flower of her virginitie to gather. If wise Vlysses had not well beene arm'd, Inchanting Circe had his honor charm'd. When youthfull Paris stole the lustfull Punke, Faire Hellen, had the ship that bore them iunke, Then thirty Kings in peace at home had staid, Nor Troy or Troians in their ruines laid: Faire Messalina and Faustine, two Empresses. Messalina, a most royall Whore, (Wife vnto Claudius the Emperour) The sports of Venus in the Stewes did play, Sometimes full fiue and twenty times a day. Marcus Aurelius did faire Faustine wed, And she with Whoring did behorne his head. And many Princes and great Potentates, With Vulcans crest haue arm'd their noble pates: This to the poorest Cuckold seemes a bliss, That he with mighty Monarchs sharer is, That though to be cornuted be a griefe, Yet to haue such braue partners is reliefe. These Whores and Whore-masters which I haue nam'd, And thousands more (in histories defam'd) With partiall selfe-opinion did approue, Their sensuality and Lust was Loue. When as the ods is more then day from night, Or fire from water, blacke from purest white. The one with God, one with the Deuill doth dwell, Loue comes fr? heauen, &amp; lust doth spring from hell. But the old Prouerbe, ne'r will be forgot, A Lechers loue is (like Sir Reuerence) hot, And on the sudden cold as any stone, For when the lust is past, the loue is gone. But Loue is such a blessing from on hie, Whose zealous feruency can neuer die; It out-liues life, and the ascending flame, Mounts to the God of Loue, from whence it came. Lust made Genesis. Seths sons, with fornication vaine, Ioyne with the daughters of accursed Cain. And the world suffered, for their fornication, Depopulation, by the inundation. And twenty and foure thousand Israelites Dyde for this sinne amongst the Numbers. Madianites. For the not punishing this fact (almost) The Tribe of Iudges. 19. 20 and 21. 65000. were slaine of the Israelites, and there remained of the Beniamites onely 600. Beniamin were slaine and lost. May this be call'd loue? Then call vertue vice, And euery bawdy house a Paradise. If lust were loue, it would not like a Wolfe, Drowne Louers hearts in desperations Gulfe. A Theban, For Antigona the daughter of Oedipus and Iocasta. Hamon, himselfe madly kill'd, On his too deere deers Tombe his heart bloud spild. For Phaon (a poore Watermans sweet sake) Faire Sapho from a rocke, her The more foole-shee, though shee were a Poetesse. necke shee brake. Pheadra for her Hippolitus, they say, Did hang her selfe, and make a Holli-day. And Shee was daughter to Licurgus King of Thrace. Phillis for Sonne to Theseus, Demophoon did as much: Ile neuer loue, if Loues effects be such. To quench the Carthaginian Dido, for Encas, burned herselfe. Queenes desire, Shee burnt her selfe vpon a pile of fire. If either Priamus, or Thisby had Not beene starke fooles, or else exceeding mad: The doting, idle, misconceiuing Elues, So desperately, had ne'r fore-done themselues. Thus all the difference betwixt loue and lust, Is one is iust, the other is vniust. Search but in Histories, and men may find Examples beyond numbring, of this kind, How of both Sexes, and each state and sort Of people from the cottage to the Court, Haue madly run this course; some hang'd, some drownd, Burnt, staru'd &amp; stab'd th?selues with many a wo?d, Or pin'd away like Coxcombs, euer crauing To haue the thing, that's neuer worth the hauing. In Antwerp many filthy Whores I saw, That for their Trading were allowde by Law. And I in Prague did see a street of Whores, An English mile in length, who at their doores Did stand and ply (rich clad, and painted rare) More hard then euer I plyde for a fare. Th'Italian Stewes (to make the Pope good cheere) Payd twenty thousand Duckets in a Almost euery yeere a ducket is more then 8 shillings, which summe is 80001. yeere. Besides, they giue a Priest (t'amend his fee) The profit of a Whore, or two, or three. Me thinkes it must be bad Diuinity, That with the Stewes hath such affinity. 'Tis a mad Doctrine, Lechery should pay A Church-mans stipend, that should preach &amp; pray, And in those stewes, where women are so common, In entertaining all, refusing no man, Whereas a father with a Whore may lye, Which done, his sonne his place may hap supply, And then an Vnkle, or a Brother may Succeed each other in that damned play: For no propinquity, or no degree Of kin, that hant there, that can sweare th'are free From this commixion: and, which is worst, A Whore may haue a bastard, borne and nurst, And growne a woman, and to this trade set her, May be a Whore to him that did beget her; Or to her brothers, or to all her kin, Shee may be prostituted in this sin. And therefore to conclude this point, I muse That Christian Common-wealths allow a Stewes. I thinke that Thieues as well allow'd should be, As Whores and Whoremasters should thus be free. They from the Heathen doe examples bring, That Whoring is a rare commodious thing, There was an ancient vse in Babylon, When as a womans stocke was spent and gone, Her liuing it was lawfull then to get, Her carkasse out to liuerie to let, And Venus did allow the Cyprian Dames, To get their liuings by their bodies shames. Licurgus did a Law in Sparta make, That all men might their barren wiues forsake: And by the same Law it ordained was, Wiues might vnable husbands turne to grasse. And the wise Solon the Athenian, Allow'd whores to be free for any man. And though these things the Pagan people did, Yet Christian gouernments these things forbid. But ther's no Common-wealth maintains the same, But where the Not in any place but where Romes supremacie is allowed. Pope is Landlord of the game. The Stewes in England bore a beastly sway, Till the eight Anno Regni 37. Henry banish'd them away: And since those common whores were quite put downe, A damned crue of priuate whores are growne, So that the diuell will be doing still, Either with publique or with priuate ill. Thus much for whoring I must say agen, It hath produced many valiant men: Braue Bastards haue beene famous Conquerours, And some great Lords, and Kings, and Emperours. As Hercules Ioues mighty Bastard-sonne, And So sayes Cornelius Agrippa, but I finde it otherwise in Quintus Curtius. Alexander King of Macedon: Clodouee King of France, from Bastardie, And William Conqueror, from Normandie. These, and a number more I could recite, Besides the vnknowne numbers infinite. And sure that wretched man that married is Vnto a wife dispos'd to this amiss, Is mad to wrong himselfe at all thereby, With heart-griefe and tormenting iealousie. If he hath cause for't, let him then forsake her, And pray God mend her, or the diuell take her: If she hath no cause to be iealous then, He's worthy to be made the scorne of men. Thus cause or no cause, man himselfe should arme, That iealousie should neuer doe him harme. The Nicholaitans, to auoid the paine Of iealousie, amongst them did ordaine, That all their married wiues, of each degree, To euery one a common Whore should be. And so amongst them one could hardly finde, A Cuckold that did beare a iealous minde. When I but thinke what Sciences, and Arts, What men and women, full of ex'lent parts, Forget their functions, lay their vertues by, And wait and liue, and thriue by Lecherie. A Poets Art, all other Arts excell, If he hath skill and grace to vse it well: Yet many times 'tis vs'd most base and vile, When it descends vnto a bawdy stile, To turne good humane studies, and diuine, Into most beastly lines, like Aretine; To seeke to merit euer-liuing Bayes, For sordid stuffe (like Ouids lustfull Layes.) With false bewitching verses to entice Fraile creatures from faire vertue to foule vice, Whose flattry makes a Whore to seeme a Saint, That stinkes like carrion, with her Pox and paint. Comparing her (with false and odious lies) To all that's in or vnderneath the skies, Her eyes to Sunnes, that doe the Sunne Eclips, Her Cheekes are Roses (Rubies are her lips) Her white and red Carnation mixt with snow, Her teeth to orientall pearle, a Row, Her voice like Musicke of the heau'nly Spheares, Her haire like thrice refined golden Wires, Her breath more sweet then Arromaticke drugs, Like Mounts of Alabaster are her dugs. Her Bracelets, Rings, her Scarfe, her Fan, her Chaine, Are subiects to inspire a Poets braine: But aboue all, her Smock most praise doth win, For 'tis the Curtaine next vnto her skin. Her loose Gowne, for her looser body fit, Shall be adored with a flash of wit, And from the Chin-clowe, to the lowly Slipper, In Heliconian streames his praise shall dip her. I leaue vnnam'd what is affected best. As 'tis most fit, for it maintaines the rest; Her thighs, her knees, her legs, her feet, and all, From top to toe are supernaturall. Her Iuory hands, with saphire veines inlaid. Which cannot be by mortall pen displaid. Her smile makes cold December Summer like, Her frown, hot Iune with shiuering Frost can strike, And life, and doath doth in her lookes abide, Or many Knaues and Fooles that said so, lyde. Her Shapperoones, her Perriwigs and Tires, Are Reliques, which this flatt'ry much admires, Rebaroes, Manke, her Busk and Busk-point too, As things to which mad men must homage doe. Her Verdingale, her Garters, Shooes and Roses; Her Girdle that her wastfull waste incloses. Not one of these but's honour'd with a Sonet, If the said Poet be but set vpon it. Another seekes to win his Wenches will, With oylie Oratories smoothing skill. Here's a sweet deale of scimble scamble stuffe, To please my Lady Wagtaylo (marry muffe) Gep with the Grinkcomes is an Vtopian word, which is in English a P. at Paris. Grinkcomes (but I speake too late) This kinde of flatt'ry makes a whore take state, Growes pocky pround, and in such port doth beare her, That such poore scabs as I, must not come neere her. Thus may shee liue, (much honour'd for her crimes) And haue the Pox some twelue or 13 times, And shee may be so bountifull agen, To sell those Pox to three or fourescore men: And thus the Surgeons may get more by farre, By Whores and Peace, then by the sword and warre. And thus a Whore (if men consider of it) Is an increasing gainfull piece of profit. But of all Whores that I haue nam'd before, There's none so cunning as the Citie Whore, Shee hath so many seuerall sorts of Bawds, To cloake and couer her deceipts and frauds, That sure the Deuill cannot more deuise Then shee, to blind her horned husbands eyes. One offers Purles to sell, and fine Bone-lace, And whispers that her Friend's in such a place: A second offers Starch, and tels her how Her sweet-heart tarries for her at the Plow: A third sels Wafers, and a fourth hath Pins, And with these tricks these Bawds admittance wins That had her Husband Argos eyes, yet he By these deceiuers should deceiued be. If all these faile, a begger-woman may, A sweet loue letter to her hands connay. Or a neat Laundresse, or a Hearbwife can, Carry a sleeuelesse message now and than. Or if this faile, her teeth may ake (forsooth) And then the Barbar must come draw a Tooth: Or else shee may be sicke (vpon condition) That such a Doctor may be her Physition, He feeles her pulses, and applyes his trade With Potions which th'Apothecary made; All's one for that, her health shee quickly gaines, Her Husband payes the Doctor for his paines. But of all Bawds, Gold is the Bawd indeed, It seldome speakes but it is sure to speed: It can blind Watches, open bolts and locks, Breake walls of stone, as hard as Marble rocks: Make Iron barres giue way, and gates fly ope, Giues Lust the reynes to run with boundlesse scope, Kils Iealousie, appeases Riuals, and Doth what the owners will or can command, And last of all, it stops the biting iawes Of the iust rigorous, and seuerest Lawes. I therefore say, He that hath golden pelfe, Hath a good Bawd, if so he please himselfe: Those that haue gold, can want no Bawds or Que?s Except they vse a meane, to guide their meanes. To end this point, this consequence Ile grant, Those that haue golden Bawds, no whores can want. And though the mighty power of gold be such, Yet Siluer (many times) can doe as much: Thus euery A scraping miserable father, that cares not how he get Gold to leaue it to a Whoremaster his Son, is his sons prouid?t Bawd. wealthy Whoremaster may beare His Bawd in's purse, or pocket any where. For mine owne part, I liue not in such want, But that I eate and sleepe, though coyne be scant: And 'cause I want the Bawd I nam'd before, By consequence I needs must want the Whore: And wanting of them both, I hope to bee, From Gowts, Pox, and extortion euer free. But as there's wondrous difference in mens meat, So is the ods of Whores exceeding great: Some Rampant, &amp; some Couchant, and some Passant, Some Guardant, &amp; some Dormant, &amp; some Cressant, Some Pendant, some (a Pox on't) but the best on't, A priuate Whore, trades safely, there's the iest on't. Besides, as Whores are of a seuerail cut, So fitting Titles on them still are put: For if a Princes loue to her decline, For manners sake shee's call'd a Concubine: If a great Lord, or Knight, affect a Whore, Shee must be term'd his Honours Paramore: The rich Gull Gallant call's her Deare and Loue, Ducke, Lambe, Squall, Sweet-heart, Cony, and his Doue: A pretty wench she's with the Country-man, And a Kind Sister with the Puritane, She's a Priests Lemman, and a Tinkers Pad, Or Dell, or Doxy (though the names bee bad) And amongst Souldiers, this sweet piece of Vice Is counted for a Captaines Cockatrice. But the mad Rascall, when hee's fiue parts drunke, Cals her his Drab, his Queane, his Iill, or Punke, And in his fury'gins to rayle and rore, Then with full mouth, he truely call's her Whore: And so I leaue her, to her hot desires, 'Mongst Pimps, and Panders, and base Applesquires, To mend or end, when age or Pox will make her Detested, and Whore-masters all forsake her. A comparison betwixt a Whore and a Booke. Me thinks I heare some Cauillers obiect, That 'tis a name absurd and indirect, To giue a Booke the Title of a Whore: When sure I thinke no Name befits it more. For like a Whore by day-light, or by Candle, 'Tis euer free for euery knaue to handle: And as a new whore is belou'd and sought, So is a new Booke in request and bought. When whores wax old and stale, they're out of date, Old Pamphlets are most subiect to such fate. As whores haue Panders to emblaze their worth, So these haue Stationers to set them forth. And as an old whore may be painted new With borrowed beauty, faire vnto the view, Whereby shee for a fine fresh whore may passe, Yet is shee but the rotten whore shee was. So Stationers, their old cast Bookes can grace, And by new Titles paint a-fresh their face. Whereby for currant they are past away, As if they had come forth but yesterday. A Booke is dedicated, now and than To some great worthy, or vnworthy man: Yet for all that, 'tis common vnto mee, Or thee, or hee, or all estates that bee: And so a man may haue a whore (forsooth) Supposing shee is onely for his tooth: But if the truth hee would seeke out and looke, She's common vnto all men, like a Booke. A Booke with gawdy coate, and silken strings, Whose inside's full of obsceane beastly things, Is like a whore, Capatison'd and trap'd, Full of infection, to all mischiefe apt. As one whore may bee common vnto any, So one Booke may bee dedicate to many. And sure I say, and hope I speake no slander, To such a Booke, the Poet is the Pander. He prostitutes his muse to euery one, Which should be constant vnto one alone: This is a kind of Bawd'ry vile and base, Kils bounty, and is Poetryes disgrace. And lest they should be lost, it is ordain'd, That Bookes within a Library are chain'd; So he that to himselfe will keepe a whore, Must chaine her, or shee'le trade with forty more. As Bookes are leafe by leafe oft turn'd and tost, So are the Garments of a whore (almost:) For both of them, with a wet finger may Be folded or vnfolded, night or day. Moreouer, 'tis not very hard to proue, That Bookes and Whores may Riuals be in Loue; (To purchase mens displeasure I am loth) But sure good Schollers still haue lou'd them both. Some Bookes haue their Errates at the last, That tell their errors and offences past. So many great Whores did in state suruiue, But when death did their hatefull liues depriue, Their faults escap'd and their Errates then Haue beene made manifest and knowne to men. Some Bookes and Whores to wicked purpose bent, Doe, for their faults, receiue one punishment. As Bookes are often burnt, and quite forgotten, So whores are ouer-stew'd, or rosted rotten, Experience shewes that Bookes much knowledge brings, And by experience whores know many things. And as true Iustice, all mens losse repaires, So whores doe giue to all men what is theirs. Terence shee learnes yet will shee much rebuke vs, If wee doe play the part of true Eunuchus. As Bookes prophane or else Hereticall, Or scurrilous, non-sense, Schismaticall, Peruerts mans Iudgement, and his soule pollutes, Such are all Whores, and such will be their fruits. Some Slouens soyle a Booke in little space, And slauer it, and so the Leaues deface: And some againe will take a cleanly course To read it dayly, yet tis ne'r the worse. So some men vse a Whore, when once they haue her, They'le touze and teare, and beastly all beslauer, When forty neat Whoremasters might haue play'd And vsde her, and shee still be thought a maide. He that doth read a Booke he likes, would be Alone, from any Interruption free; And hee that with a Whore would toy or lye, I thinke desires no other Company. When Bookes are wet, their beauties gone or soyl'd, So, wash a Whore, and all her paintings spoyl'd: And as an old Whore (spight of Paint and cloathing) Fals at the last, the obiect of mens loathing, Scorn'd and vnpittied, and to finish all, Dyes in a Ditch, or in an Hospitall: So Pamphlets, and some workes of writers Graue, Are vsde much worse then Whores by many a Knaue: Who ne'r regard the matter or the price, But teare like Tyrants, to wrap Drugs or Spice, Or which is worse, in Priuie matters vse them, Or worst of all, like Roarers they abuse them: When as they rend good Bookes to light and dry Tobacco (Englands bainefull Diety.) And 'tis a thing I ne'r thought on before, A Now a dayes. Booke's examin'd stricter then a Whore: There's not a Sheet, a Leafe, a Page, a Verse.

I lately to the world did send a A oke I writ called a Whore. whore, And she was welcom, though she was but poore, And being so, it did most strange appeare That pouerty found any welcome here, But when I saw that many Rich men sought My whore, &amp; with their coyne her freedome bought, I mus'd, but as the cause I out did ferrit I found some Rich in Purse, some poore in merit, Some learned Schollers, some that scarce could spell: Yet all did loue an honest whore, right well, Twas onely such as those that entertain'd her, Whilest scornfull Knaues, &amp; witlesse Fooles disdain'd her. Now to defend her harmelesse Innocence, I send this Thiefe to be her Iust defence: Against all true-men, and I'l vndertake There are not many that dare answer make. Then rowze my Muse, be valiant, and be briefe, Be confident, my true and constant Thiefe: Thy trade is scatt'red, vniuersally, Throughout the spacious worlds Rotundity, For all estates and functions great and small, Are for the most part Thieues in generall, Excepting Millers, Weauers, Taylers, and Such true trades as no stealing vnderstand. Thou art a Thiefe (my Booke) and being so Thou findst thy fellowes wheresoeu'r thou goe: Birds of a feather still will hold together, And all the world with thee are of a feather: The ods is, thou art a Thiefe by nomination, And most of men are Thieues in their vocation. Thou neither dost cog, cheat, steale, sweare or lye, Or gather'st goods by false dishonesty, And thou shalt liue when many of the Crue Shall in a Halter bid the world Adue. And now a thought into my minde doth fall, To proue whence Thieues haue their originall: I finde that Iupiter did watonly On Maya get a sonne call'd Mercury, To whom the people oft did sacrifice, Accounting him the God of Merchandize: Of Eloquence, and rare inuention sharpe, And that he first of all deuis'd the Harpe. The God of Tumblers, Iuglers, fooles and Iesters, Of Thieues and fidlers that the earth bepesters, Faire Uenus was his Sister, and I finde He was to her so much vnkindely kinde, That hee on her begat Hermophrodite, As Ouid very wittily doth write: His wings on head and heeles true Emblems bee, How quick he can inuent, how quickly flee: By him are Thieues inspirde, and from his gift They plot to steale and run away most swift: In their conceits and sleights, no men are sharper, Each one as nimble-finger'd as a Harper. Thus Thieuing is not altogether base, But is descended from a lofty Race. Moreouer euery man, himselfe doth show To be the Sonne of Adam, for wee know He stole the Fruit, and euer since his Seed, To steale from one another haue agreed. Our Infancy is Theft, 'tis manifest Wee crie and Rob our Parents of their Rest: Our Childe-hood Robs vs of our Infancy, And youth doth steale our childe-hood wantonly: Then Man-hood pilfers all our youth away, And middle-age our Man-hood doth conuay Vnto the Thieuing hands of feeble age: Thus are wee all Thieues, all our Pilgrimage, In all which progresse many times by stealth, Strange sicknesses doe Rob vs of our health. Rage steales our Reason, Enuy thinkes it fit To steale our Loue, whilest Folly steales our wit. Pride filcheth from vs our Humility, And Lechery doth steale our honesty, Base Auarice, our Conscience doth purloin, Whilest sloth to steale our mindes from work doth ioyne: Time steales vpon vs, whilest wee take small care, And makes vs old before wee be aware: Sleepe and his brother Death conspite our fall, The one steales halfe our liues, the other all. Thus are wee Robb'd by Morpheus, and by Mors, Till in the end, each Corps is but a Coarse, Note but the seasons of the yeere, and see How they like Thieues to one another bee; From Winters frozen face, through snow &amp; showres, The Spring doth steale roots, plants, buds &amp; flowers, Then Summer Robs the Spring of natures sute, And haruest Robs the Summer of his fruite, Then Winter comes againe, and he bereaues The Haruest of the Graine, and Trees of Leaues, And thus these seasons Rob each other still Round in their course, like Horses in a mill. The Elements, Earth, Water, Ayre, and Fire To rob each other daily doe conspire: The fiery Sun from th'Ocean, and each Riuer Exhales their Waters, which they all deliuer: This water, into Clowdes the Ayre doth steale, Where it doth vnto Snow or Haile congeale, Vntill at last Earth robs the Ayre againe Of his stolne Treasure, Haile, Sleete, Snow or Raine. Thus be it hot or cold, or dry or wet, These Thieues, from one another steale and get. Night robs vs of the day, and day of night: Light pilfers darknes, and the darknes light. Thus life, death, seasons, and the Elements, And day and night, for Thieues are presidents. Two arrant Thieues we euer beare about vs, The one within, the other is without vs; All that we get by toyle, or industry, Our Backes and Bellies steale continually: For though men labour with much care and carke, Lie with the Lamb downe, rise vp with the Larke, Sweare and forsweare, deceaue, and lie and cog, And haue a Conscience worse then any Dog, Be most vngracious, extreme vile and base, And (so he gaine) not caring for disgrace: Let such a Man or Woman count their gaines, They haue but meat, and raiment for their paines. No more haue they that doe liue honestest, Those that can say their Consciences are best, Their Bellies and their Backes, day, night and houre, The fruits of all their labours doe deuoure: These Thieues doe rob vs, with our owne good will, And haue dame natures warrant for it still, Sometimes these Sharks doe worke each others wracke, The rauening Belly, often robs the backe: Will feed like Diues, with Quaile, Raile, &amp; Pheasant, And be attir'd all tatter'd like a Peasant. Sometimes the gawdy Backe mans Belly pines, For which he often with Duke Humphrey dines: The whilest the mind defends this hungry stealth, And saies a temp'rate dyet maintaines health, Let Corland cry, let guts with famine mourne, The maw's vnseene, good outsides must be worne, Thus doe these Thieues rob vs, and in this pother The mind consents, and then they rob each other: Our knowledge and our learning (oft by chance) Doth steale and rob vs of our ignorance: Yet ignorance may sometimes gaine promotion (Where it is held the mother of deuotion) But knowledge ioyn'd with learning, are poore things, That many times a man to begg'ry brings: And fortune very oft doth iustly fit Some to haue all the wealth, some all the wit. Tobacco robs some men, if so it list, It steales their coyne (as Thieues doe) in a mist: Some men to rob the pot will ne'r refraine, Vntill the pot rob them of all againe. A prodigall can steale exceeding briefe, Picks his owne purse, and is his owne deare Thiefe: And thus within vs, and without vs we Are Thieues, and by Thieues alwaies pillag'd be. First then vnto the greatest Thieues of all, Whose Thieu'ry is most high and capitall: You that for pomp, and Titles transitory, Rob your Almighty Maker of his Glory, And giue the honour due to him alone, Vnto a carued block, a stock or stone, An image, a similitude, or feature Of Angell, Saint, or Man, or any creature, To Altars, Lamps, to Holy-bread, or Waters, To shrines, or tapers, or such iugling matters, To reliques of the dead, or of the liuing; This is the most supremest kind of Thieuing. Besides they all commit this fellony, That breake the Sabbath day maliciously, God giues vs six daies, and himselfe hath one, Wherein he would (with thanks) be call'd vpon: And those that steale that day to bad abuses, Rob God of honour, without all excuses: Vnto these Thieues, my Thiefe doth plainly tell, That though they hang not here, they shall in hell, Except repentance, (and vnworthy Guerdon Through our Redeemers merits) gaine their pardon. Then there's a crue of Thieues that prie and lurch, And steale and share the liuings of the Church; These are hells factors, merchants of all euill, Rob God of soules, and giue them to the Deuill, For where the tythe of many a Parish may Allow a good sufficient Preacher pay, Yet hellish pride or lust, or auarice, Or one or other foule licencious vice, Robs learning, robs the people of their teaching, (Who in seuen yeeres perhaps doe heare no preaching) When as the Parsonage by account is found Yeerely worth two, three or foure hundred pound, Yet are those Soules seru'd, or else staru'd, I feare, With a poore In the 93. page of a Booke, called The Spirit of Detraction, the Author cites 12. parishes in one Hundred in Wales in this predicament. Reader for eight pounds a yeere. A Preacher breakes to vs the Heau'nly Bread, Whereby our straying Soules are taught and fed: And for this heau'nly worke of his, 'tis sence That men allow him earthly recompence. For shall he giue vs food that's spirituall, And not haue meanes to feed him corporall? No sure: (of all men) 'tis most manifest, A painfull Churchman earnes his wages best. Those that keepe backe the Tythes, I tell them true, Are arrant Thieues in robbing God of's due: For he that robs Gods Church (t'encrease his pelfe) 'Tis most apparent, he robs God himselfe. The Patron oft deales with his Minister As Dionysius did with Iupiters Idoll in Stracusa in Sicilia. Iupiter, He stole his golden Cloake, and put on him A Coat of cotton, (nothing neere so trim) And to excuse his theft, he said the gold Was (to be worne) in Winter time, too cold, But in the Summer, 'twas too hot and heauy, And so some Patrones vse the tribe of Leuy: That for the Winters cold, or Summers heat, They are so pold, they scarce haue cloathes &amp; meat. Amongst the rest, there may some pastors be. Who enter in through cursed Simonie: But all such are notorious Thieues therefore, They climb the wall, &amp; not come through the The doore is Christ. dore: Thus Menelaus did the Priesthood win From Iason, by this simonayck sin, For he did pay three hundred tallents more Then Iason would (or could) disburse therefore. And many a mitred Pope and Cardinall This way haue got their state Pontificall: These rob and steale, for which all good men grieues, And make the house of prayer a den of Thieues. But though the Hangman, here they can out-face, Yet they shall all hang in a worser place. Then there are Thieues, who make the Church their gaines, Who can preach well, yet will not take the paines: Dumb dogs, or rau'ning wolues, whose carelesse care Doth fat themselues &amp; keepe their flocks most bare. Besides Church-wardens, with a griping fist, Like Thieues may rob their Vestry, if they list. The poores neglector (O I pardon craue) Collector I should say, may play the knaue, The Thiefe I would haue said, but chuse you whether, He may be both, and so he may be neither. So leauing Church-Thieues, with their cursed stealth, I'll now descend vnto the Common wealth. And yet me thinkes I should not passe the Court, But sure Thieues dare not thither to resort. But of all Thieues in any Kings Dominion, A flatterer is a cutpurse of opinion, That like a pick-pocket, doth lye and wayte, To steale himselfe into a mans conceit. This Thiefe will often dawbe a great mans vice, Or rate his vertue at too low a price, Or at too high a pitch his worth will raise, To fill his eares with flatt'ry any wayes. Surueyors, and Purueyors, now and then May steale, and yet be counted honest men. When men doe for their liuing labour true, He's a base Thiefe, that payes them not their due. They are all Thieues, that liue vpon the fruits Of Monopolies, of vngodly suits. The Iudge or Iustice that do bribes desire, Like Thieues, deserue a halter for their hire. A Reuerend Father, worthy of beleeuing, Said, Taking bribes was Gentleman-like Thieuing. A Merchant now and then his goods may bring, And steale the custome, and so rob the King. Thieues they are all, that scrape and gather treasures, By wares deceitfull, or false weights or measures. That Landlord is a Thiefe that rackes his rents, And mounts the price of rotten tenements, Almost vnto a damned double rate, And such a Thiefe as that One that eight yeeres since bought many houses, where I and many poore men dwelt, and presently raised our rents, from three pounds to fiue pounds, but I changed him quickly for a better., my selfe had late. A paire of louers, are starke Thieues, for they Doe kindly steale each others heart away. Extortioners, I Thieues may truly call, Who take more int'rest then the principall. Executors, and ouer-seers Thieuing, Haue often wrong'd the dead, and rob'd the liuing. All those within the ranke of Thieues must be, That trust their wares out from three months to three, And make their debtors thrice the worth to pay, Because they trust them, these are Thieues I say, That doe sell time, which vnto God belongs, And begger whom they trust most, with these wrongs. He is a Thiefe, and basely doth purloyne, Who borroweth of his neighbours goods, or coyne, And can, but will no satisfaction giue, These are the most notorious Thieues that liue: Vpon such Thieues (if Law the same allow'd) A hanging were exceeding well bestow'd. A Farmer is a Thiefe, that hoards vp graine In hope of dearth, by either drouth or raine, He steales Gods treasures, and doth quite forget, That ouer them hee's but a Steward set, And for this rob'ry he deserues to weare A riding knot an inch below his eare Of drinking Thieues exceeding store there are, That steale themselues drunke e're they be aware: These are right rob-pots, rob-wits, and rob-purses, To gaine diseases, begg'ry, and Gods curses. Drawers, and Tapsters too, are Thieues I thinke, That nick their pots, and cheat men of their drinke; And when guests haue their liquor in their braine, Steale pots halfe full, to fill them vp againe. Though this be Thieu'ry, yet I must confesse, 'Tis honest Theft to punish Drunkennesse. And of small Thieues, the Tapster I preferre, He is a Drunkards executioner, For whilest his money lasts, he much affects him, Then, with the rod of pouerty corrects him. A Chamberlaine vnto his guests may creepe, And pick their pockets, when th'are drunke asleepe: But amongst Thieues, that are of low repute, An Hostler is a Thiefe, most absolute: He with a candles end Horse teeth can grease, They shall eat neither hay, oates, beanes, or pease, Besides a hole ith Manger, and a Bag Hang'd vnderneath, may coozen many a Nag, And ipecially, if in a Stable darke, If one doe not the Hostlers knau'ry marke, He will deceiue a man, before his face, On the peck's bottome, some few oats hee'l place, Which seemes as if it to the brim were full, And thus the knaue both man and horse will gull. If he breake horse-bread, he can thus much doe, Amongst fiue loaues, his codpiece swallowes two: The Hostler sayes the horse hath one good tricke, Quicke at his meat, he needs must trauell quicke. If men, at full racke for their horse-meat pay, So hard into the racke hee'l tread the Hay, That out, the poore beasts cannot get a bit, And th'Hostler's held an honest man for it, For who would thinke the horses want their right, When as the racke is still full, day and night? With bottles, if men will haue horses fed, To each a groats-worth ere they goe to bed, The Thieuish Hostler can rob horse and men, And steale the bottles from the racke agen, And put in Hay that's pist vpon, I wot, Which being dry'd, no horse will eat a iot. And all such Hostlers, wheresoe'r they bee, Deserue a horses night-cap for their fee. One stole a wife, and married her in poast, A hanging had bin better stolne, almost: By her he night and day was long perplex'd, Cornuted, scolded at, defam'd, and vext, That (in comparison of all his paine) A friendly hanging had beene mighty gaine. There's an old speech, a Tayler is a Thiefe, And an old speech he hath for his reliefe, I'll not equiuocate, I'll giue him's due, He cannot steale truly, or truly he cannot steale.He (truly) steales not, or he steales not, true. Those that report so, mighty wrong doe doe him, For how can he steale that, that's brought vnto him? And it may be they were false idle speeches, That one brought Cotton once, to line his Breeches, And that the Tayler laid the Cotton by, And with old painted Cloth, the roome supply, Which as the owner (for his vse) did weare, A nayle or sceg, by chance his breech did teare, At which he saw the linings, and was wroth, For Diues and Lazarus on the painted Cloth, The Gluttons dogs, and hels fire hotly burning, With fiends and fleshhookes, whence ther's no returning. He rip'd the other breech, and there he spide The pamper'd Prodigall on cockhorse ride: There was his fare, his fidlers, and his whores, His being poore, and beaten out of doores, His keeping hogs, his eating huskes for meat, His lamentation, and his home retreat, His welcome to his father, and the feast, The fat calfe kill'd, all these things were exprest. These transformations fild the man with feare, That he hell fire within his breech This fellowes breeches were not lyn'd with Apocrypha. I heard of one that had the picture of the Deuill, in the backe linings of his Dublet, witnesse at the Swan in St. Martins. should beare, He mus'd what strange inchantments he had bin in, That turn'd his linings, into painted linnen. His feare was great, but at the last to rid it, A Wizard told him, 'twas the Tayler did it. One told me of a This miller kept a windmill not many yeeres since, at Purflet in Essex. miller that had power Sometimes to steale fiue bushels out of foure: As once a windmill (out of breath) lack'd winde, A fellow brought foure bushels there to grinde, And hearing neither noyse of knap or tiller, Laid downe his corne, and went to seeke the miller: Some two flight-shoot to th'Alehouse he did wag, And left his sacke in keeping with his Nag, The miller came a by-way vp the hill, And saw the sacke of corne stand at the mill, Perceiuing none that could his theft gaine-say, For toll tooke bagge and grist, and all away. And a crosse-way vnto the Alehouse hy'd him, Whereas the man that sought him, quickly spide him. Kind miller (quoth the man) I left but now A sacke of wheat, and I intreat that thou Wilt walke vp to the mill where it doth lye, And grinde it for me now the winde blowes hye. So vp the hill they went, and quickly found The bagge and corne, stolne from the ground vngroun'd. The poore man with his losse was full of griefe, He, and the miller went to seeke the Thiefe, Or else the corne: at last all tyr'd and sad, (Seeking both what he had not, and he had) The miller (to appease or ease his paine) Sold him one bushell Some say, that he sold him the foure bushels againe, and then stole one bushell for toll. of his owne againe. Thus out of foure the man fiue bushels lost, Accounting truely all his corne and cost. To mend all of this Thieuing millers brood, One halfe houres hanging would be very good. But there's a kind of stealing mysticall, Pick-pocket wits, filch lines Sophisticall, Villaines in verse, base runagates in rime, False rob-wits, and contemned slaues of time, Purloyning Thieues, that pilfer from desart The due of study, and reward of art. Pot Poets, that haue skill to steale translations, And (into English) filch strange tongues and Nations, And change the language of good wits vnknowne, These Thieuish Rascals print them for their owne. Mistake me not (good Reader) any wayes, Translators doe deserue respect and praise, For were it not for them, we could not haue A Bible, that declares our soules to saue, And many thousands worthy workes would lye Not vnderstood, or in obscurity, If they by learned mens intelligence, Were not translated with great diligence: I honour such, and he that doth not so, May his soule sinke to euerlasting woe. I speake of such as steale regard and fame, Who doe translate, and hide the Authors name, Or such as are so barren of inuention, That cannot write a line worth note, or mention, Yet vpon those that can, will belch their spite, And with malicious tongues their names backbite. To this effect I oft haue wrote before, And am inforced now this one time more, To take my pen againe into my fist, And answer a deprauing Emblemist; I spare to name him, but I tell him plaine, If e'r he dare abuse me so againe, I'll whip him with a yerking Satyres lash, Fang'd like th'inuectiue muse of famouse Nash; That he shall wish he had not beene, or beene Hang'd, e'r he mou'd my iust incensed spleene. He hath reported most maliciously, In sundry places amongst company, That I doe neither write, nor yet inuent The things, that (in my name) doe passe in print: But that some Scholler spends his time and braine, And lets me haue the glory and the gaine. Is any Poet in that low degree, To make his muse worke iourney-worke to me? Or are my lines with eloquence imbellish'd, As any learning in them may be relish'd? Those that thinke so, they either iudge in haste, Or else their iudgements pallat's out of taste. My pen in Helicon I ne'r did dip, And all my Schollership is Schullership, I am an English-man, and haue the scope To write in mine owne Countries speech (I hope) For Homer was a Grecian, and I note That all his workes in the Greeke tongue he wrote: Virgill, and Ouid, neither did contemne To vse that speech, their mothers taught to them. Du Bartas, Petrarcke, Tasso, all their muses Did vse the language that their country vses. And though I know but English, I suppose I haue as many tongues as some of those. Their studies were much better, yet I say, I vse my countries speech, and so did they. Because my name is Taylor, some doe doubt, My best inuention comes by stealing out From other Writers workes, but I reply, And giue their donbtfull diffidence the lye. To cloze this point I must be very briefe, And call them Knaues, that call me Poet Thiefe. But yet a Poets theft, I must not smother, For they doe often steale from one another: They call it borrowing, but I thinke it true, To tearme it stealing, were a style more due. There is a speech, that Poets still are poore, But ne'r till now I knew the cause wherefore: Which is, when their inuentions are at best. Then they are daily rob'd, 'tis manifest; For noble Thieues and poore Thieues all conioyne, From painfull Writers studies to purloyne, And steale their flashes, and their sparks of wit, Still vtt'ring them at all occasions fit, As if they were their owne, and these men are For their stolne stuffe esteemed wise and rare. They call it borrowing, but I tell them plaine, 'Tis stealing, for they neuer pay againe. The vse of money's eight i' th'hundred still, And men in Bonds bound, as the owner will; But wit and Poetry (more worth then treasure) Is from the owners borrowed, at mens pleasure, And to the Poets lot it still doth fall, To lose both interest and principall. This is the canse that Poets are poore men, Th'are rob'd, and lend, and ne'r are paid agen. 'Tis said that Iacob (counsel'd by his mother) Did steale his fathers blessing from his brother, This was a theft which few wil imitate, Their fathers blessings are of no such rate, For though some sonnes might haue them for the crauing, Yet they esteeme them scarcely worth the hauing. Their fathers money they would gladly steale, But for their blessings they regard no deale. And by their waters you may guesse and gather, That they were sicke and grieued of the Father: But on such Thieues as those, I plainly say, A hansome hanging were not cast away. Some Thieues may through an admirable skill, An honest Common-wealth both pole and pill: These fellowes steale secure as they were Millers, And are substantiall men, their Countries Pillers: Purloyning polers, or the Barbers rather, That shaue a Kingdome. cursed wealth to gather: These Pillers, or these Caterpillers swarmes, Grow rich, and purchase goods by others harmes, And liue like Fiends, extremely fear'd and hated; And are, and shall be euer execrated. A King of Britaine once Catellus He was the forryth King after Brute, and he raigned before Christs birth 171, yeeres nam'd, Vpon Record his Charity is fam'd: His iustice, and his memory was so ample, He hang'd vp all oppressours, for example. If that Law once againe were in request, Then, of all trades a Hangman were the best. These are the brood of Barrabas, and these Can rob, and be let loose againe at ease, Whilst Christ (in his poore members) euery day, Doth suffer (through their Theft) and pine away. And sure all men, of whatsoe'r degree, Of Science, Art, or Trade, or Mystery, Or Occupation, whatsoe'r they are, For truth cannot with Watermen compare. I know there's some obiections may be made, How they are rude, vnciuill in their trade: But that is not the question I propound, I say no Theft can in the trade be found; Our greatest foes by no meanes can reueale, Which way we can deceiue, or cheat, or steale: We take men in, and Land them at their pleasure, And neuer bate them halfe an inch of measure; Still at one price our selues we waste and weare, Though all things else be mounted double deare: And in a word, I must conclude and say, The Anagram of Water-man is, A TREW MAN.A Waterman can be a Thiefe no way: Except one way, which I had halfe forgot, He now and then perhaps may rob the pot, Steale himselfe drunke, and be his owne Purspicker, And chimically turnes his coyne to liquor. This is almost a vniuersall Theft, A portion Fathers to their Sonnes haue left: Men are begot, and doe like their begetters, And Watermen doe learne it of their betters. Ther's nothing that doth make them poore &amp; bare, but b'cause they are such true men as they are: For if they would but steale like other men, The Gallowes would deuoure them now and then; Whereby their number quickly would be lesse, Which (to their wants) would be a good redresse. Their pouerty doth from their truth proceed, Their way to thriue were to be Thieues indeed: If they would steale, and hang, as others doe, Those that suruiue it were a helpe vnto; Truth is their trade, &amp; truth doth keepe them poore, But if their truth were lesse, their wealth were more, All sorts of men, worke all the meanes they can, To make a Thiefe of euery Water-man: And as it were in one consent they ioyne, To trot by land i'th' dirt, and saue their coine. Carroaches, Coaches, Iades and Flanders Mares, Doe rob vs of our shares, our wares, our Fares: Against the ground we stand and knocke our heeles, Whilest all our profit runs away on wheeles; And whosoeuer but obserues and notes, The great increase of Coaches and of Boates, Shall finde their number more then e'r they were By halfe and more within these thirty yeeres. Then Water-men at Sea had seruice still, And those that staid at home had worke at will: Then vpstart Helcart-Coaehes were to seeke, A man could scarce see twenty in a weeke, But now I thinke a man may daily see, More then the Whirries on the Thames can be. When Queene Elizabeth came to the Crowne, A Coach in England then was scarcely knowne, Then 'twas as rare to see one, as to spy A Tradesman that had neuer told a lye: But now, like plagues of Egypt, they doe swarme, As thicke as Frogs, or Lice, vnto our harme. For though the King, the Counsell, and such States As are of high superiour rankes and rates, For port or pleasure, may their Coaches haue, Yet 'tis not fit that euery Whore or Knaue, And fulsome Madams, and new scuruy Squires, Should iolt the streets in pomp, at their desires, Like great triumphant Tamberlaines, each day, Drawne with the pamper'd Iades of Belgia, That almost all the streets are choak'd out-right, Where men can hardly passe, from morne till night. Whilest Watermen want worke, and are at ease, To carry one another, if they please, Or else sit still, and poorely starue and dye; For all their liuings on foure Wheeles doe flye. Good Reader thinke it not too long, or much, That I thus amply on this point doe tutch: Now we are borne, we would our worke apply To labour, and to liue vntill we dye; And we could liue well, but for Coaches thieuing, That euery day doe rob vs of our liuing. If we, by any meanes, could learne the skill, To rob the Coachmen, as they rob vs still; Then in the Sessions booke it would appeare, They would be hang'd fiue hundred in a yeare. Besides, it is too manifestly knowne, They haue the Sadlers trade almost o'rthrowne: And the best Leather in our Kingdome they Consume and waste; for which poore men do pay: Our Bootes &amp; Shooes to such high price they reare, That all our profit can buy none to weare. I in Bohemia saw that all but Lords, Or men of worth, had Coaches drawne with cords: And I my necke vnto the rope would pawne, That if our Hackney ratlers were so drawne, With cords, or ropes, or halters, chuse ye whether, It quickly would bring downe the price of Leather. The Watermen should haue more worke I hope, When euery hireling Coach drawne with a rope, Would make our Gallants stomacke at the matter, And now and then to spend their coyne by water. Without all flattery, here my minde I breake, The Prouerb saies, Giue loosers leaue to speake: They carry all our Fares, and make vs poore, That to our Boates we scarce can get a The Wherries were wont to haue all the Whores, till the Coaches robd them of their custome. Whore. Some honest men and women now and then Will spend their moneyes amongst Watermen: But we are growne so many, and againe, Our fares so few, that little is our gaine. Yet for all this (to giue the Diuell his due) Our honest trade can no wayes be vntrue. If some be rude amongst the multitude, 'Tis onely want of worke that makes them rude: 'Tis want of money, and of manners too, That makes them doe as too too oft they doo: And euery good thing that in them is scant, It still must be imputed to their want. But leauing true men, I must turne my stile To paltry Thieues, whose glory is their guile: For thrice three hundred of them from me tooke, Some of them ready money, some a Booke, And set their hands to Bils, to pay to me, When I from Scotland should returned be. Crownes, pounds, or Angels, what they pleas'd to write, I haue their fists to shew in blacke and white. And after that, I to Bohemia went, And gaue out money, and much money spent: And for these things, those Thieues in generall, Will neither giue me gaine or Principall. I lately wrote a It is cald a Kicksie winsie, or a Lerry cum twang. Pamphlet to the Crue, That spake their due, for keeping of my due: Wherein I gaue them thankes that had me paid, And pardon'd those that in their graues were laid: To those that were exceeding poore, or fled, (Except good words) I very little sed; I praid for them that onely would and could not, And I inueigh'd at those that could and would not. And let those shifters their owne Iudges be, If they haue not bin arrant Thieues to me; For first and last they tooke (with their good wils) Neere fifteene hundred Bookes vpon their bils, And all their hands (if I the truth may vtter) Are worse then obligations seald with butter: For I haue in my store (not worth a Louse) As many Bils as well may thatch a House; And there I haue the hands of Knights and Squires: And Omnium gatherum cheating knaues and lyers, Seuen hundred in a Galley mawfrey, Close, Which I would sell for fifteene pence the Groce: They'l neither pay with c?ming, nor with sending, And are (like old Boots) past all hope of mending. First they did rob me of my expectation, And made me walke a long perambulation: And as my To whom I in all humility must euer acknowledge my obedience and dutifull thankfulnesse and seruice. Royall Master, when I came, The good Prince, and my Lord of Buckingham With many more of honour, worship, and Men of inferiour callings in this Land, Were bountifull to me at my returne; Yet I like one that doth one Candle burne In seeking of another, spent their gifts To finde out sharkes, and complements, and shifts. Theft is the best name I can giue their crime, They rob me of my Bookes, my coine, and time, Of others bounty, and mine owne good hopes; And for this Theft I leaue them to the Ropes. I speake to those that can and will not pay, When in the streets I meete them euery day, They doe not much mistake, if they doe thinke I wish them I haue 700. Bils of their hands, which in all comes to neere 300. 1. hang'd for keeping of my chinke. Thus haue touch'd a crue of Thieuing fellowes, That rob beyond the compasse of the Gallowes: Whilest many little Thieues are hang'd vp dead, That onely steale for need, to finde them bread: As Pharaoh's fat Kine did the leane deuoure, So great Thieues swallow small ones by their pow'r. And sure I thinke that common Burglaries. Pick-pockets, Highway-Thieues, and Pilferies, And all that thus felloniously doe Thieue, Are Thieues whose labours The trade of Thieuing is very profitable to many men. many doe relieue. Who but poore Thieues doe Iaylors wants supply? On whom doe Vnder-Keepers still rely? From Thieuing, money still is gotten thus, For many a Warrant and a Mittimus; And if men were not apt to filch and Thieue, 'Twere worse for many a high and vnder Shrieue. The Halter-maker, and the Smith are getters, For fatall twist, and pondrous bolts and fetters. The Carman hath a share amongst the rest, Although not voluntary, yet hee's prest. The Ballad-maker doth some profit reape, And makes a Tiburne Dirge exceeding cheape, The whil'st the Printers, and the dolefull Singers, Doe in these gainfull businesse dip their fingers. The very Hangman hath the sleight and skill, To extract all his goods from others ill; He is the Epilogue vnto the Law, And from the iawes of death his life doth draw. And last, the Hangmans Broaker reapes the fruit, By selling to one Thiefe anothers suit. Besides, Thieues are fit members: for 'tis knowne, They make men carefull how to keepe their owne; For were it not for them, we still should lye Rock'd in the Cradle of security: Lull'd in base idlenesse, and sluggish sloth, Apt to all ill, and to all goodnesse loth: Which would infect vs, and corrupt the bloud, And therefore for our healths sake Theeues are good. And some men are so prone to steale, I thinke, It is as nat'rall as their meate and drinke, They are borne to't, and cannot doe withall, And must be filching still, what e'r befall. A wispe of rushes, or a clod of land, Or any wadde of hay that's next to hand They'l steale, and for it haue a good excuse; They doe't to keepe their hands in vre, or vse: But not t'excuse a Thiefe in any case; I say there are some crimes as void of grace, On whom men scarce haue feeling or a thought, Nor e'r like Thieues are to the Gallowes brought. Those that obey false gods, commit offence Against th'Eternall Gods Omnipotence. Those that doe grauen Images adore, Are worse then Thieues, yet are not hang'd therfore; Tis treason high to take Gods name in vaine, Yet most men do't, through frailty, or for gaine. The Sabbath is prophan'd continually, Whilest the offenders pay small Or none at all. penalty. And Parents are dishonour'd, without awe, The whilest the children doe escape the law: And murther, though't be ne'r so foule and deadly, Is oft times made man-slaughter or chance-medley. Adultery's neighbourhood, and fornication, May be conniu'd at, with a toleration. A Witnesse, that false testimony beares, 'Tis a great wonder if he lose his eares. But sure the Prouerbe is as true as briefe, A Lyer's euer worser then a Thiefe, And 'tis call'd Thrift, when men their minds doe set, To couet how their Neighbours goods to get. To be vaine-glorious, and ambitious proud, Are Gentleman-like parts, must be allow'd. To beare an Enuy, base and secretly, 'Tis counted Wisedome, and great Policy. To be a Drunkard, and the Cat to whip, Is call'd the King of all good Fellowship. But for a Thiefe, the whole world doth consent, That hanging is the fittest punishment. But if that Law were put in execution, I thinke it would be Man-kindes dissolution: And then we should haue Land and Tenements For nothing, or for very easie Rents: Whereby we see that man his wealth esteemes, And better then his God, his soule it deemes: For let God be abusde, and let his soule Runne greedily into offences soule, He scarcely shall be question'd for't, but if (Amongst his other sinnes) he play the Thiefe. And steale mens goods, they all will sentence giue, He must be hang'd, he is vnfit to liue. In the Low Countryes, if a wretch doe steale But bread, or meat, to feed himselfe a meale, They will vnmercifully beat and clowt him, Hale, pull, and teare, &amp; spurne, &amp; kicke, &amp; flowt him. But if a Drunkard be vnpledg'd a Kan, Drawes out his knife and basely stabs a man, To runne away the Rascall shall haue scope, None holds him, but all cry, Run, Thiefe, Run. Lope Scellum Lope. Thus there's a close conniuence for all vice, Except for Theft, and that's a hanging price. One man's addicted to blaspheme and sweare, A second to carowse, and domineere: A third to whoring, and a fourth to fight, And kill and slay, a fist man to backbite, A sixt and seuenth, with this or that crime caught, And all in generall much worse then naught, And amongst all these sinners generall, The Thiefe must winne the halter from them all, When if the matter should examin'd be, They doe deserue it all, as much as he. Nor yet, is Thieuery any vpstart sinne, But it of long antiquity hath bin: And by this trade great men haue not disdain'd, To winne renowne, and haue their states maintain'd. Great Alexanders conquests, what were they But taking others goods and lands away? (In manners) I must call it Martiall dealing, But truth will terme it rob'ry, and flat stealing, For vnto all the world it is well knowne, That he by force, tooke what was not his owne. Some Writers are with Tamberlaine so briefe, To stile him with the name of Seythian Thiefe. Plutarch. Licurgus lou'd, and granted gifts beside To Thieues that could steale, and escape vnspide: But if they taken with the manner were, They must restore, and buy the bargaine deere. Thieues were at all times euer to be had, Examples by the good Thiefe and the bad. And England still hath bin a fruitfull Land Of valiant Thieues, that durst bid true men stand. One Bellin Dun Hen. 1., a famous Thiefe suruiu'd, From whom the cowne of Dunstable's deriu'd: And Robin Hood Rich. 2. with little Iohn agreed To rob the rich men, and the poore to feede. Edw. 3.The Priests had here such small meanes for their liuing, That many of them were enforc'd to Thieuing. Once the fist Henry could rob ex'lent well, When he was Prince of Wales, as Stories tell. Then Fryer Tucke a tall stout Thiefe indeed, Could better rob and steale, then preach or read. Sir Gosselin Deinuill, Edw. 2. with 200. more, In Fryers weedes, rob'd and were hang'd therefore. Thus I in Stories, and by proofe doe finde, That stealing's very old, time out of minde, E'r I was borne, it through the world was spred, And will be when I from the world am dead. But leauing thus, my Muse in hand hath tooke, To shew which way a Thiefe is like a Booke. A Comparison betweene a Thiefe and a Booke. Comparisons are odious, as some say, But my comparisons are so no way: I in the Pamphlet which I wrote before, Compar'd a Booke most fitly to a Whore: And now, as fitly my poore muse alludes, A Thiefe t'a Booke in apt similitudes. A good Booke steales the mind from vaine pretences, From wicked cogitations, and offences: It makes vs know the worlds deceiuing pleasures, And set our hearts on neuer ending treasures. So when Thieues steale our Cattle, Coyne or Ware, It makes vs see how mutable they are: Puts vs in mind that wee should put our trust, Where Fellon cannot steale, or Canker rust. Bad Bookes through eyes and eares doe breake and enter, And takes possession of the hearts fraile Center. Infecting all the little Kingdome Man, With all the poys'nous mischiefe that they can, Till they haue rob'd and ransack'd him of all Those things which men may iustly goodnesse call. Robs him of vertue, and of heau'nly grace, And leaues him begger'd, in a wretched case. So of our earthly goods, Thieues steale the best, And richest iewels, and leaue vs the rest. Men know not Thieues from true men by their looks, Nor by their outsides, no man can know Bookes. Both are to be suspected, all can tell, And wisemen e'r they trust, will try them well. A Booke may haue a title good and faire, Though in it one may finde small goodnesse there: And so a Thiefe, whose actions are most vile, Steales good opinion, and a true mans stile. Some Bookes (prophane) the Sacred text abuse, With common Thieues it is a common vse. Some Bookes are full of lyes, and Thieues are so, One hardly can beleeue their yea, or no. Some Bookes are scurrilous and too obsceane, And he's no right Thiefe that loues not a Queane. Some Book's not worth the reading for their fruits: Some Thieues not worth the hanging, for their suits, Some Bookes are briefe, and in few words declare Compendious matter, and acutenesse rare: And so some Thieues will breake into a house, Or cut a purse whilest one can cracke a Louse. Some Bookes are arrogant and impudent, So are most Thieues in Christendome and Kent. Some Bookes are plaine and simple, and some Thieues Are simply hang'd, whilest others get reprieues. Some Books like foolish Thieues, their faults are spide Some Thieues like witty Bookes, their faults can hide: Some Bookes are quaint and quicke in their conceits, Some Thieues are actiue, nimble in their sleights. Some Bookes with idle stuffe the Author fills, Some Thieues will still be idle by their wills. Some Bookes haue neither reason, law, or sense, No more haue any Thieues for their offence. A Booke's but one, when first it comes to th'Presse, It may increase to numbers numberlesse: And so one Thiefe perhaps may make threescore: And that threescore may make ten thousand more, Thus from one Thiefe, Thieues may at last amount, Like Bookes from one Bookes past all mens account. And as with industry, and art, and skill, One Thiefe doth daly rob another still, So one Booke from another (in this age) Steales many a line, a sentence or a page. Thus amongst Bookes, good fellowship I finde, All things are common, Thieues beare no such mind, And for this Thieuing, Bookes with hue and cry Are sought, (as Thieues are) for their Fellony. As Thieues are chasde and sent from place to place, So Bookes are alwaies in continuall chase. As Bookes are strongly boss'd, and clasp'd &amp; bound, So Thieues are manacled, when they are found: As Thieues are oft examin'd for their crimes, So Bookes are vsde, and haue bin at all times. As Thieues haue oft at their arraignment stood, So Bookes are tryde if they be bad or good. As Iuries and Graund Iuries, with much strife, Giue vp (for Thieues) a Verdict, death or life. So as mens fancies euidence doe giue, The shame or fame of Bookes, to dye or liue: And as the veriest Thiefe may haue some friend, So the worst Bookes, some Knaue will still defend. As Thieues their condemnation must abide, Bookes are deem'd true sometimes, sometimes bely'd. As Thieues are iudged, so haue Bookes agen, As many censures (almost) as are men. And as their faults are different in degree, Some Thieues are hang'd, some Books are burnt we see. Some Thieues are for their small offences whip't, All Bookes are prest, except a Manuscript. As Thieues are buryed, when the Law is paid, So some Bookes in obliuions graue are laid. The Ialors keepe the Thieues, and much regards, The strength of fetters, locks, bolts, grates &amp; wards. And will know when and how abroad they goe, And vnto Bookes the Stationers are so Still Bookes and Thieues in one conceit doe ioyne: For, if you marke them, they are all for coyne. Some Thieues exceeding braue, a man may finde In Sattin, and their cloakes with veluet linde: And some Bookes haue gay coats vnto their backs, When as their insides, goods and goodnesse lacks. Some Bookes are all betatterd, torne and rent, Some Thieues endure a ragged punishment. Some Thieues may come (their sorrows to increase) Before a shallow Officer of peace, One that can cough, call knaue, and with non-sense Commit, before he know for what offence: A Booke somtimes doth proue a Thiefes true friend, And doth preserue him from a hanging end: For let a man at any Sessions looke, And still some Thieues are saued by their Booke. And so some Bookes to coxcombs hands may come, Who can cry pish, and mew, and tush, and hum, Condemne ere they haue read, or throughly scand, Abusing what they cannot vnderstand. Some Thieues are like a Horne-booke, and begin Their A.B.C. of filching, with a pin; Their Primmer is a poynt, and then their Psalter May picke a pocket, and come neere a Halter. Then with long practice in these rudiments, To breake a house may be his Accidence, And vsing of his skill (thus day by day) By Grammar he may rob vpon the way, Vntill at last, to weare (it be his hap) A Tiburne Tippet, or old Stories Cap. That is the high'st degree which they can take, An end to all their studies there they make: For amongst Thieues not one amongst a score, If they be rais'd so high, they'l steale no more. Thus the comparisons hold still you see, To Whores and Thieues, Bookes may compared bee. All are like Actors, in this wauering age, They enter all vpon the worlds great Stage: Some gaine applause, and some doe act amisse, And exit from the scaffold with a hisse. Now if my Whore or Thiefe play well their parts, Giue them their due, applaud their good deserts. If ill, to Newgate hisse them, or Bridewell, To any place, Hull, Halifax or Hell. And thus the Thiefe and Booke ioyne both in one; Both hauing made an END, they both haue DON. THE PRAISE AND VERTVE OF a JAYLE and JAYLERS: WITH THE MOST EXCELLENT MYSTERIE, and necessary vse of all sorts of Hanging. ALSO A TOVCH AT Tybvrne FOR A PERIOD, AND THE Avthors FREE LEAVE TO LET THEM be hangd, who are offended at the Booke without cause. Dedicated To the Reader, you must note, that this Gentleman did send me from the Fairne Iland, a barrell of Gulls and Cormorant egges, by the eating of which, I haue attained to the vnderstanding of many words which our Gulls and Cormorants doe speaks here about London. Sensible, Reasonable, Affable, Amiable, Acceptable, minded, Honourable, in VVit, Iudgement, and Vnderstanding Able, Robert Rugge Gentleman, Reare Adelantado of the Holy Iland, the Fairne, and the Staples, on the Coast of Northumbria. No hanging Tap'strie, Quilt, or Couerlet, This dedication of my wit could get: No Mattresse, Blanket, Sheet, or Featherbed, Could haue these labours of my working head: But (cold by nature) from my Nurses dugge, My inclination still hath lou'd a Rugge: Which makes my thankefull Muse thus bold to be, To consecrate this worthlesse worth to thee: Thou that within those happy Iles doest bide, Which Neptunes waues doe from our Land diuide, Where in the Holy Iland stands a Fort That can defend, and iniuries retort: That doth command a goodly Hauen nigh, Wherein a hundred ships may safely lye: Thou in the The Fairne Iland standing 7. miles from the Holy Iland into the Sea, the Holy Iland stands seuen miles from Barwicke. In the Fairne all sorts of Sea-fowle breed in such abundance, as you cannot step but vpon Egges or Fowle: They misse not to lay on Saint Markes day, and a fortnight after Lammas there is none to be seene. The Staple Ilands belong to the Fairne, and stand two miles from it into the Sea, where the Fowle vpon the rockes (like pinacles) are so thicke both vpon the sides, and vpon the tops, and with such curiosity build their nests, as the wit of man cannot lay that egge in his place againe that is once taken vp, to abide in the same place. Vpon their flight the Sea is couered for halfe a mile, and the heauens aboue head obscured for the present. Fairne and Staples bearst such sway, That all the dwellers there doe thee obey: Where Fowle are all thy faire inhabitants, Where thou (Commander of the Cormorants) Grand Gouernour of Guls, of Geese and Ganders, O'r whom thou art none of the least Commanders: Whereas sometimes thou canst not stirre thy legs, But thou must tread on tributary egs: For they like honest, true, plaine-dealing folkes, Pay thee the custome of their whites and yolkes, Which to thy friends oft-times transported be, As late thou sentst a barrell-full to me: And in requitall to so good a friend, This Prison, and this Hanging here I send. Because within the There is but one house there, all the dwellers else being Sea-fowle, vvho will neither know offences nor punishments. Fairne and Staples too, The dwellers doe as they doe please to doe Their pride and lust, their stealing and their treason, Is all imputed to their want of reason: I therefore haue made bold to send thee this, To shew them what a Iayle and Hanging is. Thou hast from Hermes suck'd the Quintessence Of quicke Inuention, and of Eloquence: And thou so well doest loue good wittie Bookes, That makes thee like Apollo in thy lookes: For nature hath thy visage so much grac'd, That there's the ensigne of true friendship plac'd. A chaulkie face, that's like a pewter spoone, Or buttermilke, or greene cheese, or the moone, Are either such as kill themselues with care, Or hide-bound miserable wretches are. Giue me the man, whose colour and prospect, Like Titan when it doth on gold reflect; And if his purse be equall to his will, Hee'l then be frolicke, free, and iouiall still: And such a one (my worthy friend) art thou, To whom I dedicate this Pamphlet now; And I implore the Heau'ns to proue so kinde, To keepe thy state according to thy minde. Yours with my best wishes, Iohn Taylor. THE VERTVE OF A IAYLE, AND NECESSITIE OF HANGING. My free-borne Muse of bondage rudely treats, And strange vagaries in my Brain-pan beats: Whilst I vnmaske, vnuisor, or vnueile The vertues of a Iaylor and a Iayle: And then of Hanging, and the Hang-mans art My lines doe end, and at the Gallowes part: First, I doe finde in Histories enrold, Iayles for antiquity, are very old: For Ioseph was in prison (false accus'd, That he his Masters Wife would haue abus'd.) And all the world doth vnderstand, a Prison Is not an vpstart Fable newly risen. And Ieremie was vnder bolts and locks, By Pashur once imprison'd in the Ier. 22.2. stocks: And after that he twice was put in Chap. 32. thrall, For true foretelling Chap. 37. Israel, Iudah's fall. The Sacred Histories doe well declare, That Prisons for their time most ancient are. Yet though my lines doe speake of Iayles, I see That mine inuention and my Muse is free: And I doe finde the name of Prisone, frames Significant alluding Anagrams. As thus. 1. Prisone. Anagramma. Nip Sore. There men are Nip'd with mischiefes manifold, With losse of freedome, hunger, thirst, &amp; cold, With mourning shirts, and sheets, &amp; lice some store, And thus a Prison truely doth Nip sore. 2. Prisone. Anagramma. In Ropes. Againe the very word portends small hopes, For he that's in a Prisone, is In Ropes. 3. Prisone Anagramma. In Prose. To all good verses, Prisons are great foes, And many Poets they keepe fast In Prose. 4. Prisone. Anagramma. No Prise. In deed it is no profit, or No Prise, But woefull purchase of calamities. The name of Iayles (by letters transposition) Doth very well discouer their condition. 5. Iayles. Anagramma. I Slaye. And well it doth befit it euery way, The nature of all Iayles is still to slay: There are men slaine most strange torm?ting waies, In name, fame, state, and life, with long delayes. 6. Bondage. Anagramma. Bandoge. And Bondage like a Bandogge still doth gnaw, Fangd with the tushes of the byting law. 7. Iayler. Anagramma. I Rayle. This doth befit the Iayler wondrous trimme, He at the prisoners railes, and they at him. 8. Aresting. Anagramma. A Stinger. A Resting very well with this agrees, It is A Stinger worse then Wasps or Bees. OR, 9. Aresting. Anagramma. In Grates. This very word includes poore prisoners fates, Aresting briefly claps em vp In Grates. 10. Serieant Anagramma. In Areste. To turne this word vnto the very best, A Serieant In Areste doth breed vnrest. OR, 11. Serieant. Anagramma. In Teares. In cares and Teares he leaues men to lament, When credit, coyne, and goods, and all are spent. 12. Wardes. Anagramma. Drawes. A prisoners purse is like a nurse, for why, His Ward or lodging drawes or sucks it dry: A Iury here of Anagrams, you see, Of Serieants and of Iailes empanneld be; And now my pen intends to walke a station, And talke of Prisons in some other fashion. That Iailes should be, there is Law, sense and reason, To punish bawdry, cheating, theft and treason, Though some against them haue inuective bin, And call'd a Iaile a magazin of sin, An Vniuersitie of villany, An Academy of foule blasphemy, A sinke of drunkennesse, a den of Thieues, A treasury for Serieants and for Shrieues, A mint for Baylifes, Marshals men and Iailers, Who liue by losses of captiu'd bewailers: A nurse of Roguery, and an earthly hell, Where Deu'ls or Iaylers in mens shapes doe dwell: But I am quite contrary to all this, I thinke a Iaile a Schoole of vertue is, A house of study and of contemplation, A place of discipline and reformation, There men may try their patience and shall know, If they haue any friends aliue or no: There they shall proue if they haue fortitude, By which all crosses stoutly are subdu'd. A Prison leades the creditor vnto His coozning debter, that would him vndoe, 'Tis physicke that preserues the Common-wealth, Foule treasons snaffle, and the curbe of stealth, The whip of hellish pride, the scourge of lust, The goodmans helpe in plaguing the vniust. Were thieues and villaines not in prison put, A world of throats (past number) would be cut: For when diseases are growne desperate, then They must haue desperate remedies, and when Men mend not for repoofe, or admonition, A Iaile then is the Surgeon or Physician. The roaring Knaue, that like a horse or mule, His parents, master, or no friends could rule. But that he daily would be drunke and sweare, And like a demy-deuill domineere, Though to good course he neuer meant to bend him, A Excellent reformation. prison at the last will mend or end him. The deeds of darknesse that doe hate the light, Frays, brawls &amp; bloudshed which start out by night, The watch like cunning Fowlers lye in wait, And catch these Woodcocks in their Sprindges strait, These Birds are in the Iaile mew'd vp from riot, Where they may learn more manners and be quiet. A Iail's a glasse wherein old men may see, The blemish of their youths deformity; And yong men quickly may perceiue from thence, The way to wisdome and experience. And though the lights of prisons are but dim, A prisoners candle yet may shew to him At midnight, without light of Sunne or Moone. More then he euer could perceiue at noone; It shewes the fleeting state of earthly pelfe, It makes him wisely learne to know himselfe, The world vnto his view it represents, To be a map or masse of discontents, It shewes his fained friends like butter-flyes, That dogg'd his summer of prosperities: And in a word it truly doth set forth The world, and all that's in it nothing worth. These things vnto a wisemans iudgement brings, A hate to earth, and loue to heauenly things. T'a wise man nothing in a Iaile doth bide, But it to some good vse may be applide: He heares a Ruffin sweare, and so doth heare That he doth stand in feare, and hate to sweare: He spies another drunke, and so doth spy That such vnmanly beastlinesse hee'l fly. He notes the curtall cannes halfe fild with froth, Tobacco piping hot, and from them both His iudgement doth discerne, with wisdomes eye, The world is vapour, froth, and vanity. His homely There are too few that make this good vse of imprisonment. bed and vermines sundry formes, Doe make him mind his graue, &amp; crawling wormes; The Spiders cobweb, lawne, or tapestry, Shew odds 'twixt idlenesse and industry. The churlish keepers, rattling chaines and fetters, The hole or dungeon for condemned debters, Blaspheming wretches of all grace bereauen, Doe make him thinke on hell, and wish for heauen. And thus though wise mens corps in prison bee, Their minds are still at liberty and free. Besides, experience daily teacheth this, The soule a Prisoner in the body is: Our Reason should the keeper be to guide, The Heart doth lodge within the Masters side, The Braines the Knights ward may be termed fit, There lies the vnderstanding and the wit: The Dungeons where the Prisoners starue and dye, Is in the Brest where sad despaire doth lye: Our Sinnes the Manacles, and Bolts, and Giues, Which fetter vs in bondage all our liues: Sad melancholy sorrow, griefe and care, Continuall waiters in those Prisons are, Our partiall selfe-loue all our crimes excusing, Our Consciences true euidence accusing, Our sighs and teates the Messengers we send To God, that all our sorrowes may haue end; And then through faith and hope we doe beleeue, To gaine a pardon, better than repreeue; Then lastly, death doth free the soule from thrall, And makes a Iaile delivery vnto all. Thus is our flesh the wals, our bones the grates, Our eyes the windowes, and our mouthes the gates; The Nose the Chimney, Kitchen is the brest, Our Or Stomacke. tongue the taster of the worst and best, Our hands the Caruers, teeth the Cookes to mince, The diet of a Peasant or a Prince: Our hunger is best sawce, as I doe thinke, Our bellies cellers where we lay our drinke: And in these corps of ours deciphered thus, Our soules are prisoners vnto all of vs. As grace guides vs, so we by grace guide them, The way vnto the new Ierusalem. Sterne rugged winter, with frosts, stormes and gusts, Close prisoners yeerely in the The earth a Prison. earth it thrusts, Herbs, roots, flowers, fruits, &amp; worms til sun &amp; raine, With Summers heat doth baile them forth againe. But of all men aliue, I find A strait suit is a Tailors Prison. a Tailor Is an approued artificiall Iailor: Some doe commit themselues vnto his charge, And may, but will by no meanes goe at large. I haue seene many in the Taylors Iaies, Haue labour'd till they sweat with tooth and nailes, (The whilst a man might ride fiue miles at least) To get their clothes together on the brest, And being then in prison button'd vp, So close, that scarcely they could bite or sup, Yet I haue heard their pride how loud it lide, Protesting that their clothes were made too wide. These men loue bondage more then liberty, And 'tis a gallant kinde of foolery, When thus amongst themselues they haue a Law, To decke and dawbe the backe, and pinch the Maw. Me thinkes their soules should be in mighty trouble, Poore Animals, they are imprison'd double, In Corps and Clothes, and which is true and plaine, They seeme to take great pleasure in their paine. A Shoomakers Prison.A Shoomaker's a kind of Iailor too, And very strange exploits he dares to doe: For many times he hath the power and might, To clap into his Stocks a Lord or Knight, The Madam and the Maid he cares not whether, He laies them all fast by the heeles in lether. Plaine Truth and honesty prisoners. Honesty and Truth, both Prisoners are, Although they seldome come vnto the barre, Yet are they kept so closely day and night, That in an age they scarsely come in sight. And but for many of our Countries pillers, True Tailers, Weauers, and cleane finger d Millers, Good Serieants and kind Brokers did releeue them, A hard case.I know not who would any comfort giue them. No doubt but many a Lasse that faine would wed, Is her owne A maidenhead oftentimes is a Prisoner. Iailor to her maidenhead, With much vnwillingnesse she keepes it close, And with her heart she'l gladly let it lose. But looke to't wenches, if you giue it scope, 'Tis gone past all recouery, past all hope; Much like old Time which ceaselesse doth run on, But neuer doth returne, once being gone. The The Gowt a prisoner of State. Gowt's a sawcy Prisoner, and will haue His keepers to maintaine him fine and braue; His Iailors shall no needy beggers be, But men of honour and of high degree, And ouer them he beares such great command, That many times they can nor goe, nor stand; And if he would breake Iaile and flie; 'tis thought He by his keepers neuer should be sought. And Money a close Prisoner. money is close Prisoner I thinke sure, Where no man can its liberty procure: The Diuels Stewards and his Bailifes vow, That monies freedome they will not allow, Vnlesse vnto a Miser or a Whore, But by all meane fast hold it from the poore. I wish Amen Coine were as painfull as the Gout, To those that hoard it; and I make no doubt But miserable Pailers would agree To ope their Prisons, and let money flee, And were it not a lamentable thing, That some great Emperour or some mighty King Should be imprison'd by a vassall slaue, And lodg'd aliue (as twere within his Graue.) Such is the case of Siluer and of Gold, The chiefest of all mettals fast in hold, And darknesse lies held in the Misers stocks, Gold and Siluer kept in bondage by Iron.In steele and iron bars, and bolts and locks. Though gold and siluer royall mettals be, Yet are they slaues to yron, at we see. But leauing Gold and Gowr, Ile turne my pen, To what I haue digrest from Iayles and men: Let man examine well himselfe, and he Shall find himselfe his Most men are their owne greatest enemie; And that his losse of liberty and pelfe, He can accuse non for it, but himselfe: How passions, actions, and affections cluster, And how to ruinate his state they muster, His frailty armes his members and his senses, To vndertake most dangerous pretences. The backe oft tempts him vnto borrowed brauery, And all his body suffers for't in slauery; His Belly tempts him to superfluous fare, For which his cops lyes in a Iaylors snare; His Eyes from beauty to his heart drawes lust, For which he's often into prison thrust; His Eares giue credit to a knaue or theefe, And's body suffers for his eares beleefe. His Tongue much like a Hackney goes all paces, In City, Country, Court and Campe, all places, It gallops and false gallops, trots and ambles. One pace or other still it runnes and rambles: Of Kings and Princes states it often prattles, Of Church and Common-wealth it idly tattles, Of passing of it's word and suretiships, For which at last the Iayle the carkasse nips. Mans Hands haue very oft against him warr'd, And made him of his liberty debarr'd: A stab, a blow, a dashing of a pen, Hath clap'd him closely in the Iaylors den. The Feet which on the ground men daily tread, The way to their captiuity doe lead. Now for the inward faculties, I find Some lye in Prison for their haughty mind, Some for their folly, some because too wise, Are mew'd vp in the Iaylors custodies; Some for much gaming, or for recreation, Doe make a Iayle their homely habitation; And thus it plainly may be proued well, Mans greatest foes within himselfe doe dwell. And now two contraries I will compare, To shew how like, and how vnlike they are: A Iayle, our birth, our death, and setting free, These foure doe all agree and disagree; For all degrees, our birth and life we know Is naturall, Wee are all borne im one forme, and come into the world of one fashion, but wee dye and leaue the world infinite wayes. one way, for high and low: But death hath many thousand wayes and snares, To take our liues away all vnawares. And therefore of our liues it is no doubt, That ther's but one way in, and many out; But to a Iayle there's many waies to win, Ten thousand tricks and sleights to clap men in: And ther's but one way out as I doe know, Which is by satisfying what we owe. O west thou the Law thy life, dispatch and pay, And from the Prison thou art freed away: Dost thou owe mony, quickly pay thy score, And farewell, goe thy wayes man, there's the dore. As men in all that's ill, are Satans Apes, So sundry sinnes bring death in sundry shapes; Life from the God of life, which is but one, To all degrees one way giues life alone. And so our seuerall frailties, seuerall waies Our wretched Carkasses in prison layes, But there's but one way out that e'r I saw, Which is by satisfying of the law. The faults we doe in spring-time of our youth, In Summer of our man-hood gather growth: Then Haruests middle age doth make them ripe, Which winters old age doth in prison gripe; And thus the very seasons of the yeare, Fit emblemes of our thraldome doe appeare. In London and within a mile, I weene, There are of Iayles or Prisons full eighteene, And sixty Whipping-posts, and Stocks and Cages, Where sin with shame and sorrow hath due wages. For though the The Tower. Tower be a Castle Royall, Yet ther's a Prison in't for men disloyall: Though for defence a Campe may there be fitted, Yet for offence, men thither are committed. It is a house of fame, and there is in't A Palace for a Prince, a Royall Mint, Besides Poleaxes, Partizans, Halberts, Iauelins, Battleaxes, Crosbowes, halfe Pikes, Pistoles, and Petronels.Great Ordnance, Powder, Shot, Match, Bils and Bowes, Shafts, swords, pikes, l?ces, shouels, mattocks, crows, Bright armor, muskets, ready still, I say, To arme one hundred thousand in a day. And last, it is a prison vnto those That doe their Soueraigne or his lawes oppose. The Gatehouse.The Gatehouse for a prison was ordain'd, When in this land the third king Edward reign'd: Good lodging roomes, and diet it affoords, But I had rather lye at home on boords. Since Richards reigne the first, The Fleet. the Fleet hath beene A Prison, as vpon records is seene: For lodgings and for bowling, there's large space, But yet I haue no stomacke to the place. Newgate.Old Newgate I perceiue a theevish den, But yet ther's lodging for good honest men. When second Henry here the Scepter swaid, Then the foundation of that gate was laid. But sixty six yeeres ere our Sauiours birth, By Lud was Ludgate. Ludgate founded from the earth; No Iayle for theeues, though some perhaps as bad, That breake in policie, may there be had. The Poultrey Counter. Counter in the Powltry is so old, That it in History is not enrold. And Woodstreet. Woodstreet Counters age we may deriue, Since Anno fifteene hundred fifty fiue. For me the one's too old, and one's too new, And as they bake, a Gods name let them brew. Bridewell. Bridewell vnto my memory comes next; Where idlenesse and lechery is vext: This is a royall house, of state and port, Which the eighth King Henry built, and there kept Court. King Edward somewhat ere his timelesse fall, Gaue it away to be an Hospitall: Which vse the City puts it well vnto, And many pious deeds they there doe doo: But yet for Vagabonds and Runnagates, For Whores, and idle knaues, and such like mates, 'Tis little better then a Iayle to those, Where they chop chalke, for meat and drinke and blowes. In this house those that 'gainst their wils doe dwell, Loue well a Bride (perhaps) but not Bridewell. White Lyon, Kings Bench, Marshalsea, Counter and Clinke.Fiue Iayles or Prisons are in Southwarke plac'd, The Counter (once S. Margrets Church defac'd) The Marshalsea, the Kings Bench, and White Lyon, Where some like Tantalus, or like Ixion. The pinching paine of hunger daily feele, Turn'd vp and downe with fickle fortunes wheele: And some doe willingly make there abode, Because they cannot liue so well abroad. Then ther's the Clinke, where handsome lodgings be, And much good may it doe them all, for me. Crosse but the Thames vnto S. Katherins then, There is another The hole at S. Katherines. hole or den for men. Another in East Smithfield prison. East-Smithfield little better, Will serue to hold a theefe or paltry debter. New prison.Then neere three Cranes a Iayle for Hereticks, For Brownists, Familists, and Schismaticks. The Lord Wentworths.Lord Wentworths Iayle within White Chappell stands, Finsbury.And Finsbury, God blesse me from their hands. These eighteene Iayles so neere the Citty bounded, Are founded and maintain'd by men confounded: As one mans meat may be anothers bane, The Keepers full, springs from the Prisners wane: This hath beene still the vse, and euer will, That one mans welfare comes from others ill. But (as I said) mans selfe is cause of all The miseries that to him can befall. Note but our corps, how euery member lyes, Their seuerall offices, and faculties: And our owne iudgement will informe vs than, The likenesse 'twixt a prison and a man: For as man hath his limbs and linaments, His sinewes, muscles, nerues, and ligaments: His Panicles, his Arteries, his Veines, His ioynts, his membranes, and his beating braines: So hath a Iayle, Were it not for these, a Iaile would haue neither life nor soule. Writs, Warrants, &amp; Attachments, Arestings, Actions, Hues, Cries, &amp; Appeachments: With Garnish, Sharing fees, and Habeas Corpus, (Which feede some Iaylors fatter than a Porpus) And last, for euerlasting Executions, Vntill the prisoners bodies dissolutions; And if a man be hurt in legge or arme, Or head, or heele, 'tis said the man hath harme: If inward griefe doe pinch in any part, The anguish is a terror to the heart; And should a Iayle want these things nam'd before, It quickly would be miserable poore: Like men dismembred or of sense bereft, With scarcely any life or being left. For in mans corps (like prisners) alwayes lies His vertues, and his foule iniquities. And which of these his fancie liketh best, Shall still be kept in bondage, or releast. As Wisdome, Bounty, and Humilitie, (Despised in these dayes of vanitie) Some keepe so close, not suffering them to walke, So much as in bare thoughts, or deeds, or talke, Whilst Folly, and close-fisted Niggardize, With Barbarisme, haue ease and liberties. Faith, Hope and Charitie, are pent vp close, And doubts, despaire and cruelty let loose. Lust reuels it, rich clad in Robes of Pride: Friendship and Loue, are liberty denide, Whereby the liberall Arts in number seuen, Are of their liberall liberties bereauen, The whilst the seuen delightfull deadly sinnes, The game and glory of the whole world wins. The Cardnall vertues, as vnworthy prices, Are made but vassals to all Carnall vices. The Muses are mew'd vp, with woes and wants, Whilst fortune followes knaues and Ignorants: And thus within mans little Common-weale, He like a partiall Iaylor oft doth deale: Permits his goodnesse neuer to appeare, And lets his badnesse ramble any where, So Rorers, Rascals, Banquerouts politicke, With money, or with friends will finde a tricke Their Iaylor to corrupt, and at their will They walke abroad, and take their pleasure still: Whilst naked vertue, beggerly, despis'd, Beleguerd round, with miseries surpris'd, Of hope of any liberty defeated, For passing of his word is meerely cheated: And dungeond vp, may tell the wals his mones, And make relation to the senselesse stones, Where sighs and grones, &amp; teares may be his feast. Whil'st man to man, is worse than beast to beast. Till death he there must take his sad abode, Whil'st craft and coozenage walke at will abroad. Thus these comparisons doe well agree, Man to a Iayle may fitly likened bee: The thought whereof may make him wish with speed To haue his prisoned soule releast and freed. Thus Iayles and meditations of a Iayle, May serue a Christian for his great auaile. But now my Muse, thus long in bondage pent, Begins to thinke of her infranchizement: And hauing of a Prison spoke her part, She mounts vnto the Hangman and his Art. THE NECESSITIE OF Hanging. Of Hangings there's diuersity of fashions, Almost as many as are sundry Nations: For in the world all things so hanged are, That any thing vnhang'd is strange and rare. Earth hangs in the concauity of Water, And Water hangs within the Ayerie matter, The Ayre hangs in the Fierie continent: Thus Element doth hang in Element, (Without foundation) all the Massie Globe Hangs, which the skies encompasse like a Robe, For as an Simile. egge, the yolke within the white, The white within the skin's enuellop'd quite, The skin within the shell doth outmost lye: Eu'n so these Elements hang midst the skie. First, all the world where mortals liue, we see Within the Orbe of Luna hanged be; Aboue her, Mercurie his course doth steere, And next aboue him is bright Venus Sphere. And in the fourth, and middle firmament, Sol keepes his hot and fiery Regiment. Next aboue that runs Mars, that star of warre: Beyond him Iupiter, that Iouiall starre; Then last is sullen Saturnes ample bounds, Who once in thirty yeeres the world surrounds; This earthly Globe (for which men fight &amp; brawle) Compar'd to Heauen, is like an All the world is in comparison for greatnesse to the Heauens, as a hand-worme or a Nit may be compared to the world. Artom small, Or as a Needles point compar'd to it, So it to Heauen may be compared fit; And it doth Hang, and hath its residence I'th centre of the skies circumference. Thus to proue Hanging naturall, I proue, Wee liue in a hanging world.We in a Hanging world doe liue and moue. Man is a little world, wherein we see. The great worlds abstract or epitomie. And if we note each linament and lim, There are not many parts vnhang'd of him; His haire which to his head and beard belongs, Hangs, if not turn'd vp with the Barbers tongs, His armes, his hands, his legges and feet we know, Doe all hang pendant downewards as they grow: Ther's nothing of him that doth hanging skip, Except his eares, his nether teeth and lip, And when he's crost or sullen any way, He mumps, and lowres, and hangs the lip, they say: That I a wise mans sayings must approue, Man is a tree, whose root doth grow aboue, Within his braines, whose sprigs &amp; branches round, From head to foot grow downward to the ground. Thus world to world, and man to man doth call, And tels him, Hanging is most naturall: The word Dependant doth informe our reason, That Hanging will be neuer out of season. All that depends doth hang, which doth expresse, That Rich men are poore mens Gallowses. Great men are like Iybbets for the lesse. It is an old phrase, many yeeres past gone, That such a Lord hath many hangers on; Thereby describing, that all mens Attendants As it were hangers on, were call'd All dependants are hangers on. Dependants: And sure of all men, they are best indeed, Who haue most hangers on to cloath and feed; For he that hath the meanes, and not the grace, To helpe the needie, is a Miser base. Hee's no good Steward, but a hatefull Thiefe, That keepes from good Dependants their reliefe: And of all Theeues, he hanging doth deserue, Who That's a Roague. hath the power to feed, and lets men sterue. To end this point, this consequence I'll grant, He that hath wealth, no hangers on can want; For since the time that mankinde first began, It is a destinie ordain'd to man, The meane vpon the mighty should depend, And all vpon the Mightiest should attend. Thus through all ages, Countries and Dominions, We each on other hang like ropes of Onions. Some wealthy slaues, whose consciences condem, Will hang themselues, lest others hang on them; And some spend all on Hangers on so fast, That they are forc'd to steale, and hang at last. If they from these Extremes themselues could wean, There is betwixt them both a Golden meane, Which would direct their superfluities, They would not hang themselues for niggardize, Nor wastefully or prodigally spend, Till want bring them to hanging in the end, And they and many others, by their purse, Might scape that hanging which is cald a curse. There's many a That's an Asse. Gallant made of foole and feather, Of Gold and Veluet, Silke, and Spanish leather, Whose ragged Hangers on haue mou'd my minde, To see pride goe before, and shame behinde, With scarce a button, or an elboe whole, A breech, or any shooe that's worth a sole: Those that like golden lybbets, and their traines Are like poore tatter'd Theeues hang'd vp in chains. He that doth suffer Whores, or Theeues, or Knaues, Base flattering Villaines, or such kinde of slaues, To hang vpon him, and knowes what they are, That man vnto a Gallowse I compare. That Vintner I account no friend of mine, Who for good money drawes me scuruie wine, And by the rule of Conscience (not of Law) That he is fitter made to hang, then draw. The Lawyer that at length doth spin mens causes, With false delayes, and dilatory clauses, Who makes a trade to broach and draw contention, For him a hanging were a good preuention. But holla, Muse, come backe, you beare my Rime, To hanging in good earnest ere the time. There are a many sorts of hangings yet Behinde, which I by no meanes must forget: One hanging is a necessary thing, Which is a pretty gamball, cald a A Swing or stretch for exercise and health. Swing, And men of good repute I oft haue seene To hang, and stretch, and totter, for the spleene: This hanging is a military course, Not by the Law, but strength of armes, and force: Thus euery morning for a little spurt, A man may hang himselfe, and doe no hurt. This hanging oft (like Tyburne hath a tricke, Saues charge of physicke, or of being sicke. Besides, the word Hang is so much in vse, That few or none will take't as an abuse; It doth a great mans kindnesse much approue, When he shall bid a man Be hang'd in loue: And with some men 'tis common courtesie, To say, Farewell, be hang'd, that's twice God bwy. The pictures of the dearest friends we haue, Although their corps are rotten in the graue, We hang them for a reuerend memory To vs, and vnto our posterity. Some hang their wiues in picture, which haue cause To hang their persons, wer't not for the lawes: Some hang their heires in picture, who would faine Wish their good fathers hang'd, their lands to gaine. I oft haue seene good garments for mens wearing, Haue very thriftily beene hang'd to ayring; And I haue seen those garments (like good fellows) Hang kindly with their master at the Gallowse, And then into the Hangmans Wardrobe drop, Haue beene againe hang'd in a Broakers shop, Which after by a Cut purse bought might be; And make another iourney to the Tree; Twixt which, and twixt the Broaker, it might goe Or ride, some twelue or thirteene times, or moe. Thus th' hangmans haruest, and the Brokers grow, They reape the crop, which sin and shame doth sow. There are rich Hangings made of Tapestrie, Of Arras, and of braue embrodery; Those are for Princes, and for men of worth, T'adorne their roomes, and set their greatnes forth. But as dead bones in painted Tombes doe bide, These If all traitors, hypocrites, flatterers, extortioners, oppressours, bribetakers, cheaters, panders, bawds, &amp;c. were hang'd vp in the woods on seuerall trees, there is no Arras, or Tapestry can grace and adorne a Princes Court, as those Hangings could become a Common-wealth. Hangings, filthy rotten wals doe hide. A Harts-horne to a post fast nailed on, Serues well for men to hang their hats vpon: But if they knew their heads would serue the turne, They would not shift their hats from horne to horn. Mens swords in Hangers Hang, fast by their side, Their Stirrops Hang, when as they vse to ride: Our Conies and our Deere are Hang'd in toiles, Our meat hangs o'r the fire when as it boiles; Our light Hangs in the Lanthorne, all men sees Our fruit wee eat was hang'd vpon the trees, Signes hang on posts, shew whereas tradsmen dwels, In steeples all men know are Hang'd the Bels, The scales or ballance hangs where things are weigh'd Goods Hang'd in Craines, that's in or out conuei'd; Yards, sailes, sheets, tacks, lists, caskets, bolins, braces, Are fitly hang'd in their conuenient places. The compasse that directs where windes doe blow, Is Hang'd vpon the Needles point we know: In stately buildings, Timber, Lead and Stone, Are Hang'd and hoist, or Buildings would be none. Here is an army of Hangings.Our Maps wherein the world described be, Are all Hang'd vp against the wals we see: Our Cazements Hang as they doe ope and shut, Our Curtaines Hang, which 'bout our beds we put; Our Hogs are Hang'd, else Bacon we might looke. Doores Hang on hinges, or I am mistooke; And many a trusty Padlocke Hangs no doubt, To let in honest men, and keepe knaues out. Sea-Cabins Hang, where poore men sleepe and rest, Our Clokes Hang on our backs 'tis manifest: The Viall, Citterne, the Bandore and Lute, Are cas'd or vncas'd, all Hang'd vp and mute: Our Linnen (being wash'd) must Hang to dry, Or else Lice will Hang on and multiply: Thus Hanging's beneficiall to all States, Whilst Gods dread curse Hangs o'r the reprobates. And as for those that take my lines amis, And will be pleas'd to be displeas'd with this, For groats a piece, nay lesse, for three pence either, I'll giue them all leaue to be Hang'd together; Since Hanging then is prou'd so naturall, So beneficiall, so generall, So apt, so necessary, and so fit, Our reason tels vs we should honour it. It is a good mans life, and 'tis their death, That rob and rifle men of goods and breath: This kind of Hanging all offences ends, From which God euer blesse me and my friends. I from the Hangman this conclusion draw, He is the fatall period of the Law: If thieues or traytors into mischiefe runne, If he haue done with them, then they haue done. 'Tis often seene that many haplesse men Haue beene condemn'd and iudg'd, reprieu'd agen, And pardon'd, haue committed new transgressions, And in againe oft many a Size and Sessions: When many warnings mend them not therefore, The Hangman warnes them, they offend no more. Hee's the Catastrophe and Epilogue Of many of the desperate Catalogue; And he is one that cannot wanted be, But still God keepe him farre enough from me. THE DESCRIPTION OF TYBVRNE. I haue heard sundry men oft times dispute Of trees, that in one yeere will twice beare fruit. But if a man note Tyburne, 'will appeare, That that's a tree that beares twelue times a yeere. I muse it should so fruitfull be, for why I vnderstand the root of it is dry, It beares no leafe, no blossome, or no bud, The raine that makes it fructifie is bloud. I further note, the fruit which it produces, Doth seldome serue for profitable vses: Except the skilfull Surgions industry Doe make Desection Anatomy. It blossomes, buds, and beares, all three together, And in one houre, doth liue, and die, and wither. Like Sodom Apples, they are in conceit, For touch'd, they turne to dust and ashes streight. Besides I find this tree hath neuer bin Like other fruit trees, wall'd or hedged in, But in the high-way standing many a yeere, It neuer yet was rob'd, as I could heare. The reason is apparent to our eyes, That what it beares, are dead commodities: And yet sometimes (such grace to it is giuen) The dying fruit is well prepar'd for heauen, And many times a man may gather thence Remorse, deuotion, and true penitence. And from that tree, I thinke more soules ascend To that Cœlestiall ioy, which ne'r shall end: I say, more soules from thence to heau'n doe come, Than from all Except Pauls Churchyard and Saint Gregories, where many inhabitants are dwelling, as Drapers, Stationers, empty Trunk and Tragicall blacke Bottle-makers, who now and then doe dye there; whom I doe verily beleeue haue soules. Also I except the Close at Salisbury, with all Cathedrall Churchyards, and others, where any body dwels, if it be but a Sumner, or a Sexton. Church-yards throughout Christendome. The reason is, the bodies all are dead, And all the soules to ioy or woe are fled. Perhaps a weeke, a day, or two, or three, Before they in the Church-yards buried bee. But at this Tree, in twinkling of an eye, The soule and body part immediatly, There death the fatall parting blow doth strike, And in Church-yards is seldome seene the like. Besides, they are assisted with the almes Of peoples charitable prayers, and Psalmes, Which are the wings that lift the hou'ring spirit, By faith, through grace, true glory to inherit. Concerning this dead fruit, I noted it, In stead of paste it's put into a pit, And laid vp carefully in any place, Yet worme-eaten it growes in little space. My vnderstanding can by no meanes frame, To giue this Tyburne fruit a fitter name, Than Medlers, for I find that great and small, (To my capacity) are Medlers all. Some say they are Choak'd peares, and some againe Doe call them Hartie Choakes, but 'tis most plaine, It is a kinde of Medler it doth beare, Or else I thinke it neuer would come there. Moreouer where it growes, I find it true, It often turnes the Herke of grace to Rue. Amongst all Pot-herbes growing on the ground, Time is the least respected, I haue found, And most abus'd, and therefore one shall see No branch or bud of it grow neere this Tree: For 'tis occasion of mans greatest crime, To turne the vse, into abuse, of Time. When passions are let loose without a bridle, Then precious Time is turnd to Loue and Idle: And that's the chiefest reason I can show, Why fruit so often doth on Tyburne grow. There are inferiour Gallowses which beare (According to the season) twice a yeare: And there's a kinde of watrish Tree at Wapping, Wheras Sea-theeues or Pirats are catch'd napping: But Tyburne doth deserue before them all The title and addition capitall, Of Arch or great Grand Gallowse of our Land, Whilst all the rest like ragged Laqueyes stand; It hath (like Luna) full, and change, and quarters, It (like a Merchant) monthly trucks and barters; But all the other Gallowses are fit, Like Chapmen, or poore Pedlers vnto it. Thus Iayles and Iaylors being here explain'd, How both are good, and for good vse ordain'd: All sorts of Hanging which I could surmise, I likewise haue describ'd before your eyes; And further hauing shew'd what Tyburne is, With many more inferiour Gallowsis, My pen from paper with this Prayer doth part, God blesse all people from their sinnes desart. FINIS. The Vnnaturall Father: OR, The cruell Murther committed by one Iohn Rovvse of the Towne of Ewell, ten miles from London, in the County of Surry, vpon two of his owne Children. John Rovvse of Ewell his owne Arraignment, Confession, Condemnation, and Iudgement of himselfe, whilst hee lay Prisoner in the White Lyon, for drowning of his two Children. I am arraign'd at the blacke dreadfull Barre, Where Sinnes (sored as Scarlet) Iudges are; All my Inditements are my horrid Crimes, Whose Story will affright succeeding Times, As (now) they driue the present into wonder, Making Men tr?ble, as trees strucke with Thunder. If any askes what euidence comes in? O 'Tis my Conscience, which hath euer bin A thousand witnesses: and now it tels A Tale, to cast me to ten thousand Hels. The Iury are my Thoughts (vpright in this,) They sentence me to death for doing amisse: Examinations more there need not then, Than what's confest here both to God and Men. The Cryer of the Court is my blacke Shame, Which when it calls my Iury, doth proclaime, Vnlesse (as they are summon'd) they appeare, To giue true Verdict of the Prisoner, They shall haue heauy Fines vpon them set, Such, as may make them dye deepe in Heauens debt: About me round sit Innocence and Truth, As Clerkes to this high Court; and little Ruth From Peoples eyes is cast vpon my face: Because my facts are barbarous, damn'd, and base. The Officers that 'bout me (thicke) are plac'd, To guard me to my death, (when I am cast) Are the blacke stings my speckled soule now feeles, Which like to Furies dogge me, close at heeles. The Hangman that attends me, is Despaire, And gnawing wormes my fellow-Prisoners are. His Inditement for murder of his Children. The first who (at this Sessions) lowd doth call me Is Murder, whose grim visage doth appall me; His eyes are fires, his voice rough winds out-rores, And on my head the Diuine vengeance scores: So fast and fearefully I sinke to ground, And wish I were in twenty Oceans drownd. He sayes, I haue a bloudy Villaine bin, And (to proue this) ripe Euidence steps in, Brow'd like my selfe: Iustice so brings about, That blacke sinnes still hunt one another out: 'Tis like a rotten frame ready to fall; For one maine Post being shaken, puls downe all. To this Inditement, (holding vp my hand,) Fettered with Terrors more then Irons stand, And being ask'd what to the Bill I say, Guilty, I cry. O dreadfull Sessions day! His Iudgement. For these thick Stigian streams in which th'ast swom, Thy guilt hath on thee laid this bitter doome; Thy loath'd life on a Tree of shame must take A leaue compeld by Law, e'r old age make Her signed Passe port ready. Thy offence No longer can for dayes on earth dispense. Time blot thy name out of this bloudy roule, And so the Lord haue mercy on my Soule. His speech what hee could say for himselfe. O wretched Caitiffe! what perswasiue breath, Can cal back this iust Sentence of quick death? I begge no boone, but mercy at Gods hands, (The King of Kings, the Soueraigne that c?mands Both Soule and Body) O let him forgiue My Treason to his Throne, and whilst I liue, Iebbits and Racks shall torture limme by limme, Through worlds of Deaths I'l breake to fly to him. My Birth-day gaue not to my Mothers wombe, More ease, then this shall ioyes, when e'r it come. My body mould to earth, sinnes sink to Hell, My penitent Soule win Heauen, vain world farewell. FINIS. [TAYLORS REVENGE.] TAYLORS REVENGE: OR, The Rimer William Fennor, firkt, ferrited, and finely fetcht ouer the Coales. William Fennor. Anagramma. NV Villany For me; OR, Forme NV Villany. Nv Villany For me, Nue, fresh and New, Or Forme NV Villany, Come Turk, come Iew, Come who dares come, for I haue found a Theame, That ouerflowes with matter like a streame. And now stand cleere, my masters, 'ware your shine, For now to kick and fling my Muse begins, How fit his name is Anagrammatiz'd, And how his Nature is Anatomiz'd, 'Twould make a horse with laughing breake his bridle, But to the purpose, long delayes are idle. To William Fennor. Come Sirrha; Rascall, off your clothes S?, strip, For my Satyrrick whip shall make you skip: Th'adst better to haue dealt with all the Deuils, They could not plague thee with so many euils. Nay come man, neuer whine, or crooch, or kneele, My heart cannot one iot of pitty feele, I'haue squeez'd the Gall from out the Lernean snake, With which, Reuengefull Inke I meane to make, Which I with Aqua-fortis will commix, Yblended with the lothsome Lake of Stix, And with that Marrow-eating hatefull Inke I'll make thee (more then any Aiax) stinke, A Scritch-owles quill shall be my fatall pen, That shall emblaze thee basest slaue of men. So that when as the pur-blind world shall see How vildly thou hast plaid the Rogue with mee, They shall perceiue I wrong them not for pelfe, And thou shalt (like a Rascall) hang thy selfe. What damned Villaine would forsweare &amp; sweare As thou didst, 'gainst my challenge to appeare, To answer me at Hope, vpon the stage, And thereupon, my word I did ingage, And to the world did publish printed Bills, With promise that we both would shew our skills. And then your Rogue-ship durst not shew your face, But ran away, and left me in disgrace. To thee, ten shillings I for earnest gaue To bind thee, that thou shouldst not play the Knaue. Curre, hadst thou no mans Credit to betray But mine, or couldst thou find no other way, To Sharke, or Shift, or Cony-catch for mony, But to make me thy Asse, thy Foole, thy Cony? Could not thy Squire and thee, (a brace of Varlots) Rim'd, Fool'd, &amp; Pip'd, 'mongst pocky Whores &amp; Harlots, For two-pence in some drunken Bawdy-booth To please thy Doxy-dells sweet stinking tooth, Wheras thou mightst (as thou hast often done) Some scraps and broken beere, for wages wone, Which to maintaine thy state had been some meanes Amongst thy fellowes, Rascalls, Rogues, &amp; Queanes. Thou scuruy squint-eyd brazen-fac'd Baboon, Thou dam'd Stigmaticall foule Pantaloone, Thou Tauerne, Alehouse, Whorehouse, Gig of time, That for a groat wilt amongst Tinkers rime. I'll hale from Hell grim visag'd Nemesis, Whom I will Scull o'r siluer Thamesis, Which to and fro, shall still torment and towze thee. And none but Runnagates (like thee) shall howze thee. Thine owne tongue (trumpet like) each where proclaimes Thy selfe a seruant to my Soueraigne Iames, When as thy seruice to the King is such As Athiests vnto God, and scarce to much. It may bee (graclesse) thou hast graced bin, And in the Presence didst admittance win, Where some stolne rimes, and some things of thine owne, To please the eares of Greatnesse thou hast showne. Which (at the first hath wonne thee some applawse, Although perhaps not worth three barly strawes. And you forsooth, must presently giue out Amongst your kitchingstuffe whor-hedge bird rout, What Noble-man your scuruinesse did bring Into the Court, and how our Gracious King, (As on a man most worthy to bestow it) Intitled you his Highnesse Riming-Poet. How dares thy ouerweening saucy tongue, Presume to doe a Poets name that wrong? How darst thou (being altogether vile) Attribute to thy selfe that Sacred stile? Shall that rare Art (which gods and men admire, Polluted be by such a scuruie Squire? Shall Heau'n-bred Poesie that so long hath lasted, With thy contagious breath be Bussard-blasted? Then Homer from thy Toomb, with speed returne, And Marro rouze thee from thy peacefull Vrne. Braue Naso to the world againe retire, And repossesse that rare Promothean fire, Which erst inspir'd you, heere you may behold, The face of Impudency ouer-bold, That dares put on that sweet Poetique name, Which hath eterniz'd your Immortall fame. Reuenge you Muses, vp, awake, awake, Or euer sinke to the Lethean Lake. And you braue Moderne Poets, whose sweet lines, All Heau'nly, earthly, Harmony combines, Can you, O can your senses be stupidious, And see your selues abused thus perfidious! Oh if the case were mine, as it is yours, I would raine vengeance in reuengefull showres, Which furious storme for euer should disperse, And dash to pieces these base Groomes in verse. An Asse in cloth of gold, is but an Asse, And Riming-Rascalls may for Poets passe, Amongst mis-iudging, and illiterate mynds, But iudgement knowes to vse them in their kinds. My selfe knowes how (sometimes) a verse to frame, Yet dare I not put on a Poets name, And I dare write with thee at any time For what thou darst, in either Prose or Rime, For thou of Poesie art the very scum Of Riff-raff-Rubish wit, the totall summe, The lothsome Glaunders of all base abuse, The onely Filch-line of each labring Muse, The Knaue, the Asse, the Coxcomb and the Foole, The scorne of Poets, and true wits Close-stoole. But all your Tauerne and your Alehouse prate. Is how your entertainment was in State, With this great Lord, and that embrodered Knight, With that faire Countesse, and that Lady bright, Though where thou come thou shift, &amp; lye, &amp; lurch, As welcome as a Dog into a Church. Dost thinke the King and's Courtiers doth not see, And know that nothing good can come from thee? Can Swine yeeld sweet perfumes, can Swans breed Crowes? Can flatt'ring Rogues haue but dissembling showes? Can health be hidden in the plague or pox? Can men take pride in fetters, bonds or stocks? And more vnpossible then are all these, It is that thou shouldst any wise man please, Except it be a flash, a sparke, a spurt, Soon in, soone out, and then as sweet as durt, Or like a candle's snuffe, for pleasing scent, Thou lean'st them deeply pleasd with discontent, For thou (like stinking Fish) art growne so stale, A whole daies Rime not worth a pot of Ale. But shortly I doe hope to see braue sport, To haue thee soundly whip'd from out the Court: For well I know my King will not allow His house to harbour such a Rogue as thou. I vow to God, my Ink-horne I'll not shut, Or sleepe shall not mine eyes together put, Before each night I write some scourging verse, That in reuenge thy Iadish heart shall pierce. For I, whose credit ne'r before was tainted, Nor euer was with cheating tricks acquainted, To be by thee thus basely vsde and crost, And in the world my reputation lost, And all by thee, that merit'st nought but banging, For sure I thinke, thou'lt ne'r be worth the hanging. Yet rather then thou shouldst a hanging want, I'de trusse thee vp for naught, were Hangmen scant, Nay I would doe it freely, and for nothing, And giue thy Wife againe my fee and cloathing: Which courtesie of mine, no doubt, would moue The creatures kindnesse to requite my loue. On her thou laid'st the fault: thou said'st that shee Did force thee basely runne away from mee. Thou Dolt, thou Dunce, more blockish then a Mule, None but a Wittall giues his wife the rule. No, 'twas thy Coward heart, ful fraught with feare, 'Twas nothing else that made thee not appeare. Hadst thou the conquest got, I had not car'd, So thou vnto thy word hadst had regard, Then sure the Players had not playd a play, But thou or I had borne away the day. And now to giue the world a little tast Of the strange brunts and puzzles that I past, I will not write a word shall be vntrue, That men may know, thou vsde me like a Iew, And that I doe not raile on thee so sore, But that my wrongs doe vrge me to doe more. The house was fil'd with Newters, Foes, &amp; Friends, And euery one their money frankly spends. But when I saw the day away did fade, And thy look'd-for appearance was not made, I then stept out, their angers to appease, But they all raging, like tempestuous Seas: Cry'd out, their expectations were defeated, And how they all were cony-catch'd and cheated: Some laught, some swore, some star'd &amp; stamp'd and curst, And in confused humors all out burst. I (as I could) did stand the desp'rate shock, And bid the brunt of many dang'rous knock. For now the stinkards, in their irefull wraths Bepelted me with Lome, with Stones, and Laths, One madly sits like bottle Ale, and hisses, Another throwes a stone, and 'cause he misses, He yawnes and bawles, and cryes Away, away: Another cryes out, Iohn, begin the Play. I thinke this Babel of confused action Would sure haue made thee stink with feares distraction, One sweares and stormes, another laughs &amp; smiles, Another madly would pluck off the tiles. Some runne to'th doore to get againe their coyne, And some doe shift, and some againe purloine. One valiantly stept out vpon the Stage, And would teare downe the hangings in his rage. (God grant hee may haue hanging at his end, That with me for the hangings did contend.) Such clapping, hissing, swearing, stamping, smiling, Applauding, scorning, liking, and reuiling, Did more torment mee then a Purgatorie: Yet I (in scorne of windie pomp stage glory) Did stand it out, vnconquer'd, vnsubdude, Despight the Hydra-headed multitude. Now goodman Dog, a halter catch your muzzell, Your not appearance brought me in this puzzell, But I (to giue the Audience some content) Began to act what I before had ment: And first I plaid a maundering Roguish creature, (A part thou couldst haue acted well by nature) Which act did passe, and please, and fild their iawes With wrinkled laughter, and with good applause. Then came the players, and they play'd an act, Which greatly from my action did detract. For 'tis not possible for any one To play against a company alone, And such a company (I'll boldly say) That better (nor the like) e'r play'd a Play. In briefe, the Play my action did eclips, And in a manner seal'd vp both my lips. Suppose it were a black Cimmerian night, And that some 12 or 16 Torches light Should make night seeme an artificiall day, And then suppose, these Torches past away, Whilst dismall darknesse straight resumes the place, Then after all comes in with glimm'ring pace A silly Taper. How would that alone Shew when the flaming Torches all were gone? Eu'n so seem'd I, amidst the guarded troope Of gold-lac'd Actors, yet all could not droope My fixed mind, for where true courage roots, The Prouerb sayes, Once ouer shooes, o'r boots. 'Twere easier to subdue wilde Beares or Bores, Or row to High-gate with a paire of Oares, Or to make thee an vpright honest man, (Which sore God will not, nor the Diuell can) 'Twere lesser labour to blow downe Pauls-steeple, Then to appease, or please the raging people. The Play made me as sweet in their opinions, As Tripes well fry'd in Tarr, or Egges with Onions. I, like a Beare vnto the stake was tide, And what they said, or did, I must abide. A pox vpon him for a Rogue, sayes one, And with that word he throwes at me a stone, A second my estate doth seeme to pitty, And saies my action's good, my speeches witty. A third doth screw his chaps awry, and mew, His selfe conceited wisdome so to shew. Thus doth the Third, the Fourth, the Fift and Six Most Galliemaufrey-like their humors mix. Such Motley, Medley, Linsey-Woolsey speeches Would sure haue made thee vilifie thy breeches. What I endur'd vpon that earthly hell, My tongue or pen cannot describe it well. And rather then Ile doe the like once more, I would be married to an arrant Whore. And that's a plague I could wish well to thee: For it would worser then a hanging bee. And let me say my best in my excuse, The Audience all were wrong'd with great abuse, Great cause they had to take it in offence, To come from their affaires with such expence By Land and Water, and then at the play So extraordinarily to pay, And when the thing should bee that they expected, Then nothing to their likings was effected. Their mirth to madnes, liking turn'd to lothing, For when all came to all, all came to nothing. Thus hast thou had a little slender taste Of my designes, and how I was disgrac'd, For which I am beholding to you, Sir, For had you come, there had beene no such stir, Not cause the people long'd thy selfe to see, But that they look'd thou shouldst disgraced bee. To see vs two the people did repaire, And not to see or heare or play or Player. Why what a faithlesse Rascall art thou then? Dar'st thou to looke vpon me once agen? Which if thou dost, were't not for feare of Lawes, I'de stab my Dagger thorow both thy iawes. But much I scorne my fingers should be foule With beating such a durty dunghill-Owle. But I'll rib-roast thee, and bum-bast thee still With my enraged Muse, and angry Quill. And so I leaue thy carkas and apparell Vnto the Hangman, who shall end our quarrell. My full opinion of thee sure is this, In no Church-booke thy name recorded is, But that thou wast begotten in some ditch, Betwixt a Tinker and a Maundring Witch, And sure thy birth did equall thy begetting, I thinke thy Mother in the Sun-shine sitting, Basking her selfe close to some hedge of Thorne, And so without a Midwife thou wast borne. And there the Sunne with his illustrous light Screwd quite awry the Windowes of thy sight. Then afterwards the Matrone thought it meet To wrap thee vp within some hedge-stolne sheet, And making thee her sweet vnchristian packe, Some six or seu'n yeere bare thee on her backe, Instructing thee in the braue Canting tong, And how in Pedlers French to sing a song, And Rime for Butter-milke, for Curds and Whay, And in a Barne at night thy bones to lay. This I doe thinke of thee, I'll not say so, Thou know'st it best if it be so or no. This (by thine owne report) some few yeeres since Thou Rim'st at Grauesend for some fourteene pence I the street, from seuenteene people vnrespected, This Graund Collection, iustly was collected. As I doe hope for blisse, I hate thee not For any goods or credit thou hast got In Court or Citty. But thy praise I'll sing, If any way thou didst delight the King. So many tedious cares are daily throwne Vpon the Royall-head that weares a Crowne, That into action I would melt my spright, Thereby to giue my Sou'raigne some delight. For such things I doe loue and wish thee well, But that I thinke no such in thee doe dwell. Therefore I hate thee, as thou dost behaue Thy selfe like to a cooz'ning paltry Knaue. What heere I write, vpon thee I'll make good, And in the hazzard I'll engage my bloud. But as I said before, againe I'll say, I scorne on such a Rascall, hands to lay, For the old prouerb is Authenticall, (Who touches pitch shall be defilde withall.) Thou hast a pate can forge a Mint of lies, Else how is't possible thou couldst deuise At once to flap me and the world i'th mouth, That thou wast rid, East, West, and North, &amp; South? That day thou shouldst haue met me on the Stage Thou wentst three waies at once on pilgrimage, Thou sent'st me word tho' wast sent for to the Court, Thy wife said, thou with speed must make resort To fetch her portion out of Warwick-shire, And the day after 'twas my chance to heare, How thou for begging of a Fellons pardon, Wast rid downe into Kent to fetch thy guerdon. So that the portion that thou wentst to fet, Thou from the Gallowes (thy best friend) didst get. But though thou rob the Gallowes of his fee, It will (at last) for principall catch thee. Where (for thou guld'st me at the Hope) I hope Thou wilt conclude thy rogu'ry in a Rope, Three Trees, two Rampant, and the other Crossant, One halter Pendant, and a ladder Passant, In a field Azure, (clouded like the Skye) Because 'twixt Earth and Ayre I hope thou'lt dye. These Armes for thee, my muse hath Heraldiz'd, And to exalt thee, them shee hath deuisde. Then when thou bidst the world thy last good-night Squint vpward, and cry, Gallowes, claime thy right. To whose protection, thy estate I tender, And all thy Rights and Titles I surrender, Thy Carkas and thy Manners (that are euill) To Tyburne, Hangman, and (thy sire) the Deuill. Thine as thou hast deseru'd, Iohn Taylor. To the Reader. Now honest Reader (if thou be so) tell, Haue I not Canuas'd this same Rascall well? Me thinkes I heare some say I am too bitter, And if I were more milde, they hold it fitter. Let such men truely but conceiue my wrong, And thinke the case did to themselues belong: When such a fellow with me shall agree, And take my money for an earnest fee: And make me print a thousand Bils and more, And daily on the Posts to clap vp store, For thousand Readers as they passe the way, To see my name engag'd to play a Play 'Gainst William Fennor, my Antagonist; And then, for me each houre to persist, (Vpon his word) to study and to write, And scarce in six weekes rest or day, or night; And when the time is come the play should be, My opposite should run away from me, And leaue me to be made a wondring stocke, A scorne, a by-word, for the world to mocke: To make me lose my credit, and my name, To be o'rclouded with perpetuall shame. Iudge, if this would not moue a man to spleene, To be thus basely vs'd as I haue beene. Thus to the censure of the World I send This sharpe Inuectiue, which my Anger pend. And as my wrong was publike, so will I Reuenged be vpon him publikely. And for him I haue worser Rods in pisse, If he but dare to write and answer this. But if he durst no better play the Knaue Then answer me, he would not goe so braue. But yet heer's one thing was almost forgot, Which till this time my Muse remembred not, And sure it must his Fooleship needs molest, This hath beene read and laught at by the Best, That when he dares but to the Court to come, His entertainment will be like Iack Drum. To my Friends. And now, kind Friends, a word or two to you, Before I bid your Iudgements all adiew. Full well I know you all were angred much, That my vnfortunate euents were such: And well I know, you do beleeue and know, I meant no shuffling-shifting tricke to show. To you my minde doth need no more reuealing, You all doe know I meant plaine vpright dealing; And sure I hope your informations will Defend me 'gainst the force of scandall still. There were some Lords, some Knights, Esquires, and some Good Marchants, Tradesmen, to the Play did come, On purpose onely for my onely sake, The most of which I know will vndertake, To doe me any good in word or deed, If my occasions did require their need: Though my deserts can no such fauour win, Yet well they know I still haue honest bin: I speake not this in any tearmes of boast, For why, my faults are equall with the most: But this is written, that it may appeare, That I from cony-catching tricks am cleare: And vnto all the world I dare appeale, Who dares accuse me that I did misdeale. So crauing pardon where I haue transgrest, I wish my Friends all earthly, heau'nly rest. To my despightfull Foes. To you that screwd your Iawes awry, &amp; mewd, And so your worthlesse, witlesse wisdom shewd, And now and then bestow'd a hisse or twaine, (To giue more vent to your fantasticke braine) You might haue kept away, I sent not for you. If you hate me, I doe as much abhor you: Like Guests vnbid, you might haue brought your stools, For as you came, you went away like Fools. The purpose which my study did intend, Was by no meanes any one to offend; And therefore whatsoeuer that they be, That enuiously do raile and snarle at me, I can no lesse doe, but with word and pen, Informe them that they are malicious men. 'Gainst no man in particular I write, But generally to all that beare me spight: I pray for them (to make their fury madder) God turn their hearts, or Hangman turn the ladder, Which turning sure will either mend or end them, To one of which my daily Prayers commend them. FINIS. FENNORS DEFENCE: OR, I AM YOVR FIRST MAN. Wherein the Water-man, Iohn Taylor, is dasht, sowst, and finally fallen into the Thames: With his slanderous Taxations, base Imputations, scandalous Accusations, and foule Abominations, against his Maiesties Ryming Poet: who hath answered him without Vexations or trembling Recantations. DEDICATED To all that iudge, of what degree soeuer. [Although I cannot Rogue it, as he can] Although I cannot Rogue it, as he can, Yet will I shew my selfe an honest man. An Apologie to the Anagram of my Name, made by no Scholler, but a Sculler. It were a simple Tree thy breath could shake; But see (meere Malice) how thou dost mistake: For what thy Title would bestow on me, Thy selfe art Author of, New Villanie, But since thou vrgest me, marke how I'l blase That name, which thou with villany wouldst glase: For I will ope the Casement, and cleare Light Shall chase thy blacke verse to eternall Night. When the first William, Duke of Normandy, Sayl'd from the Coasts of France to Britany, Amongst his best Rankes came a Chiualiere, Whose name in French was called le Fogniere; Which then our English Tong so well did tender, Gaue him the Name and Title of Defender, On the Sea-coasts he did defend so well; That for his Chrest he beares the Scallop shell. Since, briefer Language giues vs Fennors dame, Nor can thy impudence impaire the same: And for a Token of wrong'd Innocence, I doe resume my first name for Defence. My Anagram if thou but rightly scan, Then thou wilt find 'tis, I will feare no man. How can I then feare thee that art a Taylor; A shred of Fustian, and a ragged raylor; A dish that is not worth the feeding on, When thou art best in Lent, th'art but Poore Iohn. An Anagram vpon the Scullers Name. Iohn Taylor, Anagramma. O Hate, rayle on. O hate, rayle on; or this. Rayle on, O Hate: For spight of Rayling, I must dedicate An answere to thy Theame, though ne'r so large, Will sink thy Scullers Boat, though 'twere a Barge, To halter vp your Muse, my Muse beginnes; I'l trusse the Iade for breaking peoples shinnes. Then Monster doe thy worst, yerke out thy fill, Thou canst not touch my goodnesse with thy ill: Though Horses breake their Bridles, and escape, My Lines shall load an Asse, or whippe an Ape. To his approued Poe Iohn Taylor. I haue lookt ouer with my best Prospectiues, And view'd the tenor of thy base Inuectiues: But if thou knewst how slenderly I weigh them, Thou wouldst not make such labor to display th?: All that my Lyntia in thy vaine discernes, Is Roguish Language, such as Newgate learnes. I thinke thou hast beene tutor'd in the Stewes, For thine's the perfect speech they onely vse: Base Roguish Wishes, Cursing and Reuiling, Tempestuous Raylings, and good names defiling. Yet maugre Mallice Iohn, I pittie thee, For all the paines thou hast bestow'd on mee; And were my purse but of abilitie, I'd recompence thy labours horriblie: But since my meanes vnable is to right thee, Marke how my Penne in kindnes shall requite thee. I will bestow a sheet or two of Paper, And sit the burning of a Tallow Taper, To tell thee thou art monstrous insolent, Although thy Verse is lame and impotent; And at the highest, thou art but partaker With Libell-spreaders, or some Ballad-maker. But doe not thinke thou dealst with Coriat, Whose bosome thou didst bolt a Story at; Nor looke not for such batterie at my walls, As 'gainst the Knight o'th Sun, or Archibals; Expect not Captaine Ottooles vnderstanding: No, no; against a Bulwarke thou art banding Of better temper, and a nobler spirit, Then euer thy base bosome could inherit. 'Gainst Cynthia, like a Wolfe, thou'lt bark &amp; howle, Whereby thou shewst thy iudgement dark &amp; foule. Thou grieu'st, my muse with her reflecting rayes Hath quite eclipst a famous Scullers praise: Thou wouldst haue Poesie in none to flourish But in thy selfe; O thou art too too currish: Banish this selfe-conceit; false shadie dreames Hang in thy heart, and driue thee to extremes. But why doe I presume to counsell thee, That hat'st good counsell, as thou hatest me? Wherefore I leaue thy brazen impudence, To answer thy Reuenge with my Defence. Defence. How Rascall-like thou dealst with me at first; Thou shewst from what antiquitie th'art nurst: How darst thou of thy Satyre-musicke boast, That now standst bound vnto the whipping post? But I will spare thee, thou intemperate Asse, Vntill in Bride-well thou shalt currant passe. Thou sayst, I had better with the Deuill deale; By which thou dost thy wickednesse reueale: But I haue nought to doe with him, or thee; If thou be his companion, God blesse me. To crouch, or whyne, thou giu'st me no occasion; But I must laugh at thy absurd perswasion; Thou art that Lernean Snake, squeeze thine owne gall, But 'tis too bad to make thee Inke withall. Th'ast gone so long to Styx for mingled Inke, That all thy verses in mens nosthrils stinke. For pens, the Scritch-Owles feathers are too tough; A Gooses wing for thee is good ynough. Thou hast emblaz'd me Basest slaue of men; That name I freely send thee backe agen, Vntill the world hath better eyes to see, Which is the basest lacke, my selfe, or thee. Thou call'st me Rogue so artificiall, That I must iudge thee for one naturall: The iniurie proceeded from thy tongue, And yet thou wouldst make me thy cloake for wrong. But do'st thou thinke the matter is no more, But hang my selfe? thy counsell I abhore: And take thou heed of this inchanted spell, Iohn Taylor ended like Achitophel. What foolish Asse, like thee, would take in hand To play a Play, that couldst not vnderstand, What thine owne folly is, thou art so blind; Onely to basenesse thou art well inclin'd. Do'st thinke I had no businesse, but to wait On thy detested Fopperies conceit? Yet I protest, hadst thou but sent the Bill, For me to answer, I'd haue shew'd my skill: Which would haue beene so much to thy disgrace, That thou againe durst ne'r haue shew'd thy face. Canst thou imagine, that I went away, For feare of thee, or thy contemned Play? Know, foole, when on the Stage I purchas'd worth, I scorn'd to send for thee to helpe me forth. And put the case that I should challenge thee, Thy rayling spirit could not answer mee: For thou art nothing without three months studie; I'd beat my braines out, if they were so muddie. Fiue shillings I confesse I had of thee; Which I protest my seruant had from mee, For to repay thee: but since he did fayle, Thou might'st haue sent to me; not write, and rayle On him, that holds his honestie more deere Then all the Thames reuenewes in a yeere. But here thou driu'st me to a short demurre, To know why thou shouldst call a Cristian, Curre: Oh, I haue found it; to my griefe I see, That Curres and Christians are alike to thee. But was thy credit by my treason slaine? Faith I know none thou hadst to lose or staine. I wonder much at thy simplicitie, That thou shouldst challenge me for sharking thee; When of my troth I had rather giue thee gifts, Then see thee driuen to such paltrie shifts. Thou and thy Squire oft haue ferried mee, More oft then I and mine haue rim'd to thee. If euer I haue sung to nastie Whores, Thou, or some Pander, like thee, kept the dores: For I am sure, that for as little meanes, As two pence, thou wilt carry knaues and queanes. I know not what thou meanst by Doxie Dell, It seemes with them thou art acquainted well. For scrappes and broken beere it is so rare For me to rime, that thou shalt haue my share: For though much wealth I want to maintaine me, I'll neuer trouble Whores, nor Rogues, nor thee. Allow I am squint-eyde, yet with those eyes, I can thy Baboones trickes anatomize. But prethee, which of all the Deuils cramb'd That word of iudgement in thee, Thou art damb'd? I'd rather wish thee talke of thy saluation, Lest hate should hurrie thee into damnation. Hadst thou begun with Brothell, then transcended Vnto a Tauerne, thou my state hadst mended: But thou dost all thou canst to cut my throat, And cheat me of the Tinker and his groat: Thou hast so many voyages to hell, That Nemesis will like thy visage well; And for to make hels number one the fuller, Charon will take thee for his vnder Sculler: And fr? those tossing torments which torment thee, I'll find a shelter, though it discontent thee. Why dost thou blame my tongue, 'cause it proclaims My selfe a seruant to my Soueraigne Iames? I would all hearts &amp; tongues with mine would sing, Their loyall duty to my Lord the King. His Royall fauour makes thy enuy swell, As by thy words all may discerne it well. Thy base comparison I hate and curse, Pray heauen thy seruice to him proue no worse: For then my Rime shall tell thee this in Reason, Shalt ne'r be hang'd for fellony nor treason. Now for the rest, thou poore Beare-garden sport, I scorne to tell thee how I liue in Court: Yet for to certifie thee, thou shalt know it, It hath pleasd the King to call me his Ryming Poet. Although too farre vnworthy, I confesse, To merit it, the Title I possesse: Yet, without boasting, let me boldly say, I'll ryme with any man that breaths this day, Vpon a subiect in extempore, Or else be blotted from all memorie, For any wager dare ingaged be. Then thinke what cause I had to run from thee? Except it were, because I would not heare, How thou absurdly didst abuse each eare. But thou dost taske me with my sawcinesse, That I my selfe a Poet dare professe: Wouldst thou haue me rob Nature of her gifts; Why, that were baser then thy basest shifts: Yet my esteeme of course extempory, Is but as seruile to sweet Poesie. Why wouldst thou trouble Homer from his rest, To view the slanders belcht from thy base brest. Were Ouid liuing, hee would discommend thee: Horace, in steed of wine, would water send thee: And famous Uirgill, in his lofty stile, At this thy rayling humor would but smile. Last, all that haue deseru'd a Lawrell wreath, Vnto thy Muse a paire of sculls bequeath. Alas poore Spong, thou suckst vp nought but spight, And dost me open wrong thy faults to right. What coxcomb-foole would proffer such abuses, As thou hast done to Poets, and the Muses? But deare Talia in her ryming fit, Sung, Thou wilt die a foole, for want of wit. Thou saist thy iudgement can compose a verse; What my opinion's of thee, I'll rehearse, Thou art no better then a Poets Whelpe, That fauning vp and downe seekes after helpe: I could be like thy selfe, vnmannerly, But that I scorne thy stile should tutor me. No, burne thy selfe out, like a candle-snuffe, 'Tis vaine to make thee worse, th'art bad enuffe. Thou taxest me, that I abroad doe vaunt, What Lords &amp; Knights to me their fauors graunt; It also seemes that thou from mee would'st know, What Countesses and Ladies count'nance shew. I'll tell thee plainly; such doe entertaine mee, That for thy rayling basenesse will disdaine thee. Had they thy hungry chapps once foddered, Thou wouldst not title them embrodered. But, Syrra, though you meddle with your mates, Thou shouldst learn manners to forbeare the states: And not to descant vpon Court and King, 'Twere fitter thou shouldst of a Sculler sing. Presumptuous foole, how dar'st thou be so bold, To speake of Kings, whom men with feare behold. You say, you know his royall Maiesty Will not allow his Court to harbour me: Nay more, your Scullership doth know right well, That I no longer in his house shall dwell. Is then his wisedome think'st thou such meane treasure, That Water-men must know his royall pleasure? Yet I confesse so farre his will they know, When he directs them whither they shall goe. It may bee thou wast put in office lately, Which makes thee rogue me so, and rayle so stately. But when thy head peepes through the pillory, I doubt these termes thy eares must iustifie. For thy base words are of such hard digestion, They'l cause some stomack call thy name in questi?, Thou hopst to see me whipt; stand fast blind Hodge, For feare thou stumble into th'Porters Lodge: Raue, rayle, doe what thou canst, I'l neuer cease, To serue my soueraigne master King of peace. VVatch till thy eyes fall out; VVrite, do thy worst; I haue a Penne and Inkhorne is as curst, To answere all thy Rayling, Satyrizing, In three daies, what thou three months art deuising: And when thy quarter-Cockatrice sees light, In troth it is not worthy of mans sight. But I am sorry that thy credit's tainted, To make thee and thy Chaundler vnacquainted: VVill he not score no more for Egges and Cheese, Because he saw thy Hope vpon her knees? Rather then thou shouldst lay that fault on me, Come where I dwell, I'l passe my word for thee: For Reputation thou canst haue no more, Then in a Bakers debt, or Ale-wifes score: And if thou be deni'd both Bread and Drinke, Thy Writing and thy Rowing's like to shrinke. Leaue these Inuectiues, trust vnto thy Scull, For that's the way to fill thy belly full Of Meat and Drinke; besides this Consolation, Thou labor'st truly in thine owne Vocation. Why shouldst thou stagger after Poesie, That is attended on by Pouerty? I wish thee as my friend, ne'r goe about it; For, as I guesse, th'art poore ynough without it. I see thou art so bare and desperate, Thou wouldst turne Hangman to aduance thy state; And hang vp me: but (Sculler) I'l o'r-match you, And stand to see a Hempen halter catch you: For the old prouerbe neuer sailed yet, Who spreads nets for his friends, snares his owne feet: But yet I wonder since thou hat'st my life, Thou shouldst professe such kindnesse to my wife, If thy hot loue without deceit be feruent, My kitchin Maide shall take thee for her seruant: For all the loue that from my wife proceeds, Is scorning of thy person and thy deeds: Thou calst them wittols that lead quiet liues, But none but Rascals will abuse their wiues. But now to the disasters of the day, How thou miscarriedst with thy Hopefull play. Of thy mishaps no long discourse I'll tell, How thou amongst them mad'st a beastly smell. Thou dost commend the Players for their action, But they were all asham'd of thy distraction: For them, as much as thine, my praise allow, For none amongst them plaid the foole but thou: Thou wouldst faine find a fault, yet knowst not where, When in thy bosome it appeareth cleare. Thy chiefest rayling and thy strongst euasion, Is against me, yet thou art the occasion. Another while thou blam'st the Audience, When thou wast cause of their impatience: The better sort said I was wise enuffe, To keepe me out of that blacke whirle-wind puffe, Which almost blew the hangings from the Stage; Was e'r such folly knowne in any age? Thou sayst, the Maundering Begger credit got, For that, thou knowst I know a Poet wrot: For all the rest, that was deuisde by thee, Was nothing but a heape of Fopperie. I heard, thou letst the Wine run tumbling downe Thy rotten wind-pipe, like a drunken, Clowne: But yet thy Lion drunke could not defend thee, For 'twas thy Ape drunke made some men c?mend thee: For that daies censure thou canst not escape, Which sayes, That all thy actions plaid the Ape. But thy Tobacco was such stinking stuffe, That all the people cry'd, Enough, enough. Thy third Act shew'd the humors of men frantick, Wherin, most like an Asse, thou stoodst for Anticke: I saw it not, whether it were good or bad; But wise men iudge thee either foole, or mad. Thy last Act shewes thy skill vpon the Seas, To be so rare, it did them all displease: And in conclusion, such a tempest rose, That blew thee off, and made thy friends thy foes. And wouldst thou load my back with all this blame? Nay, as thou got'st the coyne, so take the shame: And let me tell thee this, to calme thy rage, I chaleng'd Kendall on the Fortune Stage; And he did promise 'fore an Audience, For to oppose me, note the accidence: I set vp Bills, the people throng'd apace, With full intention to disgrace, or grace; The house was full, the trumpets twice had sounded; And though he came not, I was not confounded, But slept vpon the Stage, and told them this; My aduerse would not come: not one did hisse; But flung me Theames: I then extempore Did blot his name from out their memorie, And pleasd them all, in spight of one to braue me, Witnesse the ringing Plaudits that they gaue me. Was not this iust the ease 'twixt me and thee? And yet thy eyes, thine owne faults cannot see. I'l touch thee neerer: Hadst thou beene away, As I was, and my selfe suppli'd the day, I would haue rows'd my Muse incontinent, With Mirths best quaint deuise, for their content; And in extempore I would haue gain'd The fauour of them all, which thee disdain'd. But thou art hatcht from Saturnes frozen braine, Poore drowsie groome of sleepy Morpheus traine: If there be any sparke of Muse in thee, It is the tayle-gut of Melpomenie, Which doth instruct thee in thy filthy tearmes; There's nothing else in thee my Penne affirmes. Hadst thou done well, the credit had beene thine; But doing ill, thoud'st haue the shame be mine. The Money pleasd thy humor passing well; But thy discredit made thy anger swell Aboue the verge of Patience and thy Sayle, Blowne full of Enuy, bursts it selfe to Rayle, Not publikely, but in a priuate Hole Kindle thy Malice at the Diuels coale: But I with water of true Honesty Will quench the raging heat of Villany. How brauely thou canst brag it out, and swagger, And talk of stabbes (God blesse vs) and thy dagger: I would not see thy spightfull spit-Frog drawne, 'Twill serue thee better for an Ale-house pawne. Thou scornst to foule thy fingers vpon men, Because thou knowst they will shake hands agen: But thou art excellent at these windy puffes, And darst encounter boyes at fifticuffes; But Sirrha, looke to your greene Wastcot well, For feare the boyes doe teare it off peecemell. All the kind fauour that I will implore, Is, that thou wouldst threaten me no more: And yet, now I remember, 'tis no wrong; For Threatned folke (the Prouerb sayes) liue long: But with thy Penne write, and reuenge thy spleene, I'l haue an Answere that shall cut as keene. But now base Slanderer, I must tearme thee so; Why medlest thou with them thou dost not know: Thus long I haue but spent my Inke in ieast, But now I'l dart my anger at thy breast: I would I had the humor of some Scold, That I, like thee, my venome might vnfold. Thou neuer knewst my birth, nor my begetting, So well as I thy Rascall Play, and Cheating: But whatsoe'r my birth or breeding bee, Spider, I liue to tosse and torture thee, Vse thee like Stock-fish, gill thee like a Sprat, Duck thee i'th Towne-ditch, like a Water-Rat, Make Iigges and Ballads of thy apish toyes, For to be sung by thred-bare Fidlers boyes: Yet to doe this, I shall but proue a babie, Thou hast disgrac'd thy selfe as much as may be. Thou Barrabas of all humanitie, Base slanderer of Christianitie, Know that I am a Christian, and am borne Better then thy best Kindred, I'l be sworne: How thy owne tongue thy breeding doth display, By Pedlers French, and Canting, Curds and Whay; And I'l approue it to thy foule disgrace, Th'art sprung from basenesse; I, from Gentries race: Which to make good, my Parents yet doe liue, And each day at their Table, food doe giue To better men then thou, mishapen slaue: Thus beare thy slanders with thee to thy graue. If I at Grausend rim'd for fourteene pence, For 12 pence thou hast row'd that voyage since: Allow it were no more, I bor't away With better credit, then thou didst thy Play. Thy enuie is not worth the speaking of; The more thou rail'st at me, the more I laugh: I scorne to begge (as thou dost) Poets phrases, To raise my name; let merit sing my praises: For were they meaner then thy owne desert, They were the worse where thou shouldst sing a part: Thou dost but thinke there's nothing good in me, But I am sure there is much lesse in thee. That hate thou bear'st me, prethee beare me still, My good with enuie all thy veines shall fill, Vntill they swell and burst thy angry gall: Then if I liue, I will lament thy fall, And on thy graue this Epitaph bestow, For to be read for either friend or foe. Epitaph. Here lyes a Carkasse in this Graue, Who while he liu'd, would rayle and raue, Borrow his wit from others worth, And in his owne name set it forth: He row'd from Tyber to the Thames, And there his tongue himselfe proclaimes, The luster of all Watermen, To row with Scull, or write with Pen. O, had he still kept on the Water, And neuer come vpon Theater, He might haue liu'd full merrily, And not haue di'd so lowsily. O, 'twas that foolish scuruie Play At Hope, that tooke his sence away: Yet he to blot out all his shame, Imputes the fault on Fennors name; And rayl'd at him like a mad bodie, Liu'd a bare Foole, di'd a base Noddie. But if you'l know what was his name, I willingly will shew the same: No Land-Poet, nor Sea-Saylor, But a poore Sculler, call'd Iohn Taylor: And had not hate this wonder slaine, He would haue liu'd a Knaue in graine. Thus Iack thou seest what friendship I would doe, Garnish thy Graue out with a verse or two; But yet thou art aliue, and I surmise, Thou wilt not dye till Crowes peck out thy eyes. I'd wish thee sayle vnto some forraine Places, Where they haue neuer heard of thy disgraces: The Baramoodes Tongue thou dost professe, The name of Poet there thou may'st possesse: There spread thy Pamphlets, make them vnderstand Thon art the chiefest Poet in that Land. Thou say'st my pate a mint of lyes can forge, Indeed t'hast wit ynough thy lyes to scourge: For I was neither rid South, North, nor East, But into Warwick-shire, direct North-west: Nor did I thither ride, to shun thy Play, But 'twas my Fathers will call'd me away; And for th'obedience that he in me found, He gaue me his blessing, with a hundred pound. Then Sculler know, that was no Tinkers gift, Nor had I need for thy poore Crowne to shift: But he that told thee I was gone in't Kent, Spoke halfe as true as thou dost, lies inuent. But see how enuie in thy heart doth trot, Thou grieuest that I a poore mans pardon got; Is thy eye euill then, 'cause mine is good? Or wouldst thou stop my Fountaine with thy mud? No, spight of thee, thou Canniball to man, I will not cease to doe what good I can: Nor doe I looke for Siluer for my meed, When poore men want, if I can helpe their need: For though thou rayld'st on me at the Beare garden, Rather then see thee hang'd, I'd beg thy pardon; Although it cost me more the suing forth, In ready money then thy Boat is worth: So much I tender man, though bred by Nature, As being image of his high Creator: But thou that of mans life art no esteemer, What mercy canst thou hope from thy Redeemer. Say I had wrong'd thee, thou good-names betrayer, Thou call'st for vengeance in thy Sauiours prayer: I will not say so, but it doth appeare, Thou scarce dost say thy prayers once a yeere. Thou must forgiue, if thou wouldst be forgiuen; For if thou fear'st not hell, ne'r hope for heauen. Thou dost accuse the King as well for Graunts, As men for Sutes: but leaue these bitter taunts, And learne in time, blacke tayle of insolence, To arme thy heart with Christian patience. Thus haue I answer'd all thy false alarmes: Now it remaines for me to blaze thy Armes; For thou hast falsely set vp mine in blue, Wherefore I meane to haue a bowt with you. Thy Heraldrie shall not out-strip my braine, But I'l deuise as good for thee againe: And first, because all Sculls thou dost excell, A siluer Oare will for thy Crest doe well, A paire of Armes bound in a Sable Scarffe, In a sad field, as large as Wapping Wharffe; Out of the water shall appeare one dead, A halter and a crosse-barre o'r his head; And on his Shield this Motto shall be found, Taylor the Sculler was both hang'd and drown'd. In all this blazing thee, no hurt I meane, But hang thee till the Tide hath washt thee cleane: And when the billowes o'r thy head are flowing, And Æolus 'gainst Neptunes brow is blowing, And Oares and Sculls aboue thy crosse-barre sailing, There is great hope thou wilt forget thy rayling. Thus haue I answer'd thee in three dayes space, And yet my Pen ranne but an ambling pace: Thus much I mildly write, in hope 'twill mend thee; If not, the Thames or Wapping shore will end thee. And last, to shew what course I would direct thee, Vse honesty, from Tiburne to protect thee. Thine more then thou desirest, Will. Fennor, his Maiesties Riming Poet. To my kinde Friends in generall. Now you haue read, and vnderstand my minde, I hope your wonted fauors I shall finde, In spight of rayling basenesse, whose lewd tongues Are Sathans instruments for sland'rous wrongs. Sure I haue satisfi'd your expectation, And vsde the Sculler in his owne vocation: But if you thinke my answer ouer-milde, Know this, I would not haue my tongue defilde, With such vnciuill tearmes, much lesse my pen, Which now giues satisfaction to all men Of truth; I will auouch, in spight of ill, My answer was set vp in Taylors Bill, Falsely, without my knowledge or consent: Then was not that a cause sufficient, To giue my purpose suddaine alteration, When I was plai'd the knaue with in that fashion. But though we could not then meet face to face, I hope my pen hath follow'd him apace: If I be not deceiu'd, it hath out-stript him, And spight of all his rods in pisse, 'tath whipt him, And made his howling hollow voyce to rore: Yet for your loues, I'l giue him one lash more. Fennors finall Fare-ill to Taylor, with his blue Bitch and Cods bellie. Bladder of enuie, one word more with you, I must hunt out your Bitch, of Azure hue: You that at Roterdam haue Spies to houer, And in Cods bellies transport Slanders ouer, And without Licence belcheth them abroad, 'Twere fit she should be seartcht to see her Load: For in her head, her bellie, and her crookes, I doubt there wil be found some dang'rous Bookes: For he that vndertooke this Worke for thee, Perhaps prints Romish Doctrine for a fee; Or matters preiudiciall to the State; Or things Schismaticall, to breed debate. If it be found so, spight of your Reuenge, You and your Bitch may in a halter swinge, And your Cods bellie starue for want of water: To you all three I doe commend this Satyre, And to my Country all my loue and skill, To root out all such instruments of ill. FINIS. A CAST OVER THE VVATER, BY JOHN TAYLOR. Giuen Gratis to William Fennor, the Rimer, From London to the Kings Bench. DEDICATED To all that vnderstand English. [He giues himselfe an honest good report] He giues himselfe an honest good report, And to himselfe he is beholden for't: Yet 'twixt the greatest knaue and him, I weene, Ther's thus much ods, A pair of sheers between. Master Fennors taking Boate. Come fellow Bull-beefe, quicke, thrust in the boat, Here comes a braue fare in a horsemans coat; Hold in man: Sir, lend me your worships hand, Take heed, t'hath rain'd, 'tis slippery Sir to stand. But sit you downe, we haue the winde and tide, Good Sir, a little on the Star-boord side. Thrust off now: I am glad I haue you here, Good Master Fennor (alias) Le Fognier: You are a fare falne to my lot diuinely, Trim you my Boat, and I will trim you finely: And as I Row, Ile tell you whom I am; I am Iohn Taylor made your Annagram. In defence of the true Annagram I made of William Fennor. Nv Uillany for mee. That I thy Annagram did truely finish, No letter did I adde, or none diminish: For which Nu Villany for me's the same, True Annagram of William Fennors name. Thou think'st to make thy Reputation stretch, And out of Normandy thy name wilt fetch: Where men may see thy folly plaine appeare, Thou wilt (forsooth) be called Le Fognier. Le Fognier, out alas thy wits are fogg'd; I can but laugh to see thee mir'd and bogg'd, But holla, holla, hobby, hold my fist, I'l helpe thee out of this blacke foggy mist. Le Foggnier. Annagramma. Flieng Roge. How lik'st thou this braue Annagram, 'tis true, And euery letter in his place, is due: And for thy further grace shal't haue another, Ile hardly do so much for mine owne Brother. Le Foggnier. Annagramma. Forge Lieng. Thou seest how I haue help'd thee at a pinch, And Annagramatiz'd thee to an inch: The sunshine of my Muse the Fog hath broke, And clear'd thy Name from out the misty smoake. Thou shew'st thy plenteous beggery of wit, That mak'st thy Annagram so much vnfit; Thy Name's but thirteene letters (as I weene) And in thy Annagram thou hast fifteene. Then William Fennor's Annagram's not such, I will feare no man, 'sE and A to much: I guesse (at first) thy Ancestors did keepe Within some fenny ground, Hogs, Kine, or sheep; And liuing Hogheards, or poore labring men, They tooke their Names of Fennor, from the Fen. And now to write a iest, my Muse doth smile, I thinke thou wast begotten on a stile: Thy father looking one way, and thy mother, For feare of being spide, she look'd another; And leering sundry waies, kept carefull watch, Lest any at their businesse should them catch. And that's the reason why thine eies doe rowle, And squint so in thy doltish iobbernowle. I cry thee mercy, in my other booke, Thy Coat of Armes I very much mistooke. As from the Fen at first thou didst suruiue, Thy Scutchion from the Fen I will deriue. Marke how I will emblaze thee, I'l be briefe, Within a Quagmire-field, two Toades in Chiefe, A Lope-staffe for the Bend, I hold it best, A paire of Oxe hornes Rampant, for the Crest, Well Mantled with an old Raw tough Cow-hide, Thus I my armes diuide, and subdiuide. For calling me a Taylor and a shred, A dish not worthy whereon to be fed; Could I but Cut, and sow, and steale and stitch As well as thou canst lye, I would be rich. The Time hath bin a Poor-Iohn's scraps would fill The hungry Maw of thredbare Lowzy Will. Thou hast forgot thou rim'st to me of late For sixteene Oysters once at Billingsgate, Thou hast forgot I gaue thee my old breeches, Because thou sung'st &amp; spok'st extrump'ry speeches When barly bread and Lamp oyle thou didst eate, A Poor-Iohn then with thee had bin good meat. Vpon his false Annagram on my name. Art not asham'd to be so false in print, Thy Muse is like thine Eyes (sure) all a squint, The world may see my name no E affords, And thou hast thrust in two, to make vp words; O hate rayle on, and then rayle on O hate, Thy wit, I see, is in a desp'rate state, Else thou wouldst neuer (vnto all mens view) Declare thy folly, printing things vntrue; For thine owne sake let Annagrams aloue, Thou canst not make a true one, then make none. To him I hold too vnworthy to be my foe: William Fennor. Thou hast look't ouer, I perceiue and seene, Th'inuectiue Scourge of my reuenging spleene, And wisely (as thou dem'st) thou weighest it lightly, Thou Gracelesse, disgrace thou esteemest slightly: There's not a bad word in it that is writ, But well thou knowst thou hast deserued it; And if I thought I ow'd thee any more, I would rayle on, till I had paid the score: For though my iust incensed anger sleepe, Yet doe I keepe my Satyres whip in weepe, In salt and brine, that to the quicke shall scourge Thee, or who dares my angry Muse to vrge. And by your leaue Sir, I'l a little firke yee, And with a milder lash I'l gently ierke yee. I will not rayle, or rogue thee, or be-slaue thee, But I will finely baffle, beard, and braue thee: I'l squeeze, &amp; crush, and vnto poulder pounce thee, I'l make thy wits for euer to renounce thee. I'l lay thee open, and I will attaint thee, And for a pittifull poore scab I'l paint thee. I'l nip, and strip, and whip thee out of breath, Like Bubonax, I'l rime thee vnto death. Thou sayst my verse is impotent and hault, Thou dost accuse me for thy onely fault; Alack in Rime thou canst doe naught but cobble, Thy cripled Verses vp and downe doe hobble. And doe so lamely runne, and rise, and fall, Like maimed Beggers in an Hospitall. Thou hast no iudging, vnderstanding eare, Thy Accents and thy Sillables to reare Or let them fall: thou botchest many a line, That I would shame to father such for mine. When a tressillable a verse doth end, 'Tis harsh, 'tis palty, and it doth offend; In a translation I with it would beare, But in Inuention it offends the eare: Thou often end'st thy lines with Memory, And then thou answer'st that with Pillory, And then thou comst vpon me Horribly, And in conclusion writ'st so lowsily, That when thou gett'st'a Poets dignity, I'l hang thee of mine owne benignity. Ther's many a fault thou mak'st which I wold show But that I feare 'twould make thee halfe a Poet, And well I know thou wouldst vnthankfull be, And wouldst deny thou learndst thy skill of me. I'l therefore leaue thee as a plague to time, A selfe-conceited witlesse Asse in Rime. I know thy ouer-daring minde doth dare With me and my inuention to compare, Indeed (by fortune) I some things haue done, Which many sayes from better wits did run. But let their enuious misconceit belye me, Nor thee, or they, or any dares to try me, But to the purpose, dar'st thou thus much doe Let one man giue one Theame betwixt vs two, And on that Theame let both of vs goe write, And he that best and soonest doth indite, Giue him the praise; and he that is out-strip'd (For his reward) let him be soundly whip'd. To this I dare thee, thou poore Poet Ape And I'l behang'd if thou a whipping scape. Thy Muse (or Mule) can frame some Riming notes, To borrow shillings, six-pences or Groates Of Vintners boyes, and that's the highest straine Thy borrowed stolne inuention can attaine. For thine owne credit some rare worke deuise, Turne into Verse the Chimney sweepers cries, Or worke for Tinker, Couers for close stooles, Then shalt thou be disputed on in Schooles, And held a braue man, and thy famous Verse About the Towne thy Patrons will rehearse. Besides, I wish thee beg the Monopolly, That to thy selfe thou maist ingrose it wholly, That none but thee may write the Elegies, And Epitaphs of Tiburne Tragedies. And so the Hangmans Poet thou shalt be, And sometimes haue as good a Fee as he: No course to thriue is to be counted base, And I'l speake for thee thou maist haue the place. I muse how Ladies dares to heare thy stile, 'Tis so abominable harsh and vile, How canst thou from them any fauour win, Me thinkes thy Rimes should fret their tender skin. For 'tis more rougher then a Russian Beare, And rubs and frets, and gaules each gentle eare. Thou art the rarest fellow aboue ground, To serue some Costiue Lord, that is hard bound, Thy riming would procure an easie stoole, That seruice hath some sauour, Goodman foole. The Doctors and Apothecaries swears, How they will lugge thee by the Asses eares Because thy riming now doth purge men more, Then all their Art in many yeeres before. Thou nam'st here, for a rabblement of fooles, Tom Coriat, Archy, and the great Otooles. Asse for thy selfe, a foole I ne'r did take thee, Dame Nature at the first (I thinke) did make thee One compound of two simples, Foole and Knaue, Who striuing in thee which should maistry haue, The crafty knauish part got all the sway, And turn'd the silly harmelesse Foole away: And in thy making Natures care was chiefe, To fashion thee on purpose for a Thiefe; Shee turn'd thine eyes keele vpwards, for the nonce, That thou might'st see fiue or six waies at once. For why, thou hast an admirable looke, T'informe a Thiefe, from windowes how to hooke Apparell, Cushions, Carpet, Rugge, or Sheete, That they withall by hooke, or crooke, can meete. I doe not say thou dost this trading vse; But therein thou thy making dost abuse, In that thou closely follow'st not the trade, For which thee &amp; thy thiefe-like eyes were made. When at a great mans house, men flocke about thee, 'Tis not to heare thee rime, but cause they doubt thee, And therefore euery one keeps carefull watch For feare thou should'st the plate, or so what catch: Thou thinkst they do applaud when thou hast rim'd, And they are fearefull that thy fists are lim'd. The Butlers sweat for feare, whil'st thou dost prate, And double diligently guard their plate. Thy beautious Phisnomy doth this, for which Most women feare thee, that thou art a Witch, And therefore snatch their children vp, and run, Thy ominous ill-looking looke to shun. For if before a Iudge, thou euer speake, Thy very countenance thy neck will breake. More I could say, and more I could deuise, But that I thinke I should rime out thine eyes; If all trades faile, I'd haue thee pull them out, And I'll procure thee liuing doe not doubt, I in thy nose will put an Iron ring, And lead thee vp and downe the Towne to sing, To Feasts, and Markets, Wakes, &amp; Sturbridge faire, And then to euery place with me repaire, I would aduance a faire ingrossed bill, That in these words should promise wondrous skill. Then I, or else my Boy, will beat a Drum, If any be desirous for to come, At two a clocke within the after noone, There shall you see an old blind braue Baboone, That can put on the humor of an Asse, Can come aloft Iack, heigh passe and repasse; That for ingenuous study downe can put, Old Holdens Camell, or fine Bankes his Cut, And for his action he eclipseth quite, The Iigge of Garlick, or the Punks delight. King Ninus motion, or the great tall Dutch-man, Or th'Elke, or man-Beare baiting was no such man. To all your costs he will his wis wits imploy, To play the second part of Englands Ioy. Hee'l rime, and sing well, and if need require, Can tell more lies then you would all desire. Our Lady Fayre, nor yet Saint Bartholomew, A motion like to this did neuer shew. These things I hope for to employ thee in, By which wee needs must store of money win. I neither hate good counsell, or yet thee, But why shouldst thou presume to counsell me. I prethee then leaue off thy fruitlesse taske, No godnesse comes from such a mustie Caske. My Defence against thy Offence. How proudly thou thy Ancestors dost praise, Aboue the Pleyades, their Fame to raise: Was euer seene so vile a paltry Nag, So much of his Antiquity to brag. As if his Grandam had some Burgesse beene, In Parlament vnto the Diamond Queene: If I should answer all thy base contention, I then should haue no roome for my inuention: And therefore famous Monsier Le Foggnier. I will but only nip thee here and there: According as I see the time and place, I will my byting phrases enterlace. And first (Don Bussard) vnto you 'tis knowne, The writing of my play was all mine owne: And though thou tearm'st it fopp'ry, like a fop, Into the Hangmans Budget thou wilt drop, Before thy muddie Muse (Dame ignorance) On a conceit so good, as it shall glance. Thou brag'st what fame thou got'st vpon the stage, Indeed, thou set'st the people in a rage, In playing Englands Ioy, that euery man Did iudge it worse then that was done at Swan. I neuer saw poore fellow so behist, T'applaud thee, few or none lent halfe a fist: Some stinkards hands, perhaps went pit to pat, Who ignorantly lik'd they knew not what; Besides, thou knowst, thou promist in thy Bill, In rare extempory to shew thy skill. When all thou spok'st, thou studiedst had before, Thou know'st I know, aboue a month and more. Besides, the best conceits that were in it, (Poore Foole) thou had'st them from a better wit, Then is thine owne, thy beggerly conceit Could ne'r haue mounted to so high a height. Good wine is spild, in stinking vessels leaking, And so good words were mar'd with thy ill speaking: Where like a Scar-crow) or a Iack of lent Thou stoodst, and gau'st the people small content: And yet thy impudence wouldst raise thy fame, From out the loathsome Garbage of thy shame. Thy little honesty so high thou deem'st, And more then Thames reuennew it esteem'st: Make much on't, thou art worthy to haue more, Thou mak'st such reck'ning of so little store. Thy honesty is bred within the bone, Out of the flesh, I thinke came neuer none: Thou sai'st I call'd a Christian, Cur, O fie! Will Fennor, wilt thou neuer leaue to lye? 'Twas thee I call'd so, ponder well vpon't, For I thinke thou wast neuer at a Font; I wish thee yet thy Baptisme to procure, Thou canst not be an Anabaptist sure: If I should answer euery lye and line, My booke would then be bigger far, then thine. Besides, it with my mind doth not agree, To paraphrase on thy poore stuffe and thee. Thou put'st one trick vpon me, and a rare one, Thou'lt make me vnder Sculler vnto Charon; When thou com'st to the Deuill on a message, Then I'l take nothing of thee for thy passage: And for my loue (then thine) shall not be shorter, Thou shalt be Plutoes vgly vnder Porter. For Cerberus and thee must needs agree, Thy one good face, accommodates his three. Thou bid'st me watch and write, and doe my worst, And sai'st, thy Pen and Inkehorne is as curst. I thinke 'tis curst indeed, for I protest, That neither thee, or them, was neuer blest: Perhaps thou hast good Paper, Pens, and Inke, But thy inuention (Fogh) how it doth stinke. Thou bid'st me fall vnto my Scull againe, And hold'st my calling in thy high disdaine. Know Peasant, if I were a Baron borne, Yet I my honest trade would neuer scorne: A Water-man doth get his bread more true, Then fifty thousand idle Knaues, like you; They cannot rime, and cony-catch, and cheat, For what they haue, they must be sure to sweat. And I esteeme my labour far more deare, Then all thy riming's worth in twenty yeere: I'l carry Whores and Knaues too, for my fee; For money, I'l transport thy wife and thee: I'l carry any body for my fare, Wee haue no power to question what they are. My Boat is like vnto a Barbers Chaire, To which both honest men, and Knaues repaire: No Trades-men, whatsoeuer that they be, Can get their liuing honester then we. We labour truly, and we take great paine, With hands and feet, we stretch out euery vaine: Thy hands did neuer worke, thou art so nice, Except 'twere in thy Doublet cracking lice. And not to brag, but to our trades great fame, The learned Sapho, that admired Dame, Who could the Saphicke Verse so rarely write, Did wed a Water-man, who Phaon hight: Besides, eight Kings, in famous Edgars raigne, To row with Oares did hold it no disdaine: But as Records and Chronicles relate, They row'd vnto the Parlament in State. Thou maist infer these Kings, were captiues all: Why? are not all men so by Adams fall. Nay more, when water the first world did end, The second world did presently descend, From the High Admirall of Heau'n and Earth, The Patriarke Noah, we had second birth: He ferri'd mankind to this worlds Lee shore, From the bar'd-hauen of the world, before Such Landsharkes as thy selfe, their way did take, Downe through the Deluge to Cocitus Lake, Where all the comfort the poore Caitiffes found, Was this, that all the Gallowses were drown'd: No Authors write, no not the Poets tales, That they lou'd Cheatry, Porposes, or Whales. One note this History doth more afford, That all were damb'd that scorn'd to lie aboord, No part of this world we inherit can, But by our Title from a Waterman. Then wrong not vs with thy calumnious tongue, For from a Waterman we all are sprung: From Iaphets Ioynes I well descended am, And thou (my cursed Couzin) cam'st from Cham. Besides thus much, thy Ignorance may note, That all the world may well be cal'd a Boat, Tost on the troublous waues of discontent, All subiect vnto change, vnpermanent. Our life's the tide, which euer ebbes and flowes, And to their iournies end all Creatures rowes: The Souldier with his sword rowes vp and down. And floats in bloud sometimes to gaine a Crown. The Lawyer rowes, and makes his tongue his oare, And sometimes sets his Clyent poore ashoare. But the Deuine (of all men) he rowes best. He brings vs safely to the Port of rest: He lands vs at our euerlasting Inne, And the tenth penny for his paines doth winne. Thus Fennor thou mai'st see, that Watermen Are farre beyond the limits of thy Pen To doe them wrong; I could speake more of this, But that I thinke enough sufficient is. Thou sai'st that Poetry descended is From pouertie, thou tak'st thy markes amisse. In spight of weale or woe, or want of pelfe, It is a Kingdome of content it selfe. A Poet's here or there, or where he please, In Heau'n, in Ayre, in Earth, in Hell, or Seas, Gods, men, fish, fowle, beasts, and infernall fiends, All tributary homage to him sends; They're called makers, for they'l vndertake By Art, of nothing something for to make, And though in making, little skill I haue, Yet could I easily make thee a Knaue. But therein I should be but thy partaker, A Knaue thou art, and so art thine owne maker. In which thou dost most makers much excell, For hauing made thy selfe so ill, so well. And now at thee, once more I'l haue a fling, Thou saist thou hadst thy title from the King Of riming Poet: I beleeue it true. What name would best befit thee, well he knew, He call'd thee not a Poet, for deuising, Or that thou couldst make ought worth memorizing, He call'd thee riming Poet, note why 'twas, And I will shew thy picture in a Glasse: He gaue thy Poetry not Reasons Name; But Rime, for he knew well his words to frame. Now what a Rimer is, vnto a Poet, Because thou knowst it not, I'l make thee know it: Th'are like Bell-ringers to Musicians, Or base Quack-saluers to Phisicians; Or as a Zany to a Tumbler is, A Rimer's to a Poet such as this; And such art thou, or in a worse degree: For if a Poet should examine thee Of Numbers, Figures, Trimeters, Alchaicks, Hexameters, Pentameters, Trochaicks, Iambicks, Allegories, and Allusions; With Tropes, Similitudes, Types and Conclusions: And whosoeuer chanceth but to looke In Chaucer, or th'Arcadia (well writ Booke) Shall find these Rules which I before haue nam'd, Which makes a Poets Art for euer fam'd: And in these things, thy knowledge is no more Then hath an Asse, a Horse, a Beare, or Bore. Thou art the Rump, the taile, or basest part Of Poetry, thou art the dung of Art. Thou art all Rime, and voyd of reason, thou Dost cloz: and shut vp lines, no matter how. Some men will say, I must a Scholler be, Or else these words could neuer come from me: To them I answer; I can English read, But further I could neuer write or plead: Those words of Art, I know them euery one, And knowing them, I'l let them all alone; Because I doe not know well how to vse them, And by misplacing them, I may abuse them. When I a learned word in Verse doe plant, I will be sure to write significant. So much to them, whose hearts will not beleeue But that in Poetry I filch and theeue. I dare them all to try me, and leaue threatning, The proofe of pudding's alwaies in the eating: Thus I haue told thee, why, wherefore, and how His Maiesty did thee that name allow; The name of Rimer carry to thy graue, But stile of Poet, thou shalt neuer haue. Search well in Turn-bull street, or in Pickt-hatch, Neere Shorditch, or Long-alley prethee watch, And 'mongst the trading females, chuse out nine To be thy Muses, they will fit thee fine, They'l make thy rimes and thee of more account, And mount thy fame aboue Parnassus Mount: Thou writst a hotch-potch of some forty lines About my Play at Hope, and my designes; Where men may see thy stocke of wit is poore, To write of that which I had writ before. Thou fill'st thy Booke with my inuention full, And shew'st thy selfe an idle shallow Gull: And then thou talk'st &amp; prat'st, and keep'st a Rut, And tearm'st my Muse Melpomones Tayle Gut; I wonder where thou didst that phrase procure, Thou art beholden to some Tripe-wife sure. When hunger doth prouoke thee rime and sing, That Gut will make thy Muse a Chitterling; For thou from tripes, and tayl-guts, &amp; hogs mawes, Hast won thy greatest credit and applause, There's none that eats a Partridge or a Pheasant, But takes thee for a foole to make them pleasant, I know not if thy wife be he or shee, If she be honest, shee's too good for thee. Thou partly offrest me to hold the dore, If I will make thy Kitchin-maid my whore: But prethee hold thy prating, witlesse Gander, Shalt ne'r haue honor to become my Pander. Thou saist, I raile, 'tis true, I had decreed To giue my wronged Muse a purge with speed, And (as the fittest vessell) 'twas thy lot, To be her foule vnworthy Chamber-pot: Shee's well recouer'd, and the world doth see Her filthy excrements remaine in thee. No blacke contagious mist her pure light suffers, But strait she makes of thee a paire of Snuffers, To make her glorious greatnesse shine more cleere, And this shall be your office Le Fogniere. And now a thought into my mind doth creepe, How thou a Kitchin or a Maid canst keepe: I know the time thou wouldst haue lick'd thy chaps From out an Almes-basket to get some scraps, And hast thou now a Kitchin and large roomes, To entertaine faire Lasses, and braue Groomes? I see thou art the frugal'st Lad aliue, And car'st not greatly what thou dost to thriue. I wrongly call'd thy Kitchin-seruant, maid; No maid can dwell with thee, I am afraid: And now a pretty tale I meane to tell; Marke it, I prethee, for it fits thee well. There was a fellow once some faults had done, Which fearing hanging, did his Country run, And comming to the City, full of feare, (Nay note my tale, good Mounsier Le Fognier) In hope to get his pardon, 'twas his chance Vpon a man, (as might be thee) to glance, The poore distressed fellow told his mind, And said, If any man would be so kind To get his pardon, and to set him free, He should haue threescore angels for his Fee: Now he that this mans pardon should procure, (To saue his owne stake, and to make all sure) He leaues the Thiefe in London, and strait went And brought a Hoy full of his goods from Kent, Then out of hand, this man like thee, call'd Momus Did hire a goodly building called Domus, Which this thiefs houshold-stuffe did furnish well, And there this Gentleman (like thee) doth dwell. Now to proceed, the poore vnhappy thiefe Is ready still to hang himselfe with griefe: For he is cheated of his goods, I wot, And knowes not when his pardon will be got. And 'tis much fear'd, the Cheater his owne selfe, Will worke some meanes to hang him for his pelfe. How lik'st thou this, i'st not a pretty trick? But wherefore dost thou chafe, and spurn and kick: A guilty conscience feeles continuall feare, And this discourse doth seem to touch thee neare: Nay, then I will relate another thing, Which I suppose will make you wince and fling. Vpon S. Georges day last, Sir, you gaue To eight Knights of the Garter (like a Knaue) Eight Manuscripts (or Bookes) all fairely writ, Informing them they were your Mother wit, And you compild them; then were you regarded, And for anothers wit was well rewarded. All this is teue, and this I dare maintaine, The matter came from out a learned braine: And poore old Vennor, that plaine dealing man, Who acted Englands Ioy first at the Swan, Paid eight crownes for the writing of these things, Besides the couers, and the silken strings: Which money baeke he neuer yet receiu'd, So the deceiuer is by thee deceiu'd. First, by those Bookes thou stol'st a good report, And wast accounted a rare man in Court: Next, thou didst much abuse those Noble-men, And kild'st their bounty, from a Poets Pen. And thirdly, thou a Poet didst beguile, To make thy selfe the Author of his stile. And last, thou shewst thy cheating good and euill, Beguiling him, that could beguile the Deuill. Thou highly hast prouok'd the Muses fury, Twelue Poets are empaneld for thy Iury; Then William Fennor, stand vnto the Bar, Hold vp thy hand, here thy accusers are: Art guilty or not guilty of those crimes Thou art accus'd, th'ast stole fiue thousand rimes, From But ends of old Ballads, and whole books, What saist thou for thy selfe, hold vp thy lookes? He falters, and his words are all vnsteady, Poore fellow looks as he were hangd already. His silence doth affirme these things are true, And therefore let the Bench in order due Giue sentence, that within a hempen string He at S. Thomas Wat'rings may goe swing: And for he liu'd the wonder of our time, Do him this honor, hang him vp in rime. A Sirrha, is the matter falne out so, Must thou Extemp'ry to the Gallowes goe, For old atquaintance, e'r thou breathe thy last, I o'r the Water wiil giue thee A Cast. And till the halter giue thy necke a wrench, Thou shalt haue time and space in the Kings Bench, To Con and fesse, and to repent thy fill, And to dispose thy goods, and make thy will: Which being done, and thou well hang'd and dead, This Epitaph vpon thy graue I'l spread, That passers by may read, and reading see How much thou art beholden vnto me. Epitaph. He that could alwayes lye, doth lye Sixe foote below thy feet: Of any colours he could dye His lyes, to make them meet. In lyes vntrue he spent his youth, And truly dead, lies here in truth. How saist thou Fennor, is not all this worth Thy harty thanks, which I haue here set forth: If not, thou shew'st thy selfe the more ingratefull, Which vice, is to the very Diuell hatefull. Thou didst belye me when thou saidst I threat thee, For rather then I would doe so, I'd beat thee: And 'twere the easier taske of both by halfe, But who will foule his fists on such a Calfe; A Calfe said I, for age thou dost appeare To be a Bull, or Oxe, th'art past a Steere. Thou liest againe, accusing me of Griefe, Because thou gotst a pardon for a Thiefe. Why should I grieue at that was neuer done, The pardon yet I'm sure thou hast not-won, The poore man he hath cause to grieue enuffe, For being Cheated of his houshold stuffe. Thou bragg'st and prat'st how charity and loue Of mankind, onely did thy pitty moue, And not desire of siluer for thy paine Did make thee seeke his pardon to attaine. And then (as if thou wert deuour'd with zeale) Thy false hypocrisie thou dost reueale. In our Contentious writing 'tis vnfit That any word of Scripture should be writ, The name of God is to be feard with trembling, And thou mak'st it a Cloke for thy dissembling; Shall Raskall Rimes, profane vnhallowed things, Be mixt with naming the great King of Kings. The onely one in three, and three in one; Let him and all his Attributes alone. Thou saist before that I should hanged be, How thou a pardon woudst procure for me. Before it come to that, I'l end the strife, And hang before I'l thanke thee for my life: But sure thy gilt of conscience wondrous great is, Else thou wouldst ne'r write thy repenting treatis, Perswading me to patience and forgiue, This shewes thou some abuse to me didst giue, To make me cry Vindicta, and requite My wrongs, before all misconceiuers fight. As for my Arm's th'ast giu'n me quit for quo. Thou must to Tyburn, I to Wapping goe, But I haue gotten a Reprieue, and can Well proue my selfe to be an honest man. My Muse for thee a Habeus Corpus brings, From Tyburne to Saint Thomas Waterings. An Epilogue. I told thee I had worser rods in pisse, Thou findst it true, and I haue worse then this, Which on occasion I will freely vtter, If thou but dare against me for to mutter: In three daies thou didst write that book of thine Thou saist, and I in fourteene houres did mine. For I would haue thee well to vnderstand, I businesse haue by water and by land, My seruice and occasions me incites To write by snatches, and by spurts a nights. That if my businesse were but ouer-past, The writing such another, I durst fast From sleepe, or sustenance of meat or drinke, And such a taske would famish thee I thinke. I for a wager will be locked vp, And no reliefe will either bite or sup, Vntill as much as this my muse deuise, And scarcely be an hungred when I rise. Then for thine owne sake (Poet Pedler) cease, Or bind my sharpe fang'd Muse vnto the peace: For thou maist sweare, &amp; keep thy conscience cleere That of thy life thou liu'st in mighty feare. Shee'l make thee desp'rate, thine owne breath bereaue, By which, she Hangman thou wilt much deceiue, Thus doe I leaue my lines to all mens view, To iudge if I haue paid thee not thy due. To write of thee againe, my Muse hath ceast, Sufficient is enough, enough's a feast. I know thy lying Chaps are stopt for euer, That all thy study and thy best endeuour, Nor fifty more such shallow brains as thine, Can answere this one little booke of mine. But if thou dost, I know 'twill be so lame, A wise man will not reade it o'r for shame, And therefore Fennor gnaw vpon this bone, What next I write, shall better be or none. Taylors defence of the honesty of his Blew-Bitch. Now Fennor once more I'l giue thee a twitch For hunting hotly after my Blue Bitch: Beware she doth not teare thee by the throat. She's neither Salt, nor hot, I'd haue thee know't. Thou (like a Hound) perhaps maist licke her taile, But further all thy wits cannot preuaile: I wish thee from thy Kennell not to roame, But for thine owne tooth keep thy Brache at home. My Bitch will bite thee sorely, I am sure. And where she fangs, 'tis commonly past cure. At honest men shee'l neuer cry baw waw, But she will snarle, and snap such knaues as thou. As for my Cod let her be op'd and rip'd, Let her be search'd to see what she hath ship'd, And nothing in her all the world can see, But sharpe Satyricke whips to torture thee. His Landing. Now here Iland thee at S. Mary Awdries, I think not for your worships w?ted bawdries I know your businesse is not for a wench, The Tipstaffe tels me you are for the Bench, Where you may feed your Muse on Carrat rootes, And lie a bed, borrow no shooes or bootes, And liue within the rules, a good thing truly, For such a man as you that liue vnruly: Farewell, and yet I'l visit you againe, When in a Rugg you Clamor at the Chaine. And once againe when it falls to your lot, Below your eare to weare the pendant knot. Meane space because you are a merry Greeke, I'l send thee bread and pottage thrice a weeke. FINIS. The praise of cleane Linnen. VVITH THE COMMENDABLE VSE OF THE LAVNDRES. DEDICATED TO THE MOST MONDIFYING, CLARIFYING, PVRIFYING, AND REPVRIFYING, CLEANSER, Clearer, and Reformer of deformed and polluted Linnen, Martha Legge Esquiresse, transparent, vnspotted, Snow Lilly-white Laundresse to the Right worshipfull and generous the Innes of Court, of the middle Temple, with diuers others in the ranke of Nobility, Gentility, and tranquility: your poore and vnknowne Poeticall Oratour Iohn Taylor, in humility and seruility, craues your Patronages ability, in defence of his imbecility. My Muse no tydings brings from Prester Iohn, Nor from the Fridgide or the Torrid Zone: She hath not search't Americaes vast bounds, Nor forag'd ouer Affricks scorched grounds; For this here vnder writ I trauel'd not Vnto the Welch, the Irish, or the Scot: To Towne nor Citty did I make repaire, Nor did I buy in Market or in Faire This Linnen treasure, but in Bed alone, Where (cares except) Bed-fellow had I none. My drowzy Muse awak'd, and straight she meets This wel-beloued subiect, 'twixt the sheets. Yet though not farre my Muse for it did rome, I did accept it when she brought it home, And taking pen in hand, I 'gan to write, What you may read, and reading take delight. And O sweet Linnen, humbly I implore, (Though of thee I haue no aboundant store) Yet, for I am thy seruant at this time, And with my Muse attend thee with my rime, Assist thy Poet, neuer let him lacke A comely, cleanly shirt vnto his backe. Cleane Linnen is my Mistris, and my Theame Flowes, like an ouer-flowing plenteous streame, But first I will discouer what I meane, By this same seemly word, which men call Cleane: As Titans light's offenciue to the Owle, So, Cleane is opposite to what is foule: Yet (in the ayre) some flying Fowle there are, Which tane, and cleanly drest, are Fowle cleane fare, But fouly drest, when it is fairely tooke: Foule is that Fowle, a foule ill take that Cooke. But to the word cal'd Cleane, it is allotted, The admirable Epithite Vnspotted, From whence all soyl'd pollution is exiled, And therefore Cleane is called vndefiled: 'Tis faire, 'tis clarifi'd, 'tis mundifi'd, And from impurity is purifi'd. But to be truly Cleane is such a state, As gaines the Noble name immaculate: And I wish all mankind the grace might win, To be (as here I meane) all Cleane within. As 'tis no grace a man a man to be, If outward forme want inward honesty: So Linnen if with (Cleane) it be not grac'd, 'Tis noysome, lothsome, and it giues distaste. As Vertue man or woman doth adorne, So (Cleane) is Linnens vertue; and is worne For pleasure, profit, and for ornament, Throughout the Worlds most spacious continent. Much more of this word (Cleane) might here be writ, But tediousnesse is enemy to wit, Cleane Linnen now my verse descends to thee, Thou that preordinated wert to be, Our Corps first Couer, at our naked birth: And our last garment when we turne to Earth. So that all men Cleane Linnen should espie, As a Memento of mortalitie: And that a Sheet vnto the greatest State, Is th' Alpha and Omega of his fate. As at our births Cleane Linnen doth attend vs, So doth it all our whole liues race befriend vs; Abroad, at home, in Church or Common-wealth, At bed, or boord, in sickenesse and in health. It figures forth the Churches puritie, And spotlesse Doctrine, and integritie: Her State Angelicall, white innocence, Her nursing loue, and bright magnificence. Yet some for Linnen doe the Church forsake, And doe a Surplice for a Bug-beare take. But alwayes to the Church I bring mine eares, Not eyes to note what roabes Church-men weares: Now from the Church, let vs returne but home. And there the cloth is laid against you come: Though raging hunger make the Stomacke wroth, 'Tis halfe asswag'd by laying of the Cloth. For in the warres of eating 'tis the vse, A Table of cloth is hungers flagge of Truce: Whilst in the fight the Napkins are your friends, And wait vpon you, at your fingers ends. Your Dinner and your Supper ouer-past, By Linnen in your beds, you are imbrac'd, Then, 'twixt the sheetes refreshing rest you take, And turne from side to side, and sleepe and wake: And sure the sheetes in euery Christian Nation Are walles or limits of our generation; For where desire, and loue, combined meets, Then there's braue doings 'twixt a paire of sheets: But where a Harlots lust doth entertaine, There one sheets pennance, bides the shames of twaine: To all degrees my counsaile here is such That of the lower sheet, take not too much. As from our beds we doe oft cast our eyes, Cleane Linnen yeelds a shirt before we rise, Which is a garment shifting in condition, And in the Canting tongue is a Commission: In weale or woe, in ioy or dangerous drifts, A shirt will put a man vnto his shifts. For vnto it belongs this fatall lot, It makes him shift that hath, or hath it not. The man that hath a shirt doth shift and change, And he that hath no shirt doth shift and range, So the conclusion of this point must fall, He shifteth most that doth not shift at all. Besides, a shirt, most magically can Tell if it's owner be an honest man: The washing will his honesty bewray, For, the lesse soape will wash his shirt, they say. Most men Cleane shirts at such esteeme doe prize, That the poor'st thiefe, who at the gallowes dyes, If but his shirt is cleane, his mind is eas'd, He hangs the hansomer, and better pleas'd. Next, at the smocke I needs must haue a flirt, (Which is indeed the sister to a shirt) 'Tis many a females Linnen tenement, Whilest twixt the quarters she receiues her rent. A Smock's her store-house, or her ware-house rather, Where shee her commings in doth take and gather. Her gaines by it are more then can be told, 'Tis her reuenue, and her copy-hold, Her owne fee simple, shee alone hath power, To let and set at pleasure euery houre: 'Tis a commodity that giues no day, 'Tis taken vp, and yet yeelds ready pay. But for most other wares, a man shall bee Allow'd for payment dayes three months and three. Yet hath a smocke this great preheminence, (Where honour's mix'd with modest innocence) It is the Roabe of married chastitie, The vaile of Heauen-belou'd Virginitie, The chaste concealem?t of those fruits close hidden, Which to vnchaste affections are forbidden, It is the Casket or the Cabinet, Where Nature hath her chiefest Iewels set: For whatsoe'r men toyle for, farre and neere, By sea or land, with danger, cost, and feare, Warres wrinkled brow, &amp; the smooth face of peace, Are both to serue the smocke, and it's increase. The greatest Kings, and wisest Counsellours, Stout Soldiers, and most sage Philosophers, The welthiest Merchants, and Artificers, Pleibeians, and Plow-toyling labourers, All these degrees, and more haue woo'd and praid, And alwayes to the smocke their tributes paid. Besides, 'tis taken for a fauour great, (When one his mistris kindly doth intreat) He holds these words as Iewels dropt from her, You first shall doe as doth my Smocke, sweet Sir. This Theame of smocke is very large and wide, And might (in verse) be further amplifide: But I thinke best a speedy end to make, Lest for a smel-smocke some should me mistake: I first began it with a flirt or flout, And ending, with a mocke, I will goe out. The Anagram of Smocke I find is Mockes, And I conclude, A pox of all strait smockes. Now vp aloft I mount vnto the Ruffe, Which into foolish mortals pride doth puffe: Yet Ruffes antiquity is here but small, Within this eighty yeeres, not one at all; For the eighth Henry, (as I vnderstand) Was the first King that euer wore a Band, And but a falling Band, plaine with a hem, All other people knew no vse of them, Yet imitation in small time began, To grow, that it the Kingdome ouer-ran: The little falling-bands encreac'd to Ruffes, Ruffes (growing great) were waited on by Cuffes, And though our frailties should awake our care, We make our Ruffes as carelesse as we are: Our Ruffes vnto our faults compare I may, Both carelesse, and growne greater euery day. A Spaniards Ruffe in follio, large and wide, Is th'abstract of ambitions boundlesse pride. For roundnesse 'tis the Embleme, as you see, Of the terrestriall Globes rotunditie, And all the world is like a Ruffe to Spaine, Which doth encircle his aspiring braine, And his vnbounded pride doth still persist, To haue it set, and poaked as he list. The sets to Organ-pipes, compare I can, Because they doe offend the Puritan, Whose zeale doth call it superstition, And Badges of the Beast of Babilon. Ruffes onely at the first were in request, With such as of abilitie were best: But now the plaine, the stich'd, the lac'd, and shagge, Are at all prices worne by tagge, and Ragge. So Spaine (who all the world would weare) shall see, Like Ruffes, the world from him shall scat'red bee. As for the Cuffe 'tis pretily encreast, (Since it began, two hand fuls at the least:) At first 'twas but a girdle for the wrist, Or a small circle to enclose the fist, Which hath by little and by little crept; And from the wrist vnto the elboe leap't, Which doth resemble sawcy persons well, For giue a Knaue an inch, hee'l take an ell. Ruffes are to Cuffes, as 'twere the breeding mothers, And Cuffes are twins in pride, or two proud brothers. So to conclude, Pride weares them for abuse, Humilitie, for ornament and vse, A Night-cap is a garment of high state, Which in captiuitie doth captiuate The braine, the reason, wit, and sense and all, And euery night doth beare sway capitall. And as the horne aboue the head is worne, So is the Night-cap worne aboue the horne, And is a Sconce or Block-house for the head, Wherein much matter is considered, And therefore (when too much wee sucke the tap) 'Tis truly called a considering Cap. By day it waits on Agues, Plurifies, Consumptions and all other malladies, A day worne Night-cap, in our Common-wealth, Doth shew the wearer is not well in health: Yet some mens folly makes my muse to smile, When for a kib'd heele, broken shin, or bile, Scab'd hams, cut fingers, or a little sear, A Groyne Bumpe, or a Goose from Winchester: When I see Night-caps worne for these poore vses, It makes my worship laugh at their abuses. Thus is a Night-cap most officious, A Captaine, Captious, and Capritious, And though vnmarried young men may forbeare it, Yet age, and wedlocke makes a man to weare it. A Handkerchiefe may well be cal'd in briefe, Both a perpetuall leacher, and a thiefe, About the lippes it's kissing, good and ill, Or else 'tis diuing in the pocket still, As farre as from the pocket to the mouth, So is it's pilgrimage with age or youth. At Christning-banquets and at funerals, At weddings (Comfit-makers festiuals) A Handkerchiefe doth filch most manifold, And sharke and steale as much as it can hold. 'Tis soft, and gentle, yet this I admire at, At sweet meates 'tis a tyrant, and a pyrat. Moreouer 'tis a Handkerchiefes high place, To be a Scauenger vnto the face, To clense it cleane from sweat and excrements, Which (not auoyded) were vnsauory scents; And in our griefes it is a trusty friend, For in our sorrow it doth comfort lend: It doth partake our sighes, our plaints and feares, Receiues our sobs, and wipes away our teares. Thus of our good and bad it beares a share. A friend in mirth a comforter in care. Yet I haue often knowne vnto my cost, A Handkerchiefe is quickly found, and lost. Like loue where true affection hath no ground. So is it slightly lost, and lightly found; But be it ten times lost, this right I'l doe it, The fault is his or hers that should looke to it. Should I of euery sort of Linnen write, That serues vs at our need, both day and night, Dayes, months and yeeres, I in this Theame might spend And in my life time scarcely make an end. Let it suffice that when 'tis fretted out, And that a cloth is worne into a clout, Which though it be but thin and poore in shape, A Surgeon into lint the same will scrape, Or rolles, or bolsters, or with plaster spread, To dresse and cure, all hurts from heele to head, For gangrens, vlcers, or for wounds new hack'd, For cuts, and slashes, and for Coxcombs crack'd. Thus many a Gallant that dares stab and swagger, And 'gainst a Iustice lift his fist or dagger: And being mad perhaps, and hot pot-shot, A crazed Crowne or broken-pate hath got; Then ouer him old Linnen domineeres, And (spight of's teeth) it clouts him 'bout the eares. Thus new or old, it hath these good effects, To cure our hurts, or couer our defects: And when it selfe's past helpe, with age and rending, Quite past selfe mending, 'tis our means of m?ding, The flint and steele will strike bright sparkling fire; But how can wee haue fire at our desire, Except old Linnen be to tinder burn'd, Which by the steele and flint to fire is turn'd? Thus all Cleane Linnen that a Laundresse washes, My Muse hath worne to clowts, or turn'd to ashes. And ther's the end on't. Now I must pursue, (The old consumed) how to purchase new. Now of the louely Laundresse, whose cleane trade Is th'onely cause that Linnen's cleanely made: Her liuing is on two extremes relying, Shee's euer wetting, or shee's euer drying. As all men dye to liue, and liue to dye, So doth shee dry to wash, and wash to drye. Shee runnes like Luna in her circled spheare, As a perpetuall motion shee doth steare. Her course in compasse round and endlesse still, Much like a horse that labours in a mill: To shew more plaine how shee her worke doth frame, Our Linnen's foule e'r shee doth wash the same: From washing further in her course she marches, She wrings, she folds, she pleits, she smoothes, she starches, She stiffens, poakes, and sets and dryes againe, And foldes: thus end of paine begins her paine. Round like a whirligigge or lenten Top, Or a most plenteous spring, that still doth drop. The Suddes vnto the Sea I may compare, The Reake or smocke, the wind; the fishes Linnen are, The Laundresse fishes, foaming froth doth lighten, The whilest her tongue doth thunder &amp; affrighten, The totall is a tempest full of chiding, That no man in the house hath quiet byding. For Laundresses are testy and full of wroth, When they are lathering in their bumble broth, Nor can I blame them, though they brawle &amp; talke, Men there haue nought to doe, they may goe walke: Yet commonly their worke this profit brings, The good-wife washeth, and her husband wrings. But though my verse thus merrily doth stray, Yet giue the Laundresse still her due I pray: What were the painefull Spinner, or the Weauer, But for her labour, and her good endeauour, What were the function of the Linnen Draperye, Or Sempsters odmirable skill in Naperye? They all might turne and wind, and liue by losse, But that the Laundresse giues their worke a glosse, All Linnen that wee vse to weare, 'tis plaine, The Laundresse labour giues it grace and gaine, Without her 'tis most loathsome in distaste, And onely by her paines and toyle 'tis grac'd, Shee is the ornamentall Instrument, That makes it tastefull to the sight and scent: All you man-monsters, monstrous Linnen soylers, You shirt polluting tyrants, you sheets spoylers, Robustious rude Ruffe-rending raggamentoyes Terratritorian tragma Troynouantoyes Remember that your Laundresse paines is great, Whose labours onely keepe you sweet and neat: Consider this, that here is writ, or said, And pay her, (not as was the Sculler paid) Call not your Laundresse slut or slabb'ring queane, It is her slabb'ring that doth keepe thee cleane, Nor call her not Drye-washer in disgrace, For feare shee cast the suddes into thy face: By her thy Linnen's sweet and cleanely drest, Else thou wouldst stinke aboue ground like a beast. There is a bird which men Kings fisher call, Which in foule weather hath no ioy at all, Or scarce abroad into the ayre doth peepe, But in her melancholy nest doth keepe: Till Tytans glory from the burnish'd East, Rich Bridegroome-like in gold and purple drest, Guilds, and enamels mountaines, woods, and hilles, And the rotundious Globe with splendor filles, In these braue Buksome merry Halcion dayes, Then this most bewteous bird her plumes displaies. So doth a Laundresse, when the Sun doth hide His head, when skyes weepe raine and thunder chide, When powting, lowring, slauering sleete &amp; snow, From foggy Austers blustring iawes doth blow, Then shee in moody melancholy sittes, And sighing, vents her griefe by girds and fittes: Her liquid Linnen piteous pickl'd lyes, For which shee lowres and powts as doth the skies, But when bright Phœbus makes Aurora blush, And roabes the welkin with a purple flush, Wh? mourning cloudes haue wasted all their teares, And welcome weather faire and dry appeares, Then to the hedge amaine the Laundresse ambles, In weeds of pennance clothing bryers and brambles, Like a Commaundresse, vsing martiall Lawes, She strikes, she poakes and thrusts, she hangs and drawes, She stiffens stifly, she both opes and shuttes, She sets, and out she pulles, and in she puttes. Nor caring much if wind blow low or hye, Whilst drunkards thirst for drink, she thirsts to dry. Thus hauing shew'd the Laundresse praise and paine, How end or worke begins her worke againe: I hope amongst them they will all conclude, Not to requite me with ingratitude: But as an Act they'l friendly haue decreed, I ne'r shall want Cleane Linnen at my need. Whil'st to their owne contentments I comend them, And wish faire drying weather may attend them. If thankefully you take this worke of mine, Hereafter I will cause the muses nine, To helpe me adde, to what seemes here diminish'd, So Vale Tote, here my Booke is Finish'd. FINIS. VVit and Mirth: CHARGEABLY COLLECTED OVT OF TAVERNS, ORDINARIES, Innes, Bowling-Greenes and Allyes, Alehouses, Tobacco-shops, Highwayes, and Water-passages. Made vp, and fashioned into Clinches, Bulls, Quirkes, Yerkes, Quips, and Ierkes. Apothegmatically bundled vp and garbled at the request of old Iohn Garrets Ghost. DEDICATED To the truely Loyall harted, learned, well-accomplished Gentleman, Master Archibold Rankin. IOHN GARRETS GHOST. The doores and windowes of the Heauens were barr'd, And Nights blacke Curtaine, like an Ebon Robe, From Earth did all Celestiall light discard, And in sad darknesse clad the ample Globe; Dead midnight came, the Cats 'gan catterwaule, The time when Ghosts and Goblings walke about; Bats flye, Owles shrick, &amp; dismall Dogs doe bawle, Whiles conscience cleare securely sleeps it out. At such a time I sleeping in my bed, A vision strange appear'd vnto my sight, Amazement all my senses ouer spread, And fill'd me full with terrour and afright. A merry graue aspect me thought he had, And one he seem'd that I had often seene: Yet was he in such vncouth shape yclad, That what he was, I could not wistly weene. His cloake was Sack, but not the Sacke of Spaine, Canara, Mallago, or sprightfull Shery, But made of Sack-cloth, such as beares the graine, Good salt, &amp; coles, which makes the Porters weary; Lac'd round about with platted wheaten straw, For which he nothing to the Silke-man owed: A wearing neuer mention'd in the Law, And yet far off, like good gold lace it show'd. Lin'd was his mantle with good Essex plush, Pyde Calues skins, or Veale sattin, which you will: It neuer was worne threedbare with a brush, I (naturally) sau'd the labour still. A hat like Grantham steeple, for the crowne Or Piramide was large in altitude: With frugall brim, whereby he still was knowne From other men amongst a multitude. A Princes shooe, he for a iewell wore, Two ribbonds, and a feather in his beauer, Which shape me thought I oft had seene before, Yet out of knowledge where, as't had bin neuer. He in his hand a flaming torch did hold, (And as he neerer did approach to me) My hayre 'gan stand on end, feare struck me cold; Feare not, I am Iohn Garrets ghost, quoth he, I come to rowze thy dull and lazy Muse From idlenesse, from Lethe's hatefull lake: And therefore stand vpon no vaine excuse, But rise, and to thy tooles thy selfe betake. Remember me, although my carkasse rot, Write of me, to me, call me Foole or Iester. But yet I pray thee (Taylor) ranke me not, Among those knaues that doe the world bepester, Thou wrot'st of great O toole and Coriat, Of braue Sir Thomas Parsons, Knight o'th Sun, And Archy hath thy verse to glory at, And yet for me thou nought hast euer done. Write that in Ireland, I in Mars his crayne, Long time did vnder noble Norris serue: Where (as I could) I stood 'gainst Pope and Spaine, Whilst some were slain, &amp; some w?? want did starue Where shot, &amp; wounds, &amp; knocks, I gaue and tooke, Vntill at last halfe maimed as I was, A man decrepit, I those warres forsooke, And (with my Passe) did to my Country passe. Where getting health, I then shooke hands with death, And to the Court I often made resort. Where Englands mighty Queene Elizabeth Allow'd me entertainment for disport. Then by the foretop did I take old time: Then were not halfe to many fooles as now; Then was my haruest, and my onely prime, My purse receiuing what my wit did plow. Then in such compasse I my iests would hold, That though I gaue a man a gird or twaine, All his reuenge would be to giue me gold, With commendations of my nimble braine. Thus liu'd I till that gracious Queene deceast, Who was succeeded by a famous King: In whose blest Sons reigne (I with yeeres opprest) Me to my graue, sicknesse and death did bring. And now (kind Iacke) thou seest my ayrie forme, Hath shaken off her Iayle of flesh and bone, Whilest they remaine the feast of many a worme, My better part doth visit thee alone. And as betweene vs still, our good requests, Thou neuer me, I neuer thee deny'd: So for my sake collect some merry iests, Whereby sad time may be with mirth supply'd. And when 'tis written, find some good man forth, One (as thou think'st) was when I liu'd my friend: And though thy lines may be but little worth, Yet vnto him my duty recommend. So farewell Iacke, dame Luna 'gins to rise, The twinkling stars begin to borrow light: Remember this my suit, I thee aduise, And so once more good honest Iacke good night. With that more swifter then a shaft from bow, He cut and curried through the empty ayre, Whilest I amaz'd with feare, as could as snow, Straight felt my spirits quickly to repayre. And though I found it but a dreame indeed, Yet for his sake of whom I dreamed then, I left my bed, and cloath'd my selfe with speed, And presently betooke me to my pen: Cleere was the morne, and Phœbus lent me light, And (as it followeth) I began to write. WIT AND MIRTH.

But Reader, in my booke I hold it fit, To find you lines, your selfe must find you wit. (64) [Too much of one thing oft proues good for nothing] Too much of one thing oft proues good for nothing, And dainties in satiety, breed lothing: Th'ones flattery mingled with the others pride, Had seru'd them both, both might liue long vnspide (65) [Be it to all men by these presents knowne] Be it to all men by these presents knowne, Men need not kneele to giue away their owne: Ile stand vpon my feet when as I giue, And kneele when as I beg more meanes to liue: But some by this may vnderstand, That Courtiers oftner kneele then stand. (66) [One Spaniard mongst 6000, pitty t'were] One Spaniard mongst 6000, pitty t'were, Better ten thousand Britains bold were there, Led by braue Leaders, that might make Spain quake Like Vere, or Morgan, Essex, Blunt, or Drake.

(72) [The prodigall at Pouerty doth scoffe] The prodigall at Pouerty doth scoffe, Though from his backe the begger's not farre off. Here flour with flout, and bob with bo is quitted, And proud vain-glorious folly finely fitted.

(75) [Here's Bore and Brawne together are well met] Here's Bore and Brawne together are well met, He knew that giuing was no way to get. The world gets somewhat by the prodigall, When as the Mizer gets the diuell and all.

TO THE KINGS MOST Excellent Maiestie. The humble petition of Iohn Tailor, your Maiesties poore Water-Poet. Sheweth, Most mighty Monarch of this famous Ile, (Vpon the knees of my submissiue minde) I begge thou wilt be graciously inclin'd, To reade these lines my rusticke pen compile: Know (Royall Sir) Tom Coriate workes the wile, Your high displeasure on my head to bring; And well I wot, the sot, his words can file, In hope my fortunes head long downe to fling. The King, whose wisedome through the world did ring, Did heare the cause of two offending Harlots. So, I beseech thee (Great) great Britaines King, To doe the like for two contending Varlots. A brace of Knaues your Maiesty implores, To heare their suites as Salomon heard whores. FINIS. A DOGGE OF VVARRE, OR, The Trauels of Drunkard, the famous Curre of the Round Woollstaple in Westminster. His seruices in the Netherlands, and lately in FRANCE, with his home returne. To the Reader. Reader, if you expect from hence, For ouerplus of wit or Sence, I deale with no such Traffique: Heroicks and lambicks I, My Buskinde Muse hath laid them by, Pray bee content with Saphicke. Drunkard the Dog my Patron is, And hee doth loue mee well for this, Whose loue I take for Guerdon; And hee's a Dog of Mars, his Traine Who hath seene men and Horses slaine, The like was neuer heard on. A Dogge of Warre. Stand cleare, my masters 'ware your shins, For now to barke my Muse begins, 'Tis of a Dogge, I write now: Yet let mee tell you for excuse, That Muse or Dogge, or Dogge or Muse, Haue no intent to bite now. In doggrell Rimes my Lines are writ, As for a Dogge I thought it fit, And fitting best his Carkas. Had I beene silent as a Stoicke, Or had I writ in Verse Heroicke, Then had I beene a Starke Asse. Old Homer wrot of Frogges and Mice, And Rablaies wrot of Nittes and Lice, And Virgill of A Flye. One wrot the Treatise of the Foxe, Another praisd the Frenchmans Poxe, Whose praise was but a Lye. Great Alexander had a Horse, A famous Beast of mighty force Y cleap'd Bucephalus: Hee was a stout and sturdie Steed, And of an ex'lent Race and Breed, But that concernes not vs. I list not write the bable praise Of Apes, or Owles, or Popinjaies, Or of the Cat Grimmalkin But of a true and trusty Dogge, Who well could faune, but neuer cogge, His praise my Pen must walke in. And Drunkard hee is falsely nam'd, For which that Vice he ne'r was blam'd, For hee loues not god Baechus: The Kitchin he esteems morre deere, Then Cellers full of Wine or Beare, Which oftentimes doth wracke vs. Hee is no Mastiffe, huge of lim, Or Water-spaniell, that can swim, Nor bloud-hound or no Setter: No Bob-taile Tyke, or Trundle-taile, Nor can the Partridge spring or Quaile, But yet hee is much better. No Daintie Ladies fisting-Hound, That liue's vpon our Britaine Ground, Nor Mungrell Cur or Shog: Should Litters, or whole Kennells dare, With honest Drunkard to compare, My pen writes, marry fough. The Otter Hound, the Foxe Hound, nor The swift foote Grey-hound car'd hee for, Nor Cerberus Hells Bandogge; His seruice prooues them Curs and Tikes, And his renowne a terror strikes, In Water dogge and Land dogge. Gainst braue Buquoy, or stout Dampiere, Hee durst haue bark'd withouten feare, Or 'gainst the hot Count Tilly: At Bergen Laguer and Bredha, Against the Noble Spinola, He shewd himselfe not silly. He seru'd his Master at commands, In the most warlike Netherlands, In Holand, Zealand, Brabant, Hee to him still was true and iust, And if his fare were but a Crust, Hee patiently would knab on't. He durst t'haue stood sterne Aiax frowne, When wise Vlisses talk'd him downe In graue Diebus illis, When he by cunning prating won The Armour, from fierce Tellamon, That longed to Achilles: Braue Drunkard, oft on Gods deere ground, Tooke such poore lodging as he found, In Towne, Field, Campe or cottage His Bed but cold, his dyet thin, He oft in that poore case was in, To want both Meate and Pottage. Two rowes of Teeth for Armes, he bore, Which in his mouth hee alwaies wore, Which seru'd to fight and feed too: His grumbling for his Drum did passe, And barking (lowd) his Ordnance was, Which help'd in time of need too. His Taile his Ensigne hee did make, Which he would oft display, and shake, Fast in his Poope vpreared: His Powder hot, but somewhat danke, His Shot in (sent) most dangerous ranke, Which sometimes made him feared: Thus hath he long seru'd neere and farre, Well knowne to be A Dogge of Warre, Though hee ne'r shot with Musket; Yet Cannons roare, or Culuerings, That whizzing through the welkin sings, He slighted as a Pusse-Cat. For Guns, nor Drums, nor Trumpets clang, Nor hunger, cold, nor many a pang, Could make him leaue his Master: In ioy, and in aduersitie, In plentie, and in pouertie, Hee often was a Taster. Thus seru'd he on the Belgia Coast, Yet ne'r was heard to to brag or boast, Of seruices done by him: Hee is no Pharisey to blow A Trumpet, his good deedes to show, 'Tis pitty to belie him. At last hee home return'd in peace, Till warres, and iarres, and scarres increase Twixt vs, and France, in malice: Away went hee and crost the Sea, With's Master, to the Isle of Rhea, A good way beyond Callice. Hee was so true, so good, so kinde, He scornd to stay at home behinde, And leaue his Master frustrate; For which, could I like Ouid write, Or else like Virgill could endite, I would his praise illustrate. I wish my hands could neuer stirre, But I do loue a thankfull Curre, More then a Man ingratefull: And this poore dogges fidelity, May make a thanklesse Knaue discry, How much that vice is hatefull. For why, of all the faults of Men, Which they haue got from Hels blacke den, Ingratitude the worst is: For treasons, murthers, incests, rapes, Nor any sinne in any shapes, So bad, nor so accurst is. I hope I shall no anger gaine, If I doe write a word or twaine, How this dogge was distressed: His master being wounded dead, Shot, cut and slash'd, from heele to head, Thinke how he was oppressed, To lose him that he loued most, And be vpon a forreigne Coast, Where no man would relieue him: He lick'd his Masters wounds in loue, And from his Carkas would not moue, Although the sight did grieue him. By chance a Soudier passing by, That did his masters Coate espy, And quicke away he tooke it; But Drunkard followed to a Boate, To haue again his Masters Coate. Such theft hee could not brooke it. So after all his woe and wracke, To Westminster he was brought backe, A poore halfe starued Creature; And in remembrance of his cares, Vpon his backe hee closely weares, A Mourning Coate by nature. Liue Drunkard, sober Drunkard liue, I know thou no offence wlt giue, Thou art a harmles dumb thing; And for thy loue I'le freely grant, Rather then thou shouldst euer want, Each day to giue thee something. For thou hast got a good report, Of which ther's many a Dog comes short, And very few Men, gaine it; Though they all dangers brauely bide, And watch, fast, fight, runne, goe and rde, Yet hardly they attaine it. Some like Dominicall Letters goe, In Scarlet from the top to toe, Whose valours talke and smoake all. Who make (God sink'em) their discourse. Refuse, Renounce, or Dam, that's worse, I wish a halter choake all. Yet all their talke is Bastinado, Strong Armado Hot Scalado, Smoaking Trinidado. Of Canuasado, Pallizado Of the secret Ambuscado, Boasting with Brauado. If Swearing could but make a Man, Then each of these is one that can With oathes, an Army scatter: If Oathes could conquer Fort, or Hold, Then I presume these Gallants could With Braggs, a Castle batter. Let such but thinke on Drunkards fame, And note therewith their merits blame, How both are vniuersall; Then would such Coxcombs blush to see They by a dog outstrip'd should be, Whose praise is worth rehearsall. The times now full of danger are, And we are round ingadg'd in warre, Our foes would faine distresse vs: Yet may a stubborne mizer knaue, Will giue no Coyne his Throat to saue, If he were stor'd like Crœsus. These hide-bound Varlets, worse then Turkes, Top full with Faith, but no Good workes, A crew of fond Precise-men; In factions, and in emulation, Caterpillers of a Nation, Whom few esteeme. for wise men. But leauing such to mend, or end: Backe to the Dogge my Verse doth bend, Whose worth, the subiect mine is: Though thou a doggs life heere dost lead, Let not a doggs death strike thee dead: And make thy fatall Finis. Thou shalt be Stellifide by mee, I'le make the Dog-star waite on thee, And in his toome I'le seat thee: When Soll doth in his Progresse swinge, And in the Dogge-dayes hotly singe, Hee shall not ouer heate thee. So honest Drunkard now adue, Thy praise no longer I'le pursue, But still my loue is to thee: And when thy life is gon and spent, These Lines shall be thy Monument, And shall much seruice doe thee. I lou'd thy master, so did all That knew him, great and small, And he did well deserue it: For hee was honest, valiant, good, And one that manhood vnderstood, And did till death preserue it: For wose sake, I'le his Dog prefer, And at the Dogge at Westminster, Shall Drunkard be a Bencher; Where I will set a worke his chaps, Not with bare bones, or broken scraps, But Victualls from my Trencher. All those my Lines that Ill digest, Or madly doe my meaning wrest, In malice, or derision: Kinde Drunkard, prethee bite them all, And make them reele from wall to wall, With Wine, or Maults, incision. I know when foes did fight or parle, Thou valiantly wouldest grin and snarle, Against an Army aduerse; Which made me bold, with rusticke Pen, Stray heere and there, and backe agen, To blaze thy fame in mad Verse. It was no Auaritious scope, Or flattrie, or the windie hope Of any fee, or stipend: For none, nor yet for all of these, But only my poore selfe to please, This mighty Volume I Pen'd ANNO. This Series writ the day and yeare, That Seacoales were exceeding deare. FINIS. The VVorld runnes on vvheeles: OR, Oddes betwixt Carts and Coaches. The Diuell, the Flesh, the World doth Man oppose, And are his mighty and his mortall foes: The Diuell and the whorish Flesh drawes still, The World on wheeles runnes after with good will. For that which we the World may iustly call, (I meane the lower Globe Terrestriall) Is (as the Diuell, and a Whore doth please) Drawne here and there, and euerie where, with ease. Those that their Liues to vertue here doe frame, Are in the World, but yet not of the same. Some such there are, whom neither Flesh or Diuell Can wilfully drawe on to any euill: But for the World, as 'tis the World, you see, It Runnes on wheeles, and who the Palfreys be. Which Embleme to the Reader doth display, The Diuell and Flesh runne swift away. The Chain'd ensnared World doth follow fast, Till All into Perditions pit be cast. The Picture topsie-turuie stands kewwaw: The World turn'd vpside downe, as all men know FINIS. The Nipping or Snipping of ABVSES: OR, The Wooll-gathering of Wit. To the Castalian Water-writer, Splende &amp; dignoscar. A diall set vpon an eminent place, If clouds doe interuall Apolloes face, Is but a figur'd shape: whereby we knowe No article of Time, which it doth owe Vnto our expectations, yet wee see The tractes by which Times should distinguish'd be: In paralelled punctuall, ciphered lines, Which by a shadow, when the faire sunne shines, Explaines the houres: So if the Sonne of men Thy Glorious Patron, deeme to blesse thy pen With his faire light, Thy Muse so young, so faire, So well proportion'd, in conceites so rare: And Naturall streames, and stile, and eu'ry part, That Nature therein doth exceed all Art, Will then as with Enthusiasme inspir'd, Print Legends by the world to be admir'd. Thine Iames Ratray. To my friend by land and by water, Iohn Taylor. These leaues, kind Iohn, are not to wrap vp drams, That doe containe thy witty Epigrams, Let worser Poems serue for such abuse, Whilst thine shall be reseru'd for better vse. And let each Critick cauill what he can, Tis rarely written of a Water-man. Thy friend assured Rob: Branthwaite. To his deare friend Master Iohn Taylor. Me thinkes I see the Sculler in his boate, with goodly motion glide along faire Thames, And with a charming and bewitching noate, So sweet delightfull tunes and ditties frames: As greatest Lordings and the nicest Dames, That with attentiue eare did heare thy Layes, Of force should yeeld due merit to thy praise. Worth to all Watermen, straine forth thy voice, To proue so pleasing in the worlds proud eye, As eyes, and eares, and hearts may all reioyce, To see, heare, muse vpon the melodie, In contemplation of thy harmony, Let Thames faire bankes thy worth and praises ring, While I thy worth, and praise, beyond sea sing. Tho: Gent. To the Water-Poet, Iohn Taylor. Honest Iohn Taylor, though I know't no grace, To thee, or me, for writing in this place, Yet know I that the multitudes of friends Will thee protect, from vile malignant mindes: The rather cause what euer thou hast showne, Is no one mans inuention, but thine owne. Malicious minded men will thee dispraise; Enuy debases all, her selfe to raise. Then rest content, whilst to thy greater fame, Both Art, and Nature striue to raise thy name. Thine euer as thou knowest, R: Cudner. To my friend Iohn Taylor. If Homers verse (in Greeke) did merit praise, If Naso in the Latine won the Bayes, If Maro 'mongst the Romanes did excell, If Tasso in the Tuscan tongue wrote well, Then Taylor, I conclude that thou hast don In English, what immortall Baies haue won. Thy friend Iohn Tap. To my honest friend Iohn Taylor. Thy Taylors shears, foule vices wings haue clipt, The seames of impious dealings are vnript: So Art-like thou these captious times hast quipt, As if in Helicon thy pen were dipt, All those who' gainst thy worth are enuious lipt, Thy sharpe Satyrick Muse hath nipt and snipt: And to conclude, thy 'nuention is not chipt, Or stolne or borrowd, begd, or basely gript. Then Taylor, thy conceits are truely sowde, And, Sculler, (on my word) it was well rowde. Thine to my best power, Enoch Lynde. In Laudem Authoris. Most commonly one Taylor will dispraise Anothers workmanship, enuying alwaies At him thats better then himselfe reputed, Though he himselfe be but a botcher bruted: So might it well be said of me (my friend) Should I not to thy worke some few lines lend, Which to make probable, this sentence tendeth, Who not commends, he surely discommendeth: In my illiterate censure, these thy rimes, Deserue applause, euen in these worst of times: VVhen wit is onely worthy held in those, On whom smooth flattery vaine praise bestowes; But I not minding with thy worth to flatter, Do know thy wit too good to toyle by water. Rob. Taylor. To my friend Iohn Taylor. This worke of thine, thou hast compil'd so well, It merits better wits thy worth to tell. Thine Maximilian Waad. The Authours description of a Poet and Poesie, with an Apology in defence of Naturall English Poetry. Shall beggers diue into the Acts of Kings? Shall Nature speake of supernat'rall things, Shall Eagles flights attempted be by Gnats? Shall mighty Whales be portraied out by Sprats? These things I know vnpossible to be, And it is as vnpossible for mee, That am a begger in these Kingly acts, Which from the heau'ns true Poetrie extracts. A supernat'rall foole by Nature I That neuer knew this high-borne mystery, A worthlesse gnat, I know my selfe more weake, Yet of the Princely Eagle dare to speake: A silly sprat the Ocean seekes to sound, To seek this Whale, though seeking he be drown'd: Then to proceed: a Poets Art, I know, Is not compact of earthly things below: Nor is of any base substantiall mettle, That in the worlds rotundity doth settle: But tis immortall, and it hath proceeding, From wh?ce diuinest soules haue all their breeding. It is a blessing heau'n hath sent to men, By men it is diuulged with their pen: And by that propagation it is knowne, And ouer all the world disperst and throwne: In verball elocution so refinde, That it to Vertue animates mans minde: The blessed Singer of blest Israel, In this rare Arte, he rarely did excell, He sweetly Poetiz'd in heau'nly verses, Such lines which aye eternity rehearses: What Reuerend rare, and glorious great esteeme Augustus Cæsar did a Poet deeme. Admired Virgils life doth plainely show, That all the world a Poets worth may know: But leauing Israels King, and Romane Cæsar, Let's seeke in England English Poets treasure, Sir Philip Sidney, his times Mars and Muse, That word and sword, so worthily could vse, That spight of death, his glory liu's, alwaies For Conquests, and for Poesie crown'd with bayes: What famous men liue in this age of ours, As if the Sisters nine had left their bowres, With more post haste then expeditious wings They heere haue found the Heliconian springs. We of our mighty Monarch Iames may boast, Who in this heau'nly Arte exceeds the most: Where men may see the Muses wisdome well: When such a glorious house they chose to dwell. The Preacher whose instructions, doe afford The soules deare food, the euerliuing Word: If Poets skill be banisht from his braine, His preaching (sometimes) will be but too plaine: Twixt Poetry and best diuinity There is such neere and deare affinity, As 'twere propinquity of brothers blood, That without tone, the other's not so good: The man that takes in hand braue verse to write, And in Diuinitie hath no insight, He may perhaps make smooth, and Art-like Rimes, To please the humours of these idle times: But name of Poet hee shall neuer merit, Though writing them, he waste his very spirit: They therefore much mistake that seeme to say, How euery one that writes a paltrie play: A sottish Sonnet in the praise of loue, A song or jigge, that fooles to laughter moue, In praise or dispraise, in defame or fame, Deserues the honour of a Poets name: I further say, and further will maintaine, That he that hath true Poesie in his braine, Will not profane so high and heau'nly skill, To glory or be proud of writing ill: But if his Muse doe stoope to such deiection, Tis but to shew the world her sinnes infection: A Poets ire sometimes may be inflam'd: To make foule Vices brazen face asham'd. And then his Epigrams and Satyres whip, Will make base gald vnruly Iades to skip: In frost they say 'tis good, bad blood be nipt, And I haue seene Abuses whipt and stript In such rare fashion, that the wincing age, Hath kick'd and flung, with vncontrouled rage. Oh worthy Withers, I shall loue thee euer, And often maist thou doe thy best indeuer, That still thy workes and thee may liue together, Contending with thy name and neuer wither. But further to proceed in my pretence Of natr'all English Poetries defence: For Lawreat Sidney, and our gracious Iames, Haue plunged been in Arts admired streames: And all the learned Poets of our dayes, Haue Arts great ayde to winne still liuing Bayes: All whom I doe confesse such worthy men, That I vnworthy am with inke and pen To carry after them But since my haps Haue been so happy as to get some scraps, By Nature giu'n me from the Muses table, I'le put them to the best vse I am able: I haue read Tasso, Virgill, Homer, Ouid, Iosephus, Plutark, whence I haue approued, And found such obseruations as are fit, With plenitude to fraught a barren wit. And let a man of any nation be, These Authors reading, makes his iudgement see Some rules that may his ignorance refine, And such predominance it hath with mine. No bladder-blowne ambition puff's my Muse, An English Poets writings to excuse: Nor that I any rule of art condem, Which is Dame Natures ornamentall Iem: But these poore lines I wrote (my wits best pelfe) Defending that which can defend it selfe. Know then vnnat'ral English Mungril Monster, Thy wandring iudgem?t doth too much misconster: When thou affirm'st thy Natiue Country-man, To make true verse no art or knowledge can: Cease, cease to do this glorious Kingdome wrong, To make her speech inferiour to each tongue: Shew not thy selfe more brutish then a beast, Base is that bird that files her homeborne neast. In what strange tongue did Virgils Muse commerce? What language wast that Ouid wrote his verse? Thou sayst 't was Latin: why I say so too, In no tongue else they any thing could doo: They Naturally did learne it from their mother, And must speake Latin, that could speake no other: The Grecian blinded Bard did much compile, And neuer vsde no foreigne far-fetcht stile: But as hee was a Greeke, his verse was Greeke, In other tongues (alas) he was to seeke. Du Bartas heauenly all admired Muse, No vnknowne Language euer vs'de to vse: But as he was a Frenchman, so his lines In natiue French with fame most glorious shines, And in the English tongue tis fitly stated, By siluer-tongued Siluester translated. So well, so wisely, and so rarely done, That he by it immortall fame hath wonne. Then as great Maro, and renowned Naso, Braue Homer, Petrarke, sweet Italian Tasso: And numbers more, past numbring to be numberd, Whose rare inuentions neuer were incumberd, With our outlandish chip chop gibrish gabbling: To fill mens cares with vnacquainted babbling: Why may not then an English man, I pray; In his owne language write as erst did they? Yet must we suit our phrases to their shapes, And in their imitations be their Apes. Whilst Muses haunt the fruitfull forked hill, The world shall reuerence their vnmatched skill. And for inuention, fiction, methood, measure, From them must Poets seeke to seeke that treasure. But yet I think a man may vse that tongue His Country vses, and doe them no wrong. Then I whose Artlesse studies are but weake, Who neuer could, nor will but English speake, Do heere maintaine, if words be rightly plac'd, A Poets skill, with no tongue more is grac'd. It runnes so smooth, so sweetly it doth flow, From it such heauenly harmony doth grow, That it the vnderstanders sences moues With admiration, to expresse their loues. No musicke vnder heauen is more diuine, Then is a well-writ, and a well-read line. But when a witlesse selfe-conceited Rooke, A good inuention dares to ouerlooke: How pitteous then mans best of wit is martyr'd, In barbrous manner totter'd, torne and quarter'd, So mingle mangled, and so hack't and hewd, So scuruily beseuruide and bemewde? Then this detracting durty dunghill Drudge, Although he vnderstand not, yet will iudge. Thus famous Poesie must abide the doome Of euery muddy-minded raskall Groome. Thus rarest Artists are continuall stung By euery prating, stinking lumpe of dung. For what cause then should I so much repine, When best of writers that ere wrote a line, Are subiect to the censure of the worst, Who will their follies vent, or else they burst? I haue at idle times some Pamphlets writ, (The fruitlesse issue of a nat'rall wit) And cause I am no Scholler, some enuy me, With foule and false calumnious words belie me: With brazen fronts, and flinty hard beleefe, Affirming or suspecting me a theefe: And that my sterrile Muse so dry is milch'd, That what I write, is borrow'd, beg'd, or filch'd. Because my name is Taylor, they suppose My best inuentions all from stealing growes: As though there were no difference to be made Betwixt the name of Taylor, and the Trade. Of all strange weapons, I haue least of skill To mannage or to wield a Taylors bill. I cannot Item it for silke and facing, For cutting, edging, stiffning, and for lacing: For bumbast, stitching, binding and for buckram, For cotton, bayes, for canuas and for lockram. All these I know, but know not how to vse them, Let trading Taylors therefore still abuse them, My skil's as good to write, to sweate, or row, As any Taylors is to stea e or sow. In end my pulsiue braine no Art affoords, To mint or stamp, or forge new coyned words. But all my tongue can speake or pen can write, VVas spoke and writ, before I could indite, Yet let me be of my best hopes bereft, If what I euer writ, I got by theft: Or by base symony, or bribes, or gifts, Or beg'd, or borrowd it by sharking shifts, I know, I neuer any thing haue done, But what may from a weake inuention runne. Giue me the man whose wit will vndertake A substance of a shaddow for to make: Of nothing something, (with Arts greatest aide) With Nature onely all his Muse arraide, That solid matter from his braine can squeez, Whilst some lame Artists wits are drawn to'th leez. By teaching Parrots prate and prattle can, And taught an Ape will imitate a man: And Banks his hors shew'd tricks, taught with much labor, So did the hare that plaid vpon the tabor. Shall man, I pray, so witlesse be besotted? Shall men (like beasts) no wisdome be allotted? (Without great studie) with instinct of Nature, Why then were man the worst and basest creature? But men are made the other creatures Kings, Because superiour wisdome from them springs: And therefore Momus, vnto thee againe, That dost suspect, the issues of my braine, Are but my bastards, now my Muse doth flie, And in thy throat giues thy suspect the lie. And to the triall dares thee when thou dar'st, Accounting thee a coward, if thou spar'st. I haue a little wit, and braine, and spleene, And gall and memorie, and mirth and teene, And passions, and affections of the minde, As other Mortals vse to be enclinde. And hauing all this, wherefore should men doubt, My wit should be so crippled with the Gowt, That it must haue assistance to compile, Like a lame dog, that's limping or a stile? No, no, thou Zoylus, thou detracting else, Though thou art insufficient in thy selfe, And hast thy wit and studies in reuersion, Cast not on me that scandalous aspersion. I hate such ballad-mongring riming slaues, Such iygging rascals, such audacious knaues, The bane of learning, the abuse of Arts, The scumme of Natures worst defectiue parts: The scorne of schollers, poison of rewards, Regardlesse vassalls of true worths regards, The shame of time, the canker of deserts, The dearth of liberall and heroicke hearts, That like so many bandogs snarle and snatch, And all's their owne they can from others catch: That licke the scraps of Schollers wits (like dogs) (A Prouerbe old) draffs good enough for hogs. Purloyning line by line, and peece by peece, And from each place they read, will filch a fleece. Me thinks my Muse should piecemeale teare these rogues More base &amp; vile th? tatter'd Irish brogues. Clawkissing raskals, flattering parasites, Sworne vices vassalls, vertues opposites. Tis you dambde curs haue murderd liberall minds, And made best Poets worse esteem'd then hindes: But wherefore doe I take a Schollers part, That haue no ground or Axioms of Art, That am in Poesie an artlesse creature, That haue no learning but the booke of Nature; No Academicall Poeticke straines, But home-spun medley of my mottley braines? The reason a Schollers wants bewaile, And why against base litter'd whelps I raile, Is this, that they long time should time bestow, In painefull study, secret Arts to know, And after liue in want, contempt and scorne, By euery dung-hill peasant ouer-borne, Abus'd, reiected, doggedly disgrac'd, Despised, ragged, lowzie, and out-fac'd, Whilst Bag-pipe-poets stuft with others wind, Are grac'd for wit, they haue from them purloind. Now in my owne defence once more I'l say, Their too rash iudgements too much runne astray, That, 'cause my name is Taylor, I doe theeue it, I hope their wisdomes will no more beleeue it: Nor let my want of learning be the cause, I should be bitten with blacke enuies iawes: For whose'r by nature is not a Poet, By rules of Art he neuer well can show it. Ther's many a wealthy heire long time at Schoole, Doth spend much study, and comes home a foole. A Poet needs must be a Poet borne, Or else his Art procures his greater scorne, For why? if Art alone made men excell, Me thinks Tom Coriat should write ex'lent well: But he was borne belike in some crosse yeere, When learning was good cheap, but wit was deare. Then to conclude, as I before began, Though nought by Schollership or Art I can, Yet (if my stocke by nature were more bare) I scorne to vtter stolne or borrowed ware: And therefore Reader, now I tell thee plaine, If thou incredulous dost still remaine; If yea or nay these reasons doe perswade thee, I leaue thee and thy faith to him that made thee. To the Kings most excellent Maiesty. Anagramma. Iames Stuart. Mvses Tari at. Great Soueraigne, as thy sacred Royall brest Is by the Muses whole and sole possest: So do I know, Rich, Precious, Peerelesse Iem, In writing vnto Thee, I write to them.

These back-ward and these forward lines I send, To your right Royall high Maiesticke hand: And like the guilty prisoner I attend Your consure, wherein blisse or bale doth stand.

Loues labyrinth, with the description of the seuen Planets. I trauel'd through a wildernesse of late, Ashady, darke, vnhaunted desart groue: Wheras a wretch explain'd his piteous state, Whose mones the Tygers vnto ruthe would moue: Yet though he was a man cast downe by Fate, Full manly with his miseries hee stroue: And dar'd false Fortune to her vtmost worst, And e'r he meant to bend, would brauely burst. Yet swelling griefe so much o'r-charg'd his heart, In scalding sighes, he needs must vent his woe, Where groans, and teares, and sighes, all beare a part, As partners in their masters ouerthrow: Yet spight of griefe, he laught to scorne his smart, And midst his depth of care demean'd him so, As if sweet concord bore the greatest sway, And snarling discord was inforc'd t'obey. Thou Saint (quoth he) I whilome did adore, Thinke not thy youthfull feature still can last, In winters age, thou shalt in vaine implore, That thou on me, such coy disdaine didst cast: Then, then remember old said sawes of yore. Time was, Time is, but then thy Time is past: And in the end, thy bitter torments be: Because that causelesse, thou tormentedst me Oh you immortall, high Imperious pow'rs, Haue you in your resistlesse doomes decreed, To blast with spight, &amp; scorne my pleasant houres, To starue my hopes, and my despaire to feed? Once more let me attaine those sunshine showres: Whereby my withered ioyes againe may breed. If gods no comfort to my cares apply, My comfort is, I know the way to dye. 1 To Saturne. With wits distracted here I make my will, I doe bequeath to Saturne, all my sadnesse, When Melancholy first my heart did fill, My sences turne from sobernesse to madnesse: Since Saturne, thou wast Authour of my ill, To giue me griefe, and take away my gladnesse: Malignant Planet, what thou gau'st to me, I giue againe, as good a gift to thee. 2 To Ioue. I doe surrender backe to thundring Ioue, All state, which erst my glory did adorne: My frothy pomp, and my ambitious loue, To thee, false Iupiter, I backe returne All Iouiall thoughts, that first my heart did moue, In thy Maiesticke braine was bred and borne: Which by thy inspiration caus'd my wracke, And therefore vnto thee, I giue it backe. 3 To Mars. To Mars I giue my rough robustious rage, My anger, fury, and my scarlet wrath: Man-slaughtring murder, is thy onely page, Which to thy bloudy guidance I bequeath, Thy seruants all, from death should haue their wage, For they are executioners for death: Great Mars, all fury, wrath, and rage of mine, I freely offer to thy Goary shrine. 4 To Sol. All-seeing Sol, thy bright reflecting eye Did first with Poets Arte inspire my braines: Tis thou that me so much didst dignifie, To wrap my soule with sweet Poetike straines, And vnto thee, againe before I dye, I giue againe, a Poets gainelesse gaines, Though wit and arte are blessings most diuine, Yet here, their iems, amongst a heard of swine. 5 To Venus. To thee, false Goddesse, loues adultrous Queene, My most inconstant thoughts I doe surrender: For thou alone, alone hast euer beene True louers bane, yet seemest loues defender, And were thy Bastard blinde, as fooles doe weene, So right he had not spilt my heart so tender: Fond Vulcans pride, thou turn'st my ioy to paine, Which vnto thee, I render backe againe. 6 To Mercury. To Mercury, I giue my sharking shifts, My two-fold false equiuocating tricks: All cunning sleights, and close deceiuing drifts, Which to deceitfull wrong my humour pricks: All my Buzeaka's, my Decoyes and Lifts: No birdlime henceforth to my fingers sticks. My thoughts, my words, my actions that are bad, To thee I giue, for them from thee I had. 7 To Luna. And last and low'st of all these Planets seuen, My wau'ring thoughts, I giue to Lunae's guiding: My senslesse braines, of wit and sence bereauen, My stedfast change, and my most certaine sliding, All various alterations vnder heauen, All that is mine, ore mouing or abyding, My woes, my ioyes, my mourning and my mirth, I giue to thee, from whence they had their birth. Thus he against the higher powers contends, And threats, and bans, and beats his care crazd brest, The birds harmonious musicke to him lends, Which addes no rest vnto his restlesse rest: Yea eu'ry thing in louing sort attends: Al senceable, and sencelesse doe their best. With helplesse helps do helpe to mone his mone, And her he loues, remaines vnkinde alone. At last he rose from out the place he lay, And frantickly ran woodly through the wood: The scratching brambes in the wailesse way, Intreate his stay, but in a hare-braind mood, He fled, till weary he at last did stay, To rest him, where a ragged rocke there stood With resolution to despaire and dye, Whil'st Eccho to his mone did thus reply. Eccho. May humane mischiefes be compar'd with mine? Eccho. mine. Thine, babbling Eccho, would thy tongue told true: Eccho. true. I rue, that I alone must weepe and pine: Eccho. pine. I pine for her, from whom my cares ensue, Eccho. sue. I sue, I serue a marble-hearted faire, Eccho. ayre. And ayre is all the fruit of fruitlesse loue: Eccho. loue. Lou's hope is past, then welcom black despaire Eccho. despair. Shall there despaire my causeles curse remoue? Eccho. moue. Oh whither shall I moue, to ioy or paine? Eccho. paine. Must paine be my reward for paine for aye? Eccho. aye. Aye must my torment feed her scornfull vain? Eccho. vaine. To ease me griefe, wil she say yea or nay? Eccho. nay. Nay, then from loue and all his lawes I fly. Eccho. fly. I fly, I search, I seeke the way to die. Eccho. die. Thus brabbling 'gainst all things he heares or sees, Impatient at his froward fortunes wrongs: No sensu'all obiect with his sence agrees. All pleasures his dispeasure more prolongs: At length he carues vpon the thick-bark'd trees These vnder written sad lamenting songs. And as my weake inuention vnderstood, His farewell thus, was grau'd vpon the wood. Sonnet. Like a decrepit wretch, deform'd and lame My verse approaches to my dearest Dame Whose dire disdaine, makes my laments her game Whose scornfull eies adde fuell to my flame. But whether shee, or I, are most too blame I for attempting to exalt her fame With fruitlesse Sonnets; which my wit did frame: Or shee whose piercing lookes my heart o'r-came. Her feature can both men and monsters tame The gods, and fiends adore and dread her name Whose matchlesse forme doth Citherea shame, Whose cruell heart remaineth still the same And in a word, I striue against the streame My state's too low, and hers is too supreme. Then since so scornefull is her high disdaine, Since all my loue is but bestow'd in vaine Curbe fancie then, with true discretions Reine, Let reason cure my tor-tormenting paine, Suppose I should at last, my suit attaine, And then sit downe and count my losing gaine: My haruest would be tares in stead of graine. Then Ile no longer vexe my vexed braine To seeke her loue, who ioyes when I complaine No longer I, loues vassall will remaine, I'l be no more of Cupids witlesse traine, Whose partiall blindenesse hath so many slaine. Proud Dame, whose brest my loue didst earst refrain Despight loues lawes, I'le be no more thy swaine. Thus like a man, whose wits were quite bereft him, I found him mad with loue, and so I left him. Plutoes Proclamation concerning his Infernall pleasure for the Propagation of Tobacco. True Newes &amp; strange my Muse intends to write, From horrid concaues of eternall night: Whereas a damned Parlament of Deuils, Enacted lawes to fill the world with euils. Blacke Pluto sundry proclamations sends Through Barathrum, and summons all the fiends, To know how they on earth had spent their times, And how they had beclog'd the world with crimes. First spake an ancient Deuill ycleaped Pride, Who said he wandred had, both farre and wide, Dispersing his Ambitious poisnous bane, As farre as Luna doth both waxe or wane. Next summond was a rake-hell furgownd curre, Cal'd Auarice, (whose rotten haulking murre) Was like to choake him, ere he could declare How hee had soules possest with monies care. That so they fill their Coffers to the brim, All's one, let sweet saluation sinke or swimme. The third that to the Parlament came in, Was murder, all inroab'd in scarlet sinne, Who told great Limboes monarch he had done Such deeds, as thousand soules to hell haue wonne. The fourth that entred to this damned Iurie, Was sweet sinne Lechery, a smugfac'd furie: Said that the world should his great pains approue, Where vniuersall lust is counted loue. The fift was an ilshaped decrepit Crone Cald Enuy, all consum'd to skinne and bone: And shee declar'd what labour he had spent To Honours, and to Vertues detriment. Then sixt, did Burst-gut Gluttony appeere, Whose sole delight is all in belly-cheere: Who told how he mens greedy mindes did serue To cram their bodies, whilst their soules did sterue. The seuenth was Sloth, an vgly lothsome wretch, Who being cald, did gape, and yawne, and stretch: I haue (quoth he) done as your highnesse wil'd, I all the world with Idlenesse haue fil'd, In lazie Creatures members I doe lurke, That thousands will be hang'd, before the'ile work. Then Pluto said, These ills, you haue done well, In propagation of our Kingdome, Hell: But yet ther's one thing which I will effect, Which too long hath been buried with neglect; And this it is, in Rich America, In India, and black Barbaria. Whereas the peoples superstitions show Their minde, because no other God they know, In those misguided lands I caus'd to breed A foule contagious, stinking Manbane weede: Which they (poore fooles) with diligence do gather To sacrifice to me that am their Father: Where euery one a Furies shape assumes, Befog'd and clouded with my hel-hatch'd fumes. But these blacke Nations that adore my name, I'le leaue in pleasure: and my mischiefes frame Gainst those who by the name of Christian goe, Whose Author was my finall ouerthrowe. And therefore straight diuulge our great commands, That presently throughout all Christian lands, Tobacco be disperst, that they may be As Moores and Pagans are, all like to me: That from the Palace to the paltry nooke, Like hell in imitation all may looke. In vice let Christians passe both Iewes and Turkes, And let them outpasse Christians in good workes. Let euery Cobler with his dirty fist, Take pride to be a blacke Tobacconist. Let Idiot Coxcombs sweare, 'tis excellent geare, And with a whiffe their reputations reare. Let euery idle addle-pated gull With stinking sweet Tobacco stuffe his skull. Let Don Fantasticke smoake his vasty gorge, Let rich and poore, let honest men and knaues, Be smoak'd and stunke vnto their timelesse graues. Thus is our last irreuocable will, Which though it dam not man, I know twill kill: And therefore strait to euery Christian Nation, Diuulge and publish this our Proclamation. Giuen at our Palace at Gehenna, &amp;c. This Proclamation was no sooner doon, But thousand furies to and fro did runne, T' accomplish what their Master Pluto spoke, And fully fill the world with stinke and smoake: And now the man that's e'ne of feeling reft, By reason of his age, whose teeth haue left The vasty Cauerne of his mumping cud, Must haue Tobacco to reuiue his blood: The glistring Gallant, or the Gallant Gull, The icering Pander, and the hackney Trull, The Roysting Rascall, and the swearing Slaue, The Hostler, Tapster, all in generall craue To be a foggy, misty, smoaky Iury Vpon this vpstart newfound Indian fury. Great Captaine Gracelesse stormes, protests, and sweares, He'le haue the rascall Poet by the eares, And beate him, as a man would beate a dog, That dares once speake against this precious fogge. It is the iewel that hee most respects, It is the gemme of ioy his heart affects: It is the thing his soule doth most adore, To liue and loue Tobacco, and a whore: Hee'le cram his braines with fumes of Indian grasse, And grow as fat with't as an English Asse. Some say Tobacco will mens daies prolong. To whom I answer, they are in the wrong. And sure my conscience giues me not the lie, I thinke 'twill make men rotten ere they die. Old Adam liu'd nine hundred thirty yeere, Yet ne'r dranke none, as I could read or heare And some men now liue ninety yeeres and past, Who neuer dranke Tobacco first nor last. Then since at first it came from faithlesse Moores, (And since tis now more common far then whores) I see no reason any Christian Nation Should follow them in diuellish imitation: So farewell pipe, and pudding, snuffe and smoake, My Muse thinks fit to leaue, before she choake. To the Right Honourable, Lord, William Earle of Pembroke, William Herbert. Anagramma. My heart will beare. Right Noble Lord, whose brest doth beare a heart Which is a Patron vnto Armes and Art: In spight of Enuy, still thy fame shines cleere: For none but honor'd thoughts thy heart wil beare. VVhen I but think, the daies we wander in, How most part of the world do liue by sin: How finely Satan shewes his cunning skill, That one man gets his goods, from others ill, Doe not the Lawyers liue like mighty Lords, On brawles, on iarrres, contentions and discords, When if men (as they should) would but agree, A Tearme would scarcely yeeld a Lawyers fee? Let vsurers bragge of conscience what they can, They liue like deuils, vpon the bane of man: The racking Land-lord gets his ill got store, By raysing rents, which make his tenants poore: Clap-shoulder Serieants get the deuill and all, By begg'ring and by bringing men in thrall. Like Gentlemen, the Iaylors spend their liues By keeping men in fetters, bonds and gyues: The vintner and the vict'lar get most gaines From dayly drunkards, and distemperd braines: From whence do Iustice Clerks get most they haue, But from the whore, the thiefe, the bawd, the knaue? In what consists the hangmans greatest hope, But hope of great imployment for the rope? The very blue-coate Beadles get their trash, By whips and rods, and the fine firking lash. But leauing these, note but how Corporations From others vices, get their reputations: The vpstart veluet silken satten gull, His owne purse empts, to fill the Mercers full: When for his birth, or wit more fit agrees, A breech of leather, and a coate of freese. The Taylor is a Gentleman transform'd For his inuenting fashions new deform'd, And those that make the Verdingales and bodies, Get most they haue, from idle witlesse nodies. The Tires, the Periwigs, and the Rebatoes, Are made t'adorne ilshap'd Inamoratoes. Yea all the world is falne to such a madnesse, That each man gets his goods from others badnesse. The Chirurgian and Phisicion get their stockes, From Gowts, from Feauers, Botches, Piles, &amp; Pocks: With others paine, they most of all are pleas'd, And best are eas'd, when others are diseas'd. As Sextons liue by dead, and not by quicke, So they liue with the sound, but by the sicke. Thus each man liues by other mens amisse, And one mans meat, anothers poyson is. To the Right honourable John Lord Viscount Haddington, Earle of Holdernes, Iohn Ramsey. Anagramma I ayme Honors. Thrice worthy Lord, whose vertues do proclaime, How Honors noble marke is still thy Ayme, T'attaine the which, thou holdst thy hand so steady, That thy deserts haue wonne the prize already. To the Honourable Knight Sir Thomas Bludder. Anagramma Arm'd, Thus bold. God is my Captaine, my defence and hold, Through faith in him, I am thus arm'd, thus bold. Upon the Powder-Treason the fifth of Nouember 1605. This day old Dæmon, and the damned Crue, Our King and Kingdome in the ayre had tost: But that our God their diuellish practice crost, And on their treacherous heads the mischiefe threw: No Pagan, Tartar, Turke or faithlesse Iew, Or hels blacke Monarch with his hatefull host, Since first amongst them Treason was ingrost, No plot like that from their inuention flew. But when they thought a powder blast, a breath Should all this Iland into totters teare: Th' Almighties mercy freed vs from that feare, And paid the Traitors with infamous death. For which, let King, and all true Subiects sing Continuall praise vnto Heau'ns gracious King. To the Right Honourable Iohn Moray, Lord Viscount Annan, Earle of Annandale, Gentleman of his Maiesties Honourable Bed-chamber. Anagramma I ayme Honour. Industrious Loyalty doth dayly tell, You Ayme at honour, and you leuell well, And with your trusty seruice shoot so right, That in the end you sure will hit the white. Twelue Sonnets vpon the Sonnes entring into the twelue Cœlestiall Signes. [Diurnall Titans all reuiuing Carre] The 10. of March, the Sunne enters into Aries, or the signe of the Ram. March 10. Aries. Diurnall Titans all reuiuing Carre, Through all the heauens his progresse now he takes: And now his glistering Raies he doth vnbarre: And what his absence mard, his presence makes: Now he begins dame Tellus face to parch, With blustring Boreas &amp; with Eurus breth, Thicke clouds of dust in March, through ayre doth march, And Plants dead seeming Re-reuiues from death. Now at the heauy-headed horned Ram, Æolus, Æthon, Phlegon, and Pyrois, On sweet Ambrosya sweetly feede and cram, And drinking Nectars gods carowsing iuice, Thus yeerely, one and thirty daies at least, In Aries Titan daines to be a guest. To the Right Honourable Christopher Villers, Earle of Anglesey. Anagramma, Christ is our helper. To me and mine, our onely comfort's this, In all good Actions, Christ our helper is. [Hiperion now's remou'd vnto the Bull] The 11. of Aprill he comes into Taurus, or the Signe of the Bull. Taurus. Hiperion now's remou'd vnto the Bull, And seemes all hid in Mists and watry bowres: Till wollsacke seeming cloudes are bursting full, And then he glides the Aire with golden showres. He shines, he hides, he smiles, and then he lowres, Now glorious glowing, and straight darkned dim: He's now obscur'd, and now his beames out powres, As skies are cleare, or thicke twixt vs and him. Thus all the Aprill, at bo-peepe he plaies, Incircling daily the Rotundious spheare. And at the Bull he hides his glistring raies, Till ayre is purgde of cloudes, and skies are cleare. Then he the head-strong Taurus soone forsakes, And to his Summer progresse haste he makes. To the Right Honorable the Earle of Manchester, Lord priuy Seale to the Kings Maiestie, Henry Montagve. Anagramma Gouerneth many. Amongst a Million, there is hardly Any, That (like your selfe) so well doth gouerne Many. [Now bright fac'd Sminthus, with faire Flora meets] The 12. of May the Sunne enters into Gemini, or the Twinnes. Gemini, May. Now bright fac'd Sminthus, with faire Flora meets, Adorning her with Natures best attire: Trees, plants, hearbs, flowres, &amp; odoriferous sweets, With Birds all chaunting in their feathered quire. Now countrie Tom and Tyb haue their desire, And rowle and tumble freely on the grasse, The Milke-maide gets a greene gowne for her hire, And all in sport the time away doe passe, The bird, the beast, the lusty lad, the lasse: Doe sing, doe friske, doe clip, doe coll, doe kisse, Not thinking how the time must be, or was, But making pleasant vse of time as tis, Till Sminthus leaues his lodging at the twinnes, And to a hotter race his course beginnes. To my approued good friend, M? Robert Branthwayte. Anagramma. You beare a heart true bent. Let fortune smile, or frowne, you are content, At all Assaies you beare a heart true bent. [Of all the Innes where Sol doth vse to lie] The 12. of Iune the Sunne enters into Cancer or the Crabbe. Cancer. Iune. Of all the Innes where Sol doth vse to lie, With crabbed Cancer none may make c?pare: It is the highest in the loftie skie, All other signes to it inferiour are. When Sol is once ascended and come there: He scalds and scorches with his heauenly heate: Makes fields of grasse, and flowrie medowes bare, And though the idle worke not, yet they sweate, Thus like an all-commanding Lord he swaies, High mounted in his chiefe Solstician pride: For when the Cancer hee immures his raies, Vnto the height his glorie's amplifide. And when he goes from thence, he doth beginne By shorter Iourneyes to attaine his Inne. [The worlds eye daz'ler in his fiery race] The thirteenth of Iuly the Sunne enters into Leo, or the Lion. Leo. Iuly. The worlds eye daz'ler in his fiery race, Doth at the Lyon lodge his vntam'd Steeds: And now the ripening yeere begins apace To shew Dame Tellus, procreatiue seeds. For as from man, mans generation breeds, So by manuring of our Grandam Earth, Are brought forth fruits, &amp; flowres, and hearbs, and weeds, To shield ingratefull man from pining dearth. The dogged dog daies now with heat doe swelt, And now's the season, of th'vnseasn'd aire: When burning feauers make the patient melt, Whose heat the Doctors hardly can repaire: For why, these currish daies are fatall still, And where they chance to bite, they vse to kill. [Vnhappy Phaetons Splendidious Sire] The foureteenth of August, the Sunne enters into Virgo, Or the Virgin. Virgo. August. Vnhappy Phaetons Splendidious Sire, Left amorous bussing beauteous Climens lips, And all inspir'd with Loues cœlestiall fire: His Globe surrounding Steed amaine he whips: And to the Virgin Virgo downe doth glide, Where for she entertain'd him to his pleasure, He his exchequer coffers opens wide, And fils the world with haruests wisht for treasure, Now country Hindes vnto their tooles betake. The forke, the rake, the sithe, the hooke, the cart, And all a generall expedition make, Till Nature be left naked by their art. At last the Virgin, when these things are don, Till that time twelue-month leaues her Loue the sun. [The Great all-seeing burning eye of day] The thirteenth of September, the Sunne enters into Libra, Or the Ballance. Libra. September. The Great all-seeing burning eye of day, In Libraes Ballance restlesse comes to rest, Where equally his way he seemes to wey: And day and night with equall houres are drest: By these iust scales, true iustice is exprest, Which doth to times and places render right, Where wealth insults not, nor the poore opprest, But all's eu'n poyzed, like the day and night. And now this lampe of light doth here alight, Making this Signe, his Equinoctiall Inne, Whilst fruitfull trees are ouer-laden quite: (Too great a gracious guerdon for mans sinne) And as in March he 'gan to doe vs grace, So to th' Antipodes he now 'gins shew his face. [Illustrious Phœbus now declines amaine] The foureteenth of October, the Sunne enters into Scorpio. Scorpio. October. Illustrious Phœbus now declines amaine, His golden head within the Scorpion dwells. Now boystrous blasts of wind, and showres of rain, Of raging winters nigh approach foretells, From trees sharpe Autumne, all the leaues expells, For Phœbus now hath left his pleasant Innes, Now Marchants Bacchus blood both buy and sell, And Michaels Terme, lawes haruest now begins, Where many losers are, and few that wins: For law may well be cal'd contentions whip, When for a scratch, a cuffe, for pointes or pins, Will witlesse gets his neighbour on the hip. Then tone the rother vnto law will vrge, And vp they come to giue their purse a purge. [Thus Luna's brother lower doth descend] The eleuenth of Nouember, the Sunne enters into Sagitarius, Or the Archer. Sagitarius. Nouember. Thus Luna's brother lower doth descend, And at the Archer rests his radient Waine, Now winters bitter blasting stormes contend, T'assault our hemespheare, with might and maine, The fields and trees disrobed all againe, Starke naked strip'd of hearbs, of flowres, of fruits, And now the Lord, the Lowne, the Sir, the Swaine, Against the freeze, of Freeze make winter suites. Now chirping birds are all turn'd tounglesse mutes; And Shepheards swaines to sheephouse driue their sheep. Not controuersies now are in disputes At Westminster, where such a coyle they keepe; Where man doth man within the Law betosse, Till some go croslesse home by Woodcocks Crosse. [Apollo hath attain'd his lowest seat] The eleuenth of December, the Sunne enters into Capricorne, Or the Goat. Capricornus. December. Apollo hath attain'd his lowest seat, And now the shortnesse of his race is such, That though his Glory for a time be great, He giues his Sister Cynthia twice as much. Now is the welcom'st time of all the yeere, Now dye the oxen, and the fatted hogs: Now merry Christmas fils the world with cheere, And chimnies smoake with burning logge on logs. He that's a mizer all the yeere beside, Will reuell now, and for no cost will spare, A poxe hang sorrow, let the world go slide, Let's eate and drinke, and cast away all care. Thus when Apollo's at the horned Goate, He makes all Christendome with mirth to floate. [The Glorious Great Extinguisher of Night] The tenth of Ianuary, the Sunne enters into Aquarius, Or the signe of the Waterbearer. Aquarius, Ianuary. The Glorious Great Extinguisher of Night, Immures his bright translucent golden head, And from his radiant teeme he doth alight, To rest his Steeds in cold Aquarius bed. Now hory frost hath Tellus face o'rspred, And chilling numnesse whets the shauing ayre, All vegitable creatures now seeme dead. Like curelesse cures, past and repast repaire: Frigidious Ianus two-fold frozen face, Turnes moyst Aquarius into congeal'd yce: Though by the fires warme side the pot haue place, Of winters wrath it needs must know the price. At last, daies burning toarch, againe takes horse, And into wetter weather makes his course. [Now snow, and rain, and haile &amp; flauering sleet] The ninth of February, the Sunne enters into Pisces, Or the signe of the two fishes. Pisces. February. Now snow, and rain, and haile &amp; flauering sleet, (The Delphean god hath suckt from sea and land, With exhalations) now the earth they greet: Powr'd downe by Iris liberall hand, If foulefac'd February keepe true touch, He makes the toyling Plowmans prouerbe right; By night, by day, by little and by much, It fills the ditch, with either blacke or white: And as the hard cornuted butting Ram, At setting forth was Tytans daintiest dish: So to conclude his race, right glad I am, To leaue him feasting with a messe of fish. And long in Pisces he doth not remaine, But leaues the fish, and falls to flesh againe. To the Right Honourable Thomas Lord Ridgewaye, Treasurer. Thomas Ridgewaye. Anagramma. God Armes thy way. Againe, Age is made worthy. Though sinne and hell worke mortals to betray, Yet 'gainst their malice still, God Armes ths way. When life and lands, and all away must fade, By Noble actions, Age is worthy made. Certaine Sonnets made in the forme of Æquiuoques; on the destruction of Troy. [VVhen Hellen was for Priams sonne a mate] VVhen Hellen was for Priams sonne a mate, From Greece bereft by Paris &amp; his Band: Which caus'd the Greekes, the Troian minds amate, Som curs'd the boy; and other some they band: The strum pet Queene which brought the burning brand, That Illion fir'd, &amp; wrack'd old Priams Race: And on their Names long liuing shame did brand, (For head-strong lust runnes an vnbounded Race.) This beauteous peece, whose feature radiant blaze, Made Menelaus horne-mad warre to wage: And set all Troy in a combustious blaze, Whose ten yeeres triumphs scarce was worth their wage, For all their conquests, and their battring Rams, Their leaders most return'd, with heads like Rams. To the Right Honourable, the Lord Viscount Grandison. Anagramma. Harts Ioyne in loue. Thy loyall seruice to thy King, doth proue, That to thy Countrey, thy Hart Ioyns in loue. [VVith raging madnesse and with fury fell] VVith raging madnesse and with fury fell, Great Diomed, and Aiax 'eft their Tents, And in the throat of death, to blowes they fell, To make more worke for plaisters, and for tents. With blood imbruing all the Phrygian Clime, Whilst men like Autumne leaues drop dying downe: Where som th'row blood, &amp; wo?ds to honor clime, And some their mangled lims bestrows the downe: Whilst Paris with his Hellen in his Armes Imbraces her about the wastfull wast: Saw many a Gallant Knight in burnisht Armes, Who from their Tents made haste to make more waste: Who to their Tents did ne'r returne again. Thus warres makes gaine a losse, and losse a gaine. [Had Priams Queene in Cradle slaine her Sonne] Had Priams Queene in Cradle slaine her Sonne, The lustfull Paris (haplesse boy) I meane: Then Illions Towers might still haue brau'd the Sun: His death to saue their liues had beene the meane. Vnlucky lucke, when Iuno, Venus, Pallas Did craue his censure vpon Ida Mount: Whence sprung the cause that Troy &amp; Priams Palace Were burnt, which erst the skyes did seem to mo?t. Had he been drown'd or strangled with a cord, He had not rob'd Oenon of her heart: Or had he dy'd, ere Hellen did accord With him, to head her husband like a Hart. But Troy, it is thy fate, this knaue and Baggage Confounds thy state, and fire thy bag &amp; baggage. [Troyes fruitfull Queene did many children beare] Troyes fruitfull Queene did many children beare, So braue, heroicke, and so stout a Crue: Who all in noble actions did accrue, When age had made their Parents bald and bare, They made their daintlesse courage to appeare, Amidst the throngs of danger and debate: Where wars remorselesse stroke kil'd many a Peer, Whil'st swords, not words, their co?sels did debate: But bloud on bloud, their fury could not sate, For fierce Achilles did braue Hector gore: To guerdon which, the Grecian in his gore, Did wallow, whilest the Troians laughing sate. Thus did Achilles bid the world adiew For Hectors death, Reuenge did claime a due. [Ten wearie yeers these bloudy broyles did last] Ten wearie yeers these bloudy broyles did last, Vntill the Greeks had form'd a woodden Steed: Which they on Priam would bestow at last, (When force preuailes not, falshood stands in stead.) False Sinon (who so well could forge a lye, Whose traitrous eyes shed many a trech'rous teare) Knew well that in the horses wombe did lye, The wolues that Troy did all in pieces teare. Polyxena, Achilles deare-bought deare, Was hew'd in gobbets on her louers graue, King, Queene, and Troy, for Hellen paid too deare, All felt the Grecian rage, both young and graue. To Kings and Commons, death's alike, all one, Except Æneas, who escap'd alone. [Lo thus the burden of Adultrous guilt] Lo thus the burden of Adultrous guilt, I showring vengeance, Troy and Troianes saw: No age, no sexe, no beauty, Gold or guilt, Withstood foretold Cassandraes sacred saw. She often said false Hellens beautious blast Should be the cause the mighty Grecian pow'r, Their names, and fames, with infamy should blast, And how the gods on th? would vengeance powre. But poore Cassandra prophesied in vaine, She clam'rous cries (as 'twere) to sencelesse Rocks. The youths of Troy, in merry scornefull veine, Securelesse slept, whil'st lust the cradle rocks: Till bloudy burning Indignation came, And all their mirth with mourning ouercame. Certaine Sonnets: variously composed vpon diuers subiects. Sonnet. 1 True Nobility. Great is the glory of the Noble minde, Where life and death are equall in respect: If fates be good or bad, vnkinde or kinde, Not proud in freedome, nor in thrall deiect; With courage scorning fortunes worst effect, And spitting in foule Enuies cankred face. True honour thus doth baser thoughts subiect, Esteeming life a slaue, that serues disgrace. Foule abiect thoughts, become the mind that's base, That deemes there is no better life then this, Or after death doth feare a worser place, Where guilt is paid the guerdon of Amisse. But let swolne enuy swell vntill shee burst, The Noble minde defies her to her worst. Sonnet. 2. Enuy and Honour. Could Enuy dye, if Honour were deceast? She could not liue, for Honour's Enuie's food: She liues by sucking of the Noble blood, And scales the loftie top of Fames high Crest. Base thoughts compacted in the abiect brest, The Meager Monster doth nor harme, nor good: But like the wane, or waxe, of ebbe or flood, She shunnes as what her gorge doth most detest, Where heau'n-bred honour in the Noble minde, From out the Cauerns of the brest proceeds: There hell-borne Enuy shewes her hellish kind, And Vulturlike vpon their actions feeds. But here's the ods, that Honour's tree shall grow, When Enuie's rotten stump shall burne in woe. Sonnet. 3. Beauties luster. Dew drinking Phœbus hid his golden head, Balm-breathing Zephyrus lay close immur'd: The silly Lambs and Kyds lay all as dead, Skies, earth, and seas, all solace had abiur'd. Poore men and beasts, to toylesome tasks inur'd, In dropping manner spent the drowzy day: All but the Owle, whose safety night assur'd, She gladly cuts the ayre with whooting lay. When lo, the blossome of my blooming May, From out her Coach maiestickly doth rise: Then Tytan doth his radiant beames display, And clouds are vanisht from the vaulty skies. Sweet Zephryis gales reuiueth beasts and men, Madge-Howlet scuds vnto her nest agen. Sonnet. 4. Hope and Despaire. Domestick broyles my tortur'd heart inuades Twixt wau'ring Hope, and desp'rate black Despaire: To prosecute my sute the one perswades, The other frustrates all my hopes with cares. Hope sets me on, infer's shee's fayrest faire, How dire disdaine doth dwell in foulest Cels, And fell despaire calls beauty Enuies heire: Which torments me more then ten thousand hels. Loe, thus my former hope despaire expels: Mid'st which extremes whats best for me to doe: In open armes, despaire 'gainst me rebels, Hope traytor-like giues free consent thereto. And till these traytors twaine consume my citty, I restlesse rest, to rest vpon her pitty. Sonnet. 5. Three blinde Commanders. Blinde fortune, sightlesse loue, and eyelesse death, Like Great Triumue'rs swayes this earthly roome, Mans actions, affections, and very breath: Are in subiection to their fatall doome. Ther's nothing past, or presen, or to come, That in their purblinde power is not comprizde: From Crowne, to cart, from cradle to the toome, All are by them defamde, or eternizde: Why should we then esteeme this doating life (Thats in the guideance of such blind-fold rule) Whose chiefest peace, is a continuall strife, Whose gawdy pompes the pack, and man the Mule, Which liues long day, he beares, as he is able, Til deaths blacke night, doth make the graue his stable? Sonnet. 6. In the praise of musicke. Twas Musick fetch'd Euridice from hell, And rap'd grim Pluto with harmonious straines: Renowned Orpheus did with Musick quell The fiends, and ease the tortur'd of their paines. The Dolphin did account it wondrous gaines, To heare Arion play as hee did ride: Gods, fiends, fish, fowles, &amp; shepheards on the plains Melodious Musicke still hath magnifide: And ancient records plainely doe decide, How braue Orlando, Palatine of France, When he was raging mad for Meadors bride, Sweet Musicke cur'd his crazed wits mischance. For Musick's only fit for heau'ns high quire, Which though men cannot praise enough, admire. Sonnet. 7. The Map of misery. Like to the stone thats cast in deepest waue, That rests not till the bottome it hath found, So I (a wretch) inthrald in sorrowes caue, With woe and desperations fetters bound: The captiue slaue imprison'd vnder ground Doom'd, thereby fates t' expire his wofull daies, With care o'rwhelmd, with grief &amp; sorrow drownd Makes mournfull moanings and lamenting layes, Accusing, and accursing fortunes playes, Whose wither'd Autumne leauelesse leaues his tree, And banning death for his too long delayes, Remaines the onely poore despised hee. If such a one as this, the world confine, His mischiefes are his his sport compar'd with mine. Sonnet. 8. Another in prayse of musicke. No Poet crownd with euerliuing bayes (Tho art like floods should fr? his knowledge flow) He could not write enough in Musicks praise: To which, both man and Angels loue doe owe, If my bare knowledge ten times more did know, And had ingrost all arte from Pernas hill: If all the Muses should their skils bestow On me, to amplifie my barren skill: I might attempt in shew of my good will, In Musicks praise, some idle lines to write: But wanting iudgement, and my accent ill, I still should be vnworthy to indite, And run my wit on ground like ship on shelfe: For musicks praise consisteth in it selfe. A Cataplasmicall Satyre, composed and compacted of sundry simples, as salt, vineger, wormewood, and a little gall, very profitable to cure the impostumes of vice. A sauage rough-hair'd Satyre needs no guide, Wher's no way, from the way he cannot slide: Then haue am?gst you, through the brakes &amp; briers, From those who to the Cedars top aspires, Vnto the lowest shrub, or branch of broome, That hath his breeding from earths teeming womb. And now I talke of broome, of shrubs and Cedars, Me thinks a world of trees are now my leaders: To prosecute this trauell of my penne, And make comparison twixt trees and men, The Cedars and the high cloud kissing Pynes: Fecundious Oliues, and the crooked Vines: The Elme, the Ash, the Oake, the Masty Beeche, The Peare, the Apple, and the rug-gownd Peache, And many more, for it would tedious be, To name each fruitfull and vnfruitfull tree. But to proceed, to show how men, and trees In birth, in breed, in life, and death agrees: In their beginnings they haue all one birth, Both haue their nat'rall being from the earth, And heauens high hand, (where he doth please to blesse, Makes trees, or men, or fruitful, or fruitlesse. In sundry vses trees do serue mans turne, To build, t' adorne, to feed, or else to burne. Thus is mans state in all degrees like theirs, Some are got vp to th' top of honours stayres, Securely sleeping on opinions pillow, Yet as vnfruitfull, as the fruitlesse willow, And fill vp roomes, (like worthlesse trees in woods) Whose goodnesse all consists in ill got goods: He like the Cedar makes a goodly show, But no good fruite will from his greatnesse grow, Vntill he die, and from his goods depart, And then giues all away, despight his heart. Then must his friends with mourning cloth be clad, With insides merry, and with outsides sad. What though by daily grinding of the poore By bribry and extortion got his store: Yet at his death he gownes some foure-score men, And tis no doubt he was a good man then? Though in his life he thousands hath vndone, To make wealth to his cursed coffers run: If at his buriall groats a piece bee giuen, Ile warrant you, his soule's in hell, or heauen: And for this doale perhaps the beggers striues, That in the throng seuenteene doe lose their liues: Let no man tax me here, with writing lies: For what is writ, I saw with mine owne eyes: Thus men like barren trees are feld and lopt, And in the fire to burne are quickly popt: Some man perhaps whilst he on earth doth liue, Part of his vaine superfluous wealth will giue: To build of Almshouses some twelue or ten, Or more or lesse, to harbour aged men: Yet this may nothing be to that proportion, Of wealth which he hath gotten by extortion. What ist for man (his greedy minde to serue) To be the cause that thousands die and sterue: And in the end, like a vaine-glorious theefe, Will giue some ten or twelue a poore reliefe? Like robbers on the way, that take a purse, And giue the poore a mite to scape Gods curse. But know this thou, whose goods are badly gotten, When thou art in thy graue consum'd and rotten, Thine heire (perhaps) wil feast with his sweet punk, And Dice; and Drabb, and eu'ry day be drunk, Carowsing Indian Trinidado smoake, Whilst thou with Sulph'rous flames art like to choake. See, see yond gallant in the Cloke-bag breech, Hee's nothing but a Trunke cram'd full of speech: He'l sweare as if 'gainst heau'n he wars would wage, And meant to plucke downe Phœbus in his rage: When let a man but try him, hee's all oathes, And odious lies, wrapt in vnpaid for cloathes. And this Lad is a Roaring boy forsooth, An exlent morsell for the hangmans tooth. He carelesly consumes his golden pelfe, In getting which his Father damn'd himselfe: Whose soule (perhaps) in qu?chlesse fire doth broile, Whilst on the earth his sonne keepes leuell coile. Tis strange to Church what numbers daily flock, To drinke the Spring of the eternall Rocke: The great soule-sauing, Satan slaying Word, Gainst sin, death, hell, th' alconquering sacred sword, Where high Iehouahs Trumpeters sound forth From East to West, from South vnto the North: (For through all lands their Embasseyes are borne, And neuer doe againe in vaine returne:) Which either is of life to life the sauor, Or death to death, exilde from Gods sweet fauour: Which blisse or bane there's many daily heares, Who leaue their hearts at home, &amp; bring their eares, And lest their reckelesse heads, the Word should smother, As soon as't enters t'one, it's out at tother. For let a Preacher preach vntill he sweats, Denouncing heau'ns great wrath in thundring threats Gainst sin and sinners, 'gainst high hearted pride, Gainst murder which hath oft for vengeance cride, Or enuie, Lechery, Auarice, or Swearing, Or any other vice, theyle giue the hearing, And say the Preacher wondrous paines did take, And did a very learned Sermon make: But what good Reformation hence proceeds, Are Mountaine words, and little Mole-hill deeds. Tell Vs'rers they are banisht from Gods hill, Yet they'le continue in extortion still, Tell the proud Courtier, that he is but earth, He'le o're the poore insult and bragge of birth. Expostulate the great Almighties Ire, And tell the murdrer, hell shall be his hire, Yet e're he'll pocket vp the least disgrace, His en'mies guts shall be his Rapiers case. Tell daily drunkards hell shall be their lot, Thei'l knocke and call to haue the tother pot. Tell Panders, Bawds, knaues, and adultrous whores, How they in hell must pay their cursed scores: Tell Mizer chuffes who charitie doe banish, How they from heau'n, eternally must vanish: Tell all in generall of their liues amisse, And tell them that hels bottomelesse abysse, Must be their portions if they not repent, Till true repentance heau'ns iust wrath preuent: Yet when the Preacher all he can hath told, Soules vnto sinne are daily bought and sold. The Mizer with his lecherie of Chinke, On earth will giue his dropsie soule to drinke, And though the Word beat on his Anuile heart, From Vs'ry and extortion he'l not part, The piebald Gallant to the Church will come To heare his soules saluations totall summe: Yet his high pride is in such hauty dotage, Forgets he's sprung from a poore country Cotage. The murdrer heares how reprobated Caine Was curst of God, that had his brother slaine, Yet when hee's from the Church, forgets it all, And stabs a man for taking of the wall. Should I through all mens seu'rall actions runne, I know my businesse neuer would be done. The rich man hates the poore man, and the poore Doth enuie gainst the rich man for his store. Thus is the blest soules euerliuing Bread, In bounteous measure all the earth or'espread: Some on the high way falls and takes no roote, But is of no esteeme, trod vnder foote: Some falles on stones, and some alights on thornes, Deuour'd with fowles, or choak'd with scoffs or scornes. Some little portion fals in fruitfull ground, Th'encrease of which is to be seldome found. For let men waigh their good deeds with their bad, For thousand ils, one good will scarce be had. And yet no doubt but God in store doth keepe His neere deare children, his best flocke of sheepe. For though vnto the world they are not knowne, Yet tis sufficient God doth know his owne. For though Elias thought himselfe was all That had not offered sacrifice to Ball: Iehouah answer'd him, seuen thousand more, In Israel did this Idol not adore. But who so much in this vile life are hated, As those which to saluation are created? For let a man refraine to drab or dice, Out fie vpon him then, he's too precise. Let him forbeare to lie, to sweare, or banne, O bang him rascall, he's a Puritan. And sure I think the Deuill by that false name Hath added thousands soules vnto his flame. Some man ere hee'l be cal'd a Puritan, Will turne a damned Machiauilian, A Libertine, Papist, or else what not? To keepe his name from so impure a blot. I speake not this regarding their estate, Who from our Church themselues doe separate, For good indifferent Ceremonious rites, And 'gainst our Churches gouernment backbites. Nor doe I praise the louing Sisters loue, Who often makes the Brethren's spirits moue, And if 'twere lawfull (they would gladly kno) To dresse their meate the Sabbath day or no. And wherefore now the Churchmen of these daies, Ride to and fro, to preach so many waies, When Christ to his Apostles gaue in charge, That they should seek and teach all nations large, The way, that in his Lawes they might abide, Christ bade them goe, he bade them not to ride, These idle questionists, these schismatickes, I, hold no bettter then ranke heretickes: But this I thinke not well, when honest hearts Shall haue this impure name without desarts, How then can my comparing be gainestood? For men are like to trees, some bad, some good. But tarry, Satyre, thou too fast dost trot, There's one thing more I had almost forgot, And this is it, of Ale-houses, and Innes, Wine-Marchants, Vintners, Brewers, who much wins By others losing, I say more or lesse Whose sale of hufcap liquor doe professe, Should neuer bee to any office cald, Or in no place of Iustice be instal'd: The reason is, they gaine by mens excesse Of diuellish quaffing, and damn'd drunkennesse. For why, should men be moderate in their drinke, Much Beere, and bottle-Ale should stand and stinke: And Mounsieur Claret, and sweet Signior Sacke, Would lowre and turne vnto the Marchants wrack; The Vintners then within their cellers deepe, Such coniuring at midnight would not keepe. This swynish sinne hath man of sense bereauen, To bandy balles of blasphemy 'gainst heauen, It is the way, the dore, the porch, the gate, All other vices enter in thereat. A drunken man in rage will stabbe his brother, Hee'l Cuckold his owne father, whore his mother, Reuile and curse, sweare &amp; speak dangerous treason, And when he's sober, hangs for 't by th' weason. How then should men a reformation giue, To mend those crimes, that by those crimes do liue? The Patriarke Noah did first plant the Vine, And first did feele the powerfull force of wine, And righteous Lot, by wine depriu'd of wit, Foule Incest with his daughters did commit. And Holophernes drunken lay in bed, Whilst strong-faith'd, weake-arm'd Iudith cut offs head. Great Alexander out his Fauchion drewe, And being drunke, his best friend Clitus slew. If euery haire vpon the heads of men Were quils, and euery quill were made a pen: Were Earth to paper turn'd, and Seas to inke, And all the world were writers, yet I thinke, They could not write the mischiefs done by drink. And such a custome men haue tane therein, That to be drunke, is scarce accounted sinne, But honest recreatiue merriment The time is term'd that is in tippling spent. A Marchants ship is richly fraught, ariues, And for thanksgiuing that so well he thriues, He makes a feast, and store of money spends, Inuites his kinsfolke, creditors, and friends: Where stormes, and Rocks and Pirats are forgot, And triumphs made to Bacchus and the Pot. A rich mans wife's deliuered of of a boy, And all the houshold must be drunk for ioy. The prisoner that's condemn'd to die and hang, And by reprieue hath scap'd that bitter pang, Will presently his old acquaintance call, And ere he giues God thanks, to drinking fall. Why drunkards common are, as lies, or stealing, And sober men are scarce, like honest dealing. When men doe meet, the second word that's spoke, Is, Where's good liquour, and a pipe of smoake? The labouring man that for his hire doth serue, Let Landlord tarry, wife and children sterue, With not a bit of bread within the house, Yet hee'l sit on the Ale-bench and carowse. Thus like an Inundation drink doth drowne The Rich, the Poore, the Courtier and the Clowne. Since then to be a drunkard, is to be The sincke of Incest, and Sodomitry, Of Treason, swearing, fighting, beg'ry, murder, And diuers more, I then will goe no furder: But here my Satyrs stinging whip I'le waste In lashing dropsie drunkards out of taste. How then can it be possible that such, Who sell Wine, Beere, or Ale, doe gaine so much, Should punish drunkards, as the Law commands, In whose vaine spending, their most gaining stands? It were all one as if a Mercer did To weare Silke, Veluet, Cloth of Gold forbid. And Victlers may as wisely punish those, From whom their daily drinks, great gettings growes. I would haue all old drunkards to consent To put a Bill vp to the Parlament: That those by quaffing that haue spent their wealth, Consum'd their times, their memory, their health, And by excessiue spending now are bare, That Merchants, Brewers, Vintners, should prepare Some Hospitals to keepe them in their age, And cloath, and feed them, from fierce famines rage: For euery one whose hard vnlucky lots, Haue beene to be vndone by empting pots, I hold it fit that those the pots that filde, Should contribute those Almes houses to build. Yet one obiection would this bill debarre, Too many drunkards there already are; And rather then this law would bate their store, I feare 'twould make them twise as many more. For why, to drink most men would be too bold, Because they would haue pensions being old. And men (of purpose to this vice would fall, To be true beads-men to this hospitall. Then let it be as it already is. But yet I hold it not to be amisse) Those Drinke-sellers, from office to exclude. And so for that my Satyr doth conclude, I could rippe vp a Catalogue of things, Which thousand thousands to damnation flings, But all my paines at last would be but idle. It is not man can mens Affections bridle. Sinne cannot be put downe with inke and paper, No more then Sol is lightned with a Taper. To Mistresse Rose. Anagramma. Sore. Sound Rose, though Sore thy Anagram doth meane, Mistake it not, it meanes no sore vncleane: But it alludes vnto the lofty skie, To which thy vertue shall both Sore and flye. To my approued good friend M?. Robarte Cvddner. Anagramma. Record and be true. My thoughts Record, and their account is true, I scarce haue better friends aliue then you. A nest of Epigrams. Fortune. 1. Tis Fortunes glory to keepe Poets poore, And cram weake witted Idiots with her store: And tis concluded in the wisest schooles, The blinded drab shall euer fauour fooles. Epigram 2. Loue. Loue is a dying life, a liuing death, A vapor, shadow, bubble, and a breath: An idle bable, and a paltry toy, Whose greatest Patron is a blinded boy: But pardon loue, my iudgement is vniust, For what I spake of loue, I meant of lust. Epigram 3. Death. Those that scape fortune, &amp; th'extremes of loue, Vnto their longest homes, by death are droue: Where Cæsars, Kæsars, Subiects, Abiects must Be all alike, consum'd to durt and dust: Death endeth all our cares or cares encrease, It sends vs vnto lasting paine, or peace. Epigram 4. Fame. VVhen Fortune, Loue and Death their tasks haue doon, Fame makes our liues through many ages run: For be our liuing actions good or ill, Fame keepes a record of our doings still: By Fame Great Iulius Cæsar euer liues; And Fame, infamous life to Nero giues. Epigram 5. Time. All making, marring, neuer turning Time To all that is, is period, and is prime: Time weares out Fortune, Loue, and Death &amp; Fame, And makes the world forget her proper name. Ther's nothing that so long on earth can last, But in conclusion, Time will lay it wast. Epigram 6. Kamee, kathee. My Muse hath vow'd, reuenge shall haue her swindge To catch a Parrat in the Woodcocks sprindge. Epigram 7. Solus. The land yeelds many Poets, were I gone, The water sure (I durst besworne) had none. Epigram 8. Selfe-conceit. Some Poets are, whose high pitcht lofty straines Are past the reach of euery vulgar wight: To vnderstand which, twill amaze weake braines. So mysticall, sophisticall they write: No maruell others vnderstand them not, For they scarce vnderstand themselues, I wot. Epigram 9. A couple. One read my booke, and said it wanted wit, I wonder if he meant himselfe, or it: Or both: if both, two fooles were met I troe, That wanted wit, and euery foole doth so. Epigram 10. Bacchus and Apollo. The thigh-borne bastard of the thundring Ioue, (Wh? mens inuenti?s are of wit most hollow) He with his spitefull iuice their sprites doth mooue, Vnto th' harmonious musicke of Apollo: And in a word, I would haue all men know it, He must drinke wine, that means to be a Poet. Epigram 11. Of translation. I vnderstand or knowe no forraigne tongue, But their translations I doe much admire: Much art, much paines, much study doth belong, And (at the least) regard should be their hyre. But yet I would the French had held together, And kept their pox, and not translate them hether. Epigram 12. Natures counterfeite. When Adam was in Paradise first plac'd, An dw?? the rule of mortal things was grac'd, Then roses, pinkes and fragrant gilliflowres, Adornd &amp; deckd forth Edens blessed bowres: But now each Gill weares flowres, each Punk hath pinks, And roses garnish Gallants shooes, me thinks: When rugged Winter, robs fairy Floraes treasure, Puncks can haue pinks and roses at their pleasure. Epigram 13. The deuill take bribery. A man attach't for murdering of a man, Vnto the for-man of his Iury sent Two score angels, begging what he can, He would his conscience straine, law to preuent: That his offences Iudge, might iudge no further, But make manslaughter of his wilfull murther: The verdict was manslaughter to the Iudge. The Iudge demanded how it could be so? The for-man said his conscience much did grudge: But forty angels did perswade him no. Well (quoth the Iudge) this case shall murther be, If halfe those angels not appeare to me. Thus when the law men to confusion driues, The godlesse angels will preserue their liues. Epigram 14. The deuill is a knaue. Isbell dislikes the surplusse and the cope, And calls them idle vestments of the Pope: And mistresse Maude would goe to Church full faine, But that the corner cap makes her refraine: And Madam Idle is offended deepe, The Preacher speakes so lowde, she cannot sleepe: Lo, thus the deuill fowes contentious seed, Whence sects, &amp; schismes, and heresics do breed. Epigram 15. Kissing goes by fauour. Bembus the Burgomaster liues in paine, With the Sciatica, and the Cathar. Rich Grundo of the dropsie doth complaine, And with the Gowt these mizers troubled are. If Tinkers, Coblers, Botchers, be infected With Bembus Lamenesse or with Grundoes Gowt: Like pocky fellowes they must bee reiected, And as infectious rascals bee kept out, And not come neere where wholesome people flocks: Thus rich mens sicknesses, are poore mens pocks. Epigram 16. Deere no Venison. Precilla alwaies calls her husband Deere, Belike shee bought him at too deare a rate, Or else to make the case more plaine appeare, Like to a Deere she hath adorn'd his pate: If it be so, god Vulcan send her lucke; That she may liue to make her Deere a Bucke. Epigram 17. Euery thing is prettie when it is little. There is a saying old, (but not so wittie) That when a thing is little, it is prettie: This doating age of ours it finely fits; Where many men thought wise, haue pretty wits. Epigram 18. I meane somewhat. One ask'd mee what my Melancholy meanes? I answer'd, 'Twas because I wanted meanes. He ask'd what I did by my answer meane? I told him still, my meanes were too too meane. He offer'd me to lend me pounds a score. I answer'd him, I was too much in score. He finding me in this crosse answ'ring veine, Left me in want to wish for wealth in vaine. Epigram 19. Faith without workes. Amongst the pure reformed Amsterdammers, (Those faithfull Friday feasting capon cr?mers) Only in them (they say) true faith doth lurke: But 'tis a lazy faith, 'twill doe no worke. O should it worke, ther's many thousand feares, 'Twould set the world together by the eares. Epigram 20. Partiality. Strato the Gallant reeles alongst the street, His addle head's too heauy for his feete: What though he sweare and swagger, spurn &amp; kick, Yet men will say the Gentleman is sick? And that 'twere good to learn where he doth dwell, And helpe him home, because he is not well. Strait staggers by a Porter, or a Carman, As bumsie as a fox'd flapdragon German: And though the Gentlemans disease and theirs, Are parted onely with a paire of sheares: Yet they are Drunken knaues, and must to th' stocks, And there endure a world of flouts and mocks. Thus wh? braue Strato's wits with wine are shrunk, The same disease will make a begger drunke. Epigram 21. A keeper of honesty. Deliro should of honesty be full, And store of wisedome surely is within him. What though he dally with a painted Trull, And shee to folly daily seemes to win him? Yet in him sure is honesty good store, He vtters but his knauerie with a whore. For he that spends too free, shall surely want, Whilst he that spares, will liue in wealthy state: So wit and honesty, with such are scant, Who part with it at euery idle rate: But men must needes haue honesty and wit, That like Deliro neuer vtter it. Epigram 22. All's one, but one's not all. To wonder and admire, is all one thing, If as Synonimies the words be tooke: But if a double meaning from them spring, For double sence your Iudgement then must looke. As once a man all soild with durt and mire, Fell downe, and wonder'd not, but did admire. Epigram 23. Mistresse fine bones. Fine Parnell wonderfully likes her choyce, In hauing got a husband so compleate, Whose shape and mind doth wholy her reioyce: At bed, board, and abroad, he's alwaies neate: Neate can he talke, and feed, and neatly tread, Neate are his feete, but most neate is his head. Epigram 34. A supposed Construction. Mary and Mare, Anagrammatiz'd, The one is Army, and the other Arme, In both their names is danger Moraliz'd, And both alike, doe sometimes good or harme, Mare's the sea, and Mare's Arme's a riuer, And Mary's Armie's all for whatl' yee giue her. Epigram 25. Death is a Iuggler. A rich man sicke, would needs go make his will, And in the same, he doth command and will One hundred pound vnto his man call'd Will, Because hee alwaies seru'd him with good will: But all these wills did proue to Will but vaine, His master liues and hath his health againe. Epigram 26. Mistresse Grace onely by name. Grace gracelesse, why art thou vngracious Grace? Why dost thou run so lewdly in the race? The cause wherefore thy goodnesse is so scant, Is cause, what most thou hast, thou most dost want. Epigram 27. Prudence. Tis strange that Prudence should be wilde and rude, Whose very name doth Modesty include: The reason is, for ought that I can see, Her name and nature doe not well agree. Epigram 28. Mercy. My Mercy hates me, what's the cause I pray, Tis'cause I haue no money, shee doth say. O cruell Mercy, now I plainly see, Without a fee no mercie comes from thee. Yet in conclusion, euery idle gull Perceiues thy Mercy is vnmercifull. Epigram 29. Faith. O faith, thou alwaies vnbeleeuing art, Faith in thy name, and faithlesse in thy heart. Thou credidst all, but what is true and good, In vertue rude, in vice well vnderstood. Epigram 30. Vpon my selfé. My selfe I like to an vntun'd Viall, For like a Viall I am in a Case: And whoso of my fortunes makes a triall, Shall (like to me) be strung and tuned base. And Trebles Troubles he shall neuer want: But heeres the Period of my mischiefes All, Though Base and Trebles, fortune did me grant, And Meanes, but yet alas, they are too small. Yet to make vp the Musicke, I must looke The Tenor in the cursed Counter booke. Epigram 31. A Rope for Parrat. VVhy doth the Parrat cry a Rope, a Rope? Because hee's cag'd in prison out of hope. Why doth the Parrat call a Boate, a Boate? It is the humour of his idle note. O pretty Pall, take heed, beware the Cat. (Let Watermen alone, no more of that) Since I so idlely heard the Parrat talke, In his owne language, I say, Walke, knaue, walke. Epigram 32. Constants. Inconstant Constants all-bewitching feature, Hath made faire Constance an inconstant Creature, Her Godmother was very much to blame, To giue Inconstancy a constant name. But 'twas a woman nam'd her so contrary, And womens tongues and hearts doe euer vary. Epigram 33. Vpon the burning of the Globe. Aspiring Phaeton with pride inspir'd, Misguiding Phœbus Carre, the world he fir'd: But Ouid did with fiction serue his turne, And I in action sawe the Globe to burne. Epigram 34. Late Repentance. A greedy wretch did on the Scriptures looke, And found recorded in that Sacred booke, How such a man with God should sure preuaile, Who clad the naked, and visit those in Iaile, And then he found how he had long mistak'd, And oftentimes had made the cloathed nak'd: In stead of visiting th'opprest in mones, He had consum'd them to the very bones. Yet one day he at leasure would repent, But sudden death Repentance did preuent. Epigram 35. Not so strange as true. The stately Stag when he his hornes hath shed, In sullen sadnesse he deplores his losse: But when a wife cornutes her husbands head, His gaines in hornes he holds an extreme Crosse: The Stag by losing doth his losse complaine, The man by gaining doth lament his gaine. Thus whether hornes be either lost or found, They both the loser and the winner wound. Epigram 36. A Wordmonger. Mans vnderstanding's so obnubilate, That when thereon I doe excogitate, Intrinsicall and querimonious paines Doe puluerise the concaue of my braines, That I could wish man were vnfabricate, His faults he doth so much exaggerate. Epigram 37. Plaine dunstable. Your words passe my capatchity good zur, But ich to proue need neuer to goe vur: Cha knowne men liue in honest exclamation, Who now God wot liue in a worser fashion. The poore man grumbles at the rich mans store, And rich men daily doe expresse the poore. Epigram 38. Reason. Knowest thou a Traitor plotting damned Treason? Reveale him, tis both loialty and Reason. Knowest thou a thiefe will steale at any season? To shun his company thou hast good reason. Seest thou a villaine hang vp by the weason? Hee hangs by reason that he wanted reason. Good men are scarce, and honest men are geason. To loue them therfore, tis both right and reason, More I could say, but all's not worth two peason: And therefore to conclude, I hold it reason. Epigram 39. Out of the pan into the fire. Tom senselesse to the death doth hate a play: But yet he' play the drunkard euery day. He railes at plaies, and yet doth ten times worse, He'l dice, he'l bowle, he'l whore, he'l swear, he'l curs, When for one two pence (if his humor please) He might go see a play, and scape all these, But tis mans vse in these pestiferous times; To hate the least, and loue the greatest crimes. Epigram 40. A Poets similitude. A poet rightly may be termed fit An abstract, or Epitome of wit: Or like a Lute that others pleasures breed, Is fret and strung, their curious eares to feed, That scornfully distaste it, yet tis knowne, It makes the hearers sport, but it selfe none. A Poet's like a taper, burnt by night, That wastes it selfe, in giuing others light. A Poet's the most foole beneath the skies, He spends his wits in making Idiots wise, Who when they should their thankfulnesse returne, They pay him with disdaine, contempt and scorne. A Puritane is like a Poets purse, For both do hate the crosse (what crosse is worse?) Epigram 41. Mecanas Epitaph. Here lies the Steward of the Poets god, Who whilst on earth his loued life abod. Apollo's Daughters, and the heires of Ioue, His memorable bounty did approue: His life, was life to Poets, and his death Bereau'd the Muses of celestiall breath. Had Phœbus fir'd him from the loftie skies, That Phœnix like another might arise, From out his odorif'rus sacred embers, Whose lou'd liues losse, poore Poetry remembers. This line is the same backward, as it is forward, and I will giue any man fiue shillings apiece for as many as they can make in English. Lewd did I liue, &amp; euil did I dwel. An Apologie for Water-men: Dedicated to Nowell, and Robert Clarke Esquires, Masters of his Maiesties Barges; and to the rest of the Masters, the Assistants of the Company of Watermen. Svch imputations, and such daily wrongs, Are laid on Watermen, by enuious to?gs. To cleare the which, if I should silent be, 'Twere basenesse, and stupidity in me. Nor doe I purpose now with inke and pen, To write of them, as they are Watermen: But this I speake, defending their vocation, From slanders false, and idle imputation. Yet should I onely of the men but speake, I could the top of Enuies Coxcombe breake. For I would haue all men to vnderstand, A Waterman's a man by Sea or Land, And on the land and sea, can seruice do, To serue his King, as well as other too: He'll guard his Country both on seas and shore, And what (a Gods name) can a man doe more? Like double men they well can play indeed The Soldiers, and the Saylers for a need. If they did yeerely vse to scowre the Maine, As erst they did, in wars twixt vs and Spaine, I then to speake, would boldly seeme to dare, One Sailer with two Soldiers should compare. But now sweet peace their skill at Sea so duls, That many are more fit to vse their sculs, Then for the sea, for why? the want of vse, Is Arts confusion, and best skils abuse. And not to be too partiall in my words, I think no Company more knaues affords: And this must be the reason, because farre Aboue all Companies their numbers are: And where the multitude of men most is, By consequence there must be most amisse. And sure of honest men it hath as many, As any other Company hath any. Though not of wealth they haue superfluous store: Content's a Kingdome, and they seek no more. Of Mercers, Grocers, Drapers, men shall finde, Men that to loose behauiour are inclinde. Of Goldsmiths, Silkmen, Clothworkers, and Skinners, When they are at the best, they all are sinners. And drunken rascalls are of euery Trade, Should I name all, I o'r the bootes should wade? If Watermen be onely knaues alone, Let all that's faultlesse cast at them a stone. Some may reply to my Apology: How they in plying are vnmannerly, And one from tother, hale, and pull, and teare, And raile, and brawle, and curse, and ban, &amp; sweare. In this I'l not defend them with excuses, I alwaies did, and doe hate those abuses. The honest vse of this true trade I sing, And not th' abuses that from thence doe spring. And sure no Company hath Lawes more strict, Then Watermen, which weekely they inflict Vpon offenders, who are made pay duely Their fines, or prison'd, 'cause they plide vnruly. They keepe no shops, nor sell deceitfull wares, But like to Pilgrims, trauell for their fares, And they must aske the question where they goe, If men will goe by water yea or no? Which being spoke aright, the fault's not such, But any Tradesman (sure) will doe as much. The Mercer, as you passe along the way, Will aske you what d'e lacke? come neer I pray. The Draper, whose warme ware doth clad the back, Will be so bold as aske ye, What d'e lack? The Goldsmith with his siluer and his gold, To aske you, What d'e lack? he will be bold. This being granted as none can deny, Most Trades aswell as Watermen doe ply: If in their plying they doe chance to iarre, They doe but like the Lawyers at the Barre, Who plead as if they meant by th'eares to fall, And when the Court doth rise, to friendship fall. So Watermen, that for a fare contends, The fare once gone, the Watermen are friends. And this I know, and therefore dare maintaine, That he that truely labours and takes paine, May with a better Conscience sleepe in bed, Then he that is with ill got thousands sped. So well I like it, and such loue I owe Vnto it, that I'll fall againe to Rowe: 'Twill keepe my health from falling to decay, Get money, and chase Idlenesse away. I'm sure it for Antiquity hath stood, Since the worlds drowning vniuersall Flood, And howsoeuer now it rise or fall, The Boate in Noah, Deluge carried all. And though our wits be like our purses, bare, With any Company wee'll make compare To write a Verse, prouided that they be No better skild in Schollership then wee. And then come one, come thousands, nay, come all, And for a wager wee'll to Versing fall. Epilogue to those that know what they haue read, and how to censure. To you whose eares and eyes haue heard &amp; seene This little pamphlet, and can iudge betweene That which is good, or tol'rable, or ill, If I with Artlesse Nature wanting skill, Haue writ but ought, that may your thoughts content, My Muse hath then accomplisht her intent. Your fauors can preserue me, but your frownes My poore inuentions in obliuion drownes. With tolerable friendship let me craue You will not seeke to spill, what you may saue. But for the wrymouth'd Critick that hath read, That mewes, &amp; puh's, and shakes his brainlesse head, And saies my education or my state; Doth make my verse esteem'd at lower rate, To such a one this answer I doe send, And bid him mend, before he discommend. His Enuy vnto me, will fauours prooue, The hatred of a foole breeds wise-mens loue. My Muse is iocund that her labours merits To be malign'd and scornd by Enuious spirits: Thus humbly I craue pardon of the best, Which being gaind, Sir reuerence for the rest. FINIS. A MEMORIALL OF ALL THE ENGLISH MONARCHS, being in number 151. from Brute to King Charles. TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, Lionel Lord Viscount Cranefield, Earle of Middlesex, &amp;c. My humble Muse, in lofty manner sings The 7. Kingdomes were, 1. Kent. 2 South-Saxons, Sussex and Surry. 3 East-Angles, Norfolke, and Cambridge-shire. 4 West-Saxon, Barkshire, Deuonshire, Somersetshire, and Cornewell. 5 Mertia, Glostershire, Herefordshire, Worcester, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Cheshire, Warwike, Leycester, North, Oxford, Buckingham, Bedford, and halfe Hartfordshire. 6 East-Saxon, Essex, Middlesex, and halfe Hartfordshire. 7 Northumberland diuided to two Kingdomes, Deyra and Bernicia, all brought to one Monarchy by Eghert King of West-Saxons, and called England, 1968. yeeres after Brute.A Catalogue of Englands mighty Kings: At first I do begin with Troian brvte, And following Chronicles I do dispute, Proceeding briefely with their Raignes and Names, Till these blest dayes of our best Monarch Iames, Tis but an Argument thats written here, That in such time such and such Princes were: But he that meanes their Actions more to know, May read Boetius, Hollinshed, or Stow, Or our true labouring Moderne Master How, Which Authors, Learned Iudgement do allow: Or if youle see how former times doe runne, Reade the laborious paines of Middleton. We haue had Kings since Brute of royall Blood, One hundred forty sixe, some bad, some good, Foure Queenes in all, this time did only Raigne, Whose Memories in Histories remaine. So in two thousand and seuen hundred yeeres, We had thrice 50 Princes it appeares. This Kingdome here was fiue times won and lost, And Kings (as God decreed) oft chang'd and tost. Sometimes one swaid the Scepter, sometime twaine, And sometime seuen at once did rule and raigne, Till sixe (by bloudy warres) lost life and throne, And valiant Egbert ioyn'd them all in one. But since (through Heauens high prouidence) I see, Tis growne more great, and greater like to be. Long may He liue, by whom in one 'tis guided, And may they sinke that wish't againe diuided. Then (Noble Lord) with good acceptance take This Poem, for the Royall Subiects, sake, And though it be not compleate as it should, Beare with it, and accept of what I could, The matter's worthy, though the manner's poore, VVhich makes me heere your Patronage implore, And may you be externall and internall, Blest and aduanc'd to happinesse eternall. Your Honours in all obseruance to be commanded, Iohn Taylor. [The first part.] BRVTE, THE FIRST KING OF BRITTAINE, began his Reigne, I. Brvte. Anno mundi, 2858. Before Christ, 1108. Æneas from subuerted Troy exilde, In Tuscan wedded King Latinus childe: By whom the Realme of Italy he gain'd, And after he had 3 yeeres fully raign'd He died, and left Ascanius in his stead: To whom Siluius Posthumus did succeed. From which Posthumus Royall loynes did spring, Brute being of the age of 15 yeeres, as he shot at a wild beast, the arrow glanced vnfortunately and slew his Father Sinius Æneas, for the which he was exiled, and came into this Land, then called Albyon. I follow the common opinion: for many Writers doe neither write or allow of Brutes being here, accounting it a dishonor for our Nation, to haue originall from a Paricide, and one that deriued his descent from the Goddesse (alias strumpet) Venus. Howsoeuer, Histories are obscured and clouded with ambiguities, some burnt, lost, defaced by antiquity; and some abused by the malice, ignorance, or partialitie of Writers so that truth is hard to be found. Amongst all which variations of Times and Writers, I must conclude there was a BRVTE.Great Brutus, Brittaines first commanding King: The people then were (here) all voyd of pride, Borne Naked, Naked liu'd, and Naked dy'd. Three Sonnes Brute left, Locrinus was his Heire To England, Cambria (Wales) was Cambers share, To Albanact (the youngest) 'twas his lot, To sway the Scepter of the valiant Scot. Thus 'mongst his Sonnes this Ile he did diuide, And after twenty foure yeeres Reigne he dy'd. Locrine, 20. yeeres, 1084. Locrinus, Eldest of old Brutus Sonnes, By Valour vanquisht the inuading Hunnes: He chas'd them, &amp; their power did quite confound, And their King Humber was in The Riuer of Humber tooke the name from the drowned King of the Huns, now Hungarians. Humber drown'd: This Locrine had a Queene, faire Guendoline was daughter vnto Corineus, Duke of Cornewall. Estrild was a beautious Lady of King Humbers, whom Locrinus tooke prisoner. Guendolin, Yet folly led him to the Paphæan sinne, Besotted sence, and blood with lust inflam'd, He lou'd a beautie, Beautious Estrild nam'd, By whom he had a Daughter, Sabrin hight, In whome the King had whole and sole delight, For which the Queene made war vpon her Lord: And in the Fight she put him to the Sword; And after a reuengefull bloody slaughter, Queene Guendoline tooke Estrild and her daughter, And drownd them both (to qu?ch her ielous flame) And so from Sabrine, Seauerne got the name. Q. Guendoline, 1064. About this time Saul was King of Israel. VVhen 15. yeeres this Queen had wisely raign'd, She dy'd, &amp; then her Son the kingdome gain'd. Madan, 1009. VVhen forty yeers this King had rul'd this Ile, (As Stories say) he died a death most vile: The wide-mouth'd Wolfe, and keene-tusk'd brutish Bore, Did eate his Kingly flesh, &amp; drinke his gore. Mempricius raigned 20. yeeres, 991. Mempricius base, his brother Manlius slew, And got th? Crowne, by murder, not as due: Maids, wiues, and widdowes, he by force deflowr'd: He liu'd a Beast, and dy'd, by a Beast, deuour'd. Ebranke, 989. King Dauid reigned ouer Israel. At Edinburgh the Castle he did found, Alcluid &amp; York, he built new from the ground: He builded Bambrough, and reigned sixty yeeres, Belou'd, as it in Chronicles appeares. Brute the second, 929. If any noble act Brute Greeneeshield did, Hee's wrong'd, because from Histories th'are hid: Twelue yeeres he rul'd, that's all I of him read, And how at Yorke, hee lyeth buried. Leil. 917. Leil Carleile built, and raign'd yeeres twenty fiue, And as Fame still keepes dead mens acts aliue: So Leil (though dead) shall euer liue by Fame, He lyes at Carleile, which himselfe did frame. Rudhudibrasse, 892. This King built Canterbury, Winchester, And Shaftbury, he from the ground did reare: And after twenty nine yeeres reigne was past, At Winchester sore sicke, he breath'd his last. Bladud reign'd 20. 863. Baathe was by Bladud to perfection brought, By Necromanticke Arts, to flye hee sought: As from a Towre he thought to scale the Sky, He brake his necke, because he soar'd too high. Leire, 844. Leeire (as the Story saies) three daughters had, The youngest good, the other two too bad: Yet the old King lou'd th? that wrong'd him most, She that lou'd him, he banisht from his Coast. False Gonorel and Ragan, he betweene Them gaue the Kingdome, making each a Queene. But young Cordeilla wedded was by chance, To Aganippus, King of fertile France: The eldest Daughters did reiect their Sire, For succour to the young'st hee did retire, By whose iust aide the Crowne againe he gain'd; And dyed when he full forty yeeres had reign'd. Yeeres before Christ. Qu. Cordeilla, 805. Mad Morgan, an vnmanner'd Cunedagne, Their A?t Cordeilla with fierce war did plague They vanquish'd her, and her in Prison threw. And hauing reign'd fiue yeeres, her selfe she slew. Morgan Cunedagus, 800. Then Morgan did 'gainst Cunedague contend, And at Glamorgan, Morgan had his end, Then Cunedagus sole King did abide, Full three and thirty yeeres, and then he dyed. Riuallo, before Christ, 766. Three daies it rain'd blood, when Riuallo reign'd. And great mortalitie the Land sustain'd; Hee forty six yeeres rul'd in Kingly State, And then surrendred to all humane Fate. Gurgustus, 721. Scicillius, 684. A common Drunkard was this wicked King, Which vice did many other vices bring, Yeeres thirty eight, the Diadem he wore, Scicillius next raignd nine and forty more. Iago, 636. Kimmacus, 612. Of these two Kings, small mention I doe finde, They left bare Names (for memorie) behinde; One twentie fiue yeeres: th'other fifty foure, Had in this Land Commanding Regall power. Gorbodug, 559. Gorbodug next did in the Throne succeed, Was sixty three yeeres King, and last decreed, 'Twixt his two Sonnes this Kingdome to diuide, At Yorke hee's buried, where in peace hee dy'd. Ferex, and Porex, 496. Porex, in Fight his brother Ferex kil'd, For which their mother, Porex heart blud spil'd: These murthers mercilesse, did quite deface, These Princes, last of Royall Brutus Race. Mulmutius Donwallo, 441. The Land vnguided, Kinglesse did remaine, Till great Mulmutius did the Wreathe obtaine. He builded Temples, made Lawes, Ploughs, highwaies, And 40. yeeres he liu'd in fame and praise. Bellinus and Brennus reigned 26. yeeres. 401. These brethren did diuide the Realme in twaine, But Kings can brooke no partnership in reigne; They fell at oddes, and Brennus fled, subdude With slaughter of his warlike multitude. To France he scap'd, and was receiu'd in State, In London, Belline builded Bellinsgate, Braue Brennus conquer'd Italy and Rome, Bellinus lies heere in an honour'd Tombe. Gurguintus, 373. Gvrguintus was Belinus first-borne sonne, Victoriously he Denmarke ouer-runne: He the vnpeopled Ireland did supply, Reign'd nineteene yeeres a King, and then did dye. Guinthelinus, 456. He married Mercia a renowned Dame, From whom the iust, wife, Mercian Statutes came: He sixe and twenty yeeres the Scepter swaide, And then with honour in his Tombe was laide. Cecilius, 330. Kimarus, 223. Seuen yeeres Cecilius kept the Regall Chaire, Three yeeres Kimarus rul'd as his sole Heire; The Syre with loue did well and iustly reigne, His sonne Kimarus was a hunting slaine. Elanius, 321. Elanius (as most Histories agree) Was King of Brittaine yeeres iust three times three: What Acts he did, or what Lawes he decreed, They are vnwrit, and therefore are vnread. Morindus reigned 8 yeeres, 311. This King Morindus, valiant more then wise, A rau'ning Monster from the Sea did rise: Which many people to destruction brought, Who kil'd this braue King as he brauely fought. Gorbomanus 303. This King eleuen yeers wore the Brittain crown, He founded Cambridge, &amp; built Grantham Town; His subiects peace, past Kingdomes he prefer'd, Lou'd and bewail'd, at London was inter'd. Archigalo, and Elidurus. 392. These brothers were not Kings both at one time, But for extortion (an vnkingly crime, The Eldest hauing gaind his Subiects hate) Depos'd, and Elidurus got the State. But he (not greedy after worldly reigne) To Archigalo gaue it vp againe. Rul'd tenne yeeres more: thus twenty yeeres in all, His State Maiesticke, did twice rise and fall. Elidurus, 272. Vigenius, Peredurus, 270. Then Archigale beeing dead and gone, Good Elidure two yeers kept Brittaines Throne. Vigenius, Peredurus two yeeres more, Thrust Elidure from all the sway he bore, But they both dy'd the third time he was crown'd. Elidurus, 261. And reigned foure yeeres more, belou'd, renown'd. Once subiect, twice a slaue, and thrice a King; Thus Fortunes fauours vp and downe did fling. Lud reigned II. yeeres, 66. A long time after Troynouant was fram'd, It was by Lud, Kair-Lud, or Lud-stone nam'd. He made it strong with Battlements and Towres, Defensiue against foes inuasiue pow'rs. Of free Stone for Free-men Ludgate hee founded, Where freemen (wanting freedom) are confounded. He dy'd and left two Sonnes, too young for reigne, Wherefore his brother did the Crowne obtaine. Cassibelan, 17. yeeres. 58. Lvd dead, the Nobles crown'd Cassibelan, In whose reigne here the Romanes conquest wan, Great Iulius Cæsar sailed out of France, And in this Land his Eagle did aduance. But Britaines bold scorn'd base at first to stoope, Twice Cæsar fled, before their warlike troope. The Ciuill warres, this Kingdome ouer-runnes, Betwixt Cassibelan, and Luds two Sonnes, Whilst they (vnnaturall) sought each others fall, The Romanes tooke aduantage, conquer'd all: Where Cæsar, by his high Imperiall doome, Made Britaine Tributary vnto Rome. Theomantius, 37. Then Theomantius (of the royall blood) The sole Sonne liuing of his Father Lud: Reign'd three and twenty yeeres, a King in State, Whose Picture stands on Luds vnlucky gate. Cimbilinus. In this Kings reigne, (the glorious King of Kings In person came, and mans saluation brings) When through the world all bloody wars did cease, (For our soules peace) then came the Prince of peace. Guiderius, anno Christi, 21. This King and Subiects, brauely, nobly ioyne, To hold from Rome the tributary Coyne: But Claudius Cæsar with an Army came, The Britaines bold rebellious hearts to tame; One Hamon there (a Romane) did deuise, Him selfe like to a Britaine to disguise, Guiderius brauely chasde his foes amaine, Was by disguised Hamon falsely slaine. Aruiragus, 44. Stout Aruiragus being in the fight, The Kings death added fury to his might: Perceiu'd the Britaine Host, almost dismaide, In's brothers Armour hee himselfe array'd, The Souldiers thought the King againe suruiu'd, With courage new through euery veine deriu'd, Braue Aruiragus, like a Tempest goes, And pell mell topsieturuy throwes his foes. Great Cæsar with his Romane army fled, The King tooke Hamon, and cut off his head, And more, with sharp reuenge his wrath t'appease, Hew'd him piece-meale, and cast him in the Seas, The place long time, this name did then allow, Of Hamors hauen, or Southampton now. The Emperour would quite the tribute free, If Brittaines King his Sonne in law would be. Then Aruarigue did faire Genisse marry, And Claudius Cæsar heere a while did tarry, He builded Gloster, whil'st he heere remain'd: The King dyed hauing twenty eight yeeres reign'd. Marius, 73. In this Kings reigne the lawlesse proling Pict, (A Nation strange) did the North part afflict: But Marius, in a battell slew their King, And all their power did to subiection bring. The Picts from Scythia, into Scotland came, Rude, barbarous, ingratefull, hard to tame: For by the Scotsh Kings fauour hauing got Possession, they oft warr'd vpon the Scot. And more and more that Kingdome they annoy'd, Till Kennith Scotlands King, them all destroy'd: Yeeres fifty three reign'd Marius iust and wise, Dyed: and at Carleile his Corps royall lies. Coylus, 124. In Rome this King was fostred all his youth, He lou'd Peace, Iustice, Fortiude and Truth: He builded Colchester, and did suruiue, Till he had reign'd a Kings yeeres, fifty fiue. Lucius, 179. The first of Kings that was a Christian nam'd, Was Lucius (with the spirit of God inflam'd) The Bread of life he did receiue with ioy, The Pagan Idols hee did all destroy, The Flamines and Archflamines he downe cast, And Bishops and Archbishops here he plac'd, He lou'd and fear'd th'eternall Three in one, And dyed when he had 12. yeeres kept the Throne. Seuerus, 194. This was a Romane Emperour, and was slaine At York the eighteenth yeere of his proud reigne: Hee was an Alien and a stranger heere, And therefore bought his vsurpation deare. Bassianus, 212. Seuerus here did wed a Brittish Dame, By whom this King (their Son) the Crowne did claime. But after sixe yeeres time, he left this Land, And had the Romane Empire at's command. Carausius, 290. Alectus, 292. When Carausi' reigned, Dioclesian was Emperor. This King (of meane birth) did the Crown attain After seuen yeeres, was by Alectus slaine: Three yeeres Alectus did in state recide, Our Protomartyr then Saint Alban dyde. Asclepiodatus, 299. Asclepiodatus, (in a mortall Fight) Subdude the Romane Generall Gallus might; Kil'd him, and cast him head-long in a Brooke, Whence Gallus or Wallbrooke, for name it tooke, And as Alectus did Cardusius kill, So did this King Alectus life bloud spill, And after two yeeres reigne in mortall strife, Asclepiodatus slaine lost Crowne and life. Coil raigned 14. yeeres. 301. Colchesters Duke Coil in the Throne inuested, Was by Constantius Cæsar much molested: Till Coil gaue's Daughter to him for his Bride, And paid Romes tribute, that was long deuide. The Lady was of beauty most diuine, Faire Hellen, Mother to great Constantine. The King at Colchester, dead, laide in's Tombe, His Sonne Constantius did supply his roome. Constantius, 305. Spaine, Italy, France, Britaines Emperor, Foure yeeres he raign'd heere, with Maiesticke power, True Honour was the ayme at which he shot, Iust, Valiant, these reports his Actions got. Constantine, 306. Great Emp'ror Constantine, surnam'd the Great: In all respects a worthy Prince compleate, The glorious Gospell, he ador'd, and fear'd, Constantinople famously he rear'd, Maxentius, Romes great Tyrant, (most abhor'd) He made him flie from his Imperiall sword. Belou'd, bewail'd, high honor'd and admir'd, In grace with God and men, his dayes expir'd. 84. Constantinus, 337. 85. Constans, 340. These two were Brothers of the Royall line, And Sonnes vnto the Emperour Constantine: Ambition and debate for Kingly Raigne, Was the vnnaturall cause they both were slaine. 86. Octauius, 345. 87. Traherus, 349. Octauius Duke of Windsore tooke the Crowne, Traherus came from Rome and put him downe: The Land was full with hurly-burlies fild, Traherus by Octauius last was kild. 88. Constantius the third. 353. The Romane Empire he did closely sway, And as a King this Land did him obay: Th'Apostate Iulian was the Emp'rour next, By whom the Christians all were slaine, or vext. 89 Maximinianus. 375. Next Iulian, raigned Valentinian, And after him, succeeded Gratian: Maximianus was of life depriu'd, 'Cause he with Gratian for the Empire striu'd. 90. Gratian. 376. Then Gratian claim'd this Kingdome as his right: But hauing gain'd it, he was slaine in fight: Fierce warres the Romane Empire did deuide, And Cæsars and their Viceroyes fought and dyde. Honorius Romes Tribunall did obtaine, Next after him did Theodosius raigne, Then did the Scot ioyne with the barbarous Pict, This headlesse, Kinglesse Kingdome to afflict. The Romane Scepter we had long obayd, Foure hundred eighty three yeeres Tribute payd; And now this land shook off their wrongd c?mand When Ciuill discord had neer spoyl'd this Land. 91 Vortiger. 447. This King through murder did the Throne ascend, And had a troublous Raigne, and murdrous end: Constance (Constantines) lawfull Heyre and Sonne, By Vortigers false meanes to death was done. For which (to keepe the Crowne vniustly gain'd) The Saxons for his ayde he entertain'd. Then Hengist, with his Brother Horsus crue, In Britaines best bloud did their blades embrew. King Vortiger with doting loue inthral'd, Match't Hengists daughter, beauteous Rowan cal'd: But Saxons troopes, on troopes came in so fast, That Britaines did depriue the King at last. 92. Vortimer. 454. Then Vortimer, the Sonne of Vortiger, Vpon the Saxons made succesfull warre: Till he by Rowan was by craft o'r-tane, From whose false hands, he dy'd by poys'nous bane. Deposed Vortiger (his Sonne once slaine) His ill gain'd, ill kept Crowne he gain'd againe: Hengistus with his Saxon fresh supplies, The Plaines of Salisbury did all surprize. The King tooke counsell of his Brittaine Lords, And all in generall to a Peace accords. The Saxons and the Brittaines did agree, That at this meeting all vnarm'd should be: But traitrous Hengist did a watch-word speake, Which did the Law of Armes, and Honour breake, The Saxons vnsuspected drew forth Kniues, Foure hundred, threescore Lords, all lost their liues, All Brittaine Nobles, then the Saxons there, Surpris'd the King, constraining him through feare To giue Kent, Sussex, Suffolke, Norfolke, and That Hengist, King should in those Lands command, But after nineteene yeeres were quit expir'd, Reuenging Fire, the King in's Castle fir'd. And thus the Saxons, and Great Hengists Heyres, Won Shire to Shire, till Brittaine all was theirs. 93. Aurelius Ambrose. 466. In honour of the Nobles basely slaine, This King set vp the Stones on Sarum plaine: The Gospell with great zeale he dignifi'd, Raign'd thirty two yeeres, and by poyson dy'd. 94. Vter Pendragon raigned 18 yeeres. 498. This King (by Merlins meanes, a skilfull man) Igrene, the Duke of Cornewals Dutchesse wan: On her he got, (though illegittimate) The Christian Worthy, Arthur, stilde the Great. Yeeres after Christ. 95. Arthur. 516. Of the nine Worthies was this Worthy one, Denmarke, and Norway, did obey his Throne: In twelue set Battels he the Saxons beat, Great, and to make his Victories more great, The Faithlesse Sarazons he ouercame, And made them honour high Iehouah's Name. The Noble order of the Table round, At Winchester, his first inuention found. Whilst he beyond Sea fought to win Renowne, His Nephew Mordred did vsurpe his Crowne, But he return'd, and Mordred did confound, And in the fight great Arthur got a wound, That prou'd so mortall, that immortally It made him liue, although it made him dye. Full sixteene yeeres the Diadem he wore, And euery day gaind Honour more and more. 96 Constantine, the fourth. 542. 97 Aurelius Conanus. 545. Constantine was by King Aurelius kil'd: Aurelius (Brittaine) thirty three yeeres held, Seuen Kingdomes heere at once the Saxons held, And slaughter launc'd, when proud ambition sweld. 98 Uortiporus. 578. 99 Malgo. 581. This Uortipore from good Kings did decline, Kept his wiues Daughter as his Concubine: And Malgo put his Wife to bloudy slaughter, To liue in Incest with his brothers Daughter. 100. Careticus. 586. Gvrmundus hither out of Ireland came, And with the Saxons ioyn'd with sword and flame: The King to Wales did flye, his life to saue, Whereas he chang'd his Kingdome for a Graue. Cadwane. 613. This Cadwane did the Saxon force withstand, Of Ethelfridus of Northumberland: And made him to entreate and sue for peace: Raign'd two and twenty yeeres, then did decease. 102. Cadwallin. 635. Cadwallin slew King Edwin, Egfrids Sonne, He Penda Mercias King did ouer-runne: He neuer fought but Conquest home did bring, And eight and forty yeeres did raigne a King. 103. Cadwallader. 685. This King renowned was both neere and farre, The last of Brittaines Kings, Cadwallader, The name of Brittaine was quite alterd then, The Kings of England, subiects, Englishmen. Then in this Land, of Kings there raign'd so many, That Subiects knew not to obey all, or any: Their names and times of raigne I meane to tell, Should I write more, my Book too big would swell. These Kings following were of the West Saxons. 104. Athelstane reigned 15. yeeres. 905. This King did tame the Welsh, the Danes subdu'd, He conquered Scotland and the Marches rude: The Danish Gyant Colebrand in Hyde-meads, By Guy the Earle of Warwick was struck dead. 105. Edmund. 940. 106. Eldred. 640 Edmund, reign'd next his brother Athelstane, And after fiue yeeres was vntimely slaine: Nine yeeres was Eldred Englands King instil'd, Th'insulting Danes, he from this Realme exilde. 107. Edwin. 955. 108. Edgar. 959. Then Edwin (as his right) obtain'd the Crowne, For Rape, and brutish Lust he was put downe. His brother Edgar a man iust and wise, By Edwins fall, vnto the Throne did rise. The Church and Commoweale (long time deform'd) He by his Iustice and good Lawes reform'd. Raign'd sixteen yeeres, and then by death assail'd, As he had liu'd belou'd, he dy'd bewail'd. 109 Edward. 975. 110 Etheldred. 978. Edward was slain by his accurst Stepmother, Ayded by Etheldred his cruell brother. This Etheldred caus'd all the Danes be slaine: And dyed the thirty eightth yeere of his raigne. 111 Edmond Ironside. 1016. The Danes came to reuenge with sword and fire, Both Kings to Combat single did desire: On equall termes, their valours both were tride, In loue the Realme betwixt them they deuide. 112 Canutus. 1018. This mighty Danish King foure Kingdomes hold, Danes, Norway, England, Scotland he compeld, Taxes and toles he rais'd in England here, And dyed when he had gouern'd twenty yeere. 113 Harold. 1038. 114 Hardicanutus. 1041. Harold from England did exile his Mother, And kild Allured his King and his Brother: Hardianutus then the Crowne obtain'd, Who quaffing died, when he 3. yeeres had raign'd. 115. Saint Edward. 1043. 116. Harold the second. 1066. Saint Edward from the Danes this Kingdom freed, And for he had no Heyre, he heere decreed, That William Duke of Normandy should be Next King, but Harold seeming to agree, Assoone as Edward was laid in his Toombe, This hasty Harold mounted in his roome, But William came from Normandy amaine, By whom King Harold was vnking'd and slaine. The end of the first part. The second part. William Conquerour. An. Dom. 1066. VVhen Britains, Romanes, Saxons, Danes had done, The Normans (fiftly) Englands glory won, New Lords brought in new Lawes incontinent, And all were Conquer'd but the County Kent. King William (after he had all surpriz'd) Insulted, domineer'd, and tyranniz'd, All Englishmen (like slaues) their doores must lock, On paine of death, each night at eight of clocke. The English from all Office were disgrac'd, And in their places the proud French were plac'd. Stil beating down the right, with wrong on wrong, Disdaining men should speake the English tongue. And so to bring our memory to naught, The Grammar and the Lawes in French were taught. King Swanus Sonnes, with Danes a mighty band, Arriu'd in Humber to inuade the Land, Then Yorke was burnt, the wealth away was borne, And Danes on Composition home did turne. A dearth in England was so great, that heere Cats, Dogs, and mans flesh, was our wofull cheere. The Mercians and Northumbers they rebel'd, Strong warres the Scots within our Country held: The Ile of Fly did the King surprize, He caus'd the Rebels lose hands, feet, and eyes. The Normans did rebell and were subdu'd, Danes came and fled, with all their multitude. The Kings sonne (Robert) by the French Kings ayd, Did diuers parts of Normandy inuade. The Scots spoild England, with all might and maine, And Durhams Bishop in a broyle was slaine, Heere euery Acre of mens Lands were measur'd. And by a heauy taxe the King was treasur'd: Slaine by a Deere the Kings sonne lost his life, And Glassenbury Monkes were kill'd in strife. The English Nobles almost were decay'd, And euery place of rule the Normans swai'd. And all mens goods and lands, and coyn were rated Through England, and vnto the King related. The French mens pride did England ouerwhelme, And grieuous tributes did oppresse the Realme. Churches and Chappels were throwne down with speed, To make New Forrest as the King decreed: Who hauing rul'd in trouble, toyle and care, And tryannously pol'd this Kingdome bare, Neere twenty one yeeres, death was then his bane: He lyes in Normandy, enterr'd at Caue. William Rufus. An. Dom. 1087. William the cruell Conquerours second Sonne, With ease, got what his Fathers paines had won, Oppressed England he opprest and prest, And great Exactions wrongfully did wrest. For Symony, and base corrupting gold, The King most Churches and Church-liuings sold, And more, (his Subiects vilely to abuse) Against them he in armes did arme the Iewes, And swore if they the victory did gaine, That he their faithlesse faith would entertaine. Vpon his eldest brother hee raysd warres, His youngest brother troubled him with iarres. At London, such a furious winde did blow, Which did sixe hundred houses ouerthrow. The City Gloster was by Welshmen sack'd. Northumberland was by King William wrack'd: William de Oue, and William de Aluery. In cruell torments dyed at Salisbury. Duke Robert laid all Normandy to gage Vnto the King, warres with the Turkes to wage. Westminster Hall was built, the Danes came in, And th'Orchades, and the Ile of Man did win, But as the King was hunting in Hampshire, Sir Walter Tirrill shooting at a Deere, The Arrow glauncing 'gainst a Tree by chance, Th'vnhappy King kild, by the haplesse Glaunce. A Colliers Cart to Winchester did bring The Corps, where vnbemoand they laid the King. Henry the first. An. Dom. 1100. This Henry (for his wisedome Beuclarke nam'd) Th'vnlawfull Lawes and measures he reclaim'd. The Norman Duke, eld'st Brother to the King, To claime the Crowne a mighty Hoast did bring. Saint Bartholomewes was founded and Saint Gyles, And Henry stop'd Duke Roberts mouth with wiles. Then peace was made; but after, warres did rise, The King tooke's brother, and put out his eyes. Here Windsor Church and Castle were erected, And Wales (rebeld) most sharpely was corrected. All the King's Sonnes and eight score persons more, Were drown'd by tempest neere the Norman shore. Thus all his Ioy in Childrens losse bereft, Saue onely Maud, the Widdow Empresse left, Whom Geffrey Anioy's Earle to wife did get, From whom did spring the name Plantagenet. The King proclaim'd his Daughter, or her seede, After his death should in the Realme succeede, And after thirty fiue yeeres time was past, King Henry by a surfet breath'd his last. Much trouble in his dayes this Kingdome wearied, He dyed, and dead, at Redding he lies buried. Thus God that lifts the low, casts downe the high, Caus'd all the Conquerors sonnes vntimely dye. King Stephen. An. Dom. 1135. Stephen Earle of Boloign, (th'Earle of Bloys his son) From th'Empresse Maud this famous Kingdome won. Domesticke, forraigne, dangerous discords, 'Twixt factions factions, of the King and's Lords, Wars 'twixt the King and th'Empresse for the crown, Both tasted Fortunes fauours, and her frowne, Now vp, now downe, like balles at Tennis tost, Till Stephen gain'd the goale, and th'Empresse lost. And after eighteene yeeres were come and gone, The King not hauing any lawfull Sonne, He dyed, and chang'd his Kingdome &amp; his strength, For a small Sepulcher of sixe foote length. Henry the second. An Dom. 1154. This King vnto the Empresse Maud was Heyre, And lawfully obtain'd the Regall Chayre, He was couragious, and yet most vnchaste, Which Vice, his other Vertues all defac'd. He lou'd faire Rosamond, the worlds faire Rose, For which his wife and children turn'd his foes. He made his sonne Copartner in his Crowne, Who rais'd strong warres to put his Father downe. Faire Rosamond at Woodstock by the Queene Was poyson'd, in reuengefull iealous spleene. In toyle, and trouble, with his Sonnes and Peeres, The King raign'd almost fiue and thirty yeeres. Hee neere his death did curse his day of birth, Hee curst his Sonnes, and sadly left the earth, Hee at Founteuerard in his Tombe was laid, And his Son Richard next the Scepter swaid. Richard Cordelion. An. Dom. 1189. This braue victorious Lyon-hearted Prince, The foes of Christ, in Iury did conuince: Whilst at Ierusalem he wan Renowne, His Brother Iohn at home vsurp'd his Crowne. And as he home return'd, (his owne to gaine) By Austria's Duke, the King was Prisoner tane. His ransome was an hundred thousand pound, Which paid, in England he againe was crown'd. Yet after nine full yeeres, and 9. months raigne, Hee with a Shot was kild in Aquitane, His buriall at Founteuerard was thought meet, At his dead Fathers, second Henries feet. King Iohn. An. Dom. 1199. John Earle of Morton tooke the regall Seate, His state, his toyle, his pompe, his cares, all great: The French, the Welsh, the Scotsh, all prou'd his foes, The Pope King Iohn did from his Crowne depose. His Lords rebel'd, from France the Dolphin came, And wasted England much with sword and flame. And after seuenteene yeeres were full expir'd, King Iohn being poysoned, to his graue retir'd. Henry the third. An. Dom. 1216. Wars, bloody wars, the French in England made, Strong holds, Towns, Towres &amp; Castles they inuade. But afterwards it was K. Henries chance, By force perforce to force them backe to France. Great discord 'twixt the King and Barons were, And factions did the Realme in pieces teare. A world of mischiefes did this Land abide, And fifty sixe yeeres raign'd the King and dy'd. Edward Long-shanks. An. Dom. 1272. This was a hardy, wise, Victorious King, The Welshmen he did to subiection bring: He Scotland wan, and brought from thence (by fate) Their Crowne, their Scepter, Chaire, and Cloth of state, That Kingdome with oppression sore he brusde, Much tyranny and bloodshed there he vsde. When thirty fiue yeeres he the Crowne had kept, At Westminster, he with his Father slept. Edward of Carnaruan. An. Dom. 1307. The hard mis-haps that did this King attend, The wretched life, and lamentable end, Which he endur'd the like hath ne'r bin seene, Depos'd, and poyson'd by his cruell Queene. Which when the poyson had no force to kill, Another way she wrought her wicked will. Into his Fundament a red hot Spit Was thrust, which made his Royall heart to split. Edward the third. An. Dom. 1326. In Peace, and warre, this King was right, &amp; good, He did reuenge his murdred Fathers blood: Hee, and the blacke Prince, his most valiant Sonne, The Field at Cressie, and at Poytiers wonne, At first and last in his victorious raigne, Of French and Scots, were six score thousand slaine. And more, (his glory further to aduance) He tooke the Kings of Scotland and of France. The noble order of the Garter, he At Windsor, instituted caus'd to be. When fifty yeeres this Land had him obaid, At Westminster he in his tombe was laid. Richard the second. An. Dom. 1377. Yong King, rash co?sell, lawes &amp; right neglected, The good put downe, the bad in State erected: The Court with knaues &amp; flat'rers here did swarm, The Kingdome, (like a Farme) was let to Farme. The Commons rose in Armies, Routes, and throngs, And by foule treason, would redresse foule wrongs. In this Kings raigne, began the Ciuill warre, (Vnnaturally) 'twixt Yorke and Lancaster. Oppression on oppression, breedes Confusion, Bad Prologue, bad Proceeding, bad Conclusion: King Richard, twenty two yeeres raign'd, misse-led, Deposed and at Pomfret knock'd ith'head. Henry the fourth. An. Dom. 1399. The Crown wrong got fr? the wrong doing king, More griefe then ioy did to King Henry bring: France, England, Scotland, Wales, arose in Armes, And menac'd Henry, with most fierce Alarmes: Hot Percy, Dowglas, Mortimer, Glendowre, At Shrewsbury, the King orethrew their power, He fourteene yeeres did raigne, and then did dye, At Canterbury buried, he doth lye. Henry the fift. An. Dom. 1412. This was a King Renowned neere and farre, A Mars of men, a Thunderbolt of warre: At Agencourt the French were ouerthrowne, And Henry heyre proclaim'd vnto that Crowne. In nine yeeres raigne this valiant Prince wan more, Then all the Kings did after or before. Intomb'd at Westminster his Carkas lyes, His soule did (like his Acts) ascend the skies. Henry the sixt. An. Dom. 1422. This Infant Prince scarce being nine moneths old, The Realmes of France and England he did hold: But he vncapable through want of yeeres, Was ouer-gouern'd by mis-gouern'd Peeres. Now Yorke and Lancaster, with bloudy wars, Both wound this kingdome, with deep deadly scars. Whilst this good King by Yorke oppos'd, depos'd, Expos'd to dangers, is captiu'd, inclos'd, His Queene exilde, his sonne and many friends, Fled, murdred, slaughtred; lastly, Fate contends To crowne him once againe, who then at last Was murdred, thirty nine yeeres being past. Edward the fourth. An. Dom. 1460. Edward, the 4. the house of Yorks great heire, By bloudy wars attain'd the Regall Chaire, The poore King Henry into Scotland fled, And foure yeeres there was royally cloath'd and fed, Still good successe with him was in the wane, He by King Edwards power at last was tane. But yet before the tenth yeere of his reigne, Hence Edward fled, and Henry crown'd againe. By Warwicks meanes sixe moneths he held the same: Till Edward backe in armes to England came, And fighting stoutly, made this kingdome yeeld, And slew great Warwicks Earle at Barnet field. Thus Ciuill wars on wars, and broyles on broyles, And England against England spils and spoyles, Now Yorke, then Lancaster, then Yorke againe, Quels Lancaster; thus ioy, griefe, pleasure, paine, Doth like inconstant waters ebbe and flow: Ones rising is the others ouerthrow. King Edward, twenty two yeeres rul'd this Land, And lies at Windsor where his Tombe doth stand. Edward the fifth. An. Dom. 1483. High birth, blood, state, and innocent in yeeres, Eclips'd, and murdred by insulting Peeres: This King was neuer crown'd, short was his raigne: For to be short, hee in short space was slaine. Richard the third. An. Dom. 1483. By Treason, mischiefe, murder and debate. Vsurping Richard wonne the royall state: Vnnaturally the children of his brother The King, and Duke of Yorke he caus'd to smother. For Sir Iames Tirrell, Dichton and Blacke Will, Did in the Tower these harmlesse Princes kill, Buckinghams Duke did raise King Richard high, And for reward he lost his head thereby. A fellow to this King I scarce can finde, His shape deform'd, and crooked like his minde. Most cruell, tyrannous, inconstant, stout, Couragious, hardy, t'abide all dangers out, Yet when his sinnes were mellow, ripe and full, Th'Almighties Iustice then his plumes did pull: By bloudy meanes he did the kingdome gaine, And lost it so, at Bosworth being slaine. Henry the seuenth. An. Dom. 1485. VVhen Ciuill wars, full fourescore yeers &amp; more, Had made this kingdome welter in her Gore: When eightie of the royall blood were kild, That Yorke and Lancasters crosse faction held, Then God in mercy, looking on this Land, Brought in this Prince, with a triumphant band, The onely Heire of the Lancastrian line, Who graciously consented to combine, To ease poore England of a world of mone, And make the red Rose and the white but one, By Marriage with Elizabeth the faire, Fourth Edwards daughter, and Yorks onely heire. But Margret Burgunds dutches storm'd &amp; frown'd, That th'heire of Lancaster in state was crown'd. A counterfeit, one Lambert she suborn'd, (Being with Princely ornaments adorn'd) To claime the State in name of Clarence sonne, Who in the Tower before to death was done. Wars 'gainst the French King Henry did maintaine, And Edward braue Lord Wooduile there was slaine. Northumberlands great Earle (for the Kings right) Was slaine by Northerne rebels in sharpe fight. The King besiedged Boloigne, but a Peace The French King sought, and so the siedge did cease. Still Burgunds Dutchesse, (with inueterate hate) Did seeke to ruine Henries Royall state: She caus'd one Perkin Warbecke, to put on The name of Richard, Edwards murdred sonne, Which Richard, was the youngest of the twaine Of Edwards sonnes that in the Tower was slaine. The King at last these traitors did confound, And Perkin for a counterfeit was found. Sir William Stanley, (once the Kings best friend) At Tower hill, on a Scaffold had his end. On Blacke Heath Coruish rebels were o'rthrowne, A Shoomaker did claime King Henries Crowne. The Earle of Warwicke lost his haplesse head, And Lady Katherine did Prince Arthur wed. But ere sixe moneths were fully gone and past, In Ludlow Castle, Arthur breath'd his last. King Henry built his Chappell from the ground, At Westminster, whose like can scarce be found. Faire Margret eldest daughter to our King, King Iames the fourth of Scotland home did bring, Where those two Princes, with great pompe and cheare, In State at Edenborough married were. But as all Mortall things are transitory, So to an end came Henries earthly glory. Twenty three yeeres, and 8. months here he swaid, And then at Westminster, in's Tombe was laid. He all his Life had variable share, Of Peace, Warre, Ioy, Griefe, Royaltie and Care. Henry the eight. An. Dom. 1509. From both the Lines, and both the Ioynes (did spring) Of York &amp; Lancaster, this mighty King: Katherine that was his brothers wife of late, He tooke to wife, and crown'd her Queene in state. Empson and Dudley lost their heads at Tower, For racking the poore Commons by their power. Warres, dreadfull wars, arose 'twixt vs and France, Lord Edward Howard, drowned by mis-chance At Brest, he was high Admirall in fight, Cast ouerboord, dy'd like a valiant Knight. In England Suffolks Duke did lose his head, The King to Turwin did an army lead, Turney he wonne with his victorious blade, King Iames of Scotland, England did inuade: But Surries Earle, the Scotsh King ouercame, Who lost life there, but wonne immortall fame. Now Cardinall Wolsey, in the Kings high Grace, Was rais'd to honours, from great place to place, Lordship on Lordship laid vpon his backe, Vntill the burthen was the bearers wracke. The Duke of Buckingham, his head did lose, And Luther stoutly did the Pope oppose, Blinde ignorance that long had look'd awry, Began to see Truth with a clearer eye, And then the King (inspir'd with feruent Zeale) Reformed both the Church and Common weale, Iehouah with his power Omnipotent, Did make this King his gracious Instrument, T'vnmaske his Truth from Antichristian fables, And purge this wofull Land from Babels bables. This King at Boloigne was victorious; In peace and warre, Magnifique, Glorious; In his rage bounty he did oft expresse, His Liberality to bee excesse, In Reuels, Iusts, and Turnies he spent more, Then fiue of his Fore-fathers did before, His Auarice was all for Noble fame, Amongst the Worthies to inrole his Name, A valiant Champion for the Faiths defence, Was the great Title of this mightie Prince. Sixe wiues he had, 3 Kates, 2. Annes, one Iaue, Two were diuorc'd, two at the blocke were slaine: One sonne and two faire daughters he did leaue, Who each from other did the Crowne receiue: The first was Edward; Mary next, whose death Left State, and Realme, to Queene Elizabeth. He thirty eight yeeres kept this Royall Roome, At Windsor hee's enter'd without a Tombe. Edward the sixt. An. Dom. 1546. Had this Kings reigne bin long, as it was good, Religion in a peaceable state had stood, What might haue his age bin, when his blest youth, So valiantly aduanc'd Gods sacred truth? At nine yeeres age, the Crowne on him hee tooke, And ere sixteene, he Crowne and life forsooke. Too good for earth, th'Almighty tooke his spirit, And Westminster his Carkas doth inherit. Queene Mary. An. Dom. 1553. After a while this Queene had worne the Crown, Idolatry was rais'd, and Truth put downe, The Masse, the Images, the Beades and Altars, By tyrannie, by fire, and sword and Halters, Th'vngodly bloudy Antichristian sway, Men were force, perforce forced to obey. Now burning Bonner, Londons Bishop, he Was from the Marshal-sea againe set free: Iohn Dudley, great Duke of Northumberland, And Sir Iohn Gates dyed by the Headsmans hand, With them Sir Thomas Palmer likewise dy'd, Hoping for heau'n, through Iesus Crucified. In Latine Seruice must be sung and said, Because men should not know for what they prai'd. The Emp'rors sonne, great Philip King of Spaine A marriage with Queene Mary did obtaine: Against which match, Sir Thomas Wyat rose, With powers of Kent the Spaniards to oppose. But Wyat was or'throwne, his armie fled, And on the Tower hill after lost his head. Lord Gray the Duke of Suffolke also dy'd, An Axe his Corps did from his head diuide, A little after, the Lord Thomas Gray, The Dukes owne brother went that headlesse way. A Millers sonne assum'd King Edwards name, And falsely in that name the Crowne did claime, But he was tane and iustly whip'd and tortur'd, And claiming it once more, was hang'd &amp; quarterd. King Philip won Saint Quintins with great cost. But after to our shame was Callice lost, Callice was lost, which threescore yeeres and ten, Had beene a Garrison for Englishmen. Thus by Gods mercy Englands Queene did dye, And England gain'd much ease and rest thereby. Fiue yeeres and 4. months was her bloudy reigne, And all her glory doth one graue contame. Though of her selfe this Queene was well inclin'd, Bad-minded counsell altred much her minde. Queene Elizabeth. An. Dom. 1558. A Debora, a Iudith, a Susanna, A Virgin, a Virago, a Diana: Couragious, Zealous, Learned, Wise and Chaste, With heauenly, earthly gifts, adorn'd and grac'd, Victorious, glorious, bountious, gracious, good, And one, whose vertues dignifi'd her bloud, That Muses, Graces, Armes, and liberall Arts, Amongst all Queens, proclaim'd her Queen of hearts, She did repurifie this Land once more, From the infection of the Romish whore. Now Abbies, Abbots, Fri'rs, Monks, Nuns &amp; Stews, Masses, and Masse-priests, that mens soules abuse, Were all cast downe, Lamps, Tapers, Relikes, Beads, And Superstitions that mans soule misse-leads, All Popish pardons, Buls, Confessions, With Crossings, Cristening bels, Saints, Intercessions, The Altars, Idols, Images downe cast, All Pilgrimage, and Superstitious Fast, Th'acknowledging the Pope for supreme head, The holy water, and the god of bread, The mumbling Mattins, and the pickpurse Masse, These bables this good Queene did turne to grasse. She caus'd Gods seruice to be said and sung, In our owne vnderstanding English tongue. In Scotland and in France, fierce warres she held, The Irish she subdu'd when they rebeld, The Netherlands her name doe still admire, And Spaine her like againe doth not desire. When forty foure yeers reigne was past and gone, She chang'd her earthly for a heauenly Throne, At Greenwich she was borne, at Richmond dy'd, At Westminster she buried doth abide; And as the fame of this Imperiall Maide, Is through the world, (by the foure winds) displaid, So shall her memory for euer grace Her famous birth, her death, and buriall place. King Iames. An. Dom. 1602. VVhen as Elizaes wofull death was acted: When this lamenting land was halfe distracted: Wh? tears each loyall heart with grief had drownd, Then came this King and made our ioyes abound, Ordain'd for vs by heauenly power diuine, Then from the North this glorious starre did shine, The Roall Image of the Prince of Peace, The blest Concorder that made warres to cease; By Name a Stevvard, and by Nature one, Appointed from Iehouahs sacred Throne, And by th'almighties hand supported euer, That Treason or the Diuell should hurt him neuer: And as his Zeale vnto his God was great, Gods blessings on him were each way compleat, Rich in his Subiects loue (a Kings best treasure) Rich in content, (a Riches aboue measure) Rich in his Princely Issue, and in them, Rich in his hopefull Branches of his stemme; Rich in Munition, and a Nauy Royall, And richer then all Kings in seruants Loyall. When Hell and Rome together did conspire, To blow him and his kingdome vp with fire, Then did the King of Kings preserue our King, And all the Traytors to confusion bring. And who so reckons vp from first to last, The many hel-hatch'd dangers he hath past Through all his daies, he will beleeue (no doubt) That he with heauenly pow'rs was wall'd about. All Christian Princes held his friendship deare, Was fear'd for loue, and not belou'd for feare: And Pagan Monarchs were in League combin'd With him, as farre as is the Easterne Iude. And like a flame amidst a Riuer fix'd, So was his Iustice with his mercy mix'd: He striu'd to imitate his Maker still, And clemency preseru'd where Law would kill. He hath cur'd England, and heal'd Scotlands wounds, And made them both great (anci?t) Britains bounds: All bloudy deadly feuds he caus'd surcease, And canker'd hate he turn'd to Christian peace, The mouth of warre he muzzled mute and dum, He still'd the roaring Cannon and the Drum: Secure in peace, his people sup and dine, With their owne fig-trees shaded and their vine, Whilst in an vprore most of Christendome, One Nation doth another ouercome. Vnto the King of Kings let's praises sing. For giuing vs this happy peacefull King. None know so well how they should peace prefer, As those that know the miseries of warre: Tis true (though old) and must not be forgot, The warres are sweet to such as know them not. Peace (happy peace) doth spread tranquillity, Through all the bounds of Britaines Monarchy; And may we all actions still addresse, For peace with God, and warre 'gainst wickednesse. Vnto which peace of God this King's ascended, To reigne in glory that shall ne'r be ended. His mortall part at Westminster enter'd, His soule and Fame immortally prefer'd. King Charles. Two Williams, Henries 8. 1. Steuen, 1. Iohn, Sixe Edwards, Richards 3. and 1. Queene Mary: Elizabeth, and Iames, all dead and gone, Our gracious Charles doth now the Scepter carry; And may they liue and dye of God accurst, Who wish the preiudice of Charles the first. A BRIEFE REMEMBRANCE OF ALL THE ENGLISH MONARCHS, from the Normans Conquest, vntill this present. TO THE HONOVRABLE AND TRVLY Noble, Sir Robert Carr, Knight, one of the Gentlemen of his Maiesties Royall Bed-chamber, &amp;c. Tis not in expectation of reward, That I this booke vnto your hands doe tender; But in my humble dutie, in regard That I am bound my daily thanks to render. And though my stile be harsh, my learning slender, My Uerse defectiue, and my Accent rude; Yet if your Patronage be my Defender, J am defended 'gainst a multitude. Thus (to auoyd Hell-hatch'd ingratitude, My dutious Loue) my Lines, and Life shall be, To you deuoted euer to conclude, May you and your most vertuous Ladie see Long happie dayes, in Honour still encreasing; And after death, true Glorie neuer ceasing. Your Honours in all seruice, Iohn Taylor. WILLIAM THE FIRST, Surnamed the Conqverovr; KING OF England, And DVKE OF NORMANDY. By bloody Battels, Conquest, and by Fate, Faire Englands Crown &amp; Kingdome I surpris'd: I topsie-turuy turn'd the English State, And Lawes and Customes new and strange deuis'd. And where I vanquisht, there I tyranniz'd, In stead of peoples loue inforcing feare: Extorting Tolls I daily exercis'd, And Tributes, greater then the Land could beare, Besides, (the Normans fame the more to reare) The English I forbad the English tongue, French Schooles of Grammer I ordayned here, And 'gainst this Nation added wrong to wrong. At last my Crown, Sword, Scepter, C?quest braue I left, I lost, scarce found an earthly Graue. WILLIAM THE IJ, Surnamed Rvfvs, KING OF England, And DVKE OF NORMANDY. VVhat my triumphant Father wan, I held, I pill'd &amp; poll'd this Kingdom more then he, Great Tributes from my people I compeld: No place in Church or Common-wealth was free, But alwaies those that would giue most to me, Obtain'd their purpose being wrong or right. The Clergy I enforced to agree, To sell Church-plate and Chalices out-right. Vntill at last (by the Almighties might) My Kingly power and force was forcelesse made, My glorious pompe that seem'd t'eclips mens sight, Did vanish by a glance, by chance, and fade: For hunting in new-forrest (voyd of feare) A Subiect slew me shooting at a Deere. HENRY THE FIRST, Surnamed Beavclarke, KING OF England And DVKE OF NORMANDY. My Father and my Brother Kings, both gone, With acclamations Royall I was crown'd: And hauing gain'd the Scepter and the Throne, I with the name of Beauclarke was renown'd: The English Lawes long lost, I did refound, False waights and measures I corrected true, The power of Wales in fight I did confound, And Normandy my valour did subdue. Yet I vnmindfull whence these glories grew, My eldest Brother Robert did surprise, Detain'd him, and vsurp'd his Royall due, And most vnnat'rally pluckt out his eyes, Kings liue like Gods, but yet like men they dye, All must pay Natures due, and so did I. STEPHEN, KING OF England, And DVKE OF NORMANDY By wrested Titles and vsurping claime, Thrugh storms &amp; tempests of tumultuous wars, The Crowne (my fairest marke and foulest ayme) I wonne and wore, beleaguerd round with iars. The English, Scots and Normæns all prepares Their powers, exposing to oppose my powers, Whilst this Land laden and o'rwhelm'd with cares, Endures, whilst war, wo, want and death deuoures. But as yeers, months, weeks, days decline by houres, Houres into minutes, minutes into nought: My painfull pompe decai'd like fading flowres, And vnto nought was my Ambition brought. Thus is the state of transitory things: Ther's nothing can be permanent with Kings. HENRY THE SECOND, KING OF England, DVKE OF NORMANDY, Guyen and Aquitaine, &amp;c. To th'Empresse Maud I was vndoubted Heyre, And in her Right, my Title being iust, By iustice I obtain'd the Regall Chayre. Fayre Rosamond I soyled with foule lust, For which Heauens Iustice (hating deeds vniust) Stir'd vp my Wife and Sonnes to be my foes: Who sought to lay my Glory in the dust, And hem'd me round with cruell warres and woes. They poys'ned my sweete beautious tainted Rose, By Isabels deuice my furious Queene: My very bowels 'gainst me did oppose: Such fruit hath lust, such force hath iealous spleene. My cursed crosses made me curse my birth, With her I liu'd, raign'd, died, and turn'd to earth. RICHARD THE FIRST, Surnamed Cver De Lyon, KING OF ENGLAND, DVKE OF NORMANDY, Guyen and Aquitaine, &amp;c. Through my Creators mercy and his might, Ierusalem I conquer'd and set free, False mis-beleeuing Iewes, and Turkish spight, From Iury force perforce I forc'd to flee. The Realme of Cypresse was subdude by me. Sicilia trembled at my prowesse bold. King Tancred bought his peace, and did agree, And paid me threescore ounces of fine gold: Whilst I abroad won Honour manifold, Aspiring Iohn (my brother) vext my Realme. In Austria I was tane, and laid in hold: Thus floods of griefe each way me ouer-whelme. At last I home return'd, my ransome paid, My earthly glory in a Graue was laid. IOHN, KING OF ENGLAND, DVKE OF NORMANDY, Guyen and Aquitaine, LORD OF IRELAND, &amp;c. Romes mighty miter'd Metropolitan I did oppose, and was by him depos'd: He turn'd his cursed blessings to his ban, And caus'd me round to be with cares inclos'd, The English and the Normans me oppos'd, And Lewis of France my Kingdome did molest, Whilst I to all these miseries expos'd, Consum'd my Kingly dayes in restlesse rest. At last the Pope was pleas'd, and I reblest: Peace was obtain'd, proclaim'd, I re-inthroan'd. Thus was my raigne with woes opprest and prest, Blest, curst, friends, foes, diuided and aton'd. And after seuenteene yeeres were gone and past, At Swinsted poys'ned, there I dranke my last. HENRY THE THIRD, KING OF ENGLAND, Lord Of Jreland, DVKE OF NORMANDY, Guyen and Aquitaine, &amp;c. In toyle and trouble midst contentions broyles, I seiz'd the Scepter of this famous Land, Then being greatly wasted with the spoyles Which Lewis had made with his French furious band: But I with Peeres and people brauely mand, Repeld, repulst, expulst insulting foes. My Barons did my Soueraignty withstand, And wrapt themselues and me in warres and woes: But in each Battell none but I did lose, I lost my Subiects liues on euery side: (From Ciuill warres no better gaining growes) Friends, foes, my people all, that fought or died. My gaines was losse, my pleasure was my paine, These were the triumphs of my troublous raigne. EDVVARD THE FIRST, KING OF ENGLAND, Lord Of Ireland, DVKE OF AQVITAINE, &amp;c. My Victories, my Valour, and my strength, My actions, and my neuer-conquer'd name, Were spred throughout the world in bredth &amp; l?gth By mortall deeds, I want immortall Fame. Rebellious Wales I finally did tame, And made them Vassalls to my princely Sonne: I entred Scotland fierce with Sword and Flame, And almost all that Kingdome ouer-run. Still where I fought, triumphantly I won, Through Blood and Death my glory I obtain'd: But in the end, when all my Acts were done, A Sepulcher was all the gaine I gain'd. For though great Kings contend for earthly sway, Death binds them to the peace and parts the fray. EDWARD THE IJ, KING OF ENGLAND, Lord Of Ireland, DVKE OF AQVITAINE, &amp;c. Soone after was my fathers corps inter'd, Whilst Fate and Fortune did on me attend: And to the Royall Throne I was prefer'd, With Aue Ceaser, euery knee did bend, But all these fickle ioyes did fading end, Peirce Gaueston to thee my loue combind: My friendship to thee scarce left me a friend, But made my Queene, Peeres, People, all vnkind, I tortur'd, both in body and in mind, Was vanquisht by the Scots at Bannocks Bourne, And I enforc'd by flight some safety find, Yet taken by my Wife at my returne, A red-hot Spit my Bowels through did gore, Such misery, no slaue endured more. EDWARD THE IIJ, KING OF ENGLAND, And FRANCE, Lord Of Ireland In Peace and War, my Stars auspicious stood, False Fortune stedfast held her wauering wheele; I did reuenge my Fathers butcher'd blood, I forced France my furious force to feele: I warr'd on Scotland with triumphing Steele, Afflicting them with slaughtering Sword and Fire: That Kingdome then diuided needs must reele: Betwixt the Bruces and the Balliols ire: Thus daily still my glory mounted higher, With black Prince Edward my victorious Sonne, Vnto the top of honour wee aspire, By manly Princely, worthy actions done. But all my Triumphs, fortunes, strength and force, Age brought to death, &amp; death turn'd to a Coarse. RICHARD THE IJ, KING OF ENGLAND, And France, LORD OF IRELAND, &amp;c. A Sunshine Morne, precedes a showry day, A Calme at Sea ofttimes foreruns a storme: All is not gold that seemes so glistring gay; Foule Vice is fairest features Canker-worme, So I that was of blood, descent and forme, The perfect jmage of a Royall Stock, Vnseason'd young aduice did me deforme, Split all my hopes against despaires blacke rock, My Regall name and power was made a mock, My Subiects madly in rebellion rose, Mischiefe on mischiefe all in troopes did flock, Oppos'd, depos'd, expos'd, inclos'd in woes, With wauering fortunes troublously I raign'd, Slaine by foule murther, peace and rest I gain'd. HENRY THE IV, KING OF England, And FRANCE, LORD OF IRELAND, &amp;c. From right (wrong-doing) Richard I did wrest His Crowne mis-guided, but on me mis-plac'd: Vnciuill Ciuill warres my Realme molest, And English men did England spoyle and wast, The Sire, the Son, the Son the Father chas'd, Vndutifull, vnkind, vnnaturall, Both Yorke and Lancaster were rais'd and rac'd, As Conquest did to either Faction fall. But still I grip'd the Scepter and the Ball, And what by wrong I won, by might I wore: For Prince of Wales I did my Son install, But as my Martiall Fame grew more and more, By fatall Fate my vitall threed was cut: And all my Greatnesse in a graue was put. HENRY THE FIFTH, KING OF ENGLAND, And France, LORD OF IRELAND. From my Lancastrian Sire successiuely, I Englands glorious golden Garland got: I temper'd Iustice with mild clemency, Much blood I shed, yet blood-shed loued not, Time my Sepulchre and my bones may rot, But Time can neuer end my endlesse fame. Obliuion cannot my braue acts out blot, Or make Forgetfulnesse forget my name. I plaid all France at Tennise such a game, With roaring Rackets, bandied Balls and Foyles: And what I plaid for, still I won the same, Triumphantly transporting home the spoyles. But in the end grim death my life assail'd, And as I liu'd, I dy'd, belou'd, bewail'd. HENRY THE VI, KING OF ENGLAND, And France, Lord Of Jreland. Great England Mars (my Father being dead) I, not of yeares, or yeare; but eight months old: The Diadem was plac't vpon my head, In Royall Robes the Scepter I did hold: But as th'Almighties workes are manifold, Too high for mans conceit to comprehend: In his eternall Register enrold My Birth, my troublous Life, and tragicke End. 'Gainst me the house of Yorke their force did bend, And Peeres and People weltred in their gore: My Crown and Kingdome they from me did rend, Which I, my Sire, and Grandsire kept and wore. Twice was I crown'd vncrown'd, oft blest, oft crost, And lastly, murdred, life and Kingdome lost. EDWARD THE IIIJ, KING OF ENGLAND, And France, LORD OF IRELAND, &amp;c. I Yorkes great heire (by fell domesticke Warre) Inthroaned was, vn-King'd, and re-inthroan'd: Subiecting quite the house of Lancaster, Whilst wofull England ouer-burthen'd, groan'd: Old Sonlesse Sires, and Childlesse Mothers moan'd, These bloody broyles had lasted threescore years, And till the time we were in peace attoan'd, It wasted fourescore of the Royall Peeres: But age and time all earthly things out-weares, Through terrours, horrors, mischiefe and debate, By trust, by treason, by hopes doubts and feares, I got, I kept, I left and lost the State. Thus as disposing heauens doe smile or frowne, So Cares or Comforts wait vpon a Crowne. EDWARD THE V, KING OF England, And France, LORD OF IRELAND. If birth, if beauty, innocence and youth, Could make a Tyrant feele one sparke of grace, My crooked Vncle had beene mou'd to ruth, Beholding of my pitty-pleading face. But what auailes to spring from royall Race? What snerty is in beauty, strength, or wit? What is command, might, eminence and place, When Treason lurkes where Maiesty doth sit? My haplesse selfe had true false proofe of it: Nipt in my bud, and blasted in my bloome: Depriu'd of life by murther, most vnfit, And for three Kingdoms could not haue one tombe: Thus Treason all my glory ouer-topt, And ere the Fruit could spring, the Tree was lop't. RICHARD THE IIJ, KING OF ENGLAND, And France, LORD OF IRELAND, &amp;c. Ambition's like vnto a quenchlesse thirst: Ambition Angels threw from Heauen to Hell, Ambition (that infernall Hag) accurst, Ambitiously made me aspire, rebell: Ambition, that damned Necromanticke Spell, Made me clime proud, with shame to tumble down. By bloody murther I did all expell, Whose right, or might, debard me from the Crown. My smiles, my gifts, my fauours, or my frowne, Were fain'd, corrupt, vile flattry, death and spite. By cruell Tyranny I gat renowne, Till Heau'ns iust Iudge me iustly did requite. By blood I won, by blood I lost the throne. Detested liu'd; dy'd; lou'd, bewail'd of none. HENRY THE VIJ, KING OF ENGLAND, And FRANCE, Lord Of Ireland. I was the man (by Gods high grace assign'd) That for this restlesse Kingdome purchas'd rest: I York and Lancaster in one combin'd, That sundred had each other long opprest, My strength and policy th'Almighty blest. With good successe from first vnto the last: And high Iehouah turned to the best, A world of perills which my youth o're past. The white and red Rose I conioyned fast, In sacred Marriages coniugall band: I Traytors tam'd, and treason stood agast At me; strong guarded by my Makers hand. In glory and magnificence I raign'd, And fame, loue, and a tombe was all I gain'd. HENRY THE VIIJ, KING OF England, And France, LORD OF IRELAND. To both the Royall Houses I was Heyre; I made but one, of long contending, twaine: This Realme diuided drooping in despaire, I did rebind in my auspicious Raigne. I banisht Romish Vsurpation vaine. In France I Bullen, Turwin, Turney wan: The Stile of Faiths Defender I did gaine. Sixe wiues I had, three An's, two Kates, one Iane. In my expences Royall, beyond measure, Striuing in Noble Actions to exceede; Accounting Honour as my greatest Treasure: Yet various fancies did my frailty feede, I made and marr'd, I did, and I vndid, Till all my Greatnesse in a Graue was hid. EDWARD THE VI, KING OF England, FRANCE and IRELAND, Defender of the Faith, &amp;c. I seem'd in wisedome aged in my youth, A Princly patterne; I reform'd the time: With zeale and courage I maintain'd Gods truth, And Christian faith 'gainst Antichristian crime. My Father did begin; I, in my prime, Both Baal and Beliall from this Kingdome droue, With concords true harmonious heauenly chime, I caus'd be said and sung Gods truth and loue. From vertue vnto vertue still I stroue, I liu'd beloued both of God and men: My soule vnto her Maker soar'd aboue, My earthly part return'd to earth agen. Thus Death, my faire proceedings did preuent, And Peeres and People did my losse lament. MARY, QUEENE OF England, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &amp;c. No sooner I possest the Royall Throne, But true Religion straight was dispossest: Bad Councell caus'd Rome, Spaine and I, as one, To persecute, to martyr, and molest All that the vnstain'd truth of God profest: All such as dar'd oppugne the pow'rfull Pope, With grieuous tortures were opprest and prest, With Axes, Fire, and Faggot, and the Rope. Scarce any Land beneath the Heau'nly Cope, Afflicted was, as I caus'd this to bee: And when my Fortunes were in highest hope, Death at the fiue yeeres end arrested mee. No Bale would serue, I could command no ayd, But I in prison in my graue was laid. ELIZABETH, QVEENE OF England, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &amp;c. The griefes, the feares, the terrors and the toiles, The sleights, tricks, snares, that for my life were laid Popes, prisons, poysons, pistols, bloody broyles, All these incompast me (poore harmelesse Mayd) But I still trusting in my Makers ayde, Was still defended by his power diuine: My glory and my greatnesse was displai'd As farre as Sunne and Moone did euer shine. Gods mingled Seruice I did re-refine, From Romish rubbish, and from humane drosse. I yearely made the pride of Spaine decline: France and all Belgia I sau'd from losse: I was Arts patterne, t'Armes I was a Patron; I liu'd and dyed a Queene, a Maid, a Matron. IAMES, Of that Name The First, And I. Monarch of the whole Iland of Great Britaine, &amp;c. VVere all the flatt'ry of the world in me, Great King of hearts &amp; Arts, great Britaines King Yet all that flattery could not flatter thee: Or adde to thy renowne the smallest thing. My Muse (with truth and freedome) dares to sing, Thou wert a Monarch lou'd of God and Men. Two famous Kingdomes thou to one didst bring, And gau'st lost Britaines name her name agen. Thou causedst Doctors with their learned pen, The sacred Bible newly to translate. Thy wisdome found the damned powder'd Den, That hell had hatcht to ouerthrow thy state. And all the world thy Motto must allow, The peace makers are blest; and so art thou. CHARLES, Of that Name The First, And II. Monarch of the whole Iland of GREAT BRITAINE. KING of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, Gods immediate VICEGERENT, Supreame Head, &amp;c. Illustrious Off-spring of most glorious Stems, Our happy hope, our Royall Charles the great, Sucessiue Heyre to foure Rich Diadems, With gifts of Grace, and Learning high repleat. For thee th'Almighties ayd I doe intreate, To guide and prosper thy proceedings still, That long thou maist suruiue a Prince compleat, To guard the good, and to subuert the ill. And when (by Gods determin'd boundlesse will) Thy mortall part shall made immortall be, Then let thy liuing Fame the world full fill, In blessed famous memory of thee, And all true Britaines pray to God aboue, To match thy life and fortune with their loue. Charles Stewarte Marie Anagramma. Christ Arme vs Euer AT AL, Though feinds and men, to hurt vs should endeuer, (Against their force) AT AL, CHRIST ARMEVS EVER. A LIVING SADNES IN DVTY CONSECRATED TO THE IMMORTALL memory of our late Deceased all-beloued Soueraigne Lord, the Peerelesse Paragon of Princes, Iames, King of great Britaine, France and Ireland; who departed this Life at his Manour of Theobalds, on Sunday the 27. of March 1625. TO THE MOST HIGH AND PVISSENT Prince Charles by the Grace of God, the first of that name, and second Monarch of the whole Iland of Great Britaine. HIS VNDOVBTED ROYALTIES BEING VNITED VNDER one and the same his most glorious Crowne, the Kingdomes of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland; Gods Immediate Vice-Gerent; Supreme head of all Persons, and Defender of the true, ancient Christian Faith, in these his Empires and Dominions. Most Mighty Monarch of this mourning Land, Vpon the knees of my submissiue mind: I begge acceptance at your Royall hand, That my lamenting Muse may fauour finde. My Gracious Master was so good, so kinde, So iust, so much beloued neere and farre: Which generally did Loue, and Duty binde From all, and from me in particular. But as your Maiesty vndoubted are, The Heire vnto his Vertues and his Crowne: I pray, that whether Heauen send Peace or Warre, You likewise may inherit his Renowne. And as Death strucke his Earthly Glory downe, Left you in Maiesty, and mourning Chiefe: Yet through the World apparantly 'tis knowne, Your Sorrow is an vniuersall Griefe. Let this recomfort then your Princely heart, That in this Duty all men beares a part. Your Maiesties most humble and obedient Subiect and Seruant: Iohn Taylor. A Funerall Elegie vpon King Iames. You gushing Torrents of my Tearedrown'd eies, Sad Partners of my hearts Calamities, Tempestuous sighs, like winds in prison pent, (Which wanting vent) my grieued soule hath rent, Deepe wounding grones (companions of vnrest) Throngs from the bottome of my care-craz'd brest, You three, continuall fellowes of my moues, (My brinish teares, sad sighs and pondrous grones) I doe intreate you neuere to depart, But be the true assistants of my heart, In this great sorrow (that my trembling Quill Describes) which doth our L?d with mourning fill, Ah Death! could nought thy hunger satisfie, But thou must glut thy selfe with Maiesty? Could nothing thy insatiate thirst restraine, But Royall blood of our Dread Soueraigne? In this, thy spight exceeds beyond all bounds, And at one blow, 3. kingdomes fil'dst with wounds. When thou that fatall deadly stroake did'st strike, Then (Death) thou playd'st the tyrant-Catholike. Our griefes are Vniuersall, and the Summe Cast vp, the blow doth wound all Christendome. But wherefore, Death, doe I on thee exclaime? Thou cam'st in the Eternall Kings great name, For as no mortall pow'r can thee preuent, So thou doest neuer come, but thou art sent. And now thou cam'st vpon vnwelcome wings, To our best King, from the blest King of Kings, To summon him to change his earthly throne, For an Immortall, and a Heauenly one. (When men vnthankfull for a good receiu'd, Tis Iust that of that good they be bereau'd) His gouernement both God and men did please, Except such spirits, as might complaine of Ease, Repining Passions wearied with much Rest, The want to be molested, might molest. Such men thinke peace a torment, and no trouble Is worse then trouble, though it should come double. I speake of such as with our peace were cloyd Though War I think might well haue bin imploy'd. True Britaines wish iust warres to entertaine, (I meane no aide for Spinola or Spaine) But time and troubles would not suffer it, Nor Gods appointment would the same permit. He is inscrutable in all his waies, And at his pleasure humbleth and will raise, For patience is a vertue he regardeth, And in the end with victory rewardeth. But whither hath my mournefull Muse digrest? From my beloued Soueraigne Lord decast: Who was to vs, and we to him, eu'n thus, Too bad for him, and hee, too good for vs. For good men in their deaths, 'tis vnderstood, They leaue the bad, and goe vnto the good. This was the cause, why God did take from hence, This most Religious, Learned, Gracious Prince. This Paragon of Kings, this matchlesse Mirror, This Faiths defending Antichristian terror; This Royall all-beloued King of Hearts, This Patterne, and this Patron of good Arts This cabinet of mercy, Temperance, Prudence, and Iustice, that doth man aduance. This Magazine of Pious Clemency, This fountaine of true Liberality. This minde, where vertue daily did increase, This Peacefull Seruant to the God of Peace, This second great Apollo, from whose Raies, Poore Poetry did winne Immortall Baies, From whence the sacred Sisters, Treble Trine, Had life and motion, Influence diuine, These vertues did adorne his Diadem, And God in taking him, hath taken them. Of all which Blessings, (we must needs confesse) We are depriu'd for our vnworthinesse. A good man's neuer must till he be gone, And then most vaine and fruitlesse is our mone, But as Heau'ns fauours downe to vs descended: So if our thankefulnesse had but ascended, Had we made Conscience of our waies to sinne, So soone of him we not depriu'd had bin. Then let vs not lament his losse so much, But for our owne vnworthinesse was such. So from th'vnthankefull Iewes, God in his wrath, Tooke good Iosias, by vnlook'd for death. And for our sinnes, our ignorance must know, We haue procur'd and felt this curelesse blow, And Christendome, I feare, in losing him, Is much dismembred, and hath lost a limme. As by the fruit the tree may be exprest, His workes declar'd his learning manifest, Whereby his wisdome wan this great renowne, That second Salomon wore Britaines crowne, His pen restrain'd the strong, relieu'd the weake, And graciously he could write, doe and speake. He had more force and vigor in his words, Th? neigh'bring Princes could haue in their swords. France, Denmarke, Poland, Sweden, Germany, Spaine, Sauoy, Italy, and Muscouie, Bohemia, and the fruitfull Palatine, The Swisses, Grisons, and the Veltoline, As farre as euer Sol or Luna shin'd Beyond the Westerne, or the Easterne Inde. His counsell, and his fauours were requir'd, Approu'd, belou'd, applauded and admir'd: When round about the Nations farre and neere, With cruell bloody warres infested were; When Mars with sword and fire, in furious rage, Spoyl'd &amp; consum'd, not sparing sex or age; Whilst mothers (with great griefe) were childlesse made, And Sonne 'gainst Sire oppos'd with trenchant blade: When brother against brother, kinne 'gainst kinne; Through death and danger did destruction winne. When murthers mercilesse, and beastly Rapes Theft, famine (miseries in sundry shapes) While mischiefs thus great kingdomes ouerwhelm, Our prudent Steeresman held great Britaines helme, Conducting so this mighty Ship of state, That strangers enui'd, and admir'd thereat, When blessed Peace, with terrour and affright, Was in a mazed and distracted flight, By bloody warre, and in continuall Chase, Cours'd like a fearefull Hare, from place to place: Not daring any where to shew her head, She (happily) into this kingdome fled, Whom Royall Iames did freely entertaine, And graciously did keepe her all his reigne, Whilst other Lands (that for her absence mourne) With sighs and teares doe wish her backe returne. They finde in losing Her, they lost a blesse, A hundred Townes in France can witnesse this, Where Warres compulsion, or else composition, Did force Obedience, Bondage or Submission, Fields lay vntild, and fruitfull Land lay waste, And this was scarcely yet full three yeeres past, Where these vnciuill ciuill warres destroy'd Princes, Lords, Captaines, men of Note imploy'd, One hundred sixty seuen, in number all, And Common people did past number fall. These wretches (wearied with these home-bred Iars) Loue Peace, for being beaten sore with Wars. Nor doe I heere inueigh against iust Armes, But 'gainst vniust, vnnaturall Alarmes: Iust warres are made, to make vniust warres cease, And in this sort warres are the meanes of Peace. In all which turmoyles, Britaine was at rest, No thundring Cannons did our Peace molest. No churlish Drum, no Rapes, no flattring wounds; No Trumpets clangor to the Battell sounds, But euery Subiect here enioy'd his owne, And did securely reape what they had sowne. Each man beneath his Fig-tree and his Vine, In Peace with plenty did both suppe and dine. O God, how much thy goodnesse doth o'rflow, Thou hast not dealt with other Nations so! And all these blessings which from heauen did spring, Were by our Soueraignes wisdomes managing: Gods Steward, both in Office, and in name, And his account was euermore his aime: The thought from out his minde did seldome slip, That once he must giue vp his Steward-ship. His anger written on weake water was, His Patience and his Loue were grau'd in Brasse. His Fury like a wandring Starre soone gone, His Clemency was like a fixed one. So that as many lou'd him whilst he liu'd, More then so many by his Death are grieu'd. The hand of Heauen was onely his support, And blest him in the Nobles of his Court, To whom his Bounty was exprest so Royall, That he these twenty yeeres found none disloyall; But as bright Iewels of his Diadem, They faithfully seru'd him, he honour'd them. And as in life they were on him relying, So many of them vshered him in dying. Richmonds and Linox Duke first led the way, Next Dorsets spirit forsooke her house of Clay. Then Linox Duke againe, Duke Lodwicks brother Was third, and good Southampton fourth another. Lord Wriothsly next Southamptons Noble sonne, The race of his mortality did runne. Next dy'd old Charles, true honor'd Nottingham, (The Brooch and honor of his house and name) Braue Belsast next, his vitall threed was spun, And last, the Noble Marquesse Hambleton. These in the compasse of one yeere went hence, And led the way to their beloued Prince. And our deceased Soueraigne quickely went, To change earths Pompe, for glory permanent. Like Phœbus in his Course h'arose and ran, His reigne in March both ended and began. And as if he had bin a Starre that's fixt, His Rise and Set were but two daies betwixt, And once in two and twenty yeeres tis prou'd, That the most fixed Stars are something shou'd. But in his end, his Constancy we finde, He had no mutable or wauering minde: For that Religion, which his tongue and pen Did still defend with God, maintaine with men: That faith which in his Life he did expresse, He in his Death did constantly professe; His Treasure and his Iewels, they were such, As I thinke Englands Kings had ne'r so much. And still to men of honour and desert, His Coffers were as open as his heart. Peace, Patience, Iustice, Mercis, Pietie; These were his Iewels in variety: His Treasure alwaies was his Subiects Loue, Which they still gaue him as th'effects did proue: Which like to Earths contributary streames, Paid homage to their Soueraigne Ocean, Iames: He knew, that Princes Treasure to be best, That's layd vp in the loyall Subiects brest; And onely 'twas the riches of the minde, To which he couetously was inclinde. Thus was he blest in Person, blest in State, Blest in his first, and his in latter date: Blest in his education, blest in's learning, Blest in his wisdome, good and ill discerning, Blest in his marriage, and in his royall Race, But blessed most of all in Gods high grace. He did his God deuoutly serue and feare. He lou'd him, and he held his loue most deare: He honour'd and obeyde him faithfully; He in his fauour liu'd, and so did dye: His duty vnto God hee knew the way And meanes, to make his Subiects him obey: He knew that if he seru'd his God, that then He should be seru'd, and fear'd, and lou'd of men: And that if he Gods Statutes did respect, That men would feare his Statutes to neglect. Thus his Obedience vpward, did bring downe Obedience to his Person and his Crowne. He did aduance the good, supprest the bad, Relieu'd the poore, and comforted the sad: The widdow, and the orphant fatherlesse, He often hath suppli'd in their distresse, For why, to rich and poore, to great and small, He was a common Father vnto all. His affability and Princely parts, Made him a mighty Conquerour of Hearts: Offenders whom the law of life depriues, His mercy pardon'd and preseru'd their liues: To prisoners, and poore captiues miserie, Hee was a Magazine of charity: For losses that by sea, or fire did come, He hath bestowed many a liberall summe. Besides for Churches, it most plaine appeares, That more hath bin repair'd in twenty yeeres, (In honour of our God and Sauiours name) Then in an hundred yeeres before he came. Our ancient famous Vniuersities, Diuine, and Humane learnings Nurseries: Such dewes of grace, as the Almighties will, Was pleased (through those Limbecks) to distill. Which (spight of Romish rage, or Satans hate) Hath caus'd the glorious Gospell propogate: Our (light of learning) Iames, did still protect them, And as a nursing Father did affect them. Thus was Hee, for our soules, and bodies health, Defender of both Church, and Common-wealth. For Ireland, he hath much reduc'd that nation, Churches with land endow'd caus'd much plantation. Whereby Ciuility is planted there, The Kings obedience, and th'Almighties feare. These deeds this worthy godly Prince hath done, For which he hath perpetuall praises wonne. Ah! what a gracious Man of God was this? Mercy and Iustice did each other kisse; His Affabiutie whilst he did liue, Did make all men themselues to him to giue. Thus liu'd Great Iames, and thus great lames did dye, And dying thus, doth liue Eternally. With Honour he did liue, and Life forsooke, With Patience like a Lambe his death he tooke, And leauing Kingly cares, and Princely paine, He now inherits an Immortall Reigne: For royall grieu'd, perplexed Maiesty, He hath a Crowne of perpetuity: For miserable Pompe that's transitory, Hee is aduanc'd to euerlasting glory. And as he lou'd, and liu'd, and dy'd in Peace, So he in Peace did quietly decease: So let him rest in that most blest condition, That's subiect to no change or intermission; Whilst we his seruants, of him thus bereft, With grieued and perplexed hearts are left; But God in mercy looking on our grife, Before he gaue the wound, ordain'd reliefe: Though duteous Sorrow bids vs not forget This cloud of death, wherein our Sunne did set, His Sonnes resplendent Maiestie did rise, Loadstone, and Loadstarre to our hearts and eyes: He cleares our drooping spirits, he frees our scares, And (like the Sunne) dries vp our dewey teares. All those his seruants that lamenting grieue, King Charles his Grace and fauour doth releeue: But as they seru'd his Father, so he will Be their most louing Lord and Soueraigne still, As they were first to their Master liuing (being dead) They are releeued, and re-comforted. Thus Charity doth in succession runne, A Pious Father leaues a godly Sonne: Which Sonne his Kingly Gouernment shall passe, His Kingdomes Father, as his Father was. For though great Iames iater'd in earth doth lye, Great Charles his brest intombes his memorie, And heer's our comforts midst our discontents, Hee's season'd with his Fathers Documents, And as th'Almighty was his shield and speare, Protecting him from danger euery where: From most vnnaturall foule Conspiracie, From Powder-plots, and hellish Treachery, Whilst he both liu'd and dy'd, belou'd, renound, And Treason did it selfe it selfe confound, So I inuoke th'Eternall-Prouidence, To be to Charles a buckler and defence, Supported onely by the Power Diuine, As long as Sunne or Moone or Starres shall shine. To all that haue Read this Poeme. I boast not, but his Maiesty that's dead Was many times well pleas'd my lines to read: And euery line, word, syllable and letter, Were (by his reading) graced and made better; And howsoeuer they were good, or ill, His bounty shew'd, he did accept them still: He was so good and gracious vnto me, That I the vilest wretch on earth should be, If, for his sake, I had not writ this Verse, My last poore dutie, to his Royall Hearse. Two causes made me this sad Poeme write, The first my humble dutie did inuite, The last, to shunne that vice which doth include All other vices, foule Ingratitude. FINIS. FOR The sacred memoriall of the great, Noble, and ancient Example of Vertue and Honor, the Illustrious and welbeloued Lord, Charles Howard, Earle of Nottingham, Iustice in Eyre of all his Maiesties Forrests, Parks, and Chases on this side Trent; Knight of the Honourable Order of the Garter, and one of the Lords of his Maiesties most Honourable Priuie Councell; VVho departed this Life at his Mannour of Haleing in Surrey, on Thurseday the 14. of December, 1624. and was buried at Rigate, amongst his Honourable Ancestors, the 20. of December last, 1624. TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, Right Worshipfull, of both Sexes, who had either alliance by Marriage, Consanguinity by Birth, or bore loue to the Right Noble and truly vertuous deceased. I humbly craue your Worthinesse t'excuse This boldnesse of my poore vnlearned Muse, That hath presum'd so high a pitch to flye, In praise of Vertue and Nobility. I know this taske most fit for Learned men, For Homer, Ouid, or for Vigils pen: But for I with him haue both seru'd and sail'd, My gratefull duty hath so farre preuail'd, Boldly to write true Honours late decease, Whilst better Muse, please to hold their peace. And thus much to the world my Verse proclaimes, That neither gaine nor flattery are my aimes: But loue and duty to the Noble dead, Hath caus'd me cause these Lines be published. And therefore I entreat your gen'rous Hearts, T' accept my duty, pardon my deserts, Beare with my weakenesse, winke at my defects: Good purposes doe merit good effects; Poore earthen Vessels may hold precious Wine, And I presume that in this booke of mine, In many places you shall something finde, To please each Noble well-affected minde. And for excuse my Muse doth humbly plead, That you'l forbeare to iudge before you read. He that is euer a true wel-wisher, and obsequious Seruant to your Honours, Worships, and Noble Personages, Iohn Taylor. [And happy was this happy Anagram] Charles Howard, Earle of Nottinghame Anagramma: O Heauen cals, and hath true Glorie for me. And happy was this happy Anagram, Heauen calls Charles Howard Earle of Nottingham: And he obeyd the call, and gain'd true glory, For change of earthly Titles transitory. For the sacred Memoriall of the Great, Noble and Ancient example of Vertue and Honour, the Illustrious and welbeloued Lord, Charles Howard, Earle of Nottingham, Iustice in Eyre of all his Maiesties Forrests, Parks and Chases on this side Trent; Knight of the Honorable Order of the Garter, and one of the Lords of his Maiesties most Honorable priuy Councell. What English Muse forbeares to shead a teare For Englands Nestor, grauest, oldest Peere? Not onely old in number of his dayes, But old in vertue, &amp; all good mens praise: Whose actions all his pilgrimage did passe, More full of honour then his title was. And though his corps be seuer'd from his spirit, And that the world sufficient knowes his merit: Yet shall my poore vnworthy artlesse Verse, In dutious seruice wait vpon his Hearse. My selfe his Honour on the Seas attended. And with his bounty haue I beene befriended, And to acquite me from vnthankfulnesse, My lines shall here my gratitude expresse. No monumentall Marble reard on hie, He needs t'emblaze him to posterity, No flattring Epitaph he needs to haue, To be engrau'd vpon a gawdie graue, His life and actions are his Monument, Which fills each kingdome, Clime, and Continent. And when their memories shall stinke and dye, Who in most stately sepulchers doe lye, Then royall histories shall still relate To each degree, or age, or sex, or state, The vertue, valour, bounty, and the fame Of Englands all-beloued Nottingham: And Noble hearts his memory shall retaine, Vntill the world to Chaos turne againe. That yeere of wonderment call'd eighty eight, When fraud and force did our destruction wait, When Hell, and Rome, and Spaine did all agree, That wee should vanquish'd and inuaded be, Our foes at Sea thirty one thousand men, With neere foure hundred ships and Gallies then, Then this White Lyon rowz'd with irefull teene, Defending both his Country and his Queene, Like second Mars to battell braue he went, God making him his worthy Instrument: His Chieftaine, Champion and his Generall, With sixescore ships, and Vessels great and small, To conquer those that did for conquest come, And foyle the pow'r of Hell, and Spaine, and Rome. Then valour was with resolution mixt, And manhood with true Honour firmely fixt, When death and danger threatned euery where, Braue Charles (all fearelesse) did encourage fear. When roring cannons countercheckt heau'ns thunder And slaughterd men their vessels keeles lay vnder, The Sun eclips'd with smoke, skies darke and dim, And batt'ring bullets seuered lim from lim, When as that Sea might bee the Red Sea call'd, Then he with dreadlesse courage, vnappall'd, Like a bright Beacon, or a blazing Starre, Approu'd himselfe a thunderbolt of warre, Whose valour and example valiantly, Pursu'd and wonne a glorious victory. And then by him (through the Almighties hand) Preserued from inuasion was this Land. So that who euer shall his Tombe passe by, And shall enquire who there doth buried lye, If answere be but made, He's in this Graue, Who did in Eighty eight this Kingdome saue; Then is the totall told, and seruice best, Where with this little Land was euer blest. At 1596 Cales likewise the Sea-fight we did win, By his direction and graue disciplin The Spanish ships soone from his force retir'd, Some torne, some sunke, some taken, and some fir'd, And whensoere he gaue the ouerthrow, He nere insulted ore his conquerd foe, But like a Noble Lyon, euery way He scorn'd to prey vpon a yeelding prey: With pitty, piety, and true remorce, His clemency was mixt with manly force. Vnto his foes a noble care he had, Nor would affliction to affliction adde: So that his enemies much cause did find, To loue and honour his true noble mind. Yet 'gainst offenders he was sharply bent, Seuere in threats, and milde in punishment, His iustice would condemne, and in a breath His mercy sau'd whom iustice doom'd to death. His aduersaries he did oft relieue, And his reuenge was onely to forgiue. He knew that well got honour nere shall die, But make men liue vnto eternitie: It as his greatest riches he esteem'd, And Infamy he basest begg'ry deem'd. He knew, through worthy spirits may be crost, Yet if they lose no honour nothing's lost. And those that haue afraid of enuy bin, True honour or good fame did neuer win. If he an auaritious mind had bore, Of wealth no subiect then had had such store: So many yeeres Englands high Admirall, Fees, offices, and prizes that did fall, With gifts and fauors from the Queene and State, And other things, amounting to a rate: That had he beene a mizer, close of hand, No subiect had beene richer in this Land, In deeds of pitty, and true charity, Good house-keeping, and hospitality, Bounty, and courteous affability: He was the Brooch of true Nobility: And for these vertues men shall scarcely find, That he a fellow here hath left behind. He knew that Auarice and Honour be Two contraries that neuer will agree: And that the Spender shall haue true renowne, When infamy the Mizers fame shall drowne. He euery way most nobly was inclin'd, And lou'd no wealth but riches of the mind: His pleasure was, that those that did retaine To him, and serue, should by him thriue and gaine: And he thought t'was enough for him to haue, When as his seruants did both get and saue. So amongst Nobles I think few are such, That keepes so little, giues away so much. His latest VVill did make it plaine appeare, The loue which to his seruants he did beare. To great and small amongst them, more or lesse, His bounty did expresse his worthynesse: To all degrees that seru'd him euery one, His liberality excepted none. And though base Enuy often at him strooke, His fortitude was like a Rocke vnshooke. He knew that Fortunes changing was not strange, Times variation could not make him change, The frothy pompe of Earths prosperity, Nor enuious clouds of sad aduersity, Within his minde could no mutation strike, His courage and his carriage were alike: For when base Peasants shrinke at fortunes blowes, Then magnimity most richly showes: His grauity was in his life exprest, His good example made it manifest, His age did no way make his vertue liue, But vertue to his age did honour giue, So that the loue he wan tis vnderstood, Twas not for being old, but being good. Thus like a pollish'd sewell 'mongst his Peers, His vertue shin'd more brighter then his yeers: For Wisdome euer this account doth make, To loue age onely but for vertues sake. Neere ninety yeeres an honoured life he led: And honour's his reward, aliue, and dead, For who so nobly heer his life doth frame, Shall for his wages haue perpetuall same. His meditations hee did oft apply, How he might learne to liue, to learne to dye, And dy, to liue and reigne in glorious state, Which changing time can ne'r exterminate. And therefore long his wisdome did forecast, How he might best reforme offences past, Order things present, things to come foresee, Thus would his latter yeeres still busied be: He saw his Sand was neer runne out his Glasse, And wisely pondred in what state he was, His waning yeeres, his body full of anguish, Sense failing spirits drooping, force to languish, The ruin'd cottage of weake flesh and blood, Could not long stand, his wisdome vnderstood. He saw his tyde of life gan ebbe so low, Past all expectance it againe should flow: He knew his pilgrimage would soone expire, And that (from whence he came) he must retire. Old age and weake infirmities contend, Mans dissolution warnes him of his end: He knew all these to be deaths messengers, His Calends, Pursiuants, and Harbingers, And with a Christian conscience still he mark'd, He in his finall voyage was imbark'd. Which made him skilfully his course to steere, (The whilst his iudgment was both sound &amp; cleare) To that blest Hauen of eternall rest, Where he for euer liues among the blest. He did esteeme the world a barren field, That nought but snares, &amp; tares, and cares did yeeld, And therefore he did sow his hopes in heauen, Where plentious encrease to him is giuen. Thus was the period of his lifes expence, Thus Noble Nottingham departed hence, Who many yeeres did in his Countries right, In peace and warre, successefull speake and fight, Our oldest Garter Knight, and Counsellor, And sometimes Britaines great Ambassador. Now vnto you suruiuers, you that be The Branches of this honourable Tree: Though Verses to the dead no life can giue, They may be comforters of those that liue. We know, that God to man hath life but lent, And plac'd it in his bodies tenement, And when for it againe the Landlord cals, The Tenant must depart, the Cottage fals. God is most iust, and he will haue it knowne, That he in taking life, takes but his owne: Life is a debt which must to God be rendred, And Natures retribution must be tendred. Some pay in youth, and some in age doe pay, But tis a charge that all men must defray: For tis the lot of all mortality, When they begin to liue, begin to dye. And as from sin to sin we wander in, So death at last is wages for our sinne. He neither hath respect to sex or yeares, Or hath compassion of our sighes nor teares, He'll enter (spight of bars, or bolts, or locks) And like a bold intruder neuer knockes. To Kings and Caitiffes, rich, poore, great and small, Death playes the tyrant, and destroyes them all. He calls all creatures to account most strict, And no mans power his force can contradict. We must perforce be pleas'd with what he leaues vs, And not repine at ought which he bereaues vs. Hee's lawlesse, and tis folly to demand Amends, or restitution at his hand. He doth deride the griefe of those that mourne, And all our fraile afflictions laugh to scorne. For hee condemnes, and neuer heares the cause, He takes away, despight the power of Lawes. Yet hee our vassall euer doth remaine, From our first birth vnto our graue againe: And God doth in his seruice him employ, To be the bad mans terrour, good mans ioy, Death is the narrow doore to life eternall, Or else the broad gate vnto death infernall: But our Redeemer in his spotlesse offering, Did lead the way for vs to heauen by suffering. He was the death of death, when he did die, Then Death was swallow'd vp in victory, And by his rising blessed soules shall rise, And dwell in the celestiall Paradise. For these respects, you whose affinity, Propinquity, or consanguinity, Whose blood or whose alliance challenge can A part in this deceased Nobleman, The law of Nature and affection moues, That griefe and sorrow should expresse your loues, He was your secondary maker, and Your authors earthly being, and you stand In duty for your liues and honours bound To him, for by him haue you beene renown'd. Yet Death that's common vnto euery one, Should be intolerable vnto none: And therefore let his noble spirit rest, Amidst those ioyes which cannot be exprest, Let those that liue, his goodnesse imitate, And yeeld vnto the course of mortall fate. FINIS. A FVNERALL ELEGIE, IN THE SACRED MEMORY OF THE Right Reuerend, Right Honourable and Learned Father in GOD, Lancelot, Lord Bishop of VVinchester, Deane of his Maiesties Chappell, Prelate of the Right Honourable Order of the Garter, and one of the Lords of his Maiesties most Honourable Priuie Covncell: Who departed this life at his house in Southwarke, on Munday the 25??. of September last, 1626, and was Honourably Interred in Saint Sauiours Church in Southwarke, the XI. of Nouember. TO THE WORSHIPFVLL AND RELIGIOVS GENTLEMAN, M?.Iohn Parker, Citizen of London, and of the worshipfull Societie of Marchant-Taylors. A silly Taper, or a Candles light, Are vaine additious to make Sol more bright: Nor can one little water-drop augment The mighty bounds of Neptunes continent: The raging Winds that threaten sea and shore, For one mans breath is not increas'd the more, Nor can a handfull of vnstable sand, Rayse mounts of earth, or amplifie the land. So I, that am (the meanest man of men) Meane wanting learning, meaner for the pen, With glimering taper, or a drop of raine, Cannot increase the light, inlarge the maine, Or any way in fitting tearmes set forth, Right Reuerend Winchester, Admired worth: For all the learned Poets of these dayes Might write, and speake in his deserued prayse, And spend their inke and paper, and their spirits, Yet adde no fame or honour, to his merits. But as pure snow shewes whiter to the eye, When cole-black Crowes, or swarty Rauens are by: Or as the darknesse makes light seeme more cleare, So will his Vertues in my lines appeare. To speake his passage in this vale of strife, In London he had being first and life: Whose Parents (as became their reputation) Did bring him vp in worthy education, As Pembrooke-Hall in Cambridge witnesse will, Whereas his noble memory liues still. So passing on in this his mortall race, Aduanc'd by grace, from higher place to place, First to the Deanery of Westminster, Next to the Bishopricke of Chichester: King Iames did next to Elye him preferre, Which learned Prince made him his Almoner, Till (by Gods prouidence) not his desire, He was to Winchester translated higher; Deane of the Royall Chappell, and beside, The Garters Prelate he was dignifide. Then gracious Iames, did in his wisedome see, This worthy Lords vpright integrity: In whom all loyall vertues were innate, Made him a priuy Councellour of State. And as his honours still did higher grow, His minde in meeke humility was low; Thus like a blessed Samuel, was he Ordayned from his infancy, to be A valiant souldier of Christs faithfull Campe, And in Gods Church a learn'd illustrious Lamp. And as the Lord to Abraham did say, Goe from thy Country, and thy Kin away; And from thy Fathers house I charge thee goe, Vnto the Land that I to thee will showe: So this right reuerend Lord, was from his youth Cal'd from the world, to Gods eternall truth, And being one in Heau'ns high businesse sent, Though in the world, yet from the world he went. For though the world is, as 'tis vnderstood, Mans natiue Country, as he's flesh and blood; Yet is his worldly part a prison foule, Wherein in bondage lyes his purer soule, Which soule is heauenly, &amp; makes heauen her aime, And here she's in the World, not of the same. So this deceased Subiect of my muse, He liu'd and grieu'd to see the worlds abuse; And like a Ieremy, with sad laments He sigh'd and grieu'd, bewayling the euents Which haue, and doe, and daily still are like, Vpon this woefull age of ours to strike. He saw and grieu'd at what all men should grieue, How goodnesse small respect, could here achieue; And how the chiefest good that men doe craue, Is pompe and wealth, and rich apparell braue: How man will for his body haue good food, Good fire, good cloathes, good house, and lodging good, And all the care's how these goods may be had, And few men cared though their soules be bad: Thus the fraile World, &amp; impious times transgression, Strooke in his Christian heart, griefes deepe impression, That all that worldly was, he quite forgot, And vs'd the World, as if hee vs'd it not: Hee (by the Spirit of God) perceiued plaine, That all earthes pompe and glory is but vayne: And therefore with a lowly minde and meeke, He did Christs righteousnesse Kingdome seeke: For which, (euen as our Sauiours word is past) His earthly treasures were vppon him cast: For still the word of God confirm'd shall be, I'le honour them (saith he) that honour me. His heart was free from an ambitious thought, No popular applause of men he sought; His pride was godly, a true Christian pride, To know Christ, and to know him crucifide; And though fraile men are with vaine toyes intis'd, Hee wish'd to be disolu'd to be with Christ. His charity was not in out-ward show, No Pharisey-like Trumpet ere did blow, To make the World applause with speech or pen, When he in pitty pelp'd the wants of men. Two Schollers in th'Vniuersities, He (priuate) gaue most bountifull supplies: To Prisoners he sent many a secret summe, And the receiuers nere knew whence it come: God gaue to him, and for his sake agen He gaue it backe to helpe distressed men: Yet close and priuate, should his almes still be, That God might hane the glory, and not he. Where ere hee lodg'd, or where his house hee kept, His piety and charity nere slept: Where still his gifts hath close and secret beene, And (to the view of men) but seldome seene. When late our sins did Gods high wrath incence, That he destroy'd vs with the Pestilence; And that the poore did pine, the rich were fled, And Charity seem'd buried with the dead; Then this true godly, honorable man, Did with a zeale and loue most Christian; Knowing Saint Sauiours Parish to be large, Opprest with poore, and at excessiue charge; Meanes small, necessity exceeding great Many to feede, and little foode to eate: In this extreamity, this worthy Peere, Did in his charitie so good appeare, That by his bounty many soules were cherish'd, Which (but for him) vndoubtedly had perish'd. The like he did in succouring the destresse, Of many places in his Diocesse. He well remembred God had rais'd him high, In state of eminence and dignity; But yet his memory deseru'd more prayse, Remembring to what end God did him rayse; For men all of Degrees, estates, and rankes, Will giue to God some superficiall thankes, Confessing he hath in their state them set; But yet the end wherefore, they quite forget, Therefore he well and wisely vnderstood, That he had great promotions to be good; And that he was endued with earthly pelfe, To giue, and haue least ioy of it himselfe; And as a steward iust, what he possest, Hee still distributed to the opprest. And though mans merrits challenge nothing can, Yet God so loues a iust and righteous man; That here hee liues with his protection guarded, And after with eternall life rewarded. His Learning.His learning was approoued to be such, As scarcely any one man had so much: Yet though in Scholler-ship he did excell, His chiefest honour was, he vs'd it well. When Romes chiefe champion famous Bellarmine, Imploy'd his studies and his best ingine, To proue the Papall dignity had power O're Councells, Fathers, King or Emperour, Or Church, or sacred text Cannonicall, Or any thing which we may mortall call; And that these errours printed were in Rome, And scattred, and divulg'd through Christendome: Then Winchester, did for the Gospells right So learn'd, so grauely and profoundly write, His Booke that was Tortus Tortorum call'd, Which made the Roman Clergy all apal'd. He shew'd them there how vainly they did vaunt, How far from truth they were disconsonant: And how the Pope was prou'd the man of sinne, Maugre his mighty Bulwarke Bellarmine. Thus he (defending our Religion) Shooke Antichristian Romish Babilon, Proouing our faith to be true Catholike, And in antiquity Apostolike. Indeede his learning so transcendant was, And did so farre my silly praise surpasse, That I my wit and studies may confound, And in an Ocean bottomelesse be drown'd. Ile therefore cease to touch that lofty straine, So farre aboue the Circuite of my braine; His chiefest learning was, Gods Law he learn'd, Whereby to liue and dye hee well discern'd, As Malachy Malachy 2. 7. of Priests did Prophecy, His lips preserued knowledge plentiously, That sauing knowledge, which His Knowledge. Iohn Baptist brought Saluation, and Luke 1. 77. remitting sinnes he taught; Yea all his knowledge were to these intents, To know God, and keepe his Commandements. A single life he liu'd, but his desert, And vertue, was in singlnesse of heart: Well he knew Marriage or Virginity, Were (of themselues) no perfect sanctity; For mis-beleeuing Infidels doe eyther, Yet haue no perfect holinesse by neither: But where the gift of continence is giuen With single life, it is the grace of Heauen; And this blest gift was still in him so ample, That he both liu'd and dy'd a rare example. Thus liu'd he 70 yeeres, iust Dauids span, (Times circuite, for the Pilgrimage of man) And in a good age, Dauid-like deveast, With 1 Chron. 29. Honour, Daies and Riches fully blest. And for more honour of his hoary haires, Yeeres grac'd his person, vertue grac'd his yeeres: His port and places were of eminence, But 'twas his goodnesse was their excellence: So that although his honour was compleat, He grac'd it more in being good then great. His seruants of a Master are depriu'd, Who shewed himselfe to them whilst he suruiu'd, Not as an Austere Master, but still rather, A louing, and a wel-beloued father: His loue to them was in his gifts and cares, And theirs for him, is in their sighes and teares. Foure brothers, and two sisters they were late, But three haue finish'd their suruiuing date; Lancelot (the chiefe) Nicholas and Thomas, they Haue left this transitory house of clay; And as from but one father they did spring, So in one house they had their finishing. But Roger, Mary, Martha, you are left, And though you of your brethren are bereft, They are but gone, that you may come to them To Glory, to the new Ierusalem. Yet God's your father, as hee's theirs (in blisse) And Iesus Christ to you a brother is. But note the prudence, and the prouidence, Of this good man whom God hath taken hence. He well fore-saw his bodies dissolution, And therefore for his goods iust distribution, Hee for his sole Executor elected A man (that like himselfe) the world respected: For as my Lord all earthly pompe did hate, And did esteeme this world at little rate: As he did vertue loue, and vice abhor, So (without doubt) doth his Executor: And therefore he committed this great trust, To one he knew was honest, plaine and iust. Now for conclusion, for a finall end, Long time this Reuerend Father did attend, He knew that he to Nature was a debter, And therefore long'd to change this life for better. His heart was open still to welcome Death, His great desire was to expire his breath, He knew it is a passage must be past; A journey that all flesh must goe at last: A port of rest, a ceasing here to sinne, An end, where endlesse glory doth beginne. For though conuulsions, sighs, and sickly groanes, Our parents, friends, &amp; kindreds teares and moanes, The bells sad toling, and the mourning weede, Makes Death more dreadfull then it is indeede, Yet wise men all in generall agree, Tis naturall to dye, as borne to be, And as man cannot here auoyd his birth, So shunne hee cannot his returne to earth. The Pilgrimage, the race, the glasse is runne, The threed is spun, the victory is wonne; And Honourable Winchester is gone Vnto the Lambe, that sits vpon the Throne: For as I well haue scan'd vpon his name, And of it made a double Anagram: (And Anagrams oft-times include a fate) And 'tis no doubt but they explaine his State, For hauing past with troubles, griefes and cares, This transitory life, this vale of teares; Yet Lancelot Andrewes name, doth this portend, All sure, All due content, Crownes all attend. FINIS. [A Funerall Elegie vpon the death of the Duke of Richmond and Linox.] True louing Sorrovv, ATTIRED IN A ROBE OF VNFAINED Griefe, presented vpon occasion of the much bewailed Funerall of that Gracious and Illustrious Prince, Levvis Stevvard, Duke of Richmond and Linox, Earle of Newcastle and Darnely, Lord of Torbolton and Methuen, Baron of Settrington, Knight of the Noble Order of the Garter, Lord High Admirall, &amp; great Chamberlain of Scotland, Lord high Steward to the Kings most excellent Maiesties most Honourable Houshold, Gentleman of his Maiesties Bed-chamber, and one of his Maiesties most Honourable Priuie Councell for England and Scotland: who departed this life at White-hall, on Thursday the 12 of February 1624. whose obsequies were solemnly and Princely celebrated on Munday the 19 of Aprill following, described in forme as followeth. Dedicated generally to all his worthy Friends, and louing Seruants; and particularly to that trusty and welbeloued Seruant of his, Arthur Neassmith. A Funerall Elegie. And first my Muse findes, that his Graces name Significantly makes an Anagram. Lewis Stewarde. Anagram. Vertv is wel Eas'd.His Vertues such continuall paines did take For King and Countrie, Church and peoples sake; That for Earths courtly toyle, to him 'twas giuen, His Vertv is wel Eas'd i'the Court of Heauen. Great God, that to thy self wilt take thine own, By sundry waies, and means to man vnknown, Whose Eye of prouidence doth still perceiue When, where, why, who to take, or else to leaue, Whose mercy, and whose Iustice equall are, Both Infinite, to punish or to spare, All men doe know, that men to dye are borne, And from the earth, must to the earth returne. But Time and Circumstance coniecture may, For some great cause thou took'st this Duke away. Amongst vs lurks so many a foule offence, Which giues thee cause to take good men from hence: And that this Prince was good as well as great, His life and timelesse losse doth well repeate. Deuout and zealous to his God aboue: True to his King, as did his seruice proue: Discreet in Counsell, Noble in his minde, Most Charitably, Honourably kinde: So Affable, so Hopefull vnto all, And so Repleat with vertues generall, That we may say, This Land in losing him, Hath lost a gracious Peere, a prop, a lim. It must be true, that well he spends his daies, Whose actions doe attaine all peoples praise: And surely I suppose hee doth not liue, Who of this Duke a bad report can giue. So full endu'd he was of all good parts, With Noble Courtesie he wan all hearts, To loue and honour his admired minde, So well addicted, and so well enclin'd, That as a Diamond in gold transfixt, His vertues with his greatnesse were so mixt, That he as one of an immortall Race, Made Vertue vertuous, and gaue Grace to grace. Then since his goodnesse was so generall, The losse of him is Gen'rall vnto all: This being true, let's recollect our spirits, And weigh his worth with our vnworthy merits; And then our fraileties truely will confesse, God tooke him hence for our vnworthinesse: Death was in Message from th'Almighty sent. To summon him to Heau'ns high Parliament, He chang'd his Gracious Title transitory, And (by the grace of God) attain'd true Glory; And as his King had his integrity; So did the Commons share his Clemency, Which was so pleasing to his Makers sight, That bounteously he did his life requite, That Lambe-like, mildely hence hee tooke him sleeping, To his Eternall euer-blessed keeping. Thus as his name includes, so God is pleas'd, (From worldly sorrows) VERTV IS WEL EAS'D. No sicknesse or no physicke made him languish, He lay not long in heart-tormenting anguish: But as Gods feare was planted in his brest, So at his Rest, God tooke him to his Rest. When like a good Tree, laden full of fruite, Of Grace, of Vertue, Honour, and Repute: Euen in his best estate, too good for Earth, Then did his soule put on a second Birth. And though his part of fraile mortality, In Monumentall Marble heere doth lye: Yet thousands weeping soules, with deepe laments, As his most woefull mourning Monuments, I daily see, whose visages doe show That Hee's inter'd within their hearts below; Whose faces seeme an Epitaph to beare, That men may Reade who is intombed there. Epitaph. Good, Gracious, Great, Richmond &amp; Linox Duke, God, King, and Countries seruant heere doth lye; Whose liuing Merits merit no rebuke, For whose liues losse lamenting Memory, Our hearts are groning Graues of griefes and cares, Which when we dye, wee'l leaue vnto our heyres. FINIS. GREAT BRITAINE ALL IN BLACKE. OR, A short Elegie written in the manner of Æquiuoques, in a sad and dutifull remembrance of the Royall Prince Henry. Oh for a Quill of that Arabian Wing, That's hatcht in embers of Sun-kindled fire, Who to her selfe, her selfe doth issue bring, And three in one, is Young, and Dam, and Sire. Oh, that I could to Virgils veine aspire, Or Homers Verse the golden-languag'd Greeke, In polish'd phrases I my lines would tyre, Into the depth of Art my Muse would seeke. Mean time she 'mongst the linguish'd Poets throngs; Although she want the helpe of Forraigne Tongs. To write great Britaines wo how am I able? That hauing lost a peerelesse Princely Sonne, So wise, so graue, so stout, so amiable, Whose Vertues shin'd as did the mid-dayes Sunne, And did illustrate all our Hemispheare, Now all the world affoords not him his pheare. His Royall minde was euermore dispos'd, From vertue vnto vertue to accrue: On good deserts his bountie he dispos'd, Which made him follow'd by so braue a crue, That though himselfe was peerlesse, many a Peere, As his Attendants, dayly did appeare. In him the Thundrers braine-borne daughter Pallas Had tane possession, as her natiue Clime: In him, and his terrestriall heau'nly Palace, Was taught how men by vertuous deeds shal clime, So that although his yeeres were in the spring, He was true honours Fount and valors Spring. So firme, so stable, and so continent, So wise, so valiant, and so truly chaste: That from his Microcosmos continent, All heau'n-abhorred hel-hatch'd lust was chac'd: Hee ran no vicious vice alluring grace, To staine the glory of his Royall race. His soule, from whence it came, is gone againe, And earth hath tane, what did to earth belong: He whilom to this Land was such a Gaine, That mem'ry of his losse must needs be long. All states and sexes, both the young and graue, Lament his timelesse going to his Graue. Man-murdring death, blinde, cruell, fierce and fell, How dost thou gripe him in thy meagre armes! By thy rude stroke this Prince of Princes fell, Whose valor brau'd the mighty God of Armes: Right well in peace, he could of peace debate: Dreadlesse of dreadfull danger or debate. Robustuous rawbon'd monster death, to teare From vs our happy hope we did enioy: And turne our many ioyes to many a teare, Who else might ioyfully haue liu'd in ioy! As wind on thousands all at once doth blow, By his deaths stroke so millions feele the blow. Well could I wish, (but wishing is in vaine) That many millions, and amongst them I Had sluc'd the bloods from euery flowing veine, And vented floods of water from each eye: T'hane sau'd the life of this Maiestike Heyre, Would thousand soules had wandred in the ayre. But cease, my Muse, thou farre vnworthy art To name his name, whose praise on hie doth mount: Leaue, (leaue I say) this taske to men of Art, And let his soule rest in sweet Zions Mount: His Angell spright hath bid the world adue, And earth hath claim'd his body as a due. Epitaph. Here vnder ground great HENRIES corps doth lie, If God were pleas'd, I wish it were a lye. Iohn Taylor. THE MVSES MOVRNING: OR, FVNERALL SONNETS ON THE Death of Iohn Moray Esquire. TO THE WHOLE AND ENTIRE NVMBER OF THE Noble and Ancient name of Morayes, Iohn Taylor dedicates these sad Funerall Sonnets. Sonnet. 1. [VVhen King Corbredus wore the Scottish Crowne] VVhen King Corbredus wore the Scottish Crowne, The Romanes did the Britaine Land afflict: But Corbred ioyn'd confederate with the Pict, By whom Queen Woadaes foes were ouerthrowne. The Morayes then, to haue their valour knowne, Did first the Romane forces contradict: And made them render vp their liues so strict, That horse and foot, and all were beaten downe. Loe thus began the Morayes honour'd Race, Of memorable Ancient worthy fame: And since the fiue and fiftieth yeere of Grace, In Scotland hath suruiu'd that noble name. To whom aliue, and to my dead friends hearse, In duty heere I consecrate this verse. Hee that is euer obliged to your Noble name: Iohn Taylor. Sonnet. 2. [Weepe euerlastingly, you Nymphs diuine] Weepe euerlastingly, you Nymphs diuine, Your very Quintessence is waste and spent: Sigh, grone and weepe, with wofull languishment, Dead is the life that made your Glories shine. The heau'nly numbers of your Sacred nine, He tun'd as an Aetheriall Instrument, So sweet, as if the Gods did all consent In him their Consort holy to combine. Weepe, Muses, euerlasting lament, Eclipsed is your Sire Apollo's shrine: Grim Death, the life hath from your Champion rent, And therefore sigh, grone, weepe, lament and pine: And let the Lawrell rot, consume and wither, Dye, Muses, and be Tomb'd with him together. Sonnets. 3. [From two strong Iailes thy corps &amp; soul's acquitted] From two strong Iailes thy corps &amp; soul's acquitted, The one compact of flesh, and bloud and bone: The other vnrelenting sencelesse stone, By God to one, by man to one committed. I euer did expect a happy time, When thou shouldst shake thy bondage from thy backe: I euer hop'd that thy vnwilling crime Would be forgot, and thou secur'd from wracke. For this I wish'd and prai'd both day and night: I onely aym'd to haue thy body freed, But heau'n, (beyond my reason) had decreed, Soule, body, both at once to free thee quite. Thou in thy life hast past a world of trouble, But death from double Iailes hath freed thee double. Sonnet. 4. [Corruption, Incorruption hath put on] Corruption, Incorruption hath put on, Immortall, weake mortality is made: Earths wo hath gain'd a happy heauenly throne, By death, life dyes, by life deaths force doth fade Though death kill life, yet life doth conquer death, Death but puts off our Rags of shame and sinne: When for a moment's an eternall breath, Life (passing through the dore of death) doth win. This thou well knowst (my much beloued friend) And therefore thou didst dare death to his worst, But he (much busied) could not thee attend, Or durst not, till thy cares thy heart had burst. And then the slaue came stealing like a thiefe, And 'gainst his will, did giue thy woes reliefe. Sonnet. 5. [Thou fortunes foot-ball, whom she vs'd to tosse] Thou fortunes foot-ball, whom she vs'd to tosse, From wrong to wrong, from wo to wo againe: From griefe rebounding backe to pinching paine, As't please the blind-fold Dame to blesse or crosse: But thou, vnmou'd with either gaine or losse, Nor ioy, nor care, could vexe thy constant braine: Thou smil'dst at all her buffets with disdaine, And all her fauours thou esteem'dst as drosse: Her and her Fauorites thou still didst deeme Iust as they are, not as they seeme to be: Her Minions all as fooles thou didst esteeme, And that's the cause she would not fauour thee: Then since such reck'ning she of fooles doth make: Would thou hadst beene one, for her fauours sake. Sonnet. 6. [Tis written in the euerliuing Word] Tis written in the euerliuing Word, (The Rule and Square that men should liue thereby) Afflictions are the tuch-stones of the Lord. By which he onely doth his seruants try. Then Noble Moray, thou hadst many a tuch, And still thy patience good and currant prou'd, Thy manly carriage in thy griefs were such, Which made thee (more then much) admir'd and lou'd. What yeer, what month, week, day or fading houre, Wherein some mischiefe did thee not befall? Yet had Affliction ouer thee no power To conquer thee, but thou didst conquer all. Vnnumbred times thou wast both toucht and tri'd, And in thy Makers feare and fauour dy'd. Sonnet. 7. [VVeep heart, weepe eyes, weep my vnable pen] VVeep heart, weepe eyes, weep my vnable pen, In teares of blood, of water, and Inke: With bread of sorrow, and afflictions drinke I liue, for I haue lost a man of men. Yet heart, eyes, pen, dry vp your teares agen, He is not lost, he's rather new found: Enfranchis'd from a dolefull theeuish den, And with a rich Immortall Crowne is crownd, Then hart, eies pen no more with teares be drownd Weepe not for him that doth reioyce for euer: Yet this againe my comfort doth confound, Hee's lost to mee, and I shall find him neuer. Then weep Muse, heart, eies, pen, lament and weep: My ioyes are buried in eternall sleepe. Sonnet. 8. [Sleepe, gentle, spirit, in Eternall rest.] Sleepe, gentle, spirit, in Eternall rest. Free from all heart-tormenting sorrow sleepe: Whilst I doe vent from my care-crazed brest, Hart-wondring sighs that there their mansion keep: And let my grones from out that Cauerne deepe, With lamentations and cloud-cracking thunder, And let mine eyes an Inundation weepe, Let sighs, grones, teares, make all the world to wonder, I meane my little Microcosmo world, Sigh stormes, grone thunder, weep a floud of teares: Through eu'ry part of me, let griefe be hurld, That whosoeuer my lamenting heares, May mone (with me) the cause of this my Ditty, Or if not mone with me, vouchsafe to pitty. Sonnet. 9. [Since cursed fates haue fatally decreed] Since cursed fates haue fatally decreed To tosse and tumble harmelesse Innocence: And all the crue of hels abortiue breed Haue glutted Enuies maw, by lawes defence: Yet God whose knowledge knows the least offence, Who all things sees, with his all-searching eye. Doth with his glorious great omnipotence, Right wronged wrongs, &amp; heares his seruants cry. His mercie's not immur'd within the sky, But freely he doth powre it downe on earth: He with afflictions scourge his sonnes doth try, And when he pleases, turnes their mone to mirth, And though man liues in care, and dies in sorrow, A heauy euening brings a ioyfull morrow. Sonnet. 10. [Well hast thou runne in this thy weary race] Well hast thou runne in this thy weary race, Well hast thou fought with Satan hand to h?d: Th'ast won the Goale, and gain'd the blessed Land, That's neither limitted with time or place. There thou attendest on the throne of Grace, There Angels, and Archangels sweetly sing: Eternall praises to th'eternall King, And see the glorious brightnesse of his face. All this I (doubt not) but thou well hast done, Not of thy selfe (with shamefull sinne polluted) But thy Redeemer hath the conquest wonne, And vnto thee the victorie's imputed. He paid the score, and cancell'd all thy bands, And gaue thee to his blessed Fathers hands. Sonnet. 11. [Now may you theeuing Poets filch and steale] Now may you theeuing Poets filch and steale, Without controlement breaking Priscians pate: For he that whilom could your theft reueale, Your Criticke, and your Hypercriticke late, Now may you cog and lye and sweare and prate, And make your idle verses lame and halt: For by the pow'r of euiternall Fate, Hee's gone that could and would correct each fault. But you haue greatest cause to moane his want. You sacred heau'nly Sisters (three times thrice) He from your Gardens, could all weeds supplant, And replant fruites and flowres of peerelesse price; He kept (vnbroke) your Numbers, Tipes &amp; Tropes: But now hee's dead, dead are your onely hopes. Sonnet. 12. [As Solon, to rich haplesse Crœsus said] As Solon, to rich haplesse Crœsus said, No man, is happy till his life doth end: The proofe in thee so plainly is displaid, As if he thy Natiuity had kend. What mortall miseries could mischiefe send, But thou therein hast had a treble share: As if Calamities their powers should bend, To make thy Corps a treasure-house of care? Yet fell Aduersity thou didst out-dare, And valiantly 'gainst stormes of woe resisted: Loue of the world thy minde could not insnare, Thou knewst wherein the best of best consisted. And as old Solon said, so I agree, Death makes men happy, as it hath done thee. Sonnet. 13. [No Monumentall Trophee Vertue needes] No Monumentall Trophee Vertue needes, And good report a marble Tombe out-weares: Fame plaies the Herald, &amp; proclaimes mens deeds, Her Trumps shrill sound the spacious world heares. And such an vniuersall Tombe hast thou, Borne on the tops of thousand thousand tongs: Thy liuing merit doth thy name allow A Monument for euer, which belongs To none but such as whilom was thy selfe, Who vs'd the world as if they vs'd it not: And did acknowledge misbegotten pelfe, Must (like the getters of it) rust and rot. And such a liuing Tombe thy Corps inherit, A good report, according to thy merit. Sonnet. 14. [Had I the skill of Homer, Maro, Naso] Had I the skill of Homer, Maro, Naso, Or had I that Admir'd ornated stile Of Petrark, or the braue Italian Tasso, I could not ouermuch thy praise compile. But as I am (alas and woe the while) A poore vnlearned silly simple swaine: At whose attempt the world with scorn will smile, And flout th'vnshapen issue of my braine. But duty bids me inch into this Maine, Though my performance be but weake of store, Yet worthy mindes this goodnesse doe retaine, Not to despise the seruice of the poore. I lou'd him liuing, and my loue to show, My least and last poore loue I heere bestow. FINIS. A FVNERALL ELEGY: DEPLORING THE DEATH OF THE TRVE Patterne, Patrone, and mirrour of Honour, the Right Honorable Lord, Iohn Ramsey, Lord Viscount Hadington, Earle of Holdernesse, Who departed this life on Tuesday the 24 of Ianuary last, and was buried in the Abby-Church of Westminster on Tuesday the last of February following. [An arme and hand (well Arm'd with Heav'nly might)] Hæc dextra vindex, Principis &amp; Patriæ, An arme and hand (well Arm'd with Heav'nly might) That gripes a iust drawne Sword, thrust through a Heart; Adorned with a Royall Diadem: This, and this Motto was his owne by right, Giuen by his Soveraigne for his iust desert, And in his Coate of Armes inserted them. His right Hand did reuenge, and ouercame, His Prince and Countries foes, and purchas'd fame. TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE and vertuous Lady, the Lady Martha, Countesse of Holdernesse. Right Honoured Madame, to your noble view, These lines of greife, with griefe I dedicate: Not that I would your cares a fresh renew, Or any way your sorrowes aggraunte. If you but please to reade what I relate, My hope is, that your grieued heart shall finde Some things that may your woe extenuate, And adde some comfort to your care-craz'd minde, And as you still haue nobly beene inclin'd, To beare with Christian patience euery crosse: So be that Vertue still to you combinde, Supporting you, to vndergoe this losse. Thus crauing pardon, I the heau'ns implore, To make your sorrowers lesse, your comforts more. Iohn Taylor. A Sonnet of true and notable obseruations, vpon seuen seuerall Teuesdayes. Vpon a Tuesday hee his Birth beganne. Vpon a Tuesday he his baptisme had, Vpon a Tuesday hee his Honour wanne, Vpon the Gowries, (whose intents were bad.) Vpon a Tuesday hee at first did wed The Noble Sussex daughter, who deceast: Vpon a Tuesday then hee married Sir William Cockains, Childe, by heau'ns behest. Vpon a Tuesday hee did taste Deaths Cup, And to his blest Redeemer gaue his spirit. Vpon a Tuesday hee was closed vp Within his Tombe, which doth his Corps inherit. Thus vpon Tuesdaies 'twas his lot to haue, Birth, Baptisme, Honor, two Wiues, Death &amp; Graue. A FVNERALL ELEGY. You Poets all, where is your Art become? Are you all tong-ti'd? ar your Muses dum? Or are your sorrows in your brests so shut That you your pens to paper cannot put? Can neither duty, or your loue expresse, The lamentable losse of Holdernesse? Alas! I know, that you doe know, his Worth Was farre beyond your skils to blazon forth, And that when you had done what could be done, It had beene as a Taper to the Sunne. He was an Ocean, for whose sake I know, A dry inuention may with plenty flowe: He was a well manured fertile field, Which to a barren wit would haruest yeeld: He was a Subiect of transcendent size, Beyond each vulgar pen to Poetize: And though I know my selfe vnworthy farre, With my poore Glow-worme Muse, t'attend this Starre: Yea, though I cannot as I would endite, As tribute here I offer vp my mite, Which in his Noble Treasury I throw, My latest Duty that I can bestow. And well I hope these lines of mine shall last, When as his Tombe by Time shall be defac'd, Yea, though I had no hope to liue so long, To write his Epicedium, or Deaths song: Yet since God so decrees, this Elegie My duty, loue, and thankes, shall testifie. How can the World but be in Honour poore, Since it in losing him, hath lost such store? Or how can Vertue hope to liue and thriue, Hee's dead, whose life preserued her aliue, Religion was his Tutresse, and his Matron, And vnto her he was a zealous Patron; True Charity belou'd with him did liue, And (to the poore) his Glory was to giue. Yet was his bounty from the world so hid; His right hand knew not what his left hand did; So that his carriage, and his Noble parts, Iustly deseru'd, and firmely kept mens hearts, That his true praise great Britaines Bounds did fill, And no man e're had cause to wish him ill. His merits (through Heau'ns fauour) did afford, That Holdernesse had euery mans good word, For though the world doth vndergoe this curse, That euery day it waxeth worse and worse: He had a Noble and a Christian way, Whereby his life was better'd euery day. For to his end, eu'n from his dayes of youth, His time did fade, but goodnesse still had growth, So as his life did weare, his Vertue grew, And Grace did daily still more Grace renew. Hee was no diuing Politician, Or proiect-seeking Monopolitan. Hee ne'r prouok'd the silly orphants cryes, Nor fill'd with teares the woefull widdowes eyes, But as his Princes fauour he did merit, Hee vs'd it with such modesty of Spirit, That though he might almost haue what he would, Yet in such bounds he his demaunds did hold, Which Honour and his Conscience did restraine, That Prince or people neuer could complaine. So as his life was all good mens content, His death doth generally make all lament; Much like a fruitfull piece of land well till'd, Or as a Box with precious oyntment fill'd, Eu'n so his Actions and his Conuersation Pleasd, pleasur'd and much honour'd all our Nation. And though that Honours doe change manners much, Yet sure in him th'effects were neuer such: Though merit, and the Kings benignity, Did raise him vnto Noble dignity, Though he in Titles was promoted high, Yet still his minde retain'd Humility, That though desert had made his honours more, His minde was rais'd no higher then before. Promotion with humility combind A lofty Title, and a lowly minde. These Vertues are exceeding great and rare, And not by many men possessed are, And yet in him these gifts were so apparent, As if they had beene naturall inherent. For had he beene with loue of Pride endowd, He had the means that might haue made him proud. Hee ne'r esteem'd Court complementing bubbles, Nor car'd hee for the flattring Knee that doubles: Hee knew it was Ambitions onely end, To mount vp higher when it seemes to bend, And therefore he these frothy toyes did shunne: (Not fit for men, but Monkeyes to be done) And in his actions shew'd himselfe to be Full of plaine, honest, true integrity: He euery way himselfe did so demeane, That from his haruest good and bad might gleane Instructions to direct, and good directions How to instruct their follies fond affections No doubt but God did him preordinate, To be a speciall blessing to the State, By constellation and Heau'ns Influence, Mark'd for remarked seruice for his Prince: For all his youth almost to manly age, He was to Royall Iames a trusty Page, When as his conuersation and behauiour, Gain'd and retain'd his Soueraignes speciall fauour. In our Redemptions sixteenth hundred yeare, Then did his seruice happily appeare Then did he proue himselfe Heau'ns instrument, His Gracious Masters murther to preuent, Vpon that day of famous memory, Of Gowries wracke, and blacke Conspiracy. That day of note (which ne'r shall be forgot) That fift of August, 'twas his lucky lot To kill a brace of Traytors, at the time When as they were in action of the crime. For when the younger brother of the twaine, In murd'rous manner would the King haue slaine: When nothing could his treachery diuert, But that he vowd to stabbe his Soueraignes heart, The whilst the King and hee with eager will Were striuing, one to saue, and one to kill, So long that bustling both 'twixt life and death, They both were tyr'd and almost out of breath, The King, (like Daniel in the Lyons Den) As 'twere by miracle preserued then, Then Noble Ramsey was by God appointed, To saue his Soueraigne, and the Lords Anointed; For he (by Gods direction) found a way, Where they were scuffling, and without delay, He strait made Alexander Rewthen feele The force and fury of reuenging steele. For with three stabs he did the Traytor wound, And cast him downe the staires (an Act renown'd) When strait Earle Gowry found his brother slaine, With two drawn swords ran vp the staires amaine, Well-knowing of his lifes approaching date, Infus'd with rage and madnesse desperate, Laying about him like a demy-Diuell, With purpose to conclude his last act euill: With many a furious stroke and ill-meant thrust, He madly did his best to doe his worst, Whilst this deceased Lord a Bulwarke stood, And wounded Nobly spent his Noble blood, And with a thrust most fortunate and fierce, He with his sword the Earles heart through did pierce. This happy seruice of most high esteeme, Was but his duty, as himselfe did deeme, Yea, though it was an action meritorious, Yet selfe-opinion made him not vaine-glorious, To arme or sword did he no praise impute, Nor to his courage stoute and resolute. But thanking God that had him so directed, Whereby this worthy seruice was effected, Attributing all praise and Maiestie To God that made him meanes of victorie. Thus he like one of Dauids Worthies then, Gain'd at one time the loue of God and men: Of God, for his humility of heart, Of men, for his good seruice and desert. Consider you these mournefull lines that read, Thinke but how much true Noblenesse is dead, Which hauing pondred well, who can forbeare, But for his losse to spend a sigh or teare? For all that lou'd King Iames, must likewise loue Him, whose good seruice did so faithfull proue, Who lou'd his Master so, that men might see That from him long he could not sundred be; And as he truely on him here attended, So knowing him to higher state ascended, To make his loyalty the more appeare, He left this world, to wait vpon him there. Each honest Britaine in his losse hath share, The griefe is vniuersall, and the care Hath tane possession of both high and low, Eu'n from the Royall Throne vnto the Plough. The King hath lost a seruant true and iust, In whom he might repose especiall trust, And his companions Peeres haue lost a friend, Whose vertues very few men could transcend: His honourable Countesse she hath lost The comfort where her ioy consisted most: His Nobles father' in lawes are full of griefe, And are (in sorrowes) equall with the chiefe: His worthy honour'd brethren are possest, With each of them a sad and grieued brest: And from his seruants, death a Lord hath tane, Whose like they haue no hope to finde againe. His kindred all are fill'd with sad laments, His friends are fraught with woe and discontents, His friends (say I) alas, he had no foes, And therefore all are partners in these woes. I, in particular am now depriu'd Of him who formerly when he suruiu'd, Did cause King Iames of his especiall grace, On me (desertlesse) to bestow a place, Which makes me in these poore sad lines expresse My loue, my duty, and my thankefulnesse: Thus as the waues each other hath in chase, So is our life in this our mortall race: Through many changes from natiuity, We gaine our manhood or maturitie: And this deare Lord before his Winters age, At mid-time was abridg'd his Pilgrimage, Yet to the world it very plaine appeares, His age was more in goodnesse then in yeeres. Thus euery one may for his losse complaine, All losers, onely Heau'n and he did gaine. His mortall race hee heere so well did runne, That good report and loue his life hath wonne. The glorious hoast of Heau'n hath gain'd a spirit, (Through his firme faith in his Redeemers merit) And he an earthly Earledome hath forgone, For true content, and an immortall Throne. He liu'd the life of Grace whilst he was heere, And therefore hath the life of Glory there. He through th'assistance of his Makers might, Hath fought a good, a valiant, Christian fight, And now inshrin'd in euerlasting blisse, He from his house of Clay aduanced is, His course he ranne so in this vale of strife, That he hath wonne, and weares a Crowne of life; Of true eternall happinesse possest, Whilst we with cares and sorrowes are opprest. FINIS. IOHN RAMSEYE Anagramma. HONER'S I AYME, MY HONER'S AYE. To Vertve, and to Honovr once in Rome, Two stately Temples there erected was, Where none might vnto Honours Temple come, But first through Vertves Temple they must passe. Which was an Emblem, and a Document, That men by vertue must true honour winne, And that, that Honovr shall be permanent, Which onely did from Vertue first beginne. Thus was this Noble Lords high Honour wonne, Through Vertue, and by Vertue it increas'd: And though his mortall Pilgrimage be done, Yet shall his Honour neuer bee deceast. And as for him, his Anagrams doe say. Honer's I Ayme; Therefore My Honer's Aye. THE VVATER-CORMORANT. DEDICATED TO GENTLEMEN, AND THOSE That Are Gentle. [My Cormorant against these doth inuey] My Cormorant against these doth inuey, And proues himselfe much better farre then they. A Jesuite. The Argvment. King-killing Monsters out of Heauens mouth spew'd, Caters, and Butchers, vnto Rome and Hell: The bane of Youth and Age, in blood imbrew'd: Perditions gulph, Where all foule Treasons dwell. Lands, liues, and Soules vnder the sauing stile Of Iesvs, they deuoure, confound, beguile. In setting downe this Sect of blood compact, Me thinkes I see a tragick Sceane in act: The Stage all hang'd with the sad death of Kings, From whose bewailing storie sorrow springs. The Actors dipt in crueltie and blood, Yet make bad deeds passe in the name of good. And kindling new Commotions, they conspire With their hot Zeale, to set whole Realmes on fire, As 'twas apparent when they did combine, Against vs, in their fatall Powder-Mine. All Hell for that blacke Treason was plow'd vp, And mischiefe dranke deepe of damnations cup: The whole vast Ocean sea, no harbour grants To such deuouring greedy Cormorants, In the wide gulph of their abhorr'd designes Are thoughts that find no roome in honest mindes. And now I speake of Rome euen in her Sea, The Jesuites the dang'rous whirle-pooles be. Religions are made Waues, that rise and fall Before the wind or breath Pontificall. The Pope sends stormes forth, seuers or combines, According to his mood, it raines or shines; And who is ready to put all his will In execution, but the Iesuite still. Nor hath this Cormerant long tane degree, For Esacus more ancient is then hee: Yeares thousands since Troyes sonne he was created, And from a man but to a Bird translated, Whereas the Iesuite deriues descent But from Ignatius Loyala, that went For a maim'd Spanish souldier, but herein The difference rises, which hath euer bin: From Man to Bird, one's chang'd shape began, The other to a Diuell from a Man. Yet here in these wide maw'd Esacians, May well agree with these Ignatians, First black's the colour of the greedy Fowle, And black's the Iesuites habite like his soule, The bird is leane though oft he bee full craw'd, The Iesuit's hatchet fac'd, and wattle jaw'd, The Cormorant (as nature best befits) Still without chewing doth deuoure whole bits, So Jesuits swallow many a Lordly liuing, All at a gulp without grace or thankes-giuing. The birds throat (gaping) without intermission, Resembles their most cruell Inquisition, From neither is, Non est redemptio, For what into the Corm'rants throat doth goe, Or Jesuits Barrathrum doth once retaine, It ne're returnes fit for good vse againe. Eightie yeares since hee stole the Epithite From Iesvs, to bee call'd a Iesuite. But I could find him out a style more right, From Iudas to bee nam'd Iscariotite. Though Paul the third their title did approue, Yet he confirm'd their number that aboue Threescore they should not be, and yet we see, How much increased now the vipers be, That many a thousand Christian lyes and grones, Vnder the slan'ry of these diuelish drones, And he that knowes but truly what they are, Will judge a Cormorant's their better farre. A Separatist. The Argvment. Here earth and hell haue made a false commixion, Of painted zeale, and holinesse, and loue: Of Faith, of Hope, of Charity, (in fiction) Jn smoake and shadowes as the fruits doe proue, Hypocrisie, which long prayers doth repeate, Deuoureth Widowes, and poore Orphans cheate. Now enters next to play his Oylie part A Saint in tongue, but a rough diuell in heart: One that so smoothly swallowes his prey downe, Without wrath shewne, or any seeming frowne. You'd thinke him when he does't, in a Psalme, Or at his prayers, hee's so milde and calme: No noyse, no trouble to his conscience cryes, For he deuoures his prey with heau'd vp eyes. Stands most demurely swallowing downe his bit: And lickes his lips with long grace after it. This Bell wether (sit reu'rence) leades the flocke, After his sence grafted in errours stocke. This reu'rend Barrabas, a Button-maker, Himselfe with trusty Demas his partaker, Meets with their Brethren, Chore, Abiram, Dathan, And tearme our Church the Synagogue of Sathan. Wise Balaam, Nabal, Esau, Ismael, Tertullus, Theudas, and Achitophel, Phygellus, Himeneus, and Philetus, (A crew of turne-coates that desire to cheat vs) These fellowes with their ample folio graces, With mumping chaps, and counterfeited faces, Though they like shotten herrings are to see, Yet such tall Souldiers of their teeth they be, That two of them like greedie Cormorants, Deuoures more then sixe honest Protestants. When priuately a sister and a brother Doe meet, there's dainty doings with each other: There's no delay, they ne're stand shall I shall I, Hermogenes with Dallila doth dally: And Simei with Saphira will dispute, That nine moneths after she doth beare the fruite. When Zimri kissing Iezabel doth greet, And Cozbi with her brother Cham, oh sweet, 'Tis fit to trye (their humors to refresh) A Combate twixt the spirit and the flesh: Prouided that they doe it secretly, So that the wicked not the same espy: These youths deride the Surplesse, Crosse and Ring, The knee at Sacrament or any thing The Church holds Reuerend, and to testifie Their bastardy, the Fathers they deny. And of themselues they frame Religions new, Which Christ and his Apostles neuer knew; And with vntemper'd morter of their owne, They build a Church to all good men vnknowne, Railes at the Harmonious Organs, and the Coape. Yet in each Church of theirs, they raise a Pope, Cals it the badge of Antichristian drosse, When they see butter printed with the Crosse: And yet for coine they'l any man beguile, For when they tell it, they turne vp the pile, Vpon the Sabbath, they'l no Physicke take, Lest it should worke, and so the Sabbath breake. They hate to see a Church-man ride (who so) Because that Christ bad his Apostles goe. Against our Churches all, they haue exclaim'd, Because by Saints names most of them are nam'd: If these new Saints, no old Saints will abide, From Christendome they must, or run, or ride. Saint George from England chases them away, Saint Andrew doth in Scotland beare like sway: From Ireland good Saint Patricke them will banish, Saint Dennis out of France will make them vanish: Saint Iames will force them out of Spaine to fly, So will Saint Anthony from Italy, And last of all (whom I had halfe forgot) Saint Dauy out of Wales will make them trot. And what vngodly place can harbour then, These fugitiue vnnaturall Englishmen: Except that with the Turke or Infidell, Or on, or in the Sea, they meane to dwell, That if in lesser roome they may be cram'd, And liue and dye at Amster and be dam'd, And sure I hold some Romane Catholikes Much better then these selfe-wild Scismatickes, For Papists haue good affability, And some haue learning, most haue Charity, Except a Iesuit, whom I thinke a man, May tearme a right Papistick Puritan. And for the Sep'ratist I justly call, A Scismatick Jmpuritanicall. But yet the Jesuit's constant in his mind, The Scismatick is waueringly inclin'd. Besides he thinkes whilst he on earth doth liue. 'Tis charitie to take and not to giue. There are sort of men which conscience make, Of what they say, or doe, or vndertake: Who neither will dissemble, sweare, or lye, Who to good ends their actions all apply, Who keepe the Sabbath, and relieue the poore, According to their portions and their store: And these good people some men doe backbite And call them Puritanes, in scorne and spight, But let all know that doe abuse them so, That for them is reseru'd a fearefull wo; I loue and reuerence onely beare to such, And those that here inuectiuely I touch Are Birds whose Consciences are more vncleane Then any Cormorant was e're knowne or seene: Ile stand to'th censure of all honest men, If they disproue me, Ile ne're write agen. A Trust-breaker. The Argvment. A Foe to Iustice, a corrupted Friend, An outward Angell, and an inward Fiend; A hidden Serpent, a most subtile Fox, A Sugred poyson, in a painted Box: A Syrens song, alluring to mishap, A Snare to Honesty, and Vertues trap. The Rich Trust breaker, vpon whom hell waites Doth thrust into the Riuer of Estates, His soule deuouring Beake, and at one prey Will swallow fourteene Tradesmen in a day; As many of the Country Lordships slips Flapdragon like, by his insatiate lips, The Father sometimes hath beene oft vndone, By too much trusting his vnnaturall Sonne, And a Trust-breaker hath a tricke in's pate To bring a rich Ward to a Beggers flate. For some corrupted men haue got tuition, Of rich mens Heires, and changed their condition With false inducements to Recusancy, Or suffring them through prodigality To run so farre in debt that all their Lands Are lost before they come into their hands. Faire Schooles of learning haue bin built fr? ground For Boyes whose fathers were not worth fiue pound; But false Trust-breakers hold it for no sinne, To keepe out poore mens Sonnes, take rich mens in. This Breach of Trust is multiplide in time T' a Catholike and vniuersall crime, That man to man is growne so much vniust, That hee's a wise man that knowes who to trust. But (if there be such) they doe want much care, Who trust not in the world, nor trusted are. Collectorships the Common wealth may lurch, For Burnings, Highwayes, Bridges, or the Church, For losse at Sea, for Hospitals and Schooles, One hundred knaues, may make ten thousand fooles. Yet these things are so needfull as I wot, Hee's a base villaine that contributes not, But hee's a Hell-hound that their Trust deceiues, And the right due from those that want bereaues: Why, this Trust-breaking hath the ex'lent skill To make a Wife to burne her Husbands Will, Because his first Wiues Children should not haue The Portions that within that Will he gaue. And oftentimes a gasping man for breath, Distracted with the griping pangs of death, Hath to a forged will suscrib'd his hand, And dispossest his owne Sonne of his Land. Trust-breakers may a sencelesse hand so frame, (Though being sixe houres dead) to write a Name, A rich man's wealth that's dead's like vntold gold, And that's because it's neuer truely told: For like to pitch it hath polluting tricks, And some vnto the fing'rers fingers sticks: But of all Rascals since the world began, The Banckrupt Pollitick's the onely man, In courteous fashion many hee'l vndo, And be much pittyed and rewarded too: For hauing got much wealth into his clawes, He holds it faster then a Cormorants jawes Can hold a silly fish, and at the last, Himselfe, himselfe will into prison cast. And hauing broke for thousands, there the hound Compounds perhaps for ten groates in the pound, Sets richly vp againe till him he sees, To breake, to prison againe, againe agrees: And thus a cunning knaue can with a trice, Breake, and be whole againe, once, twice or thrice. These Cormorants are worse then theeues therefore, And being worse, deserue a hanging more. A Thiefe speaks what he means, and takes your purse A Banckrupt flattering robs you ten times worse. The one doth seldome rob ye of all your pelfe, The other leaues you nought to helpe your selfe: And yet the one for a little theeuing may, At Tiburne make a hanging holyday; Whilest the great Thiefe may with a golden prop To faire Reuenues turne a Pedlers shop. In this voracity Father stands not free From his owne Sonne, nor from his vnckle, he Being made Executor to'th Scates of men, My Corm'rant is a piddler to him then. He will by cunning and vexation draw, Heire, wealth and All, into his rauenous maw, And when his gorge is full vp to the brim, Into some loathsome prison vomits him. There leaues the honour of a house and name, To be exchang'd for miserie and shame: Now tell me they that loue faire truth indeed, If such mawes doe not Corm'rants guts exceed. And to what place soeuer such resort, They are the Fowle Birds both in Towne and Court. A Drunkard. The Argvment. A madnesse dearely bought with losse of fame, Of credit and of manly reputation: A cursed purchase of disease and shame, Of death, and a great hazard of Damnation: Jn all that's bad, the diuel's onely Ape, Worse then a beast, in the best manly shape. This fellow with the dropsie growne as big, And much more beastly then a Sow with pig, His cheekes like Boreas swolne, he blow'd and puft, His paunch like to a woolpack cram'd and stuft: And by the meanes of what he swil'd and gul'd, Hee look'd like one that was three quarters mul'd. His breath compounded of strong English Beere, And th'Indian drug would suffer none come neere. From side to side he staggered as he went, As if he reeling did the way indent. One skirt of's cloake scarce reacht vnto his waste, The other dragging in the dirt he trac'd. His very braines within his head were stew'd, And look'd so crimson colour'd scarlet hew'd, As 'twere an Jgnis fatuus, or a comet. His garments stunke most sweetly of his vomit. Fac'd with the tap-lash of strong Ale and Wine, Which from his slau'ring chaps doth oft decline, In truth he look'd as red as any coale, And bellied like vnto a mare with foale: With hollow eyes, and with the palsie shaking, And gouty legs with too much liquor taking. This valiant pot-leach, that vpon his knees Has drunke a thousand pottles vp se freese, Such pickled phrases he had got in store, As were vnknowne vnto the times of yore: As when he drinkes out all the totall summe, Gaue it the stile of supernagullum, And when he quaffing doth his entrailes wash, Tis call'd a bunch, a thrust, a whiffe, a flash: And when carousing makes his wits to faile, They say he hath a rattle at his taile, And when his wits are in the wetting shrunke, You may not say hee's drunke though he be drunke, For though he be as drunke as any Rat, He hath but catcht a Foxe, or whipt the Car. Or some say hee's bewitcht, or scratcht, or blinde, (Which are the fittest tearmes that I can finde. Or seene the Lyons, or his nose is dirty, Or hee's pot-shaken, or out, two and thirty. And then strange languages comes in his head, When he wants English how to goe to bed: And though t'were fit the swine should in his ftye be, He spewes out latine with prohibitibi. Which is, prouide for Tiburne (as I take it) Or if it be not, he may chance to make it. Then Irish Shachatwhorum from him flees, And halfe a dozen welch me Uatawhees: Vntill hee falls asleepe he skinks and drinkes, And then like to a Bore he winkes, and stinkes. This Cormorant in one day swallowes more, Then my poore Esacus doth in a score. For mine but once a day doth take his fill, The drunkard, night and day doth quaffe and swill, Drinke was ordain'd to length mans fainting breath, And from that liquor, Drunkards draw their death: Displeasing God, the diuell he onely pleases, And drinkes with others healths, his owne diseases. And in the end, contempt and shame's his share, The whil'st a Tapster is his onely Heire. Thus drinke's a wrastler that giues many a fall, To death, to beggery and slauish thrall. And drunkennesse a wilfull madnesse is, That throwes men to Hels bottomlesse abisse. For why, where Drunkennesse is mistris there, Sobriety can hardly maistry beare: And 'tis no question but the Land hath drown'd, More men with drinke, then Seas did e're confound. Wine is Earth's bloud, which from her breast doth spring, And (well vs'd) is a comfortable thing, But if abused from it then beginnes, Most horrible notorious crying sinnes. As Murther, Lechery, Ebrietie, Gods wrath, damnation in varietie: For hee that is a Drunkard, is the summe, And abstract of all mischiefes that can come. It wasts him soule and body, life and limb. My Cormorant's a sober beast to him. He that perswades a man to steale or lye, To sweare, or to commit adultery, To stab or murther any man that liues, Can it be said that hee good counsell giues? And hee that tempts and forces men to drinke, Perswades a man to damne himselfe, I thinke, For drunken men haue into dangers run, Which (being sober) they would ne're haue done. I take them for no friends that giue me Wine, To turne me from a man vnto a swine, To make me void of manners, sense, or reason, To abuse God, blaspheming odious treason, To hurt my soule and body, fame and purse, To get the diuell, and gaine Gods heauy curse. Though many take such for their friends to bee, I wish them hang'd that are such Friends to mee: For greater enemies there cannot dwell In the whole world, nor in the bounds of hell. Good friendly drinking I account not euill, But much carousing, which makes man a diuell, Wanting the priuiledge that hath a horse, And to be vrg'd and forc'd to drinke perforce. For why a horse this gouernment hath still, Drinkes what he will, and not against his will. And he that that good rule doth ouer-passe, Hath lesse discretion then a Horse or Asse, And any man that doth this temp rance want, Is a worse glutton then my Cormorant. A prodigall Country Gallant, and his new made Maddam. The Argvment. Taylors fooles, Times bables, and prides Apes, That as a Squirrell ships from tree to tree: So they like Porteus leape from shapes to shapes, Like foule swords in gilt scabberds, he and she Their carkasse pampers, gorgiously bedect, Whil'st their poore starued soules they both neglect. Now steps my young gull-gallant into play, Who (born to land) i'th country scornes to stay, To liue by wit (thankes Sire) he hath no need, And if he should be hang'd can scarcely reade. Drabs, dice, and drinke are all his onely ioyes, His pockets, and his spurs his gingling boyes, A Squirrels tayle hangs dangling at his eare, A badge which many a gull is knowne to weare. His eyes red-blood-shot, arguing a sod braine, His dam-him voice set to the roaring straine: His nose well inlaid with rich jemmes about, As from a watch-Towre, their heads peeping out, Attended fitly, (fitting for the age) With two shagg'd Russians and a pyde-coat Page, Who beares his boxe, and his Tobacco fils, With stopper, tongs, and other vtensils. This Fop, late buried er'e he came vp hither, His thrift and 's Father in one graue together, His Country stocke he sold, for that's the fashion, And to a Farmer gaue it new translation: His Fathers seruants he thrust out of doore, Allowes his mother but a pension poore: Salutes you with an oath at euery word, Sirha or slaue he liberall doth affoord. His Father (a good house-keeper) being dead, He scornes his honest blocke should fit his head: And though he be not skill'd in Magick Art, Yet to a Coach he turn'd his Fathers Cart, Foure Teames of Horses, to foure Flanders Mares, With which to London he in pomp repaires, Woo's a she Gallant, and to Wife he takes her: Then buyes a knighthood, and a maddam makes her. And yearely they vpon their backes oreweare, That which oft fed fiue hundred with good cheere. Whil'st in the Country all good bounty's spilt His house, as if a Iugler it had built, For all the Chimneyes where great fires were made, The smoake at one hole onely is conuey'd: No times obseru'd nor charitable Lawes, The poore receiue their answer from the Dawes, Who in their caying language call it plaine Mockbegger Manour, for they came in vaine. They that deuoure what Charitie should giue Are both at London, there the Cormorants liue, But so transform'd of late doe what you oan, You'l hardly know the woman from the man: There Sir Tim Twirlepipe and his Lady gay, Doe prodigally spend the time away; Being both exceeding proud, and scornefull too, And any thing but what is good they'l doe. For Incubus and Succubus haue got A crew of fiends which the old world knew not; That if our Grand-fathers and Grand-dams should Rise from the dead, and these mad times behold. Amazed they halfe madly would admire, At our fantasticke gestures and attire; And they would thinke that England in conclusion, Were a meere bable Babell of confusion. That Muld-sack for his most vnfashion'd fashions, Is the fit patterne of their transformations: And Mary Frith doth teach them modesty, For she doth keepe one fashion constantly, And therefore she deserues a Matrons praise, In these inconstant Moone-like changing dayes. A witlesse Asse (to please his wiues desire) Payes for the fewell, for her prides hot fire: And he and she will wast, consume, and spoyle, To feed the stinking lamp of pride with oyle: When with a sword, he gat a knightly name, With the same blow, his Lady was strucke lame. For if you marke it she no ground doth tread, (Since the blow fell) except that she be led: And Charity is since that time (some say) In a Carts younger brother borne away. These are the Cormorants that haue the power To swallow a Realme, and last themselues deuoure: And let their gaudy friends thinke what they will, My Cormorant shall be their better still. An Extortioner and a Broaker. The Argvment. Friends to but few, and to their owne soules worst, With Aspish poyson poysoning men at first, Who laughing languish, neuer thinke on death, Untill these Wolues (with biting) stop their breath; The diuell and they at no time can be sunder'd, And all their trade is forty in the hundred. Roome for two hounds well coupl'd, &amp; 'tis pitty To part them they do keep such ranck i'th City, Th'Extortioner is such a fiend that he Doth make the Vsurer a Saint to be, One for a hundreds vse doth take but ten, Th'other for ten a hundred takes agen: The one mongst Christians is well tollerated, Tother's of heauen and earth abhorr'd and hated, The one doth often helpe a man distrest, The other addes oppression to th'opprest. By paying vse a man may thriue and get, But by extortion neuer none could yet. Though vsury be bad, ('tis vnderstood, Compared with extortion) it seemes good. One by retaile, and th'other by the great, Ingrose the profits of the whole worlds sweat, That man is happy that hath meat and cloth, And stands in need of neither of them both. Extortioners are Monsters in all Nations, All their Conditions turne to Obligations, Waxe is their shot, and writing pens their Guns, Their powder is the Inke that from them runs. And this dank powder hath blowne vp more men In one yeare, then gun powder hath in ten. Bils are their weapons, parchments are their shields, With w?? they win whole Lordships, towns &amp; fields And for they know in heauen they ne're shall dwell, They ingrose the earth before they come to hell, Yet all their liues here they with cares are vext, Slaues in this world, and Hell-hounds in the next. And what they o're the diuels backe did win, Their heyres beneath his belly wast in sinne. The Broaker is the better senting Hound, He hunts and scouts till he his prey hath found, The gallant which I mention'd late before, Turning old. Hospitality out of doore, And hauing swallowed Tenants and their crops, Comming to towne, he crams Extortions chops: Craft there, may here againe be set to Schoole, A Country Knaue oft prooues a City Foole. He that a Dogs part playes when he is there. A Wolfe deuoures him when he comes vp here: The silly swaine the racking Landlord worries, But swaine and Landlord both extortion curries. First thing is done, the Broaker smels him forth, Hunts all his haunts, enquires into his worth: Sents out his present wants, and then applies, Rank poyson to his wounds for remedies. In stead of licking, hee's a biting whelpe, And rancles most, when he most seemes to helpe, And he hunts dry foot; neuer spends his throat Till he has caught his game, and then his note Luls him asleepe fast in Extortions bands There leaues him, takes his fee o'th goods and lands. And as he is the Common-wealths deceiuer, So for the most part, hee's the theeues receiuer. Hangs vp the hangmans wardrop at his doore, Which by the hang-man hath beene hang'd before. A fish-wise, with a pawne, doth money seeke, Hee two pence takes for twelue pence euery weeke: Which makes me aske my selfe a question plaine, And to my selfe I answer make againe: Was Houndsditch Houndsditch call'd can any tell, Before the Breakers in that street did dwell? No sure it was not, it hath got that name From them, and since that time they thither came: And well it now may called be Houndsditch, For there are Hounds will giue a vengeance twich. These are the Gulphes, that swallow all by lending, Like my old shooes, quite past all hope of mending: I'de throw my Cormorants dead into the pooles, If they cramm'd fish so fast as these eate fooles. A Basket-Iustice. The Argvment. The best of men, when truely exercis'd, The actor may a Saint be canoniz'd: Not Policy, but practise, Justice frames, Those whom bribes blinde, haue onely thred-bare names Of what they should be, thus the Land is blest, When judgements just flow from the Judges brest. Before the noyse of these two Hounds did cease, A Iustice (comming by) commanded peace: Peace Curres (qd. he) and learne to take your prey And not a word, so wise folkes goe your way: This is a youth that sued his place to haue, Bought his authority to play the knaue. And as for coine he did his place obtaine, So hee'l sell Iustice to mak't vp againe, For the old prouerbe fits his humor well, That he that dearely buyes must dearely fell. The sword of Iustice draw he stoutly can, To guard a knaue, and grieue an honest man, His Clarke's the Bee that fils his combe with honey, He hath the wit, his master hath the money. Such Iusticer as this (if men doe marke) Is altogether guided by his Clarke, He's the vice Iustice, he workes all by's wits, The whil'st his master pickes his teeth or spits, Walks, hums, and nods, cals knaue at euery turne, (As if he in a dawes nest had beene borne:) No other language from his worship flees, But Prisons, Warrants, Mittimus, and Fees: Commit before he search out the offence, And heare the matter after two dayes hence, Talkes of Recognizances, and hath scope, To binde and loose as if he were the Pope. Be the case ne're so good, yet build vpon't. Fees must be payd, for that's the humor on't. And thus with onely cursed wealth and beard, He makes a world of witlesse fooles afeard. And when he giues them but a smile or nod, They thinke this doughty else a demy-god. When fortune fals he knowes to vse the same, His Clarke and he as quiet as a Lambe, Make not two words, but share, &amp; go through stich, Here's mine, there's thine, for they know which is which, There hath beene, are, and will be still agen, In all professions some corrupted men: Before this branch of false Gebezaes Tribe, 'Tis sacriledge to call a bribe a bribe, Giue him a Bucke, a Pig, a Goose, or Phesant, (For manners sake) it must be call'd a present, And when hee's blind in Iustice, 'tis a doubt But Turkies tallons scratcht his eyes halfe out, Or Capons clawes, but 'tis a heauy case, That fowles should flye so in a Iustice face. Sometimes his eyes are goard with an Oxe horne, Or suddaine dasht out with a sacke of corne, Or the whiske brushing of a Coachmares taile To fit the Coach, but all these thoughts may faile, Some thinke they are but clouded and will shine, Eclips'd a little with a Teirce of Wine, Or onely falne into some hoodwink'd nap, As some men may vpon the Bench, by hap. But Iustice seemes deafe when some tales are told, Perhaps his Charity hath tane some cold, And that may be the cause, or rattling Coaching, Or neighing of horses to her gate approaching, From thence into the stable, as her owne: The certaine truth thereof is not yet knowne. But sure she is so deafe that she can heare, Nothing but what her Clarke blowes in her eare, Which Clark, good men must croach to, &amp; stand bare Or else small Iustice 'mongst them they shall share. His Master like a weather-cocke inclinde, As he doth please he makes him turne and winde. This Iustice of all sences is bereft, Except his feeling, onely feelings left: With which he swallowes with insatiate power, More bribes then doth my Cormorant fish deuoure. A Cutpurse. The Argvment. This is a mad knaue, liues by trickes and sleights. He diues by Land, and dies within the ayre: He serues no man, yet courteously he waites On whom he list, in Church, towne, throng or faire. He will not worke, yet is well cloath'd and fed. And for his farewell seldome dies in's bed. This Spirit, or this Ferrit next that enters (Although he be no Merchant) much he ventures. And though he be a noted coward, yet Most valiantly he doth his liuing get. He hath no weapon but a curtoll knife. Wherewith for what he hath he hazards life. East Indian Merchants crosse the raging Floods, And in their ventering, venter but their goods: When as themselues at hope securely sleepe, And neuer plow the dangerous Ocean deepe, If they doe lose by Pirates, tempests, rocks, 'Tis but a Fleabite to their wealthy stockes: Whilst the poore Curpurse day and night doth toile, Watches and wardes, and doth himselfe turmoile: Oft cuts a purse before the Sessions barre, Whilst others for their liues a pleading are, To Sturbridge Faire, or vnto Bristoll ambles In ieopardie he for his liuing rambles, And what he gets he doth not beg or borrow, Ventures his necke, and there's an end, hang sorrow. Whilst midst his perils he doth drinke and sing, And hath more purse-bearers then any King, Liues like a Gentleman by sleight of hand, Can play the Foist, the Nip, the Stale, the Stand. The Snap, the Curb, the Crosbite, Warpe and Lift, Decoy, prig, Cheat, (all for a hanging shift.) Still valiant where he comes, and free from care, And dares the stockes, the Whip, the Jaile out-dare. Speakes the braue canting tongue, lyes with his dell, Or pad, or doxi, or his bonny Nell, And liues as merry as the day is long, In scorne of Tyburne, or the ropes dingdong, But now a iest or two to minde I call, Which to this function lately did befall: A Cutpurse standing in a market-towne, As for his prey his eyes scowld vp and downe, At last he shoulders neare a Country Lasse, And cut her purse as by her he did passe. Shee spide and caught him, and began to raue, Call'd him rogue, rascall, villeyne, thiefe and slaue. Gep with a pox, the Cutpurse then replide, Are you so fine, you can no iesting bide, I'ue iested more with forty honest men, So with a moraine take your purse agen. Another sattin Cutpurse dawbd with lace, A Country Gentleman for's purse did chase, On whom a blew-coat Seruingman did wait, And passing through a narrow obscure strait, The thieuing knaue the purse he nimbly nims, And like a land-sharke thence by Land he swims. The Seruingman perceiu'd the Cutpurse tricke, Said nought, but dogges him through thin and thick, Vntill the thiefe suppos'd the coast was cleare, As he was pissing Blew-coat cut off's eare. The Cutpurse madly gins to sweare and curse, The other said, giue me my Masters purse, Which you stole lately from his pocket, then There's no wrong done, but here's your eare agen Thus though a Cutpurse trade be counted ill, I say he is a man of action still, Waites on Ambassadors that comes and goes, Attends at Tiltings and tryumphant showes At Westminster he still attendance giues, On my Lord Maior, his brethren and the Shrieues, Although vnbidden, yet hee'l be a guest, And haue his hand in sometimes with the best. And whil'st he liues, note how he takes degree, Newgate's his hall, at Tyburne he's made free: Where commonly it so falls out with him, He dyes in perfect health, sound winde and limbe, He in a Coaches elder brother rides, And when his soule and cordes from each diuides, He foules no sheets nor any Physicke takes, But like a Bird inth'ayre an end he makes: And such an end I wish they all may haue, And all that loue a shifting Cutpurse knaue, For they are Cormorants wheresoere they haunt, Vntill the Gallowes proues their Cormorant. A Good and a bad Constable. The Argvment. This man is to the Magistrate an eye, Reuealing things which Iustice could not finde. Blacke deeds of darkenesse he doth oft descry, And is (if he be honestly inclinde) So fit the Common-wealth in peace to keepe, By watching carefully whil'st thousands sleepe. VVh? Titan steeps his bright respl?dant beams And hides his burning Car i'th Westerne streams; Wh? to y? vnder world day takes his slight And leaues th'Horizon all in darknesse dight, When Philomell doth 'gainst a thorne proclaime In dulcet notes the lustfull Tereus shame, When Maddam Midnight shewes her Ebon face, And darkenesse doth the Hemisphere embrace, Then (to keepe all things peaceable and well, The watchfull Constable keepes centinell. Then if a man (with drinke) his wit hath left, Oh hath committed leachery or theft, Or murder, then the Constable thinkes fit That such committers straitly he commit. Hee's Lord high Regent of the tedious night, Man of the Moone he may be called right: Great generall of Glowormes, Owles, and Bats, Comptroler ouer such a whip the Cats. Dianaes Forrester that with regard, Doth guard the Heard that liues within his ward, His vigilancy is most manifest, For through his hornes he lightens all the rest. Like Minos, or iust iudging Rhadamant, He walkes the darkesome streets of Troynouant, Attended with his Goblins clad in Rugs, Like Russian Beares, or Phlegetonian bugs, Vntill Aurora shewes her blushing brow, And Lucifer doth shine, and cocks do crow, Madge howlet whooting hides her fearefull head, Then goes the Constable and's watch to bed. This officer in the first place I put, He that comes next is of another cut. Yet he's a member of the peace comes next, And writ most commonly an asse in Text: Image of office he is held to be And has his staffe tipt with authority, He has his bill-men which can hardly keepe The name of watchmen for they're still asleepe. His word is, Who goes there? Where doe you dwell? Stand still, and come before the Constable, Js this an houre: carry him to the Compter, goe: Sayes a man's drunke, when his owne case is so, But let a quar'ling slaue indeed goe by. Leading by th'arme his rampant venery, A thing of filthy surfet, like a swine, That scarce can goe laden with pox and wine, They for their sixpence shall passe by in state, The porter with a leg will ope the gate, Worship'd and guarded to their lodging safe, Not with Bils onely, but th'officious staffe, Whil'st the good sober man, that nothing gaue, Is strait committed for a dangerous knaue, Traytor to th'State, and in the I ayle must lye, Whil'st th'other's lighted to their lechery, This Constable may haue a trick in store, His house may be safe harbour for a whore, Because no man will offer to search there. She there may rest, and roost secure from feare. There she may lodge, and trade too if she will, As sure and safe as theeues are in a Mill, Or Suburbs for the birth of Bastards are, For all desire to lay their bellies there. Nay as a Compter for a Fellon's home, Or Ladies chamber for a Priest from Rome. But yet I say, 'tis not a matter hard, To finde an honest Constable in's ward, Trust forbid else, and waking watchmen to, Whose bils were neuer stolne, and much adoe To be corrupted with a villaines shilling, To wrong the good, and bad mens minds fulfilling. Such men as those I thinke some few there be, And for the rest, would they were hang'd for me. He when my Corm'rant is at rest, and thinkes, Poore fish no harme, nor ought that water drinkes, That's a night Corm'rant, and at midnight swils, Whole cans and pots, with Cheaters and their Iils, He makes all fish that comes into his net, Drinks drunke, and sleeps, and then the watch is set. A London Serieant and Jaylor. The Argvment. A brace of Hell hounds that on earth doe dwell, That tyrannize on poore mens bodies more. (If more they could, then diuels o're soules in hell: Whose musicke is the groanings of the poore. These when they buy their office, sell their soules, No Cormorants are such deuouring fowles. The Serieant I before the Jaylor name. Because he is the dog that hunts the game: He worries it, and brings it to the toyle, And then the Jaylor liues vpon the spoyle. I'ue knowne a Serieant that foure houres hath sate, Peeping and leering through a tauerne grate, His Yeoman on the other side the way, Keeping the like watch both for one poore prey: Wh? when they spide, like Mastiffs they come neere him And by the throat like cruell curs they teare him; If he hath money to the Tauerne straight, These sucking purse-leaches will on him wait; But if his stocke below, and's pockets dry, To th'Iayle with him, there let him starue and dye. Yet for all this a Serieant is deuout. For he doth Watch and prey much out of doubt. He sels no spice, and yet in euery place He's halfe a Grocer, for he liues by's mace: He's part a Gentleman, for vp and downe, Their steps he followes round about the towne. And yet he seemes a Iugler too by this, He oft from shape to shape so changed is: As sometimes like an Amsterdammian brother, Sometimes a Porters shape, sometimes another. Sometimes t'a Counsellour at law, and then, T'a lame and blinded begger, and agen T'a Country Seruingman that brings a Deere, And with these trickes his prey he doth come neere, Wherein he imitates the Diuell aright, Who can put on an Angels shape of light, That so his craft may on mens soules preuaile. So Serieants snare mens bodies for the Iaile, Time was, he wore a proper kind of coat, And in his hand a white rod as a note Whereby a man farre off a knaue might spy, And shun him if he were in jeopardy. But now to no such habit he is bound, Because his place ne're cost him eight score pound, To get the which againe, he must disguise And vse a thousand shifts and villanies. Oh that a man so little grace should haue To giue so much to be esteem'd a knaue. To be shau'd. duck'd, and vnpittyed dye, Curst and contemn'd within his graue to lye. To hazard soule and body, ne're to thriue, But by mens harmes, deuouring them aliue. To be the hang-mans guard, and wait vpon The Gallowes at an Execution, But yet the office is most fit to fee, And fit that honest men should haue it free. Now for the other sucking diuell, the Iaylor His work's brought to him, as he were a Taylor, As if he were a Fencer, he'll begin, And aske a man what Ward he will be in: (But first the Prisoner drawes without delay, A sop for Cerberus that turnes the key.) Then the old prisoners garnish doe demand, Which straight must be discharged out of hand, But if he cannot pay, or doth deny, He thrusts him in the hole, there lets him lye. If a good prisoner hath a well linde purse, The Iaylor then esteemes him as his nurse, Suckes like a Bulcalfe, and doth neuer cease Till with much griefe he heares of a release. An vnder-keeper, (though without desert) Is a continuall knaue in spight on's heart: If to the Prisoners he be sharpe and cruell, He proues their knaue, and his good masters Iewell: If vnto them himselfe he well behaue, He is their Iewell, and his masters knaue. So let him turne himselfe which way he can, He seldome shall be held an honest man. Perhaps the Jaylor in one stinking roome Hath sixe beds, for the Gallant and the Groome, In lowsie linnen, ragged couerlets: Twelue men to lodge in those sixe beds he sets: For which each man doth pay a groat a night, Which weekely's eight and twenty shillings right: Thus one foule dirty roome from men vnwilling, Draws yearely seauenty three pound sixteen shilling. Besides a Iaylor (to keepe men in feare) Will like a demi-diuill dominere: Reare like a Bearward, grumble, snarle, and growle, Like a Towre Cat-a-Mountaine stare and scowle. He and the Serieant may be coupled too, As bane of Mankind, for they both vndoe: Th'Extortioner and Broaker nam'd before, Hauing both bit and grip'd a mans state sore: In comes the Serieant for his breakfast then, Drags him to th'Iayle, to be new squeezd agen: And thence he gets not, there he shall not start, Till the last drop of bloud's wrong from his heart. Yet I haue heard some Serieants haue beene mild, And vsd their Prisoner like a Christians child; Nip'd him in priuate, neuer trig'd his way, As Bandogs carrion, but faire went away, Follow'd aloofe, shew'd himselfe kind and meeke, And lodg'd him in his owne house for a weeke. You'd wonder at such kindnesse in a man, So many Regions from a Christian, But what's the cause, Ile lead you out o'th maze, 'Tis twenty shillings euery day he stayes, Besides the Serieants wife must haue a stroake, At the poore teate, some outside she must soake, Although she tridge for't, whil'st good fortunes fall, He shall command house, Serieant, and all. Thus may it come by th' side o'th breeding woman, The Seriants Son's a Gentleman, no Yeoman. And whil'st they fish from mens decayes and wants, Their wiues may proue foule fleshly Cormorants. Thus a bad Serieant and a Jaylor both, Are Cormorants which all good people loath, And yet amongst them some good men there are, Like snow at Midsommer, exceeding rare. A Symonicall Patron, and his penny Clarke. The Argvment. Here Magus seeketh holy things to buy, With cursed bribes and base corrupting gold: Lets Soules for want of Preaching starue and dye, Fleeces and slayes his flockes, bare pill'd and pold: That to speake truth, in spight of who controls, Such Clarkes and Patron murther many soules. This is the bane both of the age and men, A Patron with his benefices ten; That wallowes in fat Liuings a Church-leach, And cannot keepe out of my Corm'rants reach, One of these Patrons doth deuoure his Clarks, As they doe perish Soules, after foure Markes, And euery yeare a paire of new high shooes, For which betwixt two Churches he doth vse Each Sabbath day with diligence to trot, But to what purpose, few or none know not. Except it be'cause would heeeate and feed, Hee'l starue two Cures, for he can hardly reade. This sir Iohn Lacklatine, true course doth keepe, To preach the Vestry men all fast asleepe, And boxe and cuffe a Pulpit mightily. Speaking non-sence with nose-wise grauity, These youths, in Art, purse, and attire most bare Giue their attendance at each steeple faire; Being once hir'd he'l not displease his Lord, His fully Patron, nor dares preach a word, But where he giues the text, and that must be Som place of Scripture bites no vsury, Extortion or the like, but some calme Law, That will not fret his fore be't nere so raw. As calmely preach'd, as lamely too expresse't, With clamarous yell that likes the Parish best. This Clarke shall be a drudge too, all his time, Weeds in the garden beares out dung and slime: Then vpon Sabbath dayes the scroyle beginnes With most vnhallowed hands, to weed vp sinnes: And from cup filling all his weeke dayes spent, Comes then to giue the Cup at Sacrament. And from his trencher waiting goes to serue Spirituall food to those that almost starue; And what's this Clarke that's of such seruile minde, Some smarting Pedant, or mechanicke hinde, Who taking an intelligencers place, Against poore tenants first crept into grace, And drudges for eight pounds a yeare perhaps, With his great vailes of Sundayes trencher scraps. This makes the sacred Tribe of Leui glad, That many of them proue the Tribe of Gad. This makes good Schollers iustly to complaine, When Patrons take they care not who for gaine, When as a Carter shall more wages haue, Then a good Preacher that help s Soules to saue, These Cormorants Gods part doth eate and cram, And so they fare well, care not who they damne, The people scarce know what a Sermon meanes, For a good Preacher there can haue no meanes, To keepe himselfe with cloathes, and book &amp; bread Nor scarce a pillow t'vnderlay his head. The whil'st the Patrons wife (my Lady Gay) Fares, and is deckt most dainty euery day: Shee'l see that preaching trouble not the towne, And weares a hundred Sermons in a Gowne. She hath a Preachers liuing on her backe, For which the soules of many goes to wracke, And hires a mungrell cheaply by the yeare, To famish those, Christs bloud hath bought so deare: What greater cruelty can this exceed, Then to pine those whom Iesus bids them feed, These are hels vultures, Tophets greedy fowles, That proue (like diuels) Cormorants of Soules. A Country Yeoman. The Argvment. Here Dauy Dicker comes, God speed the Plough, Whose Sonne's a Gentleman, and hunts and hawkes: His Farme good cloathes and seeding will allow, And whatso'ere of him the Country talkes, His Sonne's in silkes with feather in his head, Untill a Begger bring a Foole to bed. The Romane Histories doe true relate, How Dioclesian chang'd his Emp'rors state, To liue in quiet in a Country Farme, Out of the reach of treasons dangerous arme. Then was a Færmer like a lab'ring Ant, And not a Land deuouring Cormorant. For if a Gentle man hath Land to let, He'l haue it, at what price so'ere 'tis set, And bids, and ouer bids, and will giue more. Then any man could make of it before: Offers the Landlord more then he would craue, And buyes it, though he neither get nor saue. And whereas Gentlemen their Land would let, At rates that tenants might both saue and get, This Cormorant will giue his Landlord more, Then he would aske, in hope that from the poore He may extort it double by the rate, Which he will sell his corne and cattle at. At pining famine he will ne're repine, 'Tis plenty makes this Cormorant to whine, To hoard vp corne with many a bitter ban, From widowes, Orphanes, and the lab'ring man, He prayes for raine in haruest, night and day, To rot and to consume the graine and hay: That so his mowes and reeks, and stacks that mould, At his owne price he may translate to gold. But if a plenty come, this rauening thiefe Torments &amp; sometimes hangs himselfe with griefe. And all this raking toyle, and carke and care, Is for his clownish first borne Sonne and heyre, Who must be gentled by his ill got pelfe, Though he to get it, got the diuell himselfe. And whil'st the Fathers bones a rotting lye, His Sonne his cursed wealth, accurst lets flye, In whores, drinke, gaming, and in reuell coyle, The whil'st his fathers Soule in flames doth broyle. And when the Father on the earth did liue, To his Sonnes fancie he such way did giue, For at no season he the plow must hold, The Summer was too hot, the Winter cold, He robs his mother of her Butter pence. Within the Alehouse serues him for expence. And so like Coles.dog the vntutor'd mome, Must neither goe to Church nor bide at home. For he his life another way must frame, To Hauke, to hunt, abusing the Kings game, Some Nobleman or Gentleman that's neere, At a cheape rate to steale what they call deere. When if a poore man (his great want to serue) Whose wife and children ready are to starue, If he but steale a sheepe from out the fold, The chuffe would hang him for it if he could. For almes he neuer read the word releeue, He knowes to get, but neuer knowes to giue, And whatso'ere he be that doth liue thus. Is a worse Cormorant then my Æsacus. A Figure-flinger, or a couz'ning Cunning-man. The Argvment. Amongst a foolish, faithlesse, gracelesse, crew, This man hath better credit then Gods word: For losse that's past, or profit to ensue, Like to a Tearme, with Customers he's stor'd, Hee's a Soothsayer, but sayth seldome sooth, And hath the Diuels great seale for what he doth. Here now I draw a curtaine and discouer, Amongst all knaues, the diuels speciall louer: One that doth Court him still, and daily woe, And faine would see the diuell but knowes not how, He has him in his workes, that's his sure place, But has not art to bring him to his face, When he could wish him to his outward sense, The diuell sits laughing in his conscience: Yet you shall haue this figure-flinger prate, To his gull client (small wit shællow pate,) As if he were Lord warden of hell sire, And Lucifer and he had both one sire. The Fiends his couzen Germanes (once remou'd) From earth to hell, where he is best belou'd. More fustian language from his tongue doth drop, Then would set forth an honest tradesmans shop: As if that all Magitians that e're were, Vnworthy were his learned bookes to beare. Nor Zoroastres King o'th Bactrians, Nor the sage Magi of the Persians, Nor any coniuring Sonne of Cham or Chus: Nor Faustus with his Mephostophilus, Cornelius, Agrippa, Simon Magus, Nor any twixt the Riuer Thames or Tagus, Nor Britaines Bladud, Cambriaes Merlin, Bacon, Companions for this man would ne're be taken. For he is rare, and deeply read indeed, In the admir'd right reuerend old wiues Creed, Talkes of the Iewish Thalmud, and Cabals, Solstitiums and Equinoctials, Of auguries, of prophesies, predictions, Prognostications, reuelations, fictions. And as he could the Elements command, He seemes as he their minds doth vnderstand. By Fire he hath the skill of Pyromanty, By Ayre he hath the Art of Heremanty, By Water he knowes much in Hidromanty, And by the Earth hee's skill'd in Geomanty, Palme Chiromanty, couz'ning Necromancy, To gull the world, to fulfill fooles fancie, Hags, ghosts,and goblins, furies, fairies, clues, He knowes the secrets of the diuels themselues. There's not a Nimph, a fawne, or goat-foot Satyre, That liues by Fire, by Aire by Earth, or Water, Nor Driades or Hamadriades, Betwixt Septentrio and Meridies, But he commands them to doe what they list, If he but bend the brow, or clutch the fist. He'le tell a mans hearts secrets what he thinkes, Like Oedepus vnfolds th'ambiguous Sphinx, With skill surpassing great Albumazers, He with intelligencing Fiends confers, And by his wondrous Attacoesticon, Knowes the Turkes counsell, and what Prester John Determines, or what businesse she now befals Amidst the Conclaue of Romes Cardinals. He can release, or else increase all harmes, About the necke or wrests by tying charmes. He hath a tricke to kill the Agues force, And make the patient better; or much worse, To the great toe, three letters he can tye, Shall make the Gowt to tarry or else flye. With two words and three leaues of foure-leau'd grasse He makes the tooth-ach, stay, repasse, or passe: If lost goods you againe would faine haue got, Goe but to him, and you shall speed, or not. But he will gaine whether you get or lose, He'le haue his Fee, for so the bargaine goes: He'le tell you wonders when you are alone, Of the Philosophers admired stone: And that it from Vtopia first did come, Brought to him by a Spirit, he sent to Rome, Whereby (t'inrich the world hee dares be bold) To turne pans, pots, and dripping pans to gold. And in the Goldsmith's burnisht glistring row, Place Ironmongers with a fairer show, Turne Spits and Andir'ns to bright mettle shining, That when coine's scarce you straight may put to coining, These and a thousand more, as idely vaine Fooles swallow, and hee swallowes them againe, And though the marke of truth he neuer hits, Yet still this Cormorant doth liue by's wits, And ne're will want a false deuouring tricke, Till hells Archcormorant deuoure him quicke. A Corrupted Lawyer, and a knauish Vndershriue. The Argvment. The soule of Common-wealths is in good Lawes, Their execution makes a happie State, But where Corruption opes his hungry Jawes; Where Lawyers doe increase, not cease debate, Such Law-wormes are the Diuels dearest brood, Who make the common-harme their priuate good. A hall, a hall, the tramplers are at hand, A shifting Master, and as sweetly man'd: His Buckram-bearer, one that knowes his ku, Can write with one hand and receiue with two. The trampler is in hast, O cleere the way, Takes fees with both hands cause he cannot stay, No matter wheth'r the cause be right or wrong, So hee be payd for letting out his tongue. Me thinkes that posie which the Painters score Vpon Inne posts, would fit this fellowes doore, Because he lets his Conscience out for fee, That here's a Tongue that's let at liuery. This pettifogger, like a Lapland Witch, Sels his winde deare, and so growes diuellish rich: Breath is his life, and deare he'le sell his breath, The more he wastes, the nearer is his death. To begger any man he will not straine His voyce, except they pay him for his paine. He best doth fare where Clients fare the worse, And euery meale hath first and second course, The dishes that come first vp to the messe, Are Brawles and quarrels, strife, vnquietnesse, Contentions, emulations, and debate, These furnish forth his table in great slate. And then for picking-meat, or daintie bits, The second course is Actions, cases, writs: Long Suits from Terme to terme, and Fines and fees, At the last cast comes in for Fruit and cheese. The man of all men, most in art excel'd, That in Great Britaine would Contention geld, And by that meanes could make a good preuention, Contention would beget no more contention. This Lawyers riches euer springs and bloomes, From sheeps coat, calues skin, russet hobnaild grooms Perswading them that all things shall goe well, Suckes out the Egge, leaues them the emptie shell, He hath a sleight in spinning out a Cause, Till all the money out of purse it drawes, His Clients with full budgets come to towne, But he takes order for their going downe, The full is now the Lawyers, theirs the wane, Like buckets turn'd to come vp full againe: With papers laden thinke themselues most firme, Carries them downe, to bring them vp next terme, Horse plow, and cattle goe to wracke, split all, Tis fit the Stable waite vpon the Hall. Their sheepe the parchment beares, their Geese the quils, Which turnes their state as this bad Lawyer wils. Their shirts the paper makes, their Bees the wax, T'vndoe themselues that good discretion lacks, These men like Geese against themselues doe things, In plucking quils from their owne foolish wings, This Lawyer makes his dang'rous shafts withall, And shootes them at the fooles fr? whence they fall. The Common-wealths Impostum hee doth cut, And the corruption in his purse doth put, One giues him for a bribe, a Brawne or swine, And thats drown'd with anothers But of wine, One giues a Coach all deckt and painted gay. Anothers Horses drawes it quite away, One giues a Jarre of Oyle to scape the foile, An Oxe o'returnes the Iarre, and spils the Oyle. And thus like Pharaohs Kine, he hath the power, To make the fattest bribes the leane deuoure. His motions moue commotions, and his suites, Foure times a yeare doe Termely yeeld him fruits. Foure sundry wayes a Kingdomes Lawes are vs'd, By two maintained, and by two abus'd: Good Lawyers liue by Law, and 'tis most fit, Good men obey the Law, liue vnder it. Bad Lawyers (for their gaine) doe wrest the Law, Bad men of God or mans Law haue no awe. But whether these men vse Law well or ill, Th'intention of the Law is honest still. For as the text is rent, and torne, and varied, And by opinions from the fence is carried By ignorant and wilfull Hereticks, Or impure separating Schismaticks, Though from the truth of text all men should seuer, The text is permanent and Sacred euer. Euen so the Law is in it selfe vpright, Correcting and protecting, wrong and right: Tis no just Lawyers, or the Lawes defame, Although some hounds of hell abuse the same. This Cormorant I meane, gulps whom he list, And hauing swallow'd fees into his fist, Deferres the motion till the Court with-drawes, Then to the cushions pleads the poore mans cause, As formally as if the Iudges sate, No matter for the man, the money's gat. My Cormorant was neuer match'd till now, If I said o'rematch'd, Ile resolue you how, And you that reade it shall confesse it true, Perhaps it is a thing well knowne to you, Where Corm'rants haunts, numbers of fish grow lesse, But where bad Lawyers come, there brawles increase. Now master Undershrieue I vnderstand, You bring my Lawyer worke vnto his hand, You bring him stuffe, hee like a Taylor cuts it. And into any shape hee pleaseth puts it. Though to the Client it appeare slight stuffe, It shall out-last him any suite of Buffe: For though from terme to terme it be worne long. Tis drest still with the teazle of the tongue, That (though it be old) at euery day of hearing, It lookes fresh, as't had neuer come to wearing. And though it seeme as th'owner neuer wore it. A Broaker will not giue him three-pence for it. Sweet master Shrieue, let it not grieue your mind, You being the last o'th brood, come last behind, No doubt you might be first in a bad case, But being call'd vnder, I make this your place: I know where e're you stand, you are so good, You'l scorne to be vnlike one of the brood, And tak't in dudgeon (as you might no doubt) If 'mongst this ranke of Corm'rants you were out. I haue a warrant heere for what I doe, Plaine truth it selfe, and that haue seldome you. Some of your tribe a man may honest call, But those my Corm'rant meddles not withall. You that dare fright men of a shallow wit, Who cannot read when there is nothing writ: And can returne (when you are pleas'd to saue) A Non inuentus for a bribing knaue. For one that stands indebted to the King A Nihil habet, if his purse can ring. When a poore man shall haue his Bullockes ceaz'd, And priz'd at little, to make you appeaz'd You haue the art and skill to raze words out Of Writs and Warrants, to bring gaine about. I will not serue you so, for if you looke, Your name stands fairely printed in my booke, For euery one to reade, how you can straine On Widowes goods, and restore none againe. Picke Iuries for your purpose, which is worse Then if you pick'd the wronged Plaintiffes purse: Returne your Writs to your aduantage best, Bring in some money, and drab out the rest. Leauing (oft times) the high Shrieue in the lurch, Who stops the bountie should repaire the Church, Or buy some Bels to sound out his deuotion. If either Ayre, or Earth, or the wide Ocean Can shew worse Cormorants, or any brooke, I'le neuer aske a penny for my Booke. Epilogve. Now Reader, tell me (if thou well canst judge) If any honest man haue cause to grudge At these my Satyres, being plaine and true, Giuing the world and the Diuell their due.

TAYLORS WATER-WORKE: OR, THE SCVLLERS TRAVELS, FROM TYBER TO THAMES: VVITH his Boat laden with a Hotch-potch, or Gallimawfrey of Sonnets, Satyres, and Epigrams.

Sum primus homo, Vis ire mecum Remis? Est mihi proximus Cimba. DEDICATED To neither Monarch, nor Miser, Keaser nor Caitiffe, Pallatine or Plebeian; but to great Mounsier Multitude, alias, All, or euery One; Iohn Taylor sends his Scull-boats lading, to be censured as please their Wisedomes to screw their Lunatike opinions. To the Right Worshipfull and my euer respected Mr. Iohn Moray Esquire. Of all the wonders this vile world includes, I muse how flatterie such high fauours gaine. How adulation cunningly deludes, Both high and low from Scepter to the swaine; But if thou by flatterie couldst obtaine More then the most that is possest by men, Thou canst not tune thy tongue to falshoods straine, Yet with the best canst vse both tongue and pen. Thy sacred learning can both scan and ken The hidden things of Nature and of Art, 'Tis thou hast rais'd me from obliuions den, And made my Muse from obscure sleepe to start. Vnto thy wisdomes censure I commit, This first borne issue of my worthlesse wit. J. T. To my deere respected friend, Maister Beniamin Johnson. Thou canst not dye for though the stroake of death Depriues the world of thy worst earthly part: Yet when thy corps hath banished thy breath, Thy liuing Muse shall still declare thy Art. The fatall Sisters and the blessed Graces, Were all thy friends at thy Natiuitie: And in thy mind the Muses tooke their places, Adoring thee with rare capacitie. And all the Worthies of this worthy Land, Admires thy wondrous all-admired worth, Then how should I that cannot vnderstand Thy worth, thy worthy worthinesse set forth? Yet beare the boldnesse of the honest Sculler, Whose worthlesse praise can fill thy praise no fuller. I. T. To my louing Friend Iohn Taylor. Could my vnpractis'd pen aduance thy name, Thou shouldst be seated on the wings of Fame. For from thy toylesome Oare I wonder I, How thy inuention flowes so iooondly? Not hauing dream'd on faire Pernassus Hill, With fruitfull numbers to enrich thy Quill. Nor hauing washt in that Pegassion Fount, Which lends the wits such nimblenesse to mount With tickling rapture on Poetique straines, On Thames the Muses floate that fils thy braines. Thy happy wit produc'd thy happy rimes, Which shall commend thee vnto after times. And worthily enroll thy name 'mongst those, Whose Temples are begirt, with Lawrell bowes. For (sooth to say) a worke I saw not yet, Lesse helpt with learning, rnd more grac'd with wit: Then spight of enuie and detractions scorne, Though Art thou want'st, thou art a Poet borne: And as a friend for names-sake I'le say thus, Nec scombros metuentia, Carmina nec thus, Hen: Taylor. To the one and onely water-Poet and my Friend, Iohn Taylor. Fresh-water Souldiers saile in shallow streames, And Mile end Captaines venture not their liues, A braine distempred brings forth idle dreames, And gelded Sheathes haue seldome golden Kniues, And painted faces none but fooles bewitch: Thy Muse is plaine: but witty, faire: and rich. When thou didst first to Aganippe float, Without thy knowledge (as I surely thinke) The Nayades did swim about thy boat, And brought thee brauely to the Muses brinke, Where Grace and Nature filling vp thy Fountaine, Thy Muse came flowing from Pernassus Mountaine. So long may flow as is to thee most fit, The boundlesse Ocean of a Poets wit. I. P. In laudem Authoris. Wit, Reason, Grace, Religion, Nature, Zeale, Wrought all together in thy working braine And to thy worke did set this certaine seale; Pure is the colour that will take no staine. What need I praise? the worke it selfe doth praise: In words, in worth, in forme and matter to, A world of wits are working many wayes, But 'few haue done, what thou dost truly doe: Was neuer Tailor shapt so fit a Coat, Vnto the Corps of any earthly creature, As thou hast made for that foule Romish Goat, In true description of his diuellish nature. Besides such matter of judicious wit, With quaint conceits so fitting euery fancie; As well may proue, who scornes and spights at it Shall either shew their folly or their franzie, Then let the Popes Buls roare, Bell, Booke &amp; Candle. In all the Diuels circuit sound thy curse: Whilst thou with ttuth dost euerie tryall handle. God blesse thy worke, and thou art ne're the worse. And while hels friends their hateful so do proue thee, The Saints on earth, &amp; God in heauen will loue thee. Thy louing friend Nicholas Breton. [VVhen Tybers siluer waues their Channel leaue] VVhen Tybers siluer waues their Channel leaue, And louely Thames, her wonted course forsake, Then foule obliuion shall thy name bereaue, Drenching thy glory in her hell bred lake, But till that time this scourge of Popery, Shall crowne thy fame with immortality. Thy friend assured Maximilian Waad. To my louing Friend Iohn Taylor. Ferris gaue cause of vulgar wonderment, When vnto Bristow in a boat he went; Another with his Sculler ventured more, That row'd to Flushing from our English shoare. Another did deuise a woodden Whale, Which vnto Callice did from Douer saile, Another with his Oares and slender Wherry, From London vnto Antwerpe o're did Ferry. Another maugre fickle fortunes teeth, Rowed hence to Scotland and arriu'd at Leeth. But thou hast made all these but triuiall things, That from the Tower thy watry Sculler brings To Hellicon: most sacred in account, And so arriued at Pernassus Mount: And backe return'd Laden with Poets wit, With all the Muses hands to witnesse it; Who on their Sculler doth this praise bestow, Not such another on the Thames doth row. Thy louing Friend, Sam: Rowlands. To my Friend both by Water and Land, Iohn Taylor. Oft hast thou trauail'd for me at thy Oare, But neuer in this kind didst toyle before. To turne a Poet in this peeuish time, Is held as rare as J should write in rime, For one of thy profession, yet thy Art, Surpasseth mine, this serues to paint that part, J meane thy Poetry which in thee lurks, And not thy sweating skill in water-works. I cannot but commend thy Booke, and say Thou merit'st more then common Scullers pay: Then whistle off thy Muse, and giue her scope, That she may soundly cease vpon the Pope: For well J see that he and many more, Are dar'd by her (which scarce was done before.) Proceed (good Iohn) and when th'ast done this worke, Feare not to venter trassing of the Turke. I like thy vaine, J loue thee for those guifts Of Nature in thee, farre aboue the shifts That others seeke, plodding for what thy pen, Wit workes in thee learning in other men. Thou Natiue Language we haue done thee wrong To say th'art not compleat, wanting the tongue Call'd Latine, for heere's one shall end the strife, That neuer learned Latine word in's life. Then to conclude, J truly must confesse, Many haue more beene taught, but learned lesse. Thy assured friend R. B. To my louing Friend Iohn Taylor. Some say kind Iacke thou art a Poet borne, And none by Art; which thou maist justly scorne; For if without thy name they had but seene Thy lines, thy lines had artificiall beene, Opinion carries with it such a curse, Although thy name makes not the verse the worse. If then this worke, variety affords Of Trophes, of Figures, Epethites, and Words. With no harsh accent and with iudgement too. I pray what more can Art or Nature doe? So that in thee thy Genius doth impart, To Artificiall Nature, Naturall Art. Thy old assured friend Io: Moray. Prologue to the Reader. Good gentle Reader, if I doe transgresse, I know you know, that I did ne're professe, Vntill this time in Print to be a Poet: And now to exercise my wits I show it. View but the intrals of this little booke, And thou wilt say that I some paines haue tooke: Paines mixt with pleasure, pleasure ioyn'd with pain Produc'd this issue of my laboring braine. But now me thinkes I heare some enuious throat, Say I should deale no further then my Boat: And ply my Fare, and leaue my Epigram, Minding, ne Sutor vltra crepidam. To such I answere, Fortune giue her guifts. Some downe she throwes, and some to honour lifts: 'Mongst whom from me she hath with-held her store And giues me leaue to sweat it at my Oare. And though with labour I my liuing purse, Yet doe I thinke my lines no iot the worse, For Gold is gold though buried vnder mosse, And drosse in golden vessels is but drosse. Iohn Taylor. To Tom Coriat. VVhat matters for the place I first came from I am no Duncecomb, Coxecomb, Odcomb Tom Nor am I like a wool-pack, cr?m'd w?? Greek, Uenus in Uenice minded to goe seeke; And at my backe returne to write a Volume, In memory of my wits Gargantua Colume. The choysest wits would neuer so adore me; Nor like so many Lackies run before me, But honest Tom, I enuy not thy state, There's nothing in thee worthy of my hate; Yet I confesse thou hast an excellent wit: But that an idle braine doth harbour it. Foole thou it at the Court, I on the Thames, So farewell Odcomb Tom, God blesse King James. The Author in his awne defence. There is a crew of euer carping spirits, Who merit nothing good, yet hate good merits: One wrings his lawes a wry, and then cryes mew, And that I stole my lines, hee'l plainely shew. Thou addle-headed Asse, thy braines are muddy, Thy witlesse wit, vncapable of study, Deem'st each inuention barren, like to thine, And what thou canst not mend thou wilt repine. Loe thus to wauering Censures torturing Racke, With truth and confidence my Muse doth packe. Let Zoylus and let Momus doe their worst, Let Enuie and Detraction swell and burst; In spight of spight and rankerous disdaine, In scorne of any carping Criticks braine, Like to a Post I'le runne through thicke and thin, To scourge Iniquity and spurgall sinne. You worthy fauourites of wisedomes lore, Onely your fauours doth my Muse implore: If your good stomackes these harsh lines disgest, I carelesse bid a rush for all the rest. My lines first parents (be they good or ill) Was my vnlearned braine, and barren quill. THE SCVLLER. To the whole kennell of Anti-Christs hounds, Priests, Friers, Monkes, and Jesuites, Mastiffes, Mongrels, Islands, Spanniels, Blood-hounds, Bobtaile-tike, or Foysting-hound: The Scvller sends greeting. Epigram 1. [Cvrse, exorcise, with Beads, with Booke and Bell] Cvrse, exorcise, with Beads, with Booke and Bell Polluted shauelings: rage and doe your worst: Vse coniurations till your bellies burst, With many a N gromanticke mumbling spell, I feare you not, nor all your friends that fell With Lucifer: yee damned dogs that durst Deuise that thundring Treason most accurst, Whose like before was neuer hatcht in Hell, Halfe men, halfe diuels, who neuer dream'd of good, To you from faire and sweetly sliding Thames, A popomasticke Sculler warre proclaimes, As to the suckers of Imperiall bloud, An Anti-Iesuite Sculler with his pen, Defies your Babell beast, and all his Den. I. T. Epigram 2. [Rome, now approaches thy confusion] Rome, now approaches thy confusion, Thy Antichristi? Kingdome down must tumble The Nimrods proud cloud-piercing Babylon, Like hell-hatch'd pride, despight thy hart must humble, In scorne of damn'd equiuosation, My lines like thunder through thy Regions rumble, Downe in the dust must lye thy painted glory, For now I row and write thy tragicke story. Epigram. 3. [Wh? God had all things out of nothing fram'd] Wh? God had all things out of nothing fram'd, And man had named all things y? are nam'd; God shewed to man the way he should behaue him, What ill would dam him, or what good would saue him, All creatures that the world did then containe, Were all made subiects to mans Lordly raigne. Faire Paradise was Princely Adams walke, Where God himselfe did often with him talke; At which the Angels, enuious and proud, Striu'd to ascend aboue the highest cloud: And with the mighty God to make compare, And of his glory to haue greatest share: Because they saw Gods loue to man so great, They striu'd to throw their Maker from his seat. But he, whose power is All-sufficient, Did headlong hurle them from Heauens battlement: And for which enuious pride they so did swell, They lost heauens glory for the paines of Hell. In all this time, man liuing at his ease, His wife nor he not knowing to displease Their glorious maker, till the Sonne of night Full fraught with rage, and poyson bursting spight, Finding alone our ancient grandam Eve, With false perswasions makes her to beleeue If she would eate the fruit she was forbidden, She should Gods secrets know, were from her hidden Supposing all was true the Serpent told, They both to Adam straightway did vnfold, This treacherous horrid vile soule-killing treason, And he ambitious, past the bounds of reason, (To his posterities sole detriment) Doth to the Woman and the Fiend consent. Yet Adam neuer had the diuell obeyed, Had he not had the woman for his ayde. Lo thus the sexe that God made man to cherish, Was by the Diuell intic'd to cause him perish. Sathan supposing he had wonne the field (In making man to his obedience yeeld) Poore Adam now in corps and mind deiected, From head to foot with shamefull sinne infected: Is now a slaue to sinne, the Diuell and Death, Dreading the danger of th'Almighties wrath. From Eden banisht, from Gods presence thrust, And all the earth being for his crime accurst, Opprest with griefe and selfe-consuming care, Being at the brimme of bottomlesse dispaire. Yet God in mercy thinking of his frailtie, Though sinfull man to him had broken fealtie, Did promise he would send his onely Sonne, To satisfie for faults by man misdone. At last he came, in his appointed time, And on his faultlesse shoulders tooke our crime, And like a malefactor death he suffered, And once for all, himselfe himselfe hath offered. And yet the Diuell will not be satisfi'd, (Although the Sonne of God for sinners dy'd) But dayly hellish damned enterprises, His Ministers and he 'gainst man deuises, Vnder the shelter of Religions cloake, Seditiously he doth the world prouoke, 'Gainst God in trayterous manner to rebell, To amplifie his euerlasting hell, Attempting mankind still by fraud or force, His soule from his Redeemer to diuorce, And yet not man alone must feele his sting, But he dares venter on our heauenly King, Whose power though Satan knowes is euerlasting, Yet after fortie dayes and nights long fasting, Thinking him weake, attempts now to inuade him: And with illusions seeking to perswade him: Carries our Sauiour vp vnto a Hill, And told him if he would obey his will. In adoration to fall downe before him, He of the worlds great glory would so store him That he should Lord and Master be of all, If he in reuerence would before him fall. Christ knowing him to be the root of euill, With God-like power commands, auoid thou diuell. 'Tis writ, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God, But serue and feare the fury of his rod, Sathan perceiuing all his labour lost, Runnes through the world, more swifter then a post: Proclaimes large Kingdomes, and a tryple Crowne, To him that in his Reuerence would fall downe. Ambitious thirst of fickle fading fame, Did quickly mindes of wordly men inflame: Making them dreame on pleasures transitorie, And to esteeme earths pompe aboue heauens glory. This made the Pope, with poysonous pride infus'd, T'accept those honours Christ before refus'd: Now hath he wonne great fame, on this condition: That fore the diuell he fall in base submission: So hauing wonne this great magnificence, To countermaund the earths circumference: The Idiot world he proudly ouer-swayes, Vnder the name of Heauens immortall kayes, O're all the Globe he raignes as Lord and King, And to Hels Goat fold aye doth millions bring, Of soules, seduc'd with buzard blinded zeale, From men besotted he doth honour steale. And yet with his effrontit shamelesse face, Seemes to command the diuell that gaue him place. A haynous fault in my dull vnderstanding, The Seruant o're his Lord should be commanding: But yet I thinke 'tis but for policy, More to increase th'infernall Monarchy: He seemes to hate the Diuell he most doth serue, Else would the world from Romes obedience swerue, And leaue the Pope and Papists in the lurch: And then might Sathan whistle for a Church, The Isle of Brittaine hath perceiu'd their tricks, And in Rebellion 'gainst the Pope she kickes: For whom they haue inuented hell-hatcht plots, Quite to extirpe the English and the Scots. I wot not which of Rome or hell roar'd lowder, But they had like t'haue pepper'd vs with powder. Yea all estates, from Scepter to the Crowne, Should topsie turuie all be tumbled downe. Without respect of person, sexe, or age, All had their doome, t'abide the Romane rage. But he that by his sacred selfe had sworne, To guard his Church, did laugh them all to scorne: For when those vassals of eternall night, Thought all secure, then God brought all to light, Casting their painted glory in the dust, That any power besides his power doth trust: Leauing their Corps a prey for Crowes and Kites, That brauely so for Signior Satan fights. But in this matter I'le no further trauaile, Least want or water make my Ship to grauell: Knowing there's many wits of farre more worth, That to the life hath limbd this Treason forth; But Ile conclude as I began before, Because that Christ would not the diuell adore, Christ lost this glorious worldly pompous raigne, Which happy losse, the haplesse Pope did gaine. Epigram 4. [How weakly is that weake Religion grounded] How weakly is that weake Religion grounded, That thinks y? Church on Peters corps is fo?ded? The Spouse of Christ is built on Faiths firme Rocke, Which not the fury of Hels direfull shocke, Though all the fiends in troupes doe her assaile. Yet 'gainst Gods power their force cannot preuaile. Peters confessing Christ Gods Math. 16. If the Corps of Peter be the Churches foundation, as the Papists faine, then how should the Spouse of our Sauiour haue done, if the Apostle Peter had neuer beene borne. true begotten, Is sure the Churches ground, but Peter's rotten. Or else if Peter neuer had had life, Through want of him Christ neuer had had wife. For 'tis an Article of Faith profound, To know S. Peter for the Churches ground. And who denyes it shall haue fire and rope, Beleeue me Reader, or goe aske the Pope. But yet I muse in what place of the earth, Gods Church did stand before S. Peters birth? Epigram 5. [VVhen as our Sauiour to the Temple went] VVhen as our Sauiour to the Temple went, To tell the message that his Father sent: And finding there a rude vnruly rout, That bought and sold, he angry beat them out, And ouerthrew their Tressels and their Tables, And made them packe away with all their bables: And further said (what all true hearts beleeues) This house was made for Prayer, no den for theeues. Those Marchants thus whipt from their market place Practis'd reuenge 'gainst Christ for this disgrace. And more to str?gth their power, joyn'd w?? y? Pope: Who by his lawlesse Law hath giuen them scope, That in the Church they still should buy and sell Both God, and Diuell, Heauen, Purgatory, Hell. Now here's the oddes, Christ out the Pedlers thrust, And stayd himselfe there, preaching what was iust. And for reuenge the haughty Romane Priest. Hath tane the Pedlers in, and thrust out Christ. Epigram 6. [It is a question farre beyond my Logicke] It is a question farre beyond my Logicke, How those y? haue y? Popedome won by Magicke, Can be Lieutenants Tis more then I can beleeue that the Diuell hath power to elect an officer for God. Being of the Diuels placing or displacing, the Pope must needs be the diuels deputy and not Christs. vnto Christ our Sauiour, Being knowne for hell-hounds of most damn'd behauiour: Then since the diuell hath the Pope created, His Vicar must he be, that there him seated: 'Twould make a wiser head then mine to muse, That God should like the man the Diuell doth chuse. Epigram 7. [A prouerbe old, where had the Diuell the Fryer?] A prouerbe old, where had the Diuell the Fryer? Where had the Diuell the Fryer but were he was? The Diuell with the Fryer sits in the Quire, The Fryer with the Diuell sayes and sings Masse? The diuell and the Frier are ne're asunder, The Fryer to hate the Diuell is more then wonder. Epigram 8. [Conferring with a Romish] Conferring with a Romish I my selfe did talke with such a fellow, and if occasion serue, I can produce him. Pharisee, Who void of grace maintain'd this heresie, That he the Law of God had neuer broken, Nor neuer ill had done, nor ill had spoken. I gaue his Antichristian faith the lye. And told him that for him Christ did not dye. For be did suffer onely for their sinne, Who were insnared in the diuels ginne. And as for him that neuer had transgrest, Twere good to hang him now he's at the best. Epigram 9. [It is an Art beyond the worke of Nature] It is an Art beyond the worke of Nature, The Pope should be Tis a rare piece of worke for the pot to make the Potter. Creator, and a Creature: Betwixt the Pope and God there's one thing odde, For though God all things made, y? Pope makes God. Epigram 10. [Religions scatter'd into diuers sects] Religions scatter'd into diuers sects, One likes one way for many sound respects. Others like that way; others like another, And what likes th'one, is loathed by the other. Yet each man deemes his owne opinion's right, And each 'gainst other beares inated spight. Amongst the rest the Romane Catholike, Who scornes that his Religion saile should strike To any, since from it two vertues springs, That they may eate their God, and kill their Kings; By which maine Maximes they do strongly hope To the worlds Period to vphold the If the diuell be true to his Seruants, these two principall Axiomes will to the end of the world helpe the Papists at a dead lift. Pope. Epigram 11. [It is no wonder though Romes regall sway] It is no wonder though Romes regall sway, Is by a Sheapheard rul'd with Tis a reason a Shepheard should rule Rome, because a Shepheard did build it: and it stands by great reason, the Pope should bee of a woluish nature, because a Wolfe was nurse to his first predecessor Romulus. Lordly same; For ancient Records truly doth display; How Romulus the Shepheard built the same: And how his brother Remus and himselfe, In Tybers restlesse waues ydrencht and duckt, When infant miserie was all their pelfe, A rauening wolfe, most motherly they suckt: From whom doth spring as from a flowing gulfe, Romes Priest and Prince, a Shepheard and a Wolfe. Epigram 12. [Tvmultuous thoughts within my brest doth struggle] Tvmultuous thoughts within my brest doth struggle, To thinke how finely popish Priests can iuggle: And make the world beleeue a a wafer Though all the Scriptures doe affirme that the corporall presence of Christ is in heauen from whence he will not come in his bodily forme, till hee comes to the eternall iudgement: yet a shaueling Priest, will dayly take vpon him to command him downe, and to iuggle him into the shape of a Cake, or a piece of bread. Cake, Is that Creator that did all things make Or that the sinne-polluted bald-crownd Priest, With coniurations, can create his Christ, When our beliefe doth plainly testifie, He sits at Gods right hand in Maiestie, From whence in humaine forme he will not come, Till quicke and dead shall all abide his doome. What Fooles are they then thinks the Priest &amp; Baker, With impious hands makes their immortall maker. Epigram 13. [Not all the sophistrie of Aristotle] Not all the sophistrie of Aristotle, Cannot perswade me but the Pope did erre, When he and's sonne mistooke the poysned Alexander the 6, and his sonne Cæsar Borgius, were both poysoned in mistaking their liquor. But if his Holinesse had beene in Peters Chayre, he could not haue erred in such a matter. bottle. 'Twas 'error sure, what euer they inferre. O't had beene good then, both for him and's heyte, He had beene haltered fast in Peters Chayre. Epigram 14. [The warlike Emperours before Christ come] The warlike Emperours before Christ come, Subdu'd the world, both Sea and Land to Rome. Then afterwards the Heauen, Earth, sea, and Land being all wonne before these latter times by the Emperours and the godly Bishops, there remaines onely Hell for the Pope to make a lawfull claime vnto. Heauens their Bishops wonne. By preaching truly Gods immortall Sonne. Heauen, Earth, and Sea, being taken in the prime, What rests now for the Popes this latter time? Since of the heauens and earth they loose their part, They will haue hell, despight the diuels hart. Epigram 15. [Christs Church in no wayes is the] Christs Church in no wayes is the That Church that is so oposite to the doctrine of Christ cannot be Christs wife but the deuils whore. Church of Rome For Paul sayes, in the latter time should come, Apostates, that the truth should quite forsake, That lyes and fables should Religion make: Affirming meates and Matrimony euill, Which Paul doth call the doctrine of the deuill. Then since the Pope and all his shaueling rout, What Christ commands they wilfully thrust out. I with my betters must conclude this doome, The Deuils deere drab must be the Church of Rome. Epigram 16. [O yes, if any man would know a place] O yes, if any man would know a place, Where God himselfe hath neither power nor might, Where as th'Almighty neuer shew'd his face. Where words, not swords, can neither talke nor fight. O such a placelesse place is, God made heauen and earth, the Sea, and all things contained in them: the Pope made Purgatory without Gods leaue or knowledge, therefore it is no reason that God should haue anything to doe there without the Popes leaue. Purgatory, Created by the Pope without Gods leaue, To amplifie his Antichristian glory, And all the world with cunning to deceiue, Where as the Pope hangs, drawes, condemnes, and iudges Commits, acquits, sets free, or casts in thrall, Whether he thousands sends, on heapes like drudges, For in this no place, hee is all in all, And like a mighty three-crownd Priestly Prince, With threats and bans he so the world bewitches: In sending thither, and recalling thence, He gaines himselfe the Diuell and all for riches. Epigram 17. [The ] The His holinesse domineeres ouer all the deuils in this life, but tis but borrowed ware, for they pay him all his old score when hee dyes, and comes to Plutoes host. Pope hath charge of heauens immortall keyes, And triple-headed Cerberus obeyes, His triple Crowne, and who so e're he please, He sends to Hell for payne, or Heauen for ease. He can command the Angels and the Fiends, What pleases them for him or for his friends, Like as a Dog doth feare a flitch of Bacon, So his great name, Heauen, Earth, &amp; Hell hath shaken. Epigram 18. [VVho dares affirme the Popes of Rome are Proud] VVho dares affirme the Popes of Rome are Proud, Amongst the Heretickes himselfe must shroud: Or who dares say they'r giuen to Auarice, In selling Heauen and Hell for summes of price? Or who dares speake such words of treachery, To say the Pope is giuen to Seauen goodly vertues naturally ingrafted in his hellish Holinesse. Letchery? Or who is he, dares be so impious, To say his Holinesse is Enuious? Or who, for feare of euerlasting scath, Dares once accuse his Holinesse of Wrath? Or who is he that dares once verisie, The Pope doth vse excessiue Gluttony? Or who dares say, that like a drone or moath, Like an vnpreaching Priest, he liues by Sloath? He that against him this dares justifie, Is a plaine Protestant, and such am I. Epigram 19. [May it be call'd intollerable Pride] May it be call'd intollerable Pride, For man to sit in the His holinesse neuer learned this of Christ, nor yet of Peter. Almighties seate, Or on mens shoulders pompously to ride, To terrifie the world with thundering threat? To weare a three pilde Crowne vpon his head? To haue both Kings and Princes at his becke? Whose Horse by mighty Potentates is led, Who proudly footes vpon the Emperours necke: If trickes like these, for pride may be allow'd, Then I conclude, the Pope must needs be proud. Epigram 20. [If it be couetous for gripple gaine] If it be couetous for gripple gaine, To sell the Heauens, the Earth, yea God himselfe, To dispossesse Kings from their lawfull raigne, To cramme his coffers with vnlawfull pelfe. To pardon sinnes for If you wil know the price of sinne, any ordinary Priest can tell you, as well as Tom Tapster can tell a penny is the price of a pot of Ale. money, more then pitty: Nay more, to pardon sinnes that are to come: To maintaine Whores, and Stewes in Towne and City: Who yerely payes the Pope a countlesse sum, Who takes great interest, puts great summes to vse, 'Tis Couetousnesse I thinke without excuse. Epigram 21. [Is it not bruitish sensuall] Is it not bruitish sensuall Why may not his Holinesse haue as much priuiledge as a Beast, for a beast may lawfully ingender with his owne kindred, and the Pope is called a Beast in many places of the Bible. appetite, The Sire to make a strumpet of his child, Or is not Letcherie an Epethite, For him that hath his Fathers bed defilde? For him that hath deflour'd Virginitie? That hath defilde the Damozell and the Damme, Without respect of Consanguinitie? That like a wolfe hath spoyld both Ewe and Lambe? This may be tearm'd incestuous Luxury, And yet his Holinesse not wrongd thereby. Epigram 22. [He like a God that gouernes in the world] He like a God that gouernes in the world, That Envies each mans honour but his owne: He that sedition through the earth hath hurld, Whose Enuie hath great Kingdomes ouer-throwne. He that vngraues his foe, that's once intomb'd, For Enuie that he wrong'd him whilst he liu'd, And after death is Enuiously doom'd. To be of liuelesse sencelesse limbs depriu'd. If this be true none will deny I hope, That Enuie is ingrafted in the Pope. It is too true, that the Pope enuying the glory of other Princes, hath by fraud or force gotten all the earthly glory to himselfe. Pope Stephen the 6, caused the dead body of his predecessor Formoses to be digged vp, &amp; to be cut and mangled, and cast into the Riuer Tyber. Epigram 23. [He whose fierce] He whose fierce Those that remember the powder Treason can tell if I lye or not, besides many horrible murthers committed by Popes, which are extant in many learned Authors of their owne sect. Wrath with bloudy rage doth swell, That takes delight in slaughtering Gods elect: He that is sworne the Champion of Hell. That Wrath and Murther onely doth effect: He whose combustious all-deuouring ire, Depopulates and layes whole Empires waste, Whose Wrath like a consuming quenchlesse fire, Hath blessed peace from Christendome displac't. If I should need one, skild in Wrath and Murther, His Holinesse commands me goe no further. Epigram 24. [VVho dares for] VVho dares for It is a pittifull pining gluttonous fast, to refraine flesh and care all manner of fish, and other Delicates, which they cause to swim in their bellies with the strongest Wine, which makes his Holinesse and all his crew to looke as leane as so many Brawnes styed vp against Christmas. Glutony the Pope accuse, Or 'gainst voluptuous dyet make complaints? His Holinesse so many Fasts doth vse, As Lents, and Fasting-dayes, and Eeues of Saints, Yet where Pride, Lust, and Auarice are found, Heart gnawing Enuie, and fell murthering Wrath, There rauenous Gluttony must needs abound, Else other vices will be out of breath. For Papists Fasts are generally more deare, Then Feasts of Protestants with all their cheare. Epigram 25. [Those ] Those I meane the seuen deadly sinnes, liberall Sciences in number seauen, Began with Pride, &amp; ends with drowsie Sloath, Yet Christs command vnto the Apostles giuen Was, feed my sheepe that faith in them haue growth. Now I suppose, the feeding of Christs flocke, Is truly Preaching of his sacred word, Which word's the Key that opes the heauenly locke, Which If the Pope should suffer this sword to be drawne, it would cut his throat, and his Maiesties both. Sword and Word his Holinesse doth hoord. Which drawne, cuts his throat and the Diuels both, For feare of which he lets it sleepe in sloath. His Holinesse knowes if he should feed the Sheepe of Christ with such food as he commanded, they would soone finde out his knauery. Epigram 26. The beliefe of a Romane Catholike. [I doe beleeue the holy Pope of Rome] I doe beleeue the holy Pope of Rome, Is Lord of I would wish that this were not so, but I need not stand long in perswading men to beleeue it, for their owne Authors will testifie this, and a hundred times more. Scriptures, Fathers, Church and all: Of Councels of the world, whose dreadfull doome, Can at his pleasure make all rise, or fall. I doe beleeue, though God forbids the same, That I should worship Images, and Saints: I hope by mine owne workes I heauen may claime. In tongues vnknown, I must make praiers &amp; plaints. I doe beleeue Christs bodie made of bread. And may be eaten by Dogs, Cats, or Mice, Yet is a sacrifice for quicke and dead, And may be bought and sold for rated price. I further doe beleeue the Pope our Lord, Can at his pleasure all my sinnes forgiue. I doe beleeue at his commanding I thinke as you thinke, what thinke you? word, Subiects must Kings of liues and land depriue. Like as the Church beleues, so I beleeue: By which I hope the Heauens I shall atchieue. Epigram 27. [Like as the Vipers birth's his mothers bane] Like as the Vipers birth's his mothers bane, So the Popes full, hath been the Emperors wane: The Empires Autumne, was the Popish Spring, And Kings subiection made the Pope a King. Then did his Holinesse become a God, When Princes children-like, gan feare his rod. Whil'st earthly Potentates their owne did hold, The Popes then Shepheard-like did keepe their fold. And fore the sacred truth should be o'ercome, They willingly would suffer Martyrdome. But farewell Martyrs now, and welcome Myters, For painefull Preachers now, contentious fighters, With bloud or gold, ascends the Papall Chayre, Vnder the title of Saint Peters heyre. I thinke if truth were brought vnto the tryall, The Pope is heyre to Peter in denyall. But want of penitence proclaimes him base, A Bastard not of Peters blessed race, Vnlesse when Christ did call th'Apostle diuell, He's Bastard to the good, and heyre to th'euill. Epigram 28. [Me thinkes I heare as warme of Romanists] Me thinkes I heare as warme of Romanists, Reuile and curse, with Candle, Booke &amp; Bell: Yea all the polteshorne crew of Antichrists, Condemnes me all without remorse to Hell: But I with resolution so doe arme me, Their blessings doe no good, nor cursings harme me. Epigram 29. [I that haue rowed from Tyber vnto Thames] I that haue rowed from Tyber vnto Thames, Not with a Sculler, but with Scull and braines, If none will pay my Fare, the more's their shames, I am not first vnpaid that hath tane paines. Yet Ile bee bold if payment be delay'd. To say and sweare your Sculler is not pay'd. To his approued good friend, Master Robert Branthwayt. Deere friend, to thee I owe a countlesse debt, Which though I euer pay will ne're be pay'd: Tis not base coyne, subiect to cankers fret, If so, in time my debt would be defray'd, But this my debt, I would haue all men know, Is loue, the more I pay, the more I owe. I. T. To his well esteemed friend, Master Maximilian Waad. VVit, Learning, Honesty, and all good parts, Hath so possest thy body and thy minde, That couetously thou steal'st away mens hearts, Yet 'gainst thy theft, there's neuer none repin'd. My heart, that is my greatest worldly pelfe, Shall euer be for thee as for my selfe. J. T. To my friend Master William Sherman. Thou that in idle adulating words Canst neuer please the humours of these dayes, That greatest workes with smallest speech affords, Whose wit the rules of Wisedomes lore obeyes. In few words then, I wish that thou maist be, As well belou'd of all men, as of me. I. T. FJNJS. Epigram 1. [All you that stedfastly doe fixe your eye] All you that stedfastly doe fixe your eye, Vpon this idle issue of my braine, Who void of any intricate disguise, Describes my meaning rusticall and plaine. My Muse like Sisiphus with toylesome trade, Is euer working, yet hath neuer done, Though from the Romish Sea she well gan wade, Yet is her labour as 'twere new begun. For hauing at the Papists had a fling. Great Britaines vice, or vertues now I sing. Epigram 2. [Then cause I will not hug my selfe in sinne] Then cause I will not hug my selfe in sinne, First with my selfe, I meane for to begin. Confessing that in me there's nothing good: My vaines are full of sinne-polluted bloud, Which all my corps infects with hell-borne crimes, Which make my actions lawlesse like these times, That had I power according to my will, My faults would make compare with any ill. But yet I muse at Poets now adayes, That each mans vice so sharpely will dispraise: Like as the Kite doth o're the carrion houer, So their owne faults, with other mens they couer. Cause you shall deeme my judgement to be just, Amongst the guilty, I cry guiltie first. Epigram 3. [Glacus that selfe conceited criticke foole] Glacus that selfe conceited criticke foole, Vpon my Epigrams doth looke a scaunt, And bids me put my barren wit to Schoole, And I in anger bid the Asse auaunt. For till some better thing by him is pend, I bid him fault not that he cannot mend. Epigram 4. [A skilfull Painter such rare pictures drew.] A skilfull Painter such rare pictures drew. That every man his workemanship admir'd: So neere the life, in beautie, forme, and hew, As if dead Art, 'gainst Nature had conspir'd. Painter sayes one, thy wife's a pretty woman, I muse such ill-shape Children thou hast got, Yet makest such pictures as their like makes no man, I prethee tell the cause of this thy lot? Quoth he, I paint by day when it is light, And get my Children in the darke at night. Epigram 5. [Vnlearned Azo, store of Bookes hath bought] Vnlearned Azo, store of Bookes hath bought, Because a learned Scholler hee'l be thought: I counsell'd him that had of Bookes such store, To buy Pipes, Lutes, the Violl and Bandore, And then his Musicke and his learning share, Being both alike, with either might compare. Epigram 6. [Faire Betrice tuckes her coats vp somewhat hie] Faire Betrice tuckes her coats vp somewhat hie, Her pretty leg and foot cause men should spie: Sayes one you haue a handsome Leg sweet ducke, I haue two (quoth she) or else I had hard lucke: There's two indeed, I thinke th'are twinnes (qd, he) They are, and are not, honest friend (quoth she) Their birth was both at once, I dare be sworne, But yet betweene them both a man was borne. Epigram 7. [The way to make a Welch-man thirst for blisse] The way to make a Welch-man thirst for blisse, And say his prayers dayly on his knees: Is to perswade him, that most certaine 'tis, The Moone is made of nothing but greene Cheese. And hee'l desire of God no greater boone, But place in heauen to feed vpon the Moone. Epigram 8. [A gallant Lasse from out her window saw] A gallant Lasse from out her window saw, A Gentleman, whose nose in length exceeded. Her boundlesse will, not limited by Law, Imagin'd he had what she greatly needed. To speake with him, she kindly doth entreat, Desiring him to cleare her darke suppose: Supposing euery thing was made compleat, And correspondent equall to his nose. But finding short where she expected long, She sigh'd and said, O nose thou didst me wrong. Epigram 9. [Young S?. John Puckefoist, and his new made Madam] Young S?. John Puckefoist, and his new made Madam: Forgets they were the off-spring of old Adam. I'm sure 'tis not for wit, nor manlike fight, His worthlesse worship late was dub'd a Knight. Some are made great for wealth, and some for wit, And some for valour doe attaine to it: And some for neither valour, wit nor wealth, But stolne opinion, purchase it by stealth. Epigram 10. [One told me flattery was exil'd the state] One told me flattery was exil'd the state, And pride and lust at Court were out of date, How vertue did from thence all vice pursue, 'Tis newes (quoth I) too good for to be true. Epigram 11. [He that doth beate his braines, and trie his wit] He that doth beate his braines, and trie his wit, In hope thereby to please the multitude, As soone may ride a Horse without a bit, Aboue the Moone or Sunnes high altitude. Then neither flatterie, nor the hope of pelfe, Hath made me write, but for to please my selfe. Epigram 12. [A rusticke swaine was cleauing of a blocke] A rusticke swaine was cleauing of a blocke, And hum he cryes at euery pond'rous knocke, His wife sayes, Husband, wherefore hum you so? Quoth he, it makes the wedge in further goe. When day was done, and drowsie night was come, Being both in bed at play, she bids him hum. Good wise (quoth he) entreat me hum no more, For when I hum I cleaue, but now I bore. Epigram 13. [VVhen Caualero Hot shot goes with Oares] VVhen Caualero Hot shot goes with Oares, Zoun's row ye Rogues, ye lazy knaues make hast, A noyse of Fidlers and a brace of Whores, At Lambeth stayes for me to breake their fast; He that's so hot for's wench ere he come nie her, Being at her once, I doubt hee'l be on fire. Epigram 14. [It was my chance once in my furious mood] It was my chance once in my furious mood, To call my neighbours wife an arrant whore, But she most stifly on her credit stood, Swearing that sorry I should be therefore. Her Husband vnderstanding of the case. Protested he would sue me for a slander, When straight I prou'd it to his forked face, He was a Knaue, a Cuckold and a Pander. O to (quoth he) good neighbour say no mo, I know my wife lets out her buggle bo. Epigram 15. [The Law hangs Theeues for their vnlawfull stealing] The Law hangs Theeues for their vnlawfull stealing, The Law carts Bawds, for keeping of the dore, The Law doth punish Rogues, for roguish dealing. The Law whips both the Pander and the Whore, But yet I muse from whence this Law is growne, Whores must not steale nor yet must vse their owne. Epigram 15. [Old Fabian by Extortion and by stealth] Old Fabian by Extortion and by stealth, Hath got a huge Masse of ill gotten wealth, For which he giues God daily thankes and praise, When 'twas the Diuell that did his fortunes rayse. Then since the getting of thy goods were euill, Th'hast reason to bee thankfull to the deuill, Who very largely hath increast thy mucke, And sent the Miser Midaes golden lucke. Then thanke not God, for he hath helpt thee least, But thanke the Diuell that hath thy pelfe increast. Epigram 17. [What matter ist, how men their dayes doe spend] What matter ist, how men their dayes doe spend, So good report do on their deaths attend, Though in thy former life thou ne're didst good, But mad'st Religion for thy faults a hood, And all blacke sinnes were harbour'd in thy brest, And tooke thy Conscience for their natiue nest: Yet at thy buriall for a noble price, Shalt haue a Sermon made, shall hide thy Vice, A thread bare Parson shall thy praise out-poure And in the Expiration of an houre Will make the world thy honesty applaud, And to thy passed life become a Bawd. Our Christian Brother here lyes dead (quoth he) Who was the patterne of true Charitie. No Drunkard, Whoremonger, nor no vile swearer, No greedy Vsurer, nor no Rent rearer. O deare beloued, this example take, And thus an end at his time doe I make. Thus Mr. Parson nobly spends his breath, To make a Villaine honest after death. And for one Noble, freely he affords, Much more then twenty shillings-worth of words. Epigram 18. [Lord who would take him for a pippin Squire] Lord who would take him for a pippin Squire, That's so bedaub'd with lace and rich attire? Can the dam'd windfals of base baudery, Maintaine the slaue in this embrodery? No maruaile Vertue's at so low a price, When men knowes better how to thriue by Vice. Epigram 19. [All Bradoes oathes are new sound eloquence] All Bradoes oathes are new sound eloquence, As though they sprung from learned Sapience: He sweares by swift-pac'd Titans fiery Car, By Marses Launce, the fearfull God of war, By Cupids Bow, Mercuries charming Rod, By Bacchus Diety, that drunken God. By grim fac'd Pluto, and Auernus Caues, By Eolus blasts, and Neptunes raging Waues, By his sweet Mistris bright translucent eyes, All other Oathes his humour doth despise. Epigram 20. [Signeor Serano to and fro doth range] Signeor Serano to and fro doth range And at high Noone he visits the Exchange: With stately gate the peopled Burse he stalkes, Prying for some acquaintance in those walkes; Which if he spye, note but his strange salute, Marke how he'l spread to shew his broaking sute, When he perhaps that ow'd that cast apparell, Not a fortnight since at Tyborne fought a quarrell. Epigram 21. [Old Grubsons Sonne a stripling of good age] Old Grubsons Sonne a stripling of good age, Twill make one laugh to see him and his Page, Like to a garded Vrchin walkes the streets, Looking for reuerence of each one he meets: Eagles must honour Owles, and Lyons Apes, And wise men worship fooles for farre fetcht shapes; Epigram 22. [Great Captaine Sharke doth wonderfully muse] Great Captaine Sharke doth wonderfully muse, How he shall spend the day that next ensues: There's no Play to be playd, but he hath seene, At all the Theaters he oft hath beene: And seene the rise of Clownes, and fall of Kings, Which to his humour no contentment brings. And for he scornes to see a Play past twice: Hee'l spend a time with his sweet Cockatrice. Epigram 23. [A compleat Gallant that hath gone as farre] A compleat Gallant that hath gone as farre, That with his hands from skyes hath pluckt a star: And saw bright Phœbus wh? he did take Coach: And Luna when her throne she did approach: And talkt with Iupiter and Mercury, With Vulcan and the Queene of Lechery. And saw the net the stumpfoot Black-smith made, Wherein fell Mars and Venus was betrayd, With thousand other sights he saw in skyes, Who dares affirme it that this gallant lyes? I counsell all that either hate or loue him. Rather beleeue him, then goe to disproue him. Epigram 24. [Drusus his portion gallantly hath spent] Drusus his portion gallantly hath spent, What though? He did it to a good intent. Vnto a wise man it seemes neuer strange, That men should put their mouey to Exchange. Nay then I saw he was a subtile Fox, What had he for't I pray, sweet Sir the Poxe. I doe not like his bargaine: why, wherefore? His mony still wan'd lesse, his poxe waxe more. He need not now feare wasting of his stocks. Spend what he can, he nere shall want the Poxe. Epigram 25. [Neate Master Scape-thrift, railes against all ryet] Neate Master Scape-thrift, railes against all ryet, Commending much a temperate sparing dyet: What though he hath beene prodigall and wilde, Those idle fancies now he hath exilde: What though he hath beene frequent with excesse Of Dice, of Drabs, and drowsie Drunkennesse, Yet now he's chang'd Sir, he is not the man, The case is alter'd now from what 'twas than: The Prologue of his wealth did teach him spend, And 'tis the Epilogue that makes him mend. Epigram 26. [A greedie Chuffe once being warn'd in poste] A greedie Chuffe once being warn'd in poste To make appearance at the Court of Hell: Where grisly Pluto hotly rules the roste. And being summon'd by the passing Bell. With heapes of gold he would haue bribed Death, But he disdaining bribes depriu'd his breath. Epigram 27. [Doctor Donzago one of wondrous learning] Doctor Donzago one of wondrous learning, And in Astronomy exceeding cunning: Of things thats past and c?ming he's discerning, His mind on Prophesies is euer running, Of Comets, Meteors, Apparitions, Of Prodigies, and exhalations, Of Planets, natures, and conditions, And of the spheares great calculations, Yet want of one skill all his cunning smothers, Who lyes most with his wife himselfe or others. Epigram 28. [Braue Bragadocia whom the world doth threaten] Braue Bragadocia whom the world doth threaten, Was lately with a Faggot. sticke fore beaten: Wherefore in kindnesse now my Muse must weepe, Because his resolution was asleepe. Epigram 29. [Walking along the streets the other day] Walking along the streets the other day, A ragged Souldier crost me on the way; And though my purses lyning was but scant, Yet somewhat I bestow'd to ease his want. For which he kindly thankt me with his heart, And tooke his leaue, and friendly we did part. When straight mine eyes a Horse &amp; Footcloth spy'd, Vpon whose backe in pompous state did ride, One, whom I thought was deputie to Ioue, Yet not this Souldiers wants could pitty moue, But with disdainefull lookes and tearmes of scorne, Commands him trauaile whether he was borne. 'Twill almost make a Puritan to sweare, To see an Asses Horse a cloake to weare. When Christians must goe naked bare and thin, Wanting apparell t'hide their mangled skin. Vaine world vnto thy Chaos turne agen, Since brutish beasts are more esteem'd then men. Epigram 30. [Lieutenant Puffe from Cleaueland is return'd] Lieutenant Puffe from Cleaueland is return'd, Where entring of a breach was sorely burn'd: And from reuenge hee'l neuer be perswaded, Till the low Countries he hath quite inuaded. When his hot wrath makes Neatherlands to smoke, He's bound for Deepe in France with irefull stroke. But haue a care in these hot warres of France, Least in a Pockie heat you spoyle your Lance. Epigram 31. [A loue-sicke Wooer would a Sonnet write] A loue-sicke Wooer would a Sonnet write, In praise of her that was his hearts delight; Hoping thereby his wished loue to win, And to attaine it, thus he did begin. Starre of the Earth, and Empresse of my Soule, My Loue and Life, that doth my thoughts controule: Sole Queene of my affections and desire, That like to Ætna, sets my heart on fire. Thy Golden Lockes, resembling brightest Amber, Most fit to grace some mighty Monarkes Chamber: Thine eyes Eclipsing Titan in his rising, Thy Face surpassing Natures best deuising, Thy lips euaporates most sweet perfumes, Thy voice the Musicke of the Spheares assumes. Perfection wounds more then Loues shaft and Bow, Thy red the Rose doth shame, thy white the Snow, Thou Worlds wonder, Natures dearest Iewell, Staine not thy vertues with thy beeing cruell, O thou that art my Soules adored Saint! Be penetrable to my woes complaint. Thus the poore Bull finch spends the day in moanes, The night he wasts in deepe heart-gnawing groanes. For a most filthy vgly odious Whore, On whom he spends his substance and his store. Deuising millions of egregious lyes, To rayse his Punckes foule feature to the skyes. Epigram 32. [Looke how yon Lechers legs are worne away] Looke how yon Lechers legs are worne away, With haunting of the Whore-hose euery day: He knowes more greasie Panders, Bawds, and Drabs, And eates more Lobsters, Artichockes, and Crabs, Blew roasted Egges, Potato's Muskadine, Oysters, and pith that growes i'th Oxes Chine: With many Drugs Compounds, and Simples store, Which makes him haue a stomacke to a Whore. But one day hee'l giue ore when 'tis too late, When he stands begging through an Iron Grate. Epigram 33. [Light finger'd Francis begging in the Iayle] Light finger'd Francis begging in the Iayle, Did chance to see a friend of his passe by, Thinking his lamentations would preuaile, And that some coyne would from his bountie flye, These ancient friends, one thrall, and th'other free, One hungry, lowsie, ragged, and forlorne: The other fat with prodigality, Makes him this answer mixt with pride and scorne, What Frænke (quoth he) art there for Ale &amp; Cakes? Why how the Diuell comes this lucklesse crosse? Faith Sir (quoth Franke) your mastership mistakes. For I am heere for stealing of a Horse, Troth I mistooke indeed, and so didst thou, For at this time I haue no money now. Epigram 34. [Mounsieur Luxuri hath beene with a Puncke] Mounsieur Luxuri hath beene with a Puncke, Wherby his worships purse is shrodely shrunk. And now for penance of his former ryet, With good Duke Humfrey he must take his diet. Thus with a crosselesse purse and meatlesse maw, I judge his case quite past the helpe of Law. Epigram 35 [There chanst to meet together in an Inne] There chanst to meet together in an Inne, Foure men that thought that lying was no sinne, The first an old man was in age well enter'd, The next a trauailer that farre had venter'd, The third a Poet, in prose and verse attir'd, The fourth a Painter for his art admir'd: These foure striued each other to excell. Who should in lying beare away the Bell: The old man said that when he was a boy, To lift nine hundred waight was but a toy, To iumpe in plaine ground thirtie foote at least: Then was accounted but an idle jest. The Trauailer reply'd that he had seene, The King of Pigmies, and the Fairy Queene: And beene where triple headed Cerberus, Did guard the sulphrus gate of Erebus, The Poet he had beene at Hellicon, And rak'd from embers of obliuion Old Saturnes downefall, and Ioues royall rising, With thousand fictions of his wits deuising, And for the Painter scornes to come behinde, He paints a flying Horse, a Golden Hinde, A Sagitary, and a grim wild man, A two neckt Eagle, and a cole-blacke Swan. Now reader tell me which of those foure Lyers, Doth best deserue the whetstone for their hyers. Epigram 36. [Though Death doe Vsurers of life depriue] Though Death doe Vsurers of life depriue, Yet their extortions euer shall suruiue. Epigram 37. [Miraculous Monsters in the British clime] Miraculous Monsters in the British clime; Monsters of Nature sprung from putred slime. Sampson hat pull'd the Gates of Gaza downe, No Libian Hercules whose furious frowne, Would maze strong Gyants, tame the Lyons rage, Were not so strong as Gallants of this age: Why you shall see an vpstart Corkebraind Iacke, Will beare fiue hundred Akers on his backe, And walke as stoutly as if it were no load, And beare it to each place of his aboad, Men of such strength I iudge it necessary. That none but such should Porters burdens carry. Epigram 38. [For Gods loue tell what gallant Gullis that] For Gods loue tell what gallant Gullis that, With the great Feather, and the Beauer Hat? O now I know, his name is Mounsieur Shift, Great Cozen german to Sir Cuibert Theft, All his reuenewes still he beares about him, Whore-house nor ordinary neuer are without him. False Dice, sharp Knife, and nimble nimming fingers, Are his sworne subiects and his tribute bringers. Thus doth he swagger, sharke, steale, filch &amp; quarrell, Vntill the Hangmans Wardrop hangs his parrell. Epigram 39. [A famous House in poasting hast is built] A famous House in poasting hast is built, A gallant Porch with Pillars all beguilt, Braue loftie Chimnies pitty to defile them, Pray make no fire, for the smoake will soyle them. Epigram 40. [A worthy Knight there is of ancient fame] A worthy Knight there is of ancient fame, And sweet Sir Reuerence men doe call his name: By whose industrious policie and wit, There's many things well tane were else vnfit: If to a foule discourse thou hast pretence. Before thy foule words, name Sir Reuerence, Thy beastly tale most pleasantly will slip, And gaine thee praise, when thou deseru'st the whip. There's nothing vile that can be done or spoke, But must be couered with Sir Reuerence Cloake, His ancient pedigree who euer seekes, Shall finde he's sprung from 'mongst the gallant Greekes, Was Aiax Squire, great Champion to God Mars: Pray God Sir Reuerence blesse your Worships (?) Epigram 41. [Hvnting is all this Gentlemans delight] Hvnting is all this Gentlemans delight, Yet out of Towne his worship neuer rides; He hunts inuisible, and out of sight, For in the Citie still his Game abides. He hunts no Lyon, Tygre nor the Bore, Not Buck, nor Stag, nor Hart, nor Hinde, nor Hound, But all his sport's in hunting of a Whore, And in the chase no trauaile he will spare. He hath one Dog for hunting of the Cunny, Worth a whole k?nell of your flap-mouth'd hounds, He will not part with him for any money, But yet the Curre will course beyond his bounds, But I aduise him to respect his lot, Least too much heating make him pockie hot, Epigram 42. [Falling a sleepe, and sleeping in a dreame] Falling a sleepe, and sleeping in a dreame, Down by the dale that flows with milk &amp; cream, I saw a Rat vpon an Essex cheese, Dismounted by a Cambrian clad in Freeze. To bid his worship eate I had no need, For like a Serieant he began to feed. Epigram 43. [A french and English man at Dinner sate] A french and English man at Dinner sate, And neither vnderstanding others prate The Frenchman sayes, mange proface Monsieur, The Englishman begins to storme and sweare: By all the Diuels, and the Diuels dams, He was not mangie but ith wrists and hams. Epigram 44. [A dead dead bargaine is a quicke quicke wife] A dead dead bargaine is a quicke quicke wife, A quicke wife lyes ore long vpon ones hands, But for a dead wife that hath lost her life A man may sooner vtter then his Lands. This Riddle greatly doth amaze my head, That dead things should be quicke, and quicke things dead. Loe then Ile make an outcrie, wondrous strange, If death doe any wife of life depriue: I giue her Husband coyne to boot, and change: And for his dead wife one that is aliue: Besides, Ile pay the buriall and the Feast, And take my wife againe, when she's deceast. Epigram 45. [Momus fits mumming like an Anticke elfe] Momus fits mumming like an Anticke elfe, Hates others good, nor doth no good himselfe. Epigram 46. [Reader if any thing this Booke thee cost] Reader if any thing this Booke thee cost, Thou need'st not deeme thy coine and labor lost: 'Twill serue thee well Tobacco for to drie, Or when thou talkst with mother Anthonie, 'Twill serue for Muckenders for want of better, So farewell Reader, I remaine thy debter. Satyre. Thou that hast euer beene a rouing Thiefe, A diuing Cutpurse, or a periur'd Slaue, And in all villanie hast beene the chiefe, And with a brazen brow canst Iustice braue, That steal'st thy Pedegree from ancient houses, And iet'st in broaking Sattin euery day: That tak'st delight in stabbing and Carowses, Not caring how thou letst thy loose life stray, Thou that hast beene a Traytor to thy Prince, A great Arch-villaine to thy Natiue soyle, And wouldst by treacherie exile from thence, The blessed peace hath beene procur'd with toyle. Thou that hast beene a Machiuilian, For damned sleights, conceits, and policie: Thou that hast beene an Antichristian, Or Schismaticke with blinded Heresie, If any of these vile iniquities, Haue beene the Axioms of thy passed life; Then view the Roles of old antiquities, And see goods got with falshood, lost with strife. There shall you see how Iustice euermore, Hath poyz'd the Ballance, and vpheld the Sword, How Grauity inspir'd with Wisedomes lore, Hath Vertue honour'd, and foule vice abhorr'd. How Treason hath beene seuer'd lim from lim, How Theft and Murther there haue pay'd their hire, How those that earst in wordly Pompe did swim, Haue soyld their fortunes in disgraces mire. How Periurie hath forfeited his cares, How Cheating's mounted on the Pillorie, How gracelasse Impudents that nothing feares, Doe end their dayes in loathed miserie. How Vsurie is plagued with the Gout, How Auarice complaineth of the Stone: How guiltie Consciences are still in doubt, How Enuie gnawes on honour to the bone, How Letcherie is laden with the Poxe, How Prodigalitie doth end with woe: How Pandarisme is headed like an Oxe. Because the Destinies appoint it so. How Drunkennesse is with the Dropsie fraught, And made his visage like a fiery Comet. Who being full must haue the tother draught, Till like a Swine he wallow in his vomit. How dam'd Hypocrisie and painted zeale, And outward shew of painted Holinesse: (Doth like a Canker eate the publike weale) All scornefull pride, yet seemes all lowlinesse. To thee that read'st this, therefore be it knowne, If any of these vices are immur'd Within thy heart not to the world yet showne: If by this reading thou mayest be allur'd, To turne thy tide of life another way, And to amendment all thy thoughts incline And to thy rebell will no more obey, But seeke by vertuous actions to combine Fame to thy Friends, and terror to thy foe, And say 'twas friendly counsell told thee so. Satyre. This childish Anticke, doating pie-bald world, Thraugh which y? Diuel all black sins hath hurld Hath beene so long by wickednesse prest downe. From y? freeze-Plow-swaine to th'Imperiall crown. We haue so long in vice accustom'd beene. That nothing that is wicked lookes like sin. The glistring Courtier in his gaudie tire, Scornes with his heeles to know his russet Sire. The pettifogging Lawyer crammes vp Crownes, From hobnaild Boores, &amp; sheep skin country clowns The gaping greedie, griping, Vsurer, The Sonne of Hell, and Sathans treasurer: The base extorting black sould bribing Broaker, The Bane of Mankind and his Countries choaker. The helhoundwhelpes the shoulder-clapping Seriant, That cares not to vndoe the world for Argent. The Post Knight that will sweare away his soule, Though for the same the Law his eares doe powle. The smoakie black-lung puft Tobacconist: Whose ioy doth in Tobacco sole consist. The cholericke Gull that's tangled with a Drab, And in her quarrell will his Father stab. The baudie drie boand letcherous Baboone, Would faine repent, but thinkes it is too soone. The riming lygmonger would be a Poet, But that the Rascall hath not wit to shew it. The wrinckled baud, and dam'd vermelian whore That buyes and sels the poxe to enrich their store. The greasie eauesdropping dore-keeping Pander, That with a Punke to any man will wander. The conycatching shifter steales most briefe, And when hee's hang'd hee'l cease to be a thiefe. The drousie Drunkard will carouse and quaffe, Till like a hog he tumble in his draffe. Besides, there's diuers other Hell-borne sinnes, As some great men are wrapt in Misers skinnes, For feare of whose dislike, Ile hold me still, And not bumbast them with my Ganders quill. Consider with thy selfe Good Reader then, That here thou liust amongst those wicked men, Who on this earthly stage together keepe, Like Maggots in a Putrified sheepe, Whose damned dealings blacke confusion brings, By the iust iudgement of the King of Kings. Pastorall Equiuokes, or a Shepheards complaint. I that haue trac'd the mountaines vp and downe, And pipte and chanted Songs and pleasant layes: The whil'st my flocks haue frisk't it on the downe, Now blinded Loue my sportiue pleasure layes, I that on greenie grasse could lay me downe, And sleepe as soundly as on beds of downe. I then was free from loues all wounding blow, My Ewes and Lambs then merrily could fold; I car'd not then which way the wind did blow, Nor had I cause with griefe my armes to infold. I fear'd not Winters frost nor Summers Sunne, And then was I a happy mothers sonne. I then could haunt the Market and the Fayre, And in a frolicke humour leape and spring, Till she whose beautie did surpasse all fayre, Did with her frosty necenesse nip my Spring. Then I alas, alas vnhappy I, Was made a captiue to her scornefull eye. When loues fell shaft within my breast did light, Then did my Cock-horse pleasure all alight, Loues fierie flames Eclipsed all my light, And she vnkinde, weyd all my woes too light. Oh then my merry dayes away did hie, VVhen I so low did dote on one so hie. Her beautie, which did make Loues Queene a Crow, Whose white did shame the Lilly, red the Rose. When Phœbus messenger the Cocke did crow, Each morne when from his Antipods he rose. Despight of gates, and barres, and bolts and locks, Hee'd kisse her face, and guild her golden locks. Which makes my rest, like those that resslesse be, Like one that's hard pursu'd and cannot flye: Or like the busie buzzing humming Bee. Or like the fruitlesse nought respected Flye. That cuts the subtill ayre so swift and fast, Till in the Spiders web hee's tangled fast. As blustring Boreas rends the loftie Pine, So her vnkindnesse rends and reaues my heart; I weepe, I waile, I sigh, I groane I pine, I inward bleed, as doth the wounded Hart. She that alone should onely wish me well, Hath drown'd my ioyes in Sorrowes ioylesse well. The ruthlesse Tyger, and the Sauage Beare, All Beasts and Birds of prey that haunt the Wood, In my laments doe seeme some part to beare, But onely she, whose feature makes me wood, As barbing Autumne robs the trees of leaues, Her storme like scorne me void of comfort leaues: No Castle, Fort, no Rampier or strong Hold, But loue will enter without law or leaue; For where affections force hath taken hold, There lawlesse loue will such impression leaue, That Gods, nor men, nor fire, earth, water, winde, From loues strait lawes can neither turne nor winde. Then since my haplesse haps falls out so hard, Since all the fates on me their anger powre: Since my laments and moanes cannot be heard, And she on me shewes her commanding power. What then remaines, but I dissolue in teares. Since her disdaines my heart in pieces teares. Dye then sad heart in sorrowes prison pend, Dye face thats colour'd with a deedly dye; Dye hand that in her praise hath Poems pend, Heart, Face, and hand, haplesse and helpelesse dye. Thou Serieant Death, that rests and tak'st no bale. 'Tis onely thou must ease my bitter bale. This said, he sigh'd, and fell into a sound, That all the Hils, and Groues &amp; neighbouring Plains, The Ecchoes of his groanings seem'd to sound, With repercursion of his dying plaines. And where in life he scorned councell graue, Now in his death he rests him in his graue. Epitaph. Heere lies ingrau'd, whose life fell death did sack, Who to his graue was brought vpon a Beere: For whom let all men euer mourne in Sacke, Or else remember him in Ale or Beere. He who in life, Loues blinded God did lead, Now in his death lyes heere as cold as lead. Sonnet. Jn trust lyes Treason. The fowlest friends assume the fairest formes, The fairest Fields doth feed the foulest toad: The Sea at calm'st most subiect is to stormes, In choysest fruit the canker makes aboad. So in the shape of all belieuing trust, Lyes toad-inuenom'd-treason coached close, Till like a storme his trothlesse thoughts out burst Who canker-like had laine in trusts repose. For as the Fire within the Flint confinde, In deepest Ocean still vnquencht remaines: Euen so the false through truest seeming minde, Despight of truth the treason still retaines, Yet maugre treason, trust deserueth trust, And trust suruiues, when treason dyes accurst. Death with the foure Elements. Two infant-twinnes a Sister and a Brother, When out of dores was gone their carefull Sire, And left hir babes in keeping with their Mother, Who merrily sate singing by th? fire. Who hauing fill'd a tub with water warme, She bath'd her girle (O ruthlesse tayle to tell) The whilst she thought the other safe from harme, (Vnluckily) into the fire he fell: Which she perceiuing, lets her Daughter drowne, And rashly ran to saue her burning Sonne, Which finding dead, she hastily casts downe, And all agast, doth to the water runne: Where seeing t'other was depriu'd of breath, She 'gainst the earth falls down, &amp; dasht her braines: Her husband comes, and sees this worke of death, And desperate hangs himselfe to ease his paines. Thus Death with all the Elements conspire, To reaue mans life, Earth, Water, Ayre, and Fire. FJNJS. An Inkhorne Disputation, or Mungrell conference, betwixt a Lawyer and a Poet. With a Quarterne of new catcht Epigrams, caught the last Fishing-tide: fit for heauie stomackes in Ember-weekes, Fridayes, and Fasting-euens. A poet, and a Lawyer in dispute, And one the other striued to confute; The Poet talk't of great Apolloes shrine, Of mount Pernassus, and the Muses nine, The Lawyer's all in Cases, and in Causes, In Fines, in Fees, Recou'ries and in Clawses, The Poet answers him with Elegies, With Madrigals and Epithalamies. The Lawyer with his Writs, and his Attachments His Habeas Corpus, and his strong Apeachments: His Executions, and his Molestandums; His Scire-facies, and Testificandums, His desperate Outlaries, his Capiendoes, His Sursararies, and his Prosedendoes. The Poet at the Lawyer layes on loads, Of Dactiles, Spondees, Annagrams and Oades. Of Satyres, Epigrams, Apostrophies. Of Stops, of Commaes, of Parenthesis. Of Accents, Figures, Tautologia, Of Types, Tropes, and Amphibologia. Of Saturne, Ioue, of Mars, of Sol's hot ranging, Of Uenus, Mercurie, of Lunaes changing. Of Tragicall and Comicall predictions, Of Truth, of Suppositions and Fictions. Of Homer, Virgil, Ouid, Tasso, Terence, Du bartas, Petrarch, Plutarke, Horace, from whence Hee hath the Art, the Knowledge, and the skill To win the Lawrell from the sorked hill. The Lawyer then begins to thunder lowder, As if hee meant to blow him vp with Powder. With Actions, Cases, Capias vt legatums, With Decemtales, Scandala Magnatums: With his Sede feudendoes, and Demurs, With Prosses, Supplicauits, Præmunirs: With his Scitations, Latitats, Delayes. And diuers more tearmes, which the Law displayes. With Littleton, Fitzherbert, Ployden, Brooke, With many a lawfull, and Law-wrested Booke. The Poet boldly yet maintaines the field, And with his Inkhorne termes disdaines to yeeld. Vpon the Lawyer all a fresh hee comes, With Eglogues, and with Epicediums, With Palinodies, and Pentameters, With sharpe Iambicks, and Hexamiters. The Lawyer saw the Poet had such store, Of pickeld words, said hold; wee'le talke no more. For thou by mee, or I shall not by thee, By prating neuer edified bee. And for Conclusion, let vs both part friends, And for our profits this shall bee our ends. Wee Lawyers liue vpon the times Abuses, Whil'st Poets starue, by waiting on the Muses. Epigram 1. Vpon the word, Notwithstanding. Tom swore to Kate, he neuer more would wooe her, Kate wish't him hangd, when next he com's vnto her: But Lou's great (litle) God the man c?manding, That Tom must needs goe to her Notwithstanding. Kate rayld, and brawld and scoulded, curst, and band And 'gainst Toms not withstanding did withstand. At last the Not withstanding had forsooke, And Kate affords her Tom a welcome looke. Thus Notwithstanding did the warres increase And Stiffe withstanding made the friendly peace. Epigram 2. [Hall and his wife into the water slipt] Hall and his wife into the water slipt, She quickly Hall fast by the Codpeece gript: And reason good shee had to catch him there, For hold she fast she need no drowning feare. She oft had try'd and prou'd, and found it so, That thing would neuer to the bottome goe. Epigram 3. [Good Besse forbeare, for beare thou canst full well] Good Besse forbeare, for beare thou canst full well For thou for bearing, bear'st away the bell. Thy patience in thy bearing men admires, That bearing many wrongs yet neuer tires. Epigram 4. [Tis onely womens manners, and their carriage] Tis onely womens manners, and their carriage, That maketh them vnfit, or fit for Marriage. Then Madge thy carriage still so good hath bin Thou getst the Diu'll and all by commings in. Epigram 5. [Mall doth commend Sims comlinesse of stature] Mall doth commend Sims comlinesse of stature, But most she likes his freenesse of his Nature. For she will sweare indeed la, and in truth: That Sim was euer a sweet natur'd youth. Epigram 6. [A messenger, (declaring of his mind)] A messenger, (declaring of his mind) In making curtesie, let a scape behind, Hee looking backe, peace (Sirrha) peace (quoth he) For if you talke, I sure will silent be. Epigram 7. [The Merchant (Drubo) hyer'd a seruant lasse] The Merchant (Drubo) hyer'd a seruant lasse, And for her wages he doth duly pay. From Christmas quarter vnto Michaelmas, She hath it payd her to a haire (they say) Sometimes betwixt the quarters she doth take it, For let it come when 'twill shee'le not forsake it. And for her Master honest Drubo (hee) He often payes her with a standing fee. Epigram 8. [Fie what an idle life man liues (quoth Dicke)] Fie what an idle life man liues (quoth Dicke) How idely they their liues away doe passe: Whil'st painefull women wins both praise and p. Induring as they were compos'd of Brasse. I thinke mens idlenesse was neuer such, And women ne're were occupi'd so much. Epigram 9. [It is no wonder wherefore little Nell] It is no wonder wherefore little Nell, So bigge below the waste begins to swell: For being hungry (in the darke she stole, A hastie Pudding and deuour'd it whole. Epigram 10. [As through the Citie I did lately passe] As through the Citie I did lately passe, At a Carts tayle, a Beadle whipt a lasse. I stept vnto him, and I ask'd the cause, Quoth he I whipt her, for she brake the Lawes: In letting out her formost Roome for pelfe, And (for her pleasure) backward lay her selfe. Epigram 11. [A little woman did a bigge man wed] A little woman did a bigge man wed, And he was loath to lye with her in bed, For feare to hurt her: then she spyed a Mouse, That play'd, and leapt, and skipt about the house. O Husband would I had that Mouse quoth she, Her skin would make a paire of gloues for me. So wide (quoth he) I know twill neuer stretch, Content your selfe (qd. she) young things will reach. Epigram 12. [A lustie wench as nimble as an Eele] A lustie wench as nimble as an Eele, Would giue a Gallant leaue to kisse and feele, His itching humour straight-way was in hope, To toy, to wanton, dally, busse and grope, Hold Sir (quoth she) my word I will not faile, For you shall feele my hand, and kisse my T. Epigram 13. On Mistresse Charitie In very deedla, and sinceritie, There is much Charitie in Charitie. She hath so kinde, so free a liberall heart, That euery man of her shall haue a part. Epigram 14. [Two Sheepe (in Law) did lately long contend] Two Sheepe (in Law) did lately long contend, And Wolfe the Lawyer must the matter end. Who with his fine fines, and his firking fees, Drawes both their purses to the very lees, The mony gone, the strife of Law did cease, They fooles fell out, and beggers made the peace. Epigram 15. [Mad dapper Dicke, doth very often shift] Mad dapper Dicke, doth very often shift, And yet hee's lowzie through the want of shift. Epigram 16. On Madam Temperance. A man that went to trauaile swore to's wife, He would loue Temp'rance as he lou'd his life, Indeed he lou'd a faire and beauteous Dame, (Although intemperate) Temp'rance was her name. On whom he spent his loue, his lust, his store. He might as well haue spent it on a whore. Epigram 17. [Doll held the Candle, Raph would faine be doing] Doll held the Candle, Raph would faine be doing, O when (qd. she) will you fr? lewdnes turne ye, I prethee Doll quoth Raph regard my woing, In truth quoth Doll lea be, or else ile burne ye. Raph puts the light out, sweares to haue about, And yet Doll burn'd him though the fire was out. Epigram 18. [As at an Inne I lately did a-light] As at an Inne I lately did a-light, I to my Chamber lighted was with lights: Where a light Curtezan (of manners light) Make glad my heart, my Liuer, and my Lights. Yet when the Candle light was me bereft, For all those lights I was in darkenesse left. Epigram 19. Light vanitie. What is more light then vapor, cork, or feather Or what more light then Vanity can be? Compact, compose, compare light things together, And nothing's lighter then a wanton she. Yet heere's the Riddle, (past my wits to scan) Her lightnesse weighes downe many a heauy man. Epigram 20. [Twas ne're so hard (since first the world began)] Twas ne're so hard (since first the world began) To finde an honest true right, handed man. Hath man two left hands? no; I pray how then, Are men nor right hand, or left handed men? The left hand now, may well be call'd the left, For true and honest dealing it hath left. And for the right hand, 'tis the wrong hand sure, It selfe to wrong, or wrong doth still inure. So to conclude (I doubt) aboue the ground A true right handed man, can scarce be found. Epigram 21. [My Lawyer said the case was plaine for mee] My Lawyer said the case was plaine for mee, The Angell told him so hee tooke for fee: But yet my Angell and my Lawyer lyed, For at my Iudgement I was damnifi'd. Epigram 22. [As Gold is better that's in fire tride] As Gold is better that's in fire tride, So is the Bankside Globe that late was burn'd: For where before it had a thatched hide, Now to a stately Theator 'tis turn'd. Which is an Emblem, that great things are won, By those that dare through greatest dangers run. Epigram 23. [Good companie's in such request with Jone] Good companie's in such request with Jone, Tis death to her to walke or lye alone. Epigram 24. [I scorne (quoth Alice) to be put downe by any] I scorne (quoth Alice) to be put downe by any, And yet 'tis knowne she's bin put downe by many. Epigram 25. [My Ladies foysting-hound (surnamed Muske)] My Ladies foysting-hound (surnamed Muske) Did chance to mute vpon my Ladies buske: But ouer all the world, 'twixt Heauen and Hell, I thinke no Muske had euer stronger smell. Epilogve. Good Reader, if my harsh vnlearned rimes, (Wherewith my Muse hath whipt these heedlesse times) Hath pleas'd thy pallat with their true endeauour: She then will thinke her selfe most fortunate, And shall hereafter bee importunate, Her selfe in better labours to perseuer. I speake not to those ignorant Iacke-dawes, That with their Canker-biting enuious jawes, Will seeme to staine my Muses innocence. But in all humblenesse I yeeld to those, Who are detracting Ignorances foes: And loues the labours of each good pretence. Dislike and scorne may chance my Booke to smother, But kind acceptance brings forth such another. You that the Sculler right doth vnderstand, Hee's very glad you'r safely come to Land. But if that any snarling man like Monster, His honest meaning wroungfully misconster: To such in all despight, hee sends this word, From Booke and Boat hee'le hurle them ouer-bord. I. T. FINIS. A BRAVE SEA-FIGHT in the Gulph of Persia. A farewell and hearty well-wishing to the noble attempts of our English Sea and Land forces, with their Allies and Confederates. You sons of Mars that furrow Neptunes brow, And o're the dang'rous Deep (vndanted) plow; You who esteeme your Countries honor more, Than life or pelfe, (which Peasants doe adore) Your noble Ancestours, whose memories Are borne by Fame as farre as Titans Rise, And vniversally diuulg'd from thence The Circle of the worlds circumference, Let their example be a spurre to you, That you their worthy vertues may pursue: They were but men, and you are each so much, They were victorious, may you each be such; They had good courage guided with good skill, Which skill and Courage, Fortune, Grace and Will, I doe implore th'Almighty to bestow, On you in generall, All, both high and low. Time doth record our Britaines matchlesse force By Sea and Land, with valiant foot or horse, Hath made France tremble and proud Spaine to quake, And great Ierusalems foundations shake: And as true valour did inspire their brests, So Victory and Conquest crown'd their Crests. O may your good intendments fall out right, The God of Battels still your Battels fight; That as your Fathers were, so you may be, Rare Patternes vnto your posteritie: That all our Foes with terrour now may know They haue beene beaten, and they must be so, True Honour, Fame, and Victory attend you: And high Iehouah in your cause defend you: That Immortality your fames may Crowne, And GOD may haue the Glorie and Renowne. Iohn Taylor. TAYLORS PASTORALL, BEING BOTH HISTORICALL And Satyricall. OR, The noble Antiquitie of Shepheards, with the profitable vse of Sheepe: With a small touch of a scabbed Sheepe, and a Caueat against that Infection. DEDICATED TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFULL, JUDICIOUS, and truly Generous, my well approued good friend, Mr. Thomas Dove, Archdeacon of Northampton, the accomplishment of his worthy desires Temporall and Eternall. [All those that will not reade this plaine Epistle] All those that will not reade this plaine Epistle, Lay downe the Booke, on Gods name, and goe whistle. TAYLORS PASTORALL, BEING BOTH HISTORICALL And Satyricall. OR, The noble Antiquitie of Shepheards, with the profitable vse of Sheepe. [Apollo (Father of the Sisters nine] Apollo (Father of the Sisters nine, I craue thy ayde t'inspire this Muse of mine, Thou that thy golden Glory didst lay by (As Ouid doth relate most wittily) And in a Shepheards shape, didst deigne to keepe Thy Loues beloued Sire, Admerus sheepe. And rurall Pan, thy helpe I doe intreat, That (to the life) the praise I may repeat Of the contented life, and mightie stockes Or happie Shepheards, and their harmlesse flockes, But better thoughts my Errors doe controule For an offence, most negligent and foule, In thus inuoking, like a Heathen man, Helpe, helplesse, from Apollo, or from Pan: When as the subiect, which I haue in hand, Is almost infinite, as Starres, or sand, Grac'd with Antiquitie, vpon Record In the Eternall, neuer-failing Word. There 'tis ingrauen true and manifest, That Sheep and Shepheards, were both best and blest. I therefore inuocate the gracious aide Of Thee, whose mightie Word hath all things made, I Israels great Shepheard humbly craue That his assur'd assistance I may haue: That my vnlearned Muse no verse compile. Which may bee impious, prophane or vile, And though through Ignorance, or negligence, My poore inuention fall into offence, I doe implore that boundlesse Grace of his, Not strictly to regard what is amisse: But vnto me belongeth all the blame, And all the Glory bee vnto his Name. Yet as this Booke is verse, so men must know, I must some fictions and Allusions show, Some shreds, sow remnants, reliques, or some scraps. The Muses may inspire me with perhaps. Which taken literally, as lies may seeme, And so mis-vnderstanding may misdeeme. Of Sheepe therefore, before to worke I fall, Ile shew the Shepheards first originall: Those that the best Records will reade and marke, Shall finde iust Abel was a Patriarke, Our father Adams second sonne, a Prince, (As great as any man, begotten since) Yet in his function hee a Shepheard was: And so his mortall Pilgrimage did passe. And in the sacred Text it is compil'd, That hee that's father of the Faithfull stil'd, Did as a Shepheard, liue vpon th'increase Of Sheepe, vntill his dayes on earth did cease: And in those times it was apparent then Abel Abel a Prince, a Patriarke, a figure of the true Church, a type of Christ, and a Shepheard. Abraham a Prince, a Patriarke, intituled with the Glorious tytle of Father of the Faithfull, a Shepheard. and Abram both were Noble men: The one obtain'd the tytle righteously For his vnfeigned seruing the most High, Hee first did offer Sheepe, which (on Record) Was Sacrifice accepted of the Lord. Hee was (before the Infant world was ripe) The Churches figure, and his Sauiours type. A murdered Martyr, who for seruing God, Did first of all feele persecutions rod. And Abraham was in account so great, Abimelech his friendship did intreat. Faiths patterne, and Obedience sample, hee Like Starres, or sand, was in posteritie: In him the Nations of the Earth were blest, Jflask. And now his bosome figures heau'nly Rest. His Sheepe almost past numbring multiply'd, And when (as he thought) Isaac should haue dy'd, Then by th' Almighties Mercies, Loue, and Grace A Sheepe from out a Bush supply'd the place. Lot was a Shepheard, (Abrams brothers sonne) And such great fauour from his God he wonne, That Sodom could not be consum'd with fire, Till hee and his did out of it retire, They felt no vengeance for their foule offence, Till righteous Lot was quite departed thence. And Iacob, as the holy Ghost doth tell, Who afterwards was called Israel, Who wrastled with his God, and (to his fame) Obtain'd a Name, and Blessing for the same, Hee (vnder Laban) was a Shepheard long, And suffred from him much ingratefull wrong, For Rachel and for Leah, hee did beare The yoke of seruitude full twentie yeare, Hee was a Patriarke, a Prince of might, Whose wealth in Sheepe, was almost infinite, His twice sixe sonnes (as holy writ describes, Who were the famous Fathers, of twelue Tribes) Were for the most part Shepheards, and such men Whose like the world shall ne're containe agen. Young Ioseph, 'mongst the rest, especially, A constant mirrour of true Chastitie: Who was in his affliction, of behauiour A mortall Tipe of his immortall Sauiour: And Truth his Mother Rachel doth expresse To be her father Labans Shepheardesse. Meeke Moses, whom the Lord of hosts did call To leade his people out of Ægypts thrall, Whose power was such, as no mans was before, Nor since his time hath any mans beene more, Yet in the Sacred text it plaine appeares, That he was Iethroes Shepheard fortie yeares. Heroycke David, Jshaies youngest sonne, Whose acts immortall memorie hath wonne: Whose valiant vigour did in pieces teare A furious Lyon and a rauenous Beare: Who (arm'd with Faith and fortitude alone) Slew great Goliah, with a sling and stone, Whose victories the people sung most plaine, Saul hath a thousand, Hee ten thousand slaine. Hee from the Sheepfold came to be a King, Whose fame for euer through the world shall ring: Hee was another Tipe of that blest Hee That Was, and is, and euermore shall bee. His vertuous Acts are writ for imitation, His holy Hymnes and Psalmes for consolation, For Reprehension and for Contemplation, And finally to shew vs our saluation. The Prophet Amos, vnto whom the Lord Reueal'd the sacred secrets of his Word: God rais'd him from the Sheepfold to foretell What Plagues should fall on sinfull Israell. True Seth and Noah, were Shepheards and feeders of Cattle. Patience patterne, Prince of his affections, Iob. Most mightie tamer of his imperfections, Whose guard was God, whose guide the holy Ghost, Blest in his wealth, of which Sheepe was the most. Iust Jobs lost riches doubled was agen, Who liu'd belou'd of God, admir'd of men. The first of happie tydings on the earth, Of our all onely Sauiours blessed birth, The glorious Angels to the Shepheards told, As Luke th'Euangelist doth well vnfold. Luk .2 .8. And should my verse a little but decline To humane stories, and leaue diuine: There are some mightie Princes I can name, Whose breeding (at the first) from Shepheards came. Romes founder (Romulus) was bred and fed, Mongst Shepheards, where his youthfull dayes he led. The Persian Monarch (Cyrus) hee did passe His youth with Valerius, Maximus, and Aurelianus, were raised from beeing Heardsmen to the Imperiall dignitie. Shepheards, and a Shepheard was, The Terrour of the World, that famous man Who conquer'd Kings, and kingdomes ouer ran His stile was, (as some stories doe repeat) The Scythian Shepheard, Tamberlaine the Great. Tis such a Tytle of preheminence, Of reuerence, and such high magnificence, That Dauid, (who so well his words did frame) Did call our great Creator by that name. Psal. 80. 1 Our blest Redeemer (Gods eternall Sonne) Whose onely merits our Saluation wonne. He did the harmlesse name of Shepheard take For our protection, and his Merciss sake. Iob 10, 11 Those that will reade the sacred Text, and looke With diligence, throughout that heauenly Booke, Shall finde the Ministers haue Epithites, And named Angels, Stewards, Watchmen, Lights, Salt, Builders, Husbandmen, and Starres that shine, (Inflamed with the Light which is Diuine) And with these names, within that Booke compil'd, They with the Stile of Shepheards are instil'd. Thus God the Sire, and Sonne, the Scriptures call Both Shepheards, mysticall and literall, And by similitudes comparing to, All Kings and Churchmen beare that tytle do. [Wise and Inscrutable, Omniscient] A. E. I. O. V. two Anagrams of the fiue Vowels, the one serues for the glorious name of GOD, and the other in the Spanish tongue is a Sheepe, which name the Prophet Esay doth figuratiuely or mystically call our Creator Ieova, or Iehovah, Oveia, is a Sheepe. Wherein may bee perceiued, that there is no Word, Name or Action, in or vnder Heauen, but hath one or more of the fiue Vowels, and that no word or Name hath them all without other Letters, but Ieova, and Oveia. Which doth admonish vs in the feare and reuerence of the Almightie, because in all our thoughts, words and actions, some part of his wonderfull Name is infinitely included. And withall that Oveia or a Sheepe is a most significant Emblem, or signe of our God and Sauiours innocencie and patient sufferings. Wise and Inscrutable, Omniscient, Eternall, Gracious, and Omnipotent, In Loue, in Iustice, Mercy &amp; in Might In Honour, Power and Glory infinite In workes, in words, in euery Attribute Almightie All commanding, Absolute; For who so notes the Letters of the name Iehovah, shall perceiue within the same, The Vowels of all Tongues included be: So hath no name that e're was nam'd but He. And I haue heard some Schollers make Relation, That H'is but a breathing Aspiration; A letter that may be left out and spar'd, Whereby is cleerely to our sight declar'd, That Great Iehova may be written true With onely Vowels, A, E, I, O, V: And that there is no word or name but this, That hath them all alone, but onely His. So that the Heauens with all the mighty Host Of Creatures there, Earth, Sea, or any Coast, Or Climate, any Fish, or Fowle, or Beast, Or any of His workes, the most and least, Or thoughts, or words, or writing with the Pen, Or deedes that are accomplished by men, But haue some of these Letters in them all, And God alone hath all in Generall. By which we see, according to his will, He is in all things, and doth all things fill, And all things said or done, he hath ordain'd, Some part of his great Name's therein contain'd, All future, present, and all past things seeing, In whom we liue, and moue, and haue our being. Almightie, All in All, and euery where, Eternall, in whom change cannot appeare, Immortall, who made all things mortall else, Omnipotent, whose Power all Power excels; Vnited, Three in one, and one in Three, Ieova: Vnto whom all Glory bee. Besides the learned Poets of all times, Haue chanted out the praise, in pleasant rimes, The harmelesse liues of rurall shepheards Swaines, And beautious shepheardesses on the plaines, In All the famous Poets and Poetesses of all tongues and nations, haue written vpon this worthy subiect. Odes, in Roundelaies, and Madrigals, In Sonnets, and in well pen'd Pastorals: They haue recorded, most delightfully, Their loues, their fortunes, and felicitie, And sure, if in this low terrestriall Round Plaine honest happinesse is to be found; It with the Shepheards is remaining still, Because they haue least power to doe ill: And whilst they on their feeding flockes attend, They haue the least occasions to offend. Ambition, Pompe, and Hell begotten Pride, And damned Adulation, they deride: The complementall flatt'rie of Kings Courts, Is neuer intermix'd amidst their sports; They seldome enuie at each others state, Their loue and feare is Gods, the deuil's their hate. In weightie businesse they nor marre or make, And cursed bribes they neither giue or take. They are not guiltie (as some great men are) T'vndoe their Mercer and Embroiderer, Their Taylor, Butcher, Brewer, Baker, Powlter, (For which there's some haue well deseru'd a halter) Their Shoomaker and Silkman I forgot, Though breaking, or else begg'rie be their lot, Nor is't a Shepheards trade, by night or day To sweare themselues in debt, and neuer pay. Hee's no state-plotting Machinilian, Or Proiect-monger Monopolitan: Hee hath no trickes or wiles to circumuent, Nor feares he when there comes a Parliament. He neuer weares his cap, nor bends his knee To feed Contention with a Lawyers fee: He wants the art to Cog, Cheat, Sweare and Lie, Nor feares the Gallowes, or the Pillorie. Nor cares he if great men be fooles or wise, If honour fall, and base dishonour rise, Let fortunes mounted minions sinke or swim, Hee neuer breakes his braines, all's one to him. He's free from fearefull curses of the poore, And liues and dies content, with lesse, or more. Great temporance in Shepheards. He doth not waste the time as many vse, His good Creators creatures to abuse, In drinking sicke vngodly healths to some, The veryest Cankerwormes of Christendome: My Lord Ambition and my Lady Pride, Shall with his quaffing not be magnifide: Nor for their sakes will he carowse and feast, Vntill (from man) he be turn'd worse then beast, Whereby he scapes vaine oathes, and blasphemy, And surfets, (fruits of drunken gluttony.) He scapes occasion vnto lusts pretence, And so escapes the Poxe by consequence. Thus doth he scape the Parator and Proctor, Th'Apothecary, Surgeon, and Doctor, Whereby he this prerogatiue may haue, To hold the laying in into his graue, Whilst many, that his betters farre haue bin, Will very hardly hold the laying in. These are great priuiledges though few men seeke or care for them. Thus Shepheards liue; and thus they end their liues, Adorn'd and grac'd with these prerogatiues: And when he dyes he leaues no wrangling heyres To law till all be spent, and nothing theirs, Hooke, Tar-box, Bottle, Bag, Pipe, Dog, and all, Shall breed no iarres in Westminsters great Hall: Peace and tranquility was all his life, And (dead) his goods shall breed no cause of strife. Thus Shepheards haue no places, meanes, or times, To fall into these hell-deseruing crimes, Which Courtiers, Lawyers, Tradesmen, men of arms. Commit, vnto their Soules and Bodies harmes. And from the Shepheards now ile turne my stile To sundry sorts of Sheepe another while. The Lambs that in the Iewes passeouer dy'd, Were figures of the Lambe that's crucifi'd Esa. 53. 7. 1. Iob. 1. 29 And Esay doth compare our heauenly food T'a Sheepe, which dumb before the shearer stood: Whose death, and merits, did this title win, The Lambe of God, which freed the world from sin Lambe Anagram's Blame. Balme.The Anagram's of Lambe is Blame and Balme. And Christ, the Lambe, vpon him tooke our Blame, His precious Blood (Gods heauy wrath did calme) 'Twas th'onely Balme for Sinne to cure the same: All power, and praise, and glory be therefore, Ascribed to the Lambe for euermore. And in the threescore nineteenth Psalme we read, That like a Sheepe our God doth Joseph lead. Againe, of vs he such account doth keepe, That of his Pasture we are called Sheepe. And euery day we doe confesse (almost) That we haue err'd and stray'd like Sheepe that's lost. Our Sauiour, (that hath bought our Soules so deare) Hath said, his Sheepe his voice will onely heare: And Thrice did Christ vnto Saint Peter call, (In which he spake to his Disciples all) Ioh. 21. 15, 16. If you doe loue me, feed my Sheepe (quoth he) And feed my Lambs well, if you doe loue me. Moreouer, in the final Iudgement day, There is the right hand, and the left hand way, Whereas the sheepe he to himselfe doth gather, With saying, Come, ye blessed of my Father, &amp;c. And to the Goats, in his consuming ire, He bids, Depart into eternall fire. Thus our Redeemer, and his whole elect, The name of Sheepe held euer in respect, And the comparison holds reference To profit, and to harmelesse innocence. For of all beasts that euer were, or are, None can (for goodnesse) with a Sheepe compare: Indeed, for bone and burthen I must grant. He's much inferiour to the Elephant, The Dromedarie, Camell, Horse, and Asse, For loade and carriage doth a Sheepe surpasse: Strong Taurus, Eunuch sonne, the labouring Oxe, The stately Stagge, the bobtaild craftie Foxe, These, and all rauenous beasts of prey, must yeeld Vnto the Sheepe, the honour of the field. An Oxe is the Eunuch sonne of a Bull. I could recount the names of many more, The Lyon, Vnicorne, the Beare and Bore: The Wolfe, the Tyger, the Rhinoscerot, The Leopard, and a number more I wot. But all these greedie Beasts, great Ouids pen Doth say are metamorphos'd into men, For Beast to Beast afford more conscience can, And much losse cruelty, than man to man. Ile therefore let such Beasts be as they be, For feare they kicke, and snap and snarle at me. Vnto the Sheepe againe my Muse doth flye, For honest safetie, and commoditie, He with his flesh and fleece, doth feed and clad, All Languages and Nations, good and bad: What can it more, but dye, that we may liue, And euery yeare to vs a liuery giue? 'Tis such a bountie, and the charge so deepe, That nothing can afford the like, but Sheepe. For should the world want Sheepe but 5 whole yere. Ten thousand millions would want cloathes to weare: And wer't not for the flesh of this kind beast, The world might fast, when it doth often feast. There's nothing doth vnto a Sheepe pertaine, But 'tis for mans commoditie and gaine: For men to men so much vntrusty are, To lye, to couzen, to forsweare and sweare: That oathes, and passing words, and ioyning hands, Is like assurance written in the sands, To make men keepe their words, and mend all this. The silly Sheepe-skin turn'd to parchment is. There's many a wealthy man, whose whole tstate, Lyes more in Parchment, then in coyne or Plate. Indentures, Leases, Euidences, Wills, Bonds, Contracts, Records, Obligations, Bils, With these (although the sheepeskin is but weake) It binds men strongly that they dare not breake. But if a man eates Spiders now and then, The oyle of Parchment cures him oft agen. And what rare stuffes which in the world are fram'd, Can be in value like to Parchment nam'd; The richest cloth of gold that can be found, A yard of it was nere worth fiftie pound: And I haue seene two foot of Sheepeskin drest, Which hath bin worth ten thousand pounds at least. A peece of parchment well with Inke lac'd ouer, Helps many a gallant to a Sattin couer: Into the Mercer it some Faith doth strike, It giues the Silkeman Hope of no dislike: The Taylor it with Charitie assailes, It thrusts him last betwixt his Bill and Uailes, And by these meanes, a piece of parchment can Patch vp, and make a Gull a Gentleman, The Nature of it very strange I finde, 'Tis much like Physicke, it can loose and binde: 'Tis one mans freedome, and anothers noose, And like the Pope it doth both binde and loose. If the Taylors Bill be out of measure to the Gentleman, then he can make a fit measure for him with his owne bond. And as the Ram and Ewe doe fructifie, And euery yeare a Lambe doth multiply: So doth a sheepe-skin Bond make money breed, And procreate, as feed doth spring from seed. An hundred pounds the Ewe, which euery yeare Doth breed a ten pound Lambe, (all charges cleare.) A Bond is the Ewe, the borrower and lender are both Rams, and the interest is the Lambe. Thus is a sheepe-skin prou'd the onely Tie, And stay, whereon a world of men relye, Which holds a crew of Earth wormes in more awe, Then both the Tables of the sacred Law. Past number, I could many functions name Who (as 'tis parchment) liue vpon the same: But 'tis sufficient this small homely touch, Should all be writ, my Booke would swell too much. Now for the Ram, the Ewe, the Lambs, and Weather, Ile touch their skins as they are turn'd to Leather, And made in Purses, Pouches, Laces, strings, Gloues, Points, Book Couers, &amp; ten thousand things. And many Tradesmen liue and thriue thereby, Which if I would, I more could amplifie. Their Guts serue Instruments which sweetly sound, Their Dung is best to make most fruitfull ground; Their Hoofes burnt will most venom'd Serpents kill, Their grated Hornes are good 'gainst poyson still: Their Milke makes Cheese, mans hunger to preuent, As I haue seene in Sussex and in Kent. Their Trotters, for the healthy or the sicke, (Drest as they should be) are good meat to picke. The Cookes and Butchers with the Ioints doe gaine And poore folkes eate the Gather, Head, and braine; And though all wise mens iudgement will allow A Sheepe to be much lesser then a Cow, Yet in a Leg of Mutton I can see, More meat then in a Leg of Beefe can be. A line Sheepe hath one Necke, yet I perceiue, Sheepe being dead, two neckes of Mutton haue. Foure legs each liuing Sheepe hath, but once slaine, (Although he loose none, yet) he hath but twaine. Now for the honour of the valiant Ram, If I were learn'd more treble then I am, Yet could I not sufficiently expresse His wondrous worth, and exc'llent worthinesse. For by Astronomers 'tis verifide Aries. How that the Ram in heauen is stellifide, And (of the twelue is plac'd head signe of all, Where Sol keepes first his Equinoctiall. For, hauing at the Bull drunke Aprils showres, And with y? Twins, May deck'd y? earth with flowers And scorch'd the Crab in Iune with burning beames, Made Julies Lyon chase with fierie gleames; In August solace to the Virgin giuen With Ballance in September made Time euen, Octobers Scorpion with declining course, And passing by Decembers Archers force, Then hauing past Nouembers frozen Goate, He next to Ianus Waterie Signe doth floate: He to the Lenten Signe in February, And so bright Phœbus ends his yeres vagarie. Then, to the Ram, in March, in his careere, He mounts, on which this Sonnet's written heere. Sonnet. [Now cheerefull Sol in his illustrious Carre] Now cheerefull Sol in his illustrious Carre, To glad the Earth, his Iourney gins to take; And now his glorious beames he doth vnbarre, What absence marr'd, his presence now doth make: Now he Earths weeping visage gins to dry With Eols breath, and his bright heauenly heat. March dust (like clouds) through ayre doth march &amp; fly: Dead-seeming Trees and Plants now life doth get. Thus when the Worlds eye dazler takes his Inne, At the cœlestiall Ram, then Winter's done: And then Dame Nature doth her liuerie spinne Of flowers and fruits, which all the Earth puts on. Thus when Apollo doth to Aries come, The Earth is freed from Winters Martyrdome. Thus haue I prou'd the Ram a luckie signe, Wherein Heau'n, Earth, and Sun and Ayre combine, To haue their vniuersall comforts hurld Vpon the Face of the decaying world. With twelae signes each mans body's gouerned, And Aries or the Ram, doth rule the head, Then are their iudgements foolish, fond, and base, That take the name of Ramhead in disgrace; 'Tis honour for the head to haue the name, Deriued from the Ram that rules the same: And that the Ram doth rule the head, I know, For euery Almanacke the same doth show. To be cald Ramhead is a title of honour, and a name proper to all men. He that sels wood, is call'd a Woodmonger; He that sels fish is call'd a Fishmonger; He that doth brew, is call'd a Brewer; and He's call'd a Landlord, that takes rent for Land; He that bakes Bread, scornes not the name of Baker; He that makes Cuckolds, is a Cuckold-maker. So as the Ram doth rule the head, I see, By Constellation all men Ramheads be. And as the twelue Celestiall signes beare sway, And with their motions passe mans life away; The Ram, the head, the Bull, the necke and throte, Twins, shoulders, Crab, doth rule the brest, I note, But 'tis the Lyons portion and his part, To be the valiant ruler of the heart. A comfort for Cuckolds, that though a man hath a Rams head, yet he hath a Lyons heart. From whence such men may gather this reliefe, That though a Ramhead may be cause of griefe, Yet Nature hath this remedie found out, They should haue Lyons hearts to beare it stout, And to defend and keepe the head from harme, The Anagram of Ram, I finde is; Arm. Thus is a Ramhead arm'd against all feare, He needs no helmet, or no head-piece weare. To speake more, in the plurall number, Rams, It yeilds signifique warre like Anagrams, For Rams is Mars, Mars is the God of Warre, And Rams is Arms, Arms warres munitions are; And from the fierce encounters which they make, Our Tilts and Tournyes did beginnings take, For as the Rams retire and meet with rage, So men doe in their warre-like equipage. Strange mysteries in the words Ram or Rams: the Rams the first runners at Tilt, and first teachers of warlike battell. Josephus Bellar, lib. 3. cap. 9. Rams hornes the first Trumpets. And long e're powder, (from Hels damned den, Was monstrously produc'd to murther men, The Ram, an Engine call'd a Ram, did teach, To batter downe a wall, or make a breach. And now some places of defence 'gainst shot, Haue (from the Ram) the name of Rampiers got. First warlike trumpets that I e're heard nam'd, At Jericho, were all of Rams hornes fram'd: For at the Rams horne Trumpets fearefull blast, Their curled Walls were suddenly downe cast. Thus is the Ram with many vertues stor'd, And was in Ægygt for a God ador'd: And like a Captaine he the flocke doth lead, As fits their Generall their Prince or head: Thus haue I prou'd a Sheepe, a beast of price, Cleane, and reputed fit for Sacrifice: And sleeping, waking, earely, or else late, It still doth chew the cud and ruminate. Of all Beasts in the worlds circumference, For meekenesse, profit, and for innocence, I haue approu'd a Sheepe most excellent, That wich least cost doth giue man most content. There's such instinct of Nature in the Lambe, By bleating, Jt mongst thousands knowes the dam; For which the name of Agnoscendo knowing, Is giuen to a Lambe, its knowledge showing. Agnus, Great knowledge in the Lambe. [This was a Lambe, whose like was neuer any] This was a Lambe, whose like was neuer any, Whose loue and pitty fed and cloth'd so many: And 'tis no doubt, but these good deeds of his, Did helpe to lift his Soule to endlesse Blisse. [And now from solid Prose I will abstaine] Here followeth a touch of paultry Scabbed and infectious kinds of Sheepe, which J thinke fit to place by themselues in the lagge end of my Booke, as farre as J can from the cleaue, sound and profitable Sheepe before mentioned, for feare the bad should infect the good. And now from solid Prose I will abstaine To pleasant Poetrie, and mirth againe. The Fable of the golden Fleece began, 'Cause Sheepe did yeeld such store of gold to Man: For he that hath great store of woolly Fleeces, May (when he please) haue store of golden peeces. Thus many a poore man dying hath left a Sonne, That hath tranform'd the Fleece to Gold like Iason: And heere's a mystery profound and deepe, There's sundry sorts of Mutton, are no Sheepe: Lac'd Mutton which let out themselues to hire, Like Hackneys, who'l be fir'd, before they tire. The man or men which for such Mutton hungers, Are (by their Corporation) Mutton mongers: Which is a brother-hood so large and great, That if they had a Hall, I would intreat To be their Clarke, or keeper of accounts, To shew them vnto what their charge amounts: My braines in numbring then would grow so quicke I should be Master of Arithmeticke: All States, degrees, and Trades, both bad and good, Afford some members of this Brotherhood; Great therefore needs must be their multitude, When euery man may to the Trade intrude; It is no fredome, yet these men are free, Not sauers, but most liberall spenders be: For this is one thing that doth them bewitch, That by their trading they waxe seldome rich: The value of this Mutton to set forth, The flesh doth cost more than the broth is worth: They all are Ewes, yet are exceeding Ramish, And will be dainty fed, whoso'uer famish. Nor are they mark'd for any man, or no man. As mine, or thine, but euery mans in common, Fine heads, and neckes, and breasts, they yeeld some store, But scarcely one good liuer in nine score: The liuers being bad, 'tis vnderstood, The veines are fild with putrified blood, Which makes them subiect to the scab, and then They proue most dangerous diet vnto men. And then the prouerbe proues no lye or mocke, One scabbed sheep's enough to spoyle a flocke. But yet for all this, there is many a Gull, Loues Mutton well, and dips his bread i' the wooll. And were a man put to his choyce to keepe, 'Tis said, a Shrew is better then a Sheepe. But if a man be yok'd with such an Eros, She may be both a scabbed Sheepe and Shrew. And he that is so match'd, his life may well Compared be vnto an earthly hell. But to my Theame which I wrote of before, I at this Mutton must haue one cut more. These kind of Sheepe haue all the world ore'growne, And seldome doe weare fleeces of their owne: For they from sundry men their pelts can pull, Whereby they keepe themselues as warme as wooll. Besides, in colours, and in shape, they varie Quite from all profitable sheepe contrarie? White, blacke, greene, tawny, purple, red, and blue, Beyond the Raine-bow for their change of hue: Came ion like in alteration, But, that bare Ayre they cannot liue vpon. The Moones mutation's, not more manifold, Silke, Veluet, Tissue, Cloath, and cloath of Gold: These are the Sheepe that Golden fleeces weare, Who robe themselues with others wooll or haire: And it may bee, 'twas such a Beast and Fleece, Which Jason brought from Cholcos, into Greece. They are as soft as Silke-wormes. VVere it no more but so, I dare be bold To thinke this Land doth many Jasons hold: VVho neuer durst to passe a dang'rous waue, Yet may (with ease) such Golden fleeces haue. Too much of one thing's good for nought (they say) Ile therefore take this needlesse dish away: For should I too much of Lac'd Mutton write, I may o'recome my readers stomacke quite. Once more vnto the good Sheepe ile retire, And so my Booke shall to its end exspire: Although it be not found in ancient writers, I finde all Mutton-eaters are Sheepe-biters. And in some places I haue heard and seene, That currish Sheepe biters haue hanged beene. If any kinde of Tike should snarle or whine, Or bite, or woorry this poore Sheepe of mine, Why let them barke and bite, and spend their breath. Ile neuer wish them a Sheepe biters death. My Sheepe will haue them know, her Innocence Shall liue in spight of their malcuolence: I wish them keepe themselues and me from paine, And bite such sheepe as cannot bite againe. For if they snap at mine, I haue a pen, That (like a trusty dog) shall bite agen. And in conclusion, this I humbly craue, That euery one the honesty may haue, That when our fraile mortality is past, We may be the good Shepheards sheepe at last. FINIS. THE PRAISE OF HEMP-SEED. WITH The Uoyage of Mr. Roger Bird and the Writer hereof, in a Boat of browne-Paper, from London to Quanborough in Kent. As also, a Farewell to the matchlesse deceased Mr. Thomas Coriat. The Profits arising by Hemp-seed are Cloathing, Food, Fishing, Shipping, Pleasure, Profit, Iustice, Whipping. DEDICATED TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFULL, Paternes and Patrons of honest endeuours, Sir Thomas Hovvet, and Sir Robert Wiseman Knights: And to the worthy Gentleman, M?. Iohn Wiseman, Health, Mirth, and Happinesse, be euer attendants. A Preamble, Preatrot, Preagallop, Preavack, Preapace, or Preface; and Proface my Masters, if your stomackes serue. Booke, goe thy wayes, and honest mirth prouoke: And spightfull spirits with Melancholy choake. Booke, J command thee, where thou dost resort, To be the bad mens terrour, good mens sport. Neere as thou canst, J pray thee doe not misse, But make them vnderstand what Hempseed is. Me thinkes I heare some knauish foolish head, Accuse, condemne, and judge before hee read: Saying, the fellow that the same hath made, Is a mechanicke Waterman by trade: And therefore it cannot worth reading be, Being compil'd by such anone as he. Another spends his censure like Tom ladle, (Brings in his fiue egs, foure of which are adle) Mewes and makes faces, yet scarce knowes whats what: Hemp-seed (quoth he) what can be writ of that? Thus these deprauing minds their iudgements scatter Eyther against the Writer or the Matter. But let them (if they please) reade this Preamble, And they will finde that J haue made a scamble To shew my poore plentious want of skill, How Hemp-seed doth deserue, preserue, and kill. I muse that neuer any exc'lent wit Of this forgotten subiect yet hath writ. The theame is rich, although esteemed meane, Not scurrulous, prophane, nor yet obsceane. And such as taske may well become a quill To blaze it, that hath all the grounds of skill. This worke were no dishonour or abuse, To Homer, Ouid, or to Maroes Muse. A thousand Writers for their art renown'd Haue made farre baser things their studies ground. That men haue cause to raile 'gainst fruitlesse Rimes, (Uainely compil'd in past and present times,) And say, O Hemp-seed, how art thou forgotten By many Poets that are dead and rotten? And yet how many will forget the still, Till they put on a Tyburne Pickadill. The Names of most of such Authors or their Workes, as haue writ vpon many poore subiects. Erasmus, that great Clerke of Rotterdam, Jn praise of Folly many liues did frame: The summe and pith of all his whole intents Showes Fooles are guilty, and yet Innocents. Another, briefly, barely did relate The naked honour of a bare bald Pate: And for there's not a haire twixt them and heau'n, The title of tall men to them is giuen: And sure they put their foes in such great dread. That none dares touch a haire vpon their head. Mountgomerie, a fine Scholler did compile The Cherry and the Sloe in learned stile. Homer wrote brauely of the Frog and Rat, And Virgil versifi'd vpon a Gnat. Ouid set forth the Art of lustfull Loue. Another wrote the Treatise of the Doue. One with the Grashopper doth keepe a rut. Another rimes vpon a Hazell Nut. One with a neat Sophisticke Paradoxe Sets forth the commendations of the Poxe. Signeur Inamorato's Muse doth sing In honour of his Mistres Gloue or Ring, Her Maske, her Fanne, her Pantofle, her Glasse, Her Anything, can turne him to an Asse. Plinie and Aristotle write of Bees. Some write of Beggeries twenty foure degrees. One of the Owle did learnedly endite, And brought the Night-bird welcome to day-light. A second did defend with tooth and nayle, The strange contentment men may find in Jayle. A third doth the third Richard much commend, And all his bloudy actions doth defend. A fourth doth shew his wits exceeding quicknesse, In praise of Tauerne-healths and Drunken sicknesse. A fift doth toyle his Muse quite out of breath, Of aduerse Fortune, banishment or death. A sixt the very Firmament doth harrow, Writes of the Parrat, Popinjay and Sparrow, The Storke, the Cuckoe: Nothing can escape, The Horse, the Dog, asse, foxe, ferret, and the ape. Mounsieur de Gallia, writes all night till noone, Commending highly Tennis or Baloone. Anothers Muse as high as Luna flies, In praise of hoarsnesse, dropsies, and bleare-eyes. The Gout, Sciatica, scab'd hams, small legs: Of thred-bare cloukes, a jewes-trump, or potch'd egges. One, all his wit at once, in Rime discloses The admirable honour of red-noses: And how the nose magnificat doth beare A tincture, that did neuer colour feare, One doth heroicke it throughout our coast, The vertue of muld-sacke, and ale and toast. Another takes great paines with inke and pen, Approuing fat men are true honest men. One wakes the haughty vauty welkin ring In praise of Custards, and a bag pudding. Another, albe labours inke and paper, Exalting Dauncing, makes his Muse to caper. Anothers humour will nothing allow To bee more profitable then a Cow, Licking his lips, in thinking that his theame Js milke, cheese, butter, whay, whig, curds, and creame, Leather and Ueale, and that which is most chiefe Tripes, chitterlings, or fresh powder'd beefe. A number haue contagiously rehearsed And on Tobacco vapouriz'd and vearsed, Maintaining that it was a drug deuine Fit to be seru'd by all the Sisters nine. Yet this much of it, J shall euer thinke, The more men stirre in it, the more 'twill stinke. A learned Knight, of much esteeme and worth, A pamphlet of a Priuie did set forth, Which strong breath'd Ajax was well lik'd, because Twas writ with wit and did deserue applause. One wrote the Nightingale and lab'ring Ant, Another of the Flea and th'Elephant. Tom Nash a witty pamphlet did endite In praise of Herrings, both the red and write. And some haue writ of Maggots and of Flies A world of fables, fooleries, and lies. And this rare Hempseed that such profit brings, To all estates of subiects, and of Kings, Which rich commoditie if man should lacke, He were not worth a shirt vnto his backe. And shall it no tryumphant honour haue, But lye dead, buried in obliuions graue? Some Critticks will perhaps my writing tax With falshood, and maintaine their shirts are flax, To such as those, my answer shall be this, That Flax the male and Hemp the female is, And their engendring procreatiue seed A thousand thousand helpes for man doth breed. And as a man by glauncing vp his eye Sees in the aire a flocke of wilde Geese flye: And ducke, and woodcocks, of both sexes be Though men doe name but one, for breuity. There's ganders 'mongst the geese, hens with the cocks, Drakes with the ducks, all male and female stocks, The Ewe, the Ram, the Lambe, and the fat weather, Jn generall are called sheepe together. Harts, Stags, Bucks, Does, Hinds, Roes, Fawnes, euery where Are in the generality call'd Deere. So Hemp and Flax, or which you list to name Are male and female, both one, and the same. Those that 'gainst these comparisons deride, And will not with my lines be satisfide, Let them imagine e're they doe condemne I loue to play the foole with such as them. The cause why Hempseed hath endur'd this wrong And hath its worthy praise obscur'd so long, I doe suppose it to bee onely this That Poets know their insufficience is, That were earth Paper, and Sea inke, they know 'Twere not enough great Hempseeds worth to show, I muse the Pagans, with varietie, Of godles Gods, made it no Deity. Heere followes the names of most of the heathen Gods and Idols. The Ægyptians to a Bull, they Apis nam'd A temple most magnificent they fram'd, The Ibis, Crocodile, a cat, a dog, The Hippopostamy, beetles, or a frog. Jchneumons, dragons, the wolfe, aspe, eele, and Ram, (Base beastly gods, for such curst sonnes of Cham,) Who were so with Jdolatry misled, They worship'd Onions, and a garlike head. If these people had tasted but a messe of Tewxbury mustard they would surely haue honoured it for a God or feared it as a Diuell. King Ieroboam for his gods did take, Two golden calues, and the true God forsake. The Philistins, and the Assirians, The Persians and Babilonians, Samaritans, and the Arabians, The Thebans, Spartans, and Athenians, The Indians, Parthians, and the Libians The Britaines, Gallians, and Hibernians: Since the first Chaos, or creation Idolatry hath crept in euery Nation, And as the diuell did mens minds inspire, Some worshipt, earth, some aire, or water, fire, Windes, Riuers, Rainbow, Stars, and Moone and Sun: Ceres, and Bacchus riding on his tun, Mars, Saturne, Ioue, Apollo, Mercury; Priapus and the Queene of lechery, Vulcan, Diana, Pluto, Proserpine, Pomona, Neptune, and Pans piping shrine: Old Belaam Berecynthia: Stones and Trees Bewitched creatures worshipt on their knees. Baal, Baalzebub, Nisroth, the Diuell, and Dagon, Ashtaroth, Rimmon, Belus, Bell, the Dragon: Flies, fooles, hawkes, madmen; any thing they saw: Their very Priuies they did serue with awe: And they did sacrifice, at sundry feasts Their children vnto diuels, stockes, stones and beasts. O had these men the worth of Hampseed knowne, Their blinded zeale (no doubt) they would haue showne Jn building Temples, and would alters frame, Like Ephesus to great Dianaes name. And therefore Merchants, Marriners, people all Of all trades, on your marrow bones downe fall: For you could neither rise, or bite or sup, If noble Hempseed did not hold you vp. And Reader now J thinke it is fit time To come vnto the matter with my rime. But iudge not till you haue well read and scan'd. And askt your selues if you doe vnderstand: And if you can, doe but this sauour shew Make no ill faces, crynct tush and mew: For though I dare not brag, I dare maintaine True censurers will iudge J haue tane paine. Unto the wise J humbly doe submit: For those that play the fooles for want of wit, My poore reuenge against them still shall be. Jle laugh at them whilst they doe scoffe at me. THE PRAISE OF HEMP-SEED: WITH The Uoyage of Mr. Roger Bird and the Writer hereof, in a Boat of browne-Paper, from London to Quanborough in Kent. Sweet sacred Muses, my inuention raise Vnto the life, to write great Hempseeds praise. This grain growes to a stalk, whose coat or skin Good industry doth hatchell, twist, and spin, And for mans best aduantage and auailes It makes clothes, cordage, halters, ropes and sailes. From this small Atome, mighty matters springs, It is the Art of nauigations wings; It spreads aloft, the lofty skie it scales, Flies o're the great Leuiathan and Whales, Diues to the boundlesse bottome of the deepe, Wher Neptune doth mongst dreadful monsters keep. From Pole to pole, it cuts both Seas and Skyes, From th'orient to the occident it flyes. Kings that are sandred farre, by Seas and Lands, It makes them in a manner to shake hands. It fils our Land with plenty wonderfull, From th'Esterne Jndie, from the great Mogull, From France, from Portingale, from Venice, Spaine, From Denmarke, Norway, it scuds o're the maine, Vnto this Kingdome it doth wealth acrue From beyond China, farre beyond Peru. From Belgia, Almaine, the West Jndies, and From Guiny, Biny, Island, New found-land, This little seed is the great instrument To shew the power of God Omnipotent, Whereby the glorious Gospell of his Sonne, Millions misled soules hath from Sathan wonne. It is an instrument by the appointment of God for the encrease of the Gospell of Christ. Those that knew no God in the times of yore, Now they their great Creator doe adore. And many that did thinke they did doe well To giue themselues a sacrifice to Hell, And seru'd the Diuell with th'inhumane slaughters, Of their vnhappy haplesse sonnes and daughters. Now they the remnant of their liues doe frame To praise their Makers and Redeemers name. Witnesse Virginia, witnesse many moe, Witnesse our selues few hundred yeares agoe, When in Religion, and in barbarous natures, We were poore wretched misbeleeuing creatures. How had Gods Preechers saild to sundry coasts, T'instruct men how to know the Lord of Hosts? But for the Sayles which he with wind doth fill. As Seruants to accomplish his great will. But leauing this high supernaturall straine, I'le talke of Hempseed in a lower vaine. How should we haue gold, siluer, jems, or Iewels, Wine, oyle, spice, rice, and diuers sorts of fewels: Food for the belly, cloathing for the backe, Silke, Sattin, Veluet, any thing we lacke, To serue necessities? How should we get Such sorts of plenteous fish, but with the net? The Smelt, Roach, Salmon, Flounder and the Dace, Would in fresh riuers keepe their dwelling place. The Ling, Cod, Herring, Sturgeon, such as these Would liue and dye in their owne natiue Seas. Without this seed the Whale could not be caught, Whereby our oyles are out of Greenland brought. Nay wer't not for the net made of this seed, Men could not catch a Sprat whereon to feed. Besides, it liberally each where bestowes A liuing vpon thousands where it growes; As beaters, Spinners, Weauers, and a crue Of haltermakers which could scarce liue true, But for th'imployment which this little graine Doth vse them in, and payes them for their paine. Mirth and Truth are good companions. The Rope makers, the Net makers, and all Would be trade falne, for their trade would fall. Besides, what multitudes of Fishers are In euery Sea-towne, numbers past compare, Whilest they their seruants, children and their wiues From Hempseeed get their liuing all their liues. The Fish mangers would quickly goe to wrack, The lacke of this seed would be their great lack, And being now rich, and in good reputation, They would haue neither Hall nor Corporation. And all that they could buy, or sell, or barter, Would scarce be worth a Gubbin once a quarter. The mounting Larke, that seemes so high to flye, Vntill she seemes no greater then a Flie; And to the flaming Sunne doth chirp and prate, Doth in the net come to her ending date, My neighbour Woodcocke, buzzard and the Gull, And Philip Sparrow all most plentifull. All sorts of faire fowle, or the foulest fowle From the degree of the Eagle to the Owle, Are with ingenuous jins, grins, nets and snares For mans reliefe oft taken vnawares: Deeres, Hares, and Conies would too much abound, And ouer-run the beating breeding ground, And Weezels, Polcats, Wildcats, Stoats and such Like spoyling Vermin, would annoy men much, But for toyles, hayes, for traps, for snares and grins, Which brings vs food and profit by their skins. No Plowman liues beneath the azure Cope, But for his plough or cart must vse the rope: No Hostler liues in ours, or other Lands, But makes the halters Horses falling bands. Bels would hang dead within the loftie steeple And neuer call to Church forgetfull people, Mute like a bagbite, that hath lost his bag, Except the Bell ropes made the clappers wag. It were an endlesse taske to goe about it, To reckon those that cannot liue without it. Alasse what would our silken Mercers be? What could they doe (sweet Hempseed) but for thee? Rash, Taffata, Paropa, and Nouato, Shagge, Fillizetta, Damaske and Mockado, No Veluets Piles, two Piles, pile and halfe Pile, No Plush, or Grograines could adorne this Ile, No cloth of siluer, Gold, or Tisue, here: Philip and Cheiny neuer would appeare Within our bounds, nor any Flanders-serge Could euer come within our Kingdomes verge: Should Mercers want these things with diuers more Their trade were nothing or else very poore. This seed doth helpe the Grocer euery season, Or else his wisedome could not yeeld a reison; He could not long be Currant in his state, And (scarcely worth a fig) would end his Date. For Cloues his credit would be clouen quick, Nor from the loafe or lumpe, his lips could licke: No Nutmegs, Liquoris, or biting graines Or Almons for a Parrat, were his gaines, Sans Ginger weakely he would run his Race, And Powltry Mace, would put downe Indian Mace: And he vnable (through his want of pelfe) To pepper vs, or yet to prune himselfe. The Draper of his wealth would much be shorted. But that our cloathes and Kersies are transported, Our cottons, penistones, frizadoes, baze, Our sundry sorts of frizes, blackes and grayes. And linnen Drapers but for transportation, Could hardly Canuase out their occupation. Hempseed doth yeeld or else it doth allow Lawne, Cambricke, Holland, Canuase, Callico, Normandy, Hambrough, strong poledauis, Lockram. And to make vp the Rime (with reason) Buckram. The Goldsmiths trade would totter and vnsettle, And he could be a man of no good mettle, Were't not for Sailes and Ropes that Ships doe rig, That bring gold, siluer, many a Sow and Pig; Which makes them by an admirable skill To liue by that which many a Horse doth kill, Which is the A Goldsmith and a Taylor liue by that which will kill a horse.Fashions; for continually They sell the fashion, but they seldome buy. And braue wine Marchants, little were your gaine, By Mallegoes, Canaries Sacke from Spaine, Sweet Allegant, and the concocted Cute, Hollock and Tent would be of small repute. O all you Bachinalian drunkards honour Hemp-seed. Your Bastards their owne Fathers would forget, Nor they our Gossips lips no more would wet. The wind no Muskadine could hither bandy, Or sprightfull Malmesey out of fruitfull Candy. Liatica or Corsica could not From their owne bearing breeding bounds be got. Peter-se-mea, or head strong Charnico, Sherry, nor Rob-o-Dauy here could flow. The French Frontinitcke, Claret, Red nor White, Graues nor High-Country could ourhearts delight. No Gascoygne, Orleance, or the Chrystall Sherrant Nor Rhenish from the Rheine would be apparant. Thus Hempseed, w?? these wines, our land doth spread Which if we want, wine Marchants trades were dead. The Vintners trade were hardly worth a rush Vnable to hang vp a signe, or bush; And were't not for this small forgotten graine Their coniuring at midnight would be vaine. Anon, anon, would be forgotten soone, And he might score a pudding in the Moone, But not a pinte of Clarret in the Sunne, Because the emptie hogshead could not runne. His blushing lattice would looke pale and wan, Nor could he long be a well liquord man: No more could all his regiments of pots Affright men daily, with scores, bills, and shots. The Taylors trade would hardly get them bread If Hempseed did not furnish them with thread; And though it be a terror to most theeues Yet it this occupation neuer greeues, They loue it, black, brown, yellow greene, red, blew, Which is a signe, that Taylers must be true: The worthy Company, of warmelin'd Skinners Would in short space be miserable sinners It Hempseed did not oft supply their boxes With Russian Sables, Miniuers and Foxes: With Beares &amp; Budges; and rare powdered Ermines, And with the skins of diuers beasts and Vermines. The Habberdasher of small ware, would be In a small time, a man of small degree: If Hempseed did not helpe him by the great, Small would his gaines be, to buy cloathes or meat. Then might his wares be rightly tearmed small Which would be eyther few or none at all. And They might liue to dye poorely, but not dye to liue rich.Dyers though you doe no colours feare, 'Tis Hempseed that doth you to riches reare, Woad, Madder, Indico, and Cutcheneale, Brazil, and Logwood, and aboundant deale Of drugs, which did they not your wants supply, You could not liue, because you could not dye. Apothecaries were not worth a pin, If Hempseed did not bring their commings in; Oyles, Vnguents, Sirrops, Minerals, and Baulmes, (All Natures treasure, and th'Almighties almes,) Emplasters, Simples, Compounds, sundry drugs With Necromanticke names like fearefull Bugs, Fumes, Vomits, purges, that both cures, and kils, Extractions, conserues, preserues, potions, pils, Ellixers simples, compounds, distillations, Gums in abundance, brought from foraigne nations. A braue world for Physitions and Chyrurgions the while. And all or most of these sorenamed things Helpe, health, preseruatiues; and riches brings. There's many a Gallant dallying with a Drab, Hath got the Spanish pip, or Naples scab, The Gallia Morbus or the Scottish fleas, Or English Poxe, for all's but one disease. And though they were perfum'd with Ciuet hot Yet wanting these things they would stinke and rot, With gowts, Consumptions, Palsies, Lethargies, With apoplexies, quinzies, plurifies, Cramps, cataracts, the teare-throat cough and tisick From which, to health men are restor'd by Physicke, Agues, quotidian, quartane, tertian, or The leprosie, which all men doe abhor. The stone, strangury, botches, biles, or blaines, Head-aches, cankers, swimming of the braines, Ruptures, Hernia aquosa, or Carnosa, Or the Eolian hernia ventosa. All Dropsies, Collicks, Iaundizes, or Scabs, Gangrenaes, Vlcers, wounds, and mortall stabs. Illiaca passioes, Megrims, Mumps, or Mange, Contagious blouds, which throgh the veins do range Scurfes, meazles, murraines, fluxes, all these griefes, Transported medicines daily bring releefes, Most seruiceable Hempseed but for thee, These helpes for man could not thus scattered be. Tobacoes fire would soone be quenched out, Nor would it leade men by the nose about: Nor could the Merchants of such Heathen Docks From small beginnings purchase mighty stocks: By follies daily dancing to their pipe Their states from rotten stinking weeds grow ripe; By which meanes they haue into Lordships run The Clients being beggered and vndone: Who hauing smoak'd their Land to fire and ayre They whiffe and puffe themselues into dispaire. Ouid 'mongst all his Metomorphosis Ne're knew a transformation like to this, Nor yet could Oedipus e're vnderstand, How to turne Land to smoake, and smoake to Land. For by the meanes of this bewitening smother, One Element is turn'd into another, As Land to fire, fire, into Ayrie matter, From ayre (too late repenting) turnes to water. A strange change, and yet not stranger then for the women of these times to be turn'd to the shapes of men. By Hempseed thus fire water, aire, earth, all Are chang'd by pudding, leafe, roule, pipe and ball. Lip licking Comfit-makers, by whose trade, Dainties come thou to me are quickly made; Baboones, and hobby horses, and owles, and apes, Swans, geese, dogs, woodcocks, &amp; a world of shapes, Castles for Ladies, and for Carpet Knights, Vnmercifully spoyld at feasting fights, Where hattering bullets are fine sugred plums, No feare of roaring guns, or thundring drums: There's no tantara, sa sa sa, or force, Of man to man, or warlike horse to horse; No mines, no countermines, no pallizadoes, No parrapets, or secret ambuscadoes, Of bloud and wounds, and dismall piercing lances Men at this sight are free from such mischances. For many gallants guilded swords doe weare, Who fight these battels without wit or feare: All striuing as they did for honour thirst, All greedy which can giue the onset first; Each one contending in this Candied coyle, To take most prisoners, and put vp most spoyle. Sweet warres, and dangerous tooth-valours. Retiring neuer when they doe assaile, But most aduenturously with tooth and nayle, Raze, ruinate, demolish, and confound, The sugred fabricke leuell with the ground. And hauing layd the buildings thus along, They swallow downe, and pocket vp the wrong. That who so that way afterwards doe passe, Can see no signe where such a Castle was: For at these warres most commonly 'tis seene, Away the victors carry all things cleane. It fortunes in these battels now and then Women are better Souldiers farre then men: Such sweet mouth'd fights as these doe often fall After a Christning, or a Funerall. Thus Hempe the Comfit-makers doth supply, From them that newly liue, and newly dye. If the blacke Indians or Newcastle coales Came not in Fleets, like fishes in the sholes. The rich in gownes and rugs themselues might sold, But thousands of the poore might statue with cold. The commodities of these blacke Indies are worth more white money to vs, then eyther the East or West Indies will euer be profitable. Smiths, Brewers, Diers, all estates that liues, This little seed seruie or comfort giues. For why, our Kingdome could not serue our turne, For Londons vse, with wood seuen yeares to burne: And which way then could coales supply our need, But by th'Almighties bounty and this seed? You braue Neptunians, you salt water crew, Sea-plowing Marriners; I speake to you: From Hemp you for your selues and others gaine Your Sprit-sayle, fore-sayle, top-sayle, &amp; your maine, Top, and top-gallant, and your mizzen-abast, Your coursers, bonnets, drablers, fore and aft, The sheats, tacks, boliens, braces, halliars, tyes, Shrowds, ratlings, lanyards, tackles, lifts, and guies, Your martlines, ropeyarnes, gaskets, and your stayes, These for your vse, small Hemp-seed vp doth raise: The boirope, boatrope, guestrope, catrope, portrope The bucket rope, the boat-rope, long or short rope, The entering-rope, the top-rope (and the rest Which you that are acquainted with know best: The lines to sound in what depth you slide, Cables and hausers, by which ships doe ride: All these, and many moe then I can name, From this small seed, good industry doth frame. Ships, Barks, Hoyes, Drumlers, Craires, Boats, all would sink, But for the Ocum caulk'd in euery chink. Th'vnmatched Loadstone, and best figur'd Maps Might shew where foraine Countries are (perhaps) Thel Compasse (being rightly toucht) will show The thirty two points where the winds do blow; Men with the Iacobs staffe, and Astrolobe May take the height and circuit of the Globe: And sundry Art-like instruments looke cleare In what Horizon, or what Hemisphere Men sayle in through the raging ruthlesse deepe, And to what coast, such and such course to keepe; Guessing by th'Artike, or Antartike starre, Climates and countries being ne're so farre. But what can these things be of price or worth To know degrees, heights, depths, East. W.S. North What are all these but shadowes, and vaine hopes, If ships doe eyther want their Sailes or Ropes? And now ere I offend, I must confesse A little from my theame I will digresse; Striuing in verse to shew a liuely forme Of an impetuous gust, or deadly storme. Where vncontrouled Hyperborean blasts Teares all to tatters, Tacklings, Sailes, and Masts; Where boysterous puffes of Eurus breath did hiz And mongst our shrouds and cordage wildely whiz; Where thundering Joue amidst his lightning flashing Seem'd ouerwhelm'd with Neptunes mountaine dashing Where glorious Titan hath his burning light, Turning his bright Meridian to blacke night: Where blustring Eole blew confounding breath, And thunders fearefull larum threatned death, Where Skyes, and Seas, Haile, Wind, and slauering Sleet As if they all at once had meant to meet In fatall opposition, to expire The world, and vnto Chaos backe retire. Thus whilst the Winds and Seas contending gods, In rough robustious fury are at ods, The beaten ship tost like a forcelesse feather, Now vp, now downe, &amp; no man knowing whither: The Topmast some time tilting at the Moone, And being vp doth fall againe as soone, With such precipitating low descent, As if to hels blacke Kingdome downe she went, Poore ship that rudder. or no steerage feeles, Sober, yet worse then any Drunkard reeles, Vnmanag'd, guidlesse, too and fro she wallowes, Which (seemingly) the angry billowes swallowes. A storme. Midst darkenesse, lightning, thunder, fleet, and raine, Remorcelesse winds and, mercy-wanting Maine, Amazement, horror, dread from each mans face Had chas'd away liues bloud, and in the place Was sad despaire, with haire heau'd vp vpright With ashy visage, and with sad affright, As if grim Death with his all murdering dart, Had ayming beene at each mans bloudlesse heart, Out cryes the Master, lower the top-saile, lower, Then vp aloft runs scambling three or foure, But yet for all their hurly burly hast, E're they got vp, downe tumbles Saile and Mast. Veere the maine sheat there, then the Master cride, Let rise the fore tack, on the Larboord side: Take in the fore-sayle, yare, good fellowes, yare, Aluffe at helme there, ware no more, beware. Steere South, South East there, I say ware, no more, We are in danger of the Leeward shore, Cleere your maine brace, let goe the bole in there, Port, port, the helme hard, Romer come no neere. Sound, sound, heaue, heaue the lead, what depth, what depth? Fadom and a halfe, three all, Then with a whiffe, the winds againe doe puffe, And then the Master cries aluffe, aluffe, Make ready th'anker, ready th'anker hoe, Cleere, cleere the boighrope, steddy, well steer'd, so; Hale vp the boat, in Sprit-sayle there afore, Blow winde and burst, and then thou wilt giue o're, Aluffe, clap helme a lee, yea, yea, done, done, Downe, downe alow, into the hold, quicke runne. There's a planck sprung, somthing in hold did break. Pump bullies, Carpenters, quicke stop the leake. Once heaue the lead againe, and sound abaffe, A shafnet lesse, seuen all. Let fall the Ancker there, let fall, Man man the boat, a woat hale, vp hale, Top yet maine yard, a port, yeere cable alow, Ge way a head the boat there hoe, dee row, Well pumpt my hearts of gold, who sayes amends East and by South, West and by North she wends. This was a weather with a witnesse here, But now we see the skyes begin to cleare, To dinner hey, and lets at ancker ride, Till winds grow gentler, and a smoother tide. J thinke I haue spoken Heathen Greeke, Vtopian, or Bermudian, to a great many of my readers, in the description of this storme, but indeed J wrote it onely for the vnderstanding Mariners reading, I did it three yeares since, and could not finde a fitter place then this to insert it, or else it must haue laine in silence. But to proceed to my former theame of Hemp-seed. The Shoe-maker and Cobler with their Ends One alwayes makes, and t'other euer mends: Take away Hemp, the sole and vpper leather I know could neuer well be sow'd together. And for the Cobler it appeareth plaine That hee's the better workman of the twaine, For though a Shoomaker in art excell, And makes his shoes and boots neuer so well: Yet euermore it is the Coblers trade To mend the worke the Shoomaker hath made. The Character of a Cobler. The Cobler (like a Iustice takes) delight To set men that doe walke aside, vpright. And though he looke blacke as he carried coles, He daily mendeth desperate wicked soles: Though Crownes and Angels may perhaps be scant, Yet store of peeces he doth neuer want: And let his worke be ended well or ill, Here's his true honour, he is mending still. And this his life and occupation is, And thus he may thanke Hempseed for all this. For Hempseed if men rightly vnderstand, Is knowne the greatest Iustice in a Land: How could men trauaile safely, here and there, If Hempseed did not keepe a Theefe in feare; No man within his house could liue or rest For villaines, that would pilfer and molest, And breake downe walls, and rifle chests and truncks To maintaine drinking, dicing. Knaues and Punks: That many a one that's wealthy ouer night, Would e're the breake of day be begger'd quite: Worth thousands lately, now not worth a groat, And hardly scapes the cutting of his throat. No doubt but many a man doth liue and thriue, Which but (for Hemp-seed) would not be aliue; And many a wife and Virgin doth escape A rude deflouring, and a barbarous rape: Because the halter in their minds doe run, By whom these damned deeds would else be done. It is a balwarke to defend a Prince. It is a Subiects armour and defence: No Poniard, Pistoll, Halbert, Pike, or Sword Can such defensiue or sure guard afford. There's many a Rascall that would rob, purloine, Pick pockets, and cut purses, clip and coine, Doe any thing, or all things that are ill, If Hempseed did not curbe his wicked will. 'Tis not the breath or letter of the Law That could keepe Theeues rebellious wils in awe; For they (to saue their liues) can vse perswasions. Tricks, sleights, repriues, and many strange euasions. But tricke, repriue, or sleight nor any thing Could euer goe beyond a Hempen string. This is Lawes period, this at first was made To be sharpe Iustice executing blade. This string the Hangman monthly keepes in tune, More then the Cuckoes song in May or June, It doth his wardrobe, coine and stocke vpreare, In euery moneth and quarter of the years. Yet there hath beene two or three Sessions, wherein none hath beene executed: by which meanes he is in danger of breaking, or bankeruptisme; for the Hangmans trade is maintained by Iustice, and not by mercy. Besides it is an easie thing to proue, It is a soueraigne remedie for loue: As thus, suppose your thoughts at hourely strife Halfe mad, and almost weary of your life, All for the loue of some faire female creature, And that you are entangled with her feature, That you are sad, and glad, and mad and tame, Seeming to burne in frost, and freeze in flame, In one breath, sighing, singing, laughing, weeping, Dreame as you walke, and waking in your sleeping, Accounting houres for yeares, and moneths for ages, Till you enioy her, that your heart encages, And she hath sent you answers long before That her intent is not to be your whore: And you (for your part) meane vpon your life Ne're while you liue to take her for your wife. To end this matter, thus much I assure you, A Tiburne Hempen-caudell well will cure you. It can cure Traytors, but I hold it fit T'apply't ere they the treason doe commit: Wherefore in Sparta it ycleped was, Snickup, which is in English Gallow-grasse. The names that diuers Nations did attribute to Hemp-seed. The Libians call'd it Reeua, which implies It makes them dye like birds twixt earth and skyes, The name of Choak-wort is to it assign'd, Because it stops the venom of the mind. Some call it Neek-weed, for it hath a tricke To cure the necke that's troubled with the crick. For my part all's one, call it what you please, 'Tis soueraigne 'gainst each Common-wealth disease, And I doe wish that it may cure all those That are my Soueraignes and my Countries foes. And further, I would haue them search d and seene With care and skill when as their wounds be green, For if they doe to a Gangrena runne, There's little good by Hempseed can be done; For could I know mens hearts, I hold it reason To hang a Traytor in his thought of treason: For if his thought doe grow vnto an act It helpes not much to hang him for the fact. But that example may a terror strike To others, that would else attempt the like. To end this point of Hempseed, thus in briefe It helps a trueman, and it hangs a Theefe. Rates, Imposts, Customes of the Custome-house Would at the best rate scarce be worth a Louse: Goods in and out, which dayly ships doe fraight, By guesse, by tale, by measure and by weight. Which yearely to such mighty summes amount, In number numberlesse: or past account: Were't not for Hempseed, it doth plaine appeare These profits would not be a groat a yeare. The names of many braue discouerers: Sir Richard Grinuile, Charles, Earle of Nottingham, Henry Earle of South-hampton. Columbus, Cortois, Magellan, and Drake, Did with this seed their great discoueries make. Braue Hawkins, Baskeruile, Cauendish, Fennor, Best, Smith, Sherley, Rawleigh, Newport, and the rest, Web, Towerson, Willoughby, Sir Thomas Roe, The Lord 'la Ware, Frobusher, many moe. Nichols, and Malum, Rolph, and Midleton, And Sir Iames Lancaster, and Wirbringhton. And all the worthy things that these men did Without this seed had bin vndone, and hid, Fame ne're had trumpetted their noble fames And quite forgotten were their acts and names. The worlds seuen wonders, wer'e not for this grain In poore remembrance, or forgot had laine, The wals of Babel, sixty miles about, Two hundred foote in height, thicke fifty foot: Which Queene Samiramis in state did reare, Imployed three hundred thousand men ten yeare. Nor the great Image that at Rhodes was made Whose mettall did nine hundred Camels lade. The Pyramides of Ægypt, so renownd At th'foot in compasse forty acres ground: The which in making twenty yeares did then Imploy at worke thirty sixe thousand men. The Toomb of Mausoll, King of Carea Built by his Queene, (kind Artimesia) So wondrous made by art and workemanship That skill of man could neuer it outstrip; 'Twas long in building, and it doth appeare The charges of it full two millions were. Dianaes Temple built at Ephesus Had bin vnheard of, and vnknowne to vs, Which was two hundred twenty yeares in building With marble pillars and most sumptuous guilding. The image of Olimpique Jupiter, Had from Achaya not beene fam'd so farre, Nor Pharoes Watch towre w?? the world renownes Which cost 400.fourescore thousand crownes. Thus without Hemp-seed we had neuer knowne These things, nor could they to the world be shown. O famous Coriat, hadst thou come againe Thou wouldst haue told vs newes, direct and plaine, Of Tygers, Elephants, and Antelops And thousand other things as thicke as hops, Of men with long tailes, faced like to hounds, Of oysters, one whose fish weigh'd forty pounds, Of spiders greater then a walnut shell Of the Rhinoceros thou wouldst vs tell, Of horses tane with hawkes, of beares of buls, Of men with eares a span long, and of guls, As great as Swans, and of a bird call'd Ziz Whose egge will drown'd some threescore villages, Of cranes, and pigmies, lizzards, buzzards, owles, Of swine with hornes, of thousand beasts and foules. All these and more then I to minde can call Thou wouldst haue told vs, and much more then all, But that our expectations were preuented, By death, which makes thy friends much discontented. But farewell Thomas, neuer to returne Rest thou in peace within thy forraigne Vrne, Hempseed did beare thee o're the raging some And O I wish that it had brought thee home, For if thou hadst come backe, as I did hope, Thy fellow had not beene beneath the Cope. But we must loose that which we cannot saue. And freely leaue thee whom we cannot haue. I thinke it best to sow all our Land with itenery third yeare, for now our bread and drinke corne growing out of the excrements of beasts, makes vs to participate of their beastly natures, as when barly growes where swine haue dungd, those that drinke the ale or beere made of that malt, are many times as beastly as swine, and as drunke as hogs. Moreouer, Hempseed hath this vertue rare In making bad ground good, good corne to beare, It fats the earth, and makes it to excell No dung, or marle or mucke can do't so well: For in that Land which beares this happy seed In three yeares after it no dung will need, But sow that ground with barley, wheat, or rye And still it will encrease aboundantly; Besides, this much I of my knowledge know That where Hemp growes, no stinking weed can grow, No cockle, darnell, henbane, tare, or nettle Neere where it is can prosper, spring, or settle, For such antipathy is in this seed, Against each fruitlesse vndeseruing weed, That it with feare and terror strikes them dead, Or makes them that they dare not shew their head. And as in growing it all weeds doth kill So being growne, it keepes it nature still, For good mens vses serues, &amp; still releiues And yeelds good whips and ropes for rogues and theeues. I could rehearse of trades a number more Which but for Hempseed quickly would grow poore; As Sadlers for their elks haire to stuffe their sadles, And girses, and a thousand fidle fadles; But that Ile put my Reader out of doubts, What a rich thing it is being worne to clouts: For now how it to Paper doth conuert My poore vnable Muse shall next insert. And therefore noble and ignoble men Iudge gently of the progresse of my pen, Jn forma pauperis, poore men may sue, And I in forme of paper speake to you. But paper now's the subiect of my booke, And from whence paper its beginning tooke; How that from little Hemp and flaxen seeds, Ropes, halters, drapery, and our napery breeds, And from these things by art and true endeauour, All paper is deriued, whatsoeuer. For when I thinke but how is paper made Into Phylosophy I straightwayes wade: How here, and there, and euery where lyes scatter'd, Old ruin'd rotten rags, and ropes all tatter'd. And some of these poore things perhaps hath beene The linnen of some Countesse or some Queene, Yet lyes now on the dunghill, bare and poore Mix'd with the rags of some baud, theefe, of whore. And as these things haue beene in better states Adorning bodies of great Potentates, And lyes cast off, despised, scorn'd, deiected, Trod vnder foot, contemn'd and vnrespected, By this our vnderstandings may haue seeing That earthly honour hath no certaine beeing. For who can tell from whence these tatters springs? May not the torne shirt of a Lords or Kings Be pasht and beaten in the Paper mill And made Pot-paper by the workemans skill? May not the linnen of a Tyburne slaue, More honour then a mighty Monarch haue: That though he dyed a Traitor most disloyall His shirt may be transform'd to Paper-royall? And may not dirty socks from of the feet From thence be turn'd to a Crowne-paper sheet? And dunghill rags, by fauour, and by hap, May be aduanc'd aloft to sheets of cap? As by desert, by fauour and by chance Honour may fall, and begg'ry may aduance, Thus are these tatters allegoricall Tropes, types, and figures, of mans rise or fall. Thus may the reliques of sincere Diuines Be made the ground-worke of lasciuious lines, And the cast smocke that chast Lucretia wore Beare baudy lines betwixt a knaue and whore. Thus may a Brownists zealous ruffe in print Be turn'd to Paper, and a play writ in't. Or verses of a May pole, or at last Iniunctions for some stomacke hating Fast. And truely 'twere prophane and great abuse, To turne the brethrene linnen to such vse, As to make Paper on't to beare a song, Or Print the Superstitious Latine tongue, Apocrypha, or Ember-weekes, or Lent, No holy brother surely will consent To such Idolatry, his spirit and zeale Will rather trouble Church, and common-weale. He hates the Fathers workes, and had much rather To be a bastard, then to haue a Father. His owne interpretation he'll affoord According to the letter of the word, Tropes, Allegories, Types, similitudes, Or Figures, that some mysticke sense includes. His humour can the meaning so vnfold, In other fashions then the Fathers could: For he (dogmatically) doth know more Then all the learned Doctors knew before. All reuerend Ceremonies he'l oppose, He can make an Organ of his nose, And spin his speech with such sincerity, As if his bridge were falne in verity. The Cope and Surplesse he cannot abide, Against the corner-Cap he out hath cride, And calls them weeds of Superstition, And liueries of the whore of Babylon. The Crosses blessing he esteemes a curse, The Ring in marriage, out vpon't 'tis worse. And for his kneeling at the Sacrament, In sooth he'le rather suffer banishment, And goe to Amsterdamd, and liue and dye E're he'l commit so much Idolatry. He takes it for an outward Seale or Signe, A little consecrated bread and wine, And though it from his blessed Sauiour come His manners takes it sitting on his bum. The Spirit still directs him how to pray, Nor will he dresse his meat the Sabbath day, Which doth a mighty mysterie vnfold, His zeale is hot, although his meat be cold, Suppose his Cat on Sunday kill a Rat, She on the Munday must be hang'd for that. His faith keepes a continuall Holy day, Himselfe doth labour to keepe it at play: For he is read and deeply vnderstood That if his faith should worke 'twould doe no good, A fine cleane fingerd faith must saue alone, Good workes are needlesse, therefore he'l do none. Yet patience doth his spirit so much inspire, He'l not correct a Seruant in his ire, But when the spirit his hot furie layes. Hee congregates his folkes, and thus he sayes: Attend good Nichodemus, and Tobias, List to your reuerend Master Ananias, And good Aminadab, I pray attend, Here's my man Jsmael highly did offend; He told a lye, I heard his tongue to trip, For which most surely he shall tast the whip. Then after some sententious learned speech, The seruant humbly doth let fall his breech, Mounts on his fellowes backe as on a Mule, Whilst his pure Maister mounts his rod of rule. The boy in lying with his tongue did faile, And thus he answers for it with his taile. O Vpright, Sincere, Holy execution, Most patient, vnpolluted absolution. Shall Paper made of linnen of these men, Be stain'd with an vnsanctified pen? In sooth who ere doth so, bee't he or she, They little better then the wicked be, Children of Sathan and abhomination, The brood of Belials cursed congregation, The bastard off spring of the purple whore, Who doe the Babylonish Beast adore. From the Creation to the generall Flood, The name of Paper no man vnderstood: But by tradition still from Sire to Son, Men liuing knew the deeds by dead men done. Yet many things were in the Deluge sau'd In stony Pillars charactered and grau'd. For the most part antiquity agrees, Long since the floud men writ in barkes of trees: Which was obseru'd late in America, When Spanish Cortois conquered Mexica. Then after in Fig-leaues and Sicamour, Men did in Characters their minds explore. How when it is worne to Rags, it is made into Paper. Long after, as ingenuous spirits taught, Rags and old Ropes were to perfection wrought Into square formes yet how to giue a name Vnto their workemanship they could not frame. The Originall of Paper. Some Authors doe the name of Paper gather, To be deriu'd from Papæ, or a Father, Because a learned man of Arrius sect Did Christendome with herefie infect: And being in great errors much mistooke, Writ and divulged in a Paper booke. And therefore Nimphshag thus much doth inferre, The name of Paper sprung from Papæ err. Some hold the name doth from a Rush proceed, Which on Egiptian Nilus bankes doth breed: Which Rush is call'd Papirus for on it Th'Egiptian people oftentimes had writ. And some againe of lesse authoritie Because it's made of rags and pouerty, In stead of Paper name it Panperis, But sure me thinkes they take their markes amisse, For foure and twenty sheets doe make a Quire, And twenty Quire doth to a Reame aspire, And euery Reame were Kingdomes for their strength But that they want a single (l) in length. A Reame of Paper therefore keepes great port, And were a Realme, wer't not an (l) too short. Besides, we haue an old Prognosticater, An erring Father, quasi erra Pater. His euerlasting Almanack tels plaine, How many miles from hence to Charles his waine. From Luna vnto Mercury how farre To Uenus, Sol, and Mars that warlike starre: From Mars to merry thunder-thumping Ioue: And thence to sullen Saturne highest aboue: This if I lye not, with aduice and leasure, Old Erra Pater to an inch did measure. But hollow Muse what mounted to the sky, I'le clip your soaring plumes for you and I Must talke of Paper, Hemp, and such as this, And what a rich commodity it is. It was time to remember my selfe, for I was a degree too high. The best is I haue elbow roome to trace, I am not tide to times, to bounds, or place, But Europe, Asia, Sun-burnt Affrica, America, Terra incognita, The Christians, Heathens, Pagans, Turkes &amp; Iewes, And all the world yeelds matter to my Muse: No Empire, Kingdome, Region, Prouince, Nation, No Principality, Shire, nor Corporation: No Country, County, City, Hamlet, Towne, But must vse Paper, eyther white or browne. No Metropolitane, or gracious Primate No Village, Pallace, Cottage, function, Climate. No age, sex, or degree the earth doth beare, But they must vse this seed to write or weare.

Of Monarchies and wonders. How should we know the change of Monarchies, Th'Assyrian and the Persian Emperies, Great Alexanders large, small lasting glory Or Romes high Cæsars often changing story? How should Chronologies of Kings be knowne Of eyther other Countries, or our owne? Phylosophers, Hystorians, Chronographers, Poets ancient and moderne, the best sort mentioned.

Or Orators Hystorians, euery one In Paper made their worthy studies knowne. Who euer went beyond our famous King Whose Art throughout the spacious world doth ring; Such a Diuine, and Poet, that each State Admires him whom they cannot imitate. In Paper, many a Poet now suruiues Or else their lines had perish'd with their liues. Old Chancer, Gower, and Sir Thomas More, Sir Philip Sidney who the Lawrell wore, Spencer, and Shakespeare did in Art excell, Sir Eward Dyer, Greene, Nash, Daniel, Siluester, Beaumont, Sir Iohn Harington, Forgetfulnesse their workes would ouer run, But that in Paper they immortally Doe liue in spight of Death, and cannot dye. And many there are liuing at this day Which doe in paper their true worth display: As Dauis, Drayton, and the learned Dun, Johnson, and Chapman, Marston, Middleton, With Rowley, Fletcher, Withers, Massinger, Heywood, and all the rest where e're they are, Must say their lines but for the paper sheete Had scarcely ground, whereon to set their feete. Acts, Statutes, Lawes would be consum'd and lost All right and order topsy-turuy tost: Oppression, wrong, destruction and confusion Wer't not for Paper, were the worlds conclusion.

How many liue by it being Paper. All this and more is paper, and all this, From fruitfull Hempseed still produced is. Were't not for rags of this admired Lint, Dead were the admirable Art of Print. Nor could the Printers with their formes &amp; proofes. Worke for their owne and other mens behoofes. Octauo, Quarto, Folio, or sixteene: Twelues, nor yet sixty foure had e're beene seene, Nor could their Pages be the meanes to feed And cloth them and their families at need. The Stationer that liues, and gaineth well, And doth the word of God, both buy and sell, I know not which way he could liue and eate, If printed paper did not yeeld him meat. Some foolish knaue (I thinke) at first began The slander that three Taylers are one man: When many a Taylers boy, I know hath beene, Hath made tall men much fearefull to be seene, The boy hath had no weapon, nor no skill, But armed with a Taylers Paper-bill, Which being edgd with Jtems, stiffnings facings, With Bumbast, cottons, linenings, and with laceings, The boy hath made a man his head to hide And not the bare sight of the Bill abide. When boyes with paper Bils frights men so sore, 'Tis doubtlesse but their Masters can doe more, And many millions both of boyes and men, Doe onely liue, and flourish with the pen: Yet though the pen be through the world renown'd 'Twere nothing except paper were the ground. All Lawyers from the high'st degree or marke, Vnto the lowest Barrester or Clarke. How could they doe if paper did not beare The memory of what they speake or heare? And Iustice Clarkes could hardly make strong warrants. For Theeues, or Baudes, or whores, or such like arrants, But that in Paper 'tis their onely vse To write, and right the Common-wealths abuse. Thus much of Paper here my Muse hath said, But yet if all its profits were displaid, Ten Paper Mils could not affoord enough To write vpon in praise of writing stuffe. A Uoyage in a Paper-boat from London to Quinborough. I therefore to conclude this much will note How I of Paper lately made a Boat, And how informe of Paper I did row From London vnto Quinborough Ile show. I and a Vintner (Roger Bird by name) (A man whom Fortune neuer yet could tame) Tooke ship vpon the vigill of Saint Iames And boldly ventur'd downe the Riuer Thames, Lauing and cutting through each raging billow, (In such a Boat which neuer had a fellow) Hauing no kinde of mettall or no wood To helpe vs eyther in our Ebbe or Flood: For as our boat was paper so our Oares Were Stock-fish, caught neere to the Island shores. Stock-fishes vnbeaten, bound fast to two Canes with packthread. Thus being Oar'd and shipt away we went. Driuing 'twixt Essex Calues, and sheepe of Kent: Our Boat a female vessell gan to leake Being as female vessels are, most weake, Yet was shee able which did greeue me sore, To drowne Hodge Bird and I and forty more. The water to the Paper being got, In one halfe houre our boat began to rot: The Thames (most lib'rall) fild her to the halues, Whilst Hodge and I sate liquor'd to the calues. In which extremity I thought it fit To put in vse a stratagem of wit, Which was, eight Bullocks bladders we had bought Puft stifly full with wind, bound fast and tought. Which on our Boat within the Tide we ty'de, Of each side foure, vpon the outward side. The water still rose higher by degrees. In three miles going, almost to our knees, Our rotten bottome all to tatters sell, And left our boat as bottomlesse as Hell. And had not bladders borne vs stifly vp, We there had tasted of deaths fatall cup. And now (to make some sport) Ile make it knowne By whose strong breath my bladders all were blown. One by a cheuerell conscienc'd Vsurer, Another by a drunken Bag piper, The third a Whore, the fourth a Pander blew, The fift a Cutpurse, of the Cursed crew, The sixt, a post-knight that for fiue groats gaine Would sweare &amp; for foure groats forsweare't againe. The seauenth was an Informer, one that can By informations begger any man. The eight was blowne vp by a swearing Royster, That would cut throats as soone as eate an Oyster. We had more winds then the Compasse, for we had eight seuerall winds in our bladders, and the 32 of the Compasse in all 40. We being in our watry businesse bound, And with these wicked winds encompass'd round, For why such breaths as those it fortunes euer, They end with hanging, but with drowning neuer; And sure the bladders bore vs vp so tight, As if they had said, Gallowes claime thy right. This was the cause that made vs seeke about, To finde these light Tiburnian vapours out. We could haue had of honest men good store, As Watermen, and Smiths, and many more, But that we knew it must be hanging breath, That must preserue vs from a drowning death. Carefully and discreetly prouided. Yet much we fear'd the graues our end would be Before we could the Towne of Grauesend see: Our boat drunke deepely with her dropsie thirst, And quaft as if she would her bladders burst, Whilst we within fixe inches of the brim (Full of salt water) downe (halfe sunck) did swim. Thousands of people all the shores did hide, And thousands more did meet vs in the tide With Scullers, Oares, with ship boats, &amp; with Barges To gaze on vs, they put themselues to charges. Thus did we driue, and driue the time away, Till pitchy night had driuen away the day: The Sun vnto the vnder world was fled: The Moone was loath to rise, and kept her bed, The Starres did twinckle, but the Ebon clouds Their light, our sight, obscures and ouershrowds. The tossing billowes made our boat to caper, Our paper forme scarce being forme of paper, The water foure mile broad, no Oares, to row, Night darke, and where we were we did not know. And thus 'twixt doubt and feare, hope and despaire I fell to worke, and Roger Bird to prayer. And as the surges vp and downe did heaue vs, He cry'd most feruently, good Lord receiue vs. I pray'd as much, but I did worke and pray, And he did all he could to pray and play. Thus three houres darkeling I did puzzell and toile Sows'd and well pickl'd, chafe and muzzell &amp; moile, Drench'd with the swassing waues, &amp; stew'd in sweat Scarce able with a cane our boat to set, At last (by Gods great mercy and his might) The morning gan to chase away the night. Aurora made vs soone perceiue and see We were three miles below the Towne of Lee. And as the morning more end more did cleare, The sight of Quinborogh castle did appeare. That was the famous monumentall marke, To which we striu'd to bring our rotten barke: The onely ayme of our intents and scope, The anker that brought Roger to the Hope. He dwelleth now at the Hope on the Banck-side. Thus we from Saturday at euening Tide, Till Monday morne, did on the water bide, In rotten paper and in boysterous weather, Darke nights, through wet, and toyled altogether. But being come to Quinborough and aland, I tooke my fellow Roger by the hand, And both of vs ere we two steps did goe Gaue thankes to God that had preseru'd vs so: Confessing that his mercy vs protected When as we least deseru'd, and lesse expected. The Maior of Quinborough in loue affords To entertaine vs, as we had beene Lords; It is a yearely feast kept by the Maior, And thousand people thither doth repaire, From Townes and Villages that's neere about, And 'twas our lucke to come in all this rout. I'th'street, Bread, Beere, and Oysters is their meat, Which freely, friendly, shot-free all doe eat. But Hodge and I were men of ranck and note, We to the Maior gaue our aduenturous boat; The which (to glorifie that Towne of Kent) He meant to hang vp for a monument. He to his house inuited vs to dine, Where we had cheare on cheare, and wine on wine, And drinke, and fill, and drinke, and drinke and fill, With welcome vpon welcome, welcome still. But whilst we at our dinners thus were merry, The Country people tore our tatter'd wherry In mammocks peecemeale in a thousand scraps, Wearing the reliques in their hats and caps. That neuer traytors corps could more be scatter'd By greedy Rauens, then our poore boat was tatter'd; Which when the Maior did know, he presently Tooke patient what he could not remedie. The next day we with thankes left Quinbroghs coast And hied vs home on horse-backe all in post. Thus Master Birds strange voyage was begun, With greater danger was his mony won. And those that doe his coine from him detaine (Which he did win with perill and much paine) Let them not thinke that e're 'twill doe them good, But eate their marrow and consume their blood. The worme of conscience gnaw them euery day That haue the meanes, and not the will to pay. Those that are poore, and cannot, let them be Both from the debt and malediction free. Thus (I in part) what Hemp-seed is haue showne. Cloth, ropes, rags, paper, poorely is made knowne: How it maintaines each kingdome, state and trade, And how in paper we a voyage made. I therefore to conclude, thinke not amisse To write something of Thames, or Thamasis, The names of the most famous riuers in the world. Maze, Rubicon, Elue, Volga, Ems, Scamander, Loyre, Moldoue, Tyber, Albia, Seyne, Meander, Hidaspes, Jndus, Jnachus, Tanaies, (Our Thames true praise is sarre beyond their praise) Great Euphrates, Iordane, Nilus, Ganges, Poe, Tagus and Tygris, Thames doth farre out-goe. Danubia, Jster, Xanthus, Lisus, Rhrine, Wey, Seuerne, Auon, Medway, Isis, Tine, Dee, Ouze, Trent, Humber, Eske, Tweed, Annan, Tay, Firth (that braue Demy-ocean) Clide, Dun, Spay, All these are great in fames, and great in names, But great'st in goodnesse is the riuer Thames, From whose Diurnall and Nocturnall flood Millions of soules haue fewell cloathes and food; Which from twelue houres to twelue doth still succeed, Hundreds, &amp; thousands both to cloath &amp; feed. Of watermen, their seruants, children, wiues, It doth maintaine neere twenty thousand liues. I can as quickly number all the starres, As reckon all things in particulars: Which by the bounty of th'All-giuing giuer Proceeds from this most matchlesse, famous Riuer. And therefore 'tis great pirty, shelfe or sand From the forgetfull and ingratefull land, Should it's cleare chrystall entrailes vilefy, Or soyle such purenesse with impurity. What doth it doe, but serues our full contents, Brings food, and for it takes our excrements, Yeelds vs all plenty, worthy of regard And dirt and mucke we giue it for reward? Riuers fabled or feigned to be in Hell. Oh what a world of Poets that excell In art, haue fabled riuers out of hell, As Erebus, Cocitus, Acheron, Stix, Orchus, Tartarus, and Phlegeton, And all infernall Barathrums Damn'd Creekes, With Charons Passengers, and fearefull shriekes, Who writing drinking Lethe to their shames Vnthankefully they haue forgot the Thames. But noble Thames, whilest I can hold a pen I will diuulge thy glory vnto men: Thou in the morning when my coine is scant Before the euening dost supply my want. If like a Bee I seeke to liue and thriue, Thou wilt yeeld hony freely to my hiue, If like a dronc I will not worke for meate, Thou in discretion giues me nought to eate Thou the true rules of Iustice dost obserue, To feed the lab'rer, let the idle sterue, And I so many faithlesse men haue found As any man that liues vpon the ground, Who haue done me wrong and themselues no good, And swore, and forswore in their damned mood: Whilst I (fond I) haue lent and giuen away To such as not so much as thankes will pay, For shame and modesty I name them not; But let their black soules beare the impure blot Of falshood periury, and odious lyes That diuels in shape of Mankind can deuise. If these lines happen to their hands to come, They'l pick their teeth, look downward and cry hum, But goodnesse how should euer I expect, From such who doe so true a friend neglect. And therefore Thames, with thee I haue decreed Because thoa neuer faild me in my need, To thee, to thee againe I doe retire And with thee Ile remaine till life expire, The Oare hath foure or fiue vertues; first, it is healthfull, second, it auoyds bad company, third, it keeps men sober, fourth, it gets mony, fift, it auoyds expences all which vertues I will put in practise and fall to rowing. Thou art my Mistresse, and oft times from thee Thy liberalitie hath flow'd to me, And for thou alwayes giuest me meanes to liue My selfe (most thankefully my selfe doe giue. Momus thou Sonne of Somnus, and of Nox, Take not my lines all for a Paradox: For most of them seeme true, and I doe rue That many of them I doe know too true. Sleepe Momus sleepe, in Murceas slothfull bed, Let Morpheus locke thy tongue within thy head: Or if thou needst wilt prate, prate to this end To giue commends to that thou canst not mend. 'Tis not a guilded Gull made vp with oathes, That sweares and dams himselfe into good cloathes, That weares his cloake beneath his skirts and wast Cause men may see how he is trust and brac'd: Such a fantasticke asse, I care not for, He flewts my lines, and I doe him abhor. My poore inuention no way is supply'd, With cutting large thongs from anothers hide: I haue not stolne a syllable or letter From any man, to make my booke seeme better. But similies, comparisons, each line, Indifferent, good or bad, they all are mine, Yet I confesse I haue read many a booke From whence I haue some obseruations tooke. Which I make vse of, as occasions touch, And any Poet (I thinke) will doe as much. I will not brag, to all men bee it knoshne (By learning) I haue nothing of mine owne, But had I tongues and languages, like many Sure I should filch and steale as much as any. But like an Artlesse Poet, I say still, I cm a Taylor, true against my will. Thus ending (like to Iasons Golden-fleece) This worke of Hempseed is my Master-peace. FINIS.

A Pamphlet (Reader,) from the Presse is hurld, That hath not many fellowes in the world: The manner's common, though the matter's shallow, And 'tis all true, which makes it want a fellow. [I come from Bohem, yet no newes I bring] I come from Bohem, yet no newes I bring, Of busines 'twixt the Keysar and the King: My Muse dares not ascend the lofty staires Of state, or write of Princes great affaires. And as for newes of battels, or of War, Were England from Bohemia thrice as far: Yet we doe know (or seeme to know) more heere Then was, is, or will be euer knowne there. At Ordinaries, and at Barbar-shops, There tidings vented are, as thicke as hops, How many thousands such a day were slaine, What men of note were in the battle ta'ne, When, where, and how the bloody fight begun, And how such sconces, and such Townes were won; How so and so the Armies brauely met, And which side glorious victorie did get: The moneth, the weeks, the day, the very houre, And time, they did oppose each others powre, These things in England, prating fooles doe chatter, When all Bohemia knowes of no such matter. For all this Summer that is gone and past, Untill the first day of October last, The armies neuer did together meet, Nor scarce their eye-fight did each other greet: The fault is neither in the foot or horse, Of the right valiant braue Bohemian force, From place to place they daily seeke the foe, They march, and remarch, watch, ward, ride, run, goe, And grieuing so to waste the time away, Thirst for the hazard of a glorious day. But still the Enemy doth playboe peepe, And thinkes it best in a whole skin to sleepe, For neither martiall policie, or might, Or any meanes can draw the foe to fight: And now and then they conquer, spoile and pillage, Some few thatcht houses, or some pelting Village; And to their trenches run away againe, Where they like Foxes in their holes remaine, Thinking by lingring out the warres in length, To weaken and decay the Beamish strength. This is the newes, which now I meane to booke, He that will needs haue more, must needs goe looke. Thus leauing warres, and matters of high state, To those that dare, and knowes how to relate, J'le onely write, how I past heere and there, And what I haue obserued euery where, I'le truely write what I haue heard and eyed, And those that will not so be satisfied, J (as I meet them) will some tales deuise, And fill their eares (by word of mouth) with lies: The Month that beares a mighty Emp'rors name, (Augustus hight) I passed downe the streame, Friday the fourth, just sixteene hundred twenty Full Moone, the signe in Pisces, that time went I; The next day being Saturday, a day, Which all Great Brittaine well remember may. When all with thankes doe annually combine, Vnto th'Almighty maiesty diuine, Because that day in a most happy season, Our Soueraigne was preseru'd from Gouries treason; Therefore to Churches people doe repaire, And offer sacrifice of praise and prayer, With Bels and bonfires, euery towne addressing. And to our gracious King their loues expressing, On that day, when in euery nooke and angle, Faggots and bauins smoak'd, and bels did jangle: Onely at Graues end, (why I cannot tell) There was no sparke of fire, or sound of bell, Their steeple, (like an instrument vnstrung,) Seem'd (as I wish all scolds) without a tongue, Their bonfires colder then the greatest frost, Or chiller then their charities (almost) Which I perceiuing, said, J much did muse, That Graues-end did forget the thankefull vse, Which all the townes in England did obserue; And cause I did the King of Britaine serue. J and my fellow, for our Masters sake, Would (neere the water side) a bonfire make; With that a Scotchman, Tompson by his name, Bestowed foure faggots to encrease the flame, At which to kindle all a Graues-end Baker, Bestowed his bauine, and was our partaker: We eighteene foote from any house retir'd, Where we a Iury of good Faggots fir'd; But e're the flame or scarce the smoake began, There came the fearefull shadow of a man, The Ghost or Jmage of a Constable, Whose franticke actions (downeright dunce-stable,) Arm'd out of France and Spaine with Bacchus bounty: (Of which there's plenty in the Kentish County) His addle coxcombe with tobacco puff'd His guts with ale full bumbasted and stuff'd, And though halfe blind, yet in a looking glasse, He could perceiue the figure of an Asse; And as his slauering chaps non sence did stutter, His breath (like to a jakes) a sent did vtter, His legs indenting scarcely could beare vp, His drunken trunke (o're charg'd with many a cup) This riffraff rubbish that could hardly stand, (Hauing a staffe of office in his hand,) Came to vs as our fire began to smother, Throwing some faggots one way some another, And in the Kings name did first breake the peace, Commanding that our bonfire should succease, The Scotchman angry at this rudenesse done, The scattered faggots he againe layd on: Which made the demy Constable goe to him, And punch him on the brest, and outrage doe him; At which a cuffe or twaine were giuen, or lent, About the eares, (which neither did content.) But then to he are how fearefull the asse braid, With what a hideous noyse he howld for ayde, That all the ale in Graues-end, in one houre, Turn'd either good, bad, strong, small, sweet, or foure: And then a kennell of incarnate currs, Hang'd on poore Thompson like so many burrs; Haling him vp the dirty streets, all foule, (Like Diuels pulling a condemned soule.) The Jaylor (like the grand deu'll) gladly sees. And with an itching hope of fines and fees, Thinking the Constable and his sweet selfe, Might drinke and quaffe with that ill gotten pelfe; For why such hounds as these, may if they will, Vnder the shew of good, turne good to ill, And with authority the peace first breake, With Lordly domineering o're the weake, Committing (oft) they care not whom or why, So they may exercise themselues thereby, And with the Iaylor share both fee and fine, Drowning their damned gaine in smoake and wine: Thus hirelings Constables, and Iaylors may, Abuse the Kings liege people night and day, I say they may, I say not they doe so, And they know best if they doe so or no, They hal'd poore Thompson all along the street, Tearing him that the ground scarce touch'd his feet, Which he perceiuing did request them cease Their rudenesse, vowing he would goe in peace, He would with quietnesse goe where they would, And prayed them from his throat to loose their hold. Some of the townesmen did intreat them there, That they their barbarous basenesse would forbeare, But all intreaty was like oyle to fire, Not quench'd; but more inflam'd the scuruy Squire. Then they afresh began to hale and teare, (Like mungrell Mastiffes on a little Beare,) Leauing kind Thompson neither foote or fist, Nor any limb or member to resist. Who being thus opprest with ods and might, Most valiant with his teeth, began to bite, Some by the fingers, others by the thumbs, He fang'd within the circuit of his gummes; Great pitty 't was his chaps did neuer close, On the halfe Constables, cheekes, eares, or nose; His seruice had deseru'd reward to haue, If he had mark'd the peasant for a Knaue: Yet all that labour had away beene throwne, Through towne and Country he's already knowne; His prisoner he did beat, and spurn'd and kick'd, He search'd his pockets, (Jle not say he pick'd) And finding as he said no mony there, To heare how then the Bellweather did sweare, And almost tearing Thompson into quarters, Bound both his hands behind him with his garters, And after in their rude robustious rage, Tide both his feet, and cast him in the Cage, There all night he remained in louzie litter, Which for the Constable had beene much fitter, Or for some vagabond (that's sprung from Caine,) Some Rogue or runnagate, should there haue laine, And not a Gentleman that's well descended, That did no hurt, nor any harme intended: But for a bonfire in fit, time and place, To bee abus'd and vs'd thus beastly base, There did J leaue him till the merrow day, And how he scap'd their hands J cannot say. This piece of Officer, this nasty patch, (Whose vnderstanding sleepes out many a Watch) Ran like a towne bull, roaring vp and downe, Saying that we had meant to fire the towne; And thus the Diuell his Master did deuise, To houlster out his late abuse with lyes, So all the street downe as I past along, The people all about me in a throng. Calling me villaine, traitor, rogue and thiefe, Saying that I to fire their towne was chiefe. I bore twe wrongs as patient as J might, Vowing my pen should ease me when J write; Like to a grumbling cur, that sleepes on hay, Eates none himselfe, driues other beasts away. So this same fellow would not once expresse, Vnto his Prince, a subiects ioyfulnesse, But cause we did attempt it (as you see) H'imarison'd Thompson, and thus slandered me. Thus hauing eas'd my much incensed muse, I craue the reader this one fault excuse, For hauing vrg'd his patience all this time, With such a scuruy Subiect, and worse rims; And thou Graues-endian officer take this, And thanke thy selfe, for all that written is, 'Tis not against the towne this tale I tell, (For sure there doth some honest people dwell,) But against thee thou Fiend in shape of man, By whom this beastly outrage first began, Which I could doe no lesse but let thee know, And pay thee truely what J long did owe, And now all's euen betwixt thou and I, Then farewell and be hang'd, that's twice God bwye. [This is a Tub of Tubs, Tub of Tubs hall] This is a Tub of Tubs, Tub of Tubs hall, Who ne're had fellow yet, nor euer shall; O had but Diogenes but had this a ton, He would had thought that he more roome had won, Then Alexanders Conquests, or the bounds, Of the vast Ocean and the solid grounds. Or had Cornelius but this tub, to drench His Clients that had practis'd too much French, A thousand hogsheads then would haunt his firkin, And Mistris Minks recouer her lost mirkin. This mighty Caske great Bacchus vs'd to stride, When he to drunkards hall did often ride. And in this barrell he did keepe his Court, Bathing himsefe in Rhenish for disport. But now these eight yeares it hath dry beene kept; In it the wine God hath not pist or wept; That now the Chappell, and the Caske combine, One hath no preaching, t'other hath no wine. And now the vse they put it to is this, 'Tis shew'd for mony, as the Chappell is. [There for a token I did thinke it meet] There for a token I did thinke it meet, To take the shooes from off this Prince his feet: I doe not say I stole, but I did take, And whil'st I liue, Ile keepe them for his sake: Long may his Grace liue to be styl'd a man, And then Ile steale his bootes too, if I can. The shooes were vpright shooes, and so was he That wore them, from all harme vpright and free: He vs'd them for their vse, and not for pride, He neuer wrong'd them, or e're trode aside. Lambskin they were, as white as Innocence, (True patternes for the footsteps of a Prince,) And time will come (as I doe hope in God) He that in childhood with these shooes was shod, Shall with his manly feet once trample downe, All Antichristian foes to his renowne. [Prague is a famous, ancient, Kingly seate] Prague is a famous, ancient, Kingly seate, In scituation and in state compleate, Rich in aboundance of the earths best treasure, Proud and high minded beyond bounds or measure, In Architecture stately; in Attire, Beizonians Plebeians doe aspire, To be apparell'd with the stately port Of Worship, Honour, or the Royall Court; Their Coaches, and Caroches are so rife, They doe attend on euery trades-mans wife, Whose Husbands are but in a meane regard, And get their liuing by the Ell or Yard, How euer their Estates may bee defended, Their wiues like demy Ladies are attended: I there a Chimney-sweepers wife haue seene, Habilimented like the Diamond Queene, Most gaudy garish, as a fine Maid-marrian, With breath as sweet as any suger carrion, With sattin cloak, lin'd through with budg or sable, Or cunny furre, (or what her purse is able) With veluet hood, with tiffanies, and purles, Rebatoos frizlings, and with powdred curles, And (lest her hue or sent should be attainted,) She's antidoted, well perfum'd and painted, She's fur'd she's fring'd, she's lac'd, and at her wast: She's with a massie chaine of siluer brac'd, She's yallow starch'd, and ruff'd, and cuff'd, and muff'd, She's ring'd, she's braceleted, she's richly tuff'd, Her petticote good silke as can be bought, Her smock about the tale lac'd round and wrought, Her gadding legges are finely Spanish booted, The whilst her husband liked a slaue all sooted, Lookes like a Courtier to infernall Pluto, And knowes himselfe to be a base cornuto. Then since a man that liues by Chimney sweepe, His wife so gaudy richly clad doth keepe, Thinke then but how a Merchants wife may goe, Or how a Burgamasters wife doth show; There by a kinde of topsie turuy vse,) The women weare the bootes, the men the shooes. I know not if't be profit or else pride, But sure th'are oft'ner ridden then they ride: These females seeme to be most valiant there, Their painting shewes they doe no colours feare. Most Art-like plastring Natures imperfections, With sublimated, white and red complexions; So much for Pride I haue obserued there, Their other faults, are almost euery where. [Sixe things vnto a Trauailer belongs] Sixe things vnto a Trauailer belongs, An Asses backe, t'abide and beare all wrongs: A fishes tongue (mute) grudging speech forbearing. A Harts quick eare, all dangers ouerhearing, A dogs eyes, that must wake as they doe sleepe, And by such watch his corpes from perill keepe. A swines sweet homely tast that must digest All Fish, Flesh, Rootes, Fowle, foule and beastly drest; And last, he must haue euer at his call A purse well lynde with coyne to pay for all. [You that haue bought this, grieue not at the cost] You that haue bought this, grieue not at the cost, There's something worth your noting, all's not lost, First halfe a Constable is well bumbasted, If there were nothing else, your coynes not wasted, Then I relate of hils, and dales, and downes, Of Churches, Chappels Pallaces, and Townes, And then to make amends (although but small) I tell a tale of a great tub withall, With many a Gallowes, Gybbet and a wheele, Where murd'rers bones are broke from head to heele How rich Bohemia, is in wealth and food, Of all things which for man or beast is good. How in the Court at Prague (a Princely place, A gracious Queene vouchsafed me to grace, How on the sixteenth day of August last, King Fredericke to his royall Army past, How fifty thousand were in armes araid, Of the Kings force, beside th'Hungarian ayde, And how Bohemia strongly can appose, And cuffe and curry all their daring foes. Then though no newes of state may heere be had, I know here's something will make good men glad, No bringer of strange tales I meane to be, Nor Ile beleeue none that are told to me. FINIS. PRINCE CHARLES HIS VVELCOME FROM SPAINE: VVho Landed at Portsmouth on Sunday the 5. of October, and came safely to London on Munday the 6. of the same, 1623. WITH The Triumphs of London for the same his happie Arriuall. And the Relation of such Townes as are scituate in the wayes to take post-horse at, from the Citie of London to Douer: and from Callice through all Frænce and Spaine, to Madrid, to the Spanish-Court. [The Bels proclaim'd aloud in euery Steeple] The Bels proclaim'd aloud in euery Steeple, The ioyfull acclamations of the people. The Ordnance thundred with so high a straine, As if great Mars they meant to entertaine. The Bonfires blazing, infinite almost, Gaue such a heat as if the world did roast. True mirth and gladnesse was in euery face, And healths ran brauely round in euery place: That sure I thinke this sixt day of October, Ten thousand men will goe to bed scarce (&amp;c.) This was a day all dedicate to Mirth, As 'twere our Royall Charles his second birth. And this day is a Iewell well return'd, For whom this Kingdome yesterday so mourn'd. God length his dayes who is the cause of this, And make vs thankfull for so great a blisse. [The Prince of Princes, and the King of Kings] The Prince of Princes, and the King of Kings, Whose Eye of Prouidence foresees all things, To whom what euer was, or ere shall be, Is present still before his Maiesty. Who doth dispose of all things as he list, And graspeth Time in his eternall fist; He sees and knowes (for vs) what's bad or good. And all things is by him well vnderstood, Mens weake coniectures no way can areed, What's in th'immortall Parlament decreed, And what the Trinitie concludeth there, We must expect it with obedience here. Then let not any man presume so farre, To search what the Almighties councels are, But let our wils attend vpon his will, And let his will be our direction still. Let not Pleibeans be inquisitiue, Or into any profound State-businesse diue. We in fiue hundred and nere sixty yeare, Since first the Norman did the Scepter beare, Haue many hopefull royall Princes had, Who as Heau'n pleas'd to blesse, were good or bad, Beauclarke was first (who was first Henry crown'd) For learning and for wisdome high renown'd) Beyond the verge of Christendomes swift Fame, Did make the world admire his noble name. The blacke Prince Edward, all his life time ran The race of an accomplisht Gentleman: His valour and tryumphant victories, Did fill the world and mount vnto the skyes. The warlike Henry of that name the fist, With his innated vertue vp did lift His name and fame to such perspicuous grace, Which time or no obliuion can deface, Prince Arthur whom our Chronicles record, To be a vertuous and a hopefull Lord: His budding fortunes were by death preuented, And as he liu'd belou'd, he dy'd lamented. His brother Henry from his fall did spring, First to be Prince of Wales, then Englands King He was magnificent and fortunate, According to the greatnesse of his state. Next Edward his vndoubted heyre by birth, Who (for the sins of men vpon the earth) God tooke him hence as he began to bloome, Whose worthy memory mens hearts intombe. Prince Henry last, a Prince of as great hope As ere was any yet beneath the Cope. He liu'd and dy'd bewailed and renown'd, And left this Land with teares of sorrow drown'd. Then onely this illustrious branch remain'd, Our gracious Charles, by Heauens high grace ordain'd, To be our Ioy, whose vertues (as I gather) Will length the life of his beloued Father. True loue and honour made his Highnesse please, Aduenturously to passe ore Lands and Seas. With hazard of his royall person and In that, the hope of all our happy Land. But blessed be his Name, whose great protection Preseru'd him still from change of ayres infection, That gaue him health and strength mongst sundry Nations, T'endure and like their dyets variations, That though to others these things might be strange, Yet did his Princely vigour neuer change, But with a strong and able constitution, He bore out all with manly resolution. Loue sometimes made the Gods themselues disguise, And muffle vp their mighty Dieties, And vertuous Princes of the Gods haue ods, When Princes goodnesse doe outgoe the Gods, Then foolish man this is no worke of thine, But operation of the power Diuine, Let God alone with what he hath in hand, 'Tis sawcy, folly, madnesse, to withstand What his eternall wisedome hath decreed, Who better knowes then we doe, what we need. To him lets pray for his most safe protection, Him we implore for his most sure direction: Let his assistance be Prince Charles his guide. That in the end God may be glorifide, Let vs amendment in our liues expresse, And let our thankes be more, our sins be lesse. Amongst the rest this is to bee remembred, that two Watermen at the Tower Wharfe burnt both their Boats in a Bonefire most merrily. FINIS. AN ENGLISH-MANS LOVE TO Bohemia. DEDICATED To the Honourable, well approued, and accomplisht Souldier, Sir Andrevv Gray Knight, Colonell of the Forces of Great Britaine, in this Noble Bohemian Preparation. Sir Andrevv Graie. Anagramma, I Garde In Warres. AN ENGLISHMANS LOVE TO Bohemia. With a friendly Farewell to all the noble Souldiers that goe from great Britaine to that honourable Expedition. The most part of the Kings, Princes, Dukes, Marquisses, Earles, Bishops, and other friendly Confederates, that are combined with the Bohemian part. Warres, noble warres, and manly braue designes. Where glorious valour in bright Armour shines: Where God with guards of Angels doth defend, And best of Christian Princes doe befriend, Where mighty Kings in glittering burnisht armes Lead bloudy brusing battels, and alarmes, Where honour, truth, loue royall reputation, Make Realmes and Nations ioyne in combination, Bohemia, Denmarke and Hungaria, The vpper and the lower Bauaria. The two great Countries of the Pallatine. The King of Sweden friendly doth combine, The Marquesse and Elector Brandenburge: The Dukes of Brunswicke and of Lunenburge. Of Holstein, Deuxpont, and of Wittemberge, Of the Low-Saxons, &amp; of Mackelberge, Braue Hessens Lansgraue Anholts worthy Prince of Tuscania. Prince. The inhance Townes whom force cannot conuince: Prince Mæurice, and the States of Netherlands, And th'ancient Knights of th'Empire lend their hands These and a number more then I haue nam'd, Whose worths and valours through the world are fam'd, With many a Marquesse, Byshop, Lord and Knight, T'oppose foule wrong, and to defend faire right: Whose warlike troopes assembled brauely are, To ayde a gracious Prince in a iust warre. Byshops of Halberstadt, Magenberg, Heshein, Osenburgh. The Marquesse of Auspash, Cullinbagh, Durlagh. The Count Palatine of Lowtrecke and Luxenburgh. The States of Venice and Sauoy. For God, for Natures, and for Nations Lawes, This martiall Army, vndertakes this cause; And true borne Britaines, worthy Countrymen, Resume your ancient honors once agen. I know your valiant minds are sharpe and keene To serue your Soueraignes daughter Bohems Queen. I know you need no spur to set you on, But you thinke dayes are yeares till you are gone, And being gone, you'l wealth and honour win, Whilst ryot here at home addes sin to sin, You (God assisting) may doe mighty things, Make Kings of Captiues, and of Captiues Kings, Riches and loue those that suruiue shall gaine, And Fame, and Heauen the portion of the slaine. The wounds and scars more beautifull will make Those that doe weare them for true honours sake. Since God then in his loue did preordaine That you should be his Champions, to maintaine His quarrell and his cause; a fig for foes, God being with you, how can man oppose? Some may obiect, Your enemies are store, If so, your fame and victori'es the more; Men doe win honour when they cope with men, The Eagle will not tryumph o're a Wren, The Lyon with the Mouse will not contend, Nor men 'gainst boyes and women wars will bend, But clouds of dust and smoake, and bloud and sweat, Are the maine meanes that will true honour get. Thus to Fames altitude must men aspire By noble actions won through sword and fire, By trumpets Clangor, drums, guns, flute or fife: For as there is an end to euery life, And man well knowes, that one day he must end it, Let him keep't well, defend, and brauely spend it. O griefe to see how many stout men lye Halfe rotten in their beds before they dye; Some by soule surfets, some by odious whoring. In misery lye stinking and deploring, And e're a lingring death their sad life ends, They are most tedious loathsome to their friends; Wasting in Physicke which addes woe to griefe That which should yeeld their families reliefe: At last when wished death their cares doe cure, Their names like to their bodies lye obscure. Whereas the Souldier with a Christian brest, Wars for his Soueraignes peace, and Countries rest: He to his Makers will, his will inclines, And ne're gainst Heauen impatiently repines, He to his Sauiour sayes that thou art mine, And being thou redeem'st me, I am thine, That if I liue or dye, or dye or liue, Blest be thy name whether thou take or giue, This resolution pierces heauens high roofe, And armes a Souldier more then Cannon proofe. Suppose his life ends by some noble wounds. His Soule to Heauen, from whence it came rebounds: Suppose blowne vp with powder vp he flyes, Fire his impurity repurifies, Suppose a shot pierce through his breast or head, He nobly liu'd, and nobly he is dead, He lyes not bedred stinking, nor doth raue Blaspheming against him that should him saue, Nor he in Physicke doth consume and spend That which himselfe and others should defend, He doth not languish drawing, loathsome breath, But dyes before his friends doe wish his death, And though his earthly part to earth doth passe, His fame outweares a Monument of brasse. Most worthy Country-men couragious hearts, Now is the time now act braue manly parts, Remember you are Sonnes vnto such Sires, Whose sacred memories the world admires, Make your names fearefull to your foes againe, Like Talbot to the French, or Drake to Spaine: Thinke on braue valiant Essex and Mountioy, And Sidney, that did Englands foes destroy, With noble Norris, Williams, and the Veeres, The Grayes, the Willouglebies, all peerelesse Peeres, And when you thinke what glory they haue won. Some worthy actions by you will be done, 34. Battels fought in France by Englishmen since the Conquest. Henry the sixth. Remember Poictiers, Cressy, Agincourt, With Bullein, Turwin, Turnyes warlike sport, And more (our honours higher to aduance) Our King of England was crown'd King of France. In Paris thus all France we did prouoake T'obey and serue vnder the English yoake. In Ireland 18. bloudy fields we fought, And that fierce Nation to subiection brought, Besides Tyrones rebellion which foule strife Cost England many a pound, lost many a life, And before we were Scotlands, or it ours. How often haue we with opposed powers In most vnneighbourly, vnfriendly manners, With hostile armes, displaying bloudy banners: With various victories on eyther side, Now vp, now downe, our fortunes haue beene tride. What one fight wins, the other loosing yeelds, In more then sixescore bloudie foughten fields. But since that we and they, and they and we More neere then brethren, now conioyned be, Those scattering powers we each gainst other lead, Being one knit body, to one royall head. Then let this Iland, East, West, South and North Ioyntly in these braue warres emblaze our worth And as there was a strife that once befell Twixt men of Iuda and of Jsrael: Contending which should loue King Dauid best. And who in him had greatest interest. Long may contention onely then be thus Twixt vsand Scotland, and twixt them and vs: Stil friendly striuing which of vs can be Most true and loyall to his Maiesty. This is a strife will please the God of peace, And this contending will our loues encrease. You hardy Scots remember royall Bruce, And what stout Wallace valour did produce: The glorious name of Stewards, Hamiltons, The Ereskins, Morayes, nd the Leuingstons, The noble Ramseyes, and th'illustrious Hayes, The valiant Dowglasses, the Grimes and Grayes, Great Sir James Dowglas, a most valiant Knight. Lead seauenty battels with victorious fight. Not by Lieutenants, or by deputation. But he in person wan his reputation. The Turkes and Sarazens he ouercame, Where ending life he purchast endlesse fame, And his true noble worth is well deriu'd, To worthies of that name that since suruiu'd, The praise of Sir Iames Dowglas, in the Raigne of King Robert Bruce, 1330. In 13, maine battels he ouercame Gods enemies, and at last was slaine. Then since both Nations did and doe abound With men approu'd and through all lands renown'd, Through Europe and through Asia, further farte, Then is our blest Redeemers Sepulchre. Through all the Coasts of tawny Affrica, And through the bounds of rich America, And as the world our worths acknowledge must, Let not our valour sleeping lye and rust; But to immortalize our Britaines name, Let it from imbers burst into a flame. We haue that Land and shape our Elders had, Their courages were good, can ours be bad? Their deeds did manifest their worthy mindes, Then how can we degenerate from kindes? In former times we were so giuen to warre, Witnesse the broyles ('twixt Yorke and Lancaster) Hauing no place to forreigne Foes to goe, Amongst our selues, we made our selues a Foe Full threescore yeares with fierce vnkind alarmes, Were practis'd fierce vnciuill ciuill armes, Whilst fourescore Peeres of the bloud royall dyde, With hundred thousands Commoners beside. Thus Englishmen to wars did beare good will, They would be doing, although doing ill. And Scotlands Hystorie auoucheth cleare, Of many ciuill warres and turmoyles there, Rebellion, discord, rapine and foule spoyle, Hath pierc'd the bowels of their Natiue soyle, Themselues against themselues, Peeres against Peeres, And kin with kin together by the eares, The friend gainst friend, each other hath withstood, Vnfriendly friends weltering in their bloud, Thus we with them, and they with vs contending, And we our selues, and they themselues thus rending, Doth shew that all of vs hath euer bin Addicted vnto martiall discipline: Spaine can report, and Portingale can tell, Denmarke and Norway, both can witnesse well, Sweden and Poland, truely can declare Our Seruice there, and almost euery where. And Belgia but for the English and the Scots, Perpetuall slauery had beene their lots Vnder the great commanding power of Spaine, By th'Prince of Parma's and the Archdukes traine. The Low Countries, Holland, Zealand, &amp;c, Farre for my witnesses I need looke, 'Tis writ in many a hundred liuing booke. And Newports famous battell brauely tels, The English and the Scots in fight excels: Yea all, or most Townes in those seuenteene Lands Haue felt the force, or friendship of their hands. Ostend whose siege all other did surpasse That will be, is, or I thinke euer was, In three yeares three moneths, Scots &amp; Englishmen Did more then Troy accomplished in ten. Ostend endur'd (which ne're will be forgot) Aboue seuen hundred thousand Canon shot: And, as if Hell against it did conspire, They did abide death, dearth, and sword and fire, There danger was with resolution mixt, And honour with true valour firmely fixt. Were death more horrid then a Gorgons head, In his worst shapes they met him free from dread. There many a Britaine dy'de, and yet they liue, In fame, which fame to vs doth courage giue. At last, when to an end the siege was come, The gainers of it cast their loosing summe, And the vneuen reckoning thus did runne: The winners had most losse, the loosers wonne: For in this siege vpon the Archdukes side Seauen Masters of the Campe all wounded dyde. And fifteene Colonels in that warre deceast. And Serieant Majors twenty nine, at least. Captaines fiue hundred sixty fiue were slaine. Leiutenants (whilst this Leaguer did remaine) One thousand, and one hundred and sixteene Dyed and are now as they had neuer beene. Ensignes three hundred twenty two, all euen: And nineteen hundred Serieants and eleuen. Corp'rals and Lantzprizadoes death did mixe In number seauenteene hundred sixty sixe. Of Souldiers, Mariners, women, children, all, More then seauen times ten thousand there did fall. Thus Ostend was at deare rates wonne and lost, Besides these liues, with many millions cost. And when 'twas won, 'twas won but on conditions, On honourable tearmes, and compositions: The winners wan a ruin'd heape of stones, A demy-Golgotha of dead mens bones. Thus the braue Britaines that the same did leaue, Left nothing in it worthy to receiue. And thus from time to time, from age to age, To these late dayes of our last Pilgrimage, We haue beene men with martiall mindes inspir'd. And for our meeds, belou'd, approu'd, admir'd. Men prize not Manhood at so low a rate To make it idle, and effeminate: And worthy Countrymen I hope and trust You'l doe as much as your fore-fathers durst. A faire aduantage now is offered here Whereby your wonted worths may well appeare, And he that in this quarrell will not strike, Let him expect neuer to haue the like. He that spares both his person and his purse, Must (if euer he vse it) vse it worse. And you that for that purpose goe from hence To serue that mighty Princesse, and that Prince, Ten thousand, thousand prayers shall euery day Implore th'Almighty to direct your way. Goe on, goe on, braue Souldiers neuer cease Till noble Warre, produce a noble Peace. FINIS. [The peace of France, with the praise of Archy. Honour Conceal'd; Strangely Reveal'd: OR, The worthy Praise of the Vnknowne Merits of the Renowmed Archibald Armestrong, who for his vnexpected Peace-making in France, betwixt the King and the Rochellers, hath this Poem Dedicæted as a Trophee, to his matchlesse Vertues. This being done in the yeare of our Lord, 1623. Written by him whose Name Annagramatiz'd, is Loyol In Hart. 'Tis not the Warres of late I write vpon In France, at the Iles of Rhea or Olleron: These things were written in K. Iames his Raigne, Then Read it not with a mistaking Braine. THE PEACE OF FRANCE, With the Praise of Archy. Vlisses was a happy man of men, In that his acts were writ with Homers pen, And Uirgil writ the Actions &amp; the Glory, Of bold and braue Æneas wand'ring story. Great Alexander had the like successe, Whose life wise Quintus Curtius did expresse, And (worthy Archy) so it fares with thee To haue thy name and fame emblaz'd by me. For Homer was the Prince of Poets styl'd, And Princely actions onely he compyl'd. And Quintus Curtius, with ornated skill, Did soare aloft with his Hystorian Quill. But pardon mee, much short of their great worth If in a lower straine I set thee forth. And sure I hold it for no little Grace That 'tis my lot thy honour to vncase, Nor can it be impeachment to thy name To haue so meane a pen divulge thy fame. For when the businesse is in order knit, The subiect for the writer will seeme fit. First, I haue read in Prophesies of old, That written were by Merlin, who foretold Some strange predictions, that without all doubt Doth Cull, or picke, or point, or marke thee out. The Prophesie, as thus. When as the sect of Mahomet Themselu's against themselues shall set: When as the Gauls the Gauls shall spur and Gall, When Castles, Townes and Towers shall fall, When nought but Horror, Death and Dread, Shall famous fertile France or'e spread, Then shall a man depart our strands, Borne 'twixt the Rumps of two great Lands, And he shall make these brawles to cease And set all France in friendly peace. His name shall Strong in Arme be call'd, With Chiefe (though Bearded) joyn'd with Bald. This Prophesie is charity kept by one Nimpshag a Scottish witch who dwels in a Caue in Rane one of the Iles of the Hebrides. About nine hundred yeares, or somewhat nigh, Are past, since Merlin spoke this Prophecie, And all the world may see, that what he sed In Archies person is accomplished. First all the Turkes that Mahomet adore Are by the eares, and welter in their Gore. Next France, which Gaul in time of yore was nam'd; With war hath wasted beene, with fire inflam'd. Then thirdly, Armestrong thither was conuaid And then, and not till then the peace was made. We fourthly finde (to further our auailes) How he was borne betweene the Rumps, or tailes Of two great Kingdomes, which were call'd the borders, Now midst of Britæine, free from old disorders. And lastly Strong in Arme his name shalbe, Chiefe, Arch, or Bald or bold, which all agree. There is a fellow, with a crafty pate That made a cunaing Anagram of late, The words were Merry Rascall, to be hang'd, But if the writer in my hands were fang'd, I quickly would inforce him know that he Should meddle with his fellowes not with me. But vnto thee, from whom I haue digrest Braue Archybald, I find it manifest The name of Armestrong, like strong men of armes, Haue euer valiantly outdar'd all harmes. And for their stout atchieuments bin accounted, To be regarded, waited on and mounted. Whilst those, whose merits could not win such state Were grieued at their heart to see their fate. And mayest thou rise. within this age of ours, Vnto the honour of thy ancestours. That the Auxungia of thy Matchlesse brest May breed fresh Mandrakes to cause sleepe and rest, To charme the Temples of consuming warres. As thou hast done amongst the Rochellers. 'Twas sharpe contention that began those broyles Which fild all France with fell domesticke spoyles, And that discention did so farre offend That wisedome scarcely could the mischiefe end, And therfore 'twas ordain'd that thou shouldst come To hang the Colours vp, and still the Drum To cease the trumpets clang, and fifes shrill squeaking And bring forth frightfull peace that close, lay sneaking Not daring once her visage out to thrust Till Armours were committed vnto rust; Oh thou who art halfe English and halfe Scot I would not haue thee proud of this thy lot, But yet I should be proud if't were my chance To doe as thou sayest thou hast done in France. But should thy worth and acts bee here denyde Thou hast ten thousand witnesses beside. Who will maintaine 'gainst eyther friend or foe, If thou didst make the peace in France or no. 'Tis certaine that thou soundst them all vnruly Within the Month of August, or of Iuly: And in September, or I thinke October Thou lefst them all in peace, some drunke, some sober; Then what is he that dares expostulate, Or any way thy fame extenuate, But he whose Idlenesse will make it knowne, That he hath little businesse of his owne. Nor can he be of any Ranke or note That enuies thee, or any of thy Coate: Then let desert fall where desert is due Thine honour is thine owne, and fresh and new. War could not end the war, twas plainely seene Wealth could not stop the floudgates of their spleene, Strength could not make them lay their weapons by Wit could not helpe, nor martiall policy, Perswasion did not doe that good it would, And valour would decide it, if it could. When neither of these vertues are in price Then thou didst boldly shew them, what a Vice It was for Subiects to prouoke their King, By their Rebellion their owne deaths to bring. When many a Mounsieur of the gallant Gaules, Vnnat'rally was slaine in ciuill braules, When many a Mother childlesse there was made And Sire 'gainst Son oppos'd with trenchant blade, When Roaring Cannons counterchekt the thunder, And stately buildings lay their Ruines vnder. When smoake eclipsing Sol, made skyes looke dim, And murd'ring bullets seuer'd lim from lim; Then didst thou come, and happy was thy comming For then they left their Gunning and their Drumming. And let the world of thee say what it list, God will blesse him that made the warre desist. 'Tis wondrous strange, fate cannot be withstood No man did dreamt thou euer wouldst doe good: And yet to see beyond all expectation All France and Britaine Ring with acclamation And with applawsefull thankes they doe reioyce That great Nauarre, and Burbon, and Valoyes, Guize, Loraine, Balleine, all the Gallian Peeres. Like fixed starres, are setled in their spheares. A foole can raise a flame from out a sparke, But he's a man of speciall note and marke And worthy to be guerdon'd for his paine That turnes a flame into a sparke againe; So hast thou done, or else there are some Lyers Thou didst extinguish wars combustious fires, And what thou didst, I see no reason but, In print the Memorandums should be put. Thou hast a brace of Brothers trauailers, Who each of them in their particulers Shewes of what house they came, and of all others, They'l do things worthy to be knowne thy brothers. The one to Poland, or the Land of Po To vnexpected purpose late did goe. The other furnish'd with as braue a mind Vnto Virginia wandered with the winde. Where like a second Rephabus, braue Kitty Doth make those parts admire him, he's so witty; And though but little seruice he did here 'Tis past mans knowledge what he may doe there. And where they are, they striue still to appeare, To doe as much good there, as thou doest neere. I wish you all were married, that your seed Like Sonnes of Caine might multiply and breed: For 'tis great pitty, such a stocke, or race Obliuion should consume, or time deface. Hadst thou but liu'd amongst the hairebraind elfs, In Italy the Gibelines and the Guelphs: Thou with thy oylely Oratory words Hadst made them (at their owne wils sheath their swords: Or when Augustus, Pompey, Anthony, Sought Monarchy in Warres Triumuiri, Hadst thou beene neere them er'e their mortall fight Thou hadst done more then I can truely write. Or had Jerusalem but had thy mate Before Uespation it did Ruinate, The Mad men Eleazar, Simon, Iohn, Had neuer wrought their owne destruction. And happy had it beene, if thou hadst bin When Yorke and Lancaster did loose and win Thou hadst done more then any man can tell Those mighty factions to suppresse and quell. There's a late Currant stuff'd with tales and newes Of the Hungarians Sarazens, and Jewes, And to the Turkish Citty (Hight) it come Constantinople, or Bizantum, In which Caranta all the French designes, With Archies name endors'd did grace the lines, And how thou wast the Pipe or Instrument That made the peace there to their great content. And scanning of the businesse thus and thus They did admire thee there as much as vs. For they are there like rough tempestuous Seas, All by the cares, whom no man can appease. At last amongst themselues they did agree, To send a great Ambassador for thee, The great Grandsigneor, the Commission sign'd And they abide to haue Moone, Sun and Wind, The name of him that brings the Embassy. Is Halye Bashaw, Lord of Tripoly. He is attended and well waited on, By Sinan Beglerbeg of Babylon. The Sanzake of Damascus comes along And many more, a mighty troope and throng. And sure twill be much honour vnto thee To cause these Mad Mahometans agree. Thou shalt be fed with dainties and with suckets And thy reward shall be Chickens and Duckets. The Turkes are at eiull Warres, and entend to send an Ambassador for Archy, to doe as much for them as he did for France. He fet sayle for this place the 32. of Nouember last. The Tartar Chrim, Icleaped Tamor Can, Warres with the mighty great Moscouian And vnto them haue thy exploytes bin told, But goe not there, the Climates are to cold. Our Merchants might doe well to hire thee hence 'Gainst Tunis and Argiere, for their defence, There in the Straites, or in the Gulph of Venice, (Where Neptune tosseth Ships, like Bals at tennis) Thou mayest amongst the Pyrates take some course, To mitigate or aggrauate their force. I muse what Planet had within the sky, Predominance at thy Natiuity, For surely Fortune wrapt thee in her smooke, And like a Lamb, did in the Cradle Rocke: She dandled thee and luld thee in her lap And tenderly she gaue thee sucke and pap; Her purblinde fancie to her more delights Esteem'd thee 'mongst her chiefest fauourites; Much happy was it, that she daign'd to smile On vs, that thou hadst birth within our Ile, For thou at Jericho mightst haue been borne, Then all our hopes in thee had beene forlorne, Or at Cathay in China, or Iapan, And who can tell what we should all doe than, And sure did Presier Iohn and the Mogull But knew thy worth and vertue to the full Nor Britaines Bounds thy Carkasse then could hold If thou for Gold or Siluer mightst be sold. Or 'tis a question they would make pretence 'Tinuade our Land, by force to take thee hence. For why in thee a Iewell we enioy, As Whilome the Palladium was to Troy: Or like the Target, drop'd from Heauen to Rome So on thy person waites a fatall doome; In Terra call'd Jncognita did they That there inhabite, know but any way To compasse thee, they'ld hazard bloud and bone And passe the Frigido and the Torid Zone, The trope of Cancer and of Capricorne, To hold them from the hazard they would scorne And they would cut the Equinoctiall line 'Tenioy (as we doe) that sweet corps of thine. Wer't thou with Powhaton, he would agree To leaue the Diuell, and fall to worship thee, And (like that Image) giue thee honour there Nabuchadnezzar did in Babel reare. But whether doth my Muse thus Rambling run, 'Tis knowne the Warres in France are past &amp; done. And if themselues they to remembrance call, For what thou didst, they ought to thank thee all, Mars, and Bellona from thy presence fled, And Bacchus with faire Venus came in stead, The Codpicce God (Priapus) is erected In France, and Somnus is by Pax protected, Thou hast bereau'd the Souldiers of some knocks, And wounds and slashes are transform'd to pocks, For Citherea's the Chyrurgians Star And makes more worke in peace then Mærs in was. The Generals and Masters of the Campe The Colonels now cease to sweare and stempe, The Captaines haue layd by their bastinadoes, Lieutenants put to silence their brauadoes. The Colours furdled vp, the Drum is mute, The Seriants Ranks and Files doth not dispute, The Corp'rall knowes no watchword, Lantzprezadoes. Nor Souldiers scowt or lye in ambuscadoes, Now murdring Bullets, mortall Cuts and stabs, Are metamorphos'd to Dice, Drinke, and Drabs, To Fidlers, Pipers, Panders, Parasites, Fooles, Knaues and Festers, and such rare delights; The Cups run round, the tongue walks quicke and glid Whilst euery Tinker doth enioy his Tyb. Thrice happy France, that in thee did arriue Our strong arm'd Archy, that war thence did driue. And happier Britaine, now thy worth is knowne In hauing such a Iewell of thine owne. A Iewell pollish'd, and most brightly, burnish'd, Foyld, and well painted, set in Gold, Rich furnish'd; But all men knowes a Iewell shewes not well, Except it be dependant like a Bell, But Archy let delay breed no distaste, Theres time enough for all things, hast makes waste. There was a Post came late all tyr'd and weary. From Callice o're the Sea to Canterbury: And he reported that in euery angle, Of France, did bonfires burne, and Bels did Iangle; In euery market Towne, and Street and Citty, The Ballad-makers haue compos'd a Ditty To magnifie thy name which is resounded, And wondred at as farre as France is bounded, That in their drinking Schooles and tipling Houses, The Fidlers sing thy honor, for two souses. The whilst thy health runs round with wondrous quicknes, 'Till too much Health or health at last brings sicknes. And shall a forreine Land thus farre expresse To thee (for thy deserts) their thankefulnesse, And shall thy health in Britaine not be guzled And all our Muses be hide-bound and muzled. Great Ioue forbid, that such indignity Should ere befall to thy malignity. For since the Graces heere doe not befriend thee And since the Vertues will no way attend thee, The Sences seeme as sencelesse vnto thee The Sciences to thee Regardlesse be, The Gods and Goddesses seeme dumb and stupid (Except the Punke of Daphos, and young Cupid) Onely the deadly Sins, the Fates, and Feinds, On thee (as on ten thousand more) attends, I noted this, and grieued much in mind, That in our loues we were so farre behind; I was resolu'd to vndergoe this Chance, To write thy praise, as some haue done in France; And now I enterd am, I'le further in And spur my Muse amaine through thicke and thin, “Till I haue made the Court thy praises ring, “Till in thy lawd the Citty Songs do sing. Till I haue forc'd the Country Rurall Swaines Chant, Pipe, and dance thy praises on the Plaines, The tongues confusion in our braue Exchange Shall Babell like declare thy story strange, The newes of thee shall fill the Barbers shops, And at the Bake-houses, as thicke as hops The tatling women as they mold their bread Shall with their dough thy fourefold praises knead. Whilst Water-bearers at the Conduits all Within their tankerds sound thy honour shall, And at the house of office at Queene hithe, Men shall record thy actions braue and blithe. Then France shall well perceiue, who'ere sayes nay. That we haue bauins here as well as they, And that we can make bonefires, and ring bels, Drink healths, and be starke drunke, and something else, That we can rime beyond all sence or Reason And can doe what we may at any season, This shall be done before that I haue done And then thy glory shall a gallop run, Like to the gliding of a shooting Starre, East, West, South, North, from Deuer to Dunbar, Meane space accept the rudenesse of my Rime. And Ile doe twice as much another time. Thus wishing to Escape occasions Male, In Courtly Complement, my pen bids Uale. FINIS. HEAVENS BLESSING, AND EARTHS IOY. Or, A true relation, of the supposed sea-fights and Fire-workes, as were accomplished, before the Royall Celebration of the all-beloued Marriage, of the two peerelesse Paragons of Christendome, Fredericke and Elizabeth. With Triumphall Encomiasticke Verses, consecrated to the Immortall memory of those happie and blessed Nuptials. DEDICATED To the illustrous Lampe of true Worth, the noble, Ingenious, judicious, and vnderstanding Gentleman, Sir Iames Mvray Knight. Vnto the prospect of your Wisedomes eyes, I Consecrate these Epithalamies. Not that I thinke them worthy of your view, But for in Loue my thoughts are bound to you: I doe confesse my selfe vnworthy farre To write, in such high causes as these are, Which, Homer, Virgil, nor the fluent Tully, In fitting tearmes could scarce expresse them fully: But since the Muses did their bounties show, And on me did poore Poësie bestow; I hold it best to play the thankefull man, To spend their guifts the best wayes that I can, And not like pedling Bastards of the Muses, That like to Lawyers, liue on Times abuses. Thus vnto you I giue it as it is, Desiring pardon where there's ought amisse. Your Worships, Euer to be commanded in all integritie: Iohn Taylor. [Triumphall Verses.] EPITHALAMIES. Or, Encomiasticke Triumphall Verses, Consecrated to the Immortall memory, of the royall Nuptials of the two Parragons of Christendome Fredericke and Elizabeth. Hee God. that vpon the Poles hath hing'd the skyes Who made the Spheares, the Orbs, and Planets seuen. Whose justice dams, whose mercy justifies, What was, is, shall be, in earth, Hell, or Heauen: Whom men and Angels lauds and magnifies, (According as his Lawes command hath giuen) The poore, the Rich, the Begger and the King. In seuerall Anthems his great praises sing. Then as the meanest doe their voices stretch, To lawd the sempiternall Lord of Lords: So I a lame Decrepit-witted wretch, With such poore Phrases as my skill affoords: From out the Circuit of my braine did fetch, Such weake inuention as my wit records. To write the tryumphs of this famous Ile, On which both Heauen &amp; earth with ioy doth smile. My Genius therefore my inuention moues, To sing of Britaines great Olympick Games, Of mirth, of Heau'n and earths beloued loues, Of Princely sports, that noble mindes enflames To doe the vtmost of their best behoues; To fill the world with their atchieued Fames. T'attaine Eternities all-passing bounds, Which neither Fate, nor Death, nor Time confounds. Guns, Drums, and Trumpets, Fire-workes, Bonfires, Bels, With acclamations, and applausefull noyse: Tilts, Turneyes, Barriers, all in mirth excels, The ayre reuerberates our earthly ioyes. This great Tryumphing, Prophet-like fore-tels (I hope) how The Lake or Gulph of forgetfulnes of the which I hope our griefes haue sufficiently carowsed. Leathes Lake all griefe destroyes, For now blacke sorrow from our Land is chac'd, And ioy and mirth each other haue embrac'd. How much Iehouah hath this Iland blest, The thoughts of man can neuer well conceaue: How much we lately were with woes oprest. For him Prince Henry. whom Death did late of life bereaue. And in the midst of griefe, and sad vnrest, To mirthfull sport God. freely giu'es vs leaue: And when we all were drench'd in blacke dispaire. Ioy conquered greife, and comfort vanquish'd care. Thou high and mighty Fredericke the Fift, Count Pallatine and Palsgraue of the Rhine: Bauares great Duke, whom God on high doth lift. To be the tenth vnto the Worthies nine. Be euer blest with thy beloued The Princesse Elizabeth. Guift, Whom God, and best of men makes onely thine: Let annually the day be giuen to mirth, Wherein the Nuptials gaue our Ioyes new birth. Right gracious Princesse, great Elizabeth In whose Heroicke, pure, white Iuory breast, True vertue liues, and liuing flourisheth: And as their Mansion hath the same possest: Belou'd of God aboue, and men beneath, In whom the Goddesses and graces rest. By vertues power, Iehouah thee hath giuen, Each place doth seeme (where thou remein'st) a heauen. The Royall bloud of Emperours and Kings, Of Potent Conquerours, and Famous Knights Successiuely from these two Princes springs: Who well may claime these titles as their rights: The Patrons Christendome to vnion brings, Whose vnity remoted Lands vnites, And well in time (I hope) this sacred worke, Will hunt from Christian Lands the faithlesse Turke. By this happy martiage, great Britaine, France, Denmarke, Germny, &amp; the most part of Christendome are vnited eyther in affinty or consanguinity. Since first the framing of the worlds vast Roome, A fitter, better match was not combinde; So old in wisdome, young in beauties bloome, And both so good and graciously inclinde. And from this day, vntill the day of doome; I doubt succceding ages shall not finde; Such wisdome, beauty, grace, compact to gther, As is innate in them, in both in eyther. None (but the Diuell and his infernall crue) At this beloued heau'nly match repines, None (but such fiends, which hell on earth doth spue) Which wish Eclips of their illustrious shines, The Gods themselues with rare inuentions new, With inspiration mans deuice refines; And with their presence vndertakes these taskes, Deuises, motions, Reuels, playes, and Maskes. That which God loues most, the Diuell hates most: and I am sure that none but the blacke crew are offended with these Royal Nuptials. Tha thund'rers Iuno. Bride hath left her heauenly bed, And with her presence this great wedding graces; Himen in Saffron Robes inuelloped: Ioynes and accords these Louers lou'd embraces: Yea all the Gods downe to the Earth are fled, And mongst our ioyes their pleasures enterlaces. Immortals joynes with mortals in their mirth, And makes the Court their Paradice on earth. Maiestick Joue hath lost his spangled Throane To dance Leuoltoes at this Bridall feast: Infusing Iouiall glee in euery one, The high, the low, the greatest and the least. Sad mindes to sable melancholy prone, Great Ioue their vitall parts hath so possest: That all are wrapt in sportfull extasies, With showts and Clamors ecchoing in the skyes. Where the Planet Jupiter hath sole predominance, there is all Royall mirth, and jouiall alacrity. Sol. Apollo from the two topt Pernassus. Muses Hill Eight of the The Muses. Sisters nine hath brought from thence (Leauing A tragicall mourneful Muse who hath beene here already, but I hope now she is lame of the Gout, that she will keepe home for euer. Melpomene alone there still To muse on sad and tragicall euents) The rest all stretching their all matchlesse skill To serue this Royall Princesse, and this Prince. Thus Sol descended from his Radient shrine, Brings Poesie and Musicke downe diuine. The wrathfull God of Mars. War in burnish'd Armes Layes by his angry all confounding mood: And in the Lists strikes vp sweet Loues Alarmes, Where friendly warres drawes no vnfriendly bloud, Where honours fire the noble spirit warmes To vndertake such actions at are good. Thus mighty Mars these tryumphs doth encrease At Tilt. With peacefull warre, and sweet contentions peace. The Queene of Venus Loue these Royall sports attend, And at this Banquet deignes to be a guest: Her whole endeauours she doth wholly bend, She may in Loues delights outstrip the best: For whosoe're doth Hymens Lawes pretend If Uenus be but absent from the feast, They may perhaps be merry in some sort, But 'tis but painted mirth and ayrie sport. All worth nothing, Bright Mæias Sonne the God of tricks and sleights, Hath op'd the treasure of his subtill wit: Mercury. And as a Seruant on this Wedding waits With Masques, with Reuels, and with tryumphs fit, His rare inuentions and his quaint conceits, (Twixt Heauen aloft, and Hels infernall pit) He in imaginary showes affords In shape, forme, method, and applausefull words. Old sullen A dogged melancholy Planet, a maleuolent opposite to all mirth. Saturne hid his moody head, In dusky shades, of blacke Cimerian night: And wauering The Moone who doth neuer continue at a stay, and therefore she absented her selfe from those delights which I hope will bee permanent. Luna closely couch'd to bed, Her various change she knew would not delight The loyall mindes where constancie is bred, Where Proteus thoughts are put to shamefull flight. These two Saturne and Luna or indeed the nights, were darke at the Wedding because the moone shined not. by Joues command were straightly bound To stay at home (as better lost then found) Cupid descended from the Chrystall skyes And leaues behind his golden feathered darts: In steed of whom, he makes faire Ladies eyes The piercing weapons of true louing hearts. And he amongst these high Solemnities, His awfull presence freely he imparts, To all in generall with mirthfull cheere, All sport's the better if loues God be there. The off-spring of the high celestiall Ioue, His braine-bred Minerua whom the Poets faine to bee the Goddesse of Wisedome, Borne and bred in the braine ofIupiter. Daughter, and his thigh-borne Sonne Bacchus whom his Father Ioue saued from Abortiue birth from his mother Semel, and sowed him vp in his Thigh till the time of his birth was come to a period. Ouid Lib. 3.One with aduice of wisdome she wed her loue, And t'other bounteously made plenty runne: Where wine in streames gainst one another stroue, Where many a Caske was banckrout and vndone, Depriu'd the treasure of the fruitfull vines: By Bacchus bounty, that great God of Wines. Thus Ioue and Iuno, Jmps of aged Ops With wise Minerua, Mars and Mercury: Resplendent Sol with musicks straines and stops Faire Venus Queene of Loues alacrity, Loues God with shafts betipt with golden tops And Bacchus showring sweet humidity. Gods, Goddesses, the Graces and the Muses. To grace these tryumphs all their cunnings vses.

Thus like a Scribe, Fame waited to Record The Nuptialls of this Lady and this Lord, All making-marring time that turneth neuer To these proceedings still hath beene auspicious, And in his Progresse will I hope, perseuer, To make their dayes and houres to be delicious.

In thee alone let all their beings be: Let all the measures of their famous tracts, In thee begin, but neuer end like thee. And when thy Seruant Time, giues Life to Death, And Death surrenders all their liues to Fame: Oh then inspire them with celestiall breath, With Saints and Martyrs to applaud thy name.

About three hundred and twenty yeares since, or thereabout, (I thinke in the Raigne of King Richard the Second) there was a guift giuen to the Tower, or to the Lieutenants thereof, for the time then and for euer beeing, which guift was two blacke Leather Bottles, or Bombards of Wine, from euery Ship that brought Wine into the Riuer of Thames; the which hath so continued vntill this day, but the Merchants finding themselues agreeued lately, because they thought the Bottles were made bigger then they were formerly wont to bee, did wage Law with the Lieutenant (Sir Geruis Helwis by Name) in which sute the Lieutenant had beene ouerthrowne, but for such witnesses as I found that knew his right for a long time in their owne knowledge. But I hauing had the gathering of these Wines for many yeares, was at last Discharged from my place because I would not buy it, which because it was neuer bought or sold before, I would not or durst not venture vpon so vnhonest a Nouelty, it beeing sold indeed at so high a Rate, that who so bought it must pay thrice the value of it: wherevpon I tooke occasion to take leaue of the Bottles in this following Poem, in which the Reader must bee very melancholy, if the reading heereof doth not make him very merry. Iohn Taylor. By your leaue Gentlemen, Ile make some sport, Although I venture halfe a hanging for't: But yet I will no peace or manners breake For I to none but Leather-bottles speake. No anger spurres me forward, or despight Insomuch plaine Verse I talke of wrong and Right. The looser may speake, when the Winner wins, And madly merrily my Muse begins. Mad Bedlam Tom, assist me in thy Rags, Lend me thy Army of foule Feinds and Hags: Hobgoblins, Elues, faire Fayries, and foule Furies, Let me haue twelue Groce of Infernall Iuries, With Robin-Goodfellow and bloudie Bone Assist my merry Muse, all, euery one. I will not call to the The 9. Musc. Pegassian Nine, In this they shall not ayde me in a Line: Their fauours I'le reserue till fitter time, To grace some better businesse with my Rime, Plaine home-spun stuffe shall now proceed from me, Much like vnto the picture of we The picture of two Fooles, and the third looking on, I doe fitly compare with the two blacke Bottles and my selfe. Three. And now I talke of three, just three we are, Two false blacke bottles, and my selfe at jarre, And Reader when you reade our cause of strife, You'le laugh or else lye downe, I'le lay my life, But as remembrance lamely can rehearse, In sport Ile rip the matter vp in Verse. Yet first I thinke it fit here downe to set By what meanes first, I with those Bottles met. Then stroake your beard my Maisters and giue eare, I was a Waterman twice Foure long yeare, And liu'd in a Contented happy state, Then turn'd the whirling wheele of fickle Fate, From Water vnto Wind: Sir William Waad Did freely, and for nothing turne my trade. Ten yeares almost the place I did Retaine, And I filled the two Bottles, being in quantity sixe gallons, from euery ship that brought Wines vp the Riuer of Thames. glean'd great Bacchus bloud from France and Spaine, Few Ships my visitation did escape, That brought the sprightfull liquor of the Grape: My Bottles and my selfe did oft agree, Full to the top all merry came We three. Yet alwayes 'twas my chance in Bacchus spight, To come into the Tower vnfox'd vpright. But as mens thoughts a world of wayes doe range, So as Lieutenants chang'd, did customes The Wines had beene continually brought into the Lieutenants Seller of the Tower for 316. yeares, and neuer sold till now of late within this foure or fiue yeares. change: The Ancient vse, vs'd many yeares before, Was sold, vnto the highest Rate and more, At such a price, that whosoe're did giue, Must play the Thiefe, or could not saue and liue. Which to my losse, I manifestly found I am well sure it cost me thirty pound For one yeare, but before the next yeare come, 'Twas almost mounted to a double summe: It was sold at these hard Rates by another Lieutenant. (an honest religious Gentleman, and a good House-keeper) by the perswasions of some of his double diligent Seruants. Then I, in Scorne, Contempt, and vile Disgrace, Discarded was, and quite thrust from my place, There Bacchus almost cast me in the mire, And I from Wine to Water did retire. But when the blinde misiudging world did see, The strange vnlook'd for parting of vs Three, To heare but how the multitude did judge, How they did mutter, mumble, prate and grudge, That for some Against all the world I oppose my selfe in this poynt, but yet I purpose to confesse more, then any man can accuse me of. faults I surely had committed, I, in disgrace thus from my place was quitted. These imputations grieu'd me to the heart, (For they were causlesse and without desert) And therefore, though no man aboue the Ground That knew the Botles would giue Twenty Except he were a Foole, or a Madman. pound Rather then I would branded be with shame, And beare the burthen of desertlesse blame, To be an Owle, contemptuously bewondred, I would I did heare that that Lieutenant was to leaue his place, which made me bargaine with him at any price, in hope that he would not stay the full Receiuing, which fell out as I wished it. giue threescore, fourescore, or a hundred. For I did vow, although I were vndone, I would redeeme my credit ouerrunne, And 'tis much better in a Iayle to rot, To suffer Begg'ry, Slauery, or what not, Then to be blasted with that wrong of wrongs, Which is the poyson of Backbiting tongues. Hoysted aloft vnto this mounting taxe, Bound fast in Bonds in Parchment and with waxe, Time gallop'd, and brought on the payment day, And for three Moneths I eighteene pounds did pay. Then I confesse, I play'd the Thiefe in graine, And for one Bottle commonly stole twaine. But so who buyes the place, and meanes to thriue, Must many times for one take foure or fiue. For this I will maintaine and verifie, It is an office no true man can buy. And by that reason sure I should say well, It is vnfit for any man to sell: For till at such an extreame rate I bought, To filch or steale, I scarcely had a thought. And I dare make a vow 'fore God and men, I neuer playd the Thiefe so much as then. But at the last my friendly starres agreed, That from my heauy bonds I should be That Lieutenant left his place, by which I was eased of my hard payments. freed: Which if I euer come into againe, Let hanging be the Guerdon for my paine. Then the By this Lieutenant that now is. old custome did againe begin, And to the Tower I brought the Bottles in, For which for seruing more then halfe a yeare, I (with much Loue) had wages and good cheere. Till one A desperate Clothworker, that did hunger and thirst to vndoe himselfe. most valiant, ignorantly stout, Did buy, and ouer-buy, and buy me out. Thus like times Footeball, was I often tost In Dock out Nettle, vp downe, blest and crost, Out-fac'd and fac'd, grac'd and againe disgrac'd, And as blind Fortune pleas'd, displac'd or plac'd. And thus, for ought my Augury is a kind of Soothsaying by the flight of Birds. Augury can see Diuorc'd and parted euer are we Three. Old Nabaoth, my case much is farre worse then thine, Thou but the Vineyard lost, I lost the Wine: Two witnesses (for bribes) the false accus'd, (Perhaps) some prating Knaues haue me abus'd: Yet thy wrong's more then mine, the reason why, For thou wast Naboath was stoned to death, so am not I. ston'd to Death, so am not I. But as the Dogs, did eate the flesh and gore Of Iezabell, that Royall painted Whore, So may the Gallowes eate some friends of mine, That first striu'd to remoue me from the Wine. This may by some misfortune be their lot, Although that any way I wish it not. But farewell bottles neuer to returne, Weepe you in Sacke, whilst I in Ale will mourne; Yet though you haue no reason, wit, or sence, I'le sencelesse chide you for your vile offence, That from your foster Father me would slide So dwell with Ignorance, a blind-fold guide, For who in Britaine knew (but My Bottles doe deserue a little reproofe. I) to vse you, And who but I knew how for to abuse you; My speech to you, no action sure can beare, From Scandala magnatum I am cleare. When Vpland Tradesmen thus dares take in hand A watry businesse, they not vnderstand: It did presage things would turne topsie turuy, And the conclusion of it would be scuruie, But leauing him vnto the course of Fate, Bottles let you and I a while debate, Call your extrauagant wild humours home, And thinke but whom you are departed from; I that for your sakes haue giuen stabs and stripes, To giue you sucke from Hogsheads and from Pipes, I that with paines and care you long haue nurst, Oft fill'd you with the best, and left the worst. And to maintaine you full, would often peirce, The best of Butts, a Puncheon, or a Teirce, Whil'st Pipes and Sackbuts were the Instruments That I playd on, to fill your full contents. With Bastart, Sack, with Allegant, and Rhenish, Your hungry mawes I often did replenish, With Malmesie, Maskadell, and Corcica, With White, Red, Claret, and Liatica, With Hollocke, Sherant, Malliga, Canara, I stuft your sides vp with a surserara, That though the world was hard, my care was still, To search and labour you might haue your fill, That when my Master did or sup or dine, He had his choyce of This was a credit to the Kings Castle, and to the Lieutenant thereof. fifteene sorts of Wine. And as good wines they were I dare be bold. As any Seller in this Land did hold. Thus from these Bottles I made honour spring, Befitting for the Castle of a King. This Royaltie my labour did maintaine, When I had meat and wages for my paine. Ingratefull Bottles, take it not amisse That I, of your vnkindnesse tell you this, Sure if you could speake, you could say in briefe, Your greatest want, was still my greatest griefe. Did I not often in my bosome hugge you, And in mine armes would (like a Father) hugge you, Haue I not run through Tempests, Gusts, and Stormes. And met with danger in strange various formes, All times and tydes, with, and against the streame, Your welfare euer was my labours Theame. Sleet, Raine, Haile, Winde, or Winters frosty chaps, Ioues Lightning, or his dreadfull Thunderclaps, When all the Elements in one conspire, Sad earth, sharpe ayre, rough water, flashing fire, Haue warr'd on one another, as if all This world of nothing, would to nothing fall. When showring Haile-shot, from the storming heau'n Nor blustering Gusts by Æols belching driuen. Could hold me backe, then oft I searcht and sought, And found, and vnto you the purchase brought. All weathers, faire, foule, Sunshine, wet and dry, I trauail'd still, your paunches to supply. Oft haue I fought, and swagger'd in your Right, And fill'd you still by eyther sleight or might. And in th'Exchequer I stood for your Cause, Else had you beene confounded by the Lawes. I did produce such I found and brought 3. witnesses that knew and tooke their oathes of the quantity of the Bottles for 50. yeares. witnesses which crost The Merchants sute, else you had quite beene lost, And (but for me) apparantly 'tis knowne, You had beene Kicksie winsie ouerthrowne, And for my Seruice and my much paines taken, I am cashier'd, abandon'd and forsaken. I knew it well, and said, and swore it too, That he that bought you, would himselfe vndoe, And I was promist, that when he gaue o're, That I should fill you, as I did before, For which foure yeares with patience I did stay, Expecting he would breake or run away, Which though it be falne out as I expected, Yet neuerthelesse my Seruice is rejected. Let men judge if I haue not cause to write Against my Fortune, and the worlds despight, That in my prime of strength, so long a 14. yeares. space, I toyl'd and drudg'd, in such a gainelesse place, Whereas the best part of my life I spent, And to my power gaue euery man content, In all which time which I did then remaine, I gaue no man occasion to complaine, For vnto all that know me, I appeale, To speake if well or ill I vs'd to deale, Or if there be the least abuse in me, For which I thus from you should sundred bee. For though my profit by you was but small, Yet sure my Gaine was Loue in generall. And that I doe not lye nor speake amisse, I can bring hundreds that can witnesse this, Yet for all this, I euer am put off, And made a scorne, a By-word and a scoffe. It must some villaines information be, That hath maliciously abused me, But if I knew the misinforming elfe, I would write lines should make him hang himselfe. Be he a great man that doth vse me ill, (That makes his will his Law, and Law his will) I hold a poore man may that great man tell, How that in doing ill, he doth not well, But Bottles blacke, once more haue at your breech, For vnto you I onely bend my speech Full foureteene times had Sols illustrious Rayes, Ran through the Zodiaske, when I spent my dayes To conserue, reserue, preserue and deserue, Your loues, wh? you with wants were like to starue. A Groce of Moones, and twice 12. months besides, I haue attended you all time and tides. If I gain'd Twelue pence by you all that time, May I to Tyburne for promotion Climbe, For though the blinde world vnderstand it not, I know there's nothing by you can be got, Except a drunken pate, a scuruy word, And now and then be tumbled ouer boord, And though these mischiefes I haue kept me fro, No other Bottleman could e're doe so, 'Tis knowne you haue beene stab'd, throwne in the Thames, And he that fild you beaten, with exclaimes, Marchants, who haue much abused bin Which Exigents, I neuer brought you in, But I with peace and quietnesse got more, Then any brabling e're could doe before. The Warders knowes, each Bottleman (but I) Had alwayes a crack'd crowne, or a blacke eye, Oft beaten like a Dog, with a scratch'd face, Turn'd empty, beaten backe with vile disgrace. These iniuries my selfe did bring in quiet, And still with peace I fild you free from Ryot. My labours haue beene dedicate to you, And you haue dealt with me, as with a Iew, For vnto thousand witnesses 'tis knowne. I did esteeme your welfare as mine owne, But an obiection from my words may runne, That seeing nothing by you may be wonne, Why I doe keepe this deale of doe about you When as I say, I can liue best without you. I answer, though no profit you doe bring, Yet there is many a profitable thing, Which I of This course neuer came into my minde, in 14. yeares whilst I kept the place. Marriners might often buy, Which vnto me would yeeld commodity. And I expected when the time should be That I should fill you, as 'twas promist me, Whereby some other profit might be got, Which I in former times remembred not, All which could do the Customehouse A Iarre of Oliues and Oyle, a few Potatoes, Oranges, Lemmons, and diuers other things, which a man may buy, get, and saue by. no wrong, Which to repeate here, would he ouer-long, But I was sleighted with most vile disgrace, And one that was my Prentise plac'd in The fellow was euer a true man to me, and I enuy not his happinesse, but yet I haue very foule play offerd me. place. But holla, holla, Muse come backe, come backe. I speake to none but you, you Bottles blacke. You that are now turn'd Monsters, most ingrate, Where you haue cause to loue most, most doe hate, You that are of good manners quite depriu'd, Worse then the Beast from whence you are deriu'd, If you be good for nothing but what's naught, Then sure you haue bin better fed then taught: Besides the world will taxe me, and say still The fault was mine, that nurtur'd you so ill. Persisting thus in your iniurious wrong, It shewes y'are drunke with being Empty long. Long fasting sure, hath made you weake and dull, For you are stedyest, when you are most full. Methinkes I heare you say the fault's not yours, You are commanded by Superior powers, But if the choyce were yours, you had much rather That I, than any one the Wines should gather. Alasse poore fooles, I see your force is weake, Complaine you cannot, wanting power to speake; If you had speech, it may be you would tell, How with you and the Merchants I dealt well, But 'tis no matter though you silent be, My fourteene yeares long seruice speakes for me. And for the Merchants still my friends did proue, I'le tell them somewhat to requite their Loue. First let their wisdomes but collect and summe, How many ships with wine doe yearely come, And they will finde that all these Bottles shall Not fill At 3. gallons from a ship, and from fome but 1 gallon and a halfe, I account 30. ships allowance is the quantitie of 1 Hogshead whereby it may be easily found in the Custome house if I speake true or not nine Hogsheads, at the most of all, Then he that for them Three Tonne dares to giue, The case is plaine, he must or beg or thieue. I doe not say that you haue beene abus'd, But you may partly guesse how you were vs'd, Indeed Now I speake of the bottles againe. I thinke we nere so soone had parted, Had friendly outsides bin but friendly harted, The sweet bate couers the deceiuing hookes, And false harts can put on good words and lookes. All is not gold the Prouerbe sayes that glisters, And I could wish their tongues were full of Blisters, That with their flatt'ring diligence most double, Themselues, and you, and I, thus much did trouble, For misinforming paltry Knaues must be The instruments of such indignity. But as the fairest Gardens haue some weeds And mongst the cleanest flocke, some scab'd sheepe breeds. Or as the Tare amongst the wheat doth grow, Good onely for what's ill, yet makes a show. They are made of Beast hide. So there's no greatnesse fixed on the ground, But Claw-backe Sycophants may there be found, For 'tis a Maxime held in euery Nation, Great men are waited on by Adulation. No doubt but some doth to the Court resort, And sure the Tower must imitate the Court, As Cæsrrs Pallace may (perhaps) haue many, So Cæsar Castle cannot say not any. I haue found some that with each wind would mone With harts all hatred, and with tongues all Loue, Who with hats mou'd, would take me by the fist, With Complements of honest Jacke how ist? I'm glad to see thee well with all my heart, Long haue I long'd to drinke with thee a quart, I haue beleeu'd this Drosse had beene pure Gold, When presently I haue beene bought and sold Behind my backe (for no desert and Cause) By those that kindly Cap'd and kist their Clawes. For one of them (an ancient Reuerend Scribe) Receiued forty shillings for a Bribe, On purpose so to bring the case about To put another in, and thrust me out. Long was the time this businesse was a brewing, Vntill fit oportunity accruing, I was displac'd, yet spight the bribed Sharke, The man that gaue the bribe did misse the marke. O Bottles, Bottles, Bottles, Bottles, Bottles, Platoes Diuine workes, not great Aristottles, Did ne're make mention of a guift so Royall, Was euer bought and sold like slaues disloyall. For since King Richard second of that name, (I thinke your high Prerogatiue you Claime: And thus much here to write I dare be bold You are r guift not giuen to be sold, For sence or reason neuer would allow, That you should e're be bought and sold till now. Phylosophers with all their Documents, Nor aged Times with all their monuments, Did euer mention such vntoward Elues, That did more idlely cast away themselues. To such low ebbe your basenesse now doth shrinke, Whereas you yearely did make thousands drinke. The hatefull title now to you is left, Y'are instruments of begg'ry and of Theft. But when I fild you (I dare boldly sweare) From all these imputations you were cleare, Against which I dare, dare, who dare or can, To answer him and meet him man to man, Truth armes me, with the which I will hold Bias, Against the shocke of any false Golias. Bottle you haue not wanted of your fill, Since you haue left me, by your heedlesse will, You scarce haue tasted penury or want, (For cunning Theeues are seldome ignorant) Yet many times you haue beene fild with trash, Scarce good enough your dirty skins to wash. All this I know, and this I did deuine, But all's one, Draffe is good enough for Swine. I doe not here inueigh, or yet Enuy, The places profit, none can come thereby, And in my hand it lyes (if so I please) To spoyle it, and not make it worth a Pease. And to the world I'le cause it to appeare. VVho e're giues for you twenty pounds a yeare. Must from the Marchants pilfer fourescore more, Or else he cannot liue and pay the score. And to close vp this point, I say in briefe, VVho buyes it is a Begger or a Thiefe, Or else a Foole, or to make all agree, He may be Foole, Thiefe, Begger, all the Three. So you false Bottles to you both adieu, The Thames for me, not a Denier for you. FINIS. VERBVM SEMPITERNVM. DEDICATED TO THE MOST GRACIOVS AND JLLVSTRIOVS KING CHARLES.

Faire flattering Dalilah, her Lord deceiues, He's tane himselfe, himselfe of life bereaues. The Beniamites abus'd a Leuites wife, For which all but sixe hundred lost their life. Ruth. (According to the flesh) this woman Ruth, Was ancient Grandame to th'eternall Truth. And though she from the Moabites doth come, It shewes th'Almighty in all Lands hath some. 1. Samuel. The Prophet Samuel's borne and Elies Sonnes To sinne and flat confusion headlong runnes. The Isralites are by the Lord forsaken, And by the Philistins the Arke is taken. The figur'd presence of this all in All, Doth make the Diuels inuention Dagon fall. God takes his people to his loue againe, The Ark's brought backe, the Philistines are slaine. The Sonnes of Samuel wrong their Fathers trust, By partiall Iudgements and with bribes vniust. Saul seeking straying Asses, findes a Crowne, And is annointed King in Raman towne. The fell Philistians Jsr'el doth oppresse, King Saul doth proudly gainst the Lord transgresse, God dids kill Agag, Saul will haue him spar'd, His will more than his Gods, he doth regard. Goliah armed leades an hoste from Gath, Defies the Lord of Hosts, prouokes his wrath. Yong Dauid comes, and in his hand a sling, And with a stone the Gyant downe doth ding. Old Ishays Sonne before the Kings preferr'd, And Dauid hath Sauls Daughter for reward. Th'ingratefull King, seekes Dauids causlesse death, True hearted Jonathan preserues his breath. Saul leaues his God, and to a Witch doth goe, And so himselfe, himselfe doth ouerthrow. The Philistines his childrens bloud doe spill, And with his Sword King Saul, King Saul did kill; Saul leaues his God, and to a Witch doth goe, And so himselfe, himselfe doth ouerthrow. The Philistines his childrens bloud did spill, And with his Sword King Saul King Saul did kill. 2. Samuel. King Dauids royall heart is fild with woe, For Ionathan and Saul, his friend, and foe, In Regall state he liues and flourisheth, And loues Sauls Grandchild lame Mephibosheth. Affection blinds him on Uriahs wife, T'accomplish which, her husband lost his life. The King's reprou'd by Nathan, and repents. And by repenting, heau'ns high wrath preuents. Incestuous Amnon, Absolon doth kill, For forcing Tamar gainst her Virgin will. He's reconcil'd vnto his louing Sire, And proudly to the Kingdome doth aspire. The old King flees, and ouer Jordane hies, The Sonne pursuing, and the Father flyes, Achitophel himselfe hangs in dispaire, And Absolon dyes hanged by the haire, The King for his rebellious Sonne doth mourne, His people numbred are at his returne, The Lord is wrath, the pestilence increast, That seuenty thousand dye, and then it ceast. 1. Kings. The Kingly Prophet (valiant Dæuid dyes,) His throne is left to Salomon the wise, False Adoniah, Ioab, Shimei kild, By his command, as erst his Father wild. With speed he sends for workmen from farre Coasts, To build a Temple to the Lord of Hosts, Before or after him was neuer such, That had of wisedome or of wealth so much. A thousand women, some wed, some vnwed, This wise King to Idolatry misled. He dyes and's buried by his fathers toome, And Rehoboam doth succeed his roome. Now Jsrael from Judah is diuided, Both Kingdomes by bad Kings are badly guided, Yet God to Iacobs seed doth promise keepe, And raises faithfull Pastors for his sheepe, 2 Kings. Eliah worketh wonders with his word, By inspiration of the liuing Lord: He's taken vp aliue, and his blest Spirit, Doth doubly in Elishaes breast inherit. Some Kings doe gouerne well, most gouerne ill, And what the good reformes, the bad doth spill. Till Isr'el, Iudah, King and Kingdome's lost, To great Nebuchadnezzar and his host. 1. Chronicles. Here euery Tribe is numbred to their names, To their memorials, and immortall fames, And Dauids acts t'instruct misguided men, Are briefly here recorded all agen. 2. Chronicles. The state of Israel, Judah, and their Kings, This Booke againe, againe Recordance brings. Their plagues of plague, of famine, slauery, sword, For their contemning heau'ns All sauing word, Manassehs Prayer. Manasseh almost drown'd in black despaire. Gaines mercy by repentance and by prayer. Ezra. The Persian Monarch (Cyrus) granteth leaue, The Jewes once more their freedome should receiue. When at Ierusalem they make abode, They all with zeale repaire the house of God. Malicious men (with poysnous malice fild) Makes Artaxerxes hinder those that build. Yet God so workes, that Israels loue and zeale, Resumes againe their ancient Church and weale. Nehemiah. The booke of Ezra doth concord with this, Commanding good, forbidding what's amisse. And godly Nehemiah here reform'd, What sinne and Sathan had long time deform'd. Esther. Here he that dwels in heauen doth deride, Queene Vshy's and ambitious Hamans pride, The Iewes are sau'd by Esters suite from death, And Haman and his Sons, hang'd, loose their breath. Poore Mordecay is held in high account, And to great greatnesse humbly he doth mount. Thus God doth raise all those his Lawes doe seeke, He layes the lofty low, exalts the meeke. Iob No losse of Sonnes and Daughters, goods and all, Make not this man into impatience fall, Assailing Sathan tempting wife, false friends, With perfect patience he all woes defends, I naked came (quoth he) into this world, And naked hence againe I shall be hurld. God giues and takes according to his word, And blessed euer bee the liuing Lord. Psalmes. The blessed Kingly Prophet sweetly sings, Eternall praises to the King of Kings. Gods Power, Iustice, Mercy, Fauour, looke For they are comprehended in this Booke. Prouerbs. The wisest man that euer man begot, In heauenly Prouerbs, shewes what's good what's not. Ecclesiastes. Health, strength, wit, valour, wordly wisdome, pelfe, All's nought, and worse then vanity it selfe. Salomons song. This Song may well be call'd, the Song of Songs, It to the heauenly Bride, and Groome belongs. It truely shewes Christs loue vnto his loue, His Church, his Wife, his Virgin Spouse, his Doue. Isaiah. This worthy Prophet truely doth foretell, How Christ shall come to conquer death and hell, Rewards vnto the godly he repeats, And to the godlesse he denounceth threats. Jeremy. This Man of God long time before foreshoes, Ierusalems Captiuity and woes. Lamentations. He wishes here, his head a fountaine deepe, That he might weepe, weepe, nothing else but weep. That he might gush forth flowing streames of teares For Iudah's thraldome, misery, and feares. Ezechiel. In Babylon this Prophet Captiue is, And there he prophesies of bale and blisse. How all must come to passe the Lord hath said, How Iudgement surely comes, although delayd. Daniel. The Kings darke dreame, the Prophet doth expound, For which, he's highly honour'd and renown'd. Nabuchadnezzar doth an Image frame, Commands all paine of death t'adore the same. Three godly Iewes by no meanes will fall downe, And for contempt are in the fornace throwne. Where, midst the flames vnhurt they sweetly sing, Which wonder doth conuert the tyrant King. Here Daniel Prophesies of Christ to come, Of Babel, Persia, Græcia, and Rome. Hosea. He tels misgouern'd Israel their sinnes, And how the losse of grace, destruction winnes. Joel. This Prophet tels the stubborne-hearted Iewes, How heau'ns consuming wrath apace ensues. He therefore doth perswade them to contrition, And by contrition they shall haue remission. Amos. Mans thanklesse heart, and Gods vnmeasur'd loue, This Prophet doth to Isr'els faces proue. Obadiah. He comforts Judah (ouer-prest with woes,) And prophesies destruction of their foes. Jonah. Here Jonah tels the Niniuites, except Repentance wrath of Heauen doe intercept: In forty dayes, high, low, rich, poore, great, small, The Lords hot fury shall consume them all. With hearts vnfaign'd, the sinfull Citie mournes, The Lord grants mercy, Ionah backe returnes. Micah. He speakes of Isr'els and of Juda's crimes, And tels them their confusion comes betimes. Nahum. The Niniuites againe forsake the Lord, And are subdu'd by the Assirian sword. This Prophet comforts those that are opprest, And tels the godly, they shall be releast. Habakkuk. He doth bewaile th'oppression of the poore, For mercy, humbly he doth God implore. To keepe the Captiu'd Iewes from fell despaire, He teaches them a heauenly forme of Prayer. Zephaniah. He fils the good with hope, the bad with feare, And tels the Iewes their thraldome draweth neere. Haggay. He exhorteth them to patience in their paine, And bids them build the Temple once againe. Zachariah. He tels the Iewes why they haue plagued beene, He bids them shunne Idolatry, and sinne. Malachi. For sinne he doth reproue both Prince and Priest, And shewes the comming both of John and Christ. Which Christ shall be a Sauiour vnto all, That with true faith obey his heauenly call. Apocrypha. These bookes doe all in generall intimate The State of good men, and the reprobate. In many places they doe seeme to vary, And beare a sence from Scripture quite contrary. In Tobit and Dame Iudith disagrees, From Text, and Razes in the Machabees. For which the Church hath euer held it fit, To place them by themselues, from holy writ. FJNJS. SALVATOR MVNDI. DEDICATED. TO THE HIGH MAIESTIE OF QVEENE MARY. Great Queene, J haue with paines and labour tooke From out the greatest Booke this little Booke. And with great Reuerence J haue cull'd from thence, All things that are of greatest consequence And though the Uolumne and the Worke bee small, Yet it containes the summe of all in ALL. To you J giue it, with a heart most feruent, And rest your humble Subiect, and your Seruant. Iohn Taylor. To the Reader. Heere Reader thou maist read for little cost, How thou wast ransom'd, when thou quite wast lost. Mans gracelesnesse, and Gods exceeding grace, Thou here maist reade and see in little space. Iohn Taylor. Mathew. Loe here the blessed Sonne of God and Man (New borne) who was before all worlds began, Of heau'nly seed th'eternall liuing Rocke Of humane race, of Kingly Dauids stocke. Our blest Redeemer, whom the Prophets old In their true preachings had so oft foretold. In figures, ceremonies, types and tropes, He here fulfils their words, confirmes their hopes. The worlds saluations sole and totall summe, Poore Mankinds Sauiour, Iesvs Christ is come. From married Mary, wife and Virgin, springs This heauenly, earthly, supreame King of Kings. He's naked borne, and in a manger layd, Where he and's Mother (blessed wife and maid) Are by the wise men sought, and seeking found, And hauing found, their ioyes doe all abound. Where they their loue, their zeale, their faith vnfold, And offer incense, myrthe, and purest gold. False-hearted Herod seeketh to destroy This new borne Infant, our eternall joy. But Joseph by a dreame is warn'd by night, T'ward Ægypt with the Babe to take his flight. Amongst th'Ægyptians he not long soiournes, But backe to Naz'reth he againe returnes. To end the Law, the Babe was circumcis'd, And then by John in Iordane was baptiz'd. When loe the Father from his glorious Throne, Sends downe the Holy Ghost vpon his Sonne. In likenesse of a pure vnspotted Doue, Which did his Birth and Baptisme both approue. Now subtill Sathan he attempts and tempts him, And fasting, to the wildernesse exempts him. But Iesus power the foule fiends power destroyd, Commanding Sathan hence, Auoyd, Auoyd. The fearefull Diuell doth flee, Christ goes and preaches, And in the Mountaine multitudes he teaches. He said, Repentance wipes away transgressings, And to the godly he pronounced blessings. Hee makes the lame to goe, the blind to see, Deafe heare, dumbe speake, the leapers cleansed be. The diuels from the possessed out he draue, The dead are rais'd, the poore the Gospell haue. Such things he doth, as none but God can doe, And all's to bring his flock his fold vnto. All that are laden come to me (quoth he) And I will ease you, therefore come to me. You of your heauy sinnes I doe acquite, My yoake is easie and my burden's light Vpon Mount Taber there our blest Messias, Doth shew himselfe with Moses and Elias. Yet all these mightie wonders than he wrought, Nor all the heauenly teachings that he taught, The stiffe neckd stubborne Iewes could not conuert, But they ramaine obdurate, hard of heart. The man (quoth some) by whom these things are done It is the Carpenters, poore Iosephs Sonne. Some said how he these things to passe did bring By power of Belzebub th'infernall King. Thus with the poyson of their ennious tongues, They guerdon good with ill, and right with wrongs, His owne not knowes him, Judas doth betray him, To Annas and to Caiphas they conuey him. From Caiphas backe to Annas, and from thence Is sent this euerlasting happy Prince. Thus is this death, this sin, this Sathan-killer, Mongst sinnefull wretches tost from post to Piller. He's flouted, spitted on, derided, stript, He's most vnmercifully scourg'd, and whipt. By Impious people, he's blasphem'd and rail'd, And of the Iewes in (scorne) as King is hail'd. He like a Lambe vnto his death is led, Nail'd on the Crosse for man, his heart bloud shed, He (after three dayes) glorious doth arise, He leaues the sinnefull earth, and mounts the skyes. But first to his Disciples he appeares, Where he their drooping halfe dead Spirits cheares. Marke. Saint Marke declares how blest baptizing Iohn, Fore-runner was of Gods eternall Son. Which John in Wildernesse baptizes, teaches, And of contrition and remission preaches. Our Sauiour calls no Pharisees or Scribes, Or princely people out of Iudahs Tribes. But Simon, Andrew, Iames and John are those, Poore toyling Fishermen which Iesus chose, To shew that with the humblest smallest things, God greatest matters to perfection brings. By sundry wondrous workes our Sauiour Iesus, From sinne and Sathan lab'reth to release vs. And in requitall the Ingratefull Iewes Deuise their blest Redeemer to abuse. Some inwardly doe hate him, some belye him, His Seruants all forsake him, or deny him. But Peter thou wast blest in thy deniall, Of thy presuming thou hast found the tryall. Repentance washt away thy frailties crimes, And thou a patterne art to after times, The Sonne and Heire of neuer fading Heau'n, Into the hands of sinfull men is giuen. He dyes, he's buried, and in glory rises, Triumphing ouer all his foes deuises, S. Luke. Heere Mary and old Zacharias sings, In ioyfull manner to the King of Kings. And aged Simeon in his armes did take, The Lord of life and doth reioycings make. Christ teaches, preaches mercy vnto all, That by amendment will for mercy call. He's tane, and by false witnesses accus'd, He's beaten, scoffed, scorned and abus'd. He's hang'd vpon the Crosse betwixt two theeues, The one doth rails on him, and one beleeues. He dies, he's buried; rising he doth quell And conquer all his foes, sin, death, and hell. S. John. In the beginning was th'eternall Word, The Word with God was, and that Word the Lord. In the beginning the same Word with God Was, and for euer hath with him aboad, With it were all things made, and made was nought Without this Word, the which was made or wrought Here Christs Diuinity is told by John, The blessed Trinitie, one three, three one. How God had now perform'd the oath he swore, To Abram, and to Jsrael long before. How Christ should come to ransome Adams losse, And satisfie Gods Iustice on the crosse, Though times and places farre a sunder be, Yet Prophets and Euangelists agree. In Iesus birth, his Doctrine, life and death, Whereby our dying Soules gaine liuing breath. If all things should be writ which erst was done, By Iesus Christ, (Gods euerlasting Sonne) From Cratch to Crosse, from Cradle to his tombe, To hold the Bookes, the world would not be roome. Acts. Th'Apostles praising God, and singing Songs, The holy Ghost in fierie clouen tongues, Descends vpon them, who are all inspir'd, With learned languages adorn'd admir'd, Saint Peter preaching, tels the people plaine, How they the liuing Lord of life had slaine. Some flout and mocke, remaining stubborne-hearted, And many Soules peruerted are conuerted. The Church increases, daily numbers comes, And to the Gospels furth'ring giue great Summes. Acts. False Ananias and his faithlesse wife, In dreadfull manner lost their wretched life. The enuious people stone the Martyr Steuen, He praying for his foes, leaues earth for Heauen. The Churches Arch-foe, persecuting Saul, Is made a conuert, and a preaching Paul. He's clapt in Prison, manacled and fetter'd, And through his troubles, still his zeale is better'd. Th'Apostle Iames, by Herod's put to death, And Herod eat with Lice, lost hatefull breath. Th'increasing Church amongst the Gentiles spreds, By Nero, Paul, and Peter, lost their heads. Romanes. Th'Apostle Paul from Corinth writes to Rome, To strength their faith, and tell them Christ is come. He shewes how high and low, both Iew and Greeke Are one with God, who faithfully him seeke. He tels how sinne in mortall bodies lurkes, How we are sau'd by faith, and by workes. In louing tearmes, the people he doth moue, To Faith, to Hope, to Charity, and Loue. 1. Corinths. Paul to Corinthus from Philippy sends, Their Zeale, and Faith he louingly commends. He tels them if Gods seruice they regard, Th'eternall Crowne of life is their reward. 2. Corinths. In this Saint Paul sends the Corinthians word, Afflictions are the blessings of the Lord. He doth desire their Faith may still increase, He wishes their prosperity and peace. Galathians. He tels them that their whole Saluations cause, Is all in Christ, and not in Moses Lawes. The Law's a glasse where men their sinnes doe see, And that by Christ we onely saued be. Ephesians. Paul bids cast off the old man with his vice, And put on Christ, our blest redemptions price. Philippians. He bids them of false teachers to beware, He tels them that Humilitie is rare: And though they liue here in a vaile of strife, Yet for them layd vp is the Crowne of life. Colossians. Th'Apostle doth reioyce, and praiseth God, That these Colossians in true Faith abode. He praiseth them he bids them watch and pray, That sin and Sathan worke not their decay. 1. Thessalonians. He thanketh God, his labour's not in vaine, So stedfast in the faith these men remaine, That they to others are a blessed light, By their example how to liue vpright. 2. Thessalonians. Againe to them, he louingly doth write: He bids them pray the Gospell prosper might. He wishes them prosperitie and wealth, And in the end, Soules euerlasting health. 1. and 2. to Timothy. Paul shewes to Timothy, a Byshop must, In life and doctrine be sincere and iust. And how the Scriptures power haue to perswade, Whereby the man of God is perfect made. Titus. To Titus ('mongst the Creetans) Paul doth send, And warnes him what t'allow, or reprehend. Philemon. Paul earnestly the Master doth request, To pardon his poore man that had transgrest. Hebrewes. Although this booke doth beare no Authors name, It shewes the Iews how they their liues should frame And that the Ceremoniall Law is ended In Christ, in whom all grace is comprehended. S. Iames. Heare, speake, and doe well, the Apostle saith, For by thy workes, a man may see thy faith. 1 and 2. to Peter. He counsels vs, be sober, watch and pray, And still be ready for the Iudgemen day. 1, 2. and 3. of Iohn. He shewes Christ di'de, and from the graue arose, To saue his friends, and to confound his foes. S. Jude. Iude bids them in all Godlinesse proceed, And of deceiuing teachers to take heed. Reuelation. Diuine S. Iohn to Pathmos Ile exilde, This heauenly worke t'instruct vs he compild. He tels the godly, God shall be their gaines, He threats the godlesse with eternall paines. He shewes how Antichrist should reigne and rage, And how our Sauiour should his pride asswage. How Christ in glory shall to Iudgement come, And how all people must abide his doome. A Prayer. Good God Almighty, (in compassion tender,) Preserue and keepe King Charles, thy Faiths defender, Thy Glory, make his Honor still increase, In Peace, in Warres, and in Eternall peace. Amen. FINIS. THE BOOKE OF MARTYRS. DEDICATED TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, WILLIAM, EARLE OF Pembrooke, &amp;c. [The First Part.] My Lord, my weake Collection out hath tooke, The summe and pith of the great Martyrs Booke: For pardon and protection J intreat, The Volume's little, my presumption great. Iohn Taylor. I sing their deaths (who dying made death yeeld By Scriptures sword, and faiths vnbattered shield Whom Sathan, men, or monsters could not tame Nor force them to deny their Sauiours name. Euangelists that did the Gospell write, Apostles, and braue Martyrs, that did sight. Gainst death and hell, and all the power of sin, And boldly di'de eternall life to win. Iohn Baptist by King Herod lost his head, Who to the world repentance published. Our blest Redeemer in his loue did follow, And conquered death, mans sinfull soule to hallow. He was the death of death, and he did quell The sting and power of Sathan, sin and hell. And vnder his great standard, valiantly, A number, numberlesse haue darde to die. Through bondage, famine, slauery, sword, and fire, Through all deuised torments they aspire. Victoriously to gaine th'immortall Crowne, Of neuer-ending honour and renowne, Saint Steuen was the third that lost his breath, And (for his Masters sake) was ston'd to death, And after him in Scripture may we reade, The Apostle Iames was brain'd and butchered, Saint Marke th'Euangelist in fire did burne, And Bartholmew was flead, yet would not turne, Saint Andrew like a valliant champion dide, And (willing) on a crosse was crucifide. Matthias, Philip, Peter, and Saint Paul, Ston'd, crucified, beheaded, Martyrs all. Th'Apostles of their liues no reckoning make, And thinke them well-spent for their Sauiours sake, The tyrant Emperours, in number ten, (Most cruell, barb'rous, and inhumaine men) More Christians by their bloudy meanes did slay, Then for a yeere fiue thousand to each day, And many Romane Bishops in those dayes, Were Martyrd, to their high Creators praise, And though each day so many thousands bleed, Yet doubtly more and more they daily breed. As Camomile growes better being trod, So death and tortures draw more vnto God, Or as the vine thats cut and prun'd beares more, In one yeere then it did in three before, This bloudy persecution did out-weare, After Christs death the first three hundred yeere, Thus did the primitiue first Church endure, Being Catholike, Apostolike, and pure, Then ouer all the world twas truely knowne, That Romish Bishops claimed but their owne, In their owne Diocesse to be chiefe Pastor, And not to be the worlds great Lord and master, And now our Britaine glory will I sing From Lucius reign, the worlds first Christian King. Vnto these dayes of happy peacefull state, A Catalogue of Martyrs Ile relate. First, Ursula, and eleuen thousand with her, Al Virgins, for Christs faith did dye together. Then Hengist with the Saxons hither came, Who many kild with sword and furious flame. Besides eleuen hundred Monkes were kild, At Bangar Abby all their blouds were spild. And when the Saxons race to end was run, The Danes came in, and all the Kingdome won. Before whose Swords did many thousands fall, Which on the name of Iesvs Christ did call. Then William Conquerour with a multitude, Vnto the Normans voake this Land subdude. The Pope then caus'd all Priests to leaue their wiues, To leade foule Sodomiticke single liues. Then afterward in second Henries raigne. Was sawcy Sir Saint Thomas Becket slaine. A Popish Saint and Martyr made, because He dy'd a Traytor to his Soueraignes Lawes. King Henry and King Richard dead and gone. Their brother Iohn (by right) ascends the Throne. Whom all his life, the Pope of Rome did vexe, And with oppressions all the Realme perplexe. With Candle, Booke, and Bell, he curst and blest, And Bals, and Legates did the King molest: Vntill such time he on his knees fell downe, And to the Pope surrendred vp his Crowne. At last, because he durst the Pope withstand, He dyed imposned by a Fryers hand. When thus by treason, they had kild King Iohn, Then the third Henrie, Englands Crowne put on. Then England bought the Romish doctrine deare, It cost her threescore thousand markes a yeare, For Agnus Deies, Pardons Peter-pence, For which the Pope had all this coine from hence, King Henry dyed, then Edward tooke the sway, His Sonne and Grandchild England did obay, The first of them call'd Long-shanks conquests won, Lost by Carnaruan his vnhappy Son. Who by his Queene was in a Dungeon cast, Till (being murthered) sadly breath'd his last. Edward the third a braue victorious King, Did Frenchmens pride into subiection bring. Richard the second next to raigne began, Who lost more than his Royall Grandsire wan: Then gan Iohn Wickliffe boldly to begin, To preach gainst Antichrist, that man of sin. Who many troubles stoutly did abide, Yet (spight the Pope) he naturally dy'de. And being dead, from out his graue was turn'd, And had his Martyr'd bones to ashes burn'd. Which ashes they, did cast into a Brooke, Because he had the Romish Faith forsooke. Yet whilst the second Richard here suruiu'd, No Martyrs were by fire of life depriu'd. Henry the fourth was in the Throne inuested, In whose Reigne many were too much molested. And Willivm Sautre first his life did giue, Through flames of fire, who now in heauen doth liue. The next John Badby in the furious flame, And William Thorpe, both wan immortall fame. Then the fifth Henrie a victorious Prince, The Realme of France did conquer and conuince. The good Lord Cobham then (Oldcastle nam'd) By Popish Priests an Hereticke proclaim'd, Washang'd and burn'd by the vnlawfull doome, Of Sathans Seruants, slaues to Hell and Rome. And leauing some vnnam'd, Iohn Browne Esquire, John Beuerly a Preacher dyed in fire. Besides a number from the Lollards Towre, Rackes, tortures, halters, and the flame deuoure. Iohn Hi[illeg.] a glorious Martyr of the Lord. Was in Bohemia burned for Gods word And reuerend Ierome did to Constance come From Prague, and stoutly suffered Martyrdome. In Smith-field one Iohn Claydon suffered death, And with him Richard Turming lost his breath. At this time sixeteene godly folkes in Kent, The Antichristian vassals did torment. Then death cut off the fifth King Henries Raigne, The Crowne the sixth King Henrie did obtaine. And William Taylor, a true zealous Priest, Did passe through fire vnto his Sauiour Christ, Good Richard Houedon, with him William White, Each vnto God (through fire) did yeeld his sprite. Duke Humphrey, though no Martyr, kil'd in's bed, And Richard Wych a Priest was burned dead. Then Saint-like good King Henry was depos'd, By the fourth Edward, in the tower inclos'd, Then Edward fled, and Henry once againe By Warwickes power the Kingdome did obtaine. Thds did the various state of humane things, Make Kings of Captiues, and of Captiues Kings. Vntill at last King Edward turning backe, Brought Henries royalty to small wracke. In whose Raigne Iohn Goose (as the story saith) Was the first Martyr burned for Christs faith, King Henry in the Tower was stab'd to death, And Edward yeelded vp his life and breath. His Sonne young Edward of that name the fift, Whom the third Richard from his life did lift. VVho by foule murthers, bloud and tyranny, Vsurpt the Throne of Englands Monarchy, Till valiant Henry of that name the seuen, Kild him, and made vneuen England euen, Then first Ioane Boughtor, and a man call'd Babram, By faith (through fire) went to old Father Abram. An Old man was in Smithfield burnt because, He did resist against the Roman Lawes. One Ierom hang'd and burned on the Gallowes In Florence, with two other of his fellowes. And William Tillesworth, Thomas Bernard, and Iames Morton, cause they did the Pope withstand, Burn'd all, and Father Rogers, and o'd Reine, Did dye by fire, a better life to gaine. One Thomas Nouice, and one Thomas Chafe, Dy'd constant Martyrs by the Heauenly Grace. A woman and a man call'd Laurence Guest, By Death gain'd euerlasting life and rest. Besides a number past mans reckoning vp, For Iesvs sake dranke of afflictions cup. Some carried faggots through a world of mocks, Some rack'd, some pinde, some fettered in the stocks. Some naked stript, and scourged with a lash, For their reiecting of their Romish trash. Some branded in the cheeke, did alwayes beare, The marke and badge of their Redeemer deare. Thus the insulting tyrannizing Pope, With cursings, tortures, fire, and sword and rope. Did force the Soules and Consciences of men, To run dispairing to damnations Den, And those who valiantly his power withstood, Did seale their resolution with their bloud. Before his triple, treble, trouble Crowne, (In adoration) Emperours must fall downe. Were they as high as any Cæsar borne, To kisse his feet they must not hold it scorne, Henry the sixth, the Emperour did fall downe, Whom with his Feet Pope Celestine did Crowne. Henry the fourth, his Empresse and his young Son. All three to Rome did barefoot goe and run. And three dayes so, thesethree did all attend, His holinesse a godlesse eare to lend. Which afterward was granted, on condition That he should giue his Crowne vp in submission. Pandulphus the Popes Legate with a frowne, Did make King Iohn of England yeeld his Crowne: King Henry of that name the second, he Kneel'd downe, and kist the Romish Legats knee: The Emperour when Pope Adrian was toride, Did hold his stirrop on the neere wrong side: For which his Holinesse in angry sort, Disdainfully did checke the Emperour for't, When as the Pope doth ride in Cope of gold, Kings (like to foot-men) must his bridle hold. In pompe he must bee borne vpon mens shoulders, With glorious shew amazing the beholders. Whilst Kings and Princes must before him goe, To vsher him in this vaine-glorious show. This being true as no man can deny, Those that will not be blinde may plainely spy, That their insulting proud commanding Priest, Is absolute, and onely Antichrist. H'exalts himselfe 'boue all thats' called God. Vpon the Emperours necke he proudly trod. Hee is th'abomination (vord of grace) That mounts himselfe into the holy place, He makes the Princes of the Earth drinke vp, And quaffe the poyson of his cursed Cup. Who being drunken with the dregs of sinne, They haue his sworne and forsworne vassals beene, Bewitched with his foule Inchanting charmes, Gainst one another they haue rose in armes. By forreine and domesticke bloudie broyles, Whilst he hath fild his his coffers with their spoyles. His double dealing too plaine appeares. In setting Christian Princes by the eares. Whilst he into his auaritious hands, Hath seiz'd their persons, moueables and lands. And as the Christian Kings themselues made weake, The Turke into their Kingdomes gan to breake. And thus the Turke and Pope joynd with the deuill, Haue beene the authors of all Christian euill. FJNJS. The Second Part. DEDICATED TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, PHILLIP, EARLE OF Montgomerie, &amp;c. My Lord, the liues and deaths of Saints and Kings, This little Booke vnto your Greatnesse sings: Protection and acceptance if you giue, Jt shall (as shall Your selfe) for ever liue. Iohn Taylor. VVhen the 7 Henry in his graue was laid, And the eight Henry, Englands Scepter sway'd, Romes bloudy persecution raged more In England, than in ten Kings raignes before. And therefore Reader, in this little Booke. For euery Martyrs name thou must not looke. But men of chiefest note, respect and fame, That dyed in England, onely these I name. And first the Papists tyranny beganne, In murthering Richard Hun, a zealous man, For being kept in prison by their power, They closly hang'd him in the Lollards Tower. And then they all in generall decreed, Reporting Hun himselfe had done the deed. Ann sixteene dayes iust after this was don, They burn'd the foresaid corps of Richard Hun. Then to the number of full thirty fiue, The furious flames did all of life depriue. In seuerall places of this wofull land, Because they did the Pope of Rome withstand. At which time Thomas Bilney did begin, To preach and teach against Antichristian sinne. Where in Saint Georges Church in Ipswich Towne, The Papists from the Pulpit pluckt him downe. And as in dolefull prison he did lie, He put his finger in the flames to try, He prou'd, and God did giue him strength to beare His death, to liue with his Redeemer deare. The next of note, was one Iohn Frith, a man Of learning great, a Martyrs same he wan. Then learned Luther, and graue Zwinglius, With Caluin, Beza, Occolampadius, All glorious, gracious, reuerend lamps of light, Were instruments to cleare blear'd Englands sight. In Flanders, William Tindall for Gods Word, Was Sacrific'd to glorifie the Lord. John Lambert valiantly his death did take, And burn'd in Smithfield for his Sauiour sake. About this time that Honourable man, Lord Cromwels life, and timelesse death began. Hee like an Earthquake made the Abbies fall, The Fryeries, the Nunneries, and all. This famous Noble, worthy Essex Earle, This Iemme, this Iewell, this most orient pearle, Was for his truth from all he had discarded, And with his heads losse all his faith rewarded. The next of worthy note by fire that dide, Was good Anne Askew, who did strong abide, Rackes, tortures, and the cruell raging flame, To magnifie her high Creators name. Then gan the Kings eyes to be opened quite, Inlightened by the euerlasting light. He banisht Superstitious idle fables, And packt the Papists hence with all their bables. Then Bonner, Gardner, Brethren both in euill, Factors and Actors, bloudhounds for the Deuill. Their burning fame to infamy soone faded, They Godlesse, gracelesse, were disgracst, degraded. The King thus hauing this good worke begun, He dyed and left the Kingdome to his Sonne. Then raign'd young Edward, that sweet Princely childe, By whom all Popery was cleane exilde, But he too good to liue mongst wicked men, Th'Almighty tooke him hence to Heauen agen. No sooner Edward was laid in his Tombe, But England was the slaughter-house of Rome. Gardner and Bonner were from prison turn'd, And whom they pleas'd were eyther sau'd or burn'd. Queene Mary imitating Iezabell, Aduanc'd againe the Ministers of Hell, Then tyranny began to tyrannize, Tortures and torments then they did deuise. Then Master Rogers with a faith most feruent, Was burn'd, and dy'd in Smithfield Gods true Seruant. Next vnto him did Laurence Sanders dye, By fire (for Iesus sake at Couentry. He did embrace and kindly kisse the stake, To gaine Heau'ns glory, did the world forsake. Good Byshop Hooper, was at Gloster burn'd, Cause he against the Romish Doctrine spurn'd, And Doctor Taylor, a true zealous man, At Hadly burn'd, eternall glory wan, Then Byshop Ferrar next his life did spend, In fire to gaine the life shall neuer end. Next William Fowler first did loose his hand, Then burn'd, because the Pope he did withstand, In Essex Thomas Hawkes with faith victorious, Did dye by fire, to gaine a life most glorious, Master John Bradford (for his Sauiours sake, In Smithfield burn'd a godly end did make, Two reuerend Byshops, Father Latimer. And Ridley each of them a heauenly starre, Liu'd in Gods feare, and in his fauour dy'd, At Oxford burn'd, and now are glorifi'd, Iohn Philpot gladly did the fire embrace, And died and liues in his Redeemers grace. Then that graue Father and religious man. Arch-Bishop of Cranmars troubles hot began. His Pompe, his state, his glory, and his pride, Was to know Iesus, and him crucifide: He liu'd a godly Preacher of Gods Word, And dy'd a glorious Martyr of the Lord. John Carcles in close Prison carefully. Did change his cares for ioyes eternally. But this small volume cannot well containe One quarter of the Saints in England flaine, In Henries Raigne and Maries (cruell Queene) Eight thousand people there hath slaughtered beene, Some by the Sword, some Hang'd, some burnt in fire, Some staru'd to death in Prison, all expire. Twelue thousand and seuen hundred more beside, Much persecuting trouble did abide. Some wrackt, som whipt, som tortur'd som in stocks, Some doing penance with a world of mockes, Some with an yron in the faces burn'd, Some out of all their goods to beggry turn'd Some barefoot, bearing faggots on their shoulders, Were made a wondring stocke to the beholders, All this, and more, much more they did endure, Because they would not yeeld to liue impure. But now to speake the lawlesse cause wherefore, And why these people troubled were so sore, Because they would not make their plaints &amp; mones, To senseles Images, dead stockes and stones. Because they said the Sacramentall bread, Is not the Lord, which shall iudge quick and dead. Because they not beleeue'd a Purgatory, And held the Popes decrees an idle story. Because they would not creepe vnto the crosse, And change Gods sacred Word for humane drosse. Because they held the Masse and doll foule, At once, which pickt the purse, &amp; damn'd the Soule. Because they knew the Pope, and all his crue, Hel hounds, wh? heauen (in rage) on earth did spue. And in a word, they thus were ouer-trod, Because they truly seru'd the liuing God, This was the maine, and onely cause of all, Because they would not offer vnto Baæl. The Popes outragious and couragious actor, Was Bishop Bonner, hells most trusty factor, Romes hangman, and the firebrand of this Realme, That with a floud of bloud did ouerwhelme, The true beleeuers of Gods holy truth, He butchered, not regarding age or youth. With him was ioyn'd a man almost as ill. Who tooke delight Gods seruants bloud to spill, Cal'd Stephen Gardner, Englands Chanceller, And Bishop of the Sea of Winchester, These two did striue each other to excell, Who should doe greatest seruice vnto Hell, Vntill at last God heard his seruants cry, And each of them did die immediately, Thus when Iehouah heard the iust complaints, Of his beloued poore afflicted Saints, Then this too cruell Pope defending Queene, (The bloudiest Princesse that this land hath seene) She did decease, and persecution ceast; And tired, wofull Englands purchast rest, Queene Mary, being dead her welcome death. Reuiu'd our ioyes in blest Elizabeth, Innumerable were her woes and cares, Abundance were the subtill wiles and snares. Which Sathan and his Ministers oft laid, To reaue the life of that most harmelesse Maid; She was accus'd, abus'd, reuil'd, miscal'd, She was from prison vnto prison hal'd. Long in the Tower she shas close prisner shut. Her louing seruants all way were put, From thence to Windsor, thence to Woodstocke sent, Closely mewd vp from all the worlds content. But God whose mercies euer did defend her, Did in her greatest Sorrow comfort send her. He did behold her from his Throne on hie, And kept her as the apple of his eye. Let Hell and Hell-hounds still attempt to spill, Yet the Almighty guards his Seruants still, And he at last did ease her Sorrowes mone, And rais'd her to her lawfull awfull throne. This Royall Deborah, this Princely Dame, Whose life made all the world admire her fame. As Iudith in Bethulias fame was spread, For cutting off great Holophernes head: So our Eliza stoutly did begin, Vntopping and beheading Romish sin, Shee purg'd the Land of Papistry agen, Shee liu'd belou'd of God, admir'd of men. Shee made the Antichristian Kingdome quake, She made the mighty power of Spaine to shake. As farre as Sunne and Moone dispears'd her Rayes, So farre and farther, went her matchlesse praise, She was at home, abroad, in euery part, Loadstar and Loadstone to each eye and heart. Supported onely by Gods powerfull hand, She foure and forty yeares did rule this Land: And then she left her Royall Princely Seat, She chang'd earths greatnesse to be heauenly great. Thus did this Westerne Worlds great wonder dye, She fell from height to be aduanc'd more hie. Terrestriall Kings and Kingdomes, all must fade, Then blest is she, that is immortall made. Her death fild woefull England full of feares, The Papists long'd for change with itching eares, For her decease was all their onely hope, To raise againe the doctrine of the Pope. But he whose power is all omnipotent, Did their vnhappy hopelesse hopes preuent. Succession lawfully did leaue the Crowne, Vnto a Prince, whose vertue and Renowne, And learning did out-strip all Kings as farre, As doth the Sunne obscure a little starre. What man that is but man, could baffle more Romes seauen headed purple beastly Whore? How wisely hath he Bellarmine confuted, And how diuinely hath he oft disputed? How zealously he did Cods faith defend, How often on Gods word he did attend. How clement, pious, and how gracious good Was he, as sits the greatnesse of his bloud. Were't not for him how should the Muses doe? He was their patterne, and their patron too. He was th'Apollo from whose radient Beames, The quintessence of Poetry out-streames, And from the splendor of his piercing rayes, A world of worthy writers won the bayes, Yet all the worthy vertues so transparent, And so well knowne to be in him inharent, Could not perswade the Papists leaue their strife, With cursed treasons to attempt his life, For when their disputations helpt them not. They would dispute in a damn'd powder plot. In which the Romists went beyond the deuill, For Hell could not inuent a plot so euill. But he that plac'd him on his royall Throne, The God of Jacob, Judahs holy one) That God (for Iesus sake) I doe beseech, (With humble heart and with vnfained speech) That he or his may Britaines Scepter sway, Till time, the world, and all things passe away. But now he's gone into Eternall blisse, And with Eternall glory crowned is Long may King Charles weare Britaines royall Crowne; And heauens best blessings raise his high Renowne. FJNJS. GODS MANIFOLD MERCIES IN THESE MIRACVLOVS DELIVERANCES of our Church of England, from the yeare 1565 vntill this present, 1630. particularly and briefly Described. When your Children shall aske their Fathers in time to come, What meaneth this Pillar: Then yee shall let your Children know, saying; These Are The Deliveries Which GOD Hath Vovchsafed To His Chvrch In England Since The Beginning Of Qveene ELIZABETHS Raigne To This Day: That all the People of the Earth might know the hand of the Lord that it is mightie, that yee might feare the Lord your God for euer. Ioshva 4. 21, 22. 24. There was a Bull in Rome was long a breeding, Which Bull prou'd little better then a Calfe: Was sent to England for some better feeding, To fatten in his Holinesse behalfe. The vertues that this Beast of Babell had, In thundring manner was to banne and curse: Raile at the Queene, as it were raging mad; Yet God be thanked She was ne're the worse. The goodly Sire of it was Impious Pius. Hee taught it learnedly to curse and banne: And to our faces boldly to defie vs. It madly ouer England quickly ranne: But what successe it had reade more and see, The fruits of it here vnder written be. This Bull did excommunicate and curse the Queene, it deposeth her from her Crowne, it proclaimed her an Hereticke, it cursed all such as loued her, it threatned damnation to all subiects as durst obey her, and it promised the kingdome of heauen to those that would oppose and kill her. This was the effect and nature of this Popish Beast, which all wise, godly, and vnderstanding men did deride and contemne. 1 A Priest call'd Moorton, by the Pope assign'd, Northumberland and Westmerland seduceth: With whom the Dake of Norfolke is combin'd: The whilst the Pope no cost or charge refuseth, But pawnes his Challices, his Beads, and Crosses, Giues them his gracelesse blessing for their ayde: The fruit whereof were heads and honors losses. God still defending Englands Royall Maid. Thus we (by proofe) must thankefully confesse, That where the Pope doth curse, there God doth blesse. 1569. Pius the fitfh of that name, Pope of Rome. Duke of Norfolke, and Earle of Northumberland beheaded, Earle of Westmorland fled. 2 Don Iohn 1578. He was Brother to the King of Spaine, and failing of the hope he had to be Crowned King of Tunis, be practiseth inuade England, wherof failing, he dyes for griefe. of Austria, whom the Pope incites Our Queene and Kingdome both to Captiuate: And whilst he warre prepares with subtill slights, A fained peace he doth capitulate. Nay more, he doth perpetuall peace proclaime, Thereby to make vs sleepe the more secure, But Godsgreat Mercy made him misse his aime, And what he thought most certaine, prou'd vnsure This plot of our Inuasion thus orethrowne, Don Iohns ambition with his life did end. Whereby th'Almighty to the world makes known, That he his Church will euermore defend. His Vine she is, his power doth guard her round, And all her Enemies he will confound. 3 Romes malice and Spaines practice still concurs, To vexe and trouble blest Elizabeth: With Stukeley they combine to raise new stirs. And Jreland bragging Stukely promiseth To giue vnto the Popes braue Bastard Sonne Iames Boncampagno, an ambitious boy. And Stukely from the Pope a prize hath wonne, A holy Peacocks Taile (a proper toy) But Stukely was in Mauritania slaine, In that great battell at Alcazor fought. Whereby we see his power doth still defend His Church, which on his mercy doth depend. 1578. Pope Gregory and the King of Spaine, Conspire to raise Rebellion in Ireland by meanes of Thomas Stukely an Englishman, who was slaine in the field with three Kings with him. 4 An English Priest call'd Nicholas Saunders next, A consecrated Banner gets from Rome, And like a trayterous wretch mistakes his text, Rebelliously doth into Jreland come, He with the Desmonds ioynes in bloudy manner, And when Iohn Desmond murther did commit, Then by the vertue of his bable banner, Applauded it, and did the crime remit. This good successe Romes sweet proceedings had, The Earle was by a common Souldier kild, And Saunders pinde, ran miserably mad, His conscience with tormenting terrour fild. Thus treason is accordingly rewarded, And still the Church of God by God is guarded. 1579. Iohn Desmond was brother to the Earle of Desmond. Saunders ran mad in the wild Mountains, Woods, and bogs of Ireland, and dyed by famine. 5 Parsons and Campion, a most wicked brace, Of English Traitors Romish Iesuites, Get from the Pope the fauour and the grace To play in England the Jscariothites. Free leaue they from his Holinesse obtaine To draw true Subiects from their loyalty, To make our Kingdome vassall vnto Spaine, And to depose the Queene from Royalty. At last (despight the blessing of the Pope) Their plots were knowne, and qvickely Parsons fled, But Campion dy'd at Tyburne in a Rope, Hang'd all (as 'tis supposed) but the head, God still the practice and the plots orethrowes, Of his most deare beloued Churches foes. 1581. These Iesuites walked in disguise here long before they were taken, sometimes like swaggering Ruffians, sometimes like Ministers, sometimes like Noblemen, sometimes like Souldiers, and sometimes like Aparators. 6 Here Sommeruill an English Gentleman, Seduc'd by Romish Priests the Queene to kill, Attempts it in the desperat'st sort he can, And with a drawne Sword runs her bloud to spill: But by the way, with one or two he met, Who did oppose him and his damn'd intent: Whilst like a mad man he gan rage and fret, At those that did the mischiefe then preuent. But tane he was, and close in Prison pent, There to remaine till Iustice him should trye, And then to haue deserued punishment. That others might example take thereby. But Sommeruill was strangled in the Iayle, Thus God to guard his Church doth neuer faile. 1583. Jt was thought that Sommeruill was strangled by some that set him on worke, for feare least his confession might haue preferred them to the Gallowes. 7 Mendoza here, Ambassador for Spaine, Foule treason with Throckmorton practiseth. To moue sedition, raise a warlike traine, Inuade the Realme, depose Elizabeth, Mendoza is discouered, and disgrac'd, And out of England in disgrace was thrust, Whilst in each hand he hath a Letter plac'd. Which he had got from Traitors most vniust. In one of them was written all the Names Of English Lords, that did the Pope affect. In th'other all the Hauens and the streames, For shipping, and our foes how to direct, But God his Church, our Queene and Realme defended, Throgmorton hang'd and quarter'd, all was ended. 1584. In these dangerous times, the Queenes mertie was very great towards the Priests and Iesuites, for shee commanded that the seueritie of the Law might bee mittigated towards them. 8 The Romish Vipers neuer taking rest Most dangerous Letters traiterously were writ: That foraigne Princes England might molest, The bearer was a Scottish Jesuite, Who by Dutch Pyrates on the Sea was tane: His Letters torne hee ouer boord did fling. But the Winde blowing from the raging Maine, The Papers backe into the Ship did bring, Which thought they were in many peeces rent, Were plac'd together by Sir William Wade, Who found, the Guise, the Pope, and Spaines intent Were strong combined England to inuade. These proiects thus were blasted in their bud, And their pretence of Harme God made our Good. 1585. His name was Creighton, being taken at Sea, he cast his Letters, torne in pieces, into the Sea, for feare of being discouered, but the Winde blew them into the Ship againe. 9 Here William Parry hath got leaue from Rome, To broach new mischiefes on our English shore, And he to kill Elizabeth doth come, Though shee his life had pardon'd long before. His Absolution from the Pope doth show That ere the murders done it is forgiuen: Nay more, his Holinesse doth free bestow Vpon the Traitor endlesse Ioyes of Heauen. False Parry with his Dagger purposely Went to the Queene in dutious sort dissembling, When with her lookes of awfull Maiestie, She strucke the villaine full of feare and trembling. Then was he tooke and hang'd as he deseru'd, And onely God our Church and State preseru'd. 1586. Parry was a Doctor of the Ciuill Law, whom the Queene had pardoned sixe yeares before, for killing of one Hugh Hare, yet afterward by the diuels instigation, and the Popes absolution and encouragement, he fell into this treason, Executed at Westminster. 10 Here Ballard, Sauage, Tichburne, Babington, Gage, Trauerse, Tilney, Windsor, Charnock, Dun, Iones, Barnewell, Salisbury and Abington, These fourteene into dangerous treasons run: They would but kill the Queene, subuert the State, Make England beare the yoake of Antichrist: And for those ends they worke both soone and late, Whilst Ignorance to Errour is entis'd, They in Saint Giles his fields their proiects layd. There was the Consultations of their braines: And in those fields they had their wages paid, Handsomly hang'd and quarter'd for their paines. Thus God doth still our Church defend and blesse, And those that are her foes haue ill successe. 1586. This yeare Rowland Yorke and Sir William Stanley turned Traytors. September 13. 11 An English Gentleman William Stafford nam'd, Was by the French Ambassador perswaded, That if hee'd kill the Queene he should be fam'd, For by her death might England be inuaded. Besides, for it the Pope would thankfull be, And all the house of Guise, should be his friends. But Stafford to their plots did seeme t'agree, Yet told the Councell on his knees their ends. These things vnto th'Ambassador were told, (And Stafford did auouch them to his face:) Which he deny'd audaciously and bold, Much ill beseeming his estate and place. Thus whatsoeuer 'gainst our Church was wrought, God still did bring their purposes to nought. 1587. This Stafford was a Gentleman well descended, his Mother was of the Bed chamber to the Queene, and his Brother Leiger Ambassador in France at the same time. 12 This yeare Spaine with a mighty preparation With twelue score Vessels loadeth Neptunes backe, With thirty thousand men attempts inuasion, Of Englands Kingdome, and Elizaes wracke. Then many a bragging desperate doughty Don, Proud of the strength of that great huge Armado, Went barely off, though they came brauely on, The power of Heauen opposing their brauado. Our numbers vnto theirs inferiour farre, Yet were they tane, sunke, slaine, bang'd, thump'd, &amp; batter'd, Because the Lord of Hosts the God of warre, He was our trust and ayde, our foes he scater'd. His name is ouer all the world most glorious, And through his power his Church is still victorious. 1588 The Spanish fleet were in all of Ships, Galleons, Gallies and Pinaces, 242. of Souldiers, Mariners, and Galley slaues, 31030. of great Ordnance 2630 Our fleet were in all but 112. the Campe at Tilbury were 22000. foot, and 12000. horse. 13 Lopez a Doctor, by descent a Iew, A Portingal by birth, the Queenes Physitian: Forgetting duty, (to his Soueraigne due) Would poyson her to further Spaines ambition. The Spaniards and the Doctor are compacting, How this sweet piece of seruice might be done, They promise gold, and he doth vow the acting, A bargaine wisely made is partly wonne.) But this base Iew is taken in the trap, The Queene preseru'd the Spaniards cake is dough, The Doctor wrong'd his breeches by mishap, And hanging his reward was good enough. Still treasons working, though its lucke be ill, Gods gracious power, his Church defending still. 1589. The Quene has beene gracious and bountifull to this same Lopez many wayes, and hee was accounted a man of good integrity till hee was corrupted by the Pope and Spaniard. At his Araignement feare made him wrong his breeches: he was hanged at Tyburne. 14 Tyrone supported by the Pope and Spaine, Had put our English Kingdome to much cost, Perceiuing all his treasons were in vaine, His dangers desperate, fruitlesse labour lost: Although his Holinesse from Rome had sent, A plume of Phœnix feathers for a blessing, Which bable from Tyrone could not preuent Rewards of lust i[illeg.] for his long transgressing. To the Lord Deputy be doth submit, Craues the Kings mercy, and obtaind the same: Yet afterward he did his faith forget, And new rebellions did in Jreland frame. At last with guilty minde, away he flyes, Thus God confounds his Churches enemies. 1587. Tyrone an Jrish Earle, a man of great power and policie. a most pernicious and dangerous traytor, 1604 hee came vnto England, and was most graciously pardoned by the King, yet afterward would haue let all Ireland in rebellion, but failing of his purpose, fled to Rome 15 Mongst all these dangers Queene Elizabeth, Preserued still, and reigned royally: Defended all her life from violent death, And seauenty yeares of age dy'd naturally: To her succeeded (as his proper right) King James Great Britaines blessed Salomon: When straight began new tricks of Romish spight, For Church and King, and Lands subuersion. Watson &amp; Clarke, two Priests, two Popish brothers, Seduc'd Lords. Cobham, Gray, two Noblemen, Sir Walter Rawleigh, Markham, Brooke, and others, To rake the King, and him in prison pen. The plot's found, Iustice would th'offendors kill, But the Kings mercy sav'd, what Law might spill. 1603. They would haue altered Religion, brought in Forraigne power, imprisoned the King, and raised Arbella, Watson, Clarke, Master George Brooke, executed. The Kings mercy saued the Lord Cobham, Lord Gray, Sir Walter Rawleigh, Sir Griffith Markeham, at the Blocke, as the stroake was readie to bee giuen. 19 Now treason plotted in th'infernall Den, Hels mischiefe master peece began to worke, Assisted by vnnaturall Englishmen, And Iesuites, that within this Land did lurke. These would Saint Peter to Salt-peeter turne, And make our Kingdome caper in the ayre. At one blast, Prince and Peeres and Commons burn, And fill the Land with murder and dispaire, No treason ere might be compar'd to this, Such an escape the Church had nere before: The glory's Gods the victory is his, Not vnto vs, to him be praise therefore. Our Church is his, her foes may vnderstand, That he defends her with his mighty hand. 1605. Percy and Catesby would needs be heads of this treason, and their heads are aduanced for it on the Parliament house: they were killed with powder, being both shot and burnt; and powder was the maine Instrument of their hopes s All the Traytors falling into the Pit which they had prepared for vs. Not any of all these treasons, but eyther the Pope the Spanish King, Priests or Iesuites, had a hand in it. 17 The dangers of a long and tedious way, The perils of the raging Sea and Land, The change of ayre and dyet many a day, And Romes temptations which thou did withstand, And after all thy safe returne againe, (Amongst those blessings make vs much more blest) In mind and body free from Rome and Spaine, For which our thankes to heauen is still exprest, Long mayst thou liue Gods gracious instrument, To propagate his Gospell and his glory, All Antichristian foes to circumuent, And with thy acts to fill a royall story. That after ages truly may repeate, These Deeds were done by Britaines Chales the Great. 1623. Great was the enterprize and hazard of our gracious Prince, but greater was Gods, in guiding and guarding him backe againe to all our Ioy and Comforts. 18 And last of all, with Heart and hands erected, Thy Church doth magnifie thy name O Lord, Thy prouidence preseru'd, thy power protected. Thy planted Vine, according to thy Word. My God what shall I tender vnto thee, For all thy guifts bestow'd on me alwayes? Loue and vnfæined Thankefulnesse shall be, Ascribed for thy Mercies, all my dayes. To thee my Priest, my Prophet, and my King, My Loue my Counsellor, and Comforter, To thee alone, I onely praises sing, For onely thou art my Deliuerer. All Honour, Glory, Power, and Praise therefore, Ascribed be to thee for euermore. The Churches Thankesgiuing to God for all his Mercies and her Deliuerances. The Church of Christ doth acknowledge no other Intercessor, Defender, Maintainer and Deliuerer, but onely Christ himselfe. FJNIS.</field>
