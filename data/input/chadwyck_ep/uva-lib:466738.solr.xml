      <field name="fulltext">?“Futurity! We hail thee safely by the name of grief. He who doth paint our untrod pilgrimage In colours darker than e'en fear hath feigned, Shall be no lying prophet.?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO ALARIC A WATTS, ESQ I hear a voice in this deep hour Of midnight; it is true my friend, That unsubstantial things have power The settled spirit's strength to bend, And to our aspirations lend The mystic key of smiles and tears; A shaken harp—a gust of wind, Can thus unlock within my mind The spells of vanished years. I hear the' inhospitable rain Against the illumined casement beat, With some what like a sense of pain, That the ripe woodbines, young and sweet, Which over-arch this summer seat, Should on insurgent winds be driven, When June, if only for their sake, Should send her fine stars forth to make A blue and brilliant heaven. Perchance it has been ours to view With a like promise, like decay Of powers, that freshly as they hlew, Were worn by pining griefs away. Howe'er it be—whate'er the sway With which my spirit droops, I cast A mournful eye on figures fled, Those apparitions of the dead, The Passions of the Past! Mine were rich visions of the bright And beautiful! sweet thoughts that ran Through many a change, and made Delight In all—the bounteous bride of man; A fascinated eye—whose scan Was fixed in overweening quest On angel-forms that go and come With sympathy, that make their home The enthusiast's virgin breast. The hills—the woods—I trod with awe, I peopled solitude with dreams Of Oread, Dryad, Faun, and saw Naiads by brooks and babbling streams; Whilst solemn and romantic themes, And antique fables, swarmed around By Greek or Tuscan Prophet poured, From lyric strings, and I adored In strong entrancement bound. I gazed within the glass of Hope; I saw her dazzling suns, and laid My hands upon her telescope To grasp the images display'd: It shivered at my touch—betrayed And baffled, from her world I drew; Each wonted impulse lost its force, From sorrow, as a slight resource, To Poesy I flew.— She acts no false dissembler's part, Her accents, merciful and mild, Fall sweet upon the wounded heart, As Beauty's o'er her weaning child. Amid her valleys, green and wild, At summer-eves loose loitering, With daring hand I sought to strip Some flowers that bore a kindredship With day-dreams of my spring. When gathered, they were soon thrown by, The lightly won are lightly lost, And sorrow has a way ward eye That soon forgets what pleased it most. Of what remains I ill can boast; In hours of gloom and mental strife, Thou cam'st across my solitude, (Apollo to a wintry wood) And warmed the leaves to life. These reliques thus, with grateful heart, To thee, dear Alaric, I bring, To whose fine hand the Nine impart The concords of a sweeter string Familiar access to their spring Of starry visions thou canst vaunt; Enough for me if not denied, A chance-brought votary by thy side To tread their hallowed haunt. Woburn, June 23, 1820.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I know of no human composition so affecting as this, nor a history ofdeeper interest: these are the names and actions that ought not to perish.” Note on the Epitaph of Julia Alpinula. Childe Harold. JULIA ALPINULA. “I never heard Of any true affection but 'twas nipt With care, that, like the caterpillar, eats The leaves of the spring's sweetest book, the rose.” Thomas Middleton. I. With rapid wing, in ceaseless flight, Time sweeps along, and leaves in night, Each brilliant aim of life's short span, The joys and agonies of man. The storied arch that Glory rears, He mantles with the moss of years; O'er Beauty's urn in ivy creeps; Shatters the tomb where Valour sleeps; And quenches, ne'er to burn again, The fire in Freedom's awful fane. He sends the beating wind and shower Proudly to battle with the tower, And when in ruin they have rent Frieze, portico, and battlement, With scoffing lip he seems to say, “Weak worm! thou too shalt be as they; “Soon passion's fire, shall leave thine eye; “Ambition fade, and feeling die; “Hope faithless find its splendid trust, “Thy pride claim kindred with the dust, “And nothing more of thee remain, “Than what remembrance views with pain, “A startling Vision, void and vain.” II. As fast and forward flies his car, His ministers the Seasons are; If now he sends the Spring with dew Earth's flowery borders to renew, Summer, with sunbeam and with song, To lead the dance of life along, And viny Autumn's horn to call Guests to his gorgeous festival,— It is but with a smile to gild The ruin which his wrath has willed. Soon tyrant Winter's whirlwinds urge The' assault of earthquake, cloud, and surge; And pestilence and fever's flame Suck up the breath, or fire the frame. The rich sun of delight goes down. In his annihilating frown, And we but add—of things destroyed, One atom to the mighty void. Thus, unregretted, let decay Our mortal reliques roll away, To where the wrecks of ages sleep Unconscious in the' eternal deep; The glorious Soul its power shall mock: Whirled into whiteness round the rock, That pearl of pearls shall issue bright, A gem of love, a drop of light, By Mercy's smile from its abode Drawn to instar the throne of God! Sorrow and trial in all time Assault the spirit to sublime; Even from our very virtues spring Thoughts which the heart with anguish wring; Of one so chastened, one whose love Was such as angels feel above; Of one who, thus by anguish tried, O'er him she could not succour, died,— My lute in pity would essay To frame a melancholy lay, For never yet were wept or told Truths sad as those its strings unfold. III. Time has but touched, not sealed in gloom The turrets of almighty Rome; The same deep stream which tossed of yore The infants in their ark ashore, Whose power, since deified, has piled This seven-hilled city in the wild, Yet in its yellow lustre roves By marble halls and holy groves. Yet on its mount, the pillared shrine August, of Jove Capitoline, Rich with the spoils which war translates, The plunder of a thousand states, Though grey with age or thunder's scars, Looks in proud triumph to the stars, Its portals passed, its thresholds trod, By white-robed Flamens of the God. Ascended by its hundred stairs, The rough Tarpeian yet declares His fate who freed its fane too well, Who vainly watched, and sternly fell. Structures of piety and prayer, Domes, towering over temples, there The busy Forum overlook,— The scene where Junius Brutus shook Fiercely his imprecating sword, And smiled on liberty restored. And here the Rostrum, at whose foot Grief rose to rage, and rage grew mute, As Pity dropt, or Passion flung Honey, or gall from Tully's tongue. There, where the great and glorified On marble pedestals abide, With Gods that make the skies their home, The vast Pantheon's pillared dome Heaves into heaven. With shout and song, As rushing cars urge cars along, There the live Circus hums, and spreads Its gladness o'er ten thousand heads,— Sons of a race once armed with power Omnipotent in danger's day, And still commanding, though their hour Of earlier worth has passed away: Though wronged Camillus wars not now, Nor Cincinnatus leaves his plough, Mutius a tyrants' wrath disarms, Fabricius awes, nor Scipio charms, Nor Regulus his pangs defies, Looks back on Rome, and grandly dies. IV. From infancy a child of guilt, In blood by evil passions spilt, Man lays his own foundations deep, And crime and violence must keep His stormy height, contested power;— His bride Ambition—Strife his dower: By fresh gradations he must win The apotheosis of sin: And Priestcraft comes in slavery's aid Without going far into the subject of the deification of the Cæsars, it may be sufficient to state in proof of the extent to which it was carried, that the glorified Augustus was worshipped as a God, and had a temple erected to him at Lyons. A magnificent altar was consecrated to him, ornamented with sixty pillars, on each of which was graven the name of some conquered city in commemoration of the victory. Three hundred Augurs, and sixty Aruspices were invested with the functions of the worship of the Goddess of Rome and the God Augustus. The first of this new order of priests was one of the principal Eduans. This idolatrous worship extended over all Helvetia. To deify the wretch they made; His evil angel then denies, Or grants him as a curse, the prize. A happier minion soon shall strip That laurelled brow to bind his own, And smile, with satire on his lip, To slay the slayer on his throne. Thence in an hour of darkness hurled, His earthquake-exit rocks the world; So rose in clouds of crime and war, The splendour of the Julian star, And such the shock, which in thy fall, O Galba! strikes, and startles all. An awful gulf was that between; There one red river rolls away To darkness evermore; a scene Dreadful to image and pourtray; As battle, rapine, faction, rage, Revolt and murder shook the age; Defiled in pure Religion's robe, And Peace, if Peace yet lingering near, Sends forth her turtle o'er the globe In promise of a lovelier year,— With far-averted eye bewails Her vines uprooted in the vales, And her fired towns, whose ashes fly To the four quarters of the sky, Whence, scenting from his northern towers Warm, warm Campania's orange bowers, The future Alaric shall sound His trumpet to the Goths around, In mirth, through the triumphal shrines Of Trajan and the Antonines. Abroad where hoary Ocean smiles, Fear fills with fugitives the isles, Flight is security no more, Blood stains the waters and the shore: There is no loved remembrance, none, Of valour fled, and virtue gone; Senates, once awful and adored, Are meek and supple to their lord, And his worst actions glorify With flattering tongue, and quailing eye. V. All, all is changed! age, manhood, youth, The soul of honour, lip of truth; The manners of the ages past, Simple, severe, confiding, chaste, Are told, if told of, with a sneer, Fit only for a Cato's ear; The matron-shade, in which of yore Volumnia charmed, Cornelia grew, Whom Romans loved, who Romans bore, Is fled—almost forgotten too. To sun themselves in public view, Is now the pride of Beauty's daughters, Or at the tesselated bath, To chide in their capricious wrath, The slaves who gather from the waters, And lightly braid with delicate care, The flow of their redundant air. In sweeping vestures they depart, So gently discomposed by art, That it may seem the wind's delight To give the embroidered hues to sight; And when in summer they forsake Their villas by the Lucrine lake, And seek the blue, delicious sky Of Capri or Puteoli, In galleys, golden at the prows, On Syrian couches they recline, The fan of cedar cools their brows, And roses blush round cups of wine, While instruments of silver sound Make glad the waters, dancing round. Discord dethrones, and household wrath, The chaste Penates of the hearth. The charities of kindred fly Like old Astrea to the sky. By home-bred faction, slave or son, Each high-born Lady is undone; Those whom their pride has piqued, with hate On them have wreaked a harsher fate, And they whom no accusing foe Impleads, have friends to deal the blow. VI. Some there are yet who wear, unawed, Nor slavery's chain, nor murder's sword; Whose hearts, like harps, have brilliant tones, If feeling touch, or valour waken, The sweetnesses an angel owns, In life devoted, death unshaken. But when beneath a despot lord Crime, like a giant walks abroad, Law's fruitless fences trampling down, To seize on Power's unstable crown, The hearts that truth and freedom send Her failing fortress to defend, Strive against fate a little while, Then sink with a despairing smile, To ruin with the ruined pile Whilst Love—the daughter, or the bride, Who clung in life to Valour's side, Survives, as thought and feeling cast Their lovely blossoms on the past, O'er memories of a former day, To bleed a broken heart away. Like a young vine, whose tendrils lone Embrace some hero's funeral stone: Fixed in a fatal soil, it pines, Even whilst the season sweetest shines; In vain the wind, the sun, the dew, Its weeping beauty would renew; Faithful to death, its leaf defies The light of suns, and balm of skies; The lively colours are defaced; The boughs run verdantly to waste; Every day more faint and frail, It wears in the caressing gale; Hour by hour the wan leaves strewing, Hour by hour it hastes to ruin; And soon its little life is spent Upon the warlike monument. VII. In far Helvetia's mountain land,— Realm of the torrent and the pine,— Aventicum's proud turrets stand, Where lake Moratium's waters shine. Ere Cæsar yet had overrun The climes that front the setting sun, In full defiance of his power, This splendid City sent its flower,— A high, severe, heroic race Who scorned their narrow dwelling place,— Their seats in lovelier lands to fix, Beneath the proud Orgetorix. In dazzling arms that braved the sky, Rushed forth her Alpine chivalry, Led onward by the eagle's screams O'er snowy Jura's sky-born streams. The sullen Arar groaning, roars Tormented by their thousand oars; But, swiftly-footed as the wind, The deadly Roman hung behind, And, leagued with the tempestuous Gaul, Repelled them from Bibracte's wall. Her bravest slain, her spirit broke, She bowed her proud neck to the yoke: Then Roman rites, and Roman rods, Scourged from their shrines, her Celtic Gods; New priests were given, new temples rose, Glittering amid her Alpine snows. Those virgin snows Diana loved, The mountain's misty paths she roved, Rousing with her sonorous horn The chamois from its couch at morn: To her a splendid fane was raised, The altar smoked, the incense blazed, And mystic hymns were framed, of skill To charm her from the Aventine hill, Then rose in light her vexing planet; Then shook the eternal hills of granite; The tutelary Goddess came, And gave the town its Roman name. VIII. Though thus her ancient pride was quell'd, Successive Cæsars lightly held The golden chains she wore, and Time Beheld her spirit still sublime Amid her mountains, far apart From monarchy, she heard the roar Of storms that shook its mighty heart, But felt, herself, the shock no more. When steady Galba plann'd the doom Of Nero, bloody wolf of Rome, A native Chief with just applause Guarded her liberties and laws: Julius Alpinus had bewailed The sufferings of the state, and hailed Galba who hushed its fierce alarms, With ready faith and open arms. Freedom, and fire, and sovereignty, Were sphered in his majestic eye; Simplicity of soul, the thirst That fired the early Romans' veins, That stir of thousand hearts which burst With passion at the name of chains; And the high worth of better days, Which wreathes the head with glory's rays, But which in times of evil gloom, Herald the hero to the tomb. One only daughter charmed away His cares from anxious day to day; For Julia was his life of life, His star of hope in hours of strife, His flower of innocence and love, That drew the sunshine down from Jove. Gazing on her, a smile and sigh Would strive with him, she knew not why. She knew not why—she could not know How bitter thoughts on sweet ones grow, When in the daughter's face, we kiss The mother's charms, those charms which lighted Our young, romantic hearts with bliss. The long caressed, the quickly blighted; When that dear love of early years Lies low, and cannot heed our tears! IX. Pure as the morning's virgin dew Falling upon the vines of spring, In blest seclusion Julia grew, A fairy shape—a spotless thing. Her home she deemed a little heaven; She had heard nought of crime and sorrow, Save in her father's tales at even, And their remembrance had no morrow. Till thoughts maturer fixed a trace Of pensiveness on her sweet face, And then, as to his neck she clung, With curious, fond, familiar tongue, Much would she question of the scar Which his sagacious forehead bore, And of the nodding plumes of war, And why those nodding plumes he wore, Then wonder at the acts of men, And pause, and think, and ask again; But infancy flew lightly on, And the mind took another tone; Now gaily gathering vernal flowers, Now dancing out the summer hours, Now stripping the autumnal vines, And now as winter eve declines, Passing her fairy hand along The lyre, or in Virgilian song, Chanting the verse, so sweet and clear, Which thrills her father's soul to hear. Where Alpine glaciers, rough and rude, Hung in an icy solitude; On lonely hills, beneath the frown Of pines, that bending o'er the steep, Sent their prophetic murmurs down, In inspiration wild and deep; Where some romantic fountain played, Or lake spread out its waters blue, Or valley flowered, or old cascade Dashed down its waters into dew; Erewhile she loved to rove, and made Her soul familiar with the face Sublime of universal Pan; Nor mountain soar'd, nor river ran, But in her pure eye wore the trace Of Godhead, conversant with man. In thunder, night, the wind's wild swells, She heard mysterious oracles, And strained her spirit to the key Of their unearthly minstrelsy. Thus from her infancy, she was A pupil in the school of dreams, A gazer in the magic glass, Wherein the curtained future seems A spectacle, and a survey, Half coloured with the hues of day. X. And she was beautiful! her face Was flushed with an angelic grace; The amorous sun had wooed it too, And touched it with a richer hue; But those who gazed might well declare They could not wish that face more fair. Her locks of hyacinthine brown, O'er the white brow hung loosely down, Contrasting in the shades they throw, With the blue, loving eyes below. And in those eyes there shone a ray, That like a sweet, consuming fire, Thrilled every soul with chaste desire, Yet kept all evil things away. They who but slightly viewed, had said Pride was her intimate, for tall She was—and in her lightest tread Moved like a princess, but of all That seeming loftiness, the key Was an inborn nobility; The spirit's fire, the crowning charm Of a mind exquisitely warm: In whose unsullied leaf was wrought All that was delicate in thought, And beautiful in deed, with these, She sought all living things to please, But most to act a daughter's part Was the Aurora of her heart. So grateful for a kindness! kind Herself in act, and thought, and mind; Tis true, the assurance was not loud, But those who heard might more than guess The resolution deeply vowed; Her fine eyes swam with tenderness, And spoke appeal more eloquent Than words can breathe, or fancy paint. Their passionate orbs such brilliance haunted, As soothed by turns, by turns enchanted; They seemed to chain the gazer's soul As if with an electric link, And most he felt their strong controul, When most their timid glance would shrink. Like sunshine somewhat spent in shade, The smile upon her features played; A glory, bursting half from gloom, So vividly, and yet so swift, We cannot fix its transient bloom, For pleasure's, or for sorrow's gift, But deem it heaven's own Cherubin, Lighting the lamp of soul within. From little less can rise the trance Of spirit glowing to embrace Celestial presences, the glance Which looks abroad through time and space For one to whom the heart's young glow Of early love may overflow; Such glance as Julia loved to cast, When childhood's rosy hours were past. XI. Calm flew those pleasant hours along; And when with dance, and festal song, She came in meekness to resign Youth's girdle at Diana's shrine, For woman's high and sacred Zone, Whose clasp, thenceforth, of whitest pearl, Should temper with reserve, the tone And fearless frankness of the girl, Much she admired her statue, much The stone no mortal's hand might touch; The horns which cast a lunar glow O'er forehead, chaste as driven snow; The lips which breathed of bashfulness, And that full, uninsculptured eye, By Genius' most divine excess, Fixed in the Vision of Virginity: And though at times her pulse began With new imaginings to stir, As if a flood of music ran Warm through the enthusiast worshipper, She there remained before the shrine, To offer to the Power Divine, That vow which placed her foot within The ambrosial pale that shuts out sin, And gave Diana so to win, In her, the loveliest votarist That e'er her marble image kissed. XII. The fillets of the Goddess shading Her tresses of the simplest braiding, The chastest dews which fountains yield To sprinkle from the silver urn Upon the marble floor, or burn Sweet odours in the fire; to gild The victim's horns; and decorate With branching palm the sacred gate, Was long her lot; and voices sent From vaulted roof and firmament, Upon her ear in whispers stealing, The Numen's tutelage revealing, Would seem to say her life should shine Of the dark Sisters' whitest twine, And heaven upon its favourite child, Could smile not more than now it smiled. But strong were her affections, moved At each appeal of those she loved, And one so fond, and so beguiling, Ne'er from an unkind world went smiling. 'Twas strange! she was not seen to reap The flowers or weeds of those that weep; But they to whom she was most dear, Who viewed, when nought of grief was near, The gentle gloom which o'er her cheek Flew, dimming there its roses meek, Who in that voice, which had a tone Of mournful music all its own, Deep, tuneable, and tender, heard The chords of passion early stirred, And oft-times marked her violet eye Burn bright with sensibility,— Saw in those workings less the blow Of beauty, than the birth of woe. They told, I know not what, of years Soon darken'd by misfortune's tears; Of late remembrance o'er a scene Where joy before had often been; Of cankers when the heart had blown; And of the lovely mind o'erthrown, If e'er one jarring discord wrung A soul so delicately strung. Tis ever so! affection feeds Sometimes on flowers, how oft on weeds! The luxury of love, or aught That opens Paradise on thought: Denied, it sickens; gained with cost, Tis gained too late, or briefly lost. When at life's fount the golden bowl Is broken as the waters roll, Though bright without it, sunshine flies, Within, an awful shadow lies. Around, it bears some sculptured name, One frenzied word, engraved in flame. Whilst the pure springs in freshness bound Upon the fragments scattered round, Thro' ruin still exists that token, Tho' fate the cup has broken, broken! XIII. It came at last, a fearful time, Dark with despair, and mad with crime; A time of terror and of fate To free Helvetia's mountain state. When grief no private pang could feel, In sorrow for the public weal; When the bright past appeared a blot Which apathy remembered not; When the wild present was the slave Of chance, and tears became the brave; And all beyond—a deluge dark, But O, without Deucalion's ark! With many an omen, passing faith, Rushed in the flood of war and death; Bathed in the sweat of agony Were statues seen, and voices ran Shrill through the streets, a hollow cry. Unlike the cry of mortal man. Victory her brandished arms let fall. At noon in the pale Capitol. From Juno's shrine rose angry forms, Striding the winds, arrayed in storms, And vanished with a sound more loud Than thunder in a groaning cloud. Night's planet wore the dark eclipse, Earth shook its towns; the seas their ships; Trees fell from hills, whilst on the wood A summer calmness seemed to brood. Floods swept the streets by day; at night Came startling visions of affright To priests in their divining cell, Which they in terror dared not tell. As silent thro' the squares they passed, Their eyes upon the pavement cast, Ill could the anxious people brook The ghastly anguish of their look. All faces gathered paleness: Rome Seemed compassed by the day of doom, Since on the foreheads of the just Sate mortal sadness and mistrust. The oracles no more dissembled, The Priestess on her tripod trembled. Fatal night, and angry morning, She chanted forth her wild forewarning, Evil dreamt and treason dawning; Beckoning shapes that led to ruin, Armed hand the head pursuing, Deeds, of which there's no undoing, And the red waves of Phlegethon In fire for ever rolling on. At length when every eye was bent To vision forth the dark event, The awful secret of the fates Burst from their adamantine gates, The bloody dagger struck too well, And Otho rose as Galba fell. “Under the government of Nero, the discontent of the people, oppressed by taxes, their contempt, their hatred of the worthless emperor, excited a mighty insurrection in the Helvetian provinces. Julius Vindex, of an illustrious Gallic origin, prefect of the province of the Lingones, revolted against the crowned tyrant, and leagued with Galba, the governor of Hispania, esteemed for his probity and attachment to a strict discipline. The German legions imitated his example. The tragical death of Nero, last of the Cæsarian princes, laid open the empire as a prey to the boldest or most fortunate adventurer. Galba was put in possession of it by his soldiery, but them his economy and severity of discipline displeased. They who dispose of crowns, desire a reward proportioned to the splendid gift. Galba had adopted Piso for his successor: the jealous Otho rose against him, and Galba was assassinated, but the usurper did not long enjoy his elevation to the imperial purple. Vitellius, seeing what might be done with the assistance of an army devoted to its chief, caused himself to be proclaimed emperor by the German legions which he commanded. He set out with them to receive the homage of Rome, Aulus or Alienus Ceeina, one of his generals, preceding him with 30,000 men, and traversing Helvetia. The Helvetians were ignorant of the death of Galba, whose cause they had embraced, and refused to recognise Vitellius. Their chief magistrate, Julius Alpinus, Or Alpinulus. a faithful friend of Galba, confirmed them in their resolution, and engaged them to take up arms.” —Mallet.—Histoire des Suisses, 4 tom. 8vo. Geneve, 1803. But long before this deed of fear Could reach the far Helvetian's ear, The sullen legions of the West, Had reared the banner and the crest, And taught their Eagles to take wing Before a Camp-elected King. To the first ranks Cecina sprung, Savage, though brave; though ruthless, young; Found false by Galba, he had long His own abasement deemed a wrong, And now beheld in civil change A fit arena for revenge. For this, that murdered Prince's fall His subtle mind concealed from all; Thus he made ignorance their guilt, And vengeance soothed by anguish spilt. The strength of legions at command, And Battle's clarion in his hand, His foot on Gaul—his lowering eye Turned towards sunbright Italy, The snows on Jura's soaring crest, His terrible regards arrest, His busy Demon whispered there A glorious victim for his snare; He heard, and forward as he flew, The loud, rebelling trumpet blew. Its barbarous clangor seemed to call Bellona from her Thracian hall, And rouse Helvetia to the fears— The pangs of long forgotten years. Young Julia, as the clarion spoke, From all her dreams of joy awoke, To trace through anguish and alarm, A father's sword—a patriot's arm. XIV. To him when first the message came, “Cecina wraps our roofs in flame;” The heart's blood in its deep abode, In boiling eddy ebbed and flowed. But when that ecstacy abates, He calls the Synod of the States; Thermopylæ's sepulchred Greeks Are with his spirit as he speaks. “Princedoms and powers! from ruined domes, The wind bears ashes to our homes; An Anarch comes with fire and sword, By right unchecked, by guilt unawed, And we, his haughty yoke beneath, Must thank him for the bliss to breathe. Not calmly thus in tower and town With wrongs your fathers settled down; They had a blade—once bared, aside The sheath was cast in Arar's tide. From this first deed of lawless power, I see descend a darker hour: “The scenes which marked in Gaul his track Of cities razed, of valleys black, To our dear hills he will transfer— Fortress no more, but sepulchre? But if to us high heaven designs The fall of towers, and blight of vines, These are but wasted, those o'erthrown, When what we dare to do is done; And if we leave the deed unwrought, We perish; not as freemen ought, In glorious token of the vow We took to Galba e'en but now. Of policy I will not talk, The hollow statesman's crooked walk; But yet, methinks, an emperor crowned In Empire's heart, on Glory's ground, Is nobler lord than they who clasp Our country's treasure in their grasp: The first act of hostility between the army of Vitellius and the Helvetians was perpetrated by the 21st Legion, surnamed the Rapacious, then stationed at Vindomissa, the modern Windish. They forcibly seized as plunder, the money which the Helvetians were sending to pay the garrison of a fort, which Cæsar, on his conquest of the country, had privilaged them to maintain with their own militia.—Vide Tacilus, Hist. Lib 1. cap 67. Spirits tempestuous, fierce, and wild, From every brighter hope exiled; Who, nourished in intestine strife, Bear treason's flag, and murder's knife. But I, whate'er may be your lot, In chains will never, never rot, Nor sink in shame: a noble mass Will pour through every Alpine pass If but one hero slip the word; There's brightness on my single sword, To keep its keen edge free from rust, And light our Fathers from the dust.” XV. Slowly the voice of freedom rolls To quicken life in vulgar souls; The Chief may lead to glory's brink, The feeble turn—the timid shrink,— And if he dares the leap, and dies, The crowd but point to where he lies, And to their wondering children tell How freedom's martyr did, and fell. Alpinus' speech the rest received In dumb despair; they heard, and grieved: The foe was long inured to dare The fiercest accidents of war, But when, with all a patriot's pride, He told of them, the glorified, In each grey forest, cave and hill, By prince and peasant worshipped still, A sullen hum like waves that roar Afar, ere yet they break ashore, From lip to lip crept murmuring on, In the choaked whirlwind's under-tone, Till one loud shout of rapture fills The hall, and rolls along their hills. Many, to whom the chief was dear, Made vow and promise all sincere; And some there were, whose envy paid Dissembled praises long delayed. These were most courtly of the crowd, Their praise was long, their flattery loud, They gave assurance to his fame, In public, smiles; in private, blame; “His was too stoical a brow, “He could not bend, he would not bow.” They masked beneath the patriot's name, Their hollow faith, and secret aim, Till Séverus was given to lead The battle's ranks to danger's deed, Tacitus. Hist. Lib 1. cap.68. XVI. Like wings through towered Aventicum It flies, and all the slumbrous hum And idleness of noon, which late Reigned wide from city gate to gate, Is changed at once to deep debate; To tumult, fierceness, and that strife, Whose action is the scorn of life. The peasant leaves his steers afield, To burnish up the spear and shield; The warrior leads his horse from stall, To see how well his fiery hoof The prance of battle can recal, In proud expectance of its proof; The reveller, since the shout is up, Scorns the loose dalliance of the cup, And, trampling on that rose, whose bloom Furnished his garland—takes the plume, And from the armoury demands A worthier weapon for his hands; And as the brazen trumpet flings Bright images of future things, Groves tremble, temples shake around, And vacant theatres resound. The hum the shout that echoing grew, Till shore and sky seemed shouting too,— The stir of crowds—the beating breath Which dark communion claims with death,— The change of mighty passions, driven By freedom's moon, though dark in heaven, Hope, anger, hatred, pride, despair, Like billows are conflicting there, And tell of nerves and sinnews, screw'd To every torture of the feud. With all Alpinus mixed,—the soul, The' informing spark which warmed the whole; His glance looked lightning, and the throng Grew silent as he passed along; The brave as near the patriot came, Caught a new ardour from his flame; The wondering coward lost his stare, Felt not the bristling of his hair, And watched not now, with wavering mind, The shadow which he cast behind. XVII. The fiery sun has given at last His unit to the periods past. His glorious orb, beyond the hill Of far, blue pines, grew dark, but still On the lake's bosom, wave on wave Seemed rubies in the light it gave. “When the sun descends beyond Mount Jura on a summer evening, the Alpine summits long reflect the ruddy splendour, and the lakes for near an hour assume the appearance of burnished gold.”—Pinkerton.—vol 1. p. 405. So a friend of mine writes in his Journal: “In the course of our ride, we had a view of part of the lake of Neufchatel and Morat, on the latter of which the setting sun was diffusing the most glorious hues of crimson light. The waters of the Morat run very dark, and exhibit a singularly beautiful appearance, when penetrated by the deep rays of a declining sun.” The country around the lake is said to have been named, at one period, Galilee. Murat: (Thes. 1102) mentions a circumstance that may perhaps explain a fact so singular. “Vespasian strengthened Aventicum by a colony of veterans.” This colony probably consisted of some of the legionaries whom Titus had brought back from Asia, after the overthrow of Jerusalem; and the similiarity of the lakes of Morat and Neufchatel with those of Merom and Genesareth, connected in both instances by a river, might strike their fancy not unpleasingly with the recollection of their toils and triumphs in Judæa. So we find Helenus in the city of Buthrotus perpetuating the melancholy remembrance of subverted Troy. “Procedo, et parvam Trojam, simulataque magnis Pergama, et arentem Xanthi cognomine rivum, Agnosco, Scææque amplector limina portæ.” Virgil. En. Lib. 3. line 347. Long might you view its rays escape The veil descending twilight drew; Long from the heaven's red curtains flew A colour, making bright the shape, And attitude of things; the grape, Hanging in delicate festoons Round Western windows of saloons, Looked gem-like, fit to blush or burn In Bacchus' bowl or Hebe's urn. But now, O, now! no warrior's soul May melt that pearl in Beauty's bowl, And laurels, not the ivy now Be snatched to wreathe Alpinus' brow. He marked eve's latest radiant streak Suburban wall and Alpine peak; He marked with sighs the creeping shade From structure on to structure stealing; But this might be for night delayed, Or from that deep and tenderer feeling Which Wisdom to her prophet yields, Who takes her book, and breaks its seals: The thought, how soon may thousands reap The soundness of a soldier's sleep, And life to them be like the ray He mourned,—a sunbeam passed away, A glory gathered in decay,— A yesterday without a morrow,— A night that knows no morn of sorrow, Save in some young survivor's brain Who never more shall smile again. He starts—why should a warrior start? 'Tis Nature in a father's heart. He saw far off the sacred pine, Which, watered by his Julia's hands Would grow though sun's refused to shine,— There—dark and statue-like it stands, The loveliest tree in all his bowers, Admired by him in calmer hours; But now he can not, can not brook Thereto to turn, thereon to look. It spoke of all that's blest and pure; Of happiness that cannot last; Of hope, but hope may not endure; And peace, but peace itself is past. It spoke of a deserted claim, It seemed to whisper Julia's name. And must he leave that floor, where first Her footsteps ran, her charms were nursed? Leave the sweet tendril which entwined With each emotion of his mind? How could he see his daughter's face, How meet her mournful, mute appeal. And in her long and last embrace, And in her voiceless anguish, trace All that himself must shortly feel, And in her desolate farewell See the despair she will not tell. Oh why should hearts no fears can shake, With softer feelings bend or break! He wanders wide,—he lingers late, Pausing, he treads the longest way, Then, all impatient of delay. With swift stride intercepts his fate; He stands within the Ionic gate— The gate—the marble hall—alas, That e'er that hall he must repass! —She sate, her pale cheek on her hand; Each drooping eyelash wet with grieving; She heard his step—she saw him stand— Nor could resolve her mind's misgiving; As wilder grew her bosom's heaving, She raised her blue eye from the floor,— In him there was no sign of strife, And steadfastly her glance he bore: That stoical resolve could tell To her the dreaded truth too well; She did not rise—she did not speak She uttered voice, nor groan, nor shriek, But low in virgin meekness bowed, And Nature's daughter wept aloud! XVIII. Morn on the mountains! O, how sweet To catch the first, romantic flow Of rays that, beautiful and fleet, Come down to light this world of woe! When the morn's whitest, earliest flush Flew from the morrow's gates of pearl, Rose Julia; if she saw the blush Of skies, and heard the cataract hurl Its clear, glad waves down vallies nigh, It was with sorrow's ear and eye; That deep misanthrophy of will, Serene, but gloomy; stern, though still; Which recks not of sweet sound or sight, But turns to darkness all delight. A melancholy figure came To her high couch as still she slept, It bore a maiden's faded frame, It bore the face of one who wept. By the dim crescent on her crown, Loose, glistening hair, and purple gown, The bow and sandals dripping dew, Her Goddess of the Shades she knew; Who stood her midnight bed before With finger beckoning evermore; Thrice sighed; presaged a deed of dread; Then fast, with face averted, fled. Julia awoke: a darkening veil That instant neared her planet pale; The next, that orb so beautiful, Was billowy vapour, grey and dull. And well from that transfiguring sign Could she her future doom divine, But heavenly spirits never slight Devoted prayer and pious rite, Nor failed her duteous feet to tread The temple of the Triune maid, With orison and holy hymn, Whilst morn on Jura yet was dim. XIX. The timbrels ring; the doors, unfolding In music on the silver hinge, Alpinus comes, not now beholding, Wrapt in a robe of sablest tinge, Those sculptured walls where Niobe In marble mourns her guilt away. From her lost fate he could not borrow One deeper sentiment of sorrow. He comes with wisely-guarded lips, Lest inauspicious words eclipse The brightness of the fires divine, Thus onward to the holy shrine, Where, in her robes pontifical, Loose locks—a purple flower in all, And silver censer in her hands, Serene the priestess-daughter stands, Now thrice to east, to west she turns, Then bids her handmaids bring the urns. Ten virgins, the lit shrine around, Move, without shadow, without sound. Some sprinkle coldest dews abroad; One brings the sacrificial sword, And in Aventia's guardian name Strews salt and incense on the flame. Pity and awe all hearts pervade, As, kneeling low, the holy maid, Her white arms on her heaving breast, The pure Divinity addressed. 1. Virgin fair! Who under piny shadows rovest, Hearing the tasseled horn in caves unlock The sprightly echo which thou lovest;— If in happy childhood ere I made my haunts the sunless rock, Playing with the springs which well, Whispering forth thine oracle; By my dedicated zone. And a mother's love unknown; By each vow that did transfer That dear name to thee from her; By thine own Latona's love, Listen, Goddess of the grove! 2. Holy Queen! Gladdener of heaven, and earth, and ocean, Whose unveiled face the Egyptian nightly eyes, And Syrian, fixt in deep devotion, On his palmy hills serene, Isis, or Astarte, rise! By thy sceptre, bow, and flames, Hecate of a hundred names! Or what other name soe'er Best may suit thy saintly ear; Thou in whose immortal quest Purest hearts look loveliest; Virgin! to a virgin's cry, Listen, Lady of the sky! 3. Sister twin! Reflex of the God of glory, Whose shield is safety, and whose lyre is life, Sounding heroes deeds in story, Lo, thy sanctuary within, A father arming for the strife! Let thine accents blandishing, Lady, rule the Lycian string; Let round him, in battle's hour, Egis blaze, and arrows pour! So may fires eternal shine Round thy consecrated shrine; Duly every night and morn, Dulcet honey dew thy horn: Sacred Sister of the brave! In heaven or hell, by grove or wave, Virgin Goddess! hear and save. XX. A beam of glory as she rose, Bright as the sunrise upon snows, Was seen to light her iris first, Then round her lips in brilliance burst. Near to the altar's fire she drew, And in her sweetest incense threw. The precious offering slumbered not, But in an odorous column shot To the high dome aloft, and thence Returned in clouds of redolence. Shook the lit statue; and a blaze Which even celestial eyes might daze, In starry coronal adorns The awful head, and lunar horns. One moment burned the unruffled light,— Wavered—and all again was night. With chanted hymn the sacred hind, Stainless as snow, and fleet as wind, From dallying with the flowers that bound, Chain-like, her beauteous frontal round, Led to the altar, strives to fly And fills the temple with her cry. And as the appointed virgin brings The silver sword, aloft was heard The clangour of resounding wings, And lo! within, the Thunderer's bird Shot, and his broad brown pinions spread Darkly around the victim's head; Then, as the crashing ram breaks down The walls of a beleaguered town, Buried in brains the enormous beak; Oh! it was terrible to hear The tortured animal's strong shriek Of passion, agony, and fear, Becoming momently more weak.— It strove, but vainly strove, to free Its eyes from the bewildering wing; A struggle yet—it may not be! It lies a lifeless, bloody thing, And the fierce bird abroad has fled, With eye more wild, and talons red. All stood astonished and aghast! But when its evil plumes were passed, There stole along the pillared fane An unimaginable strain: At once so musical and holy, So sweet, so sad, so melancholy, The fatal pæan touched and stirred To instant sorrow all who heard; That none, when hushed its dirge of grief, But felt in silence some relief; Yet, though the sound was fraught with pain, Wished for its ravishing voice again. At that prophetic sound and sign, Fear shook the Priestess of the shrine: She knew the God who rules the sky Had given the fateful bird to fly; And, with her waving arm forbade. Renewal of the rites delayed. To the wail of flutes with mourning hearts, The long processional departs. Alone, and with a warrior's pride, Alpinus stands by Julia's side. Each ornament of sacrifice From her disrobed, before her lies: When next her lips essayed to speak, The voice was tremulous and weak. XXI. “Oh yet, my father! for thy life The coming storm of battle shun, Thou seest that Jove forbids the strife, Nor Dian, nor Latona's son, Whate'er their favouring power, can move The fixt allmightiness of Jove. Too well I know the blood that runs Through thy dear veins but ill can brook A scorn upon our warrior sons:— Nay, spare the lightning of thy look. Nor early let thy spirit see The drooping thing I soon shall be! Sad though the accents of my tongue, I would not do thy glory wrong. But who that saw such omens rise From the clear depth of shrines and skies, E'er shunned the slighted sign and lives, Though blest with all that valour gives, To me is given the fearful skill, In planetary hours like this, To read in light the secret will Of destiny—Oh, spare me this! For sable are the shapes I see, And hurried are the shrieks I hear; And those that charge, and those that flee, And those that frown, and those that fear, Are gathered, gathered, gathered near. For shivered upon every hill, The hero's weapons shall be spread, And loud cascade and gushing rill Shall long roll down our darkened dead. As Jura's clouds nor pause nor flag, But sweep alike o'er vale and crag; As from his snows of thousand ages, The loud, blue Rhenus bursts and rages; A chieftain comes, who overwhelms The strengh of Capitols and realms. By the wild waters of this eye, Which ne'er before has wept to any, Oh, meet not thou his battle cry! Brave not his bands, for they are many. My bliss has ever been thy care, When wert thou deaf to Julia's prayer! Upon thy knees, thy neck I hang. No mother lives to share my pang. Why is thy brow so sternly bent? Relent, my father, yet relent! Speak—but one word in tenderness, Speak—in thy fond, indulgent tone; When I am quite companionless, Oh, all alone! Oh, all alone! When Thou, my sire, liest cold and low, No clarion then to break thy sleep, And when the fierce, insulting foe, Passing, points at me as I weep, And cries, “this is the warrior's daughter “Who led his country's sons to slaughter,” Oh! whither then shall Julia rush, To hide the burning tears that gush! The flowers—the mountains—wood, and wave, Thy loved remembrance will recal: I shall but ripen for the grave, Thus lonely, scorned, abandoned all! I never could survive to burn Thy ashes for the silent urn, And shrunk to that dark atom, see My hope, my love, my life in thee:— No! no! I fear, I feel, that first This frame will melt, this heart will burst!” Large, brilliant tears her voice impeded, More strongly, tenderly, they pleaded. That sight Alpinus could not brook; He lost the firmness of his look; And all to tenderness resigned, Shook like a reed before the wind: Groaning, he held his robe to hide The gathering anguish as it grew, “My dear, dear child! though all beside Forsake thee, and thy father too,— Thy prayers, thy piety, thy love Will call a saviour from above To guard thy sire, to calm thy fears; Weep not! I cannot bear thy tears. Our country! in that sacred word A thousand oracles are heard; Hers—I am hers—but still to thee All that her son should dare to be.” Low at the altar, faint and pale As she, whose senses flit or fail, He knelt: “this maid in life and death “To thee, Diana, I bequeath:” In all the martyrdom of woe He gained the dreaded portico; Thence flung, with feeling overwrought, One look—of love surpassing thought: She smiled—that dreadful smile had more Of bitterness than all before. XXII. When by some loved one left, we brood In sorrow's peopled solitude, On every dear, remembered token, The tear last shed, the word last spoken; When turning to the far off clime He roves, we feel a mood sublime, Still, meditative tender, deep, Too sad to smile, too blest to weep, Passive the intellectual Mind As an Eolian harp, inclined To be in glorious music kissed By heaven's free breezes as they list,— Awful as angels from their homes The spirit of the Absent comes, Bringing its temper and its tone To touch, to soothe, or shade our own. If gladness warms, we feel the glow; If anguish strikes, we share the blow; Should terror reign, or danger lower, The dark dominion has its hour. We know not why, but yet we grieve, It is not fancy's dream we weave, For we would willingly forego That prescient sense of coming woe, That night-mare of a mind awake Which aches, and cannot cease to ache. Ah no! we feel 'tis truth that rolls Those prophet-shadows o'er our souls; And soon, too soon! does Time unveil The fatal proof that turns us pale. 'Tis the quick sympathy which binds, Congenial hearts, commingling minds; Love's second-sight, unsealed to such As feel his immaterial touch; Link of the chain which shall unite The souls of all whose Love is Light, When purified by every tear Which washed the stains that dimmed us here, We speak, we commune, we embrace, Not needing sound, unchecked by space. XXIII. Such prescience of misfortune fell On Julia in her temple cell. In every tear, in every sigh, She knew the hour of trial nigh, Feared, wavered, trembled, hoped, but still Terror rose potent over will, And hope grew like that burning streak, The death-spot on Consumption's cheek; Till certainty of woe delayed Threw o'er her heart its icy shade, And on her face the marble air Of mute, but palpable despair, Calm of more terrible potent Than Frenzy's loud abandonment. The one is as a storm from heaven O'er lake Moratium's waves and pines, When once with them the gust has striven, It sinks—the lake in silver shines, And heaven again on wave and grove Looks forth in gentleness and love: But that is like the Asphaltine lake, The slumber of whose waveless glass No storm can move, no thunder shake, It lies a deep, unsparkling mass, In its eternity of rest, Dark, cheerless, barren, and unblest. Yes! though a little longer spared The stroke which Destiny prepared, Yes! though uncertain of the blow Which wrought her country's overthrow, Thy heights, Vocetius, witness bore The blow was struck, the struggle o'er. Upon that mountain's mossy head, A tragic spectacle was spread; In front by stern Cecina pressed, The Rhetian phalanx in their rear, They struck, they fell, and many a breast Resigned its high ambition here. XXIV. The thunder has its lull from riot, The morning storm its evening quiet; The raving and rebellious Ocean, Its crystal calm, its rest from motion; The avalanche its silence, when That thundering ball has rocked the glen; For the following splendid and sublime description of Montblanc and the descent of an avalanche, written amidst the Alpine scenes where it was witnessed, I am indebted to the kindness of the friend, whose name has already graced this volume. The spirited stanzas themselves will be my best apology for their introduction in this place:'Tis Night,—and Silence with unmoving wings Broods o'er the sleeping waters;—not a sound Breaks its most breathless hush;—the sweet moon flings Her pallid lustre on the hills around, Turning the snows and ices that have crowned— Since Chaos reigned—each vast and searchless height To beryl, pearl, and silver;—whilst profound, In the still waveless lake reflected bright, And girt with arrowy rays, rests her full orb of light. The' eternal mountains momently are peering Through the blue clouds that mantle them,—on high Their glittering crests majestically rearing, More like to children of the infinite sky Than of the dædal earth:—triumphantly,— Prince of the whirlwind—monarch of the scene— Mightiest where all are mighty;—from the eye Of mortal man half hidden by the screen Of mist that moats his base from Arve's dark, deep ravine, Stands the magnificent Montblanc!—his brow Scarred by ten thousand thunders;—most sublime, Even as though risen from the world below To watch the progress of Decay;—by clime,— Storm—blight—fire—earthquake injured not;—like Time, Stern chronicler of centuries gone by, Doomed by an awful fiat still to climb, Swell, and increase with years incessantly, The mountain, according to Saussure, continually increases in magnitude. Then yield at length to thee, most dread eternity! Hark! there are sounds of tumult and commotion Hurtling in murmurs on the distant air, Like the wild music of a wind-lashed ocean!— They rage, they gather now;—yon valley fair, Still sleeps in moonbright loveliness; but there, Methinks a form of horror I behold With giant stride descending! 'Tis Despair Riding the rushing avalanche, now rolled Form its tall cliff—by whom? what mortal may unfold! Perchance a gale from fervid Italy Startled the air-hung thunderer;—or the tone Breathed from some hunter's horn,—or it may be The echoes of the mountain cataract thrown Amid its voiceful snows, have thus called down The overwhelming ruin on the vale; Howbeit a mystery to man unknown, 'Twas but some heaven-sent power that did prevail, For an inscrutable end its slumbers to assail. Madly it bursts along,—even as a river That gathers strength in its most fierce career; The black and lofty pines a moment quiver Before its breath,—but as it draws more near Crash—and are seen no more!—fleet-footed Fear,— Pale as that white-robed minister of wrath,— In silent wilderment her face doth rear, But, having gazed upon its blight and scathe, Files with the wild Chamois from its death-dooming path! The purple Simoom its light tread When prostrate Caravans lie dead; The earthquake its still under-tone, Its whisper of the murders done. And battle—which in the wide fall Of nations blends the rage of all, Its hush of passions, and the sleep Of energies once strong and deep. The earthquake-shout which shook yon hill Of pines, is over; all is still; Save the cry of the shrill gale, Sad as a shrieking spirit's wail; Save the wild birds' flapping wings, Now fluttering over lifeless things; Save the lone gush of mountain springs; And clamour of cascades that leap Stainless from their aerial steep, But rolling redly from the plain Where lie the Proud and Mighty slain: Rigid and nerveless every hand, That grasped the battle-axe and brand; Pallid each brow; each glazed eye set, But scowling fierce defiance yet; The fiery heart of former years, With all its wishes, hopes, and fears, Its pride—its pain—its might—its mirth— A pulseless ball of wasting earth; The plume and scarf by Beauty woven, Daggled in blood; the helmet cloven; The pennons proud, of yesterday Borne by the gallant and the gay, In life's last agony resigned, Forlornly waving in the wind.— Another's harp may bear away The blazon of that fierce affray, But, Freedom! I will never show Thy dread anatomy of woe. XXV. O War! thou miscreating curse! Dark Juggler of the universe! How hast thou marred this glorious globe! Throwing round thee thy scarlet robe, And masking with the rainbow's blaze Of gemlike beauty thy fierce face; Thou hast deceived from Time's first ages, Its mighty Captains, lords, and sages, Till they and the strong multitude Thy mad, remorseless smiles have wooed; And, drunk with thy bewildering song From horn, or harp, or cymbalon, Done deeds which might the lion shame, And make the nations pale to name. For Priests, their mitres are thy mirth, Thy panders are the kings of earth: From their high Pagods dost thou come Charioted, with the hideous hum Of thousands, who, where'er it reels, Perish beneath thy waggon wheels: When given the groaning death they ask, Thy visage thou dost then unmask, Like the Veiled Fiend of Khorrassan, And on thy wolfish brow we scan The thunder-graven mark of Cain, Heaven's warning impress, stamped in vain; Eyeballs that act the Gorgon's part, A hydra's head, a viper's heart, The penal fire around whose core, Shall redly burn for evermore! XXVI. Heaven's angry Angel pour wrath on thee, War! Ambition and Cruelty harness thy car, And Ruin, and Rapine, and fell Decay, Herald thee on thy blighting way. Thou cancellest Treaty at thy nod, Crumblest the robes of the Priest God; On the palace of kings and the peasant's cot Thou turnest thy visage and they are not; Where thy hurricane hurtles, a capitol burns, And infancy's ashes fill innocent urns. Wrath on thee, War! thou hast given to the tomb Tens of thousands to dread the day of doom; Thou hast fixed on the age that is rolling by, The terrible charm of the rattle-snake's eye; They have come to thy altar with fire and spell To people the chambers of death and hell. Yet royalty smiles, and yet Beauty vows, They crown thee with laurel and myrtle-boughs; And minstrels throng to their hallowed spring, Thy sanctioned homicides to sing; Dealing to nations a frenzied fire, Sorrow to mercy, and shame to the lyre! XXVII. Princess of mountain, flood, and fell! Helvetia! to thy crown—farewell! Weep! for thy patriots hopes are o'er; Weep! for thy freedom is no more; For those who live, and those who sleep In death's cold chains of bondage, weep! 'Tis morn! (how can the morn look gay On the lost field of yesterday?) The clouds which form the sun's pavilion, Are rolled in beautiful vermilion, Nor one faint shape of sadness wear, For all the thousands bleeding there. The ibex comes as it was wont At sunrise to the crystal font, But starts with trembling foot aside In horror of the waters dyed. No human voice or footstep fills The echo of the lonely hills; Nor in the valley's depths, below, Is sound or sight of living foe; But from deep woods the shepherd's eye Sees the grey smoke curl loftily, And there deserted hearths are mute To all but the invader's foot: Their household flames which used to shine Brightly upon bright faces, now But light the torch that fires the vine, And the loved cottage-roof below. With weeping, and the voice of wail, The peasants leave their native vale, And joining those who yet survive The battle, but have ceased to strive, And bearing forward those who lie Weary and wounded down to die, Retreat upon the capitol, And tell the fatal truth to all. By every fierce emotion tossed, Their brave hemmed in, abandoned, lost, We may forgive if the sad City Then sent to move a victor's pity, On whom the passions of the camp Have fixed Misrule's licentious stamp. Whilst many a mother, many a son, Widowed or orphaned, all undone, Hot tears in gloomy anguish shed, Whilst each one shook with grief or dread, What pangs of terror and despair, Had Dian's holy maid to bear? XXVIII. That cruel question ask not now, But gaze on the faint form reclining Within yon pillared portico, Desponding, pale, but unrepining. The virgins round are all in tears, And some in loud lament; but she— Alas! the keenness of her fears Stifles those drops of agony, Leaving alone the sense of pain Busy about her heart and brain. Her mien, though marked by grief intense, Betrays no hurried negligence; The tangles of her auburn hair Are braided with accustomed care; And taste's pure fingers have imprest The foldings of her mourning vest; But yet her eye has lost a glow Of that sweet fire which gladdened so, And each long lash which shades the eye Falls as a black pall awfully, To shut out sunshine from the temple Where joy exists not; her lips tremble As if in agonies and fears With what in her deep soul she hears. Ye guardian Gods! her father doomed! It was as though a trumpet sounded Through the young heart reflection wounded, For quickly then she reassumed Her purpose, to affection sweet, Too sweet for even dread to shun, But all too venturous, all unmeet For her. She, pale afflicted one! Her veil smoothed from the ruffling wind, The scattered ringlets thrown behind, By those, her weeping sisters, tended, The temple's marble steps descended. She passes, in the public path, The Circus and columnar bath; The legendary Pillar, grey With growing mosses of decay; The Amphitheatre, the mount Of pines above the Claudian fount, Then treads the long Moratian way. The awed spectators melt, and bless Her filial love her loveliness; Each had some grief and the kind tone Which pitied hers, relieved his own. The sullen warrior turned aside, The woman in his eyes to hide; The infant smiled through first alarms, And stretched to her its little arms; And beauty sighed as she passed by, And felt a charm in every sigh. XXIX. The armed Impérator of Gaul Sate lordly in the judgment hall. Guarded by lictor, axe, and spear, The glorious criminal was near. Around the crowd, who came to see Their conqueror cursed, or chieftain free. From their indignant lips was sent Nor cry, nor popular lament. The astonished look, and the live ear Catching each sound, alone were here. No lull, no strife; no rest, no riot; But such a blank and awful quiet, As speaks, more strongly than debate, Both mighty dread, and mighty hate. The volume of a people's rage Condensed into one burning page; The coil of a convolving snake, Unhissing, but with folds awake. Then from without was heard to come A whispered sound, a fretful hum, Within the stir of countless heads, And lo! that floor their Priestess treads. The crowd fall back, and hoarsely grow Their accents of controlless woe. Cecina twice essayed to quell The sound, but something like a spell Was felt upon his heart to draw A shade of that remorse and awe Which, in the presence of the Good, By guilt so well is understood. And much he wished, but could not flee The anguish of a daughter's plea. She came—bowed—knelt—yes, even to him! Raising the lovely eyes that swim In hope's wild eagerness, to trace On his stern brow one ray of grace. “Mercy! Oh, mercy!” word beside She uttered not, for the full tide Which long in its deep fount had slept Rushed forth, and then indeed she wept, Oh, how convulsively! XXX. A thrill Of feeling, sorrowful yet sweet, At this pathetic, brief appeal Of Beauty prostrate at his feet, Was seen to chase Cecina's frown And soothe each harsher impulse down: Mute, fascinated as he eyed Affection's triumph over pride, He sate, and passed his hand across His brow, in pity or remorse, In representing Cecina as affected at the supplication of the daughter of his victim, I have perhaps ascribed to him a virtue, which, young as he was, he never could possess. He stands recorded in History “as a man of violence, cruelty, and blood.” Tacitus has painted his character in a few powerful strokes. “Cecina rioted in greater spoil and more blood than Valens. He was naturally tempestuous and fierce; he longed passionately for war, and proceeded always to take vengeance for every offence within his reach, as fast as it was committed, before the offender had time to claim the merit of repentance and submission.” Whilst he held the office of quæstor in Bœtica, he had revolted to Galba, by whom he was afterwards prosecuted for embezzling the public money. Furiously resenting this, he determined “to excite a spirit of universal confusion and revolt, and with the miseries of the state to hide his own private wounds.” Tac. Hist. Lib 1. c. 53. Hence his industrious concealment of the death of Galba, and the unappeasable hatred which he bore to Alpinus. And strove to spare her added pain, The knowledge that the prayer was vain. “Arise,” he said, “young child of woe! “A saviour rise—a daughter go. “Lictors! your axes turn away “From the freed prisoner:”—they obey. He waves his arm the signal known, They guard Alpinus from the throne. Julia upraised her silent eye And looked the joy she could not speak; The purple glow which modesty Lighted in her transparent cheek, Passed by unfelt, so deep her mood Of extacy and gratitude. She turned to see, as in a glass, Her father's face reflect the gladness Of her so happy heart—alas, It was the very soul of sadness! Too well he knew that single crime Which tyrants never can forgive, And scorning in despair sublime The trustless word that bade him live, He paused, and looked as he withdrew, The passion of a last adieu. Resumed his firm, his princely stride, And then, like one all fire and pride Who seeks, not shuns, the approaching doom Which makes his death a martyrdom, He reached the court; he bared his head; The features of each frowning knight He calmly scanned; “and if,” he said, “My country's weal requires it—smite!” They smote; and ere the eager shout Was o'er, which hailed his passing out, Alpinus was a brilliant name, The sealed Impérator of fame; A spirit, o'er whose earthly urn It is almost a sin to mourn; A sire, in whose celestial mind Pain can no answering feeling find, But whose paternal eye yet keeps Its watches o'er a child that weeps. XXXI. But thou, base Consul, Judge unjust, False, smiling Traitor to thy trust! The noble Author of Childe Harold, in his beautiful Stanzas devoted to the fate of Julia in the third Canto of that celebrated Poem, says— “Justice is sworn 'gainst tears, and hers would crave The life she lived in—but the judge was just.” With the latter sentiment I cannot coincide. We have seen that the motives which urged Cecina to take vengeance upon the Helvetians, were founded in private pique—we have seen the folds of his sanguine spirit unveiled to us by the hand of one of the most skilful painters of human character—his concealment of the death of their acknowledged Emperor, has been adverted to— and can we then say that the sentence of him who was at once the accuser, judge, and executioner, was impartial, or avoid perceiving in Alpinus, not the traitor to the majesty of the Roman Law—but the victim to a traitor's guile? Just it might be considered by the decretals of war, whose fierce prerogative it has ever been to dispose of the conquered according as caprice or evil passion has the humour of the hour. Cecina was a Conqueror, and the justice of conquerors resembles too uniformly, I am afraid, that of the Commissioners of Sparta upon the unfortunate Platæans who survived the celebrated siege of their surrendered city. The after history of Cecina furnishes at once a moral to my tale, and a striking instance of retributive punishment. He revolted with his licentious army from Vitellius to Vespasian, when the star of this general was rising in the ascendant, but his army resumed their allegiance, and cast him into irons. They released him, in order to supplicate for them with Antonius. “But as soon,” says Tacitus, “as he approached, arrayed and attended with Lictors, and the robes of state, and passed in the pomp of a Consul, rage seized the conquering host. With his pride they bitterly upbraided him,—with his cruelty; nay, such is the abhorrence naturally annexed to deeds of villainy, that they even upbraided him for his revolt.” Antonius furnished him with a guard, and sent him on to Vespasian. In the Senate at Rome, the fatal sentence was passed upon him—the senators simultaneously declaring their abhorrence “that he who was Consul should thus have betrayed the Commonwealth; he who was general, his emperor; he, upon whom had been lavished riches so vast, and public honours so many, his friend and benefactor.” Tac. Hist. Lib. 3. c. 31. So perished the judge of Julius Alpinus! Thou, who couldst view with eye unwet, A nation's star of glory set, Who given by justice to sustain The fasces of her awful reign, Didst dare her function to pervert, And wring the Roman from thy heart,— The time shall come, when scorned, belied, The fool of perfidy and pride, Thou for thine own vile life shall plead, With none to pity, none to heed; When, bound thyself in iron thongs, And taunted by a thousand tongues, Thou too shall feel of all abhorred, The keenness of a victor's sword. Haste to Bedriacum along! Armed vengeance deems thy loitering long, Her flaming eye is on thy path, To hail the vassal of her wrath. Then—when thy robes so richly gay By ruffian hands are rent away; Then—when the future cannot bring One hope upon its hurrying wing; When drooping, trembling, frenzy-tossed, Ambition wrecked, and honour lost; To fling into thy cup of gall A drop, the bitterest far of all, Shall Memory whisper calm and clear, That word into thy thrilling ear, Shall bid thee of Alpinus think, Seize the dark bowl, and dying, drink! XXXII There is a pang which cannot find An answering language in the mind; There is a woe which only awe With hallowed hand might dare to draw, But feeling all her powers would fail, Lets fall the Grecian Painter's veil. O earth! that thou shouldst ever nurse Thy children to a doom like this! To fear no more, but feel thy curse, Poor bankrupts in deserted bliss! Who cannot yield—though weak and vain All that reflection wrings from pain, One tear, though but of wretchedness, To make despair's convulsion less. The mariner, by ocean's shock Tossed bleeding on its beaten rock, To gaze for ever as it raves On its green solitude of waves, Though not one plank in sight there be, To bear him o'er that shoreless sea, Has hope; the guilty criminal Led sentenced from the judgment-hall, Though in the stupor of his heart, Pale as a statue he depart, Has hope; the fainting wretch who stands Deserted upon desert sands, Where not a single human sound Electrifies the silence round, Has hope; the captive in his tower, Blind to the light, and stripped of power, Has hope; when hope begins to fail, Some late reprieve or passing sail Bears them again with favouring breeze To fortune and to freedom—these Have hope;—the mourner left alone Last of her kindred race has none. No aim to live, no gentle tone To hear, to gain, to give—no, none! No shared caress, no sigh to prove Content in suffering or in love; No friend, to whom her tongue can own That life was once a joy—no, none! All now is over: passions perish, For what has passion left to cherish? The world flows on; suns rise and set Without perception or regret. A little sense of former dread; A little thought of what is dead; A little numbering up the sum Of days that darken ere they come; A sudden flash through memory's night That all her reasonings are not right; A little tracing round and round The spot where anguish struck the wound; A trance—a vigil—and a fit— O'er the cold tomb she cannot quit; And all beside is wasting flame, The bloodless lip, the sleepless frame, So meek, so wan, so passive, death Has nought of stillness to bequeath. XXXIII. Yes, they have come! morn, noon, and night, The starlight rest, the morrow's waking, Nor left for Julia of their flight One record, but a young heart breaking. She seeks, 'tis true, her own-loved bower, And in her ringlets wreathes the flower, That only, which decay though slight Has just, but just begun to blight; And shakes the censer o'er the flame, Pronouncing some half-murmured name. But Oh! the pause when none are nigh, Unconscious that the flower is taken, The deep, involuntary sigh, With which the holy bowl is shaken, All speak a language to the eye, Which cannot, cannot be mistaken. And sometimes she would lean her head Upon the virgins who surrounded, And say there was a dream of dread Which all her waking thoughts confounded, A flitting form of some one dead; She knew not why it so much wounded. But she must gather palm and myrtle, And see her hind, and feed the turtle, Which her dear father's ear each spring Soothes with perpetual murmuring. “My father! wherefore did he go? “It was unkind! the days were many; “He was not wont to leave me so! “Oh, if he e'er be seen by any, “I charge you, by my love, make known “To him that I am all alone!” Then will she gently turn away, And seek the holy shrine to pray, And look with an expectant eye, Abrupt to every passer-by.— XXXIV. Upon her cheek corroding woe No deeper whiteness now can throw; For fever has begun to shed A delicate spot of tender red, Which as it lessened to the view, More strongly set, and brighter grew. It was a tinge of that last flame, Which burns to dust the mortal frame, As sunlight upon mountain-snows Flings all the beauty of the rose, Warm in their whiteness works the ray, And melts the beautiful mass away. The glassy splendour of her eye Already sparkled of the sky; The kindling of a world of bliss, For it was not the light of this. Their heavenly lustre, strongly shining, Sadly contrasted with the chill White lids, which o'er them hung declining, And droop in nerveless langour still, And lightly watch, and deeply close, In passion of a long repose. Through all, her forehead bears the stamp Of a tranquillity sublime, But yet so dewy, cold, and damp, It seems that Death her lovely lamp Would quench before its time. XXXV. The leaf is yellowing on the tree; Glad o'er the blossom hums the bee; The sun declining from his height Sends down to earth a heaven of light, Not sad, though soft—not gay, though glowing; The deep, clear lake has stilled its flowing; The boat, within its waters glassed, Feels not a breath of air blow past; Not one small bird we hear to tune Its bill beneath the mellow noon; But blue-eyed girls of fairy shapes With simple hymns to fill the vallies, As from the vines they pluck the grapes, And press them, purpling Autumn's chalice, And earth below, and sky above, Are full of quiet, full of love. 'Twas in the twilight of that eve, Julia the last time walked abroad; The hue—the hour—the water's heave— And splendid sky her spirit awed. Then brought the sweet south wind to soothe, Warm from the blooms she nursed in youth, A fading breath, a fragrance sere, In funeral of the withered year. It came, it played with odorous wings, Upon her lyre's thrice holy strings, Which oft, when day had ceased to roll, She touched to soothe her father's soul. That odour of decay, that tone Across her languid senses blown, Whispering divinely of the praise, The endearments of departed days, Unlocked, as with a golden key, The long-sealed springs of memory. The air was bliss, the music balm, Her quick heart fluttered at the charm, And she was soothed; her gentle mind All things renewed, recalled, combined, She loved and lived o'er all again, If not with pleasure, not with pain; For pain she felt had lost its sting, Death had no bitterness to bring; Refined from passions earthly shade, O, what was life but bliss delayed! She looked to heaven; the darkening blue Melted into her heart like dew; That heart was happy, and though night Was gathering quickly o'er it, bright, She felt her passing hour was come, And pined for her Elysian home. XXXVI. She rose; she bade her sisters bring The purest waters of the spring For her lavations: from the chest Of cedar took her funeral vest, And the dark veil of death; then crowned With palm the household altar round, Before the portal whereon lay The last rich light of dying day; Paid to Diana the last prayer, And her unbound, luxuriant hair, Severed to virgin Proserpine, Proserpine, or Diana Inferna, presided over the death of mankind, and according to the opinion of the ancients, no one could die, if the Goddess herself, or Atropos her minister, did not cut off one of the locks of the head. From this belief, it was usual to cut off some of the hair of the dying, and to strew it at the portal of the house, as an offering for Proserpine. See the Alcestis of Euripides. The custom was probably derived from the sacrifices, in which it was usual to cut some hairs from the forehead of the victim, and to throw them into the flames: so the dying person was considered as a victim to the infernal powers. With offered cups of sable wine. Worn with the affecting toil, the train Her footsteps tenderly sustain To the sad couch, and watch around, Veiled—without motion, without sound. XXXVII. The lamp at midnight hung untrimmed, The air was hush, the chamber dimmed; Just then the moon on Julia's face Shed a mild ray of gloom and grace. She felt it—half unclosed her eye, And smiled; it was a blissful thing, That her beloved Deity, Should watch her spirit taking wing. “I come,” she whispered, “where are you, “My friends? O, draw the darkening veil! “I go—Elysium swims in view, “Farewell! a dear, a last farewell!” And she is gone: a gentle sigh, Lord Byron, in the stanza already commented on, observes ?“Her heart beneath a claim “Nearest to heaven's, broke o'er a father's grave.” Third Canto, stanza 66. I am not aware of any authority for giving this a literal interpretation. But few writers upon Switzerland have noticed the affecting catastrophe. Briefe uber die Schwitz by Meiner, Berlin, quotes the epitaph, calls Julia a “beautiful young Priestess,” and thinks her death “brought on by excess of grief.” Genave und unstœndliche beschreibung Helvitscher Geschichte, Zuric, by Lauffer, alludes to the circumstance, and says in addition, that she followed her father to the tomb with voiceless grief—the lamentation of silence. Matthisson's Letters to Bonstetten, the friend of Gray, written in German, inform him that “Julia did not long survive the stroke of her father's death, but followed him to the grave in the earilest bloom of life.” He concurs with every one else, as to the touching simplicity of her epitaph. A quivering of the hand she pressed, Faint as the kiss of infancy, Her fluttering spirit fixed in rest. “Farewell!” O, pure, unsullied truth, The sage in years, the bloom of youth, Pain, pity, candour, filial duty, Undying love, angelic beauty, And tenderness in toil untired, In that pathetic word expired! XXXVIII As o'er the lines by others writ, In lettered solitude I sit, Or, turning from their pages, sing Fictitious trifles to the string, Thy tale of truth, to feeling dear, Will rise, and claim her holy tear. I would not thy pure memory stain With aught that breathes of human pain, But in thine own Transalpine clime, view the fragments strewed by Time; His line of ruin stretched o'er all— “The line of confusion and the stones of emptiness” are indeed stretched over the once splendid city of Aventicum. Occasional remains of the exterior wall, the broken shell of the ancient Amphitheatre, and one isolated turret, are all that now remain, but the relics which at various times have been discovered—urns, vases, cornices of columns, altars, inscriptions, baths, ruined aqueducts, bas-reliefs, statues, and tesselated pavements,—all attest its ancient magnificence. The foundation of the City is hid in the night of Time: from the researches of Mons. Wild, Librarian of Berne, it would seem to have been founded 589 years before Christ. It was in the zenith of its splendour during the reign of Vespasian, from 469 to 477. Flavius Sabinus, the father of that prince, came to reside here, bringing with him the riches which he had amassed in Asia. It is probable that the early years of Vespasian were also passed in Aventicum. Tacitus calls it the Capital of Helvetia, and an inscription is yet to be seen in the church of the modern Avenches, which makes mention of it in these terms: Colonnia pia, Flavia constans emerita Aventicum Helvetiorum. It was dismantled by the Alemanni, and Ammianus Marcellinus writes, at the end of the fourth Century—“In the neighbourhood of the Penninian mountain lies Aventicum, now deserted, but whose splendid remains point out its former flourishing state. The circumference of its walls is still to be seen, a solitary pillar stands in the midst of a meadow, like that of the superb temple of Juno at Samos: grass grows in the Amphitheatre, and the plough strikes on statues, altars, tombs, mighty walls, and other traces of ancient opulence.” Agricola, incurvo terram molitus aratro, Exesa inveniet scabrâ rubigine pila: Aut gravibus rastris galeas pulsabit inanes, Grandiaque effossis mirabitur ossa sepulchris. Virg.—Georg 1. 494. Attila overthrew it to its foundation during the following century. Matthisson, who visited it a few years since, observes that the city occupied a large square, the great extent of which is accurately defined by the town-wall, distinguishable in many places. In summer, particularly, if the weather be dry, the streets are still discernible in many places, by the long streaks running in parallel lines, and at right angles, where the grass is scattered very thinly, on account of the little depth of earth over the pavement. Arch, column, altar, crumbling wall, The ruined shrine, the sword in rust, The Urn that held thy virgin dust, The simple legend of thy grief, The pathetic Inscription to the memory of Julia Alpinula, was discovered at Aventicum two centuries ago. Gruter, in his valuable “Inscriptiones Antiq. totius orbis Romani,” has preserved a fac-simile of the tablet and inscription. The latter differs slightly from the one quoted by Lord Byron: it runs thus— AVENTICI.JVLIA. ALPINVLA. HIC. JACBO. INFELICIS. PATRIS. INFELIX. PROLES. DEÆ AVENT. SACERD.EXORARE. PATRIS. NECEM. NON. POTVI. MALE. MORI. IN. FATIS. ILLI. ERAT.VIXI. ANNOS. XXIII. The column spoken of by Ammianus Marcellinus is yet standing. It is of the Corinthian order, 37 feet high, and is seen on the left in a garden very nigh the city on the side of Morat. The fragment of an inscription was found near it in 1536, bearing the name of Vespasian, whence it is probable that the column formed part of a portico erected in honour of that prince. The inhabitants gave it the name of The Storks, from the bird's having been long accustomed to build her nest there. This accidental circumstance gives a hallowed association to that lonely relique, and affords to the moral fancy a beautiful and significant emblem. The Stork sitting upon that solitary Pillar! It is as if the spirit of Julia yet haunted the ruin, that she might still speak to the human heart from forth the shadows of deserted empire— of piety and filial love, as of an indestructible principle, outbraving the eloquent epitaphs of man, and surviving the wreck of his most splendid monuments. And dark o'er them the Ivy-leaf. And can I cease, whilst Spring renews Thy turf with her divinest dews,— Oh, can I cease to keep for thee One tear from selfish sorrow free! No! let the Ivy hide the spot, Thou art not, shalt not be forgot!</field>

Andronicus, the younger brother of John, son of Isaac, and grandson of Alexius Comnenus, is one of the most conspicuous characters of the age; and his genuine adventures might form the subject of a very singular romance.—Andronicus was arrested, and strictly confined in a tower of the palace of Constantinople. —In this prison he was left above twelve years; a most painful restraint, from which the thirst of action and pleasure perpetually urged him to escape. Alone and pensive, he perceived a hole in a corner of the chamber, and gradually widened the passage, till he had explored a dark and deep recess. Into this hole he conveyed himself, and the remains of his provisions, replaced the bricks in their former positions, and erasing with care the footsteps of his retreat. At the hour of the eustomary visit, his guards were amazed with the silence and solitude of the prison, and reported, with shame and fear, his incomprehensible flight. The gates of the palace and city were instantly shut; the strictest orders were dispatched into the provinces, for the recovery of their fugitive; and his wife, on the suspicion of a pious act, was basely imprisoned in the same tower. At the dead of night, she beheld a spectre: she recognised her husband— Gibbon.—Hist. of the Dec. and F. of the Rom. Emp. Chap. XLVIII.

Noon lowers: the winged thunder-cloud O'er Stamboul's towers peals long and loud, Where one lone captive madly strains, In vain, his still-resisting chains, And, through his grated window, eyes The conflict of the seas and skies, Which on the dark horizon meet, And listens to the waves that beat Deep, deep, below the turret's base, As though some Giant heaved his mace, And shook, with an eternal sound, The dungeon-vaults that tremble round. II. What form is that, and whose that look In silent trance to Heaven appealing, His nervous limbs in tremour shook By some convulsive feeling? That wild regard, that frenzied air, Speak long communion with despair!— And mark you well his brow! its frown Would seem to call the thunder down,— The fierce avenger of his fate,— On objects of his scorn and hate. He notes not now the mournful dash Of billows, or the lightning's flash; The keener fire is in his eye, Of shame, revenge, and agony, From which the burning tear would slide And flow, if 'twere not checked by pride, Which firmly steels him to sustain The future, as the past of pain. From Home, Love, Liberty, long riven, He lifts his iron brow to heaven, If heaven will yet in pity give Those boons, or bid him cease to live; Then marks again the mingled mass Of cloud and fire, confusedly pass; Sees, poised above the stormy tide, The wheeling birds of tempest ride, With fixt eye, so intensely bright, And hectic flush of lost delight; As if his very soul would spring To freedom with as wild a wing. III. A bark's below with gilded prow, Which left in calm and sun her haven; But many a rent, Euroclydon Upon her wings, since then, has graven; And she, with not a glimpse of sun Her course, to day, has wildly run:— St. Hermo sits upon her sail, A meteor, appearing in stormy weather upon the shrouds of the ship, named St. Hermo's fire by the Sicilian mariners. Dryden, in his “Song of a Scholar and his Mistress,” introduces the same image. Meteorous, and burneth dim, Like Pride upon the forehead pale Of thunder-smitten seraphim. With bounding prow and bending pine Across the roaring Bosphorus, She yet bears nobly through the brine, As if she ever wrestled thus, And ne'er her pendants gave to fly In crystal bay or purple sky. IV. So near the vessel glided past His turret's oriental wall, Yon Captive hears the active blast Sing in her shrouds, and every call For speed or desultory tack, His hollow chamber echoes back. Two Knights, upon the stern, he sees In silk and steel; their plumes in motion With every breath of every breeze; Their looks are often from the ocean To his hoar rock and grated cell. With them, at least, must pity dwell; For ne'er did blood in hero's veins Flow coolly at a hero's chains! V. The one was past his manhood's bloom: He had a brow of generous sense; An air of not unpleasing gloom, And lips whose lines spake eloquence; And if the searching glance looked long, Within his full saturnian eye,— Which now was tearless,—scorn of wrong, A flashing fire, a feeling strong, Was seen to light its apathy With something of a gay relief,— The Evening-Star of guiltless grief. His cheek, which chesnut tresses fringe, Had somewhat of the Asian tinge; But the short, crooked sword he wore, And crosslet which his shoulder bore, That beam of mind, that nameless grace, Italian-like, which filled his face, Would seem to say, his youth had run In climes where Taste was proud to be, Where only monks and hermits shun The music of a moonlight sea, And brilliant stir of gondolas, By marble halls, o'er tides of glass. The other had a youthful look, And lively; in his iris blue His deepest spirit, as a book, The merest gazer might look through, And see a temper, which if aught Of tenderness came o'er his thought, Would pass to such delicious mood, As in his own Provencal wood, When wine, and wit, and woman's praise, Had made his soul an orb of rays, Inspired the Troubadour to sing— A flower on each romantic string. VI. “'Tis a wild hour,” the elder said, “But rough as was our ocean-path “From Ascutari's craggy head, “And bright as was the lightning's scathe, “On scorched sheet and shrivelled shroud, “There is a head had joyed to brave “The reinless Thunder rolling loud, “The ghastly whiteness of the wave! “Look up and mark the features well “Of him who sitteth in that cell! “And since I see that eye of blue “Is ready with a tear or two, “And since I see your wish would speak “In question of that captive Greek, “List, for I have a tale of crime, “And of a being fallen from bliss, “Which should be told at such a time, “'Tis fit for such an hour as this.” VII. “'Tis twelve years since, upon this shore, “The midnight moon was shining mildly, “A female's shriek, amid the roar “Of dashing waves, rang loudly,—wildly “O'er the blue neptune, and oppressed “A fisher in his dreams of rest, “Who, starting, saw from yonder cove, “Dark forms in hurried action move; “It seemed, that, in severest strife, “They struck for liberty or life, “For many a helm in light was flashing, “And many a sword with sword was clashing, “And frequent cry for aid arose, “From warrior compassed by his foes; “And long, and longer as they strove, “It seemed the Lady of his Love “Rushed in amidst the desperate fray! “Then they were quickly borne away, “And sound and sight were none, beside “The screaming gull and ebbing tide. “At dawning of the day “He sought the spot: a vest, blood-red, “Upon the yellow sands lay spread, “Rent fearfully; a scarf, a mask, “A jewelled ring, a cloven casque; “And none who viewed but must declare, “Some dark departure had been there.” VIII. “Those tokens soon the rising seas “In visitation swept away; “But there was witness sure as these, “Which could not thus decay: “Winter and summer, night and day, “That shriek pealed in the fisher's ears, “And with a spirit's haunting sway, “Made dark his gliding years: “He told to none the tale; the many “Had deemed it idle and untrue, “Or if believed and mourned, could any “The irrevocable deed undo? “Alone in hope that time thereby “Might clear that web of mystery, “He hid within his cottage home, “The embroidered scarf, the mask, and ring;— “That, might a Princess well become, “And this, the finger of a King, “So rich the lustrous gems, which bound “Its figured golden rim around.” IX. “At times when summer's sun had set “Behind far Pindus' purple peak, “Whilst burned his glorious radiance yet “Abroad, o'er Ocean's cheek, “He cast aside his dripping nets, “And winged his boat with sail and oar “To where in smoother current frets “The surge against this shore; “For from those battlements which now “The cypress hides with its dark bough, “Shedding mild mournfulness around, “He heard,—much marvelling,—much divining,— “A lone harp's melancholy sound “Steal o'er the waves, repining; “And once, when Manuel's hand afar “In Hungary lanced the shaft of war, “He heard in yon pomegranate grove, “A woman's accents, sweetly blend, “Saying a thousand things of love, “That could not have an end. “That evening the lone captive sate “Like statue, by his iron grate, “But at the instant that his ear “Caught the fond tones to him so dear, “His spirit melted, and he wept; “The thoughts which long had chilly slept, “Of home's enchantment, beauty, bliss, “Rushed o'er him—all again seemed his! “But when advancing from the shade, “The figure of a Grecian maid, “In grief's wild luxury of charms, “Invoked him with beseeching arms, “Heavens! o'er the features of the man, “A tide of fire and fury ran! “He fiercely stamped,—he fiercely shook “The adamantine bars;—his look “Forgot its softness, and again “Assumed despair, and woe, and pain; “And threats of rage, revenge, and pride, “The twilight breezes wafted wide. “He saw no more:—an armed band “Beneath the turret took their stand, “Whose measured pace at distance fell, “With voice from the set centinel. “With silent oar, resumed in haste, “His vessel's pathway he retraced. “As on it glided far and fast, “Their brokenness of heart recalling, “He could but brood upon the past, “Not check the tear from falling.” X. “It chanced, one eve, when autumn's blast “With cold breath shook the cypress-pine, “From sunny Florence as I passed, “In pilgrimage, to Palestine, “A sail I sought to waft me o'er “These rushing tides to Asia's shore; “But save the fisher, none would brave “The stormy strait and tossing wave, “And we who ventured, well could feel “The firm boat quiver to its keel. “Driven by the wind from creek and bay, “All night upon our oars we lay;— “But when the bells of Istamboul Bells were introduced at Constantinople, according to Ducange, 140 years before this period. The earliest instance found in the Byzantine writers is of the year 1040, but the Venetians assert that they introduced them in that city in the 9th century. “The morn's grey hours began to toll, “With easy impulse we held on “Our cerule way to Chalcedon; “And I, in that light mood begot “By mutuality of lot, “In that wide solitude of ours, “Much questioned of the Imperial powers, “If sought the indignant Turk to wreak “Reprisal on the fiery Greek? “And who led on the Christian ranks “To Taurus' hills and Irmak's banks? “Since Andron, martial prince, was gone “Whither or wherefore known to none; “And years had flown and darker came “Suspicion, whispering Andron's name. “Had jealous Manuel fixed his doom “By poisonous bowl, or dungeon's gloom? “Or roved that Leopard of the war “Wild seas and scorching climes afar? “It seemed my random question brought “Across his brow a sudden thought;— “A sense of something scarce defined;— “A torturing twilight of the mind! “For now the absorbing secret pressed “Like guilt's dark nightmare, at his breast, “And would not, could not be suppressed, “I had so shadowed forth to view “The fears he felt, the truths he knew! “I marked and touched the string of grief “With pity, lenient of relief; “His brow grew brighter; and, more bold, “He left no circumstance untold “Of that wild night which Stamboul's chief “Had deemed unknown or far forgot, “But which from heaven's recording leaf “No time might blight or blot.” XI. “I heard; and cherished in my breast “A secret hope, however vain, “That I might aid a prince opprest, “And burst his grate, and break his chain. “At morn the fisher moored his skiff “Beneath the shelter of a cliff, “Whose far projecting shadow lay “On weedy shelf and brightening bay;— “And there we parted:—lightly shot “His homeward pinnace o'er the brine, “And with a warrior's zeal, I sought “The bannered host of Palestine. “I traced on that romantic shore, “Each spot renowned in song and story; “On high the Red-cross pennon bore, “And reaped, in tears, the due to glory “But never in my heart forgot “The prisoned spirit of this spot. “Years have rolled over years, to me “Of many passions, hopes, and fears; “But to thy cell, Captivity, “Those keen and cankering years “Have come unwished, unwelcomed gone, “Blighted and past, and left but one,— “The' absorbing thought,—the restless aim “Of Liberty's reluming flame.— “To view with an unshackled eye, “This azure amplitude of sky; “O'er ocean's heaving waters bound, “Track with his own Thessalian hound, “The wild-wolf's haunt, with heart as gay “As in youth's seeming yesterday:— “This is a hope that can illume “Long years,—his dungeon's darkest gloom.” XII. “His Lady, fair Eudora, sought “To share his prison, but in vain:— “The kind, considerate Emperor, thought “It would add keenness to his chain.” “She heard, and never would become “The flatterer of his pride, nor hear “Within his court the barbarous drum “Repeat stern vigils to the ear “Of one so fierce, o'er one so dear; “And though endeared by time and truth, “And all the memories of her youth, “Those thousand sweetnesses which grow, “When exiled, into weeds of woe:— “She left the Palace, left the stir “Of princes, and of princes' slaves. “What was a hollow smile to her? “Away then to the woods and waves! “The woods and waves could not impart “Their quiet to her mind and heart; “All beautiful, and stilly sweet, “As are the lines of nature's scrolls:— “They are but so to hearts that beat “In unison; to stormy souls “The bright and still are passionless! “The will's vain thirst they cannot slake “With grasped-at fruit;—their smilingness “But merely adds another ache,— “The sight, without the hope of rest, “To the already-tortured breast. “O say, were birth and beauty born “For tyrant wrong and traitorous scorn? “Were all the generous passions lent “To be our pride and punishment? “Must one so fond and one so brave “Be that a martyr, this a slave?” XIII. “O heaven forbid!” the Youth replied, “And freedom's voice, and knighthood's call! “Cosmo, I left a plighted bride, “Her tears will stain her father's hall, “If fortune cross, or aught delay “Her warrior in his homeward way! “And dear the cause must be, to buy “From me those diamonds of the eye! “At price then of those drops, whose dew “Will wring another's bosom too, “I am thine own, by crag or wave, “To watch or win, to strike or save. “I could not dare to see again “Her Portico of purple vines, “If but dishonour's thought should stain “The star which on my bosom shines: “But doom the arm that perils not “In beauty's quarrel, every vein “That runs with ruddy drops, to rot “Beneath a taunting chain, “And that ignoblest hands should rase “The crest and spur from one so base.” —“Well speaks thy warm and gallant lip; “For this through scorching climes remote “I stemmed the main:—but see our ship “Has anchored, and my Cypriote “For us has launched the tossing boat.” XIV. “Thrice have I circuited these towers “With curious ken, and found at length “A point where time or wintry showers “Have tamed its marble strength, “Where fragments from the weedy wall “Above seem nodding to their fall. “See you not high, in middle air, “Some semblance of a dizzy stair, “Which, sweeping round, is mantled now “By the green alder's clustering bough, “And by the ivy's shade, which shoots “Fearlessly down its wreathed roots? “Thence might we not attempt to scale, “Though high, the' o'erawing battlements, “What time the dark-plumed nightingale “Pours forth its loud laments? “As desperate heights, as steep ascents, “Ere this, have wit and courage won! “Witness that fortress, the defence “Of king Micipsa's Moorish son— “Which rooted on its crag to mock “The thundering ram and tortoise-shock “So high,—it was a dreadful thing “To see the swallow thence take wing!— “Was in an hour of prowess scaled; “The keen Ligurian's craft prevailed:— For the description of this interesting escalade, see Sallust: Bell. Jug. cap. 93, 94. “That lofty precipice he won, “Looked wide o'er tower and pavement lone, “One trumpet blast, the shout, the roar “Of thousands, and its hour was o'er. “When barred the use of spear, and shield, “Her other arms will Wisdom wield; “And us that subtle Serf may teach “What mocks our arm to win by breach;— “Such will we, Guiscard, do and dare. “Here meet we when at set of sun “The bearded's Imaum's chaunt in air, In the time of the Emperor Manuel, the Turks had a mosque at Constantinople. “From mosque, proclaims the morrow done, “Ere then the fisher must be sought; “His wooded island lies in view, “Like mist upon the billows blue; “By me his lesson shall be taught:— “At night his skiff shall wait and brave, “Eastward, the storm and dashing wave, “Which there has scooped a cove;—a larch “Conceals the entrance to the arch. “I will find fitting means to shape “Prince Andron's dangerous escape:— “And, holy Freedom! fall or flee, “Our latest rites we pay to thee.” XV. Lazily sped that stormy night; The waves ran high, the winds sang loud, And if at times the moon's wan light Hung on the dark edge of a cloud, It was but to make more gloomily Those other shadows of the sky Frown on the earth as they hurried by; It was as if the shrouded dead Should pass before a murderer's bed, And whilst his red and glazing eye Was fixed in utter agony, It was as if a ray should steal On them, as silently they wheel, And light up in his gloomy brain, The immortality of pain. Deeming that spirits walked abroad, The lonely centinel was awed, Nor durst to echo trust the song Her mimic voice would oft prolong. Sheltered in keep, with eye and ear Awake, and all alive with fear, He watched till rolled the clouds away, And dim the horizon glowed with day. Ev'n when that day began to break, 'Twas with such dull and mournful flake As gleams in the volcano's dome, The thunder's haunt, and earthquake's home. Roused he the Warder;—at his call Rang loud the large and vaulted hall. With jealous key, the creaking doors Opened, and closed; and long the floors Retained his parting footstep's sound. He winds the lofty turret round, Slowly, and sad, and wearily, With heavy step and downward eye His first commission to relieve The captive of his bonds till eve. Now hath he gained that upper cell Where Pain hath dwelt and long must dwell. Why stands he yet upon the stair?— He starts! Prince Andron is not there! XVI. Sleep early fled from Manuel's eye; That morn he left his marble halls, And sought where form and dash from high The dazzling waterfalls; The tall cliff from whose savage brink The weak must fall, the daring shrink, Whose echoing cave and soaring peak Are vocal with the eagle's shriek; Whate'er the hand of Art has planned Of bold or awful, wild or grand, Here was not; but a softer scene, Now bright, now solemn, now serene,— Beautiful, and for ever green; As though to earth the sweets of heaven Maternal Nature's hand had given, And blended all her stores, to show How much of Eden rests below! Olive and myrtle, fig and vine, Spread forth their blooms and purple fruits; In darker vesture rose the pine; To heaven the cypress sent its shoots; And not one wind of all that swayed The roses' leaves, however slight, But with its wing of sweetness made The heart a Crœsus in delight. Thither, to suck their honey dew, With spiral tongue the bee-bird flew, With rapture drunk, and hung o'er them Like segment of a brilliant gem! And you might see the water-breaks Glide amid green pomegranate groves Which the sweet bird of Midnight loves, In many a maze irregular, To basins marble-paved, and there Repose in living lakes; And in the cool transparent spring Did birds of beauty dip the wing; And many a Temple rose, amid Those bowers, now seen, now faintly hid, Wherein fair figures were displayed, Hero and goddess, sage and maid. By these the Imperial monarch stood; One arm a pillar clasped around, And there in meditative mood, He listened to each gentle sound.— The turtle's wail, the dash profound, Of bubbling runnels gay with bliss, Might bring a balm to sorrow's wound, And charm a sterner soul than his: In sooth he felt their bland controul, Stealing like magic o'er his soul, With such sweet power as sages say, In desert wilderness astray, If virgin Beauty cross his path, Beguiles the Lion of his wrath;— Empire and care alike forgot, He stood as rooted to the spot By some o'ermastering charm! So have I seen in vernal woods, Wreathing amid the violet's buds, With seeming calmness in its eye, The darkly-brooding serpent lie As innocent of harm: Approach him, he uncoils his rings, And redly glares, and fiercely stings. Such seeming wildness wore thy face, Imperial Manuel! brief the space. He raised from thought his bending head. Whate'er it was that met his eye, I know not, but a stormy red,— The sunbeam of vindictive joy,— Flashed on his cheek whose smile might hide Successful hate and scornful pride; Such bitter smile as malice shows Upon the writhing lip of foes, When fortune to their wish consigns— Gift richer than Peruvian mines!— Long sought, long missed, a foeman's life, By drug, by dagger, or by knife!— But if the truth historians tell, If viewed he thence the citadel Where hopeless captives weep, We need no clue the cause to trace, Of changing blood in Manuel's face:— So hotly did it steep His pale brow, thought of Andron's name, Alone, could raise that fever's flame. XVII. But pondering on his victim's fate Whose step disturbs his privacy, What sounds are at the palace gate, That swell so wild and high? And O, why fly, like frantic things, Those slaves so variously? why rings Grove, temple, portico,—the tone Floats on his ear—“The Captive's gone!” Scarce conscious what that sound imparts, As from a dream the monarch starts; Hears voices round him, one by one, “Where is the king? the Captive's gone.” Intense distractedness of mein Upon his blanched front is seen;— But who may pause to contemplate That form?—his Nubian bursts the gate, And flies, and in alarming tone Exclaims, “my lord, the Captive's gone; “The warder saw him fettered well “Last eve; this morn a vacant cell! “No trace or token marked his flight! “Firm were the doors! no chains in sight!”— —“Ho! gird me on my scimetar; “The fugitive pursue; and bar “The City-gates. Speed, Suley, speed, “And call my guards and rein my steed.” Then turns he his upbraiding eye Abroad, on ocean, earth, and sky, And stamps his foot, and loudly cries “By heaven! this hour the traitor dies.” Nor in his fury seems to know, Fled is the man he calls his foe. With hurrying tramp and mingled din, Horseman and horse came pouring in With lance in hand, and spur on heel: “Haste! kill! pursue!” Their steeds they wheel, And seem annihilating space,— Such speed is in their rapid race. XVIII. The rearward horseman's vanished now, And Manuel stands in deep reflection. What sudden thought makes bright his brow?— A passing recollection Recalled from memory's shadowy page, And haste grows calm, and ebbs his rage, With wilder wave to renovate The full reflowing tide of hate; A moment's pause to clear again His dark suspicion's tangled chain. “Enough, my Nubian; bid or bring “Lady Eudora to her king; “Of this I might have deemed, when back “From Buda I had led my powers, “And learned how small a guard, and slack, “Had kept their vigil o'er those towers, “And that in Day's departing hours, “Thither the Lady would repair, “And tune in these forbidden bowers, “Her wild lute to the air; “The lute to which of yore I listened, “Till they said my eyes have glistened “With a strange and holy awe “Caught from her, derived from heaven, “And she, to touch so sweet a strain “To me but once, but once again, “Might deem her chief forgiven. “But, no! these are no Turkish plains, “Where that wayward chief might press “Some hot assault with glowing veins, “And at eve when weariness “He pressed, with active ardour, the siege of Mopsuestia; the day was employed in the boldest attacks; but the night was wasted in song and dance, and a band of Greek comedians formed the choicest part of his retinue. Andronicus was surprised by the sally of a vigilant foe; but, while his troops fled in disorder, his invincible lance transpierced the thickest ranks of the Armenians. On his return to the imperial camp in Macedonia, he was received by Manuel with public smiles and a private reproof—but the duchies of Naissus, Braniseba, and Castoria, were the reward or consolation of the unsuccessful general.” Gibbon's Dec. and Fall, chap. xlviii. “Slacked his vigour, swift transform “City shook by fire and storm, “To high revel in a camp, “Sped with dance and lit with lamp, “Beauty's smile for warrior's groan, “War's shrill clarion for the tone “Of his Lady's laughing lyre, “Which—but no, my brain is fire, “Seared by injury, steeled by wrong, “Not till now remembered long: “It was not enough, that I “Passed his fault with honours by, “Respecting him that in such hours, “Flushed with wine, and crowned with flowers, “He has tossed the wreath aside, “Sabre fastened to his side, “Donned his helmet, heron-plumed, “Banner shaken, shield resumed, “And changed the sallying Tecbir-cry The war-shout of the Turks and Arabs. “To one wild wail of agony. “Dukedoms, three, could not console “The shame, the' ambition in his soul. “Successless from Mopsuestia's siege, “He had the praises of his liege; “Rank, wealth, and every other want “Subject might claim, or sovereign grant. “When Braniseba's duke put on “Helmet with me, in Macedon, “What cause had he for plighting ring “With German or Hungarian king, “To bare his blade at twilight hour, “And under shadow of our power, “Disguised, draw to our tent, as though “He sought revenge on mortal foe? “Thought he, I ween, the crown I wear “Would beam more radiance on his hair, “That the pearled sceptre, only he “Of the Comnenian dynasty, “Could wave with majesty, or wield “Byzantium's warring spear and shield! “Fruitless the hope, and vain the task, “The' aspiring aim from me to mask! “His fire and genius well I know;— “A fearful friend,—more fearful foe;— “An enterprize, not fame can slake,— “A fortitude, no pain can shake;— “An open ear, an eye awake, “Resolving heart, contriving head, “And hand to do the deed of dread; “An angel's eloquence, to aid “The sweeping fierceness of his blade, “The spell-word whose Orphean charm “Might bid surrounding nations arm, “And speak the tempest to a calm; “And now, O now! what bush or brake “May veil the lion, hide the snake, “In glowing vengeance crouched to spring, “Or closely coiled to shoot the sting! “If once the fang is fixed, adieu “Life, empire, glory, what are you! “Yet shall he find, this vest beneath, “A heart”—His sword has left its sheath And his hand stabs the viewless air.— Soft! What entrancing form moves there? Like that same lion, bent to spring, Rage in his gesture, stands the king. XIX. Beautiful spirit! the radiant glow Of heaven's own purple seems over her flung, Dazzling the gazer, like the bow Which Mercy's hand in the storm has hung. And, O! so fair, so soft, so young! Can this Eudora be the star Which governed Andron's fate in war; She who his cares and toils to soothe, Left State's bright palace for the stir Of camps and leaguered towns? in sooth, Love's most enthusiast worshipper! Who all day long would watch with eye And heart that trembled but for him, His course of glory, till the sky, At dewfall, waxed dim, And the shrill horn recalled his foot From conquering charge, or far pursuit; She, who would then, with fond embrace, Unclasp the vizor from his face, Bear water whence cool fountains flow, To slake his thirst and bathe his brow, Or, last extremity of pain, Bind with her scarf the wounds which gush In heavy drops from the gashed vein; And whilst her bleeding hero deep Enjoys the fever-balm of sleep, Each rude, disturbing murmur hush, So that not e'en the slightest thing Had leave to flutter on the wing; In peril, care, and agony, His minister; can this be she? Well may the monarch start and gaze, Who knew her in her happier days, Ere yet the cankering worm of grief Preyed on her crisped virgin-leaf, When gay at heart, in beauty's bloom, Her eye shot sunshine through the room, And in the mirror of her face, Each rising feeling you might trace,— Whether Joy's smile, or Anger's flush, Or injured Pride's resenting blush Woke the black pupil's transient flash, Or gentle Pity dewed its lash, Or o'er her cheek as danger grew, Courage a stormy grandeur threw;— Ev'n like a blue transparent lake, Whose banks are bright with flower and tree, If zephyr only is awake Each blossom in its waves you see, But if the storm its wings unfurl, The darkening billows proudly curl, And to the eye its glass has given The thunder-clouds which gloom in heaven. XX. But summer rifles the lily's bell, And the frost of winter chills the rose, And time, whose flight is pleasure's knell, Has drugged youth's chalice deep with woes. From summer's blooms to winter's snows; From the hour when Autumn spreads her pall To the last sweet days of parting spring, When the fanciful hours aspire to fling Life, music, and flowers, o'er all; She seeks not,—rather shuns repose; And now her faded aspect shows Her many passions sunk in one:— The brilliant eye of other days, Dim, and the bosom cold to praise Which charmed so much when life begun; Sorrow alone on her white brow sits, And some deep feeling gleams by fits, Like ruins of the spirit's light Burning on through years of pain, As the moon's track on the main, Glimmers through the dark midnight. And beautiful, in time's despite, And lovely must the spirit be, Which loves on in dark and bright, Pain and bliss eternally! Such, amid despair, is she Whom her weeping maids have borne, From her villa by the sea, To the audience-room this morn;— She has nerved her heart with scorn; Put the purple on, to show Souls are great by tyrants torn, Hearts are haughty to a foe. XXI. Mutely, before the king, she stands; Nor heaves one sigh, nor clasps her hands; As if her injured heart might break, But to no earthly monarch quake. As if resolved her settled air Should to no human eye, declare How deep, or with what gall and smart, The torturing iron pierced her heart; And though the murmuring spring they hear Bubbling in the marble hall, And thousand things around appear, Past seasons to recal, When, at a word, she flew to tune Her soft lute many a summer-noon, To charm the king in his saloon, And rose, and jasmine, culled to bind Her braid of hyacinthine tresses, And at a call, his neck entwined In fond and innocent caresses;— The chill of snows would ill express Her dark eye's silent iciness, As, fixt on him, she ponders o'er Her many pangs that know no cure,— And Andron's bitter thrall! what more Can he inflict, or we endure! For in his red eye she can read The prelude to a darker deed, And this short pause of silent ire, Is like the pulseless airs which wrap The desolate volcano's cap, Ere the imprisoned flood of fire Flares like a banner to the sky, And the broad earthquake passes by. What may it be that can impart, To him that storminess of heart! Fearless, and with an air austere, She bends her from her height to hear. XXII. At length her scorn has fired his spirit proud, And rage bursts forth as lightning breaks the cloud; No single passion fluctuates in his mind, But a whole host, in warring chaos joined, Impels his heart, in swift tumultuous change, From fear to pride, from fondness to revenge:— “Slave of the man whom, like the reckless wind, “No threats could awe, no kindnesses could bind, “Say, in what dwelling lurks the trustless chief? “Nay, no upbraiding look, no seeming grief, “No hollow anguish, no dissembling sigh; “This instant answer, or prepare to die. “Hemlock has poison, agony the wheel, “The burning iron and the smiting steel; “Then would it 'vail those orbs that they have worn “A ray of beauty or a glance of scorn?— “Scorched to their sockets by the searing brand, “Nor light, nor triumph, can they more command; “Stretched on the winding wheel, would that soft limb “Have vanity for you, or charm for him? “Such things there are, and lovelier ones have known “Their being in the pangs which quenched their own. “Coils he, an adder, near us?—or, more brave, “Flies with the steed on land, or rides the wave? “Where rests—where flies—how 'scaped he? Briefly give “The word I claim, and live,—in glory live, “Crowned with the gems of wealth, the pomp of power: “Here empire wooes thee, and there frowns the tower, “The grate, the cell, the prison: aye! the chain, “The groan, the gloom, the penance, and the pain, “Eternal solitude, and whirling brain! “Look up! survey the sun, flowers, fountains, sky, “Rapture on earth, and life and light on high; “To be a captive, or a denizen, “Caitiff with owls, or goddess-like with men.— “What have I said? where are we? I should know “That pallid cheek, and chill, declining brow. “Where are the roses fled to? that light form “Was once Eudora, but the sun and storm “Of battle have wrought changes, and her mind “Has left, perchance, remembrance far behind, “When by these fountains, in those cypress-bowers,— “Nay, shrink not, start not,—melody was ours, “And moonlight dances, revelry, and song, “Sped time upon a fairy's foot along; “Why should a hateful shadow come between? “Speak! be the future what the past has been, “Torn by no anguish, haunted by no crime, “A happy pageant, and a festal time;— “Refuse, and well thy former guilt I know, “A seeming virtue, but a wily foe; “The lyre, the tune, the hour, the steel, the crape, “The ready steed, and signal for escape!— “Not vainly did that eye of treason then “Glance through the gloom, and dive within the glen;— “Not vainly didst thou fling to those who hem “Thy swift retreat, the bribe of gold or gem.— “Enough, reveal this mystery, and be free;— “I wage not war with lovely things like thee.” XXIII. —“Yes, am I changed! time was, I could have borne “Thy praise; all, save thine anger and thy scorn; “For then thou wert no tyrant, wert too pure, “Too free thyself and generous to immure “Chiefs amid chains and torture,—one who dyed “His spear in bloody battle by thy side, “Thy friend, almost thy brother, one who blew “With thee his tasselled horn, who tracked the dew “With the same beagles, and with equal skill “Drew shafts upon the same Thessalian hill. “Look on me! sun, storm, battle, I can brave, “Shrieks on the field, and perils on the wave; “They flung no grief, no paleness on my brow, “No dagger at my heart, but it was Thou:— “Andron must thy unjust resentment bear, “For fancied crimes, and wrestle with despair. “'Twas thus that sorrow sapped my vital bloom, “And pale consumption marked me for the tomb; “Even this weak frame must thou essay to shake, “Not for mine own, but for another's sake! “Kings tread not on the fallen; kings are just;— “A tyrant thou, and traitor to thy trust; “A king has pity, mercy; thou hast none; “Of all thy petty gifts, I asked but one,— “To share his lingering penance,—'twas denied: “You coolly smiled, presumptuous in your pride. “It shames me that you saw my tears to flow, “But I am more, am more than woman now; “Changed, gauntletted by injury to fling back “Scorn on thy gems, defiance to thy rack. “I aid Prince Andron's flight! what aiding power “Have I?

All words, all eloquence were faint, The monarch's paroxysm to paint, As veering now from rage to pride, His mantle-folds he threw aside; And, fixed on his dark forehead, sate A mingled scowl of pain and hate. He stamped his foot, and, at his call, His armed vassals filled the hall, And for a minute's space, no sound Was heard their deepening files around, But awe and wonder o'er them spread The unstirring silence of the dead. Quivered the monarch's lips, and clung To the palate's roof his tongue, Till within his lowering eye Brighter fires of anger woke A spell of stronger mastery— Pointing to the turrets nigh, Terribly he spoke: “Away, away, this Lady bear “Up yon dark tower's winding stair; “Sleepless eyes beneath her wait,— “Adamantine be the grate;— “If a hand but wave below, “Lip salute, or head but bow, “Headman's axe shall be his doom, “Hers, a dungeon's deeper gloom. “Haughty woman, have thy will, “Share his penance, share his ill; “Weep by day, by night repine, “Suns shall rise, and planets shine “To thy drooping eye in vain. “Never shalt thou break the chain “Which around thine arm I wind, “Till prince Andron comes to bind “His with that which humbleth thee, “Sealer of his destiny! “Then may'st thou again be free. “We, meanwhile, will hem his path, “And if he should meet our wrath, “His shall be the sepulchre, “Thine the eternal cell's despair. “Princess, dost thou now obey? “She speaks not. Hurry her away, “Nor let those whimpering slaves be near “To whisper treason in her ear.” XXV. How fares the high Eudora now? Falls not the pride that stamped her brow? No! flashing lance and pealing drum Have failed her bosom to benumb. Though by sabres compassed round, Heedless that the tyrant frowned, As she passed, her lip again Assumed a smile of cool disdain. Thence by numbers borne away, Through the court where fountains play, She is swiftly passing now, And by the dark cupressine bough; Slowlier hold they on their march, As they near the ribbed arch. Hark! the unfolding portals creak— And close; but neither voice nor shriek, Meets the monarch, listening still. One lone trumpet, loud and shrill, Telling him the tale, repined In the melancholy wind.— Sadly it fell, and sadly rose, Like the gust o'er winter's snows, When there falls no glimpse of light, O'er the desolate midnight, And the hollow-voiced wave, In fitful sorrow heard to rave, Bears the wild summons to the deep, In whitening flash and whirling sweep. Thrice it rose, and thrice it fell, A wild lament, a troubled knell; The wind blew by, and, dismally, Flung the tidings far to sea. O'er the murmuring billows blue, Away, away the sea-bird flew; The sea-boy, mounted in his shroud, Looked high on main, and cape, and cloud, And strained the canvas to the mast, As there were evil in the blast. The fisher deemed a storm was nigh, And plied his oars incessantly, And scudded forward free to reach His wooded islet's golden beach. Sparkle his dipping oars;—'tis won— Whilst redly glares the lurid sun, Which, as his flapping sail is furled, Sinks, and 'tis twilight o'er the world. END OF CANTO I. CANTO II. “Hah! was it fancy's work;—I hear a step— It hath the speech-like thrilling of his tread: It is himself!” Maturin. I. As brightly wild the hours of Glory run, So throng her shadows, and so sinks her sun; That brilliant Circle which the day-star drew Round Nature, is her type of being too: See first how splendour's rushing rays adorn The peopled towers of empire in her morn; Thither the yet barbaric nations pour, And Battle's blast is blown from shore to shore. By fire and freedom in her bright noon nursed, The glow of genius is a glorious thirst; Then Power his pinnacle bestrides, and we View Taste spring forth, like Venus from the sea, Radiant, and pure, and goddess-like to draw High aspirations, settling into awe. Last Pride and Luxury, wedded to decay, Conceal, in clouds, the ruins of her ray; Faint, and more faint, upon the dial falls That ray, long shadows creep o'er crumbling walls; When that, her sunshine of renown expires, The sons forget the grandeur of their sires; Heroes are shrunk to vassals; deeds sublime Are scoffed; and Liberty becomes a crime; Scarce known, through Slavery's gathering shadows flit, Like ghosts, the forms of Wisdom and of Wit; Taste breaks her pencil; Hope her charmed glass,— Another age—and her descendants pass O'er altars rent, and sculptures green with grass; From gilded halls, the crouching tiger springs, And ivy crests the Capitols of kings; Doubt on his moonlit marbles sits, and spells Disputed names, and cancelled chronicles; And as the melancholy wind repines Through vacant temples, and deserted shrines, Sighs o'er the vigils which his fondness keeps, Or sickens at the solitude and weeps. II. Yet with her day of majesty, not all Is wrapt in night's annihilating pall; Memory and song transmit her patriot's name, Through years of wrong, and centuries of shame; Our eye once more upon their pages cast, Forgets the present and renews the past; Lit by their ray again, a golden shower Of sunshine hangs on temple and on tower; The fluted column burns; in bright relief, Each statue stands of goddess and of chief; The olive grows more green; a murmuring sound Steals the rich shrines and holy mountains round. All things existent, speak of spirit still,— The rock, the flower, the ocean, and the hill; On its blue crag the' Acropolis defies The strength of time, the lightnings of the skies; Each field, each wave o'er which the mighty flew, By fancy tinged with inspiration's hue, Despite the fallen fane, the people's trance, Still breathe of power, of passion, and romance. III. Thus is there beauty still upon thy cheek, Pride of the modern Goth, and elder Greek, Queen of the Orient! Thou, whom Constantine Crowned, in a bridal hour, almost divine, To keep perpetual Glory's golden keys; All earth thy dower, thy ministers all seas. Though thy fair halls a tyrant makes his home,— And the Seraglio shows its burnished dome, Though the high Mosque a sainted sod profane, Though bearded Moslems shame Sophia's fane, Thou hast thy beautiful dust,—urns which enfold The ashes of thy demigods of old;— The same wild path of waves too, which has worn And to the Crescent shaped thy Golden Horn, The harbour of Constantinople obtained, in a very remote period, the denomination of the Golden Horn. Its figure was a curve resembling the horn of an ox. The epithet of golden was expressive of the riches which every wind wafted from the most distant countries into its secure and capacious port. That path o'er which Minerva's Xenophon, From red Cunaxa called his heroes on; The baffled Persian barred his way in vain, And idly round him shook his empty chain; In all, through all, he mocked the' insidious foe, The Median sling and the barbaric bow; Chill, faint with famine, bleeding, wasted, wet, Firm, though betrayed, and conquering, though beset; O'er snows and sands they strive; O, can it be! Is yon the heaving of the dark blue sea? The shout of happy thousands rends the air: “The sea! the sea!” and all is safety there. The account which Xenophon gives in his history of the celebrated retreat of the Ten Thousand, of the event alluded to in the text, is one of the most interesting passages in that interesting work; one, which, after the long series of dangers to which his daring band had been exposed, awakens in the mind of the reader no common sympathy: we participate in all the joy of such a discovery. “The fifth day they arrived at the high mountain called Theches. As soon as the vanguard had ascended the mountain, and beheld the sea, they raised a mighty shout, which when Xenophon and those in the rear heard, they concluded that some other enemies were attacking them in front, for the people belonging to the country they had burned followed their rear, some of whom those who had the charge of it had killed, and taken others prisoners in an ambuscade; they had also taken twenty bucklers, made of ox-hides, with the hair on.” “The noise still increasing as they came nearer, and the men, as fast as they came up, running to those who still continued shouting, their cries swelled with their numbers; so that Xenophon, thinking something more than usual had occurred, mounted his horse, and taking with him Lycius and his troop of cavalry, rode up to their assistance, and presently they hear the soldiers shouting—“THE SEA! THE SEA!” and cheering one another. At this all the rear-guard ran with the rest and thither were driven the horses and beasts of burden. When all were come together on the top of the mountain, they embraced their general, their captains, and one another, with many tears. And there, by whose orders is uncertain, the soldiers instantly bring together a vast number of stones, and raise a great monument, on which they placed a number of shields made of raw hides, and many other trophies taken from the enemy.” Xenophon, Anab. Lib. iv. cap. 7. As o'er the blackening Bosphorus they sweep, Byzantium seems to meet them on the deep, And gladdening thoughts of their dear Athens come In each green olive and columnar dome; There, in bright hour, resigned that glorious soul, The warrior's trophy, for the sage's stole, And left his name and story evermore, To charm a world he almost saved before. IV. But past that vision, later ages roll, Nor is Byzantium near, but Istamboul; There, yet, a Greek the throne of Julian fills, And sees a lordlier Athens on the hills, Looks with wide eye around the vext Euxine, But not to hail a warrior from its brine; One came, and what was his embrace?—a chain. Long may he gaze there, but to gaze in vain. Long be Prince Andron hid from Manuel's eye, Whate'er his doom, and wheresoe'er he fly! V. The blush of the eve fadeth dim o'er the water; The night-wind is rising, and billows dash high, As in her lone tower, Stamboul's loveliest daughter Looks abroad from her lattice o'er ocean and sky. There's a frown in the heaven, and a gloom on the ocean, And a low, hollow dirge in the lapse of the wind, That well suit the sad melancholious emotion, The feeling and fire of a musical mind,— Of one whose live chords with swift impulse will borrow A token and tone from the hue of the hour, Inspiration in joy, and sereneness in sorrow, Subdued into patience, but latent with power. She turned to the page of the past;—'twas a dream;— To the future;—'twas life without one joyous ray; For quenched in despair was the tremulous beam, Her beacon by night, and her vision by day. O, O! for a wing the dark storm to outfly Like the birds of the storm that so soaringly shriek Round her turret, to kindle a cresset on high, On each Asian precipice, castle, and peak; Though dim, it might lure him to anchor in sands Where the wave lies serenest in haven and bay. Now, haply, his bark the wild element strands, Assassins surround, or the ruthless betray! With that image came terror, and lowering suspense, And doubt, giant lord of the rack and the wheel, Whose ordeal, wrought up into torture intense, Not the loftiest can scorn, nor the haughtiest conceal!— She felt it—Eudora, steal over her frame, And the veil of her fantasy strip from her eye, As the earthquake of night, that, long slumbering in flame, Rends the mantle of Nature in passing her by. “I could brook,” she exclaimed, “the foul finger of scorn, “The scowl of contempt, and the menace of hate, “These, these, I could bear, and unmurmuring have borne “With a bosom undaunted, and spirit elate; “But to linger for ever in towers, to commune “With nought but the sun-loving swallow, and cloud, “Soaring free,—soaring free!—in calm regions of noon, “Of their limitless pleasure and liberty proud, “And alone on the frailty of fortune relying, “To gaze on, to envy their transit, and feel “There is wormwood in life, and a solace in dying, “Yet to linger, weep, tremble, and agonize still;— “And at night, when her poppies should silence the toil “Of the mind, and hush all its wild fancies asleep, “To dream of the loved and the absent, awhile, “In slumber to smile, and awaking to weep;— “I know not—this dark brain, now tearless and dry, “May reel with its sufferance, and thus it were well; “But gently, O maid of the lunatic eye, “Lay thy shaft on my heart, and it will not rebel; “For thee, savage Chief, unrepentant in ire,— “Hark! hark! 'tis the voice of the injured that calls! “May thy hearth be usurped by the ivy and briar, “And the fox and owl hoot in thy tenantless walls! “Dim, dim through the compassing clouds of decay, “The stars that o'er-ruled thy nativity shine, “Thy sceptre soon shivered, thy crown passed away, “To circle a forehead more royal than thine: “I err not; there sits on a shadowy throne, “Whose steps are on kingdoms, the form of the brave, “With finger that beckons, ah me! 'tis his own! “Now, haughty Insulter! down, down to the grave!” VI. With filmed eye, and fixed look, As if her brain, indeed, were reeling, Eudora trembled as she spoke This more than earthly burst of feeling; For there was visioned to her sight With martial figures compassed round, A form, an eye like Andron's, bright, With sceptred hand, and arm unbound,— But dark his cheek as one who frowned Some object of his hate to see,— Fetter or chain, whose cankering wound He wears to all eternity; And in his eye there still was dread, As one not yet unused to pain,— That sleepless sense of torture fled, Whilst dark remembrances remain, Which Titan on his rock would feel Loosed from his eagle and his chain, Or mad Ixion from his wheel, That ordeal of a brain Blinded by Night's long tyrannies, To which the very light of skies Were agony, until it grew Fixed and familiar to the view: But his Byzantine diadem Was starred with many a flaming gem, Opal, and pearl, and amethyst, Torn from turbans of the East, And crouched on many a gonfalon, From Syria's holiest ramparts won; His feet the Turkish libbard kissed;— It might be but a phantasm sent In pity from the world of dreams, A show which fancy oft has lent To soften passion's fierce extremes, But which in years of brighter date, The future quickens into fate. Whence, or whate'er that gifted vision Which charmed her soul with thoughts Elysian, Or of the future or the past, It could not, and it did not last: The image of that sceptred king, The glittering diadem he wore, Passed by, like an unreal thing, And she but listens to the roar Of rising winds and tossing seas, And the stormy music which the breeze Makes as it drives ashore The big waves, that, in ceaseless lash, Heavily boom, and whitely dash. VII. A moment, and Eudora's heart, Its own proud quietude regains, And high resolve and courage, dart A keener current through her veins. But hark; she hears the dread tambour Beat an alarum near her tower, In a wild, a muffled knell. “Blessed Virgin! can it be, “Is my chief no longer free! “Seek they this lone cell!” Hush, for the cry of warder!—no; But the wailing trumpets blow Accents sorrowful and shrill. Vale to valley, hill to hill, Wave to wave, the signal tossed; In the captive's fancy naming Andron's name, with grief proclaiming Lost, for ever lost. In the courts around, below, Heard was many a voice, recounting Fruitless chasing of the foe; Knights from weary steeds dismounting; Horses pawing, arch resounding; Watchword passed to centinel; Helm unbuckling; sabre sheathing; Soldier curse or blessing breathing On the mighty scaped so well. Sounds now ceasing, now renewing, Rising on the ear, and fainting, Andron gone beyond pursuing:— Hers is pleasure past the painting. Now there's not a voice in hearing, Knight on knight is disappearing From the area's space, below. Ye, who've seen the battle veering, Doubting, trembling, hoping, fearing, Banners rearing, sinking, rearing, Till a panic seized the foe, And they fled, like winds on ocean, With a terrible commotion,— That lone lady's deep emotion, Ye, and ye alone, can know. Far-off is the tambour beating;— Far-off are the bugles greeting; Ceasing as the bands they number, Striking now the hour of slumber. In an echo, deep and low, Through the silent city ranging, Stationed guards the watch are changing. Hark! again their trumpets blow Accents silver toned and shrill!— Not a beagle now is baying, Soldier shouting, war-horse neighing;— All lies gathered, dark and still. VIII. All is still but the wind on the wave, The minute-beat of the ocean's pulse! All is at rest but the hoarser rave Of rushing tides which the walls repulse,— That mighty voice, that hollow sound From all the mustering billows round, Heaved in a mass from realm to realm, As if the floods which erst did whelm The universal earth, were yet Not all assuaged, nor could forget How, in their rushing might, went down, Temple on temple, tower on town, The lofty mountains wild and wide With all their snows upon them,—Pride In his communion with the stars,— Battle, with all his crests and cars,— All, all the Omnipotent created, And none were left of millions, none But Pyrrha and Deucalion, To watch the waves as they abated, And smile, amid their wilderness, When the first star of their new night Put forth from clouds, its lonely light As Venus dimly does on this. With thoughts like theirs, Eudora sate, Her eye upon the roaring strait; Earth, was, to her, that vacant ball, And she the only left of all. But yet not wholly left:—a strain Is heard from Passion's sweetest string; To the Genii of the main, Is it that sister-spirits sing! Is it that the sea-shell rings With the west-wind's visitings, Now just hushed,—now mildly waking Sounds which the hoarse sea is breaking, And breathing now, when it seemed o'er, A heavenlier strain than all before! IX. Bright in the bosom of the west, There shines a track in the stormy skies;— Is it the wan moon's wasting crest, Which sheds one luminous smile and flies!— Its momentary lustre lies, With lapse of shadow, on the main, But flashes through her glimmering grate, On each memorial of her fate,— Portal and pillow, bar and chain,— And shows a cedarn lute, uphung Ere the beam was in its wane, O'er which the fairy-footed winds, Had walked in tenderness, and flung The all unearthly strain Which came, which often comes to gentle minds, Who eye the brightness of that star which binds Our life with beauty in a magic link With each fresh ray which thence our spirits drink. X. From the high and sullen walls She that lute of lutes hath taken; Happy airs in happy halls, It was ever wont to waken. There is a bliss in every touch Of chords where Andron's used to linger; But yet her numbers are not such:— Hark ye to her fairy finger. 1. “Camest thou, trembling soul of sound, from o'er the heaving sea To bear the voice of him I love, absent although he be! Gladness was in each tone; but yet these waters of my woe Obey not the beguiling charm; they lie too deep to flow. This heart, alas! has long been chill, and dry this aching brain, And I deem, even now, of a Princess' pride, that it should not stoop to pain. 2. “I sit in the visions of my thought, my palace-hall a tower, And memory traces yet for me, thy first departing hour. All day I watched, though fled the ship, thy pathway on the sea, Which though serene as light, yet seemed to darkly frown on me; The dashing of the sable waves, the murmur of the blue. Re-echoed back upon my heart, thy desolate adieu. 3. “I sit in the visions of my thought; 'twas sunset on the main, The Turkish blast of war blew o'er, we flew to our hills again. To scenes of liberty and peace, where heroes of old name Blew Freedom's Grecian clarion, till the world filled with their fame; It was thy bliss by Delphi's wave, and consecrated shrine, To dwell upon their deeds as my warm spirit did on thine. 4. “But through the bowers where turtles dwell, the eagle's eye may roam, And loved Parnassus' mountain-peaks will be the thunder's home: The war-bell tolled our knell of peace, but still it was a charm To watch the floating of thy crest, the waving of thine arm, Till gashing swords rained wounds on thee, and then my brain became Frantic with agony and fear,—all ashes, yet all flame. 5. “I sit in the visions of my thought; a vesper-hymn arose,— Old Stamboul's sword was scabbarded, and vanished were her foes! On the golden sands of the shelly sea, at evetide, were we met, And still we gazed, and lingering watched, though many a star had set.— Who, at so sweet an hour, could hear immortal ocean roar, And leave to vacancy and night, that dear romantic shore? 6. “But ev'n at that delicious hour, and on that tranquil path, Rapt in such joy as angels feel, and pure Elysium hath,— In that divinity of thought—soothed, softened, melted, awed, Hate spoke his malison, and poured his vials all abroad; Why did I e'er survive that night, why when the morning frowned, Wake from the sickly trance of grief to see my warrior bound! 7. “Then agony—but thou art safe, and I should not repine,— Bright flowers bedeck thy goodly stem! they bloom no more on mine. In the loved presence of my lord, I stood a beauteous tree, The glory of sweet waters near, the banquet of the bee;— The lightning fell, nor dew nor shower can ever gladden more My leafless branches, for decay is busy at the core. 8. “Orion proudly mounts the sky, pale shimmering through the shower;— Why does he bend a guiding ray to this sepulchral tower! The weight of sleep is on my lids; winds, clouds, stars, waters, ye Must be my ministers of rest, my sentries must ye be!— Give all your sounds to this lorn lute, when silent and uphung, That life, captivity, and light, may look like strangers long! XI. Not long the golden juice might lie Of slumber on Eudora's eye; In restless ecstacy, her dream Made night's uncertain phantoms seem Like him she loved, for ever near;— But flying, ever, chased by fear, And she as on the wings of wind, Was hasting evermore behind. In seeming swiftness, now they pass The spiry cliff, the quick morass, And hill whose windy summit forms Wild lineament of clouds and storms, Which, as she tracked his steps with pain, Would tear him from her sight again. Anon, bewildering Fancy gave Her wanderer to the dancing wave; Blue glowed the waters, and on high His sails swelled in a cloudless sky;— She had forsook her hated tower, Had baffled Manuel's jealous power, And far, upon the tossing main, His flying vessel sought to gain. The shore was near; the' ambitious prow Chid the long billows' lingering flow; But as the sails the seamen furl, The whirlwinds rise, the surges curl; A moment—and the form he wore Is whelmed beneath the ocean-floor. Now seem the war-drum and the fife, Again to call her chief to life; With plated cuirass on his breast, With white plume waving, lance in rest, On, on he rushed to victory, “For Stamboul!” was the battle-cry, And cloven shield, and turban-fold, Horseman and horse, beneath him rolled;— But, full upon her startled view, Distinct, a Giant shadow grew! His arm ascending in the sky, Unsheathed the sabre from his thigh, Dark Manuel's form he seemed to wear, With laughing shout, and frantic air, Her visioned Prince he sternly smote, Who groan or murmur uttered not, But strove one only thought to claim, In utterance of her gentle name. His timeless fate her woe would weep, And anguish broke the bonds of sleep. XII. She woke in terror, and her eye, awake, Yet seemed in ghastly energy to ache With some such vision as in sleep appeared To woo her to the danger which she feared, For as upon the lonely walls it fell, She saw a shadow move across the cell,— Slow, but distinct, no creature of the brain, It paused,—it moved,—and then it paused again. Eudora, startled at the Presence, said “What form art thou which risest from the dead “To awe my sorrow? Ha! I know thee now, “O Andron! O my husband! it is thou!— “The paleness of the grave is on thy brow. “And thou wert buried in the darkening deep:— “I knew it! there was torture in my sleep! “Speak to my spirit, shade of air, or place “Thy shadowy form once more in my embrace.” It was no dream: she rushed that shade to clasp, And a strong arm of iron met her grasp. She feebly, fondly shrieked; that shriek again Another's voice of gladness made more plain. A few wild accents faltered on her tongue;— To his fond arms the sad Eudora sprung, Threw back the tresses of her hair, though weak, That hers might feel the pressure of his cheek, Which chill at first, and tremulous, became With the next pulse, all fever and all flame, Flushed with a hope too strong for mortal faith, And scarcely conscious of his life or death; He kissed her beating temples,—stilly kissed,— And, whispering, strove to clear away the mist Which wrapt her soul,—those thoughts which scarce we feel— When dread and doubt contend with hope and zeal. It is the living Andron in her arms, Who stills her tremors, and her terror calms!— “Fear not, Eudora, heaven has heard thy prayer, “It still has left some joy for both to share;— “But hush! though deep the stair, thy voice may tell “My tale of wonder to the centinel. “I heard, I hear his footfall in the gale.— “Hark to the tread!—now list, I have a tale.” —'Twas long ere that delicious agony Was o'er, that flood of deep suspense and joy; Long, long her eye the glassy lustre took, Which on the seeming spirit bent its look, Till, cleared from her delusive dream of fear, She faintly smiled, and bowed her head to hear. XIII. “Manuel thou know'st, with what a jealous guard “These towers he strengthened and this cell he barred,— “Barred from approach alike of friend and foe, “A spy within, a bloodhound lurked below, “That so, if ev'n the virtue of the grape “Might steep all others, this might track escape. “Whilst thou, my life, wert near at times to soothe “My hopes, all blighted in their fire of youth, “To give thy soft voice to the summer-wind, “And teach the sullen warder to be kind,— “Whilst thy stol'n visits made my chains sit well, “I was a Prince, though fettered in my cell!— “My first, sole feelings, giv'n to love and thee, “I recked not of the bliss of being free; “But when his active hate afar removed “The form I worshipped, and the voice I loved, “I felt an angry malice in my veins, “And burned, and fretful, strove to break my chains, “If only in defiance of the wrong, “To sting the' unfeeling, and to pique the strong; “But every rivet of the fettering coil “With firmness mocked the toiler and the toil, “Till, late last night, in grinding rage I lent “My utmost vigour to the fierce intent;— “It bent! it snapped as by a powerful charm! “Oh! it was heaven once more to stretch my arm “In freedom to the stars, and wave abroad “The bickering splendours of my sheathless sword! “He left me this with sneers but ill concealed “To mock the hand which should essay to wield,— “But wielding this, I still the power command “To teach the long-chained arm, the writhing hand, “The long reversion of their wrongs to quit, “Till pride of art repays his scornful wit. “I next surveyed my cell from side to side, “With loftier instinct, and an ampler stride, “And each lethargic sense, with freedom, rose “To tenfold strength from languor's long repose; “And prying grew my gaze; that gaze was thrown “By chance, at length, upon a loosening stone, “Through whose small cleft I felt the crannying air: “The stone removed, light broke on my despair,— “I saw the semblance of a broken stair! “A glimpse of hope, one glimpse, however brief, “Will rouse the loneliest captive from his grief. “I toiled till midnight, in that secret way; “On arched walls in ruinous decay “The moon through rifts her lonely lustre threw; “I hailed the omen with dilated view; “And now resolved the cavern to explore, “Replaced, with care, the loose stones of the floor. “There have I walked, and heard the quickening sound “Of waters rolling freely, but profound. “I know not where it leads, but, where it leads “Are tangled roots, loose earth, and clustering weeds, “And there some outlet we may find, or shape “By mine or breach, the means of our escape. “I heard all day the shrilling horn proclaim “The captive's freedom, and the monarch's shame, “And smiled to think, that I, in my dim vault, “Could with such dread the purple-born assault! “I heard the rush of steeds, the creaking gates, “(How my heart shudders whilst my tongue relates!)— “Which to this sullen cell my love betrayed:— “But, fear not, all shall sternly be repaid; “And if to bound once more upon the tide, “In nature's freedom, be a wish denied, “Life yet shall roll rejoicingly away, “Thy arms my camp, thy smile of smiles my ray, “Till, tempered to thy loveliness of soul, “Death opes a portal to the years which roll “In music, and our bark obeys the breeze, “To happy islands o'er celestial seas.” XIV. Then came the long embrace, the scanning eye, The eager question, and the fond reply; The feelings uttered of departed years, Sweet smiles of rapture, and still sweeter tears. To one who long in pain has pined apart, How grateful rush those ‘waters of the heart!’ The cord which bound the brain, beneath the thirst Of long-denied relief is brightly burst; And then, how fast, how free those currents rise!— The heart transfers all utterance to the eyes. No desert spring, just found in cooler skies, Ere the breath thickens, and the traveller dies,— No sound which life's scarce-beating pulse recals, Of palms that whisper with the cloud that falls, Comes with such gladdening import to his ear, As the full flow of Hope's forgotten tear; The heart's sweet flowers though withered long ago, Fed by those drops, catch freshness as they flow, And give their incense to the winds again, In grateful triumph o'er remembered pain. XV. Eudora trembled, though by tears relieved;— It was so sudden, scarce could be believed. An hour ago so tortured, now so blest! In the past—anguish,—in the future—rest! She wished no more than, thus, in chambers dim, To gaze, love, listen, weep once more with him: Day, midnight, eve, may roll unheeded now, Too happy she to think if swift or slow; Nor can the seasons, in their changes more Brighten or chill;—the billow on the shore Which lately broke, as with bewildered groan, Has much of music in its loneliest tone,— It seems to say, they are the only two With whom earth, sky, and ocean have to do. XVI. To thoughts of lightest kind, joy lends his ray, And paints the morrow brighter than to day; Though not by day, with Andron, can she steal The bliss to speak, the paradise to feel, To watch with him the clouds that flit and flee, The gliding ships, the sunsets o'er the sea, And birds of calm that dip their azure wings In ocean, loveliest of a thousand things,— Yet can she soothe the darkness of his cell, With glad inventions that shall please as well. Romantic harp, and legendary song, Shall make his hours of absence seem less long; And the resounding voice of one so dear, Falling like seraph's hymns upon his ear, Shall soothe each wild anxiety, and still The many thoughts that blindly war with will. The night is all their own; and O, the night Has charms—the hours in their so silent flight, Each stamped with lovelier feeling than the last, And each more prized in passing to the past. The faint white flush long lingering in the west, The stars revolving, and all earth at rest Save two fond souls, the only ones which find Their Eden in this vigil of the mind:— The all-transfusing eye, the placid brow, The whispering undertone, the murmured vow, The midnight watch o'er weariness asleep, The chronicles which they together keep, The clouds that round the moon in shadow lay, The yellow moonshine brightening all the bay, Or, yet more stirring to a heroine's soul, The thunders in their repercussive roll, The storm, the wind, the lightning, and the sweep Of the gigantic waters of the deep. XVII. Yes,—these shall all be theirs, and hers the care To save the ripest fruits for him to share, Or whate'er else stern Manuel may impart To feed with life her agony of heart, To smile away the clouds which intervene To make his present what the past had been; And he, too, in such visions, feeleth more Of promised comfort than in years before. Yes! though a thousand tender ties allied The young, the plighted bridegroom to his bride, Though 'twas his pride in love's ecstatic hour To tend her as a florist tends a flower, Note each bright sparkle of her eye, each tress Whose motion was a living loveliness, Treasure each object that had felt her touch, And ever in her absence think of such, Yet, never, in her bridal hours, she seemed So beautiful as now, when o'er her streamed Her hair from recent sorrow loosely thrown On the fair breast that throbbed for him alone— Now,—when her many sufferings all approved How she resented, and how fondly loved. The blooms of virgin passion past away, Time gives to Woman deeper claims than they,— That new existence flushing round the heart, The friendship, pure, which acts a sister's part. No act of hers but breathes a secret charm, Desires all innocent, affections warm; The white transparent candour of the brow, No false appearance, no dissembled vow, But open faith, unconscious of a crime, Emotions mild, and harmonized by time; A concord ripened into love sincere, Kind without doubt, and tender without tear;— The electric threads which by new instincts tied, Age does but strengthen, pain can not divide: Touched by the hand that spun them, how they thrill! So fond in good, so doubly fond in ill, That only at our glance of scorn or hate, Scorched they recoil, and leave us to our fate! XVIII. Fortune not oft seems anxious to atone The wrongs of years, and blend all joys in one, When grand events in sure succession flow, Wave after wave, nor yet too fast, nor slow,— When various means, in due gradation tend, Firm to one purpose, faithful to one end, As though to lifeless things were given a sense Of good and evil, an intelligence To deal around, for years of crime and wrong, Strength to the weak, and weakness to the strong; Yet now to Andron's lot such grace was lent, To soothe a spirit broken but unbent, As if heaven now had made him all its care, In one glad moment answering years of prayer. XIX A tower stood near in sight, whose battled frieze Sung to the wing and wildness of the breeze, Where oft the sea-bird in its fear would hie, When winds were up, and tempests swept the sky; With clustering ivy were the loopholes hid; Seaward the steep cliffs all access forbid;— Poised on the boiling surf, it seemed to be An island rock, or pillar of the sea. But not on all sides beaten,—for to view On one grey side, high clustering alders grew, In florid verdure beautiful; the more As Andron oft had watched their growth before;— Hour after hour it was his wont to stand, And watch the leaf a twig, the twig a wand, The wand a graceful sapling in whose leaves The small birds sang so sweet in summer-eves:— The very leaves brought peace to him, they played With such sweet interchange of light and shade, And threw, when all was black and parched around, Bright thoughts of freedom in their whispering sound— In that quick sympathy of thought which finds Love in the trees, rocks, waters, stars, and winds, So full with feeling that it must express That love, or perish with its mute excess. XX. There are mysterious sounds at this lone hour, Heard from the rustling ivies of that tower, The alder-branches, rent, in ruin fall, And steps are surely heard upon the wall, And voices through the wind to answering voices call. And something like the name of Andron there, To them the many-murmuring billows bear. The prince looked out, the eastern clouds were white With morn's first flush, and by that dubious light He sees a beckoning form which now is bent, 'Twixt sea and sky, above his battlement. 'Tis Cosmo! in far sterner hours than these, Towers he has scaled o'erhanging deeper seas, When every step was o'er a foeman slain, A turbaned Turk, or prostrate Saracen. “Captive, a stranger and a friend, behold:— “I smile at danger, fortune aids the bold. “Haste! to thyself thy flight and freedom owe, “Night rolls away, a bark is moored below, “And once afloat, no arm can countervail “The tossing billow and the driving sail. “Cosmo of Venice knows no idle fear;— “I pitied thy sad doom, and I am here; “Nor shalt thou doubt my truth,—a jewelled ring, “This scarf enfolds, fit signet of a king, “Found on the morrow of that midnight strife “Which left thee, Christian captive, nought but life.” XXI. And Andron knew that figured scarf of pride, Though deeply stained, had wrapt his early bride; And this the monarch's ring, the seal of power Which stamped his will on that remembered hour. He faltered thanks to heaven! a beam of thought Flashed on his mind, and there like sunshine wrought; “Stranger, he said, I tax thy courage high, “The path is dangerous which thou needs must try; “For me I reck not of the venturous limb “To scale a turret or the billow swim; “But on thy aid, Eudora must depend;— “This instant, therefore, with the ring descend, “And at the orient gate, beside the sea, “Seeks out the Cyprian guard who holds the key,— “Brief be thy message; bid them that they bear “The slave Eudora, to the garden stair, “With one attendant left, prince Andron meets thee there.” XXII. In pride of peril, with a brief adieu, Cosmo received the ring, and thence withdrew;— Passed to the tower which bears the ocean blast, And gave the word to Guiscard as he passed. A kiss of gladness, and one soothing tone, Are given Eudora, and her chief is gone Down the deep windings of the steps of stone. No outward sign that vault must e'er betray;— 'Tis closed upon him, and he strides away: So much of firmness did his step assume, She would not doubt, but still must dread his doom. With ear awake to every sound, she stands, Pale lip, quick pulse, short breath, and clasped hands, And eager head bent downward to the floor; A faint, departing footfall sounds—one more— And all is silence, and a dim delay, And golden moments hurrying on the day; Then a strong arm has smote the yielding wall, And stones fall fast without—she hears them fall. What next the Lady saw, she scarcely knew, Sick with suspense, or dizzy with the view,— A gasping at the heart she felt, of breath Denied,—the film without the rest of death. XXIII. But grappling fast the cords which Guiscard flung, 'Twixt crag and coast, intrepid Andron hung,— So low, he heard the swimming bittern shriek, And felt the salt foam driven upon his cheek; But even in this severe extremity, Hope filled his soul,—he felt that he was free! And bliss was in that momentary date, That dangerous pause, which vigour saved from fate. He nears the summit with a greeting eye;— A moment, and the cords vibrating fly, Loose to the winds, and, in a wild embrace, Guiscard he folds, hiding his weeping face Within his mantle, and his words, though weak, All—all that e'er the heart can utter, speak. XXIV Oh, there was music in the oars' long sweep, Which bore their boat so boldly on the deep! And a stern beauty in each wave that flew By the strong keel, then flashed away in dew! The amplitude of heaven, the stars, the robe Of freedom spread o'er all the glorious globe, The stir of the strong winds, the cry—the call Of Nature in her boundless carnival, Come down upon his heart, and that endue As with a sense electrical and new. But dark emotions mingled, unforgot, And urged him, like an eagle, past the spot. A light is glimmering at the iron gate, And there are slaves, with folded arms, who wait. The guards in silence eyed them as they came, Just bowed in reverence at the emperor's name, Bear from the tower Eudora's fainting weight And idly of the stormy ocean prate. His hand prince Andron to the stranger gave, Then waved his arm and measured back the wave. Long at that gate the mutes remained to gaze, In darkening doubt, and ill-suppressed amaze, And many a legend of remorse and awe From this wild night did Grecian damsels draw Of her who would not o'er the waters flee, And of the armed Phantom of the Sea. XXV. No longer tossed upon the waves of night, 'Tis morn, and ocean smiles again in light; The clouds have vanished ere the stars went down, And heaven's deep figure shows without a frown As in Creation's birth; around, behind, The azure waves are rolled before the wind; There one white sail glides happily and fleet, As speed and sunshine fill the flowing sheet. To them who o'er those freshening billows bound Life, like the sea, is an enchanted round,— A path of rays,—a circle of delight,— All wildly free, and passionately bright;— Too full for speech they sit, and silent eye, Upward, the blue benevolence of sky, Offering their orisons;—and thus they glide, By human eye unknown and undescried, Hour after hour, along the ample tide. Away! away! away! for ever so, Long as the breeze shall urge, the waters flow,— Through noon, through eve, through night, a second day Burns on the wave, but still away, away. The bark flies forward to a barbarous shore, And doubt expires, and danger is no more. XXVI. Long years in Manuel's eye, a restless gloom Was seen to strive, and haunt him to the tomb. And Andron came his kinsman's strife to see, The last strong throe, and mortal agony. And Manuel's crown he wore, and saw the stones Grow grey with years, and darken o'er his bones. Whate'er befel that heart, his own was changed, In roving wide, avenging or avenged. He brought a bride from o'er the heaving main, Yet on his brow were lines,—perchance of pain,— Such they might be! who knew? who knows ev'n now?— They could but see the blackness of his brow. If e'er Eudora's name was named aloud, His look grew gloomy, and his bearing proud: In all beside, gay, versatile, and brave, Free as the wind, and reckless as the wave. END OF CANTO II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ADVERTISMENT. Andronicus, the younger brother of John, son of Isaac, and grandson of Alexius Comnenus, is one of the most conspicuous characters of the age; and his genuine adventures might form the subject of a very singular romance.—Andronicus was arrested, and strictly confined in a tower of the palace of Constantinople. —In this prison he was left above twelve years; a most painful restraint, from which the thirst of action and pleasure perpetually urged him to escape. Alone and pensive, he perceived a hole in a corner of the chamber, and gradually widened the passage, till he had explored a dark and deep recess. Into this hole he conveyed himself, and the remains of his provisions, replaced the bricks in their former positions, and erasing with care the footsteps of his retreat. At the hour of the eustomary visit, his guards were amazed with the silence and solitude of the prison, and reported, with shame and fear, his incomprehensible flight. The gates of the palace and city were instantly shut; the strictest orders were dispatched into the provinces, for the recovery of their fugitive; and his wife, on the suspicion of a pious act, was basely imprisoned in the same tower. At the dead of night, she beheld a spectre: she recognised her husband— Gibbon.—Hist. of the Dec. and F. of the Rom. Emp. Chap. XLVIII.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS. THE RUSSELL Russell's consort, a woman of virtue, daughter and heir of the good earl of Southampton, threw herself at the King's feet, and pleaded with many tears the merits and loyalty of her father, as an atonement for those errors, into which honest, however mistaken principles had seduced her husband. These suppli- cations were the last instance of female weakness, (if they deserve the name), which she betrayed. Finding all applications vain, she collected courage, and not only fortified herself against the fatal blow, but endeavoured by her example to strengthen the resolution of her unfortunate lord. With a tender and decent composure they took leave of each other on the day of his exe- cution. “The bitterness of death is now past,” said he, when he turned from her. Lord Cavendish had lived in the closest inti- macy with Russell, and deserted not his friend in the present calamity. He offered to manage his escape, by changing clothes with him, and remaining at all hazards in his place. Russell refused to save his own life, by an expedient which might expose his friend to so many hardships. When the duke of Monmouth by message offered to surrender himself, if Russell thought that this measure would any wise contribute to his safety; “It will be no advantage to me,” he said, “to have my friends die with me.” As he was the most popular among his own party, so he was the least obnoxious to the opposite faction: and his melancholy fate united every heart, sensible of humanity, in a tender compassion for him.” Hume. Charles II. chap. lxix. “Ô salvar Roma io voglio. Ô perir seco!” Bruto di Alfieri. 1 As o'er some lone and blighted land, Torn from fair freedom's page, Where dwelt the glorious and the grand, The hero and the sage, In pensive pilgrimage we tread,— If pile or pillar o'er the dead Calls back the vanished age, In record to admiring thought The' imperishable names are brought 2 And every name a spell-word is, Of power to kindle higher The patriot's holy energies, The hero's pulse of fire; To quicken with instructive theme, The inspiration and the dream Of him who loves the lyre; And charm with spoils unknown before The heart that swells at wisdom's lore. 3 Turn to where bloom Arabian flowers On Horeb's sainted sod, A glory lingers in the bowers Where erst the Hebrew trod, In whose revealing page we see Time's birth, an angry Deity, The thunder and the rod; Reaps not the sage from name like his High presages of future bliss? 4 Or turn to wisdom's own pure clime, The mother of the free, Whence draw the nations through all time The milk of liberty. O Greece! though long thy life is fled, As nobles to a Princess dead, We bow the adoring knee; Thine, thine indeed are names of light, Time can not dim, nor tyrant blight! 5 Here, should we say, those spirits ranged To whom such spells belong, Who moulded kings, and empires changed; The sightless Homer flung Here, where immortal Ocean smiles, In triumph round her thousand isles, His melody of song; Sweet Sappho there—and here, more dim, Wild Pindar woke his Pythian hymn. 6 Bursting on valour's ardent ear, What millions own'd the charm! Here peal'd the trumpet, there the spear Shook in the couching arm. Go—view Thermopylæ! the pass Yet tells of high Leonidas, Whose ashes there are warm. Corinth—bright thoughts of him hath woke, Who snapt the Syracusan yoke. 7 And Athens, lovely Athens! she Is resonant with One, Who freed from blight her olive tree, And warm'd with freedom's sun, And with Aristogeiton's, rest Thy hallowed name, Harmodius, blest Long as the tide shall run Of flowing time, and with twin ray Grow brighter as your sands decay. 8 To Marathon—to Leuctra go, Where Battle drove his share, And bow thine head, but not in woe, For those who perished there: 'Twas on tiaras that they trod,— And memory sanctifies the sod, And views without despair, The Theban in his latest field, Expire in triumph on his shield. 9 For every drop by freemen shed To other chiefs gave birth, As generous spirits rose to tread In other climes of earth. Lo! thron'd on her imperial hills, How Rome the world's horizon fills With majesty and worth, Whilst live the Gracchi, and her foes Wax pale before her Scipios! 10 But not to Greece—but not to Rome These spells alone belong, Each sod each wave was glory's home, Where honour spurn'd at wrong! Alike the solitudes of Tell, And field where Kosciusko fell, Shall breathe—shall burn in song; And in Iskander's beacon-name, Shall rough Albania start to fame. 11 Nursed in the soil of foreign strife, The Corsic olive grew, For though it gave Napoleon life, It gave Paoli too; Ev'n magic lives in thee, dark Spain, O sweet Alcæus! for a strain Like that thy Lesbos knew! The greenest laurels shouldst thou wear In song, chivalrous Porliere! 12 And, wave-washed Albion! canst Thou boast No column—trophy—stone,— No names to shed around thy coast A glory all thine own? Eyrie of freedom, yes!—her power, In sunniest, as in stormiest hour, With patriots girt thy throne, Who watched with keen and jealous eye. State's giant cloud swim darkly by. 13 It was a sunny hour, when back The exiled Stuart came, Like a young eagle in a track Of peril, fraught with fame. It were enough if his train'd wing, Although it brought no second spring, Had been but free from shame; But 'tis in summer's brightest hour, Gather the plague and thunder-shower 14 He sought not by immediate arts Power's pinnacle to gain; Such grasp suspicious thought imparts, And makes ambition vain; But skill'd the evil to hoodwink, By gradual rivet, gradual link, He forged the iron chain, Whose penal coils were doomed to bind The chartered rights of human-kind. 15 The Magog-sway of State and Law, Twin despots in disguise, The eagle-eye of Freedom saw, And bade her Russell rise. No satellite—no satrap he, To crouch or bend the pliant knee; Firm, self-respecting, wise, He stripp'd away the specious veil: Patriot he rose, and martyr fell. 16 A giddy Court, bribed to betray, And armed to defy, Threw in the sceptre to outweigh Her balanced harmony: Vindictive—studious to debase The curule chair, the civic mace, The people's sovereignty; And with no airy dagger strike At noblest hearts, Tiberius-like. 17 With no wild visionary's heat, But temperate fire, to plan Through doubt, through danger, through defeat, The liberties of man;— To scorn the senate's venal mutes, State's parasites, or prostitutes, Her Russell led the van; Braving, with Sidney at his side, A bigot's wrath,—a tyrant's pride. 18 Too daring souls! ye little knew The treacherous lingered near, With hollow voice and arm untrue, To check your high career; To move in sunshine of your fame, Yet turn to blast each glorious aim;— A Howard or Jaffier, What matters it—the ivies wreathe To leave a murdered trunk beneath. 19 Arraign'd—behold his Lady stand Her pleading lord beside, With shrinking heart, yet aiding hand, The great Southampton's pride. Gentle, but steel'd with fortitude, The waters of her grief subdued,— Unnoticed is their tide; Alas! too deep those waters lie, They chill the heart, not cloud the eye. 20 It soothes to think upon that form Like angel left below, In virtue pure, in friendship warm, And dignified in woe: It soothes—but it were long to tell, How firm, how true, how wise, how well— Her sire upheld—but no— Ingratitude! thy name is king; Will not the cherished yiper sting! 21 And Sophism, in the shape of Law, Skill'd to confound, and wrest Truth in each inference he will draw, Writes Treason on his crest: Age, beauty, birth!—ye vainly sue, His doom has long been fixed—adieu Thou noblest, firmest, best! For vengeance hastes to perpetrate The dire anathema of hate. 22 Cell'd in the fortresses of power, Oh no! I will not dare To think upon the parting hour Which Beauty comes to share: Her agony, love, tenderness, Imploring childhood's last caress Young, innocent, and fair.— Enough! those eyes have looked their last, Enough! “Death's bitterness is past.” 23 And now in marble or a mound, The holy ashes lie Of Him, when girt by danger round, “Who scorn'd to fear or fly:” Patriot! Pole—Roman, Switzer—Greek! Whate'er ye sought below, or seek, There read your homily: It tells—and ages vouch it true, Earth is no home for such as you. 24 But O, ye martyrs! from your bones, Your voices yet are heard; There is a magic in the tones, A spirit in each word: And blood to living veins belongs, Which proudly boils at Russell's wrongs,— So happy! so adored! His name, a beacon of the past, While seasons roll, while planets last. 25 But turn ye to avenging time, To a successive age, And read the moral of the crime In history's tragic page. See the dark mover of the deed, James—to the injured Bedford plead, For aid in civil rage; His fortunes into ruin hurled, The scorn or pity of the world. 26 “Ah, Sir! long years have shed their snow,” The mourning father said, “Upon the tresses of this brow, “And bowed this aged head. “Now in the sunset of my course, “Feeble and withered is my force, “But I had once—to aid, “Or your fallen fortunes to restore, “A Son! but he is now no more!” 27 From sire to rising son bequeathed, Yon Abbey rears its halls, And there hath ready Painting breathed Souls in the silent walls. Touched by the talisman of art, Mourner and mourned to being start;— Here, in her sable palls, Rapt in mute anguish for the dead, Doth Rachel bend her aching head. 28 And hopeless sorrow seems to throw O'er all that speaking face, The white rose of undying woe, A melancholy grace; Warmed with a sunbeam from above Of mingled memory and love, Not ages can erase: Alas! she knows her tears are vain, Yet will not close those springs of pain. 29 And there the Russell's form commands; The Delian with his bow, So looks, so threatens, and so stands, The Python to o'erthrow: Light, colour, attitude, and life, With the cold canvas seem at strife Instinctively, as though Their bright Promethean fire would chide The' unbeating pulse's lingering tide. 30 Long! long, loved images, to you Shall kindred Britons turn, To nature's warm emotions true, To weep, to' adore, to burn— And shoot to Stuart's tyrant rage, That Python of a later age, The arrows of their scorn, Giving to your unuttered wrongs The language of a thousand tongues. 31 Enough! the gladdening sun has set Which poured its beams on you; To you, so bright is our regret, There can be no adieu; None!—whilst from your majestic root One beauteous scion lives to shoot, Ye bud and bloom anew; The sight sad freedom smiles to see, And loves those blossoms as the tree. 32 Of such fair scions One there was, Too beautiful and brief; Time should have broke his scythe and glass, For love of such a leaf: I know not why—the loveliest bloom Is soonest gather'd from the tomb, The earliest plucked by grief; It is as though each element Envied the glorious life it lent. 33 But deeply gazing thus on thee, Thou Picture! I could deem, The blight of his benignity, A nothing, or a dream: Breathing the vital air again, Could deem his spirit walked with men, Unconscious of the stream, Whose darkly-rolling tide at last Ingulfs all present in the past. 34 And but those robes—that youthful play Of colour on his cheek, The triumphs of a later day, Another time bespeak; His eloquent air, Ulysses-like, Wisdom and dignity might strike A gazer for the Greek Of Ithaca, whose voice appals The suitors in his father's halls. 35 Him the hush'd Senate reverenced too; O'er Him, shall History tell, When bannered War his clarion blew, A prophet's mantle fell. He heard, and with presaging sigh, The course of blood and agony Strove vainly to repel; His pitying heart those rites abhorr'd, He loved the olive, not the sword. 36 He would have torn the page of war From England's blazoning book, And bent the gashing scimetar To plenty's pruning-hook; He would have beat the spear and shaft To ploughshares, and the banner-staff Turn'd to the pastoral crook; The groan of millions to the song Of peasants their sweet vales among. 37 He would—but what he would have been, Can hope, can love avow? Death dropped his curtain on the scene, And withered every vow. Where are the vanished Great? declare! The Medici, the Decii, where, Where generous Francis now? Immortal suns in memory's sky— They are not dead, they could not die 38 They came like angels of a night, To disappear by day; As radiant was their earthward flight, As swift to pass away. Too bright, alas! to linger here, They fled—we should not shed one tear For beings blest as they; But evermore exult to find Their living image left behind. 39 Though gone in glory down the sky Our Cynosures decline, If other watch-lights burn on high, 'Tis folly to repine. Look up! in freedom's hemisphere The star of Russell lingers near, And other Pleiads shine, Devoted in the stormiest night To shed round us their guiding light. 40 And, circled thus with names of light, Woburn! I bid thee hail, A beauty rests on every height, A charm in every vale. Peopled with bright remembrances, Green, green on high thy pines arise, Though wintry storms assail, And whisper to the waters near, The dirge which sorrow loves to hear. 41 And of the dead will fancy deem Those shades are vocal still, Their voice upon the murmuring stream, Their footstep on the hill! This solace let not reason chide, That thus the Great, the Glorified Are reproduced at will; For sweet, though sad, is the relief Which brings an anodyne to grief. LINES Written on a blank leaf of the “Pleasures of Hope.” Of power the fond and feeling heart to bless With tenderest joy and sweetest pensiveness, In Love's warm soul to wake a deeper glow, Or kindlier steal a flushing smile from Woe,— Here Campbell lives; his record of renown No fleeting pomp,—a pageant, or a crown! With time's swift tide, they sparkle, charm, and pass; Ionic marble and Corinthian brass Melt into dust; towers, kingdoms, empires fall, As circling ages unto ages call; But all unfelt the withering chill of time, In the fresh flower of a perpetual prime— Here Campbell lives;—here hath his hand designed The fervid transcript of his generous mind. Like that mysterious crystal which inspires Serener pureness from the wrath of fires; The tender charm of his familiar page, Which soothed with softest dreams our earlier age, But breathes, resigned to Art's severe controul, Diviner transport, and a purer soul. When his bold strings, with noblest frenzy fraught, Unchecked by terror, reach the heaven of thought, Seems not his minstrel-spirit to have won The fiery car and mantle of the sun; Wide o'er the burning galaxy to sweep, Span earth's proud planet, and divide the deep, Its springs unlock, and wake with potent spell The angel pity, slumbering in her cell?— Soft as her sigh, the swelling tones subside, Mournful and low, yet warbling as they glide, Soothe the still ear, the' arrested soul enchain, Till bliss is moulded in the mint of pain! O thou! whose path fair Fancy strews with flowers. One lovely tissue of romantic hours,— Whose classic home indulgent Heaven has graced With each blest handmaid in the court of taste! Oft o'er the' enchanting scenes thine art has plann'd Supremely lovely, or divinely grand, Shall Beauty linger, each rude care asleep, Alone with thee to glow or wildly weep; Till thou, enshrin'd within her breast, shalt be The guardian priest of her futurity, Responsive to her voice, bright dreams to weave At opening sunrise and at falling eve. LINES Written beneath a Miniature in the possession of a Friend. 1 Go to! what need of voice or verse Our feelings to pourtray, Whilst, beauty of the Universe! To thee those feelings stray. Thy look of loveliest innocence, Our thrilling pulse, and gaze intense, Have far more power than they— To tell how low our spirit kneels, Our eye admires, and bosom feels. 2 The simple chesnut locks, which Taste Loved far too well to braid, The pearled breast, the cincture chaste, The eye for musing made, The lips like Eve's before her fall, Melting with sweetness,—and o'er all That melancholy shade, Flung like a bridal veil, declare Too much of Angel harboured there: 3 Too much of Angel long to live On earth's contracted span, And these sweet looks of pity give To such a thing as man; The fire that lit thy early years, Attracted by its native spheres, Its rapid race o'erran, And, all transformed to light and love, Shot starlike to the heaven above. 4 Though loving eyes stream fast for thee, I know thou wilt not frown, Nor, freed thyself from pain's decree, On pain look harshly down; Though thine are now Elysian hours, Though heaven with songs, and stars, and flowers, Thy walk of glory crown, This tribute of a moment born, Thou may'st accept, thou wilt not scorn. 5 Why didst thou fade, so fair and young, Ere Autumn seared thy leaf? O, sweets are doubly loved, when flung Abroad by winds of grief! If secret woe thy blossom wrung, There was one beating heart had sprung To bring thine own relief, But ere his love could make it less, Beauty was lost in lifelessness. 6 O! then, when still-surviving Love Grew tearless with his throe, Hope, heralding thy path above, Seemed lost to earth below, And Anguish wished to annihilate His future with a glance of hate, There came a pause in woe— Thou, silent picture of the dead! Smiled on him, and the chaos fled: 7 Fled—for an hour of calmer thought, Fled—for a mournful tear, Which though it flowed that thou wert not, Proved that thou still wert near; That thou wert near to soothe his pain, Bring bliss to his bewildered brain, The assurance to his fear— Whate'er of others, yet that thou Didst love him, and dost love him now. 8 Oh for a spirit's eye to strip The veil that wraps our race, And show in new companionship The parted face to face. This may not be—yet for awhile— So sweetly does this Picture smile, We gaze, and start to trace All that she was on earth, and even Almost what she is now in heaven. THE LEGEND OF THE STATUE. At the entrance of the Temple of the Graces at Woburn Abbey, is an exquisite piece of Sculpture by the celebrated Chantrey, representing his Grace the Duke of Bedford's youngest daughter—Lady Louisa Russell, in the act of pressing a dove to her bosom. 1 Louisa, wandering through the wood, Had caught, one summer noon, a dove, And, blest beyond expression, stood The picture of infantine love. She pressed with Medicéan grace The bird within her snowy arms, And downward bent her sunny face, To kiss away its wild alarms. 2 It was a needless thought! the bird Was far too happy to depart; Finding, by every pulse that stirred, Its warmest nest was on her heart; And he who chanced that girl to see So fendly smoothe each ruffled feather, Wished that the turtle-dove and she Thus, ever thus, might dwell together. 3 The Sculptor heard that wish of his, And by a magic of his own, Re-echoed back the parent's bliss, And fixed the lovely twins in stone. The statue cannot speak her power, The mild bird raise its sculptured wings, Yet, stamped in taste's divinest hour, We half misdeem them living things. 4 A ray is in her smile, her eye— It cannot be the beam that falls From the sun's figure in the sky,— Without are bowers, around are walls; Yet brightness radiates round the stone, Sincere as e'er to feeling rushed, And sweetness seems in every tone Late uttered—though the voice is hushed. 5 In that serenely-speaking smile, We live our childhood o'er again, But sadness chills our cheek the while, To think we cannot feel as then: When youth's full fire is in our eyes, We steal from Venus' car a turtle, And nestle—who would not? the prize On glowing hearts with chains of myrtle. 6 But of the many, cherished thus, How few, fond girl! like thine remain, Nor, home returning, leave to us, Chilled heart, dark throe, and vacant chain! But thou, in life's young loveliness, From age to age as now shalt stand, Smiling with transport so to press Love's turtle with thy little hand. 7 Fit guardian of so fair a shrine! The loveliest of those Graces three May well like thee her head decline,— Thou art herself in infancy. But when few summer-suns make ripe This flower which glads the parent-stem, Statue! thy living prototype Shall burst to bloom, and charm like them. To— With a Seal bearing the Inscription “CON TE SONO.” 1 We came—we met—we looked—we parted; To one, at least, with some regret, And both perhaps were heavier-hearted, Than if our eyes had never met. Then, Lady! let the seal I send Sometimes revive a thought of me, It speaks the feeling of a friend, “Though absent, I am still with thee.” 2 Years pass, and with them sweep along The forms we love, the loves we feel, And absence deals oblivious wrong, And friendship mourns declining zeal. O, then how sweet the heart to find Which spite of veering time's decree, In the fixt fondness of the mind, Declares—“indeed I'm still with thee.” 3 The sweetest leaf, the sunniest flower, Must bear the rude winds of the year; So fondest hearts in angry hour, May oft be thought most insincere. But well may dark mistrust rejoice When blighted seems its cherished tree, To hear from far this still small voice, Ia'm still with thee, I'm still with thee.” 4 I nurse the vain, but grateful thought, That thy remembered hand shall press, In fondest hours, what mine has wrought— Spell of appealing tenderness. To claim myself, of many such, But one—I know can never be; Yet, when this sigil feels thy touch, Remember, “I am then with thee.” 5 In hope, regret, joy, doubt, surprize,— Whate'er thou feel'st, or think'st, or grievest, Thy smile of lips, thy light of eyes, The tears thou shed'st, the praise thou givest; Of all fond friendship sends away, Shall this the happy witness be, And ever say, or seem to say, In all, through all, “I'm still with thee.” 6 Whilst I—recal (if once forgot) The whiteness of thy soul and brow, And feel there's sweetness in my lot, To think on such an one as thou: But Memory's calm reflecting ray Can never, never darkened be; For still in soul though far away, “I am with thee, I am with thee!” AFTER THE SPANISH. 1 Sweet maid! I leaned in life's young bloom, Upon a spirit warm as thine, And dreamt, how could I dream its doom Would ever so respond to mine? Trembling, I touched my light guitar, As now—to please her listening ear, And thought, how could I think the star Of love in her dark eye sincere? 2 I flung my holiest rosary Around her neck, the white veil under, And thought the beads would ever be By other hands unbroke asunder. I gave as flourishing a leaf As those which thy white roses shade, And giving, said, “I'm sure no thief Will e'er my blossomed flowers invade.” 3 But song—flowers—rosary—all are gone! The ear that listened, lips that prais'd! And of my many hopes, not one But perished in the flame they rais'd. Gifts, long refused, I oft could see She took with smiles, but now 'tis plain These were not given in pain for me, But pride of power in giving pain. 4 I wish that thou indeed wert she By whom those early smiles were given, For then, I know, from pleasure's tree My young buds had not all been riven. For kind and mild thy spirit is, And holy are the tears thou givest, And oh! 'tis something near to bliss, To know that 'tis for me thou grievest. 5 But dry those dear, subduing eyes, Or stormier grief will gush from mine, Yet, when away, my heart will prize Each drop that overflows from thine. Not when away, not when away, Oh no! I could not bear to see The tender sentiment decay That speaks of sympathy from thee. 6 But we must part, and I must pass To mingle with the crowd again, And strive, in hollow mirth, alas— How vainly! to forget my pain. But shunned or sought, in smiles or tears, Howe'er my soul may droop and pine, 'Twill half be happy, since it bears, Dear maid! the thrilling stamp of thine. “Et longum, formose, vale! vale! inquit Iola.”—Virgil. 1 This scorn of all the glorious stir Which sunshine brings to morn,— This darkening upon flower and fir, These lonely hours—all, all concur To tell that thou art gone! 2 The night that falls on Memory's brain, In slumbers sad, but dear; A lightless lamp—a severed chain, Are all of thee that now remain To tell that thou wert here. 3 Although the links could disunite, The lamp in crystals break,— Their very fragments have the light Of stars, and I in fortune's spite Will gaze—though all forsake. 4 The fond farewell to others given, I envy not you gave; The same to me accorded, even Although my very soul had striven, Had made that soul a slave. 5 Thy one last glance to one unknown, Enough suffices me; A smile or two—a tender tone Fading in music, serve alone For Memory's reverie. 6 She shall not let the lightest thing That breathes of thee decline; No! sad or happy, she shall cling, Like bees upon the flower of spring, To each dear leaf of thine! I took the Harp. 1 I took the harp, and would have sung, But scarcely had its tones awoke, When lo! a chord too harshly strung, Beneath my fingers, sighing, broke. 2 'Tis thus the heart of gentle mould To love, alas, too fondly given, Ere it can well its tale unfold, By Beauty's careless touch is riven. 3 And when its sweetest thrill is o'er, And it has ceased to throb for ever, Can kindliest smiles its pulse restore, Or warm it then?—no, never! never! 4 Then, Lady, whilst that heart's awake Which beats for thee, and thee alone, Remember that its chords will break, If with rude hand they're dwelt upon. Written in an Album. 1 Oh, I could whisper thee a tale That surely would thy pity move, But lightly would the lips avail To shadow forth the soul's deep love. 2 To tell that tale my pen were weak, My tongue the office too denies, Then mark it on my varying cheek, And read it in my silent eyes. Sonnet to W. Wordsworth, Esq. With thee, divine Philosopher, I gazed Upon the mighty hills at dying day: The prodigal elements around us lay Rock'd like a babe to slumber; the sky blazed, Rich with vermilion fires, whose hue embraced Woods, rocks,—the lake in its romantic pride,— And then a flying sunbeam we descried Brightening up half the valley: Night erased Too soon the' expressive picture, but my heart Locked it as in the casket of sweet thought, Sacred to future fancy. Hast thou part In the fine dream, or is it all forgot? Oft on the fairy Spectacle I brood, The flowers, the hills return—vale—water—wood— And thou—the beautiful Genius of the spot. To? The rose and vestal snowdrop, Lovely One! Gathered by thee, within my whitest book Lie like a charm; how much I love to look On them thou shalt not know: let the proud Sun, Swift journeyer in a withering circlet, run His race of ruin—he shall never steal One passionate memory which these gifts reveal Of pleasant hours by-gone from us—not one! Thy locks, thy music-making lips, thine eyes, (Starry inquisitors) and, yet more fair, The sunshine of thy delicate spirit lies Warm on my heart, and makes Elysium there. Sometimes cross Thou my wood-walks by surprise, Wearing the Grecian Hebe's smiling air. Taliessin. Lovely the ascent has been, though in the face Of giant hills; the hooded Twilight now, Darkens their summits, and I stand where Thou Ancestral Harper of our ancient race, High Taliessin! hadst thy dwelling-place, A mountain-throne. Oh grand, oh glorious spot! Speak, mighty Elements! have ye forgot His numbers! does your heart preserve a trace Of that old British music? Hark! the Lake, The Druid waves of sunlit Geirionedd Make answer far into the hills, and break Their sleep of centuries;—with awe I tread; His eye seems on me in that star, whose flake Falls, like a tongue of fire upon my head. The Cascade on Raven Crag, near Lake Coniston. Pure Virgin of these Alps! who lov'st to wear Thy foam around thee as a bridal vest, And from these stormy heights dost seek the rest Which yon blue vale and glassy sea prepare— Now scattering on the winds thy silver hair, Giving fresh greenness to the moorland moss,— Now fretting unambitiously across The ancient stones, filling the amorous air With music: gazing upon thee I think Of Her, the young, the modest, and the wise, Who often sang beside thy verdant brink, In shepherd's ear the Songs of Paradise. Of thee, pellucid Fountain, I will drink, So thou inspire me with like melodies. Newstead Abbey. I plucked a bluebell from thy crumbling wall, Proud Pile of proud Antiquity in tears! Who, yet indignant at the conquering years, Sitt'st frowning in thy wild monastic pall On ruin, and to one lone waterfall Mournest thy wrongs. Pale Princess! raise thy head The planet of thy splendour is not fled, A Voice has gone from forth thy desolate hall A musical and melancholy voice, Making the Years thy vassals; crowning thee, Ev'n in thy dust and ashes as the choice, The high-born bride of Immortality. Thousand enamoured Pilgrims shall rejoice To come, and cull thy glorious weeds, like me. FINIS.</field>
