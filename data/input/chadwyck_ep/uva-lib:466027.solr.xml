      <field name="fulltext">IN A GARDEN I. [What is the world trying to say?] What is the world trying to say? Why is the light so tender and grey— Why are the tremulous leaves a-sway On the trees new fledge with the faintest green? Nay, he were wise who could say what these things mean, and tell the secret of May. What is my heart trying to say? Why does it tremble and hurry and stay At the sight of a leaf on a sunny day, Of a leaf tho' never so delicate-green? Nay, he were wise who could say what these things mean, and tell the secret of May. II. [You came, the vernal equinox] You came, the vernal equinox Brought on the solstice in a day; Crocuses in their beds of box Straight changed to tulips, striped and gay. You went, and summer fled with you; 'Twas autumn, nay 'twas winter here; Cold winds drove snow-clouds up the blue And bared the disenchanted year. Idly I mourn, or idly go Thro' all the wan dishevelled place, In hope some one red rose may blow The harbinger of your sweet face. III. [Green leaves panting for joy with the great wind rushing through] Green leaves panting for joy with the great wind rushing through: A burst of the sun from cloud and a sparkle on valley and hill, Gold on the corn, and red on the poppy, and on the rill Silver, and over all white clouds afloat in the blue. Swallows that dark, a lark unseen, innumerous song Chirruped and twittered, a lowing of cows in the meadow grass, Murmuring gnats, and bees that suck their honey and pass: God is alive, and at work in the world:—we did it wrong. Human eyes, and human hands, and a human face Darkly beheld before in a vision, not understood:— Do I at last begin to feel as I stand and gaze Why God waited for this, then called the world very good? IV. [Sick and sullen and sad the slow days go] Sick and sullen and sad the slow days go; Fog creeps over the land, and frost and snow Grip on the springs of joy and stop their flow. Yet at thy voice, beloved, the ice to-day Felt the ardours of Spring, and fell away, Bubbled again and sang with the joy of May. V. [May-month is dawning] May-month is dawning, May-month so fair and fleet, The white thorn blossoms Around my lady's bower; Golden the cowslips Are springing round her feet; But ev'n the violet Is not so sweet a flower. VI. [O faithless heart, for once, for once believe] O faithless heart, for once, for once believe: Open thine eyes, can seeing then deceive? O hopeless thirst—for once, for once drink deep; Look! joy's full cup is given thee, tho' thou sleep. O loveless life, break forth and bud; thy rod Shall bear sweet almonds from the graft of God. O stammering tongue, for once, for once speak true: To-day you plight the troth she giveth you. VII. [Roses white and pink and red] Roses white and pink and red Who this dewy evening shed Round our path a faint perfume:— 'Tis my love that thus you greet, Deigning sweets to one as sweet From your close-locked treasure-room. Let not spikenard make pretence, Odorous gums that drug the sense, Balm or musk to vie with this: Not the spices for the Spouse Heaped in her Beloved's house, Cinnamon and ambergris. Roses white and pink and red Whose dim petals thickly spread Carpet o'er the shaven grass; Could you know—her feet are fair And as soft as rose-leaves are, Kiss them lightly as they pass. VIII. [What sound is that borne on the breeze] He. What sound is that borne on the breeze, From what heart-thrilling strain, Out of the glowing depth of emerald trees, Just heard, then lost again? She. It was the nightingale, whose fervent heart Thus meditates his part While his bride tarries; or to guide er beauty to his side. He. He is the true interpreter of love. For who that listens to his lay In covert hid from the unaccustomed sun This warm spring day, Knows if that passion be or glad or sad, If pain or joy his numbers move; 'Tis hope, nay 'tis despair, nay rapture mad, Nay all of these in one. She. Stretch hither then, dear bird, thy tawny wing; To our lone garden come and sing In thy deep-throated way The love we cannot say. He. Yet come not at high noon, Come when the silver moon Lights up the chestnut tapers, and broad lamps Of the white, spreaded rose; And makes the luminous pinks and lustrous may Fairer than ere by day; And the deep stillness grows Deeper, the spell more deep; No sound save in the stall an ox that champs, Or disturbed, scampering sheep. IX. [When first I loved, 'twas not your eyes] “Dixit et avertens.” When first I loved, 'twas not your eyes That quenched ambition in despair: Or eyelids folding petal-wise: Or golden burnish in brown hair: Or ebb and flow of red and white: Tho' now I taste their full delight. 'Twas in this lovely garden first I saw your loveliness displayed; You sat; my heart was high, and durst Sit by you wondering, undismay'd; You rose: my heart fell on its face And knew the Genius of the place. So not by any common sign, Ambrosial hair, or roseate hue, That witnesses to race divine, Troy's prince his goddess mother knew; But when she turned her steps, “'Tis thou, Venus, I knew thee not till now.” X. [In the eaves a swallow cri'th] In the eaves a swallow cri'th, And hark, the sound of whetting, Whetting and whetting the scythe On the dewy lawn: O blithe, Blithe sound, there's no forgetting. For the grass is mown to-day; O delicate scent and sweet! Sweeter than seeded hay, More sweet, and ah, more fleet! It is blown, it is flown away. XI. [In all my borders I my true love seek] In all my borders I my true love seek By flowery signs to set: Praising the rose-carnation for her cheek, Her hair the violet; Flowers that with sweet returns each season bloom, As each its impulse wakes, Making air fragrant with a purple gloom, Or whorl of crimson flakes. And ye, who blanch your glow, violets more rare, Carnations, foam of light; Be pledges of a beauty still more fair When hair and cheek are white. XII. [Dearest, these household cares remit] Dearest, these household cares remit; And while the sky is blue to-day, Here in this sunny shelter sit, To list the blackbird's lay. Is all so rare, romantic boy? Is love so new and strange, that thou Must with that wild and shrilling joy Thrill the yet wintry bough? Ah, now 'tis softer grown, more sweet,— “I come, I come, O love, O my love,”— And he is fluttering to her feet In yonder purple grove. Now hark! all summer swells the note And dreams of mellow ripeness make So ripe, so rich his warbling throat For spouse and children's sake. Lover and prophet, see! the flower Of cherry is hardly white, and figs Are leafless, and thy nuptial bower A cage of rattling twigs. Yet faith is evidence, and hope Substance, and love sufficient fire; And Art in these finds ampler scope Than in fulfilled desire. So play thy Pan's pipe, happy Faun, Till some May night with moonshine pale, Thou pin'st, to hear by wood or lawn Apollo's nightingale. XIII. [Thro' the open windows come] Thro' the open windows come, Thro' the heated summer air Where the notes of birds are dumb, Moanings of a deep despair. And the listener, on the lawn Digging plantains, holds his breath; For he knows the lists are drawn In a strife 'twixt life and death. Half his song the blackbird tries, Stops again for utter drouth; So the sun thro' shadeless skies Shoots his arrows from the south: But that quiet moan comes yet, Chokes the heart of one who hears With vain longing, vain regret, Till his soul throbs in his ears. Slow the hours go creeping by, Yet the weary moan is sore; Sudden then the wailing cry Of a voice unknown before Pierces thro' it. Oh delight! Heart rejoice, tears have your way, Praised be God in depth and height For the child that's born to-day! XIV. [With dreams the sunbeams steep] With dreams the sunbeams steep My bower that a bower will be In a month, for March this year Is kind as the month of maying: And a sound of the sea brings sleep; Nay, sleep brings a sound of the sea, For it is but the wind that I hear In the heavy fir-tree swaying. What hear you as you stand, O love, by the shore of the sea? The surf, or the gull's sad cry, Or the shouts of children playing? Nay, shouts from a far-off land, And a plover's cry on the lea, And the sough of the winds that sigh In the heavy fir-tree swaying. XV. ['Tis April, but the drought of March] 'Tis April, but the drought of March Is not yet piercèd by sweet showers; The unsheathed sunbeams smite and parch The springing grass, the o'erhasting flowers. Our lily of the valley, see, That hardly ripens for Mid-May, My love's first pledge and annual fee, Is blown a month before the day. The lawn grows rusty, dusty red, For tho' all night the gracious dew Bathes each wan blade, that else were dead, It cannot their dried sap renew. But in the orchard is a place Where we may lie, and feel the fall Of apple-petals on our face, And drowsing hear the cuckoo's call, The ring-dove's melancholy note, The blackbirds fluting, and the hum Of bees above us, more remote, As slumber steals our senses. Come. XVI. [O happy garden, in May air] O happy garden, in May air With lawns and wilding arbours fair And alleys pleached of quick and yew To cloister those from curious view Who tread their paths of springing green; And, save of nesting birds unseen, Listen and tell of love as they, While youth is youth and May is May. Take hands and walk, as we walk'd then Through the long shade to sun again, And watch'd the dial silently Brood o'er his lighten'd hours (as we, After our many days of cloud;) And heard the blackbird fluting loud Fantastic descant from the beech, Then speed him home with chattering screech. We laughed, “Shy artist, who's thy foe?” Nor knew the dread that parents know. From the nigh copse a turtle-dove Pour'd forth his passionate tale of love In smothered sobs from too full heart; We heard in trance our own love's smart. Then all the breadth of heaven's high hall Shook with the plaintive cuckoo's call, Now faint, now resonantly clear, Then faint again, as far or near His homeless home he wander'd free, A “Pilgrim of Eternity.” The spell broke with the smile, and so We turn'd our steps and loiter'd slow 'Twixt borders pale with later spring;— Polyanthus crowding ring on ring, Love's banner, heartsease, balm for thought, White tulips, blue forget-me-not. One slim narcissus drooped his head, And from her closely curtain'd bed One lily shook out half her bells; Each pluck'd; which kept? the rhyme not tells. As yet the wise respective world Had not her pomp of plumes unfurl'd Or tassell'd gold on tree and tree, T' enhance their fresh embroidery. For Boreas bluster'd still, and th' East Palsied the sap in plant and beast. Only Pomona knew no fear For her white breast had brush'd the pear, And now her fingers 'gan to fling On th' apples pink enamelling. (O frosts, join not with rain to mar More cunning workmanship than far Ind fashions by her delicate waves To deck the Nereids in dim caves!) The season strain'd forward, and we Strain'd forward ampler bliss to see— Summer for spring, for blossom fruit; And we have tasted,—and shall do't, If God allow, not once again— Autumn's joy wrought from smiles and pain. And now once more 'tis May—once more June's breath stirs rapture, blown before Her footsteps, and the rose's blood Tingles, the ruby gems i' th' wood Leap into twisted leaves, unfold To spray, as one but cries “Behold!” And in the spray's heart lurks—O June, O heart of the year, thy heart makes swoon Th' o'erquicken'd sense, but ev'n thy name Wakes on man's heart new wings of flame! O happy garden, two long years Have all thy voices charm'd our ears From discord, din, and rough unrest That drive off peace, too timorous guest. The ever-circling years shall bring Thee but more beautiful a spring; (More beauteous spring, O love, to thee) In spite of winter's jealousy! Which of us twain shall sooner go The separate path; ah, who can know! One May perhaps while thrushes call On Love in sweet antiphonal, An air shall blow, a whisper'd sigh; And one the other sitting by Shall rise and quit this leafy place With backward hands, and what still face! Nay, tears avail not, but our love Avails death's terror to remove. Love dies not nor can lovers die; And though vast worlds between them lie, Th' intelligencing current thrills From each to each the thought love wills. Remember'st not the dreary day When I must journey, how (you say) A nightingale, ev'n love's own bird, In our fair garden else unheard, Pour'd from the lilac, melting-sweet, His throated jewels at your feet, Till blissful night return'd me home; And is death more than absence? Come Leave care, 'tis May, and still we are here, And shall be, shall be, many a year, Hearkening these swallows, and without The struck ball, and the echoing shout Of village children at their play, In the quiet air at end of day. XVII. [Rose and lily, white and red] “Here's a few flowres, but 'bout midnight more, The herbs that have on them cold dew o' the night.” Rose and lily, white and red, From my garden garlanded, These I brought and thought to grace The perfection of thy face. Other roses, pink and pale, Lilies of another vale, Thou hast bound around thy head In the garden of the dead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SONGS AND SONNETS BARBARA The breeze of Spring is not so blithe, The sea-gull not so free, No silver fish so light and lithe To wind in the green sea. Nor e'er did subtle alchemist Compound such wondrous dyes Of sapphire sky and emerald mist As the hue of Barbara's eyes. The wind goes wavering thro' the grass, The sea-gull circles high, The golden sunbeams in a mass Break from a rift of sky. But I may bind the wind as well, Or scale the gull's high nest, As ever hope the gold to tell That flows round Barbara's breast. ACCIDIA There breathes a sense of Spring in the boon air: The woods are amber, purple, misty red, Primrose and violet rouse them from their bed, Their skiey homes the patient rooks repair; Everywhere hope is rife, joy everywhere; But I thy heart lie yet unquickenèd, And bleating lambs and larks that sing o'erhead Charm not away my sluggish cold despair. Peace, peace, fond heart; thy spring-tide is not this; Thy sap of joy mounted, though flowers were sere, That day, though leaves fell thick before the West. Nor grudge nor envy thou a natural bliss. Birds keep their season, thou through all the year May'st sing thy song, soar skyward, make thy nest. LOVE THE MASKER (Anacreontic) I. On a summer day, Under leaves for sky, Stretched at ease we lay. When the heat gan die, When the light grew mild, Came there wandering by, O, a lovely child, Fair as the Winged Boy, Came and looked and smiled. “Stay, here's many a toy, Child, whoe'er you be.” Said he, “I am Joy.” So he stayed, and we Crowned his hair with buds, Bent and bowed the knee, Brought him Summer's goods Made him king for play In the leafy woods. “Now, child, home away, We have kept you long.” But the child would stay. “Sing then one last song, Sing and go,” we said, “Night may do you wrong.” Then we kissed the red Darling lips, and he Homeward wandered. II. On a winter's night When the storm was o'er And the snow lay white, I unlatched the door, Drawn to watch the moon Shining keen and frore. There upon the stone Crouched a child, behold! Sleeping or in swoon. Ah, his face was cold, Pinched and wan and thin 'Neath his hair of gold. “Chafing heat may win; Quick, or the child dies.” So we chafed his skin; Till with many sighs Th' eyelids opened, Then we saw his eyes. “O, sweet Joy,” we said, “O our summer king, Thou wert all but dead. Say what luckless thing Drove thee thro' the snow, Hither wandering?” “Nay, my name is Woe,” Said the child, “nor where Am I, do I know, Nor who pay me care: But I must away, On my journey fare.” “Nay, our darling, nay, Whatso thy name be, Hither didst thou stray; We have longed for thee, We have found and saved; Ours thou art, agree.” But his gold locks waved As he shook his head, Laughed, and echoed “saved”! Then his wings light-spread Beat, and he was gone, And we worshipped. LOVE AND DUTY O blue eyes, bright with sapphire blaze, Dear mantling cheek, a ruby fire, My eyes, 'tis, light the light I praise, Your cheek on mine that flushes higher. Ah, could these fires their force sustain, Each draw from each and find no loss— Nay, waxing as the pulses wane Reforge the heart and purge its dross! Think it not; all things slide away; Nor can love's light and heat abide, Tho' eyes on eyes be fixed alway, And cheek be ever cheek beside. Yet if that star, of many one, Which blazes stedfast o'er our head, Lead up our eyes, as each day's done, And thro' our eyes its influence shed, Till thro' our hearts there flows with peace Of equal pulse the same desire,— Then eyes and cheeks shall never cease To glow and feed each other's fire. LOCA SENTA SITU The rushes stand where the rushes stood, Stiff and tall, but the lake is dry; They will stand so still in the lonely wood, Till the world shall die. No wind makes rustle the weary reeds; The gentle gale and the rushing blast As they follow where spring or the storm-king leads, Pause aghast. The red sun flames with a steady light, No smallest cloud in the brazen skies; The moon looks down with a pale affright In her quiet eyes. No song of bird can now come near, No buzz of insect ever again, No ripple of pleasant water, or tear Of the dripping rain. The reeds stand now where the reeds then stood, Above them hangs the silent sky; Around them shivers the lonely wood, And the lake is dry. SONG [Is this the spring that wanders] Is this the spring that wanders With sad and wistful eyes, And idly inly ponders The grey and vacant skies? Is this true spring or seeming That sits with sunken head? O yes, for she is dreaming Of winter that is dead. Is this the spring that quickens The violets in the vale, And all the woodland thickens With primrose-blossoms pale? Is this true spring or seeming That smiles along the way? O yes, for she is dreaming Of laughter of the May. WHISPERS AT COURT October I Come away, away, Summer at length is sped. Was ever a King so gay? And now he lieth dead. Kiss we his brother's hand, Who reigns in the Southern land. II Stay and see, and see; Summer was glorious, But gorgeous pageantry Doth little profit us. His Queen (if truth be told) Will scatter abroad his gold. November I Come now, O come, Autumn her gold hath spent; And through the palace doth roam Moaning her discontent. Her voice is shrill and drear, A weariness to hear. II Stay yet, O stay, Winter will reign to-night. Did you not mark to-day His bitter smile in her sight? He hath a plot, I ween, To carry captive the Queen. AVE ATQUE VALE The beech has fallen in the gale, The gentle beech we loved so long. Alas, could wintry winds avail To work such envious wrong! No more shall April make thee brave With silken leaves, nor e'er again Thy streaming tresses toss and wave Flashing their gems of rain; While haply sheltering boy or maid Looks startled up, and deems he sees The green, pale light thro' roofs of jade In fairy palaces. No more shall mavis to his mate Warble, or gossip sparrows cheep In thy loved bowers, or jackdaws prate On caucus matters deep; Or sweet May's bird his mystery ply Cutting smooth jewels of ringing song, To grace with trembling ecstasy Night's ear, that waited long. Who planted thee, I know; and praise His ghost, and here within my hall (That once was his,) have set his face, For a memorial;— A stately priest with powdered hair, In cassock trim and decent bands; My fancy sees him fix thee there With tender, fostering hands. Goodbye; low lying at my feet I hail, I wail thee as my sire, And with due rites and dirges meet Will light thy funeral pyre. TO THE NIGHTINGALE IN SEPTEMBER (Villanelle) Child of the muses and the moon, O nightingale, return and sing, Thy song is over all too soon. Let not night's quire yield place to noon, To this red breast thy tawny wing, Child of the muses and the moon. Sing us once more the old sad tune Pandion heard when he was king, Thy song is over all too soon. Night after night thro' leafy June The stars were hush'd and listening, Child of the muses and the moon. Now new moons grow to plenilune And wane, but no new music bring, Thy song is over all too soon. Ah, thou art weary! well, sleep on, Sleep till the sun brings back the Spring; Thy song is over all too soon, Child of the muses and the moon. NIDDERDALE Two things I love in this most lovely dale: A stream of amber water, clear and chill, O'er slope stones slipping, or at wayward will Breaking smooth silence to a silver tale; A fir-wood then, fanned by a gentle gale To loose its scent; within the trunks are still, And pillar a dark shrine for dreams to fill; Between the stems the unsunned grass is pale. Two things I loved; but thou, O lovelier Than these, hast all that these were worth to me; Thy clearer eyes know more of change and stir Than all the brooks, thy tongue more melody; And 'neath thy shadowy hair, thy serene face Makes sanctuary in the holy place. GOING DOWN HILL ON A BICYCLE A Boy's Song With lifted feet, hands still, I am poised, and down the hill Dart, with heedful mind; The air goes by in a wind. Swifter and yet more swift, Till the heart, with a mighty lift, Makes the lungs laugh, the throat cry:— “O bird, see; see, bird, I fly. Is this, is this your joy, O bird, then I, though a boy, For a golden moment share Your feathery life in air!” Say, heart, is there aught like this In a world that is full of bliss? 'Tis more than skating, bound Steel-shod to the level ground. Speed slackens now, I float Awhile in my airy boat; Till when the wheels scarce crawl, My feet to the treadles fall. Alas, that the longest hill Must end in a vale; but still, Who climbs with toil, wheresoe'er, Shall find wings waiting there. NATURAL HERALDRY The rain is over, that so long Has chilled the tender-hearted May; Chaffinch and thrush resume their song: Come, children, come: come out to play; Leave crests and shields, and con with me A still more antique heraldry. See, in a field of azure sky, Whose tincture glows without a stain, Mid argent clouds dispersedly The sun in splendour shines again; While of them both i.e., of argent and azure. the fountains flow In barry-wavy streams below. Here on a mount are fir and beech, And counterchanged by every breeze Leaves of all foils; and flowers each Proper, in chief the fleur-de-lis; And look where barbed and seeded blows Argent and gules the rival rose. Two-headed eagles are not here, Or crested peacocks in their pride, But two-legged martlets build, and steer With wings displayed their circles wide; And emulate with grub and fly Your pelican in her piety. In this field vert, parted per pale, No lion ramps or gryphon prances But Dobbin whisks a coupèd tail, And Meg as salient as a lance is; And what supporter could surpass Lucius, our sturdy golden ass? SOME FLOWERS Poets sing you fancies About Love and Death, Night and Day. Do not give them pansies; “That's for thoughts,” one saith: Give them bay. If the soldier's quarrel Be for right, not might, God and King, Let them bind the laurel Round his brows at night, Glorying. For the lover roses, Roses for his love, Till they die; When the churchyard closes O'er them, strew above Rosemary. For the parson rueful, Herb of grace, not sense, Here is rue; Let the sleepy pewful, With a difference, Wear it too. TRIOLET Under the sun There's nothing new; Poem or pun, Under the sun, Said Solomon, And he said true, Under the sun There's nothing new.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">RELIGIOUS PIECES THE TREE OF LIFE A Recognition in four Seasons Argument A prophet, desiring to recover for men the fruit of the Tree of Life, seems to find Paradise by certain traditional signs of beauty in nature. He is further persuaded by observing the beauty and innocence of children. By and by he comes upon the Tree of Knowledge, whose fruit, now old, he discerns to be evil; but from which, to his desire, new is brought forth, which is good. At each recognition one of the Guardian Angels of the Tree of Life is withdrawn, until there is left only the Angel of Death, in the light of whose sword he perceives it. The Angels' songs are not heard by the prophet. I. Spring Prophet O tree of life, blissful tree, Old as the world, still springing green, Planted, watered by God; whose fruit Hath year by year fallen about the root, And century by century; Grant me that I thy glory unseen At last attain to see! Chorus of Angels The flame of our eyes still hideth The fatal tree: Which God in charge confideth That none may see, Till 'gainst our light advances A purer ray, And melts with fervid glances Our swords of day. Prophet Considerate lilia agri quomodo crescunt.This garden I consider: if not the wise Repute it Paradise, The wise may err and ancient fame be lost; As Ophir on the swart Arabian coast,— Whence she, of Saba queen, In silk raiment and gold, Bearing spices manifold, Not unlike this lily's purer sheen, Came a weary way to salute Solomon, Fainting to see, and fainted having seen Such wisdom dazzled from his throne,— Now Ophir lies unknown; Yet stumbling haply on gold, a man shall say Who feeds his flocks by the well, “Lo Ophir!” what if I to-day A like token recover, and tell. Chorus of Angels The fire of our heart presages (And gins to dim,) That though through ageless ages We wait for him, He comes; our glory retires, And shrinks from strife, Folding in closer fires The Tree of Life. Prophet Goeth up a mist, To water the ground from the four streams at even; Wrapt in a veil of amethyst The trees and thickets wait for Spring to appear, An angel out of heaven, Bringing apparel new for the new year; In the soft light the birds Reset to the loved air the eternal words, And in the woods primroses peer. Angel of the Spring He hath seen me with eyes of wonder And named my name, My shield is riven in sunder, And quencht my flame: My task is done, and rewarded, If faithfully; By others now is guarded The mystic tree. II. Summer Prophet O tree of life, blessed tree, When shall I thy beauty attain to see? New fledged ev'n now, new canopied with green, (Not darkening ever as these in brooding heat,) To beasts of the field a screen, A shadowy bower for weary eyes and feet: Tree by tree musing, I find not thee. Sinit parvulos, &amp;c.See, in the rippling water the children at play, Flashing hither and thither, diamonded with spray; Lithe and fair their limbs, their hearts light and gay— As fair as they of Niobe; Divinely fair, but too divinely famed; Not so now let it be. Children of Adam these by birth proclaimed, Clasping a mother's breast, a father's knee, By father's father named. Ay, but see, but see, Their mien how high, how free their spirit! They are naked and not ashamed Of that translucent veil, that symmetry. How they shout for glee! It is the primal joy, and not the curse they inherit. A child of Adam, a child of God can he be? O look, look and see! The Angels of Children His ear through nature's noises, Where'er he trod, Could hear in the children's voices The praise of God. Our task is done, and rewarded, If faithfully, By others now is guarded The mystic tree. III. Autumn Prophet Say who are ye upon this bank reclining, At random laid, Where loaded boughs a diaper intertwining Of fragrant shade, Stretch down their fruits to cheer the heart's repining. Dicit enim Vetus melius est.They hear me not, asleep, or drunken, or (ah!) dead. O Tree of Knowledge, 'tis thou, tree divine Of good and ill;—trembling, I view thee. To me, as them, thy golden apples incline, Able to slake my thirst, or else undo me. Which shall I pluck, which dread Of all their goodlihead? If roots be twain, from which there flows To these elixir, poison to those, How can I track their currents through the stem Which bears and buries them? Nay, but it cannot be the tree of good; 'Tis utter evil; to nearer view The fruit dislustres, dull of hue, All its ripe vermilion vanished, Dead fruit, not human food; And these mistaking souls from life are banished. But see,—a wonder,—lo, on each branch swells A new fruit ruddy-rinded, that smells Freshly, and from their places in decay The old shrivel, and drop away. The ripeness allures to taste, O what should stay me? Ill was the old, but the new is goodly and sweet; A blessing is in it, desire to greet, Not a curse to slay me; (O divine the taste!) Of the blind to open the eyes, Deaf ears to unstop, make wise The feeble-hearted, and to-day (O haste!) For these poor dead the tree of life display! Angel of the Tree of Divine Knowledge The old fruit which evil bringeth He hath eschewed; I breathe, and a new fruit springeth; He saw it good. My task is done; and rewarded, If faithfully; By others now is guarded The mystic Tree. IV. Winter Prophet I had thought ere this to have blest mine eyes With thy vision benign, immortal tree; For since that fruit, more than with Euphrasy, My spirits are all alert, my sense more keen. Nor is the north that chides with the stript boughs An enemy, if it shows All these but mortal, though in Paradise. But thou, O still unseen, Come into sight; not yet I faint, but abide And ever abide, yearning thee to behold. Thee following, this girdling forest wide, My heart by hope made bold, I have laboured through, and now emerge at length Torn by the briers, spent my strength; But branches wintry-bare deny the sheen Of the amaranthine leaves and fruit of gold. Till now at last the light Fails from my hope as from the heaven, Where marshal the clouds, blown up with boisterous breath; The trees strain from the blast of death Shrieking convulsed, so fierce the hail is driven Across the vault of night. And now the waving brand Of a cherub lightens down And rends the air with crashing din; Ah, if it be by God's command To show light in the darkness of nature's frown That I my purpose win! It flashes and still flashes, and now I see Qui perdiderit animam suam inveniet. Beyond the blaze glooming a tree, a tree, Stately and large,—(O light deceive not, O weary eyes not now believe not!)— Unseen before; to that I press, Despite the tempest and limbs' tardiness. Lighten, O sword divine, to clear my way, And thou, O happy heart, upstay Steps that falter and swerve, since few Remain; come light again, I shall win through. Angel of Death My flame he hath not abhorred, Nor nature's strife, But lightened through my sword, Hath passed to Life. My task is done; and rewarded, If faithfully; Henceforth no more is guarded, The mystic tree. LINES ON A YOUNG FRIEND WHO DIED JUST BEFORE TAKING ORDERS Put off thy shoes from off thy feet:— So came a voice to thee (tho' shod With preparation, to make meet For God) from God. No vision nor similitude He showed thee then, but, higher grace, His Godhead's self, nor veil-endued, But face to face. Now not by word, O slow of speech, Shalt thou the ills of life console, Nor tongue to ear thy gospel preach, But soul to soul. DURING THE ANTHEM The windows shake with the wind Of the organ-peal above; But angels there enshrined Keep their still look of love: The boys below in the choir Sing plangent notes that drown My heart in tears of fire, But leave unvexed their own. No steadfast angel I; No thoughtless innocent, Through whom God's praise may cry Nor scorch the way it went; Child-haven left, my bark Rides a tumultuous sea, That far, far port its mark,— The saints' serenity. AMBITION Unsummoned they arrive, and pass unchecked, Tall, fair, and chaplet-decked; With wreaths of berried myrtle to allure, Myrtle and bay with glistening dew fresh-varnished; But some bear gold, and some but lilies pure, Some roses heavy-petalled, heavy-scented, Or that sweet bud of May Which lives its hour and falls contented; But who not knows, who knows so well as I That but to touch is loss, their show a lie;— The flowers are shrivelled, and the gold is tarnished. So well as I who knows? But who so well, O sole, O sovereign rose, How life itself lives but to touch and take; For that the blood rejoices, the limbs ache, The brain ferments, the throat is dry; It is the world, life, I; Though fate forbid, it must be mine, must, must! 'Tis mine; a moment, and 'tis summer dust. O heart of golden fire, Self-coined in idle pulse of passionate desire, Wilt thou desire inherit? Then nurse thy flames till they be white from red, And let the ore be shed Into the seething cauldron of thy spirit; And when the minute strikes, pour; and behold True steel, more potent than the finest gold. THE PLOUGHED MEADOW Cowslip and daffodil Spring here for whoso will In the merry meadow Where all the weeds are flowers; Kine will not eat them, But all the sunny hours Merry maidens pleat them, Till night brings shadow. Daffodils die away, Cowslips, from light of day, When the plows shear it, And earth's heart is broken; Blood-poppy takes their place, Sharp sorrow's token; Charlock, the land's disgrace, Assays to cheer it. Dare we then blame the plow, 'Cause darnel springs up now? Where lurked the charlock seeds, When the meads were merry? What sower planted them? Say, who would bury Seeds of them? who wanted them, Flowers that were only weeds? Envoy O daughter mine, O thou, Thou art the meadow, now All thy weeds are flowers. But soon will dawn the hours When thy heart must be broken, When conscience shall shear thee, And heart's blood be the token. Then will shew the weeds Springing apace, apace, Darnel, the heart's disgrace, And charlock, in pale pride, Assaying to cheer thee. But let one sow, sow wide In the furrow, and take heed The seed is the good seed— It shall choke charlock and darnel, For that seed is eternal. CAIAPHAS The signal comes; Azazel's goat is dead. Dead too our sin, and—the atonement fit Such as His people may to God All-dread Present and live,—have paid their lives for it A bullock and a ram; that, type of sin; This, symbol of obedient hearts within. And now I wash: O whiter than white snow, Whiter than these white robes make Thou my hands, Use Thou as I the hyssop, for I go Before Thy Face to do Thy dear commands. I lift the veil, and thro the awful dark Scatter the blood towards the Holy Ark. So it is done: For you, O people mine Thus year by year doth your High-priest atone; Pouring the innocent blood of goats and kine, Bending before the mercy-seat alone. Lo, ye are clean; O bruised, afflicted sore, God hath forgiven you, go, and sin no more. Ay, put away from you the accursed thing, Schism and sedition; give to all their dues: Why make a Christ when Cæsar is your King, Why kick against the pricks, O foolish Jews? Surely 'twere well that one mad man should die, And not the whole people perish utterly. ON A MADONNA AND CHILD OF BELLINI Years pass and change; mother and child remain: Mother so proudly sad, so sadly wise, With perfect face and wonderful calm eyes, Full of a mute expectancy of pain: Child of whose love the mother seems so fain, Looking far off, as if in other skies He saw the hill of crucifixion rise, And knew the horror, and would not refrain. Yet all that pain is over in very deed, And only love shines from those eyes alway; Love to fulfil the world's enormous need, Light to illuminate the devious way, Still brighter as the centuries recede, And more and more unto the perfect day. UNDER THE CANOPY Yes, it is good for us that we are here; Scarlet, and blue, and purple in the sky, The covering of the holy sanctuary, By day obscured, at last by night shines clear. Lo, yonder sinking sun is flaming there In evening sacrifice to God most high, And yonder moon is praying quietly, And her one star holdeth his taper near. Yes, good for us, albeit men may say Could we climb higher past the paths of men, Vague mists would shew for all that fine linen, And all that purple and scarlet turn to grey. It may be, yet for us they keep their hue, And if thou climb beyond, there is still the blue.</field>
