      <field name="fulltext">MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. SONG.—TO NINA. FROM THE SPANISH. “Yo las falacias No se de amor, Es mi Sistema, Un Si o no; A ti quiero Niña Con fino ardor. Templa este fuego, Con si o no! Di me ya pronto El no o Si!” I I know not of Love, All the witcheries and wiles,— Nor may melt thee, and move, With his sighs or his smiles, Ah!—Time's stream still must flow, Should we pause then?—Oh! never!— Be thou mine!—or we sever, Sweet!—my System is ever, Yes or No!—Yes or No! II Thee,—Nina!—I love!— Must this swelling heart burst? Ah!—the Passion I prove, Is of Passions the first! But still Time's stream must flow,— And while thus I am sighing, Brief Life still is flying, Deepest feelings are dying, Say—then say—Yes, or No! III Look on me!—death-black eyes!— While my pale lip must pour, All the passionate sighs Of deep Love,—more and more,— But still Time's stream must flow,— While those dark eyes are shining, And my darker heart pining, Life's fair days are declining, Say—Oh! say—Yes,—or No! IV Endless Sorrows are mine, And Hope fades in my heart, For its life all is thine, And our doom seems to part. But still Time's stream must flow!— And while thus I am wailing, Love's own rare charm is failing, And Life's glad star is paling, Quick—Oh! quick—Yes, or No! V Must I fly?—must we part? Must my days deathward roll? With thy voice in my heart, And thy look on my soul! And still Time's stream shall flow,— While thus I am burning, And Nina!—thou'rt spurning, Fleets sad life, unreturning, Then say Yes—Yes, or No! VI Lingereth ever my care, Saddeneth ever my thought; Till the gloom of Despair To my soul must be brought. And still Time's stream shall flow— While thus I am plaining, And Joy's suns are waning, Care—but care is remaining— Ah!—then say—Yes, or No! VII The heart that thus loves, Wilt thou torture and try? Till the anguish it proves, Makes it madden,—or die? Still,—still, Time's stream must flow,— While in pain I am pouring, All the deep sighs imploring, Of a perfect adoring,— Yes or No!—Yes or No! VIII Could another love thee, Like this heart's burning core; Half my sorrow should flee, But who thus could adore? And still Time's stream must flow,— While my full heart is heaving, And my spirit is grieving, Fate, her dark web is weaving, Say—Oh! say—Yes, or No! IX By the light of thine eyes I must walk the dull earth!— Or for me, summer's skies, Were but darkness and dearth!— And still Time's stream must flow!— Flow, as my thoughts are rushing, All to thee wildly gushing, Still half faded,—half flushing,— Yes or No?—Yes or No? X If 'tis No!—then the tomb Soon shall heal every wound; If 'tis Yes!—then my doom Shall be joy without bound! But still Time's stream must flow,— While our souls, Joy is sunning, And our hearts, Care is shunning, Fast that stream shall be running, Yes or No?—Yes or No? XI Ah!—a smile, full of light, On my soul falleth fair; And my thoughts grow too bright, That were dark with despair! Tide of Time!—onwards press!— But we, we—still are dreaming, Of joys ever beaming, Nor heed thy dull streaming, No or Yes?—No or—YES? SONG. FROM THE GERMAN “DU, DU,” ETC. ETC. I Thou,—thou,—o'er my heart reignest,— Thou,—thou,—rulest o'er my thought,— Still, thou,—thou that loving heart painest, Nor dream'st with what passion 'tis fraught. Yes—Yes!—Ah!—Yes—Yes! With what passion,—what passion, 'tis fraught! II So, so,—even so as I love thee, So, so,—even so thou lov'st me, Deep, deep, the emotions that move thee, Deep as mine own still must be! Yes—Yes!—Ah!—Yes—Yes! Deep as mine own still must be! III Thine,—thine,—my thoughts shall be nightly, Thine,—thine,—my thoughts are by day; Thou,—thou,—the heart that beat lightly, Hast scared from its quiet away,— Yes—Yes!—Ah!—Yes—Yes! Hast scared from its quiet away! IV When,—when thou hast departed, Lives,—lives thine image for me; Then,—then,—though half broken-hearted, I feel Love still binds, me and thee! Yes—Yes!—Ah!—Yes—Yes! I feel Love still binds, thee and me! ANNA MARIE. SONG. I Gentle Anna Marie!—Fairest fair among the fairest,— Of kind ones the dearest!—of true ones the rarest! Forgive these inconstant, light wanderings, and vain, Thrice and tenfold, believe me, thine own love again! Anna Marie. The Death hath gone down to my heart,—dear and dearest!— My thoughts, like changed leaves, are the saddest and serest; I believe, but I die,—I forgive, but I feel,— And the wound thou hast given, not even thou, Love!—canst heal. III Gentle Anna Marie!—wounded dove—say so never,— Ah!—let hope and delight banish wailing, for ever; I fly from light Folly's cold frivolous train, And return thrice, and tenfold, thine own love, again!— Anna Marie. Too late—'tis too late,—for the stern doom is spoken,— Hope and Joy scarce may wake, in the heart that is broken; I forgive thee and bless,—yet, Ah!—cannot bless more, In this short glimpse of peace, than in anguish before! THE PEARL LILY. ADDRESSED TO MISS LOUISA H. SHERIDAN, ON HER RECEIVING FROM HER FEMALE FRIENDS A BEAUTIFUL REPRESENTATION OF A LILY IN PEARLS, “AS A TRIBUTE TO HER TALENTS AND VIRTUES.” I When the crown'd Lily over the Waters leaning, Sheds o'er their restlessness, its sweet repose, Its Shadow hath, a motion and a meaning, And charms the unquiet current, as it flows. II The soul of Beauty, from its urn ascending, Seems to reach Heaven with linkèd lengths of light!— While that clear Shadow to the waves is lending, The Heaven-touched glory—spiritually bright! III Thus, fair Louisa, o'er Life's troubled waters, Such souls as Thine, shed Angel-light and peace; Inspired One!—'midst the Sun's proud laurell'd daughters, At thy pure glance, the unholy tumults cease. IV The snow-white Lily!—sweetly and serenely, That Pearl of Earth may type thee, Bright and Fair! Thou soft of Feeling,—though in Spirit queenly, The worth and whiteness of thy soul are there. V Dear Lady of the Pearly Lily!—surely, No flower, more meet to grace thy beauty, blows; Yet All we fling thee,—thou, entwining purely, The poet's amaranth, with the woman's rose! LINES WRITTEN SHORTLY BEFORE LEAVING MAR LODGE (IN THE HIGHLANDS OF SCOTLAND), 1840. ADDRESSED TO HER GRACE THE DUCHESS OF LEEDS. Farewell to thee, Mar!—and thy proud scenes around, With the pomp of their Mountain-Magnificence crowned; To the heather-robed wild, and the solemn firwood, To the rock, and the cliff, and the many-voiced flood. Farewell!—Oh—Farewell!—I must leave ye ere long,— Noble land of the Chase—of Romance—and of Song, Shall forgetfulness follow that dark word, Farewell? No!—long in my soul all your glories shall dwell. Mighty Nature!—so great and so wondrous around, Thou seem'st ev'n, with a three-fold sublimity crowned; Here we own,—while to thee, all our souls still are given, More majestic thy Earth,—more majestic thy Heaven!— And we feel,—as we hail thee, in gloom or in light, More magnificent, Day,—more magnificent, Night!— For a thousand wild splendours exalt every scene, That now starts to our eyes, where thou reign'st all a queen; And they gather, and grow, and improve, and increase, As they never should change, and they never could cease! And all parts of these regions,—all hours of all time,— Seem to wear a new mystery of beauty sublime. Whether Sunshine and Peace, smile like angels of love, On the glad-brightened earth, from the fair vault above, Or Storm walks in Grandeur of Terrors along, With its train of destructions,—the mighty and strong;— When the clouds sweep in triumph, o'er yonder dark sky, And a wild March of Mountains appeareth on high! (Aye,—those clouds take the shapes, and the semblance they wear, Of the high haughty hills that rise proudly in air)!— Farewell!—Ben-y-vraughten,—nay, Parting's vain sigh, Cannot climb thy far height,—cannot soar to the sky! Too near to The Heavens is thy crest, free and fair, For the cold word of Earth and of Grief, to sound there! Too near to The Heavens, is thy beautiful brow, For the sad word of Earth to obscure it, or bow, Yet who but must feel a regret of the heart, From these scenes in their towering transcendance to part;— Where such wonders and glories, are scattered abroad, Darkness seems more a Grandeur,—and Light more a God; Each element ev'n, like a spirit, and life, Shall appear, in the strength of repose, or of strife! How lately pealed loud on mine ear, undismayed, The Torrent, Glen Coic!—that thrills thy deep shade,— For the beautiful banks, are all glowing and green, Where that speeds like a Conqueror, darkening the scene!— (When the Legions of Strife, through some bright sunny realm, Move with loud-clashing faulchion, and far-beaming helm;) Through its verdant embowerings, it dashes away, And it ruffles the sunshine, and shivers the day. But vain is its fury, to blight all the bliss, Or to chase all the charm, of a scene fair as this! No!—it adds by its contrast of wildness and wrath, To the beauty, that fair spot of loveliness hath. Lin of Dee!—Fare thee well!—how thy rush and thy roar Woke my soul as from sleep—thrilled my heart to the core;— Like thy far-sweeping waves, that go chiming along, In their path of all triumph—the chainless, the strong,— Swept those proud waves of soul!—yet more chainless,—more free,— In a full-gushing current,—a wide-spreading sea!— Noble Water!—thou roll'st in thy strength without bound, In terrific defiance of all things around; Thy cataract-clarion, sounds loud in our ear, And startles the soul, with a rapture of fear! Oh!—wondrous thou art—thou, the Shadowy,—the Bright,— A Voice and a Vision—A Life and a Light! Still thou shoutest and toilest,—till thou break'st far away, To beautify nature, and brighten the day; The Life of the Waters!—they struggle and strive, And the rocks immemorial, they rend and they rive,— They roll on like a river of thunder!—and rage, In the march of their might, ever age after age; The Death of the Waters!—they dash themselves down, As though ruined and conquered,—o'erpowered and o'erthrown; No!—once more they burst forth, with a shout and a shock, With a giant's derision,—and bound past the rock!— All marshalled their forces,—unmeasured their might,— As they fling wide their spray, in disdain and delight! The Chaos of Waters!—they plunge and they part, They reel to and fro, till far forward they dart; But the victory is gained,—and the conflict is done,— Their struggle is over—their triumph is won! The starred Heaven of the Waters!—they glide on in peace, And their thunders are silenced,—their labours shall cease; In the beauty and blessing of quiet, they pass, And spread out to the sky's smiling azure, their glass! Farewell to the proud hills, that swarm with the deer, That vast antlered army!—encamped far and near; Free as thought in their might, and more wild than the wind, How they seem e'en to leave, the swift lightning behind! Bold Kings of the Mountains, that blacken round Mar, Lords of Steep Ben-y-vraughten, and dark Lochnagarr!— Farewell to these scenes of enchantment sublime, That my heart shall retain, till its last hour of time! Ah!—a power and a charm, to these regions is given,— Earth ariseth in Mountains, to melt into Heaven; (And our souls rise and swell!—and exult more and more,— In those Shapes of Stupendousness cloathed, Lo!—they soar!—) Earth ariseth in Mountains!—her fair crest she rears,— Till herself too all Heaven, then divinely appears. But farewell to these prospects, unmatched and sublime, Where Eternity's sea, seems engulphing all time: Where we own,—while their beauties, still bound to new birth, More magnificent, Heaven!—more magnificent, Earth! Farewell to yon glad vale of peace and delight, Where the beautiful River, flows onward in light; Farewell to thee—Lady of mountainous Mar!— Who hast led my glad footsteps in freedom so far; Farewell to thee, Lady!—Farewell, gentle guide! Well thou know'st these fair scenes, in their fulness of pride,— Well thy soul can reflect—while thine eye can revere, All the glory of nature, throned evermore here! Thine enthusiast soul, 'midst these scenes I admired, And the lay I have written,—thy words have inspired! THE POET. ON READING SHELLEY'S SONG, “I ARISE FROM DREAMS OF THEE.” I Few know the Poet's gentle heart, Few sound his mighty mind, Such passions throb through every part, More fleet than Light and Wind! II Few mark his fiery spirit's Wars, Or grasp its kingly dowers; Few count its billows, or its stars, Its thunders, or its flowers! III His soul is hidden in a Light Of glory never known;— His very thought may pierce in might, Others,—but not his own! IV His mind from heights to heights ascends, Fresh mysteries to explore; With all the Universe it blends, Then dreams a Wonder more! V Oh!—if the task to pierce that mind, Prove earthly powers above; Then, who his heart's great depths shall find, Or sound a Poet's love? THE BIRTH OF A FEELING. When some New Feeling, bursts to mighty sway, And bids the astonished heart at once obey, What strange, sweet tremblings, seize the startled breast, And witch it wildly, from its silent rest. The wondering thought springs onward, prompt to greet, The electric shock, that yet it fears to meet! Ah! exquisite must ever be that hour, Which sees a fresh, deep Feeling wake to power! The new-made mother clasps her dear-loved boy, And half the joy's the freshness of the joy!— The all welcome stranger is with bliss received, Too boundless seems that bliss to be believed!— With some late-quickened feeling, what a rush Of rich emotions meet in one strong gush, 'Tis like Creation in the Soul!—a birth, Into a newer nature and young earth! Sere thoughts grow green again,—and brightly wear, The lovely livery, lost in pining care; Give a new Feeling,—and you give, indeed, A new existence,—from dull trammels freed! With one glad, mighty bound, the wondering soul Escapes from bleak Monotony's controul; From chill Obstruction's wearying yoke it springs, And finds and feels, the joy and strength of wings! The lightning life of wings!—the bursting bliss, Of such a dear and glowing change as this. New Feelings are new Beings!—evermore, Rekindling Life's lost flame within its core; Retouching vividly with magic might, Faint, faded lines—till all again is,—Light! (And, oh!—worth while 'tis, so to see them fade, E'en thus to see them, trebly precious made!) New Feelings are new Fates!—and they shall fling, Their own fair likeness, o'er each earthly thing. Remaking all the soul, through each changed part, As with a mighty and triumphant art,— Till the bright Stranger, to herself unknown, Hails life as something, ne'er before, her own! Aye!—here the wonder smiles,—the enchantment spreads,— Seems life renewed to all its fountain-heads. Thus, not the Feeling's self, is it alone, That shall the transport, and the triumph own,— 'Tis not the Feeling's self!—it is the Soul, Which gains and grows, by that untried controul! 'Tis not the Feeling's Self!—it is the state To which it brings that Soul, it doth create; Revivifying all the Real,—and still Rebuilding Phantasies, Time sought to chill. Oh!—blest New Feelings!—at their touch,—behold! What dazzling colours, paint Life's darkened mould! Aye!—still they fling their magic o'er the scene, Recalling all delights, that e'er have been. Revivifying and restoring bliss, Yea, true!—and more, even more, they do than this, Discovering ever, new profounds of soul, To bear and bless, that exquisite controul; Too much men talk, in wise and pompous strain, Of Time-stamped Ties, which hearts must still retain! Time-stamped, indeed, they are!—and, Lo!—they bear, The pale impressions of Life's gnawing care, And oft, too oft, the curse of its despair. The dull cloud-shadows of the world around, The eating fetters, Fortune's hand hath wound;— And many a stain of earth, and many a gloom, And many a dull foreshadowing of the tomb! Old Feelings reek o' the earth!—and ever show, Some substance,—or some shadowy glimpse of woe,— Old Feelings reek o' the earth!—though deep,—though true,— But nought of earth hath crushed or chilled,—The New! Dark hours have tamed each vision of our Past, But Time hath tamed not,—touched not, even,—The Last! These fair, strange guests, have never owned his reign, Ne'er thrilled with fear,—and never ached with pain,— Glad Fathers of the Future!—these might seem, With not one cloud, to dim each radiant dream; Ah! let them come, and let them call around Sweet morning smiles of promise,—fair and crowned,— Tread out the dull, dead traces of old Care, And leave the footprints of white Hopings there! As new-born Planets, swift through Ether roll, The bright, fresh Feeling, sweeps into the soul!— All Light and Glory!—wide around to spread, A glow eternal, far and farther shed; It leaps and lives, through all the kindling life, To arm its energies,—yet hush its strife, And Ah!—Joy lightens, more than ever fair, When lightening, forth from blackest, worst despair! Aye!—as new Orbs, on their high progress start, Each bright, fresh impulse, bursts into the heart, Yet no,—those Feelings more like angels prove, No worlds they need,—but worlds of inborn love;— Let man not praise the sacredness of all, That most hath borne Time's disenchanting thrall, More precious seems the consciousness supreme, Of that New Thought,—that spirit-dazzling dream!— More sacred that, which riseth fresh and free, And thrills and burns with immortality! Aye,—feels its immortality sublime, And downward glanceth, on the stream of Time; That stream, which never yet with drops of woe, Hath chilled its truth, or quenched its living glow, Far streaming through ten thousand Worlds at once, It wakes all nature to one deep response— Ten thousand Worlds—ten thousand Suns shall seem,— More bright for that Emparadising Dream!— It burns to being, with one raptured start, And stamps its full-fraught image on the heart. Not yet shall thoughts of Death, and Change, and Doom, Athwart its Light of contemplations come. Yea! still more sacred, that which riseth free, And feels its wondrous immortality! From the ashes of a banished dream shall spring, A far more glorious—far more perfect thing! Even winning from the heavy, bygone woe, A priceless gift,—a yet diviner glow. When fresh-born Feelings flow into the heart, It owns more mystic life, through each deep part, From these, another Universe upsprings, And one, on fire with joy,—elate with wings! (All feelings show like eagles at their birth, But change too oft, to grovellers on the Earth;) Their hours are sped on Seraphs' wings of light, And even their shadows, seem too strangely bright; The electrifying impulses shall wake, To make past griefs even dear, for their glad sake. For these the Soul awaited!—even as Space, Till coming Suns, upsprang to run their race!— They leave unlighted, no forgotten spot,— Before was all not Blank,—where they were not! The past becomes their ornament!—they wear, On their own beauty, each sad, fallen tear, To make that beauty more, and deeply add, To all the charms, wherewith they thus are clad! The light of each lost smile, they borrow, too, The tears too many, and the smiles too few! Till bright and gloomy fancies, known of old, But help to swell their various pomp unrolled; Changed Feelings, with their anguish, wrong and care, Prove but Enriching Tributaries there! And thus but lend a light, and grant a grace, To all the loveliness, which bears their trace. Whate'er the heart hath known of strong and deep, The reigning, fresh Emotion yet shall reap: No pangs it brings!—but hints of these 'twill find, When ushered gladly to the mastered mind, Yet such past pain, shall leave strange worth and power And crowd the hoards of ages, in an hour! Ah, yes!—whate'er the heart hath felt of deep, The reigning, fresh Emotion yet shall reap! No Care hath it!—no Anguish of its own,— But these that heart hath studied, learned, and known;— Hath conned the old lore of Life's profoundest things, And dived into the silence of Her springs,— Her lessons lingered o'er,—her secrets stored,— Her wonders weighed,—her mysteries well explored,— Plunged in the abyss of Passions,—dread and dire, And wrestled with the Powers, that there conspire, And fathomed all the marvels of their moods, And stemmed the torrents of their fiery floods,— To give it all their wealth, and all their might, To flush its warmth,—and gild its dawning light!— To give it all their depth, and truth, and force, But nothing of their wrongs,—or their remorse;— All, all, their force and fulness, deeply traced, But nothing of their wildness,—and their waste! No!—all the depth, and solemn strength they bring, Shall make that late-born dream, a mighty thing;— A mighty, and a deathless, and a deep, Though now to sudden life, alone it leap! (No tongue can tell,—no breathing words express, How fathomless, its unrevealed excess!) Yea! deep as this, that sorrowing gloom had brought, Which dwells but in the memory of its thought! Thus, through that Long Rehearsal went the heart, As but to learn, and act its perfect part: Then close the seas of soul o'er that dark wreck, Which leaves behind, no shadow—and no speck. Its tossing World of Waters, shuts o'er all, That might a suffering, or a shock recall; That Soul hath been a student in the school, Of heaviest trial, and the sternest rule; That deepening still, it may exulting, gain The best of Pleasure, from the worst of Pain! And now its lore, its deep experience now, It brings where influence dear, 'twould most avow! The treasures of the Past, it burning brings, That Past,—whose pangs, thus turn to precious things! So let these sorrows but exalt and crown, The wakening joy, that whispers,—they are flown, So let these strengthen, and improve the excess, Of present trust, and present happiness. While burst, to beaming power, a deathless throng, Of happy visions,—meet for souls of song, And proud illustrious phantasies arise, Too dazzling even, for Rapture's lifted eyes!— Another soul, within the soul is born, Fresh as the air,—and radiant as the morn. New, bright sensations, spring in glorying might, And bound to Being, like a birth of Light! All wear their hue, and all partake their ray, That flings abroad, a dazzlery of day; Rise, then, fair Sun of Soul!—and never set, The Night of Sorrow let that Soul forget! Another sky—a different earth appears,— All glistening in the smiles that flashed from tears; All, all must still seem New, when New the soul, Creation opening, freshens through the whole. Even like a freshening Sea!—the spirit seems, Astir with quickening Thoughts,—and wakening Dreams! Oh!—bright, New Feeling!—thou shalt be, and art, Its first, true, sole existence to the heart! Aye, Joy!—it wakes,—it springs,—to boundless birth,— And spurns the yoke of Time, and laughs at Earth! LINES WRITTEN AFTER READING A MS. POEM BY ? ?. 1841. Thy thoughts still teem with all things, high and bright, Thou lov'st fair nature, in her power and might, Thou lift'st thy voice to speak in her deep praise Two different Spirits rule thy bright young days!— How different!—one still points and prompts on high, And one leads every dream from yon fair sky,— One seems the Soul of Truth, and Light, and Power, And One, the Phantom of Life's worldlier hour. Yet say I not—give ear to my faint voice, I dare not hope, that this, might prompt thy choice, Nor bid I thee to mark each lettered page, That rolls the tide of truth from age to age! Take thy fair Thoughts for Counsellors!—the best, The clear, proud promptings of thine own young breast! Whate'er thou dost on earth, I know and see, Must bear the stamp of thy high heart, and free! I know whate'er thou dost, beneath the sun, Must be enthusiastically done; The strength of zeal with such a fiery flow, Still bids thy rushing fancy, soar and glow, And sets,—while full and high thy life-pulse plays, Thy young imaginations all ablaze;— Aye!—thou hailest Nature, in her power and might, And all the Heaven within her, meets thy sight!— And canst thou slight her spells?—Canst turn away From Her magnificently-proud array?— Canst shut thy soul against her?—and disown Thine own high worship at her Starry Throne?— The Power is thine to bid her breathe and blaze, Through Painting's hues, or Poetry's deep lays;— Still thou hast the envied power to bid her shine, In conscious colours,—or the living line! Some may have far less blame, in whose cold mind, No glorious light, burns deathlessly enshrined! But thou!—thine every noble thought in time, Shall trumpet stern reproach,—and speak of crime! The crime of self-neglect!—thou must not turn, From those high thoughts, that in thee live and burn, The quick Life lightens through thy veins!—for thee No medium, and no stagnant pause may be. Speak!—were it not a shame,—a strange, foul blot,— If thou shouldest be so high,—and yet art not? Too noble is thy mind, to be thus driven, From every path, that leads to Light and Heaven, Thou need'st no judges but the thoughts within, High trumpets!—heard through all Life's pealing din, The Avengers or the Exalters they must be, Strong in their towering immortality!— Two Destinies dispute thy bright young days, One high and glorious!—meet for pride and praise,— One dull and earthly-tainted!—choose between! But canst thou to the vain and worldly lean? Oh!—answer it to that still mounting mind, That chained and checked, would yet leave Earth behind! Born thus to be a child of Light and Song, Say,—Should'st thou scorn thy doom, and cling to wrong? How oft have I, and others, listening found, What power hath zeal, that never knew a bound!— What power to animate, convince, surprise, And wing the hour with triumph as it flies; How oft have loftiest sentiments inspired, From lips, Enthusiasm's self hath fired! Genius hath hailed and claimed thee for her own, Her glorious light far round Her son is thrown. Canst thou resign that empire vast and proud, Of Thought, and Will, and Mind,—too vainly bowed, To all the idols of Life's common crowd? Then never dare, thus let high feelings start, Like giants—to reveal thy true, deep heart! Nor let those noble impulses have power To sway and guide thee, in thy brighter hour; Hide,—hide thy better nature in the shade, 'Tis all too sad, to see its truth displayed,— Too sad!—when after-hours the proof still bring, That best thou lov'st to check its glorious spring! That best thou lov'st to wrong its priceless trust, And stoop its winged ambition, to the dust! Hide it from us,—and from thyself,—at least, And shroud those useless fires, from thy breast, That light it,—but to perish and to pale, As thou would'st wish to fall,—and choose to fail!— Aye!—hide the lofty heart,—the aspiring soul,— If these must sink beneath a dark controul, Nor let us hail such stars,—if born to set,— If so much hope, must bring so much regret! Yet no! it shall not be! avert it, thou,— By all that soars most noble in thee,—now! Now vindicate thyself, thy mind, thy heart, Tread the fair path, and act the firmer part, O'er all the Present fling such floods of light, That even Thy Past's worst, darkest clouds grow bright!</field>
