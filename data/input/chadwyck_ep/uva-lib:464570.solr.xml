[Soules joy, now I am gone] Soules joy, now I am gone, And you alone, (Which cannot be, Since I must leave my selfe with thee, And carry thee with me) Yet when unto our eyes Absence denyes Each others sight, And makes to us a constant night, When others change to light; O give no way to griefe, But let beliefe Of mutuall love, This wonder to the vulgar prove Our Bodyes, not wee move. Let not thy wit beweepe Words but sense deepe, For when we misse By distance our hopes joyning blisse, Even then our soules shall kisse, Fooles have no meanes to meet, But by their feet, Why should our clay, Over our spirits so much sway, To tie us to that way? O give no way to griefe, &amp;c. Farewell to love. VVhilst yet to prove, I thought there was some Deitie in love So did I reverence, and gave Worship, as Atheists at their dying houre Call, what they cannot name, an unknowne power, As ignorantly did I crave: Thus when Things not yet knowne are coveted by men, Our desires give them fashion, and so As they waxe lesser, fall, as they sise, grow. But, from late faire His hignesse sitting in a golden Chaire, Is not lesse cared for after three dayes By children, then the thing which lovers so Blindly admire, and with such worship wooe; Being had, enjoying it decayes: And thence, What before pleas'd them all, takes but one sense, And that so lamely, as it leaves behinde A kinde of sorrowing dulnesse to the minde. Ah cannot wee, As well as Cocks and Lyons jocund be, After such pleasures, unlesse wise Nature decreed (since each such Act, they say, Diminisheth the length of life a day) This; as shee would man should despise The sport, Because that other curse of being short, And onely for a minute made to be Eager, desires to raise posterity. Since so, my minde Shall not desire what no man else can finde, I'll no more dote and runne To pursue things which had indammag'd me. And when I come where moving beauties be, As men doe when the summers Sunne Growes great, Though I admire their greatnesse, shun their heat; Each place can afford shadowes. If all faile, 'Tis but applying worme-seed to the Taile. Song.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Deare Love continue nice and chaste] Deare Love continue nice and chaste, For, if you yeeld you doe me wrong, Let duller wits to loves end haste, I have enough to wooe thee long. All paine and joy is in their way; The things we feare bring lesse annoy Then feare; and hope brings greater joy; But in themselves they cannot stay. Small favours will my prayers increase; Granting my suit you give me all, And then my prayers must needs surcease. For, I have made your Godhead fall. Beasts cannot will, nor beauty see, They, mans affections onely move; Beasts other sports of love doe prove, With better feeling farre than we. Then Love prolong my suite, for thus By losing sport, I sports doe win; And that doth vertue prove in us, Which ever yet hath beene a sinne. My comming neare may spie some ill, And now the world is given to scoffe; To keepe my Love, (then) keepe me off, And so I shall admire thee still. Say I have made a perfect choyce, Sacietie our selves may kill; Then give me but thy face and voyce, My eye and eare thou canst not fill. To make me rich (oh) be not poore, Give me not all, yet something lend, So I shall still my suite commend, And you at will doe lesse or more. But, if to all you condescend, My love, our sport, your Godhead end. Song. [Stand still, and I will read to thee] Stand still, and I will read to thee A Lecture, Love, in loves philosophy. These three houres that we have spent, Walking here; Two shadowes went Along with us, which we our selves produc'd; But, now the Sunne is just aboue our head, We doe those shadowes tread; And to brave clearnesse all things are reduc'd. So whilst our infant loves did grow, Disguises did, and shadowes, flow, From us, and our cares; but, now 'tis not so. That love hath not attain'd the high'st degree, Which is still diligent lest others see: Except our loves at this noone stay, We shall new shadowes make the other way. As the first were made to blinde Others; these which come behinde Will worke upon our selves, and blind our eyes. If our loves faint, and westwardly decline; To me thou, falsly, thine, And I to thee mine actions shall disguise. The morning shadowes weare away, But these grow longer all the day, But oh, loves day is short, if love decay. Love is a growing, or full constant light; And his short minute, after noone, is night. The end of the Songs and Sonets. ELEGIES. Eleg. XII. The Bracelet. Vpon the losse of his Mistresses Chaine, for which he made satisfaction. Not that in colour it was like thy haire, For Armelets of that thou maist let me weare: Nor that thy hand it oft embrac'd and kist, For so it had that good, which oft I mist: Nor for that silly old moralitie, That as these linkes were knit, our love should bee: Mourne I that I thy seavenfold chaine have lost; Nor for the luck sake; but the bitter cost. O, shall twelve righteous Angels, which as yet No leaven of vile soder did admit; Nor yet by any way have straid or gone From the first state of their Creation; Angels, which heaven commanded to provide All things to me, and be my faithfull guide; To gaine new friends, t'appease great enemies; To comfort my soule, when I lie or rise. Shall these twelve innocents, by thy severe Sentence (dread judge) my sins great burden beare: Shall they be damn'd, and in the furnace throwne, And punisht for offences not their owne? They save not me, they doe not ease my paines, When in that hell they'are burnt and tyed in chains: Were they but Crownes of France, I cared not, For, most of these, their Countreys naturall rot I think possesseth, they come here to us, So pale, so lame, so leane, so ruinous. And howsoe'r French Kings most Christian be, Their Crownes are circumcis'd most Iewishly; Or were they Spanish Stamps, still travelling, That are become as Catholique as their King, Those unlickt heare-whelps, unfil'd pistolets That (more than Canon shot) availes or lets; Which negligently left unrounded, looke Like many angled figures, in the booke Of some great Conjurer that would enforce Nature, as these doe justice, from her course. Which, as the soule quickens head, feet and heart, As streames like veines, run through th'earth's every part, Visit all Countries, and have slily made Gorgeous France, ruin'd: ragged and decay'd Scotland, which knew no State, proud in one day: And mangled seventeen-headed Belgia: Or were it such gold as that wherewithall Almighty Chymiques from each minerall, Having by subtle fire a soule out-pull'd; Are dirtely and desperately gull'd: I would not spit to quench the fire they'are in, For, they are guilty of much hainous Sin. But, shall my harmlesse angels perish? Shall I lose my guard, my ease, my food, my all? Much hope which they should nourish will be dead. Much of my able youth, and lusty head Will vanish, if thou love let them alone, For thou wilt love me lesse when they are gone, And be content that some lowd squeaking Cryer Well-pleas'd with one leane thred-bare groat, for hire, May like a devill roare through every street; And gall the finders conscience; if hee meet. Or let mee creepe to some dread Conjurer. That with phantastique scenes fils full much paper; Which hath divided heaven in tenements, And with whores, theeves, and murderers stuft his rents So full, that though hee passe them all in sinne, He leaves himselfe no roome to enter in. But if, when all his art and time is spent, Hee say 'twill ne'r be found; yet be content; Receive from him that doome ungrudgingly, Because he is the mouth of destiny. Thou say'st (alas) the gold doth still remaine, Though it be chang'd, and put into a chaine, So in the first falne angels, resteth still Wisdome and knowledge; but, 'tis turn'd to ill: As these should doe good works; and should provide Necessities; but now must nurse thy pride, And they are still bad angels; Mine are none; For, forme gives being: and their forme is gone: Pitty these Angels yet; their dignities Passe Vertues, Powers, and Principalities. But, thou art resolute; Thy will be done; Yet with such anguish, as her onely sonne The Mother in the hungry grave doth lay, Vnto the fire these Martyrs I betray. Good soules, (for you give life to every thing) Good Angels, (for good messages you bring) Destin'd you might have beene to such an one, As would have lov'd and worship'd you alone: One that would suffer hunger, nakednesse, Yea death, ere he would make your number lesse. But, I am guilty of your sad decay; May your few-fellowes longer with me stay. But ô thou wretched finder whom I hate So, that I almost pitty thy estate: Gold being the heaviest metal amongst all, May my most heavy curse upon thee fall: Here fetter'd, manacled, and hang'd in chains, First mayst thou bee; then chaind to hellish paines; Or be with forraine gold brib'd to betray Thy Countrey, and faile both of it and thy pay. May the next thing thou stoop'st to reach, containe Poyson, whose nimble fume rot thy moist braine; Or libels, or some interdicted thing, Which negligently kept, thy ruine bring. Lust-bred diseases rot thee; and dwell with thee Itching desire, and no abilitie. May all the evils that gold ever wrought; All mischiefe that all devils ever thought; Want after plenty; poore and gouty age; The plagues of travellers; love; marriage Afflict thee, and at thy lives last moment, May thy swolne sinnes themselves to thee present. But, I forgive; repent thee honest man: Gold is Restorative, restore it then: But if from it thou beest loath to depart, Because 'tis cordiall, would twere at thy heart. Eleg. XIII.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Come, Fates; I feare you not. All whom I owe] Come, Fates; I feare you not. All whom I owe Are paid, but you. Then rest me ere I goe. But, Chance from you all soveraignty hath got, Love woundeth none but those whom death dares not; Else, if you were, and just in equitie, I should have vanquish'd her, as you did me. Else Lovers should not brave death's pains, and live, But 'tis a rule, Death comes not to relieve. Or, pale and wan deaths terrours, are they lay'd So deepe in Lovers, they make death afraid? Or (the least comfort) have I company? Or can the Fates love death, as well as mee? Yes, Fates doe silke unto her distaffe pay, For ransome, which taxe they on us doe lay. Love gives her youth which is the reason why Youths, for her sake, some wither and some die. Poore death can nothing give; yet, for her sake, Still in her turne, he doth a Lover take. And if death should prove false, she feares him not; Our Muses, to redeeme her she hath got. That fatall night we last kiss'd, I thus pray'd, (Or rather, thus despair'd; I should have said,) Kisses, and yet despaire. The forbid tree Did promise (and deceive) no more than she. Like Lambs that see their teats, and must eat Hay, A food, whose tast hath made me pine away. Dives, when thou saw'st blisse, and crav'dst to touch A drop of water, thy great paines were such. Here griefe wants a fresh wit, for mine being spent, And my sighes weary, groanes are all my rent; Vnable longer to indure the paine, They breake like thunder, and doe bring down rain. Thus, till dry teares soulder mine eyes, I weepe; And then, I dreame, how you securely sleepe, And in your dreames doe laugh at me. I hate, And pray Love All may: He pitties my state, But sayes, I therein no revenge shall finde; The Sunne would shine, though all the world were blind. Yet, to trie my hate, Love shew'd me your teare; And I had dy'd, had not your smile beene there. Your frowne undoes me; your smile is my wealth; And as you please to looke, I have my health. Me thought, Love pittying me, when he saw this, Gave me your hands, the backs and palmes to kisse. That cur'd me not, but to beare paine gave strength, And what is lost in force, is tooke in length. I call'd on Love againe, who fear'd you so, That his compassion still prov'd greater woe; For, then I dream'd I was in bed with you, But durst not feele, for feare't should not be true. This merits not our anger, had it beene: The Queene of chastitie was naked seene, And in bed, not to feele the paine I tooke, Was more, then for Actæon not to looke. And that brest which lay ope, I did not know, But for the clearnesse, from a lump of snow. Eleg. XIIII. His parting from her. Since she must goe, and I must mourne, come night Environ me with darknesse, whilst I write: Shadow that hell unto me, which alone I am to suffer when my soule is gone. Have we for this kept guards, like spie o'r Spie? Had correspondence whilst the foe stood by? Stolne (more to sweeten them) our many blisses Of meetings, conference, imbracements, kisses? Shadow'd with negligence our most respects? Varied our language through all dialects Of becks, winkes, lookes, and often under boards Spoake dialogues with our feet farre from words? Have we prov'd all the secrets of our Art, Yea, thy pale inwards, and thy panting heart? And, after all this passed Purgatory, Must sad divorce make us the vulgar story? Fortune, doe thy worst, my friend and I have armes, Though not against thy strokes, against thy harmes. Bend us, in sunder thou canst not divide Our bodies so, but that our soules are ty'd, And we can love by letters still and gifts, And thoughts and dreames; Love never wanteth shifts. I will not looke upon the quickning Sunne, But straight her beauty to my sense shall runne; The ayre shall note her soft, the fire most pure; Waters suggest her cleare, and the earth sure; Time shall not lose our passages; The spring How fresh our love was in the beginning; The summer, how it ripened in the yeare; And Autumne, what our golden harvests were. The winter I'll not thinke on to spight thee, But count it a lost season, so shall shee. And this to th'comfort of my Deare I vow, My deeds shall still bee what my deeds are now; The Poles shall move to teach me, ere I start; And when I change my Love, I'll change my heart, Nay, if I waxe but cold in my desire, Thinke, heaven hath motion lost, and the world, fire: Much more I could, but many words have made That, oft, suspected which men would perswade; Take therefore all in this: I love so true, As I will never looke for lesse in you. Eleg. XV. Julia. Harke newes, ô envy, thou shalt heare descry'd My Iulia; who as yet was ne'r envy'd. To vomit gall in slander, swell her vaines With calumny, that hell it selfe disdaines, Is her continuall practice, does her best, To teare opinion even out of the brest Of dearest friends, and (which is worse than vile) Sticks jelousie in wedlock, her owne childe Scapes not the showres of envie, To repeate The monstrous fashions, how, were, alive, to eate Deare reputation. Would to God she were But halfe so loath to act vice, as to heare My milde reproofe. Liv'd Mantuan now againe, That fœmall Mastix, to limme with his penne This she Chymera, that hath eyes of fire, Burning with anger, anger feeds desire, Tongued like the night-crow, whose ill boding cries Give out for nothing but new injuries, Her breath like to the juice in Tenarus That blasts the springs, though ne'r so prosperous. Her hands, I know not how, us'd more to spill The food of others, then her selfe to fill. But oh her minde, that Orcus, which includes Legions of mischiefe, countlesse multitudes Of formlesse curses, projects unmade up, Abuses yet unfashion'd, thoughts corrupt, Mishapen Cavils, palpable untroths, Inevitable errours, self-accusing loathes: These, like those Atoms swarming in the Sunne, Throng in her bosome for creation. I blush to give her halfe her due; yet say, No poyson's halfe so bad as Iulia. Eleg. XVI. A Tale of a Citizen and his Wife. I sing no harme good sooth to any wight, To Lord or foole, Cuckold, begger or knight, To peace-teaching Lawyer, Proctor, or brave Reformed or reduced Captaine, Knave, Officer, Iugler, or Iustice of peace, Iuror or Iudge; I touch no fat sowes grease, I am no Libeller, nor will be any, But (like a true man) say there are too many. I feare not ore tenus, for my tale, Nor Count nor Counsellour will looke redd or pale. A Citizen and his wife the other day Both riding on one horse, upon the way I overtooke, the wench a pretty peate, And (by her eye) well fitting for the feate, I saw the lecherous Citizen turne backe His head, and on his wifes lip steale a smacke, Whence apprehending that the man was kinde, Riding before, to kisse his wife behinde. To get acquaintance with him I began To sort discourse fit for so fine a man: I ask'd the number of the Plaguing Bill. Ask'd if the custome Farmers held out still, Of the Virginian plot, and whether Ward The traffique of the Iland seas had marr'd, Whether the Brittaine Burse did fill apace, And likely were to give th'Exchange disgrace; Of new-built Algate, and the More-field crosses, Of store of Bankerouts, and poore Merchants losses I urged him to speake; But he (as mute As an old Courtier worne to his last suite) Replies with onely yeas and nayes; At last (To fit his element) my theame I cast On Tradesmens gaines; that set his tongue a going, Alas, good sir (quoth he) There is no doing In Court nor City now; she smil'd and I, And (in my conscience) both gave him the lie In one met thought: but he went on apace, And at the present time with such a face He rail'd, as fray'd me; for he gave no praise, To any but my Lord of Essex dayes; Call'd that the age of action; true (quoth I) There's now as great an itch of bravery, And heat of taking up, but cold lay downe, For, put to push of pay, away they runne; Our onely City trades of hope now are Bawds, Tavern-keepers, Whores and Scriveners, The much of Priviledg'd kinsmen, and store Of fresh protections make the rest all poore; In the first state of their Creation, Though many stoutly stand, yet proves not one A righteous pay-master. Thus ranne he on In a continued rage: so void of reason Seem'd his harsh talke, I sweat for feare of treason. And (troth) how could I lesse? when in the prayer For the protection of the wise Lord Major, And his wise brethrens worships, when one prayeth, He swore that none could say Amen with faith. To get him from what I glowed to heare, (In happy time) an Angel did appeare, The bright Signe of a lov'd and wel-try'd Inne, Where many Citizens with their wives had beene, Well us'd and often; here I pray'd him stay, To take some due refreshment by the way. Looke how hee look'd that hid the gold (his hope) And at returne found nothing but a Rope, So he at me: refus'd and made away. Though willing she pleaded a weary stay. I found my misse, struck hands, and praid him tell (To hold acquaintance still) where he did dwell; He barely nam'd the street, promis'd the Wine, But his kinde wife gave me the very Signe. The end of the Elegies. SATYRES. Satyre VI.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Men write that love and reason disagree.] Men write that love and reason disagree. But I ne'r saw't exprest as 'tis in thee. Well, I may lead thee, God must make thee see, But, thine eyes blinde too, there's no hope for thee. Thou say'st shee's wise and witty, faire and free, All these are reasons why she should scorne thee. Thou dost protest thy love, and wouldst it shew By matching her as she would match her foe: And wouldst perswade her to a worse offence, Then that whereof thou didst accuse her wench. Reason there's none for thee, but thou may'st vexe Her with example. Say, for feare her sexe Shunne her, she needs must change; I doe not see How reason e'r can bring that must to thee. Thou art a match a Iustice to rejoyce, Fit to be his, and not his daughters choyce. Dry'd with his threats shee'd scarcely stay with thee, And wouldst th'have this to chuse thee, being free? Goe then and punish some soone-gotten stuffe, For her dead husband this hath mourn'd enough, In hating thee. Thou maist one like this meet; For spight take her, prove kinde, make thy breath sweet. Let her see she hath cause, &amp; to bring to thee Honest children, let her dishonest bee. If shee be a widow, I'll warrant her Shee'll thee before her first husband preferre, And will wish thou hadst had her maidenhead, (Shee'll love thee so) for, then thou hadst bin dead. But thou such strong love, and weake reasons hast, Thou must thrive there, or ever live disgrac'd. Yet pause a while; and thou maist live to see A time to come, wherein she may beg thee. If thou'lt not pause nor change, she'll beg thee now, Doe what she can, love for nothing shee'll allow. Besides, here were too much gaine and merchandise, And when thou art rewarded, desert dies. Now thou hast odds of him she loves, he may doubt Her constancy, but none can put thee out. Againe, be thy love true, shee'll prove divine, And in the end the good on't will be thine. For, though thou must ne'r thinke of other love, And so wilt advance her as high above Vertue as cause above effect can bee, 'Tis vertue to be chaste, which shee'll make thee. The end of the Satyres. LETTERS TO SEVERALL Personages. Incerto. At once from hence my lines and I depart, I to my soft still walkes, they to my Heart: I to the Nurse, they to the child of Art; Yet as a firme house, though the Carpenter Perish, doth stand: as an Embassadour Lyes safe, how e'r his King be in danger: So, though I languish, prest with Melancholy; My verse, the strict Map of my misery, Shall live to see that, for whose want I die. Therefore I envy them, and doe repent, That from unhappy me, things happy are sent; Yet as a Picture, or bare Sacrament, Accept these lines, and if in them there be Merit of love, bestow that love on me. To the Countesse of Huntington. That unripe side of earth, that heavy clime That gives us man up now, like Adams time Before he ate; mans shape, that would yet bee (Knew they not it, and fear'd beasts companie) So naked at this day, as though man there From Paradise so great a distance were, As yet the newes could not arrived bee Of Adams tasting the forbidden tree; Depriv'd of that free state which they were in, And wanting the reward, yet beare the sinne. But, as from extreme hights who downward looks, Sees men at childrens shapes, Rivers at brookes, And loseth younger formes; so, to your eye, These (Madame) that without your distance lie, Must either mist, or nothing seeme to be, Who are at home but wits mere Atomi: But, I who can behold them move, and stay, Have found my selfe to you, just their midway; And now must pitty them; for, as they doe Seeme sick to me, just so must I to you, Yet neither will I vexe your eyes to see A sighing Ode, nor crosse-arm'd Elegie. I come not to call pitty from your heart, Like some white-liver'd dotard that would part Else from his slipperie soule with a faint groane, And faithfully, (without you smil'd) were gone. I cannot feele the tempest of a frowne, I may be rais'd by love, but not throwne down, Though I can pittie those sigh twice a day, I hate that thing whispers it selfe away. Yet since all love is fever, who to trees Doth talke, doth yet in loves cold ague freeze. 'Tis love, but, with such fatall weaknesse made, That it destroyes it selfe with its owne shade. Who first look'd sad, griev'd, pin'd, and shew'd his paine. Was he that first taught women, to disdaine. As all things were one nothing, dull and weake, Vntill this raw disordered heape did breake, And severall desires led parts away, Water declin'd with earth, the ayre did stay, Fire rose, and each from other but unty'd, Themselves unprison'd were and purify'd: So was love, first in vast confusion hid, An unripe willingnesse which nothing did, A thirst, an Appetite which had no case, That fo?d a want, but knew not what would please. What pretty innocence in those dayes mov'd? Man ignorantly walk'd by her he lov'd; Both sigh'd and enterchang'd a speaking eye, Both trembled and were sick, both knew not why, That naturall fearefulnesse that struck man dumbe, Might well (those times considered) man become. As all discoverers whose first assay Findes but the place, after, the nearest way: So passion is to womans love, about, Nay, farther off, than when we first set out. It is not love that sueth, or doth contend; Love either conquers, or but meets a friend. Man's better part consists of purer fire, And findes it selfe allow'd, ere it desire. Love is wise here, keepes home, gives reason sway, And journeys not till it finde summer-way. A weather-beaten Lover but once knowne, Is sport for every girle to practise on. Who strives through womans scornes, women to know. Is lost, and seekes his shadow to outgoe; It must bee sicknesse after one disdaine, Though he be call'd aloud, to looke againe. Let others sinne, and grieve; one cunning sleight Shall freeze my Love to Christall in a night. I can love first, and (if I winne) love still; And cannot be remov'd, unlesse she will. It is her fault if I unsure remaine, Shee onely can untie, I binde againe. The honesties of love with ease I doe, But am no porter for a tedious woe. But (madame) I now thinke on you; and here Where we are at our hights, you but appeare, We are but clouds, you rise from our noone-ray, But a foule shadow, not your breake of day. You are at first hand all that's faire and right, And others good reflects but backe your light. You are a perfectnesse, so curious hit, That youngest flatteries doe scandall it. For, what is more doth what you are restraine, And though beyond, is downe the hill againe. We have no next way to you, we crosse to it: You are the straight line, thing prais'd, attribute, Each good in you's a light; so many a shade You make, and in them are your motions made. These are your pictures to the life. From farre We see you move, and here your Zani's are: So that no fountaine good there is, doth grow In you, but our dimme actions faintly shew. Then finde I, if mans noblest part be love, Your purest luster must that shadow move. The soule with body, is a heaven combin'd With earth, and for mans ease, bur nearer joyn'd. Where thoughts the starres of soule we understand, We guesse not their large natures, but command. And love in you, that bountie is of light, That gives to all, and yet hath infinite. Whose heat doth force us thither to intend, But soule we finde too earthly to ascend, 'Till slow accesse hath made it wholy pure, Able immortall clearnesse to endure. Who dare aspire this journey with a staine, Hath waight will force him headlong backe againe. No more can impure man retaine and move In that pure region of a worthy love: Then earthly substance can unforc'd aspire, And leave his nature to converse with fire: Such may have eye, and hand; may sigh, may speak; But like swoln bubles, wh? they are high'st they break Though far removed Northerne fleets scarce finde The Sunnes comfort others thinke him too kinde. There is an equall distance from her eye, Men perish too farre off, and burne too nigh. But as ayre takes the Sunne-beames equall bright From the first Raves to his last opposite: So able man, blest with a vertuous Love, Remote or neare, or howsoe'r they move; There vertue breakes all clouds that might annoy, There is no Emptinesse, but all is Ioy. He much profanes whom valiant heats doe move To stile his wandring rage of passion, Love. Love that imparts in every thing delight, Is fancied Why love among the vertues is not knowne Is, that love is them all contracted one. A Dialogue betweene S? Henry Wotton, and M? Donne.The attribution of this poem is questionable. If her disdaine least change in you can move, you doe not love, For when the hope gives fuell to the fire, you sell desire. Love is not love, but given free, And so is mine, so should yours bee. Her heart that melts to heare of others moane, to mine is stone. Her eyes that weepe a strangers eyes to see, joy to wound mee: Yet I so well affect each part, As (caus'd by them) I love my smart. Say her disdaynings justly must begrac't with name of chaste. And that shee frownes least longing should exceed, and raging breed; So her disdaines can ne'r offend; Vnlesse selfe-love take private end. 'Tis love breeds love in mee, and cold disdaine kils that againe, As water causeth fire to fret and fume, till all consume. Who can of love more gift make, Then to love selfe for loves sake. I'll never dig in Quarry of an heart to have no part, Nor rest in fiery eyes, which alwayes are Canicular. Who this way would a Lover prove, May shew his patience, not his love. A frowne may be sometimes for physick good, But not for food; And for that raging humour there is sure A gentler Cure. Why barre you love of private end, Which never should to publique tend? To Ben. Iohnson, 6 Ian. 1603. The State and mens affaires are the best playes Next yours, 'Tis nor more nor lesse th? due praise. Write, but touch not the much descending race Of Lords houses, so settled in worths place. As but themselves none thinke them usurpers. It is no fault in thee to suffer theirs. Is the Queene Masque, or King a hunting goe, Though all the Court follow, Let them. We know Like them in goodnesse that Court ne'r will be, For that were vertue, and not flatterie. Forget we were thrust out. It is but thus God threatens Kings, Kings Lords, as Lords doe us, Iudge of strangers, Trust and believe your friend, And so me; And when I true friendship end, With guilty c?science let me be worse st?g, Then with Pophams sentence theeves, or Cookes tongue Traitors are. Friends are our selves. This I thee tell As to my friend, and to my selfe is Counsell: Let for a while the times unthrifty rout Contemne learning, and all your studies flout. Let them scorne Hell, they will a Sergeant feare, More than we them, that, ere long God may forbear, But Creditors will not. Let them increase In riot and excesse as their meanes cease, Let them scorne him that made them, and still shun His Grace, but love the whore who hath undone Them and their soules. But; that they that allow But one God, should have religions enough For the Queens Masque, &amp; their husbands, for more Then all the Gentiles knew, or Atlas bore. Well, let all passe, and trust him who nor cracks The bruised Reed, nor quencheth smoaking flaxe. To Ben. Iohnson, 9. Novembris, 1603.The attribution of this poem is questionable. If great men wrong me, I will spare my selfe; If meane, I will spare them, I know the pelfe. Which is ill got the Owner doth upbraide, It may corrupt a Iudge, make me afraid And a Iury. But 'twill revenge in this, That, though himselfe be judge, hee guilty is. What care I though of weaknesse men taxe me, I had rather sufferer than doer be. That I did trust it was my Natures praise, For breach of word I knew but as a phrase. That judgement is, that surely can comprise The world in precepts, most happy and most wise. What though? Though lesse, yet some of both have we, Who have learn'd it by use and misery. Poore I, whom every pety crosse doth trouble, Who apprehend each hurt thats done me, double, Am of this (though it should sinke me) carelesse, It would but force me to a stricter goodnesse They have great gaine of me, who gaine doe winne, (If such gaine be not losse) from every sinne. The standing of great mens lives would afford A pretty summe, if God would sell his Word. He cannot; they can theirs, and breake them too. How unlike they are that they are likened to? Yet I conclude, they are amidst my evils, If good, like Gods, the naught are so like devils. To Sir Tho. Rowe. 1603.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Deare Tom: Tell her if she to hired servants shew Dislike, before they take their leave they goe; When nobler spirits start at no disgrace, For who hath but one minde, hath but one face. If then why I take not my leave she aske, Aske her againe why she did not unmaske. Was she or proud or cruell, or knew shee 'Twould make my losse more felt, and pittyed me? Or did she feare one kisse might stay for moe? Or else was she unwilling I should goe? I thinke the best, and love so faithfully I cannot chuse but thinke that she loves mee. If this prove not my faith then let her trie How in her service I would fructifie. Ladies have boldly lov'd; bid her renew That decay'd worth, and prove the times past true. Then he whose wit and verse growes now so lame, With songs to her will the wild Irish tame. Howe'r, I'll weare the black and white ribband, White for her fortunes, blacke for mine shall stand. I doe esteeme her favour not the stuffe; If what I have was given, I have enough, And all's well, for had she lov'd, I had not had All my friends hate For now departing sad I feele not that: Yet as the Rack the Gout Cures, so hath this worse griefe that quite put out. My first disease nought but that worse cureth, Which (I dare foresay) nothing cures but death. Tell her all this before I am forgot, That not too late shee grieve shee lov'd me not. Burden'd with this, I was to depart lesse Willing then those which die, and not confesse. The end of the Letters. [Funerall Elegies.] Elegie on his Mistris. By our first strange and fatall interview By all desires which thereof did ensue, By our long starving hopes, by that remorse Which my words masculine perswasive force Begot in thee, and by the memory Of hurts, which spies and rivals threatned me, I calmely beg. But by thy fathers wrath, By all paines, which want and divorcement hath, I conjure thee, and all the oathes which I And thou have sworne to seale joynt constancy, Here I unsweare, and overswear them thus, Thou shalt not love by wayes so dangerous. Temper, ô faire Love, loves impetuous rage, Be my true Mistris still, not my faign'd Page; I'll goe, and, by thy kinde leave, leave behinde Thee, onely worthy to nurse in my minde, Thirst to come backe; ô if thou die before, My soule from other lands to thee shall soare, Thy (else Almighty) beautie cannot move Rage from the Seas, nor thy love teach them love, Nor tame wilde Boreas harshnesse; Thou hast reade How roughly hee in peeces shivered Faire Orithea, whom he swore he lov'd. Fall ill or good, 'tis madnesse to have prov'd Dangers unurg'd; Feed on this flattery, That absent Lovers one in th'other be. Dissemble nothing, not a boy, nor change Thy bodies habite, nor minde, bee not strange To thy selfe onely. All will spie in thy face A blushing womanly discovering grace Richly cloath'd Apes, are call'd Apes, and as soone Ecclips'd as bright we call the Moone the Moone, Men of France, changeable Camelions, Spittles of diseases, shops of fashions, Loves fuellers, and the rightest company Of Players, which upon the worlds stage be, Will quickly know thee, and no lesse, alas! Th'indifferent Italian, as we passe His warme land, well content to thinke thee Page Will hunt thee with such lust, and hideous rage, As Lots faire guests were vext. But none of these Nor spungy hydroptique Dutch shall thee displease, If thou stay here. O stay here, for, for thee England is onely a worthy Gallerie, To walke in expectation, till from thence Our greatest King call thee to his presence, When I am gone, dreame me some happinesse, Nor let thy lookes our long hid love confesse, Nor praise, nor dispraise me, nor blesse nor curse Openly loves force, nor in bed fright thy Nurse With midnights startings, crying out, oh, oh Nurse, ô my love is slaine, I saw him goe O'r the white Alpes alone; I saw him I, Assail'd, fight, taken, stabb'd, bleed, fall, and die. Augure me better chance, except dread Iove Thinke it enough for me to'have had thy love. Elegie. [That I might make your Cabinet my tombe] MADAME, That I might make your Cabinet my tombe, And for my fame which I love next my soule, Next to my soule provide the happiest roome, Admit to that place this last funerall Scrowle. Others by Wills give Legacies, but I Dying, of you doe beg a Legacie. My fortune and my will this custome breake, When we are senselesse grown to make stones speak, Though no stone tell thee what I was, yet thou In my graves inside see what thou art now, Yet th'art not yet so good; till us death lay To ripe and mellow there, w'are stubborne clay, Parents make us earth, and soules dignifie Vs to be glasse, here to grow gold we lie; Whilst in our soules sinne bred and pampered is, Our soules become worme-eaten Carkasses. [Divine Poems.] Holy Sonnets. I. [Thou hast made me, And shall thy worke decay] Thou hast made me, And shall thy worke decay, Repaire me now, for now mine end doth haste, I runne to death, and death meets me as fast, And all my pleasures are like yesterday, I dare not move my dimme eyes any way, Despaire behind, and death before doth cast Such terrour, and my feeble flesh doth waste By sinne in it, which it t'wards hell doth weigh; Onely thou art above, and when towards thee By thy leave I can looke, I rise againe; But our old subtle foe so tempteth me, That not one houre my selfe I can sustaine, Thy Grace may wing me to prevent his art And thou like Adamant draw mine iron heart. III. [O might those sighes and teares returne againe] O might those sighes and teares returne againe Into my breast and eyes, which I have spent, That I might in this holy discontent Mourne with some fruit, as I have mourn'd in vaine; In mine Idolatry what showres of raine Mine eyes did waste? what griefs my heart did rent? That sufferance was my sinne I now repent, 'Cause I did suffer I must suffer paine. Th'hydroptique drunkard, &amp; night-scouting thiefe, The itchy Lecher, and selfe tickling proud Have the remembrance of past joyes, for reliefe Of comming ills: To (poore) me is allow'd No ease; for, long, yet vehement griefe hath beene Th'effect and cause, the punishment and sinne. V. [I am a little world made cunningly] I am a little world made cunningly Of Elements, and an Angelike spright, But black sinne hath betraid to endlesse night My worlds both parts, and (oh) both parts must die. You which beyond that heav? which was most high Have found new sphears, and of new land can write, Powre new seas in mine eyes, that so I might Drowne my world with my weeping earnestly, Or wash it if it must be drown'd no more: But oh it must be burnt, alas the fire Of lust and envie burnt it heretofore, And made it fouler, Let their flames retire, And burne me ô Lord, with a fiery zeale Of thee and thy house, which doth in eating heale. VIII. [If faithfull soules be alike glorifi'd] If faithfull soules be alike glorifi'd As Angels, then my fathers soule doth see, And adds this even to full felicitie, That valiantly I hels wide mouth o'rstride: But if our mindes to these soules be descry'd By circumstances, and by signes that be Apparent in us not immediately, How shall my mindes white truth by them be try'd? They see idolatrous lovers weepe and mourne, And stile blasphemous Conjurers to call On Iesus name, and Pharisaicall Dissemblers feigne devotion. Then turne O pensive soule, to God, for he knowes best Thy griefe, for he put it into my breast. On the blessed Virgin Mary. In that, ô Queene of Queenes, thy birth was free From that which others doth of grace bereave, When in their mothers wombe they life receive, God, as his sole-borne daughter loved thee. To match thee like thy births nobilitie, He thee his Spirit for his spouse did leave, By whom thou didst his onely sonne conceive, And so wast link'd to all the Trinitie. Cease then, ô Queenes, that earthly Crownes doe weare, To glory in the Pompe of earthly things; If men such high respects unto you beare, Which daughters, wives, &amp; mothers are of kings, What honour can unto that Queene be done Who had your God for Father, Spouse and Sonne? Vpon the tr?slation of the Psalmes by Sir Philip Sydney, and the Countesse of Pembroke his Sister. Eternall God, (for whom who ever dare Seeke new expressions, doe the Circle square, And thrust into strait corners of poore wit Thee, who art cornerlesse and infinite) I would but blesse thy Name, not name thee now; (And thy gifts are as infinite as thou:) Fixe we our prayses therefore on this one, That, as thy blessed Spirit fell upon These Psalmes first Author in a cloven tongue; (For 'twas a double power by which he sung The highest matter in the noblest forme;) So thou hast cleft that spirit, to performe That worke againe, and shed it, here, upon Two, by their bloods, and by thy Spirit one; A Brother and a Sister, made by thee The Organ, where thou art the Harmony. Two that make one Iohn Baptists holy voyce, And who that Psalme, Now let the Jles rejoyce, Have both translated, and apply'd it too, Both told us what, and taught us how to doe. They shew us Ilanders our joy, our King, They tell us why, and teach us how to sing. Make all this All, 3 Quires, heaven, earth, &amp; sphears; The first, Heaven, hath a song, but no man heares, The Spheares have Musick, but they have no tongue, Their harmony is rather danc'd than sung; But our third Quire, to which the first gives eare, (For, Angels learne by what the Church does heare) This Quire hath all. The Organist is hee Who hath tun'd God and Man, the Organ we: The songs are these, which heavens high holy Muse Whisper'd to David, David to the Iewes: And Davids Successors, in holy zeale, In formes of joy and art doe re-reveale To us so sweetly and sincerely too, That I must not rejoyce as I would doe When I behold that these Psalmes are become So well attyr'd abroad, so ill at home, So well in Chambers, in thy Church so ill, As I can scarce call that reform'd untill This be reform'd; Would a whole State present A lesser gift than some one man hath sent? And shall our Church, unto our Spouse and King More hoarse, more harsh than any other, sing? For that we pray, we praise thy name for this, Which, by thy Moses and this Miriam, is Already done; and as those Psalmes we call (Though some have other Authors) Davids all: So though some have, some may some Psalmes translate, We thy Sydnean Psalmes shall celebrate, And, till we come th'Extemporall song to sing, (Learn'd the first hower, that we see the King, Who hath translated those translators) may These their sweet learned labours, all the way Be as our tuning, that, when hence we part We may fall in with them, and sing our part. Ode. [Vengeance will sit above our faults; but till] 1 Vengeance will sit above our faults; but till She there doth sit, We see her not, nor them. Thus, blinde, yet still We leade her way; and thus, whil'st we doe ill, We suffer it. 2 Vnhappy he, whom youth makes not beware Of doing ill. Enough we labour under age, and care; In number, th'errours of the last place, are The greatest still. 3 Yet we, that should the ill we now begin As soone repent, (Str?ge thing!) perceive not; our faults are not seen, But past us; neither felt, but onely in The punishment. 4 But we know our selves least; Mere outward shews Our mindes so store, That our soules, no more than our eyes disclose But forme and colour. Onely he who knowes Himselfe, knowes more. I. D. To M? Tilman after he had taken orders. Thou, whose diviner soule hath caus'd thee now To put thy hand unto the holy Plough, Making Lay-scornings of the Ministry, Not an impediment, but victory; What bringst thou home with thee? how is thy mind Affected since the vintage? Dost thou finde New thoughts and stirrings in thee? and as Steele Toucht with a Loadstone, dost new motions feele? Or, as a Ship after much paine and care, For Iron and Cloth brings home rich Indian ware, Hast thou thus traffiqu'd, but with farre more gaine Of noble goods, and with lesse time and paine? Thou art the same materials, as before, Onely the stampe is changed; but no more. And as new crowned Kings alter the face, But not the monies substance; so hath grace Chang'd onely Gods old Image by Creation, To Chists new stampe, at this thy Coronation; Or, as we paint Angels with wings, because They beare Gods message and proclaime his lawes, Since thou must doe the like, and so must move, Art thou new feather'd with cœlestiall love? Deare, tell me where thy purchase lies, and shew What thy advantage is above, below. But if thy gainings doe surmount expression, Why doth the foolish world scorne that profession, Whose joyes passe speech? Why do they think unfit That Gentry should joyne families with it? As if their day were onely to be spent In dressing, Mistressing and complement; Alas poore joyes, but poorer men, whose trust Seemes richly placed in sublimed dust; (For, such are cloathes and beauty, which though gay, Are, at the best, but of sublimed clay) Let then the world thy calling disrespect, But goe thou on, and pitty their neglect. What function is so noble, as to bee Embassadour to God and destinie? To open life, to give kingdomes to more Than Kings give dignities; to keepe heavens doore?
