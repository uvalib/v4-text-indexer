      <field name="fulltext">On Loyalty. A POEM IN LATIN SENT TO “DEAR TOBY” (PROBABLY MR. CLOTWORTHY ROWLEY) IN 1754. Since kings sustain the burdens of the state, No pleasant hours, no leisure for the great. Since the uneasy head which wears a crown The threatenings of impending wars weigh down, Why do the people rage with murmurs dark Ready to fall on him who steers the bark? 'Tis his to watch, attent to every call Lest any burden on his people fall. 'Tis Satan leads astray with devilish art For Satan ever takes the fouler part. Nay, rather, be the people's love his due Who to his people's love is always true, Him let the nations love and guard and bless, Whom, loving, guarding, blessing, all confess. But thou, if such thou art, who dar'st with ill To curse that sacred head—Oh, “Peace be still.” Truth to the king may meet with rare reward, Think not his claim on thee is therefore barred, Approve thyself praiseworthy—that is best, Only deserving, loyal souls can rest. A Song of Mercy and Judgment. WRITTEN AT ST. ALBANS IN 1764, AFTER THE POET'S RECOVERY. I Lord, I love the habitation Where the Saviour's honour dwells. At the sound of Thy salvation With delight my bosom swells. Grace Divine, how sweet the sound, Sweet the grace that I have found. II Me thro' waves of deep affliction, Dearest Saviour! Thou hast brought, Fiery deeps of sharp conviction Hard to bear and passing thought. Sweet the sound of grace Divine, Sweet the grace which makes me Thine. III From the cheerful Beams of morning Sad I turned mine eyes away: And the shades of night returning Filled my soul with new dismay. Grace Divine, &amp;c. IV Food I loathed, nor ever tasted But by violence constrained. Strength decay'd and body wasted Spoke the terrors I sustained. Sweet the sound, &amp;c. V Bound and watch'd, lest Life abhorring, I should my own death procure, For to me the Pit of Roaring Seem'd more easy to endure. Grace Divine, &amp;c. VI Fear of Thee, with gloomy sadness, Overwhelm'd Thy guilty worm, Till reduced to moping madness, Reason sank beneath the storm. Sweet the sound, &amp;c. VII Then, what soul-distressing noises Seemed to reach me from below, Visionary scenes and voices, Flames of Hell, and screams of woe! Grace Divine, &amp;c. VIII But at length a word of Healing, Sweeter than an angel's note, From the Saviour's lips distilling, Chas'd despair and chang'd my lot. Sweet the sound, &amp;c. IX 'Twas a word well-timed and suited To the need of such an hour, Sweet to one like me polluted, Spoke in love and sealed with power. X “I,” He said, “have seen thee grieving, Lov'd thee as I passed thee by. Be not faithless, but Believing, Look and live and never die. XI “Take the bloody seal I give thee, Deep impressed upon thy soul; God, thy God will now receive thee, Faith hath sav'd thee, thou art whole.” Grace Divine, &amp;c. XII All at once, my chains were broken, From my feet my fetters fell, And that word, in pity spoken, Snatched me from the gates of Hell. Grace Divine, &amp;c. XIII Since that hour, in hope of glory, With Thy foll'wers I am found, And relate the wond'rous story To Thy list'ning saints around. Sweet the sound of grace Divine, Sweet the grace which makes me Thine. A Thunder Storm. The Sky begins to lower and thickening Clouds Portend a speedy storm, the Vocal tribes No longer Sonnets sing; all, all are mute; The Beasts forbear to graze and seek the shade: Yon herd of Swine see, see how fast they run; 'Tis said they see the Wind— A solemn and awful silence now prevails, Save when the breeze the Thunder's harbinger Just rustles through the Grove: on ev'ry brow A dark despondence reigns, and hark! it comes; I heard the sudden roar,—my Soul, be calm, Look up and view its progress, be serene, Calm and collected, as becomes a Man. Again it roars—and now the Lightning flies; Not faster flies the timid Hare from Hounds; Nor from the Victor flies the vanquished Foe, Than Travellers seek for Shelter, e'en my Dog Cow'rs at my feet and looks up for protection, And now 'tis dreadful truly—Heav'n and Earth How hard it rains! the Atmosphere's on fire! Chaos presides! Confusion quite surrounds me! Yet, yet again the broad expanded glare Of vivid Lightning flashes o'er the Plain Leaving a sulph'rous stench; Heav'ns what a Peal! Still; still it roars incessant! What to this The din of armies on the hostile Plain? An Atom to a Mountain.— See the sky opens—shuts—and forky fires Dart oblique to the Earth; and o'er my Head Tempest rides forward on the Whirlwind's wing: Still the Almighty flashes for his Spear; His Chariot wheels most awfully resound: Well! be it so my Soul, consoling thought! He is thy maker and I trust thy friend; Then wherefore tremble, wherefore shudder thus? No, I will cease to fear, tho' even now The Ear of Nature feels so strong a Shock As scarce before it felt: Yet as a Man, A Christian Man, I shudder now no more. When God in Thunder spoke from Sinai's mount, Israel approached with Awe, if Moses then Could mediate for the People, and avert The great Jehovah's anger, sure his Son, The fam'd Immanuel, the Prince of Peace, Can ransom from his wrath and reconcile. But oh! my Soul how poor a Portrait this! How weak the Colours and how faint th'Idea, Of what one day thou must be a Spectator! Oh! bright and blessed morning to the Just! Oh! Day of doom of infinite distress; To those who unprepar'd Messiah meet; When thron'd in Clouds, surrounded by the Host Of Heav'n, worshipping, the Judge descends: Consummate Triumph. Hark! the Trumpet sounds, The Breath of Michael blows the Amazing blast; The Dead arise, the Living all are Chang'd, And Adam's family appear before Him— Amid that throng—in that Assembly vast, Must thou my soul appear and there receive A Plaudit glorious or Silence sad: Sink deep in Thought, Oh, deeper, deeper still: May it ne'er be forgotten, on my Couch Be it my dreaming subject, when awake, Oh! be it still remembered: for its worth What tongue can speak, or any language tell? Then from this hour deep on my heart engraved Be all my duty needful; Ha! that blaze That Shock tremendous that appals me thus Says I am not prepar'd—but I submit; No more will I rebel against thy sway Nor dispute thy dominion Gracious God! My sins shall suffer and by Grace divine I will forsake them all and trust alone For true felicity, for pleasure high To Thee: who only can true pleasure give. The Storm abates—less too the Thunder roars, The Vault of Heav'n grows brighter, and the Sun Strives to Emerge from yonder dusky Cloud, More faint the flashes grow—and distant fly, Nature resumes her charms, and from the Grove Musick again is heard: the Warblers there Attempt a feeble strain: the Dog Star now Throws his warm beams around the weeping Scene; Salubrious Zephyrs gently fan the Air: Love, Life, and Joy return by due degrees And Harmony once more revisits Earth. Heu! Quam Remotus. A translation of Cowper's Latin verse by Alfred Gough. Far from my natal roof I sigh, Of all its joys, alas! bereft, Since long ago, so thoughtlessly, Sweet fields and home and friends I left; And thee forsook, for whom mine eyes Weep sore, more loved than limb or life, And linked to me by closest ties, A victim trembling 'neath the knife. Yet no fierce monster was I born, No lioness e'er nourished me, In some rude cave o'erhung with thorn; No!—this is Destiny's decree. My soul by countless terrors riven, And like the stormy ocean tossed, Into Avernus' jaws was driven, In its black stream for ever lost. On the Trial of Admiral Keppel. (END OF 1778.) Keppel, returning from afar With laurels on his brow, Comes home to wage a sharper war, And with a fiercer foe. The blow was raised with cruel aim, And meant to pierce his heart, But lighting on his well-earned fame Struck an immortal part. Slander and Envy strive to tear His wreath so justly won, But Truth, who made his cause her care, Has bound it faster on. The charge that was design'd to sound The signal of disgrace, Has only called a navy round To praise him to his face. An Address to the Mob on Occasion of the late Riot at the House of Sir Hugh Palliser. (END OF 1788.) And is it thus, ye base and blind, And fickle as the shifting wind, Ye treat a warrior staunch and true, Grown old in combating for you? Can one false step and made in haste Thus cancel every service past? And have ye all at once forgot (As whose deservings have ye not?) That Palliser, like Keppel brave, Has baffled France on yonder wave; And when his country asked the stake Has pledged his life for England's sake! Though now he sink, oppressed with shame, Forgetful of his former fame, Yet Keppel with deserv'd applause Proclaims him bold in Britain's cause, And to his well-known courage pays The tribute of heroic praise— Go learn of him, whom ye adore, Whose name now sets you in a roar, Whom ye were more than half prepar'd To pay with just the same reward, To render praise where praise is due, To keep his former deeds in view Who fought and would have died for you. The Bee and the Pineapple. (PROBABLY SEPTEMBER, 1779.) A bee, allured by the perfume Of a rich pineapple in bloom, Found it within a frame enclosed, And licked the glass that interposed. Blossoms of apricot and peach, The flowers that blowed within his reach, Were arrant drugs compared with that He strove so vainly to get at No rose could yield so rare a treat, Nor jessamine were half so sweet. The gard'ner saw this much-ado (The gardener was the master too), And thus he said: “Poor restless bee! I learn philosophy from thee. I learn how just it is and wise, To use what Providence supplies, To leave fine titles, lordships, graces, Rich pensions, dignities, and places— Those gifts of a superior kind— To those for whom they were designed. I learn that comfort dwells alone In that which Heaven has made our own, That fools incur no greater pain Than pleasure coveted in vain.” Another on the Same. The pineapples, in triple row, Were basking hot, and all in blow. A bee of most deserving taste Perceived the fragrance as he passed, On eager wing the spoiler came, And searched for crannies in the frame, Urged his attempt on every side, To every pane his trunk applied; But still in vain, the frame was tight, And only pervious to the light: Thus having wasted half the day, He trimmed his flight another way. Methinks, I said, in thee I find The sin and madness of mankind. To joys forbidden man aspires, Consumes his soul with vain desires; Folly the spring of his pursuit, And disappointment all the fruit. While Cynthio ogles, as she passes, The nymph between two chariot glasses, She is the pineapple, and he The silly unsuccessful bee. The maid who views with pensive air The showglass fraught with glittering ware, Sees watches, bracelets, rings, and lockets, But sighs at thought of empty pockets; Like thine, her appetite is keen, But ah, the cruel glass between! Our dear delights are often such, Exposed to view, but not to touch; The sight our foolish heart inflames, We long for pineapples in frames; With hopeless wish one looks and lingers; One breaks the glass, and cuts his fingers; But they whom Truth and Wisdom lead, Can gather honey from the weed. Anti-thelyphthora, or The Doves. (JUNE 5, 1780.) ACCOMPANYING A LETTER TO MRS. NEWTON. Muse, mark the much lamented day, When like a Tempest feared, First issuing on the last of May “Thelyphthora” appeared. That fatal eve I wandered late And heard the voice of love; The turtle thus address'd her mate, And soothed the listening dove: “Our mutual bond of faith and truth No time shall disengage, Those blessings of our early youth Shall cheer our latest age: “While innocence without disguise, And constancy sincere, Shall fill the circles of those eyes, And mine can read them there: “Those ills, that wait on all below, Shall ne'er be left by me, Or gently felt, and only so, As being shared by thee. “When lightnings flash among the trees, Or kites are hovering near, I fear lest thee alone they seize, And know no other fear. “'Tis then I feel myself a wife, And press thy wedded side, Resolved a union form'd for life Death never shall divide. “But oh! if fickle and unchaste (Forgive a transient thought), Thou could'st become unkind at last, And scorn thy present lot, “No need of lightnings from on high, Or kites with cruel beak; Denied the endearments of thine eye, This widow'd heart would break.” Thus sang the sweet sequester'd bird, Soft as the passing wind, And I recorded what I heard, A lesson for mankind. Tom Raban. (AUGUST 31, 1780.) The curate and churchwarden, And eke exciseman too, Have treated poor Tom Raban As if he was a Jew. For they have sent him packing, No more in church to work, Whatever may be lacking; As if he was a Turk. Thus carry they the farce on, Which is great cause of grief, Until that Page, the parson, Turn over a new leaf. Thus says the muse, and though her fav'rite cue Is fiction, yet her song is sometimes true. The Cancelled Passage in Expostulation. (FEBRUARY, 1781.) “Hast thou admitted, with a blind, fond trust, The lie that burned my father's bones to dust, That first adjudged them heretics, then sent Their souls to heaven and cursed them as they went? The lie that Scripture strips of its disguise, And execrates above all other lies, The lie that claps a lock on mercy's plan, And gives the key to yon infirm old man, Who once ensconced in apostolic chair Is deified, and sits omniscient there; The lie that knows no kindred, owns no friend But him that makes its progress his chief end, That having spilt much blood, makes that a boast, And canonizes him that sheds the most? Away with charity that soothes a lie, And thrusts the truth with scorn and anger by; Shame on the candour and the gracious smile Bestowed on them that light the martyr's pile, While insolent disdain in frowns expressed Attends the tenets that endured the test! Grant them rights of men, and while they cease To vex the peace of others grant them peace: But trusting bigots whose false zeal has made Treachery their duty, thou art self-betrayed.” The Degeneracy of the Clergy. WRITTEN ON A LACE-BUYER'S BILL. (POSSIBLY EXCISED FROM THE “PROGRESS OF ERROR.”) Methinks I see thee decently arrayed In long-flowed nightgown of stuff damask made, Thy cassock underneath it closely braced With surcingle about thy moderate waist. Thy morning wig, grown tawny to the view, Though once a grizzle, and thy square-toed shoe. The day was when the sacerdotal race Esteemed their proper habit no disgrace, Or rather when the garb their order wears Was not disgraced as now by being theirs. The Love of God the End of Life. (August, 1782.) Since we must sorrow and why not? For me I wish no gentler lot, But meekly wait my last remove, Seeking only growth in love. No bliss I seek, but to fulfil In life, in death, Thy lovely will; No succours in my woes I want, Save what Thou art pleased to grant. Our days are numbered, let us spare Our anxious hearts a needless care; 'Tis Thine to number out our days; Ours to give them to Thy praise. Love is our only business here, Love simple, constant, and sincere, O blessed days Thy servants see Spent, O Lord! in pleasing Thee. Against Interested Love. (PROBABLY 1782.) Who does not blush when charged with selfish views Man boasts for man a principle of love; But each with God a different course pursues, And interest is the spring by which they move. Oh, blindness of our mean and stupid race! The selfish and the sordid we despise, And yet the love of God incurs disgrace, While love to man is sounded to the skies. How speaks the world?—in Friendship's sacred cause A generous service is its own reward, A maxim all have stamped with their applause, How speaks the world? My dear and valued friend My recompense is found in serving you. To a Lady (Lady Austen) WHO WORE A LOCK OF HIS HAIR SET WITH DIAMONDS. (ABOUT 1784.) The star that beams on Anna's breast Conceals her William's hair; 'Twas lately severed from the rest To be promoted there. The heart that beats beneath that breast Is William's well I know, A nobler prize and richer far Than India could bestow. She thus his favoured lock prefers To make her William shine; The ornament indeed is hers, But all the honour mine. To a Young Lady (Miss Ann Green). WITH A PRESENT OF TWO COXCOMBS. (PERHAPS ABOUT 1784.) Two powdered Coxcombs wait at your command, And what is strange, both dressed by Nature's hand, Like other fops they dread a sudden shower And seek a shelter in your closest bower, Showy like them, like them they yield no fruit, But then to make amends they both are mute. The Critics Chastised. Written on a Page of “The Monthly Review.” (1784.) These critics, who to faith no quarter grant, But call it mere hypocrisy and cant To make a just acknowledgment of praise, And thanks to God for governing our ways, Approve Confucius more, and Zoroaster, Than Christ's own servant, or that servant's Master. Box and Bays. (FEB. 2, 1791.) Dear Tom! my muse this moment sounds your praise, And turns at once your sprig of box to bays.” To Sir John Fenn. (The first editor of the Paston Letters.) (MAY 20, 1792.) Two omens seem propitious to my fame, Your spouse embalms my verse and you my name, A name which, all self-flatt'ry far apart, Belongs to one who venerates in his heart The wise and good, and therefore of the few Known by those titles, Sir, both yours and you. Morsels. DEVOID OF LITERARY MERIT. THE MUSLIN IS FOUND. (At the end of a letter to Unwin, June 8, 1783.) The muslin is found, the gown is admired, Procure us some franks—adieu, I am tired. THE HAMPER. We have received beef, tongues, and tea, And certainly from none but thee; Therefore with all our power of lungs, Thanks for beef, and tea, and tongues. HAYLEY'S PORTRAIT. (NOVEMBER 25, 1792.) Achilles and Hector and Homer and all When your face appears shall come down from the wall, And mine, theme of many an angry remark, Shall then hide its pickpocket looks in the dark. AN EPIGRAM. [An epigram is but a feeble thing] An epigram is but a feeble thing With straw in tale, stuck there by way of sting.</field>
