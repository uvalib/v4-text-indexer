[The Latin side-notes in italics and Clarendon, and the stops of the text in parentheses (), are those of the MS.] Herkeneþ, þat loueþ honour, Of kyng Arthour &amp; hys labour; And furst how he was bygete, As þat we in bokis do rede. Vther pendragon was hys fader, And ygerne was hys Moder. Pendragon ys in walysch ‘Dragones heed’ on Englysch He maked ypeynted dragons two; Oon schold byfore him goo Whan he went to batayle, Whan he wold hys foes sayle; That other abood at wynchester, Euer-more stylle there. Bretones ?af hym þat Name, Vther Pendragon þe same, For þat skyle fer &amp; nere Euer-more hyt to bere. The Erles wyff of Cornewayle He loued to Muche san? fayle; Merlyn wyþ hys sotelnesse Turned vtheris lyknesse, And maked hym lyche þe Erl anone, And wyþ hys wyff (:) his wyll to done In þe countre of Cornewell: In þe Castel of Tyntagell, Thus vther, yf y schall nat lye, Bygat Arthour in avowtrye. Whan vther Pendragon was deed, Arthour anon was y-crowned; He was courteys, large, &amp; Gent To alle puple verrament; Beaute, My?t, amyable chere To alle Men ferre and neere; Hys port (;) hys ?yftes gentyll Maked hym y-loved wyll; Ech mon was glad of hys presence, And drade to do hym dysplesance; A stronger Man of hys honde was neuer founde on any londe, As courteys as any Mayde:— Þus wryteþ of hym þat hym a-sayde. At Cayrlyon wythoute fable, He let make þe Rounde table: And why þat he maked hyt þus, Þis was þe resoun y-wyss,— Þat no man schulde sytt aboue other, Ne haue indignacioun of hys broþer; And alle hadde (.)oo(.) seruyse, For no pryde scholde aryse For any degree of syttynge, Oþer for any seruynge: Þus he kept þe table Rounde Whyle he leuyd on þe grounde. After he hadde conquered Skotlond Yrland &amp; Gotland, Þan leuyd he at þe best Twelf ?eeris on alle reste Wyþoute werre (:) tyll at þe laste He þou?t to make (.)a(.) nywe conqueste. Into Fraunce wyþ gode counceyle he wolde weende (:) &amp; hyt assayle, Þat Rome þo kept vnder Myght, Vnder Frollo (:) a worthy knyght Þat fraunce hadde þo to kepe, To rywle, defende, &amp; to lede. Arthour and Frollo fow?t in feld; Þere deyde many vnder scheld. Frollo in-to Paryss fly, Wyth strenkthe kept hyt wysely: Arthour byseged þat Syte &amp; town Tyll þeire vytayl was y-doon. Frollo þat worthy knyght Proferyd wyth Arthour for to fyght Vnder þis wyse &amp; condicioun,— “Ho hadde þe Maystrie (:) haue þe crown; And no mo men but þey two.” Þe day was sett (:) to-geder þey go: Fayr hyt was to byholde In suche two kny?ghte? bolde: Þer was no word y-spoke, But eche hadde other by þe þrote; Þey smote wyth trounchoun &amp; wyth swerd; Þat hyt seye, were a-ferd; Frollo fow?t wyþ hys ax (:) as men dude se; He hytt Arthour (:) so sore (:) þat he felle on kne. He ros vp raply (:) and smot hym full sore; He dude hym to grent a (.) soue? þerfore. Thus they hyw on helmes hye, And schatered on wyþ scheldes. Þe puple by-gan to crye Þat stood on þe feldes; Ther ne wyst no man, as y can lere, Who of ham two was þe bettere þere. Arthour was chafed &amp; wexed wroth, He hente brounsteell / and to Frollo goth; Caliburnus Arthuri GladiusBrounstell was heuy &amp; also kene; Fram þe schulder (:) to þe syde went bytwene Off frollo / and þan he fell to þe grounde Ry?t as he moste / deed (.) in lyte stounde. Frensch men made doell &amp; wept full faste; Þeir Crowne of fraunce þere þey loste. Than wente Arthour in-to paryse And toke þe castell &amp; þe town at hys avyse. Worschuped be god of hys grete grace Þat þus ?eueþ fortune (:) and worschup to þe Reme; Thanke ?e hym all þat beþ on þis place, And seyeþ a Pater noster wythout any Beeme. Pater noster. Arthour fram Paryse went wyth hys Rowte, And conquered þe Contre on euery syde aboute; Angeoy, Peytow, Berry, &amp; Gaskoyne, Nauerne, Burgon / Loreyn &amp; Toreyne; He daunted þe proude / &amp; hawted þe poure; He dwelt long in Paryss after in honoure; He was drad and loued in contreis abowte; Heyest &amp; lowest hym Loved &amp; alowte; And vp-on an Estour tyme sone afterward He fested hys knyghtis &amp; ?af ham gret reward; To hys Styward he ?af Angers &amp; Angeye; To Bedewer hys botyler he ?af Normandye; He ?af to Holdyne flaundrys parde; To Borel hys Cosyn, Boloyne þe Cyte; And eche man, after þe astat þat he was, He rewarded hem alle, boþe More &amp; lasse, And ?af hem reward, boþe lond and Fee, And turned to Breteyn, to Carlyon ayhe. Arthour wolde of honour Hold a fest at Eestour Of regayle &amp; worthynesse, And feede alle hys frendess; And sende Messanger To kynges ferre &amp; neer Þat were to hym Omager, to come to þis Dyner. And alle at oo certeyn day They come þyder in gode aray, And kept þeire Ceson At þe Castell Carlyon.

Of by?onde þe See also Many lorde? were þere þo. Now resteþ alle wyþ Me, And say a Pater &amp; Aue. Pater noster. The þrydde day folowyng Then coom nywe tydynge, Þe whyle þey sete at þe Mete Messagers were In ylete; Well arayd forsoþe þey come, Y-send fram cite of Rome Wyþ lettres of þe Emperoures Whas name was Lucies. Lucius. Þes lettres were opened &amp; vnfold, And þe tydyng to alle men told, Whas sentence, yf y ne lye, Was after þat y can aspye: Litera Lucii imperatoris. Lucius þe grete Emperour To hys Enemy Arthour:— We wondereþ of þi wodeness And also of þy Madnesse! How darst þow any wyse A?enst the Emperour þus aryse, And ryde on Remes on eche wey, And make kynge? to þe obey? Þu art wood on þe Nolle! Þu hast Scley owre cosyn frolle; Þu schalt be taw?t at a schort day for to make such aray. Oure cosyn Iulius cesar Somme tyme conquered þar; To Rome þu owest hys trybut; We chargeþ þe to paye vs hyt. Thy pryde we woll alaye Þat makest so gret aray: We commandeþ þe on haste To paye owre trybut faste; Þu hast scley frolle in fraunce Þat hadde vnder vs þere gouernaunce, And wyþholdest oure tribute þerto: Þu schalt be taw?t þu hast mysdo: We commandeþ þe in haste soone Þat þu come to vs at Rome To vnderfang oure ordynaunce For þy dysobediaunce; As þu wold nat le?e þy lyf, Fulfylle þys wythoute stryff.” Whan þis lettre was open &amp; rad, Þe bretons &amp; all men were mad, And wolde þe messager scle:— “Nay,” seyd Arthour, “per de, That were a?enst all kynde, A messager to bete or bynde; Y charge alle men here For to make ham good chere.” And after Mete san? fayl Wyþ hys lordes he hadde counsayl; And alle asented þer-to, Arthour to Rome scholde go; And þey ne wolde in hys trauayle Wyþ strenkþ &amp; good neuer fayle. Than Arthour wroot to Rome a lettre, Was sentence was somm-what byttere, And seyde in þis manere As ?e may hure here:— Litera Regis Arthuri.“Knoweþ well ?e of Romayne, Y am kyng Arthour of Bretayne.

Also Maximian kyng of Bretaingne Co[n]quered al france &amp; Almayne, Lombardye, Rome, &amp; ytalye— By ?oure bokis ?e may a-spye. Y am þeir Eyr &amp; þeyre lynage, Y aske ?ow my trywage.” Þis lettre was celyd fast, Y-take the Messagere? on hast; Arthour ?af ham ?yfte? grete, And chered ham wyþ drynk and Mete. Þey hasted ham to come hoom; Byfor þe Emperour þey beþ coom; Saluted hym as reson ys, And toke hym þes letterys. Þey seyde to þe Emperour “We have be wyþ kyng Arthour; But such anoþer as he ys oon, Say neuer no Man. He ys serued on hys howshold Wyþ kynges, Erles, worthy &amp; bold; Hys worthynesse, sur Emperour, Passeþ Much all ?owre; He seyde he wolde hyder come And take trywage of all Rome, We dowteþ last he wol do soo, For he ys Myghty ynow þer-too.” Now, erst þan we goo ferþer, Every man þat ys here Sey a Pater noster And ave wyþ gode chere. Amen. Pater noster Ave Maria. Now stureth hym self Arthour Þenkyng on hys labour, And gaderyþ to hym strenghth aboute, Hys kynges &amp; Erles on a rowte— A fayr sy?t to Mannes ye To see such a cheualrye,— The kyng of Gotland, Also þe kyng of Irland, The kyng of ysland / &amp; of Orkenye, Þis was worthy Maynye; The kyng of Denmark also was þere, Þis was a worthy chere: Eche of þese vyve at her venyw Brou?t zyx þousand at har retenyw; xxx??. þowsand, ych vnderstand, Þes vyf kyngis hadde on honde.

Ther coom a gyant out of spayne, And rauasched had fayr Elayne; He had brou?t heor vp on an hulle— Mornyng hyt ys to hure or telle— Cosyn heo was to kyng Hoell, A damesel fayr and gentell; And ?ut ferþermore to, He rauasched heore Moder also. He dude þe damesel for to dye, For he myght not lygge heor bye. Whan þis was told to Artour, He maked Much dolour, And send Bedewer for to spye How he myght come hym bye; And he was nat Sclowh, But to þe hulle hym drowh Þat Closed was wyþ water stronge, Þe hulle a-Mydde gret &amp; longe; He went ouer to þe hulle syde, And þere a fonde a womman byde, Þat sorwedd &amp; wept Mornynge For Eleynes deþ &amp; departynge, And bad Bedewer to fle also Last he were ded more to; “For yf þe Gyant fynde þe, Wythoute dowte he wyll þe scle.” Bedwer wyþ all hastynge Tolde Arthour all þis þynge. Amorwe whan þat hyt was day Arthour toke þyder hys way, Bedewer wyþ hym wente, &amp; keye,— Men þat cowþe well þe weye,— And broute Arthour Meyntenant Euen byfore þe gyant. Arthour fow?t wyþ þat wyght; He had almost ylost hys Myght: Wyþ Muche peyne, þru? godde? grace He sclowh þe Geant in þat place, And þan he made Bedewere To smyte of hys heed þere. To þe Ost he dude hyt brynge, And þeron was gret wondrynge, Hyt was so oryble &amp; so greet, More þan any Horse heed. Than hadde hoel Ioye ynowh For þat Arthour so hym sclowh; And for a perpetuel Memorie He Made a chapell of seynt Marye In þe hulle vpon þe pleyne, Wyþ-Inne þat (:) þe tumbe of Eleyne; And þat name wyþoute nay Hyt bereþ ?ut in-to þis day. Now ys an ende of þis þynge, And artour haþ nyw tydynge: Lucy þe Emperour wyþ hys host Comeþ fast in gret bost; Þey helyþ ouer all þe lond, Fowre hunderd þowsand An hunderd &amp; foure &amp; twenty,— Thus herawdes dude ham rekeny;— Thus he hadde gadered to hym Of cristiens and of Sarasyn, Wyþ all hys wytt &amp; labour To destroyen Arthour. Arthour dude wyselye, And hadde euer gode aspye Of lucyes gouernynge And of hys þyder comynge; But somme seyde hyt were folye To fyght a?enst Emperour lucie, For he hadde sexe euere a?enst oon, &amp; counceyled Arthour to fle &amp; goon. Wyþ þe Emperour come kynges Many oon, And all þeire power hooll &amp; soom; Stronger men My?t no man see, As full of drede as þey myght be; But / Arthour was nat dysmayd, He tryst on god, &amp; was wel payd, And prayd þe hye trynyte Euer hys help forto be; And all hys Men wyþ oo voyse Cryede to god wyþ Oo noyse, “Fader in heuene, þy wyll be doon; Defende þy puple fram þeire foon, And lat nat þe heþon Men Destroye þe puple crystien: Haue Mercy on þy se[r]uantis bonde, And kepe ham fram þe heþon honde; Þe Muchelnesse of Men sainfayle Ys nat victorie in Batayle; But after þe wyll þat in heuene ys, So þe victorie falleþ y-wys.” Than seyd Arthour, “hyt ys so: Auant Baner, &amp; be Goo.” Now frendes all, for goddes loue, Rereþ ?owre hertes to god aboue, And seyeþ ?owre prayeris faste, Þat we well spede furst &amp; laste. Pater noster. The emperour tryst on hys men, And þat haþ bygyled hym; Forsothe hyt most nede? be so, For þey beþ cursed þat well hyt do, Maledictus qui confidet in homine.Such all myght comeþ of god; To tryst on hym, y hold hyt good, Lucye haþ pyght his pauelon And sprad wyþ pryde his gunfanon; His claryons blastes full grete blywe, Archeris schot (:) Men ouer-thrywe; Bowes, arwes, &amp; arblastere Schot sore all y-vere; Quarels, arwes, þey fly smerte; Þe fyched Men þru? heed &amp; herte; Axes, sperys, and gysarmes gret, Clefte Many a prowt Mannes heed: Hors &amp; steedes gan to grent, And deyde wyþ strokis þat þey hente; Many a man þere lost hys lyf, Many on was wedyw þat was wyff; Þere men were wetschoede All of Brayn &amp; of blode; Gret rywth hyt was to seyn Þe feltes full of men y-scleyn; Lucy þe Emperour also was dede; But ho hym sclowh, y can nat rede; He, for all hys grete Renoun, A?enst Arthour hadde no fusoun, No more þan haue twenty schep A?enst vyve wolfe? greet. To god be euere alle honoure?! The falde was hys &amp; Arthoure?. Arthour, as he scholde done, Sende lucyes body to Rome. Whan þe Romeynes say þis, Þo þey dradde Arthour &amp; hys. Also he buryed Bedewere Hys frend and / hys Botyler, And so he dude other Echon In Abbeys of Relygyon Þat were cristien of name; He dude to alle þe same; And dude for ham Masse synge Wyth solempne song &amp; offrynge, And bood þere for to rest Tyll þat wynter was past, Boþe he (.) hys Men echone Seruyd god in deuocione, Þankyng god of hys My?t Þat kepeþ hys seruauntez ry?t, And suffreþ noon for to spylle Þat hym loueþ &amp; tryste wylle: Þus worschup god dude certeyn To Englond, þat þo was Bretayn; Þe More Breteyn Englond ys— As men may rede on Cronyclys— By?end þe See Bretayne þer ys, Þat haþ hys name forsoþe of þis, For þe kyng Maxymyan,— Quomodo anglia est Britannia maior, &amp; quare maior Þe next after Octauyan,— He conquered all Armoryk, And to þe Reme named hyt lyk: Armorica.Amorica on latyn me cleped þat lond, Tyl Maxymyan co[n]queryd hyt wyth honde, And called hyt lyte bretayne þan, So hy?t þis lond þat he coom fram; For perpetuell Mynde of grete Bretayne He called hyt lyte Bretayne, Þat Men schulde kepe in Mynde &amp; wytt How þis lond conqueryd hytt; For Walsch Men beþ Bretouns of kynde— Know þat well fast on Mynde— Englysch men beþ Saxoynes, Þat beþ of Engistes Soones; There-fore þe walsch man Breton Seyþ &amp; clepeþ vs “Sayson” Þat ys to seye vpon a reess, “Stynkyng Saxone, be on pees.” And seyþ (.) “taw or (.) Peyd Sayson brount” Whan he ys wroth (:) or ellys drounke; Hauyng Mynde of Engystis Men Þat wyth gyle sclow þeyre kyn: At þe place of þe Stonehenge ?ut þey þenkeþ for to venge: And þat hyt neuere be so, Seyþ a Pater noster more to. Pater noster. Now turne we to oure labour, And lat vs speke of Arthour: He cast on herte sone After þat to go to Rome, And spak of Passage &amp; hys wey Forth ouer Mont Ioye. And sone after vpon an owr He hurde of Mordred the tretour That hadde all þis lond on warde— Euyll moot such fare, and harde! Who may best bygyle a man But such as he tryst vpan? Þer ys no man wel nye, y tryste, Þat can be waar of hadde wyste.— Mordred, þis falss Man, Much sorw þo bygan; He stuffed alle castells Wyþ armyre &amp; vytells, And strenghthed hym on eche syde Wyth Men of contreys ferre &amp; wyde: He toke þe qweene, Arthoure? wyff, A?enst goddes lawe &amp; gode lyff, And putte heore to soiourne þo At Euerwyk (:) god ?yf hym wo.— Yhork ys Euerwyk (:) &amp; so me calleþ hyt.— Arthour aryved at Whytsond Wyth gret Myght &amp; strong hond, And Mordred sain? fayl ?af hym þo a strong batayl; Many a man, as y rede, Þat day was þere dede; Arthoures nevew Waweyn Þat day was þere y-sclayn, And oþer kny?tes Many moo: Þan Arthour was heuy &amp; woo. Mordred fly toward Londoun; He most nat come in þe toun: Þan fled he to Wynchester And wyth hys Mayn? kep hym þer; And Arthour on gret haste Pursywed after hym faste. Mordred wythoute fayle Fled in-to Cornewayle. The qwene wyþoute lesyng Hurde of þis tydyng, And how Mordred was flow, And how to Cornewale he hym drow. Heo of Mercy hadde noon hoope, Ther-for he dude on a Russet cote, And to Carlyon ys preuyly Ronne, And made heore self þo a Nonne; Fro þat place neuer heo wende, But of heore lyf þere made an ende. Waweynes body, as y reede, And other lordes þat weere deede, Arthour sente in-to skotlonde, And buryed ham þere, y vnderstonde. Muche folke þerhenne he toke þo, Of Northumber-lond also Fram dyverse places to Arthour come Hys wyll to werk &amp; to done: Thus he sembled a full gret Ost; To Cornewayle he draweþ hym fast After þat Mordred þe traytour Þat hadde do hym Much dyshonour. That tretour hadde gret Strength And fulled þat lond on brede &amp; length, Such a batell as þere was redy þo Hadde neuer Arthour byfore y-doo: They fow?t tyl þer come doun bloode Bellum arthuri apud Camelertonum in Cornubia.As a(.) Ryver or (.)a(.) flood; Þey fow?t euer sore &amp; sadde; Men nyst ho þe betere hadde; But at þe last Certeyn Was Mordred &amp; alle hys y-sclayn; And Arthour y-bete wyþ wounde, He Myght not stonde on grounde; But on lyter ry?t anon Auelona .i. insula pomorum Glastonia.Was brow?t to Auelon Þat was a place fayr &amp; Mury; Now hyt hooteþ Glastyngbury. Ther Arthour þat worthy kyng Maked hys lyues endyng; But for he skaped þat batell y-wys, Bretons &amp; Cornysch seyeþ þus, “Þat he leuyth ?ut parde, And schall come &amp; be a kyng a?e.” At glastyngbury on þe qweer Þey made Artoure? toumbe þere, And wrote wyth latyn vers þus, Hic iacet Arthurus, rex quondam, rex que futurus. Thys was þus forsoþe ydone Þe yheer after þe Incarnacione, Anno domini quingentesimo quadragesimo secundo. Vyf hundred (.) fourty &amp; two. Now saue vs alle fra woo Ihesu cryst, heuenly kyng, &amp; graunt vs alle hys blessyng; And þat hyt Moote so be, Seyeþ alle Pater &amp; Aue. Pater noster / Aue / Ho þat woll more loke, Reed on þe frensch boke, And he schall fynde þere Þynges þat y leete here. But yf þat god wolle graunte grace, y schall rehercy in þis place Alle þe kyngez þat after were, And what names at þey bere; And ho þat woll þeyre gestes loke, Reed on þe Frensch boke.
