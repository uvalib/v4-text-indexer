Vnto the Iudgement of the wyse and learned, I Submit my paynes (to pleasure th?) perswaded thorowlye: That with aduisement they will speake, and reason ryght Shall rule theyr tongues. whearfore vnto syr Momus more dyspyte I gyue these same: that he, a whyle maye gnawe theron. To whet his poysoned r?ckling teth, I cast the curre a bone: Lest that hee seeke to byte my name behynde my backe, To saye that here his verse is lame, or here good sence doth lacke. For I ofte times haue heard the vyle despysed sorte Blynd ignorantes, of worthie bokes to make suche rashe reporte: That when in order good, they could not read the same, They doubted not by sla?derous wordes the aucthors to defame. That learned men alowe these same, it shall to me Suffyse. Of Momes I do not seeke commended for to be. Let them that no tyme spare to speake all that they maye To mee: and I will answere them right sone, at eche assaye. Theyr brutishe braynes vnfit to iudge of melodye, Their blinded wittes, &amp; sences stopt do vnto them denie The vse of reason so: that monsters ryght they be, Despised dregges of men, to them in shape alone agree. Or els ryght ???????? and currysh whelpes they weare, Their iudgementes I do now dispise: theyr rage I do not feare. The Argument. [The mercye of God is merueylous] The mercye of God is merueylous: VVhich wh? it pleaseth him to ext?d On men, no wile so mischeuous, Can it peruert from perfect end As in this worthye hystorye, It by a Duchesse maye appeare, VVhich faslye of adulterye Accused, is condemned heare For to be burned in a fyre: As then the custome did requyre: But God, which still defendeth ryght, From deathe hath her delyuered, By prowesse of a Spanishe knyght: VVhom afterward she maryed. The Historie of Iohn Lorde Mandozze. Wh? Enuy blacke doth breed within the boyling brest, When rampynge rage of rancour rules wheare reason it shulde rest: Then will doth beare the swaye, Wheare wyt shuld haue the waye. Syth men of lyke estate, and matches meat in myght, Within one countrey dwellyng, seld agree. Syth that despyte Doothe dwell wyth famous men. Syth wealth doth worke the woe, And plenty placeth pryde oft tymes: It is not straunge that so. (Debate dyd grow betwene) The Mandozzes and eke Tolledoes famylyes: Moste auncyent noble gentlemen, and cheyfest lynes lykewyes In all the prouince theare. By worthy workes, theyr fame Was blowen aboute. All Europe then it dyd resound the same. O noble region Spayne, for frutes that fertyle soyle, And happy with the golden mines for which most men do toyle, O Realme more riche when that these houses did agree. O happy soyles whearein such men borne or brought vp they bee. Of both these famylyes ryght noble Gentlemen There were, but yet the lusty Lord Iohn of Mandossa then Dyd farre excell them all in euery exercyse: Most valiant, most actyue, and ryght polityke lyke wyse. He was beloued muche, of all the c?mons theare: Accepted for hys courtesye, with prynces euery wheare. As Pallas paynted had, his minde with lerned arte: Euen so dame Nature then, in hym, ryght well had wrought her parte. His lymmes were fynely framd, hys ioyntes so strongly knyt, That as the Simphonye alwayes doth please the cares: so it The gasyng eyes of men doth still delyght as muche. No paynter for his portrature, could pycture any suche. The Grekishe paynter myght an hundred graces theare haue seene, which erst in s?dry shapes he found not any wheare. And as hys shape did shew right semelie to the syght, So for his force he was well knowne to be a valiaunt knight. In auncyent hystoryes, his highe renowmed fame, Aduaunced hath vnto the skyes the glorye of his name. By space of forty yeares these famylyes betweene, For sondry causes then dissention great had beene. All stoute of eyther parte, they wolde in no wise beare Wrong vnreuenged longe wherfore small skirmishes there weare Betwene them often times, Alwaies when they might meate With weapons drawne y? one, did vse the other for to greate. But once, with Armyes great they met theyr myght to trye: By dynt of swerd they wold discerne theyr matters by and by, And so, the youthly Lord Mandossa then did beare The rule, &amp; charge as cheiftain stoute of all hys armye theare. Though to Minutyus he might be matched well The Captaines Oration to Souldiers Added by the Translatour.For corage. Yet for counsell did not Fabius hym excell. When that his foes, he vewes, in glistring armour dyght. His soldiers in such sorte he doth encorage then to fyght. Behole my frendes, (sayth he) the tyme approcheth neare. This day, we must by m?hode great, withstand our enmyes heare Our enemyes (sayth hee) how simply they be guyded. How rage rules them, &amp; reason vs, how well we be prouided. Of armour good, and men, though not so many as they Yet such as do not fear, to spend their blood I dare well saye. Now, now, this tyme shall trye, if such as we appeare, We do acquyt our selues lyke men: to fyght with lusty cheare. Who wold not rather chuse, to dye, then liue with shame? As dastardes for to be despisd, to lose the worthy fame, Which with their blood before, our auncestores haue wonne. Shuld we faint hartes not folow th? to do as they begonne? What bondage is so vyle? what yoke so hard to beare As for to stoope vnto the foe and styll to lyue in feare? Our auncestours, with landes, dyd leue vs lybertie. Shuld we enthral our selues therfore for feare and doubt to dye? To beare the blot of blame For euer in our name. Who lookes to lyue so longe in bondage for to bee? Can stomakes stout, of manlike men to seruyle yoke agree? O happy death, that doth exempt from miserye. The noble Romayne Captaines dyd not doubte for fame to dye. Are we not able now, to kepe the worthy fame, that earst by blood was won: shal w?t of courage lose the same? What wolde our frendes say then, and all the men that shall Heare of the shame that shuld by cow wardyse vpon vs fail? No man theron wold pitye take, But euery one wold vs forsake. Our parentes dead, and shut in happy feyl[illeg.]es, they will For sorow sound into our eares, a dreadfull howlyng styll. Theyr sprightes will vs pursue, all men will vs dispise. For wante of manhode we shalbe a gasing for their eyes. The chyldren in the streates, will pointe at you, and saye. Loe there, the wretches which of late by force weare dryuen awaye: From heritages left, to them so longe agoe. By their forefathers olde. And they lyke beastes haue lost it so, No place there shall apeare, from shame to hide vs in. Wherfore at once let vs accompte to dye or els to winne, Be stoute. For if your courage quaile Loe th? furthw? your force doth faile. Tho stayne will neuer out, it styckes vnto the stocke, We must take hede therfore lest that our shyp run on the rocke. The losse of worldly wealthe, which time may soone restore, Is small. But honour beinge loste is gone for euermore. O men as deare to me as fostred chyldren are, Unto their nurce. For wh? my blood nor lyfe I will not spare, Your wealthes is mine. And I With you will lyue and dye. Upon your manhodes now, my state I do repose, And for to winne your wealth, I will not spare my lyfe to lose. Now are you at a poynte to dye or els to lyue, Contented well with such a lot as destnies vs shall gyue. The Souldyers then aloude, all with one voyce do crye. Loe yours we are, thoughe prest we weare a thousand deathes to die. Then streight the trompets sownd the banners be displaid. And thundring captaines voyce doth cheare such men as were afraid. The foming Steades do stampe, halfe mad to heare the sound Of drommes, the blowes on harnesse ring, &amp; men that fall to ground. Mandossa courseth them. with charged staffe in hand. No man could beare his blow so wel, nor yet hys force withstand: But downe to ground he goes, or through his bodie slydes The speare. And so without a foyle no man his stroke abydes, Then with his battell axe, he doth so rudely greete Them at the fyrst, that after, him they had no lyst to meete. His men, to marke that he his life did hazard so. their weried sprightes refresshed are and forewarde they do go. On euery syde, they laye aboute them with such myght: That boyling rage, win their brestes renewes their force to fyght. Then buckling by the eares, the horsemens sheylds haue met, Unto theyr tacle harde they stycke. and fote to fote is set. So valiantly they fought the feilde. And euery one was loth to yeild. The tops of speares then flye about. And swerdes in twaine Do clinke, such co?ter buffes be lent and paied so well againe. Such noyse with horses, which about the feild doe flinge, Their maisters being slaine before the feild it doth so ringe, With dreadfull sound, as though, into the burning flames Of Aetna mount: flud Euphrates had throwne his downward strames. But to the purpose now. Iohn of Mandozze had. A sister, sure a lady good, which for these thinges was sad. And then vppon her knees within her chamber fell, And prayd to God contynuallye that it myght please him well To reconsile and make these familyes agre, That to theyr furyous attemptes a better ende myght bee. In mydst of all the fyght, when slayne on euery syde A nomber weare. And doubtfull still the conquest dyd abyde: She vowes. If vyctorie her brother may obtayne. To Rome she will a voyage goe and come a fote againe. So after cruell fyght, (it chaunced thus that daye. The Lord Mandossa conqueroure, doth bringe the spoyles awaye. Tolledes theyr force dyd faile theyr blood abrode is spyld, And driu? to take their legges, furthwith they do forsake the feild. The ladye Isabell, hereof doth vnderstand, And she her vowe declareth to, her brother out of hand. Which at the fyrst doth muse, how she durst vndertake On foote for his behoofe, so long a voyage for to make. And loth he is that shee, should then aduenture so: Through landes vnknowne, so perylous a iourney for to go. But shee vnportunate her vowe for to fulfill: Doth craue so much that he c?sents, to gyue her his good will, Uppon this charge that well, prouided therunto Of furniture: With ease she should, by litle iourneys goe. She takes her leaue of him. he wills her well to fare, And as his comforte so her health, he biddeth her to care Departed then from Spayne, on Pirenees anon She mo?tes. Those hils being left behynd, through Fraunce when she is gon, And past the vtmost parte. therof. As shee on hie Beholdes the haughty Alpes hytis, that reacht vnto the skye. As she possessed had the hyghest of them all: Dispisyng then the cloudes benethe and Cities seming small, At last with dowenward eyes. Right goodly she espies, The Cytie Thurin fayre, that noble famous towne: The duke of Sauoy his ancient seate whose wyfe had such renowne, For bewtyes louely grace: that euery wheare her fame With worthy praise, had blown about the glory of her name. For as to Helen, shee was matche for goodly grace: Euen so her fame renoumed was as much in euery place. Dame Nature tried in her the force of all her art, I wrought by w?drous worke, of her appeared euerie part. This Duches, syster was vnto the puissant kynge Of happy Ile, in Occean wyde, whose sacred soyle doth bringe In feild such valiunt men, and doth with plenty greate, Increase al things, which may for th? in any wise be meate. Deuided from the worlde, a world alone it is: Which of it selfe sufficientlye hath all comodyties. Norward, not farre beyond the noble countrey France. And Troian Brute his land it was which stories olde aduance. The spanish ladie now, to Thurin glad doth goe, To trie if fame the trueth hath tolde. and then, it chaunced so By fortunes fauour fayre, that as she entred had Into the Cytie, she espies the Duchesse fayre, Iclad With purple syne, whose glosse doth glyster in her eyes. As do the beames of Titans sonne from hyghest of the skies, So that she doubteth styll, whether she should beholde The ladye bright with beuties shine, or her attyre with gould So gorgeous and braue. both do lykewyse delyght: But yet the beames of beauty fayre shyne clearer in her syght. In Horselitter the Du- chesse borne with Horses fayre, Unto the feildes it pleaseth her to ryde to take the ayre. The Ladye Isabell, when she perceiued that, With fixed eyes beholding her as one that wondred at Some sight that seemed straunge: she standeth still in staye. The longer that she lookes, the more she likes in her alwaye. In mynde she doth commend, the shape of her alone. She surely thinkes, she neuer earst did see so fayre a one. She knowes her beautie now, agreing to her fame. And what she knows she c? not chuse but needs must shewe the same. The passing beauty, whiche in her aboue all other She vewes: makes her a matche to make the better for her brother. Whom much more deare then lyfe (good Lady) she did loue. And therfore to her companie, (affection so did moue) In Spanish tongue she speakes aloud. If God (saith shee) Wold grant, my brother might vnto this Duchesse maried be: Then might I well be bould, (and trueth therin) to saye, They were y? goodliest couple sure, in Europe at this daye. The Duchesse, which right well did vnderstand the tonge, Still passing forth, she marketh well the company alonge, All theare as they did stand: fayning as though that then, She did not vnderstand the speeche, nor knew what she did meane. But in her minde she thought, as she did seme to be, Some noble woman. And therfore she biddes a Page, go see Where shee will go to lodge: and shewe her, how that I Desire her for to go and see my Castell by and by. But as the Duchesse doth walke by the riuers syde: Wher siluer streams twixt medowes greene, w? silent noyse do slyde. She museth styll vpon the wordes whych she before Had herd. And then into her mynd it runneth euermore. So tost in troubled minde she homeward hies in hast, To talke with Lady Isabell. and so she comes at laste With quicke returde agayne vnto her Castell, wheare She fyndes the Ladye Isabell, which taryed for her theare. And so due reuerence shee doth without delaye, Unto the noble Duchesse, as her better euery waye. And she ryght courteouslie Lykewyse doth entertaine The stranger well: perceiuinge sone that she came furthe of Spayne. She of her fortune, and her name enquyres also. She asketh eke the cause wherfore thys voyage she doth go. When that the Duchesse knew her byrth to be so great, She dothe excuse her selfe forthwith, that she with honour meate Had not receyued her, and putteth all the blame, On ignoraunce of her estate and place from whence she came, Then after much good talke of other matters so, The noble Duchesse at the last desyreth for to kno Wherto the wordes earst of her beauty there she spake. And wherfore w? her brothers shape she first that matche did make, The shamefast Spaniard sayth, (with blusshyng at the same:) Wh? that I sawe your beuty bright agreinge to your fame, I was so bolde, furthwith in Spanysh speache to prayse My brother: though he might haue b? commended more alwayes By mouth of other, for because that I may seme, As syster some what parciallie his beautie to esteme. Yet notwithstanding that I do not doubt to saye, (As they that know hym can report) in Spaine this many a day, There was not liuinge seene A worthyer gentleman, But as to prayse, your beauties. If I haue offended than Pardon I craue, because I spake vnfaynedly The same, with but agaynst y? troth I could not yet denye, Wherfore the Duchesse fayre lest shee shuld faile to doe; Her diligence, to further it shee aunsweres ther vnto, Madame, thoughe yet [illeg.] you thus [illeg.] I doubt not but by chaunge of place your iudgement so it will Be altered, For sure I rather thanke that you, In mynd your brothers beutie haue, so well imprinted now, That euerie shape, whiche is presented to your eyes: You measure to the perfect tipe, and fourme of him likewise, Madame, the Spainard saide if I haue done amisse, To make comparyson vnmeate: yet beare with me for this. Though it maye not became his syster for to saie, So muche, as truth of him might tell yet sure thus muche, ye maye Heare of his enemyes, whiche ye beyond his grace, Wyll saye he is the gentlest knyght, that lyues in anye place. The Duchesse, seyng her so earnest for to be, To prayse her brother. Therwithall delyghted much is shee, And so shee brynges her in, and calles for supper sone, Which beyng serued sumpteously when all the cheare was done, To honour her the more, her wyll is so, that shee Shall in her chamber with her selfe that nyght well lodged be. Wher as the pylgram then, being wearye of her waye Toke rest, and soundlye sleped styll but styll the Duchesse laye, With warres within her head: as they that lyue in loue, Nothing y? Spanyshe lord vnknown myght from her mynd remoue. She doth suppose, her selfe this semely shape to see, And well she lykes the fancye, which doth shew him such to bee. She doth c?mend his louely face: And lyketh well hys goodly grace. In loue she wotes not how, Such force hath Cupide blynd, A stranger she in darkenes doth beholde within her mynd. Supposyng semely shapes somtyme so to agree: That soone she saith (vnto her selfe) euen such a one is hee: And fayrer then the same, if any fayrer be. But at the last, of hym such one she doth suppose: That such a frend, she could right wil contented be to chose. In mynde, she doth compare him, to the goodlyest knyght, That euer she had seene before, so fancye feades her syght. That nyght she toke no rest, but turninge to and fro, On euery syde, vnquietly: the night she spendeth so. Eche beuty of the knyght, conceyued in her hart, Lyke poyson vile, increaseth flames infecting euery part. The daye, at last alofte lyftes vp the lampe of lyght. And Pheabus fayre vpon the earthe doth cast his beames so bryght. Then Ladye Isabell, prouided to depart: Doth of the Duchesse take her leaue, which feleth at her hart Such feruent flames of fyre, such grypyng greifes, that then, She wissheth, that she neuer had the Spanysh Lady seene. For syth she hath begonne: Her worke must nedes be done. She can not rule her rage, her race begonne to stay, Her fury doth enforce her furthe for to kepe on her waye. And so she could not rest, vntill the Spanyard, she Had promysed at her returne, with her againe to be, Then wisshing her good spede, to God she leaues her so. And whylest the Ladye Isabell, furth on her waye doth goe: The Duchesse styll doth seeke, the meane, wherbye she maye Suppresse her flames, &amp; quenche the fire: her furye for to staye. But styll the more shee stryues, more feruent is the fyre. And as the greater hope remaynes: the more is her desyre, Within her tender brest, suche force is of the flame: That shee, good Duchesse, could not longe endure to beare the same. Her heauye harte so sore opprest Did spoile her lymes of wonted rest. So. After sundrye swarmes, of thoughtes on euerie syde: Upon the part of loue then dothe the vyctorye abyde, It is at such a poynt, without the better chaunce, The Duke her husb?d (cuckold) may, Unto the bornepype daunce. And thus, at last shee doth determyne for to take Aduise her in: and Emblyn then, her mayden for to make, Of counsell ther vnto: whom shee did know of ould, So trust ye, that she doubted not these secreates to vnfould, To her, when she fyt time doth fyne, She thus begins to breake her mind. O Emilie, (sayth she) it is well knowen to you: If you haue fasten heede vnto, My fashions are now, Euen synce that fyrst, I did From England came my waye, Unto thafflycted myndes, I was a refuge and a staye. But destenies, they, now such lot to me do gyue: That I of councell neade as much, as any one alyue Sith worthye I haue none, my mynd to vnderstand But you: in you alone my fyrste, and latest helpe doth stand. This cause it doth import no lesser thynge then this, Whearon both lyfe, &amp; honour lyeth of suche a weyght it is. And therfore this may tell, That I dare trust you well. She shewes furthwith, that she was not in quyet sence, The Spanysh Ladye Isabell departed had from thence. And so declares, that with her brothers worthy prayse My harte is wonne: so that within my minde, his vertue staies. And I can take no rest, My wytes, on him alwaies Be occupyed. Yet one myght muse how it should be. But I shall neuer liue in rest: tyll I that Lord may see. Thys sayd, she doth conclude, that for no wanton will: But for to vewe such semely shape, therfore she longeth styll. Then Emblin, which did loue euen with her hart alwayes The Duchesse, Piteing her cause, with gentle wordes she prayes Her for to staye a whyle, and to resyst her gryfe: And she within two dayes at most for her will fynd relyfe. The Duchesse glad therof, requires her earnestly To thynke theron, and promiseth if good effect therby Do come: to no vnthankfull one She shuld perceiue that plesure done And so, when Emblin had approued many wayes. Therfore. Unto the Duchesse, she doth come within two daies, And telleth her: that, if thys meane may like her minde, She neade not further seke, therfore a fitter shyft to fynd. And if that you wyll do this same: Your enterprise of force must frame. If you, furthwith will fayne your selfe so sycke to be: That euerye one more hope of death then lyfe in you maye see, In midst of all the sycknes, you Ryght solemnlye may make a vowe: That if you may furthwith, recouer health againe, Within a certayne time to goe a voiage into Spaine, Unto saynt Iames his shryne. and frelye forward so, With Ladye Isabell at her retourne: you may well goe. And then you may behould, as longe as you shall please The knyght which now hath ben the cause of this your great vnease But we alone shall haue to much adde, I feare, So fynelye in the brauest sort to bringe about this geare Wherfore if you thynke good to ioyne the thyrde heareto, One man I may commaund for me all that he can to doe, And this is maister Appian. Your graces owne Phisician. Herein I may be bould to tell the truth to you, He hath sought many sundry meanes to winne my loue ere now, He hath bene vexed sore, longe tyme for loue of me: And that in waye of honestie, (as farre as I could see) Of whom tyll now, I haue accounted very small For hetherto he hath receaued almost no hope at all, But if wyth flattryng eyes, and chearfull lookes, I shall Make much of hym, and sumtyme for to kysse him ther wyth all: I knowe his loue is suche, he would not sticke for me, To make an hasard of his lyfe, if such a neade shuld be. He is a wytty man, and trimlye learnd also, Estemed muche abroade, and maye, do much heare in I kno. The Duchesse, streyght as she, doth vnderstand of this Discourse: the polycye vnto her mynd so fytt it is, That ouer come with ioye, the mayd she did embrace. And said good w?ch hereby, thou hast hyghe and lost ye place In my good will, and so, you shall haue euermore. By fayth of me a Pryncesse I do promyse you therfore, If that my purpose, now take happilye successe, I will no longer vse you as an handmayden doubtlesse, But I do rather mean, a frend of you to make. Of wh? in doubtfull thinges alwaies some comfort I may take. For I assure my selfe, as you haue shewed here in Your gredie will, so may you styll proceade as you begin, And as a strong and stedfast staie I shall accounte of yon alwaye. Now am I satisfied, by that: which you haue sayde, So well, that I of any thinge nead not to be afraide, If fortune on our syde may be. Now go thy waye, To talke with thy Physician, and I without delay, Wyll lay me downe to rest, and fayne disease, so well That none may it perceiue, now gon is Emblyn, for to tell How that the Duchesse is, diseased in her head: And lately is layd downe to take sume rest vppon her bedd, The Duchesse doth deuyse to haue a further payne. Within her stomake sone she learnd, such sycknes for to fayne. She tourneth often tymes about, to seke her ease, And though she fayne it finelie: yet shee feleth no disease. She plunged is in paine poore soule, for pleasures sake: She meanes by greif so much to gain as shall her sorowes slake. Such [illeg.] haue women. Loe such shyftes how they can make When that they list full pretilye theyr pleasures for to take, So sycke as she appeares, so hole is deade she is, She semes so sad, and in so glad, that none perceaueth this. No one suspicious parte, for to declare her mynde, In all the tyme of that desease, in her they could not fynde. Full foure dayes thus she laye, and semd to take no rest: Although that with no painful greife She felt her selfe opprest. Yet lookynge like to die, the liuelye ladye lyes, Nor hope of health in her at all that anye one espies. Eche one bewayles her woe, and sorowes for her greyfe: Her selfe alone a refuge knowes in sycknes to releife Her hart. O colour fyne, O craft ye cloked ioye. Her sorowes such, her ease so much such pleasaunt sweete [illeg.], Well worth such witts, as [illeg.], the way for to deuyse A remedye for to recure theyr carefull miseryes, Well worth the ready braines that euer haue in store A shyft at nead, within a Bore beare salue for euerye sore. So symple as shee seeme, so subtle as she is: It is a wonder for to see them so deceaud in this. No man alyue could more, dissemble in such case, Her wordes so fytlie framd therfore, that sure had the grace For to be sycke, but now hath Emblin begonne To talke with maister Appian, and thus at last hath donne So much: that shee hath sett him into louers trace And then w? long discourse forthwith she shewes the Duchesse case? What furyous fyttes shee felt, what panges she did abyde: Tyll that this remedie, for her at last shee did prouide. And [illeg.] conclude, she addeth this therto: That if he kepe her counsell close endeuouryng to doe, His best to ayde her, then she promyseth streight waie, To be his wyfe. To wittnesse which, she makes no more delaye, But with her foulded armes his necke she did imbrace, And kyssed him ryght louinglye, But Appian glade of grace, Can skant such ioye sustaine, thearwith more glad was he, Then if that his Hipocrates, or Galen he should see From out theyr restfull graues, for to haue rysen then, To lead theyr lyues, as they had done amonge the mydst of men. He promysed, her then in nothinge to denie, While he should lyue, &amp; so thearon vp go they by and by, Unto the Duchesse then theyr purpose to begyn. And to her chamber so when they weare entred in, He maie perceiue how shee doth hardlye drawe her winde, And for the suffocation of her matryce, he doth fynde Furthwyth, that she would haue a stomoke very weake. With dobled tongue w? in her mouth full fayntlye she could speake, He doth to them declare, what daunger she is in: With manie protestations his tale he doth begine, Fyrst biddinge euerie one to drawe them selues asyde, Whylst he by further talke may tell, how she her selfe shall guide, And so furth with they goe awaye, And leaue hym there his mind to say. Now that all these afayres the better he myght hyde, With him an od perfume he brought the force wherof was tryed To be so strange, that by the smell thearof, strayght waye The Duchesse in such fyttes lyke one halfe dead, long tyme shee laye, Tyll force thearof were gone, and then to her agayne, The [illeg.], and wonted hue, it did fourthwith remaine. The Duchesse, lyked that so well: that in her minde She thought all men cold not, for her a fytter medcine fynd. Amonge them three, then is the matter handled so: That through y? town y? comen brute From mouthes of men doth go: The Duchesse neades wyll dye. the Duke doth vnderstand Heareof, and sent for all the best Phisicians out of hand That were in Thurin then: to this entent that they Shuld looke to her, which being cum Unto the Duke, strayght waye Unto her chamber vp, they all together goe The Duke with them desires to here how that his wife maye doe, Whose colour in her face was altered so much: That shee appeared then as thoughe, shee neuer had bene suche. And they which her before had seene, Might doubt if she the same had bene. For why, of Appian [illeg.] she tooke perfume before: That of her health Phisycians, Despayred euer more. And so when all they had consulted what they could With maister Appian they doubt what waye thearin they should Take. And at last they come the Duke vnto, and saie Twere best, y? for her soule he should prouyde the best he maye. The Duke beyond all mesure, aflycted then with greife: Sendes for the byshopps suffragane a man of Godlye life, That he should her exhort stedfast in fayth to be. And of this father olde, furthwith confessed then is she, With voyce so faint (God knowes) Her wordes were vttered As though not of this world she were she seemed then halfe dead. Her piteous ruthfull lookes, perswaded euerye one, That from her senceles corps furthewith the lyfe [illeg.] be gone. Yet thankes be vnto God, a faythfull soule was she: She hopes, ere it be longe, in shrift with spanishe Lord to be. The Bishop in few wordes, with her had quycklye done: Her nature faylynge sure he thought that death was comminge on. The Duchesse gyues him thankes: desyrynge that he will Amonge his daylye orisons. her soule remember still, Then streyght the lustye Lordes and Ladyes do cum in: One doth be wayle her wofull case. an other doth begin, To gyue her counsell that to dye she maye prouide, And lykneth men vnto the flower, that can not long abyde. The Duchesse then begyns, in frantike furyous fitts, To beate her selfe, and taketh on as shee had lost her wytts. Amased thear with all, as manye as are by Do thinke, how y? her life will leaue her corps imediatlye One wyse amonge the rest, Alowd to her doth crye: O souerayne thinke on christ y? which on crosse for vs did dye. Another willeth her, on other sayntes to call: The noyse is great, but Emilie which knowes her counsells all. Saynt Iame (sayth she) from youthe, you shorshypped alwaies. To heare of him the duchesse streight as in a traunce shee stayes, She rules with vylage wan, her deadlye downward eyes. And tremblyng verye fynelye, then with holow voyce shee cryes. O gloryous Apostle, whych me dydst helpe alwaye: If by thy intercession, my health this tyme I maye Recouer well, to thee due honour for to doe Unto the place, whearas thy corps is buryed wyll I goe. When fayned prayers she, had ended in this wyse, To trie if shee can sleape a whyle, she shut her heauye eyes, And [illeg.] quyet rest, she dyd contynew so: Then euerye one therfore furth of her chamber straight doth go, Exept the Duke alone, which could not go awaye: But for his louyng spouse her health, to God on hyghe doth praie. Two howres then beyng past, the Duchesse in her bed, Doth stirre more liuelie then before: and holdeth vp her head, That one myght see she was well eased of her payne. With strength she casteth furthe her armes. &amp; plucks them in again. The Duke her husbande then, with liuely chearfull eye: With heauie hue leninge besyde, her head, she doth espye. And then about his necke, her heedles armes doth caste: And kyssing him she sayd, good Lord, three howres not fully past, I thought I should haue left, these ioyes and all with you, But thankes to God, &amp; eke the saynt to whom I made my vow, I fele my selfe, so well [illeg.] amended for to be, That if I ware not worse agayne, I dare well warrant thee, You shall not yet awhyle be maryed anye more. But wh? y? Duke did heare the same he was so glad therfore: That then he had no power to speake one word at all, But marueylynge doth her behould as one that had a fall Downe from on hyghe, and styll lyes gasyng on the ground, Not knowing wheare he is, lyke one that falleth in a sound, This past, as sone as of these newes the people knoe, Reioysing, that the Duchesse fayre was then amended so, In theyr processions to God great thankes they gyue, As was their w?t. For wel they hope the Duchesse now will lyue. Eche one did wayle her woe, and of her health to heare Eche one was glad, within the court theare [illeg.] was the cheare They now begin to styrre, whyche earst did sit still sad. The Duchesse was so well beloued that euery one was glad To heare the newes and so, the Duchesse takes suche heade. That she recouered before shee felt dysease in deade, Then in her hart began anoter kynd of playe. That same dysease she could not help by anye kynde of waye, For Lord Mandozze then, that fytt continewed so: Untyll the Ladye Isabell homeward returned fro Her voyage, and forthwith vnto the Duchesse came: For that at her departinge thence, she promysed the same. So when with other talke, the Duchesse fayre, and shee Protested had, how thone was glad the other for to see. To tell her then at last, the Duchesse doth not staye, How that sore sycke she kept her hed styll sence shee went awaye Fro thence. Nor then shee doth forget, to tell her how, By grace of God &amp; good Saint Iames, to whom shee made her vow: Her health thearby she hathe recouered aganye. If of the Duke her husband then such leaue she may obtaine. She should be hapye sure, her vayage for to goe In her good companye, the Sapnyshe ladye so Perswardes her for to doe, and further doth declare, The synguler momodyties which in her contreie are. How worthy gentle man and Ladyes fayre and free, At her Aryuall theare furthwith will cum her grace to see: All readie for to dee, best seruyce that they can, And so your companye sayth she: shalbe much honour then To me, in pleasant waye how merye we maye be. For to perswade her willyng mynd [illeg.] she, It [illeg.] not to byd hym go, that runnes awaye, It neadeth not by force to dryue the horse that wold not staye. Few wordes maye soone perswade the iudge that is content: Euen of his owne accorde vnto, the case for to consent. The Ladye Isabell, perswadeth her to go, And she had of longe tyme, before be willyng therunto. The Duchesse then dyd thynke eche taryaunce longe alwaye, And therfore to the Duke, her husband on a daye She sayth My Lord I thynke ye knowe the greuous payne, And martyrdome which I so longe in sycknes dyd sustayne. The vow also, I trowe you haue not yet forgott. Which for my health recouered, I gladlye made, God wott, And therfore me suche leue, I pray you for to geue: That out of hand I [illeg.] dispache this voyage [illeg.] Hauynge occasyon fytt by thys great Ladye as ye know. She wolde be glad I thynke, that we myght go to gether. And it myght be both for myne ease and honour to go with her, Thearto, the gentle Duke ryght gladly dyd agree, The treason, lodged long with in her brest he coulde not see. Prouisyon beyng made for thinges, that they maye neade, Lyke Pilgremes then I clothed, on theyr Iourney they proceade, With manie Ladies fayre, and lustie gentlemen, Syr Appian and Emelye were not forgotten then, Amonge the rest, so much by trauayles great they do: That past the frosen Alpes hyghe they cummen are into The cuntreye of Roswillon, and entred in to Spayne: The Duchesse seinge y? place so nigh wherof she was so sayne, She prayese the Ladye Isabell That by the waye she wold not tell [illeg.] she would be. And so, in lytle iourneys they Arryue, wheare as the lustie Lord, Iohn yf Mandozze laye. The Spanyshe Ladye prayes the Duchesse then, that she Maye sende to shew her brother that arryued theare they be. The Duchesse is content, the messenger is gon, And found the Lord Mandozze sone, to whom he shewes anon. How that the Duchesse is euen now, arryued theare. And tels y? questions: which betwene her, and his syster weare: And passynge beutye of the Duchesse doth declare. Mandozze then right gladly doth hym selfe furthwith prepare, With fortie or fyftie of his worthyest gentlemen, Ryght brauelye so appointed to receaue the Duchesse then, And in his mynde he thought, no Pryncesse was so free Or careles of her labour, in that age and tyme; [illeg.] A foote woulde vndertake So great a voyage for to make. But for sume other cause. but what therof he maye Conceaue, in mind right well he doth dissemble that alwaye, So on he rydes, tyll that his syster doth espye, Him from a farre in fyeldes, and so she sheweth by and by Unto the Duchesse how, he which c?mes rydynge heare Uppon a Genet whyte as snowe: that is her brother deare. The rest his subiectes are, Mandozze comming nighe, Thryse or foure times at least, he makes his horse to mount on high, And leape into the ayre, with slynging feete aloft. Or this syde turninge thrise about on thother syde as oft, His foote on ground being set with comlie grace streightwaye, When he had kyste the duchesse hand Madame, then dyd he saye. I thinke the wandring knightes that lyued longe agoe, And sought to wyn immortall fame by valiaunt actes also, If they had found suche hap, admonge auentures great, That w? suche worthie Pylgremes so they might somtime haue met: Theyr Speare and Harnes they would soone haue layed syde To beare your burdens in the waye, your trauaill to a byde. And then the Pryncesse, which was well brought vp alwaye, And lyued had in ease, and ioye vntill that present daie, Lest she for shamfast feare, should fayle agayne to giue Aunswere to him (My Lord) she saith if knightes which erst dyd liue Such as you saie they should by greater blysse, haue mett. With Pilgrimes such as we apeare: we must neades hope, that yet. The blessed saynt to whom I made so solemne vow: To honour whom I vndertake this tedyous trauayle now, Wold saue vs from the[illeg.] force or els we should sustayne These laboures great, in iourney long, at last to lese our paine And so, this fyrst attaynt a waye to loue dyd make More wide. Th? Lord Mandozze sone her by the arme doth take: And to his castell leades her furthe, with softlye pace, Denysyng talke not tedious to her in anye case He leades the Duchesse fayre, Cupido blynd dothe leade Them both. As they stil on their way with tender feete doth tread, The one, the other dothe behoulde with fyxed eyes: And both theyr hartes lyke loue doth hold in frendlie hand likewise. The poyson left behind from loue, his leaden dart. She sawe all beuties set in him before her eyes, More perfect portrature, she thought no paynter could deuyse. Though fancie partlye dye perswade her thearunts, She was not much deceaud, for why the Italian storyes do [illeg.] his worthye shape, and further shew of hym, How he did passe the Princes all, which lyued in his tyme. But when the Duchesse had by outward gestures toulde The secretes of her hart oft tymes: and comfort neuer could Receaue, to satesfie her vncontented mynde: And blamyng much within her hart the knyght to be vnkynd, Syth for her trauyle, shee no better hyre could fynde, When at his castell shee three dayes had taryed so: Therfore she doth determyne thence next mornyng for to goe. She meanes to gyue the flypp so to deceaue the knyght. And when Aurora had remoued the darksum shades of nyght When lyght of daunyng daye, Had driuen y? goulden starres away. The Duchesse goes vnto the chaumber by and by, Whearas the Ladie Isabell within her bed did lye. So takynge leaue of her, she thankes her hartelye Both for her entertainement theare and all her courtesye, The Duchesse now she is departed with her trayne, Mandozze vnder standes theareof within and houre or twayne. He looketh then about, and sorye in his hart, He museth much whearfore she shuld so sudaynlye depart, And take no leaue of him. so troubled muche in minde, Am?g a thousand thinges he thinkes it harde the cause to fynde, And thus so longe at last he maruayleth theare at, That his vnthankfullnes he knowes te be the cause of that. Upon him selfe be sees the blame And is right sory for the same. Sith she a Pryncesse great, dyd cum so farre to see Hym th? he cold not chuse but thinke him selfe vnkinde to be, For that to please her then he was no redyer. Nor yet his seruice franke and free had neuer offred her, Whearfore he takes with him two of his men streyght waie. And after her rydes furthe in all the haste he maye, At last vpon a Caulswaye, he Espyes them in theyr waye to be. A lyghted from his horse he makes no more delaye, But asketh of the Duchesse why she went so sone a waye, If at his castell then she was dyspleased so. That of her goynge thence she would not suffer him to knoe, He promiseth with all his seruice true to doe: If it maye please her so. He will with her to Thurin goe. He wyll not her forsake for all the world besyde: If that she will comaund him so with her to go or ride. And passing further he in syghing sore doth saie: O Ladie Duchesse, fortune had done much for me that daie, If when my syster made the vow that she would goe To Rome: I had of enemyes furthwith bene conquerd thoe. For then I myght haue had, some hope agayn to bee A conquerour on them lykewise, and somtyme to be free. But now vnto my selfe subdued: I must remayne A subiect euermore, exept by you I get againe Lost lybertye at last. in you to saue or spyll My life it lyeth. I haue no force for to subdue my wyll. Vnto your grace my selfe I yeld on me your lyste full fyll, You are the cause of all my care. you may recure mine ill. For now (Ahlas,) synce you this contrey fyrst came in: I felt such hard assault within my hart for to begin, That left me to resyst, I haue no further might. And vanquished it boteth not [illeg.] man to fyght, I wot not what to doe, but to complayne my greif, (For to bewaile my woes) to you which maye my mynd releife, And euer that which I so hardlye could sustaine: You would dessemble it, as though you dyd not know my paine. Oft tymes by sygnes, I did to you declare my mynde, And you so straunge therto alwaies my meaninge would not fynd. Far fr? my thoughtes you semd to be My woeful sighes you would not see. And that the soner, so my lyfe myght make an end You left my house also to daie, disdayninge for to spend So lytle tyme, as for to bid me well to fare. And that doth greue my hart agayne, renewynge all my care, So, these maye you desyre For to retourne with me: And shewe me further courtesye, or els that you maye see. On mee, whyche you would more vpon your foes requyre. For cruell death, of this your [illeg.]yght shall paye the woefull hyre, And mournefull syghes, he drawes from depest of hys brest: To tessifye the passions whearwith he was opprest, And gentle teares from out his eyes do fall a pace, The lyuelye blood with collour fresh dyd chaunge within his face. So that he thought his soule with greife opprest so sore: Wold th? haue left his senceles corps, the Duchesse now therfore, Thoughe shamfast blood with in her blushing cheakes: do stay her tunge. her tale for to begyne: The blood as red as rose within her face so cleare, (O beuties force) it did present, a passyng louelye cheare. With modestie deuine, she rules her twyncklyng eyes, And smokynge sighes ful sweete also she castes vp to the skyes, The crystall teares do fall: From downe her face with all. When reason had at last, the woefull hand vndon, Wh[illeg.] staied her tung with Angells voice to speake she thus begon. I do not know the cause, whearfore you do pretend, That I should gyue occasyon, your youthfull dayes to end. For if I knew my selfe but cause of your anoy: My lothed life, I could for greyfe no longer tyme enioye. Such care I Sould conceaue therby: That I should muche desire to dye, Assure your selfe therfore that I would be your owne, For all the world I would not this to anie heare were knowne Th? fainting feare quight fled awaie She doubteth not furthwith to saye. That flamynge fyre of loue (Is kentled in her brest) And she with how by nyght, or day, for him she takes no rest, If you one howre should fele, such fyttes as I sustayne: You myhht saith she, of crueltye then with a cause complaine. For sure your absence is a verye death to mee, And long (I know) I could not liue without sum hope to see You sone. Againe for this to you I will confesse: Long time ere now, I haue for you endured in destresse. It is vnpossyble almost that I shuld lyue: If fortune vnto me furthwith sum comfort do not gyue. But this I must needes saie: that when at fyrst, I sawe Your colde affection and desire, such faynting force to drawe Me to your mynd: I thought the cause therof shuld be, For sum oppinion ill, which you conceyued had of me, Or that perchaunce, you thought (for sure it maye be so) That I should seeme to lyberall, myne honour to forgoe. And that my countrey soyle, I did therfore forsake That of my selfe, a slaue I should to your good graces make. And [illeg.]lie for this cause I tooke no leaue yf you: Wh?fr? your house I came, but yet perceiuing playnlie, now By this your heauie cheare, that other wise I maye Suppose therof: I do confesse my fault. And you I praye For to forget it and at my returne, I shall Sufficient satisfaction paye, and make amendes for all I will repent in place, wheare as I haue offended. And prysoner my hart with you till all this be amended I leaue. And thus the whilst contented you must be, And to your castell now retourne, no further go with me. The knyhht therto obayes, her mynd for to fulfill: But yet her beauties all within his hart imprynted styll He beares, a burden hoate, with loue beynge sore opprest, And hope prolonges his life, which he doth leade in great vnrest, Eche one the others hart doth hould. And so lykewyse The gestures of the one are styll before the others eyes. Now him we leaue, by hope his fancyes for to feade, And to the Duchesse now, which on her voyage doth procead, For fortune lyeth in watche and doth her nettes prepare, She spoyles them of their pleasures sone &amp; turnes theyr ioye to care. So fortunes whele doth run, and roull on euerye syde, Still turneth fortune to and fro she neuer doth abyde Longe tyme in sure &amp; stedfast staye But shyftes her fycle feete alwaye. When that with fayrest face, she semeth for to smyle, Then with Sirenes songe so sweete she seketh to beguyle, Whearfore all wyse men wyll in wether fayre alwaye Prouide their neadfull thinges agaynst a stormy lowryng daye To wyse men nothing cummes, vnlooked for before For all mishaps, the manlike mynd is armed euermore. This Duchesse led her lyfe tyll nowe in blessed ioye, And sone, together darksum cloudes do cum to her anoye. She is preuented now, Mandozze hopes in vayne, For fortune brekes the band, furthw? of all theyr blisse intwaine, She lowres on them on whom erst frendlye she did smlye. Theyr greedye mynde of pleasures swete she doth furthw? beguile. Not twelue dayes after that, the lyuelye Duchesse, she From Thurin did depart, the Duke her husbane gan to be Anoyed with absence longe of her, whom he ryght deare Did hould for feruent loue, which he did euer to her beare, And then consydering well, that she was syster to A kynge and how that her he left, so longe awaie to goe: Perceiuing this, that it vpon her honour laye: He maketh althinges meate, to be prouided for his waye. And well accompanyed with store of gentlemen, Without delaie he laketh shyp, and into Galye then. The sailes be full with wind, through surgyng seas amaine They skoure away, y? hillike waues deuided so in twayne, The wynd doth serue so well vnto his will, that he Ariued at saynt Iames his towne, before the Duchesse she Was cum. But so at last he vnderstandes among The Pilgremes theare, y? it belyke, would not be verie longe, Before shee came, for they had left her then behinde: By litle iourne is comming forth, whearfore ryght glad in mynd, The Duke furthwith doth send sum of his gentlemen, In hast to ride, and met with her, so for to shew her then The commynge of the Duke. which when the Duchesse had Ben tould by th?, she made as though thearof she had bene glad, But sure she could haue bene contented well: that he Shuld not haue taken halfe y? paines to cum so farre to see, In trauaile tedious how well as shee had fared His companie a while (God wots) ryght well she might haue spared. Thouhh then her fancye led. her lust for to fullfyll. Yet doth her reason teach her more to esteme her honour styll, And therfore fynelye, she doth fayne alwayes to be Desyrous with great diligence her husband for to see, S? cheare to h? she nedes must make Thoughe it be but for fashions sake. So she to him furthwith, with fayned speede doth goe, And louelie lookes for him right fine, she shaped had also, Then after greting sweete she pytieth his paine, That he in danger great for her such trauaile shuld sustayne, And sorye in her minde, (she sayth) she is, therfore, But for Mandozze lustye knyght, it greued her the more. And so, in to the churche together they be gon: Whearas her praiers ended fyrst, the Duchesse doth anon Remember in her minde her loues so lewdlye past And winnes so much of wyll that she repentyng, knowes at last That God was much against her enterpryses styll: That shee the Duke vnfaithfullye deceyued: should fulfill Her lust. And sorow so, doth synke within her brest, That then within her heauye hart furthwith she doth protest, To flye her fylthy flame and fufther to forgett, Manduzze his graces all. And muche she thanketh God, that yet Her lust beyonde the bondes of honour hath not gon, And cleane to quenche her lothesome loue she doth agree theron, That so she wyll departe from thence, euen out of hand, Nor of this newes now will she let Mandozze vnderstand, She instantlye requyres, her husband home to hast. And so to shyps they go, and saile so longe, till at the last Marseille hauen they take: anoyed of the seas, And therfore then on horsebacke they do ryde in better ease To Thurin: wheare they lyued to gether longe in ioye, And perfect loue. But now, the lorde Mandozze in anoye Doth lyue, for absence of the Duchesse all this while, His harte abode with her, and he dyd liue in longe exile. But when he knew, how that the Duke was commen thyther: And how the Duchesse fayre, and hee returned home to gether: His greife he doth sustayne, seynge no remedye: He neades must now make vertue of extreame necessitie, Determininge to goe, to Thurin her to see, But now this while, y? all these th?gs in such a state they bee, The Alma[illeg.]anes latelye with an armye huge they are, Cum into fraunce, and so do spoyle, the contrey euery wheare. As sone as of the same, the kynge doth vnderstand, He sendeth to the noble Duke of Sauoy, out of hande With armye great of fraunce to encounter with his foes, But all thinges in good order set at home before he goes He doth appoynt for his leiuetenaunt generall The countye Pancalyer, to whom thaffayres and charge of all Hys Duchy he dothe leue, that as hys selfe alwaye, The Countie, in his absence they should honour and obaye. The Countie well was knowne both noble and dyscreate: And for to take the rule and charge of c?men wealthe most meate. The noble men thearto agree: The people well contented bee. So when he seeth hym selfe, to haue the charge alone The contrey to dyspose and rule, commaundyng euery one: Yet markinge well oft tymes the Duchesse beutye braue, Can not c?maund hys lust, the rule, vpon hym selfe to haue. He hath no force, to fyght against his new desyre, His flames do burne in broil?g brest, he fryes in secrete fyre, The more he sekes alwayes for to withstand his ill: The poyson strong so much the more dothe rage and rancle styll. That whyle he stryueth so the smoke for to suppresse: In greater flames the furyous fyre doth more and more increase, Reason dothe bid him rule his rage, and to obaye In absence of the Duke, as ought a subiect true alwaye, But fancye doth enforce his follye to fulfyll. So battayle in his brest begynnes, betwext his wit and will, But reason at the laste is fayne to flye the fyeld. His sences all subdued, is constrayned for to yeld Unto a Fortresse vyle, he can resyste nomore. But now with shame dothe seke the salue for to recure his sore. So that he doth forget him selfe so muche, that he Thearof doth make no conscience to offer seruice free. Unto the Duchesse: which had vowd alwayes to lyue Upryghtly. And therfore to him a warnynge she doth gyue; That from thencefurthe he be aduysed better in His cause, before he do presume so bouldlye to begin Unto vnlawfull loue, A Pryncesse for to moue. She byds him seeke abroade Wheare as his matches bee: To practise such conclusions with them of his degree. She chauseth much that be of her so light should deeme: To thinke that then her honour shee so lytle should esteeme. And shame to him, shee saide that lyued all that whyle: And yet a dotinge fole, could not subdue affections vyle. The Countie Pancalir when this he dothe perceaue. Was sum what blanke, so for y? tyme of her he takes hys leue. Yet hopynge still the best, the fyrste denienge he At wom?s mouthes doth know right well but words of course to be. Wherfore wyth higher style, he moues his cause agayne Another tyme: when that at large he pleades his case more playne. Desyringe her to take sum pitie on his greyfe, Or els he can not longe sustayne, to lead his lothsum lyfe. He sayth, his sences fayle, his meate doth not disgest: His faynting lymmes haue lost their force his bodie takes no rest. For loue of her alone and addeth thearunto, That all his lymbes haue now forgot theyr dutyes for to do. As he dothe thus a whyle his wofull case bewaile: She asketh if his wittes alwith his sences do not fayle: A stronger salue she sekes for his increasynge ill. Sith y? her warning would not serue but he continews still, His syege: by hard Assault to make a breache within Her honoure: Of her chastitie, the fort full stronge, to winne. Countie, she saith Me thinke the warninge which before I gaue: myght haue perswaded you to trouble me nomore, These enter pryses rashe, and will you styll pursue: For gettinge how my lorde, the duke hath heare aduaunced you. Is this the Guerdon meate which you to him restore? And dyd he make you his Lieuetenant now therfore, That you vppon his bed the rule also should take? Is this the right discharge, which you of that same credyt make. Is this (I praye.) thallegeance due, Or seruyce of a subiect true? I promyse you, that if you will not thus forgoe These follyes. I will see that you shalbe corrected so, That subiectes from hence furthe and traytours false, they shall Therby ex?ple take. And thus you maye be warnd for all. What confydence (I praye) myght make you now so bould: That you to me so hardylye so traytrous mynd vnfould: Wax wyser from hence furthe, to make your matche alwaye. I am your princesse whom you ought to honour and obaye: The Countie skooled thus: that lessen in his brayne Imprinted is so well, that it will neuer out agayne. Disdaining much of her to be refused so, And countinge that the Duke therof at his retourne should know, His loue to deadlie spyte is changed. He alwaye Inuenteth sundrie meanes to bringe the Duchesse to decaye. And as he tosseth so his mischeife in his mynd: A polecye for him at last, the Dyuells grace doth fynd. He had a Nephue then, not full nyntene years ould, One of the brauest gentlemen, In Thurin to behould The Countye hauynge then no children: he dyd take This for his owne, and after him his onelye heyre to make So on a time to him my Nephue he doth saye. Thou knowest how that but me thou hast no other helpe or staye. And therfore for because, that God hath geuen to me No lawfull Issue now, myne heyre I haue appoynted thee, If thou canst haue the grace to folow so my mynd: Especiallye in thinges which you may for your profyt fynde. The ould vnlustie Duke is now from home afarre, And manie chaunginge chaunces still do happen in the warre. If he should chaunce to dye, as doubtfull is his lyfe, Tis possyble that you myght get the Duchesse to your wife. And so. God knowes how great Aduauncement it myght be To the. And y? wer wonne with ease (as it appeares to me) If that hearein, you would my counsell well obey. Thoughe to the poynt of maryage, it maye not com strayght waye, Yet sure, you shall not fayle a frend of her therby. To haue. By many sundrye thinges ere this, I did espie: She bare thee much good will and neuer durste before Let it besene. Wherfore do then stycke stoutlye euermore Hearto. And take the hap, whatsoeuer it do cost: Do what you can to please her styll it is no labour lost. Seke all the meanes ye maye, To serue her euery waye. And tyme shall teache you well at last, the same to see: Which youth &amp; want of skill till now hath hid alwayes from the. This symple youthe beleues his oncles wretched wyles. The craftye Fowlers pype full sone the selye byrde beguyles, He thinkes that all is Gould that glystreth to the eye. The Tutcstone of experyence he wantes the same to trye, He dothe begin: about the Duchesse, for to be Alwaies. And shamfastlie by sygnes, he mours her so to see: How he with willynge mynde To serue her was enclynde. Whice when he had obserued, a monthe or twayne lyke wyse: The gentle Duchesse at the last his dylygense espyes, And honeste seruyce whyche wyth earnest zeale, he had Done her of late. And so therfore the Duchesse, she was glad To fauoure hym the more, prefarrynge hym aboue The other pages. And therto his comlye grace doth moue The more. Of wantonnes proceaded not her loue. For his good seruice don to her: She dyd hym onelye so preferre. But now the vncle false none other thinge dothe he: But longeth of the Duchesse styll auenged for to be. And thynkynge now for all, at double or quyte to playe: He calles his Nephue once agayne, and in this sorte doth saye. I see, that now thou art the hapieste man alyue: If you can take the lucky lot, as fortune doth it geue, Not onelye great good will, the Duchesse beares to the: But now with feruent loue, to syght consumed much is she. But wemen, (as ye see) They sumwhat shamfast be. They loue to be desyred in secret place alwaie. A certaine force doth please th? well. as thoughe constrayned they Do yeald, and graunt to that whyche they ryght glad and fayne Would offer: If a lytell shame dyd them not still restraine. Be hardie then sayth he, this to beleue thearfore. For I haue proued and found it true, ryght often heare to fore, And that before this time tomorowe, thou shalt saie, Thy selfe to be the happiest man, that lyues on earth this daye. And thearfore now I would sumtime, ye should espye, Unto the Duchesse chamber soone, to goe ryght priuely. Under her bed also, thy selfe thear must thou hyde, Tyll after mydnight past an howre at least still to abyde. And when she dothe begyn in depest sleape to fall: From vnderneath the bed, aryse furthwith you shall, And brauely commynge to her bed, you shall declare That loue dyd cause your comminge theare &amp; tell her who you are. So be you sure of thys what for her feruent loue, And absence of the Duke so longe: both these lykewyse wyll moue Her, then in foulded armes Most louynglye tembrace The sone, &amp; chear thy hart with ioyes of louers sweete solace The sely youth beleues his vncles wordes streyght waye Supposinge that the Duchesse might perswade him so to say. Him selfe dyd thinke no hurte and therfore doubtes no yll, And so his vncles traytrous mynd furthwyth he doth fulfyll. For then the Countye was obayed as a kynge, And honoured euen as the Duke him selfe in euerye thinge. Before that mydnyght came. the traytour false in doubt, Lest that his shamfull vylanye myght be espyed out, Thre of the counsell, with sum of the garde also He takes, and to the chamber of the Duchesse streyght doth goe. Wheare knockynge at the dore, he willeth then to saye, The Duke was cum and so, the dore was opeded wyde straight waye. With naked swerd in hand the Countye rushethe in, And ragynge lyke a man out of his wittes he doth begin To pray on euerye syde, the chamber rounde about. And so, from vnderneath the bed at last he pluckethe out His Nephue all amasd, and tremblinge then for feare: Lyke as the lambe which yet alyue the rauenynge wolfe doth teare. To whom denyeng power one word at last to saye: Hee thrustes him through y? throt &amp; th? w? dobled stripe, streghtway He strykes hym in the brest, that he myght quyckely lose His breath, &amp; be without the power, his treason to desclose. And now poore innocent, vpon the ground he lyes His limmes being stiffe, his striuing lyfe dothe yeald to destinyes. His blade with blood embrewe, the Countye putteth in His sheath againe. And thus dothe to the counsellers begyn. My frendes (sayth he) this same was not fyrste tyme, that I The wanton and vnhonest loue betwene them dyd espye. But now at last, I found a tyme the truth to trye, But yet this gloton heare, I made to fayre a death to dye. For his desert requyres, by rygour of the lawe: That horses wyld, in quarters shuld, his traytrous bodye drawe. As for my Ladye heare, the Duchesse, at this tyme I leaue. I can no punyshment determyne for her cryme. You know the customes ould of Sauoye, do requyre: That Ladyes of adulterye conuicted should in fyre Be burnyd quycke, if they Within a yeare and daye, Fynd not a Champion, which in theyr behalfe will fyght The Combate: by his force in feyld for to defend their ryght. But for the allegeance of my dutye, which I owe Unto my Lorde the Duke, I wyll by letters let him knowe Heareof. And so, the while, the Duchess shall remayne Within her chaumber close, &amp; haue with her one mayde or twayne. The Duchesse knowes her selfe now faultles for to be. And is in minde, amased muche so great outrage to see. But well the treason of The Countye she espyes. And lokynge on her pages corps with piteous wepynge eyes, Wyth sygheng sundrye tymes, O gyltles soule (saith she) Which heare this lyueles corse hast left now thou dost playnlie see. The wyckednes of hym, Which made the thus to dye. And hauinge made an end vnto her mone, and mornefull crye She wringes her armes for woe and doth desyre: that they Would let the corse in semlye graue be buryed strayght waye. For he hath not deserued, to hange on gibet hye: And to be meat for bestes, or byrdes, which in the ayre do flye, She sayth. And so her mynde, the counsellers fullfyll, Misdeaming in theyr mindes y? more because that she did still. Excuse the giltles page of that offence alwaie, And for to purge her selfe nothing at all doth saie, The wofull chaunce full sone is blowne about the cyttie. And of the gentle Duchesse, then not one but taketh pytye, Exept the Countie fyerce, in myschefe hardned so: That he could neuer bend, but styll is workinge of her woe, Fame with these newes continually Full fast, alwayes doth further flye Suche murmuring amonge the people doth aryse, As though the towne weare then subdeud to spoyle of ennemies. And many of them wolde with ryght good will, agree That on them and theyr children th? her punyshment should bee: In thys condysyon that, the Duchesse myght go free. The County Pancalier dyd nothing all this daye, But made the accusacyons fayne that all the councell maye, Set to theyr seales furthwyth, all whych in order done, He sendes two postes in hast thearw?, and into England one, To shew the kynge her brother, And to the Duke the other. Is gon. And both theyr charge full soone presented haue, The brother, and the husband both, they easelye credyte gaue Thearto. And cheyfly they perswaded are thearby: Because the Uncle so had made hys Nephew for to dye, Whych should haue bene his heyre, without some haynous misse And so the Countie his faithfulnes they much commend in this: That to his blood he dyd no whyt forgeue or spare, To testefye the faythfulnes that to his prynce he bare. So fynely for a tyme, Hys crafte did cloke the cryme. Though suche offence a whyle may vnder asshes lye, Yet treason wil sumtime be knowne and time the trueth shall try. What worser foe, then he whych euer doth deceyue, Pretendyng frendshyp, so that one may hardly hym perceyue, Thys traytrous tyrant heare, appearinge for to be. A Iudge most iust in mischeyfe nowe commended muche is he, It is the most pernycyous ill: In vertues shape deceauyng styll. The kynges of England, and of Fraunce, at last agree, In fauour of the Duke: the lawe and custome kepte shalbee Uppon the Duchesse iust, to the ende all Ladyes might Example take thearby, whiche ought to soyne lyke lampes of lyght In vertues fayre, to others: vnlawfull lustes to leaue. And by hys post agayne, that tyme, the Countie doth receaue A ryche and costly swerd, and harneys exellent: Whyche hym to gratyfye wythall, the kynge of England sent. The Duke of Sauoye stayes hys post a whyle, because The matter toucheth him so neare: he takes the longer pause. But at the last, he is resolued here vnto, He wrytes vnto his councell that on payne of lyfe: they do Ryght streightly execute the statutes on his wyfe, As her offence requyred then, and not to spare her lyfe. And to the Countie he besydes, doth letters sende, His truth well tryed, &amp; seruice good he highlye doth commende. And promyseth to hym due recompence to make. The post aryued, the letters to the counsell soone doth take. And so: (the letter red) they do forthwith agree Accordynge to the custome oulde: a pyller theare shalbee Of marble stone, set vp within a feild theareby, Wheareon the accusacion, must be wrytten formallye: Whiche when the Duchesse heares, hauynge no companye But with one Damsell yonge, &amp; eke her mayden Emelye: All comfortlesse, wyth greife on euery syde oppreste, As tr?ticke, rentes her gould? heare and beating on her breste With mortall syghes, shee doth her lucklesse lot bewaile: So that for sorowe so extreme, her speache a while dyd fayle, She ceased not of longe her selfe for to torment, the teares apace, ran downe her face. her maydens do lament, Her pyteous carefull case, and euer (as they maye) They do desyre her, that she wolde take pacience alwaye. And so at laste, she lyftes her ioyned handes on hie: Desyrynge God to looke vpon, her, in that miserie. With many prayers, she desyreth him to sende Some helpe her innocencye so furthwith for to defende. That she by such releife her harte reuyued so: May be released of her greife, tryumphing of her foe. Now wofull Emblin, which the daunger great doth see, And knowynge then assuredlye her gyltlesse for to bee. By wonted polycye for her shee did prouyde, And saieng, Madame neade requires to laye your teares asyde, And not to spend the tyme, with childishe wepynge now: All which can not amend your ill. me thynkes it best for you Sume comforte here to take. and be of better cheare: The sheyld of pacyence alwayes against your foe to beare. And now w? speade, sum kind of waie To helpe your neade, let vs assaie. Now serche within your minde, Draw all your wits heare to. The shifte whiche one could not out find we all may chaunce to do. This daunger may perswade you corage for to take. Now let vs see, what shyfte all wee at such a pynch can make. Assaie, if you can finde the meanes, furthwith to sende Good maister Appian, in haste to goe, vnto your friend The Lord Mandozze: whose, so much renowmed fame for force, aboue all knights of spaine. aduaunced is his name. And therfore I would wyshe you for to wryte a letter To him, in louing wordes, that hee, may lyke of it the better. For I knowe no man sure, that would aduenture nowe His life so straungelye: if that hee, do not so much for you, Consideringe, the prowes of the Countie so is knowne: y? so?d?g trump of fame, with praise his name abroade hath blowne. You wotte, how that he is reported for to be, Most valyant and couragious knight [illeg.] Sauoye. Who but hee? The Duchesse then, doth bid her doe euen as shee will. For I (sayth shee) am comfortlesse, and hardned in myne ill. To lyue or dye, to me, the choyse dothe seme alone: Sithe euery waye, my honoure thus for euer more is gone, How euer it be, no [illeg.] I see Both ills do come alyke to mee. Madame, saythe Emelye let God therfore prouyde. And let vs handle this so well, that we be not espyed. So Inke and paper, she furthwyth to her doth brynge, And sayth madame, let not your hart fayle you in any thynge. The Duchesse drawes asyde, perusynge in her spryght The longe dyscourse of all the loue, betweene her and the knyght. To whom in fourme, as foloweth, her letter she dyd wryte. My Lord Mandozze, I The letter of the Duchesse, to Lord Mandozze. wryte not on hope to haue Suche remedye by this: that you, m selye lyfe myght saue. Nor feare of dreadfull deathe, dothe moue me heare vnto. The zeale of my good will to you, doth make me thus to do. The sorowes sonke within my heauye harte, do now Compell me to declare my carefull case to you. Thys stile so rude perchaunce at fyrste, may make you muse From whence the letters cum, but if it please you to peruse The same you shall perceiue how that your louing friend: (If you vouchsafe pore fr?ds to haue) thys greetyng now doth send. The same whych you sumtime, a princesse glad did see: A prisoner to shamefull death condemned for to bee, You scantly will beleue, but yet I feele it so. Though you (perchaunce) may much disdaine a captyue for to kno. Sith lucklesse starres enforce, and [illeg.] doth permit Thys same to be sith Fortune now consenteth vnto it, Contented, I must take good corage vnto me, Knowynge the graue, a fortresse and a castell stronge to be, Whearas agaynst such harde assaultes, we saufely may Take rest, and yet from fort?es force defende our selues alwaye, Whearfore with fyxed eyes, I do behoulde the graue. Alwayes the onely hope for helpe, and comforte that I haue, Thys onely fault, I do in this my death espye: That by the treason of my foe, I am condemde to dye. And thearfore thoughe theat by desert I can not craue Sum grace of you, though I can loke no helpe of you to haue: Yet will I now present before your eyes, how I Forsoke my contrey, whear so longe I lyued dayntelye In honour great, and ease, to put my selfe vnto So many peryls, as but fewe of myne estate would doe, Chaungyng my life which I, before that tyme had styll Enioyed in happy quietnes, with pleasures at my wyll, To take on me the attyre, a Pylgryme pyld to be, By hyls and dales, on foote to goe, the wayes vnknowne to me, For passynge feruent loue, which I dyd beare to you, Whom th? I had not sene, wherfore me thinkes these same, may now Your conscyence assault so sore: that thys may make Your gentell harte, on my ill lucke sume pitie for to take, For I, not onelie in a paynfull prison lye, But to a cruell Tyrantes power, a subiect nowe am I. And more then that, eche howre, in daunger for to lose My lyfe, which I full sone to do with all my hart wolde chose: Whearto I had my selfe, aduaunced longe agoe, (To haue rested in another lyfe.) saue that by doynge so, I should myne honour, lose, and leaue vnto my name An herytage of infamye, for to dyscend with shame. And therfore syth that loue Doth beare wyth it no pryce, Nor can not pay it selfe, excepte the trybute do aryse From other loue: yet paye the auncyent frutes most due Unto my loue: so shall I saye, I found your promyse true. So shall you paye, the hyre Which frendshyp doth require. And sythe, to Paradyse that pytie is the gate: Behould a wofull Pryncesse now, a wretche most desolate, Which looks for nothinge els But latest destenie, For to be burnd as selye lambe prepard to sacrifyce. And that I thinke, you would, be very lothe to see: Or els dessembling wordes, ere this haue muche beguyled me: The rest, this bearer now, by worde of mouth maye tell: Whom as my selfe you maie be bold for to beleue him well. And so accownt of him in euerye case I praie. And saufelye, vnto him commit, your counsells styll you maie, (Yf it shall please you so) and thus I make an end, Desiringe God good life to you, to me, fayre dethe to lend. The letter sealed vp, fayre Emelie doth take It sone. And willeth Appian all speade thearwith to make. And to thintent he should consider that the better: A dosen kisses sweete also, she geues him with the letter, And neade inoughe. For he poore soule was shronke awaye For thought. she gaue h? not so much before then, manie a daie, Well cheared vp is he, more gladder muche he is, Then if an hundreth pounds of coine he had in place of this. Within his face, againe appeareth liuelie blood. The blessed lyps of Emelye had done him so great good, That his purgacions and paltrye physike, suche: For his disease, by twenty partes could not auayle as muche. He trotteth now, about his busines by and by. He pratleth to hym selfe apace, as pleassant as a Pye. And sondry notes he tuneth to the name of Emelye. He passeth not a whyt, in anie place to goe: Sith that his mysterysse, he may get out of a prison so. He was so glad and fayne, her hest for of obaye: That he to trauaile ceased not, as well by night, as daie, Till that aryued in Spayne, neare to the place to heare he Did knowe the Lord Mandozze erst was wonte most times to be. So theare, he askes his host both how, and in what place That Lord was th?. which tould him how he was in very ill case As any knyght mygth be, Fyr why: of late (saith he) Hys auncient ennemies Tolledoes, whom before In euerie skirmishe, he was wonte to vanquishe euermore: With such an armye, they are entred on his lande: That Lord Mandozze was to weake theyr force for to withstande. For once discomfayted, his souldiers fled awaye Unto a litle towne, which is beseiged at this daie. And there him self w? much hard pain His enmies might doth yet sustaine. Sir Appian then, doth take a guide to leade the waye, Which bringeth him so neare y? campe that well the towne he maye Descrye. So backe a gaine the guide furthwith he sent: And sone also him selfe vnto a captaine doth present. Receaued then he is a souldier for to be. Now Appian was wise enoughe, as sone as he doth see, That they to skyrmishe did begin, Am?gest the thickest he thrusteth in. That he a prisoner being toke, was led awaye, Into het towne, and so, the souldyers he doth praie: That streyght vnto theyr cheife, the Lord Mandozze, he Might then be led. And so as sone, as him the Lord doth see He knowes him well enoughe, synce he in Spaine before, Had with the Duchesse bene, as of her counsell euer more. But vnderstandinge of the meanes, whearby into The towne he came, he did perceyue. a great good will to do, His seruice true: heare in, his misteresse to obaye, Which durst his life to hassard so, as he had done that daye. The Duchesse letter then, syr Appian doth delyuer: The Lord goes to his ch?ber streight and calleth Appian thither. When he had red it all: he willeth him streight waye, To tell his charge. So Appian, in this sorte beginnes to saye. The Duchesse at this time thun hapiest Ladie aliue, To your good graces euermore, Her selfe dothe wholye geue. And humblye you requyres, not for to take it ill, That she from Galyce did depart, and could not fyrst fulfyll, Her promyse made to you, that shee At her returne your house would see. Desyrynge you vppon, the Duke to laye the blame, Whose haste vnportunate, that time did only cause the same Howbeit her hart (I knowe) with you remayned still, Though fortune did not serue so wel: theare wanted no good will. Shee was constrayned to obaye: Agaynst her mynde to go awaye. To testifie, the truth he speakes: The teares apace fall downe his cheakes And th?, doth shew y? loues of countie Pancalio: How that forspite, when he could not obtayne his vyle desyre, Under her bed did get his Nephue for to lie, Whom so, with his owne handes, he hath enforced for to dye. In prosses of his tale, hee dooth declare at laste: Then prysonment, and hard decree, agaynst the Duches past, The Lorde Mandozze nowe conceyueth very ill Opinyon of the Duchesse, which he did dyssmble styll Before syr Appian To whom, my freind (saith he) If that my fortune did not speake thys tyme, enough for me, Inlonge descourse I wolde furthwith declare to you, The wofull myseryes, with which I am oppressed now. So that, I am so much vnable for to ayde The Duchesse: y? my selfe eche houre of death may be afrayde. And now (ye see) the force, and power that I haue: Is all to lytle heare my men and gooddes from spoyle to saue. As for myne owne, I am so sorye for her woe: That nothinge can I doe heare in, I pray you tell her so. Wyth comendatyons such, as harte can best deuyse. Unluckye fortune to vs bothe, thys lot at once lykewise Hath geuen, that as we dyd in ioyfull myndes egree: So with like cause of care, we now together captyues be. So, we with time, be turned thus: When fortune lyst to play wyth vs. And so, a skyrmyshe great, hee makes wythout delaye Vppon his foes: that Appian myght saufelye go his waie. The whylst. He is escaped so. And home w? heauie cheare dothe goe. But beinge wise, and did Mandozze his daunger see. Thought his excuse alowable, on reason good to bee. So when to Thurian he [illeg.] come: to Emelye He calleth all. And she vnto the Duchesse by and by Goes in and sayth, madame God make you stedfast styll In trouble. For [illeg.] Appian hath brought you tidinges ill, And so thunfortunate Mandozze, and his case She snowes, and how from him at all theare is no hope of grace. When that the Duchesse heard, the state that he was in: O ruthfull cheare, that she did beare, her colour did begine To faile. And she furthwith vnto her selfe doth saie. O most vnhappy accursed wretche, of all that liue this daie, For soke on euery syde, thou nedest not to doubt. But now, the lighte of this thy life beginneth to goe out. Now doth drawe on, sithe that no fauoure I can fynde: Wheras I thought my succour sure, ahlas, ah knight vnkind. Now all to late I lothe my lust: which into Spayne, Did driue me ouer hyls and dales, with labour lost in vaine. Now haue I cause for to repent me of my payne. But let it passe. Beinge done, it can not be to do againe. Now now at last I knowe, the loue and great good will Which I did beare to thee: it was begynnynge of myne ill. And God, not Fortune hath prouided this for me, An Hypocrite. For fayned vew a fyt rewarde to be, Then Emelye in doubte lest she should vse sum rage Upon her selfe, toth saye that she which is a princesse sage Exhertacion to [illeg.] Translator Should not take on, her selfe so strangelye to torment, Consyderinge that afflyctions from heauen to vs are sent, To proue our pacyence alwayes if we can be content, For to confesse vs worthye of a greater punyshment. You know, that sum theare be that neuer lyued in ioye: By theyr example you maye learne to suffer sume anoye. For certaynly, (we see) such greyfes, and troubles are The tokens true, which do the loue of God to vs declare, For whom he suffereth in synnes vnponysht styll: The Lord hath lett, an turnd hym lose, vnto hys owne will. The crosse of Christe, we should ryght gladly beare therfore. Our paynes weare due to our desert if they weare ten tymes more. Beare this therfore I praye: referringe all vnto The Lord. Alas, the Duchesse sayth, how well the healthy, doe Geue counsell to the sycke, if you dyd feele my sore, Thou woldst with me complaine &amp; crye: on sorowes euermore. And therfore, leue me now for to bewaile my woe. My harte opprest, with burden great it may be eased so. Though I right gladly now, dyssemble this my paine: Yet cloude smokie of burning sighes wolde quicklye me constrayne To breathe into the ayre my smouldring sorowes so, To ease the painfull payse of care, to voide my brest of woe. That comforte do I see, in mydst of myserye Remaininge onely vnto me: last ease before I dye. My hart full fraight wyth scare, is lyke to burste in twaine. A hump: by the TranslatorMy force doth faile, my sences quaile, by payne of pinchinge paine. O ground gape thou on wyde, my selie soule receaue. Syth in dystresse, all comfortlesse Now me my frynde doth leaue, O gentle death come now, refuse not her to take, Whom euerye one ahlas: a wretche, doth vtterlye forsake. What hope of helpe haue I, When that my frend doth me denie. O Lachisis leue now, to spyn my fatall thred, Wheat by my life prolonged is. tys tyme the same to shred From clewe to bygge dispatche o dolefull destenies, Make hast, that this your stint weare done shut vp my wofull eyes. You mournefull damned spryghtes and Furies systers sad, Cum sit w? me, my mates most meet in wofell weades iclad. Singe to my mourning songe, with dreadfull shreking crye, Syth giltlesse I condemned am a shamefull deathe to dye. But now the Duchesse in her dumpes, we leaue alone, In sondry raginge fyts as she contineweth in her mone Tyll time may weare her woe and qualifye her greyfe, Or god which doth the trueth well know shall send her sum releife. Mandozze now, this whyle restes not by nyght or daye: But thinketh on the Duchesse and her woefull case allwaye. At last him selfe dothe see, that hee vnworthy weare: The worship of a knight to haue or noble armes to beare: If he for feare, to helpe the afflycted shoulde denie, Especyalye such Ladye fayre whose force alone dothe lye In teares, theyr wretchednes alwaies to wepe and wayle, And with him selfe by thys, at last so much he doth preuaile. That he disheryted, to dye woulde rather chose In honour, then to liue longe tyme and his good name to lose For want of corage, so remembringe with the same How that in hys presperitie to hym the Duchesse came. How can I now (sayth he) forsake her in her woe? Ten deathes to dye, more lefe had I then once to fayle her so. Thus, sone he order geues for all thinges neadfull to Defence of such a towne. And doth furthwith to Thurin goe, With horse and harnesse good: as anye man myght neade. And so aryued at Thurin, he enquyred theare with speade, If anye Spanyardes be in towne. And so he heares But of one olde relygious man, which theare this twenty yeares Had ben. An holie man, and eke beloued well, Of all the Cytezens. Whych then without the towne did dwell Alone, in cottage lowe, that he might so eschew, The loue &amp; lust of worldly thinges, his flesh for to subdew. Such is relygious lyfe, he lyued not in ease, Lyke epycures in houses hye such places as myght please A Prince ryght well: as they which sumpteouslye did fare And lyue in rest, neade who so lyst, they take no kynd of care. The myghtie God doth see, theyr lothsome lustes at last: And Baals prestes prophane he doth from out his temple cast. But now the Spanyshe knyght hath learned the nearest waye, Unto the ould fathers house, to wh? (good man) he fyrst doth saye. I am a Spanyard borne, and cum this countrey into, For certaine my affayres: wherfore I praye, thus much to doe On charitie as, heare to let me lodge with you These thre or els foure daies at most desyringe nothinge now But lodginge at your hand. my seruant which you see, All other my necessities. He maye prouide for me. The good ould man at fyrst, dyd gladlye graunt him this: And masynge at his semelie shape: when that his seruant is Gone furthe into the towne to bye Such thinges as should theyr neade suply He asketh him his name. and of what shire in spayne He is. All which the gentle knight to him confesseth plaine, The good ould man with teares, that fast fall from his face Doth saie. O God I geue the thankes which hast geuen me the grace, In this mine ould age, now to see before I die Within my house so great a Lord, whose seruaunt poore am I. And so this father oulde. in longe dyscourse doth tell Of many matters past. And how he knew his grandsyre weil. And further him he doth desyre, as bouldly theare. For toc? [illeg.] his house, as thoughe within his owne he weare. So then Mandozze tells how that he came from Spayne, Entendinge into France to goe, a while theare to remaine, And how that passinge furthe by, Liouus, he did heare, Thill fortune of the Duchesse. whom if that he wyst she weare Ungiltie of the cryme, he saith, he wold defend Her right. Or thearin euery drop of his hart blood to spend. But in no wise he wold aduenture anye time His lyfe, and soule, for to defend an other bodies crime, All which the good ould man, then lyked verie well: And saithe, my lord I thinke it sure, no one alyue can tell The truth hearem, except the Duchesse poore, and he Which hath accused her. But sure, as farre as we could see, She hath bene euermore a Princess good and iust. But for the Countie Pancalyer, which by our coustom must Approue the same by fyght: (beleue [illeg.] if you lust) But sure methinkes you are to younge his force to abyde, His manlike might &amp; courage stout hath often tymes ben tryed. Of all men heare, he is estemed for to be Most hardye and redoubted knyght, that is in Lomberdye. But yet the victorie, in God his handes doth rest. And that he wyll dispose alwaies as it shall please him best. Euen as by Dauid it appeareth verye plaine: Which then a boye Goliah great, the Giant fearce hath slaine. The knight doth answere him, a waie I haue found out, To satisfye my conscience, and to dissolue my doubt. But I heare to, small good can doe, whearfore I must heare in Be bould to craue, some ayde to haue of you eare I begin. Under the colour to confesse the Duchesse: I The truth maie know, and so if you thinke good, imediatly: I will be polde, and haue my beard cleane cut a waie, And get me garmentes like to yours for so me thinkes we maie Be suffred sone vnto The Duchesse for to goe. I thinke we should haue lycence, (sith that the time drawes neare) To exorte her styll with pacience, her troubles for to beare, The good ould father glad, to him doth then agre As well for zeale, as reuerence to his nobylitie. And so prouision made for all thinges fit thearto: Like freirs, to the castell of the Duchesse streight they goe. He that the noble knight attyred so should see: Would skantlie then haue taken him so great a Lorde to be. What with the iestures sitt, which he so well could faine, And greyfe for wars at home, al with the Duchesse woes againe, Made him to looke more like a Pylgrim porely fed. Which lyke S. Iohn in wyldernes his lyfe alone had lead, Then anie lustie Lord. when to the Castell they Weare cum the good ould man vnto the porter sene doth saye. My masters seing that the time doth drawe so nye Whearin the Duchesse as I heare endemned is to dye. We are come now thearfore, to exhort her patiently To take her death, that she may gain eternall lyfe thearby. They to her chamber are, admytted to goe in. And then Mandozze: frier fayre, to her doth thus begin. The peace of God with you, the Duchesse then doth saie. Good father, why speake you of peace and I in stryfe alwaie Abyde, bereft of ioye, gyltlesse condemnde to dye, A shamfull cruell death also to heape my myserye. Mandozze then, which had his youth in learning spent. Madame saithe he, you knowe right well. afflictions all be sent From God. Not come by chaunce, no byrd is caught in net. But by the prouidence of God, which doth not it forget. The Prophete Amos saith, theare neuer chauncethe ill Within the citie: but the same the lord doth send it still. And that by holye Iob, appeareth verie plaine: On whom the deuell had no power till he did leaue obtaine. Of God. You must besure, that tribulacions are The tokens true which plainly doe thelected flocke declare. It shewes a certaine sygne that God regardeth vs. Read al the holy scriptures through, and you shall fynde it thus, To drinke in cup of his. passion, he doth prepare For them whom he doth loue, as such as his elected are. Since that by Caim fyrst Abell afflicted was: And Isaake by Ismaell, his brother in like case. And Ioseph iuste, whom his owne brothers once did sell, Loke on the Lordes elected flocke children of Israell, Whom vnder the Aegiptyan kynge The Lord did vnto bondage bringe. And led them thence againe, Through Seas in midst deuyded To happy land at last. Which for his people he prouyded. Consider this also the which saint Paule doth saie. That if we had not hope in Chryst, but for this lyfe alwaye: We myght account our selues most wretched wightes to be. The very beastes that fead on grasse weare nothinge worse then we, Our greife is small, to that which Christ for vs dyd beare. The myghty god which of the worlde dyd make the goodlye spheare, And all thearin, to whom. bothe heauen and earthe obayes, Which fixed starres in skies hath set and axe of heauens stayes: Did suffer to be called, sonne of a Carpenter: A dyuelishe man, a glotton, and of sinners fauourer. And falce seductour. Then consider heare vnto That we myght better clothed be how barely he did goe. A prysoner also, he was content to bee: That we from hel, &amp; Sathans bands for euer myght be free. Hym selfe a sacryfyce, on alter of the crosse Was offered also, for to repayre ould Adams losse. Remember then that from his griefe, proceades our ioye, And fr? his paynes, our perfect blisse, the ease of our anoye. The cause why he sustained greyfe: Was certaynely for our releyfe. Then we shoulde be ashamed so dayntye for to be: A crowne of thornes to beare awhile wherfore madame, (sayth he) Euen in the name of God, take comfort nowe I praye. Dispise this death, &amp; arme your selfe with pacience alway. For God hath force full soone the furie of your foe To tame, for to suppresse his rage. doth not the Lorde also Regarde thaflicted flocke: respect the people poore? He whiche doth raise the fallen folke, can you agayne restore To greater ioye, and ease then that, you had before The waylinge wretches woe hee sees, with piteing eye. And heares the mournfull mone of them that liue in myserye. He is the happie Hauen. for hartes that be opprest: The comfort to the comfortlesse, the wearye bodies rest. To them in darknes, he doth giue the louelie light. Repose your hope in him. Make him your Champyon for to fight. The persecuted poore, (Saint Mathew sayth:) they bee The blessed ones, which shal of heau? the happie kyngdome see. And with his godlie talke when that the knight had done: The Duchesse was so rauished in contemplacion, That then her soule, should seeme to tast immediatlye Of ioyes deuine, &amp; would furthwyth from out her bodie flye. Shee feeles her selfe euen then to be aledged so, As one in daunger great of late escaped had thearfro. And then shee doth confesse her mynde and nothinge leaue Behinde, which she remembred then her coscience to greaue. But then at last vnto her accusation shee Doth saye. I will not aske my God, absolued for to bee, For anie cryme in deede, or thought: against the right Of maryage, excepted this that to a spanishe knight, Once heretofore, (I wote) I was affected so: That fayning for deuocion, to see him I did goe. Wythout that euer he had any thynge of mee: Saue that good will alone, whearin to him I did agree. Whearfore my God displeasd, hath suffred nowe, I see, These accusations false on me so lewdlye layde to be: But seynge that it is his will. I houlde my selfe contented still. When in this sorte, all her confession was done: A Diamond ryche from finger fayre, she draweth of anon, And sayth, fayre father I a Pryncesse ryche haue bene But all my goodes, and Iuels now from me are taken cleane, Saue this same rynge, the whiche the kynge my brother gaue Mee, at my maryage daye: and for because I haue No other meanes to do you good: I geue you this. And kepe it wel, you know not what the valewe of it is. Perchaunce it maye releyfe your Couent at a neade. The Rynge receyued is. And home the Fryers trudge with speade. When they weare paste the place Mandozze by and by With earnest gesture, then doth say, good father I espy: This woman pore, is nowe hearein accused wrongfully. The Co?ty (Traitour vile) w? shame deserued hath to die. And therfore now, I am determined to fyght, Untill last breath of all my lyfe, for to defende her ryght. I feele my selfe at harte, to be attaynted so, That longe me thinkes the time, tyll to the purpose I may go. Wherfore, if I do fayle by fortune ill I praye, After that I am slayne, let me be knowen abrode strayght waye And let the Duchesse beare this heauye newes of me: But if I skape aliue (whiche is vnpossyble to be,) But by the Co?tie hys death then keape all my affayres In cecret still And so that night being spent in godlie prayers, When daye so cleare had made the darksome cloudes to flye: And Horse full led with Amrosie drewe Phaebus in the skye: He makes him selfe to be in Armour surely dyght, And to the towne on Courser strong furth rydes the valyant knyght. And knockyng at the gate with thundryng voyce doth saye Unto a Porter my good freinde I praye thee go thy waye, To Countie Pancalyer, and bid him to prepare, Him selfe, for to maintaine the same which he doth heare declare Against the Duchesse iuste: and that heare is a knight Which will compell him to denye the same, eare it be night. And that I will cut of that vile and trayterous tonge: Which durst prono?ce y? wordes to do so noble a Princesse wronge. Let him come out, him selfe the better to acquite: For of the traytour chuffe I thinke, it longe to haue a sighte. I hope with heaue and how to be vppon his Iacke. That he shall thinke, he beares the diuell vpon his backe. These newes are blowen about the Citie by and by: And all the paryshe churches full of folkes, one might espye, Which for their Ladie, now to God on high do praye. So whilst this ambassage was done, Mandozze rydes his waye, On lustie fomynge steade vnto the Piller wheare, The accusation written was, and so, abydeth theare To see Thaccuser come. but wh? the Countie this doth kno Remorse of conscience doth pynche &amp; prycke him so: That in his mynde he did endure such preuie payne, That then repentyng him, he would haue ben right glad and fayne, The deede had ben vndone, and dayntie for to fight. He seketh still delayes, and fyrste vnto the Spanishe knight, He sendes a messenger, of hym, to aske his name. To whom Mandozze stoutly sayth, he shall not knowe the same. But sure for all the rest, what power in hym doth lye, He shall it know and feele forthwith, if then he lyste to trye. The Iudges theare also, affyrmed in the same: How that their statutes do not bynde him for to shew his name. And further in the case, the Lawyers all do saye: How that thaccused partye ought to see the fyght alwaye. And reason yelde, not for because theyr bookes so be: But in Fauorem vitÃ¦ was the cause of that decree. Which when the Countie heares althoughe he dyd dystrust His parte: yet of necessitie make manhode now he must. And beinge vsed to suche skirmishes before. He armes him selfe forthwith and feareth lesse therfore And settynge vp his brystels then, lyke as the forest Bore: Unto thappoynted place he comes, and theare doth see His foe in Armoure blacke well harnessed to be, In sygne of combate then. he semes alustie knyght. And brauelye prauncyng vp &amp; downe he feareth not to fyght. So then the Duchesse fayre was sent for out of hand: Whiche is not sorye sure inoughe these newes to vnderstand. Yet in her ioyfull mynd, alwayes much museth shee, Fr? wh?ce thunhoped help doth cum, or who that knyght should bee, That then had promised to do so muche for her. So she is caryed to the feyld within an horselytter, Beyng couered with tylt of Blacke. Accompanyed With number great of Ladies fayre and damsells by her syde, Attired all in blacke. they bryng her to the place Whear as the people, &amp; the knightes did tarie for her grace. Thus then shee mounted is vppon a litle stage: Sreight waye the Iudges which the feild appointed weare to gage, Demaund of her sith that she is accused by The Countie Pancalyer, as gyl- tie of adulterie, And sith the custome is, that you a champion maye Prouide, bi fight, to proue your right Within a yeare and daye, How saye you now thearfore, Madame, do you agree By this same knight your innocence approued nowe maye be? Will you that on his force alone your right shall lie? If you by him wyll wage your lawe, your fautlesse truth to trye, Speake now what you thinke best, And theare on shall the issue rest. The Duchesse answereth, I do repose my ryght In God which knowes the same, &amp; in the manhode of the knight. To him my cause c?mit do I: Indifferent to liue or dye. But tost in troubled mynde, she thinketh sure that hee A stranger neuer knowne to her: sum captaine stoute should bee. So on her knees she falles, and lyftyng vp her eyes: O Lord that art on highe (saith she) The Prayer of the duchesse by the translatour. in throne aboue the skies, Thou knowest the truthe vntryed. O Lorde maintaine my part. Pleade thou my cause, for y? doest see the secretes of my hart. No cloked craft so close, that anie man can hyde But vnto thee discouered, the same is well espied. Let not this tyrant fearce which thriftes my blood to spill, Triumphe on my simplicitie. confound him in his will. O Lorde which thy poore flocke, from Wolues defendest still: Let not this blooddy butcher nowe thy selie Lambe heare kyll. O Lorde looke downe at laste, turne not awaye thy face From sinners poore. Bestow on me the tresure of thy grace. Thou seest my innocence thou knowest the payne and smart That I endured haue, to thee, I do commit my part. As Hester thou didst helpe when shee did make her mone: So Lord helpe mee for why my hope remaynes in thee alone As Susan fayre, thou didst delyuer in her woe.
