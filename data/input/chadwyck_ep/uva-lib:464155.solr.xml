      <field name="fulltext">THE METAMORPHOSIS of Pigmalions Image. AND Certaine Satyres. TO THE WORLDS MIGHTIE MONARCH, GOOD OPINION Sole Regent of Affection, perpetuall Ruler of Iudgement, most famous Iustice of Censures, onely giuer of Honor, great procurer of Aduancement, the Worlds chiefe Ballance, the All of all, and All in all, by whom all things are that they are. I humbly offer thys my Poem. Thou soule of Pleasure, Honors only substance, Great Arbitrator, Vmpire of the Earth, Whom fleshly Epicures call Vertues essence, Thou moouing Orator, whose powrefull breath Swaies all mens iudgements. Great OPINION, Vouchsafe to guild my imperfection. If thou but daine to grace my blushing stile, And crowne my Muse with good opinion: If thou vouchsafe with gracious eye to smile Vpon my young new-borne Inuention, Ile sing an Hymne in honor of thy name, And add some Trophie to enlarge thy fame. But if thou wilt not with thy Deitie Shade, and inmaske the errors of my pen, Protect an Orphane Poets infancie, I will disclose, that all the world shall ken How partiall thou art in Honors giuing: Crowning the shade, the substance praise depriuing. W. K. To his Mistres. My wanton Muse lasciuiously doth sing Of sportiue loue, of louely dallying. O beauteous Angell, daine thou to infuse A sprightly wit, into my dulled Muse. I inuocate none other Saint but thee, To grace the first bloomes of my Poesie. Thy fauours like Promethean sacred fire, In dead, and dull conceit can life inspire. Or like that rare and rich Elixar stone, Can turne to gold, leaden inuention: Be gracious then, and daine to show in mee, The mighty power of thy Deitie. And as thou read'st, (Faire) take compassion, Force me not enuie my Pigmalion. Then when thy kindnes grants me such sweet blisse, I'le gladly write thy metamorphosis. PIGMALION THE ARGVMENT of the Poem. Pigmalion whose chast mind all the beauties in Cyprus could not ensnare, yet at the length hauing carued in Iuorie an excellent proportion of a beauteous woman, was so deeplie enamored on his owne workmanship, that he would oftentimes lay the Image in bedde with him, and fondlie vse such petitions and dalliance, as if it had been a breathing creature. But in the end, finding his fond dotage, and yet perseuering in his ardent affection, made his deuout prayers to Venus, that shee would vouchsafe to enspire life into his Loue, and then ioyne them both together in marriage. Wherevpon Venus graciously condiscending to his earnest sute, the Mayde, (by the power of her Deitie) was metamorphosed into a liuing Woman. And after, Pigmalion (beeing in Cyprus,) begat a sonne of her, which was called Paphus, wherupon, that Iland Cyprus, in honor of Venus, was after, and is now, called by the inhabitants, Paphos. 1 Pigmalion, whose hie loue-hating minde Disdain'd to yeeld seruile affection, Or amorous sute to any woman-kinde, Knowing their wants, and mens perfection. Yet Loue at length forc'd him to know his fate, And loue the shade, whose substance he did hate. 2 For hauing wrought in purest Iuorie, So faire an Image of a Womans feature, That neuer yet proudest mortalitie Could show so rare and beautious a creature. (Vnlesse my Mistres all-excelling face, Which giues to beautie, beauties onely grace.) 3 Hee was amazed at the wondrous rarenesse Of his owne workmanships perfection. He thought that Nature nere produc'd such fairenes In which all beauties haue their mantion. And thus admiring, was enamored On that fayre Image himselfe portraied. 4 And naked as it stood before his eyes, Imperious Loue declares his Deitie. O what alluring beauties he descries In each part of his faire imagery! Her nakednes, each beauteous shape containes. All beautie in her nakednes remaines. 5 He thought he saw the blood run through the vaine And leape, and swell with all alluring meanes: Then feares he is deceiu'd, and then againe, He thinks he see'th the brightnes of the beames Which shoote from out the fairenes of her eye: At which he stands as in an extasie. 6 Her Amber-coloured, her shining haire, Makes him protest, the Sunne hath spread her head With golden beames, to make her farre more faire. But when her cheeks his amorous thoughts haue fed, Then he exclaimes, such redde and so pure white, Did neuer blesse the eye of mortall sight. 7 Then view's her lips, no lips did seeme so faire In his conceit, through which he thinks doth flie So sweet a breath, that doth perfume the ayre. Then next her dimpled chin he doth discry, And views, and wonders, and yet view's her still. âLoues eyes in viewing neuer haue their fill. 8 Her breasts, like polisht Iuory appeare, Whose modest mount, doe blesse admiring eye, And makes him wish for such a Pillowbeare. Thus fond Pigmalion striueth to discry Each beauteous part, not letting ouer-slip One parcell of his curious workmanship. 9 Vntill his eye discended so farre downe That it discried Loues pauillion: Where Cupid doth enjoy his onely crowne, And Venus hath her chiefest mantion: There would he winke, &amp; winking looke againe, Both eies &amp; thoughts would gladly there remaine. 10 Who euer saw the subtile Citty-dame In sacred church, when her pure thoughts shold pray, Peire through her fingers, so to hide her shame, When that her eye, her mind would faine bewray. So would he view, and winke, and view againe, A chaster thought could not his eyes retaine. 11 He wondred that she blusht not when his eye Saluted those same parts of secrecie: Conceiting not it was imagerie That kindly yeelded that large libertie. O that my Mistres were an Image too, That I might blameles her perfections view. 12 But when the faire proportion of her thigh Began appeare. O Ouid would he cry, Did ere Corinna show such Iuorie When she appear'd in Venus liuorie? And thus enamour'd, dotes on his owne Art Which he did work, to work his pleasing smart. 13 And fondly doting, oft he kist her lip. Oft would he dally with her Iuory breasts. No wanton loue-trick would he ouer-slip, But full obseru'd all amorous beheasts. Whereby he thought he might procure the loue Of his dull Image, which no plaints coulde moue. 14 Looke how the peeuish Papists crouch, and kneele To some dum Idoll with their offering, As if a senceles carued stone could feele The ardor of his bootles chattering, So fond he was, and earnest in his sute To his remorsles Image, dum and mute. 15 He oft doth wish his soule might part in sunder So that one halfe in her had residence: Oft he exclaimes, Ã´ beauties onely wonder, Sweet modell of delight, faire excellence, Be gracious vnto him that formed thee, Compassionate his true-loues ardencie. 16 She with her silence, seemes to graunt his sute. Then he all iocund like a wanton louer, With amorous embracements doth salute Her slender wast, presuming to discouer The vale of Loue, where Cupid doth delight To sport, and dally all the sable night. 17 His eyes, her eyes, kindly encountered, His breast, her breast, oft ioyned close vnto, His armes embracements oft she suffered, Hands, armes, eyes, tongue, lips, and all parts did woe. His thigh, with hers, his knee playd with her knee, A happy consort when all parts agree. 18 But when he saw poore soule he was deceaued, (Yet scarce he could beleeue his sence had failed) Yet when he found all hope from him bereaued, And saw how fondly all his thoughts had erred, Then did he like to poore Ixion seeme, That clipt a cloud in steede of heauens Queene. 19 I oft haue smil'd to see the foolery Of some sweet Youths, who seriously protest That Loue respects not actuall Luxury, But onely ioy's to dally, sport, and iest: Loue is a child, contented with a toy, A busk-point, or some fauour still's the boy. 20 Marke my Pigmalion, whose affections ardor May be a mirror to posteritie. Yet viewing, touching, kissing, (common fauour,) Could neuer satiat his loues ardencie: And therefore Ladies, thinke that they nere loue you, Who doe not vnto more then kissing moue you. 21 For my Pigmalion kist, viewd, and imbraced, And yet exclaimes, why were these women made O sacred Gods, and with such beauties graced? Haue they not power as well to coole, and shade, As for to heate mens harts? or is there none Or are they all like mine? relentlesse stone. 22 With that he takes her in his louing armes, And downe within a Downe-bed softly layd her. Then on his knees he all his sences charmes, To inuocate sweet Venus for to raise her To wished life, and to infuse some breath, To that which dead, yet gaue a life to death. 23 Thou sacred Queene of sportiue dallying, (Thus he begins,) Loues onely Emperesse, Whose kingdome rests in wanton reuelling, Let me beseech thee show thy powerfulnesse In changing stone to flesh, make her relent, And kindly yeeld to thy sweet blandishment. 24 O gracious Godesse, take compassion. Instill into her some celestiall fire, That she may equalize affection, And haue a mutuall loue, and loues desire. Thou know'st the force of loue, then pitty me, Compassionate my true loues ardencie. 25 Thus hauing said, he riseth from the floore, As if his soule diuined him good fortune, Hoping his prayers to pitty moou'd some power. For all his thoughts did all good luck importune. And therefore straight he strips him naked quite, That in the bedde he might haue more delight. 26 Then thus, Sweet sheetes he sayes, which nowe doe couer, The Idol of my soule, the fairest one That euer lou'd, or had an amorous louer. Earths onely modell of perfection, Sweet happy sheetes, daine for to take me in, That I my hopes and longing thoughts may win. 27 With that his nimble limbs doe kisse the sheetes, And now he bowes him for to lay him downe, And now each part, with her faire parts doe meet, Now doth he hope for to enioy loues crowne: Now doe they dally, kisse, embrace together, Like Leda's Twins at sight of fairest weather. 28 Yet all's conceit. But shadow of that blisse Which now my Muse striues sweetly to display In this my wondrous metamorphosis. Daine to beleeue me, now I sadly say. The stonie substance of his Image feature, Was straight transform'd into a liuing creature. 29 For when his hands her faire form'd limbs had felt, And that his armes her naked wast imbraced, Each part like Waxe before the sunne did melt, And now, oh now, he finds how he is graced By his owne worke. Tut, women will relent When as they finde such mouing blandishment. 30 Doe but conceiue a Mothers passing gladnes, (After that death her onely sonne hath seazed And ouerwhelm'd her soule with endlesse sadnes) When that she sees him gin for to be raised From out his deadly swoune to life againe: Such ioy Pigmalion feeles in euery vaine. 31 And yet he feares he doth but dreaming find So rich content, and such celestiall blisse. Yet when he proues &amp; finds her wondrous kind, Yeelding soft touch for touch, sweet kisse, for kisse, He's well assur'd no faire imagery Could yeeld such pleasing, loues felicity. 32 O wonder not to heare me thus relate, And say to flesh transformed was a stone. Had I my Loue in such a wished state As was afforded to Pigmalion, Though flinty hard, of her you soone should see As strange a transformation wrought by mee. 33 And now me thinks some wanton itching eare With lustfull thoughts, and ill attention, List's to my Muse, expecting for to heare The amorous discription of that action Which Venus seekes, and euer doth require, When fitnes graunts a place to please desire. 34 Let him conceit but what himselfe would doe When that he had obtayned such a fauour, Of her to whom his thoughts were bound vnto, If she, in recompence of his loues labour, Would daine to let one payre of sheets containe The willing bodies of those louing twaine. 35 Could he, oh could he, when that each to eyther Did yeeld kind kissing, and more kind embracing, Could he when that they felt, and clip't together And might enioy the life of dallying, Could he abstaine mid'st such a wanton sporting From doing that, which is not fit reporting? 36 What would he doe when that her softest skin Saluted his with a delightfull kisse? When all things fit for loues sweet pleasuring Inuited him to reape a Louers blisse? What he would doe, the selfe same action Was not neglected by Pigmalion. 37 For when he found that life had tooke his seate Within the breast of his kind beauteous loue, When that he found that warmth, and wished heate Which might a Saint and coldest spirit moue, Then arms, eyes, hands, tong, lips, &amp; wanton thigh, Were willing agents in Loues luxurie. 38 Who knowes not what ensues? O pardon me Yee gaping eares that swallow vp my lines Expect no more. Peace idle Poesie, Be not obsceane though wanton in thy rhimes. And chaster thoughts, pardon if I doe trip, Or if some loose lines from my pen doe slip, 39 Let this suffice, that that same happy night So gracious were the Gods of marriage Mid'st all there pleasing and long wish'd delight Paphus was got: of whom in after age Cyprus was Paphos call'd, and euermore Those Ilandars do Venus name adore. FINIS. SATYRES. The Authour in prayse of his precedent Poem. Now Rufus, by old Glebrons fearefull mace Hath not my Muse deseru'd a worthy place? Come come Luxurio, crowne my head with Bayes, Which like a Paphian, wantonly displayes The Salaminian titillations, Which tickle vp our leud Priapians. Is not my pen compleate? are not my lines Right in the swaggering humor of these times? O sing Peana to my learned Muse. Io bis dicite. Wilt thou refuse? Doe not I put my Mistres in before? And pitiously her gracious ayde implore? Doe not I flatter, call her wondrous faire? Vertuous, diuine most debonaire? Hath not my Goddesse in the vaunt-gard place, The leading of my lines theyr plumes to grace? And then ensues my stanzaes, like odd bands Of voluntaries, and mercenarians: Which like Soldados of our warlike age, March rich bedight in warlike equipage: Glittering in dawbed lac'd accoustrements, And pleasing sutes of loues habiliments. Yet puffie as Dutch hose they are within, Faint, and white liuer'd, as our gallants bin; Patch'd like a beggars cloake, and run as sweet As doth a tumbrell in the paued street. And in the end, (the end of loue I wot) Pigmalion hath a iolly boy begot. So Labeo did complaine his loue was stone, Obdurate, flinty, so relentlesse none: Yet Lynceus knowes, that in the end of this, He wrought as strange a metamorphosis. Ends not my Poem then surpassing ill? Come, come, Augustus, crowne my laureat quill. Now by the whyps of Epigramatists, Ile not be lasht for my dissembling shifts. And therefore I vse Popelings discipline, Lay ope my faults to Mastigophoros eyne: Censure my selfe, fore others me deride And scoffe at mee, as if I had deni'd Or thought my Poem good, when that I see My lines are froth, my stanzaes saplesse be. Thus hauing rail'd against my selfe a while, Ile snarle at those, which doe the world beguile With masked showes. Ye changing Proteans list, And tremble at a barking Satyrist. CERTAINE SATYRES SATYRE. 1. Quedam videntur, et non sunt. I cannot show in strange proportion, Changing my hew like a Camelion. But you all-canning wits, hold water out, Yee vizarded-bifronted-Ianian rout. Tell mee browne Ruscus, hast thou Gyges ring, That thou presum'st as if thou wert vnseene? If not. Why in thy wits halfe capreall Lett'st thou a superscribed Letter fall? And from thy selfe, vnto thy selfe doost send, And in the same, thy selfe, thy selfe commend? For shame leaue running to some Satrapas, Leaue glauering on him in the peopled presse: Holding him on as he through Paules doth walke, With nodds and leggs, and odde superfluous talke: Making men thinke thee gracious in his sight, When he esteemes thee but a Parasite. For shame vnmaske, leaue for to cloke intent, And show thou art vaine-glorious, impudent. Come Briscus, by the soule of Complement, I'le not endure that with thine instrument (Thy Gambo violl plac'd betwixt thy thighes, Wherein the best part of thy courtship lyes) Thou entertaine the time, thy Mistres by: Come, now lets heare thy mounting Mercurie, What mum? giue him his fiddle once againe, Or he's more mute then a Pythagoran. But oh! the absolute Castilio, He that can all the poynts of courtship show. He that can trot a Courser, breake a rush, And arm'd in proofe, dare dure a strawes strong push. He, who on his glorious scutchion Can quaintly show wits newe inuention, Aduauncing forth some thirstie Tantalus, Or els the Vulture on Promethius, With some short motto of a dozen lines. He that can purpose it in dainty rimes, Can set his face, and with his eye can speake, And dally with his Mistres dangling feake, And wish that he were it, to kisse her eye And flare about her beauties deitie. Tut, he is famous for his reueling, For fine sette speeches, and for sonetting; He scornes the violl and the scraping sticke, And yet's but Broker of anothers wit. Certes if all things were well knowne and view'd He doth but champe that which another chew'd. Come come Castilion, skim thy posset curd, Show thy queere substance, worthlesse, most obsurd. Take ceremonius complement from thee, Alas, I see Castilios beggery. O if Democritus were now aliue How would he laugh to see this deuill thriue! And by an holy semblance bleare mens eyes When he intends some damned villanies. Ixion makes faire weather vnto Ioue, That he might make foule work with his faire loue, And is right sober in his outward semblance, Demure, and modest in his countenance; Applies himselfe to great Saturnus sonne, Till Saturns daughter yeeldes his motion. Night-shining PhÅbe knowes what was begat, A monstrous Centaure, illegitimate. Who would not chuck to see such pleasing sport. To see such troupes of gallants still resort Vnto Cornutos shop. What other cause But chaste Brownetta, Sporo thether drawes? Who now so long hath prays'd the Choughs white bill That he hath left her ne're a flying quill: His meaning gain, though outward semblance loue, So like a Crabfish Sporo still doth moue. Laugh, laugh, to see the world Democritus Cry like that strange transformed Tyreus. Now Sorbo with a fayned grauity Doth fish for honour, and high dignity. Nothing within, nor yet without, but beard Which thrice he strokes, before I euer heard One wise graue word, to blesse my listning eare. But marke how Good-opinion doth him reare. See, he's in office, on his foot-cloth placed: Now each man caps, and striues for to be graced With some rude nod of his maiestick head, Which all doe wish in Limbo harried. But Ã´ I greeue, that good men daine to be Slaues vnto him, that's slaue to villany. Now Sorbo swels with selfe conceited sence, Thinking that men doe yeeld this reuerence Vnto his vertues: fond credulity! Asse, take of Isis, no man honours thee. Great Tubrios feather gallantly doth waue, Full twenty falls doth make him wondrous braue. Oh golden Ierkin! royall arming coate! Like ship on Sea, he on the land doth flote. He's gone, he's shipt, his resolution Pricks him (by heauen) to this action. The poxe it doth: not long since I did view The man betake him to a common stew. And there (I wis) like no quaint stomack't man Eates vp his armes. And warres munition His wauing plume, falls in the Brokers chest. Fie that his Ostridge stomack should disgest His Ostridge feather: eate vp Venis-lace. Thou that did'st feare to eate Pore-Iohns aspace. Lie close ye slaue at beastly luxury; Melt and consume in pleasures surquedry. But now, thou that did'st march with Spanish Pike before, Come with French-pox out of that brothell dore. The fleet's return'd. What newes from Rodio? Hote seruice, by the Lord, cryes Tubrio. Why do'st thou halt? Why six times throgh each thigh Pusht with the Pike of the hote enemie. Hote seruice, hote, the Spaniard is a man, I say no more, and as a Gentleman I serued in his face. Farwell. Adew. Welcome from Netherland, from steaming stew. Asse to thy crib, doffe that huge Lyons skin, Or els the Owle will hoote and driue thee in. For shame, for shame, lew'd liuing Tubrio Presume not troupe among that gallant crue Of true Heroike spirits, come vncase, Show vs the true forme of Dametas face. Hence, hence ye slaue, dissemble not thy state But hence-forth be a turne-coate, runnagate. Oh hold my sides, that I may breake my spleene, With laughter at the shadowes I haue seene. Yet I can beare with Curios nimble feete Saluting me with capers in the streete. Although in open view, and peoples face, He fronts me with some spruce, neate, sinquepace. Or Tullus, though when ere he me espies Straight with loud mouth (a bandy Sir) he cries. Or Robrus, who adic't to nimble fence, Still greetes me with Stockadoes violence. These I doe beare, because I too well know They are the same, they seeme in outward show. But all confusion seuer from mine eye This Ianian-bifront hypocrisie. SATYRE. 2. Quedam sunt, et non videntur. I that euen now lisp'd like an Amorist, Am turn'd into a snaphaunce Satyrist. O tytle, which my iudgement doth adore! But I dull-sprighted fat Boetian Boore, Doe farre of honour that Censorian seate. But if I could in milk-white robes intreate Plebeians fauour, I would shew to be Tribunus plebis, gainst the villany Of these same Proteans, whose hipocrisie, Doth still abuse our fond credulity. But since my selfe am not imaculate, But many spots my minde doth vitiate, I'le leaue the white roabe, and the biting rimes Vnto our moderne Satyres sharpest lines; Whose hungry fangs snarle at some secret sinne. And in such pitchy clouds enwrapped beene His Sphinxian ridles, that old Oedipus Would be amaz'd and take it in foule snufs That such Cymerian darknes should inuolue A quaint conceit, that he could not resolue. O darknes palpable! Egipts black night! My wit is stricken blind, hath lost his sight. My shins are broke, with groping for some sence To know to what his words haue reference. Certes (sunt) but (non videntur) that I know. Reach me some Poets Index that will show. Imagines Deorum. Booke of Epithites, Natales Comes, thou I know recites, And mak'st Anatomie of Poesie. Helpe to vnmaske the Satyres secresie. Delphick Apollo, ayde me to vnrip, These intricate deepe Oracles of wit. These darke Enigmaes, and strange ridling sence Which passe my dullard braines intelligence. Fie on my senceles pate; Now I can show Thou writest that which I, nor thou, doo'st know. Who would imagine that such squint-ey'd sight Could strike the worlds deformities so right. But take heede Pallas, least thou ayme awry Loue, nor yet Hate, had ere true iudging eye. Who would once dreame that that same Elegie, That faire fram'd peece of sweetest Poesie, Which Muto put betwixt his Mistris paps, (When he (quick-witted) call'd her Cruell chaps, And told her, there she might his dolors read Which she, oh she, vpon his hart had spread) Was penn'd by Roscio the Tragedian. Yet Muto, like a good Vulcanian, An honest Cuckold, calls the bastard sonne, And brags of that which others for him done. Satyre thou lyest, for that same Elegie Is Mutos owne, his owne deere Poesie: Why tis his owne, and deare, for he did pay Ten crownes for it, as I heard Roscius say. Who would imagine yonder sober man, That same deuout meale-mouth'd Precisean, That cries good brother, kind sister, makes a duck After the Antique grace, can alwayes pluck A sacred booke, out of his ciuill hose, And at th'op'ning, and at our stomacks close Sayes with a turn'd-vp eye a solemne grace Of halfe an houre, then with his silken face Smiles on the holy crue, And then doth cry O manners! Ã´ times of impurity! With that depaints a church reformed state, The which the female tongues magnificate: Because that Platos odd opinion, Of all things (common) hath strong motion In their weake minds. Who thinks that this good man Is a vile, sober, damn'd, Polititian? Not I, till with his baite of purity He bit me sore in deepest vsury. No Iew, no Turke, would vse a Christian So inhumanely as this Puritan. Diomedes Iades were not so bestiall As this same seeming-saint, vile Canniball. Take heede Ã´ world, take heede aduisedly Of these same damned Anthropophagy. I had rather be within a Harpies clawes Then trust my selfe in their deuouring iawes. Who all confusion to the world would bring Vnder the forme of their new discipline. O I could say, Briareus hundred hands Were not so ready to bring Ioue in bands As these to set endles contentious strife Betwixt Iehoua, and his sacred wife. But see who's yonder, true Humility The perfect image of faire Curtesie. See, he doth daine to be in seruitude Where he hath no promotions liuelihood. Marke, he doth curtsie, and salutes a block, Will seeme to wonder at a wethercock, Trenchmore with Apes, play musick to an Owle, Blesse his sweet honours running brasell bowle: Cries (brauely broake) when that his Lordship mist, And is of all the thrunged scaffold hist. O is not this a curteous minded man? No foole, no, a damn'd Macheuelian. Holds candle to the deuill for a while, That he the better may the world beguile That's fed with shows. He hopes thogh som repine, When sunne is set, the lesser starres will shine: He is within a haughty malecontent, Though he doe vse such humble blandishment. But bold-fac'd Satyre, straine not ouer hie, But laugh and chuck at meaner gullery. In fayth yon is a well fac'd Gentleman, See how he paceth like a Ciprian: Faire Amber tresses of the fairest haire That ere were waued by our London aire, Rich laced sute, all spruce, all neat in truth. Ho Linceus! What's yonder brisk neat youth Bout whom yon troupe of Gallants flocken so? And now together to Brownes common goe? Thou knowst I am sure, for thou canst cast thine eie Through nine mud wals, or els odd Poets lie. Tis loose legg'd Lais, that same common Drab, For whom good Tubrio tooke the mortall stab. Ha ha, Nay then I'le neuer raile at those That weare a codpis, thereby to disclose What sexe they are, since strumpets breeches vse, And all mens eyes saue Linceus can abuse. Nay steed of shadow, lay the substance out, Or els faire Briscus I shall stand in doubt What sex thou art, since such Hermaphrodites Such Protean shadowes so delude our sights. Looke, looke, with what a discontented grace Bruto the trauailer doth sadly pace Long Westminster, Ã´ ciuill seeming shade, Marke his sad colours, how demurely clad, Staidnes it selfe, and Nestors grauity Are but the shade of his ciuility. And now he sighes. O thou corrupted age, Which slight regard'st men of sound carriage, Vertue, knowledge, flie to heauen againe Daine not mong these vngratefull sots remaine. Well, some tongs I know, some Countries I haue seene And yet these oily Snailes respectles beene Of my good parts. O worthles puffie slaue! Did'st thou to Venis goe ought els to haue? But buy a Lute and vse a Curtezan? And there to liue like a Cyllenian? And now from thence what hether do'st thou bring? But surpheulings, new paints and poysonings? Aretines pictures, some strange Luxury? And new found vse of Venis venery? What art thou but black clothes? Say Bruto say Art any thing but onely sad array? Which I am sure is all thou brought'st from France, Saue Naples poxe, and French-mens dalliance. From haughty Spayne, what brought'st thou els beside, But lofty lookes, and their Lucifrian pride? From Belgia what? but theyr deepe bezeling, Their boote-carouse, and theyr Beere-buttering. Well, then exclaime not on our age good man, But hence poluted Neopolitan. Now Satyre cease to rub our gauled skinnes, And to vnmaske the worlds detested sinnes. Thou shalt as soone draw Nilus riuer dry, As clense the world from foule impietie. SATYRE. 3. Quedam et sunt, et videntur. Now grim Reprofe, swel in my rough-heu'd rime, That thou maist vexe the guilty of our time. Yon is a youth, whom how can I ore'slip, Since he so iumpe doth in my mashes hit? He hath been longer in preparing him Then Terence wench, and now behold he's seene. Now after two yeeres fast and earnest prayer, The fashion change not, (least he should dispaire Of euer hoording vp more faire gay clothes) Behold at length in London streets he showes. His ruffe did eate more time in neatest setting Then Woodstocks worke in painfull perfecting. It hath more doubles farre, then Aiax shield When he gainst Troy did furious battell weild. Nay he doth weare an Embleme bout his necke. For vnder that fayre Ruffe so sprucely set Appeares a fall, a falling-band forsooth. O dapper, rare, compleat, sweet nittie youth! Iesu Maria! How his clothes appeare Crost, and recrost with lace, sure for some feare, Least that some spirit with a tippet Mace Should with a gastly show affright his face. His hat, himselfe, small crowne &amp; huge great brim, Faire outward show, and little wit within. And all the band with feathers he doth fill, Which is a signe of a fantasticke still, As sure, as (some doe tell me) euermore A Goate doth stand before a brothell dore. His clothes perfum'd, his fustie mouth is ayred, His chinne new swept, his very cheekes are glazed. But ho, what Ganimede is that doth grace The gallants heeles. One, who for two daies space Is closely hyred. Now who dares not call This Ãsops crow, fond, mad, fantasticall. Why so he is, his clothes doe sympathize, And with his inward spirit humorize. An open Asse, that is not yet so wise As his derided fondnes to disguise. Why thou art Bedlam mad, starke lunaticke, And glori'st to be counted a fantastick. Thou neyther art, nor yet will seeme to be Heire to some vertuous praised qualitie. O frantick men! that thinke all villanie The compleate honors of Nobilitie. When some damn'd vice, som strange mishapen sute, Makes youths esteeme themselues in hie repute. O age! in which our gallants boast to be Slaues vnto riot, and lewd luxury! Nay, when they blush, and thinke an honest act Dooth their supposed vertues maculate! Bedlame, Frenzie, Madnes, Lunacie, I challenge all your moody Empery Once to produce a more distracted man Then is inamorato Lucian. For when my eares receau'd a fearefull sound That he was sicke, I went, and there I found Him layd of loue, and newly brought to bed Of monstrous folly, and a franticke head. His chamber hang'd about with Elegies, With sad complaints of his loues miseries: His windowes strow'd with Sonnets, and the glasse Drawne full of loue-knots. I approcht the Asse, And straight he weepes, and sighes some sonnet out To his faire loue. And then he goes about For to perfume her rare perfection With some sweet-smelling pinck Epitheton. Then with a melting looke he writhes his head, And straight in passion riseth in his bed; And hauing kist his hand, stroke vp his haire, Made a French conge, cryes. O cruell feare To the antique Bed-post. I laught a maine That down my cheeks the mirthful drops did raine. Well he's no Ianus, but substantiall, In show, and essence a good naturall. When as thou hear'st me aske spruce Duceus From whence he comes. And hee straight answers vs, From Lady Lilla. And is going straight To the Countesse of (?) for she doth waite His comming. And will surely send her Coach, Vnlesse he make the speedier approch. Art not thou ready for to breake thy spleene At laughing at the fondnes thou hast seene In this vaine-glorious foole? When thou dost know He neuer durst vnto these Ladies show His pippin face. Well, he's no accident, But reall, reall, shamelesse, impudent. And yet he boasts, and wonders that each man Can call him by his name, sweet Ducean: And is right proude that thus his name is knowne. I, Duceus, I, thy name is too farre blowne. The world too much, thy selfe too little know'st Thy priuate selfe. Why then should Duceus boast? But humble Satyre, wilt thou daine display These open naggs, which purblind eyes bewray? Come, come, and snarle more darke at secrete sin, Which in such Laborinths enwrapped bin, That Ariadne I must craue thy ayde To helpe me finde where this foule monster's layd, Then will I driue the Minotaure from vs, And seeme to be a second Theseus. [SATYRE 4] REACTIO. Now doth Ramnusia Adrastian, Daughter of Night, and of the Ocean Prouoke my pen. What cold Saturnian Can hold, and heare such vile detraction? Yee Pines of Ida, shake your fayre growne height, For Ioue at first dash will with thunder fight. Yee Cedars bend, fore lightning you dismay, Yee Lyons tremble, for an Asse doth bray. Who cannot raile? what dog but dare to barke Gainst Phoebes brightnes in the silent darke? What stinking Scauenger (if so he will Though streets be fayre,) but may right easily fill, His dungy tumbrel? sweep, pare, wash, make cleane, Yet from your fairnes he some durt can gleane. The windie-chollicke striu'd to haue some vent, And now tis flowne, and now his rage is spent. So haue I seene the fuming waues to fret, And in the end, naught but white foame beget. So haue I seene the sullen clowdes to cry, And weepe for anger that the earth was dry After theyr spight, that all the haile-shot drops Could neuer peirce the christall water tops, And neuer yet could worke her more disgrace But onely bubble quiet Thetis face. Vaine enuious detractor from the good What Cynicke spirit rageth in thy blood? Cannot a poore mistaken title scape But thou must that into thy Tumbrell scrape? Cannot some lewd, immodest beastlines Lurke, and lie hid in iust forgetfulnes, But Grillus subtile-smelling swinish snout Must sent, and grunt, and needes will finde it out? Come daunce yee stumbling Satyres by his side If he list once the Syon Muse deride. Ye Granta's white Nymphs, come &amp; with you bring Some sillabub, whilst he doth sweetly sing Gainst Peters teares, and Maries mouing moane, And like a fierce enraged Boare doth foame At sacred Sonnets. O daring hardiment! At Bartas sweet Semaines, raile impudent At Hopkins, Sternhold, and the Scottish King, At all Translators that doe striue to bring That stranger language to our vulgar tongue, Spett in thy poyson theyr faire acts among. Ding them all downe from faire Ierusalem, And mew them vp in thy deserued Bedlem. Shall Painims honor, their vile falsed gods With sprightly wits? and shall not we by ods Farre, farre, more striue with wits best quintessence To adore that sacred euer-liuing Essence? Hath not strong reason moou'd the Legists mind, To say the fayrest of all Natures kinde The Prince by his prerogatiue may claime? Why may not then our soules without thy blame, (which is the best thing that our God did frame) Deuote the best part to his sacred Name? And with due reuerence and deuotion Honor his Name with our inuention? No, Poesie not fit for such an action, It is defild with superstition: It honord Baule, therefore polute, polute, Vnfit for such a sacred institute. So haue I heard an Heritick maintaine The Church vnholy, where Iehouas Name Is now ador'd: because he surely knowes Some-times it was defil'd with Popish showes. The Bells profane, and not to be endur'd, Because to Popish rites they were inur'd. Pure madnes peace, cease to be insolent, And be not outward sober, inlye impudent. Fie inconsiderate, it greeueth me An Academick should so senceles be. Fond Censurer! Why should those mirrors seeme So vile to thee? which better iudgements deeme Exquisite then, and in our polish'd times May run for sencefull tollerable lines. What, not mediocria firma from thy spight? But must thy enuious hungry fangs needs light On Magistrates mirrour? must thou needs detract And striue to worke his antient honors wrack? What, shall not Rosamond, or Gaueston, Ope their sweet lips without detraction? But must our moderne Critticks enuious eye Seeme thus to quote some grosse deformity? Where Art, not error shineth in their stile, But error and no Art doth thee beguile. For tell me Crittick, is not Fiction The soule of Poesies inuention? Is't not the forme? the spirit? and the essence? The life? and the essentiall difference? Which omni, semper, soli, doth agree To heauenly discended Poesie? Thy wit God comfort mad Chirurgion What, make so dangerous an Incision? At first dash whip away the instrument Of Poets Procreation? fie ignorant! When as the soule, and vitall blood doth rest And hath in Fiction onely interest? What Satyre! sucke the soule from Poesie And leaue him spritles? Ã´ impiety! Would euer any erudite Pedant Seeme in his artles lines so insolent? But thus it is when pitty Priscians Will needs step vp to be Censorians. When once they can in true skan'd verses frame A braue Encomium of good Vertues name. Why thus it is, when Mimick Apes will striue with Iron wedge the trunks of Oakes to riue. But see, his spirit of detraction Must nible at a glorious action. Euge! some gallant spirit, some resolued blood will hazard all to worke his Countries good And to enrich his soule, and raise his name will boldly saile vnto the rich Guiane. What then? must straight some shameles Satyrist with odious and opprobrius termes insist To blast so high resolu'd intention with a malignant vile detraction? So haue I seene a curre dogge in the streete Pisse gainst the fairest posts he still could meete. So haue I seene the march wind striue to fade The fairest hewe that Art, or Nature made. So Enuy still doth barke at clearest shine And striues to staine heroyick acts, deuine. well, I haue cast thy water, and I see Th'art falne to wits extreamest pouerty, Sure in Consumption of the spritely part. Goe vse some Cordiall for to cheere thy hart: Or els I feare that I one day shall see Thee fall, into some dangerous Litargie. But come fond Bragart, crowne thy browes with Bay Intrance thy selfe in thy sweet extasie. Come, manumit thy plumie pinion, And scower the sword of Eluish champion, Or els vouchsafe to breathe in wax-bound quill, And daine our longing eares with musick fill: Or let vs see thee some such stanzaes frame That thou maist raise thy vile inglorious name. Sommon the Nymphs and Driades to bring Some rare inuention, whilst thou doost sing So sweet, that thou maist shoulder from aboue The Eagle from the staires of freendly Ioue: And leade sad Pluto Captiue with thy song, Gracing thy selfe, that art obscur'd so long. Come somewhat say (but hang me when tis done) Worthy of brasse, and hoary marble stone; Speake yee attentiue Swaines that heard him neuer Will not his Pastorals indure for euer? Speake yee that neuer heard him ought but raile Doe not his Poems beare a glorious saile? Hath not he strongly iustled from aboue The Eagle from the staires of friendly Ioue? May be, may be, tut tis his modesty, He could if that he would, nay would if could I see. Who cannot raile? and with a blasting breath Scorch euen the whitest Lillies of the earth? Who cannot stumble in a stuttering stile? And shallow heads with seeming shades beguile? Cease, cease, at length to be maleuolent, To fairest bloomes of Vertues eminent. Striue not to soile the freshest hewes on earth With thy malitious and vpbraiding breath. Enuie, let Pines of Ida rest alone, For they will growe spight of thy thunder stone, Striue not to nible in their swelling graine With toothles gums of thy detracting braine: Eate not thy dam, but laugh and sport with me At strangers follies with a merry glee. Lets not maligne our kin. Then Satyrist I doe salute thee with an open fist. SATYRE [5] Parua magna, magna nulla. Ambitious Gorgons, wide-mouth'd Lamians, Shape-changing Proteans, damn'd Briareans, Is Minos dead? is Radamanth a sleepe? That yee thus dare vnto Ioues Pallace creepe? what, hath Ramnusia spent her knotted whip? That yee dare striue on Hebes cup to sip? Yet know Apolloes quiuer is not spent But can abate your daring hardiment. Python is slaine, yet his accursed race, Dare looke deuine Astrea in the face: Chaos returne, and with confusion Inuolue the world with strange disunion: For Pluto sits in that adored chaire which doth belong vnto Mineruas heire. O Hecatombe! Ã´ Catastrophe! Huc vsque Xylinum. From Mydas pompe, to Irus beggery. Promethius, who celestiall fier Did steale from heauen, therewith to inspire Our earthly bodies with a sence-full mind, whereby we might the depth of Nature find, Is ding'd to hell, and vulture eates his hart which did such deepe Philosophy impart To mortall men. When theeuing Mercury That euen in his new borne infancy Stole faire Apollos quiuer, and Ioues mace, And would haue filch'd the lightning from his place, But that he fear'd he should haue burnt his wing And sing'd his downy feathers new come spring; He that in gastly shade of night doth leade Our soules, vnto the empire of the dead. When he that better doth deserue a rope Is a faire planet in our Horoscope. And now hath Caduceus in his hand Of life and death that hath the sole command. Thus petty thefts are payed, and soundly whipt, But greater crimes are slightly ouerslipt: Nay he's a God that can doe villany with a good grace, and glib facility. The harmles hunter, with a ventrous eye When vnawares he did Diana spie, Nak'd in the fountaine he became straightway Vnto his greedy hounds a wished pray, His owne delights taking away his breath, And all vngratefull forc'd his fatall death. (And euer since Hounds eate their Maisters cleane, For so Diana curst them in the streame.) When strong backt Hercules in one poore night With great, great ease, and wondrous delight In strength of lust and Venus surquedry Rob'd fifty wenches of virginity. Farre more then lusty Laurence. Yet poore soule He with Acteon drinks of Nemis bole, When Hercules lewd act, is registred, And for his fruitfull labour Deified. And had a place in heauen him assigned When he the world, vnto the world resigned. Thus little scapes are deepely punished, But mighty villanes are for Gods adored. Ioue brought his sister to a nuptiall bed, And hath an Hebe, and a Ganemede, A Leda, and a thousand more beside, His chast Alcmena, and his sister bride: Who fore his face was odiously defil'd And by Ixion grosely got with child. This thunderer, that right vertuously Thrust forth his father from his empery Is now the great Monarko of the earth, Whose awfull nod, whose all commaunding breath Shakes Europs ground-worke. And his title makes As dread a noyse, as when a Canon shakes The subtile ayre. Thus hell-bred villany Is still rewarded with high dignity. When Sisyphus that did but once reueale That this incestious villane had to deale In Ile Phliunte with Egina faire, Is damn'd to hell, in endles black dispaire Euer to reare his tumbling stone vpright Vpon the steepy mountaines lofty height. His stone will neuer now get greenish mosse Since he hath thus encur'd so great a losse As Ioues high fauour. But it needs must be whilst Ioue doth rule, and sway the empery And poore Astrea's fled into an Ile And liues a poore and banished exile: And there pen'd vp, sighs in her sad lament, wearing away in pining languishment. If that Sylenus Asse doe chaunce to bray, And so the Satyres lewdnes doth bewray, Let him for euer be a sacrifice; Prick, spurre, beate, loade, for euer tyranise Ouer the foole. But let some Cerberus Keepe back the wife of sweet tongu'd Orpheus, Gnato applaudes the Hound. Let that same child Of Night, and Sleepe, (which hath the world defil'd with odious railing) barke gainst all the work Of all the Gods, and find some error lurke In all the graces. Let his lauer lip Speake in reproch of Natures workmanship, Let him vpbraid faire Venus if he list For her short heele. Let him with rage insist To snarle at Vulcans man, because he was Not made with windowes of transparant glas That all might see the passions of his mind. Let his all-blasting tongue great errors find In Pallas house, because if next should burne It could not from the sodaine perill turne. Let him vpbraide great Ioue with luxury Condemne the Heauens Queene of ielousie. Yet this same Stygius Momus must be praysed And to some Godhead at the least be raised. But if poore Orpheus sing melodiously, And striue with musicks sweetest symphonie To praise the Gods, and vnaduisedly Doe but ore-slip one drunken Deitie, Forthwith the bouzing Bacchus out doth send His furious Bacchides, to be reueng'd. And straight they teare the sweet Musition, And leaue him to the dogs deuision. Hebrus, beare witnes of their crueltie, For thou did'st view poore Orpheus tragedie. Thus slight neglects are deepest villanie, But blasting mouthes deserue a deitie. Since Gallus slept, when he was set to watch Least Sol or Vulcan should Mauortius catch In vsing Venus: since the boy did nap, Whereby bright PhÅbus did great Mars intrap. Poore Gallus now, (whilom to Mars so deere) Is turned to a crowing Chaunteclere; And euer since, fore that the sunne doth shine, (Least PhÅbus should with his all-piercing eyne Discry some Vulcan,) he doth crow full shrill, That all the ayre with Ecchoes he doth fill. Whilst Mars, though all the Gods doe see his sin, And know in what lewd vice he liueth in, Yet is adored still, and magnified, And with all honors duly worshipped. Euge! small faults to mountaines straight are raised, Slight scapes are whipt, but damned deeds are praised. Fie, fie, I am deceiued all thys while, A mist of errors doth my sence beguile; I haue beene long of all my wits bereauen, Heauen for hell taking, taking hell for heauen; Vertue for vice, and vice for vertue still, Sower for sweet, and good for passing ill. If not? would vice and odious villanie Be still rewarded with high dignity? Would damned Iouians, be of all men praised, And with high honors vnto heauen raised? Tis so, tis so; Riot, and Luxurie Are vertuous, meritorious chastitie: That which I thought to be damn'd hel-borne pride Is humble modestie, and naught beside; That which I deemed Bacchus surquedry, Is graue, and staied, ciuill, Sobrietie. O then thrice holy age, thrice sacred men! Mong whom no vice a Satyre can discerne, Since Lust, is turned into Chastitie, And Riot, vnto sad Sobrietie. Nothing but goodnes raigneth in our age, And vertues all are ioyn'd in marriage. Heere is no dwelling for Impietie, No habitation for base Villanie. Heere are no subjects for Reproofes sharpe vaine, Then hence rude Satyre, make away amaine; And seeke a seate where more Impuritie Doth lye and lurke in still securitie. Now doth my Satyre stagger in a doubt, Whether to cease, or els to write it out. The subiect is too sharp for my dull quill. Some sonne of Maya show thy riper skill. For I'le goe turne my tub against the sunne, And wistly marke how higher Plannets runne, Contemplating their hidden motion. Then on some Latmos with Endimion, I'le slumber out my time in discontent, And neuer wake to be maleuolent, A beedle to the worlds impuritie; But euer sleepe in still securitie. If thys displease the world's wrong-iudging sight, It glads my soule, and in some better spright I'le write againe. But if that this doe please, Hence, hence, Satyrick Muse, take endlesse ease. Hush now yee Band-doggs, barke no more at me, But let me slide away in secresie. FINIS. THE SCOVRGE OF Villanie. Three Bookes of Satyres. Nec scompros metuentia carmina, nec thus. PERSEVS. To his most esteemed, and best beloued Selfe, DAT DEDICATQVE. To Detraction I present my Poesie. Foule canker of faire vertuous action, Vile blaster of the freshest bloomes on earth, Enuies abhorred childe, Detraction, I heare expose, to thy all-taynting breath The issue of my braine, snarle, raile, barke, bite, Know that my spirit scornes Detractions spight. Know that the Genius, which attendeth on, And guides my powers intellectuall, Holds in all vile repute Detraction. My soule an essence metaphisicall, That in the basest sort scornes Critickes rage, Because he knowes his sacred parentage. My spirit is not huft vp with fatte fume Of slimie Ale, nor Bacchus heating grape. My minde disdaines the dungie muddy scum Of abiect thoughts, and Enuies raging hate. True iudgement, slight regards Opinion, A sprightly wit, disdaines Detraction. A partiall praise shall neuer eleuate My setled censure, of mine owne esteeme. A cankered verdit of malignant Hate Shall nere prouoke me, worse my selfe to deeme. Spight of despight, and rancors villanie, I am my selfe, so is my poesie. In Lectores prorsus indignos. Fy Satyre fie, shall each mechanick slaue, Each dunghill pesant, free perusall haue Of thy well labor'd lines? Each sattin sute, Each quaint fashion-monger, whose sole repute Rests in his trim gay clothes, lye slauering Taynting thy lines with his lewd censuring? Shall each odd puisne of the Lawyers Inne, Each barmy-froth, that last day did beginne To reade his little, or his nere a whit, Or shall some greater auncient, of lesse wit, (That neuer turnd but browne Tobacco leaues Whose sences some damn'd Occupant bereaues) Lye gnawing on thy vacant times expence? Tearing thy rimes, quite altering the sence? Or shall perfum'd Castilio censure thee? Shall he oreview thy sharpe-fang'd poesie? (Who nere read farther then his Mistris lips) Nere practiz'd ought, but som spruce capring skips Nere in his life did other language vse, But, Sweete Lady, faire Mistres, kind hart, deare couse, Shall this Fantasma, this Colosse peruse And blast with stinking breath, thy budding Muse? Fye, wilt thou make thy wit a Curtezan For euery broking hand-crafts artizan? Shall brainles Cyterne heads, each iubernole, Poket the very Genius of thy soule? I Phylo, I, I'le keepe an open hall, A common, and a sumptuous festiuall, Welcome all eyes, all eares, all tongues to me, Gnaw pesants on my scraps of poesie. Castilios, Cyprians, court-boyes, spanish blocks, Ribanded eares, granado-netherstocks, Fidlers, Scriueners, pedlers, tynkering knaues, Base blew-coats, tapsters, brod-cloth minded slaues, Welcome I-fayth, but may you nere depart, Till I haue made your gauled hides to smart. Your gauled hides? avaunt base muddy scum. Thinke you a Satyres dreadfull sounding drum Will brace it selfe? and daine to terrefie, Such abiect pesants basest rogary? No, no, passe on ye vaine fantasticke troupe Of puffie youthes; Know I doe scorne to stoupe To rip your liues. Then hence lewd nags, away, Goe read each post, view what is plaid to day. Then to Priapus gardens. You Castilio, I pray thee let my lines in freedome goe, Let me alone, the Madams call for thee Longing to laugh at thy wits pouertie. Sirra, liuorie cloake, you lazie slipper slaue, Thou fawning drudge, what would'st thou Satyres haue? Base mind away, thy master calls, begon, Sweet Gnato let my poesie alone. Goe buy some ballad of the Faiery King, And of the begger wench, some rogie thing Which thou maist chaunt vnto the chamber-maid To some vile tune, when that thy Maister's laid. But will you needs stay? am I forc'd to beare, The blasting breath of each lewd Censurer? Must naught but clothes, and images of men But sprightles truncks, be Iudges of my pen? Nay then come all, I prostitute my Muse, For all the swarme of Idiots to abuse. Reade all, view all, euen with my full consent, So you will know that which I neuer meant; So you will nere conceiue, and yet dispraise, That which you nere conceiu'd, &amp; laughter raise: Where I but striue in honest seriousnes, To scourge some soule-poluting beastlines. So you will raile, and finde huge errors lurke In euery corner of my Cynick worke. Proface, reade on, for your extreamst dislikes Will add a pineon, to my praises flights. O, how I bristle vp my plumes of pride, O, how I thinke my Satyres dignifi'd, When I once heare some quaint Castilio, Some supple mouth'd slaue, some lewd Tubrio, Some spruce pedant, or some span-new come fry Of Innes a-court, striuing to vilefie My darke reproofes. Then doe but raile at me, No greater honor craues my poesie. 1 But yee diuiner wits, celestiall soules, Whose free-borne mindes no kennel thought controules, Ye sacred spirits, Mayas eldest sonnes. 2 Yee substance of the shadowes of our age, In whom all graces linke in marriage, To you how cheerfully my poeme runnes. 3 True iudging eyes, quick sighted censurers, Heauens best beauties, wisedoms treasurers, O how my loue embraceth your great worth. 4 Yee Idols of my soule, yee blessed spirits, How shold I giue true honor to your merrits, Which I can better thinke, then here paint forth. You sacred spirits, Maias eldest sonnes, To you how cheerfully my poeme runnes. O how my loue, embraceth your great worth, Which I can better think, then here paint forth. O rare! [SATY: Liber primus.] PROEMIVM IN librum primum. I beare the scourge of iust Rhamnusia, Lashing the lewdnes of Britania. Let others sing as their good Genius moues, Of deepe desines, or else of clipping loues. Faire fall them all, that with wits industry, Doe cloath good subiects in true poesie. But as for me, my vexed thoughtfull soule, Takes pleasure, in displeasing sharp controule. Thou nursing Mother of faire wisedoms lore, Ingenuous Melancholy, I implore Thy graue assistance, take thy gloomie seate, Inthrone thee in my blood; Let me intreate Stay his quicke iocond skips, and force him runne A sadde pac'd course, vntill my whips be done. Daphne, vnclip thine armes from my sad brow, Blacke Cypresse crowne me whilst I vp do plow The hidden entrailes of ranke villanie. Tearing the vaile from damn'd Impietie. Quake guzzell dogs, that liue on putred slime, Skud from the lashes of my yerking rime. SATYRE. I. Fronti nulla fides. Marry God forfend, Martius swears he'le stab, Phrigeo, feare not, thou art no lying drab. What though dagger hack'd mouthes of his blade sweares It slew as many as figures of yeares Aqua fotis eate in't, or as many more, As methodist Musus, kild with Hellebore In autumne last, yet he beares the male lye With as smooth calme, as Mecho riualrie. How ill his shape, with inward forme doth fage, Like Aphrogenias ill-yok'd marriage. Fond Physiognomer, complexion Guides not the inward disposition, Inclines I yeeld. Thou saist Law Iulia, Or Catoes often curst Scatinia Can take no hold on simpring Lesbia, True, not on her eye, yet Allom oft doth blast, The sprouting bud that faine would longer last. Chary Casca, right pure or Rhodanus, Yet each night drinkes in glassie Priapus. Yon Pine is fayre, yet fouly doth it ill To his owne sprouts, marke, his rank drops distill Foule Naples canker in their tender rinde; Woe worth when trees drop in their proper kinde! Mystagogus, what meanes this prodegie? When Hiadolgo speakes gainst vsurie. When Verres railes gainst thieues. Mylo doth hate Murder, Clodius coockolds, Marius the gate Of squinting Ianus shuts? runne beyond bound of Nil vltra, and hang me when on's found Will be himselfe. Had Nature turn'd our eyes Into our proper selues, these curious spies Would be asham'd, Flauia would blush to flout When Oppia calls Lucina helpe her out. If she did thinke, Lynceus did know her ill, How Nature, Art, how Art, doth Nature spill. God pardon me, I often did auer Quod gratis, grate, the Astronomer An honest man, but I'le doe so no more, His face deceau'd me; but now since his whore And sister are all one, his honestie Shall be as bare as his Anatomie, To which hee bound his wife, Ã´ packstaffe rimes! Why not, when court of starrs shal see these crimes? Rodds are in pisse, I for thee Empericke, That twenty graines of Oppium wilt not sticke To minister to babes. Here's bloody dayes, When with plaine hearbes, Mutius more men slaies Then ere third Edwards sword. Sooth in our age, Mad Coribantes neede not to enrage The peoples mindes. You Ophiogine Of Hellespont, with wrangling villanie The swolne world's inly stung, then daine a touch, If that your fingers can effect so much. Thou sweet Arabian Panchaia, Perfume this nastie age, smugge Lesbia Hath stinking lunges, although a simpring grace, A muddy inside, though a surphul'd face. O for some deepe-searching Corycean, To ferret out yon lewd Cynedian. How now Brutus, what shape best pleaseth thee? All Protean formes, thy wife in venery At thy inforcement takes; well goe thy way, Shee may transforme thee ere thy dying day. Hush, Gracchus heares, that hath retaild more lyes, Broch'd more slaunders, done more villanies, Then Fabius perpetuall golden coate (Which might haue Semper idem for a mott) Hath beene at feasts, and led the measuring At Court, and in each marriage reueling. Writ PalÃ¦phatus, comment on those dreames, That Hylus takes, mid'st dung-pit reeking steames Of Athos hote house. Gramercie modest smyle. Chremes a sleepe. Paphia, sport the while. Lucia, new set thy ruffe, tut thou art pure, Canst thou not lispe, (good brother) look demure? Fye Gallus, what, a skeptick Pyrrhomist? When chast Dictinna, breakes the Zonelike twist? Tut, hang vp Hieroglyphickes. Ile not faine Wresting my humor, from his natiue straine. SATYRE. II. Difficile est Satyram non scribere. Iuve. I cannot hold, I cannot I indure To view a big womb'd foggie clowde immure The radiant tresses of the quickning sunne. Let Custards quake, my rage must freely runne. Preach not the Stoickes patience to me, I hate no man, but mens impietie. My soule is vext, what power will'th desist? Or dares to stop a sharpe fangd Satyrist? Who'le coole my rage? who'le stay my itching fist But I will plague and torture whom I list? If that the three-fold walls of Babilon Should hedge my tongue, yet I should raile vpon This fustie world, that now dare put in vre To make IEHOVA but a couerture, To shade ranck filth, loose conscience is free, From all conscience, what els hath libertie? As't please the Thracian Boreas to blow, So turnes our ayerie conscience, to, and fro. What icye Saturnist, what northerne pate But such grosse lewdnes would exasperate? I thinke the blind doth see, the flame God rise From Sisters couch, each morning to the skies: Glowing with lust. Walke but in duskie night, With Linceus eyes, and to thy piercing sight Disguised Gods will show, in pesants shape, Prest to commit some execrable rape. Here Ioues lust pander, Maias iugling sonne, In clownes disguise, doth after milk-maides runne. And fore he'le loose his brutish lechery, The truls shall tast sweet Nectars surquedry. There Iunos brat, forsakes Neries bed, And like a swaggerer, lust fiered, Attended onely with his smock sworne page, Pert Gallus, slilie slippes along, to wage Tilting incounters, with some spurious seede Of marrow pies, and yawning Oystars breede. O damn'd! Who would not shake a Satyres knottie rod? When to defile the sacred seate of God Is but accounted gentlemens disport? To snort in filth, each hower to resort To brothell pits: alas a veniall crime, Nay, royall, to be last in thirtith slime. Ay me, hard world for Satyrists beginne To sette vp shop, when no small petty sinne Is left vnpurg'd, once to be pursie fat Had wont be cause that life did macerate. Marry the iealous Queene of ayre doth frowne, That Ganimede is vp, and Hebe downe. Once Albion liu'd in such a cruell age That men did hold by seruile villenage. Poore brats were slaues, of bond-men that were borne, And marted, sold, but that rude law is torne, And disanuld, as too too inhumane, That Lords ore pesants should such seruice straine. But now, (sad change!) the kennell sinck of slaues, Pesant great Lords, and seruile seruice craues. Bondslaues sonnes had wont be bought &amp; sold, But now Heroes heires (if they haue not told A discreet number, fore theyr dad did die) Are made much of, how much from merchandie? Tail'd, and retail'd, till to the pedlers packe, The fourth-hand ward-ware comes, alack, alack, Would truth did know I lyde, but truth, and I, Doe know that fence is borne to miserie. Oh would to God, this were their worst mischance, Were not theyr soules sold to darke ignorance. Faire goodnes is foule ill if mischiefes wit Be not represt from lewd corrupting it. O what dry braine melts not sharp mustard rime To purge the snottery of our slimie time? Hence idle Cave, vengeance pricks me on, When mart is made of faire Religion, Reform'd bald Trebus swore in Romish quiere He sold Gods essence, for a poore denier. The Egyptians adored Onions, To Garlicke yeelding all deuotions. O happy Garlick, but thrice happy you, Whose senting gods, in your large gardens grew. Democritus, rise from thy putrid slime Sport at the madnes of that hotter clime. Deride their frenzie, that for policie Adore Wheate dough, as reall deitie. Almighty men, that can their Maker make, And force his sacred body to forsake The Cherubines, to be gnawne actually, Deuiding indiuiduum, really. Making a score of Gods with one poore word, I, so I thought, in that you could afford, So cheape a penny-worth. O ample fielde, In which a Satyre may iust weapon weelde. But I am vext, when swarmes of Iulians Are still manur'd by lewd Precisians. Who scorning Church rites, take the simbole vp As slouenly, as carelesse Courtiers slup Their mutton gruell. Fie, who can with-hold, But must of force make his milde Muse a scold? When that he greeued sees, with red vext eyes, That Athens antient large immunities, Are eye sores to the fates; Poore cells forlorne! Ist not enough you are made an abiect scorne To iering Apes, but must the shadow too Of auncient substance, be thus wrung from you? O split my hart, least it doe breake with rage To see th'immodest loosenes of our age. Immodest loosenes? fie too gentle word, When euery signe can brothelrie afford. When lust doth sparkle from our females eyes And modestie, is rousted in the skies. Tell me GalliottÃ¦, what meanes this signe When impropriat gentiles will turne Capuchine? Sooner be damn'd. O stuffe Satyricall? When rapine feedes our pomp, pomp ripes our fall. When the guest trembles at his hosts swart looke, The sonne, doth feare his stepdame, that hath tooke His mothers place for lust, the twin-borne brother Malinges his mate, that first came from his mother. When to be huge, is to be deadly sick, When vertuous pesants, will not spare to lick The deuils taile for poore promotion. When for neglect, slubbred Deuotion Is wan with greefe. When Rufus, yawnes for death Of him that gaue him vndeserued breath. When Hermus makes a worthy question, Whether of Wright, as Paraphonalion A siluer pispot fits his Lady dame? Or i'st too good? a pewter best became. When Agrippina poysons Claudius sonne, That all the world to her own brat might run. When the husband, gapes that his stale wife would die, That he might once be in by curtesie. The big paunch'd wife, longs for her loth'd mates death, That she might haue more ioyntures here on earth. When tenure for short yeeres, (by many a one) Is thought right good be turn'd forth Littleton, All to be headdie, or free hold at least When tis all one, for long life be a beast, A slaue, as haue a short term'd tenancie When dead's the strength of Englands yeomanrie, When invndation of luxuriousnes, Fatts all the world with such grosse beastlines. Who can abstaine? what modest braine can hold, But he must make his shamefac'd Muse a scold? SATYRE. III. Redde, age, quÃ¦ deinceps risisti. It's good be warie whilst the sunne shines cleere (Quoth that old chuffe that may dispend by yere Three thousand pound) whilst hee of good pretence Commits himselfe to Fleet to saue expence. No Countries Christmas: rather tarry heere, The Fleet is cheap, the Country hall too deere. But Codrus, harke, the world expects to see Thy bastard heire rotte there in misery. What? will Luxurio keepe so great a hall That he will proue a bastard in his fall? No, come on fiue, S. George, by heauen at all, Makes his catastrophe, right tragicall; At all, till nothing's left, Come on, till all comes off, I haire and all, Luxurio, left a scoffe To leaprous filthes: Ã´ stay, thou impious slaue, Teare not the lead from off thy Fathers graue, To stop base brokage, sell not thy fathers sheete, His leaden sheete, that strangers eyes may greete Both putrefaction of thy greedie Sire, And thy abhorred viperous desire. But wilt thou needes shall thy Dads lackie brat Weare thy Sires halfe-rot finger in his hat? Nay then Luxurio waste in obloquie, And I shall sport to heare thee faintly cry, A die, a drab, and filthy broking knaues, Are the worlds wide mouthes, all deuouring graues. Yet Samus keepes a right good house I heare; No, it keepes him, and free'th him from chill feare Of shaking fitts; How then shall his smug wench, How shall her bawd, (fit time) assist her quench Her sanguine heate? Linceus, canst thou sent? Shee hath her Monkey, &amp; her instrument Smooth fram'd at Vitrio. O greeuous misery! Luscus hath left his female luxurie. I, it left him; No, his old Cynick Dad Hath forc'd him cleane forsake his Pickhatch drab. Alack, alack, what peece of lustfull flesh Hath Luscus left, his Priape to redresse? Grieue not good soule, he hath his Ganimede, His perfum'd shee-goate, smooth kembd &amp; high fed. At Hogsdon now his monstrous lust he feasts, For there he keepes a baudy-house of beasts. Paphus, let Luscus haue his Curtezan, Or we shall haue a monster of a man. Tut, Paphus now detaines him from that bower, And claspes him close within his brick-built tower. Diogenes, th'art damn'd for thy lewd wit, For Luscus now hath skill to practise it. Fayth, what cares he for faire Cynedian boyes? Veluet cap'd Goates, duch Mares? tut common toies. Detaine them all, on this condition He may but vse the Cynick friction. O now yee male stewes, I can giue pretence For your luxurious incontinence. Hence, hence, yee falsed, seeming, Patriotes, Returne not with pretence of saluing spots, When here yee soyle vs with impuritie, And monstrous filth, of Doway seminary. What though Iberia yeeld you libertie, To snort in source of Sodom vilanie? What though the bloomes of young nobilitie, Committed to your Rodons custodie, Yee Nero like abuse? yet nere approch, Your newe S. Homers lewdnes heere to broch. Tainting our Townes, and hopefull Accademes, With your lust-bating most abhorred meanes. Valladolid, our Athens gins to tast Of thy ranck filth, Camphire and Lettuce chast, Are cleane casheird, now Sophi Ringoes eate, Candid Potatoes, are Athenians meate. Hence Holy-thistle, come sweet marrow pie, Inflame our backs to itching luxurie. A Crabs bak'd guts, a Lobsters buttered thigh, I heare them sweare is blood for venerie. Had I some snout faire brats, they should indure The new found Castilian callenture: Before some pedant-Tutor, in his bed Should vse my frie, like Phrigian Ganimede. Nay then chast cells, when greasie Aretine For his ranck Fico, is surnam'd diuine: Nay then come all yee veniall scapes to me, I dare well warrant you'le absolued be. Rufus, I'le terme thee but intemperate, I will not once thy vice exaggerate, Though that each howre thou lewdly swaggerest, And all the quarter day, pay'st interest For the forbearance of thy chalked score. Though that thou keep'st a tally with thy whore. Since Nero keepes his mother Agrippine, And no strange lust can satiate Messaline. Tullus goe scotfree, though thou often bragg'st That for a false French-crowne, thou vaulting hadst Though that thou know'st for thy incontinence Thy drab repay'd thee, true French pestilence. But tush, his boast I beare, when Tegeran Brags that he foystes his rotten Curtezan Vpon his heire, that must haue all his lands: And them hath ioyn'd in Hymens sacred bands. Ile wincke at Robrus, that for vicenage Enters commen, on his next neighbors stage, When Ioue maintaines his sister, and his whore: And she incestuous, iealous euermore, Least that Europa on the Bull should ride: Woe worth when beasts for filth are deified! Alacke poore rogues, what Censor interdicts The veniall scapes of him that purses picks? When some slie, golden-slopt Castilio Can cut a manors strings at Primero? Or with a pawne, shall giue a Lordship mate, In statute staple chaining fast his state? What Accademick starued Satyrist Would gnaw rez'd Bacon, or with inke black fist would tosse each muck-heap for som outcast scraps Of halfe-dung bones to stop his iawning chaps? Or with a hungry hollow halfe pin'd iaw Would once a thrice-turn'd bone-pick'd subiect gnaw When swarmes of Mountebancks, &amp; Bandeti Damn'd Briareans, sincks of villanie, Factors for lewdnes, brokers for the deuill, Infect our soules with all polluting euill. Shal Lucea scorne her husbands luke-warme bed? (Because her pleasure being hurried In ioulting Coach, with glassie instrument, Doth farre exceede the Paphian blandishment) Whilst I (like to some mute Pythagoran) Halter my hate, and cease to curse and ban Such brutish filth? Shall Matho raise his name, By printing pamphlets in anothers name, And in them praise himselfe, his wit, his might. All to be deem'd his Countries Lanthorne light? Whilst my tongue's ty'de with bonds of blushing shame For feare of broching my concealed name? Shall Balbus, the demure Athenian, Dreame of the death of next Vicarian? Cast his natiuitie? marke his complexion? Waigh well his bodies weake condition? That with guilt sleight he may be sure to get The Planets place, when his dim shine shall set? Shall Curio streake his lims on his dayes couch, In Sommer bower? and with bare groping touch Incense his lust, consuming all the yeere In Cyprian dalliance, and in Belgick cheere? Shall Faunus spend a hundred gallions, Of Goates pure milke, to laue his stallions, As much Rose iuyce? O bath! Ã´ royall, rich To scower Faunus, and his salt proude bitch! And when all's cleans'd, shall the slaues inside stinck worse then the new cast slime of Thames ebb'd brink? Whilst I securely let him ouerslip? Nere yerking him with my Satyrick whip? Shall Crispus with hipocrisie beguile, Holding a candle, to some fiend a while? Now Iew, then Turke, then seeming Christian, Then Athiest, Papist, and straight Puritan, Now nothing, any thing, euen what you list, So that some guilt may grease his greedy fist? Shall Damas vse his third-hand ward as ill, As any iade that tuggeth in the mill? What, shall law, nature, vertue, be reiected, Shall these world Arteries be soule infected, With corrupt blood? Whilst I shal Martia taske? Or some young Villius, all in choller aske, How he can keepe a lazie waiting man, And buy a hoode, &amp; siluer-handled fan With fortie pound? Or snarle at Lollios sonne? That with industrious paines hath harder wonne His true got worship, and his gentries name Then any Swine-heards brat, that lousie came To luskish Athens, and with farming pots, Compiling bedds, &amp; scouring greazie spots, By chaunce (when he can like taught Parrat cry Dearely belou'd, with simpering grauitie) Hath got the Farme of some gelt Vicary, And now on cock-horse, gallops iollilie Tickling with some stolne stuffe his sencelesse cure, Belching lewd termes gainst all sound littrature. Shall I with shaddowes fight? taske bitterly Romes filth? scraping base channell rogarie? Whilst such huge Gyants shall affright our eyes With execrable, damn'd impieties? Shall I finde trading Mecho, neuer loath Frankly to take a damning periur'd oath? Shall Furia broke her sisters modestie, And prostitute her soule to brothelrie? Shall Cossus make his well-fac'd wife a stale, To yeeld his braided ware a quicker sale? Shall cock-horse, fat-paunch'd Milo staine whole stocks Of well borne soules, with his adultering spots? Shall broking pandars sucke Nobilitie? Soyling fayre stems with foule impuritie? Nay, shall a trencher slaue extenuate, Some Lucrece rape? and straight magnificate Lewd Iouian lust? Whilst my satyrick vaine Shall muzled be, not daring out to straine His tearing paw? No gloomie Iuvenall, Though to thy fortunes I disastrous fall. SATYRE. IIII. CRAS. I marry Sir, here's perfect honestie: When Martius will forsweare all villanie: (All damn'd abuse, of payment in the warres All filching from his Prince, and Souldiers) When once he can but so much bright durt gleane, As may mainetaine, one more White-friers queane. One drab more, faith then farewell villanie, He'le cleanse himselfe to Shoreditch puritie. As for Stadius, I thinke he hath a soule, And if he were but free from sharpe controule Of his sower host, and from his Taylors bill, He would not thus abuse his riming skill, Iading our tyred eares with fooleries, Greasing great slaues, with oylie flatteries, Good fayth I thinke, he would not striue to sute The backe of humorous Time, (for base repute Mong dunghill pesants) botching vp such ware, As may be salable in Sturbridge fare. If he were once but freed from specialtie, But sooth, till then, beare with his ballatry. I ask'd lewd Gallus when he'le cease to sweare, And with whole culuering raging othes to teare The vault of heauen, spetting in the eyes Of natures Nature, lothsome blasphemies. To morrow he doth vow he will forbeare: Next day I meete him, but I heare him sweare Worse then before, I put his vow in minde, He aunswers me, to morrow, but I finde He sweares next day, farre worse then ere before: Putting me of with (morrow) euermore. Thus when I vrge him, with his sophistrie He thinkes to salue his damned periurie. Sylenus now is old, I wonder I He doth not hate his triple venery, Cold, writhled Eld, his liues-wet almost spent, Me thinkes a vnitie were compotent: But Ã´ fayre hopes! He whispers secretly, When it leaues him, he'le leaue his lecherie. When simpring Flaccus (that demurely goes Right neatly tripping on his new blackt toes) Hath made rich vse of his Religion, Of God himselfe, in pure deuotion: When that the strange Ideas in his head (Broch'd mong curious sotts, by shaddowes led) Hath furnish'd him, by his hote auditors Of fayre demeanes, and goodly rich mannors, Sooth then he will repent, when's treasurie Shall force him to disclaime his heresie. What will not poore need force? but being sped, God for vs all, the gurmonds paunch is fed. His minde is chang'd, but when will he doe good? To morrow, (I, to morrow by the rood.) Yet Ruscus sweares, he'le cease to broke a sute: By peasant meanes striuing to get repute Mong puffie Spunges, when the Fleet's defrayd His reuell tier, and his Laundresse payd. There is a crew which I too plaine could name If so I might without th'Aquinians blame, That lick the tayle of greatnes with their lips: Laboring with third-hand iests, and Apish skips, Retayling others wit, long barrelled To glib some great mans eares, till panch be fed, Glad if themselues, as sporting fooles be made, To get the shelter of some high-growne shade. To morrow yet these base tricks thei'le cast off, And cease for lucar be a iering scoffe. Ruscus will leaue, when once he can renue His wasted clothes, that are asham'd to view The worlds proude eyes. Drusus wil cease to fawne when that his Farme, that leakes in melting pawne Some Lord-applauded iest hath once set free. All will to morrow leaue their roguerie. When fox-furd Mecho (by damn'd vsurie, Cutthrote deceit, and his crafts villanie) Hath rak'd together some foure thousand pound, To make his smug gurle, beare a bumming sound In a young merchants eare, fayth then (may be) He'le ponder if there be a Deitie? Thinking, if to the parrish pouertie, At his wisht death, be dol'd a halfe-penny, A worke of Supererogation, A good filth-cleansing strong purgation. Aulus will leaue begging Monopolies, When that mong troupes of gaudie Butter-flies, He is but able iet it iollily, In pie-bauld sutes, of proude Court brauerie. To morrow doth Luxurio promise me, He will vnline himselfe from bitcherie. Marry Alcides thirteenth act must lend A glorious period, and his lust-itch end. When once he hath froth-foming Ãtna past At one and thirtie being alwayes last. If not to Day (quoth that Nasonian) Much lesse to morrow, Yes saith Fabian, For ingrain'd Habites, died with often dips, Are not so soone discoloured, young slips New set, are easily mou'd, and pluck'd away, But elder rootes, clip faster in the clay. I smile at thee, and at the Stagerite, Who holds the liking of the appetite, Beeing fedde with actions often put in vre Hatcheth the soule, in qualitie impure, Or pure. May be in vertue, but for vice, That comes by inspiration, with a trice Young Furius scarce fifteene yeres of age But is straight-wayes, right fit for marriage Vnto the deuill, for sure they would agree, Betwixt their soules there is such sympathie, O where's your sweatie habite, when each Ape, That can but spy the shadow of his shape, That can no sooner ken what's vertuous, But will auoyde it, and be vicious, Without much doe, or farre fetch'd habiture. In earnest thus, it is a sacred cure To salue the soules dread wounds; Omnipotent That Nature is, that cures the impotent, Euen in a moment; Sure Grace is infus'd By diuine fauour, not by actions vs'd. Which is as permanent as heauens blisse To them that haue it, then no habite is. To morrow, nay to day, it may be got: So please that gracious Power clense thy spot. Vice, from priuation of that sacred Grace, which God with-drawes, but puts not vice in place. Who sayes the sunne is cause of vgly night? Yet when he vailes our eyes from his faire sight, The gloomie curtaine of the night is spred. Yee curious sotts, vainly by Nature led, Where is your vice or vertuous habite now? For Sustine pro nunc doth bend his brow, And old crabb'd Scotus on th'organon Pay'th me with snaphaunce, quick distinction, Habites that intellectuall termed be, Are got, or els infus'd from Deitie. Dull Sorbonist, flie contradiction. Fye, thou oppugn'st the definition. If one should say, Of things term'd rationall, Some reason haue, others meere sensuall. Would not some freshman reading Porphirie, Hisse, and deride such blockish foolerie? Then vice nor vertue haue from habite place, The one from want, the other sacred grace. Infus'd, displac'd, not in our will or force, But as it please Iehoua haue remorce. I will, cryes Zeno, Ã´ presumption! I can, thou maist, dogged opinion Of thwarting Cynicks. To day vicious, List to their precepts, next day vertuous. Peace Seneca, thou belchest blasphemy. To liue from God, but to liue happily (I heare thee boast,) from thy Phylosophie, And from thy selfe, Ã´ rauing lunacie! Cynicks, yee wound your selues, for Destenie Ineuitable Fate, Necessitie, You hold doth sway the acts spirituall, As well as parts of that we mortall call, Where's then (I will?) wher's that strong Deitie, You doe ascribe to your Phylosophie? Confounded Natures brats, can will and Fate, Haue both theyr seate, &amp; office in your pate? O hidden depth of that dread Secrecie, Which I doe trembling touch in Poetrie! To day, to day, implore obsequiously, Trust not to morrowes will, least vtterly Yee be attach'd with sad confusion, In your Grace-tempting lewd presumption. But I forget; why sweat I out my braine, In deepe designes, to gay boyes lewd, and vaine? These notes were better sung, mong better sort, But to my pamphlet, few saue fooles resort. Libri primi, finis. SATY: Liber secundus. Proemium in librum secundum. I cannot quote a mott Italienate. Or brand my Satyres with som Spanish terme. I cannot with swolne lines magnificate, Mine owne poore worth, or as immaculate Task others rimes, as if no blot did staine, No blemish soile, my young Satyrick vaine. Nor can I make my soule a merchandize, Seeking conceits to sute these Artlesse times. Or daine for base reward to Poetize: Soothing the world, with oylie flatteries. Shall mercenary thoughts prouoke me write? Shall I for lucar be a Parasite? Shall I once pen for vulgar sorts applause? To please each hound? each dungie Scauenger? To fit some Oystar-wenches yawning iawes? With tricksey tales of speaking Cornish dawes? First let my braine (bright hair'd Latonas sonne) Be cleane distract with all confusion. What though some Iohn-Ã¡-stile will basely toile, Onely incited with the hope of gaine, Though roguie thoughts doe force some iade-like Moile Yet no such filth my true-borne Muse will soile. O Epictetus, I doe honour thee, To thinke how rich thou wert in pouertie. Ad Rithmum. Come prettie pleasing symphonie of words, Yee wel-match'd twins (whose like-tun'd tongs affords Such musicall delight,) come willingly And daunce Leuoltoes in my poesie. Come all as easie, as spruce Curio will, In some court hall to showe his capring skill. As willingly come meete &amp; iumpe together, As new ioyn'd loues, when they doe clip each other. As willingly, as wenches trip a round, About a May-pole, after bagpipes sound. Come riming numbers, come and grace conceite, Adding a pleasing close, with your deceit Inticing eares. Let not my ruder hand Seeme once to force you in my lines to stand, Be not so fearefull (pretty soules) to meete, As Flaccus is the Sergiants face to greete. Be not so backward loth to grace my sence, As Drusus is, to haue intelligence His Dad's aliue; but come into my head As iocondly, as when his wife was dead Young Lelius to his home. Come like-fac'd rime, In tunefull numbers keeping musicks time. But if you hange an arse, like Tubered, When Chremes dragg'd him from his brothell bed, Then hence base ballad stuffe, my poetrie Disclaimes you quite, for know my libertie Scornes riming lawes; Alas poore idle sound, Since I first PhÅbus knew, I neuer found Thy interest in sacred Poesie. Thou to Invention add'st but surquedry, A gaudie ornature, but hast no part, In that soule-pleasing high infused art. Then if thou wilt clip kindly in my lines, Welcome thou friendly ayde of my designes. If not? No title of my sence let change To wrest some forced rime, but freely range. Yee scrupulous obseruers, goe &amp; learne Of Ãsops dogge; meate from a shade discerne. SATYRE. V. Totum in toto. Hange thy selfe Drusus, hast nor arms nor brain? Some Sophy say, the gods sell all for paine, Not so. Had not that toyling Thebans steled back Dread poysned shafts, liu'd he now, he should lack. Spight of his farming Oxe-staules. Themis selfe Would be casheir'd from one poore scrap of pelfe. If that she were incarnate in our time Shee might lusk scorned in disdained slime, Shaded from honor by some enuious mist Of watry foggs, that fill the ill-stuft list Of faire Desert, ielous euen of blind darke, Least it should spie, and at their lamenes barke. Honors shade, thrusts honors substance from his place. Tis strange, when shade the substance can disgrace? Harsh lines cryes Curus, whose eares nere reioyce But at the quauering of my Ladies voyce. Rude limping lines fits this leud halting age, Sweet senting Curus, pardon then my rage, When wisards sweare plaine vertue neuer thriues, None but Priapus by plaine dealing wiues. Thou subtile Hermes, are the Destinies Enamor'd on thee? then vp mount the skies. Aduance, depose, doe euen what thou list, So long as Fates doe grace thy iugling fist. Tuscus, hast Beuclarkes armes and strong sinewes, Large reach, full fedde vaines, ample reuenewes? Then make thy markets by thy proper arme, O, brawnie strength is an all-canning charme! Thou dreadlesse Thracean, hast Hallirrhotius slaine? What? ist not possible thy cause maintaine Before the dozen Areopagites? Come Enagonian, furnish him with slights. Tut, Plutos wrath, Proserpina can melt, So that thy sacrifice be freely felt. What cannot Iuno force in bed with Ioue? Turne and returne a sentence with her loue. Thou art too duskie. Fie thou shallow Asse, Put on more eyes, and marke me as I passe. Well plainely thus, Sleight, Force, are mighty things, From which, much, (if not most) earths glory springs. If Vertues selfe, were clad in humane shape, Vertue without these, might goe beg and scrape. The naked truth is, a well clothed lie, A nimble quick-pate mounts to dignitie. By force, or fraude, that matters not a iot, So massie wealth may fall vnto thy lot. I heard old Albius sweare, Flavus should haue His eldest gurle, for Flavus was a knaue. A damn'd deep-reaching villaine, &amp; would mount He durst well warrant him to great account. What though he laid forth all his stock &amp; store Vpon some office, yet he'le gaine much more, Though purchast deere. Tut, he will trebble it In some fewe termes, by his extorting wit. When I in simple meaning went to sewe For tonge-tide Damus, that would needs go wooe, I praysd him for his vertue, honest life, By God, cryes Flora, Ile not be his wife. He'le nere come on. Now I sweare solemlie, When I goe next, I'le prayse his villanie. A better field to range in now a dayes, If vice be vertue, I can all men praise. What though pale Maurus paid huge symonies For his half-dozen gelded vicaries. Yet with good honest cut-throate vsurie, I feare he'le mount to reuerent dignitie. O sleight! all-canning sleight! all-damning sleight! The onely gally-ladder vnto might. Tuscus is trade falne, yet great hope he'le rise, For now he makes no count of periuries. Hath drawne false lights from pitch-black loueries, Glased his braided ware. Cogs, sweares, and lyes. Now since he hath the grace, thus gracelesse be His neighbors sweare, he'le swell with treasurie. Tut who maintaines, such goods ill got, decay. No, they'le stick by thy soule, they'le nere away. Luscus my Lords perfumer had no sale Vntill he made his wife a brothell stale. Absurd, the gods sell all for industrie? When, what's not got by hell-bred villanie? Codrus my well-fac'd Ladies taile-bearer, (He that some-times play'th Flauias vsherer) I heard one day complaine to Linceus, How vigilant, how right obsequious Modest in carriage, how true in trust, And yet (alas) nere guerdond with a crust. But now I see, he findes by his accounts That sole Priapus by plaine dealing mounts. How now? what droupes the new Pegasian Inne? I feare mine host is honest. Tut, beginne To set vp whore-house. Nere too late to thriue By any meanes at Porta Rich' ariue; Goe vse some sleight, or liue poore Irus life, Straight prostitute thy daughter, or thy wife, And soone be wealthy, but be damn'd with it, Hath not rich Mylo then deepe reaching wit? Faire age! When tis a high, and hard thing t'haue repute Of a compleat villaine, perfect, absolute, And roguing vertue brings a man defame. A packstaffe Epethite, and scorned name. Fie how my wit flaggs, how heauily Me thinks I vent dull sprightlesse poesie. What cold black frost congeales my nummed brain? What enuious power stops a Satyres vaine? O now I know, the iugling God of sleights, With Caduceus nimble Hermes fights, And mists my wits. Offended that my rimes Displaie his odious, world-abusing crimes. O be propitious, powerfull God of Arts, I sheathe my weapons and doe breake my darts, Be then appeas'd, I'le offer to thy shrine, An Heccatombe, of many spotted kine. Myriades of beastes shall satisfie thy rage, Which doe prophane thee in this Apish age. Infectious blood, yee goutie humors quake Whilst my sharp Razor doth incision make. SATYRE. VI. Hem nosti'n. Cvrio, know'st me? why thou bottle-ale, Thou barmy froth! O stay me, least I raile Beyond Nil vltra, to see this Butterflie, This windie bubble taske my balladry With sencelesse censure. Curio, know'st my spright? Yet deem'st that in sad seriousnes I write Such nastie stuffe as is Pigmalion? Such maggot-tainted lewd corruption? Ha, now he glauers with his fawning snowte, And swears, he thought, I meant but faintly flowte, My fine smug ryme. O barbarous dropsie noule! Think'st thou that Genius that attends my soule, And guides my fist to scourge Magnifico's Wil daigne my mind be ranck'd in Paphian showes? Think'st thou, that I, which was create to whip Incarnate fiends, will once vouchsafe to trip A Pauins trauerse? or will lispe (sweet loue) Or pule (Aye me) some female soule to moue? Think'st thou, that I in melting poesie Will pamper itching sensualitie? (That in the bodyes scumme all fatally Intombes the soules most sacred faculty.) Hence thou misiudging Censor, know I wrot Those idle rimes to note the odious spot And blemish that deformes the lineaments Of moderne Poesies habiliments. Oh that the beauties of Invention, For want of Iudgements disposition Should all be soyl'd, Ã´ that such treasurie, Such straines of well-conceited poesie, Should moulded be, in such a shapelesse forme, That want of Art, should make such wit a scorne. Here's one must invocate some lose-legg'd dame, Some brothell drab, to helpe him stanzaes frame, Or els (alas) his wits can haue no vent To broch conceits industrious intent. Another yet dares tremblingly come out, But first he must invoke good Colyn Clout. Yon's one hath yean'd a fearefull prodigie, Some monstrous mishapen Balladry, His guts are in his braines, huge Iobbernoule, Right Gurnets-head, the rest without all soule. Another walkes, is lazie, lyes him downe, Thinkes, reades, at length some wonted sleep doth crowne His new falne lids, dreames, straight tenne pound to one, Out steps some Fayery with quick motion, And tells him wonders, of some flowrie vale, Awakes straight, rubs his eyes, and prints his tale. Yon's one, whose straines haue flowne so high a pitch That straight he flags, &amp; tumbles in a ditch. His sprightly hote high-soring poesie Is like that dreamed of Imagerie, Whose head was gold, brest siluer, brassie thigh, Lead leggs, clay feete; Ã´ faire fram'd poesie. Here's one, to get an vndeseru'd repute Of deepe deepe learning, all in fustian sute Of ill-plac'd farre-fetch'd words attiereth His period, that all sence forsweareth. Another makes old Homer, Spencer cite Like my Pigmalion, where, with rare delight He cryes, O Ouid. This caus'd my idle quill, The worlds dull eares with such lewd stuffe to fill, And gull with bumbast lines, the witlesse sence Of these odde naggs; whose pates circumference Is fild with froth! O these same buzzing Gnats That sting my sleeping browes, these Nilus Rats, Halfe dung, that haue their life from putrid slime, These that doe praise my loose lasciuious rime: For these same shades I seriously protest I slubber'd vp that Chaos indigest, To fish for fooles, that stalke in goodly shape, What though in veluet cloake, yet still an Ape. Capro reads, sweares, scrubs, and sweares againe, Now by my soule an admirable straine, Strokes vp his haire, cryes passing passing good, Oh, there's a line incends his lustfull blood. Then Muto comes with his new glasse-set face, And with his late kist-hand my booke dooth grace, Straight reades, then smyles &amp; lisps (tis prety good) And praiseth that he neuer vnderstood. But roome for Flaccus, he'le my Satyres read. Oh how I trembled straight with inward dread! But when I saw him read my fustian, And heard him sweare I was a Pythian, Yet straight recald, &amp; sweares I did but quote Out of Xilinum to that margents note, I scarce could hold, &amp; keepe my selfe conceal'd, But had well-nigh my selfe and all reueal'd. Then straight comes Friscus, that neat gentleman, That newe discarded Academian, Who for he could cry (Ergo) in the schoole, Straight-way, with his huge iudgement dares controle What so'ere he viewes, that's prety, prety good, That Epethite hath not that sprightly blood Which should enforce it speake, that's Persius vaine, That's Iuvenals, heere's Horace crabbed straine, Though he nere read one line in Iuvenall, Or in his life his lazie eye let fall On duskie Persius. O indignitie To my respectlesse free-bred poesie. Hence ye big-buzzing-little-bodied Gnats, Yee tatling Ecchoes, huge tongu'd pigmy brats, I meane to sleepe, wake not my slumbring braine With your malignant weake detracting vaine. What though the sacred issue of my soule I heare expose to Ideots controule? What though I bare to lewd Opinion Lay ope to vulgar prophanation My very Genius. Yet know my poesie Doth scorne your vtmost, rank'st indignitie. My pate was great with child, &amp; here tis eas'd, Vexe all the world, so that thy selfe be pleas'd. SATYRE. VII. A Cynicke Satyre. A man, a man, a kingdome for a man. Why how now currish mad Athenian? Thou Cynick dogge, see'st not streets do swarme With troupes of men? No, no, for Circes charme Hath turn'd them all to swine: I neuer shall Thinke those same Samian sawes authenticall, But rather I dare sweare, the soules of swine Doe liue in men, for that same radiant shine, That lustre wherewith natures Nature decked Our intellectuall part, that glosse is soyled With stayning spots of vile impietie, And muddy durt of sensualitie, These are no men, but Apparitions, Ignes fatui, Glowormes, Fictions, Meteors, Ratts of Nilus, Fantasies, Colosses, Pictures, Shades, Resemblances. Ho Linceus! Seest thou yon gallant in the sumptuous clothes, How brisk, how spruce, how gorgiously he showes, Note his French-herring bones, but note no more, Vnlesse thou spy his fayre appendant whore That lackyes him. Marke nothing but his clothes, His new stampt complement, his Cannon oathes. Marke those, for naught but such lewd viciousnes Ere graced him, saue Sodom beastlines. Is this a Man? Nay, an incarnate deuill, That struts in vice, and glorieth in euill. A man, a man: peace Cynick, yon is one, A compleat soule, of all perfection. What? mean'st thou him that walks al open brested? Drawne through the eare with Ribands, plumy crested? He that doth snort in fat-fed luxury, And gapes for some grinding Monopoly? He that in effeminate inuention, In beastly source of all pollution, In ryot, lust, and fleshly seeming sweetnes, Sleepes sound secure, vnder the shade of greatnes? Mean'st thou that sencelesse, sensuall Epicure? That sinck of filth, that guzzell most impure? What he? Linceus on my word thus presume, He's nought but clothes, &amp; senting sweet perfume. His very soule, assure thee Linceus, Is not so big as is an Atomus: Nay, he is sprightlesse, sence or soule hath none, Since last Medusa turn'd him to a stone. A man, a man, Loe yonder I espie The shade of Nestor in sad grauitie; Since old Sylenus brake his Asses back, He now is forc'd his paunch, and gutts to pack In a fayre Tumbrell. Why sower Satirist Canst thou vnman him? Here I dare insist And soothly say, he is a perfect soule, Eates Nectar, drinks Ambrosia, saunce controule. An invndation of felicitie Fats him with honor, and huge treasurie. Canst thou not Linceus cast thy searching eye And spy his immynent Catastrophe? He's but a spunge, and shortly needs must leese His wrong got iuyce, when greatnes fist shal squeese His liquor out. Would not some shallow head, That is with seeming shadowes onely fed, Sweare yon same Damaske-coat, yon garded man, Were some graue sober Cato Vtican? When let him but in iudgements sight vncase, He's naught but budge, old gards, browne foxe-fur face. He hath no soule, the which the Stagerite Term'd rationall, for beastly appetite, Base dunghill thoughts, and sensuall action, Hath made him loose that faire creation. And now no man, since Circes magick charme Hath turn'd him to a maggot, that doth swarme In tainted flesh, whose foule corruption Is his fayre foode, whose generation Anothers ruine. O Canaans dread curse To liue in peoples sinnes. Nay farre more worse To muck ranke hate. But sirra, Linceus, Seest thou that troope that now affronteth vs? They are naught but Eeles, that neuer will appeare, Till that tempestuous winds or thunder teare Their slimie beds. But prithee stay a while, Looke, yon comes Iohn-Ã¡-noke and Iohn-a-stile, They'are naught but slow-pac'd, dilatory pleas, Demure demurrers, still striuing to appease Hote zealous loue. The language that they speake, Is the pure barbarous blacksaunt of the Geate, Their onely skill rests in Collusions, Abatements, stopples, inhibitions. Heauy-pac'd Iades, dull pated Iobernoules, Quick in delayes, checking with vaine controules Faire Iustice course, vile necessary euils, Smooth seeme-Saints, yet damn'd incarnate deuils. Farre be it from my sharpe Satirick Muse, Those graue, and reuerent legists to abuse, That ayde Astrea, that doe further right: But these Megera's that inflame despight, That broch deepe ranchor, that doe studie still To ruine right, that they their panch may fill With Irus blood; these Furies I doe meane, These Hedge-hogs, that disturbe Astreas Scean. A man, a man: peace Cynick, yon's a man, Behold yon sprightly dread Mauortian. With him I stop thy currish barking chops. what? meanst thou him, that in his swaggering slops Wallowes vnbraced all along the streete? He that salutes each gallant he doth meete, With farewell sweet Captaine, kind hart, adew. He that last night, tumbling thou didst view From out the great mans head, and thinking still He had beene Sentinell of warlike Brill, Cryes out Que va la? zownds Que? and out doth draw His transformd ponyard, to a Syrrenge straw, And stabs the Drawer. What that Ringo roote? Mean'st thou that wasted leg, puffe bumbast boote? What he that's drawne, and quartered with lace? That Westphalian gamon Cloue-stuck face? Why, he is naught but huge blaspheming othes, Swart snowt, big lookes, mishapen Swizers clothes, Weake meager lust hath now consumed quite, And wasted cleane away his martiall spright, Infeebling ryot, all vices confluence, Hath eaten out that sacred influence Which made him man. That diuine part is soak'd away in sinne, In sensuall lust, and midnight bezeling. Ranke invndation of luxuriousnes, Haue tainted him with such grosse beastlines, That now the seate of that celestiall essence Is all possest with Naples pestilence. Fat peace, and dissolute impietie, Haue lulled him in such securitie, That now, let whirlewinds and confusion teare The Center of our state, let Giants reare Hill vpon hill, let westerne Termagant Shake heauens vault, he with his Occupant, Are cling'd so close, like dew-wormes in the morne, That he'le not stir, till out his gutts are torne With eating filth. Tubrio snort on, snort on, Till thou art wak'd with sad confusion. Now raile no more at my sharpe Cynick sound Thou brutish world, that in all vilenes drown'd Hast lost thy soule, for naught but shades I see, Resemblances of men inhabite thee. Yon Tissue slop, yon Holy-crossed pane, Is but a water-spaniell that will faune And kisse the water whilst it pleasures him, But being once arriued at the brim, He shakes it off. Yon in the capring cloake, a Mimick Ape That onely striues to seeme an others shape. Yon's Ãsops Asse, yon sad ciuilitie, Is but an Oxe, that with base drugerie Eares vp the Land, whilst some gilt Asse doth chaw The golden wheat; he well apay'd with straw. Yons but a muckhill ouer-spred with snow, Which with that vaile doth euen as fairely show As the greene meades, whose natiue outward faire Breathes sweet perfumes into the neighbour ayre. Yon effeminate sanguine Ganimede, Is but a Beuer, hunted for the bed. Peace Cynick, see what yonder doth approach, A cart, a tumbrell? no a Badged coach. What's in't? some man. No, nor yet woman kinde, But a celestiall Angell, faire refinde. The deuill as soone. Her maske so hinders mee I cannot see her beauties deitie. Now that is off, shee is so vizarded, So steep'd in Lemons-iuyce, so surphuled I cannot see her face, vnder one hood Too faces, but I neuer vnderstood Or saw, one face vnder two hoods till now, Tis the right semblance of old Ianus brow. Her mask, her vizard, her loose-hanging gowne For her loose lying body, her bright spangled crown Her long slit sleeue, stiffe busk, puffe verdingall, Is all that makes her thus angelicall. Alas, her soule struts round about her neck, Her seate of sence is her rebato set, Her intellectuall is a fained nicenes Nothing but clothes, &amp; simpering precisenes. Out on these puppets, painted Images, Haberdashers shops, torch-light maskeries, Perfuming pans, Duch antients, Glowe wormes bright That soile our soules, and dampe our reasons light: Away, away, hence Coach-man, goe inshrine Thy new glas'd puppet in port Esqueline. Blush Martia, feare not, or looke pale, all's one, Margara keepes thy set complexion. Sure I nere thinke those axioms to be true, That soules of men, from that great soule ensue, And of his essence doe participate As't were by pypes, when so degenerate, So aduerse is our natures motion, To his immaculate condition: That such foule filth, from such faire puritie, Such sensuall acts from such a Deitie, Can nere proceed. But if that dreame were so, Then sure the slime that from our soules doe flow, Haue stopt those pipes by which it was conuai'd, And now no humane creatures, once disrai'd Of that fayre iem. Beasts sence, plants growth, like being as a stone, But out alas, our Cognisance is gone. Finis libri Secundi. SATY: Liber Tertius. Proemium in librum tertium. In serious iest, and iesting seriousnes I striue to scourge poluting beastlines. I invocate no Delian Deitie, Nor sacred of-spring of Mnemosyne: I pray in ayde of no Castalian Muse, No Nimph, no femall Angell to infuse A sprightly wit to raise my flagging wings, And teach me tune these harsh discordant strings: I craue no Syrens of our Halcion times, To grace the accents of my rough-hew'd rimes; But grim Reproofe, stearne Hate of villanie, Inspire and guide a Satyres poesie. Faire Detestation of foule odious sinne, In which our swinish times lye wallowing, Be thou my conduct and my Genius, My wits inciting sweet breath'd Zephirus. O that a Satyres hand had force to pluck Some fludgate vp, to purge the world from muck: Would God I could turne Alpheus riuer in To purge this Augean oxstaule from foule sin. Well, I will try, awake impuritie, And view the vaile drawne from thy villanie. SATYRE. VIII. Inamorato Curio. Cvrio, aye me! thy mistres Monkey's dead, Alas, alas, her pleasures buried. Goe womans slaue, performe his exequies, Condole his death in mournfull Elegies. Tut, rather Peans sing Hermaphrodite, For that sad death giues life to thy delight. Sweet fac'd Corinna, daine the riband tie Of thy Cork-shooe, or els thy slaue will die: Some puling Sonnet toles his passing bell, Some sighing Elegie must ring his knell, Vnlesse bright sunshine of thy grace reuiue His wambling stomack, certes he will diue Into the whirle-poole of deuouring death, And to some Mermaid sacrifice his breath. Then oh, oh then, to thy eternall shame, And to the honour of sweet Curios name, This Epitaph vpon the Marble stone, Must fayre be grau'd of that true louing one; Heere lyeth hee, hee lyeth heere, that bounc'd, and pitty cryed, The doore not op'd, fell sicke alas, alas fell sicke, and dyed. What Mirmidon, or hard Dolopian, What sauage minded rude Cyclopian, But such a sweet pathetique Paphian Would force to laughter? Ho Amphitrion, Thou art no Cuckold, what though Ioue dallied During thy warres, in faire Alckmenas bed, Yet Hercules true borne, that imbecilitie Of corrupt nature all apparantly Appeares in him, Ã´ foule indignitie, I heard him vow himselfe a slaue to Omphale, Puling (aye mee) Ã´ valours obloquie! Hee that the inmost nookes of hell did know, Whose nere craz'd prowesse all did ouer-throw, Lies streaking brawnie limmes in weakning bed, Perfum'd, smooth kemb'd, new glaz'd, faire surphuled, O that the boundlesse power of the soule Should be subiected to such base controule! Big limm'd Alcides, doffe thy honors crowne Goe spin huge slaue least Omphale should frowne. By my best hopes, I blush with greefe and shame To broach the peasant basenes of our name. O now my ruder hand begins to quake, To thinke what loftie Cedars I must shake: But if the canker fret the barkes of Oakes, Like humbler shrubs shal equall beare the stroakes Of my respectlesse rude Satyrick hand, Vnlesse the Destin's adamantine band Should tie my teeth, I cannot choose but bite To view Mauortius metamorphiz'd quite To puling sighes, &amp; into (aye me's) state, With voyce distinct, all fine articulate Lisping, Fayre saint, my woe compassionate, By heauen thine eye is my soule-guiding fate. The God of wounds, had wont on Cyprian couch To streake himselfe, and with incensing touch To faint his force onely when wrath had end: But now, mong furious garboiles, he doth spend His feebled valour, in tilt and turneing, With wet turn'd kisses, melting dallying. A poxe apon't, that Bacchis name should be The watch-word giuen to the soulderie. Goe troupe to fielde, mount thy obscured fame, Cry out S. George, invoke thy Mistres name; Thy Mistres, and S. George, alarum cry, Weake force, weake ayde that sprouts from luxurie. Thou tedious workmanship of lust-stung Ioue, Downe from thy skies, enioy our females loue, Some fiftie more Beotian gerles will sue To haue thy loue, (so that thy back be true.) O now me thinks I heare swart Martius cry Souping along in warrs fain'd maskerie, By Lais starrie front he'le forth-with die In cluttred blood, his Mistres liuorie. Her fancies colours waues vpon his head, O well fenc'd Albion, mainly manly sped, When those that are Soldadoes in thy state, Doe beare the badge of base, effeminate, Euen on their plumie crests, brutes sensuall, Hauing no sparke of intellectuall. Alack, what hope? when some ranck nasty wench Is subiect of their vowes and confidence? Publius hates vainely to idolatries, And laughs that Papists honor Images, And yet (Ã´ madnes) these mine eyes did see Him melt in mouing plaints, obsequiously Imploring fauour, twining his kind armes, Vsing inchauntments, exorcismes, charmes. The oyle of Sonnets, wanton blandishment, The force of teares, &amp; seeming languishment, Vnto the picture of a painted lasse: I saw him court his Mistres looking-glasse, Worship a busk-poynt, (which in secrecie I feare was conscius of strange villanie.) I saw him crouch, deuote his liuelihood, Sweare, protest, vow pesant seruitude Vnto a painted puppet, to her eyes I heard him sweare his sighes to sacrifice. But if he get her itch-allaying pinne, O sacred relique, straight he must beginne To raue out-right, then thus. Celestiall blisse, Can heauen grant so rich a grace as this? Touch it not (by the Lord Sir) tis diuine, It once beheld her radiant eyes bright shine: Her haire imbrac'd it, Ã´ thrice happie prick That there was thron'd, and in her haire didst sticke. Kisse, blesse, adore it Publius, neuer linne, Some sacred vertue lurketh in the pinne. O frantick fond pathetique passion! Ist possible such sensuall action Should clip the wings of contemplation? O can it be the spirits function, The soule not subiect to dimension, Should be made slaue to reprehension Of craftie natures paint? Fie, can our soule Be vnderling to such a vile controule? Saturio wish'd him selfe his Mistres buske, That he might sweetly lie, and softly luske Betweene her pappes, then must he haue an eye At eyther end, that freely might discry Both hills and dales. But out on Phrigio, That wish'd he were his Mistres dog, to goe And licke her milke-white fist, Ã´ prettie grace, That prettie Phrigio begs but Pretties place. Parthenophell, thy wish I will omit, So beastly tis I may not vtter it. But Punicus, of all I'le beare with thee, That faine would'st be thy Mistres smug Munkey, Here's one would be a flea, (iest comicall) Another his sweet Ladies verdingall To clip her tender breech; Another he Her siluer-handled fanne would gladly be, Here's one would be his Mistres neck-lace faine, To clip her faire, and kisse her azure vaine. Fond fooles, well wish'd, and pittie but should bee, For beastly shape to brutish soules agree. If Lauras painted lip doe daine a kisse To her enamor'd slaue, Ã´ heauens blisse (Straight he exclaimes) not to be match'd with this! Blaspheming dolt, goe three-score sonnets write Vpon a pictures kisse, Ã´ rauing spright! I am not saplesse, old, or rumatick, No Hipponax mishapen stigmatick, That I should thus inueigh gainst amorous spright Of him whose soule doth turne Hermaphrodite, But I doe sadly grieue, and inly vexe To view the base dishonors of our sexe. Tush, guiltles Doues, when Gods to force foule rapes, Will turne themselues to any brutish shapes. Base bastard powers, whom the world doth see Trans-form'd to swine for sensuall luxurie; The sonne of Saturne is become a Bull, To crop the beauties of some female trull. Now, when he hath his first wife Metim sped, And fairely chok'd, least foole gods should be bred Of that fond Mule. Themis his second wife Hath turn'd away, that his vnbrideled life Might haue more scope. Yet last his sisters loue Must satiate the lustfull thoughts of Ioue. Now doth the lecher in a Cuckowes shape Commit a monstrous and incestuous rape. Thrice sacred gods, and Ã´ thrice blessed skies Whose orbes includes such vertuous deities! What should I say? Lust hath confounded all, The bright glosse of our intellectuall Is fouly soyl'd. The wanton wallowing In fond delights, and amorous dallying, Hath dusk'd the fairest splendour of our soule: Nothing now left, but carkas, lothsome, foule. For sure, if that some spright remained still, Could it be subiect to lewd Lais will? Reason by prudence in her function Had wont to tutor all our action. Ayding with precepts of philosophy Our feebled natures imbecilitie: But now affection, will, concupiscence, Haue got o're Reason chiefe preheminence. Tis so, els how, how should such basenes taint As force it be made slaue to natures paint? Me thinkes the spirits Pegase Fantasie Should hoise the soule from such base slauery, But now I see, and can right plainly show From whence such abiect thoughts &amp; actions grow. Our aduerse body, beeing earthly, cold, Heauie, dull, mortall, would not long infold A stranger inmate, that was backward still To all his dungie, brutish, sensuall will: Now here-vpon our Intellectuall, Compact of fire all celestiall, Invisible, immortall, and diuine, Grewe straight to scorne his Land-lordes muddy slime. And therefore now is closely slunke away (Leauing his smoakie house of mortall clay) Adorn'd with all his beauties lineaments And brightest iemms of shining ornaments. His parts diuine, sacred, spirituall Attending on him, leauing the sensuall Base hangers on, lusking at home in slime, Such as wont to stop port Esqueline. Now doth the body ledde with sencelesse will, (The which in reasons absence ruleth still) Raue, talke idlie, as't were some deitie Adoring female painted puppetry Playing at put-pin, doting on some glasse (Which breath'd but on his falsed glosse doth passe) Toying with babies, and with fond pastime Some childrens sport, deflowring of chast time, Imploying all his wits in vaine expence, Abusing all his organons of sence. Returne, returne, sacred Synderesis, Inspire our truncks, let not such mud as this Pollute vs still. Awake our lethargie, Raise vs from out our brain-sicke foolerie. SATYRE. IX. Here's a toy to mocke an Ape indeede. Grim-fac'd Reproofe, sparkle with threatning eye Bend thy sower browes in my tart poesie. Auant yee curres, houle in some cloudie mist, Quake to behold a sharp-fang'd Satyrist. O how on tiptoes proudly mounts my Muse, Stalking a loftier gate then Satyres vse. Me thinkes some sacred rage warmes all my vaines, Making my spright mount vp to higher straines Then wel beseemes a rough-tongu'd Satyres part, But Art curbs Nature, Nature guildeth Art. Come downe yee Apes, or I will strip you quite, Baring your bald tayles to the peoples sight. Yee Mimick slaues, what are you percht so high? Downe Iack an Apes from thy fain'd roialtie. What furr'd with beard, cas'd in a Satin sute Iudiciall Iack? how hast thou got repute Of a sound censure? O ideot times, When gawdy Monkeyes mowe ore sprightly rimes! O world of fooles, when all mens iudgement's set And rests vpon some mumping Marmuset! Yon Athens Ape (that can but simperingly Yaule auditores humanissimi, Bound to some seruile imitation, Can with much sweat patch an Oration,) Now vp he comes, and with his crooked eye Presumes to squint on some faire Poesie; And all as thanklesse as vngratefull Thames He slinkes away, leauing but reeching steames Of dungie slime behind, all as ingrate He vseth it, as when I satiate My spaniels paunch, who straight perfumes the roome, With his tailes filth: so this vnciuill groome, Ill-tutor'd pedant, Mortimers numbers With muck-pit esculine filth bescumbers. Now th'Ape chatters, and is as malecontent As a bill-patch'd doore, whose entrailes out haue sent And spewd theyr tenant. My soule adores iudiciall schollership, But when to seruile imitatorship Some spruce Athenian pen is prentized, Tis worse then Apish. Fie, bee not flattered With seeming worth, fond affectation Befits an Ape, and mumping Babilon. O what a tricksie lerned nicking straine Is this applauded, sencles, modern vain! When late I heard it from sage Mutius lips How il me thought such wanton Iigging skips Beseem'd his grauer speech. Farre flie thy fame Most, most, of me belou'd, whose silent name One letter bounds. Thy true iudiciall stile I euer honour, and if my loue beguile Not much my hopes, then thy vnvalued worth Shall mount faire place, when Apes are turned forth. I am too milde, reach me my scourge againe, O yon's a pen speakes in a learned vaine. Deepe, past all sence. Lanthorne &amp; candle light, Here's all invisible, all mentall spright. What hotchpotch, giberidge, doth the Poet bring? How strangely speakes? yet sweetly doth he sing. I once did know a tinckling Pewterer, That was the vildest stumbling stutterer That euer hack'd and hew'd our natiue tongue, Yet to the Lute if you had heard him sung, Iesu how sweet he breath'd. You can apply. O sencelesse prose, iudiciall poesie, How ill you'r link'd. This affectation, To speake beyond mens apprehension, How Apish tis. When all in fusten sute Is cloth'd a huge nothing, all for repute Of profound knowledge, when profoundnes knowes There's nought containd, but only seeming showes. Old Iack of Parris-garden, canst thou get A faire rich sute, though fouly runne in debt? Looke smug, smell sweet, take vp commodities, Keepe whores, fee baudes, belch impious blasphemies, Wallow along in swaggering disguise, Snuffe vp smoak whiffs, &amp; each morne fore she rise Visite thy drab? Canst vse a false cut Die With a cleane grace, and glib facilitie? Canst thunder cannon oathes, like th'ratling Of a huge, double, full-charg'd culuering? Then Iack troupe mong our gallants, kisse thy fist, And call them brothers. Say a Satyrist Sweares they are thine in neere affinitie. All coosin germaines, saue in villanie. For (sadly truth to say) what are they els But imitators of lewd beastlines? Farre worse then Apes; for mow, or scratch your pate, It may be some odde Ape will imitate. But let a youth that hath abus'd his time, In wronged trauaile, in that hoter clime, Swoope by old Iack, in clothes Italienate: And I'le be hang'd if he will imitate His strange fantastique sute shapes.â Or let him bring or'e beastly luxuries, Some hell-deuised lustfull villanies, Euen Apes &amp; beasts would blush with natiue shame, And thinke it foule dishonour to their name, Their beastly name, to imitate such sin As our lewd youths doe boast and glory in. Fie, whether doe these Monkeys carry mee? Their very names doe soile my poesie. Thou world of Marmosets and mumping Apes, Vnmaske, put of thy fained borrowed shapes. Why lookes neate Curus all so simperingly? Why babbles thou of deepe Diuinitie? And of that sacred testimoniall? Liuing voluptuous like a Bacchanall? Good hath thy tongue: but thou ranke Puritan, I'le make an Ape as good a Christian. I'le force him chatter, turning vp his eye Looke sad, goe graue. Demure ciuilitie Shall seeme to say, Good brother, sister deere, As for the rest, to snort in belly cheere, To bite, to gnaw, and boldly intermell With sacred things, in which thou doost excell, Vnforc'd he'le doe. O take compassion Euen on your soules, make not religion A bawde to lewdnes. Ciuill Socrates, Clip not the youth of Alcebiades With vnchast armes. Disguised Messaline, I'le teare thy maske, and bare thee to the eyne Of hissing boyes, if to the Theaters I finde thee once more come for lecherers To satiate? Nay, to tyer thee with the vse Of weakning lust. Yee fainers, leaue t'abuse Our better thoughts with your hipocrisie, Or by the euer-liuing Veritie, I'le stryp you nak'd, and whyp you with my rimes, Causing your shame to liue to after times. [SATIRE X] SATYRA NOVA. Stultorum plena sunt omnia. To his very friend, maister E.G. From out the sadnes of my discontent, Hating my wonted iocund merriment, (Onely to giue dull Time a swifter wing) Thus scorning scorne of Ideot fooles, I sing. I dread no bending of an angry brow, Or rage of fooles that I shall purchase now. Who'le scorne to sitte in ranke of foolery When I'le be maister of the company? For pre-thee Ned, I pre-thee gentle lad, Is not he frantique, foolish, bedlam mad, That wastes his spright, that melts his very braine In deepe designes, in wits darke gloomie straine? That scourgeth great slaues with a dreadlesse fist, Playing the rough part of a Satyrist, To be perus'd by all the dung-scum rable Of thin-braind Ideots, dull, vncapable? For mimicke apish schollers, pedants, gulls, Perfum'd Inamoratoes, brothell trulls? Whilst I (poore soule) abuse chast virgin Time, Deflowring her with vnconceiued rime. Tut, tut, a toy of an idle empty braine, Some scurrill iests, light gew-gawes, fruitlesse, vaine. Cryes beard-graue Dromus, when alas, God knowes, His toothles gums nere chaw but outward showes. Poore Budgeface, bowcase sleeue, but let him passe, Once fur and beard shall priuiledge an Asse. And tell me Ned, what might that gallant be, Who to obtaine intemperate luxurie, Cuckolds his elder brother, gets an heire, By which his hope is turned to dispaire? In fayth, (good Ned) he damn'd himselfe with cost, For well thou know'st full goodly land was lost. I am too priuate. Yet mee thinkes an Asse, Rimes well with VIDERIT VTILITAS. Euen full as well, I boldly dare auer As any of that stinking Scauenger Which from his dunghill hee bedaubed on The latter page of old Pigmalion. O that thys brother of hypocresie, (Applauded by his pure fraternitie) Should thus be puffed, and so proud insist, As play on mee the Epigramatist. Opinion mounts this froth vnto the skies, Whom iudgements reason iustly vilefies. For, (shame to the Poet,) reade Ned, behold How wittily a Maisters-hoode can scold. An Epigram which the Authour Vergidemiarum, caused to bee pasted to the latter page of euery Pigmalion that came to the stacioners of Cambridge. I ask'd Phisitions what theyr counsell was For a mad dogge, or for a mankind Asse? They told mee though there were confections store, Of Poppy-seede, and soueraine Hellebore, The dog was best cured by cutting &amp; Mark the witty allusion to my name. kinsing, The Asse must be kindly whipped for winsing. Nowe then S.K. I little passe Whether thou be a mad dog, or a mankind Asse. Medice cura teipsum.Smart ierke of wit, did euer such a straine Rise from an Apish schoole-boyes childish braine? Doost thou not blush (good) Ned, that such a sent Should rise from thence where thou hadst nutriment? Shame to Opinion, that perfumes his dung, And streweth flowers rotten bones among, Iugling Opinion, thou inchaunting witch, Paint not a rotten post with colours rich. But now this Iugler with the worlds consent Hath halfe his soule; the other, Compliment, Mad world the whilst. But I forget mee I, I am seduced with this poesie: And madder then a Bedlam spend sweet time In bitter numbers, in this idle rime, Out on this humour. From a sickly bed, And from a moodie minde distempered, I vomit foorth my loue, now turn'd to hate, Scorning the honour of a Poets state. Nor shall the kennell route of muddy braines, Rauish my Muses heyre, or heare my straines Once more. No nittie pedant shall correct Ãnigmaes to his shallow Intelect. Inchauntment, Ned hath rauished my sence In a Poetick vaine circumference. Yet thus I hope, (God shield I now should lie) Many more fooles, and most more wise then I. VALE. [SATIRE XI] Humours. Sleep grim Reproofe, my iocond Muse dooth sing In other keyes, to nimbler fingering. Dull sprighted Melancholy, leaue my braine To hell Cimerian night, in liuely vaine I striue to paint, then hence all darke intent And sullen frownes, come sporting meriment, Cheeke dimpling laughter, crowne my very soule With iouisance, whilst mirthfull iests controule The goutie humours of these pride-swolne dayes, Which I doe long vntill my pen displaies. O I am great with mirth, some midwifrie, Or I shall breake my sides at vanitie. Roome for a capering mouth, whose lips nere stur, But in discoursing of the gracefull slur: Who euer heard spruce skipping Curio Ere prate of ought, but of the whirle on toe. The turne aboue ground, Robrus sprauling kicks, Fabius caper, Harries tossing tricks? Did euer any eare, ere heare him speake Vnlesse his tongue of crosse-poynts did intreat? His teeth doe caper whilst he eates his meate, His heeles doe caper, whilst he takes his seate, His very soule, his intellectuall Is nothing but a mincing capreall. He dreames of toe-turnes, each gallant hee doth meete He fronts him with a trauers in the streete, Prayse but Orchestra, and the skipping art, You shall commaund him, faith you haue his hart Euen capring in your fist. A hall, a hall, Roome for the Spheres, the Orbes celestiall Will daunce Kemps Iigge. They'le reuel with neate iumps A worthy Poet hath put on their Pumps? O wits quick trauers, but sance ceo's slow, Good faith tis hard for nimble Curio. Yee gracious Orbs, keepe the old measuring, All's spoyld if once yee fall to capering. Luscus what's playd to day? faith now I know I set thy lips abroach, from whence doth flow Naught but pure Iuliat and Romio. Say, who acts best? Drusus, or Roscio? Now I haue him, that nere of ought did speake But when of playes or Plaiers he did treate. H'ath made a common-place booke out of plaies, And speakes in print, at least what ere he sayes Is warranted by Curtaine plaudeties, If ere you heard him courting Lesbias eyes; Say (Curteous Sir) speakes he not mouingly From out some new pathetique Tragedie? He writes, he railes, he iests, he courts, what not, And all from out his huge long scraped stock Of well penn'd playes. Oh come not within distance, Martius speakes, Who nere discourseth but of fencing feates, Of counter times, finctures, slye passataes, Stramazones, resolute Stoccataes, Of the quick change, with wiping mandritta, The carricado, with th'enbrocata, Oh, by Iesu Sir, (me thinks I heare him cry) The honourable fencing mistery, Who doth not honor? Then fals he in againe, Iading our eares, and some-what must be saine Of blades, and Rapier-hilts, of surest garde, Of Vincentio, and the Burgonians ward. This bumbast foile-button I once did see By chaunce, in Liuias modest companie, When after the God-sauing ceremonie, For want of talke-stuffe, falls to foinerie, Out goes his Rapier, and to Liuia He showes the ward by puncta reuersa. The incarnata. Nay, by the blessed light, Before he goes, he'le teach her how to fight And hold her weapon. Oh I laught amaine, To see the madnes of this Martius vaine. But roome for Tuscus, that iest-mounging youth, Who nere did ope his Apish gerning mouth But to retaile and broke anothers wit. Discourse of what you will, he straight can fit Your present talke, with, Sir, I'le tell a iest, (Of some sweet Lady, or graund Lord at least) Then on he goes. And nere his tongue shall lye Till his ingrossed iests are all drawne dry; But then as dumbe as Maurus, when at play H'ath lost his crownes, and paun'd his trim array. He doth naught but retaile iests, breake but one Out flies his table-booke, let him alone, He'le haue't i-fayth; Lad, hast an Epigram, Wilt haue it put into the chaps of Fame? Giue Tuscus coppies, sooth as his owne wit His propper issue he will father it. O that this Eccho, that doth speake, spet, write Naught but the excrements of others spright, This ill-stuft truncke of iests, whose very soule Is but a heape of Iibes, should once inroule His name mong creatures termed rationall, whose cheefe repute, whose sence, whose soule &amp; al Are fedde with offall scrapes, that sometimes fal From liberall wits, in their large festiuall. Come a loft Iack, roome for a vaulting skip, Roome for Torquatus, that nere op'd his lip But in prate of pummado reuersa, Of the nimble tumbling Angelica. Now on my soule, his very intelect Is naught but a curuetting Sommerset. Hush, hush, cryes (honest Phylo) peace, desist, Doost thou not tremble sower Satyrist Now iudiciall Musus readeth thee? He'le whip each line, he'le scourge thy balladry, Good fayth he will. Phylo I prethee stay Whilst I the humour of this dogge display: He's naught but censure, wilt thou credite me, He neuer wrote one line in poesie, But once at Athens in a theame did frame A paradox in prayse of Vertues name, Which still he huggs, and lulls as tenderly As cuckold Tisus his wifes bastardie. Well, here's a challenge, I flatly say he lyes That heard him ought but censure Poesies. Tis his discourse, first hauing knit the brow, Stroke vp his fore-top, champing euery row, Belcheth his slauering censure on each booke That dare presume euen on Medusa looke. I haue no Artists skill in simphonies, Yet when some pleasing Diapason flies From out the belly of a sweet touch'd Lute, My eares dares say tis good, or when they sute Some harsher seauens for varietie, My natiue skill discernes it presently. What then? Will any sottish dolt repute Or euer thinke me Orpheus absolute? Shall all the world of Fidlers follow me, Relying on my voyce in musickrie? Musus here's Rhodes, let's see thy boasted leape, Or els avaunt lewd curre, presume not speake, Or with thy venome-sputtering chapps to barke Gainst well-pend Poems, in the tongue-tied darke. O for a humour, looke who yon doth goe, The meager lecher, lewd Luxurio, Tis he that hath the sole monopolie By patent, of the Suburbe lecherie. No new edition of drabbs comes out, But seene and allow'd by Luxurios snout. Did euer any man ere heare him talke But of Pick-hatch, or of some Shorditch baulke, Aretines filth, or of his wandring whore, Of some Cynedian, or of Tacedore, Of Ruscus nastie lothsome brothell rime, That stincks like Aiax froth, or muck-pit slime. The newes he tells you, is of some new flesh, Lately broke vp, spanne new, hote piping fresh; The curtesie he showes you, is some morne To giue you Venus fore her smock be on. His eyes, his tongue, his soule, his all is lust, Which vengeance and confusion follow must. Out on this salt humour, letchers dropsie, Fie, it doth soyle my chaster poesie. O spruce! How now Piso, Aurelius Ape, What strange disguise, what new deformed shape Doth hold thy thoughts in contemplation? Faith say, what fashion art thou thinking on? A stitch'd Taffata cloake, a payre of slops Of Spanish leather? O who heard his chops Ere chew of ought, but of some strange disguise. This fashion-mounger, each morne fore he rise Contemplates sute shapes, &amp; once from out his bed, He hath them straight full liuely portraied. And then he chukes, and is as proud of this, As Taphus when he got his neighbours blisse. All fashions since the first yeare of this Queene, May in his studdie fairely drawne be seene, And all that shall be to his day of doome, You may peruse within that little roome. For not a fashion once dare show his face, But from neate Pyso first must take his grace. The long fooles coat, the huge slop, the lugg'd boot From mimick Piso, all doe claime their roote. O that the boundlesse power of the soule Should be coop'd vp in fashioning some roule! But Ã´, Suffenus, (that dooth hugge, imbrace His propper selfe, admires his owne sweet face, Prayseth his owne faire limmes proportion, Kisseth his shade, recounteth all alone His owne good parts) who enuies him? not I, For well he may, without all riualrie. Fie, whether's fledde my sprights alacritie? How dull I vent this humorous poesie. In fayth I am sad, I am possest with ruth, To see the vainenes of fayre Albions youth; To see their richest time euen wholy spent In that which is but Gentries ornament. Which beeing meanely done, becomes them well, But when with deere times losse they doe excell, How ill they doe things well. To daunce &amp; sing, To vault, to fence, &amp; fairely trot a ring With good grace, meanely done. O what repute They doe beget, but beeing absolute, It argues too much time, too much regard Imploy'd in that which might be better spard, Then substance should be lost. If one should sew For Lesbias loue, hauing two dayes to woe And not one more, &amp; should imploy those twaine The fauour of her wayting-wench to gaine, Were he not mad? Your apprehension, Your wits are quicke in application. Gallants, Me thinks your soules should grudge, &amp; inly scorne To be made slaue, to humors that are borne In slime of filthy sensualitie. That part not subiect to mortalitie (Boundlesse discursiue apprehension Giuing it wings to act his function) Me thinks should murmure, when you stop his course, And soile his beauties in some beastly source, Of brutish pleasures. But it is so poore, So weake, so hunger bitten, euermore Kept from his foode, meagar for want of meate, Scorn'd and reiected, thrust from out his seate, Vpbray'd by Capons greace, consumed quite By eating stewes, that waste the better spright. Snib'd by his baser parts, that now poore Soule, (Thus pesanted to each lewd thoughts controule) Hath lost all hart, bearing all iniuries, The vtmost spight, and rank'st indignities With forced willingnes. Taking great ioy If you will daine his faculties imploy But in the mean'st ingenious qualitie. (How proude he'le be of any dignitie?) Put it to musick, dauncing, fencing schoole, Lord how I laugh to heare the pretty foole How it will prate, his tongue shall neuer lie, But still discourse of his spruce qualitie; Egging his maister to proceed from this, And get the substance of celestiall blisse. His Lord straight calls his parliament of sence, But still the sensuall haue preheminence. The poore soules better part so feeble is, So cold and dead is his Synderisis, That shadowes by odde chaunce somtimes are got, But Ã´ the substance is respected not. Here ends my rage, though angry brow was bent, Yet I haue sung in sporting merriment. FINIS. To euerlasting Obliuion. Thou mighty gulfe, insatiat cormorant, Deride me not, though I seeme petulant To fall into thy chops. Let others pray For euer their faire Poems flourish may. But as for mee, hungry Obliuion Deuoure me quick, accept my orizon: My earnest prayers, which doe importune thee, With gloomie shade of thy still Emperie, To vaile both me and my rude poesie. Farre worthier lines in silence of thy state Doe sleepe securely free from loue or hate, From which this liuing, nere can be exempt, But whilst it breathes will hate and furie tempt. Then close his eyes with thy all-dimming hand, Which not right glorious actions can with-stand. Peace hatefull tongues, I now in silence pace, Vnlesse some hound doe wake me from my place, I with this sharpe, yet well meant poesie, Will sleepe secure, right free from iniurie Of cancred hate, or rankest villanie. POEMS FROM LOVE'S MARTYR A narration and description of a most exact wondrous creature, arising out of the PhÅnix and Turtle Doues ashes. O twas a mouing Epicedium! Can Fire? can Time? can blackest Fate consume So rare creation? No; tis thwart to sence, Corruption quakes to touch such excellence, Nature exclaimes for Iustice, Iustice Fate, Ought into nought can neuer remigrate. Then looke; for see what glorious issue (brighter Then clearest fire, and beyond faith farre whiter Then Dians tier) now springs from yonder flame? Let me stand numb'd with wonder, neuer came So strong amazement on astonish'd eie As this, this measurelesse pure Raritie. Lo now; th'xtracture of deuinest Essence, The Soule of heauens labour'd Quintessence, (Peans to PhÅbus) from deare Louer's death, Takes sweete creation and all blessing breath. What strangenesse is't that from the Turtles ashes Assumes such forme? (whose splendor clearer flashes, Then mounted Delius) tell me genuine Muse. Now yeeld your aides, you spirites that infuse A sacred rapture, light my weaker eie: Raise my inuention on swift Phantasie, That whilst of this same Metaphisicall God, Man, nor Woman, but elix'd of all My labouring thoughts, with strained ardor sing, My Muse may mount with an vncommon wing. The description of this Perfection. Dares then thy too audacious sense Presume, define that boundlesse Ens, That amplest thought transcendeth? O yet vouchsafe my Muse, to greete That wondrous rarenesse, in whose sweete All praise begins and endeth. Diuinest Beautie? that was slightest, That adorn'd this wondrous Brightest, Which had nought to be corrupted. In this, Perfection had no meane To this, Earths purest was vncleane Which virtue euen instructed. By it all Beings deck'd and stained, Ideas that are idly fained Onely here subsist inuested. Dread not to giue strain'd praise at all, No speech is Hyperbolicall, To this perfection blessed. Thus close my Rimes, this all that can be sayd, This wonder neuer can be flattered. To Perfection. A Sonnet. Oft haue I gazed with astonish'd eye, At monstrous issues of ill shaped birth, When I haue seene the Midwife to old earth, Nature produce most strange deformitie. So haue I marueld to obserue of late, Hard fauour'd Feminines so scant of faire, That Maskes so choicely, sheltred of the aire, As if their beauties were not theirs by fate. But who so weake of obseruation, Hath not discern'd long since how vertues wanted, How parcimoniously the heauens haue scanted, Our chiefest part of adornation? But now I cease to wonder, now I find The cause of all our monstrous penny-showes: Now I conceit from whence wits scarc'tie growes, Hard fauord features, and defects of mind. Nature long time hath stor'd vp vertue, fairenesse, Shaping the rest as foiles vnto this Rarenesse. Perfectioni Hymnus. What should I call this creature, Which now is growne vnto maturitie? How should I blase this feature As firme and constant as Eternitie? Call it Perfection? Fie! Tis perfecter then brightest names can light it: Call it Heauens mirror? I. Alas, best attributes can neuer right it. Beauties resistlesse thunder? All nomination is too straight of sence: Deepe Contemplations wonder? That appellation giue this excellence. Within all best confin'd, (Now feebler Genius end thy slighter riming) No Suburbes all is Mind As farre from spot, as possible defining. Iohn Marston. On Jonson's Sejanus, 1605 Amicis, amici nostri dignissimi, dignissimis, Epigramma. D. Johannes Marstonivs. Yee ready Friendes, spare your vnneedfull Bayes, This worke dispairefull Enuie must euen praise: PhÅbus hath voic'd it, loud, through ecchoing skies, Seianvs Fall shall force thy Merit rise. For neuer English shall, or hath before Spoake fuller grac'd. He could say much, not more.
