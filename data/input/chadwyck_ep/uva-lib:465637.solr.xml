      <field name="fulltext">VOL. IV. THE PSALMS OF DAVID, IMITATED IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE NEW TESTAMENT, AND APPLIED TO THE CHRISTIAN STATE AND WORSHIP. ALL THINGS MUST BE FULFILLED WHICH WERE WRITTEN IN—THE PSALMS CONCERNING ME. LUKE xxiv. 44. DAVID, SAMUEL, AND THE PROPHETS—THAT THEY WITHOUT US SHOULD NOT BE MADE PERFECT. HEB. xi. 32, 40. PSALM 1. (C. M.) The Way and End of the Righteous and the Wicked. I Blest is the man who shuns the place Where sinners love to meet; Who fears to tread their wicked ways, And hates the scoffer's seat: II But in the statutes of the Lord Has plac'd his chief delight; By day he reads or hears the word, And meditates by night. III He like a plant of generous kind, By living waters set, Safe from the storms and blasting wind, Enjoys a peaceful state. IV Green as the leaf and ever fair Shall his profession shine, While fruits of holiness appear Like clusters on the vine. V Not so the impious and unjust; What vain designs they form! Their hopes are blown away like dust, Or chaff before the storm. VI Sinners in judgment shall not stand He shall set the sheep at his right hand, &amp;c. Matt. xxv. 33. Amongst the sons of grace, When Christ the Judge, at his right hand Appoints his saints a place. VII His eye beholds the path they tread, His heart approves it well; But crooked ways of sinners lead Down to the gates of hell. In this work I have often borrowed a line or two from the New Testament; that the excellent and inspired composures of the jewish psalmist may be brightened by the clearer discoveries of the gospel. PSALM 1. (S. M.) The Saint happy, the Sinner miserable. I The man is ever blest Who shuns the sinners' ways, Among their counsels never stands, Nor takes the scorners' place; II But makes the law of God His study and delight, Amidst the labours of the day, And watches of the night. III He like a tree shall thrive, With waters near the root; Fresh as the leaf his name shall live, His works are heavenly fruit. IV Not so th'ungodly race, They no such blessings find; Their hopes shall flee like empty chaff Before the driving wind. V How will they bear to stand Before that judgment seat, Where all the saints at Christ's right hand In full assembly meet? VI He knows, and he approves The way the righteous go; But sinners and their works shall meet A dreadful overthrow. PSALM 1. (L. M.) The Difference between the Righteous and the Wicked. I Happy the man whose cautious feet Shun the broad way that sinners go, Broad is the way that leads to destruction, Matt. vii. 13, 14. Who hates the place where Atheists meet, And fears to talk as scoffers do. II He loves t'employ his morning light Amongst the statutes of the Lord; And spends the wakeful hours of night With pleasure pondering o'er the word. III He, like a plant by gentle streams, Shall flourish in immortal green; And heaven will shine with kindest beams On every work his hands begin. IV But sinners find their counsels crost; As chaff before the tempest flies, So shall their hopes be blown and lost, When the last trumpet shakes the skies. At the last trump, &amp;c. 1 Cor. xv. 52. V In vain the rebel seeks to stand In judgment with the pious race: The dreadful Judge with stern command Divides him to a different place. VI ‘Straight is the way my saints have trod, ‘I blest the path and drew it plain; ‘But you would choose the crooked road, ‘And down it leads to endless pain.’ PSALM 2. (S. M.) Christ Dying, Rising, Interceding, and Reigning. Translated according to the Divine Pattern, Acts iv. 24, &amp;c. I Maker and sovereign Lord Lord, thou art God, who hast made heaven—Who, by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, &amp;c. Acts iv. 24, &amp;c. Of heaven, and earth, and seas, Thy providence confirms thy word, To do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined to be done, &amp;c. verse 28. and several other lines of this version are evidently borrowed from the fuller discoveries of Christ in the New Testament. And answers thy decrees. II The things so long foretold By David are fulfill'd, When Jews and gentiles join'd to slay Jesus, thine holy child. III Why did the gentiles rage, And Jews with one accord, Bend all their counsels to destroy Th'anointed of the Lord? IV Rulers and kings agree To form a vain design; Against the Lord their powers unite, Against his Christ they join. V The Lord derides their rage, And will support his throne; He that hath rais'd him from the dead Hath own'd him for his Son. VI Now he's ascended high, And asks to rule the earth; The merit of his blood he pleads, And pleads his heavenly birth. VII He asks, and God bestows A large inheritance; Far as the world's remotest ends His kingdom shall advance. VIII The nations that rebel Shall rule the nations with a rod of iron, even as I received of my Father, Rev. ii. 27. Must feel his iron rod; He'll vindicate those honours well Which he receiv'd from God. IX Be wise, ye rulers, now, And worship at his throne; With trembling joy, ye people, bow To God's exalted Son. X If once his wrath arise, Ye perish on the place; Then blessed is the soul that flies For refuge to his grace. PSALM 2. (C. M.) [Why did the nations join to slay] I Why did the nations join to slay The Lord's anointed Son? Why did they cast his laws away, And tread his gospel down? II The Lord that sits above the skies Derides their rage below, He speaks with vengeance in his eyes, And strikes their spirits through. III ‘I call him my eternal Son, ‘And raise him from the dead; ‘I make my holy hill his throne, ‘And wide his kingdom spread. IV ‘Ask me, my Son, and then enjoy ‘The utmost heathen lands: ‘Thy rod of iron shall destroy ‘The rebel that withstands.’ V Be wise, ye rulers of the earth, Obey th'anointed Lord, Adore the King of heavenly birth, And tremble at his word. VI With humble love address his throne, For if he frown, ye die; Those are secure, and those alone, Who on his grace rely. PSALM 2. (L. M.) Christ's Death, Resurrection, and Ascension. I Why did the Jews proclaim their rage? The Romans why their swords employ? Against the Lord their powers engage His dear anointed to destroy? II ‘Come, let us break his bands,’ they say, ‘This man shall never give us laws;’ And thus they cast his yoke away, And nail'd the monarch to the cross. III But God, who high in glory reigns, Laughs at their pride, their rage controls; He'll vex their hearts with inward pains, And speak in thunder to their souls. IV ‘I will maintain the King I made ‘On Zion's everlasting hill, ‘My hand shall bring him from the dead, ‘And he shall stand your sovereign still.’ V His wondrous rising from the earth Declared to be the Son of God with power, by his resurrection from the dead, Rom. i. 4. Makes his eternal Godhead known; The Lord declares his heavenly birth, ‘This day have I begot my Son. VI ‘Ascend, my Son, to my right hand, ‘There thou shalt ask, and I bestow ‘The utmost bounds of heathen lands; ‘To thee the northern isles shall bow.’ VII But nations that resist his grace Shall fall beneath his iron stroke; His rod shall crush his foes with ease As potters' earthen work is broke. VIII Now, ye that sit on earthly thrones, Be wise, and serve the Lord, the Lamb, Now at his feet submit your crowns, Rejoice and tremble at his name. IX With humble love address the Son, Lest he grow angry, and ye die; His wrath will burn to worlds unknown, If ye provoke his jealousy. X His storms shall drive you quick to hell, He is a God, and ye but dust: Happy the souls that know him well, And make his grace their only trust. PSALM 3. (C. M.) Doubts and Fears supprest; or, God our Defence from Sin and Satan. I My God how many are my fears! How fast my foes increase! Conspiring my eternal death, They break my present peace. II The lying tempter would persuade There's no relief in heaven; And all my swelling sins appear Too big to be forgiven. III But thou, my glory and my strength, Shalt on the tempter tread, Shalt silence all my threatening guilt, And raise my drooping head. IV I cry'd, and from his holy hill He bow'd a listening ear, I call'd my Father, and my God, And he subdued my fear. V He shed soft slumbers on mine eyes, In spite of all my foes; I 'woke, and wondered at the grace That guarded my repose. VI What tho' the hosts of death and hell All arm'd against me stood, Terrors no more shall shake my soul, My refuge is my God. VII Arise, O Lord, fulfil thy grace, While I thy glory sing: My God has broke the serpent's teeth, And death has lost his sting. VIII Salvation to the Lord belongs, His arm alone can save: Blessings attend thy people here, And reach beyond the grave. In this psalm I have changed David's personal enemies into the spiritual enemies of every christian, namely, sin, Satan, &amp;c. and have mentioned the serpent, the tempter, the guilt of sin, and the sting of death; which are words well known in the New Testament. PSALM 3. v. 1–5, 8. (L. M.) A Morning Psalm. I O Lord, how many are my foes, In this weak state of flesh and blood! My peace they daily discompose, But my defence and hope is God. II Tir'd with the burdens of the day, To thee I rais'd an evening cry; Thou heard'st when I began to pray, And thine Almighty help was nigh. III Supported by thine heavenly aid, I laid me down and slept secure; Not death should make my heart afraid Tho' I should wake and rise no more. IV But God sustain'd me all the night; Salvation doth to God belong; He rais'd my head to see the light, And make his praise my morning song. In the third and fourth psalm there is a verse or two that shews the one to be writ in the morning, the other in the evening; wherefore I have chosen out those parts that seem most easily applicable, and have turned them into a morning and evening song. PSALM 4. v. 1–3, 5–7. (L. M.) Hearing of Prayer; or, God our portion, and Christ our Hope. I O God of grace and righteousness, Hear and attend when I complain; Thou hast enlarg'd me in distress, Bow down a gracious ear again. II Ye sons of men, in vain ye try To turn my glory into shame; How long will scoffers love to lie, And dare reproach my Saviour's name? III Know that the Lord divides his saints From all the tribes of men beside; He hears the cry of penitents For the dear sake of Christ that dy'd. IV When our obedient hands have done A thousand works of righteousness, We put our trust in God alone, And glory in his pardoning grace. V Let the unthinking many say, ‘Who will bestow some earthly good? But, Lord, thy light and love we pray, Our souls desire this heavenly food. VI Then shall my cheerful powers rejoice At grace and favours so divine; Nor will I change my happy choice, For all their corn, and all their wine. Though this psalm may not directly intend the Messiah, yet I have taken occasion to apply some expressions in it to Christ and his gospel, I hope with some advantage, and without offence. PSALM 4. v. 3–5, 8, (C. M.) An Evening Psalm. I Lord, thou wilt hear me when I pray; I am for ever thine: I fear before thee all the day, Nor would I dare to sin. II And while I rest my weary head From cares and business free, 'Tis sweet conversing on my bed With my own heart and thee. III I pay this evening sacrifice; And when my work is done, Great God, my faith and hope relies Upon thy grace alone. IV Thus with my thoughts compos'd to peace, I'll give mine eyes to sleep; Thy hand in safety keeps my days, And will my slumbers keep. PSALM 5. (C. M.) For the Lord's Day Morning. I Lord, in the morning thou shalt hear My voice ascending high; To thee will I direct my prayer, To thee lift up mine eye; II Up to the hills where Christ is gone To plead for all his saints, Presenting at his father's throne Our songs and our complaints. III Thou art a God before whose sight The wicked shall not stand; Sinners shall ne'er be thy delight, Nor dwell at thy right hand. IV But to thy house will I resort To taste thy mercies there; I will frequent thine holy court And worship in thy fear. V O may thy Spirit guide my feet In ways of righteousness! Make every path of duty straight And plain before my face. VI My watchful enemies combine To tempt my feet astray; They flatter with a base design To make my soul their prey. VII Lord, crush the serpent in the dust, And all his plots destroy; While those that in thy mercy trust For ever shout for joy. VIII The men that love and fear thy name Shall see their hopes fulfill'd; The mighty God will compass them With favour as a shield. This psalm begins with the mention of Morning Prayer, and proceeds to the worship of God in his temple; which inclined me to intitle it, for a Lord's Day Morning. Stanza ii. and v. Where any just occasion is given to make mention of Christ, and the Holy Spirit, I refuse it not; and I am persuaded David would not have refused it, had he lived under the gospel; nor St. Paul, had he written a psalm book. PSALM 6. (C. M.) Complaint in Sickness; or, Diseases healed. I In anger, Lord, rebuke me not, Withdraw the dreadful storm; Nor let thy fury grow so hot Against a feeble worm. II My soul's bow'd down with heavy cares, My flesh with pain opprest; My couch is witness to my tears, My tears forbid my rest. III Sorrow and pain wear out my days; I waste the night with cries, Counting the minutes as they pass, Till the slow morning rise. IV Shall I be still tormented more? Mine eye consum'd with grief? How long, my God, how long before Thine hand afford relief? V He hears when dust and ashes speak, He pities all our groans, He saves us for his mercy's sake And heals our broken bones. VI The virtue of his sovereign word Restores our fainting breath; For silent graves praise not the Lord, Nor is he known in death. Vexation by personal enemies is not a constant attendant of sickness; therefore in this version, I have omitted it as a peculiar circumstance of David's. In the next version I have changed these enemies for temptations and despairing thoughts. The fifth verse of this psalm, which is a plea in the prayer, may be naturally transposed to the end, as a ground of praise. PSALM 6. (L. M.) Temptations in Sickness overcome. I Lord, I can suffer thy rebukes, When thou with kindness dost chastise; But thy fierce wrath I cannot bear, O let it not against me rise! II Pity my languishing estate, And ease the sorrows that I feel; The wounds thine heavy hand hath made, O let thy gentler touches heal! III See how I pass my weary days In sighs and groans; and when 'tis night, My bed is water'd with my tears; My grief consumes, and dims my sight. IV Look how the powers of nature mourn! How long, Almighty God, how long? When shall thine hour of grace return? When shall I make thy grace my song? V I feel my flesh so near the grave, My thoughts are tempted to despair; But graves can never praise the Lord, For all is dust and silence there. VI Depart, ye tempters, from my soul, And all despairing thoughts depart; My God, who hears my humble moan, Will ease my flesh, and cheer my heart. Part of the first three stanzas I have borrowed from Dr. Patrick, being pleased with the agreeable turn he gives to David's sense. PSALM 7. (C. M.) God's Care of his People, and Punishment of Persecutors. I My trust is in my heavenly friend, My hope in thee, my God; Rise, and my helpless life defend From those that seek my blood. II With insolence and fury they My soul in pieces tear, As hungry lions rend the prey, When no deliverer's near. III If I had e'er provok'd them first, Or once abus'd my foe, Then let him tread my life to dust, And lay mine honour low. IV If there be malice found in me, I know thy piercing eyes; I should not dare appeal to thee, Nor ask my God to rise. V Arise, my God, lift up thy hand, Their pride and power control; Awake to judgment, and command Deliverance for my soul. VI Let sinners and their wicked rage Be humbled to the dust; Shall not the God of truth engage To vindicate the just? VII He knows the heart, he tries the reins, He will defend th'upright: His sharpest arrows he ordains Against the sons of spite. VIII For me their malice digg'd a pit, But there themselves are cast; My God makes all their mischief light On their own heads at last. IX That cruel persecuting race Must feel his dreadful sword; Awake, my soul, and praise the grace And justice of the Lord. In this psalm I have not exactly followed every single verse of the psalmist, but have endeavoured to contract the substance of it into fewer lines; yet not without a regard to the literal sense and words also, as will appear by the comparison. PSALM 8. (S. M.) God's Sovereignty and Goodness; and Man's Dominion over the Creatures. I O Lord, our heavenly King, Thy name is all divine; Thy glories round the earth are spread, And o'er the heavens they shine. II When to thy works on high I raise my wondering eyes, And see the moon complete in light Adorn the darksome skies: III When I survey the stars, And all their shining forms, Lord, what is man, that worthless thing, A-kin to dust and worms? IV Lord, what is worthless man, That thou should'st love him so? Next to thine angels is he plac'd, And Lord of all below. V Thine honours crown his head, While beasts like slaves obey, And birds that cut the air with wings, And fish that cleave the sea. VI How rich thy bounties are! And wondrous are thy ways: Of dust and worms thy power can frame A monument of praise. VII Out of the mouths of babes The transposing of the second verse of this psalm, towards the end, will not appear offensive, since the connection of it with the other parts of the psalm appears so much more visible. And sucklings thou canst draw Surprising honours to thy name, And strike the world with awe. VIII O Lord, our heavenly King, Thy name is all divine: Thy glories round the earth are spread, And o'er the heavens they shine. PSALM 8. (C. M.) Christ's Condescension and Glorification; or, God made Man. I O Lord, our Lord, how wondrous great Is thine exalted name! The glories of thy heavenly state Let men and babes proclaim. II When I behold thy works on high, The moon that rules the night, And stars that well adorn the sky, Those moving worlds of light; III Lord, what is man, or all his race, Who dwells so far below, That thou should'st visit him with grace, And love his nature so? IV That thine eternal Son should bear If the citation of part of this psalm by the apostle, Heb. ii. 5. be but a mere allusion, yet it affords ground enough for the turn I have given it in this version, and the application of it to Christ. To take a mortal form, Made lower than his angels are, To save a dying worm! V Yet while he liv'd on earth unknown, And men would not adore, Th'obedient seas and fishes own His Godhead and his power. VI The waves lay spread beneath his feet; Jesus went to them walking on the sea, Matt. xiv. 25. And fish, at his command, He said to Simon, launch out, &amp;c. and they enclosed a great multitude of fishes. Luke v. 4, 6. Bring their large shoals to Peter's net, Bring tribute to his hand. Cast an hook, and take up the fish—thou shalt find a piece of money, &amp;c. Matt. xvii. 27. VII These lesser glories of the Son, Shone through the fleshly cloud; Now we behold him on his throne, And men confess him God. VIII Let him be crown'd with majesty Who bow'd his head to death; And be his honours sounded high, By all things that have breath. IX Jesus, our Lord, how wondrous great Is thine exalted name? The glories of thy heavenly state Let the whole earth proclaim. PSALM 8. v. 1, 2. Paraphrased. First Part. (L. M.) The Hosanna of the Children; or, Infants praising God. I Almighty Ruler of the skies, Thro' the wide earth thy name is spread, And thine eternal glories rise O'er all the heavens thy hands have made. II To thee the voices of the young A monument of honour raise; And babes, with uninstructed tongue, Declare the wonders of thy praise. III Thy power assists their tender age To bring proud rebels to the ground, To still the bold blasphemer's rage, And all their policies confound. IV Children amidst thy temple throng To see their great Redeemer's face; The Son of David is their song, And young hosannas fill the place. V The frowning scribes and angry priests In vain their impious cavils bring; Revenge sits silent in their breasts, While Jewish babes proclaim their King. The two first verses are here paraphrased and explained by the history of the children crying hosanna to Christ, Matt. xxi. 15, 16. where our Saviour cites and applies those words of the psalmist. PSALM 8. v. 3, &amp;c. Paraphrased. Second Part. (L. M.) Adam and Christ, Lords of the Old and the New Creation. I Lord, what was man, when made at first, Adam the offspring of the dust, That thou should'st set him and his race But just below an angel's place? II That thou should'st raise his nature so, And make him lord of all below; Make every beast and bird submit, And lay the fishes at his feet? III But O, what brighter glories wait To crown the second Adam's state! What honours shall thy Son adorn Who condescended to be born! IV See him below his angels made, See him in dust amongst the dead, To save a ruin'd world from sin; But he shall reign with power divine. V The world to come, redeem'd from all The miseries that attend the fall, New made, and glorious, shall submit At our exalted Saviour's feet. I am persuaded the true meaning of the apostle, in citing the words of this psalm, and applying them to our Saviour, Heb. ii. 5, &amp;c. is to shew that Christ, the second Adam, must have dominion over the new world, as Adam, the first man, had over the old; and that he is truly and really man, because the first Adam is the figure and type of him in this his dominion. PSALM 9. First Part. (C. M.) Wrath and Mercy from the Judgment Seat. I With my whole heart I'll raise my song, Thy wonders I'll proclaim; Thou sovereign Judge of right and wrong Wilt put my foes to shame. II I'll sing thy majesty and grace; My God prepares his throne To judge the world in righteousness, And make his vengeance known. III Then shall the Lord a refuge prove For all the poor opprest, To save the people of his love, And give the weary rest. IV The men, that know thy name, will trust In thy abundant grace; For thou hast ne'er forsook the just, Who humbly seek thy face. V Sing praises to the righteous Lord, Who dwells on Zion's hill, Who executes his threatening word, And doth his grace fulfil. PSALM 9. v. 12. Second Part. (C. M.) The Wisdom and Equity of Providence. I When the great Judge, supreme and just, Shall once inquire for blood, The humble souls, that mourn in dust, Shall find a faithful God. II He from the dreadful gates of death Does his own children raise: In Zion's gates, with cheerful breath, They sing their Father's praise. III His foes shall fall with heedless feet Into the pit they made; And sinners perish in the net That their own hands had spread. IV Thus by thy judgments mighty God! Are thy deep counsels known; When men of mischief are destroy'd, The snare must be their own. V The wicked shall sink down to hell; Thy wrath devour the lands That dare forget thee, or rebel Against thy known commands. VI Tho' saints to sore distress are brought, And wait and long complain, Their cries shall not be still forgot, Nor shall their hopes be vain. VII Rise, great Redeemer, from thy seat To judge and save the poor; Let nations tremble at thy feet, And man prevail no more. VIII Thy thunder shall affright the proud, And put their hearts to pain, Make them confess that thou art God, And they but feeble men. PSALM 10. (C. M.) Prayer heard, and Saints saved; or, Pride, Atheism, and Oppression punished. For a Humiliation Day. I Why doth the Lord stand off so far, And why conceal his face, When great calamities appear, And times of deep distress? II Lord, shall the wicked still deride Thy justice and thy power? Shall they advance their heads in pride, And still thy saints devour? III They put thy judgments from their sight, And then insult the poor; They boast in their exalted height That they shall fall no more. IV Arise, O God, lift up thine hand, Attend our humble cry; No enemy shall dare to stand When God ascends on high. V Why do the men of malice rage, And say, with foolish pride, ‘The God of heaven will ne'er engage ‘To fight on Zion's side?’ VI But thou for ever art our Lord; And powerful is thine hand, As when the heathens felt thy sword, And perish'd from thy land. VII Thou wilt prepare our hearts to pray, And cause thine ear to hear; He hearkens what his children say, And puts the world in fear. VIII Proud tyrants shall no more oppress, No more despise the just; And mighty sinners shall confess They are but earth and dust. PSALM 11. (L. M.) God loves the Righteous, and hates the Wicked. I My refuge is the God of love; Why do my foes insult and cry, ‘Fly like a timorous trembling dove, ‘To distant woods or mountains fly?’ II If government be all destroy'd, (That firm foundation of our peace) And violence make justice void, Where shall the righteous seek redress? III The Lord in heaven has fix'd his throne, His eye surveys the world below; To him all mortal things are known, His eyelids search our spirits thro'. IV If he afflicts his saints so far To prove their love, and try their grace, What may the bold transgressors fear? His very soul abhors their ways. V On impious wretches he shall rain Tempests of brimstone, fire, and death, Such as he kindled on the plain Of Sodom with his angry breath. VI The righteous Lord loves righteous souls, Whose thoughts and actions are sincere; And with a gracious eye beholds The men that his own image bear. PSALM 12. (L. M.) The Saint's Safety and Hope in Evil Times; or, Sins of the Tongue complained of; viz. Blasphemy, Falsehood, &amp;c. I Lord, if thou dost not soon appear, Virtue and truth will fly away; A faithful man, amongst us here, Will scarce be found, if thou delay. II The whole discourse, when neighbours meet, Is fill'd with trifles loose and vain; Their lips are flattery and deceit, And their proud language is profane. III But lips, that with deceit abound, Shall not maintain their triumph long; The God of vengeance will confound The flattering and blaspheming tongue. IV ‘Yet shall our words be free,’ they cry; ‘Our tongues shall be control'd by none: ‘Where is the Lord will ask us why? ‘Or say, our lips are not our own?’ V The Lord who sees the poor opprest, And hears the oppressor's haughty strain, Will rise to give his children rest, Nor shall they trust his word in vain. VI Thy word, O Lord, tho' often try'd, Void of deceit shall still appear; Not silver, seven times purify'd From dross and mixture, shines so clear. VII Thy grace shall in the darkest hour Defend the holy soul from harm; Tho' when the vilest men have power On every side will sinners swarm. PSALM 12. (C. M.) Complaint of a general Corruption of Manners; or, the Promise and Signs of Christ's coming to Judgment. I Help, Lord, for men of virtue fail, Religion loses ground; The sons of violence prevail, And treacheries abound. II Their oaths and promises they break, Yet act the flatterer's part; With fair deceitful lips they speak, And with a double heart. III If we reprove some hateful lie, How is their fury stirr'd! ‘Are not our lips our own,’ they cry, ‘And who shall be our Lord?’ IV Scoffers appear on every side, The last verse of this psalm may naturally be inserted here. Where a vile race of men Is rais'd to seats of power and pride And bears the sword in vain. V Lord, when iniquities abound, The signs of Christ's coming, mentioned in the New Testament, Matt. xxiv. 12. Luke xviii. 8. are abounding iniquity, love waxing cold, and faith scarce to be found; and seem very much akin to the sense of this psalm. And blasphemy grows bold, When faith is hardly to be found, And love is waxing cold, VI Is not thy chariot hast'ning on? Hast thou not given this sign? May we not trust and live upon A promise so divine? VII ‘Yes,’ saith the Lord, ‘now will I rise, ‘And make oppressors flee; ‘I shall appear to their surprise, ‘And set my servants free.’ VIII Thy word, like silver seven times try'd, Thro' ages shall endure; The men that in thy truth confide Shall find the promise sure. PSALM 13. (L. M.) Pleading with God under Desertion; or, Hope in Darkness. I How long, O Lord, shall I complain Like one that seeks his God in vain? Canst thou thy face for ever hide? And I still pray and be deny'd? II Shall I for ever be forgot As one whom thou regardest not? Still shall my soul thine absence mourn? And still despair of thy return? III How long shall my poor troubled breast Be with these anxious thoughts opprest? And Satan, my malicious foe, Rejoice to see me sunk so low? IV Hear, Lord, and grant me quick relief, Before my death conclude my grief; If thou withhold thy heavenly light, I sleep in everlasting night. V How will the powers of darkness boast, If but one praying soul be lost! But I have trusted in thy grace, And shall again behold thy face. VI Whate'er my fears or foes suggest, Thou art my hope, my joy, my rest; My heart shall feel thy love, and raise My cheerful voice to songs of praise. PSALM 13. (C. M.) Complaint under Temptations of the Devil. I How long wilt thou conceal thy face? My God, how long delay? When shall I feel those heavenly rays That chase my fears away? II How long shall my poor labouring soul Wrestle and toil in vain? Thy word can all my foes control, And ease my raging pain. III See how the prince of darkness tries All his malicious arts, He spreads a mist around my eyes, And throws his fiery darts. IV Be thou my sun, and thou my shield, My soul in safety keep; Make haste before mine eyes are seal'd In death's eternal sleep. V How would the tempter boast aloud If I become his prey! Behold the sons of hell grow proud At thy so long delay. VI But they shall fly at thy rebuke, And Satan hide his head; He knows the terrors of thy look, And hears thy voice with dread. VII Thou wilt display that sovereign grace, Where all my hopes have hung; I shall employ my lips in praise, And victory shall be sung. PSALM 14. First Part. (C. M.) By Nature all Men are Sinners. I Fools in their hearts believe and say, ‘That all religion's vain, ‘There is no God that reigns on high, ‘Or minds th'affairs of men.’ II From thoughts so dreadful and profane Corrupt discourse proceeds; And in their impious hands are found Abominable deeds. III The Lord, from his celestial throne, Look'd down on things below To find the man that sought his grace, Or did his justice know. IV By nature all are gone astray, Their practice all the same; There's none that fears his Maker's hand, There's none that loves his name. V Their tongues are us'd to speak deceit, Their slanders never cease; How swift to mischief are their feet, Nor know the paths of peace! VI Such seeds of sin (that bitter root) In every heart are found; Nor can they bear diviner fruit, Till grace refine the ground. Several verses of this psalm are cited by the apostle, Rom iii. 10, &amp;c. to shew the universal corruption of human nature; wherefore I have brought more of the apostle's words, there used, into the fourth and fifth stanzas here, and concluded this part of the psalm agreeable to Saint Paul's design. Note, The second part of this psalm speaks only of persecutors and the enemies of the church; therefore I have divided it from the former. PSALM 14. Second Part. (C. M). The Folly of Persecutors. I Are sinners now so senseless grown That they the saints devour? And never worship at thy throne, Nor fear thine awful power? II Great God, appear to their surprise, Reveal thy dreadful name; Let them no more thy wrath despise, Nor turn our hope to shame. III Dost thou not dwell among the just? And yet our foes deride, That we should make thy name our trust; Great God, confound their pride. IV O that the joyful day were come To finish our distress! When God shall bring his children home Our songs shall never cease. PSALM 15. (C. M.) Characters of a Saint; or, a Citizen of Zion; or, the Qualifications of a Christian. I Who shall inhabit in thy hill, O God of holiness? Whom will the Lord admit to dwell So near his throne of grace? II The man that walks in pious ways, And works with righteous hands; That trusts his Maker's promises, And follows his commands. III He speaks the meaning of his heart, Nor slanders with his tongue; Will scarce believe an ill report, Nor do his neighbour wrong. IV The wealthy sinner he contemns, Loves all that fear the Lord; And though to his own hurt he swears, Still he performs his word. V His hands disdain a golden bribe, And never gripe the poor; This man shall dwell with God on earth, And find his heaven secure. PSALM 15. (L. M.) Religion and Justice, Goodness and Truth; or, Duties to God and Man; or, the Qualifications of a Christian. I Who shall ascend thy heavenly place, Great God, and dwell before thy face? The man that minds religion now, And humbly walks with God below: II Whose hands are pure, whose heart is clean, Whose lips still speak the thing they mean; No slanders dwell upon his tongue; He hates to do his neighbour wrong. III Scarce will he trust an ill report, Nor vents it to his neighbour's hurt: Sinners of state he can despise, But saints are honour'd in his eyes. IV Firm to his word he ever stood, And always makes his promise good; Nor dares to change the thing he swears, Whatever pain or loss he bears. V He never deals in bribing gold, And mourns that justice should be sold: While others gripe and grind the poor, Sweet charity attends his door. VI He loves his enemies and prays For those that curse him to his face; And doth to all men still the same That he would hope or wish from them. VII Yet when his holiest works are done, His soul depends on grace alone; This is the man thy face shall see, And dwell for ever, Lord with thee. Since our blessed Saviour, in the New Testament, has so much explained the duties of the law and published the gospel, I could not pass over this psalm of the characters of the jewish saint, without inserting some brighter articles that must belong to the christian: Such as, alms and charity to the poor, love to enemies, blessing those that curse us, doing to others as we would have them do to us, and hope of acceptance only through divine grace. I thought it necessary also to leave out the mention of usury, verse 5. which though politically forbidden by the Jews among themselves, was never unlawful to the gentiles, nor to any christians, since the Jewish polity expired. PSALM 16. First Part. (L. M.) Confession of our Poverty, and Saints the best Company; or Good Works profit Men, not God. I Preserve me, Lord, in time of need; For succour to thy throne I flee, But have no merits there to plead; My goodness cannot reach to thee. II Oft have my heart and tongue confest How empty and how poor I am; My praise can never make thee blest, Nor add new glories to thy name. III Yet, Lord, thy saints on earth may reap Some profit by the good we do; These are the company I keep, These are the choicest friends I know. IV Let others choose the sons of mirth To give a relish to their wine, I love the men of heavenly birth Whose thoughts and language are divine. PSALM 16. Second Part. (L. M.) Christ's All-sufficiency. I How fast their guilt and sorrows rise, Who haste to seek some idol god! I will not taste their sacrifice, Their offerings of forbidden blood. II My God provides a richer cup, A nobler food to live upon; He for my life has offered up Jesus his best beloved Son. III His love is my perpetual feast; By day his counsels guide me right; And be his name for ever blest, Who gives me sweet advice by night. IV I set him still before mine eyes; At my right hand he stands prepar'd To keep my soul from all surprise, And be my everlasting guard. From the psalmist's mention of drink-offerings of blood, I take occasion to allude to the sacrifice of Christ. His flesh is meat indeed, and his blood is drink indeed, John vi. 55. PSALM 16. Third Part. (L. M.) Courage in Death, and Hope of the Resurrection. I When God is nigh, my faith is strong, His arm is my almighty prop: Be glad, my heart; rejoice, my tongue, My dying flesh shall rest in hope. II Tho' in the dust I lay my head, Yet, gracious God, thou wilt not leave My soul for ever with the dead, Nor lose thy children in the grave. III My flesh shall thy first call obey, Shake off the dust, and rise on high; Then shalt thou lead the wondrous way Up to thy throne above the sky. IV There streams of endless pleasure flow; And full discoveries of thy grace (Which we but tasted here below) Spread heavenly joys thro' all the place. The last verses of this psalm are applied only to Christ, Acts xiii. 36. and ii. 23, &amp;c. yet since they contain so fair a view of the resurrection, which is so seldom found in this book, I have formed these four stanzas into such expressions as may be assumed by christians, and applied to themselves. PSALM 16. v. 1–8. First Part. (C. M.) Support and Counsel from God without Merit. I Save me, O Lord, from every foe, In thee my trust I place, Tho' all the good that I can do Can ne'er deserve thy grace. II Yet if my God prolong my breath, The saints may profit by't; The saints the glory of the earth, The men of my delight. III Let heathens to their idols haste, And worship wood or stone; But my delightful lot is cast Where the true God is known. IV His hand provides my constant food, He fills my daily cup; Much am I pleas'd with present good, But more rejoice in hope. V God is my portion and my joy, His counsels are my light; He gives me sweet advice by day, And gentle hints by night. VI My soul would all her thoughts approve To his all-seeing eye; Not death, nor hell my hope shall move, While such a friend is nigh. PSALM 16. Second Part. (C. M.) The Death and Resurrection of Christ. I ‘I set the Lord before my face, ‘He bears my courage up; ‘My heart and tongue their joys express, ‘My flesh shall rest in hope. II ‘My spirit, Lord, thou wilt not leave It is now agreed by the learned, that Sheol, which is rendered hell, signifies only the state of the dead; that is, the grave for the body, and the separate state for the spirit. ‘Where souls departed are; ‘Nor quit my body to the grave ‘To see corruption there. III ‘Thou wilt reveal the path of life, ‘And raise me to thy throne; ‘Thy courts immortal pleasure give, ‘Thy presence joys unknown.’ IV Thus in the name of Christ, the Lord, The holy David sung, And Providence fulfils the word Of his prophetic tongue. V Jesus, whom every saint adores, Was crucify'd and slain; Behold the tomb its prey restores, Behold he lives again! VI When shall my feet arise and stand On heaven's eternal hills? There sits the Son at God's right hand, And there the Father smiles. In this version I have applied the three last verses of this psalm to Christ alone, as St. Peter applies them, Acts ii. 23. yet instead of the fourth line of the second stanza, To see corruption there, you may read thus, To dwell for ever there. And then the first three stanzas may be sung alone, and applied to every christian. PSALM 17. v. 13, &amp;c. (S. M.) Portion of Saints and Sinners; or, Hope and Despair in Death. I Arise, my gracious God, And make the wicked flee; They are but thy chastising rod To drive thy saints to thee. II Behold the sinner dies, His haughty words are vain; Here in this life his pleasure lies, And all beyond is pain. III Then let his pride advance, And boast of all his store; The Lord is my inheritance, My soul can wish no more. IV I shall behold the face Of my forgiving God, And stand complete in righteousness, Wash'd in my Saviour's blood. V There's a new heaven begun, The heaven which souls enjoy in the separate state, is so much increased by the resurrection of the body, that it may be called a New Heaven, the heaven of the body as well as of the soul. When I awake from death, Drest in the likeness of thy Son, And draw immortal breath. PSALM 17. (L. M.) The Sinner's Portion and Saint's Hope; or, the Heaven of separate Souls, and the Resurrection. I Lord, I am thine; but thou wilt prove My faith, my patience, and my love: When men of spite against me join, They are the sword, the hand is thine. II Their hope and portion lies below; 'Tis all the happiness they know, 'Tis all they seek; they take their shares, And leave the rest among their heirs. III What sinners value, I resign; Lord, 'tis enough that thou art mine; I shall behold thy blissful face, And stand complete in righteousness. IV This life's a dream, an empty show; But the bright world to which I go Hath joys substantial and sincere; When shall I wake, and find me there? V O glorious hour! O blest abode! I shall be near and like my God! And flesh and sin no more control The sacred pleasures of the soul. VI My flesh shall slumber in the ground, Till the last trumpet's joyful sound; Then burst the chains with sweet surprise, And in my Saviour's image rise. The sense of a great part of this psalm occurs so frequently in the Book of Psalms, that I thought it necessary to translate no more than these few verses of it; namely, ver. 3. Thou hast proved my heart, thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing. Ver. 13. The wicked are thy sword. Ver. 14. The men of the world have their portion in this life, whose belly thou fillest: They leave the rest of their substance to their babes. Ver. 15. I shall behold thy face in righteousness, I shall be satisfied when I awake with thy likeness. I confess I have indulged a large exposition here, but I could not forbear to give my thoughts a loose upon this divine description of complete blessedness in the 15th verse; this bright abridgment of heaven. From the word Awake, I have taken occasion to represent the departing soul's awaking into the world of spirits, as well as the body's awaking from the grave. PSALM 18. v. 1–6, 15–18. First Part. (L. M.) Deliverance from Despair; or, Temptations overcome. I Thee will I love, O Lord, my strength, My rock, my tower, my high defence; Thy mighty arm shall be my trust, For I have found salvation thence. II Death, and the terrors of the grave, Stood round me with their dismal shade; While floods of high temptations rose, And made my sinking soul afraid. III I saw the opening gates of hell, With endless pains and sorrows there, Which none but they that feel can tell, While I was hurry'd to despair. IV In my distress I call'd my God, When I could scarce believe him mine; He bow'd his ear to my complaint, Then did his grace appear divine. V With speed he flew to my relief, As on a cherub's wing he rode; Awful and bright as lightning shone The face of my deliverer, God. VI Temptations fled at his rebuke, The blast of his almighty breath; He sent salvation from on high, And drew me from the deeps of death. VII Great were my fears, my foes were great, Much was their strength, and more their rage; But Christ, my Lord, is conqueror still In all the wars that devils wage. VIII My song for ever shall record That terrible, that joyful hour; And give the glory to the Lord Due to his mercy and his power. I have divided this long psalm into three parts, and accommodated the several verses of it to our spiritual warfare and victory through grace, as being of more frequent and general use to christians; yet there are so noble expressions of triumph in God, and thanks for victory over temporal enemies scattered up and down, that persuaded me to form them afterwards in common metre also, agreeable to their original design. PSALM 18. v. 20–26. Second Part. (L. M.) Sincerity proved and rewarded. I Lord, thou hast seen my soul sincere, Hast made thy truth and love appear; Before mine eyes I set thy laws, And thou hast own'd my righteous cause. II Since I have learnt thy holy ways, I've walk'd upright before thy face; Or if my feet did e'er depart, 'Twas never with a wicked heart. III What sore temptations broke my rest! What wars and strugglings in my breast! But thro' thy grace that reigns within, I guard against my darling sin: IV That sin which close besets me still, That works and strives against my will; When shall thy Spirit's sovereign power Destroy it, that it rise no more? V With an impartial hand, the Lord Deals out to mortals their reward; The kind and faithful souls shall find A God as faithful and as kind. VI The just and pure shall ever say Thou art more pure, more just than they; And men that love revenge shall know God hath an arm of vengeance too. PSALM 18. v. 30, 31, 34, 35, 46, &amp;c. Third Part (L. M.) Rejoicing in God; or, Salvation and Triumph. I Just are thy ways, and true thy word, Great rock of my secure abode; Who is a God beside the Lord? Or where's a refuge like our God? II 'Tis he that girds me with his might, Gives me his holy sword to wield; And while with sin and hell I fight, Spreads his salvation for my shield. III He lives (and blessed be my rock!) The God of my salvation lives, The dark designs of hell are broke; Sweet is the peace my father gives. IV Before the scoffers of the age, I will exalt my Father's name, Nor tremble at their mighty rage, But meet reproach, and bear the shame. V To David and his royal seed Thy grace for ever shall extend; Thy love to saints in Christ their head Knows not a limit, nor an end. PSALM 18. First Part. (C. M.) Victory and Triumph over temporal Enemies. I We love thee, Lord, and we adore, Now is thine arm reveal'd; Thou art our strength, our heavenly tower, Our bulwark and our shield. II We fly to our eternal rock, And find a sure defence; His holy name our lips invoke, And draw salvation thence. III When God, our leader, shines in arms, What mortal heart can bear The thunder of his loud alarms? The lightning of his spear? IV He rides upon the winged wind, And angels in array In millions wait to know his mind, And swift as flames obey. V He speaks, and at his fierce rebuke Whole armies are dismay'd; His voice, his frown, his angry look Strikes all their courage dead. VI He forms our generals for the field, With all their dreadful skill; Gives them his awful sword to wield, And makes their hearts of steel. VII He arms our captains to the fight, Isaiah xlv. 1, 5. Thus saith the Lord to Cyrus,—I girded thee, though thou hast not known me. (Tho' there his name's forgot: He girded Cyrus with his might, But Cyrus knew him not.) VIII Oft has the Lord whole nations blest For his own church's sake: The powers that give his people rest Shall of his care partake. PSALM 18. Second Part. (C. M.) The Conqueror's Song. I To thine almighty arm we owe The triumphs of the day; Thy terrors Lord, confound the foe, And melt their strength away. II 'Tis by thine aid our troops prevail, And break united powers, Or burn their boasted fleets, or scale The proudest of their towers. III How have we chas'd them thro' the field, And trod them to the ground, While thy salvation was our shield, But they no shelter found! IV In vain to idol-saints they cry, And perish in their blood; Where is a rock so great, so high, So powerful as our God? V The rock of Israel ever lives, His name be ever blest; 'Tis his own arm the victory gives, And gives his people rest. VI On kings that reign as David did He pours his blessings down; Secures their honours to their seed, And well supports the crown. PSALM 19. First Part. (S. M.) The Book of Nature and Scripture. For a Lord's Day Morning. I Behold the lofty sky Declares its maker God, And all his starry works on high Proclaim his power abroad. II The darkness and the light Still keep their course the same; While night to day and day to night Divinely teach his name. III In every different land Their general voice is known; They shew the wonders of his hand, And orders of his throne. IV Ye British lands, rejoice, Here he reveals his word, We are not left to nature's voice To bid us know the Lord. V His statutes and commands Are set before our eyes, He puts his gospel in our hands Where our salvation lies. VI His laws are just and pure, His truth without deceit, His promises for ever sure, And his rewards are great. VII Not honey to the taste Affords so much delight, Nor gold that has the furnace past So much allures the sight. VIII While of thy works I sing, I have here inserted the last verse of the psalm with an evangelical turn, as a proper conclusion of this first part; the whole being too long to be sung at once, according to our present custom. Thy glory to proclaim, Accept the praise, my God, my king, In my Redeemer's name. The psalmist here, and in other psalms, uses the word Law, to express the five books of Moses, or all the divine Revelation that he had in his time; yet Christ and the apostles so frequently distinguish the law and the gospel, that I have chosen to imitate their language, and have often introduced the words gospel, truth, and promise, instead of statues, testimonies, &amp;c. as being more agreeable to the style of the New Testament. PSALM 19. Second Part. (S. M.) God's Word most excellent; or, Sincerity and Watchfulness. For a Lord's Day Morning. I Behold the morning sun Begins his glorious way; His beams thro' all the nations run, And life and light convey. II But where the gospel comes, It spreads diviner light, It calls dead sinners from their tombs, And gives the blind their sight. III How perfect is thy word! And all thy judgments just! For ever sure thy promise, Lord, And men securely trust. IV My gracious God, how plain Are thy directions given! O! may I never read in vain, But find the path to heaven! V I hear thy word with love, And I would fain obey; Send thy good Spirit from above To guide me, lest I stray. VI O who can ever find The errors of his ways? Yet with a bold presumptuous mind I would not dare transgress. VII Warn me of every sin, Forgive my secret faults, And cleanse this guilty soul of mine, Whose crimes exceed my thoughts. VIII While with my heart and tongue, I spread thy praise abroad, Accept the worship and the song, My Saviour and my God. PSALM 19. (L. M.) The Books of Nature and of Scripture compared; or, the Glory and Success of the Gospel. I The heavens declare thy glory, Lord, In every star thy wisdom shines; But when our eyes behold thy word, We read thy name in fairer lines. II The rolling sun, the changing light, And nights and days thy power confess; But the blest volume thou hast writ Reveals thy justice and thy grace. III Sun, moon, and stars convey thy praise Round the whole earth, and never stand; So when thy truth begun its race, It touch'd and glanc'd on every land. IV Nor shall thy spreading gospel rest, Till through the world thy truth has run; Till Christ has all the nations blest That see the light, or feel the sun. V Great Sun of Righteousness, arise, Bless the dark world with heavenly light; Thy gospel makes the simple wise, Thy laws are pure, thy judgments right. VI Thy noblest wonders here we view In souls renew'd and sins forgiven: Lord, cleanse my sins, my soul renew, And make thy word my guide to heaven. Though the plain design of the psalmist is to shew the excellency of the book of Scripture above the book of Nature, in order to convert and save a sinner, yet the apostle Paul, in Rom. x. 18. applies or accommodates the fourth verse to the spreading of the gospel over the Roman empire, which is called the whole world in the New Testament: And in this version I have endeavoured to imitate him. PSALM 19. To the Tune of the 113th Psalm. The Book of Nature and Scripture. I Great God the heaven's well-order'd frame Declares the glories of thy name; There thy rich works of wonder shine: A thousand starry beauties there, A thousand radiant marks appear Of boundless power and skill divine. II From night to day, from day to night, The dawning and the dying light Lectures of heavenly wisdom read; With silent eloquence they raise Our thoughts to our Creator's praise, And neither sound nor language need. III Yet their divine instructions run Far as the journies of the sun, And every nation knows their voice: The sun, like some young bridegroom drest, Breaks from the chambers of the east, Rolls round and makes the earth rejoice. IV Where'er he spreads his beams abroad, He smiles and speaks his maker God; All nature joins to shew thy praise: Thus God in every creature shines; Fair is the book of nature's lines, But fairer is thy book of grace. V I love the volumes of thy word; What light and joy those leaves afford To souls benighted and distrest! Thy precepts guide my doubtful way, Thy fear forbids my feet to stray, Thy promise leads my heart to rest. VI From the discoveries of thy law, The perfect rules of life I draw, These are my study and delight: Not honey so invites the taste, Nor gold, that hath the furnace past, Appears so pleasing to the sight. VII Thy threatenings wake my slumbering eyes, And warn me where my danger lies; But 'tis thy blessed gospel, Lord, That makes my guilty conscience clean, Converts my soul, subdues my sin, And gives a free but large reward. VIII Who knows the errors of his thoughts? My God, forgive my secret faults, And from presumptuous sins restrain: Accept my poor attempts of praise That I have read thy book of grace, And book of nature, not in vain. PSALM 20. (L. M.) Prayer and Hope of Victory. For a Day of Prayer in time of War. I Now may the God of power and grace Attend his people's humble cry! Jehovah hears when Israel prays, And brings deliverance from on high. II The name of Jacob's God defends Better than shields or brazen walls; He from his sanctuary sends Succour and strength, when Zion calls. III Well he remembers all our sighs, His love exceeds our best deserts; His love accepts the sacrifice Of humble groans and broken hearts. IV In his salvation is our hope, And in the name of Israel's God, Our troops shall lift their banners up, Our navies spread their flags abroad. V Some trust in horses train'd for war, And some of chariots make their boasts; Our surest expectations are From thee, the Lord of heavenly hosts. VI O! may the memory of thy name Inspire our armies for the fight! Our foes shall fall and die with shame, Or quit the field with shameful flight. VII Now save us, Lord, from slavish fear, Now let our hopes be firm and strong, Till the salvation shall appear, And joy and triumph raise the song. PSALM 21. (C. M.) Our King is the Care of Heaven. I The king, O Lord, with songs of praise, Shall in thy strength rejoice: And, blest with thy salvation, raise To heaven his cheerful voice. II Thy sure defence, thro' nations round, Has spread his glorious name; And his successful actions crown'd With majesty and fame. III Then let the king on God alone For timely aid rely; His mercy shall support the throne, And all our wants supply. IV But, righteous Lord, his stubborn foes Shall feel thy dreadful hand; Thy vengeful arm shall find out those That hate his mild command. V When thou against them dost engage, Thy just but dreadful doom Shall, like a fiery oven's rage, Their hopes and them consume. VI Thus, Lord, thy wondrous power declare, And thus exalt thy fame; Whilst we glad songs of praise prepare For thine almighty name. I have borrowed almost all these stanzas from Mr. Tate's version, and they seem very applicable to his present majesty King George, 1716. PSALM 21. v. 1–9. (L. M.) Christ exalted to the Kingdom. I David rejoic'd in God his strength, Rais'd to the throne by special grace; But Christ, the Son, appears at length, Fulfils the triumph and the praise. II How great is the Messiah's joy In the salvation of thy hand! Lord, thou hast rais'd his kingdom high, And given the world to his command. III Thy goodness grants whate'er he will, Nor doth the least request withhold; Blessings of love prevent him still, And crowns of glory, not of gold. IV Honour and majesty divine Around his sacred temples shine; Blest with the favour of thy face, And length of everlasting days. V Thine hand shall find out all his foes; And as a fiery oven glows, With raging heat and living coals, So shall thy wrath devour their souls. PSALM 22. v. 1–16. First Part. (C. M.) The Sufferings and Death of Christ. I Why has my God my soul forsook, Nor will a smile afford? (Thus David once in anguish spoke, And thus our dying Lord.) II Tho' 'tis thy chief delight to dwell Among thy praising saints, Yet thou canst hear a groan as well, And pity our complaints. III Our fathers trusted in thy name, And great deliverance found; But I'm a worm, despis'd of men, And trodden to the ground. IV Shaking the head they pass me by, And laugh my soul to scorn; ‘In vain he trusts in God,’ they cry, ‘Neglected and forlorn.’ V But thou art he who form'd my flesh By thine almighty word; And since I hung upon the breast, My hope is in the Lord. VI Why will my Father hide his face, When foes stand threatening round, In the dark hour of deep distress, And not an helper found? VII Behold thy darling left among The cruel and the proud, As bulls of Bashan fierce and strong, As lions roaring loud. VIII From earth and hell my sorrows meet To multiply the smart; They nail my hands, they pierce my feet, And try to vex my heart. IX Yet if thy sovereign hand let loose The rage of earth and hell, Why will my heavenly father bruise The Son he loves so well? X My God, if possible it be, Withhold this bitter cup; But I resign my will to thee, And drink the sorrows up. XI My heart dissolves with pangs unknown, In groans I waste my breath; Thy heavy hand has brought me down Low as the dust of death. XII Father, I give my spirit up, And trust it in thy hand; My dying flesh shall rest in hope, And rise at thy command. PSALM 22. v. 20, 21, 27–31. Second Part. (C. M.) Christ's Sufferings and Kingdom. I ‘Now from the roaring lion's rage, ‘O Lord, protect thy son; ‘Nor leave thy darling to engage ‘The powers of hell alone. II Thus did our suffering Saviour pray, With mighty cries and tears; God heard him in that dreadful day, And chas'd away his fears. III Great was the victory of his death, His throne exalted high; And all the kindreds of the earth Shall worship or shall die. IV A numerous offspring must arise From his expiring groans; They shall be reckon'd in his eyes For daughters and for sons. V The meek and humble souls shall see His table richly spread; And all that seek the Lord shall be With joys immortal fed. VI The isles shall know the righteousness Of our incarnate God; And nations yet unborn profess Salvation in his blood. PSALM 22. (L. M.) Christ's Sufferings and Exaltation. I Now let our mournful songs record The dying sorrows of our Lord, When he complain'd in tears and blood As one forsaken of his God. II The Jews beheld him thus forlorn, And shake their heads, and laugh in scorn; ‘He rescu'd others from the grave, ‘Now let him try himself to save. III ‘This is the man did once pretend ‘God was his Father and his friend; ‘If God the blessed lov'd him so, ‘Why doth he fail to help him now? IV Barbarous people! cruel priests! How they stood round like savage beasts! Like lions gaping to devour, When God had left him in their power. V They wound his head, his hands, his feet, Till streams of blood each other meet; By lot his garments they divide, And mock the pangs in which he dy'd. VI But God, his Father, heard his cry; Rais'd from the dead he reigns on high; The nations learn his righteousness, And humble sinners taste his grace. In this version I have abridged the whole psalm, and chosen only those verses of it which are cited or explained in the New Testament, namely, 1, 7, 8, 12, 13, 16, 18, 24, 28, 29, 31. PSALM 23. (L. M.) God our Shepherd. I My shepherd is the living Lord; Now shall my wants be well supply'd; His providence and holy word Become my safety and my guide. II In pastures where salvation grows He makes me feed, he makes me rest; There living water gently flows, And all the food divinely blest. III My wandering feet his ways mistake, But he restores my soul to peace And leads me, for his mercy's sake In the fair paths of righteousness. IV Tho' I walk thro' the gloomy vale, Where death and all its terrors are, My heart and hope shall never fail, For God my shepherd's with me there. V Amidst the darkness and the deeps Thou art my comfort, thou my stay; Thy staff supports my feeble steps, Thy rod directs my doubtful way. VI The sons of earth and sons of hell, Gaze at thy goodness, and repine To see my table spread so well With living bread and cheerful wine. VII How I rejoice when on my head Thy Spirit condescends to rest! 'Tis a divine anointing shed Like oil of gladness at a feast. VIII Surely the mercies of the Lord Attend his household all their days; There will I dwell to hear his word, To seek his face, and sing his praise. PSALM 23. (C. M.) The Same. [My shepherd will supply my need] I My shepherd will supply my need, Jehovah is his name; In pastures fresh he makes me feed Beside the living stream. II He brings my wandering spirit back, When I forsake his ways; And leads me, for his mercy's sake, In paths of truth and grace. III When I walk through the shades of death, Thy presence is my stay; A word of thy supporting breath Drives all my fears away. IV Thy hand, in spite of all my foes, The oil or ointment that was used of old to anoint and perfume the head, in the sense and language of the New Testament, must signify the communications of the Holy Spirit, which is called the anointing, 1 John ii. 20, 27. as I have explained it in the long metre; and Psalm xiv. 7. with John iii. 34. approves it. Doth still my table spread; My cup with blessings overflows, Thine oil anoints my head. V The sure provisions of my God Attend me all my days; O may thy house be mine abode, And all my works be praise! VI There would I find a settled rest, (While others go and come) No more a stranger or a guest, But like a child at home. PSALM 23. (S. M.) The same. [The Lord my shepherd is] I The Lord my shepherd is, I shall be well supply'd, Since he is mine, and I am his, What can I want beside? II He leads me to the place Where heavenly pasture grows, Where living waters gently pass, And full salvation flows. III If e'er I go astray, He doth my soul reclaim, And guides me in his own right way, For his most holy name. IV While he affords his aid, I cannot yield to fear; Tho' I should walk thro' death's dark shade My shepherd's with me there. V In spite of all my foes, Thou dost my table spread, My cup with blessings overflows, And joy exalts my head. VI The bounties of thy love Shall crown my following days; Nor from thy house will I remove, Nor cease to speak thy praise. PSALM 24. (C. M.) Dwelling with God. I The earth for ever is the Lord's, With Adam's numerous race; He rais'd its arches o'er the floods, And built it on the seas. II But who among the sons of men May visit thine abode? He that has hands from mischief clean, Whose heart his right with God. III This is the man may rise and take The blessings of his grace; This is the lot of those that seek The God of Jacob's face. IV Now let our soul's immortal powers To meet the Lord prepare, Lift up their everlasting doors, The King of glory's near. V The King of glory! Who can tell The wonders of his might? He rules the nations; but to dwell With saints is his delight. PSALM 24. (L. M.) Saints dwell in Heaven; or, Christ's Ascension. I This spacious earth is all the Lord's, And men, and worms, and beasts, and birds: He rais'd the building on the seas, And gave it for their dwelling-place. II But there's a brighter world on high, Thy palace, Lord, above the sky: Who shall ascend that blest abode, And dwell so near his maker God? III He that abhors and fears to sin, Whose heart is pure, whose hands are clean, Him shall the Lord the Saviour bless, And clothe his soul with righteousness. IV These are the men, the pious race That seek the God of Jacob's face; These shall enjoy the blissful sight, And dwell in everlasting light. V Rejoice, ye shining worlds on high, Behold the King of glory nigh! Who can this King of glory be? The mighty Lord, the Saviour's he. VI Ye heavenly gates, your leaves display To make the Lord the Saviour way: Laden with spoils from earth and hell, The conqueror comes with God to dwell. VII Rais'd from the dead he goes before, He opens heaven's eternal door, To give his saints a blest abode Near their Redeemer, and their God. If this psalm was written at the ascent of the ark of God into Zion the city of David, it is not unnatural to apply it to the presence of Christ with his church in worship, as in the common metre; or to the ascension of Christ to Heaven, as in this metre. In this, and other parts of the psalm, I have endeavoured to make the connexion plain and easy, which is very obscure in the text. PSALM 25. v. 1–11. First Part. (S. M.) Waiting for Pardon and Direction. I I lift my soul to God, My trust is in his name; Let not my foes that seek my blood Still triumph in my shame. II Sin and the powers of hell Persuade me to despair; Lord, make me know thy covenant well, That I may 'scape the snare. III From the first dawning light Till the dark evening rise, For thy Salvation, Lord, I wait With ever-longing eyes. IV Remember all thy grace, And lead me in thy truth: Forgive the sins of riper days, And follies of my youth. V The Lord is just and kind, The meek shall learn his ways, And every humble sinner find The methods of his grace. VI For his own goodness sake He saves my soul from shame; He pardons (though my guilt be great) Thro' my Redeemer's name. PSALM 25. v. 12, 14, 10, 13. Second Part. (S. M.) Divine Instruction. I Where shall the man be found That fears t'offend his God, That loves the gospel's joyful sound, And trembles at the rod? II The Lord shall make him know The secrets of his heart, The wonders of his covenant show, And all his love impart. III The dealings of his hand Are truth and mercy still With such as to his covenant stand, And love to do his will. IV Their souls shall dwell at ease Before their Maker's face, Their seed shall taste the promises In their extensive grace. PSALM 25. v. 15–22. Third Part. (S. M.) Distress of Soul; or, Backsliding and Desertion. I Mine eyes and my desire Are ever to the Lord; I love to plead his promises, And rest upon his word. II Turn, turn thee to my soul, Bring thy salvation near; When will thy hand release my feet Out of the deadly snare? III When shall the sovereign grace Of my forgiving God Restore me from those dangerous ways My wandering feet have trod? IV The tumult of my thoughts Doth but enlarge my woe; My spirit languishes, my heart Is desolate and low. V With every morning light My sorrow new begins; Look on my anguish and my pain, And pardon all my sins. VI Behold the hosts of hell, How cruel is their hate! Against my life they rise, and join Their fury with deceit. VII O keep my soul from death, Nor put my hope to shame, For I have plac'd my only trust In my Redeemer's name. VIII With humble faith I wait To see thy face again; ‘Of Israel it shall ne'er be said, ‘He sought the Lord in vain.’ PSALM 26. (L. M.) Self-examination; or, Evidences of Grace. I Judge me O Lord, and prove my ways, And try my reins, and try my heart; My faith upon thy promise stays, Nor from thy law my feet depart. II I hate to walk, I hate to sit With men of vanity and lies; The scoffer and the hypocrite Are the abhorrence of mine eyes. III Amongst thy saints will I appear, With hands well-wash'd in innocence; But when I stand before thy bar, The blood of Christ is my defence. IV I love thy habitation, Lord, The temple where thine honours dwell; There shall I hear thine holy word, And there thy works of wonder tell. V Let not my soul be join'd at last With men of treachery and blood, Since I my days on earth have past Among the saints, and near my God. PSALM 27. v. 1–6. First Part. (C. M.) The Church is our Delight and Safety. I The Lord of glory is my light, And my salvation too; God is my strength, nor will I fear What all my foes can do. II One privilege my heart desires; O grant me an abode Among the churches of thy saints, The temples of my God! III There shall I offer my requests, And see thy beauty still, Shall hear thy messages of love, And there enquire thy will. IV When troubles rise, and storms appear, There may his children hide: God has a strong pavilion where He makes my soul abide. V Now shall my head be lifted high Above my foes around, And songs of joy and victory Within thy temple sound. PSALM 27. v. 8, 9, 13, 14. Second Part. (C. M.) Prayer and Hope. I Soon as I heard my Father say, ‘Ye children seek my grace,’ My heart reply'd without delay, ‘I'll seek my Father's face.’ II Let not thy face be hid from me, Nor frown my soul away; God of my life, I fly to thee In a distressing day. III Should friends and kindred near and dear Leave me to want, or die, My God would make my life his care, And all my need supply. IV My fainting flesh had dy'd with grief, Had not my soul believ'd To see thy grace provide relief, Nor was my hope deceiv'd. V Wait on the Lord, ye trembling saints, And keep your courage up; He'll raise your spirit when it faints, And far exceed your hope. The xxviiith psalm has scarcely any thing new, but what is repeated in other psalms. PSALM 29. (L. M.) Storm and Thunder. I Give to the Lord, ye sons of fame, Give to the Lord renown and power, Ascribe due honours to his name, And his eternal might adore. II The Lord proclaims his power aloud Over the ocean and the land; His voice divides the watery cloud, And lightnings blaze at his command. III He speaks, and tempest, hail, and wind, Lay the wide forest bare around; The fearful hart, and frighful hind, Leap at the terror of the sound. IV To Lebanon he turns his voice, And lo, the stately cedars break; The mountains tremble at the noise, The vallies roar, the deserts quake. V The Lord sits sovereign on the flood, The thunderer reigns for ever king; But makes his church his blest abode, Where we his awful glories sing. VI In gentler language there the Lord The counsels of his grace imparts; Amidst the raging storm his word Speaks peace and courage to our hearts. PSALM 30. First Part. (L. M.) Sickness healed and Sorrow removed. I I will extol thee, Lord, on high, At thy command diseases fly; Who but a God can speak and save From the dark borders of the grave? II Sing to the Lord, ye saints of his, And tell how large his goodness is; Let all your powers rejoice and bless, While you record his holiness. III His anger but a moment stays; His love is life and length of days; Though grief and tears the night employ, The morning-star restores the joy. PSALM 30. v. 6. Second Part. (L. M.) Health, Sickness, and Recovery. I Firm was my health, my day was bright, And I presum'd 'twould ne'er be night; Fondly I said within my heart, ‘Pleasure and peace shall ne'er depart.’ II But I forgot thine arm was strong, Which made my mountain stand so long; Soon as thy face began to hide, My health was gone, my comforts dy'd. III I cry'd aloud to thee, my God, ‘What canst thou profit by my blood? ‘Deep in the dust can I declare ‘Thy truth, or sing thy goodness there? IV ‘Hear me, O God of grace,’ I said, ‘And bring me from among the dead:’ Thy word rebuk'd the pains I felt, Thy pardoning love remov'd my guilt. V My groans, and tears, and forms of woe, Are turn'd to joy and praises now; I throw my sackcloth on the ground, And ease and gladness gird me round. VI My tongue, the glory of my frame, Shall ne'er be silent of thy name; Thy praise shall sound thro' earth and heaven, For sickness heal'd and sins forgiven. PSALM 31. v. 5, 13–19, 22, 23. First Part. (C. M.) Deliverance from Death. I Into thine hand, O God of truth, My spirit I commit; Thou hast redeem'd my soul from death, And sav'd me from the pit. II The passions of my hope and fear Maintain'd a doubtful strife, While sorrow, pain, and sin conspir'd To take away my life. III ‘My times are in thy hand,’ I cry'd, ‘Though I draw near the dust;’ Thou art the refuge where I hide, The God in whom I trust. IV O make thy reconciled face Upon thy servant shine, And save me for thy mercy's sake, For I'm entirely thine. V 'Twas in my haste, my spirit said, ‘I must despair and die, ‘I am cut off before thine eyes;’ But thou hast heard my cry. VI Thy goodness how divinely free! How wondrous is thy grace To those that fear thy majesty, And trust thy promises! VII O love the Lord, all ye his saints, And sing his praises loud; He'll bend his ear to your complaints, And recompense the proud. PSALM 31. v. 7–13, 18–21. Second Part. (C. M.) Deliverance from Slander and Reproach. I My heart rejoices in thy name, My God, my help, my trust; Thou hast preserv'd my face from shame, Mine honour from the dust. II ‘My life is spent with grief,’ I cry'd, ‘My years consum'd in groans, ‘My strength decays, mine eyes are dry'd, ‘And sorrow wastes my bones.’ III Among mine enemies my name Was a mere proverb grown, While to my neighbours I became Forgotten and unknown. IV Slander and fear, on every side, Seiz'd and beset me round; I to the throne of grace apply'd, And speedy rescue found. V How great deliverance thou hast wrought Before the sons of men! The lying lips to silence brought, And made their boastings vain! VI Thy children, from the strife of tongues, Shall thy pavilion hide, Guard them from infamy and wrongs, And crush the sons of pride. VII Within thy secret presence, Lord, Let me for ever dwell; No fenced city, wall'd and barr'd, Secures a saint so well. I have much transposed the parts of this psalm, that I might unite the verses of the same sense and subject nearer together, and contract them into two divine hymns. PSALM 32. (S. M.) Forgiveness of Sins upon Confession. I O blessed souls are they Whose sins are cover'd o'er! Divinely blest, to whom the Lord Imputes their guilt no more! II They mourn their follies past, And keep their hearts with care; Their lips and lives, without deceit, Shall prove their faith sincere. III While I conceal'd my guilt I felt the fest'ring wound, 'Till I confess'd my sins to thee, And ready pardon found. IV Let sinners learn to pray, Let saints keep near the throne; Our help, in times of deep distress, Is found in God alone. PSALM 32. (C. M.) Free Pardon and sincere Obedience; or, Confession and Forgiveness. I Happy the man to whom his God No more imputes his sin, But, wash'd in the Redeemer's blood, Hath made his garments clean! II Happy, beyond expression, he Whose debts are thus discharg'd; And, from the guilty bondage free, He feels his soul enlarg'd. III His spirit hates deceit and lies, His words are all sincere; He guards his heart, he guards his eyes, To keep his conscience clear. IV While I my inward guilt supprest, No quiet could I find; Thy wrath lay burning in my breast, And rack'd my tortur'd mind. V Then I confess'd my troubled thoughts, My secret sins reveal'd; Thy pardoning grace forgave my faults, Thy grace my pardon seal'd. VI This shall invite thy saints to pray; When, like a raging flood, Temptations rise, our strength and stay Is a forgiving God. PSALM 32. First Part. (L. M.) Repentance and free Pardon; or, Justification and Sanctification. I Blest is the man, for ever blest, Whose guilt is pardon'd by his God, Whose sins with sorrow are confess'd, And cover'd with his Saviour's blood. II Blest is the man to whom the Lord Imputes not his iniquities, He pleads no merit of reward, And not on works, but grace relies. III From guile his heart and lips are free, His humble joy, his holy fear, With deep repentance well agree, And join to prove his faith sincere. IV How glorious is that righteousness That hides and cancels all his sins! While a bright evidence of grace Thro' his whole life appears and shines. The first two verses of this psalm being cited by the apostle in the fourth chapter of Romans, to shew the freedom of our pardon and justification by grace without works, I have in this version of it enlarged the sense, by mention of the blood of Christ, and faith and repentance; and, because the psalmist adds, a spirit in which is no guile, I have inserted that sincere obedience, which is a scriptural evidence of our faith and justification. PSALM 32. Second Part. (L. M.) A guilty Conscience eased by Confession and Pardon. I While I keep silence, and conceal My heavy guilt within my heart, What torments doth my conscience feel! What agonies of inward smart! II I spread my sins before the Lord, And all my secret faults confess; Thy gospel speaks a pardoning word, Thine holy Spirit seals the grace. III For this shall every humble soul Make swift addresses to thy seat; When floods of huge temptations roll, There shall they find a blest retreat. IV How safe beneath thy wings I lie, When days grow dark, and storms appear! And when I walk, thy watchful eye Shall guide me safe from every snare. PSALM 33. First Part. (C. M.) Works of Creation and Providence. I Rejoice, ye righteous, in the Lord This work belongs to you: Sing of his name, his ways, his word, How holy, just, and true! II His mercy and his righteousness Let heaven and earth proclaim; His works of nature and of grace Reveal his wondrous name. III His wisdom and almighty word The heavenly arches spread; And by the Spirit of the Lord Their shining hosts were made. IV He bid the liquid waters flow To their appointed deep; The flowing seas their limits know, And their own station keep. V Ye tenants of the spacious earth, With fear before him stand; He spake, and nature took its birth, And rests on his command. VI He scorns the angry nations' rage, And breaks their vain designs; His counsel stands through every age, And in full glory shines. PSALM 33. Second Part. (C. M.) Creatures vain, and God all-sufficient. I Blest is the nation where the Lord Hath fix'd his gracious throne; Where he reveals his heavenly word, And calls their tribes his own. II His eye, with infinite survey, Does the whole world behold; He form'd us all of equal clay, And knows our feeble mould. III Kings are not rescu'd by the force Of armies from the grave; Nor speed nor courage of an horse Can the bold rider save. IV Vain is the strength of beasts or men To hope for safety thence; But holy souls from God obtain A strong and sure defence. V God is their fear, and God their trust; When plagues or famine spread, His watchful eye secures the just Among ten thousand dead. VI Lord, let our hearts in thee rejoice, And bless us from thy throne; For we have made thy word our choice, And trust thy grace alone. PSALM 33. First Part. As the 113th Psalm Works of Creation and Providence. I Ye holy souls, in God rejoice, Your Maker's praise becomes your voice; Great is your theme, your songs be new: Sing of his name, his word, his ways, His works of nature and of grace, How wise and holy, just and true! II Justice and truth he ever loves, And the whole earth his goodness proves, His word the heavenly arches spread; How wide they shine from north to south! And by the spirit of his mouth Were all the starry armies made. III He gathers the wide-flowing seas, Those watery treasures know their place, In the vast store-house of the deep: He spake, and gave all nature birth; And fires, and seas, and heaven, and earth, His everlasting orders keep. IV Let mortals tremble and adore A God of such resistless power, Nor dare indulge their feeble rage: Vain are your thoughts, and weak your hands; But his eternal counsel stands, And rules the world from age to age. PSALM 33. Second Part. As the 113th Psalm. Creatures vain, and God all-sufficient. I O happy nation, where the Lord Reveals the treasure of his word, And builds his church, his earthly throne! His eye the heathen world surveys, He form'd their hearts, he knows their ways; But God their Maker is unknown. II Let kings rely upon their host, And of his strength the champion boast; In vain they boast, in vain rely; In vain we trust the brutal force, Or speed, or courage of an horse, To guard his rider, or to fly. III The eye of thy compassion, Lord, Doth more secure defence afford, When death or dangers threat'ning stand: Thy watchful eye preserves the just, Who make thy name their fear and trust, When wars or famine waste the land. IV In sickness or the bloody field, Thou our physician, thou our shield, Send us salvation from thy throne; We wait to see thy goodness shine; Let us rejoice in help divine, For all our hope is God alone. PSALM 34. First Part. (L. M.) God's Care of the Saints; or, Deliverance by Prayer. I Lord, I will bless thee all my days, Thy praise shall dwell upon my tongue; My soul shall glory in thy grace, While saints rejoice to hear the song. II Come, magnify the Lord with me, Come, let us all exalt his name; I sought th'eternal God, and he Has not expos'd my hope to shame. III I told him all my secret grief, My secret groaning reach'd his ears; He gave my inward pains relief, And calm'd the tumult of my fears. IV To him the poor lift up their eyes, Their faces feel the heavenly shine; A beam of mercy from the skies Fills them with light and joy divine. V His holy angels pitch their tents Around the men that serve the Lord; O fear and love him, all his saints, Taste of his grace and trust his word. VI The wild young lions, pinch'd with pain And hunger, roar thro' all the wood; But none shall seek the Lord in vain, Nor want supplies of real good. PSALM 34. v. 11–22. Second Part. (L. M.) Religious Education; or, Instructions of Piety. I Children in years and knowledge young, Your parents' hope, your parents' joy, Attend the counsels of my tongue, Let pious thoughts your minds employ. II If you desire a length of days, And peace to crown your mortal state, Restrain your feet from impious ways, Your lips from slander and deceit. III The eyes of God regard his saints, His ears are open to their cries; He sets his frowning face against The sons of violence and lies. IV To humble souls and broken hearts God with his grace is ever nigh; Pardon and hope his love imparts When men in deep contrition lie. V He tells their tears, he counts their groans, His Son redeems their souls from death; His Spirit heals their broken bones, They in his praise employ their breath. PSALM 34. v. 1–10. First Part. (C. M.) Prayer and Praise for eminent Deliverance. I I'll bless the Lord from day to day; How good are all his ways! Ye humble souls that use to pray, Come, help my lips to praise! II Sing to the honour of his name, How a poor sufferer cry'd, Nor was his hope expos'd to shame, Nor was his suit deny'd. III When threatening sorrows round me stood, And endless fears arose, Like the loud billows of a flood, Redoubling all my woes; IV I told the Lord my sore distress With heavy groans and tears, He gave my sharpest torments ease, And silenc'd all my fears. V O sinners, come and taste his love, Come, learn his pleasant ways, And let your own experience prove The sweetness of his grace. VI He bids his angels pitch their tents Round where his children dwell; What ills their heavenly care prevents, No earthly tongue can tell. VII O love the Lord, ye saints of his; His eye regards the just; How richly bless'd their portion is Who make the Lord their trust! VIII Young lions pinch'd with hunger roar, And famish in the wood; But God supplies his holy poor With every needful good. PSALM 34. v. 11–22. Second Part. (C. M.) Exhortations to Peace and Holiness. I Come, children, learn to fear the Lord; And that your days be long, Let not a false or spiteful word Be found upon your tongue. II Depart from mischief, practise love, Pursue the works of peace; So shall the Lord your ways approve, And set your souls at ease. III His eyes awake to guard the just, His ears attend their cry; When broken spirits dwell in dust, The God of grace is nigh. IV What tho' the sorrows here they taste Are sharp and tedious too, The Lord, who saves them all at last, Is their supporter now. V Evil shall smite the wicked dead; But God secures his own, Prevents the mischief when they slide, Or heals the broken bone. VI When desolation like a flood O'er the proud sinner rolls, Saints find a refuge in their God, For he redeem'd their souls. PSALM 35. v. 1–9. First Part. (C. M.) Prayer and Faith of persecuted Saints; or, Imprecations mixed with Charity. I Now plead my cause, almighty God, With all the sons of strife; And fight against the men of blood Who fight against my life. II Draw out thy spear and stop their way, Lift thine avenging rod; But to my soul in mercy say, ‘I am thy Saviour God.’ III They plant their snares to catch my feet, And nets of mischief spread; Plunge the destroyers in the pit That their own hands have made. IV Let fogs and darkness hide their way, And slippery be their ground; Thy wrath shall make their lives a prey, And all their rage confound. V They fly like chaff before the wind, Before thine angry breath; The angel of the Lord behind Pursues them down to death. VI They love the road that leads to hell; Among the imprecations that David uses against his adversaries in this psalm, I have endeavoured to turn the edge of some of them away from personal enemies against the implacable enemies of God in the world. Then let the rebels die, Whose malice is implacable Against the Lord on high. VII But if thou hast a chosen few Agreeably to the spirit of the gospel, I have here further molified these imprecations by a charitable distinction and petition for their souls; which spirit of evangelic charity appears so conspicuous in the 12, 13, and 14th verses of the psalm, that I could not forbear to form them into a short distinct hymn, enlarging on that glorious character of a christian, love to our enemies, commanded so particularly, and so divinely exemplified by Christ himself. Amongst that impious race, Divide them from the bloody crew By thy surprising grace. VIII Then will I raise my tuneful voice Agreeably to the spirit of the gospel, I have here further molified these imprecations by a charitable distinction and petition for their souls; which spirit of evangelic charity appears so conspicuous in the 12, 13, and 14th verses of the psalm, that I could not forbear to form them into a short distinct hymn, enlarging on that glorious character of a christian, love to our enemies, commanded so particularly, and so divinely exemplified by Christ himself. To make thy wonders known; In their salvation I'll rejoice, And bless thee for my own. PSALM 35. v. 12–14. Second Part. (C. M.) Love to Enemies; or, the Love of Christ to Sinners typified in David. I Behold the love, the generous love That holy David shows; Hark how his sounding bowels move To his afflicted foes! II When they are sick his soul complains, And seems to feel the smart; The spirit of the gospel reigns, And melts his pious heart. III How did his flowing tears condole As for a brother dead! And fasting mortify'd his soul, While for their life he pray'd. IV They groan'd; and curs'd him on their bed, Yet still he pleads and mourns; And double blessings on his head The righteous God returns. V O glorious type of heavenly grace! Thus Christ the Lord appears; While sinners curse, the Saviour prays, And pities them with tears. VI He, the true David, Israel's king, Blest and belov'd of God, To save us rebels, dead in sin, Paid his own dearest blood. See the notes on the first part of this psalm. Stanza i. Sounding of the bowels is a scriptural metaphor, Isaiah lxiii. 15. PSALM 36. v. 5–9. (L. M.) The Perfections and Providence of God; or, general Providence and special Grace. I High in the heavens, eternal God, Thy goodness in full glory shines; Thy truth shall break thro' every cloud That veils and darkens thy designs. II For ever firm thy justice stands, As mountains their foundations keep; Wise are the wonders of thy hands; Thy judgments are a mighty deep. III Thy providence is kind and large, Both man and beast thy bounty share; The whole creation is thy charge, But saints are thy peculiar care. IV My God! how excellent thy grace, Whence all our hope and comfort springs! The sons of Adam in distress Fly to the shadow of thy wings. V From the provisions of thy house We shall be fed with sweet repast; There mercy like a river flows, And brings salvation to our taste. VI Life, like a fountain rich and free, Springs from the presence of the Lord; And in thy light our souls shall see The glories promis'd in thy word. PSALM 36. v. 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9. (C. M.) Practical Atheism exposed; or, the Being and Attributes of God asserted. I While men grow bold in wicked ways, And yet a God they own, My heart within me often says, ‘Their thoughts believe there's none.’ II Their thoughts and ways at once declare (Whate'er their lips profess) God hath no wrath for them to fear, Nor will they seek his grace. III What strange self-flattery blinds their eyes! But there's an hast'ning hour When they shall see with sore surprise The terrors of thy power. IV Thy justice shall maintain its throne, Tho' mountains melt away; Thy judgments are a world unknown, A deep unfathom'd sea. V Above the heavens created rounds, Thy mercies, Lord, extend; Thy truth outlives the narrow bounds Where time and nature end. VI Safety to man thy goodness brings, Nor overlooks the beast; Beneath the shadow of thy wings Thy children choose to rest. VII From thee, when creature-streams run low, And mortal comforts die, Perpetual springs of life shall flow, And raise our pleasures high. VIII Tho' all created light decay, And death close up our eyes, Thy presence makes eternal day Where clouds can never rise. PSALM 36. v. 1–7. (S. M.) The Wickedness of Man, and the Majesty of God; or, practical Atheism exposed. I When man grows bold in sin, My heart within me cries, ‘He hath no faith of God within, ‘Nor fear before his eyes.’ II He walks a while conceal'd In a self-flattering dream, Till his dark crimes at once reveal'd Expose his hateful name. III His heart is false and foul, His words are smooth and fair; Wisdom is banish'd from his soul, And leaves no goodness there. IV He plots upon his bed New mischiefs to fulfil; He sets his heart, and hand, and head, To practise all that's ill. V But there's a dreadful God, Tho' men renounce his fear; His justice hid behind the cloud Shall one great day appear. VI His truth transcends the sky; In heaven his mercies dwell; Deep as the sea his judgments lie, His anger burns to hell. VII How excellent his love, Whence all our safety springs! O never let my soul remove From underneath his wings. PSALM 37. v. 1–15. First Part. (C. M.) The Cure of Envy, Fretfulness, and Unbelief; or, the Rewards of the Righteous and the Wicked; or, the World's Hatred, and the Saint's Patience. I Why should I vex my soul, and fret To see the wicked rise? Or envy sinners waxing great, By violence and lies? II As flowery grass cut down at noon, Before the evening fades, So shall their glories vanish soon In everlasting shades. III Then let me make the Lord my trust, And practise all that's good; So shall I dwell among the just, And he'll provide me food. IV I to my God my ways commit, And cheerful wait his will; Thy hand, which guides my doubtful feet, Shall my desires fulfil. V Mine innocence shalt thou display, And make thy judgments known, Fair as the light of dawning day, And glorious as the noon. VI The meek at last the earth possess, And are the heirs of heaven; True riches with abundant peace, To humble souls are given. VII Rest in the Lord and keep his way, Nor let your anger rise, Tho' providence should long delay To punish haughty vice. VIII Let sinners join to break your peace, And plot, and rage, and foam: The Lord derides them, for he sees Their day of vengeance come. IX They have drawn out the threatening sword, Have bent the murderous bow, To slay the men that fear the Lord And bring the righteous low. X My God shall break their bows, and burn Their persecuting darts, Shall their own swords against them turn, And pain surprise their hearts. I have turned the divine instructions at the beginning of this psalm into the form of holy purposes, as more affecting and lively. PSALM 37. v. 16, 21, 26–31. Second Part. (C. M.) Charity to the Poor; or, Religion in Words and Deeds. I Why do the wealthy wicked boast, And grow profanely bold? The meanest portion of the just Excels the sinner's gold. II The wicked borrows of his friends, But ne'er designs to pay; The saint is merciful and lends, Nor turns the poor away. III His alms with liberal heart he gives Amongst the sons of need; His memory to long ages lives, And blessed is his seed. IV His lips abhor to talk prophane, To slander or defraud; His ready tongue declares to men What he has learn'd of God. V The law and gospel of the Lord Deep in his heart abide; Led by the Spirit and the word, His feet shall never slide. VI When sinners fall, the righteous stand, Preserv'd from every snare; They shall possess the promis'd land, And dwell for ever there. PSALM 37. v. 23–37. Third Part. (C. M.) The Way and End of the Righteous and the Wicked. I My God, the steps of pious men Are order'd by thy will; Tho' they should fall they rise again, Thy hand supports them still. II The Lord delights to see their ways, Their virtue he approves; He'll ne'er deprive them of his grace, Nor leave the men he loves. III The heavenly heritage is their's, Their portion and their home; He feeds them now, and makes them heirs Of blessings long to come. IV Wait on the Lord, ye sons of men, Nor fear when tyrants frown; Ye shall confess their pride was vain, When justice casts them down. V The haughty sinner have I seen, Nor fearing man nor God, Like a tall bay-tree fair and green, Spreading his arms abroad. VI And lo! he vanish'd from the ground, Destroy'd by hands unseen; Nor root, nor branch, nor leaf was found Where all that pride had been. VII But mark the man of righteousness, His several steps attend; True pleasure runs through all his ways, And peaceful is his end. This long psalm abounds with useful instructions and encouragements to piety, but the verses are very much unconnected and independent; therefore I have contracted and transposed them, so as to reduce them to three hymns of a moderate length, and with some connection of the sense. PSALM 38. (C. M.) Guilt of Conscience and Relief; or, Repentance, and Prayer for Pardon and Health. I Amidst thy wrath remember love, Restore thy servant, Lord; Nor let a Father's chastening prove Like an avenger's sword. II Thine arrows stick within my heart, My flesh is sorely prest; Between the sorrow and the smart My spirit finds no rest. III My sins a heavy load appear, And o'er my head are gone; Too heavy they for me to bear, Too hard for me t'atone. IV My thoughts are like a troubled sea, My head still bending down; And I go mourning all the day Beneath my Father's frown. V Lord, I am weak, and broken sore, None of my powers are whole; The inward anguish makes me roar, The anguish of my soul. VI All my desire to thee is known, Thine eye counts every tear, And every sigh, and every groan Is noticed by thine ear. VII Thou art my God, my only hope; My God will hear my cry, My God will bear my spirit up, When Satan bids me die. VIII My foot is ever apt to slide, My foes rejoice to see 't; They raise their pleasure and their pride, When they supplant my feet. IX But I'll confess my guilt to thee, And grieve for all my sin, I'll mourn how weak my graces be, And beg support divine. X My God, forgive my follies past, And be for ever nigh; O Lord of my salvation, haste, Before thy servant die. PSALM 39. v. 1–3. First Part. (C. M.) Watchfulness over the Tongue; or, Prudence and Zeal. I Thus I resolv'd before the Lord, ‘Now will I watch my tongue, ‘Lest I let slip one sinful word, ‘Or do my neighbour wrong.’ II And if I'm e'er constrain'd to stay With men of lives profane, I'll set a double guard that day, Nor let my talk be vain. III I'll scarce allow my lips to speak The pious thoughts I feel, Lest scoffers should th'occasion take To mock my holy zeal. IV Yet if some proper hour appear, I'll not be overaw'd, But let the scoffing sinners hear That I can speak for God. I have not confined myself here to the sense of the psalmist, but have taken occasion, from the three first verses, to write a short hymn on the government of the tongue. PSALM 39. v. 4–7. Second Part. (C. M.) The Vanity of Man as Mortal. I Teach me the measure of my days, Thou maker of my frame; I would survey life's narrow space, And learn how frail I am. II A span is all that we can boast, An inch or two of time; Man is but vanity and dust In all his flower and prime. III See the vain race of mortals move Like shadows o'er the plain, They rage and strive, desire and love, But all the noise is vain. IV Some walk in honour's gaudy show, Some dig for golden ore, They toil for heirs they know not who, And straight are seen no more. V What should I wish or wait for then From creatures, earth and dust? They make our expectations vain, And disappoint our trust. VI Now I forbid my carnal hope, My fond desires recall; I give my mortal interest up, And make my God my all. PSALM 39. v. 9–13. Third Part. (C. M.) Sick-bed Devotion; or, pleading without repining. I God of my life, look gently down, Behold the pains I feel; But I am dumb before thy throne, Nor dare dispute thy will. II Diseases are thy servants, Lord, They come at thy command; I'll not attempt a murmuring word, Against thy chastening hand. III Yet I may plead with humble cries, Remove thy sharp rebukes; My strength consumes, my spirit dies Through thy repeated strokes. IV Crush'd as a moth beneath thy hand, We moulder to the dust; Our feeble powers can ne'er withstand, And all our beauty's lost. V This mortal life decays apace, How soon the bubble's broke! Adam and all his numerous race Are vanity and smoke. VI I'm but a sojourner below As all my fathers were, May I be well prepar'd to go When I the summons hear. VII But if my life be spar'd awhile, Before my last remove, Thy praise shall be my business still, And I'll declare thy love. PSALM 40. v. 1, 2, 3, 5, 17. First Part. (C. M.) A Song of Deliverance from great Distress. I I waited patient for the Lord, He bow'd to hear my cry; He saw me resting on his word, And brought salvation nigh. II He rais'd me from a horrid pit Where mourning long I lay, And from my bonds releas'd my feet, Deep bonds of miry clay. III Firm on a rock he made me stand, And taught my cheerful tongue To praise the wonders of his hand, In a new thankful song. IV I'll spread his works of grace abroad; The saints with joy shall hear, And sinners learn to make my God Their only hope and fear. V How many are thy thoughts of love! Thy mercies, Lord, how great! We have not words nor hours enough Their numbers to repeat. VI When I'm afflicted, poor and low, And light and peace depart, My God beholds my heavy woe, And bears me on his heart. PSALM 40. v. 6–9. Second Part. (C. M.) The Incarnation and Sacrifice of Christ. I Thus saith the Lord, ‘Your work is vain, ‘Give your burnt offerings o'er, ‘In dying goats and bullocks slain ‘My soul delights no more.’ II Then spake the Saviour, ‘Lo, I'm here, ‘My God, to do thy will; ‘Whate'er thy sacred books declare, ‘Thy servant shall fulfil. III ‘Thy law is ever in my sight, ‘I keep it near my heart; ‘Mine ears are open'd with delight ‘To what thy lips impart.’ IV And see, the bless'd Redeemer comes, Th'eternal Son appears, And at th'appointed time assumes The body God prepares. V Much he reveal'd his Father's grace, And much his truth he shew'd, And preach'd the way of righteousness, Where great assemblies stood. VI His Father's honour touch'd his heart, He pity'd sinners' cries, And, to fulfil a Saviour's part, Was made a sacrifice. VII No blood of beasts on altars shed Could wash the conscience clean; But the rich sacrifice he paid Atones for all our sin. VIII Then was the great salvation spread, And Satan's kingdom shook; Thus by the woman's promis'd seed The serpent's head was broke. If David had written this psalm in the days of the gospel, surely he would have given a much more express and particular account of the sacrifice of Christ, as he hath done of his preaching, verse 9, 10. and enlarged as Paul doth in Heb. x. 4, &amp;c. where this psalm is cited. I have done no more therefore in this paraphrase, than what I am persuaded the psalmist himself would have done in the time of christianity. The scriptures which I have used here on this occasion, are, Heb. x. 4. It is not possible the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sin. verse 5. A body hast thou prepared me. John vii. 18. I seek the glory of him that sent me. Heb. x. 26. He appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. Gen. iii. 15. The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head. PSALM 40. v. 5–10. (L. M.) Christ our Sacrifice. I The wonders, Lord, thy love has wrought, Exceed our praise, surmount our thought; Should I attempt the long detail, My speech would faint, my numbers fail. II No blood of beasts on altars spilt Can cleanse the souls of men from guilt; But thou hast set before our eyes An all-sufficient sacrifice. III Lo! thine eternal Son appears, To thy designs he bows his ears, Assumes a body well prepar'd, And well performs a work so hard. IV ‘Behold, I come,’ (the Saviour cries, With love and duty in his eyes) ‘I come to bear the heavy load ‘Of sins, and do thy will, my God. V ‘'Tis written in thy great decree, ‘'Tis in thy book foretold of me, ‘I must fulfil the Saviour's part, ‘And lo! thy law is in my heart! VI ‘I'll magnify thy holy law, ‘And rebels to obedience draw, ‘When on my cross I'm lifted high, ‘Or to my crown above the sky. VII ‘The Spirit shall descend, and show ‘What thou hast done, and what I do; ‘The wondering world shall learn thy grace, ‘Thy wisdom and thy righteousness.’ Besides some of the scriptures mentioned under the former metre, I have here made use of these also, 1 John iii. 5. The Son of God was manifested, &amp;c. 1 Pet. ii. 24. He bore our sins. Isaiah xlii. 21. He will magnify the law, and make it honourable. John xii. 32. If I be lifted up, I will draw all men to me. John xvi. 14. The Spirit shall receive of mine, and shew it unto you. PSALM 41. v. 1–3. (L. M.) Charity to the Poor; or, Pity to the Afflicted. I Blest is the man whose bowels move And melt with pity to the poor, Whose soul, by sympathizing love, Feels what his fellow-saints endure. II His heart contrives for their relief More good than his own hands can do; He, in the time of general grief, Shall find the Lord has bowels too. III His soul shall live secure on earth, With secret blessings on his head, When drought, and pestilence and dearth Around him multiply their dead. IV Or, if he languish on his couch, God will pronounce his sins forgiven, Will save him with a healing touch, Or take his willing soul to heaven. The last ten verses of this psalm are of quite another subject, relating to David's personal enemies, which being so frequently repeated, I have often omitted. The positive blessings of long life, health, recovery, and security, in the midst of dangers, being so much promised in the Old Testament, and so little in the New, I have given a turn at the end of this hymn, to discourage a too confident expectation of these temporal things, and led the soul to heavenly hopes, more agreeable to the gospel. PSALM 42. v. 1–5. First Part. (C. M.) Desertion and Hope; or, Complaint of Absence from Public Worship. I With earnest longings of the mind, My God, to thee I look; So pants the hunted hart to find And taste the cooling brook. II When shall I see thy courts of grace, And meet my God again? So long an absence from thy face My heart endures with pain. III Temptations vex my weary soul, And tears are my repast; The foe insults without control, ‘And where's your God at last?’ IV 'Tis with a mournful pleasure now I think on ancient days; Then to thy house did numbers go, And all our work was praise. V But why, my soul, sunk down so far Beneath this heavy load? Why do my thoughts indulge despair, And sin against my God? VI Hope in the Lord, whose mighty hand Can all thy woes remove; For I shall yet before him stand, And sing restoring love. PSALM 42. v. 6–11. Second Part. (L. M.) Melancholy Thoughts reproved; or, Hope in Afflictions. I My spirit sinks within me, Lord, But I will call thy name to mind, And times of past distress record, When I have found my God was kind. II Huge troubles, with tumultuous noise, Swell like a sea, and round me spread; Thy water spouts drown all my joys, And rising waves roll o'er my head. III Yet will the Lord, command his love, When I address his throne by day, Nor in the night his grace remove; The night shall hear me sing and pray. IV I'll cast myself before his feet, And say, ‘My God, my heavenly rock, ‘Why doth thy love so long forget ‘The soul that groans beneath thy stroke?’ V I'll chide my heart that sinks so low, Why should my soul indulge her grief? Hope in the Lord and praise him too, He is my rest, my sure relief. VI Thy light and truth shall guide me still, Thy word shall my best thoughts employ, And lead me to thine heavenly hill, My God, my most exceeding joy. The 43d Psalm is so near akin to this, that I have omitted it, only borrowing the third and fourth verses to conclude this hymn. PSALM 44. v. 1–3, 8, 15–26. (C. M.) The Church's Complaint in Persecution. I Lord, we have heard thy works of old, Thy works of power and grace, When to our ears our fathers told The wonders of their days: II How thou didst build thy churches here, And make thy gospel known; Amongst them did thine arm appear, Thy light and glory shone. III In God they boasted all the day, And in a cheerful throng Did thousands meet to praise and pray, And grace was all their song. IV But now our souls are seiz'd with shame, Confusion fills our face, To hear the enemy blaspheme, And fools reproach thy grace. V Yet have we not forgot our God, Nor falsely dealt with heaven, Nor have our steps declin'd the road Of duty thou hast given; VI Tho' dragons all around us roar With their destructive breath, And thine own hand has bruis'd us sore Hard by the gates of death. VII We are expos'd all day to die As martyrs for thy cause, As sheep for slaughter bound we lie By sharp and bloody laws. VIII Awake, arise, almighty Lord, Why sleeps thy wonted grace? Why should we look like men abhorr'd, Or banish'd from thy face? IX Wilt thou for ever cast us off, And still neglect our cries? For ever hide thine heavenly love From our afflicted eyes? X Down to the dust our soul is bow'd, And dies upon the ground; Rise for our help, rebuke the proud, And all their powers confound. XI Redeem us from perpetual shame, Our Saviour and our God; We plead the honours of thy name, The merits of thy blood. PSALM 45. (S. M.) The Glory of Christ; the Success of the Gospel; and the Gentile Church. I My Saviour and my King, Thy beauties are divine; Thy lips with blessings overflow, And every grace is thine. II Now make thy glory known, Gird on thy dreadful sword, And ride in majesty to spread The conquests of thy word. III Strike thro' thy stubborn foes, Or melt their hearts t'obey, While justice, meekness, grace and truth Attend thy glorious way. IV Thy laws, O God, are right; Thy throne shall ever stand; And thy victorious gospel proves A sceptre in thy hand. V Thy Father and thy God John iii. 34. God giveth not the spirit by measure unto him. Hath without measure shed His Spirit, like a joyful oil, T'anoint thy sacred head. VI Behold, at thy right hand The gentile church is seen, Like a fair bride in rich attire, And princes guard the queen. VII Fair bride, receive his love, Forget thy Father's house; Forsake thy gods, thy idol-gods, And pay thy Lord thy vows. VIII O let thy God and King Thy sweetest thoughts employ; Thy children shall his honours sing In palaces of joy. This psalm is a description of the personal glories of Christ, and the success of his gospel; and probably it refers to the gentile Church, because she is bid to forget her Father's house; all under the type of Solomon's marriage to Pharoah's daughter. PSALM 45. (C. M.) The Personal Glories and Government of Christ. I I'll speak the honours of my king, His form divinely fair; None of the sons of mortal race May with the Lord compare. II Sweet is thy speech, and heavenly grace Upon thy lips is shed; Thy God, with blessings infinite, Hath crown'd thy sacred head. III Gird on thy sword, victorious Prince, Ride with majestic sway; Thy terrors shall strike through thy foes, And make the world obey. VI Thy throne, O God, for ever stands; Thy word of grace shall prove A peaceful sceptre in thy hands, To rule the saints by love. V Justice and truth attend thee still, But mercy is thy choice; And God, thy God, thy soul shall fill With most peculiar joys. PSALM 45. First Part. (L. M.) The Glory of Christ, and Power of his Gospel. I Now be my heart inspir'd to sing The glories of my Saviour-king, Jesus the Lord; how heavenly fair His form! how bright his beauties are! II O'er all the sons of human race He shines with a superior grace, Love from his lips divinely flows, And blessings all his state compose. III Dress thee in arms, most mighty Lord, Gird on the terror of thy sword, In majesty and glory ride With truth and meekness at thy side. IV Thine anger, like a pointed dart, Shall pierce the foes of stubborn heart; Or words of mercy kind and sweet Shall melt the rebels at thy feet. V Thy throne, O God, for ever stands, Grace is the sceptre in thy hands; Thy laws and works are just and right, Justice and grace are thy delight. VI God, thine own God, has richly shed His oil of gladness on thy head, And with his sacred Spirit blest His first-born Son above the rest. PSALM 45. Second Part. (L. M.) Christ and his Church; or, the Mystical Marriage. I The King of saints, how fair his face, Adorn'd with majesty and grace! He comes with blessings from above, And wins the nations to his love. II At his right hand our eyes behold The queen array'd in purest gold; The world admires her heavenly dress, Her robe of joy and righteousness. III He forms her beauties like his own; He calls and seats her near his throne: Fair stranger, let thine heart forget The idols of thy native state. IV So shall the King the more rejoice; In thee, the favourite of his choice; Let him be lov'd and yet ador'd, For he's thy Maker and thy Lord. V O happy hour when thou shalt rise To his fair palace in the skies, And all thy sons (a numerous train) Each like a prince in glory reign! VI Let endless honours crown his head; Let every age his praises spread; While we with cheerful songs approve The condescensions of his love. PSALM 46. First Part. (L. M.) The Church's Safety, and Triumph among national Desolations. I God is the refuge of his saints, When storms of sharp distress invade; Ere we can offer our complaints Behold him present with his aid. II Let mountains from their seats be hurl'd Down to the deep, and buried there; Convulsions shake the solid world, Our faith shall never yield to fear. III Loud may the troubled ocean roar, In sacred peace our souls abide, While every nation, every shore, Trembles, and dreads the swelling tide. IV There is a stream whose gentle flow Supplies the city of our God; Life, love and joy, still gliding thro', And watering our divine abode. V That sacred stream, thine holy word, That all our raging fear controls: Sweet peace thy promises afford, And give new strength to fainting souls. VI Sion enjoys her monarch's love, Secure against a threatening hour; Nor can her firm foundations move, Built on his truth, and arm'd with power. PSALM 46. Second Part. (L. M.) God fights for his Church. I Let Sion in her king rejoice, Tho' tyrants rage and kingdoms rise; He utters his almighty voice, The nations melt, the tumult dies. II The Lord of old for Jacob fought, And Jacob's God is still our aid; Behold the works his hand has wrought, What desolations he has made! III From sea to sea, thro' all the shores He makes the noise of battle cease; When from on high his thunder roars, He awes the trembling world to peace. IV He breaks the bow, he cuts the spear, Chariots he burns with heavenly flame; Keep silence all the earth, and hear The sound and glory of his name. V ‘Be still, and learn that I am God, ‘I'll be exalted o'er the lands, ‘I will be known and fear'd abroad, ‘But still my throne in Sion stands.’ VI O Lord of hosts, almighty king, While we so near thy presence dwell, Our faith shall sit secure, and sing Defiance to the gates of hell. PSALM 47. (C. M.) Christ ascending and reigning. I O for a shout of sacred joy To God the sovereign King! Let every land their tongues employ, And hymns of triumph sing. II Jesus our God ascends on high, His heavenly guards around Attend him rising thro' the sky, With trumpet's joyful sound. III While angels shout and praise their King, Let mortals learn their strains; Let all the earth his honour sing; O'er all the earth he reigns. IV Rehearse his praise with awe profound, Let knowledge lead the song, Nor mock him with a solemn sound Upon a thoughtless tongue. V In Israel stood his ancient throne, He lov'd that chosen race; But now he calls the world his own, And heathens taste his grace. VI The British islands are the Lord's, There Abraham's God is known, While powers and princes, shields and swords, Submit before his throne. The ascent of Christ into heaven is typified in this psalm, by the ark brought up to Zion, 2 Sam. vi. 15. And the kingdom of Christ among the gentiles, is here represented by David's victory over the nations, verse 3. I have chosen to omit the type, and do honour to my ascending and reigning Saviour in more express language. PSALM 48. v. 1–8. First Part. (S. M.) The Church is the Honour and Safety of a Nation. I Great is the Lord our God, And let his praise be great; He makes his churches his abode, His most delightful seat. II These temples of his grace, How beautiful they stand! The honours of our native place, And bulwarks of our land. III In Sion God is known A refuge in distress; How bright has his salvation shone Through all her palaces! IV When kings against her join'd, And saw the Lord was there, In wild confusion of the mind They fled with hasty fear. V When navies tall and proud Attempt to spoil our peace, He sends his tempests roaring loud, And sinks them in the seas. VI Oft have our fathers told, Our eyes have often seen, How well our God secures the fold Where his own sheep have been. VII In every new distress We'll to his house repair, We'll think upon his wondrous grace, And seek deliverance there. PSALM 48. v. 10–14. Second Part. (S. M.) The Beauty of the Church; or, Gospel Worship and Order. I Far as thy name is known The world declares thy praise; Thy saints, O Lord, before thy throne Their songs of honour raise. II With joy let Judah stand On Sion's chosen hill, Proclaim the wonders of thy hand, And counsels of thy will. III Let strangers walk around The city where we dwell, Compass and view thine holy ground, And mark the building well; IV The orders of thy house, The worship of thy court, The cheerful songs, the solemn vows; And make a fair report. V How decent and how wise! How glorious to behold! Beyond the pomp that charms the eyes, And rites adorn'd with gold. VI The God we worship now Will guide us till we die, Will be our God while here below, And ours above the sky. PSALM 49. v. 6–14. First Part. (C. M.) Pride and Death; or, the Vanity of Life and Riches. I Why doth the man of riches grow To insolence and pride, To see his wealth and honours flow With every rising tide? II Why doth he treat the poor with scorn, Made of the self-same clay, And boast as tho' his flesh was born Of better dust than they? III Not all his treasures can procure His soul a short reprieve, Redeem from death one guilty hour, Or make his brother live. IV Life is a blessing can't be sold, The ransom is too high; Justice will ne'er be brib'd with gold That man may never die. V He sees the brutish and the wise, The timorous and the brave, Quit their possessions, close their eyes, And hasten to the grave. VI Yet 'tis his inward thought and pride,— ‘My house shall ever stand; ‘And that my name may long abide, ‘I'll give it to my land.’ VII Vain are his thoughts his hopes are lost, How soon his memory dies! His name is written in the dust Where his own carcase lies. VIII This is the folly of their way; And yet their sons, as vain, Approve the words their fathers say, And act their works again. IX Men void of wisdom and of grace, If honour raise them high, Live like the beast a thoughtless race, And like the beast they die. X Laid in the grave like silly sheep, Death feeds upon them there, Till the last trumpet break their sleep In terror and despair. PSALM 49. v. 14, 15. Second Part. (C. M.) Death and the Resurrection. I Ye sons of pride that hate the just, And trample on the poor, When death has brought you down to dust, Your pomp shall rise no more. II The last great day shall change the scene; When will that hour appear? When shall the just revive, and reign O'er all that scorn'd them here? III God will my naked soul receive, When sep'rate from the flesh; And break the prison of the grave To raise my bones afresh. IV Heaven is my everlasting home, Th'inheritance is sure; Let men of pride their rage resume, But I'll repine no more. PSALM 49. (L. M.) The rich Sinner's Death, and the Saint's Resurrection. I Why do the proud insult the poor, And boast the large estates they have? How vain are riches to secure Their haughty owners from the grave! II They can't redeem one hour from death, With all the wealth in which they trust; Nor give a dying brother breath, When God commands him down to dust. III There the dark earth and dismal shade Shall clasp their naked bodies round; That flesh, so delicately fed, Lies cold, and moulders in the ground. IV Like thoughtless sheep the sinner dies, Laid in the grave for worms to eat: The saints shall in the morning rise, And find th'oppressor at their feet. V His honours perish in the dust, And pomp and beauty, birth and blood; That glorious day exalts the just To full dominion o'er the proud. VI My Saviour shall my life restore, And raise me from my dark abode; My flesh and soul shall part no more, But dwell for ever near my God. PSALM 50. v. 1–6. First Part. (C. M.) The last Judgment; or, the Saints rewarded. I The Lord, the Judge before his throne, Bids the whole earth draw nigh, The nations near the rising sun, And near the western sky. II No more shall bold blasphemers say, ‘Judgment will ne'er begin,’ No more abuse his long delay To impudence and sin. III Thron'd on a cloud our God shall come, Bright flames prepare his way, Thunder and darkness, fire and storm, Lead on the dreadful day. IV Heaven from above his call shall hear, Attending angels come, And earth and hell shall know, and fear His justice and their doom. V ‘But gather all my saints,’ he cries, ‘That made their peace with God, ‘By the Redeemer's sacrifice, ‘And seal'd it with his blood. VI ‘Their faith and works brought forth to light ‘Shall make the world confess ‘My sentence of reward is right, ‘And heaven adore my grace.’ PSALM 50. v. 10, 11, 14, 15, 23. Second Part. (C. M.) Obedience is better than Sacrifice. I Thus saith the Lord, ‘The spacious fields, ‘And flocks and herds, are mine; ‘O'er all the cattle of the hills ‘I claim a right divine. II ‘I ask no sheep for sacrifice ‘Nor bullocks burnt with fire; ‘To hope and love, to pray and praise, ‘Is all that I require. III ‘Call upon me when trouble's near, ‘My hand shall set thee free; ‘Then shall thy thankful lips declare ‘The honour due to me. IV ‘The man that offers humble praise, ‘He glorifies me best; ‘And those that tread my holy ways ‘Shall my salvation taste.’ PSALM 50. v. 1, 5, 8, 16, 21, 22. Third Part. (C. M.) The Judgment of Hypocrites. I When Christ to judgment shall descend, And saints surround their Lord, He calls the nations to attend, And hear his awful word. II ‘Not for the want of bullocks slain ‘Will I the world reprove; ‘Altars and rites and forms are vain, ‘Without the fire of love. III ‘And what have hypocrites to do ‘To bring their sacrifice? ‘They call my statutes just and true, ‘But deal in theft and lies. IV ‘Could you expect to 'scape my sight, ‘And sin without control? ‘But I shall bring your crimes to light, ‘With anguish in your soul.’ V Consider, ye that slight the Lord, Before his wrath appear; If once you fall beneath his sword, There's no deliverer there. PSALM 50. Third Part. (L. M.) Hypocrisy exposed. I The Lord, the Judge, his churches warns, Let hypocrites attend and fear, Who place their hope in rites and forms, But make not faith nor love their care. II Vile wretches dare rehearse his name With lips of falsehood and deceit; A friend or brother they defame, And sooth and flatter those they hate. III They watch to do their neighbours wrong, Yet dare to seek their Maker's face; They take his covenant on their tongue, But break his laws, abuse his grace. IV To heaven they lift their hands unclean, Defil'd with lust, defil'd with blood; By night they practise every sin, By day their mouths draw near to God. V And while his judgments long delay, They grow secure and sin the more; They think he sleeps as well as they, And put far off the dreadful hour. VI O dreadful hour! when God draws near, And sets their crimes before their eyes! His wrath their guilty souls shall tear, And no deliverer dare to rise. This psalm having a plain reference to the Last Judgment, I have in the first part, omitted every thing that might obscure the sense of it. The latter part of this psalm being designed to expose and terrify all formal worshippers and hypocrites, I have formed two or three hymns on that subject, with some transposition and paraphrase of the verses; but I have kept the same introduction still, by repeating the first verse of the psalm. PSALM 50. To a new Tune. The last Judgment. I The Lord, the Sovereign sends his summons forth, Calls the south nations, and awakes the north; From east to west the sounding orders spread Thro' distant worlds and regions of the dead: No more shall atheists mock his long delay; His vengeance sleeps no more: behold the day! II Behold the Judge descends; his guards are nigh; Tempest and fire attend him down the sky: Heaven, earth and hell draw near: let all things come To hear his justice and the sinners doom: ‘But gather first my saints (the Judge commands) ‘Bring them, ye angels, from their distant lands. III ‘Behold! my covenant stands for ever good, All the saints have made a covenant with God by sacrifice, (as in the text) and, as it were, set their names to God's Covenant of Grace, ratified by the sacrifice of Christ, of eternal virtue; though the Jews did it in the ancient forms of worship, and the gentiles in the new. ‘Seal'd by th'eternal sacrifice in blood, ‘And sign'd with all their names; the Greek, the Jew, ‘That paid the ancient worship or the new, ‘There's no distinction here: come spread their thrones, ‘And near me seat my favourites and my sons. IV ‘I their almighty Saviour and their God ‘I am their judge: ye heavens, proclaim abroad ‘My just eternal sentence, and declare ‘Those awful truths that sinners dread to hear: ‘Sinners in Zion, tremble and retire; ‘I doom the painted hypocrite to fire. V ‘Not for the want of goats or bullocks slain ‘Do I condemn thee; bulls and goats are vain, ‘Without the flames of love: in vain the store ‘Of brutal offerings that were mine before; ‘Mine are the tamer beasts and savage breed, ‘Flocks, herds, and fields, and forests where they feed. VI ‘If I were hungry would I ask thee food? As the jewish formal worshippers contented themselves with burnt-offerings, &amp;c. and trusted in them: So hypocrites in christianity build their hopes upon outward forms, gay ceremonies, rigid austerities, fanciful vows, &amp;c. ‘When did I thirst, or drink thy bullocks blood? ‘Can I be flatter'd with thy cringing bows, ‘Thy solemn chatterings and fantastic vows? ‘Are my eyes charm'd thy vestments to behold, ‘Glaring in gems and gay in woven gold? VII ‘Unthinking wretch! how couldst thou hope to please As the jewish formal worshippers contented themselves with burnt-offerings, &amp;c. and trusted in them: So hypocrites in christianity build their hopes upon outward forms, gay ceremonies, rigid austerities, fanciful vows, &amp;c. ‘A God, a Spirit, with such toys as these? ‘While with my grace and statutes on thy tongue, ‘Thou lov'st deceit, and dost thy brother wrong; ‘In vain to pious forms thy zeal pretends, ‘Thieves and adulterers are thy chosen friends. VIII ‘Silent I waited with long-suffering love, ‘But didst thou hope that I should ne'er reprove? ‘And cherish such an impious thought within, ‘That God the righteous would indulge thy sin? ‘Behold my terrors now: my thunders roll, ‘And thy own crimes affright thy guilty soul.’ IX Sinners, awake betimes; ye fools, be wise; Awake before this dreadful morning rise; Change your vain thoughts, your crooked works amend, Fly to the Saviour, make the Judge your friend; Lest like a lion his last vengeance tear Your trembling souls, and no deliverer near. In this metre, as in some of the former, I have taken evident occasion from this psalm to represent the Last Judgment; and have therefore left out those verses which seem to interrupt that sense. PSALM 50. To the old proper Tune. The last Judgment. I The God of glory sends his summons forth, Calls the south nations and awakes the north; From east to west the sovereign orders spread Thro' distant worlds and regions of the dead: The trumpet sounds; hell trembles; heaven rejoices; Lift up your heads, ye saints, with cheerful voices. II No more shall atheists mock his long delay; His vengeance sleeps no more; behold the day; Behold the Judge descends; his guards are nigh; Tempests and fire attend him down the sky. When God appears all nature shall adore him; While sinners tremble, saints rejoice before him: III ‘Heaven, earth, and hell draw near; let all things come ‘To hear my justice and the sinners doom; ‘But gather first my saints,’ the Judge commands, ‘Bring them, ye angels, from their distant lands:’ When Christ returns, wake every cheerful passion, And shout, ye saints, he comes for your salvation. IV ‘Behold my covenant stands for ever good, ‘Seal'd by th'eternal sacrifice in blood, ‘And sign'd with all their names; the Greek, the Jew, ‘That paid the ancient worship or the new;’ There's no distinction here: join all your voices, And raise your heads, ye saints, for heaven rejoices. V ‘Here,’ saith the Lord, ‘ye angels, spread their thrones, ‘And near me seat my favourites and my sons: ‘Come, my redeem'd, possess the joys prepar'd ‘Ere time began! 'tis your divine reward:’ When Christ returns, wake every cheerful passion; And shout, ye saints, he comes for your salvation. VI ‘I am the Saviour, I th'almighty God, ‘I am the judge: ye heavens, proclaim abroad ‘My just eternal sentence, and declare ‘Those awful truths that sinners dread to hear:’ When God appears all nature shall adore him; While sinners tremble, saints rejoice before him. VII ‘Stand forth, thou bold blasphemer and profane, ‘Now feel my wrath, nor call my threatenings vain; ‘Thou hypocrite, once drest in saint's attire, ‘I doom the painted hypocrite to fire:’ Judgment proceeds; hell trembles; heaven rejoices; Lift up your heads, ye saints, with cheerful voices. VIII ‘Not for the want of goats or bullocks slain ‘Do I condemn thee; bulls and goats are vain ‘Without the flames of love: in vain the store ‘Of brutal offerings that were mine before:’ Earth is the Lord's; all nature shall adore him; While sinners tremble, saints rejoice before him. IX ‘If I were hungry, would I ask thee food? ‘When did I thirst? or drink thy bullocks blood? ‘Mine are the tamer beasts and savage breed, ‘Flocks, herds, and fields, and forests where they feed:’ All is the Lord's; he rules the wide creation; Gives sinners vengeance, and the saints salvation. X ‘Can I be flatter'd with thy cringing bows, ‘Thy solemn chatterings and fantastic vows? ‘Are my eyes charm'd thy vestments to behold, ‘Glaring in gems, and gay in woven gold?’ God is the judge of hearts; no fair disguises Can screen the guilty when his vengeance rises. XI ‘Unthinking wretch! how couldst thou hope to please ‘A God, a spirit, with such toys as these? ‘While with my grace and statutes on thy tongue, ‘Thou lovest deceit, and dost thy brother wrong?’ Judgment proceeds; hell trembles; heaven rejoices; Lift up your heads, ye saints, with cheerful voices: XII ‘In vain to pious forms thy zeal pretends, ‘Thieves and adulterers are thy chosen friends; ‘While the false flatterer at my altar waits, ‘His harden'd soul divine instruction hates:’ God is the judge of hearts; no fair disguises Can screen the guilty when his vengeance rises. XIII ‘Silent I waited with long-suffering love; ‘But didst thou hope that I should ne'er reprove? ‘And cherish such an impious thought within, ‘That the All-Holy would indulge thy sin?’ See, God appears; all nature joins t'adore him; Judgment proceeds, and sinners fall before him. XIV ‘Behold my terrors now; my thunders roll, ‘And thy own crimes affright thy guilty soul; ‘Now like a lion shall my vengeance tear ‘Thy bleeding heart, and no deliverer near:’ Judgment concludes; hell trembles; heaven rejoices; Lift up your heads, ye saints, with cheerful voices. EPIPHONEMA. XV ‘Sinners, awake betimes; ye fools, be wise; ‘Awake before this dreadful morning rise: ‘Change your vain thoughts, your crooked works amend, ‘Fly to the Saviour, make the Judge your friend:’ Then join the saints: wake every cheerful passion; When Christ returns, he comes for your salvation. If the former heroic metre do not fit the old proper tune of the fiftieth psalm, for want of double rhymes at the end of every stanza, I have here altered the form of it much, in order to fit it exactly to the old proper tune; adding a chorus, or (as some call it) the burden of the song, betwixt every four lines. I hope it will not be displeasing to the more musical part of my readers, to be entertained with such a variety. PSALM 51. First Part. (L. M.) A Penitent pleading for Pardon. I Shew pity Lord, O Lord forgive, Let a repenting rebel live: Are not thy mercies large and free? May not a sinner trust in thee? II My crimes are great, but not surpass The power and glory of thy grace: Great God, thy nature hath no bound, So let thy pardoning love be found. III O wash my soul from every sin, And make my guilty conscience clean; Here on my heart the burden lies, And past offences pain my eyes. IV My lips with shame my sins confess Against thy law, against thy grace: Lord, should thy judgment grow severe, I am condemn'd, but thou art clear. V Should sudden vengeance seize my breath, I must pronounce thee just in death; And if my soul were sent to hell, Thy righteous law approves it well. VI Yet save a trembling sinner, Lord, Whose hope still hovering round thy word, Would light on some sweet promise there, Some sure support against despair. PSALM 51. Second Part. (L. M.) Original and actual Sin confessed. I Lord, I am vile, conceiv'd in sin; And born unholy and unclean; Sprung from the man whose guilty fall Corrupts the race, and taints us all. II Soon as we draw our infant breath, The seeds of sin grow up for death; Thy law demands a perfect heart, But we're defil'd in every part. III Great God, create my heart anew, And form my spirit pure and true: O make me wise betimes to spy My danger and my remedy. IV Behold I fall before thy face; Since the psalmist seems to refer to the branch of hyssop, sprinkling the blood of the bird, and the running water, Lev. xiv. 51. I have here enlarged upon the insufficiency of all those rites, for the cleansing of sin, which is the leprosy of the soul. My only refuge is thy grace: No outward forms can make me clean; The leprosy lies deep within. V No bleeding bird, nor bleeding beast, Since the psalmist seems to refer to the branch of hyssop, sprinkling the blood of the bird, and the running water, Lev. xiv. 51. I have here enlarged upon the insufficiency of all those rites, for the cleansing of sin, which is the leprosy of the soul. Nor hyssop branch, nor sprinkling priest, Nor running brook, nor flood, nor sea, Can wash the dismal stain away. VI Jesus, my God, thy blood alone Such a glorious occasion of introducing the blood of a Saviour could not be omitted here with justice to David, or to Christ his Son. Hath power sufficient to atone; Thy blood can make me white as snow; No jewish types could cleanse me so. VII While guilt disturbs and breaks my peace, Nor flesh nor soul hath rest or ease; Lord, let me hear thy pardoning voice, And make my broken bones rejoice. PSALM 51. Third Part. (L. M.) The Backslider restored; or, Repentance and Faith in the Blood of Christ. I O thou that hear'st when sinners cry, Tho' all my crimes before thee lie, Behold them not with angry look, But blot their memory from thy book. II Create my nature pure within, And form my soul averse to sin: Let thy good Spirit ne'er depart, Nor hide thy presence from my heart. III I cannot live without thy light, Cast out and banish'd from thy sight: Thine holy joys, my God, restore, And guard me that I fall no more. IV Tho' I have griev'd thy Spirit, Lord, His help and comfort still afford: And let a wretch come near thy throne To plead the merits of thy Son. V A broken heart, my God, my king, Is all the sacrifice I bring; The God of grace will ne'er despise A broken heart for sacrifice. VI My soul lies humbled in the dust, And owns thy dreadful sentence just; Look down, O Lord, with pitying eye, And save the soul condemn'd to die. VII Then will I teach the world thy ways; Sinners shall learn thy sovereign grace; I'll lead them to my Saviour's blood, And they shall praise a pardoning God. VIII O may thy love inspire my tongue! Salvation shall be all my song; And all my powers shall join to bless The Lord, my strength and righteousness. The 17th verse, concerning the sacrifice of a broken heart, I have here transposed, to make an easier connection. PSALM 51. v. 3–13. First Part. (C. M.) Original and actual Sin confessed and pardoned. I Lord, I would spread my sore distress And guilt before thine eyes; Against thy laws, against thy grace, How high my crimes arise! II Shouldst thou condemn my soul to hell, And crush my flesh to dust, Heaven would approve thy vengeance well, And earth must own it just. III I from the stock of Adam came, Unholy and unclean: All my original is shame, And all my nature sin. Or it may be read, My nature prone to sin. IV Born in a world of guilt, I drew Contagion with my breath; And, as my days advanc'd, I grew A juster prey for death. V Cleanse me, O Lord, and cheer my soul With thy forgiving love; O, make my broken spirit whole, And bid my pains remove. VI Let not thy Spirit quite depart, Nor drive me from thy face; Create anew my vicious heart, And fill it with thy grace. VII Then will I make thy mercy known Before the sons of men; Backsliders shall address thy throne, And turn to God again. PSALM 51. v. 14–17. Second Part. (C. M.) Repentance and Faith in the Blood of Christ. I O God of mercy! hear my call, My loads of guilt remove, Break down this separating wall That bars me from thy love. II Give me the presence of thy grace, Then my rejoicing tongue Shall speak aloud thy righteousness, And make thy praise my song. III No blood of goats, nor heifer slain, For sin could e'er atone; The death of Christ shall still remain Sufficient and alone. IV A soul opprest with sin's desert, My God will ne'er despise; A humble groan, a broken heart, Is our best sacrifice. PSALM 53. v. 4–6. (C. M.) Victory and Deliverance from Persecution. I Are all the foes of Sion fools, Who thus devour her saints? Do they not know her Saviour rules, And pities her complaints? II They shall be seiz'd with sad surprise; For God's avenging arm Scatters the bones of them that rise To do his children harm. III In vain the sons of Satan boast Of armies in array; When God has first despis'd their host, They fall an easy prey. IV O for a word from Sion's King Her captives to restore! Jacob with all his tribes shall sing, And Judah weep no more. The first part of this psalm is the same with the fourteenth. PSALM 55. v. 1–8, 16–18, 22. (C. M.) Support for the afflicted and tempted Soul. I O God, my refuge, hear my cries, Behold my flowing tears, For earth and hell my hurt devise, And triumph in my fears. II Their rage is levell'd at my life, My soul with guilt they load, And fill my thoughts with inward strife To shake my hope in God. III With inward pain my heart-strings sound, I groan with every breath; Horror and fear beset me round Amongst the shades of death. IV O were I like a feather'd dove, And innocence had wings; I'd fly, and make a long remove From all these restless things. V Let me to some wild desert go, And find a peaceful home, Where storms of malice never blow, Temptations never come. VI Vain hopes, and vain inventions all To 'scape the rage of hell! The mighty God on whom I call Can save me here as well. VII By morning light I'll seek his face, At noon repeat my cry, The night shall hear me ask his grace, Nor will he long deny. VIII God shall preserve my soul from fear, Or shield me when afraid; Ten thousand angels must appear If he command their aid. IX I cast my burdens on the Lord, The Lord sustains them all; My courage rests upon his word That saints shall never fall. X My highest hopes shall not be vain, My lips shall spread his praise; While cruel and deceitful men Scarce live out half their days. I have left out some whole psalms, and several parts of others that tend to fill the mind with overwhelming sorrows, or sharp resentment; neither of which are so well suited to the spirit of the gospel, and therefore the particular complaints of David against Achitopel here are entirely omitted. PSALM 55. v. 15–17, 19, 22. (S. M.) Dangerous Prosperity; or, Daily Devotions encouraged. I Let sinners take their course, And choose the road to death; But in the worship of my God I'll spend my daily breath. II My thoughts address his throne, When morning brings the light; I seek his blessing every noon, And pay my vows at night. III Thou wilt regard my cries, O my eternal God, While sinners perish in surprise Beneath thine angry rod. IV Because they dwell at ease, And no sad changes feel, They neither fear nor trust thy name, Nor learn to do thy will. V But I with all my cares Will lean upon the Lord, I'll cast my burdens on his arm, And rest upon his word. VI His arm shall well sustain The children of his love; The ground on which their safety stands No earthly power can move. PSALM 56. (C. M.) Deliverance from Oppression and Falsehood; or, God's Care of his People, in answer to Faith and Prayer. I O thou, whose justice reigns on high, And makes th'oppressor cease, Behold how envious sinners try To vex and break my peace! II The sons of violence and lies Join to devour me, Lord; But as my hourly dangers rise My refuge is thy word. III In God most holy, just, and true, I have repos'd my trust; Nor will I fear what flesh can do, The offspring of the dust. IV They wrest my words to mischief still, Charge me with unknown faults; Mischief doth all their counsels fill, And malice all their thoughts. V Shall they escape without thy frown? Must their devices stand? O cast the haughty sinner down, And let him know thy hand! VI God counts the sorrows of his saints, Their groans affect his ears; Thou hast a book for my complaints, A bottle for my tears. VII When to thy throne I raise my cry, The wicked fear and flee; So swift is prayer to reach the sky, So near is God to me. VIII In thee most holy, just and true, I have repos'd my trust; Nor will I fear what man can do, The offspring of the dust. IX Thy solemn vows are on me, Lord, Thou shalt receive my praise; I'll sing, ‘How faithful is thy word! ‘How righteous all thy ways!’ X Thou hast secur'd my soul from death, O set thy prisoner free, That heart and hand, and life and breath May be employ'd for thee. PSALM 57. (L. M.) Praise for Protection, Grace, and Truth. I My God, in whom are all the springs Of boundless love, and grace unknown, Hide me beneath thy spreading wings Till the dark cloud is overblown. II Up to the heavens I send my cry, The Lord will my desires perform; He sends his angel from the sky, And saves me from the threatening storm. III Be thou exalted, O my God, Above the heavens where angels dwell; Thy power on earth be known abroad, And land to land thy wonders tell. IV My heart is fix'd; my song shall raise Immortal honours to thy name; Awake, my tongue, to sound his praise, My tongue, the glory of my frame. V High o'er the earth his mercy reigns, And reaches to the utmost sky; His truth to endless years remains, When lower worlds dissolve and die. VI Be thou exalted, O my God, Above the heavens where angels dwell; Thy power on earth be known abroad, And land to land thy wonders tell. PSALM 58. As the 113th Psalm. Warning to Magistrates. I Judges, who rule the world by laws, Will ye despise the righteous cause, When th'injur'd poor before you stand? Dare you condemn the righteous poor, And let rich sinners 'scape secure, While gold and greatness bribe your hands? II Have ye forgot, or never knew, That God will judge the judges too? High in the heavens his justice reigns; Yet you invade the rights of God, And send your bold decrees abroad, To bind the conscience in your chains. III A poison'd arrow is your tongue, The arrow sharp, the poison strong, And death attends where'er it wounds: You hear no counsels, cries or tears; So the deaf adder stops her ears Against the power of charming sounds. IV Break out their teeth, eternal God, Those teeth of lions dy'd in blood; And crush the serpents in the dust: As empty chaff, when whirlwinds rise, Before the sweeping tempest flies, So let their hopes and names be lost. V Th'Almighty thunders from the sky, Their grandeur melts, their titles die, As hills of snow dissolve and run, Or snails that perish in their slime, Or births, that come before their time, Vain births, that never see the sun. VI Thus shall the vengeance of the Lord Safety and joy to saints afford; And all that hear shall join and say, ‘Sure there's a God that rules on high, ‘A God that hears his children cry, ‘And will their sufferings well repay.’ PSALM 60. v. 1–5, 10–12. (C. M.) On a Day of Humiliation for Disappointments in War. I Lord, hast thou cast the nation off? Must we for ever mourn? Wilt thou indulge immortal wrath? Shall mercy ne'er return? II The terror of one frown of thine Melts all our strength away; Like men that totter drunk with wine, We tremble in dismay. III Great Britain shakes beneath thy stroke, And dreads thy threatening hand; O heal the island thou hast broke, Confirm the wavering land. IV Lift up a banner in the field, For those that fear thy name; Save thy beloved with thy shield, And put our foes to shame. V Go with our armies to the fight Like a confederate God; In vain confederate powers unite Against thy lifted rod. VI Our troops shall gain a wide renown By thine assisting hand; 'Tis God that treads the mighty down, And makes the feeble stand. PSALM 61. v. 1–6. (S. M.) Safety in God. I When overwhelm'd with grief My heart within me dies, Helpless and far from all relief To heaven I lift mine eyes. II O lead me to the rock That's high above my head, And make the covert of thy wings My shelter and my shade. III Within thy presence, Lord, For ever I'll abide; Thou art the tower of my defence, The refuge where I hide. IV Thou givest me the lot Of those that fear thy name; If endless life be their reward, I shall possess the same. PSALM 62. v. 5–12. (L. M.) No Trust in the Creatures; or, Faith in divine Grace and Power. I My spirit looks to God alone; My rock and refuge is his throne; In all my fears, in all my straits, My soul on his salvation waits. II Trust him, ye saints, in all your ways, Pour out your hearts before his face; When helpers fail, and foes invade, God is our all-sufficient aid. III False are the men of high degree, The baser sort are vanity; Laid in the balance both appear Light as a puff of empty air. IV Make not increasing gold your trust, Nor set your heart on glittering dust; Why will you grasp the fleeting smoke, And not believe what God hath spoke? V Once has his awful voice declar'd, Once and again my ears have heard, ‘All power is his eternal due; ‘He must be feared and trusted too.’ VI For sovereign power reigns not alone, Grace is a partner of the throne: Thy grace and justice, mighty Lord, Shall well divide our last reward. PSALM 63. v. 1, 2, 5, 3, 4. First Part. (C. M.) The Morning of a Lord's Day. I Early, my God, without delay I haste to seek thy face; My thirsty spirit faints away, Without thy cheering grace. II So pilgrims on the scorching sand, Beneath a burning sky, Long for a cooling stream at hand, And they must drink or die. III I've seen thy glory and thy power Thro' all thy temple shine; My God, repeat that heavenly hour, That vision so divine. IV Not all the blessings of a feast Can please my soul so well, As when thy richer grace I taste, And in thy presence dwell. V Not life itself, with all her joys, Can my best passions move, Or raise so high my cheerful voice As thy forgiving love. VI Thus till my last expiring day I'll bless my God and king; Thus will I lift my hands to pray, And tune my lips to sing. PSALM 63. v. 6–10. Second Part. (C. M.) Midnight Thoughts recollected. I 'Twas in the watches of the night I thought upon thy power, I kept thy lovely face in sight Amidst the darkest hour. II My flesh lay resting on my bed, My soul arose on high; ‘My God, my life, my hope,’ I said, ‘Bring thy salvation nigh.’ III My spirit labours up thine hill, And climbs the heavenly road; But thy right hand upholds me still, While I pursue my God. IV Thy mercy stretches o'er my head The shadow of thy wings; My heart rejoices in thine aid, My tongue awakes and sings. V But the destroyers of my peace Shall fret and rage in vain; The tempter shall for ever cease, And all my sins be slain. VI Thy sword shall give my foes to death, And send them down to dwell In the dark caverns of the earth, Or to the deeps of hell. PSALM 63. (L. M.) Longing after God; or, the Love of God better than Life. I Great God, indulge my humble claim, Thou art my hope, my joy, my rest; The glories that compose thy name Stand all engag'd to make me blest. II Thou great and good, thou just and wise, Thou art my Father and my God; And I am thine by sacred ties; Thy son, thy servant bought with blood. III With heart, and eyes, and lifted hands, For thee I long, to thee I look, As travellers in thirsty lands Pant for the cooling water brook. IV With early feet I love t'appear Among thy saints and seek thy face; Oft have I seen thy glory there, And felt the power of sovereign grace. V Not fruits nor wines that tempt our taste, Not all the joys our senses know, Could make me so divinely blest, Or raise my cheerful passions so. VI My life itself without thy love No taste of pleasure could afford; 'Twould but a tiresome burden prove, If I were banish'd from the Lord. VII Amidst the wakeful hours of night, When busy cares afflict my head, One thought of thee gives new delight, And adds refreshment to my bed. VIII I'll lift my hands, I'll raise my voice, While I have breath to pray or praise; This work shall make my heart rejoice, And spend the remnant of my days. PSALM 63. (S. M.) Seeking God. I My God, permit my tongue This joy, to call thee mine, And let my early cries prevail To taste thy love divine. II My thirsty fainting soul Thy mercy doth implore; Not travellers in desert lands Can pant for water more. III Within thy churches, Lord, I long to find my place, Thy power and glory to behold, And feel thy quickening grace. IV For life without thy love No relish can afford; No joy can be compar'd to this, To serve and please the Lord. V To thee I'll lift mine hands, And praise thee while I live; Not the rich dainties of a feast Such food or pleasure give. VI In wakeful hours at night I call my God to mind; I think how wise thy counsels are, And all thy dealings kind. VII Since thou hast been my help, To thee my spirit flies, And on thy watchful providence My cheerful hope relies. VIII The shadow of thy wings My soul in safety keeps; I follow where my father leads, And he supports my steps. After I had finished the Common Metre of this psalm, I observed several pious turns of thought in Dr. Patrick's Version, which I have copied in this Metre, though with some difficulty, because of the shorter lines. PSALM 65. v. 1–5. First Part. (L. M.) Public Prayer and Praise. I The praise of Sion waits for thee, My God; and praise becomes thy house; There shall thy saints thy glory see, And there perform their public vows. II O thou, whose mercy bends the skies To save when humble sinners pray, All lands to thee shall lift their eyes, And islands of the northern sea. III Against my will my sins prevail, But grace shall purge away their stain; The blood of Christ will never fail To wash my garments white again. IV Blest is the man whom thou shalt choose, And give him kind access to thee, Give him a place within thy house, To taste thy love divinely free. V Let Babel fear when Sion prays; Babel, prepare for long distress When Sion's God himself arrays In terror and in righteousness. VI With dreadful glory God fulfils What his afflicted saints request; And with almighty wrath reveals His love to give his churches rest. VII Then shall the flocking nations run To Sion's hill, and own their Lord: The rising and the setting sun Shall see the Saviour's name ador'd. PSALM 65. v. 5–13. Second Part. (L. M.) Divine Providence in Air, Earth, and Sea; or, the God of Nature and Grace. I The God of our salvation hears The groans of Sion mix'd with tears; Yet when he comes with kind designs, Thro' all the way his terror shines. II On him the race of man depends, Far as the earth's remotest ends, Where the Creator's name is known By nature's feeble light alone. III Sailors that travel o'er the flood, Address their frighted souls to God; When tempests rage and billows roar At dreadful distance from the shore. IV He bids the noisy tempests cease; He calms the raging crowd to peace, When a tumultuous nation raves Wild as the winds, and loud as waves. V Whole kingdoms shaken by the storm He settles in a peaceful form; Mountains establish'd by his hand Firm on their old foundations stand. VI Behold his ensigns sweep the sky, New comets blaze and lightnings fly, The heathen lands, with swift surprise, From the bright horrors turn their eyes. VII At his command the morning ray Smiles in the east, and leads the day; He guides the sun's declining wheels Over the tops of western hills. VIII Seasons and times obey his voice; The evening and the morn rejoice To see the earth made soft with showers, Laden with fruit and drest in flowers. IX 'Tis from his watery stores on high, He gives the thirsty ground supply; He walks upon the clouds, and thence Doth his enriching drops dispense. X The desert grows a fruitful field, Abundant food the vallies yield; The vallies shout with cheerful voice, The neighb'ring hills repeat their joys. XI The pastures smile in green array, There lambs and larger cattle play; The larger cattle and the lamb, Each in his language speaks thy name. XII Thy works pronounce thy power divine; O'er every field thy glories shine, Thro' every month thy gifts appear; Great God! thy goodness crowns the year. PSALM 65. First Part. (C. M.) A Prayer-hearing God, and the Gentiles called. I Praise waits in Sion, Lord, for thee; There shall our vows be paid: Thou hast an ear when sinners pray, All flesh shall seek thine aid. II Lord, our iniquities prevail, But pardoning grace is thine, And thou wilt grant us power and skill To conquer every sin. III Blest are the men whom thou wilt choose To bring them near thy face, Give them a dwelling in thine house To feast upon thy grace. IV In answering what thy church requests, Thy truth and terror shine, And works of dreadful righteousness Fulfil thy kind design. V Thus shall the wondering nations see The Lord is good and just And distant islands fly to thee, And make thy name their trust. VI They dread thy glittering tokens, Lord, When signs in heaven appear; But they shall learn thy holy word, And love as well as fear. PSALM 65. Second Part. (C. M.) The Providence of God in Air, Earth, and Sea; or, the Blessings of Rain. I 'Tis by thy strength the mountains stand, God of eternal power; The sea grows calm at thy command, And tempests cease to roar. II Thy morning light and evening shade Successive comforts bring; Thy plenteous fruits make harvest glad, Thy flowers adorn the spring. III Seasons and times, and moons and hours, Heaven, earth, and air are thine; When clouds distil in fruitful showers, The author is divine. IV Those wandering cisterns in the sky, Borne by the winds around, With watery treasures well supply The furrows of the ground. V The thirsty ridges drink their fill, And ranks of corn appear; Thy ways abound with blessings still, Thy goodness crowns the year. PSALM 65. Third Part (C. M.) The Blessings of the Spring; or, God gives Rain. A Psalm for the Husbandman. I Good is the Lord, the heavenly king, Who makes the earth his care, Visits the pastures every spring, And bids the grass appear. II The clouds, like rivers rais'd on high, Pour out, at thy command, Their watery blessings from the sky, To cheer the thirsty land. III The soften'd ridges of the field Permit the corn to spring; The vallies rich provision yield, And the poor labourers sing. IV The little hills on every side Rejoice at falling showers; The meadows, drest in all their pride, Perfume the air with flowers. V The barren clods, refresh'd with rain, Promise a joyful crop; The parching grounds look green again, And raise the reaper's hope. VI The various months thy goodness crowns; How bounteous are thy ways! The bleating flocks spread o'er the downs, And shepherds shout thy praise. PSALM 66. First Part. (C. M.) Governing Power and Goodness; or, our Graces tried by Afflictions. I Sing, all ye nations, to the Lord, Sing with a joyful noise; With melody of sound record His honours, and your joys. II Say to the power that shakes the sky, ‘How terrible art thou! ‘Sinners before thy presence fly, ‘Or at thy feet they bow.’ III Come, see the wonders of our God, How glorious are his ways! In Moses' hand he puts his rod, And cleaves the frighted seas. IV He made the ebbing channel dry, While Israel pass'd the flood; There did the church begin their joy, And triumph in their God. V He rules by his resistless might: Will rebel-mortals dare Provoke th'Eternal to the fight, And tempt that dreadful war? VI O bless our God, and never cease; Ye saints, fulfil his praise; He keeps our life, maintains our peace, And guides our doubtful ways. VII Lord, thou has prov'd our suffering souls, To make our graces shine; So silver bears the burning coals The metal to refine. VIII Thro' watery deeps and fiery ways We march at thy command, Led to possess the promis'd place By thine unerring hand. PSALM 66. v. 13–20. Second Part. (C. M.) Praise to God for hearing Prayer. I Now shall my solemn vows be paid To that almighty power, That heard the long requests I made In my distressful hour. II My lips and cheerful heart prepare To make his mercies known; Come, ye that fear my God, and hear, The wonders he has done. III When on my head huge sorrows fell, I sought his heavenly aid; He sav'd my sinking soul from hell And death's eternal shade. IV If sin lay cover'd in my heart, While prayer employ'd my tongue, The Lord had shewn me no regard, Nor I his praises sung. V But God, (his name be ever blest) Hath set my spirit free, Nor turn'd from him my poor request, Nor turn'd his heart from me. PSALM 67. (C. M.) The Nation's Prosperity and the Church's Increase. I Shine, mighty God, on Britain shine With beams of heavenly grace; Reveal thy power through all our coasts, And shew thy smiling face. II Amidst our isle, exalted high, Do thou our glory stand, And like a wall of guardian fire Surround the favourite land. III When shall thy name, from shore to shore, Sound all the earth abroad, And distant nations know and love Their Saviour and their God? IV Sing to the Lord, ye distant lands, Sing loud with solemn voice; While British tongues exalt his praise, And British hearts rejoice. V He the great Lord, the sovereign judge, That sits enthron'd above, Wisely commands the worlds he made In justice and in love. VI Earth shall obey her Maker's will, And yield a full increase; Our God will crown his chosen isle With fruitfulness and peace. VII God the Redeemer scatters round His choicest favours here, While the creation's utmost bound Shall see, adore, and fear. Having translated the scene of this psalm to Great Britain, I have borrowed a devout and poetical wish for the happiness of my native land, from Zech. ii. 5. and offered it up in the second stanza. I will be a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her. PSALM 68. v. 1–6, 32–35. First Part. (L. M.) The Vengeance and Compassion of God. I Let God arise in all his might, And put the troops of hell to flight, As smoke that sought to cloud the skies Before the rising tempest flies. II He comes array'd in burning flames; Justice and vengeance are his names: Behold his fainting foes expire Like melting wax before the fire. III He rides and thunders thro' the sky; His name Jehovah sounds on high: Sing to his name, ye sons of grace; Ye saints, rejoice before his face. IV The widow and the fatherless Fly to his aid in sharp distress: In him the poor and helpless find A judge that's just, a father kind. V He breaks the captive's heavy chain, And prisoners see the light again; But rebels, that dispute his will, Shall dwell in chains and darkness still. VI Kingdoms and thrones to God belong; Crown him, ye nations, in your song: His wondrous names and powers rehearse; His honours shall enrich your verse. VII He shakes the heavens with loud alarms; How terrible is God in arms! In Israel are his mercies known, Israel is his peculiar throne. VIII Proclaim him king, pronounce him blest; He's your defence, your joy, your rest: When terrors rise and nations faint, God is the strength of every saint. PSALM 68. v. 17, 18. Second Part. (L. M.) Christ's Ascension, and the Gift of the Spirit. I Lord, when thou didst ascend on high, Ten thousand angels fill'd the sky; Those heavenly guards around thee wait, Like chariots that attend thy state. II Not Sinai's mountain could appear More glorious when the Lord was there; While he pronounc'd his dreadful law, And struck the chosen tribes with awe. III How bright the triumph none can tell, When the rebellious powers of hell That thousand souls had captive made, Were all in chains like captives led. IV Rais'd by his Father to the throne, He sent the promis'd Spirit down, With gifts and grace for rebel men, That God might dwell on earth again. The 17th and 18th verses of this psalm are applied to the ascension of Christ, Eph. iv. 8. and the promised spirit was then given to men, Acts ii. 33. PSALM 68. v. 19, 9, 20–22. Third Part. (L. M.) Praise for temporal Blessings; or, common and special Mercies. I We bless the Lord, the just, the good, Who fills our hearts with joy and food; Who pours his blessings from the skies, And loads our days with rich supplies. II He sends the sun his circuit round To cheer the fruits, to warm the ground; He bids the clouds, with plenteous rain, Refresh the thirsty earth again. III 'Tis to his care we owe our breath, And all our near escapes from death: Safety and health to God belong; He heals the weak, and guards the strong. IV He makes the saint and sinner prove The common blessings of his love; But the wide difference that remains Is endless joy, or endless pains. V The Lord, that bruis'd the serpent's head, On all the serpent's seed shall tread; The stubborn sinner's hope confound, And smite him with a lasting wound. VI But his right hand his saints shall raise From the deep earth, or deeper seas; And bring them to his courts above, There shall they taste his special love. The verses marked in the title afforded me several hints to form a divine song on the subject there expressed. PSALM 69. v. 1–14. First Part. (C. M.) The Sufferings of Christ for our Salvation. I ‘Save me, O God, the swelling floods ‘Break in upon my soul: ‘I sink, and sorrows o'er my head ‘Like mighty waters roll. II ‘I cry till all my voice be gone, ‘In tears I waste the day: ‘My God, behold my longing eyes, ‘And shorten thy delay. III ‘They hate my soul without a cause, ‘And still their number grows ‘More than the hairs around my head, ‘And mighty are my foes. IV ‘'Twas then I paid that dreadful debt ‘That men could never pay, ‘And gave those honours to thy law ‘Which sinners took away.’ V Thus, in the great Messiah's name, The royal prophet mourns; Thus he awakes our hearts to grief, And gives us joy by turns. VI ‘Now shall the saints rejoice and find ‘Salvation in my name, ‘For I have borne their heavy load ‘Of sorrow, pain, and shame. VII ‘Grief, like a garment, cloth'd me round, I borrow the robe of righteousness from Isaiah lxi. 10. to answer the garment of sackcloth, ver. 11. ‘And sackcloth was my dress, ‘While I procur'd for naked souls, ‘A robe of righteousness. VIII ‘Amongst my brethren and the Jews ‘I like a stranger stood, ‘And bore their vile reproach, to bring ‘The gentiles near to God. IX ‘I came in sinful mortal's stead ‘To do my Father's will; ‘Yet when I cleans'd my Father's house, ‘They scandaliz'd my zeal. X ‘My fasting and my holy groans ‘Were made the drunkard's song; ‘But God, from his celestial throne, ‘Heard my complaining tongue. XI ‘He sav'd me from the dreadful deep, ‘Nor let my soul be drown'd; ‘He rais'd and fix'd my sinking feet ‘On well establish'd ground. XII ‘'Twas in a most accepted hour ‘My prayer arose on high, ‘And for my sake my God shall hear ‘The dying sinner's cry.’ PSALM 69. v. 14–21, 26 29, 32. Second Part. (C. M.) The Passion and Exaltation of Christ. I Now let our lips with holy fear And mournful pleasure sing The sufferings of our great High-Priest, The sorrows of our King. II He sinks in floods of deep distress; How high the waters rise! While to his heavenly Father's ear He sends perpetual cries. III ‘Hear me, O Lord, and save thy Son, ‘Nor hide thy shining face; ‘Why should thy favourite look like one ‘Forsaken of thy grace? IV ‘With rage they persecute the man ‘That groans beneath thy wound, ‘While for a sacrifice I pour ‘My life upon the ground. V ‘They tread my honour to the dust, ‘And laugh when I complain; ‘Their sharp insulting slanders add ‘Fresh anguish to my pain. VI ‘All my reproach is known to thee, ‘The scandal and the shame; ‘Reproach has broke my bleeding heart, ‘And lies defil'd my name. VII ‘I look'd for pity, but in vain; ‘My kindred are my grief; ‘I ask my friends for comfort round, ‘But meet with no relief. VIII ‘With vinegar they mock my thirst, ‘They give me gall for food: ‘And sporting with my dying groans, ‘They triumph in my blood. IX ‘Shine into my distressed soul, ‘Let thy compassion save; ‘And though my flesh sink down to death, ‘Redeem it from the grave. X ‘I shall arise to praise thy name, ‘Shall reign in worlds unknown; ‘And thy salvation, O my God, ‘Shall seat me on thy throne. PSALM 69. Third Part. (C. M.) Christ's Obedience and Death; or, God glorified, and Sinners saved. I Father, I sing thy wondrous grace, I bless my Saviour's name, He bought salvation for the poor, And bore the sinner's shame. II His deep distress has rais'd us high, His duty and his zeal Fulfill'd the law which mortals broke, And finish'd all thy will. III His dying groans, his living songs Shall better please my God, Than harp or trumpet's solemn sound, Than goats or bullocks blood. IV This shall his humble followers see, And set their hearts at rest; They by his death draw near to thee, And live for ever blest. V Let heaven, and all that dwell on high To God their voices raise, While lands and seas assist the sky, And join t'advance the praise. VI Zion is thine, most holy God; Thy Son shall bless her gates; And glory purchas'd by his blood For thy own Israel waits. PSALM 69. First Part. (L. M.) Christ's Passion, and Sinner's Salvation. I Deep in our hearts let us record The deeper sorrows of our Lord; Behold the rising billows roll To overwhelm his holy soul. II In long complaints he spends his breath, While hosts of hell, and powers of death And all the sons of malice join To execute their curst design. III Yet, gracious God, thy power and love Has made the curse a blessing prove; Those dreadful sufferings of thy Son Aton'd for sins which we had done. IV The pangs of our expiring Lord The honours of thy law restor'd; His sorrows made thy justice known, And paid for follies not his own. V O for his sake our guilt forgive, And let the mourning sinner live: The Lord will hear us in his name, Nor shall our hope be turn'd to shame. PSALM 69. v. 7, &amp;c. Second Part. (L. M.) Christ's Sufferings and Zeal. I Twas for thy sake, eternal God, Thy Son sustain'd that heavy load Of base reproach and sore disgrace, And shame defil'd his sacred face. II The Jews, his brethren and his kin, Abus'd the man that check'd their sin: While he fulfill'd thy holy laws, They hate him, but without a cause. III ‘My Father's house,’ said he, ‘was made ‘A place for worship, not for trade;’ Then scattering all their gold and brass, He scourg'd the merchants from the place. IV Zeal for the temple of his God Consum'd his life, expos'd his blood: Reproaches at thy glory thrown He felt, and mourn'd them as his own. V His friends forsook, his followers fled, The false judge is the high-priest, not Pilate. While foes and arms surround his head; They curse him with a slanderous tongue, And the false judge maintains the wrong. VI His life they load with hateful lies, And charge his lips with blasphemies; They nail him to the shameful tree; There hung the man that dy'd for me. VII Wretches with hearts as hard as stones, Insult his piety and groans: Gall was the food they gave him there, And mock'd his thirst with vinegar. VIII But God beheld; and from his throne Marks out the men that hate his Son; The hand that rais'd him from the dead Shall pour the vengeance on their head. In both the metres of this psalm, I have applied it to the sufferings of Christ, as the New Testament gives sufficient reason, by several citations of this psalm: From which places I have borrowed the particulars of his sufferings for our sins, his scourging the buyers and sellers out of the temple, his crucifixion, &amp;c. But I have omitted the dreadful imprecations on his enemies, except what is inserted in this last stanza, in the way of a prediction or threatening. PSALM 71. v. 5–9. First Part. (C. M.) The aged Saint's Reflection and Hope. I My God, my everlasting hope, I live upon thy truth; Thine hands have held my childhood up, And strengthen'd all my youth. II My flesh was fashion'd by thy power, With all these limbs of mine; And from my mother's painful hour I've been entirely thine. III Still has my life new wonders seen Repeated every year; Behold my days that yet remain, I trust them to thy care. IV Cast me not off when strength declines, When hoary hairs arise; And round me let thy glory shine Whene'er thy servant dies. V Then in the history of my age, When men review my days, They'll read thy love in every page, In every line thy praise. PSALM 71. v. 15, 14, 16, 23, 22, 24. Second Part. (C. M.) Christ our Strength and Righteousness. I My Saviour, my almighty friend, When I begin thy praise, Where will the growing numbers end, The numbers of thy grace? II Thou art my everlasting trust, Thy goodness I adore; And since I knew thy graces first I speak thy glories more. III My feet shall travel all the length Of the celestial road, And march with courage in thy strength To see my Father God. IV When I am fill'd with sore distress For some surprising sin, I'll plead thy perfect righteousness, And mention none but thine. V How will my lips rejoice to tell The victories of my King! My soul redeem'd from sin and hell Shall thy salvation sing. VI My tongue shall all the day proclaim My Saviour and my God; His death has brought my foes to shame, And drown'd them in his blood. VII Awake, awake, my tuneful powers; With this delightful song I'll entertain the darkest hours, Nor think the season long. If these verses of the psalmist do not directly intend, that in God our Saviour is our righteousness and strength, as Isaiah xlv. 21–25. yet there is a fair occasion given in the words for this evangelical turn of thought. PSALM 71. v. 17–21. Third Part. (C. M.) The aged Christian's Prayer and Song; or, old Age, Death, and the Resurrection. I God of my childhood and my youth, The guide of all my days, I have declar'd thy heavenly truth, And told thy wondrous ways. II Wilt thou forsake my hoary hairs, And leave my fainting heart? Who shall sustain my sinking years If God my strength depart! III Let me thy power and truth proclaim To the surviving age, And leave a savour of thy name When I shall quit the stage. IV The land of silence and of death Attends my next remove; O may these poor remains of breath Teach the wide world thy love! V Thy righteousness is deep and high, Unsearchable thy deeds; Thy glory spreads beyond the sky, And all my praise exceeds. VI Oft have I heard thy threatenings roar, And oft endur'd the grief; But when thy hand has prest me sore, Thy grace was my relief. VII By long experience have I known Thy sovereign power to save; At thy command I venture down Securely to the grave. VIII When I lie buried deep in dust, My flesh shall be thy care; These withering limbs with thee I trust To raise them strong and fair. So fair a profession and faith of the resurrection in verse 20, I could not omit without injury to the psalmist, and to my own design. PSALM 72. First Part. (L. M.) The Kingdom of Christ. I Great God whose universal sway The known and unknown worlds obey, Now give the kingdom to thy Son, Extend his power, exalt his throne. II Thy sceptre well becomes his hands, All heaven submits to his commands; His justice shall avenge the poor, And pride and rage prevail no more. III With power he vindicates the just, And treads the oppressor in the dust; His worship and his fear shall last Till hours and years and time be past. IV As rain on meadows newly mown So shall he send his influence down; His grace on fainting souls distils Like heavenly dew on thirsty hills. V The heathen lands that lie beneath The shades of overspreading death, Revive at his first dawning light, And deserts blossom at the sight. VI The saints shall flourish in his days, Drest in the robes of joy and praise; Peace like a river from his throne Shall flow to nations yet unknown. PSALM 72. Second Part. (L. M.) Christ's Kingdom among the Gentiles. I Jesus shall reign where'er the sun Does his successive journies run; His kingdom stretch from shore to shore, Till moons shall wax and wane no more. II Behold the islands with their kings, And Europe her best tribute brings; From north to south the princes meet To pay their homage at his feet. III There Persia glorious to behold, There India shines in eastern gold; And barbarous nations at his word Submit, and bow, and own their Lord. IV For him shall endless prayer be made, And praises throng to crown his head; His name like sweet perfume shall rise With every morning sacrifice. V People and realms of every tongue Dwell on his love with sweetest song; And infant voices shall proclaim Their early blessings on his name. VI Blessings abound where'er he reigns, The prisoner leaps to lose his chains, The weary find eternal rest, And all the sons of want are blest. VII Where he displays his healing power, Death and the curse are known no more; In him the tribes of Adam boast More blessings than their father lost. VIII Let every creature rise, and bring Peculiar honours to our king; Angels descend with songs again, And earth repeat the long Amen. PSALM 73. First Part. (C. M.) Afflicted Saints happy, and prosperous Sinners cursed. I Now I'm convinc'd the Lord is kind To men of heart sincere, Yet once my foolish thoughts repin'd, And border'd on despair. II I griev'd to see the wicked thrive, And spoke with angry breath, ‘How pleasant and profane they live! ‘How peaceful is their death! III ‘With well-fed flesh and haughty eyes ‘They lay their fears to sleep; ‘Against the heavens their slanders rise, ‘While saints in silence weep. IV ‘In vain I lift my hands to pray, ‘And cleanse my heart in vain, ‘For I am chasten'd all the day, ‘The night renews my pain.’ V Yet while my tongue indulg'd complaints, I felt my heart reprove; ‘Sure I shall thus offend thy saints, ‘And grieve the men I love.’ VI But still I found my doubts too hard, The conflict too severe, Till I retir'd to search thy word, And learn thy secrets there. VII There, as in some prophetic glass, I saw the sinner's feet High mounted on a slippery place Beside a fiery pit. VIII I heard the wretch profanely boast, Till at thy frown he fell; His honours in a dream were lost, And he awakes in hell. IX Lord, what an envious fool I was! How like a thoughtless beast! Thus to suspect thy promis'd grace, And think the wicked blest. X Yet I was kept from full despair, Upheld by power unknown; That blessed hand that broke the snare Shall guide me to thy throne. PSALM 73. v. 23–28. Second Part. (C. M.) God our Portion here and hereafter. I God my supporter and my hope, My help for ever near, Thine arm of mercy held me up When sinking in despair. II Thy counsels, Lord, shall guide my feet Through this dark wilderness; Thine hand conduct me near thy seat To dwell before thy face. III Were I in heaven without my God, 'Twould be no joy to me; And whilst this earth is my abode, I long for none but thee. IV What if the springs of life were broke, And flesh and heart should faint! God is my soul's eternal rock, The strength of every saint. V Behold, the sinners' that remove Far from thy presence die; Not all the idol-gods they love Can save them when they cry. VI But to draw near to thee my God, Shall be my sweet employ; My tongue shall sound thy works abroad, And tell the world my joy. PSALM 73. v. 22, 3, 6, 17–20. (L. M.) The Prosperity of Sinners cursed. I Lord, what a thoughtless wretch was I, To mourn, and murmur, and repine To see the wicked plac'd on high, In pride and robes of honour shine! II But oh their end, their dreadful end! Thy sanctuary taught me so: On slippery rocks I see them stand, And fiery billows roll below. III Now let them boast how tall they rise, I'll never envy them again; There they may stand with haughty eyes, Till they plunge deep in endless pain. IV Their fancy'd joys, how fast they flee! Just like a dream when man awakes; Their songs of softest harmony Are but a preface to their plagues. V Now I esteem their mirth and wine Too dear to purchase with my blood; Lord 'tis enough that thou art mine, My life, my portion, and my God. PSALM 73. (S. M.) The Mystery of Providence unfolded. I Sure there's a righteous God, Nor is religion vain, Tho' men of vice may boast aloud, And men of grace complain. II I saw the wicked rise, And felt my heart repine, While haughty fools with scornful eyes In robes of honour shine. III Pamper'd with wanton ease, Their flesh looks full and fair, Their wealth rolls in like flowing seas, And grows without their care. IV Free from the plagues and pains That pious souls endure, Thro' all their life oppression reigns, And racks the humble poor. V Their impious tongues blaspheme The everlasting God; Their malice blasts the good man's name, And spreads their lies abroad. VI But I with flowing tears Indulg'd my doubts to rise; ‘Is there a God that sees or hears ‘The things below the skies?’ VII The tumults of my thought Held me in hard suspense, Till to thy house my feet were brought To learn thy justice thence. VIII Thy word with light and power Did my mistake amend; I view'd the sinners life before, But here I learnt their end. IX On what a slippery steep The thoughtless wretches go, And O that dreadful fiery deep That waits their fall below. X Lord, at thy feet I bow, My thoughts no more repine; I call my God my portion now, And all my powers are thine. This psalm is a most noble composure; the design and model of it is divinely beautiful, and an admirable pattern for a poet to copy; but it being one single scheme of thought, I was obliged to contract it, that it might be sung at once; though the dignity and beauty of the ode suffers much by this means. PSALM 74. (C. M.) The Church pleading with God under sore Persecutions. I Will God for ever cast us off? His wrath for ever smoke Against the people of his love, His little chosen flock? II Think of the tribes so dearly bought With their Redeemer's blood; Nor let thy Sion be forgot, Where once thy glory stood. III Lift up thy feet and march in haste, Aloud our ruin calls; See what a wide and fearful waste Is made within thy walls. IV Where once thy churches pray'd and sang, Thy foes prophanely roar; Over thy gates their ensigns hang, Sad tokens of their power. V How are the seats of worship broke! They tear the buildings down, And he that deals the heaviest stroke Procures the chief renown. VI With flames they threaten to destroy Thy children in their nest; ‘Come let us burn at once,’ they cry, ‘The temple and the priest.’ VII And still to heighten our distress Thy presence is withdrawn; Thy wonted signs of power and grace, Thy power and grace are gone. VIII No prophet speaks to calm our woes, But all the seers mourn; There's not a soul amongst us knows The time of thy return. IX How long, eternal God, how long Shall men of pride blaspheme? Shall saints be made their endless song, And bear immortal shame? X Canst thou for ever sit and hear Thine holy name profan'd? And still thy jealousy forbear, And still withhold thine hand? XI What strange deliverance hast thou shown In ages long before! And now no other God we own, No other God adore. XII Thou didst divide the raging sea, By thy resistless might, To make thy tribes a wondrous way, And then secure their flight. XIII Is not the world of nature thine, The darkness and the day? Didst thou not bid the morning shine, And mark the sun his way? XIV Hath not thy power form'd every coast, And set the earth its bounds, With summer's heat and winter's frost, In their perpetual rounds? XV And shall the sons of earth and dust That sacred power blaspheme? Will not thy hand that form'd them first Avenge thine injur'd name? XVI Think on the covenant thou hast made, And all thy words of love; Nor let the birds of prey invade And vex thy mourning dove. XVII Our foes would triumph in our blood, And make our hope their jest; Plead thy own cause, almighty God! And give thy children rest. PSALM 75. (L. M.) Power and Government from God alone. Applied to the Glorious Revolution by King William, or the happy Accession of King George to the Throne. I To thee, most holy, and most high, To thee, we bring our thankful praise; Thy works declare thy name is nigh, Thy works of wonder and of grace. II Britain was doom'd to be a slave, Her frame dissolv'd, her fears were great; When God a new supporter gave To bear the pillars of the state. III He from thy hand receiv'd his crown, And sware to rule by wholesome laws; His foot shall tread th'oppressor down, His arm defend the righteous cause. IV Let haughty sinners sink their pride, Nor lift so high their scornful head; But lay their foolish thoughts aside, And own the king that God hath made. V Such honours never come by chance Nor do the winds promotion blow; 'Tis God the judge doth one advance, 'Tis God that lays another low. VI No vain pretence to royal birth Shall fix a tyrant on the throne: God the great sovereign of the earth Will rise and make his justice known. VII His hand holds out the dreadful cup Of vengeance, mix'd with various plagues, To make the wicked drink them up, Wring out and taste the bitter dregs. VIII Now shall the Lord exalt the just, And while he tramples on the proud, And lays their glory in the dust, My lips shall sing his praise aloud. PSALM 76. (C. M.) Israel saved, and the Assyrians destroyed; or, God's Vengeance against his Enemies proceeds from his Church. I In Judah God of old was known; His name in Israel great; In Salem stood his holy throne, And Sion was his seat. II Among the praises of his saints His dwelling there he chose; There he receiv'd their just complaints Against their haughty foes. III From Sion went his dreadful word, And broke the threatening spear; The bow, the arrows, and the sword, And crush'd th'Assyrian war. IV What are the earth's wide kingdoms else But mighty hills of prey? The hill on which Jehovah dwells Is glorious more than they. V 'Twas Sion's king that stopp'd the breath Of captains and their bands: The men of might slept fast in death, And never found their hands. VI At thy rebuke, O Jacob's God, Both horse and chariot fell; Who knows the terrors of thy rod? Thy vengeance who can tell? VII What power can stand before thy sight When once thy wrath appears? When heaven shines round with dreadful light, The earth lies still and fears. VIII When God in his own sovereign ways Comes down to save the opprest, The wrath of man shall work his praise, And he'll restrain the rest. IX Vow to the Lord, and tribute bring, Ye princes, fear his frown; His terror shakes the proudest king, And cuts an army down. X The thunder of his sharp rebuke Our haughty foes shall feel; For Jacob's God hath not forsook, But dwells in Sion still. PSALM 77. First Part. (C. M.) Melancholy assaulting, and Hope prevailing. I To God I cry'd with mournful voice, I sought his gracious ear, In the sad day when troubles rose, And fill'd the night with fear. II Sad were my days, and dark my nights, My soul refus'd relief; I thought on God the just and wise, But thoughts increas'd my grief. III Still I complain'd, and still opprest, My heart began to break; My God, thy wrath forbid my rest, And kept my eyes awake. IV My overwhelming sorrows grew Till I could speak no more; Then I within myself withdrew, And call'd thy judgments o'er. V I call'd back years and ancient times, When I beheld thy face; My spirit search'd for secret crimes, That might withhold thy grace. VI I call'd thy mercies to my mind Which I enjoy'd before; And will the Lord no more be kind? His face appear no more? VII Will he for ever cast me off? His promise ever fail? Has he forgot his tender love? Shall anger still prevail? VIII But I forbid this hopeless thought, This dark despairing frame, Rememb'ring what thy hand hath wrought; Thy hand is still the same. IX I'll think again of all thy ways, And talk thy wonders o'er; Thy wonders of recovering grace, When flesh could hope no more. X Grace dwells with justice on the throne; And men that love thy word Have in thy sanctuary known The counsels of the Lord. PSALM 77. Second Part. (C. M.) Comfort derived from Ancient Providence; or, Israel delivered from Egypt, and brought to Canaan. I ‘How awful is thy chastening rod?’ (May thy own children say) ‘The great, the wise, the dreadful God! ‘How holy is his way!’ II I'll meditate his works of old; The King that reigns above; I'll hear his ancient wonders told, And learn to trust his love. III Long did the house of Joseph lie With Egypt's yoke opprest; Long he delay'd to hear their cry, Nor gave his people rest. IV The sons of good old Jacob seem'd Abandon'd to their foes; But his almighty arm redeem'd The nation that he chose. V Israel, his people and his sheep, Must follow where he calls; He bid them venture thro' the deep, And made the waves their walls. VI The waters saw thee, mighty God! The waters saw thee come; Backward they fled, and frighted stood To make thine armies room. VII Strange was thy journey through the sea, Thy footsteps, Lord, unknown: Terrors attend the wonderous way That brings thy mercies down. VIII Thy voice with terror in the sound Thro' clouds and darkness broke; All heaven in lightning shone around, And earth with thunder shook. IX Thine arrows thro' the skies were hurl'd; How glorious is the Lord! Surprise and trembling seiz'd the world, And his own saints ador'd. X He gave them water from the rock; And safe by Moses' hand Thro' a dry desert led his flock Home to the promis'd land. PSALM 78. First Part. (C. M.) Providences of God recorded; or, pious Education and Instruction of Children. I Let children hear the mighty deeds, Which God perform'd of old, Which in our younger years we saw, And which our fathers told. II He bids us make his glories known, His works of power and grace; And we'll convey his wonders down Thro' every rising race. III Our lips shall tell them to our sons, And they again to theirs, That generations yet unborn May teach them to their heirs. IV Thus shall they learn, in God alone Their hope securely stands, That they may ne'er forget his works, But practise his commands. PSALM 78. Second Part. (C. M.) Israel's Rebellion and Punishment; or, the Sins and Chastisements of God's People. I O what a stiff rebellious house Was Jacob's ancient race! False to their own most solemn vows, And to their Maker's grace. II They broke the covenant of his love, And did his laws despise, Forgot the works he wrought to prove His power before their eyes. III They saw the plagues on Egypt light, From his revenging hand: What dreadful tokens of his might Spread o'er the stubborn land! IV They saw him cleave the mighty sea, And march'd in safety through, With watery walls to guard their way, Till they had 'scap'd the foe. V A wonderous pillar mark'd the road, Compos'd of shade and light; By day it prov'd a sheltering cloud, A leading fire by night. VI He from the rock their thirst supply'd; The gushing waters fell, And ran in rivers by their side, A constant miracle. VII Yet they provok'd the Lord most high, And dar'd distrust his hand; ‘Can he with bread our host supply ‘Amidst this desert land?’ VIII The Lord with indignation heard, And caus'd his wrath to flame; His terrors ever stand prepar'd To vindicate his name. PSALM 78. Third Part. (C. M.) The Punishment of Luxury and Intemperance; or, Chastisement and Salvation. I When Israel sins, the Lord reproves, And fills their hearts with dread; Yet he forgives the men he loves, And sends them heavenly bread. II He fed them with a liberal hand, And made his treasures known; He gave the midnight clouds command To pour provision down. III The manna, like a morning shower, Lay thick around their feet; The corn of heaven, so light, so pure, As tho' 'twere angels meat. IV But they in murmuring language said, ‘Manna is all our feast; ‘We loathe this light, this airy bread; ‘We must have flesh to taste.’ V ‘Ye shall have flesh to please your lust,’ The Lord in wrath reply'd, And sent them quails like sand or dust, Heap'd up from side to side. VI He gave them all their own desire; And greedy as they fed, His vengeance burnt with secret fire, And smote the rebels dead. VII When some were slain, the rest return'd, And sought the Lord with tears; Under the rod they fear'd and mourn'd, But soon forgot their fears. VIII Oft he chastis'd, and still forgave, Till by his gracious hand The nation he resolv'd to save, Possess'd the promis'd land. PSALM 78. v. 32, &amp;c. Fourth Part. (L. M.) Backsliding and Forgiveness; or, Sin punished and Saints saved. I Great God, how oft did Israel prove By turns thine anger and thy love? There in a glass our hearts may see How fickle and how false they be. II How soon the faithless Jews forgot The dreadful wonders God had wrought! Then they provoke him to his face, Nor fear his power, nor trust his grace. III The Lord consum'd their years in pain, And made their travels long and vain; A tedious march through unknown ways Wore out their strength, and spent their days. IV Oft when they saw their brethren slain, They mourn'd and sought their Lord again; Call'd him the rock of their abode, Their high Redeemer and their God. V Their prayers and vows before him rise As flattering words or solemn lies, While their rebellious tempers prove False to his covenant and his love. VI Yet did his sovereign grace forgive The men who not deserv'd to live; His anger oft away he turn'd, Or else with gentle flame it burn'd. VII He saw their flesh was weak and frail, He saw temptations still prevail; The God of Abraham lov'd them still, And led them to his holy hill. PSALM 80. (L. M.) The Church's Prayer under Affliction; or, the Vineyard of God wasted. I Great Shepherd of thine Israel, Who didst between the cherubs dwell, And lead the tribes, thy chosen sheep, Safe through the desert and the deep: II Thy church is in the desert now, Shine from on high and guide us thro'; Turn us to thee, thy love restore, We shall be sav'd, and sigh no more. III Great God, whom heavenly hosts obey, How long shall we lament, and pray, And wait in vain thy kind return? How long shall thy fierce anger burn? IV Instead of wine and cheerful bread, Thy saints with their own tears are fed; Turn us to thee, thy love restore, We shall be sav'd, and sigh no more. V Hast thou not planted with thy hands A lovely vine in heathen lands? Did not thy power defend it round, And heavenly dews enrich the ground? VI How did the spreading branches shoot, And bless the nations with the fruit! But now, dear Lord, look down and see Thy mourning vine, that lovely tree. VII Why is its beauty thus defac'd? Why hast thou laid her fences waste? Strangers and foes against her join, And every beast devours the vine. VIII Return, almighty God, return, Nor let thy bleeding vineyard mourn; Turn us to thee, thy love restore, We shall be sav'd, and sigh no more. IX Lord, when this vine in Canaan grew Thou wast its strength and glory too; Attack'd in vain by all its foes Till the fair Branch of Promise rose; X Fair branch, ordain'd of old to shoot From David's stock, from Jacob's root; Himself a noble vine, and we The lesser branches of the tree. XI 'Tis thy own Son; and he shall stand Girt with thy strength at thy right hand; Thy first-born Son, adorn'd and blest With power and grace above the rest. XII O! for his sake attend our cry, Shine on thy churches lest they die; Turn us to thee, thy love restore, We shall be sav'd, and sigh no more. PSALM 81. v. 1, 8–16. (S. M.) The Warnings of God to his People; or, spiritual Blessings and Punishments. I Sing to the Lord aloud, And make a joyful noise; God is our strength, our Saviour-God; Let Israel hear his voice. II ‘From vile idolatry ‘Preserve my worship clean; ‘I am the Lord who set thee free ‘From slavery and sin. III ‘Stretch thy desires abroad, ‘And I'll supply them well; ‘But if ye will refuse your God, ‘If Israel will rebel, IV ‘I'll leave them,’ saith the Lord, ‘To their own lusts a prey, ‘And let them run the dangerous road; ‘'Tis their own chosen way. V ‘Yet, O! that all my saints ‘Would hearken to my voice! ‘Soon I would ease their sore complaints, ‘And bid their hearts rejoice. VI ‘While I destroy their foes, ‘I'd richly feed my flock, ‘And they should taste the stream that flows ‘From their eternal rock.’ PSALM 82. (L. M.) God the Supreme Governor; or, Magistrates warned. I Among th'assemblies of the great, A greater Ruler takes his seat; The God of heaven, as Judge, surveys Those gods on earth, and all their ways. II Why will ye then frame wicked laws? Or why support th'unrighteous cause? When will ye once defend the poor, That sinners vex the saints no more? III They know not, Lord, nor will they know, Dark are the ways in which they go; Their name of earthly gods is vain, For they shall fall and die like men. IV Arise, O Lord, and let thy Son Possess his universal throne, And rule the nations with his rod; He is our Judge, and he our God. The last verse of this psalm may not improperly be applied to Christ; for he is that God who must judge the earth, Psalm xcvi. and xcviii. and have the nations for his inheritance, Psalm ii. 8. PSALM 83. (S. M.) A Complaint against Persecutors. I And will the God of grace Perpetual silence keep? The God of justice hold his peace, And let his vengeance sleep? II Behold what cursed snares The men of mischief spread; The men that hate thy saints and thee Lift up their threatening head. III Against thy hidden ones Their counsels they employ, And malice, with her watchful eye, Pursues them to destroy. IV The noble and the base Into thy pastures leap; The lion and the stupid ass Conspire to vex thy sheep. V ‘Come let us join,’ they cry, ‘To root them from the ground, ‘Till not the name of saints remain, ‘Nor memory shall be found.’ VI Awake, almighty God, And call thy wrath to mind; Give them like forests to the fire, Or stubble to the wind. VII Convince their madness, Lord, And make them seek thy name; Or else their stubborn rage confound, That they may die in shame. VIII Then shall the nations know That glorious dreadful word, Jehovah is thy name alone, And thou the sovereign Lord. PSALM 84. First Part. (L. M.) The Pleasure of Public Worship. I How pleasant, how divinely fair, O Lord of hosts, thy dwellings are! With long desire my spirit faints To meet th'assemblies of thy saints. II My flesh would rest in thine abode, My panting heart cries out for God; My God! my King! why should I be So far from all my joys and thee? III The sparrow chooses where to rest, And for her young provides her nest: But will my God to sparrows grant That pleasure which his children want? IV Blest are the saints who sit on high, Around thy throne of majesty; Thy brightest glories shine above, And all their work is praise and love. V Blest are the souls that find a place Within the temple of thy grace; There they behold thy gentler rays, And seek thy face, and learn thy praise. VI Blest are the men whose hearts are set To find the way to Sion's gate; God is their strength, and through the road They lean upon their helper God. VII Cheerful they walk with growing strength, Till all shall meet in heaven at length, Till all before thy face appear, And join in nobler worship there. PSALM 84. Second Part. (L. M.) God and his Church; or, Grace and Glory. I Great God, attend while Sion sings The joy that from thy presence springs; To spend one day with thee on earth Exceeds a thousand days of mirth. II Might I enjoy the meanest place Within thine house, O God of grace, Not tents of ease, nor thrones of power, Should tempt my feet to leave thy door. III God is our sun, he makes our day; God is our shield, he guards our way From all th'assaults of hell and sin, From foes without, and foes within. IV All needful grace will God bestow, And crown that grace with glory too; He gives us all things, and withholds No real good from upright souls. V O God, our King, whose sovereign sway The glorious hosts of heaven obey, And devils at thy presence flee, Blest is the man that trusts in thee. PSALM 84. v. 1, 4, 2, 3, 10. Paraphrased. (C. M.) Delight in Ordinances of Worship; or, God present in his Churches. I My soul, how lovely is the place To which thy God resorts! 'Tis heaven to see his smiling face, Tho' in his earthly courts. II There the great Monarch of the skies His saving power displays, And light breaks in upon our eyes With kind and quickening rays. III With his rich gifts the heavenly Dove Descends and fills the place, While Christ reveals his wondrous love, And sheds abroad his grace. IV There, mighty God, thy words declare The secrets of thy will; And still we seek thy mercy there, And sing thy praises still. V My heart and flesh cry out for thee, While far from thine abode; When shall I tread thy courts, and see My Saviour and my God? VI The sparrow builds herself a nest, And suffers no remove; O make me, like the sparrows, blest, To dwell but where I love. VII To sit one day beneath thine eye, And hear thy gracious voice, Exceeds a whole eternity Employ'd in carnal joys. VIII Lord, at thy threshold I would wait, While Jesus is within, Rather than fill a throne of state, Or live in tents of sin. IX Could I command the spacious land, And the more boundless sea, For one blest hour at thy right hand I'd give them both away. PSALM 84. As the 148th Psalm. Longing for the House of God. I Lord of the worlds above, How pleasant and how fair The dwellings of thy love, Thy earthly temples are! To thine abode My heart aspires, With warm desires, To see my God. II The sparrow, for her young, With pleasure seeks a nest; And wandering swallows long To find their wonted rest: My spirit faints, With equal zeal, To rise and dwell Among thy saints. III O happy souls that pray Where God appoints to hear! O happy men that pay Their constant service there! They praise thee still; And happy they That love the way To Zion's hill. IV They go from strength to strength, Thro' this dark vale of tears, Till each arrives at length, Till each in heav'n appears: O glorious seat, When God our King Shall thither bring Our willing feet! V To spend one sacred day, Where God and saints abide, Affords diviner joy Than thousand days beside: Where God resorts, I love it more To keep the door Than shine in courts. IV God is our sun and shield, Our light and our defence; With gifts his hands are fill'd, We draw our blessings thence: He shall bestow On Jacob's race Peculiar grace And glory too. VII The Lord his people loves; His hand no good withholds From those his heart approves, From pure and pious souls: Thrice happy he, O God of hosts, Whose spirit trusts Alone in thee. PSALM 85. v. 1–8. First Part. (L. M.) Waiting for an Answer to Prayer; or, Deliverance begun and completed. I Lord, thou hast call'd thy grace to mind, Thou hast revers'd our heavy doom; So God forgave when Israel sinn'd, And brought his wandering captives home. II Thou hast begun to set us free, And made thy fiercest wrath abate; Now let our hearts be turn'd to thee, And thy salvation be complete. III Revive our dying graces, Lord, And let thy saints in thee rejoice; Make known thy truth, fulfil thy word, We wait for praise to tune our voice. IV We wait to hear what God will say; He'll speak, and give his people peace; But let them run no more astray, Lest his returning wrath increase. PSALM 85. v. 9, &amp;c. Second Part. (L. M.) Salvation by Christ. I Salvation is for ever nigh The souls that fear and trust the Lord; And grace, descending from on high, Fresh hopes of glory shall afford. II Mercy and truth on earth are met, Since Christ the Lord came down from heaven; By his obedience, so complete, Justice is pleas'd, and peace is given. III Now truth and honour shall abound, Religion dwell on earth again, And heavenly influence bless the ground In our Redeemer's gentle reign. IV His righteousness is gone before To give us free access to God; Our wandering feet shall stray no more, But mark his steps and keep the road. If some readers should suppose the English verse here to mistake the Hebrew sense, yet perhaps these evangelical allusions to the words of the jewish psalmist, may be as agreeable and useful to the christian worshippers. PSALM 86. v. 8–13. (C. M.) A general Song of Praise to God. I Among the princes, earthly gods, There's none hath power divine; Nor is their nature, mighty Lord, Nor are their works like thine. II The nations thou hast made shall bring Their offerings round thy throne; For thou alone dost wonderous things, For thou art God alone. III Lord, I would walk with holy feet; Teach me thine heavenly ways, And my poor scattered thoughts unite In God my father's praise. IV Great is thy mercy, and my tongue Shall those sweet wonders tell, How by thy grace my sinking soul Rose from the deeps of hell. PSALM 87. (L. M.) The Church the Birth-place of the Saints; or, Jews and Gentiles united in the Christian Church. I God in his earthly temple lays Foundations for his heavenly praise: He likes the tents of Jacob well, But still in Zion loves to dwell. II His mercy visits every house That pay their night and morning vows; But makes a more delightful stay Where churches meet to praise and pray. III What glories were describ'd of old! What wonders are of Zion told! Thou city of our God below, Thy fame shall Tyre and Egypt know. IV Egypt and Tyre, and Greek and Jew, Shall there begin their lives anew: Angels and men shall join to sing The hill where living waters spring. V When God makes up his last account Of natives in his holy mount, 'Twill be an honour to appear As one new-born or nourish'd there! I have explained the second verse at large, and transposed the last. For singers and players on instruments, I have introduced angels with men. PSALM 89. First Part. (L. M.) The Covenant made with Christ; or, the true David. I For ever shall my song record The truth and mercy of the Lord; Mercy and truth for ever stand, Like heaven establish'd by his hand. II Thus to his Son he sware, and said, ‘With thee my covenant first is made; ‘In thee shall dying sinners live, ‘Glory and grace are thine to give. III ‘Be thou my prophet, thou my priest; ‘Thy children shall be ever blest; ‘Thou art my chosen king; thy throne ‘Shall stand eternal like my own. IV ‘There's none of all my sons above ‘So much my image or my love; ‘Celestial powers thy subjects are, ‘Then what can earth to thee compare? V ‘David, my servant whom I chose ‘To guard my flock, to crush my foes, ‘And rais'd him to the jewish throne, ‘Was but a shadow of my Son.’ VI Now let the church rejoice, and sing Jesus her Saviour and her King: Angels his heavenly wonders show, And saints declare his works below. PSALM 89. First Part. (C. M.) The Faithfulness of God. I My never-ceasing songs shall show The mercies of the Lord, And make succeeding ages know How faithful is his word. II The sacred truths his lips pronounce Shall firm as heaven endure; And if he speak a promise once, Th'eternal grace is sure. III How long the race of David held The promis'd jewish throne! But there's a nobler covenant seal'd To David's greater Son. IV His seed for ever shall possess A throne above the skies; The meanest subject of his grace Shall to that glory rise. V Lord God of hosts, thy wondrous ways Are sung by saints above; And saints on earth their honours raise To thy unchanging love. PSALM 89. v. 7, &amp;c. Second Part. (C. M.) The Power and Majesty of God; or, reverential Worship. I With reverence let the saints appear And bow before the Lord, His high commands with reverence hear, And tremble at his word. II How terrible thy glories be! How bright thine armies shine! Where is the power that vies with thee? Or truth compar'd to thine? III The northern pole and southern rest On thy supporting hand; Darkness and day from east to west Move round at thy command. IV Thy words the raging wind control, And rule the boisterous deep; Thou mak'st the sleeping billows roll, The rolling billows sleep. V Heaven, earth, and air, and sea are thine, And the dark world of hell; How did thine arm in vengeance shine When Egypt durst rebel! VI Justice and judgment are thy throne, Yet wondrous is thy grace; While truth and mercy join'd in one Invite us near thy face. I have here transposed the verses a little, to make the connexion plainer. PSALM 89. v. 15, &amp;c. Third Part. (C. M.) A blessed Gospel. I Blest are the souls that hear and know The gospel's joyful sound; Peace shall attend the path they go, And light their steps surround. II Their joy shall bear their spirits up Through their Redeemer's name; His righteousness exalts their hope, Nor Satan dares condemn. III The Lord, our glory and defence, Strength and salvation gives; Israel, thy King for ever reigns, Thy God for ever lives. PSALM 89. v. 19, &amp;c. Fourth Part. (C. M.) Christ's mediatorial Kingdom; or, his divine and human Nature. I Hear what the Lord in vision said, And made his mercy known: ‘Sinners, behold your help his laid ‘On my almighty Son. II ‘Behold the man my wisdom chose ‘Among your mortal race; ‘His head my holy oil o'erflows, ‘The Spirit of my grace. III ‘High shall he reign on David's throne, ‘My people's better King; ‘My arm shall beat his rivals down, ‘And still new subjects bring. IV ‘My truth shall guard him in his way, ‘With mercy by his side, ‘While in my name thro' earth and sea ‘He shall in triumph ride. V ‘Me for his Father and his God ‘He shall for ever own, ‘Call me his rock, his high abode; ‘And I'll support my Son. VI ‘My first-born Son array'd in grace ‘At my right hand shall sit; ‘Beneath him angels know their place, ‘And monarchs at his feet. VII ‘My covenant stands for ever fast, ‘My promises are strong; ‘Firm as the heavens his throne shall last, ‘His seed endure as long.’ PSALM 89. v. 30, &amp;c. Fifth Part. (C. M.) The Covenant of Grace unchangeable; or, Afflictions without Rejection. I ‘Yet,’ saith the Lord, ‘if David's race, ‘The children of my Son, ‘Should break my laws, abuse my grace, ‘And tempt mine anger down; II ‘Their sins I'll visit with the rod, ‘And make their folly smart; ‘But I'll not cease to be their God, ‘Nor from my truth depart. III ‘My covenant I will ne'er revoke, ‘But keep my grace in mind; ‘And what eternal love hath spoke ‘Eternal truth shall bind. IV ‘Once have I sworn (I need no more) ‘And pledg'd my holiness ‘To seal the sacred promise sure ‘To David and his race. V ‘The sun shall see his offspring rise ‘And spread from sea to sea, ‘Long as he travels round the skies ‘To give the nations day. VI ‘Sure as the moon that rules the night ‘His kingdom shall endure, ‘Till the fix'd laws of shade and light ‘Shall be observ'd no more.’ PSALM 89. v. 47, &amp;c. Sixth Part. (L. M.) Mortality and Hope. A Funeral Psalm. I Remember, Lord, our mortal state, How frail our life! how short the date! Where is the man that draws his breath Safe from disease, secure from death? II Lord, while we see whole nations die, Our flesh and sense repine and cry, ‘Must death for ever rage and reign? ‘Or hast thou made mankind in vain? III ‘Where is thy promise to the just? ‘Are not thy servants turn'd to dust?’ But faith forbids these mournful sighs, And sees the sleeping dust arise. IV That glorious hour, that dreadful day Wipes the reproach of saints away, And clears the honour of thy word; Awake, our souls, and bless the Lord. PSALM 89. v. 47, &amp;c. Last Part. As the 113th Psalm. Life, Death, and the Resurrection. I Think, mighty God, on feeble man, How few his hours, how short his span! Short from the cradle to the grave: Who can secure his vital breath Against the bold demands of death, With skill to fly, or power to save? II Lord, shall it be for ever said, ‘The race of man was only made ‘For sickness, sorrow, and the dust?’ Are not thy servants day by day Sent to their graves, and turn'd to clay? Lord, where's thy kindness to the just. III Hast thou not promis'd to thy Son And all his seed a heavenly crown? But flesh and sense indulge despair; For ever blessed be the Lord That faith can read his holy word, And find a resurrection there. IV For ever blessed be the Lord, Who gives his saints a long reward For all their toil, reproach and pain; Let all below and all above Join to proclaim thy wondrous love, And each repeat their loud Amen. PSALM 90. (L. M.) Man mortal, and God eternal. A mournful Song at a Funeral. I Thro' every age, eternal God, Thou art our rest, our safe abode; High was thy throne ere heaven was made, Or earth thy humble footstool laid. II Long hadst thou reign'd ere time began, Or dust was fashion'd to a man; And long thy kingdom shall endure When earth and time shall be no more. III But man, weak man is born to die, Made up of guilt and vanity: Thy dreadful sentence, Lord, was just, ‘Return, ye sinners, to your dust.’ IV A thousand of our years amount Scarce to a day in thine account; Like yesterday's departed light, Or the last watch of ending night. V Death like an overflowing stream Sweeps us away; our life's a dream, An empty tale; a morning flower Cut down and wither'd in an hour. VI Our age to seventy years is set; How short the term! how frail the state! And if to eighty we arrive, We rather sigh and groan than live. VII But O how oft thy wrath appears, And cuts off our expected years! Thy wrath awakes our humble dread; We fear the power that strikes us dead. VIII Teach us, O Lord, how frail is man; And kindly lengthen out our span, Till a wise care of piety Fit us to die, and dwell with thee. PSALM 90. v. 1–5. First Part. (C. M.) Man frail, and God eternal. I Our God, our help in ages past, Our hope for years to come, Our shelter from the stormy blast, And our eternal home. II Under the shadow of thy throne Thy saints have dwelt secure; Sufficient is thine arm alone, And our defence is sure. III Before the hills in order stood, Or earth receiv'd her frame, From everlasting thou art God, To endless years the same. IV Thy word commands our flesh to dust, ‘Return, ye sons of men:’ All nations rose from earth at first, And turn to earth again. V A thousand ages in thy sight Are like an evening gone; Short as the watch that ends the night Before the rising sun. VI The busy tribes of flesh and blood, With all their lives and cares, Are carry'd downwards by thy flood, And lost in following years. VII Time like an ever-rolling stream Bears all its sons away; They fly forgotten as a dream Dies at the opening day. VIII Like flowery fields the nations stand Pleas'd with the morning light; The flowers beneath the mower's hand Lie withering ere 'tis night. IX Our God, our help in ages past, Our hope for years to come, Be thou our guard while troubles last, And our eternal home. PSALM 90. v. 8, 11, 9, 10, 12. Second Part. (C. M.) Infirmities and Mortality the Effect of Sin; or, Life, old Age, and Preparation for Death. I Lord, if thine eyes survey our faults, And justice grow severe, Thy dreadful wrath exceeds our thoughts, And burns beyond our fear. II Thine anger turns our frame to dust; By one offence to thee Adam with all his sons have lost Their immortality. III Life like a vain amusement flies, A fable or a song; By swift degrees our nature dies, Nor can our joys be long. IV 'Tis but a few whose days amount To threescore years and ten; And all beyond that short account Is sorrow, toil, and pain. V Our vitals with laborious strife Bear up the crazy load, And drag those poor remains of life Along the tiresome road. VI Almighty God, reveal thy love, And not thy wrath alone; O let our sweet experience prove The mercies of thy throne! VII Our souls would learn the heavenly art T'improve the hours we have, That we may act the wiser part, And live beyond the grave. PSALM 90. v. 13, &amp;c. Third Part. (C. M.) Breathing after Heaven. I Return, O God of love, return; Earth is a tiresome place: How long shall we thy children mourn Our absence from thy face? II Let heaven succeed our painful years, Let sin and sorrow csase, And in proportion to our tears So make our joys increase. III Thy wonders to thy servants show, Make thy own work complete, Then shall our souls thy glory know, And own thy love was great. IV Then shall we shine before thy throne In all thy beauty, Lord; And the poor service we have done Meet a divine reward. PSALM 90. v. 5, 10, 12. (S. M.) The Frailty and Shortness of Life. I Lord, what a feeble piece Is this our mortal frame! Our life how poor a trifle 'tis, That scarce deserves the name! II Alas! the brittle clay That built our body first! And every month, and every day, 'Tis mouldering back to dust. III Our moments fly apace, Nor will our minutes stay; Just like a flood our hasty days Are sweeping us away. IV Well, if our days must fly, We'll keep their end in sight, We'll spend them all in wisdom's way, And let them speed their flight. V They'll waft us sooner o'er This life's tempestuous sea; Soon we shall reach the peaceful shore Of blest eternity. PSALM 91. v. 1–7. First Part. (L.M.) Safety in public Diseases and Dangers. I He that hath made his refuge God, Shall find a most secure abode, Shall walk all day beneath his shade, And there at night shall rest his head. II Then will I say, ‘My God, thy power ‘Shall be my fortress and my tower; ‘I that am form'd of feeble dust ‘Make thine almighty arm my trust.’ III Thrice happy man! thy Maker's care Shall keep thee from the fowler's snare Satan, the fowler, who betrays Unguarded souls a thousand ways. IV Just as a hen protects her brood From birds of prey that seek their blood Under her feathers, so the Lord Makes his own arm his people's guard. V If burning beams of noon conspire To dart a pestilential fire, God is their life; his wings are spread To shield them with an healthful shade: VI If vapours with malignant breath Rise thick, and scatter midnight death, Israel is safe: the poison'd air Grows pure, if Israel's God be there. VII What tho' a thousand at thy side, At thy right hand ten thousand dy'd, Thy God his chosen people saves Amongst the dead, amidst the graves. VIII So when he sent his angel down To make his wrath in Egypt known, And slew their sons, his careful eye Pass'd all the doors of Jacob by. IX But if the fire, or plague, or sword, Receive commission from the Lord To strike his saints among the rest, Their very pains and deaths are blest. X The sword, the pestilence or fire Shall but fulfil their best desire, From sins and sorrows set them free, And bring thy children, Lord, to thee. See the notes on the xlist psalm. PSALM 91. v. 9–16. Second Part. (C. M.) Protection from Death, Guard of Angels, Victory and Deliverance. I Ye sons of men, a feeble race, Expos'd to every snare, Come, make the Lord your dwelling-place, And try and trust his care. II No ill shall enter where you dwell; Or if the plague come nigh, And sweep the wicked down to hell, 'Twill raise his saints on high. III He'll give his angels charge to keep Your feet in all their ways; To watch your pillow while you sleep, And guard your happy days. IV Their hands shall bear you, lest you fall And dash against the stones: Are they not servants at his call, And sent t'attend his sons? V Adders and lions ye shall tread; The tempter's wiles defeat; He that hath broke the serpent's head Puts him beneath your feet. VI ‘Because on me they set their love ‘I'll save them,’ saith the Lord; ‘I'll bear their joyful souls above ‘Destruction and the sword. VII ‘My grace shall answer when they call; ‘In trouble I'll be nigh; ‘My power shall help them when they fall, ‘And raise them when they die. VIII ‘Those that on earth my name have known, ‘I'll honour them in heaven; ‘There my salvation shall be shown, ‘And endless life be given.’ PSALM 92. First Part. (L. M.) A Psalm for the Lord's Day. I Sweet is the work, my God, my King, To praise thy name, give thanks and sing, To shew thy love by morning light, And talk of all thy truth at night. II Sweet is the day of sacred rest, No mortal cares shall seize my breast; O may my heart in tune be found Like David's harp of solemn sound! III My heart shall triumph in my Lord, And bless his works, and bless his word; Thy works of grace how bright they shine! How deep thy counsels! how divine! IV Fools never raise their thoughts so high; Like brutes they live, like brutes they die; Like grass they flourish, till thy breath Blast them in everlasting death. V But I shall share a glorious part When grace hath well refin'd my heart, And fresh supplies of joy are shed, Like holy oil, to cheer my head. VI Sin (my worst enemy before) Rejoicing in the destruction of our personal enemies is not so evangelical a practice; therefore I have given the 11th verse of this psalm another turn. See the notes on the third psalm. Shall vex my eyes and ears no more; My inward foes shall all be slain, Nor Satan break my peace again. VII Then shall I see, and hear, and know All I desir'd or wish'd below; And every power find sweet employ In that eternal world of joy. PSALM 92. v. 12, &amp;c. Second Part. (L. M.) The Church is the Garden of God. I Lord, 'tis a pleasant thing to stand In garden's planted by thine hand; Let me within thy courts be seen Like a young cedar fresh and green. II There grow thy saints in faith and love, Blest with thine influence from above; Not Lebanon with all its trees Yields such a comely sight as these. III The plants of grace shall ever live; (Nature decays, but grace must thrive) Time, that doth all things else impair, Still makes them flourish strong and fair. IV Laden with fruits of age they shew The Lord is holy, just and true; None that attend his gates shall find A God unfaithful or unkind. PSALM 93. First Metre. As the 100th Psalm. The Eternal and Sovereign God. I Jehovah reigns; he dwells in light, Girded with majesty and might: The world created by his hands Still on its first foundation stands. II But ere this spacious world was made, Or had its first foundation laid, Thy throne eternal ages stood, Thyself the ever-living God. III Like floods the angry nations rise, And aim their rage against the skies; Vain floods that aim their rage so high! At thy rebuke the billows die. IV For ever shall thy throne endure; Thy promise stands for ever sure; And everlasting holiness Becomes the dwellings of thy grace. PSALM 93. Second Metre. As the old 50th Psalm. The Eternal and Sovereign God. I The Lord of glory reigns; he reigns on high; His robes of state are strength and majesty: This wide creation rose at his command, Built by his word, and stablish'd by his hand: Long stood his throne ere he began creation, And his own Godhead is the firm foundation. II God is the th'eternal King: Thy foes in vain Raise their rebellions to confound thy reign: In vain the storms, in vain the floods arise, And roar, and toss their waves against the skies; Foaming at heaven, they rage with wild commotion, But heaven's high arches scorn the swelling ocean. III Ye tempests, rage no more; ye floods, be still; And the mad world submissive to his will: Built on his truth his church must ever stand; Firm are his promises, and strong his hand: See his own sons, when they appear before him, Bow at his footstool, and with fear adore him. PSALM 93. Third Metre. As the old 122d Psalm. The Eternal and Sovereign God. I The Lord Jehovah reigns, And royal state maintains, His head with awful glories crown'd; Array'd in robes of light, Begirt with sovereign might, And rays of majesty around. II Upheld by thy commands The world securely stands; And skies and stars obey thy word: Thy throne was fix'd on high Before the starry sky; Eternal is thy kingdom, Lord. III In vain the noisy crowd, Like billows fierce and loud, Against thine empire rage and roar; In vain, with angry spite, The surly nations fight, And dash like waves against the shore. IV Let floods and nations rage, And all their powers engage, Let swelling tides assault the sky, The terrors of thy frown Shall beat their madness down; Thy throne for ever stands on high. V Thy promises are true, Thy grace is ever new; There fix'd thy church shall ne'er remove: Thy saints with holy fear Shall in thy courts appear, And sing thine everlasting love. Repeat the fourth stanza to complete the old tune. PSALM 94. v. 1, 2, 7–14. First Part. (C. M.) Saints chastised, and Sinners destroyed; or, instructive Afflictions. I O God, to whom revenge belongs, Proclaim thy wrath aloud; Let sovereign power redress our wrongs, Let justice smite the proud. II They say, ‘The Lord nor sees nor hears;’ When will the fools be wise! Can he be deaf who form'd their ears? Or blind, who made their eyes? III He knows their impious thoughts are vain, And they shall feel his power; His wrath shall pierce their souls with pain In some surprising hour. IV But if thy saints deserve rebuke, Thou hast a gentler rod; Thy providences and thy book Shall make them know their God. V Blest is the man thy hands chastise, And to his duty draw; Thy scourges make thy children wise When they forget thy law. VI But God will ne'er cast off his saints, Nor his own promise break; He pardons his inheritance For their Redeemer's sake. PSALM 94. v. 16–23. Second Part. (C. M.) God our Support and Comfort; or, Deliverance from Temptation and Persecution. I Who will arise and plead my right Against my numerous foes, While earth and hell their force unite, And all my hopes oppose? II Had not the Lord, my rock, my help, Sustain'd my fainting head, My life had now in silence dwelt, My soul amongst the dead. III ‘Alas! my sliding feet,’ I cry'd; ‘Thy promise was my prop; Thy grace stood constant by my side, Thy Spirit bore me up. IV While multitudes of mournful thoughts Within my bosom roll, Thy boundless love forgives my faults, Thy comforts cheer my soul. V Powers of iniquity may rise, And frame pernicious laws; But God, my refuge, rules the skies, He will defend my cause. VI Let malice vent her rage aloud, Let bold blasphemers scoff; The Lord our God shall judge the proud, And cut the sinners off. PSALM 95. (C. M.) A Psalm before Prayer. I Sing to the Lord Jehovah's name, And in his strength rejoice; When his salvation is our theme, Exalted be our voice. II With thanks approach his awful sight, And psalms of honour sing; The Lord's a God of boundless might, The whole creation's King. III Let princes hear, let angels know, Angels and magistrates are those Elohim, or gods, above which the true God is so often exalted in this Book of Psalms. How mean their natures seem, Those gods on high, and gods below, When once compar'd with him. IV Earth with its caverns dark and deep Lies in his spacious hand; He fix'd the seas what bounds to keep, And where the hills must stand. V Come, and with humble souls adore, Come, kneel before his face; O may the creatures of his power Be children of his grace! VI Now is the time: he bends his ear, And waits for your request; Come, lest he rouse his wrath and swear ‘Ye shall not see my rest.’ PSALM 95. (S. M.) A Psalm before Sermon. I Come, sound his praise abroad, And hymns of glory sing; Jehovah is the sovereign God, The universal King. II He form'd the deeps unknown; He gave the seas their bound; The watery worlds are all his own, And all the solid ground. III Come, worship at his throne, Come, bow before the Lord: We are his works, and not our own; He form'd us by his word. IV To-day attend his voice, Nor dare provoke his rod; Come, like the people of his choice, And own your gracious God. V But if your ears refuse The language of his grace, And hearts grow hard, like stubborn Jews, That unbelieving race; VI The Lord in vengeance drest Will lift his hand and swear, ‘You that despise my promis'd rest ‘Shall have no portion there.’ PSALM 95. v. 1, 2, 3, 6–11. (L. M.) Canaan lost through unbelief; or, a Warning to delaying Sinners. I Come, let our voices join to raise A sacred song of solemn praise; God is a sovereign King; rehearse His honours in exalted verse. II Come, let our souls address the Lord, Who fram'd our natures with his word; He is our shepherd; we the sheep His mercy chose, his pastures keep. III Come, let us hear his voice to-day, The counsels of his love obey; Nor let our harden'd hearts renew The sins and plagues that Israel knew. IV Israel, that saw his works of grace, Yet tempt their Maker to his face; A faithless unbelieving brood That tir'd the patience of their God. V Thus saith the Lord, ‘How false they prove! ‘Forget my power, abuse my love; ‘Since they despise my rest, I swear, ‘Their feet shall never enter there.’ VI Look back, my soul, with holy dread, And view those ancient rebels dead; Attend the offer'd grace to-day, Nor lose the blessing by delay. VII Seize the kind promise while it waits, And march to Zion's heavenly gates; Believe, and take the promis'd rest; Obey, and be for ever blest. In the third and fourth chapter to the Hebrews several verses of this psalm are cited, and given for a caution to christians. I have applied them the same way in the two last stanzas. PSALM 96. v. 1, 10, &amp;c. (C. M.) Christ's First and Second Coming. I Sing to the Lord, ye distant lands, Ye tribes of every tongue; His new discover'd grace demands A new and nobler song. II Say to the nations, Jesus reigns, God's own almighty Son; His power the sinking world sustains, And grace surrounds his throne. III Let heaven proclaim the joyful day, Joy through the earth be seen; Let cities shine in bright array, And fields in cheerful green. IV Let an unusual joy surprise Mountains sinking, and vallies rising; that is, pride humbled, and the humble raised, are the preparations of Christ's kingdom, Luke iii. 4, 5. The islands of the sea: Ye mountains, sink, ye valleys, rise, Prepare the Lord his way. V Behold he comes, he comes to bless The nations as their God; To shew the world his righteousness, And send his truth abroad. VI But when his voice shall raise the dead, And bid the world draw near, How will the guilty nations dread To see their Judge appear! In this and the two following psalms, the first coming of Christ into the world is represented in a prophetic style, as though he were coming the second time to the last judgment: But that Christ's incarnation, his setting up his gospel kingdom to judge or rule the gentiles, and the judgment and destruction of the heathen idols, is the true design of these three psalms, is evident from several expressions in them: And particularly because the earth, the fields, the sea, &amp;c. are called to rejoice; whereas the final judgment of the world is represented dreadful to all nature, and to the nations of the earth. See Rev. xvii. and Rev. xx. 11. and 2 Pet. iii. 7, 10. Yet, since this last coming has something in it parallel to his first, I have in the different parts of the psalms referred to both. PSALM 96. As the 113th Psalm. The God of the Gentiles. I Let all the earth their voices raise To sing the choicest psalm of praise, To sing and bless Jehovah's name: His glory let the heathens know, His wonders to the nations show, And all his saving works proclaim. II The heathens know thy glory, Lord; The wondering nations read thy word, In Britain is Jehovah known: Our worship shall no more be paid To gods which mortal hands have made; Our Maker is our God alone. III He fram'd the globe, he built the sky, He made the shining worlds on high, And reigns complete in glory there: His beams are majesty and light; His beauties how divinely bright! His temple how divinely fair! IV Come the great day, the glorious hour, When earth shall feel his saving power, And barbarous nations fear his name; Then shall the race of man confess The beauty of his holiness, And in his courts his grace proclaim. PSALM 97. v. 1–5. First Part. (L. M.) Christ reigning in Heaven, and coming to Judgment. I He reigns; the Lord, the Saviour reigns; Praise him in evangelic strains; Let the whole earth in songs rejoice, And distant islands join their voice. II Deep are his counsels and unknown; But grace and truth support his throne: Tho' gloomy clouds his ways surround, Justice is their eternal ground. III In robes of judgment, lo! he comes, Shakes the wide earth, and cleaves the tombs; Before him burns devouring fire, The mountains melt, the seas retire. IV His enemies, with sore dismay, Fly from the sight, and shun the day; Then lift your heads, ye saints, on high, And sing, for your redemption's nigh. Though the kingdom of Christ, in the two first stanzas, be matter of joy to all nations, yet his coming to judgment in the two last, is joy only to the saints. As this psalm introduces Zion and Judah rejoicing, verse 8. so Christ bids his apostles lift up their heads, &amp;c. Luke xxi. 28. PSALM 97. v. 6–9. Second Part. (L. M.) Christ's Incarnation. I The Lord is come, the heavens proclaim His birth; the nations learn his name; An unknown star directs the road Of eastern sages to their God. II All ye bright armies of the skies, Go, worship where the Saviour lies: Angels and kings before him bow, Those gods on high, and gods below. III Let idols totter to the ground, And their own worshippers confound; But Judah shout, but Zion sing, And earth confess her sovereign King. This psalm foretels the incarnation of Christ. For the words of the seventh verse, worship him all ye gods, are translated, Heb. i. 6. Let all the angels of God worship him. By this divine hint I was directed to compose this Hymn, and to introduce the star that shone at his birth as a part of the proclamation of him in the heavens, verse 6. See more, notes on Psalm xcv. common metre. PSALM 97. Third Part. (L. M.) Grace and Glory. I Th' Almighty reigns exalted high O'er all the earth, o'er all the sky; Tho' clouds and darkness veil his feet, His dwelling is the mercy-seat. II O ye that love his holy name, Hate every work of sin and shame; He guards the souls of all his friends, And from the snares of hell defends. III Immortal light and joys unknown Are for the saints in darkness sown; Those glorious seeds shall spring and rise, And the bright harvest bless our eyes. IV Rejoice, ye righteous, and record The sacred honours of the Lord; None but the soul that feels his grace Can triumph in his holiness. PSALM 97. v. 1, 3, 5–7, 11. (C. M.) Christ's Incarnation, and the last Judgment. I Ye islands of the northern sea, Rejoice, the Saviour reigns; His word, like fire, prepares his way, And mountains melt to plains. II His presence sinks the proudest hills And makes the vallies rise; The humble soul enjoys his smiles, The haughty sinner dies. III The heavens his rightful power proclaim; The idol gods around Fill their own worshippers with shame, And totter to the ground. IV Adoring angels at his birth Make the Redeemer known; Thus shall he come to judge the earth, And angels guard his throne. V His foes shall tremble at his sight, And hills and seas retire; His children take their unknown flight, And leave the world in fire. VI The seeds of joy and glory sown For saints in darkness here Shall rise and spring in worlds unknown, And a rich harvest bear. See the notes on Psalm xcvi. PSALM 98. First Part. (C. M.) Praise for the Gospel. I To our almighty Maker, God, New honours be addrest; His great salvation shines abroad, And makes the nations blest. II He spake the word to Abraham first, His truth fulfils the grace: The gentiles make his name their trust, And learn his righteousness. III Let the whole earth his love proclaim With all her different tongues; And spread the honours of his name In melody and songs. In these two hymns which I have formed out of the xcviiith psalm, I have fully expressed what I esteem to be the first and chief sense of the holy scriptures, both in this and the xcvith psalm, whose conclusions are both alike. PSALM 98. Second Part. (C. M.) The Messiah's Coming and Kingdom. I Joy to the world; the Lord is come; Let earth receive her King; Let every heart prepare him room, And heaven and nature sing. II Joy to the earth, the Saviour reigns; Let men their songs employ; While fields and floods, rocks hills and plains, Repeat the sounding joy. III No more let sins and sorrows grow, Nor thorns infest the ground; He comes to make his blessings flow Far as the curse is found. IV He rules the world with truth and grace, And makes the nations prove The glories of his righteousness, And wonders of his love. PSALM 99. First Part. (S. M.) Christ's Kingdom and Majesty. I The God Jehovah reigns, Let all the nations fear, Let sinners tremble at his throne, And saints be humble there. II Jesus the Saviour reigns, Let earth adore its Lord; Bright cherubs his attendants stand, Swift to fulfil his word. III In Zion is his throne, His honours are divine; His church shall make his wonders known, For there his glories shine. IV How holy is his name! How terrible his praise! Justice, and truth, and judgment join In all his works of grace. As the three foregoing psalms refer to the incarnation of Christ, and the setting up his kingdom among the gentiles, because the nations are required to rejoice in all of them; so this psalm seems chiefly to pay honour and reverence to God, as the God of the Jews, God dwelling in the ark between the cherubims; for the people, or gentiles, are bid to tremble: Yet I have ventured to transfer the scene a little down to christian times and churches, and I hope without offence. PSALM 99. Second Part. (L. M.) A Holy God worshipped with Reverence. I Exalt the Lord our God, And worship at his feet; His nature is all holiness, And mercy is his seat. II When Israel was his church, When Aaron was his priest, When Moses cry'd, when Samuel pray'd, He gave his people rest. III Oft he forgave their sins, Nor would destroy their race; And oft he made his vengeance known, When they abus'd his grace. IV Exalt the Lord our God, Whose grace is still the same; Still he's a God of holiness, And jealous for his name. PSALM 100. First Metre. A plain Translation. Praise to our Creator. I Ye nations round the earth, rejoice Before the Lord, your sovereign King; Serve him with cheerful heart and voice, With all your tongues his glory sing. II The Lord is God; 'tis he alone Doth life, and breath, and being give: We are his work, and not our own, The sheep that on his pastures live. III Enter his gates with songs of joy, With praises to his courts repair, And make it your divine employ To pay your thanks and honours there. IV The Lord is good, the Lord is kind; Great is his grace, his mercy sure; And the whole race of man shall find His truth from age to age endure. PSALM 100. Second Metre. A Pharaphrase. I Sing to the Lord with joyful voice; Let every land his name adore; The British isles shall send the noise Across the ocean to the shore. II Nations, attend before his throne With solemn fear, with sacred joy; Know that the Lord is God alone; He can create, and he destroy. III His sovereign power, without our aid, Made us of clay, and form'd us men; And when like wandering sheep we stray'd, He brought us to his fold again. IV We are his people, we his care, Our souls and all our mortal frame: What lasting honours shall we rear, Almighty Maker, to thy name? V We'll crowd thy gates with thankful songs, High as the heavens our voices raise; And earth with her ten thousand tongues Shall fill thy courts with sounding praise. VI Wide as the world is thy command, Vast as eternity thy love; Firm as a rock thy truth must stand When rolling years shall cease to move. PSALM 101. (L. M.) The Magistrate's Psalm. I Mercy and judgment are my song; And since they both to thee belong, My gracious God, my righteous king, To thee my songs and vows I bring. II If I am rais'd to bear the sword, I'll take my counsels from thy word; Thy justice and thy heavenly grace Shall be the pattern of my ways. III Let wisdom all my actions guide, And let my God with me reside; No wicked thing shall dwell with me, Which may provoke thy jealousy. IV No sons of slander, rage and strife Shall be companions of my life; The haughty look, the heart of pride Within my doors shall near abide. V I'll search the land, and raise the just To posts of honour, wealth, and trust: The men that work thy holy will Shall be my friends and favourites still. VI In vain shall sinners hope to rise By flattering or malicious lies; And while the innocent I guard, The bold offender shan't be spar'd. VII The impious crew (that factious band) Shall hide their heads, or quit the land; And all that break the public rest, Where I have power, shall be supprest. The first stanza represents the mercy and judgment which the Psalmist sings, as the due qualities of good government, which is the proper sense of them in this psalm; and according to the double character of David in this psalm, I have applied the first metre to magistrates, the second to householders. The fifth stanza can be sung only by the superior rank of magistrates, and not the inferior. PSALM 101. (C. M.) A Psalm for a Master of a Family. I Of justice and of grace I sing, And pay my God my vows; Thy grace and justice, heavenly King, Teach me to rule my house. II Now to my tent, O God, repair, And make thy servant wise; I'll suffer nothing near me there That shall offend thine eyes. III The man that doth his neighbour wrong, By falsehood or by force, The scornful eye, the slanderous tongue, I'll thrust them from my doors. IV I'll seek the faithful and the just And will their help enjoy; These are the friends that I shall trust, The servants I'll employ. V The wretch that deals in sly deceit, I'll not endure a night: The liar's tongue I ever hate, And banish from my sight. VI I'll purge my family around, And make the wicked flee; So shall my house be ever found A dwelling fit for thee. PSALM 102. v. 1–13, 20, 21. First Part. (C. M.) A Prayer of the Afflicted. I Hear me, O God, nor hide thy face, But answer lest I die; Hast thou not built a throne of grace To hear when sinners cry? II My days are wasted like the smoke Dissolving in the air; My strength is dry'd, my heart is broke, And sinking in despair. III My spirits flag like withering grass Burnt with excessive heat; In secret groans my minutes pass, And I forget to eat. IV As on some lonely building's top The sparrow tells her moan, Far from the tents of joy and hope I sit and grieve alone. V My soul is like a wilderness, Where beasts of midnight howl; There the sad raven finds her place, And there the screaming owl. VI Dark dismal thoughts and boding fears Dwell in my troubled breast; While sharp reproaches wound my ears, Nor give my spirit rest. VII My cup is mingled with my woes, And tears are my repast; My daily bread like ashes grows Unpleasant to my taste. VIII Sense can afford no real joy To souls that feel thy frown; Lord, 'twas thy hand advanc'd me high, Thy hand hath cast me down. IX My looks like wither'd leaves appear, And life's declining light Grows faint as evening shadows are That vanish into night. X But thou for ever art the same, O my eternal God: Ages to come shall know thy name, And spread thy works abroad. XI Thou wilt arise and shew thy face, Nor will my Lord delay Beyond the appointed hour of grace, That long expected day. XII He hears his saints, he knows their cry, And by mysterious ways Redeems the prisoners doom'd to die, And fills their tongues with praise. PSALM 102. v. 13–21. Second Part. (C. M.) Prayer heard, and Zion restored. I Let Zion and her sons rejoice, Behold the promis'd hour; Her God hath heard her mourning voice, And comes t'exalt his power. II Her dust and ruins that remain Are precious in our eyes; Those ruins shall be built again, And all that dust shall rise. III The Lord will raise Jerusalem, And stand in glory there; Nations shall bow before his name, And kings attend with fear. IV He sits a sovereign on his throne, With pity in his eyes; He hears the dying prisoners groan, And sees their sighs arise. V He frees the souls condemn'd to death, And when his saints complain, It shan't be said, ‘That praying breath ‘Was ever spent in vain.’ VI This shall be known when we are dead, And left on long record, That ages yet unborn may read, And trust, and praise the Lord. PSALM 102. v. 23–28. Third Part. (L. M.) Man's Mortality and Christ's Eternity; or, Saints die, but Christ and the Church live. I It is the Lord our Saviour's hand Weakens our strength amidst the race; Disease and death at his command Arrest us, and cut short our days. II Spare us, O Lord, aloud we pray, Nor let our sun go down at noon: Thy years are one eternal day, And must thy children die so soon? III Yet in the midst of death and grief This thought our sorrow shall assuage, ‘Our Father and our Saviour live; ‘Christ is the same thro' every age.’ IV 'Twas he this earth's foundations laid; Heaven is the building of his hand: This earth grows old, these heavens shall fade, And all be chang'd at his command. V The starry curtains of the sky Like garments shall be laid aside; But still thy throne stands firm on high; Thy church for ever must abide. VI Before thy face thy church shall live, And on thy throne thy children reign; This dying world shall they survive And the dead saints be rais'd again. Several verses at the end of this psalm, are directly expounded concerning Christ, Heb. i. which inclined me to form a distinct hymn on those verses, applied to the same subject. PSALM 103. v. 1–7. First Part. (L. M.) Blessing God for his Goodness to Soul and Body. I Bless, O my soul, the living God, Call home thy thoughts that rove abroad, Let all the powers within me join In work and worship so divine. II Bless, O my soul, the God of grace; His favours claim thy highest praise; Why should the wonders he hath wrought Be lost in silence and forgot? III 'Tis he, my soul, that sent his Son To die for crimes which thou hast done; He owns the ransom; and forgives The hourly follies of our lives. IV The vices of the mind he heals, And cures the pains that nature feels; Redeems the soul from hell, and saves Our wasting life from threat'ning graves. V Our youth decay'd his power repairs; His mercy crowns our growing years; He satisfies our mouth with good, And fills our hopes with heavenly food. VI He sees th'oppressor and th'opprest, And often gives the sufferers rest; But will his justice more display In the last great rewarding day. VII His power he shew'd by Moses' hands And gave to Israel his commands; But sent his truth and mercy down To all the nations by his Son. VIII Let the whole earth his power confess, Let the whole earth adore his grace; The Gentile with the Jew shall join In work and worship so divine. PSALM 103. v. 8–18. Second Part. (L. M.) God's gentle Chastisement; or, his tender Mercy to his People. I The Lord, how wondrous are his ways! How firm his truth! how large his grace! He takes his mercy for his throne, And thence he makes his glories known. II Not half so high his power hath spread The starry heavens above our head, As his rich love exceeds our praise, Exceeds the highest hopes we raise. III Not half so far hath nature plac'd The rising morning from the west, As his forgiving grace removes The daily guilt of those he loves. IV How slowly doth his wrath arise! On swifter wings salvation flies; And if he lets his anger burn, How soon his frowns to pity turn! V Amidst his wrath compassion shines; His strokes are lighter than our sins; And while his rod corrects his saints, His ear indulges their complaints. VI So fathers their young sons chastise, With gentle hand and melting eyes; The children weep beneath the smart, And move the pity of their heart. VII The mighty God, the wise, and just, Knows that our frame is feeble dust; And will no heavy loads impose Beyond the strength that he bestows. VIII He knows how soon our nature dies, Blasted by every wind that flies; Like grass we spring and die as soon, Or morning flowers that fade at noon. IX But his eternal love is sure To all the saints, and shall endure: From age to age his truth shall reign, Nor children's children hope in vain. PSALM 103. v. 1–7. First Part. (S. M.) Praise for spiritual and temporal Mercies. I O bless the Lord, my soul; Let all within me join, And aid my tongue to bless his name, Whose favours are divine. II O bless the Lord, my soul; Nor let his mercies lie Forgotten in unthankfulness, And without praises die. III 'Tis he forgives thy sins, 'Tis he relieves thy pain, 'Tis he that heals thy sicknesses, And makes thee young again. IV He crowns thy life with love, When ransom'd from the grave; He that redeem'd my soul from hell Hath sovereign power to save. V He fills the poor with good; He gives the sufferers rest; The Lord hath judgments for the proud, And justice for th'opprest. VI His wondrous works and ways He made by Moses known; But sent the world his truth and grace, By his beloved Son. PSALM 103. v. 8–18. Second Part. (S. M.) Abounding Compassion of God; or, Mercy in the midst of Judgment. I My soul repeat his praise Whose mercies are so great; Whose anger is so slow to rise, So ready to abate. II God will not always chide; And when his strokes are felt, His strokes are fewer than our crimes, And lighter than our guilt. III High as the heavens are rais'd Above the ground we tread, So far the riches of his grace Our highest thoughts exceed. IV His power subdues our sins, And his forgiving love, Far as the east is from the west, Doth all our guilt remove. V The pity of the Lord To those that fear his name Is such as tender parents feel; He knows our feeble frame. VI He knows we are but dust, Scatter'd with every breath; His anger like a rising wind, Can send us swift to death. VII Our days are as the grass, Or like the morning flower; If one sharp blast sweep o'er the field, It withers in an hour. VIII But thy compassions, Lord, To endless years endure; And children's children ever find Thy words of promise sure. PSALM 103. v. 19–22. Third Part. (S. M.) God's universal Dominion; or, Angels praise the Lord. I The Lord the sovereign King, Hath fix'd his throne on high; O'er all the heavenly world he rules, And all beneath the sky. II Ye angels, great in might, And swift to do his will, Bless ye the Lord, whose voice ye hear, Whose pleasure ye fulfil. III Let the bright hosts who wait The orders of their King, And guard his churches when they pray, Join in the praise they sing. IV While all his wondrous works, Thro' his vast kingdom shew Their Maker's glory, thou, my soul, Shalt sing his graces too. PSALM 104. (L. M.) The glory of God in Creation and Providence. I My soul, thy great Creator praise: When cloth'd in his celestial rays He in full majesty appears, And, like a robe, his glory wears.Note, This psalm may be sung to the tune of the old 112th or 127th psalm, by adding these two lines to every stanza, namely, Great is the Lord; what tongue can frame An equal honour to his name? Otherwise it must be sung as the 100th psalm. II The heavens are for his curtains spread, Th'unfathom'd deep he makes his bed; Clouds are his chariot, when he flies On winged storms across the skies. III Angels, whom his own breath inspires, His ministers, are flaming fires; And swift as thought their armies move To bear his vengeance or his love. IV The world's foundations by his hand Are pois'd, and shall for ever stand; He binds the ocean in his chain, Lest it should drown the earth again. V When earth was covered with the flood, Though I am persuaded the psalmist speaks here of the first formation of the sea and mountains, when the waters of the chaos were separated from the earth, yet the people more easily understand it of Noah's flood; and therefore I have indulged such a paraphrase as is capable of both senses. Which high above the mountains stood, He thunder'd; and the ocean fled, Confin'd to its appointed bed. VI The swelling billows know their bound, And in their channels walk their round; Yet thence convey'd by secret veins, They spring on hills and drench the plains. VII He bids the crystal fountains flow, And cheer the vallies as they go; Tame heifers there their thirst allay, And for the stream wild asses bray. VIII From pleasant trees which shade the brink, The lark and linnet light to drink; Their songs the lark and linnet raise, And chide our silence in his praise. IX God, from his cloudy cistern, pours On the parch'd earth enriching showers; The grove, the garden, and the field A thousand joyful blessings yield. X He makes the grassy food arise, And gives the cattle large supplies; With herbs for man, of various power, To nourish nature, or to cure. XI What noble fruit the vines produce! The olive yields a shining juice; Our hearts are cheer'd with gen'rous wine, With inward joy our faces shine. XII O bless his name, ye Britons, fed With nature's chief supporter, bread; While bread your vital strength imparts, Serve him with vigour in your hearts. XIII Behold the stately cedar stands, Rais'd in the forest by his hands; Birds to the boughs for shelter fly, And build their nests secure on high. XIV To craggy hills ascends the goat, And at the airy mountain's foot The feebler creatures make their cell; He gives them wisdom where to dwell. XV He sets the sun his circling race, Appoints the moon to change her face; And when thick darkness veils the day, Calls out wild beasts to hunt their prey. XVI Fierce lions lead their young abroad, And roaring ask their meat from God; But when the morning beams arise, The savage beast to covert flies. XVII Then man to daily labour goes; The night was made for his repose: Sleep is thy gift; that sweet relief From tiresome toil and wasting grief. XVIII How strange thy works! how great thy skill! And every land thy riches fill: Thy wisdom round the world we see, This spacious earth is full of thee. XIX Nor less thy glories in the deep, Where fish in millions swim and creep, With wondrous motions, swift or slow, Still wandering in the paths below. XX There ships divide their watery way, And flocks of scaly monsters play; There dwells the huge Leviathan, And foams and sports in spite of man. XXI Vast are thy works, almighty Lord, All nature rests upon thy word, And the whole race of creatures stands, Waiting their portion from thy hands. XXII While each receives his different food, Their cheerful looks pronounce it good; Eagles and bears, and whales and worms, Rejoice and praise in different forms. XXIII But when thy face is hid they mourn, And dying to their dust return; Both man and beast their souls resign, Life, breath and spirit, all is thine. XXIV Yet thou canst breathe on dust again, And fill the world with beasts and men; A word of thy creating breath Repairs the wastes of time and death. XXV His works, the wonders of his might, Are honour'd with his own delight: How awful are his glorious ways! The Lord is dreadful in his praise. XXVI The earth stands trembling at thy stroke, And at thy touch the mountains smoke; Yet humble souls may see thy face, And tell their wants to sovereign grace. XXVII In thee my hopes and wishes meet, And make my meditations sweet: Thy praises shall my breath employ, Till it expire in endless joy. XXVIII While haughty sinners die accurst, Their glory bury'd with their dust, I, to my God, my heavenly King, Immortal hallelujahs sing. Several lines in this psalm I have borrowed of Sir John Denham, if I have made the connexion more evident, and the sense more easy and useful to an ordinary reader, I have attained my end; and leave others to judge whether I have dishonoured his verse or improved it. PSALM 105. Abridged. (C. M.) God's Conduct of Israel, and Plagues of Egypt. I Give thanks to God, invoke his name, And tell the world his grace; Sound thro' the earth his deeds of fame, That all may seek his face. II His covenant, which he kept in mind For numerous ages past, To numerous ages yet behind In equal force shall last. III He sware to Abraham and his seed, And made the blessing sure: Gentiles the ancient promise read, And find his truth endure. IV ‘Thy seed shall make all nations blest,’ (Said the Almighty voice) ‘And Canaan's land shall be their rest, ‘The type of heavenly joys.’ V How large the grant! how rich the grace! To give them Canaan's land, When they were strangers in the place, A little feeble band! VI Like pilgrims thro' the countries round Securely they remov'd; And haughty kings, that on them frown'd, Severely he reprov'd. VII ‘Touch mine anointed, and my arm ‘Shall soon revenge the wrong; ‘The man that does my prophets harm ‘Shall know their God is strong.’ VIII Then let the world forbear its rage, Nor put the church in fear; Israel must live thro' every age, And be th'Almighty's care. IX When Pharaoh dar'd to vex the saints, And thus provok'd their God, Moses was sent at their complaints, Arm'd with his dreadful rod. X He call'd for darkness; darkness came Like an o'erwhelming flood; He turn'd each lake and every stream To lakes and streams of blood. XI He gave the sign, and noisome flies Thro' the whole country spread; And frogs, in croaking armies, rise About the monarch's bed. XII Thro' fields, and towns, and palaces, The ten-fold vengeance flew; Locusts in swarms devour'd their trees, And hail their cattle slew. XIII Then by an angel's midnight stroke, The flower of Egypt dy'd; The strength of every house was broke, Their glory and their pride. XIV Now let the world forbear its rage, Nor put the church in fear; Israel must live thro' every age, And be th'Almighty's care. XV Thus were the tribes from bondage brought, And left the hated ground; Each some Egyptian spoils had got, And not one feeble found. XVI The Lord himself chose out their way, And mark'd their journies right, Gave them a leading cloud by day, A fiery guide by night. XVII They thirst; and waters from the rock In rich abundance flow, And following still the course they took, Ran all the desert thro'. XVIII O wondrous stream! O blessed type Of ever-flowing grace! So Christ our rock maintains our life Thro' all this wilderness. XIX Thus guarded by th'Almighty hand The chosen tribes possest Canaan the rich, the promis'd land, And there enjoy'd their rest. XX Then let the world forbear its rage, The church renounce her fear; Israel must live thro' every age, And be the Almighty's care. PSALM 106. v. 1–5. First Part. (L. M.) Praise to God; or, Communion with Saints. I To God the great, the ever blest, Let songs of honour be addrest: His mercy firm forever stands; Give him the thanks his love demands. II Who knows the wonders of thy ways? Who shall fulfil thy boundless praise? Blest are the souls that fear thee still, And pay their duty to thy will. III Remember what thy mercy did For Jacob's race, thy chosen seed; And with the same salvation bless The meanest suppliant of thy grace. IV O may I see thy tribes rejoice, And aid their triumphs with my voice! This is my glory, Lord, to be Join'd to thy saints, and near to thee. PSALM 106. v. 7, 8, 12–14, 43–48. Second Part. (S. M.) Israel punished and pardoned; or, God's unchangeable Love. I God of eternal love, How fickle are our ways! And yet how oft did Israel prove Thy constancy of grace! II They saw thy wonders wrought, And then thy praise they sung; But soon thy works of power forgot, And murmur'd with their tongue. III Now they believe his word, While rocks with rivers flow; Now with their lusts provoke the Lord, And he reduc'd them low. IV Yet when they mourn'd their faults, He hearken'd to their groans, Brought his own covenant to his thoughts, And call'd them still his sons. V Their names were in his book, He sav'd them from their foes; Oft he chastis'd but ne'er forsook The people that he chose. VI Let Israel bless the Lord, Who lov'd their ancient race; And christians join the solemn word Amen, to all the praise. The chief design of this whole psalm I have expressed in the title, and abridged it in this form, having enlarged much more on this same subject in the lxxviith, lxxviiith, and cvth psalms. Though the Jews now seem to be cast off, yet the Apostle Paul assures us, that God hath not cast away his people whom he foreknew, Rom. xi. 2. Their unbelief and absence from God is but for a season; for they shall be recalled again, verse 25, 26. PSALM 107. First Part. (L. M.) Israel led to Canaan, and Christians to Heaven. I Give thanks to God; he reigns above Kind are his thoughts, his name is love; His mercy ages past have known, And ages long to come shall own. II Let the redeemed of the Lord The wonders of his grace record; Israel, the nation whom he chose, And rescu'd from their mighty foes. III When God's almighty arm had broke There fetters and the Egyptian yoke, They trac'd the desert wandering round, A wild and solitary ground. IV There they could find no leading road, Nor city for a fix'd abode; Nor food, nor fountain to assuage Their burning thirst, or hunger's rage. V In their distress to God they cry'd God was their Saviour and their guide; He led their march far wandering round, 'Twas the right path to Canaan's ground. VI Thus when our first release we gain From sin's old yoke and Satan's chain, We have this desert world to pass, A dangerous and a tiresome place. VII He feeds and clothes us all the way, He guides our footsteps lest we stray, He guards us with a powerful hand, And brings us to the heavenly land. VIII O let the saints with joy record The truth and goodness of the Lord! How great his works! how kind his ways! Let every tongue pronounce his praise. PSALM 107. Second Part. (L. M.) Correction for Sin, and Release by Prayer. I From age to age exalt his name, God and his grace are still the same; He fills the hungry souls with food, And feeds the poor with every good. II But if their hearts rebel and rise Against the God that rules the skies, If they reject his heavenly word, And slight the counsels of the Lord; III He'll bring their spirits to the ground, And no deliverer shall be found; Laden with grief they waste their breath In darkness and the shades of death. IV Then to the Lord they raise their cries, He makes the dawning light arise, And scatters all that dismal shade, That hung so heavy round their head. V He cuts the bars of brass in two, And lets the smiling prisoners thro' Takes off the load of guilt and grief, And gives the labouring soul relief. VI O may the sons of men record The wondrous goodness of the Lord; How great his works! how kind his ways! Let every tongue pronounce his praise. PSALM 107. Third Part. (L. M.) Intemperance punished and pardoned; or, a Psalm for the Glutton and the Drunkard. I Vain man, on foolish pleasures bent, Prepares for his own punishment; What pains, what loathsome maladies From luxury and lust arise! II The drunkard feels his vitals waste, Yet drowns his health to please his taste; Till all his active powers are lost, And fainting life draws near the dust. III The glutton groans, and loathes to eat, His soul abhors delicious meat; Nature, with heavy loads opprest, Would yield to death to be releas'd. IV Then how the frighted sinners fly To God for help with earnest cry! He hears their groans, prolongs their breath, And saves them from approaching death. V No med'cines could effect the cure So quick, so easy, or so sure: The deadly sentence God repeals, He sends his sovereign word, and heals. VI O may the sons of men record The wondrous goodness of the Lord! And let their thankful offerings prove How they adore their Maker's love. PSALM 107. Fourth Part. (L. M.) Deliverance from Storms and Shipwreck; or the Seaman's Song. I Would you behold the works of God, His wonders in the world abroad, Go with the mariners, and trace The unknown regions of the seas. II They leave their native shores behind, And seize the favour of the wind, Till God command, and tempests rise That heave the ocean to the skies. III Now to the heavens they mount amain, Now sink to dreadful deeps again; What strange affrights young sailors feel, And like a staggering drunkard reel! IV When land is far, and death is nigh, Lost to all hope, to God they cry; His mercy hears the loud address, And sends salvation in distress. V He bids the winds their wrath assuage, The furious waves forget their rage; 'Tis calm; and sailors smile to see The haven where they wish'd to be. VI O may the sons of men record The wondrous goodness of the Lord! Let them their private offerings bring, And in the church his glory sing. PSALM 107. Fourth Part. (C. M.) The Mariner's Psalm. I Thy works of glory, mighty Lord, Thy wonders in the deeps, The sons of courage shall record Who trade in floating ships. II At thy command the winds arise, And swell the tow'ring waves; The men astonish'd mount the skies, And sink in gaping graves. III Again they climb the watery hills, And plunge in deeps again; Each like a tottering drunkard reels, And finds his courage vain. IV Frighted to hear the tempest roar, They pant with fluttering breath, And, hopeless of the distant shore, Expect immediate death. V Then to the Lord they raise their cries, He hears the loud request, And orders silence thro' the skies, And lays the floods to rest. VI Sailors rejoice to lose their fears, And see the storm allay'd: Now to their eyes the port appears; There let their vows be paid. VII 'Tis God that brings them safe to land; Let stupid mortals know That waves are under his command, And all the winds that blow. VIII O that the sons of men would praise The goodness of the Lord! And those that see thy wondrous ways, Thy wondrous love record. PSALM 107. Last Part. (L. M.) Colonies planted; or, Nations blest and punished. A Psalm for New England. I When God, provok'd with daring crimes, Scourges the madness of the times, He turns their fields to barren sand, And dries the rivers from the land. II His word can raise the springs again, And make the wither'd mountains green, Send showery blessings from the skies, And harvests in the desert rise. III Where nothing dwelt but beasts of prey, Or men as fierce and wild as they, He bids th'opprest and poor repair, And builds them towns and cities there. IV They sow the fields, and trees they plant, Whose yearly fruit supplies their want: Their race grows up from fruitful stocks, Their wealth increases with their flocks. V Thus they are blest; but if they sin, He lets the heathen nations in, A savage crew invades their lands, Their princes die by barbarous hands. VI Their captive sons, expos'd to scorn, Wander unpity'd and forlorn; The country lies unfenc'd, untill'd, And desolation spreads the field. VII Yet if the humbled nation mourns, Again his dreadful hand he turns; Again he makes their cities thrive, And bids the dying churches live. VIII The righteous, with a joyful sense, Admire the works of providence; And tongues of atheists shall no more Blaspheme the God that saints adore. IX How few, with pious care, record These wondrous dealings of the Lord! But wise observers still shall find The Lord is holy, just, and kind. If this hymn be too long to sing at once, the two first and two last stanzas of it may be sung together, and the five middle stanzas by themselves, as another hymn; for I could not find any other convenient division of it. The cviiith psalm is formed out of the lviith and lxth; therefore I have omitted it. PSALM 109. v. 1–5, 31. (C. M.) Love to Enemies, from the Example of Christ. I God of my mercy and my praise, Thy glory is my song; Tho' sinners' speak against thy grace With a blaspheming tongue. II When in the form of mortal man Thy Son on earth was found, With cruel slanders, false and vain, They compass'd him around. III Their miseries his compassion move, Their peace he still pursu'd; They render hatred for his love, And evil for his good. IV Their malice rag'd without a cause, Yet, with his dying breath, He pray'd for murderers on his cross, And bless'd his foes in death. V Lord, shall thy bright example shine In vain before my eyes? Give me a soul a-kin to thine To love my enemies. VI The Lord shall on my side engage, And, in my Saviour's name, I shall defeat their pride and rage Who slander and condemn. That this psalm foretels the sufferings, the patience, and love of Christ to enemies, is universally agreed; but the curses on Judas and the priest, &amp;c. I have chosen to leave where they stand in the sacred language of prophesy. PSALM 110. First Part. (L. M.) Christ exalted, and Multitudes converted; or, the Success of the Gospel. I Thus the eternal Father spake To Christ the Son, ‘Ascend and sit ‘At my right hand, till I shall make ‘Thy foes submissive at thy feet. II ‘From Zion shall thy word proceed, ‘Thy word, the sceptre in thy hand, ‘Shall make the hearts of rebels bleed, ‘And bow their wills to thy command. III ‘That day shall shew thy power is great, It is generally supposed the third verse of this psalm describes the numerous conversions that followed the ascension of Christ. The beauty of holiness is but a periphrasis for the temple. That the whole psalm is a prophecy of Christ in his kingdom and priesthood, is abundantly evident from Matt. xxii. 44. Heb. vii. &amp;c. ‘When saints shall flock with willing minds, ‘And sinners crowd thy temple-gate, ‘Where holiness in beauty shines.’ IV O blessed power! O glorious day! It is generally supposed the third verse of this psalm describes the numerous conversions that followed the ascension of Christ. The beauty of holiness is but a periphrasis for the temple. That the whole psalm is a prophecy of Christ in his kingdom and priesthood, is abundantly evident from Matt. xxii. 44. Heb. vii. &amp;c. What a large victory shall ensue! And converts, who thy grace obey, Exceed the drops of morning dew. PSALM 110. Second Part. (L. M.) The Kingdom and Priesthood of Christ. I Thus the great Lord of earth and sea Spake to his Son, and thus he swore; ‘Eternal shall thy priesthood be, ‘And change from hand to hand no more. II ‘Aaron and all his sons must die; ‘But everlasting life is thine, ‘To save for ever those that fly ‘For refuge from the wrath divine. III ‘By me Melchisedek was made ‘On earth a king and priest at once; ‘And thou, my heavenly priest shalt plead, ‘And thou, my King, shalt rule my sons.’ IV Jesus the priest ascends his throne, Zech. vi. 13. He shall be a priest upon his throne, and the counsel of peace shall be between them both. The last verse of this psalm is explained by interpreters in very contrary senses. Some make his drinking of the brook to signify mean refreshments in his way, and some expound it of his tasting sorrows and sufferings; the last is most evangelical and most beautiful, therefore I have chosen it. While counsels of eternal peace, Between the Father and the Son, Proceed with honour and success. V Thro' the whole earth his reign shall spread, And crush the powers that dare rebel; Then shall he judge the rising dead, And send the guilty world to hell. VI Tho' while he treads his glorious way, He drink the cup of tears and blood, The sufferings of that dreadful day Shall but advance him near to God. The priesthood of Christ, after the order of Melchisedek, is particularly explained, Heb. vii. 1, 3, 23–25. and is inserted in the three first stanzas. PSALM 110. (C. M.) Christ's Kingdom and Priesthood. I Jesus, our Lord, ascend thy throne, And near the Father sit; In Zion shall thy power be known, And make thy foes submit. II What wonders shall thy gospel do! Thy converts shall surpass The numerous drops of morning dew, And own thy sovereign grace. III God hath pronounc'd a firm decree, Nor changes what he swore; ‘Eternal shall thy priesthood be, ‘When Aaron is no more. IV ‘Melchisedek, that wondrous priest, ‘That king of high degree, ‘That holy man who Abr'am blest, ‘Was but a type of thee.’ V Jesus our priest for ever lives To plead for us above; Jesus our King for ever gives The blessings of his love. VI God shall exalt his glorious head, And his high throne maintain, Shall strike the powers and princes dead Who dare oppose his reign. PSALM 111. First Part. (C. M.) The Wisdom of God in his Works. I Songs of immortal praise belong To my almighty God; He has my heart, and he my tongue To spread his name abroad. II How great the works his hand has wrought! How glorious in our sight! And men in every age have sought His wonders with delight. III How most exact is nature's frame! How wise th'Eternal Mind! His counsels never change the scheme That his first thoughts design'd. VI When he redeem'd his chosen sons, He fix'd his covenant sure: The orders that his lips pronounce To endless years endure. V Nature and time, and earth and skies, Thy heavenly skill proclaim: What shall we do to make us wise, But learn to read thy name? VI To fear thy power, to trust thy grace Is our divinest skill; And he's the wisest of our race That best obeys thy will. Of this psalm I have chosen several verses, and formed into two distinct hymns, keeping the first and the two last verses in both. PSALM 111. Second Part. (C. M.) The Perfections of God. I Great is the Lord; his works of might Demand our noblest songs; Let his assembled saints unite Their harmony of tongues. II Great is the mercy of the Lord, He gives his children food; And ever mindful of his word, He makes his promise good. III His Son, the great Redeemer, came To seal his covenant sure: Holy and reverend is his name, His ways are just and pure. IV They that would grow divinely wise Must with his fear begin; Our fairest proof of knowledge lies In hating every sin. PSALM 112. As the 113th Psalm. The Blessings of the liberal Man. I That man is blest who stands in awe Of God, and loves his sacred law: His seed on earth shall be renown'd; His house the seat of wealth shall be, An inexhausted treasury, And with successive honours crown'd. II His liberal favours he extends, To some he gives, to others lends; A generous pity fills his mind: Yet what his charity impairs, He saves by prudence in affairs, And thus he's just to all mankind. III His hands, while they his alms bestow'd, His glory's future harvest sow'd; The sweet remembrance of the just. Like a green root, revives and bears A train of blessings for his heirs, When dying nature sleeps in dust. IV Beset with threatening dangers round, Unmov'd shall he maintain his ground; His conscience holds his courage up: The soul that's fill'd with virtue's light Shines brightest in affliction's night, And sees in darkness beams of hope. V Ill tidings never can surprise His heart that fix'd on God relies, Tho' waves and tempests roar around: Safe on the rock he sits, and sees The shipwreck of his enemies, And all their hope and glory drown'd. VI The wicked shall his triumph see, And gnash their teeth in agony To find their expectations crost: They and their envy, pride and spite, Sink down to everlasting night, And all their names in darkness lost. Many lines of this metre, and some of the next psalm, proper metre, are borrowed from Mr. Tate's version. PSALM 112. (L. M.) The Blessings of the Pious and Charitable. I Thrice happy man who fears the Lord, Loves his commands, and trusts his word; Honour and peace his days attend, And blessings to his seed descend. II Compassion dwells upon his mind, To works of mercy still inclin'd: He lends the poor some present aid, Or gives them, not to be repaid. III When times grow dark, and tidings spread That fill his neighbours round with dread, His heart is arm'd against the fear, For God with all his power is there. IV His soul, well fix'd upon the Lord, Draws heavenly courage from his word: Amidst the darkness light shall rise To cheer his heart, and bless his eyes. V He hath dispers'd his alms abroad, His works are still before his God; His name on earth shall long remain, While envious sinners fret in vain. PSALM 112. (C. M.) Liberality rewarded. I Happy is he that fears the Lord, And follows his commands, Who lends the poor without reward, Or gives with liberal hands. II As pity dwells within his breast To all the sons of need; So God shall answer his request With blessings on his seed. III No evil tidings shall surprise His well-establish'd mind; His soul to God his refuge flies, And leaves his fears behind. IV In times of general distress, Some beams of light shall shine To shew the world his righteousness, And give him peace divine. V His works of piety and love Remain before the Lord; Honour on earth and joys above Shall be his sure reward. Many of the blessings of wealth, and grandeur, and temporal good things, that were the portion of a good man and his children, under the Old Testament, I have here abridged agreeable to the New, which foretels rather temporal afflictions, and promises everlasting reward. PSALM 113. Proper Tune. The Majesty and Condescension of God. I Ye that delight to serve the Lord, The honours of his name record, His sacred name for ever bless: Where'er the circling sun displays His rising beams, or setting rays, Let lands and seas his power confess. II Not time, nor nature's narrow rounds, Can give his vast dominion bounds, The heavens are far below his height: Let no created greatness dare With our eternal God compare, Arm'd with his uncreated might. III He bows his glorious head to view What the bright hosts of angels do, And bends his care to mortal things; His sovereign hand exalts the poor, He takes the needy from the door, And makes them company for kings. IV When childless families despair, He sends the blessing of an heir To rescue their expiring name; The mother with a thankful voice Proclaims his praises and her joys: Let every age advance his fame. PSALM 113. (L. M.) God Sovereign and Gracious. I Ye servants of th'almighty King, In every age his praises sing; Where'er the sun shall rise or set, The nations shall his praise repeat. II Above the earth, beyond the sky, Stands his high throne of majesty: Nor time, nor place, his power restrain, Nor bound his universal reign. III Which of the sons of Adam dare, Or angels, with their God compare? His glories how divinely bright, Who dwells in uncreated light! IV Behold his love: he stoops to view What saints above and angels do; And condescends yet more to know The mean affairs of men below V From dust and cottages obscure, His grace exalts the humble poor; Gives them the honour of his sons, And fits them for their heavenly thrones. VI A word of his creating voice Can make the barren house rejoice: Tho' Sarah's ninety years were past, The promis'd seed is born at last. VII With joy the mother views her son, And tells the wonders God has done: Faith may grow strong when sense despairs, If nature fails, the promise bears. Part of the 6th and 7th stanzas are borrowed from Gen. xvii. 17. and Rom. iv. 19, 20. Shall Sarah that is ninety years old bear? Abraham was strong in faith, &amp;c. PSALM 114. (L. M.) Miracles attending Israel's Journey. I When Israel, freed from Pharaoh's hand, Left the proud tyrant, and his land, The tribes with cheerful homage own Their King, and Judah was his throne. II Across the deep their journey lay; The deep divides to make them way: Jordan beheld their march and fled With backward current to his head. III The mountains shook like frighted sheep, Like lambs the little hillocks leap; Not Sinai on her base could stand, Conscious of sovereign power at hand. IV What power could make the deep divide? Make Jordan backward roll his tide? Why did ye leap, ye little hills? And whence the fright that Sinai feels? V Let every mountain every flood, Retire and know the approaching God, The King of Israel: see him here; Tremble, thou earth, adore and fear. VI He thunders, and all nature mourns, The rock to standing pools he turns; Flints spring with fountains at his word, And fires and seas confess the Lord. This psalm appears to me an admirable ode; but if I had introduced the presence of God into the camp of Israel removing from Egypt, as all my predecessors have done, I had lost the divine beauty of the psalm: For had God appeared at first, there could be no wonder why the mountains should leap, and the sea retire; therefore that this convulsion of nature may be brought in with due surprise, the sacred poet conceals his name till afterward, and then with a very agreeable turn of thought, God is introduced at once in all his majesty. This is what I have attempted to imitate, and to preserve what I could of the spirit of the inspired author. PSALM 115. First Metre. The true God our Refuge; or, Idolatry reproved. I Not to ourselves, who are but dust, Not to ourselves is glory due, Eternal God, thou only just, Thou only gracious, wise and true. II Shine forth in all thy dreadful name; Why should a heathen's haughty tongue Insult us, and to raise our shame Say, ‘where's the God you've serv'd so long?’ III The God we serve maintains his throne Above the clouds, beyond the skies, Thro' all the earth his will is done, He knows our groans, he hears our cries. IV But the vain idols they adore Are senseless shapes of stone and wood; At best a mass of glittering ore, A silver saint, or golden god. V With eyes and ears they carve their head, Deaf are their ears, their eyes are blind; In vain are costly offerings made, And vows are scatter'd in the wind. VI Their feet were never made to move, Nor hands to save when mortals pray; Mortals that pay them fear or love Seem to be blind and deaf as they. VII O Israel, make the Lord thy hope, Thy help, thy refuge, and thy rest; The Lord shall build thy ruins up, And bless the people and the priest. VIII The dead no more can speak thy praise, They dwell in silence and the grave; But we shall live to sing thy grace, And tell the world thy power to save. PSALM 115. Second Metre. As the New Tune of the 50th Psalm. Popish Idolatry reproved. A Psalm for the 5th of November. I Not to our names, thou only just and true, Not to our worthless names is glory due: Thy power and grace, thy truth and justice claim Immortal honours to thy sovereign name: Shine thro' the earth from heaven, thy blest abode, Nor let the heathens say, And where's your God? II Heaven is thine higher court; there stands thy throne, And through the lower worlds thy will is done: Our God fram'd all this earth, these heavens he spread, But fools adore the gods their hands have made: The kneeling crowd, with looks devout behold Their silver-saviours, and their saints of gold. III Vain are those artful shapes of eyes and ears; The molten image neither sees nor hears: Their hands are helpless, nor their feet can move, They have no speech, nor thought, nor power, nor love; Yet sottish mortals make their long complaints To their deaf idols, and their moveless saints. IV The rich have statues well adorn'd with gold; The poor, content with gods of coarser mould, With tools of iron carve the senseless stock, Lopt from a tree, or broken from a rock: People and priest drive on the solemn trade, And trust the gods that saws and hammers made. V Be heaven and earth amaz'd! 'Tis hard to say Which is more stupid, or their gods or they: O Israel, trust the Lord; he hears and sees, He knows thy sorrows, and restores thy peace: His worship does a thousand comforts yield, He is thy help and he thy heavenly shield. VI O Britain, trust the Lord: Thy foes in vain Attempt thy ruin, and oppose his reign; Had they prevail'd darkness had clos'd our days, And death and silence had forbid his praise: But we are sav'd, and live: let songs arise, And Britain bless the God that built the skies. PSALM 116. First Part. (C. M.) Recovery from Sickness. I I love the Lord; he heard my cries, And pity'd every groan: Long as I live, when troubles rise, I'll hasten to his throne. II I love the Lord; he bow'd his ear, And chas'd my griefs away; O let my heart no more despair, While I have breath to pray! III My flesh declin'd, my spirits fell, And I drew near the dead, While inward pangs, and fears of hell Perplex'd my wakeful head. IV ‘My God,’ I cry'd, ‘thy servant save, ‘Thou ever good and just; ‘Thy power can rescue from the grave, ‘Thy power is all my trust.’ V The Lord beheld me sore distrest, He bid my pains remove: Return, my soul, to God thy rest, For thou hast known his love. VI My God hath sav'd my soul from death And dry'd my falling tears; Now to his praise I'll spend my breath, And my remaining years. PSALM 116. v. 12, &amp;c. Second Part. (C. M.) Vows made in Trouble paid in the Church; or, public Thanks for private Deliverance. I What shall I render to my God For all his kindness shown? My feet shall visit thine abode, My songs address thy throne. II Among the saints that fill thine house, My offerings shall be paid; There shall my zeal perform the vows My soul in anguish-made. III How much is mercy thy delight, Thou ever-blessed God! How dear thy servants in thy sight! How precious is their blood! IV How happy all thy servants are! How great thy grace to me! My life which thou hast made thy care, Lord, I devote to thee. V Now I am thine, for ever thine, Nor shall my purpose move; Thy hand hath loos'd my bonds of pain, And bound me with thy love. VI Here in thy courts I leave my vow, And thy rich grace record; Witness, ye saints, who hear me now, If I forsake the Lord. PSALM 117. (C. M.) Praise to God from all Nations. I O all ye nations, praise the Lord, Each with a different tongue; In every language learn his word, And let his name be sung. II His mercy reigns thro' every land; Proclaim his grace abroad; For ever firm his truth shall stand, Praise ye the faithful God. PSALM 117. (L. M.) The same. [From all that dwell below the skies] I From all that dwell below the skies, Let the Creator's praise arise; Let the Redeemer's name be sung Thro' every land, by every tongue. II Eternal are thy mercies, Lord; Eternal truth attends thy word: Thy praise shall sound from shore to shore, Till suns shall rise and set no more. PSALM 117. (S. M.) The same. [Thy name, almighty Lord] I Thy name, almighty Lord, Shall sound thro' distant lands, Great is thy grace, and sure thy word, Thy truth for ever stands. II Far be thine honour spread, And long thy praise endure, Till morning light and evening shade Shall be exchang'd no more. PSALM 118. v. 6–15. First Part. (C. M.) Deliverance from a Tumult. I The Lord appears my helper now, Nor is my faith afraid What all the sons of earth can do, Since heaven affords its aid. II 'Tis safer, Lord, to hope in thee, And have my God my friend, Than trust in men of high degree, And on their truth depend. III Like bees my foes beset me round, A large and angry swarm; But I shall all their rage confound By thine Almighty arm. IV 'Tis thro' the Lord my heart is strong, In him my lips rejoice; While his salvation is my song, How cheerful is my voice! V Like angry bees they girt me round; When God appears they fly: So burning thorns, with crackling sound, Make a fierce blaze and die. VI Joy to the saints and peace belongs; The Lord protects their days: Let Israel tune immortal songs To his almighty grace. PSALM 118. v. 17–21. Second Part. (C. M.) Public Praise for Deliverance from Death. I Lord, thou hast heard thy servant cry, And rescu'd from the grave; Now shall he live: (and none can die If God resolve to save.) II Thy praise more constant than before, Shall fill his daily breath; Thy hand that hath chastis'd him sore, Defends him still from death. III Open the gates of Zion now, For we shall worship there, The house where all the righteous go Thy mercy to declare. IV Among th'assemblies of thy saints Our thankful voice we raise; There we have told thee our complaints, And there we speak thy praise. PSALM 118. v. 22, 23. Third Part. (C. M.) Christ the Foundation of his Church. I Behold the sure foundation-stone Which God in Zion lays To build our heavenly hopes upon, And his eternal praise. II Chosen of God to sinners dear, And saints adore the name, They trust their whole salvation here, Nor shall they suffer shame. III The foolish builders, scribe and priest, Reject it with disdain; Yet on this rock, the church shall rest, And envy rage in vain. IV What tho' the gates of hell withstood, Yet must this building rise: 'Tis thy own work, almighty God, And wondrous in our eyes. These five verses, from the 22nd to the 27th, contain a glorious prophesy of Christ: I have explained them at large in the language of the New Testament, in two distinct hymns: 1 Pet. ii. 4, 6. Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner stone, elect, precious; and he that believeth on him shall not be ashamed—disallowed of men, but chosen of God, and precious, Matt. xvi. 18. Upon this rock will I build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. See the notes on the following hymns. PSALM 118. v. 24–26. Fourth Part. (C. M.) Hosanna; the Lord's Day; or, Christ's Resurrection and our Salvation. I This is the day the Lord hath made, This is the day wherein Christ fulfilled his fufferings, and rose from the dead, and has honoured it with his own name. Rev. i. 10. The Lord's Day. He calls the hours his own; Let heaven rejoice, let earth be glad, And praise surround the throne. II To-day he rose and left the dead, And Satan's empire fell; To-day the saints his triumph spread, And all his wonders tell. III Hosanna to th'anointed King, This verse is explained, Matt. xxi. 9. Hosanna to the Son of David. Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest. The word Hosanna signifies, Save, we beseech. To David's holy Son: Help us, O Lord; descend and bring Salvation from the throne. IV Blest be the Lord, who comes to men With messages of grace; Who comes in God his Father's name To save our sinful race. V Hosanna in the highest strains The church on earth can raise; The highest heavens, in which he reigns, Shall give him nobler praise. See the notes on the foregoing and following hymns. PSALM 118. v. 22–27. (S. M.) An Hosanna for the Lord's Day; or, a new Song of Salvation by Christ. I See what a living stone The builders did refuse; Yet God hath built his church thereon In spite of envious Jews. II The scribe and angry priest Reject thine only Son; Yet on this rock shall Zion rest As the chief corner-stone. III The work, O Lord, is thine, And wondrous in our eyes; This day declares it all divine, This day did Jesus rise. IV This is the glorious day That our Redeemer made; Let us rejoice, and sing, and pray, Let all the church be glad. V Hosanna to the King Of David's royal blood: Bless him, ye saints; he comes to bring Salvation from your God. VI We bless thine holy word, The 27th verse must be explained evangelically; the Gospel is our light, our Altar is Christ, and our Sacrifices are Prayer and Praise: Heb. xiii. 10, 15. Which all this grace displays; And offer on thine altar, Lord, Our sacrifice of praise. PSALM 118. v. 22–27. (L. M.) The same. [Lo! what a glorious corner-stone] I Lo! what a glorious corner-stone The jewish builders did refuse; But God hath built his church thereon, In spite of envy and the Jews. II Great God, the work is all divine, The joy and wonder of our eyes; This is the day that proves it thine, The day that saw our Saviour rise. III Sinners rejoice, and saints be glad: Hosanna signifies save we beseech, as verse 25. And since the Hosanna is ascribed to Christ in Matt. xxi. 9. it seems to mean properly, an acclamation to Christ as King: As we say in our language, God save the King, or God bless the King; though in the common metre, I have turned it as a short prayer for our own salvation, in the sense in which it is often understood. Hosanna, let his name be blest: A thousand honours on his head, With peace, and light, and glory, rest. IV In God's own name he comes to bring Salvation to our dying race: Let the whole church address their King With hearts of joy, and songs of praise. PSALM 119. First Part. (C. M.) The Blessedness of Saints, and Misery of Sinners. I have collected and disposed the most useful verses of this Psalm under eighteen different heads, and formed a Divine Song on each of them; but the verses are much transposed, to attain some degree of connexion. In some places, among the words Law, Commands, Judgments, Testimonies, I have used Gospel, Word, Grace, Truth, Promises, &amp;c. as more agreeble to the New Testament, and the common language of christians; and it equally answers the design of the Psalmist, which was to recommend the Holy Scriptures. Verses 1, 2, 3. I Blest are the undefil'd in heart, Whose ways are right and clean; Who never from thy law depart, But fly from every sin. II Blest are the men that keep thy word, And practise thy commands; With their whole heart they seek the Lord, And serve thee with their hands. 165. III Great is their peace who love thy law; How firm their souls abide! Nor can a bold temptation draw Their steady feet aside. 6. IV Then shall my heart have inward joy, And keep my face from shame, When all thy statutes I obey, And honour all thy name. 21, 118. V But haughty sinners God will hate, The proud shall die accurst; The sons of falsehood and deceit Are trodden to the dust. 119, 155. VI Vile as the dross the wicked are; And those that leave thy ways Shall see salvation from afar, But never taste thy grace. PSALM 119. Second Part. (C. M.) Secret Devotion and Spiritual-mindedness; or, constant Converse with God. I To thee, before the dawning light, My gracious God, I pray; I meditate thy name by night, And keep thy law by day. 147, 55, II My spirit faints to see thy grace, Thy promise bears me up; And while salvation long delays, Thy word supports my hope. 81. III Seven times a day I lift my hands, And pay my thanks to thee; Thy righteous providence demands Repeated praise from me. 164. IV When midnight darkness veils the skies, I call thy works to mind; My thoughts in warm devotion rise, And sweet acceptance find. 62. PSALM 119. Third Part. (C. M.) Professions of Sincerity, Repentance, and Obedience. I Thou art my portion, O my God; Soon as I know thy way, My heart makes haste t'obey thy word, And suffers no delay. 57, 60. II I choose the path of heavenly truth, And glory in my choice: Not all the riches of the earth Could make me so rejoice. 30, 14. III The testimonies of thy grace I set before my eyes; Thence I derive my daily strength, And there my comfort lies. IV If once I wander from thy path, I think upon my ways, Then turn my feet to thy commands, And trust thy pardoning grace. 59. V Now I am thine, for ever thine, O save thy servant, Lord; Thou art my shield, my hiding-place, My hope is in thy word. 94, 114. VI Thou hast inclin'd this heart of mine Thy statutes to fulfil; And thus till mortal life shall end Would I perform thy will. 112. PSALM 119. Fourth Part. (C. M.) Instruction from Scripture. I How shall the young secure their hearts, And guard their lives from sin? Thy word the choicest rules imparts To keep the conscience clean. 9. II When once it enters to the mind, It spreads such light abroad, The meanest souls instruction find, And raise their thoughts to God. 130. III 'Tis like the sun, a heavenly light, That guides us all the day; And thro' the dangers of the night, A lamp to lead our way. 105. IV The men that keep thy law with care, And meditate thy word, Grow wiser than their teachers are, And better know the Lord. 99, 100. V Thy precepts make me truly wise; I hate the sinner's road; I hate my own vain thoughts that rise, But love thy law, my God. 104, 113. VI The starry heavens thy rule obey, The earth maintains her place; And these thy servants night and day Thy skill and power express! 89, 90, 91. VII But still thy law and gospel, Lord, Have lessons more divine; Not earth stands firmer than thy word, Nor stars so nobly shine. VIII Thy word is everlasting truth; How pure is every page! That holy book shall guide our youth, And well support our age. 160, 140, 9, 116. PSALM 119. Fifth Part. (C. M.) Delight in Scripture; or, the Word of God dwelling in us. I O how I love thy holy law! 'Tis daily my delight; And thence my meditations draw Divine advice by night. 97. II My waking eyes prevent the day To meditate thy word; My soul with longing melts away To hear thy gospel, Lord. 148. III How doth thy word my heart engage? How well employ my tongue! And, in my tiresome pilgrimage, Yields me a heavenly song. 3, 13, 54. IV Am I a stranger, or at home, 'Tis my perpetual feast; Not honey dropping from the comb So much allures the taste. 19, 103. V No treasures so enrich the mind; Nor shall thy word be sold For loads of silver well refin'd, Nor heaps of choicest gold. 72, 127. VI When nature sinks, and spirits droop, Thy promises of grace Are pillars to support my hope, And there I write thy praise. 28, 49, 175. PSALM 119. Sixth Part. (C. M.) Holiness and Comfort from the Word. I Lord, I esteem thy judgments right, And all thy statutes just; Thence I maintain a constant fight With every flattering lust. 128. II Thy precepts often I survey; I keep thy law in sight, Thro' all the business of the day, To form my actions right. 97. 9. III My heart in midnight silence cries, ‘How sweet thy comforts be!’ My thoughts in holy wonder rise, And bring their thanks to thee. 62. IV And when my spirit drinks her fill At some good word of thine, Not mighty men that share the spoil Have joys compar'd to mine. 162. PSALM 119. Seventh Part. (C. M.) Imperfections of Nature, and Perfection of Scripture. I Let all the heathen writers join To form one perfect book, Great God, if once compar'd with thine, How mean their writings look! 96. Paraphrased. II Not the most perfect rules they gave Could shew one sin forgiven, Nor lead a step beyond the grave; But thine conduct to heaven. III I've seen an end of what we call Perfection here below; How short the powers of nature fall, And can no farther go! IV Yet men would fain be just with God By works their hands have wrought; But thy commands, exceeding broad, Extend to every thought. V In vain we boast perfection here, While sin defiles our frame, And sinks our virtues down so far, They scarce deserve the name. VI Our faith and love, and every grace, Fall far below thy word; But perfect truth and righteousness Dwell only with the Lord. PSALM 119. Eighth Part. (C. M.) The Word of God is the Saint's Portion; or, the Excellency and Variety of Scripture. I Lord, I have made thy word my choice, My lasting heritage; There shall my noblest powers rejoice, My warmest thoughts engage. 111. Paraphrased. II I'll read the histories of thy love, And keep thy laws in sight, While thro' the promises I rove, With ever-fresh delight. III 'Tis a broad land of wealth unknown Where springs of life arise, Seeds of immortal bliss are sown, And hidden glory lies. IV The best relief that mourners have, It makes our sorrows blest; Our fairest hope beyond the grave, And our eternal rest. PSALM 119. Ninth Part. (C. M.) Desire of Knowledge; or, the Teaching's of the Spirit with the Word. I Thy mercies fill the earth, O Lord, How good thy works appear! Open mine eyes to read thy word, And see thy wonders there. 64, 68, 18. II My heart was fashion'd by thy hand, My service is thy due: O make thy servant understand The duties he must do. 73, 125. III Since I'm a stranger here below, Let not thy path be hid, But mark the road my feet should go, And be my constant guide. 19. IV When I confess'd my wandering ways, Thou heardst my soul complain; Grant me the teachings of thy grace Or I shall stray again. 26. V If God to me his statutes shew, And heavenly truth impart, His work for ever I'll pursue, His law shall rule my heart. 33, 34. VI This was my comfort when I bore Variety of grief; It made me learn thy word the more, And fly to that relief. 50, 71. VII In vain the proud deride me now; I'll ne'er forget thy law, Nor let that blessed gospel go Whence all my hopes I draw. 51. VIII When I have learn'd my Father's will, I'll teach the world his ways; My thankful lips inspir'd with zeal Shall loud pronounce his praise. 27, 171. PSALM 119. Tenth Part. (C. M.) Pleading the Promises. I Behold thy waiting servant, Lord, Devoted to thy fear; Remember and comfirm thy word, For all my hopes are there. 38, 49. I Hast thou not writ salvation down, And promis'd quickening grace? Doth not my heart address thy throne? And yet thy love delays. 41, 58, 107. III Mine eyes for thy salvation fail; O bear thy servant up; Nor let the scoffing lips prevail, Who dare reproach my hope. 123, 42. IV Didst thou not raise my faith, O Lord? Then let thy truth appear: Saints shall rejoice in my reward, And trust as well as fear. 49, 74. PSALM 119. Eleventh Part. (C. M.) Breathing after Holiness. I O that the Lord would guide my ways To keep his statutes still! O that my God would grant me grace To know and do his will! 5, 33. II O send thy Spirit down to write Thy law upon my heart! Nor let my tongue indulge deceit, Nor act the liar's part. 29. III From vanity turn off my eyes: Let no corrupt design, Nor covetous desires arise Within this soul of mine. 37, 36. IV Order my footsteps by thy word, And make my heart sincere; Let sin have no dominion, Lord, But keep my conscience clear. 133. V My soul hath gone too far astray, My feet too often slip; Yet since I've not forgot thy way, Restore thy wandering sheep. 176. VI Make me to walk in thy commands, 'Tis a delightful road; Nor let my head, or heart, or hands, Offend against my God. 35. PSALM 119. Twelfth Part. (C. M.) Breathing after Comfort and Deliverance. I My God, consider my distress, Let mercy plead my cause; Tho' I have sinn'd against thy grace, I can't forget thy laws. 153. II Forbid, forbid the sharp reproach Which I so justly fear; Uphold my life, uphold my hopes, Nor let my shame appear. 39, 116. III Be thou a surety, Lord, for me, Nor let the proud oppress; But make thy waiting servant see The shinings of thy face. 122, 135. IV My eyes with expectation fail, My heart within me cries, ‘When will the Lord his truth fulfil, ‘And make my comforts rise?’ 82. V Look down upon my sorrows, Lord, And shew thy grace the same As thou art ever wont t'afford To those that love thy name. 132. PSALM 119. Thirteenth Part. (C. M.) Holy Fear, and Tenderness of Conscience. I With my whole heart I've sought thy face, O let me never stray From thy commands, O God of grace, Nor tread the sinner's way. 10. II Thy word I've hid within my heart To keep my conscience clean, And be an everlasting guard From every rising sin. 11. III I'm a companion of the saints Who fear and love the Lord; My sorrows rise, my nature faints, When men transgress thy word. 63, 53, 158. VI While sinners do thy gospel wrong, My spirit stands in awe; My soul abhors a lying tongue, But loves thy righteous law. 161, 163. V My heart with sacred reverence hears The threat'nings of thy word: My flesh with holy trembling fears The judgments of the Lord. 161, 120. VI My God, I long, I hope, I wait For thy salvation still; While thy whole law is my delight, And I obey thy will. 166, 174. PSALM 119. Fourteenth Part. (C. M.) Benefit of Afflictions, and Support under them. I Consider all my sorrows, Lord, And thy deliverance send; My soul for thy salvation faints, When will my troubles end? 153, 81, 82. II Yet I have found 'tis good for me To bear my Father's rod; Afflictions make me learn thy law, And live upon my God. 71. III This is the comfort I enjoy When new distress begins, I read thy word, I run thy way, And hate my former sins. 50. IV Had not thy word been my delight When earthly joys were fled, My soul opprest with sorrows weight Had sunk amongst the dead. 92. V I know thy judgments, Lord, are right, Tho' they may seem severe; The sharpest sufferings I endure Flow from thy faithful care. 75. VI Before I knew thy chastening rod My feet were apt to stray; But now I learn to keep thy word, Nor wander from thy way. 67. PSALM 119 Fifteenth Part. (C. M.) Holy Resolutions. I O that thy statutes every hour, Might dwell upon my mind! Thence I derive a quickening power, And daily peace I find. 93. II To meditate thy precepts, Lord, Shall be my sweet employ; My soul shall ne'er forget thy word, Thy word is all my joy. 15, 16. III How would I run in thy commands, If thou my heart discharge From sin and Satan's hateful chains, And set my feet at large! 32. IV My lips with courage shall declare Thy statutes and thy name; I'll speak thy word, tho' kings should hear, Nor yield to sinful shame. 13, 46. V Let bands of persecutors rise To rob me of my right, Let pride and malice forge their lies, Thy law is my delight. 61, 69, 70. VI Depart from me, ye wicked race, Whose hands and hearts are ill; I love my God, I love his ways, And must obey his will. 115. PSALM 119. Sixteenth Part. (C. M.) Prayer for quickening Grace. I My soul lies cleaving to the dust; Lord, give me life divine; From vain desires and every lust Turn off these eyes of mine. 25, 37. II I need the influence of thy grace To speed me in thy way, Lest I should loiter in my race, Or turn my feet astray. III When sore afflictions press me down, I need thy quickening powers; Thy word that I have rested on Shall help my heaviest hours. 107. IV Are not thy mercies sovereign still? And thou a faithful God? Wilt thou not grant me warmer zeal To run the heavenly road? 156, 40. V Does not my heart thy precepts love, And long to see thy face? And yet how slow my spirits move Without enlivening grace! 159, 40. VI Then shall I love thy gospel more, And ne'er forget thy word, When I have felt its quickening power To draw me near the Lord. 93. PSALM 119. Seventeenth Part. (L. M.) Courage and Perseverance under Persecution; or, Grace shining in Difficulties and Trials. I When pain and anguish seize me, Lord, All my support is from thy word: My soul dissolves for heaviness, Uphold me with thy strengthening grace. 143, 28. II The proud have fram'd their scoffs and lies, They watch my feet with envious eyes, And tempt my soul to snares and sin, Yet thy commands I ne'er decline. 51, 69, 110. III They hate me, Lord, without a cause, They hate to see me love thy laws; But I will trust and fear thy name, Till pride and malice die with shame. 161, 78. PSALM 119. Last Part. (L. M.) Sanctified Affliction; or, Delight in the Word of God. I Father, I bless thy gentle hand; How kind was thy chastising rod, That forc'd my conscience to a stand, And brought my wandering soul to God! 67, 59. II Foolish and vain I went astray, Ere I had felt thy scourges, Lord, I left my guide, and lost my way; But now I love and keep thy word. III 'Tis good for me to wear the yoke, For pride is apt to rise and swell; 'Tis good to bear my father's stroke, That I might learn his statutes well. 71. IV The law that issues from thy mouth Shall raise my cheerful passions more Than all the treasures of the south, Or western hills of golden ore. 72. V Thy hands have made my mortal frame, Thy spirit form'd my soul within; Teach me to know thy wondrous name, And guard me safe from death and sin. 73. VI Then all that love and fear the Lord At my salvation shall rejoice; For I have hoped in thy word, And made thy grace my only choice. 74. PSALM 120. (C. M.) Complaint of quarrelsome Neighbours; or, a devout Wish for Peace. I Thou God of love, thou ever-blest, Pity my suffering state; When wilt thou set my soul at rest From lips that love deceit? II Hard lot of mine! my days are cast Among the sons of strife, Whose never-ceasing brawlings waste My golden hours of life. III O might I fly to change my place, How would I choose to dwell In some wide lonesome wilderness, And leave these gates of hell. IV Peace is the blessing that I seek, How lovely are its charms! I am for peace; but when I speak, They all declare for arms. V New passions still their souls engage, And keep their malice strong: What shall be done to curb thy rage, O thou devouring tongue! VI Should burning arrows smite thee thro', Strict justice would approve; But I had rather spare my foe, And melt his heart with love. I hope the transposition of several verses of this psalm is no disadvantage to this imitation of it. Nor will the spirit of the gospel, and charity at the end, render it less agreeable to christian ears. PSALM 121. (L. M.) Divine Protection. I Up to the hills I lift mine eyes, Th'eternal hills beyond the skies; Thence all her help my soul derives; There my almighty refuge lives. II He lives, the everlasting God, That built the world, that spread the flood; The heavens with all their hosts he made, And the dark regions of the dead. III He guides our feet, he guards our way; His morning-smiles bless all the day; He spreads the evening-veil, and keeps The silent hours while Israel sleeps. IV Israel, a name divinely blest, May rise secure, securely rest; Thy holy guardian's wakeful eyes Admit no slumber nor surprise. V No sun shall smite thy head by day, Nor the pale moon with sickly ray Shall blast thy couch; no baleful star Dart his malignant fire so far. VI Should earth and hell with malice burn, Still thou shalt go and still return, Safe in the Lord; his heavenly care Defends thy life from every snare. VII On thee foul spirits have no power; And in thy last departing hour Angels, that trace the airy road, Shall bear thee homeward to thy God. See the Note on Psalm xli. PSALM 121. (C. M.) Preservation by Day and Night. I To heaven I lift my waiting eyes, There all my hopes are laid: The Lord that built the earth and skies Is my perpetual aid. II Their feet shall never slide to fall, Whom he designs to keep; His ear attends the softest call, His eyes can never sleep. III He will sustain our weakest powers With his almighty arm, And watch our most unguarded hours Against surprising harm. IV Israel, rejoice and rest secure, Thy keeper is the Lord; His wakeful eyes employ his power For thine eternal guard. V Nor scorching sun, nor sickly moon Shall have his leave to smite; He shields thy head from burning noon, From blasting damps at night. VI He guards thy soul, he keeps thy breath Where thickest dangers come; Go and return, secure from death, Till God commands thee home. PSALM 121. As the 148th Psalm. God our Preserver. I Upward I lift mine eyes From God is all my aid; The God that built the skies, And earth and nature made; God is the tower To which I fly; His grace is nigh In every hour. II My feet shall never slide And fall in fatal snares, Since God, my guard and guide, Defends me from my fears: Those wakeful eyes That never sleep Shall Israel keep When dangers rise. III No burning heats by day, Nor blasts of evening air, Shall take my health away, If God be with me there: Thou art my sun, And thou my shade, To guard my head By night or noon. IV Hast thou not given thy word To save my soul from death? And I can trust my Lord To keep my mortal breath: I'll go and come, Nor fear to die, Till from on high Thou call me home. PSALM 122. (C. M.) Going to Church. I How did my heart rejoice to hear My friends devoutly say, ‘In Zion let us all appear, ‘And keep the solemn day!’ II I love her gates, I love the road; The church adorn'd with grace Stands like a palace built for God To shew his milder face. III Up to her courts with joys unknown The holy tribes repair; The son of David holds his throne, And sits in judgment there. IV He hears our praises and complaints; And while his awful voice Divides the sinners from the saints, We tremble and rejoice. V Peace be within this sacred place, And joy a constant guest! With holy gifts and heavenly grace Be her attendants blest! VI My soul shall pray for Zion still, While life or breath remains; There my best friends, my kindred dwell, There God my Saviour reigns. PSALM 122. Proper Tune. The same. [How pleas'd and blest was I] I How pleas'd and blest was I To hear the people cry, ‘Come, let us seek our God to-day!’ Yes, with a cheerful zeal, We haste to Zion's hill, And there our vows and honours pay. II Zion, thrice happy place, Adorn'd with wondrous grace, And walls of strength embrace thee round; In thee our tribes appear To pray, and praise, and hear The sacred gospel's joyful sound. III There David's greater Son Has fix'd his royal throne, He sits for grace and judgment there; He bids the saints be glad, He makes the sinner sad, And humble souls rejoice with fear. IV May peace attend thy gate, And joy within thee wait To bless the soul of every guest! The man that seeks thy peace, And wishes thine increase, A thousand blessings on him rests! V My tongue repeats her vows, ‘Peace to this sacred house!’ For there my friends and kindred dwell; And since my glorious God Makes thee his blest abode, My soul shall ever love thee well. Repeat the fourth stanza to complete the tune. PSALM 123. (C. M.) Pleading with Submission. I O thou whose grace and justice reign Enthron'd above the skies, To thee our hearts would tell their pain, To thee we lift our eyes. II As servant's watch their masters hand, And fear the angry stroke; Or maids before their mistress stand, And wait a peaceful look; III So for our sins we justly feel Thy discipline, O God; Yet wait the gracious moment still, Till thou remove thy rod. IV Those that in wealth and pleasure live Our daily groans deride, And thy delays of mercy give Fresh courage to their pride. V Our foes insult us, but our hope In thy compassion lies; This thought shall bear our spirits up, That God will not despise. PSALM 124. (L. M.) A Song for the Fifth of November. I Had not the Lord, may Israel say, Had not the Lord maintain'd our side, When men, to make our lives a prey, Rose like the swelling of the tide, II The swelling tide had stopt our breath, So fiercely did the waters roll, We had been swallow'd deep in death; Proud waters had o'erwhelm'd our soul. III We leap for joy, we shout and sing, Who just escap'd the fatal stroke; So flies the bird with cheerful wing, When once the fowler's snare is broke. IV For ever blessed be the Lord, Who broke the fowler's cursed snare, Who sav'd us from the murdering sword, And made our lives and souls his care. V Our help is in Jehovah's name, Who form'd the earth, and built the skies; He that upholds that wondrous frame Guards his own church with watchful eyes. PSALM 125. (C. M.) The Saints Trial and Safety. I Unshaken as the sacred hill, And firm as mountains be, Firm as a rock the soul shall rest That leans, O Lord, on thee. II Not walls nor hills could guard so well Old Salem's happy ground, As those eternal arms of love That every saint surround. III While tyrants are a smarting scourge To drive them near to God, Divine compassion does allay The fury of the rod. IV Deal gently, Lord, with souls sincere, And lead them safely on To the bright gates of Paradise, Where Christ their Lord is gone. V But if we trace those crooked ways That the old serpent drew, The wrath that drove him first to hell Shall smite his followers too. PSALM 125. (S. M.) The Saints Trial and Safety; or, moderated Afflictions. I Firm and unmov'd are they That rest their souls on God; Firm as the mount where David dwelt, Or where the ark abode. II As mountains stood to guard The city's sacred ground, So God and his almighty love Embrace his saints around. III What tho' the Father's rod Drop a chastising stroke, Yet, lest it wound their souls too deep, Its fury shall be broke. IV Deal gently, Lord, with those Whose faith and pious fear, Whose hope, and love, and every grace Proclaim their hearts sincere. V Nor shall the tyrant's rage Too long oppress the saint; The God of Israel will support His children lest they faint. VI But if our slavish fear Will choose the road to hell, We must expect our portion there Where bolder sinners dwell. The last stanza of this metre more clearly expresses the true sense of the Psalmist in this place. PSALM 126. (L. M.) Surprising Deliverance. I When God restor'd our captive state, Joy was our song, and grace our theme; The grace beyond our hopes so great, That joy appear'd a painted dream. II The scoffer owns thy hand, and pays Unwilling honours to thy name; While we with pleasure shout thy praise, With cheerful notes thy love proclaim. III When we review our dismal fears, 'Twas hard to think they'd vanish so; With God we left our flowing tears, He makes our joys like rivers flow. IV The man that in his furrow'd field His scatter'd seed with sadness leaves, Will shout to see the harvest yield A welcome load of joyful sheaves. PSALM 128. (C. M.) The Joy of a remarkable Conversion; or, Melancholy removed. I When God reveal'd his gracious name, And chang'd my mournful state, My rapture seem'd a pleasing dream, The grace appear'd so great. II The world beheld the glorious change, And did thy hand confess; My tongue broke out in unknown strains, And sung surprising grace: III ‘Great is the work,’ my neighbours cry'd, And own'd the power divine; ‘Great is the work,’ my heart reply'd, ‘And be the glory thine.’ IV The Lord can clear the darkest skies, Can give us day for night, Make drops of sacred sorrow rise To rivers of delight. V Let those that sow in sadness wait, Till the fair harvest come, They shall confess their sheaves are great, And shout the blessings home. VI Tho' seed lie bury'd long in dust, It shan't deceive their hope; The precious grain can ne'er be lost, For grace insures the crop. PSALM 127. (L. M.) The Blessing of God on the Business and Comforts of Life. I If God succeed, not all the cost And pains to build the house are lost: If God the city will not keep, The watchful guards as well may sleep. II What if you rise before the sun, And work and toil when day is done, Careful and sparing eat your bread To shun that poverty you dread; III 'Tis all in vain, till God hath blest; He can make rich, yet give us rest: Children and friends are blessings too, If God our sovereign make them so. IV Happy the man to whom he sends Obedient children, faithful friends: How sweet our daily comforts prove When they are season'd with his love! PSALM 127. (C. M.) God all in all. I If God to build the house deny, The builders work in vain; And towns, without his wakeful eye, An useless watch maintain. II Before the morning beams arise, Your painful work renew, And till the stars ascend the skies, Your tiresome toil pursue. III Short be your sleep, and coarse your fare; In vain, till God has blest; But if his smiles attend your care, You shall have food and rest. IV Nor children, relatives, nor friends, Shall real blessings prove, Nor all the earthly joys he sends, If sent without his love. PSALM 128. (C. M.) Family Blessings. I O happy man whose soul is fill'd With zeal and reverend awe! His lips to God their honours yield, His life adorns the law. II A careful Providence shall stand And ever guard thy head, Shall on the labours of thy hand Its kindly blessings shed. III Thy wife shall be a fruitful vine; Thy children round thy board, Each like a plant of honour shine, And learn to fear the Lord. IV The Lord shall thy best hopes fulfil For months and years to come; The Lord, who dwells on Zion's hill, Shall send thee blessings home. V This is the man whose happy eyes Shall see his house increase, Shall see the sinking church arise, Then leave the world in peace. PSALM 129. (C. M.) Persecutors punished. I Up from my youth, may Israel say, Have I been nurs'd in tears; My griefs were constant as the day, And tedious as the years. II Up from my youth I bore the rage Of all the sons of strife; Oft they assail'd my riper age, But not destroy'd my life. III Their cruel plough had torn my flesh With furrows long and deep, Hourly they vex my wounds afresh, Nor let my sorrows sleep. IV The Lord grew angry on his throne, And with impartial eye Measur'd the mischiefs they had done, Then let his arrows fly. V How was their insolence surpris'd To hear his thunders roll! And all the foes of Zion siez'd With horror to the soul. VI Thus shall the men that hate the saints Be blasted from the sky; Their glory fades, their courage faints, And all their projects die. VII What tho' they flourish tall and fair, They have no root beneath; Their growth shall perish in despair, And lie despis'd in death. VIII So corn that on the house-top stands No hope of harvest gives; The reaper ne'er shall fill his hands, Nor binder fold the sheaves. IX It springs and withers on the place: No traveller bestows A word of blessing on the grass, Nor minds it as he goes. PSALM 130. (C. M.) Pardoning Grace. I Out of the deeps of long distress, The borders of despair, I sent my cries to seek thy grace, My groans to move thine ear. II Great God, should thy severer eye, And thine impartial hand, Mark and revenge iniquity, No mortal flesh could stand. III But there are pardons with my God For crimes of high degree; Thy Son has bought them with his blood To draw us near to thee. IV I wait for thy salvation, Lord, With strong desires I wait; My soul, invited by thy word, Stands watching at thy gate. V Just as the guards that keep the night Long for the morning skies, Watch the first beams of breaking light, And meet them with their eyes; VI So waits my soul to see thy grace, And more intent than they, Meets the first openings of thy face, And finds a brighter day. VII Then in the Lord let Israel trust, Let Israel seek his face; The Lord is good as well as just, And plenteous is his grace. VIII There's full redemption at his throne For sinners long enslav'd; The great Redeemer is his Son, And Israel shall be sav'd. PSALM 130. (L. M.) Pardoning Grace. I From deep distress and troubled thoughts, To thee, my God, I rais'd my cries; If thou severely mark our faults, No flesh can stand before thine eyes. II But thou hast built thy throne of grace, Free to dispense thy pardons there, That sinners may approach thy face, And hope and love, as well as fear. III As the benighted pilgrims wait, And long, and wish for breaking day, So waits my soul before thy gate; When will my God his face display? IV My trust is fix'd upon thy word, Nor shall I trust thy word in vain: Let mourning souls address the Lord And find relief from all their pain. V Great is his love, and large his grace, Thro' the redemption of his Son: He turns our feet from sinful ways, And pardons what our hands have done. PSALM 131. (C. M.) Humility and Submission. I Is there ambition in my heart? Search, gracious God, and see; Or do I act a haughty part? Lord, I appeal to thee. II I charge my thoughts, be humble still, And all my carriage mild, Content, my Father, with thy will, And quiet as a child. III The patient soul, the lowly mind Shall have a large reward: Let saints in sorrow lie resign'd, And trust a faithful Lord. PSALM 132. v. 5, 13–18. (L. M.) At the Settlement of a Church; or, the Ordination of a Minister. I Where shall we go to seek and find An habitation for our God, A dwelling for th'Eternal Mind Amongst the sons of flesh and blood? II The God of Jacob chose the hill Of Zion for his ancient rest; And Zion is his dwelling still, His church is with his presence blest. III Here will I fix my gracious throne, And reign for ever, saith the Lord: Here shall my power and love be known, And blessings shall attend my word. IV Here will I meet the hungry poor, And fill their souls with living bread; Sinners that wait before my door, With sweet provision shall be fed. V Girded with truth and cloth'd with grace, My priests, my ministers shall shine: Not Aaron in his costly dress, Made an appearance so divine. VI The saints, unable to contain Their inward joys, shall shout and sing; The Son of David here shall reign, And Zion triumph in her King. VII Jesus shall see a numerous seed Born here, t'uphold his glorious name; His crown shall flourish on his head, While all his foes are cloth'd with shame! PSALM 132. v. 4, 5, 7, 8, 15–17. (C. M.) A Church established. I No sleep nor slumber to his eyes Good David would afford, Till he had found below the skies A dwelling for the Lord. II The Lord in Zion plac'd his name, Thrice in the year shall all your male-children appear before the Lord, &amp;c. Exod. xxxiv. 23. His ark was settled there; To Zion the whole nation came To worship thrice a year. III But we have no such lengths to go, Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them, Matt. xviii. 20. The house of God, the church, &amp;c. 1 Tim. iii. 15. Nor wander far abroad; Where'er thy saints assemble now, There is a house for God. IV Arise, O King of grace, arise, And enter to thy rest! Lo! thy church waits, with longing eyes, Thus to be own'd and blest. V Enter with all thy glorious train, Thy Spirit and thy word; All that the ark did once contain Could no such grace afford. VI Here, mighty God, accept our vows, Here let thy praise be spread; Bless the provisions of thy house, And fill thy poor with bread. VII Here let the Son of David reign, Let God's Anointed shine; Justice and truth his court maintain, With love and power divine. VIII Here let him hold a lasting throne; And as his kingdom grows, Fresh honours shall adorn his crown, And shame confound his foes. The settlement of the ark in Zion is a fair type of the dwelling of Christ in his churches; and I have so copied this psalm in both metres, omitting the verses less necessary to this sense. PSALM 133. (C. M.) Brotherly Love. I Lo! what an entertaining sight Are brethren that agree, Brethren, whose cheerful hearts unite In bands of piety! II When streams of love from Christ the spring Descend to every soul, And heavenly peace, with balmy wing, Shades and bedews the whole; III 'Tis like the oil divinely sweet, On Aaron's reverend head, The trickling drops perfum'd his feet, And o'er his garments spread. IV 'Tis pleasant as the morning dews That fall on Zion's hill, Where God his mildest glory shews, And makes his grace distil. PSALM 133. (S. M.) Communion of Saints; or, Love and Worship in a Family. I Blest are the sons of peace, Whose hearts and hopes are one, Whose kind designs to serve and please, Thro' all their actions run. II Blest is the pious house Where zeal and friendship meet, Their songs of praise, their mingled vows Make their communion sweet. III Thus when on Aaron's head They pour'd the rich perfume The oil thro' all his raiment spread, And pleasure fill'd the room. IV Thus on the heavenly hills The saints are blest above, Where joy like morning-dew distils, And all the air is love. PSALM 133. As the 122d Psalm. The Blessings of Friendship. I How pleasant 'tis to see Kindred and friends agree, Each in their proper station move, And each fulfil their part, With sympathising heart, In all the cares of life and love! II 'Tis like the ointment shed On Aaron's sacred head, Divinely rich, divinely sweet; The oil thro' all the room, Diffus'd a choice perfume, Ran thro' his robes, and blest his feet. III Like fruitful showers of rain, That water all the plain, Descending from the neighbouring hills; Such streams of pleasure roll Thro' every friendly soul, Where love like heavenly dew distils. Repeat the first stanza to complete the tune. PSALM 134. (C. M.) Daily and nightly Devotion. I Ye that obey the Immortal King, Attend his holy place, Bow to the glories of his power, And bless his wondrous grace. II Lift up your hands by morning light, And send your souls on high; Raise your admiring thoughts by night Above the starry sky. III The God of Zion cheers our hearts With rays of quickening grace; The God that spread the heavens abroad, And rules the swelling seas. This psalm, with several others near it, is called a Song of Degrees; that is, to be sung on the steps ascending to the tabernacle or temple, as the learned suppose: The king and his attendants sung the two first verses, addressing themselves to the levites that kept the house of the Lord; and the third verse is the response of the levites to the king. There was a necessity of changing the form of this psalm, to suit it to our usual christian worship. PSALM 135. v. 1–4, 14, 19–21. First Part. (L. M.) The Church is God's House and Care. I Praise ye the Lord, exalt his name, While in his holy courts ye wait, Ye saints, that to his house belong, Or stand attending at his gate. II Praise ye the Lord: the Lord is good; To praise his name is sweet employ: Israel he chose of old, and still His church is his peculiar joy. III The Lord himself will judge his saints; He treats his servants as his friends; And when he hears their sore complaints, Repents the sorrows that he sends. IV Thro' every age the Lord declares His name, and breaks th'oppressor's rod; He gives his suffering servants rest, And will be known, ‘Th'almighty God.’ V Bless ye the Lord, who taste his love, People and priests exalt his name: Amongst his saints he ever dwells; His church is his Jerusalem. PSALM 135. v. 5–12. Second Part. (L. M.) The Works of Creation, Providence, Redemption of Israel, and Destruction of Enemies. I Great is the Lord, exalted high Above all powers and every throne; Whate'er he please in earth or sea, Or heaven or hell, his hand hath done. II At his command the vapours rise, The lightnings flash, the thunders roar: He pours the rain, he brings the wind, And tempest from his airy store. III 'Twas he those dreadful tokens sent, O Egypt, thro' thy stubborn land; When all thy first-born beasts and men Fell dead by his avenging hand. IV What mighty nations, mighty kings, He slew, and their whole country gave To Israel, whom his hand redeem'd No more to be proud Pharaoh's slave! V His power the same, the same his grace, That saves us from the hosts of hell; And heaven he gives us to possess, Whence those apostate angels fell. This psalm was too long to be sung at once, yet I could not reduce it into two parts conveniently, without transposing the verses considerably, as in the title. The ejection of the Canaanites, and the inheritance of their land given to Israel, is a fair figure of the inheritance of heaven given to the saints; whence sinning angels were ejected, as in the last stanza. PSALM 135. (C. M.) Praise due to God, not to Idols. I Awake, ye saints; to praise your King, Your sweetest passions raise, Your pious pleasure, while you sing, Increasing with the praise. II Great is the Lord; and works unknown Are his divine employ; But still his saints are near his throne, His treasure and his joy. III Heaven, earth, and sea, confess his hand; He bids the vapours rise; Lightning and storm at his command Sweep thro' the sounding skies. IV All power that gods or kings have claim'd Is found with him alone; But heathen gods should ne'er be nam'd Where our Jehovah's known. V Which of the stocks or stones they trust Can give them showers of rain? In vain they worship glittering dust, And pray to gold in vain. VI Their gods have tongues that cannot talk, Such as their makers gave: Their feet were ne'er design'd to walk, Nor hands have power to save. VII Blind are their eyes, their ears are deaf, Nor hear when mortals pray; Mortals that wait for their relief, Are blind and deaf as they. VIII O Britain know thy living God, Serve him with faith and fear; He makes thy churches his abode, And claims thine honours there. This psalm is much abridged in this metre, to reduce the most useful parts of it to one shorter divine song. In the 5th stanza I have borrowed a verse from Jer. xiv. 22. Are there any among the vanities of the gentiles that can cause rain? PSALM 136. (C. M.) God's Wonders of Creation, Providence, Redemption of Israel, and Salvation of his People. I Give thanks to God the sovereign Lord; His mercies still endure! And be the King of kings ador'd; His truth is ever sure. II What wonders hath his wisdom done! How mighty is his hand! Heaven, earth, and sea, he fram'd alone: How wide is his command! III The sun supplies the day with light; How bright his counsels shine! The moon and stars adorn the night; His works are all divine! IV He struck the sons of Egypt dead; How dreadful is his rod! And thence with joy his people led: How gracious is our God! V He cleft the swelling sea in two; His arm is great in might, And gave the tribes a passage thro'; His power and grace unite. VI But Pharaoh's army there he drown'd; How glorious are his ways! And brought his saints thro' desert ground: Eternal be his praise. VII Great monarchs fell beneath his hand, Victorious is his sword; While Israel took the promis'd land; And faithful is his word. VIII He saw the nations dead in sin; He felt his pity move: How sad the state the world was in! How boundless was his love! IX He sent to save us from our woe; His goodness never fails; From death, and hell, and every foe; And still his grace prevails. X Give thanks to God the heavenly King; His mercies still endure! Let the whole earth his praises sing; His truth is ever sure. In every stanza of this psalm I have endeavoured to imitate the chorus or burden of the song, For his mercy endureth for ever; and yet to maintain a perpetual variety. PSALM 146. (as the 148th Psalm.) The same. [Give thanks to God most high] I Give thanks to God most high, The universal Lord; The sovereign King of kings; And be his grace ador'd. His power and grace Are still the same; And let his name Have endless praise. II How mighty is his hand! What wonders hath he done! He form'd the earth and seas, And spread the heavens alone. Thy mercy, Lord, Shall still endure; And ever sure Abides thy word. III His wisdom fram'd the sun To crown the day with light; The moon and twinkling stars To cheer the darksome night. His power and grace Are still the same; And let his name Have endless praise. IV He smote the first-born sons, The flower of Egypt, dead: And thence his chosen tribes With joy and glory led. Thy mercy, Lord, Shall still endure; And ever sure Abides thy word. V His power and lifted rod Cleft the Red Sea in two, And for his people made A wondrous passage thro'. His power and grace Are still the same; And let his name Have endless praise. VI But cruel Pharaoh there With all his host he drown'd; And brought his Israel safe Through a long desert ground. Thy mercy, Lord, Shall still endure; And ever sure Abides thy word. VII The kings of Canaan fell Beneath his dreadful hand; While his own servants took Possession of their land. His power and grace Are still the same; And let his name Have endless praise. VIII He saw the nations lie All perishing in sin, And pity'd the sad state The ruin'd world was in. Thy mercy, Lord, Shall still endure; And ever sure Abides thy word. IX He sent his only Son To save us from our woe, From Satan, sin, and death, And every hurtful foe. His power and grace Are still the same; And let his name Have endless praise. X Give thanks aloud to God, To God the heavenly King; And let the spacious earth His works and glories sing. Thy mercy, Lord, Shall still endure; And ever sure Abides thy word. In this metre and the next, I have maintained the chorus, For his mercy endureth for ever, in a double form, to be used alternately, that is, in every other stanza. PSALM 136. Abridged. (L. M.) God's Wonders of Creation, Providence, Redemption, and Salvation. I Give to our God immortal praise; Mercy and truth are all his ways: ‘Wonders of grace to God belong, ‘Repeat his mercies in your song.’ II Give to the Lord of lords renown The King of kings with glory crown: ‘His mercies ever shall endure, ‘When’ lords and kings are known ‘no more.’ III He built the earth, he spread the sky, And fix'd the starry lights on high: ‘Wonders of grace to God belong, ‘Repeat his mercies in your song.’ IV He fills the sun with morning light, He bids the moon direct the night: ‘His mercies ever shall endure, ‘When’ suns and moons shall shine ‘no more.’ V The Jews he freed from Pharaoh's hand, And brought them to the promis'd land: ‘Wonders of grace to God belong, ‘Repeat his mercies in your song.’ VI He saw the Gentiles dead in sin, And felt his pity work within: ‘His mercies ever shall endure, ‘When’ death and sin shall reign ‘no more.’ VII He sent his Son with power to save From guilt, and darkness, and the grave: ‘Wonders of grace to God belong, ‘Repeat his mercies in your song.’ VIII Through this vain world he guides our feet And leads us to his heavenly seat: ‘His mercies ever shall endure, ‘When’ this vain world shall be ‘no more.’ PSALM 138. (L. M.) Restoring and preserving Grace. I With all my powers of heart and tongue Angels or Kings are the Gods before whom the Psalmist would sing praise to his Creator; but common Christians having so little of the presence of kings in their worship, I have mentioned only the company of angels. I'll praise my Maker in my song: Angels shall hear the notes I raise, Approve the song and join the praise. II Angels that make thy church their care Angels or Kings are the Gods before whom the Psalmist would sing praise to his Creator; but common Christians having so little of the presence of kings in their worship, I have mentioned only the company of angels. Shall witness my devotions there, While holy zeal directs my eyes To thy fair temple in the skies. III I'll sing thy truth and mercy, Lord, I'll sing the wonders of thy word; Not all thy works and names below So much thy power and glory show. IV To God I cry'd when troubles rose; He heard me, and subdu'd my foes, He did my rising fears control, And strength diffus'd thro' all my soul. V The God of heaven maintains his state, Frowns on the proud and scorns the great; But from his throne descends to see The sons of humble poverty. VI Amidst a thousand snares I stand Upheld and guarded by thy hand; Thy words my fainting soul revive, And keep my dying faith alive. VII Grace will complete what grace begins To save from sorrows or from sins; The work that wisdom undertakes Eternal mercy ne'er forsakes. PSALM 139 First Part. (L. M.) The All-seeing God. I Lord, thou hast search'd and seen me thro'; Thine eye commands with piercing view My rising and my resting hours, My heart and flesh with all their powers. II My thoughts, before they are my own, Are to my God distinctly known; He knows the words I mean to speak Ere from my op'ning lips they break. III Within thy circling power I stand; On every side I find thy hand: Awake, asleep, at home, abroad, I am surrounded still with God. IV Amazing knowledge, vast and great! What large extent! what lofty height! My soul, with all the powers I boast, Is in the boundless prospect lost. V ‘O may these thoughts possess my breast, ‘Where'er I rove, where'er I rest! ‘Nor let my weaker passions dare ‘Consent to sin, for God is there.’ VI Could I so false, so faithless prove, To quit thy service and thy love, Where, Lord, could I thy presence shun, Or from thy dreadful glory run? VII If up to heaven I take my flight, 'Tis there thou dwell'st enthron'd in light; Or dive to hell, there vengeance reigns, And Satan groans beneath thy chains. VIII If mounted on a morning ray, I fly beyond the western sea, Thy swifter hand would first arrive, And there arrest thy fugitive. IX Or should I try to shun thy sight Beneath the spreading veil of night, One glance of thine, one piercing ray, Would kindle darkness into day. X ‘O may these thoughts possess my breast, ‘Where'er I rove, where'er I rest! ‘Nor let my weaker passions dare ‘Consent to sin, for God is there.’ XI The veil of night is no disguise, No screen from thy all-searching eyes; Thy hand can seize thy foes as soon Thro' midnight shades as blazing noon. XII Midnight and noon in this agree, Great God, they're both alike to thee: Not death can hide what God will spy, And hell lies naked to his eye. XIII ‘O may these thoughts possess my breast, ‘Where'er I rove, where'er I rest! ‘Nor let my weaker passions dare ‘Consent to sin, for God is there.’ PSALM 139. Second Part. (L. M.) The wonderful Formation of Man. I 'Twas from thy hand, my God, I came, A work of such a curious frame; In me thy fearful wonders shine, And each proclaims thy skill divine. II Thine eyes did all my limbs survey, Which yet in dark confusion lay; Thou saw'st the daily growth they took, Form'd by the model of thy book. III By thee my growing parts were nam'd, And what thy sovereign counsels fram'd, (The breathing lungs, the beating heart) Was copy'd with unerring art. IV At last, to shew my Maker's name, God stamp'd his image on my frame, And in some unknown moment join'd The finish'd members to the mind. V There the young seeds of thought began And all the passions of the man: Great God, our infant nature pays Immortal tribute to thy praise. VI Lord, since in my advancing age I've acted on life's busy stage, Thy thoughts of love to me surmount The power of numbers to recount. VII I could survey the ocean o'er, And count each sand that makes the shore, Before my swiftest thoughts could trace The numerous wonders of thy grace. VIII These on my heart are still imprest, With these I give my eyes to rest; And at my waking hour I find God and his love possess my mind. PSALM 139. Third Part. (L. M.) Sincerity professed, and Grace tried; or, the Heart-searching God. I My God, what inward grief I feel When impious men transgress thy will! I mourn to hear their lips profane Take thy tremendous name in vain. II Does not my soul detest and hate The sons of malice and deceit? Those that oppose thy laws and thee I count them enemies to me. III Lord, search my soul, try every thought; Though my own heart accuse me not Of walking in a false disguise, I beg the trial of thine eyes. IV Doth secret mischief lurk within? Do I indulge some unknown sin? O turn my feet whene'er I stray, And lead me in thy perfect way. In this noble psalm I have not refused the aid of my predecessors, chiefly Mr. Tate. In some places where I have borrowed, I hope I have improved the verse; and in others, my own design constrained me to leave out the words of a more poetic sound, such as infernal plains, morning's wings, western main, sable wings of night, shapeless embryo, maze of life, &amp;c. yet I have endeavoured to maintain the spirit of the Psalmist in plainer language. The epiphonema or the burden of the song, that I have inserted three times in the first part, was not introduced by any means to add beauty to the Poem, but merely to reduce it to convenient lengths for singing, which has too often confined the Ode, and debased it. PSALM 139. First Part. (C. M.) God is every where. I In all my vast concerns with thee In vain my soul would try To shun thy presence, Lord, or flee The notice of thine eye. II Thy all-surrounding sight surveys My rising and my rest, My public walks, my private ways, And secrets of my breast. III My thoughts lie open to the Lord Before they're form'd within: And ere my lips pronounce the word, He knows the sense I mean. IV O wondrous knowledge, deep and high! Where can a creature hide? Within thy circling arms I lie, Beset on every side. V So let thy grace surround me still, And like a bulwark prove, To guard my soul from every ill, Secur'd by sovereign love. VI Lord, where shall guilty souls retire, Forgotten and unknown? In hell they meet thy dreadful fire, In heaven thy glorious throne. VII Should I suppress my vital breath To 'scape the wrath divine, Thy voice would break the bars of death, And make the grave resign. VIII If wing'd with beams of morning-light, I fly beyond the west, Thy hand, which must support my flight, Would soon betray my rest. IX If o'er my sins I think to draw The curtains of the night, Those flaming eyes that guard thy law Would turn the shades to light. X The beams of noon, the midnight hour, Are both alike to thee; O may I ne'er provoke that power From which I cannot flee! PSALM 139. Second Part. (C.M.) The Wisdom of God in the Formation of Man. I When I with pleasing wonder stand, And all my frame survey, Lord, 'tis thy work; I own thy hand Thus built my humble clay. II Thy hand my heart and reins possest Where unborn nature grew, Thy wisdom all my features trac'd, And all my members drew. III Thine eye with nicest care survey'd The growth of every part; Till the whole scheme thy thoughts had laid Was copy'd by thy art. IV Heaven, earth, and sea, and fire, and wind, Shew me thy wondrous skill; But I review myself, and find Diviner wonders still. V Thy awful glories round me shine, My flesh proclaims thy praise; Lord, to thy works of nature join Thy miracles of grace. PSALM 139. v. 14, 17, 18. Third Part. (C. M.) The Mercies of God innumerable. An Evening Psalm. I Lord, when I count thy mercies o'er, They strike me with surprise; Not all the sands that spread the shore To equal numbers rise. II My flesh with fear and wonder stands, The product of thy skill, And hourly blessings from thy hands, Thy thoughts of love reveal. III These on my heart by night I keep; How kind, how dear to me! O may the hour that ends my sleep Still find my thoughts with thee. PSALM 141. v. 2–5. (L. M.) Watchfulness and brotherly Reproof. A Morning or Evening Psalm. I My God, accept my early vows, Like morning-incense in thine house, And let my nightly worship rise Sweet as the evening sacrifice. II Watch o'er my lips, and guard them, Lord, From every rash and heedless word; Nor let my feet incline to tread The guilty path where sinners lead. III O may the righteous, when I stray, Smite, and reprove my wandering way! Their gentle words, like ointment shed, Shall never bruise, but cheer my head. IV When I behold them prest with grief, I'll cry to heaven for their relief; And by my warm petitions prove How much I prize their faithful love. PSALM 142. (C. M.) God is the Hope of the Helpless. I To God I made my sorrows known, From God I sought relief: In long complaints before his throne I pour'd out all my grief. II My soul was overwhelm'd with woes, My heart began to break; My God, who all my burdens knows, He knows the way I take. III On every side I cast mine eye, And found my helpers gone, While friends and strangers pass'd me by Neglected or unknown. IV Then did I raise a louder cry, And call'd thy mercy near, ‘Thou art my portion when I die, ‘Be thou my refuge here.’ V Lord, I am brought exceeding low, Now let thine ear attend, And make my foes who vex me know I've an almighty friend. VI From my sad prison set me free, Then shall I praise thy name, And holy men shall join with me Thy kindness to proclaim. PSALM 143. (L. M.) Complaint of heavy Afflictions in Mind and Body. I My righteous Judge, my gracious God, Hear when I spread my hands abroad And cry for succour from thy throne, O make thy truth and mercy known. II Let judgment not against me pass; Behold thy servant pleads thy grace; Should justice call us to thy bar, No man alive is guiltless there. III Look down in pity, Lord, and see The mighty woes that burden me; Down to the dust my life is brought, Like one long bury'd and forgot. IV I dwell in darkness and unseen, My heart is desolate within; My thoughts in musing silence trace The ancient wonders of thy grace. V Thence I derive a glimpse of hope To bear my sinking spirits up; I stretch my hands to God again, And thirst like parched lands for rain. VI For thee I thirst, I pray, I mourn; When will thy smiling face return? Shall all my joys on earth remove? And God for ever hide his love? VII My God, thy long delay to save Will sink thy prisoner to the grave; My heart grows faint, and dim mine eye; Make haste to help before I die. VIII The night is witness to my tears, Distressing pains, distressing fears; O might I hear thy morning voice, How would my weary'd powers rejoice! IX In thee I trust, to thee I sigh, And lift my heavy soul on high, For thee sit waiting all the day, And wear the tiresome hours away. X Break off my fetters, Lord, and show Which is the path my feet should go; If snares and foes beset the road, I flee to hide me near my God. XI Teach me to do thy holy will, And lead me to thy heavenly hill; Let the good Spirit of thy love Conduct me to thy courts above. XII Then shall my soul no more complain, The tempter then shall rage in vain; And flesh that was my foe before, Shall never vex my spirit more. PSALM 144. v. 1, 2. First Part. (C. M.) Assistance and Victory in the spiritual Warfare. I For ever blessed be the Lord, My Saviour and my shield; He sends his Spirit with his word To arm me for the field. II When sin and hell their force unite, He makes my soul his care, Instructs me to the heavenly fight, And guards me thro' the war. III A friend and helper so divine Doth my weak courage raise; He makes the glorious victory mine, And his shall be the praise. The sense of a great part of this psalm is found often repeated in the Book of Psalms. I have therefore only taken three small parts of it, and formed three distinct hymns on very different subjects. PSALM 144. v. 3–6. Second Part. (C. M.) The Vanity of Man, and Condescension of God. I Lord, what is man, poor feeble man, Born of the earth at first! His life a shadow, light and vain, Still hasting to the dust. II O what is feeble dying man Or any of his race, That God should make it his concern To visit him with grace! III That God who darts his lightnings down, Who shakes the worlds above, And mountains tremble at his frown, How wondrous is his love. PSALM 144. v. 12–15. Third Part. (L. M.) Grace above Riches; or, the happy Nation. I Happy the city, where their sons Like pillars round a palace set, And daughters bright as polish'd stones Give strength and beauty to the state. II Happy the country, where the sheep, Cattle, and corn, have large increase; Where men securely work or sleep, Nor sons of plunder break the peace. III Happy the nation thus endow'd, But more divinely blest are those On whom the all-sufficient God Himself with all his grace bestows. PSALM 145. (S. M.) The Greatness of God. I My God, my King, thy various praise Shall fill the remnant of my days; Thy grace employ my humble tongue Till death and glory raise the song. II The wings of every hour shall bear Some thankful tribute to thine ear; And every setting sun shall see New works of duty done for thee. III Thy truth and justice I'll proclaim; Thy bounty flows, an endless stream, Thy mercy swift, thine anger slow, But dreadful to the stubborn foe. IV Thy works with sovereign glory shine, And speak thy majesty divine; Let Britain round her shores proclaim The sound and honour of thy name. V Let distant times and nations raise The long succession of thy praise; And unborn ages make my song The joy and labour of their tongue. VI But who can speak thy wondrous deeds? Thy greatness all our thoughts exceeds! Vast and unsearchable thy ways! Vast and immortal be thy praise. The verses of this psalm are here transposed in this manner; namely, 1, 2, 7, 8, 5, 6, 4, 3. PSALM 145. v. 1–7, 11–13. First Part. (C. M.) The same. [Long as I live I'll bless thy name] I Long as I live I'll bless thy name, My King, my God of love; My work and joy shall be the same In the bright world above. II Great is the Lord, his power unknown, And let his praise be great: I'll sing the honours of thy throne, Thy works of grace repeat. III Thy grace shall dwell upon my tongue; And while my lips rejoice, The men that hear my sacred song Shall join their cheerful voice. IV Fathers to sons shall teach thy name, And children learn thy ways; Ages to come thy truth proclaim, And nations sound thy praise. V Thy glorious deeds of ancient date Shall thro' the world be known; Thine arm of power, thy heavenly state, With public splendor shown. VI The world is manag'd by thy hands, Thy saints are rul'd by love; And thine eternal kingdom stands, Tho' rocks and hills remove. PSALM 145. v. 7, &amp;c. Second Part. (C. M.) The Goodness of God. I Sweet is the memory of thy grace, My God, my heavenly King! Let age to age thy righteousness In sounds of glory sing. II God reigns on high, but not confines His goodness to the skies; Thro' the whole earth his bounty shines, And every want supplies. III With longing eyes thy creatures wait On thee for daily food, Thy lib'ral hand provides their meat And fills their mouths with good. IV How kind are thy compassions, Lord! How slow thine anger moves! But soon he sends his pardoning word To cheer the souls he loves. V Creatures, with all their endless race, Thy power and praise proclaim; But saints that taste thy richer grace Delight to bless thy name. The verses of this psalm are here transposed thus, 7, 9, 15, 16, 8, 10. PSALM 145. v 14, 17, &amp;c. Third Part. (C. M.) Mercy to Sufferers; or, God hearing Prayer. I Let every tongue thy goodness speak, Thou sovereign Lord of all; Thy strengthening hands uphold the weak, And raise the poor that fall. II When sorrow bows the spirit down, Or virtue lies distrest Beneath some proud oppressor's frown, Thou giv'st the mourners rest. III The Lord supports our tottering days, And guides our giddy youth; Holy and just are all his ways, And all his words are truth. IV He knows the pains his servants feel, He hears his children cry, And their best wishes to fulfil His grace is ever nigh. V His mercy never shall remove From men of heart sincere; He saves the souls whose humble love Is join'd with holy fear. VI His stubborn foes his sword shall slay, And pierce their hearts with pain; But none that serve the Lord shall say, ‘They sought his aid in vain.’ VII My lips shall dwell upon his praise, And spread his fame abroad; Let all the sons of Adam raise The honours of their God. The various transpositions that I have made in several parts of this psalm, were necessary to divide it into proper lengths for public worship, and to reduce the verses of a like sense together. PSALM 146. (L. M.) Praise to God for his Goodness and Truth. I Praise ye the Lord, my heart shall join In work so pleasant, so divine, Now while the flesh is mine abode, And when my soul ascends to God. II Praise shall employ my noblest powers, While immortality endures; My days of praise shall ne'er be past, While life and thought and being last. III Why should I make a man my trust? Princes must die and turn to dust; Their breath departs, their pomp and power And thoughts, all vanish in an hour. IV Happy the man whose hopes rely On Israel's God: he made the sky, And earth and seas with all their train, And none shall find his promise vain. V His truth for ever stands secure; He saves th'opprest, he feeds the poor; He sends the labouring conscience peace, And grants the prisoner sweet release. VI The Lord hath eyes to give the blind; The Lord supports the sinking mind; He helps the stranger in distress, The widow and the fatherless. VII He loves his saints, he knows them well, But turns the wicked down to hell: Thy God, O Zion, ever reigns; Praise him in everlasting strains. This psalm consists so much in single sentences, that a small and easy transposition of the verses, with a very few lines added, will afford a metre to the tune of the cxiiith psalm, with a repetition of the first stanza at the end to complete the tune, as follows. PSALM 146. As the 113th Psalm. Praise to God for his Goodness and Truth. I I'll praise my Maker with my breath; And when my voice is lost in death Praise shall employ my nobler powers: My days of praise shall ne'er be past While life and thought and being last, Or immortality endures. II Why should I make a man my trust? Princes must die and turn to dust; Vain is the help of flesh and blood: Their breath departs, their pomp and power, And thoughts all vanish in an hour, Nor can they make their promise good. III Happy the man whose hopes rely On Israel's God: he made the sky, And earth and seas with all their train; His truth for ever stands secure; He saves th'opprest, he feeds the poor, And none shall find his promise vain. IV The Lord hath eyes to give the blind; The Lord supports the sinking mind; He sends the labouring conscience peace: He helps the stranger in distress, The widow and the fatherless, And grants the prisoner sweet release. V He loves his saints; he knows them well, But turns the wicked down to hell; Thy God, O Zion, ever reigns: Let every tongue let every age, In this exalted work engage; Praise him in everlasting strains. VI I'll praise him while he lends me breath, And when my voice is lost in death Praise shall employ my nobler powers: My days of praise shall ne'er be past While life and thought and being last, Or immortality endures. PSALM 147. First Part. (L. M.) The divine Nature, Providence and Grace. I Praise ye the Lord; 'tis good to raise Our hearts and voices in his praise; His nature and his works invite To make this duty our delight. II The Lord builds up Jerusalem, And gathers nations to his name: His mercy melts the stubborn soul, And makes the broken spirit whole. III He form'd the stars, those heavenly flames, He counts their numbers, calls their names: His wisdom's vast, and knows no bound, A deep where all our thoughts are drown'd. IV Great is our Lord, and great his might; And all his glories infinite: He crowns the meek, rewards the just, And treads the wicked to the dust. V Sing to the Lord, exalt him high, Who spreads his cloud all round the sky; There he prepares the fruitful rain, Nor lets the drops descend in vain. VI He makes the grass the hills adorn, And clothes the smiling fields with corn, The beasts with food his hands supply, And the young ravens when they cry. VII What is the creature's skill or force, The sprightly man, the warlike horse, The nimble wit, the active limb? All are too mean delights for him. VIII But saints are lovely in his sight; He views his children with delight: He sees their hope, he knows their fear, And looks and loves his image there. PSALM 147. Second Part. (L. M.) Summer and Winter. A Song for Great Britian. I O Britain, praise thy mighty God, And make his honours known abroad; He bid the ocean round thee flow; Not bars of brass could guard thee so. II Thy children are secure and blest; Thy shores have peace, thy cities rest; He feeds thy sons with finest wheat, And adds his blessing to their meat. III Thy changing seasons he ordains, Thine early and thy later rains. His flakes of snow like wool he sends, And thus the springing corn defends. IV With hoary frost he strews the ground; His hail descends with clattering sound: Where is the man so vainly bold That dares defy his dreadful cold? V He bids the southern breezes blow, The ice dissolves, the waters flow: But he hath nobler works and ways To call the Britons to his praise. VI To all the isle his laws are shown, His gospel thro' the nation known; He hath not thus reveal'd his word To every land: Praise ye the Lord. PSALM 147. v. 7–9, 13–18. (C. M.) The Seasons of the Year. I With songs and honours sounding loud Address the Lord on high: Over the heavens he spreads his cloud, And waters veil the sky. II He sends his showers of blessing down To cheer the plains below; He makes the grass the mountains crown, And corn in vallies grow. III He gives the grazing ox his meat, He hears the ravens cry; But man, who tastes his finest wheat, Should raise his honours high. IV His steady counsels change the face Of the declining year; He bids the son cut short his race, And wintry days appear. V His hoary frost, his fleecy snow Descend and clothe the ground; The liquid streams forbear to flow, In icy fetters bound. VI When from his dreadful stores on high He pours the rattling hail, The wretch that dares this God defy Shall find his courage fail. VII He sends his word and melts the snow, The fields no longer mourn; He calls the warmer gales to blow, And bids the spring return. VIII The changing wind, the flying cloud, Obey his mighty word: With songs and honours sounding loud, Praise ye the sovereign Lord. PSALM 148. (P. M.) Praise to God from all Creatures. I Ye tribes of Adam, join With heaven, and earth, and seas, And offer notes divine To your Creator's praise: Ye holy throng Of angels bright, In worlds of light Begin the song. II Thou sun with dazzling rays, And moon that rules the night, Shine to your Maker's praise, With stars of twinkling light: His power declare, Ye floods on high, And clouds that fly In empty air. III The shining worlds above In glorious order stand, Or in swift courses move By his supreme command: He spake the word, And all their frame From nothing came To praise the Lord. IV He mov'd their mighty wheels In unknown ages past, And each his word fulfils While time and nature last: In different ways His works proclaim His wondrous name, And speak his prase. V Let all the earth-born race, Let monsters of the deep, The fish that cleave the seas Or in their bosom sleep, From sea and shore Their tribute pay, And still display Their Maker's power. VI Ye vapours, hail, and snow, Praise ye th'Almighty Lord, And stormy winds that blow To execute his word: When lightnings shine, Or thunders roar, Let earth adore His hand divine. VII Ye mountains near the skies, With lofty cedars there, And trees of humbler size That fruit in plenty bear; Beasts wild and tame, Birds, flies, and worms, In various forms Exalt his name. VIII Ye kings and judges, fear The Lord, the sovereign King; And while you rule us here, His heavenly honours sing: Nor let the dream Of power and state Make you forget His power supreme. IX Virgins, and youths, engage To sound his praise divine, While infancy and age Their feebler voices join: Wide as he reigns His name be sung By every tongue In endless strains. X Let all the nations fear The God that rules above; He brings his people near, And makes them taste his love: While earth and sky Attempt his praise, His saints shall raise His honours high. PSALM 148. Paraphrased. (L, M.) Universal Praise to God. I Loud hallelujahs to the Lord, From distant worlds where creatures dwell; Let heaven begin the solemn word, And sound it dreadful down to hell.Note, This psalm may be sung to the tune of the old 112th or 127th psalm, if these two lines be added to every stanza, namely, Each of his works his name displays, But they can ne'er fulfil the praise. Otherwise it must be sung to the usual tunes of the Long Metre. II The Lord! how absolute he reigns! Let ev'ry angel bend the knee; Sing of his love in heavenly strains, And speak how fierce his terrors be. III High on a throne his glories dwell, An awful throne of shining bliss: Fly thro' the world O sun, and tell How dark thy beams compar'd to his. IV Awake, ye tempests, and his fame In sounds of dreadful praise declare; And the sweet wisper of his name Fill every gentler breeze of air. V Let clouds, and winds, and waves agree To join their praise with blazing fire; Let the firm earth, and rolling sea, In this eternal song conspire. VI Ye flowery plains, proclaim his skill; Vallies, lie low before his eye; And let his praise from every hill Rise tuneful to the neighbouring sky. VII Ye stubborn oaks, and stately pines, Bend your high branches and adore: Praise him, ye beasts, in different strains; The lamb must bleat, the lion roar. VIII Birds, ye must make his praise your theme, Nature demands a song from you: While the dumb fish that cut the stream Leap up, and mean his praises too. IX Mortals, can you refrain your tongue, When nature all around you sings? O for a shout from old and young, From humble swains and lofty kings! X Wide as his vast dominion lies Make the Creator's name be known; Loud as his thunder shout his praise, And sound it lofty as his throne. XI Jehovah! 'tis a glorious word, O may it dwell on every tongue! But saints who best have known the Lord Are bound to raise the noblest song. XII Speak of the wonders of that love Which Gabriel plays on every chord: From all below and all above, Loud hallelujahs to the Lord! PSALM 148. (S. M.) Universal Praise. I Let every creature join To praise th'eternal God; Ye heavenly hosts the song begin, And sound his name abroad. II Thou sun with golden beams, And moon with paler rays, Ye starry lights, ye twinkling flames, Shine to your Maker's praise. III He built those worlds above, And fix'd their wondrous frame; By his command they stand or move, And ever speak his name. IV Ye vapours, when ye rise, Or fall in showers, or snow, Ye thunders murm'ring round the skies, His power and glory show. V Wind, hail, and flashing fire, Agree to praise the Lord, When ye in dreadful storms conspire To execute his word. VI By all his works above His honours be exprest; But saints that taste his saving love Should sing his praises best. VII Let earth and ocean know They owe their Maker praise; Praise him, ye watery worlds below, And monsters of the seas. VIII From mountains near the sky Let his high praise resound, From humble shrubs and cedars high, And vales and fields around. IX Ye lions of the wood, And tamer beasts that graze, Ye live upon his daily food And he expects your praise. X Ye birds of lofty wing, On high his praises bear; Or sit on flowery boughs, and sing Your Maker's glory there. XI Ye creeping ants and worms, His various wisdom show, And flies, in all your shining swarms, Praise him that dress'd you so. XII By all the earth-born race His honours be exprest; But saints that know his heavenly grace Should learn to praise him best. XIII Monarchs of wide command, Praise ye th'eternal King; Judges, adore that sovereign hand Whence all your honours spring. XIV Let vigorous youth engage To sound his praises high; While growing babes, and withering age, Their feebler voices try. XV United zeal be shown His wondrous fame to raise: God is the Lord: his name alone Deserves our endless praise. XVI Let nature join with art, And all pronounce him blest; But saints that dwell so near his heart Should sing his praises best. PSALM 149. (C. M.) Praise God, all Saints; or, the Saints judging the World. I All ye that love the Lord, rejoice, And let your songs be new; Amidst the church with cheerful voice His later wonders shew. II The Jews, the people of his grace, Shall their Redeemer sing; And Gentile nations join the praise, While Zion owns her king. III The Lord takes pleasure in the just Whom sinners treat with scorn; The meek that lie despis'd in dust Salvation shall adorn. IV Saints should be joyful in their King, Ev'n on a dying bed; And like the souls in glory sing, For God shall raise the dead. V Then his high praise shall fill their tongues, Their hands shall wield the sword; And vengeance shall attend their songs, The vengeance of the Lord. VI When Christ his judgment-seat ascends, And bids the world appear, Thrones are prepar'd for all his friends, Who humbly lov'd him here. VII Then shall they rule with iron rod Nations that dar'd rebel; And join the sentence of their God On tyrants doom'd to hell. VIII The royal sinners bound in chains New triumphs shall afford; Such honour for the saints remains: Praise ye, and love the Lord. This psalm seems to be written to encourage the Jews in their wars against the heathen princes of Canaan, who were divinely sentenced to destruction: but the last four verses of it have been too much abused in latter ages to promote sedition and disturbance in the state; so that I chose to refer this honour, that is here given to all the saints, to the day of judgment, according to those expressions in the New Testament, Matt. xix. 28. Ye shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the tribes, &amp;c. 1 Cor. vi. 3. We shall judge angels, Rev. ii. 27. and iii. 21. I will give him power over the nations; he shall rule them with a rod of iron, &amp;c. PSALM 150. v. 1, 2, 6. (C. M.) A Song of Praise. I In God's own house pronounce his praise, His grace he there reveals; To heaven your joy and wonder raise, For there his glory dwells. II Let all your sacred passions move, While you rehearse his deeds; But the great work of saving love Your highest praise exceeds. III All that have motion, life, and breath, Proclaim your Maker blest; Yet when my voice expires in death, My soul shall praise him best. The greatest part of this psalm suits not my chief design; I have therefore imitated only the first two verses and the last, in a short Doxology, or song of praise. Yet, since the Christian Doxology is more used in Christian assemblies, I have added that also. THE CHRISTIAN DOXOLOGY. Long Metre. To God the Father, God the Son, And God the Spirit Three in One, Be honour, praise, and glory given, By all on earth, and all in heaven. Common Metre. Let God the Father, and the Son, And Spirit be ador'd, Where there are works to make him known, Or saints to love the Lord. Common Metre. I The God of mercy be ador'd, Who calls our souls from death, Who saves by his redeeming word, And new-creating breath. II To praise the Father and the Son And Spirit all divine, The One in Three, and Three in One, Let saints and angels join. Short Metre. Ye angels round the throne, And saints that dwell below, Worship the Father, praise the Son, And bless the Spirit too. As the 113th Psalm. Now to the great and sacred Three, The Father, Son, and Spirit be Eternal praise and glory given, Thro' all the worlds where God is known, By all the angels near the throne, And all the saints in earth and heaven. As the 148th Psalm. To God the Father's throne Perpetual honours raise; Glory to God the Son, To God the Spirit praise; With all our powers, Eternal King, Thy name we sing, While faith adores. HYMNS AND SPIRITUAL SONGS, IN THREE BOOKS. AND THEY SUNG A NEW SONG, SAYING, THOU ART WORTHY, &amp;C. FOR THOU WAST SLAIN, AND HAST REDEEMED US, &amp;C. REV. V. 9. SOLITI ESSENT (i. e. CHRISTIANI) CONVENIRE, CARMENQUE CHRISTO QUASI DEO DICERE. Plinius in Epist. BOOK I. COLLECTED FROM THE HOLY SCRIPTURES. HYMN 1. (C. M.) A new Song to the Lamb that was slain, Rev. v. 6, 8, 9, 10, 12. I Behold the glories of the Lamb Amidst his Father's throne: Prepare new honours for his name, And songs before unknown. II Let elders worship at his feet, The church adore around, With vials full of odours sweet, And harps of sweeter sound. III Those are the prayers of the saints, And these the hymns they raise: Jesus is kind to our complaints, He loves to hear our praise. IV Eternal Father, who shall look Into thy secret will? Who but the Son should take that book And open every seal? V He shall fulfil thy great decrees, The Son deserves it well; Lo, in his hand the sovereign keys Of heaven, and death, and hell! VI Now to the Lamb that once was slain Be endless blessings paid; Salvation, glory, joy remain For ever on thy head. VII Thou hast redeem'd our souls with blood, Hast set the prisoners free, Hast made us kings and priests to God, And we shall reign with thee. VIII The worlds of nature and of grace Are put beneath thy power; Then shorten these delaying days, And bring the promis'd hour. HYMN 2. (L. M.) The Deity and Humanity of Christ, John i. 1, 3, 14. Col. i. 16. Eph. iii. 9, 10. I Ere the blue heavens was stretch'd abroad From everlasting was the word; With God he was; the word was God, And must divinely be ador'd. II By his own power were all things made; By him supported all things stand; He is the whole creation's head, And angel's fly at his command. III Ere sin was born, or Satan fell, He led the host of morning stars; (Thy generation who can tell, Or count the numbers of the years?) IV But lo, he leaves those heavenly forms, The Word descends and dwells in clay, That he may hold converse with worms, Drest in such feeble flesh as they. V Mortals with joy beheld his face, Th'eternal Father's only Son; How full of truth! how full of grace! When thro' his eyes the Godhead shone! VI Archangels leave their high abode To learn new mysteries here, and tell The loves of our descending God, The glories of Immanuel. HYMN 3. (S. M.) The Nativity of Christ, Luke i. 30, &amp;c. Luke ii. 10. &amp;c. I Behold, the grace appears, The promise is fulfil'd; Mary the wondrous virgin bears, And Jesus is the child. II The Lord, the highest God, Calls him his only Son; He bids him rule the lands abroad, And gives him David's throne. III O'er Jacob shall he reign With a peculiar sway; The nations shall his grace obtain, His kingdom ne'er decay. IV To bring the glorious news A heavenly form appears; He tells the shepherds of their joys, And banishes their fears. V ‘Go, humble swains,’ said he, ‘To David's city fly; ‘The promis'd infant born to-day ‘Doth in a manger lie. VI ‘With looks and hearts serene, ‘Go visit Christ your King;’ And straight a flaming troop was seen; The shepherds heard them sing: VII ‘Glory to God on high, ‘And heavenly peace on earth, ‘Good-will to men, to angels joy, ‘At the Redeemer's birth!’ VIII In worship so divine Let saints employ their tongues, With the celestial host we join, And loud repeat their songs: IX ‘Glory to God on high, ‘And heavenly peace on earth, ‘Good-will to men, to angels joy, ‘At our Redeemer's birth.’ Hymn 4 referred to Psalm 2. HYMN 5. (C. M.) Submission to afflictive Providences, Job. i. 21. I Naked as from the earth we came, And crept to life at first, We to the earth return again, And mingle with our dust. II The dear delights we here enjoy, And fondly call our own, Are but short favours borrow'd now, To be repaid anon. III 'Tis God that lifts our comforts high, Or sinks them in the grave; He gives, and (blessed be his name!) He takes but what he gave. IV Peace, all our angry passions, then, Let each rebellious sigh Be silent at his sovereign will, And every murmur die. V If smiling mercy crown our lives Its praises shall be spread, And we'll adore the justice too That strikes our comforts dead. HYMN 6. (C. M.) Triumph over Death, Job. xix. 25–27. I Great God, I own thy sentence just, And nature must decay; I yield my body to the dust To dwell with fellow-clay. II Yet faith may triumph o'er the grave, And trample on the tombs: My Jesus, my Redeemer lives, My God, my Saviour comes. III The mighty conqueror shall appear High on a royal seat, And death the last of all his foes Lie vanquish'd at his feet. IV Tho' greedy worms devour my skin, And gnaw my wasting flesh, When God shall build my bones again, He clothes them all afresh. V Then shall I see thy lovely face With strong immortal eyes, And feast upon thy unknown grace With pleasure and surprise. HYMN 7. (C. M.) The Invitation of the Gospel; or, Spiritual Food and Clothing, Isaiah lv. 1, &amp;c. I Let every mortal ear attend, And every heart rejoice, The trumpet of the gospel sounds With an inviting voice. II Ho, all ye hungry starving souls, That feed upon the wind, And vainly strive with earthly toys To fill an empty mind. III Eternal Wisdom has prepar'd A soul-reviving feast, And bids your longing appetites The rich provision taste. IV Ho, ye that pant for living streams, And pine away and die, Here you may quench your raging thirst With springs that never dry. V Rivers of love and mercy here In a rich ocean join; Salvation in abundance flows, Like floods of milk and wine. VI Ye perishing and naked poor, Who work with mighty pain To weave a garment of your own That will not hide your sin, VII Come naked, and adorn your souls In robes prepar'd by God, Wrought by the labours of his Son, And dy'd in his own blood. VIII Dear God, the treasures of thy love Are everlasting mines, Deep as our helpless miseries are, And boundless as our sins. IX The happy gates of gospel grace Stand open night and day, Lord we are come to seek supplies, And drive our wants away. HYMN 8. (C. M.) The Safety and Protection of the Church, Isaiah xxvi. 1–6. I How honourable is the place Where we adoring stand, Zion the glory of the earth, And beauty of the land! II Bulwarks of mighty grace defend The city where we dwell, The walls of strong salvation made, Defy th'assaults of hell. III Lift up the everlasting gates, The doors wide open fling, Enter, ye nations, that obey The statutes of our king. IV Here shall you taste unmingled joys, And live in perfect peace, You that have known Jehovah's name, And ventur'd on his grace; V Trust in the Lord, for ever trust, And banish all your fears; Strength in the Lord Jehovah dwells, Eternal as his years. VI What though the rebels dwell on high, His arm shall bring them low, Low as the caverns of the grave Their lofty heads shall bow. VII On Babylon our feet shall tread In that rejoicing hour, The ruins of her walls shall spread A pavement for the poor. HYMN 9. (C. M.) The Promises of the Covenant of Grace, Isaiah lv. 1, 2. Zech. xiii. 1. Mic. vii. 19. Ezek. xxxvi. 25, &amp;c. I In vain we lavish out our lives To gather empty wind, The choisest blessings earth can yield Will starve a hungry mind. II Come, and the Lord shall feed our souls With more substantial meat, With such as saints in glory love, With such as angels eat. III Our God will every want supply, And fill our hearts with peace; He gives by covenant and by oath The riches of his grace. IV Come, and he'll cleanse our spotted souls, And wash away our stains, In the dear fountain that his Son Pour'd from his dying veins. V Our guilt shall vanish all away Tho' black as hell before; Our sins shall sink beneath the sea, And shall be found no more. VI And lest pollution should o'erspread Our inward powers again, His spirits shall bedew our souls Like purifying rain. VII Our heart, that flinty stubborn thing, That terrors cannot move, That fears no threatenings of his wrath, Shall be dissolv'd by love. VIII Or he can take the flint away That would not be refin'd, And from the treasures of his grace Bestow a softer mind. XI There shall his sacred spirit dwell, And deep engrave his law, And every motion of our souls To swift obedience draw. X Thus will he pour salvation down, And we shall render praise, We the dear people of his love, And he our God of grace. HYMN 10. (S. M.) The Blessedness of Gospel Times; or, the Revelation of Christ to Jews and Gentiles, Isaiah v. 2, 7–10. Matt. xiii. 16, 17. I How beauteous are their feet Who stand on Zion's hill! Who bring salvation on their tongues, And words of peace reveal! II How charming is their voice! How sweet the tidings are! ‘Zion, behold thy Saviour King, ‘He reigns and triumphs here.’ III How happy are our ears That hear this joyful sound Which kings and prophets waited for, And sought, but never found! IV How blessed are our eyes That see this heavenly light! Prophets and kings desired it long But dy'd without the sight. V The watchmen join their voice, And tuneful notes employ; Jerusalem breaks forth in songs, And deserts learn the joy. VI The Lord makes bare his arm Thro' all the earth abroad; Let every nation now behold Their Saviour and their God. HYMN 11. (L. M.) The Humble enlightened, and carnal Reason humbled; or, the Sovereignty of Grace, Luke x. 21, 22. I There was an hour when Christ rejoic'd, And spoke his joy in words of praise; ‘Father, I thank thee, mighty God, ‘Lord of the earth, and heavens, and seas. II ‘I thank thy sovereign power and love, ‘That crowns my doctrine with success; ‘And makes the babes in knowledge learn ‘The heights, and breadths, and lengths of grace. III ‘But all this glory lies conceal'd ‘From men of prudence and of wit; ‘The prince of darkness blinds their eyes, ‘And their own pride resists the light. IV ‘Father, 'tis thus, because thy will ‘Chose and ordain'd it should be so; ‘'Tis thy delight t'abase the proud, ‘And lay the haughty scorner low. V ‘There's none can know the Father right ‘But those who learn it from the Son; ‘Nor can the Son be well receiv'd ‘But where the Father makes him known.’ VI Then let our souls adore our God That deals his graces as he please, Nor gives to mortals an account Or of his actions, or decrees. HYMN 12. (C. M.) Free Grace in revealing Christ, Luke x. 21. I Jesus, the man of constant grief, A mourner all his days; His spirit once rejoic'd aloud, And tun'd his joy to praise. II ‘Father, I thank thy wondrous love, ‘That hath reveal'd thy Son ‘To men unlearned; and to babes ‘Has made thy gospel known. III ‘The mysteries of redeeming grace ‘Are hidden from the wise, ‘While pride and carnal reasonings join ‘To swell and blind their eyes.’ IV Thus doth the Lord of heaven and earth His great decrees fulfil, And orders all his works of grace By his own sovereign will. HYMN 13. (L. M.) The Son of God incarnate; or, the Titles and the Kingdom of Christ, Isaiah ix. 2, 6, 7. I The lands that long in darkness lay Now have beheld a heavenly light; Nations that sat in death's cold shade Are blest with beams divinely bright. II The virgin's promis'd Son is born, Behold the expected child appear; What shall his names or titles be? The Wonderful, the Counsellor. III This infant is the mighty God Come to be suckled and ador'd; Th'eternal Father, Prince of Peace, The Son of David, and his Lord. IV The government of earth and seas Upon his shoulders shall be laid; His wide dominions still increase, And honours to his name be paid. V Jesus the holy child shall sit High on his father David's throne, Shall crush his foes beneath his feet, And reign to ages yet unknown. HYMN 14. (L. M.) The Triumph of Faith; or, Christ's unchangeable Love, Romans viii. 33, &amp;c. I Who shall the Lord's elect condemn? 'Tis God that justifies their souls, And mercy like a mighty stream O'er all their sins divinely rolls. II Who shall adjudge the saints to hell? 'Tis Christ that suffer'd in their stead, And the salvation to fulfil, Behold him rising from the dead. III He lives, he lives, and sits above, For ever interceding there: Who shall divde us from his love? Or what should tempt us to despair? IV Shall persecution, or distress, Famine, or sword, or nakedness? He that hath lov'd us bears us thro'. And makes us more than conquerors too. V Faith hath an overcoming power, It triumphs in the dying hour; Christ is our life, our joy, our hope, Nor can we sink with such a prop. VI Not all that men on earth can do, Nor powers on high, nor powers below, Shall cause his mercy to remove, Or wean our hearts from Christ our love. HYMN 15. (L. M.) Our own Weakness, and Christ our Strength, 2 Cor. xii. 7, 9, 10. I Let me but hear my Saviour say, ‘Strength shall be equal to thy day,’ Then I rejoice in deep distress, Leaning on all-sufficient grace. II I glory in infirmity, That Christ's own power may rest on me; When I am weak, then am I strong, Grace is my shield, and Christ my song. III I can do all things, or can bear All sufferings, if my Lord be there; Sweet pleasures mingle with the pains, While his left hand my head sustains. IV But if the Lord be once withdrawn, And we attempt the work alone, When new temptations spring and rise We find how great our weakness is. V So Samson, when his hair was lost, Met the Philistines to his cost, Shook his vain limbs with sad surprise, Made feeble fight, and lost his eyes. HYMN 16. (C. M.) Hosanna to Christ, Matt. xxi. 9. Luke xix. 38, 40. I Hosanna to the royal Son Of David's ancient line, His natures two, his person one, Mysterious and divine. II The root of David here we find, And offspring is the same; Eternity and time are join'd In our Immanuel's name. III Bless'd he that comes to wretched men With peaceful news from heaven; Hosannas of the highest strain To Christ the Lord be given. VI Let mortals ne'er refuse to take Th'hosanna on their tongues, Lest rocks and stones should rise, and break Their silence into songs. HYMN 17. (C. M.) Victory over Death, 1 Cor. xv. 55, &amp;c. I O for an overcoming faith To cheer my dying hours, To triumph o'er the monster death, And all his frightful powers! II Joyful with all the strength I have My quivering lips should sing, ‘Where is thy boasted victory, grave? ‘And where the monster's sting?’ III If sin be pardon'd I'm secure, Death hath no sting beside; The law give sin its damning power, But Christ my ransom dy'd. IV Now to the God of victory Immortal thanks be paid, Who makes us conquerors while we die, Thro' Christ our living head. HYMN 18. (C. M.) Blessed are the Dead that die in the Lord, Rev. xiv. 13. I Hear what the voice from heaven proclaims, For all the pious dead, Sweet is the savour of their names, And soft their sleeping bed. II They die in Jesus and are bless'd; How kind their slumbers are! From sufferings and from sins releas'd, And freed from every snare. III Far from this world of toil and strife, They're present with the Lord; The labours of their mortal life End in a large reward. HYMN 19. (C. M.) The Song of Simeon; or, Death made desirable, Luke ii. 27, &amp;c. I Lord, at thy temple we appear, As happy Simeon came, And hope to meet our Saviour here; O make our joys the same! II With what divine and vast delight The good old man was fill'd, When fondly in his wither'd arms He clasp'd the holy child! III ‘Now I can leave this world,’ he cry'd, ‘Behold thy servant dies, ‘I've seen thy great salvation, Lord, ‘And close my peaceful eyes. IV ‘This is the light prepar'd to shine ‘Upon the gentile lands, ‘Thine Israel's glory, and their hope ‘To break their slavish bands.’ V Jesus, the vision of thy face Hath overpowering charms, Scarce shall I feel death's cold embrace If Christ be in my arms. VI Then while ye hear my heart-strings break, How sweet my minutes roll! A mortal paleness on my cheek, And glory in my soul. HYMN 20. (C. M.) Spiritual Apparel; namely, the Robe of Righteousness, and Garments of Salvation, Isaiah lxi. 10. I Awake, my heart, arise, my tongue, Prepare a tuneful voice, In God, the life of all my joys, Aloud will I rejoice. II 'Tis he adorn'd my naked soul, And made salvation mine, Upon a poor polluted worm He makes his graces shine. III And lest the shadow of a spot Should on my soul be found, He took the robe the Saviour wrought, And cast it all around. IV How far the heavenly robe exceeds What earthly princes wear! These ornaments how bright they shine! How white the garments are! V The Spirit wrought my faith and love, And hope, and every grace; But Jesus spent his life to work The robe of righteousness. VI Strangely, my soul, art thou array'd By the great Sacred Three: In sweetest harmony of praise Let all thy powers agree. HYMN 21. (C. M.) A Vision of the Kingdom of Christ among Men, Rev. xxi. 1–4. I Lo, what a glorious sight appears To our believing eyes! The earth and sea are past away, And the old rolling skies. II From the third heaven where God resides, That holy happy place, The New Jerusalem comes down Adorn'd with shining grace. III Attending angels shout for joy, And the bright armies sing, ‘Mortals, behold the sacred seat ‘Of your descending king. IV ‘The God of glory down to men ‘Removes his blest abode, ‘Men the dear objects of his grace, ‘And he the loving God. V ‘His own soft hand shall wipe the tears ‘From every weeping eye, ‘And pains, and groans, and griefs, and fears, ‘And death itself shall die.’ VI How long, dear Saviour, O how long, Shall this bright hour delay! Fly swifter round, ye wheels of time, And bring the welcome day. Hymn 22 and 23 referred to Psalm 125. HYMN 24. (L. M.) The rich Sinner dying, Psalm xlix. 6, 9. Eccles. viii. 8. Job iii. 14, 15. I In vain the wealthy mortals toil, And heap their shining dust in vain, Look down and scorn the humble poor, And boast their lofty hills of gain. II Their golden cordials cannot ease Their pained hearts or aching heads, Nor fright nor bribe approaching death From glittering roofs and downy beds. III The lingering, the unwilling soul The dismal summons must obey, And bid a long a sad farwel To the pale lump of lifeless clay. IV Thence they are huddled to the grave, Where kings and slaves have equal thrones; Their bones without distinction lie Amongst the heap of meaner bones. The rest referred to Psalm 49. HYMN 25. (L. M.) A Vision of the Lamb, Rev. v. 6–9. I All mortal vanities, begone, Nor tempt my eyes, nor tire my ears, Behold amidst th'eternal throne A vision of the Lamb appears. II Glory his fleecy robe adorns, Mark'd with the bloody death he bore; Seven are his eyes, and seven his horns, To speak his wisdom and his power. III Lo, he receives a sealed book From him that sits upon the throne Jesus, my Lord, prevails to look On dark decrees, and things unknown. IV All the assembling saints around Fall worshipping before Lamb And in new songs of gospel-sound Address their honours to his name. V The joy, the shout, the harmony Flies o'er the everlasting hills, ‘Worthy art thou alone,’ they cry, ‘To read the book, to loose the seals.’ VI Our voices join the heavenly strain, And with transporting pleasure sing, ‘Worthy the Lamb that once was slain, ‘To be our teacher and our king!’ VII His words of prophecy reveal Eternal counsels, deep designs; His grace and vengeance shall fulfil The peaceful and the dreadful lines. VIII Thou hast redeem'd our souls from hell With thine invaluable blood; And wretches that did once rebel Are now made favourites of their God. IX Worthy for ever is the Lord, That dy'd for treasons not his own, By every tongue to be ador'd, And dwell upon his Father's throne. HYMN 26. (C. M.) Hope of Heaven by the Resurrection of Christ, 1 Pet. 3–5. I Bless'd be the everlasting God, The Father of our Lord, Be his abounding mercy prais'd, His majesty ador'd. II When from the dead he rais'd his Son, And call'd him to the sky, He gave our souls a lively hope That they should never die. III What tho' our inbred sins require Our flesh to see the dust! Yet as the Lord our Saviour rose So all his followers must. IV There's an inheritance divine Reserv'd against that day, 'Tis uncorrupted, undefil'd, And cannot waste away. V Saints by the power of God are kept Till the salvation come; We walk by faith as strangers here Till Christ shall call us home. HYMN 27. (C. M.) Assurance of Heaven; or, a Saint prepared to die, 2 Tim. iv. 6–8. 1. I Death may dissolve my body now, And bear my spirit home; Why do my minutes move so slow, Nor my salvation come? II With heavenly weapons I have fought The battles of the Lord, Finish'd my course, and kept the faith, And wait the sure reward. III God has laid up in heaven for me A crown which cannot fade; The righteous Judge at that great day Shall place it on my head. IV Nor hath the King of grace decreed This prize for me alone; But all that love and long to see Th'appearance of his Son. V Jesus, the Lord, shall guard me safe From every ill design; And to his heavenly kingdom keep This feeble soul of mine. VI God is my everlasting aid, And hell shall rage in vain; To him be highest glory paid, And endless praise—Amen. HYMN 28. (C. M.) The Triumph of Christ over the Enemies of his Church, Isaiah lxiii. 1–3, &amp;c. I What mighty man, or mighty God, Comes travelling in state, Along the Idumean road Away from Bozrah's gate? II The glory of his robes proclaim 'Tis some victorious king: ‘'Tis I, the Just, th'Almighty One, ‘That your salvation bring.’ III ‘Why, mighty Lord,’ thy saints enquire, ‘Why thine apparel red? ‘And all thy vesture stain'd like those ‘Who in the wine-press tread?’ IV ‘I by myself have trod the press, ‘And crush'd my foes alone, ‘My wrath hath struck the rebels dead, ‘My fury stamp'd them down. V ‘'Tis Edom's blood that dyes my robes ‘With joyful scarlet stains, ‘The triumph that my raiment wears ‘Sprung from their bleeding veins. VI ‘Thus shall the nations be destroy'd ‘That dare insult my saints, ‘I have an arm t'avenge their wrongs ‘An ear for their complaints.’ HYMN 29. (C. M.) The Ruin of Antichrist, Isaiah lxiii. 4–7. I ‘I lift my banners,’ saith the Lord, ‘Where Antichrist has stood, ‘The city of my gospel-foes ‘Shall be a field of blood. II ‘My heart has study'd just revenge, ‘And now the day appears, ‘The day of my redeem'd is come ‘To wipe away their tears. III ‘Quite weary is my patience grown, ‘And bids my fury go; ‘Swift as the light'ning it shall move ‘And be as fatal too. IV ‘I call for helpers but in vain: ‘Then has my gospel none? ‘Well, mine own arm has might enough ‘To crush my foes alone. V ‘Slaughter and my devouring sword, ‘Shall walk the streets around, ‘Babel shall reel beneath my stroke, ‘And stagger to the ground.’ VII Thy honours, O victorious King! Thine own right hand shall raise, While we thy awful vengeance sing, And our Deliverer praise. HYMN 30. (L. M.) Prayer for Deliverance answered, Isaiah xxvi. 8–12, 20, 21. I In thine own ways, O God of love, We wait the visits of thy grace, Our souls desire is to thy name, And the remembrance of thy face. II My thoughts are searching, Lord, for thee, 'Mongst the black shades of lonesome night; My earnest cries salute the skies Before the dawn restore the light. III Look, how rebellious men deride The tender patience of my God; But they shall see thy lifted hand, And feel the scourges of thy rod. IV Hark, th'eternal rends the sky A mighty voice before him goes, A voice of music to his friends, But threatening thunder to his foes. V Come, children, to your father's arms, Hide in the chambers of my grace, Till the fierce storms be overblown, And my revenging fury cease. VI My sword shall boast its thousands slain, And drink the blood of haughty kings, While heavenly peace around my flock Stretches its soft and shady wings. Hymn 31 referred to Psalm 1. HYMN 32. (C. M.) Strength from Heaven, Isaiah xl. 27–30. I Whence do our mournful thoughts arise? And where's our courage fled? Has restless sin and raging hell Struck all our comforts dead? II Have we forgot th'Almighty name That form'd the earth and sea? And can an all-creating arm Grow weary or decay? III Treasures of everlasting might In our Jehovah dwell; He gives the conquest to the weak, And treads their foes to hell. IV Mere mortal power shall fade and die, And youthful vigour cease; But we that wait upon the Lord Shall feel our strength increase. V The saints shall mount on eagles' wings, And taste the promis'd bliss, Till their unwearied feet arrive Where perfect pleasure is. Hymns 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, referred to Psalms 131, 134, 67, 73, 90, 84. HYMN 39. (C. M.) God's tender Care of his Church, Isaiah xlix. 13, &amp;c. I Now shall my inward joys arise And burst into a song, Almighty love inspires my heart, And pleasure tunes my tongue. II God on his thirsty Sion-hill Some mercy-drops has thrown, And solemn oaths have bound his love To shower salvation down. III Why do we then indulge our fears, Suspicions and complaints? Is he a God, and shall his grace Grow weary of his saints? IV Can a kind woman e'er forget The infant of her womb, And 'mongst a thousand tender thoughts Her suckling have no room? V ‘Yet,’ saith the Lord, ‘should nature change, ‘And mothers monsters prove, ‘Sion still dwells upon the heart ‘Of everlasting Love. VI ‘Deep on the palms of both my hands ‘I have engrav'd her name, ‘My hands shall raise her ruin'd walls, ‘And build her broken frame.’ HYMN 40. (L. M.) The Business and Blessedness of glorified Saints, Rev. vii. 13, &amp;c. I ‘What happy men, or angels, these ‘That all their robes are spotless white? ‘Whence did this glorious troop arrive ‘At the pure realms of heavenly light?’ II From tort'ring racks and burning fires, And seas of their own blood they came; But nobler blood has wash'd their robes, Flowing from Christ the dying Lamb. III Now they approach th'Almighty throne, With loud hosannas night and day, Sweet anthems to the great Three One Measure their blest eternity. IV No more shall hunger pain their souls, He bids their parching thirst be gone, And spreads the shadow of his wings To screen them from the scorching sun. V The Lamb that fills the middle throne Shall shed around his milder beams, There shall they feast on his rich love, And drink full joys from living streams. VI Thus shall their mighty bliss renew Thro' the vast round of endless years, And the soft hand of sovereign grace Heals all their wounds, and wipes their tears. HYMN 41. (L. M.) The same; or, the Martyrs glorified, Rev. vii. 13, &amp;c. I ‘These glorious minds, how bright they shine! ‘Whence all their white array? ‘How came they to the happy seats ‘Of everlasting day?’ II From tort'ring pains to endless joys On fiery wheels they rode, And strangely wash'd their raiment white In Jesus' dying blood. III Now they approach a spotless God, And bow before his throne; Their warbling harps and sacred songs Adore the Holy One. IV The unveil'd glories of his face Amongst his saints reside, While the rich treasure of his grace Sees all their wants supply'd. V Tormenting thirst shall leave their souls, And hunger flee as fast; The fruit of life's immortal tree Shall be their sweet repast. VI The Lamb shall lead his heavenly flock Where living fountains rise, And Love divine shall wipe away The sorrows of their eyes. HYMN 42. (C. M.) Divine Wrath and Mercy, Nahum i. 2, &amp;c. I Adore and tremble, for our God Is a consuming fire; Heb. xii. 29. His jealous eyes his wrath inflame, And raise his vengeance higher. II Almighty vengeance how it burns! How bright his fury glows! Vast magazines of plagues and storms Lie treasur'd for his foes. III Those heaps of wrath by slow degrees Are forc'd into a flame, But kindled, O how fierce they blaze! And rend all nature's frame. IV At his approach the mountains flee, And seek a watery grave: The frighted sea makes haste away, And shrinks up every wave. V Thro' the wide air the weighty rocks Are swift as hail-stones hurl'd: Who dares engage his fiery rage That shakes the solid world? VI Yet, mighty God, thy sovereign grace Sits regent on the throne, The refuge of thy chosen race When wrath comes rushing down. VII Thy hand shall on rebellious kings A fiery tempest pour, While we beneath thy sheltering wings Thy just revenge adore. Hymns 43 and 44, referred to Psalms 100 and 133. HYMN 45. (C. M.) The Last Judgment, Rev. xxi. 5–8. I See where the great incarnate God Fills a majestic throne, While from the skies his awful voice Bears the last judgment down. II ‘I am the first, and I the last, ‘Thro' endless years the same; ‘I AM is my memorial still, ‘And my eternal name. III ‘Such favours as a God can give ‘My royal grace bestows; ‘Ye thirsty souls, come taste the streams ‘Where life and pleasure flows. IV ‘The saint that triumphs o'er his sins, ‘I'll own him for a son, ‘The whole creation shall reward ‘The conquest he has won. V ‘But bloody hands and hearts unclean, ‘And all the lying race, ‘The faithless and the scoffing crew, ‘That spurn at offer'd grace; VI ‘They shall be taken from my sight, ‘Bound fast in iron chains, ‘And headlong plung'd into the lake ‘Where fire and darkness reigns.’ VII O may I stand before the Lamb, When earth and seas are fled! And hear the Judge pronounce my name With blessings on my head! VIII May I with those for ever dwell Who here were my delight, While sinners banish'd down to hell No more offend my sight. Hymns 46 and 47, referred to Psalms 148, and 3. HYMN 48. (L. M.) The Christian Race, Isaiah xl. 28–31. I Awake, our souls, away, our fears, Let every trembling thought be gone; Awake and run the heavenly race, And put a cheerful courage on. II True, 'tis a strait and thorny road, And mortal spirits tire and faint; But they forget the mighty God That feeds the strength of every saint— III Thee, mighty God, whose matchless power Is ever new and ever young, And firm endures while endless years Their everlasting circles run. IV From thee the overflowing spring, Our souls shall drink a fresh supply, While such as trust their native strength Shall melt away, and drop and die. V Swift as an eagle cuts the air We'll mount aloft to thine abode, On wings of love our souls shall fly, Nor tire amidst the heavenly road. HYMN 49. (C. M.) The Works of Moses and the Lamb, Rev. xv. 3. I How strong thine arm is, mighty God, Who would not fear thy name! Jesus, how sweet thy graces are! Who would not love the Lamb! II He has done more than Moses did, Our Prophet and our King; From bonds of hell he freed our souls And taught our lips to sing. III In the Red Sea by Moses' hand Th'Egyptian host was drown'd; But his own blood hides all our sins, And guilt no more is found. IV When thro' the desert Israel went, With manna they were fed; Our Lord invites us to his flesh, And calls it living bread. V Moses beheld the promis'd land, Yet never reach'd the place; But Christ shall bring his followers home To see his Father's face. VI Then shall our love and joy be full, And feel a warmer flame, And sweeter voices tune the song Of Moses and the Lamb. HYMN 50. (C. M.) The Song of Zacharias, and the Message of John the Baptist; or, Light and Salvation by Jesus Christ, Luke i. 68, &amp;c. John i. 29, 32. I Now be the God of Israel bless'd Who makes his truth appear, His mighty hand fulfils his word, And all the oaths he sware. II Now he bedews old David's root With blessings from the skies; He makes the branch of promise grow, The promis'd Horn arise. III John was the prophet of the Lord To go before his face, The herald which our Saviour God Sent to prepare his ways. IV He makes the great salvation known, He speaks of pardon'd sins; While grace divine and heavenly love In its own glory shines. V ‘Behold the Lamb of God, (he cries) ‘That takes our guilt away: ‘I saw the Spirit o'er his head On his baptising day. VI ‘Be ev'ry vale exalted high, ‘Sink every mountain low, ‘The proud must stoop, and humble souls ‘Shall his salvation know. VII ‘The heathen realms with Israel's land ‘Shall join in sweet accord; ‘And all that's born of man shall see ‘The glory of the Lord. VIII ‘Behold the morning star arise, ‘Ye that in darkness sit: ‘He marks the path that leads to peace, ‘And guides our doubtful feet.’ HYMN 51. (S. M.) Preserving Grace, Jude ver 24, 25. I To God the only wise, Our Saviour and our King, Let all the saints below the skies Their humble praises bring. II 'Tis his almighty love, His counsel, and his care, Preserves us safe from sin and death, And every hurtful snare. III He will present our souls Unblemish'd and complete, Before the glory of his face, With joys divinely great. IV Then all the chosen seed Shall meet around the throne, Shall bless the conduct of his grace, And make his wonders known. V To our Redeemer God Wisdom and power belongs, Immortal crowns of majesty, And everlasting songs. HYMN 52. (C. M.) Baptism, Matt. xxviii. 19. Acts ii. 38. I 'Twas the commission of our Lord, ‘Go, teach the nations, and baptize;’ The nations have receiv'd the word Since he ascended to the skies. II He sits upon th'eternal hills, With grace and pardon in his hands, And sends his covenant with the seals, To bless the distant British lands. III ‘Repent, and be baptiz'd, (he saith) ‘For the remission of your sins;’ And thus our sense assists our faith, And shews us what his gospel means. IV Our souls he washes in his blood, As water makes the body clean; And the good Spirit from our God Descends like purifying rain. V Thus we engage ourselves to thee, And seal our covenant with the Lord: O may the great eternal Three In heaven our solemn vows record! HYMN 53. (L. M.) The Holy Scriptures, Heb. i. 1, 2. 2 Tim. iii. 15, 16. Psalm cxlvii. 19, 20. I God who in various methods told His mind and will to saints of old Sent down his Son, with truth and grace, To teach us in these latter days. II Our nation reads the written word, That book of life, that sure record: The bright inheritance of heaven Is by thy sweet conveyance given. III God's kindest thoughts are here express'd, Able to make us wise and bless'd; The doctrines are divinely true, Fit for reproof and comfort too. IV Ye British isles, who read his love In long epistles from above, (He hath not sent his sacred word To every land) Praise ye the Lord. HYMN 54. (L. M.) Electing Grace; or, Saints beloved in Christ, Eph. i. 3, &amp;c. I Jesus, we bless thy Father's name; Thy God and ours are both the same: What heavenly blessings from his throne Flow down to sinners thro' his Son! II ‘Christ be my first elect,’ he said, Then chose our souls in Christ our head, Before he gave the mountains birth, Or laid foundations for the earth. III Thus did eternal Love begin To raise us up from death and sin: Our characters were then decreed, ‘Blameless in love, a holy seed.’ IV Predestinated to be sons, Born by degrees, but chose at once; A new regenerated race To praise the glory of his grace. V With Christ our Lord we share our part In the affections of his heart, Nor shall our souls be thence remov'd Till he forgets his first belov'd. HYMN 55. (C. M.) Hezekiah's Song; or, Sickness and Recovery, Isaiah xxxviii. 9, &amp;c. I When we are rais'd from deep distress Our God deserves a song; We take the pattern of our praise From Hezekiah's tongue. II The gates of the devouring grave Are open'd wide in vain, If he that holds the keys of death Commands them fast again. III Pains of the flesh are wont t'abuse Our minds with slavish fears; ‘Our days are past, and we shall lose ‘The remnant of our years.’ IV We chatter with a swallow's voice, Or like a dove we mourn, With bitterness instead of joys, Afflicted and forlorn. V Jehovah speaks the healing word, And no disease withstands; Fevers and plagues obey the Lord, And fly at his commands. VI If half the strings of life should break, He can our frame restore; He casts our sins behind his back, And they are found no more. HYMN 56. (C. M.) The Song of Moses and the Lamb; or, Babylon falling, Rev. xv. 3. xvi. 19. xvii. 6. I We sing the glories of thy love, We sound thy dreadful name; The Christian Church unites the songs Of Moses and the Lamb. II Great God, how wondrous are thy works Of vengeance and of grace! Thou King of saints, Almighty Lord, How just and true thy ways! III Who dares refuse to fear thy name, Or worship at thy throne? Thy judgments speak thine holiness Thro' all the nations known. IV Great Babylon, that rules the earth, Drunk with the martyrs blood, Her crimes shall speedily awake The fury of our God. V The cup of wrath is ready mix'd, And she must drink the dregs; Strong is the Lord her sovereign judge, And shall fulfil the plagues. HYMN 57. (C. M.) Original Sin; or, the First and Second Adam, Rom. v. 12. Psalm li. 5. Job xiv. 4. I Backward with humble shame we look On our original; How is our nature dash'd and broke In our first father's fall! II To all that's good averse and blind, But prone to all that's ill: What dreadful darkness veils our mind! How obstinate our will. III Conceiv'd in sin (O wretched state!) Before we draw our breath, The first young pulse begins to beat Iniquity and death. IV How strong in our degenerate blood The old corruption reigns, And mingling with the crooked flood, Wanders thro' all our veins! V Wild and unwholesome as the root Will all the branches be; How can we hope for living fruit From such a deadly tree? VI What mortal power from things unclean Can pure productions bring? Who can command a vital stream From an infected spring? VII Yet, mighty God, thy wondrous love Can make our nature clean, While Christ and grace prevail above The tempter, death, and sin. VIII The second Adam shall restore The ruins of the first, Hosanna to that sovereign power That new creates our dust. HYMN 58. (L. M.) The Devil vanquished; or, Michael's War with the Dragon, Rev. xii. 7. I Let mortal tongues attempt to sing The wars of heaven, when Michael stood Chief general of the Eternal King, And fought the battles of our God. II Against the dragon and his host The armies of the Lord prevail; In vain they rage, in vain they boast, Their courage sinks, their weapons fail. III Down to the earth was Satan thrown, Down to the earth his legions fell; Then was the trump of triumph blown, And shook the dreadful deeps of hell. IV Now is the hour of darkness past, Christ hath assum'd his reigning power; Behold the great accuser cast Down from the skies, to rise no more. V 'Twas by thy blood, immortal Lamb, Thine armies trod the tempter down; 'Twas by thy word and powerful name, They gain'd the battle and renown. VI Rejoice, ye heavens; let every star Shine with new glories round the sky; Saints, while ye sing the heavenly war, Raise your Deliverer's name on high. HYMN 59. (L. M.) Babylon fallen, Rev. xviii. 20, 21. I In Gabriel's hand a mighty stone Lies, a fair type of Babylon: ‘Prophets rejoice, and, all ye saints, ‘God shall avenge your long complaints. II He said, and dreadful as he stood, He sunk the mill-stone in the flood: ‘Thus terribly shall Babel fall; ‘Thus, and no more, be found at all.’ HYMN 60. (L. M.) The Virgin Mary's Song; or, the promised Messiah born, Luke i. 46, &amp;c. I Our souls shall magnify the Lord, In God the Saviour we rejoice; While we repeat the virgin's song, May the same spirit tune our voice. II The highest saw her low estate, And mighty things his hand hath done: His overshadowing power and grace Makes her the mother of his Son. III Let every nation call her bless'd, And endless years prolong her fame; But God alone must be ador'd; Holy and reverend is his name. IV To those that fear and trust the Lord His mercy stands for ever sure: From age to age his promise lives, And the performance is secure. V He spake to Abra'm and his seed, ‘In thee shall all the earth be bless'd;’ The memory of that ancient word Lay long in his eternal breast. VI But now no more shall Israel wait, No more the gentiles lie forlorn: Lo, the desire of nations comes, Behold the promis'd seed is born! HYMN 61. (L. M.) Christ our High-Priest and King, and Christ coming to Judgment, Rev. i. 5–7. I Now to the Lord, that makes us know The wonders of his dying love, Be humble honours paid below, And strains of nobler praise above. II 'Twas he that cleans'd our foulest sins, And wash'd us in his richest blood; 'Tis he that makes us priests and kings, And brings us rebels near to God. III To Jesus our atoning Priest, To Jesus our superior King, Be everlasting power confess'd, And every tongue his glory sing. IV Behold, on flying clouds he comes, And every eye shall see him move; Tho' with our sins we pierc'd him once, Then he displays his pardoning love. V The unbelieving world shall wail While we rejoice to see the day: Come, Lord; nor let thy promise fail, Nor let thy chariots long delay. HYMN 62. (C. M.) Christ Jesus, the Lamb of God, worshipped by all the Creation, Rev. v. 11–13. I Come let us join our cheerful songs With angels round the throne; Ten thousand thousand are their tongues But all their joys are one. II ‘Worthy the Lamb that dy'd,’ they cry, ‘To be exalted thus:’ ‘Worthy the Lamb,’ our lips reply, ‘For he was slain for us.’ III Jesus is worthy to receive Honour and power divine; And blessings more than we can give, Be, Lord, for ever thine. IV Let all that dwell above the sky, And air, and earth, and seas, Conspire to lift thy glories high, And speak thine endless praise. V The whole creation join in one To bless the sacred name Of him that sits upon the throne, And to adore the Lamb. HYMN 63. (L. M.) Christ's Humiliation and Exaltation, Rev. v. 12. I What equal honours shall we bring To thee, O Lord our God, the Lamb, When all the notes that angels sing Are far inferior to thy name? II Worthy is he that once was slain, The Prince of Peace that groan'd and dy'd, Worthy to rise, and live, and reign At his Almighty Father's side. III Power and dominion are his due, Who stood comdemn'd at Pilate's bar: Wisdom belongs to Jesus too, Tho' he was charg'd with madness here. IV All riches are his native right, Yet he sustain'd amazing loss: To him ascribe eternal might, Who left his weakness on the cross. V Honour immortal must be paid, Instead of scandal and of scorn: While glory shines around his head, And a bright crown without a thorn. VI Blessings for ever on the Lamb, Who bore the curse for wretched men: Let angels sound his sacred name, And every creature say, Amen. HYMN 64. (S. M.) Adoption 1 John iii. 1, &amp;c. Gal. iv. 6. I Behold what wondrous grace The Father hath bestow'd On sinners of a mortal race, To call them sons of God! II 'Tis no surprising thing That we should be unknown; The jewish world knew not their King, God's everlasting Son. III Nor doth it yet appear How great we must be made; But when we see our Saviour here, We shall be like our head. IV A hope so much divine May trials well endure, May purge our souls from sense and sin, As Christ the Lord is pure. V If in my Father's love I share a filial part, Send down thy Spirit like a dove To rest upon my heart. VI We would no longer lie Like slaves beneath the throne; My faith shall Abba, Father, cry, And thou the kindred own. HYMN 65. (L. M.) The Kingdoms of the World become the Kingdoms of our Lord; or, the Day of Judgment, Rev. xi. 15–18. I Let the seventh angel sound on high, Let shouts be heard thro' all the sky; Kings of the earth, with glad accord Give up your kingdoms to the Lord. II Almighty God, thy power assume, Who wast, and art, and art to come: Jesus, the Lamb, who once was slain, For ever live, for ever reign. III The angry nations fret and roar, That they can slay the saints no more; On wings of vengeance flies our God To pay the long arrears of blood. IV Now must the rising dead appear, Now the decisive sentence hear; Now the dear martyrs of the Lord Receive an infinite reward. HYMN 66. (L. M.) Christ the King at his Table, Sol. Song. i. 2–5, 12, 13, 17. I Let him embrace my soul, and prove Mine interest in his heavenly love: The voice that tells me, ‘Thou art mine,’ Exceeds the blessings of the vine. II On thee th'anointing Spirit came, And spreads the savour of thy name; That oil of gladness and of grace Draws virgin souls to meet thy face. III Jesus, allure me by thy charms, My soul shall fly into thine arms: Our wandering feet thy favours bring To the fair chambers of the king. IV Wonder and pleasure tunes our voice To speak thy praises, and our joys: Our memory keeps this love of thine Beyond the taste of richest wine. V Tho' in ourselves deform'd we are, And black as Kedar's tents appear, Yet when we put thy beauties on, Fair as the courts of Solomon. VI While at his table sits the King, He loves to see us smile and sing; Our graces are our best perfume, And breathe like spikenard round the room. VII As myrrh new-bleeding from the tree, Such is a dying Christ to me; And while he makes my soul his guest, My bosom, Lord, shall be thy rest. VIII No beams of cedar or of fir Can with thy courts on earth compare; And here we wait until thy love Raise us to nobler seats above. HYMN 67. (L. M.) Seeking the Pastures of Christ the Shepherd, Sol. Song. i. 7. I Thou whom my soul admires above All earthly joy, and earthly love, Tell me, dear Shepherd, let me know, Where doth thy sweetest pasture grow? II Where is the shadow of that rock, That from the sun defends thy flock? Fain would I feed among thy sheep, Among them rest, among them sleep. III Why should thy bride appear like one That turns aside to paths unknown? My constant feet would never rove, Would never seek another love. IV The footsteps of thy flock I see; Thy sweetest pastures here they be; A wondrous feast thy love prepares, Bought with thy wounds, and groans, and tears. V His dearest flesh he makes my food, And bids me drink his richest blood; Here to these hills my soul will come Till my beloved lead me home. HYMN 68. (L. M.) The Banquet of Love, Sol. Song ii. 1–4, 6, 7. I Behold the Rose of Sharon here, The Lily which the vallies bear; Behold the Tree of Life, that gives Refreshing fruit and healing leaves. II Amongst the thorns so lilies shine; Amongst wild gourds the noble vine; So in mine eyes my Saviour proves Amidst a thousand meaner loves. III Beneath his cooling shade I sat To shield me from the burning heat; Of heavenly fruit he spreads a feast To feed my eyes and please my taste. IV Kindly he brought me to the place Where stands the banquet of his grace, He saw me faint, and o'er my head The banner of his love he spread. V With living bread and generous wine He cheers this sinking heart of mine; And opening his own heart to me, He shews his thoughts, how kind they be. VI O never let my Lord depart Lie down and rest upon my heart; I charge my sins not once to move, Nor stir, nor wake, nor grieve my love. HYMN 69. (L. M.) Christ appearing to his Church, and seeking her Company, Sol. Song ii. 8–13. I The voice of my beloved sounds Over the rocks and rising grounds, O'er hills of guilt and seas of grief, He leaps, he flies to my relief. II Now thro' the veil of flesh I see With eyes of love he looks at me; Now in the gospel's clearest glass He shews the beauties of his face. III Gently he draws my heart along Both with his beauties and his tongue; ‘Rise,’ saith my Lord, ‘make haste away; ‘No mortal joys are worth thy stay. IV ‘The Jewish wintry state is gone, ‘The mists are fled, the spring comes on, ‘The sacred turtle dove we hear ‘Proclaim the new, the joyful year. V ‘Th'immortal vine of heavenly root ‘Blossoms and buds, and gives her fruit:’ Lo, we are come to taste the wine; Our souls rejoice and bless the vine. VI And when we hear our Jesus say, ‘Rise up, my love, make haste away!’ Our hearts would fain out-fly the wind, And leave all earthly loves behind. HYMN 70. (L. M.) Christ inviting and the Church answering the Invitation, Sol. Song ii. 14, 16, 17. I Hark, the Redeemer from on high Sweetly invites his favourites nigh; From caves of darkness and of doubt, He gently speaks, and calls us out: II ‘My dove who hidest in the rock, ‘Thine heart almost with sorrow broke, ‘Lift up thy face, forget thy fear, ‘And let thy voice delight mine ear. III ‘Thy voice to me sounds ever sweet; ‘My graces in thy countenance meet; ‘Tho' the vain world thy face despise, ‘'Tis bright and comely in mine eyes.’ IV Dear Lord, our thankful heart receives The hope thine invitation gives: To thee our joyful lips shall raise The voice of prayer, and of praise. V I am my love's, and he is mine; Our hearts, our hopes, our passions join: Nor let a motion, nor a word, Nor thought arise to grieve my Lord. VI My soul to pastures fair he leads, Amongst the lilies where he feeds; Amongst the saints (whose robes are white Wash'd in his blood) is his delight. VII Till the day break, and shadows flee, Till the sweet dawning light I see, Thine eyes to me-ward often turn, Nor let my soul in darkness mourn. VIII Be like a hart on mountains green, Leap o'er the hills of fear and sin; Nor guilt nor unbelief divide, My love, my Saviour from my side. HYMN 71. (L. M.) Christ found in the Street, and brought to the Church, Sol. Song iii. 1–5. I Often I seek my Lord by night, Jesus, my love, my soul's delight; With warm desire and restless thought I seek him oft, but find him not. II Then I arise, and search the street Till I my Lord, my Saviour meet; I ask the watchman of the night, ‘Where did you see my soul's delight?’ III Sometimes I find him in my way, Directed by a heavenly ray; I leap for joy to see his face, And hold him fast in mine embrace. IV I bring him to my mother's home, Nor does my Lord refuse to come, To Sion's sacred chambers, where My soul first drew the vital air. V He gives me there his bleeding heart, Pierc'd for my sake with deadly smart; I give my soul to him, and there Our loves their mutual tokens share. VI I charge you all, ye earthly toys, Approach not to disturb my joys; Nor sin nor hell come near my heart, Nor cause my Saviour to depart. HYMN 72. (L. M.) The Coronation of Christ, and Espousals of the Church, Sol. Song iii. 2. I Daughters of Sion, come, behold The crown of honour and of gold, Which the glad church with joys unknown Plac'd on the head of Solomon. II Jesus, thou everlasting King, Accept the tribute which we bring, Accept the well-deserv'd renown, And wear our praises as thy crown. III Let every act of worship be Like our espousals, Lord, to thee; Like the dear hour when from above We first receiv'd thy pledge of love. IV The gladness of that happy day, Our hearts would wish it long to stay, Nor let our faith forsake its hold, Nor comfort sink, nor love grow cold. V Each following minute as it flies, Increase thy praise, improve our joys, Till we are rais'd to sing thy name At the great supper of the Lamb. VI O that the months would roll away, And bring that coronation-day! The king of grace shall fill the throne With all his Father's glories on. HYMN 73. (L. M.) The Churches Beauty in the Eyes of Christ, Sol. Song iv. 1, 10, 11, 7, 9, 8. I Kind is the speech of Christ our Lord, Affection sounds in every word, ‘Lo, thou art fair, my love,’ he cries, ‘Not the young doves have sweeter eyes. II ‘Sweet are thy lips, thy pleasing voice ‘Salutes mine ear with secret joys, ‘No spice so much delights the smell, ‘Nor milk nor honey taste so well. III ‘Thou art all fair, my bride, to me, ‘I will behold no spot in thee.’ What mighty wonders love performs, And puts a comeliness on worms! IV Defil'd and loathsome as we are, He makes us white, and calls us fair; Adorns us with that heavenly dress, His graces, and his righteousness. V ‘My sister and my spouse,’ he cries, ‘Bound to my heart by various ties, ‘Thy powerful love my heart detains ‘In strong delight and pleasing chains.’ VI He calls me from the leopard's den, From this wild world of beasts and men, To Sion where his glories are; Not Lebanon is half so fair. VII Nor dens of prey, nor flowery plains, Nor earthly joys, nor earthly pains Shall hold my feet, or force my stay, When Christ invites my soul away. HYMN 74. (L. M.) The Church the Garden of Christ, Sol. Song iv. 12, 14, 15. and v. 1. I We are a garden wall'd around, Chosen and made peculiar ground; A little spot inclos'd by grace Out of the world's wide wilderness. II Like trees of myrrh and spice we stand Planted by God the Father's hand; And all his springs in Sion flow To make the young plantation grow. III Awake, O heavenly wind, and come, Blow on this garden of perfume; Spirit divine, descend and breathe A gracious gale on plants beneath. IV Make our best spices flow abroad To entertain our Saviour God: And faith, and love, and joy appear, And every grace be active here. V Let my beloved come, and taste His pleasant fruits at his own feast: ‘I come, my spouse, I come,’ he cries, With love and pleasure in his eyes. VI Our Lord into his garden comes, Well pleas'd to smell our poor perfumes, And calls us to a feast divine, Sweeter than honey, milk, or wine. VII ‘Eat of the tree of life, my friends, ‘The blessings that my Father sends; ‘Your taste shall all my dainties prove, ‘And drink abundance of my love.’ VIII Jesus, we will frequent thy board, And sing the bounties of our Lord: But the rich food on which we live Demands more praise than tongues can give. HYMN 75. (L. M.) The Description of Christ the Beloved, Sol. Song v. 9–12, 14–16. I The wondering world inquires to know Why I should love my Jesus so: ‘What are his charms,’ say they, ‘above ‘The objects of a mortal love?’ II Yes, my beloved, to my sight, Shews a sweet mixture, red and white: All human beauties, all divine In my beloved meet and shine. III White is his soul, from blemish free; Red with the blood he shed for me; The fairest of ten thousand fairs: A sun amongst ten thousand stars. IV His head the finest gold excels, There wisdom in perfection dwells; And glory like a crown adorns Those temples once beset with thorns. V Compassions in his heart are found, Hard by the signals of his wound; His sacred side no more shall bear The cruel scourge, the piercing spear. VI His hands are fairer to behold Than diamonds set in rings of gold; Those heavenly hands that on the tree Were nail'd, and torn, and bled for me. VII Tho' once he bow'd his feeble knees, Loaded with sins and agonies, Now on the throne of his command His legs like marble pillars stand. VIII His eyes are majesty and love, The eagle temper'd with the dove: No more shall trickling sorrows roll Thro' those dear windows of his soul. IX His mouth, that pour'd out long complaints, Now smiles and cheers his fainting saints: His countenance more graceful is Than Lebanon with all its trees. X All over glorious is my Lord, Must be belov'd, and yet ador'd: His worth if all the nations knew, Sure the whole earth would love him too. HYMN 76. (L. M.) Christ dwells in Heaven, but visits on Earth, Sol. Song vi. 1–3, 12. I When strangers stand and hear me tell What beauties in my Saviour dwell; Where he is gone, they fain would know, That they may seek and love him too. II My best beloved keeps his throne On hills of light, in worlds unknown; But he descends, and shows his face In the young gardens of his grace. III In vineyards planted by his hand, Where fruitful trees in order stand; He feeds among the spicy beds, Where lilies show their spotless heads. IV He has engross'd my warmest love, No earthly charms my soul can move: I have a mansion in his heart, Nor death nor hell shall make us part. V He takes my soul e'er I'm aware, And shows me where his glories are; No chariot of Amminadib The heavenly rapture can describe. VI O may my spirit daily rise On wings of faith above the skies, Till death shall make my last remove To dwell for ever with my love. HYMN 77. (L. M.) The Love of Christ to the Church, in his Language to her, and Provisions for her, Sol. Song vii. 5, 6, 9, 12, 13. I Now in the galleries of his grace Appears the king, and thus he says, ‘How fair my saints are in my sight! ‘My love how pleasant for delight!’ II Kind is thy language, Sovereign Lord, There's heavenly grace in every word: From that dear mouth a stream divine Flows sweeter than the choicest wine. III Such wondrous love awakes the lip Of saints that were almost asleep, To speak the praises of thy name, And makes our cold affections flame. IV These are the joys he lets us know In fields and villages below, Gives us a relish of his love, But keeps his noblest feast above. V In paradise within the gates An higher entertainment waits; Fruits new and old laid up in store, Where we shall feed, but thirst no more. HYMN 78. (L. M.) The Strength of Christ's Love, and the Soul's Jealousy of her own, Sol. Song viii. 5–7, 13, 14. I Who is this fair one in distress, That travels from the wilderness? And press'd with sorrows and with sins, On her beloved Lord she leans. II This is the spouse of Christ our God, Bought with the treasure of his blood: And her request and her complaint Is but the voice of every saint. III ‘O let my name engraven stand, ‘Both on thy heart and on thy hand: ‘Seal me upon thine arm; and wear ‘That pledge of love for ever there. IV ‘Stronger than death thy love is known, ‘Which floods of wrath could never drown; ‘And hell and earth in vain combine ‘To quench a fire so much divine. V ‘But I am jealous of my heart, ‘Lest it should once from thee depart; ‘Then let thy name be well imprest ‘As a fair signet on my breast. VI ‘Till thou hast brought me to thy home, ‘Where fears and doubts can never come, ‘Thy count'nance let me often see, ‘And often thou shalt hear from me. VII ‘Come, my beloved, haste away, ‘Cut short the hours of thy delay, ‘Fly like a youthful hart or roe ‘Over the hills where spices grow.’ HYMN 79. (L. M.) A Morning Hymn, Psalm xix. 5, 8. and lxxiii. 24, 25. I God of the morning, at whose voice The cheerful sun makes haste to rise, And like a giant doth rejoice To run his journey thro' the skies; II From the fair chambers of the east The circuit of his race begins, And, without weariness or rest, Round the whole earth he flies and shines: III O like the sun may I fulfil Th'appointed duties of the day, With ready mind and active will March on and keep my heavenly way. IV But I shall rove and lose the race, If God my sun should disappear, And leave me in this world's wild maze To follow every wandering star. V Lord, thy commands are clean and pure, Enlightening our beclouded eyes, Thy threatenings just, thy promise sure, Thy gospel makes the simple wise. VI Give me thy counsels for my guide, And then receive me to thy bliss; All my desires and hopes beside Are faint and cold compar'd with this. HYMN 80. (L. M.) An Evening Hymn, Psalm iv. 8. and iii. 5, 6. and cxliii. 8. I Thus far the Lord has led me on, Thus far his power prolongs my days; And every evening shall make known Some fresh memorial of his grace. II Much of my time has run to waste, And I perhaps am near my home; But he forgives my follies past, He gives me strength for days to come. III I lay my body down to sleep, Peace is the pillow for my head, While well-appointed angels keep Their watchful stations round my bed. IV In vain the sons of earth or hell Tell me a thousand frightful things, My God in safety makes me dwell Beneath the shadow of his wings. V Faith in his name forbids my fear: O may thy presence ne'er depart! And in the morning make me hear The love and kindness of thy heart. VI Thus when the night of death shall come, My flesh shall rest beneath the ground, And wait thy voice to rouse my tomb, With sweet salvation in the sound. HYMN 81. (L. M.) A Song for Morning or Evening, Lam. iii. 23. Isaiah xlv. 7. I My God, how endless is thy love! Thy gifts are every evening new, And morning mercies from above Gently distil like early dew. II Thou spread'st the curtains of the night, Great guardian of my sleeping hours; Thy sovereign word restores the light, And quickens all my drowsy powers. III I yield my powers to thy command, To thee I consecrate my days; Perpetual blessings from thine hand Demand perpetual songs of praise. HYMN 82. (L. M.) God far above Creatures; or, Man vain and mortal, Job. iv. 17–21. I Shall the vile race of flesh and blood Contend with their creator, God? Shall mortal worms presume to be More holy, wise, or just than he? II Behold he puts his trust in none Of all the spirits round his throne; Their natures, when compar'd with his, Are neither holy, just, or wise. III But how much meaner things are they Who spring from dust and dwell in clay! Touch'd by the finger of thy wrath, We faint and vanish like the moth. IV From night to day, from day to night, We die by thousands in thy sight; Bury'd in dust whole nations lie Like a forgotten vanity. V Almighty power, to thee we bow; How frail are we, how glorious thou! No more the sons of earth shall dare With an eternal God compare. HYMN 83. (C. M.) Afflictions and Death under Providence, Job. v. 6–8. I Not from the dust affliction grows, Nor troubles rise by chance; Yet we are born to care and woes, A sad inheritance. II As sparks break out from burning coals, And still are upwards borne, So grief is rooted in our souls, And man grows up to mourn. III Yet with my God I leave my cause, And trust his promis'd grace; He rules me by his well-known laws Of love and righteousness. IV Not all the pains that e'er I bore Shall spoil my future peace, For death and hell can do no more Than what my Father please. HYMN 84. (L. M.) Salvation, Righteousness, and Strength in Christ, Isaiah xlv. 21–25. I Jehovah speaks, let Israel hear, Let all the earth rejoice and fear, While God's eternal Son proclaims His sovereign honours and his names: II ‘I am the Last, and I the First, ‘The Saviour God, and God the Just; ‘There's none beside pretends to shew ‘Such justice and salvation too. III ‘Ye that in shades of darkness dwell, ‘Just on the verge of death and hell, ‘Look up to me from distant lands, ‘Light, life and heaven are in my hands. IV ‘I by my holy name have sworn, ‘Nor shall the word in vain return, ‘To me shall all things bend the knee, ‘And every tongue shall swear to me. V ‘In me alone shall men confess ‘Lies all their strength and righteousness; ‘But such as dare despise my name, ‘I'll clothe them with eternal shame. VI ‘In me the Lord, shall all the seed ‘Of Israel from their sins be freed, ‘And by their shining graces prove ‘Their interest in my pardoning love.’ HYMN 85. (S. M.) The same. [The Lord on high proclaims] I The Lord on high proclaims His Godhead from his throne; ‘Mercy and Justice are the names ‘By which I will be known. II ‘Ye dying souls that sit ‘In darkness and distress, ‘Look from the borders of the pit ‘To my recovering grace.’ III Sinners shall hear the sound; Their thankful tongues shall own ‘Our righteousness and strength is found ‘In thee, the Lord alone.’ IV In thee shall Israel trust, And see their guilt forgiven; God will pronounce the sinners just, And take the saints to heaven. HYMN 86. (C. M.) God Holy, Just, and Sovereign, Job. ix. 2–10. I How should the sons of Adam's race Be pure before their God? If he contend in righteousness We fall beneath his rod. II To vindicate my words and thoughts I'll make no more pretence; Not one of all my thousand faults Can bear a just defence. III Strong is his arm, his heart is wise; What vain presumers dare Against their Maker's hand to rise, Or tempt th'unequal war? IV Mountains by his almighty wrath From their old seats are torn; He shakes the earth from south to north, And all her pillars mourn. V He bids the sun forbear to rise, Th'obedient sun forbears: His hand with sackcloth spreads the skies And seals up all the stars. VI He walks upon the stormy sea, Flies on the stormy wind; There's none can trace his wondrous way, Or his dark footsteps find. HYMN 87. (L. M.) God dwells with the Humble and Penitent, Isaiah lvii. 15, 16. I Thus saith the High and Lofty One, ‘I sit upon my holy throne, ‘My name is God, I dwell on high, ‘Dwell in my own eternity. II ‘But I descend to worlds below, ‘On earth I have a mansion too, ‘The humble spirit and contrite ‘Is an abode of my delight. III ‘The humble soul my words revive, ‘I bid the mourning sinner live,’ Heal all the broken hearts I find, And ease the sorrows of the mind. IV ‘When I contend against their sin ‘I make them know how vile they've been; ‘But should my wrath for ever smoke ‘Their souls would sink beneath my stroke.’ V O may thy pardoning grace be nigh, Lest we should faint, despair, and die! Thus shall our better thoughts approve The methods of thy chastening love. HYMN 88. (L. M.) Life the Day of Grace and Hope, Eccl. x. 4–6, 10. I Life is the time to serve the Lord, The time to insure the great reward And while the lamp holds out to burn The vilest sinner may return. II Life is the hour that God has given To 'scape from hell, and fly to heaven, The day of grace, and mortals may Secure the blessings of the day. III The living know that they must die, But all the dead forgotten lie, Their memory and their sense is gone, Alike unknowing and unknown. IV Their hatred and their love is lost, Their envy bury'd in the dust; They have no share in all that's done Beneath the circuit of the sun. V Then what my thoughts design to do, My hands, with all your might pursue, Since no device, nor work is found, Nor faith, nor hope beneath the ground. VI There are no acts of pardon past In the cold grave to which we haste, But darkness, death, and long despair Reign in eternal silence there. HYMN 89. (L. M.) Youth and Judgment, Eccles. xi. 9. I Ye sons of Adam, vain and young, Indulge your eyes, indulge your tongue, Taste the delights your souls desire, And give a loose to all your fire: II Pursue the pleasures you design, And cheer your hearts with songs and wine, Enjoy the day of mirth; but know There is a day of judgment too. III God from on high beholds your thoughts, His book records your secret faults; The works of darkness you have done Must all appear before the sun. IV The vengeance to your follies due Should strike your hearts with terror thro'; How will ye stand before his face, Or answer for his injur'd grace? V Almighty God, turn off their eyes From these alluring vanities; And let the thunder of thy word Awake their souls to fear the Lord. HYMN 90. (C. M.) The same. [Lo the young tribes of Adam rise] I Lo the young tribes of Adam rise, And thro' all nature rove, Fulfil the wishes of their eyes, And taste the joys they love. II They give a loose to wild desires, But let the sinners know The strict account that God requires Of all the works they do. III The Judge prepares his throne on high, The frighted earth and seas Avoid the fury of his eye, And flee before his face. IV How shall I bear that dreadful day, And stand the fiery test? I give all mortal joys away To be for ever blest. HYMN 91. (L. M.) Advice to Youth; or, old Age and Death in an unconverted State, Eccles. xii. 1, 7. Isaiah lxv. 20. I Now in the heat of youthful blood Remember your Creator God, Behold the months come hastening on When you shall say, ‘My joys are gone.’ II Behold, the aged sinner goes Laden with guilt and heavy woes Down to the regions of the dead, With endless curses on his head. III The dust returns to dust again, The soul in agonies of pain Ascends to God, not there to dwell, But hears her doom, and sinks to hell. IV Eternal King, I fear thy name, Teach me to know how frail I am; And when my soul must hence remove, Give me a mansion in thy love. HYMN 92. (S. M.) Christ the Wisdom of God, Prov. viii. 1, 22–32. I Shall Wisdom cry aloud, And not her speech be heard? The voice of God's eternal word, Deserves it no regard? II ‘I was his chief delight, ‘His everlasting Son, ‘Before the first of all his works, ‘Creation, was begun. III ‘Before the flying clouds, ‘Before the solid land, ‘Before the fields, before the floods ‘I dwelt at his right hand. IV ‘When he adorn'd the skies, ‘And built them, I was there ‘To order where the sun should rise, ‘And marshal every star. V ‘When he pour'd out the sea, ‘And spread the flowing deep, ‘I gave the flood a firm decree ‘In its own bounds to keep. VI ‘Upon the empty air ‘The earth was balanc'd well; ‘With joy I saw the mansion where ‘The sons of men should dwell. VII ‘My busy thoughts at first ‘On their salvation ran, ‘Ere sin was born, or Adam's dust ‘Was fashion'd to a man. VIII ‘Then come, receive my grace, ‘Ye children, and be wise; ‘Happy the man that keeps my ways; ‘The man that shuns them dies.’ HYMN 93. (L. M.) Christ, or Wisdom, obeyed or resisted, Prov. viii. 34–36. I Thus saith the wisdom of the Lord, ‘Blest is the man that hears my word, ‘Keeps daily watch before my gates, ‘And at my feet for mercy waits. II ‘The soul that seeks me shall obtain ‘Immortal wealth and heavenly gain; ‘Immortal life is his reward, ‘Life, and the favour of the Lord. III ‘But the vile wretch that flies from me ‘Doth his own soul an injury; ‘Fools that against my grace rebel ‘Seek death, and love the road to hell.’ HYMN 94. (C. M.) Justification by Faith, not by Works; or, the Law condemns, Grace justifies, Rom. iii. 19–22. I Vain are the hopes the sons of men On their own works have built; Their hearts by nature all unclean, And all their actions guilt. II Let Jew and gentile stop their mouths Without a murmuring word, And the whole race of Adam stand Guilty before the Lord. III In vain we ask God's righteous law To justify us now, Since to convince and to condemn Is all the law can do. IV Jesus, how glorious is thy grace, When in thy name we trust, Our faith receives a righteousness That makes the sinner just. HYMN 95. (C. M.) Regeneration, John i. 13. iii. 3. &amp;c. I Not all the outward forms on earth, Nor rites that God has given, Nor will of man, nor blood, nor birth, Can raise a soul to heaven. II The sovereign will of God alone Creates us heirs of grace; Born in the image of his Son A new peculiar race. III The Spirit like some heavenly wind Blows on the sons of flesh, New models all the carnal mind, And forms the man afresh. IV Our quicken'd souls awake, and rise From the long sleep of death; On heavenly things we fix our eyes, And praise employs our breath. HYMN 96. (C. M.) Election excludes boasting, 1 Cor. i. 26–31. I But few among the carnal wise, But few of noble race, Obtain the favour of thine eyes, Almighty King of grace. II He takes the men of meanest name For sons and heirs of God; And thus he pours abundant shame On honourable blood. III He calls the fool, and makes him know The mysteries of his grace, To bring aspiring wisdom low, And all its pride abase. IV Nature has all its glories lost When brought before his throne; No flesh shall in his presence boast But in the Lord alone. HYMN 97. (L. M.) Christ our Wisdom, Righteousness, &amp;c. 1 Cor. i. 30. I Bury'd in shadows of the night We lie till Christ restores the light; Wisdom descends to heal the blind, And chase the darkness of the mind. II Our guilty souls are drown'd in tears Till his atoning blood appears, Then we awake from deep distress, And sing, ‘The Lord our Righteousness.’ III Our very frame is mix'd with sin, His Spirit makes our natures clean; Such virtues from his sufferings flow, At once to cleanse and pardon too. VI Jesus beholds where Satan reigns, Binding his slaves in heavy chains; He sets the prisoners free, and breaks The iron bondage from our necks. V Poor helpless worms in thee possess Grace, wisdom, power and righteousness; Thou art our mighty All, and we Give our whole selves, O Lord, to thee. HYMN 98. (S. M.) The same. [How heavy is the night] I How heavy is the night That hangs upon our eyes, Till Christ with his reviving light Over our souls arise! II Our guilty spirits dread To meet the wrath of heaven, But, in his righteousness array'd, We see our sins forgiven. III Unholy and impure Are all our thoughts and ways; His hands infected nature cure With sanctifying grace. IV The powers of hell agree To hold our souls in vain; He sets the sons of bondage free, And breaks the cursed chain. V Lord, we adore thy ways To bring us near to God, Thy sovereign power, thy healing grace, And thine atoning blood. HYMN 99. (C. M.) Stones made Children of Abraham; or, Grace not conveyed by Religious Parents, Matt. iii. 9. I Vain are the hopes that rebels place Upon their birth and blood, Descended from a pious race; (Their fathers now with God.) II He from the caves of earth and hell Can take the hardest stones, And fill the house of Abra'm well With new-created sons. III Such wondrous power doth he possess Who form'd our mortal frame, Who call'd the world from emptiness, The world obey'd and came. HYMN 100. (L. M.) Believe and be saved, John iii. 16–18. I Not to condemn the sons of men Did Christ, the Son of God, appear; No weapons in his hands are seen, No flaming sword, nor thunder there. II Such was the pity of our God, He lov'd the race of man so well, He sent his Son to bear our load Of sins, and save our souls from hell. III Sinners, believe the Saviour's word, Trust in his mighty name and live; A thousand joys his lips afford, His hands a thousand blessings give. VI But vengeance and damnation lies On rebels who refuse the grace; Who God's eternal Son despise The hottest hell shall be their place. HYMN 101. (L. M.) Joy in Heaven for a repenting Sinner, Luke xv. 7, 10. I Who can describe the joys that rise Thro' all the courts of paradise To see a prodigal return, To see an heir of glory born? II With joy the Father doth approve The fruit of his eternal love; The Son with joy looks down and sees The purchase of his agonies. III The Spirit takes delight to view The holy soul he form'd anew; And saints and angels join to sing The growing empire of their King HYMN 102. (L. M.) The Beatitudes, Matt. v. 3–12. I Bless'd are the humble souls that see Their emptiness and poverty; Treasures of grace to them are given, And crowns of joy laid up in heaven. II Bless'd are the men of broken heart, Who mourn for sin with inward smart; The blood of Christ divinely flows, A healing balm for all their woes. III Bless'd are the meek, who stand afar From rage and passion, noise and war; God will secure their happy state, And plead their cause against the great. IV Bless'd are the souls that thirst for grace, Hunger and long for righteousness, They shall be well supply'd and fed, With living streams and living bread. V Bless'd are the men whose bowels move And melt with sympathy and love; From Christ the Lord shall they obtain Like sympathy and love again. VI Bless'd are the pure, whose hearts are clean From the defiling powers of sin, With endless pleasure they shall see A God of spotless purity. VII Bless'd are the men of peaceful life, Who quench the coals of growing strife, They shall be call'd the heirs of bliss, The sons of God, the God of peace. VIII Bless'd are the sufferers who partake Of pain and shame for Jesus' sake; Their souls shall triumph in the Lord, Glory and joy are their reward. HYMN 103. (C. M.) Not ashamed of the Gospel, 2 Tim. i. 12. I I'm not asham'd to own my Lord, Or to defend his cause, Maintain the honour of his word, The glory of his cross. II Jesus, my God, I know his name, His name is all my trust, Nor will he put my soul to shame, Nor let my hope be lost. III Firm as his throne his promise stands, And he can well secure What I've committed to his hands Till the decisive hour. IV Then will he own my worthless name Before his Father's face, And in the new Jerusalem Appoint my soul a place. HYMN 104. (C. M.) A State of Nature and of Grace, 1 Cor. vi. 10, 11. I Not the malicious or profane, The wanton or the proud, Nor thieves, nor slanderers shall obtain The kingdom of our God. II Surprising grace! And such were we By nature and by sin, Heirs of immortal misery, Unholy and unclean. III But we are wash'd in Jesus' blood, We're pardon'd through his name; And the good Spirit of our God Has sanctify'd our frame. IV O for a persevering power To keep thy just commands! We would defile our hearts no more, No more pollute our hands. HYMN 105. (C. M.) Heaven invisible and holy, 1 Cor. ii. 9, 10. Rev. xxi. 27. I Nor eye has seen, nor ear has heard, Nor sense nor reason known What joys the father has prepar'd For those that love the Son. II But the good Spirit of the Lord Reveals a heaven to come: The beams of glory in his word Allure and guide us home. III Pure are the joys above the sky, And all the region peace; No wanton lips, nor envious eye Can see or taste the bliss. IV Those holy gates for ever bar Pollution, sin, and shame; None shall obtain admittance there But followers of the Lamb. V He keeps the Father's book of life, There all their names are found; The hypocrite in vain shall strive To tread the heavenly ground. HYMN 106. (S. M.) Dead to Sin by the Cross of Christ, Rom. vi. 1, 2, 6. I Shall we go on to sin Because thy grace abounds, Or crucify the Lord again, And open all his wounds? II Forbid it, mighty God, Nor let it e'er be said That we whose sins are crucified Should raise them from the dead. III We will be slaves no more, Since Christ has made us free, Has nail'd our tyrants to his cross, And bought our liberty. HYMN 107. (L. M.) The Fall and Recovery of Man; or, Christ and Satan at Enmity, Gen. iii. 1, 15, 17. Gal. iv. 4. Col. ii. 15. I Deceiv'd by subtle snares of hell Adam our head, our father fell, When Satan in the serpent hid Propos'd the fruit that God forbid. II Death was the threatening; death began To take possession of the man; His unborn race receiv'd the wound, And heavy curses smote the ground. III But Satan found a worse reward; Thus saith the vengeance of the Lord, ‘Let everlasting hatred be ‘Betwixt the woman's seed and thee. IV ‘The woman's seed shall be my Son, ‘He shall destroy what thou hast done, ‘Shall break thy head, and only feel ‘Thy malice raging at his heel.’ V He spake; and bid four thousand years Roll on; at length his Son appears; Angels with joy descend to earth, And sing the young Redeemer's birth. VI Lo, by the sons of hell he dies; But, as he hung 'twixt earth and skies, He gave their prince a fatal blow, And triumph'd o'er the powers below. HYMN 108. (S. M.) Christ unseen and beloved, 1 Pet. i. 8. I Not with our mortal eyes Have we beheld the Lord, Yet we rejoice to hear his name, And love him in his word. II On earth we want the sight Of our Redeemer's face, Yet, Lord, our inmost thoughts delight To dwell upon thy grace. III And when we taste thy love, Our joys divinely grow Unspeakable, like those above, And heaven begins below. HYMN 109. (L. M.) The Value of Christ and his Righteousness, Phil. iii. 7–9. I No more, my God, I boast no more Of all the duties I have done; I quit the hopes I held before To trust the merits of thy Son. II Now for the love I bear his name What was my gain I count my loss, My former pride I call my shame, And nail my glory to his cross. III Yes, and I must and will esteem All things but loss for Jesus' sake: O may my soul be found in him, And of his righteousness partake. IV The best obedience of my hands Dares not appear before thy throne; But faith can answer thy demands By pleading what my Lord has done. HYMN 110. (C. M.) Death and immediate Glory, 2 Cor. v. 1, 5–8. I There is a house not made with hands, Eternal and on high: And here my spirit waiting stands Till God shall bid it fly. II Shortly this prison of my clay Must be dissolv'd and fall, Then, O my soul, with joy obey Thy heavenly Father's call. III 'Tis he by his almighty grace That forms thee fit for heaven, And as an earnest of the place, Has his own Spirit given. IV We walk by faith of joys to come, Faith lives upon his word; But while the body is our home We're absent from the Lord. V 'Tis pleasant to believe thy grace, But we had rather see; We would be absent from the flesh, And present, Lord, with thee. HYMN 111. (C. M.) Salvation by Grace, Titus iii. 3–7. I Lord, we confess our numerous faults, How great our guilt has been! Foolish and vain were all our thoughts, And all our lives were sin. II But O, my soul, for ever praise For ever love his name, Who turns thy feet from dangerous ways Of folly, sin, and shame. III 'Tis not by works of righteousness Which our own hands have done; But we are saved by sovereign grace Abounding thro' his Son. IV 'Tis from the mercy of our God That all our hopes begin; 'Tis by the water and the blood Our souls are wash'd from sin. V 'Tis thro' the purchase of his death Who hung upon the tree, The Spirit is sent down to breathe On such dry bones as we. VI Rais'd from the dead we live anew; And justify'd by grace We shall appear in glory too, And see our Father's face. HYMN 112. (C. M.) The Brazen Serpent; or, looking to Jesus, John iii. 14–16. I So did the Hebrew prophet raise The brazen serpent high, The wounded felt immediate ease, The camp forbore to die. II ‘Look upward in the dying hour, ‘And live,’ the prophet cries; But Christ performs a nobler cure When Faith lifts up her eyes. III High on the cross the Saviour hung, High in the heavens he reigns: Here sinners by th'old serpent stung Look, and forget their pains. IV When God's own Son is lifted up, A dying world revives, The Jew beholds the glorious hope, Th'expiring Gentile lives. HYMN 113. (C. M.) Abraham's Blessings on the Gentiles, Gen. xvii. 7. Rom. xv. 8. Mark x. 14. I How large the promise! how divine To Abr'am and his seed! ‘I'll be a God to thee and thine, ‘Supplying all their need.’ II The words of his extensive love From age to age endure; The angel of the covenant proves, And seals the blessing sure III Jesus the ancient faith confirms To our great fathers given; He takes young children to his arms, And calls them heirs of heaven. IV Our God, how faithful are his ways! His love endures the same; Nor from the promise of his grace Blots out the children's name. HYMN 114. (C. M.) The same, Rom. xi. 16, 17. [Gentiles by nature we belong] I Gentiles by nature we belong To the wild olive-wood; Grace took us from the barren tree, And grafts us in the good. II With the same blessings grace endows The Gentile and the Jew; If pure and holy be the root, Such are the branches too. III Then let the children of the saints Be dedicate to God; Pour out thy Spirit on them, Lord, And wash them in thy blood. IV Thus to the parents and their seed Shall thy salvation come, And numerous households meet at last In one eternal home. HYMN 115. (C. M.) Conviction of Sin by the Law, Rom. vii. 8, 9, 14, 24. I Lord, how secure my conscience was, And felt no inward dread! I was alive without the law, And thought my sins were dead. II My hopes of heaven were firm and bright; But since the precept came With a convincing power and light, I find how vile I am. III My guilt appear'd but small before, Till terribly I saw How perfect, holy, just, and pure, Was thine eternal law. IV Then felt my soul the heavy load My sins reviv'd again, I had provok'd a dreadful God, And all my hopes were slain. V I'm like a helpless captive sold Under the power of sin; I cannot do the good I would, Nor keep my conscience clean. VI My God, I cry with every breath For some kind power to save, To break the yoke of sin and death, And thus redeem the slave. HYMN 116. (L. M.) Love to God and our Neighbour, Matt. xxii. 37–40. I Thus saith the first, the great command, ‘Let all thy inward powers unite ‘To love thy Maker and thy God, ‘With utmost vigour and delight. II ‘Then shall thy neighbour next in place ‘Share thine affections and esteem, ‘And let thy kindness to thyself ‘Measure and rule thy love to him.’ III This is the sense that Moses spoke, This did the prophets preach and prove, For want of this the law is broke, And the whole law's fulfill'd by love. IV But Oh! how base our passions are! How cold our charity and zeal! Lord, fill our souls with heavenly fire, Or we shall ne'er perform thy will. HYMN 117. (L. M.) Election sovereign and free, Rom. ix. 21–23, 20. I Behold the potter and the clay, He forms his vessels as he please: Such is our God, and such are we, The subjects of his high decrees. II Doth not the workman's power extend O'er all the mass, which part to choose And mould it for a nobler end, And which to leave for viler use? III May not the sovereign Lord on high Dispense his favours as he will, Choose some to life while others die, And yet be just and gracious still? IV What if to make his terror known, He lets his patience long endure, Suffering vile rebels to go on And seal their own destruction sure! V What if he means to shew his grace, And his electing love employs To mark out some of mortal race, And form them fit for heavenly joys! VI Shall man reply against the Lord, And call his Maker's ways unjust, The thunder of whose dreadful word Can crush a thousand worlds to dust? VII But, O my soul, if truths so bright Should dazzle and confound thy sight, Yet still his written will obey, And wait the great decisive day. VIII Then shall he make his justice known, And the whole world before his throne With joy or terror shall confess The glory of his righteousness. HYMN 118. (S. M.) Moses and Christ; or, Sins against the Law and Gospel, John i. 17. Heb. iii. 3. 5, 6. and x. 28, 29. I The law by Moses came, But peace, and truth, and love, Were brought by Christ, a nobler name, Descending from above. II Amidst the house of God Their different works were done; Moses a faithful servant stood, But Christ a faithful Son. III Then to his new commands Be strict obedience paid; O'er all his Father's house he stands The sovereign and the head. IV The man that durst despise The law that Moses brought, Behold! how terribly he dies For his presumptuous fault. V But sorer vengeance falls On that rebellious race, Who hate to hear when Jesus calls, And dare resist his grace. HYMN 119. (C. M.) The different Success of the Gospel, 1 Cor. i. 23, 24. 2 Cor. 2. 16. 1 Cor. iii. 6, 7. I Christ and his cross is all our theme; The mysteries that we speak Are scandal in the Jew's esteem, And folly to the Greek. II But souls enlighten'd from above With joy receive the word; They see what wisdom, power, and love Shines in their dying Lord. III The vital savour of his name Restores their fainting breath; But unbelief perverts the same To guilt, despair, and death. IV Till God diffuse his graces down, Like showers of heavenly rain, In vain Apollos sows the ground, And Paul may plant in vain. HYMN 120. (C. M.) Faith of Things unseen, Heb. xi. 1, 3, 8, 10. I Faith is the brightest evidence Of things beyond our sight, Breaks thro' the clouds of flesh and sense, And dwells in heavenly light. II It sets times past in present view, Brings distant prospects home, Of things a thousand years ago, Or thousand years to come. III By faith we know the worlds were made By God's almighty word; Abra'm, to unknown countries led, By faith obey'd the Lord. IV He sought a city fair and high, Built by th'eternal hands; And faith assures us, tho' we die, That heavenly building stands. HYMN 121. (C. M.) Children devoted to God, Gen. xvii. 7, 10. Acts xvi. 14, 15, 33. (For those who practise Infant Baptism.) I Thus saith the mercy of the Lord, ‘I'll be a God to thee; ‘I'll bless thy numerous race, and they ‘Shall be a seed for me.’ II Abra'm believ'd the promis'd grace And gave his sons to God; But water seals the blessing now, That once was seal'd with blood. III Thus Lydia sanctify'd her house When she receiv'd the word; Thus the believing jailor gave His household to the Lord. IV Thus later saints, eternal King, Thine ancient truth embrace; To thee their infant-offspring bring, And humbly claim the grace. HYMN 122. (L. M.) Believers buried with Christ in Baptism, Rom. vi. 3. &amp;c. I Do we not know that solemn word, That we are bury'd with the Lord, Baptiz'd into his death, and then Put off the body of our sin? II Our souls receive diviner breath, Rais'd from corruption, guilt and death; So from the grave did Christ arise, And lives to God above the skies. III No more let sin or Satan reign Over our mortal flesh again; The various lusts we serv'd before Shall have dominion now no more. HYMN 123. (C. M.) The repenting Prodigal, Luke xv. 13, &amp;c. I Behold the wretch whose lust and wine Had wasted his estate, He begs a share among the swine, To taste the husks they eat! II ‘I die with hunger here, (he cries) ‘I starve in foreign lands, ‘My father's house has large supplies, ‘And bounteous are his hands. III ‘I'll go, and with a mournful tongue ‘Fall down before his face, ‘Father I've done thy justice wrong, ‘Nor can deserve thy grace.’ IV He said, and hasten'd to his home To seek his father's love; The father saw the rebel come, And all his bowels move. V He ran, and fell upon his neck, Embrac'd and kiss'd his son; The rebel's heart with sorrow brake For follies he had done. VI ‘Take off his clothes of shame and sin,’ (The father gives command) ‘Dress him in garments white and clean, ‘With rings adorn his hand. VII ‘A day of feasting I ordain, ‘Let mirth and joy abound; ‘My son was dead, and lives again, ‘Was lost and now is found.’ HYMN 124. (L. M.) The first and second Adam, Rom. v. 12, &amp;c. I Deep in the dust before thy throne Our guilt and our disgrace we own; Great God, we own th'unhappy name Whence sprang our nature and our shame; II Adam, the sinner: at his fall Death like a conqu'ror seiz'd us all; A thousand new born babes are dead By fatal union to their head. III But whilst our spirits fill'd with awe Behold the terrors of thy law, We sing the honours of thy grace, That sent to save our ruin'd race. IV We sing thine everlasting Son, Who join'd our nature to his own; Adam the second, from the dust Raises the ruins of the first. V By the rebellion of one man Through all his seed the mischief ran; And by one man's obedience now Are all his seed made righteous too. VI Where sin did reign, and death abound, There have the sons of Adam found Abounding life; there glorious grace Reigns thro' the Lord our righteousness. HYMN 125. (C. M.) Christ's Compassion to the weak and tempted, Heb. iv. 15, 16, and v. 7. Matt. xii. 20. I With joy we meditate the grace Of our High Priest above; His heart is made of tenderness, His bowels melt with love. II Touch'd with a sympathy within He knows our feeble frame; He knows what sore temptations mean, For he has felt the same. III But spotless, innocent and pure The great Redeemer stood, While Satan's fiery darts he bore, And did resist to blood. IV He in the days of feeble flesh Pour'd out his cries and tears, And in his measure feels afresh What every member bears. V He'll never quench the smoking flax, But raise it to a flame; The bruised reed he never breaks, Nor scorns the meanest name. VI Then let our humble faith address His mercy and his power, We shall obtain delivering grace In the distressing hour. HYMN 126. (L. M.) Charity and Uncharitableness, Rom. xiv. 17, 19. 1 Cor. x. 32. I Not different food, or different dress, Compose the kingdom of our Lord, But peace and joy and righteousness, Faith and obedience to his word. II When weaker christians we despise We do the gospel mighty wrong, For God the gracious and the wise Receives the feeble with the strong. III Let pride and wrath be banish'd hence, Meekness and love our souls pursue; Nor shall our practice give offence To saints, the gentile or the Jew. HYMN 127. (L. M.) Christ's Invitation to Sinners; or, Humility and Pride, Matt. xi. 28–30. I ‘Come hither, all ye weary souls, ‘Ye heavy laden sinners, come, ‘I'll give you rest from all your toils, ‘And raise you to my heavenly home. II ‘They shall find rest that learn of me; ‘I'm of a meek and lowly mind; ‘But passion rages like the sea, ‘And pride is restless as the wind. III ‘Blest is the man whose shoulders take ‘My yoke, and bear it with delight; ‘My yoke is easy to his neck, ‘My grace shall make the burden light.’ IV Jesus, we come at thy command, With faith and hope and humble zeal Resign our spirits to thy hand, To mould and guide us at thy will. HYMN 128. (L. M.) The Apostles' Commission; or, the Gospel attested by Miracles, Mark xvi. 15, &amp;c. Matt. xxviii. 18, &amp;c. I ‘Go preach my gospel,’ saith the Lord, ‘Bid the whole earth my grace receive; ‘He shall be sav'd that trusts my word, ‘He shall be damn'd that won't believe. II ‘I'll make your great commission known, ‘And ye shall prove my gospel true ‘By all the works that I have done, ‘By all the wonders ye shall do. III ‘Go heal the sick, go raise the dead, ‘Go cast out devils in my name; ‘Nor let my prophets be afraid, ‘Tho' Greeks reproach, and Jews blaspheme. IV ‘Teach all the nations my commands, ‘I'm with you till the world shall end; ‘All power is trusted to my hands, ‘I can destroy, and I defend.’ V He spake, and light shone round his head, On a bright cloud to heaven he rode; They to the farthest nations spread The grace of their ascended God. HYMN 129. (L. M.) Submission and Deliverance; or, Abraham offering his Son, Gen. xxii. 6, &amp;c. I Saints, at your Father's heavenly word Give up your comforts to the Lord; He shall restore what you resign, Or grant you blessings more divine. II So Abraham with obedient hand Led forth his son at God's command, The wood, the fire, the knife he took, His arm prepar'd the dreadful stroke. III ‘Abraham, forbear, (the angel cry'd) ‘Thy faith is known, thy love is try'd, ‘Thy son shall live, and in thy seed ‘Shall the whole earth be bless'd indeed.’ IV Just in the last distressing hour The Lord displays delivering power; The mount of danger is the place Where we shall see surprising grace. HYMN 130. (L. M.) Love and Hatred, Phil. ii. 2. Eph. iv. 30, &amp;c. I Now by the bowels of my God, His sharp distress, his sore complaints, By his last groans, his dying blood, I charge my soul to love the saints. II Clamour, and wrath and war be gone, Envy and spite for ever cease, Let bitter words no more be known Amongst the saints, the sons of peace. III The Spirit like a peaceful dove Flies from the realms of noise and strife; Why should we vex and grieve his love, Who seals our souls to heavenly life? IV Tender and kind be all our thoughts, Thro' all our lives let mercy run; So God forgives our numerous faults For the dear sake of Christ his Son. HYMN 131. (L. M.) The Pharisee and the Publican, Luke xviii. 10, &amp;c. I Behold how sinners disagree The Publican and Pharisee! One doth his righteousness proclaim, The other owns his guilt and shame. II This man at humble distance stands, And cries for grace with lifted hands; That boldly rises near the throne, And talks of duties he has done. III The Lord their different language knows, And different answers he bestows; The humble soul with grace he crowns, Whilst on the proud his anger frowns. IV Dear Father, let me never be Join'd with the boasting Pharisee; I have no merits of my own, But plead the sufferings of thy Son. HYMN 132. (L. M.) Holiness and Grace, Tit. ii. 10–13. I So let our lips and lives express The holy gospel we profess, So let our works and virtues shine To prove the doctrine all divine. II Thus shall we best proclaim abroad The honours of our Saviour God; When the salvation reigns within, And grace subdues the power of sin. III Our flesh and sense must be deny'd, Passion and envy, lust and pride; While justice, temperance, truth and love Our inward piety approve. IV Religion bears our spirits up, While we expect that blessed hope, The bright appearance of the Lord, And faith stands leaning on his word. HYMN 133. (C. M.) Love and Charity, 1 Cor. xiii. 2–7, 13. I Let Pharisees of high esteem Their faith and zeal declare, All their religion is a dream If love be wanting there. II Love suffers long with patient eye, Nor is provok'd in haste, She lets the present injury die, And long forgets the past. III Malice and rage, those fires of hell, She quenches with her tongue; Hopes, and believes, and thinks no ill, Tho' she endure the wrong. IV She nor desires nor seeks to know The scandals of the time; Nor looks with pride on those below, Nor envies those that climb. V She lays her own advantage by To seek her neighbour's good; So God's own Son came down to die, And bought our lives with blood. VI Love is the grace that keeps her power In all the realms above; There faith and hope are known no more, But saints for ever love. HYMN 134. (L. M.) Religion vain without Love, 1 Cor. xiii. 1–3. I Had I the tongues of Greeks and Jews, And nobler speech that angels use, If love be absent, I am found Like tinkling brass, an empty sound. II Were I inspir'd to preach and tell All that is done in heaven and hell, Or could my faith the world remove, Still I am nothing without love. III Should I distribute all my store To feed the bowels of the poor, Or give my body to the flame To gain a martyr's glorious name; IV If love to God and love to men Be absent, all my hopes are vain; Nor tongues, nor gifts, nor fiery zeal The work of love can e'er fulfil. HYMN 135. (L. M.) The Love of Christ shed abroad in the Heart, Eph. iii. 16, &amp;c. I Come, dearest Lord, descend and dwell By faith and love in every breast; Then shall we know, and taste, and feel The joys that cannot be express'd. II Come, fill our hearts with inward strength, Make our enlarged souls possess, And learn the height, and breadth, and length Of thine unmeasurable grace. III Now to the God, whose power can do More than our thoughts or wishes know, Be everlasting honours done By all the church, thro' Christ his Son. HYMN 136. (C. M.) Sincerity and Hypocrisy; or, Formality in Worship, John iv. 24. Psalm cxxxix. 23, 24. I God is a Spirit just and wise, He sees our inmost mind; In vain to heaven we raise our cries And leave our souls behind. II Nothing but truth before his throne With honour can appear, The painted hypocrites are known Thro' the disguise they wear. III Their lifted eyes salute the skies, Their bending knees the ground; But God abhors the sacrifice Where not the heart is found. IV Lord, search my thoughts, and try my ways, And make my soul sincere; Then shall I stand before thy face, And find acceptance there. HYMN 137. (L. M.) Salvation by Grace in Christ, 2 Tim. i. 9, 10. I Now to the power of God supreme Be everlasting honours given, He saves from hell, (we bless his name) He calls our wandering feet to heaven. II Not for our duties or deserts, But of his own abounding grace, He works salvation in our hearts, And forms a people for his praise. III 'Twas his own purpose that begun To rescue rebels doom'd to die; He gave us grace in Christ his Son Before he spread the starry sky. IV Jesus the Lord appears at last, And makes his fathers counsels known; Declares the great transactions past, And brings immortal blessings down. V He dies; and in that dreadful night Did all the powers of hell destroy; Rising he brought our heaven to light, And took possession of the joy. HYMN 138. (C. M.) Saints in the Hand of Christ, John x. 28, 29. I Firm as the earth thy gospel stands, My Lord, my hope, my trust; If I am found in Jesus' hands My soul can ne'er be lost. II His honour is engag'd to save The meanest of his sheep, All that his heavenly Father gave His hands securely keep. III Nor death, nor hell, shall e'er remove His favourites from his breast, In the dear bosom of his love They must for ever rest. HYMN 139. (L. M.) Hope in the Covenant; or, God's Promise and Truth unchangeable, Heb. vi. 17–19. I How oft have sin and Satan strove To rend my soul from thee, my God! But everlasting is thy love, And Jesus seals it with his blood. II The oath and promise of the Lord Join to confirm the wondrous grace; Eternal power performs the word, And fills all heaven with endless praise. III Amidst temptations sharp and long My soul to this dear refuge flies: Hope is my anchor firm and strong, While tempests blow and billows rise. VI The gospel bears my spirits up; A faithful and unchanging God Lays the foundation for my hope In oaths, and promises, and blood. HYMN 140. (C. M.) A living and a dead Faith, collected from several Scriptures. I Mistaken souls! that dream of heaven, And make their empty boast Of inward joys, and sins forgiven, While they are slaves to lust. II Vain are our fancies, airy flights, If faith be cold and dead, None but a living power unites To Christ the living head. III 'Tis faith that changes all the heart, 'Tis faith that works by love, That bids all sinful joys depart, And lifts the thoughts above. IV 'Tis faith that conquers earth and hell By a celestial power; This is the grace that shall prevail In the decisive hour. V Faith must obey her Father's will As well as trust his grace; A pardoning God is jealous still For his own holiness. VI When from the curse he sets us free, He makes our natures clean, Nor would he send his Son to be The minister of sin. VII His spirit purifies our frame, And seals our peace with God; Jesus, and his salvation, came By water and by blood. HYMN 141. (S. M.) The Humiliation and Exaltation of Christ, Isaiah liii. 1–5, 10–12. I Who has believ'd thy word, Or thy salvation known? Reveal thine arm, almighty Lord, And glorify thy Son. II The Jews esteem'd him here Too mean for their belief: Sorrows his chief acquaintance were, And his companion, grief. III They turn'd their eyes away, And treated him with scorn; But 'twas their grief upon him lay, Their sorrows he has borne. IV 'Twas for the stubborn Jews, And gentiles then unknown, The God of justice pleas'd to bruise His best beloved Son. V ‘But I'll prolong his days, ‘And make his kingdom stand, ‘My pleasure, (saith the God of grace) ‘Shall prosper in his hand. VI ‘His joyful soul shall see ‘The purchase of his pain, ‘And by his knowledge justify ‘The guilty sons of men. VII ‘Ten thousand captive slaves ‘Releas'd from death and sin, ‘Shall quit their prisons and their graves ‘And own his power divine. VIII ‘Heaven shall advance my Son ‘To joys that earth deny'd; ‘Who saw the follies men had done, ‘And bore their sins, and dy'd.’ HYMN 142. (S. M.) The same, Isaiah liii. 6–9, 12. [Like sheep we went astray] I Like sheep we went astray, And broke the fold of God, Each wandering in a different way, But all the downward road. II How dreadful was the hour When God our wanderings laid, And did at once his vengeance pour Upon the Shepherd's head! III How glorious was the grace When Christ sustain'd the stroke! His life and blood the Shepherd pays A ransom for the flock. IV His honour and his breath Were taken both away; Join'd with the wicked in his death, And made as vile as they. V But God shall raise his head O'er all the sons of men, And make him see a numerous seed To recompense his pain. VI ‘I'll give him, (saith the Lord) ‘A portion with the strong; ‘He shall possess a large reward, ‘And hold his honours long.’ HYMN 143. (C. M.) Characters of the Children of God, from several Scriptures. I So new-born babes desire the breast To feed, and grow, and thrive; So saints with joy the gospel taste, And by the gospel live. II With inward gust their heart approves All that the word relates; They love the men their Father loves, And hate the works he hates. III Not all the flattering baits on earth Can make them slaves to lust; They can't forget their heavenly birth, Nor grovel in the dust. IV Not all the chains that tyrants use Shall bind their souls to vice; Faith, like a conqueror, can produce A thousand victories. V Grace, like an uncorrupting seed Abides and reigns within; Immortal principles forbid The sons of God to sin. VI Not by the terrors of a slave Do they perform his will, But with the noblest powers they have His sweet commands fulfil. VII They find access at every hour, To God within the vail; Hence they derive a quickening power, And joys that never fail. VIII O happy souls! O glorious state Of overflowing grace! To dwell so near their Father's seat, And see his lovely face. IX Lord, I address thy heavenly throne; Call me a child of thine, Send down the Spirit of thy Son To form my heart divine. X There shed thy choicest loves abroad, And make my comforts strong: Then shall I say, ‘My Father, God,’ With an unwavering tongue. HYMN 144. (C. M.) The witnessing and sealing Spirit, Rom. viii. 14, 16. Eph. i. 13, 14. I Why should the children of a king Go mourning all their days? Great Comforter, descend and bring Some tokens of thy grace. II Dost thou not dwell in all the saints, And seal the heirs of heaven? When wilt thou banish my complaints, And shew my sins forgiven? III Assure my conscience of her part In the Redeemer's blood; And bear thy witness with my heart, That I am born of God. IV Thou art the earnest of his love, The pledge of joys to come; And thy soft wings, celestial Dove, Will safe convey me home. HYMN 145. (C. M.) Christ and Aaron. Taken from Heb. vii. and ix. I Jesus, in thee our eyes behold A thousand glories more Than the rich gems and polish'd gold The sons of Aaron wore. II They first their own burnt offerings brought To purge themselves from sin; Thy life was pure without a spot, And all thy nature clean. III Fresh blood as constant as the day Was on their altar spilt; But thy one offering takes away For ever all our guilt. IV Their priesthood ran thro' several hands, For mortal was their race; Thy never-changing office stands Eternal as thy days. V Once in the circuit of a year With blood, but not his own, Aaron within the vail appears Before the golden throne; VI But Christ by his own powerful blood Ascends above the skies, And in the presence of our God Shews his own sacrifice. VII Jesus, the King of Glory, reigns On Sion's heavenly hill, Looks like a lamb that has been slain, And wears his priesthood still. VIII He ever lives to intercede Before his Father's face; Give him, my soul, thy cause to plead, Nor doubt the Father's grace. HYMN 146. (L. M.) Characters of Christ, borrowed from inanimate Things in Scripture. I Go, worship at Immanuel's feet, See in his face what wonders meet; Earth is too narrow to express His worth, his glory, or his grace. II The whole creation can afford But some faint shadows of my Lord: Nature to make his beauties known Must mingle colours not her own. III Is he compar'd to wine or bread? Dear Lord, our souls would thus be fed; That flesh, that dying blood of thine, Is bread of life, is heavenly wine. IV Is he a tree? The world receives Salvation from his healing leaves; That righteous branch, that fruitful bough, Is David's root and offspring too. V Is he a rose? Not Sharon yields Such fragrancy in all her fields: Or if the lily he assume, The vallies bless the rich perfume. VI Is he a vine? His heavenly root Supplies the boughs with life and fruit: O let a lasting union join My soul the branch to Christ the vine! VII Is he the head? Each member lives, And owns the vital powers he gives; The saints below, and saints above, Join'd by his Spirit and his love. VIII Is he a fountain? There I bathe, And heal the plague of sin and death; These waters all my soul renew, And cleanse my spotted garments too. IX Is he a fire? He'll purge my dross, But the true gold sustains no loss; Like a refiner shall he sit, And tread the refuse with his feet. X Is he a rock? How firm he proves! The rock of ages never moves; Yet the sweet streams that from him flow Attend us all the desert thro'. XI Is he a way? He leads to God, The path is drawn in lines of blood; There would I walk with hope and zeal, Till I arrive at Sion's hill. XII Is he a door? I'll enter in; Behold the pastures large and green, A paradise divinely fair, None but the sheep have freedom there. XIII Is he design'd a corner stone, For men to build their heaven upon? I'll make him my foundation too, Nor fear the plots of hell below. XIV Is he a temple? I adore Th'indwelling majesty and power; And still to this most holy place, Whene'er I pray, I turn my face. XV Is he a star? He breaks the night, Piercing the shades with dawning light; I know his glories from afar, I know the bright, the morning-star. XVI Is he a sun? His beams are grace, His course is joy, and righteousness; Nations rejoice when he appears To chase their clouds, and dry their tears. XVII O let me climb those higher skies, Where storms and darkness never rise! There he displays his powers abroad, And shines and reigns th'incarnate God. XVIII Nor earth, nor seas, nor sun, nor stars, Nor heaven his full resemblance bears; His beauties we can never trace, Till we behold him face to face. HYMN 147. (L. M.) The Names and Titles of Christ, from several Scriptures. I 'Tis from the treasures of his word I borrow titles for my Lord; Nor art, nor nature can supply Sufficient forms of majesty. II Bright image of the Father's face, Shining with undiminish'd rays; Th'eternal God's eternal Son, The heir and partner of his throne. III The King of kings, the Lord most High, Writes his own name upon his thigh: He wears a garment dipp'd in blood, And breaks the nations with his rod. IV Where grace can neither melt nor move The Lamb resents his injur'd love, Awakes his wrath without delay, And Judah's Lion tears the prey. V But when for works of peace he comes, What winning titles he assumes! Light of the World, and Life of Men; Nor bears those characters in vain. VI With tender pity in his heart He acts the Mediator's part? A friend and brother he appears And well fulfils the names he wears. VII At length the Judge his throne ascends, Divides the rebels from his friends, And saints in full fruition prove His rich variety of love. HYMN 148. As the 148th Psalm. The same. [With cheerful voice I sing] I With cheerful voice I sing The titles of my Lord, And borrow all the names Of honour from his word: Nature and art Can ne'er supply Sufficient forms Of majesty. II In Jesus we behold His Father's glorious face, Shining for ever bright With mild and lovely rays: Th'eternal God's Eternal Son Inherits and Partakes the throne. III The sovereign King of kings, The Lord of lords most high, Writes his own name upon His garment and his thigh: His name is call'd The Word of God; He rules the earth With iron rod. IV Where promises and grace Can neither melt nor move, The angry Lamb resents The injuries of his love; Awakes his wrath Without delay, As lions roar And tear the prey. V But when for works of peace The great Redeemer comes, What gentle characters, What titles he assumes! Light of the World, And life of Men; Nor will he bear Those names in vain. VI Immense compassion reigns In our Immanuel's heart, When he descends to act A Mediator's part: He is a friend And brother too Divinely kind, Divinely true. VII At length the Lord the Judge His awful throne ascends, And drives the rebels far From favourites and friends: Then shall the saints Completely prove The heights and depths Of all his love. HYMN 149. (L. M.) The Offices of Christ, from several Scriptures. I Join all the names of love and power That ever men or angels bore All are too mean to speak his worth, Or set Immanuel's glory forth. II But O what condescending ways He takes to teach his heavenly grace! My eyes with joy and wonder see What forms of love he bears for me. III The angel of the covenant stands With his commission in his hands, Sent from his Father's milder throne To make the great Salvation known. IV Great Prophet, let me bless thy name; By thee the joyful tidings came, Of wrath appeas'd, of sins forgiven, Of hell subdu'd, and peace with heaven. V My bright example, and my guide, I would be walking near thy side; O let me never run astray, Nor follow the forbidden way! VI I love my Shepherd, he shall keep My wandering soul among his sheep: He feeds his flock, he calls their names, And in his bosom bears the lambs. VII My Surety undertakes my cause, Answering his Father's broken laws; Behold my soul at freedom set; My Surety paid the dreadful debt. VIII Jesus my great High Priest has dy'd, I seek no sacrifice beside: His blood did once for all atone, And now it pleads before the throne. IX My Advocate appears on high, The Father lays his thunder by; Not all that earth or hell can say Shall turn my Father's heart away. X My Lord, my Conqueror, and my King, Thy sceptre and thy sword I sing; Thine is the victory, and I sit A joyful subject at thy feet. XI Aspire, my soul, to glorious deeds, The Captain of salvation leads? March on, nor fear to win the day, Tho' death and hell obstruct the way. XII Should death and hell, and powers unknown, Put all their forms of mischief on, I shall be safe; for Christ displays Salvation in more sovereign ways. HYMN 150. As the 148th Psalm. The same. [Join all the glorious names] I Join all the glorious names Of wisdom, love, and power, That ever mortals knew, That angels ever bore: All are too mean To speak his worth, Too mean to set My Saviour forth. II But O what gentle terms, What condescending ways Doth our Redeemer use To teach his heavenly grace! Mine eyes with joy And wonder see What forms of love He bears for me. III Array'd in mortal flesh He like an angel stands, And holds the promises And pardons in his hands: Commission'd from His Father's throne To make his grace To mortals known. IV Great prophet of my God, My tongue would bless thy name; By thee the joyful news Of our salvation came; The joyful news Of sin forgiven, Of hell subdu'd, And peace with heaven. V Be thou my counsellor, My pattern and my guide; And thro' this desert land Still keep me near thy side: O let my feet Ne'er run astray, Nor rove, nor seek The crooked way. VI I love my Shepherd's voice, His watchful eyes shall keep My wandering soul among The thousands of his sheep: He feeds his flock, He calls their names, His bosom bears The tender lambs. VII To this dear Surety's hand Will I commit my cause; He answers and fulfils His Father's broken laws: Behold my soul At freedom set! My Surety paid The dreadful debt. VIII Jesus my great High Priest Offer'd his blood and dy'd; My guilty conscience seeks No sacrifice beside: His powerful blood Did once atone; And now it pleads Before the throne. IX My Advocate appears For my defence on high, The Father bows his ear, And lays his thunder by: Not all that hell Or sin can say Shall turn his heart, His love away. X My dear Almighty Lord, My conqueror and my king, Thy sceptre, and thy sword, Thy reigning grace I sing: Thine is the power; Behold I sit In willing bonds Before thy feet. XI Now let my soul arise, And tread the tempter down; My Captain leads me forth To conquest and a crown. A feeble saint Shall win the day, Tho' death and hell Obstruct the way. XII Should all the hosts of death, And powers of hell unknown Put their most dreadful forms Of rage and mischief on; I shall be safe, For Christ displays Superior power, And guardian grace. END OF THE FIRST BOOK. BOOK II. COMPOSED ON DIVINE SUBJECTS. HYMN 1. (L. M.) A Song of Praise to God from Great Britain. I Nature with all her powers shall sing God the Creator and the King; Nor air, nor earth, nor skies, nor seas Deny the tribute of their praise. II Begin to make his glories known, Ye seraphs that sit near his throne; Tune your harps high, and spread the sound To the creation's utmost bound. III All mortal things of meaner frame, Exert your force and own his name! Whilst with our souls and with our voice We sing his honours and our joys. IV To him be sacred all we have From the young cradle to the grave: Our lips shall his loud wonders tell, And every word a miracle. V This northern isle, our native land, Lies safe in God th'Almighty's hand: Our foes of victory dream in vain, And wear the captivating chain. VI He builds and guards the British throne, And makes it gracious like his own, Makes our successive princes kind, And gives our dangers to the wind. VII Raise monumental praises high To him that thunders through the sky, And with an awful nod or frown Shakes an aspiring tyrant down. VIII Pillars of lasting brass proclaim The triumphs of th'eternal name; While trembling nations read from far The honours of the God of War. IX Thus let our flaming zeal employ Our loftiest thoughts and loudest songs; Britain pronounce with warmest joy Hosanna from ten thousand tongues. X Yet, mighty God, our feeble frame Attempts in vain to reach thy name; The strongest notes that angels raise Faint in the worship and the praise. HYMN 2. (C. M.) The Death of a Sinner. I My thoughts on awful subjects roll, Damnation and the dead; What horrors seize the guilty soul Upon a dying bed! II Lingering about these mortal shores She makes a long delay, Till like a flood with rapid force Death sweeps the wretch away. III Then swift and dreadful she descends Down to the fiery coast, Amongst abominable fiends, Herself a frightful ghost. IV There endless crowds of sinners lie, And darkness makes their chains; Tortur'd with keen despair they cry, Yet wait for fiercer pains. V Not all their anguish and their blood For their old guilt atones, Nor the compassions of a God Shall hearken to their groans. VI Amazing grace, that kept my breath, Nor bid my soul remove, Till I had learn'd my Saviour's death, And well insur'd his love! HYMN 3. (C. M.) The Death and Burial of a Saint. I Why do we mourn departing friends? Or shake at death's alarms? 'Tis but the voice that Jesus sends To call them to his arms. II Are we not tending upward too As fast as time can move? Nor would we wish the hours more slow To keep us from our love. III Why should we tremble to convey Their bodies to the tomb? There the dear flesh of Jesus lay, And left a long perfume. IV The graves of all his saints he bless'd, And soften'd every bed; Where should the dying members rest, But with the dying head? V Thence he arose, ascending high, And shew'd our feet the way; Up to the Lord our flesh shall fly At the great rising-day. VI Then let the last loud trumpet sound, And bid our kindred rise, Awake, ye nations under ground, Ye saints, ascend the skies. HYMN 4. (L. M.) Salvation in the Cross. I Here at thy cross, my dying God, I lay my soul beneath thy love, Beneath the droppings of thy blood, Jesus, nor shall it e'er remove. II Not all that tyrants think or say, With rage and lightening in their eyes, Nor hell shall fright my heart away, Should hell with all its legions rise. III Should worlds conspire to drive me thence, Moveless and firm this heart should lie; Resolv'd (for that's my last defence) If I must perish, there to die. IV But speak, my Lord, and calm my fear; Am I not safe beneath thy shade? Thy vengeance will not strike me here, Nor Satan dares my soul invade. V Yes, I'm secure beneath thy blood, And all my foes shall lose their aim, Hosanna to my dying God, And my best honours to his name. HYMN 5. (L. M.) Longing to praise Christ better. I Lord, when my thoughts with wonder roll O'er the sharp sorrows of thy soul, And read my Maker's broken laws Repair'd and honour'd by thy cross; II When I behold death, hell and sin, Vanquish'd by that dear blood of thine, And see the man that groan'd and dy'd Sit glorious by his Father's side; III My passions rise and soar above, I'm wing'd with faith and fir'd with love; Fain would I reach eternal things, And learn the notes that Gabriel sings. IV But my heart fails, my tongue complains, For want of their immortal strains; And in such humble notes as these Must fall below thy victories. V Well, the kind minute must appear When we shall leave these bodies here, These clogs of clay, and mount on high To join the songs above the sky. HYMN 6. (C. M.) A Morning Song. I Once more, my soul, the rising day Salutes thy waking eyes, Once more, my voice, thy tribute pay To him that rolls the skies. II Night unto night his name repeats, The day renews the sound, Wide as the heaven on which he sits To turn the seasons round. III 'Tis he supports my mortal frame, My tongue shall speak his praise; My sins would rouse his wrath to flame, And yet his wrath delays. IV On a poor worm thy power might tread, And I could ne'er withstand; Thy justice might have crush'd me dead, But mercy held thine hand. V A thousand wretched souls are fled Since the last setting sun, And yet thou length'nest out my thread, And yet my moments run. VI Dear God, let all my hours be thine Whilst I enjoy the light, Then shall my sun in smiles decline, And bring a pleasing night. HYMN 7. (C. M.) An Evening Song. I Dread Sov'reign, let my evening song Like holy incense rise; Assist the offerings of my tongue To reach the lofty skies. II Thro' all the dangers of the day, Thy hand was still my guard, And still to drive my wants away Thy mercy stood prepar'd. III Perpetual blessings from above Encompass me around, But Oh how few returns of love Hath my Creator found! IV What have I done for him that dy'd To save my wretched soul? How are my follies multiply'd, Fast as my minutes roll! V Lord, with this guilty heart of mine To thy dear cross I flee, And to thy grace my soul resign To be renew'd by thee. VI Sprinkled afresh with pardoning blood I lay me down to rest, As in th'embraces of my God, Or on my Saviour's breast. HYMN 8. (C. M.) A Hymn for Morning or Evening. I Hosanna, with a cheerful sound, To God's upholding hand, Ten thousand snares attend us round, And yet secure we stand. II That was a most amazing power That rais'd us with a word, And every day and every hour We lean upon the Lord. III The evening rests our weary head, And angels guard the room; We wake and we admire the bed That was not made our tomb. IV The rising morning can't assure That we shall end the day, For death stands ready at the door To seize our lives away. V Our breath is forfeited by sin To God's revenging law; We own thy grace, Immortal King, In every gasp we draw. VI God is our sun, whose daily light Our joy and safety brings: Our feeble flesh lies safe at night Beneath his shady wings. HYMN 9. (C. M.) Godly Sorrow arising from the Sufferings of Christ. I Alas! and did my Saviour bleed, And did my Sovereign die? Would he devote that sacred head For such a worm as I? II Thy body slain, sweet Jesus, thine, And bath'd in its own blood, While all expos'd to wrath divine The glorious sufferer stood. III Was it for crimes that I had done He groan'd upon the tree? Amazing pity! Grace unknown! And love beyond degree! IV Well might the sun in darkness hide, And shut his glories in, When God the mighty Maker dy'd For man the creature's sin. V Thus might I hide my blushing face While his dear cross appears, Dissolve my heart in thankfulness, And melt my eyes to tears. VI But drops of grief can ne'er repay The debt of love I owe; Here, Lord, I give myself away, 'Tis all that I can do. HYMN 10. (C. M.) Parting with Carnal Joys. I My soul forsakes her vain delight, And bids the world farewel, Base as the dirt beneath my feet, And mischievous as hell. II No longer will I ask your love, Nor seek your friendship more; The happiness that I approve Lies not within your power. III There's nothing round this spacious earth That suits my large desire; To boundless joy and solid mirth My nobler thoughts aspire. IV Where pleasure rolls its living flood, From sin and dross refin'd, Still springing from the throne of God, And fit to cheer the mind. V Th'almighty ruler of the sphere, The glorious and the great, Brings his own all-sufficience there To make our bliss complete. VI Had I the pinions of a dove I'd climb the heavenly road; There sits my Saviour dress'd in love, And there my smiling God. HYMN 11. (L. M.) The same. [I send the joys of earth away] I I send the joys of earth away, Away ye tempters of the mind, False as the smooth deceitful sea, And empty as the whistling wind. II Your streams were floating me along Down to the gulph of black despair, And whilst I listen'd to your song, Your streams had e'en convey'd me there. III Lord, I adore thy matchless grace, That warn'd me of that dark abyss, That drew me from those treacherous seas, And bid me seek superior bliss. IV Now to the shining realms above I stretch my hands, and glance mine eyes; O for the pinions of a dove To bear me to the upper skies. V There from the bosom of my God Oceans of endless pleasure roll; There would I fix my last abode, And drown the sorrows of my soul. HYMN 12. (C. M.) Christ is the Substance of the Levitical Priesthood. I The true Messiah now appears, The types are all withdrawn; So fly the shadows and the stars Before the rising dawn. II No smoking sweets, nor bleeding lambs, Nor kid, nor bullock slain, Incense and spice of costly names Would all be burnt in vain. III Aaron must lay his robes away; His mitre and his vest, When God himself comes down to be The offering and the priest. IV He took our mortal flesh to show The wonders of his love; For us he paid his life below, And prays for us above. V ‘Father, (he cries) forgive their sins, ‘For I myself have dy'd,’ And then he shews his open'd veins, And pleads his wounded side. HYMN 13. (L. M.) The Creation, Preservation, Dissolution, and Restoration of this World. I Sing to the Lord that built the skies, The Lord that rear'd this stately frame: Let half the nations sound his praise, And lands unknown repeat his name. II He form'd the seas, and form'd the hills, Made every drop and every dust, Nature and time with all their wheels, And push'd them into motion first. III Now from his high imperial throne He looks far down upon the spheres; He bids the shining orbs roll on, And round he turns our hasty years. IV Thus shall this moving engine last Till all his saints are gather'd in, Then for the trumpet's dreadful blast To shake it all to dust again! V Yet when the sound shall tear the skies, And lightning burn the globe below, Saints, you may lift your joyful eyes, There's a new heaven and earth for you. HYMN 14. (S. M.) The Lord's Day; or, Delight in Ordinances. I Welcome, sweet day of rest, That saw the Lord arise; Welcome to this reviving breast, And these rejoicing eyes! II The King himself comes near, And feasts his saints to-day, Here we may sit, and see him here, And love, and praise, and pray. III One day amidst the place, Where my dear God hath been, Is sweeter than ten thousand days Of pleasurable sin. IV My willing soul would stay In such a frame as this, And sit and sing herself away To everlasting bliss. HYMN 15. (L. M.) The Enjoyment of Christ; or, Delight in Worship. I Far from my thoughts, vain world, begone, Let my religious hours alone: Fain would my eyes my Saviour see, I wait a visit, Lord, from thee. II My heart grows warm with holy fire, And kindles with a pure desire: Come, my dear Jesus, from above, And feed my soul with heavenly love. III The trees of life immortal stand In flourishing rows at thy right hand, And in sweet murmurs by their side Rivers of bliss perpetual glide. IV Haste then, but with a smiling face, And spread the table of thy grace: Bring down a taste of fruit divine, And cheer my heart with sacred wine. V Bless'd Jesus, what delicious fare! How sweet thy entertainments are! Never did angels taste above Redeeming grace, and dying love. VI Hail, great Immanuel, all divine, In thee thy Father's glories shine; Thou brightest, sweetest, fairest one, That eyes have seen, or angels known. HYMN 16. (L. M.) [The Enjoyment of Christ; or, Delight in Worship. Part the Second.] VII Lord, what a heaven of saving grace, Shines thro' the beauties of thy face, And lights our passions to a flame! Lord, how we love thy charming name! VIII When I can say, my God is mine, When I can feel thy glories shine, I tread the world beneath my feet, And all that earth calls good or great. IX While such a scene of sacred joys Our raptur'd eyes and souls employs, Here we could sit, and gaze away A long, an everlasting day. X Well, we shall quickly pass the night To the fair coasts of perfect light; Then shall our joyful senses rove O'er the dear object of our love. XI There shall we drink full draughts of bliss, And pluck new life from heavenly trees: Yet now and then, dear Lord, bestow A drop of heaven on worms below. XII Send comforts down from thy right hand, While we pass thro' this barren land, And in thy temple let us see A glimpse of love a glimpse of thee. HYMN 17. (C. M.) God's Eternity. I Rise, rise, my soul, and leave the ground, Stretch all thy thoughts abroad, And rouse up every tuneful sound To praise th'eternal God. II Long ere the lofty skies were spread Jehovah fill'd his throne; Or Adam form'd, or angels made, The Maker liv'd alone. III His boundless years can ne'er decrease, But still maintain their prime; Eternity's his dwelling-place, And ever is his time. IV While like a tide our minutes flow, The present and the past, He fills his own immortal now, And sees our ages waste. V The sea and sky must perish too, And vast destruction come! The creatures—look, how old they grow, And wait their fiery doom! VI Well, let the sea shrink all away, And flame melt down the skies, My God shall live an endless day When th'whole creation dies. HYMN 18. (L. M.) The Ministry of Angels. I High on a hill of dazzling light, The King of Glory spreads his seat, And troops of angels stretch'd for flight Stand waiting round his awful feet. II ‘Go,’ saith the Lord, ‘my Gabriel, go, ‘Salute the virgin's fruitful womb, Luke i. 26. ‘Make haste, ye cherubs, down below, ‘Sing and proclaim the Saviour come.’ Luke ii. 13. III Here a bright squadron leaves the skies, And thick around Elisha stands; 2 Kings vi. 17. Anon a heavenly soldier flies, And breaks the chains from Peter's hands. Acts xii. 7. IV Thy winged troops, O God of hosts, Wait on thy wandering church below, Here we are sailing to thy coasts, Let angels be our convoy too. V Are they not all thy servants, Hebrews i. 14. Lord? At thy command they go and come, With cheerful haste obey thy word, And guard thy children to their home. HYMN 19. (C. M.) Our frail Bodies, and God our Preserver. I Let others boast how strong they be, Nor death, nor danger fear; But we'll confess, O Lord, to thee, What feeble things we are. II Fresh as the grass our bodies stand, And flourish bright and gay, A blasting wind sweeps o'er the land, And fades the grass away. III Our life contains a thousand springs, And dies if one begone; Strange! that a harp of thousand strings Should keep in tune so long. IV But 'tis our God supports our frame, The God that built us first; Salvation to th'Almighty Name That rear'd us from the dust. V He spoke, and straight our hearts and brains In all their motions rose; ‘Let blood,’ said he, ‘flow round the veins,’ And round the veins it flows. VI While we have breath or use our tongues Our Maker we'll adore; His Spirit moves our heaving lungs Or they would breathe no more. HYMN 20. (C. M.) Backslidings and Returns; or, the Inconstancy of our Love. I Why is my heart so far from thee, My God, my chief delight? Why are my thoughts no more by day With thee, no more by night? II Why should my foolish passions rove? Where can such sweetness be As I have tasted in thy love, As I have found in thee? III When my forgetful soul renews The savour of thy grace, My heart presumes I cannot lose The relish all my days. IV But ere one fleeting hour is pass'd, The flattering world employs Some sensual bait to seize my taste, And to pollute my joys. V Trifles of nature or of art With fair deceitful charms Intrude upon my thoughtless heart, And thrust thee from my arms. VI Then I repent and vex my soul That I should leave thee so, Where will those wild affections roll That let a Saviour go? VII Sin's promis'd joys are turn'd to pain, And I am drown'd in grief; But my dear Lord returns again, He flies to my relief. VIII Seizing my soul with sweet surprise, He draws with loving bands; Divine compassion in his eyes, And pardon in his hands. IX Wretch that I am to wander thus In chase of false delight! Let me be fasten'd to thy cross Rather than lose thy sight. X Make haste, my days, to reach the goal, And bring my heart to rest On the dear centre of my soul, My God, my Saviour's breast. HYMN 21. (L. M.) A Song of Praise to God the Redeemer. I Let the old heathens tune their song Of great Diana and of Jove; But the sweet theme that moves my tongue Is my Redeemer and his love. II Behold a God descends and dies To save my soul from gaping hell; How the black gulph where Satan lies Yawn'd to receive me when I fell! III How justice frown'd and vengeance stood To drive me down to endless pain! But the great Son propos'd his blood, And heavenly wrath grew mild again. IV Infinite Lover, gracious Lord, To thee be endless honours given; Thy wondrous name shall be ador'd Round the wide earth, and wider heaven. HYMN 22. (L. M.) With God is terrible Majesty. I Terrible God, that reign'st on high, How awful is thy thundering hand! Thy fiery bolts how fierce they fly! Nor can all earth or hell withstand. II This the old-rebel angels knew, And Satan fell beneath thy frown: Thine arrows struck the traitor through, And weighty vengeance sunk him down. III This Sodom felt, and feels it still, And roars beneath th'eternal load, ‘With endless burnings who can dwell, ‘Or bear the fury of a God!’ IV Tremble, ye sinners, and submit, Throw down your arms before his throne, Bend your heads low beneath his feet, Or his strong hand shall crush you down. V And ye, bless'd saints, that love him too, With rev'rence bow before his name, Thus all his heavenly servants do: God is a bright and burning flame. HYMN 23. (L. M.) The Sight of God and Christ in Heaven. I Descend from heaven, Immortal Dove, Stoop down and take us on thy wings, And mount and bear us far above The reach of these inferior things: II Beyond, beyond this lower sky, Up where eternal ages roll, Where solid pleasures never die, And fruits immortal feast the soul. III O for a sight, a pleasing sight Of our almighty Father's throne! There sits our Saviour crown'd with light, Cloth'd in a body like our own. IV Adoring saints around him stand, And thrones and powers before him fall; The God shines gracious thro' the man, And sheds sweet glories on them all. V O what amazing joys they feel While to their golden harps they sing, And sit on every heavenly hill, And spread the triumphs of their King! VI When shall the day, dear Lord, appear That I shall mount to dwell above, And stand and bow amongst them there, And view thy face, and sing, and love! HYMN 24. (L. M.) The Evil of Sin visible in the Fall of Angels and Men. I When the great Builder arch'd the skies, And form'd all nature with a word, The joyful cherubs tun'd his praise, And ev'ry bending throne ador'd. II High in the midst of all the throng, Satan, a tall archangel, sat, Job xxxviii. 7.Amongst the morning stars he sung Till sin destroy'd his heavenly state. III 'Twas sin that hurl'd him from his throne, Grov'ling in fire the rebel lies: ‘How art thou sunk in darkness down, ‘Son of the morning, from the skies! Isaiah xiv. 12. IV And thus our two first parents stood Till sin defil'd the happy place; They lost their garden and their God, And ruin'd all their unborn race. V So sprung the plague from Adam's bower And spread destruction all abroad; Sin, the curst name, that in one hour Spoil'd six days labour of a God. VI Tremble, my soul, and mourn for grief, That such a foe should seize thy breast; Fly to thy Lord for quick relief; O may he slay this treacherous guest. VII Then to thy throne, victorious King, Then to thy throne our shouts shall rise, Thine everlasting arm we sing, For sin the monster bleeds and dies. HYMN 25. (C. M.) Complaining of Spiritual Sloth. I My drowsy powers, why sleep ye so? Awake, my sluggish soul! Nothing has half thy work to do, Yet nothing's half so dull. II The little ants for one poor grain Labour, and tug, and strive, Yet we who have a heaven t'obtain, How negligent we live! III We for whose sake all nature stands And stars their courses move; We for whose guard the angel bands Come flying from above; IV We for whom God the Son came down, And labour'd for our good, How careless to secure that crown He purchas'd with his blood! V Lord, shall we live so sluggish still, And never act our parts? Come, holy Dove, from th'heavenly hill, And sit and warm our hearts. VI Then shall our active spirits move, Upward our souls shall rise: With hands of faith and wings of love We'll fly and take the prize. HYMN 26. (L. M.) God invisible. I Lord, we are blind, we mortals blind, We can't behold thy bright abode; O 'tis beyond a creature-mind To glance a thought half way to God. II Infinite leagues beyond the sky The great Eternal reigns alone, Where neither wings nor soul can fly, Nor angels climb the topless throne. III The Lord of glory builds his seat Of gems insufferably bright, And lays beneath his sacred feet Substantial beams of gloomy night. IV Yet, glorious Lord, thy gracious eyes Look thro', and cheer us from above; Beyond our praise thy grandeur flies, Yet we adore, and yet we love. HYMN 27. (L. M.) Praise ye him, all his Angels, Psalm cxlviii. 2. I God! the eternal awful name That the whole heavenly army fears, That shakes the wide creation's frame, And Satan trembles when he hears. II Like flames of fire his servants are, And light surrounds his dwelling-place; But, O ye fiery flames, declare The brighter glories of his face. III 'Tis not for such poor worms as we To speak so infinite a thing, But your immortal eyes survey The beauties of your sovereign King. IV Tell how he shews his smiling face, And clothes all heaven in bright array; Triumph and joy run thro' the place, And songs eternal as the day. V Speak, (for you feel his burning love) What zeal it spreads thro' all your frame: That sacred fire dwells all above, For we on earth have lost the name. VI Sing of his power and justice too, That infinite right hand of his That vanquish'd Satan and his crew, And thunder drove them down from bliss. VII What mighty storms of poison'd darts Were hurl'd upon the rebels there! What deadly javelins nail'd their hearts Fast to the racks of long despair! VIII Shout to your King, you heavenly host, You that beheld the sinking foe; Firmly ye stood when they were lost; Praise the rich grace that kept you so. IX Proclaim his wonders from the skies, Let every distant nation hear; And while you sound his lofty praise, Let humble mortals bow and fear. HYMN 28. (C. M.) Death and Eternity. I Stoop down, my thoughts, that use to rise, Converse awhile with death: Think how a gasping mortal lies, And pants away his breath. II His quivering lip hangs feebly down, His pulses faint and few, Then, speechless, with a doleful groan He bids the world adieu. III But, O the soul that never dies! At once it leaves the clay! Ye thoughts, pursue it where it flies, And track its wondrous way. IV Up to the courts where angels dwell, It mounts triumphing there, Or devils plunge it down to hell In infinite despair. V And must my body faint and die? And must this soul remove? O for some guardian angel nigh To bear it safe above! VI Jesus, to thy dear faithful hand My naked soul I trust, And my flesh waits for thy command To drop into my dust. HYMN 29. (C. M.) Redemption by Price and Power. I Jesus, with all thy saints above My tongue would bear her part, Would sound aloud thy saving love, And sing thy bleeding heart. II Bless'd be the Lamb, my dearest Lord, Who bought me with his blood, And quench'd his Father's flaming sword In his own vital flood: III The Lamb that freed my captive soul From Satan's heavy chains, And sent the lion down to howl Where hell and horror reigns. IV All glory to the dying Lamb, And never ceasing praise, While angels live to know his name, Or saints to feel his grace. HYMN 30. (S. M.) Heavenly Joy on Earth. I Come, we that love the Lord, And let our joys be known; Join in a song with sweet accord, And thus surround the throne. II The sorrows of the mind Be banish'd from the place! Religion never was design'd To make our pleasures less. III Let those refuse to sing That never knew our God, But favourites of the heavenly King May speak their joys abroad. IV The God that rules on high, And thunders when he please, That rides upon the stormy sky, And manages the seas; V This awful God is ours, Our Father and our love, He shall send down his heavenly powers To carry us above. VI There we shall see his face, And never, never sin; There from the rivers of his grace Drink endless pleasures in. VII Yes, and before we rise To that immortal state, The thoughts of such amazing bliss Should constant joys create. VIII The men of grace have found Glory begun below, Celestial fruits on earthly ground From faith and hope may grow. IX The hill of Sion yields A thousand sacred sweets Before we reach the heavenly fields, Or walk the golden streets. X Then let our songs abound, And every tear be dry; We're marching thro' Immanuel's ground To fairer worlds on high. HYMN 31. (L. M.) Christ's Presence makes Death easy. I Why should we start and fear to die? What timorous worms we mortals are! Death is the gate of endless joy, And yet we dread to enter there. II The pains, the groans, and dying strife, Fright our approaching souls away; Still we shrink back again to life, Fond of our prison and our clay. III O, if my Lord would come and meet, My soul should stretch her wings in haste, Fly fearless thro' Death's iron gate, Nor feel the terrors as she past. IV Jesus can make a dying bed, Feel soft as downy pillows are, While on his breast I lean my head, And breathe my life out sweetly there. HYMN 32. (C. M.) Frailty and Folly. I How short and hasty is our life! How vast our souls' affairs! Yet senseless mortals vainly strive To lavish out their years. II Our days run thoughtlessly along, Without a moment's stay; Just like a story or a song We pass our lives away. III God from on high invites us home, But we march heedless on, And ever hastening to the tomb, Stoop downwards as we run. IV How we deserve the deepest hell That slight the joys above! What chains of vengeance should we feel That break such cords of love! V Draw us, O God, with sovereign grace, And lift our thoughts on high, That we may end this mortal race And see salvation nigh. HYMN 33. (C. M.) The blessed Society in Heaven. I Raise thee, my soul, fly up and run Thro' every heavenly street, And say, There's nought below the sun That's worthy of thy feet. II Thus will we mount on sacred wings And tread the courts above; Nor earth, nor all her mightiest things Shall tempt our meanest love. III There on a high majestic throne Th'Almighty Father reigns, And sheds his glorious goodness down On all the blissful plains. IV Bright like a sun the Saviour sits, And spreads eternal noon, No evenings there, nor gloomy nights, To want the feeble moon. V Amidst! those ever-shining skies Behold the sacred Dove, While banish'd sin and sorrow flies From all the realms of love. VI The glorious tenants of the place Stand bending round the throne; An saints and seraphs sing and praise The infinite Three One. VII But O what beams of heavenly grace Transport them all the while! Ten thousand smiles from Jesus' face, And love in every smile! VIII Jesus, and when shall that dear day, That joyful hour appear, When I shall leave this house of clay To dwell amongst them there? HYMN 34. (C. M.) Breathing after the Holy Spirit; or, Fervency of Devotion desired. I Come, holy Spirit, heavenly Dove With all thy quickening powers, Kindle a flame of sacred love, In these cold hearts of ours. II Look, how we grovel here below, Fond of these trifling toys; Our souls can neither fly nor go To reach eternal joys. III In vain we tune our formal songs, In vain we strive to rise; Hosannas languish on our tongues, And our devotion dies. IV Dear Lord! and shall we ever lie At this poor dying rate? Our love so faint, so cold to thee? And thine to us so great? V Come, holy Spirit, heavenly Dove, With all thy quickening powers; Come, shed abroad a Saviour's love, And that shall kindle ours. HYMN 35. (C. M.) Praise to God for Creation and Redemption. I Let them neglect thy glory, Lord, Who never knew thy grace, But our loud songs shall still record The wonders of thy praise. II We raise our shouts, O God, to thee, And send them to thy throne, All glory to th'United Three, The Undivided One. III 'Twas he (and we'll adore his name) That form'd us by a word, 'Tis he restores our ruin'd frame; Salvation to the Lord. IV Hosanna! let the earth and skies Repeat the joyful sound, Rocks, hills, and vales, reflect the voice In one eternal round. HYMN 36. (S. M.) Christ's Intercession. I Well, the Redeemer's gone T'appear before our God, To sprinkle o'er the flaming throne With his atoning blood. II No fiery vengeance now, Nor burning wrath comes down; If justice call for sinner's blood, The Saviour shews his own. III Before his Father's eye Our humble suit he moves, The Father lays his thunder by, And looks, and smiles, and loves. IV Now may our joyful tongues Our Maker's honour sing, Jesus the priest receives our songs, And bears them to the King. V We bow before his face, And sound his glories high, ‘Hosanna to the God of grace ‘That lays his thunder by. VI ‘On earth thy mercy reigns, ‘And triumphs all above;’ But, Lord, how weak are mortal strains To speak immortal love! VII How jarring and how low Are all the notes we sing! Sweet Saviour, tune our songs anew, And they shall please the King. HYMN 37. (C. M.) The same. [Christ's Intercession.] I Lift up your eyes to th'heavenly seats Where your Redeemer stays; Kind Intercessor, there he sits, And loves, and pleads, and prays. II 'Twas well, my soul, he dy'd for thee, And shed his vital blood, Appeas'd stern justice on the tree, And then arose to God. III Petitions now and praise may rise, And saints their offerings bring, The priest with his own sacrifice Presents them to the King. IV Let papists trust what names they please, Their saints and angels boast; We've no such advocates as these, Nor pray to th'heavenly host. V Jesus alone shall bear my cries Up to his Father's throne, He, dearest Lord! perfumes my sighs, And sweetens every groan. VI Ten thousand praises to the King, Hosanna in the Highest; Ten thousand thanks our spirits bring To God and to his Christ. HYMN 38. (C. M.) Love to God. I Happy the heart where graces reign, Where love inspires the breast; Love is the brightest of the train, And strengthens all the rest. II Knowledge, alas! 'tis all in vain, And all in vain our fear, Our stubborn sins will fight and reign If love be absent there. III 'Tis love that makes our cheerful feet In swift obedience move, The devils know and tremble too, But Satan cannot love. IV This is the grace that lives and sings When faith and hope shall cease, 'Tis this shall strike our joyful strings In the sweet realms of bliss. V Before we quite forsake our clay, Or leave this dark abode, The wings of love bear us away To see our smiling God. HYMN 39. (C. M.) The Shortness and Misery of Life. I Our days, alas! our mortal days Are short and wretched too; ‘Evil and few,’ Gen. xlvii. 9. the patriarch says, And well the patriarch knew. II 'Tis but at best a narrow bound That heaven allows to men, And pains and sins run through the round Of threescore years and ten. III Well, if ye must be sad and few, Run on my days in haste; Moments of sin, and months of woe, Ye cannot fly too fast. IV Let heavenly love perpare my soul, And call her to the skies, Where years of long salvation roll, And glory never dies. HYMN 40. (C. M.) Our Comfort in the Covenant made with Christ. I Our God, how firm his promise stands, E'en when he hides his face! He trusts in our Redeemer's hands His glory and his grace. II Then why, my soul, these sad complaints, Since Christ and we are one? Thy God is faithful to his saints, Is faithful to his Son. III Beneath his smiles my heart has liv'd, And part of heaven possess'd; I praise his name for grace receiv'd, And trust him for the rest. HYMN 41. (L. M.) A Sight of God mortifies us to the World. I Up to the fields where angels lie, And living waters gently roll, Fain would my thoughts leap out and fly, But sin hangs heavy on my soul. II Thy wondrous blood, dear dying Christ, Can make this load of guilt remove; And thou canst bear me where thou fly'st, On thy kind wings celestial Dove! III O might I once mount up and see The glories of the eternal skies, What little things these worlds would be! How despicable to my eyes! IV Had I a glance of thee, my God, Kingdoms and men would vanish soon, Vanish as tho' I saw them not, As a dim candle dies at noon. V Then they might fight, and rage, and rave, I should perceive the noise no more Than we can hear a shaking leaf, While rattling thunders round us roar. VI Great All in All, Eternal King, Let me but view thy lovely face, And all my powers shall bow, and sing Thine endless grandeur and thy grace. HYMN 42. (C. M.) Delight in God. I My God, what endless pleasures dwell Above at thy right hand! The courts below, how amiable, Where all thy graces stand! II The swallow near thy temple lies, And chirps a cheerful note; The lark mounts upwards to thy skies, And tunes her warbling throat: III And we, when in thy presence, Lord, We shout with joyful tongues, Or sitting round our Father's board, We crown the feast with songs. IV While Jesus shines with quickening grace, We sing and mount on high; But if a frown becloud his face, We faint, and tire, and die. V Just as we see the lonesome dove Bemoan her widow'd state, Wandering she flies thro' all the grove, And mourns her loving mate. VI Just so our thoughts from thing to thing In restless circles rove, Just so we droop, and hang the wing, When Jesus hides his love. HYMN 43. (L. M.) Christ's Sufferings and Glory. I Now for a tune of lofty praise To great Jehovah's equal Son! Awake, my voice, in heavenly lays, Tell the loud wonders he hath done. II Sing how he left the worlds of light And the bright robes he wore above, How swift and joyful was his flight On wings of everlasting love. III Down to this base, this sinful earth, He came to raise our nature high; He came t'atone almighty wrath; Jesus the God was born to die. IV Hell and its lions roar'd around, His precious blood the monsters spilt, While weighty sorrows press'd him down, Large as the loads of all our guilt. V Deep in the shades of gloomy death Th'almighty Captive prisoner lay, Th'almighty Captive left the earth, And rose to everlasting day. VI Lift up your eyes, ye sons of light, Up to his throne of shining grace, See what immortal glories sit Round the sweet beauties of his face. VII Amongst a thousand harps and songs Jesus the God exalted reigns, His sacred name fills all their tongues, And echoes thro' the heavenly plains! HYMN 44. (L. M.) Hell; or, the Vengeance of God. I With holy fear and humble song, The dreadful God our souls adore; Reverence and awe becomes the tongue That speaks the terrors of his power. II Far in the deep where darkness dwells, The land of horror and despair, Justice has built a dismal hell, And laid her stores of vengeance there. III Eternal plagues and heavy chains, Tormenting racks and fiery coals, And darts t'inflict immortal pains Dy'd in the blood of damned souls. IV Their Satan the first sinner lies, And roars, and bites his iron bands: In vain the rebel strives to rise, Crush'd with the weight of both thine hands. V There guilty ghosts of Adam's race Shriek out, and howl beneath thy rod; Once they could scorn a Saviour's grace, But they incens'd a dreadful God. VI Tremble, my soul, and kiss the Son; Sinners obey the Saviour's call; Else your damnation hastens on, And hell gapes wide to wait your fall. HYMN 45. (L. M.) God's Condescension to our Worship. I Thy favours, Lord, surprise our souls; Will the Eternal dwell with us? What canst thou find beneath the poles To tempt thy chariot downward thus? II Still might he fill his starry throne, And please his ears with Gabriel's songs; But th'heavenly majesty comes down, And bows to hearken to our tongues. III Great God, what poor returns we pay For love so infinite as thine! Words are but air, and tongues but clay, But thy compassion's all divine. HYMN 46. (L. M.) God's Condescension to Human Affairs. I Up to the Lord that reigns on high, And views the nations from afar, Let everlasting praises fly, And tell how large his bounties are. II He that can shake the worlds he made, Or with his word, or with his rod, His goodness how amazing great! And what a condescending God! III God that must stoop to view the skies, And bow to see what angels do, Down to our earth he casts his eyes, And bends his footsteps downward too. IV He over-rules all mortal things, And manages our mean affairs; On humble souls the King of kings Bestows his counsels and his cares. V Our sorrows and our tears we pour Into the bosom of our God, He hears us in the mournful hour, And helps us bear the heavy load. VI In vain might lofty princes try Such condescension to perform; For worms were never rais'd so high Above their meanest fellow-worm. VII O could our thankful hearts devise A tribute equal to thy grace, To the third heaven our songs should rise, And teach the golden harps thy praise. HYMN 47. (L. M.) Glory and Grace in the Person of Christ. I Now to the Lord a noble song! Awake, my soul, awake, my tongue; Hosanna to th'eternal name, And all his boundless love proclaim. II See where it shines in Jesus' face, The brightest image of his grace; God, in the person of his Son, Has all his mightiest works outdone. III The spacious earth and spreading flood Proclaim the wise the powerful God; And thy rich glories from afar Sparkle in every rolling star. IV But in his looks a glory stands, The noblest labour of thine hands: The pleasing lusture of his eyes Outshines the wonders of the skies. V Grace, 'tis a sweet, a charming theme; My thoughts rejoice at Jesus' name: Ye angels, dwell upon the sound, Ye heavens reflect it to the ground! VI O, may I live to reach the place Where he unveils his lovely face, Where all his beauties you behold, And sing his name to harps of gold! HYMN 48. (C. M.) Love to the Creatures is dangerous. I How vain are all things here below! How false, and yet how fair! Each pleasure hath its poison too, And every sweet a snare. II The brightest things below the sky Give but a flattering light; We should suspect some danger nigh Where we possess delight. III Our dearest joys, and nearest friends, The partners of our blood, How they divide our wavering minds, And leave but half for God! IV The fondness of a creature's love, How strong it strikes the sense! Thither the warm affections move, Nor can we call them thence. V Dear Saviour, let thy beauties be My soul's eternal food; And grace command my heart away From all created good. HYMN 49. (C. M.) Moses dying in the Embraces of God. I Death cannot make our souls afraid If God be with us there; We may walk thro' her darkest shade, And never yield to fear. II I could renounce my all below If my Creator bid, And run if I were call'd to go, And die as Moses did. III Might I but climb to Pisgah's top, And view the promis'd land, My flesh itself should long to drop, And pray for the command. IV Clasp'd in my heavenly Father's arms I would forget my breath, And lose my life among the charms Of so divine a death. HYMN 50. (L. M.) Comfort under Sorrows and Pains. I Now let the Lord my Saviour smile, And shew my name upon his heart, I would forget my pains awhile, And in the pleasure lose the smart. II But Oh it swells my sorrows high To see my blessed Jesus frown! My spirits sink, my comforts die, And all the springs of life are down. III Yet why, my soul, why these complaints? Still while he frowns, his bowels move; Still on his heart he bears his saints, And feels their sorrows and his love. IV My name is printed on his breast; His book of life contains my name; I'd rather have it there impress'd Than in the bright records of fame. V When the last fire burns all things here Those letters shall securely stand, And in the Lamb's fair book appear Writ by th'eternal Father's hand. VI Now shall my minutes smoothly run, Whilst here I wait my Father's will; My rising and my setting sun Roll gently up and down the hill. HYMN 51. (L. M.) God the Son equal with the Father. I Bright King of glory, dreadful God! Our spirits bow before thy seat, To thee we lift an humble thought, And worship at thine awful feet. II Thy power hath form'd, thy wisdom sways All nature with a sovereign word; And the bright world of stars obeys The will of their superior Lord. III Mercy and truth unite in one, And smiling sit at thy right hand; Eternal justice guards thy throne, And vengeance waits thy dread command. IV A thousand seraphs strong and bright Stand round the glorious Deity; But who amongst the sons of light Pretends comparison with thee? V Yet there is one of human frame, Jesus, array'd in flesh and blood, Thinks it no robbery to claim A full equality with God. VI Their glory shines with equal beams; Their essence is for ever one, Tho' they are known by different names, The Father God, and God the Son. VII Then let the name of Christ our King With equal honours be ador'd; His praise let every angel sing, And all the nations own their Lord. HYMN 52. (C. M.) Death dreadful, or delightful. I Death! 'tis a melancholy day To those that have no God, When the poor soul is forc'd away To seek her last abode. II In vain to heaven she lifts her eyes, But guilt, a heavy chain, Still drags her downward from the skies To darkness, fire, and pain. III Awake and mourn, ye heirs of hell, Let stubborn sinners fear, You must be driven from earth, and dwell A long for-ever there. IV See how the pit gapes wide for you, And flashes in your face, And thou, my soul, look downwards too, And sing recovering grace. V He is a God of sovereign love That promis'd heaven to me, And taught my thoughts to soar above, Where happy spirits be. VI Prepare me, Lord, for thy right hand, Then come the joyful day, Come, death, and some celestial band To bear my soul away. HYMN 53. (C. M.) The Pilgrimage of the Saints; or, Earth and Heaven. I Lord! what a wretched land is this That yields us no supply! No cheering fruits, no wholesome trees, Nor streams of living joy! II But pricking thorns thro' all the ground And mortal poisons grow, And all the rivers that are found With dangerous waters flow. III Yet the dear path to thine abode Lies thro' this horrid land; Lord! we would keep the heavenly road, And run at thy command. IV Our souls shall tread the desert through With undiverted feet; And faith and flaming zeal subdue The terrors that we meet. V A thousand savage beasts of prey Around the forest roam; But Judah's Lion guards the way, And guides the strangers home. VI Long nights and darkness dwell below, With scarce a twinkling ray; But the bright world to which we go Is everlasting day. VII By glimmering hopes and gloomy fears We trace the sacred road, Thro' dismal deeps and dangerous snares We make our way to God. VIII Our journey is a thorny maze, But we march upward still; Forget these troubles of the way, And reach at Zion's hill. IX See the kind angels at the gates, Inviting us to come; There Jesus the forerunner waits To welcome travellers home. X There on a green and flowery mount Our weary souls shall sit, And with transporting joys recount The labours of our feet. XI No vain discourse shall fill our tongue, Nor trifles vex our ear, Infinite grace shall be our song, And God rejoice to hear. XII Eternal glories to the King That brought us safely through; Our tongues shall never cease to sing, And endless praise renew. HYMN 54. (C. M.) God's Presence is Light in Darkness. I My God, the spring of all my joys, The life of my delights, The glory of my brightest days, And comfort of my nights. II In darkest shades if he appear, My dawning is begun; He is my soul's sweet morning star, And he my rising sun. III The opening heavens around me shine With beams of sacred bliss, While Jesus shews his heart is mine, And whispers, ‘I am his!’ IV My soul would leave this heavy clay At that transporting word, Run up with joy the shining way T'embrace my dearest Lord. V Fearless of hell and ghastly death I'd break thro' every foe; The wings of love, and arms of faith Should bear me conqueror through. HYMN 55. (C. M.) Frail Life and succeeding Eternity. I Thee we adore, eternal name, And humbly own to thee, How feeble is our mortal frame! What dying worms are we! II Our wasting lives grow shorter still As months and days increase; And every beating pulse we tell Leaves but the number less. III The year rolls round, and steals away The breath that first it gave; Whate'er we do, where'er we be, We're travelling to the grave. IV Dangers stand thick through all the ground To push us to the tomb, And fierce diseases wait around To hurry mortals home. V Good God! on what a slender thread Hand everlasting things! Th'eternal states of all the dead Upon life's feeble strings. VI Infinite joy or endless woe Attends on every breath; And yet how unconcern'd we go Upon the brink of death! VII Waken, O Lord, our drowsy sense To walk this dangerous road; And if our souls be hurry'd hence May they be found with God! HYMN 56. (C. M.) The Misery of being without God in this World; or, vain Prosperity. I No, I shall envy them no more Who grow profanely great, Tho' they increase their golden store, And rise to wondrous height. II They taste of all the joys that grow Upon this earthly clod, Well they may search the creature thro', For they have ne'er a God. III Shake off the thoughts of dying too, And think your life your own; But death comes hastening on to you To mow your glory down. IV Yes, you must bow your stately head, Away your spirit flies, And no kind angel near your bed To bear it to the skies. V Go now, and boast of all your stores, And tell how bright you shine; Your heaps of glittering dust are yours, And my Redeemer's mine. HYMN 57. (L. M.) The Pleasures of a good Conscience. I Lord, how secure and bless'd are they Who feel the joys of pardon'd sin? Should storms of wrath shake earth and sea, Their minds have heaven and peace within. II The day glides sweetly o'er their heads, Made up of innocence and love? And soft and silent as the shades Their nightly minutes gently move. III Quick as their thoughts their joys come on, But fly not half so fast away; Their souls are ever bright as noon, And calm as summer evenings be. IV How oft they look to th'heavenly hills Where groves of living pleasure grow! And longing hopes and cheerful smiles Sit undisturb'd upon their brow. V They scorn to seek our golden toys, But spend the day and share the night In numbering o'er the richer joys That heaven prepares for their delight. VI While wretched we, like worms and moles, Lie grovelling in the dust below: Almighty grace, renew our souls, And we'll aspire to glory too. HYMN 58. (C. M.) The Shortness of Life, and the Goodness of God. I Time! what an empty vapour 'tis! And days how swift they are! Swift as an Indian arrow flies, Or like a shooting star. II The present moments just appear, Then slide away in haste, That we can never say, ‘They're here,’ But only say, ‘They're past.’ III Our life is ever on the wing, And death is ever nigh; The moment when our lives begin We all begin to die. IV Yet, mighty God, our fleeting days Thy lasting favours share, Yet with the bounties of thy grace Thou load'st the rolling year. V 'Tis sovereign mercy finds us food, And we are cloth'd with love; While grace stands pointing out the road, That leads our souls above. VI His goodness runs an endless round; All glory to the Lord: His mercy never knows a bound, And be his name ador'd! VII Thus we begin the lasting song, And when we close our eyes, Let the next age thy praise prolong Till time and nature dies. HYMN 59. (C. M.) Paradise on Earth. I Glory to God that walks the sky, And sends his blessings through, That tells his saints of joys on high, And gives a taste below. II Glory to God that stoops his throne That dust and worms may see't, And brings a glimpse of glory down Around his sacred feet. III When Christ, with all his graces crown'd, Sheds his kind beams abroad, 'Tis a young heaven on earthly ground, And glory in the bud. IV A blooming Paradise of joy In this wild desert springs; And every sense I straight employ On sweet celestial things. V White lilies all around appear, And each his glory shows; The rose of Sharon blossoms here, The fairest flower that blows. VI Cheerful I feast on heavenly fruit, And drink the pleasures down, Pleasures that flow hard by the foot Of the eternal throne. VII But ah! how soon my joys decay! How soon my sins arise, And snatch the heavenly scene away From these lamenting eyes! VIII When shall the time, dear Jesus, when The shining day appear, That I shall leave those clouds of sin, And guilt and darkness here? IX Up to the fields above the skies My hasty feet would go, There everlasting flowers arise, And joys unwithering grow. HYMN 60. (L. M.) The Truth of God the Promiser; or, the Promises are our Security. I Praise, everlasting praise be paid To him that earth's foundations laid; Praise to the God whose strong decrees Sway the creation as he please. II Praise to the goodness of the Lord Who rules his people by his word, And there as strong as his decrees He sets his kindest promises. III Firm are the words his prophets give, Sweet words on which his children live; Each of them is the voice of God, Who spoke and spread the skies abroad. IV Each of them powerful as that sound That bid the new-made heavens go round; And stronger than the solid poles On which the wheel of nature rolls. V Whence then should doubts and fears arise? Why trickling sorrows drown our eyes? Slowly, alas, our mind receives The comforts that our Maker gives. VI O for a strong a lasting faith, To credit what th'Almighty saith! T'embrace the message of his Son, And call the joys of heaven our own. VII Then should the earth's old pillars shake, And all the wheels of nature break, Our steady souls should fear no more Than solid rocks when billows roar. VIII Our everlasting hopes arise Above the ruinable skies, Where the eternal Builder reigns, And his own courts his power sustains. HYMN 61. (C. M.) A Thought of Death and Glory. I My soul, come meditate the day, And think how near it stands, When thou must quit this house of clay, And fly to unknown lands. II And you, mine eyes, look down and view The hollow gaping tomb, This gloomy prison waits for you Whene'er the summons come. III O could we die with those that die, And place us in their stead, Then would our spirits learn to fly, And converse with the dead: IV Then should we see the saints above In their own glorious forms, And wonder why our souls should love To dwell with mortal worms. V How we should scorn these clothes of flesh, These fetters and this load! And long for evening to undress, That we may rest with God. VI We should almost forsake our clay Before the summons come, And pray, and wish our souls away To their eternal home. HYMN 62. (C. M.) God the Thunderer; or, the last Judgment and Hell. Made in a great sudden storm of thunder, Aug. 20th, 1697. I Sing to the Lord, ye heavenly hosts, And thou, O earth, adore, Let death and hell thro' all their coasts Stand trembling at his power. II His sounding chariot shakes the sky, He makes the clouds his throne, There all his stores of lightning lie, Till vengeance dart them down. III His nostrils breathe out fiery streams, And from his awful tongue A sovereign voice divides the flames, And thunder roars along. IV Think, O my soul, the dreadful day When this incensed God Shall rend the sky, and burn the sea, And fling his wrath abroad. V What shall the wretch the sinner do? He once defy'd the Lord; But he shall dread the thunderer now, And sink beneath his word. VI Tempests of angry fire shall roll To blast the rebel-worm, And beat upon his naked soul In one eternal storm. HYMN 63. (C. M.) A Funeral Thought. I Hark! from the tombs a doleful sound, My ears attend the cry, ‘Ye living men, come view the ground ‘Where you must shortly lie. II ‘Princes, this clay must be your bed, ‘In spite of all your towers; ‘The tall, the wise, the reverend head ‘Must lie as low as ours.’ III Great God, is this our certain doom? And are we still secure? Still walking downward to our tomb, And yet prepare no more? IV Grant us the powers of quickening grace To fit our souls to fly, Then, when we drop this dying flesh, We'll rise above the sky. HYMN 64. (L. M.) God the Glory and Defence of Sion. I Happy the church, thou sacred place, The seat of thy Creator's grace; Thine holy courts are his abode, Thou earthly palace of our God. II Thy walls are strength, and at thy gates A guard of heavenly warriors waits; Nor shall thy deep foundations move, Fix'd on his counsels and his love. III Thy foes in vain designs engage, Against his throne in vain they rage, Like rising waves, with angry roar, That dash and die upon the shore. IV Then let our souls in Zion dwell Nor fear the wrath of Rome and hell: His arms embrace this happy ground, Like brazen bulwarks built around. V God is our shield, and God our sun; Swift as the fleeting moments run, On us he sheds new beams of grace, And we reflect his brightest praise. HYMN 65. (C. M.) The Hope of Heaven our Support under Trial on Earth. I When I can read my title clear To mansions in the skies, I bid farewell to every fear, And wipe my weeping eyes. II Should earth against my soul engage, And hellish darts be hurl'd, Then I can smile at Satan's rage, And face a frowning world. III Let cares like a wild deluge come, And storms of sorrow fall, May I but safely reach my home, My God, my heaven, my all. IV There shall I bathe my weary soul In seas of heavenly rest, And not a wave of trouble roll Across my peaceful breast. HYMN 66. (C. M.) A Prospect of Heaven makes Death easy. I There is a land of pure delight Where saints immortal reign, Infinite day excludes the night, And pleasures banish pain. II There everlasting spring abides, And never-withering flowers: Death like a narrow sea divides This heavenly land from ours. III Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood Stand dress'd in living green: So to the Jews old Canaan stood, While Jordan roll'd between. IV But timorous mortals start and shrink To cross this narrow sea, And linger shivering on the brink, And fear to launch away. V O! could we make our doubts remove, These gloomy doubts that rise, And see the Canaan that we love, With unbeclouded eyes! VI Could we but climb where Moses stood, And view the landscape o'er, Not Jordan's stream, nor deaths cold flood, Should fright us from the shore. HYMN 67. (C. M.) God's eternal Dominion. I Great God, how infinite art thou! What worthless worms are we! Let the whole race of creatures bow And pay their praise to thee. II Thy throne eternal ages stood, Ere seas or stars were made; Thou art the ever-living God Were all the nations dead. III Nature and time quite naked lie To thine immense survey, From the formation of the sky To the great burning day. IV Eternity with all its years Stands present in thy view; To thee there's nothing old appears, Great God, there's nothing new. V Our lives thro' various scenes are drawn, And vex'd with trifling cares; While thine eternal thought moves on Thine undisturb'd affairs. VI Great God, how infinite art thou! What worthless worms are we! Let the whole race of creatures bow And pay their praise to thee. HYMN 68. (C. M.) The humble Worship of Heaven. I Father, I long, I faint to see The place of thine abode, I'd leave thy earthly courts and flee Up to thy seat, my God! II Here I behold thy distant face, And 'tis a pleasing sight; But to abide in thine embrace Is infinite delight. III I'd part with all the joys of sense To gaze upon thy throne; Pleasure springs fresh for ever thence, Unspeakable, unknown. IV There all the heavenly hosts are seen, In shining ranks they move, And drink immortal vigour in, With wonder and with love. V Then at thy feet with awful fear Th'adoring armies fall; With joy they shrink to nothing there, Before th'eternal All. VI There I would vie with all the host In duty and in bliss, While less than nothing I could boast And vanity Isaiah xl. 17. confess. VII The more thy glories strike mine eyes, The humbler I shall lie; Thus while I sink, my joys shall rise Unmeasurable high. HYMN 69. (C. M.) The Faithfulness of God in his Promises. I Begin, my tongue, some heavenly theme, And speak some boundless thing, The mighty works, or mightier name Of our eternal King. II Tell of his wondrous faithfulness, And sound his power abroad, Sing the sweet promise of his grace, And the performing God. III Proclaim ‘salvation from the Lord ‘For wretched dying men;’ His hand has writ the sacred word With an immortal pen. IV Engrav'd as in eternal brass The mighty promise shines; Nor can the powers of darkness rase Those everlasting lines. V He that can dash whole worlds to death, And make them when he please, He speaks, and that almighty breath Fulfils his great decrees. VI His very word of grace is strong As that which built the skies, The voice that rolls the stars along Speaks all the promises. VII He said, ‘Let the wide heaven be spread,’ And heaven was stretch'd abroad; ‘Abrah'm, I'll be thy God,’ he said, And he was Abrah'm's God. VIII O, might I hear thine heavenly tongue But whisper, ‘Thou art mine;’ Those gentle words should raise my song To notes almost divine. IX How would my leaping heart rejoice And think my heaven secure! I trust the all-creating voice, And faith desires no more. HYMN 70. (L. M.) God's Dominion over the Sea, Psalm cvii. 23, &amp;c. I God of the seas, thy thundering voice Makes all the roaring waves rejoice, And one soft word of thy command Can sink them silent in the sand. II If but a Moses wave thy rod, The sea divides and owns its God; The stormy floods their Maker knew, And let his chosen armies through. III The scaly flocks amidst the sea To thee their Lord a tribute pay; The meanest fish that swims the flood Leaps up, and means a praise to God. IV The larger monsters of the deep, On thy commands attendance keep, By thy permission sport and play, And cleave along their foaming way. V If God his voice of tempest rears Leviathan lies still and fears, Anon he lifts his nostrils high, And spouts the ocean to the sky. VI How is thy glorious power ador'd, Amidst those wat'ry nations, Lord! Yet the bold men that trace the seas, Bold men, refuse their Maker's praise. VII What scenes of miracles they see, And never tune a song to thee! While on the flood they safely ride, They curse the hand that smooths the tide. VIII Anon they plunge in wat'ry graves, And some drink death among the waves: Yet the surviving crew blaspheme, Nor own the God that rescu'd them. IX O for some signal of thine hand, Shake all the seas, Lord, shake the land, Great Judge descend, lest men deny That there's a God that rules the sky. From the 70th to the 108th Hymn, I hope the reader will forgive the neglect of rhyme in the first and third lines of the stanza. HYMN 71. (C. M.) Praise to God from all Creatures. I The glories of my Maker God, My joyful voice shall sing, And call the nations to adore Their Former and their King. II 'Twas his right hand that shap'd our clay, And wrought this human frame, But from his own immediate breath Our nobler spirits came. III We bring our mortal powers to God, And worship with our tongues: We claim some kindred with the skies And join th'angelic songs. IV Let grovelling beasts of every shape, And fowls of every wing, And rocks, and trees, and fires, and seas, Their various tribute bring. V Ye planets, to his honour shine, And wheels of nature roll, Praise him in your unwearied course Around the steady pole. VI The brightness of our Maker's name The wide creation fills, And his unbounded grandeur flies Beyond the heavenly hills. HYMN 72. (C. M.) The Lord's Day; or, the Resurrection of Christ. I Bless'd morning, whose young dawning rays Beheld our rising God, That saw him triumph o'er the dust, And leave his dark abode. II In the cold prison of a tomb, The dead Redeemer lay, Till the revolving skies had brought The third, th'appointed day. III Hell and the grave unite their force To hold our God in vain, The sleeping Conqueror arose, And burst their feeble chain. IV To thy great name, almighty Lord, These sacred hours we pay, And loud hosannas shall proclaim The triumph of the day. V Salvation and immortal praise To our victorious King, Let heaven, and earth, and rocks, and seas, With glad hosannas ring. HYMN 73. (C. M.) Doubts scattered; or, spiritual Joy restored. I Hence from my soul, sad thoughts, begone, And leave me to my joys, My tongue shall triumph in my God, And make a joyful noise. II Darkness and doubts had veil'd my mind, And drown'd my head in tears, Till sovereign grace with shining rays Dispell'd my gloomy fears. III O what immortal joys I felt, And raptures all divine, When Jesus told me, I was his, And my Beloved mine. IV In vain the tempter frights my soul, And breaks my peace in vain, One glimpse, dear Saviour, of thy face, Revives my joys again. HYMN 74. (S. M.) Repentance from a Sense of divine Goodness; or, a Complaint of Ingratitude. I Is this the kind return, And these the thanks we owe? Thus to abuse eternal love Whence all our blessings flow? II To what a stubborn frame Has sin reduc'd our mind! What strange rebellious wretches we, And God as strangely kind! III On us he bids the sun Shed his reviving rays, For us the skies their circles run To lengthen out our days. IV The brutes obey their God, And bow their necks to men, But we more base, more brutish things Reject his easy reign. V Turn, turn us, mighty God, And mould our souls afresh, Break, sovereign grace, these hearts of stone, And give us hearts of flesh. VI Let old ingratitude Provoke our weeping eyes, And hourly as new mercies fall Let hourly thanks arise. HYMN 75. (C. M.) Spiritual and eternal Joys; or, the beatific Sight of Christ. I From thee, my God, my joys shall rise, And run eternal rounds, Beyond the limits of the skies And all created bounds. II The holy triumphs of my soul Shall death itself out-brave, Leave dull mortality behind, And fly beyond the grave. III There, where my blessed Jesus reigns In heaven's unmeasur'd space, I'll spend a long eternity In pleasure and in praise. IV Millions of years my wondering eyes Shall o'er thy beauties rove, And endless ages I'll adore The glories of thy love. V Sweet Jesus, every smile of thine Shall fresh endearments bring, And thousand tastes of new delight From all thy graces spring. VI Haste, my beloved, fetch my soul Up to thy bless'd abode, Fly, for my spirit longs to see My Saviour and my God. HYMN 76. (L. M.) The Resurrection and Ascension of Christ. I Hosanna to the Prince of Light That cloth'd himself in clay, Enter'd the iron gates of death, And tore the bars away. II Death is no more the king of dread Since our Immanuel rose, He took the tyrant's sting away, And spoil'd our hellish foes. III See how the Conqueror mounts aloft, And to his Father flies, With scars of honour in his flesh, And triumph in his eyes. IV There our exalted Saviour reigns, And scatters blessings down, Our Jesus fills the middle seat Of the celestial throne. V Raise your devotion, mortal tongues, To reach his bless'd abode, Sweet be the accents of your songs To our incarnate God. VI Bright angels, strike your loudest strings, Your sweetest voices raise, Let heaven, and all created things, Sound our Immanuel's praise. HYMN 77. (L. M.) The Christian Warfare. I Stand up, my soul, shake off thy fears, And gird the gospel-armour on, March to the gates of endless joy Where thy great Captain-Saviour's gone. II Hell and thy sins resist thy course, But hell and sin are vanquish'd foes, Thy Jesus nail'd them to the cross, And sung the triumph when he rose. III What tho' the prince of darkness rage, And waste the fury of his spite, Eternal chains confine him down To fiery deeps and endless night. IV What tho' thine inward lusts rebel, 'Tis but a struggling gasp for life; The weapons of victorious grace Shall slay thy sins, and end thy strife. V Then let my soul march boldly on, Press forward to the heavenly gate, There peace and joy eternal reign, And glittering robes for conquerors wait. VI There shall I wear a starry crown, And triumph in almighty grace, While all the armies of the skies Join in my glorious Leader's praise. HYMN 78. (C. M.) Redemption by Christ. I When the first parents of our race Rebell'd and lost their God, And the infection of their sin Had tainted all our blood, II Infinite pity touch'd the heart Of the eternal Son, Descending from the heavenly court He left his Father's throne. III Aside the Prince of Glory threw His most divine array, And wrapp'd his Godhead in a veil Of our inferior clay. IV His living power, and dying love Redeem'd unhappy men, And rais'd the ruins of our race To life and God again. V To thee, dear Lord, our flesh and soul We joyfully resign, Bless'd Jesus, take us for thy own, For we are doubly thine. VI Thine honour shall for ever be The business of our days, For ever shall our thankful tongues Speak thy deserved praise. HYMN 79. (C. M.) Praise to the Redeemer. I Plung'd in a gulph of dark despair We wretched sinners lay, Without one cheerful beam of hope, Or spark of glimmering day. II With pitying eyes, the Prince of Grace Beheld our helpless grief, He saw, and (O amazing love!) He ran to our relief. III Down from the shining seats above With joyful haste he fled, Enter'd the grave in mortal flesh, And dwelt among the dead. IV He spoil'd the powers of darkness thus, And brake our iron chains; Jesus has freed our captive souls From everlasting pains. V In vain the baffled prince of hell His cursed projects tries, We that were doom'd his endless slaves Are rais'd above the skies. VI O for this love, let rocks and hills Their lasting silence break, And all harmonious human tongues The Saviour's praises speak. VII Yes, we will praise thee, dearest Lord, Our souls are all on flame, Hosanna round the spacious earth To thine adored name. VIII Angels, assist our mighty joys, Strike all your harps of gold; But when you raise your highest notes His love can ne'er be told. HYMN 80. (S. M.) God's awful Power and Goodness. I O the almighty Lord! How matchless is his power! Tremble, O earth, beneath his word, And all the heavens adore. II Let proud imperious kings Bow low before his throne, Crouch to his feet, ye haughty things, Or he shall tread you down. III Above the skies he reigns, And with amazing blows He deals unsufferable pains On his rebellious foes. IV Yet, everlasting God, We love to speak thy praise; Thy sceptre's equal to thy rod, The sceptre of thy grace. V The arms of mighty love Defend our Sion well, And heavenly mercy walls us round From Babylon and Hell. VI Salvation to the King That sits enthron'd above; Thus we adore the God of might, And bless the God of love. HYMN 81. (C. M.) Our Sin the Cause of Christ's Death. I And now the scales have left mine eyes, Now I begin to see; Oh the curs'd deeds my sins have done! What murderous things they be! II Were these the traitors, dearest Lord, That thy fair body tore? Monsters, that stain'd those heavenly limbs With floods of purple gore? III Was it for crimes that I had done My dearest Lord was slain, When justice seiz'd God's only Son, And put his soul to pain? IV Forgive my guilt, O Prince of Peace, I'll wound my God no more; Hence from my heart, ye sins, be gone, For Jesus I adore. V Furnish me, Lord, with heavenly arms From grace's magazine, And I'll proclaim eternal war With every darling sin. HYMN 82. (C. M.) Redemption and Protection from Spiritual Enemies. I Arise, my soul, my joyful powers, And triumph in my God, Awake, my voice, and loud proclaim His glorious grace abroad. II He rais'd me from the deeps of sin, The gates of gaping hell, And fix'd my standing more secure Than 'twas before I fell. III The arms of everlasting love Beneath my soul he plac'd, And on the rock of ages set My slippery footsteps fast. IV The city of my bless'd abode Is wall'd around with grace, Salvation for a bulwark stands To shield the sacred place. V Satan may vent his sharpest spite, And all his legions roar, Almighty mercy guards my life, And bounds his raging power. VI Arise, my soul, awake, my voice, And tunes of pleasure sing, Loud hallelujahs shall address My Saviour and my King. HYMN 83. (C. M.) The Passion and Exaltation of Christ. I Thus saith the Ruler of the skies, ‘Awake, my dreadful sword; ‘Awake, my wrath, and smite the man, ‘My fellow,’ saith the Lord. II Vengeance receiv'd the dread command, And armed down she flies, Jesus submits t'his Father's hand, And bows his head and dies. III But oh! the wisdom and the grace That join with vengeance now! He dies to save our guilty race, And yet he rises too. IV A person so divine was he Who yielded to be slain, That he could give his soul away, And take his life again. V Live, glorious Lord, and reign on high, Let every nation sing, And angels sound with endless joy The Saviour and the King. HYMN 84. (S. M.) The same. [Come, all harmonious tongues] I Come, all harmonious tongues, Your noblest music bring, 'Tis Christ the everlasting God, And Christ the man we sing. II Tell how he took our flesh To take away our guilt, Sing the dear drops of sacred blood That hellish monsters spilt. III Alas! the cruel spear Went deep into his side, And the rich flood of purple gore Their murderous weapons dy'd. IV The waves of swelling grief Did o'er his bosom roll, And mountains of almighty wrath Lay heavy on his soul. V Down to the shades of death He bow'd his awful head, Yet he arose to live and reign When death itself is dead. VI No more the bloody spear, The cross and nails no more; For hell itself shakes at his name, And all the heavens adore. VII There the Redeemer sits High on the Father's throne; The Father lays his vengeance by, And smiles upon his Son. VIII There his full glories shine With uncreated rays, And bless his saints and angels eyes To everlasting days. HYMN 85. (C. M.) Sufficiency of Pardon. I Why does your face, ye humble souls, Those mournful colours wear? What doubts are these that waste your faith, And nourish your despair? II What tho' your numerous sins exceed The stars that fill the skies, And aiming at th'eternal throne Like pointed mountains rise? III What tho' your mighty guilt beyond The wide creation swell, And has its curs'd foundations laid Low as the deeps of hell? IV See here an endless ocean flows Of never-failing grace, Behold a dying Saviour's veins The sacred flood increase: V It rises high and drowns the hills, 'T has neither shore nor bound: Nor if we search to find our sins Our sins can ne'er be found. VI Awake, our hearts, adore the grace That buries all our faults, And pardoning blood that swells above Our follies and our thoughts. HYMN 86. (C. M.) Freedom from Sin and Misery in Heaven. I Our sins, alas! how strong they be! And like a violent sea They break our duty, Lord, to thee, And hurry us away. II The waves of trouble how they rise! How loud the tempests roar! But death shall land our weary souls Safe on the heavenly shore. III There to fulfil his sweet commands Our speedy feet shall move, No sin shall clog our winged zeal, Or cool our burning love. IV There shall we sit, and sing, and tell The wonders of his grace, Till heavenly raptures fire our hearts, And smile in every face. V For ever his dear sacred name Shall dwell upon our tongue, And Jesus and Salvation be The close of every song. HYMN 87. (C. M.) The divine Glories above our Reason. I How wondrous great, how glorious bright Must our Creator be, Who dwells amidst the dazzling light Of vast infinity! II Our soaring spirits upward rise Tow'rd the celestial throne, Fain would we see the blessed Three, And the almighty One. III Our reason stretches all its wings, And climbs above the skies; But still how far beneath thy feet Our grovelling reason lies! IV Lord, here we bend our humble souls, And awfully adore, For the weak pinions of our mind Can stretch a thought no more. V Thy glories infinitely rise Above our labouring tongue; In vain the highest seraph tries To form an equal song. VI In humble notes our faith adores The great mysterious King, While angels strain their nobler powers, And sweep th'immortal string. HYMN 88. (C. M.) Salvation. I Salvation! O, the joyful sound! 'Tis pleasure to our ears; A sovereign balm for every wound, A cordial for our fears. II Bury'd in sorrow and in sin, At hell's dark door we lay, But we arise by grace divine To see a heavenly day. III Salvation! let the echo fly The spacious earth around, While all the armies of the sky Conspire to raise the sound. HYMN 89. (C. M.) Christ's Victory over Satan. I Hosanna to our conquering King! The prince of darkness flies, His troops rush headlong down to hell Like lightning from the skies. II There bound in chains the lions roar, And fright the rescu'd sheep, But heavy bars confine their power And malice to the deep. III Hosanna to our conquering King, All hail, incarnate love! Ten thousand songs and glories wait To crown thy head above. IV Thy victories and thy deathless fame Through the wide world shall run, And everlasting ages sing The triumphs thou hast won. HYMN 90. (C. M.) Faith in Christ for Pardon and Sanctification. I How sad our state by nature is! Our sin how deep it stains! And Satan binds our captive minds Fast in his slavish chains. II But there's a voice of sovereign grace Sounds from the sacred word, ‘Ho, ye despairing sinners, come, ‘And trust upon the Lord.’ III My soul obeys th'almighty call, And runs to this relief, I would believe thy promise, Lord, O! help my unbelief. IV To the dear fountain of thy blood, Incarnate God, I fly, Here let me wash my spotted soul From crimes of deepest dye. V Stretch out thine arm, victorious King, My reigning sins subdue, Drive the old dragon from his seat, With all his hellish crew. VI A guilty, weak, and helpless worm, On thy kind arms I fall: Be thou my strength and righteousness, My Jesus, and my all. HYMN 91. (C. M.) The Glory of Christ in Heaven. I O the delights, the heavenly joys, The glories of the place Where Jesus sheds the brightest beams Of his o'erflowing grace! II Sweet majesty and awful love Sit smiling on his brow, And all the glorious ranks above At humble distance bow. III Princes to his imperial name Bend their bright sceptres down, Dominions, thrones, and powers rejoice To see him wear the crown. IV Archangels sound his lofty praise Through every heavenly street, And lay their highest honours down Submissive at his feet. V Those soft, those blessed feet of his That once rude iron tore, High on a throne of light they stand, And all the saints adore. VI His head, the dear majestic head That cruel thorns did wound, See what immortal glories shine, And circle it around. VII This is the man, th'exalted man, Whom we unseen adore; But when our eyes behold his face, Our hearts shall love him more. VIII Lord, how our souls are all on fire To see thy bless'd abode, Our tongues rejoice in tunes of praise To our incarnate God. IX And whilst our faith enjoys this sight, We long to leave our clay, And wish thy fiery chariots, Lord, To fetch our souls away. HYMN 92. (C. M.) The Church saved, and her Enemies disappointed. Composed the 5th of November, 1694. I Shout to the Lord, and let our joys Through the whole nation run; Ye British skies, resound the noise Beyond the rising sun. II Thee, mighty God, our souls admire, Thee our glad voices sing, And join with the celestial choir To praise the eternal King. III Thy power the whole creation rules, And on the starry skies Sits smiling at the weak designs Thine envious foes devise. IV Thy scorn derides their feeble rage, And with an awful frown Flings vast confusion on their plots, And shakes their Babel down. V Their secret fires in caverns lay, And we the sacrifice: But gloomy caverns strove in vain To 'scape all-searching eyes. VI Their dark designs were all reveal'd, Their treasons all betray'd: Praise to the God that broke the snare Their cursed hands had laid. VII In vain the busy sons of hell Still new rebellions try, Their souls shall pine with envious rage, And vex away and die. VIII Almighty grace defends our land From their malicious power, Let Britain with united songs Almighty grace adore. HYMN 93. (S. M.) God all, and in all, Psalm lxxiii. 25. I My God, my life, my love, To thee, to thee, I call, I cannot live if thou remove, For thou art all in all. II Thy shining grace can cheer This dungeon where I dwell; 'Tis paradise when thou art here, If thou depart, 'tis hell. III The smilings of thy face, How amiable they are! 'Tis heaven to rest in thine embrace, And no where else but there. IV To thee, and thee alone, The angels owe their bliss; They sit around thy gracious throne, And dwell where Jesus is. V Not all the harps above Can make a heavenly place, If God his residence remove, Or but conceal his face. VI Nor earth, nor all the sky Can one delight afford, No, not a drop of real joy Without thy presence, Lord. VII Thou art the sea of love, Where all my pleasures roll, The circle where my passions move, And centre of my soul. VIII To thee my spirits fly With infinite desire, And yet how far from thee I lie! Dear Jesus raise me higher! HYMN 94. (C. M.) God my only Happiness, Psalm lxxiii. 25. I My God, my portion, and my love, My everlasting all, I've none but thee in heaven above, Or on this earthly ball. II What empty things are all the skies, And this inferior clod! There's nothing here deserves my joys, There's nothing like my God. III In vain the bright, the burning sun Scatters his feeble light; 'Tis thy sweet beams create my noon; If thou withdraw, 'tis night. IV And whilst upon my restless bed, Amongst the shades I roll, If my Redeemer shew his head, 'Tis morning with my soul. V To thee we owe our wealth, and friends, And health, and safe abode; Thanks to thy name for meaner things, But they are not my God. VI How vain a toy is glittering wealth, If once compar'd to thee; Or what's my safety, or my health, Or all my friends to me? VII Were I possessor of the earth, And call'd the stars my own, Without thy graces and thyself, I were a wretch undone. VIII Let others stretch their arms like seas, And grasp in all the shore, Grant me the visits of thy face, And I desire no more. HYMN 95. (C. M.) Look on him whom they pierced, and mourn. I Infinite grief! amazing woe! Behold my bleeding Lord: Hell and the Jews conspir'd his death, And us'd the Roman sword. II Oh, the sharp pangs of smarting pain My dear Redeemer bore, When knotty whips and ragged thorns His sacred body tore! III But knotty whips and ragged thorns In vain do I accuse, In vain I blame the Roman bands, And the more spiteful Jews. IV 'Twere you, my sins, my cruel sins, His chief tormentors were; Each of my crimes became a nail, And unbelief the spear. V 'Twere you that pull'd the vengeance down Upon his guiltless head: Break, break, my heart, Oh burst mine eyes, And let my sorrows bleed. VI Strike, mighty grace, my flinty soul Till melting waters flow, And deep repentance drown mine eyes In undissembled woe. HYMN 96. (C. M.) Distinguishing Love; or, Angels punished, and Man saved. I Down headlong from their native skies The rebel angels fell, And thunderbolts of flaming wrath Pursu'd them deep to hell. II Down from the top of earthly bliss Rebellious man was hurl'd; And Jesus stoop'd beneath the grave To reach a sinking world. III O love of infinite degree! Unmeasurable grace! Must heaven's eternal darling die To save a traitorous race? IV Must angels sink for ever down, And burn in quenchless fire, While God forsakes his shining throne To raise us wretches higher? V O for this love let earth and skies With hallejahs ring, And the full choir of human tongue All hallelujah sing. HYMN 97. (L. M.) The same. [From heaven the sinning angels fell] I From heaven the sinning angels fell, And wrath and darkness chain'd them down; But man, vile man, forsook his bliss, And mercy lifts him to a crown. II Amazing work of sovereign grace That could distinguish rebels so! Our guilty treasons call'd aloud For everlasting fetters too. III To thee, to thee, almighty love, Our souls, ourselves, our all we pay: Millions of tongues shall sound thy praise On the bright hills of heavenly day. HYMN 98. (C. M.) Hardness of Heart complained of. I My heart, how dreadful hard it is! How heavy here it lies, Heavy and cold within my breast, Just like a rock of ice! II Sin like a raging tyrant sits Upon this flinty throne, And every grace lies bury'd deep Beneath this heart of stone. III How seldom do I rise to God, Or taste the joys above! This mountain presses down my faith, And chills my flaming love. IV When smiling mercy courts my soul With all its heavenly charms, This stubborn, this relentless thing Would thrust it from my arms. V Against the thunders of thy word Rebellious I have stood, My heart it shakes not at the wrath And terrors of a God. VI Dear Saviour, steep this rock of mine In thine own crimson sea: None but a bath of blood divine Can melt the flint away. HYMN 99. (C. M.) The Book of God's Decrees. I Let the whole race of creatures lie Abas'd before their God: Whate'er his sovereign voice hath form'd He governs with a nod. II Ten thousand ages ere the skies Were into motion brought, All the long years and worlds to come Stood present to his thought. III There's not a sparrow or a worm But's found in his decrees; He raises monarchs to their thrones, And sinks them as he please. IV If light attends the course I run, 'Tis he provides those rays; And 'tis his hand that hides my sun, If darkness cloud my days. V Yet I would not be much concern'd, Nor vainly long to see The volume of his deep decrees, What months are writ for me. VI When he reveals the book of life, O may I read my name Amongst the chosen of his love, The followers of the Lamb! HYMN 100. (L. M.) The Presence of Christ is the Life of my Soul. I How full of anguish is the thought, How it distracts and tears my heart, If God at last my sovereign judge, Should frown, and bid my soul, ‘Depart!’ II Lord, when I quit this earthly stage, Where shall I fly but to thy breast? For I have sought no other home; For I have learn't no other rest. III I cannot live contented here, Without some glimpses of thy face; And heaven without thy presence there Would be a dark and tiresome place. IV When earthly cares engross the day, And hold my thoughts aside from thee, The shining hours of cheerful light Are long and tedious years to me. V And if no evening visit's paid Between my Saviour and my soul, How dull the night! how sad the shade! How mournfully the minutes roll! VI This flesh of mine might learn as soon To live, yet part with all my blood; To breathe when vital air is gone, Or thrive and grow without my food. VII Christ is my light, my life, my care, My blessed hope, my heavenly prize, Dearer than all my passions are, My limbs, my bowels, or my eyes. VIII The strings that twine about my heart, Tortures and racks may tear them off, But they can never, never part With their dear hold of Christ my love. IX My God! and can an humble child That loves thee with a flame so high, Be ever from thy face exil'd Without the pity of thine eye? X Impossible—For thine own hands Have ty'd my heart so fast to thee; And in thy book the promise stands, That where thou art thy friends must be. HYMN 101. (C. M.) The World's three chief Temptations. I When in the light of faith divine We look on things below, Honour, and gold, and sensual joy, How vain and dangerous too! II Honour's a puff of noisy breath; Yet men expose their blood, And venture everlasting death To gain that airy good III Whilst others starve the nobler mind, And feed on shining dust, They rob the serpent of his food T'indulge a sordid lust. IV The pleasures that allure our sense Are dangerous snares to souls; There's but a drop of flattering sweet, And dash'd with bitter bowls. V God is mine all-sufficient good, My portion and my choice; In him my vast desires are fill'd, And all my powers rejoice VI In vain the world accosts my ear, And tempts my heart anew; I cannot buy your bliss so dear, Nor part with heaven for you. HYMN 102. (L. M.) A happy Resurrection. I No, I'll repine at death no more, But with a cheerful gasp resign To the cold dungeon of the grave These dying withering limbs of mine. II Let worms devour my wasting flesh, And crumble all my bones to dust, My God shall raise my frame anew At the revival of the just. III Break, sacred morning, thro' the skies, Bring that delightful, dreadful day, Cut short the hours, dear Lord, and come, Thy lingering wheels, how long they stay! IV Our weary spirits faint to see The light of thy returning face, And hear the language of those lips Where God has shed his richest grace. V Haste then upon the wings of love, Rouse all the pious sleeping clay, That we may join in heavenly joys, And sing the triumph of the day. HYMN 103. (C. M.) Christ's Commission, John iii. 16, 17. I Come, happy souls, approach your God With new melodious songs; Come, render to almighty grace The tribute of your tongues. II So strange, so boundless was the love That pity'd dying men, The Father sent his equal Son To give them life again. III Thy hands, dear Jesus, were not arm'd With a revenging rod, No hard commission to perform The vengeance of a God. IV But all was mercy, all was mild, And wrath forsook the throne, When Christ on the kind errand came, And brought salvation down. V Here, sinners, you may heal your wounds, And wipe your sorrows dry; Trust in the mighty Saviour's name, And you shall never die. VI See, dearest Lord, our willing souls Accept thine offer'd grace; We bless the great Redeemer's love, And give the Father praise. HYMN 104. (S. M.) The same. [Raise your triumphant songs] I Raise your triumphant songs To an immortal tune, Let the wide earth resound the deeds Celestial grace has done. II Sing how eternal love Its chief beloved chose, And bid him raise our wretched race From their abyss of woes. III His hand no thunder bears, Nor terror clothes his brow, No bolts to drive our guilty souls To fiercer flames below. IV 'Twas mercy fill'd the throne, And wrath stood silent by, When Christ was sent with pardons down To rebels doom'd to die. V Now, sinners, dry your tears, Let hopeless sorrow cease; Bow to the sceptre of his love, And take the offer'd peace. VI Lord, we obey thy call; We lay an humble claim To the salvation thou hast brought, And love and praise thy name. HYMN 105. (C. M.) Repentance flowing from the Patience of God, I And are we wretches yet alive? And do we yet rebel? 'Tis boundless, 'tis amazing love That bears us up from hell! II The burden of our weighty guilt Would sink us down to flames, And threatening vengeance rolls above To crush our feeble frames. III Almighty goodness cries, ‘Forbear;’ And straight the thunder stays; And dare we now provoke his wrath, And weary out his grace? IV Lord, we have long abus'd thy love, Too long indulg'd our sin; Our aching hearts e'en bleed to see What rebels we have been. V No more, ye lusts, shall ye command, No more will we obey; Stretch out. O God, thy conquering hand, And drive thy foes away. HYMN 106. (C. M.) Repentance at the Cross. I Oh, if my soul was form'd for woe, How would I vent my sighs! Repentance should like rivers flow From both my streaming eyes. II 'Twas for my sins my dearest Lord Hung on the cursed tree, And groan'd away a dying life For thee, my soul, for thee. III O how I hate those lusts of mine That crucify'd my God, Those sins that pierc'd and nail'd his flesh Fast to the fatal wood! IV Yes, my Redeemer, they shall die, My heart has so decreed, Nor will I spare the guilty things That made my Saviour bleed. V Whilst with a melting broken heart My murder'd Lord I view, I'll raise revenge against my sins, And slay the murderers too. HYMN 107. (C. M.) The everlasting Absence of God intolerable. I That awful day will surely come, Th'appointed hour makes haste, When I must stand before my Judge, And pass the solemn test. II Thou lovely chief of all my joys; Thou sovereign of my heart, How could I bear to hear thy voice Pronounce the sound, ‘Depart?’ III The thunder of that dismal word Would so torment my ear, 'Twould tear my soul asunder, Lord, With most tormenting fear. IV What, to be banish'd for my life, And yet forbid to die! To linger in eternal pain, Yet death for ever fly! V Oh, wretched state of deep despair, To see my God remove, And fix my doleful station where I must not taste his love. VI Jesus, I throw my arms around, And hang upon thy breast; Without a gracious smile from thee My spirit cannot rest. VII O tell me that my worthless name Is graven on thy hands; Shew me some promise in thy book Where my salvation stands! VIII Give me one kind assuring word To sink my fears again; And cheerfully my soul shall wait Her threescore years and ten. HYMN 108. (C. M.) Access to the Throne of Grace by a Mediator. I Come let us lift our joyful eyes Up to the courts above, And smile to see our Father there Upon a throne of love. II Once 'twas a seat of dreadful wrath, And shot devouring flame; Our God appear'd consuming fire, And vengeance was his name. III Rich were the drops of Jesus' blood That calm'd his frowning face, That sprinkled o'er the burning throne, And turn'd the wrath to grace. IV Now we may bow before his feet, And venture near the Lord; No fiery cherub guards his seat, Nor double flaming sword. V The peaceful gates of heavenly bliss Are open'd by the Son; High let us raise our notes of praise, And reach the almighty throne. VI To thee ten thousand thanks we bring, Great Advocate on high: And glory to th'Eternal King That lays his fury by. HYMN 109. (L. M.) The Darkness of Providence. I Lord, we adore thy vast designs, The obscure abyss of providence, Too deep to sound with mortal lines, Too dark to view with feeble sense. II Now thou arrayst thine awful face In angry frowns, without a smile; We through the cloud believe thy grace, Secure of thy compassion still. III Through seas and storms of deep distress We sail by faith and not by sight; Faith guides us in the wilderness Through all the briars and the night. IV Dear Father, if thy lifted rod Resolve to scourge us here below, Still we must lean upon our God, Thine arm shall bear us safely through. HYMN 110. (S. M.) Triumph over Death in Hope of the Resurrection. I And must this body die? This mortal frame decay? And must these active limbs of mine Lie mouldering in the clay? II Corruption, earth, and worms, Shall but refine this flesh, Till my triumphant spirit comes To put it on afresh. III God my Redeemer lives, And often from the skies Looks down and watches all my dust Till he shall bid it rise. IV Array'd in glorious grace Shall these vile bodies shine, And every shape and every face Look heavenly and divine. V These lively hopes we owe To Jesus' dying love; We would adore his grace below, And sing his power above. VI Dear Lord, accept the praise Of these our humble songs, Till tunes of nobler sound we raise With our immortal tongues. HYMN 111. (C. M.) Thanksgiving for Victory; or, God's Dominion and our Deliverance. I Zion rejoice, and Judah sing; The Lord assumes his throne; Let Britain own the heavenly King, And make his glories known. II The great, the wicked, and the proud, From their high seats are hurl'd; Jehovah rides upon a cloud, And thunders through the world. III He reigns upon the eternal hills, Distributes mortal crowns, Empires are fix'd beneath his smiles, And totter at his frowns. IV Navies that rule the ocean wide Are vanquish'd by his breath; And legions arm'd with power and pride Descend to watery death. V Let tyrants make no more pretence To vex our happy land; Jehovah's name is our defence, Our buckler is his hand. VI Long may the King our sovereign live To rule us by his word; And all the honours he can give Be offer'd to the Lord. HYMN 112. (L. M.) Angels ministring to Christ and Saints. I Great God, to what a glorious height Hast thou advanc'd the Lord thy Son! Angels, in all their robes of light, Are made the servants of his throne. II Before his feet their armies wait, And swift as flames of fire they move To manage his affairs of state, In works of vengeance or of love. III His orders run through all their hosts, Legions descend at his command To shield and guard the British coasts When foreign rage invades our land. IV Now they are sent to guide our feet Up to the gates of thine abode, Through all the dangers that we meet In travelling the heavenly road. V Lord, when I leave this mortal ground, And thou shalt bid me rise and come, Send a beloved angel down Safe to conduct my spirit home. HYMN 113. (C. M.) The same. [The majesty of Solomon!] I The majesty of Solomon! How glorious to behold The servants waiting round his throne, The ivory and the gold! II But, mighty God, thy palace shines With far superior beams; Thine angel guards are swift as winds, Thy ministers are flames. III Soon as thine only Son had made His entrance on this earth, A shining army downward fled To celebrate his birth. IV And when oppress'd with pains and fears On the cold ground he lies, Behold a heavenly form appears T'allay his agonies. V Now to the hands of Christ our King Are all their legions given; They wait upon his saints, and bring His chosen heirs to heaven. VI Pleasure and praise run through their host To see a sinner turn; Then Satan has a captive lost, And Christ a subject born. VII But there's an hour of brighter joy When he his angels sends Obstinate rebels to destroy, And gather in his friends. VIII O! could I say, without a doubt, There shall my soul be found, Then let the great archangel shout, And the last trumpet sound. HYMN 114. (C. M.) Christ's Death, Victory, and Dominion. I I sing my Saviour's wondrous death; He conquer'd when he fell: ‘'Tis finish'd,’ said his dying breath, And shook the gates of hell. II ‘'Tis finish'd,’ our Immanuel cries, The dreadful work is done; Hence shall his sovereign throne arise, His kingdom is begun. III His cross a sure foundation laid For glory and renown, When thro' the regions of the dead He pass'd to reach the crown. IV Exalted at his Father's side Sits our victorious Lord; To heaven and hell his hands divide The vengeance or reward. V The saints from his propitious eye Await their several crowns, And all the sons of darkness fly The terror of his frowns. HYMN 115. (C. M.) God the Avenger of his Saints; or, his Kingdom supreme. I High as the heavens above the ground Reigns the Creator, God; Wide as the whole creation's bound Extends his awful rod. II Let princes of exalted state To him ascribe their crown, Render their homage at his feet, And cast their glories down. III Know that his kingdom is supreme, Your lofty thoughts are vain; He calls you gods, that awful name, But ye must die like men. IV Then let the sovereigns of the globe Nor dare to vex the just; He puts on vengeance like a robe, And treads the worms to dust. V Ye judges of the earth, be wise, And think on heaven with fear; The meanest saint that you despise Has an avenger there. HYMN 116. (C. M.) Mercies and Thanks. I How can I sink with such a prop As my eternal God, Who bears the earth's huge pillars up, And spreads the heavens abroad? II How can I die while Jesus lives, Who rose and left the dead? Pardon and grace my soul receives From mine exalted head. III All that I am, and all I have Shall be for ever thine, Whate'er my duty bids me give, My cheerful hands resign. VI Yet if I might make some reserve, And duty did not call, I love my God with zeal so great That I should give him all. HYMN 117. (L. M.) Living and dying with God present. I I cannot bear thine absence, Lord, My life expires if thou depart; Be thou, my heart, still near my God, And thou, my God, be near my heart. II I was not born for earth and sin, Nor can I live on things so vile; Yet I would stay my Father's time, And hope and wait for heaven awhile. III Then, dearest Lord, in thine embrace Let me resign my fleeting breath, And with a smile upon my face Pass the important hour of death. HYMN 118. (L. M.) The Priesthood of Christ. I Blood has a voice to pierce the skies, Revenge, the blood of Abel cries; But the dear stream when Christ was slain Speaks peace as loud from every vein. II Pardon and peace from God on high, Behold he lays his vengeance by, And rebels that deserv'd his sword, Become the favourites of the Lord. III To Jesus let our praises rise Who gave his life a sacrifice; Now he appears before his God, And for our pardon pleads his blood. HYMN 119. (C. M.) The Holy Scriptures. I Laden with guilt, and full of fears, I fly to thee, my Lord, And not a glimpse of hope appears But in thy written word. II The volume of my Father's grace Does all my griefs assuage: Here I behold my Saviour's face Almost in every page. III This is the field were hidden lies The pearl of price unknown, That merchant is divinely wise, Who makes the pearl his own. IV Here consecrated water flows To quench my thirst of sin; Here the fair tree of knowledge grows, Nor danger dwells therein. V This is the judge that ends the strife, Where wit and reason fail; My guide to everlasting life Through all this gloomy vale. VI O may thy counsels, mighty God, My roving feet command; Nor I forsake the happy road That leads to thy right hand. HYMN 120. (S. M.) The Law and Gospel joined in Scripture. I The Lord declares his will, And keeps the world in awe; Amidst the smoke on Sinai's hill Breaks out his fiery law. II The Lord reveals his face, And smiling from above Sends down the gospel of his grace, Th'epistles of his love. III These sacred words impart Our Maker's just commands; The pity of his melting heart, And vengeance of his hands. IV Hence we awake our fear, We draw our comfort hence; The arms of grace are treasur'd here, And armour of defence. V We learn Christ crucify'd, And here behold his blood; All arts and knowledges beside Will do us little good. VI We read the heavenly word, We take the offer'd grace, Obey the statutes of the Lord, And trust his promises. VII In vain shall Satan rage Against a book divine; Where wrath and lightning guard the page, Where beams of mercy shine. HYMN 121. (L. M.) The Law and Gospel distinguished. I The law commands, and makes us know What duties to our God we owe; But 'tis the gospel must reveal Where lies our strength to do his will. II The law discovers guilt and sin, And shews how vile our hearts have been; Only the gospel can express Forgiving love and cleansing grace. III What curses doth the law denounce Against the man that fails but once! But in the gospel Christ appears Pardoning the guilt of numerous years. IV My soul, no more attempt to draw Thy life and comfort from the law, Fly to the hope the gospel gives; The man that trusts the promise lives. HYMN 122. (L. M.) Retirement and Meditation. I My God, permit me not to be A stranger to myself and thee; Amidst a thousand thoughts I rove Forgetful of my highest love. II Why should my passions mix with earth, And thus debase my heavenly birth? Why should I cleave to things below, And let my God, my Saviour go. III Call me away from flesh and sense, One sovereign word can draw me thence; I would obey the voice divine, And all inferior joys resign. IV Be earth with all her scenes withdrawn, Let noise and vanity be gone; In secret silence of the mind My heaven, and there my God I find. HYMN 123. (L. M.) The Benefit of public Ordinances. I Away from every mortal care, Away from earth our souls retreat; We leave this worthless world afar, And wait and worship near thy seat. II Lord, in the temple of thy grace We see thy feet, and we adore; We gaze upon thy lovely face, And learn the wonders of thy power. III While here our various wants we mourn, United groans ascend on high, And prayer bears a quick return Of blessings in variety. IV If Satan rage and sin grow strong, Here we receive some cheering word; We gird the gospel-armour on To fight the battles of the Lord. V Or if our spirit faints and dies, (Our conscience gall'd with inward stings) Here doth the righteous Sun arise With healing beams beneath his wings. VI Father, my soul would still abide Within thy temple, near thy side; But if my feet must hence depart Still keep thy dwelling in my heart. HYMN 124. (C. M.) Moses Aaron and Joshua. I 'Tis not the law of ten commands On holy Sinai given, Or sent to men by Moses' hands, Can bring us safe to heaven. II 'Tis not the blood which Aaron spilt, Nor smoke of sweetest smell, Can buy a pardon for our guilt, Or save our souls from hell. III Aaron the priest resigns his breath At God's immediate will; And in the desert yields to death Upon th'appointed hill. IV And thus on Jordan's yonder side The tribes of Israel stand, While Moses bow'd his head and dy'd Short of the promis'd land. V Israel rejoice, now Joshua Joshua, the same with Jesus, and signifies a Saviour. leads, He'll bring your tribes to rest; So far the Saviour's name exceeds The ruler and the priest. HYMN 125. (L. M.) Faith and Repentance; Unbelief and Impenitence. I Life and immortal joys are given To souls that mourn the sins they've done, Children of wrath made heirs of heaven By faith in God's eternal Son. II Wo to the wretch that never felt The inward pangs of pious grief, But adds to all his crying guilt The stubborn sin of unbelief. III The law condemns the rebel dead, Under the wrath of God he lies, He seals the curse on his own head, And with a double vengeance dies. HYMN 126. (C. M.) God glorified in the Gospel. I The Lord, descending from above, Invites his children near, While power and truth and boundless love Display their glories here. II Here in thy gospel's wondrous frame Fresh wisdom we pursue; A thousand angels learn thy name Beyond whate'er they knew. III Thy name is writ in fairest lines, Thy wonders here we trace; Wisdom thro' all the mystery shines, And shines in Jesus' face. IV The law its best obedience owes To our incarnate God; And thy revenging justice shows Its honours in his blood. V But still the lustre of thy grace Our warmer thoughts employs, Gilds the whole scene with brighter rays, And more exalts our joys. HYMN 127. (L. M.) Circumcision and Baptism. (Written only for those who practise the Baptism of Infants.) I Thus did the sons of Abrah'm pass Under the bloody seal of grace; The young disciples bore the yoke, Till Christ the painful bondage broke. II By milder ways doth Jesus prove His Father's covenant, and his love; He seals to saints his glorious grace, And not forbids their infant-race. III Their seed is sprinkled with his blood, Their children set apart for God, His spirit on their offspring shed, Like water pour'd upon the head. IV Let every saint with cheerful voice In this large covenant rejoice; Young children in their early days Shall give the God of Abrah'm praise. HYMN 128. (C. M.) Corrupt Nature from Adam. I Bless'd with the joy of innocence Adam, our father, stood, Till he debas'd his soul to sense, And eat th'unlawful food. II Now we are born a sensual race, To sinful joys inclin'd; Reason has lost its native place, And flesh enslaves the mind. III While flesh and sense and passion reigns, Sin is the sweetest good: We fancy music in our chains, And so forget the load. IV Great God renew our ruin'd frame, Our broken powers restore, Inspire us with a heavenly flame, And flesh shall reign no more. V Eternal Spirit, write thy law Upon our inward parts, And let the second Adam draw His image on our hearts. HYMN 129. (L. M.) We walk by Faith, not by Sight. I 'Tis by the faith of joys to come We walk thro' deserts dark as night: Till we arrive at heaven our home, Faith is our guide, and faith our light. II The want of sight she well supplies, She makes the pearly gates appear; Far into distant worlds she pries, And brings eternal glories near. III Cheerful we tread the desert thro', While faith inspires a heavenly ray, Tho' lions roar, and tempests blow, And rocks and dangers fill the way. IV So Abrah'm by divine command Left his own house to walk with God; His faith beheld the promis'd land, And fir'd his zeal along the road. HYMN 130. (C. M.) The new Creation. I Attend, while God's exalted Son Doth his own glories shew; ‘Behold I sit upon my throne ‘Creating all things new. II ‘Nature and sin are pass'd away, ‘And the old Adam dies; ‘My hands a new foundation lay, ‘See the new world arise. III ‘I'll be a sun of righteousness ‘To the new heavens I make; ‘None but the new-born heirs of grace ‘My glories shall partake.’ IV Mighty Redeemer, set me free From my whole state of sin; O make my soul alive to thee, Create new powers within. V Renew mine eyes, and form mine ears, And mould my heart afresh; Give me new passions, joys and fears, And turn the stone to flesh. VI Far from the regions of the dead, From sin, and earth, and hell, In the new world that grace has made I would for ever dwell. HYMN 131. (L. M.) The excellency of the Christian Religion. I Let everlasting glories crown Thy head, my Saviour and my Lord; Thy hands have brought salvation down, And writ the blessings in thy word. II What if we trace the globe around, And search from Britain to Japan, There shall be no religion found So just to God, so safe for man. III In vain the trembling conscience seeks Some solid ground to rest upon; With long despair the spirit breaks, Till we apply to Christ alone. IV How well thy blessed truths agree! How wise and holy thy commands! Thy promises how firm they be! How firm our hope and comfort stands! V Not the feign'd fields of heathenish bliss Could raise such pleasures in the mind; Nor does the Turkish paradise Pretend to joys so well refin'd. VI Should all the forms that men devise Assault my faith with treacherous art, I'd call them vanity and lies, And bind the gospel to my heart. HYMN 132. (C. M.) The Offices of Christ. I We bless the Prophet of the Lord, That comes with truth and grace; Jesus, thy Spirit and thy word Shall lead us in thy ways. II We reverence our High Priest above, Who offer'd up his blood, And lives to carry on his love, By pleading with our God. III We honour our exalted King, How sweet are his commands! He guards our souls from hell and sin By his almighty hands. IV Hosanna to his glorious name, Who saves by different ways; His mercies lay a sovereign claim To our immortal praise. HYMN 133. (L. M.) The Operations of the Holy Spirit. I Eternal Spirit! we confess And sing the wonders of thy grace; Thy power conveys our blessings down From God the Father and the Son. II Enlighten'd by thine heavenly ray, Our shades and darkness turn to day; Thine inward teachings make us know Our danger and our refuge too. III Thy power and glory works within, And breaks the chains of raging sin, Doth our imperious lusts subdue, And forms our wretched hearts anew. IV The troubled conscience knows thy voice, Thy cheering words awake our joys; Thy words allay the stormy wind; And calm the surges of the mind. HYMN 134. (C. M.) Circumcision abolished. I The promise was divinely free, Extensive was the grace; ‘I will the God of Abrah'm be, ‘And of his numerous race.’ II He said; and with a bloody seal Confirm'd the words he spoke; Long did the sons of Abrah'm feel The sharp and painful yoke. III Till God's own Son, descending low, Gave his own flesh to bleed; And gentiles taste the blessing now, From the hard bondage freed. IV The God of Abrah'm claims our praise, His promises endure, And Christ the Lord in gentler ways Makes the salvation sure. HYMN 135. (L. M.) Types and Prophecies of Christ. I Behold the woman's promis'd seed! Behold the great Messiah come! Behold the prophets all agreed To give him the superior room! II Abrah'm the saint rejoic'd of old When visions of the Lord he saw; Moses the man of God foretold This great fulfiller of his law. III The types bore witness to his name, Obtain'd their chief design, and ceas'd; The incense and the bleeding lamb, The ark, the altar, and the priest. IV Predictions in abundance meet To join their blessings on his head; Jesus, we worship at thy feet, And nations own the promis'd seed. HYMN 136. (L. M.) Miracles at the Birth of Christ. I The King of Glory sends his Son To make his entrance on this earth! Behold the midnight bright as noon, And heavenly hosts declare his birth! II About the young Redeemer's head What wonders and what glories meet! An unknown star arose and led The eastern sages to his feet. III Simeon and Anna both conspire The infant-saviour to proclaim; Inward they felt the sacred fire, And bless'd the babe, and own'd his name. IV Let Jews and Greeks blaspheme aloud, And treat the holy child with scorn; Our souls adore th'eternal God Who condescended to be born. HYMN 137. (L. M.) Miracles in the Life, Death, and Resurrection of Christ. I Behold the blind their sight receive; Behold the dead awake and live; The dumb speak wonders, and the lame Leap like the hart and bless his name. II Thus doth th'eternal Spirit own And seal the mission of the Son; The Father vindicates his cause While he hangs bleeding on the cross. III He dies; the heavens in mourning stood; He rises, and appears a God; Behold the Lord ascending high, No more to bleed, no more to die. IV Hence and for ever from my heart I bid my doubts and fears depart, And to those hands my soul resign Which bear credentials so divine. HYMN 138. (L. M.) The Power of the Gospel. I This is the word of truth and love, Sent to the nations from above; Jehovah here resolves to shew What his almighty grace can do. II This remedy did wisdom find To heal diseases of the mind; This sovereign balm, whose virtues can Restore the ruin'd creature, man. III The gospel bids the dead revive, Sinners obey the voice, and live; Dry bones are rais'd and cloth'd afresh, And hearts of stone are turn'd to flesh. IV Where Satan reign'd in shades of night The gospel strikes a heavenly light; Our lusts its wondrous power controls, And calms the rage of angry souls. V Lions and beasts of savage name Put on the nature of the lamb; Whilst the wild world esteems it strange, Gaze, and admire, and hate the change. VI May but this grace my soul renew, Let sinners gaze, and hate me too; The word that saves me does engage A sure defence from all their rage. HYMN 139. (L. M.) The Example of Christ. I My dear Redeemer and my Lord, I read my duty in thy word, But in thy life the law appears Drawn out in living characters. II Such was thy truth, and such thy zeal, Such deference to thy Father's will, Such love, and meekness so divine, I would transcribe and make them mine. III Cold mountains and the midnight air Witness the fervor of thy prayer: The desert thy temptations knew, Thy conflict and thy victory too. IV Be thou my pattern; make me bear More of thy gracious image here; Then God the Judge shall own my name, Amongst the followers of the Lamb. HYMN 140. (C. M.) The Examples of Christ and the Saints. I Give me the wings of faith to rise Within the vail, and see The saints above, how great their joys, How bright their glories be. II Once they were mourning here below, And wet their couch with tears; They wrestled hard, as we do now, With sins, and doubts, and fears. III I ask them whence their victory came, They, with united breath, Ascribe their conquest to the Lamb, Their triumph to his death. IV They mark'd the footsteps that he trod, (His zeal inspir'd their breast;) And following their incarnate God Possess the promis'd rest. V Our glorious leader claims our praise For his own pattern given, While the long cloud of witnesses Shew the same path to heaven. HYMN 141. (C. M.) Faith assisted by Sense; or, Preaching, Baptism, and the Lord's Supper. I My Saviour-God, my Sovereign-Prince Reigns far above the skies; But brings his graces down to sense, And helps my faith to rise. II My eyes and ears shall bless his name, They read and hear his word; My touch and taste shall do the same When they receive the Lord. III Baptismal water is design'd To seal his cleansing grace, While at his feast of bread and wine He gives his saints a place. IV But not the waters of a flood Can make my flesh so clean, As by his Spirit and his blood He'll wash my soul from sin. V Not choicest meats, or noblest wines So much my heart refresh, As when my faith goes thro' the signs And feeds upon his flesh. VI I love the Lord that stoops so low To give his word a seal; But the rich grace his hands bestow Exceeds the figures still. HYMN 142. (S. M.) Faith in Christ our Sacrifice. I Not all the blood of beasts On jewish altars slain Could give the guilty conscience peace, Or wash away the stain. II But Christ the heavenly Lamb Takes all our sins away; A sacrifice of nobler name And richer blood than they. III My faith would lay her hand On that dear head of thine, While like a penitent I stand And there confess my sin. IV My soul looks back to see The burdens thou didst bear When hanging on the cursed tree, And hopes her guilt was there. V Believing we rejoice To see the curse remove; We bless the Lamb with cheerful voice, And sing his bleeding love. HYMN 143. (C. M.) Flesh and Spirit. I What different powers of grace and sin Attend our mortal state! I hate the thoughts that work within, And do the works I hate. II Now I complain, and groan, and die, While sin and Satan reign: Now raise my songs of triumph high, For grace prevails again. III So darkness struggles with the light Till perfect day arise Water and fire maintain the fight Until the weaker dies. IV Thus will the flesh and spirit strive, And vex and break my peace; But I shall quit this mortal life, And sin for ever cease. HYMN 144. (L. M.) The Effusion of the Spirit; or, the Success of the Gospel. I Great was the day, the joy was great, When the divine disciples met; Whilst on their heads the Spirit came, And sat like tongues of cloven flame. II What gifts, what miracles he gave! And power to kill, and power to save! Furnish'd their tongues with wondrous words Instead of shields, and spears, and swords. III Thus arm'd, he sent the champions forth From east to west, from south to north; ‘Go, and assert your Saviour's cause, ‘Go, spread the mystery of his cross.’ IV These weapons of the holy war, Of what almighty force they are To make our stubborn passions bow, And lay the proudest rebel low! V Nations, the learned and the rude, Are by these heavenly arms subdu'd; While Satan rages at his loss, And hates the doctrine of the cross. VI Great King of grace, my heart subdue, I would be led in triumph too, A willing captive to my Lord, And sing the victories of his word. HYMN 145. (C. M.) Sight through a Glass, and Face to Face. I I love the windows of thy grace Through which my Lord is seen, And long to meet my Saviour's face Without a glass between. II O that the happy hour were come To change my faith to sight! I shall behold my Lord at home In a diviner light. III Haste, my beloved, and remove These interposing days; Then shall my passions all be love, And all my powers be praise. HYMN 146. (L. M.) The Vanity of Creatures; or, no Rest on Earth. I Man has a soul of vast desires, He burns within with restless fires, Tost to and fro, his passions fly From vanity to vanity. II In vain on earth we hope to find Some solid good to fill the mind, We try new pleasures, but we feel The inward thirst and torment still. III So when a raging fever burns, We shift from side to side by turns, And 'tis a poor relief we gain To change the place but keep the pain. IV Great God, subdue this vicious thirst, This love to vanity and dust; Cure the vile fever of the mind, And feed our souls with joys refin'd. HYMN 147. (C. M.) The Creation of the World, Gen. i. I ‘Now let a spacious world arise,’ Said the Creator-Lord: At once the obedient earth and skies Rose at his sovereign word. II Dark was the deep; the waters lay Confus'd and drown'd the land: He call'd the light; the new-born day Attends on his command. III He bids the clouds ascend on high; The clouds ascend and bear A watery treasure to the sky, And float on softer air. IV The liquid element below Was gather'd by his hand; The rolling seas together flow, And leave the solid land. V With herbs and plants, a flowery birth, The naked globe he crown'd, Ere there was rain to bless the earth, Or sun to warm the ground. VI Then he adorn'd the upper skies; Behold the sun appears, The moon and stars in order rise To make our months and years. VII Out of the deep th'almighty King Did vital beings frame, The painted fowls of every wing, And fish of every name. VIII He gave the lion and the worm At once their wondrous birth, And grazing beasts of various form Rose from the teeming earth. IX Adam was fram'd of equal clay, Though sovereign of the rest, Design'd for nobler ends than they, With God's own image bless'd. X Thus glorious in the Maker's eye The young creation stood; He saw the building from on high, His word pronounc'd it good. XI Lord, while the frame of nature stands, Thy praise shall fill my tongue; But the new world of grace demands A more exalted song. HYMN 148. (C. M.) God reconciled in Christ. I Dearest of all the names above, My Jesus, and my God, Who can resist thy heavenly love, Or trifle with thy blood? II 'Tis by the merits of thy death The Father smiles again; 'Tis by thine interceding breath The Spirit dwells with men. III Till God in human flesh I see, My thoughts no comfort find; The holy, just, and sacred Three Are terrors to my mind. IV But if Immanuel's face appear, My hope, my joy begins; His name forbids my slavish fear, His grace removes my sins. V While Jews on their own law rely, And Greeks of wisdom boast, I love th'incarnate mystery, And there I fix my trust. HYMN 149. (C. M.) Honour to Magistrates; or, Government from God. I Eternal Sovereign of the sky, And Lord of all below, We mortals to thy majesty Our first obedience owe. II Our souls adore thy throne supreme, And bless thy providence For magistrates of meaner name, Our glory and defence. III The crowns of British princes shine With rays above the rest, Where laws and liberties combine To make the nation bless'd. IV Kingdoms on firm foundations stand, While virtue finds reward; And sinners perish from the land By justice and the sword. V Let Cæsar's due be ever paid To Cæsar and his throne, But consciences and souls were made To be the Lord's alone. HYMN 150. (C. M.) The Deceitfulness of Sin. I Sin has a thousand treacherous arts To practise on the mind; With flattering looks she tempts our hearts, But leaves a sting behind. II With names of virtue she deceives The aged and the young; And while the heedless wretch believes, She makes his fetters strong. III She pleads for all the joys she brings, And gives a fair pretence; But cheats the soul of heavenly things, And chains it down to sense. IV So on a tree divinely fair Grew the forbidden food; Our mother took the poison there, And tainted all her blood. HYMN 151. (L. M.) Prophecy and Inspiration. I 'Twas by an order from the Lord The ancient prophets spoke his word; His spirit did their tongues inspire, And warm'd their hearts with heavenly fire. II The works and wonders which they wrought Confirm'd the messages they brought; The prophet's pen succeeds his breath To save the holy words from death. III Great God, mine eyes with pleasure look On the dear volume of thy book; There my Redeemer's face I see, And read his name who dy'd for me. IV Let the false raptures of the mind Be lost and vanish in the wind; Here I can fix my hope secure, This is thy word and must endure. HYMN 152. (C. M.) Sinai and Sion, Heb. xii. 18, &amp;c. I Not to the terrors of the Lord, The tempest, fire, and smoke, Not to the thunder of that word Which God on Sinai spoke; II But we are come to Sion's hill, The city of our God, Where milder words declare his will, And spread his love abroad. III Behold th'innumerable host Of angels cloth'd in light! Behold the spirits of the just, Whose faith is turn'd to sight! IV Behold the bless'd assembly there, Whose names are writ in heaven; And God the judge of all declares Their vilest sins forgiv'n. V The saints on earth and all the dead But one communion make; All join in Christ their living head, And of his grace partake. VI In such society as this My weary soul would rest; The man that dwells where Jesus is, Must be for ever blest. HYMN 153. (C. M.) The Distemper, Folly, and Madness of Sin. I Sin like a venomous disease Infects our vital blood; The only balm is sovereign grace, And the physician, God. II Our beauty and our strength are fled, And we draw near to death; But Christ the Lord recals the dead With his almighty breath. III Madness by nature reigns within, The passions burn and rage; Till God's own Son with skill divine The inward fire assuage. IV We lick the dust, we grasp the wind, And solid good despise; Such is the folly of the mind Till Jesus makes us wise. V We give our souls the wounds they feel, We drink the poisonous gall, And rush with fury down to hell; But heaven prevents the fall. VI The man possess'd amongst the tombs Cuts his own flesh, and cries; He foams, and raves, till Jesus comes, And the foul spirit flies. HYMN 154. (L. M.) Self-righteousness insufficient. I ‘Where are the mourners,’ Isaiah l. 10. 11. saith the Lord ‘That wait and tremble at thy word? ‘That walk in darkness all the day? ‘Come, make my name your trust and stay. II ‘No works nor duties of your own ‘Can for the smallest sin atone; ‘ Isaiah xxviii. 20.The robes that nature may provide ‘Will not your least pollutions hide. III ‘The softest couch that nature knows ‘Can give the conscience no repose: ‘Look to my righteousness, and live; ‘Comfort and peace are mine to give. IV ‘Ye sons of pride, that kindle coals ‘With your own hands to warm your souls, ‘Walk in the light of your own fire, ‘Enjoy the sparks that ye desire. V ‘This is your portion at my hands; ‘Hell waits you with her iron bands, ‘Ye shall lie down in sorrow there, ‘In death, in darkness and despair.’ HYMN 155. (C. M.) Christ our Passover. I Lo the destroying angel flies To Pharaoh's stubborn land; The pride and flower of Egypt dies By his vindictive hand. II He pass'd the tents of Jacob o'er, Nor pour'd the wrath divine; He saw the blood on every door, And bless'd the peaceful sign. III Thus th'appointed Lamb must bleed To break th'Egyptian yoke; Thus Israel is from bondage freed, And 'scapes the angels stroke. IV Lord, if my heart were sprinkled too, With blood so rich as thine, Justice no longer would pursue This guilty soul of mine. V Jesus our passover was slain, And has at once procur'd Freedom from Satan's heavy chain, And God's avenging sword. HYMN 156. (C. M.) Presumption and Despair; or, Satan's various Temptations. I I hate the tempter and his charms, I hate his flattering breath; The serpent takes a thousand forms To cheat our souls to death. II He feeds our hopes with airy dreams, Or kills with slavish fear; And holds us still in wide extremes, Presumption, or despair. III Now he persuades, ‘How easy 'tis ‘To walk the road to heaven;’ Anon he swells our sins, and cries, ‘They cannot be forgiven.’ IV He bids young sinners, ‘Yet forbear ‘To think of God or death; ‘For prayer and devotion are ‘But melancholy breath.’ V He tells the aged, ‘They must die, ‘And 'tis too late to pray; ‘In vain for mercy now they cry, ‘For they have lost their day.’ VI Thus he supports his cruel throne By mischief and deceit; And drags the sons of Adam down To darkness and the pit. VII Almighty God, cut short his power, Let him in darkness dwell; And, that he vex the earth no more, Confine him down to hell. HYMN 157. (C. M.) The same. [Now Satan comes with dreadful roar] I Now Satan comes with dreadful roar, And threatens to destroy; He worries whom he can't devour With a malicious joy. II Ye sons of God, oppose his rage, Resist, and he'll begone; Thus did our dearest Lord engage And vanquish him alone. III Now he appears almost divine Like innocence and love, But the old serpent lurks within When he assumes the dove. IV Fly from the false deceiver's tongue Ye sons of Adam, fly; Our parents found the snare too strong, Nor should the children try. HYMN 158. (L. M.) Few saved; or, the almost Christian, the Hypocrite and Apostate. I Broad is the road that leads to death, And thousands walk together there; But wisdom shows a narrower path With here and there a traveller. II ‘Deny thyself and take thy cross,’ Is the Redeemer's great command; Nature must count her gold but dross If she would gain this heavenly land. III The fearful soul that tires and faints, And walks the ways of God no more Is but esteem'd almost a saint, And makes his own destruction sure. IV Lord, let not all my hopes be vain Create my heart entirely new, Which hypocrites could ne'er attain, Which false apostates never knew. HYMN 159. (C. M.) An unconverted State; or, converting Grace. I Great King of glory and of grace, We own, with humble shame, How vile is our degenerate race, And our first father's name. II From Adam flows our tainted blood The poison reigns within, Makes us averse to all that's good, And willing slaves to sin. III Daily we break thy holy laws, And then reject thy grace; Engag'd in the old serpent's cause Against our Maker's face. IV We live estrang'd afar from God, And love the distance well; With haste we run the dangerous road That leads to death and hell. V And can such rebels be restor'd! Such natures made divine! Let sinners see thy glory, Lord, And feel this power of thine. VI We raise our Father's name on high, Who his own Spirit sends To bring rebellious strangers nigh, And turn his foes to friends. HYMN 160. (L. M.) Custom in Sin. I Let the wild leopards of the wood Put off the spots that nature gives, Then may the wicked turn to God, And change their tempers and their lives. II As well might Ethiopian slaves Wash out the darkness of their skin; The dead as well might leave their graves As old transgressors cease to sin. III Where vice has held its empire long 'Twill not endure the least control; None but a power divinely strong Can turn the current of the soul. IV Great God, I own thy power divine, That works to change this heart of mine; I would be form'd anew, and bless The wonders of creating grace. HYMN 161. (C. M.) Christian Virtues; or, the Difficulty of Conversion. I Strait is the way, the door is strait That leads to joys on high; 'Tis but a few that find the gate, While crowds mistake, and die. II Beloved self must be deny'd, The mind and will renew'd, Passion suppress'd, and patience try'd, And vain desires subdu'd. III Flesh is a dangerous foe to grace, Where it prevails and rules; Flesh must be humbled, pride abas'd, Lest they destroy our souls. IV The love of gold be banished hence, (That vile idolatry) And every member, every sense In sweet subjection lie. V The tongue, that most unruly power, Requires a strong restraint; We must be watchful every hour, And pray, but never faint. VI Lord, can a feeble helpless worm Fulfil a task so hard? Thy grace must all my work perform, And give the free reward. HYMN 162. (C. M.) Meditation of Heaven; or, the Joy of Faith. I My thoughts surmount these lower skies And look within the veil; There springs of endless pleasure rise, The waters never fail. II There I behold with sweet delight The blessed Three in One; And strong affections fix my sight On God's incarnate Son. III His promise stands for ever firm, His grace shall ne'er depart; He binds my name upon his arm, And seals it on his heart. IV Light are the pains that nature brings, How short our sorrows are When with eternal future things The present we compare! V I would not be a stranger still To that celestial place, Where I for ever hope to dwell Near my Redeemer's face. HYMN 163. (C. M.) Complaint of Desertion and Temptations. I Dear Lord, behold our sore distress; Our sins attempt to reign; Stretch out thine arm of conquering grace And let thy foes be slain. II The lion with his dreadful roar Affrights thy feeble sheep: Reveal the glory of thy power, And chain him to the deep. III Must we indulge a long despair? Shall our petitions die; Our mournings never reach thine ear, Nor tears affect thine eye? IV If thou despise a mortal groan Yet hear a Saviour's blood; An advocate so near the throne Pleads and prevails with God. V He brought the Spirit's powerful sword To slay our deadly foes: Our sins shall die beneath thy word, And hell in vain oppose. VI How boundless is our Father's grace, In height, and depth, and length! He makes his Son our righteousness, His Spirit is our strength. HYMN 164. (C. M.) The End of the World. I Why should this earth delight us so? Why should we fix our eyes On these low grounds where sorrows grow, And every pleasure dies? II While time his sharpest teeth prepares Our comforts to devour, There is a land above the stars, And joys above his power. III Nature shall be dissolv'd and die, The sun must end his race, The earth and sea for ever fly Before my Saviour's face. IV When will that glorious morning rise! When the last trumpet sound, And call the nations to the skies, From underneath the ground? HYMN 165. (C. M.) Unfruitfulness, Ignorance, and unsanctified Affections. I Long have I sat beneath the sound Of thy salvation, Lord, But still how weak my faith is found, And knowledge of thy word! II Oft I frequent thy holy place And hear almost in vain; How small a portion of thy grace My memory can retain! III My dear Almighty, and my God, How little art thou known By all the judgments of thy rod, And blessings of thy throne! IV How cold and feeble is my love! How negligent my fear! How low my hope of joys above! How few affections there! V Great God, thy sovereign power impart To give thy word success: Write the salvation in my heart, And make me learn thy grace. VI Shew my forgetful feet the way That leads to joys on high; There knowledge grows without decay, And love shall never die. HYMN 166. (C. M.) The Divine Perfections. I How shall I praise th'eternal God, That infinite Unknown? Who can ascend his high abode, Or venture near his throne? II The great invisible! He dwells Conceal'd in dazzling light; But his all-searching eye reveals The secrets of the night. III Those watchful eyes that never sleep Survey the world around; His wisdom is a boundless deep Where all our thoughts are drown'd. IV Speak we of strength? His arm is strong To save or to destroy: Infinite years his life prolong, And endless is his joy. V He knows no shadow of a change, Nor alters his decrees; Firm as a rock his truth remains To guard his promises. VI Sinners before his presence die; How holy is his name! His anger and his jealousy Burn like devouring flame. VII Justice upon a dreadful throne Maintains the rights of God; While mercy sends her pardons down Bought with a Saviour's blood. VIII Now to my soul, immortal King, Speak some forgiving word; Then 'twill be double joy to sing The glories of my Lord. HYMN 167. (L. M.) The Divine Perfections. I Great God, thy glories shall employ My holy fear, my humble joy; My lips in songs of honour bring Their tribute to th'eternal King. II Earth and the stars and worlds unknown Depend precarious on his throne; All nature hangs upon his word, And grace and glory own their Lord. III His sovereign power what mortal knows? If he command who dares oppose? With strength he girds himself around, And treads the rebels to the ground. IV Who shall pretend to teach him skill? Or guide the counsels of his will? His wisdom like a sea divine Flows deep and high beyond our line. V His name is holy, and his eye Burns with immortal jealousy; He hates the sons of pride, and sheds His fiery vengeance on their heads. VI The beamings of his piercing sight Bring dark hypocrisy to light; Death and destruction naked lie, And hell uncover'd to his eye. VII Th'eternal law before him stands; His justice with impartial hands Divides to all their due reward, Or by the sceptre or the sword. VIII His mercy like a boundless sea Washes our loads of guilt away, While his own Son came down and dy'd T'engage his justice on our side. IX Each of his words demands my faith, My soul can rest on all he saith; His truth inviolably keeps The largest promise of his lips. X O tell me with a gentle voice ‘Thou art my God,’ and I'll rejoice! Fill'd with thy love, I dare proclaim The brightest honours of thy name. HYMN 168. (L. M.) The same. [Jehovah reigns, his throne is high] I Jehovah reigns, his throne is high, His robes are light and majesty; His glory shines with beams so bright No mortal can sustain the sight. II His terrors keep the world in awe, His justice guards his holy law, His love reveals a smiling face, His truth and promise seal the grace. III Through all his works his wisdom shines, And baffles Satan's deep designs; His power is sovereign to fulfil The noblest counsels of his will. IV And will this glorious Lord descend To be my father and my friend! Then let my songs with angels join; Heaven is secure if God be mine. HYMN 169. As the 148th Psalm. The same. [The Lord Jehovah reigns] I The Lord Jehovah reigns, His throne is built on high; The garments he assumes Are light and majesty; His glories shine With beams so bright No mortal eye Can bear the sight. II The thunders of his hand Keep the wide world in awe; His wrath and justice stand To guard his holy law; And where his love Resolves to bless, His truth confirms And seals the grace. III Thro' all his ancient works Surprising wisdom shines, Confounds the powers of hell, And breaks their curs'd designs: Strong is his arm, And shall fulfil His great decrees, His sovereign will. IV And can this mighty King Of glory condescend? And will he write his name, ‘My Father and my Friend?’ I love his name, I love his word; Join all my powers, And praise the Lord. HYMN 170. (L. M.) God Incomprehensible and Sovereign. I Can creatures to perfection find Job xi. 7. Th'eternal uncreated mind? Or can the largest stretch of thought Measure and search his nature out? II 'Tis high as heaven, 'tis deep as hell, And what can mortals know or tell? His glory spreads beyond the sky, And all the shining worlds on high. III But man, vain man, would fain be wise, Born like a wild young colt he flies Thro' all the follies of his mind, And swells, and snuffs the empty wind. IV God is a king of power unknown, Firm are the orders of his throne; If he resolve, who dares oppose, Or ask him why, or what he does? V He wounds the heart, and he makes whole; He calms the tempest of the soul; When he shuts up in long despair Who can remove the heavy bar? VI Job xxv. 5.He frowns, and darkness veils the moon, The fainting sun grows dim at noon; Job xxvi. 11, &amp;c.The pillars of heaven's starry roof Tremble and start at his reproof. VII He gave the vaulted heaven its form, The crooked serpent, and the worm; He breaks the billows with his breath, And smites the sons of pride to death. VIII These are a portion of his ways, But who shall dare describe his face? Who can endure his light? or stand To hear the thunders of his hand? END OF THE SECOND BOOK. BOOK III. PREPARED FOR THE LORD'S SUPPER. HYMN 1 (L. M.) The Lord's Supper instituted, 1 Cor. xi. 23, &amp;c. I 'Twas on that dark, that doleful night When powers of earth and hell arose Against the Son of God's delight, And friends betray'd him to his foes: II Before the mournful scene began He took the bread, and blest, and brake: What love thro' all his actions ran! What wondrous words of grace he spake! III ‘This is my body broke for sin, ‘Receive and eat the living food:’ Then took the cup, and blest the wine; ‘'Tis the new cov'nant in my blood.’ IV For us his flesh with nails was torn, He bore the scourge, he felt the thorn; And justice pour'd upon his head Its heavy vengeance in our stead. V For us his vital blood was spilt, To buy the pardon of our guilt, When for black crimes of biggest size He gave his soul a sacrifice. VI ‘Do this’ (he cry'd) ‘till time shall end, ‘In memory of your dying friend; ‘Meet at my table, and record ‘The love of your departed Lord.’ VII Jesus, thy feast we celebrate, We show thy death, we sing thy name, Till thou return, and we shall eat The marriage supper of the Lamb. HYMN 2. (S. M.) Communion with Christ, and with Saints, 1 Cor. x. 16, 17. I Jesus invites his saints To meet around his board; Here pardon'd rebels sit, and hold Communion with their Lord. II For food he gives his flesh, He bids us drink his blood; Amazing favour! matchless grace Of our descending God! III This holy bread and wine Maintains our fainting breath, By union with our living Lord, And interest in his death. IV Our heavenly Father calls Christ and his members one; We the young children of his love, And he the first-born Son. V We are but several parts Of the same broken bread; One body hath its several limbs, But Jesus is the head. VI Let all our powers be join'd His glorious name to raise; Pleasure and love fill every mind, And every voice be praise. HYMN 3. (C. M.) The New Testament in the Blood of Christ; or, the New Covenant sealed. I ‘The promise of my Father's love ‘Shall stand for ever good;’ He said; and gave his soul to death, And seal'd the grace with blood. II To this dear covenant of thy word I set my worthless name; I seal th'engagement to my Lord, And make my humble claim. III Thy light, and strength, and pardoning grace, And glory shall be mine; My life and soul, my heart and flesh, And all my powers are thine. IV I call that legacy my own Which Jesus did bequeath; 'Twas purchas'd with a dying groan, And ratify'd in death. V Sweet is the memory of his name, Who bless'd us in his will, And to his testament of love Made his own life the seal. HYMN 4. (C. M.) Christ's dying Love; or, our Pardon bought at a dear Price. I How condescending and how kind Was God's eternal Son! Our misery reach'd his heavenly mind, And pity brought him down. II When justice by our sins provok'd Drew forth its dreadful sword, He gave his soul up to the stroke Without a murmuring word. III He sunk beneath our heavy woes To raise us to his throne; There's ne'er a gift his hand bestows But cost his heart a groan. IV This was compassion like a God, That when the Saviour knew The price of pardon was his blood, His pity ne'er withdrew. V Now, tho' he reigns exalted high, His love is still as great: Well he remembers Calvary, Nor lets his saints forget. VI Here we behold his bowels roll As kind as when he dy'd; And see the sorrows of his soul Bleed thro' his wounded side. VII Here we receive repeated seals Of Jesus' dying love: Hard is the wretch that never feels One soft affection move. VIII Here let our hearts begin to melt, While we his death record, And with our joy for pardon'd guilt Mourn that we pierc'd the Lord. HYMN 5. (C. M.) Christ the Bread of Life, John vi. 31, 35, 39. I Let us adore th'eternal word, 'Tis he our souls hath fed; Thou art our living stream, O Lord, And thou th'immortal bread. II The manna came from lower skies, But Jesus from above, Where the fresh springs of pleasure rise And rivers flow with love. III The Jews the fathers dy'd at last Who eat that heavenly bread; But these provisions which we taste Can raise us from the dead. IV Blest be the Lord that gives his flesh To nourish dying men; And often spreads his table fresh Lest we should faint again. V Our souls shall draw their heavenly breath While Jesus finds supplies; Nor shall our graces sink to death, For Jesus never dies. VI Daily our mortal flesh decays, But Christ our life shall come; His unresisted power shall raise Our bodies from the tomb. HYMN 6. (L. M.) The Memorial of our absent Lord, John xvi. 16. Luke xxii. 19. John xiv. 3. I Jesus is gone above the skies, Where our weak senses reach him not; And carnal objects court our eyes To thrust our Saviour from our thought. II He knows what wandering hearts we have Apt to forget his lovely face; And to refresh our minds he gave These kind memorials of his grace. III The Lord of life this table spread With his own flesh and dying blood; We on the rich provision feed, And taste the wine, and bless the God. IV Let sinful sweets be all forgot, And earth grow less in our esteem; Christ and his love fill every thought, And faith and hope be fix'd on him. V While he is absent from our sight 'Tis to prepare our souls a place, That we may dwell in heavenly light, And live for ever near his face. VI Our eyes look upwards to the hills Whence our returning Lord shall come; We wait thy chariot's awful wheels To fetch our longing spirits home. HYMN 7. (L. M.) Crucifixion to the World by the Cross of Christ, Gal. vi. 14. I When I survey the wondrous cross On which the prince of glory dy'd, My richest gain I count but loss, And pour contempt on all my pride. II Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast, Save in the death of Christ my God; All the vain things that charm me most, I sacrifice them to his blood. III See from his head, his hands, his feet, Sorrow and love flow mingled down; Did e'er such love and sorrow meet? Or thorns compose so rich a crown? IV His dying crimson like a robe Spreads o'er his body on the tree, Then am I dead to all the globe, And all the globe is dead to me. V Were the whole realm of nature mine That were a present far too small; Love so amazing, so divine Demands my soul, my life, my all. HYMN 8. (C. M.) The Tree of Life. I Come let us join a joyful tune To our exalted Lord, Ye saints on high around his throne, And we around his board. II While once upon this lower ground Weary and faint ye stood, What dear refreshments here ye found From this immortal food! III The tree of life that near the throne In heaven's high garden grows, Laden with grace bends gently down Its ever-smiling boughs. IV Hov'ring amongst the leaves there stands The sweet celestial dove; And Jesus on the branches hangs The banner of his love. V 'Tis a young heaven of strange delight While in his shade we sit; His fruit is pleasing to the sight, And to the taste as sweet. VI New life it spreads thro' dying hearts, And cheers the drooping mind; Vigour and joy the juice imparts Without a sting behind. VII Now let the flaming weapon stand, And guard all Eden's trees; There's ne'er a plant in all that land That bears such fruits as these. VIII Infinite grace our souls adore, Whose wondrous hand has made This living branch of sovereign power To raise and heal the dead. HYMN 9. (S. M.) The Spirit, the Water, and the Blood, 1 John v. 6. I Let all our tongues be one To praise our God on high, Who from his bosom sent his Son To fetch us strangers nigh. II Nor let our voices cease To sing the Saviour's name; Jesus th'ambassador of peace How cheerfully he came! III It cost him cries and tears To bring us near to God; Great was our debt, and he appears To make the payment good. IV My Saviour's pierced side, Pour'd out a double flood; By water we are purify'd, And pardon'd by the blood. V Infinite was our guilt, But he our priest atones; On the cold ground his life was spilt, And offer'd with his groans. VI Look up my soul to him Whose death was thy desert, And humbly view the living stream Flow from his breaking heart. VII There on the cursed tree In dying pangs he lies, Fulfils his Father's great decree, And all our wants supplies. VIII Thus the Redeemer came By water and by blood; And when the Spirit speaks the same, We feel his witness good. IX While the Eternal Three Bear their record above, Here I believe he dy'd for me, And seal my Saviour's love. X Lord, cleanse my soul from sin, Nor let thy grace depart; Great Comforter, abide within, And witness to my heart. HYMN 10. (L. M.) Christ crucified; the Wisdom and Power of God. I Nature with open volume stands To spread her Maker's praise abroad; And every labour of his hands Shews something worthy of a God. II But in the grace that rescu'd man His brightest form of glory shines; Here on the cross 'tis fairest drawn In precious blood and crimson lines. III Here his whole name appears complete; Nor wit can guess, nor reason prove Which of the letters best is writ, The power, the wisdom, or the love. IV Here I behold his inmost heart Where grace and vengeance strangely join Piercing his Son with sharpest smart To make the purchas'd pleasure mine. V O the sweet wonders of that cross Where God the Saviour lov'd and dy'd! Her noblest life my spirit draws From his dear wounds and bleeding side. VI I would for ever speak his name In sounds to mortal ears unknown, With angels join to praise the Lamb, And worship at his Father's throne. HYMN 11. (C. M.) Pardon brought to our Senses. I Lord, how divine thy comforts are! How heavenly is the place Where Jesus spreads the sacred feast Of his redeeming grace! II There the rich bounties of our God And sweetest glories shine, There Jesus says, that ‘I am his, ‘And my beloved's mine.’ III ‘Here,’ (says the kind redeeming Lord, And shews his wounded side) ‘See here the spring of all your joys, ‘That open'd when I died.’ IV He smiles and cheers my mournful heart And tells of all his pain, ‘All this,’ says he, ‘I bore for thee,’ And then he smiles again. V What shall we pay our heavenly King For grace so vast as this? He brings our pardon to our eyes, And seals it with a kiss. VI Let such amazing loves as these Be sounded all abroad, Such favours are beyond degrees, And worthy of a God. VII To him that wash'd us in his blood Be everlasting praise, Salvation, honour, glory, power, Eternal as his days. HYMN 12. (L. M.) The Gospel Feast, Luke xiv. 16, &amp;c. I How rich are thy provisions, Lord! Thy table furnish'd from above, The fruits of life o'erspread the board, The cup o'erflows with heavenly love. II Thine ancient family the Jews Were first invited to the feast, We humbly take what they refuse, And gentiles thy salvation taste. III We are the poor, the blind, the lame, And help was far, and death was nigh, But at the gospel call we came, And every want receiv'd supply. IV From the high-way that leads to hell, From paths of darkness and despair, Lord, we are come with thee to dwell, Glad to enjoy thy presence here. V What shall we pay th'eternal Son That left the heaven of his abode, And to this wretched earth came down To bring us wanderers back to God. VI It cost him death to save our lives, To buy our souls it cost his own; And all the unknown joys he gives Were bought with agonies unknown. VII Our everlasting love is due To him that ransom'd sinners lost; And pity'd rebels when he knew The vast expense his love would cost. HYMN 13. (C. M.) Divine Love making a Feast, and calling in the Guests, Luke xiv. 17, 22, 23. I How sweet and awful is the place With Christ within the doors, While everlasting love displays The choicest of her stores! II Here every bowel of our God With soft compassion rolls, Here peace and pardon bought with blood Is food for dying souls. III While all our hearts and all our songs Join to admire the feast, Each of us cry with thankful tongues ‘Lord, why was I a guest? IV ‘Why was I made to hear thy voice, ‘And enter while there's room? ‘When thousands make a wretched choice ‘And rather starve than come.’ V 'Twas the same love that spread the feast, That sweetly forc'd us in, Else we had still refus'd to taste, And perish'd in our sin. VI Pity the nations, O our God, Constrain the earth to come; Send thy victorious word abroad, And bring the strangers home. VII We long to see thy churches full, That all the chosen race May with one voice and heart and soul Sing thy redeeming grace. HYMN 14. (L. M.) The Song of Simeon, Luke ii. 28; or, a Sight of Christ makes Death easy. I Now have our hearts embrac'd our God, We would forget all earthly charms, And wish to die as Simeon would, With his young Saviour in his arms. II Our lips should learn that joyful song, Were but our hearts prepar'd like his, Our souls still willing to be gone, And at thy word depart in peace. III Here we have seen thy face, O Lord, And view'd salvation with our eyes, Tasted and felt the living word, The bread descending from the skies. IV Thou hast prepar'd this dying Lamb, Hast set his blood before our face, To teach the terrors of thy name, And shew the wonders of thy grace. V He is our light; our morning star Shall shine on nations yet unknown: The glory of thine Israel here, And joy of spirits near the throne. HYMN 15. (C. M.) Our Lord Jesus at his own Table. I The memory of our dying Lord Awakes a thankful tongue: How rich he spread his royal board, And blest the food, and sung. II Happy the men that eat this bread, But double blest was he That gently bow'd his loving head, And lean'd it, Lord, on thee. III By faith the same delights we taste As that great favourite did, And sit and lean on Jesus' breast, And take the heavenly bread. IV Down from the palace of the skies Hither the King descends, ‘Come, my beloved, eat, (he cries) ‘And drink salvation, friends. V ‘My flesh is food and physic too, ‘A balm for all your pains: ‘And the red streams of pardon flow ‘From these my pierced veins.’ VI Hosanna to his bounteous love For such a taste below! And yet he feeds his saints above With nobler blessings too. VII Come the dear day, the glorious hour That brings our souls to rest! Then we shall need these types no more, But dwell at th'heavenly feast. HYMN 16. (C. M.) The Agonies of Christ. I Now let our pains be all forgot, Our hearts no more repine, Our sufferings are not worth a thought, When, Lord, compar'd with thine. II In lively figures here we see The bleeding Prince of love; Each of us hope, he dy'd for me, And then our griefs remove. III Our humble faith here takes her rise While sitting round his board; And back to Calvary she flies To view her groaning Lord. IV His soul what agonies it felt When his own God withdrew! And the large load of all our guilt Lay heavy on him too. V But the divinity within Supported him to bear: Dying he conquer'd hell and sin, And made his triumph there. VI Grace, wisdom, justice join'd and wrought The wonders of that day: No mortal tongue, nor mortal thought Can equal thanks repay. VII Our hymns should sound like those above, Could we our voices raise; Yet, Lord, our hearts shall all be love, And all our lives be praise. HYMN 17. (S. M.) Incomparable Food; or, the Flesh and Blood of Christ. I We sing th'amazing deeds That grace divine performs; Th'eternal God comes down and bleeeds To nourish dying worms. II This soul-reviving wine, Dear Saviour, 'tis thy blood; We thank that sacred flesh of thine For this immortal food. III The banquet that we eat Is made of heavenly things, Earth hath no dainties half so sweet As our Redeemer brings. IV In vain had Adam sought And search'd his garden round, For there was no such blessed fruit In all the happy ground. V Th'angelic host above Can never taste this food, They feast upon their Maker's love, But not a Saviour's blood. VI On us th'Almighty Lord Bestows this matchless grace, And meets us with some cheering word, With pleasure in his face. VII Come, all ye drooping saints, And banquet with the King, This wine will drown your sad complaints, And tune your voice to sing. VIII Salvation to the name Of our adored Christ: Thro' the wide earth his grace proclaim, His glory in the high'st. HYMN 18. (L. M.) The same. [Jesus, we bow before thy feet] I Jesus, we bow before thy feet, Thy table is divinely stor'd: Thy sacred flesh our souls have eat, 'Tis living bread; we thank thee, Lord! II And here we drink our Saviour's blood, We thank thee, Lord, 'tis generous wine; Mingled with love the fountain flow'd From that dear bleeding heart of thine. III On earth is no such sweetness found, For the Lamb's flesh is heavenly food; In vain we search the globe around For bread so fine, or wine so good. IV Carnal provisions can at best But cheer the heart or warm the head, But the rich cordial that we taste Gives life eternal to the dead. V Joy to the master of the feast, His name our souls for ever bless: To God the King and God the Priest A loud Hosanna round the place. HYMN 19. (L. M.) Glory in the Cross; or, not ashamed of Christ crucified. I At thy command, our dearest Lord, Here we attend thy dying feast; Thy blood like wine adorns thy board, And thine own flesh feeds every guest. II Our faith adores thy bleeding love, And trusts for life in one that dy'd; We hope for heavenly crowns above From a Redeemer crucify'd. III Let the vain world pronounce it shame, And fling their scandals on thy cause; We come to boast our Saviour's name, And make our triumphs in his cross. IV With joy we tell the scoffing age He that was dead has left his tomb, He lives above their utmost rage, And we are waiting till he come. HYMN 20. (C. M.) The Provisions for the Table of our Lord; or, the Tree of Life, and River of Love. I Lord, we adore thy bounteous hand, And sing the solemn feast Where sweet celestial dainties stand For every willing guest. II The tree of life adorns the board With rich immortal fruit, And ne'er an angry flaming sword To guard the passage to 't. III The cup stands crown'd with living juice; The fountain flows above, And runs down streaming for our use In rivulets of love. IV The food's prepar'd by heavenly art, The pleasure's well refin'd, They spread new life thro' every heart, And cheer the drooping mind. V Shout and proclaim the Saviour's love, Ye saints that taste his wine, Join with your kindred saints above, In loud hosannas join. VI A thousand glories to the God That gives such joys as this, Hosanna! let it sound abroad, And reach where Jesus is. HYMN 21. (C. M.) The triumphal Feast for Christ's Victory over Sin, and Death, and Hell. I Come let us lift our voices high, High as our joys arise, And join the songs above the sky, Where pleasure never dies. II Jesus, the God that fought and bled, And conquer'd when he fell, That rose, and at his chariot wheels Dragg'd all the powers of hell. III Jesus the God invites us here To this triumphal feast, And brings immortal blessings down For each redeemed guest. IV The Lord! how glorious is his face! How kind his smiles appear! And O what melting words he says To every humble ear! V ‘For you, the children of my love, ‘It was for you I dy'd, ‘Behold my hands, behold my feet, ‘And look into my side. VI ‘These are the wounds for you I bore, ‘The tokens of my pains, ‘When I came down to free your souls ‘From misery and chains. VII ‘Justice unsheathed its fiery sword, ‘And plung'd it in my heart: ‘Infinite pangs for you I bore, ‘And most tormenting smart. VIII ‘When hell and all its spiteful powers ‘Stood dreadful in my way, ‘To rescue those dear lives of yours ‘I gave my own away. IX ‘But while I bled and groan'd and dy'd, ‘I ruin'd Satan's throne, ‘High on my cross I hung, and spy'd ‘The monster tumbling down. X ‘Now you must triumph at my feast, ‘And taste my flesh, my blood; ‘And live eternal ages blest, ‘For 'tis immortal food.’ XI Victorious God! what can we pay For favours so divine? We would devote our hearts away To be for ever thine. XII We give thee, Lord, our highest praise, The tribute of our tongues; But themes so infinite as these Exceed our noblest songs. HYMN 22. (L. M.) The Compassion of a dying Christ. I Our spirits join t'adore the Lamb; O that our feeble lips could move In strains immortal as his name, And melting as his dying love. II Was ever equal pity found? The prince of heaven resigns his breath, And pours his life out on the ground To ransom guilty worms from death. III Rebels, we broke our Maker's law; He from the threatening set us free, Bore the full vengeance on his cross, And nail'd the curses to the tree. IV The law proclaims no terror now, And Sinai's thunder roars no more; From all his wounds new blessings flow, A sea of joy without a shore. V Here we have wash'd our deepest stains, And heal'd our wounds with heavenly blood: Blest fountain! springing from the veins Of Jesus our incarnate God. VI In vain our mortal voices strive To speak compassion so divine; Had we a thousand lives to give, A thousand lives should all be thine. HYMN 23. (C. M.) Grace and Glory by the Death of Christ. I Sitting around our father's board We raise our tuneful breath; Our faith beholds her dying Lord, And dooms our sins to death. II We see the blood of Jesus shed, Whence all our pardons rise; The sinner views the atonement made, And loves the sacrifice. III Thy cruel thorns, thy shameful cross Procure us heavenly crowns; Our highest gain springs from thy loss, Our healing from thy wounds. IV O 'tis impossible that we, Who dwell in feeble clay, Should equal sufferings bear for thee, Or equal thanks repay. HYMN 24. (C. M.) Pardon and Strength from Christ. I Father, we wait to feel thy grace, To see thy glories shine; The Lord will his own table bless, And make the feast divine. II We touch, we taste the heavenly bread, We drink the sacred cup; With outward forms our sense is fed, Our souls rejoice in hope. III We shall appear before the throne Of our forgiving God, Drest in the garments of his Son, And sprinkled with his blood. IV We shall be strong to run the race, And climb the upper sky; Christ will provide our souls with grace, He bought a large supply. V Let us indulge a cheerful frame For joy becomes a feast; We love the memory of his name, More than the wine we taste. HYMN 25. (C. M.) Divine Glories and our Graces. I How are thy glories here display'd, Great God, how bright they shine, While at thy word we break the bread, And pour the flowing wine! II Here thy revenging justice stands And pleads its dreadful cause; Here saving mercy spreads her hands Like Jesus on the cross. III Thy saints attend with every grace On this great sacrifice; And love appears with cheerful face, And faith with fixed eyes. IV Our hope in waiting posture sits, To heaven directs her sight; Here every warmer passion meets, And warmer powers unite. V Zeal and revenge perform their part, And rising sin destroy; Repentance comes with aching heart, Yet not forbids the joy. VI Dear Saviour, change our faith to sight, Let sin for ever die; Then shall our souls be all delight, And every tear be dry. DOXOLOGIES. I CANNOT persuade myself to put a full period to these Divine Hymns, till I have addressed a special song of Glory unto God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Though the Latin name of it, Gloria Patri, be retained in our nation from the Roman Church: and though there be some excesses of superstitious honour paid to the words of it, which may have wrought some unhappy prejudices in weaker Christians, yet I believe it still to be one of the noblest parts of Christian worship. The subject of it is the doctrine of the Trinity, which is that peculiar glory of the Divine Nature, that our Lord Jesus Christ has so clearly revealed unto men, and is so necessary to true Christianity. The action is praise, which is the most complete and exalted part of Heavenly Worship. I have cast the song into a variety of forms, and have fitted it by a plain version or a larger paraphrase, to be sung either alone or at the conclusion of another Hymn. I have added also a few Hosannas, or ascriptions of salvation to Christ, in the same manner, and for the same end. HYMN 26. (1st L. M.) A Song of Praise to the ever-blessed Trinity. God the Father, Son, and Spirit. I Bless'd be the Father and his love, To whose celestial source we owe Rivers of endless joy above, And rills of comfort here below. II Glory to thee, great Son of God, From whose dear wounded body rolls A precious stream of vital blood, Pardon and life for dying souls. III We give the sacred Spirit praise, Who in our hearts of sin and woe Makes living springs of grace arise, And into boundless glory flow. IV Thus God the Father, God the Son, And God the Spirit, we adore, That sea of life and love unknown Without a bottom or a shore. HYMN 27. (1st C. M.) [Glory to God the Father's name] I Glory to God the Father's name, Who, from our sinful race, Chose out his favourites to proclaim The honours of his grace. II Glory to God the Son be paid, Who dwelt in humble clay, And to redeem us from the dead Gave his own life away. III Glory to God the Spirit give, From whose almighty power Our souls their heavenly birth derive, And bless the happy hour. IV Glory to God that reigns above, Th'eternal Three and One, Who by the wonders of his love Has made his nature known. HYMN 28. (1st S. M.) [Let God the Father live] I Let God the Father live For ever on our tongues; Sinners from his first love derive The ground of all their songs. II Ye saints, employ your breath In honour to the Son, Who bought your souls from hell and death By offering up his own. III Give to the Spirit praise Of an immortal strain, Whose light and power and grace conveys Salvation down to men. IV While God the Comforter Reveals our pardon'd sin, O may the blood and water bear The same record within. V To the great One and Three That seal this grace in heaven, The Father, Son, and Spirit, be Eternal glory given. HYMN 29. (2d L. M.) [Glory to God the Trinity] I Glory to God the Trinity, Whose name has mysteries unknown; In essence one, in person three; A social nature, yet alone. II When all our noblest powers are join'd The honours of thy name to raise, Thy glories over-match our mind, And angels faint beneath the praise. HYMN 30. (2d C. M.) [The God of mercy be ador'd] I The God of mercy be ador'd, Who calls our souls from death, Who saves by his redeeming word, And new-creating breath. II To praise the Father and the Son And Spirit all divine, The One in Three, and Three in One, Let saints and angels join. HYMN 31. (2d S. M.) [Let God the Maker's name] I Let God the Maker's name Have honour, love and fear, To God the Saviour pay the same, And God the Comforter. II Father of Lights above Thy mercy we adore, The Son of thy eternal love, And Spirit of thy power. HYMN 32. (3d L. M.) [To God the Father, God the Son] I To God the Father, God the Son, And God the Spirit, Three in One, Be honour, praise, and glory given, By all on earth, and all in heaven. HYMN 33. (L. M.) [All glory to thy wondrous name] Or thus: All glory to thy wondrous name, Father of mercy, God of love, Thus we exalt the Lord, the Lamb, And thus we praise the heavenly Dove. HYMN 34. (3d C. M.) [Now let the Father and the Son] Now let the Father and the Son And Spirit be ador'd, Where there are works to make him known, Or saints to love the Lord. HYMN 35. (C. M.) [Honour to the Almighty Three] Or thus: Honour to the Almighty Three, And everlasting One; All glory to the Father be, The Spirit, and the Son. HYMN 36. (3d S. M.) [Ye angels round the throne] Ye angels round the throne, And saints that dwell below, Worship the Father, love the Son, And bless the Spirit too. HYMN 37. (S. M.) [Give to the Father praise] Or thus: Give to the Father praise, Give glory to the Son, And to the Spirit of his grace Be equal honour done. HYMN 38. (1st as the 148th Psalm.) A Song of Praise to the Blessed Trinity. I I give immortal praise To God the Father's love For all my comforts here, And better hopes above; He sent his own Eternal Son To die for sins That man had done. II To God the Son belongs Immortal glory too, Who bought us with his blood From everlasting woe: And now he lives, And now he reigns, And see the fruit Of all his pains. III To God the Spirit's name Immortal worship give, Whose new-creating power Makes the dead sinner live: His work completes The great design, And fills the soul With joy divine. IV Almighty God, to Thee Be endless honours done, The undivided Three, And the Mysterious One: Where reason fails With all her powers, Their faith prevails, And love adores. HYMN 39. (2d as the 148th Psalm.) [To Him that chose us first] I To Him that chose us first Before the world began, To Him that bore the curse To save rebellious man, To Him that form'd Our hearts anew, Is endless praise And glory due. II The Father's love shall run Thro' our immortal songs, We bring to God the Son Hosannas on our tongues: Our lips address The Spirit's name With equal praise, And zeal the same. III Let every saint above, And angel round the throne, For ever bless and love The sacred Three in One: Thus heaven shall raise His honours high When earth and time Grow old and die. HYMN 40. (3d as the 148th Psalm.) [To God the Father's throne] To God the Father's throne Perpetual honours raise; Glory to God the Son, To God the Spirit praise: And while our lips Their tribute bring, Our faith adores The name we sing. HYMN 41. (As the 148th Psalm.) [To our eternal God] Or thus: To our eternal God, The Father and the Son, And Spirit all divine, Three mysteries in One, Salvation, power, And praise be given, By all on earth And all in heaven. HYMN 42. (L. M.) The HOSANNA; or, Salvation ascribed to Christ. I Hosanna to king David's Son Who reigns on a superior throne; We bless the prince of heavenly birth Who brings salvation down to earth. II Let every nation, every age, In this delightful work engage; Old men and babes in Sion sing The growing glories of her King. HYMN 43. (C. M.) [Hosanna to the Prince of grace] I Hosanna to the Prince of grace, Sion, behold thy King; Proclaim the Son of David's race, And teach the babes to sing. II Hosanna to th'Incarnate Word, Who from the Father came; Ascribe salvation to the Lord, With blessings on his name. HYMN 44. (S. M.) [Hosanna to the Son] I Hosanna to the Son Of David and of God, Who brought the news of pardon down, And bought it with his blood. II To Christ the anointed King Be endless blessings given, Let the whole earth his glory sing Who made our peace with heaven. HYMN 45. (As the 148th Psalm.) [Hosanna to the King] I Hosanna to the King Of David's ancient blood; Behold he comes to bring Forgiving grace from God: Let old and young Attend his way, And at his feet Their honours lay. II Glory to God on high, Salvation to the Lamb; Let earth, and sea, and sky His wondrous love proclaim: Upon his head Shall honours rest, And every age Pronounce him blest. END OF THE THIRD BOOK. DIVINE SONGS ATTEMPTED IN EASY LANGUAGE, FOR THE USE OF CHILDREN, WITH SOME ADDITIONAL COMPOSURES. OUT OF THE MOUTH OF BABES AND SUCKLINGS, THOU HAST PERFECTED PRAISE. MATT. xxi. 16. SONG 1. A general Song of Praise to God. I How glorious is our heav'nly King, Who reigns above the sky! How shall a child presume to sing His dreadful majesty? II How great his pow'r is, none can tell, Nor think how large his grace; Not men below, nor saints that dwell On high before his face. III Not angels that stand round the Lord Can search his secret will; But they perform his heav'nly word, And sing his praises still. IV Then let me join this holy train, And my first off'rings bring; Th'eternal God will not disdain To hear an infant sing. V My heart resolves, my tongue obeys, And angels shall rejoice To hear their mighty Maker's praise Sound from a feeble voice. SONG 2. Praise for Creation and Providence. I I sing th'almighty power of God, That made the mountains rise, That spread the flowing seas abroad, And built the lofty skies! II I sing the wisdom that ordain'd The sun to rule the day; The moon shines full at his command And all the stars obey. III I sing the goodness of the Lord, That fill'd the earth with food; He form'd the creatures with his word, And then pronounc'd them good. IV Lord, how thy wonders are display'd, Where'er I turn my eye! If I survey the ground I tread, Or gaze upon the sky! V There's not a plant, or flower below, But makes thy glories known; And clouds arise, and tempests blow, By order from thy throne. VI Creatures (as num'rous as they be) Are subject to thy care; There's not a place where we can flee, But God is present there. VII In heaven he shines with beams of love, With wrath in hell beneath! 'Tis on his earth I stand or move, And 'tis his air I breathe. VIII His hand is my perpetual guard; He keeps me with his eye: Why should I then forget the Lord, Who is for ever nigh? SONG 3. Praise to God for our Redemption. I Blest be the wisdom, and the pow'r The justice and the grace, That join'd in counsel to restore, And save our ruin'd race. II Our father ate forbidden fruit, And from his glory fell; And we his children thus were brought To death, and near to hell. III Blest be the Lord that sent his Son To take our flesh and blood; He for our lives gave up his own, To make our peace with God. IV He honour'd all his Father's laws, Which we have disobey'd; He bore our sins upon the cross, And our full ransom paid. V Behold him rising from the grave, Behold him rais'd on high; He pleads his merit there, to save Transgressors doom'd to die. VI There on a glorious throne he reigns, And by his power divine Redeems us from the slavish chains Of Satan and of sin. VII Thence shall the Lord to judgment come, And with a sovereign voice Shall call, and break up every tomb, While waking saints rejoice. VIII O may I then with joy appear Before the Judge's face, And with the bless'd assembly there Sing his redeeming grace! SONG 4. Praise for Mercies, Spiritual and Temporal. I Whene'er I take my walks abroad, How many poor I see; What shall I render to my God For all his gifts to me? II Not more than others I deserve, Yet God hath given me more; For I have food, while others starve, Or beg from door to door. III How many children in the street Half naked I behold? While I am cloth'd from head to feet, And cover'd from the cold. IV While some poor wretches scarce can tell Where they may lay their head, I have a home wherein to dwell And rest upon my bed. V While others early learn to swear, And curse, and lie, and steal; Lord, I am taught thy name to fear, And do thy holy will. VI Are these thy favours, day by day, To me above the rest? Then let me love thee more than they, And try to serve thee best. SONG 5. Praise for Birth and Education in a Christian Land. I Great God, to thee my voice I raise, To thee my youngest hours belong; I would begin my life with praise, Till growing years improve the song. II 'Tis to thy sovereign grace I owe That I was born on British ground, Where streams of heav'nly mercy flow, And words of sweet salvation sound. III I would not change my native land For rich Peru, with all her gold; A nobler prize lies in my hand, Than East or Western Indies hold. IV How do I pity those that dwell Where ignorance and darkness reigns? They know no heav'n, they fear no hell, Those endless joys, those endless pains. V Thy glorious promises, O Lord, Kindle my hopes and my desire; While all the preachers of thy word Warn me to 'scape eternal fire. VI Thy praise shall still employ my breath, Since thou hast mark'd my way to heav'n; Nor will I run the road to death, And waste the blessings thou hast given. SONG 6. Praise for the Gospel. I Lord, I ascribe it to thy grace, And not to chance, as others do, That I was born of christian race, And not a heathen or a Jew. II What would the ancient jewish kings, And jewish prophets once have giv'n, Could they have heard these glorious things, Which Christ reveal'd and brought from heav'n? III How glad the heathens would have been, That worship'd idols, wood and stone, If they the book of God had seen, Or Jesus and his gospel known! IV Then if this gospel I refuse, How shall I e'er lift up mine eyes? For all the gentiles and the Jews Against me will in judgment rise. SONG 7. The Excellency of the Bible. I Great God, with wonder and with praise On all thy works I look; But still thy wisdom, pow'r, and grace, Shines brightest in thy book. II The stars that in their courses roll, Have much instruction giv'n; But thy good word informs my soul How I may climb to heav'n. III The fields provide me food, and shew The goodness of the Lord; But fruits of life and glory grow In thy most holy word. IV Here are my choicest treasures hid, Here my best comfort lies; Here my desires are satisfy'd, And hence my hopes arise. V Lord, make me understand thy law; Shew what my faults have been; And from thy gospel let me draw Pardon for all my sin. VI Here would I learn how Christ has dy'd To save my soul from hell: Not all the books on earth beside Such heav'nly wonders tell. VII Then let me love my Bible more, And take a fresh delight By day to read these wonders o'er, And meditate by night. SONG 8. Praise to God for learning to read. I The praises of my tongue I offer to the Lord, That I was taught, and learnt so young To read his holy word. II That I am brought to know The danger I was in, By nature and by practice too, A wretched slave to sin. III That I am led to see I can do nothing well; And whither shall a sinner flee To save himself from hell? IV Dear Lord, this book of thine Informs me where to go For grace to pardon all my sin, And make me holy too. V Here I can read and learn, How Christ, the Son of God, Did undertake our great concern; Our ransom cost his blood. VI And now he reigns above, He sends his Spirit down To shew the wonders of his love, And make his gospel known. VII O may that Spirit teach, And make my heart receive Those truths which all thy servants preach, And all thy saints believe. VIII Then shall I praise the Lord, In a more cheerful strain, That I was taught to read his word, And have not learnt in vain. SONG 9. The All-seeing God. I Almighty God, thy piercing eye Strikes thro' the shades of night; And our most secret actions lie All open to thy sight. II There's not a sin that we commit, Nor wicked word we say, But in thy dreadful book 'tis writ, Against the judgment day. III And must the crimes that I have done Be read and publish'd there? Be all expos'd before the sun, While men and angels hear? IV Lord, at thy foot asham'd I lie; Upwards I dare not look; Pardon my sins before I die, And blot them from thy book. V Remember all the dying pains That my Redeemer felt, And let his blood wash out my stains, And answer for my guilt. VI O may I now for ever fear T'indulge a sinful thought, Since the great God can see and hear, And writes down ev'ry fault. SONG 10. Solemn Thoughts of God and Death. I There is a God that reigns above, Lord of the heav'ns, and earth, and seas: I fear his wrath, I ask his love, And with my lips I sing his praise. II There is a law which he has writ, To teach us all what we must do: My soul, to his commands submit, For they are holy, just, and true. III There is a gospel of rich grace, Whence sinners all their comforts draw: Lord, I repent, and seek thy face, For I have often broke thy law. IV There is an hour when I must die, Nor do I know how soon 'twill come; A thousand children, young as I, Are call'd by death to hear their doom. V Let me improve the hours I have, Before the day of grace is fled: There's no repentance in the grave, Nor pardons offer'd to the dead. VI Just as the tree, cut down, that fell To north or southward, there it lies; So man departs to heav'n or hell, Fix'd in the state wherein he dies. SONG 11. Heaven and Hell. I There is beyond the sky A heav'n of joy and love; And holy children, when they die, Go to that world above. II There is a dreadful hell, And everlasting pains: There sinners must with devils dwell In darkness, fire, and chains. III Can such a wretch as I Escape this cursed end? And may I hope, whene'er I die, I shall to heav'n ascend? IV Then will I read and pray, While I have life and breath; Lest I should be cut off to-day, And sent t'eternal death. SONG 12. The Advantages of early Religion. I Happy the child whose tender years Receive instructions well: Who hates the sinner's path, and fears The road that leads to hell. II When we devote our youth to God, 'Tis pleasing in his eyes; A flow'r, when offer'd in the bud, Is no vain sacrifice. III 'Tis easier work, if we begin To fear the Lord betimes; While sinners that grow old in sin, Are harden'd in their crimes. IV 'Twill save us from a thousand snares, To mind religion young; Grace will preserve our following years, And make our virtue strong. V To Thee, Almighty God to Thee, Our childhood we resign; 'Twill please us to look back and see That our whole lives were thine. VI Let the sweet work of pray'r and praise Employ my youngest breath; Thus I'm prepar'd for longer days, Or fit for early death. SONG 13. The Danger of Delay. I Why should I say, ‘'Tis yet too soon ‘To seek for heav'n, or think of death?’ A flow'r may fade before 'tis noon, And I this day may lose my breath. II If this rebellious heart of mine Despise the gracious calls of heav'n; I may be harden'd in my sin, And never have repentance giv'n. III What if the Lord grow wroth and swear While I refuse to read and pray, That he'll refuse to lend an ear To all my groans another day! IV What if his dreadful anger burn, While I refuse his offer'd grace, And all his love to fury turn, And strike me dead upon the place! V 'Tis dang'rous to provoke a God! His pow'r and vengeance none can tell; One stroke of his almighty rod Shall send young sinners quick to hell. VI Then 'twill for ever be in vain To cry for pardon and for grace; To wish I had my time again, Or hope to see my Maker's face. SONG 14. Examples of early Piety. I What bless'd examples do I find, Writ in the word of truth, Of children that began to mind Religion in their youth! II Jesus, who reigns above the sky, And keeps the world in awe, Was once a child as young as I, And kept his Father's law. III At twelve years old he talk'd with men, (The Jews all wond'ring stand,) Yet he obey'd his mother then, And came at her command. IV Children a sweet hosanna sung, And blest their Saviour's name; They gave him honour with their tongue, While scribes and priests blaspheme. V Samuel the child was wean'd and brought To wait upon the Lord; Young Timothy betimes was taught To know his holy word. VI Then why should I so long delay What others learnt so soon? I would not pass another day Without this work begun. SONG 15. Against Lying. I O 'tis a lovely thing for youth To walk betimes in wisdom's way; To fear a lie, to speak the truth, That we may trust to all they say. II But liars we can never trust, Tho' they should speak the thing that's true; And he that does one fault at first, And lies to hide it, makes it two. III Have we not known, nor heard, nor read, How God abhors deceit and wrong? How Ananias was struck dead, Caught with a lie upon his tongue? IV So did his wife Sapphira die, When she came in and grew so bold As to confirm that wicked lie That just before her husband told. V The Lord delights in them that speak The words of truth; but ev'ry liar Must have his portion in the lake That burns with brimstone and with fire. VI Then let me always watch my lips, Lest I be struck to death and hell, Since God a book of reck'ning keeps For ev'ry lie that children tell. SONG 16. Against Quarrelling and Fighting. I Let dogs delight to bark and bite, For God hath made them so; Let bears and lions growl and fight, For 'tis their nature too. II But, children, you should never let Such angry passions rise; Your little hands were never made To tear each other's eyes. III Let love through all your actions run, And all your words be mild; Live like the blessed virgin's Son, That sweet and lovely child. IV His soul was gentle as a lamb; And, as his stature grew, He grew in favour both with man, And God his Father too. V Now, Lord of all, he reigns above, And from his heav'nly throne He sees what children dwell in love, And marks them for his own. SONG 17. Love between Brothers and Sisters. I Whatever brawls disturb the street, There should be peace at home; Where sisters dwell, and brothers meet, Quarrels should never come. II Birds in their little nests agree; And 'tis a shameful sight, When children of one family Fall out, and chide, and fight. III Hard names at first, and threat'ning words, That are but noisy breath, May grow to clubs and naked swords, To murder and to death. IV The devil tempts one mother's son To rage against another: So wicked Cain was hurry'd on 'Till he had kill'd his brother. V The wise will make their anger cool, At least before 'tis night; But in the bosom of a fool It burns till morning-light. VI Pardon, O Lord, our childish rage Our little brawls remove; That, as we grow to riper age, Our hearts may all be love. SONG 18. Against scoffing and calling Names. I Our tongues were made to bless the Lord, And not speak ill of men; When others give a railing word, We must not rail again. II Cross words and angry names require To be chastis'd at school; And he's in danger of hell-fire That calls his brother fool. III But lips that dare be so profane, To mock and jeer and scoff, At holy things or holy men, The Lord shall cut them off. IV When children in their wanton play Serv'd old Elisha so; And bid the prophet go his way, ‘Go up, thou bald-head, go:’ V God quickly stop'd their wicked breath, And sent two raging bears, That tore them limb from limb to death, With blood, and groans, and tears. VI Great God, how terrible art thou To sinners e'er so young; Grant me thy grace, and teach me how To tame and rule my tongue. SONG 19. Against Swearing, and Cursing, and taking God's Name in vain. I Angels, that high in glory dwell, Adore thy name, Almighty God! And devils tremble down in hell, Beneath the terrors of thy rod. II And yet, how wicked children dare, Abuse thy dreadful glorious name; And when they're angry, how they swear, And curse their fellows, and blaspheme. III How will they stand before thy face Who treated thee with such disdain, While thou shalt doom them to the place Of everlasting fire and pain? IV Then never shall one cooling drop To quench their burning tongues be giv'n; But I will praise thee here, and hope Thus to employ my tongue in heav'n. V My heart shall be in pain to hear Wretches affront the Lord above: Tis that great God whose pow'r I fear; That heav'nly Father whom I love. VI If my companions grow profane, I'll leave their friendship when I hear Young sinners take thy name in vain, And learn to curse and learn to swear. SONG 20. Against Idleness and Mischief. I How doth the little busy bee Improve each shining hour, And gather honey all the day From every op'ning flow'r! II How skilfully she builds her cell! How neat she spreads the wax! And labours hard to store it well With the sweet food she makes. III In works of labour, or of skill, I would be busy too; For Satan finds some mischief still For idle hands to do. IV In books, or work, or healthful play, Let my first years be past; That I may give for ev'ry day Some good account at last. SONG 21. Against Evil Company. I Why should I join with those in play In whom I've no delight Who curse and swear, but never pray; Who call ill names and fight? II I hate to hear a wanton song, Their words offend my ears; I should not dare defile my tongue With language such as theirs. III Away from fools I'll turn mine eyes; Nor with the scoffers go: I would be walking with the wise, That wiser I may grow. IV From one rude boy that's us'd to mock, They learn the wicked jest: One sickly sheep infects the flock, And poisons all the rest. V My God, I hate to walk or dwell With sinful children here: Then let me not be sent to hell, Where none but sinners are. SONG 22. Against Pride in Clothes. I Why should our garments made to hide Our parents shame, provoke our pride? The art of dress did ne'er begin, Till Eve our mother learnt to sin. II When first she put the cov'ring on, Her robe of innocence was gone; And yet her children vainly boast In the sad marks of glory lost. III How proud we are! how fond to shew Our clothes, and call them rich and new! When the poor sheep and silk-worm wore That very clothing long before. IV The tulip and the butterfly Appear in gayer coats than I: Let me be drest fine as I will, Flies, worms and flowers, exceed me still. V Then will I set my heart to find Inward adornings of the mind; Knowledge and virtue, truth and grace: These are the robes of richest dress. VI No more shall worms with me compare, This is the raiment angels wear; The Son of God, when here below, Put on this blest apparel too. VII It never fades, it ne'er grows old, Nor fears the rain, nor moth, nor mould: It takes no spot, but still refines, The more 'tis worn, the more it shines. VIII In this on earth would I appear, Then go to heaven, and wear it there: God will approve it in his sight, 'Tis his own work, and his delight. SONG 23. Obedience to Parents. I Let children that would fear the Lord Hear what their teachers say; With rev'rence meet their parents word, And with delight obey. II Have you not heard what dreadful plagues Are threaten'd by the Lord To him that breaks his father's law, Or mocks his mother's word? III What heavy guilt upon him lies! How cursed is his name! The ravens shall pick out his eyes, And eagles eat the same. IV But those who worship God, and give Their parents honour due; Here on this earth they long shall live, And live hereafter too. SONG 24. The Child's Complaint. I Why should I love my sport so well, So constant at my play, And lose the thoughts of heaven and hell, And then forget to pray! II What do I read my Bible for, But, Lord, to learn thy will? And shall I daily know thee more, And less obey thee still? III How senseless is my heart, and wild! How vain are all my thoughts! Pity the weakness of a child, And pardon all my faults. IV Make me thy heav'nly voice to hear, And let me love to pray; Since God will lend a gracious ear To what a child can say. SONG 25. A Morning Song. I My God, who makes the sun to know His proper hour to rise; And to give light to all below, Doth send him round the skies! II When from the chambers of the East His morning race begins, He never tires, nor stops to rest, But round the world he shines; III So, like the sun, would I fulfil The business of the day: Begin my work betimes, and still March on my heav'nly way. IV Give me, O Lord, thy early grace, Nor let my soul complain That the young morning of my days Has all been spent in vain! SONG 26. An Evening Song. I And now another day is gone, I'll sing my Maker's praise; My comforts ev'ry hour make known His providence and grace. II But how my childhood runs to waste! My sins, how great their sum! Lord, give me pardon for the past, And strength for days to come. III I lay my body down to sleep, Let angels guard my head; And through the hours of darkness keep Their watch around my bed. IV With cheerful heart I close my eyes, Since thou wilt not remove; And in the morning let me rise Rejoicing in thy love. SONG 27. For the Lord's Day Morning. I This is the day when Christ arose, So early from the dead; Why should I keep my eye-lids clos'd, And waste my hours in bed? II This is the day when Jesus broke The pow'r of death and hell; And shall I still wear Satan's yoke, And love my sins so well? III To-day with pleasure christians meet, To pray and hear thy word: And I would go with cheerful feet To learn thy will, O Lord. IV I'll leave my sport to read and pray, And so prepare for heav'n; O may I love this blessed day The best of all the sev'n! SONG 28. For the Lord's Day Evening. I Lord, how delightful 'tis to see A whole assembly worship thee! At once they sing, at once they pray! They hear of heav'n and learn the way. II I have been there, and still would go; 'Tis like a little heaven below: Not all my pleasure and my play Shall tempt me to forget this day. III O write upon my mem'ry, Lord, The texts and doctrines of thy word; That I may break thy laws no more, But love thee better than before. IV With thoughts of Christ, and things divine, Fill up this foolish heart of mine; That hoping pardon thro' his blood, I may lie down and wake with God. The Ten Commandments, out of the Old Testament, put into short Rhyme for Children. Exodus xx. 1. Thou shalt have no more Gods but me. 2. Before no idol bow thy knee. 3. Take not the name of God in vain. 4. Nor dare the sabbath day profane. 5. Give both thy parents honour due. 6. Take heed that thou no murder do. 7. Abstain from words and deeds unclean. 8. Nor steal, tho' thou art poor and mean. 9. Nor make a wilful lie, nor love it. 10. What is thy neighbour's dare not covet. The Sum of the Commandments, out of the New Testament. Matt. xxii. 37. With all thy soul love God above. And, as thyself thy neighbour love. Our Saviour's Golden Rule. Matt. vii. 12. Be you to others kind and true, As you'd have others be to you; And neither do nor say to men Whate'er you would not take again. Duty to God and our Neighbour. Love God with all your soul and strength, With all your heart and mind: And love your neighbour as yourself; Be faithful, just, and kind. Deal with another as you'd have Another deal with you; What you're unwilling to receive, Be sure you never do. Out of my Book of Hymns I have here added the Hosanna, and Glory to the Father, &amp;c. to be sung at the end of any of these Songs, according to the direction of Parents or Governors. The Hosanna; or, Salvation ascribed to Christ. Long Metre. I Hosanna to King David's Son, Who reigns on a superior throne; We bless the Prince of heav'nly birth, Who brings salvation down to earth. II Let ev'ry nation, ev'ry age, In this delightful work engage; Old men and babes in Sion sing The growing glories of her King! Common Metre. I Hosanna to the Prince of Grace, Sion, behold thy King! Proclaim the Son of David's race, And teach the babes to sing. II Hosanna to th'eternal word, Who from the Father came; Ascribe salvation to the Lord, With blessings on his name. Short Metre. I Hosanna to the Son Of David and of God, Who brought the news of pardon down, And bought it with his blood. II To Christ th'anointed King, Be endless blessings giv'n; Let the whole earth his glory sing, Who made our peace with heav'n. Glory to the Father, and to the Son. &amp;c. Long Metre. To God the Father, God the Son, And God the Spirit, Three in One, Be honour, praise, and glory giv'n, By all on earth, and all in heav'n. Common Metre. Now let the Father, and the Son, And Spirit be ador'd, Where there are works to make him known, Or saints to love the Lord. Short Metre. Give to the Father praise, Give glory to the Son; And to the Spirit of his grace Be equal honour done. A SLIGHT SPECIMEN OF MORAL SONGS: SUCH AS I WISH SOME HAPPY AND CONDESCENDING GENIUS WOULD UNDERTAKE FOR THE USE OF CHILDREN, AND PERFORM MUCH BETTER. The sense and subject might be borrowed plentifully from the Proverbs of Solomon, from all the common appearances of nature, from all the occurrences in civil life, both in city and country: (which would also afford matter for other divine songs.) Here the language and measures should be easy, and flowing with cheerfulness, with or without the solemnities of religion, or the sacred names of God and holy things; that children might find delight and profit together. This would be one effectual way to deliver them from the temptations of loving or learning those idle, wanton, or profane songs, which give so early an ill taint to the fancy and memory, and become the seeds of future vices. SONG 1.—The Sluggard. I 'Tis the voice of the sluggard; I heard him complain, ‘You have wak'd me too soon, I must slumber again;’ As the door on its hinges, so he on his bed, Turns his sides, and his shoulders, and his heavy head. II ‘A little more sleep and a little more slumber;’ Thus he wastes half his days, and his hours without number; And when he gets up, he sits folding his hands, Or walks about sauntring, or trifling he stands. III I pass'd by his garden, and saw the wild brier, The thorn and the thistle grow broader and higher: The clothes that hang on him are turning to rags; And his money still wastes, till he starves or he begs. IV I made him a visit, still hoping to find, He had took better care for improving his mind: He told me his dreams, talk'd of eating and drinking: But he scarce reads his Bible, and never loves thinking. V Said I then to my heart, ‘Here's a lesson for me;’ That man's but a picture of what I might be: But thanks to my friends for their care in my breeding, Who taught me betimes to love working and reading. SONG 2.—Innocent Play. I Abroad in the meadows to see the young lambs, Run sporting about by the side of their dams, With fleeces so clean and so white; Or a nest of young doves in a large open cage, When they play all in love, without anger or rage, How much we may learn from the sight! II If we had been ducks, we might dabble in mud, Or dogs, we might play till it ended in blood; So foul and so fierce are their natures: But Thomas and William, and such pretty names, Should be cleanly and harmless as doves or as lambs, Those lovely sweet innocent creatures. III Not a thing that we do, nor a word that we say, Should hinder another in jesting or play; For he's still in earnest that's hurt: How rude are the boys that throw pebbles and mire! There's none but a madman will fling about fire, And tell you, ‘'Tis all but in sport.’ SONG 3.—The Rose. I How fair is the rose! what a beautiful flow'r! The glory of April and May! But the leaves are beginning to fade in an hour, And they wither and die in a day. II Yet the rose has one powerful virtue to boast, Above all the flowers of the field; When its leaves are all dead, &amp; fine colours are lost, Still how sweet a perfume it will yield! III So frail is the youth and the beauty of men, Tho' they bloom and look gay like the rose; But all our fond care to preserve them is vain; Time kills them as fast he goes. IV Then I'll not be proud of my youth or my beauty, Since both of them wither and fade; But gain a good name by well doing my duty; This will scent like a rose when I'm dead. SONG 4.—The Thief. I Why should I deprive my neighbour Of his goods against his will? Hands were made for honest labour, Not to plunder or to steal. II 'Tis a foolish self-deceiving By such tricks to hope for gain: All that's ever got by thieving, Turns to sorrow, shame, and pain. III Have not Eve and Adam taught us Their sad profit to compute? To what dismal state they brought us, When they stole forbidden fruit? IV Oft we see a young beginner Practise little pilf'ring ways, Till grown up a harden'd sinner: Then the gallows ends his days. V Theft will not be always hidden, Though we fancy none can spy: When we take a thing forbidden, God beholds it with his eye. VI Guard my heart, O God of heaven, Lest I covet what's not mine: Lest I steal what is not given, Guard my heart and hands from sin. SONG 5.—The Ant or Emmet. I These emmets, how little they are in our eyes! We tread them to dust, and a troop of them dies, Without our regard or concern: Yet as wise as we are, if we went to their school, There's many a sluggard and many a fool, Some lessons of wisdom might learn. II They dont wear their time out in sleeping or play, But gather up corn in a sun-shiny day, And for winter they lay up their stores: They manage their work in such regular forms, One would think they foresaw all the frost and the storms, And so brought their food within doors. III But I have less sense than a poor creeping ant, If I take not due care for the things I shall want, Nor provide against dangers in time: When death or old age shall stare in my face, What a wretch shall I be in the end of my days, If I trifle away all my prime! IV Now, now, while my strength and my youth are in bloom, Let me think what will serve me when sickness shall come, And pray that my sins be forgiv'n: Let me read in good books, and believe and obey, That, when death turns me out of this cottage of clay, I may dwell in a palace in heav'n. SONG 6.—Good Resolutions. I Though I'm now in younger days, Nor can tell what shall befal me, I'll prepare for every place Where my growing age shall call me. II Should I e'er be rich or great, Others shall partake my goodness; I'll supply the poor with meat, Never shewing scorn or rudeness. III Where I see the blind or lame, Deaf or dumb, I'll kindly treat them; I deserve to feel the same If I mock or hurt or cheat them. IV If I meet with railing tongues, Why should I return them railing, Since I best revenge my wrongs By my patience never failing! V When I hear them telling lies, Talking foolish, cursing, swearing; First I'll try to make them wise, Or I'll soon go out of hearing. VI What though I be low and mean, I'll engage the rich to love me, While I'm modest, neat, and clean, And submit when they reprove me. VII If I should be poor and sick, I shall meet, I hope with pity; Since I love to help the weak, Though they're neither fair nor witty. VIII I'll not willingly offend; Nor be easily offended; What's amiss I'll strive to mend, And endure what can't be mended. IX May I be so watchful still O'er my humours and my passion, As to speak and do no ill, Though it should be all the fashion. X Wicked fashions lead to hell; Ne'er may I be found complying; But in life behave so well, Not to be afraid of dying. SONG 7.—A Summer Evening. I How fine has the day been, how bright was the sun, How lovely and joyful the course that he run, Though he rose in a mist when his race he begun, And there follow'd some droppings of rain! But now the fair traveller's come to the West, His rays are all gold, and his beauties are best, He paints the sky gay as he sinks to his rest, And foretels a bright rising again. II Just such is the christian: his course he begins, Like the sun in a mist, when he mourns for his sins, And melts into tears: then he breaks out and shines, And travels his heav'nly way; But when he comes nearer to finish his race, Like a fine setting sun he looks richer in grace, And gives a sure hope at the end of his days, Of rising in brighter array. Some Copies of the following Hymn having got abroad already into several Hands, the Author has been persuaded to permit it to appear in Public, at the end of these Songs for Children. A Cradle Hymn. I Hush! my dear, lie still and slumber, Holy angels guard thy bed! Heavenly blessings, without number, Gently falling on thy head. II Sleep my babe; thy food and raiment, House and home thy friends provide; All without thy care or payment, All thy wants are well supply'd. III How much better thou'rt attended Than the Son of God could be; When from heaven he descended, And became a child like thee! IV Soft and easy is thy cradle, Coarse and hard thy Saviour lay; When his birth-place was a stable, And his softest bed was hay. V Blessed babe! what glorious features, Spotless fair, divinely bright! Must he dwell with brutal creatures! How could angels bear the sight! VI Was there nothing but a manger Cursed sinners could afford, To receive the heav'nly stranger! Did they thus affront their Lord! VII Soft, my child; I did not chide thee, Tho' my song might sound too hard, 'Tis thy Here you may use the words brother, sister, neighbour, friend, &amp;c. Mother/Nurse that sits beside thee, And her arms shall be thy guard. VIII Yet to read the shameful story, How the Jews abus'd their King; How they serv'd the Lord of glory, Makes me angry while I sing. IX See the kinder shepherds round him, Telling wonders from the sky! Where they sought him, there they found him, With his virgin mother by. X See the lovely babe a dressing; Lovely infant, how he smil'd! When he wept, the mother's blessing Sooth'd and hush'd the holy child. XI Lo, he slumbers in his manger, Where the horned oxen fed; Peace, my darling, here's no danger, Here's no ox a-near thy bed. XII 'Twas to save thee, child, from dying, Save my dear from burning flame, Bitter groans and endless crying, That thy blest Redeemer came. XIII May'st thou live to know and fear him, Trust and love him all thy days; Then go dwell for ever near him, See his face, and sing his praise! XIV I could give thee thousand kisses, Hoping what I most desire; Not a mother's fondest wishes Can to greater joys aspire!</field>

WATTS'S POEMS SACRED TO PIETY AND DEVOTION. ‘Regard the man, who, in seraphic lays, ‘And flowing numbers, sings his Maker's praise: ‘He needs invoke no fabled muse's art, ‘The heav'nly song comes genuine from his heart, ‘From that pure heart, which God has deign'd t'inspire ‘With holy raptures, and a sacred fire. ‘Thrice happy man! whose soul, and guiltless breast, ‘Are well prepar'd to lodge th'almighty guest! ‘'Tis he that lends thy tow'ring thoughts their wing, ‘And tunes thy lyre, when thou attempt'st to sing: ‘He to thy soul lets in celestial day, ‘Ev'n whilst imprison'd in this mortal clay. ‘By death's grim aspect thou art not alarm'd, ‘He, for thy sake, has death itself disarm'd; ‘Nor shall the grave o'er thee a vict'ry boast; ‘Her triumph in thy rising shall be lost, ‘When thou shalt join th'angelic choirs above, ‘In never-ending songs of praise and love.’ EUSEBIA. TO DR. WATTS, On his Poems sacred to Devotion. I ‘To murmuring streams, in tender strains, ‘My pensive muse no more ‘Of love's enchanting force complains, ‘Along the flow'ry shore. II ‘No more Mirtillo's fatal face ‘My quiet breast alarms; ‘His eyes, his air, and youthful grace, ‘Have lost their usual charms. III ‘No gay Alexis in the grove ‘Shall be my future theme: ‘I burn with an immortal love, ‘And sing a purer flame. IV ‘Seraphic heights I seem to gain, ‘And sacred transports feel, ‘While, WATTS, to thy celestial strain, ‘Surpris'd I listen still. V ‘The gliding streams their course forbear, ‘When I thy lays repeat; ‘The bending forest lends an ear; ‘The birds their notes forget. VI ‘With such a graceful harmony ‘Thy numbers still prolong; ‘And let remotest lands reply, ‘And echo to thy song; VII ‘Far as the distant regions, where ‘The beauteous morning springs, ‘And scatters odours through the air, ‘From her resplendent wings; VIII ‘Unto the new-found realms, which see ‘The latter sun arise, ‘When, with an easy progress, he ‘Rolls down the nether skies.’ PHILOMELA. July, 1706. TO DR. WATTS, On reading his Horæ Lyricæ. ‘Hail, heav'n-born muse! that with celestial flame, ‘And high seraphic numbers, durst attempt ‘To gain thy native skies. No common theme ‘Merits thy thought, self-conscious of a soul ‘Superior, though on earth detain'd a while; ‘Like some propitious angel that's design'd ‘A resident in this inferior orb, ‘To guide the wand'ring souls to heavenly bliss. ‘Thou seem'st; while thou their everlasting songs ‘Hast sung to mortal ears, and down to earth ‘Transfer'd the work of heaven; with thought sublime, ‘And high sonorous words, thou sweetly sing'st ‘To thy immortal lyre. Amaz'd, we view ‘The tow'ring height stupendous, while thou soar'st ‘Above the reach of vulgar eyes or thought, ‘Hymning th'eternal Father; as of old ‘When first th'Almighty from the dark abyss ‘Of everlasting night and silence call'd ‘The shining worlds with one creating word, ‘And rais'd from nothing all the heavenly hosts, ‘And with external glories fill'd the void, ‘Harmonious seraphs tun'd their golden harps, ‘And with their cheerful Hallelujahs bless'd ‘The bounteous Author of their happiness; ‘From orb to orb th'alternate music rang, ‘And from the chrystal arches of the sky ‘Reach'd our then glorious world, the native seat ‘Of the first happy pair, who join'd their songs ‘To the loud echoes of th'angelic choirs, ‘And fill'd with blissful hymns, terrestrial heaven, ‘The paradise of God where all delights ‘Abounded, and the pure ambrosial air, ‘Fann'd by mild zephyrs, breath'd eternal sweets, ‘Forbidding death and sorrow, and bestow'd ‘Fresh heavenly bloom, and gay immortal youth. ‘Not so, alas! the vile apostate race, ‘Who in mad joys their brutal hours employ'd, ‘Assaulting with their impious blasphemies ‘The power supreme that gave 'em life and breath; ‘Incarnate fiends! outrageous they defy'd ‘Th'eternal thunder, and almighty wrath ‘Fearless provok'd, which all the other devils ‘Would dread to meet; remembering well the day ‘When driven from pure immortal seats above, ‘A fiery tempest hurl'd 'em down the skies, ‘And hung upon the rear, urging their fall ‘To the dark, deep, unfathomable gulph, ‘Where bound on sulph'rous lakes to glowing rocks ‘With adamantine chains, they wail their woes, ‘And know Jehovah great as well as good; ‘And fix'd for ever by eternal fate, ‘With horror find his arm omnipotent. ‘Prodigious madness! that the sacred muse, ‘First taught in heaven to mount immortal heights, ‘And trace the boundless glories of the sky, ‘Should now to ev'ry idol basely bow, ‘And curse the deity she once ador'd, ‘Erecting trophies to each sordid vice, ‘And celebrating the infernal praise ‘Of haughty Lucifer, the desperate foe ‘Of God and man, and winning every hour ‘New votaries to hell, while all the fiends ‘Hear these accursed lays, and thus outdone, ‘Raging they try to match the human race, ‘Redoubling all their hellish blasphemies, ‘And with loud curses rend the gloomy vault. ‘Ungrateful mortals! ah! too late you'll find ‘What 'tis to banter heav'n and laugh at hell; ‘To dress up vice in false delusive charms, ‘And with gay colours paint her hideous face, ‘Leading besotted souls thro' flow'ry paths, ‘In gaudy dreams, and vain fantastic joys, ‘To dismal scenes of everlasting woe; ‘When the great Judge shall rear his awful throne, ‘And raging flames surround the trembling globe, ‘While the loud thunders roar from pole to pole, ‘And the last trump awakes the sleeping dead; ‘And guilty souls to ghastly bodies driven, ‘Within those dire eternal prisons shut, ‘Expect their sad inexorable doom. ‘Say now, ye men of wit! What turn of thought ‘Will please you then! Alas, how dull and poor, ‘Ev'n to yourselves will your lewd flights appear! ‘How will you envy then the happy fate ‘Of idiots! and perhaps in vain you'll wish, ‘You'd been as very fools as once you thought ‘Others, for the sublimest wisdom scorn'd; ‘When pointed lightnings from the wrathful Judge ‘Shall singe your laurels, and the men ‘Who thought they flew so high, shall fall so low. ‘No more, my muse, of that tremendous thought, ‘Resume thy more delightful theme, and sing ‘Th'immortal man, that with immortal verse ‘Rivals the hymns of angels, and like them ‘Despises mortal critics idle rules: ‘While the celestial flame that warms thy soul ‘Inspires us, and with holy transports moves ‘Our labouring minds, and nobler scenes presents ‘Than all the pagan poets ever sung. ‘Homer or Virgil; and far sweeter notes ‘Than Horace ever taught his sounding lyre, ‘And purer far, tho' Martial's self might seem ‘A modest poet in our christian days. ‘May those forgotten and neglected lie, ‘No more let man be fond of fab'lous gods, ‘Nor heathen wit debauch one christian line, ‘While with the coarse and daubing paint we hide ‘The shining beauties of eternal truth, ‘That in her native dress appears most bright, ‘And charms the eyes of angels,—Oh! like thee ‘Let every nobler genius tune his voice ‘To subjects worthy of their tow'ring thoughts ‘Let HEAVEN and Anna then your tuneful art ‘Improve, and consecrate your deathless lays ‘To him who reigns above, and her who rules below.’ JOSEPH STANDEN. April 17, 1706. TO DR. WATTS, On his Divine Poems. ‘Say, human seraph, whence that charming force, ‘That flame! that soul! which animates each line; ‘And how it runs with such a graceful ease, ‘Loaded with pond'rous sense! Say, did not he ‘The lovely Jesus, who commands thy breast, ‘Inspire thee with himself? With Jesus dwells, ‘Knit in mysterious bands, the paraclete, ‘The breath of God, the everlasting source ‘Of love: And what is love in souls like thine, ‘But air, and incense to the poet's fire? ‘Should an expiring saint whose swimming eyes ‘Mingle the images of things about him, ‘But hear the least exalted of thy strains, ‘How greedily he'd drink the music in, ‘Thinking his heavenly convoy waited near! ‘So great a stress of powerful harmony, ‘Nature unable longer to sustain, ‘Would sink oppress'd with joy to endless rest. ‘Let none henceforth of Providence complain, ‘As if the world of spirits lay unknown, ‘Fenc'd round with black impenetrable night; ‘What tho' no shining angel darts from thence ‘With leave to publish things conceal'd from sense, ‘In language bright as theirs, we are here told, ‘When life its narrow round of years hath roll'd, ‘What 'tis employs the bless'd, what makes their bliss; ‘Songs such as WATTS's are, and love like his. ‘But then, dear Sir, be cautious how you use, ‘To transports so intensely rais'd your muse, ‘Lest, whilst th'ecstatic impulse you obey, ‘The soul leap out, and drop the duller clay.’ HENRY GROVE. Sept. 4, 1706. TO DR. WATTS, On the Fifth Edition of his Horæ Lyricæ. ‘Sovereign of sacred verse, accept the lays ‘Of a young bard that dares attempt thy praise, ‘A muse, the meanest of the vocal throng, ‘New to the bays, nor equal to the song, ‘Fir'd with the growing glories of thy fame ‘Joins all her powers to celebrate thy name. ‘No vulgar themes thy pious muse engage, ‘No scenes of lust pollute thy sacred page. ‘You in majestic numbers mount the skies, ‘And meet descending angels as you rise, ‘Whose just applauses charm the crowded groves, ‘And Addison thy tuneful song approves. ‘Soft harmony and manly vigour join ‘To form the beauties of each sprightly line, ‘For every grace of every muse is thine. ‘Milton, immortal bard, divinely bright, ‘Conducts his fav'rite to the realms of light; ‘Where Raphael's lyre charms the celestial throng, ‘Delighted cherubs list'ning to the song: ‘From bliss to bliss the happy beings rove, ‘And taste the sweets of music and of love. ‘But when the softer scenes of life you paint, ‘And join the beauteous virgin to the saint, ‘When you describe how few the happy pairs, ‘Whose hearts united soften all their cares, ‘We see to whom the sweetest joys belong, ‘And Mira's beauties consecrate your song. ‘Fain the unnumber'd graces I would tell, ‘And on the pleasing theme for ever dwell; ‘But the muse faints, unequal to the flight, ‘And hears thy strains with wonder and delight. ‘When tombs of princes shall in ruins lie, ‘And all, but heaven-born piety, shall die, ‘When the last trumpet wakes the silent dead, ‘And each lascivious poet hides his head, ‘With thee shall thy divine Urania rise, ‘Crown'd with fresh laurels, to thy native skies: ‘Great How and Gouge shall hail thee on thy way, ‘And welcome thee to the bright realms of day, ‘Adapt thy tuneful notes to heavenly strings, ‘And join the Lyric Ode while some fair seraph sings.’ Sic spirat, sic optat Tui amantissimus, BRITANNICUS. BOOK I. SACRED TO DEVOTION AND PIETY. Worshipping with Fear. I Who dares attempt th'eternal name With notes of mortal sound? Dangers and glories guard the theme, And spread despair around. II Destruction waits t'obey his frown, And heav'n attends his smile: A wreath of lightning arms his crown, But love adorns it still. III Celestial King, our spirits lie, Trembling beneath thy feet, And wish, and cast a longing eye, To reach thy lofty seat. IV When shall we see the great Unknown, And in thy presence stand? Reveal the splendors of thy throne, But shield us with thy hand. V In thee what endless wonders meet! What various glory shines! The crossing rays too fiercely beat Upon our fainting minds. VI Angels are lost in sweet surprise If thou unveil thy grace; And humble awe runs thro' the skies, When wrath arrays thy face. VII When mercy joins with majesty To spread their beams abroad, Not all their fairest minds on high Are shadows of a God. VIII Thy works the strongest seraph sings In a too feeble strain, And labours hard on all his strings To reach thy thoughts in vain. IX Created powers, how weak they be! How short our praises fall! So much a-kin to nothing we, And thou th'eternal All. Asking Leave to Sing. I Yet, mighty God, indulge my tongue, Nor let thy thunders roar, Whilst the young notes and vent'rous song To worlds of glory soar. II If thou my darling flight forbid The muse folds up her wings; Or at thy word her slender reed Attempts almighty things. III Her slender reed inspir'd by thee Bids a new Eden grow, With blooming life on every tree, And spreads a heav'n below. IV She mocks the trumpet's loud alarms Fill'd with thy dreadful breath; And calls th'angelic hosts to arms, To give the nations death. V But when she tastes her Saviour's love, And feels the rapture strong, Scarce the divinest harp above Aims at a sweeter song. Divine Judgments. I. Not from the dust my sorrows spring, Nor drop my comforts from the lower skies: Let all the baneful planets shed Their mingled curses on my head, How vain their curses, if th'eternal King Look thro' the clouds and bless me with his eyes. Creatures with all their boasted sway Are but his slaves, and must obey; They wait their orders from above, And execute his word, the vengeance, or the love. II. 'Tis by a warrant from his hand The gentler gales are bound to sleep: The north wind blusters, and assumes command Over the desart and the deep; Old Boreas with his freezing pow'rs Turns the earth iron, makes the ocean glass, Arrests the dancing riv'lets as they pass, And chains them moveless to their shores; The grazing ox lows to the gelid skies, Walks o'er the marble meads with withering eyes, Walks o'er the solid lakes, snuffs up the wind, and dies. III. Fly to the polar world, my song, And mourn the pilgrims there, (a wretched throng!) Seiz'd and bound in rigid chains, A troop of statues on the Russian plains, And life stands frozen in the purple veins. Atheist, forbear; no more blaspheme: God has a thousand terrors in his name, A thousand armies at command, Waiting the signal of his hand, And magazines of frost, and magazines of flame. Dress thee in steel to meet his wrath; His sharp artillery from the north Shall pierce thee to the soul, and shake thy mortal frame. Sublime on winter's rugged wings He rides in arms along the sky, And scatters fate on swains and kings; And flocks and herds, and nations die; While impious lips, profanely bold, Grow pale; and, quivering at his dreadful cold, Give their own blasphemies the lie. IV. The mischiefs that infest the earth, When the hot dog-star fires the realms on high, Drought and disease, and cruel dearth, Are but the flashes of a wrathful eye From the incens'd divinity. In vain our parching palates thirst, For vital food in vain we cry, And pant for vital breath; The verdant fields are burnt to dust, The sun has drunk the channels dry, And all the air is death. Ye scourges of our Maker's rod, 'Tis at his dread command, at his imperial nod You deal your various plagues abroad. V. Hail, whirlwinds, hurricanes and floods That all the leafy standards strip, And bear down with a mighty sweep The riches of the fields, and honours of the wood; Storms, that ravage o'er the deep, And bury millions in the waves; Earthquakes, that in midnight-sleep Turn cities into heaps, and make our beds our graves? While you dispense your mortal harms, 'Tis the Creator's voice that sounds your loud alarms, When guilt with louder cries provokes a God to arms. VI. O for a message from above To bear my spirits up! Some pledge of my Creator's love To calm my terrors, and support my hope! Let waves and thunders mix and roar, Be thou my God, and the whole world is mine: While thou art sov'reign, I'm secure; I shall be rich till thou art poor; For all I fear, and all I wish, heav'n, earth and hell are thine. Earth and Heaven. I. Hast thou not seen, impatient boy? Hast thou not read the solemn truth, That gray experience writes for giddy youth On every mortal joy? ‘Pleasure must be dash'd with pain:’ And yet with heedless haste, The thirsty boy repeats the taste, Nor hearkens to despair, but tries the bowl again, The rills of pleasure never run sincere; (Earth has no unpolluted spring) From the curs'd soil some dang'rous taint they bear; So roses grow on thorns, and honey wears a sting. II. In vain we seek a heaven below the sky; The world has false, but flatt'ring charms; Its distant joys shew big in our esteem, But lessen still as they draw near the eye; In our embrace the visions die, And when we grasp the airy forms We lose the pleasing dream. III. Earth, with her scenes of gay delight, Is but a landscape rudely drawn, With glaring colours and false light; Distance commends it to the sight, For fools to gaze upon; But bring the nauseous daubing nigh, Coarse and confus'd the hideous figures lie, Dissolve the pleasure, and offend the eye. IV. Look up, my soul, pant tow'rd th'eternal hills; Those heav'ns are fairer than they seem; There pleasures all sincere glide on in crystal rills, There not a dreg of guilt defiles, Nor grief disturbs the stream. That Canaan knows no noxious thing, No cursed soil, no tainted spring, Nor roses grow on thorns, nor honey wears a sting. Felicity Above. I No, 'tis in vain to seek for bliss; For bliss can ne'er be found Till we arrive where Jesus is, And tread on heav'nly ground. II There's nothing round these painted skies, Or round this dusty clod; Nothing, my soul, that's worth thy joys, Or lovely as thy God. III 'Tis heav'n on earth to taste his love, To feel his quick'ning grace; And all the heav'n I hope above Is but to see his face. IV Why move my years in slow delay? O God of ages! why? Let the spheres cleave, and mark my way To the superior sky. V Dear sov'reign, break these vital strings That bind me to my clay; Take me, Uriel, on thy wings, And stretch and soar away. God's Dominion and Decrees. I Keep silence, all created things, And wait your Maker's nod: The muse stands trembling while she sings The honours of her God. II Life, death, and hell, and worlds unknown Hang on his firm decree: He sits on no precarious throne, Nor borrows leave to be. III Th'almighty voice bid ancient night Her endless realms resign, And lo, ten thousand globes of light In fields of azure shine. IV Now wisdom with superior sway Guides the vast moving frame, Whilst all the ranks of beings pay Deep rev'rence to his name. V He spake: The sun obedient stood, And held the falling day: Old Jordan backward drives his flood, And disappoints the sea. VI Lord of the armies of the sky, He marshals all the stars; Red comets lift their banners high, And wide proclaim his wars. VII Chain'd to his throne a volume lies, With all the fates of men, With every angel's form and size Drawn by th'eternal pen. VIII His providence unfolds the book, And makes his counsels shine: Each opening leaf, and every stroke, Fulfils some deep design. IX Here he exalts neglected worms To sceptres and a crown; Anon the following page he turns, And treads the monarchs down. X Not Gabriel asks the reason why, Nor God the reason gives; Nor dares the favourite-angel pry Between the folded leaves. XI My God, I never long'd to see My fate with curious eyes, What gloomy lines are writ for me, Or what bright scenes shall rise. XII In thy fair book of life and grace May I but find my name, Recorded in some humble place Beneath my Lord the Lamb. Self-Consecration. I It grieves me, Lord, it grieves me sore, That I have liv'd to thee no more, And wasted half my days; My inward pow'rs shall burn and flame With zeal and passion for thy name, I would not speak, but for my God, nor move, but to his praise. II What are my eyes but aids to see The glories of the deity Inscrib'd with beams of light On flow'rs and stars? Lord, I behold The shining azure, green and gold; But when I try to read thy name, a dimness veils my sight. III Mine ears are rais'd when Virgil sings Sicilian swains, or Trojan kings, And drink the music in; Why should the trumpet's brazen voice, Or oaten reed awake my joys, And yet my heart so stupid lie when sacred hymns begin. IV Change me, O God; my flesh shall be An instrument of song to thee, And thou the notes inspire: My tongue shall keep the heav'nly chime, My cheerful pulse shall beat the time, And sweet variety of sound shall in thy praise conspire. V The dearest nerve about my heart, Should it refuse to bear a part, With my melodious breath, I'd tear away the vital cord, A bloody victim to my Lord, And live without that impious string, or show my zeal in death. The Creator and Creatures. I God is a name my soul adores, Th'almighty Three, th'eternal One; Nature and grace, with all their pow'rs, Confess the infinite Unknown. II From thy great self thy being springs: Thou art thy own original, Made up of uncreated things, And self-sufficience bears them all. III Thy voice produc'd the seas and spheres, Bid the waves roar, and planets shine; But nothing like thyself appears, Thro' all these spacious works of thine. IV Still restless nature dies and grows; From change to change the creatures run: Thy being no succession knows, And all thy vast designs are one. V A glance of thine runs thro' the globes, Rules the bright world, and moves their frame: Broad sheets of light compose thy robes; Thy guards are form'd of living flame. VI Thrones and dominions round thee fall, And worship in submissive forms; Thy presence shakes this lower ball, This little dwelling-place of worms. VII How shall affrighted mortals dare To sing thy glory or thy grace, Beneath thy feet we lie so far, And see but shadows of thy face? VIII Who can behold the blazing light; Who can approach consuming flame? None but thy wisdom knows thy might; None but thy word can speak thy name. The Nativity of Christ. I ‘Shepherds, rejoice, lift up your eyes, ‘And send your fears away; ‘News from the region of the skies, ‘Salvation's born to-day. II ‘Jesus, the God whom angels fear, ‘Comes down to dwell with you; ‘To-day he makes his entrance here, ‘But not as monarchs do. III ‘No gold, nor purple swaddling bands, ‘Nor royal shining things; ‘A manger for his cradle stands ‘And holds the King of kings. IV ‘Go, shepherds, where the infant lies, ‘And see his humble throne; ‘With tears of joy in all your eyes, ‘Go, shepherds, kiss the Son.’ V Thus Gabriel sang, and straight around The heav'nly armies throng; They tune their harps to lofty sound, And thus conclude the song: VI ‘Glory to God that reigns above, ‘Let peace surround the earth; ‘Mortals shall know their Maker's love, ‘At their Redeemer's birth.’ VII Lord! and shall angels have their songs, And men no tunes to raise? O may we lose these useless tongues When they forget to praise! VIII Glory to God that reigns above, That pitied us forlorn, We join to sing our Maker's love, For there's a Saviour born. God glorious, and Sinners saved. I Father, how wide thy glory shines! How high thy wonders rise! Known through the earth by thousand signs, By thousand thro' the skies. II Those mighty orbs proclaim thy pow'r, Their motions speak thy skill; And on the wings of every hour, We read thy patience still. III Part of thy name divinely stands On all thy creatures writ, They show the labour of thine hands, Or impress of thy feet. IV But when we view thy strange design To save rebellious worms, Where vengeance and compassion join In their divinest forms; V Our thoughts are lost in reverend awe: We love and we adore; The first archangel never saw So much of God before. VI Here the whole deity is known, Nor dares a creature guess Which of the glories brightest shone The justice or the grace. VII When sinners broke the Father's laws, The dying Son atones; Oh the dear mysteries of his cross! The triumph of his groans! VIII Now the full glories of the Lamb Adorn the heav'nly plains; Sweet cherubs learn Immanuel's name, And try their choicest strains. IX O may I bear some humble part In that immortal song! Wonder and joys shall tune my heart, And love command my tongue. The humble Enquiry. A French Sonnet imitated. 1695. Grand Dieu, tes Jugemens, &amp;c. I Grace rules below, and sits enthron'd above, How few the sparks of wrath! how slow they move, And drop and die in boundless seas of love! II But me, vile wretch! should pitying love embrace Deep in its ocean, hell itself would blaze, And flash and burn me thro' the boundless seas. III Yea, Lord, my guilt to such a vastness grown Seems to confine thy choice to wrath alone, And calls thy power to vindicate thy throne. IV Thine honour bids, ‘Avenge thy injur'd name,’ Thy slighted loves a dreadful glory claim, While my moist tears might but incense thy flame. V Should heaven grow black, almighty thunder roar, And vengeance blast me, I could plead no more, But own thy justice dying, and adore. VI Yet can those bolts of death that cleave the flood To reach a rebel, pierce this sacred shroud, Ting'd in the vital stream of my Redeemer's blood? The Penitent pardoned. I Hence from my soul, my sins, depart, Your fatal friendship now I see; Long have you dwelt too near my heart, Hence, to eternal distance flee. II Ye gave my dying Lord his wound, Yet I caress'd your viperous brood, And in my heart-strings lapp'd you round, You, the vile murderers of my God. III Black heavy thoughts, like mountains, roll O'er my poor breast, with boding fears, And crushing hard my tortured soul, Wring thro' my eyes the briny tears. IV Forgive my treasons, Prince of grace, The bloody Jews were traitors too, Yet thou hast pray'd for that curst race, ‘Father, they know not what they do.’ V Great Advocate, look down and see A wretch, whose smarting sorrows bleed; O plead the same excuse for me! For, Lord, I knew not what I did. VI Peace, my complaints; let every groan Be still, and silence wait his love; Compassions dwell amidst his throne, And thro' his inmost bowels move. VII Lo, from the everlasting skies, Gently, as morning-dews distil, The dove immortal downward flies, With peaceful olive in his bill. VIII How sweet the voice of pardon sounds! Sweet the relief to deep distress! I feel the balm that heals my wounds, And all my pow'rs adore the grace. A Hymn of Praise for Three great Salvations, viz. 1 From the Spanish Invasion, 1588. 2 From the Gun-powder Plot, Nov. 5. 3 From Popery and Slavery by King William of glorious memory, who landed Nov. 5, 1688. Composed, Nov. 5, 1695. [The First Part. I Infinite God, thy counsels stand Like mountains of eternal brass, Pillars to prop our sinking land, Or guardian rocks to break the seas. II From pole to pole thy name is known, Thee a whole heaven of angels praise; Our labouring tongues would reach thy throne With the loud triumphs of thy grace. III Part of thy church, by thy command Stands rais'd upon the British isles; ‘There,’ said the Lord, ‘to ages stand, ‘Firm as the everlasting hills.’ IV In vain the Spanish ocean roar'd; Its billows swell'd against our shore, Its billows sunk beneath thy word, With all the floating war they bore. V ‘Come,’ said the sons of bloody Rome, ‘Let us provide new arms from hell:’ And down they digg'd thro' earth's dark womb, And ransack'd all the burning cell. VI Old Satan lent them fiery stores, Infernal coal, and sulphrous flame, And all that burns, and all that roars, Outrageous fires of dreadful name. VII Beneath the senate and the throne, Engines of hellish thunder lay; There the dark seeds of fire were sown, To spring a bright but dismal day. VIII Thy love beheld the black design, Thy love that guards our island round: Strange! how it quench'd the fiery mine, And crush'd the tempest under ground. The Second Part. I Assume, my tongue, a nobler strain, Sing the new wonders of the Lord; The foes revive their pow'rs again, Again they die beneath his sword. II Dark as our thoughts our minutes roll, While tyranny possess'd the throne, And murderers of an Irish soul Ran, threat'ning death, thro' every town. III The Roman priest, and British prince, Join'd their best force, and blackest charms, And the fierce troops of neighbouring France Offer'd the service of their arms. IV ‘'Tis done,’ they cry'd, and laugh'd aloud, The courts of darkness rang with joy, Th'old serpent hiss'd, and hell grew proud, While Zion mourn'd her ruin nigh. V But lo, the great deliverer sails Commission'd from Jehovah's hand, And smiling seas, and wishing gales, Convey him to the longing land. VI The happy day, November 5, 1688. and happy year, Both in our new salvation meet: The day November 5, 1588. that quench'd the burning snare, The year that burnt the invading fleet. VII Now did thine arm, O God of hosts, Now did thine arm shine dazzling bright, The sons of might their hands had lost, And men of blood forgot to fight. VIII Brigades of angels lin'd the way, And guarded William to his throne; There, ye celestial warriors, stay, And make his palace like your own. IX Then, mighty God, the earth shall know And learn the worship of the sky, Angels and Britons join below, To raise their Hallelujahs high. X All Hallelujah, heavenly King: While distant lands thy vict'ry sing, And tongues their utmost pow'rs employ, The world's bright roof repeats the joy. The Incomprehensible. I. Far in the heav'ns my God retires, My God, the mark of my desires, And hides his lovely face; When he descends within my view, He charms my reason to pursue, But leaves it tir'd and fainting in th'unequal chase. II. Or if I reach unusual height Till near his presence brought, There floods of glory check my flight, Cramp the bold pinions of my wit, And all untune my thought; Plung'd in a sea of light I roll, Where wisdom, justice, mercy, shines; Infinite rays in crossing lines Beat thick confusion on my sight, and overwhelm my soul. III. Come to my aid, ye fellow-minds, And help me reach the throne; (What single strength, in vain designs, United force hath done; Thus worms may join, and grasp the poles, Thus atoms fill the sea) But the whole race of creature-souls Stretch'd to their last extent of thought, plunge and are lost in thee. IV. Great God, behold my reason lies Adoring; yet my love would rise On pinions not her own; Faith shall direct her humble flight, Thro' all the trackless seas of light, To Thee, th'eternal Fair, the infinite Unknown. Death and Eternity. I My thoughts, that often mount the skies, Go, search the world beneath, Where nature in all ruin lies, And owns her sovereign, death. II The tyrant, how he triumphs here! His trophies spread around! And heaps of dust and bones appear Thro' all the hollow ground. III These sculls, what ghastly figures now! How loathsome to the eyes? These are the heads we lately knew So beauteous and so wise. IV But where the souls, those deathless things, That left this dying clay? My thoughts, now strecth out all your wings, And trace eternity. V O that unfathomable sea! Those deeps without a shore! Where living waters gently play, Or fiery billows roar. VI Thus must we leave the banks of life, And try this doubtful sea; Vain are our groans, and dying strife, To gain a moment's stay. VII There we shall swim in heav'nly bliss, Or sink in flaming waves, While the pale carcase thoughtless lies, Amongst the silent graves. VIII Some hearty friend shall drop his tear On our dry bones, and say, ‘These once were strong, as mine appear, ‘And mine must be as they.’ IX Thus shall our mould'ring members teach What now our senses learn: For dust and ashes loudest preach Man's infinite concern. A Sight of Heaven in Sickness. I Oft have I sat in secret sighs, To feel my flesh decay, Then groan'd aloud with frighted eyes, To view the tott'ring clay. II But I forbid my sorrows now, Nor dares the flesh complain; Diseases bring their profit too; The joy o'ercomes the pain. III My cheerful soul now all the day Sits waiting here and sings; Looks thro' the ruins of her clay, And practises her wings. IV Faith almost changes into sight, While from afar she spies, Her fair inheritance, in light Above created skies. V Had but the prison walls been strong, And firm without a flaw, In darkness she had dwelt too long, And les of glory saw. VI But now the everlasting hills Thro' every chink appear, And something of the joy she feels, While she's a pris'ner here. VII The shines of heaven rush sweetly in At all the gaping flaws; Visions of endless bliss are seen; And native air she draws. VIII O may these walls stand tott'ring still, The breaches never close, If I must here in darkness dwell, And all this glory lose! IX Or rather let this flesh decay, The ruins wider grow, 'Till glad to see th'enlarged way, I stretch my pinions through. The universal Hallelujah. Psalm cxlviii. paraphrased. I Praise ye the Lord with joyful tongue, Ye pow'rs that guard his throne; Jesus the man shall lead the song, The God inspire the tune. II Gabriel, and all th'immortal choir That fill the realms above, Sing; for he form'd you of his fire, And feeds you with his love. III Shine to his praise, ye crystal skies, The floor of his abode, Or veil your little twinkling eyes Before a brighter God. IV Thou restless globe of golden light, Whose beams create our days, Join with the silver queen of night, To own your borrow'd rays. V Blush and refund the honours paid To your inferior names: Tell the blind world, your orbs are fed By his o'erflowing flames. VI Winds, ye shall bear his name aloud Thro' the ethereal blue, For when his chariot is a cloud, He makes his wheels of you. VII Thunder and hail, and fires and storms, The troops of his command, Appear in all your dreadful forms, And speak his awful hand. VIII Shout to the Lord, ye surging seas, In your eternal roar; Let wave to wave resound his praise, And shore reply to shore: IX While monsters sporting on the flood, In scaly silver shine, Speak terribly their Maker, God, And lash the foaming brine. X But gentler things shall tune his name, To softer notes than these, Young zephyrs breathing o'er the stream, Or whisp'ring thro' the trees. XI Wave your tall heads, ye lofty pines, To him that bid you grow, Sweet clusters, bend the fruitful vines On ev'ry thankful bough. XII Let the shrill birds his honour raise, And climb the morning-sky: While grov'ling beasts attempt his praise, In hoarser harmony. XIII Thus while the meaner creatures sing, Ye mortals, take the sound, Echo the glories of your King Thro' all the nations round. XIV Th'eternal name must fly abroad From Britain to Japan; And the whole race shall bow to God That owns the name of man. The Atheist's Mistake. I Laugh, ye profane, and swell and burst With bold impiety: Yet shall ye live for ever curs'd, And seek in vain to die. II The gasp of your expiring breath Consigns your souls to chains, By the last agonies of death Sent down to fiercer pains. III Ye stand upon a dreadful steep, And all beneath is hell; Your weighty guilt will sink you deep, Where the old serpent fell. IV When iron slumbers bind your flesh, With strange surprise you'll find Immortal vigour spring afresh, And tortures wake the mind! V Then you'll confess the frightful names Of plagues you scorn'd before, No more shall look like idle dreams, Like foolish tales no more. VI Then shall ye curse that fatal day, (With flames upon your tongues) When you exchang'd your souls away For vanity and songs. VII Behold the saints rejoice to die, For heav'n shines round their heads; And angel-guards prepar'd to fly, Attend their fainting beds. VIII Their longing spirits part, and rise To their celestial seat; Above these ruinable skies They make their last retreat. IX Hence, ye prophane, I hate your ways, I walk with pious souls; There's a wide difference in our race, And distant are our goals. The Law given at Sinai. I. Arm thee with thunder, heav'nly muse, And keep th'expecting world in awe; Oft hast thou sung in gentler mood The melting mercies of thy God; Now give thy fiercest fires a loose, And sound his dreadful law: To Israel first the words were spoke, To Israel freed from Egypt's yoke, Inhuman bondage! the hard galling load Over-press'd their feeble souls, Bent their knees to senseless bulls, And broke their ties to God. II. Now had they pass'd the Arabian bay, And march'd between the cleaving sea; The rising waves stood guardians of their wondrous way, But fell with most impeteous force On the pursuing swarms, And bury'd Egypt all in arms. Blending in wat'ry death the rider and the horse: O'er struggling Pharoah roll'd the mighty tide, And sav'd the labours of a pyramid. Apis and Ore in vain he cries, And all his horned gods beside, He swallows fate with swimming eyes, And curs'd the Hebrews as he dy'd. III. Ah! foolish Israel, to comply With Memphian idolatry! And bow to brutes, (a stupid slave) To idols impotent to save! Behold thy God, the sovereign of the sky, Has wrought salvation in the deep, Has bound thy foes in iron sleep, And rais'd thine honours high; His grace forgives thy follies past, Behold he comes in majesty, And Sinai's top proclaims his law: Prepare to meet thy God in haste! But keep an awful distance still: Let Moses round the sacred hill The circling limits draw. IV. Hark! the shrill echoes of the trumpet roar, And call the trembling armies near; Slow and unwilling they appear, Rails kept them from the mount before, Now from the rails their fear: 'Twas the same herald, and the trump the same Which shall be blown by high command, Shall bid the wheels of nature stand, And heav'n's eternal will proclaim, That ‘Time shall be no more.’ V. Thus while the labouring angel swell'd the sound, And rent the skies, and shook the ground, Up rose th'Almighty; round his sapphire seat Adoring thrones in order fell; The lesser powers at distance dwell, And cast their glories down successive at his feet: Gabriel the great prepares his way, ‘Lift up your heads, eternal doors,’ he cries; Th'eternal doors his word obey, Open and shoot celestial day Upon the lower skies. Heav'n's mighty pillars bow'd their head, As their Creator bid, And down Jehovah rode from the superior sphere, A thousand guards before, and myriads in the rear. VI. His chariot was a pitchy cloud, The wheels beset with burning gems; The winds in harness with the flames Flew o'er th'ethereal road: Down thro' his magazines he past Of hail, and ice, and fleecy snow, Swift roll'd the triumph, and as fast Did hail, and ice, in melted rivers flow. The day was mingled with the night, His feet on solid darkness trod, His radiant eyes proclaim'd the God, And scatter'd dreadful light; He breath'd, and sulphur ran, a fiery stream: He spoke, and (tho' with unknown speed he came) Chid the slow tempest, and the lagging flame. VII. Sinai receiv'd his glorious flight, With axle red, and glowing wheel, Did the winged chariot light, And rising smoke obscur'd the burning hill. Lo, it mounts in curling waves, Lo, the gloomy pride out-braves The stately pyramids of fire The pyramids to heav'n aspire, And mix with stars, but see their gloomy offspring higher. So you have seen ungrateful ivy grow Round the tall oak that six score years has stood, And proudly shoot a leaf or two Above its kind supporter's utmost bough, And glory there to stand the loftiest of the wood. VIII. Forbear, young muse, forbear; The flow'ry things that poets say, The little arts of simile Are vain and useless here; Nor shall the burning hills of old With Sinai be compar'd, Nor all that lying Greece has told, Or learned Rome has heard; Ætna shall be nam'd no more, Ætna, the torch of Sicily; Not half so high Her lightnings fly, Not half so loud her thunders roar Cross the Sicanian sea, to fright th'Italian shore. Behold the sacred hill: Its trembling spire Quakes at the terrors of the fire, While all below its verdant feet Stagger and reel under th'almighty weight: Press'd with a greater than feign'd Atlas' load Deep groan'd the mount; it never bore Infinity before, It bow'd, and shook beneath the burden of a God. IX. Fresh horror seize the camp, despair, And dying groans, torment the air, And shrieks, and swoons, and deaths were there; The bellowing thunder, and the lightning's blaze, Spread thro' the host a wild amaze; Darkness on every soul, and pale was every face: Confus'd and dismal were the cries, ‘Let Moses speak, or Israel dies:’ Moses the spreading terror feels, No more the man of God conceals His shivering and surprize: Yet, with recovering mind, commands Silence, &amp; deep attention, thro' the Hebrew bands. Hark! from the centre of the flame, All arm'd and feather'd with the same, Majestic sounds break thro' the smoky cloud: Sent from the all-creating tongue A flight of cherubs guard the words along, And bear their fiery law to the retreating crowd. X. ‘I am the Lord: 'Tis I proclaim ‘That glorious and that fearful name, ‘Thy God and King: 'Twas I, that broke ‘Thy bondage, and th'Egyptian yoke; ‘Mine is the right to speak my will, ‘And thine the duty to fulfil. ‘Adore no God beside me, to provoke mine eyes: ‘Nor worship me in shapes and forms that men devise; ‘With rev'rence use my name, nor turn my words to jest; ‘Observe my sabbath well, nor dare profane my rest; ‘Honour, and due obedience, to thy parents give; ‘Nor spill the guiltless blood, nor let the guilty live: ‘Preserve thy body chaste, and flee th'unlawful bed; ‘Nor steal thy neighbour's gold, his garment, or his bread: ‘Forbear to blast his name with falsehood, or deceit; ‘Nor let thy wishes loose upon his large estate.’ Remember your Creator, &amp;c. Ecclesiastes xii. I Children, to your Creator, God, Your early honours pay, While vanity and youthful blood Would tempt your thoughts astray. II The memory of his mighty name, Demands your first regard. Nor dare indulge a meaner flame, 'Till you have lov'd the Lord. III Be wise, and make his favour sure, Before the mournful days, When youth and mirth are known no more, And life and strength decays. IV No more the blessings of a feast Shall relish on the tongue, The heavy ear forgets the taste And pleasure of a song. V Old age, with all her dismal train, Invades your golden years With sighs and groans, and raging pain, And death, that never spares. VI What will you do when light departs, And leaves your withering eyes, Without one beam to cheer your hearts, From the superior skies? VII How will you meet God's frowning brow, Or stand before his seat, While nature's old supporters bow, Nor bear their tott'ring weight? VIII Can you expect your feeble arms Shall make a strong defence, When death, with terrible alarms, Summons the pris'ner hence? IX The silver bands of nature burst, And let the building fall; The flesh goes down to mix with dust, Its vile original. X Laden with guilt, (a heavy load) Uncleans'd and unforgiv'n, The soul returns t'an angry God, To be shut out from heav'n. Sun, Moon, and Stars, praise ye the Lord. I Fairest of all the lights above, Thou sun, whose beams adorn the spheres, And with unweary'd swiftness move, To form the circles of our years; II Praise the Creator of the skies, That dress'd thine orb in golden rays: Or may the sun forget to rise, If he forget his Maker's praise. III Thou reigning beauty of the night, Fair queen of silence, silver moon, Whose gentle beams and borrow'd light, Are softer rivals of the noon; IV Arise, and to that sov'reign pow'r Waxing and waning honours pay, Who bid thee rule the dusky hour, And half supply the absent day. V Ye twinkling stars, who gild the skies When darkness has its curtains drawn, Who keep your watch, with wakeful eyes, When business, cares, and day are gone; VI Proclaim the glories of your Lord, Dispers'd thro' all the heav'nly street, Whose boundless treasures can afford So rich a pavement for his feet. VII Thou heav'n of heav'ns, supremely bright, Fair palace of the court divine, Where, with inimitable light, The Godhead condescends to shine. VIII Praise thou thy great Inhabitant, Who scatters lovely beams of grace On ev'ry angel, ev'ry saint, Nor veils the lustre of his face. IX O God of glory, God of love, Thou art the Sun that makes our days; With all thy shining works above, Let earth and dust attempt thy praise. The Welcome Messenger. I Lord, when we see a saint of thine Lie gasping out his breath, With longing eyes, and looks divine, Smiling and pleas'd in death; II How we could e'en contend to lay Our limbs upon that bed! We ask thine envoy to convey Our spirits in his stead. III Our souls are rising on the wing, To venture in his place; For when grim death has lost his sting, He has an angel's face. IV Jesus, then purge my crimes away, 'Tis guilt creates my fears, 'Tis guilt gives death its fierce array, And all the arms it bears. V Oh! if my threat'ning sins were gone, And death had lost his sting, I could invite the angel on, And chide his lazy wing. VI Away these interposing days, And let the lovers meet; The angel has a cold embrace, But kind, and soft, and sweet. VII I'd leap at once my seventy years, I'd rush into his arms, And lose my breath, and all my cares, Amidst those heav'nly charms. VIII Joyful I'd lay this body down, And leave the lifeless clay, Without a sigh, without a groan, And stretch and soar away. Sincere Praise. I Almighty Maker, God! How wondrous is thy name! Thy glories how diffus'd abroad Thro' the creation's frame! II Nature in every dress Her humble homage pays, And finds a thousand ways t'express Thine undissembled praise. III In native white and red The rose and lily stand, And free from pride, their beauties spread, To show thy skilful hand. IV The lark mounts up the sky, With unambitious song, And bears her Maker's praise on high Upon her artless tongue. V My soul would rise and sing To her Creator too, Fain would my tongue adore my King, And pay the worship due. VI But pride, that busy sin, Spoils all that I perform; Curs'd pride, that creeps securely in, And swells a haughty worm. VII Thy glories I abate, Or praise thee with design; Some of the favours I forget, Or think the merit mine. VIII The very songs I frame, Are faithless to thy cause, And steal the honours of thy name To build their own applause. IX Create my soul anew, Else all my worship's vain; This wretched heart will ne'er be true, Until 'tis form'd again. X Descend, celestial fire, And seize me from above, Melt me in flames of pure desire, A sacrifice to love. XI Let joy and worship spend The remnant of my days, And to my God, my soul ascend, In sweet perfumes of praise. True Learning. Partly imitated from a French Sonnet of Mr. Poiret. I Happy the feet that shining truth has led With her own hand to tread the path she please, To see her native lustre round her spread, Without a veil, without a shade, All beauty, and all light, as in herself she is. II Our senses cheat us with the pressing crouds Of painted shapes they thrust upon the mind: The truth they show lies wrapp'd in sev'nfold shrouds, Our senses cast a thousand clouds On unenlighten'd souls, and leave them doubly blind. III I hate the dust that fierce disputers raise, And lose the mind in a wild maze of thought: What empty triflings, and what subtle ways To fence and guard by rule and rote! Our God will never charge us, that we knew them not. IV Touch, heav'nly Word, O touch these curious souls; Since I have heard but one soft hint from thee, From all the vain opinions of the schools (That pageantry of knowing fools) I feel my powers releas'd, and stand divinely free. V 'Twas this Almighty Word that all things made, He grasps whole nature in his single hand; All the eternal truths in him are laid, The ground of all things, and their head, The circle where they move, and centre where they stand. VI Without his aid I have no sure defence, From troops of errors that besiege me round; But he that rests his reason and his sense Fast here, and never wanders hence, Unmoveable he dwells upon unshaken ground. VII Infinite truth, the life of my desires, Come from the sky, and join thyself to me; I'm tir'd with hearing, and this reading tires; But never tir'd of telling thee, 'Tis thy fair face alone my spirit burns to see. VIII Speak to my soul, alone, no other hand Shall mark my path out with delusive art; All nature silent in his presence stand, Creatures be dumb at his command, And leave his single voice to whisper to my heart. IX Retire, my soul, within thyself retire, Away from every sense and every outward show: Now let my thoughts to loftier themes aspire, My knowledge now on wheels of fire May mount and spread above, surveying all below. X The Lord grows lavish of his heav'nly light, And pours whole floods on such a mind as this: Fled from the eyes she gains a piercing sight, She dives into the infinite, And sees unutterable things in that unknown abyss. True Wisdom. I Pronounce him blest, my muse, whom wisdom guides In her own path to her own heav'nly seat; Thro' all the storms his soul securely glides, Nor can the tempests, nor the tides, That rise and roar around, supplant his steady feet. II Earth, you may let your golden arrows fly, And seek, in vain, a passage to his breast, Spread all your painted toys to court his eye, He smiles, and sees them vainly try To lure his soul aside from her eternal rest. III Our headstrong lusts, like a young fiery horse, Start, and flee raging in a violent course; He tames and breaks them, manages and rides 'em, Checks their career, and turns and guides 'em, And bids his reason bridle their licentious force. IV Lord of himself, he rules his wildest thoughts, And boldly acts what calmly he design'd, Whilst he looks down and pities human faults; Nor can he think, nor can he find A plague like reigning passions, and a subject mind. V But oh! 'tis mighty toil to reach this height, To vanquish self is a laborious art; What manly courage to sustain the fight, To bear the noble pain, and part With those dear charming tempters rooted in the heart! VI 'Tis hard to stand when all the passions move, Hard to awake the eye that passion blinds To rend and tear out this unhappy love, That clings so close about our minds, And where th'enchanted soul so sweet a poison finds. VII Hard; but it may be done. Come heav'nly fire, Come to my breast, and with one powerful ray Melt off my lusts, my fetters: I can bear Awhile to be a tenant here, But not be chain'd and prison'd in a cage of clay. VIII Heav'n is my home and I must use my wings; Sublime above the globe my flight aspires: I have a soul was made to pity kings, And all their little glitt'ring things; I have a soul was made for infinite desires. IX Loos'd from the earth, my heart is upward flown; Farewell, my friends, and all that once was mine: Now, should you fix my feet on Cæsar's throne, Crown me, and call the world my own, The gold that binds my brows could ne'er my soul confine. X I am the Lord's, and Jesus is my love; He, the dear God, shall fill my vast desire. My flesh below; yet I can dwell above, And nearer to my Saviour move; There all my soul shall centre, all my pow'rs conspire. XI Thus I with angels live; thus half-divine I sit on high, nor mind inferior joys: Fill'd with his love, I feel that God is mine, His glory is my great design, That everlasting project all my thoughts employs. A Song to creating Wisdom. PART I. I Eternal Wisdom, thee we praise, Thee the creation sings: With thy loud name, rocks, hills, and seas, And heav'n's high palace rings. II Place me on the bright wings of day To travel with the sun; With what amaze shall I survey The wonders thou hast done? III Thy hand how wide it spread the sky! How glorious to behold? Ting'd with a blue of heav'nly dye, And starr'd with sparkling gold. IV There thou hast bid the globes of light Their endless circles run; There the pale planet rules the night, And day obeys the sun. PART II. V Downward I turn my wondering eyes On clouds and storms below, Those under-regions of the skies Thy num'rous glories show. VI The noisy winds stand ready there Thy orders to obey, With sounding wings they sweep the air, To make thy chariot way. VII There, like a trumpet, loud and strong, Thy thunder shakes our coast: While the red lightnings wave along, The banners of thine host. VIII On the thin air, without a prop, Hang fruitful show'rs around: At thy command they sink, and drop Their fatness on the ground. PART III. IX Now to the earth I bend my song, And cast my eyes abroad, Glancing the British isles along; Blest isles, confess your God. X How did his wondrous skill array Your fields in charming green; A thousand herbs his art display, A thousand flowers between! XI Tall oaks for future navies grow, Fair Albion's best defence, While corn and vines rejoice below, Those luxuries of sense. XII The bleating flocks his pasture feeds: And herds of larger size, That bellow thro' the Lindian meads, His bounteous hand supplies. PART IV. XIII We see the Thames caress the shores, He guides her silver flood: While angry Severn swells and roars, Yet hears her ruler God. XIV The rolling mountains of the deep Observe his strong command; His breath can raise the billows steep, Or sink them to the sand. XV Amidst thy wat'ry kingdoms, Lord, The finny nations play, And scaly monsters, at thy word, Rush thro' the northern sea. PART V. XVI Thy glories blaze all nature round, And strike the gazing sight, Thro' skies, and seas, and solid ground, With terror and delight. XVII Infinite strength, and equal skill, Shine thro' the worlds abroad, Our souls with vast amazement fill, And speak the builder God. XVIII But the sweet beauties of thy grace Our softer passions move; Pity divine in Jesus' face We see, adore, and love. God's absolute Dominion. I. Lord, when my thoughtful soul surveys Fire, air and earth, and stars and seas, I call them all thy slaves; Commission'd by my Father's will, Poisons shall cure, or balms shall kill; Vernal suns, or zephyr's breath, May burn or blast the plants to death That sharp December saves; What can winds or planets boast But a precarious pow'r? The sun is all in darkness lost, Frost shall be fire, and fire be frost, When he appoints the hour. II. Lo, the Norwegians near the polar sky Chafe their frozen limbs with snow; Their frozen limbs awake and glow, The vital flame touch'd with a strange supply Rekindles, for the God of life is nigh; He bids the vital flood in wonted circles flow. Cold steel expos'd to northern air, Drinks the meridian fury of the midnight Bear, And burns th'unwary stranger there. III. Enquire, my soul, of ancient fame, Look back to thousand years, and see Th'Assyrian prince transform'd a brute, For boasting to be absolute: Once to his court the God of Israel came, A King more absolute than he. I see the furnace blaze with rage Sevenfold: I see amidst the flame Three Hebrews of immortal name; They move, they walk across the burning stage Unhurt, and fearless, while the tyrant stood A statue; fear congeal'd his blood: Nor did the raging element dare Attempt their garments, or their hair; It knew the Lord of nature there. Nature, compell'd by a superior cause, Now breaks her own eternal laws, Now seems to break them, and obeys Her sov'reign King in different ways. Father, how bright thy glories shine! How broad thy kingdom, how divine! Nature, and miracle, and fate, and chance are thine. IV. Hence from my heart, ye idols, flee, Ye sounding names of vanity! No more my lips shall sacrifice To chance and nature, tales and lies: Creatures without a God can yield me no supplies. What is the sun, or what the shade, Or frosts, or flames, to kill or save? His favour is my life, his lips pronounce me dead: And as his awful dictates bid, Earth is my mother, or my grave. Condescending Grace. In Imitation of the 114th Psalm. I When the Eternal bows the skies, To visit earthly things, With scorn divine he turns his eyes From towers of haughty kings; II Rides on a cloud disdainful by A sultan, or a czar, Laughs at the worms that rise so high, Or frowns 'm from afar; III He bids his awful chariot roll Far downward from the skies, To visit ev'ry humble soul, With pleasure in his eyes. IV Why should the Lord that reigns above Disdain so lofty kings? Say, Lord, and why such looks of love Upon such worthless things? V Mortals, be dumb; what creature dares Dispute his awful will; Ask no account of his affairs, But tremble, and be still. VI Just like his nature is his grace, All sov'reign, and all free; Great God, how searchless are thy ways! How deep thy judgments be! The Infinite. I Some seraph, lend your heav'nly tongue, Or harp of golden string, That I may raise a lofty song To our eternal King. II Thy names, how infinite they be! Great Everlasting One! Boundless thy might and majesty, And unconfin'd thy throne. III Thy glories shine of wondrous size, And wondrous large thy grace; Immortal day breaks from thine eyes, And Gabriel veils his face. IV Thine essence is a vast abyss, Which angels cannot sound, An ocean of infinities Where all our thoughts are drown'd. V The mysteries of creation lie Beneath enlighten'd minds, Thoughts can ascend above the sky, And fly before the winds. VI Reason may grasp the massy hills And stretch from pole to pole, But half thy name our spirit fills, And overloads our soul. VII In vain our haughty reason swells, For nothing's found in Thee But boundless inconceivables, And vast eternity. Confession and Pardon. I Alas, my aching heart! Here the keen torment lies; It racks my waking hours with smart, And frights my slumbering eyes. II Guilt will be hid no more, My griefs take vent apace, The crimes that blot my conscience o'er Flush crimson in my face. III My sorrows, like a flood, Impatient of restraint, Into thy bosom, O my God, Pour out a long complaint. IV This impious heart of mine Could once defy the Lord, Could rush with violence on to sin In presence of thy sword. V How often have I stood A rebel to the skies, The calls, the tenders of a God, And mercy's loudest cries! VI He offers all his grace, And all his heav'n to me; Offers! but 'tis to senseless brass, That cannot feel nor see. VII Jesus the Saviour stands To court me from above, And looks and spreads his wounded hands, And shews the prints of love. VIII But I, a stupid fool, How long have I withstood The blessings purchas'd with his soul, And paid for all in blood? IX The heav'nly Dove came down And tender'd me his wings To mount me upward to a crown, And bright immortal things. X Lord, I'm asham'd to say That I refus'd thy Dove, And sent thy Spirit griev'd away, To his own realms of love. XI Not all thine heav'nly charms, Nor terrors of thy hand, Could force me to lay down my arms, And bow to thy command. XII Lord, 'tis against thy face My sins like arrows rise, And yet, and yet, O matchless grace! Thy thunder silent lies. XIII O shall I never feel The meltings of thy love? Am I of such hell-harden'd steel That mercy cannot move? XIV Now for one powerful glance, Dear Saviour, from thy face! This rebel heart no more withstands, But sinks beneath thy grace. XV O'ercome by dying love I fall, Here at thy cross I lie; And throw my flesh, my soul, my all, And weep, and love, and die. XVI ‘Rise,’ says the Prince of mercy, ‘rise, ‘With joy and pity in his eyes: ‘Rise, and behold my wounded veins, ‘Here flows the blood to wash thy stains. XVII ‘See my great Father reconcil'd:’ He said. And lo, the Father smil'd; The joyful cherubs clapp'd their wings, And sounded grace on all their strings. Young Men and Maidens, old Men and Babes, praise ye the Lord, Psalm cxlviii. 12. I. Sons of Adam, bold and young, In the wild mazes of whose veins A flood of fiery vigour reigns, And weilds your active limbs, with hardy sinews strung; Fall prostrate at th'eternal throne Whence your precarious pow'rs depend; Nor swell as if your lives were all your own, But choose your Maker for your friend; His favour is your life, his arm is your support, His hand can stretch your days, or cut your minutes short. II. Virgins, who roll your artful eyes, And shoot delicious danger thence: Swift the lovely lightning flies, And melts our reason down to sense; Boast not of those with'ring charms That must yield their youthful grace To age and wrinkles, earth and worms; But love the Author of your smiling face; That heav'nly Bridegroom claims your blooming hours; O make it your perpetual care To please that everlasting Fair; His beauties are the sun, and but the shade is yours. III. Infants, whose different destinies Are wove with threads of different size; But from the same spring-tide of tears, Commence your hopes, and joys, and fears, (A tedious train!) and date your following years: Break your first silence in his praise Who wrought your wondrous frame: With sounds of tenderest accent raise Young honours to his name; And consecrate your early days To know the pow'r supreme: IV. Ye heads of venerable age Just marching off the mortal stage, Fathers, whose vital threads are spun As long as e'er the glass of life would run, Adore the hand that led your way Thro' flow'ry fields a fair long summer's day; Gasp out your soul in praises to the sovereign pow'r That set your west so distant from your dawning hour. Flying Fowl, and creeping Things, praise ye the Lord. Psalm cxlviii. 10. I. Sweet flocks, whose soft enamel'd wing Swift and gently cleaves the sky; Whose charming notes address the spring With an artless harmony. Lovely minstrels of the field, Who in leafy shadows sit, And your wondrous structures build, Awake your tuneful voices with the dawning light; To nature's God your first devotions pay, E'er you salute the rising day, 'Tis he calls up the sun, and gives him every ray. II. Serpents, who o'er the meadows slide, And wear upon your shining back Num'rous ranks of gaudy pride, Which thousand mingling colours make: Let the fierce glances of your eyes Rebate their baleful fire; In harmless play twist and unfold The volumes of your scaly gold: That rich embroidery of your gay attire, Proclaims your Maker kind and wise. III. Insects and mites, of mean degree, That swarm in myriads o'er the land, Moulded by wisdom's artful hand, And curl'd and painted with a various die; In your innumerable forms Praise him that wears th'ethereal crown, And bends his lofty counsels down To despicable worms. The Comparison and Complaint. I Infinite power, eternal Lord, How sov'reign is thy hand! All nature rose t'obey thy word, And moves at thy command. II With steady course thy shining sun Keeps his appointed way, And all the hours obedient run The circle of the day. III But ah! how wide my spirit flies, And wanders from her God! My soul forgets the heavenly prize, And treads the downward road. IV The raging fire, and stormy sea, Perform thine awful will; And ev'ry beast and ev'ry tree, Thy great designs fulfil: V While my wild passions rage within, Nor thy commands obey; And flesh and sense, inslav'd to sin, Draw my best thoughts away. VI Shall creatures of a meaner frame Pay all their dues to thee; Creatures, that never knew thy name, That never lov'd like me? VII Great God, create my soul anew, Conform my heart to thine, Melt down my will, and let it flow, And take the mould divine. VIII Seize my whole frame into thy hand: Here all my pow'rs I bring; Manage the wheels by thy command, And govern ev'ry spring. IX Then shall my feet no more depart, Nor wandering senses rove; Devotion shall be all my heart, And all my passions love. X Then not the sun shall more than I His Maker's law perform, Nor travel swifter thro' the sky, Nor with a zeal so warm. God Supreme, and Self-sufficient. I What is our God, or what his name Nor men can learn, nor angels teach; He dwells conceal'd in radiant flame, Where neither eyes nor thoughts can reach. II The spacious worlds of heavenly light, Compar'd with him, how short they fall? They are too dark, and he too bright. Nothing are they, and God is all. III He spoke the wondrous word, and lo Creation rose at his command; Whirlwinds and seas their limits know, Bound in the hollow of his hand. IV There rests the earth, there roll the spheres, There nature leans, and feels her prop: But his own self-sufficience bears The weight of his own glories up. V The tide of creatures ebbs and flows, Measuring their changes by the moon: No ebb his sea of glory knows; His age is one eternal noon. VI Then fly, my song, an endless round, The lofty tune let Michael raise; All nature dwell upon the sound, But we can ne'er fulfil the praise. Jesus the only Saviour. I Adam, our father and our head, Transgrest; and justice doom'd us dead: The fiery law speaks all despair, There's no reprieve, nor pardon there. II Call a bright council in the skies; ‘Seraphs the mighty and the wise, ‘Say, what expedient can you give, ‘That sin be damn'd, and sinners live? III ‘Speak, are you strong to bear the load, ‘The weighty vengeance of a God? ‘Which of you loves our wretched race, ‘Or dares to venture in our place?’ IV In vain we ask; for all around Stands silence thro' the heavenly ground: There's not a glorious mind above Has half the strength, or half the love. V But, O unutterable grace! Th'eternal Son takes Adam's place; Down to our world the Saviour flies, Stretches his naked arms, and dies. VI Justice was pleas'd to bruise the God, And pay its wrongs with heav'nly blood; What unknown racks and pangs he bore! Then rose: The law could ask no more. VII Amazing work! look down, ye skies, Wonder and gaze with all your eyes; Ye heav'nly thrones, stoop from above, And bow to this mysterious love. VIII See, how they bend! See, how they look! Long they had read th'eternal book, And studied dark degrees in vain, The cross and Calvary makes them plain. IX Now they are struck with deep amaze, Each with his wings conceals his face; Nor clap their sounding plumes, and cry, ‘The wisdom of a Deity!’ X Low they adore th'incarnate Son, And sing the glories he hath won; Sing how he broke our iron chains, How deep he sunk, how high he reigns. XI Triumph and reign, victorious Lord, By all thy flaming hosts ador'd; And say, dear conqueror, say, how long Ere we shall rise to join their song. XII Lo, from afar the promis'd day Shines with a well-distinguish'd ray; But my wing'd passion hardly bears These lengths of slow delaying years. XIII Send down a chariot from above, With fiery wheels, and pav'd with love; Raise me beyond th'ethereal blue, To sing and love as angels do. Looking upward. I The heavens invite mine eye, The stars salute me round; Father, I blush, I mourn to lie Thus grov'ling on the ground. II My warmer spirits move, And make attempts to fly; I wish aloud for wings of love To raise me swift and high. III Beyond those crystal vaults, And all their sparkling balls; They're but the porches to thy courts, And paintings on thy walls. IV Vain world, farewell to you; Heav'n is my native air: I bid my friends a short adieu, Impatient to be there. V I feel my powers releast From their old fleshy clod; Fair Guardian, bear me up in haste And set me near my God. Christ dying, rising and reigning. I He dies! the heav'nly Lover dies! The tidings strike a doleful sound On my poor heart-strings. Deep he lies In the cold caverns of the ground. II Come, saints, and drop a tear or two, On the dear bosom of your God, He shed a thousand drops for you, A thousand drops of richer blood. III Here's love and grief beyond degree, The Lord of glory dies for men! But lo, what sudden joys I see! Jesus the dead revives again. IV The rising God forsakes the tomb, Up to his Father's court he flies; Cherubic legions guard him home, And shout him welcome to the skies. V Break off your tears, ye saints, and tell How high our great Deliverer reigns; Sing how he spoil'd the hosts of hell, And led the monster death in chains. VI Say, ‘Live for ever, wondrous King! ‘Born to redeem, and strong to save!’ Then ask the monster, ‘Where's his sting? ‘And where's thy victory, boasting grave?’ The God of Thunder. I O the immense, the amazing height, The boundless grandeur of our God, Who treads the worlds beneath his feet, And sways the nations with his nod! II He speaks; and lo, all nature shakes, Heav'n's everlasting pillars bow; He rends the clouds with hideous cracks, And shoots his fiery arrows through. III Well, let the nations start and fly At the blue lightning's horrid glare, Atheists and emperors shrink and die, When flame and noise torment the air. IV Let noise and flame confound the skies, And drown the spacious realms below, Yet will we sing the thunderer's praise, And send our loud hosannas through. V Celestial King, thy blazing power Kindles our hearts to flaming joys, We shout to hear thy thunders roar, And echo to our Father's voice. VI Thus shall the God our Saviour come, And lightnings round his chariot play; Ye lightnings, fly to make him room; Ye glorious storms, prepare his way. The Day of Judgment, AN ODE, Attempted in English Sapphic. I When the fierce north wind with his airy forces Rears up the Baltic to a foaming fury; And the red lightning, with a storm of hail comes Rushing amain down, II How the poor sailors stand amaz'd and tremble! While the hoarse thunder, like a bloody trumpet, Roars a loud onset to the gaping waters Quick to devour them. III Such shall the noise be, and the wild disorder, (If things eternal may be like these earthly) Such the dire terror when the great Archangel Shakes the creation; IV Tears the strong pillars of the vault of heaven, Breaks up old marble, the repose of princes; See the graves open, and the bones arising, Flames all around 'em! V Hark, the shrill outcries of the guilty wretches! Lively bright horror, and amazing anguish, Stare thro' their eye-lids, while the living worm lies Gnawing within them. VI Thoughts, like old vultures, prey upon their heart-strings, And the smart twinges, when the eye beholds the Lofty Judge frowning, and a flood of vengeance Rolling afore him. VII Hopeless immortals! how they scream and shiver While devils push them to the pit wide-yawning Hideous and gloomy to receive them headlong Down to the centre. VIII Stop here, my fancy: (All away, ye horrid Doleful ideas,) come, arise to Jesus, How he sits God-like! and the saints around him Thron'd, yet adoring! IX O may I sit there when he comes triumphant, Dooming the nations! then ascend to glory, While our hosannas all along the passage Shout the Redeemer. The Song of Angels above. I Earth has detain'd me prisoner long, And I'm grown weary now: My heart, my hand, my ear, my tongue, There's nothing here for you. II Tir'd in my thoughts I stretch me down, And upward glance mine eyes. Upward, my Father, to thy throne, And to my native skies. III There the dear Man, my Saviour sits, The God, how bright he shines! And scatters infinite delights On all the happy minds. IV Seraphs with elevated strains Circle the throne around, And move and charm the starry plains With an immoral sound. V Jesus the Lord their harps employs, Jesus my love they sing, Jesus the name of both our joys Sounds sweet from ev'ry string. VI Hark, how beyond the narrow bounds Of time and space they run, And speak in most majestic sounds, The Godhead of the Son. VII How on the Father's breast he lay, The darling of his soul. Infinite years before the day Or heavens began to roll. VIII And now they sink the lofty tone, And gentler notes they play, And bring th'eternal Godhead down To dwell in humble clay. IX O sacred beauties of the Man! (The God resides within) His flesh all pure, without a stain, His soul without a sin. X Then, how he look'd, and how he smil'd, What wondrous things he said! Sweet cherubs, stay, dwell here a while, And tell what Jesus did. XI At his command the blind awake, And feel the gladsome rays; He bids the dumb attempt to speak, They try their tongues in praise. XII He shed a thousand blessings round Where'er he turn'd his eye; He spoke, and at the sov'reign sound The hellish legions fly. XIII Thus while with unambitious strife Th'ethereal minstrels rove Thro' all the labours of his life, And wonders of his love. XIV In the full choir a broken string Groans with a strange surprize; The rest in silence mourn their King, That bleeds, and loves, and dies. XV Seraph and saint, with drooping wings, Cease their harmonious breath; No blooming trees, nor bubbling springs, While Jesus sleeps in death. XVI Then all at once to living strains They summon every chord, Break up the tomb, and burst his chains, And show their rising Lord. XVII Around the flaming army throngs To guard him to the skies, With loud hosannas on their tongues, And triumph in their eyes. XVIII In awful state the conqu'ring God Ascends his shining throne, While tuneful angels sound abroad The vict'ries he has won. XIX Now let me rise, and join their song, And be an angel too; My heart, my hand, my ear, my tongue, Here's joyful work for you. XX I would begin the music here, And so my soul should rise: Oh for some heavenly notes to bear My spirit to the skies! XXI There, ye that love my Saviour, sit, There I would fain have place, Amongst your thrones, or at your feet, So I might see his face. XXII I am confin'd to earth no more, But mount in haste above, To bless the God that I adore, And sing the Man I love. Fire, Air, Earth, and Sea, praise ye the Lord. I. Earth, thou great footstool of our God Who reigns on high; thou fruitful source Of all our raiment, life and food; Our house, our parent and our nurse; Mighty stage of mortal scenes, Drest with strong and gay machines, Hung with golden lamps around: (And flow'ry carpets spread the ground) Thou bulky globe, prodigious mass, That hangs unpillar'd in an empty space! While thy unweildy weight rests on the feeble air, Bless that Almighty Word that fix'd and holds thee there. II. Fire, thou swift herald of his face, Whose glorious rage, at his command, Levels a palace with the sand, Blending the lofty spires in ruin with the base: Ye heav'nly flames, that singe the air, Artillery of a jealous God, Bright arrows that his sounding quivers bear To scatter deaths abroad; Lightnings, adore the sov'reign arm that flings His vengeance, and your fires, upon the heads of kings. III. Thou vital element, the air, Whose boundless magazines of breath Our fainting flame of life repair, And save the bubble man from the cold arms of death: And ye, whose vital moisture yields Life's purple stream a fresh supply; Sweet waters, wand'ring thro' the flow'ry fields, Or dropping from the sky; Confess the Pow'r whose all-sufficient name Nor needs your aid to build, or to support our frame. IV. Now the rude air, with noisy force, Beats up and swells the angry sea, They join to make our lives a prey, And sweep the sailor's hopes away. Vain hopes, to reach their kindred on the shores! Lo, the wild seas and surging waves Gape hideous in a thousand graves: Be still, ye floods, and know your bounds of sand, Ye storms, adore your Master's hand; The winds are in his fist, the waves at his command. V. From the eternal emptiness His fruitful word by secret springs Drew the whole harmony of things That form this noble universe: Old nothing knew his pow'rful hand, Scarce had he spoke his full command, Fire, air, and earth, and sea, heard the creating call, And leap'd from empty nothing to this beauteous all; And still they dance, and still obey The orders they receiv'd the great creation-day. The Farewell. I Dead be my heart to all below, To mortal joys and mortal cares; To sensual bliss that charms us so Be dark, my eyes, and deaf my ears. II Here I renounce my carnate taste Of the fair fruit that sinners prize: Their paradise shall never waste One thought of mine, but to despise. III All earthly joys are overweigh'd With mountains of vexatious care; And where's the sweet that is not laid A bait to some destructive snare? IV Be gone for ever, mortal things! Thou mighty mole-hill, earth, farewell! Angels aspire on lofty wings, And leave the globe for ants to dwell. V Come heav'n, and fill my vast desires, My soul pursues the sov'reign good: She was all made of heavenly fires, Nor can she live on meaner food. God only known to Himself. I Stand and adore! how glorious he That dwells in bright eternity! We gaze, and we confound our sight Plung'd in th'abyss of dazzling light. II Thus sacred One, Almighty Three, Great Everlasting Mystery, What lofty numbers shall we frame Equal to thy tremendous name? III Seraphs, the nearest to the throne, Begin, and speak the Great Unknown: Attempt the song, wind up your strings, To notes untry'd, and boundless things. IV You, whose capacious pow'rs survey Largely beyond our eyes of clay: Yet what a narrow portion too Is seen, or known, or thought by you? V How flat your highest praises fall Below the immense Original! Weak creatures we, that strive in vain To reach an uncreated strain! VI Great God, forgive our feeble lays, Sound out thine own eternal praise; A song so vast, a theme so high, Calls for the voice that tun'd the sky. Pardon and Sanctification. I My crimes awake; and hideous fear Distracts my restless mind, Guilt meets my eyes with horrid glare, And hell pursues behind. II Almighty vengeance frowns on high, And flames array the throne; While thunder murmurs round the sky, Impatient to be gone. III Where shall I hide this noxious head; Can rocks or mountains save? Or shall I wrap me in the shade Of midnight and the grave? IV Is there no shelter from the eye Of a revenging God? Jesus, to thy dear wounds I fly, Bedew me with thy blood. V Those guardian drops my soul secure, And wash away my sin; Eternal justice frowns no more, And conscience smiles within. VI I bless that wondrous purple stream That whitens every stain; Yet is my soul but half redeem'd, If sin the tyrant reign. VII Lord, blast his empire with thy breath, That cursed throne must fall; Ye flatt'ring plagues, that work my death, Fly, for I hate you all. Sovereignty and Grace. I The Lord! how fearful is his name? How wide is his command? Nature, with all her moving frame, Rests on his mighty hand. II Immortal glory forms his throne, And light his awful robe; Whilst with a smile, or with a frown, He manages the globe. III A word of his almighty breath Can swell or sink the seas; Build the vast empires of the earth, Or break them as he please. IV Adoring angels round him fall In all their shining forms, His sov'reign eye looks thro' them all, And pities mortal worms. V His bowels, to our worthless race, In sweet compassion move; He clothes his looks with softest grace, And takes his title, love. VI Now let the Lord for ever reign, And sway us as he will, Sick, or in health, in ease, or pain, We are his favourites still. VII No more shall peevish passion rise, The tongue no more complain; 'Tis sov'reign love that lends our joys, And love resumes again. The Law and Gospel. I ‘Curst be the man, for ever curst, ‘That doth one wilful sin commit; ‘Death and damnation for the first, ‘Without relief and infinite.’ II Thus Sinai roars; and round the earth Thunder, and fire, and vengeance flings; But Jesus, thy dear gasping breath, And Calvary, say gentler things. III ‘Pardon, and grace, and boundless love, ‘Streaming along a Saviour's blood, ‘And life, and joys, and crowns above, ‘Dear purchas'd by a bleeding God.’ IV Hark, how he prays, (the charming sound Dwells on his dying lips) Forgive; And every groan, and gaping wound, Cries, ‘Father, let the rebels live.’ V Go, you that rest upon the law, And toil, and seek salvation there, Look to the flames that Moses saw, And shrink, and tremble, and despair. VI But I'll retire beneath the cross, Saviour, at thy dear feet I lie; And the keen sword that justice draws, Flaming and red, shall pass me by. Seeking a divine Calm in a restless World. O Mens, quæ stabili fata regis vice, &amp;c. Casimire, book iii. od 28. I Eternal mind, who rul'st the fates Of dying realms, and rising states, With one unchang'd decree, While we admire thy vast affairs, Say, can our little trifling cares, Afford a smile to thee? II Thou scatterest honours, crowns and gold; We fly to seize, and fight to hold The bubbles and the ore: So emmets struggle for a grain; So boys their petty wars maintain For shells upon the shore. III Here a vain man his sceptre breaks, The next a broken sceptre takes, And warriors win and lose; This rolling world will never stand, Plunder'd and snatch'd from hand to hand, As power decays or grows. IV Earth's but an atom: Greedy swords Carve it amongst a thousand lords, And yet they can't agree: Let greedy swords still fight and slay, I can be poor; but, Lord, I pray To sit and smile with thee. Happy Frailty. I ‘How meanly dwells th'immortal mind! ‘How vile these bodies are! ‘Why was a clod of earth design'd ‘T'inclose a heav'nly star? II ‘Weak cottage where our souls reside! ‘This flesh a tott'ring wall; ‘With frightful breaches gaping wide ‘The building bends to fall. III ‘All round it storms of trouble blow, ‘And waves of sorrow roll; ‘Cold waves and winter's storms beat through, ‘And pain the tenant soul. IV ‘Alas! how frail our state!’ said I; And thus went mourning on, Till sudden from the cleaving sky A gleam of glory shone. V My soul all felt the glory come, And breath'd her native air; Then she remember'd heav'n her home, And she a pris'ner here. VI Straight she began to change her key, And joyful in her pains, She sung the frailty of her clay In pleasurable strains. VII ‘How weak the pris'n is where I dwell! ‘Flesh but a tott'ring wall ‘The breaches cheerfully foretel, ‘The house must shortly fall. VIII ‘No more, my friends, shall I complain, ‘Tho' all my heart-strings ache; ‘Welcome disease, and ev'ry pain, ‘That makes the cottage shake. IX ‘Now let the tempest blow all round, ‘Now swell the surges high, ‘And beat this house of bondage down, ‘To let the stranger fly. X ‘I have a mansion built above ‘By the eternal hand; ‘And should the earth's old basis move, ‘My heav'nly house must stand. XI ‘Yes, for 'tis there my Saviour reigns, ‘(I long to see the God) ‘And his immortal strength sustains ‘The courts that cost him blood.’ XII Hark, from on high my Saviour calls: ‘I come, my Lord, my love:’ Devotion breaks the prison walls, And speeds my last remove. Launching into Eternity. It was a brave attempt! adventurous he, Who in the first ship broke the unknown sea, And leaving his dear native shores behind, Trusted his life to the licentious wind. I see the surging brine: the tempest raves: He on a pine-plank rides across the waves Exulting on the edge of thousand gaping graves: He steers the winged boat, and shifts the sails, Conquers the flood, and manages the gales. Such is the soul that leaves this mortal land Fearless when the great Master gives command. Death is the storm: She smiles to hear it roar, And bids the tempest waft her from the shore: Then with a skilful helm she sweeps the seas, And manages the raging storm with ease; (Her faith can govern death) she spreads her wings Wide to the wind, and as she sails she sings, And loses by degrees, the sight of mortal things. As the shores lessen, so her joys arise, The waves roll gentler, and the tempest dies: Now vast eternity fills all her sight! She floats on the broad deep with infinite delight, The seas for ever calm, the skies for ever bright. A Prospect of the Resurrection. I How long shall death the tyrant reign And triumph o'er the just, While the rich blood of martyrs slain Lies mingled with the dust? II When shall the tedious night be gone? When will our Lord appear? Our fond desires would pray him down, Our love embrace him here. III Let faith arise and climb the hills, And from afar descry How distant are his chariot-wheels, And tell how fast they fly. IV Lo, I behold the scatt'ring shades, The dawn of heav'n appears, The sweet immortal morning spreads Its blushes round the spheres. V I see the Lord of glory come, And flaming guards around: The skies divide to make him room, The trumpet shakes the ground. VI I hear the voice, ‘Ye dead arise,’ And lo, the graves obey, And waking saints with joyful eyes Salute th'expected day. VII They leave the dust, and on the wing Rise to the middle air, In shining garments meet their King, And low adore him there. VIII O may my humble spirit stand Amongst them cloth'd in white! The meanest place at his right-hand Is infinite delight. IX How will our joy and wonder rise, When our returning King Shall bear us homeward thro' the skies On love's triumphant wing! Breathing toward the heavenly Country. Casimire, book i. od. 19. Imitated. Urit me Patriæ Decor, &amp;c. The beauty of my native land Immortal love inspires; I burn, I burn with strong desires, And sigh, and wait the high command. There glides the moon her shining way, And shoots my heart thro' with a silver ray, Upward my heart aspires: A thousand lamps of golden light Hung high, in vaulted azure, charm my sight, And wink and beckon with their amorous fires, O ye fair glories of my heav'nly home, Bright centinels who guard my Father's court, Where all the happy minds resort, When will my Father's chariot come? Must ye for ever walk the ethereal round? For ever see the mourner lie An exile of the sky, A pris'ner of the ground? Descend some shining servants from on high, Build me a hasty tomb; A grassy turf will raise my head; The neighbouring lilies dress my bed; And shed a cheap perfume. Here I put off the chains of death, My soul too long has worn: Friends, I forbid one groaning breath, Or tear to wet my urn; Raphael, behold me all undrest, Here gently lay this flesh to rest; Then mount, and lead the path unknown, Swift I pursue thee, flaming guide, on pinions of my own. Casimiri Epigramma 100. Englished. On Saint Ardalio, who from a Stage-player became a Christian, and suffered Martyrdom. I Ardalio jeers, and in his comic strains The mysteries of our bleeding God profanes, While his loud laughter shakes the painted scenes. II Heaven heard, and straight around the smoking throne The kindling lightning in thick flashes shone, And vengeful thunder murmur'd to be gone. III Mercy stood near, and with a smiling brow Calm'd the loud thunder; ‘There's no need of you; ‘Grace shall descend, and the weak man subdue.’ IV Grace leaves the skies, and he the stage forsakes, He bows his head down to the martyring axe, And as he bows, this gentle farewell speaks; V ‘So goes the comedy of life away; ‘Vain earth, adieu; heaven will applaud to-day; ‘Strike, courteous tyrant, and conclude the play. When the Protestant Church at Montpelier was demolished by the French King's Order, the Protestants laid the Stones up in their Burying-place, wherein a Jesuit made a Latin Epigram. Englished thus: A hug'not church, once at Montpelier built, Stood and proclaim'd their madness and their guilt; Too long it stood beneath heav'n's angry frown, Worthy when rising to be thunder'd down. Lewis, at last, th'avenger of the skies, Commands, and level with the ground it lies: The stones dispers'd, their wretched offspring come, Gather, and heap them on their father's tomb. Thus the curs'd house falls on the builder's head: And tho' beneath the ground their bones are laid, Yet the just vengeance still pursues the guilty dead. The Answer, by a French Protestant. Englished thus: A Christian church once at Montpelier stood, And nobly spoke the builder's zeal for God. It stood the envy of the fierce dragoon, But not deserv'd to be destroy'd so soon: Yet Lewis, the wild tyrant of the age, Tears down the walls, a victim to his rage. Young faithful hands pile up the sacred stones (Dear monument!) o'er their dead father's bones; The stones shall move when the dead fathers rise, Start up before the pale destroyer's eyes, And testify his madness to th'avenging skies. Two happy Rivals, Devotion and the Muse. I. Wild as the lightning, various as the moon, Roves my Pindaric song: Here she glows like burning noon In fiercest flames, and here she plays Gentle as star-beams on the midnight seas: Now in a smiling angel's form, Anon she rides upon the storm, Loud as the noisy thunder, as a deluge strong, Are my thoughts and wishes free, And know no number nor degree? Such is the muse: Lo, she disdains The links and chains, Measures and rules of vulgar strains, And o'er the laws of harmony a sovereign queen she reigns. II. If she roves By streams or groves Tuning her pleasures or her pains, My passion keeps her still in sight, My passion holds an equal flight Thro' love's, or nature's wide campaigns. If with bold attempt she sings Of the biggest mortal things, Tottering thrones and nations slain; Or breaks the fleets of warring kings, While thunders roar From shore to shore, My soul sits fast upon her wings, And sweeps the crimson surge, or scours the purple plain; Still I attend her as she flies, Round the broad globe, and all beneath the skies. III. But when from the meridian star Long streaks of glory shine, And heaven invites her from afar, She takes the hint, she knows the sign, The muse ascends her heavenly car, And climbs the steepy path, and means the throne divine. Then she leaves my fluttering mind Clogg'd with clay, and unrefin'd, Lengths of distance far behind: Virtue lags with heavy wheel; Faith has wings, but cannot rise, Cannot rise,—Swift and high As the winged numbers fly, And faint devotion panting lies Half way th'ethereal hill. IV. O why is piety so weak, And yet the muse so strong? When shall these hateful fetters break That have confin'd me long? Inward a glowing heat I feel, A spark of heav'nly day; But earthly vapours damp my zeal, And heavy flesh drags me the downward way. Faint are the efforts of my will, And mortal passion charms my soul astray. Shine, thou sweet hour of dear release, Shine from the sky, And call me high To mingle with the choirs of glory and of bliss. Devotion there begins the flight, Awakes the song, and guides the way; There love and zeal divine and bright Trace out new regions in the world of light, And scarce the boldest muse can follow or obey. V. I'm in a dream, and fancy reigns, She spreads her gay delusive scenes; Or is the vision true? Behold Religion on her throne, In awful state descending down, And her dominions vast and bright within my spacious view. She smiles, and with a courteous hand She beckens me away; I feel mine airy powers loose from the cumbrous clay, And with a joyful haste obey Religion's high command. What lengths and heights and depths unknown! Broad fields with blooming glory sown, And seas, and skies, and stars her own, In an unmeasur'd sphere! What heavens of joy, and light serene, Which nor the rolling sun has seen, Where nor the roving muse has been That greater traveller! VI. A long farewell to all below, Farewell to all that sense can show, To golden scenes, and flow'ry fields, To all the worlds that fancy builds, And all that poets know. Now the swift transports of the mind Leave the fluttering muse behind, A thousand loose Pindaric plumes fly scatt'ring down the wind. Amongst the clouds I lose my breath, The rapture grows too strong: The feeble pow'rs that nature gave Faint, and drop downward to the grave; Receive their fall, thou treasurer of death; I will no more demand my tongue, Till the gross organ well refin'd Can trace the boundless flights of an unfetter'd mind, And raise an equal song. The following Poems of this Book are peculiarly dedicated to Divine Love. Different ages have their different airs and fashions of writing. It was much more the fashion of the age, when these poems were written, to treat of divine subjects in the style of Solomon's Song than it is at this day, which will afford some apology for the writer, in his youngest years. The Hazard of loving the Creatures. I Where'er my flatt'ring passions rove I find a lurking snare; 'Tis dangerous to let loose our love Beneath th'eternal fair. II Souls whom the tie of friendship binds, And partners of our blood, Seize a large portion of our minds, And leave the less for God. III Nature has soft but pow'rful bands, And reason she controls; While children with their little hands Hang closest to our souls. IV Thoughtless they act th'old serpent's part What tempting things they be! Lord, how they twine about our heart, And draw it off from thee! V Our hasty wills rush blindly on Where rising passion rolls, And thus we make our fetters strong To bind our slavish souls. VI Dear Sov'reign, break these fetters off, And set our spirits free; God in himself is bliss enough, For we have all in thee. Desiring to Love Christ. I Come, let me love: Or is thy mind Harden'd to stone, or froze to ice? I see the blessed Fair One bend And stoop t'embrace me from the skies! II O! 'tis a thought would melt a rock, And make a heart of iron move, That those sweet lips, that heav'nly look, Should seek and wish a mortal love! III I was a traitor doom'd to fire, Bound to sustain eternal pains; He flew on wings of strong desire, Assum'd my guilt, and took my chains. IV Infinite grace! Almighty charms! Stand in amaze, ye whirling skies, Jesus the God, with naked arms; Hangs on a cross of love, and dies. V Did pity ever stoop so low, Dress'd in divinity and blood? Was ever rebel courted so In groans of an expiring God? VI Again he lives; and spreads his hands, Hands that were nail'd to tort'ring smart; ‘By these dear wounds,’ says he; and stands And prays to clasp me to his heart. VII Sure I must love; or are my ears Still deaf, nor will my passion move? Then let me melt this heart to tears; This heart shall yield to death or love. The Heart given away. I If there are passions in my soul, (And passions sure they be) Now they are all at thy control, My Jesus, all for thee. II If love, that pleasing power, can rest In hearts so hard as mine, Come, gentle Saviour, to my breast, For all my love is thine. III Let the gay world, with treach'rous art, Allure my eyes in vain: I have convey'd away my heart, Ne'er to return again. IV I feel my warmest passions dead To all that earth can boast: This soul of mine was never made For vanity and dust. V Now I can fix my thoughts above, Amidst their flatt'ring charms, Till the dear Lord that hath my love Shall call me to his arms. VI So Gabriel, at his King's command, From yon celestial hill, Walks downward to our worthless land, His soul points upward still. VII He glides along my mortal things, Without a thought of love, Fulfils his task, and spreads his wings To reach the realms above. Meditation in a Grove. I Sweet muse, descend and bless the shade, And bless the evening grove; Business, and noise, and day are fled, And every care, but love. II But hence, ye wanton young and fair, Mine is a purer flame; No Phillis shall infect the air, With her unhallowed name. III Jesus has all my powers possest, My hopes, my fears, my joys: He, the dear Sov'reign of my breast, Shall still command my voice. IV Some of the fairest choirs above Shall flock around my song, With joy to hear the name they love Sound from a mortal tongue. V His charms shall make my numbers flow, And hold the falling floods, While silence sits on ev'ry bough, And bends the list'ning woods. VI I'll carve our passion on the bark, And ev'ry wounded tree Shall drop and bear some mystic mark That Jesus dy'd for me. VII The swains shall wonder when they read, Inscrib'd on all the grove, That heav'n itself came down and bled To win a mortal's love. The Fairest and the only Beloved. I. Honour to that diviner ray That first allur'd my eyes away From ev'ry mortal fair; All the gay things that held my sight Seem but the twinkling sparks of night, And languishing in doubtful light Die at the morning-star. II. Whatever speaks the godhead great, And fit to be ador'd, Whatever makes the creature sweet, And worthy of my passion, meet Harmonious in my Lord. A thousand graces ever rise And bloom upon his face; A thousand arrows from his eyes Shoot thro' my heart with dear surprise, And guard around the place. III. All nature's art shall never cure The heav'nly pains I found, And 'tis beyond all beauty's pow'r To make another wound: Earthly beauties grow and fade; Nature heals the wounds she made, But charms so much divine Hold a long empire of the heart; What heav'n has join'd shall never part, And Jesus must be mine. IV. In vain the envious shades of night, Or flatteries of the day Would veil his image from my sight, Or tempt my soul away; Jesus is all my waking theme, His lovely form meets ev'ry dream And knows not to depart: The passion reigns Thro' all my veins, And floating round the crimson stream, Still finds him at my heart. V. Dwell there, for ever dwell, my Love; Here I confine my sense; Nor dare my wildest wishes rove Nor stir a thought from thence. Amidst thy glories and thy grace Let all my remnant-minutes pass; Grant, thou everlasting Fair, Grant my soul a mansion there: My soul aspires to see thy face Tho' life should for the vision pay; So rivers run to meet the sea, And lose their nature in th'embrace. VI. Thou art my Ocean, thou my God; In thee the passions of the mind With joys and freedom unconsin'd Exult, and spread their pow'rs abroad, Not all the glittering things on high Can make my heav'n, if thou remove; I shall be tir'd and long to die; Life is a pain without thy love; Who could ever bear to be Curst with immortality Among the stars, but far from thee? Mutual Love stronger than Death. I. Not the rich world of minds above Can pay the mighty debt of love I owe to Christ my God: With pangs which none but he could feel He brought my guilty soul from hell: Not the first seraph's tongue can tell The value of his blood. II. Kindly he seiz'd me in his arms, From the false world's pernicious charms With force divinely sweet. Had I ten thousand lives my own, At his demand, With cheerful hand, I'd pay the vital treasure down In hourly tributes at his feet. III. But, Saviour, let me taste thy grace With every fleeting breath; And thro' that heaven of pleasure pass To the cold arms of death; Then I could lose successive souls Fast as the minutes fly; So billow after billow rolls To kiss the shore and die. The substance of the following Copy, and many of the Lines were sent me by an esteemed Friend, Mr. W. Nokes, with a desire that I would form them into a Pindaric Ode; but I retained his measures, lest I should too much alter his sense. A Sight of Christ. Angels of light, your God and King surround, With noble songs; in his exalted flesh He claims your worship; while his saints on earth, Bless their Redeemer-God with humble tongues. Angels with lofty honours crown his head; We bowing at his feet, by faith, may feel His distant influence, and confess his love. Once I beheld his face, when beams divine Broke from his eye-lids, and unusual light Wrapt me at once in glory and surprise. My joyful heart, high leaping in my breast, With transport cry'd, ‘This is the Christ of God;’ Then threw my arms around in sweet embrace, And clasp'd, and bow'd adoring low, till I was lost in him. While he appears, no other charms can hold Or draw my soul, asham'd of former things, Which no remembrance now deserve, or name, Tho' with contempt; best in oblivion hid. But the bright shine &amp; presence soon withdrew; I sought him whom I love, but found him not; I felt his absence; and with strongest cries Proclaim'd, ‘Where Jesus is not, all is vain.’ Whether I hold him with a full delight, Or seek him panting with extreme desire, 'Tis he alone can please my wond'ring soul; To hold or seek him is my only choice. If he refrain on me to cast his eye Down from his palace, nor my longing soul With upward look can spy my dearest Lord Thro' his blue pavement, I'll behold him still With sweet reflection on the peaceful cross, All in his blood and anguish groaning deep, Gasping and dying there— This sight I ne'er can lose, by it I live: A quick'ning virtue from his death inspir'd Is life and breath to me; his flesh my food; His vital blood I drink, and hence my strength. I live, I'm strong, and now eternal life Beats quick within my breast, my vigorous mind Spurns the dull earth, and on her fiery wings Reaches the mount of purposes divine, Counsels of peace betwixt th'almighty Three Conceiv'd at once, and sign'd without debate In perfect union of th'eternal mind. With vast amaze I see th'unfathom'd thoughts, Infinite schemes, and infinite designs Of God's own heart, in which he ever rests. Eternity lies open to my view; Here the beginning and the end of all I can discover; Christ the end of all, And Christ the great beginning; he my head, My God, my glory, and my all in all. O that the day, the joyful day were come, When the first Adam from his ancient dust Crown'd with new honours shall revive, and see Jesus his Son and Lord; while shouting saints Surround their King, and God's eternal Son Shines in the midst, but with superior beams, And like himself; then the mysterious Word Long hid behind the letter shall appear All spirit and life, and in the fullest light Stand forth to public view; and there disclose His Father's sacred works, and wondrous ways; Then wisdom, righteousness and grace divine, Thro' all the infinite transactions past, Inwrought and shining, shall with double blaze Strike our astonish'd eyes, and ever reign Admir'd and glorious in triumphant light. Death and the tempter, and the man of sin Now at the bar arraign'd, in judgment cast, Shall vex the saints no more: But perfect love And loudest praises perfect joy create, While ever circling years maintain the blissful state. Love on a Cross, and a Throne. I Now let my faith grow strong, and rise And view my Lord in all his love; Look back to hear his dying cries, Then mount and see his throne above. II See where he languish'd on the cross; Beneath my sins he groan'd and dy'd; See where he sits to plead my cause By his almighty Father's side. III If I behold his bleeding heart, There love in floods of sorrow reigns, He triumphs o'er the killing smart, And buys my pleasure with his pains. IV Or if I climb th'eternal hills Where the dear Conqueror sits enthron'd, Still in his heart compassion dwells, Near the memorials of his wound. V How shall a pardon'd rebel show How much I love my dying God? Lord, here I banish ev'ry foe, I hate the sins that cost thy blood. VI I hold no more commerce with hell, My dearest lusts shall all depart; But let thine image ever dwell Stampt as a seal upon my heart. A Preparatory Thought for the Lord's-Supper. In Imitation of Isaiah lxiii. 1, 2, 3. I What heav'nly Man, or lovely God, Comes marching downward from the skies, Array'd in garments roll'd in blood, With joy and pity in his eyes? II The Lord! the Saviour! yes, 'tis he, I know him by the smiles he wears; Dear glorious Man that dy'd for me, Drench'd deep in agonies and tears! III Lo, he reveals his shining breast; I own those wounds, and I adore: Lo, he prepares a royal feast, Sweet fruit of the sharp pangs he bore! IV Whence flow these favours so divine! Lord, why so lavish of thy blood? Why for such earthly souls as mine, This heav'nly flesh, this sacred food? V 'Twas his own love that made him bleed, That nail'd him to the cursed tree; 'Twas his own love this table spread For such unworthy worms as we. VI Then let us taste the Saviour's love, Come, faith, and feed upon the Lord: With glad consent our lips shall move And sweet hosannas crown the board. Converse with Christ. I I'm tir'd with visits, modes, and forms, And flatteries made to fellow-worms: Their conversation cloys; Their vain amours, and empty stuff: But I can ne'er enjoy enough Of thy best company, my Lord, thou life of all my joys. II When he begins to tell his love, Thro' ev'ry vein my passions move, The captive of his tongue: In midnight shades, on frosty ground, I could attend the pleasing sound, Nor should I feel December cold, nor think the darkness long. III There, while I hear my Saviour-God Count o'er the sins (a heavy load) He bore upon the tree, Inward I blush with secret shame, And weep, and love, and bless the name That knew not guilt nor grief his own, but bare it all for me. IV Next he describes the thorns he wore, And talks his bloody passions o'er, Till I am drown'd in tears: Yet with the sympathetic smart There's a strange joy beats round my heart; The cursed tree has blessings in't, my sweetest balm it bears. V I hear the glorious Sufferer tell, How on his cross he vanquish'd hell, And all the powers beneath; Transported and inspir'd, my tongue Attempts his triumphs in a song: ‘How has the serpent lost his sting, and where's thy victory, death?’ VI But when he shows his hands and heart, With those dear prints of dying smart, He sets my soul on fire: Not the beloved John could rest With more delight upon that breast, Nor Thomas pry into those wounds with more intense desire. VII Kindly he opens me his ear, And bids me pour my sorrow there, And tell him all my pains: Thus while I ease my burden'd heart, In ev'ry woe he bears a part, His arms embrace me, and his hand my drooping head sustains. VIII Fly from my thoughts, all human things, And sporting swains, and fighting kings, And tales of wanton love: My soul disdains that little snare The tangles of Amira's hair: Thine arms, my God, are sweeter bands, nor can my heart remove. Grace shining and Nature fainting. Sol. Song i. 3. and ii. 5. and vi. 5. I. Tell me, fairest of thy kind, Tell me, Shepherd, all divine, Where this fainting head reclin'd May relieve such cares as mine: Shepherd, lead me to thy grove; If burning noon infect the sky The sick'ning sheep to covert fly, The sheep not half so faint as I, Thus overcome with love. II. Say, thou dear Sov'reign of my breast, Where dost thou lead thy flock to rest: Why should I appear like one Wild and wand'ring all alone, Unbeloved and unknown? O my great Redeemer, say, Shall I turn my feet astray! Will Jesus bear to see me rove, To see me seek another love? III. Ne'er had I known his dearest name, Ne'er had I felt this inward flame, Had not his heart-strings first began the tender sound: Nor can I bear the thought, that he Should leave the sky, Should bleed and die, Should love a wretch so vile as me Without returns of passion for his dying wound. IV. His eyes are glory mix'd with grace; In his delightful awful face Sits majesty and gentleness. So tender is my bleeding heart That with a frown he kills; His absence is perpetual smart, Nor is my soul refin'd enough To bear the beaming of his love, And feel his warmer smiles. Where shall I rest this drooping head; I love, I love the sun, and yet I want the shade. V. My sinking spirits feebly strive T'endure the ecstasy; Beneath these rays I cannot live, And yet without them die. None knows the pleasure and the pain That all my inward pow'rs sustain But such as feel a Saviour's love, and love the God again. VI. O why should beauty heav'nly bright Stoop to charm a mortal's sight, And torture with the sweet excess of light? Our hearts, alas! how frail their make! With their own weight of joy they break; Oh! why is love so strong, and nature's self so weak? VII. Turn, turn away thine eyes, Ascend the azure hills, and shine Amongst the happy tenants of the skies; They can sustain a vision so divine. O turn thy lovely glories from me, The joys are too intense, the glories overcome me. VIII. Dear Lord, forgive my rash complaint, And love me still Against my froward will; Unveil thy beauties, tho' I faint. Send the great herald from the sky, And at the trumpet's awful roar This feeble state of things shall fly, And pain and pleasure mix no more: Then shall I gaze with strengthened sight On glories infinitely bright, My heart shall all be love, my Jesus all delight. Love to Christ, present or absent. I Of all the joys we mortals know, Jesus, thy love exceeds the rest; Love, the best blessing here below, And nearest image of the blest. II Sweet are my thoughts, and soft my cares, When the celestial flame I feel; In all my hopes, and all my fears, There's something kind and pleasing still. III While I am held in his embrace There's not a thought attempts to rove; Each smile he wears upon his face Fixes, and charms, and fires my love. IV He speaks, and straight immortal joys Run through my ears, and reach my heart; My soul all melts at that dear voice, And pleasure shoots thro' ev'ry part. V If he withdraw a moment's space, He leaves a sacred pledge behind; Here in this breast his image stays, The grief and comfort of my mind. VI While of his absence I complain, And long, and weep as lovers do, There's a strange pleasure in the pain, And tears have their own sweetness too. VII When round his courts by day I rove, Or ask the watchman of the night For some kind tidings of my love, His very name creates delight. VIII Jesus, my God; yet rather come; Mine eyes would dwell upon thy face; 'Tis best to see my Lord at home, And feel the presence of his grace. The Absence of Christ. I Come, lead me to some lofty shade Where turtles moan their loves; Tall shadows were for lovers made; And grief becomes the groves. II 'Tis no mean beauty of the ground That has inslav'd mine eyes; I faint beneath a nobler wound, Nor love below the skies. III Jesus the spring of all that's bright, The everlasting fair, Heaven's ornament, and heaven's delight, Is my eternal care. IV But ah! how far above this grove Does the bright charmer dwell? Absence, thou keenest wound to love, That sharpest pain, I feel. V Pensive I climb the sacred hills, And near him vent my woes; Yet his sweet face he still conceals, Yet still my passion grows. VI I murmur to the hollow vale, I tell the rocks my flame, And bless the echo in her cell That best repeats her name. VII My passion breathes perpetual sighs, Till pitying winds shall hear, And gently bear them up the skies, And gently wound his ear. Desiring his Descent to Earth. I Jesus, I love. Come, dearest name, Come and possess this heart of mine; I love, tho' 'tis a fainter flame, And infinitely less than thine. II O! if my Lord would leave the skies, Drest in the rays of mildest grace, My soul should hasten to my eyes, To meet the pleasures of his face. III How would I feast on all his charms, Then round his lovely feet entwine! Worship and love in all their forms, Should honour beauty so divine. IV In vain the tempter's flatt'ring tongue, The world in vain should bid me move, In vain; for I should gaze so long Till I were all transform'd to love. V Then, mighty God, I'd sing and say, ‘What empty names are crowns and kings! ‘Amongst 'em give these worlds away, ‘These little despicable things.’ VI I would not ask to climb the sky, Nor envy angels their abode, I have a heav'n as bright and high In the blest vision of my God. Ascending to him in Heaven. I 'Tis pure delight, without alloy, Jesus, to hear thy name, My spirit leaps with inward joy, I feel the sacred flame. II My passions hold a pleasing reign, While love inspires my breast, Love, the divinest of the train, The sov'reign of the rest. III This is the grace must live and sing, When faith and fear shall cease, Must sound from ev'ry joyful string Thro' the sweet groves of bliss. IV Let life immortal seize my clay; Let love refine my blood; Her flames can bear my soul away, Can bring me near my God. V Swift I ascend the heav'nly place, And hasten to my home, I leap to meet thy kind embrace, I come, O Lord, I come. VI Sink down, ye separating hills, Let guilt and death remove, 'Tis love that drives my chariot wheels, And death must yield to love. The Presence of God worth dying for; or, the Death of Moses. I Lord, 'tis an infinite delight To see thy lovely face, To dwell whole ages in thy sight, And feel thy vital rays. II This Gabriel knows; and sings thy name With rapture on his tongue; Moses the saint enjoys the same, And heav'n repeats the song. III While the bright nation sounds thy praise From each eternal hill, Sweet odours of exhaling grace The happy region fill. IV Thy love, a sea without a shore, Spreads life and joy abroad: O 'tis a heav'n worth dying for To see a smiling God! V Show me thy face, and I'll away From all inferior things: Speak, Lord, and here I quit my clay, And stretch my airy wings. VI Sweet was the journey to the sky The wondrous prophet try'd; ‘Climb up the mount.’ says God, ‘and die,’ The prophet climb'd and dy'd. VII Softly his fainting head he lay Upon his Maker's breast, His Maker kiss'd his soul away, And laid his flesh to rest. VIII In God's own arms he left the breath That God's own Spirit gave; His was the noblest road to death, And his the sweetest grave. Long for his Return. I O 'twas a mournful parting day! ‘Farewell, my spouse,’ he said; (How tedious, Lord, is thy delay! How long my love hath stay'd!) II Farewell; at once he left the ground, And climb'd his Father's sky: Lord, I would tempt thy chariot down, Or leap to thee on high. III Round the creation wild I rove, And search the globe in vain; There's nothing here that's worth my love Till thou return again. IV My passions fly to seek their King, And send their groans abroad, They beat the air with heavy wing, And mourn an absent God: V With inward pain my heart-strings sound, My soul dissolves away; Dear Sov'reign, whirl the seasons round, And bring the promis'd day. Hope in Darkness. 1694. I. Yet, gracious God, Yet will I seek thy smiling face; What tho' a short eclipse his beauties shroud And bar the influence of his rays, 'Tis but a morning vapour, or a summer cloud: He is my Sun tho' he refuse to shine, Tho' for a moment he depart I dwell for ever on his heart, For ever he on mine. Early before the light arise I'll spring a thought away to God; The passion of my heart and eyes Shall shout a thousand groans and sighs, A thousand glances strike the skies, The floor of his abode. II. Dear Sov'reign, hear thy servant pray, Bend the blue heav'ns, eternal King, Downward thy cheerful graces bring; Or shall I breathe in vain and pant my hours away? Break, glorious Brightness, thro' the gloomy veil, Look how the armies of despair Aloft their sooty banners rear Round my poor captive soul, and dare Pronounce me prisoner of hell, But thou, my Sun, and thou, my Shield, Wilt save me in the bloody field; Break, glorious Brightness, shoot one glimm'ring ray, One glance of thine creates a day, And drives the troops of hell away. III. Happy the times, but ah! the times are gone When wondrous pow'r and radiant grace Round the tall arches of the temple shone, And mingled their victorious rays: Sin, with all its ghastly train, Fled to the deeps of death again, And smiling triumph sat on every face: Our spirits raptur'd with the sight Were all devotion, all delight, And loud hosannas sounded the Redeemer's praise. Here could I say, (And point the place whereon I stood) Here I enjoy'd a visit half the day From my descending God: I was regal'd with heav'nly fare, With fruit and manna from above; Divinely sweet the blessings were While mine Emanuel was there: And o'er my head The conqueror spread The banner of his love. IV. Then why my heart sunk down so low? Why do my eyes dissolve and flow, And hopeless nature mourn? Review, my soul, those pleasing days, Read his unalterable grace Thro' the displeasure of his face, And wait a kind return. A father's love may raise a frown To chide the child, or prove the son, But love will ne'er destroy; The hour of darkness is but short, Faith be thy life, and patience thy support, The morning brings the joy. Come, Lord Jesus. I When shall thy lovely face be seen? When shall our eyes behold our God? What lengths of distance lie between, And hills of guilt? a heavy load! II Our months are ages of delay, And slowly every minute wears: Fly, winged time, and roll away These tedious rounds of sluggish years. III Ye heav'nly gates, loose all your chains, Let the eternal pillars bow; Blest Saviour, cleave the starry plains, And make the crystal mountains flow. IV Hark, how thy saints unite their cries, And pray and wait the general doom; Come, thou, the soul of all our joys, Thou, the desire of nations, come. V Put thy bright robes of triumph on, And bless our eyes, and bless our ears, Thou absent love, thou dear unknown, Thou Fairest of ten thousand fairs. VI Our heart-strings groan with deep complaint, Our flesh lies panting, Lord, for thee, And ev'ry limb, and ev'ry joint, Stretches for immortality. VII Our spirits shake their eager wings, And burn to meet thy flying throne; We rise away from mortal things T'attend thy shining chariot down. VIII Now let our cheerful eyes survey The blazing earth and melting hills, And smile to see the lightnings play, And flash along before thy wheels. IX O for a shout of violent joys To join the trumpet's thund'ring sound! The angel herald shakes the skies, Awakes the graves and tears the ground. X Ye slumb'ring saints, a heav'nly host Stands waiting at your gaping tombs; Let ev'ry sacred sleeping dust Leap into life, for Jesus comes. XI Jesus, the God of might and love, New-moulds our limbs of cumb'rous clay; Quick as seraphic flames we move, Active and young, and fair as they. XII Our airy feet with unknown flight, Swift as the motions of desire, Run up the hills of heav'nly light, And leave the welt'ring world in fire. Bewailing my own Inconstancy. I I love the Lord; but ah! how far My thoughts from the dear object are! This wanton heart, how wide it roves! And fancy meets a thousand loves. II If my soul burn to see my God, I tread the courts of his abode, But troops of rivals throng the place And tempt me off before his face. III Would I enjoy my Lord alone, I bid my passions all be gone, All but my love; and charge my will To bar the door and guard it still. IV But cares, or trifles, make, or find, Still new avenues to the mind, Till I with grief and wonder see Huge crowds betwixt the Lord and me V Oft I am told the muse will prove A friend to piety and love; Straight I begin some sacred song, And take my Saviour on my tongue. VI Strangely I lose his lovely face, To hold the empty sounds in chase; At best the chimes divide my heart, And the muse shares the larger part. VII False confident! and falser breast! Fickle, and fond of ev'ry guest: Each airy image as it flies, Here finds admittance thro' my eyes. VIII This foolish heart can leave her God, And shadows tempt her thoughts abroad: How shall I fix this wand'ring mind? Or throw my fetters on the wind? IX Look gently down, almighty Grace, Prison me round in thine embrace; Pity the soul that would be thine, And let thy pow'r my love confine. X Say, when shall thy bright moment be That I shall live alone for thee, My heart no foreign lords adore, And the wild muse prove false no more? Forsaken, yet hoping. I Happy the hours, the golden days, When I could call my Jesus mine, And sit and view his smiling face, And melt in pleasures all divine. II Near to my heart, within my arms He lay, till sin defil'd my breast, Till broken vows, and earthly charms, Tir'd and provok'd my heav'nly guest. III And now he's gone, O mighty woe! Gone from my soul, and hides his love! Curse on you, sins, that griev'd him so, Ye sins, that forc'd him to remove. IV Break, break, my heart; complain, my tongue; Hither, my friends, your sorrows bring: Angels, assist my doleful song, If you have e'er a mourning string. V But ah! your joys are ever high, Ever his lovely face you see; While my poor spirits pant and die, And groan, for thee, my God, for thee. VI Yet let my hope look thro' my tears, And spy afar his rolling throne; His chariot thro' the cleaving spheres Shall bring the bright Beloved down. VII Swift as a roe flies o'er the hills, My soul springs out to meet him high, Then the fair Conqueror turns his wheels, And climbs the mansions of the sky. VIII There smiling joy for ever reigns, No more the turtle leaves the dove; Farewell to jealousies, and pains, And all the ills of absent love. THE CONCLUSION. God exalted above all Praise. I Eternal pow'r! whose high abode Becomes the grandeur of a God; Infinite length beyond the bounds Where stars revolve their little rounds. II The lowest step above thy seat Rises too high for Gabriel's feet, In vain the tall archangel tries To reach thine height with wond'ring eyes. III Thy dazzling beauties whilst he sings He hides his face behind his wings; And ranks of shining thrones around Fall worshipping, and spread the ground. IV Lord, what shall earth and ashes do? We would adore our Maker too; From sin and dust to thee we cry, ‘The Great, the Holy, and the High!’ V Earth from afar has heard thy fame, And worms have learnt to lisp thy name; But O, the glories of thy mind Leave all our soaring thoughts behind. VI God is in heav'n, and men below; Be short our tunes; our words be few; A sacred reverence checks our songs, And praise sits silent on our tongues. Tibi silet laus, O Deus, Psalm lxv. 1. END OF THE FIRST BOOK. BOOK II. SACRED TO VIRTUE, HONOUR AND FRIENDSHIP. TO HER MAJESTY. Queen of the northern world, whose gentle sway Commands our love, and charms our hearts t'obey, Forgive the nation's groan when William dy'd: Lo, at thy feet in all the loyal pride Of blooming joy, three happy realms appear, And William's urn almost without a tear Stands; nor complains: while from thy gracious tongue Peace flows in silver streams amidst the throng. Amazing balm that on those lips was found To sooth the torment of that mortal wound, And calm the wild affright! The terror dies, The bleeding wound cements, the danger flies, And Albion shouts thine honours as her joys arise. The German eagle feels her guardian dead, Not her own thunder can secure her head; Her trembling eaglets hasten from afar, And Belgia's lion dreads the Gallic war: All hide behind thy shield. Remoter lands Whose lives lay trusted in Nassovian hands Transfer their souls, and live; secure they play In thy mild rays, and love the growing day. Thy beamy wing at once defends and warms Fainting religion, whilst in various forms Fair piety shines thro' the British isles: Here at thy side, and in thy kindest smiles The established church of England. Blazing in ornamental gold she stands, To bless thy counsels, and assist thy hands, And crowds wait round her to receive commands. There at a humble distance from the throne The protestant dissenters. Beauteous she lies: Her lustre all her own, Ungarnish'd; yet not blushing, nor afraid, Nor knows suspicion, nor affects the shade: Cheerful and pleas'd she not presumes to share In thy parental gifts, but owns thy guardian care. For thee, dear Sov'reign, endless vows arise, And zeal with earthly wing salutes the skies To gain thy safety: Here a solemn form The established church of England. Of ancient words keeps the devotion warm, And guides, but bounds our wishes: There the mind The protestant dissenters. Feels its own fire, and kindles unconfin'd With bolder hopes: Yet still beyond our vows Thy lovely glories rise, thy spreading terror grows. Princess, the world already owns thy name: Go, mount the chariot of immortal fame, Nor die to be renown'd: Fame's loudest breath Too dear is purchas'd by an angel's death. The vengeance of thy rod, with general joy, Shall scourge rebellion and the rival boy: The pretender. Thy sounding arms his Gallic patron hears And speeds his flight; not overtakes his fears, Till hard despair wring from the tyrant's soul The iron tears out. Let thy frown control Our angry jars at home, till wrath submit Her impious banners to thy sacred feet. Mad zeal and frenzy, with their murderous train, Flee these sweet realms in thine auspicious reign, Envy expire in rage, and treason bite the chain. Let no black scenes affright fair Albion's stage: Thy thread of life prolong our golden age, Long bless the earth, and late ascend thy throne Ethereal; (not thy deeds are there unknown, Nor there unsung; for by thine awful hands Heav'n rules the waves, and thunders o'er the lands, Creates inferior kings, She made Charles the emperor's second son king of Spain, who is now emperor of Germany. and gives 'em their commands.) Legions attend thee at the radiant gates; For thee thy sister-seraph, blest Maria, waits. But oh! the parting stroke! some heavenly pow'r Cheer thy sad Britons in the gloomy hour; Some new propitious star appear on high The fairest glory of the western sky, And Anna be its name; with gentle sway To check the planets of malignant ray, Sooth the rude north wind, and the rugged bear, Calm rising wars, heal the contagious air, And reign with peaceful influence to the southern sphere. Note, This poem was written in the year 1705, in that honourable part of the reign of our late Queen, when she had broke the French power at Blenheim, asserted the right of Charles the present Emperor to the crown of Spain, exerted her zeal for the protestant succession, and promised inviolably to maintain the toleration to the protestant dissenters.—Thus she appeared the chief support of the Reformation, and the patroness of the liberties of Europe. The latter part of her reign was of a different colour, and was by no means attended with the accomplishment of those glorious hopes which we had conceived. Now the muse cannot satisfy herself to publish this new edition without acknowledging the mistake of her former presages; and while she does the world this justice, she does herself the honour of a voluntary retractation. August 1, 1721. PALINODIA. Britons, forgive the forward muse That dar'd prophetic seals to loose, (Unskill'd in fate's eternal book,) And the deep characters mistook. George is the name, that glorious star; Ye saw his splendors beaming far; Saw in the east your joys arise, When Anna sunk in western skies, Streaking the heav'ns with crimson gloom, Emblems of tyranny and Rome, Portending blood and night to come. 'Twas George diffus'd a vital ray, And gave the dying nations day: His influence sooths the Russian bear, Calms rising wars, and heals the air; Join'd with the sun his beams are hurl'd To scatter blessings round the world, Fulfil whate'er the muse has spoke, And crown the work that Anne forsook. August 1, 1721. TO JOHN LOCKE, ESQ. Retired from Business. I. Angels are made of heav'nly things, And light and love our souls compose, Their bliss within their bosom springs, Within their bosom flows. But narrow minds still make pretence To search the coasts of flesh and sense, And fetch diviner pleasures thence. Men are a-kin to ethereal forms, But they bely their nobler birth, Debase their honour down to earth, And claim a share with worms. II. He that has treasures of his own May leave the cottage or the throne, May quit the globe, and dwell alone Within his spacious mind. Locke hath a soul wide as the sea, Calm as the night, bright as the day, There may his vast ideas play, Nor feel a thought confin'd. TO JOHN SHUTE, ESQ. (NOW LORD BARRINGTON.) On Mr. Locke's dangerous Sickness, some time after he had retired to study the Scriptures. June, 1704. I And must the man of wondrous mind (Now his rich thoughts are just refin'd) Forsake our longing eyes? Reason at length submits to wear The wings of faith; and lo, they rear Her chariot high, and nobly bear Her Prophet to the skies. II Go, friend, and wait the Prophet's flight, Watch if his mantle chance to light, And seize it for thy own; Shute is the darling of his years, Young Shute his better likeness bears; All but his wrinkles and his hairs Are copy'd in his Son. III Thus when our follies, or our fau'ts, Call for the pity of thy thoughts, Thy pen shall make us wise: The sallies of whose youthful wit Could pierce the British fogs with light, Place our true The Interest of England, written by I. S. Esq. interest in our sight, And open half our eyes. TO MR. WILLIAM NOKES. Friendship. 1702. I Friendship, thou charmer of the mind, Thou sweet deluding ill, The brightest minute mortals find, And sharpest hour we feel. II Fate has divided all our shares Of pleasure and of pain; In love the comforts and the cares Are mix'd and join'd again. III But whilst in floods our sorrow rolls, And drops of joy are few, This dear delight of mingling souls Serves but to swell our woe. IV Oh! why should bliss depart in haste, And friendship stay to moan? Why the fond passion cling so fast, When ev'ry joy is gone? V Yet never let our hearts divide, Nor death dissolve the chain: For love and joy were once ally'd, And must be join'd again. TO NATHANIEL GOULD, ESQ. (NOW SIR NATHANIEL GOULD.) 1704. I. Tis not by splendor, or by state, Exalted mien, or lofty gate, My muse takes measure of a king: If wealth, or height, or bulk will do, She calls each mountain of Peru A more majestic thing. Frown on me, friend, if e'er I boast O'er fellow-minds inslav'd in clay, Or swell when I shall have ingrost A larger heap of shining dust, And wear a bigger load of earth than they. Let the vain world salute me loud, My thoughts look inward, and forget The sounding names of High and Great, The flatteries of the crowd. II. When Gould commands his ships to run And search the traffic of the sea, His fleet o'ertakes the falling day, And bears the western mines away, Or richer spices from the rising sun: While the glad tenants of the shore Shout, and pronounce him senator, Member of parliament for a port in Sussex. Yet still the man's the same: For well the happy merchant knows The soul with treasure never grows, Nor swells with airy fame. III. But trust me, Gould, 'tis lawful pride To rise above the mean control Of flesh and sense, to which we're ty'd; This is ambition that becomes a soul. We steer our course up thro' the skies; Farewell this barren land: We ken the heav'nly shore with longing eyes, There the dear wealth of spirits lies, And beck'ning angels stand. TO DR. THOMAS GIBSON. The Life of Souls. 1704. I. Swift as the sun revolves the day We hasten to the dead, Slaves to the wind we puff away, And to the ground we tread. 'Tis air that lends us life, when first The vital bellows heave: Our flesh we borrow of the dust; And when a mother's care has nurst The babe to manly size, we must With usury pay the grave. II. Rich juleps drawn from precious ore Still tend the dying flame: And plants, and roots, of barbarous name, Torn from the Indian shore. Thus we support our tott'ring flesh, Our cheeks resume the rose afresh, When bark and steel play well their game To save our sinking breath, And Gibson, with his awful power, Rescues the poor precarious hour From the demands of death. III. But art and nature, pow'rs and charms, And drugs, and recipes, and forms, Yield us, at last, to greedy worms A despicable prey; I'd have a life to call my own, That shall depend on heav'n alone; Nor air, nor earth, nor sea Mix their base essences with mine, Nor claim dominion so divine To give me leave to be. IV. Sure there's a mind within, that reigns O'er the dull current of my veins; I feel the inward pulse beat high With vig'rous immortality. Let earth resume the flesh it gave, And breath dissolve amongst the winds; Gibson, the things that fear a grave, That I can lose, or you can save, Are not a-kin to minds. V. We claim acquaintance with the skies, Upward our spirits hourly rise, And there our thoughts employ: When heav'n shall sign our grand release, We are no strangers to the place, The business, or the joy. False Greatness. I. Mylo, forbear to call him blest That only boasts a large estate, Should all the treasures of the west Meet, and conspire to make him great. I know thy better thoughts, I know Thy reason can't descend so low. Let a broad stream with golden sands Thro' all his meadows roll, He's but a wretch, with all his lands, That wears a narrow soul. II. He swells amidst his wealthy store, And proudly poizing what he weighs, In his own scale he fondly lays Huge heaps of shining ore. He spreads the balance wide to hold His manors and his farms, And cheats the beam with loads of gold He hugs between his arms. So might the plough-boy climb a tree, When Crœsus mounts his throne, And both stand up, and smile to see How long their shadow's grown. Alas! how vain their fancies be To think that shape their own! III. Thus mingled still with wealth and state, Crœsus himself can never know His true dimensions, and his weight Are far inferior to their show. Were I so tall to reach the pole, Or grasp the ocean with my span, I must be measur'd by my soul: The mind's the standard of the man. TO SARISSA. An Epistle. Bear up, Sarissa, thro' the ruffling storms Of a vain vexing world: Tread down the cares Those ragged thorns that lie across the road, Nor spend a tear upon them. Trust the muse, She sings experienc'd truth: This briny dew, This rain of eyes will make the briers grow: We travel thro' a desert, and our feet Have measur'd a fair space, have left behind A thousand dangers, and a thousand snares Well scap'd. Adieu, ye horrors of the dark, Ye finish'd labours, and ye tedious toils Of days and hours: The twinge of real smart, And the false terrors of ill-boding dreams Vanish together, be alike forgot, For ever blended in one common grave. Farewell, ye waxing and ye waning moons, That we have watch'd behind the flying clouds On night's dark hill, or setting or ascending, Or in meridian height: Then silence reign'd O'er half the world; then ye beheld our tears, Ye witness'd our complaints, our kindred groans, (Sad harmony!) while with your beamy horns, Or richer orb ye silver'd o'er the green Where trod our feet, and lent a feeble light To mourners. Now ye have fulfill'd your round, Those hours are fled, farewell. Months that are gone Are gone for ever, and have borne away Each his own load. Our woes and sorrows past, Mountainous woes, still lessen as they fly Far off. So billows in a stormy sea, Wave after wave (a long succession) roll Beyond the ken of sight: The sailors safe Look far a-stern till they have lost the storm, And shout their boisterous joys. A gentler muse Sings thy dear safety, and commands thy cares To dark oblivion; bury'd deep in night Lose them, Sarissa, and assist my song. Awake thy voice, sing how the slender line Of fate's immortal now divides the past From all the future, with eternal bars Forbidding a return. The past temptations No more shall vex us; every grief we feel Shortens the destin'd number; every pulse Beats a sharp moment of the pain away, And the last stroke will come. By swift degrees Time sweeps us off, and we shall soon arrive At life's sweet period: O celestial point That ends this mortal story! But if a glimpse of light with flatt'ring ray Breaks thro' the clouds of life, or wand'ring fire Amidst the shades invite your doubtful feet, Beware the dancing meteor; faithless guide, That leads the lonesome pilgrim wide astray To bogs, and fens, and pits, and certain death! Should vicious pleasure take an angel-form And at a distance rise, by slow degrees, Treacherous, to wind herself into your heart, Stand firm aloof; nor let the gaudy phantom Too long allure your gaze: The just delight That heav'n indulges lawful, must obey Superior powers; nor tempt your thoughts too far In slavery to sense, nor swell your hope To dang'rous size: If it approach your feet And court your hand, forbid th'intruding joy To sit too near your heart: Still may our souls Claim kindred with the skies, nor mix with dust Our better-born affections; leave the globe A nest for worms, and hasten to our home. O there are gardens of th'immortal kind That crown the heav'nly Eden's rising hills With beauty and with sweets; no lurking mischief Dwells in the fruit, nor serpent twines the bough; The branches bend laden with life and bliss Ripe for the taste, but 'tis a steep ascent; Hold fast the golden The Gospel. chain let down from heav'n, 'Twill help your feet and wings; I feel its force Draw upwards; fasten'd to the pearly gate It guides the way unerring: Happy clue Thro' this dark wild! 'Twas wisdom's noblest work, All join'd by pow'r divine, and every link is love. TO MR. T. BRADBURY. Paradise. 1708. I. Young as I am I quit the stage, Nor will I know th'applauses of the age; Farewell to growing fame. I leave below A life not half worn out with cares, Or agonies, or years; I leave my country all in tears, But heaven demands me upward, and I dare to go. Amongst ye, friends, divide and share The remnant of my days, If ye have patience, and can bear A long fatigue of life, and drudge thro' all the race. II. Hark, my fair guardian chides my stay, And waves his golden rod: ‘Angel, I come; lead on the way:’ And now by swift degrees I sail aloft thro' azure seas, Now tread the milky road: Farewell, ye planets, in your spheres; And as the stars are lost, a brighter sky appears. In haste for Paradise I stretch the pinions of a bolder thought; Scarce had I will'd, but I was past Deserts of trackless light and all th'ethereal waste, And to the sacred borders brought; There on the wing a guard of cherubs lies, Each waves a keen flame as he flies, And well defends the walls from sieges and surprise. III. With pleasing rev'rence I behold The pearly portals wide unfold: Enter, my soul, and view th'amazing scenes; Sit fast upon the flying muse, And let thy roving wonder loose O'er all th'empyreal plains. Noon stands eternal here: here may thy sight Drink in the rays of primogenial light; Here breathe immortal air: Joy must beat high in ev'ry vein, Pleasure thro' all thy bosom reign; The laws forbid the stranger, pain, And banish every care. IV. See how the bubbling springs of love Beneath the throne arise; The streams in crystal channels move, Around the golden streets they rove, And bless the mansions of the upper skies. There a fair grove of knowledge grows, Nor sin nor death infects the fruit; Young life hangs fresh on all the boughs, And springs from ev'ry root; Here may thy greedy senses feast While ecstasy and health attend on every taste. With the fair prospect charm'd I stood; Fearless I feed on the delicious fare, And drink profuse salvation from the silver flood, Nor can excess be there. V. In sacred order rang'd along Saints new-releas'd by death Join the bold seraph's warbling breath, And aid th'immortal song. Each has a voice that tunes his strings To mighty sounds, and mighty things, Things of everlasting weight, Sounds, like the softer viol, sweet, And, like the trumpet, strong. Divine attention held my soul, I was all ear! Thro' all my pow'rs the heav'nly accents roll. I long'd and wish'd my Bradbury there; ‘Could he but hear these notes,’ I said, ‘His tuneful soul wou'd never bear ‘The dull unwinding of life's tedious thread, ‘But burst the vital cords to reach the happy dead.’ VI. And now my tongue prepares to join The harmony, and with a noble aim Attempts th'unutterable name, But faints, confounded by the notes divine: Again my soul th'unequal honour sought, Again her utmost force she brought, And bow'd beneath the burden of th'unwieldy thought. Thrice I essay'd, and fainted thrice; Th'immortal labour strain'd my feeble frame, Broke the bright vision, and dissolv'd the dream I sunk at once and lost the skies: In vain I sought the scenes of light Rolling abroad my longing eyes, For all around 'em stood my curtains and the night. Strict Religion very rare. I. I'm borne aloft, and leave the crowd, I sail upon a morning cloud Skirted with dawning gold: Mine eyes beneath the opening day Command the globe with wide survey, Where ants in busy millions play, And tug and heave the mould. II. ‘Are these the things,’ my passion cry'd, ‘That we call men? Are these ally'd ‘To the fair worlds of light? ‘They have ras'd out their Maker's name, ‘Grav'n on their minds with pointed flame ‘In strokes divinely bright. III. ‘Wretches! they hate their native skies; ‘If an ethereal thought arise, ‘Or spark of virtue shine, ‘With cruel force they damp its plumes, ‘Choak the young fire with sensual fumes, ‘With business, lust or wine. IV. ‘Lo! how they throng with panting breath ‘The broad descending road ‘That leads unerring down to death, ‘Nor miss the dark abode.’ Thus while I drop a tear or two On the wild herd, a noble few Dare to stray upward, and pursue Th'unbeaten way to God. V. I meet Myrtillo mounting high, I know his candid soul afar; Here Dorylus and Thyrsis fly, Each like a rising star, Charin I saw and Fidea there, I saw them help each other's flight, And bless them as they go; They soar beyond my lab'ring sight, And leave their loads of mortal care But not their love below. On heav'n their home, they fix their eyes, The temple of their God: With morning incense up they rise Sublime, and thro' the lower skies Spread the perfumes abroad. VI. Across the road a seraph flew, ‘Mark,’ said he, ‘that happy pair, ‘Marriage helps devotion there: ‘When kindred minds their God pursue ‘They break with double vigour thro' ‘The dull incumbent air.’ Charm'd with the pleasure and surprise My soul adores and sings, ‘Blest be the pow'r that springs their flight, ‘That streaks their path with heav'nly light, ‘That turns their love to sacrifice, ‘And joins their zeal for wings.’ TO MR. C. AND S. FLEETWOOD. I. Fleetwoods, young generous pair, Despise the joys that fools pursue; Bubbles are light and brittle too, Born of the water and the air. Try'd by a standard bold and just Honour and gold and paint and dust; How vile the last is and as vain the first? Things that the crowd call great and brave, With me how low their value's brought? Titles and names, and life and breath, Slaves to the wind and born for death; The soul's the only thing we have Worth an important thought. II. The soul! 'tis of th'immortal kind, Nor form'd of fire, or earth, or wind, Outlives the mouldring corpse, and leaves the globe behind. In limbs of clay tho' she appears, Array'd in rosy skin, and deck'd with ears and eyes, The flesh is but the soul's disguise, There's nothing in her frame 'kin to the dress she wears: From all the laws of matter free, From all we feel, and all we see, She stands eternally distinct, and must for ever be. III. Rise then, my thoughts, on high, Soar beyond all that's made to die; Lo! on an awful throne Sits the Creator and the Judge of souls, Whirling the planets round the poles, Winds off our threads of life, and brings our periods on. Swift the approach, and solemn is the day, When this immortal mind Stript of the body's coarse array To endless pain, or endless joy Must be at once consign'd. IV. Think of the sands run down to waste, We possess none of all the past, None but the present is our own; Grace is not plac'd within our pow'r, 'Tis but one short, one shining hour, Bright and declining as a setting sun, See the white minutes wing'd with haste; The now that flies may be the last; Seize the salvation ere 'tis past, Nor mourn the blessing gone: A thought's delay is ruin here, A closing eye, a gasping breath Shuts up the golden scene in death, And drowns you in despair. TO WILLIAM BLACKBOURN, ESQ. Casimir. lib. ii. od. 2. Imitated. Quæ tegit canas modo Bruma valles, &amp;c. I Mark how it snows! how fast the valley fills! And the sweet groves the hoary garment wear; Yet the warm sun-beams bounding from the hills Shall melt the veil away, and the young green appear. II But when old age has on your temples shed Her silver-frost, there's no returning sun; Swift flies our autumn, swift our summer's fled, When youth, and love, and spring, and golden joys are gone. III Then cold, and winter, and your aged snow, Stick fast upon you; not the rich array, Not the green garland, nor the rosy bough Shall cancel or conceal the melancholy gray. IV The chase of pleasures is not worth the pains, While the bright sands of health run wasting down; And honour calls you from the softer scenes, To sell the gaudy hour for ages of renown. V 'Tis but one youth, and short, that mortals have, And one old age dissolves our feeble frame; But there's a heav'nly art t'elude the grave, And with the hero-race immortal kindred claim. VI The man that has his country's sacred tears Bedewing his cold hearse, has liv'd his day: Thus, Blackbourn, we should leave our names our heirs; Old time and waning moons sweep all the rest away. True Monarchy. 1701. The rising year beheld th'imperious Gaul Stretch his dominion, while a hundred towns Crouch'd to the victor; but a steady soul Stands firm on its own base, and reigns as wide, As absolute; and sways ten thousand slaves, Lusts and wild fancies with a sovereign hand. We are a little kingdom; but the man That chains his rebel will to reason's throne, Forms it a large one, whilst his royal mind Makes heav'n its council, from the rolls above Draws his own statutes, and with joy obeys. 'Tis not a troop of well-appointed guards Create a monarch, not a purple robe Dy'd in the people's blood, not all the crowns Or dazzling tiars that bend about the head, Tho' gilt with sun-beams and set round with stars. A monarch he that conquers all his fears, And treads upon them; when he stands alone, Makes his own camp; four guardian virtues wait His nightly slumbers, and secure his dreams. Now dawns the light; he ranges all his thoughts In square battalions, bold to meet th'attacks Of time and chance, himself a num'rous host All eye, all ear, all wakeful as the day, Firm as a rock, and moveless as the centre. In vain the harlot, pleasure, spreads her charms, To lull his thoughts in luxury's fair lap, To sensual ease, (the bane of little kings, Monarchs whose waxen images of souls Are moulded into softness) still his mind Wears its own shape, nor can the heavenly form Stoop to be model'd by the wild decrees Of the mad vulgar, that unthinking herd. He lives above the crowd, nor hears the noise Of wars and triumphs, nor regards the shouts Of popular applause, that empty sound; Nor feels the flying arrows of reproach, Or spite or envy. In himself secure, Wisdom his tower, and conscience is his shield, His peace all inward, and his joys his own. Now my ambition swells, my wishes soar, This be my kingdom: Sit above the globe My rising soul, and dress thyself around And shine in virtue's armour, climb the height Of wisdom's lofty castle, there reside Safe from the smiling and the frowning world. Yet once a day drop down a gentle look On the great mole-hill, and with pitying eye Survey the busy emmets round the heap, Crowding and bustling in a thousand forms Of strife and toil, to purchase wealth and fame, A bubble or a dust: Then call thy thoughts Up to thyself to feed on joys unknown, Rich without gold, and great without renown. True Courage. Honour demands my song. Forget the ground, My generous muse, and sit amongst the stars! There sing the soul, that, conscious of her birth, Lives like a native of the vital world, Amongst these dying clods, and bears her state Just to herself: How nobly she maintains Her character, superior to the flesh, She wields her passions like her limbs, and knows The brutal powers were only born t'obey. This is the man whom storms could never make Meanly complain; nor can a flatt'ring gale Make him talk proudly: He hath no desire To read his secret fate; yet unconcern'd And calm could meet his unborn destiny, In all its charming, or its frightful shapes. He that unshrinking, and without a groan, Bears the first wound, may finish all the war With mere courageous silence, and come off Conqueror: For the man that well conceals The heavy strokes of fate, he bears 'em well. He, tho' th'Atlantic and the Midland seas With adverse surges meet, and rise on high Suspended 'twixt the winds, then rush amain Mingled with flames, upon his single head, And clouds, and stars, and thunder, firm he stands, Secure of his best life; unhurt, unmov'd; And drops his lower nature, born for death. Then from the lofty castle of his mind Sublime looks down, exulting, and surveys The ruins of creation; (souls alone Are heirs of dying worlds;) a piercing glance Shoots upwards from between his closing lids, To reach his birth-place, and without a sigh He bids his batter'd flesh lie gently down Amongst its native rubbish; whilst the spirit Breathes and flies upward, an undoubted guest Of the third heav'n, th'unruinable sky. Thither, when fate has brought our willing souls, No matter whether 'twas a sharp disease, Or a sharp sword, that help'd the travellers on, And push'd us to our home. Bear up, my friend, Serenely, and break thro' the stormy brine With steady prow; know, we shall once arrive At the fair haven of eternal bliss, To which we ever steer; whether as kings Of wide command we've spread the spacious sea With a broad painted fleet, or row'd along In a thin cock-boat with a little oar. There let my native plank shift me to land And I'll be happy: Thus I'll leap ashore Joyful and fearless on th'immortal coast, Since all I leave is mortal, and it must be lost. TO THE MUCH HONOURED MR. THOMAS ROWE, THE DIRECTOR OF MY YOUTHFUL STUDIES. Free Philosophy. I. Custom, that tyranness of fools, That leads the learned round the schools, In magic chains of forms and rules! My genius storms her throne: No more, ye slaves, with awe profound Beat the dull track, nor dance the round; Loose hands, and quit th'inchanted ground: Knowledge invites us each alone. II. I hate these shackles of the mind Forg'd by the haughty wise; Souls were not born to be confin'd, And led, like Sampson, blind and bound; But when his native strength he found He well aveng'd his eyes. I love thy gentle influence, Rowe, Thy gentle influence like the sun, Only dissolves the frozen snow, Then bids our thoughts like rivers flow, And choose the channels where they run. III. Thoughts should be free as fire or wind; The pinions of a single mind Will thro' all nature fly: But who can drag up to the poles Long fetter'd ranks of leaden souls? A genius which no chain controls Roves with delight, or deep, or high: Swift I survey the globe around, Dive to the centre thro' the solid ground, Or travel o'er the sky. TO THE REV. MR. BENONI ROWE. The Way of the Multitude. I. Rowe, if we make the crowd our guide Thro' life's uncertain road, Mean is the chase; and wandering wide We miss th'immortal good; Yet if my thoughts could be confin'd To follow any leader-mind, I'd mark thy steps, and tread the same: Drest in thy notions I'd appear Not like a soul of mortal frame, Nor with a vulgar air. II. Men live at random and by chance, Bright reason never leads the dance; Whilst in the broad and beaten way O'er dales and hills from truth we stray, To ruin we descend, to ruin we advance. Wisdom retires; she hates the crowd, And with a decent scorn Aloof she climbs her steepy seat, Where nor the grave nor giddy feet, Of the learn'd vulgar or the rude, Have e'er a passage worn. III. Mere hazard first began the track, Where custom leads her thousands blind In willing chains and strong; There's scarce one bold, one noble mind, Dares tread the fatal error back; But hand in hand ourselves we bind And drag the age along. IV. Mortals, a savage herd, and loud As billows on a noisy flood In rapid order roll: Example makes the mischief good: With jocund heel we beat the road, Unheedful of the goal. Me let Ithuriel is the name of an angel in Milton's Paradise Lost. Ithuriel's friendly wing Snatch from the crowd, and bear sublime To wisdom's lofty tower, Thence to survey that wretched thing, Mankind; and in exalted rhyme Bless the delivering power. TO THE REV. MR. JOHN HOWE. 1704. I. Great man, permit the muse to climb And seat her at thy feet, Bid her attempt a thought sublime, And consecrate her wit. I feel, I feel th'attractive force Of thy superior soul: My chariot flies her upward course, The wheels divinely roll. Now let me chide the mean affairs And mighty toil of men: How they grow grey in trifling cares, Or waste the motions of the spheres Upon delights as vain! II. A puff of honour fills the mind, And yellow dust is solid good; Thus like the ass of savage kind, We snuff the breezes of the wind, Or steal the serpent's food. Could all the choirs That charm the poles But strike one doleful sound, 'Twould be employ'd to mourn our souls, Souls that were fram'd of sprightly fires In floods of folly drown'd. Souls made of glory seek a brutal joy; How they disclaim their heav'nly birth, Melt their bright substance down with drossy earth, And hate to be refin'd from that impure alloy. III. Oft has thy genius rous'd us hence With elevated song, Bid us renounce this world of sense, Bid us divide th'immortal prize With the seraphic throng: ‘Knowledge and love make spirits blest, ‘Knowledge their food, and love their rest;’ But flesh, th'unmanageable beast, Resists the pity of thine eyes, And music of thy tongue. Then let the worms of grov'ling mind Round the short joys of earthly kind In restless windings roam; Howe hath an ample orb of soul, Where shining worlds of knowledge roll, Where love, the centre and the pole, Completes the heav'n at home. The Disappointment and Relief. I. Virtue, permit my fancy to impose Upon my better pow'rs: She casts sweet fallacies on half our woes, And gilds the gloomy hours. How could we bear this tedious round Of waning moons, and rolling years, Of flaming hopes, and chilling fears, If, where no sov'reign cure appears, No opiates could be found. II. Love, the most cordial stream that flows, Is a deceitful good: Young Doris who nor guilt nor danger knows, On the green margin stood, Pleas'd with the golden bubbles as they rose, And with more golden sands her fancy pav'd the flood: Then fond to be entirely blest, And tempted by a faithless youth, As void of goodness as of truth, She plunges in with heedless haste, And rears the nether mud: Darkness and nauseous dregs arise O'er thy fair current, love, with large supplies Of pain to tieze the heart, and sorrow for the eyes. The golden bliss that charm'd her sight Is dash'd, and drown'd, and lost; A spark, or glimm'ring streak at most Shines here and there, amidst the night, Amidst the turbid waves, and gives a faint delight. III. Recover'd from the sad surprise, Doris awakes at last, Grown by the disappointment wise; And manages with art th'unlucky cast; When the lowring frown she spies On her haughty tyrant's brow, With humble love she meets his wrathful eyes, And makes her sov'reign beauty bow; Cheerful she smiles upon the grizly form; So shines the setting sun on adverse skies, And paints a rainbow on the storm. Anon she lets the sullen humour spend, And with a virtuous book or friend, Beguiles th'uneasy hours: Well-colouring ev'ry cross she meets, With heart serene she sleeps and eats, She spreads her board with fancy'd sweets, And strews her bed with flow'rs. The Hero's School of Morality. Thereon, amongst his travels, found, A broken statue on the ground; And searching onward, as he went He trac'd a ruin'd monument. Mould, moss, and shades had overgrown The sculpture of the crumbling stone, Yet, ere he past, with much ado, He guess'd, and spell'd out, Sci-pi-o. ‘Enough,’ he cry'd, ‘I'll drudge no more ‘In tuning the dull Stoics o'er: ‘Let pedants waste their hours of ease ‘To sweat all night at Socrates; ‘And feed their boys with notes and rules ‘Those tedious recipes of schools, ‘To cure ambition: I can learn ‘With greater ease the great concern ‘Of mortals; how we may despise ‘All the gay things below the skies. ‘Methinks a mould'ring pyramid ‘Says all that the old sages said; ‘For me these shatter'd tombs contain ‘More morals than the Vatican. ‘The dust of heroes cast abroad, ‘And kick'd and trampled in the road, ‘The relics of a lofty mind, ‘That lately wars and crowns design'd, ‘Tost for a jest from wind to wind, ‘Bid me be humble, and forbear ‘Tall monuments of fame to rear, ‘They are but castles in the air. ‘The tow'ring heights, and frightful falls, ‘The ruin'd heaps and funerals, ‘Of smoking kingdoms and their kings, ‘Tell me a thousand mournful things ‘In melancholy silence— ‘—He ‘That living could not bear to see ‘An equal, now lies torn and dead; ‘Here his pale trunk, and there his head; ‘Great Pompey! while I meditate, ‘With solemn horror, thy sad fate, ‘Thy carcase, scatter'd on the shore ‘Without a name, instructs me more ‘Than my whole library before. ‘Lie still, my Plutarch, then, and sleep, ‘And my good Seneca may keep ‘Your volumes clos'd for ever too, ‘I have no further use for you: ‘For when I feel my virtue fail, ‘And my ambitious thoughts prevail, ‘I'll take a turn among the tombs, ‘And see whereto all glory comes: ‘There the vile foot of every clown ‘Tramples the sons of honour down. ‘Beggars with awful ashes sport, ‘And tread the Cæsars in the dirt.’ Freedom. 1697. I. Tempt me no more. My soul can ne'er comport With the gay slaveries of a court: I've an aversion to those charms, And hug dear Liberty in both mine arms. Go, vassal-souls, go, cringe and wait, And dance attendance at Honorio's gate, Then run in troops before him to compose his state; Move as he moves: And when he loiters, stand; You're but the shadows of a man. Bend when he speaks; and kiss the ground: Go, catch th'impertinence of sound: Adore the follies of the great; Wait till he smiles: But lo, the idol frown'd And drove them to their fate. II. Thus base-born minds: But as for me, I can and will be free: Like a strong mountain, or some stately tree, My soul grows firm upright, And as I stand, and as I go, It keeps my body so; No, I can never part with my creation right. Let slaves and asses stoop and bow, I cannot make this iron knee Bend to a meaner pow'r than that which form'd it free. III. Thus my bold harp profusely play'd Pindarical; then on a branchy shade I hung my harp aloft, myself beneath it laid. Nature, that listen'd to my strain, Resum'd the theme, and acted it again. Sudden rose a whirling wind Swelling like Honorio proud, Around the straws and feathers crowd, Types of a slavish mind; Upwards the stormy forces rise, The dust flies up and climbs the skies, And as the tempest fell th'obedient vapours sunk: Again it roars with bellowing sound, The meaner plants that grew around, The willow, and the asp, trembled and kiss'd the ground: Hard by there stood the iron trunk Of an old oak, and all the storms defy'd; In vain the winds their forces try'd, In vain they roar'd; the iron oak Bow'd only to the heav'nly thunder's stroke. On Mr. Locke's Annotations upon several Parts of the New Testament, left behind him at his Death. I. Thus reason learns by slow degrees, What faith reveals; but still complains Of intellectual pains, And darkness from the too exuberant light. The blaze of those bright mysteries Pour'd all at once on nature's eyes Offend and cloud her feeble sight. II. Reason could scarce sustain to see Th'Almighty One, th'eternal Three, Or bear the infant deity; Scarce could her pride descend to own Her Maker stooping from his throne, And drest in glories so unknown. A ransom'd world, a bleeding God, And heav'n appeas'd with flowing blood, Were themes too painful to be understood. III. Faith, thou bright cherub, speak, and say Did ever mind of mortal race Cost thee more toil, or larger grace, To melt and bend it to obey. Twas hard to make so rich a soul submit, And lay her shining honours at thy sovereign feet. IV. Sister of faith, fair Charity, Show me the wondrous man on high, Tell how he sees the godhead Three in One; The bright conviction fills his eye, His noblest powers in deep prostration lie At the mysterious throne. ‘Forgive,’ he cries, ‘ye saints below, ‘The wav'ring and the cold assent ‘I gave to themes divinely true; ‘Can you admit the blessed to repent? ‘Eternal darkness veil the lines ‘Of that unhappy book, ‘Where glimmering reason with false lustre shines. ‘Where the mere mortal pen mistook ‘What the celestial meant! See Mr. Locke's Annotations on Rom. iii. 25. and Paraphrase on Rom. ix. 5. which has inclined some readers to doubt whether he believed the deity and satisfaction of Christ. Therefore in the fourth stanza I invoke Charity, that by her help I may find him out in heaven, since his Notes on 2 Cor. v. ult. and some other places, give me reason to believe he was no Socinian, though he has darkened the glory of the gospel, and debased christianity, in the book which he calls the Reasonableness of it, and in some of his other works. True Riches. I am not concern'd to know What to-morrow fate will do: 'Tis enough that I can say, I've possest myself to-day: Then if haply midnight-death Seize my flesh, and stop my breath, Yet to-morrow I shall be Heir to the best part of me. Glitt'ring stones, and golden things, Wealth and honours that have wings, Ever fluttering to be gone I could never call my own: Riches that the world bestows, She can take, and I can lose; But the treasures that are mine Lie afar beyond her line. When I view my spacious soul, And survey myself awhole, And enjoy myself alone, I'm a kingdom of my own. I've a mighty part within That the world hath never seen, Rich as Eden's happy ground, And with choicer plenty crown'd: Here on all the shining boughs Knowledge fair and useful grows; On the same young flow'ry tree All the seasons you may see; Notions in the bloom of light, Just disclosing to the sight; Here are thoughts of larger growth, Rip'ning into solid truth; Fruits refin'd, of noble taste; Seraphs feed on such repast. Here in a green and shady grove, Streams of pleasure mix with love: There beneath the smiling skies Hills of contemplation rise; Now upon some shining top Angels light, and call me up; I rejoice to raise my feet, Both rejoice when there we meet. There are endless beauties more Earth hath no resemblance for; Nothing like them round the pole, Nothing can describe the soul: 'Tis a region half unknown, That has treasures of its own. More remote from public view Than the bowels of Peru; Broader 'tis, and brighter far, Than the golden Indies are; Ships that trace the wat'ry stage Cannot coast it in an age; Harts, or horses, strong and fleet, Had they wings to help their feet, Could not run it half-way o'er In ten thousand days or more. Yet the silly wand'ring mind, Loth to be too much confin'd, Roves and takes her daily tours, Coasting round the narrow shores, Narrow shores of flesh and sense, Picking shells and pebbles thence: Or she sits at fancy's door, Calling shapes and shadows to her, Foreign visits still receiving, And t'herself a stranger living. Never, never would she buy Indian dust, or Tyrian dye, Never trade abroad for more, If she saw her native store, If her inward worth were known She might ever live alone. The Adventurous Muse. I Urania takes her morning flight With an inimitable wing: Thro' rising deluges of dawning light She cleaves her wondrous way, She tunes immortal anthems to the growing day; Nor A French critic. Rapin gives her rules to fly, nor An English master of music. Purcell notes to sing. II. She nor inquires, nor knows, nor fears Where lie the pointed rocks, or where th'ingulphing sand, Climbing the liquid mountains of the skies, She meets descending angels as she flies, Nor asks them where their country lies, Or where the sea-marks stand. Touch'd with an empyreal ray She springs, unerring, upward to eternal day, Spreads her white sails aloft, and steers, With bold and safe attempt, to the celestial land. III. Whilst little skiffs along the mortal shores With humble toil in order creep, Coasting in sight of one another's oars, Nor venture thro' the boundless deep. Such low pretending souls are they Who dwell inclos'd in solid orbs of scull; Plodding along their sober way, The snail o'ertakes them in their wildest play, While the poor labourers sweat to be correctly dull. IV. Give me the chariot whose diviner wheels Mark their own rout, and unconfin'd Bound o'er the everlasting hills And lose the clouds below, and leave the stars behind. Give me the muse whose gen'rous force, Impatient of the reins, Pursues an unattempted course, Breaks all the critics' iron chains, And bears to paradise the raptur'd mind. V. There Milton dwells: The mortal sung Themes not presum'd by mortal tongue; New terrors, or new glories, shine In every page, and flying scenes divine Surprise the wond'ring sense, and draw our souls along. Behold his muse sent out t'explore The unapparent deep where waves of Chaos roar, And realms of night unknown before. She trac'd a glorious path unknown, Thro' fields of heav'nly war, and seraphs overthrown, Where his advent'rous genius led: Sov'reign she fram'd a model of her own, Nor thank'd the living nor the dead. The noble hater of degenerate rhyme Shook off the chains, and built his verse sublime, A monument too high for coupled sound to climb. He mourn'd the garden lost below; (Earth is the scene for tuneful woe) Now bliss beats high in all his veins, Now the lost Eden he regains, Keeps his own air, and triumphs in unrival'd strains. VI. Immortal bard! Thus thy own Raphael sings, And knows no rule but native fire: All heav'n sits silent, while to his sov'reign strings He talks unutterable things; With graces infinite his untaught fingers rove Across the golden lyre: From ev'ry note devotion springs. Rapture, and harmony, and love, O'erspread the list'ning choir. TO MR. NICHOLAS CLARK. The Complaint. I 'Twas in a vale where osiers grow By murm'ring streams we told our woe, And mingled all our cares: Friendship sat pleas'd in both our eyes, In both the weeping dews arise, And drop alternate tears. II The vigorous monarch of the day Now mounting half his morning way Shone with a fainter bright: Still sick'ning, and decaying still, Dimly he wander'd up the hill, With his expiring light. III In dark eclipse his chariot roll'd, The queen of night obscur'd his gold Behind her sable wheels; Nature grew sad to lose the day The flow'ry vales in mourning lay, In mourning stood the hills. IV Such are our sorrows, Clark, I cry'd, Clouds of the brain grow black, and hide Our dark'ned souls behind: In the young morning of our years Distempering fogs have climb'd the spheres, And choke the lab'ring mind. V Lo, the gay planet rears his head, And overlooks the lofty shade, New bright'ning all the skies: But say, dear partner of my moan, When will our long eclipse be gone, Or when our suns arise? VI In vain are potent herbs apply'd Harmonious sounds in vain have try'd To make the darkness fly; But drugs would raise the dead as soon, Or clatt'ring brass relieve the moon, When fainting in the sky. VII Some friendly spirit from above, Born of the light, and nurst with love, Assist our feebler fires; Force these invading glooms away; Souls should be seen quite thro' their clay, Bright as your heav'nly choirs. VIII But if the fogs must damp the flame, Gently, kind death, dissolve our frame, Release the pris'ner-mind: Our souls shall mount, at thy discharge, To their bright source, and shine at large Nor clouded, nor confin'd. The Afflictions of a Friend. 1702. I Now let my cares all bury'd lie, My griefs for ever dumb: Your sorrows swell my heart so high, They leave my own no room. II Sickness and pains are quite forgot, The spleen itself is gone; Plung'd in your woes I feel them not, Or feel them all in one. III Infinite grief puts sense to flight, And all the soul invades: So the broad gloom of spreading night Devours the evening shades. IV Thus am I born to be unblest! This sympathy of woe Drives my own tyrants from my breast T'admit a foreign foe. V Sorrows in long succession reign; Their iron rod I feel: Friendship has only chang'd the chain, But I'm the pris'ner still. VI Why was this life for misery made? Or why drawn out so long? Is there no room amongst the dead? Or is a wretch too young? VII Move faster on, great nature's wheel, Be kind, ye rolling pow'rs, Hurl my days headlong down the hill With undistinguish'd hours. VIII Be dusky, all my rising suns, Nor smile upon a slave: Darkness, and death, make haste at once To hide me in the grave. The Reverse; or, the Comforts of a Friend. I Thus nature tun'd her mournful tongue, Till grace lift up her head, Revers'd the sorrow and the song, And smiling, thus she said: II ‘Were kindred spirits born for cares? ‘Must ev'ry grief be mine? ‘Is there a sympathy in tears, ‘Yet joys refuse to join?’ III Forbid it, heav'n, and raise my love. And make our joys the same: So bliss and friendship join'd above Mix an immortal flame. IV Sorrows are lost in vast delight That brightens all the soul; As deluges of dawning light O'erwhelm the dusky pole. V Pleasures in long succession reign, And all my pow'rs employ: Friendship but shifts the pleasing scene, And fresh repeats the joy. VI Life has a soft and silver thread, Nor is it drawn too long; Yet when my vaster hopes persuade, I'm willing to be gone. VII Fast as ye please roll down the hill, And haste away, my years; Or I can wait my Father's will, And dwell beneath the spheres. VIII Rise glorious, every future sun, Gild all my following days, But make the last dear moment known By well-distinguish'd rays. TO THE RIGHT HON. JOHN LORD CUTS, At the Siege of Namur. The Hardy Soldier. I ‘O why is man so thoughtless grown? ‘Why guilty souls in haste to die? ‘Vent'ring the leap to worlds unknown, ‘Heedless to arms and blood they fly. II ‘Are lives but worth a soldier's pay? ‘Why will ye join such wide extremes, ‘And stake immortal souls, in play ‘At desp'rate chance, and bloody games! III ‘Valour's a nobler turn of thought, ‘Whose pardon'd guilt forbids her fears: ‘Calmly she meets the deadly shot, ‘Secure of life above the stars. IV ‘But frenzy dares eternal fate, ‘And spurr'd with honour's airy dreams, ‘Flies to attack th'infernal gate, ‘And force a passage to the flames.’ V Thus hov'ring o'er Namuria's plains, Sung heav'nly love in Gabriel's form: Young Thraso left the moving strains, And vow'd to pray before the storm. VI Anon the thund'ring trumpet calls: ‘Vows are but wind,’ the hero cries; Then swears by heav'n, and scales the walls, Drops in the ditch, despairs and dies. Burning several Poems of Ovid, Martial, Oldham, Dryden, &amp;c. 1708. I. I judge the muse of lewd desire; Her sons to darkness, and her works to fire. In vain the flatteries of their wit Now with a melting strain, now with an heav'nly flight, Would tempt my virtue to approve Those gaudy tinders of a lawless love. So harlots dress: They can appear Sweet, modest, cool, divinely fair, To charm a Cato's eye; but all within, Stench, impudence and fire, and ugly raging sin. II. Die, Flora, die in endless shame, Thou prostitute of blackest fame, Stript of thy false array. Ovid, and all ye wilder pens Of modern lust, who gild our scenes, Poison the British stage, and paint damnation gay, Attend your mistress to the dead; When Flora dies, her imps should wait upon her shade. III. Earl of Rochester.Strephon, of noble blood and mind, (For ever shine his name!) As death approach'd, his soul refin'd, And gave his looser sonnets to the flame. ‘Burn, burn,’ he cry'd with sacred rage, ‘Hell is the due of ev'ry page, ‘Hell be the fate. (But O indulgent heaven! ‘So vile the muse, and yet the man forgiv'n!) ‘Burn on my songs: For not the silver Thames ‘Nor Tiber with his yellow streams ‘In endless currents rolling to the main, ‘Can e'er dilute the poison, or wash out the stain.’ So Moses by divine command Forbid the leprous house to stand, When deep the fatal spot was grown, ‘Break down the timber, and dig up the stone.’ TO MRS. B. BENDISH. Against Tears. I Madam, persuade me tears are good To wash our mortal cares away; These eyes shall weep a sudden flood, And stream into a briny sea. II Or if these orbs are hard and dry, (These orbs that never use to rain) Some star direct me where to buy One sov'reign drop for all my pain. III Were both the golden Indies mine, I'd give both Indies for a tear: I'd barter all but what's divine: Nor shall I think the bargain dear. IV But tears, alas! are trifling things, They rather feed than heal our woe; From trickling eyes new sorrow springs, As weeds in rainy seasons grow. V Thus weeping urges weeping on; In vain our miseries hope relief, For one drop calls another down, Till we are drown'd in seas of grief. VI Then let these useless streams be staid, Wear native courage on your face: These vulgar things were never made For souls of a superior race. VII If 'tis a rugged path you go, And thousand foes your steps surround, Tread the thorns down, charge thro' the foe: The hardest fight is highest crown'd. Few Happy Matches. August, 1701. I Say, mighty love, and teach my song, To whom my sweetest joys belong, And who the happy pairs Whose yielding hearts and joining hands, Find blessings twisted with their bands, To soften all their cares. II Not the wild herd of nymphs and swains That thoughtless fly into the chains, As custom leads the way: If there be bliss without design, Ivies and oaks may grow and twine, And be as blest as they. III Not sordid souls of earthly mould Who drawn by kindred charms of gold To dull embraces move: So two rich mountains of Peru May rush to wealthy marriage too, And make a world of love. IV Not the mad tribe that hell inspires With wanton flame; those raging fires The purer bliss destroy: On Ætna's top let furies wed, And sheets of lightning dress the bed T'improve the burning joy. V Nor the dull pairs whose marble forms None of the melting passions warms Can mingle hearts and hands: Logs of green wood that quench the coals Are marry'd, just like Stoic souls, With osiers for their bands. VI Not minds of melancholy strain, Still silent, or that still complain, Can the dear bondage bless: As well may heav'nly consorts spring From two old lutes with ne'er a string, Or none besides the bass. VII Nor can the soft inchantments hold Two jarring souls of angry mould, The rugged and the keen: Sampson's young foxes might as well In bands of cheerful wedlock dwell, With firebands ty'd between. VIII Nor let the cruel fetters bind A gentle to a savage mind; For love abhors the sight: Loose the fierce tiger from the deer, For native rage and native fear Rise and forbid delight. IX Two kindest souls alone must meet; 'Tis friendship makes the bondage sweet, And feeds their mutual loves: Bright Venus on her rolling throne Is drawn by gentlest birds alone, And Cupids yoke the doves.

The celebrated Victory of the Poles over Osman, the Turkish Emperor, in the Dacian Battle. Translated from Casimire, b. iv. od. 4. with large Additions. Gador the old, the wealthy and the strong, Cheerful in years (nor of the heroic muse Unknowing, nor unknown) held fair possessions Where flows the fruitful Danube: Seventy springs Smil'd on his seed, and seventy harvest moons Fill'd his wide granaries with autumnal joy: Still he resum'd the toil: And fame reports, While he broke up new ground, and tir'd his plough In grassy furrows, the torn earth disclos'd Helmets, and swords (bright furniture of war Sleeping in rust) and heaps of mighty bones. The sun descending to the western deep Bid him lie down and rest; he loos'd the yoke, Yet held his wearied oxen from their food With charming numbers, and uncommon song. Go, fellow-labourers, you may rove secure, Or feed beside me; taste the greens and boughs That you have long forgot; crop the sweet herb, And graze in safety, while the victor Pole Leans on his spear, and breathes; yet still his eye Jealous and fierce. How large, old soldier, say, How fair a harvest of the slaughter'd Turks Strew'd the Moldavian fields? What mighty piles Of vast destruction, and of Thracian dead Fill and amaze my eyes? Broad bucklers lie (A vain defence) spread o'er the pathless hills, And coats of scaly steel, and hard habergeon, Deep-bruis'd and empty of Mahometan limbs. This the fierce Saracen wore, (for when a boy, I was their captive, and remind their dress:) Here the Polonians dreadful march'd along In august port, and regular array, Led on to conquest: Here the Turkish chief Presumptuous trod, and in rude order rang'd His long battalions, while his populous towns Pour'd out fresh troops perpetual, drest in arms, Horrent in mail, and gay in spangled pride. O the dire image of the bloody fight These eyes have seen, when the capacious plain Was throng'd with Dacian spears; when polish'd helms And convex gold blaz'd thick against the sun Restoring all his beams! but frowning war All gloomy, like a gather'd tempest, stood Wavering, and doubtful where to bend its fall. The storm of missive steel delay'd awhile By wise command; fledg'd arrows on the nerve; And scymiter and sabre bore the sheath Reluctant; till the hollow brazen clouds Had bellow'd from each quarter of the field Loud thunder, and disgorg'd their sulph'rous fire. Then banners wav'd, and arms were mix'd with arms; Then javelins answer'd javelins as they fled, For both fled hissing death: With adverse edge The crooked fauchions met; and hideous noise From clashing shields, thro' the long ranks of war, Clang'd horrible. A thousand iron storms Roar diverse: And in harsh confusion drown The trumpet's silver sound. O rude effort Of harmony! not all the frozen stores Of the cold North, when pour'd in rattling hail, Lash with such madness the Norwegian plains, Or so torment the ear. Scarce sounds so far The direful fragor, when some southern blast Tears from the Alps a ridge of knotty oaks Deep fang'd, and ancient tenants of the rock: The massy fragment, many a rood in length, With hideous crash, rolls down the rugged cliff Resistless, plunging in the subject lake Como, or Lugaine; th'afflicted waters roar, And various thunder all the valley fills, Such was the noise of war: The troubled air Complains aloud, and propagates the din To neighbouring regions; rocks and lofty hills Beat the impetuous echoes round the sky. Uproar, revenge, and rage, and hate appear In all their murderous forms; and flame and blood, And sweat and dust array the broad campaign In horror: Hasty feet, and sparkling eyes, And all the savage passions of the soul Engage in the warm business of the day. Here mingling hands, but with no friendly gripe, Join in the flight; and breasts in close embrace, But mortal, as the iron arms of death. Here words austere, of perilous command, And valour swift t'obey; bold feats of arms Dreadful to see, and glorious to relate, Shine thro' the field with more surprising brightness Than glittering helms or spears. What loud applause (Best meed of warlike toil) what manly shouts, And yells unmanly thro' the battle ring! And sudden wrath dies into endless fame. Long did the fate of war hang dubious. Here Stood the more num'rous Turk, the valiant Pole Fought here; more dreadful, tho' with lesser wings. But what the Dahees or the coward soul Of a Cydonian, what the fearful crowds Of base Cicilians scaping from the slaughter, Or Parthian beasts, with all their racing riders, What could they mean against th'intrepid breast Of the pursuing foe? Th'impetuous Poles Rush here, and here the Lithuanian horse Drive down upon them like a double bolt Of kindled thunder raging thro' the sky On sounding wheels; or as some mighty flood Rolls his two torrents down a dreadful steep, Precipitant, and bears along the stream, Rocks, woods and trees, with all the grazing herd, And tumbles lofty forests headlong to the plain. The bold Borussian smoking from afar Moves like a tempest in a dusky cloud, And imitates th'artillery of heaven, The lightning and the roar. Amazing scene! What showers of mortal hail, what flaky fires Burst from the darkness! while their cohorts firm Met the like thunder, and an equal storm, From hostile troops, but with a braver mind. Undaunted bosoms tempt the edge of war, And rush on the sharp point; while baleful mischiefs, Deaths, and bright dangers flew across the field Thick and continual, and a thousand souls Fled murmuring thro' their wounds. I stood aloof, For 'twas unsafe to come within the wind Of Russian banners, when with whizzing sound, Eager of glory and profuse of life, They bore down fearless on the charging foes, And drove them backward. Then the Turkish moons Wander'd in disarray. A dark eclipse Hung on the silver crescent, boding night, Long night, to all her sons: At length disrob'd The standards fell; the barbarous ensigns torn Fled with the wind, the sport of angry heav'n: And a large cloud of infantry and horse Scattering in wild disorder, spread the plain. Not noise, nor number, nor the brawny limb, Nor high-built size prevails: 'Tis courage fights, 'Tis courage conquers. So whole forests fall (A spacious ruin) by one single ax, And steel well-sharpened: So a generous pair Of young-wing'd eaglets fright a thousand doves. Vast was the slaughter, and the flow'ry green Drank deep of flowing crimson. Veteran bands Here made their last campaign. Here haughty chiefs Stretch'd on the bed of purple honour lie Supine, nor dream of battle's hard event, Oppress'd with iron slumbers, and long night. Their ghosts indignant to the nether world Fled, but attended well: For at their side Some faithful Janizaries strew'd the field, Fall'n in just ranks or wedges, lunes or squares, Firm as they stood; to the Warsovian troops A nobler toil, and triumph worth their fight. But the broad sabre and keen poll-ax flew With speedy terror thro' the feebler herd, And made rude havock and irregular spoil Amongst the vulgar bands that own'd the name Of Mahomet. The wild Arabians fled In swift affright a thousand different ways Thro' brakes and thorns, and climb'd the craggy mountains Bellowing; yet hasty fate o'ertook the cry, And Polish hunters clave the timorous deer. Thus the dire prospect distant fill'd my soul With awe; till the last relics of the war The thin Edonians, flying had disclos'd The ghastly plain: I took a nearer view. Unseemly to the sight, nor to the smell Grateful. What loads of mangled flesh and limbs (A dismal carnage!) bath'd in reeking gore Lay welt'ring on the ground; while flitting life Convuls'd the nerves still shivering, nor had lost All taste of pain! Here an old Thracian lies Deform'd with years, and scars, and groans aloud Torn with fresh wounds; but inward vitals firm Forbid the soul's remove, and chain it down By the hard laws of nature, to sustain Long torment: His wild eye-balls roll: His teeth Gnashing with anguish, chide his lingering fate, Emblazon'd armour spoke his high command Amongst their neighbouring dead; they round their lord Lay prostrate; some in flight ignobly slain, Some to the skies their faces upwards turn'd Still brave, and proud to die so near their prince. I mov'd not far, and lo, at manly length Two beauteous youths of richest Ott'man blood Extended on the field: In friendship join'd Nor fate divides them: Hardy warriors both; Both faithful; drown'd in showers of darts they fell Each with his shield spread o'er his lover's heart, In vain: For on those orbs of friendly brass Stood groves of javelins: Some, alas, too deep Where planted there, and thro' their lovely bosoms Made painful avenues for cruel death. O my dear native land, forgive the tear I dropt on their wan cheeks, when strong compassion Forc'd from my melting eyes the briny dew, And paid a sacrifice to hostile virtue. Dacia, forgive the sigh that wish'd the souls Of those fair infidels some humble place Among the blest. ‘Sleep, sleep, ye hapless pair ‘Gently,’ I cry'd, ‘worthy of better fate, ‘And better faith.’ Hard by the general lay Of Saracen descent, a grizly form Breathless, yet pride sat pale upon his front In disappointment, with a surly brow Louring in death, and vext; his rigid jaws Foaming with blood bite hard the Polish spear. In that dead visage my remembrance reads Rash Caracas: In vain the boasting slave Promis'd and sooth'd the sultan threat'ning fierce With royal suppers and triumphant fare Spread wide beneath Warsovian silk and gold; See on the naked ground all cold he lies, Beneath the damp wide cov'ring of the air, Forgetful of his word. How heaven confounds Insulting hopes! with what an awful smile Laughs at the proud, that loosen all the reins To their unbounded wishes, and leads on Their blind ambition to a shameful end! But whither am I borne? This thought of arms Fires me in vain to sing to senseless bulls What generous horse should hear. Break off, my song, My barbarous muse be still: Immortal deeds Must not be thus profan'd in rustic verse: The martial trumpet, and the following age, And growing fame, shall loud rehearse the fight In sounds of glory. Lo, the evening-star Shines o'er the western hill: My oxen, come, The well-known star invites the labourer home. The Indian Philosopher. September 3, 1701. TO MR. HENRY BENDISH August 24, 1705. I Why should our joys transform to pain? Why gentle Hymen's silken chain A plague of iron prove? Bendish, 'tis strange the charm that binds Millions of hands, should leave their minds At such a loose from love. II In vain I sought the wondrous cause, Rang'd the wide fields of nature's laws, And urg'd the schools in vain; Then deep in thought, within my breast My soul retir'd, and slumber dress'd A bright instructive scene. III O'er the broad lands, and cross the tide, On fancy's airy horse I ride, (Sweet rapture of the mind!) Till on the banks of Ganges' flood, In a tall ancient grove I stood For sacred use design'd. IV Hard by, a venerable priest, Ris'n with his god, the sun, from rest, Awoke his morning song; Thrice he conjur'd the murmuring stream: The birth of souls was all his theme, And half divine his tongue. V He sang—‘Th'eternal rolling flame, ‘That vital mass, that still the same ‘Does all our minds compose: ‘But shap'd in twice ten thousand frames; ‘Thence diff'ring souls of diff'ring names, ‘And jarring tempests rose. VI ‘The mighty power that form'd the mind ‘One mould for every two design'd, ‘And bless the new-born pair: ‘This be a match for this:’ He said, ‘Then down he sent the souls he made, ‘To seek them bodies here: VII ‘But parting from their warm abode ‘They lost their fellows on the road, ‘And never join'd their hands: ‘Ah cruel chance, and crossing fates! ‘Our eastern souls have dropt their mates ‘On Europe's barbarous lands. VIII ‘Happy the youth that finds the bride ‘Whose birth is to his own ally'd, ‘The sweetest joy of life: ‘But oh the crowds of wretched souls ‘Fetter'd to minds of different moulds, ‘And chain'd t'eternal strife!’ IX Thus sang the wondrous Indian bard; My soul with vast attention heard, While Ganges ceas'd to flow: ‘Sure then,’ I cry'd, ‘might I but see ‘That gentle nymph that twinn'd with me, ‘I may be happy too. X ‘Some courteous angel, tell me where, ‘What distant lands this unknown fair, ‘Or distant seas detain? ‘Swift as the wheel of nature rolls ‘I'd fly, to meet, and mingle souls, ‘And wear the joyful chain.’ The happy Man. Serene as light is Myron's soul, And active as the sun, yet steady as the pole: In manly beauty shines his face; Every muse, and every grace, Makes his heart and tongue their seat, His heart profusely good, his tongue divinely sweet. Myron, the wonder of our eyes, Behold his manhood scarce begun! Behold his race of virtue run! Behold the goal of glory won! Nor fame denies the merit, nor withholds the prize; Her silver trumpets his renown proclaim: The lands where learning never flew, Which neither Rome nor Athens knew, Surly Japan and rich Peru, In barbarous songs, pronounce the British hero's name. ‘Airy bliss,’ the hero cry'd, ‘May feed the tympany of pride; ‘But healthy souls were never found ‘To live on emptiness and sound.’ Lo, at his honourable feet Fame's bright attendant, wealth, appears; She comes to pay obedience meet, Providing joys for future years; Blessings with lavish hand she pours Gather'd from the Indian coast: Not Danäe's lap could equal treasures boast, When Jove came down in golden show'rs. He look'd and turn'd his eyes away, With high disdain I heard him say, ‘Bliss is not made of glitt'ring clay.’ Now pomp and grandeur court his head With scutcheons, arms, and ensigns spread: Gay magnificence and state, Guards and chariots, at his gate, And slaves in endless order round his table wait: They learn the dictates of his eyes, And now they fall, and now they rise, Watch every motion of their Lord, Hang on his lips with most impatient zeal, With swift ambition seize th'unfinish'd word, And the command fulfil. Tir'd with the train that grandeur brings, He dropt a tear, and pity'd kings: Then flying from the noisy throng, Seeks the diversion of a song. Music descending on a silent cloud, Tun'd all her strings with endless art; By slow degrees from soft to loud Changing she rose: The harp and flute Harmonious join, the hero to salute, And make a captive of his heart. Fruits, and rich wine, and scenes of lawless love Each with utmost luxury strove To treat their favourite best; But sounding strings, and fruits, and wine, And lawless love, in vain combine To make his virtue sleep, or lull his soul to rest. He saw the tedious round, and, with a sigh, Pronounc'd the world but vanity. ‘In crowds of pleasure still I find ‘A painful solitude of mind. ‘A vacancy within which sense can ne'er supply. ‘Hence, and be gone, ye flatt'ring snares, ‘Ye vulgar charms of eyes and ears, ‘Ye unperforming promisers! ‘Be all my baser passions dead, ‘And base desires, by nature made ‘For animals and boys: ‘Man has a relish more refin'd, ‘Souls are for social bliss design'd, ‘Give me a blessing fit to match my mind, ‘A kindred soul to double and to share my joys.’ Myrrha appear'd: Serene her soul And active as the sun, yet steady as the pole: In softer beauties shone her face; Every muse, and every grace, Made her heart and tongue their seat, Her heart profusely good; her tongue divinely sweet: Myrrha, the wonder of his eyes; His heart recoil'd with sweet surprise, With joys unknown before: His soul, dissolv'd in pleasing pain, Flow'd to his eyes, and look'd again, And could endure no more. Enough!’ th'impatient hero cries, And seiz'd her to his breast, ‘I seek no more below the skies, ‘I give my slaves the rest.’ TO DAVID POLHILL, ESQ. An Answer to an infamous Satire, called Advice to a Painter; written by a nameless Author, against King William III. of glorious Memory, 1698. SIR, When you put this satire into my hand, you gave me the occasion of employing my pen to answer so detestable a writing; which might be done much more effectually by your known zeal for the interest of his majesty, your counsels and your courage, employed in the defence of your king and country. And, since you provoked me to write, you will accept of these efforts of my loyalty to the best of kings, addressed to one of the most zealous of his subjects, by, Sir, Your most obedient servant, I. W. PART I. And must the hero, that redeem'd our land, Here in the front of vice and scandal stand? The man of wondrous soul, that scorn'd his ease, Tempting the winters, and the faithless seas, And paid an annual tribute of his life To guard his England from the Irish knife, And crush the French dragoon? Must William's name, That brightest star that gilds the wings of fame, William the brave, the pious, and the just, Adorn these gloomy scenes of tyranny and lust? Polhill, my blood boils high, my spirits flame; Can your zeal sleep! Or are your passions tame? Nor call revenge and darkness on the poet's name? Why smoke the skies not? Why no thunders roll? Nor kindling lightnings blast his guilty soul? Audacious wretch! to stab a monarch's fame, And fire his subjects with a rebel-flame; To call the painter to his black designs, To draw our guardian's face in hellish lines: Painter, beware! the monarch can be shown Under no shape but angels, or his own, Gabriel, or William, on the British throne. O! could my thought but grasp the vast design, And words with infinite ideas join, I'd rouse Appelles, from his iron sleep, And bid him trace the warrior o'er the deep: Trace him, Appelles, o'er the Belgian plain, Fierce how he climbs the mountains of the slain, Scatt'ring just vengeance thro' the red campaign. Then dash the canvas with a flying stroke, Till it be lost in clouds of fire and smoke, And say, 'Twas thus the conqueror thro' the squadrons broke. Mark him again emerging from the cloud, Far from his troops; there like a rock he stood His country's single barrier in a sea of blood. Calmly he leaves the pleasure of a throne, And his Maria weeping; whilst alone He wards the fate of nations, and provokes his own: But heav'n secures its champion; o'er the field Paint hov'ring angels; tho' they fly conceal'd, Each intercepts a death, and wears it on his shield. Now noble pencil, lead him to our isle, Mark how the skies with joyful lustre smile, Then imitate the glory; on the strand Spread half the nation, longing till he land. Wash off the blood, and take a peaceful teint, All red the warrior, white the ruler paint: Abroad a hero, and at home a saint. Throne him on high upon a shining seat, Lust and profaneness dying at his feet, While round his head the laurel and the olive meet, The crowns of war and peace; and may they blow With flow'ry blessings ever on his brow. At his right-hand pile up the English laws In sacred volumes; thence the monarch draws His wise and just commands— Rise, ye old sages of the British isle, On the fair tablet cast a reverend smile, And bless the piece; these statutes are your own, That sway the cottage, and direct the throne; People and prince are one in William's name. Their joys, their dangers, and their laws the same. Let liberty, and right, with plumes display'd, Clap their glad wings around their guardian's head, Religion o'er the rest her starry pinions spread. Religion guards him; round th'imperial queen Place waiting virtues, each of heav'nly mien; Learn their bright air, and paint it from his eyes; The just, the bold, the temperate, and the wise Dwell in his looks; majestic, but serene; Sweet, with no fondness; cheerful but not vain: Bright, without terror; great, without disdain. His soul inspires us what his lips command, And spreads his brave example thro' the land: Not so the former reigns;— Bend down his earth to each afflicted cry, Let beams of grace dart gently from his eye; But the bright treasures of his sacred breast Are too divine, too vast to be exprest: Colours must fail where words and numbers faint, And leave the hero's heart for thought alone to paint. PART II. Now, muse, pursue the satirist again, Wipe off the blots of his envenom'd pen; Hark, how he bids the servile painter draw, In monstrous shapes, the patrons of our law; At one slight dash he cancels every name From the white rolls of honesty and fame: This scribbling wretch marks all he meets for knave, Shoots sudden bolts promiscuous at the base and brave, And with unpardonable malice sheds Poison and spite on undistinguish'd heads. Painter, forbear; or if thy bolder hand Dares to attempt the villains of the land, Draw first this poet, like some baleful star, With silent influence shedding civil war; Or factious trumpeter, whose magic sound Calls off the subjects to the hostile ground, And scatters hellish feuds the nation round. These are the imps of hell, that cursed tribe That first create the plague, and then the pain describe. Draw next above, the great ones of our isle, Still from the good distinguishing the vile; Seat 'em in pomp, in grandeur, and command, Peeling the subjects with a greedy hand: Paint forth the knaves that have the nation sold, And tinge their greedy looks with sordid gold. Mark what a selfish faction undermines The pious monarch's generous designs, Spoil their own native land as vipers do, Vipers that tear their mothers bowels through. Let great Nassau, beneath a careful crown, Mournful in majesty, look gently down, Mingling soft pity with an awful frown: He grieves to see how long in vain he strove To make us blest, how vain his labours prove To save the stubborn land he condescends to love. To the Discontented and Unquiet. Imitated partly from Casimire, book iv. ode 15. Varia, there's nothing here that's free From wearisome anxiety: And the whole round of mortal joys With short possession tires and cloys: 'Tis a dull circle that we tread, Just from the window to the bed, We rise to see and to be seen, Gaze on the world awhile, and then We yawn, and stretch to sleep again. But fancy, that uneasy guest, Still holds a lodging in our breast; She finds or frames vexations still. Herself the greatest plague we feel, We take strange pleasure in our pain, And make a mountain of a grain, Assume the load, and pant and sweat Beneath th'imaginary weight. With our dear selves we live at strife, While the most constant scenes of life From peevish humours are not free; Still we affect variety: Rather than pass an easy day, We fret and chide the hours away, Grow weary of this circling sun, And vex that he should ever run The same old track; and still, and still Rise red behind yon eastern hill, And chides the moon that darts her light Thro' the same casement every night. We shift our chambers, and our homes, To dwell where trouble never comes: Silvia has left the city crowd, Against the court exclaims aloud, Flies to the woods; a hermit-saint! She loaths her patches, pins and paint, Dear diamonds from her neck are torn: But Humour, that eternal thorn, Sticks in her heart: She's hurry'd still, 'Twixt her wild passions and her will: Haunted and hagg'd where'er she roves, By purling streams, and silent groves, Or with her furies, or her loves. Then our own native land we hate, Too cold, too windy, or too wet; Change the thick climate, and repair To France or Italy for air; In vain we change, in vain we fly; Go, Silvia, mount the whirling sky, Or ride upon the feather'd wind In vain; if this diseased mind Clings fast, and still sits close behind. Faithful disease, that never fails Attendance at her lady's side, Over the desert or the tide, On rolling wheels, or flying sails. Happy the soul that virtue shows To fix the place of her repose, Needless to move; for she can dwell In her old grandsire's hall as well. Virtue that never loves to roam, But sweetly hides herself at home, And easy on a native throne Of humble turf sits gently down. Yet should tumultuous storms arise, And mingle earth and seas, and skies, Should the waves swell, and make her roll Across the line, or near the pole, Still she's at peace; for well she knows To launch the stream that duty shows, And makes her home where'er she goes. Bear her, ye seas, upon your breast, Or waft her, winds, from east to west On the soft air; she cannot find A couch so easy as her mind, Nor breathe a climate half so kind. TO JOHN HARTOPP, ESQ. (NOW SIR JOHN HARTOPP, BART.) Casimire, book i. ode 4. Imitated. Vive jucundæ metuens juventæ, &amp;c. July, 1700. I Live, my dear Hartopp, live to-day, Nor let the sun look down and say, ‘Inglorious here he lies,’ Shake off your ease, and send your name To immortality and fame, By ev'ry hour that flies. II Youth's a soft scene, but trust her not: Her airy minutes, swift as thought, Slide off the slipp'ry sphere; Moons with their months make hasty rounds, The sun has pass'd his vernal bounds, And whirls about the year. III Let folly dress in green and red, And gird her waist with flowing gold, Knit blushing roses round her head, Alas! the gaudy colours fade, The garment waxes old. Hartopp, mark the withering rose, And the pale gold how dim it shows! IV Bright and lasting bliss below Is all romance and dream; Only the joys celestial flow In an eternal stream, The pleasures that the smiling day With large right-hand bestows, Falsly her left conveys away, And shuffles in our woes. So have I seen a mother play, And cheat her silly child, She gave and took a toy away, The infant cry'd and smil'd. V Airy chance, and iron fate Hurry and vex our mortal state, And all the race of ills create; Now fiery joy, now sullen grief, Commands the reins of human life, The wheels impetuous roll; The harnest hours and minutes strive, And days with stretching pinions drive— —down fiercely on the goal. VI Not half so fast, the galley flies O'er the Venetian sea, When sails, and oars, and lab'ring skies Contend to make her way. Swift wings for all the flying hours The God of time prepares, The rest lie still yet in their nest And grow for future years. TO THOMAS GUNSTON, ESQ. 1700. Happy Solitude. Casimire, book iv. ode 12. Imitated. Quid me latentem, &amp;c. I. The noisy world complains of me That I should shun their sight, and flee Visits, and crowds, and company. Gunston, the lark dwells in her nest Till she ascend the skies; And in my closet I could rest Till to the heavens I rise. II. Yet they will urge, ‘This private life ‘Can never make you blest, ‘And twenty doors are still at strife ‘T'engage you for a guest.’ Friend, should the towers of Windsor or Whitehall Spread open their inviting gates To make my entertainment gay; I would obey the royal call, But short should be my stay, Since a diviner service waits T'employ my hours at home, and better fill the day. III. When I within myself retreat, I shut my doors against the great; My busy eye-balls inward roll, And there with large survey I see All the wide theatre of me, And view the various scenes of my retiring soul; There I walk o'er the mazes I have trod, While hope and fear are in a doubtful strife, Whether this opera of life Be acted well to gain the plaudit of my God. IV. There's a day hast'ning, 'tis an awful day! When the great Sov'reign shall at large review All that we speak, and all we do, The several parts we act on this wide stage of clay: These he approves, and those he blames, And crowns perhaps a porter, and a prince he damns. O if the Judge from his tremendous seat Shall not condemn what I have done, I shall be happy tho' unknown, Nor need the gazing rabble, nor the shouting street. V. I hate the glory, friend, that springs From vulgar breath, and empty sound; Fame mounts her upward with a flatt'ring gale Upon her airy wings, Till Envy shoots, and Fame receives the wound; Then her flagging pinions fail, Down Glory falls and strikes the ground, And breaks her batter'd limbs. Rather let me be quite concealed from Fame; How happy I should lie In sweet obscurity, Nor the loud world pronounce my little name! Here I could live and die alone; Or if society be due To keep our taste of pleasure new, Gunston, I'd live and die with you, For both our souls are one. VI. Here we could sit and pass the hour, And pity kingdoms and their kings, And smile at all their shining things, Their toys of state, and images of power; Virtue should dwell within our seat, Virtue alone could make it sweet, Nor is herself secure, but in a close retreat, While she withdraws from public praise Envy perhaps would cease to rail, Envy itself may innocently gaze At beauty in a veil: But if she once advance to light, Her charms are lost in Envy's sight, And Virtue stands the mark of universal spite. TO JOHN HARTOPP, ESQ. (NOW SIR JOHN HARTOPP, BART.) The Disdain. 1700. I. Hartopp, I love the soul that dares Tread the temptations of his years Beneath his youthful feet: Fleetwood and all thy heav'nly line Look thro' the stars, and smile divine Upon an heir so great. Young Hartopp knows this noble theme, That the wild scenes of busy life, The noise, th'amusements, and the strife Are but the visions of the night, Gay phantoms of delusive light, Or a vexatious dream. II. Flesh is the vilest and the least Ingredient of our frame: We're born to live above the beast, Or quit the manly name. Pleasures of sense we leave for boys; Be shining dust the miser's food; Let fancy feed on fame and noise, Souls must pursue diviner joys, And seize th'immortal good. TO MITIO, MY FRIEND. An Epistle. Forgive me, Mitio, that there should be any mortifying lines in the following Poems inscribed to you, so soon after your entrance into that state which was designed for the completest happiness on earth: But you will quickly discover, that the muse in the first poem only represents the shades and dark colours that melancholy throws upon love, and the social life. In the second, perhaps she indulges her own bright ideas a little. Yet if the accounts are but well balanced at last, and things set in a due light, I hope there is no ground for censure. Here you will find an attempt made to talk of one of the most important concerns of human nature in verse, and that with a solemnity becoming the argument. I have banished grimace and ridicule, that persons of the most serious character may read without offence. What was written several years ago to yourself is now permitted to entertain the world; but you may assume it to yourself as a private entertainment still, while you lie concealed behind a feigned name. [THE FIRST PART: OR,] The Mourning Piece. Life's a long tragedy: This globe the stage, Well fix'd and well adorn'd with strong machines, Gay fields, and skies, and seas: The actors many: The plot immense: A flight of dæmons sit On every sailing cloud with fatal purpose; And shoot across the scenes ten thousand arrows Perpetual and unseen, headed with pain, With sorrow, infamy, disease and death. The pointed plagues fly silent thro' the air, Nor twangs the bow, yet sure and deep the wound. Dianthe acts her little part alone, Nor wishes an associate. Lo she glides Single thro' all the storm, and more secure; Less are her dangers, and her breast receives The fewest darts. ‘But, O my lov'd Marilla, ‘My sister, once my friend,’ Dianthe cries, ‘How much art thou expos'd! Thy growing soul ‘Doubled in wedlock, multiply'd in children, ‘Stands but the broader mark for all the mischiefs ‘That rove promiscuous o'er the mortal stage: ‘Children, those dear young limbs, those tenderest pieces ‘Of your own flesh, those little other selves, ‘How they dilate the heart to wide dimensions, ‘And soften every fibre to improve ‘The mother's sad capacity of pain! ‘I mourn Fidelio too; tho' heaven has chose ‘A favourite mate for him, of all her sex ‘The pride and flower: How blest the lovely pair, ‘Beyond expression, if well-mingled loves ‘And woes well-mingled could improve our bliss! ‘Amidst the rugged cares of life behold ‘The father and the husband; flatt'ring names, ‘That spread his title, and enlarge his share ‘Of common wretchedness. He fondly hopes ‘To multiply his joys, but every hour ‘Renews the disappointment and the smart. ‘There not a wound afflicts the meanest joint ‘Of his fair partner, or her infant train, ‘(Sweet babes!) but pierces to his inmost soul. ‘Strange is thy pow'r, O love! What num'rous veins, ‘And arteries, and arms, and hands, and eyes, ‘Are link'd and fasten'd to a lover's heart, ‘By strong but secret strings! With vain attempt ‘We put the Stoic on, in vain we try ‘To break the ties of nature and of blood; ‘Those hidden threads maintain the dear communion ‘Inviolably firm: Their thrilling motions ‘Reciprocal give endless sympathy ‘In all the bitters and the sweets of life. ‘Thrice happy man, if pleasure only knew ‘These avenues of love to reach our souls, ‘And pain had never found 'em!’ Thus sang the tuneful maid, fearful to try The bold experiment. Oft Daphnis came, And oft Narcissus, rivals of her heart, Luring her eyes with trifles dipt in gold, And the gay silken bondage. Firm she stood, And bold repuls'd the bright temptation still, Nor put the chains on; dangerous to try, And hard to be dissolv'd. Yet rising tears Sat on her eye-lids, while her numbers flow'd Harmonious sorrow; and the pitying drops Stole down her cheeks, to mourn the hapless state Of mortal love. Love, thou best blessing sent To soften life, and make our iron cares Easy: But thy own cares of softer kind Give sharper wounds: They lodge too near the heart, Beat, like the pulse, perpetual, and create A strange uneasy sense, a tempting pain. Say, my companion Mitio, speak sincere, (For thou art learned now) what anxious thoughts, What kind perplexities tumultuous rise, If but the absence of a day divide Thee from thy fair beloved! Vainly smiles The cheerful sun, and night with radiant eyes Twinkles in vain: The region of thy soul Is darkness, till thy better star appear. Tell me, what toil, what torment to sustain The rolling burden of the tedious hours? The tedious hours are ages. Fancy roves Restless in fond enquiry, nor believes Charissa safe: Charissa, in whose life Thy life consists, and in her comfort thine. Fear and surmise put on a thousand forms Of dear disquietude, and round thine ears Whisper ten thousand dangers, endless woes, Till thy frame shudders at her fancy'd death; Then dies my Mitio, and his blood creeps cold Thro' every vein. Speak, does the stranger-muse Cast happy guesses at the unknown passion, Or has she fabled all? Inform me, friend, Are half thy joys sincere? Thy hopes fulfill'd, Or frustrate? Here commit thy secret griefs To faithful ears, and be they bury'd here In friendship and oblivion; lest they spoil Thy new-born pleasures with distasteful gall. Nor let thine eye too greedily drink in The frightful prospect, when untimely death Shall make wild inroads on a parent's heart, And his dear offspring to the cruel grave Are dragg'd in sad succession; while his soul Is torn away piece-meal: Thus dies the wretch A various death, and frequent, ere he quit The theatre, and make his exit final. But if his dearest half, his faithful mate Survive, and in the sweetest saddest airs Of love and grief, approach with trembling hand To close his swimming eyes, what double pangs, What racks, what twinges rend his heart-strings off From the fair bosom of that fellow-dove He leaves behind to mourn? What jealous cares Hang on his parting soul, to think his love Expos'd to wild oppression, and the herd Of savage men? So parts the dying turtle With sobbing accents, with such sad regret Leaves his kind feather'd mate: The widow bird Wanders in lonesome shades, forgets her food, Forgets her life; or falls a speedier prey To talon'd falcons, and the crooked beak Of hawks athirst for blood— THE SECOND PART: OR, The bright Vision. Thus far the muse, in unaccustom'd mood, And strains unpleasing to a lover's ear, Indulg'd a gloom of thought; and thus she sang Partial; for melancholy's hateful form Stood by in sable robe: The pensive muse Survey'd the darksome scenes of life, and sought Some bright relieving glimpse, some cordial ray In the fair world of love: But while she gaz'd Delightful on the state of twin-born souls United, bless'd, the cruel shade apply'd A dark long tube, and a false tinctur'd glass Deceitful; blending love and life at once In darkness, chaos, and the common mass Of misery: Now Urania feels the cheat, And breaks the hated optic in disdain. Swift vanishes the sullen form, and lo The scene shines bright with bliss: Behold the place Where mischiefs never fly, cares never come With wrinkled brow, nor anguish, nor disease, Nor malice forky-tongu'd. On this dear spot, Mitio, my love would fix and plant thy station, To act thy part of life, serene and blest With the fair consort fitted to thy heart. Sure 'tis a vision of that happy grove Where the first authors of our mournful race Liv'd in sweet partnership! One hour they liv'd, But chang'd the tasted bliss (imprudent pair!) For sin, and shame, and this waste wilderness Of briers, and nine hundred years of pain. The wishing muse new dresses the fair garden Amid this desart world, with budding bliss, And ever-greens, and balms, and flow'ry beauties Without one dang'rous tree; there heav'nly dews Nightly descending shall impearl the grass And verdant herbage; drops of fragrancy Sit trembling on the spires: The spicy vapours Rise with the dawn, and thro' the air diffus'd Salute your waking senses with perfume: While vital fruits with their ambrosial juice Renew life's purple flood and fountain, pure From vicious taint; and with your innocence Immortalise the structure of your clay. On this new paradise the cloudless skies Shall smile perpetual, while the lamp of day With flames unsully'd, (as the fabled torch Of Hymen) measures out your golden hours Along his azure road. The nuptial moon In milder rays serene, should nightly rise Full orb'd (if heaven and nature will indulge So fair an emblem) big with silver joys, And still forget her wane. The feather'd choir Warbling their Maker's praise on early wing, Or perch'd on evening-bough, shall join your worship, Join your sweet vespers, and the morning song. O sacred symphony! Hark, thro' the grove I hear the sound divine! I'm all attention, All ear, all ecstasy; unknown delight! And the fair muse proclaims the heav'n below. Not the seraphic minds of high degree Disdain converse with men: Again returning I see the ethereal host on downward wing. Lo, at the eastern gate young cherubs stand Guardians, commission'd to convey their joys To earthly lovers. Go, ye happy pair, Go taste their banquet, learn the nobler pleasures Supernal, and from brutal dregs refin'd. Raphael shall teach thee, friend, exalted thoughts And intellectual bliss. 'Twas Raphael taught The patriarch of our progeny the affairs Of heaven! (So Milton sings, enlight'ned bard! Nor miss'd his eyes, when in sublimest strain The angel's great narration he repeats To Albion's sons high-favour'd.) Thou shalt learn Celestial lessons from his awful tongue; And with soft grace and interwoven loves (Grateful digression) all his words rehearse To thy Charissa's ear, and charm her soul. Thus with divine discourse, in shady bowers Of Eden, our first father entertain'd Eve his sole auditress; and deep dispute With conjugal caresses on her lip Solv'd easy, and abstrusest thoughts reveal'd. Now the day wears apace, now Mitio comes From his bright tutor, and finds out his mate. Behold the dear associates seated low On humble turf, with rose and myrtle strow'd: But high their conference! How self-suffic'd Lives their eternal Maker, girt around With glories; arm'd with thunders; and his throne Mortal access forbids, projecting far Splendors unsufferable and radiant death. With reverence and abasement deep they fall Before his sovereign majesty, to pay Due worship: Then his mercy on their souls Smiles with a gentler ray, but sov'reign still; And leads their meditation and discourse Long ages backward, and across the seas To Bethlehem of Judah: There the Son, The filial godhead, character express Of brightness inexpressible, laid by His beamy robes, and made descent to earth. Sprung from the sons of Adam he became A second father, studious to regain Lost paradise for men, and purchase heav'n. The Lovers with indearment mutual thus Promiscuous talk'd, and questions intricate His manly judgment still resolv'd, and still Held her attention fix'd: She musing sat On the sweet mention of incarnate love, Till rapture wak'd her voice to softest strains. ‘She sang the Infant God; (mysterious theme) ‘How vile his birth-place, and his cradle vile! ‘The ox and ass his mean companions; there ‘Inhabit vile the shepherds flock around, ‘Saluting the great mother, and adore ‘Israel's anointed King, the appointed Heir ‘Of the creation. How debas'd he lies ‘Beneath his regal state; for thee, my Mitio, ‘Debas'd in servile form; but angels stood ‘Minist'ring round their charge with folded wings ‘Obsequious, tho' unseen; while lightsome hours ‘Fulfill'd the day, and the gray evening rose. ‘Then the fair guardians hov'ring o'er his head ‘Wakeful all night, drive the foul spirits far, And with their fanning pinions purge the air ‘From busy phantoms, from infectious damps, ‘And impure taint; while their ambrosial plumes ‘A dewy slumber on his senses shed. ‘Alternate hymns the heav'nly watchers sung ‘Melodious, soothing the surrounding shades, ‘And kept the darkness chaste and holy. Then ‘Midnight was charm'd, and all her gazing eyes ‘Wonder'd to see their mighty Maker sleep. ‘Behold the glooms disperse, the rosy morn ‘Smiles in the east with eye-lids opening fair, ‘But not so fair as thine; O I could fold thee, ‘My young Almighty, my creator-babe, ‘For ever in these arms! For ever dwell ‘Upon thy lovely form with gazing joy, ‘And every pulse should beat seraphic love! ‘Around my seat should crowding cherubs come ‘With swift ambition, zealous to attend ‘Their Prince, and form a heav'n below the sky.’ ‘Forbear, Charissa, O forbear the thought ‘Of female-fondness, and forgive the man ‘That interrupts such melting harmony!’ Thus Mitio; and awakes her nobler powers To pay just worship to the sacred King, Jesus, the God; nor with devotion pure Mix the caresses of her softer sex; (Vain blandishment) ‘Come, turn thine eyes aside ‘From Bethle'em, and climb up the doleful steep ‘Of bloody Calvary, where naked sculls ‘Pave the sad road, and fright the traveller. ‘Can my beloved bear to trace the feet ‘Of her Redeemer panting up the hill ‘Hard-burden'd? Can thy heart attend his cross? ‘Nail'd to the cruel wood he groans, he dies, ‘For thee he dies. Beneath thy sins and mine ‘(Horrible load!) the sinful Saviour groans, ‘And in fierce anguish of his soul expires. ‘Adoring angels pry with bending head ‘Searching the deep contrivance, and admire ‘This infinite design. Here peace is made ‘'Twixt God the Sov'reign, and the rebel man: ‘Here Satan overthrown with all his hosts ‘In second ruin rages and despairs; ‘Malice itself despairs. The captive prey ‘Long held in slavery hopes a sweet release, ‘And Adam's ruin'd offspring shall revive ‘Thus ransom'd from the greedy jaws of death.’ The fair disciple heard; her passions move Harmonious to the great discourse, and breathe Refin'd devotion: While new smiles of love Repay her teacher. Both with bended knees Read o'er the covenant of eternal life Brought down to men; seal'd by the sacred Three In heav'n; and seal'd on earth with God's own blood, Here they unite their names again, and sign Those peaceful articles. (Hail, blest co-heirs Celestial! Ye shall grow to manly age, And spite of earth and hell, in season due Possess the fair inheritance above.) With joyous admiration they survey The gospel treasures infinite, unseen By mortal eye, by mortal ear unheard, And unconceiv'd by thought: Riches divine And honours which the Almighty Father God Pour'd with immense profusion on his Son, High-Treasurer of heaven. The Son bestows The life, the love, the blessing, and the joy On bankrupt mortals who believe and love His name. ‘Then, my Charissa, all is thine.’ ‘And thine, my Mitio,’ the fair saint replies. ‘Life, death, the world below, and worlds on high, ‘And place, and time, are ours; and things to come, ‘And past, and present; for our interest stands ‘Firm in our mystic head, the title sure. ‘'Tis for our health and sweet refreshment (while ‘We sojourn strangers here) the fruitful earth ‘Bears plenteous; and revolving seasons still ‘Dress her vast globe in various ornament. ‘For us this cheerful sun and cheerful light ‘Diurnal shine. This blue expanse of sky ‘Hangs, a rich canopy above our heads ‘Covering our slumbers, all with starry gold ‘Inwrought, when night alternates her return. ‘For us time wears his wings out: Nature keeps ‘Her wheels in motion; and her fabric stands. ‘Glories beyond our ken of mortal sight ‘Are now preparing, and a mansion fair ‘Awaits us, where the saints unbody'd live. ‘Spirits releas'd from clay, and purg'd from sin: ‘Thither our hearts with most incessant wish ‘Panting aspire; when shall that dearest hour ‘Shine and release us hence, and bear us high, ‘Bear us at once unsever'd to our better home?’ O blest connubial state! O happy pair, Envy'd by yet unsociated souls Who seek their faithful twins! Your pleasures rise Sweet as the morn, advancing as the day, Fervent as glorious noon, serenely calm As summer evenings. The vile sons of earth Grov'ling in dust with all their noisy jars Restless, shall interrupt your joys no more Than barking animals affright the moon Sublime, and riding in her midnight way. Friendship and love shall undistinguish'd reign O'er all your passions with unrival'd sway Mutual and everlasting: Friendship knows No property in good, but all things common That each possesses, as the light or air In which we breathe and live: There's not one thought Can lurk in close reserve, no barriers fix'd, But every passage open as the day To one another's breast, and inmost mind. Thus by communion your delight shall grow, Thus streams of mingled bliss swell higher as they flow, Thus angels mix their flames, and more divinely grow. THE THIRD PART: OR, The Account balanced. I. Should sov'reign love before me stand, With all his train of pomp and state, And bid the daring muse relate His comforts and his cares; Mitio, I would not ask the sand For metaphors t'express their weight, Nor borrow numbers from the stars. Thy cares and comforts, sov'reign love, Vastly out-weigh the sand below, And to a larger audit grow Than all the stars above. Thy mighty losses and thy gains Are their own mutual measures; Only the man that knows thy pains Can reckon up thy pleasures. II. Say, Damon, say, how bright the scene, Damon is half-divinely blest, Leaning his head on his Florella's breast, Without a jealous thought, or busy care between: Then the sweet passions mix and share; Florella tells thee all her heart, Nor can thy soul's remotest part Conceal a thought or wish from the beloved fair. Say, what a pitch thy pleasures fly, When friendship all-sincere grows up to ecstasy Nor self contracts the bliss, nor vice pollutes the joy, While thy dear offspring round thee sit, Or sporting innocently at thy feet Thy kindest thoughts engage: Those little images of thee. What pretty toys of youth they be, And growing props of age! III. But short is earthly bliss! The changing wind Blows from the sickly south, and brings Malignant fevers on its sultry wings. Relentless death sits close behind: Now gasping infants, and a wife in tears, With piercing groans salutes his ears, Thro' every vein the thrilling torments roll: While sweet and bitter are at strife In those dear miseries of life, Those tenderest pieces of his bleeding soul. The pleasing sense of love awhile Mixt with the heart-ache may the pain beguile, And make a feeble fight: Till sorrows like a gloomy deluge rise, Then every smiling passion dies, And hope alone with wakeful eyes Darkling and solitary waits the slow-returning light. IV. Here then let my ambition rest, May I be moderately blest When I the laws of love obey: Let but my pleasure and my pain In equal balance ever reign, Or mount by turns and sink again, And share just measures of alternate sway. So Damon lives, and ne'er complains; Scarce can we hope diviner scenes On this dull stage of clay: The tribes beneath the northern bear Submit to darkness half the year, Since half the year is day. ON THE DEATH OF THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER, Just after Mr. Dryden. 1700. An Epigram. Dryden is dead, Dryden alone could sing The full-grown glories of a future king. Now Glo'ster dies: Thus lesser heroes live By that immortal breath that poets give; And scarce survive the muse: But William stands, Nor asks his honours from the poet's hands. William shall shine without a Dryden's praise, His laurels are not grafted on the bays. AN EPIGRAM OF MARTIAL TO CIRINUS. INSCRIBED TO MR. JOSIAH HORT. NOW LORD BISHOP OF KILMORE IN IRELAND. Sic tua, Cirini, promas Epigrammata vulgo ut mecum possis, &amp;c. 1694. So smooth your numbers, Friend, your verse so sweet, So sharp the jest, and yet the turn so neat, That with her Martial Rome would place Cirine, Rome would prefer your sense and thought to mine. Yet modest you decline the public stage, To fix your friend alone amidst the applauding age. So Maro did; the mighty Maro sings In vast heroic notes of vast heroic things, And leaves the Ode to dance upon his Flaccus strings. He scorn'd to daunt the dear Horatian lyre, Tho' his brave genius flash'd Pindaric fire, And at his will could silence all the lyric quire. So to his Varius he resign'd the praise Of the proud buskin and the tragic bays, When he could thunder with a loftier vein, And sing of gods and heroes in a bolder strain. A handsome treat, a piece of gold, or so, And compliments will every friend bestow; Rarely a Virgil, a Cirine we meet, Who lays his laurels at inferior feet, And yields the tenderest point of honour, wit. TO MRS. SINGER. (NOW MRS. ROWE.) On the Sight of some of her divine Poems, never printed. July 19, 1706. I. On the fair banks of gentle Thames I tun'd my harp; nor did celestial themes Refuse to dance upon my strings: There beneath the evening sky I sung my cares asleep, and rais'd my wishes high To everlasting things. Sudden from Albion's western coast Harmonious notes come gliding by, The neighb'ring shepherds knew the silver sound; ‘'Tis Philomela's voice,’ the neighb'ring shepherds cry; At once my strings all silent lie, At once my fainting muse was lost, In the superior sweetness drown'd. In vain I bid my tuneful powers unite; My soul retir'd, and left my tongue, I was all ear, and Philomela's song Was all divine delight. II. Now be my harp for ever dumb, My muse attempt no more. 'Twas long ago I bid adieu to mortal things, To Grecian tales, and wars of Rome, 'Twas long ago I broke all but th'immortal strings; Now those immortal strings have no employ, Since a fair angel dwells below, To tune the notes of heaven, and propagate the joy. Let all my powers with awe profound While Philomela sings, Attend the rapture of the sound, And my devotion rise on her seraphic wings. END OF THE SECOND BOOK. BOOK III. SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF THE DEAD. AN EPITAPH ON KING WILLIAM III. OF GLORIOUS MEMORY, Who died March the 8th, 1701–2. I Beneath these honours of a tomb, Greatness in humble ruin lies: (How earth confines in narrow room What heroes leave beneath the skies!) II Preserve, O venerable pile, Inviolate thy sacred trust; To thy cold arms the British isle, Weeping commits her richest dust. III Ye gentlest ministers of fate, Attend the monarch as he lies, And bid the softest slumbers wait With silken cords to bind his eyes. IV Rest his dear sword beneath his head; Round him his faithful arms shall stand: Fix his bright ensigns on his bed, The guards and honours of our land. V Ye sister-arts of Paint and Verse, Place Albion fainting by his side, Her groans arising o'er the hearse, And Belgia sinking when he dy'd. VI High o'er the grave Religion set In solemn gold; pronounce the ground Sacred, to bar unhallowed feet, And plant her guardian Virtues round. VII Fair Liberty in sables drest, Write his lov'd name upon his urn, ‘William, the scourge of tyrants past, ‘And awe of princes yet unborn.’ VIII Sweet Peace his sacred relics keep, With olives blooming round her head, And stretch her wings across the deep To bless the nations with the shade. IX Stand on the pile, immortal Fame, Broad stars adorn thy brightest robe, Thy thousand voices sound his name In silver accents round the globe. X Flattery shall faint beneath the sound, While hoary truth inspires the song; Envy grow pale and bite the ground, And slander gnaw her forky tongue. XI Night and the grave remove your gloom; Darkness becomes the vulgar dead; But glory bids the royal tomb Disdain the horrors of a shade. XII Glory with all her lamps shall burn, And watch the warrior's sleeping clay, Till the last trumpet rouse his urn To aid the triumphs of the day. ON THE SUDDEN DEATH OF MRS. MARY PEACOCK. An Elegiac Song, sent in a Letter of Condolence to Mr. N. P. Merchant, at Amsterdam. I Hark! She bids all her friends adieu; Some angel calls her to the spheres; Our eyes the radiant saint pursue Thro' liquid telescopes of tears. II Farewell, bright soul, a short farewell, Till we shall meet again above In the sweet groves where pleasures dwell, And trees of life bear fruits of love: III There glory sits on every face, There friendship smiles in every eye, There shall our tongues relate the grace That led us homeward to the sky. IV O'er all the names of Christ our King Shall our harmonious voices rove, Our harps shall sound from ev'ry string The wonders of his bleeding love. V Come, sov'reign Lord, dear Saviour, come, Remove these separating days, Send thy bright wheels to fetch us home; That golden hour, how long it stays! VI How long must we lie ling'ring here, While saints around us take their flight? Smiling, they quit this dusky sphere, And mount the hills of heav'nly light. VII Sweet soul, we leave thee to thy rest, Enjoy thy Jesus and thy God, Till we, from bands of clay releast, Spring out and climb the shining road. VIII While the dear dust she leaves behind Sleeps in thy bosom, sacred tomb! Soft be her bed, her slumbers kind, And all her dreams of joy to come. AN ELEGIAC THOUGHT ON MRS. ANNE WARNER, Who died of the Small-pox, Dec. 18, 1707, at one o'Clock in the Morning, a few Days after the Birth and Death of her first Child. Awake, my muse, range the wide world of souls, And seek Vernera fled; with upward aim Direct thy wing; for she was born from heaven, Fulfill'd her visit, and return'd on high. The midnight watch of angels that patrole The British sky, have notic'd her ascent Near the meridian star; pursue the track To the bright confines of immortal day And Paradise, her home. Say, my Urania, (For nothing 'scapes thy search, nor can'st thou miss So fair a spirit) say, beneath what shade Of amarant, or cheerful ever-green She sits, recounting to her kindred minds Angelic or humane, her mortal toil And travels thro' this howling wilderness; By what divine protections she escap'd Those deadly snares when youth and Satan leagu'd In combination to assail her virtue; (Snares set to murder souls) but heav'n secur'd The favourite nymph, and taught her victory. Or does she seek, or has she found her babe Amongst the infant nation of the blest, And clasp'd it to her soul, to satiate there The young maternal passion, and absolve The unfulfill'd embrace? Thrice happy child! That saw the light, and turn'd its eyes aside From our dim regions to th'eternal sun, And led the parent's way to glory! There Thou art for ever hers, with powers enlarg'd For love reciprocal and sweet converse. Behold her ancestors (a pious race) Rang'd in fair order, at her sight rejoice And sing her welcome. She along their seats Gliding salutes them all with honours due Such as are paid in heav'n: And last she finds A mansion fashion'd of distinguish'd light, But vacant: ‘This,’ with sure presage she cries, ‘Awaits my father; when will he arrive? ‘How long, alas, how long! (Then calls her mate) ‘Die, thou dear partner of my mortal cares, ‘Die, and partake my bliss; we are for ever one.’ Ah me! where roves my fancy! What kind dreams Crowd with sweet violence on my waking mind! Perhaps illusions all! Inform me, muse, Chooses she rather to retire apart To recollect her dissipated pow'rs, And call her thoughts her own: So lately freed From earth's vain scenes, gay visits, gratulations, From Hymen's hurrying and tumultuous joys, And fears and pangs, fierce pangs that wrought her death. Tell me on what sublimer theme she dwells In contemplation, with unerring clue Infinite truth pursuing. (When, my soul, O when shall thy release from cumb'rous flesh Pass the great seal of heav'n? What happy hour Shall give thy thoughts a loose to soar and trace The intellectual world? Divine delight! Vernera's lov'd employ!) Perhaps she sings To some new golden harp th'almighty deeds, The names, the honours of her Saviour-God, His cross, his grave, his victory, and his crown: Oh could I imitate th'exalted notes, And mortal ears could bear them!— Or lies she now before th'eternal throne Prostrate in humble form, with deep devotion O'erwhelm'd, and self-abasement at the sight Of the uncover'd godhead face to face? Seraphic crowns pay homage at his feet, And hers amongst them, not of dimmer ore, Nor set with meaner gems: But vain ambition, And emulation vain, and fond conceit, And pride for ever banish'd flies the place, Curst pride, the dress of hell. Tell me, Urania, How her joys heighten, and her golden hours Circle in love. O stamp upon my soul Some blissful image of the fair deceas'd To call my passions and my eyes aside From the dear breathless clay, distressing sight! I look and mourn and gaze with greedy view Of melancholy fondness: Tears bedewing That form so late desir'd, so late belov'd, Now loathsome and unlovely. Base disease, That leagu'd with nature's sharpest pains, and spoil'd So sweet a structure! The impoisoning taint O'erspreads the building wrought with skill divine, And ruins the rich temple to the dust! Was this the countenance, where the world admir'd Features of wit and virtue? This the face Where love triumph'd? and beauty on these cheeks, As on a throne, beneath her radiant eyes Was seated to advantage; mild, serene, Reflecting rosy light? So sits the sun (Fair eye of heaven!) upon a crimson cloud Near the horizon, and with gentle ray Smiles lovely round the sky, till rising fogs, Portending night, with foul and heavy wing Involve the golden star, and sink him down Opprest with darkness.— On the Death of an aged and honoured Relative, Mrs. M. W. July 13, 1693. I. I know the kindred mind. 'Tis she, 'tis she; Among the heav'nly forms I see The kindred mind from fleshly bondage free; O how unlike the thing was lately seen Groaning and panting on the bed, With ghastly air, and languish'd head, Life on this side, there the dead, While the delaying flesh lay shivering between! II. Long did the earthy house restrain In toilsome slavery that ethereal guest; Prison'd her round in walls of pain, And twisted cramps and aches with her chain; Till by the weight of num'rous days opprest The earthy house began to reel, The pillars trembled, and the building fell; The captive soul became her own again: Tir'd with the sorrows and the cares, A tedious train of fourscore years, The pris'ner smil'd to be releast, She felt her fetters loose, and mounted to her rest. III. Gaze on, my soul, and let a perfect view Paint her idea all anew; Rase out those melancholy shapes of woe That hang around thy memory, and becloud it so. Come, Fancy, come, with essences refin'd, With youthful green, and spotless white; Deep be the tincture, and the colours bright T'express the beauties of a naked mind. Provide no glooms to form a shade; All things above of vary'd light are made, Nor can the heav'nly piece require a mortal aid. But if the features too divine Beyond the power of fancy shine, Conceal th'inimitable strokes behind a graceful shrine. IV. Describe the saint from head to feet, Make all the lines in just proportion meet; But let her posture be Filling a chair of high degree; Observe how near it stands to the almighty seat. Paint the new graces of her eyes; Fresh in her looks let sprightly youth arise, And joys unknown below the skies. Virtue that lives conceal'd below, And to the breast confin'd, Sits here triumphant on the brow, And breaks with radiant glories through The features of the mind. Express her passion still the same, But more divinely sweet; Love has an everlasting flame, And makes the work complete. V. The painter-muse with glancing eye Observ'd a manly spirit nigh My grandfather Mr. Thomas Watts had such acquaintance with the mathematics, painting, music, and poesy, &amp;c. as gave him considerable esteem among his contemporaries. He was commander of a ship of war 1656, and by blowing up of the ship in the Dutch war he was drowned in his youth., That death had long disjoin'd: ‘In the fair tablet they shall stand ‘United by a happier band:’ She said, and fix'd her sight, and drew the manly mind, Recount the years, my song, (a mournful round!) Since he was seen on earth no more: He fought in lower seas and drown'd; But victory and peace he found On the superior shore. There now his tuneful breath in sacred songs Employs the European and the Eastern tongues. Let th'awful truncheon and the flute, The pencil and the well-known lute, Powerful numbers, charming wit And every art and science meet, And bring their laurels to his hand, or lay them at his feet. VI. 'Tis done. What beams of glory fall (Rich varnish of immortal art) To gild the bright Original! 'Tis done. The muse has now perform'd her part. Bring down the piece, Urania, from above, And let my honour and my love Dress it with chains of gold to hang upon my heart. To the dear Memory of my honoured Friend, Thomas Gunston, Esq. who died November 11, 1700, when he had just finished his Seat at Newington. Of blasted hopes, and of short withering joys, Sing, heav'nly muse. Try thine ethereal voice In funeral numbers and a doleful song; Gunston the just, the generous and the young, Gunston the friend is dead. O empty name Of earthly bliss! 'Tis all an airy dream, All a vain thought! Our soaring fancies rise On treacherous wings! And hopes that touch the skies Drag but a longer ruin thro' the downward air, And plunge the falling joy still deeper in despair. How did our souls stand flatter'd and prepar'd To shout him welcome to the seat he rear'd! There the dear man should see his hopes complete, Smiling, and tasting ev'ry lawful sweet That peace and plenty brings, while num'rous years Circling delightful play'd around the spheres: Revolving suns should still renew his strength, And draw th'uncommon thread to an unusual length, But hasty fate thrusts her dread shears between, Cuts the young life off, and shuts up the scene. Thus airy pleasure dances in our eyes, And spreads false images in fair disguise, T'allure our souls, till just within our arms The vision dies, and all the painted charms Flee quick away from the pursuing sight, Till they are lost in shades, and mingle with the night. Muse, stretch thy wings, and thy sad journey bend To the fair Fabric that thy dying friend Built nameless: 'Twill suggest a thousand things Mournful and soft as my Urania sings. How did he lay the deep foundations strong, Marking the bounds, and rear the walls along Solid and lasting; there a numerous train Of happy Gunstons might in pleasure reign, While nations perish, and long ages run, Nations unborn, and ages unbegun: Not time itself should waste the blest estate, Nor the tenth race rebuild the ancient seat. How fond our fancies are! The founder dies Childless; his sisters weep and close his eyes, And wait upon his hearse with never-ceasing cries. Lofty and slow it moves to meet the tomb, While weighty sorrow nods on ev'ry plume; A thousand groans his dear remains convey, To his cold lodging in a bed of clay, His country's sacred tears well-watering all the way. See the dull wheels roll on the sable load; But no dear son to tread the mournful road, And fondly kind drop his young sorrows there, The father's urn bedewing with a filial tear. O had he left us one behind, to play Wanton about the painted hall, and say, ‘This was my father's,’ with impatient joy In my fond arms I'd clasp the smiling boy, And call him my young friend: But awful fate Design'd the mighty stroke as lasting as 'twas great. And must this building then, this costly frame Stand here for strangers? Must some unknown name Possess these rooms, the labours of my friend? Why were these walls rais'd for this hapless end? Why these apartments all adorn'd so gay? Why his rich fancy lavish'd thus away? Muse, view the paintings, how the hov'ring light Plays o'er the colours in a wanton flight, And mingled shades wrought in by soft degrees, Give a sweet foil to all the charming piece; But night, eternal night, hangs black around The dismal chambers of the hollow ground, And solid shades unmingled round his bed Stand hideous: Earthy fogs embrace his head, And noisome vapours glide along his face Rising perpetual. Muse, forsake the place, Flee the raw damps of the unwholesome clay, Look to his airy spacious hall, and say, ‘How has he chang'd it for a lonesome cave, ‘Confin'd and crowded in a narrow grave!’ Th'unhappy house looks desolate and mourns, And every door groans doleful as it turns; The pillars languish; and each lofty wall Stately in grief, laments the master's fall, In drops of briny dew; the fabric bears His faint resemblance, and renews my tears. Solid and square it rises from below: A noble air without a gaudy show Reigns thro' the model, and adorns the whole, Manly and plain. Such was the builder's soul. O how I love to view the stately frame, That dear memorial of the best-lov'd name! Then could I wish for some prodigious cave Vast as his seat, and silent as his grave, Where the tall shades stretch to the hideous roof, Forbid the day, and guard the sun-beams off; Thither, my willing feet, should ye be drawn At the grey twilight, and the early dawn. There sweetly sad should my soft minutes roll, Numb'ring the sorrows of my drooping soul. But these are airy thoughts! Substantial grief Grows by those objects that should yield relief; Fond of my woes I heave my eyes around, My grief from ev'ry prospect courts a wound; Views the green gardens, views the smiling skies, Still my heart sinks, and still my cares arise; My wand'ring feet round the fair mansion rove, And there to sooth my sorrows I indulge my love. Oft have I laid the awful Calvin by, And the sweet Cowley, with impatient eye To see those walls, pay the sad visit there, And drop the tribute of an hourly tear: Still I behold some melancholy scene, With many a pensive thought, and many a sigh between. Two days ago we took the evening air, I, and my grief, and my Urania there; Say, my Urania, how the western sun Broke from black clouds, and in full glory shone Gilding the roof, then dropt into the sea, And sudden night devour'd the sweet remains of day; Thus the bright youth just rear'd his shining head From obscure shades of life, and sunk among the dead. The rising sun adorn'd with all his light Smiles on these walls again: But endless night Reigns uncontrol'd where the dear Gunston lies, He's set for ever, and must never rise. Then why these beams, unseasonable star, These lightsome smiles descending from afar, To greet a mourning house? In vain the day Breaks thro' the windows with a joyful ray, And marks a shining path along the floors Bounding the evening and the morning hours; In vain it bounds 'em: While vast emptiness And hollow silence reigns thro' all the place, Nor heeds the cheerful change of nature's face. Yet nature's wheels will on without control, The sun will rise, the tuneful spheres will roll, And the two nightly bears walk round and watch the pole. See while I speak, high on her sable wheel Old Night advancing climbs the eastern hill: Troops of dark clouds prepare her way; behold, How their brown pinions edg'd with evening gold Spread shadowing o'er the house, and glide away Slowly pursuing the declining day; O'er the broad roof they fly their circuit still, Thus days before they did, and days to come they will; But the black cloud that shadows o'er his eyes, Hangs there unmoveable, and never flies: Fain would I bid the envious gloom be gone; Ah fruitless wish! How are his curtains drawn For a long evening that despairs the dawn! Muse, view the turret: Just beneath the skies Lonesome it stands, and fixes my sad eyes, As it would ask a tear. O sacred seat Sacred to friendship! O divine retreat! Here did I hope my happy hours t'employ, And fed before-hand on the promis'd joy, When weary of the noisy town, my friend From mortal cares retiring, should ascend And lead me thither. We alone wou'd sit Free and secure of all intruding feet: Our thoughts should stretch their longest wings, and rise, Nor bound their soarings by the lower skies: Our tongues should aim at everlasting themes, And speak what mortals dare, of all the names Of boundless joys and glories, thrones and seats, Built high in heaven for souls: We'd trace the streets Of golden pavement, walk each blissful field, And climb and taste the fruits the spicy mountains yield: Then would we swear to keep the sacred road, And walk right upwards to that blest abode; We'd charge our parting spirits there to meet, There hand in hand approach th'almighty seat, And bend our heads adoring at our Maker's feet. Thus should we mount on bold advent'rous wings In high discourse, and dwell on heavenly things, While the pleas'd hours in sweet succession move, And minutes measur'd, as they are above, By ever-circling joys, and ever-shining love. Anon our thoughts shou'd lower their lofty flight, Sink by degrees, and take a pleasing sight, A large round prospect of the spreading plain, The wealthy river, and his winding train, The smoky city, and the busy men. How we should smile to see degenerate worms Lavish their lives, and fight for airy forms Of painted honour, dreams of empty sound Till envy rise, and shoot a secret wound At swelling glory, straight the bubble breaks, And the scenes vanish, as the man awakes; Then the tall titles insolent and proud Sink to the dust, and mingle with the crowd. Man is a restless thing: Still vain and wild, Lives beyond sixty, nor outgrows the child: His hurrying lusts still break the sacred bound To seek new pleasures on forbidden ground, And buy them all too dear. Unthinking fool, For a short dying joy to sell a deathless soul! 'Tis but a grain of sweetness they can sow, And reap the long sad harvest of immortal woe. Another tribe toil in a different strife, And banish all the lawful sweets of life, To sweat and dig for gold, to hoard the ore, Hide the dear dust yet darker than before, And never dare to use a grain of all the store. Happy the man that knows the value just Of earthly things, nor is enslav'd to dust. 'Tis a rich gift the skies but rarely send To fav'rite souls. Then happy thou, my friend, For thou hadst learnt to manage and command The wealth that heav'n bestow'd with liberal hand: Hence this fair structure rose; and hence this seat Made to invite my not unwilling feet: In vain 'twas made! For we shall never meet, And smile, and love, and bless each other here, The envious tomb forbids thy face t'appear, Detains thee, Gunston, from my longing eyes, And all my hopes lie bury'd, where my Gunston lies. Come hither, all ye tenderest souls, that know The heights of fondness, and the depths of woe, Young mothers, who your darling babes have found Untimely murder'd with a ghastly wound; Ye frighted nymphs, who on the bridal bed Clasp'd in your arms your lovers cold and dead, Come; in the pomp of all your wild despair, With flowing eye-lids, and disorder'd hair, Death in your looks; come, mingle grief with me, And drown your little streams in my unbounded sea. You sacred mourners of a nobler mould, Born for a friend, whose dear embraces hold Beyond all nature's ties; you that have known Two happy souls made intimately one, And felt a parting stroke: 'Tis you must tell The smart, the twinges, and the racks I feel: This soul of mine that dreadful wound has borne, Off from its side its dearest half is torn, The rest lies bleeding, and but lives to mourn. O infinite distress! Such raging grief Should command pity, and despair relief. Passion, methinks, should rise from all my groans, Give sense to rocks, and sympathy to stones. Ye dusky woods and echoing hills around, Repeat my cries with a perpetual sound: Be all ye flow'ry vales with thorns o'ergrown, Assist my sorrows, and declare your own; Alas! your lord is dead. The humble plain Must ne'er receive his courteous feet again; Mourn, ye gay smiling meadows, and be seen In wintry robes, instead of youthful green; And bid the brook, that still runs warbling by, Move silent on, and weep his useless channel dry. Hither methinks the lowing herd should come, And moaning turtles murmur o'er his tomb: The oak shall wither, and the curling vine Weep his young life out, while his arms untwine Their amorous folds, and mix his bleeding soul with mine. Ye stately elms, in your long order mourn, There was a long row of tall elms then standing where some years after the lower garden was made. Strip off your pride to dress your master's urn: Here gently drop your leaves, instead of tears: Ye elms, the reverend growth of ancient years, Stand tall and naked to the blustering rage Of the mad winds: Thus it becomes your age To show your sorrows. Often ye have seen Our heads reclin'd upon the rising green; Beneath your sacred shade diffus'd we lay, Here Friendship reign'd with an unbounded sway: Hither our souls the constant off'rings brought, The burdens of the breast, and labours of the thought; Our opening bosoms on the conscious ground Spread all the sorrows and the joys we found, And mingled ev'ry care; nor was it known Which of the pains and pleasures were our own; Then with an equal hand and honest soul We share the heap, yet both possess the whole, And all the passions there thro' both our bosoms roll. By turns we comfort, and by turns complain, And bear and ease by turns the sympathy of pain. Friendship! mysterious thing, what magic pow'rs Support thy sway, and charm these minds of ours? Bound to thy foot we boast our birthright still, And dream of freedom, when we've lost our will, And chang'd away our souls: At thy command We snatch new miseries from a foreign hand, To call them ours; and, thoughtless of our ease, Plague the dear self that we were born to please. Thou tyranness of minds, whose cruel throne Heaps on poor mortals sorrows not their own; As though our mother nature could no more Find woes sufficient for each son she bore, Friendship divides the shares, and lengthens out the store. Yet are we fond of thine imperious reign, Proud of thy slavery, wanton in our pain, And chide the courteous hand when death dissolves the chain. Virtue, forgive the thought! The raving muse Wild and despairing knows not what she does, Grows mad in grief, and in her savage hours Affronts the name she loves and she adores. She is thy vot'ress too; and at thy shrine, O sacred Friendship, offer'd songs divine, While Gunston liv'd, and both our souls were thine. Here to these shades at solemn hours we came, To pay devotion with a mutual flame, Partners in bliss. Sweet luxury of the mind! And sweet the aids of sense! Each ruder wind Slept in its caverns, while an evening breeze Fann'd the leaves gently, sporting thro' the trees; The linnet and the lark their vespers sung And clouds of crimson o'er th'horizon hung; The slow-declining sun with sloping wheels Sunk down the golden day behind the western hills. Mourn, ye young gardens, ye unfinish'd gates, Ye green inclosures, and ye growing sweets Lament, for ye our midnight hours have known, And watch'd us walking by the silent moon In conference divine, while heav'nly fire Kindling our breasts did all our thoughts inspire With joys almost immortal; then our zeal Blaz'd and burnt high to reach th'ethereal hill, And love refin'd, like that above the poles, Threw both our arms round one another's souls In rapture and embraces. Oh forbear, Forbear, my song! This is too much to hear, Too dreadful to repeat; such joys as these Fled from the earth for ever!— Oh for a general grief! Let all things share Our woes, that knew our loves: The neighbouring air Let it be laden with immortal sighs, And tell the gales, that ev'ry breath that flies Over these fields should murmur and complain, And kiss the fading grass, and propagate the pain. Weep all ye buildings, and the groves around For ever weep: This is an endless wound, Vast and incurable. Ye buildings knew His silver tongue, ye groves have heard it too: At that dear sound no more shall ye rejoice, And I no more must hear the charming voice: Woe to my drooping soul! that heav'nly breath That could speak life lies now congeal'd in death; While on his folded lips all cold and pale Eternal chains and heavy silence dwell. Yet my fond hope would hear him speak again, Once more at least, one gentle word, and then Gunston aloud I call: In vain I cry Gunston aloud; for he must ne'er reply. In vain I mourn, and drop these funeral tears, Death and the grave have neither eyes nor ears: Wand'ring I tune my sorrows to the groves, And vent my swelling griefs, and tell the winds our loves; While the dear youth sleeps fast, and hears them not: He hath forgot me: In the lonesome vault Mindless of Watts and friendship, cold he lies, Deaf and unthinking clay.— But whither am I led? This artless grief Hurries the muse on, obstinate and deaf To all the nicer rules, and bears her down From the tall fabric to the neighbouring ground: The pleasing hours, the happy moments past In these sweet fields reviving on my taste Snatch me away resistless with impetuous haste. Spread thy strong pinions once again, my song, And reach the turret thou hast left so long: O'er the wide roofs its lofty head it rears, Long waiting our converse; but only hears The noisy tumults of the realms on high; The winds salute it whistling as they fly, Or jarring round the windows: Rattling showers Lash the fair sides; above loud thunder roars; But still the master sleeps; nor hears the voice Of sacred friendship, nor the tempest's noise: An iron slumber sits on every sense, In vain the heav'nly thunders strive to rouse it thence. One labour more, my muse, the golden sphere Seems to demand: See thro' the dusky air Downward it shines upon the rising moon; And, as she labours up to reach her noon, Pursues her orb with repercussive light, And streaming gold repays the paler beams of night: But not one ray can reach the darksome grave, Or pierce the solid gloom that fills the cave Where Gunston dwells in death. Behold it flames Like some new meteor with diffusive beams Thro' the mid-heaven, and overcomes the stars; ‘So shines thy Gunston's soul above the spheres,’ Raphael replies, and wipes away my tears. ‘We saw the flesh sink down with closing eyes, ‘We heard thy grief shriek out, He dies, He dies! ‘Mistaken grief! to call the flesh the friend! ‘On our fair wings did the bright youth ascend, ‘All heav'n embrac'd him with immortal love, ‘And sung his welcome to the courts above. ‘Gentle Ithuriel led him round the skies, ‘The buildings struck him with immense surprise; ‘The spires all radiant, and the mansions bright, ‘The roof high vaulted with ethereal light: ‘Beauty and strength on the tall bulwarks sat ‘In heav'nly diamond; and for every gate ‘On golden hinges a broad ruby turns, ‘Guards off the foe, and as it moves it burns; ‘Millions of glories reign thro' every part; ‘Infinite power, and uncreated art ‘Stand here display'd, and to the stranger show ‘How it outshines the noblest seats below. ‘The stranger fed his gazing pow'rs awhile ‘Transported: Then, with a regardless smile, ‘Glanc'd his eyes downward thro' the crystal floor, ‘And took eternal leave of what he built before.’ Now, fair Urania, leave the doleful strain; Raphael commands: Assume thy joys again. In everlasting numbers sing, and say, ‘Gunston has mov'd his dwelling to the realms of day; ‘Gunston the friend lives still:’ And give thy groans away. TO THE MEMORY OF THE REV. MR. THOMAS GOUGE, WHO DIED JANUARY THE 8TH, 1699–700. I. Ye virgin souls, whose sweet complaint Psalm cxxxvii. Could teach Euphrates not to flow, Lament. i. 2, 3. Could Sion's ruin so divinely paint, Array'd in beauty and in woe: Awake, ye virgin-souls, to mourn, And with your tuneful sorrows dress a prophet's urn. O could my lips or flowing eyes But imitate such charming grief, I'd teach the seas, and teach the skies Wailings, and sobs, and sympathies; Nor should the stones or rocks be deaf; Rocks shall have eyes, and stones have ears, While Gouge's death is mourn'd in melody and tears. II. Heav'n was impatient of our crimes, And sent his minister of death To scourge the bold rebellion of the times, And to demand our prophet's breath; He came commission'd for the fates Of awful Mead, and charming Bates; There he essay'd the vengeance first, Then took a dismal aim, and brought great Gouge to dust. III. Great Gouge to dust! How doleful is the sound! How vast the stroke is! and how wide the wound! Oh painful stroke! distressing death A wound unmeasurably wide! No vulgar mortal dy'd When he resign'd his breath. The muse that mourns a nation's fall, Should wait at Gouge's funeral, Should mingle majesty and groans, Such as she sings to sinking thrones, And in deep-sounding numbers tell, How Sion trembled, when this pillar fell. Sion grows weak, and England poor, Nature herself, with all her store, Can furnish such a pomp for death no more. IV. The reverend man let all things mourn; Sure he was some æthereal mind, Fated in flesh to be confin'd, And order'd to be born. His soul was of th'angelic frame, The same ingredients, and the mould the same, When the Creator makes a minister of flame. He was all form'd of heav'nly things. Mortals, believe what my Urania sings, For she has seen him rise upon his flamy wings. V. How would he mount, how would he fly Up thro' the ocean of the sky, Tow'rd the celestial coast! With what amazing swiftness soar, Till earth's dark ball was seen no more, And all its mountains lost! Scarce could the muse pursue him with her sight: But, angels, you can tell, For oft you meet his wondrous flight, And knew the stranger well; Say, how he past the radiant spheres And visited your happy seats, And trac'd the well-known turnings of the golden streets, And walk'd among the stars. VI. Tell how he climb'd the everlasting hills, Surveying all the realms above, Borne on a strong-wing'd faith, and on the fiery wheels Of an immortal love. 'Twas there he took a glorious sight Of the inheritance of saints in light, And read their title in their Saviour's right. How oft the humble scholar came, And to your songs he rais'd his ears To learn th'unutterable name, To view th'eternal base that bears The new creation's frame. The countenance of God he saw, Full of mercy, full of awe, The glories of his power, and glories of his grace: There he beheld the wondrous springs Of those celestial sacred things, The peaceful gospel and the fiery law, In that majestic face. That face did all his gazing powers employ, With most profound abasement and exalted joy. The rolls of fate were half unseal'd, He stood adoring by; The volumes open'd to his eye, And sweet intelligence he held With all his shining kindred of the sky. VII. Ye seraphs that surround the throne, Tell how his name was thro' the palace known, How warm his zeal was, and how like your own; Speak it aloud, let half the nation hear, And bold blasphemers shrink and fear: Though he was so great and good a man he did not escape censure. Impudent tongues! to blast a prophet's name! The poison sure was fetch'd from hell, Where the old blasphemers dwell, To taint the purest dust, and blot the whitest fame! Impudent tongues! You should be darted thro', Nail'd to your own black mouths, and lie Useless and dead till slander die, Till slander die with you. VIII. ‘We saw him,’ say th'ethereal throng, ‘We saw his warm devotions rise, ‘We heard the fervour of his cries, ‘And mix'd his praises with our song: ‘We knew the secret flights of his retiring hours: ‘Nightly he wak'd his inward powers; ‘Young Israel rose to wrestle with his God, ‘And with unconquer'd force scal'd the celestial towers, ‘To reach the blessing down for those that sought his blood. ‘Oft we beheld the thunderer's hand ‘Rais'd high to crush the factious foe; ‘As oft we saw the rolling vengeance stand ‘Doubtful t'obey the dread command, ‘While his ascending pray'r upheld the falling blow.’ IX. Draw the past scenes of thy delight, My muse, and bring the wondrous man to sight. Place him surrounded as he stood With pious crowds, while from his tongue A stream of harmony ran soft along, And every ear drank in the flowing good: Softly it ran its silver way, Till warm devotion rais'd the current strong: Then fervid zeal on the sweet deluge rode, Life, love and glory, grace and joy, Divinely roll'd promiscuous on the torrent flood, And bore our raptur'd sense away, and thoughts and souls to God. O might we dwell for ever there! No more return to breathe this grosser air, This atmosphere of sin, calamity and care. X. But heav'nly scenes soon leave the sight While we belong to clay, Passions of terror and delight, Demand alternate sway. Behold the man, whose awful voice Could well proclaim the fiery law, Kindle the flames that Moses saw, And swell the trumpet's warlike noise. He stands the herald of the threat'ning skies, Lo, on his reverend brow the frowns divinely rise, All Sinai's thunder on his tongue, and lightning in his eyes. Round the high roof the curses flew Distinguishing each guilty head, Far from th'unequal war the atheist fled, His kindled arrows still pursue, His arrows strike the atheist thro', And o'er his inmost powers a shudd'ring horror spread. The marble heart groans with an inward wound: Blaspheming souls of harden'd steel Shriek out amaz'd at the new pangs they feel, And dread the echoes of the sound. The lofty wretch arm'd and array'd In gaudy pride sinks down his impious head, Plunges in dark despair, and mingles with the dead. XI. Now, muse, assume a softer strain, Now sooth the sinner's raging smart, Borrow of Gouge the wondrous art To calm the surging conscience, and assuage the pain; He from a bleeding God derives Life for the souls that guilt had slain, And straight the dying rebel lives, The dead arise again; The opening skies almosto bey His powerful song; a heav'nly ray Awakes despair to light, and sheds a cheerful day. His wond'rous voice rolls back the spheres, Recals the scenes of ancient years, To make the Saviour known; Sweetly the flying charmer roves Thro' all his labours and his loves, The anguish of his cross, and triumphs of his throne. XII. Come, he invites our feet to try The steep ascent of Calvary, And sets the fatal tree before our eye: See here celestial sorrow reigns; Rude nails and ragged thorns lay by, Ting'd with the crimson of redeeming veins. In wondrous words he sung the vital flood Where all our sins were drown'd, Words fit to heal and fit to wound, Sharp as the spear, and balmy as the blood. In his discourse divine Afresh the purple fountain flow'd; Our falling tears kept sympathetic time, And trickled to the ground, While ev'ry accent gave a doleful sound, Sad as the breaking heart-strings of th'expiring God. XIII. Down to the mansions of the dead, With trembling joy our souls are led, The captives of his tongue; There the dear Prince of light reclines his head Darkness and shades among. With pleasing horror we survey The caverns of the tomb, Where the belov'd Redeemer lay, And shed a sweet perfume. Hark! the old earthquake roars again In Gouge's voice, and breaks the chain Of heavy death, and rends the tombs: The rising God! he comes, he comes, With throngs of waking saints, a long triumphing train. XIV. See the bright squadrons of the sky. Downward on wings of joy and haste they fly, Meet their returning Sovereign, and attend him high. A shining car the Conqueror fills, Form'd of a golden cloud; Slowly the pomp moves up the azure hills, Old Satan foams and yells aloud, And gnaws th'eternal brass that binds him to the wheels. The opening gates of bliss receive their King, The Father-God smiles on his Son, Pays him the honours he has won, The lofty thrones adore, and little cherubs sing. Behold him on his native throne, Glory sits fast upon his head; Dress'd in new light, and beamy robes, His hand rolls on the seasons, and the shining globes, And sways the living worlds, and regions of the dead. XV. Gouge was his envoy to the realm below, Vast was his trust, and great his skill, Bright the credentials he could show, And thousands own'd the seal. His hallowed lips could well impart The grace, the promise, and command: He knew the pity of Immanuel's heart, And terrors of Jehovah's hand. How did our souls start out to hear The embassies of love he bare, While every ear in rapture hung Upon the charming wonders of his tongue. Life's busy cares a sacred silence bound, Attention stood with all her powers, With fixed eyes and awe profound, Chain'd to the pleasure of the sound, Nor knew the flying hours. XVI. But, O my everlasting grief! Heav'n has recall'd his envoy from our eyes, Hence deluges of sorrow rise, Nor hope th'impossible relief. Ye remnants of the sacred tribe Who feel the loss, come share the smart, And mix your groans with mine: Where is the tongue that can describe Infinite things with equal art, Or language so divine? Our passions want the heav'nly flame, Almighty love breathes faintly in our songs, And awful threat'nings languish on our tongues; Howe is a great but single name: Amidst the crowd he stands alone; Stands yet, but with his starry pinions on, Drest for the flight, and ready to be gone; Eternal God, command his stay, Stretch the dear months of his delay; O we could wish his age were one immortal day! But when the flaming chariots come, And shining guards, t'attend thy prophet home, Amidst a thousand weeping eyes, Send an Elisha down, a soul of equal size, Or burn this worthless globe, and take us to the skies.

      <field name="fulltext">RELIQUIÆ JUVENILES. MISCELLANEOUS THOUGHTS, IN PROSE AND VERSE, ON NATURAL, MORAL, AND DIVINE SUBJECTS; WRITTEN CHIEFLY IN YOUNGER YEARS. ET JUCUNDA SIMUL ET IDONEA DICERE VITÆ. —HOR. [My God, I love and I adore] My God, I love and I adore: But souls that love would know thee more. Wilt thou for ever hide, and stand Behind the labours of thy hand? Thy hand unseen sustains the poles On which this huge creation rolls: The starry arch proclaims thy pow'r, Thy pencil glows in ev'ry flow'r: In thousand shapes and colours rise Thy painted wonders to our eyes; While beasts and birds with lab'ring throats, Teach us a God in thousand notes. The meanest pin in nature's frame, Marks out some letter of thy name. Where sense can reach or fancy rove, From hill to hill, from field to grove, Across the waves, around the sky, There's not a spot, or deep, or high, Where the Creator has not trod, And left the footstep of a God. But are his footsteps all that we, Poor grov'ling worms, must know or see? Thou Maker of my vital frame, Unveil thy face, pronounce thy name, Shine to my sight, and let the ear Which thou hast form'd, thy language hear. Where is thy residence? Oh, why Dost thou avoid my searching eye, My longing sense? Thou great Unknown, Say, do the clouds conceal thy throne? Divide, ye clouds, and let me see The pow'r that gives me leave to be. Or art thou all diffus'd abroad Thro' boundless space, a present God, Unseen, unheard, yet ever near? What shall I do to find thee here? Is there not some mysterious art To feel thy presence at my heart? To hear thy whispers soft and kind, In holy silence of the mind? Then rest my thoughts; no longer roam In quest of joy, for heav'n's at home. But, oh, thy beams of warmest love! Sure they were made for worlds above. How shall my soul her pow'rs extend, Beyond where time and nature end, To reach those heights, thy best abode, And meet thy kindest smiles, my God? What shall I do? I wait thy call; Pronounce the word, my life, my all. Oh for a wing to bear me far Beyond the golden morning-star! Fain would I trace th'immortal way, That leads to courts of endless day, Where the Creator stands confess'd, In his own fairest glories dress'd. Some shining spirit help me rise, Come waft a stranger through the skies; Bless'd Jesus, meet me on the road, First offspring of th'eternal God, Thy hand shall lead a younger son, Clothe me with vestures yet unknown, And place me near my Father's throne. III.—TO DORIO. THE FIRST LYRIC HOUR. 'Twas an unclouded sky: The day-star sat On highest noon: No breezes fann'd the grove, Nor the musicians of the air pursu'd Their artless warblings; while the sultry day Lay all diffus'd and slumb'ring on the bosom Of the white lily, the perfum'd jonquil, And lovely blushing rose. Then first my harp, Labouring with childish innocence and joy, Brake silence, and awoke the smiling hour With infant notes, saluting the fair skies, (Heaven's highest work) the fair enamell'd meads, And tall green shades along the winding banks Of Avon gently flowing. Thence my days Commenc'd harmonious; there began my skill To vanquish care by the sweet-sounding string. Hail happy hour, O blest remembrance, hail! And banish woes for ever. Harps were made For heaven's beatitudes: There Jesse's son Tunes his bold lyre with majesty of sound, To the creating and all-ruling power Not unattentive: While ten thousand tongues Of hymning seraphs and disbodied saints Echo the joys and graces round the hills Of paradise, and spread Messiah's name. Transporting bliss! Make haste, ye rolling spheres, Ye circling suns, ye winged minutes, haste, Fulfil my destin'd period here, and raise The meanest son of harmony to join In that celestial concert. IV.—THE HEBREW POET. This Ode represents the Difficulty of a just Translation of the Psalms of David, in all their Hebrew Glory; with an Apology for the Imitation of them in Christian Language. (The first Hint borrowed from Casimire, Jessæa quisquis, &amp;c. Book IV. Ode 7.) I Show me the man that dares and sings Great David's verse to British strings: Sublime attempt! But bold and vain As building Babel's tower again. II The bard Sir John Denham, who gained great reputation by his poem called Cooper's Hill, failed in his translation of the Psalms of David. that climb'd to Cooper's Hill, Reaching at Zion, sham'd his skill, And bids the sons of Albion own, That Judah's psalmist reigns alone. III Blest poet! Now, like gentle Thames, He sooths our ears with silver streams: Like his own Jordan, now he rolls, And sweeps away our captive souls. IV Softly the tuneful shepherd leads The Hebrew flocks to flow'ry meads: He marks their path with notes divine, While fountains spring with oil and wine. V Rivers of peace attend his song, And draw their milky train along: He jars; and lo, the flints are broke, But honey issues from the rock. VI When kindling with victorious fire, He shakes his lance across the lyre; The lyre resounds unknown alarms, And sets the Thunderer in arms. VII Behold the God! Th'almighty King Rides on a tempest's glorious wing: His ensigns lighten round the sky, And moving legions sound on high. VIII Ten thousand cherubs wait his course, Chariots of fire and flaming horse; Earth trembles; and her mountains flow, At his approach, like melting snow. IX But who those frowns of wrath can draw, That strike heav'n, earth, and hell, with awe? Red lightning from his eyelids broke; His voice was thunder, hail and smoke. X He spake; the cleaving waters fled, And stars beheld the ocean's bed: While the great master strikes his lyre, You see the frighted floods retire: XI In heaps the frighted billows stand, Waiting the changes of his hand: He leads his Israel through the sea, And watry mountains guard their way. XII Turning his hand with sov'reign sweep, He drowns all Egypt in the deep: Then guides the tribes, a glorious band, Thro' deserts to the promis'd land. XIII Here camps with wide imbattl'd force, Here gates and bulwarks stop their course: He storms the mounds, the bulwark falls, The harp lies strew'd with ruin'd walls. XIV See his broad sword flies o'er the strings, And moves down nations with their kings: From every chord his bolts are hurl'd, And vengeance smites the rebel world. XV Lo, the great poet shifts the scene, And shows the face of God serene: Truth, meekness, peace, salvation ride, With guards of justice, at his side. XVI No meaner muse could weave the light, To form his robes divinely bright; Or frame a crown of stars to shine With beams for majesty divine. XVII Now in prophetic light he sees Ages to come, and dark decrees: He brings the Prince of glory down, Stript of his robe and starry crown. XVIII See Jews and heathens fir'd with rage; See their combining pow'rs engage Against th'Anointed of the Lord, The man whom angels late ador'd, XIX God's only Son: Behold, he dies: Surprising grief! The groans arise, The lyre complains on ev'ry string, And mourns the murder of her King. XX But heav'n's Anointed must not dwell In death: The vanquish'd pow'rs of hell Yield to the harp's diviner lay; The grave resigns th'illustrious prey. XXI Messiah lives! Messiah reigns! The song surmounts the airy plains, T'attend her Lord with joys unknown, And bear the Victor to his throne. XXII Rejoice, ye shining worlds on high, Behold the Lord of glory nigh: Eternal doors, your leaves display, To make the Lord of glory way. XXIII What mortal bard has skill or force To paint these scenes, to tread this course, Or furnish through the ethereal road A triumph for a rising God? XXIV Astonish'd at so vast a flight Thro' flaming worlds and floods of light, My muse her awful distance keeps, Still following but with trembling steps. XXV She bids her humble verse explain The Hebrew harp's sublimer strain; Points to her Saviour still, and shows What course the sun of glory goes. XXVI Here he ascends behind a cloud Of incense Christ's intercession., there he sets in blood His sacrifice.; She reads his labours and his names In spicy smoke His sacrifice., and bleeding lambs His sacrifice.. XXVII Rich are the graces which she draws From types, and shades, and jewish laws; With thousand glories long foretold To turn the future age to gold. XXVIII Grace is her theme, and joy, and love: Descend, ye blessings, from above, And crown my song. Eternal God, Forgive the muse that dreads thy rod. XXIX Silent, she hears thy vengeance roll, That crushes mortals to the soul, Nor dares assume the bold, nor sheds Th'immortal curses on their heads. XXX Yet since her God is still the same, And David's son is all her theme, She begs some humble place to sing In concert with Judea's king. V.—THE THANKFUL PHILOSOPHER. I When God the new-made world survey'd, His word pronounc'd the building good; Sun-beams and light the heav'ns array'd, And the whole earth was crown'd with food. II Colours that charm and ease the eye, His pencil spread all nature round; With pleasing blue he arch'd the sky, And a green carpet dress'd the ground. III Let envious atheists ne'er complain That nature wants or skill, or care; But turn their eyes all round in vain, T'avoid their Maker's goodness there. IX.—THE SACRED CONCERT OF PRAISE. I Come, pretty birds, fly to this verdant shade, Here let our different notes in praise conspire: 'Twas the same hand your painted pinions spread, That form'd my nobler pow'rs to raise his honours higher. II Fair songsters, come; beneath the sacred grove We'll sit and teach the woods our Maker's name: Men have forgot his works, his power, his love, Forgot the mighty arm that rear'd their wondrous frame. III I search the crowded court, the busy street, Run thro' the villages, trace every road: In vain I search; for every heart I meet Is laden with the world, and empty of its God. IV How shall I bear with men to spend my days? Dear feather'd innocents, you please me best: My God has fram'd your voices for his praise, His high designs are answer'd by your tuneful breast. V Sweet warblers, come, wake all your cheerful tongues, We join with angels and their heav'nly choirs; Our humble airs may imitate their songs, Tho' bolder are their notes, and purer are their fires. VI Had I ten thousand hearts, my God, my Love, Had I ten thousand voices all are thine: Where love inflames the soul, the lips must move, Nor shall the song be mortal where the theme's divine. X.—THE WORLD A STRANGER TO GOD. I Infinite beauty, everlasting love, How are our hearts, our thoughts, estrang'd from thee! Th'eternal God surrounds us; yet we rove In chase of airy toys, and follow as they flee. II Oh could I cry, and make the nations hear, From north to south my voice should teach thy name; I'd tell them, that they buy their joys too dear, And pay immortal souls for glitt'ring dust or fame. III Almighty pow'r, break off these chains of sense, Melt them away with love's celestial fire, Create the world anew; let man commence A seraph here on earth, let man to heav'n aspire. XIII.—THE MIDNIGHT ELEVATION. I. Now reigns the night in her sublimest noon, Nature lies hush'd; the stars their watches keep; I wait thy influence, gentle sleep, Come shed thy choicest poppies down, On every sense, sweet slumbers seal my eyes, Tir'd with the scenes of day, with painted vanities. II. In vain I wish, in vain I try To close my eyes and learn to die; Sweet slumbers from my restless pillow fly: Then be my thoughts serene as day, Be sprightly as the light, Swift as the sun's far-shooting ray, And take a vigorous flight: Swift fly, my soul, transcend these dusky skies, And trace the vital world that lies Beyond those glimmering fires that gild and cheer the night. III. There Jesus reigns, adored name! The second on the throne supreme: In whose mysterious form combine Created glories and divine: The joy and wonder of the realms above: At his command all their wing'd squadrons move, Burn with his fire, and triumph in his love. IV. There souls releas'd from earth's dark bondage live, My Reynolds there, with Howe and Boyle are found; Not time nor nature could their genius bound, And now they soar, and now they dive In that unlimitable deep where thought itself is drown'd. They aid the seraphs while they sing, God is their unexhausted theme; Light, life and joy for that immortal spring O'erflow the blessed millions with an endless stream. Amazing state! Divine abode! Where spirits find their heaven while they are lost in God. V. Hail, holy souls, no more confin'd To limbs and bones that clog the mind; Ye have escap'd the snares, and left the chains behind. We wretched prisoners here below, What do we see, or learn or know, But scenes of various folly, guilt and woe? Life's buzzing sounds and flatt'ring colours play Round our fond sense, and waste the day, Inchant the fancy, vex the labouring soul; Each rising sun, each lightsome hour, Beholds the busy slavery we endure; Nor is our freedom full, or contemplation pure, When night and sacred silence overspread the pole. VI. Reynolds, thou late ascended mind, Employ'd in various thought and tuneful song, What happy moment shall my soul unbind, And bid me join th'harmonious throng? Oh for a wing to rise to thee! When shall my eyes those heav'nly wonders see? When shall I taste those comforts with an ear refin'd? VII. Roll on apace, ye spheres sublime, Swift drive thy chariot round, illustrious moon, Haste, all ye winkling measures of time, Ye can't fulfil your course too soon. Kindle my languid pow'rs, celestial love, Point all my passions to the courts above, Then send the convoy down to guard my last remove. VIII. Thrice happy world, where gilded toys No more disturb our thoughts, no more pollute our joys! There light and shade succeed no more by turns, There reigns th'eternal sun with an unclouded ray, There all is calm as night, yet all immortal day, And truth for ever shines, and love for ever burns. XIV.—THE HONOURABLE MAGISTRATE. [There are a number of us creep] Paraphrase. There are a number of us creep Into this world, to eat and sleep; And know no reason why they're born, But merely to consume the corn, Devour the cattle, fowl and fish, And leave behind an empty dish: The crows and ravens do the same, Unlucky birds of hateful name; Ravens or crows might fill their plae, And swallow corn and carcases. Then if their tomb-stone, when they die, Ben't taught to flatter and to lie, There's nothing better will be said, Than that, ‘They've eat up all their bread, ‘Drank up their drink, and gone to bed.’ [Life's but a feast; and when we die] Which may be thus put into English. Life's but a feast; and when we die, Horace would say, if he were by, ‘Friend, thou hast eat and drank enough, ‘'Tis time now to be marching off: ‘Then like a well-fed guest depart, ‘With cheerful looks, and ease at heart; ‘Bid all your friends good-night, and say, ‘You've done the business of the day.’ [Deluded souls! that sacrifice] Reflection. Deluded souls! that sacrifice Eternal hopes above the skies, And pour their lives out all in waste, To the vile idol of their taste! The highest heav'n of their pursuit Is to live equal with the brute: Happy, if they could die as well, Without a judge, without a hell! XVIII—YOUTH AND DEATH A milk-white mark its spreading front adorns, Shaped like a moon of three days old: The silver curve divides its budding horns, And all besides is gold. The pretty creature, wild in wanton play, Now frisks about the flow'ry mead; Loose from the dam, it knows no grief to-day, But must to-morrow bleed. XIX.—BABYLON DESTROYED; OR, THE 137TH PSALM TRANSLATED. I When by the flowing brooks we sat, The brooks of Babylon the proud; We thought on Zion's mournful state, And wept her woes, and wail'd aloud. II Thoughtless of every cheerful air (For grief had all our harps unstrung) Our harps, neglected in despair, And silent, on the willows hung. III Our foes, who made our land their spoil, Our barbarous lords, with haughty tongues, Bid us forget our groans awhile, And give a taste of Zion's songs. IV How shall we sing in heathen lands Our holy songs to ears profane? Lord, shall our lips at their commands Pronounce thy dreadful name in vain? V Forbid it heaven! O vile abuse! Zion in dust forbids it too: Shall hymns inspired for sacred use Be sung to please a scoffing crew? VI O let my tongue grow dry, and cleave Fast to my mouth in silence still; Let some avenging pow'r bereave My fingers of their tuneful skill. VII If I thy sacred rites profane, O Salem, or thy dust despise; If I indulge one cheerful strain, Till I shall see thy tow'rs arise. VIII 'Twas Edom bid the conqu'ring foe, ‘Down with the tow'rs, and rase thy walls:’ Requite her, Lord: But, Babel, know, Thy guilt for fiercer vengeance calls. IX As thou hast spared nor sex nor age, Deaf to our infants' dying groans, May some bless'd hand, inspir'd with rage, Dash thy young babes, and tinge the stones. XX.—AN EPITAPH ON BIGOTRY, TRANSLATED FROM THE LATIN, Which was written by the late pious and ingenious MR. JOHN REYNOLDS, And inserted in the Occasional Paper, Vol. III. Numb. 6. I. Here lies (and may it here for ever lie) The carcase of dead piety, Shadow of grace, substantial sin, Religion's mask and gaudy dress, The form and foe of holiness, The image and the plague of zeal divine. Its dwelling was the church; in double shape, Half was a murdering wolf, and half a mimic ape. II. A monster horrid to the sight, Hideous, deform'd, and void of light; 'Twas born at Rome, 'Twas nurs'd at home, In the dark cloisters of the Vatican; Its lungs inspir'd with heaving lies, Its bulk well-fatten'd to prodigious size With gun-powder and blood of man. III. Ancient inhabitant of Spain, And long in France a welcome guest; Over the continent and main, Over the old world and the new, Mankind and money to pursue, On dragons' wings the harpy flew, And gave its feet no rest. IV. All languages the fury spake, And did of either sex partake: Flaming enlight'ner of the mind, And headlong leader of the blind, Oft has it dragg'd the doubtful tongue to speak, While the pain'd conscience left the truth behind. By gibbet, sword and fire, It made whole tribes of men expire; And to the skies their groaning ghosts it hurl'd, A swift converter of the world. Dext'rous in all the arts of blood: Skill'd to contrive or counterfeit Mysterious mischief, plots of state, Those murd'rous engines to destroy the good. [The muse here tiring, begs the reader's leave to release herself from the bonds and labours of rhyme and meter, by a mere imitation of the next thirty lines in prose.] V. Under the name and habit of the church, Under the countenance and clothing of a sheep, It became the most savage and rampant Plunderer and waster of human society, Made fearful inroads on all civil commerce, And left religious liberty expiring. VI. A warrior well furnish'd With all arts politic and polite, With the knotty embarrassments of criticism, The hampering chains and subtleties of logic, And the javelins of pen and tongue, With the roaring ordinance of councils and canons, And all the artillery of the schools and gown. VII. Fury, hatred and mischief, Love of this world, pride and disdain, With perjuries, falsehoods, and pious frauds, And raging party-zeal, Were its necessary and everlasting attendants. High encomiums and endless applause Of guides infallible, and faith implicit, Of hereditary and divine right, Of unlimited power and passive obedience To tyrant priests and kings, With the immortal praise and merit Of stupid ignorance, and blind submission, Were heralds to prepare its way. VIII. Trifles, and tricks, and solemn fooleries, Legends and silly tales, Old almanacks, and mouldy musty relics, Sweepings of ancient tombs, Vows, pilgrimages, charms and consecrations, Rites obsolete, and novel ceremonies Both decent and indecent, Monkish vows, and superstitious austerities, With words of sacerdotal absolution, And sacerdotal vengeance, Squibs, crackers, excommunications, curses, Roaring bulls, and vain thunders, Mixt up with priestly choler, bitter and black, Were its delicious food. [Now metre and rhyme proceed.] IX. A purple prelate, chosen to preside Over the whole Ignatian drove, And all the clergy-tribes beside, All but the sacred few that mix their zeal with love. In ev'ry different sect 'twas known, It made the cassock and the cowl its own, Now stalk'd in formal cloak, now flutter'd in the gown. X. At what dark hour soe'er, The curst divan at Rome were met, Catholic faith to propagate, This monster fill'd the chair. The conclave drest in bonnets red, With three-crown'd tyrant at their head, Made it their privy-counsellor. The inquisition court (a bloody crew, Artful to set the solemn trap That lets no heretic escape) Owns it her president and founder too. XI. Oft as the church in east or western lands Rising against herself in arms, In her own blood imbru'd her hands, This chief led on th'unnatural war, Or did the bloody standards bear, Or sound the fierce alarms; Victorious still. (And what can more be said Of all the living warriors, or the heroes dead?) XII. Britain, a land well stor'd with every good, That nature, law, religion gives; A land where sacred freedom thrives; Blest isle! If her own weal she understood! Her sons, immur'd with guardian ocean, sleep, And castles floating on the deep, Fenc'd from all foreign foes, O shame! O sin! Her sons had let this baleful mischief in; This hellish fury, who with flatt'ring breath Did first divide, and then devour, And made wild waste where'er she spread her pow'r, Behold she meets her fatal hour And lies inchain'd in death. XIII. Shout at thy grave, O traveller; Triumphant joys that reach the skies Are here the justest obsequies: Shout thrice; then flee afar The pois'nous steams and stenches of the sepulchre; Go, turn thy face to heaven, and pray, That such a hateful monster never may Obtain a resurrection-day. XXII.—AN HYMN TO CHRIST JESUS, THE ETERNAL LIFE. I Where shall the tribes of Adam find The sov'reign good to fill the mind? Ye sons of moral wisdom, show The spring whence living waters flow. II Say, will the Stoic's flinty heart Melt, and this cordial juice impart? Could Plato find these blissful streams, Amongst his raptures and his dreams? III In vain I ask; for nature's power Extends but to this mortal hour: 'Twas but a poor relief she gave Against the terrors of the grave. IV Jesus, our kinsman, and our God, Array'd in majesty and blood, Thou art our life; our souls in thee Possess a full felicity. V All our immortal hopes are laid In thee, our surety, and our head; Thy cross, thy cradle, and thy throne, Are big with glories yet unknown. VI Let atheists scoff, and Jews blaspheme Th'eternal life, and Jesus' name; A word of his almighty breath Dooms the rebellious world to death. VII But let my soul for ever lie Beneath the blessings of thine eye; 'Tis heav'n on earth, 'tis heav'n above, To see thy face, to taste thy love. XXIV—DAVID'S LAMENTATION OVER SAUL AND JONATHAN;2 SAM i.19&amp;c. Paraphrased thus I. Unhappy day! Distressing sight! Israel, the land of heav'n's delight, How is thy strength, thy beauty fled! On the high places of the fight Behold thy princes fall'n, thy sons of victory dead. II. Ne'er be it told in Gath, nor known Among the streets of Askelon: How will Philistia's youth rejoice And triumph in our shame, And girls with weak unhallowed voice Chant the dishonours of the Hebrew name! III. Mountains of Gilboa, let no dew Nor fruitful show'rs descend on you: Curse on your fields thro' all the year, No flow'ry blessings there appear, Nor golden ranks of harvest stand To grace the altar, or to feed the land. 'Twas in those inauspicious fields Judean heroes lost their shields: 'Twas there (ah base reproach and scandal of the day!) Thy shield, O Saul, was cast away, As tho' the prophet's horn had never shed Its sacred odours on thy head. IV. The sword of Saul had ne'er till now, Awoke to war in vain, Nor Jonathan withdrawn his bow, Without an army slain. Where truth and honour mark'd their way, Not eagles swifter to their prey, Nor lions strong or bold as they. V. Graceful in arms and great in war Were Jonathan and Saul, Pleasant in life, and manly fair; Nor death divides the royal pair, And thousands share their fall. Daughters of Israel, melt your eyes To softer tears, and swell your sighs, Disrob'd, disgrac'd, your monarch lies, On the bleak mountains, pale and cold: He made rich scarlet your array; Bright were your looks, your bosoms gay With gems of regal gift, and interwoven gold. VI. How are the princes sunk in death! Fall'n on the shameful ground! There my own Jonathan resign'd his breath: On the high places where he stood, He lost his honours and his blood; Oh execrable arm that gave the mortal wound! VII. My Jonathan, my better part, My brother, and (that dearer name) my friend, I feel the mortal wound that reach'd thy heart, And here my comforts end. How pleasant was thy love to me! Amazing passion, strong and free! No dangers could thy steady soul remove: Not the soft virgin loves to that degree, Nor man to that degree does the soft virgin love. To name my joys, awakes my pain; The dying friend runs cold through every vein. My Jonathan, my dying friend, How thick my woes arise! Where will my sorrows end? VIII. Unhappy day! Distressing sight! Israel, the land of heaven's delight, How are thy princes fall'n thy sons of victory slain! The broken bow, the shiver'd spear, With all the sully'd pomp of war, In rude confusion spread, Promiscuous lie among the dead, A lamentable rout o'er all the inglorious plain. XXIX.—ON THE SIGHT OF QUEEN MARY, IN THE YEAR 1694. I I saw th'illustrious form, I saw Beauty that gave the nations law: Her eyes, like mercy on a throne, In condescending grandeur shone. II That blooming face! How lovely fair Hath nature mix'd her wonders there! The rosy morn such lustre shows Glancing along the Scythian snows. III Her shape, her motion, and her mien, All heav'nly; such are angels seen, When the bright vision grows intense, And fancy aids our feeble sense. IV Earth's proudest idols dare not vie With such superior majesty: A kindling vapour might as soon Rise from the bogs, and mate the moon. V I'll call no Raphael from his rest; Such charms can never be exprest: Pencil and paint were never made To draw pure light without a shade. VI Britain beholds her Queen with pride, And mighty William at her side Gracing the throne, while at their feet With humble joy three nations meet. VII Secure of empire, she might lay Her crown, her robes, and state away, And 'midst ten thousand nymphs be seen: Her beauty would proclaim the queen. Epanorthosis. VIII Her guardian angel heard my song, Fond man, he cry'd, forbear to wrong My lovely charge. So vulgar eyes Gaze at the stars, and praise the skies. IX Rudely they praise, who dwell below, And heav'n's true glories never know, Where stars and planets are no more Than pebbles scatter'd on the floor. X So, where celestial virtues join'd Form an incomparable mind, Crowns, sceptres, beauties, charms and air, Stand but as shining servants there. XXX.—ON THE EFFIGIES OF HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS GEORGE, LATE PRINCE OF DENMARK, AND LORD HIGH ADMIRAL OF GREAT BRITAIN, MADE IN WAX, AND SEATED AT A BANQUET NEAR THE EFFIGIES OF HER LATE MAJESTY QUEEN ANNE. All happily performed in a very near imitation of the life, by Chrysis. 1705. So look'd the hero, coming from the board Of naval counsels, and put off his sword. So sat the Prince, when with a smiling air He relish'd life, and pleas'd his Sovereign Fair, Surprising form! Scarce with a softer mien Did his first love address his future Queen. Publish the wonder, fame. This poem was written just after prince George's death. But O! forbear T'approach the palace and the royal ear, Lest her impatient love and wishing eye Seek the dear image, gaze, and mourn and die. Or stay: The royal mourner will believe Her George restor'd, and so forget to grieve. What cannot Chrysis do? Those artful hands Shall raise the hero: Lo, in arms he stands: Fairbourn Two British admirals. and Leak Two British admirals. submissive shall espy War on his brow, and orders in his eye, Auspicious, just, and wise: The fleet obeys, And the French pirates flee the British seas. Albinus. ‘Clear as the glass, his spotless fame, ‘And lasting diamond writes his name.’ [‘Words of eternal truth proclaim] ‘Words of eternal truth proclaim, ‘All mortal joys are vain: ‘A diamond-pen engraves the theme ‘Upon a brittle pane.’ XXXV.—AGAINST LEWDNESS. I Why should you let your wand'ring eyes Entice your souls to shameful sin? Scandal and ruin are the prize, You take such fatal pains to win. II This brutal vice makes reason blind, And blots the name with hateful stains: It wastes the flesh, pollutes the mind, And tears the heart with racking pains. III Let David speak, with deepest groans, How it estrang'd his soul from God, Made him complain of broken bones, And fill'd his house with wars and blood. IV Let Solomon and Samson tell Their melancholy stories here, How bright they shone, how low they fell, When sin's vile pleasures cost them dear. V In vain you choose the darkest time, Nor let the sun behold the sight: In vain you hope to hide your crime Behind the curtains of the night: VI The wakeful stars and midnight moon Watch your foul deeds and know your shame; And God's own eye, like beams of noon, Strikes thro' the shade, and marks your name. VII What will you do when heav'n enquires Into those scenes of secret sin? And lust, with all its guilty fires, Shall make your conscience rage within? VIII How will you curse your wanton eyes, Curse the lewd partners of your shame, When death, with horrible surprise, Shows you the pit of quenchless flame? IX Flee, sinners, flee th'unlawful bed, Lest vengeance send you down to dwell In the dark regions of the dead, To feed the fiercest fires of hell. XXXVI.—AGAINST DRUNKENNESS. I Is it not strange that every creature Should know the measure of its thirst, (They drink but to support their nature, And give due moisture to their dust;) II While man, vile man, whose nobler kind Should scorn to act beneath the beast, Drowns all the glories of his mind, And kills his soul to please his taste! III O what a hateful, shameful sight, Are drunkards reeling through the street! Now they are fond, and now they fight, And pour their shame on all they meet. IV Is it so exquisite a pleasure To troll down liquor through the throat, And swill, and know no bound nor measure, 'Till sense and reason are forgot? V Do they deserve th'immortal name Of man, who sink so far below? Will God, the maker of their frame, Endure to see them spoil it so? VI Can they e'er think of heav'n and grace, Or hope for glory when they die? Can such vile ghosts expect a place, Among the shining souls on high? VII The meanest seat is too refin'd To entertain a drunkard there. Ye sinners of this loathsome kind, Repent, or perish in despair. XXXVIII.—PASSION AND REASON. I Let Astrapé forbear to blaze, As lightning does, with dreadful rays, Nor spoil the beauties of her face, To arm her tongue with thunder: That reason hardly looks divine, Where so much fire and sound combine, And make the way for wit to shine By riving sense asunder. II Yet if I found her words grow warm, I'd learn some lesson by the storm, Or guard myself at least from harm By yielding, like Tranquillus. Tempests will tear the stiffest oak, Cedars with all their pride are broke Beneath the fury of that stroke That never hurts the willows. XLVI.—COWARDICE AND SELF-LOVE. Paraphrased thus: He never was the man that dar'd to swim Against the rolling tide, or cross the stream; He was no patriot, nor indulg'd his breath Bravely to speak his sense, and venture death. Thus he spun out his supple soul, and drew A length of life amidst a vicious crew; Full fourscore years he saw the sun arise, Guarded by flattery, and intrench'd in lies; For 'twas his settled judgment from his youth, One grain of ease was worth a world of truth. O cursed idol Self! The wretch that worships thee would dare to tread With impious feet on his own father's head, To 'scape a rising wave when seas the land invade. To gain the safety of some higher ground, He'd trample down the dikes that fence his country round Amidst a general flood, and leave the nation drown'd. THOUGHTS AND MEDITATIONS IN A LONG SICKNESS. 1712 AND 1713. The Hurry of the Spirits, in a Fever and Nervous Disorders. 1712 AND 1713. My frame of nature is a ruffled sea, And my disease the tempest. Nature feels A strange commotion to her inmost centre; The throne of reason shakes. ‘Be still, my thoughts; ‘Peace and be still.’ In vain my reason gives The peaceful word, my spirit strives in vain To calm the tumult and command my thoughts. This flesh, this circling blood, these brutal powers, Made to obey, turn rebels to the mind, Nor hear its laws. The engine rules the man. Unhappy change! When nature's meaner springs, Fir'd to impetuous ferments, break all order; When little restless atoms rise and reign Tyrants in sov'reign uproar, and impose Ideas on the mind; confus'd ideas Of non-existents and impossibles, Who can describe them? Fragments of old dreams, Borrow'd from midnight, torn from fairy fields And fairy skies, and regions of the dead, Abrupt, ill-sorted! O 'tis all confusion! If I but close my eyes, strange images In thousand forms and thousand colours rise, Stars, rainbows, moons, green dragons, bears and ghosts, An endless medley rush upon the stage, And dance and riot wild in reason's court Above control. I'm in a raging storm, Where seas and skies are blended, while my soul Like some light worthless chip of floating cork Is tost from wave to wave: Now overwhelm'd With breaking floods, I drown, and seem to lose All being: Now high-mounted on the ridge Of a tall foaming surge, I'm all at once Caught up into the storm, and ride the wind, The whistling wind; unmanageable steed, And feeble rider! Hurried many a league Over the rising hills of roaring brine, Thro' airy wilds unknown, with dreadful speed And infinite surprise; till some few minutes Have spent the blast, and then perhaps I drop Near to the peaceful coast; some friendly billow Lodges me on the beach, and I find rest: Short rest I find; for the next rolling wave Snatches me back again; then ebbing far Sets me adrift, and I am borne off to sea, Helpless, amidst the bluster of the winds, Beyond the ken of shore. Ah, when will these tumultuous scenes be gone? When shall this weary spirit, tost with tempests, Harass'd and broken, reach the port of rest, And hold it firm? When shall this wayward flesh With all th'irregular springs of vital movement Ungovernable, return to sacred order, And pay their duties to the ruling mind? Peace of Conscience and Prayer for Health. Yet gracious God, amidst these storms of nature, Thine eyes beheld a sweet and sacred calm Reign thro' the realms of conscience: All within Lies peaceful, and compos'd. 'Tis wondrous grace Keeps off thy terrors from this humble bosom, Tho' stain'd with sins and follies, yet serene In penitential peace and cheerful hope, Sprinkled and guarded with atoning blood. Thy vital smiles amidst this desolation Like heav'nly sun-beams hid behind the clouds, Break out in happy moments, with bright radiance Cleaving the gloom; the fair celestial light Softens and gilds the horrors of the storm, And richest cordials to the heart conveys. O glorious solace of immense distress, A conscience and a God! A friend at home, And better friend on high! This is my rock Of firm support, my shield of sure defence Against infernal arrows. Rise, my soul, Put on thy courage: Here's the living spring Of joys divinely sweet and ever new, ‘A peaceful conscience and a smiling heaven.’ My God, permit a creeping worm to say, ‘Thy Spirit knows I love thee.’ Worthless wretch, To dare to love a God! But grace requires, And grace accepts. Thou seest my labouring soul: Weak as my zeal is, yet my zeal is true; It bears the trying furnace. Love divine Constrains me; I am thine. Incarnate love Has seiz'd and holds me in almighty arms: Here's my salvation, my eternal hope, Amidst the wreck of worlds and dying nature, ‘I am the Lord's, and he for ever mine.’ O thou all-powerful Word, at whose first call Nature arose; this earth, these shining heavens, These stars in all their ranks came forth, and said, ‘We are thy servants:’ Didst thou not create My frame, my breath, my being, and bestow A mind immortal on thy feeble creature Who faints before thy face? Did not thy pity Dress thee in flesh to die, that I might live, And with thy blood redeem this captive soul From guilt and death? O thrice adored name, My King, my Saviour, my Immanuel, say, Have not thy eyelids mark'd my painful toil, The wild confusions of my shatter'd powers, And broken fluttering thoughts? Hast thou not seen Each restless atom, that with vexing influence Works thro' the mass of man? Each noxious juice, Each ferment that infects the vital humours, That heaves the veins with huge disquietude And spreads the tumult wide? Do they not lie Beneath thy view, and all within thy reach? Yes, all at thy command, and must obey Thy sovereign touch: Thy touch is health and life, And harmony to nature's jarring strings. When shall my midnight-sighs and morning groans Rise thro' the heights of heaven, and reach thy ear Propitious? See, my spirit's feeble powers Exhal'd and breathing upward to thy throne, Like early incense climbing thro' the sky From the warm altar. When shall grace and peace Descend with blessings, like an evening shower On the parch'd desert, and renew my bloom? Or must thy creature breathe his soul away In fruitless groans, and die? Come, blest physician, come attend the moan Of a poor suffering wretch, a plaintive worm, Crush'd in the dust and helpless. O descend, Array'd in power and love, and bid me rise. Incarnate goodness, send thy influence down To these low regions of mortality Where thou hast dwelt, and clad in fleshly weeds Learnt sympathetic sorrows; send and heal My long and sore distress. Ten thousand praises Attend thee: David's harp is ready strung For the Messiah's At this time my Imitation of David's Psalms in christian language was not half done: As fast as I recovered strength after this long illness, I applied myself by degrees to finish it. name: A winged flight Of songs harmonious, and new honours wait The steps of moving mercy. Encouraged to hope for Health in May. DECEMBER 1712. Confin'd to sit in silence, here I waste The golden hours of youth. If once I stir, And reach at active life, what sudden tremors Shake my whole frame, and all the poor machine Lies fluttering? What strange wild convulsive force O'erpowers at once the members and the will; Here am I bound in chains, a useless load Of breathing clay, a burthen to the seat That bears these limbs, a borderer on the grave. Poor state of worthless being! While the lamp Of glimmering life burns languishing and dim, The flame just hovering o'er the dying snuff With doubtful alternations, half disjoin'd, And ready to expire with every blast. Yet my fond friends would speak a word of hope: Love would forbid despair: ‘Look out,’ they cry, ‘Beyond these glooming damps, while winter hangs ‘Heavy on nature, and congeals her powers: ‘Look cheerful forward to the vital influence ‘Of the returning spring!’ I rouse my thoughts At friendship's sacred voice, I send my soul To distant expectation, and support The painful interval with poor amusements. My watch, the solitary kind companion Of my imprisonment, my faithful watch Hangs by; and with a short repeated sound Beats like the pulse of time, and numbers off My woes, a long succession; while the finger Slow moving, points out the slow-moving minutes; The slower hand, the hours. O thou dear engine, Thou little brass accomptant of my life, Would but the mighty wheels of heaven and nature Once imitate thy movements, how my hand Should drive thy dented pinions round their centres With more than ten-fold flight, and whirl away These clouded wintry suns, these tedious moons, These midnights; every star should speed its race, And the slow bears precipitate their way Around the frozen pole: Then promis'd health That rides with rosy cheek and blooming grace On a May sun-beam should attend me here Before to-morrow sheds its evening-dew. Ah foolish ravings of a fruitless wish And spirit too impatient! Know'st thou not, My soul, the Power that made thee? He alone Who form'd the spheres, rolls them in destin'd rounds Unchangeable. Adore, and trust, and fear him: He is the Lord of life. Address his throne, And wait before his foot, with awful hope Submissive; at his touch distemper flies: His eyelids send beams of immortal youth Thro' heaven's bright regions. His all-powerful word Can create health, and bid the blessing come Amid the wintry frost, when nature seems Congeal'd in death; or with a sovereign frown (Tho' nature blooms all round) he can forbid The blessing in the spring, and chain thee down To pains, and maladies, and grievous bondage Thro' all the circling seasons. The Wearisome Weeks of Sickness. 1712 OR 1713. Thus pass my days away. The cheerful sun Rolls round the gilds the world with lightsome beams, Alas, in vain to me; cut off alike From the bless'd labours, and the joys of life: While my sad minutes in their tiresome train Serve but to number out my heavy sorrows. By night I count the clock; perhaps eleven, Or twelve, or one; then with a wishful sigh Call on the ling'ring hours, ‘Come two, come five: ‘When will the day-light come?’ Make haste, ye mornings, Ye evening-shadows haste; wear out these days, These tedious rounds of sickness, and conclude The weary week for ever— Then the sweet day of sacred rest returns, Sweet day of rest, devote to God and heaven, And heav'nly business, purposes divine, Angelic work: But not to me returns Rest with the day: Ten thousand hurrying thoughts Bear me away tumultuous far from heaven And heavenly work. In vain I heave, and toil, And wrestle with my inward foes in vain, O'erpower'd and vanquish'd still: They drag me down From things celestial, and confine my sense To present maladies. Unhappy state, Where the poor spirit is subdu'd t'endure Unholy idleness, a painful absence! And bound to bear the agonies and woes From God, and heaven, and angel's blessed work, That sickly flesh on shatter'd nerves impose. How long, O Lord, how long? A Hymn of Praise for Recovery. Happy for man, that the slow circling moons And long revolving seasons measure out The tiresome pains of nature! Present woes Have their sweet periods. Ease and cheerful health With slow approach (so Providence ordains) Revisit their forsaken mansion here, And days of useful life diffuse their dawn O'er the dark cottage of my weary soul. My vital powers resume their vigour now, My spirit feels her freedom, shakes her wings, Exults and spatiates o'er a thousand scenes, Surveys the world, and with full stretch of thought Grasps her ideas; while impatient zeal Awakes my tongue to praise. What mortal voice Or mortal hand can render to my God The tribute due? What altars shall I raise? What grand inscription to proclaim his mercy In living lines? Where shall I find a victim Meet to be offered to his sovereign love, And solemnize the worship and the joy? Search well, my soul, thro' all the dark recesses Of nature and self-love, the plies, the folds, And hollow winding caverns of the heart, Where flattery hides our sins; search out the foes Of thy almighty friend; what lawless passions, What vain desires, what vicious turns of thought Lurk there unheeded: Bring them forth to view, And sacrifice the rebels to his honour. Well he deserves this worship at thy hands, Who pardons thy past follies, who restores Thy mouldring fabric, and withholds thy life From the near borders of a gaping grave. Almighty power, I love thee, blissful name, My healer God; and may my inmost heart Love and adore for ever! O 'tis good To wait submissive at thy holy throne, To leave petitions at thy feet, and bear Thy frowns and silence with a patient soul. The hand of mercy is not short to save, Nor is the ear of heavenly pity deaf To mortal cries. It notic'd all my groans, And sighs, and long complaints, with wise delay, Tho' painful to the sufferer, and thy hand In proper moment brought desired relief. Rise from my couch, ye late enfeebled limbs, Prove your new strength, and show the effective skill Of the divine physician; bear away This tottering body to his sacred threshold: There, laden with his honours, let me bow Before his feet; let me pronounce his grace, Pronounce salvation thro' his dying Son, And teach this sinful world the Saviour's name. Then rise, my hymning soul, on holy notes Tow'rd his high throne; awake, my choicest songs, Run echoing round the roof, and while you pay The solemn vows of my distressful hours, A thousand friendly lips shall aid the praise. Jesus, great Advocate, whose pitying eye Saw my long anguish, and with melting heart And powerful intercession spread'st my woes With all my groans before the Father-God, Bear up my praises now; thy holy incense Shall hallow all my sacrifice of joy, And bring these accents grateful to his ear. My heart and life, my lips and every power Snatch'd from the grasp of death, I here devote By thy bless'd hands an offering to his name. Amen, Hallelujah. [Hail, Hebrew psalmist king! Hail, happy hour!] Hail, Hebrew psalmist king! Hail, happy hour! I see, I hear, I feel the sov'reign pow'r Of language so devout. Th'immortal sound Thrills thro' my vitals with a pleasing wound, And mortal passions die. Devotion reigns, Earth disappears, her mountains and her plains; I soar, I pray, I praise in David's heavenly strains. Here thoughts divine in living words exprest, Pour'd and copy'd glowing from the breast, Spread o'er the sacred page; what eye, what heart, Can read the rapture, and not bear its part In holy elevation? Where love and joy exult, the glorious line Gives the same passions, spreads the fire divine, And kindles all the reader. See him rise On wings of ecstasy, shoot thro' the skies, And mix with angels: Hail, ye choirs above, Where all is holy joy, where all is heav'nly love. If sins review'd in trickling sorrows flow; The page conveys the penitential woe, And strikes the inmost spirit. Conscience hears The words of anguish, and dissolves in tears. Ev'n iron souls relent, and hearts of stone Burst at these mournings, and repeat the groan: God and his power are there. LIII.—AN ELEGY ON SOPHRONIA, WHO DIED OF THE SMALL-POX, 1711. Sophron is introduced speaking.] I Forbear, my friends, forbear, and ask no more, Where all my cheerful airs are fled? Why will ye make me talk my torments o'er? My life, my joy, my comfort's dead. II Deep from my soul, mark how the sobs arise, Hear the long groans that waste my breath, And read the mighty sorrow in my eyes, Lovely Sophronia sleeps in death. III Unkind disease, to veil that rosy face With tumours of a mortal pale, While mortal purples with their dismal grace And double horror spot the veil. IV Uncomely veil, and most unkind disease! Is this Sophronia, once the fair? Are these the features that were born to please? And beauty spread her ensigns there? V I was all love, and she was all delight. Let me run back to seasons past; Ah flow'ry days, when first she charm'd my sight! But roses will not always last. VI Yet still Sophronia pleas'd. Nor time, nor care, Could take her youthful bloom away: Virtue has charms which nothing can impair; Beauty like hers could ne'er decay. VII Grace is a sacred plant of heav'nly birth: The seed descending from above Roots in a soil refin'd, grows high on earth, And blooms with life, and joy and love. VIII Such was Sophronia's soul. Celestial dew, And angels' food were her repast: Devotion was her work; and thence she drew Delights which strangers never taste. IX Not the gay splendors of a flatt'ring court Could tempt her to appear and shine: Her solemn airs forbid the world's resort: But I was blest and she was mine. X Safe on her welfare all my pleasures hung, Her smiles could all my pains control; Her soul was made of softness, and her tongue Was soft and gentle as her soul. XI She was my guide, my friend, my earthly all; Love grew with every waning moon: Had heav'n a length of years delay'd its call, Still I had thought it call'd too soon. XII But peace, my sorrows! Nor with murmuring voice Dare to accuse heav'n's high decree: She was first ripe for everlasting joys; Sophron, she waits above for thee. LIV.—AN ELEGY ON THE MUCH-LAMENTED DEATH OF MRS. ELIZABETH BURY, LATE WIFE OF THE REV. MR. SAMUEL BURY, OF BRISTOL, ANNEXED TO SOME MEMOIRS OF HER LIFE, DRAWN UP BY HIM; BUT COLLECTED OUT OF HER OWN PAPERS. She must ascend; her treasure lies on high, And there her heart is. Bear her thro' the sky On wings of harmony, ye sons of light, And with surrounding shields protect her flight. Teach her the wondrous songs yourselves compose For you bright world; she'll learn 'em as she goes; The sense was known before: Those sacred themes, The God, the Saviour, and the flowing streams That ting'd the cursed tree with blood divine, Purchas'd a heav'n, and wash'd a world from sin; The beams, the bliss, the vision of that face Where the whole godhead shines in mildest grace; These are the notes for which your harps are strung, These were the joy and labour of her tongue In our dark regions. These exalted strains Brought paradise to earth, and sooth'd her pains. ‘Souls made of pious harmony and love, ‘Can be no strangers to their work above.’ But must we lose her hence? The muse in pain Regrets her flight, and calls the saint again. Stay, gentle spirit, stay. Can nature find No charms to hold the once unfetter'd mind? Must all those virtues, all those graces soar Far from our sight, and bless the earth no more? Must the fair saint to worlds immortal climb, For ever lost to all the sons of time? O, no; she is not lost. Behold her here, How just the form! how soft the lines appear! The features of her soul, without disguise, Drawn by her own bless'd pen: a sweet surprise To mourning friends. The partner of her cares Seiz'd the fair piece, and wash'd it o'er with tears, Dress'd it in flow'rs, then hung it on her urn, A pattern for her sex in ages yet unborn. Daughters of Eve, come, trace these heav'nly lines, Feel with what power the bright example shines; She was what you should be. Young virgins, come, Drop a kind tear, and dress you at her tomb: Gay silks and diamonds are a vulgar road; Her radiant virtues should create the mode. Matrons, attend her hearse with thoughts refin'd, Gaze and transcribe the beauties of her mind, And let her live in you. The meek, the great, The chaste, yet free; the cheerful, yet sedate: Swift to forgiveness, but to anger slow, And rich in solid learning more than show, With charity and zeal, that rarely join, And all the human graces and divine, Reign'd in her breast, and held a pleasing strife Thro' every shifting scene of various life, The maid, the bride, the widow, and the wife. Nor need a manly spirit blush to gain Exalted thoughts from her superior vein. Attend her hints, ye sages of the schools, And by her nobler practice frame your rules. Let her inform you to address the ear With conquering suasion, or reproof severe, And still without offence. Thrice happy soul, That could our passions, and her own control; Could wield and govern that unruly train, Sense, fancy, pleasure, fear, grief, hope and pain, And live sublimely good! Behold her move Thro' earth's rude scenes, yet point her thoughts above. ‘Seraphs on earth pant for their native skies, ‘And nature feels it painful not to rise.’ Ye venerable tribes of holy men, Read the devotions of her heart and pen, And learn to pray and die. Burissa knew To make life happy, and resign it too. The soul that oft had walk'd the ethereal road, Pleas'd with her summons, took her farewell flight to God. But ne'er shall words, or lines, or colours paint Th'immortal passions of th'expiring saint. What beams of joy, angelic airs, arise O'er her pale cheeks, and sparkle thro' her eyes In that dark hour! How all serene she lay Beneath the openings of celestial day! Her soul retires from sense, refines from sin, While the descending glory wrought within; Then in a sacred calm resign'd her breath, And as her eyelids clos'd, she smil'd in death. O may some pious friend, who weeping stands Near my last pillow with uplifted hands, Or wipes the mortal dew from off my face, Witness such triumphs in my soul; and trace The dawn of glory in my dying mien, While on my lifeless lips such heav'nly smiles are seen! September 29, 1720. At the Death of that excellent Man Sir Thomas Abney. A SOLILOQUY, OR MOURNING MEDITATION. ‘Quis desiderio sit pudor aut modus ‘Tam chari capitis? Præcipe lugubres ‘Cantus, Melpomene. ‘Ergone Abneium perpetuus sopor ‘Urget? Cui pudor &amp; justitiæ soror ‘Incorrupta fides, nudaque veritas, ‘Quando ullum invenient parem?’ HOR. PART I. His private Life. I Abney expires. A general groan Sounds thro' the house. How must a friend behave Where death and grief have rais'd a throne, And the sad chambers seem th'apartments of the grave? II Shall I appear amongst the chief Of mourners, wailing o'er the dear deceas'd? Or must I seek to charm their grief, And in distress of soul to comfort the distress'd? III I mourn by turns, and comfort too; He that can feel, can ease another's smart: The drops of sympathetic woe Convey the heav'nly cordial warmer to the heart. IV We mourn a thousand joys deceas'd, We name the husband with a mournful tongue; He, when the pow'rs of life decreas'd, Felt the diviner flames of love for ever young. V Thrice happy man! Thrice happy pair! If love could bid approaching death remove, The painful name of widow here Had ever been unknown: But death is deaf to love. VI Albina The Lady Abney. mourns, she mourns alone, Her grief unrivall'd in a house of tears, The partner of her soul is gone, Who doubled all her joys, and half sustain'd her cares. VII See the fair offspring of the dead, With their young griefs Albina they inclose, Beside the father's dying bed; And as her woes increase, their love and duty grows. VIII The children feel the mother's pain, Down their pale cheeks the trickling sorrows roll; The mother sees and weeps again, With all the tender passions struggling in her soul. IX The tender passions reign and spread Thro' the whole house, and to the courts descend: We mourn the best of brothers dead; We mourn the kindest master, and the firmest friend. X We mourn; but not as wretches do, Where vicious lives all hope in death destroy: A falling tear is nature's due; But hope climbs high, and borders on celestial joy. XI There sits the late departed saint; Justum &amp; tenacem propositi virum, &amp;c. Hac arte—Enixus arces attigit igneas. Hor. There dwells the husband, father, brother, friend: Then let us cease the sore complaint, Or mingled with our groans let notes of praise ascend. XII Great God, to thee we raise our song, Thine were the graces that enrich'd his mind; We bless thee, that he shone so long, And left so fair a track of pious life behind. PART II. His public Character and Death. I But can domestic sorrow show A nation's loss? Can private tears suffice To mourn the saint and ruler too, Great names, so rarely join'd below the blissful skies? II Could Abney in our world be born, Could Abney live, and not Britannia smile? Or die, and not Britannia mourn, Cunctis ille bonis flebilis occidit. Hor. When such ethereal worth left our degenerate isle? III 'Twas heav'nly wisdom, zeal divine, Taught him the balance and the sword to hold: His looks with sacred justice shine Beyond the scarlet honours, or the wreathen gold. IV Truth, freedom, courage, prudence stood Attending, when he fill'd the solemn chair: He knew no friendships, birth, nor blood, Nor wealth, nor gay attire, when criminals were there. —Est animus tibi Rerumque prudens, &amp; secundis Temporibus, dubiisque rectus; Vindex avaræ fraudis, &amp; abstinens Ducentis ad se cuncta pecuniæ. —Bonus atque fidus Judex honestum prætulit utili, &amp; Rejecit alto dona nocentium Vultu ? Hor. V He sign'd their doom with steady hand; Yet drops of pity from his eyelids roll: He Qui quærit Pater urbium Subscribi statuis, indomitam audeat Refrenare licentiam, Cædes, &amp; rabiem tollere civium. Hor. punish'd to reform the land, With terror on his brow, and mercy in his soul. VI His tongue was much unskill'd to chide; Soft were his lips, and all his language sweet: His soul disdain'd the airs of pride, Yet love and reverence greet him thro' the crowded street. VII Godlike he lived and acted here, Moving unseen, and still sublimely great; Yet when his country claim'd his care, Descending he appear'd, and bore the pomp of state. VIII He more than once oblig'd the throne, And sav'd the nation; yet he shunn'd the fame, Careless to make his merit known. The christian hath enough, that heav'n records his name. IX His humble soul convers'd on high; Heav'n was his hope, his rest, his native home: His treasures lay above the sky; Much he possess'd on earth, but more in worlds to come. X With silent steps he trac'd the way To the fair courts of light, his wish'd abode; Nor would he ask a moment's stay, Nor make the convoy wait, that call'd his soul to God. XI See the good man with head reclin'd, And peaceful heart, resign his precious breath: No guilty thoughts oppress his mind; Calm and serene his life, serene and calm his death. XII Laden with honours and with years, His vigorous virtue shot a youthful ray; And while he ends his race, appears Bright as the setting-sun of a long cloudless day. XIII Spent with the toil of busy hours, Nature retir'd and life sunk down to sleep: Come, dress the bed with fadeless flow'rs, Come, angels, round his tomb immortal vigils keep. XIV The heart of every Briton rears A monument to Abney's spotless fame; The pencil faints, the muse despairs; His country's grief and love must eternise his name. Sic cecinit mœrens, Inter mœrores domesticos, Et patriæ suæ luctus, I. W. Death and Heaven. In five Lyric Odes. ODE I. The Spirit's Farewell to the Body after long Sickness. I How am I held a prisoner now, Far from my God! This mortal chain Binds me to sorrow: All below Is short-liv'd ease or tiresome pain. II When shall that wondrous hour appear, Which frees me from this dark abode, To live at large in regions, where Nor cloud nor veil shall hide my God? III Farewell this flesh, these ears, these eyes, These snares and fetters of the mind; My God, nor let this frame arise Till every dust be well refin'd. IV Jesus, who mak'st our natures whole, Mould me a body like thy own: Then shall it better serve my soul In works of praise and worlds unknown. ODE II. The Departing Moment; or, Absent from the Body. I Absent from flesh! O blissful thought! What unknown joys this moment brings! Freed from the mischiefs sin hath wrought, From pains, and tears, and all their springs. II Absent from flesh! Illustrious day! Surprising scene! Triumphant stroke, That rends the prison of my clay, And I can feel my fetters broke! III Absent from flesh! Then rise, my soul, Where feet or wings could never climb, Beyond the heav'ns where planets roll, Measuring the cares and joys of time. IV I go where God and glory shine: His presence makes eternal day. My all that's mortal I resign, For Uriel waits and points my way. ODE III. Entrance into Paradise; or, Present with the Lord. I And is this heav'n? And am I there? How short the road! How swift the flight! I am all life, all eye, all ear; Jesus is here,—my soul's delight. II Is this the heav'nly Friend who hung In blood and anguish on the tree, Whom Paul proclaim'd, whom David sung, Who dy'd for them, who dy'd for me? III How fair thou offspring of my God! Thou first-born image of his face! Thy death procur'd this blest abode, Thy vital beams adorn the place. IV Lo, he presents me at the throne All spotless; there the godhead reigns Sublime and peaceful thro' the Son: Awake, my voice, in heav'nly strains. ODE IV. The Sight of God in Heaven. I Creator-God, eternal light, Fountain of good, tremendous power, Ocean of wonders, blissful sight! Beauty and love unknown before! II Thy grace, thy nature, all unknown In yon dark region whence I came; Where languid glimpses from thy throne And feeble whispers teach thy name. III I'm in a world where all is new; Myself, my God; O blest amaze! Not my best hopes or wishes knew To form a shadow of this grace. IV Fix'd on my God, my heart, adore: My restless thoughts, forbear to rove: Ye meaner passions, stir no more; But all my powers be joy and love. ODE V. A Funeral Ode at the Interment of the Body, supposed to be sung by the Mourners. I Unveil thy bosom, faithful tomb; Take this new treasure to thy trust, And give these sacred relics room. To seek a slumber in the dust. II Nor pain, nor grief, nor anxious fear Invade thy bounds. No mortal woes Can reach the lovely sleeper here, And angels watch her soft repose. III So Jesus slept: God's dying Son Past through the grave, and blest the bed. Rest here, fair saint; till from his throne The morning break and pierce the shade. IV Break from his throne, illustrious morn; Attend, O earth, his sov'reign word; Restore thy trust, a glorious form; She must ascend to meet her Lord. LXI.—ON THE CORONATION OF THEIR MAJESTIES KING GEORGE II. AND QUEEN CAROLINE. OCTOBER 11, 1727. The Coronation-Day. An Ode. ‘Ergo armis invicte heros age: Fortibus apta ‘Ensem humeris; meritam clementia temperet iram ‘Dum regis, &amp; leges molli clementer acerbas. ‘Te super æquævos omnes regnator olympi ‘Diligit, &amp; læto vultum exhilaravit olivo; ‘Ille tuum sacro cingit diademate crinem, ‘Transmittetque tuam longæva in sæcula famam. ‘En regina tori consors tibi dextera adhæret, ‘Auro picta sinus, auro radiata capillos; ‘Tota decens, tota est gemmisque insignis &amp; auro: ‘At facies cultum illustrat, facieque decorâ ‘Pulchrior est animus. Buchan. I Rise, happy morn; fair sun, arise; Shed radiant gold around the skies, And rich in beams and blessings shine Profuse on George and Caroline. II Illustrious pair! No tear to-day Bedew the royal parents' clay! 'Tis George the blest remounts the throne, With double vigour in his son. III Lo, the majestic form appears, Sparkling in life and manly years: The kingdom's pride, the nation's choice, And heav'n approves Britannia's voice. IV Monarch, assume thy pow'rs, and stand The guardian-hero of our land: Let Albion's sons thy style proclaim, And distant realms revere thy name. V Bear on thy brows th'imperial crown; Rebellion dies beneath thy frown: A thousand gems of lustre shed Their lights and honours round thy head. VI Lift up thy rod of majesty, The sceptre. The foes of God and man shall flee: Vice with her execrable band Shakes at the sword in George's hand. VII Law, justice, valour, mercy ride In arms of triumph at his side; And each celestial grace is seen In milder glories round the Queen. VIII Hail, royal fair! divinely wise! Not Austrian crowns Archducal and Imperial. could tempt thy eyes To part with truth. 'Twas brave disdain, When Cæsar sigh'd, and lov'd in vain. IX But heav'n provides a rich reward: George is thy lover and thy lord: The British lion bears thy fame, Where Austrian eagles have no name. X See the fair train of princes near: Come, Frederic, royal youth, appear, And grace the day. Shall foreign That ingenious device of the figures of Great Britain and the protestant religion attending her majesty on her coronation medal, with the motto, Hic amor, Hæc patria, may support and justify these expressions. charms Still hold thee from thy country's arms. XI Britain, thy country That ingenious device of the figures of Great Britain and the protestant religion attending her majesty on her coronation medal, with the motto, Hic amor, Hæc patria, may support and justity these expressions.? Prince arise, The morning-star to gild our skies; (O may no cloud thy lustre stain!) Come, lead along the shining train. XII Each in parental virtues dress'd, Each born to make a nation bless'd: What kings, what heroes yet ungrown, Shall court the nymphs to grace their throne! XIII Mark that young branch Prince William. of rising fame, Proud of our great deliverer's name: He promises in infant bloom, To scourge some tyrant-power of Rome. XIV Bloom on, fair stem! Each flow'r that blows, Adds new despair to Albion's foes, And kills their hearts. O glorious view Of joys for Albion, ever new! XV Religion, duty, truth and love, In ranks of honours shine and move; Pale envy, slander, fraud and spite, Retire, and hide in caves of night. XVI Europe, behold th'amazing scene: Empire and liberty convene To join their joys and wishes here, While Rome and hell consent to fear. XVII Eternal God, whose boundless sway Angels and starry worlds obey, Command thy choicest favours down, Where thy own hands have fix'd the crown. XVIII Come, light divine, and grace unknown, Come, aid the labours of the throne: Let Britain's golden ages run In circles lasting as the sun. XIX Bid some bright legion from the sky Assist the glad solemnity: Ye hosts, that wait on favourite kings, Wave your broad swords, and clap your wings. XX Then rise, and to your realms convey The glorious tidings of the day: Great William shall rejoice to know, That George the second reigns below. LXII.—A LOYAL WISH ON HER MAJESTY'S BIRTH-DAY, MARCH 1, COMMONLY CALLED ST. DAVID'S DAY. Borrowed from Psalm cxxxii. 10, 11. I Silence, ye nations; Israel, hear: Thus hath the Lord to David sworn, ‘Train up thy sons to learn my fear, ‘And Judah's crown shall all thy race adorn; ‘Theirs by the royal honours thou hast won, ‘Long as the starry wheels of nature run; ‘Nature, be thou my pledge; my witness be the sun.’ II Now, Britain, let thy vows arise, May George the royal saint assume! Then ask permission of the skies, To put the favourite name in David's room: Fair Carolina, join thy pious cares To train in virtue's path your royal heirs, And be the British crown with endless honour theirs. LXIII.—PIETY IN A COURT. TO PHILOMELA. Is there a lovely soul, so much divine, Can act her glorious part, and move and shine On this enchanted spot of treach'rous ground, Nor give her virtue nor her fame a wound? Is there a soul so temper'd, so refin'd, That pomp nor feeds her sense, nor fires the mind, That soars above the globe with high disdain, While earth's gay trifles tempt her thoughts in vain? Is there a soul can fix her raptur'd eyes, And glance warm wishes at her kindred skies Thro' roofs of vaulted gold, while round her burn Love's wanton fires, and die beneath her scorn? Is there a soul at court that seeks the grove Or lonely hill to muse on heav'nly love; And when to crowds and state her hour descends, She keeps her conscience and her God her friends? Have ye not met her, angels, in her flight, Wing'd with devotion, thro' meridian night, Near heav'ns high portal?—Angels, speak her name, Consign Eusebia to celestial fame: While Philomel in language like your own To mortal ears makes her young vict'ries known; Let Raphael to the skies her honours sing, And triumphs daily new. With friendly wing Gabriel in arms attend her thro' the field Of sacred war, and mercy be her shield, While with unsully'd charms she makes her way Thro' scenes of dangerous life, to realms of endless day. 1. A Rural Meditation. Here in the tuneful groves and flow'ry fields, Nature a thousand various beauties yields: The daisy and tall cowslip we behold Array'd in snowy white, or freckled gold. The verdant prospect cherishes our sight, Affording joy unmix'd, and calm delight; The forest-walks and venerable shade, Wide-spreading lawns, bright rills, and silent glade, With a religious awe our souls inspire, And to the heav'ns our raptur'd thoughts aspire, To him who sits in majesty on high, Who turn'd the starry arches of the sky; Whose word ordain'd the silver Thames to flow, Rais'd all the hills, and laid the vallies low; Who taught the nightingale in shades to sing, And bid the sky-lark warble on the wing; Makes the young steer obedient till the land, And lowing heifers own the milker's hand; Calms the rough sea, and stills the raging wind, And rules the passions of the human mind. 2. A Penitential Thought. Can I then grieve for ev'ry wretch's woe, And weep if I but hear a tale of sorrow? Say, can I share in ev'ry one's affection, Yet still remain thus stupid to my own? Is then my heart to all the world beside Softer than melting wax or summer snow, But to myself harder than adamant? Can I behold the ruin Sin has made, And feel God's image in my soul defac'd; Nor heave a sigh, nor drop a pitying tear At my sad fate, nor lift my eyes to heav'n For aid against the flatt'ries of the world, The wiles of Satan and the joys of sense? Give me, ye springs, O give me all your streams That I may weep; nor thus with stupid gaze Behold my ruin, like a wretch inchanted Whose faculties are bound with pow'rful charms, To some accursed spot of earth confin'd. Give me, ye gentle winds, your balmy breath To heave my bosom with continued sighs.— Teach me, ye wood-doves, your complaining note, To mourn my fall, to mourn my rocky heart, My headstrong will, and every sinful thought. In silent shades retir'd I long to dwell, Far from the tumults of the busy world, And all the sounds of mirth and clamorous joy, Till every stormy passion is subdu'd, And God has full possession of my soul; Till all my wishes centre in his will, And I no more am fetter'd to the world; Till all the business of my life is praise, And my full heart o'erflows with heav'nly love, While all created beauties lose their charms, And God is all in all. 3. A Midnight Hymn. To thee, all glorious, ever blessed Pow'r, I consecrate this silent midnight hour, While solemn darkness covers o'er the sky, And all things wrapp'd in gentle slumbers lie, Unwearied let me praise thy holy name, And ev'ry thought with gratitude inflame, For the rich mercies which thy hands impart, Health to my flesh, and comfort to my heart. O may my prayers before thy throne arise, An humble but accepted sacrifice! And when thou shalt my weary eyelids close, And to my body grant a soft repose, May my ethereal guardian kindly spread His wings, and from the tempter screen my head! Grant of celestial light some piercing beams, To bless my sleep and sanctify my dreams. 4. The dying Christian's Hope. When faint and sinking to the shades of death, I gasp with pain for ev'ry lab'ring breath, O may my soul by some blest foretaste know That she's deliver'd from eternal woe! May hope in Christ dispel each gloomy fear, And thoughts like these my drooping spirits cheer. What tho' my sins are of a crimson stain, My Saviour's blood can wash me white again: Tho' numerous as the twinkling stars they be, Or sands along the margin of the sea; Or as smooth pebbles on some beachy shore, The mercies of th'Almighty still are more: He looks upon my soul with pitying eyes, Sees all my fears, and listens to my cries: He knows the frailty of each human breast, What passions our unguarded hearts molest, And for the sake of his dear dying Son Will pardon all the ills that I have done. Arm'd with so bright a hope, I shall not fear To see my death hourly approach more near; But my faith strength'ning as my life decays, My dying breath shall mount to heav'n in praise. LXVI.—FRAGMENTS OF VERSE. 1. The Preface of a Letter, written August, 1692. E'er since the morning of that day Which bid my dearest friends adieu, And rolling wheels bore me away Far from my native town and you, E'er since I lost through distant place, The pleasures of a parent's face, This is the first whose language sues For your release from waxen bands; Laden with humble love it bows To kiss a welcome from your hands: Accept the duty which it brings, And pardon its delaying wings. 2. The Sun in Eclipse.—To Horatio. Now, now 'tis just at hand— Now the bright sun leaves his meridian stage, Rolls down the hill, and meets his sister's rage; Her gloomy wheels full at his chariot run, And join fierce combat with her brother sun. The gentle monarch of the azure plain Still paints and silvers her rebellious wain, And shoots his wonted fires, but shoots his fires in vain. Th'ungrateful planet does as fast requite Th'o'erflowing measures of her borrow'd light With an impetuous deluge of her resistless night. His flaming coursers toss their raging heads, And heave and grapple with the stubborn shades; Their eyeballs flash, their brazen bellows puff, And belch ethereal fire to guard the darkness off; In vain their brazen lungs, in vain their eyes, Night spreads her banners o'er the wond'ring skies. Say, peaceful muse, what fury did excite The kindred stars to this prodigious fight? Are these the rules of nature? Will the skies Let such dark scenes of dreadful battle rise? What dire events hang threat'ning o'er the earth? What plagues, what wars, just bursting into birth? Now for his teeming glebe the ploughman fears, Lest it should yield a crop of iron spears: Shepherds see death spread o'er the fleecy downs, Monarchs grow pale, and tremble for their crowns: Vain dreams of mortal weakness! Awake, Philosophy, with radiant eye, Who searcheth all that's deep, and all that's high; Awake, survey the spheres, explain the laws Of heav'n, and bring to light th'eternal cause Of present darkness, &amp;c. Southampton, June, 1695. 3. In a Letter to Marinda, speaking concerning our blessed Saviour. Let your immortal thoughts arise, Survey him crown'd with every grace, Jesus, the wonder of the skies, The great, the meek, the lovely and the wise, The joy and glory of the place. Here angels fix their gazing sight, Here saints releas'd from earth and sin, Dwell on his face divinely bright, Copy his beauties with intense delight, And with advancing lustre shine. LXVII.—THE INSCRIPTIONS ON SEVERAL SMALL FRENCH PICTURES, TRANSLATED. Angelica singing. What, music and devotion too? This is the business angels do: When hearts, and hymns, and voices join, It makes the pleasant work divine. Chloris stringing of Pearls. Virtue and truth in heart and head, Which teach you how to act and speak, Are brighter pearls than those you thread, Chloris, to tie about your neck. Phyllis playing with a Parrot. If women will not be inclin'd To seek th'improvements of the mind, Believe me, Phyllis, for 'tis true, Parrots will talk as well as you. Claudina the Cook-maid. The cook, who in her humble post Provides the family with food, Excels those empty dames that boast Of charms and lovers, birth and blood. Florella singing to her Harp. Florella sings and plays so well, Which she doth best is hard to tell; But 'tis a poor account to say, All she can do is sing and play. Amaryllis spinning. O what a pretty spinner's here! How sweet her looks! How neat her linen! If love and youth came both to see her, Youth wou'd at once set love a spinning. Dorinda sewing. We stand expos'd to every sin While idle, and without employ; But business holds our passions in, And keeps out all unlawful joy. Iris suckling three Lap-dogs. Fond foolish woman! While you nurse Those puppies at your breast, Your name and credit fares the worse For every drop they taste. Iris, for shame, those brutes remove, And better learn to place your love. Pomona the Market-maid. Virtue adorns her soul within, Her homely garb is ever clean: Such innocence disdaining art Gives love an honourable dart. LXVIII.—INSCRIPTIONS ON DIALS. Written on a Sun-dial in a Circle. Afterwards turned into English. Thus steal the silent hours away, The sun thus hastes to reach the sea, And men to mingle with their clay. Thus light and shade divide the year, Thus, till the last great day appear, And shut the starry theatre. Another. So slide the hours, so wears the day, These moments, measure life away With all its trains of hope and fear, Till shifting scenes of shade and light Rise to eternal day, or sink in endless night, Where all is joy or all despair. On a Ceiling-dial, usually called a Spot-dial, made at a western Window at Theobalds. Little sun upon the ceiling, Ever moving, ever stealing Moments, minutes, hours away; May no shade forbid thy shining, While the heav'nly sun declining, Calls us to improve the day. Another for a Spot-dial. Shining spot, but ever sliding! Brightest hours have no abiding: Use the golden moments well: Life is wasting, Death is hasting, Death consigns to heav'n or hell. Another. See the little day-star moving; Life and time are worth improving, Seize the moments while they stay; Seize and use them, Lest you lose them, And lament the wasted day. LXVIII.—INSCRIPTIONS ON PORTRAITS. The Lines under Dr. Owen's Picture, written by himself. Englished thus: Behold the shade, the frail remains Of sickness, cares, and studious pains. The mind in humble posture waits At sacred Truth's celestial gates, And keeps those bounds with holy fear, While he who gave it, sees it there. Various Mottos for an Effigy. 3. [Seeking the things above] Seeking the things above, And speaking truth and love. LXX.—EPIGRAMS. 2. On the wondrous Rise of the South-Sea Stock, 1720. 'Tis said the citizens have sold Faith, truth and trade, for South-Sea gold: 'Tis false; for those that know can swear ‘All is not gold that glisters there.’ 4. Sabina and her Companions travelling together to see fine Buildings and Gardens. While round the gardens and the groves Your foot, your eye, your fancy roves, With still new forms of pleasure in a warm pursuit, Let every tree yield knowledge too, Safer than that in Eden grew, Where your own mother Eve found poison in the fruit. 5. The same. [Go, view the dwellings of the great] Go, view the dwellings of the great, The spacious court, the tow'ring seat, The roofs of costly form, the fret-work and the gold; Mark the bright tap'stry scenes, and say, Will these make wrinkled age delay, Or warm the cheek, and paint it gay, When death spreads o'er the face her frightful pale and cold? 6. The same. [In vain to search the verdant scenes] In vain to search the verdant scenes, The shaded walks, the flow'ry greens, The trees of golden fruit for what can ne'er be found: You search for bliss where 'twill not grow, There is no paradise below, Since life's immortal tree is perish'd from the ground. LXXI.—EPITAPHS. 1. An Inscription on a Monumental Stone in Chessunt Church, in Hertfordshire. In Memory of Thomas Pickard, Esq. Citizen of London, who died suddenly, Jan. 29, A.D. 1719. Æt. 50. A soul prepar'd needs no delays, The summons come, the saint obeys: Swift was his flight, and short the road, He clos'd his eyes, and saw his God. The flesh rests here till Jesus come, And claims the treasure from the tomb. 2. On the Grave-stone of Mr. John May, a young Student in Divinity, who died after a lingering and painful Sickness, and was buried in Chessunt Church-yard, in Hertfordshire. So sleep the saints, and cease to groan, When sin and death have done their worst. Christ hath a glory like his own, Which waits to clothe their waking dust. 3. Written for a Grave-stone of a near Relation. In faith she died; in dust she lies; But faith foresees that dust shall rise When Jesus calls, while hope assumes And boasts her joy among the tombs. Or thus Beneath this stone death's prisoner lies, The stone shall move, the prisoner rise, When Jesus with almighty word Calls his dead saints to meet their Lord. 4. To the pious Memory of the Reverend Mr. Samuel Harvey of London, who died April 17, 1729. Æt. 30. An Epitaph. He was a person of a very low stature, but of an excellent spirit, adorned with all the graces of a minister and a christian in a most uncommon degree. His sickness was a slow fever; but while the disorder was upon him, he ventured abroad, according to a promise made some time before, and his zeal exhausted all his spirits in pious and profitable conversation with some younger persons who greatly valued his ministry; in a few days the distemper prevailed beyond the reach and power of medicine. Here lie the ruins of a lowly tent, Where the seraphic soul of Harvey spent Its mortal years. How did his genius shine, Like heav'n's bright envoy, clad in pow'rs divine! When from his lips the grace or vengeance broke, 'Twas majesty in arms, 'twas melting mercy spoke. What worlds of worth lay crowded in that breast! Too strait the mansion for th'illustrious guest. Zeal, like a flame shot from the realms of day, Aids the slow fever to consume the clay, And bears the saint up through the starry road Triumphant. So Elijah went to God. What happy prophet shall his mantle find, Heir to the double portion of his mind? Sic musâ jam veterascenti Inter justissimos amicorum &amp; ecclesiæ Fletus Harvæo suo parentat. I. W. 5. An Epitaph on the Reverend Mr. Matthew Clarke. In English thus: Sacred to memory. In this sepulchre lies buried MATTHEW CLARKE, A son bearing the name of his venerable father, nor less venerable himself: Train'd up from his youngest years in sacred and human learning: Very skilful in the languages: In the gift of preaching excellent, laborious and successful: In the pastoral office faithful and vigilant: Among the controversies of divines moderate always and pacific: Ever ready for all the duties of piety: Among husbands, brothers, fathers, friends, he had few equals: And his carriage toward all mankind was eminently benevolent. But what rich stores of grace lay hid behind The veil of modesty, no human mind Can search, no friend declare, nor fame reveal, Nor has this mournful marble power to tell. Yet there's a hast'ning hour, it comes, it comes, To rouse the sleeping dead, to burst the tombs And set the saint in view. All eyes behold: While the vast records of the skies unroll'd, Rehearse his works, and spread his worth abroad; The Judge approves, and heav'n and earth applaud. Go, traveller; and wheresoe'er Thy wand'ring feet shall rest In distant lands, thy ear shall hear His name pronounc'd and blest. He was born in Leicestershire, in the year 1664. He died at London, March 27, 1726, Aged sixty-two years, Much beloved and much lamented. 6. An Epitaph on the Reverend Mr. Edward Brodhurst. Done into English by another hand. This marble calls to our remembrance A person of superior skill in divinity, Nor less acquainted with human literature: Inclined from his infancy to things sacred, An impartial enquirer after truth, An able defender of the christian faith, A truly pious and devout man. A preacher that excelled In force of reason and art of persuasion: A pastor vigilant beyond his strength Over the flock committed to his charge: Of courteous behaviour and beneficent life: A pattern of charity in all its branches: A man adorn'd with many virtues, Conceal'd under a veil of modesty; But shall not for ever be concealed. Go, reader, expect the day, When heaven and earth at once shall know How deserving a person Mr. EDWARD BRODHURST was. He was born in Derbyshire, 1691. Dy'd at Birmingham, July 21, 1730. His soul ascending to the blest above, The church on earth bemoans, The church triumphant congratulates, Is received by Christ, approved of God; ‘Well done, good and faithful servant.’ LXXIV.—A DYING WORLD, AND A DURABLE HEAVEN. All born on earth must die. Destruction reigns Round the whole globe, and changes all its scenes. Time brushes off our lives with sweeping wing: But heav'n defies its power. There angels sing Immortal. To that world direct thy sight, My soul, ethereal-born, and thither aim thy flight: There virtue finds reward; eternal joy, Unknown on earth, shall the full soul employ. This glebe of death we tread, these shining skies, Hold out the moral lesson to our eyes. The sun still travels his illustrious round, While ages bury ages under ground: While heroes sink forgotten in their urns, Still Phosphor The morning-star and the dog-star. glitters, and still Syrius burns. Light reigns thro' worlds above, and life with all her springs: Yet man lies grov'ling on the earth, The soul forgets its heav'nly birth, Nor mourns her exile thence, nor homeward tries her wings. [When death and everlasting things] I When death and everlasting things Approach and strike the sight, The soul unfolds itself, and brings Its hidden thoughts to light. II The silent christian speaks for God, With courage owns his name, And spreads the Saviour's grace abroad: The zeal subdues the shame. III Lord, shall my soul again conceal Her faith, if doth retire? Shall shame subdue the lively zeal, And quench th'ethereal fire? IV O may my thoughts for ever keep The grave and heav'n in view, Lest if my zeal and courage sleep, My lips grow silent too! LXXV.—THE REWARDS OF POESY. Damon, Thalia, Urania. DAMON. Muse, 'tis enough that in the fairy bow'rs My youth has lost a thousand sprightly hours, Attending thy vagaries, in pursuit Of painted blossoms or inchanted fruit. Forbear to teize my riper age: 'Tis hard To be a slave so long, and find so small reward. THALIA. Man, 'tis enough that in the books of fame On brazen leaves the muse shall write thy name, Illustrious as her own, and make thy years the same. Fame with her silver trump shall spread the sound Of Damon's verse, wide as the distant bound Of British empire, or the world's vast round. I see, I see from far the falling oars, And flying sails that bear to western shores Thy shining name; it shoots from sea to sea; Envy pursues, but faints amidst the way. In vision my prophetic tube descries Behind five hundred years new ages rise, Who read thy works with rapture in their eyes. Cities unbuilt shall bless the lyric bard. O glorious memory! O immense reward! DAMON. Ah flatt'ring muse! How fruitless and how fair These visionary scenes and sounding air? Fruitless and vain to me! Can noisy breath Or fame's loud trumpet reach the courts of death? I shall be stretch'd upon my earthy bed, Unthinking dust, nor know the honours paid To my surviving song. Thalia, say, Have I no more to hope? Hast thou no more to pay? THALIA. Say, what had Horace, what had Homer more, My favourite sons, whom men almost adore; And youth in learned ranks for ever sings, While perish'd heroes and forgotten kings Have lost their names? 'Tis sov'reign wit has bought This deathless glory: This the wise have thought Prodigious recompence— DAMON. —Prodigious fools, To think the hum and buz of paltry schools, And awkward tones of boys are prizes meet For Roman harmony and Grecian wit! Rise from thy long repose, old Homer's ghost! Horace arise! Are these the palms you boast For your victorious verse? Great poets, tell, Can echos of a name reward you well, For labours so sublime? Or have you found Praise make your slumbers sweeter in the ground? THALIA. Yes, their sweet slumbers, guarded by my wing, Are lull'd and soften'd by th'eternal spring Of bubbling praises from th'Aonian hill, Whose branching streams divide a silver rill To every kindred urn: And thine shall share These purling blessings under hallow'd air: The poets' dreams in death are still the muse's care. DAMON. Once, thou fair tempter of my heedless youth, Once and by chance thy tropes have hit the truth; Praise is but empty air, a purling stream, Poets are paid with bubbles in a dream. Hast thou no songs to entertain thy dead? No phantom-lights to glimmer round my shade? THALIA. Believe me, mortal, where thy relics sleep, My nightingales shall tuneful vigils keep, And cheer thy silent tomb: The glow-worm shine With evening lamp, to mark which earth is thine: While midnight fairies tripping round thy bed, Collect a moon-beam glory for thy head. Fair hyacinths thy hilloc shall adorn, And living ivy creep about thy urn: Sweet violets scent the ground, while laurels throw Their leafy shade o'er the green turf below, And borrow life from thee to crown some poet's brow. DAMON. Muse, thy last blessings sink below the first; Ah wretched trifler! To array my dust In thy green flow'ry forms, and think the payment just! Poor is my gain should nations join to praise; And now must chirping birds reward my lays? What! shall the travels of my soul be paid With glow-worm light, and with a leafy shade, Violets and creeping ivies? Is this all The muse can promise, or the poet call His glorious hope and joy?— Are these the honours of thy favourite sons, To have their flesh, their limbs, their mould'ring bones Fatten the glebe to make a laurel grow, Which the foul carcase of a dog might do, Or any vile manure? Away, be gone; Tempt me no more: I now renounce thy throne: My indignation swells. Here, fetch me fire, Bring me my odes, the labours of the lyre; I doom them all to ashes.— URANIA. Rash man, restrain thy wrath, these odes are mine; Small is thy right in gifts so much divine. Was it thy skill that to a Saviour's name Strung David's harp, and drew th'illustrious theme From smoking altars and a bleeding Lamb? Who form'd thy sounding shell? Who fix'd the strings, Or taught thy hand to play eternal things? Was't not my aid that rais'd thy notes so high? And they must live till time and nature die. Here heav'n and virtue reign: Here joy and love Tune the retir'd devotion of the grove, And train up mortals for the thrones above. Sinners shall start, and, struck with dread divine, Shrink from the vengeance of some flaming line, Shall melt in trickling woes for follies past; Yet all amidst their piercing sorrows taste The sweets of pious hope: Emanuel's blood Flows in the verse, and seals the pardon good. Salvation triumphs here, and heals the smart Of wounded conscience and a breaking heart. Youth shall learn temp'rance from these hallow'd strains, Shall bind their passions in harmonious chains; And virgins learn to love with cautious fear, Nor virtue needs her guard of blushes here. Matrons, grown reverend in their silver hairs, Sooth the sad memory of their ancient cares With these soft hymns; while on their trembling knee Sits their young offspring of the fourth degree With list'ning wonder, till their infant tongue Stammers and lisps, and learns th'immortal song, And lays up the fair lesson to repeat To the fourth distant age, when sitting round their feet. Each heav'n-born heart shall choose a favourite ode To bear their morning homage to their God, And pay their nightly vows. These sacred themes Inspire the pillow with ethereal dreams: And oft amidst the burdens of the day Some devout couplet wings the soul away, Forgetful of this globe: Adieu, the cares Of mortal life! Adieu, the sins, the snares! She talks with angels, and walks o'er the stars. Amidst th'exalted raptures of the lyre O'erwhelm'd with bliss, shall aged saints expire, And mix their notes at once with some celestial choir. DAMON. What holy sounds are these? What strains divine? Is it thy voice, O blest Urania, thine? Enough: I claim no more. My toils are paid, My midnight-lamp, and my o'er-labour'd head, My early sighs for thy propitious pow'r, And my wing'd zeal to seize the lyric hour: Thy words reward them all. And when I die, May the great Ruler of the rolling sky Give thy predictions birth, with blessings from his eye. I lay my flesh to rest, with heart resign'd And smiling hope. Arise, my deathless mind, Ascend, where all the blissful passions flow In sweeter numbers; and let mortals know, Urania leaves these odes to cheer their toils below.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">REMNANTS OF TIME EMPLOYED, IN PROSE AND VERSE; OR, SHORT ESSAYS AND COMPOSURES ON VARIOUS SUBJECTS. IV.—THE BRITISH FISHERMAN. I Let Spain's proud traders, when the mast Bends groaning to the stormy blast, Run to their beads with wretched plaints, And vow and bargain with their saints, Lest Turkish silks or Tyrian wares Sink in the drowning ship, Or the rich dust Peru prepares, Defraud their long projecting cares, And add new treasures to the greedy deep. II My little skiff, that skims the shores, With half a sail and two short oars, Provides me food in gentler waves: But if they gape in watery graves, I trust th'eternal power, whose hand Has swell'd the storm so high, To waft my boat and me to land, Or give some angel swift command To bear the drowning sailor to the sky. V.—REDEMPTION. I The mighty frame of glorious grace, That brightest monument of praise That e'er the God of love design'd, Employs and fills my labouring mind. II Begin, my muse, the heav'nly song, A burden for an angel's tongue: When Gabriel sounds these awful things, He tunes and summons all his strings. III Proclaim inimitable love: Jesus, the Lord of worlds above, Puts off the beams of bright array, And veils the God in mortal clay. IV What black reproach defil'd his name, When with our sin he took our shame! The pow'r whom kneeling angels blest Is made the impious rabble's jest. V He that distributes crowns and thrones Hangs on a tree and bleeds and groans: The Prince of life resigns his breath, The King of glory bows to death. VI But see the wonders of his pow'r, He triumphs in his dying hour, And whilst by Satan's rage he fell He dash'd the rising hopes of hell. VII Thus were the hosts of death subdu'd, And sin was drown'd in Jesus' blood: Then he arose, and reigns above, And conquers sinners by his love. [VIII] Who shall fulfil this boundless song? What vain pretender dares? The theme surmounts an angel's tongue, And Gabriel's harp despairs. In this ode there are three or four lines taken from Mr Stennet's Sacramental Hymns; for when I found they expressed my thought and design in proper and beautiful language, I chose rather to borrow and to acknowledge the debt, than to labour hard for worse lines that I might have the poor pleasure of calling them my own. VI. COMPLAINT AND HOPE UNDER GREAT PAIN. 1736. I Lord, I am pain'd; but I resign To thy superior will: 'Tis grace, 'tis wisdom all divine, Appoints the pains I feel. II Dark are thy ways of providence, While those that love thee groan: Thy reasons lie conceal'd from sense, Mysterious and unknown. III Yet nature may have leave to speak, And plead before her God, Lest the o'er-burden'd heart should break Beneath thy heavy rod. IV Will nothing but such daily pain Secure my soul from hell? Canst thou not make my health attain Thy kind designs as well? V How shall my tongue proclaim thy grace While thus at home confin'd? What can I write, while painful flesh Hangs heavy on the mind? VI These groans and sighs and flowing tears Give my poor spirit ease, While every groan my Father hears, And every tear he sees. VII Is not some smiling hour at hand With peace upon its wings? Give it, O God, thy swift command, With all the joys it brings. VII.—ON AN ELEGY WRITTEN BY THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE COUNTESS OF HERTFORD, ON THE DEATH OF MRS. ROWE. 1737. Struck with the sight of Philomela's urn Eusebia weeps, and calls her muse to mourn: While from her lips the tuneful sorrows fell The groves confess a rising Philomel. VIII.—DR. YOUNG'S ADMIRABLE DESCRIPTION OF THE PEACOCK ENLARGED. View next the peacock: What bright glories run From plume to plume, and vary in the sun? Proudly he boasts them to the heav'nly ray, Gives all his colours, and adorns the day. Was it thy pencil, Job, divinely bold, Drest his rich form in azure, green and gold? Thy hand his crest with starry radiance crown'd, Or spread his sweepy train? His train disdains the ground, And kindles living lamps thro' all the spacious round. Mark with what conscious state the bird displays His native gems, and 'midst the waving blaze On the slow step of majesty he moves, Asserts his honours, and demands his loves.</field>
