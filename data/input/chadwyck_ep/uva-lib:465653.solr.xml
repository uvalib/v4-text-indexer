      <field name="fulltext">AJAX's Speech TO THE GRECIAN KNABBS. The wight an' doughty Captains a' Upo their doups sat down; A rangel o' the common fouk In bourachs a' stood roun. Ajax bangs up, fase targe was shught In seven fald o' hide; An' bein bouden'd up wi' wraith, Wi' atry face he ey'd The Trojan shore, an' a' the barks That tedder'd fast did ly Alang the coast; an' raxing out His gardies, loud did cry: O Jove! The cause we here do plead, An' unco great's the staik; Bat sall that sleeth Ulysses now Be said to be my maik? Ye ken right well, fan Hector try'd Thir barks to burn an' scowder, He took to speed o' fit, because He cou'd na' bide the ewder. Bat I, like birky, stood the brunt, An' slocken'd out that gleed, Wi' muckle virr, an' syne I gar'd The limmers tak the speed. 'Tis better than, the cause we try Wi' the wind o' our wame, Than for to come in hanny grips At sik a driry time. At threeps I am na' sae perquire, Nor auld-farren as he, Bat at banes-brakin, it's well ken[illeg.], He has na' maughts like me. For as far as I him excel In toulzies fierce an' strong, As far in chaft-taak he exceeds Me, wi' his sleeked tongue. My proticks an' my doughty deeds, O Greeks! I need na' tell, For ther's nane here bat kens them well: Lat him tell his himsel: Which ay war done at glomin time, Or dead hour o' the night, An' deil ane kens except himsel; For nae man saw the sight. The staik indeed is unco great, I will confess alway, Bat, name Ulysses to it anes, The worth quite dwines away. Great as it is, I need na' voust; I'm seer I hae nae neef To get fat cou'd be ettl'd at, By sik a mensless thief. Yet routh o' honour he has got, Ev'n tho he gets the glaik, [illeg.]an he's sae crous, that he wou'd try To be brave Ajax' maik. But gin my wightness doubted war, I wat my gentle bleed, As being sin to Telamon, Right sickerly does plead: Fa, under doughty Hercules, Great Troy's walls down hurl'd, An' in a tight Thessalian bark To Colchos' harbour swirl'd. An' Æacus my gutcher was, Fa now in hell sits jidge, Fare a fun-stane does Sisyphus Down to the yerd sair gnidge. Great Jove himsel owns Æacus To be his ain dear boy, An' syne, without a' doubt, I am The neist chiel to his oye. Bat thus in counting o' my etion I need na' mak sik din, For it's well kent Achilles was My father's brither sin: An' as we're cousins, there's nae scouth, To be in ony swidders; I only seek fat is my due, I mean fat was my brither's. Bat why a thief, like Sisyphus, That's nidder'd sae in hell, Sud here tak fittininment, Is mair na' I can tell. Sall then these arms be deny'd To me, fa in this bruilzie Was the first man that drew my durk, Came flaught-bred to the toulzie? An' sall this sleeth come farrer ben, Fa was sae dev'lish surly, He scarce wou'd gae a fit frae hame, An' o' us a' was hurly? An' frae the weir he did back hap, An' turn'd to us his fud; An' gar'd the hale-ware o' us trow That he was gane clean wod. Until the sin o' Nauplius, Mair useless na' himsel, His jouckry-pauckry finding out, To weir did him compel. Lat him than now tak will an' wile, Fa nane at first wou'd wear, An' I get baith the skaith an' scorn, Twin'd o' my brither's gear! Because I was the foremaist man, An' steed the hettest fire, Just like the man that aught the cow, Gade deepest i' the mire. I wish the chiel he had been wod, Or that it had been trow'd; That mither o' mischief had not To Troy's town been row'd. Syne Pæan's son, thou'd not been left On Lemnos' isle to skirle, Fare now thy granes in dowy dens The yerd-fast stanes do thirle: An' on that sleeth Ulysses' head Sad curses down does bicker, If there be gods aboon, I'm seer He'll get them leel and sicker. This doughty lad he was resolv'd Wi' me his fate to try, Wi' poison'd stewgs o' Hercules, Bat 'las! his bleed wis fey. Wi' sickness now he's ferter like, Or like a water-wraith, An' hirplin after the wil birds, Can scarce get meat an' claith. An' now these darts that weerded were To tak the town o' Troy, To get meat for his gabb, he man Against the birds employ. Yet he's alive, altho to gang Wi' him he was fu' laith; If Palamede had been sae wise, He had been free frae skaith: For he'd been livin ti' this day, An' slept in a hale skin, An' gotten fair play for his life, An' stan'd he had nae been. Because he prov'd he was nae wod, He was sae fu' o' fraud, He slack'd na' till he gat the life O' this poor sakeless lad. For to the Grecians he did swear, He had sae great envy, That goud in goupens he had got, The army to betray. An' wi' mischief he was sae gnib, To get his ill intent, He howk'd the goud which he himsel Had yerded in his tent. Thus wi' uncanny pranks he fights, An' sae he did beguile, An' twin'd us o' our kneefest men, By death and by exile. Altho' mair gabby he may be Than Nestor wise and true, Yet few will say, it was nae fau't That he did him furhow. Fan his poor glyde was sae mischiev'd, He'd neither ca' nor drive, The lyart lad, wi' years sair dwang'd, The traitor thief did leave. These are nae threeps o' mine, right well Kens Diomede the wight, Fa' wi' snell words him sair did snib, An' bann'd his cowardly flight. The gods tho look on mortal men Wi' eyn baith just and gleg; Lo he, fa Nestor wou'd nae help, For help himsel does beg! Than as he did the auld man leave Amon' sae fierce a menzie, The law he made, lat him be paid Back just in his ain cuinzie. Yet fan he cry'd, O neipers help! I ran to tak his part, He look'd sae haw as gin a dwame Had just o'ercast his heart. For they had gi'en him sik a fleg, He look'd as he'd been doited, For ilka' limb an' lith o' him 'Gainst ane anithir knoited. Syne wi' my targe I cover'd him, Fan on the yerd he lies, An' sav'd his smeerless saul, I think, 'Tis little to my praise. Bat gin wi' Batie ye will bourd, Come back, lad, to yon place; Lat Trojans an' your wonted fears Stand glourin i' your face: Syne slouch behind my doughty targe, That yon day your head happit; There fight your fill, sin' ye are grown Sae unco crous an' cappit. Fan I came to him, wi' sad wound He had nae maughts to gang, Bat fan he saw that he was safe, Right souple cou'd he spang. Lo! Hector to the toulzie came, An' gods baith fierce an' grim, He flegged starker fouk na' you, Sae sair they dreaded him. Yet as he did o' slaughter voust, I len'd him sik a dird, As laid him arselins on his back, To wamble o' the yerd. Fan he spang'd out, rampag'd an' said That nane amon' us a' Durst venture out upo the lone, Wi' him to shak a fa'; I dacker'd wi' him by mysel, Ye wish't it to my kavel, An' gin ye speer fa got the day, We parted on a nevel. Lo! Trojans fetch baith fire an' sword Amo' the Grecian barks: Fare's eloquent Ulysses now, Wi' a' his wily cracks? I than a thousand ships did save, An' muckle danger thol'd; 'Gin they' ad brunt, deil ane had seen The land fare he was foal'd. Bat gin the truth I now durst tell, I think the honour's mair To them, than fat it is to me, Tho' they come to my skair: At least the honour equal is; Than fat needs a' this din; For Ajax them he does na' seek, Sae sair as they do him. Than lat Ulysses now compare Rhæsus an' maughtless Dolon, An' Priam's son, an' Pallas phizz That i' the night was stoln. For deil be-licket has he done, Fan it was fair-fuir days; Nor without gaucy Diomede, Fa was his guide always. Rather na' gi' him this propine, For deeds that feckless are, Divide them, and lat Diomede Come in for the best share. Bat fat use will they be to him, Fa in hudge mudge wi' wiles, Without a gully in his hand, The smeerless fae beguiles? The gouden helmet will sae glance, An blink wi' skyrin brinns, That a' his wimples they'll find out Fan i' the mark he sheens. Bat his weak head nae farrach has That helmet for to bear, Nor has he mergh intil his banes, To wield Achilles' spear: Nor his bra targe, on which is seen The yerd, the sin, and lift, Can well agree wi' his cair cleuck, That cleckit was for thift. Fat gars you than, mischievous tyke! For this propine to prig, That your sma banes wou'd langel sair, They are sae unco big? An' gin the Greeks sud be sae blind, As gi' you sik a gift, The Trojan lads right soon wou'd dight You like a futtle haft. An' as you ay by speed o' fit Perform ilk' doughty deed, Fan laggert wi' this bouksome graith, You will tyne half your speed. Besides your targe, in battle keen, Bat little danger tholes, While mine wi' mony a thudd is clour'd, An' thirl'd sair wi' holes. Bat now, fat need's for a' this din? Lat deeds o' words tak' place, An lat your stoutness now be try'd, Just here before your face. Lat the arms of Achilles brave Amon' our faes be laid, An' the first chiel that brings them back, Lat him wi' them be clad. THE END. A Shop BILL. To ilka body be it kend, Frae John A-groats to the land's end, That frae this day I do intend, some shanks to sell; This is my bill, to you I send that it may tell: That gin you chance for me to speer, I'll fit you weel wi' doughty geer That either knabbs or lairds may weer, and ladies tee, For ilka season i' the year, as ye shall see. An' first o' hose I hae a fouth, Some frae the North, some frae the South, An' some o' our ain quintry grouth, baith grae an' russet, Wi' different clocks; bat yet in truth we ca' it gushet. An' mair attour I'll tell you trow, That a' the moggans are bra new, Some worsted are o' different hue, an' some are cotton, That's safter far na' ony woo, that grows on mutton. Bat gin some lads shou'd stand in need, Of shanks that are for simmer weed, I'll fit them wi' the best o' threed, or white or brown, That may well sair the gentlest bleed in a' the town. The mucklest man he may be fitted Wi' hose that's either wove or knitted, An' gin he likes, he's get them litted, or brown or black; We'll gar him say, he's nae outwitted, fan he comes back. The porter, car-man, or servant lad, That ca's the beast wi' fup or gad, May come to me, fare may be had, for their nain wear, The starkest hose that can be made, an' yet nae dear. Far wary-draggle, an' sharger elf, I hae the gear upo' my skelf, Will mak them soon lay down their pelf, fan anes they see, That they wi' ease can fit themselves, an' deal wi' me. Frae ladies to a servant wench, I can well fit them every inch, An' gin they're fley'd that they shou'd pinch, I'll try them on; Perhaps I may their greening stench, 'ere I hae done. Red, blue an' green, an' likewise pearl, I hae to fit the little girl; An' some for those that tak a tirle amo' the sheets, Wi' mony a bony tirly wirl about the queets. The ladies that do tak their pleasure, An' wi' true travel win their treasure, Gin that they hae sae muckle leisure on me to call, I'll fit exactly to their measure, baith great an' small. Besides I'd hae you understand, That I hae caps upo demand, An' gloves likewise, to hap the hand of fremt an' sib. An' napkins, as guid's in a' the land, to dight your nib. Now by my bill you plainly see, That great an' sma can fitted be: Come than flock flaught-bred unto me, an' buy my shanks, You may be sure that I will gi' a warld o' thanks. I likewise tell you by this bill, That I do live upo Tower-hill, Hard by the house o' Robie Mill, just i' the nuik, Ye canna' miss't fan 'ere you will, the sign's a buik. O si nunc juvenes et puellae Wou'd flock in, like micantes stellae, Tum mihi suavius erit melle, fan, frae the thrang, The clink that haps baith back an' belly, I tell ding dang. Sed denique, it is uncommon To send a bill that mentions no man, Ut finem huicce story ponam, sit notum vobis, Simmer an' winter, hoc est nomen, I mean ROB. FORBES.</field>
