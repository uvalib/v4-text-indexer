      <field name="fulltext">Christ's Company. St. Paul. PART OF AN EPISTLE FROM GALLIO, THE DEPUTY OF ACHAIA, TO HIS BROTHER SENECA. Yes; I am grown incapable, 'tis true, To comprehend our fathers what they were; But so are all men now, and so are you. This fallen age can neither see nor hear The heroic strength of thought which laid Itself to work, and conquest made From the wide Infinite displayed To its wide eyes, and in that trade Of region conquest carried men by tribes To people its new colonies: upbraid, Banter not me, my Stoic, for thy gibes Be double-edged; I mean that thought Of Homer or of Plato brought A tract unknown, perhaps unsought, To man's domains; and men upcaught, As in a bark, by such thoughts' mightiness, Were rapt together to the new-found port, And there got apanage, with no dangerous press Of numbers, and no famine, for Such thought was as the harvest store Of diverse grains for usance, or Such that each man could bite its core— Each of a million; yes, that was the age Of Argonauts; but we who now explore, We who are writing up the present page In earth's accounts, can only just Sharpen a thought which may or must Touch one soul only to its lust: No region conquest here, no trust In each of millions that we speak for him; Can more than one find room upon the thrust Point of a pin? We make a splinter trim. Yes, and we subdivide at best The realms of old at large possessed; This truth stings you like all the rest: We are not great, it is confessed. But there's another danger, solemner; The thoughts that work within our children's breast, Shall we miss these? Our children make demur To thy sad creed, e'en while we see The old age rotting utterly, And we in ruin well agree. Yes, there is hope of things to be; Here, while our legionaries from this hill Look lazily along the languid sea, Where the white sails wear windward, waving still With flagging arms to one another: What bring the galleys as they row there,— Ind spice, or Cretan grit; or smother Isle slaves in the monoxylo there? Yields earth no more to earth's monopolizer Than such cheap tribute? Nothing rarer, loather, Than these mean gains? Sad earth! dost thou despise her, Ostian-mouthed Rome, so much as this? Dost thou demand no more? Dost miss No gifts of earth, but tithe anise, Still murmuring, Let be what is? I say, a thought brain-warm and new may grow In any skull to light up the abyss Of any nature, till it overflow (I'll tell you something by and by) On all the nations, and off-wry Our business-like supremacy. For instance, our belief is high; We are the few for whom the many work: Suppose it should be bruited in reply, That nature moves the world in equal cirque; How wildly should we retograde Confounded from the web we've made O'er all the world with spear and spade! Again, our creed is now our trade, That the brute multitude may crouch and pray At popular altars, little reverence paid By us, who supervise the popular way, Aristocrats, philosophers: Suppose an intimation stirs That God holds by His worshippers, The swine are right and wisdom errs: Then, all are right but thou and I and I, And there is hooting where a fool occurs; Brother, behold a possibility! Changes may come; see how the air Stirs curls that leave the forehead bare Of your Domitian, so aware, While you by hint and dint prepare His soul with Stoic maxims for the world, And with Greek dramas and such other fare For growing upwards rightly trimmed and curled. You Stoic poet, is it well To blow the wrong end of the shell, Concluding with a Stoic spell All life as in a citadel, Half active, and half theoretic; so, Just as the father of your porch did tell? At least you rightly keep your creed, to go Retracing with poetic skill The springs Castalian rill by rill! Those stories anciently did thrill The blind man of Olympus hill. Your Hercules I've read, as good almost As if in Trachis written; still, yet still An age whose greatest poet is a post Of that old porch, is a strange age, I am no Stoic, yet a sage, Living in Greece here, where yet rage Some flutterers 'gainst your iron cage: We are Platonists in Greece here, we maintain A various expectation, which bids gauge The world as not set in this state and strain For ever; hold in spite of sin A chastity of mind wherein Some glimpse of that reserve we win, Which Essence holds amidst the din Of outward life and death: since man is base, Is nature base, doth God fail? Not so thin Of faith am I; nay, though I grant this phase, This present, which we all abhor, May be the last save one that o'er The world shall pass, yet I ignore Thy sentence, “There remains no more.” Nay, there's an infinite nothing; we shall come Thither at least, and have not reached that shore; We have at least then so much floating room. Now with your leave let me rehearse In brief what prompts me, the reverse Of your conclusion; why I nurse This hope of better out of worse. Five days ago held I a curule hall: A heap of Jews rushed, mad as if the thyrse Drave them: they haled along a certain Paul As prisoner, whom they did accuse Of those strange questions of the Jews Of which I gave you lately news: Their laws, they said, he did refuse To worship by; among their heretics Numbered him; but what chiefly served to bruise Their Jew galls was that he had dared to mix Them with the Gentiles; he had said That all men have one common Head, One common law, one common bread, Life, death, flesh, spirit, hope, and dread. These wretched Jews are quite as proud as we; Moreover, Paul affirmed one, sometime dead By Roman law, a seer of Galilee, To be alive: I think I wrote Something of this report remote To illustrate this very thought That the dead die not;—time will show 't. This seer then Paul affirmed to be the Christ, Or prophet, for whose advent the Jews doat. All this so angered me, I seized one priest And scourged him, drove the rest away, Dismissed their prisoner—hold here—stay— Their prisoner—what may I say? Describe those features? He did sway An arm and side towards his slanderers, And fixed an eye upon me like the ray Of humid star; a certain reverence errs From further portrait, but he seemed, A fire-calm soul; a something dreamed Between us, as his eyeballs gleamed With inner vision, which outbeamed And sunned him, as I had beheld a man Had gone through all the forms of thought esteemed Amongst us, by the which we think we can Gain the truth's truth; I think that he Had taken from them all the fee, Nor failed to find not one to be The knowledge, but had found the key Some other way, he looked beyond them all, Yet far from sadness, confident and free, As if he held them still, let nothing fall Of all that ever he had learned, But all by inner force had turned To one harmonic; I discerned A pathos which not flamed but burned— A pathos which consisted in the truth, As I should call it, not from passion churned, Not tearful pathos suddenly uncouth, But rising from the very might, With which he held the Infinite; As if some moment past his night Had changed to glory in a blight Which withered all desire except to tell How God did once through all his senses smite. I am too old to think old things: 'tis well; Such men would die, for what they hold; He has seen that which doth enfold His eyesight always, yea, upmould His nature, which nor heat nor cold Can suffer in the welding glow of faith. I questioned Barrhus why he lowered the gold Spiral upon my lituus, which he hath, Until Paul's exit, doing force To Rome's majesty; this of course Insufferable by the laws Divine and human;—whence the source Of such a strange neglect I had observed? Barrhus, my oldest of apparitors, Fixed his grim head towards me, never swerved, Weeping stone tears from Scythian eyes, And clipped me such a mint of lies— Or truths—heart-told in any wise, About Paul's preaching;—novelties I almost thought, until I thought again You say that nothing new can ever rise; He said that Paul was one of many men, Who words and works and wonders show, In name of Him their nation slew, Whom they aver to live anew, Whom they allege to Greek and Jew, In whose name they do bid all men repent, With many other doctrines which ensue From this; even Barrhus spoke as he were sent To sound this one word to me then Straight out from heaven, not as if men Had taught it him, and he again Taught me a secondhand refrain. The sum of all was hope in things to come, And faith that gives hope substance in our pain, And love that perfects faith; yes, love the sum Of sums: the sweetness in the thing Seemed here, that love was named the ring Which linketh man to God, the wing Which strikes the eternal shadowing With one firm shadow; the great category (Rest here, rest here) from which the truth doth sing, Through every other form with brightest glory. Winds weary with the old sea tune Slide inland with some cloud, and soon From woods that whisper summer noon, Weigh their wight wings with odour boon; So I, long salted in our ocean drear Of disbelief that Essence can be won By any form of thought invented here, Felt such a gush of joy about My heart-roots, as if in and out 'Twas life-blood billowed; and as stout As once we sent the battle-shout, Pitching clear notes against barbaric din,— Oh, brother, my soul's voice against the rout Of unbeliefs a man doth nurse within, Arising and protesting wild, Spake, speaking out untruth defiled; Spake, speaking in the truth exiled; Spake, Little head and weary child, Come home, God loves, God loves through sin and shame; Come home, God loves his world: and thy so-styled Instincts, which whispered this even in the name Of doubts and of carnalities, Were true conclusions, nature-wise; In thy old scorned formalities And creeds, God looks thee in thine eyes! Wherefore believe again thine ancient lore, For whatsoever Reason doth devise, Her fiery wings and fire-cloud cars to soar, They truly gain the living height, Because as their most proper freight They carry love, the infinite Of man, up to the rapturous site Of love, the infinite in nature spread. Shall forms in nature always play at sleight With forms in man, that nature's chief and head? Nay, God is an authority, We deem, in nature; let Him be Authority in us, that we Hold this for certainty, that He Yields up Himself to all our grasps of thought— Our little nets cast in the shoreless sea, Our dartles launched in skilled or skilless sort, Our reason in its many modes, Its paths lead to the star abodes, Spherical music lights those roads To love's true ending, which is God's. O Love, thou art the secret of our God; Thou art, O Love, the centre of heaven's codes; The due thou art by all to all things owed! This love within me grew alive So late in this my life, I strive To give it language; do thou give Me audience; we so late arrive Where we have been so many years agone; Yet think of this, with whom should God connive At such a madman as would gather stone For his own grave? Rather be built Houses for dwelling with the silt Of every creed and knowledge, spilt From the deep waters, which do lilt With prescient music unto mortal ears,— Plena sunt omnia Dei; in our guilt, Failure and pain this very love inheres. I wrote all this to thee last night Beneath my lonely chamber light, Impelled through the long hours to write Up to this point, at which the blight Of the stealthy morning withered my pale lamp, And in my vases all the fir-cones lite Drew their brown mouths a little wider, ramp Sweet briars with all their berries red, A palsy took the arbute dead Asleep till now; he shook and said, It is high morning overhead, Where are my birds that sported in my boughs? The nearer cones no answer breathed, afraid To lose an instant of their dear carouse Of the new morning's life divine; Then first I slept amid the shine Of all my loving flowers quirine; And then Paul's face, which did decline All through the broken waters of my sleep, Changed wonderfully in a magic sign, Became in part another's, part did peep A visage at me terrible,— 'Twas my own look, I knew half well, My very self; dead mutterings tell This truth to me; and then the spell Wrought so that through one ghostly countenance Two souls did strive to speak, to think, to quell Each other; then I woke and tell my chance. Paul spake of One: what man is He, We ask; what other could He be Save whom I saw, whom all may see Of us—another and the Me? Thou wouldst inquire concerning Him, of whom Spake Paul—the Christ? My dream I tell to thee, I saw another striving to become Myself in self; this was the Christ I think, be sure I have not missed Paul's meaning, that God's Word uprist Doth grant the truth to all who list. Oh, just, and pious, and pitiful heart of God! There is one Word of Truth who makes acquist Of human words pronounced in our exode, From other unto other faith— Most holy word, as Philo saith (Another Jew) doth knit the rath Unto the late with equal breath. God grant He may have whispered unto me, For some fulfilment this poor soul to graith; God grant He may have walked in Galilee, For there belike my love may dwell; From this full morning breathes the smell Of olden years; from hidden dell A wind breathes over deserts fell With whitened bones. Farewell, farewell. St. John. I Nothing has come to the night except the moon: I see her now; the black and heavy clouds Rustle in foam before her, tossed and strewn, As when at first God's word the clammy crowds, Half mist, half water, and all ghost, upfroze, And bared for man the nether firmament Between the sea and sky, what time the rent II Clouds like a garment parted from it, and close The dark fogs sauntered earthwards; now as soon Yon clouds part upwards, downwards; and outflows Vast amber, and the night in happy boon Is happy now, solemn and clear and cold; And full of happy love, broods love—possessed O'er the dark world, like dove upon her nest. III And I am happy now, so manifold The past is, and the present so serene: Thought I my soul was ready for the gold Of visions? but they come not; therefore e'en As ever, let me think to keep my soul Fixed on the whole circumference, which weds The centre ever to itself, and spreads IV In light like waves for ever; on the whole Of love in love divinely multiplied; Not generated in the onward roll Of ages, though to men 'tis centuried; But rather in all points of time perfected, As in the bosom of the mind divine, So in the thoughts of life which thence outshine; V And thirdly, in the sparkles thence deflected Into the bosom of this world of man; In oracles and laws of grace connected Through the six ages; God alone, who can Know how the stream of time doth measure round Into a breathing circle held within— The eternal circle which doth both begin VI And end it; He alone can know the sound Which that glad circle in its rounding makes In both my ears: for say, was I not found In the blest bosom of that love, which slakes Our human thirst, when all the rest at gaze With distant eyes were murmuring, Is it I? Lord, is it I? And think ye no reply VII Did make me nearer to the hidden ways Of love, no response beat into my ear From that deep heart which pulsed the awful rays To the eyes beneath whose curve I did upsteer My reverend gaze, whilst holding solemn state In the upper room;—no benediction pressed Like a spear's head of bliss into my breast? VIII Yea, truly, as I then beheld elate The very form itself of love indeed; And comprehended in a moment's fate That which all comprehending doth exceed, By science all incomprehensible; Incomprehensible things comprehending, So ever since that saintly ray's first sending IX The bliss renews itself in visions still, And urges me for ever to aspire To that great knowledge which drew out my will To ecstasy, as fire to flame draws fire; And thus last night the triple period Saw I of love; beheld I love in man, In angels, and in God; that love began X In agony, lived in service, but in God Existed in a wise no tongue may tell; That, as flowers issue from the underclod, Man's anguish gives angelic love its shell Of service; whence the angels owe to man Much bliss; of love and anguish God doth mix Peace, which He gives His world in golden pyx. XI I saw last night three boding crows which ran Before my feet; I followed, and they sped Their flight; I followed still each flapping van, That washed like nearer waves above my head, Like nearer waves of the dark sea of night, Almost against my face their raven spray, As down I followed by a narrow way. XII I saw a garden full of flowers so bright, That emeralds set around deep ruby dyes, And seed of pearl in golden agraffes pight, To them were dim; the lion's glowing eyes Reflected on the tiger's head and tongue Were dim: with starry glow their dartles burst The night mists, and with purple grain traversed. XIII I saw where some were red as glutted prong, To which the blood doth cling in ruddy beads, Sanguinely gleaming, with jagged leaves and long, And whispered one another round the meads, Which held in fiery travail all their wrath: I would have asked if they would wake all night, But got no answer, for to my affright XIV Those were not crows: unto an inner path, Which greenly wound within the sanguine belt, A shining serpent lured me; he his bath Chose in the coolest green, whose sweets he smelt, And there beheld the gecko with his spots Move sideways underneath the crumbling frond, Where the white woody fibres blazed the bond XV Hit in the scrannel wind-bit knees and knots; That serpent flew upon the gecko, swift As evil thoughts do fly on evil thoughts: The lizard both its stings at once did lift At head and tail; while, circling it, the lithe Wheel of the serpent surged and spun and quaked, The lizard shuddering like a body naked XVI In hues of fear, which down his corse did writhe, Alternating in motion, till the snake Struck, and the gecko stung, each almost blithe To feel the wounds such threatening could make. Thus they two fought together, till I saw What I do say, that they did bite and clip And poison one another, till the whip XVII Of fury wrought against their nature's law; Immingled each in each they lay deformed, Each of his own dimension; then the maw Of the dragon 'gan to hiss, the snake outwormed Into the dragon's head and double tail; Thus they transchanged their natures, and again The snake pursued, the gecko fled in vain. XVIII Then from the venom, which did foam and fail Into the ground, my trembling eyeballs saw A straight and pulp-leaved shoot spring up, and trail A hurtful form in the thick air, and draw Its rankness to the rotten soil beneath: It grew with bristly spots of hair, whose tops Bore berries green, gathered in pending drops, XIX In act to fall from out their careless sheath, Like caterpillars curled in greenish balls Before they loose from plants their greedy teeth: This plant grew upwards as a serpent crawls, And like a lizard was its lateral bend, And in its substance 'twas a man; its face Dwelt upon wickedness, so crafty base, XX I thought a mandrake would itself extend No other way from its old womb of earth; Then saw I that this belt of green did trend With growths no other than had had their birth From the dull strife of those two venomed things: Very satyrs did they hurtle in the press, And shouldered one another motionless, XXI Tempting me: one I grasped through all its stings, And crushed my hand into its pulpy cells; But soon drew back in horror, for two wings Whirred out and shrieked above me, and the bells Wept in white tears, to which a thousand flies Flew, and would blacken them with swarming specks, Before the night could feel white tears to vex XXII Her wicked heart: these wings whirred circle-wise Above me, and I cannot tell till now What wings they were; I give you this surmise, That they did spring out of the wounded bough, As from Medusa's blood the father sprung Of half the Grecian fiends; then did I flee From that green hideous belt, and sheltered me XXIII In a white brake beyond a space of dung, Which wound within the green belt; there I walked Softly awhile before I felt the lung Of the deep night breathe on the lengthy stalked Flowers, faintly faring in their families: As white were these as those I left were green, And bathed in pearl-white light; and as the scene XXIV Of the broad moon, o'erhanging its own rise, Were to be peopled by the swarming brood Of larvas, lenures, and anatomies, Which should o'ercross her, and remain subdued, Tortured and writhing in the searching beam; So saw I o'er these flowers so smoothly hewn A great light rising whiter than the moon, XXV So did the fogs and mists take heart to gleam Round that white fire, but could not live upon 't; So did the bats and owls leave their night theme And ramp and scream, but could not bear to haunt Upon it, but whirred madly up and down, And all the ground was fell alive with snakes, So that great terror seized me in the brakes, XXVI And I went forward towards that light'ning crown Over the innumerous ghostly flowers of night; Until I reached it, and beheld full blown A mighty flower of flowers dressed in white, In very heart of that translucent flame, Without one leaf it rose up from the ground, And gloriously issued in its white flower round. XXVII Then even as I looked that flower became A glorious lady, standing in meek pride, Upon whose front, “called out of Misraim,” I read, written in blood: “I am the Bride Won by my knight Christ with the sword of wood, The thorns, the nails, the spear.” She spoke, and her Two hands fell round the cross, her ransomer. XXVIII Upon the lotus of her face I stood Long meditating; while I scanned her robes Of whitest samite, striped with stripes like blood, And partly soiled with ashes, sad as Job's, Whom Satan did reprove with many a stroke; And all the seam was wrought with little crosses Of brightest flame, which pierced little bosses XXIX Of hearts that seemed like eyes, and wept and spoke. Her form was beautiful and wondrous tall, Her eyes were like half-moons in cloudy smoke, Her height was as a pillar in a wall, Her hair was as a flowery banner free, Her glory like a fountain in the rocks, Her graciousness like vines to tender flocks, XXX Her eyes like lilies shaken by the bees, Her hair a net of moonbeams in a cloud, Her thinness like a row of youngling trees, And golden bees hummed round her in a crowd, And “pascit inter lilia,” she sung. Her voice was as the sound of water borne From draw-wells deep, and poured among the corn. XXXI Then I, “Ah, loose to me that heavenly tongue, And tell me what it is that I have seen, Ah, spouse, ah, sister of my Lord, upstrung In spirit have I reached the very queen, As many times before in other scene Thou hast enlightened me with heavenly mien, Now mayest thou also to thy servant deign. XXXII “Now tell me what the triple belt doth mean, With the three kinds of flowers, red, green, and white; And wherefore dost thou tarry here, serene, Who mightest worship in the very height Beside the rainbow, most blessed?” She sung, “Behold I feed among the lilies, and they grow Again, without the sense of any woe.” XXXIII With temperate joy her smile rose gently cold, As if the wind should bid a sough-reed work Its circle-ripples in the water-wold; “I am God's love in anguish in the mirk Plains which the king of hell usurped, and hath; And not my lilies do I comfort only, But every flower, bell-formed, long-leaved, or conely. XXXIV “The ruddy flowers are sons of strife and wrath, Right seldom do they see the praise of God; The green flowers flourish but for Satan's swath, God doth not bid them occupy the sod: Yet one time shall I dwell among them, fain To stay their greenness from its venom food, And Christ's true mysteries shall purge their blood. XXXV “The white flowers are my children, by the rain Of blood and water nourished; they are sad And faint, thou seest; but they have life in pain: Hereafter shalt thou view me pure and glad, Yea, throned and gloried in the Seraphin, My ministers, who guard me in their guise; Christ's body hath chief glory in the skies.” XXXVI Those golden bees, which all this time within Reach of her balmy breath clung murmuringly, Like dance of gnats, which in the morning spin Their maze beneath some widely spreading tree, In spite of all the spider's cruel eyes, And dare not venture forth their wanderings Lest the new air should damp their gauzy wings. XXXVII These golden bees in such a wondrous wise Did now increase their lustre, and about That dame did flash such splendid ministries, And spun with such swift motion, that their rout Dazzled her from my eyesight clean away; Nor aught could I discern a little space, But groped in darkness, with a stumbling pace XXXVIII Leaving that spot and tottering on my way, Until I felt my garment drag behind Over rough stones; and there knelt I to pray, And there the freshness of a river wind Rise to my face, and on my hands and knees I leaned, and felt cold water creep along, Up to my wrists, the while a mighty gong XXXIX Burst awfully from out the very breeze: At length I could look up, and to a sea Of fire wavetops; not wavetops of these seas Ægean, white wavetops or black; the lee Shore where I stood received a fiery train Of phosphor billows, which did seethe so free, They made that river boundless as the sea. XL Then leaped I in, impelled by secret pain; This was the way in which I won the heaven; The many billows heard my breath complain, Then bore me downwards with a mighty steven: Like a pale man just dead, in peace my corse Rolled downwards like a log o'ercharged with weeds To where the widening river bed recedes XLI Into the ocean; there the tidal force Cast me upon this island lone and drear, When as I oped mine eyes I saw the course Of heaven begin: a mountain rose i' the air Cut with strict stairs of jasper, and along Its windings downwards coming did I see A heavenly throng in glorious panoply. XLII Yea, that great glory sweeping in a throng Of aureoles before me; saints were there Bowed till their wings o'ercrossed them; while a song Streamed from their lips apart, which never were Stirred from that curve of rapture tremulous; And they rose heads o'er heads, on high, on high, Gold, golden glory, to the verge of sky; XLIII From which they issued multitudinous; Wherein appeared a glow of ruby bright, And clear sweet sapphire; 'twas the very house Of veiling; whence on all the raiment white, On golden glories and on golden hair Spread thickly like a golden fleece about On virgin shoulders, and so threaded out XLIV On lilies with their gold crowns crumbled fair, And solemn leaves curled with some thought severe, Or heads bowed forward with the weight of prayer, On heads uplifted backwards to revere, Streamed forth a mighty blessing from above, Streamed forth a splendour from the ruby red, And a great pureness from the sapphire dread. XLV Ranged row on row they come; the light of love Burned softly in their eyes, row ranged on row Of men in heavenly panoply, a grove Of violet plumes and lifted swords; below And through, 'twixt arm and shoulder, and between Plumed helm and helm, wild eyes and golden hair And passionate lips; with throngings here and there, XLVI The goodly people of that heavenly queen, Blessedest, sweetest, holiest, fairest, all; Unto me and below me as I ween, Whilst I beyond them upwards to the wall Of heaven did gaze, where as if unawares A mystery passed in the light of light Along the whole length of the heaven's height. XLVII The wall rose solemnly in many squares, Of scarlet brick, above a moated space Of water clear; and by unending stairs This company was crossing to my place, Their splendours ever reaching lower and lower, I gazing higher and higher, for my chin An angel lifted, and 'twas from within XLVIII His golden wings that veiled his sight that hour, That I too looked and saw a mystery Proceed, while mightily shone out the flower Of the gold wings upon the violet sky, Came in their battles, all the seraphim With giant plumes, with glory-beaming eyes, Long bands and wrapping robes, in solemn guise, XLIX Came Michael, and an army followed him; His sword, two-handed, carried he before, His vast eyes on the hilt, his shield's broad rim Swung half of it behind him; in the score Of his knights followed all the cherubim; And half the stars shone in his banner wide And in it all the winds were multiplied. L Came Gabriel, with his banner over him, White lilies, brass-bright flowers, and leaves of green; A lily, too, he carried seemed to brim, With golden flames, which mounted pure and clean To touch his blessed mouth, and then would trim Themselves within the lily leaf again: Gabriel's fair head sank even with dream-pain LI Came Raphael, and an army followed him; His staff was in his hand, as he strode on; His gourd was slung behind; one mighty limb Showed itself bare in passing; and upon His track came many a knightly palmer grim: On horses these, their horses well beseen As those who fight on earth for heaven's queen. LII Came Uriel, and his banner over him— Red-pointed flames that lightened on the field Of steadfast judgment, sapphirine, till dim The eyesight, and the brain behind it reeled; Behind him walked the strong robed seraphim; A roll and book in his two hands he bore, At which great trembling all my entrails tore. LIII Came Chamuel, and his banner over him, Half red, half blue, and barred with golden bars; Upon a seat of cloud he seemed to swim, Red, yellow, grey, and passed across the stars; Across his knees, in both his hands, a slim, Long quivering rod, with sword leaves at the end; Chamuel went swiftly, seeming to ascend. LIV Came Jophiel, and an army followed him: In his right hand a sword gleamed sharp and clear, Whose edge he felt with his left hand, and grim Smiled he to find it biting very sheer; His thousands thronged behind of seraphim, Armed likewise all; his fiery footsteps cleft The little white clouds on the pathway weft. LV Come Zadkiel, and an army followed him; Closed were their hands, and wings half shut to sail; Grey and much crimson seemed their vesture, dim, Much like a dream, as when the light doth fail In melancholy wrack and crimson bar Above a storm; his army flitted on Like falling leaves; some sadness, all were gone. LVI These all went solemnly, as if to war; The seven archangels, with his army each; They drifted in their march away, till far In the blind sky together in one reach, Like a great flight of birds: I watching, saw Their great pavilions set far off like palls, Beyond the utmost circle of heaven's walls. LVII High to the west three cloudlike palls I saw; The highest, foamy flakes of gray and rose; The next long strips of blue with saffron flaw; The last of gray, and over it clear glows Of yellow vapour: 'neath them all a vast Blue lake, and under it a long grey shore, And so another lake, paler; then more LVIII Of long gray shore, with pale fire-fringe, that passed Beneath it, folding in another lake Of water blue; and to grim hills at last, Whose upper parts were white with many a flake Of shining lava; and their slopes were gray, And ended in the earth with one great wild Border of lurid suphur triply piled. LIX Thither did all God's angels pass away, And then a voice cried, Woe, Jerusalem: And by this time I saw myself; I say, Could see myself the way that I saw them, Drawn by my two arms upwards, lifted straight Upward, and laid upon a thick red cloud, Like blood soaked into snow, and overbowed LX By horrid frost, and bruised by heavy weight: How weak was I with visions, O Lord God, Not having eaten for so long! my fate Alone of men to quake beneath the rod Of coming woes; yea still to gaze and hear The four beasts answer even where I lay, And great cloud angels rend themselves away LXI From the four corners of my cloudy bier: Above which rose the great white throne, and shook And muttered like a cauldron: deadly near It was; and straight the senses all forsook This trunk; like as when foam spreads heavily On tides, some spume clings in a small shore-bay Some little time, so clung I where I lay. LXII I and my cloud: the rest was mystery. Oh, humble heart, forbear to speak at all; Yet verily the love-beam beamed on me. Then like a rainbow did that lady call,— “For ever shalt thou teach God's love to man In wondrous fulness both of joy and pain, Apostle of the Lamb that once was slain, LXIII “And prophet thou !—apostle, thou dost scan The round of love in triple period, Prophet—not any prophet is so wan— Tell out the vials of the wrath of God.” I gather that beyond these coasts Ægean Beyond this little world of Greeks, where nought But man exists, nor knowledge save of thought, LXIV The throne of love waves in the empyrean, In angel clouds, flame hues, sharp crystal wracks; In mountain spears uplifted as a pæan, In mighty rivers sent through golden tracks, In lands unknown, where, yet a little while And men shall pray: lo, now, a sorrow-smile, The purple cloud swells over isle and isle. St. Peter. Thou brightness of the everlasting light, Unspotted mirror of the power divine, Wisdom and Word, thou Son of God, My heart is broken like a clod, My tears are falling on the sod, Whereas through this long period, Says sorrow, They all forsook Thee, and alike we fled; Ah, how am I so much behind them all? Thy Master, ah, thy thrice denied, Even now they shall have crucified; Wherefore this sobbing may divide The weight thou feelest in heart and side, Says sorrow. John saith that they who love do fear the most; In truth, that very love makes faint and weak; The truest sometimes fail the most; He left Thee in that traitor host, When torches frayed the olive coast, The olives witnessing, “Thou know'st,” In darkness. Saith Philip, that the mortal body weighs The spirit with much trouble to the earth; The senses flatter and perplex, And lust the understanding wrecks, This œnomel the false flower decks, Whose sweets rise up through waxen necks In darkness. Lazarus says he saw a hand stretch forth From end to end of heaven instantly; And holy beams were working out Great scrolls that lightened all about, The mighty sky, which seemed, in doubt, To darken inwards, but without To glory. And on these beams a glory suddenly Rose in the heaven of heavens immeasured height, Which brightened them as if upon Some plain of dædal flowers, which spun Darkly within the wind, the sun Had paled, and then at once begun To glory. This comforts me the most, O Master great, Oh, worker ever, as it may be seen, In anguish, as Thou dost fulfil Composedly the mighty will, Which pierceth as a mighty drill The fashions of the ages, till Through ages The one design connects: ah, still the sod Bids me drain out my tears and wash it through; O Lord, it bids mine eyes renew Their sorrow, for thine eyes so true, As the sad rain might mesh the hue Of flowers tenderer than grew Through ages. Sadly the grassy sod sobs to the leaves; Come down to me, and I will bury you; In my deep bosom ye shall lie; Too long ye wave and flag on high; The dews drop softly from the sky Like syllables, “weep, weep, and die;” The leaves fall. The little trefoils twinkle their sweet eyes; The little banks of grass together thrust With shrivelled points, will never tear you, On their small poignards they shall bear you, Frittered like flame their points shall spare you, The binding weed shall gently snare you (The leaves fall) Down to my fresh moss heart, where ye shall watch Your scarlet purple mother branches gleam; While worm and emmet work anon, To trace in each its skeleton, And all heaven's curdling clouds roll on O'er fruits which, lurid, sanguine, dun, (The leaves fall,) Droop lower and lower towards me: ah, come down, Ye stay and flutter all too long! the fig Swoops in large circles, and where frets The anxious vine, she sadly sets The ashy spider with his nets To do her watching while she lets The leaves fall. The hoary nightshade drops her berries here, The tragacanth with purple eyelids weeps, The ivy-thorn his leaves depends To where the comfort woodbine wends To rescue from the briar her friends; 'Tis sadly thinking for what ends 'Twas borrowed. For my Lord's brow—my tears fall last of all; My bitter weeping closes up the night; I cannot hear, I weep so sore The thorn lamenting evermore To thin leaves stirring on the floor Of moss that trembles to the core, 'Twas borrowed. Yet have I secret comforts in my soul, I think my soul finds comfort in strange ways, Where others would but die, or sink Depth after depth from the first brink Of sinning; this, as I must think, Doth distance me at least a link From others, From traitorous mouths which do but hide the truth, As clouds that hold no water hide the heavens, And slip from guilt to guilt like beasts In tracks, as Pharisees and priests, Who strive the greatest's, not the least's, Sedile to occupy at feasts From others. Then jostle one another and devour; So these composed souls, being set one way, If they transgress, pursue the wrong Sleekly from guile to guile along A path well downwards, in a throng— So common 'tis—like swine the prong Drives onward Without reprieve; they do but overbear The one course which their nature gave at first, While I, though in me was made breach, Because I hate them, rally reach; I fell before their hoot and screech, Because I hate the ways that each Drives onward. Oh, coward, coward, coward! But this I know, That love in God is goodness, and in Christ That love is mercy, and in man That love is sorrow; I shall plan, Unplan, and grasp, and gasp, and scan, From this my life out; who shall ban My sorrow? Not earth that drinks my tears; not heavenly sky, Not they who took with me the bread and wine; Perhaps not God who looks on me, The Father, thinking of the tree Of cursing in me rooted, see The flinders; not the victim, He, My sorrow! St. Mary Magdalene. Kneeling before the altar step, Her white face stretched above her hands; In one great line her body thin Rose robed right upwards to her chin; Her hair rebelled in golden bands, And filled her hands; Which likewise held a casket rare Of alabaster at that tide; Simeon was there and looked at her, Trancedly kneeling, sick and fair; Three parts the light her features tried, She rest implied. Strong singing reached her from within, Discordant, but with weighty rhymes; Her swaying body kept the stave; Then all the woods about her wave, She heard, and saw, in mystic mimes, Herself three times. Once, in the doorway of a house, With yellow lintels painted fair, Very far off, where no men pass, Green and red banners hung in mass Above scorched woodwork wormed and bare, And spider's snare. She, scarlet in her form and gold, Fallen down upon her hands and knees, Her arms and bosom bare and white, Her long hair streaming wild with light, Felt all the waving of the trees, And hum of bees. A rout of mirth within the house, Upon the ear of madness fell, Stunned with its dread, yet made intense; A moment, and might issue thence Upon the prey they quested well, Seven fiends of hell. She grovelled on her hands and knees, She bit her breath against that rout; Seven devils inhabited within, Each acting upon each his sin, Limb locked in limb, snout turning snout, And these would out. Twice, and the woods lay far behind, Gold corn spread broad from slope to slope; The copses rounded in faint light, Far from her pathway gleaming white, Which gleamed and wound in narrow scope, Her narrow hope. She on the valley stood and hung, Then downward swept with steady haste; The steady wind behind her sent Her robe before her as she went; Descending on the wind, she chased The form she traced. She, with her blue eyes blind with flight, Rising and falling in their cells, Hands held as though she played a harp, Teeth glistening as in laughter sharp, Flew ghostly on, a strength like hell's, When it rebels. Behind her, flaming on and on, Rushing and streaming as she flew; Moved over hill as if through vale, Through vale as if o'er hill, no fail; Her bosom trembled as she drew Her long breath through. Thrice, with an archway overhead, Beneath, what might have seemed a tomb; White garments fallen fold on fold, As if limbs yet were in their hold, Drew the light further in the gloom, Of the dark room. She, fallen without thought or care, Heard, as it were, a ceaseless flow Of converse muttered in her ear, Like waters sobbing wide and near, About things happened long ago Of utter woe. The Holy Mother at the Cross. Of Mary's pains may now learn whoso will, When she stood underneath the groaning tree Round which the true Vine clung: three hours the mill Of hours rolled round; she saw in visions three The shadows walking underneath the sun, And these seemed all so very faint to be, That she could scarcely tell how each begun, And went its way, minuting each degree That it existed on the dial stone: For drop by drop of wine unfalteringly, Not stroke by stroke in blood, the three hours gone She seemed to see. Three hours she stood beneath the cross; it seemed To be a wondrous dial stone, for while Upon the two long arms the sunbeams teemed, So was the head-piece like a centre stile; Like to the dial where the judges sat Upon the grades, and the king crowned the pile, In Zion town, that most miraculous plat On which the shadow backward did defile; And now towards the third hour the sun enorme Dressed up all shadow to a bickering smile I' the heat, and in its midst the form of form Lay like an isle. Because that time so heavily beat and slow That fancy in each beat was come and gone; Because that light went singing to and fro, A blissful song in every beam that shone; Because that on the flesh a little tongue Instantly played, and spake in lurid tone; Because that saintly shapes with harp and gong Told the three hours, whose telling made them one; Half hid, involved in alternating beams, Half mute, they held the plectrum to the zone, Therefore, as God her senses shield, it seems A dial stone. Three hours she stood beside the cross; it seemed A splendid flower; for red dews on the edge Stood dropping; petals doubly four she deemed Shot out like steel knives from the central wedge, Which quadranted their perfect circle so As if four anthers should a vast flower hedge Into four parts, and in its bosom, lo, The form lay, as the seed-heart holding pledge Of future flowers; yea, in the midst was borne The head low drooped upon the swollen ledge Of the torn breast; there was the ring of thorn; This flower was fledge. Because her woe stood all about her now, No longer like a stream as ran the hour; Because her cleft heart parted into two, No more a mill-wheel spinning to time's power; Because all motion seemed to be suspense; Because one ray did other rays devour; Because the sum of things rose o'er her sense, She standing 'neath its domè as in a bower; Because from one thing all things seemed to spume, As from one mouth the fountain's hollow shower; Therefore it seemed His and her own heart's bloom, A splendid flower. Now it was finished; shrivelled were the leaves Of that pain-flower, and wasted all its bloom, She felt what she had felt then; as receives, When heaven is capable, the cloudy stroom The edge of the white garment of the moon; So felt she that she had received that doom; And as an outer circle spins in tune, Born of the inner on the sky's wide room, Thinner and wider, that doom's memories, Broken and thin and wild, began to come As soon as this: St. John unwrapt his eyes, And led her home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Poems. A Lenten Mystery. FIDES IN DEO OPTIMA. In the dread Patmos of the town I heard a voice from heaven come down; Then found me in a desert place Of kneaded clay-field, poor and base, With a crowd flowing at its edge. Then did the voice great things allege Against the town in bitter rhyme. The Voice. God his eternity on time, God his infinity on space, Casts: God proceeds in all earth's ways, In all that He hath made God lurks, He waiteth man in all his works: Dost thou in anywise observe His presence as the living nerve Of life, and dost thou reverence For His sake every form of sense, And strive to take each for thine own? Jonah. We answer not, we know not; one With twisted eyes of blue I saw Look this way for a moment; awe Lowered for a moment half his lids, But he knows not; that other bids Thee mock thyself with what he is, Being a fiend with infamies Unnumbered eating up his soul; But all know nothing, in the whole Mass of them is not one that knows. The Voice. How mightily heaven overflows, How countlessly doth God indite Himself in darkness and in light, And all that grows between these two— Star-formed, and written on the blue Void of the all-embracing shade— Shade-formed, and solemnly inlaid Between bright forms of life that crawl In and out the mother womb of all The solemn all-embracing shade. Jonah. We know not, Lord, what Thou hast said, Ah, what, O Lord, can these men know? The Voice. God seemed as man long time ago, His going was in Eden heard Among the trees, his presence scared Blood-shedding Cain; again, again God felt as man, felt human pain, And pity, wrath, and jealousy; God spake as man, this finally: The Word made flesh among us dwelt, Great glory from the heavens did melt Into the blood of human kings. Jonah. Ah, now we wake, yet the lie clings Sordidly, makes the truth a lie. The Voice. Which three things live continually, God seemed as man, yea felt, yea lived; Still, still God walketh undeceived About the Eden of his earth, And still holds solemn wrath or mirth At things which happen in this time; And still He liveth in man's clime, And speaketh words which do remain; Christ-God hath come to make them plain, Christ-God, to seal this sacrament. Jonah. Alive now? What is their intent? Crossing their thumbs with writhing lips, And eyes set grimly. One upwhips His arm-long club, and fell and full Closes upon the shaggy skull Of his own ass, already cut To the white bone. The Voice. This doth outshut All infinites, that Christ left His, Yet brings it to His sacrifice, (O mystery of mysteries, Leaving His infinities, And entering into space and time, The Godhead!) this transcends sublime, That through man's nature He transfuse What soul and corpse alike renews, The perfect God and perfect Man! Jonah. Now this enrages, who can scan Such rage, and us not hate therefore? The Voice. All-loving life, He doth restore Through man's own spirit-spring of faith, What man himself hath lost in death, The life eternal, incorrupt, Which He, all-living love, once scooped From His own being, which remains Sunk, but not lost, amid the pains Of death long dying, which revives Under His cordials, breaks its gyves, Adds to itself all forms of life. Jonah. Ah, foully we express our strife, Ah, sicklily we grow malign. The Voice. And stands at last, complex and fine, A perfect man, recovered all, And strong, yea, strong enough to fall Full-breasted on the Infinite. Know ye these issues, feel their light, Breaking from far for those who sit In darkness; how that Christ doth knit In love to love the life once lost? Rage, chafe ye then, because this most Solemn of things in light is lit? Jonah. Behold a mountain, chasm-split, Pine-darkened, ashen with white snows; In every gash a snow-stream flows, A snow-veil slowly breaks and weeps, A snow-rock ghostly wakes and sleeps; Bears limp along its pathless snow, Along its deserts white wolves go, Like flights of ravens in the air; I see four men come forth and glare From grisly caverns where they lie: These gave Christ-God his agony— Pontius Pilatus, and Judas, Herodes, Caiaphas. Judas Iscariotes, Caiaphas, Pontius Pilatus, Herodes. Judas. Take thou this money, Caiaphas, I pray thee now for shame, whereas Thou hast betrayed me; I, alas, My Master dear betrayed. Caiaphas. Much gold to many paid I when I was made priest, to many men; To thee for Christ but pieces ten Of silver thrice I paid. Pontius Pilatus. One came and begged his body here To lay it in a sepulchre; I granted freely his desire, And they have buried him. Herodes. It is great marvel he is dead; Three years ago he came and said That he went up to lay his head Within Jerusalem. Eunice. When her holy life was ended Eunice lay upon her side; When her holy death was ended Eunice died. Then a spirit raised her spirit From the urn of dripping tears; And a spirit from her spirit Soothed the fears. And upon her spirit lightly— Spirit upon spirit-wrote; And she rose to worlds eternal, Taking note. First she joined the world eternal Which is never seen of men; Through its climes she wandered lightly, Happy then. Then she learned a song of comfort For the loves she left behind, Children kissing one another, Husband kind. I have joined the world of spirit, Which the flesh does never see; But to you a realm is open As to me. World invisible of spirit Doth invisible remain Not less certainly to angels Than to men. As you see it not on earth I behold it not in heaven; Yet to both of us alike It is given. For we both may walk within it, And meet blindfolded above; 'Tis the world of thought and feeling And of love. Enter then this world of spirit; It is yours by right of birth, Mine by death: let heaven possess it, And let earth. Dream. I. With camel's hair I clothed my skin, I fed my mouth with honey wild; And set me scarlet wool to spin, And all my breast with hyssop filled; Upon my brow and cheeks and chin A bird's blood spilled. I took a broken reed to hold, I took a sponge of gall to press; I took weak water-weeds to fold About my sacrificial dress. I took the grasses of the field, The flax was bolled upon my crine; And ivy thorn and wild grapes healed To make good wine. I took my scrip of manna sweet, My cruse of water did I bless; I took the white dove by the feet, And flew into the wilderness. II. The tiger came and played; Uprose the lion in his mane; The jackal's tawny nose And sanguine dripping tongue Out of the desert rose And plunged its sands among; The bear came striding o'er the desert plain. Uprose the horn and eyes And quivering flank of the great unicorn, And galloped round and round; Uprose the gleaming claw Of the leviathan, and wound In steadfast march did draw Its course away beyond the desert's bourn. I stood within a maze Woven round about me by a magic art, And ordered circle-wise: The bear more near did tread, And with two fiery eyes, And with a wolfish head, Did close the circle round in every part. III. With scarlet corded horn, With frail wrecked knees and stumbling pace, The scapegoat came: His eyes took flesh and spirit dread in flame At once, and he died looking towards my face. The Wizard's Funeral. For me, for me, two horses wait, Two horses stand before my gate: Their vast black plumes on high are cast, Their black manes swing in the midnight blast, Red sparkles from their eyes fly fast. But can they drag the hearse behind, Whose black plumes mystify the wind? What a thing for this heap of bones and hair! Despair, despair! Yet think of half the world's winged shapes Which have come to thee wondering: At thee the terrible idiot gapes, At thee the running devil japes, And angels stoop to thee and sing From the soft midnight that enwraps Their limbs, so gently, sadly fair;— Thou seest the stars shine through their hair. The blast again, ho, ho, the blast! I go to a mansion that shall outlast; And the stoled priest who steps before Shall turn and welcome me at the door. Reflection. There are two natures make one soul: The sea with many floods, The earth with countless woods: Bring the waves of the sea, Sings the earth, unto me; Bring the waves of the tree Unto me, says the sea. There are two halves that make the whole: The heaven with clouds that drops, The earth with mountain tops, Crying, Give me of the cloud My nakedness to shroud, While the heaven replies as loud, Let me rest each cloud—each cloud. And what art thou, O Death? For thou seemest to gather breath From the crystal spasm Of the mountain, Leaving bare a chasm White and lonely as a fountain. Sea from land—what remain? Desert cavern, arid plain, And the tears that pour From the tottering shore. Heaven from earth— What result has birth? Earth is made hell, Is heaven made earth? Thou art sprung from the writhing Of the lonely low or high thing; And, O Death, thou art cursed To be last, or to be first. The Soul's World. Art thou standing on the shore Which the spirits tremble o'er, Ere they take the plunge for ever In the bottomless receiver: This commencing dissidence Ere it cleave us hence and hence; Ere the first hour stays its sands Since the life-pulse left thy hands; Art thou there, and dost thou cast Thy strange glance, the first and last, On the world which thou didst fill With thy essence: on my will— 'Twas an ocean, and its tide Ruled by thee: therein did ride Fruitful reason—'twas an isle Rendered happy by thy smile; On each process of my brain 'Twas the travailing in pain Of creations which uprose, Founded each on other's close; On my hopes, my joys, my pains;— These were mountains, valleys, plains; On my intellect which fed;— 'Twas a river's sinuous head Eating out into the sea: On my spirit's entity; Which embraced as its own essence Thy whole mystery of presence;— 'Twas the full and rounded sphere In its ether bright and clear. Many a chasm in this thy world Mayest thou view in crystal furled, Many a rent and gristly knot, Many a melting lava grot, Many a white and ghastly waste In thy smiling garden placed, Many an earthquake catching breath From the savage fires beneath. Many a seam of pain and crime, Much of wreck and much of time. Ah, sweet soul of all, then turn From the dark things thou must descern; Quit me not in hate for ever, Plunge not in the deathless river Of the bottomless receiver. The Wanderer. I. Oh, that remote and lonely shore, Between the river and the sea, Towards which my boat was drifting me. Never again, oh, nevermore Let me behold it: 'tis the grave Of a cast nature; yet I have Dream times to think of it, and feel How sweet beneath its cirque of trees The islet lay! The sunbeams stole Downwards, and strove to uncongeal The voiceless magic which did weave The lonely island to my soul. The sunset crowned its cirque of trees, Upon its limbs did shadow cleave, And round its sloping terraces The mists curled like a lawny frieze. II. My shallop parted the tall rushes, The boat's head rustled through the flags; I was alone, All, all were gone; Dead ere its prime, The morning time; Strange bearded men Were out of ken; I had rowed with them Up the river amain; I had fled from them Down the river again. I grasped the overhanging bushes, And drew myself upon the crags. III. I came beside a still lagoon Of inky blackness, whereupon, Like a lake-lily, lay the moon, White, ere her reign of gold begun. IV. I came through vales of level flowers, Sunstruck with glory o'er the grass, Clipped by the winds and the mists in a mass, And silkily, sulkily, hued for the showers. V. I looked upon the wildness blooming, At thronging stems to distance looming, Dim-outlined shadows nearer coming, Dark foliage, more darkly glooming. VI. Then said I, “Every day will bring From the wide rolling of the waves, From the warm breathing of the winds, Some fresh delight, some newer thing, And nature will increase in kinds, And I will be her king. Yes; field, and rock, and flower, and tree, Shall with my presence peopled be, As with a deeper entity. VII. I had been passion-seared, and tost On the blind waves of accident; Had played with chance and always lost, Had loved, and been heart-shent; Had tasted pleasure's after-pain, Had looked for sweet, and found but gall, Had wrestled with my fellow-men, And risen baffled from the fall: I said, I here will have abode, Where never foot of man hath trod. VIII. And I will love all beauty here, But beauty shall be everywhere; And over all my love shall change, Shall flit and hover ceaselessly, And broaden with its wider range, Always intense, but wildly free; But never will I seek return For equal love so widely spent, Oh, never, never let me burn With special passion in me pent! IX. I had fled away, ere my heart should change, From the men who hated me more and more; They toiled afloat In their labouring boat, In their solemn copes, With their arms like ropes: They sat in their ranks On the rowing planks, And they rose and fell To the time of the oar; Black eyes and curt hair; Black eyes watched me well On wave and on shore, Everywhere! I had fled away that my heart might range, From the unendurable sorrow it bore. Now very stilly Lay the lake lily, And not so chilly The covert hilly; The meadow rilly Was not so chilly. I had fled away with the presage strange, Of rest to be won on a secret shore. X. Through forests wide I wandered, Where large-leaved flowers had grown to head, Where fluctuated endless shade. XI. And everywhere my human sense, Fraught with its dread intelligence, Worked with the power reflected thence. XII. I said, “These rocks, and trees, and flowers Have grown and changed, but still remained Mere daughters of the suns and showers, Most beautiful, but ne'er have gained The presence of a human soul, They know not pity, they know not dole, They know not passion's mystery. Lo! I am here a human soul, And I will clothe them in human stole, Will give to each most subtle reach Of sorrow and of sympathy.” XIII. So day by day I wrought my will Upon wide nature's open face; My thought informed each particle Of being throughout all the place; For day by day, when the great sun Was greatest, would I keep the shade Of rocky hollows in the dun And sleepy light by lichen made, And there my thoughts would truant run, While wreaths of fancy round me played. XIV. But when the dews had fallen soft, And night had fallen on the dews; And when the moon was far aloft, Then forth I wandered, not to lose The thoughtfulness of brooding rest, For still emotive power would ooze From the full feelings of my breast; But forth I went through dell and croft, Through all the gloom from east to west. XV. Oft by the marsh's quaggy edge I heard the wind-swept rushes fall; Where through an overgrowth of sedge Rolled the slow mere funereal: I heard the music of the leaves Unto the night wind's fingering, I saw the dropping forest eaves Make in the mere their water-ring. XVI. And so I fared, until, upstaying My thoughts on richer blooms, that gained My eyes, and thence no further straying, Whole solemn hours have I remained, Wreaths of fine fancies round me playing, With advents strange and vanishings; Half in my inmost soul delaying, Half bodied upon outer things. XVII. But day by day about the marge Of this slow-brooding dreaminess, The shadow of the past lay large, And brooded low and lustreless; Then vanished as I looked on it, Yet back returned with wider sweep, And broad upon my soul would sit, Like a storm-cloud above the deep. XVIII. Yea, subtle, word-banned memories, Heart-surges of black bitterness, Untouched by sorrow's softer dyes, About my brain would throng and press: I found I could not alchemize And purge away the dross of facts, And I was mad for human cries, For human sorrows, human acts. XIX. “I see,” I cried, “the waste of waves, That shifts from out the western tracts; I see the sun that ever laves With liquid gold their cataracts; And night by night I see the moon Career and thwart the waves of cloud; I see great nature burgeon Through all her seasons, laughter-browed. But what are these things unto me? They lack not me, they are full-planned. I must have love in my degree, A human heart, a human hand; For oh ! 'tis better far to share, Though life all dark, all bitter be, With human bosoms human care:” I launched my boat upon the sea. The Pilgrim of Love. What I had seen a far-away white cloud So long, had grown a mountain by the morn; A thousand torrents at its feet were loud, And rolled one volume o'er its lowest horn, Which gloried like one whitened wave of sea; And far above the mountain crags were pitched, Like a white mocking hand which beckoned me In gesture, answered by the boat's prow twitched Back o'er the lake, leaving me standing there Alone upon the taunting mountain shore: Now for my life, methought; and first my care Was given to tread the shattered valley o'er, With its rude waste of stones like lions couched Upon the desert; then I reached, indeed, The mountain, where its mighty spur debouched, A vast earth dragon, whose coils half recede Into the bowels of its awful mother; And on its bulk my little pathway wound; Point after point of grisly light did smother The horror which they could not fully sound. And I ascended till I met the wrath Of white snow, dabbled on the gnashing teeth Of slate rocks in the avalanche's path; Then stayed, and looked above, and looked beneath. Above—stand up the crystal spears of rock, Heaven's army, ever charging into light, Retreating into cloud; not less than flock Of dreadful angels from the Sapphirine height; And not in that frank mystery, pretence Of wing or palm, or radiant hands or feet: I see the clear-aired crystal, and the sense Of spiritual presence grows complete. Below—two figures in the morning mist Move up for ever to the mountain's shoulder, On which my rest is settled; then they list, To fade for ever over spur and boulder. I cannot track the light within their eyes, I cannot track the marching of their feet; I only know, whenever they arise, The sense of human presence grows complete. Dawning. Over the hill I have watched the dawning, I have watched the dawn of morning light, Because I cannot well sleep by night, Every day I have watched the dawning. And to-day very early my window shook With the cold wind fresh from the ghastly brook, And I left my bed to watch the dawning. Very cold was the light, very pale, very still, And the wind blew great clouds over the hill Towards the wet place of the dying dawning; It blew them over towards the east In heavier charge as the light increased, From the very death of the dying dawning. Whence did the clouds come over the hill? I cannot tell, for no clouds did fill The clear space opposite the dawning Right over the hill, long, low, and pearl-grey, Set in the wind to live as it may; And as the light increased from the dawning, The cold, cold brook unto my seeming Did intermit its ghastly gleaming And ran forth brighter in the dawning. The wall-fruit stretched along the wall, The pear-tree waved its banners tall; Then close beside me in the dawning, I saw thy face so stonily grey, And the close lips no word did say, The eyes confessed not in the dawning. I saw a man ride through the light Upon the hill-top, out of sight Of me and thee and all the dawning. The Sole Survivor. Blood, blood, blood in the morning sky, Dropping from the clouds on high Down into the sea beneath. Death, death is in the slaty storm, Whose latest volume vanisheth; In the heart of its wild form It rolls the fragment of my wreck: The moon above it waits to die, Waning to a ghostly speck In the bloody morning sky, Ghost of those who fled in death And whose grave is underneath. I am very lone. The cold blue billows race along These abject sands in ceaseless throng; If the sun should rise to-day They will be purple and scarlet grey: I only feel alone. If I did leap into the sea, They would do the same to me. Proserpine. The dragon earth with labyrinthine toils, Terrace on terrace wound her stony coils, And traversed towards a hollow deeply sunk, With writhing stone-beds bordered: there had shrunk Wide mouths that did volcanic flames embower To blossom, as young spring's first yellow flower Cleaves out its pathway through the blackened ridge; From this the white roads sped away to bridge The bare lean-hearted hills; and in their midst Lo Demeter! Sad goddess, wherefore didst With thy small company of savage men, Autochthonic, that night invade the den Of dragon darkness and of nether light? For, lo! the circling mists, grown infinite, Do round themselves to many a torch and lamp; And with wild gleams of limbs, with rolling tramp, With shoutings, pours thy pomp: it nears the spot Where the deep earth-fires sleep awakened not. High in her chariot rode the goddess, crowned With golden harvest fruits that spread around Her shoulder, and her silver sickle's gleam Arched lucidly her forehead, that supreme She rode; and now the wild diviner takes The lustral lavers and the salted cakes; And in the hollow, folded coil on coil, Showing earth's roots encumbered with white spoil,— Hollow enormous, holding murky light, Giving for ever one side severed quite From other by the fierce sheer intervals Of duskiness, o'er which in sullen sprawls The red flame casts itself to colour slime, He sang— Oh, prisoned where the earth doth climb To upper air, in cavern halls, Where flame-like wing and writhing limb Whirl round thy throne, where thousand falls Of Stygian waters eye thee cold, Where the dull font of days outdoled To mortal men drains dry and old, Lethe's unaided brim. Oh, throned beside the dragon black, Who dies at his own mystery, Being a god; oh, folded back Where ghosts and larves do shriek and fly, Where the four rivers of thy throne, Phlegethon, Lethe, Styx, Acheron, Cause earth's profaned womb to groan, Echidna's brood to cry! Lo! here the blood of the black bull Drips towards thee from thy mother's hearse; Daughter of earth, be merciful In Hades to our hopes and fears; Art thou not orphaned on thy throne, Far from the happy light that shone, Far from thy ravished maiden zone, Far from thy mother's tears! In the Woods. A sternly subtle horror grew within The deep and shaggy wood; it seemed akin To my sad thoughts; went on with scarce a turn The timber pathway, till a sullen burn Spread sideways like a white and whispering ghost, So rippling into darkness and so lost. Above the swamp the giant trees embrace Like wrestling dragons, underneath the lace Of their broad pennons; here a sullen bough Short-lopped, gleams whitely, threatening through the sough Of all the distant tree-tops, bids me cast My weary expectation here at last. I fall, I sink, beneath the leafy walls, Which clash a little as the water falls From bedded roots, and as the wistful wind Once more bends back the trees: as if a blind Sunbeam dashed yellow o'er the gloomy frond, A strange decay is stealing over yond Sycamore, touching half its leaves with green Of sickly paleness, as I lie between High springing grasses headed with small flowers. The foxglove drops the bell the bee devours, And lo! a keener pang in my lost peace Speaks meaningly; the woodland terrors cease As the wild bee from the deserted bell Hums fiercely forth; the stern clouds upward swell, The ghostly water whispers now no more, The twining trees are hidden on the shore, As the light dies too; rolling rank on rank, The waves of darkness swallow up in blank Submersion all things: then within my soul Awoke a harmony that blent the whole Of life—can death do more, shall death do less? O soul of my past life! the bitterness Of thy past pain hurts not the thing I am In this deep hour; the senses cannot cram The spirit with fresh food for memories; No object now to eye or ear can rise, And so the spirit settles into peace Self-drawn, or drawn from Him who makes to cease All trouble, and the inmost spirit bids Consist in peace; who nightly seals our lids For this, and gives us timely hours like those, When even the heart the spirit's calm o'erflows. With whitest robes, whenever death shall come, Shall both his hands be filled. We travel home. Love's Consolation. BY THE MONK OF OSNEYFORD. The thorn-tree keeps its leaves for ever green All the year round; and when the wind blows keen, And strips all trees the summer's pride and chief, This holdeth fast, and will not quit one leaf. Likewise when Christ had worn the thorny crown, That year the sorry thorn-tree trickled down With drops of blood, and ever since hath worn Those bleeding berries in its leaves of thorn. Wherefore all doleful lovers prize that tree, Both for its sorrow and its constancy; And all they say that it is good to wear Its leaves so sharp and green upon their hair, As Christ did then; for Christ who loved us died In love of us, and whoso would abide His baptism, must in loving die also, That life may rise again from deathly woe. It is great marvel to me that I keep My hand in writing tales of love and sleep, And life and God; for long ago has ceased The stir of things in me; I stand released A long time now from all that coil severe Which knitteth heart to heart: I have grown clear Perchance in watching our old Abbot's eyes, Burn softly like a dove's, when he replies To us who ask his blessing in the hall: He gives the same old gift to great and small, Just peering with his old mouth and white hair At what you are, a moment; and, you swear, As instantly forgetting: howsoe'er The quiet of our life here day by day Has somehow won on me to put away All other thought save to write on and on, Between the prayer times, as if life were gone In threescore years for me as from the rest; Alas! that earnest e'er should grow a jest! So let me reason how I first began To write my tales in praise of those who ran Furthest in love; of what did set me on To make my body lean, and my face wan In praising that which was my utter woe A long time past: hear, and ye well shall know That I fulfil my life in writing well Of love and God, and life, the tales I tell. It being then the happy Christmas time, And all the orchards thick with frosty rime, I took me by the happy paths that go Along the dumb and frozen river, so That I might taste the goodness of the day; Passing through many meadows on my way, Where all the grass and flowers were dead asleep, Through many sheepfolds full of bleating sheep, By many watercourses, whereby grew The little-headed willows, two and two, And also poplars: onward thus I sped, Until the pathway reached a little head Of brushwood, screening up a wicket gate, Whereat I entered, and beheld elate A wide and scattered wood of late-leaved beech And oaks and thorn-trees, standing on the reach Of long-withdrawing glades: at sight of these And the snow-dabbled grass, and broken knees Of large red ferns in patches, as I went, Felt I great exaltation and consent Unto the sweetness of the place and day: The robin called the merle, who was away, And yet the robin answered from his bough: The squirrel dropt from branch to branch, although Few leaves did screen him; and with frequent bounds The rabbits visited each others' mounds, And o'er the dead leaves pattered. Thus I went Until I reached a little thorn-tree bent— A thorn-tree knotted like a human throat, Set so, and all its leaves together smote Out the resemblance of a saddened face Raised on two knotty arms, thrust, as for grace, Among wild hair: the tree was such I saw, And crossed the glades for, thinking with much awe About the time of year; for in seven days Would be the shortest day; and last year's haze Rose all about me then; last year that day Found I that I was given all away For nought; and all that winter had I gone In loneliness, and when the summer shone, Sadder was I to see the buds drawn out On the long branches till they tossed about In perfect flower; making me but more sad To see the sweet completeness all things had. And I remember, sleeping in my bed, A mighty clap of thunder shook my head About laburnum time; and I awoke And watched the lightning make a great white stroke Three hours above the poplar tops, and then Came morning and the writing of a pen Telling me that my love and reverence Three days before had sold herself for pence Unto a clown who riches had in store; Yea, sold herself for that three days before. Ah! Lord, thy lightnings should have wakened me Three nights before they did: more bitterly Was nothing ever done; and all the moons The golden apples ripened, came long swoons Of utter woe and trouble, shot across By roaring and sad weeping for my loss. Nor found I quiet till the autumn time Was finished, and brought back the frosty rime; And knights rode forth to quest upon the leas, And seek adventure underneath the keys Of the bare ash-trees, and by wayside stones, And where roads met; and then I thought my moans Had been ill-spent, and half my pain was crime; For while I was lamenting all the time, I might have been at tennis, or have made Six pictures, or twelve stories; so I said. Love hath great store of sweetness, and 'tis well; A moment's heaven pays back an age of hell: All who have loved, be sure of this from me, That to have touched one little ripple free Of golden hair, or held a little hand Very long since, is better than to stand Rolled up in vestures stiff with golden thread, Upon a throne o'er many a bowing head Of adulators; yea, and to have seen Thy lady walking in a garden green, Mid apple blossoms and green twisted boughs, Along the golden gravel path, to house Herself, where thou art watching far below, Deep in thy bower impervious, even though Thou never give her kisses after that, Is sweeter than to never break the flat Of thy soul's rising, like a river tide That never foams; yea, if thy lady chide Cruelly thy service, and indeed becomes A wretch, whose false eyes haunt thee in all rooms, 'Tis better so, than never to have been An hour in love; than never to have seen Thine own heart's worthiness to shrink and shake, Like silver quick, all for thy lady's sake, Weighty with truth, with gentleness as bright. Moreover, let sad lovers take delight In this, that time will bring at last their peace: We watch great passions in their huge increase, Until they fill our hearts, so that we say, “Let go this, and I die;” yet nay and nay, We find them leave us strangely quiet then, When they must quit; one lion leaves the den, Another enters; wherefore thus I cross All lovers pale and starving with their loss. And yet, and yet, and yet, how long I tore My heart, O love! how long, O love! before I could endure to think of peace, and call For remedy, from what time thou didst all Shatter with one bad word, and bitter ruth Didst mete me for my patience and my truth. That way thou hadst: once, cutting like a knife, Thy hand sheared off what seemed my very life, And I felt outside coldness bite within: The lumpish axe that scales away false skin Of some corruption clumped upon the bark, Leaves the tree aching with the pale round mark, And sweating till the wound be overshot By the gums swelling out into a blot, Where the bees lose their wings, and dead leaves stick. Even so, O love, my flesh was sore and quick From that astonishment, when I seemed flayed, Torn piecemeal up, and shred abroad, and made A victim to some brutal lack of skill; Yet kissing still the hand so rough to kill. So, so; I never meant but to live on The old, old way; now the old life is gone— Has it?—and left me living! This I thought, Kneeling before the thorn-bush, over fraught With many memories, when I saw the sweet Red berries hanging in it, and its feet Rolled up in withered moss; also I saw Birds sit among its sharp green leaves and caw. Gently I drew a branch of berries down, And severed it to be my very own, And on a pine log, lying full hard by, Cast I myself and looked upon the sky. Oh, then behold a glorious vision fair, Which came to comfort me in that despair; Branched in the clouds I saw a mighty tree, As dearly twisted as the thorn, as free, As kindly wild, clear springing through the green Fields of the frosty Orient, and between Four great hills rooted, where the earth upreared Herself into the sky; and as this cleared I looked towards the thorn-tree standing there, So happy, with the woods about all bare, And then nine gentle forms did I behold— Five men and four sweet ladies, as I told— All walking towards me, with a gentle pace, Round from the thorn, all with full solemn face, And head bent solemnly: to me they came, One led the band, the rest led each his dame. The first who came waved forth a long green wand, Whereat the others in fair show did stand Divided, four on either side, a knight And queen together, on the left and right. Those knights had golden crowns upon their heads, And their long hair drawn out with golden threads, And rightly were they harnessed, and each bore A coronal of thorn leaves, with good store Of berries red, which shone like drops of wine Amongst the green leaves and the gold wire fine. Those four queens wore the thorn-leaves; I saw there Red berries spread about upon their hair: Their crisped tresses hung more clear and fine Than yellow amber holding gold-red wine; Their looks were wildly gentle, and more fair Than full-eyed fawn just shaken from her lair; Wild looks of sorrow, wildly worn and past; Wild looks of wild peace, wildly won at last: One wore a white robe, like a thin white cloud, Through which strange drops of crimson slowly ploughed; One wore a white robe with a crimson seam, In which strange quivering shapes did hang and gleam; One wore a robe of dark deep violet, In which, like eyes, gold passion-flowers were set; One wore a robe of saffron, shot and stained With willow leaves, and wolfsbane purple-veined: Each stood contented, with a tender white Hand in the reverent holding of a knight. At sight of this fair worship I had dropped Upon my knees, and then uprose and stopped, Until they stood more near, and then again Knelt down before them, being very fain To gaze upon their glory all so nigh. Then he who led them, with a bitter sigh, Began to chide me gently for my fault In leaving love, and making that revolt From him, since not a man shall miss reward From love, who pays true service and regard. “Ah, sir,” said I, “how in God's truth and mine, How I have loved, never canst thou divine. If I blame love I do not scorn his might, And have no other done in love than right. Nay, I so truly dealt with my false dame, And spent such pains, that many cried her shame Because she paid me nought for my long quest. I hold that love lights love in gentle breast; Now hath she left me nought but scorn and loss. Oh, never meet with love; oh, never cross A fair false face to torture all your thoughts, For ever brooding, fiend-like, on the thwarts Of all the paths you move in; better far To wage with fortune such a cruel war As makes all joy to be a sin and crime: Oh, to live rankly were a blessed time In such a beggar's filth and press of wants As gives no leave for wasting royal grants Of love upon some brainless beauty-snare, As sweet as false: so he is sure to fare, Who trusts a woman,—save the worship sweet Of these dear ladies, who with pity meet My cursed complaining: can I not suppress Some bitterness of soul, this tide and stress?” “Thou shalt not need,” replied his sovereign voice; “Behold how they with pity droop in poise Of their sweet heads; for drop by drop thy rain Has filled their cups, until they stoop and drain Upon the ground their fulness—thy bestowing; Then rise,—unemptied, but no more o'erflowing. Ah! lilies, ah! sweet friends, weep not so sore; He who can rail in love hath yet good store Of lightness left him, whensoe'er he take Good counsel, good advisement, and awake Unto himself, see what he hath, let pass This frenzy, this lewd mist blown on the glass Wherein his clear eyes should behold themselves. Now take this counsel from me: wise man delves In his own heart for comforts; never seeks Outside himself; and falls not when fate wreaks Herself on what he hath, but cannot smutch That which he is: he hath his creed; not much To say, but cons it shortly, and so holds: Being forearmed, 'tis drawing fast the folds Of mail that hung unrivetted for air. Hast not thou such a creed? thou hast? prepare To hear me con it to thee, lest thou cause Ladies weep for thee; nay, shouldst make a pause In nature's kindness for thee, and go mad, And swash about in madness, thinly clad, A violent creature sinning. Think this o'er: Wouldst in a vase of many crannies pour And say the liquor should not flow throughout, But keep in certain hollows? Have no doubt Up to its level it will flood the whole: So does the tide of love o'erflood the soul Admitting it, and so to dumbness fill With very fulness; thou canst not distil Into the air one sound not muffled up In love; as after being filled, the cup Gives not its crystal echo to the stroke The same as empty: now in furious smoke Thy love hath whirled itself away, and left The vessel of thy nature all bereft And emptied quite: now therefore it is due, That it ring out its ancient tone as true As at the first, ring loud and merrily, Singing of old things in the time gone by, Most precious to thy heart, recalling all, With little pain for what is past recall.” “O gentle ladies! I have worship done,” I answered, “even when I made my moan; O knights! I long had known your name and state, Had not this lay prevented, with debate Of my st this: now tell me who ye be, Which I in part already seem to see.” “Nine lovers are we, who have lost our loves, Alike we are in that, and us behoves To hold together, for by unhappiness, Not by our fault, we fell beneath the press Of the monster time, that ever coils about The universe, and beats life in and out, Being one living flail, and quick and fierce, And full of hideous fancies: sometimes steers His bulk straight onwards to the flying life, With blood-fret head produced before the grife Wave of his monster trunk, as shoots a spar Of some wave-wallowing wreck before the far Rush of the savage tides that urge it on; Sometimes o'ertakes his prey, and straight is gone In one quick flash of serpent head, and tongue, And eyes, and then surrounds, and lashes strong His sinewy tail before the victim's eyes, In hideous gambols; all the while snake-wise, His head is japing close behind. Now we Were played with thus: Jules there, who secretly Torments the hand of Ellen till he grow To feel a need of her, enough to know That no one can replace his need of needs; And Ellen, knowing well that still she feeds With her own heart a fire that Jules can ne'er Become the food for; Mark, who in despair Long ago calm holds only by the cross Upon his sword, and thinks not of his loss, Save joined with all that God must be; Lucrece, Whose eyes now gain beginnings of great peace, Watching her thin hands and the flowers they hold; Gilbert, who stands half ruffled, feeling bold To say and do what he would never do Were the time come; Madoline looking so Having done great self-sacrifice in love, Yet thinking rather of the cost than of The joy that should be hers from nobleness; Miles, whose eyes pale before the glorious dress Of Columbe's hair, but she means nought for him, Nor he indeed for her; they scarcely dream. All these are waiting ever—we all wait— For some completion to fill up the date Of life as yet unfinished; yet I say, Perhaps in vain, as thou too; best are they Who love their life in all things: is not life Its own fulfilment? Steadfast marble rife With knotty veins, like thoughts, inscrutable, Broods on the altar's frontel, takes the spell Of every taper pure caressing it, Of every sun that warms the shadow-fit From its pale, tranquil, capable, cold face; Lives under sun and shadow, lets light trace Its crumbled grain, and darkness thicken on't, Struck blind by neither, neither is its want. Man should do more than marble; make meet change For day and night within himself, estrange His heart from nought that meets him, even laugh When bitter roots are given him to graff Upon joy's stem, yea, even if it bear Yew leaves and berries weighty on the air, And dropping on the sleek soil underneath, Where dead things rankle,—'tis a bloom from Death, And true souls always are hilarious, They see the way-marks on their exodus From better unto better; still they say, Lo! the new law, when old things pass away; Still keep themselves well guarded, nothing swerve From the great purposes to which they serve Scarce knowingly; still smile and take delight In arduous things, as brave men when they fight Take joy in feeling one another's might. Ah! now, poor wounded man, drag not thy coils In shattered volume sadly through the toils, Backward and forward, tearing more and more Each torn quick part, and adding to the sore That earth-clods stick in, like a mangled worm. There is one way for thee; but one; inform Thyself of it; pursue it; one way each Soul hath by which the infinite in reach Lieth before him; seek and ye shall find: To each the way is plain; that way the wind Points all the trees along; that way run down Loud singing streams; that way pour on and on A thousand headlands with their cataracts Of toppling flowers; that way the sun enacts His travel, and the moon and all the stars Soar; and the tides move towards it; nothing bars A man who goes the way that he should go; That which comes soonest is the thing to do. Thousand light-shadows in the rippling sand Joy the true soul; the waves along the strand Whiten beyond his eyes; the trees tossed back Show him the sky; or, heaped upon his track In a black wave, wind-heaped, point onward still His one, one way. O joy, joy, joy, to fill The day with leagues! Go thy way, all things say, Thou hast thy way to go, thou hast thy day To live; thou hast thy need of thee to make In the hearts of others; do thy thing; yes, slake The world's great thirst for yet another man! And be thou sure of this; no other can Do for thee that appointed thee of God; Not any light shall shine upon thy road For other eyes; and thou mayest not pursue The track of other feet, although they drew Lucidly o'er wide waters, like the dip Of speeding paddles, like the diamond drip Of a white wing upon a lake struck dead With shadows; no, though the innumerous head Of flowers should curtain up the foot that falls. Thou shalt not follow; thee the angel calls, As he calls others; and thy life to thee Is precious as the greatest's life can be To him ; so live thy life, and go thy way. Now we have gained this knowledge by essay, In part; some struggling yet, for we all thought To gain another, hand in hand, upcaught, Drawn onwards our soul's path; and of us some About our hearts meshed the loved hair with comb Of our great love, to twine and glisten there, And when 'twas stiffened in our life blood dear, Then was it rent away; (ah! so with thee;) We learn to pardon those who could not be A part of us, their way lying different; And learn to waste no grief on our intent Thus warped; but live on bravely; tend the sore Just at odd moments, when it oozes gore Less sufferably: how our eyes draw fire From the fire fount of pain! Our wounds grow drier, And memories walk beside us, as a shade Walks by a great magician in his trade, When deep night falls on all the paths, and he Discourses to his friend, invisibly Accompanied; our memories walk by us, Stand by us, when we look on others thus, Face upon face; steal from us half our thoughts, Flake after flake; us therefore it imports To make them our good servants, as the mage Uses his shadows upon service sage. O faithful gobetweens! knit each to each; O memories! give to dead lips living speech, Limbs motion, eyes their spirit-pulse; bestow On everything its value; grow and glow A white intensity of chastest flame, That all things may but seem to make the same Great undulation of a wave of heaven That flowed to us; so giving and so given, May we pass on to death! Now, therefore, write Tales of our true love; both of those who quite Bootlessly thought that love unto their love Must knit itself; and those who, happier, strove Only with fortune, overcast at length By death alone, and walking in the strength Of meat long eaten in the desert since. First act is over, and the next begins, Yet proves the same again, for us and thee. What next? Why, all is ended.” “Plaudite Remains,” I cried, “though your five tragic acts That should have been, are shortened: fate enacts A two-act farce, the dream and the awaking.” “Farewell,” said he, “give largely; we are staking A little on thy mercy. Do thou write; Let thine eye soften o'er the page; let spite, And hate, and over-sadness die away; Thou shalt see others calming in the sway Of all within them. Love, too, blossoms out More perfectly from agony and doubt; Hath wider ranges, and a kind of laugh At human things in him; in short, can quaff Easier of joy; can grasp the world and use; Is kindlier to all living life; would lose Not one process of nature; but o'erspreads In genial current all things; hath no dreads, No hates, no self-tormenting; cherishes, Blesses, and gives great teaching, for it frees: Thus much more precious is love's after-birth.” Wind and much wintry blue then swept the earth. Waiting. By the ancient sluice's gate Here I wait, here I wait; Here is the sluice with its cramped stone, Which the shadows dance upon. Here I wait. Stone, with time-blots red and blue, And white, the shadows tremble through, When the sun strikes out through the poplars tall, And the sun strikes out upon the wall. Here I wait. From the sluice the stream descends A bowshot; then its running ends In flags and marsh flowers; then it runs Bright and broad beneath the suns. Here I wait. And to one side of it come down The walls and roofs of our good town; The other side for miles away The willows prick it short and grey. Here I wait. Any moment I might see My lady in her majesty Moving on from tree to tree Where the river runs from me. Here I wait. Any moment she might rise From the hedgerow, where my eyes Wait for her without surprise, While the first bat starts and flies. Here I wait. Here I lie along the trunk That swings the heavy sluice-door sunk In the water, which outstreams In little runlets from its seams. Here I wait. The last yellowhammer flits, The winds begin to shake by fits; More coldly swing the mists and chase: Thinking of my lady's face Here I wait. Like a tower so standeth she, Built of solid ivory; Her sad eyes well opened be, Her wide hair runs darkly free. Here I wait. Her eyes are like to water-birds On little rivers, and her words As little as the lark, which girds His wings to measure out his words. Here I wait. Here the crows come flying late— One flies past me; past the gate Of the old sluice another flies; Heavily upwards they do rise. Here I wait. I am growing thoughtful now; Will she never kiss my brow? Solemnly I sit and feel The edge upon my sword of steel. Here I wait. If she come, her feet will sound Not at all upon the ground; I think upon thy feet, my love, Red as feet of any dove. Here I wait. Here my face is white and cold, Here my empty arms I fold; Here float down the beds of weeds, With the fly that on them feeds. Here I wait. A Nun's Story—Modern Rome. Before the great house on the Palatine The blood as yet is purple on the vine, Nor has it faded from the leather belt On which 'twas poured when cursed Guido dealt Last night his blow. Ah, Guido! down below Lorenzo's grave they're digging by a row Of broken wine-jars on the cellar shelf; And there the snow-white body keeps itself; And here above does Lady Catherine sit, And watch the vine that points to her and it: Two stories has the vine—her ear to please— Two lovers walk beneath a cirque of trees Which closes round a pool of water-lilies, Whose bank so steep almost a little hill is; And she will gather one of those white flowers— No danger, yet his very spirit cowers At thought of it for her; upon his knees He nerves himself, and holds her hand in his; Then forth they walk in bliss, but after them A staggering shadow steals, a flashing gem Curves through the dusky air,—Lorenzo falls, Dyeing the grass; then to these cloistered halls They drag her, force the habit o'er her head, And leave her senseless on her novice bed. These are the vine's two stories; just awake, She hears them for the first time, scarcely quake Her eyes, but gaze far, far beyond the hills In meditation how the deep air fills With sea-like purple all the hollow land. Poor angel! quickly wilt thou understand, Oft wilt thou hear them with a wild despair Too awful, writhing, shuddering, sobbing there,— Would thou couldst die; and yet, if souls can guess, I think that o'er death's purple haziness A great white cloud is floating, heavenly fair, On which she sits, as purely white; her hair Blessed with the rainbow, and her feet just dipped In the dark flood beneath; and, lo! now slipped From some high heaven his spirit headlong falls, To clasp her round the neck; alas! it palls, And the long years by moments 'gin to fly— Alas! poor angel, would that thou couldst die! A Monk's Story. I saw to-day a man upon his back Beneath a tree, watching the sailing track Of quails and pigeons in the smoke-blue sky; And as their wings dipt deeper or more high Above the shining leaves, I knew the man With dizzying eyes more thoughtfully would scan The heaven's blue burning till he fell asleep, For all the day the heavens with light grow deep. I knew that if a bittern or a quail With shortened wings and pouncing feet should sail Down through the air and settle on the tree, The man would sleep no more, but suddenly Spring up and drag his bow-case from his head. Behold me in the life I sometime led! I know not how I sinned: what man can know All he has sinned? but very long ago, In the beginning of my bootless tale, Found I myself weeping without avail, As who begins to live, and with a sense Of long, long love, now reaching prevalence. One lay beside me on a little mound, Marsh marigolds and river reeds were round, And three hours ere the snnset, and not far A river rippling over a sandbar; Gleaming the spacious shallows of its tide, As if the moving were a breeze inside; The purple shadows trembling through and through, Above, around us, who were trembling too. Who lay beside me on the little mound? My hands were beating on the harmless ground: Weeping, why wept I in the golden air, So passioned in the depths of what despair? He, strange companion, heeded not at all; Prostrate he lay, as he were past recall For weariness; one knee was bent and raised, And ever upwards at the blue he gazed Where small white clouds went on. How bitter-sweet, How bitter; but I will not use deceit, I will not hide, nor tell how, after this Long years, betrayed by a Judas kiss, Sent me kiss-stung and madding through the world: For who would curse? Have I found peace upcurled In yond volumen I illuminate? I will not bid my saint a moment wait, Whilst I in his grim acts interpolate A weaker man and unappointed fate. So there's my monogram in silence put Upon the page in which my life is—shut: And when ye take my volume from the shelves, And stare upon it while ye cross yourselves, Think thus upon the painter, simple friends:— He was a man at quiet war with fiends, Ora pro animâ, he painted here: This is a morn in spring; how high uprear To meet the blue our white-brown convent walls, And from them a translucent shadow falls O'er half the cell; and what a diaper The little leaves and branches all astir With sunshine, pour upon the picture screen! He painted here, happy he must have been; He was a good man and did visions see, A quiet man without a history; Think thus, and pity me, and pray for me. Ay, and this morn in spring, midst this design To which I thought was given this life of mine, Stirring the quiet sunshine of my cell, Something across the blazoned parchment fell: A shadow, not flung down from swinging bough, I caught it; 'twas the arching of a brow, And gloss of purple hair was what I saw, And stealing footsteps, which could not withdraw: What! she, that trembler whom one sees about Our gates, who bows and tries to look devout? And he, our latest joined, whose flesh is weak? Well, sin no more; I am not one to speak. Ballad. Lord Robert and fair Ellen both Came flying on a horse of might: They left five brethren on the ground Before they fled from hall that night. The first river they came unto, It did but wet the horse's feet: It was as sad as the ashes of fire; Long time they tarried in its street. “And oh! fair Ellen,” Lord Robert said, “I had slain but four instead of five!” “Now rest thee well, Lord Robert,” she said, “For thou and I are here alive.” The next river they came unto It went up to the horse's knees; The ice was broken all about; It shone like the sun on the leaves of trees. “And would for thy sake we both had died, Before I stood within thy bower!” “I greeted thee well, Lord Robert,” she said, “And better to think of the sweet than the sour.” The third river they came unto To the middle of the flank increased; The ice was sailing all around, It shone like the sun on the fell of a beast. “Ah! where is thy false nurse Jan this night, Who kept the watch above thy bower?” “Nurse Jan needs watch no more,” she said, “And better to think of seed than sower.” The next river they rode unto, Over the wither-band did break; The ice did break on fair Ellen's foot, It shone like the sun on a coiling snake. “We never have met, I swear to thee, Alas! and we are woe together.” “Have courage, my lord,” fair Ellen said, “We two shall merrily win this weather.” The next river they came unto, The stream ran over the horse's flank; The ice poured down from side to side, It shone like shore-grass dry and lank. He never spake a word again, But drew her arm right through his own; She bent her white hand in his hand, Until it pressed on his breast-bone. The next river they came unto, It rose up to the horse's head; A fire upon the midst did burn, The waves like rolling meadows spread. The ice rolled heavily about, Like briny monsters of the sea: He drew her round him on the horse, And there they two well buried be. La Faerie, or Lovers' World. Argument. —Mark, while uncertain about his own destiny, sees La Faerie in a dream, and hears two of its inhabitants relate their story in conversation with one another. Their union had been opposed, the lover unwillingly slew a rival of whom he had no fears, and after three years killed himself, on a report of the lady's forced marriage. On his death the lady retired to a convent, and after nine years died. I Sat Mark within the shadow of a gloom Made by his banner hung against the sun, Woven blue and green; beside him in the room Another chair, whereon were made to run Strange beasts, and on the top a white, white dove Strained always its spread wings towards that serene Heaven of the banner woven blue and green. II At that time went the clouds from far above, Wind-grouped, to pause with golden ministries About the sun; at that time no remove From very life were those hued images And whelming sounds one has who dreams, yet wakes, Musing about the inmost core of things, The land of wonder and its splendorings. III About high hills embowering endless lakes, About strange mariners on savage shores, About sea-billows swelling with huge aches, About black murders done on secret moors, About the panic dances in the night, About stern booming sounds in solitudes, And moon-made goblins seen in shuddering woods. IV To Mark that sunset shaped its end aright, Coming to this, that in the chair by Mark His lady sat, no later than last night, When they two sat together until dark, He, kissing at her shadow in his heart, She, perfect in her hues; he, heart-elate; Both silent, like the love-bird and its mate. V We nothing understand for our sad part How what has been, becomes what is to be: We wake from cabin dreams with bodeful start And find ourselves at welter in the sea; So miserable, prayer might feel afraid Of God, except that ever Fancy leaves Some slippery trail of joy while she deceives. VI Now on Mark's eyes a husky shadow preyed, In which his eyeballs smouldered black and fierce; And presently he bit his banner's braid, Straining it tighter lest some glint should pierce And make less holy that which was his thought: He would as soon have spoken of his dreams As opened them to unabated beams. VII So onward fares in dreams till he is brought To life and death, in summit of them both; Tottering upon half thoughts, pale, scarcely raught, Clinging upon him, frantical to clothe Their thinness in the shadow substances In which his soul was ravelled, tissue-wise,— Live memories, sweetest thoughts, and glad surprise. VIII Now hither, moonbeams, in your essences Fading from night, ere night herself can close: Now Boreals, splintered on ice palaces In twenty sunsets and a million glows; Now hither all sweet lights and ravishments Of colour, primes, and germs, and slow decays, And stealing time-marks, and uncertain sways. IX And vast and mighty overfalls and rents In tawny clouds, through which the pale sun shows A revelation—give me sacraments Of poetry to swear on; for by those, And other such-like mighty mysteries Dream-born, dream-nursed, my lady's life hath grown To be the marvel we shall gaze upon. X Whence cometh she? for sure again his eyes Are fed on her, the chair again enfolds His love, his sweetest; yet he scarce descries His lady in the shadow he beholds; His lady there, not perfect in her hues, Too pale for her; but ere his passion speaks, The crimson, flagging slowly to her cheeks, XI There fluctuates in tongues of flame that use Their splendours on the heart's weak blood to feed: Back, forward, backward; utterly suffuse The heavenly places where it is their need; And now the circles of sweet violet Are traced beneath her mystical blue eyes: Oh, let her lift them ere her lover dies! XII My lady lives in perfect glory set, My lady lives all perfect in her hues, And is yon orb La Faërie, which doth fret With little glints the stillness which doth muse, And lightens vainly on her presence meek Yet mighty in its saddened majesty,— A statue always heaving with a sigh! XIII Herewith that lover felt his passion speak, Beginning, “An angel out of paradise,” Yet marks her lips apart ere he can wreak The pains within him on the ecstacies; And she is shaken through her presence sweet, Yet on he breaks impetuous: “Rosalys!” (First to pronounce that music be it his), XIV “O love! O love! O sweet! let me but meet Thy hand in mine, and we shall be the thing That poets sing of in their highest heat, And, therefore, more than poets, journeying— Oh! thus and thus; I bless thee, thus and thus: I'll bear thee, dearest, tenderly alive, Where'er yon orb of swiftness shall arrive. XV “For see, it grew most largely over us, Put forth two wings, and glowed with presences, Shaking with spangles, thronged, tumultuous, With happy faces, like the waves of seas, Still changing as it moved, and one serene Bright ray of redness touched upon thy face, Then vanished starlike, with a final trace XVI “Of blue that glided swiftly into green; It is La Faërie, that happy place; And all those happy faces we have seen Are lovers proved and worthy of their grace. I take this token for our summoning; Wherefore, O love, 'tis now to flee away, Leaving the dead world and the dying day.” XVII This passion was a dream, I think, to cling About the heart, and never come to deed; There are some passions which do only ring An inward voice, and inly are decreed; This passion faded quickly, being spent Before the coming on of words wherein Its argentine completedness to win. XVIII But this no dream, that ever as he leant Full-browed towards her, swift as is the flight Of white doves from some resting eminent Towards the green beneath, where they alight After one cleaving of the air with wings, Two lovers, as they seemed, together sped Down through the still air in the twilight spread, XIX Coming as from La Faërie, which with rings Of amethyst darker belting its thick blues And hinted greens, across heaven's quarterings, Beyond the sunset pours its bickering hues, Like runes, and fuses all things to the point, Where all things seem to keep good company, And yet may change, nor lose one just degree. XX Those lovers twain, be very sure, did join 't, That fellowship of beauty, and they sat In front of all its harmonies; Aroynt, You could not say at such a time as that To any evil thing, for there was nought But seemed at one with all things, no surprise In that vast scape of mingled forms and dyes. XXI Presently ran a thread of talk inwrought Into the silence, which was musical, From those paired lips, rich-purpled, overfraught With kisses, hanging only till the fall Of converse: then she answered unto him:— “All that long time they were tormenting me, My lips formed silently the name of thee. XXII “Those three with their pressed brows curved, and the rim Of their long eyes settled in watchful scorn; And he, who could not, like them, always dim His fury in the cruel system, worn By them, of scorn, which masked a killing rage; Sisters and father: spite of scorn and blame, My lips were curving ever with thy name. XXIII “And so I kept me, looking not on age Defaced with fury, nor on that tiger-like Contempt crouched ring on ring! a weary stage Of life it was;—one watching how to strike, One silent in prevention; once alone Did they surprise me. Shall I tell you it, That triumph of those cruel women's wit? XXIV “My strife was at its height a day, when one Of them came pitying to me, that she knew And sorrowed for my heart; her softened tone Touched me as the baked earth is touched by dew; Wherefore I loosened from my hold on calm, Suddenly fluttered in half joy, half shame, And broke my heart in uttering out thy name. XXV “Whereat they laughed from ambush, and her palm Smote me to redness on my cheek; for me, I wept along, regardless, on my arm, Amidst the laughter of the cruel three.” “O love, O suffering love!” Can I rehearse How they two kissed in memory of her wrong? Then took she up her sequel like a song. XXVI “Until the old man leaped out with a curse, To see me in my constant weeping there, Making confession, bearing all his worse, Because my better gave me grace to spare; So drove me home in my still place to yearn.” He.—“We met.” She.—“Yes, yes.” He.—“Ah, after that you gave Dear prayers to me to pity and to save. XXVII “Yet after wouldst not, dearest, in my turn, Though I prayed, lover-like, with eye and lip; I chill, I chill; thou wouldst not, wouldst not learn My plan; so let that indignation slip, Which should have wrought deliverance. Oh, thou sweet, Why wouldst not listen? Almost am I grieving To think of all that gladness of our leaving.” XXVIII She.—“And yet sometimes it happened us to meet, And sure the sudden rapture of a look, On which we lived whole days in thought, complete In filling up what should have been, partook Of ecstasy, threefold of ecstasy.” He.—“O me! you know not, love, how terrible To see thy heaven; then writhe alone in hell. XXIX “For you, as women can, went tranquilly Among them all; I knew not how you beat To fold me closely, as I beat for thee; You left me always maddening in my heat.” She.—“Well, well, sometimes we met.” He.—“Yes, yes, we met; Once when the olives, like blue smoke, were faint, I saw you coming towards me, like a saint. XXX “How you were there, I there, I know not; let This knowledge serve; how anguishing we clung On one another; 'twas something, that.” She.—Ah! fret No more; bethink thee of that time you swung Up to my window, and that pale, pale lad Watching you in and out; and never spoke, Nor crossed your path, but looked as if he woke. XXXI “What joy had he compared with what you had; He, looking for my eyes the whole day long, He, sickening for my hands.” He.—“It makes me mad.” She.—“He ne'er had aught from me—could I belong To two at once? he cast himself away On me and thee.” He.—“It makes me very sad To think of all the bitterness he had.” XXXII She.—“Poor face, poor face! Yes, still I see the glow On his lithe lips whenever I came near; Give love for love, at last he said; and No I answered, but I stroked his long lank hair, And that was well.” He.—“'Twas well.” She.—“And then my sire Cut me with querulous curses, and the three Sprang from their tiger-lair, and tore at me. XXXIII “Had they not so, I know not but the wire Of pity had been strung to love for him: Therefore we do not blame them.” He.—“No, suspire With pity for that phantom grey and grim; Once was our meeting in the narrow street, Thy sire chafed fiercely, palsying with his sword At mules and servants, as became a lord. XXXIV “You, gold and velvet falling to your feet, You, golden cinctures floating round your head; And still the crowd drove us together, sweet, I saw but you amid the hustling tread Of those sworn servitors and their fierce chief, Who thrust right furiously against my breast, And clutched upon and tore aside my vest. XXXV “Were the three with you then?” She.—“Another grief We had, that sometimes if we heard a bell, Or all things shook together in change, or if Some splendour just seen vanished as it fell From heaven with sweet superb upon the green, We saw, and saw not, sickened, all in vain, We cried aloud, as children cry in pain.” XXXVI He.—“Yes; one time in the church, I think you mean, In my sick longing for your face I watched How one sat always reading in the screen A book of saints where gold and crimson matched; And lo! you came, yet came not: shadow-shade Darkened upon the windows, and a trance Baffled me for a moment in its dance. XXXVII “Like to a blind man holding out his head To solemn night, one sat within the porch, Who starting at some noise which had been made, At that time, I remember, in the church, Turned slowly his look inwards with his eyes Full, yet of dreamlight, oh! so weird and wan, Still musing of the thing he dreamed upon. XXXVIII “I would have passed, knowing him, but sighs, Which either breathed, made pause between us twain, We looked at one another; his surprise Grew full within him; but the sense of pain Steadied him, and his words came hot and fast— ‘Thou canst not love, thou dost not love, as I, I seek for death, the one of us shall die!’ XXXIX “Well, I was sad; and yet I would have passed; And yet my sword was out; his sword swung thick Hissing about my head; I struck at last, And felt my sword slide instant to the quick, Then drag through bitten flesh, all wet and cold; His blood spun out and burst against the wall; I listened afterwards to hear it fall. XL “Thence thrice had new things swallowed up the old, Thrice had the summer boughs drooped down with song, Three summers had consumed spring's manifold Incenses in their fervid censers hung, And it was now the autumn yellow-haired, When died I for thy love; for they had said Three years before that you perforce were wed. XLI “Three years I saw you never, yet I spared To slay myself, and then it was enough; I ne'er should see you, and no longer cared; Joyfully died I, thus I gave rebuff To the foul lie that hankered in my brain, That love was dead within me, for I knew 'Twas still in me that love should pierce me through. XLII “Even as of old when thrilled I with sweet pain Of love, but now the old love, overborne By faces new and those long years, seemed fain To lurk in secret places and to mourn Its potence lost; and yet I knew full well That it was there, and might revive at once, If anything should touch it for the nonce, XLIII “If any breath should breathe that ancient spell, If any look should give thy face recall; But still the occasion came not which should quell The unmeaning present, and 'twas natural That I should die, for such a life was death,— That I should let my sluggish soul have scope To find despair, since it abandoned hope. XLIV “Oh! one might live in anguish, and draw breath Of liquid flame, unshrinking; but to feel The heart freeze harder, while o'erflourisheth The life of sense, and that to uncongeal, Awaits the blindness of some accident, This is the death indeed. Ah! who would wend Through years of lifeless life to such an end?” XLV She.—“But thrice three years were counted in event Of patience strong in its grave monotone; Nine solemn years fell over, ere I leant To give deliverance to my soul outgrown; Nine years the sunbeams saddened into night, Nine years the moonbeams tasted my sad cheek, Nine years the visions left me wan and weak. XLVI “What, you were dead? I died too, and outright I buried me, where might I evermore See visionary change of shadow-light Steal through my prison, telling o'er and o'er The crevices and hues of grey-cold stone, That anguish might be dulled by watching so, And slowly, slower, cease my pulses slow. XLVII “And if at any time some vision lone Should shape towards me, it might solemner Pass over that cold mirror, and be gone Without surprise, joining the wistful stir Of gentle death within me; mystical I watched the moon-forms in the unstirred nights, Trembling upon each other with delights XLVIII “Which touched me to the core, and drew the fall Of tears, soon checked, one flutter and its pause; Dear heart, I cried for thee whene'er the pall Drawn from my heart gave me such sudden cause; A dread time was the day, severe and dull, Ministering of nought, but with the night came hot Reflections from the life which now was not. XLIX “Wherefore I wandered forth by night, brimful Of fiery thought, which ever overbrimmed Like a fire-fountain in its rise and lull, Dewing the fair locks of the vapour-dimmed White-raimented sweet saints who bosomed round; I sought the wild path of the soaring moon, My star, my fate, who gave me all that boon. L “But when she levelled with the horizon's mound Her speckled mirror, speeding fast away, Then every spot and tuft upon the ground, Rounded with shadow, domed and coned, and gray, And shaking with the secrets of the wind, Circled my feet so lovingly, and made Their signs to me, that I no farther strayed; LI Until the lion colour, which had skinned The nether clouds, had left them black and vast In the moon's setting; then too paled and thinned The unshaped purpose which had bound me fast; And all was withered, dark, and gray again; Except that sadness, ere she took her place, Granted me to bemoan my minished space.” LII “‘Then,’ cried I out, impatient in my pain, ‘Earth has her need of heaven, to order right The many wrongs of which she bears the stain: O God! O God of heaven! again 'tis night, Now all things wear their weird and pallid look; I wait for something which will never come; Let the heavens answer; be no longer dumb LIII “It was as when one gazes on a book; Those agonies foredoomed, like weary thought, Came with the power of ravishment, and took The passive nature, which resisted nought, Caught it, and bore it onwards, and anon Let fall, let sink, upon the former state Of intense apathy completing fate. LIV “Now those nine years had all my bloom foredone, And sapped my form, and left me stooped and wan. When those nine years at length upon me shone, Flashed out the strange road I had journeyed on, And towards the end I wondered what the end Would be, astonished at that period Of mad self-torture, the forgotten God LV “By silence making for Himself amends Upon my silence: ‘God,’ I shrieked aloud, ‘My life, my life! oh, give me life to spend, Give back the life I've murdered in the cloud!’ This was my waking; with wild eyes I saw Before me nothing, not one step to take: Ah! best have prayed, still sleeping, not to wake! LVI “No voices anywhere, which is the law; No answer, save the silence of the heaven; No consolation, save the awe in awe; No hope, save portion with the unforgiven; No love, for thy dear image in that hour Seemed loosened from my heart; I groaned, and said, ‘Where art thou, love, now that I am dismayed?’ LVII “But in that winter time I marked the tower Of ashen light—the snow had clad the pine Upon the mountain—how the glens did pour Like cataracts downwards towards the gorged ravine, Leap after leap, snow-shadow and snow-light, And steppe on steppe; and upwards, pine on pine, The snowy mountain rose up crystalline. LVIII “And panic-struck I watched the changeful height Until the sunset mocked me with its rose, Until that rose was blenched in utter night, And all was gray and barren on the snows. I lay upon a little mound below, I ceased not gazing on the darkened line Where heaven o'erhung the mountain palatine. LIX “And then outwent there, like a whisper's flow, A little stir of light about the sky; The mountain's head came out by touches slow, And the moon took her clouds, and wrought thereby A vision's bed, and presently she came, My star, my fate, all hurried to my sight, And on my weak sense burst the Infinite. LX “Oh, I was lapped in gold, and dipped in flame, Those billowy-bosomed clouds were all aglow With presences, and I beheld the same, Those ministrants came crowding row on row, And in their sovereignties thy face was plain; Flame hands and voices calling me away— I gathered up my soul and left the clay.” LXI Who hath despaired let him despair again; What hath been shall be, and our very life Is reproduction; pleasure's shadow, pain; Earth's destiny, to live and die in strife; Man's reason, but the tracer of God's will, A faint and scarcely faithful shadow thrown From the all-Reason who abides alone. LXII God's reason,—Let alone this evil still; Let heaven still stand above the earth, apart, As though the heaven were brass, inflexible, As though the earth were not the heaven's heart. Mark rose as if from dreams, and sadly prayed, With night's thick darkness poured upon his head; Of him I saw no more: consider this, How long ago died Mark and Rosalys. Mother and Daughter. Hear now, my daughter, what I say; I came into that house one day, The twisting apple-trees were bloom, I sat a long time in that room; The house rose just above the stream Upon the bottom of a seam Of hill that rises high beyond, All bare except the little bond Of apple-yard enclosed behind The house, and all so steep inclined, The highest apple-tree appeared One level with the gable reared; And need had I to think, I ween, The twinkling flax was living green. With fleecy moss and misletoe Those trees will now be gray, I know; But then they had a wondrous glow, Their roots were in the earth below, Their blossom in the heaven above. The blue wind rose and gently clove The pearl-green leafage from the glume, And bore it to the brook to bloom; And need had I to think, I ween, About your gold hair's glorious sheen, Yet not so fair as mine had been; And your eye living in the noon Of life, yet singing no such tune Of life, I thought, as mine did once; Of thee, sweet virgin, for the nonce Unbroken in thy heart, my maid, My virgin, from my bowels flayed. Of thy sweet peace as yet unpained, Of thy sweet mercy yet unstained, Of thy sweet angel yet unfrayed, Of thy sweet service, to be paid, Of thy sweet humour, not yet dim, Of thy sweet blessings made for him; 'Twere need, I ween, to think of these Beneath the apple-trees. His spirit there before me stood, It dropped out of the apple wood, It went before me where I sat, Through the house and past the cat, It passed the brook, it passed the road, But led me towards our old abode; And at the turnstile turned, and saw Me following, then took its law Of vanishing from mortal sight; I kept that way with steady might, And came upon you both, and found What I had wished—his arms around Your golden head, while muttering burned His lips upon your lips upturned. He's dead, and I am forty year; You are a mother now, my dear. The Groomsman. Her bridal feast is fairly set, She smiles with innocence and joy, She smiles into her bridegroom's heart, Innocent girl and happy boy. What pity can she have for me? Why am I here to walk behind, And hold his handkerchief or glove; The vow which gives him heart and life To me but gives a sister's love. What pity can she have for me? All that a man can do is done; I met her in the cedar wood: To all that I could say or pray Her sorrow wept, her purpose stood: What pity can she have for me? And now she smiles: ah! happiness, Thou cruel child, thou bitter joy: She knows not if my heart be rent: Innocent girl and happy boy. What pity can she have for me? Despair. I find myself by a black spring and cold, Which slowly bursts from this rock's heavy head, Like drops of sweat wrung from our God of old, And plashes dead Into a basin hollowed from the mould. I trace this fountain rolling deeply down— Dark is the night, my pathway ruinous— Here foam the muddy billows thick and brown, Then issue thus Into a lake where all the world might drown. I mark the mountains stand about and brood— The lake and they together, God, remain, As black and deep and steep as walls of mud On some vast plain Block out and brood upon a swimming drain. I mark a woman on the farther shore Walk ghost-like; her I shriek to with my might; Ghostlike she walketh ever more and more; Her face how white! How small between us seems the Infinite! I call her, but she ever tacks and veers Like some wan sail that sails in the salt seas Unheeding all the shore's strained eyes and ears; Must this not cease? Ah! hear my cry, dear soul, and give me peace. I call her; never may she heed or note: Is this the end? Just Judge, this place is cursed! Each breath I draw within my beating throat Doth make and burst Bubbles of blood. Death, death! Death last and first. Sonnet. Give me the darkest corner of a cloud, Placed high upon some lonely mountain's head, Craggy and harsh with ruin; let me shroud My life in horror, for I wish me dead. No gentle lowland known and loved of old, Lure me to life back through the gate of tears; But long time drenched with rain and numb with cold, May I forget the solace of the years: No trees by streams, no light and warmth of day, No white clouds pausing o'er the happy town; But wind and rain, and fogbanks slow and gray, And stony wastes, and uplands scalped and brown; No life, but only death in life: a grave As cold and bleak as thine, dear soul, I crave. The Crusader's Monument. Hands at rest Cross my breast, Left arm closes sword to side; Thus I slept When we leapt From the saddle at eventide. Like a tent, My monument Soars o'er me to its height of arch; My burgonet Is rivelled yet, As if against the morrow's march. Morning's beam Strikes a gleam From my shield hung up on high: Had a foe Struck that blow, Should I start to arms and issue try? Here the rood Years hath stood, As it shook over me in the clanging strife; Ah! poor knight, Thou dost fight For holy cross another life. Work was mine In Palestine, When the Paynims howled round me as I lay; Here they pray Night and day, But I fight with long fiends since my dying day. Romance. Look you be sure, Take here the lure; Ride you there, ride you for one two and three. Down the king's fist With the drag of the wrist, Dragged down the pomegranates pierced with the bee. There he sits thinking, Stolid and blinking, While the recorder doth read the decree; Courtiers unto him Talk the thing, view him; There he sits gartered well under the knee. Rightly be swift, Lightly let lift Bridle, and ride to the tower of the sea; On the queen's face Sorrow to trace Seeds of the pomegranate sanguine and free. There she lies faintly, On her breast quaintly Lies her plumed peacock fan; dead she may be: With her together One loosened feather Waves near her mouth: she has drawn up her knee. On to your courser, Spare not his horsehair; Ride to the knight of the tower of the sea; Long ago bade he Carry my lady Into his tower; carry her, carry me. There he sits waiting, Counting and rating Sunflowers that grow by his wall on the lea: Sees the long grasses, Browsed on by asses, While he makes songs with his harp on his knee. Now he is gone; Cross-bolt or stone Swiftlier fled never, think I, than he: Hark how the feet Lessen their beat: Four dies to two; so there, give me the key. There he emerges Close where the verge is; Now he is shot past our furthest off tree: Grant he come back, (Riding not slack,) I, maiden Alice, will stand at his knee. The Judgment of the May. Come to the judgment, golden threads Upon golden hair in rich array; Many a chesnut shakes its heads, Many a lupine at this day, Many a white rose in our beds Waits the judgment of the May. Oh, like white roses, great white queen, Come to the judgment, come to-day. The white stars on thy robes of green Are like white roses on trees in May: By me thy stars and flowers are seen, But now thou seemest far away. Song. Brightly glance the beech-tree tops, The aspen quivers bright; The poplar swings from out the copse And lashes into white. Brightly glance the clover tops, The hedge-rows glisten sweet, Where freely climb the flowering hops, And bells and flower-buds meet. Brightly glance the willow heads, The stream comes gleaming down and raving; Beside it wave the osier beds, But love is more than all their waving. Brightly glance the tops of the oaks, The branch of the ash is black and bitter; Round the sun's blue course the fire-cloud smokes, To me earth's darkness were dearer and fitter. Brightly glance the tops of the broom, Bright swells the thicket's side; The clustering branches give no room: Oh, where may love abide! A Song of Three Maidens. Of maidens three but one I knew, I dream about the other two: Sometimes I dream and then I see My maidens three. When white primrose at last begin'th To yield to wild blue hyacinth, Then does the vision come to me Of maidens three. When apple blossom falls away, And lilies feel the first decay, Then shall the vision finished be Of maidens three. To Shadow. If ever thou didst creep From out the world of sleep, When the sun slips and the moon dips, If ever thou wast born; Or upon the starving lips Of the gray uncoloured morn. If ever thou didst fly In the darkness of the sky, When it was shaded and cloud-invaded, And thou didst form and flit By the wild wind aided, Like a phantom shed from it. If ever thou didst fall Less and less upon the wall, When the noon heat gathered and beat; And if thou didst grow amain To thy former size complete, As the hours increased again. If ever thou didst hover Large and larger, till thy cover Hid all things hence from the world's sense, So that we said no more (In thy total prevalence) Art thou here as before. If ever thou wast broken By the moon which gave her token, When she broke thee, that she woke thee, And restored thee to our sight By the many rays which stroke thee Of her interfluent light. If ever thou didst pass Into blue along the grass, And into blue the long wood through, When the sunset lay within 't, And thou hast touched anew Into softness every tint. If ever thou didst fling Omens from the bird's grey wing, (As certain these as Oscines,) If there be a lover dying, And he sigh upon his knees, Bring him comfort in his sighing. If ever thou didst scance In a wayward wistful dance Up and down like a frown, On the wall with giant scrawl, Till the soul would sink and drown In the waste and glimmering wall: If ever thou didst stand In a staircase stark and grand, And on that spot in ghastly knot Didst seem to stir and squeak; Affright that lover not, If he with death be weak. For if his love should weep In some violet-lidded sleep, The tears arise in her sweet eyes Like a golden shadow-fit; And her blush it flits and flies As the shadows fly and flit. And what is likest thee? What makes thee dear to me? The blush and tremble which fain dissemble How much of mine is hers; The very blush and tremble Which her sweet pride demurs. Ode to Joy. Too long hast thou been lost; the cup has left My pallid lips; too bitter overlong The draught had grown; a hideous poison eft Swam upwards towards the quaffing mouth, a wrong Was done by nature's nectar to my youth; So with us all; a pallid spectral troop, Whose thoughts are grey ere age be come in sooth, We sit together, and together stoop, Hiding with hands our faces, when the cloud Of memory from the deep with thunderous rain Swells up against us; then, ah, then we shroud Our faces from the iron-driving pain, In horror bowed. A ghostly company, be sure, are we; At thought of joy our eyes are full of tears; We cannot walk with lovers on the lea, We dare not have sweet music in our ears: We toiled through spring for summer's golden sheaf, And for our harvest found we hemlock strewn; Ah, why, when we were cursed beyond belief, For other hearts should Fortune keep her boon? Not so, believe us, sorrow is the lot Of all who look for joy beneath the moon; Come, pace the shore that leads thee to our grot, While o'er blue waters dies the bygone tune, Rejoicing not. Behold the white clouds roll along the blue, And like the clouds do flocks o'erspread the plain; And like them winds the forest out of view; Shall not Joy's chariot come with splendid train, And he descend and walk the living air, With Melody and Peace, and Happy Love, Wing-footed, rosy-limbed, with myrtle rare And olive crowned from old Eleusis' grove? Ah, no, the fury night will soon be here; She comes with storms that drive the flocks away, And takes the large free clouds to make her bier, And rends the leaves; no longer youth can stay Nor joy appear. The Vision of Thebes. True poesy is thought impassionëd, Moulded of form, sound, colour; and so wed To outer life: she is the pure ideal Transferred to use, refiner of the real: She sleeps unstirred till won from intellect By passion, the great mover, and so deck'd In many coloured life: nor loses she Aught of her secret grace and purity By such strong contact with this outwardness, Else were she formless, voiceless, imageless, A slumbrous phantom, brighter, subtiler Than sunshine upon wide-spun gossamer, But void and mute, an unfulfilled decree, An aimless power, a realmless deity. Yet now she lives insphered within the world, Haunting all time with music, and empearled In all the preciousness of outer life, The child of beauty, sprung from gentle strife Of influences diverse, yet supreme, Whereby the soul is joined with heaven's scheme. Therefore the past is glorious; and each place Wherein the past has been, wherein the race Of man hath moved is holy; 'tis the lair Of passions yet unspent; therein they swear That oft the wind hath utterance not its own, Pregnant with airy meaning; there have flown Shapes half-seen by their shadows, which but glance, Then mock the sudden eye; there oft the dance Of phantasy is pressed upon the dew; There whispery fens have music, often too From barren, ruined, wasteful solitudes Great sounds have sprung, swollen on the swell of woods, And mingled with night gushings of far streams, Floated and died; these were the first stray gleams Of the great dawn of legend, and in sooth It might be so, for legend oft spheres truth, And the great cycle ever hath onrolled, Changeful of form, but certain to unfold Weird broideries of time; like as the years Glide in quaternion, still the harbingers Of life and beauty, though in each the dower Differs in depth of season, sun, or shower. Thus then her chiefest glory earth has won From man's reflected presence, as the sun Flushes with purple heaven's wide westering side, And that again the sea: I oft have tried In sorry sort to image to my sense Fair cities, and the bygone opulence Of ruined wastes; and, certes, howsoe'er Legends be true, yet oft to poet there, Where most the shadows of time's wings have gloomed, Have come sweet dreams, which almost have assumed Bodily shapes, the concourse of swift thought, Which but for very transience would be nought. Such me befel, a vision of past gladness, Filled with the rayless imagery of sadness, Big with the glories, darkened with the woe Of nations dead, and ages long ago. And I must try a strange and antique theme, The dim remembrance of a flitted dream; And I must venture on far wanderings, Dimming my soul in underlights of things. I had a vision, and the past came to me; She touched me with her voice—her voice ran through me: She was a shadow, that strange phantasy, A trembler upon being, moving wearily; Her voice an echo, shadow's utterance, A shadow and an echo! then a trance Fell on my senses, but my spirit sped, A mystic pinion, wheresoe'er she led. Then came I to an awful place, afar, Upon the midmost tide of night, and there I saw a stony whiteness answering Unto the moon's uncertain glimmering: There were dim forms of tower and pyramid Narrowing skywards, but all else was hid, By the false breadths of the uncertain light: Midway a river rolled through the deep night, Black, weltering sullenly; and lo, thereon, Cinctured with imaged beams the image of the moon. Then entered I the place with secret dread, Passing through streets of ruin, where my tread Fell drearily, for it was very lone, And full of wasteful haunts, and far agone In desolation: columns stood there shorn Of half their height, and massy fragments torn From fallen piles, and crumbling, fissured walls, And sunken towers and domes, and capitals Broken on bases: there too images Of nameless shapes, supporting cornices, Stood in half-lights: and to the chill night air A few scant trees sighed sadly: everywhere Shadows fell black on shadows, but all round The outermost, unbroken, reached the ground. Much marvelling at this so grievous change Upon such grandeur wrought, and giving range To many fancies, till the stars were sped Far into morn, in that untenanted And voiceless place throughout the night I stood, But when the dawn betrayed the secret quietude, Then saw I clearly all the mystery Of obelisk and tower, all emblemry Of cornice-couchant sphinx with calm wide eyes, All wonders of dim-reaching galleries, Of crumbling frieze, of ruining gradine, Of marbled slab, of moulding palatine; Moreover when the clearness of daylight Slid into distant haze, there seemed upright, Fronting the east, a giant mass of stone, Shaped into man's rough semblance, whereupon Unto my brain swift recognition ran: Memnon I knew, and Thebes Egyptian. Ay, 'twas the glorious city, hundred-gated, The olden one, before which stand abated All puny elegance of modern days, Whose cumbrous grandeur even to our gaze Fills out all myths of founder demigod; The stony ghost of old, the sea-bank broad, Staying time's waves, which, with its great compeers, Stands forth unwhelmed by the huge tide of years; Gazing whereon we may uptrace the springs Of human action through the past of things, And scoop the future from the past—such thought Rose in my heart, with fear and wonder fraught, Unshaped in word, till from my breast unpent My voice at length throughout the ruins went. All without grief, 'twas thus I cried aloud, Is light and flitting as a rainless cloud; And thou, fair city, hast a name, and fate Dewing all time with tears, for thou dost mate Thyself unto an inner region Of glory and decay. Ah, once the throne Whereon erewhile towered brave humanity Enseated grandly, dost thou prostrate lie? Alas, not ruined shade of portico Nor fall of turret strength hath brought thee low To this immortal mourning; thou dost show The truth outrolled by rolling centuries Of glorious but changing destinies. The heart of man is one! throughout all life At grasp with circumstance, at endless strife To clothe itself in deed; but as no brain Hath e'er been found capacious to contain An ultimate ideal, accident Entails itself on all that we invent, Nor aught is perfect, nothing can attain Its final point at once, but still must gain By slow accessions, still must be increased By added strength; hence nought hath ever ceased, All life is reproduction; hence upspring Cities, with all their wealthy minist'ring To diverse wants, which ever couchant lie In different natures; hence society Is holden in the bond of difference And hence compacted; hence, great Thebës, hence, The impulse that created thee still moves Unslumbrous and unspent, for what man loves Is ever changeless, and becomes the centre Whence he draws wider circles; do thou enter Among those wondrous antitypes of soul Which show it like yet diverse, be the goal At once, and starting-point of human thought! Ah! subtle cause thine overthrow hath wrought, Who whilom sat'st the crown of circumstance, Taking joy's tithe from every moment, glance Upon thyself, and say, are not the powers Of ruin sown within? Thy sister towers Stand on in their first strength, by battle's wrack Unbroken, by time's ever ruthless track Scarce furrowed; what then was it that hath cast Earth's darkness on thee, making thee at last A sepulchre for ruin? Sad, that e'er Man's glory should be made his sepulchre! Yea, that one idea driven to excess Should be its own destroyer! Thou didst press Thy law of sole dominion questionless Unto its furthest; thou didst give no scope To individual purpose, interest, hope, Those parents of endeavour; and the want Of this one truth it was did disenchant Thy solemn halls; thy stern unswerving code On alien ages sunk its unmeet load, Nor knew to fit itself to after years. So to its rules old tyranny adheres, The season being gone, in fell despite Of change and progress, and forgetting quite That man's advancing work can never die, And all must share the immortality. Thus mused I till the richness of the west, Of hues immingled in a floating rest, Showed like a melted rainbow, till adown Fluttering in thousand stars great night had flown. I mused; I saw the budding moon enshrined By gentlest office of the summer wind, With clouds to couch on; and in that still hour Great visions stood enshapèd by the power That works in earnest meditation: lo! Methought the place so gloom-entranced ere now Had met the noonlight, and a dream in dream Fell on my soul, for all the air did seem Enthronged with uplift shapes of tower and fane, Each bearing strange device upon its van Of hieroglyph; and 'neath them life again Was multiplied in dusky throngs of men, And from collision groups of circumstance Sprang ever chequered; 'twas as though advance Of onward-flowing time had never been Since first that desert was joy's chosen scene. For ruin was not: the great city's smoke Swung heavy in the sky, and voices spoke In the wide-whispering night, borne from beneath To the upper air, far wafted on the breath Of grief or laughter: midst a mighty throng I entered, borne resistlessly along By the great human concourse, through long streets Walled by vast columns and enset with sheets Of pale red marble; ever as I went The wonder grew, for all the crowd upsent Red pointed flames of torchlight to the sky, As on they marched beneath emblazonry Hung high from palace roof or pillar tall, As suited ancient Thebes upon a festival. There were vast forms of calm eternal lines, That brooded ever upon guarded shrines; There were slight nameless creatures with scythed wings, Embodied thoughts and delicatest things In fretwork, whereon ever flitted past Warm hurried glows and moving shadows cast From torches, and made thinner by the moon; Unto a temple huge the crowd rolled on, And passed between its valves of crudded gold, Into a four-square court wide to enfold The vastest throng that e'er to worship passed, Round which went curtains always interlaced, From shaft to shaft wide floating; and entraced With tender curves of richest broidery, That showed upon the clear and moony sky. O'erhead the fane loomed hugely, and in front Two doors of inwrought glory nigh a font O'erdrooped by heavy-leavèd orient trees, Drew all eyes towards them; for the mysteries Of Egypt's greatest god were shrinèd there. Now when the joyous torches sunken were, And the glad shoutings hushed for reverence, And one sole voice was telling how immense The glory and the terror and the wrath, And prayer was breathing thoughts unuttered forth, Back I withdrew me from the golden glare, Back from the awèd throng, apart to where Was only moonlight in a quiet street. And there the far-off echoes did I meet Of the full-throated response, and stray gleams Of magic lights, and heard the voice of streams. The broad-breast river ran through floating shades, Lapping sheer blocks of granite, colonnades That high upheld long rows of palaces; And on its eddies glanced light pinnaces With lamps and wafts of music: on I hied, Methought in silence, lone and unespied, Beneath vast groves of sleeping foliage, The stars among their branches; soft umbrage Moon-flung on sheeny fountains, where there lay Enwalled spaces widened to embay Quaint plots of greeness: then with sudden change Methought I was amid an endless range Of palace fronts, tall shafts, and long arcades, And slabbed steps that led through balustrades Of columns twin on either hand, which spread Into an archèd roof high overhead Through all the aislèd length; each floor was paven With level squares of marble, gem-engraven, Which chilled the moonbeams streaming over them; And on the doors was wealth of gold and gem, A solemn wealth, which gave to the moonlight Rich molten gleams; and fountain rillets bright, Jetted from marble stems by water elves, Came spreaded over smooth and level shelves, Wave rippling over wave; and thence they fell With ceaseless murmur and a gentle swell Unto the marble limits of their lake. Thus momently did I myself betake Through golden vestibules and galleries Into wide palace courts and breadth of terraces: Till in the midst of this wide loveliness Close sandalled forms about me 'gan to press, And I was in amongst the throng again: And that great heart, whence through the whole domain Of Egypt, life was pulsed, throbbed mightily, In its primeval strength before mine eye. But now these visions warm began to pale, Gradual as fogbank parting from a vale; The night was sinking, and the stars were dim, And soon the morning light began to swim Slow through the eastern port with saddening gleam; A hundred fountains twisted the first beam In crystal writhings, then all straight were gone, And all the show, and I was left alone. Babylon and Nineveh. From desert land the Arab sheikh is come across the southern sea; And now his camel skirts the wastes that lead him through the old Chaldee; He watches not the gannet flying over towards the setting sun, But marks the bittern and its shadow on the pools of Babylon. 'Twas written in the Burden her destruction should as sudden be As Sodom and Gomorrah sunk beneath the waters of the sea; And still they say that often he who sails upon those languid waves, At ebb sees whitely gleaming palaces and spires in ocean caves, As underneath the ocean are preserved the Cities of the Plain, So by the fire preserved to us, the towers of Bel and Nin remain; No earthquake could have kept them as the fire that wrought their overthrow; And every age has deeper sealed that mortal sleep so soft and low. And rivers that run swiftly thither from the mountains of their birth, Go ever from them slowly, big with slime, and dust, and fire-baked earth: Then all their ancient limits on their heedless way they overpass, Until at last the plain is swamped beneath the festering morass. Ah! once their cry was in their ships; the old Phœnician galleys went From thence; and Tyre and Sidon were Chaldea's mighty monument: Ponders the lonely sheikh, as o'er the waste the swinging camel speeds; The Kufa far behind him with its steersman dark and gaunt recedes. Then here is Babylon: behold the fiery cloud of the simoon Hangs o'er its shapeless mounds in vaporous setting of the afternoon; So o'er a lonely gravestone might a widow's dusky garments sweep, As that wild wanderer surveys it from Borsippa's crumbled steep. Beneath those quiet heaps how many dead are sleeping; there they lie, The old Chaldean glory, all the pomp and all the imag'ry; The temples and the palaces, the hanging gardens and the walls, The friezes upon pavements strewn, the bases upon capitals. Still rises here the Kasr, Nebúchadnezzar reared in days fifteen, And fronting it in solemn state the huger Babil mound is seen; And once upon that very place where now he stands upon the Tel, Stood bearded kings and sages, and the votive offerings smoked to Bel. To the seven planets rose that temple with its chord of colours bright; To form the planetary spheres the sacred band of hues unite; Black, orange, red, gold, yellow, blue, the silver symbol of the moon, And so sprang the storeys in a mystic harmony of tune. From mound to mound the grass is spread, by ruin raised in swathes of green; It leads the eye from height to height o'er all the mute and desert scene; And here are recent traces where some roving Arab camp was laid: It was the caravan that here one little stage its journey stayed. Do not these vestiges of man unseal the giant grave beneath? The latest trace of human life interpret best the ancient death? More ghastly are the cinders of the latest fire that here was lit, Than mound of ruin sleeping calmly with the smouldering cloud on it. And 'twixt this generation and the last a distance intervenes, More vast than lies between the many centuries the ruin screens: Than lies between the king the Persian army slew, and Naram-sin,— The king who ruled primevally before the sceptre passed to Nin. In ruin all confounded lie; and Erech is their tranquil tomb; Lo! far on the horizon looms the Babylonian catacomb; There coffins, piled in mountains, of their ancient sleep are dispossessed By hordes of shuddering Moslems and the busy searchers of the West. They yield them from their cedar shelves and crumble from their stony bier; They sink upon the alien decks; on river drifts they disappear; And gain far off a foreign home, by stranger eyes and hands defiled; From this depopulated land the very dead shall be exiled. To north, behold, another river pours its life-blood to the sea; Behold another city-circle girding ancient Nineveh; Most ancient Asshur, holy Calah, Arbil, Khazah, Khorsabad; Half were capitals, ere Nineveh herself the chief dominion had. And now they lie around her, now the sorrow of the earth on all; Strange silence that hath long endured, and coldness in the charnel hall; What man dare sit within it, as the tunnelled light is stealing round On sculptured slabs of pallid stone, that form the walls, and strew the ground? The fire-bleached gypsum shines again, the awful bearded kings are viewed Amid the courts where once they wrote their deeds in living attitude; 'Tis they who taught the sword to range in ways before unknown to man From Zagros to the Western Sea, from Egypt to the Caspian. On swords this first of empires rose, and not as bringing peace by war They ruled o'er prostrate nations, but as warrior o'er warrior; Each king his standard drew along the scene of his forefathers' toils, As rends the griffin o'er and o'er the dragon's still rebelling coils. Each king in god-like battle joy upon his warring chariot stands, Scourging the prostrate foe with rain of bitter arrows from his hands; They scale the walls of mighty forts, the rivers deep and wide they ford; They cut their way through pathless woods, they build their city with the sword. The eagle rides upon their rein; the winged circle with them speeds, That living wheel prophetic, prescient, nimbus of eternal deeds; And here behold the votive bulls, in mystic legend gravely wrought, Ox-limbed for strength, gier-winged for speed, and fronted like a man for thought. Ah! now they fade at once, in sudden waning of the Eastern light, By grave and mound their multitudes are swallowed up in kindly night; And whether night of hours of ages, matters not at all to Pul; Yet that poor Arab waits for daylight in his lodging at Mosul. THE END.</field>
