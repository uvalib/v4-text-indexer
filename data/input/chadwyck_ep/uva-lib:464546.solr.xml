      <field name="fulltext">Jacke Upland. 1401. I, Jacke Upland, make my mone to very God, and to all true in Christ, that Antichrist and his disciples, by colour of holines, walking and deceiving Christs church by many false figures, where through (by Antichrist and his) many vertues been transposed to vices. But the felliest folke that ever Antichrist found, been last brought into the church, and in a woonder wise; for they been of diverse sects of Antichrist, sown of diverse countries and kindreds. And all men knowne well that they bee not obedient to bishops, ne leege men to kings; neither they tillen ne sowen, weeden ne reapen, wood, corn, ne grasse, neither nothing that man should helpe, but onely themselves, their lives to susteine. And these men han all manner power of God, as they seyn, in heaven and in yearth, to sell heaven and hell to whom that them liketh; and these wretches weet never where to been themselves. And therefore, freer, if thine order and rules been grounded on Goddis law, tell thou mee, Jacke Upland, that I aske of thee, and if thou be or thinkest to be on Christes side, keepe thy paciens. Saint Paule teacheth that all our deedes should be do in charitie, and els it is nought worth, but displeasing to God, and harme to oure soules. And for that freers challenge to be greatest clerkes of the church, and next following Christ in living, men should for charitie ask them some questions, and pray them to ground their answeres in reason and holy writ; for else their answer would nought be woorth, be it flourished never so faire, and, as me thinke, men might skilfully aske thus of a freer. 1. Freer, how many orders bee in earth? and which is the perfectest order? of what order art thou ? who made thine order? what is thy rule? is there any perfecter rule than Christ himself made? If Christs rule be most perfect, why rulest thou thee not thereafter? Without more, why shal a freer be more punished, if he break the rule that his patron made, than if he break the hests that God himself made. 2. Approveth Christ any more religions than one that saint James speaketh of? If hee approveth no more, why hast thou left his rule, and takest another? Why is a freer apostata, that leveth his order, and taketh another sect, sith there is but one religion of Christ? 3. Why be ye wedded faster to your habits than a man is to his wife? For a man may leave his wife for a year or two, as many men done; and if you leave your habite a quarter of a yeare, ye should be holden apostataes. 4. Maketh your habit you men of religion or no? If it doe, then ever as it weareth, your religion weareth; and after your habit is better, your religion is better; and when yee have liggen it beside, then lig ye your religion beside you, and been apostataes. Why buy ye you so precious clothes, sith no man seeketh such, but for vaine glorie, as saint Gregorie sayth? What betokeneth your great hood, your scaplerie, your knotted girdle, and your wide cope? 5. Why use ye all one colour more than other christian men doe? What betokeneth that ye been clothed all in one manner clothing? If yee say it betokeneth love and charitie, certes then ye be oft hypocrites, when any of you hateth another, and in that that ye wol be said holy by your clothing. Why may not a freer weare clothing of another sect of freers, sith holinesse stondeth not in the cloths? 6. Why hold ye silence in one house more than another, sith men ought over all to speake the good and leave the evill? Why eat you flesh in one house more than in another, if your rule and your order be perfect, and the patron that made it? 7. Why get ye your dispensations to have it more easie? Certes either it seemeth that yee be unperfect, or he that made it so hard, that ye may not hold it. And siker, if ye hold not the rule of your patrons, ye be not then her freers, and so ye lie upon your selves. 8. Why make you as dede men, when yee be professed, and yet ye be not dede, but more quicke beggars than you were before? And it seemeth evil a dede man to go about and beg. 9. Why will ye not suffer your novises hear your councels in your chapter house, ere that they have ben professed, if your councels been true and after Gods law? 10. Why make yee so costly houses to dwell in, sith Christ did not so, and dede men should have but graves, as falleth it to dede men? And yet ye have more courts than many lords of England; for ye now wenden throgh the realme, and ech night will lig in your own courts, and so mow but right few lords doe. 11. Why heire you to ferme your limitors, giving therefore each yeare a certain rent, and will not suffer one in anothers limitation, right as yee were your selves lords of countries? Why be ye not under your bishops visitations, and leege men to our king? Why aske ye no letters of bretherheads of other mens praiers, as ye desire that other men should aske letters of you? If your letters be good, why grant ye them not generally to all maner of men, for the more charitie? 12. Mowe ye make any man more perfect brether for your prayers, than God hath by our beleeve, by our baptisme and his owne grant? If ye mow, certes, then ye be above God. Why make ye men beleeve that your golden trentall sung of you, to take therefore ten shillings, or at least five shillings will bring soules out of hell, or out of purgatorie? If this be sooth, certes, yee might bring all soules out of paine; and that wol ye nought, and then ye be out of charitie. 13. Why make ye men beleeve that he that is buried in your habit shal never come in hel, and ye weet not of your selfe whether yee shall to hell or no? And if this were sooth, ye should sell your high houses to make many habites for to save many mens soules. 14. Why steal ye mens children for to make hem of your sect, sith that theft is against Gods hests, and sith your sect is not perfect? Yee know not whether the rule that yee bind him to be best for him or worst. 15. Why underneme yee not your brethren for their trespasse after the law of the gospell, sith that underneming is the best that may be? But ye put them in prison oft, when they do after Gods law; and by saint Augustines rule, if any doe amisse, and would not amend him, ye should put him from you. 16. Why coveit ye shrift and burying of other mens parishens, and none other sacrament that falleth to christian folke? Why busie ye not to heare to shrift of poore folke, as well as of rich, lordes and ladies, sith they mow have more plentie of shrift-fathers than poore folke mow? Why say ye not the gospel in houses of bedred men, as ye do in rich mens, that mowe goe to church and heare the gospell? Why covet you not to burie poor folk among you, sith that they been most holy, as ye saine that ye ben for your povertie ? 17. Why will ye not be at her diriges, as ye have ben at rich mens, sith God praiseth him more than he doth other men? What is thy prayer worth, sith thou wilt take therefore? For all chapmen yee need to bee most wise for dread of simonie. What cause hast thou that thou wilt not preach the gospel, as God saith that thou sholdst, sith it is the best lore. and also our beleeve? Why be ye evill apaid that secular priestes should preach the gospell, sith God himselfe hath bodden hem? 18. Why hate ye the gospell to be preached, sith ye be so much hold therto? For ye win more by yeare with In principio, than with all the rules that ever your patrones made. And in this minstrels ben better than ye; for they contrarien not to the mirths that they maken, but yee contrarien the gospell, both in word and deed. 19. Freer, when thou receivest a penie for to say a masse, whether sellest thou Gods bodie for that penie, or thy praier, or els thy travell? If thou saiest thou wolt not travell for to say the masse but for the penie, that certes if this be sooth, then thou lovest too litle meed for thy soule; and if thou sellest Gods bodie, other thy prayer, then it is very simonie, and art become a chapman worse than Judas, that sold it for thirtie pence. 20. Why writest thou hir names in thy tables that yeveth thee mony, sith God knoweth al thing? For it semeth by thy writing that God would not reward him, but thou writest in thy tables, God would els forgotten it. Why bearest thou God in hand, and slanderest him, that he begged for his meat, sith he was lord over all? For then had he beene unwise, to have begged and have no need thereto. Freer, after what lawe rulest thou thee? Where findest thou in Gods lawe that thou shouldest thus beg? 21. What manner men needeth for to beg? For whom oweth such men to beg? Why beggest thou so for thy bretheren? If thou saiest, for they have need, then thou doest it for the more perfection, or els for the least, or els for the meane. If it be the most perfection of all, then should all thy brethren do so, and then no man needed to beg but for him self, for so should no man beg but he needed. And if it be the least perfection, why lovest thou then other men more than thyselfe? For so thou art not well in charitie, since thou shouldest seek the more perfection, after thy power living thy self most after God; and thus leaving that imperfection, thou shouldest not so beg for them. And if it is a good mean, thus to beg as thou doest, then should no man do so, but they been in this good meane; and yet such a mean granted to you may never be grounded on Gods law, for then both lerid and leaud that ben in meane degree of this world, should go about and beg as ye do. And if all should do so, certes well nigh all the world should go about and beg as ye done, and so should there be ten beggers against one yever. Why procurest thou men to yeve the their almes, and saiest it is so needful, and thou wilt not thy selfe win thee that meed. 22. Why wilt thou not beg for poore bedred men that bin poorer than any of your sect, that liggen and mow not go about to help him selfes ? Sith we be all brethren in God, and that bretherhed passeth any other that ye or any man could make. And where most need were, there were most perfection; either els yee hold them not your pure brethren, but worse, but then ye be unperfect in your begging. Why make ye so many maisters among you, sith it is against the teaching of Christ and his apostles? 23. Whose ben all your rich courts that yee han, and all your rich jewels, sith ye seyen that ye han nought ne in proper ne in common? If ye saine they ben the popes, why gather yee then of poore men and lords so much out of the kings hand to make your pope rich, And sith ye sain that it is great perfection to have nought in proper ne in common, why bee ye so fast about to make the pope, that is your father, rich, and put on him imperfection? Sithen ye saine that your goods been all his, and he should by reason be the most perfect man, it seemeth openlich that ye been cursed children so to slander your father and make him imperfect. And if yee saine that the goods be yours, then do ye ayenst your rule. And if it be not ayenst your rule, then might ye have both plough and cart, and labour as other good men done, and not so to beg by losengery, and idle, as ye done. If yee say that it is more perfection to beg, than to travell or to worch with your hand, why preach ye not openly, and teach all men to do so, sith it is the best and most perfect life to the help of their soules, as ye make children to beg, that might have bin rich heirs? Why make ye not your feasts to poore men, and yeveth him yefts, as yee done to the rich, sith poore men han more need than the rich? What betokeneth that ye goe tweine and tweine togither? If ye be out of charitie, ye accord not in soule. Why beg ye and take salaries therto more than other priests, sith hee that most taketh, most charge hath? 24. Why hold ye not saint Francis rule and his testament, sith Francis saith that God shewed him this living and this rule? and certes, if it were Gods will, the pope might not fordo it, or els Francis was a lier, that saied in this wise. And but this testament that he made accord with Gods will, or els erred, he is a lier, that were out of charitie; and as the law saith, he is accursed that letteth the rightful last wil of a dead man. And this testament is the last will of Francis that is a dead man; it seemeth therefore that all his freers been cursed. 25. Why will ye not touch no coined money with the crosse ne with the kings head, as ye done other jewels both of gold and silver? Certes if ye despise the crosse, or the kings head, then ye be worthy to be despised of God and the King; and sith ye will receive money in your hearts, and not with your hands, it seemeth that ye hold more holinesse in your hands than in your hearts, and then be false to God. 26. Why have ye exempt you from our kings lawes, and visiting of our bishops, more than other christen men that liven in this realme, if ye be not guiltie of traitorie to our realme, or trespassers to your bishops? But ye will have the kings lawes for the trespasse doe to you, and ye wil have power of other bishops more than other priests, and also have leave to prison your brethren, as lords in your courts, more than other folks han that ben the kings leege men. 27. Why shal some sect of you freers pay ech a yere a certaine to her generall provinciall or minister, or els to her sovereines, but if he steal a certaine number of children, as some men saine? And certes, if this ben sooth, then yee bee constreined upon certein pain to do theft, against Gods commaundement, Non furtum facies. 28. Why be ye so hardie to grant by letters of fraternitie to men and women, that they shall have part and merite of all your good deedes? And ye weten never whether God bee apayed with your deeds, because of your sinne. Also yee witten never whether that man or woman be in state to bee saved or damned, then shall he have no merit in heaven for his owne deeds ne for none other mans. And all were it so that he should have part of your good deeds, yet should hee have no more that God would give him after that he were worthie; and so much shall each man have of God's yeft, without your limitation. But if ye will say that ye been Gods fellowes, and that he may nought doe without your assent, then ye be blasphemers to God. 29. What betokeneth that yee have ordeined, that when such one as ye have made your brother or sister, and hath a letter of your seale, that letter nought bee brought in your holye chapter, and there be rad, or els yee will not pray for him. And but ye willen pray especially for all other that were not made your brethren or sistren, then were ye not in right charitie, for that ought to be common, and semely in ghostly things. 30. Freer, what charitie is this, to overcharge the people by mightie begging, under colour of preaching, or praying, or masses singing? Sith holy write biddeth not thus, but even the contrarie; for all such ghostly deedes should be done frely, as God yeveth them freely. 31. Freer, what charitie is this, to beguile children or they commen to discretion, and bind hem to your orders, that ben not grounded in Gods law, agains hir friends will? Sithen by this follie been many apostataes, both in will and deed, and many beene apostataes in hir will during all her life, that would gladly be discharged, if they wist how; and so many ben apostataes, that shoulden in other states have been true men. 32. Freer, what charitie is this, to make so many freers in every country, to the charge of the people? Sith persons and vicars alone, ye, secular priests alone, ye, monkes and cannons alone, with bishops above them, were ynough to the church to doe the priests office. And to adde more than ynough, is a foule errour, and great charge to the people, and this openly against Gods will, that ordained all thyngs to be done in weight, number, and measure. And Christ himselfe was apaied with twelve apostles and a fewe disciples, to preach and doe priests office to all the whole world; then was it better doe than is nowe at this time, by a thousand dele. And right so as foure fingers with a thombe in a mans hand helpeth a man to worch, and double number of fingers in one hand should let him more; and so the more number that there were passing the measure of Gods ordinaunce, the more were a man letted to worch; right so, as it seemeth, it is of these new orders that ben added to the church, without ground of holy write and Gods ordinance. 33. Freer, what charity is this, to the people to lie, and say that ye follow Christ in povertie more than other men done? And yet in curious and costly housing, and fine and precious clothing, and delicious and liking feeding, and in treasure and jewels, and rich ornaments, freers passen lords and other rich worldly men, and soonest they should bring her cause about, be it never so costly, though Gods law be put abacke. 34. Freer, what charitie is this, to gather up the books of holy write, and put hem in tresorie, and so emprison them from secular priestes and curats, and by this cautell let hem to preach the gospell freely to the people without worldly meed, and also to defame good priests of heresie, and lien on hem openly, for to let hem to show Gods law by the holy gospell to the Christian people. 35. Freer, what charitie is this, to faine so much holines in your bodily clothing, that ye clepe your habit, that many blind fools desiren to die therein more than in another? And also that a freer that leveth his habit, late founden of men, may not be assoiled till he take it againe, but is apostata, as ye saine, and cursed of God and man both? The freer beleeveth truth and patience, chastitie, meeknesse, and sobrietie, yet for the more part of his life he may soon be assoiled of his prior; and if he bring home to his house much good by the yeare, bee it never so falsely begged and pilled of the poore and needie people in countries about, he shall be hold a noble freer; o Lord, whether this be charitie! 36. Freer, what charity is this, to prease upon a rich man, and to intice him to be buried among you form his parish church, and to such rich men give letters of fraternitie, confirmed by your generall seale, and therby to bear him in hand, that he shal have part of all your masses, mattens, preachings, fastings, wakings, and all other good deeds done by your brethren of your order, both whilest he liveth, and after that he is dead; and yet ye witten never whether your deeds be acceptable to God, ne whether that man that hath that letter be able by good living to receive any part of your deeds. And yet a poore man, that ye wite well or supposen in certen to have no good of, ye ne given to such letters, though he be a better man to God than such a rich man. Neverthelesse this poore man doth not retch therof; for as men supposen, such letters, and many other that freers behoten to men, be full false deceits of freers, out of all reason, and Gods law, and Christian mens faith. 37. Freer, what charitie is this, to be confessors of lords and ladies, and to other mightie men, and not amend hem in hir living? but rather, as it seemeth, to be the bolder to pill hir poore tenants, and to live in lechery; and there to dwell in your office of confessor for winning of worldlie goods, and to be hold great by colour of such ghostly offices? This seemeth rather pride of freers, than charitie of God. 38. Freer, what charitie is this, to fain that who so liveth after your order, liveth most perfectlie and next followeth the state of apostles in povertie and penance; and yet the wisest and greatest clerkes of you wend and send or procure to the court of Rome, to be made cardinals or bishops of the popes chaplens, and to be assoiled of the vow of povertie and obedience to your ministers; in the which, as ye sain, standeth most perfection and merit of your orders; and thus ye faren as Pharisees that sain one and do another to the contrarie, Why name ye more the patron of your order in your Confiteor, when ye begin masse, than other saints, apostles, or martyrs, that holy church hold[eth] more glorious than hem, and clepe hem your patrons and your avowries? Freer, whether was saint Francis in making of his rule that he set thine order in, a foole and a liar, or else wise and true? If ye sain that he was not a foole, but wise, ne a liar, but true, why shew ye contrarie by your doing, when by your suggestion to the pope ye said that your rule that Francis made was so hard, that ye mow not live to hold it, without declaration and dispensation of the pope? And so by your deed, ne let your patron a foole, that made a rule so hard that no man may well keepe; and eke your deed prooveth him a liar, where he saith in his rule, that he tooke and learned it of the Holy Ghost; for how might ye for shame pray the pope undo that the Holy Ghost bit, as when ye prayed him to dispense with the hardnesse of your order? Freer, which of the foure orders of friers is best, to a man that knoweth not which is the best, but would faine enter into the best, and none other? If thou saiest that thine is the best, then saiest thou that none of the other is as good as thine; and in this ech freer in the three other orders wooll say that thou liest, for in the self same maner ech other freer wooll say that his order is best. And thus to ech of the foure orders bin the other three contrary in this point, in the which if any say sooth, that is one alone, for there may be but one be the best of foure. So followeth it that if ech of these orders answered to this question as thou doest, three were false, and but one true, and yet no man should wite who that were. And thus it seemeth that the most part of freers bin or should be liars in this point, and they should answere thereto. If you say that another order of the freers is better than thine, or as good, why tooke ye not rather thereto as to the better, when thou mightst have chose at the begining / And eke why shouldst thou be an apostata, to leave thine order and take thee to that is better, and so why goest thou not from thine order into that? Freer, is there any perfecter rule of religion than Christ Gods sonne gave in his gospell to his brethren? or than that religion that saint James in his epistle maketh mention of? If you say yes, then puttest thou on Christ, that is the wisedom of God the Father, unkunning, unpower, and evill will: for then he could not make his rule so good as an other did his, and so he had be unkunning; that he might not so make his rule so good as another man might, and so were he unmightie, and not God; as he would not make his rule so perfect as another did his, and so he had bin evill willed, namely to himselfe. For if he might and could, and would have made a rule perfect, without default, and did not, he was not Gods Sonne almighty. For if any other rule be perfecter than Christes, then must Christes rule lacke of that perfection, by as much as the other weren more perfecter; and so were default, and Christ had failed in making of his rule; but to put any default or failing in God is blasphemie. If thou say that Christes rule, and that religion which saint James maketh mention of, is perfectest, why holdest thou not thilke rule without more? And why clepest thou the rather of saint Francis or saint Dominiks rule, or religion or order, than of Christes rule or Christes order? Freer, canst thou any default assigne in Christes rule of the gospell, with the which he taught all men sikerly to be saved, if they kept it to her ending? If thou say it was too hard, then saiest thou Christ lied; for he said of his rule, âMy yoke is soft and my burden light.â If thou say Christes rule was too light; that may be assigned for no default, for the better it may be kept. If thou saist that there is no default in Christes rule of the gospell, sith Christ himself saith it is light and easie, what need was it to patrons of freers to adde more thereto, and so to make an harder religion to save freers than was the religion of Christes apostles, and his disciples helden, and were saved by? But if they woulden that her freers saten above the apostles. in heaven for the harder religion that they keepen here, so would they sitten in heaven above Christ himselfe, for their more and streict observations, then so should they be better than Christ himslef, with mischance. Go now foorth, and fraine your clerks, and ground ye you in Gods law, and gif Jacke an answer; and when ye han assoiled me that I have said sadly, in truth I shall soile thee of thine orders, and save thee to heaven. If freers kun not, or mow not, excuse hem of these questions asked of hem, it seemeth that they be horrible giltie against God and her even christian; for which gilts and defaults it were worthy that the order, that they cal their order, were fordone. And it is woonder that men susteine hem, or suffer hir live in such maner. For holie write biddeth that thou do well to the meeke, and give not to the wicked, but forbed to give hem bread, least they be made thereby mightier through you. The Reply of Friar Daw Topias, with Jack Upland's Rejoinder.Square brackets denote editorial insertions or emendations 1401. An answere to this tretis, that a frere hath forgid; he callith hym self Daw Topias, ares[oneth] Jak Uplonde. He groundith hym upon seven thynges, as his ordre askith, lesynges with losengery, cursynges and false glose, chidyng with blasfemie or chyteryng as chow?es. Thow saist thi name is Dawe, it may rith wel be so; ffor thou hast condiciounes of a [tame] chow?e. He chiterith and he bribith alle that he may gete; this he doth in dede asseye of hem that knowith. Jak Dawe, thou blaberist blasfemies, and reson hast thou non; thou leggist oft Goddis lawe, bot to a false entente; ?ee, falselier than the fende, whan he saide to Crist, Quia angelis suis mandavit de te. Daw, thou fablest of foxes, and appliest hem to a puple, of whom nether thou knowyst kunnyng, ne her conversacion. Bot iche man that witte hath, and happe of discrecion, may knowe thee and thin ordre, as Crist saith, bi the werkes. Take propirtÃ© of twey foxes, and werkes of twye freres, and than thou fyndest hem meche acorde, bot freres ben the werse; if thou saist this is not so, bot groundid without skil, loke how Sampson bonde the foxes two and two togedir, til that thai destried the corne alle about hem, and this was, as a doctour saith, the figur of freres.Ho shal graunten to myn eye a strong streme of teres, to wailen and to wepyn the sorwynge of synne? for charitÃ© is chasid and flemed out of londe, and every state stakerth unstable in him silfe. Now apperid the prophecie that seint Joon seide, to joyne therto Johel in his soth sawis; the moone is al blodi and dymme on to lokyn, that signefieth lordship forslokend in synne; the sterres ben on erthe throwun and fallen to the erthe, and so is the comountÃ© treuli oppressid; the sunne is eclipsid with al his twelve pointes, by erroure and heresie, that rengnith in the chirche. Now is oure bileve laft and Lollardi growith; envie is enhaunsid and aproched to preestes, that shulden enforme her flok and ground in Goddes lawe, to love her God sovereynli, and sithen her brothir. Bot not for thanne now is tau?t hindring of states, and pursuynge of poverte, that Crist hath approved. Now is that seed of cisme sowen in the chirche; the whete fadith with the floure, oure fode is for to feche. Ffoxes frettid in fere wasten the cornes, and Cristes vine is vanishid to the verray rote. Now Achor spoilith Jerico, and lyveth of the thefte; and so lyven this Lollardis in her fals fablis. Datan and Abiron and Chorees children, with newe senceres ensencen the auters of synne. Baal preestes ben bolde sacrifice to make, and mortel maladi crepith in as a canker; and thus is Jak Uplond fodid with folie, and thour? formyng of his formere thus freyneth a frere. On wounder wise, seith Jak, freres, ?e ben growun; sowen in ?oure sectes of Anticristis hondes; unboxom to bishopis, not lege men to kynges; wede corn ne gras wil ?e not hewen, ne lyven with Jakke in labour, but al to ?our ese. Jak, thi formur is a fole, that thus thee hath yfourmed, to make so lewid an argument a?ens so many freres, that better knowen li?tles her doctours and her bible, than he can rede his troper bi a long torche. But, Jak, thou? thi questions semen to thee wyse, ?it li?tly a lewid man maye leyen hem a water; ffor summe ben lewid, summe ben shrewid summe falsli supposid; and therfore shal no maister, ne no man of scole, be vexid with thy maters, but a lewid frere that men callen frere Daw Topias, as lewid as a leke, to medelin with thi malice as longe as thou wolt. and asken not leve of kynges.That we ben not lege men, Jak, lowde thou lyest; ffor lenger than we lyven so, abide we not in londe, the sotil witt of wyse men shulde temte us wel soone, and fleme us from felowshipe, and done us of dawe. We obeien to bishopes, as boxomnesse askith, althou?? not so fer forth as seculer preestes; ffor holy chirche hath us hent and happid with grace, to were us from wederes of wynteres stormes, wede corn ne gras have we not to hewen, ne with Jakke Uplond ferme the dikes; in worde and werke.althou? Poul in his pistele laborers preise, displesith him not the preestes that syngen her masses. For ri?t as in thi bodi, Jake ben ordeyned thin hondis, ffor thin heed and for thi feet and for thin eyen to wirken, ri?t so the comoun peple God hath disposid, to laboren for holi chirche and lordshipis also. A! for-writhen serpent, thi wyles ben aspied, with a thousand wrynkels thou vexed many soules; thi malice is so michel, thou maist not for-hele, but thi venym with vehemens thou spittist al at ones. Thou seist we ben confounders of prelates and of lordes; but, Jakke, bi my lewtÃ©, lowde thou lyest; ffor telle me, bi oure counseile what lord hath ben confoundid? or what prelat of ony pepil put in ony peril? But sith that wickide worme, Wiclyf be his name, began to sowe the seed of cisme in the erthe, sorowe and shendship hath awaked wyde, in lordship and prelacie hath growe the lasse grace. Jak, thou seist with symonye the seven sacramentes we sellen, and preien for no men but ?if thei willen paien. God wote, Jakke, thou sparist here the sothe, and, er we departen us asoundre, it shal wel be shewid. But oon is the sacrament that we han to dispensen off penaunce to the peple whan nede askith. I trowe it be thi paroche preest, Jacke, that thou meenest, that nyl not hosel his parischens til the peny be paied, for ?our assent in symonye.ne assoilen hem of her synne withouten schrift silver. Jakke, of thi foli thou feynest fife erores, and ?it ben ther but foure foundid in the lawe, ffalsly as thou seist and soone shal be distroied. Jakke, thi lewid prophecie I preise not at a peese. Somme fantasie of Fiton hath marrid thi mynde; thou prophete of Baal, thi God is aslepe; the goodnesse of the grost may not li?ten upon thee. Whi presumyst thou so proudli to prophecie these thingis? and wost no more what thou blaberest than Balames asse. Thou mayntenist in thi mater that matrimony thus we marre; but this arowe shal turne a?en to him that it sent, ffor thou and thi secte, sothli ?e schenden, in as moche as ?e may, the sacramentis seven, and reles of synne and grauntyng of grace, and Cristis bitter passioun ?e sette not at an hawe. Who marrith more matrimonie, ?e or the freris, Daw, I have askid questiones of thee and of thi freres; bot that I lied oones ou?t knewe I me not gilty, ffor Goddis lawe forbedith this in many place, I wene. And thow? I be Jak Uplonde, ?it drede I Goddis lawe. Bot I suppose thi secte tristith so meche in her habites, that thai kun lye of custom, as Peter prophecith of hem, Fuerunt pseudo-prophetÃ¦ in populis, magistri mendaces, etc. Bot to lie thus playnly and openly on men, ?e count it not synne, as ?our wordes shewen; ?our freres ben taken alle day with wymmen and wifes, bot of ?our privey sodomye spake I not ?ette. Bot lat see, Dawe, if thou, or any lyer of thin ordre, can preve this on oon of hem that clepest my secte, and sicerly shalle thou have of me an hundrith pounde.with wrenchis and wiles wynnen mennes wyves, and maken hem scolers of the newe scole, and reden hem her forme in the lowe chaier? To maken hem profit in ?our lawe thei rede ?our rounde rollis, and callen hem forth her lessouns with, âSister, me nedith.â Jak, thou seist that we bilden the castels of Caym. It is Goodis hous, oold schrewe, that we ben aboute, to mayntenen his servauntis to singe and to reden, and bidden for the peple, as we ben beholden. Clerkis sein that Salomon made a solempne temple, Daw, thou leggist Salomon for ?our hie houses; bot olde holy doctoures ben a?en thee here, and specialy Jerom, that saith in the lawe, who wil allege the temple for glorie of our chirche, fforsake he to be cristen, Jak, and be he newe a Jewe. 12 q. 2? Gloria episcopi. Ffor sith the pore lorde, he saith, halowed his pore chirche, take ?e Cristes crosse, he saith, and counte we delices claye. Daw, blaberere and blynde leder, thowg thou bigile symple hertes with thi gildyn glose, and with thi costly houses, thou bigilest not Jak with ?our thevishe logges. Unde in evangelio, vos autem fecistis eam speluncam latronum.and ?it was it bot figure of oure newe chirche, that ech holi hous that Crist him silf in dwellith. Jak, thou seist ful serpentli, and sowdiours us thou callist, sette for oure sutiltÃ© in Anticristis vaunwarde. Crist in the gospel rehersith a rewle, how ech man shal be knowun oonli bi his werkes; and if we were founden on Anticristis side, oure werkes shulden shewen, Jakke, ful soone. The werkes of Anticrist pursuen oure bileve, so do the disciplis of ?our sori secte, shending the sacramentes, salve to oure soris. Who tytheth bot ?e the anet and the mente, sterching ?our faces, to be holden holi, blaunchid graves ful of dede bones, wanderynge weder-cokkes, with every wynd waginge; the spiritis of the devel mateyn ?oure tokenys, thour? quenching of torches in ?ou tayl-ende Topias, thou writist me to be a lewed man; bot lewed men prechen not, as thou canst saye, bot if the list to lye. Bot I wot thou saist thus, by vertuouse prestes; bot thai ben ful bisie to edifie the chirche, that the multitude of ?ou han allemost destried. Ffor the gospel saith, Surgent multi pseudo-prophetÃ¦. Bot of hem ben fewe, and gretly dispiside; and of ?ou ful many, and ever tho mo the werse.?e resseyve ?our wisdom; ?oure preching is perilouse, it poiseneth sone, as honyed venym it crepit in swot. Jak, in the Apocalypse ful pertli ?e be peintid, whan the seven angels blowun there seven trompis, to warne Anticristis meynÃ© of our Lordes comyng, with her sterne stormes astonye al the erthe, reve men of her rest, and ferli hem afefe. The first angel with his blast he noieth ful sore, hayl and fier he myngit with blood he sendith to the erthe, by the tokenyng that ?our preching, Jak, makith obstinat hertis. ?our daliaunce inducit ire and envie. Who ben more Fariseis than hinderers of soulis, the which in her interpretacion divisioun ben callid; and ?our teching in an hour wil breke mo love-daies, than ?e mowe brynge togidere vij. ?ere after. The secounde aungel wit his blast smytith with drede, and an huge hill is sent adoun into the salt water; the thridde party of creaturis ben bitter therof, ffor Sathanas by ?our sawes is sent into soulis, that ben ful unsavery, and saltid by synne. The bitternesse of ?our bacbityng brewith many bales. The thridde angel sent doun a sterre from heven, bremli brennynge as a bround, wermode it was callid; wermode, Jak, moost verreli was Wiclif, ?our maister, withinne in his begynnynge litht lemed he by cunnynge, Me mervelith, Daw, thou darst thus lie on suche a gret clerke, and in hys tyme knowen wel a vertuouse man, of riche and pore that hym tho knewe. But thou, as blynde Bayarde, berkest at the mone, as an olde mylne dog when he bygynnith to dote. Bot wel I wot thi baffyng, lye thou never so lowde, may not menuse this seint, that lyved and tau?t so truly, Quia dignus est operari misericordiam.but aftir with wrong wrytyng he wrou?te mykil care, and presumynge perilously foul fel fro the chirche, missaverynge of the sacrament, infectyng many other. Thus brenneth he ?it as a bronde, consumyng many soulis, that in her hard obstinacy growen schides of helle. Maximine ne ManichÃ© nevere wrou?ten more wrake. Therfore from wele is he went, and woo mote him wrynge. The iiij? aungel with his blast smytith ri?t smerte; the iij. party of the sonne with dymmenes is dirked, off the moone and of the sterres, and of the day also; and the egle in the eyre thries vÅ! wescheth. The sonne is holy chirche, and lordship the moone, the sterres ben the comuns, as I seid bifore, I drede me, Dawe, the sentence, of whiche the prophet spekith, shal falle hevy on thin hede, and many of thi brether. VÅ vobis qui dicitis bonum malum et malum bonum. Ffor alle trwe sentence, that we taken here, thou turnest into falsenes, that woo shal the bitide; ffor to our secte that is Christis we drawen bot fewe puple; ffor thou and other pseudo han marrid hem in the way, that bot if God of his grace sende his honde of help, the chirche that shuld folowe Crist, is lykly to sinke. Qui mihi ministrat me sequatur. Attendite a fermento PharisÃ¦orum, quod est hypocrisis.and alle these ben alured to ?oure sory secte; and summe of ech of these astates ben privyly apoisond. Therfore thries vÅ! is manassid upon ?ou, ffor three manere of synnes that comunly ?e usen; vÅ for envye, vÅ for ipocrisie, and vÅ for ?our leccherie. Whan the first angel blew, ther was a pit opend, ther rose smotheryng smoke, and brese therinne, alle thei weren lich horses araied into bataile, thei stongen as scorpioun, and hadden mannis face, tothed as a lioun, with haburjouns of iren. This pitte is the depnes, Jak, of ?our malice; the smorthering smoke is ?our dymme doctrine, that flieth out from the flawmes of the develis malice, that troublith and blindith the i?en of mannis resoun. The breses ben not ellis but Anticristis menye, with short legges bifore and longe bihinde; the which pretenden first mekenesse of herte, and aftir rysyng to arrogaunce, disdeynynge al other. That ?e ben lyke scorpions, signefieth not ellis, but that ?e flateren aforn, and venym casten bihinde. ?e ben also lich horses redy into bateil, by woodnesse and foolhardinesse for heresie to dien. ?e ben tothed as lyoun by stynkyng detraccion. ?our haburjons that ?e han upon, ben cauteles and slei?tes. ech intrikid in other, to snarre symple soules; but that thei ben of iren, obstinacie is shewid, ffor the which with Farao in helle ?e wil be dampned. In the si?t of aungels blast foure aungels there were lousid, the whiche were redye bothe day and ny?te men for to noien, to sleen the ferthe part of men with fiyr, smoke, and brymstone. Ffoure angels singnefien foure general synnes, sett up bi sir Adam, Jakke, among ?our maistris, cediciouns, supersticions, the glotouns, and the proude. Poerte preamblis to presse aforne Anticristis comyng, to sleen the thridde party of men with ther deedly dartis off envie, pride, and leschry stynkynge. Ffor sum ben perfit, sum ben yvel, sum ben unstable; the perfit wole not ben hirt, the yvel ben al redy, but thei that ben unstable resseyven the strokes, and thei ben clepid the thridde part of hem that ben dede. The seventhe angel blew his trumpe, and noise in heven was made, that the kyngdom of this world shulde falle to Cristis hondis; betokenyng that thou? Anticrist, with his my?ti meynÃ©, shulde for a short tyme by tirantrie intrusyve, ?it shal God gader his flok togider, and rengne without eende. Jak, thus to dubby with scripture, me thinkith grete folie; ffor as lewid am I as thou, God wote the sothe, I know not an a from the wynd-mylne, Homo apostata, vir inutilis, graditur ore perverso. Dawe, thou hast li?t conscience, thus fynaly to deme; ffor here thou damnest men to helle without any condicion. Whe have leve of scripture to deme after mennes werkes, but for to deme as thou dost, is to robbe God of his power; ffor the apostil saith, Noli ante tempus judicare, quoadusque veniat Dominus. Litil wondir thow? lordis myssetyme, that han suche confusours. Quia si cÃ¦cus cÃ¦cum ducat, ambo in foveam cadunt. Thou saist thou knowist no lettre here, as if thou wer noo clerke. To take a clerke as it shuld be, after his undirstondyng, than sayst thou here more trwly than in any other place. Clark is als meche to mene, as of the sort of God, and so thou previst thi self non suche, if thou loke ri?t, but a liere apostata, with alle his other partes.ne a b from a bole foot, I trowe, ne thi silf nother; and ?it for al my lewidhed, I can wel undirstonde that this prevy processe perteneth to ?our secte, and we as giltles therof, as ?e of Cristis blessyng. It ar ?e that stonden bifore, in Anticristis vauwarde, and in the myddil and in the rerewarde, ful bigly enbatailid. The devel is ?our duke, and pride berith the baner; wraththe is ?oure gunner, envie is ?our archer, ?our coveitise castith fer, ?our leccherie brennith, glotony giderith stickes therto, and sleuthe myneth the wallis, malice is ?our men of armes, and trecherie is ?our aspie. Thus semith that ?e more than we be Anticristis frendis. Jak, of perfite pacience holilich holy chirche thou me prechist, to kep it if I will sitte on Cristis owne side; but, good Jak, herdist thou evere how judicare cam into crede? no more skil thou canst of paciens, Jak, so God me spede, ffor thi schreude herte and he ben as afere asundir as Lucifer is from heven, and Gabriel from helle, the which, as many man suposis, shal nevere mete togider. On old Englis it is said, unkissid is unknowun, and many men speken of Robyn Hood, and shotte nevere in his bowe. Now, Jak, to thi questions, nedes me moste answer, althou? thei wanten sentence and good thrift bothe. Which is the moost perfit ordre, Jakke, thou askist, and how many ordres ther ben in erthe. Off what ordre art thou, frere, and who made thin ordre? iff thou wolt have the hi?est ordre, seke it in heven, in the blessid TrinitÃ© that fourmed us alle, where flowith the Sunne from the Fadir, the Holigost from hem bothe; noon gretter in degrÃ©, no more perfite than other, but the ordre that there is, is in her proceding; and if we comen lower, there finde we holy angels, stablid in iij. ierarchies, dividid in ordres nyne. Seraphin he is the sovereynest, in charitÃ© he brennith; and of al ordris in erthe y holde preesthood the hi?est, that han the principal partis of men, and kingis han the bodies; and this is the popes decrÃ© in comoun lawe. ?e saye wirchipith God.But peraunter, Jak, thou menest of religious ordre, of templeres, hospitalers, chanouns, monkes, and freres, Jak, in this mater, loke seint Thomas bokes, and thei shal thee techen and enfourme at the fulle. How many ordris ther ben can I not telle, but if y cowde calkyn al manere kyndes, ffor to loken how many kyndes oure Lord hath yfourmed. But evermore betwene two and two, Jak, thou shalt fynden ordre. Off what ordre I am, and who made myn ordre, Jakke, fast thou fraynest, and fayn woldist wite. ?it, Daw, in this mater, thou broylist up many lesynges, ffor grounde of thin ordre not groundid in the gospel; ffor see thes thre vertues whiche thou here rehersist, ffaylen in thin ordre welny in every persone. Ffor in obedience and chastitÃ©, and poverte also, ?e folowen more Anticrist than Jhesu Crist our Lorde. ?e ben more obedient to ?oure owne reules, than to the reules of Crist groundid in lawes. And as to chastitÃ© of body, ?e breken it ful oft; bot chastitÃ© of soule, forsakyng Crist our spouse, ffor ?e ben apostatas, gon bak fro holi chirche. Initium omnis peccati apostare a Deo. As to verrei poverte, who that wil ri?t loke, ?e ben the most covetouse of alle men in erthe, ffor with symonye and begrye, and sellyng of shrift, ?e pillen bothe gret and smal, and prise hem of bileve Avaritia, quod est idolorum servitia.I am of Cristis ordre, Jak, and Crist made myn ordre, ensaumple in the gospel, in many sondry place, ffor who tau?te obedience, chastiti, and poverte? Hopist thou not it was Crist, and fulfillid in him silf, in which ech religion perfitli is groundid, reversynge the soorie synnes notid of the postle, lust of fleich and lust of i?e, and pride in oure lyvynge. On this three, Jak, by my ewtÃ©, is groundid al ?our colege. Iff I breke myn ordre, I breke Goddis lawe, and if I be punishid for that oon, I am ponishid for that other. Bot the contrarie of this, Jak, thou falsly afermest. If ony religioun be more perfit, than techith seint Jame, Jacke boy, either more appreved of God, fayne thou woldist witen. Iff I seie thee, thou askist where it is foundid; and if y nayt seie not that thou seist, thus thou procedist. Thou seist that I contrarie Cristis owne rewles, bidinge ?eve to be pore in peyne of dampnacion, and we piken from the pore and riche al that we may geten. Jak, thou shewist sikirli, what scole thou hast ben inne, of sutiltee of arguyng me thinkith thi brayn ful thinne. Go grees a shoep undir the taile, that semeth the beter than with sotil sillogismes to parbrake thi witt. Jack, in James pistles al religioun is groundid, ffor there is maad mencion of two perfit lyves, that actif and contemplatif comounli ben callid, ffulli figurid by Marie and Martha hir sister, by Peter and bi Joon, by Rachel and by Lya. Thes lyves ben groundid in charitÃ© by diverse degrees, by men of professiouns makyng sundri religiouns, and evident ensaumple moun techen us the waye. Dawe, thou ratelist many thynges, bot grounde hast thou non; ffor where groundist thou in Goddis lawe to close men in stones, bot if it were wode men, or giloures of the puple? Sith alle that is not groundid smacchith grete synne; bot if ?e taken as ?e usen arseworde this gospel, Non potest civitas abscondi super montem posita; ellis, neque accendunt lucernam et ponunt eam sub modio. Or wher fyndist thou, Dawkyn, that men shulden kille her brether? Sith Crist, our aller duke, brou?t us verrei pees, bot if there be of the rancs that ran fro Anticristis nose, Pacem relinquo vobis, pacem meam do vobis.Ffor sum fleen from the world, and closen hem silf in wallis, and steken hem in stones, and litil wole thei speken, to fleen sich occasiouns as foly wole fynden; and these we clepen ancres in the comoun speche. Also in contemplacion there ben many other that drawen hem to disert, and drye myche peyne; by eerbis, rootes, and fruyte lyven, for her Goddis love; and this manere of folk men callen heremytes. The thridde degree there is, not for to be dispisid, off sich as ben gaderid in coventis togidere; off the which men spekith David in his psalmis, sith he seith how merie it is to dwelle togidere; the which for worldly combraunce kepen in cloistris, on hert and oon soule havyng with the apostlis; and this clepe we monasticale, that kendly is knowun. Mo, Jak, in contemplacion ther be diverse degrees; and after that charitÃ© growith in hem, the more is her mede. Off actif lyf y shulde thee tellen, yf that y hadde tyme, and shewen how men by charitÃ© ben holden to helpe her bretheren; somme with paynymes for to fi?te, oure feith to defende; somme for to make purvyaunce for seke and for pore; somme for to preche to the puple aftir her synne askith; and somme in bothe lyves laboren full soore, liche unto the angels in Jacobus ladder. Touchyng this pagyn, Dawe, thi lesynges ben ful rif; ffor her thou spekist of twey lyves, and ?e don nother wel, ffor Martha groundid hir labour fully in Goddis lawe, so may not ?e ?our beggyng, ne ?our castelles nouther. But of contemplacion ?e usen not bot as foxes; so in this ?e leven Crist Martha and Marie both. As touchyng ?iftes to pore men, ?e pike that thai shulde have, bothe of godes and faithe of soule, I, Jak, can see non other. Panis egentium vita pauperis est; qui defraudat eum, homo sanguinis est. We can not make mariage, Dawe, ne pursue no divorse; we wynne not meche money with thes, as thi secte doth ful oft. Quod Deus conjunxit, homo non separet.See now, Jak, thi silf, how these bothe lyves opinli ben expressid in the epistle of James: cleen religioun it is, he seith, to visite the widewis, the fadirles and the modirles, to actif lyf expressid, and undefoulid us to kepen from al worldly werkes. Byhold of contemplacioun opinli he spekith; so this may be resonably the conclusioun of my tale, that no religion more is than techith sent Jame. Jak, thou seist we piken from the pore and from the riche, and not ?even a?enward, thou? that thei ben nedy; that almes is pykyng, y fynde it in thi boke, and I herde it nevere aforn in no maner scripture. But if alwey pikers, Jak, thou wolt us maken, ther we piken but seely pans, thi secte pikith poundis. What we ?even to the pore, it nedith not thee to telle; ffor almes-dede shul be hid, and sweten in thi hondis. Whi, bi mannes mariage, ?e ben weddid to ?our abitis wele harder than worldly men ben weddit to her wyves, which thei mowe leeve and lete go as longe as him list. Jak, for siche manere scole ?e cacchen Cristis curse, so freli to mayntenen ManichÃ©s errours, to make men breke her matrimonye, and leeve her wyves, and whanne the good man is oute, playe hey god rode. Jak, to oure abite be we not weddid more than eny preest is weddid to his coroun, that is over growun with heer, and he preest nevere the lesse; or ellis shulde every barbour make newe preestes. Ri?t so oure clothis maken us not men of religion, but oonli oure profession byndith us to the stake; and so apostasie mowen we maken in oure soule, liche men of religion abidinge in oure abitis. If Sathanas were transfigurid into his former fairnesse, trowist thou he were ou?t ellis but a dampnid aungel? and so not for the levynge of oure clothis we be not punishid, but bicause it bitokeneth forsakyng of oure reule; and, Jacke, no more than thi sadil makith thin hors a mere, no more makith oure abitis monkes ne freris. Jak, of oure presciouse clothis fast thou carpist, the which ben so fyne that noman werith better. Every man may perseyve apertli, Jakke, that thou liest. Were we no sendal ne satyn, ne goldun clothis, and these passen in presciousitee many foold ouris. But if my cloth be over presciouse, Jakke, blame the werer; ffor myn ordre hath ordeyned al in good mesure. Thou axist me, Jacke, of my grete hood, what that it meneth, my scapelarie and my wide cope, and the knottide girdil. I praise not, Dawe, the stremerre that thou herof spekest; bot of suche wide clothing, tateris and tagges, it hirtith myn hert hevyly, I wil that thou it wite. Bot ?our ypocrites habit, to whiche ?e ben harde weddid, doth more harm than thes, bi thes two skilles; oon for the coloure, that signifieth sadnes, whan ?e ben most unstedfast of any folk in erthe; another for ?our difformed shap, that signifieth ?our holines; so if it be soth that ?e therof saye, it wold with litil help make an ape a seint. The tipet is a comyn reule, if it be not superflue, and so it doth gode to bynde a mannes hede; bot ?our misse shapen shelde bihynde at ?our shulderes, blowith ?our ypocrisie, and blyndith many foles. Genimina viperarum, quis demonstravit vobis fugere a ventura ira.What meenith thi tipet, Jakke, as longe as a stremer, that hangith longe bihinde, and kepith thee not hoot? an hool cloith of scarlet may not make a gowne; the pokes of purchace hangen to the erthe, and the cloith of oo man my?te hele half a doseyne. Why is thi gowne, Jakke, widder than thi cote, and thi cloke al above as round as a belle, sith taille my?te serve to kepe thee from coold? Jak, answere thou to that oon, and I shal to that other. My grete coope that is so wiid, signefieth charitÃ©, that largeli longith to be sprad to sibbe and to frende, figurid in the faire cloith of Salomons table, and bi wedding garnement that Crist hadde at his feeste. My greet hood behynde, shapun as a sheeld, suffraunce in adversitee sothely it scheweth, herbi to reseyve repreef for oure Goddis sake; or ellis bisynesse of oure feith it may wel bitokene, whiche that ?e Lollardes constreyne ?ou to distroie. The scapelarie also that kevereth the schuldris, it bitokeneth boxumnesse dewe unto oure prelatis, and boxomly bere burthuns that they wole leyen upon us. Off the knottide girdel knowe I no mysterie; therfore what it meeneth axe frere menours. But, Jacke, amonge oure chateryng, ?it wolde I wite, whi that the Lollardis weren moost greye clothis; I trowe to shewe the colour that signefieth symplenesse, and withinne, seith Crist, ?e ben ravenous wolves. ?it, Dawe, me thynkith thou usist thi customale condicion, thou hast so lerned to lye, thou kanst not leve werk, bot ?it I am gladde thou groundist the on the gospel. Diabolus est audax, et pater ejus. The secte that thou seggist of, I wot, is Jhesu Cristis, tellen litil by clothing, bot now oon now other; thou? thou accuse the menours have I not to do, bot wel I wot ?e ben alle drawen in oo maner draggee. Lewde Dawe, whi laist thou forthe so many blunt resones? ffor Salomon spekith not of silence propirde to an house, bot of silence in iche place in tyme and in reson. Bot the cursid ypocrisie of etyng of ?our fleshe, shuld iche man despise for ?our rotun rewle, and so thes similitudes, with thes soluciones, ben not worthe the devellis dirt, Dawe.Whi, seist thou, holde we more scilence in oon hous than another, sith over al a man is holden for to seie the goode? To thi lewide question Salomon thus answerith, Est tacens sciens tempus apti temporis, et homo sapiens tacet usque ad tempus; tempus tacendi, tempus loquendi; et iterum, Sicut urbs patens et absque murorum ambitu, ita qui in loquendo non potest cohibere spiritum suum. Thus perfit scilens by scripture is approved. Jakke, if thou undirstonde no Latyn, go to thi paroche prest, and undir ?ou bothe, with Goddis grace, marren ?e wolen ful yvele. Whi also ete we no fleish in every hous iliche, but chesen therto an hous, and leeven another? Jak, if every hous were honest to ete fleish inne, than were it honest to ete in a gonge. Whi is not thi table sett in thi cow-stalle? and whi etist thou not in thi shipun as wele as in thin halle? But al is good ynow? for thee, where that evere thou sittist. Whi with not thi cow make myry weder in thi dish? But, Jacke, in this mater appose thou the monkes; for thei kepen this serimonie more streiter than freris. Moreover thou mevest, Jak, another mater; if oure patrouns be perfit, and oure reule also, whi renne we to Rome, to be assoilid of the oth that we han maad, and be popis freris? Jak, summe rennen to Rome, but mo ther ben at hoom, and dewli done her dever aftir that thei han chosen; and that the Lollardis forthinken sul soore. ?e wolden that there where oon lesse, ?e ?ave nevere tale, that ?e my?ten have ?our reyke and prechen what ?ou list, and with ?our privy pestilence enpoisoun the peple. Jak, that Judas was a shrewe, what was Crist the worse? and so that summe ben exempt, and rennen to ?our ritis, and summe bi apostasie ben Sathanas servauntis, whi shulde owre patrouns be ever the lasse perfit? Daw, thi wordes ben many, and ever medled with venym; ffor a?enes gode men strecche Jus malice, ne non of thilk Cristis secte that myn callist, bot a?enes heritikes, bosteres and lieres, whiche han chosen hem a reule with blabereres of Baal; and ?it shal tyde the tyme when Josie shal regne, and make an ende of suche fendes, and Cristis reule shal renue. ?ee, Jamnes and Mambres japid not so the kyng, as thou with thi cursid secte the kyng and the puple. Attendite a falsis prophetis, qui veniunt ad vos in vestimentis ovium. I til thee, Daw, without dout, thes wordes ben said of ?ou, with other pregnant prophecies of Peter and of Poule.âFferther more whi make ?e ?ou âas men dede? âsith in begginge ?e ben as quic âas ben ony other, âand unsemeli it is âto see deed men begge.â Jak, me thinkith thou lernedist nevere of Poulis pistlis, whiche in a fewe shorte wordes answerith to thi sentence, Quasi morientes et ecce vivimus; glossa, quasi morientes, i. de vitio in vitium secundum opinionem aliquorum, et ecce vivimus in bonis operibus in rei veritate. So thou? we ben deed to the world, after thin opynyon, ?it is oure soule in the bodi and grace in the soule. âWhi,â seist thou, âsuffre ?e not ?our children âto come into your conseil, âif it be good and able, âand aftir Goddis lawe?â A, Jak, mafey, me merveilith moche of thin lewidheed! Herdist thou nevere how Crist was transfigurid in the hil, and ther to his privytÃ© he chees but three apostlis, forbedinge hem to telle that conceil ony ferther, and so were there nyne fro that conceil refusid. Crist also took to him alle his twelve apostlis, and tretide of his passioun in ri?t privy maner, and the rude peple that folowiden knewe no thing therof. Shal we, Jak, therfore seie his conceil was not able, suspect and not good confourmed to Goddis lawe. Another cause resonable me thinkith I can telle, for counceil owith to be kept and not to be clatrid; and children ben ay clatringe, as thou wel knowest. Another skil may be groundid of Salomons sawis; to him he seith that is wiis it longith to kepe conceil; and children ful seldum ben foundun wiis. Jak, wolt thou telle thi knave as myche as thi wyf? Daw, thou laborist fast to lede thi self to helle, and blyndist many lewde foles with thi stynking brethe; ffor bi this apis argument that thou here now ratelist, he that drynkith a quart wyne most nedis drynk a galon. Bot a?en house in mesure, Dawe, grucche I ri?t nou?t; and thou? thou saye a scorne, a shepe house I have, that hath more grounde in Goddis lawe than alle ?our Caymes castelles; I thank God, I beldid it with trwe bygeten gode. Bot ?e ?oures with beggery, bargenyng and robberye; ffor grounde have thai non, bot if it be here. Non habemus hic manentem civitatem. Et idem, VÅ qui Ã¦dificatis civitatem in sanguinibus. Et, VÅ qui conjugatis domum ad domum.Fforthermore thou spekest of oure costli houses; thou seist it were more almes to helpen the nedy, than to make siche housynge to men that ben deede, to whiche longith but graves and mornynge housis. Jak, is not a man beter than a rude best? ?it makist thou to thi sheep a shepen, and to thi hors a stable; and many a pore man ther is that hath noon hillyng, but oonly heven is his hous, the bestes stond kevered. Whi houses thou not pore men as wele as thi beestis? Take hede to sumwhat that is seid biforen, and thou answere to my question, answer to thin owne. Thou carpist also of oure coveitise, and sparist the sothe; thou seist we ben more ryal than ony lordis. Coventis have wee noon, Jack, but cloistrers we ben callid, ffoundid afor with charitÃ©, or that he were flemyd; but sith entride envie, and renyd hath oure houses, that unnethes the hillinge hangith on the sparres; and ?it thou thinkist hem over good, yvel fare thou therfore! Jak, where saw thou ever frere houses, thour?out the rewme, liche in ony rialtÃ© to the Toure of Londoun, to Wyndesore, to Wodestoke, to Wallingforde, to Shene, to Herforde, to Eltham, to Westmynster, to Dover? How maist thou for rebukyng lye so lowde, to saye that oure covetise passith the lordes? But so longe, by my leutÃ©, thou hast lerned to lyen, that thi tonge is letteroun of lyes, thou lettest for no shame. ?it, Dawe, thow? thou accusest pardoneres that ben fals, thou lovest lesse a trwe prest than thou dost hem alle, ffor thai gon heere ?ou apostatas in gilyng of the puple. Bot that ?e ferme to limitours, it maye be denyed, lye thou never so lowde, and therto sette a sele, bote thus with many fals meenes oppresse the cuntrees. Bot as to payng of tribut, as Crist hym self did, thou lyknist ?ou to Pharoes, and so ?e ben and werse. A?enes Cristes paying and alle other mekenes, thou autorisest ?our pride, a?enes his holi werkes. Qui non est mecum, contra me est; et qui non colligit mecum, dispergit.We leten, thou seist, to lymytours al this rewme to ferme, as that we were welders and lordes of alle. Unsikir thing sothli it were to sette to ferme, and fooles were the fermeres to taken it to tax. I trowe thou menys the pardonystres of seint Thomas of Acres, of Antoun, or of Runcevale, that rennen so fast aboute; for of the kynges rewme have we no more astate, than thou hast of paradis, or of the blisse of heven, for the which y trowe thou maist of hasilwode singe. Why, seist thou, paye ?e to no taliage to oure cristen kynge, sith Crist paiede tribut to the hethene emperour? Jak, of no dewtÃ© ne of no dette paide Crist noo tribute; but oonliche of mekenesse performynge the lawe, and for to fleen occasioun of aftirward apechinge, whan that afore Pilat he shuld be forjugid. But aftir the scripture, preesthode shulde not paien to tax ne to taliage with the comun peple. For whan the folk of Israel were put undir servage, Pharao suffride preestes in her former fredome to be saved and susteyned of the comoun store. But now is the compleynt of Jeremye trewe, the prince of provynces sugette is under tribute. Not for thanne the comun lawe may wel suffren, that preesthode may paye bi assent of prelatis, ffreli of her owne wille no thing constreynede, and thus prelatis and persouns aftir her state, ben stended to paien what that nede askith; but neither freres ne annuellers, save now late. God woot, it worchipith not to beggen of beggers. Off lettris of brotherhood also, Jak, thou spekist, and wounders that we wynnen noon of pore men and of preestis; and ?it ?e desiren that every man shulde have ?our; of pore mennes preieris to be parteners we wolden, and of her lettris and of her sele, if autentike thei weren. But of ?our preestis pater-nosters we desiren noon, for comunliche her blake bedes thei delen to freris; Dawe, I seide first to thee oon of thi groundes was eirsyng, whare autorisist thou this lewde answere nowe. Thi resones ben a staf of rede that li?tly persen the honde, I mervel that thou, a clerk, blaberist thus blyndely. Thou takest comynly no grounde of Crist ne of his lawe, bot apr the pope as if he were thi God, or of other fantasies that han no grounde hem self; ffor whi shuld not alle prestes be meke after Crist, in payng of tribut and alle other werkes? Daw, late thi false glose, it drivith thee to the devel. Benedicite et nolite maledicere.but thei shal cleve unto thi chekes, and Cristis curse also, as wysly as we holde us not more perfit than ony other, ne non suffragies selle for a certeyn bi ?ere, ne maken men more perfit than her blessid baptisme; ffor praier may not satyllyn but oonliche on them alle, and so that gilden trentels that thou spekist of, that now is purchasid of preestis out of freris hondis, delyverith noo soule out of the peyne of helle, ne purgen may of purgatory, but as it is deserved. Ffor charitÃ© is the mesure that demeth that meynÃ©. Also thou seist, Jak, that we men enformen that oure holy abite shulde helpen men fro helle, and nameliche tho that be beried therinne; and Cristis clothis dide not so, ne noon of the apostlis. Jak, that frere was over lewid that lernede the this lessoun, or on thi ficul fantasie thou faynyst this fable. Ffor Austyns ne prechours proponen no siche pointis. Whether the Carmes of her copes mayntenen siche an errour, or whether seint Fraunce hath geten to his habite that vertu be his grace, witterly me ne wote. But wel I wote that Cristis cloith helide a womman ffrom the longe fluxe of blood, as the gospel tellith; but his predestinacion may onlich save soulis, and his prevy presciens may dampne whom him list. Jak, ferthermore of felony thou felly us enpechest, of stelyng of children, to drawe hem to oure sectis. To tille folk to God-ward, I holde it no theft, but if thou calle Crist a theef, that dide the same, sayyng to the riche man, âGo and selle thi goodis, âand ?if hem to the pore, â?if thou wole be perfit; âand aftirward folowe me, âand be my disciple.â And in the same gospel se what he seith also: âWhoso forsaketh not âhis fadir and his modir, âhis sone and his dou?tir, âhis sistir and his brother, âhis lond and his tenementes, âand him selven also, âhe nys not worthi âto ben my folower.â And to his twelfe chosen eftsoones he seide, âBehold, from the world âI have chosen ?ou alle, âthat ?e gon and beren frayte, âand ?our fruyte may dwellyn.â Lo, Dawe, with thi draffe, thou liest on the gospel; ffor Crist said it hym self, âThe vertu passid fro me.â And here thou maist see, I knowe a b fro a bole fote; ffor I cacche thee in lesynges that thou laist on the gospel. Bot thus to stele a childe is a gretter theft, than to stele an axe, for the theft is more. Dawe, for thou saist ?e robbe him fro the worlde; ?e maken hym more worldly than ever his fadir; ?ee, thow? he were a plowman, lyvyng trwe lyf, ye robbe hym fro the trwe reule, and maken hym apostata, a begger and a sodomit; for suche thai ben many. VÅ vobis qui facitis unum proselytum! supple, filium GehennÃ¦ duplo quam vos.And thus to reven the world, and spoilen him of his persouns, it ne is no robery, but Crist appreved thefte. Thou seist also ferthermore that prestis shul not enprisoun, ffor it nys not foundid in al Goddis lawe, but undermyn bi charitÃ©, and so wynnen her brother, and ?if he wil not be so wonnen, have him as hethene; and thus bi thin opynyon no man shulde be enprisound. But, Jakke, in thi frensy, thou fonnest more and more, thou wenyst to make to me a diche, thou fallist thi silf therinne. Ffor if thou pursue thi purpos, thou assentist thi silf in tresoun, menusynge the kyngis majestÃ©, privyng him of his power. Daw, I do thee wel to wite, frentike am I not; bot it semith thi sotil witte marrith many man. Bot how stondith this togedir, ?e sle men in ?our prison? ?e have ?our conspiracies, when ?e gode likith, ?e damme the trwe, ?e hyen the false, deme, Dawe, wher this be gode. And the kyng by his juges trwe execute his lawe, as he did now late, whan he hangid ?ou traytours; wilt thou, Dawe, allegates compere ?ou to the kyng, or to other lordes, that han her grounde in God? Lefe, fole, thi losengerie, and studie Cristis lyf. QuÃ¦ conventio Christi ad Belial? Quid communicabit cacabus ad ollam?For if we taken the gospel aftir the menynge, nether emperour ne kyng may honge ne drawe, heved ne enprisoun, no haunte no domes, but al in fair manere shulen ben undirnomen, and who wil not amenden him, ?eve him the brydil; and be robberis and revers, mansleeris and treytours, and al maner mawfesours shulden ben unponnishid. Jak, the pope hath a prisoun, the bishop of Cantirbury, and of Londoun also, and many other bishopis, by leeve of her kyng; art thou hardy to seien it is not Goddis lawe. But y blame thee not gretli, thou? thou bere hem hevy; ffor goldsmythis of thi crafte ofte haveth hem haunted, and ?it thei shulen ofter, bi the helpe of heven. Also thou seist no sacrament we covetyn ne desiren, but shrift and biryyng, that longeth to the peple. Alas, Jak, for shame! whi art thou so fals, ffor to reverse thi silf in thin owne sawes? Thou seidist in thi begynnynge, whan thou seidist of freres, thei sellen seven sacramentes with Symoundis eyris; and now that we coveite noon but the sacrament of schrifte. Ffor beriynge is no sacrament, but an almes-dede. Thou jawdewyne, thow jangeler, how stande this togider, by verrÃ© contradiccion thou concludist thi silf, and bryngest thee to the mete there I wolde have thee. Who wolde take entent to suche wreches wordes, that nevere more ?eveth tale to be take with a lesyng? Whi, axist thou ferthermore, wil we not shryven ne birien the pore as wel as the riche, and do other dedes of almes done at her nede? But if we schryve not the pore, whi ben perssons so wrothe, and paroche preestes also, for schryvynge of her paishens? For every Lenten us a?en thei aleggen the lawe off omnis utriusque sexus, with the favourable glooses. But, Jak, do thi won, and lette not to lyene; I have as leef thy leesing as thi soth saw. Ffor who is oonis suspect, he is half honged. Thou seis that we prechen fallace and fables, and not Goddis gospel to good undirstondinge; and we ben more holdun therto than to alle other reulis. For we wynnen more therwith than Crist and his apostlis, what we ben holdun and wil not forsake. For moche of oure lyvynge is of the gospel; so dide Poul and other disciples, and lyvede of colectis made generali bi chirchis, ffor sustinance of prechours, and also of the pore. And if thou leve not me, loke Poulis pistlis, and the glose therwith, and there thou shalt fynde it. Quis, inquit, militat suis stipendiis unquam? Et iterum, Dominus ordinavit iis qui evangelium annunciant de evangelio vivere. And so to his prechours Crist also thus seide, In quamcunque domum intraveritis, manete in eadem edentes et bibentes, etc., dignus est enim operarius mercede sua. Et ad Romanos, Probaverunt Macedones et Achaia collationem facere in pauperes sanctorum qui sunt in Jherusalem. Daw, hou maist thou saye for shame that Crist stale thus childre, and Poule beggid as ?e don, ?e lyven bi the gospel? ?ee, Dawe, ?e selle derrere lesynges and poyson, than ever did Poule alle his holy writyng; ever thou likynest ?ou to Crist, whan ?e ben verrei Anticrist. And if bisshopes byside wel to knowe alle ?our dedes, thai founde ?ou werse than harlotes, or jogulours ether; ffor ?e begge or ?e preche many tymes and oft, somen men and threten hem, bot if thai ?if ?ou gode. Bot the harlot wil drawe the blode of his arse, or he ask any gode, or any rewarde. And, Dawe, truly ?our dedes contrarie Crist. Mordent dentibus et prÃ¦dicant pacem, et si quis non dederit in ore eorum quippiam, sanctificant super eum prÃ¦lium.A?ens that that thou saist that we prechen but fallace and fables, and leve the gospel that moste us al save, loke that every werke is knowen, plenili bi his eende, and so the peple hath the pathes of feith and of bileve, and God woote freres prechinge hath wrou?t to this ende. But ?e han cast cursidly Cristendome to distroye, and of Cristis gospel make Machometis lawe, a?ens whom with opin mouth other while we romee, and sum tyme brynge ?ou til a bay if God wil it graunte. For this cause ?e calle us bastard branchis, pursuyng preestes to prisoun and to fire also; Daw, here thou blaberist togedir falsenes and trouthe; ffor a bastarde is he that holdith a?enes the sothe. God and trwe men discusse wher that be ?e or I. Ffor if thou seyst holi chirche the techyng of Crist, the reules of apostles, the lyf of hem alle, I summitte me to hem, and wil wile I lyve. If thou callist, Dawe, ?our Dominikis reules, with determinacion of many false prestes, holi chirche, as I wene, as oft thou hast done, I forsake the for ever, with this cursid chirche, Odivi ecclesiam malignantium. If thou purposist to pursuwe and drawe men to dethe, I mervel not meche, for it is thin office. The fadires of freres, whiche were the Pharisees, pursuwed Crist to the paynful dethe, ?e, callid hym a blasfeme, as ?e clepen hem heritikes that holde a?enes ?our falsehede, alle if thai men truthe. Et vos implete mensuram patrum vestrorum.but, Jak, thei ben bastard braunches that launchen from oure bileve, and writhyn wrongli away from holy chirche techinge, siche beren yvel fruyte and soure to atasten, worthi to noon other good, but in the fire to brenne; and so for to pursue an heretike to fire or to prisoun, I holde it more holsum than to halewe a chirche, inprisonynge of the poysen that mortherith many soulis, aftir Cristis doctrine in the holy gospel. Omnis, inquit, arbor quÃ¦ non fert fructum bonum, excidetur, et in ignem mittetur. Et iterum, Qui non manserit in me, mittetur foras sicut palmes, et arescet, et colligent, et in ignem mittetur. Disseverynge ?ou from the tree that is Crist him silfe. But how shulden freres pursue heresie, and many of hem wite not what heresie meneth. Jak, I am not lettered, but I am frere Dawe, and can telle wel a fyn what heresie amounteth; heresie, that is Grw, is divisioun on Latyn, the whiche in oure langage meneth sunderyng and partyng. He thanne that sundrith him from Crist and his chirche, and frely forgith sentences contrarious to oure feith, siche manere of forgers heretikes we callen, and also her felowis taken the same name, and her sory sentences ben clepid heresies, but namely when thei ben holdun of obstinat hertis. And I shal this mater more largely declare. Sixe maner of heretikes ben foundun in the lawe. For he is callid an heretike that rasith oure bileve; and he is callid an heretike that heresies sowith, as Arrians, Wyclyfanes, Sabellyanes, and other; and the corruptours of scripturis heretikes ben holdun, that other wise undirstondin than the Holi Goost techith. Also we clepen hem heretikes, that sacramentis sellyn, or ben from hem dividid bi cursynge of the chirche. He is also an heretike that doutith our bileve, and with a litil evydence goith out of the waye. And also an heretike him shulde we holde that distrieth privyleges grauntid of the pope. This sixe maners put Hostiensis in his Summe, and if this sentence be soth, y can noon other seien, but thou and thi secte ben heretikes alle. Jak, thou spekist ferthermore of messis and of preires, and askist what we sellen, wen we seyen oure messe, whether the sacrament, our preieres, or our traveile; and if ony of this we done, thou arguest a greet errour. Jak, unto this questioun on wyse may be answerith, aftir that seint Austyn spekith of the apostlis. The apostlis a seye reseyved freely her breed of hem that freely token her techinge; and so, Jak, freely graunte we our masse to hem that freely ?even us her almesse, and synnen no wyse bi noon other vice, to selle no sacramentis ne spiritual preier. And thus among freres gete thei no logginge, but bete hem to gretter men and geten her herbegage, of patronis of chirchis, or privyly with preestes, wich to fatte benefices wolde be promotid. Daw, thou hast lerned so long to lye, thou wenest thou saist soth whan thou liest most lewde, and sclaunderist the truthe. Thou saidist thou were no lettred man, thou prevest thi self fals, ffor thou spekist of ierarchies, of herisies also; thou art gilty in alle thes poyntes, and thi brether bothe, that I wolde preve apertly, if that the tyme suffrid. Lok ?our lyvyng, ?our prechyng, with other opun dedes, and laye it by the apostles lyf, and se how thai acorde, and as I wene the Holigost appreveth nether nouther. Me thynkith ?e ben tapsteres, in alle that ?e don; ?e tappe ?our absoluciones that ?e bye at Rome, ?our prechyng, ?our praying, and also ?our beryings. Bot thou accusist other men that han bot the mote in the comparison of alle ?our gret synnes. Hypocrita, ejice primo trabem de oculo tuo. Dawe, ?e folowen Crist, as greyhounde doth the hare; ffor as God ?af kyng Saule in his wodenes, so ?e ben clekkid out to pursuwe holi chirche. Periculum in falsis fratribus.Jak, I suppose That my labour y selle, what wil thou seie therto, do y ony symonye? How than shal the persons seye that setten her chirches to ferme, that ben more spiritual than bodili traveile; and these paroche preestes that ministren the sacramentis, for a certen sawd bi ?eer of ten mark or of twelfe; and al these annuellers that syngen for a tyme, takyng for her traveil as thei may acorde; but thei can answere for hem silf, and we shal for us. Another mater ther is meved, that touchith begging; thou seist that we falsly Crist him silf disclaundren, to seie that he beggid, sith he was lord of al, and al in his demeyns. ?it, Dawe, thou drawist in many fals promptynges, ffor to hirt symple men, bot me never a del; ffor Crist in his membres beggid ful oft, ffor synne of the puple, when thai were at mischef. Bot as suche bolde beggers in bodily hele, begged never Crist, ne non of his membres; ffor Crist, that is truthe, may in no wise contrarie him self ne God that is his fadir; ffor in many places thai damnen suche sturdy beggyng, And, so, Dawe, thou dotest, alleggyng the water, the asse, or the herberowe; for he was lorde of alle, and so thou mysse takist Jerom, and lyest on Bernarde, ffor Alrede his clerke wrote his reson, that thou mysse layst, and dokkist it as the likist. Herfor a clerke saith, that evel mot he spede, that beggith of the puple more than is nede. Mendax mendicus non est veritatis amicus. Nutantes transferantur filii ejus et mendicent. God gif the grace to knowe how thou art Judas childe; whiche psalme thou leggist to me, as to an evel entent; for ?it thou schuldest be damned softly in helle, Nutantes transferentur filii.But for this mater, Jacke, thou most undirstonde, that Crist in his godhede is lord of alle thingis, as testimonie of Scripture preveth in many places; as touching his manhood he was nedi and pore, for of his nede spake David in his psalmes. Ego, inquit, mendicus sum et pauper, et Dominus solicitus est mei. And after Austin and Jerom this word of Crist was seid, so thanne these twey stonden wel togidere, that Crist after oo kynde was lord of alle, and after that other nedide to begge. For if Crist seie soth, him silf ne hadde noon harborow, to resten in his owne heed, and steken out the stormes. Vulpes, inquit, etc., ubi caput suum reclinet. And if we shulen ?eve credence to doctours wordes, heere what seith seint Jerom, and seint Bernard also. Cave, inquit Jeronimus, ne mendicante Deo tuo alienas divitias augeas; et Bernardus. Ut te, Domine, per omnia nostrÃ¦ paupertati conformares, quasi unus in turba pauperum stipem per hostia mendicabas. Wherfore thou feynest fonnedli that oure Lord we sclaundre; or ellis oure holy doctours diden not her dever. Jak, have no merveyle that y speke Latyn, for oones I was a manciple at Mertoun halle, and there y lernede Latyn by roote of clerkes. Of clamourus also begging thou chaterist and criist, and seist it is uttirli forbodun in Goddis lawe. how thes to acorde.Jak, the blynde begger sat bi the weye, and lowde criede uppon Crist, as the gospel tellith; but him was ?ovun i?e-si?t, for al his grete noise, and also the pore man at the specionus ?ate praiede to the apostlis to parten of her almes; and ther the begger unreproved of crokidnesse he was heelid. I for?ete not the lazar that beggide of the riche, and criede lowde at his ?ate to cachen his almes. Where redist thou that he was repreved of his begging? I rede wel he was ful soone in Abrahams bosum. Thou makist also more ado for writing in oure tablis of sich mennes names that ?even us her almes, âWenynge that God were a fool, ânot knowinge mennes dedes, âbut if he were mengid âbi weie of ?our writyng.â ?it, Dawe, thou hewist hye, and puttist thi mouthe in heven; thi tong likkith the chesefat, and the garner also, and the pore wedowes porse, thow? she have bot a peny. And ?it, Dawe Dotypolle, thou justifiest this harlotrie; whi lykkennest thou writyng of names, which thou dost for money, to the holi scripture, that is our bileve? Ffor God ne any godeman appreved never this symonye; but thou approvest ?our capped maistres with a glasen glose, whiche galpen after grace bi symonye ?our sister, and after sitten on hie dece and glosen lordes and ladies. And this is no liknes bitwix my knave and hem; ffor of thes and suche it ben that Crist specth in his gospel. Amant enim primos recubitus in cÅnis, et primas cathedras in synagogis, et vocari ab hominibus Rabbi.Jak, writyng was ordeyned for slipernes of mynde, not of God, but of us men, hirt in oure nature, and bi bodili buystousnesse fallen to for?etynge. Now special preier, as clerkes seien, moste helpeth the soulis, and that may not be done withouten special mynde. Thanne for oure for?etfulnesse it nedith us to noten, and this is cause whi we writun in oure tablis. And Esdras wroot a newe book, to have the lawe in mynde. To seint Joon in the Apocalips it was bodun also, that privy revelacion to writun in his book, for unstabilnesse of mynde, seith the comoun glose. âWhi,â also thou axist, âmake ?e so many maistris, âa?ens Cristis bidding âin the holi gospel?â For sothe, Jak, among other, this is a lewid question. Taking heed to thin astaate, thou art but a knave, and ?it thou lokist that thi knave shulde calle thee maistir. Leve Jacke Jawdewyn, how kepist thou the gospel? Nevertheles to thi question answerith the comoun glose, that neithir the acte of teching, neither the acte of maistir, ben forbodun of Crist, but oonli ambicion, and the nyce appetite of worldly worship. Thou askist also ferthermore, whos ben alle oure jewels; and we seyen we han ri?t nou?t in propre ne in comoun, but gederen the goodes of the rewme to make the pope riche. Jak, the foure and twentithe pope Joon wroot a?ens this mater, and frere menours a?ens him, as her actis shewen. Examyne her actis and loke who hath the beter, and knowe noon other ordre this perfitnesse approveth. Daw, thou herdist me not grucche that ?e went two togedir; ffor otherwhile ?e gon three, a womman is that oon. Bot whether ?e go two or oon, if ?e wol do wele, it were a gret joye to me, God wot the sothe. Bot wel I wote that charitÃ© may not duelle there, where covetise crepith in, and lecherie is loggid. Therfor, Dawe, allegge thou no figur for thin ordre, bot if it be Zambre with Corby his lotby, or Jamnes and Mambres, Pharaouse freres. Hi sunt qui penetrant domos, et ducunt mulierculas oneratas peccatis.Thou grucchist also that we gon two of us togider; for of the perfit apostlis wenten but oone aloone. Thou seist that we pretenden the perfeccioun of apostlis. Parfay, Jak, in scripture thou failist here ful foule, herdest thou nevere the processe of the actis of the apostlis, in what maner the Holi Goost chees BernabÃ© and Poule, to gone bothe togidere, and Cristis seed to sowun; and aftirward whan Bernabas from Poul was departid, another felowe, TymothÃ©, toke Poul to his feere. And ?it thei weren perfit bi fastinge and bi preieris, and resseyved hadde the Holi Goost bi the apostlis hondis. And thus we gon two togider, folwinge her stappis; but more for the mysterie includid in the noumbre, for to bi workes of charitÃ© fulfilling the lawe; and two tablis of Moises there the lawe was writun; and two cherubyns in the temple, and two in the tabernacle. It was not good to Adam for to be aloone; and Crist seith woo to sool in aventure that he falle. Also for fraternitÃ© ful harde thou us holdist, to graunt part of merit, and also of messis, bicause that we witen not whether that we ben in grace or in synne, and happili for we praien for suche that ben dampned in helle. Jak, if this cause were good, al preier were reproved, and thanne were set at nou?t bothe messe and matynes, and holy bedis and orisons seid in holi chirche. with Judas ben ?oure fadirs.Thanne shulde we leve Cristis bede, the holy pater-noster. Thanne was the memento put fally in the masse, and hooli chirche voidli or madli biddith preye, and alle siche ?onge impossibilitees folowen therof. For who is that that knowith him silf worthi for to preien, but God bi revelacion specially wolde it shewe; for noman, seith the scripture, woot, whether he is worthi love, or ellis maugree but God it oonly knowith. And who can telle ferthermore whiche shulde be dampned, sith Goddis privy domes man may not comprehende; and so shal noman preie for other, ne noman for him silf. Jak, se now thin errour, and sum tyme sesse for shame; for thou jangelist as a jay, and woost not what thou meenest. Moreover thou monest multipliyng of so many freris, whiche encresen combrouseli, a?ens Goddis wille; sith preestis with other religious my?te serve the peple, for twelve apostlis and fewe moo serveden al the world, and mo fyngris on myn hond than foure and the thombe amenusith my worching more than it acresith; and so thou seist that freris letten Cristis growinge into heven. Jacke, thou weenest thou wynne lond, but thou concludist thi silf; thou seist that God alle thingis hath maad in mesure, wei?te, and noumbre, and that every frere is sum thing, thou maist not denye, and thou seist freris ben maad a?ens Goddis wille. Than hath God maad sum thing that he wolde not make, and so his sovereyne goodnesse is contrarious to him silfe. Lo, Jakke Jospinel, what folowith of thi sawis. Jakke, if thou? a fewe moo my?te serven al the world, thanne my?te a fewe preestes serven a litil rewme. Whi renne thanne these ?onge clerkes so faste to the ordres, to encresen preestes above mony hundridis? And if freris ben combrouse, preestis ben wel more; or ellis telle a beter skil thanne thou hast begunne, whi the toon is chargeaunt more than the tother. Also the ensaumple of thin hond is no thing to purpos; for kynde hath determyned the noumbre of thi fyngris, and if it passe noumbre, it is clepid monstruositÃ©; but God and holi chirche determyned noo noumbre of preestis ne of freris to helpen mannis soule. For the mo good ther ben, the better is Cristis spouse; and thou? fewer my?ten done that nedis, ?it many hondis togider maken li?t werk. Oft, Dawe, in thi writtyng, thou wryngist out contradiccion; but ?it thou puttist defaut to prestes, as erst thou didist to curates. I wot thai ben defectif, bot ?it stondith Cristis religion, of whose defaut I dout not, Dawe, ?e ben the chef cause. Bi this it suwit not God, bot Sathanas brou?t ?ou in. Thou saist, Dawe, as thou felist, that there is Cristes body; bot I afferme faithfully that that is Cristis body; Daw, aske thi cappid maistres, as if thai were heritikes, what is the sacred host, and grounde hem in scripture, to whiche we knele and doffe our hodes, and don alle this wirchip, and I bileve that oste sacred, whiche is bothe whit and rounde, is verrei Cristis body, as men shuld bileve, and did to the tyme that Sathanas was unbounde. The wittnesse of this reson is Crist and his apostles, with many holi doctouris of the thousande ?ere. Bot this ?e falsely forsake, with alle ?our secte, or many, and blynden the puple with heresie, and leven Goddis lawe; ffor ?e sayen ther is Cristis body, and nou?t that sacred host. Commutaverunt veritatem Dei in mendacium.Another mater thou movest, Jak, moost to be chargid, of the solempne sacrament of Cristis owne bodye, conteyned in figure of brede, sacrifise for synne; thou drawist a thorn out of thi hele, and puttist it in oure. Thou berist us on honde that we seien ther is not Cristis bodye, but roundnesse and whitenesse, and accident withouten suget. Jak, we seie with holy chirche, that ther is Cristis bodi, and not material breed with Wiclyf ?our maistir, the whiche put ther but as a figure, and not verrÃ© Cristis bodi, after a manere spekyng that holy chirche usith, as we clepen Crist a stoon, a lomb, and a lioun, and noon of these is Crist, but oonli in figure. This heresie holde not we, but ?e his false folowers, privyly as ?e doren, and opinli ?e wolden, ne were the sharp ponishinge of ?our former fadirs. And now I will thee telle the freris confiteor, touching to this sacrament, how that thei bileven. Thei seie breed is turned into fleish, and wyne into blood, thour? the my?t of oure God, and vertue of his wordis; the fleish is mete, the blood is drynke, and Crist dwellith [therin], no thing rasyd, no thing dividid, but oonli broken in signe, and as moche is in oo partie as is al the hole; thus leeveth not of the breed, but oonli the licnesse, which that abidith therinne noon substeyned substans. It is deth to the yvel, lyf to good encresing of oure grace. It wole not be confect but oonli of a preest, that lawfulli is ordeyned bi holi chirche keies; and so carpenters ne sowters, card-makers ne powchers, drapers ne cutellers, girdelers, coferers, ne corvysers, ne no manere of artificeris, this sacrament mowe treten, but the privitÃ© of preesthode wer prickid in her soulis. And ?it ?our sect susteynes wommen to seie massis, shewyng to trete a sacrament as preestes that thei were, reversynge holy doctours and decree of holy chirche. ?it spekith Jak Uplande. To make with the a dialogge, I holde it bot wast, for thou maryst thy lesynges lowde with thy false heresyes; men may se by thy writing, here, thou jangelyng jay, how thou bylevest not in the sacrid oste, for we sey alle, the sacrid oste that is sene with eye is verey Cristes body; but thy secte seyth not soo, but ?e say ther is Cristes body, ?e tel not where. But Crist seyth, this is my body, and not, ther is my body. Whi, ?e templers messe sellers, grante ?e not Cristes wordes, syth ?e chafyr thus therwith, bygylyng the pupil? Lete ?oure secte write ?oure byleve of this sacrid oste, and preche it as ?e write it, and sette therto ?oure sele, and I am siker of my feith ?e schul be stonde to deth; and than schal ?oure castels cache hem new maysters, for ?e wil not grante, ne bot few of ?oure ordirs, the ost sacrid, white and rounde, is verey Cristis body. I pray oure Lord Jhesu, that sone be it sene, who is in the trew wey, whether ?e other we. But towching men of crafte, whom thou dispisyst, al they schulde medle hem to know her byleve, but as wele of her sacryng, as wymmen syngynge messe, alwey thou usest the craft of thyn old fader. Why darst not thou of summe of ?ou false heretykis, fynde owte such on, and preve ?oure lesynges sothe. And therfor, Daw, I sey nomore to the at this tyme, but thou ert on of the falsest that ever I saw write. For Mahomete and Serginus, and al her grete lawe, wot not so many lesynges as ben here in thy writynges.Allas! ?our brymme blastis awake the wilde wawlis, and scalen sely Peter ship, and putt it in hi?e perile; ne were God the giour, and kept the stern, with the sterne stormes that reufulli ?e reisin, al schulde wende to wrak into the waast watris. The releef of Cristis feeste ?e renden and ratyn, that his alumners the postlis gaderid togidere, and delith it to dogges and ravenous beestes; and the presciouse perlis ?e strowun to hogges, the sutil metis of scripturis to cherlis stomakes, and maken hem als comoun as the cart weye, a?ens Poulis sentence, and Poulis owne doctrine. Non, inquit Paulus, potui vobis scribere quasi spiritualibus, sed quasi carnalibus, etc. Se also what Crist seith, in the holy gospel. Multa habui vobis dicere, sed non, etc. Also in many other place thus spekith he to his perfit disciplis: Vobis datum est noscere mysterium regni Dei, cÃ¦teris autem in parabolam, etc. Than the lewide and the lered au?t not yliche, the scripturis ben scaterid in his privy pointes. Jak, thou seist at the last, that charitÃ© is chacid, to vengyn oure defautis, and mende us of oure mysse, levynge oure rotyn ritis, folowinge Goddis lawe. Jak, oure ritis ben nou?t rotyn, her rootis ben al freishe, plantid in the gospel, as I seide biforen; but, good Jak, ?our grace, where be ?e foundid? not in Goddis gospel, but in Sathanas pistile, wher of sorowe and of snowcrie noon is to seken, but al maner of dolositÃ© to ?ou is enditid, as in thi lewid daliaunce apertli thou hast preved; but moche mawgrÃ© mote thou have thus to frayn a frere, that slily wolde have slent aweye, and noman have greved. But for thi grete labour thi gardoun thou shalt gete; thou shalt have the popis curse, and al holi chirchis; and if thou sett this at nou?t, God mowe sende thee more, the curse that he hath ?ovun to Caym and Choreis sone also; thou shalt also have the curse that Crist ?af to Phariseis, figured in the figre tree that nevere bare fruyte aftir. Thou shalt have the weleaway of Gelboth hilles, the sorowe of Sodome, and al sinful citeis. Take for thi faire speche the preier of Deus laudem, the greable gardoun for al opin sclaundris; thou shalt have the malisoun of Moab and Ariel; the benysoun of Bethsaida shal make thy beddis heed; and, Jakke, for thou apprisist not the curse of seint Franceis, but scornyst the malisoun of the foure ordris, take the malisoun that God ?af to brekers of his lawe, in the book of Deutronomye, the seven and twenty chapitre; but evere be ware of Cristis curse, and of cattis tailis, the which if thou have grace to cacchen, nevere shal thou thryve. Now fare forthe to thi fourmures, and, Jak, thou hem telle the matere of oure talkynge, and loke how hem likith; and if hem thinke not thi sawes sufficientli assoilid, lat hem senden a?en, it shal be amendid; and sai hem that it nedith not to sharpen oure clerkes, for frere Dawe is scharpe ynow? for al sich enditinge. Ffare wele, Jak Jawdewyne, I thee God bitake; and nomore of freris I thee rede to preche. To lower state than thei ben thou maist hem not dryve, and if thei evere come to hi?er, the wers shal thou thryve.
