      <field name="fulltext">TO THE MEMORY OF THE AUTHOR OF THE VILLAGE CURATE, &amp;c. BY A FRIEND. Sweet Bard, whose pencil could with Nature's vie, To thee shall no kind friend one tribute pay? And shall the ground, where thy cold relics lie, Be still unhallow'd by the Muse's lay? Yet not inglorious in thy coffin sleeps With thee that song, whose beauty charms the soul: Still shall the virgin, as with thee she weeps, O'er all her senses own thy soft controul. While Pity reads the tributary verse Thy hand inscrib'd upon a sister's bier, Fancy shall view the slow-proceeding hearse, And with the mourner's mix her sacred tear: Shall feel, when dust on dust is thrown, the sound Strike deep on each warm fibre of the heart, And tell with solemn voice to all around, âThat hour must come, when love from love must part.â Yet shall thy muse excite by turns to joy, And to the mind her fairer views disclose: For why should sorrow all our thoughts employ, Why waste our years in unavailing woes? With thee, sweet Bard, we tread thy village lawn, And taste each pleasure of thy rural scene; Mark with thy raptur'd eye the flecker'd dawn, When June's gay month has deck'd the world in green: And then when Evening comes, a pilgrim sad, Each livelier tint of Nature's face to shroud; While rising slow, in silver mantle clad, The moon hangs pillow'd on an eastern cloud; We hear thy nightingale her anthem raise, Amidst the stillness of thy quiet grove; While thine own organ with accordant praise Swells the loud notes of gratitude and love. Or in thy study, fill'd with ancient lore, Where learning smil'd upon thy peaceful hours, We see thee seated midst a numerous store, Culling fresh fragrance from the Muse's flowers: Or proudly marshalling thy classic bands, Where all, well rang'd, in gilded livery shine; As some great leader midst his army stands, And darts his eye along the goodly line. Oh blameless triumph! and oh blest mankind, Had the world's victors been content, like thee, The wreath of science on their brows to bind, And sought such laurels as with Peace agree! Far happier thou! of nature's charms to sing, Thine was the lot, from din of arms retir'd; To rise from earth on Contemplation's wing, By Faith, by Hope, by Charity inspir'd. 'Twas thine with Peace the rural shades to rove, To taste the bliss domestic life bestows; To feel the fondness of thy sisters' love, Their joys to heighten, and to sooth their woes. 'Twas thine with these to pass the studious day; To blend with Hurdis, Cowper's honour'd name; To charm his fancy with thy woodland lay, To share his friendship, and partake his fame. Nor didst thou wake thy heavenly harp in vain: Though cold's the hand that strung the immortal lyre, Still soft Compassion listens to the strain, And hangs enchanted o'er the trembling wire. E'en from the tomb such sweet vibrations ring, As steal from Princesses the trickling tear; So Love fraternal struck the sorrowing string, That matron Majesty bows down to hear. And oh! what jewel on a Prince's brow Shines like the drop, which Pity's grief betrays? 'Tis this that pales the ruby's living glow, And dims the brightness of the diamond's blaze. P. H. Magd. Coll. THE VILLAGE CURATE. Dum relego scripsisse pudet, quia plurima cerno, Me quoque qui feci judice, digna lini. Of Man's first disobedience, and the fruit Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste Brought death into the world, and all our woe, With loss of Edenâof the glorious year, In all her changes fair; of gentle Spring, Veil'd in a show'r of roses and perfumes, Refulgent Summer in the pride of youth, Mild Autumn with her wain and wheaten sheaf, Or sullen Winter, loud, and tyrannous; Let nobler poets sing. Sit thou apart, And on thine own Parnassus sweep the lyre, Applauded Hayley, by the Muses taught, Who in those fairy groves delight to dwell Which thy hand rear'd. And thou, superior bard, Who, pris'ner to some fair one's will, hast sung Thy Task so sweetly, strike again the strong, The bold, the various energetic chord, Secure and happy in thy fair retreat. Be mine the task to sing the man content, The Village Curate. From no foreign shore Came he a wand'ring fugitive, and, tost On angry seas to please a poet's gods, At length scarce reach'd the hospitable port. With Father Brute he boasts not to have left The tott'ring state of Priam, nor his blood Can shew by lineal catalogue so pure And only British, that no rude invader Of Danish, Saxon, or of Norman breed, Has mix'd with his god-sprung progenitors. Nor has he clomb the high and hoary tops Of Snowdon or Plinlimmon; yet in heart A truer Briton lives not; thee he loves, O happy England, and will love thee still. In yonder mansion, rear'd by rustic hands, And deck'd with no superfluous ornament, Where use was all the architect propos'd, And all the master wish'd, which, scarce a mile From village tumult, to the morning sun Turns its warm aspect, yet with blossoms hung Of cherry and of peach, lives happy still The reverend Alcanor. On a hill, Half way between the summit and a brook Which idly wanders at its foot, it stands, And looks into a valley wood-besprent, That winds along below. Beyond the brook, Where the high coppice intercepts it not, Or social elms, or with his ample waist The venerable oak, up the steep side Of yon aspiring hill full opposite, Luxuriant pasture spreads before his eye Eternal verdure; save that here and there A spot of deeper green shews where the swain Expects a nobler harvest, or high poles Mark the retreat of the scarce-budded hop, Hereafter to be eminently fair, And hide the naked staff that train'd him up With golden flow'rs. On the hill-top behold The village steeple, rising from the midst Of many a rustic edifice; 'tis all The Pastor's care. For he, ye whipping clerks, Who with a jockey's speed from morn till night Gallop amain through sermons, services, And dirty roads, and barely find the day Sufficient for your toilâhe still disdains For lucre-sake to do his work amiss, And starve the flock he undertakes to feed. Nor does he envy your ignoble ease, Ye pamper'd Priests, who only eat and sleep, And sleep and eat, and quaff the tawny juice Of vet'ran port: sleep on, and take your rest, Nor quit the downy couch preferment strews To aid your master. While Alcanor lives, Though Providence no greater meed design To crown his labour, than the scanty sum One cure affords, yet shall he not regret That he renounc'd a life so little worth To God and to his country. For he too Might still have slumber'd in an easy chair, Or idly lolled upon a sofa, held A willing captive in the magic chain Of Alma-mater; but in happy time Serious occasion cut the golden link, And set him free, to taste the nobler sweets Of life domestic. There th' apostate lives, In habitation neat, but plain and small: Look in and see, for there no treason lurks, And he who lives as in the face of Heav'n Shuns not the eye of man. On either side The door, that opens with a touch, a room, The kitchen one, and what you will the other. There now he sits in meditation lost, And to the growing page commits with speed To-morrow's text. Look round, nor fear to rouse The busy soul, which, on her work intent, Holds sense a pris'ner, and with cautious bolt Has barr'd full fast the portals of the mind, To shut out interruption. Bare the wallsâ For here no painter's happy art has taught The great progenitor to live anew Upon the smiling canvass. Sculpture here No ornament has hung of fruit or flow'r; Nor specimen is here, to shew how well The imitative style can steal the grace Which Nature lent the Painter. One poor sheet, Half almanack, half print, without a frame, Above the grate hangs unaccompanied: A kind remembrancer of time to come, Of fast and festival, expiring terms, New moon and full. A regal table here Arrests the eye, and here the brave account Of Chancellor, High Steward, and their train, Vice-Chancellor, and Proctors; awful sound, And still more awful sight to him, that treads The public street with hat and stick, or wants That grave appendage of the chin, a band. Above behold the venerable pile Some pious Founder rais'd; but stay we not To call him from his grave, where he perhaps Would gladly rest unknown, and have an ear Not to be rous'd by the Archangel's trump. Yon half-a-dozen shelves support, vast weight! The Curate's Library. There marshall'd stand Sages and heroes, modern and antique. He, their commander, like the vanquish'd fiend Out-cast of Heav'n, oft through their armed files Darts an experienc'd eye, and feels his heart Distend with pride to be their only chief. Yet needs not he the tedious muster-roll; The title page of each well-known, his name, And character. Nor scorns he to converse With raw recruit or musty veteran, And oft prefers the mutilated garb To macaroni suit, bedaub'd with gold, Which often hides the man of little worth, And tinsel properties. What need of dress So fine and gorgeous, if the soul within Be chaste and pure? The fairest mask put on Hides not the wrinkle of deformity. A soul of worth will gild a beggar's frieze, And on his tatter'd suit a lustre shed No time can change. Give to the harlot's cheek The glowing rouge, true virtue needs it not. Shed perfumes in the chambers of the sick, The lip of health has odours of its own. Now mark we, what the master most esteems, Yon antiquated thing, whose shapeless bulk Fills half his room, the name a harpsichord. In days remote the artist liv'd, whose hand First smooth'd the burnish'd surface, haply sprung From line of Jubal, whose ingenious race Taught erst the harp and organ. Thence it came, Like great Atrides' sceptre, handed down From Vulcan's smithy: to his chatterbox, The pert and nimble-finger'd Argicide, Jove gave it, he to Pelops, and so on. So when his Grace a thread-bare coat discards, He gives it to his valet, he to Tom, And Tom to Dick; then swings it for a while Under a penthouse-shade in Monmouth-street. It travels once again from back to back Of prentice, poet, pedlar, till at length, Quite out at elbows, and of buttons stript, Powder'd and greasy, to some beggar's brat It falls, a golden prize. Such the descent Alcanor's instrument may boast; but he More for its present use the thing esteems, Than could its ancient pedigree be trac'd E'en to the days of old Cadwallader. What boots it, O ye titled great, to shew The noble ancestor of regal line, Whose valour bound an enemy in chains, Or patriotic wisdom sav'd a state, To be allied to men of worth and wit, The glory of the world, if in yourselves No spark of virtue live? Who can esteem The man, who all his dignity derives From honours not his own? Give me the steed Whose noble efforts bore the prize away; I care not for his grandsire or his dam: Be thine the nag of admirable port, Which, spare and sinewless, still lags behind; I ask him not, though sprung of Galathy, Bucephalus, or Pegase. Yet I grant, Where goodness is to greatness near allied, And blood and virtue for one empire strive, The man who has them is a man indeed. Nor, trust me, is the world so worthless grown, But such there are, and such my soul esteems. That ample case, which underneath the frame Of harpsichord so smooth, in shape uncouth Reposes, from the morning broom defends A viol-bass, else long ago destroy'd By the rude blows of slattern Lalage. For she, a subtle wit, can plainly see No worth in that whose worth is far remov'd Beyond her sight and reach: so, critic-like, She sweeps away her cobweb with a frisk, And crushes many a pearl. That smaller case A violin protects, still sound and safe, Though tumbled ringing oft upon the floor With proud disdain, and ruin musical. Such is Alcanor's houshold, such his state, Save what might yet be sung in higher strains, Of broom, and stool, of table, chair, and grate, The furniture of parlour, kitchen bare, And cellar ill-bestow'd; imperial themes, And worthy meditation infinite. Save too the tedious invent'ry above, Of blanket, bed, and reverend bureau: Besides what ornaments the nest sublime Of heav'n-aspiring Lalage. A maid Is she, who sleeps in the moon's neighbourhood, And often hears the golden show'r descend Upon the tiles above, nor dreads assault From maid-deceiving Jove. Too wise were he To seek Calisto under Dian's nose. Let the fair silver-shafted Queen depart, And Jove may come to woo her in the dark; She too has beauty that demands a veil, Hide, hide her from him or she wins him not. Methinks Displeasure clouds the critic's brow, And Scorn her arrow dips, profoundly perch'd On his protruded lip. âIs this the man, âThe Poet sings, who, stranger to the world, âSuffers the speedy wick of life to burn âE'en to the socket; and, the duty done âOne church affords, the rest of life resigns âTo selfish ease? Are these the nobler sweets âOf life domestic? Was it but for this âAlcanor fled the public walks of life, âAnd bless'd the serious cause that set him free âFrom Alma-mater's chain? Nobler it were âTo mingle with the busy world, and be âThe like of others, than sit here, supine âAnd sedulous, to please himself alone. âI grant him innocent and free from blame, âBut hate the bliss which centres in itself. âGive me the man who cannot taste a joy âWhich none partakes.â A truce, impatient Sir, For such Alcanor is. Not for himself He sought the lonely cell remote, and stor'd His humble mansion with resources sweet Of intellectual bliss. To other eyes And other ears the letter'd page unfolds Ambrosial food, the honey of research. 'Tis not to please Alcanor's self alone, Or heedless Lalage, so oft is heard The melting sound of sweet-ton'd harmony. In chambers yet unsung three fairies dwell, Each to Alcanor bound, and near in blood, But nearer in affection. Julia she, Who holds the rein of houshold management, And moderates with skill the lavish hand Of hasty Lalage. Eliza next, Of aspect mild, and ever-blooming cheek; Good humour there, and innocence, and health Perennial roses shed. It is a May Which never drops its blush, but still the same Appears in Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring; Save when it glows with a superior tinge, Kiss'd by the morning breeze, or lighted up At sound of commendation well-bestow'd, Under the down-cast eye of modest worth, Which shrinks at its own praise. Unwary Belles, Who day by day the fashionable round Of dissipation tread, stealing from art The blush Eliza owns, to hide a cheek Pale and deserted, come, and learn of me How to be ever-blooming, young, and fair. Give to the mind improvement. Let the tongue Be subject to the heart and head. Withdraw From city smoke, and trip with agile foot, Oft as the day begins, the steepy down Or velvet lawn, earning the bread you eat. Rise with the lark, and with the lark to bed: The breath of night's destructive to the hue Of ev'ry flow'r that blows. Go to the field, And ask the humble daisy why it sleeps Soon as the sun departs? Why close the eyes Of blossoms infinite, long ere the moon Her oriental veil puts off? Think why, Nor let the sweetest blossom nature boasts Be thus expos'd to night's unkindly damp. Well may it droop, and all its freshness lose, Compell'd to taste the rank and pois'nous steam Of midnight theatre, and morning ball. Give to repose the solemn hour she claims, And from the forehead of the morning steal The sweet occasion. O there is a charm Which morning has, that gives the brow of age A smack of youth, and makes the lip of youth Shed perfumes exquisite. Expect it not, Ye who till noon upon a down-bed lie, Indulging fev'rous sleep, or wakeful dream Of happiness no mortal heart has felt But in the regions of romance. Ye fair, Like you it must be woo'd, or never won: And, being lost, it is in vain ye ask For milk of roses and Olympian dew. Cosmetic art no tincture can afford The faded feature to restore: no chain, Be it of gold, and strong as adamant, Can fetter beauty to the fair one's will. But leave we not the gentle Isabel Unsung, though nature on her cheek no rose Has planted, and the lily blossom there Without a rival. Look within, and learn That on the mind internal she bestows What she denies the face. Yes, she is kind, And gives to ev'ry man his proper gift, To make him needful to his native soil. There is not inequality so strange 'Twixt man and man, as haughty wits suppose. The beggar treads upon the monarch's heel For excellence, and often wears a heart Of noble temper, under filth and rags: While he that reigns, in spite of outward pomp, Is mean and beggarly within, and far outweigh'd By the offensive lazar at his gate. Th' unletter'd fool, who daily steers the plough With vacant head, and heart as unimprov'd As the dull brute he drives, gives to the world A necessary good, which all thy pains, Ingenious Critic, or thy deep research, Profound Philosopher, thy preaching, Clerk, Thy prattle, Lawyer, or thy grave demurs, Costly Physician, hardly shall exceed. The kingly tulip captivates the eye, But smelt we loath; while the sweet violet, Which little beauty boasts, hid from the sight, With such a fragrant perfume hits the sense, As makes us love ere we behold. And thus The gaudy peacock of the feather'd race The noblest seems, till the sweet note be heard Which nightly cheers the musing poet's ear Under the thorny brake; and then we grant, That little Philomel, though unadorn'd, Needs not the aid of plumes. So, Isabel, Internal worth upon thy cheek bestows A rose's beauty, though no rose be there. A heart which almost breaks to be rebuk'd, A mind inform'd, yet fearful to be seen, Kept by a tongue which never but at home, And cautious then, its golden trust betrays. These are thy charms, and they are charms for me, And in my eye as sweet a grace bestow, As matchless Beauty, trick'd in airy smiles And suit of fantasy, what time she trips With foot inaudible the sprightly round Of fairy dance, outshining ev'ry star And planet of the night. And these shall last, As morning fair and fresh as amaranth, When all thy triumphs, Beauty, are no more. Here let us pause. For learned jockeys say, 'Tis good to give one's steed a morning draught: And he that will may whet his whistle too With cordial peppermint, or baser dram, The journey scarce begun. Tedious the way, Through many a dismal lane, and darksome wood, In story famous for the murder done On nightly traveller. And ask the sot, Who daily drives the clattering stage, with face Raw as the surloin, wrapt in coat of proof, Lashing his rawbon'd steeds to distance time, Now swearing, drinking now, now snarling jokes, Now laughing loud, and now with surly heel Stamping the bootâask him, I say, if drink Be not the soul of labour. What could he, The frequent can denied, the smiling bowl, And ever-and-again-returning dram? Or ask the drunken fool, who all day long Or drinks, or lolls upon an alehouse bench, With pot in hand, and thirsty pipe in mouth. Sons of Anacreon, say whence the laugh Which shakes the very roof, at ev'ry pause Of the loud song with Stentrophonic voice Lustily brayed? Or you, ye gallant bloods, Say whence your noble exploits, to beset Fair Thais, kick the waiter, burst the lamp, Cry fire, and bid defiance to the watch? Join your shrill pipes, ye maids of Billingsgate, And market dames, and make the chorus full. âO, there is nothing noble to be done âTill we have swallow'd pint on pint. 'Tis drink, âAnd only drink, that makes the world go round.â I praise you not; and if there be a wretch Who thus far has perus'd my careless page, In hope to find a palliative to vice, Here let us part. An enemy to mirth Who deems me, does me wrong. I hold it good To laugh away a portion of my days, And give to mirth her song, to sport her feather: But he who draws his wit to stab at truth, And is the friend of folly when he smiles, Has liv'd too long. Ne'er be my trifling muse Virtue's assassin, or the friend of vice. Kind Heaven, if there be a deed so dark Yet lodg'd in future time, be death my lot Ere it arrive, and send me to my grave E'en in the pride and glory of my strength. Ye gentle Pow'rs, (if any such there be, And, if there be not, 'tis a sweet mistake To think there be) that day by day, unseen, Where souls, unanimous and link'd in love, In sober converse spend the vacant hour, Hover above, and in the cup of life A cordial pour which all its bitter drowns, And gives the hasty minutes as they pass Unwonted fragrance; come and aid my song. In that clear fountain of eternal love Which flows for ay at the right hand of him, The great Incomprehensible ye serve, Dip my advent'rous pen, that nothing vile, Of the chaste eye or ear unworthy, may In this my early song be seen or heard. Sing then, my Muse, the rural Curate's steps, His modes of living, manners, and pursuits. One year the limits of thy song confine, From early spring till spring again return. Then let the bard begin, when Winter yet Powders the lawn with snow, and on our eaves Hangs the chaste icicle. Be that the time, When the tir'd sportsman lays his gun aside, Nor wages ineffectual war again On partridge race. The day St. Valentine, When maids are brisk, and at the break of day Start up, and turn their pillows, curious all To know what happy swain the fates provide A mate for life. Then follows thick discharge Of true-love knots and sonnets nicely penn'd; But, to the learned critic's eye, no verse, But prose distracted, galloping away Like yelping cur with kettle at his tail. Forgive the thought, ye maids of poesy, And be as kind as fair. Critics may laugh And yet approve; and I your pains applaud, Though short of excellence. I love the maid Who has ambition, and betrays a mind Of active and ingenious turn; who scorns Only to know what fashion and the age Require, and can do more than flirt her fan, Read novels, dance with grace, sing playhouse airs, Speak scandal, daub or vellum or her face, Retail some half-a-dozen terms in French, And twice as many English, and dispatch By every post a tedious manuscript, Which to translate would crack the very brain Of Arabic Professor. O ye fair, Ye were design'd for nobler flights than these; Nature on you as well as us bestow'd The good capacity. And though to us She gave the nicer judgment, yet she hid The sweet defect in you, with better skill To clothe the fair idea, keener eye, And quicker apprehension. 'Tis in you Imagination glows in all her strength, Gay as the robe of spring, and we delight To see you pluck her blossoms, and compose The cheerful nosegay for the swain you love. What if Alcanor's self should not disdain To imitate your toils, but sometimes hang Ill-woven chaplets on Maria's brow, Which needs no ornament to make it please With sweeter grace. The hour so spent shall live, Not unapplauded, in the book of Heav'n. For dear and precious as the moments are Permitted man, they are not all for deeds Of active virtue. Give we none to vice, And Heav'n will not strict reparation ask For many a summer's day and winter's eve So spent as best amuses us. Alas! If He that made us were extreme to mark The trifled hour, what human soul could live? We trifle all, and he who best deserves Is but a trifler. What art thou whose eye Follows my pen, or what am I that write? Both triflers. 'Tis a trifling world, from him Who banquets daintily in sleeves of lawn, To him who starves upon a country cure: From him who is the pilot of a state, To him who begs, and rather begs than works. Then blame we not Alcanor for his pains, Nor think him misemploy'd, what time he sits Eager to clothe the new-born thought, and wooes The maiden Meditation, hard to win, For terms of apt significance. Nor then, When Winter, better pleas'd, puts on a smile, And round his garden at high noon he walks, Not unattended, and the daffodil And early snowdrop welcomes, pensive flow'r. Nor needs he then excuse, what time he starts, To mark the progress of the morning sun, As northward from his equinox he steers, And once again brings on the glorious year. Sweet are the graces which the steps attend Of early morning, when, the clouded brow Of winter smooth'd, up from her orient couch She springs, and, like a maid betroth'd, puts on Her bridal suit, and with an ardent smile Comes forth to greet her lover. To my eye, As well as thine, Alcanor, grateful 'tis, Ay passing sweet, to mark the cautious pace Of slow-returning Spring, e'en from the time When first the matted apricot unfolds His tender bloom, till the full orchard glows; From when the gooseberry first shews a leaf, Till the high wood is clad, and the broad oak Yields to the fly-stung ox a shade at noon Sun proof. How charming 'tis, to see sweet May Laugh in the rear of Winter, and put on Her gay apparel to begin anew The wanton year. See where apace she comes As fair, as young, as brisk, as when from Heav'n Before the Founder of the world she tripp'd To Paradise rejoicing: the light breeze Wafts to the sense a thousand odours; Hark! The cheerful music which attends. O Man, Would on thyself alone the awful doom Of death had past! It grieves me to the soul To think how soon the blooming year shall fade, How soon the leafy honours of the vale Be shed, the blossom nipt, and the bare branch Howl dreary music in the ear of Winter. Yet let us live, and, while we may, rejoice, And not our present joy disturb with thought Of evils sure to come, and by no art Be shunn'd. Come hither, fool, who vainly think'st Thine only is the art to plumb the depth Of truth and wisdom. 'Tis a friend who calls, And has some honest pity left for thee, O thoughtless stubborn Sceptic. Look abroad, And tell me, shall we to blind chance ascribe The scene so wonderful, so fair, and good? Shall we no farther search than sense will lead, To find the glorious cause which so delights The eye and ear, and scatters ev'ry where Ambrosial perfumes? Is there not a hand Which operates unseen, and regulates The vast machine we tread on? Yes, there is Who first created the great world, a work Of deep construction, complicately wrought, Wheel within wheel; though all in vain we strive To trace remote effects through the thick maze Of movements intricate, confus'd and strange, Up to the great Artificer who made And guides the whole. What if we see him not? No more can we behold the busy soul Which animates ourselves. Man to himself Is all a miracle. I cannot see The latent cause, yet such I know there is, Which gives the body motion, nor can tell By what strange impulse the so ready limb Performs the purposes of will. How then Shalt thou or I, who cannot span ourselves, In this our narrow vessel comprehend The being of a God. Go to the shore, Cast in thy slender angle, and draw out The huge Leviathan. Compress the deep, And shut it up within the hollow round Of the small hazel-nut: or freight the shell Of snail or cockle with the glorious sun, And all the worlds that live upon his beams, The goodly apparatus that rides round The glowing axle-tree of Heav'n. Then come, And I will grant 'tis thine to scale the height Of wisdom infinite, and comprehend Secrets incomprehensible; to know There is no God, and what the potent cause Which the revolving universe upholds, And not requires a Deity at hand. Persuade me not, insulting disputant, That I shall die, the wick of life consum'd, And, spite of all my hopes, sink to the grave, Never to rise again. Will the great God, Who thus by annual miracle restores The perish'd year, and youth and beauty gives By resurrection strange, where none was ask'd, Leave only man to be the scorn of time And sport of death? Shall only he one spring, One hasty summer, and one autumn see, And then to winter irredeemable Be doom'd, cast out, rejected, and despis'd? Tell me not so, or by thyself enjoy The melancholy thought. Am I deceiv'd? Be my mistake eternal. If I err, It is an error sweet and lucrative. For should not Heav'n a farther course intend Than the short race of life, I am at least Thrice happier than thou, ill-boding fool, Who striv'st in vain the awful doom to fly Which I not fear. But I shall live again, And still on that sweet hope shall my soul feed. A medicine it is, which with a touch Heals all the pains of life; a precious balm, Which makes the tooth of sorrow venomless, And of her hornet sting so keen disarms Cruel Adversityâ A truce to thought, And come, Alcanor, Julia, Isabel, Eliza come, and let us o'er the fields, Across the down, or through the shelving wood, Wind our uncertain way. Let fancy lead, And be it ours to follow, and admire, As well we may, the graces infinite Of nature. Lay aside the sweet resource Which winter needs, and may at will obtain, Of authors chaste and good, and let us read The living page, whose ev'ry character Delights and gives us wisdom. Not a tree, A plant, a leaf, a blossom, but contains A folio volume. We may read, and read, And read again, and still find something new, Something to please, and something to instruct. E'en in the noisome weed. See, ere we pass Alcanor's threshold, to the curious eye A little monitor presents her page Of choice instruction, with her snowy bells The lily of the vale. She nor affects The public walk, nor gaze of mid-day sun. She to no state or dignity aspires, But silent and alone puts on her suit, And sheds her lasting perfume, but for which We had not known there was a thing so sweet Hid in the gloomy shade. So when the blast Her sister tribes confounds, and to the earth Stoops their high heads that vainly were expos'd, She feels it not, but flourishes anew, Still shelter'd and secure. And so the storm, That makes the high elm couch, and rends the oak, The humble lily spares. A thousand blows, Which shake the lofty monarch on his throne, We lesser folk feel not. Keen are the pains Advancement often brings. To be secure, Be humble; to be happy, be content. All is not gold, Eliza, which the eye Delights in. To command a coach and six, Be styl'd my Lady, or your Grace, to lead In fashion, shine at court, be cloth'd in silk, And make an artificial day, beset With eye-distressing jewels, are but charms Which lift you from the crowd, to be the mock Of hissing envy; steps they are, that lead Unwary maids to fortune's pillory, To be the butt of undeserv'd reproach And lying slander. Hast thou not observ'd The idle school-boy, through a field of wheat Scarce ripe, returning home, with what delight He trims a switch, and strikes at the full ear Most eminent, and still walks on and strikes? So Fortune gambols with the great, and still, As one above another climbs, condemns, And makes him shorter by the head. Well-pleas'd, No doubt, Alcanor's self were, should by chance An eddy seize him in the stream of life, And bear him to a throne, of all this isle Grand Metropolitan: but trust me, Sir, Nor Laud nor Tillotson would stoop again To bear the golden burden. But with him Sweet peace abounds, and only he escapes The poison'd shafts of obloquy and wrong, Who hides his virtue in content; and, like This modest lily, wins our best regard By studying to avoid it. Virtue too Will ever thus her lone retreat betray, And, spite of privacy, be sought and seen; For she has fragrance, which delights the sense Of men and angels, yea, of God himself.â Away, we loiter. Without notice pass The sleepy crocus, and the staring daisy The courtier of the sun. What find we there? The love-sick cowslip, which her head inclines To hide a bleeding heart. And here's the meek And soft-ey'd primrose. Dandelion this, A college youth who flashes for a day All gold; anon he doffs his gaudy suit, Touch'd by the magic hand of some grave Bishop. And all at once, by commutation strange, Becomes a Reverend Divine. How sleek! How full of grace! and in that globous wig, So nicely trimm'd, unfathomable stores, No doubt, of erudition most profound. Each hair is learned, and his awful phiz, A well-drawn title-page, gives large account Of matters strangely complicate within. Place the two doctors each by each, my friends, Which is the better? say. I blame not you, Ye powder'd periwigs, which hardly hide, With glossy suit and well-fed paunch to boot, The understanding lean and beggarly. But let me tell you, in the pompous globe, Which rounds the dandelion's head, is couch'd Divinity most rare. I never pass But he instructs me with a still discourse, That more persuades than all the vacant noise Of pulpit rhetoric; for vacant 'tis, And vacant must it be, by vacant heads Supported. Leave we them to mend, and mark The melancholy hyacinth, that weeps All night, and never lifts an eye all day. How gay this meadow!âlike a gamesome boy New cloth'd, his locks fresh comb'd and powder'd, he All health and spirits. Scarce so many stars Shine in the azure canopy of heav'n, As king-cups here are scatter'd, interspers'd With silver daisies. See, the toiling hind With many a sturdy stroke cuts up at last The tough and sinewy furze. How hard he fought To fell the glory of the barren waste! For what more noble than the vernal furze With golden baskets hung? Approach it not, For ev'ry blossom has a troop of swords Drawn to defend it. 'Tis the treasury Of Fays and Fairies. Here they nightly meet, Each with a burnish'd king-cup in his hand, And quaff the subtil ether. Here they dance Or to the village chimes, or moody song Of midnight Philomel. The ringlet see Fantastically trod. There Oberon His gallant train leads out, the while his torch The glow-worm lights, and dusky night illumes: And there they foot it featly round, and laugh. The sacred spot the superstitious ewe Regards, and bites it not in reverence. Anon the drowsy clock tolls oneâthe cock His clarion sounds, the dance breaks off, the lights Are quench'd, the music hush'd, they speed away Swifter than thought, and still the break of morn Outrun, and chasing midnight as she flies Pursue her round the globe. So Fancy weaves Her flimsy web, while sober Reason sits, And smiling wonders at the puny work, A net for her; then springs on eagle wing, Constraint defies, and soars above the sun. Not always such her flight. For croaking dames And silly mothers oft conspire to clip Her infant wing, and feed her full with fears, Till all her energy expires, and she, Caught in the snare of fancy, lives and quakes Pris'ner for life. O thoughtless managers! See where the sky-blue periwinkle climbs E'en to the cottage eaves, and hides the loam And dairy lattice with a thousand eyes, Pentagonally form'd, to mock the skill Of proud geometers. See there the fern Unclenching all her fingers, to distract The plodding theorist, who little sees, And tortures reason for the rest. Behold, And trust him not, the seed. So errors live, Truth dies, and ev'ry day we need a Brown To set a jangling world to rights. No more: But mark with how peculiar grace yon wood, That clothes the weary steep, waves in the breeze Her sea of leaves: thither we turn our steps, And as we pass attend the cheerful sound Of woodland harmony, which ever fills The merry vale between. How sweet the song Day's harbinger performs! I have not heard Such elegant divisions drawn from art. And what is he that wins our admiration? A little speck which floats upon the sun-beam. What vast perfection cannot nature crowd Into a puny point! The nightingale, Her solo anthem sung, and all who heard Content, joins in the chorus of the day. She, gentle heart, thinks it no pain to please, Nor, like the moody songsters of the world, Displays her talent, pleases, takes affront, And locks it up in envy. Now we hear The golden wood-pecker, who like the fool Laughs loud at nothing. Now the restless pye: So, pert and garrulous, from morn to night The scandal-monger prates, and frankly tells The secret springs which actuate the state, The minister, the people. She can see, With easy eye, who stands, who falls, who rises; Who little merits, and who best deserves; And thus she murders truth, and propagates The public lie, extorting many a tear And many a sigh from wounded innocence. Yes, Isabel, if ev'ry idle word Have awful weight in heav'n, no feeble deed Will turn the scale in favour of that fool, Who prattles injury, and worth defames, From gay fifteen to tremulous fourscore! Hark, how the cuckoo mocks the village bells. The jay attend, a very termagant. Observe the glossy raven in the grass Croaking rude courtship to his negro mate. Yes, he's a flatterer, and in his song, If such it may be call'd, her charms recites. He tells her of her bosom black as jet, Her taper leg, her penetrating eye, Her shapely beak, her soft and silky wing, Her voice melodiousâwaddles courteous round, Vows to be constant, prays humane returnâ Solicitous in vain he claps his wing And flies; she much against her will pursues. I love to see the little goldfinch pluck The groundsel's feather'd seed, and twit and twit, And soon in bower of apple blossoms perch'd, Trim his gay suit, and pay us with a song. I would not hold him pris'ner for the world. The chimney-haunting swallow too, my eye And ear well pleases. I delight to see How suddenly he skims the glassy pool, How quaintly dips, and with a bullet's speed Whisks by. I love to be awake, and hear His morning song twitter'd to dawning day. But most of all it wins my admiration, To view the structure of this little work, A bird's nest. Mark it well, within, without. No tool had he that wrought, no knife to cut, No nail to fix, no bodkin to insert, No glue to join; his little beak was all. And yet how neatly finish'd! What nice hand, With ev'ry implement and means of art, And twenty years apprenticeship to boot, Could make me such another? Fondly then We boast of excellence, whose noblest skill Instinctive genius foils. The bee observe; She too an artist is, and laughs at man, Who calls on rules the sightly hexagon With truth to form; a cunning architect, Who at the roof begins her golden work, And builds without foundation. How she toils, And still from bud to bud, from flow'r to flow'r, Travels the livelong day. Ye idle drones, Who rather pilfer than your bread obtain By honest means like these, behold and learn How good, how fair, how honourable 'tis To live by industry. The busy tribes Of bees so emulous are daily fed With heaven's peculiar manna. 'Tis for them, Unwearied alchymists, the blooming world Nectareous gold distils. And bounteous heav'n, Still to the diligent and active good, Their very labour makes the certain cause Of future wealth. The little traveller, Who toils so cheerfully from flow'r to flow'r, For ever singing as she goes, herself Bears on her wings and thighs the genial dust The barren blossom needs, and the young seed Impregnates for herself, else unprolific. How peaceable and solemn a retreat This wood affords! I love to quit the glare Of sultry day for shadows cool as these: The sober twilight of this winding way Lets fall a serious gloom upon the mind, Which checks, but not appals. Such is the haunt Religion loves, a meek and humble maid, Whose tender eye bears not the blaze of day. And here with Meditation hand in hand She walks, and feels her often-wounded heart Renew'd and heal'd. Speak softly. We presume A whisper is too loud for solitude So mute and still. So have I gone at night, When the faint eye of day was hardly clos'd, And turn'd the grating key which kept the door Of church or chapel, to enjoy alone The mournful horrors, which impending night And painted windows shed along the dark And scarce to be distinguish'd aisle. My foot Has stood and paus'd, half startled at the sound Of its own tip-toe pace. I've held my breath, And been offended that my nimble heart Should throb so audibly. I would not hear Aught else disturb the silent reign of death, Save the dull ticking of a lazy clock. That calls me home, and leads the pious soul Through mazes of reflection, till she feels For whom and why she lives. Ye timid fair, I never saw the sheeted ghost steal by, I never heard th' unprison'd dead complain And gibber in my ear, though I have lov'd The yawning time of night, and travell'd round And round again the mansions of the dead. Yet have I heard, what fancy well might deem Sufficient proof of both, the prowling owl Sweep by, and with a hideous shriek awake The church-yard echo, and I too have stood Harrow'd and speechless at the dismal sound. But here she frays us not. Such scenes as these No ghost frequents. If any spirits here, They are as gentle as the eve of day, And only come to turn our wand'ring steps From lurking danger. With what easy grace This footway winds about! Shew me designs That please us more. What strict geometer Can carve his yew, his quickset, or his box, To half its elegance? I would not see A thousand paces forward, nor be led Through mazes ever serpentine. Let art Be hid in nature. Wind the flow'ry path, But be not bound to follow Hogarth's line. I grant it beauty; but, too often seen, That beauty pleases not. I love to meet A sudden turn like this, which stops me short, Extravagantly devious, and invites Or up the hill or down; then winds again, By reeling drunkard trod, and sudden ends In a green swarded wain-way, not unlike Cathedral aisle completely roof'd with boughs, Which stretching up-hill through the gloomy wood Displays at either end a giant door Wide open'd. Travel not the steep, nor tread With hardly sensible advance the hill Which baffles expedition. Gaze awhile At the still view below, the living scene Inimitable nature has hung up At the vault's end, then disappear again, And follow still the flexile path, conceal'd In shady underwood. Nor sometimes scorn Under the high majestic oak to sit, And comment on his leaf, his branch, his arm Paternally extended, his vast girth, And ample hoop above. To him who loves To walk with contemplation, ev'ry leaf Affords a tale concluding with a moral. The very hazel has a tongue to teach, The birch, the maple, horn-beam, beech, and ash. But these detain us not, for the faint sun Puts on a milder countenance, and skirts The undulated clouds that cross his way With soften'd glory. His warm axle cools, And his broad disc, tho' fervent, not intense, Foretells the near approach of matron night. Ye fair, retreat. Your drooping flow'rs will need Kind nutriment. Along the hedge-row path Hasten we homeward. Only pause our speed To gaze a moment at the custom'd brow, Which ever unexpectedly displays The clear cerulean prospect of the vale. Dispers'd along the bottom flocks and herds, Hayricks and cottages, beside a stream Which silverly meanders here and there; Above the brook, corn-fields, and pastures, hops, And waving woods, and tufts, and lonely oaks, Thick interspers'd as Nature best was pleas'd. I could not pass this view, nor stay to feast, For all the wealth of Ind. Ingenious painter, Why leave a land so delicately cloth'd, To gather beauties on a foreign shore? 'Twas here my Shakespear caught his living art, And who can paint like him? To British eyes Shew British beauties. Who can choose but love? Paint me the fair ones of my native isle; Your canvass shall have charms no time can kill. The foreign belle, though fair, attracts me not. Another moment pause, and to the vale, From the calm precipice we tread, look back. See where the school-boy, once again dismiss'd, Feels all the bliss of liberty, and drives The speedy hour away at the brisk game Of social cricket. It delights me much To see him run, and hear the cheerful shout Sent up for victory. I cannot tell What rare effect the mingled sound may yield Of huntsmen, hounds, and horns, to firmer hearts, Which never feel a pain for flying puss; To me it gives a pleasure far more sweet, To hear the cry of infant jubilee Exulting thus. Here all is innocent, And free from pain, which the resounding chase, With its gigantic clamours cannot drown, E'en though it pour along a thund'ring peal, Strong as the deep artillery of heav'n. Now turn, and from the pleasant summit view Alcanor's cell. Before, the garden see Well shorn and spruce; behind, the neat domain Of cow and truant poney, who approves All pastures but his own. Seen from afar, It seems, methinks, a party-colour'd spot Upon a sampler little Miss has work'd To please her grandam. Love it still, ye fair; Enjoy it still, Alcanor. Here who will May live in satisfaction truly sweet, Which York or Lambeth cannot give. Who strays, Shall taste a thousand pains unfelt at home. We fondly think the land of happiness Is any where but here. And thus we quit The little bliss we own for less, and learn From painful circumstance, the more we stray, The more we want relief. The troubled heart Which harbours discontent, feeds a disease No change of place, no medicine can cure. Happy the man who truly loves his home, And never wanders farther from his door Than we have stray'd to-day; who feels his heart Still drawing homeward, and delights, like us, Once more to rest his foot on his own threshold. Alcanor, Julia, Isabel, Eliza, Here let us pause, and ere still night advance To shut the books of heav'n, look back and see What commendable act has sprung to-day. Ah! who can boast? The little good we do In all the years of life will scarce outweigh The follies of an hour. Adieu, ye fair; We leave you to your task, nor give you aid As wont. Rear'd by your hands alone, the flow'r Shall have a ruddier blush, a sweeter fragrance. Alcanor, come, and let us once again Descend into the valley, and enjoy The sober peace of the still summer's eve. We have no blush to lose; our freckled cheek The sun not blisters, nor the night-dew blasts. Such is the time the musing poet loves. Now vigorous imagination teems, And, warm with meditation, brings to birth Her admirable thought. I love to hear The silent rook to the high wood make way With rustling wing; to mark the wanton mouse, And see him gambol round the primrose head, Till the still owl comes smoothly sailing forth, And with a shrill to-whit breaks off his dance, And sends him scouring home; to hear the cur Of the night-loving partridge, or the swell Of the deep curfew from afar. And now It pleases me to mark the hooting owl Perch'd on the naked hop-pole, to attend The distant cataract, or farmer's cur, That bays the northern lights or rising moon. And now I steal along the woody lane, To hear thy song so various, gentle bird, Sweet queen of night, transporting Philomel. I name thee not to give my feeble line A grace else wanted, for I love thy song, And often have I stood to hear it sung, When the clear moon, with Cytherean smile Emerging from an eastern cloud, has shot A look of pure benevolence and joy Into the heart of night. Yes, I have stood And mark'd thy varied note, and frequent pause, Thy brisk and melancholy mood, with soul Sincerely pleas'd. And O, methought, no note Can equal thine, sweet bird, of all that sing How easily the chief! Yet have I heard What pleases me still moreâthe human voice In serious sweetness flowing from the heart Of unaffected woman. I could hark Till the round world dissolv'd, to the pure strain Love teaches, gentle Modesty inspires. But teaze me not, ye self-conceited fools, Who with a loud insufferable squall Insult our ears, or hum a noiseless air Disdaining to be heard; the while ye smile, To shew a set of teeth newly repair'd, Or shrink and shrug, to make the crowd admire Your strange grimaces practis'd at the glass. O, I abhor it. I would rather hear A pedlar's kit scrape to a dancing dog. Melodious bird, good night; good night, Alcanor. Let us not borrow from the hours of rest, For we must steal from morning to repay. And who would lose the animated smile Of dawning day, for th' austere frown of night? I grant her well accoutred in her suit Of dripping sable, powder'd thick with stars, And much applaud her as she passes by With a replenish'd horn on either brow; But more I love to see awaking day Rise with a fluster'd cheek; a careful maid, Who fears she has outslept the custom'd hour, And leaves her chamber blushing. Hence to rest; I will not prattle longer to detain you Under the dewy canopy of night. So have I sung Alcanor and the fair, Through the slow walk and long beloiter'd day Of early summer. Let him read who will; And blame me not, if tardy as the snail I hardly creep a single mile from home. It is my humour. Let him speed who will, And fly like cannon-shot from post to post; I love to pause, and quit the public road, To gain a summit, take a view, or pluck An unknown blossom. What if I dismount, And leave my steed to graze the while I sit Under the pleasant lee, or idly roam Across the pasture, diligent to mark What passes next? 'Tis English blood that flows Under the azure covert of these veins. I love my liberty; and if I sing, Will sing to please myself, bound by no rule, The subject of no law.âI cannot think Praise-worthy excellence is only hit By servile imitation. In a path Peculiarly his own great Handel went, And justly merits our applause, though not The Homer of his art. In a new course Went Shakespear, nobly launching forth; And who shall say he has not found perfection, Though not a Sophocles? Ye shallow wits, Who bid us coast it in the learned track, Nor quit the sight of shore, there is in art A world unknown, whose treasures only he Shall spy, and well deserve, who proudly scorns The second laurel, and exulting steers Far from the custom'd way. My slender bark Perchance has rush'd into a boist'rous sea, Which soon shall overwhelm her: yet I fear No storms the furious elements can rouse, And if I fail, shall deem it noble still To founder in a brave attempt. Once more The cheerful breeze invites; I fill my sail, And scud before it. When the critic starts, And angrily unties his bags of wind, Then I lay to, and bid the blast go by. At once we rush into the midst of June, And find Alcanor at the noon of day Laborious in his garden. The warm sun Is clouded, and the fluctuating breeze Calls him from nicer labour, to attend The vegetable progress. Mark we now A thousand great effects which spring from toil, Unsung before. The martial pea observe, In column square arrang'd, line after line Successive; the gay bean, her hindmost ranks Stript of their blossoms; the thick-scatter'd bed Of soporific lettuce; the green hill Cover'd with cucumbers. All these my Muse Disdains not. She can stray well-pleas'd, and pluck The od'rous leaf of marj'ram, balm, or mint; Then smile to think how near the neighbourhood Of rue and wormwood, in her thoughtful eye Resembling life, which ever thus brings forth In quick succession bitter things and sweet. Nor scorns she to observe the thriving sage, Which well becomes the garden of a clerk; The wholesome camomile, and fragrant thyme. All these thy pains, Alcanor, propagate, Support, and feed. Let the big Doctor laugh, Who only toils to satisfy the calls Of appetite insatiate, and retires, Good honest soul, offended at the world, In pure devotion, to his pipe and bowl, And whiffs and sleeps his idle hours away. Yes, let him laugh. A life of labour yields Sweeter enjoyment than his gouty limbs Have sense to feel. It gives the body health, Agility, and strength, and makes it proof Against the fang of pain. It stays the course Of prodigal contagion, scares away The scythe of time, and turns the dart of death: And hence the mind unwonted force derives; Recruited oft by labour, to her work Strong as a giant she returns, and rolls Her SisyphÃ¦an ball with wond'rous ease Up to the mountain's top. It is the soul Of poesy and wit. Then follow still The happy task, nor scorn to feel, Alcanor, How passing grateful 'tis to reap the fruits Of willing toil. The board of industry, By her own labour frugally supply'd, Gives to her food an admirable zest, Unknown to indolence, which half asleep With palateless indifference surveys The smoaking feast of plenty. I have stray'd Wild as the mountain bee, and cull'd a sweet From ev'ry flow'r that beautify'd my way. Now shall my serious Muse with solemn tone Begin her friendly lecture to the fair. Unwedded maiden, is there yet a man For wisdom eminent? seek him betimes. He will not shun thee, though thy frequent foot Wear out the pavement at his door. Ye fair, Be sedulous to win the man of sense; And fly the empty fool. Shame the dull boy, Who leaves at college what he learn'd at school, And whips his academic hours away, Cas'd in unwrinkled buckskin and tight boots, More studious of his hunter than his books. O! had ye sense to see what powder'd apes Ye oft admire, the idle boy for shame Would lay his racket and his mace aside, And love his tutor and his desk. Time was When ev'ry woman was a judge of arms And military exploit: 'twas an age Of admirable heroes. And time was When women dealt in Hebrew, Latin, Greek; No dunces then, but all were deeply learn'd. I do not wish to see the female eye Waste all its lustre at the midnight lamp; I do not wish to see the female cheek Grow pale with application. Let your care Be to preserve your beauty; that secur'd, Improve the judgment, that the loving fair May have an eye to know the man of worth, And keep secure the jewel of her charms From him who ill deserves. Let the spruce beau, That lean, sweet-scented, and palav'rous fool, Who talks of honour and his sword, and plucks The man who dares advise him by the nose; That puny thing which hardly crawls about, Reduc'd by wine and women, yet drinks on, And vapours loudly o'er his glass, resolv'd To tell a tale of nothing, and outswear The northern tempest; let that fool, I say, Look for a wife in vain, and live despis'd. I would that all the fair ones of this isle Were such as one I knew. Peace to her soul, She lives no more. And I a genius need To paint her as she was. Most like, methinks, That amiable maid the poet drew With angel pencil, and baptiz'd her Portia. Happy the man, and happy sure he was, So wedded. Bless'd with her, he wander'd not To seek for happiness; 'twas his at home. How often have I chain'd my truant tongue, To hear the music of her sober words! How often have I wonder'd at the grace Instruction borrow'd from her eye and cheek! Surely that maid deserves a monarch's love, Who bears such rich resources in herself For her sweet progeny. A mother taught Entails a blessing on her infant charge Better than riches; an unfailing cruse She leaves behind her, which the faster flows The more 'tis drawn; where ev'ry soul may feed, And nought diminish of the public stock. Shew me a maid so fair in all your ranks, Ye crowded boarding-schools. Are ye not apt To taint the infant mind, to point the way To fashionable folly, strew with flow'rs The path of vice, and teach the wayward child Extravagance and pride? Who learns in you To be the prudent wife, or pious mother? To be her parents' staff, or husband's joy? 'Tis you dissolve the links that once held fast Domestic happiness. 'Tis you untie The matrimonial knot. 'Tis you divide The parent and his child. Yes, 'tis to you We owe the ruin of our dearest bliss. The best instructress for the growing lass Is she that bare her. Let her first be taught, And we shall see the path of virtue smooth With often treading. She can best dispense That frequent medicine the soul requires, And make it grateful to the tongue of youth, By mixture of affection. She can charm When others fail, and leave the work undone. She will not faint, for she instructs her own. She will not torture, for she feels herself. So education thrives, and the sweet maid Improves in beauty, like the shapeless rock Under the sculptor's chisel, till at length She undertakes her progress through the world, A woman fair and good, as child for parent, Parent for child, or man for wife could wish. Say, man, what more delights thee than the fair? What should we not be patient to endure, If they command? We rule the noisy world, But they rule us. Then teach them how to guide, And hold the rein with judgment. Their applause May once again restore the quiet reign Of virtue, love, and peace, and yet bring back The blush of folly, and the shame of vice. My lecture ceasesâOnce again observe Alcanor in his garden; not alone, For Isabel is there. The day declines, And now the falling sun offends them not. She rears the fainting flow'r, and feeds its root. Ye botanists, I cannot talk like you, And give to ev'ry plant its name and rank, Taught by LinnÃ©; yet I perceive in all Or known or unknown, in the garden rais'd, Or nurtur'd in the hedge-row or the field, A secret something which delights my eye, And meliorates my heart. And much I love To see the fair one bind the straggling pink, Cheer the sweet rose, the lupin, and the stock, And lend a staff to the still gadding pea. I cannot count the number of the stars, Nor call them by their names, much less relate What vegetable tribes Alcanor loves, The fair ones rear. I will not swell my song, Like you, ye bards of EpopÅÃ¯an fame, With the proud list of forces led from Greece, Or angels tumbled headlong into hell. Yet let me praise the garden-loving maid, Who innocently thus concludes the day. Ye fair, it well becomes you. Better thus Cheat time away, than at the crowded rout, Rustling in silk, in a small room close-pent, And heated e'en to fusion; made to breathe Fetid, contagious air, and fret at whist, Or sit aside to sneer and whisper scandal. In such a silent, cool, and wholesome hour, The Author of the world from heaven came To walk in Paradise, well pleas'd to mark The harmless deeds of new-created man. And sure the silent, cool, and wholesome hour May still delight him, our atonement made. Who knows but as we walk he walks unseen, And sees, and well approves the cheerful task The fair one loves. He breathes upon the pink, And gives it odour; touches the sweet rose, And makes it glow; beckons the evening dew, And sheds it on the lupin and the pea: Then smiles on her, and beautifies her cheek With gay good humour, happiness, and health. So all are passing sweet, and the young Eve Feels all her pains rewarded, all her joys Perfect and unimpair'd. But who can love, Of heav'nly temper, to frequent your walks, Ye fashion-loving belles? The human soul Your pestilent amusements hates; how then Shall he approve, who cannot look on guilt? So day by day Alcanor and the fair Attend the garden studious, soon as eve Her cooling odours sheds, and the large sun Grows dim, and shoots his mellow rays oblique. Nor these the only pleasures summer yields. They often wander at the close of day Along the shady lane, or through the wood, To pluck the ruddy strawberry, or smell The perfum'd breeze that all the fragrance steals Of honeysuckle, blossom'd beans, or clover; Or haply rifles from the new-made rick The hay's sweet odour, or the sweeter breath Of farmer's yard, where the still patient cow Stands o'er the plenteous milk-pail ruminant. Sometimes they stray at highest noon, when day His garish eye has veil'd, and idly range The new-mown pasture, mark the distant forge Deep in the valley, jutting its low roof Against the stream, close by the trickling sluice, And thither turn their steps. I love to see How hardly some their frugal morsel earn; It gives my own a zest, and serves to damp The longing appetite of discontent. See, pale and hollow-eyed, in his blue shirt, Before the scorching furnace, reeking stands The weary smith. A thund'ring water-wheel Alternately uplifts his cumbrous pair Of roaring bellows. He torments the coal, And stirs the melting ore, till all resolv'd; Then with vast forceps seizes the bright mass, And drags it glowing to the anvil. Eye Can scarce attend it, so intense the heat. He bears it all, and with one arm lets free Th' impatient stream. The heavy wheel uplifts Slowly, and suddenly lets fall, the loud And awful hammer, that confounds the ear, And makes the firm earth tremble. He the block Shapes, to the blow obsequious; cooler grown, He stays his floodgate, once again provokes The dying cinder, and his half-done work Buries in fire. Again he plucks it forth, And once more lifts it to the sturdy anvil. There beaten long, and often turn'd, at length 'Tis done. He bears it hissing to the light, An iron bar. Behold it well. What is't, But a just emblem of the lot of virtue? For in this naughty world she cannot live, Nor rust contract, nor mingle with alloy. So the great Judge, to make her worthy heav'n, Submits her to the furnace and the anvil; Till molten, bruis'd, and batter'd, she becomes Spotless and pure, and leaves her dross behind. Who can repine and think his lot severe, Who well considers this? The slaving smith, That wipes his flowing brow so fast, his bread Earns at the bitter cost, expence of health. In summer's hottest day he feeds his forge, And stands expos'd to the distressful fire, That almost broils him dead. Yet what complaint Makes he at fortune? He is well content To toil at his infernal work, and breathe A torrid atmosphere, to earn at best Scanty subsistence in this pinching world. Ye idle rich, consider this, nor aim At places, pensions, titles, coronets. Ye lazy clerks, consider this, nor sue For benefices, canonries, and mitres. All might inherit ease, would they not long To fill a braver office, and at times Look down, and see how hard the drudging poor Toils for a bare subsistence. Be content, And happiness shall turn and follow you. But she is coy as the unwedded maid, And he that follows her is vex'd in vain, And may pursue for ever. Let her fly; Shy fool, I follow not. If thou relent, Feast at my board, and be a welcome guest. So summer glides along, and happy he Who, like Alcanor, holds occasion fast, And, duty done, enjoys the summer lounge. So have I wander'd ere those days were past Which childhood calls her own. Ah! happy days, Days recollection loves, unstain'd with vice, Why were ye gone so soon? Did I not joy To quit my desk, and ramble in the field, To gather austere berries from the bush, Or search the coppice for the clust'ring nut? Did I not always with a shout applaud The voice that welcome holiday announc'd? Say, you that knew me, you that saw me oft Shut up my book elate, and dance with glee. O liberty! how passing sweet art thou To him who labours at the constant oar Sorely reluctant, to the pining boy Who loves enlargement, and abhors his chain. So on thy banks too, Isis, have I stray'd, A tassel'd student. Witness you who shar'd My morning walk, my ramble at high noon, My evening voyage, an unskilful sail, To Godstow bound, or some inferior port, For strawberries and cream. What have we found In life's austerer hours, delectable As the long day so loiter'd? Ye profound And serious heads, who guard the twin retreats Of British learning, give the studious boy His due indulgence. Let him range the field, Frequent the public walk, and freely pull The yielding oar. But mark the truant well, And if he turn aside to vice or folly, Shew him the rod, and let him feel you prize The parent's happiness, the public good. And you, ye thoughtless young, deem it not hard If sage experience check your wild career, And disappoint your project. Love the hand Which steadily corrects, and be not apt To leave the student's for the jockey's part, To drink and gamble. Will ye thus repay Parental goodness? Who can wonder then, The parent's curse on Alma-mater lights, And the wide world re-echoes with the sound Of terrible reproach. Forbear, forbear. Now comes July, and with his fervid noon Unsinews labour. The swinkt mower sleeps. The weary maid rakes feebly. The warm swain Pitches his load reluctant. The faint steer, Lashing his sides, draws sulkily along The slow encumber'd wain. The hedge-row now Delights, or the still shade of silent lane, Or cool impending arbor, there to read, Or talk and laugh, or meditate and sleep. There let me sit to see the low'ring storm Collect its dusky horrors, and advance To bellow sternly in the ear of night; To see th' Almighty electrician come, Making the clouds his chariot. Who can stand When he appears? The conscious creature flies, And skulks away, afraid to see his God Charge and recharge his dreadful battery. For who so pure his lightning might not blast, And be the messenger of justice? Who Can stand expos'd, and to his Judge exclaim, âMy heart is cleansed, turn thy storm away?â Fear not, ye fair, who with the naughty world Have seldom mingled. Mark the rolling storm, And let me hear you tell, when morning comes, With what tremendous howl the furious blast Blew the large show'r in heavy cataract Against your window; how the keen, the quick, And vivid lightning quiver'd on your bed, And how the deep artillery of heav'n Broke loose, and shook your coward habitation. Fear not; for if a life of innocence, And that which we deem virtue here below, Can hold the forky bolt, ye may presume To look and live. Yet be not bold, but shew Some pious dread, some grave astonishment. For all our worthy deeds are nothing worth; And if the solemn tempest cut us short In our best hour, we are in debt to heav'n. The storm subsided, and the day begun, Who would not walk along the sandy way, To smell the shower's fragrance, see the sun With his sheer eye ascend the zenith joyous, Mark the still-rumbling cloud crowding away Indignant, and embrace the gentle breeze, That idly wantons with the dewy leaf, And shakes the pearly rain-drop to the ground? How sweet the incense of reviving flow'rs! Ye must abroad, ye fair. The angry night Has done you mischief. Ev'ry plant will need Your kindly hand to rear its falling head. Come not St. Swithin with a cloudy face, Ill-ominous; for old tradition says, If Swithin weep, a deluge will ensue, A forty days of rain. The swain believes, And blesses sultry Swithin if he smiles, But curses if he frowns. So boding dames Teach the fray'd boy a thousand ugly signs, Which riper judgment cannot shake aside: And so the path of life is rough indeed, And the poor fool feels double smart, compell'd To trudge it barefoot on the naked flint. For what is judgment and the mind inform'd, Your Christian armour, Gospel-preparation, But sandals for the feet, that tread with ease, Nor feel those harsh asperities of life, Which ignorance and superstition dread? I much admire we ever should complain That life is sharp and painful, when ourselves Create the better half of all our woe. Whom can he blame who shudders at the sight Of his own candle, and foretells with grief A winding sheet? who starts at the red coal Which bounces from his fire, and picks it up, His hair on end, a coffin? spills his salt, And dreads disaster? dreams of pleasant fields, And smells a corpse? and ever shuns with care The unpropitious hour to pare his nails? Such fears but ill become a soul that thinks. Let time bring forth what heavy plagues it will. Who pain anticipates, that pain feels twice, And often feels in vain. Yet, though I blame The man who with too busy eye unfolds The page of time, and reads his lot amiss, I can applaud to see the smiling maid With pretty superstition pluck a rose, And lay it by till Christmas. I can look With much complacency on all her arts To know the future husband. Yes, ye fair, I deem it good to take from years to come A loan of happiness. We could not live, Did we not hope to-morrow would produce A better lot than we enjoy to-day. Hope is the dearest med'cine of the soul, A sweet oblivious antidote, which heals The better half of all the pains of life. Now o'er his corn the sturdy farmer looks, And swells with satisfaction to behold The plenteous harvest which repays his toil. We too are gratified, and feel a joy Inferior but to his, partakers all Of the rich bounty Providence has strew'd In plentiful profusion o'er the field. Tell me ye fair, Alcanor tell me, what Is to the eye more cheerful, to the heart More satisfactive, than to look abroad, And from the window see the reaper strip, Look round, and put his sickle to the wheat? Or hear the early mower whet his scythe, And see where he has cut his sounding way, E'en to the utmost edge of the brown field Of oats or barley? What delights us more, Than studiously to trace the vast effects Of unabated labour? to observe How soon the golden field abounds with sheaves? How soon the oat and bearded barley fall, In frequent lines, before the keen-edg'd scythe? The clatt'ring team then comes, the swarthy hind Down leaps, and doffs his frock alert, and plies The shining fork. Down to the stubble's edge The easy wain descends half built, then turns, And labours up again. From pile to pile With rustling step the swain proceeds, and still Bears to the groaning load the well-poiz'd sheaf. The gleaner follows, and with studious eye And bended shoulders traverses the field To cull the scatter'd ear, the perquisite By heaven's decree assign'd to them who need, And neither sow nor reap. Ye who have sown, And reap so plenteously, and find the grange Too narrow to contain the harvest given, Be not severe, and grudge the needy poor So small a portion. Scatter many an ear, Nor let it grieve you to forget a sheaf, And overlook the loss. For he who gave Will bounteously reward the purpos'd wrong Done to yourselves; nay more, will twice repay The generous neglect. The field is clear'd; No sheaf remains; and now the empty wain A load less honourable waits. Vast toil succeeds, And still the team retreats, and still returns To be again full-fraught. Proceed, ye swains, And make one autumn of your lives, your toil Still new, your harvest never done. Proceed, And stay the progress of the falling year, And let the cheerful valley laugh and sing, Crown'd with perpetual August. Never faint, Nor ever let us hear the hearty shout Sent up to heaven, your annual work complete, And harvest ended. It may seem to you The sound of joy, but not of joy to us. We grieve to think how soon your efforts cease, How soon the plenteous year resigns her fruits, And waits the mute approach of surly Winter. One labour more the cheerful hand awaits; Then the glad year is done. We seize with joy The precious interval, and shape our walk At early evening down the meadow path; Till sunk into the vale, fast by the brook We spy the blooming hop, and with light heart The glorious garden enter. Tell me not, Ye who, in love with wealth, your days consume Pent up in city stench, and smoke, and filth: O tell me not of aught magnificent Or fair as this, in all your public walks. What are the charms your Ranelagh affords Compar'd with ours? Search all your gardens round, Ye shall not find e'en at your boasted Vaux A haunt so neat, so elegant as this. Long let us stray, and frequently repeat Our ev'ning's homage to the blooming hop. Spare him, ye swains, pernicious insects spare, Ye howling tempests, come not near his branch, But let him hang till I have gaz'd my fill. Then shall he fall, and his gay honours shed, And your forbearance plenteously repay With his abundant gold. Long let us stray, Enjoy the grateful covert, and admire The one continu'd cluster over-head Of blossoms interwoven, and depending E'en to the touch and smell. Long let us stray, And ever as we come to the shorn mead, And quit the garden with reluctance, then, When we behold the smiling valley spread In gay luxuriance far before us, sheep And oxen grazing, till the eye is staid, The sinuous prospect turning from the view, And all above us to the left and right Enchanting woodland to the topmost hillâ Then let the village bells, as often wont, Come swelling on the breeze, and to the sun, Half-set, sing merrily their ev'ning song. I ask not for the causeâit matters not. It is enough for me to hear the sound Of the remote exhilarating peal, Now dying all away, now faintly heard, And now with loud and musical relapse Its mellow changes huddling on the ear. So have I stood at eve on Isis' banks, To hear the merry Christ-Church bells rejoice. So have I sat too in thy honour'd shades, Distinguish'd Magdalen, on Cherwell's brink, To hear thy silver Wolsey tones so sweet. And so too have I paus'd and held my oar, And suffer'd the slow stream to bear me home, While Wykeham's peal along the meadow ran. Now let September and October come, Twin months of slaughter. Persecution starts, And ere the dewy day be half awake Begins her bloody work. The fields are throng'd With licens'd murderers, who slay for sport. So when the jealous Herod gave the word, The cruel ruffian thirsted for the blood Of helpless innocents. And so the sword, Another Herod reigning, was let loose To spill the blood of sleeping Huguenots. Alcanor joins them not. He envies none The pleasures of the field, and much admires To hear the squabble and the loud harangue, And all for game; to see the British soul So puny grown, it quarrels for a feather. 'Tis a mean wretch, and scarce deserves to live, Who cannot find amusements void of pain. O undeserving parent, who neglects To train the infant boy to deeds humane. See how his sports, his pastimes, dearest child, Are all to be indulg'd, whether he choose To whip his nurse, to lash the sleeping puppy, Or pinch the tail of unoffending puss. Go, catch the surly beetle, and suspend The harmless pris'ner by the wing or tail, To make the booby laugh. But if so loud His well-deserv'd rebuke, the timid child Stands off alarm'd, then let him see thee crush The thing he fears. Or give it liberty, Not unconstrain'd, as heav'n bestow'd it. No, Set the gall'd pris'ner free, but lock his chain Full-fast about him. Bid him to the field, But pluck no arrow from his side. He's gone, And feels that liberty is wondrous sweet, Though the crook'd pin fast fix'd, and trailing thread, Admit no remedy. A while he livesâ His thread clings fastâhe famishes, and dies. Go, Tom, a ladder bring, and reach the nest, 'Tis but a chirping sparrow's, and 'twill serve To pacify the boy. What if the dam In patient expectation sit, and hope Another day shall all her cares reward, And bring to light her helpless progeny? Forth from her high maternal office dragg'd With rude indignity, behold she comes A joyful victim to the callous boy. He with delight her ruffled plumes surveys, Seizes her nest, and the dear charge purloins; Then with a frantic laugh down drops the eggs, And blindfold hops to crush them as he goes. Ah! hapless bird, yet happy still, if this Be all the pain thy cruel foe intends. Nothing avail'd thy labour of an age To weave the genial nest, with many a root And many a straw far-fetch'd? 'Twas all in vain. Half-starv'd Grimalkin claims thee for his prey, And in his cruel paw fast-clutch'd devours Relentless. Or the boy aware, himself Cuts short existence, and allots to puss Only the sever'd head. Hard-hearted lout, Steel'd executioner, behold the blood Of parent and of offspring. Burn with shame; For thou hast done a deed which Heav'n abhors. Let the wise parent laugh, to see how well His looby boy has learn'd to be humane. Let him applaud the bloody deed, and spare The well-earn'd rod. In thee, great state, Eternal glory of the Gentile world, Just Athens, had the beardless youth perfum'd A deed so villainous, the public arm Had the mean wretch chastis'd, till it had wak'd A soul humane and sensible of wrong. Behold and mark the sturdy fool, at length Grown up to man, (if such he may be deem'd, Possessing nothing human but the shape,) What are his sports? and how delights the dunce From morn to night to spend the live-long day? âCan the swarth Ethiopian change his skin?â Or can the leopard at his will be white, And lay his spots aside? From morn to eve See how he toils with generous intent To be the murd'rer of the tim'rous hare, To win the brush of Reynard nobly skill'd, To vex the badger; or with cruel joy Stoops o'er the cock-pit, eager to behold The dying struggles of poor Chanticleer. 'Twas nature taught the gen'rous bird to fight, And drive the bold intruder from his roost, In care for thee, mean wretch, who hast supply'd The weapon nature kindly had refus'd, Or made to strike in vain. Now mark his gait, When morning hardly dawns, and from the hutch He lets the full-ear'd pointer loose to range. Well arm'd is he, within with morning dram, Without with old surtout, thick shoes, and hose Of leather, button'd to the buckskin'd knee. So forth he fares, brave knight; but first he primes And crams his musket, then suspends his pouch, His powder-horn, and whip with whistle tipt, On his broad shoulders. Let me not forget, What he might well forget, th' important bag, To be ere long (for so he thinks) well lin'd With pheasant, partridge, snipe, or tardy quail. So mounts the popping Hudibras or stile Or crackling hedge, or leaps the muddy ditch, His armour clatt'ring as he goes. I see Where he has swept the silver dew away Across the pasture. Now he climbs the gate, And heys his dog to run the stubble round, While he stands still, or scarcely moves a pace. So have I seen the hasty minute-hand Run round and round, while th' other idly stood, Or seem'd to stand, and with commanding tone Bray'd loud to instigate his race again. Take heed, take heed. With nose infallible The silent pointer winds toward the game. Now motionless he stands, one foot lift up, His nostril wide distended, and his tail Unwagg'd. Now speed, thou hero of the gun, And when the sudden covey springs, let fly And miss them all. O I rejoice to see When our amusements are so innocent They give no pain at all. But spare the whip, And if the wary covey spring too soon, Let Sancho still be safe; and let not rage Prompt thee to stamp upon his guiltless neck Till the blood issue from his lips and nose: Much less let fly upon the faithful cur The volley fate has spar'd, for he is staunch, And true to thee as thou art false to him. O thoughtless world, that will not be at pains To cultivate humanity in youth. 'Tis hence we laugh at woe, and ev'ry day Unpitying hear the cries of half a world Vex'd with the galling scourge of slavery. My eye is cast on Britain's western isles, And I behold a patient slave grown faint Under the lash. Inhuman dog, forbear: The man who now lies bleeding at thy feet Was once a monarch. To the bloody field He led a num'rous tribe, attach'd by deeds Of pure affection to their leader. He No laws of mutiny had fram'd, nor fear'd To see desertion thin his peopled ranks. Bravely he fought, and hardly would submit, Surviving only he. Then first he knew What 'twas to faint, when looking for his friends He saw them dead and bleeding at his side. Nor had he then let fall his well-strung bow, And shook the poison'd quiver from his side, Were there one arrow left, or still surviv'd He for whose life and happiness he fought, His only son. Him reeking in his blood The hapless monarch saw, and could no more. Then spare him yet. What if he left his task, And sought the friendly shade to vent his grief Yet recent. True, he slept, and at an hour When industry was busy. 'Twas the call Of sympathizing nature, that would pour One balm at least upon his countless wounds. Poor soul, he slept, and fancy to his mind Restor'd again the days he once had seen. Forth from his hut he went, his only son And wife (now more than widow) by his side. He tipt his arrow, strung his bow, and shot. The stricken bird was her's, and her's the deer. Laden with these, his choicest gifts, he sought His humble palace once again; there sat And ate his plain and temperate repast, And the too-fleeting hours beguil'd with talk Of twenty thousand dangerous escapes From cruel tiger, or more cruel man. And was this little happiness too much? The sword of justice surely will unsheath, Nor fall in vain upon these guilty isles. Cross not again the proud Atlantic wave, With hellish purpose to enslave the free, Or load the pris'ner with eternal chains, For he is Man as thou art. Not for thee, And only thee, did God's creative Word Call into being this vast work, the world. Nor yet for thee that Word incarnate shed His precious blood. Go, cruel tyrant, go, Reign in the forests of thy native isle, And let the prowling savage reign in his. Let him enjoy the little bliss he owns, Or give him more. Make not his little less, For Adam was his sire, and Adam thine; And he shall share redemption too with thee, With thee, and me, and all this Gentile world, If we deserve to rank in brotherhood With one we wrong so much. Content were he To tread the burning desert, feel the sun Dart his fierce rays direct upon his head, And earn the little plenty his wild state Affords, with hunter's toil. Content were he To be an humble pensioner at best Of the grim lion; but the cursed hand Of brutal avarice that peace destroys, That little peace which the brave lion spares. September half elaps'd, the day returns, Remember'd oft with awful reverence And pious love of thee, All-seeing Power, Who follow'st virtue wheresoe'er she roves, Her shield and buckler. On the sunny down Eliza stray'd. Ah! why alone? 'Twas so The tempter vanquish'd Eve; 'twas so she fell. She stray'd and mus'd, she pluck'd a flow'r and sung. She knew no fear, accustom'd oft to range The pleasant hill, and deeming none less good, Less honest than herself. But such the world, We cannot find the place, howe'er remote From public notice, which escapes the search Of prying lust. A fierce Hibernian whelp, Strong as the tiger, subtle as the fox, Saw and was pleas'd. No bar to him his vow Made at the altar, to be constant still To her he wedded there. In his false heart He fed adult'rous hope, he couch'd and slunk, And with a leer the solitary down Survey'd, far as the jealous eye can reach. So Satan lurk'd, and joy'd to find alone Ingenious Eve; and he his proem tun'd With flattery and lies, and so didst thou. Into the heart of Eve his words made way: Eliza heard not thine. For she had mark'd And knew her tempter; she had well observ'd, Unknown to thee, thy often-practis'd wiles. What wonder then thy eulogy was vain? Thy large account of honour and of wealth Mov'd only her derision, nor could win One smile, one kiss, one look of approbation. Here had thy passion ceas'd, thou might'st at least Have challeng'd honour with the fiend of Hell. But foil'd, and still repuls'd, thy hungry soul Had baser means to dare. Her reason proof, Thy next resource unmanly violence. What guilty marks left not thy greedy hand Upon the fair one's arm? so mighty thou To combat virtue, to assail a maid No match for thee but in so good a cause. Yet hadst thou vanquish'd, but a pow'r unseen Approv'd her efforts, and resisted thine. What saw'st thou, coward, to be put to flight Swift as the hostile arrow? Mark my words. The man of noble purpose nothing daunts, No, not a falling world. He were compos'd And stedfast as a rock, though floods of fire The world and all its fellows swept away, And he beheld a universe in flames. Then was the mighty foil'd, the cunning caught: And yet he blushes not. Accus'd, he starts, Protests his innocence, appeals to justice, Unlocks the copious fountain of his eye, And who can say it is not strange and piteous? Yet why decays his honour, spite of tears, Of protestations and appeals, of threats, And public insolence? Ah me! I fear Eliza may forgive thee, but in vain; And though insulted Justice slumber here, She will arraign thee at the bar of Heaven, And, spite of Charity, the wrong repay. Now comes the happy morning long desir'd By rural lads and lasses. Light appears. The swain is ready in his Sunday frock, And calls on Nell to trip it to the fair. The village bells are up, and jangling loud Proclaim the holiday. The clam'rous drum Calls to the puppet-show. The groaning horn And twanging trumpet speak the sale begun, Of articles most rare and cheap. Dogs bark, Boys shout, and the grave Doctor mounts sublime His crowded scaffold, struts, and makes a speech, Maintains the virtue of his salve for corns, His worm-cake and his pills, puffs his known art, And shews his kettle, silver knives and forks, Ladle and cream-pot, and, to crown the bait, The splendid tankard. Andrew grins, and courts The gaping multitude, till Tom and Sue And Abigail and Ned their shoulders shrug. And laugh and whisper, and resolve to sport The solitary shilling. Simple swains And silly maids, you laugh, but Andrew wins: And what for you but sorrow and remorse, Or box of salve to plaister disappointment? Unless the smart of folly may be sooth'd By Andrew's cheerful pranks, the dancing girl, And frolic tumbler. Now the street is fill'd With stalls and booths for gingerbread and beer, Rear'd by enchantment, finish'd in a trice. Amusements here for children old and young; For little master's pence, a coach, a drum, A horse, a wife, a trumpet; dolls for miss, Fans, cups and saucers, kettles, maids and churns. For idle school-boys Punchinello rants, The juggler shuffles, and the artful dame Extends her lucky-bag. For infants tall, Of twenty years and upwards, rueful games, To whirl the horse-shoe, bowl at the nine pins, Game at the dial-plate, drink beer and gin, Vapour and swear, cudgel, get drunk and fight. Then comes the ass-race. Let not wisdom frown, If the grave clerk look on, and now and then Bestow a smile; for we may see, Alcanor, In this untoward race the ways of life. Are we not asses all? We start and run, And eagerly we press to pass the goal, And all to win a bauble, a lac'd hat. Was not great Wolsey such? He ran the race, And won the hat. What ranting politician, What prating lawyer, what ambitious clerk, But is an ass that gallops for a hat? For what do Princes strive, but golden hats? For diadems, whose bare and scanty brims Will hardly keep the sun-beam from their eyes. For what do Poets strive? a leafy hat, Without or crown or brim, which hardly screens The empty noddle from the fist of scorn, Much less repels the critic's thund'ring arm. And here and there intoxication too Concludes the race. Who wins the hat, gets drunk. Who wins a laurel, mitre, cap, or crown, Is drunk as he. So Alexander fell, So Haman, CÃ¦sar, Spenser, Wolsey, James. Now chilly ev'ning, in her grey coat clad, Advances from the east, and puts to flight The rear of day, girt with a zone of stars. The busy fair is ended. The rank booth Expels its beastly habitant the mob, And Andrew's laughable conceit is hush'd. Home reels the drunken clown, or stays to fight, Nothing the cause, yet honour much concern'd. Confusion reigns, uproar and loud misrule; Distinctions cease, and still the oath, the scream, The shout, the hoot, disturb the midnight ear Of sober Cloe gone to bed betimes. Ah me! the golden year is fled. Behold Gloomy and sad November, with a brow Severe and clouded. Scarce a leaf sustains His pestilential blast. The woods are stript, And all their honours scatter'd in the vale. Th' ambassador of surly Winter he, And in his hand he bears the nipping frost. Before his tyrant lord he scatters sleet, And with a hideous frown bids Autumn speed, And after her runs howling through the land. The field has lost its verdure. All the pride Of the sweet garden fades. Where now the rose, The lupin, after, balsam, or carnation? Or where the lily with her snowy bells? Where the gay jasmin, odorous syringa, Graceful laburnum, or bloom-clad arbute? Or if we stray, where now the summer's walk So still and peaceable at early eve, Along the shady lane, or through the wood, To pluck the ruddy strawberry, or smell The perfum'd breeze that all the fragrance stole Of honey-suckle, blossom'd beans, or clover? Where now the blush of Spring, and the long day Beloiter'd? cheerful May, that fill'd the woods With music, scatter'd the green vale with flow'rs, And hung a smile of universal joy Upon the cheek of nature? Where blooms now The king-cup or the daisy? Where inclines The harebell or the cowslip? Where looks gay The vernal furze with golden baskets hung? Where captivates the sky-blue periwinkle Under the cottage-eaves? Where waves the leaf, Or rings with harmony the merry vale? Day's harbinger no song performs, no song Or solo anthem deigns sweet Philomel. The golden wood-pecker laughs loud no more. The pye no longer prates; no longer scolds The saucy jay. Who sees the goldfinch now The feather'd groundsel pluck, or hears him sing In bower of apple blossoms perch'd? Who sees The chimney-haunting swallow skim the pool, And quaintly dip, or hears his early song Twitter'd to dawning day? All, all are hush'd. The very bee her merry toil foregoes, Nor seeks her nectar, to be sought in vain. Only the solitary robin sings, And perch'd aloft with melancholy note Chants out the dirge of Autumn; cheerless bird, That loves the brown and desolated scene, And scanty fare of Winter. Let me weep With you, ye Muses, and with you, ye fair, Chief mourner at the grave of her we love, Expiring nature. For ye sought with me The sober twilight of the shelving wood, With me forsook the glare of sultry day, To tread the serious gloom Religion loves, And where she smiles and wipes her dewy eye, With Meditation walking hand in hand. Ye too have lov'd and heartily approv'd The winding foot-path, and its sudden curve, And swarded wain-way like cathedral aisleâ And heard me comment on the leaf, the branch, The arm, the girth of the paternal oak. Ye too have lov'd the long frequented brow, Which ever unexpectedly displays The clear cerulean prospect of the vale. Oft have ye stood upon the shaggy brink Of yonder wood-clad hill, to gaze with me Athwart the wide and far-extended view, Which ocean skirts or blue downs indistinct. Oft have ye look'd with transport pure as mine Into the flow'ry dell. But ah! no more We wander heedless; Winter's wind forbids. The piercing cold commands us shut the door, And rouse the cheerful hearth; for at the heels Of dark November, comes with arrowy scourge The tyrannous December. Joyless now The morning sun scarce seen, and clouded eve. No genial influence sheds noon, eclips'd. Sad scenes ensue; brief days, and blust'ring nights, And snows, such as the winter-loving Muse Of Cowper paints well pleas'd, and such as mine Views not unsatisfied. For though without Bleak winds and pinching frosts, within is joy, And harmony, and peace. Say, Muse, how pass The frozen hours of Winter, the long eve, The gloomy morn, the cold and cheerless day, At the lone mansion that invests the fair And Village Curate. Genius there unfolds Her quick impassion'd page; and Nature there And Art their secret treasures all display. There dance the jocund maids of Memory In everlasting round. Heroic Song Her swelling act proclaims, and Eloquence Flows with her smooth and even tide along. Transported History the same records Of ages past and gone, and, nothing vex'd Or wearied with her long exact account, O'erleaps the boundaries of present time, And, led by Prophecy, extends her tale, Fondly perhaps, to the world's consummation. Then Music cheers, and sympathetic sounds Make smooth the way for serious Tragedy: Then dialogue and high dispute, the song, The dance, the hearty laugh, and flippant wit Of merry Comedy. Urania then Points to the starry firmament, or moon Eclips'd, and holds attention mute, the while With moving finger she describes the course Of planetary stars, or with sweet voice Tells whither she led up her heav'nly bard To visit light, and draw empyreal air; Or whither Newton, more than mortal then, When, musing as he sat, she shook the tree, And dropt an apple, and her studious child Caught up to heav'n. 'Tis pleasant to remark How early genius plumes her for the flight, And tries her short excursions, fearful yet, And little on her wing confiding, now Full-fledg'd and dauntless, soaring to the clouds, And peering in the eye of heav'n itself. Sagacious Newton, let me muse with thee, And wonder at thy quick and piercing eye Cleans'd of its mortal film. Who does not wish Like thee to penetrate the dark abode Of clouded mystery, and in his word And works unfold the fearful Deity? But not at Newton only to admire, Ye studious fair, we love, but sometimes laugh At Brahe and Descartes; praise the strong eye Of Galileo, and applaud the speed Of holy Wilkins, posting like a witch Upon a restive broom-stick to the moon. And sometimes thee, ingenious Boyle, we hear, Maintaining truth and sifting nature; thee Sometimes, whose patriotic genius foil'd Assailant Rome, and almost sav'd the state Of falling Syracuse: then travel round The universal globe, at ev'ry shore Taking large draughts of story and of song. But chiefly thee we love, majestic Britain, Wedded to Neptune, and thy thund'ring fleets Follow exulting to the hostile shore; Now bear thee company to farthest Ind, Or to the frozen pole, or round the cape Of utmost Horn, with philosophic touch Converting dross to gold: now disembark, And march with Harry to the heart of France, And beard the wordy Monarch on his throne. And now we follow to the cannon's mouth Tremendous Marlb'rough; or stand by, and see The living Elliot scare his foe to death With everlasting show'r of burning hail. And many more we praise, and some accuse Whose names and deeds my speedy muse sings not. And now morality we love, and truth, And serious argument, and grave debate; What Mede or Newton with prophetic eye Divine, what Hales or Tillotson advise. Anon we smile with zealous Latimer, Or silent Addison, then range at large Cervantes, Sidney, Bacon, Fenelon, And twenty thousand more choice wits and rare. But chiefly thee, immortal Shakespear, thee We love and honour, Nature's darling child, And still we court thy Muse, and still applaud, Whether the gentle Portia tread the stage With bloody Shylock, or Vincentio wed The virtuous Isabel. Whether thy fays Dance to the moon, or Prospero dispatch His sight-outrunning Ariel to the deep, The while the generous Miranda cheers Her fainting Ferdinand. Whether the Duke And gloomy Jaques confer, and Rosalind Laugh at her sighing lover in disguise; Or smiling Perdita come tripping forth With mint and marj'ram, rosemary and rue: Or Viola, that never told her love, But let concealment like a worm i' th' bud Feed on her damask cheek. With hearty laugh We still dismiss the still outwitted rogue, But still pretending Falstaff. Then we trace With terror and applause the bloody deeds Of civil rage, and full of horror see Thy mailed Mars upon his altar sit Up to the ears in blood; the fatal cause Aspiring Bolingbroke. Thence wrath ensued, And frequent bickering, and stedfast hate. The lie resounded, and the gauntlet fell, And ev'ry tongue cried traitor. To the field They rush'd insane, and ev'ry blade drank blood. So Percy fell, and old Northumberland, Three Dukes of Somerset three-fold renown'd, Two Cliffords, virtuous Humphry, Suffolk, York. So Montague and Warwick, two brave bears, That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion, And made the forest tremble when they roar'd. Then comes despotic Richard, in thy lines, Great bard, supremely horrible, his eye Still bent on murder, tho' his blunted sword Is dull with use, and his destructive arm Claims respite, wearied. Wolsey then laments Unstable fortune, and the favour lost Of fickle Harry, and we too lament. Now pitied and applauded, Timon raves; And lofty Coriolanus scorns the shout Of popular applause, thence basely doom'd To banishment and death. Then Brutus strikes, And bleeding Julius, looking for his friend, Dies by his hand. In hurly-burly then, By ghosts and witches circled round, Macbeth In fiery storm stalks by, with tim'rous eye And fretful conscience, shunning the decree Of blood for blood. Then Imogen delights, And eagerly we trace th' eventful scene, Till all winds up into a happy close. Not such the fortune of afflicted Lear And poor Cordelia, of thy injur'd wife Jealous Othello, of the maid distraught Ophelia, or thy bride that slept with death, Too hasty Romeo. Yet these delight, And in their dread catastrophe dispense Wholesome correction to the bleeding heart. The Poet silent, long with rapture heard, The Shakespear of another art succeeds. Sweet Music wakes, and with OrphÃ©an air Handel begins. What mortal is not rapt To hear his tender wildly-warbled song, Whate'er the theme, but chiefly when he sings Messiah come, and with amazing shout Proclaims him King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, For ever and for ever. Hallelujah. Great soul, O say from what immortal fount Thou hast deriv'd such never-failing power To win the soul, and bear it on the wings Of purest ecstasy, beyond the reach Of ev'ry human care. From whence thine art To lift us from the earth, and fix us there Where pure devotion with unsparing hand Pours on the altar of the living God The hallow'd incense of the grateful heart? O mighty Handel, what seraphic power Gave inspiration to thy sacred song? Thyself perchance wast some supernal spirit, Permitted to reside on earth awhile, To teach us here what music is in heaven. If ev'ry Angel that attends the throne Of clouded Deity such song inspire, Let but our mortal ears one chorus hear, And all the world were gather'd into Heav'n. The very Devils surely were drawn up To listen at the golden doors of light, And Hell left wasteful, wide, and desolate. Corelli, sweet harmonious bird, thee too We hear delighted, and thy mellow strains Deem no mean recompense for the lost song Of lark and nightingale. Thy air repeat, And let judicious discord still commend Triumphant harmony, till Winter's self Be won like us, and smooth his rugged brow, And all his hours enchanted fleet away, Soft as his fur, and quiet as his snow. And oft we feel the soul-subduing power Of vocal harmony, breath'd softly forth And gently swell'd accordant, without aid Of quaint embellishment, save only such As Nature dictates, and without design Lets fall with ease in her impassion'd mood. Then serious glee and elegy delight, Or pious anthem, such as Croft inspires, Or graver Purcel, or endearing Clark. The noble harmonies of Brewer, Este, Webbe, Baildon, Ravenscroft, we hear With ever new delight. Brisk canzonet Then pleases, gay duet, or Highland air Divinely warbled, and with cadence sweet And tender pause prolong'd by one we love, Spontaneous and unask'd. And oft the soul With patriotic ardour glows, and pants For glory, honour, and immortal deeds, Transported at the sound of martial strains With sudden burst commenc'd, and moving slow With solemn grandeur and majestic pomp To an obstreperous rebounding close. But who shall tell in simple strain like mine The many shapes that Music, Proteus-like, Puts on, with grateful change of subject, time, Contrivance, mood, soothing the captive ear, And filling the rapt soul with fare so sweet That still it feeds and hungers. Mortal voice Shall ill relate with what harmonious art She fashions pleasure to the various mind. What wonder then the sulky wheels of time Fly glibly round, the drowsy pendulum Foregoes his old vexatious click unheeded, And the shrill-sounding bell proclaims apace The brief accomplish'd hours. By Music won, Decrepit Time forgets his annual gout, Renews his dance, and with a noiseless foot Hies speedily away. I have not told, How oft we listen to the musty song Of ancient bards, nor think we need excuse To honour merit in her home-spun suit. And chiefly we esteem thy fairy song, Immortal Spenser, in rude guise yclad. Then the fierce knight advances o'er the plain, Drad for his derring do and bloody deed. And now the combat 'gins, and cruel arms The recreant knight o'erwhelm in uncouth fray. The castle falls, and many a maid is won, And many a maid is lost through dire mishap. Then comes a troop in gilded uniform, The goodly band Johnsonian. Cowley first, Poetic child, whose philosophic muse Distracts, delights, torments, and captivates. Let me attend, when, from the world retir'd, He turn'd his restive Pegasus to graze, And thought, and wrote, sedate and sober prose. Comes Milton next, that like his wakeful bird Sings darkling, sings and mourns his eye-sight lost, And nightly wanders to the Muses' haunt, Clear spring, or shady grove, or sunny hill, Smit with the love of sacred song; to us Displaying nature, and the blissful scenes Of Paradise, though not to him returns Day, or the sweet approach of ev'n or morn, Or sight of vernal bloom, or summer's rose, Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine. Sweet bard, that bears us softly now, and, smooth As that unwrinkled flood that slowly winds By Windsor's haughty tow'rs, and visits shores Divinely variousârushes now, and leaps, Confounding sense, immeasurable depth, A foaming cataract, whose thund'ring fall Disorders hell, and utmost earth and heav'n. Comes Butler then, incomparable wit, And not to be reprov'd, save when his muse Decorum overleaps, and here and there Bolts the coarse jest, to the chaste eye and ear Offensive; for behind the comic mask We find the scholar and the man of sense, The friend of virtue, and the foe of vice. Then follows courtly Waller, and in vain On Amoret or Saccharissa calls, With budget full of trifles, birth-day odes, Congratulations, songs, and compliments, And mythologic tales. Then Denham charms, And from his own Parnassus, Cooper's Hill, Sings the wide prospect that extended lies Under his proud survey. Then Sprat. And then Roscommon fills with elegant remark, His verse as elegant; unspotted lines Flow from a mind unspotted as themselves. Then Wilmot tunes his reed, and in his song Gives early specimen of genius, rare And prone to excellence. But ah! how vain Poetic hopes! The prime of life is lost, His talent wasted, and the giddy fool Grows old in pleasure, and denies his God. The grave in view, a holy friend his guide, He views his conduct with remorse, repents, Acknowledges his fault, curses the wit Of erring man that so outwits itself, And dies, a martyr to the pains of vice. Then Yalden sings, and fills us with delight, His harp so tun'd that as the morning breaks It breathes spontaneous rapture, and again At ev'ning close with solemn eulogy Welcomes the reign of night. With dewy eye But harlot tear, then Otway's muse begins, And charms who hears her with her Syren air; To decency, alas, no friend, to vice No enemy. His Celia then proclaims Enamour'd Duke, at Floriana's grave Sweet lamentation chanting. Dorset then Hums nobly liberal, and hums too much, Scarce heard an hour. Chaste Montague succeeds, Stepney less pure, and Walsh with feeble wing Half flying, half on foot. Then comes a bard, Worn out and penniless, and poet still Though bent with years, and in impetuous rhyme Pours out his unexhausted song. What muse So flexible, so generous as thine, Immortal Dryden. From her copious fount Large draughts he took, and unbeseeming song Inebriated sang. Who does not grieve, To hear the soul and insolent rebuke Of angry satire from a bard so rare? To trace the lubricous and oily course Of abject adulation, the lewd line Of shameless vice, from page to page, and find The judgment brib'd, the heart unprincipled, And only loyal at th' expence of truth, Of justice, and of virtue? Meaner strain The dapper wit commends of sprightly Garth. We smile to see fantastic Poetry Shake hands with Physic, and with grave burlesque Arrange his gallipots, and gild his pills; Then march in dreadful armour to the field, To screen her new ally from hostile shocks, With pestle truncheon, Cloacinian helm, And levell'd squirt. Then heartily we laugh With laughter-loving King, and much applaud That vein of mirth which, innocent and clear, In silver neatness flows. Young Phillips then, Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme, A shilling, breeches, and chimeras dire, Sings gravely jocund. Dismal rag applauds, With sympathetic ardour touch'd, at sound Of tatter'd galligaskins, college duns, And subtle catchpole. Modest Pomfret then, To soar aloft unable, with light wing Above the plain scarce elevated skims, A short and feeble flight. So have I seen The spaniel-hunted quail with lowly wing Shear the smooth air: and so too have I heard That she can sweetly clamour, though compell'd To tread the humble vale, nor ever mount High as the ev'ning swift or morning lark. Then blameless Hughes, in union with Pepusch, Still to the eloquent orchestra tunes His virtuous, unmeaning song. And now, In tones that might attract an angel's ear, Flows the smooth strain of righteous Addison. Then Blackmore says an everlasting tale, Bless'd with a callous muse. Genius in vain Laughs at the fond attempt, for still he bawls, And with gigantic dissonance subdues The universal hiss. No poetâtrueâ But mark the man, and you shall find him good. And what's the poet if the man be naught? Let Buckingham reply. Genius and wit May flourish for a day, and snatch the wreath From awkward probity; but soon shall fade The ready laurels of a vicious muse, While amaranthine honours crown the brow Of unpoetic virtue. Waller's muse In courteous Granville lives, in Granville dies. Who can refuse applause to tragic Rowe? Who can withhold his honest praise from thee, Tickel, thou friend of Addison, and virtue? Who is not startled at the fertile wit Of beardless Congreve? and who does not grieve That 'twas not drawn in the defence of virtue? How sweet the music of thy happy lines, Poetic Prior; full of mirth thy muse, And exquisite her jest. Ah! hear it not, Ye sober fair, for fulsome is the tale, And only fit for the distemper'd ear Of jovial libertines. His graver song Applaud unsatisfied, and ever laugh To see him mount his furious Pegasus Pindaric, often back'd, but back'd in vain, And never to be tam'd by crazy wits. 'Twas an unruly and a hard-mouth'd horse, âAnd slung his rider if he sat not sure,â Dan Cowley said. Yet up sprung Mat, resolv'd. O'er sea and land with an unbounded loose Runs the mad steed, a Gilpin race I ween. Hardly the muse can sit the head-strong horse. See, now she gallops round the Belgic shore, Now through the raging ocean ploughs her way, To rough Ierne's camps; there sounds alarms, In the dank marshes finds her glorious theme, And plunges after him through Boyne's fierce flood. Back to his Albion then, then with stiff wing East, over Danube and Propontis' shores, From the MÅotis to the northern sea, To visit the young Muscovite; thence up, Resolv'd to reach the high empyrean sphere, And ask for William an Olympic crown. Till, lost in trackless fields of shining day, Unhors'd, and all revers'd, down, down she comes, Comes rushing with uncommon ruin down. Glorious attempt, but not unhappy fate. 'Twas lucky, Mat, thou had'st not giv'n a name To some Icarian gulf, or shook at least The carnal man so sore, that he had limp'd, And lamely hobbled to the verge of life; But, thanks to fate, thy pace is even yet, And happily the Muse her mirthful song In durance vile prolongs. So have I heard The captive finch, in narrow cage confin'd, Charm all his woe away with cheerful song, Which might have melted e'en a heart of steel To give him liberty. Hence, hence, away Ye meaner wits, hide your diminish'd heads, See genius self approaches. Homer's soul A puny child informs. Let envy laugh To see an urchin ugly as herself The glory of our isle. For thee, great bard, We twine the laurel wreath, and grant it thine Thrice-won. Shall any mortal tongue presume To scatter censure on thy charming page? Hark, 'tis the din of twenty thousand curs Who bark at excellence. Who best deserves Must feel the scourge of infinite abuse, For man to man is fiercer than the wolf, More cruel than the tiger. Who can brook The sight of aught more worthy than himself? Invite an angel from the courts of heav'n, Our critic eye shall spy a thousand faults Where not a fault exists. Mistake me not, I name not thee an angel, haughty bard, Thy deeds were human. With an honest heart I love the poet, but detest the man. Thy purer lays what mortal can despise, Thy baser song what mortal can approve, Thou witty, dirty, patriotic Dean? Laugh on, laugh on. With pencil exquisite Picture the features of encourag'd vice, And fashionable folly. Give the fair, The peerless Stella, everlasting worth, Deride thy narrow paper-sparing friend; And gall the great. But why shall thy sweet Muse Turn scavenger, and the foul kennel rake For themes and similes? What heart but grieves, To find an equal portion in thy song Of elegantly fair and grossly foul? Now honest Gay, a city shepherd, sings, Nor sings in vain to us. In Arcady We love to stray, and dream of happy days No eye has seen, no heart has felt. We love The land of Fairy, and the puny deeds Of dapper elves. Whate'er the frantic poet In his wild mood imagines, we applaud. Nor wholly scorn with Gay or Broom to stray, Or Ambrose Philips, through enchanted land To painted meadows, flow'ry lawns and hills, To crystal floods, cool groves, and shady bow'rs, And rills that babble, tinkle, purl, and murmur. How sweet the song that from thy mellow pipe, Dear Parnel, flow'd. Death overheard amaz'd, And his stone couch forsook, all wonder now, And now all envy. Sure he thought no bard Of mortal mixture could such tones create; Or if of mortal mixture, he had liv'd Double the days of man, and stol'n from years Due to the reign of silence and of death, Song so divine. With the bad thought possess'd, He keen'd his arrow on a flint, advanc'd, And threw it greedily, his lipless jaws Gnashing with hate. So fell betimes the bard, So triumph'd death, and at the bloody deed Shook his lean bones with laughter. Cursed fiend, Thou bane of excellence, go hence, and laugh; Yet shall the pious poet sing again, And thou shalt hear, and with eternal wrath Ay burning, dance with agony, and gnaw, Howling for pain, the adamantine gates Of treble-bolted Hell. Away, kind bards; Enough of you, nor shall your song beguile One moment more; for see again sweet Spring Laughs at our window, and with rosy hand Shews the full blossom and the budded leaf. Away, away. Some wintry day be thine, Descriptive Thomson; some December night, Thine, pious Young; some melancholy morn, In wat'ry fog involv'd, thine, orphan Savage. Be thou our close companion, Shenstone, thou, Sweet bard of Hagley, in the hawthorn shade Some weary Summer's noon. Be thou our guest, Impetuous Akenside, some gloomy eve, When the red lightning scarce begins to glare, And the mute thunder hardly deigns to growl. Rais'd by thy torrent song, we shall enjoy The loud increasing horrors of the storm, Awfully grand. At such a time thee too, Rapt in ferocious ecstasy, we call, Terrific Gray, to sweep thy sullen lyre, And give to madness the distracted soul. Repose at leisure, ye inferior bards, Till Summer's beauty flies, and the green wood Scatters her recent honours to the breeze. So have I gayly sung the man how bless'd, The Village Curate; weaving in my song Your praise, ye fair, and many an honest thought Which unsolicited demanded room. I care not if no eye this page peruse; I sung with pleasure, and I cease with joy. I sing no more, and blame him not who sleeps, Careless what I, enamour'd of the vale And hilly woodland, have so vainly sung. For popular applause, I ask it not. True, noble Critic, it were ill deserv'd, By this rude song obtain'd. Yet I not fear, Ere the short tale of my existence close, Some happy strain on my time-mellow'd harp To hit, these woods may well remember. Yes, Some happy strain, by chance, I hope to hit, If yet the Muses love thy fam'd retreat, O Sidney, or thy Spenser's early song; If yet the walks where love-sick Waller mus'd, If yet immortal Saccharissa's haunt Delight them, and sweet Amoret's abode. ADRIANO, OR THE FIRST OF JUNE. ?neque adhuc Varo videor nec dicere Cinna Digna, sed argutos inter strepere anser olores. Virg. Far in the bosom of an ancient wood, Whose frowning oaks in a deep valley grew Between two lofty cliffs, and to the sea Stretch'd out their broad impenetrable shade, There stood a cottage. 'Twas the lone abode Of Adriano, and his only child Maria. Here had they been lost, till time Had hurried to oblivion twenty years. 'Twas all his care to nourish her, all her's To cherish him. He taught her to be good, To love retirement and the quiet cell, And shield her virtue from the sight of men. She heard and heeded, and no pleasure knew Apart from solitude and Adriano. Her only walk without him and alone Was to a village near, to purchase food, Or what domestic want might farther need, And her own industry could ill supply: And ever as she jocund tripp'd it home, Her osier basket dangling on her arm, And Frisk behind her barking at her heels, She met her sire in tears. Constant was he To meet his child returning, and his tears As duly shed. Oft had she ask'd the cause, But ask'd in vain; till one fair summer's eve (The last that follow'd in the train of May) She urg'd her suit once more, and not in vain. He smil'd, and told her he had things to tell Would wake attention in the senseless rock. âTo-morrow, child, 'tis one-and-twenty years âSince to this wretched world thy mother bare thee; âAnd, as I oft have told thee weeping, died. âShe wasâI cannot say how goodâGod knows. âI could have borne the loss. For though she died âTo me and thee, she liv'd to peace and Heav'n. âSuch virtue could not perish, but be sure âIs as the heav'ns eternal, and shall die âNever. Yes, yes, I could have borne the loss, âAnd thought it much to have thee left behind âHelpless and ever-crying. 'Twas enough. âI might have train'd thee to thy mother's virtue, âAnd, satisfied to see her live again âIn a deserving daughter, have gone down âIn humble quiet to my grave; secure âThat hungry penury should never haunt âAnd tempt thy goodness. For I had, my child, âEnough of Fortune's bounty to supply âMy ev'ry want, and something for the hand âOf the lean beggar, who now shuns my door, âOr asks in vain. I had, my child, enough; âAnd would I had it still. For when swift time âHas counted all my days, and these grey locks âAre call'd to shelter in the silent grave; âWhen this resulting heart shall cease to beat, âAnd this warm hand that now encloses thine âBe cold and lifeless, how shall thy poor self âEscape the lion-tooth of craving want? âWho will protect thee from the winning baits âOf greedy lust? Who clothe these tender limbs? âWho give thee food?â He said, and said no more; For grief was swelling in Maria's heart, And the big tear stole trembling from her eye. She hung her head, and look'd upon the ground To hide it; but the gen'rous parent saw, And caught her in his arms. âFear not, my child; âLet us wipe off these unbecoming tears, âAnd cease to sigh and sob: for He who clothes âThe lilies of the field, shall clothe thee too. âHe who protects the little chirping bird, âHiding her nest in foliage, and her young âFeeding with plenty, shall protect my child; âShall keep her as the apple of an eye, âShall feed her, shall invite her to his arms, âShall shield her with his wings. Thou shalt be safe âUnder his downy pinions. Thou shalt fear âBy night no terror, and no storm by day: âHis own eternal armour shall be thine: âThe lurking adder shall not hurt thy foot: âSorrow and sickness shall not vex thy heart.â He said, and led her to the cottage door, Dispos'd the basket, comforted and kiss'd her. Then to the garden bow'r together both, Link'd arm in arm, proceeded. There they sat, And he his melancholy tale rehears'd, And she was all attention. He began, And told her of his youth and boyish days Till manhood came, his aged parents died, And he, a sighing lover, sought a wife. Twice was he wedded, and his former love Bore him a son, the cause of all his woe. He train'd him, as he thought, to deeds of praise; He taught him virtue, and he taught him truth, And sent him early to a public school. Here, as it seem'd, (but he had none to blame) Virtue forsook him, and habitual vice Grew in her stead. He laugh'd at honesty, Became a sceptic, and could raise a doubt E'en of his father's truth. 'Twas idly done To tell him of another world, for wits Knew better; and the only good on earth Was pleasure: not to follow that was sin. âSure he that made us, made us to enjoy; âAnd why,â said he, âshould my fond father prate âOf virtue and religion. They afford âNo joys, and would abridge the scanty few âOf nature. Nature be my deity, âHer let me worship, as herself enjoins, âAt the full board of plenty.â Thoughtless boy! So to a libertine he grew, a wit, A man of honour; boastful empty names That dignify the villain. Seldom seen, And when at home, under a cautious mask Concealing the lewd soul, his father thought He grew in wisdom as he grew in years. He fondly deem'd he could perceive the growth Of goodness and of learning shooting up, Like the young offspring of the shelter'd hop, Unusual progress in a summer's night. He call'd him home, with great applause dismiss'd By his glad tutorsâgave him good adviceâ Bless'd him, and bade him prosper. With warm heart He drew his purse-strings, and the utmost doit Pour'd in the youngster's palm. âAway,â he cries, âGo to the seat of learning, boy. Be good, âBe wise, be frugal, for 'tis all I can.â âI will,â said Toby, as he bang'd the door, And wink'd, and snapp'd his finger, âSir, I will.â So joyful he to Alma Mater went A sturdy fresh-man. See him just arriv'd, Receiv'd, matriculated, and resolv'd To drown his freshness in a pipe of port. âQuick, Mr. Vintner, twenty dozen more; âSome claret too. Here's to our friends at home. âThere let 'em doze. Be it our nobler aim âTo liveâwhere stands the bottle?â Then to town Hies the gay spark for futile purposes, And deeds my bashful muse disdains to name. From town to college, till a fresh supply Sends him again from college up to town. The tedious interval the mace and cue, The tennis-court and racket, the slow lounge From street to street, the badger-hunt, the race, The raffle, the excursion and the dance, Ices and soups, dice, and the bet at whist, Serve well enough to fill. Grievous accounts The weekly post to the vex'd parent brings Of college impositions, heavy dues, Demands enormous, which the wicked son Declares he does his utmost to prevent. So, blaming with good cause the vast expence, Bill after bill he sends, and pens the draught Till the full ink-horn fails. With grateful heart Toby receives, short leave of absence begs, Obtains it by a lie, gallops away, And no one knows what charming things are done, Till the gull'd boy returns without his pence, And prates of deeds unworthy of a brute. Vile deeds, but such as in these polish'd days None blames or hides. So Toby fares, nor heeds, Till terms are wasted, and the proud degree, Soon purchas'd, comes his learned toils to crown. He swears, and swears he knows not what, nor cares; Becomes a perjur'd graduate, and thinks soon To be a candidate for Orders. Ah! Vain was the hope. Though many a wolf as fell Deceive the shepherd and devour the flock, Thou none shalt injure. On a luckless day, Withdrawn to taste the pleasures of the town, Heated with wine, a vehement dispute With a detested rival shook the roof. He penn'd a challenge, sent it, fought, and sell; And, if there be for such delinquents room In God's eternal mansions, went to Heav'n. The terrible report in half a day Reach'd Adriano's ear. His wife was dead. Her heav'n-aspiring soul had just forsook Its mortal tenement, her eye was fix'd, And in his own he press'd her pallid hand, Cold as a stone. A longing look he rais'd, And wish'd to follow; but severer lot Chain'd him to earth. âThink then, my child,â says he, âThink what a stroke I felt, when in one day âThy mother died, and thy base brother fell; âThough base belov'd, though worthless yet regretted. âI could not pour on thy lov'd mother's bier âMy debt of grief, but gave her to the earth âEre I had half bewail'd her, or had once âThat honest pleasure known the good man feels âIn shedding sorrow o'er his buried friend. âI hasten'd to my son. I found him dead. âI wept and buried him. And then I thought, âHis debts discharg'd, to have sought thee once more, âMy only comfort left, and liv'd at home âIn honourable ease. But ah, my child, âMuch as I thought for him, he never thought âOr for himself or me. No debt was paid, âBut all my former bounty had been spent âOn vice and folly. Not a single trade âBut brought me some exorbitant demand âOn my diminish'd purse. I paid them all, âAnd little was there left for me and thee, âTo be the slender means of our support. âThanks be to Heaven, like the widow's cruse, âThat little never fail'd. With my own hands âIn this our garden have I daily wrought, âAnd the kind earth has well repaid my toil. âWe have not wanted, but have reap'd enough âThese twenty years, and he that pines for more âDeserves not what he has. I was content, âAnd many a pleasant day have past with thee, âAnd my few books, and antique instrument. âHow chang'd from what I was! but not, so chang'd, âWish I my lot revers'd, or would again âTo the gay world return. Only for thee âGrieves my sad heart with heavy thoughts oppress'd, âAnd not enough relying on His arm âWho knows my wants, and surely will not fail me. âI grieve for thee, who hast not in the world âA friend but me, whose wither'd arm can do âBut little to defend thee, and must soon âDo nothing. True, we found a friend of late, âWhere none had sought him, in the pleasant cot âAt the hill-foot, that stands upon the verge âOf this tall wood, and overlooks the vale. âGilbert is honest, or my eyes deceive me. âI love the two young maids he calls his sisters. âAnna is sensible, Sophia fair, âAnd both are good. I honour such. They come, âSoon as the morrow dawns, to hail the day âWhich gave Maria birth. They sought my door âSoon as the bird was flown, and promis'd me. âBut know, Maria, in this naughty world âThe garb of virtue is assum'd by vice, âAnd hard it is for an experienc'd eye âTo say who merits. Falsehood often lurks âUnder the veil of truth, and seeming worth âIs but the mask to hide a villain's heart. âBe cautious whom you trust. Make none a friend âTill long experience has confirm'd him yours; âBut having tried his worth, and found him true, âGive him thy heart for ever. Such a friend âIs the best blessing human life affords. âFind one and be content: there are not many. âOne in a million. Friendship thus begun âRefines and mellows like a gen'rous wine, âImproves as it grows older, and from age âAcquires a flavour that may charm the taste âOf Cherubim and Angels. Yet be kind âAnd affable to all, and strive with none. âGive none occasion to condemn and hate âAnd wish to injure thee; in all thy words âWise as the serpent, gentle as the dove.â He said and ended, and beheld the moon Through the dark branches of a quiv'ring beech In mellow glory rising. Day was fled, Th' expiring ray of the departed sun Glow'd faintly in the west, and the clear star, That leads him up or lights him to his bed, Was sinking fast into the smiling sea. He rose, and with his daughter sought repose, Ne'er sought in vain under the cottage roof. Sleep on, ye happy cottagers, sleep on; A wakeful eye regards you, sleep in peace. Ye shall not sleep again till sorrow cease, Till Providence reward your faith and truth, And with a world of joy repay your tears. Now day awoke, and the rejoicing sun Rose to the morning chorus of the wood. Sophia saw and heard, and Anna rous'd Yet sleeping. Up they sprung, light as two doves; And now, by fancy dress'd, on Gilbert call To quit his closet, and the scheme complete They yesternight had plann'd. Gilbert was ris'n, And bade the maids good-morrow with his flute. Sophia heard, and, seizing her guitar, Tun'd it in haste. They join'd, and altogether Down the dry path to Adriano's cot In silence hasted. Thither come, they paus'd, And, drawing to the window, all at once Their morning serenade struck up. His flute In smooth persuasive tones young Gilbert blew, Sophia lightly touch'd her soft guitar, And with angelic sweetness Anna sung: Hark! the music morning brings To Adriano's lone retreat, Ev'ry songster gaily sings, Melody how rare and sweet! The steeple-bell with tone so grave, Hear it swell and proudly roar; Hear the solemn sounding wave Die in murmurs on the shore. Hark! the sheepcot how it rings, Loud the distant heifer lows, The village herald claps his wings, Mounts the gate, and stoutly crows. Adriano, hear and rise. Hear, Maria, hear and wake; Hear and lift thy charming eyes, All is cheerful for thy sake. Maria heard, and, startled at the sound, Sprung from her chair, and threw her book aside, For she had risen, as her custom was, At that fine hour when never-loit'ring day Forsakes his chamber, and the glorious sun Shames the dull taper Dissipation holds To light her closing revels. To the door She tripp'd, and, gently peeping, saw unseen Who sung, who play'd. Her little heart was glad, And flutter'd with impatience, like a bird Newly imprison'd. With supreme delight She mark'd the song, and hearken'd to its close: Then lifting cautiously the wooden latch, The door with silence open'd, stood reveal'd, And bade her friends good-morrow, with a smile Improv'd and heighten'd by a glowing blush Might teach the morning envy. Yes, she blush'd Where no shame was. For she was meek as good, And fair as meek. Civility arose, And ev'ry friend who enter'd shook her hand, Gave joy, and took a kissâto thee, fond youth, With some reluctance giv'n, and not obtain'd, However sought, on any day but this, Though she esteems thee much. The board was spread, And ere the guests were seated came the host, And, with a smile that made his hoary locks Lovely as youth, bade welcome. On his child A thousand hearty blessings he bestow'd, And kiss'd her thrice and thrice. Then 'gan the chat, And cheerfully they smil'd at Anna's jest And Adriano's tale. But little time Gave they to rest so soon, accustom'd all At this fine hour to scale the lofty cliff, Where first the rising sun his beams impress'd And drank the dew. With one consent they rose, And, from the wood emerging, clomb the hill, Oft pausing as they went, to gather breath, And view the prospect. To the top at last They come, and drink the wholesome morning breeze, Parent of health and beauty. There they walk, And count the village-steeples, woods and farms, Villas and towns. Now cautiously approach The awful brink of the bold jutting cliff, And look delighted on the boundless sea. Here they remark the azure plain is still And smooth as marble, cover'd here with sails, Here streak'd with shadows from above, and here Ruffled and sparkling like a flood of gems. Here they behold a chain of rocks half hid, And gently wash'd by the returning wave. Here the curl'd waters break upon the shore, They see the foam, and faintly hear the murmur. Upon the beach a fisherman they ken Spreading his nets to dry, his little bark Riding at anchor; but a mite is he, His bark a nut-shell. But not long they look, For story tells of some who gaz'd too much, And, turning giddy, fell, tremendous thought, From top to bottom many a fathom down To certain death. 'Twas like a fall from Heav'n. So cheerfully they turn'd, and down the hill With ease descended to the shady cot. There see them seated, and the good man hear With many a jest and many a merry tale Beguiling time, the while Maria brews The fragrant tea, and fair Sophia waits And deals about her cakes and butter'd roll. From such a hand what mortal can refuse? So to be waited on improves the feast; 'Twould make ambrosia of a peasant's bread, And fill his cup with nectar. She was fair, Was exquisitely fair, and knew it not. Gilbert had told her she was wond'rous plain, And she believ'd him; flying from her glass, And underrating ev'ry grace she had. She courted not the eye, but still withdrew And gave the way to Anna, nothing vex'd To be outdone. So was the lovely maid Quiet and unassuming; quick to serve, As deeming some atonement might be made, For want of charms, by readiness to please. Anna had wit, and heartily she laugh'd To hear the jest go round; the shuttlecock Wits love; and ever as it came to her She struck it smartly, and it swift return'd. Yet she was generous, and never drew But in a cause of honour. Her keen stroke Fell never on the golden shield of truth, Nor treacherously gave a coward scar To unarm'd virtue. Say as much of yours, Ye charitable maidens of threescore, Ye praters, who delight to steal the wreath From merit's blister'd hand, who nettles twine For virtue's tender brow, scourge modest worth, And grant humility a crown of thorns. Anna no wreath had envied or despoil'd. Only at folly, vice, and want of sense She aim'd her shaft, and only there drew blood. No surgeon's lancet had a finer edge, And he that felt it smil'd, content to bleed To purchase health so easy. Gilbert too, Provok'd by merriment, had sense and humour, Which ever as they went kept equal pace, Like steeds well match'd, and neither lagg'd behind, Or overran the other. But at home To graver thoughts he dedicates the day, Taught by his father, a deserving priest, To think. A man of rarest worth was he, And led his children in the paths of truth. He made them virtuous, and died. So left, To the small cot that overlooks the vale, Taking in one wide view the down, the wood, The cultivated champaign, and the sea, They came lamenting. Here they liv'd in peace; A little patrimony all their care, Sav'd by their father from the scanty dues Of one small living: better sav'd, he thought, Than wasted on degrees to make his son A member of the Church, which oft repays Endless expence with forty pounds a year Only for life. So happily they liv'd, Secure at least from want, though little rais'd Above the gen'ral herd. O happy state, And only to be envied! One short year The pleasant cottage had receiv'd its guests, And only miss'd them when the dappled morn Invited to the hill, or silent eve Drew to the wood and Adriano's cot; Or when, as now, with early steps they came To breakfast with Maria. So they sat; And time was brisk, and with his hasty bell Twice rung the finish'd hour, not unobserv'd. Each complimented each to think how soon Hours speed away, when the delighted ear Feeds on the converse of the friend we love. And much was said of life's soon-finish'd race, And happiness that fled as soon as felt, Light as the morning cloud: till Gilbert's hand Drew from his pocket the close-written book Of choice duets, and all were loud for music. Then Anna sang, and in delightful fugue Sophia follow'd. Gilbert blew his flute, And made the mellow harmony complete. Then Anna paus'd, and Gilbert's flute was still, And with soft voice Sophia sang alone. Some awe she felt, and with a downcast eye A modest smile and lightly-waving blush Gave to her song inimitable grace. Then Gilbert join'd again, and Anna sang, And swell'd the chorus, till the list'ning ear Was raptur'd with the sound. And thus they sang: Welcome, welcome, glowing June, Chiefly thou its eldest day, To thee our cheerful song we tune, Thou follower of airy May. Welcome to the sire and us, May no ill thy birth befal; May we ever greet thee thus, Ever welcome to us all. And so they sang till the clear sun grew warm, And the cool shade invited. Up they rose, And to a spreading beech, whose leafy shield No sun could penetrate, the merry maids Repair delighted. There the table stands; In haste Maria brings a seat for each, And each produces, to amuse the rest, Her work-bag and her basket. Ev'ry tongue Was glib. Maria's self had found a voice, And much she prais'd her friends' more skilful hand, And much excus'd her own. To work they went, And Anna taught her how to toil and please, And give the needle all the painter's art; And much they chatted, and of well-known youths, Some loving, some belov'd, some not esteem'd, In confidence said much; nor shall my Muse Divulge their secret passions to the world. Meantime young Gilbert, by appointment bound, Went to the sea; and to the garden bow'r Walk'd Adriano to reflect alone, And recollect his scatter'd spirits, pleas'd To see his daughter happy with her friends, And much delighted at the loud discourse Under the shady beech. Long time he sat, And meditated now, now read, now wrote, Unwilling to disturb the lively maids: For well he knew that laughter-loving youth Cannot enjoy her story, serious age And reverend experience looking on. Gilbert had reach'd the shore, and found the boat Impatient to be gone, the steady breeze Swelling the bosom of the slacken'd sail; He tarried not, but hastily embark'd, And bade the chiding fisherman begone. Himself assisted, and with ready hand Drew up the anchor, while the sturdy boy Hoisted the sail, and his grave father sat To guide the helm. So from the shore they launch'd, Bound to no port, but destin'd on a cruise, A morning's cruise for fish. Pleas'd was the youth; With utmost joy he saw the wood recede, Beheld his cottage dwindled to a speck, Observ'd the snow-white cliffs to right and left Unfolding their wide barrier to his view, And felt the boat bound gaily o'er the waves, Light as a cork. He took the helm rejoic'd, And right before the wind held on his course Unheeding. 'Twas in vain his busy friends Advis'd a diff'rent course, to gain with ease The shore he left. He carelessly went on, And never dream'd of danger and delay, Never experienc'd. Fast into the waves Sinks the far distant shore. The lofty cliff Stoops to the water, and his hoary brow At ev'ry wave seems buried in the flood. And now the gloomy clouds collect. A storm Comes mutt'ring o'er the deep, and hides the sun. Hush'd is the breeze, and the high-lifted wave, Portending speedy danger, to the shore In lurid silence rolls. In tenfold gloom The stormy south is wrapt, and his grim frown Imparts unusual horror to the deep. Now to the shore too late young Gilbert turns. The breeze is sunk, and o'er the mounting waves Labours the bark in vain. To the stout oar The fisher and his son repair, and pull, Alarm'd for safety, till their flowing brows Trickle with dew. And oft the anxious youth Looks back amaz'd, and sees the lightning play, And hears the thunder, and beholds a sea Ready to burst upon him. Oft he thinks Of Anna and Sophia, and of thee, Much-lov'd Maria, and thy aged sire, Never perhaps again to walk with you, To hear you speak, to live upon your smiles. Ye hapless pair, what shall become of you, No brother to defend you, and no father? But fast the storm increases. The strong flash Incessant gleams upon the curling wave. Round his dark throne in awful majesty The thunder marches; his imperious roar Shakes the proud arch of heav'n. And now the show'r Begins to drop, and the unsteady gust Sweeps to the shore, and stoops the flying boat E'en to the brink. Small distance then, my friends, 'Twixt life and death; a mere hair's breadth. And yet Far, very far, appears the wish'd-for port. And lo! between yon rocks now seen, now lost, Buried in foam, and high the milky surge Rolls its proud cataract along the shore, Access denying. To the frowning cliff Approach not. Mark the strong recoiling wave, E'en to the base of the high precipice It plunges headlong, and the stedfast hill Wears with eternal battery. No bark Of forty times your strength in such a sea Could live a moment. 'Twere enough to wreck A British navy, and her stoutest oak Shiver to atoms. To the faithless beach Fly with all speedâa hurricane pursues. Tempt the loud surge. If life be to be won, Deserve it well; if to be lost, be brave, And yield it hardly. In the garden-bow'r Long time had Adriano sat and mus'd. At length the clouded sun, and falling breeze, That shook no more the whisp'ring poplar's leaf Repose persuading, rous'd him from his seat To view the weather. With sagacious eye He read the gloomy south, and soon perceiv'd The brooding storm. Quick to the maids he walks, And tells of Gilbert's absence, and his wish To tempt that day the ever-restless deep. And lo! a storm advancing. To the shore In great anxiety they haste. His friend Old Adriano lov'd, and much the maids His orphan sisters lov'd him, and as much Lov'd meek Maria. On the beach they stand, And o'er the flouncing surge with stedfast eye Look out. None spies a sail; and much they fear, And much they hope. Of probable delay And alter'd purpose Adriano speaks, And sooths the tim'rous fair, though little hope His bosom entertain'd of Gilbert's safety. He tells them of miraculous escapes, Deliv'rances unthought of, and delays Ordain'd by Providence. At length the storm Grew loud, and double thunder shook the cliff. The lightning glar'd, and shot his fiery fork Hard at the hill. Back to the shelter'd cot Speeds the good man, a maid in either hand; Anna in one, Sophia in the other. Maria ran before. Dark was the wood, And darker still the cottage: it was night Risen at noon. Their scatter'd work they seize, Their chairs and table, and the welcome door Scarce enter ere the heavy show'r descends. A deluge falls, and loud the thunder roars, Jarring the casement. With indignant glare The lightning flashes, and a flood of fire Illumines all the wood. The pow'rful blast Runs howling by the door, and oft they think They hear the crash of the descending elm Torn from its roots, or shatter'd beech, or oak, Smit by the bolt of Heav'n. But most they think Of thee, young Gilbert, on the troubled deep In anguish tost, or buried in the waves, A prey to sharks, or cast upon the beach, No friend to save thee, or thy poor remains Snatch from the flood, and lay them in the earth With decent burial. And much they wept, And many a tear was shed by thy sweet eye, Lovely Maria, to attest thy love, Never before confess'd. For she had lov'd, Much lov'd the gen'rous Gilbert, and she hop'd Ere Adriano died to find a friend, Perhaps a husband. In extreme despair Two hours they past, two long and painful hours. None took refreshment, but the little feast Untasted stood, courting the tongue in vain. At length the storm abates. The furious wind No longer howls. The lightning faintly gleams, And the retiring thunder scarce is heard. The shower ceases, and the glowing sun Bursts from the cloud, and hangs the wood with pearls Fast falling to the ground. On the dark cloud His wat'ry ray impress'd, in brilliant hues Paints the gay rainbow. All is calm and clear. The blackbird sings, and nothing of the storm Is heard, save the grand surge whose heavy fall Sounds awful though remote, and as it sinks With harsh concussion rakes the flinty beach. No longer they delay, but once again Speed to the shore along the sandy path. They come, and lo! the rough tormented deep Boils like a cauldron, like a furnace steams. Who can escape the fury of such wrath? A multitude they meet, who one by one Studiously prowl along the sounding shore, And glean the foamy weed for hidden wreck. And all they ask of Gilbert, but in vain: None saw him, none the fisher or his son. Mournfully slow they travel the rough beach With painful steps, lamenting as they go. Link'd arm in arm went Anna and Maria, And arm in arm a little mile behind Walk'd Adriano and Sophia. He The tender-hearted maid consol'd, and spoke Of grievous accidents which oft befal The innocent and good, and yet require Steady submission and a thankful heart To him who sends them. Sad Maria too Gave grief a tongue, and comforted her friend, Needing relief herself. And thus they walk'd, Till to the foot of the steep cliff they came, And there they saw upon the greensward edge A little rais'd above them one who stood His arms infolded, and the roaring waves With stedfast eye regarded, as they roll'd In foamy storm against the cliff below. Glad they approach'd him, and with gentle voice Anna requested, had he seen a youth Clad thus and thus, a fisher and his son, Or a light boat with painted sides and stern. He heard her not, in admiration lost At the loud conflict of the waves below; Till turning short he saw surpris'd a maid, Whose tearful eye met his, and from whose lips Fell feeble accents to his ear address'd. He ask'd her what she would. She pray'd again, If he had seen a youthâ âFair maid,â said he, âI am a stranger on this boist'rous shore, âAnd known to none. With yester-morning's sun âI left my home, and with a tim'rous friend âSought these high cliffs and that majestic wood, âIn search of some who in this lonely vale, âSuch the report, seek shelter from the world. âTo-day by noon we reach'd the utmost wood, âJust as the storm began. My wary friend âTook refuge at a cottage by the way. âWith him I left my steed, to the white shore âDetermin'd, the wide ocean never seen, âAnd fortune promising, to crown my hopes, âA storm. I came and clomb the cliff, and saw, âIn yonder hovel shelter'd, the wild flood âIn all its fury. With exceeding awe âMingled with joy (for nature in my soul âPut something of the raven, and I love âHer awful operations) I beheld âThe loud tempestuous waters lifted up âProudly terrific, and in foamy pomp âRoll'd thund'ring to the shore. I felt the cliff âShake at their potent onset, while the blast âLifted the hovel's roof, and his strong side, âThough ribb'd with oak, before its fury lean'd. âI saw the fierce and fiery lightning fall âAnd burn along the cliff, e'en at my feet âExpiring. The resounding thunder seem'd âAs heav'n and earth had war, and each enrag'd âIts horrid indignation had roar'd out âClose at my ear. In furious cataract âThe rain descended, as if God was wroth, âAnd heav'n its windows once again had op'd âTo drown the world. I saw the rushing shower âFall on the milk-white head of yon high cliff, âAnd steam along the down and o'er the wood, âAnd ever as the stormy blast blew strong, âAnd the keen lightning shot, it seem'd to fall âIn sheets of fire. Methought the batter'd earth âRock'd to and fro, as with a palsy shook, âProphetic of her end. And then I saw, âScarce saw upon the bounding waves below â(Sad sight, and such as fill'd my soul with grief âAnd terror inexpressible) a ship, âFull of brave sailors, in extreme distress, âToss'd on the rocks. Through all the storm I heard, âOr thought I heard, the lamentable cries âOf fifty souls in the full bloom of life âBegging relief in vain. I saw a wave âSweep half into the flood. The living half âFrantic with terror ran from deck to deck, âWith lifted hands and looks imploring mercy. âSome plung'd into the waves; and one I saw âClasp a distracted female in his arms, âAnd shield her with a father's loveâin vainâ âA larger wave came tumbling o'er the deck, âAnd swept it clear. The parent's hold was lost: âIn the wet shrouds I saw his drowning child âA moment hang, then drop into the waves. âSome yet remain'd high on the rolling mast âIn dreadful expectation rock'd; but soon âThe welt'ring ship was buried, her high mast âFell to the water, and no soul was left. âSoon as the storm subsided I came down, âAnd saw upon the beach the scatter'd wreck âOf what was once a boat. And, as I stood âIn fix'd amaze surveying the wild surge, âI saw the roaring deep cast up the corpse âOf one yet warm with life. E'en at my feet âThe falling water left him, mangled much, âAnd much distorted; yet he seem'd a youth âOf no mean birth, his locks with ribband tied, âHis coat dark blue, his waistcoat neatly wrought, âBuckles of silver in his shoes, his knees âGarter'd with silkââ He said, and to the earth Sunk Anna spiritless. Sophia too, Who unperceiv'd came up, and list'ning stood, And heard the story of the shatter'd boat, And how the corpse was cloth'd, shed bitter tears, And wrung her hands, and lift her eyes to heav'n; Then knelt by Anna, press'd her clay-cold hand, And rais'd her head, and laid her cheek to her's, And call'd, and sigh'd. Maria speechless stood, Pierc'd to the heart. Death o'er her trembling limbs Spread his pale banner, and the spark of life Was half extinguish'd. On her father's neck She fell, and labour'd to conceal her grief Too mighty to be hid. The good man wept. The stranger stood aghast. Humane he was, And shed some few involuntary drops, Not knowing why, and turn'd about to hide them. With gentle hand he help'd to raise the maid, And put the cheering ether to her lip, And touch'd her temples She reviv'd, and sigh'd, And having found her feet, and shed a flood Of pure affection, with a trembling voice, Oft interrupted, of the stranger ask'd, âWhither the corpse was carried.â He replied, âNone saw it but myself, and I alone, âIn pity to a stranger thus expos'd âTo hungry sea-birds and the pitiless boor âWho walks the beach for plunder, rak'd a hole âUnseen of any, and the shroudless corpse âBuried in haste; and came away, well pleas'd âTo have done an office that myself had wish'd âUpon the naked shore so cast.â âBut where, âWhere, Sir,â said Anna, âshall we find the spot âWhere the dear youth lies buried?â âLovely maid,â Replied the stranger, âwith my own rude hands âI smooth'd it as I could, t' escape the search âOf curious plunderers; and scarce had done, âWhen a high-lifted surge with monstrous roar âBurst on the shore, and shot his foamy strength âUp to the topmost beach. I ran before it, âAnd turning could not mark the spot myself âWhere the drown'd youth was laid. Thence up I came, âAnd, when you saw me first, with stedfast eye âWatch'd the approach of something from the wreck, âWhich seem'd another corpse.â âO mighty God!â Cried Anna, âthen these longing eyes no more âShall see our brother, our unhappy Gilbertâ âGilbert!â exclaim'd the stranger all amaz'd, âGilbert! and was it Gilbert whom these hands âInterr'd? and are the maids I see his sisters? âI might have known it, for Sophia's voice âTwice call'd thee Anna, and my conscious heart âLeap'd at the sound. Come, let me both embrace, âAnd be assur'd, the man who thus intrudes âIs a warm friend, who heartily partakes âYour grief for Gilbert.â Silence chain'd his tongue. He said no more, but, Anna's hand in his, Turn'd short aside, and to his flowing eyes Applied the kerchief. In extreme amaze All stood. There was a pause in grief, and joy Was ready with a dewy-raptur'd eye To mingle ecstasy with sorrow. âYes, âA warmer friend,â said he, âthan greets you thus, âNo mortal knows. My name is Frederick! âHa! Frederick! and is it Frederick? âMine and my father's Frederick?â exclaim'd Astonish'd Anna: âby what lucky chance âIn this hard hour do I again embrace âMy faithful Frederick?â She said, and sprung And caught him in her arms, and on his neck Breath'd out in tears unutterable joy, Unutterable grief. âThy Frederick, âThy faithful Frederick, and only thine,â Said he, âis he who holds thee. To this vale âI came in quest of thee, doubly rejoic'd âTo bear good news to Gilbert, and to thee âA heart unchang'd. I mounted not the cliff, âTill I had sought in vain the humble cot âWhere fame reported Gilbert was conceal'd. âYears have elaps'd since at a friend's retreat âI met thee, Anna, lov'd thee, and was lov'd. âOur fathers saw the strong attachment made, âAnd thought it best to separate our hands âTill age had taught us prudence, and our love, âOf childish passion clear, to pure esteem âAnd rational regard had mellow'd down. âYet am I childish still, and in my soul âPerceive no alter'd love, no warmth abated. âFirst in my mind is Anna when I wake, âLast ere I sleep. She is my thought all day, âMy constant dream all night.â âO Frederick, âAnd canst thou,â said she, âto a maid so lost âBe true and faithful? Canst thou love me still, âAll destitute of friends, no father left, âNo brother to defend me? Canst thou grieve âTo see these tears? And shall the same kind roof âReceive Sophia and my wretched self, âNever to part? Take then my hand, and Heav'n âMix no repentance in thy cup.â âDear soul, âCan I?â said he; âinhuman were my heart, âCould I not love thee in the perilous hour, âAs much or more than in the cloudless day âOf gay prosperity. Be thine my roof, âAnd thine, Sophia. All my purse can give âShall purchase happiness for you and me. âCome, let us hasten homeward. By the way âI'll give you short account of better lot âNow intercepted, and to-morrow's fun âShall launch us on the world to live anew.â âStay, gentle stranger,â Adriano cried, Who silently had stood and mark'd his words, And joy'd and griev'd; âa little moment stay. âBe not too hasty to deprive my child âOf these her amiable only friends, âNor pluck from me my second best support âOf age and weakness. Be till night at least âMy guests, and end the melancholy day, âBegun with joy, in my poor shelter'd cot. âTo leave me thus would be a loss indeed. â'Twould break my poor child's heart.â The stranger turn'd, And bow'd obedience, by the tender fair With ease persuaded, in his heart inclin'd To meet the good petition with consent. So silently they went, and Fred'rick told The purpose of his journey. Joyful news He thought to bring to Gilbert and his house. But Providence, who ev'ry ill removes, And gives us only good, by sudden change Had otherwise ordain'd, and what he wills Is best for man. A rich relation died, And left to Gilbert a complete estate. But if he died and left no child behind, It went to Ronsart, an unmanner'd youth, Bred at his mother's knee, the very man Who came with Fred'rick to the lonely wood. Unwelcome was the news, and ev'ry heart Throbb'd with the transports of augmented grief. Sweet comfort fled, and Fred'rick strove in vain To stay the course of unavailing tears. So home they came, in silent sorrow sat, Bread of affliction ate, and drank the cup No longer sweet, unmingled with content. O Grief, thou blessing and thou curse, how fair, How charming art thou, sitting thus in state Upon the eyelid of ingenuous youth, Wat'ring the roses of a healthful cheek With dews of silver! O for Lely's art, To touch the canvass with a tender hand, And give a faithful portrait of thy charms, Seen through the veil of grief, sweet maid, Sophia. O for the pen of Milton, to describe Thy winning sadness, thy subduing sigh, Gentle Maria; to describe thy pains, Assiduous Fred'rick, to alleviate grief, And hang a smile upon thy Anna's brow; To paint the sweet composure of thy looks, Experienc'd Adriano, thy attempt To waken cheerfulness, and frequent eye Stealing aside in pity to Maria. âBe comforted,â he said, and in the sound Was music ev'ry ear was pleas'd to hear. But thy availing voice was not like his, Who bade the deep be still, and it obey'd. A transient gleam of peace one moment shone, But sorrow came the next. Short time they sat, For Fred'rick now bethinks him of his friend, And begs the good man's leave to be excus'd Till early eve, or till he finds at least The roving Ronsart. Well he knew, the youth Was fiery and impatient, and perhaps Might combat danger thus alone, unus'd To win regard by gentle courtesy, In words precipitate and harsh, in deeds Rude and despotic. To partake his walk Anna requested, and he gave consent; Well knowing love has many tales to tell Fit only for the ear of him who loves. So forth they walk'd, and to his weeping child The careful father went. He drew a seat, And sat between Maria and her friend. One hand of each he took, and bade them cease And shed no bitter tears for Gilbert's death, For death was happy. 'Twas a kind reprieve To a sad exile, freedom to a slave, Wealth to a beggar. 'Twas a private door Open'd by Mercy to let in her son, The poor, unhappy, cheated pilgrim, Man, Into the land of rest: that happy land, Once his, but lost, o'er whose fast-bolted gate Insulted Justice waves her fiery sword, And swears no soul shall enter. Yet there was One entrance left, left by that gracious God, Who made the heav'ns and this revolving earth, Who spake, and it was done. He gave the key To Mercy, Mercy was for man. But words Were not sufficient to remove their grief. He paus'dâhe pitied. Gen'rous sympathy Thrill'd in his heart, and mounted to his eyes. He took his hat, and left them with a sigh. Nor sit they long. Each takes a book by chance, Not purposing to read, but steal away And feed the sorrows of her heart alone. Into the wood they went. Sophia turn'd. Maria wander'd on; nor stays her foot, Till to the margin of a brook she comes Swell'd by the morning's rain. Thro' the dark wood Its troubled torrent ran, and falling hoarse From a green bank on little rocks below Made music not ungrateful to her ear. She look'd about, and saw no friend behind. She shut her book, and on a painted bench, Erected long ago by some rude hind Under a poplar's shade that overhung The huddling brook, she sat her down, and sobb'd Till sorrow had its fill; then wip'd her eyes, And lean'd her arm against the poplar's bark, Her head against her arm. The other hand Held fast the book and tear-dipt handkerchief. She look'd upon the brook, and mus'd awhile, Watching the bubbles as they rose and burst. At length persuasive rest her eyelids clos'd, And all in graceful negligence reclin'd She slept, if sleep it may be call'd, that fill'd Her troubled mind with images of woe And death. Meanwhile in sad and thoughtful mood Thrice round his garden Adriano walk'd. He shook the drooping lilac, rais'd the pea, Supported the gay stock, and brush'd the dew From the full budded pink. With tender hand Maria's shelter'd flower-pots he cheer'd, Removing aught might hurt the cautious bud Of balsams, myrtles, roses, or the plant So finely sensitive. At length he turns, And seeks the maids he left, but finds them not. Deserted was the cottage, only Frisk, For ever faithful, at the threshold slept. Wide open stood the door, and seem'd to tell Whither the maids were gone. He drew it to, And, Frisk before him, sought the custom'd walk Through the dark wood. Sophia soon he saw (Her book was open, but she read it not) In thoughtful posture now, now walking brisk, And now in warm distress looking to heav'n, The tears fast falling down her fluster'd cheek. âWhat reads my child?â he cried; âsome tender âtale âOf virtuous suff'ring?â Startled at the voice, She shut her book, and wiping her warm cheek Put it away disorder'd. âLet me see,â Said Adriano kindly; âlet me see âWhat tale has pow'r to wring exhausted grief âTo such a flood of woe!â He seiz'd the book, And found it Werter's Sorrows. âAye, my child, âA wretched tale, but not to be believ'd. âO pestilent example, to describe âAs worthy pity and the fair one's tears âDeeds by no arguments to be excus'd. âWho kills himself, involves him in the guilt âOf foulest murder. True, no written law âCommands our strict forbearance; but be sure âThe laws of nature are the laws of God; âAnd he, who said Thou shalt not murder, made âThis universal law that binds our hands âFrom mischief to ourselves. Else why so strong âThe love of being and the fear of death? âWhy stands the tortur'd sick on the grave's brink, âAnd trembles to step in? Why linger I, âAssur'd that nothing painful waits me there? â'Tis God's decree engrav'd upon the heart âTo make us wait with patience, till he comes, âUndraws the curtain, and dispels the gloom, âAnd takes us to his bosom, and rewards âOur constancy and truth. That mortal then, âWho shuns the suff'rance of impending ills, âIs cowardly and rash. For what more rash âThan wilfully to spoil a noble work âGod made, and said, let live? What more betrays âRank cowardice, than tim'rously to shake âAnd fly distracted at a foe's approach? âCan there be aught more painful, than to lose âAn amiable wife? in one short hour âTo fall from affluence and joy and peace, âTo poverty and grief? Can there be felt âHeavier misfortune, than to lose a son, âAnd find myself a beggar at his death; âForc'd into solitude without a friend, âAnd only one poor little weeping child âTo be the sad companion of my grief? âYet am I living still, and kiss the hand âThat smote me so severely. Tell me not âThat life has pains too heavy to support. âLook towards Calvary, and learn from thence âThe noblest fortitude is still to bear âAccumulated ills, and never faint. âWe may avoid them, if we can with honour; âBut, God requiring, let weak man submit, âAnd drink the bitter draught, and not repine. âHad Cato been a Christian, he had died âBy inches, rather than have ta'en the sword âAnd fall'n unlike his master.â âYes, good Sir,â Answer'd Sophia, with a downcast eye, Turning the leaves, âand he, who feels like me, âWould sooner bear all human woes in one, âThan fly to death for succour, and destroy âA parent's peace for life.â â'Tis justly said,â Cried Adriano, at the pious thought Touch'd with affection, âand the man who dies, âProvok'd to madness by adult'rous love, âIgnobly dies. A more disgraceful end âNo sentence could inflict. âAnd she who loves,â Replied Sophia, âand divides her heart, âGiving it not entire to him she weds, âDeserves no pity, suffer what she will.â âDoubtlessâ said he: âO it delights me much âTo find such sense in woman, she can see âThe fatal tendency of tales like these. â'Tis thus the arch deceiver, busy still âTo ruin man, besets the female heart, âInsinuates evil counsel, and inflames âThe hungry passions, that like arid flax âCatch at a spark, and mount into a blaze. âThe passions heated, reason strives in vain; âHer empire's lost, and the distracted soul âBecomes the sport of devils, wholly bent âTo turn and wind it in a world of sin.â â'Twere dang'rous then,â cried she, âhowever good, âTo trust our judgment in a tale like this?â âDang'rous indeed,â said he; âfor what young maid âCan so distinguish between good and ill, âAs not to love and practise both alike, âWhen both are painted lovely? Trust me, child, âThere lurks a serpent in this flow'ry path âShall sting thee to the quick. Better desist, âAnd enter not at all, than be seduc'd âBy its best fruits, till appetite increase, âAnd step by step the cautious foot advance, âTill no return be found. The thirsty tongue âMay taste the spring it nauseates and abhors, âTill custom makes it sweet. And frequent use âMay so befool the sense, to make it long, âAnd drain the cup, and drink the pois'nous dregs, âRather than quit it for the draught of health.â âIf then,â rejoin'd Sophia, âtales like these âOught never to attract a female's eye, âTell me, good Sir, for I have long'd to ask, âWhat shall we read?â âWhat read, my child?â said he, âRead thy Creator in his word and works. âFollow Philosophy, and hear her speak âOf other peopled worlds, and other suns âEnlight'ning worlds unheard of. See her draw âThe ample circle, and describe the laws âOf this our little universe, which lies âWithin the ken of our assisted eye. âBe with her when she turns the spotted globe, âAnd shews the cause of seasons, day and night, âIn equal portions dealt to all mankind. âAttend her to the field, with studious eye âClosely examining whate'er she sees. âHear her discourse of wisdom in the brute, âThe fish, the fowl, the insect, plant and flow'r, âIn ev'ry particle alive or dead, âFrom the cloud-cover'd mountain's highest peak âDown to the center. Follow History, âAnd hear her justify the ways of God, âRequiting evil, and rewarding good, âAnd holding up to honour and esteem âThe great example. Follow Poetry, âAnd mark her epic song and tragic act, âAnd only leave her when indecent mirth âTurns wit to madness. I could tell thee, child, âWould time permit, a thousand wholesome paths, âWhere profit only with amusement dwells, âAnd where no danger lurks. Be such as Grey, âOr More's attentive daughter. From his lips âA family grew wife, and ev'ry ear âDrank pure instruction. Like a summer sun âOn all about him his benignant ray âShed happy influence, and ev'ry child, âImprov'd and cherish'd by the glowing beam, âShone like a planet. Chiefly she the first, âThe morning star, how exquisite her charms, âFor ever near and dancing in his smiles, âAnd shining most the parent orb eclips'd. âBe such as Bacon's mother, skill'd to rear âHer infant prodigy; or such as she âThe gallant Sidney's sister, learn'd and good, âWhose like ere death shall kill, expiring time âShall throw a dart at him, and shut the grave. âLearn by what arts ingenious Packington âTo lasting honour rose; how Masham won âLocke's just regard; how pious Norton's child âIn early greatness died; how Astell shone âThe glory of her age. Seek these, my child, âAnd let none go beyond thee. To excel âBe all thy wish at morning, noon, and night. âBut shun the flow'ry path where no good dwells, âAnd guard thy virtue as a precious gem âMuch envied and soon lost. Another time, âIf yet the wood, the cottage, and the down âHave charms to stay thee, Gilbert gone for ever, âI will instruct thee farther. Live with me, âAnd be Maria's friend, and eat my bread, âAnd be my second daughter.â âThanks, good Sir,â Sophia said, and in one modest look Convey'd such gratitude as angels feel In the great world above. And now again Grief swell'd her heart, and tears ran down her cheek. âCome,â said the careful father, âweep no more. âGo to the cot, ere chilly ev'ning come, âAnd the damp wood affect thee. Where's my daughter?â Under a poplar's shade that overhung The noisy brook, upon a painted bench, Maria sat and slept. But scarce her eyes Had clos'd, when Ronsart, looking for his friend, And angry to be left so long alone, Came scowling to the spot. He saw the maid, And stood a moment in amazement lost. His anger ceas'd, and pleasure in its stead Sat on his brow exulting. So retreats The morning cloud before the rising sun, And day that louring wak'd forbears her frown, And softens to a smile. Nearer the maid He drew, enraptur'd with her charms. He gaz'd, And all the villain came into his heart. He long'd, and yet he fear'd to touch. For vice Is ever aw'd at goodness, and begins Her treach'rous act with fear and doubt, asham'd To see herself so base, and of her prey Inly despairing, since no pow'r can force Strong Heav'n, no strength withstand his fiery arm Who fights for virtue. With a trembling hand He stole the book and readâhe drew away And kiss'd her handkerchief, and touch'd her hand. So plays the hungry tiger with his prey, Whetting his appetite by long restraint. She mov'd, and sigh'd. He throbb'd with expectation, And ready stood to catch her in his arms Soon as her eye-lids rose. She slept again. He sat beside her, and with curious eye Survey'd her, as he thought, all unobserv'd: But close behind him, by a tree conceal'd, Stood one in rustic habit clad, and watch'd His guilty motions. To the brook he came, And saw the maid asleep. Just then he heard The steps of Ronsart, and withdrew unseen. So when at last th' impatient youth arose, And wak'd the maid, and seiz'd her in his arms, And thought him of his wicked act secure, Ere he could fix his longing lips on hers, He aim'd a blow at the young villain's head, That fell'd him to the earth. 'Twas Gilbert! Struck With terror and amaze Maria fled, But knew 'twas Gilbert. To her sire she came Just parting from Sophia, out of breath, And so disorder'd between smiles and tears, She found no tongue. She took Sophia's hand, And led her trembling to the brook. They ran, And Adriano follow'd. Ere they came Ronsart had risen, and in furious wrath High-menacing at Gilbert ran. His voice Drew Fred'rick and his Anna to the spot, Returning home wearied with fruitless search. They came in time to see a second blow Drive Ronsart back, and plunge him in the brook. Then came Sophia and the injur'd maid, And Adriano. Fred'rick was enrag'd; He seiz'd the collar of the man unknown, And had not seiz'd in vain, but Anna saw And knew her brother, fair Sophia saw And knew him. All were satisfied 'twas Gilbert. So eagerly they ran and kiss'd his cheek, And hung upon his neck, and wept for joy. And he wept too, and tenderly caress'd Thee, dear Maria, and thy breaking heart Fill'd full with consolation. Then he turn'd, And with austere regard on Fred'rick look'd, Who statue-like in blank astonishment Stood fix'd, and sternly ask'd him, âwhat he would Speedy as lightning Anna ran between, And cried, â'Tis Frederick!â âIt matters not,â Said Gilbert, âwho it is. The man who thus âSeizes my throat, must shew me ample cause, âOr I shall call him to a sharp account, âThough he be Fred'rick my much-honour'd friend.â âWho sees his friend,â cried Fred'rick, âthus abus'd, âBeat to the earth, and wallow'd in the brook, âAnd gives him no assistance, is a coward. âLet him who injur'd Ronsart shew me cause, âOr I shall call him to a sharp account, âThough he be Gilbert my much-honour'd friend. âThen hear,â said Gilbert. âTo this spot I came, âIntending hurt to none. From the loud surge âBut ill escap'd, and climbing the rude cliff âThrough a steep moulder'd gap, at a small hut âBelonging to the fisher and his son, âI found this suit, and chang'd it for my own âAll dripping wet. Soon as the tempest ceas'd âI left the hut thus clad, and tow'rds the wood âCame with all speed, well knowing these my friends âAnd these my sisters had not hearts of steel, âAnd might be griev'd at my delay. I saw, âJust as my weary feet had reach'd this spot, âThis lovely maid upon that bench asleep. âI saw, and was refresh'd; but had not gaz'd âA moment's space, ere yonder villain came, âThy friend; and I retir'd, and unperceiv'd âBeheld the dev'lish antic at his wiles. âI knew his purpose, (for the outward act âGives true assurance of the inward mind,) âAnd burning with impatience stood awhile, âTill he all passion seiz'd the helpless maid âAlone and sleeping, and with touch profane âThought to have feasted on those crimson lips âAnd that vermilion cheek. I sprung to help her âAnd sure my arm had more than usual strength, âFor with one blow I fell'd him to the earth, âAnd set the captive free. She fled alarm'd, âAnd hardly stay'd to cast one thankful look âOn him who sav'd herâbut that gracious smile âRepays me well. The shameless villain rose, âAnd, cursing me by ev'ry name above, âRan at my life. The second blow you saw, âWhich plung'd him headlong in the miry brook. âAnd if an act like this can need defence, âI stand prepar'd to give it; for be sure, âHad it been Fred'rick I had done the same, âAnd Fred'rick had deserv'd it.â âYes, and more,â Cried Fred'rick, at his guilty friend incens'd: âGive me thy pardon, and chastise the boy âTill double recompence atone the wrong. âMy arm shall lend assistance.â âNo, my friend,â Said Gilbert, âlet him stand aloof, while thus âWe join our hands in friendship. If he dares âAgain to break the peace of this calm wood, âAgain my arm shall teach him to be just.â âThy arm shall teach me, ignominious boy!â Ronsart replied, and haughtily advanc'd: âO Fred'rick, I'm astonish'd thy cold ear âCan drink a tale so false. 'Tis all a lie. âHis was the purpose to assault the maid, âAnd mine to shield her. By these hazels hid, âI saw the villain to the bench advance, âAnd offer violence. My heart was hot, âAnd 'gainst my brave attempt to combat force âAnd rescue innocence, his arm prevail'd. âBut think not, Gilbert, to escape me thus. âIf there be courage in thee, and these rags âCover no coward's heart, in half an hour âMeet me again. This be the spot, and come âPrepar'd for measures that may best acquit âMy injur'd honour.â âYes,â said Fred'rick, â'tis, â'Tis all a lie. Thy purposes, no doubt, âWere fair and good. Look at the injur'd maid; âThe frown of indignation cast on thee, âThe smile bestow'd on Gilbert, are strong proofs âThine is the cause of justice and of truth. âThy fury shews thee honest, and thy wrongs âCloth'd in the modest style of injur'd worth âBespeak a friend's compassion. I rejoice âGilbert yet lives to disappoint thy hopes, âThou man of honour; to reward thy deeds, âThou man of courage. In my soul I loath âThe wretch who dares be wicked, yet complains âOf injur'd honour, and defends his act âWith specious lies and seeming honesty. âO Gilbert, let me give thee double joy, âEscap'd the troublous ocean, and restor'd âTo these and me. We thought the roaring surge âHad wreck'd thy bark and cast thee up, and I, âIn pity to a mangled corpse unknown, âHad given thee hasty burial in the beach. âIt griev'd me much, for to the wood I came âWith joyful news. The wealthy Rowley dead âGives thee his whole estate. Enjoy it long, âAnd be the father of a num'rous race, âAnd Ronsart's second hope prevented thus âRemain unsatisfied for ever. Come, âLet us be gone, and leave the valiant boy âTo meditate at leisure. He may find âA surer way to honour, than to lurk, âAnd offer insult to a sleeping maid, âTo menace her protector, and demand âStrict satisfaction, when no head but his âDeserves the stroke of justice.â Gilbert stood With thoughtful brow revolving in his mind Old Rowley's goodness, cheerful now, now grave. In doubt was he, or to accept his lot, Or love the cottage still. Of the wide world He little knew, nor much had seen to blame; And novelty had charms to win his heart. But here Maria dwelt; and what was wealth, Or what was life, without her? His distress Good Adriano saw, and mark'd his eye Oft turning to Maria. âWhy,â said he, âStands Gilbert falt'ring thus, the only soul âThat not rejoices at his own good lot?â â'Tis strange indeed,â said Gilbert; âbut my mind âIs doubtful of its choice. On either hand âA happy lot invites me, and to each âMy wav'ring heart inclines. Here stands the world, âAnd with a fascinating smile attracts, âAnd talks of duties between man and man, âOf laurels to be won and praise deserv'd âBy public service. Sweet retirement there âShews me her boundless treasures, bids me drink âAt her eternal fountain of delights, âAnd rove, and read, and prattle to my friends âIn the fine ease of unmolested life. âAnd how shall I forsake the sunny down, âHow leave the shady wood, the cot and thee, âAnd dear Maria? Who shall guard her then âFrom the sly lurking villain?â âFear thou not,â Said Adriano smiling, âlet us live âUnheard of still. There is a God above, âWho loves the good, and guards them from all ills; âAnd he shall lend me, to protect my child, âA shield of adamant. Go seek the world, âShine in the public eye. Be great and good. âEmploy thy talents to a noble end, âAnd pay them back with int'rest. Other downs, âAnd other woods, and other smiling friends, âAnd other mansions shall delight thee there. âForget Maria and her father's cell, âAnd live with men, and feast thy ear with mirth, âThy eye with beauty.â âNever,â cries the youth, âO never, never. Let me sooner die âThan leave the friends I love. I cannot quit âThe shady cottage and the sunny down, âThese many years remember'd, often sought âAt morning and at eve. My native soil, âI cannot leave thee; how much less my friends, âThee Adriano, and thy duteous child âMaria! Give me her, and to the world âI go rejoicing, for I must confess âI love her much.â âI know thou lov'st her much,â Said Adriano, âand thou didst enough âWell to deserve her heart. But how shall I âSupport the absence of an only child, âScarce able now to live, by her good hand âSustain'd and cherish'd?â âBe together still,â Cried Gilbert warmly, âand my house thy home. âWhat says Maria?â On the ground were fix'd Her modest eyes, and downcast was her head. She smooth'd her apron's hem, and smil'd aside, And lovely blushes wav'd upon her cheek. She look'd at Adriano for his leave, And gave her hand to Gilbert. Her meek eye Met his transported, and a look of love Shot to his heart. He kiss'd her glowing cheek, And Adriano smil'd. The happy sign Maria saw, and fell upon his neck. And, âO Maria, my dear child,â he said, âThis was the happy hour I long'd to see. âMy daughter wedded to a worthy youth âWho so deserves her, fills my heart with joy. âI ask no more; kind Heav'n has fully paid âFor all my former pains. Be happy these, âI leave the world in peace, content to die, âAnd go to her whose loss these eyes have wept âThese twenty years. Maria, love thy husband. âBe kind to him as thou wast kind to me, âAnd he shall love thee with as perfect love. âA few short days, perhaps, and I am gone; âMy office is expir'd, and what can I âTo be of service more?â âCome, come,â said Gilbert, âLive and rejoice with us. A few short years âOf the best happiness this world affords âShall not o'erpay thee for thy daily care âTo rear this lovely maid. Great was the gift, âAnd pure is the esteem that gift has won. âOh! my heart longs to shew thee what it owes, âAnd make thy happiness complete as mine. âTo-morrow let us hence. Another day âShall make Maria mine. I cannot rest âTill I have shewn to an admiring world âHow fair a rose has in the desert sprung.â O ye mistaken belles, who fondly think 'Tis prudent to engage the public eye Ere infancy expire; to lead the dance; Parade the public walk and crowded street, Prate to the grinning coxcomb, and engage The eager ears of an assembled rout All hungry to devour your pert remark; To scream at the full concert unabash'd, And foremost sit in the projecting box, Till the fine blush forsakes you; learn from hence, Who quits her modesty foregoes a grace Which nothing can compensate. The fix'd blush, Or true or borrow'd, has few charms for man. Be all the morning's beauty on thy cheek, It shall not win me if it ne'er retire And come again, by just occasion call'd. Be all the ev'ning's splendor in thy eye, It shall not please me if the stubborn lid In sweet abashment never fall. Peruse All living nature; what but modesty Pervades the heav'ns above and earth beneath? The mighty Author of the world, whose hand Creates all beauty, flies before the search. We see the traces of his glorious art, But seek the finger that performs in vain. In darkness and in clouds he wraps him up, Withdraws, and only wishes to be seen In these his works; though beautiful, no doubt, The source of so much beauty, beyond thought Engaging to the eye and ev'ry sense, That presence he denies. O modesty, Beyond example charming! In his word, And him the pattern of his Father's deeds Assuming poverty to hide the God, Read him still modest; and retreating still, Though still pursued. He yet remains unseen, Though on the footstool of his throne we stand, And feel all God about us. Hence, ye fair, Learn to esteem the godlike gift, and meet The public eye with caution, lest the blush, By constant admiration put to flight, Disdain to come again, and all the charms Which Nature gave you to engage our hearts Be gone, and leave you with no power to please. Gilbert was marching with Maria's arm Fast lock'd in his, when Adriano spoke. âStay, Gilbert, pause awhile, and ere we go âAnother match approve. This worthy youth â(For such I deem him, tho' not known a day) âHas giv'n his heart to Anna, she to him. âWhile yet we thought thee lost, she told her love, âAll destitute of friends; and nobly he âResolv'd to love her in the hour of need, âAs much or more than in the cloudless day âOf gay prosperity. The same kind roof âWas to receive Sophia and herself, âNever to part.â âO admirable friend! âThe friend in need,â said Gilbert, âis a friend âNo bounty can repay.â He took their hands And join'd them, and a thousand blessings gave; He wish'd them health, and peace, and long to live, As happy as Maria and himself. Then all were cheerful, and the kiss of love Went round. Good humour sat on ev'ry cheek, And ev'ry eye was merry. The clear moon Rose on the wood, and disappearing half Under the border of a sable cloud, Hung like a drop of gold. The pleasing sight All saw delighted, Adriano most, Who first perceiv'd the silent orb had ris'n, And ev'ning stol'n upon them. With gay heart He summons to the cottage, there to sit, To eat, to drink, and while away an hour Before they rest. Young Ronsart then he saw, And felt compassion for the thoughtless youth. He bade the rest retire; but Fred'rick stay'd, Left aught might prompt the hasty boy to rage, And Adriano's care be ill repaid By insolence and anger. To the youth The good man went. In proud disdain he turn'd, And with harsh finger pluck'd the hazel's leaf; When Adriano thus: âCome, honest youth, âMistake us not for foes. Partake our cheer. âThe smart of folly felt, we ask no more. âBe wise in future. 'Tis a pow'rful hand âProtects the good; provoke its wrath no more. âBe happy with us, for my child forgives âThe purpos'd injury, assur'd like me âThy gen'rous nature in the hour of thought âWill feel contrition. Harbour no revenge; âFor Gilbert's anger justly was provok'd. âThink, hadst thou seen a maid by thee belov'd, âAlone thus sleeping, and a stranger came, âWith eagerness approach'd, and seiz'd her hand, âAnd caught her in his arms, tho' all he wish'd âWas but a kiss, how had thy fury burn'd! âWho could forbear and look in patience on, âTo see another's arm infold the fair âHe deems his own? Be satisfied, nor think âGilbert has done thee wrong. Provoke him not âTo meet thee in the field, for such an act âWere base in him and thee. 'Twere like the wretch âWho call'd his righteous brother to account, âAnd slew him for his virtue. 'Twere in both âStrange violation of the law divine, âTo follow custom, which too often leads âTo terrible mistake. The rich and great âAdopting folly, to the gen'ral eye âMake vice seem innocent. So here their use âApproves stupendous error, and the mean, âEager to imitate their words and deeds, âAdopt an act that will not bear excuse. âThink as ye will of virtue, O ye great, â'Tis your's to recommend the faith ye own âBy virtuous conduct. Ev'ry soul that fails, âBy your infectious fashions led astray, âShall at your hands his happiness require.â âAye, sir,â said Fred'rick, âand 'twere well the âgreat âHad something of the honest Briton left, âAnd scorn'd to ape the manners of the French. âI hate to see such senseless def'rence paid âTo a designing foe. Let the fop's coat âBe made at Paris, let his locks be teaz'd âAll day by the frizeur, and let him walk âWith hat in hand on tiptoe to the ball âAll flattery and essence. Butterflies âMake summer cheerful, and such powder'd moths âServe for the wise to laugh at. But be sure âOur native virtue will instruct us best âHow and for what to fight. Or if that fail, âAppeal we to the Roman and the Greek. âTheir swords were only drawn for public wrongs, âAnd never clash'd but in the state's defence. âCÃ¦sar was brave, and CÃ¦sar had his foes; âBut when drew CÃ¦sar blood but in the field? âHis private quarrels to the winds he tost, âForgot his injuries, and only slew âContending for his country.â âTruly said,â Cried Adriano, âand the man who thinks âWill act like CÃ¦sar, for no public good âCan flow from private vengeance. 'Tis our part, âAs Christians, to forget the wrongs we feel, âTo pardon trespasses, our very foes âTo love and cherish, to do good to all, âLive peaceably, and not avenge ourselves. âAnd he who, spite of duty, fights and falls, âRuns on the sword, and is his own assassin. âWho sheds another's blood is guilty murder; âNo matter what the cause, for hear the law. âWho sheds man's blood, by man his blood be shed Gen. ix. 5.. âE'en of the beast will I require man's life. âWho kills his neighbour, be it with design, âWhether they strive or not, he surely dies. âStrike with a stone, with iron, or with wood Exod. xxi. Numb. xxxv. âOr only with the hand, if life be lost, â'Tis death. The land defil'd by blood is cleans'd âBut by his blood who shed it.â Think of this, âMy hasty friend, and let an old man's words âSink deep into thy heart. I had a son, âWho fell an early victim to the sword, â(May God forgive him!) and it grieves my soul âTo find the times so thoughtless, they have lost âAll sense of virtue. 'Tis a grievous sight â Bacon.To see brave youths of towardness and hope, âSons of the morning, cast away and lost, âShort-liv'd and transient as the meadow-flow'rs âBefore the mower's scythe; to see their blood âIgnobly shed, whose efforts might have won âA day of glory, and preserv'd a state. âWas Sidney such? was Wolfe? was Manners? These âAre Britain's boast, the noblest ornaments âThat grace the story of our happy isle.â âAnd what,â said Fred'rick, âis the cause assign'd âTo vindicate the duel? Is it wrong, âIntolerable wrong? Then seek the law; âLet public justice in her even scales âWeigh the vast injury, and fix the price âShall recompense th' affront. The private eye âSees double for itself, and to the foe âAllows no merit. Is the cause so small âThe law o'erlooks it? Then a gen'rous mind âShould scorn a recompense.â âThe noble soul,â Said Adriano, âlike a summer sea, âIs not to be disturb'd by ev'ry breath. âIt stands above weak insult, like an Alp, âThat hides its sunny forehead in the sky, âAnd scorns the pelting of the storm below. âTrue courage seldom stoops to weigh a word. âThe blow not always moves it, and it strikes âThen only, when the gen'ral good requires. âIt feels that life and all we have is due âTo them we serve, our country and our God. âWhen these command, it dares oppose all ill; âBut deems it neither honest, just, nor brave, âTo combat danger, when they both forbid. âIt guards its station with a watchful eye, âWilling to act, or patient to forbear, âAs duty gives the word. For well it knows, âTrue magnanimity is so to live âAs never to infringe the laws of God, âOr break the public peace. Let the shrill tongue âOf defamation prate, and her loud rout âDecree a coward's name to him who hears âThe lie unmov'd, and will not dare to fight âE'en for a blow. 'Tis fortitude to bear; âAnd he who cannot bear, but stakes his life âTo win the praises of a herd like this, âWho hardly know a virtue from a vice, âAnd leaves the approbation of his God, âHis country, and a conscience free from guilt, âWhat is he but a coward? He prefers âThe poor applause of women and of fools, âTo inward peace and everlasting joy; âAfraid to combat with the world's disgrace, âWhich gives no torment to a wife man's heart, âLasts but a day, and with to-morrow's sun âGoes down and is forgot.â âO I abhor,â Said Fred'rick hastily, âthe moody shout âOf popular applause, which falls by chance âOn virtue or on vice, and not discerns âThe better claim of the devout and good. âFor all the praises of a world like this âWho would be great? Give me a thousand tomes âOf such applause, I'll tear 'em piece by piece, âAnd trample all my honour in the dust. âIs there a man whose judgment is exact? âTo earn his praise I'd climb the arduous top âOf burning Ãtna, were it thrice as high âAs yon bright moon, and one eternal snow âTo the last foot; I'd dive into the deep; âI'd dig down to the center of the earth; âI'd take the eagle's wings, and mount the skies, âAnd follow virtue to her seat in heaven.â âAye, gen'rous youth,â said Adriano pleas'd, â'Tis noble to deserve the wise man's praise. âSuch is the man of honour. Only he âIs great and hon'rable, who fears the breach âOf laws divine or human, and foregoes âE'en reputation rather than infringe âThe Christian's duty. 'Tis the devil's art âTo varnish folly, and give vice a mask âTo make her look like virtue. Thus to fight, âTo murder and be murder'd, tho' the cause âWould hardly justify a moment's wrath, âIs honour, glorious honour. Vulgar eyes âMistake the semblance, and the specious vice âPasses for sterling virtue. But take heed, âIngenuous youth, and let th' impostor pass. âScorn the applause of a misguided mob, âDespise their censures. Can that ear be judge âOf the musician's merit, whose base sense âCan scarce prefer immortal Handel's notes âTo the harsh brayings of a pester'd ass? âCan that eye judge of beauty and desert, âWhich scarce distinguishes the sign-post daub âFrom the great painter, whose ingenious hand âTouches the canvass with a poet's fire? âThen why permit them to prescribe the bounds âOf courage and of honour? Be assur'd âThe joint applause of twenty million such âConfers no dignity. 'Tis nobler far âTo bear the lash of slander, and be stil'd âScoundrel and coward with a mind at ease, âSure to be honour'd by the great above, âTho' slighted by the little here. Be first, âYe men of place and fashion, on whose deeds âThe vulgar eye for ever is intent, âTheir very garments modeling from youâ âBe first to recommend a steady mind, âSerene and patient, by no wrongs provok'd âTo thirst for blood. An ornament it is âShall give you greatness in an angel's eyes, âShall raise you all to thrones no pow'r can shake, âFor ever honour'd and for ever lov'd.â He said, and scarce had ended, when the sound Of footsteps nimbly pacing reach'd his ear. The hazels rustled, and with cheerful smile Sophia from the shade emerg'd. The moon Shone full upon her, and her mellow beams Improv'd a countenance serene as her's. She seem'd an angel stepping from the clouds With happiness for man: âAnd why,â she said, âWhy do you loiter here? O we have long'd, âHave long'd to see you. We have danc'd an age, âAnd wish'd for you to help. Come, Sir, and see âHow gracefully Maria leads the dance. âShe's life itself. I never saw a foot âSo nimble and so eloquent. It speaks, âAnd the sweet whisp'ring poetry it makes âShames the musician. Fred'rick come, be quick, âFor Anna waits, and waits with patience yet.â âStay but a moment,â Adriano cried; âFor here is one it grieves me to dismiss.â â O let him join us!â said the cheerful maid; âMaria charg'd me to forgive him. She âCan bear no malice. And do you forgive; âI know you to be good, and I engage âTo be his partner in the dance.â She said. The good man solemnly forgave. The youth Felt true compunction, and his fault excus'd With shame and tears. Then Fred'rick took his hand, In transport home they went, and Ronsart dress'd, And Adriano led him to the room. Much shame he felt; but the good man was kind, And interceded, and they all forgave. Gilbert shook hands, and ev'ry maid was pleas'd. Sophia pitied her embarrass'd swain, And swept her fingers o'er the loud guitar Provoking to the dance. The fiddler heard, And tun'd his strings, and 'gan a lively air. Then Gilbert seiz'd again Maria's hand, And led her to the top; then Fred'rick ran, And Anna bounded to receive his hand: Good Adriano rested, Ronsart rose, And kind Sophia beckon'd with a smile. So merrily they danc'd one speedy hour Ere the last meal began. At length they ceas'd. Then much they chatted, and as much they sang, Each by his partner seated. To delight Was ev'ry fair one's wish, and ev'ry youth's, And all were pleas'd. E'en Adriano's eye Sparkled with honest joy, tho' seventy years Had somewhat dimm'd its lustre; and his cheek Shew'd yet some traces of the youthful blush, Warm'd by the hearty laugh. At length the clock Sounded the midnight hour, and up they rose. Each to his home retreats, engag'd to rise And meet his charmer by the morning dawn At Adriano's door. To the lone cot, Never so long deserted, Gilbert hastes, In either hand a sister. To the inn (If such the village-hovel may be call'd, Where the high-lifted bush, well understood, Alone proclaims âGood entertainment here âFor man and horseâ) speeds Fred'rick and his friend, With high commissions charg'd. To her own room, With blessings loaded by her joyous sire, And pure affection's thrice-repeated kiss, Withdrew Maria, happy as a cherub. He slept in peace, but scarce one short-liv'd hour Her watchful eye-lids clos'd. Excessive joy Burn'd on her cheek and bounded in her heart. Nor car'd she much for sleep, while certain bliss Gave ease to vigilance, but envious sleep Cheated her fancy with a thousand dreams Of Gilbert struggling with the furious waves, And asking life in vain. At length day rose, Wak'd by the lark, and from her bed she sprung. The early breakfast she prepar'd, herself Attir'd, and wak'd her father. Scarce had he Forsook his chamber, when the hasty rap Announc'd young Gilbert and his sisters. Joy Maria's cheek suffus'd, and with glad heart Her friends she welcom'd, chiefly thee, fond youth, For six long hours (O what an age in love!) Not seen or heard. And now the sounding hoofs Of steeds quick-pacing echo through the wood. The frequent lash resounds, and the brisk wheel Runs lightly clatt'ring o'er the velvet sward. Soon to the door came Fred'rick and his friend. Each in his chaise with looks of gladness sat. One horse drove each, another led behind. They hail their happy friends, and now descend, And all are seated at the cheerful board. Not long they sat, impatient to be gone. The door is fasten'd, Adriano mounts, And Gilbert at his right hand holds the whip; Maria sits between. His Anna's arm Fred'rick supports, and lifts her to her seat, Then follows after. Ronsart's willing hand Sophia's foot sustains, and to her throne Upon the prancing steed the neatly springs, Light as the climbing vapour. Proud is he To be so mounted, and his silver bit Haughtily champs, and shakes his flowing mane, And paws the earth. Then Ronsart strode his steed; Young Gilbert's whip the sounding signal gave, And all departed. One desirous look Back on the lonely cot Maria cast, And shed a tear at parting. Due regret Good Adriano felt, and his moist eye And fault'ring tongue confess'd the swelling heart Unwillingly betray'd. Ah! they are gone. Deserted roof, O how shall I forsake Thee the best ornament my song can boast, Parent of happiness that seldom fail'd, Source of sweet peace, that never ceas'd, and fled But to return with transport. Who shall lead The vine's luxuriant branch and purple fruit About thy casements now? Who shall regard The creeping ivy round thy chimney wound, And o'er they thatch in dark profusion spread? Who shall invite the oak's umbrageous arm? Who shall frequent the beech, and on the bench Under his wholesome shade sweet lectures read, To guide his offspring in the ways of truth? Who shall improve thy bow'r, and turn thy soil, Who prune thy fruit-trees, and protect thy flow'rs, Who weed the gravel at thy door? All this Will I?O undisturb'd retreat, thy still, Thy secret pleasures shall be all I ask, Shut out for ever from the noise of men. But thou art dumbâthy books, thy walks, thy views, Have no sweet voice to captivate my ear. Thy music does not speak. I smile indeed, And see thee smile again; but all thy sounds Are but the feeble echoes of my own. My ear is hungry and my eye athirst For her whom Adam, earth's primeval lord, Found wanting never seen, and without whom E'en Paradise was painful. Let me feast On the sweet tones of melody and sense In soft persuasion dropping from the tongue Of lovely woman; let me drink her smiles, The beverage of love, and from her eye See my own joy reflected, and thence doubled. Without her all thy charms, forsaken cot, Court me in vain. Adieu then, humble roof, Not to be sought, since not to be enjoy'd Alone. A little longer with the world I mix; a little longer hear the shout Of clam'rous, factious, discontended man; A little longer bear the beldam's frown, The hiss of slander, and the sneer of pride. Then shall thy door receive me, never more To quit thy peaceful shadows, till kind Heav'n, With her the sole sweet partner of my joys, Transplant me (of indulgence not deserv'd) Into a world where charity abounds, And love shall live for ever and for ever. So sang the poet, and with speedy step Went forward to the world. He sought the church, And saw Maria issue from the porch In transport led by Gilbert. Anna next Came smiling forth, to Fred'rick wedded. Then Cheerful tho' single, and the only maid Without a mate, Sophia tripp'd along. The good man follow'd with a face of joy, And Ronsart. Show'rs of roses strew'd the path, And sprigs of myrtle, lavender, and bay. The chaises both are fill'd, the steeds remounted, And through the village street I saw them pass, While ev'ry door and ev'ry window throng'd, And ev'ry countenance was full of mirth, And merrily the bells rang round. And I Stood thrilling as they went, for in my soul I love the sight of happiness enjoy'd: Would it were lasting, and not quickly past, Short as the transports of a wedding-day. Nor stood I long, for at the wedding feast I knew this face was welcome, and I went. And I beheld young Ronsart as he rode And chatted with Sophia. I beheld His bashful look and unaffected tears, When warm with love he loiter'd far behind, Bewail'd his folly, and in humble tone Besought the fair one, if her gen'rous heart Could e'er forget the wickedness he thought, Could love a stranger of his deeds asham'd, She would regard his unabating sighs, And with her hand reward him. I beheld Sophia's cheek with ardent blushes spread. I heard her tell him of a man she lov'd, And he had long lov'd her, and yesternight The letter Fred'rick brought was penn'd by him, And he was constant still. Then Ronsart bow'd, And wav'd his claim, and to his fate resign'd. To Gilbert's house they came, and I was there, And shook thy hand, Sophia, and thy lips Kiss'd with a lover's warmth. I saw the tear Run trickling from thy eye. I felt thy hand In ecstasy press mine. I saw thy tongue, Eager to tell me of an age of news, Could utter nothing, and was bound like mine In chains of joy and undissembled love. I sat beside thee at the feast; I serv'd; I cheer'd thee, and was cheer'd; I fill'd thy glass; I pledg'd thy toast; I reach'd thee fruit; I drank, And with thee sang; I led thee to the walk; I led thee home; I led thee to the dance. Time had no durance; with a prater's tongue He counted his short hours, and speedy night Gallop'd her coursers to conclude the day. Surely the time shall come, when once again Thou shalt adorn the feast, and lead the dance, Thyself the wedded fair. Cords of restraint Shall cease to bind me, and the lonely cot Yield all its pleasures to thy lip and mine.</field>

Departed soul, whose sudden calm decease Came in the moment when thy joyous heart Welcom'd the birth-hour of thy latest bornâ Thou at whose feet a care-devoted child I stood unconscious in the hour of death, And saw thy eyelid close, nor deem'd it aught Save the sweet symptom of returning sleepâ Kind parent, whose indulgence yet my soul Fondly remembers, and thy name reveresâ If in the mansions where thy spirit dwells Inhabits sweet remembrance of thy own, Know they are happy, and thy virtues hail With never-ceasing pride and filial joy. III. VERSES TO AMANDA. If Prometheus, my charmer, complain'd Of the rigorous justice of Jove, And to Caucasus ever was chain'd, When he stole only fire from above; Shalt thou 'scape the Thunderer's blow, And thy infinite theft be forgiven, Who hast plunder'd all nature below, Who hast stol'n all the beauties of heaven? O no, thou no longer shalt stray From the fetters of punishment free; Mighty Jove the vast wrong shall repay, And chain thee for everâto me. IV. CANZONET I. When the grey witch of former days Presum'd to exercise her spell, She made her exit in a blaze, And he that is bewitch'd was well. But now, since more angelic shapes At incantation take their turn, The beauteous sorceress escapes, And he that is bewitch'd must burn. So am I doom'd in spite of aid To languish in the midst of flame, Fast-stak'd by yon enchanting maid, Who charms me with her very name. Bewitching beauty, ah, restrain The pow'rful magic of thine eye, Bestow a smile upon my pain, And set me free, or let me die. Rouse thy displeasure. Let despair With his keen arrow pierce my side, Or give me ease, which must be there, Where heav'n, and love, and thou reside. V. THE MIDNIGHT INVOCATION. Ye fairies who float on the breeze, And in blossoms delight to repose, Or regale with convenience and ease In the moss-cover'd bud of the rose. Ye elves who in acorn-cups dwell, Sleeping fast through the fervours of noon, And rejoice round the hyacinth's bell To dance down the pale day of the moon. Lay aside ev'ry sport ye pursue On the mountain or dew-besprent green, And your gay summer habits renew, To come hither and wait on your Queen. Make ye haste at the dead of the night From her chamber to steal her away, Oh make haste, and again to my sight My divine little charmer convey. Your most easy of chariots prepare, One whose wheels are on thistledown borne, And conduct her asleep thro' the air Softly smiling as rosy-cheek'd morn. Deck her couch with the blossoms of spring, Round about her sweet essences shed, And suspend the grey butterfly's wing For a canopy over her head. In the lap of sweet slumber and ease On the plumes of the moth let her lie, And her cheek curtain close from the breeze With the web of the foe to the fly. And, since slumber and music agree, Gentle harmonies round her be heard, The soft flutes of the gnat and the bee, And the hum of the dew-sipping bird. At my door when your myriads alight, Let no footstep disquiet her peace; Come ye down like the snow in the night, Soft and still as the dew on the fleece. And if, wak'd, from yon intricate thorn The sweet linnet should warble his lay, Bid him hush, for it is not the morn, He has long to repose before day. Airy charmer, who thus to my sight, Cloth'd in fancy's bewitching attire, Comest ever by day and by night, While I gaze and too fondly admire; Lift thine eye and my passion approve, For I own, and conceal it no more, Thou alone art the fairy I love, Thou alone art the sylph I adore. Yet, alas! since to these longing arms Thy attractions thou wilt not resign, Slumber on while I dote on thy charms, And applaud what must never be mine. Ah! the Fates, gentle Waller, design'd That our lots should in one thing agree; Thou wast won by a maiden unkind, And a maiden unkind has won me. Thou didst love, and still she could refuse, Sweet encouragement never was thine, Saccharissa could laugh at thy muse, Annabella is heedless of mine. VI. TO A LADY, WHO, UPON RECEIVING A FLOWER, OBSERVED THAT NATURE COULD NOT HAVE MADE IT MORE PERFECT. Could Nature do no more for this fair flower? Assert it not, fair maidâit is not true; To make a fairer she had surely power, Who made a fairer when she modell'd you For the thought of this little piece, and one of the lines, the Author confesses himself to have been indebted to an ingenious friend. VII. CANZONET II. In my bosom contentment shall reign, And despair shall torment me no more, I have seen my lov'd fair one again, And she came with a smile to my door. I have seen her, tho' transient her stay, Tho' time would not loiter and wait, And the show'r has not yet wash'd away The small print of her foot at my gate. Rapid day, the strong reason explain Why thy steeds were so quick to be gone, To remove my sweet angel again, And to leave me to linger alone. Come again, and, to merit my praise, Travel slow thro' the regions above, And I'll give thee the gratefulest lays, Which can flow from the bosom of love. O return, and, to win my good will, When I see her approach from afar, Turn thy steeds with their heads to a hill, And lock fast ev'ry wheel of thy car. VIII. LINES INSERTED IN A POCKET-BOOK. Go, little book, I charge thee post away; To the fair hand of her I love depart, And in soft numbers to her eye convey The still confession of a wounded heart. Whisper the hopeless passion in her ear, Which thy sad master can no longer hide, And say not Littleton was more sincere When at his Lucy's grave he fondly sigh'd. Go, and return not, but from day to day Plead for affection till her heart approve; Go, and return not, but for ever stay, The sacred pledge of unforbidden love. For know, if to this hand these leaves return, And to this heart unwelcome tidings bear, Thou must a flame-devoted victim burn Upon the kindled altar of despair. But if thou stay, and her propitious eye Delight to read my undissembling line, Thy precious memory shall never die, But live eternal as her love and mine. IX. ADDRESS TO THE MOON. Replenish'd moon, whose unobstructed beam Once more upon the windows of my cot Shines with such sweet indulgence, welcome still. I bid thee welcome with a cheerful heart, Which loves thy gentle mitigated ray, And the sweet smile of mute benevolence Which glows upon thy browâwhether thy orb Rise in the tranquil hour, and climb in peace The azure concave of unclouded heav'n, Or leave its couch to cross a stormy sky, And post triumphantly from cloud to cloudâ Or whether thy pure beam shed second day Upon a frosty scene of hills and dales Cover'd with winter's snow, or dimly rise From autumn's purple east with aspect streak'd, Tawny, and slowly bright'ning, as subsides The ray of mellow ev'ning in the westâ Yes, I still love thee, and thy rising hail With all the little music which the lyre Struck by my hand can utter. Yet, fair moon, Much as I love thee, let me wish thee gone. Empty thy golden globe. Reverse thy horns, Swiftly renewing till thy ample orb Once more arrive at her full-lumin'd hour. For know, unwearied empress of the night, Soon as thy lamp industrious shall have run Its phasy circuit round the tardy earth, So soon I meet the fair one I adore, My promise-bound companion in the dance. Then, cheerful orb, I shall not look on thee. Fair as thou art, a fairer still than thou Will all my tendance win. Sweet is thy smile, But sweeter her's. For as thy beauteous light O'ercomes the feebler glories of the sky, So will her fair appearance thy poor ray With ease subdue, and make it pale and faint As at the dawn of all-eclipsing day. X. CANZONET III. When the maid that possesses my heart Was content at my mansion to stay, Rapid time was in haste to depart, And the moments fled laughing away. But now since I see her not near, And to seek her is not in my pow'r, Ev'ry day is as long as a year, Ev'ry moment as slow as an hour. Tardy time, thy fleet pinions repair, To be swifter than ever was known; Let the hours while I wait for my fair Dance away upon sandals of down. But when, her gay fellows among, At my door my sweet angel appears, Bid the moments steal softly along, And lengthen the days into years. XI. ADDRESS TO HAPPINESS. O happiness, thou puny short-liv'd plant, Whose tender branch this world's inclement sky But ill endures, and bears abundant bloom In the pacific clime of Heaven alone, Let me thy transient beauty strive to rear, Not without hope, uncertain as thou art, That thy sweet blossom shall at length be mine. I'll give thee shelter from all winds that blow, Diffuse eternal summer round thy head, And satisfy thy root with gentle drops, Warm as the dew the tender mother sheds Upon her drooping child. And in return Do thou, sweet stranger, to my longing eye At least one blossom leisurely unfold, To be transported, when occasion smiles, Into the bosom of the maid I love. There to abide, perchance, shall please thee well, For 'tis a mansion like thy native seat, The fair abode of innocence and truth. Be it thy home, and satisfy mankind That happiness can flourish here below, And is not always like the cereus' bloom, Alive at night, and wither'd ere the morn. XII. CANZONET IV. Can aught be more fair to the eye Than the blush of the maidenly year? Can aught with the orchard-bloom vie, When in May its sweet blossoms appear? Can aught like the eglantine please, Or the rose budding? Tell me, what can? O thrice more attracting than these Is the cheek of my sweet little Anne. What can charm like the spring of the field, When it trickles transparently by? Or what sweeter pleasure can yield, Than to look on the gems of the sky? What can win like the tremulous dew Which the Zephyrs on gossamer fan? O thrice more enchanting to view Is the eye of my sweet little Anne. Can aught like the morning delight, When it dawns toward peaceable day? Or bewitch like the planet of night, When she steals in good humour away? Is there aught like the sweetness of eve, When, serene as when nature began, The soft sun takes his mellow last leave? Yes, the smile of my sweet little Anne. Can aught more delicious be nam'd Than the exquisite fruit of the pine? More inviting can aught be proclaim'd Than the elegant bunch of the vine? Is there aught can in flavour exceed Ev'ry beverage precious to man? O yes, these are tasteless indeed To the kiss of my sweet little Anne. Thrice more than the sun-setting hour, Or the dawn of the morning, benign, More delightful than spring's sweetest flow'r, Or the mirth-making juice of the vine, More serene than the gems of the sky, And more soft than the down of the swan, Is the cheek, is the lip, is the eye, Is the smile, of my sweet little Anne. XIII. SECOND ADDRESS TO THE MOON. Moon that so fairly risest from the crown Of yon high oak, and wast so fondly pray'd To fill thy orb with light, ah me! how cold, How little welcome is thy cheerless beam! Methought it would have found me full of hope, And at the side of one whose winning smiles My soul devoutly honours. But it comes To see me languishing in discontent, To see me pining with a brimful eye, Soliciting in vain the buried dart Which festers in my bosom. Gentle moon, How did I blame thee that thy phasy lamp So tardily increas'd! For now methought I should again my charmer's eye engage, And touch the hand which her own welcome word, Her own spontaneous promise had decreed Should at this moment have been link'd in mine. O happiness, thou fair delusive flower, How painfully had I thy puny bud Taught to unfold its slow reluctant leaf! How had I cherish'd thee, with little doubt Ere this thy grateful blossom would have grac'd The glowing bosom of rewarded love! But ah! a cruel worm has kill'd my hopes, Nor can I decorate a wounded heart With that sweet blossom which it surely needs. An exile let me wander, far from hope, Far from the haven of content and ease, Far from that Paradise my doting heart Fondly suppos'd its own. Such was the pain Desponding Adam felt when from his hand The gracious Angel parted, and he saw Before him barren earth's unbounded plain, Behind him God's high-blazing fiery sword. Such anguish felt he when the golden gate Clos'd on the blooming garden, which his hand Had with affection nurtur'd. And such too Were the few natural drops he shed apart, And wip'd them soon. So did he overlook And bury in her tears the bitter smart Eve's indiscretion rais'd, concealing half And all forgiving the vast woe he felt. Poor discontented heart! when shalt thou taste Of the pure spring of happiness again! Wide is the moon from the life-shedding sun, Wide are the spangled heavens from the earth, Wide is the east from the day-drowning west; Yet are not all these distances so wide As the wide distance between thee and peace. Thou restless tenant of an aching breast, Why dost thou labour at the forge of life With such impetuous stroke? 'Tis not disease Which comes thy little kingdom to disturb: 'Tis not the fever which alarms my blood, Or brain delirious, which in ugly dream Sees bony death with his potential bar Heaving the lid of the unwholesome vault, To give my relics room. No, 'tis the loss Of only one sweet jewel dearly priz'd, Whose absence may be some day not perceiv'd, Tho' never recompens'd. Then be at ease; The darkest night is follow'd by a dawn; The gloomiest cavern has a distant mouth, Which opens to the sun. Anguish and pain Are changeable and waning as the moon. The weeping mother of an only child Can place him in the bowels of the earth, And feel content again. His blooming bride The husband buries, and forgets his loss. Then may thy quick tumultuous throb be still'd By the slow lapse of moments, months, and years. Be patient then, and let my wakeful eye Meet its accustom'd slumbers. One pang more Shall be allow'd thee, when the die is cast, And she's for ever and for ever gone. Then to thy peace return, nor waste a sigh, Convinc'd that Heaven in the cup of life Mingles prevention for the good of man. XIV. TO A LADY, WHO DREW THE PINS FROM HER BONNET IN A THUNDER-STORM. Cease, Eliza, thy locks to despoil, Nor remove the bright steel from thy hair; For fruitless and fond is the toil, Since nature has made thee so fair. While the rose on thy cheek shall remain, And thine eye so bewitchingly shine, Thy endeavour must still be in vain, For attraction will always be thine. XV. ADDRESS TO CRITICISM. Sister of Nature, lovely Criticism, Whose friendly, exquisite, judicious touch Softens the blaze of genius, and the work Of every muse improves; ingenious maid, Deem not I shun thee with a scornful eye. Come to my side, and look upon my work: Be seated by me. Ruminate my page; And while my hand is loop'd about thy waist, And my reclining head in thoughtful ease Reposes on thy shoulder, mark my faults. Point to the line which my impatient pen Has hastily dismiss'd, and blot the word Which gives offence to decency or truth. I feel and own that I have much to mend. Reprove me, and advise me. Thy rebuke Is ever tender, and so mix'd with love, 'Tis but a precious medicine disguis'd, Which charms the palate, and restores the man. Such is thy censure, Cowper, whom my muse Dares to believe, nor scruples to pronounce The fairest critic, and the sweetest bard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. III. TEARS OF AFFECTION, A POEM, Occasioned by THE DEATH OF A SISTER TENDERLY BELOVED. Nos societ tumulus, societ nos obsecro cÅlum. Sir T. More. Eja age in amplexus, cara Maria, redi. Lowth. 'Tis done, 'tis done, the bitter hour is past, And Isabel my treasure, my delight, Is number'd with the dead. I see the hearse With sable plumes and sullen-footed steeds The village church approach. I see the corse, From its dark cell releas'd, by many a hand Uplifted heavily. I hear the bell Toll to the slow and melancholy step Of mute procession, the white priest before, The mourners following, and in the midst, Thee my delight, my pleasure, and my hope, Under the flowing pall. I see my love Borne thro' the portal of her native church, Thence never to return. I hear a voice Consign her to oblivion, dust to dust, Ashes to ashes. Everlasting God, Author of life, and sovereign of death, Why hast thou stript me of this lovely gem, The glory of my bosom? Was my tongue Unwilling to intreat thee? Was my knee Tardy to kneel? or did my anxious heart Ask without fervour for the life it sought? Mysterious Being, with unceasing prayer Have I thy throne approach'd, beseeching health For this my dearest blessing. With large tears Have I thy grace intreated day and night, Requesting rather pain and poverty Than this so bitter loss. Yet still in vain Have I besought thee, and thy will be done. I know there is not righteousness in man, And of the blessings which I yet enjoy I nothing merit. Loud as I complain'd, Devoutly as I pray'd, thine ear was shut Without injustice; and the pains I feel Are the due wages of my mean desert. Eternal God, must I no more enjoy The genial comforts which thy liberal hand Once shed about me? Must yon lonely cot Know me no more? yon wood-besprinkled vale Echo no longer to my careless song? No! my sweet treasure Isabel is gone, And in yon rural mansion lives no more The village Curate. To some stranger's eye Must it unfold its blossoms, the sweet buds Which art has taught its windows to surround. To mine they give no pleasure, nor to me Smiles, as it did, the valley or the brook, The wood, the coppice, the paternal oak, Or village steeple station'd on the hill. No! my sweet treasure Isabel is gone. Some messenger of God my door has pass'd From earth returning, saw the beauteous flower, Transported gather'd it, and in his hand Bore it to heav'n rejoicing. Lo! my tears! They flow for Isabel, whom these my eyes, When first they wak'd to reason and to sense, Found a poor friendless infant at my side In the same cradle sleeping. With a smile And arms outstretch'd it pleaded for my love, And won affection which no time could kill, No accident abate. Our souls were one, One were our hopes, our pleasures, and our pains. Wept Isabel? into her wounded heart Sweet consolation her companion pour'd. Droop'd with distemper her unhealthy mate? She at his side sat weeping, sooth'd his pain With gentle eye-drops and the tender tone Of sympathy maternal, nor forbore Till rosy welfare to his cheek return'd. Then sported they together, from the world Long time remote, where yon enormous downs Shoulder the eastern moon. The mountain's side They scal'd together, on his airy brow Together loiter'd, and together bowl'd The bounding flint into the vale below. Together stood they trembling on the cliff, To view the wide unlimited expanse Of ocean green beneath, what time the storm His azure realm had troubled, and at large The tempest-loving porpoise thro' his waves Flounder'd unheeding. On the pebbly beach With painful step they travell'd side by side, Shrunk at the thund'ring downfall of the surge, And chas'd the flying foam. Never apart Till Education at her season came, Sever'd their hands, and bade the boy averse To learning's distant fane her steps attend. Yet still tow'rd Isabel's belov'd retreat A longing eye he cast, her parting tears Remember'd, her engaging smile, her look Of meek affection, her impassion'd kiss. Oft on the spotless sheet with breathing pen He pour'd the tender sentiment he felt. She the warm line perus'd, and dwelt with pride On ev'ry glowing period. So increas'd Love not to be subdued, and like the moon To ampler plenitude and sweeter day Proceeded hourly; but not like the moon Increas'd to wane, augmented but to change. No, my sweet Isabel, thy faithful love Knew no decline; from day to day it grew, From year to year, an amaranthine flower Unchangeable. With exquisite delight She welcom'd home the countenance she lov'd, What time Vacation 'gan his airy dance, And left Tuition nodding o'er his books In Academus' shades: with show'r of joy Welcom'd the day when Education's claims Drew to a period, and the youth was her's, Never to leave her more. Then to the cot Not unaccompanied by those they lov'd Contented they withdrew. Then life began, And sweetly pass'd it by their happy door, While they and health and innocence within Sat at the board together. There they dwelt, And often rose in the sweet morn of May, To watch the slow and timorous return Of renovated Spring. With eye well-pleas'd They saw the sun industrious from his couch Still on the morrow with an earlier smile His beauteous dawn dispense; with joyful heart Noted the progress of the gradual vale Slowly reviving, saw the op'ning bud Spread its incautious blossom to the breeze, The tender leaf for its protection spring, And gloried to behold the lonely oak In tardy foliage cloth'd. Yes, day by day 'Twas thy supreme and innocent delight With me, my Isabel, the plant and flower, The shrub and the espalier, the high wood, The hedge-row, field, and orchard to observe, Each in its turn with vegetative life Freely endued, and, as its season came, Clad in peculiar honours. With thy eye Has mine enchanted round the garden stray'd, And oft have I beheld thee with a smile Thy families protecting, raising some, Some wedding to the marriageable stem, And some with dew-drops cheering. Ah! no more Must thy sweet converse in the garden shade My list'ning ear engage. Thou shalt no more Hear me discourse of wisdom freely shed On ev'ry work below, and to the sight Of him who searches easy to be seen. Our eyes no more upon the bloom of spring Shall dwell together. Never shall I hear Thy tongue again the concert of the grove Applaud, and mark at thy request the strain Of many a warbler singing to his mate. The bird of morn The Lark., that on the sun-beam floats, What time he darts it from the deep aslant, And smites unseen the flecker'd roof of heav'n, Shall no more wake thee with his early song In wild division warbled. Nor again Her solo anthem shall the bird of night The Nightingale., Heard with attention, to thy watchful ear In the still coppice vary. Eve and morn Participated pleasure shall no more To us distribute. With thy arm in mine I shall no more the sober walk enjoy In the still ev'ning vale, what time the rook With whisp'ring wing brushes the midway air, To the high wood impatient to return. We shall no more yon family of oaks, Which crowds the bottom of the gloomy vale, Visit together, when the shades of night Double the horrors of their mingled boughs. We shall not listen to the free complaint Of the day-dreading partridge, oft dispers'd, And often pitied by thy tongue and mine. We shall not hear with sympathetic heart The distant bell, whose deep and equal tone Tolls to the grave some relative deceas'd, Some child, some parent, or some spouse belov'd, And dear to them who follow, as ourselves Were precious to each other. No! dear girl, Thy own sad knell has toll'd. My wounded heart Has yearn'd at thy decease, and tho' my foot Refus'd to follow to the yawning grave Thy cold remains, my overflowing eye Has wept thee plenteously. It weeps thee still, And daily, while I may, the silent spot Where thy poor reliques rest, with swelling heart Will I revisit. Daily by thy grave Will I the luxury of grief profuse Indulge, and dwell a statue on the spot Where the dark vault its stony jaws has clos'd On Isabel my treasure, and ere long Shall close on me. The solitary walls Which guard thy corse shall my domestic Muse With unaffected eulogy inscribe, And place her breathing tablet o'er thy bones With the deep sigh of exquisite regret. My tongue shall oft report thee, and my feet Rejoice to be detain'd, while at thy side I tell the moving tale of thy desert. Here sleeps my Isabel, the brightest gem Heav'n in my crown had plac'd, my bosom-star, The sweet companion of my lonely hours, Whose presence made a moment of a day, Whose absence makes a century of an hour. With me she tripp'd upon the airy down, With me she loiter'd in the sunny vale, With me applauded nature, ever fair, Revolve in what vicissitude she will. In ev'ry season of the beauteous year Her eye was open, and with studious love Read the divine Creator in his works. Chiefly in thee, sweet Spring, when ev'ry nook Some latent beauty to her wakeful search Presented, some sweet flow'r, some virtual plant. In ev'ry native of the hill and vale She found attraction, and where beauty fail'd, Applauded odour or commended use. So was the wild geranium to her breast, However simple and however plain, A welcome ornament; germander so, With his blue flow'r on ev'ry bank dispers'd, No guest impertinent. The humble vetch Her posy grac'd, and the pale rose of prime. The orchis elegant, with many a tier Of fly-resembling blossoms each o'er each Pagoda-like dispos'd. With tender sense The pimpernel, which to the humid morn, Ere yet the shower-shedding cloud appears, Its bosom closes, and presages wet. The tansey with its bloom of gold, and leaf Verdant above, with silver lin'd beneath. The lujula, which often on the bank Dwells by the woodland strawberry, and presents A leaf not less delicious than his fruit, A flow'r superior. Such and thousands more, Leisurely gather'd, have thy hand and breast, Dear Isabel, adorn'd, while I well pleas'd Have mark'd thy studious search, and unperceiv'd Drawn thee thus loit'ring in unutter'd song; Or idly wound the clasping eglantine About thy crown, or fill'd thy hair with flow'rs Of the sweet woodbine, whose maternal branch Suckles the bee with honey and the moth. Yes, gentle maid, thy steps have I pursu'd In search of summer beauties, and observ'd Myriads that wak'd me to delight and joy, But none so fair, so lovely as thyself. With thee have I admir'd the shady grove, The sunny champaign, the extensive weald Scatter'd with steeples, messuages, and mills, And dwelt on many a pleasurable spot Of intersected pasture, with its stack, Cottage and lodge, few sheep and grazing cow, Deeming content and happiness were there. With thee have I applauded the deep vale, Its verdure mellowing as it stole away, To either margin of a winding stream Presenting fainter shadows, softer woods; With thee beheld with smile affectionate Our native downs remote, hill behind hill, Gigantic family, some near, some far, Withdrawing till their faint expiring tops Were almost lost and melted into air. With thee have I delighted still to rove At morn, at eve, in twilight, and at noon, Long as sweet summer lasted. Chiefly then When tufts of primrose smil'd upon the bank, Gracing the verge of some translucent stream, Or glassy lake, whose mirror their soft flow'rs Reflected softer to the loit'rer's eye. Or when the strawberry with ruddy cheek Provok'd the finger to be plucking still, When fragrant honeysuckle his sweet flow'r Along the hedge-row scatter'd, and the breeze Of ev'ning freely his perfume dispens'd; When blossom'd clover, or the martial bean, The hayrick newly built, or bitter hop Emitting from the oast a grateful steam, Fill'd all the vale with odours. Arm in arm Have we the dews of ev'ning often met, And the pale ray of the September moon, What time ascending with discolour'd cheek She peer'd above the cloud or highland wood, And silently improving as she rose Hung o'er the faded landscape full of light; A glorious lamp, to cheer a boundless hall Floating across the living dome of heav'n, Suspended upon nothing. Arm in arm Have we the sun of morning on the brow Yet unapparent welcom'd, and his soft Emergent glory like the bee enjoy'd, Roving from bank to bank, from hill to hill. Along the meadow now, or thro' the field Of sheaves erect, or barley by the scythe In frequent lines dispos'd, or fertile oat. Now by the stream, to hear the liquid lapse Of Rother gliding o'er some pebbly shoal, Or with hoarse tumult thro' the foamy dam And idle mill-wheel falling. Homeward now Thro' many a garden which the foster'd hop Shades with his branch prolific, yet untouch'd: Now to some quarter where his honours fall, Thro' many a family who pluck his flow'rs, And fill the bin with gold, there to delay, And haply some assist the pole to strip, Bestowing freely a few moments toil To mark how industry her task pursues, With finger never weary, singing still. Now to the village, whose aspiring church High on a hillock in the valley stands, And smiles with glory in the rising sun, As if it lov'd the prospect it adorns. How sweet the pleasure then, in some lone nook Under a precipice, or lofty wood, To pause and listen, while the village bells, By distance mellow'd, their melodious tones Each after other to the feeding ear Softly persuasive utter'd; faintly heard Sometimes, and scarce more audible, remote, Than the mellifluous octave, gently touch'd By some impassion'd songstress, to relieve Her soul-subduing song; sometimes more bold, A sweet harmonious diapason swell Of gradual increase, by the breeze at length In loud confusion huddled on the ear, Till echo chid them, and they died again. Ah me! such pleasures shall be mine no more. My lov'd companion, whose endearing smile And sensible remark made all things sweet, Attends my paths no more. My gentle friend Is snatch'd away to Heav'n. Content is gone, And sorrow saddens every step I tread. Dear spirit, come again. In some lone hour, While thus I sit in melancholy thought, With eyes intent upon the quiv'ring flame That plays along the hearth, and shed my tears Without reluctance, open wide the door, Steal to my side unseen, and with a kiss, As often wont, my reverie disperse. Recall me with a smile from the dark gloom Of woe and discontent, and once again Bring to my side sweet peace; for she is fled, And has been long departed. When disease First prey'd on thee, my treasure, she withdrew, And wander'd God knows whither. Cruel maid! She left me tho' I lov'd her, and is gone With those to linger who shall prize her less. Then come again, dear spirit, come again, And let thy smile exhilarate a soul Which cannot live and be content alone. I will esteem thee more and chide thee less, And nothing utter which thy heart shall wound, Tho' death divide us never. Want of ease, And frequent sense of agony conceal'd, Has sometimes made me in the wayward hour E'en thee, thou blameless innocent, reprove; And thou hast wept to ease an aching heart, Which almost burst at my undue rebuke. Return again, sweet spirit. Let me weep, And make atonement for the wrong I own. Thou wilt not blame me. Guilty as I am, Forgiveness shall be mine. Wert thou my judge, My debt of trespass would be small indeed. Come, let me hold thee with a father's love, And yield thee benefits thrice more in weight Than father ever on his child bestow'd. Thou art my daughter. When my weeping Muse The filial Marg'ret drew, she copied thee. Nor can I deem thee to the brilliant gem Of More inferior, tho' with justice styl'd BritanniÃ¦ decus.â Erasm.The grace of Britain. Piety was thine, As piety was her's. Good humour, love, Compassion, pleasantry and soft address, Exterior symbols of a mind within Gentle, humane, and friendly, grac'd you both. Both from attentive childhood's earliest hour Were by the Muses nurtur'd. Marg'ret's eye Delighted ever on the page to dwell Of sweet instruction, and no leisure hour Neglected Isabel, and not improv'd; Pursuing still the multifarious tale Of general story, of the world at large Discoursing, ancient continent and new, Of kingdoms born, and mighty states deceas'd, Of wars and victories and routed hosts, And millions slain, of whom and of their deeds But in the classic page no trace exists. Now to the changes of her native isle Strictly attentive, from its earliest birth The growth of pow'r she trac'd, and gradual rise Of commerce, feeble in its first essay, Spreading another and another sail, Till ocean swarm'd with ventures, till excess Came to the shores, till luxury began, And exquisite refinement wondrous nice Allow'd no blemish in the work she sought. The birth of learning then, and childish march Of science, yet an infant led by strings, She mark'd, and thro' successive ages watch'd The puny stripling till he grew to man. With sages thus which every age adorn'd, Philosophers and scholars, she ere long Had intimate acquaintance, and the tale Of anecdote peculiar still pursued, And gloried to remember. Ye whose pens In moral lesson have your country taught, Say which of you she knew not? studious ever Of your instructive and amusing line, Whether it march'd in solemn state along, Or wanton'd idly to arrest the eye, And lead the slumb'ring judgment unawares To sense of duty. Which of you, ye bards, Had she not follow'd thro' your airy flights? Whether aloft in Epic song sublime And bold Pindaric soaring, or beneath Flutt'ring in humble verse, or steadier song Warbling suspended in the midway heav'n. From the wild terrace of the British muse She ev'ry flow'r had gather'd, and dispos'd In cabinet secure her posied sweets, The weed rejecting ever. Witness these So neatly penn'd, so carefully preserv'd, Volumes of beauty, for the leisure eye And faithless memory copied. Prospers here The puniest blossom of the classic muse, Here flourishes the fairest. Chiefly thine, Thou bard of nature, Shakespeare. Milton, thine; Thine, Dryden, from a mound of rubbish cull'd, Yet not inferior to the best that blow. Thine, Spenser, to the antiquarian eye Soberly pleasing. Butler, thine, replete With learning, sense, and wit. Roscommon, thine, Judicious, elegant; and, Otway, thine, Applauded and reprov'd. Thine, Pope, as gems Not seldom lustrous, sometimes tinsel-ray'd. Thine, gentle Pomfret, not to be despis'd; And, nebulous Blackmore, thine. Thine, charming Rowe, Politest grace of the dramatic page; And thine, poetic Prior. Parnel, thine, To me of lovely fragrance. Thomson, thine; And thine, more musical, descriptive less, Young, in whose tedious and protracted song Still gleams and still expires the cloudy day Of genuine poetry. Thine too are there, Impetuous Akenside, as thunder strong. Thine, awful, pleasing, persecuted Gray. Thine, lovelorn Littleton; and, Shenstone, thine, An artificial nosegay made of shells. And thine, not least esteem'd, tho' latest nam'd, Ingenious Cowper. From thy various Muse, Sweet bard, she frequent entertainment sought, Nor long could seek in vain. Upon thy page Her eye was feeding, when invidious death Her bosom wounded with his poison'd shaft. And soon she thought thy labour to repay With some fair pledge of honour and esteem, By her own art accomplish'd. Time to come, Far as the ken of certainty may reach, She to display had purpos'd, and thine ear With sweet prophetic narrative to feed As long as hunger would. For she had skill The moon from her high orbit to decoy, And hold her spell-bound in the midst of heav'n, While she propounded question, at what hour The phasy wand'rer with decreasing orb Her course anomalous fulfill'd unseen; Or at what hour with half replenish'd horn She grac'd the brow of eve, or when replete Rose in full glory in the belt of night. Then question sprung, if in her annual course Ofttimes the world embracing, thro' the band Which marks the fancied circuit of the sun At her renewal, or her full-fac'd hour, She pass'd. Affirmative reply with style Correct was noted, and from thence arose Examen nice, how near or how remote The node she sail'd to, or the node she left; And whether as she journey'd, void or fill'd, She touch'd the distant shadow of the earth, Or shadow'd earth herself. Earth's shadow then Was feebly pictur'd, and the point exact By computation noted, where the orb Of night first smote it, and her borrow'd beam Slowly submitted, till her faded cheek Was all with wan deliquium sicklied o'er. Her central course athwart the shade she cross'd, And ev'ry moment of her pallid march Were represented then, till her thick veil Earth drew aside, impatient of delay, And the sweet loss she mourn'd. Then glow'd anew The silver crescent with improving horn, And the fair orb thro' all her changes pass'd Of wane and increase in a summer's eve. The moon thus portray'd in her languid hour, Question arose what time her rayless orb The sunbeam intercepted, and how large The portion sever'd from his ardent globe By her intruding disc; at what bright hour She 'gan invade him, and her central path, Whether it smote his axis in the midst, Total eclipse inducing, or a ring Of glory sparing on his utmost skirt. Such arduous queries would the fair one ask, And reason answer'd, on her spotless blank The luminaries painting, each in turn Involv'd in partial or in total gloom; The one long struggling with her adverse hour, The other soon victorious. Nor alone Computed she the labours of the moon Or parent sun, as their expiring balls The passant year alarm'd, or years to come Clouded with idle terrors yet unborn. Into the dark abysm of ages past An eye inquisitive she threw, and oft The credulous historian, copying still The date erroneous, with unerring art Chastis'd and rectified, the glorious fact To its lost hour restoring, till the page Of maim'd chronology spake truth alone. Such was thy skill, dear maid, by nature taught The maze of heav'nly motions to explore. Nor this thy only art; in numbers vers'd, And able early to untie with ease The problematic knot, howe'er delay'd By fraction cumbersome, and hard to rule. Thine was the pow'r, when calculation swarm'd With digits numberless, and scarce could urge Her toilsome process, by unwieldy size Retarded, to conduct with ease the mind Thro' all its movements to the truth it sought By that sweet art of the wild Arab learn'd. Compendious method, whose disputing march Relieves the soul of effort, and cuts short The labour of attention, making truth To him who millions agitates involv'd No longer vex'd and tedious, nor to him Who geometric inference pursues, Still on the letter'd diagram intent. Thine also was the art, to touch with skill And various feeling the persuasive stop Of organ mellow-ton'd, slow movement first And solemn fingering, till the lapt soul With sweet indulgence satiated 'gan doze As if by opium lull'd, and ill perceiv'd The melting lapse of diapason sounds, Harmonious combination falling slow Into a tremulous expiring close. Then the brisk fugue with captivating air, Expressive pause, and tone distinct and loud, Led like some active hero to the field, Led and was follow'd by battalions firm, Till universal uproar fill'd the ear. Then follow'd tender air, that stole along Like softest poetry, whose dying fall Might ravish heav'n itself. Then solemn march, Impulse scarce needing of the pow'rful trump And loud reverberating drum, to wake Reposing valour to gigantic deeds. Then air accompanied by verse and voice, Haply of Handel's muse, for some sweet grace Selected and esteem'd, haply deriv'd From genius less improv'd, from living art, Which seldom to the judgment dares appeal, Her song compiling for the ear alone. Religious anthem then thy spreading hand With its full concord swell'd, whether it breath'd Melodious solo or harmonious verse, Or shouted chorus awfully devout, Enrich'd with all the mysteries of tone. What grace had music which to thee was new Or hard to copy, evermore intent Upon her learned pleasure-giving page? And yet not so intent, but that thy eye Would often hunger for sedater fare, Would thirst th' amusing characters of Greece In Homer's line to read, and drink the stream Of pure Castalius genuine as it fell. Nor of that fount alone, but of the fount Of God, whence prophets their sublimer draught Drew, till the plenteous bev'rage on their lips Kindled divine enthusiasm, long'd thy soul To taste with freedom. Hence thy brave attempt To climb the mountain of JudÃ¦an writ, Till nought of Hebrew rudiment thy search Or memory escap'd. The key was thine The ark of ancient promise to unlock, And there the sacred leaf, to others dumb, To scan and to interpret for thyself. Yet slighted not thy truth-adoring soul The volume of translation, long esteem'd And executed well, nor needing yet, Save here and there, a sense-restoring touch. Thence drew thy judgment a continual feast, The chain of prophecy expounding still, Link after link, as story lent thee light, And tracing with conviction the strong proof Of Christian verity, still free to doubt And nothing credulous, yet yielding still To equal testimony brave assent. Such were the treasures of thy active mind, Ingenious Isabel; such the sweet arts Which made thee to a brother dear indeed; That not the pious child of More to him Seem'd to possess, enchanting as she was, Of mental beauty a more ample share. Yet, lovely as thou wert, thy hour is past, Thy beaming day is ended. Thou art gone, Fleeting and transient as the cloud of morn, And only this poor feeble outline lives, This stol'n resemblance of thy trembling shade, Cast by the midnight taper on the wall, And sorrowfully pencil'd ere thy lips Were cold in death. Yes, this poor shade alone Is all that Heav'n has left me, and e'en this Had not been mine to weep o'er and to love, But that my daring pencil, spite of grief, The feature copied when the soul was fled. Dear welcome image, in my bosom dwell. Forsake me never. Let me love thee still, And often gaze upon thy lifeless cheek Till blinded sorrow has no eye to see. Let me the kiss of ecstasy imprint On thy cold lips, oft as my sinking soul With recollection bows of those dear hours When thy belov'd original was mine, To speak to and caress. Then go in peace, And to the mansion of my heart return, Whence none but death shall pluck thee. There repose In mute security till life be spent. Nought that reminds me of the maid I lov'd, Nor aught that she applauded or esteem'd, Shall from my sight depart. Therefore shall you, Ye gentle doves, familiar to the hand, Whom goodness long experienc'd has made tame And nothing fearful of the touch of man, Under my roof still live, and still enjoy Provision plenteous. Isabel your lives Redeem'd for pity, and the debt forgave: Dying herself, your liberty she ask'd Of thirsty violence; and ye shall fall, When nature pleases, without shedding blood. And thou too, tabby fav'rite, tho' thy eye Stranger to tears no sorrow has express'd, Still sporting on the hearth, tho' Isabel, Thy fond protectress, is thy friend no more, Thou, gentle kitten, shalt no morning-meal With slender tone petitionary ask, But I will yield it. Sit upon my knee, And whisper pleasure, gratitude, and love, For favour well bestow'd: thy silky neck Still offer to the pressure of my hand, And fear no evil: frisk upon the floor, And cuff the cushion or suspended cork Till riot make thee weary: slumber then In the warm sunbeam on the window's ledge, Till from thy fur the spark electric spring; Or doze upon the elbow of my chair, Or on my shoulder, or my knee, while I, Lost in some dream of happiness deceas'd, Steal from reflection pleasure, and beguile A morning's march across the vale of life By musing upon comforts now no more. Or if sweet sleep not please thee, with the cord And dangling tassel of the curtain play, Or seize the grumbling hornet, or pert wasp, Intruding ever, while I smile remote At danger brav'd by vent'rous ignorance And anger ill-escap'd. Only forbear To tease the fly and inoffensive moth, As Isabel forbade thee. Least of all Fasten thy talons on the fenceless dove, For that were murder not to be excus'd. O changeable and fleeting world! The hour E'en now, by time's repeating tongue announc'd, Completes the circle of twelve speedy months Since I my Isabel, with heart elate And proud of its possession, at the ball Beheld triumphant; since her rapid hand The harp's sweet strings with emulation smote, And easily victorious won the palm, Yet blush'd to take it as not well deserv'd. Where is she now? O soul-distracting thought! Open thy caverns, earth, and bless my sight With one short interview of her I mourn. And thou, great God, forgive me, if I burst The portal of the grave, ill-reconcil'd To this thy hard decree. Ye silent dead, I come to weep in your profound abodes, To shed my tears within your mould'ring vaults, 'Mid eyeless sculls and dissipated bones. I have a father somewhere. Here he lies. Good man, I much respect thee, tho' my tears Grac'd not thy fun'ral hour; a child too young To know the value of the friend he lost. Repose in peace. Thy children shall be mine. I come not now to weep thee, but to seek My long-lov'd Isabel, of all thy train Save one the youngest, and of all thy train Excepting none the loveliest. Here she sleeps, Known to a father scarce twelve little moons, To me a daughter for twelve precious years Twice told. Thou tenant of the gloomy vault, Whom these dark boards have prison'd from my sight, Thou sleeping angel, in a treble chest Thrice lock'd and bolted, let me the harsh screw, Which thy sweet smile confines from its firm hold, Wrench hatefully away: let me the seam, Which o'er thy silent innermost recess Strong cement closes, resolutely burst, To view thy welcome countenance again. Where are the lips, which mine so oft have press'd In joyous welcome and in sad adieu? Where are the eyes, which ne'er encounter'd these But to relate, in eloquence how sweet, In poetry how charming, the soft tale Of daughterly affection? Where, oh where Is the sweet voice that charm'd my soul to rest, And made my cottage but a step from heav'n? Where is the hand, so welcome to my touch, So skill'd to gratify my thirsting ear With harmony's full measure of delight? Obstruction hence! impediment away! Tho' universal hell my arm oppose I will again behold her. Lend me, Death, Lend me, grim monster, thy eternal bar, Thy massy lever, that upheaves the lid Of the mephitic marble-jaw'd abyss, And I shall all prevail. Lo! it is done. Ah me! is this my Isabel? Are these The lips where health his odoriferous gales And vernal roses shed? Are these the balls Whose dew so often fell to sooth my pain Or welcome my return, provoking still The latent sympathy my looks denied, Till my heart melted and my eye o'erflow'd? Are these the fingers that so charm'd my ear? Is this the hand that dwelt upon my arm So many summers in the ev'ning walk? The hand that serv'd me with good-will so free, Guided the pen so fairly, and the heart So sweetly portray'd on the vacant leaf? How chang'd and how disguis'd! Dear lovely maid, These wasted features, and this dread attire Deprive thee of all semblance. But for these External horrors which thy limbs enclose, And this thy name engraven, I should deem Delusion bound me in her subtle chain: Whither, oh whither is thy beauty fled? Great God of change, unchangeable thyself, How transient are thy works! The very world Is but a beauteous flow'r, whose sweet leaves Still fade to flourish, still revive to die. The tide once overwhelm'd it, and the frown Of Him who made it has its tender branch Oft wither'd. It shall perish once again E'en to the root, and yet revive and live. And so shalt thou, sweet Isabel, return. Heav'n speed the day. Eternal Deity, Be it thy pleasure to restore her soon. Restore her now. Let my unhallow'd lips The word convey. Archangel, blow the trump, And send thy death-subduing summons forth, That hell may hear and tremble: let old earth Quake to her broad foundations at thy blast, And gasp and heave with agonies intense To give her kindred millions second birth: Let heav'n be open'd, and the spotless Judge Upon the clouds descend, the shout of Gods Wafting his chariot to the world he won. I will not fly, tho' conscious of offence, And many a talent wasted and ill-us'd, Till I have seen my Isabel awake To bless me with a smile. Why stays the hour? Why slumbers justice at her chariot side? Have I no voice in heav'n? Then sorrow come, And shed no drop of comfort in my cup; Here let me die, the victim of regret, And sleep till mercy wake me, till relief Wipe all away my tears, and bid me live, For misery is no more. Close at thy side, Ingenious Isabel, let me be laid, Never to leave thee: may the daring wretch Who parts my bones from thine, feel never peace, But sigh for agonies severe as these. Sweet maid, I lov'd and rear'd thee as I could, And ask forgiveness that I did no more. Must I still live? Great God, at thy command I close my lips. I will no more complain. I will return to life, however sharp, Nor quit it till thy summons call me hence. Adieu, my love, sweet Isabel, adieu! My lost companion, exquisitely dear, I leave thy cold and solitary cell To visit life again; I shall not long Be absent from thy side; these ling'ring pains, Effect of vigilance and much concern, And fretful melancholy, pining still For thee my treasure lost, will yet prevail, And weigh me down to death: departed maid, Soon to thy side I come: and, bounteous God, Grant me this blessing, never to be mov'd From this my spot of coveted repose Till the loud trump of resurrection blow. Then (hear me Heav'n!) let these lamenting eyes, Which saw my lovely Isabel depart, First wake to endless being, and with tears Of joy profuse her renovation mark. Let me behold her, as the gentle warmth Of life rekindles, as her glowing cheek The hue of health recovers, as her pulse Begins again to throb, her lip to breathe; Then let me wake her with an ardent kiss, And with a flood of transport bless the day Which makes her mine for ever. Day remote, And long to be expected: for not yet Shall pass this world away; nor yet shall come The fun'ral of the globe, tho' earth be old, And oft betray her symptom of decline. No! I have long to tarry ere the morn Of restoration dawn, and many a slow And weary winter must I urge away: Distress and sickness, sorrow, care, and pain, Must I endure alone; shed many tears, Lament for comforts gone, and thro' the dark And dismal cave of dissolution march, Ere I can meet my Isabel again. And even then my pittance of desert Shall ill entitle me her bliss to share, Tho' heav'n be bountiful, and much forgive; Tho' it attribute merits not our own To us who need. Then what is life to me? The cage of discontent, dark prison-house Of sorrow and complaint, which I nor dare To quit, nor hope to dwell in. Happier days Once found me loit'ring, but such days are fled. Yes, I was happier once, and fondly sung Of comforts not dissembled, of my cot, And sweet amusements which attract no more. Methought my song should ever be content, Plac'd by my God where I was richly bless'd, In such a nook of life, that I nor wish'd Nor fancied aught that could have pleas'd me more. So sings the summer linnet on the bough, And, pleas'd with the warm sun-beam, half asleep, The feeble sonnet of supine content To his Creator warbles; warbles sweet, And not contemn'd, till some unfeeling boy His piece unheeded levels, and with show'r Of leaden mischief his ill-utter'd song Suddenly closes: pines the songster then, Wounded and scar'd, flutters from bough to bough, Complains and dies; or lingers life away In silent anguish, and is heard no more. My God, have I arraign'd thee? Let thy bow Ten thousand arrows in this bosom fix, Yet will I own thee just. Take all away; Leave me no friend, but let me weep alone At mute affliction's solitary board. Summon Cecilia to an early grave, And let her tribe of cheerful graces fade, Fast as the flow'r she gathers: let the worm Prey on the roses of Eliza's cheek: Yet will I bless thee. For to this harsh world I came a beggar, but sufficient bread Have never needed; thy indulgent hand Fed and sustain'd me, and sustains me still; Nor feel I hardship which thy partial rod To me alone dispenses: bitter loss, Sorrow and misery o'erflow the cup Of many a soul more innocent than mine. Behold yon village church, whose humble tow'r Stands in a vale between two lofty hills Upon the confines of the winter's flood; There Caroletta sleeps. Poor hapless girl! She saw a daring brother bound in chains, And visited his dungeonâsaw the sword Of angry justice waving o'er his headâ Blush'd for his shameâabsconded from the worldâ Pin'd into sicknessâ and, the culprit dead, Close at his heels went down into the grave. So beauty, virtue, piety, and youth Fell in an instant, and the scythe of time Cut from the root, with one determin'd blow, The noisome thistle and the harmless rose. A rose too delicate and winning fair For the deserted village where it grew, And happily remov'd to bloom in heav'n. Conduct thine eye along that chain of hills, Observe a steeple at the mountain's foot, Girded by woodland; there Aurelia liv'd, And to her happy spouse, the Vicar, bore Six smiling infants. To maturer years Each rose in turn, but, ere the hour was past Which childhood limits, one grew sick and died: Another linger'd, and another fell: A third departed; and thus clos'd the grave On three sweet maidens in the bloom of life: A duteous son then fell, by frenzy seiz'd, Ere education her expensive work Had well accomplish'd, and the letter'd youth Dismiss'd a graduate: yet another liv'd, But liv'd remote upon the Indian shore, Nor there liv'd long, but died: the Vicar then To heav'n was summon'd, and his weeping spouse, With only one poor sickly daughter left, Fled from the vale, and was not heard of more. Then let not me complain, but o'er thy grave, Departed Isabel, my tablet place, And to my hearth return; content that heav'n, Which all might challenge, has yet spar'd me much. âAdieu, sweet maid, whom death untimely smote, âAs eager winter nips the bud of spring, âFor blossoming too early. Here secure, âWhile judgment tarries, in the dust repose, âAnd while, less happy thro' the vale of life, âWe toil in tears without thee. Yet not long âShall death divide us: swift as the dove's wing âShall pass the moments of this changeful stage, âAnd soon our bones shall meet: here will we sleep, âHere wake together, and from hence ascend â(If haply innocence like thine be ours) âTo love which no affliction shall disturb.â Ye kind and cheerful partners of my roof, Receive me once again, and once again, Welcome associates of my humble board, Smile at my entrance, and assuage my pain With pure esteem's reiterated kiss. Cecilia, let thy finger fill my ear With the sweet concord of subduing sounds, Prelude to serious song. Let thy free voice, Eliza, sooth me with some plaintive air, Till peace and comfort fill my breast again. Steal me away from grief, and grief from me. Let not your hearts be sad, tho' on my cheek Dull melancholy dwell, and from my brow Depart reluctant as the low'ring gloom Of mid-November: yet this cloud shall pass, And float away with sensible retreat In the returning sunshine of content. This frown of winter shall again be chas'd By the sweet smile of spring: summer shall come, And joy shall blossom from ten thousand buds, Gay as the nectarine, tho' now its branch Seem to be blasted by a with'ring frost, Never to flourish more. Come then, my loves, Still let improvement be our daily care; And let us rise to this our welcome task Soon as the lark of May, which soars aloft In the first glimpse of morning, and performs A darkling anthem at the gates of heav'n: Let us pursue it, earnest as the bee, Searching the raspberry's unfolded bloom, Which never leaves it till the sun is couch'd, The longest summer's day; yea, travels still, And with the nightingale her strain prolongs E'en in the moon-beam, when the vale is hush'd, And ev'ry idler bird gone home to bed. This be our only care, till waning life Has number'd all its sands: and then one grave Receive us all, and be one only vault The darksome cell of our imprison'd bones. Thither let nature lead us one by one, Nothing despairing, tho' with plenteous tears Haply bewailing intermitted love, As now we weep o'er Isabel deceas'd. No proud inscription memorize the spot, To which our ashes are gone down in hope: But let one unadorn'd and modest stone, Plain and sincere, say only, âHere he lies, âAnd here lie those he lov'd, and those he sung.â Under the altar of yon village church, Which stands upon a hillock in the vale, And looks toward the foamy swelling deep, Close by the side of Isabel so dear, Will we repose together; there to rest, Till at the dawn of everlasting doom The summoning Archangel lift his trump, And blow the dead to life. Then shall we wake To sweet renewal of unceasing love, To surer peace, and union without end. Thou bounteous Author of all human bliss, Give me whatever lot thy wisdom deems Meet and convenientâpleasure, if thou wiltâ If not, then painâand be it sharp as this, My heart, tho' wounded, shall adore thee still. THE FAVOURITE VILLAGE. TO THE REV. JOHN COURTAIL, A.M. ARCHDEACON OF LEWES, THE FOLLOWING POEM, DESCRIPTIVE OF THOSE RURAL SATISFACTIONS AND AMUSEMENTS, TO WHICH, IN THE SPIRIT OF TRUE TASTE, HE HAS, FOR MANY YEARS, GIVEN THEIR DUE PREFERENCE, IS, WITH RESPECT AND VENERATION, AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED. BOOK 1. ARGUMENT OF THE FIRST BOOK. The subject proposed, viz, the pleasures of the VillageâThe Village itself describedâThe pleasure of rural spectaclesâ The peasant's funeralâDescription of the Author's houseâ of the hills near itâand of one lofty eminence in particular âthe prospect from itâThe pleasures of early Summer first describedâthe sight of haymakingâof the bullâof the close of eveningâof the whirlwindâof the thunder-stormâof the country after itâThe pleasure of looking over corn-fields in Julyâof bathing in the seaâof beholding the sea in a storm âduring a calm, &amp;c. Place of my birth, O fondly let me sing Thy pleasures multifarious, pass the sun Through what fair sign it will. Around a pool In a deep vale assemble thy warm huts, All overhung by intermingling elms, Save where the steep-ascending street (if street May yon loose chain of tenements be deem'd) Girds the contiguous hill, roof above roof, And terminates above in farmer's close, Or sawyer's pit with frequent boards beset. Hard by, o'ertopping fair the nether elms, But little shewing of the verdant hill That underprops his columns, stands the Church. A cheerful look athwart the vale he casts, Smiles at the distant ocean half-eclips'd Behind yon sudden intervening down, And blesses the proud eminence, whose steep, For ever flock-fed, shelters his lov'd elms Scatter'd wherever in the vale below. Fast by him stands, and not, like modern dome, To the poor mansion of the Lord of Hosts Abhors propinquity, the rural seat Of one whom Britain hail'd erewhile her chief Of princely ministers, Newcastle's Duke. Pertains to Pelham still the rural spot, Its pious site to his religious mind Convenient, proper. Musing let me pass Thy silent door and unfrequented walks, Mansion deserted, and with pond'ring heart Think, what is greatness in this world below! Where is thy rich possessor, whose warm heart Peopled the vale with his unnumber'd guests; Who spread profusion round the hall within, And to the border of the lawn without? All, all is hush'd. The airy vision's fled. The mighty master and his host of friends Are well nigh melted all into the grave. A shadow are they, an expiring sound, Reverberated oft from hill to hill, Till now but seldom and but faintly heard. Soon must the whole depart, and other names Possess the echo, till their hour is spent, And future tongues 'gin prate of future days. So press we all into the yawning gulf Of vast eternity. These leaning stones, Which gird with cincture ruinous the church, What preach they but of youth and age deceas'd, And sexes mingled in the populous soil, Till it o'erlooks with swoln and ridgy brow The smoother croft below? A little hour, A moment, and the fretful miner Death Shall delve again with implement severe Into the bowels of this restless plot, And bid a generation couch beneath. Say, ancient edifice, thyself with years Grown grey, how long upon the hill has stood Thy weather-braving tower, and silent mark'd The human leaf inconstant bud and fall? The generations of deciduous manâ How often hast thou seen them pass away? How often has thy still surrounding sward Yawn'd for the fathers of the peopled vale, And clos'd upon them all? Thy during fane, How often has it shed the dew of grace On the mute infant, and receiv'd him soon A coffin'd elder silver-lock'd with age? O tell me, rev'rend structure, what events Of awful import on the tide of time Have floated by thee, as the bubble vain? What armies on that distant hill engag'd, To leave those scars of war upon its brow? What blood was shed, and why? and where sleep now The wrathful combatants of either host? Saw'st thou the hill its hungry entrails ope To swallow the pale dead, which reason deems Beneath the still sward slumber of yon mounts? Princes and peoples, (would'st thou make report) Armies and fleets hast thou seen pass away, Transient as vapour; and in thy esteem All things are yesterday and recent change. Speak, thou sage preacher, and, to make me wise, Tell but that ancient secret, where sleeps now He who thy aisles design'd, or they who built? âDeep, deep in earth, nor shall thy life suffice âThe mingled generations to remove, âWhose bones and ashes have envelop'd their's. âThese my profound and monitory bell âAll to their still graves summon'd, as it calls âNow to his narrow everlasting couch âYon villager departed. Ask no more. âEre long I toll for thee. Away, prepare.â Lo the procession! Let me pause intent, And first drink pleasure at the peasant's grave. Humane and christian is the muse, and fond Of ev'ry object, cheerful or sedate, Which rural scenes afford. She nor contemns The nuptial holiday, nor views untouch'd The sad solemnity of rustic woe, What time the white-frock'd mourner slowly moves, And brings with mute reluctance to the grave The dear remains of some departed friend. The decent sheet that overspreads the bier! How well becomes it sorrow neat as their's, Pure, and unsullied by the shameless tear Of wrung hypocrisy! Steel were the heart That could this passing spectacle survey, Nor feel the touch of sympathy within. Me it well pleases to the holy sward To follow pitying, nor disowns my muse The feminine sensations of a heart That often vibrates at another's woe. The tear that trickles down the manly cheek, The burst of grief that braves control, the sigh Which baffles interception, and escapes Soon as the solemn pause bids lift the pall, And ease the dead into his kindred earth, Send many a tingling arrow through this breast, Though the reluctant eye no grief betray, And tearless silence in her deepest gloom The decent pleasurable secret hide. But often as my sated soul surveys The sable funeral of city pomp, Methinks life human is a play indeed, And the poor player man, exhausted, spent, Has made his exit, and now comes the farce. 'Tis pantomimic shewâthe nodding plume, The proud escutcheon'd hearse, and long parade Of dry-eyed mourners clad in inky cloaks, The streaming crape, and dismal aisle behung With sable manufacture ill-applied. To see such idle waste, and childish shew, I smile, and nothing grieve. Not so, when death Calls for the hind, and undissembled grief Of father, widow, offspring, to the grave His decent corpse attends. Then through my soul Exquisite sympathy's vibration thrills; It sorrows freely, breathes the grateful sigh, Nor scorns to utter from a heart subdued The mourner's luxury, the deep âalas!â Enough of painful pleasure. Now alive, Thee let me sing, still mansion of my birth. The swelling instep of the mountain's foot Above the vale just lifts thee. Thy trim gate, Thy candid aspect and pale-chimney'd roof Some eminence bespeak, and mark thee chief Of the lone hamlet that behind thee squats. Thou seem'st a bride, and this thy nuptial day, And these thy mute attendants less attir'd. Graceful to them thy fair ingenuous face And bolder footstep, but not less to thee Their modest air becoming. Ev'ry roof, Or farm or cottage, ev'ry tree and shrub, Pasture and garden-plot, which tread thy heel Descending from the hill, thy charms improve. I see where Flora her full lap of sweets Has strew'd before thee, prodigally kind. I mark the wreath laburnum without hand Weaves for thy brow, the lilac tuft sublime That shades thy temples, and the nodding flowers Of rose and woodbine which his leaf o'ertop, To screen thine eyelids from the western beam. Beauty conceal'd is beauty thrice improv'd; And plainness self, if plainness be thy lot, Is not to be reprov'd, when nature thus Adorns deformity with flowery charm. Welcome, dear mansion of repose and ease, Still nurse of letters. To the studious mind The vale of solitude is world enough; A world of many pleasures, many friends, Of bustle, and resort without fatigue. E'en the slow-marching sabbath, by the gay Devoted ill to frivolous excess, Or dedicated fondly by the grave To endless exercise of pious toil, Has here no hurried and no loit'ring foot. Abridg'd of levity, and indispos'd To make salvation slavery, and yawn Till latest midnight o'er the long discourse, It interdicts not recreation sweet; But, holy worship and the preacher's saw Duly attended, gives to sacred song, To conversation, anthem, slight research, Or loud perusal of ill-printed news, The sacred residue of ambling day. Alone, of men, dwells here the thoughtful bard. Here, on the mountain station'd, to the deep, That proudly thund'ring on his one hand foams, The lyre's indignant chorus sweeps he now; Now to the peaceful variegated weald, That underlies his other, tinkles soft Descriptive admiration of her charms. He sings her every steeple, farm, and field, Till, like the prospect, his expiring song, Mellow'd and soften'd, steals away from sense, And ill-perceiv'd runs melting into air. How awful this proud height, this brow of brows, Which every steep surmounts, and awes sublime The subject downs below! Nature wears here Her boldest countenance. The tumid earth Seems as of yore it had the phrenzy fit Of ocean caught, and its uplifted sward Perform'd a billowy dance, to whose vast wave The proudest surges of the bellowing deep Are little, as to his profounder swell The shallow rippling of the wrinkled pool. Enormous family, gigantic host, Nation of mountains, sublime people, say, At what great festival did your high brows And ample foreheads dignify the dance? When welcom'd ye rebounding the great God In mercy present? Or, if wrath came down, When boil'd so furiously your molten sward, Fus'd at the touch of his indignant foot? When did the God, departing, with a frown Congeal and frost-fix your prodigious limbs, Leaving remembrance, which no time shall 'rase, Of ire omnipotent here dealt around? Or if at first with wonder-working hand He form'd you thus, say where is the vast scoop, By which these ample vales and combs profound Were hollow'd? Where is the stupendous axe Which cleft the shoulders of yon bulky cliffs? Who the vast host of precipices link'd, To fetter frantic ocean to his seat? Where is the mighty delving tool that pil'd High as the clouds this lofty mount supreme, And yon his twin companion, way between To the neat stream permitting, as she trips To wed her sober spouse the tranquil Ouse? Where is the car that bore the hills away To make yon ample basin, bowl immense, Vast amphitheatre of sky-crown'd downs, Where oft the hurried waters lose their way, And spreading wide become an inland sea Land-lock'd by mountains? Where is the strong bar Which loosen'd seaward the contiguous hills, Hove them aside, and gave to Ouse between Sufficient space for his meand'ring stream To wind and wander, and to many a farm, Village, and steeple, visitation pay, Or e'er he pours into the distant deep, Through the wide fauces of yon hiant cliffs, Th' obsequious lake that urges him along? Here let me stand, and wonder at my God, Nor look with insolent disdain on man; Since, feeble as his efforts are, his works Puny and ill-distinguish'd, yet e'en they Add grace and beauty to the noblest scene. What were the deep, if his cerulean swathe Bound only, as a girdle, unadorn'd, The hills that baffle his circumfluent wave? Owes he no beauty to the passing fleet With swelling canvass o'er his steril void Tilting triumphant, intercepted oft By the white promontory's brow sublime, And oft apparent where the cultur'd vale 'Tween cliff and cliff with ample op'ning yawns? Owes he no majesty, when ev'ning sooths The tranquil waters, and dun quiet reigns, To the stout convoy's peremptory flash, Distinct precursor of a voice profound Enforcing mandate not pronounc'd in vain, But soon assembling her disparted fleet; As (if to great things small may be compar'd) Troops to the partridge at her ev'ning call Her scatter'd brood Septembrian, thunder-scar'd? Owes he no grandeur to the warrior bark, With sail impetuous as the falcon's wing Chasing her foe, and blazing from her side The smoky thunder-peal, awhile sustain'd, Awhile replied to, till her ensign couch'd Implies submission and a foe subdu'd? Yes, these have dignity, and much delight, And cheat of length and weariness the way, As from this eminence my foot descends Homeward to roam o'er intervenient hills. Oft on the sunny upland let me pause, That overlooks the hamlet, and, with tube Improving vision to the brow applied, Take my last farewel of the fleet remote, Ere I descend into the vale beneath. With sight still aided let me home survey, Well pleas'd if Madam at her door appear Watching her son's return with double eyes, Twain supplemental, striding o'er the nose, And with affectionate extended arm Clasping the temple and superior ear. Pleas'd also, if but puss upon the sill Be seen adorning, with assiduous tongue Cleansing her taper shank, her dappled coat And furry bosom, or with gentle paw Laving her countenance and hindmost ear. Thus, thou dear village, sometimes let me stand, The ding-dong peal of thy twain bells remote To hear, and see thy Sunday cottager In his white frock, thy scarlet-mantled dame, Thy lusty farmer in his brown surtout, And all thy mingled people, well-attir'd, Church-ward repairing from their scatter'd homes. Prudent assemblers, warmly shall the muse Your piety applaud, and would to God None ever linger'd in the haunts obscene Of lewd ebriety, for ever lost To the still voice of truth; and would to God Of you that hear the word none heard in vain, But all obedient at the holy board Assembled duly at their pastor's call. Would too, that none, preferring draff to grain, On the fond cobler's conventicle drawl With admiration fed, and the full cup Of barbarous intoxication swill'd. My native vale, in loveliness array'd, Now let me paint thee, while the mower's scythe Thine herbage levels, harvest first conferr'd And least solicited, spontaneous gift, Abundance for the beast that toils for man. Thick swarms the field with tedders, tossing high And spreading thin upon the sunny sward The lock dishevell'd. Frequent is the maid That trails the rake, and he that builds the cock, Or, plunging deep his fork in every hill, Bears it aloft uplifted to the load. The team alternate to the peopled rick Moves in procession, soon reliev'd, and soon Alert returning to be fraught anew. Now is it sometimes pleasure to steal forth At sultry midnoon, when the busy fly Swarms multitudinous, and the vex'd herd Of milch-kine slumber in yon elm-grove shade, Or unrecumbent exercise the cud With milky mouths. 'Tis pleasure to approach, And, by the strong fence shielded, view secure Thy terrors, Nature, in the savage bull. Soon as he marks me, be the tyrant fierceâ To earth descend his headâhard breathe his lungs Upon the dusty sodâa sulky leer Give double horror to the frowning curls. Which wrap his foreheadâand ere long be heard From the deep cavern of his lordly throat The growl insufferable. Not more dread And not more sullen the profoundest peal Of the far-distant storm, which o'er the deep, Cloth'd in the pall of midnight premature, At ev'ning hangs, and jars the solid earth With its remote explosion. Tramples then The surly brute, impatient of disdain, And spurns the soil with irritated hoof, Himself inhaler of the dusty cloud, Himself insulted by the pebbly shower Which his vain fury raises. Nothing fear'd, Let him incens'd from agitated lungs Blow his shrill trump acute, till echo ring, And with a leer of malice steal away, Assault and vengeance swearing ere be long. When the bright orb of ruddy eve is sunk, And the slow day-beam takes its last farewel, Retiring leisurely, how sweet to mark The watery scintillation of the star That first dares penetrate its flimsy skirt, And, as the subtil medium steals away Refin'd to nothing, bright and brighter glows! How cheerful to behold the host of night, Encourag'd by example, fast revive, And splendid constellations long extinct In quick succession kindle! Summer's night Yields many a pleasure to the poet's eye. He loves to ramble when the vale is hush'd, What time the preying owl with sleepy wing Swims o'er the corn-field studious, unannoy'd By the fleet swallow to his chimney slunk, Or marten to his eave; what time the bat Hurries precipitous on leathern wing, Brisk evolution in the dusky air With sudden wheel performing. With delight He sees the recent moon with horn acute Fast by the star of ev'ning glow, to grace The crimson exit of departing day; And ever with affection hails her beam, Whether her kindled cheek appear on high, As tranquil twilight dwindles, half illum'd, And, westward tending, down the steep of heaven The chariot of retreating day pursue, Or full-fac'd meet him on yon eastern hill, Veil'd if the sun be present, or with meek Uncurtain'd aspect if his orb be sunk. Or whether, with reverted horn, her bow Look eastward as the break of morning dawns, And hide its slender elegance, abash'd At the bright egress of effulgent day. Yes, the fond poet can with joy behold Eve's dappled vesture in the rosy beam Twice-dyed, and with the ruddier hues of light In fold and border saturated well; A rich illuminated crimson stole With sanguine furbelow of molten gold. With equal transport views his cheerful eye The cloud of morning shot with purple streaks; Nor void of ecstasy observes on high The fleece of silver, in which decent night Scarce veils her smiling orb, betraying oft Through its dishevell'd border transient glimpse Of the pure studded azure, or sweet day Of moonbeam unrestrain'd. Some taste of bliss May haply be deriv'd from lurid night, In dismal weeds of saddest sorrow dress'd, And shedding fast from her maternal eye Afflicted widowhood's celestial tear, If unexpected the rent cloud display The pure cerulean cupola of heaven, With dewy gems serene of ev'ry size And ev'ry lustre sow'd, not faint, nor few, As when the horned moon shines clear, but bright And numberless as the well-winnow'd grain The ploughman scatters, or the silky fall Of the soft vernal show'r that bids it spring, Or dew-drops cherishing autumnal meads. Sometimes the whirlwind's eddy let me see The highway march, and with cylindric tube The worried dust inhaling lift it high, A turbid vortex, swelling as it mounts, And soon dispers'd in the wide field of heaven. Anon the candent thunderbolt delights, That tears the bosom of the sultry cloud, And from its watery lap prone deluge sheds. Let the tempestuous Angel quit his hold Upon the swealing fork, and pour sublime His thund'ring volley through the deep of heaven. With vivid repetition gleam the flash, And ever, as it kindles, sally forth, Abrupt and ruinous, the rolling peal, As if, by lightning lash'd, at ev'ry blaze Shot forth a chariot from the throne of heaven, And headlong bounded o'er the cloudy waste. The storm subsided, and fair day return'd, Up to yon summit, that with haughty grace Its wither'd turban wears of perish'd heath, On its rude forehead, filleted around, Bearing distinct the trench of ancient war, With slow and painful footsteps let me climb. At length ascended, on the central mount, Erewhile perhaps the military throne Of some proud monarch, and the spot rever'd Whence the pavilion'd conqueror survey'd His tented host around him, lost awhile And musing let me stand, to think, where now The leader and his army? prey alike To the none-sparing appetite of time. Then let me feed with never-sated eye Upon the downy prospect wide outspread. It shall not grieve me if the gust be free, And to withstand its overbearing gale I lean upon the tide of air unseen. For pleasant then across the vale below Fleet the thin shadows of the sever'd cloud, Unwearied race performing. The blue deep Wears wrinkled laughter, and exulting bounds The shore along, with sycophantic air Welcoming fashion to her lov'd retreat Yon distant steeple, where she sits and smiles, And dips her foot into the wholesome wave. Thus on the July down in summer's noon Let me lounge often, when the whiffling breeze, The sear hill sweeping, sings among the bents That brush my footsteps, and make brighter still The polish'd sandal and its slippery sole. For then how beauteous lies the vale below, Chequer'd with various harvest, light and shade, As o'er it sails th' unnumber'd cloud of heaven! How whispers, as it stoops, the blooming ear Of the tall wheat-field slenderly erect, And bows obsequious to the passing gale! It seems a troubled sea, that swells, and rolls, And pours its green wave merrily along, Or up the steep, or down the smiling slope, Or o'er the plain, or through the valley's lap. If noon be fervid, and no zephyr breathe, What time the new-shorn flock stands here and there With huddled head, impatient of the flyâ What time the snuffling spaniel, as he runs, Pants freely, and laps often at the brook, To slake the fervour of his feverous tongueâ What time the cow stands knee-deep in the pool, Lashing her sides for anguish, scaring oft, With sudden head revers'd, the insect swarm That basks and preys upon her sunny hideâ Or when she flies with tufted tail erect The breeze-fly's keen invasion, to the shade Scampering madlyâlet me wind my way Tow'rd the still lip of ocean. Seated there, Soon let me cast habiliment aside, And to the cool wave give me. Transport sweet! Pleasure thrice-delicate! Oh, let me plunge Deep in the lucid element my head, And, rising, sportful on its surface play. Oh joy, to quit the fervid gleam of earth, Leave a faint atmosphere, and soon recruit Exhausted energy, suspended thus Upon the bosom of a cooler world! Oh recreation exquisite, to feel The wholesome waters trickle from the head, Oft as its saturated locks emerge! To feel them lick the hand, and lave the foot! And when the playful and luxurious limb Is satiated with pastime, and the man Rises refresh'd from the voluptuous flood, How rich the pleasure to let Zephyr chill And steal the dew-drops from his panting sides! Let e'en the saucy and loud Auster blow, Be but his sea not fierce, nor, save at shore, The frothy breaker of displeasure shew, Yet will I court the turbulent embrace Of thee, thou roaring deep: yes, and will share The bather's richest pleasure, when the foot Of fear might hesitate, nor dare invade The thund'ring downfal of the billowy surge. How joys the bold intruder, then, at large To flounder porpoise-like, wave after wave Mounting triumphant, hoisted by the swellâ How climbs with ease, descends, and climbs again Th' uplifted summit, high as it may seem, Of the sublimest wave! What if lost earth Each moment disappear, as the sunk head Swims through the yawning hollow of the flood; As often shall it greet the watchful eye, Seen from the wave-top eminent. And when Landward with weary stroke the patient arm Oars him again in safety, how alert Shall the strand meet him, and his streaming limbs Rescue from boist'rous ocean's foamy jaws; Defiance bidding to his savage howl, His ivory tooth unsheath'd, his sullen bark, And fiery look delirious, symptoms all Of madness imminent! Lo! as we speak, The wolfish monster kindles into rage! Enormous mastiff, how he gnaws his chain, And struggles to be free, fast bound by fate, And never more to be let loose on man! Aloud he bellows, with indignant paw Dances uprear'd, and menaces the foot Of earth with trembling diffidence protruded. Lo! the saliva of his deafening tongue Her pebbled instep stains! his rugged coat Is whiten'd o'er with foam, wasted amiss In the vain effort of his hoarse assault! Chain'd tyrant, spare thy fury, or unfear'd Growl the long night away. To-morrow's sun Shall find thee gentler, and a second dawn Shall quell thy raving fit, and make thee calm, Tame, and obsequious as the fondest cur That cringing fawns and licks the steps of man. Not such thy frenzy, when the northern gale, Borne softly seaward, the tyrannic surge Here first assuaging, sooths into a smile Thy frantic countenance, thy surly frown Appeases, thy white tooth and snarling jaw Foamy with vengeance closes, and thy tongue Bids spaniel-like with parasitic kiss Lave inoffensive the long peaceful shore. How placid then beneath the midday sun Shines thy pure azure level undisturb'd! How smooth and oily seems the path of Ouse, As unmolested round the western cliff He winds his way, nor mingles with the wave! How steady sails the bark, her every sheet Fill'd with the breeze! how fearless on the brink Of the vast watery field, erewhile so rude, Lets drop her anchor, furls her pliant sail, And waits the hour when thy more lifted plain, And Ouse retiring o'er the perilous bar, Shall bear her smoothly up the brimful port! Nor such thy frenzy, when the breeze at east Round yon tall promontories, you vast chain Of cliffs sublime that gird Britannia's breast, Than which her stedfast rock-encircled waist Owns none more lofty, to the Thames-bound fleet Blows adverse. Safe beneath the muzzled mouths Of yon twin parapets, whose weighty tubes Menace the deep below, they moor secure, And ride expectant of the prosp'rous gale. Oft from yon hill superior let me see The peaceful anchorage of this wide bay Thus by the wind-bound mariner posses'd; And chiefly, when the natal hour of George Revolves well welcome in the wheel of time. What pleasure then to number one by one, Floating in honour of the regal day, Their lifted ensigns! to behold more near On either parapet its furnish'd staff Superbly waving; on the western fort, That from the cliffy precipice down looks, And war-locks imminent the mouth of Ouse, His standard flaming; while the port beneath On every stern a silken meteor shews! How marks exulting then th' impatient eye Where blazes first the sulphur-breathing tube Redundant cloud forth sending, unctuous smoke, Ere long succeeded by explosion vast: Earth-shaking gratitude, which bark to bark Kindles in turn, till every deck is lost In brief eclipse of its own thund'ring cloud! BOOK II. ARGUMENT OF THE SECOND BOOK. The pleasures of the favourite village during Autumnâthe sight of harvest and its toilsâof the shepherd digging bird-coops âof gleanersâof harvest still protracted in the flat countryâof the midnight storm in harvest-timeâof the harvest-moon rising. The pleasure of walking home late at night at this seasonâof spending the evening at homeâof walking out early in the morning of Septemberâof listening to the droneâof pitying the broodâof hearing the equinoctial gale by nightâof climbing the cliff the following morning âof viewing the sea troubled as well as calm. Contemplations on the fall of the leaf. Let Summer 'gin decline, yet pleasure still Shall with the poet dwell. Be the field brown: No longer now stand smilingly erect The bearded ear, or spike of nobler grain, But, sear alike, droop both, and hang the head, And stoop the shoulder, to their annual toil The keen hook calling and voracious scythe. How groans the soil with its incumbent load! Lo! in my native vale the reaper's hand Gathers the fruitful ear and binds the sheaf, Betimes industrious, nor its endless task Quits till the moon above the shadowy down Lifts her bright orb to light him to repose. Let morning dawn, and ev'ry village-team Comes forth to bear, or to the rick, or grange, The shocks of plenty in arrangement meet Along the bristly stubble-field dispos'd. All hands are busy, and one common spring Of lively int'rest actuates the scene. Rous'd by example, industry at home The secret impulse of endeavour feels, And toils alert. The very shepherd churl, Accustom'd in the rear of his slow flock To creep inert, or lean upon his crook In vacant contemplation, or recline And with his curs upon the mountain bask, Puts on agility, digs his long line Of turf-turn'd coops along the sunny brow, Trims the slight springe of hair, and neatly hides Beneath the hollow'd sward his double noose. So when the sever'd cloud of airy day Flits through the blue expanse, and the bright orb Wraps often in the veil of brief eclipse, The tim'rous wheatear, fearful of the shade, Trips to the hostile shelter of the clod, And where she sought protection finds a snare. Poor heedless simpleton, to shun a foe Void of annoyance, and destruction seek Where danger least was fear'd. Seiz'd by the springe, She flutters for lost liberty in vain, A costly morsel, destin'd for the board Of well-fed luxury, if no kind friend, No gentle passenger, the noose dissolve, And give her to the free-born wing again. Incautious bird, such as thy lot is now, Such once was mine. By his arch foe beguil'd, Man slipt into the toil, and pitiless death Had in its strong chain bound him. Yet found he A kind Deliverer, who burst his bonds, And the vast price of restoration paid. Divine Preserver, thine immense desert Shall my fond hand at distance imitate, And to the feath'ry captive give release, The pence of ransom placing in its stead. Go, fool, be cheated of thy wing no more. Freedom is thine, and pleasure lives with me. Yet, though it cheat the wheatear of its life, Condemn not thou, my muse, the sullen cloud Which often quenches in its gloomy folds The sultry beam of day, assuaging shade, To him that reaps, and him that wields the scythe, Or plies the fork, or builds the load, or trails The ling'ring rake embarrass'd, at high noon Affording freely. Opportune the shield His canopy bestows; and shelter'd thus Toil becomes nimble, industry alert, And the wide field re-echoes with the sound Of merriment indulg'd, and not repress'd By Autumn's suffocating heat intense. The treader of the mow enjoys within The mitigated air, nor finds the grange A melting oven, by the sultry load Fresh from the field with double heat supplied, Till Hell seem present, wanting but its flames, And thirst insatiable his dusty lip And strangled fauces without mercy parch. Now let the reaper, tawny with his toil, Cut with unwearied hook and eager grasp The last unlevell'd acre, and enjoy To see the village street pour forth its dames And laughing little ones, to glean at large Where'er the huddled sheaf once stood erect. How glows the heart to dwell upon the scene, When harvest thus enlivens every field That girds the hamlet round, when sport and toil Seem hand in hand, and pleasure lives with all! Thy early grain, my native valley, hous'd, Still with protracted pleasure the fond bard Surveys the weald, on whose more chilly lap Brown harvest loiters. With recruited joy Marks he the fervent bustle of the field, And greets anew the sickle, and the swain, Who, to his fair shirt peel'd, from dusky dawn To latest twilight gathers the full ear, And reaping fills, or girding plants erect The multitudinous sheaf. How full of cheer, Joyous, devout, and grateful is the soul, To see again its unexhausted God Thus pile the table of a world with bread! For what's the globe on which we all subsist? The table of immortal bounty 'tis, A feast perpetual, where unnumber'd sons Sit down to banquet as their sires withdraw, And in succession generations feed, Contented rise, give thanks, and pass away. Awful the pleasure now, if midnight storm Illuminate with quick repeated flash Valley and hill, to catch a sudden glimpse Of tree and hedge-row, village, field and shock, Dancing in lightning's transitory gleam: To see the thunderbolt with fiery arm Arrest the mountain top, and sweal his brow, While round the sultry theatre of heaven The peal impatient rides, and steeds of gloom Whirl his benighted car from pole to pole. Be night serene, and her fair moon replete, And other pleasures shall the bard attend. Planet of harvest, oft in the dun east Thy full autumnal orb let me behold As from a furnace rising red with heat, And, while it mounts the purple steep of heaven, Glowing more ardent, till it seem to reach The point of fusion, and, suspended high, A globe intense of molten bullion hang Amid the gems of night. And let me hear, As thy dim orb above th' horizon swells, The shout of harvest-home, the loud huzza, The natural hallelujah of the clown, His chorus of thanksgiving for release. Now let me mark civility's arrears Where'er recorded, and repay at eve The long-due visit to the distant friend, That, by the full orb lighted, I may march Mute and contemplative at leisure home. Mild be the temp'rature of heav'n, serene The silent atmosphere. Let fancy deem She feels the moon-beam warm. Be nothing heard, Save the far-distant murmur of the deepâ Or the near grasshopper's incessant note, That snug beneath the wall in comfort sits, And chirping imitates the silvery chink Of wages told into the ploughman's palmâ Or gentle curlew bidding kind good night To the spent villager, or e'er his hand The cottage taper quenchâor grazing ox His dewy supper from the savoury herb Audibly gatheringâor cheerful hind From the lov'd harvest feast returning home, Whistling at intervals some rustic air, Or at due distance chanting in the vale Exhilarated song. Such rural sounds, If haply notic'd by the musing mind, Sweet interruption yield, and thrice improve The solemn luxury of idle thought. Oft at yon huddled town, that guards remote The sounding ship-yard and contiguous port, By sweet civility detain'd, the bridge, At such late hour returning, let me pass; What time aloft the moon, no more rotund, Shines gibbous o'er the pure and still expanse Of tide-uplifted Ouse, and lends to Night An ample mirror, where her sober eye, Her twinkling jewelry and face serene Thrice placid and thrice beauteous, may behold. If not abroad I sit, but sip at home The cheering beverage of fading eve, By some fair hand, or e'er it reach the lip, With mingled flavour tinctur'd of the cane And Asiatic leaf, let the mute flock, As from the window studious looks mine eye, Steal foldward nibbling o'er the shadowy down, And take their farewel of the savoury turf. Let the reluctant milch-kine of the farm Wind slowly from the pasture to the pail. Let the glad ox, unyok'd, make haste to field, And the stout wain-horse, of encumbrance stript, Shake his enormous limbs with blund'ring speed, Eager to gratify his famish'd lip With taste of herbage, and the meadow brook. To him who in the beam of morning walks, How lovely blossoms the September rose, Which, unexpected, 'mid his flow'rless shrubs Unfolds its blushing solitary bud, Humid with autumn's equinoctial tear, And, bowing with the gale, the treasur'd dew Sheds in abundance from its leaning cup! To him not pleasureless, as o'er the down He roams contemplative, the mystic spot Where fable dreams the midnight fairies dance, A ring of deepest verdure, thick beset With mushrooms rosy-gill'd and cloth'd in snow, Seats for the wearied fay perhaps, minute, If ample, tables for the royal feast Of Mab and Oberon. Such poor account Gives baffled reason, in her childish mood, Of the mysterious cause that wields unseen The compasses of heaven, and circumscribes The free fantastic circle of the hill. Not without pleasure hears the bard the voice Of drone inert, from the rich hive dismiss'd, Seeking apartments in the riven wall Of some old edifice, and sounding loud His drowsy horn at the convenient mouth Of auger-hole profound, his best retreat, There long to sleep, and winter's storm defy. Not such delight affords the senseless fowl, Which now, with sedulous maternal care, Her brood of twitt'ring little ones leads forth, And fondly cautions. Grievous is the sight, However welcome when soft spring prevails, Now to behold her from the secret nest The cheerful troop conducting. Silly bird! It is the sun of autumn, not of prime, Whose fost'ring beam invigorates awhile Thy happy race. 'Tis not the smile of May, But faint October flattery, soon fled. Or e'er to-morrow's sun in clouds descend, The show'ry occident's o'erwhelming gust Thee and thy hover'd train shall almost drown, Be shelter'd as thou wilt. And if thou 'scape The deluge prone-descending, the keen North Shall pinch them bitterly; for now the breeze The morning blush provokes on beauty's cheek, And nature's own inimitable rose Gives to the human face angelic charms. Unwelcome howls the equinoctial gale To him who hears it on his orchard floor Shower the midnight apple or the pear. But not unwelcome to the pilfering boy Blows the rude hurricane, who pockets snug The batter'd windfall, whether pear or plum, Apple or walnut, and in secret feasts; Nor to the swine, perchance, who shares his spoil, Or finds beneath the oak a plenteous meal Of acorns thrash'd and winnow'd by the gale. Nor more unwelcome howls the storm to me. Pleasant the hearth and converse snug within, While the nocturnal tempest raves without, For entrance buffeting the sash in vain; And while the sullen show'r from the drench'd eaves Drips fast, and on the flooded pavement spanks. In such a night, who feels not Heav'n his friend, To bless him with a warm secure abode Impervious to the blast and chilly show'r? Who feels it not vast privilege, to sit And court the glowing embers of his hearth, Till at his bidding their aspiring flames Illuminate and cheer his farthest room? Who deems it not rich pleasure, then, to read By the clear taper unannoy'd, or sweep The strings of harmony unvex'd, and hear At ev'ry pause the persevering storm Rave at his window, in his chimney howl? Who thinks his lot unhappy, then, to sup At an ill-furnish'd board, whose only fare Springs from the dairy and the winnow'd floor? Who deems not shelter and a crust a feast, To the hard fate of him who plods without Fatigued and weather-foil'd, or his more hard Who wrestles with inclement skies above And tossing seas beneath, nor dares retire, Fearful of shipwreck, till the dawn returns? Is he not lapp'd in Paradise, who thinks, Ere slumber close his eyes, how others toil, While peace and comfort curtain him around? If morn, attended by the storm, awake, Glad let me mount the cloud-invading cliff, Which from the hollow of the vale beneath Suddenly springs, as if Britannia here First rose insurgent on the tyrant deep, And her vast limbs to his assault oppos'd. There let me mark the conflict, from above, When, by the tempest aided, Ocean sacks And wears the precipice with giant war: When the grim thunder-cloud assault upholds, And with his forky bolt and roaring peal E'en to its base the cloven mountain shakes. There also let me sometimes stand, when peace Reigns in the vale below, and view well-pleas'd The quiet element that smiles beneath, Image of patience, as the cygnet's down Gentle and inoffensive. Far extends, And far as it outstretches lies unmov'd The marble flood, a spacious pavement, smooth And fairly polish'd. 'Tis the floor of heaven, Which none but God's own foot presumes to tread. Tide of the falling leaf, let others sing Of thy ten thousand tints; I love them not. Oft as I mark upon the woody vale The hue rubiginous of fast decline, I sigh to think how soon the lovely scene Shall pass away, how soon the whiffling gale Shall strip its faded honours from the grove, And whirl them in its tyrant mood aloft, Or idly sweep and hurry them along Through park and paradise, or urge them fierce Into the dank and solitary pit. Yes, I could wail aloud, shed very tears, And stamp for anguish at a scene like this. Once only loves my soul to see the gale Seize the dry leaf, and worry it alongâ When the dwarf oak, that all the winter through Has stood tenacious of its wither'd pride, And the sear beech, of its old whisp'ring spoils Alike retentive, sheds them to the breeze, Erelong intending to be fairer cloth'd, And with more lovely foliage grace the wood. I could thy persecution then enjoy, Thou playful gust, that hurries from my sight The perish'd leaf of the departed year. I could the ling'ring fugitive pursue, Howl after him like thee, and bid him hide His ugly aspect in the darksome cave. But shall I join thee now, or praise the cry Which hastens Autumn to an early fall, Which ruins elegance, and rural pride, And all the eye and all the heart adores Of beauty that adorns the summer vale? No, let me mourn thy rapid tyranny, That lays the prospect waste, and bid thee urge With more becoming zeal the loit'ring steps Of uncouth Winter, shrugging at the blast, And slow approaching with frost-bitten heel, Step after step, from his cold Arctic cell.

The pleasures of the favourite village during WinterâAmusing presages of stormy weatherâThe winter tempest described, as a cause of pleasureâthe agitated seaâits invasion of the Parish-clerkâThe pleasure of viewing the port and its mercantile laboursâReflections on the sun and moonâPleasures of the Winter's morningâof the Winter's walkâthe rainbow &amp;c.âFrost and its pleasuresâthe clear-shining moonâ the rime, and its thawâboys slidingâReflections on the power of frostâThe fall of snowâits intermissionâits final cessationâThe pleasure of walking out when it has subsided, and observing various animalsâChristmas and its pleasures âthe boy singing carolsâThe return of fog and thawâgradual disappearance of the snowâPleasure of viewing the leafless woodâAgreeable symptoms of spring not far distant, seen in different flowersâin the improving warmth of the sunâin the length of the days. The pleasure of walking in the sunshineâand observing the first bloom that begins to appear. Yet Winter has its pleasures. 'Tis delight To mark the symptom of his frequent storm. Not seldom, previous to the morrow's shower, A flaky vapour the pure Ã¦ther streaks; As if some painter of gigantic arm Had dipp'd his brush into the foamy wave, Charg'd it with colour from the cliff, and dash'd With wanton levity a milky bow Across the dome of heav'n. Nor sometimes seems His saucy hand with single stroke content, But daubs with quick return the azure arch, Upon the blessed canopy sublime Vagaries flourishing, unsteady freaks, Such, with her besom, round the morning hearth, As giddy bar-maid fashions, trailing brisk Her childish fancies o'er the sanded floor. If yet the season to his race be kind, Sharp stings the minor fly, chirurgeon keen, With lancet petulant the manly shin Provoking, oft repuls'd, nor slaking well His thirst of blood, ere the vindictive hand Of his vex'd patient fall, and with a frisk The small phlebotomist indignant crush. Forth from her haunt obscene, offensive sight! Wanders Arachne, sable, filthy, vast. Forth creeps the ling'ring snail; a silvery line, Meand'ring devious o'er the plaister'd wall, Marks his pituitous and slimy course. With tardy shell and tender horn outstretch'd He seeks the far-off leaf. Aloud and oft The cock high-mounted with applauding wing Sounds his clear trump, prophetic of the show'r; While the daw people numerous, with plumes Rapid and audible, the valley skim Or flock-fed down, or round the steeple sail, Startling by fits the meditating ear With mingled outcry of ten thousand throats. Tight stretch'd, where'er suspended, or in croft, Or sunny garden, or contiguous field, Appears the cord the busy laundress strains. Far off resounds the shore-assailing deep, Sweeping with rude concussion the loose beach Harshly sequacious of his refluent surge. Sails landward, high uplifted, the grey host Of wide-wing'd sea-mews, in their gyrous flight Oft intermingling, and repeating oft Sounds which the distant inexperienc'd ear Might deem the cry of eager hounds remote. Loud on the brink of her foul puddle quacks The clam'rous duck, while her more silent lord, With his green glossy nape, assiduous oils His shining beak, and spreads the thin defence With nice precision o'er his thirsty plumes. So falls the shower in vain, and he secure Stalks in the deluge, and defies it all, The fine dew trickling from his sides unfelt; Nor needs, like chanticleer and his vex'd dames, To hurry homeward when the flood descends, To hang the tail, or seek the shed forlorn, And shake the moisture from his madid wings. Nothing impair'd, with clean and ruddy leg Through ev'ry plash he wades, with chatt'ring beak Fishes the miry shallow as he goes; Or strays at large upon the dewy mead In quest of snail, of slug, and winding worm; Or, launching from the shore his feather'd fleet, Pilots his dames along the flooded dyke. As, when the daw throng on the steeple perch, Ambitious of its loftiest vane, and smoke Shot upwards from the funnel mounts erect, Fair day succeeds; so when the turbid stream, That issues from the chimney, falls depress'd, And travels fog-like o'er the dewy field, While at a distance the loud western-bell Distinctly sings, day foul and pluvious comes. Dim the nocturnal sky; its feebler lights Lost in the dense profound, its brighter gems Obscurely visible. If chance the moon Cross the quench'd Empyrean, her sad orb Shines with abated beam, and seems to wear A misty atmosphere. Far in the void An ampler circle with capacious zone Her central disc encloses. Spiritless At his round table sits the farmer lord; A drowsy yawn his pipe-inhaling jaws Relaxes often. At his foot the cur Sleeps on the hearth outstretch'd, and yelping dreams, Or lifts his head, astonish'd at the dance Of frisking puss, who on the sanded floor Gambols excessive. Such ere close of day Were the wild antics of the frantic herd, (Alike prophetic of the morrow storm,) Who leap'd and rac'd, and bellow'd in the mead, And clash'd their horny foreheads, staring fierce. Dim in the socket burns the sulky wick, Nor heeds the trimming hand, which oft divides The kindled fibres of its nape in vain, And to the oil redundant, that would drown Its feeble flame, relieving sluice affords. At length the long-expected tempest comes. His ancient phrenzy has the maniac deep Seiz'd, and with loud reverberating foot He dances rampant in his thund'ring hall. His gloomy frown that darkens earth and heaven, And foamy gnashing jaw, foretel ere long Madness enormous to ensue. E'en now He gnaws with keen exasperated tooth The rock that holds him shorebound to his seat, Buffets the pier and basis of the cliff, Seizes the tilting triple-masted bark, Light as a feather in his pow'rful grasp, Kindles her sleeping thunder, and enjoys Her frequent flashes of nocturnal woe. Well nigh omnipotent, on the sunk reef, Where roars the conflict of eternal storm, And wave o'ertumbles wave in foamy fall, He tosses furious her reluctant crew, Snatches the quiver from the hand of heaven, Scatters the glaring lightnings o'er their heads, And pours the forceful thunder-peal around. Pleas'd at her fate, he aggravates the storm, Bellows profound, roars horrible delight, And bids the billow oft repeat the blow, Till with unchainable gigantic arm He thrusts her headlong to the deepmost Hell. What greater pleasure, thou terrific deep, Than when thy lifted tide proclaims aloud The lunar orb renew'd, or at its hour Of plenitude arriv'd, on thy bleak verge To stand observant of the tumbling swell, Enormous cataract from cliff to cliff Thund'ring along indignant! High in air Flashes the plunging downfall as it flies. Its foamy vengeance to the topmost shore Impetuous rushes, but ere long recedes, Raking with harsh recoil the pebbly steep, And scarce submitting to the monstrous surge That next uplifts its overtumbling swell, And flound'ring hurries o'er the wave relaps'd. Feel'st thou no pleasure that thou sitt'st aloof To whine and shudder, Frisk? There quake and pine, Nor come obedient when thy master's lip Kind invitation whistles, ill agreed Sprawling aloft to meet the salient wave. Not such thy spirit, when insulted puss Scampers the garden path, and climbs alert The high espalier, there to swell and swear, Or, in close corner pent, upheaves her coat, And blust'ring cuffs thee with vindictive claw. Nor such thy spirit, when the nimble hare Starts from her seat, and scuds along the down; Or when thy delicate and busy sense Traces the covey in the morning dew, Which sudden rises, and with whirring wing And chuckling outcry hurries down the vale. The winter sea's insufferable fall Who not admires, and his surmounting wave, Proudly rebellious, when the sable reef Or foamy shallow intercepts his march? How wrestles with the rock the billowy tide! How storms with wanton fury the worn cliff! How on the solid everlasting shore Pours its loud cataract of thunder down! Oft in that perilous and stormy hour, Upon the farthest pier, whose daring pile Strides far into the flood, and braves the surge Of the wild ocean in its angriest mood, In tremulous enjoyment let me stand; What time the gale with clamour-laden wing Blows stiff and ill resisted, dashing fierce The wave prodigious on his oaken breast, Or smites oblique his everlasting side, His chain of ribs enormous, show'r profuse Of the vex'd waters on his lofty chest Heavily pouring. Then who stands to see Must ill-defended shrink within the verge Of the strong work that shudders at the blow, And undercreep the cope high overblown Of vaulting waters, or abide ill-pleas'd Bath instantaneous in a drown'd surtout. Thou awful element, my soul adores Thy furious hour, and with excessive joy Marks thine invasion, when the grasp of God Quits its restraint upon the turbid swell, And pours almighty to the topmost strand In deluge mountainous the milky surge. How hurries headlong the tumultuous tide, At that dread moment, through his foamy jaws Into the mouth of Ouse! how spreads around Its dying wave within the flooded port! Forlorn and waterlock'd stands the lone mill In the mid-lake apparent, close besieg'd, By fearful inundation girded round. Then with what joy, thou proud uplifted deep, Turn I to look upon thy glorious wave, That tumbles, foams, and thunders round the bay! The mighty downfall, forcing from its seat Th' incalculable pebble, piles it high, Against it swells, and swelling upward heaves With shoulder irresistible the mound, Till the controlling moon bids haste away, And rage indignant upon other shores. Then leisurely withdraws the flound'ring surge, And a chaste cestus of unsullied beach, Of ev'ry feculence and foulness purg'd, The waist of ocean girds. How battles then The furious Ouse conflicting with the wave! How rears his waters, and the saucy swell Insulting buffets, overpow'rs his wrath, And headlong hurries the disorder'd flood! The main retiring plays along the shore; As sports the giant whale with the salt wave, Inhaling and again repelling quick The life-supporting tide, so sucks the deep With repercussion harsh the pebbly beach Into his foamy jaws, and so dispels. By the strong action of his forceful lungs The flint itself, made sleek, becomes rotund, And silky to the touch: the very rock, Hard-hearted though he seem, is smooth'd without; And the soft pebble, by collision worn, No angular asperity betrays. Not always innocent the stormy tide, That thus, ascending from the chas'd abyss, Bellows tremendous. In the watery flat, Under the shelter of the mill-pool wall, Behold yon humble and succinct abode. There dwelt of late response-pronouncing sage, The village-clerk parochial, nothing rich. Forty long years he delv'd into the soil, Threw up the crumbled bone and lipless scull, Shap'd to the coffin his well-finish'd work, And eas'd into the grave the silent corpse, Commending dust to dust. Still sprang anew The transient offspring of deciduous man, And still by his all-overwhelming spade Were shelter'd deep beneath the holy sward. Thrice fell his pulpit lord, and he, who sheds Now on each infant cheek baptismal dew, In his long recollection was a child Borne but a day since to the font himself. There liv'd the sage, there died. But ere he died, Strong blew the southern gale; the naked branch Loud howling wrestled with the pow'rful gust, And ocean wroth his terrifying voice Utter'd profound. The shore-assailing wave Uplifted swell'd prodigious, and his bound With foamy far-shot indignation scal'd. The practicable breach, by lunar aid, O'erflowing Ouse in his surmounted wall Ere long effected, and the valley swam. Distress acute the pious houshold seiz'd, To see their supellectile treasures float In playful dance around, to see the flood Yet rushing inward, and the hissing grate Now quenching, filling now the mouth Of oven seldom fed, and now the small And lowly casement laving with its wave. Despair of safety by ascent was there; For ah! the low-roof'd messuage above earth No story boasted, and no stair-way own'd. Drown'd was the tenement, and almost drown'd The holy habitant. But wreck was none, Save of domestic chattels, here and there In culinary whirlpool swimming few. So battled ocean with the tuneful sage. Not such thine enterprize, indignant flood, When, by the resolute shore-shaking God To battle summon'd, thine imperious surge With tow'ring deluge the victorious host Of stone-stunn'd Hector to his Troy repuls'd. The sight of Winter's superb ocean left, Me pleases much the bustle of the port; The toil and clamour of the prosp'rous bark, Safe landing on the wharf with brisk dispatch Her sable cargo from the northern mine: The neater vessel her capacious lap Filling with grain, or (stowage ponderous) The mealy sack of the contiguous mill, Welcome supply to the far-distant camp, Or wind-bound fleet of war; the slothful barge Slug-like conveying from the sloop her deals, Another from the sloven brig her load Of nauseous grocery, abundant store For ev'ry village on the banks of Ouse, And chiefly for yon borough built in air, Whose ancient castle lifts its brow sublime To frown upon the flood they cross below. Brief is the day, but, shorten'd as it is, Sweet meditation to the muse affords. Long on the sullen forehead of the morn The frown of darkness dwells, prolonging night, And gloomily reluctant breaks the dawn. The cock, impatient, for the morning calls; And now the dismal orb of slumb'ring day With melancholy visage through the gloom Scarce penetrates, and sickly twilight sheds. Feeble the splendor of his moody smile, And soon his race concludes. He seems at length, Fatigued by journeying six thousand years, To ask his promis'd sabbath, pants for rest, And early seeks his inn. Not such the speed And nightly progress of his sister orb; She, cheerful and alert, soon as his ray Is quench'd in ocean, rises from her bed, And with affectionate protracted beam Strives to compensate for his absent light. Round the cerulean firmament of heaven She walks, an ample circuit, second day, Inferior hardly to the shorter first, Through the long night dispensing. He his head Lifts from his maritime cloud-curtain'd couch, Surveys, disdaining competition still, Her amiable effort, droops again, And longer sleeps inert. And some there are, Who, dwelling far remote on Arctic plains Buried in snow eternal, his pure orb See never now, or see but half emerge, Recumbent ere it rise, or share alone The feeble twilight of his disc depress'd, Which once a day illuminates unseen The horizontal verge of endless night. To them the moon, immeasurably kind, Sinks never, but with everlasting march, Waxing and waning 'mid the stellar host, The cynosure encircles. Heaven there Seems a vast dome, whose change-performing orb And brilliant host of ever-living gems, Hung on the boreal star that shines alone Fast-fix'd and vertical, swim round and round, And never, weary of their whirling dance, Quit the celestial cupola sublime, To seek refreshment in the gelid wave. Such vast benevolence, sweet orb, is thine. Nor, trust me, can inferior love of man Be to her brother orb imputed. Both Are the sweet progeny of one above, Whose name is Bounty, and inherit both, Twin-born, the boundless goodness of their sire. Their business here is to enlighten man, Else void of eyesight, and his needful bread Cherish with kind invigorating beam. On this their gracious task intent toil both, Incessant labourers, and never pause, As fancy deems, o'erwearied with fatigue, Or sleep, or ask relief. When he the zone, That girds the waist of earth, with northward march Crosses refulgent, and his sister meets, He bids her with a smile this Arctic world Quit, and illuminate the pole below, Her day prolonging as he shortens his. So when his blazing chariot flames on high To rear the northern harvest, she depress'd Lightens the frosty hemisphere beneath, To us apparent little, long withdrawn. She knows that summer's night needs not her beam, Contracts her feeble day, and soon retires, Because her ardent helpmate soon returns. And when again with retrogressive car He journeys southward, and the fancied belt Of earth repasses, with fraternal kiss He bids her hasten to the wint'ry north, While he dispenses to Antarctic realms, That will not mourn her absence, sweet return Of blossom, foliage, fruit, and food. Such now His task benevolent. To us alone He seems subdued by sloth. For while on high Her everlasting lamp his sister hangs, To light a frozen world he seems to scorn And visit with reluctance, he below Reigns bountiful, and with indulgent beam Bids plenty flourish to the farthest pole. Such are thy bounteous children, bounteous sire, Such thy twain dutiful obedient orbs, Which thus to all mankind, by night, by day, Whatever season rules whatever clime, Distribute equal portions of thy love. Not pleasureless the morn, when dismal fog Rolls o'er the dewy plain, or thin mist drives; When the lone timber's saturated branch Drips freely, and with large redundant drop The spread umbrella pelts, which the chill'd tooth Screens, and o'ercanopies the languid lock. Shorn of his glory, through the dim profound With melancholy aspect looks the orb Of stifled day, and while he strives to pierce And dissipate the slow reluctant gloom, Seems but a rayless globe, an autumn moon, That gilds opaque the purple zone of eve, Nor yet distributes of her thrifty beam. Lo! now he conquers; now, subdued awhile, Awhile subduing, the disparted mist Yields us a brighter beam, or darker clouds His crimson disc obscure. Through the thin veil Of his foul mantle reads the bard, well-pleas'd, A kindling glimpse of the pure azure field Of heav'n's unbounded champain, and the hour Of winter's noon serene with inward joy Greets ere it bless his sight. To him who walks Now in the shelter'd mead, loud roars above Among the naked branches of the elm, Still fresh'ning as the hurried cloud departs, The strong Atlantic gale. Not louder falls The foamy lasher's cataract superb In fullest flood-time, when impatient Thames Fights with the lock which chains him to his seat, And strives to burst his manacles in vain. Yet not devoid of pleasure is the field, Howe'er the gale may buffet, nature still Some grateful objects yielding to the sight. Though brown the common with its wither'd fern, And sad the valley with its leafless wood, Yet crimson haws, and hips of ruddy hue, And cluster'd privet-berries, dark as jet, The cheerful hedge-row sprinkle. Lo! the plant, Joy of the traveller yclep'd, or beard Of old man seldom razor'd, lusty still, Though neighbour'd by the prickly bramble, smiles, The long lane whitening with its woolly tufts. Beneath it mark a sear'd and cindery spot, Which scatter'd straws encompass. There encamp'd The last night's wearied vagrant, mumbled there His mildew'd maintenance by whining earn'd; There quaff'd the cup his tatter'd female brew'd, And slept profound upon the musty truss. Fool! to prefer such execrable fare, Such vile accommodation, to the bread Of pious toil, and comfortable hut, Where Industry around the glimm'ring hearth Her never-ailing progeny convenes, And sober Labour, her well-wearied spouse, His ev'ning meal enjoys, or sits refresh'd And hums his rustic sonnet, as he jogs The laughing little-one on either knee. Fool! to be vagabond and rather beg, While his loud hussey, in her cobbled suit Of sulphur redolent and of the green And sobbing ember of the smoky hearth, Screams through the village miserable song, Vendress of ballads and the bundled match. Not distant far the river-swelling show'r, If after blust'ring day come tranquil night, And, ere the morning dawn, clothe marsh and mead In the hoar coverlet of snowy frost. Clear though the glowing orb of day ascend, Pale watery radiance shall it shed around, And soon be muffled by the creeping cloud, That with it bears the tempest, wind and hail, Or copious show'r aslant of pelting rain. Oft though he smile, as often shall he frown; And when at last he takes a sweet farewel, And sinks into the blue and billowy main, The beauteous bow shall, by his beam impress'd, Glow on the bosom of the cloud that flies. O beautiful display, rejoicing sight, How elegant the pleasure drawn from thee! Soft be the breath of heav'n, and through the clear Transparent atmosphere distinctly shine The beauteous landscape, its remotest hill Unveiling of the blue ethereal mist, Which distance o'er the faded prospect draws; What surer symptom of approaching fall? Of rains to be renew'd? But what if day Should sob and whimper, and the sullen show'r Draw its dense curtain o'er the dewy hill, While glutted earth her quiv'ring puddle shews Vex'd by the pattering show'r? While the soak'd thatch Drips hasty from the barn, and while the shoot, Gushing precipitous with bounding spout, Its clinking reservoir the hollow pipe Fills merrily, within from pen or page Sweet satisfaction may the bard derive. Meantime the hov'ring flood spreads wide his wings, And, fix'd in firm array, with leafless heads, In his mid-waters stand the root-bound files Of wretched willow. Soon as morn returns, The sportsman's tube, disglutted o'er the lake, Pours a long echo pealing as it flies. Keen blows the wind, and frosty night ensues. The hearth burns clear, and a blue lambent flame Plays round its glowing embers. Ill endures The limb protruded its shin-piercing power, And the scorch'd eyelid intervention asks Of handkerchief uplifted, doubled news, Hand ill at ease, or tipsey-footed screen. The fev'rous kettle with internal coil And ebullition totters on the bars, Forth sending furious from its brazen lungs Intense evaporation, fog and dew Instinct with fire, to hand that dares approach Intolerable as the parching gust Sirocco, from the burning desert blown. With folded feet inverted slumbers puss The livelong ev'ning on the quilted hearth, Or warmer knee, caress'd and often strok'd, Till gratitude awakes and lulls the ear With drowsy murmurs of internal praise. Look but abroad, and lo! the cheerful moon, Long since ascended from her cloudy couch, High over head presides. Frost-loving Queen, At winter's midnight how intense the grace Which thy pure globe displays! The sullen sun, How fled he discontent, a little curve His hasty march describing, a few hours Quenching his feeble beam! But thy clear orb Delights to linger o'er a frozen world. How sweetly rose it o'er yon woody hill, How gaily smil'd upon the tranquil flood, Seen from the bridge that overstrides the vale, And now how glows it in the midst of heaven! Methinks, I feel thy beam. My heart at least Is warm'd, is melted by thy sovereign ray. And oh! like thee, that ev'ry friend we own Were most indulgent in an hour like this. Beautiful art thou; and if thou art fair, How fair is He whose wonder-working hand Thy beauty fram'd! If to thy lovely orb I almost bow and hail thee as divine, What adoration would my soul o'erflow, Might I the cloud that curtains Him around Withdraw, and see him beauteous as he is? Fountain of elegance, unseen thyself, What limit owns thy beauty, when thy works Seem to possess, to faculties like mine, Perfection infinite? The merest speck Of animated matter, to the eye That studiously surveys the wise design, Is a full volume of abundant art. If to the spot invisible we strain Our aching sight, and with microptic tube Bring it at last within our feeble ken, What beauty owns it not? what crowded grace? No point to Thee so delicately fine Can reason fancy, where thy curious hand May not have couch'd innumerable charms, Could we down stretch our slender faculty, Our visual ray so feculent and dull, And read the wonders microscopic eye Has taught us never, and shall never learn. Is it no pleasure, when prevailing frost Has harden'd earth's dank surface, and the foot Treads upon rock where erst it sank absorb'dâ Is it no pleasure, ere the rising sun Has drawn away the raw unwholesome fog That dwells upon the vale, to venture forth And mark the wonders of the midnight rime; To pace it briskly o'er the plain, beset With bents and rushes fear, erewhile erect And little notic'd, nodding now, superb As plumes upon the hearse, or rosy brow Of beauty deck'd for conquest in the dance? Where are the treasuries of water now? Delicate element, wherever lodg'd, How shuns thy fearful fluid the keen touch Of arrow-breathing frost, o'er ev'ry plash, And ev'ry furrow of the ploughing wheel, And ev'ry socket which the pastern left Erewhile impeded, a transparent plate, Studded with beads or crystal spikes serene, Relinquishing, and shrinking into earth! The very flood, that but a fair day since Spread wide his thin invasion, is constrain'd Within his barrier. His arrested tide In fragments hangs suspended o'er the dyke Hollow beneath, and bursting with loud crash Surprises oft both traveller and steed, Startled alike at its immediate fall. Touch'd by the genial orb, the scatter'd rime, That whiten'd ev'ry meadow, steals away; Save where the molehill intercepts the beam, Or steepy brow, or intervening hedge, Or furrow westward tending. On each blade Of the flock-nibbled field it hangs serene In brilliant dew-drops, twinkling bright as stars, Another heav'n, which the clear orb of day Not quenches but illumes, a dazzling shew Of constellations kindled as we pass; Reflecting some his introverted beam Pure as deriv'd, his hue of orange some Presenting only, sparks of amber deem'd. Again night passes, and severer frost Binds fast impeded nature. Soon as morn Kindles, the village younker tries his foot Upon the frozen margin of the pool, Fearful to venture on the slippery floor, Lest, bursting with abrupt and hideous crash, It drown his instep, and his naily shoe Drench with the chilling element below. Bold with success, he tries a daring stroke Along its verge, and now magnanimous Darts o'er the fragile center of the flood His long resounding slide. Safe borne to shore, He turns impatient, and with rushing heel Shapes o'er the pond his parallel return. Then round and round he leads his gliding team Of school-mates well-assur'd, and panting sport Glows with her effort, nor bestows a thought Upon the lurking peril of her game. Oft let me ponder on thy strong control, Thou wonder-working frost, that in a night The miry way, impassable at eve, Converts to iron, which nor foot, nor wheel, Nor tool can penetrateâcovers the lake, E'en to the kicksey vulnerable erst, With adamantine war-defying shield, Which braves the pressure of a host unhurtâ Arrests the rivuletâthe river bindsâ Lays its imperious mandate on the gulph, And fetters navigation to its shoreâ In resolute embrace the whaler locks Amid sea anchor'd, fearless of surpriseâ And launches now a continent of ice To wreck the war-ship in the midmost deep. Wild flies the mid-day vapour dense and foul, And soon shall come the fall. O'er the blue deep Of beauteous ether trails the lazy cloud, A sable fleece, repository dark Of murky snows unwinnow'd, stooping low, Lambent already of the topmost hill. Few flakes of ev'ry size float through the air, As undetermin'd or to rise or fall: Caught by the circling eddy of the breeze, Lo! now they mingle all in rapid dance, And with a sweep descend. A feathery show'r Of flakes enormous follows, 'lighting soft As cygnet's down, or egret from the head Of thistle ravish'd. Oft against the shower Homeward returns the steeple-loving daw, But, blinded still, with agitated wing Down drops, struggling in vain, and to the branch, Which midway meets him in his worried flight, Retires defeated. To his early couch, The golden lap of the vast western cloud Which spreads beneath him its capacious bed, Hastens the sun, or through the saffron skirt Of the dark cloud that overtakes his orb Snow-shedding, with dishevell'd beams aslant Disorder'd smiles. In his pale watery ray Glitters the distant vane and gilded clock. Night follows, muffled in profoundest gloom. The sullen gale howls in the dismal elm, Or in the chimney groans, with sudden gust Oft forcing downward a sulphureous puff Noisome below. Against the window pelts, Scarce heard, at intervals, the frozen show'r, And, ev'ry crevice ent'ring, piles within Drift unperceiv'd of its thrice-bolted flake. How chang'd the day-break! The bright yester sun Led forth a peerless morn, and smiling scal'd The still meridian of heav'n's ample dome, Cloudless, and lin'd with an unspotted vest Of purest blue; while laughing earth beneath Shew'd no reluctant verdure, well content, However keen the season, to expand Her vernal mantle o'er the humid field. Now breaks, in vapour wrapt, the piercing dawn. Unusual light upon the ceiling thrown Wakes from its slumber the suspicious eye, And bids it look abroad on hill, and dale, Cottage, and steeple, in the niveous stole Of Winter trimly dress'd. The silent show'r, Precipitated still, no breeze disturbs, While fine as dust it falls. Deep on the face Of the wide landscape lies the spotless flood Accumulating still, a vast expanse, Save where the frowning wood without a leaf Rears its dark branches on the distant hill, Or hedge-row, ill-discern'd, with dreary length Strides o'er the vale encumber'd, or lone church Stands vested weatherward in snowy pall, Conspicuous half, half not to be discern'd. The yester wain, that thunder'd as it pass'd, Nor made impression on the rugged plain With frozen sockets rough, now softly moves, And labours silent through the feathery drift, As if its every wheel and every hoof Were shod with noiseless felt or stiller down. How fair the deluge that enwraps the hill! Its whiteness shames the murky cloud above, Makes ocean turbid seem and doubly foul, And to the sullied aspect of the cliff Allows no neatness. What if the clear orb Of night or day from the pure vault of heaven Look unimpeded down! How glowing then The thrice-bleach'd purity of earth beneath, Wrapt like a spirit in a blaze of light! And how excels her splendor, well oppos'd By the deep azure of the heav'n above! Short is the pleasure of the transient gleam. The penetrating breeze, whose frozen gale, Midway the seldom-breathing East between And North of arrowy lungs, blows from a cave Of everlasting ice redundant cloud And the strong current of perpetual snow, Sweeps from the hoary brow of shuddering earth Her powder'd wreath, strips her broad shoulders bare, And mingles with its fine and rapid shower The flakes that settled on her breast in vain. With insult riotous aloft in air It lifts the deluge, from the summit swept, And drifts it deep along the vale below. How stings the gust, distressful to the face And ill-defended ear, while o'er the plain, Screen'd by no hedge-row, lies the bitter path! And how delights the persecuted cheek To meet the glowing shelter of high wood, Or garden wall prolix, or endless pale! Pure shines the flake we trample, crusted o'er With icy plate, where'er the feeble ray Of the short morning gleam dissolv'd awhile Its dazzling treasures. Yet sustains it not The tread of passenger alert, but, crush'd And forcibly condens'd, complains aloud Of the hard pressure of his froward foot. Incessant frost prevails. In every nook, Key-hole, and angle, howls the whiffling gust, And quaintly imitates man's whisp'ring voice, His sigh, and groan profound. Snow falls apace. On either margin of the rippling brook Appears a border of encroaching ice, Which o'er its surface creeps. Under its wings, Chastely transparent, merrily alive, Glides unarrested still the living stream. Fresh at the bottom, mindless of the storm, Smiles the green cress aquatic; till at length, Spike after spike advancing, in midstream The furrowy surface closes. Ill-discern'd And all unheard travels the brook beneath; Nor seldom, by the ceaseless drift o'erwhelm'd, Lives unperceiv'd, and the deep-plunging foot Wraps without notice in suffusion chill. Slow moves the torpid river: flakes of ice Stoop from the bank to kiss his shrinking stream, Which, lazily advancing, yet appears To reek with labour. On his surface float Isles desolate and horrid, snow-besprent, Of his own frozen waters. Change is near. Slow falls the weary flake, and yon dun cloud Briskly ascending from the cottage hearth, Pillar voluminous of lofty smoke, Foretells that soon their idle lapse shall cease. Lo! it subsides. The foul depending cloud Draws ling'ring upward its apparent skirt, And through its sever'd fleece shews ill-refin'd The welcome azure. O'er the city swells The cloud prodigious of uplifted smoke, Wrapping her distant steeples in eclipse Soon to be swept away. Yet ere the shut Of evening comes, shall the departing beam Of the low sun delight us, and the moon, Soon as he disappears, in the fair east Rise ample-orb'd upon a waste of snow. Meantime what pleasure yields the rural walk! Delights it not to pass the thresher's close, What time with instant wing from their scant meal Of winnow'd draff the sparrow swarm upspring? The mingled hurry of their sounding plumes How startles it the ear, while they alert Along the hedge-row show'r, or sit aloft, And from the summit of the leafless elm Excessive chirpings pour; fond parliament, Where all are speakers, and none sits to hear! In thick and horrent coat, no longer sleek, With heels unclipp'd, and shaggy mane promiss, In his lone corner stands the leering colt, At leisure relishing his scanty meal Of thin up-shaken forage. To the cow, That with a wishful look his feast surveys At fearful distance fix'd, from his white eye Revers'd he flashes indignation strong And peremptory menace, crouching close, And trampling loose on his vindictive heel, With sullen down-laid ear. Not far remote, Round the sweet remnant of the hoarded rick Slic'd to a core, or solitary wain In the still bottom of the shelter'd vale For their subsistence plac'd, convenes the flock, Of their approaching meal-time duly aware. Eagerly throng they, as of yore they troop'd In the dry summer's eve, with hurried bell And dust-provoking tread, to village pool, Or valley trough from the near well supplied. Subdued by hunger, the poor feathery tribes Small dread of man retain, though wounded oft, Oft slain, or scar'd by his resounding tube. The fieldfare grey, and he of ruddier wing, Hop o'er the field unheeding, easy prey To him whose heart has adamant enough To level thunder at their humbled race. The sable bird melodious from the bough No longer springs, alert and clamorous, Short flight and sudden with transparent wing Along the dyke performing, fit by fit. Shudd'ring he sits, in horrent coat outswoln. Despair has made him silent, and he falls From his lov'd hawthorn, of its berry spoil'd, A wasted skeleton, shot through and through By the near-aiming sportsman. Lovely bird, So end thy sorrows, and so ends thy song. Never again in the still summer's eve, Or early dawn of purple-vested morn, Shalt thou be heard, or solitary song Whistle contented from the watery bough, What time the sun flings o'er the dewy earth An unexpected beam, fringing with flame The cloud immense, whose shower-shedding folds Have all day dwelt upon a delug'd world. No, thy sweet pipe is mute, it sings no more. High on the topmost branches of the elm In sable conversation sits the flock Of social starlings, the withdrawing beam Enjoying, supperless, of hasty day. Half-starv'd and petrified, the pigeon mopes With bloated plumage on the dove-house tile, And seems forgetful of his amorous bow And note of love profound. No more he starts With loud applauding wing from his hush'd cove, Nor sweeps with swift career the snowy down. But most of all subdued, or fearful least Of man's society, with ruddy breast Against the window beats, sagacious bird, The robin. At the door half open left Or by the gale unlatch'd, or narrow pass Of air-admitting casement, or (to him Sufficient port) the splinter'd aperture Of attic pane demolish'd, with a flirt Enters the fledg'd intruder. He has left His haunt divine, the woodhouse and the barn, A feathery mendicant made bold by want, And ev'ry little action asks aloud, Alms the most indigent might well afford, A drop of water and a crumb of bread. Timid and sleek upon the floor he hops, His ev'ry feather clutch'd, all ear, all eye, And, springing swift at the first sound he hears, Thumps for dismission on the healthy pane. Sweet beggar, no. Impenetrable glass Has clos'd around thee its transparent cage, Escape denying. Satisfy thy need, And, having fed, be free. Beneath my chair Sit budge, a feathery bunch; upon its staves Polish thy clatt'ring beak; with head revers'd Dress ev'ry plume that decks thy plain surtout, And either pinion of thy slender wing; With bridled bill thy ruddy bosom smooth, And, all perform'd, delight me, if thou wilt, With a faint sample of contented song, Concise and sweet. Then flit around the room, Cheerful though silent, seizing with an air Each crumb diminutive which the last meal Dropt unperceiv'd, and the religious broom Unconscious left upon the woven floor, Or which the hand of charity lets fall Not grudging. Banquet here, and sleep to-night, And, when thy morning meal is finish'd, fly; Nothing unwelcome if thou dare return, And daily seek the hospitable feast, Strew'd to invite thee on the casement ledge. Soon as eve closes, the loud-hooting owl, That loves the turbulent and frosty night, Perches aloft upon the rocking elm, And hallooes to the moon. She mounting slow Steers her wild voyage through a troubled sea Of dissipated scud, apparent oft, Oft intercepted by the billowy skirt Of the fleet vapour, oft in part o'ercome, Yet still victorious, be the storm how rude, And nothing later at the port she seeks, Retarded by the tide of adverse cloud. Come, cheerful season, when the village-clerk With slips of evergreen his long aisle decks, When cottage maids alert their windows trim With the red berry and the varnish'd leaf Of holly never sear, and hang on high The tufted misletoe. It wins me much; And, childish as the sage may deem the toil, My hand shall help to decorate the pane. The peasant female now, with finger nice And curious scissar, fashions for her child The paper ornament, and crowns his brow And decorates his skirt with fair device. Proud of his honours, at the pastor's door He sings and shudders, chanting carol rude Of comfort and of joy. His labour'd song Humanity within hears with a smile, Admires the casual tremor of its tones, And the loose halfpenny with glad consent Upon the frozen quaverer bestows. Soon from the moist Antarctic breathes the gale, And its ill-molten shower of arrowy sleet, Storm fracture threat'ning of the pelted pane, Scatters aslant and sloping to the breeze. Awhile congealing on the trunk expos'd Of the lone tree, or timber stretch'd at length, Or stile unshelter'd, or storm-facing gate, Or slippery surface of uncover'd rock, An icy coat it spreads around serene, With gelid welcome the protruded hand Surprising unobserv'd, beguiling too Ofttimes the foot unwary, and with fall Disgraceful vexing the confounded man, All overwhelm'd and flound'ring in the drift. Partial and brief the shower; for now a mist Draws o'er the distant hill its dusky veil, Now hovers in the valley, now involves The total landscape, leaving to the eye Small hemisphere and dark, a little world Few yards encompassing, a cloudy coop, That with the mover moves, and coops him still. Touch'd by the trailing fog the mountain snows Dissolve, and, hast'ning to the vale below, Unite their waters, till combin'd in one They fret the midway hill and gully deep His flinty side. Insufferably foul The thicken'd torrent hurries down the vale, And, every basin fill'd that stay'd its march, Steers for the deep with still-increasing tide, Till from the precipice abrupt it pours, A foamy cataract that roars aloud, And tinctures far beneath the decent vest Of ocean fretful at its wild embrace. The snowy pall from hill and dale slow thaw At length removes, save where the tardy drift, In dissolution ling'ring, last expires. Ten thousand currents, tinctur'd by the soil From whence they issue, hurry to the main. E'en Ouse her silver purity has lost And feminine deportment. Full of shame, And wroth at her adulterated stream, She flounces seaward, and complains aloud To parent ocean of the wrong she feels. Turbid and brown into the greedy deep, Sated with feculence, the chider falls. Scarce disappears the deluge, when the mole, Close pris'ner long in subterraneous cell Frost-bound, again the miner plays, and heaves With treble industry the mellow mound Along the swarded vale. The shepherd's eye With unforgiving enmity surveys The long concatenated sweep of hills, Whose soft and crumbling soil abridges more The scanty pittance of his hungry fold. Full in the pathway of his buried foe The hollow engine of surprise he plants, Portcullis treacherous, deceitful noose, Which oft with sudden insult from his cave Th' unwary toiler plucks, and hangs aloft On dismal gibbet, swinging to the wind. Behold! where now he undersaps the sward, And lifts the recent soil. The passing cur His persevering industry detects, And stands with prick'd-up ear and lifted paw His labours watching. In the crumbled hill He plunges sudden his impatient feet, And far behind him showers the loose earth Pluck'd hastily away. With nose deep-sunk He sniffs inquisitive, but seizes not The wily engineer, in time aware. Such pleasure, such amusement Winter yields, To him who loves with nature to converse, And paint her image in immortal song. E'en from the naked February wood, Assemblage multitudinous of boughs, He plucks contentment. There the giant oak Uprears contorted its enormous arm, Despoil'd of foliage, yet not unadorn'd In the thin frippery of lichen dress'd E'en to its utmost finger. There the birch With fine-spun branch and silvery rind appears; And there, retentive of its wither'd leaf, The beech smooth-bodied, decorated oft With names uncouth carv'd on its sinewy trunk. At its foot thrives the winter-loving moss, Luxuriant most when the bare branch above Retains no verdure. During summer's heat, However shelter'd, it grew sear and died, Or seem'd to die; but, the dank hour arriv'd, Lo! how it wraps about the wreathen root Its shaggy mantle, flourishing profuse. What loom e'er furnish'd for imperial floor Tapis more rich, or grateful to the foot? What hand ere spread upon the smooth settee Cushion more gentle, plushy pile more soft? Nor only on the beech-root recent smiles, Or wall of ancient edifice or field, Or thatch decay'd that clothes the peasant's cot, But oft amid the lean and meager turf Of the low lawn, or hill, looks sprightly forth The prosp'rous moss; there to the fond eye spreads Its welcome carpet of refreshing green, And freely blossoms in the piercing gust. Bleak as it is, through day's severest gloom Appears sweet promise of the milder year. So testify the spurs ready to burst And blossom gaily on the pear-tree bough; And proves especially the forked branch Of lilac, bearing at its either point Twin buds protuberant: proves too, beneath, Not venturesome in vain, the pendulous flower, That, drooping, dares unveil its modest charms E'en to the kiss of blossom-killing frost. Pleas'd with her beauty, the tyrannic storm Not mars her elegance with surly touch, But wraps his snows around her beauteous head, And names her his for ever. Lead the year, Thou welcome harbinger of softer days, Drop, which, more lovely than the winnow'd flake Which strives to hide thy charms, in the cold ear Of Winter beauteous hang'st, and sham'st the fall Most pure that veils thee, and extends around Its candid drift in competition vain. White in the shrubbery, at every turn, Thy verdant tuft its bevy delicate Of fair tripetalous depending flowers Displays, and dances in the froward breeze. Protected snug beneath the southern fence, Lily of Lent, with diadem superb, The monarch daffodil, uprears his head, Nor dreads the guillotine of the keen gale. Green at his side, with arrow-headed leaf, Spring his attendant court, his train of peers And peeresses superb, Ladies and Lords; So name the rural folk the speckled cowls That sheath the tender arum, yet alive And yet abundant, though the sable bird Of sweetest melody the winter long Dwelt here, and still with persevering beak Harrow'd the soil, soon as the mid-day sun The chains of frost unbound; keen democrat, Making nobility his daily bread. Sweet is the foretaste of returning Spring, When, after dismal weeks of gloom and fog, Reluctant February lifts at last The cloudy turban from his sullen brow, And cheers us with a short unwilling smile. How pleasant then th' appearance here and there Of the blue zenith through the muffled heaven! How welcome the sun's clear but transient beam! Its comfortable warmth the shoulder owns, And the fond eye rejoices to survey The shadow human, once again impress'd Upon the bladeless turf. But soon departs Th' invigorating gleam, and o'er the down, Nothing retarded by intreaty, flits. It visits now the lark, and wakes his song, Now cheers the shepherd and his pregnant flock, Now climbs the mountain, and is seen no more. If haply the dense curtain all withdraw, And leave unclouded the pure vault of heaven, How pleasant to behold the glowing sun A more extended curve from rise to fall Describing daily, from his billowy couch Ascending earlier, later to his rest, And better-pleas'd retiring with a smile! How sweet a train of pleasurable days Are beckon'd hither, and how soon shall dance Each after other over down and dale! Soon shall the vanquish'd night her empire yield, And share the scepter with victorious day. Darkness shall reign inferior; heav'nly light Upon her either boundary shall steal, Shall gird her round with beams, and dart a ray Through the sad mantle of her dunnest hour. How cheerfully my heart the sweet return Of bud and bloom presages, sees ere seen The daisy-sprinkled mead, and flowery dell, And coppice-shelter'd primrose yet unblown! BOOK IV. ARGUMENT OF THE FOURTH BOOK. The pleasures of the favourite village during Springâthe warm sun, and first leaf and blossom of the yearâthe fine night and stormy day of Marchâthe equinoctial sunriseâgeneral appearance of natureâthe flockâthe ewe and lambâthe reptile basking in the sunâthe first appearance of the flesh-fly âthe pleasure of travelling at this seasonâvarious wild blossomsâthe pea and beanâthe plough-teamâthe group of weedersâthe clear mid-day sunâthe song of birds, especially the larkâthe warmer day of Spring, and its effect upon the ploughman and his teamâthe appearance of the swallow âof the butterflyâof the child pursuing itâof the caterpillar âgeneral view of natureâthe first of Mayâthe furze down âthe gardenâthe hedge-rowâbirds building nestsâthe evening walkâagreeable vernal sounds of the favourite village âthe walk at noonâThe sight of cattle grazingâof boys playing at cricketâof other rural sportsâof the mower âof the bean fieldâthe clear evening not expected, and its agreeable imageryâthe bee, an emblem of the bardâConclusion. Say, when the northern gale of March blows keen, Inducing ear-twitch, ague, pain acute Of tooth decaying, pulmonary cough, Or ach rheumatic of the shudd'ring limb, Under the southern wall, yet unadorn'd, Or hedge-row shelter of the rosy dyke, Where blooms the pale-ey'd messenger of prime, In the warm sunbeam of unclouded noon Is it not heav'n to bask? Is it not heav'n To walk beneath the high meridian wall, Where the spruce apricot, a daring beau, His leafless branches with advent'rous bloom Sparingly powders, or their blushing gems Unfold, more cautious, nectarine and peach? Lo! the flush'd almond tree, divinely fair! Why blush her ruddy blossoms, but for shame Of the bare bloomless branch that round her lives, And shews no flower, and no leaf unfolds? So redden'd erst the sacerdotal rod, And dropp'd its bloom, and deck'd its branch with fruit, While not a bud the naked stems adorn'd Of its unhallow'd rivals. Wond'rous God, Tender and good to all which thou hast made, Succour the blossom and the forward budâ The scarce and fearful daisy, ill disclos'd And couching low, veiling its tender eye With fingers dipp'd in crimsonâthe fresh leaf That decks the gooseberry's vindictive branch, And elder's thornless boughâthe ruddy ear Of woodbine eager to be gay, his flow'r Determin'd soon about the ling'ring oak To wind in shame of the slow Spring's delay. Succour the lilac, whose prolific bud Betrays its purple symptom, promise sweet Of many a spike to be unfolded soon, And nod majestic on the brow of May. Thou fickle season, let thy morning smile To noon continue, and from noon to night. Let not the cloud that lifts its pillowy head Above the blue horizon, and ere long Shall shew its sable waist and trailing skirt, Curtain thy orb, and the protruded gem Bruise with its dancing hailstone. If the show'r Fall frequent, fall it kind, and not severe, And fall to meliorate the thirsty soil Of field and garden, that thy genial beam May hatch the blade of ev'ry seed unseen. So shall the farmer bless theeâso, his dame, Who spreads to bleach upon the village green Her home-spun sheeting, recent from the loomâ So, the blithe gard'ner, often with his spade Seen early deep-upturning the rich soil, Harrowing often and disposing smooth Its mellow surface with the fine-tooth'd rake, Often his scythe heard whetting ere the dawn, And shaving smooth the sward, or seen at noon Trampling his border with assiduous heel. If show'r, attended by the gale, descend, Grateful the contrast of imperious day Chasing indignant the dishevell'd cloud, And still transparent night, with peerless gems Studding the tranquil canopy of heaven. From yon uplifted summit, when the sun Of March, high-mounted, wears a moody smile, Indulgent only to these winnow'd brows, What time the partial storm in sullen pomp Sails o'er the prostrate weald, let me look down And see the murky cloud prone deluge shed, And ev'ry town and steeple, dim-discern'd, Curtain in gloom terrific. At such time, What if the lightning bolt, long laid aside, Amid the grim procession chance to gleam, And thunder, surly to be rous'd so soon, Mutter reluctant from his stormy couch? It shall but solemn render the slow march Of the dark tempest, through its gloomy brows Frowning meridian night, and wake no dread, No wish of flight, nor sense of peril here. No! I shall eye it safely as it steals In gloomy state away, and leaves behind The freshen'd landscape leisurely dismiss'd. Lo! in the glowing east the cloud sublime Lifting its arduous and illumin'd head High above highest earth, a pile superb Of vapour, wrapping in its smoky skirts Heav'n's everduring threshold, and the beam Of day's clear orb resplendent from its folds Reflecting glorious. With the falling sun Slow sinks the pomp away, and while his orb In flaky redness sets, and fills the west With fiery fragments of disparted cloud, The last-apparent summit of the storm The ruddy hue imbibes, and sanguine glows; Till, day withdrawn and the vex'd ether hush'd, The tempest all subsides and dies away, And the pure heav'n displays an ardent moon Swimming self-balanc'd through the blue profound. On this commanding summit let me stand, To see the vernal equinoctial orb Fresh from his chambers in the deep ascend. Arise, bright leader of the beauteous year, Sweep thy long fingers o'er the shadowy vale, And smite the hill-tops. Nature at thy soft Reviving touch with concord exquisite Shall to her center vibrate. Total earth Shall ring sweet unison from hill and dale. My bosom, like the fabled lyre of old Memnonian, or the harp that wooes the breeze, Shall sing with ecstasy, and pour around Spontaneous sweet effusion, mellow verse, Ode best expressive of the grateful soul. Here let me stand, and o'er the level weald, That, like a spacious chart, outstretch'd beneath Lies chequer'd, cast an aching eye, to mark Each well-known object in the misty skirt Of the long-drawn perspective. Seen from hence The budding wood a russet hue assumes, And, as the gem protrudes, the social group Of elms and oaks that herd upon the lawn (Shelter affording to the yeaning flock) Seem pencil'd softer on the vale below. The paintress Nature with reviving green Colours her tender landscape, down and mead, A deeper tinge upon the long-sown field Spreading with equal hand, intending soon Like grace and beauty for the tardier spot. Now yields the flock to the bard's curious eye Peculiar pleasures. Often let me mark The sullen ewe's authoritative stamp Where'er the sheep-dog passes. Let me smile At her deluded sense, what time her lamb, By the bleak season slain, his welted coat Yields to the flayer, and the ravish'd twin Of some fond mother in the coarse disguise Appears loose-coated, and usurps his dug. Dull fool, how ill perceives thy stupid eye The palpable imposture! Let me hear The morning uproar of the fleecy folk, What time, vociferous, their tardy march With baying curs impatient their rude lord To the green pasture urges. Loud enquires The bleating mother for her sunder'd lamb, As loud complaining for his mother lost. With quick infallible perception, she, Amid the mingled outcry, hears distinct His slender shrill entreaty. He remote, With nicety that shames our grosser sense, Her voice acknowledges, and through the crowd Winds his insulted way. She, provident, Her milky treasures for his lip reserves, Butting intruders with a frown away. At length he finds her, and with bended knees, Emblem of innocence and filial grace, His plenteous meal receives, and bleats no more Now as I walk and slumber by the dyke, Whene'er the mid-day sun with pow'rful beam Plays full upon the bank, 'mid the fresh tops Of nettle fast reviving, or green shoots Of parsley welcome at the warren side, Or sear grass unconsum'd, or prickly goss, Wriggles the viper and the basking eft, Or spotted snake innocuous, snapping short The thread of meditation, as they glide, With whisper not unwelcome. At the door Enters the flesh-fly, and with cheerful hum Travels the house interior. On the pane Thumps he and buzzes, the resounding hall Travels again, and with a bounce departs; Grateful remembrance leaving on the mind Of still enjoyment in the musing hour Of summer's drowsy noon, and pleasing thought Oft interrupted by his brisk career. If now I journey, often at my side Let me the blue-bell'd hyacinth behold, The silver anemÃ³ne of the wood, And golden primrose, intermingled well. Let ev'ry bank with rosy tufts be fring'd; Be ev'ry corn-field carpeted anew In recent herbage, ev'ry hillock crown'd, And ev'ry valley gracefully besprent With drooping cowslip, ev'ry marshy dell With sumptuous caltha lin'd, and ev'ry down Sow'd with innumerable daisy, white Or ting'd with crimson at each finger's tip. Let delicate archangel, white as snow, In ev'ry nook appear, tempting the hand Of city botanist, or village boy Who plucks the leaf and blossom from its stem, Fearless of smart, and the quadrangled tube Into a pipe monotonous converts; A wailing pipe, whose miserable note Resembles most the viol's woeful scream By the hard hand of inexperience scrap'd, Or hautboy's harsher squall, that racks the sense, And tortures patience till she scarce endures. Not such that awfuller Archangel trump Which sang at Sinai's mount, and shook the host Of prostrate Israel with excessive awe: Nor such that future tube, which death dethron'd Shall hear ill-pleas'd, and harass man no more, Pris'ner for ever in the seal'd abyss. Neat lies the surface of the weedless field, Where springs the bean-top martially dispos'd File within file, a lusty brotherhood, Or shoots more tender in continuous rank The pea-plant ill-supported, soon to fall And with weak elbow lean upon the ground, Save where the gard'ner with indulgent hand Plants in her neighbourhood the leafless stake: There with glad tendril to the branchy staff She clings, and with ambitious finger climbs To wave her limber blossoms high in air. Now moves again, but with a sluggard's pace, Not well awake, the plough. The harness'd team Moves slowly forward, and not seldom stays, Impeded sore by congregated clods. The rooky tribe attend, and, perch'd at hand, Watch the moist furrow with superior eye, And brisk alight, upon the worm to prey, Or sweeter grub unhous'd. Frequently there Loiters, a grey-coat pensioner, the mew, (His treasury the main left far behind,) And shares the spoil terrene, with outstretch'd wing The ploughman's clodded heel pursuing close, And settling timorous. At length arrives The hour of rest long look'd for, and the team Of wearied steers, from the bright share releas'd, Leave in the midst of the fresh field upturn'd The plough recumbent, and with hurried pace March cheerful homeward. Expedition clanks The heavy chain which knits them pair to pair, And oft the forward ox, impatient, drags The lingerer behind, his brawny neck Straining with pressure of the cumbrous yoke. Forth goes the weeding dame, her daily task To travel the green wheat-field, ancle-deep In the fresh blade of harvest yet remote. Now with exerted implement she checks The growth of noisome weeds, to toil averse, An animal gregarious, fond of talk. Lo! where the gossipping banditti stand Amid field idle all, and all alike With shrill voice prating, fluent as the pye. Far off let me the noisy group behold, Nothing molested by their loud harangue, And think it well to see the fertile field By their red tunics peopled, and the frock Of the white husbandman that ploughs hard by, Or guides the harrow team, or flings the grain At ev'ry footstep with exerted arm Over the yawning furrow. Never more Pleases the rural landscape, than when man, Drawn by the vernal sunbeam from his cell, The needful culture of the field renews. Still of the frozen drift it somewhere swept Savours the breeze of morn, and makes the cheek Of beauty kindle with its keen salute. But grateful is the mild and genial noon, Which, bursting unexpected from the cloud, Dispels the sullen vapour that obscur'd And quench'd the matin beam, and the sharp gale, Which tasted of the ling'ring snows it pass'd In some cold arctic realm remote, bids hush. How delicate the foretaste yielded then Of Summer yet withheld! and how delights The ravish'd ear to listen to the sound Of warblers numberless! Appears it not As if harmonious exhalation sprung, Soon as the cheering sunbeam smote the field, From earth's transported bosom, and diffus'd Its sweet vibrations through the trembling air? No longer now assembles as of late, Gregarious only in the winter hour, Bird of the sky baptiz'd, the speckled lark. Oft o'er the plain inert or fallow then In flight circuitous the nimble flock Swam eddying, or with sudden wheel revers'd Shew'd their transparent pinions to the sun. Now, earnest as of yore with dewy plumes To touch the roof of heav'n, in the first beam Of the clear orb apparent, with a spring Mounts the sweet warbler, and with upward flight, And throat that struggles to make sweeter still Exquisite anthem, to the clouds ascends. The eye that sees him with strain'd vision soars To mark him quiv'ring in the skies above; Nor seldom, his ascension not observ'd, Looks with vain scrutiny the dappled air, Nor finds, invisible, the vocal spirit Which fills with ravishment the deep of heaven, And chants aerial melody unseen. Be still, thou chilly breeze, and let the beam Of noon refulgent o'er the mellow field Shed summer premature. Let the slow team Of steers reluctant pressing on the yoke, With down-sunk forehead and depending tongue, With winding shoulders and slow-pacing foot, Pant as it ploughs along the mountain side The furrow, turning and returning still. Let him that steers the glitt'ring share be warm, And often pause at the transparent pool, His doff'd brim dipping, and the gelid lymph, Which trickles round it to his thirsty lip, Imbibing eagerly. Let him that stalks, And from the seedlip scatters wide around The fruitful grain, peel'd of his frock appear, White o'er the furrows marching. White as he Follow the pilot of the harrow-team, Crumbling the surface, and concealing well Under its levell'd wave the buried seed. Alike divested, o'er the finish'd field, With sleeve expos'd and long resounding whip, Let the rude boy, of his employment proud, Guide the revolving axis. Gentle Heaven, Yield meet indulgence to the yeaning flock Which spreads the green enclosure, and the lamb Cherish propitious, whether he repose, Or feebly totter upon feet untried, Or gambol sprightly round the grazing ewes, Soon lost, and soon enquiring for his dam, Who bleats and mumbles at his slender call. Yield to the trembling calf, inactive yet, And the faint mother lowing at his side Internal fond concern, their due support. How welcome to the sight, when first discern'd The vernal swallow, skimming with swift wing The windy mead, or floating high in air If noon be calm, or twitt'ring lonely song Perch'd on the brink of chimney-throat profound! How sweetly falls it on th' attentive ear, Reviving memory of summers past, And many a sweet and pleasurable thought Of sultry days enjoy'd and mus'd away Beneath the garden shade, while thus she sang And warbled freely from her household nest! Behold again with saffron wing superb The giddy butterfly. Releas'd at length From his warm winter cell, he mounts on high, No longer reptile, but endued with plumes, And through the blue air wanders; pert alights, And seems to sleep, but from the treach'rous hand Snatches his beauties suddenly away, And zig-zag dances o'er the flow'ry dell. Across the lawn he flies. His sumptuous wing Provokes attention in the playful child, Who gallops brisk his not unruly cane Over the daisies at his parent's door, Diverting and diverted. With fix'd eye The settled bird he marks, with eager hand Grasps at the prize, but covets it in vain, Gives chace impetuous, but unable soon To reach the golden flutterer, aloft Flying still free, with final fond attempt Tosses his cap in air, and strives no more. So hunts the fast philosopher his fly, The gilded fugitive o'er hedge and dyke Insane pursuing with a child's career. 'Twere well if he too fail'd, and spread his net And toss'd his cap in vain, and seldom doom'd The beauteous captive to a ling'ring death. But oft with base delight his murd'rous hand Impales the sufferer, and heats the dart Which pierc'd its mail with ineffectual wound, By little and by little quenching life, Lest the quick hand of mercy discompose And mar the beauty of its burnish'd coat. Lively abhorrence stigmatize the deed. It is enough for poets to detain The lovely stranger, till the curious eye Has well survey'd its graces, and ador'd The power that cloth'd it in attire so gay. Such inquisition made, to the free wing Give we the pris'ner, liberty restore, Dismiss and thank him, and enjoy the thought That some remote similitude is our's Of Him who all things made, and all preserves, Sparing the meanest, and oppressing none. Hatch'd by the sunbeam from contiguous cells Around the slender apple-twig combin'd In circuit orderly, egg glued to egg, Issue the caterpillar swarm minute. There left, oviparous, her half-born brood, Ere summer clos'd, the parent; left, and died. There have they still endur'd, and still surviv'd Sharp winter's tyranny; the bitter frost, That slew the myrtle and the lasting leaf Of the screen'd laurel chang'd, no death to them. Now busily conven'd, upon the bud That crowns their genial branch they feast sublime, And spread their muslin canopy around, Pavilion'd richer than the proudest king. The spinster caterpillar ties aloft, Fine as the gossamer, his slender cord To his lov'd cradle the recov'ring elm, And, playfully suspended, rocks and whirls, And, ere his wings are granted, lives in air. So dangles o'er the brook, depending low, The spider artist, till propitious breeze Buoy him athwart the stream. From shore to shore He fastens then his horizontal thread, Sufficient bridge, and, traversing alert, His fine-spun radii flings from side to side, Shapes his concentric circles without art, And, all accomplish'd, couches in the midst, Himself the center of his flimsy toils, So spins the British mariner his shrouds, Nor spins them with less art, what time he fits To the vast thunder-bark her woven wings. Now let the painter poet walk abroad. At ev'ry turn shall his attentive eye Some lovely feature of reviving prime Observe delighted. The green springing blade Of wheat, impatient of the long control Of ling'ring frost, spite of the prancing lamb And mumbling ewe that check its prosp'rous growth, Waves upon ev'ry hill. From ev'ry vale, With verdure scarce inferior, smiles remote The herb reserv'd, and not to be impair'd By the voracious grazer's hungry tooth, Ere it has yielded to the herdsman's scythe The precious burden of the fragrant rick. The orchard floor, with sumptuous carpet spread, Shames the flow branch that only buds above. The hedge-row feels the scandal of delay, And, here and there, along the sunny dyke, The pendent catkin hangs and flowery gull. Provok'd at their reproach, the darker thorn Awakes, and sprinkles his vindictive branch, Not to be touch'd in vain, with bloom of snow. Their tender leaf the woodbine and the quick Put softly forth. The cerasus sublime Decks with few blossoms cautiously display'd The cottage garden-plot, while bold beneath The gooseberry unfolds an ample leaf, And hides in foliage her ten thousand swords. Sweet holiday of nature, eldest born Of the fair train of laughter-loving May, Come with thy garland tripping debonair, Dance to the music of the woodland choir, And lead thy lovely sisterhood along In flowery fantastic chace. Bear each, Lightly depending from her careless arm, The mingled basket of ten thousand hues, Blossoms of ev'ry odour, and with hand Profusely bounteous strew them in the vale, Or crown the mountain with their fragrant wreath. Come not, as once I met thee, wrapt in clouds Down-stooping awful, and with no vain threat Charg'd, when thy furious sulphur-breathing steeds, By lightning lash'd, gallop'd with thund'ring hoofs The hollow amphitheatre of heav'n, Till ether roar'd above, and earth beneath Quak'd at the hurry of thy sultry wheels. Yet come not showerless, but let thy brief And transitory cloud oft intercept The glowing day-beam, and with silken sound Dispense its gentle fertilizing dews Upon the thankful champain. Thus refresh'd, Earth shall the bridal suit of youth put on, And hill and valley, in the various hues Of mingled verdure dress'd, seem to the sight A lovely paradise, where all is fresh, All fair and flourishing, and nothing fear. How elegant yon furze-hill cloth'd in gold! Though distant, the soft undulating breeze, That sweeps its flow'rs and after laves the cheek, Bears to the nostril of its faint perfume Sufficient to subdue and drowse the sense, Nor make it wish for more. Behold at hand Presage delightful of the beauteous year; The bud, no longer cautious, from the bough Drops its small winter tunic, and bestrews With flaky show'r the gravell'd path beneath. Now sends the garden all its glories forth, With many a nodding pyramid of flowers, Or pale or purple-hued, her varnish'd leaf The lilac decks. Laburnum at her side Weeps gold, sweet mourner! From behind uprears, And tosses high in air her frothy globes, Her unsubstantial roses, light as foam Of new milk bubbling in the cow-herd's pail, The beauteous guelder shrub. Along the wall Displays the fruit-tree its superbest bloom. The glorious shew fond appetite surveys, And dreams of special apricots unborn, Of the fine-flavour'd nect'rine, juicy gage, Cherry delicious, plum with purple coat, Sweet pear and mellow apple, luscious fig, And the well-relish'd orb of autumn peach, Which almost melts or e'er it reach the lip. Where'er the cherry spreads its flowery tufts, 'Tis pleasure to survey the snowy pomp, And pause in contemplation of the hum Of mingled bees industrious, that invade And rifle in succession ev'ry flower; Some large, and gifted with the voice profound Of mellow bass, some with the loftier pipe Of tenor soft, of small soprano some, That fancy oft may deem she hears distinct The sweet coincidence of fellow tones Producing harmony's full chord divine. Where the meek sycamore, of nothing vain, Covers with foliage its depending flowers, The same harmonious murmur shall be heard; Which feeds delay and gratifies repose Beneath his singing bough, from earliest morn To sultry noon, from noon to latest eve. What wonder that the hind his evening tube Of sweet Virginian fragrance at his door Delights to kindle, if thy drowsy branch His bench o'ershadow? Luxury it is Here to be stationary, or where'er Around the honied foliage of the lime The bee by day and chafer hums at eve, Roaring profound and buzzing as it 'lights To sup upon the dewy fragrant leaf. O lovely season! when on ev'ry bough The recent equipage of beauty glows Divine, and even in the bush appears The manifested God. How sweet to sense, How delicate the breeze that lades its wings With odours from the hawthorn! To the spot Where dwells the sweet allurer, decking late Her crowded foliage with abundant flow'rs, Turns the fond eye to gaze, and, smit with love, Marks here the swelling bough's expanded bloom, And there a host of beauties yet unborn, Globules unnumber'd the prolific branch Besetting thick around, ere long to unfold Their milky petals to th' enamour'd bee. Hard by, another peerless beauty blooms. Behold the blushing crab, and view elate Her sanguine blossoms intermingled well With crimson buds unblown, and her red arm, To the less rubicund espalier's branch Or maiden's orchard's bough of snow, prefer. Such is the rural apple; emblem fair Of nature's sweet uneducated maid, Whose glowing cheek, by city air unbleach'd, The bloom of health and loveliness retains. No lily fairer in attire, no rose More delicately blushing, lo! she comes, From the religious altar just dismiss'd With finger conscious of the ring it wears, A bride consorted. Native modesty Down-weighs her drooping eyelid to the ground, And rich confusion glows upon her cheek. The village spinsters shower on her head And strew before her the full lap of flowers, Not without caution cull'd, lest aught unfair, Offensive aught, or aught of jealous hue, Or unprolific, ill express the hope Of joy and peace and fertile days to come. Say now, which most excels, the sanguine flower Of the wild apple that adorns its bough, Or glowing rose of her disorder'd cheek? And say, on which would thy transported heart Bestow in preference the smile or kiss? Now ev'ry feather'd tenant of the grove Labours his sweetest song, studious to cheer His busy mate, a pensive architect, That builds the woven wonder of the nest, Laps in a gentle cradle lin'd with down Her future brood, or vigilant expects Day after day the pregnant egg to live, And supplicate provision, not in vain. Such care maternal needs the sweet relief Of labour'd song, and sometimes, parent Sir, The free assistance of a silent beak. Enamour'd songsters, grateful is the task, While you from ev'ry brake the rising orb With sweet hosanna welcome, to admire And mark the several energies, that fill Your morning anthem of spontaneous praise. The sparrow couple with industrious bill The scatter'd straw collect, contriving snug Under the cottage eave or low-roof'd barn Their genial couch. More than mere chirpers now, They watch the floating feather as it flies, Eye-serve the goose for his superfluous down, Or dressing fowl, or self-adorning drake, And bear triumphant the loose spoil away. Nor these alone are busy. Feathery pairs, Innumerable as the kindling bud, Of wedded cares partake, and build the nest, And hopes divide, with constancy that shames Man's brittle contract and infirm regard. Lo! to the steeple with alternate wing Bears expeditious his long twig the daw, Nor seldom struggles with his awkward freight, And drops it, startled by the hooting boy That shouts beneath. The solitary dove, Which loves the still dilapidated tower Of desert castle, or the time-cleft arch Of ancient chantry, whose unshelter'd shafts Ivy in pity clothes, and verdant moss Crowns in respect his weather-beaten head, With frequent wing alighting in the field Bears the loose stubble thence, and builds on high Her bed unseen, beyond the pilferer's reach. His airy nurs'ry in the neighb'ring elm Constructs the social rook, and makes the grove That girds the crumbling edifice around, And ev'ry angle of its ruin'd pile, With the bass note of his harsh love resound. Tell me, philosopher, in what sage school Of perfect wisdom were the feathery folk Taught to diversify and labour each The several nest of his peculiar race? Where learn'd the sloven sparrow, little wise Or little studious to excel, his art Inferior, the maternal cell to thatch? Whence drew the marten his superior skill To knead and temper, mason-like, the slime Of street or stagnant pool, and build aloft Beneath the cornice brink or shady porch His snug depending couch, on nothing hung, Founded in air, and finish'd with a neat Convenient aperture, from whence he bolts Sudden, and whither brisk returns, with mouth Fill'd for his hiant offspring? Whence receiv'd The daw his lesson, or the rook, the one Within the lonely unfrequented tower Weaving his basket of unnumber'd twigs, The other on the topmost elm sublime His wicker cradle fixing, to be rock'd By the rude nurse adversity's strong gale? Whence knew the sprightly golden-pinion'd finch, Of ruddy countenance, and ivory beak, And coat of sleekest umber, his fond art To line with locks and pave with neatest love The verdant nest of interwoven moss, Fast to the blushing apple's forked branch Amid the blossoms of the codlin tied? Thou prying school-boy, spare the neat design, And think of Him whose all-protecting hand Secretes the nestling with innumerous leaves, And with abundant foliage makes obscure, And to the sight impervious, branches erst Easily pierc'd, or by the solar ray, Or beam of human eye, or arrowy gale, Dark and impenetrable now to all. Think of His mercy that protects the nest; And, kind to all, with more especial love The linnet spare and finch of crimson face, That twitter each the none-offending song Of quiet prettiness, and pluck the down Of the prolific thistle for their bread. Not to destroy be earnest, but to save. Gentle thy heart, till it observe ill-pleas'd Yon feathery spoils of the sweet songster slain, And in the warm and sunny nook devour'd By the swift falcon. Let thy curse reprove The tyrant soaring in the clouds above (An emblem apt of thy severer self) With gyrous scrutiny the furze-clad hill Closely surveying as he winds along, Or in mid ether hovering, till his eye Some fascinated warbler fix below, And he to seize him from his airy watch Drop sudden, and not always drop in vain. What time the sun has from the west withdrawn The various hues that grac'd his cloudy fallâ When the recumbent ruminating fold Greets with peculiar odour the fond sense Of the lone wand'rerâwhen the recent leaf Of clover 'gins to sleep, and, white with dew, Closes its tender triple-finger'd palm Till morning dawn afreshâwhen the moon wears Nor hood nor veil, nor looks with cold regard Through the fine lawn of intervening cloud, But lifts a fair round visage o'er the vale, And smiles affection which no bard can paint, No painter with poetic pencil singâ When the dark cloud that couches in the west Seems to imbibe the last pale beam of eve, Absorbing in its dun and gloomy folds The feeble residue of dying dayâ Is it not pleasure, with unbended mind To muse within or meditate abroad, While either hand in the warm bosom sleeps, And either foot falls feebly on the floor, Or shaven sward, or stone that paves the path Of village footway winding to the church? 'Twere passing pleasure, if to man alone That hour were grateful: but with like desire The dusky holiday of thick'ning night Enjoys the chuckling partridge, the still mouse, The rabbit foraging, the feeding hare, The nightingale that warbles from the thorn, And twilight-loving solitary owl, That skims the meadow, hovers, drops, her prey Seizes, and screeching to her tower returns. Her woolly little ones there hiss on high, And there who will may seek them, but who dares Must 'bide the keen magnanimous rebuff Of irritated love, and quick descend, By the maternal talon not in vain Insulted, baffled, scar'd, and put to flight. 'Tis pleasant in this peaceful serious hour To tread the silent sward that wraps the dead, Once our companions in the cheerful walks Of acceptable life, the same ere long In the dark chambers of profound repose. All have their kindred here, and I have mine. Yes, my sweet Isabel, and I have mine. To dieâwhat is it but to sleep and sleep, Nor feel the weariness of dark delay Through the long night of time, and nothing know Of intervening centuries elaps'd, When thy sweet morn, Eternity, begins? Or elseâwhat is it but a welcome change From worse to better, from a world of pain To one where flesh at least can nothing feel, And pain and pleasure have no equal sway? What is it but to meet ten thousand friends, Whose earthly race was finish'd ere our own, And be well welcome, where the timorous foot Fear'd to intrude, and whence no foot returns? To me what were it but the happier lot To find my long-lost Isabel, and shed (If tears of joy are shed where tears of grief Fall never, and immortal angels weep At bliss excessive) joy's profusest show'r: To tell her what was felt, and what was sung, When cruel death unsparing from my sight Pluck'd her away, and wafted her pure spirit Whither no soul could tell?âBut hush! my heart, Lest sorrow burst her cicatrice anew, And painful thought, which saddens my slow step, Disperse the pleasures of this tranquil hour. Place of my birth, how many are the sounds, Which, peaceful as thou art, thy vernal morn, Ere yet I rise, improve! Loud lows the calf, Loud bleats the lamb, and the responsive cock His kind attentions with transition quick Duly performsâhis open-throated squall, That bids his wives and little-ones beware, Oft as the falcon or the dove appearsâ His chuckle of affection to his damesâ The shuffle of his wing, on this side now, Now exercis'd on that, with low-bow'd head, And eye attentive to the fair he courtsâ His croak of sage composureâhis brisk call, That summons to the huswife's scatter'd grainâ His sympathizing clamour o'er the nestâ His loud what what of wonderâand his shrill Far-sounding challenge to his distant peer. His feather'd concubine, meantime, aloud Prates as she passes, or with silly pride Cackles incontinent of new-laid eggs. The sea-mew cries aloft with mingled tone; And, plausible and silver-tongued, below The drake his chattering seraglio leads At the near pool to bathe. Anon is heard The turkey gabbling at the whistler boy With hollow throat profound, as 'mid his dames He struts with swelling plumes, erected fan, Low-curtsied wing, and countenance inflam'd. The croaking raven his profounder note, Seated aloft upon the bending elm, Harshly pronounces, or his sable mate Hails as she soars on high with tenor soft, Expressing well esteem and manly love. How pleasant is it, as the break of day Dawns, and the mountains lift their glowing heads Into the golden sun-beam, to be rous'd By the faint tinkling of the farmer's team, His bells of ev'ry tone, a mingled peal Remote and indistinct! Swell'd by approach They jingle loud, and louder as they pass, Then softly sing again, and die away. The voluntary toils of morning past, How pleasant to allow the studious mind Convenient pause, and, ev'ry thought dismiss'd, To ramble heedless o'er the bleating down, 'Mid thousand thousand children of the flock Yet from the dam unwean'd, and flowery tufts Ten thousand of rich furze, erewhile By the fast fleecy nibbler neatly trimm'd, And decorated now in robe superb, Wrapping its branches in a blaze of gold, As if the Deity himself were there. Be this my Horeb, often as mine eye, Fatigued with poring o'er the page divine, Thirsts for the sweet amusements of the hill; Thirsts to survey the clear unbillowy deep, Which lifts the distant vessel into heaven, And the green vale, that, various in its hues, E'en to the pebbly verge of the blue flood Its cattle-sprent enclosures neatly spreads. How delicate to bask upon the brink Of yon high cliff, which overlooks the broad And boundless ocean, at what time becalm'd The war-ship near at hand with flaccid sail Upon the polish'd bosom of the flood Lies motionless! How pleasant, while the sun Upon the foster'd shoulder tepid plays, Inducing lassitude and faint repose, To plant the telescope, and view distinct, Submitted to the clear and curious eye, The thunder-laden monster! Passing thence, How sweet to cull from the meridian bank, Which underlies the wood-invested hill, The recent, vigorous, protected flower Of cowslip, harebell, violet, or rose Of prime peculiar, and with full-fill'd hand To steal upon the nightingale unseen, Where'er she sings, invisible as wont, And marvel at the wonder-working God, Who in the compass of her slender breast Such sweet exuberance of music lodg'd; Such melody of loveliest plaintive power, Whatever mood she choose, whether to weep In feeble tone acute, or trill profound Song self-consoling, or jug sweet content, Or by ten thousand varied notes express Liquid complacency and melting love! No longer now stand dozing in the close, Or ruminate recumbent, the sad herd, But scatter'd wide upon the pastur'd hill, Meadow, and marsh, people the rural scene, And add new beauty wheresoe'er they graze. Among them skips and races the wild calf, And colt ingenuous, daring gentle touch, And nothing conscious of his future toils. No grazer he, nor useful servant yet, To help the team along, or bear his lord, But time finds much to play, to frisk, to bound, And gallop o'er the field, or idly bask Stretch'd at his ease in the meridian beam. How pleasant now upon the village stile To rest well-wearied, while the jovial boy, From school dismiss'd, upon the sunny green Pitches his wicket, a stone-steadied hat, And bowls exulting! Of encumbrance stript, He for his maiden visage nothing fears, But to the scorching day-beam, unconcern'd, His cheek and bosom bares, nor aught regards The freckled aspect, or the sun-burnt skin. Piece of the nether millstone is his heart Who marks ill-pleas'd the frolic of the child, Or views the rural festival unmov'd. Me it delights to overhear the dance Upon the winnow'd floor of the void grange, To pause at hand, and listen to the sound Of the brisk viol challenging the foot, And of the foot respondent, and to see The village maid and village hind alert Pacing the giddy labyrinth of joy, Each in the trim of holiday attir'd. Nor pleases not, upon the social green, The game laborious of the manly ball Aim'd at the wicket, and its taper shanks Levelling certain, but for hindrance quick And resolute repulse of the strong blow, That sends it thunder-struck aloft in air, Or o'er the plain rebounding. Thou hast charms, Rural festivity, not soon surpass'd, Compare thee, as we may, with sport polite, The neat amusement fashion qualifies, Till nice refinement sits without disdain Spectatress of the scene. Never more keen Their liveliest ecstasy, than when, for health To George restor'd, illumination's lamp Was freely kindled, and the rural throng From ev'ry door conven'd, along the street Mingled in loyalty's triumphant maze. Then pipe and viol felt alone fatigue, While, nothing wearied, they with foot alert The blazing window's artificial day Down danc'd, the fretted cupola of heaven Their spacious ball-room, their assembler God. 'Tis sport itself to see the cheerful lamb Skip in the field, and lead the wanton race In the soft sunshine of departing day. 'Tis pleasure to survey the couching flock, When ev'ry mother ruminates apart, Recumbent in the dusk, and ev'ry son, Sportful no longer, and his bleating hush'd, Reclines expectant of the dewy night Fast by his chewing dam. And pleasure 'tis To see the gracious moon prevail aloft, While the nocturnal curlew greets the ear With sweet contented pipe, foreboding calm. What transport is it, when awaking day Its rosy eyelid lifts, to hear the sound Of mower whetting his neglected scythe, To hear his wide and double-handed sweep Shear the reluctant herbage from the field, Disposing well in swath succeeding swath The fragrant burden, which his dewy blade Severs with ease and repetition keen From the luxuriant mead! How neat appears, Shorn of its beard promiss, the tender sward! How sweet the bean-field now, in blossoms cloth'd, With, here and there, a well-supported stem Of pea that overtops the scene, and waves The healthy banner of its crimson flower High in the liberal air; with royal ease, And condescension graceful, to the gale Still bowing. The spent orchard's bough its bloom Retains no longer. Ravish'd by the breeze, Its drifted petal mounts and floats on high, Or on the musing poet softly sheds The grateful show'r of spring's peculiar snow; As, thoughtful, he surveys and strives to paint Earth green beneath, and ether blue above, And the progressive cloud that creeps between, Trailing its fleece, to niveous fairness bleach'd, 'Cross the cerulean temple, the clear dome Of heaven sublime; where sits enthron'd on high The worshipp'd Godhead, while all nations meet And thinly people the vast aisle below. How sweet the pleasure when the muffled orb Unseen has journey'd all the livelong day, And only here and there by chance display'd A sloping sidelong beam, to see it sink Into a clear horizonâto observe The cloud-skirt far inflam'd, till its bright disc, At length apparent, swells into a drop Of purest bullion, cooling ere it falls! Lo! now, a globe complete, the crimson ball, Shorn of its lustre, of the shadowy earth Takes its last farewel. The marsh-loving gnat Swarms in its mellow mitigated ray Along the stagnant dyke, or bank of Ouse Slow moving seaward, or more speedy brook, Or dances o'er the maid who singing fills Her brimmer pail from the cud-chewing cow, Or o'er the musing loiterer aloft Hums insignificant. Now with slow step Long let me ramble in the fragrant shade Of the dark winding lane, whose powder'd thorn On either hand the hollow shadow'd way Borders impenetrable, save where gate, Rude stile, or ill-heal'd gap, a transient glimpse Yield of sweet landscape, village church and farm, Or cottage snug beneath o'erhanging elms, Or distant hill, or wood, or watery vale. Or by the wood-side patient let me stand While the mild orb of tranquil eve departs, What time the moon, ascending as he sinks, With aspect swoln and sickly scarce appears In the dun-belted east, to hear the song Of sylvan choristers, hosanna sweet, Sweet hallelujah, to the King of kings With free voice chanting. Above all delights The wood-lark echoing, the nightingale Gracing with plaintive pause her various strain, The wild dove cooing diapason soft, Language of love with elegance express'd, And ouzle fluting with melodious pipe. Deem not they praise the Deity amiss. Pleas'd he their evening sacrifice accepts, Thanksgiving pure, nor scorns it that it flows From hearts which know him not. Lo! as they sing, With grace and beauty kindles the pale cheek Of his wan minister the orb of night; The smile of pleasure glows upon her brow; She thanks them. Down the village path, releas'd And pleas'd, I saunter homeward, and the hind From distant toil returning pass rever'd; Or cross the fresh green field to see the herd Or weary team, dismiss'd, with eager mouths Crop the young herbage; or attend the sound Of village children playful, and the tone Of pipe or viol, clumsily produc'd By the rude finger of the self-taught clown. To-morrow, with the bee of humble fame, I rise to sing and trace the field anew. He, ever busy, still from flow'r to flow'r, Stooping their limber stems, the livelong day Travels with audible melodious hum. Though in ten thousand cells of varied shape Her precious balm ingenious nature hides, He knows them all, and readily unlocks The labiate blossom's close elastic lip, To steal the dear ambrosia from within. But why, sweet traveller, whose eager lip Delights to visit the bloom-sprinkled branch, And leave a kiss upon its ev'ry flower, Why scorns it to salute the beauteous rose, And greets his sweet bud never? Partial bird, Has May alone thy love? and spreads in vain June the sweet treasures of her flowery lap? Why else untouch'd upon its thorny stem Hangs the pale rose unfolding and the red? These I contemn not, every bud that blows Visiting daily with a bee's desire, And serenading with impartial praise. Musical wanderer, where'er thou stray'st, How well does thy free toil resemble mine! From flow'r to flow'r with unabated thirst So roam I sedulous, hum as I pass, And bear mellifluous treasure to my cell, Song dropping honey, verse distilling balm. Now still night silences both thee and me; And pleas'd that I have sung, place of my birth, Thy pleasures multifarious, pass the sun Through what fair sign it will, I drop the wing, Hie to my grounded nest, and sing no more. THE END.</field>
