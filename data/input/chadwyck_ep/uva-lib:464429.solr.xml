      <field name="fulltext">THE FIRST PART OF The HYMNES and SONGS of the CHVRCH, containing those which are Translated out of the Canonicall Scripture; Together with such other Hymnes, and Creeds, as haue anciently beene sung in the Church of ENGLAND. Song I. The first Song of Moses. Exod. 15. [1] Now shall the praises of the LORD be sung: For, hee a most renowned Triumph wonne: Both Horse and Man into the Sea hee flung; And them together there hath ouerthrowne. The LORD is He, whose strength doth make me strong; And hee is my Saluation and my Song. My GOD, for whom I will a House prepare; My Fathers GOD, whose praise I will declare. 2 Well knowes the LORD to war what doth pertaine; The LORD Almightie is his glorious Name: He Pharaohs Charrets, and his armed Traine, Amid the Sea o'rewhelming, ouercame: Those of his Armie that were most renoun'd, Hee hath together in the Red-sea drown'd; The Deepes, a couering ouer them were throwne, And, to the bottome sunke they, like a stone. 3 LORD, by thy powre thy Right-hand famous growes: Thy Right-hand, LORD, thy Foe destroyed hath: Thy Glory thy Opposers ouerthrowes; And, stubble-like, consumes them in thy wrath. A blast but from thy nostrils forth did goe, And vp together did the waters flow; Yea, rowled vp on heaps; the liquid Flood Amid the Sea, as if congealed, stood. 4 I will pursue them (their Pursuer cri'd) I will o'retake them, and the spoile enioy: My lust vpon them shall be satisfi'd: With Sword vnsheath'd my hand shall them destroy. Then from thy breath a gale of winde was sent: The billowes of the Sea quite o're them went: And they the mightie waters sunke into, Eu'n as a weightie peece of Lead will doe. 5 LORD, who like thee among the GODS is there: In holinesse so glorious who may bee! VVhose praises so exceeding dreadfull are! In doing wonders who, can equall thee! Thy glorious Right-hand thou on high didst reare, And in the earth they quickly swallow'd were: But thou, in mercie, on-ward hast conuai'd Thy People, whose redemption thou hast paid. 6 Them, by thy strength, thou hast bin pleas'd to beare Vnto a holy Dwelling place of thine: The Nations at report thereof shall feare; And grieue shall they that dwell in Palestine, On Edoms Princes shall amazement fall: The mightie men of Moab tremble shall: And, such as in the land of Cana'n dwell, Shall pine away, of this when they heare tell. 7 They shall bee ceazed with a horrid feare: Stone-quiet thy Right hand shall make them be, Till passed ouer, LORD, thy People are; (Till those passe ouer, that were bought by thee.) For, thou shalt make them to thy Hill repaire, And plant them there (oh Lord) where thou art heire; Eu'n there, where thou thy Dwelling hast prepar'd; That Holy place, which thine owne hands haue rear'd. 8 The LORD shall euer, and for euer raigne: (His Soueraignty shall neuer haue an end) For, when as Pharoh did into the Maine VVith Charrets, and with horsemen downe descend, The Lord did backe againe the Sea recall, And with those waters ouerwhelm'd them all: But, through the verie inmost of the same, The Seed of Israel safe and drie-shod came. SONG. III. The Song of Deborah and Barak. Iudg. 5. [1] Sing praises Isr'el to the LORD, that thee auenged so; When to the fight with free accord the people forth did goe. You Kings giue eare; you Princes heare, while to the LORD I raise My voyce aloud, and sing to GOD, (the LORD of Isr'el) praise. 2 When thou departedst, LORD, from Seir; When thou leftst Edom field, Earth shooke, the heauens dropped there, The Cloudes did water yeeld. LORD, at thy sight A trembling fright Vpon the Mountaines fell: Eu'n at thy looke, Mount Sinai shooke, LORD God of Israel. 3 Not long agoe, in Shamghar's dayes, Old Anath's valiant Sonne; And late, in Iael's time, the wayes Frequented were of none: The passengers Were wanderers, In crooked pathes vnknowne; And none durst dwell, Through Israel, But in a walled Towne. 4 Vntill I Deborah arose, (Who rose a Mother there) In Isr'el, when new GODS they chose, That fild their gates with warre. And they had there Nor shield nor Speare In their possession, then; To arme (for fight) One Israelite Mong forty thousand men. 5 To those that Isrel's Captaines are, My heart doth much encline; To those, I meane, that willing were: O LORD the praise be thine. Sing ye, for this, Whose vse it is To ride on Asses gray; All ye, that yet In Middin sit, Or trauell by the way. 6 The place where they their water drew, From Archers now is cleare. The LORDS vprightnes they shall shew, And his iust dealing there. The Hamlets all, Through Isr'el shall His righteousnesse record: And downe vnto The Gates shall goe The people of the LORD. 7 Arise oh Deborah, arise: Rise, rise, and sing a Song. Abinoam's sonne, oh Barak rise: Thy Captiues lead along. Their Princes all, By him made thrall To the Suruiuor bee. To triumph on The Mightie-one, The LORD vouchsafed mee. 8 A roote from out of Ephraim, Gainst Amaleck arose: And (of the people) next to him, The Beniamits were those. From Machir (where Good Leaders are) Came well experienc't men: And they came downe From Zabulon, That handle well the Pen. 6 Along with Deborah did goe The Lords of Isachar; With Isachar, eu'n Barak too, Was one among them there. Hee forth was sent, And marching went On foot the Lower-way. For Ruben (where Diuisions were) Right thoughtfull-hearts had they. 10 The bleating of the flockes to heare, Oh wherefore didst thou stay? For Ruben (where diuisions were) Right thought-full hearts had they. But, why did they, Of Gilead stay On Iordans other side? And wherefore than Didst thou, oh Dan, Within thy Tents abide? 11 Among his harbours lurking by The Sea-side Ashur lay. But Zebulon, and Nephthali Kept not themselues away. They people are, Who fearlesse dare Their liues to death expose; And did not yeelde The hilly-field, Though Kings did them oppose. 12 With them the Cananitish Kings At Tanac'h fought that day, Close by Megiddo's water-springs; Yet bore no Prize away. For, lo, the Starres Fought in their spheres: Gainst Sisera fought they. And some (by force) The water-course Of Kishon, swept away. 13 Eu'n Kishon Riuer, which was long A famous Torrent knowne. Oh thou my soule! oh thou, the strong, Hast brauely troden downe. Their Horse (whose pase So lofty was) Their hoofes with prauncing wound; Those of the Strong, That kickt and flung, And fiercely beat the ground. 14 A heauy curse on Meroz lay: Curst bee her dwellers all. The Angell of the LORD doth say That Citie curse you shall. And therefore this Accursing is; They came not to the sight. To helpe the LORD, (To helpe the LORD) Against the Men of might. 15 But blest bee Iael, Heber's Spouse The Kenite; blest be shee. More then all women are, of those That vse in Tents to bee. To him did shee Giue milke, when hee Did water onely wish; And butter set For him to eate, Vpon a Lordly dish. 16 She in her Left hand tooke a Naile, And rais'd vp in the Right A workemans Hammer, where-withall She Sisera did smite. His head shee tooke, When shee had strooke His pierced Temples through. Hee fell withall: And in the fall, Hee at her feet did bow. 17 Hee at her feet did bow his head; Fell downe, and life forsooke. Meane-while his longing Mother did, From out her window looke: Thus, crying at The Lattice grate, Why staies his Chariot so From hasting home? Oh! wherefore come His Chariot wheeles so slow? 18 As thus she spake, her Ladies-wise To her an answer gaue: Yea, to her selfe, her selfe replies; Sure, sped (saith she) they haue: And all this while, They part the spoyle; A Damsell one, or twaie, Each homeward beares, And Sisera shares A partie-coulor'd pray. 19 Of Needle-worke, both sides of it In diuers colours are; And such it is, as doth befit the Spoylers necke to weare. So LORD, still so, Thy foes o're-throw: But, who in thee delight, Oh! let them be Sun-like, when hee Ascendeth in his might. SONG. V. The Lamentation of Dauid ouer Saul, and Ionathan his sonne 2. Sam. 1., 17. [1] Thy beauty Israel is gone; slaine on the Places-high is hee: The Mightie now are ouerthrowne. Oh, thus how commeth it to bee! Let not this newes their streets throughout, In Gath, or Askalon, be told For feare Philistia's daughters flout: Lest vaunt th'vncircumcized should. 2 On you hereafter, let no dewe You Mountaines of Gilboa fall: Let there be neither showers on you, Nor Fields, that breede an Offring shall. For there, with shame, away was throwne The Target of the Strong (alas) The Shield of Saul; eu'n as of One, That ne're with Oyle annointed was. 3 Nor from their blood that slaughter'd lay, Nor from the fat of strong-men slaine, Came Ionathan his Bow away, Nor drew forth Saul his Sword in vaine. In life-time, they were louely faire; In death they vndiuided are. More swift then Eagles of the ayre, And stronger they, then Lyons were. 4 Weeepe Israels Daughters, weepe for Saul, Who you with Skarlet hath arai'd; VVho cloathed you with Pleasures all, And on your Garments, Gold hath laid. How comes it, hee that mightie was, The foyle in battaile doth sustaine! Thou Ionathan, oh thou (alas) Vpon thy Places-high, wert slaine. 5 And much distressed is my heart, My Brother Ionathan, for thee: My verie Deare-delight thou wert, And wondrous was thy Ioue to mee. So wondrous, it surpassed farre The loue of Women (eu'ry way) Oh, how the Mighty fallen are! How warlike Instruments decay! SONG VI. Dauids Thanksgiuing. 1. Chro. 29. 10. Sing this as the fift Song. [1] Oh LORD, our euerlasting GOD, Blisse, Greatnesse, Power and Praise is thine: With thee haue Conquests their abode, And glorious Maiestie Diuine. All things that Earth and Heau'n afford, Thou at thine owne disposing hast. To thee belongs the Kingdome, LORD, And thou, for Head, o're all art plac't. 2 Thou wealth and honour do'st command; To thee made subiect all things bee: Both Strength &amp; Pow're are in thine hand, To bee dispos'd as pleaseth thee. And now, to thee our GOD therefore, A Song of Thankefulnesse wee frame; (That what wee owe, wee may restore) And glorifie thy glorious Name. 3 But what, or who are wee (alas) That wee in giuing are so free! Thine owne before, our Offring was, And all wee haue, wee haue from thee. For, wee are Guests and Strangers here, As were our Fathers in thy sight: Our daies but shaddow-like appeare, And suddenly they take their flight. 4 This Offring, LORD our GOD, which thus Wee for thy Names-sake, haue bestowne, Deriued was from thee, to vs; And that wee giue, is all thine owne. O GOD, thou prou'st the heart, wee knowe, And do'st affect vprightnesse there: With gladnesse, therefore, wee bestow What wee haue freely offer'd here. 5 Still thus (Oh LORD our GOD) encline Their meanings, who thy People bee. And euer let the hearts of thine Be thus prepared vnto thee. Yea, giue vs perfect hearts, wee pray, That wee thy Precepts erre not from: And graunt, our Contribution may An honour to thy Name become. THE SONG OF SONGS. SONG IX. The first Canticle. [Come kisse mee with those lips of thine] [1] Come kisse mee with those lips of thine; For, better are thy Loues then wine: And as the powred Oyntments bee; Such is the fauour of thy Name: And for the sweetnesse of the same, The Virgins are in loue with thee. 2 Begin but Thou to draw me on, And then wee after Thee will runne: Oh, King, thy Chambers bring me to; So, wee in thee delight shall finde, And more then wine thy loue will minde; And loue thee, as the Righteous doe. 3 And Daughters of Ierusalem, I pray you, doe not mee contemne, Because that blacke I now appeare: For, I as louely am (I know) As Kedar Tents (appeare in showe) Or Salomon his Curtaines are. 4 Though blacke I am, regard it not: It is but Sun-burne I haue got; Whereof my Mothers Sons were cause: Their Vineyard-keeper me they made. (Through enuy which to me they had) So, mine owne Vine, neglected was. 5 Thou, whom my soule doth best affect, Vnto thy pastures me direct, Where thou at Noone, art stretcht along. For, why should I be stragling spide, Like her that loues to turne aside, Thy fellow-shepheards flocks among! 6 Oh, fairest of all Womankinde! (If him thou know not where to finde) Goe, where the paths of Castell are: Their Tract of foot-steps stray not from, Till to the Shepherds Tents thou come; And feede thy tender Kidlings there. 7 My Loue, thou art of greater force, Then Pharaoh's troups of Charret-horse. Thy cheekes, and necke made louely bee With rowes of stone, and many a chaine: And, wee gold borders will ordaine, Beset with siluer studs, for thee. SONG X. The second Canticle. While that the King was at repast Sing this as the ninth Song. [1] While that the King was at repast, My Spicknard his perfumings cast; And twixt my breasts repos'd my Deere: My Loue, who is as sweet to mee, As Myrrhe, or Camphire bundles bee, Which at Engaddi Vineyards are. 2 Loe, thou art faire; loe, thou my Loue, Art faire, and eyed like the Doue: Thou faire, and pleasant art my Deare: And loe, our bed with flowers is strow'd: Our House is beam'd with Cædar wood; And of the Firre our Rafters are. 3 I am the Rose that Sharon yeelds, The Rose and Lilly of the Fields, And flower of all the Dales below. My Loue among the Daughters showes, As when a sweet and beauteous Rose Amid her bush of thornes doth grow. 4 Among the Sonnes, such is my Deare, As doth an Apple-tree appeare, Within a shrubbie Forrest plac't. I sate me downe beneath his shade, (Whereto a great desire I had) And sweet his fruit was to my tast. 5 Mee to his Banquet-house he bare, Eu'n where his wine prouisions are, And there, his Loue my banner was. With Flaggons, mee from fainting stay; With Apples comfort me, I pray; For, I am sicke of Loue (alas) 6 My head with his left-hand he staid: His right-hand ouer mee he laid; And by the Harts and Roes (said Hee) You Daughters of Ierusalem, Stirre not (for you I charge by them) Nor, wake my Loue, till pleas'd she be. SONG XI. The third Canticle. I heare my Loue, and him I see Sing this as the fift Song. [1] I heare my Loue, and him I see Come leaping by the Mountains there: Loe, o're the Hillocks trippeth Hee; And Roe, or Stag-like doth appeare. Loe, from behind the wall he pries: Now, at the window grate is hee: Now speakes my Deare, and saies, Arise, My Loue, my Faire, and come with mee. 2 Loe, Winters past, and comne the Spring, The Raine is gone, the Weather cleare: The Season woes the Birds to sing, And on the Earth the flowers appeare. The Turtle croweth in our Field: Young Figs the Fig-tree down doth weigh, The blossom'd Vines a sauour yeeld; Rise Loue, my Faire, and come away. 3 My Doue, that art obscured, where The Rockes darke staires doe thee infold: Thy voyce, (thy sweet voice) let me hear, And Thee, (that louely sight) behold. Those Foxes-Cubs, the Vines that mar, Goe take vs whilst the Grapes be young: My Loues am I, and mine's my Deare, Who feeds the Lilly-flowers among. 4 While breake of Day, when shades depart, Returne my Well-beloued-One; Eu'n as a Roe, or lusty Hart, That doth on Bether Mountaines runne, For him, that to my soule is deare, Within my bed, by night I sought; I sought, but him I found not there: Thus therfore with my selfe I thought; 5 I'le rise, and round the Cittie wend, Through Lanes, and open waies I'le goe, That I my Soules-delight may finde: So, there I sought, and mist him too. The Cittie watch me lighted on; Then askt I for my soules delight: And somewhat past them being gone, My soules-beloued found I straight. 6 Whom, there in my embrace I caught; And him forsooke I not, till hee Into my Mothers house I brought; Her Chamber who conceiued mee. You Daughters of Ierusalem, Stirre not (by field bred Harts and Roes; For you I doe adiure by them) Nor wake my Loue till shee dispose. SONG XII. The fourth Canticle. What hee, that from the Desert there Sing this as the fift Song. [1] What hee, that from the Desert there Doth like those smoakie pillars come, Which from the Incense and the Mirrhe, And all the Merchant spices fume? His Bed (which, loe, is Salomons) Threescore stout men about it stand: They are of Israel's valiant-Ones; And all of them with Swords in hand. 2 All those are men expert in fight; And each one on his thigh doth weare A sword, that terrours of the night May bee forbid, from comming there. King Salomon, a goodly place, With trees of Libanon did reare: Each piller of it Siluer was; And gold the bases of them were. 3 With purple couer'd he the same; And all the pauement (thoroughout) Oh Daughters of Ierusalem, For you, with charitie is wrought. Come Syon Daughters, come away, And crowned with his Diadem King Salomon behold yee may: That Crowne his Mother set on him, When he a married man was made, And at the heart contentment had. SONG XIII. The fift Canticle. Oh my Loue, how comely now [1] Oh my Loue, how comely now, and how beautifull art thou Thou of Doue-like Eies a paire, Shining hast within thy haire: And thy Lockes like Kidlings bee, VVhich from Gilead hill wee see. 2 Like those Ewes thy Teeth doe show, Which in rowes from washing goe; When among them there is none Twinlesse, nor a barren one. And thy Lips are of a red; Like the Rosie-colour'd thread. 3 Speech becomming thee thou hast. Vnderneath thy Tresses plac't Are thy Temples (matchlesse faire) Which (o'reshadow'd with thy haire) Like Pomegranats doe appeare, When they cut asunder are. 4 To that Fort thy Neck's compar'd, Which with Bulwarkes Dauid rear'd; Where a thousand shields are hung, All the Targets of the Strong. Breasts thou hast like twinned Roes, Feeding where the Lilly growes. 5 While day-breake, and shades are gone, To the Mountains I will runne: To that hill whence Mirrhe doth come, And to that of Libanum. Thou my Loue all beautie art, Spotlesse-faire in eu'ry part. 6 Come my Spouse from Libanum, Come with mee from Libanum. From Amana turne thy sight, Shenir's top, and Hermons height; From the dennes of Lyons fell, And the hills where Leopards dwell. 7 Thou, my Sister, thou art shee, Of my heart that robbeth mee; Thou, my Spouse, oh thou art shee, Of my heart that robbeth me, With one of thine eies aspect, And with one locke of thy necke. 8 Sister, and espoused-Peere, Those thy Breasts how farre they are! Better be those Dugs of thine, Then the most delitious wine: And thine Oyntments odours are, Sweeter then all Spices farre. 9 Loue, thy Lips drop sweetnesse so, As the Combs of Hony doe. Thou hast vnderneath thy Tongue Hony mixt with Milke among. And thy Robes doe sent as well, As the Frankincense doth smell. 10 Thou, my Sister, and espous'd, Art a Garden, fast inclos'd; Walled-Spring, a Fountaine seal'd; And the Plants thy Orchyard yeeld Are of the Pomgranate-tree, With those fruits that pleasant bee. 11 Camphire there with Nard doth grow, Nard, commixt with Crocus too, Calamus, and Cinamon, with all trees of Libanum; Sweetest Aloes and Myrrhe, And all Spice that precious are. 12 All the Gardens eu'ry where, Take their first beginning there. There the precious Fountaine lies, Whence all liuing waters rise: Euen all those Streames that come, Running downe from Libanum. SONG. XIIII. The sixt Canticle. Arise thou North-winde from the North [1] Arise thou North-winde from the North, And from the South, thou South-winde blow: Vpon my Garden breath yee forth, That so my Spices (there that grow,) From thence abundantly may flow. And to thy Garden come my Deare, To eate thy fruits of pleasure there. 2 My Sister, and espoused Peere, Vnto my Garden I am come: My Spice I gather'd with my Myrrhe: I ate my Hony in the Combe, And drunk my wine with milke among. Come Friends, and Best-belou'd of mee, Come eate, and drinke, and merry bee 3 I slept, but yet my heart did wake It is my Loue I knocking heare: It was his Voyce, and thus he spake; Come open vnto mee, my Deare, My Loue, my Doue, my Spotlesse-Peere: For, with the deaw my head is dight; My Locks with droppings of the night. 4 Loe, I haue now vndressed mee: Why should I cloath me, as before? And since my feet cleane washed be, Why should I soyle them anymore? Then, through the Crevice of the doore Appear'd the Hand of my Belou'd; And towards him my heart was mou'd. 5 I rose vnto my Loue to ope, And from my Hands distilled Myrrhe; Pure Myrrhe did from my fingers drop Vpon the handles of the Barre. But, then departed was my Deare. When by his Voyce I knew 'twas he, My heart was like to faint in mee. 6 I sought; but seene he could not be: I call'd; but heard no answer sound. The Citie-Watchmen met with me, As they were walking of the Round, And gaue me stripes that made a wound: Yea, they that watch &amp; ward the Wall, Eu'n they haue tooke away my veyle. SONG XV. The seuenth Canticle. Oh! if him you happen on Sing this as the 13 Song. [1] Oh! if him you happen on, Who is my Beloved One, Daughters of Ierusalem; I adiure you, seriously, To informe him, how that I Sicke am growne of loue for him. 2 Fairest of all women, tell How thy Louer doth excell, More then other Louers doe. Thy Beloued, what is hee More then other Louers bee, That thou dost adiure vs so? 3 Hee, in whom I so delight, Is the purest Red and White; Often thousands, Chiefe is he. Like fine Gold, his Head doth show, Whereon curled Lockes doe grow; And a Rauen-blacke they bee. 4 Like the milkie Doues that bide By the Riuers, he is Ey'd: Full, and fitly set they are: Cheekes like Spicy-Beds hath he; Or like flowers, that fairest be: Lips like Lillies, dropping Myrrhe. 5 Hands, like Rings of Gold beset With the precious Chrysolet: Belly'd like white Iuory, Wrought about with Saphires rich: Legges, like Marble Pillars, which Set on Golden Bases bee. 6 Fac'd like Libanus is hee: Goodly, as the Cedar-tree: Sweetnesse breathing out of him. Hee is louely eu'ry where. This my Friend is, this my Deare, Daughters of Ierusalem. 7 Oh, thou Fayrest (eu'ry way) Of all Women! whither may Thy Beloued turned be? Tell vs, whither he is gone, Who is thy Beloued-one, That wee seeke him may with thee. 8 To his Garden wont my Deare, To the Beds of Spices there; Where he feeds, and Lillies gets. I my Loues am, and alone Mine is my Beloued-one, Who among the Lillies eates. SONG. XVI. The eight Canticle. Beautifull art thou, my Deare Sing this as the 13 Song. [1] Beautifull art thou, my Deare: Thou as louely art, as are Tirzah, or Ierusalem, (As the beautifull'st of them) And as much thou mak'st afraid, As arm'd Troups with Flagges display'd. 2 Turne away those eyes of thine; Doe not fix them so on mine: For, there beame forth from thy sight, Sweetes, that ouercome mee quite: And thy Lockes like Kidlings bee, Which from Gilead hill wee see. 3 Like those Ewes thy Teeth doe show, Which in rowes from washing goe, VVhen among them there is none, Twinlesse, nor a Barren one. And (within thy locks) thy Browes Like the cut Pomegranat showes. 4 There are with her sixtie Queenes: There are eightie Concubines; And the Damsels they possesse, Are in number numberlesse. But my Doue is all alone, And an vndefiled one. 5 Shee's her Mothers onely Deare, And her Ioy that her did beare: When the Daughters her suruei'd, That she blessed was, they said; She was praised of the Queenes, And among the Concubines. 6 Who is she (when forth she goes) That so like the Morning showes? Beautifull, as is the Moone, Purely bright, as is the Sunne: And appearing full of dread: Like an Hoast with Ensignes spread? 7 To the Nut-yard downe went I, (And the Vales encrease to spie) To behold the Vine-Buds come, And to see Pomegranats bloome: But the Princes Charrets did Vex me so, I nought could heed. 8 Turne, oh turne, thou Shulamite, Turne, oh turne thee to our sight. What, I pray, is that, which you In the Shulamite would view, But that (to apparance) she Shewes like Troups, that armed bee? SONG XVII. The ninth Canticle. Thou Daughter of the Royall Line Sing this as the 9 Song. [1] Thou Daughter of the Royall Line. How comely are those Feet of thine, When their beseeming Shooes they weare? The curious knitting of thy Thighes, Is like the costly Gemmes of prize, Which wrought by skilful workm? are. 2 Thy Nauell, is a Goblet round, Where Liquor euermore is found: Thy faire and fruitfull Belly showes As doth a goodly heap of Wheat, With Lillies round about beset; And thy two Breasts like twinned Roes. 3 Thy Neck like some white towre doth rise: Like Heshbon Fish-Pooles are thine Eyes, Which neare the Gate Bath-rabbim lye: Thy Nose (which thee doth well become) Is like the Towre of Libanum, Which on Damascus hath an eye. 4 Thy Head like Scarlet doth appeare, The Hayres thereof like Purple are: And in those Threads the King is bound. Oh Loue! how wondrous faire art thou! How perfect doe thy Pleasures show! And how thy Ioyes in them abound! 5 Thou Statur'd art in Palme-tree wise: Thy Breasts like Clusters doe arise. I said, into this Palme Ile goe; My hold shall on her Branches be, And those thy Breasts shall bee to mee Like Clusters that on Vines doe grow. 6 Thy Nosthrills sauour shall as well, As newly gather'd Fruits doe smell: Thy Speech shall also relish so, As purest Wine, that for my Deare Is fitting Drinke; and able were To cause an old mans Lippes to goe. 7 I my Beloued's am; and hee Hath his affection set on me. Come, Well-beloued, come away: Into the Fields let's walke along; And there the Villages among, Eu'n in the Countrey, wee will stay. 8 We to the Vines betimes will goe, And see, if they doe Spring or no; Or, if the tender Grapes appeare. We will moreouer, goe and see, If the Pomegranats blossom'd be: And I my Loue will giue thee there. 9 Sweet smells, the Mandrakes doe afford: And we within our Gates are stor'd Of all things that delightfull bee; Yea, whether new or old they are, Prepared they be for my Deare; And I haue laid them vp for thee. 10 Would as my Brother thou might'st be That suck't my Mothers Breast with me: Oh! would it were no otherwise! In publike then I thee would meet, And giue thee kisses in the street; And none there is should thee despise. 11 Then I my selfe would for thee come, And bring thee to my Mothers home: Thou likewise should'st instruct me there. And Wine, that is commixt with Spice, (Sweet wine of the Pomegranat Iuyce) I would for thee, to drinke prepare. 12 My Head with his left Hand he staid: His right Hand ouer me he laid; And (being so embrac't by him) Said he, I charge you not disease, Nor wake my Loue vntill she please, You Daughters of Ierusalem. SONG XVIII. The tenth Canticle. Who's this, that leaning on her Friend [1] Who's this, that leaning on her Friend, Doth from the Wildernes ascend? Mind how I raised thee, Eu'n where thy Mother thee conceiu'd, (where shee that broght thee forth conceiu'd) beneath an Appletree. 2 Me in thy heart engrauen beare, And Seale-like on thy handwrist weare; For, Loue is strong as Death: Fierce as the Graue is Iealousie: The coales thereof doe burning lye; And furious flames it hath. 3 Much water, cannot coole Loues flame: No floods haue power to qu?ch the same. For Loue so high is priz'd, That who to buy it would assay Though all his wealth hee gaue away, It would be all despiz'd. 4 Wee haue a Sister scarcely growne; For, she is such a little one, That yet no Breasts hath shee. What thing shall wee now vndertake, To doe for this our Sisters sake, If spoken for she be? 5 If that a Wall she doe appeare, Wee Turrets vpon her will reare, And Pallaces of Plate; And then with bordes of Cædar-tree, Enclose, and fence her in will we, If that she be a Gate. 6 A Wall already built I am; And now my Breasts vpon the same Doe Turret-like arise: Since when, as one that findeth rest, (And is of setled peace possest) I seemed in his eyes. 7 A Vineyard hath King Salomon: This Vineyard is at Baal-hammon, Which he to Keepers put: And eu'ry one that therein wrought, A thousand siluer-peeces brought, And gaue him for the fruit. 8 My Vineyard which belongs to mee, Eu'n I my selfe doe ouersee. To thee, Oh Salomon, A thousand fold doth appertaine; And, those that keep the same, shall gaine Two hundred-fold for one. 9 Thou, whose abode the Gardens are, (Thy Fellowes vnto thee giue eare) Cause me to heare thy voyce; And let my Loue as swiftly goe, As doth a Hart or nimble Roe, Vpon the Hills of Spice. The Lamentations of Ieremie. SONG XXIIII. Lament. 1. [1] How sad and solitarie now (alas) is that wel-peopled Citie come to be, which once so great among the Nations Was: And, oh how widdow-like appeareth she! She rule of all the Prouinces hath had; And now her selfe is tributarie made. 2 All night shee maketh such excessiue mone That downe her Cheekes a flood of teares doth flow: And yet, among her Louers there is none, That Consolation doth on her bestow. For, they that once her Louers did appeare, Now, turned Foes, and faithlesse to her are. 3 Now Iudah in Captiuitie complaines, That (others) heretofore so much opprest: For her false seruice, She her selfe remaines Among those Heathens, where she finds no rest: And apprehended in a Strait is she, By those that persecutors of her be 4 The very waies of Sion doe lament: The Gates thereof their lonelinesse deplore; Because that no man commeth to frequent Her solemne Festiualls, as heretofore: Her Priests doe sigh; Her tender Virgins bee Vncomfortable left; And so is Shee. 5 Her Aduersaries are become her Chiefes: On high exalted those that hate her are: And God hath brought vpon her all those griefes; Because so many her transgressions were: Her Children driuen from her by the Foe, Before him into loathed Thraldome goe. 6 From Sions Daughter (once without compare) Now all her matchlesse louelinesse is gone: And like those chased Harts her Princes fare, Who seeke for pasture and can finde out none: So, (of their strength depriu'd, and fainting nigh) Before their abler Foes they feebly flie. 7 Ierusalem now thinkes vpon her Crimes, And calls to minde, (amid her present woes) The pleasures she enioy'd in former times, Till first shee was surprised by her Foes; And how, (when they perceiued her forlorne) They at her holy Sabbaths made a scorne. 8 Ierusalem's Transgressions many were, And therfore is it she disdained lies: Those, who in former times haue honour'd her, Her basenesse now behold, and her despise; Yea, She Her-selfe doth sit bewailing this; And of Her-selfe Her-selfe ashamed is. 9 Her owne vncleannesse in her skirt she bore; Not then beleeuing what her end would bee: This great destruction falls on her therefore; And none to helpe, or comfort her, hath she. Oh, heed thou, Lord, and pittie thou my woes: For, I am triumph't ouer by my Foes. 10 Her Foe hath touch'd with his polluted hand, Her things that Sacred were, before her face; And they whose entrance thou did'st countermand, Intruded haue into her Holy place: Those that were not so much approu'd by Thee, As of thy Congregation held to be. 11 Her People doe with sighs, and sorrowes, get That little bread, which for reliefe they haue; And giue away their precious things for meat, So to procure wherewith their liues to saue. Oh Lord consider this, and ponder Thou, How vile, and how deiected I am now. 12 No pittie in you passengers is there? Your eies, oh somewhat hitherward encline; And marke, if euer any griefe there were, Or sorrow that did equall this of mine: This, which the Lord on me inflicted hath, Vpon the day of his incensed wrath. 13 He from aboue a flame hath hurled downe; That kindles in my bones preuailing fire: A Net he ouer both my feet hath throwne, By which I am compelled to retire; And he hath made me a Forsaken-one, To sit, and weepe out all the day alone. 14 The heauie Yoke, of my Transgressions now, His hand hath wreathed, and vpon me laid: Beneath the same my tyred necke doth bow, And all my strength is totally decay'd. For me to those the Lord hath giuen o're, Whose hands will hold me fast for euermore. 15 The Lord hath trampled vnderneath their Feet, Eu'n all the Mightie, in the mid'st of Me: A great Assembly he hath caus'd to meet, That all my ablest men might slaughtred be; And Iudah's Virgin-Daughter treads vpon, As in a Wine-presse Grapes are troden on. 16 For this (alas) thus weepe I; And mine eies, Mine eies drop water thus; because that he, On whose assistance my sad Soule relies; In my distresse is farre away from me; Eu'n while (because of my prevailing Foe) My Children are compeld from me to goe. 17 In vaine hath Sion stretched forth her hand; For, none vnto her succour draweth nigh; Because the Lord hath giuen in command, That Iacobs Foes should round about her lie; And poore Ierusalem among them there, Like some defiled woman doth appeare. 18 The Lord is iustified nay-the-lesse, Because I did not his commands obey. All Nations therefore heare my heauinesse, And heed it (for your warning) you I pray. For, into thraldome (through my follies) be My Virgins, and my Youngmen borne from me. 19 Vpon my Louers I haue cried out; But they my groundlesse hopes deceiued all: I for my reu'rend Priests enquir'd about; I also did vpon mine Elders call: But, in the Citie vp the Ghost they gaue, As they were seeking meat their liues to saue. 20 Oh Lord, take pittie now on my distresse: For loe, my soule distemper'd is in mee: My heart is ouercome with heauinesse; Because I haue so much offended thee. Thy Sword abroad my ruine doth become; And Death doth also threaten me at home. 21 And of my sad complaints my Foes haue heard, But to afford me comfort there is none. My troubles haue at full to them appear'd; Yet they are ioyfull that thou so hast done. But thou wilt bring the Time set downe by thee, And then in sorrow they shall equall me. 22 Then shall those foule Offences they haue wrought, Before thy presence be remembred all; And whatsoe're my Sinnes on me haue brought, (For their Transgressions) vpon them shall fall. For, so my sighings multiplied be, That the rewithall my heart is faint in me. SONG. XXV. Lament. 2. Sing this as the 24. Song. [1] How darke, and how beclowded (in his wrath) The Lord hath caused Sion to appeare! How Isr'els beautie he obscured hath, As if throwne downe from heau'n to earth he were! Oh, why is his displeasure growne so hot? And why hath he his Foot-stoole so forgot? 2 The Lord all Sions dwellings hath laid wast; And in so doing, he no sparing made: For, in his anger to the ground he cast The strongest holds that Iudah's Daughter had: Them, and their Kingdome he to ground doth send, And all the Princes of it doth suspend. 3 When at the highest his displeasure was, From Isr'el all his horne of strength he broke; And from before his aduersaries face, His Right-hand (that restrained him) he tooke; Yea, he in Iacob kindled such a flame, As round about hath quite consum'd the same, 4 His Bow he as an Aduersarie bent, And by his Right-hand he did plainely shew, He drew it with an Enemies intent: For, all that were the fairest Markes he slew: In Sions Tabernacle this was done; Eu'n there the fire of his displeasure shone. 5 The Lord himselfe was he that was the Foe: By him is Isr'el thus to ruine gone: His Palaces he ouerturned so; And He his Holds of strength hath ouerthrowne: Eu'n He it is, from whom it doth arise, That Isr'els Daughter thus lamenting lies. 6 His Tabernacle, Garden-like that was, The Lord with violence hath tooke away: He hath destroyed his Assembling place; And there, nor Feasts, nor Sabboths now haue they: No not in Sion. For, in his fierce wrath, He both their King and Priests reiected hath. 7 The Lord his holy Altar doth forgoe; His Sanctuarie he hath quite despiz'd. Yea, by his meere assistance hath our Foe The Bulwarkes of our Palaces surpriz'd; And in the Lords owne House rude Noises are As loud as heretofore his Praises were. 8 The Lord, his thought did purposely encline, The Walls of Sion should be ouerthrowne: To that intent he stretched forth his Line, And drew not backe his hand till they were downe, And so the Turrets with the bruised Wall, Did both together to destruction fall. 9 Her Gates in heaps of Earth obscured are; The Barres of them in pieces, broke hath he: Her King, and those that once her Princes were, Now borne away among the Gentiles be. The Law is lost, and they no Prophet haue, That from the Lord a Vision doth receiue. 10 In silence, seated on the lowly ground, The Senators of Sions Daughter are: With Ashes they their carefull heads haue crown'd, And mourning Sack-cloth girded on them weare; Yea, on the Earth, in a distressed wise, Ierusalem's young Virgins fixe their eies. 11 And for because my People suffer this, Mine eies with much lamenting dimmed grow: Each part within me out of quiet is; And on the ground my Liuer forth I throw; When as mine eies with so sad Obiects meet; As Babes halfe dead, and sprawling in the street. 12 For, to their Mothers called they for meat; Oh where shall we haue meat and drinke! they crie: And in the Citie, while they food entreat, They swone, like them that deadly-wounded lye: And some of them their Soules did breath away, As in the Mothers bosome staru'd they lay. 13 Ierusalem, for thee what can I say? Or vnto what maist thou resembled be? Oh! whereunto, that comfort thee I may, Thou Sions Daughter, shall I liken thee? For, as the Sea's, so great thy Breaches are: And to repaire them then; Ah who is there! 14 Thou by thy Prophets hast deluded beene; And foolish Visions they for thee haue sought. For, they reuealed not to thee thy sinne, To turne away the thraldome it hath brought: But lying Prophesies they sought for thee; Which of thy sad exile the Causes be. 15 And those, thou Daughter of Ierusalem, That on occasions passe along this way, With clapping hands, and hissings, thee contemne; And nodding at Thee, thus in scorne they say; Is this the Citie, men did once behight, The Flowre of Beautie, and the Worlds Delight? 16 Thy Aduersaries (eu'ry one of them) Their mouths haue open'd at thee, to thy shame: They hisse, and gnash at Thee, Ierusalem; We, we (say they) haue quite destroi'd the same: This is that day hath long expected beene, Now commeth it, and we the same haue seene. 17 But, this the Lord decreed, and brought to passe: Hee, to make good that Word which once he spake, (And that which long agoe determin'd was) Hath hurled downe, and did no pittie take: He thus hath made thee scorned of thy Foe, And rais'd the Horne of them that hate thee so. 18 Oh Wall of Sions Daughter, cry amaine, Eu'n to the Lord set forth a heartie Cry: Downe, like a Riuer, cause thy teares to raine, And let them neither Day nor Night be dry. Seeke neither sleepe, thy body to suffice, Nor slumber for the Apples of thine eies. 19 At night, and when the Watch is new begun, Then rise, and to the Lord Almightie Crie: Before him let thy Heart like water runne, And lift thou vp to him thy Hands on high, Eu'n for those hunger-starued Babes of thine, That in the Corners of the Streets doe pine. 20 And thou, oh Lord; Oh be thou pleas'd to see, And thinke on whom thy iudgments thou hast thrown Shall women fed with their owne Issue be, And Children that a span are scarcely growne? Shall thus thy Priests and Prophets, Lord, be slaine, As in thy Sanctuarie they remaine? 21 Nor Youth, nor Age, is from the slaughter free; For, in the Streets lye Young and Old, and all: My Virgins, and my young men, murthered be; Eu'n both beneath the Sword together fall. Thou, in thy Day of Wrath such hauocke mad'st, That in deuowring thou no pittie had'st. 22 Thou, round about hast call'd my feared Foes, As if that summond to some Feast they were: Who in thy Day of Wrath did round enclose, And shut me so that none escaped are: Yea, those that hate me them consumed haue, To whom I nourishment, and breeding gaue. SONG. XXVI. Lament. 3. Sing this as the 24. Song. [1] I am the Man, who (scourged in his wrath) Haue in all sorrowe I throughly tried beene: Into obscuritie he led me hath: He brought me thither where no light is seene: And so aduerse himselfe to me he showes, That all the day his hand doth me oppose. 2 My flesh and skinne with age he tired out: He bruiz'd my bones as they had broken beene: Hee with a Wall enclosed me about: With cares and labours he hath shut me in; And me to such a place of darkenesse led, As those are in that be for euer dead. 3 He shut me where I found no passage out; And there my heauy chaines vpon me laid. Moreouer, though I loudly cried out, He tooke no heede at all for what I praid: My Way, with hewed stones he stopped hath, And left me wandring, in a winding path. 4 He was to me like some way-laying Beare; Or as a Lyon that doth lurke vnseene: My course he hindring, me in peeces tare, Till I quite ruin'd and laid wast had beene; His Bow he bended, and that being bent, I was the marke, at which his Arrow went 5 His Arrowes from his Quiuer forth he caught, And through my verie Raines he made them passe: Eu'n mine owne people set me then at naught; And all the day their sporting-Song I was: From him my fill of bitternesse I had; And me with Wormwood likewise drunke he made. 6 With stones my teeth he all to pieces brake: He dust and ashes ouer me hath strowne: All rest hee from my weary soule did take, As if contentment I had neuer none. And then I cried; Oh, I am vndone; All my dependance on the Lord is gone. 7 Oh, mind thou my afflictions and my care; My miseries, my Wormewood, and my Gall: For, they still fresh in my remembrance are; And downe in me my humbled soule doth fall. I this forget not, and when this I minde, Some helpe againe, I doe begin to finde. 8 It is thy mercy, Lord, that we now be: For, had thy pitty fail'd, not one had liu'd: The faithfulnesse is great that is in Thee; And eu'ry morning it is new reuiu'd. And Lord, such claime my soule vnto thee laies, That she will euer trust in thee, shee saies. 9 For, thou art kinde to those that worke thy will; And to their soules that after thee attend, Good therefore is it, that in quiet still We hope that safety, which thou Lord, wilt send. And happie he that timely doth enure His youthfull necke, the burthen to endure. 10 He downe will sit alone, and nothing say; But, since 'tis cast vpon him beare it out. (Yea, though his mouth vpon the dust they lay) And, while there may be hope, will not misdoubt. His cheeke to him that smiteth, offers he; And is content, though he reuiled be. 11 For, sure is he (what euer doth befall) The Lord, will not forsake for euermore: But that he hauing punish't, pittie shall; Because he many mercies hath in store. For, God in plaguing take no pleasure can, Nor willingly afflicteth any man. 12 The Lord delighteth not to trample downe Those men that here on earth enthralled are: Or that a righteous man should be o'rethrowne, When hee before the highest doth appeare. Nor is the Lord well pleased in the sight, When he beholds the wrong, subuert the Right. 13 Let no man mutter then, as if he thought Some things were done in spight of Gods decree? For, all things at his word to passe are brought, That either for our good or euill be. Why then liues man such murmures to begin? Oh! let him rather murmur at his sinne. 14 Our owne lewd Courses let vs search and trie, Wee may to thee againe, Oh Lord, conuart. To God that dwelleth in the heauens on high, Let vs (oh let vs) lift both hand and heart: For, wee haue sinned; we rebellious were; And therefore was it that thou didst not spare. 15 For this (with wrath o'reshadow'd) thou hast chac't And slaughter made of vs without remorse: Thy selfe obscured with a cloud thou hast, That so our praiers might haue no recourse; And loe, among the Heathen-people, we As out-casts, and off-scourings reckon'd be. 16 Our Aduersaries all (and euery where) Themselues, with open mouth, against vs set. On vs is falne a Terrour, and a snare, Where Ruine hath with Desolation met; And, for the Daughter of my Peoples cares, Mine eies doe cast forth Rivulets of teares. 17 Mine eies perpetually were ouerflowne; And yet there is no ceasing of my Teares. For, if the Lord in mercie looke not downe, That from the heau'ns he may behold my cares, They will not stint: But, for my peoples sake, Mine eies will weep, vntill my heart doth breake. 18 As, when a Bird is chased to and fro, My Foes pursued me when cause was none: Into the Dungeon they my life did throw; And there they rowled ouer me a stone. The waters likewise ouerflow'd me quite; And then me thought I perished out-right. 19 Yet on thy Name, Oh Lord, I called there; (Eu'n when in that Low Dungeon I did lye) Whence thou wert pleased my complaint to heare; Not sleighting me when I did sighing cry: That very day I called, thou drew'st neare, And saidst vnto me, that I should not feare. 20 Thou Lord, my soule maintainest in her right: My life by thee alone redeemed was; Thou hast, Oh Lord, obserued my despight; Vouchsafe thy iudgment also in my cause. For, all the grudge they heare me, thou hast seene; And all their plots that haue against me beene. 21 Thou heardst what slanders they against me laid, And all those mischiefes they deuiz'd for me: Thou notest what their lips of me haue said, Eu'n what their daily closest whisprings be; And how (when ere they rise or downe doe lye) Their Song, and subiect of their mirth am I. 22 But, Lord, thou shalt reward and pay them all That meede their actions merit to receiue: Thy heauy malediction ceaze them shall; Eu'n this; Sad hearts they shall for euer haue: And by thy wrath pursude they shall be driuen, Till they are chased out from vnder heauen. SONG XXVII. Lament. 4. Sing this as the fift Song. [1] How dimme the Gold doth now appeare! (That Gold which once so brightly shone) About the Citie here, and there, The Sanctuarie-Stones are throwne. The Sonnes of Sion late compar'd To Gold (the richest in esteeme) Like Potsheards are without regard, And base as earthen vessells seeme. 2 The Monsters of the Sea haue care, Their breasts vnto their young to giue: But crueller my people are; And Estrige-like in Desarts liue. With thirst the Sucklings tongues are drie; And to their parched roofes they cleaue: For bread young children also cry; But none at all they can receiue. 3 Those that were vs'd to daintie fare, Now in the streets halfe starued lie; And they that once did scarlet weare, Now dung-hill rags about them tie; Yea, greater plagues my peoples crime Hath brought on them, then Sodomes were, For, that was sunke in little time, And no prolonged death was there. 4 Her Nazarites, whose whitenesse was More pure, then either Milke or Snow; Whose ruddinesse did Rubies passe; Whose veines did like the Saphire show; Now blacker then the coale are growne; And in the streets vnknowne are they; Their flesh is clung vnto the bone, And like a sticke is dri'd away. 5 Such therefore as the Sword hath slaine, Are farre in better case then those, Who death for want of food sustaine, Whilst in the fruitfull field it growes. For, when my people were distrest, Eu'n women (that should pittie take) With their owne hands their children drest, That so their hunger they might slake. 6 The Lord accomplish't hath his wrath; His fierce displeasure forth is powr'd; A fire on Sion see he hath, Which eu'n her ground-worke hath deuour'd, When there was neither earthly King; Nor through the whole world, one at all, Thought any Foe to passe could bring, That thus Ierusalem should fall. 7 But this hath happened for the guilt Of those that haue her Prophets bin; And those her wicked Priests that spilt The blood of Innocents therein: Along the Streets they stumbling went; (The blindnesse of these men was such) And so with blood they were besprent, That no man would their Garments touch. 8 Depart, depart ('twas therefore sed) From those pollutions get yee far: So wandring to the Heathen fled, And said, there was no biding there: And them the Lord hath now'in wrath Exil'd, and made despised liue; Yea, sent their Priests and Elders hath, Where none doth honour to them giue. 9 And as for vs, our eies decai'd With watching vaine reliefes we haue, Cause we expect a Nations aide, That is vnable vs to saue. For, at our heeles so close they be, We dare not in the streets appeare: Our end we therefore comming see, And know our rooting-out is neare. 10 Our persecutors follow on, As swift as Eagles of the skie: They o're the mountaines make vs runne; And in the Desarts for vs lie: Yea, they haue Christ our life betraid, And caus'd him in their pits to fall; (Eu'n him) beneath whose shade we said. We liue among the Heathen shall. 11 Oh Edom in the Land of Huz, (Though yet o're vs triumph thou may) Thou shalt receiue this Cup from vs; Be drunke, and hurle thy cloaths away. For when thy punishments for sinnes Accomplished, oh Sion, be; To visit Edom he begins And publike make her shame will be. SONG XXVIII. Lament. 5. Sing this as the 5 Song. [1] Oh minde thou Lord, our sad distresse; Behold and thinke on our reproach. Our houses, Strangers doe possesse; And on our heritage encroch. Our Mothers, for their husbands grieue; And of our fathers rob'd are we, Yea, money we compel'd to giue, For our owne wood and water be. 2 In persecution we remaine, Where endlesse labour tire vs doth. And we to serue for bread, are faine To Egypt, and to Ashur both. Our fathers er'd; and being gone, The burthen of their sinne we beare. Eu'n Slaues, the rule o're vs haue won; And none to set vs free is there. 3 For bread, our liues we hazard, in The perills which the Desarts threat. And, like an Ouen is our skin, Both soil'd, and parch't, for want of meat, In Sion, Wiues defiled were, Deflowred were their Virgins young, (Through Iudah's Cities eu'ry where) And Princes by their hands were hung. 4 Her Elders disrespected stood: Her Young-men they for grinding tooke: Her Children fell beneath the wood; And Magistrats the Gate forsooke. Their Musicke, Young-men haue forborne Reioycing in their hearts is none: To mourning doth our dauncing turne: And from our head the Crowne is gone. 5 Alas, that euer we did sinne! For, therefore feeles our heart these cares: For that our eies haue dimmed bin; And thus the hill of Sion fares. Such desolation there is seene, That now the Foxes play thereon: But thou for euer, Lord, hast beene; And without ending is thy Throne. 6 Oh, why are we forgotten thus? So long time wherefore absent art? Conuert thy selfe, oh LORD, to vs; And we to thee shall soone conuart. Renew, oh LORD, those Ages past, In which thy fauour we haue seene, For, we extreamely are debas'd, And bitter hath thine anger beene. THE HYMNES of the new Testament. SONG. XXXII. Magnificat. Luk. 1. 46. Sing this as the 3 Song. [1] That magnifi'de the LORD may be, My Soule now vndertakes; And in the God that saueth me, My Spirit merry-makes. For, he vouchsafed hath to view His Handmaides poore degree. And loe, All Ages that ensue, Shall blessed reckon me. 2 Great things for me Th'Almightie does, And Holy is his Name: From Age to Age he mercie showes On such as feare the same. He by his Arme declard his might: And this to passe hath brought; That now the Proud are put to flight, By what their hearts haue thought. 3 The Mightie plucking from their Seat; The Poore he placed there: And for the Hungrie takes the meat From such, as Wealthy are. But, minding Mercie, he hath show'd His Seruant Isr'el grace: As he to our Forefathers vow'd; To Abraham, and his Race. SONG XXXIII. Benedictus, Luk. 1. 68. Sing this as the third Song. [1] Blest be the God of Israel; For he his People bought, And in his Seruant Dauids house, Hath great Saluation wrought. As by his Prophets he foretold, Since time began to be: That from our Foes we might be safe, And from our Haters free. 2 That he might shew our Fathers Grace, And beare in minde the same, Which by an Oath, he vow'd vnto Our Father Abraham; That from our Aduersaries freed, We serue him fearelesse might, In righteousnesse, and holinesse, Our life time in his sight. 3 And (of the Highest) thee, oh Child! The Prophet, I declare, Before the Lord, his face to goe; His comming to prepare. To teach his People how they shall, That safety come to know, Which by remission of their sinnes, He doth on them bestow. 4 For, it is through the tender loue, Of God alone, whereby, That Day-Spring hath to visit vs, Descended from on high; To light them who in darknesse sit, (And in Death's shade abide,) And in the blessed way of Peace Their wandring Feete to guide. SONG. XXXIV. The Song of Angels. Luk 2. 13. Thus Angells sung, and thus sing we; To GOD on high all glorie be: Let him on Earth his Peace bestowe, And vnto men his Fauour show. SONG XXXV. Nunc Dimittis. Luk. 2. 29. Sing this as the third Song. Grant now in peace (that by thy leaue) I may depart, oh Lord: For, thy Saluation seene I haue, According to thy Word. That which prepared was by Thee, Before all Peoples sight, Thy Israels Renowne to be: And to the Gentiles Light. SONG. XXXVI. The Song of Moses, and the Lambe. Reu. 15. 3. Sing this as the 13. Song. 1 Oh, thou Lord, thou God of might, (Who dost all things worke aright) Whatsoe're is done by thee, Great and wondrous prooues to be. 2 True thy waies are, and direct, Holy King, of Saints elect. And (oh therefore) who is there, That of thee, retaines no feare? 3 Who is there that shall deny, Thy great Name to glorifie? For thou Lord, and thou alone, Art the perfect Holy-One: 4 In thy presence, Nations all Shall to adoration fall. For, thy iudgments now appeare, Vnto all men what they are. Here end the Hymnes of the New Testament. SONG. XXXVII. The X Commandements. Exod. 20. Sing this as the fourth Song. The Great Almightie spake; And thus said he, I am the LORD thy GOD; and I alone From cruell Egypts thraldome set thee free: And other GODS but Me thou shalt haue none. Haue mercie LORD, and so our hearts encline, That wee may keepe this blessed Law of thine. Thou shalt not make an Image, to adore, Of ought on earth, aboue it, or below: A Carued Worke thou shalt not bow before; Nor any worship on the same bestow. For, I thy GOD, a iealous GOD am knowne: And on their Seed, the Fathers sinnes correct, Vntill the third and fourth Descent be gone: But them I alwaies loue that me affect. Have mercy LORD, and so our hearts encline, That we may keepe this blessed Law of thine. The Name of GOD thou neuer shalt abuse, By swearing, or repeating it in vaine: For, him that doth his Name prophanely vse, The LORD will as a guiltie one arraigne. Haue mercie LORD, and so our hearts encline, That we may keepe this blessed Law of thine. To keepe the Sabbath holy beare in minde, Sixe daies thine owne affaires apply thou to: The Seuenth is Gods owne day for rest assign'd, And thou no kinde of Worke therein shalt doe. Thou, nor thy Childe, thy Seruant, nor thy Beast; Nor he that Guest-wise with thee doth abide: For, after six daies labour GOD did rest, And therefore he that day hath sanctifi'de. Haue mercie LORD, and so our hearts encline, That we may keepe this blessed Law of thine. See, that vnto thy Parents thou doe giue Such honour as the Childe by duty owes, That thou a long and blessed life maist liue Within the Land, the LORD thy GOD bestowes. Haue mercie LORD, and so our hearts encline, That wee may keepe this blessed Law of thine. Thou shalt be wary that thou no man slay: Thou shalt from all Adulterie be cleare: Thou shalt not Steale anothers Good away: Nor Witnesse-false against thy Neighbour beare. Haue mercie LORD, and so our hearts encline, That wee may keepe this blessed Law of thine. With what is thine remaining well apaid: Thou shalt not couet what thy Neighbours is, His House, nor Wife, his Seruant, Man, nor Maide, His Oxe, nor Asse, nor any thing of his. Thy mercie LORD, thy mercie let vs haue, And in our hearts these Lawes of thine engraue. SONG. XXXVIII. The Lords Prayer. Mat. 6. 7. Sing this as the third Song. Ovr Father which in heauen art; We sanctifie thy Name: Thy Kingdome come: Thy Will be done In heau'n and earth the same: Giue vs this day our Daily bread: And vs Forgiue thou so; As we on them that vs offend, Forgiuenesse doe bestow: Into Temptation lead vs not; But vs from euill free. For thine the Kingdome, Power, and praise, Is, and shall euer bee. SONG. XXXIX. The Apostles Creed. [1] In GOD the Father I beleeue; Who made all Creatures by his Word; And true beliefe I likewise haue In Iesus Christ, his Sonne, our LORD: Who by the Holy-Ghost conceiu'd, Was of the Virgin Marie borne: Who meekely Pilat's wrongs receiu'd, And crucified was with scorne. 2 Who di'de, and in the graue hath laine; Who did the lowest Pit descend: Who on the third day rose againe, And vp to heauen did ascend Who at his Fathers right-hand there, Now throaned sits, and thence shall come, To take his seat of Iudgement here; And giue both quicke and dead their doome. 3 I, in the Holy Ghost belieue, The holy Church Catholike too, (And that the Saints Communion haue) Vndoubtedly beleeue I doe. I well assured am likewise, A pardon for my sinnes to gaine; And that my Flesh from death shall rise, And euerlasting life obtaine. SONG. XL. A Funerall Song. Sing this as the ninth Song. 1 I am the Life (the LORD thus saith) The Resurrection is through me; And whosoe're in me hath Faith, Shall liue, yea though now dead he be: And he for euer shall not die, That liuing doth on me relye. 2 That my Redeemer liues I weene, And that at last I rais'd shall be From Earth, and, couer'd with my skinne In this my Flesh, my GOD shall see. Yea, with these Eies, and these alone, Eu'n I my GOD shall looke vpon. 3 Into the World we naked come, And naked backe againe we goe: The LORD our wealth receiue we from, And he doth take it from vs too: The LORD both wils and workes the same; And blessed therefore be his Name. 4 From Heau'n there came a voyce to me, And this it wil'd me to record; The Dead from henceforth blessed be, The Dead, that dieth in the LORD: The Spirit thus doth likewise say; For, from their Workes at rest are they. SONG. XLI. The Song of the three Children. [1] Oh all you Creatures of the LORD, You Angels of the GOD most high; You Heau'ns with what you doe afford; And Waters all aboue the skie: Blesse yee the Lord, him praise, adore, And magnifie him euermore. 2 Of God you euerlasting Powres, Sunne, Moone, and Starres, so bright that show; You soaking Deawes, you dropping Showres; And all you Winds of God that blow: Blesse yee the LORD, him praise, adore, And magnifie him euermore. 3 Thou Fire, and what doth heat containe; Cold Winter, and thou Summer faire; You blustring Stormes of Haile and Raine; And thou the Frost-congealing Ayre: Blesse yee the LORD, him praise, adore, And magnifie him euermore. 4 Oh praise him both you Ice and Snow; You Nights and Daies, doe you the same, With what or Darke or Light doth showe; You Clouds and eu'ry shining Flame: Blesse yee the LORD, him praise, adore, And magnifie him euermore. 5 Thou Earth, you Mountaines, and you Hils, And whatsoeuer thereon growes; You Fountains, Riuers, Springs, and Rils; You Seas, and all that ebbes, or flowes: Blesse yee the LORD, him praise, adore, And magnifie him euermore. 6 You Whales, and all the Water yeelds; You of the Feather'd airy breed; You Beasts and Cattle of the Fields; And you that are of Humane seed: Blesse yee the LORD, him praise, adore, and magnifie him euermore. 7 Let Israel the LORD confesse; So let his Priests, that in him trust; Him let his Seruants also blesse; Yee, Soules and Spirits of the Iust: Blesse yee the LORD, him praise, adore, and magnifie him euermore. 8 You blessed Saints, his praises tell; And you that are of humble heart, With Ananias, Misael; And Azarias (bearing part) Blesse yee the LORD, him praise, adore, And magnifie him euermore. SONG. XLII. The Song of S. Ambrose or Te Deum. Sing this as the 44. Song. 1 We praise Thee GOD, we knowledge thee, To be the LORD, for euermore: And the eternall Father we, Throughout the earth, doe thee adore: All Angells, with all powers within The compasse of the Heauens high; Both Cherubin, and Seraphin, To Thee perpetually doe cry. 2 Oh holy, holy, holy-one; Thou LORD, and GOD of Sabboth art; Whose praise, and Maiestie alone Fills Heau'n, and Earth in euery part: The glorious Troupe Apostolike; The Prophets worthy Companie; The Martyrs Armie royall eke Are those, whom thou art praised by. 3 Thou through the holy Church art knowne, The Father of vnbounded powre: Thy worthy, true, and onely Sonne: The Holy-Ghost the Comfortour: Of Glory thou, oh Christ, are King; The Father's Sonne, for euermore; Who men from endlesse death to bring, The Virgins wombe didst not abhorre. 4 When Conquerour of Death thou wert, Heau'n to the Faithfull openedst thou; And in the Fathers glorie art At Gods right-hand enthroned now Whence wee beleeue, that thou shalt come; To iudge vs in the day of wrath. Oh, therefore helpe thy Seruants, whom Thy precious blood Redeemed hath. 5 Them with those Saints doe Thou record, That gaine eternall glory may. Thine Heritage, and People LORD, Saue, blesse, guide, and aduance for aye: By vs thou daily prais'd hast beene; And we will praise Thee without end. Oh, keepe vs, LORD, this day from sinne; And let thy Mercie vs defend. 6 Thy mercie, LORD, let vs receiue, As we our trust repose in thee: Oh LORD, in thee I trusted haue; Confounded neuer let me be. SONG XLIII. Athanasius Creed or Quicunque vult. Sing this as the third Song. [1] Those that will saued be, must hold, The true Catholike Faith, And keepe it wholly, if they would Escape eternall death. Which Faith a Trinitie adores In One; and One in Three: So, as the Substance being one, Distinct the Persons be. 2 One Person of the Father is, Another of the Sonne; Another of the Holy Ghost, And yet their Godhead one: Alike in glorie; and in their Eternitie as much: For, as the Father, both the Sonne, And Holy-Ghost is such. 3 The Father vncreate, and so The Sonne, and Spirit be: The Father he is Infinite; The other two as He. The Father an Eternall is, Eternall is the Sonne: So is the Holy Ghost; yet, these Eternally but One. 4 Nor say we there are Infinites, Or vncreated Three, For, there can but one Infinite, Or vncreated be. So Father, Sonne, and Holy-Ghost; All three Almighties are; And yet, not three Almighties tho, But onely One is there. 5 The Father likewise GOD and LORD: And GOD and LORD the Sonne; And GOD and LORD the Holy-Ghost, Yet GOD and LORD but One. For, though each Person by himselfe, We GOD and LORD confesse: Yet Christian Faith forbids that we Three GODS or LORDS professe. 6 The Father nor begot, nor made; Begot (not made) the Sonne; Made, nor begot the Holy-Ghost, But a Proceeding-One. One Father, not three Fathers then: One only Sonne, not three; One Holy Ghost we doe confesse, And that no moe they be. 7 And lesse, or greater then the rest, This Trinitie hath none; But they both Coeternall be, And equall eu'ry one. He therefore that will saued be, (As we haue said before) Must One in Three, and Three in One, Beleeue, and still adore. 8 That Iesus Christ incarnate was He must beleeue with this; And how that both the Sonne of GOD, And GOD and Man he is. GOD, of his Fathers substance pure; Begot ere Time was made; Man, of his Mothers substance borne, When Time his fulnesse had. 9 Both perfect GOD, and perfect Man, In Soule, and Flesh, as we: The Fathers equall, being God: As Man, beneath is He. Though God and Man; yet but one Christ: And to dispose it so, The Godhead was not turn'd to Flesh, But Manhood tooke thereto. 10 The Substance vnconfus'd; He one In Person doth subsist: As Soule and Body make one Man; So God and Man is Christ: Who suffred, and went downe to Hell, That we might saued be; The third day he arose againe, And Heau'n ascended he. 11 At God the Fathers right-hand, there He sits, and at the Doome, He to adiudge both quicke and dead, From thence againe shall come. Then all men with their Flesh shall rise, And he account require. Well doers into Blisse shall goe, The Bad to endlesse Fire. SONG. XLIIII. Veni Creator. [1] Come Holy-Ghost, the Maker, come; Take in the Soules of thine thy place: Thou whom our Hearts had being from, Oh, fill them with thy heauenly grace. Thou art that Comfort from aboue, The highest doth by gift impart; Thou spring of Life, a fire of Loue, And the annointing Spirit art: 2 Thou in thy Gifts art manifold, GODS right-hand Finger thou art, LORD: The Fathers promise made of old; Our tongues enriching by the Word. Oh! giue our blinded Sences Light; Shed Loue into ech heart of our, And grant the Bodies feeble plight, May be enabled by thy powre. 3 Farre from vs driue away the Foe, And let a speedy Peace ensue; Our Leader also be, that so We eu'ry danger may eschew. Let vs be taught the blessed Creede Of Father, and of Sonne, by Thee: And how from Both thou dost proceede, That our Beleefe it still may be. To Thee, the Father, and the Sonne; (Whom past and present times adore) The One in three, and Three in One, All glorie be for euermore. Here ends the first Part of the Hymnes and Songs of the Church.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE SECOND PART OF THE HYMNES and SONGS of the CHVRCH. SONG XLV. Aduent Sunday. Sing this as the ninth Song. 1 When Iesus Christ incarnate was. To be our Brother then came He: When into vs he comes by grace, Then his beloued Spouse are wee: When he from Heau'n descends agen, To be our Iudge returnes he then. 2 And then, despaire will those confound, That his first Commings nought regard; And those, who till the Trumpet sound, Consume their Leasures vnprepar'd: Curst be those pleasures, cry they may, Which droue the thought of this away. 3 The Iewes abiected yet remaine, That his first Aduent heeded not; And those fiue Virgins knockt in vaine, Who to prouide them Oyle forgot: But safe and blessed those men are, Who for his Commings doe prepare. 4 O let vs therefore watch and pray, His times of Visiting to know; And liue so furnisht, that we may, With him vnto his wedding goe: Yea, though at midnight he should call, Let vs be readie, Lampes, and all. 5 And so prouide before that Feast, Which Christ his comming next doth mind, That He to come and be a Guest Within our hearts may pleasure find: And we bid welcome with good cheare That Comming which so many feare. 6 Oh come, LORD Iesu, come away; (Yea, though the world it should deterre) Oh let thy Kingdome come we pray, Whose comming most too much deferre: And grant vs thereof such fore sight, It come not like a Theefe by night. SONG. XLVI. Christmas Day. 1 As on the night before this happie Morne, A blessed Angell vnto Shepheards told, Where (in a Stable) he was poorely borne, Whom, nor the earth, nor Heau'n of heau'ns can hold: Through Bethlem rung This newes at their returne; Yea, Angells sung, That God with vs was borne: And they made mirth because we should not mourne. CHORVS. Their Angell-Caroll sing we then, To God on high all glorie be, For Peace on earth bestoweth he, And sheweth fauour vnto men. 2 This fauour Christ vouchsafed for our sake, To buy vs Thrones, he in a Manger lay. Our Weakenesse tooke, that we his Strength might take, And was disrob'd, that he might vs aray; Our flesh he wore, Our Sinne to weare away. Our Curse he bore, That we escape it may. And Wept for vs, that we might sing for aye. CHORVS. With Angells therefore sing agen, To God on high all glorie be; For Peace on Earth bestoweth he; And sheweth fauour vnto men. SONG. XLVII. Another for Christmas day. A Song of Ioy vnto the Lord we sing, And publish forth the Fauours he hath showne: We sing his praise, from whom all Ioy doth spring, And tell abroad the wonders he hath done; For, such were neuer since the world begun. His loue therefore, oh let vs all confesse, And to the Sonnes of men his workes expresse. 2 As on this Day, the Sonne of God was borne: The blessed Word was then incarnate made; The Lord, to be a Seruant held no scorne; The Godhead was with humane nature clad; And Flesh, a Throne aboue all Angells had. His Loue therefore, oh let vs all confesse, And to the Sonnes of men his workes expresse. 3 Our Sinne and Sorrows on himselfe he tooke, On vs his blisse and goodnes to bestow. To visit Earth, he Heauen a while forsooke: And to aduance vs high, descended low; But with the sinfull Angells dealt not so. His Loue therefore, oh let vs all confesse, And to the Sonnes of men his workes expresse. 4 A Maid conceiu'd, whom Man had neuer knowne: The Fleece was moistned where no raine had beene: A Virgin she remaines, that had a Sonne; The Bush did flame that still remained greene; And this befell when God with vs was seene. His Loue therefore, oh let vs all confesse, And to the Sonnes of men his workes expresse. 5 For sinfull man all this to passe was brought, As long before the Prophets had forespoke: So, he that first our shame and ruine wrought, Once bruiz'd our heele, but now his head is broke; And he hath made vs whole, who gaue that stroke. His Loue therefore, oh let vs all confesse, And to the Sonnes of men his workes expresse. 5 The Lambe hath plaid deuouring Wolues among. The Morning starre of Iacob doth appeare. From Iesses Roote our Tree of Life is sprung, And all Gods words (in him) fulfilled are. Yet wee are slacke his praises to declare. His love therefore, oh let vs all confesse, And to the Sonnes of men his workes expresse. SONG. XLVIII. The Circumcision, or New-yeares Day. Sing this as the 44. Song. 1 This Day thy flesh, oh Christ, did bleed, Mark't by the Circumcision knife: Because the Law, for mans misdeed, Requir'd that Earnest of thy life. Those droppes deuin'd that showre of blood, Which in thine Agonie beganne: And that great showre foreshew'd the Flood, Which from thy Side the next day ranne. 2 Then, through that milder Sacrament, Succeeding this; thy Grace inspire; Yea, let thy smart make vs repent, And circumcized hearts desire. For, he that either is baptiz'd, Or Circumciz'd in flesh alone, Is but as an vncircumciz'd, Or as an vnbaptized-one. 3 The yeare anew we now begin, And outward gifts receiu'd haue we; Renue vs also, Lord, within, And make vs New-yeares-guifts for thee: Yea, let vs with the passed yeare, Our old affections cast away; That we new Creaturee may appeare, And, to redeeme the Time assay. SONG XLIX. Twelfe day, or the Epiphanie. Sing this as the 41 Song. [1] That so thy blessed birth, oh Christ, Might through the world be spread about, Thy Starre appeared in the East, Whereby the Gentiles found thee out; And offring Thee Mirrh, Incense, Gold, Thy threefold Office did vnfold. 2 Sweet Iesus, let that Starre of thine, Thy Grace, which guides to finde out thee, Within our hearts for euer shine, That thou of vs found out maist bee: And thou shalt be our King therefore, Our Priest, and Prophet euermore. 3 Teares that from true repentance drop, Instead of Mirrhe present will wee: For Incense, wee will offer vp Our Praiers and Praises vnto thee; And bring for Gold each pious deed, Which doth from sauing-faith proceed. 4 And as three Wisemen neuer went, To visit Herod any more: So, finding Thee, we will repent Our courses follow'd heretofore; And that we homeward may retire, The Way by Thee we will enquire. SONG LIII. Palme Sunday. Sing this as the third Song. 1 When Iesus to Ierusalem, (And there to suffer) rode; The people all the way for him, With Palme and Garments strow'd. And though he did full meekly ride, And poorely on an Asse; Hosanna to the King, they cride, As he along did passe. 2 His glorie, and his royall right (Eu'n by a power diuine) As if in worldly pomps despight, Through pouerty did shine: And though the greater sort did frowne, He exerciz'd his power, Till he himselfe did lay it downe, At his appointed houre. 3 Possession of his House he got; The Merchants thence expel'd; And, though the Priests were mad thereat, His Lectures there he held. Oh! how should any be so dull, To doubt who this might be! When they did things so wonderfull, And workes so mightie see. 4 Lord, when to vs thou drawest nigh, Instruct vs Thee to know; And to receiue Thee ioyfully, How meane so e're in show: Yea, though the rich, and Worldly wise, When we thy praises sing, Both Thee and vs, therefore, despise, Be thou approu'd our King. SONG. LV. Friday before Easter. Sing this as the 24 Song. [1] Yov that like heedlesse Strangers passe along, As if nought here concerned you to day; Draw nigh and heare the saddest Passion Song. That euer you did meet with in your way: So sad a Storie ne're was told before, Nor shall there be the like for euermore. 2 The greatest King that euer wore a Crowne, More then the basest Vassall was abus'd; The truest Louer that was euer knowne, By them he lou'd was most vnkindly vs'd: And he that liu'd from all transgressions cleare, Was plagu'd for all the sinnes that euer were. 3 Eu'n they, in pitty of whose fall he wept, Wrought for his ruine, whilst he sought their good; And watched for him when they should haue slept, That they might quench their malice in his blood: Yet (when their bonds fr? him he could haue thrown) To saue their liues, he daign'd to lose his owne. 4 Those, in whose hearts compassion should haue beene, Insulted o're his poore afflicted soule; And those that nothing ill in him had seene, (as guiltie) him accus'd of treason foule: Nay, him (that neuer had one idle thought) They, for blaspheming, vnto Iudgments brought. 5 Where some to aske him vaine demands begin, And some to make a sport with him deuise: Some, at his answers and behauiour grinne; And some doe spit their filth into his eies: Some giue him blows, some mocke, and some reuile; And he (Good heart) sits quiet all the while. 6 Oh, that where such a throng of men should be, No heart was found so gentle to relent! And that so good and meeke a Lambe as he, Should be so vs'd, and yet no teare be spent! Sure, when once malice fills the heart of man, Nor stone nor steele can be so hardned than. 7 For, after this, his cloaths from him they stript; And then, as if some Slaue this Lord had beene, With cruell Rods and Scourges him they whipt, Till wounds were ouer all his body seene: In purple clad, and crowned too with thorne They set him forth, and honourd him in scorne. 8 And when they saw him in so sad a plight, As might haue made a flintie heart to bleed, They not a whit recanted at the sight; But in their hellish fury did proceed: Away with him, away with him, they said, And Crucifie him, Crucifie him, cride. 9 A Crosse of Wood that huge and heauy was, Vpon his bloodie shoulders next they lay; Which onward to his Execution place, He carri'd, till he fainted in the way: And when he thither weake and tyred came, To giue him rest, they nail'd him to the same. 10 Oh! could we but the thousandth part relate, Of those Afflictions which they made him beare, Our hearts with passion would dissolue thereat, And we should sit and weepe for euer heare; Nor should we glad againe hereafter be, But that we hope in glory him to see. 11 For, while vpon the Crosse he pained hung, And was with soule-tormentings also grieu'd; (Farre more then can be told by any tongue, Or, in the hearts of mortalls be conceiu'd) Those, for whose sake he vnderwent such paine, Reioyc't thereat, and held him in disdaine. 12 One offer'd to him Vinegar and Gall; A second did his Pious Workes deride; To dicing for his Roabs did others fall; And many mock't him when to God he cride: Yet he, as they his paine still more procur'd, Still lou'd, and for their good the more endur'd. 13 But though his matchlesse Loue immortall were, It was a mortall Body he had on, That could no more then mortall Bodies beare; Their malice therefore did preuaile thereon: And loe, their vtmost furie hauing tri'de; This Lambe of God gaue vp the Ghost and di'de. 14 Whose Death, though cruell vnrelenting Man, Could view, without bewailing or affright; The Sunne grew darke, the Earth to quake began; The Temple Vaile did rend asunder quite: Yea, hardest Rocks therewith in pieces brake; And Graues did open, and the Dead awake. 15 Oh therefore, let vs all that present be, This Innocent, with mooued soules embrace: For, this was our Redeemer, this was hee, Who thus for our vnkindnesse vsed was; Eu'n Hee, the cursed Iewes and Pilate slew, Is He alone of whom all this is true. 16 Our sinnes of Spight, were part of those that day, Whose cruell Whips and Thornes did make him smart; Our Lusts were those that tir'd him in the Way; Our want of Loue was that which pierc't his Heart: And still when we forget, or sleight his paine, We crucifie and torture him againe. SONG. LVIII. Pentecost, or Whitsunday. Sing this as the third Song. [1] Exceeding faithfull in thy VVord, And iust in all thy waies, VVe doe acknowledge thee, oh LORD, And therefore giue thee praise: For, as thy promise thou didst passe, (before thou went'st away) Sent downe thy Holy-Spirit was At his appointed day. 2 VVhile thy Disciples in thy Name, Together did retire, The Holy-Ghost vpon them came, In Clouen Tongues of Fire, That in their calling they might be Confirmed from aboue, As thou wert when he came on thee, Descending like a Doue. 3 Whereby those men that simple were, And fearefull till that howre, Had knowledge at an instant there, And boldnesse arm'd with powre; Receiuing gifts so manifold, That (since the world begun) A wonder seldome hath beene told, that could exceed this one. 4 Now also, blessed Spirit, come; Vnto our Soules appeare: And of thy Graces showre thou some On this Assembly here: To vs thy Doue-like meekenesse lend, That humble we may be, And on thy siluer wings ascend, Our Sauiour Christ to see. 5 Oh, let thy Clouen-tongues, wee pray, So rest on vs agen, That both thy truth confesse we may, And teach it other men. Moreouer, let thy heauenly Fire (Enflamed from aboue) Burne vp in vs each vaine desire, And warme our hearts with loue. 6 Vouchsafe thou likewise to bestow On vs thy sacred Peace, We stronger may in vnion grow, And in debates decrease: Which peace, though many yet contemne, Reformed let them be, That we may (Lord) haue part in them, And they haue part in thee. SONG LIX. Trinity Sunday. Sing this as the ninth Song. [1] Those, oh, thrise holy Three in one, Who seeke thy Nature to explaine, By rules to humane Reason knowne, Shall find their Labour all in vaine; And in a Shell they may intend, The Sea as well to comprehend. 2 What therefore no man can conceiue, Let vs not curious be to know; But, when thou bid'st vs to beleeue, Let vs obey, let Reason goe: Faith's obiects true and surer be, Then those that Reasons eyes doe see. 3 Yet, as by looking on the Sunne, (Though to his substance we are blinde) And by the course we see him runne, Some Notions we of him may finde: So, what thy Brightnesse doth conceale, Thy Word, and Workes in part reueale. 4 Most glorious Essence, we confesse In Thee (whom by our faith we view) Three Persons, neither moe nor lesse, Whose workings them distinctly shew: And sure we are, those Persons Three Make but one GOD, and thou art Hee. 5 The Sunne a Motion hath we know, Which Motion doth beget vs Light; The Heat proceedeth from those two, And each doth proper acts delight: The Motion drawes out Time a Line, The Heat doth warme, the Light doth shine. 6 Yet, though this Motion, Light, &amp; Heate, Distinctly by themselues we take; Each in the other hath his seat, And but one Sunne we see they make: For, whatsoe're the One will doe, He workes it with the other two. 7 So, in the God-head there is knit A wondrous threefold True-loue-knot, And perfect Vnion fastens it, Though flesh and blood perceiue it not; And what each Person doth alone, By all the Trinitie is done. 8 Their Worke they ioyntly doe pursue, Though they their Offices diuide; And each one by himselfe hath due His proper Attributes beside: But one in Substance they are still In Vertue one, and one in Will. 9 Eternall all the Persons bee, And yet Eternall ther's but One; So likewise Infinite all three, Yet Infinite but One alone: And neither Person aught doth misse, That of the Godheads essence is. 10 In Vnitie and Trinitie Thus, oh Creator, we adore Thy euer-praised Deity, And thee confesse for euermore, One Father, one begotten Sonne, One Holy-Ghost, in Godhead one. SONG LX. Sunday in Generall. Sing this as the 44 Song. [1] Sixe daies, oh LORD, the world to make, And set all Creatures in aray, Was all the leasure thou would'st take, And then did'st rest the Seuenth day: That day thou therefore hallowed hast, And rightly by a Law Diuine; (Which till the end of time shall last) The seauenth part of time is thine. 2 Then, teach vs willingly to giue The tribute of our daies to Thee; By whom we now both moue, and liue, And haue attain'd to what we be. For, of that Rest, which by thy word Thou hast beene pleased to enioyne, The profit all is ours, oh LORD, And but the praise alone is thine. 3 Oh, therefore let vs not consent, To rob thee of thy Saboth day; Nor rest with carnall Rest content, But sanctifie it all wee may; Yea, grant that wee from sinfull strife, And all those Workes thou do'st detest, May keepe a Saboth all our life, And enter thy Eternall rest. SONG. LXI. S. Andrewes Day. Sing this as the 44 Song. [1] As blessed Andrew on a day, By fishing did his liuing earne, Christ came, and called him away, That he to fish for men might learne; And no delay the reat he made, Nor questions fram'd of his intent, But quite forsaking all he had, Along with him, that cal'd, he went. 2 Oh, that we could so readie be, To follow Christ when he doth call And that we could forsake, as he, Those Nets that we are snar'd withall. Or would this Fisherman of men, (Who set by all he had so light) By his obedience shewed then, (And his example) win vs might. 3 But Precepts and Examples faile, Till thou thy Grace, LORD, adde therto; Oh grant it, and we shall preuaile, In whatso'ere thou bid'st vs doe: Yea, we shall then that blisse conceiue, VVhich in thy seruice we may finde; And for thy sake be glad to leaue Our Nets, and all we haue behinde. SONG. LXII. S. Thomas Day. Sing this as the ninth Song. [1] When Christ was risen from the dead, And Thomas of the same was told, He would not credit it, he sed, Though he himselfe should him behold, Till he his wounded hands had eide, And thrust his fingers in his Side. 2 Which triall he did vndertake, And Christ his frailtie did permit, By his distrusting, sure to make Such others as might doubt of it: So we had right, and he no wrong; For, by his weakenes both are strong. 3 Oh blessed GOD, how wise thou art! And how confoundest thou thy Foes! Who their temptations dost conuart, To worke those ends which they oppose: When Satan seekes our faith to shake, The firmer he the same doth make. 4 Thus whatsoe're he tempts vs to, His disaduantage let it be; Yea, make those very sinnes we doe, The meanes to bring vs nearer thee: Yet, let vs not to ill consent, Though colour'd with a good intent. SONG LXIII. S. Stephens Day. Sing this as the 4. Song. [1] Lord, with what zeale did thy first Martyr breath Thy blessed truth to such as him withstood! With what stout mind embraced he his death! A holy witnesse sealing with his blood! The praise is thine, that him so strong did'st make And blest is he, that died for thy sake, 2 Vnquenched loue in him appear'd to be, When for his murth'rous Foes he did entreat: A piercing eie, made bright by Faith had he; For he beheld thee in thy Glorie set; And so vnmoou'd his patience he did keepe, Hee di'de, as if he had but falne asleepe. 3 Our luke-warme hearts with his hot Zealt enflame, So Constant, and so Louing let vs be; So let vs liuing glorifie thy Name; So let vs dying fixe our Eies on Thee: And when the sleepe of death shall vs o'retake, With him to Life eternall vs awake. SONG LXIV. S. Iohn the Euangelist Sing this as the 44 Song. [1] Teach vs by his example LORD, For whom we honour thee to Day, And grant, his witnesse of thy Word, Thy Church enlighten euer may: And as belou'd, oh Christ, he was, And therefore leaned on thy breast; So let vs also in thy Grace, And on thy Sacred bosome rest. 2 Into vs breath that Life Diuine, Whose Testimonie he intends; About vs cause thy Light to shine, That which no Darkenesse comprehends: And let thy euer-blessed Word, Which all things did create of nought, Anew create vs now, oh LORD, Whose ruine sin hath almost wrought. 3 Thy holy Faith we doe professe, Vs to thy Fellowship receiue; Our sinnes we heartily confesse, Thy pardon therefore let vs haue: And as to vs thy Seruant giues Occasion thus to honour Thee; So also, let our Words and Liues, As Lights and Guides to others be. SONG. LXV. Innocents Day. Sing this as the 44. Song. [1] That rage where of the Psalme doth say, Why are the Gentiles growne so mad? Appear'd in part vpon that day, When Herod slaine the Infants had; Yet (as it saith) they storm'd in vaine; (Though many Innocents they slew) For, Christ they purpos'd to haue slaine, Who all their Counsels ouerthrew. 2 Thus still vouchsafe thou to restraine All Tyrants, LORD, pursuing thee; Thus let our vast desires be slaine, That thou maist liuing in vs be: So, whil'st we shall enioy our breath, VVe of thy loue our Songs will frame; And with those Innocents, our death Shall also glorifie thy Name. 3 In Type those Many di'de for One; That One for many moe was slaine; And what they felt in Act alone, He did in VVill and Act sustaine. LORD grant, that what thou hast decreed In Will, and Act we may fulfill; And, though we reach not to the Deede, From vs, oh GOD, accept the VVill. SONG LXVI. The Conuersion of S. Paul. Sing this as the 44. Song. [1] A blest Conuersion, and a strange VVas that, when Saul a Paul became: And, LORD, for making such a change, VVe praise and glorifie thy Name. For, whilst he went from place to place, To persecute thy Truth and Thee; (And running to perdition was) By powrefull Grace cal'd backe was he. 2 VVhen from thy Truth we goe astray, (Or wrong it through our blinded zeale) Oh come, and stop vs in the way, And then thy VVill to vs reueale; That Brightnesse shew vs from aboue Which prooues the sensual eie-sight blind; And from our Eies those Scales remoue, That hinder vs the Way to finde. 3 And as thy blessed Seruant Paul, VVhen he a Conuert once became, Exceeded thy Apostles all. In painefull preaching of thy Name: So grant that those who haue in sinne Exceeded others heretofore, The start of them in Faith may winne, Loue, serue, and honour thee the more. SONG LXVII. Saint Matthias. [1] When one among the Twelue there was, That did Thy Grace abuse; Thou left'st him Lord, and in his place, did'st iust Matthias chuse: So, if a Traytour doe remaine VVithin thy Church to day, To grant him true Repentance daigne; Or cast him out, we pray. 2 Though horned like the Lambe he show, Or Sheepe-like clad he be, Let vs his Dragon language know, And Woluish nature see; Yea, cause the Lot to sall on those, The charge of thine to take, That shall their Actions well dispose, And conscience of them make. 3 Let vs moreouer minde his fall, VVhose roome Matthias got; So to belieue, and feare withall, That we forsake thee not: For, Titles, be they ne're so high, Or great, or Sacred Place, Can no mans Person sanctifie, VVithout thy speciall Grace. SONG. LXIX. Saint Philip and Iacob. Sing this as the third Song. [1] To thy Apostles thou hast taught, What they, oh Christ, should doe; And those things which beleeue they ought Of thee they learned too: And that which thou to th? hast showne, hath beene disposed thus; They vnto others made it knowne, And those haue told it vs. 2 With them we doe confesse, and say, (What shall not be denide) Thou art the Truth, the Life, the Way, And we in thee will bide: By thee, the Father we haue knowne, Whom thou descendest from; And vnto him, by thee alone, We haue our hope to come. 3 For, thou to Philip didst impart, (Which our beliefe shall be) That thou within the Father art, And that he is in Thee; And saidst, what euer in thy Name, We should with Faith require, Thou wouldst giue eare vnto the same, And grant vs our desire. 4 Of thee, oh LORD, we therefore craue, (Which thou wilt daigne, we know) The good Beliefe which now we haue, We neuer may forgoe; And that the Sacred Truth, which we Thy Word haue learned from, From Age to Age deriu'd may be, Vntill thy Kingdome come. SONG LXX. Saint Barnabas Day. Sing this as the 44 Song. [1] Thy gifts and graces manifold, To many men thou, LORD, hast lent, Both now, and in the daies of old, To teach them Faith, and to repent: Thy Prophets thou didst first ordaine, And they as Legats did appeare; Then cam'st thy Selfe, and in thy Traine Apostles for attendants were. 2 For Legier, when thou went'st away, The Holy-Ghost thou didst appoint; And here Successione till this day, Remaine of those he did annoint; Yea, thou hast likewise so ordain'd, That to make good what those haue taught, An Armie-Royall was maintain'd Of Martyres, who thy Battels fought. 3 For those, and Him, for whom we thus Are met, to praise thy Name to day, We giue thee thanks, as they for vs, That should come after them, did pray; And by this duty we declare, Our Faith assures, that they and we, (In Times diuided though we are) Haue one Communion still with Thee. SONG. LXXIII. Saint Iames his Day. Sing this as the 44 Song. [1] He that his Father had forsooke, And followed Christ at his commands, By humane frailtie ouertooke, For place and vaine preferment stands. Till by his Master he was taught, Of what he rather should haue care; How vndiscreetly he had sought, And what his Seruants honours are. 2 Whereby we finde how much adoe, The best men haue this world to leaue; How, when they wealth &amp; Friends forgoe, Ambitious aimes to them will cleaue: And sure this Angel-sin aspires, In such men chiefly to reside, That haue exilde those bruite desires, Which in the vulgar sort abide. 3 To thee, oh GOD, we therfore pray, Thy humble minde in vs may dwell; And charme that Fiend of Pride away, Which would thy Graces quite expell: But of all other, those men keepe, From this Delusion of the Foe, Who are the Shepheards of thy Sheepe, And should each good example show. 4 For, such as still pursuing be That greatnes, Which the world respects, Their seruile basenesse neither see, Nor feele thy Spirits rare effects: And doubtlesse, they, who most of all Descend to serue both Thee, and thine, Are those, who in thy Kingdome shall In Seates of greatest glorie shine, SONG. LXXV. Saint Mathew. Sing this as the 44 Song. [1] Why should vnchristian censures passe On men, or that which they professe A Publican S. Mathew was, Yet GOD'S beloued ne're-the-lesse, And was elected one of Christs Apostles, and Euangelists. 2 For, GOD doth not a whit respect, Possession, Person, or Degree; But maketh choice of his Elect, From euerie sort of men that be, That none might of his loue despare, But all men vnto him repaire. 3 For those, oh let vs therefore pray, Who seeme vncalled to remaine; Not shunning them as cast away, GOD'S fauour neuer to obtaine: For some a while neglected are, To stirre in vs more louing care. 4 And for our selues, let vs desire, That we our Auarice may shun, When GOD our seruice shall require, As this Euangelist hath done, And spend the remnant of our daies, In setting forth our Makers praise. SONG. LXXX. Rogation Weeke. Sing this as the 44. Song. [1] It was thy pleasure, LORD, to say, That whatsoeuer in thy Name We prai'd for, as we ought to pray, Thou would'st vouchsafe to grant the same. Oh, therefore we beseech Thee now, To these our praiers which we make, Thy gracious care in fauour bowe, And grant them for thy mercies sake. 2 Let not the Seasons of this Yeare, (As they their courses doe obserue) Engender those Contagions here, Which our transgressions doe deserue: Let not the Summer Wormes impaire Those bloomings of the Earth, we see; Nor Blastings, or distemper'd Ayre Destroy those Fruites that hopefull be. 3 Domesticke brawles expell thou farre, And be thou pleas'd our Coast to guard, The dreadfull sounds of in-brought War, Within our Confines be not heard: Continue also here thy Word, And make vs thankefull (we Thee pray) The Pestilence, Dearth, and the Sword Haue beene so long with-held away. 4 And, as we heedfully obserue The certaine limits of our Grounds, And outward quiet to preserue, About them walke our yeerely Rounds: So, let vs also haue a care, Our Soules possessions, LORD, to know, That no encroachments on vs there, Be gained by our subtill Foe. 5 What pleasant Groues, what goodly Fields! How fruitfull Hils and Dales haue we! How sweet an Ayre our Climate yeelds! How stor'd with Flockes, &amp; Heards are we! How Milke and Honey doth or'eflow! How cleare &amp; wholsome are our Springs! How safe from rauenous Beasts we goe! And, oh how free from Poysnous things! 6 For these, &amp; for our Grasse, our Corne; For all that springs from Blade or Bough; For all those blessings that adorne Or Wood or Field this Kingdome through: For all of these, thy praise we sing, And humbly (LORD) entreat thee too, That Fruit to thee we forth may bring, As vnto Vs thy Creatures doe: 7 So, in the sweete refreshing shade, Of thy Protection sitting downe, Those gracious Fauours wee haue had, Relate we will to thy renowne; Yea, other men, when we are gone, Shall for thy Mercies honour Thee, And famous make what thou hast done, To such as after them shall be. SONG. LXXXIII. For the Communion. Sing this as the third Song. [1] That Fauour, LORD, which of thy Grace Wee doe receiue to day, Is greater then our Merit was, And more then praise we may: For, of all things that can be told, That which least comfort hath Is more, then e're deserue we could, Except it were thy Wrath. 2 Yet we, not onely haue obtain'd This worlds best gifts of Thee; But thou thy Flesh hast also daign'd, Our Food of Life to be: For which, since vvee no mendes can make, (And thou requir'st no more) The Cup of sauing health we take, And praise thy Name therefore. 3 Oh, teach vs rightly to receiue, What thou dost here bestow: And learne vs truly to conceiue, What we are bound to know; That such as cannot wade the deepe Of thy vnfathom'd Word, May by thy Grace, safe courses keepe Along the shallow Ford. 4 This Mysterie, we must confesse, Our reach doth far exceed; And some of our weake Faiths are lesse Then Graines of Mustard Seede: Oh therefore, LORD, encrease it so, VVe Fruit may beare to Thee, And that Implicit Faith may grow, Explicit Faith to be. 5 With hands we see not as with Eies, Eyes thinke not as the Heart; But each retaines what doth suffize, To act his proper part: And in the Body while it bides, The meanest Member shares That blisse, which to the best betides, And as the same it fares: 6 So, if in Vnion vnto Thee, Vnited we remaine, The Faith of those that stronger be, The weaker shall sustaine: Our Christian Loue shall that supplie, Which we in Knowledge misse, And humble thoughts shall mount vs hie Eu'n to Eternall blisse. 7 Oh pardon all those hainous Crimes, Whereof we guiltie are; To serue thee more in future times, Our hearts doe thou prepare; And make thou gracious in thy sight, Both Vs, and this we doe, That thou therein maist take delight, And we haue loue thereto. 8 No new Oblation we deuise, For sins prefer'd to be; Propitiatorie Sacrifice Was made at full by Thee: The Sacrifice of Thankes is that, And all that thou dost craue; And wee our selues are part of what VVe sacrificed haue. 9 VVe doe no grosse Realities Of Flesh in this conceiue; Or that their proper qualities, The Bread or Wine doe leaue: Yet in this holy Eucharist, VVe (by a meanes Diuine) Know we are fed with thee, oh Christ, Receiuing Bread and Wine. 10 And though the outward Elements, For signes acknowledg'd be, VVe cannot say thy Sacraments, Things onely signall be: Because, who e're thereof partakes, In those this powre it hath; It either them thy Members makes, Or Slaues of Sinne and Death. 11 Nor vnto those doe we encline, (But from them are estrang'd) Who yeeld the forme of Bread and Wine, Yet thinke the Substance chang'd: For we beleeue each Element Is what it seemes indeed, Although that in thy Sacrament, There with on Thee we feede. 12 Thy Reall Presence we auow, And know it so Diuine That carnall Reason knowes not how. That Presence to define: For, when thy Flesh we feede on thus, (Though strange it do appeare) Both We in Thee, and Thou in Vs, Eu'n at one instant are. 13 No maruaile many troubled were, This Secret to vnfold; For, Mysteries Faiths Obiects are, Not things at pleasure told. And he that would by Reason sound, What Faiths deepe reach conceiues, May both himselfe and them confound, To whom his rules he leaues. 14 Let vs therefore our Faith erect, On what thy Word doth say, And hold their knowledge in suspect, That new foundations lay: For, such full many a grieuous Rent Within thy Church haue left; And by thy peacefull Sacrament, The VVorld of Peace bereft. 15 Yea, what thy pledge and seale of Loue VVas first ordain'd to be, Doth great and hate full Quarrels moue, VVhere wrangling Spirits be: And many men haue lost their blood, (VVho did thy Name professe) Because they hardly vnderstood, VVhat others would expresse. 16 Oh, let vs not hereafter so, About meere Words contend, The while our craftie common Foe, Procures on vs his end. But if in Essence we agree, Let all with Loue assay, A helpe vnto the VVeake to be, And for each other pray. 17 Loue, is that blessed Cymment, LORD, VVhich must vs re-vnite; In bitter speeches, fire, and sword, It neuer tooke delight: The VVeapons those of Malice are, And they themselues beguile: VVho dreame that such ordained were Thy Church to reconcile. 18 Loue brought vs hither, and that Loue perswades vs to implore, That thou all Christian hearts wouldst moue, To seeke it more and more; And that Selfe-will no more bewitch Our minds with foule debate; Nor fill vs with that malice, which Disturbes a quiet state: 19 But this especially we craue, That perfect Peace may be Mong those that disagreed haue, In show of Loue to Thee; That they with Vs, and we with Them, May Christian Peace retaine, And both in New Ierusalem VVith Thee for euer raigne. 20 No longer let Ambitious Ends, Blinde Zeale, or cankered Spight, Those Churches keepe from being Friends, Whom Loue should fast vnite: But let thy glory shine among Those Candlestickes, we pray, Wee may behold what hath so long Exil'd thy Peace away: 21 That those, who (heeding not thy Word) Expect an Earthly Powre, And vainely thinke some Temp'rall Sword Shall Antichrist deuoure; That those may know, thy Weapons are No such, as they doe faigne, And that it is no Carnall warre, Which we must entertaine. 22 Confessors, Martyres, Preachers strike The Blowes that gaine this Field: Thankes, Prayre, Instructions, and the like, Those Weapons are they weild: Long suffring, Patience, Prudent-care, Must be the Court-of-Guard; And Faith and Innocencie, are Instead of Wals prepar'd. 23 For these (no question) may as well Great Babel ouerthrow, As Ierichoes large Bulwarkes fell, When men did Rams hornes blow: Which could we credit, we should cease All bloody Plots to lay, And to suppose, Gods holy Peace Should come the Deuils way. 24 LORD, let that Flesh, and Blood of thine, Which fed vs hath to Day, Our hearts to thy True-loue encline, And driue ill thoughts away: Let vs remember what thou hast For our meere loue endur'd; Eu'n, when of vs despis'd thou wast, And we thy death procur'd: 25 And with each other, for thy sake, So truly let vs beare, Our patience may vs dearer make, When reconcil'd we are: So, when our courses finish'd be, VVe shall ascend aboue Sunne, Moone, and Stars, to liue with Thee, that art the God of Loue. These that follow are Thankesgiuings for publike Benefits. SONG. LXXXV. For seasonable Weather. Sing this as the third Song. [1] LORD, should the Sun, the Cloudes, the Winde, The Ayre and Seasons be To vs so froward, and vnkinde, As we are false to Thee; All Fruits would quite away be burn'd, Or lye in VVater drown'd, Or blasted be, or ouerturn'd, Or chilled on the ground. 2 But, from our duty though we swarue, Thou still dost mercy show, And daigne thy Creatures to preserue, That men might thankfull grow; Yea, though from day to day we sinne, And thy displeasure gaine, No sooner we to cry begin, But pittie we obtaine. 3 The Weather now thou changed hast, That put vs late to feare, And when our hopes were almost past, Then comfort did appeare The heau'n the earths complaints hath heard, They reconciled be; And thou such weather hast prepar'd, As wee desir'd of Thee. 4 For which with lifted hands and eies, To thee we doe repay The due and willing Sacrifize Of giuing Thankes to day; Because, such Offrings we should not To render Thee be slow; Nor let that mercy be forgot VVhich thou art pleas'd to show. SONG LXXXVIII. For Victorie. Sing this as the 44. Song. [1] We loue thee, LORD, we praise thy Name Who by thy great Almightie arme, Hast kept vs from the spoile and shame Of those that sought our causlesse harme. Thou art our Life, our Triumph-Song, The Ioy and Comfort of our heart; To Thee all praises doe belong, And thou the LORD of Armies art. 2 VVe must confesse it is thy powre, That made vs Masters of the Field; Thou art our Bulwarke, and our Towre, Our Rocke of refuge, and our Shield. Thou taught'st our hands and armes to fight VVith vigor thou did'st gird vs round; Thou mad'st our Foes to take their flight, And thou did'st beat them to the ground. 3 With fury came our armed Foes, To blood and slaughter fiercely bent, And perils round did vs inclose, By whatsoeuer way we went; That had'st not thou our Captaine beene, (To lead vs on, and off againe) VVe on the place had dead bin seene. Or mask'd in blood and wounds had laine. 4 This Song we therefore sing to Thee, And pray, that thou for euermore VVould'st our Protector daigne to be, As at this time, and heretofore; That thy continuall fauour showne, May cause vs more to Thee encline, And make it through the World be knowne That such as are our Foes, are thine. SONG. LXXXIX. For deliuerance from a publike Sicknesse. Sing this as the ninth Song. [1] When thou wouldst, LORD, afflict a Land Or scourge thy People that offend, To put in practice thy Command, Thy creatures all on Thee attend; And thou, to execute thy Word, Hast Famine, Sicknesse, Fire, and Sword. 2 And here among vs for our sin, A sore Disease hath lately raign'd, VVhose fury so vnstai'd hath bin, It could by nothing be restrain'd; But ouerthrew both weake and strong. And tooke away both old and young. 3 To Thee our cries we therefore sent, Thy wonted pittie, LORD, to proue; Our wicked waies we did repent, Thy Visitation to remoue; And thou thine Angel didst command, To stay his wrath-inflicting hand. 4 For which thy loue, in thankefull wise, Both hearts and hands to thee we raise, And in the stead of former cries, Do sing thee now a Song of Praise; By whom the fauour yet we haue, To scape the neuer-filled Graue. SONG XC. For the KINGS Day. Sing this as the third Song. [1] When, LORD, we call to minde those things That should be sought of Thee, Remembring that the hearts of Kings At thy disposing be; And how of all those blessings, which Are outwardly possest: To make a Kingdome safe and rich, Good Princes are the best. 2 We thus are mou'd to sing thy praise, For Him thou daigned hast, And humbly beg, that all our daies Thy care of vs may last. Oh, blesse our King, and let him raigne, In peacefull safety long, The Faiths Defender to remaine, And shield the Truth from wrong. 3 With awfull Loue, and louing Dread, Let vs obserue him, LORD, And as the Members with their Head, In Christian peace accord: And fill him with such royall care, To cherish vs for this; As if his heart did feele we are Some liuing parts of his. 4 Let neither Partie Struggle from That duty should be showne, Lest each to other plagues become, And both be ouerthrowne: For, o're a disobedient Land, Thou dost a Tirant set; And those that Tyrant-like command, Haue still with Rebels met. 5 Oh, neuer let so sad a doome Vpon these Kingdomes fall; And to assure it may not come, Our sinnes forgiue vs all: Yea; let the Parties innocent Some dammage rather share, Then, by vnchristian discontent, A double Curse to beare. 6 Make vs (that placed are below, Our callings to apply) Not ouer curious be to know, What he intends on high. But, teach him iustly to command, Vs rightly to obey; So, both shall safe together stand, And doubts shall flie away. 7 When hearts of Kings we pry into, Our owne we doe beguile; And what we ought our selues to doe, We leaue vndone the while: Whereas, if each one would attend The way he hath to liue, And all the rest to Thee commend, Then all should better thriue. 8 Oh, make vs, LORD, disposed thus, And our dread Soueraigne saue; Blesse vs in him, and him in vs, We both may blessings haue; That many yeares for him we may This Song deuoutly sing, And marke it for a happy day, When he became our KING. Here endeth the HYMNES and SONGS of the Chvrch.</field>
