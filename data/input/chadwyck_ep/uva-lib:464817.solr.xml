      <field name="fulltext">The Song of Solomon. CHAP. I. 1. The Song of Songs, which is Solomons. 2. The kisses of his gracious mouth, O let him grant to me; For why? thy love I do account good, better then wine to be. 3. Through savor of thine oyntments even so thy name doth prove As oyntment poured out, therefore the Virgins do thee love. 4. O draw thou me, and after thee then will we run apace; Into his Chambers did the King conduct me, through his grace. We will be glad, and joy in thee; remembring more then wine Thy love: and as for Upright ones, their love is surely thine. 5. O Daughters of Jerusalem, though black, yet am I fair, And comly; like as Kedar Tents, and Solomon's Curtains are. 6. Look not on me, because in state of blackness ye me see; Because the sun with scortching heat hath looked upon me. My mothers children angry were, and on me they did frown; A Vineyard-keeper they me made: I did not keep mine own. 7. O thou whom with my soul I love, do thou to me make known Where thou dost feed, and make thy flocks to rest themselvs at noon. Alas my love, why should I be as one that turns aside By flocks of thy companions, and so with them abide? 8. If thou know'st not (O fairest one) by steps of flocks make speed; Beside the shepherds tents, thy kids thou maist with safety feed. 9. O thou on whom my love is set, I have compared thee To company of horses which in Pharaoh's Charets be. 10. Thy cheeks do beautiful appear, with rows of jewels set; With chains of finest gold also full comly is thy neck. 11. We wil prepare for thee (who dost so beautiful appear) Borders of gold, and silver studs, which shall be for thy wear. 12. While that the King in royal state doth at his Table sit; Then doth my Spikenard send abroad the smell thereof full sweet. 13. A bundle of refreshing myrrhe is my Belov'd to me; And even so between my brests lie all the night shall he. 14. My wel-beloved is to me even such as now I show, As Camphire clusters, which within Engedi's vinyards grow. 15. Behold my love, for thou art fair, lo thou (my love) art fair: Thy beauty in thine eyes appears, yea like Doves eyes they are. 16. Behold (beloved) thou art fair, so do I thee esteem; Yea very pleasant for delight, also our bed is green. 17. Our house, yea ours, not mine alone with Cedar beams is staid, The rafters also which it hath, even they of Fir are made. CHAP. II. 1. I am the fair and pleasant Rose, in Sharon fields I grow: Yea I likewise the Lilly am of Valleys, that are low. 2. As is the Lilly, when among the thorns it doth appear; Among the daughters so is she that is my love, my dear. 3. As Apple-tree among the trees that in the wood have place, So is my love among the sons, excelling them in grace. Under his shade with great delight I sate, and was refresht: His fruit likewise I found to be most sweet unto my taste. 4. Unto the house of Banquetting he did me also lead; And there the banner of his love he over me did spread. 5. O stay me now with Flagons, and with Apples comfort me; For I am sick, yea sick of love I finde my self to be. 6. His left hand (my beloved one) under my head hath plac't; And by his right hand I am now most lovingly embrac't. 7. O Daughters of Jerusalem, I give you this in charge: Even by the Roes, and by the Hindes, of fields that are so large: That ye take heed ye stir not up my love, who takes his ease; And that you do not him awake until himself shall please. 8. The voice of my beloved, lo upon the mountains he Comes leaping, and upon the hills comes skipping towards me. 9. Like Roe, or Hart, behold my love behind our wall doth stand: He looks through window, shews himself through lattess neer at hand. 10. And my beloved thus did speak, to me thus did he say; Thou that my love, and fair one art, arise, and come away. 11. For why? behold the winter time is gone and over-past; The rain likewise which did descend, is ceas'd, and doth not last. 12. The flowers appear upon the earth the birds do sing with chear; Their time is come: within our land the Turtle's voice we hear. 13. The Fig-tree yeilds green figs, the Vines which tender grapes do bear, Do give good smell; arise my love, and come away, my fair. 14. O thou (my dove) that in the rock and clefts thereof dost bide Thou that in secret places of the stayrs, thy self dost hide. Thy countenance let me behold; thy voice eke let me hear: For sweet and pleasant is thy voice, thy countenance is clear. 15. Take us the Foxes, yea, I say, the little Foxes take; For that our vines have tender grapes whereof a spoyl they make. 16. My wel-beloved he is mine, and I likewise am his: The place where he doth please to feed, among the Lillies is. 17. Until the day do break, and till shaddows away do fly; Turn love, and be like Roe or Hart, on Bether mountains high. CHAP. III. 1. By night on bed I sought my love, whom I do chiefly mind; Him did I seek, and yet, alas! I sought, but did not finde. 2. Now will I rise, and round about the City will I go: In streets, and in the broadest waies, there I my self will show. Him will I seek, whom with my soul I love; he is my dear: I sought, and when I had so done, yet did he not appear. 3. The City Watchmen did me find, of them I did enquire, If they had seen, or could inform of my beloved dear. 4. It was a very little that from watchmen I was past; But him I found my soul so loves, and then I held him fast, And would not let him go, until I brought him for to see My Mothers house, and chambers where she had conceived me. 5. O daughters of Jerusalem, I give you this in charge; Even by the Roes, and by the Hinds of fields, that are so large; That ye take heed ye stir not up my love, who takes his ease: And that you do not him awake until himself shall please. 6. But who is this that cometh out from wilderness afar, Appearing like to pillars, that of smoak composed are; Sweetly perfum'd with costly myrrhe with frankincense likewise, And all the Powders Merchant men do make their merchandise? 7. Behold his bed which Sol'mons is threescore that are both stout And valiant men of Israel, do stand it round about. 8. They all hold swords, being skild in war, and ev'ry man of might With sword upon his thigh, because of terror in the night. 9. A Princely Chariot was prepar'd by Solomon the King: Made of the wood that in the mount of Lebanon doth spring. 10. The pillars which he made thereto, of silver pure they were; The bottom also which it had was made of gold most clear: Of costly purple eke there was a covering made above For daughters of Jerusalem, paved in midst with love. 11. O ye that Sions daughters are, do ye go forth and see King Solomon, who with his crown which appears in dignity. Crowned I say with Crown, the he from his mother had In day of spousals, and the day wherein his heart was glad. CHAP. IV. 1. Behold my love, for thou art fair, lo thou art fair, my dear; Thou hast also Doves eyes, which do within thy locks appear. Like to a flock of goats, which do on Gilead mountain feed, And thence appear, so is the hair which is upon thy head. 2. Thy teeth likewise within thy mouth they also do appear Like flock of sheep that's even shorn, being washed, and made clear. All which are fruitful and no less then twins they bear each one; Among them all a barren sheep cannot be found, not one. 3. Thy lips like scarlet thred, thy speech from thee doth comly flow, Thy temples in thy locks, like to piece of Pomgranate show. 4. Thy neck is like an Armory, such as was David's Tower; A thousand Bucklers hang thereon, all shields of men of power. 5. Thy brests, even both, to two young Roes I have compar'd indeed; Which are both twins, and likewise do among the lillies feed. 6. Until the breaking of the day, and shaddows get them hence; I'le get me to the mounts of Myrrhe, and hill of Frankincense. 7. I said before of thee my love, and so I say again; Thou art all fair, and not a spot there doth in thee remain 8. Come thou with me from Lebanon from Lebanon with me My spouse: from top of Amana look with thine eyes and see. Yea from the top of Shenir look, and Hermon hill likewise; From Lions dens, and eke the mount of Leopards, cast thine eyes. 9. My Sister, thou hast ravished my heart; my spouse most dear: Yea, with one ey; one chain that doth about thy neck appear. 10. How fair, my sister, is thy love? my spouse, how fair to me? Yea, how much better is thy love, then any wine can be? And how much better is the smell (my spouse) which doth arise Out of thine ointments, then the smel of any kinde of spice? 11. O thou my spouse, thy lips drop down as honey comb apace: Honey and milk under thy tongue are found to have their place. The smelling of the garments eke the which thou puttest on, May well for sweetness be compar'd to smell of Lebanon. 12. A garden that enclosed is, so is my sister dear; My spouse a spring shut up and seal'd even as a fountain clear. 13. An Orchard of Pomgranates are the plants in thee that grow; Camphire, with spikenard, which are sweet are fruits that from thee flow. 14. Spikenard, and Saffron, Calamus, and Cinamon likewise; All trees of Frankincense and myrrh, Aloes, and all chief spice. 15. A fountain eke of gardens, and a well of waters clear; Yea living streams also that do from Lebanon appear. 16. Awake O north wind, come thou south upon my garden blow; That by this means the spices which it beareth, out may flow. And now let my beloved come into his garden fair, And eat his fruits, yea such as to his taste most pleasant are. CHAP. V. 1. Into my garden am I come my sister, spouse most dear; And gathered the myrrhe, and spice which it to me doth bear. Eaten I have my honey combe, and honey with delight: Yea drunk my wine, and eke my milk sith thou didst me invite. And now (O friends) that I have eat and likewise drunk, eat ye, And drink, yea drink abundantly, ye are belov'd of me. 2. I sleep, but yet my heart doth wake, the voice which now I hear Is my Beloved's, yea he knocks who is to me most dear. Open to me (saith he) thou art my sister, and my love; Thou art my undefiled one, thou art likewise my dove. And why? for fill'd I am with dew that on my head doth light; My locks also bedewed are with droppings of the night. 3. My coat is off, (said I) how shall I put it on again? My feet also which washed are, how shall I foul and stain? 4. Yet my beloved did put in his hand by hole of dore; My bowels then for him did move, yea they were troubled sore. 5. I rose to open to my love, with myrrhe my hands did drop, My fingers with sweet smelling myrrh on handles of the lock. 6. To my beloved then I did open without delay; But my beloved had withdrawn, yea he was gone away. My soul in me began to fail when my beloved spake; I sought, but could not find; I call'd, he would no answer make. 7. The City watchmen found me, and they smote me; yea also Did wound me: they that keep the walls my vail they took me fro. 8. O daughters of Jerusalem, this charge receive from me; Tell my beloved, I am sick of love, if ye him see. 9. This thy beloved, what is he? to us do thou declare, Thou fairest one; what is he more then other loveds are? Yea what is thy beloved more (do thou declare to us) Then other well-beloveds are, that thus thou chargest us? 10. My well-beloved, he is white, and ruddy is also; Compare him with ten thousand more the chiefest he will show. 11. Yea like unto the finest gold so doth his head appear, Bushy, and black as Ravens, be the locks which he doth wear. 12. His eyes are like the eyes of doves which are by waters fair; Yea such as washed are with milk, most fitly set they are. 13. As bed of spices, as sweet flowers, so doth his cheeks appear, His lips also like lillies are, dropping sweet smelling myrrh. 14. His hands are like to rings of gold which are with Beril made; His belly as bright Ivory, with Saphires underlaid. 15. His leggs like unto pillars are which are of marble made, Set upon sockets of fine gold, and so well underlaid. His countenance like Lebanon excels, as Cedars tall. 16. His mouth likewise it is most sweet yea he is lovely all. Even such is my beloved one, such is my friend most dear; O daughters of Jerusalem, of whom I now enquire. CHAP. VI. 1. This well-beloved that is thine, O whither is he gone? Thou that of women dost appear to be the fairest one: Yea whither is he turn'd aside, that is thus lov'd of thee? Tell us and as thou dost him seek, so seek for him will we. 2. Gone to his garden, and the beds of spices, is my dear; To feed in gardens, and withal to gather lillies there. 3. My well-beloved he is mine, and I likewise am his; The place where he doth please to feed, among the lillies is. 4. As Tirza and Jerusalem, so thou my love art fair And beautiful, yea terrible as Troops that Banners bear. 5. Turn thou thine eyes from me, for I am overcome thereby; Thy hair is as a flock of goats that come from Gilead high. 6. Thy teeth likewise within thy mouth they also do appear Even like unto a flock of sheep, being washed and made clear. All which are fruitful, and no less then twins they bear each one: Among them all a barren sheep cannot be found, not one. 7. Yea even like unto a piece of a Pomgranate, are The temples of thy head, which do within thy locks appear. 8. There are for number threescore queens with them there are no less Then fourscore concubines, besides the virgins numberless. 9. My dove, my undefil'd is one, she is the only dear Her mother hath, the choice she is of her that did her bear. The daughters when they had her seen did bless her, yea also The queens, and concubines, and they her praise abroad did show. 10. But who is she that morning like looks forth? and doth appear For fairness, like unto the moon, and as the sun, is clear. Yea likewise terrible she is, and greatly to be dread, As is an Army ord'red out, and hath its Banners spread. 11. Into the garden I went down of Nuts, that I might know, And see what fruit was to be found in vallies that are low. Yea likewise I went down to see whether the vine did spring And flourish where they grew &amp; eke Pomgranates buds did bring. 12. Then on a sudden, and before that I was well aware, My soul made me like chariots of Aminadib that are. 13. Return, O Shulamite, return; return again, I say; Do thou O Shulamite return, that look on thee we may. What will ye see in Shulamite, so called as ye hear? As Armies two in company, even so she doth appear. CHAP. VII. 1. O thou that Princes daughter art how beautiful to see Are even both thy feet, with shooes, the which upon them be? The joints likewise even of thy thighs which are like to jewels rare; The work of cunning workman his hand doth well prepare. 2. Thy Navel like round goblet is, wherein liquor is found; Thy Belly like an heap of wheat beset with lillies round. 3. And as for thy two Brests likewise I do them both compare To Roes that are both young, and twins, they very even are. 4. Like to a Tower of Ivory, so is thy neck for state: Like Heshbons fish-pools are thine eyes neer to Bath-rabbim gate. Thy Nose also is like unto the Tower that hath place Upon the mount of Lebanon, and doth Damascus face. 5. Thine head on thee like Carmel is the hair upon thine head Like purple is, in Galleries the king is held and staid. 6. How fair art thou? How pleasant eke dost thou to me appear? Even for delights, O thou that art my love, my only dear. 7. This stature w?? thou hast attain'd, doth like a Palm-tree show; Thy Brests like clusters of fine grapes which on the Vine do grow. 8. Then did I say that now I will unto the Palm-tree go, And will take hold upon the boughs that thereupon do grow: And now like clusters of the Vine, even so thy Brests shall be, And eke the smelling of thy Nose, like Apples of the tree. 9. The roof and Palate of thy mouth that also shall appear Even like unto the choycest wine, for my beloved dear. Such wine (I say) as goeth down most sweetly, and doth make And cause the lips of them that are asleep, to move and speak. 10. I am my well-beloveds, and to me a right hath he; And as for his desire, even that is also towards me. 11. Come my beloved, let us go into the fields abroad: Yea let us lodge in Villages, and there make our aboad. 12. Up to the Vinyards let us go early, that we may see If that the Vine do flourish, and if tender grape there be. Pomgranates also, whether they their buds put forth and show; And there will I give out my loves, and them on thee bestow. 13. The mandrakes smell, and at our gates all pleasant fruits there be, Both new and old, which (O my love) I have laid up for thee. CHAP. VIII. 1. O that thou wert to me as he that is my brother near; As he that sucked hath the breasts even of my Mother dear: And when I should thee find without thou should'st be entertain'd With kisses, yet I should not be despised, or disdain'd. 2. Then would I lead thee lovingly, and likewise thee conduct Unto my Mothers dwelling, who would duely me instruct: Yea, I would cause thee for to drink within my Mothers house Of wine that is well spiced, and of my Pomegranate juyce. 3. Under my head his left hand should be laid, and there have place; And with his right hand eke he should me tenderly embrace. 4. O Daughters of Jerusalem, my love now takes his ease; I charge you that you stir not up, nor wake him till he please. 5. But who is this from wilderness, that doth depart away, Leaning on her beloved one, and doth upon him stay? Under the Apple-tree I did thee raise, and also there Thy mother brought thee forth, yea brought thee forth that did thee bear. 6. Upon thine heart let me be put, and set like as a seal; And as a seal upon thine arme, thus do thou with me deal; For love is strong as death, as grave, cruel as jealousie. The coals thereof are coals of fire, which flame most vehemently. 7. By many waters love cannot be quenched, and likewise It cannot drowned be by flouds, though they against it rise. Although a man would give for love (that so it might be gain'd) Even all the substance of his house, yet would it be disdain'd. 8. Our little sister hath no brests, what shall for her be done In day she shall be spoken for, and into mention come. 9. A silver palace we will build, if so a wall she be; And if a dore, with Cedar boards enclosed shall she be. 10. I am a wall, and eke my brests like unto Towers arise; And then as one that favour found, so was I in his eyes. 11. A Vinyard was in Baal-Haman, which Sol'mon did possess; The Vinyard he to keepers let, that they the same might dress: A thousand pieces of silver, each of those keepers were To bring, which did the vinyard keep for fruit which it did bear. 12. My Vinyard which is mine, and w?? I chalenge as my right; Before my face it doth appear, I keep it in my sight. A thousand thou O Solomon must have, as due to thee; To them that keep the fruit thereof, two hundred there shall be. 13. O thou that in the gardens hast thy dwelling, they that be Companions, hearken to thy voice; to hear it cause thou me. 14. Make haste O my beloved one, and be thou like a Roe, Or a young Hart, which is upon the mount where spices grow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The SONG of MOSES. Exodus xv. 1. Unto the Lord I will sing praise, for he hath gloriously Tryumph'd, the Horse and Rider he hath thrown into the sea. 2. Jehovah is my strength and song, yea my salvation; My God, for him I will prepare an habitation. My fathers God, him will I then exalt and spread his fame: 3. Jehovah is a man of war, Jehovah is his name. 4. He Pharaoh's chariots, and his host, into the sea hath thrown; His chosen captains he likewise in the red sea did drown. 5. The depths below have cov'red them yea they did sink each one Into the bottom of the sea, even like unto a stone. 6. Thy right hand Lord it is become glorious in power, yea lo Thy right hand (Lord) to pieces hath dash'd and destroy'd thy foe. 7. In thine excelling greatness thou hast vanquish'd them that rose Against thee yea thy wrath consum'd (as stubble) hath thy foes. 8. And by the breath and blast which was out of thy Nostrils sent, The waters which divided were, again together went. The floods likewise did stand upright and as an heap appear: And in the heart even of the sea, the depths congealed were. 9. The enemy said, I will pursue, yea I will overtake; And of the spoyl which shal be found I will division make. Upon them I will satisfie my lust, and it fulfil; I will draw out my sword, my hand shall them destroy and kill. 10. Thy winds did blow, and over them the sea it self did spread; And in the mighty waters they sank down like lumps of lead. 11. O who is there that's like to thee, O Lord? sure there is none; Who is there like to thee among the Gods? there is not one. Glorious thou art in holiness, yea and in praises, thou Art very fearful, and thou dost abroad thy wonders show. 12. Thou didst put forth, &amp; stretchedst out the right hand of thy power; And then the earth did swallow up thy foes, &amp; them devour. 13. The people which thou hast redeem'd thou ledst forth in thy grace: Guiding them by thy strength, unto thy holy dwelling place. 14. The people they shall hear of this and fear shall them oppress; And such as dwell in Palestine, sorrow shall them possess. 15. Then Edoms dukes shal be amaz'd and trembling shall take hold On Moabs mighties, Canaans folk shall melt when this is told: 16. Yea fear and dread shall fall on them, and they shall be each one By greatness of thine arm and power as still as is a stone. Until the people which are thine, O Lord, are passed over; I say, until the folk which thou hast purchased, pass over. 17. Thou Lord shalt bring this people in, and planted they shall be Even in the mountain which belongs as heritage to thee. The place O Lord, where thou wilt dwell and where thy house shall stand, The sanctuary which thou hast establish'd with thy hand. 18. The Lord shal reign for evermore 19. For Pharaohs horse did go With charets &amp; with horsemen eke into the sea below. The Lord then made the sea return, and over them to stand; But Israels folk in midst of Sea did walk upon dry land. DEUT. XXXII. 1. Give ear to me, ye heavens high, and I will utter speech; And hear O earth, attend unto the words my mouth shal teach. 2. My doctrine as the rain shall drop my speech as dew shall pass; As rain that's small, on tender herb, as showers upon the grass. 3. Because that I will utter forth, and publish all abroad His name, who is the Lord, ascribe ye greatness to our God. 4. He is the rock, perfect his work, his ways all judgement be; A God of truth, without all sin, yea just and right is he. 5. They have themselves corrupted yea the spot which they do bear, Is not his childrens spot, perverse and crooked ones they are. 6. And do ye in this sort requite the Lord, O ye that are A foolish people, and unwise, so ye your selves declare? Is not the Lord thy father? yea and hath he not thee bought? Hath he not made &amp; stablish'd thee? Oh hath he not thus wrought? 7. Look back unto the days of old, do ye the same remember; The many generations past, do ye likewise consider. Ask thou thy father, and enquire, and he to thee will show; Ask thou the Elders, they will tell, and thou by them shalt know. 8. When the most high divided to the Nations their estate For heritage, and Adam's sons did likewise separate. Then did he set the peoples bounds, within the same to dwell, According to the number of the seed of Israel. 9. For why? the Lord his people doth his portion take to be: The lot of his inheritance, Jacob alone is he. 10. Even in a dry and desart land he found him to be cast; And in the houling wilderness, both desolate and wast. He did him gently lead about instruction also gave; And as the apple of his eye he did him keep and save. 11. As Eagle stirreth up her nest, and flutters o're her young, Spreads forth her wings, doth take &amp; bear them on her wings along. 12. So did the Lord him lead &amp; guide yea he himself alone; And as for other stranger god, with him there was not one. 13. Upon high places of the earth he made him ride, that he Might eat of such increase as in the fields abroad should be: Yea from the rock he made him suck honey, and thereon feed; And likewise oyl, which did from hard and flinty rock proceed. 14. Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, was that whereon he fed; Yea also fat of lambs and rams that were in Bashan bred. On goats he fed, yea with the fat of kidneys of the wheat; Yea and the pure blood o'th grape thou drankest with thy meat. 15. But Jesurun he waxed fat, and did begin to kick; Even thou I say art waxen fat, and likewise art grown thick. Covered with fat; then he forsook God which did him redeem, The rock of his salvation he lightly did esteem. 16. With strange gods, unto jealousie they did him much provoke; And with abominations, they his anger made to smoke. 17. To divels (not to God) they did their sacrifice present; Yea unto Gods they did not know, their wicked heart was bent. New gods (I say) whom they did serve newly come up they were; They were such gods as formerly your fathers did not fear. 18. Thou art unmindful of the rock, even him that thee begate; Yea thou forgotten hast the God that form'd thee to this state. 19. And when the Lord saw this, they were abhorr'd of him therefore, Because his sons and daughters eke provoked him so sore. 20. And being thus provok'd, he said I will now from them hide My face, and likewise I will see what end shall them betide. For why, a generation of froward ones they be; Yea they are children in whose hearts no faith at all I see. 21. With that which is not god, they made my jealousie to smoke: To anger with their vanities, they did me much provoke: I will them move to jealousie, their anger eke shall rise, And be provok'd by such as are no people, folk unwise. 22. For in mine anger kindled is a fire, which I will shew; Yea I will make it burn unto the deeps of hell below. The earth with her increase it shall consume and waste away; Foundations it shall set on fire whereon the mountains stay. 23. Yea mischiefs I will multiply, by heaps upon them send; The arrows also of my wrath I will upon them spend. 24. They shall be burnt with hunger, and also a burning heat; Bitter destruction shall devour and eat them up like meat. Yea I will send the teeth of beasts, wherewith they shall be crusht Together, with the poyson of the serpents of the dust. 25. The sword without, terror within shall stroy, and shall not spare Yongman, nor Virgin, sucking babe, nor him that hath gray hair. 26. I said that I would scatter them, and into corners chase; And cause that their remembrance should w?? men have any place. 27. Were it not for the enemy that I his wrath did fear, And adversary should himself strangely behave and bear; And lest that they should speak &amp; say our hand full high it is, And lifted up; as for the Lord, he hath not done all this. 28. For they are such a Nation, as is void of counsel sound, For understanding there is none in them for to be found. 29. O that these men were wise, that they hereto their minds would bend, To understand this thing, and would ponder their latter end. 30. How should one chase a thousand men and two ten thousand put To flight, except the Lord their rock had sold and shut them up. 31. For why, their rock, it is not like the rock whereon we stay; Our enemies themselves, if they be judges, thus will say. 32. Their vine of Sodom is the vine, and of Gomorrahs field, Yea grapes of gall, and bitter are the clusters which they yeild. 33. As Dragons poyson, is the wine that doth thereout proceed; Yea cruel venome of the Aspe, even such it is indeed. 34. Is not this laid in store with me, my treasures seal'd among: 35. Vengeance &amp; recompense, it doth of right to me belong. Their foot shal slide even in due time the day that shall them waste It is at hand, the things that shall come on them, do make haste. 36. For God shall judge his folk, and shal repent when he shall see His servants power is gone, and that shut up or left none be. 37. And then the Lord himself shall speak yea on this wise shall say, Where are their gods, their rock, in whom they trusted, and did stay? 38. Which of their sacrifices ate the fat, and drunk the wine They offer'd? let them rise, and for your safety now combine. 39. See now that I, even I am he, and with me there is none, No God with me, I kill, I make alive, even I alone. I wound, and I do heal again, and surely there is none That can deliver from my hand, or rescue, no not one. 40. For I lift up my hand on high to heaven, and then I give This word, and of my self do say for ever do I live. 41. If I my bright &amp; glittering sword shall go about to whet, On judgement if my hand take hold, and thereunto be set: Vengeance I render will on them mine enemies that are; And eke they shall rewarded be, to me a hate that bear. 41. [42.] Mine arrows they shal drunken be with blood, which shall be shed, My sword also shall flesh devour, therewith it shall be fed. The blood I say even of the slain, and them that captives be, From the beginning of revenge upon the enemy. 43. Rejoyce then O ye nations with his people, for he will Avenge his servants blood upon all them that do it spill. Upon his adversaries he the vengeance just will send, But to his land and people he his mercy will extend. The SONG of DEBORAH, Judges v. 2. Praise ye the Lord, for that he did revenge for Israel take, When as the people of themselves did willing offer make. There is no section 1 in the source document. 3. Hear O ye kings, ye Princes eke, give ear unto this thing; Even I will praise the Lord, yea I to Israels God will sing. 4. Lord when thou went'st from Seir &amp; didst march out of Edoms field, The earth did tremble, heaven drop, the clouds did water yeild. 5. The mountains fr? before the Lord even they on melting fell, Yea Sinai from before the Lord, the God of Israel. 6. In days of Shamgar, Anaths son, and eke in Jaels days The common paths were left, &amp; men did travel in by-ways. 7. They that in villages did dwell, they ceast in Israel, Till I arose, I Deborah, a mother in Israel. 8. They chose new gods, and then within the gates did war appear: Mongst forty thousand Israelites was there a shield or spear? 9. Towards Israels rulers is my heart, that did with free accord Offer themselves among the flock, for this bless ye the Lord. 10. Ye that upon white asses ride, see that ye speak and talk; Ye also that in judgement sit, and by the way do walk. 11. They that are freed from the noise shal and fear of Archers fierce, Where they did draw their water, Gods righteous acts rehearse. The acts perform'd for Villagers, in Israel that were; Then shall the people of the Lord within the gates appear. 12. Awake, awake, O Deborah, I say awake, awake, And to the uttering of a song do thou thy self betake. Barak do thou also arise, and now perform thy part, Lead captive thy captivity, Abinoams son that art. 13. Then over Nobles of the folk he made him rule to have, That did remain, ore mighty ones to me the rule he gave. 14. Gaist Amaleck there was a root of thee from Ephraim; Among thy people after thee O tribe of Benjamin. And out of Machir governours came down, and likewise men From Zebulun, that handle well the skilful writers pen. 15. The princes eke of Issachar, with Deborah they were; Even Issachar and Barak too, with her they did appear. Into the valley was he sent, yea sent on foot, but lo Reubens divisions they did cause great thoughts of heart to grow. 16. Why didst thou bide among the folds the bleating flocks to hear? Reubens divisions they did cause that great heart-searchings were 17. Beyond the river Jordan, did Gilead make his abode And why did Dan remain within his Ships that were at rode? After continued on the shore, the sea was at his side, And in his breaches he remain'd, yea there he did abide. 18. But Zebulun and Nephtali were people that did yeild To run the hazard of their lives even in the open field. 19. Kings came, yea Canaans kings, &amp; fought in Tanaach, by the brook And water of Megiddo: they no gain of money took. 20. They fought from heaven, yea the stars that in their courses were, Against the Captain Sisera in sight they did appear. 21. The ancient river Kishon, did them sweep away and drown, The river Kishon, thou my soul their strength hath trodden down. 22. Then did their horses fail them much their hoofs in sunder brake, By prancings of their mighty ones, the prancings they did make. 23. The Angel of the Lord thus said, let Meroz cursed be; Yea the inhabitants thereof, even bitterly curse ye. Because they came not to the help the help even of the Lord, Against the mighty, yea because they did not help afford. 24. Blessed be Jael, Hebers wife the Kenite, blessed she; Yea more then other women, in the tent shall blessed be. 25. He asked water, and she did with milk the man refresh; She brought forth butter, w?? she did present in lordly dish. 26. Then did she put her hand unto the nail which she had fet, And to the workmans hammer she her own right hand did set. With hammer Sisera she smote, his head she did remove, When she had pierc'd his temples, &amp; through them the nail had drove 27. And at her feet he bow'd himself he fell, and down did ly; He bow'd, &amp; fell, &amp; when he bow'd, he did ly down and dy. 28. The mother of the Captain from the window cast her ey; She looked through the lattess, and after this sort did cry. Why is it that his chariot is so long upon the way? Why is it that his Charet wheels do make such long delay? 29. The ladies wise that were w?? her thus did they answer make; Yea even from her self also she did this answer take. 30. Have they not sped, and have they not the prey divided so? That every man hath for his part a damsel, one or two. To Sisera a prey, which is with divers colours laid; A prey of divers colours, and of needle-work is made; I say of divers colours, wrought with needle on each side, Meet for the necks of them that take and do the spoyl divide 31. So let thine enemies perish all, O Lord, but as for those That love him, be they like the sun when forth in might he goes. The SONG of HANNAH, I Sam. 2. 1. My heart rejoyceth in the Lord, joyful in him am I. Yea in the Lord my horn also exalted is on high. Over mine enemies my mouth enlarged is likewise, Because that my rejoycing doth in thy salvation rise. 2. There is none holy as the Lord, for other there is none Beside thee; neither any rock like to our God, not one. 3. Do ye no more so proudly talk, do not so much exceed, And arrogancy, let it not out of your mouth proceed. For why, the Lord he is a God of knowledge, and thereby The actions which performed are, he doth them weigh and try. 4. Broken in sunder are the bows of mighty men and stout; And they that stumbled, are with strength begirded round about. 5. They that were ful, have hir'd them selves for bread, they did decrease; And they that hungry were, have found their hunger for to cease. So that to her are seven born, before that barren was, And she that many children hath, is now in feeble case. 6. It is the Lord that killeth, and alive again doth make; He bringeth down unto the grave, and from the grave doth take. 7. It is the Lord that maketh poor, he maketh rich also; He bringeth low, and then his power in lifting up doth show. 8. He raiseth up the poor from dust, and doth the begger fet From oft the dunghil, and among Princes he doth him set. That of the throne of glory, they might be by him possest, For pillars of the earth are Gods, the world on them doth rest. 9. The feet of saints he will them keep whereas the wicked shall Be silent in the dark, because by strength shall none prevail. 10. Gods adversaries they shall all to pieces broken be; Yea also out of heaven above, thunder on them shall he. The Lord shal judg the earth, he shal give strength unto his king; The horn of his anoynted he to honour high shall bring. The CHURCHES SONG, Isa. xxvi. 1. VVe have a City w?? is strong God will for it ordain Salvation, and therewith as walls and bulwarks it maintain. 2. The gates thereof do ye set ope, that thereinto may pass the righteous Nation, w?? doth keep the truth, and it embrace. 3. Thou wilt him keep in perfect peace even so shall he be blest Whose mind is staid on thee, because on thee his trust doth rest. 4. Trust ye for ever in the Lord, let him be still your stay; For in the Lord Jehovah, is such strength as lasts for aye. 5. He brings them down that dwel on high he lays the City low, Even to the ground, that lofty is, to dust he makes it bow. 6. It shall be trodden under foot, the poor on it shall make Their feet to stand, the needy ones thereon their steps shall take. 7. The just mans way is uprightness; thou Lord that art also The most upright, do streight the paths wherein the just do go. 8. Yea Lord, for thee we waited have in way thy judgements be; Our souls desire is to thy name, remembrance eke of thee. 9. Even unto thee, in the night time hath been my souls desire, Yea with my spirit, for thee I will seek early, and enquire. For when thy judgements in the earth themselves abroad do show, The worlds inhabitants will then learn righteousness to know. 10. Let favour shewed be unto the wicked, ne'retheless He will not set himself to learn and practise righteousness. Even in the land of uprightness unjustly will he deal, And not behold the Majesty the Lord doth there reveal. 11. Lord when thy hand is lifted up, they will not it behold, But yet they shall be made to see shame shall on them take hold; Even for the envy which their minds against the people bear; The fire even of thine enemies shall devour, and shall not spare. 12. Lord thou for us wilt peace ordain to us it shall be brought, For why, the works that are in us, even thou thy self hast wrought. 13. O Lord our God, even other lords ore us the rule did take, But by thee; only of thy name the mention will we make. 14. But they are dead, they shall not live deceas'd, and shal not rise. Thou hast them visited and stroy'd, their mem'ry fades likewise. 15. The nation Lord thou hast increast and thou art glorify'd, Thou hast remov'd it far abroad, throughout the earth so wide. 16. O Lord they have thee visited when they in trouble were; They poured out a prayer, when they thy chast'ning hand did bear. 17. Like one with child, whose time is neer yea is in pain, and cries By reason of her pangs, so we have been (Lord) in thine eyes. 18. We were with childe, &amp; in that state anguish and pain did find; And that w?? is by us brought forth, is as it were the wind. We have not wrought deliverance in earth, no none at all: Inhabitants eke of the world, we have not made them fall. 19. Thy dead shall live, they shal w?? my dead body rise and spring: Ye that do dwell even in the dust, do ye awake and sing. For as the dew that falls upon the herbs, and doth them spread, So is thy dew, the earth also it shall cast out the dead. FINIS.</field>
