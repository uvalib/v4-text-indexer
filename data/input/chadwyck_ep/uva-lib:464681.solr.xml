      <field name="fulltext">DE ERKENWALDO [PROLOGUE.] At London in Englonde no?t fulle longe [tyme] Sythen Crist suffride on crosse, &amp; Cristendome stablyde, Ther was a byschop in þat burghe, blessyd &amp; sacryd,— Saynt Erkenwold, as I hope, þat holy mon hatte. In his tyme in þat ton þ? temple alder-grattyst Was drawen don þat one dole to dedifie new, For hit hethen had bene in Hengyst dawes, Þat þ? Saxones vnsa?t haden sende hyder. Þai bete oute þ? Bretons, &amp; bro?t hom in-to Wales, &amp; peruertyd alle þ? pepul þat in þat place dwellide; Þen wos this reame renaide mony ronke ?eres, Til Saynt Austyn in-to Sandewiche was sende fro þ? pope. Þen prechyd he here þ? pure faythe &amp; plantyd þ? trouthe, &amp;conuertyd alle þ? communnates to Cristendame newe; He turnyd temples þat tyme þat temyd to þ? deuelle, &amp;clansyd hom in Cristes nome, &amp; kyrkes hom callid. He hurlyd owt hor ydols &amp; hade hym in sayntes, &amp; chaungit cheuely hor nomes, &amp; chargit hom better: Þat ere was of Appolyn is now of Saynt Petre; Mahon to Saynt Margrete, oþer to Maudelayne. Þ?Synagogue of þ? Sonne was sett to oure Lady; Jubiter &amp; Jono to Jhesu oþer to James; So he hom dedifiet &amp; dyght alle to dere halowes, Þat ere wos sett of Sathanas in Saxones tyme. Now þat London is neuenyd hatte þ? New Troie; Þ? metropol &amp; þ? mayster-ton hit euermore has bene; Þ? mecul mynster perinne a maghty deuel aght, &amp; þ? title of þ? temple bitan was his name; For he was dryghtyn derrest of ydols praysid, And þ? solempnest of his sacrifices in Saxon londes: Þe thrid temple hit wos tolde of Triapolitanes; By alle Bretaynes bonkes were bot othire twayne. [I.] Now of þis Augustynes art is Erkenwolde bischop At loue London ton, &amp; the laghe teches; Syttes semely in þ? sege of Saynt Paule mynster, Þat was þ? temple Triapolitan, as I tolde are. Þen was hit abatyd &amp; beten don, &amp; buggyd efte new, A noble note for þ? nones, &amp; New Werke hit hatte; Mony a mery mason was made þer to wyrke, Harde stones for to hewe with eggit toles; Mony a grubber in grete þ? grounde for to seche, Þat þ? fundement on fyrst shuld þ? fote halde; &amp; as þai m[u}kkyde &amp; mynyde, a meruayle þai founden, As ?et in crafty cronecles is kydde þ? memorie. For as þai dy?t &amp; dalfe so depe in-to þ? erthe, Þai founden fourmyt on a flore a ferly faire toumbe; Hit was a throghe of thykke ston, thryuandly hewen, With gargeles garnysht a-boute, alle of gray marbre. The spe[k]e of þ? spelunke þat spradde hit o-lofte Was metely made of þ? marbre &amp; menskefully planede, &amp; þ? bordure enbelicit with byr?t golde lettres; Bot roynyshe were þ? resones þat þer on row stoden. Fulle verray were þ? vigures, þer auisyde hom mony, Bot alle muset hit to mouthe &amp; quat hit mene shulde; Mony clerke in þat clos, with crownes ful brode, Þer besiet hom a-boute no?t, to brynge hom in wordes. Quen tithynges token to þ? ton of þ?toumbe-wonder, Mony hundrid hende men highide þider sone; Burgeys boghit þer-to, bedels ande othire, &amp; mony a mesters-mon of maners dyuerse. Laddes laften hor werke &amp; lepen þiderwardes, Ronnen radly in route with ryngande noyce; Þer commen þider of alle kynnes so kenely mony, Þat as alle þ? worlde were þider walon with-in a hondequile. Quen þ? maire with his meynye þat meruaile aspied, By assent of þ? sextene, þ? sayntuare þai kepten; Bede vnlouke þ? lidde, &amp; lay hit by-side; Þai wolde loke on þat lome quat lengyd withinne. Wy?t werke-men with þat wenten þer-tille; Putten prises þerto, pinchid one-vnder; Kaghten by þ? corners with crowes of yrne; And were þ? lydde neuer so large, þai laide hit by sone. Bot þen wos wonder to wale on wehes þat stoden, That my?t not come to to-knowe a quontyse strange; So was þ? glode with-in gay, al with golde payntyde, &amp; a blisfulle body opon þ? both[um] lyggid, — Araide on a riche wise, in rialle wedes, Al with glisnande golde his gowne wos hemmyd, With mony a precious perle picchit þer-on, &amp; a gurdille of golde bigripide his mydelle; A meche mantel on-lofte with menyuer furrit, Þ? clothe of camelyn ful clene, with cumly bordures; &amp; on his coyfe wos kest a coron ful riche, &amp; a semely septure sett in his honde. Als wemles were his wedes, with-outen any tecche, Oþer of moulynge, oþer of motes, oþir moght-freten, &amp; als bry?t of hor blee, in blysnande hewes, As þai hade ?epely in þat ?orde bene ?isturday shapen; &amp; als freshe hym þ? face &amp; the fleshe nakyde, Bi his eres &amp; bi his hondes þat openly shewid, With ronke rode as þ? rose, &amp; two rede lippes, As he in sounde sodanly were slippide opon slepe. Þer was spedeles space to spyr vschon oþer Quat body hit my?t be þat buried wos ther; How longe had he þer layne, his lere so vnchaungit, &amp; al his wede vnwemmyd, — þus ylka weghe askyd: ‘Hit my?t not be bot suche a mon in my[n]de stode longe; He has ben kynge of þis kithe, as couthely hit semes, He lyes doluen þus depe; hit is a derfe wonder Bot summe segge couth say þat he hym sene hade.’ Bot þat ilke note wos noght, for nourne none couthe, Noþer by title, ne token, ne by tale noþer, Þat wos breuyt in b[rut], ne in bok[e] notyde, Þat euer mynnyd suche a mo[n], more ne lasse. Þ? bode-worde to þ? byschop was broght on a quile, Of þat buriede body al þ? bolde wonder; Þ? primate with his prelacie was partyd fro home; In Esex was Ser Erkenwolde, an abbay to visite. Tulkes tolden hym þ? tale [&amp;þ?] troubulle in þ? pepul, And suche a cry aboute a cors crakit euer-more; The bischop sende hit to blynne, by bedels &amp; lettres, Ande buskyd þiderwarde by-tyme on his blonke after. By þat he come to þe kyrke, kydde of Saynt Paule, Mony hym metten on þat meere, þ? meruayle to telle; He passyd in-to his palais &amp; pes he comaundit, &amp; deuoydit fro þ? d[outh]e, &amp; ditte þ? durre after. Þ? derke ny?t ouer-drofe, &amp; day-belle ronge; And Ser Erkenwolde was vp in þ? vghten ere þen, Þat wel neghe al þ? ny?t hade na[i]tyd his houres, To biseche his souerayn, of his swete grace, To vouche-safe to reuele hym hit, by a-vis[i]on or elles; ‘Þaghe I be vnworthi’ al wepande he sayde, ‘Thurghe [þ?] deere debonerte,digne hit, my Lorde, In confirmynge þ? cristen faithe, fulsen me to kenne Þ? mysterie of þis meruaile þat men opon wondres.’ &amp; so longe he grette after grace, þat he graunte hade, An ansaure of þ? Holy Goste, &amp; after-warde hit dawid. Mynster-dores were makyd opon, quen matens were songen; Þ? byschop hym shope solemply to synge þ? heghe masse. Þe prelate in pontificals was prestly atyride; Manerly with his ministres þ? masse he begynnes Of Spiritus Domini for his spede, on sutile wise, With queme questis of þ? quere, with ful quaynt notes. Mony a gay grete lorde was gedrid to herken hit (As þ? rekenest of þ? reame repairen þider ofte), Tille cessyd was þ? seruice, &amp; sayde þ? later ende, Þen heldyt fro þe autere alle þ? heghe gynge. Þ? prelate passide on þ? playn, þer plied to hym lordes; As riche reuestid as he was, he rayked to þ? toumbe; Men vnclosid hym þ? cloyster with clustrede keies; Bot pyne wos with þ? grete prece þat passyd hym after. The byschop come to þ? burynes, him barones besyde; Þ? maire with mony ma?ti men, &amp; macers before hym; Þ? dene of þ? dere place deuysit al on fyrst, Þ? fyndynge of þat ferly with fynger he mynte. ‘Lo, Lordes,’ quoþ þat lede, ‘suche a lyche here is, Has layn loken here on-loghe, how longe is vnknawen; &amp; ?et his colour &amp; his clothe has ca?t no defaute, Ne his lire, ne þ? lome þat he is layde inne. Þer is no lede opon lyfe of so longe age Þat may mene in his mynde þat suche a mon regnyd, Ne noþer his nome ne his note nourne of one speche; Queþer mony porer in þis place is putte into graue, Þat merkid is in oure martilage his mynde for euer. &amp; we haue oure librarie la[i]tid þes longe seuen dayes, Bot one cronicle of þis kynge con we neuer fynde; He has non layne here so longe, to loke hit by kynde, To malte so out of memorie, bot meruayle hit were.’ ‘Þou says soþe,’ quoþ þ? segge þat sacrid was byschop, ‘ Hit is meruaile to men, þat mountes to litelle Towards þ? prouidens of þ? Prince þat Paradis weldes, Quen hym luste to vnlouke þ? leste of his my?tes. Bot quen matyd is monnes my?t, &amp; hs mynde passyde, And al his resons are to-rent, &amp; redeles he stondes, Þen lettes hit hym ful litelle to louse wyt a fynger Þat alle þ? hondes vnder heuen halde my?t neuer. Þere-as creatures crafte of counselle oute swarues, Þe comforthe of þe creatore byhoues þe c[reat]ue take. &amp; so do we now oure dede, deuyne we no fyrre; To seche þe sothe at oure-selfe, ?ee se þer no bote; Bot gl[e]w we alle opon Godde, &amp; his grace aske, Þat careles is of counselle, [vs] comforthe to sende. [Anande] þat in fastynge of ?our faithe &amp; of fyne bileue, I shal auay ?ow so verrayly of vertues his, Þat ?e may leue vpon longe þat he is lord my?ty, &amp; fayne ?our talent to fulfille, if ?e hym frende leues.’ [II.] Then he turnes to þ? toumbe &amp; talkes to þ? corce; Lyftande vp his eghe-lyddes, he loused suche wordes: ‘Now, lykhame, þat þ[us] lies, layne þou no lenger, Sythen Jhesus has iuggit to-day his ioy to be schewyde! Be þou bone to his bode, I bydde in his behalue; As he was bende on a beme, quen he his blode schedde, As þou hit wost wyterly, &amp; we hit wele leuen, Ansuare here to my sawe, councele no trouthe! Sithen we wot not qwo þou art, witere vs þ?-selwen, In worlde quat weghe þou was, &amp; quy þow þus ligges, Ho longe þou has layne here, &amp; quat laghe þou vsyt, Qeper art þou ioyned to ioy oþer iugged to pyne.’ Quen þ? segge hade þus sayde, &amp; syked þer-after, Þ? bry?t body in þ? burynes bray[þ]ed a litelle, &amp; with a drery dreme he dryues owte wordes Þurghe s[um] lyf[ly] goste, lant of hym þat al redes:— ‘Bisshop,’ quoþ þis ilke body, ‘þ? boode is me dere, I may not bot boghe to þ? bone for bothe myn eghen; Þ? name þat þou neuenyd has &amp; nournet me after Al heuen &amp; helle heldes to, &amp; erthe bitwene. Fyrst to say the þ? sothe quo my selfe were, — One þ? vnhapnest hathel þat euer on erhte ?ode, Neuer kynge ne cayser ne ?et no kny?t nothyre, Bot a lede of þ? laghe þat þen þis londe vsit. I was committid &amp; made a mayster-mon here, To sytte vpon syd causes þ?? cite I ?emyd, Vnder a prince of parage of paynymes laghe, &amp; vche segge þat him sewide þ? same faythe trowid. Þ? lengthe of my lyinge here, þat is a l[app]id date Hit to m[ut]he to any mon to make of a nombre: After þat Brutus þis burghe had buggid on fyrste No?t bot [aght] hundred ?ere þer aghtene wontyd — Before þat kymmed ?our Criste by cristen acounte [Þre hundred] ?ere &amp; pritty mo &amp; ?et threnen aght, I was [o]]n eire of an oye[r] in þ? New Troie In þ? regne of þ? riche kynge þat rewlit vs þen, The bolde Breton Ser Belyn, — Ser Berynge was his brothire — Mony one was þ? busmare boden hom bitwene For hor wrakeful werre, quil hor wrathe lastyd, — Þen was I iuge here enioynyd in gentil lawe.’ Quil he in spelunke þus spake þer sprange in þ? pepulle In al þis worlde no worde, ne wakenyd no noice, Bot al as stelle as þ? ston stoden &amp; listonde, With meche wonder forwrast, &amp; wepid ful mony. The bisshop bides þat body, ‘biknowe þ? cause, Sithen þou was kidde for no kynge, quy þou þ? cron weres. Qu haldes þou so heghe in honde þe septre, &amp; hades no londe of lege men, ne life ne lym aghtes?’ ‘Dere ser,’ quop þ? dede body, ‘deuyse þ? I thenke, Al was hit neuer my wille þat wroght þus hit were; I wos deputate &amp; domesmon vnder a duke noble, &amp; in my power þis place was putte al to-geder. I iustifiet þis ioly toun on gentil wise, &amp; euer in fourme of gode faithe, more þen fourty wynter. Þ? folke was felonse &amp; fals, &amp; frowarde to reule; I hent harmes ful ofte, to holde hom to ri?t. Bot for wothe ne wele ne wrathe ne drede, Ne for maystrie ne for mede ne for no monnes aghe, I remewit neuer fro þ? ri?t, by reson myn awen, For to dresse a wrange dome, no day of my lyue. Declynet neuer my consciens, for couetise on erthe, In no gynful iugement no iapes to make, Were a renke neuer so riche, for reuerens sake, Ne for no monnes manas, ne meschefe ne routhe. Non gete me fro þ? heghe gate to glent out of ry?t, Als ferforthe as my faithe confourmyd my hert; Þaghe had bene my fader bone, I bede hym no wranges, Ne fals fauour to my fader, þaghe felle hym be hongyt. &amp; for I was ry?twis &amp; reken, &amp; redy of þ? laghe, Quen I deghed, for dul denyed alle Troye; Alle menyd my dethe, þ? more &amp; the lasse; &amp; þus to bounty my body þai buriet in golde, — Cladden me for þ? curtest þat courte couthe þen holde, In mantel for þ? mekest &amp; monlokest on benche; Gurden me for gouern[ance þ?] graythist of Troie, Furrid me for þ? fynest of faithe [þer] withinne. For þ? honour of myn honeste of heghest enprise, Þai coronyd me þ? kidde kynge of kene iustises, Þ[at] euer was tronyd in Troye oþer trowid euer shulde; And for I rewardid euer ri?t, þai raght me the septre.’ Þ? bisshop baythes hym ?et, with bale at his hert, Þaghe men menskid him so, how hit my?t worthe Þat his clothes were so clene; ‘in cloutes, me thynkes, Hom burde haue rotid &amp; bene rent in rattes longe sythen. Þ? body may be enbawmyd, hit bashis me noght Þat hit that ryne ne rote ne no ronke wormes; Bot þ? coloure ne þ? clothe, I know in no wise How hit my?t lye by monnes lore &amp; last so longe.’ ‘Nay, bisshop,’ quoþ þat body, ‘enbawmyd wos I neuer, Ne no monnes counselle my clothe has kepyd vnwemmyd; Bot þ? riche kynge of reson, þat ri?t euer alowes, &amp; loues al þ? lawes lely þat longen to trouthe; &amp; moste he menskes men for mynnynge of ri?tes, Þen for al þ? meritorie medes þat men on molde vsen; &amp; if renkes for ri?t þus me arayed has, He has lant me to last þat loues ry?t best.’ ‘?ea, bot say þou of þ? saule,’ þen sayd þ? bisshop. ‘Quere is ho stablid &amp; stadde, if þou so stre?t wroghtes? He þat rewardes vche a renke as he has ri?t seruyd My?t euel for-go the to gyfe of his grace summe brawnche. For as he says in his sothe psalmyde writtes: “Þ? skilfulle &amp; þ? vnskathely skelton ay to me.” For-þi say me of þ? soule, in sele quere ho wonnes, And of þ? riche restorment þat ra?t hyr oure LOrde!’ Þen hummyd he þat þer lay, &amp; his hedde waggyd, &amp; gefe a gronynge ful grete, &amp; to Godde sayde:— ‘Ma?ty maker of men, thi myghtes are grete, How my?t þ? mercy to me amounte any tyme? Nas I a paynym vnpreste, þat neuer thi plite knewe, Ne þ[?] mesure of þ? mercy, ne þ? mecul vertue, Bot ay a freke faithles þat faylid þ? laghes, þat euer þou, Lord, wos louyd in? Allas, þ? harde stoundes! I was non of þ? nombre þat þou with noy boghtes With þ? blode of thi body vpon þ? blo rode; Quen þou herghedes helle-hole, &amp; hentes hom þer-oute, Þ[?] loffynge, oute of Limbo, þou laftes [m]e þer, &amp; þer sittes my soule þat se may n[o] fyrre, Dwynande in þe derke dethe, þat dy?t vs oure fader, Adam, oure alder, þat ete of þat appulle Þat mony a ply?tles pepul has poysned for euer. ?e were entouchid with his te[c]he &amp; t[o]ke in þ? gl[e]tte, Bot mendyd with a medecyn, ?e are made for to lyuye, — Þat is fulloght in fonte, with faitheful bileue; &amp; þat han we myste alle merciles, myselfe &amp; my soule. Quat wan we with oure wele-dede þat wroghtyn ay ri?t, Quen we are dampnyd dulfully into þe depe lake, &amp; exiled fro þat soper so, þat solempne fest, Þer richely hit arne refetyd þat after right hungride? My soule may sitte þer in sorow, &amp; sike ful colde, Dy[m]ly in þat derke dethe, þer dawes neuer morowen, Hungrie in-with helle-hole, &amp; herken after meeles, Longe er ho þat soper se, oþer segge hyr to lathe.’ Þus dulfully þis dede body deuisyt hit sorowe, Þat alle wepyd for woo, þ? wordes þat herden; &amp; þ? bysshop balefully bere don his eghen, Þat hade no space to speke, so spakly he ?oskyd, Til he toke hym a tome, &amp; to þ? toumbe lokyd, To þ? liche þer hit lay, with lauande teres:, ‘Oure Lord lene,’ quoþ þat lede, ‘þat þou lyfe hades, By Goddes leue, as longe as I my?t lacche water, &amp; cast vpon þ? faire cors, &amp; carpe þes wordes, — “I folwe þ? in þ? Fader nome &amp; his fre Childes &amp; of þ? gracious Holy Goste”; — &amp; not one grue lenger. Þen þof þou droppyd doun ded, hit daungerde me lasse.’ With þat worde þat he warpyd, [of his] wete eghen [Þ?] teres trillyd adon, &amp; on þ? toumbe lighten; &amp; one felle on his face, &amp; þ? freke syked; Þen sayd he with a sadde soun, ‘Oure Sauyoure be louyd! Now herid be þou, heghe God, &amp; þ? hende Moder, &amp; blissid be þat blisful houre þat ho the bere in! &amp; also be þou, bysshop, þ? bote of my sorowe, &amp; þ? relefe of þ? lodely lures þat my soule has leuyd in! For þ? wordes þat þou werpe, &amp; þ? water þat þou sheddes, Þ? bry?t bourne of þin eghen, my bapteme is worthyn; Þ? fyrst slent þat on me slode slekkyd al my tene; Ry?t now to soper my soule is sette at þ? table. For with þ? wordes &amp; þ? water þat weshe vs of payne Li?tly lasshit þer a leme loghe in þ? abyme, Þat spakly sprent my spyrit with vnsparid murthe Into þ? cenacle solemply þer soupen alle trew; &amp; þer a marcialle hyr mette with menske alder-grattest, &amp; with reuerence a rowme he ra?t hyr for euer. I heere þerof my heghe God, &amp; also þ?, bysshop, Fro bale has bro?t vs to blis, blessid þou worthe!’ Wyt this cessyd his sowne, sayd he no more; Bot sodenly his swete chere swyndid &amp; faylide, And alle the blee of his body wos blakke as þ? moldes, As roten as þ? rottok þat rises in powdere. For as sone as þ? soule was sesyd in blisse, Corrupt was þat oþer crafte þat couert þ? bones; For þ? ay-lastande life, þat lethe shalle neuer, Deuoydes vche a vayne glorie, þat vayles so litelle. Þen wos louynge oure Lorde with loves vp-halden; Meche mournynge &amp; myrthe was mellyd to-geder; Þai passyd forthe in procession, &amp; alle þ? pepulle folowid, And alle þ? belles in þ? burghe beryd at ones.</field>
