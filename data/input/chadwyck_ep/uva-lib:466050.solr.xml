      <field name="fulltext">[If hours in nets and hours in games] If hours in nets and hours in games are added truthfully together, i must have run twelve thousand miles in loyalty to solid leather. loaning his legs some forty years to cricket till their worth is ended should help a man to worry less about the job that can't be mended. OUT OF SEASON April's here, and frankly warming Lambs along their little spines. Primrose families are swarming Where, above anemones, Many aldermanic bees Drone in search of honey-mines. April's fair for maids that seek Southern violets near a thicket. Blest are they! But what of lads That hunger for a pair of pads And other implements of Cricket? Cuckoo's here, and loudly stating Lesser folk should build at speed, Since his wife is ruminating Where to lodge, in briar or quick, First the egg, and then the chick Servantbirds will have to feed. April's fair for celandines Squandering gold in Surrey ditches. Blest are they! But how can that Be first-class pleasure to the Bat Deprived so very long of pitches? Game of Glory! come to kindle Lad in hut and lad in hall Now that apprehensions dwindle, Now that doting lovers quit Carpet crease and Centuries hit Dreamwise from a ghostly ball. April's fair with loveliness Lent to man by almond branches. Blest is man! But what of those Big Yorkers that, from friendly foes, Come down in May like avalanches? THE MASTER Overhead a sky of speedwell, Pampered yards of green below; Girls to flutter each Brightonian Substitute for Romeo; Tents with beer for barleycorners Husky at the luncheon hour; All of these are proof that Cricket's Bursting fiercely into flower. Hove is where I breathe contented Now that lilac in array Publishes the white and purple Masterpieces due to May. Here I puff a cloud and wonder What decrees of darkling Fate Govern heroes soon to tackle Every subterfuge of Tate. Sinfield neck-and-crop to Langridge, Nothing but a leg-bye scored! Enters now the dreaded Hammond, Gloucester County's overlord. Deeper, Cover Point! and deeper, You that guard the boundaries there! When she comes you won't have even Half a tick of time to spare! Thud! She's made a fat civilian Scuttle to preserve the bone Threatened by a bomb of leather Wensley could but leave alone. Thud! She's squandered twenty schoolboys Rolling in a general laugh. How the antic figures caper Furious on the Telegraph! This is almost youth recovered! Keen I quiver in my chair, Even sensing those electric Crackles common to the hair. This is England for the English, Now that Hammond, come in May, Drives his flock of Fours, presenting Ringside hearts with holiday! A VETERAN Had Fate In handsome mood permitted me to bowl As well as Maurice Tate, I should have felt remarkably elate. That verve! Where green is overhung by cornflower blue His courage, muscle, nerve Supply the double gift of Length and Swerve. I sit Glad-hearted on a bench and note How Sussex vim and grit Make red-rose Lancaster decline to hit. To-day Is watching weather of the golden sort, And I propose to stay As long as lads are authorized to play. Should damp Arrive to-morrow from the deuce knows where, My set of bones will tramp Pavilionward with Hope beneath a gamp. For bowls, And what appears to be a crafty plan, With eighteen little holes, For goading men to jeopardize their souls, I care With fully ten times less the warmth I feel If cricket-driven where The use of turf is use beyond compare. Had Fate In frank goodhumour settled long ago To bracket me with Tate, I should have felt astoundingly elate! FINE FEVER His look is like the look of one Demented by superfluous sun At mischief in the brain. What frets him is a tricky ode For issue in The Starlit Road About the crime of Cain. Do what he will, some fancies rove Toward the weathered bench at Hove Where yesterday he sat; And boyhood bubbles up in play To fizz till he can slip away To watch his County bat. I know how fast the pen will tear Along his lines, as if a hare Were sprinting on the sheet, With dogs, ferociously inclined, Not nearly far enough behind That locomotive meat. The rumpled fashion of the mop Of foliage on his clever top Denotes a bothered bard. To tackle for a lengthy time With stanzas any sort of crime Is labour; and it's hard. But comma, semi-colon, dash, With other signs producing cash From journalistic Jove, No longer persecute a head Deprived of cricket. Work is dead, And Hove is doubly Hove! TWO Daffodils in plenty, Glorious in a jug, Set me scoring twenty Boundaries on the rug. Piccadilly trumpets, Some of sovereign hue, Some as pale as crumpets, Seem to publish you, Cricket!âthe Upholder Lads rejoice to love, Loosing arm and shoulder, Buttoning a glove. Though the Age of Reason Dawdles on the way, Since the Cricket Season Cannot come till May, Golf, the ever ready, Over league and league Fascinates the heady Scorner of fatigue. Day by day assemble Near a tiny pit Harlequins who tremble When they dare the hit. Do not think I blame them Loosely for the sins Causing me to name them Here as harlequins. Even rosy Flappers Deprecate the use Made of various wrappers, Crocus, violet, puce. Super-roomy knickersâ Probably Plus Eightsâ Move to sudden snickers Joans and Sues and Kates. Why, in tints surpassing Rainbow's colour-plan, Scorch the fairway, glassing Woman in the man? Cricket seldom offers Yards of over-bright Pabulum to scoffers Wincing at the sight. Though at times a gazer Jibs at what he sees Flaunted by a blazer Fit for chimpanzees, Less of feminizing Marks the Golden Game Year by year devising Supplements for Fame. Cricket's round the corner, April wellnigh dumb. Many a supple Horner Longs to pick the plum Coveted by wristy Batsmen, quick of pose, Dealing with the twisty Venom of their foes. Century plum!âthe Beauty Swelling in our sight; Century plum!âthe fruity British-born delight. Welcomers of creases, Proud to be alive, Shed your winter fleeces, Rush toward the Drive! When at last the roller Yields to sinewy play, When at last the bowler Proves that May is May, Nobly flaunt the fashion Hidden for half a year While the winter's passion Kept us runless here. Look! The Circle, rounded, Clad in crimson, comes Ready to be pounded. Pound it till it hums! WHO? Out of the cool pavilion comes, His face a trifle Flemish, At twelve o'clock by Benjamin, A Bat without a blemish. For tingling lads and greying dads And girls as keen as mustard He's England in a pair of pads, Dark, competent, unflustered. Into the cool pavilion comes While four o'clock is chiming, Amid a gale of London cheers, This overlord of timing. Beside his name upon the frame That telegraphs the story Two never-beaten hundreds flame As stars for Madam Glory! TESTWARD All hail the Sixteen Names! We clearly see That each selected man is fit to be Where what are known to us as Bumper Gates Let vivid banter voice in broad-flung States Colonial ringside Doric, barbed to show That slang is quick when figuring is slow Upon the Telegraph. What thousands roar At Rip Van Winkle and his sleepy score! We honour all the names, the one not least Of him whose homes are England and the East. But all are noble in this noble quest Of what was torn from England by the best Australian type of grit. Below, on deck, Each Argonaut will shuffle ways to wreck Bradmanian skill, and every dreaming head Will catch or bowl or run him out in bed. But what of Captaincy? Our Leader's brain And smouldering fire are signals of a strain In rigid keeping with the sport that hurled A hardened ball of leather round the world. In crisis, come what will, he never serves The Golden Game with aught but iron nerves, And never falters when prevailing odds Are such as seem the malice of the gods. All hail the Sixteen Names! We think them those Of likely lads to force down-under foes To bear the second place, yet cheer the band Returning laurelled to the Motherland. 'Twas bellying canvas lifted to the foam That curls along the ceiling of his home Imperial Neptune; but a steamer might, With Ashes, bring the salty God in sight! (1932) DOWN AND UP âThis 'ere is wot I'd do,â said he, âIf I was you an' you was me, I'd grin, an' rummidge in my fob Or trousis pocket for a bob, An' frank a down-an'-outer through The turnstile, Guvnor, same as you, To blow a cloud an' take a squint At Robins on the sprint.â âUpon my word, I feel you would, Without a murmur, if you could. There's cricket in your face, or so A stranger thinks who ought to know. As silver's lazy in my fob, Suppose a florin gets the job Of buying what you call a squint Of Robins on the sprint!â A REBUKE Let be! Let be! Our Cricket Team is chosen For the Testing oversea. Why call Selectors donkey-men Because you miss a name or two? In other words, old Grumbler, Let me recommend to you Less vinegared a view. Let be! Let be! The men have proved their fitness To the sovereign M.C.C. I question if the Motherland Has finer all-round worth to send. In any case, Old Grumbler, It is sporting to defend The Team you cannot mend. Agree! Agree To join me in a gamble For a little L.S.D.! A paper pound against a pound In paper that our heroes bring The Ashes back, Old Grumbler, From the fifth and final Ring To England in the Spring! MISS VENUS Between the day for starting On our Cricket Season here And mid-September's parting From the best of all the year A sugared hussy, little, And as wayward as a dream, Began to prove how brittle Was the Tranton Valley team. If ever Venus fashioned For the bringing of defeats A Beauty over-rationed In regard to fatal sweets, This girl, intent on spooning Wheresoever she might be, Provocative of mooning, Most undoubtedly was she. The rot began when Merton, Who was Captain of the side, Because the maid from Girton Seemed the shadow of a bride, At lunch, with bleak insistence, Thrust away his half-and-half And glared upon the distance Like a puzzled orphan calf. He won her pledge. She jilted With an air of unconcern Our Captain. How he wilted When his brother took a turn! This blast of variation Was destructive too of Ned. In short, the ruination Whirled along from A to Z. Full fifty years will wither Into nothingness before Our memories cease to dither In the cold of what we bore When Tranton Valley, duffered By the singeing of that Flame, Throughout the season suffered, Twice a week, repulsive shame! TENTH His trousers, they were gloomy, his shirt was old and coarse, His braces gleamed as yellow as a head of flowering gorse. His walk toward the wicket showed an agricultural lurch Seen commonly in cornfields, and less commonly in church. Arriving tenth, in such a rig, he seemed the sort of loot Ungenerous Chance assigns to those that need a Substitute. Well, You never can tell. Refusing all directions that an umpire loves to name, He thrust his forelock backward and at last disposed his frame So bumpkinly that each of us, too confident of luck, Believed his contribution could be nothing but a Duck; For such a garb and such a pose seemed likely to forbid The whole of what, in point of fact, this Boanerges did. Well, You never can tell. Maliciously it happened, by a cunning freak of Fate, That Captain Thomas Silleryâhe thinks himself a Tateâ Was destined to deliver what he hoped would be the ball Adroit enough to bring about the beefy stranger's fall. The circle flew. Its resting-place was difficult to fix, But what the umpire's signal meant undoubtedly was SIX. Well, You never can tell. The Substitute, without a grin of satisfaction, hitched His waistband higher, regardless of the leather he had ditched, But Thomas, greatly rattled, stood and gnawed upon his thumb While waiting for the cheers to stop, the pounded ball to come. Anew he galloped twenty yards, and, smarting from the stain, He slung her down, a thunderbolt! She cost him SIX again. Well, You never can tell. What followed was a pestilence of horrifying slogs. The fielders ran like prairie fires and puffed like winded dogs. Our Captain, red as beetroot first, and then, as paper, white So bogged himself in panic that the Cup went out of sight! For not till eighty-seven runs, the crop of many a clout, Had overworked the Telegraph was Gloomy Trousers out. Well, You never can tell. SHE Think of her value! She's a ball, Not very large, not very small. Year in, year out, she does for Peace Far more than millions of police; Far more than all the vexing herds Of politicians drunk with words; Far more than Missions sent to bless The heathen soul with Godliness; Far more than all the cheaper mass Of never-ending Conference gas; Far more than what is but a League, Its backbone sagging in fatigue, Less able than a farmyard cat To nipâand crunchâa poisonous rat. Give her a handclasp! She's the ball, Not very big, not very small, That signalizes every day, At Home, or half the world away, Fond England's Masterpiece of Play. SAFETY FIRST Let London wait! Your round of bread Need never be more thickly spread With butter's leading line. Give gold a miss! At Hove to-day The cracks of Kent and Sussex play The game that's trebly fine. Confound the cash! Your eyes disclose The daily nearness of your nose To documents in Town. Give greed a rest! To-day at Hove Decline to be a City Jove At odds with fret and frown. Your bagging cheeks, your dulling lips, Are danger-signals of eclipse To gloom a bilious fate. Financial sceptre? Toss it by, And underneath a wealthy sky Neglect the glittering bait! How often, very long ago, When runaways from Cicero, We knew athletic peace! A shilling was our talisman For demi-gods. With them we ran In thought from crease to crease. Stiff-jointed, colourless as paste, You sit in Town and run to waist, A man unmanned by gold. With boyhood stirring in the mind, Let Cricket help your heart to find The lad you were of old. Pavilionward! Why slave to greet The stethoscope of Harley Street? Be dead to office rule, And, rolling roycily along The tarmac, hum that clinking song You learnt at Harrow School! THERE AND BACK From seven to twelve I had a rage For staring at the printed page. With mental legs how fast I ran To be an English Mohican Along the trail of Do and Dare, A barnyard feather in my hair! Nancy and Oliver were friends For whom I treasured candle-ends, And, kneeling by the bed at night, Went red with love and pale with fright. My Mother, fondness in her eyes, Was glad to feed me with surprise And brace me when I fell among Such words as daunted lip and tongue. Then suddenly I burst away From healthy print to healthier play. No more at Coilantogle Ford I stood and kept me with my sword. I seemed to hear a voice cry, âLook! The Bat is mightier than the Book. Be Uncas, Hereward, Rob Roy, Horatius after Cricket, Boy!â Imagine me the supple serf Of two-and-twenty yards of turf For season after season, till Age led me quietly downhill! I did not join, as some do then, The cranky League of Withered Men That sit and add to bygone scores Unwarrantable Threes and Fours, But, pithless, I renewed my rage For staring at the printed page. âSEPPYâ I cannot say That I would frequently consent to play With Septimus Dundreary on my side. He loves to lag; He seems affected by a general sag Of blazer, trousers, collar, waist-line, bag. His ready purse Prevents official tongues from being terse When Seppy blinks and potters in the field. What runs we lose At times because those duffing hands refuse The service delegated to his shoes! In vain I hint That even his rotundity would sprint A little better for a touch of pride. Well-pleased to hug Incompetence, he answers with a shrug, And goes on functioning as a human slug. His single bound Is when the caterer's bell begins to sound A notice that the various pies are due. Then, quaffing malt, He liquidates a shallow sense of fault, And ends by feeling worth his Cricket salt! BAFFLED When lunch was over, John and Jake, being truly startled men, Linked arms, to hold each other up while walking round the field, And spoke in undertones of what had happened in the tent To mystify the pair of them. No wonder that they reeled! âThe fellow's not a mortal; he's a blinking demi-god,â Said John in consternation. âYou can bet your income, Jake, The like of this has not been known since oily Aaron's rod Completely flummoxed Pharaoh by its appetite for snake.â âMy single satisfaction is the thought that if I bat, And chance to send the ball to him, I'm bound to score a run; For miracles are out of date, and if he quickly stoops To gather and return her, then a miracle is done. It's not alone his flourishes with salad, pastry, cheese, And nearly half a cottage loaf that made me gasp and stare. Good Lord! he wolfed three helpings of a steak-and-kidney pie And fifteen new potatoes, for I counted them with care.â Jake wobbled on the turfing for a moment. Then he said, âPerhaps he snored in bed too long and had to take the road Without his fill of sausages. That trouble would explain Your demi-god's ability to bite an over-load. We found at School that Hercules, when nasty jobs were done, Was such a trencherman as shook beholders to the core; But even he could scarcely hope, if cricketing to-day, To equal anywhere on turf this hefty luncheon score.â Imagine how we stood about with pipes and cigarettes Beneath a sky of Oxford blue to note our famous pair! Imagine how we chuckled when the demi-god sent down Three wides, then stamped a savage foot and tugged a hank of hair! Amusedly we saw him rush to sling along the next, Believing we were hand in glove, because of food, with Luck. The next arrived. The next returned, as if a red grenade To blow the trundler off the field. He grabbed her, and she stuck! How tragic was the sequel! I defy an acrobat To utilize on any stage his arms and legs and hips So well as he that blunted there a Century of jokes By fury at the bowling crease and sinew in the Slips. When John, a dismal victim of the only ball he had, Returned to us, he whispered, as he crumbled in a chair, The blighter wolfed three helpings of a steak-and-kidney pie And fifteen new potatoes, for I counted them with care. BIG BROTHER Don't apologize for turning From the Latin you are learning To the Oval! Go on burning To become a Surrey Bat! Kept in funds by being single, I'm prepared with yours to mingle Cash to subsidize the tingle You demand. So that is that. All my cronies in committee Vote to save you from a gritty Set of Chambers in the City And my partner does the same; For we want that pair of shoulders, On a greener Green than Golders, Soon to mesmerize upholders Of the game that's twice a game. None has ever seen a fitter Boy to broaden and to glitter As a neck-or-nothing hitter With a quantum of defence; But, remember that a body Quickly turns to human shoddy If the soul's a dud. Well, Roddy, Can you bank on Sober Sense? Right! The Colt who would be colting Is a youngster now revolting From hexameters and jolting Julius Caesar on the point. Far from booky Rome and Greece's Verbs that have so many pieces, Here he dedicates to creases Every sinew, every joint. Off you go!âa flannelled rover Till the Cricket Season's over, When our business branch at Dover, Rightly famous in the Port, Will disclose the worth of bending Grave above your desk and spending On a job in need of mending Care as though itself a sport. A SUGGESTION Why not? For queerer things occur Upon our planet every day; Produce a big or little stir, And wither in the usual way, As anybody knows. Remembering this, I fail to see The reason why there cannot be, Perhaps in Nineteen forty-three, A Test at Kennington between Eleven Umpires, fat or lean, And twenty Eskimos. Why not? This couldn't be more odd Than playing quoits with Sadducees, Or Polo at the Cape of Cod, Or Duplicated Bridge with Crees, Whose forcing bids are knives. For fans of Frolic, what a boon To see in either May or June The scorer wearing a harpoon, As though to indicate dispatch, Should Northland fail to win the match, Of several Surrey lives. Why not? The simple truth is this, Dislike it starkly as we may: Too many games are good to miss, And others even worse than they, If Red or White the Rose. Consider him who can't be brought To field because his merrythought Is not behaving as it ought! Besides, a fleck or two of sleet Would never terrorize the feet Of manly Eskimos. THE DREAM One night the Three Selectors Came and stood beside my bed. I found it hard to credit Their belief in what they said. They begged of me to captain The Team prepared to go Across the sea to Bradman, And I countered them with No! Immediately the spokesman Of the Three began to shout Confoundedly, and scatter Certain adjectives about. On hearing that Old England Was determined (this was odd) To elect me for a season As a sort of Cricket god, I began in turn to colour Like a beetroot, and to shout Consumedly, and sprinkle Other adjectives about. I told them I was busy With an Epic in the West. Instanter those Selectors Were a mass upon my chest. Surrendering, I bolted To the Liner with a bat And drove for four along the deck The Steward's yellow cat. When flannelled in Australia, How I bruised the willow-wood! How I punished Clarence Grimmett As an English Captain should! The total score of Bradman When our enterprise was doneâ The Ashes in my kitbagâ Was an egg denoting None. What luck! The heart of England Would be more than peacock-proud. My fancy heard the cheering Of the Homeland, long and loud, And tried to count the faces Of the thousands come to roar In volume, that the welkin might Oblige, as heretofore. Her demi-gods had silvered Afresh the rusted shield, Had shaken hands with Glory, Had thunderously appealed. The battle won, they longed to hear The roar of London pride Repay them for the total sum Of handicaps defied In honour of the deathless game That Hambledon supplied. Well, Hope was but a cripple, And Fancy but a cheat, And Justice little else than rind Of what is sour to eat. The Dream, so patriotic, So bewildering, so glib, Turned out to be as duddy As a saturated squib Refusing to be tempted By a gambol in the sky When starlit merrymakers roast Their tipsy-looking guy. Imagine how at Waterloo It went against the grain To find that not a single soul Had come to meet our train! ENTANGLEMENT To do my best With bat and ball From twelve o'clock Till evenfall; Maintain a length, Avoid a blob, Is what I call An English job. When days are gold And turf is prime, When Fours are hit In summertime, My head, as though The game were done, Begins to rhyme For me in fun. Though Captain Work Must have me wear Afresh for him That pinchy pair Of breadtime shoes, Remembrance comes, To sweeten care, With sugarplums. Do what I will To disarray The mental sprites I cannot stay, These bring the match Not rightly due Till Saturday, And play it through! HUNGER He was very near the Oval When I caught his starving look. Was he Empty Purse on holiday, Or dole-defended crook? I passed, then turned upon my heel To front him, bleak and sad. The build of head, the eyes, the chin Were such as made me glad. âAnything the matter, lad? In pain? Would a bun and cup of cocoa Give you confidence again?â He had learnt that Hobbs was nearly At the hundred mark once more. Of a sudden came the leather-lunged And rolling Surrey roar. Though sixty, I had never seen Devotion thus employ Beside a fence at Kennington A starrier flash of joy. âHow about a shilling, boy? It's yours! Run along and watch the Master Help himself again to Fours!â REFLECTED GLORY Timothy and I, we are capital companions, Glad to be together, with a thousand tales to tell Full of fun belonging to the various grades of Cricket, Schoolboy, Town Club, Country House, and even Dingley Dell. Fondly we remember how a pair of horses drew us, Village after village, on our way to find a green Dotted with the canvas tents that served as gay reminders Of England's simple fashion when her Ruler was a Queen. Timothy and I, we are heart-to-heart companions Bending over Long Ago to welcome in our zest Rural Deans with ponytraps and chubby farmers bringing A rivalry of lasses to adorn the local Test. Rambling down the bygone, we recall how Billy Farmer Scored a chimneypot-and-six one day at Horsted Keynes, Where Sheffield Park in person, highly tickled by the damage, Presented half a sovereign to the Slogger for his pains. Timothy and I, we are cronies in a corner, Turning over records of the days of win and lose. Here we dote on what we did when supple in the Twenties, Here at times a hand steals down in fancy to a bruise. Surrey, Kent, and Sussex were the playing grounds when summer Freckled us and bronzed us in our passion for The Game. Bursting into Father's room to tell of laurels gathered Forcibly as batsmen or as bowlersâthat was fame! Timothy and I, in the hours of recollection, Hear the shift of harness creaking noisy in a lane; Note the yellowhammer with his little nervous sallies Disappear in greenery, to come to sight again. Pleasant was the journey to the creases of our foemen, Pleasanter the homeward ride, with Mother at the gate Fluttering her handkerchief, and wearying to kiss us, And asking what on earth had kept her pair of boys so late. Timothy and I, we are mellow in the thewless Wintering of muscle that has faded from the prime. Down with black behaviour! for to envy lads upholding England at the block-hole is to tweak the nose of Time. Innings after innings was permitted, and he gave us Verve in double handfuls, till he had no more to spare. Now he nods goodhumouredly to athletes of remembrance Snug upon a hearthrug. How we bless him for his care! THE COMING CROP Let men with tiny sons So train them early that they long for runs; And let them give potential County Caps Convenient surfaces, However far from smooth, on which to learn The game that ought to be their chief concern. For who of us can say What star is lit for England in this way? Three crooked lines of chalk upon a fence, Together with a chunk Of planking cut to shape a bat, can be Of signal service to the M.C.C. Some small professors hint At coming glory with a rounded flint. Observe! Applaud! Inspire them! Stop to help, With all the help you have, Such lads as may be destined to delight Pavilions critical of spin and flight! RUN OUT To Cricket played without a crease, Its scorers, umpires, and police, A harrowing farewell! All that I had to sing is sung, And now, being very far from young, I have no more to tell. To other pens I leave the gay Repose of quitting work for play Of measurement and chime, That winged a thousand hours and kept Me humming while the neighbours slept In ignorance of rhyme. Though often fretted by a fix, Merry I moved among the tricks Of shaping nimble verse, Sorry at times to do no better For what had made me long a debtor, Glad to have done no worse.</field>
