      <field name="fulltext">?Libya shows itself to be surrounded by water, except so much of it as borders upon Asia. Neco, king of Egypt, was the first we know of, that proved this; he, when he had ceased digging the canal leading from the Nile to the Arabian Gulf, sent certain Phoenicians in ships, with orders to sail back through the Pillars of Hercules, into the Northern Sea, and so return to Egypt. The Phoenicians accordingly, setting out from the Red Sea, navigated the Southern Sea; when autumn came, they went ashore and sowed the land, by whatever part of Libya they happened to be sailing, and waited for the harvest; and having reaped the corn, they put to sea again. When two years had thus passed, in the third, having doubled the Pillars of Hercules, they arrived in Egypt, and related what to me does not seem credible, but may to others, that as they sailed round Libya, they had the sun on their right hand. Thus was Libya first known.âHerodotus: Melpomene, 42.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THIS VOLUME IS DEDICATED WITH GRATEFUL AFFECTION TO HIS WIFE TAMA BY THE AUTHOR</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE VOYAGE OF ITHOBAL FOREWORD (IN THE MUSEUM) Half in earnest, and half in play, We talked, by the mummied Dead, that day, Noting the bones of the catalogued Pharaohs, Princes and Scribes of a world far away; Priests, with their lean brown bodies a-row, In Egypt embalmed many ages ago; Waiting their souls,âwhich did never reclaim them, What kept ye belated, Souls? Make us know! But, under the glass, at the gallery's end, Two gilded coffers our converse suspend, A dark, sweet, high-bred visage of Egypt Limned on the cedar: Inside, at bend Of elbowâarmlets with scarabs and gold, Gold rings on the delicate fingers, and fold Of linen on linen, stained blue and purple, Binding dried bosom. A comb did holdâ A comb of coralâthe rusted tress Laid, in a braid of lost loveliness, On shapely brow and mouldered temple Of the stately, holy, and proud Princess; For the name of that Lady was plain to view Nesta, the Priestess of Amen-Ru And Gods and KÃ¢s had been set to guard her Asleep, while the slow-footed years crept through. Bright were those eyes onceâstarry bright, Whose beauty gone was mocked by the light Of agate and nacreâembalmer's symbols For lustre departed. Oh! of her right Royal or high-blooded: a cartouche set Gives sign of the household of Hapshepket, And, over the heart-spot, you see a tablet From the âBook of the Deadâ inscribed âNow let âNo hindrance come at my Judgment-Hour, Nor MÃ»t be stern, nor the Measurer's power; In the balance of Thoth, when my heart is lying, May Anubis have me in grace!â A Flower Of Nile's best gardens, no doubt! Beneath The second chest showed us a painted wreath Of ships and sailors, and strange sea-monsters, And rocks that rise, and waves that seethe Round some high soul to Amenti fled: And the hieroglyphs for the style of the Dead Ran Ethbaal, the son of Magon, blended 'Mid boats and rowers, and Gods, with head Of ibis, or lion, or jackal, or ape: Yet ever, and foremost, recurred the shape Of Kneph with the ram's horns, Kneph the Master Of Storms, and of Seas, and the Southward Cape Where all Seas finish. âCertes,â I said; âSome Man of Phoenicial! a Mariner, led By fate, or love, or venture, to Egypt In the old, old times; and they claimed him dead. âAsk if in life they did meet, as in death; Find out, Dear, what that hidden sign saith; Sometimes you tell me of things we behold not, Life beyond living, speech subtler than breath.â She laughed. But quickly her laughter died; Her brown eyes misted, though fixed and wide; Through all her body ran tender tremors, Silent and rigid she pressed to my side. Presently, âYes!â she sighed, âI have willed! The place with the Presences is filled! I have seen that Lady! Ah! how she loved him! Nesta of SaÃ¯s: you would have thrilled At beauty so rich and bold and splendid (Well might he worship!) 'Twas done and ended Twenty-five centuries backâyon Hodo To say to me this from his shelf descended:â âI, Hodoâscribeâat Pharaoh's bidding, penned Dread tales, from their beginning to their close Out of the mouth of Ithobal of Tyre Chief Captain of the sea, who, by strange ways, Saw the Dark World, and went and came. He spake In Phenku, on his face before the King:â (With whom be peace, and health and length of days!) On slabs of stone I wrote itâmonth of BÃ»lâ Ninth year of Neko. May the Lord of Kings Show mercy, and forgive this scribe his faults! âDo you hear?âHe wrote, by the King's desire From lips of Ethbaal, famous in Tyreâ The chief Sea-Captainâa marvellous story Of ships which sailed thro' tempest and fire. And darkness and perils, and nether dread To lands and waters where none had sped: To Libya's HornâAh! here is another Who will not be still, till his story is said: A learned one that must speak with me, Reader in Pharaoh's Court was he, Who knew the tongues and wrote the Scriptures, And this, he doth urge, must imparted be. âI, Tchat-Kensu, Reciter to the King, Read Hodo's stones, and did them into script By order of the King, that he might hear, Again, and yet again, at resting hours, The wonders of that sailing of the seas; Also, that men to come, finding new worlds And, haply, learning more the ways of Gods, Bear themselves humble, being 'ware that deeds Greater than theirs' were wrought in days before. âHave you heard? This sage oneâthis Tchat-Kensu Lord of the Records and bidden theretoâ Tells how he pictured that story of Hodo In hieroglyphs. He says, âI rue âMy lost scrolls more than my life, which is nought, For this was the mightiest marvel wrought On all the waters, from World's beginning Till the earth and the sea shall end.â Methought To ask of IthobalââNay!â she replied âThey are gone! He, too, the man, dark-eyed, Terrible, noble, in Tyrian garments, With the great sword girded upon his side. âYet Nesta lingers, and seems would sing: Strange I can follow this ancient thing! Nesta of SaÃ¯sâshaking her sistrumâ Chanting the tale of the ships of the King. âI think she would tell us how Ithobal stood At Pharaoh's feet in his goodlihood; The brown crews kneeling around, the people Open-eyed, wide-mouthed, in earnest mood To catch those words of the wonderful sailing When, danger with daring countervailing All round that land of the nethermost darkness, This Captain of Tyre came back prevailing. (A Voice is heard) âSaÃ¯s, City of Neith, Flickered and danced in the glare: Danced in the blazing gold of the noon; Temples and gateways and trees, Like unto Temple-girls did these Dance for the glory of Neith; Golden and green and white and brown, So did the houses and groves and town, Walls, roofs, window-bars, up and down Dance for the glory of Neith. Shadows glanced on the glass of the lake, Palm-fans danced in the fluttering air, All for the Light's sweet sake; For the Goddess, mighty and glad and fair, Who makes for her people the golden day And the dear delight of the sun-warmed air, Twenty-five centuries back.â Ah, can you listen to what I say?â Egypt under the sunshine lay, Basking in gold and black. âNeko was Pharaoh and King Ruler of Nile and its lands, Lord of River and fields, Holding the World in his hands. âCrowded is Pharaoh's hall; Columns painted and tall, Cut from the rosy stones of Nile, Lead to the sculptured wall; Where the Lord of Egypt throned in state With glad and gracious ear doth wait To hear what story his ships have brought From the great deed wrought By him who sailed at the King's command To the Dark and Dread of the Nether Land, And have come alive from those realms of death. âWe will hear, we will hear, what he saithâ Hath issued decree, and the King doth sit To listen to all the marvel of it, With Princes and priests and slaves about, And of sailors and negroes a rout; Yet all eyes bound Not upon Pharaoh's face, but his Who in the midst of this, His brown crew kneeling anigh, recites, While Hodo the writer writes How he hath come and how he did go By ways on the waters which none did know. âWho is this that is standing, Greater than Pharaoh is great, Wearing no robe of state, But lordly, large, and commanding; And in his eyes the fire Of the Hawk of Horus, when out of the cloud He stoops, and his hot desire Is quenched in the flesh of the quarry slain, And the bold bird glides again Back to his niche in the temple wall? Ithobal in that hall Satisfied, resolute, stained by the Sun, Telleth to Pharaoh what things he hath done; So did my lord to the King Relate this marvellous thing.â THE FIRST DAY Ithobal, Captain of the Sea, Thus spake how it befell that he Of Pharaoh's ships did have command To sail unto the unseen land. Long life to Pharaoh! May the high Gods make Ever his greatness greater! I am he, His servant and the Captain of his ships, Ithobal, born of Tyre, bred by marge Of sea, and nursed upon the breast of the sea, To learn her ways, as little children learn The anger and the tenderness of her Who feeds, and chides, and fashions them to men. Lo! as land-dwellers con the ways of earth, The chariot-road, the camel's path in the sand, The halting places and the drinking wells, And where will be good grass, and where the rocks Hide robbers, and the swamp is home for snakes, And what to-morrow's march shall bring of hap, If sun sets ruddy, if he rises pale; So grew I from the first to know my Sea, My ship's path on the purple and the green, The friendly reefs would give her refuges, The rugged deadly coasts that she must shun, And where fair water was and pirates lurked, And how to hold a vessel's painted eyes Straight to the furrow that her stem must plough Over those dancing meadows of the deep, All day by golden guidance of the sun, All night with shimmer of the Star of Tyre, Set in the north by Ishtar for our sakes. This lore of the wide waters I did gain, And ere my chin was bearded sailed and sailed Over the midland main; threading the isles Coasting the Greek and Tuscan gulfs; one year Moored to a Libyan palm tree, and the next Rocking beneath black shade of northern pines. So did I win, ere I was man, as far As where the Western gateway of that sea Opens by Kalpe and the seven-topped mount Into what no man knoweth ofâa waste Of waves as vast as time and dark as death, Wherein the sun himself did die each night, Plunging, 'twas said, with seethe of dripping gold Into the blue. Voyaging home again With many a Keel I searched the sea of Suph Which washes Misraim, and the emerald hills, And all thy Libya down to distant Punt, And where by Gate of Wailing one might come, If one dared come, into the nether worlds. Wherefrom five years ago returning, full Of perils past and passion to meet more, I broke my galley on a bladdered shelf Which lay in the dark like shadow of a cloud. We shed upon the brine gilt cloths enough To robe it like an arch-priest, and of spice Rich bales to sweeten all its bitter salt With fragrance such as have the breasts of her Who lies by Syria's Lord. My ship I lost, My goods, my gathered profit, and my crew, Save certain here whom the deep cannot drown, Storm-seasoned against Fate. With these came I Beggared to SaÃ¯s but for one rare pearl, Fished on a moonlit night by the Isle of Birds, Which lay, a moon itself, safe at my waist. So wended I, stripped by my mother-sea, Angry, to Tyre, the great pearl in my belt And that hard hunger gnawing at my heart, To find what lay beyond the Uttermost Whence storm and death did drive back Ithobal. But what the high gods will the high gods bring After their fashion. Wrathfully I lay In shadow of Lord Melkarth's marble house That looks o'er many-storied Tyre, and dips In the Sidonian port its image wan. Listless I lay, bewailing evil fate, Life broken like my ship, my fruitless gifts On Ishtar's altar; when a silver doveâ Ishtar's own bird it seemedâlit at my foot, Preening its shining feathers, stretching forth Its glittering neck, and with red pattering feet Hither and thither pacing, out of reach As who would tempt to follow. Half amazed, Half wayward, I pursue the eluding bird Which flutters, all its silver in the sun Asparkle, down the steps of the temple porch, Over the paved way, through the Tanners' Street, Along the quay where murex-fishers press The purple from the sea-shells, at each flight Lending me promise I might stroke the wings Twinned-argent, and perchance capture the prize, The wonder, all of living lustre made. So did it draw me, foolish, blind, bemused, Into the quarter of the slave-market; Then with light beat of pinion soared away T'ward Ishtar's shrine. In ill-content I raised The curtain of the market-entry; there The brokers with their tablets and their scales Sold boys and women for the temple chests, As is the wont. A shaded closure gave Shelter to buyers, and a stage arose, By steps attained, where one by one were set The slaves, the votive maidens, and the spoil Of war or traffic. Loud the clamour was Of wrangling scribes and haggling customers Computing and disputing. Not before Witnessed I this, and had no mood to stay; For the great sea is jealous, and my heart Until that day had followed only her, Knowing not, or but scantly, what new might May spring forth from an eye-glance, and what spells Bind boldest spirits with a touch or tone: And how a woman's hair may hold the soul The storm-rope of a galley could not check. Moreover what the Gods decree will be. For, Mighty Pharaoh! as I turned on heel They lead upon the platform, for vile sale, Undraped, before those buyers clinking gold This oneâthis lady of my life and deeds, Who kneeleth thy veiled handmaid here to-day; Chosen by Ishtar, guardian and guide Of our vast travel, and to bring thee here This day, dread king! the glory never matched Of nether worlds unlocked, Heaven's secrets told: Seeing that it befell at moment when They bared her proud and glorious goodlihood To that coarse crowd, and cried her prices forth, I knew my fate shewn in the queenly face, The eyes, high-couraged mid their pain and shame, The mouth, tender and proud, with lips as red As new pomegranate buds, and teeth as white And even as a row in th' opening corn: In stature a dark Cypress, in her step A free gazelle of the desert, of that throng Mistress and Scorner though the knotted cord Lay shameful on her neck; the master's mark Was set on cloth of Africa she bore, Now rudely reft. Then knew I why the bird Fluttered and fooled me to this selling spotâ A dove of living silver whoe'er saw?â Then knew I that this woman must be mine, Though she cost goldâthough she cost starsâcost life! But not yet knew I how the most wise Gods Had hid their secret in her and bestowed By love my triumph. From long distant springs Whence old Nile flows in lands without a name Captive she came, from royal palace torn In some realm far away, 'neath other starsâ Well nigh another world; by native suns Stamped the soft colour of the ripening date; Skin like the three-plied byssus Sidon weaves; Visage and mien of Princess, born to sway; Of fear and shame and falseness innocent; And speaking speech as gentle as when morn Whispers in palm tops. For she marked me, too, And shot one quick glance from those lustrous orbs; Then, beckoning me, murmured in broken words: âThou, thou, at last, my Lord! Buy me, I pray! Many a night I saw thee in my dreams: Thou art the man of Tyre, strong Ithobal, A master of the sea, and I am thine, Thy servant and thy helper like the sea; I have an errand to thee from the Gods; Buy me, my master, I shall pay thee back!â Thereat astonied, joyous, yet perplexed, I stood with them that bid; and one cried thus, Another thus much more, another more, And yet another most, till one grey lord Tore from his wrinkled neck the chain of sards Carved curious in Egypt, laid in gold, And spake, âSir broker! thou dost put to sale A moon of heaven; 'twere worth an old man's wealth To die on such a bosom; look! I give My chain for gage that I will melt my ships, Three Keels of Tarshish, into what shall pay Ten thousand ounces for thy Nesta there.â Then the beards wagged and baffled dealers drew Forth from the press, while the slave-master said: âThe proffer of Lord EshmÃ»n is well made; A moon from heaven is this rare Libyan girlâ Good market at ten thousand ounces; yet Our Tyrian law forbids we sell a slave Without the leave once to deny herself To owner undesired, if that she find Another to her mind will overpass The topmost offer. Lady, dost thou take Lord EshmÃ»n for thine owner, or wilt name Some other venturer who liketh thee, If such a buyer be?â The girl, at this, Quoth softly, âSell me to Lord Ithobal.â And some waxed wroth, and some laughed scornfully, But I, with angry hand, loosening my hilt, Strode forward of them, and from forth my waist Drew the great pearl and said, âSir broker! ask Thy fellows of the scale what worth holds that Measured in ounces? I do give it thee To buy this maiden.â Then their puckered eyes Hung o'er the milky treasure, and they smote Their breasts and cried, âThis is a wonder-stone; Its like was never seen save on the throat Of Thammuz when he roved with Heav'n's bright Queen, And got for love-gifts certain of the stars. If those three ships ten thousand ounces fetch, Lord EshmÃ»n, this could build as many more; Wilt thou give twenty thousand ounces told, Bidding the Tyrian Captain keep his pearl?â But that grey lord across an evil face Drew his fringed-cloth, departing; and we came, Nesta and I, unto my house in Tyre. In that new air of love, so sweet, so strange, Many days ligged I; and did quite forget My calling, and the calling of the sea; More and more gathering from her honeyed lips What wisdom and what wonders lay behind The brow and breasts of sun-stained ivory: Learning to better know her foreign speech, Which mingled with the language later taught: Sometimes reciting,âhead upon her knees, Or pillowed on her neck,âtales of old Tyre, Of Melkarth's fane, and of high Ashtaroth, The seven great Gods without a name, the loves Of ShadÃ®d and the Moon. Or she would sing Soft songs in unknown cadences, to beat Of snake-skin, or of silver sistrum's thrill, Moving the mind to passion or to peace, As storms and light winds stir the waves. But I Noted no wavesâalbeit our lattice gave Full on the Egyptian harbour, where there came By sunlight, and by stargleam, goodly craftâ Two-banked and three-banked,âmighty ships of war, Girdled with shining shields; and ships of peace Stuffed to their bursting hatches with rich bales Of dyed cloths and of frankincense and gum. Vainly for Ithobal bellied their sails; Their painted flags danced vain against the sky, Their straining rigging creaked, their dripping oars Beat the brine into milk; his playfellows, The barque, the billow, and the boundless marge Pleased him no more; in Nesta's heart he slept, A galley anchored in a land-locked bay. Yet what the Gods ordain that thing will fall. We sat one eve on the cool roof, and watched The Lord of Day go glorious to his bath In gold and purple splendours of the West; And when I said, âI know that path he goes, And something too I know what path he comes From the East desert and its rivers twain; And over black and yellow breeds of men; But no one knows, not Bel's great self I think, The Southward of our world. See!ââand I drew With finger dipped in the spilled Lesbian wine A rude map on the marble bench; âSee! here Sits Egypt; by her side the Sea of Suph, And past that Sea is Punt, which I have viewed, For some do come there making perilous trade; But all beyond is noughtânight, silence, deathâ None knoweth or can know.â She wet with wine A finger, and, with light laugh, featly made A finish to my picture on the stone; Saying âDear honoured lord, but I do know! It is not night, nor death, nor darkness there, But such a land that this thy Syria Counts but for curtilage, and Egypt's self A melon-garden. Where thou shutt'st in Punt, The mighty coast sweeps southward girt with sea, And southward still and southward till you come To mine own country.â Then she murmured forth,â Like a dove cooing never-ending notes Of something sweet and secret in her wood Unfolding leaf by leaf,âstories of skies Whereunder she was born, with stars and peaks Not known to ours; of mighty streams that sprang From mountain bosoms, lifting changeless snows Into the central blue, which, leaping down By monstrous cataract and reeded reach, Full of strange creatures that did swim and fly, And banked by woodlands flowery, wild, and still, Poured over thirsty sands green wealth of crops, Feeding much people. And what seas there were, Wide inland seas shut in the knees of hills, Which held no salted drop and felt no tides, Yet whereupon a well-rowed boat might pass And spy for seven whole days no land at all. Of marvellous tribes she babbled, pigmy folk Mouse-skinned and munching roots; of man-eaters Whose horrid food were what they took in war; Some that went stark as stones; and some that bore Bark dyed like butterflies, or speckled skins, Or pied, or tawny, from the forest won, With ornament fantastic or pierced bone, Coral and cowrie, and rude-spangled bead. Of countless herds she spoke, white goats and black, Kine, wild and gentle, and the long-tailed sheep, And apes like unto men; grim things of the waste Whose names put terror in her tender voiceâ In mine ears meaningless. Also their Kings, What savage state these kept; and of their gods, What images were made in wood and stone, Iron and gold and silver; for she touched The plates of gold tied in her clustering hair And said, âThis groweth there; our daily grain Was dressed in this.â And of the birds she spake; Wonderful birds, like flowers equipped with wings Blazing in blue and gold and rainbow hues; Of serpents that did drag a mottled bulk, Thick as an ox-girth, through the crackling brake, Full thirty cubits long. Of creatures dreamed Only in nightmare, as I thought; sea-cows And river-horses, and a beast that fed With spotted muzzle mid the topmost boughs; Huge pigs that wore horned daggers on the nose, And elephants that went like moving hills Through the affrighted thickets; lions dire, With estridges, their ivory eggs a-heap For suns to hatch, and lizards fathom long, And other brutes which walked in armoured suits Like the mailed men of Elam. For all this A land, she said, fair in some parts as Earth Hath fairest; and with many a race renowned For meekness, friendliness, and courtesy, Mild to the stranger, piteous to the weak; Herself the daughter of a sovereign Puissant in arms, opulent, rich in love, In reverence and worship from his folk, Far, far beyond that marble edge whereto She drew the willing wine: from whose kind throne, Torn in her childhood by a treachery, She had become a wanderer, and mine. O King! if thou hast seen thy Nile pour down At rain-break, rushing o'er his stones to the sea; If thou hast seen on Suph the summer flood Come home in foam and freshets to each gulf When the great South wind roars; so did my heart, Which is thy servant, once more burn for the beach As this dusk teacher opened wide the doors, And showed me where to look for that which crowns Even thyself with glory. Since she said,â Whenever in that journey of her lips I stayed and questioned her, âYea, there and there We saw the sea; no mountain-margined pool But Kneph's own water dreadful, shining, wide, Rolling its billows southward, northward still, How far our farthest coast men answer not.â What the high Gods will have falls at its hour; For, sitting at the lattice with new eyes, Awake from love and seeing clear again, So that once more the ships were friends to me, The noise of rowers' music, the sea's voice Under those white walls full of private words; There came, great Pharaoh! messengers from thee, Egyptians of thy household, men of worth, Envoys to Tyre. We heard a herald blow His conch-shell, and the cymbals played, and one From a papyrus spake these words aloud In hearing of the town: âTo friendly men, To mariners of Tyre, the lord of lords, The Pharaoh ruling over Misraim, Sendeth goodwill and greeting. He hath need Of sailors for a thing he hath to do, A voyage of ships, full perilous, but full Of guerdon in the going, and of more In the returning, if there hap return; Since these ships sail for harbours never seen. Well known ye are, of Tyre and Sidon sons, For craft upon the waters; if there be Those that fear danger less than they hate sloth, Those seasoned with the salt, who will take wage And service with the Pharaoh for this work, Let them ask service.â And with this was flung Largesse among the folk, yet no man stirred. Outspake an ancient one, from Ascalon âYe men of Tyre take heed! Three winters past Across the brook of Egypt I and some Wended with camels, and came thither where The east horn of the Lord of Egypt's Sea Juts green into the Stony Land; we saw Along the shore three crosses; on them hung What of three men the kites and crows had leftâ Dried skull, and skin, and bones. âWhat wrought these ones,â We asked, âthat they should moulder in the sun?â And the folks said: âThese are three officers Conspired against the peace of Pharaoh; he Willing to spare their lives bade them take ship And sail and sail over past utmost bound To fetch him secrets from the dark; but they After ten moons of travel clapped on wing Of homeward voyage. Reaching home they cried:â âBetter to die than bear what we have borne Fronting the frightful perils of yon world Which hath a death on every wave, a hell At every cape. Kill us, but send not there.ââ And Pharaoh paid their wages, slaying them.â But Nesta bent upon me those dark eyes, Deep as the sea, and spake, âThis is for thee, Ithobal, son of Magon, lord and lover, The Gods do bring thy heart and wish in one. Rise and make parley with these men of Nile; It is thy work, and I shall help thy work; Thou art the man they seek.â And while she spake The silver dove of Ishtar fluttered in, Perched at my elbow, cooed a dulcet note, Then darted seaward with a singing wing In token that the Gods would have their will. But when they said in Tyre âIthobal goes In service of the Pharaoh to build ships, Which shall at Pharaoh's charge sail the dark seas Nether of nethermost and past the bounds Where boldest oar hath dipped,â the white town poured All its sea-people round me, for 'tis known How multitudinous Tyre sits on the wave, And what throngs, many-coloured, swarm her quays, Doing the business of the waters. There Were traders from the isles loud-trafficking With such as brought by weary caravan Fir boards and cedar out of Lebanon; And patient shapers of the bladed oar Bargaining for Bashan oak and ivory To edge the rowing benches; Chittim men, Swarthy and watchful, and the Ashurites, And those that traded linen, white and blue Or bordered, to make sails; sea wolves sun-tanned From Sidon and from Arvad; mixed with these The wise grey master-pilots of the place, Quick to catch tidings, knowing all the seas, But beating on their breasts at word of this; Caulkers from Gebal, wotting well to keep Seams tight and hulls wave-worthy; companies Of shipmen come from Elam, Lud and Phut; Merchants and fighting folk busy with bales, Or cleaning shields, or pointing arrow-heads, Or fitting spears with new-forged blades; those called The Gemmadin, with sturdy cargoers Of Tarshish, Javan, Meshech, clamorous they To sell their slaves and vaunt their brazen ware. Togharmah dealers drew into our throng Lean, keen-eyed, desert-born, leading their strings Of mules and horses; and from Dedan those Who bring the tusks of elephant, the myrrh, The ebony, and gum. Swart Syrians Bartering for cloths of Tyre stained by the shell Their emeralds, corals, agates; bearded Jews Selling their wheat from Minnith, honey, oil, And balm of Pannag; and Damascus-breds Plying their business with white bleachÃ«d wools, And wines of Helbon: with such come from Dan Who sold bright iron, cassia, calamus, Cushions for chariots: tribesmen from the sands Of Araby with lambs and rams, and shawls Of camel-hair for tents; and Raamah sent, And Sheba, coffers filled with subtle spice Fine stones, turkis and sard and lazuli And powdered gold. Haran and Canneh there Put forth their stores of blue and 'broidered work And chests of rich apparel, bound with cords On scented cedar. All the noise of these, The singing of the sailors, and the cries Of sellers, and the stir of the bazaar, The dance-girls, the snake-charmers, drum-players, The fortune-tellers, minstrels, priests that begged Alms for the templesâall broke off and heard All stayed and listened, and drew nigh to us Along the water-face of Tyre that eve, Knowing of Ithobal and how he took Service with Pharaoh, with my lord the King. Also at parting there was sacrifice To those who rule the sea,âthe Fish-tailed God And the Twin Stars and the Seven Nameless Ones. But when in Ishtar's fane they brought to slay Two boys of Africa limbed like young deer, Soft-voiced but speaking most with wistful eyes, Whom the grey priests that go her altar round Would offer for the speeding of our voyage, 'Twas Lady Nesta drew the knife away From the stretched hands and cut the bonds of those, Handah and Gondah, saying âTake the price In sheep or camel for the thing ye do; My lord and I did trace the journey's plan With wine, not blood, and so will follow it, Bloodless, if this may be, since pity comes To those that pity.â And behold those here Safe and most faithful among faithful found. END OF THE FIRST DAY. THE SECOND DAY Ithobal, Magon's son, of Tyre Hath comfort for his heart's desire; He builds in Egypt galleys three To sail unto the unknown Sea. May the King live for ever! By thy soul; By thy magnificence and majesty; Not less than such a treasure-house as thine, No bounty meaner than great Pharaoh's grace, No hand less open, and no weaker heart Than thine, O Lord of Lords! had plenitude For charges of this high emprize. Our Tyre, With all her pride, her merchants bold and keen, Her ships shut off into the Midland sea, Her sailors fearless and her pilots wise Held no heart for the task sore tempting her. Thy kingly wish it was, thy kingly word, Thy largesse, broad and fertile as the Nile, Called me to be thy captive, and bestowed With godlike power the means to work thy will; And bring thee, as I bring, thy biddings done. Nigh fifty moons agoneâthou knowest, Lord! Before thy throne I kneeled in this same hall And heard thy word, how thine Egyptians brought Tales whispered from the stillness of the South Of lands outside known land, and wash of seas Beyond heard waters where, what seemed to stand The edge of the Earth, might haply stretch afar, Might haply keep in darkness some new light, In silence some strange voice, in the will of the Gods Some golden secrets held for hardihood: And how that darkness vexed thy royal soul; And how that silence teased thee, and the thought Though thou were Lord of Nile and did'st command Suph and her shores, there might be territory, Goodly to gain, and spread of sovereignty, And godlike deeds to do, if one knew where. And saying, âThus much wot we,â thou didst bid Thy scribes unroll the painted skins that shewed The sea lines and the land lines where they stayed. Then I, who had sailed boldest of my time, Marked, at thy mandate, to what spot I went Farthest of far. And when thou saidst to me âWhat is yet farther, and how might we reach To tear the truth from Kneph?â humbly I gave Reply and spake: âKneph and the mighty Gods Alone know this: yet if a King should grant Gold and the gifts to build three stalwart ships Here on thy sea; and freight them full of gear; And fit them in such wise to mock at storms; And man them with picked companies enured To close obedience and contempt of fate, With rowers seasoned to the labouring oar, And watchful timoneers, and men-at-arms Chosen for bravest; I, tried sailor here, Ithobal, son of Magon, at his word Would from the silent gods their secret pluck Or leave my life where I did lose his ships.â Then, mighty Pharaoh! thou didst answer me, âBuild me those ships on these my waters here; Build at what cost thou wilt to make them stout, As if the beams were of red gold, and decks Of planished silver. Stuff them with such gear As largest forethought asks. Fill them with store Of all thy longest travel could demand. Hire me from Tyre or Sidon, whence thou wilt, Picked mariners and skilful timoneers And valiant men-at-arms who know thy flag, And will not dread to follow where it flies. Thou art of Pharaoh's service, Ithobal, From this day's noon; and ye, chief councillors, Put a red robe of honour on this man; Give him a guard; and wearing this my ring, Command my overseers, treasurers, Store-keepers, officers, artificers, To grant all asked, of timbers, leathers, brass, Victuals, and viands, honey, grain and oil, Fulfilling what he will.â So spakest thou, Most royal master, lordliest of all lords! Thus did I build and build. A windless creek Turns hither from the western horn of Suphâ Which hath two horns upon the northern end Of thy Red Waterâturns to 'Ataka. Broad yellow sands athwart the green waves look To Moosa's Fountain, and grey mountains piled, Peaks which take morning first, and rosy crags That see the last of sunset over Cush. There did we choose a spot with easy slope To the dimpled inlet, and good underground To take the cradles, while to that same place, Moon after moon, thy bounty brought to me Food for the toil; acacia wood, palm logs, Sont, and, for stubborn knee-pieces and bends, Grey iron-bark; also from Lebanon By raft or caravan fair cedar planks, Trimmed to fine edge, and pine-tree poles to make Masts, and for benches lengths of sycamore, With oak and ash for oars, and iron clamps To knit the joints, and nails of bronze to bind Timber to timber. And with these things came Mechanics out of Tarshish, Sidon, Tyre, Cunning to wield the mallet and the adze; Carpenters, skilled to dovetail to a hair; Smiths, who knew well with hammer and with tongs To bend the brass taking their will like wax. These came with sawyers, caulkers, sailmakers, And those deep-crafty the green hides to twist In cord and cable; or from hair and flax Halyard and brace to braid; chiefs of the band, The master-builders with their compasses And reed-pens marking measurements, most shrewd To note if any faulty baulk or knot Creep with the sound stuff midst our goodly gear And at some pinch bewray us. Succoured thus, Well did our building fare by edge of sea. Three ships we planned to build,âbiremes,âto bulk Large for our stores and sailors; not too large To take the shore at need and deftly pass Inside the reefs, by narrow channel ways, When seas were angry. Ships that in the calm Might lightly wend with measured stress of oars, Or, if fair winds did blow, sea-worthy spread Their painted wings. The first, of my command, Should be The Silver Dove; in length t'was schemed Sixty-five cubits, and in beam eleven; Row-seats, of under deck fifteen a-side Of upper row-seats, to the right and left, Two-score. Forward and afterward, strong built, Cabins enclosed; and round her sides a run Of gallery, where mariners should work Nor foul the oarsmen. In the foremost part, A mast of pine with laddered shrouds, well-stayed; And knitted linen sails, wide for light airs, Scanty for blustering breezes; oar-ports carved For seventy blades. Under the Thalamites,â The lower rowers,âgoodly space should stretch Where stores would lie, and waste sea-water drain, And the fair ship at need take ballast in. Light must she be for hauling; strong for shocks, Ample to house her company: this ship Was mine and Lady Nesta's with the best Gathered about us for the enterprise: No slave band straining sullen at the looms, But free men of the sea, good at the oar, Good at the tackle, good at need with spear Or sling or bow: tried mariners whereof Hanno the Carchedonian, under me, Had mastership; comrade in bygone days. Built like to this, but of bulk scantier, Was Ram of Kneph with fifty rowing men, Hiram of Tyre her captain: joined with him My sister's son, Hamilcar. Last and third, The Black Whale whereupon Nimroud did rule With SothÃ«s the Egyptian. She should bear Forty stout oars and be provision craft, Close stuffed with goods and gear and merchandise. These did we fashion as a man doth frame That which life hangs on and the ends of life, Not matching board nor morticing a beam Save, mighty King, as if the eye of Thoth Noted our labouring, to spare or slay As each one's duty went into the work. We laid false keels dressed out of stubborn stuff, From stem to stem, to take the slippery sand, The grinding shelf: bolted and fanged them home Into the solid keels; and over those, The kelsons moulded into one with them: Atop of all false kelsons, where the feet Of the masts stood fast. Across them and across Bolted the sister-beams; built up the ribs; Worked in the elbow-pieces and the knees; Braced them with tough ties; wedged the transomends; Drove home the deck supports; and covered in The hollow wombs of these with bedded planks, Doubled below; and every seam and joint Nicely with pitch sealed in and palm fibres. In all their sides we cut the ports for oars Rimmed and well rounded; and to every port The leathern sleeve true fixed, lest the rude sea Break through upon the rowers. When 'twas wrought, And the three goodly ships lay trim and strong,â Sea-things that took a life from shape and sheen, And seemed like Ocean's children, keen to dip Their breasts in the flood,âwe stepped the masts in each; Set up the standing tackle; hoisted yards; Fitted abaft the two great oars that steer; Bedecked each hull in colours glad and gay, Reddening the prows and painting bold and bright Each vessel's eyes, where the wide binding boards Drew fine into the stem, fair-finishing With each craft's emblem; mine a silver dove, Ishtar's bright signâto keep the Goddess oursâ And on The Ram of Kneph, the Lord of waves, Figured in brass and ivory, for guide Of Hanno's crew. But Hiram had for his A great whale spouting, carved in ebony. We launched them light, not straining the new hulls Till seams should tighten, soaked; and all defaults Show plain. But like sea-nymphs born for the brine, Comely, defectless on the flood they sate. Next, ship by ship, we laded, tier on tier Stowing our merchandise; the cloth, the beads, The wares wild people love, spare goods and gear, And over these in tall red jars the grain; Flour for the ship-cakes, honey, oil, pulse, meal, Dried fish, and rice, and salted goods. Nor wine Was lacking; seasoning herbs and kitchen stuff; Nor camel-cheese, nor dates. The water-pots At each port we should fill. Phoenician hands Well know to pack a hold, wasting small space. All lay in order; each man had his niche. Afterwards in full council I unfold How we shall voyage. This near sea is known. Ishtar's bright bird on prow of Ithobal Safely will wing her way from point to point, From reef to reef, on western shore of Suph; From Klysma to Greek Harbour; by Kosseir; Under the emerald mount and 'Ataka; Down past Aidhab, and where the hills of Kus Shut off the sinking sun, till we attain, Four hundred leagues from this, past many isles, An island green and grey. The black rocks jag Its lonely steeps; on this side and on that The sea frets in a narrow passaging, All day and night making its moan; for there Is âGate of Lamentation,â whence we pass, By this hand or by that, out from those seas That bear a name. Thus far 'tis training time; We and our vessels will become acquaint. And thus far shall these three, The Silver Dove, The Ram and Whale securely wend: by day, If North wind favours, spreading square sails wide; If no wind blows over the poop, with oars; By night reposing, when the sea rolls strong, On shore well chosen; if the sea be still, At anchor; save if Ishtar's kindly moon Shine and 'tis good to make a night a day, Lessening the leagues, and leagues and leagues to come. Moreover for the slow the swift must wait, Or by clear signals lead to meeting-place; Best safety will still lie in fellowship. We set for each the watches; such an hour For toil, and such for food; at such an hour Due worship to the gods; and then at such To cleanse each ship, and broken gear refit, And bale the holds, and grease the rowing-ports. Also, by signs made, when to take the land, And how to beach, and how to set a guard; And who should search the fountains out, and fill The water-pots; and who make friendly parle With native people, opening markets so; And what was good to buy and just to give. Twas common lore of mariners how Suph Sleeps in a tideless bed, nor feels that moon Which at her full draws the wide waters up, And at her dark half drops them. Thy Red Sea, Great Pharaoh! belting in all Misraim here, By no streams fed, bordered by burning sands Or sun-baked mountains, sucks the ocean in To give it forth again in mist and dew: So, if one lay his ship upon a beach, No certain flood will come to lift her off, As otherwhere: but if the wind blow strong This way or that a current runs will raise The waters to two cubits or to three. Well-nigh through all the year a North-West creams The blue with silver; it shall fill our sails Dawn after dawn till at the ninth moon's endâ Two moons from setting forthâwe reach that isle Baulking the Southern breeze, would hold us back; Albeit as ye pass outside, by then, The season mellows and the soft monsoonâ Prayed for of Arab sailorsâbreathing mild Out of the white North-West, shall waft us on Whither I know not, nor its winds nor tides. Followed brave days; the North wind filled our sails, The green sea glittered under 'Ataka, Then, deepening, changed to blue, and sparkled bright In spume and long-laced breaker, where reef edge Breasted its roll. A good day's travel doneâ Sufficeth if we finish fifteen leagues With sheet and bladeâat dark we find some nook Of favouring shoal or friendly promontory, Where my three ships could sleep safe moored, or rest Aground. Then some on shore-lit cooking fires; And some spread nets to catch the finny food; And some adventured into thickets near For fuel, or what game might be afoot, Or fruits and gums and herbs. Glad they did stretch Limbs cramped from shipboard on the dry clean sand, Or chase with bow in hand the shy gazelle; Or barter with the wild-eyed villagers; To some all strange, but not to Nesta here, My Lady of the Land, who knew its faceâ As daughter knows the mother's eyes and lipsâ And knew its flowers and trees, and why they grew, And which were good and evil. Nay, one eve This spacious deed had in beginning died But for my lady. On the beach we paced, The sun being just gone down, and heedlessly I set my sandal on some mouldering bark: Forth from the crackle slipped a hooded asp Which stung and stung again. I mocked at the worm: But Nesta, sweet orbs wideâlips drawnâteeth setâ Clutched me and cried, âThou hast three hours to live, Dear lord, except I find the serpent-root In some near brake.â Then, stooping first, she sucked Those two small wounds, and spitting on the sand, Ran to the thicket; presently returned, Some plant in hand which had a whitish leaf, With prickles, and the blossom like a snake; Of this she chews and chews, binds leaf and root Over the limb; then from her bosom draws Some sacred thing curiously wrought in gold, Which helped her at her prayers, and clasping that, Pillowed my hot brows on her gentle knees. I had much thirst; meseems I nearly swooned, But woke unharmed with Nesta watching near. But, âMaster dear!â she said, â'twas an ill worm! Nought could have saved thee if my leaf saved not And Nesta's faithful lips; oh! an ill worm!â In midst of Suph ere yet the season breaks, Between the winds a belt of calm will stretch Under that burning arch of day, those nights Spangled with stars. There idle hangs the sail, Dead drops the useless pennon at mast-head; From the deck-seams oozes the pitch, the planks Burn the bared foot; the sea smokes in the sun, And in its hot and oily glass there swim Strange shapes that love the warm brine and the calm: Water snakes, green and gold, or ringed, or pied, Or mottled, like a pard, yellow and black; Some with sharp muzzle, some with foul flat heads And fiendish eyes; then monstrous sea-jellies, Purple, and russet, silvery grey and pink, With filmy oars and mouths which ope and close, Pant their slow passage through the salt. Soon comes Amidst them, as a ship through bladder-wrack, The great grey robber-shark, his black fin hoist, Like pirate's sail, and slimy belly of pearl; A spear-blade gleaming as it cuts the blue. The little fishes fly, save one bold sort Striped motley, with long snout, which is the slave And lick-plate of the shark, seeking for him Food, that the little fish may leavings eat; No shark so hungry that will swallow him. Along the heaving hyaline there lie Ropes of thick sea-grass, yellow, black, and red, Torn by the teeth of storms from ledge awash Along the coast; if we shall nearly look, A thousand myriad little mariners Die on that drifting wreck, small shell-fishes Who made their tiny houses beautiful; Strange creatures, like sea blossoms having lips On every leaf, that built upon the rock, And, like poor mortals, thought their world would last; Now drive they outcast with their broken house. Oft spake we, she and I, of this strange strife By the high Gods decreed 'twixt life and death, Where living to be slain we slay to live, And all which Isis gives Amenti takes. By the Seven Nameless Ones! she said a word Wise to my mind, one morning, while we rowed Nigh âThe Two Brothersâ in the belt of calm. Beneath that windless morning on the waves A flock of sea-fowl seated wide and far Made the sea white; for leagues and leagues they rocked On the smooth sob o' the deep, screaming for joy Of living and the lust of prey. I spake:â âSee yonder gluttons of the wing and beak! How glad and fair, yet are they murderers Who spy huge shoals of homely guiltless fish Hastening to spawn, and circumvent them here, And swallow at a gulp mother and seed, Father and milt; for one day of bird life Destroying thirty myriad lives of fish! Shall this be justice here? hath Thoth known all? God Melcar, and Queen Ishtar and Great Bel?â But reverently she fetched her fetish forth And laid it to her lips, and murmured, âLord! To see the ways of Gods await new eyes.â Then fell the rain storms: where the sister winds From North and South bring their black cloud-wracks up, These meet and break their sullen swollen wombs With thunder and with lightning. O'er the sea Wasted sweet water pelts, beats down the crests Of billows that would rise, makes dry rocks ring With patter of the cataracts, and paints The barren valleys green. But we, aware Of tempests in the middle waters, hug The friendly shore, skirting with shallow keels And cunning stress of oars, where the gaps come, From cape to cape. One night, in the ninth moon, The Ram, making for beachâthe sea being fullâ Took ground on lip of ledge, and shore away Her hither bilge-piece. When the dawn did break She hangs there, perilous. We lighten her; We take off what we may of store and gear; Fling overboard what might be spared; with pole And rope put strain to free her, for she grinds But by the counter: yet all's nought! the tide Swells near its topmost: then doth Hiram take His stoutest cable shoreward, kept a-dry, Braces it twainfold three palm stems around; Strains the great cord to breaking; yet all's nought! Till, at the nick, when most the tide wave lifts, And most the Ram doth tremble, Hiram cries, âWater unto the cord!â Young Hamilcar Drenches the hawser; the wet fibres knit Closer by half a span; the cable cracks, But the good ship swings free and comes to peace On quiet sands. Now must we find afield Timber to mend Kneph's barque. Yet here grow not The forest trees would fit our purposes; Sont only, and the Doun, and stunted thorns. Nathless, over the plain at foot of hills That to a highland climb by terraces, A belt of woodland darkens, green and long, Whereto with spears and axes and a band Of willing men we make a march. I go With Lady Nesta and the Egyptian slaves, Handah and Gondah. Since that day the knife Was taken from their necks at Nesta's word, These had been steadfast to her service, guards Watching her steps and shadowing all her walks. An open rolling plain it was that sloped By rock and sand-hill and a world of thorns To uplands with mimosa groves and mounds By the wise ants built; oh! a lonely land, Save for the ring-doves and some speckled hens Which ran and cackled in the brake, and herds Of silk-skinned antelopes. There, mighty King, First did I view that creature of the waste Which hath two horns upon his snout, and tail Swine-like, and armoured plates like Gammadim, Eyes of the pig, and body of the steer; Surely in sport the high Gods fashioned it. For, as we bore our beam forth from the wood, The wild thing burst upon us, scattering all, And Nesta said âIncomba, Master, heed! This is the white horned beast of Africa Which is to dread: stand still until he charge, But when he sinks his muzzle to the ground, Step swiftly right or left, he will not see.â But while it came upon us Gondah's spear Ham-strung the beast and when it wallowed prone, The blade of Handah found its heart and slew So were we quit, and good meat made that foe, Carved in long strips and slow-dried in the sun. Then patched we Hiram's vessel where the ledge Tore her bilge bare. It was a seasoned balk Shred by the lightning from a forest-king, Untouched by worm, mended my stout Ram's side. So speed we thence with south-wind, gusts, and rain, And then, anew, calm seas whereon my crews By this stage fitly trained, would emulate, One flag against the other, ship with ship Racing for joy of manhood and free waves. With three-score blades and ten The Silver Dove Held easy mastership. The Ram and Whale More equal courses ran, and good to view On such gay days the oars play to the tunes Of flute and drum-skin sounded from bench-footâ Zeugite and Thalamiteâabove, below, Keeping one pulse and cutting clean the blue To toss it, creamy foam and bubbles back Along the whitened pathway of each keel, Where in our wakes the glistening dolphins danced. Thus southward, southward came we, sometimes held Captive in bay or inlet by ill winds; Sometimes much threatened of the coast people. But we were strong and watchful; if ashore We pitched a camp, the place was circled in With thorny boughs and tree-roots and a fosse. All down unto the isle, of mariners Two only had we lost; some beast by night Dragged one asleep into the dark; and one Died of a calenture: that which is writ Is writ within the book of each man's life. In the tenth moon we sailed out of that sea: There the great ocean opened; East and South The unknown world which, Pharaoh! now is thine By lordly primal right. East and to North I myself wotted of a port secure Into bare calcined hills gave entrance good,â Shamshan they name the mountainâand the town Which, in a cup of burnt-out fire-mount, sleeps Attanoe. Aden. From the isle one day and night With steadfast oars and favouring breath of breeze Moored thy ships, Majesty of Egypt! safe. It is a friendly people; from their wells Hewn in the rock, we filled sweet water up; Bought palm fruit and great cream-white Estridge-eggsâ For three men sharp-set one doth make a mealâ With millet-flour and oil of olive trees; But mainly water; for my purpose heldâ Unspoken save to Nesta and the chiefsâ Bold to put forth into that eastward blue Which had no shore I knew, nor place of rest, Nor help for thirst, nor food for emptiness, Nor shield from storm and death, till we should pass Full seven-score leagues of naked waves, and view A great cliff rise out of that nameless seaâ So said the coast folkâand they called that cliff East Horn of the Large Land where none hath come. END OF THE SECOND DAY THE THIRD DAY Ithobal, pushing o'er the main, Reacheth a shore with stress and pain; Strange men and birds and beasts hath seen, And winneth where no man had been. Glory, and life, and grace from the high Gods Unto Great Pharaoh! From the Arabian Shore At end of the ninth moon we pushed to sea: The Ram, The Black Whale, and The Silver Dove, Thy ships, a goodly triplet rigged afresh, Well filled and fitted; for my purpose held To trust the deep and to be done with land, Till on the gulf's far coastâif coast there be, As the sea people thinkâwe touch a cape East of the mainland, if mainland there hap. So had I charged the water-pots and crammed Our jars with meal and feasted full my crews, To hearten up their manhood; yet none knew Except the captains and my lady here How to the winds and waves we gave our souls; What trackless seas we clove quitting that port With merry plash of oars, and steering straight Where none did steer before. At setting forth Nesta bade bring aboard of merchandiseâ Or so I deemedâa score of bales, and laid The goodsâI thought for barterâin the poop, Where her sea-chamber stood. The sky was blue, The sun beamed glad, the silver-broidered waves Lisped pleasant music, and there breathed a wind,â Spiced with the myrrh and aloes of the hills,â Which tripped our swiftest blades and drove our beaks Deep in the dancing green. But when it fell, And right abaft us in the lonely gulf The sun dipped, all aflame with gold and pearl, Burning the brine, the lusty rowers changed Tired arms for fresh, and all that still night through, And all next dawn to noon, and after noon, Until again the sun gilded the west, Watches, by watches, they did toil. But Kneph Had missed a sacrifice, or Ishtar's lamp Gone rashly scant of oil; for while 'twas dark, At breaking of fourth day the morning star Went out behind black clouds, and a foul wind Drove leaping seas into our rowing ports, And drenched each deck-bench. Valorously the flute And drum kept measure; valorously the oars Swung to the rowing song from ship to ship; Yet how shall mortal strength resist the might Of the angry Gods? All that long, heavy day We did not win a ship's length, and the next Hardly three leagues. Afterwards fell a calm; A brazen sky arched o'er a seething sea; A blaze of Dawn and Noon and Afternoon Parching my patient comrades. By the blood Of Thammuz! all my drinking water spent, My men a-dry and that shore still not near, Meseemed that we were lost in the outsetting. Came the ninth day whereat a hard wind blew Foul from the Eastward weakening what we did,â Too weak already. Nimroud drew his ship Abreast of mine; the oars clashed and our sides Rasped with the swell. The Syrian captain sprang Insolent on my deckâan angry band Of bearded faces round him. Heretofore Thrice had I chided him for hests forgot And deeds undisciplined. Rebellion burned Desperate in his eyes: âThou Magon's son Hast brought us here to perish; one day's drink Remaineth, and thy fabled shore comes not. Send my poor rowers water; if thou wilt, Steer thyself onward to thy realm of dreams, But give us of thy store and suffer us To go back westward with the favouring wind; Port may be reached, and those thou slayest saved.â Thirsty and lean my oarsmen gazed on him, Half pleased to hear, half glad to disobey. One little spark may breed a mighty fire; Their hearts were dry for flame. Shall this be end Of Pharaoh's hope? I mused; shall my Lord's will Wreck on one coward's raving? From his hand I wrested Nimroud's spear, drove its broad blade Deep in the traitor's breast; stone-dead he fell Amid the oar-looms on the reddened deck; And all the ship-folk and the rowers glared, And the sea idly played, tangling our oars. Then cried I, âFling yon carrion overboard; He dies who disobeys; to your benches, men!â Yet in my secret heart sorrow kept seat. How make the land with dying mariners? Had Nimroud reason? was it well to yield? Then, at my worst, did Lady Nesta lay Her hand on mine, and with the other point Southward of east where from the mingling lines Of sea and sky there rose a ruddy speck Touched by the morning, like the golden grain Upon a lotus leaf. She murmured âLand! There is thy shoreâand mine!â A mighty joy Flooded this heart. âThou daughter of the Sun, May the Seven Nameless Ones yield thee for this! That is my shoreâand thine; yet if we row, These cannot follow since their jars are dry; In sight of prize we perish.â âNay! dear lord,â Quoth Lady Nesta, âgive to Ram and Whale What drink we have, and bid them follow up, While I do break for Ishtar's ship these bales Laid in my cabin; twenty bales of fruit New to thine eyes. An unseen fruit it grows In the Arab vales; 'tis the gold apple, kept By dragons, people tell, in guarded groves; I knew and bought. I did foresee this strait. I feared to failâperchance at winning-point. Dread not! Give them the water, and to ours These juicy globes distribute; bid them eat, Then stoutly man their oars, for the wind drops And 'tis from westward now the current sweeps. By night we will be underneath yon hill. And fill the water jars.â Yea! so it fell; The Silver Dove gave to the thirsty ones What drink she had; the luscious fruit was sucked, Brightening all faces, strengthening all throats So that my seventy sang in frolic time To music of the flute-player and the drum; And, by the night, look! we had touched a beach So sheltered that the sea did kiss it smooth With tender ripples, and a stream came down Out of a hanging wood, whence we did drink And drink, and drink, and thank the Gods for life. We beached below the Cape; Cape Guardafui. a mighty rock Wheat-coloured, hath a sanded bay at foot, In shore a sandy hill; its height I deem Five hundred cubits; riseth from the sea Wall-like with sloping cap. Coasting along We skirt a yellow shore; mimosa trees Marked where a stream stole out; then, past the sands, Dark broken rocks, and one brown cliff that sets His foot i' the waves and lifts his brow to clouds, ShenÃ¢rif, so the fisher-people said. After wards long low beaches, backed with bush; Next that, an inland range wherefrom juts forth A crag over the breakers. Farther on Fresh flats of sand, and pools behind the sand Noisy with sea-fowl; birds that swim and wade, Long-legged and long-beaked birds, storks, pelicans, Rose-plumed flamingoes, bitterns, cormorants, Tribes of the web and wing. To landward end A stream flows down, for sake of which the folk Had built their huts and many gardens round, Whom first we frighted. Never yet to them Had come such strangers nor been viewed before Garments of Egypt, or the Tyrian coats, Or vessels many-legged like water-flies. Dark hued they were, naked, or basely clad With belt or plaited leaves, or bark of tree, Their hair all shagged, dyed red. Not Nesta knew Not Handah and not Gondah what these cried Answering our words when we did woo them back From flight to make a marketing. Yet mild, Peaceful of mien, dwelling in houses small But trim and comely. Soâin need of foodâ At bidding of my lady, no men touched Ripe dates or millet hoarded, but we laid For each ship's want a motley barter downâ Cloth, and bright beads, and brass and iron bladesâ Wares which they crave; by every heap was placed A stake wherefrom there swung the thing we lacked A fruit, some grain, meat, or a butter pot. This done in their full sight: then would we leave The barter heaps a-row and stand aloof Whilst our barbarians, returning soon Meted the stuff, and laid by every pile The goods which they would give in equal worth. Then they withdrew, and ours, gone up again Accepting what was fair bore that away; What seemed not equal we did leave untouched, They adding more and more to make all just Till both were pleased and both went full away: The silent market ended. Coasting on, In three days from the cape we reach HafÃ»n The âWave-surrounded.â 'Tis a neck of land Four leagues along and two full leagues athwart, Broken with hillocks, edged by beaches flat, And to the mainland tied by slender thread Of silvery dunes. This doth good shelter give Or here or there whichever wind do blow To fisher-folk whoâfor the fish aboundâ Drag their rude shallops to this side or that. Myself, because the north-east wind blew strong Bade SothÃ«s, Hanno, and wise Hiram row Round the long neck to where a little bay Lent certain peace. There did we cast our nets And took much finny food, but the great sharks Would ofttimes break our gear: the negro boys, Handah and Gondah, taught our Tyrians To slice their fins and dry them in the sun For broths, since out of evil cometh good. âWhere goes my lord?â the friendly people asked; And I, âWe go as far as the sun goes: As far as the sea rolls; as far as stars Shine still in sky; though they be unknown stars.â Then they, âWhat seeks my lord?â I gave reply, âTo find for mighty Pharaoh what his world Holds hidden.â But they did not know thy name Great King! and softly laughed, and said âWho hunts What the Gods hide hath trouble for his pay. Many have gone thy way, and some came back, But lean, and grey, and broken; and they told Of savage men, and dreadful suns, and wastes Where snake and lizard die o' the scorch, and where The shadow of a man at high noon falls Between his feet unseen. And if there lay Some pool under a rock, if some stream flowed With welcome water, all the beasts around Sniffed it, and stamped it foul, and sucked it dry; While lions prowled and roared.â âNay but we go,â I answered, â'tis commanded.â Then they spake Pointing black fingers west of south, âGo then! But keep thy ships aloof from Mabbar thereâ We name it âStand-off Pointââlest a storm break And trap thy vessels in the stony bay.â But Ishtar favoured, and thy Gods, O King!â Soft o'er the wooded neck a morning wind Bellied our sails; a cloudless sun arose Turning to gold the Dove upon my stem; To gold the milk of the waves, to gold the foam Flung from our oars, whichâbank by bankâmade play As those three keels raced gaily. At moon-rise We saw the pale surf fretting round the head Thrusting and thundering into cave and cleft With echoing moans, and hiss of shingle dragged: By Isis! 'twas a place to break a ship With a ship's company! But we sailed wide, Holding the friendly breeze, and all that night And all next dayâday of the eleventh moonâ Merrily sped the Dove, and Ram, and Whale; My lusty oarsmen drowsing in the sun; The drum and flute at peace or striking up For frolic dance. In the warm air was taste Of life, and joy, and hope, grown breathable. Then did I know, dread King!âmy painted sails So filled, my lady's hair blown for a sign Straight onward, and the faces of my men Set to the look of such as fear no moreâ Then knew I that we should not fail. The barks Danced till the sun set down a rugged shore Where ran a wall of rock, till with last gleam We spy a red cliff; on this hand and that A saffron-tinted pinnacle; behind A darkish round-capped hill. From forth a gorge A river rills to sea; about its mouth Huts cluster of the shore folk. After parle By sign and broken speech, we make fair friends, Let fall the sails, and beach. In the dry time, This stream, the people said, scanted and thin, Hath hardly flood enough to brim its bar; But now we filled our jars at the sea's edge. Around my ships, under a grove of palms, A fence was fixed, by forty spearmen kept; But we had peace. Soon, from the mountain gorge, A caravan appears of inland folk: Swart merchants clad in bark, rude fighting bands, With shields of hide, and knives, and knotted clubs; Slaves with the yoke-wood on their necks, and trains Of laden oxen, camels, horses, eke, A breed not seen before; marvellous steeds Striped as a melon is, all black and white: Flanks, muzzles, necks, and hams, pencilled and pied Like a silk cloth of SaÃ¯s; these they said Ran wild behind the hills, but being broke Made gentle drudges. Goes a road, they told, Into the land, whereby these traffickers Wend and return, bringing their country stuff, And taking back what wares the coast affords. An easy path, they said, by Nogal vale, Well watered and the forests dark and cool, Whence we might pass, if we did will to pass To certain goodly game-lands in the hills Where, for the hunting, meat in plenty roved. Soâlacking meatâwith twenty chosen men And porters of the village; Hamilcar And I, with Nesta, kept the company Of the home-going merchants. First a cleft Where the pent river fretted in its rocks Glittering to light 'mid dripping ferns and fronds, And diving into darkness where the path O'erhung its bed. So marched we half a day While the stream sang cool music in our ears; And then beyond the pass a wood; great treesâ Their boles, O Pharaoh! bigger than the shafts Which front thy palace,âand with buttressed roots Grew over dark green solitudes, and raised A leafy roof that noon's sun might not pierce. No undergrowth, no grass, no blooms,âfor those We saw the butterflies:âby Isis! lord! Thou had'st not missed the flag-flower, or the lote, The blood-red granate-bud or palm blossom Nor all thine Egypt's gardens, viewing there What burning brilliance danced on double wings From stem to stem, or lighted on the leaves Blotting the grey and brown with lovely blaze Of crimsons, silver-spotted, summer blues By gold fringe bordered, and gemmed ornament Alight with living lustre. One, all pale, The colour of the sunrise when pearl clouds Take their first flush; one, as if lazulite Were cut to filmy blue and gold; and one, Black with gold bosses; and a purple one, Wings broad as is my palm with silvery moons And script of what the Gods meant when they made This delicate work, flitting across the shade, This breath a burning jewel, at the next With closed vans seeming like the faded twig It perched on, or the dry brown mossy bark. âSee!â Nesta cried, âhe hath a side for love, And life, and joy; for foes another side, Lest they who hate him slay him: Master dear! It is the law; life is a brittle loan, Who makes good usance of it doeth well, But without craft and wit this cometh not.â Round the great trunks, with deadly strict embrace, Caressing them to death like strumpets fair Who kiss to kill, the long llianas climbedâ The giant creepersâsnakes among the plants, Winding and winding till they come to crown, Then spread their lightsome leaves and poisonous fruit Bold in the sunshine. There four-handed folk, Monkey, and ape, and marmoset, long-tailed, Fur-bonneted, black-maned, with mocking eyes And old men's faces, chatter, scream, and crack The painted bush-rat's nuts, or filch from bees Their hoarded honey. Here some serpent-vine Hath choked its tree; the strangled trunk is down Mouldering to dust, and the wise elephant, Pacing the wood as though a black mount moved, With ponderous tread, breaks the proud ruin up And is not 'ware. There from some lower limb, In the green twilight, hangs the giant worm, Monstrous and mottled, with a bloomy sheen On chilly gold and purples gleaming, tail Knotted upon the branch, the lithe, small head, With devilish eyes, and black, forked, slimy tongue Swings like an innocent spray till there shall pass With dainty hoof the unwitting antelopeâ And thenâhell gapes!âthe swift coils cling and crush: 'Tis forest murder, as the Gods ordained. âSee!â murmured Nesta, âhere was one whose foot So swiftly sped that ere the dust of it Had time to settle she was out of sight: And here is one, the python, huge and still, Drags sleepy coils on the slow-measured earth; And yet the swift is slain, the sluggard feeds, Because 'twas so decreed, and the law stands, That lives, by lives, pass unto other lives.â After the forest came an upland. Here The trees thinned out, the river spread its bed, By waving reeds and watergrass in flower On each bank margined. Yet another day Through thorny bush, high grass and aloe-spears Our march led, till a path turning to hills Bent southward. Then we quit our caravan, And come, by climbing, to a table-land Spreads wide and wide, with thorn trees scattered thick Far as the eye could see. All silently We thread a thicket; at its verge, our guide Bids gaze; and lo! Great King! such sight to view As did amaze my Tyrians and me. Gracious the scene was: Syrian hills are fair With golden crocus and the rose-laurel And scarlet lilies every silver stream Enamelling; and goodly Egypt shews With palms, and temples, and its waving grain. But here a great park spread so bounteous For grass and grove, for rock and rippled stream, For shade and sunshine, for its swards and sands And far off bordering of dim blue hills, It seemed to be a garden of the Gods, Where we had pushed unwelcome. For that plain Was peopled, Pharaoh! not like SaÃ¯s here Nor thy royal townsâwith thronging citizens Nor built upon with walls nor set with streets; Rather a populous city of the wild; A sylvan capital inhabited By creatures of the fur and hoof. In troops, In herds, in hosts, they pastured on the green, Scoured o'er the flying sand, ran merry rings For sport, or joy of life, or amorous play: A thousand myriad beasts! beasts of all breeds That mead and forest rear. Some may men see Even by Nile, and some were never seen Till so we broke into their pleasaunces. Only the Lady Nesta knew their names: Antelopes, pied and spotted; antelopes Like great white bulls and cows; black antelopes Horned as with spears; and one, purple with cream, Having striped shanks, dropped flanks, and ass's tail And four soft horns; The okapi of Sir H. H. Johnston. striped horses, beasts which bore Bull-necks and limbs of deer; great armoured pigs With horny snouts; and long-necked estridges Flapping black wings. But most of all, I marked That mighty wondrous brute, theretofore seen Only in hieroglyphs at Ombos, tall As thrice my stature, dappled like a pard, Yellow on white, with long, wide, shambling legs Hoof, tufted tail, sloped withers, stretching neck Four cubits long, having flesh-horns on head, And limpid eyes. The gentle monster grazed In tree tops, with a dainty lip and tongue Culling gold balls from the mimosa bough. I would have spared, but those with Hamilcar Slew it, and stripped the hide, and lay it here To be thy carpet. Other beasts roamed there Countless and curious; shaggy lions, lords Of field and forest, held, in solitude, Their savage court apart. Grave elephants Swung past in stately files; grey river-hogs Grunted for roots: the painted leopard laid The roses of his golden coat at rest On the forked branch. 'Twas like another world Whereto men come not and the beasts are kings. Yet we lacked meat, and soon with spear and bow From those fleet foresters our hunters drew Tax for the ships. But that same day thy slave Had perished, ere his purpose could be won, Save for my lady and the guardian Gods. While we did follow on the trail of game, At entry of a thicket, Nesta cried: â'Ware, O my Life! I see a sign of fear: A spotted wolf has crossed us to the left, And twice the eagle-owl doth warn me back. This path is dangerousâah! have a care.â But I, hot with the chase, went heedless on Sighting my quarry and, with shaft on string, Was striding fast when, following faithfullyâ Her light foot never weary, knowing well All woodland marksâNesta did seize my gown, And whispered, âMaster, look! notest thou not Yon grass across our path hath not its hue Of native green? Why grows it sere and bent? Why lies it shaped and smooth? I pray thee fling This great stone at the place.â Why I obeyed Hardly I know, but hurled the fragment there, And where it struck the false earth opened wide, The lying swards sank down; gaped a big pit, Black, deep, and steep, dug in the hunting path, Set thick with sharpened stakesâthe wood-folks' way To snare their food;âso did thy servant 'scape. Next pushing from the shore with favouring wind We sail across a bay to âSerpent's Head,â First of three cliffs, planted like towers in the sea, Sundered some half a league. Then,âfor the moon Lighted our way, and the night airs blew kind,â Down a long desolate land our galleys steered, Where nothing showed, no clustered huts, no glow Of hunters' fires, or village torch, or gleam Of shallop's sail, or paddle of canoe. Only wild rocks, by scorching suns burned bare, Under the moonbeams grey and black; thick bush Edging the tawny sands, wherefrom we heard, Commingling with the moaning of the surf, The roar of prowling lions. 'Tis a tract They call âthe low shoreâ; by thy life! a place Hard and unlovely as Amenti's gates. Nathless when fell the night-wind all three ships Manned oars and rowed with will; for we were fresh, Rested, well fed. So all day long those blades Tripped to the music of the flute and drum Over the ocean floor; and jocundly Rower from rower took the sweat-stained oar. On evening of third day when we were spent And evil weather lowered southwardly, I seek a cape, juts friendly to the sea, By two small islands shielded, where we find Fair shelter, and make commerce with a tribe Of peaceful fishers. Then, by hanging crags And rock-strewn beaches, with a range to north Of towering mountains, we do skirt a coast They name the Uplands. Outside on the main The waves roll high, but under reef and shoal Quiet paths help us till the great sea sleeps And once again by moonlight, wafted on, Without an oar we passed SharÃ´ti's huts; Sail down beyond a black hill hung with woods; Till moored at Attelet, where long reefs lend Good shelter-spot, we wait the northern winds, Which, gently breathing, bring us plain in view Under a hill, a rock, shaped like a sail Seeming to round a castle-fashioned crag Washed by the surf. Still speeding on, we come Beyond ShangÃ¢ni and a shallow bight To Merka, on a sandy mount. And here A pilot from the savage people told The coast-names and the course to steer. At eve By Brawa he would have me take the Dove Outside the reef which gave to Ram and Whale Good refuge, saying that my ship ârode deep.â But at the southern end a current brake Against the wind. The channel we would seek Boiled with a sea-race. If right on we hold The rocks must take us; if we try the gap, Short wavelets, breaking angry, drown my ship. Already hardly can the rowers keep Their benches, and the curling brine bursts in. I was at loss: I cried, âThe oar-ports plug! Make fast the hatches! Come, for your lives, to deck!â When Nesta, at my side, fearless and calm, Whispered me, âMaster! no sea-lore have I, But on our great sweet waters twice and thrice I have beheld a strange thing done at this Which ended well. Suffer thy servant here A little of her will.â At that she turned Where, at her cabin entry, swung a lamp Lighting the image of her country's God Done grim in gold and ivory: for whom By night and day she fed that flame. The lamp Held of the sunflower oil two measures full; This did she seize, and with her lithe strong wrist Flung it to windward. By thy life, O King! Soon as that oil did fall upon the sea It mingled, spread and widened in a film Of diverse colours which enchained the waves Breaking their crests down, flatting what was worst And hardest of their rush; so that no more, Tho' 'twas at roughest in the middle race, The green hills leapt on board: scarcely one crest Wetted our deck; my galley safely steered Into the channel: Nesta with her slavesâ The two Egyptian handmaids kneeling hereâ Laughingly tying up her sea-drenched locks. So came we, nothing harmed, down all that shore, Ever inside the reefs, skirting a land Was all red stone and bush, and hanging shelves Of sand and rock which took the ceaseless rage Of tumbling billows, in a noise and spume Terrible, deadly. Yet the Silver Dove Flew straight and sure, till at a river's mouth We entered glad. The black folk name the stream Juba. The place was good: we rested there. END OF THE THIRD DAY THE FOURTH DAY Ithobal sails the Unknown Sea Where divers gestes and merveilles be; He hath a dream on Afric's strand The meaning strange to understand. May the King live in greatness, peace and strength! May he have favour of the Awful Gods! Thus far, O Pharaoh! were thy vessels come By sailing of six moons; in sooth so far There was another land and sea and sky. Think not thy servant's tongue a lying tongue If he shall tell thee that while we put south, Day after day, and night succeeding night, Close-clinging to the shore, or, with fair winds, Scudding from point to point, the stars ye know In Egypt's dark and in the murk of Tyre, Which go around the North Star and around, And have their seasons fixed to rise and set: All these sank low and lower in the sea Astern of me. And Ishtar's Star sank down Deeper and deeper towards the leaping waves Till, where we camped at Juba, look! it sate No higher from the margin of the main Than shines thy pharos at the mouth of Nile. Moreover, as we measured league by league Of multitudinous billows and long coasts Forever leading South as if this Earth Stretched edge to Sunânay! and beyond the Sunâ For, mighty Pharaoh! where our camp was pitched Yon orb which rolls in gold through Egypt's sky And at his highestâeven in the Crabâ Here southwardly doth setâthat self-same Sun Blazed northwardly and went to setting north, And rose in the northern east;âI say new stars Week after week sparkled into our sight; New skies; new constellations: Oh! a world, A heaven, unviewed by any Mage or Seer, Unnamed by Soothsayers, Astrologersâ Our eyes the first to watch its gleaming swarms. Brightest of all there grew up from the wavesâ One moon before the Star of Ishtar sankâ A wondrous light, Southern Cross. four splendent orbs so ranged As are those four great jewels on thy breast O Mighty Pharaoh! with one smaller star Like to thine emerald button, holds them back: A breastplate, target, or a cross, might be, Its shape nigh to four-square: we steered by it When the North Star went down and helped no more. The river runneth seaward 'twixt low banks Of tufted sand; men may not find its mouth Passing aloof, unless one guide the eye Like our black pilot knowing well all signs; And, at dry time crafts cannot enter there By reason of a bar where great waves burst, Would wreck tall ships. But when the river brims, And sea swells full, galleys may make their way In quiet weather to the peaceful stream Flowing a bowshot broad 'mid sandy flats. Here huge scaled crocodiles drowse in the sun; And mangroves, glossy-leaved, whose arching roots Are populous with creeping things and fish, Breathe forth at sunset poison. Yet, inside Strong mind I had to stay and fill my ships With meat and meal, and learn where we had come And what the peoples were, and if, beyond, Lay secrets hidden for my lord the king. Long parle, and perilous we held; their chiefsâ Bedecked for battle, clad with lion skins Or monkey-fur or spotted leopard's peltâ Sat fierce along the beach, their warriors With spears, and shields of hide, and bows, and clubs, Waiting for word of peace or war. I bade My trusty Tyrians gird their swords; we stood Ten-score stout men who knew not fearâwith those Aboard, sufficient guards. I would not brook From the wild men ill-dealing; but my guide, My star of womenâNestaâmurmured me:â âSuffer their ways a little, 'twill be well; They do consult their Gods.â Thereat she used Strange words seemed sweet to them; but these beat heads, In sudden reverence on the sand, and clasped Hands across breasts as though a Goddess spake: Then brought their sorcererâa painted priest, Hung with men's bones, and teeth of snake, and beads,â Who, with dark arts, and magic mumbled spells, Plucked, from a basket near, a cob of corn; Laid it on earth, then grovelled, moaned, and writhed: And where the corn was, look! a little snake! Whereat the savage people yelled for war. But Nesta spake again; then took a shaft From Gondah's quiver; laid it on the earth, Drew from her breasts the little amulet Which helped her at her prayers; and, clasping this, Bowed down over the arrow. When she raised That fearless visage, lo! no arrow there! But a long, glittering, green, lithe serpent hissed, Which seized the sorcerer's worm and swallowed it. Then the wild people shouted loud, âPeace! peace! Peace with the strangers!â And they bring much gifts And kiss the fringe of Lady Nesta's gown, And lay their foreheads on her feet; whilst I Made question of my mistress whence her craft: But she, her lips set firm, softly replied:â âMy silence steads thee better than to tell; Things seen are not so true as things unseen; The Gods are with us! be content, sweet Sir!â Thereat we took the ships in. From the hills, Thirty days' journey off, the river came Broad, lined by canes, with deep pools interspaced Where the great river-horses rolled and washed And strange things stole to drink,âthe water-buck, The long-faced hartebeest, quilled porcupines, Crooked-tusked wart-hogs, sable antelopes, The grey sagacious elephants, and he, Who roams tyrannous lord of all the woods, The tawny lion. And there flocked strange birds, Bustards, and many-coloured doves, and kites, Waders, and fishing-fowl, and birds with ears, Which slay the lizards; and another, calls The hunter to the tree where honey hides. Here a whole moon we moored, and beached our keels, And freed them of sea-grass, and hacked away Sea-shells, and brine-rust from the bilge. We made The leaks all good, with juice which flows like milk From wounded trees, but dries to pitch, and binds. Also we mended well what was amiss In hull and gear, and roped our sails anew; Re-stowed the holds, and laid for ballast there Millet, and sesamum, and shark-flesh dried. Alack! I lose upon the channel here Five of my faithful ones; a river-horse Seized in his massive jaws a shallop's side; Crushed the frail boat, and of the six within Only did SothÃ«s 'scape. And twice in sleep The crocodiles dragged down a Tyrian. Then fever took my crews; some score had died Till Lady Nesta taught us where to find A herb was bitter, with a lance-head leaf And purple blossom; and the broth of this Did surely cure. Whilst the ships lay at rest We rode the river upward until rocks And headlong rapids stayed us. Was a town Of peaceful naked folk, set in a grove Of nut trees:â'tis a stately, gallant growth, Will yield you twenty-score for food, or give The sweet tree milk in its own ivory cup. The town was walled with thorn lest lions snatch Sleepers by night, or enemies assail; Or those four-handed tribes, the long-tailed apes, Steal the ripe nuts. There came a caravan Of traders from the hinder-land; we spake With their chief peoples. Wonderful to hear Their stories of the secret world beyond. Fifty days' march inlandâa mount they said Lifts its long ridge a league-high to the air, And hath forever in the burning blue A crown of snow. And yet beyond, vast seas Victoria Nyanza. Shut in the hills, where one might row and row Eight nights and days and not reach nether shore. Moreover, from this mighty hollow flows A broad strong river, leaps in thunderous fall Down a vast steep: then runs northânorthâaye! northâ Whither none wotteth. O my lord the King! Maybe this is the fountain of thy Nile! Not Lady Nesta knew; her country lay Far offâfar offâshe said; yet she had viewed Wide inland waters; had heard speech of men With tails, of pigmy men dwelling in woods; Naked, dust-coloured, using poisoned shafts; Of men that lived around a towering mount, With changeless cap of snow, who ate their kind, And made dark sorceries. We put to sea Scantier in company, but well refreshed, Refitted, good for toil, glad to steer on Whither the Gods might lead and thy great will. Yet of the coast-folk none would sail with us Save one grey ancient knowing of the bays And lacking for his withered belly meat. âYe go,â they said, âto death! there is a way; We wot the road; but not how to return. Best die in daylight: not in night and hell.â Still we stood forth; fair ran the rippled sea; New-painted on its wavelets shone the ships; Under our stems, like birds before a plough, Over the silver furrows flying fish Darted in flocks; white sea-birds, wide of wing, Soared round our masts, and screamed for orts; before, Behind us, gambolled dolphins, glossy-black, Pearl-bellied, mocking with their speed our oars. Full fed, by friendly winds favoured and moon, Down a long coast we scudded, rimmed with sand And then red hills; and, by the daytime, isles Crowding along the sea: in shore of these The rolling waves ran low. We passed flat reefs Where sea-fowls nest, and sleek seals drowse i' the sun, And then a rock, washed all around by waves, Built like a citadel; one would believe This spot a fortalice, planned for some war. Afterwards the clouds lower, storm portends, Shelter were well. My dark-skinned pilot points Where two white patches on a sandy hill Mark refuge; 'tis an island, thick with huts, Fringed with the mangrove-tree, who loves to dip Her feet in the salt. An inlet opens fair; Our oarsmen strain to reach it; while the sky Begins to blaze with lightning, and the sea Blackens beneath the thunder-clouds. My Dove Guides Ram and Whale into a still lagoon Where we ship oars and praise the Gods anew. 'Tis seen that mercy breedeth love, O King! My lady had for maidens, damsels twain, Bond girls of Egypt, Asenath and Seet,â Who tended her and tired her hair. Goodwill Had grown between the mistress and the maids; For Nesta was born gentle; and no soul Near her, but joyed in sunshine of her smile. The maids to bathe betook them in the creek, Swimmers of Nile, glad of their water-play; Laughing they clove the milk-warm evening wave In strife who should be first to bring to deck Blue lotus-buds; and Nesta from the ship Beat her soft palms to cheer them. Presently A glitter of grey light beneath the green! A black fin cuts the water! Nesta cries:â âA shark! the shark!â and then her countenance I first saw fall; for, 'twixt the maids and ship Steered the fierce murderer of the deep, aware Of his sure prey; and they, aware of him, Bent anguished eyes on their pale mistress there. Death if none helped, death unto him who helped! Then with set lips my mistress uttered word, Half prayer, half mandate, and those Africans WhÃ³se necks she saved from knife of Tyrian priestâ Sawâunderstood,âand for sweet duty's sake And love of her kind eyes, did this, O King! A lance-head lay on deck, barbed at the point, The shaft new sharpened for its ashen pole A cubit long. Gondah strips off his gown, Grips the sharp steel, and rolls the cloth around, Leaping into the sea; so Handah too Holding his fighting-knife. With this the boy Strikes at th' attacking fish, who hath in front Young Gondah swimming. Savaged with the stroke, The monster turns to seize; opes his fell jaws, Toothed terrible, forgetting what he sought,â Those naked maidens. Look! the fearless boy 'Tween jaw and palate of that dreadful beast Thrusts the wrapped spike. The murderer closes down The cruel mouth, but hath a bridle fixed Will ride him to his death. Mad wallows he While Handah stabs and stabs. All impotent Rolls the baulked fish into the crimsoned depths: The maids come trembling home. But Gondah's arm Was gashed from wrist to shoulder by those fangs: Mortal I deemed till Lady Nesta dressed The deep-cut wounds and laid some simples in, And bound all with fine linen, fair and spiced; While at her feet the crouching African Gave his life, ten times over, with his gaze. Asquat upon the deck, munching his grain, Mine ancient conned the galleys southwardly; A low coast on the left, then close to shore A yellow island, Manda; this we skirt Since the black pilot saith, âLamu lies nigh, Where water is, and goodly markets meet.â At Lamu presently we moor; a town Set on a long, low isle of silver sand, Fronting a river's mouthââOziâ 'twas namedâ The people friendly, liking well to trade. We buy of sim-sim, in their bags of mat, Plantains and nuts, for linen cloth and beads. âWhither go ye?â they ask. âWe go,â I say, âAs far as yonder coast goes stretching South; As far as yonder ocean thither rolls.â âKnow ye the road?â âThe end of it we know,â They answered; âit is darknessâit is death; It is where lives that God who suffers not That others live; whose name, to utter it, Would make the thunder speak and the rains fall. Yet hence a little space the road is good, Ye shall come soon to islands of the sea: M'vita that hath fair harbours, Leopard's Cape, Malindi; then Oyambu's creek and huts; And after M'vita, looms the Isle of Spiceâ Pemba; and then the great rich Monkey-Isleâ Zangue, where ye may find men to show course Nearer and nearer to what goal ye seek Outside the lawful waters. As for us, We will die where our fathers lived and died.â We beached at white Malindi; coral reefs Break the grey billows ere they reach the sand. Northward, a sandy bluff; behind the beach Fan-palms, with flat crowned thorn-trees, and a plain Of goat-grass and ilook; innermore stands A range of hills. There was a cavern here Carved in the soft stone by a stream that broke Out of the woods; and bowered fair and green With climbing flowers and plants that love the moist; And hanging canes, where golden lizards glanced And bright sun-birds, like living jewels, sucked The honey blooms. Outside, the blazing day; Within, cool gloom, and soft, clean cushions spread Of silvery sand. Its peace invited usâ My lady and thy slave: for noon was red, And we had wandered far, glad of firm Earth, New from unsteady footings of the decks. At entrance I did lay my shoes aside, And hung my cloth on spear; who enters then Unasked, must die: it is the Libyan law. I fell to slumber in that cavern, King! And had strange visions. In my sleep I saw A Queen of stately stature, dark of hue: Dark, but most comely: oh! a form and face Exceeding beautiful; the black, curled hair, Clustered on shining brow and velvet nape In such wise that no diadem was lacked To grace its jetty glory. Yet the head,â The Sovereign head in majesty supremeâ Albeit touched with sorrow, touched with shameâ Wore a great crown was beat of burning gold, Bordered and bossed with jewels such as Thou, Lord Pharaoh! keepest not in Treasure-House. For round its rim and on its circling bands Mingling with moony pearls had robbed the sea Of all its choicest wealthâglittered great stones Of sard and amethyst and lazulite, Turkis and sapphire, beryl, jasper, jade, With rubies red as doves' blood, chrysoprase, Lucent as light of Spring, and adamants Which shut the dayshine in, and flashed it forth Like little Suns. And on her shapely arms, Dark as the date's stone, softer than its bloom, Great armlets hung of hammered gold, set close With emeralds and coral. Round the neck, Carved like thy porphyry columns, black and smooth, A gorget, all of hammered gold, was clasped; In shape a slave ring; and the sweet strong breasts, Two hills of ebony entopped with rose, Were crossed and braced with the slave's shoulder-straps Done all in burnished gold. The Queenly One Lay, in a leopard's skin enwrapped, whose sheen, Dappled with night-black rayings and rosettes, Clung supple to the lovely waist, and took The bendings of her beauteous limbs. Her hands, Moulded for force and tenderness, to grasp Shaft of swift spear, or coy a lover's cheek, Were manacled together with rude grip Of golden chains. And the fine feet of her, Carved of black alabaster,ânobler made Than ever Goddess yet in shrine or fane Had worshippers to kiss,âshook when they moved Links of a tinkling slave-chain wrought in gold. Thus bound she lay, this goodly youthful Queen: And only by her eyesâwonderful eyes, Full of disdain, half conquering her despair; Full of despair, half banishing disdain; Lighted with pride and pity, sufferance, rageâ Knew I she lived. Her prison seemed a land Vast, various, gilded from the North to South By always shining summers; rich with plains Of arable and tilth: with orchards grown Where birds and deer were gardeners; with woods Where giant trees made mansions of green light, Peopled by unknown tribes; with rivers born From horns of flower-clad mountains, lifting high Shoulders of snow into the burning blue, Taking their fruitful way through valleys, fair With blossoming reeds and floating lotus-buds And feathered waving canes, and then made pools In bosom of their hills, which were like seas So wide from coast to coast. Deserts were there, Dry barren deserts where the spotted wolf Findeth no drink but blood; and antres deep By ill-folk habited; and poisonous swamps Where none might pass and live. The wilderness, The waste, the marsh, the barren upland scrub Where wild beasts rage; these things did lie around That prisoned Lady's bed, shutting her offâ Or so I deemedâfrom help and humankind. Yet there was help, for at her girdle swung, Thonged to its perfect work of beaded seeds, Two keys of gold. As if by some two locks Which these might openâwere there friendly aidâ Way would be found to set that bound Queen free; To give her lovely life and mistresshood, And all for which the Gods had fashioned her: So rich, so beautiful, so noble! Nay! One bar did let and hinder! Round this land Ran two wide borders, blue, immense, profound; Beset with dreadful perils, hard to cross, Long to unfold, which must be nathless crossed, Must be unfolded,âthis way first, then that,â Ere the sweet Queen could rise. And then, dread Lord! I saw the silver dove of Ishtar light At those sad, captive feet, as when it drew Mine own steps to the slave-bazaars in Tyre; And in its beak a sunflower seed, which means âI follow, follow alwaysâ; and I heard Murmured from that most sovereign mouth the words, âIthobal, son of Magon! succour me!â And I,ââBut how, Most Noble?â And she sighed, âWith ships, thou Tyrian! And with these gold keys.â Then seemed I once again aboard; yet ah! What waste of waters! what mad whirl of waves! What dreadful rocks! What shores that slide and slide Out of the blue of sky into sea's green And back into the blue; and never cease And never turn, or turn only to show New coasts that trend north, north and always north; Till the strayed sun, that set upon our right, Dips on our left again; if we come live To the ocean-gates I know and come with ships. Yet in my vision, King! I had but two. Moreover, Lord! I dreamed strange sequent dreams. Years rolled, and reigns and generations. Nay! Thy realm had passed: thy piercing Pyramids Had melted into bluntness with the suns Of sweeping centuries. Yet, while those sped Folks found, it seemed, the imprisoned Queen and brought Some help and homage. In my vision shewed Men in white garments, Arab men who bore Money and gifts, taking away for these Ivory, and gold, and slaves, and spiceries. And there rose kings, black lords of flattened face And iron breasts, who ruled the tribes by blood And kept what peace they knew. Then at the last Strange mariners I saw sail from the West; Their chief of noble bearing, bearded, fierce, With galleys four came downward on my track, And round the dreadful Cape and put to north, Where I had southward rowed and southward sailed; Until in this same cavern where we lay I saw him stand and gaze towards the port Where his bruised fleet did anchor. Then I heard The imprisoned Queen sigh,ââIthobal of Tyre, The blue wide barrier hath been rended twice! The sea's stern girdle falls away from me!â Yet did my vision hold. White faces came More and more frequent through the perilous belts, The thirsty desert, the enfolding hills, The murderous tribes, the lion-haunted wilds, The slave-paths, and the burning villages, To where the Lady dwelled. But prone no more! No more in chains! She sate upon a throne Carved out of tusks and gold, with jewels decked, Draped with her own royal robes: the sweet proud eyes Gleaming with joy and grace of fresh life found; While Ishtar's dove cooed, and my dream was done. But Nesta laid her face between her palms, And bowed her head, and kept long silence. Then She lifted on me look of tenderness, And spake these words: âMaster! be comforted! Thy dream is good and true, and giveth theeâ What the Gods mayâto see drawn back the veil Hiding the things that will be. These will be! Long, very long hereafter they will be. She whom thou didst behold chained and alone, Sore-suffering, shut away from love and hope; She was my AFRICA, my darkened Land, My hid, forgotten Land; whose child I am, Whose lover; and for whose sake I have lived To be thy mate and guide. Her days begin! Ithobal's ships, much-daring, shall break through The sea-barsâblue, immense,âthat hemmed her in; And there shall come to her adventurers Seeking her goldâfor that is how the keys, Fashioned of gold, feign way t' unlock the gates. And with gold-seekers shall go merchantmen, And tramp of many caravans; and trade Which, pushed with blood, shall end in peace and wealth. Nay! Stay!â she said; âalso I see that one Who doubleth back on this sea-track of thine, And cometh hither to our very cave Twenty-one centuries hence: a western chief, Iberian, swart and brave: the voices say His name to me in Greek: I wist not what; I wot not why: but they bid write it so.â Thereat, Nesta foresees Vasco di Gama, who did visit Malindi. on the white sand, with lids shut close And slow-moved finger, this mark she did trace ? A large capital digamma appears as a figure. I know not and she knew not wherefore thus! But 'tis a letter of Ãolians. A little while she paused; then from her breast Drew forth the precious amulet of gold That helped her at her prayers, and clasping this Dropped o'er her face her headcloth; lay awhile Cowering and crouched: then she spake once again: âThis is a high deed which Thou doest, Lord! Mother of many deeds! Past thee and him And those who follow, and the acts to be, And the long patience of the waiting Gods, I see my Land with Sister Continents Sisterly seated: her dark sons I see From wars and slave-yokes freed. These sunlit shores Happy with traffic, while a thousand ships Sail on the waves first clove by Ithobal.â This was my vision, Pharaoh! in the cave. South from Malindi ran we with soft airs Breathing off shore; so did I let all drive Over warm waters, under scorching skies To the green island Pemba, where we lay Safe anchored in a shallow gulf, was lined With spice-brush and the pale green aloe-spears And the wild tree-wool; for a hard wind came Hot from the south, and far away at sea Pillars of cloud and water passed; storm-whirls, Which with fierce rage and furious roar uptore The heavy, rolling billows, flinging them In scud and spume into the tortured air, Which howled and twisted till the heavens seemed brine, Hiding the sun. In such a water-spout My galleys had been as the gnats that drown Where Nile leaps wildest. But our sailors burned Sweet incense to the Sea Gods; and next morn The tempest spent its wrath, the loud winds lulled; Lightly we set from ShÃ¢ki, steering straight For Zangweâ'tis an island, great and fair, Sitting along the coast; with downs and woods And harbour looking to the sinking sun Where we made port, seven moons of voyage done END OF THE FOURTH DAY. THE FIFTH DAY Ithobal, ever sailing South, Enters at many a river's mouth; Through fair and foul; 'mid joys and woes Unto the land of gold he goes. Health and longevity to Egypt's King! The Mighty Pharaoh! May the all-seeing Gods Grant thee good peace! We lay at the great Isle Till the moon filled her sickle to a shield; Then, heartened, sailed again into the South. How oft we beached, how oft we crept for fear Behind reef-wall; how oftâsave for Kneph's help And Ishtar's mercyâwe had seen our ships Splintered on savage cliff or lurking rock, Or by huge hissing billows overwhelmed 'Twere long to tell, nor good, O Lord of Lords! For patience of thine ear. Still southward rolled The unbroken coast, white, yellow, red, or brown, Rugged with headlands, rounded with low dunes, Beached with black stones, or silvery sands, or belts Of the mud-loving mangrove. So we passed Upanga's bluff, and where the low shore holds âThe House of Peaceâ: Sinda, Koronjo's reef, KutÃ¢ni's ruddy wall, Mafia's Isle With angry breakers fenced; Rufiji's mouths Where Sea-cows live, Manateewhich have a tail and fin And fishy forms: yetâI lie not, O King! Breasts of a woman and give suck. We spy Mirambe's brow and, o'er Kirinje's huts, Long flat-topped hills. Then the tall nut-trees wave On Songa. Thence athwart two shallow gulfs, Nondo and Kuvu, unto Lindi's streamâ Good watering;âand hard by, the Mushroom Rock, Madjovi. So through Mnazi's sheltered smooths To where Rov'uma pours into the green Her turbid flood, with blood of many a slave Foul mingled. Then the Kongo Cape we round, Which seems an island as one sails from north; And slip, well-pleased, from storm and savage seas To timely shelter of the foam-washed reef Fronting its shore. These were the names we heard Of pilots, fisher-folk, and merchant-men Trading the marge with shallow feeble craft, Ill-rigged for evil weather; yet their seas Well known to them, and here they bid us mark The giant current Great Equatorial Current. of of mid-ocean, Part itself like a branching stream of earth, To flow this side and that. Next UlÃ»'s Isles, Majumbi's coral crags; and then, in swarm, Islets,âKerimba's archipelago;â Imo and Fumo, and their sister rocks Perilous of approach; next, seven sharp hills Over Arimba; Pomba Bay behind Lent friendly haven. Skirting Pardo's point Dark hillocks show in the bush; follow steep slopes Rich-wooded; then a hill, lofty and white, So shaped that one might deem, coming from north 'Twas a great galley of thy Nile at sail. Afterwards, under lee of Mozambik, we rest, Well-covered. For a fierce wind drew Betwixt the main and certain sea-girt land Whereof they spake, towards the rising Sun, A mighty Island. Madagascar. Being calmed, we rowed Across Mokambo Bay, and lay awhile In Mluli River where within the mouth A green isle towered, Monkey Island. inhabited by Apes. By thy Soul! Pharaoh! even thou hadst smiled To watch the grave-tailed elders of the troop And monkey-mothers with their furry babes Viewing thy ships approach; hardly less men Than those who pushed from shore with food to sell On log or light canoe. 'Twas at the close Of the eighth moon we oared from KilimÃ n And came by rosy bluffs and running hills To where the deep sea darkened to the flood Flung by a lord of rivers, broad and deep, Far draining from the inland. 'Twas a stream The Zambesi. Vast as thy Nile, dread King!âLuÃ¢bo namedâ Coming adown from distant hills and lakes Through full five hundred leagues of wild and wood, And falling to the salt by many mouths With black groves fringed, and barred by shifting sands. Yet, with full sea, and patient watch, a ship May happy entrance find. We lowered sails, And on the broad green rollers oared our way, By ample channel, to the upper pool Where the great river rested, ere it gave Its tribute to the main. Under a tree Smooth-barked, with slender leaves, whose massive trunk Ten of my Tyrian rowers, clasping hands, Could not encompass, we did set the camp, Thorn-girt, well guarded, for the folk were rude, The country troubled. Yet these eyes have seen No fairer, King! for sylvan majesty And wonder of the works the high Gods mould. 'Twas the beasts' home,âman came a stranger there. If one did wander on the river's marge A world of forest creatures stole to sight. The bush-pig squeaked; the wart-hog, in the reeds, Grunted and wallowed; shaggy buffaloes Cropped the young grass between the ant-hills; deer Mottled and dappled, darted through the brake; Bush-buck, and water-buck, roan antelopes, And sable antelopes; and o'er the open waste The stately elands roamed, with bearded gnus. The kudu snorted from the thorny flat, From waving marishes where bitterns fished; And river-horses bathed and crocodiles Dried their grey bulk i' the sun, and with cold eyes Blinked for their prey. Yet was it wondrous, King! These would not slay their friends! A spur-winged bird Ran frolic o'er the monster's scaly spine, And from his frightful jaws picked water-lice, While round his couch of slime the painted duck Sported; flamingoes preened their rose-red wings; The great grey herons slept upon one leg; And all those river things had peace of him. Such is the jungle law; yet, if a doe Timidly tripped to drink, if careless slave Drew nigh to fetch of water; look! a rush Of that live log! a snap of rending teeth! And peace was broke, and the stream bloodied. Turn Into the grove of green mimosa trees Gilt by ball-blossoms, and we heard the dovesâ Bright plumaged, with the jewelled necks, and feet Sandalled in redâcoo love from branch to branch Forgetful of the falcon on the crag, And fierce king eagle circling in the blue. The crowned cranes stalked about the silent pool; The snowy egrets fed; the sacred birds Of this thine Egyptâthe staid Ibisâpaced; From hollows of the towering trunks by pairs The horn-bills brayed; from purple bunch to bunch Of the wild vines starlingsâgold, ruby, blue,â Sparkled; and coloured finches piped and pecked; Small busy weavers built their hanging nests To spite the robber snake, whose stealthy coils I' the dead leaves glistered. With a chosen band Of fearless ones, and followers from the tribes We mountedâthree canoesâthe splendid stream Many days rowing. For the people said High up was sight of marvelâspot they named The âSmoke that Speaks.â Falls of the Zambesi. Sometimes with paddles plied, Sometimes with cords, we made a perilous way By gorge and rapid where the strong flood raced Through rocks all foam, and hanging boughs; sometimes The channel sobered, and then came to ear From far aloof a murmur, night and day, Like whispering thunder. Now we quit the boats; Strike through the forest; march three daysâthe noise More and more filling all the air with roar Unspeakable,âand, where the forest clears, Away over the tree-tops hang great clouds Lighted to golden white under the sun, Thick black against the moon-beam. At the end My band steps forth upon a level place Fronting the dreadful glory. King of Kings! Ithobal knoweth not to tell this sight! The riverâbroad as is thy Nile in floodâ Comes from the nameless lands, green out of blue, Comes from its purple hills, majestic, brimmed, Its tide of silver quickening as it feels The awful abyss draw. A long, low isle, Whereon the moist airs breed a lavish growth, Cleaves it in twain; then, as if loath to part And mad to join again, the sundered halves Plunge o'er the edge. Seemeth as if they hung Fixed in their very leap; a curl of greenâ Green as the light that strains through fan of palmâ Sits constant on the dizzy precipice Down which the splintered river rages. See! Just here the earth hath opened; the torn rock Gapes to a night-black chasm, lit above, Deep-black, death-black below. From this boils up A steamy smoke as if Amenti there Bubbled and raved; and with the smoke the sound Of a whole sky throbbing with thunder-blasts. Sheer over rim of cliff, half a league long, Into this hold of ravage and of wrath, And flying spume, and murk impenetrable, Dives desperate the river, dives adown Three hundred cubits, if I judge aright, And wildly mingled in its cauldron there, The broken monstrous masses lace and lock And ramp and rear; then bursting forth to light, Go tossing under rainbows and wet rocks And shuddering leaves, into a narrow gorge Crosses athwart their course, scourging their rage Into fresh-leaping furies; till this bulkâ Come from the fountains of a continentâ Gains room to calm; and in wide reach below Slackens its sparkling angers, stays its speed, Clears from its waves the bubbles and the spray And, placid once again, lord of itself, Goes bright and gentle to the awaiting vale. 'Twas tenth moon since the starting from thy shores, O King of Kings! the light half of the moon. At ebb we dropped to sea by western mouth Of vast LuÃ¢boâLady Nesta guideâ For on that river there had lodged with us Men of the upper country, merchant-men, Tall and of comely visages, with garb Richer than wont. Whose speech, when Nesta heard, I marked her great eyes brighten, and her lips Half open as to utter some glad word; Yet did she hold her peace, of counsel wise. But afterwards in private, clasping hands, Whispered me thus: âHeart of my heart, dear Lord! I spake thee true, telling of lands I knew Outside all lands and seas beyond all seas; And how, in tender years, they tore me thence A captive girl, the daughter of a King; And how by long, long journeys I was borne Northward and north, entreated tenderly For reason I was meek and fair to see: And how in those ill days, my sad eyes saw The darkness and the anguish of my Land; Till night by night I dreamed of one should come Fearless and masterful, with ships and men, And find us out, and break the bonds of Hell And be beginning of a glorious dawn. Lo! this hath fallen: those within our camp Come from my country. What they speak is speech Of her who suckled me; of him who died Fighting to save his folk. They know me not, But bear good news, unwittingly. The Prince, My brother, ruleth. All his land is still; The pastures full of kine, the markets brisk, The caravans eager to come and go; And that which in thy home men most desire Thy priests, thy Lords, thy Kings, Pharaoh himself, The gold,âthe rich red gold,âis boundless there; Glistens in river-sands; gleams in the rocks; Is as a common dross. The road thereto Wends by a river, running to the sea, Fifty short leagues from this the Sabi named. Thou hadst desire, I know, some port to find Where we could plant our grain; and, while it springs, Careen thy ships, and make an enterprise To win by traffic some commodities Worthy of Pharaoh's feet. This is thine hour. Sail unto Sabi or to PungwÃª's mouthâ For those are neighboursâbeach thine emptied hulls:â Fill them, refitted, with the harvesting Of wheat and barley. For what still remains Of this hard voyage, stretches vaster yet, More difficult, more dreadful than what's done. Yet shall we at the last attain. Dear Lord! Follow my counsel. I will show the way To where a goodly ballast shall be got For Ram and Whale and Silver Dove. With that I launched and set to sea, ten moons being spent. In days twain, and one night,âthe currents fair, But the breeze foul from south,âwe made the stream, PungwÃª. The coast lies low; a sloping beach; Then thickets; and, 'mid these, sandhills which rise Shaped like thy pyramids. The tide, at spring, Lifts my three galleys lightly o'er the bar Into broad placid waters where a point Lends certain shelter. Like a wall of waves The flood comes in, filling the creeks and nooks, And, draining forth again to sea, lays bare Flats sudden and sharp spits, whereon you spy The idle crocodiles drowse in the sun; The river-horses wade forth of the deeps; And turtles crawl to scrape a nesting place. Here it is well to be: we strand the ships; Build the stockades; and open busy marts, Where the shore-people, swart, and clad in skins, Bring of their victuals, taking wares from us. Thereon my Lady hath devices:âshears The wool from Gondah's head; pricks on the scalp The token of her tribe; when hair is grown Sendeth him with a knot of trusty ones And native people, bearing curious gifts, Northward along the river; while we pass By easy march. The boy's one message was, âClip me and judge me by the sign.â Then too I owe again this lifeâmy King's and mineâ To Nesta. On a day we meet in parle Chieftains and warriors of a warlike breed, Questioning passage, asking weighty tolls. We sit in circle on the river's brink: They with their spears, my men with sword on knee, And there pass angry words. But soon one brings Wine of the country, brewed of millet seed, Heady and sharp, served new in woven bowls Of grasses; and the foremost black of them Signs that I drink, with many a peaceful nod. Whereat my watchful Mistress craftily Drops in the drink a leafâI know not what:â Leaf of some flower, which withers, spits and turns Dull black. I marvel, but she murmurs âLord! He hath not drunk; 'tis custom that they drink Before their guests.â Hereon I bid him quaff: This vile one waxeth ashen; yet I bid, Sternly entreating. They put by the bowl, Baffled and anxious. As it standeth there, A village hound, unnoticed, laps the stuff, And, in a little, rolls its eyeballs, gasps, And falls, all foam and spasms, on the sand. The lying friendly draught was venomed! King! My heart grew hot: I clove the traitor's head From crown to chine. Shouting, the tribesmen rose And fled: there would be war. Five days and nights Swarmed they and buzzed like wasps around the camp, Shooting their shafts, firing the grass, intent To slay us if they might, and spoil our stores. On the sixth day,âwe, being sorely pressed, Half a score Tyrians slain, with camp-followers, Water cut off, and valiant Hamilcar Hurt in the thigh,ârings from the hills a blast Of conches, a beat of drums; long fighting lines, With spears and shields, show brave upon the ridge, Who shout their battle-cry and leap adown, In files and painted squadrons, to the plain. Our foemen hear and fly. First of the host A youthful chieftain, clad in pelt of pard, Whose mounture is a striped horse of the wilds Caparisoned in gold, rides nobly forth With guard of well-armed men. Before our camp He doth dismount: a herald, feather-girt, Advanceth, crieth phrase of peace. But, look! My Lady Nesta bids our gateway ope, Paceth serenely forth: only her maids AttendingâSeet and Asenath. She strips The gemmed cloth from her silk smooth shoulder: See! Branded in red and white upon its round A lizard:â'tis the mark Gondah's skull bore Beneath his wool. Which when the comely Prince Views, he cries lustily, like one distraught For utmost joy, and giveth loud command, And claps his palms hard, flinging first his spear After those fliers. Nesta, drawing nigh, What noise! what tumult! what mad ecstasies Of pride and pleasure! 'Twas their Princess come Home out of bonds and darkness. Where she trod Those fierce ones kissed the earth; to touch her gown Was honour: for the Prince and all his tribe Well knew the Makalanga lizard: sign Of âChildren of the Sun.â Their clamorous glee Scared the lean vultures perched upon the slain. We were delivered and the road lay free. Then marked I how my Lady's words came true: Red gold grew here. Was hardly one of all But had it for the apple of his lance, Or pommel of his sword, or wore it bossed On shield or sandal, or in burnished rings On neck and wrist and ankles. At their feast They served us broth and stews in golden pots. Roast game lay on gold dishes. 'Twas as bronze In Egypt, or as brass in Sidon's streets. For where this river issues from its hillsâ Wonderful granite hills, fantastic, weird, Mightily cragged and cleftâthe white rock holds Gold in great veins; sooth! 'tis a land of gold. Ugambeâ'twas the Chief's nameâmade me learn How his gold-workers delved. A deep shaft sunk Some twenty cubits to the mother-bed, And there this cunning hoard of nature hid To tease and draw mankind! I did descend And crept through cavernous ways and gloomy gates Till we were come to a great chamber hewn In the mid hill. There, lo! all round about The soft gold glittered to the torches' flare Out of its milky stone: sometimes in films, As when they press the purple: sometimes flaked Like glass; or spun like threads of silk; or pouched Massive in pockets; or in branching lines Like moss that grows in chinks, if moss were gold. This rock, wealth-bearing, patient hands break out And bring to air. There, slave-gangs set in rows Pound with hard stone on stone the veiny stuff, Crushing it small. This first they wash and sift For the great pieces; afterwards they roast What's left in furnace till the gold runs clear Caked in the ash: so is their way with gold. Wherefore, great Lord! because this thing is much, And maketh wealth of the world and pleaseth kings, And doth befit ev'n Pharaoh, it behoved To guard the prize for thee. King Suleiman Owned ships and men that brought him gold from Punt And peacocks out of Ophir, and fine gems. Thou, too, mayest haveâshalt haveâLord of all Lords! Thine Ophir in this region where we came Empty, and whence we journeyed, turning back After a six moons' sojourn,ârich enow To buy the fleets of Tyre, if 'twere thy will. For here the gold was dross; the friendly folk Laughed at our lust for the pale yellow yield Which will not fashion head of spear, nor blade Of hunting-knife, nor wear a lifetime through As iron armlet doth or ankle ring; And bore no worth they said, save to be soft In working and to take no rust. With that Gladly they bartered it for beads and cloth And whatsoever gear we had to give, Of Syrian, or Egyptian. Nay, for love Of Lady Nesta, and to honour guests, They did bestow with gentle show of pride Platters and bowls cast out of shining gold, Pouches and girdles, fillets, amulets, Neck-rings, and head-rings: so our caravan Marched seaward from the hills with twelve-score slaves Gold-laden, and another followed it Or ever we set sail; thus I did fill The Black Whale's hold with that rich ballasting From keel to floor. I sent thee back thy ship So freighted as was never craft before, Dunnaged and stowed with gold. SothÃ«s had charge. I filled him with our rice and barley, raised In two crops by the river; bade him press Northwards for Suph, making his benches up With slaves of Sabi. âWhen thou seest,â I said, The star of Ishtar lift i' the north anew And reachest where we crossed that ten days' main, Cleave to the coast till thou beest come to Suph; Then enter by the island, and stand north Till Pharaoh learn of thee and thou canst void Thy cargo on the carpet of his throne.â Thou knowest, King of Kings! thy ship came home And SothÃ«s stands beside thee, who did bring The Black Whale back, and from our silence, news. Moreover, that these opulent fields be kept Secure for thee and us, I made a pact, Solemnly sealed with strange and ancient ritesâ Confirmed by drinking blood and slaying goatsâ Whereby the golden hills devolve to thee Around the springs of Sabi. Thirty men Among the Tyrians, skilfullest to build, Stoutest to fight, best helps at every need, Joyous in dangers, eager for high deeds, I chose from out my rowers. These should take Wives of the country, raise their dwellings, till Sufficient earth for foodâslaves serving them,â And of the thirty, under Hamilcar, Each should be captain over maniples Of three-score warriors, drawn from bravest blood Of Makalanga. Then, to make all sure, They must have fortalice to hold the hills And guard and delve the gold. I did ordain There should be rearedâwhere the rocks favoured us And much fair water bubbledâstructures twain Which the wise Hiram did devise and plan. Of these the foremost was a hold of war, Massive, impenetrable, made to bear All shock of battle, as the sea-cliff takes The battering waves and turns their idle dash. I bid them build it, where the broken crags Gave coign and traverse and good vantage ground, On forehead of a granite mountain scarped Three sides. Along the fourth, to rear a wall Shutting out all but birds. Within the wall The stronghold, circular, with rounded ramps Of hewn stone, laid ten cubits thick; the doors Narrow, and giving entry by strait ways Where but one man could pass; and those strait ways So blocked with buttresses and ambuscades, With cunning corners, fighting-holes and pits; So from the walls above commanded, that No foe could win alive from gate to fort, Or shun deaths showered upon him. In the midst The unfailing fount, good storage for the grain, Space for the men-at-arms, fuel for food, All deftly schemed. In time of peace my men, Housed in ZimbabwÃª's groves, the guards at hand, Would dwell serene and win the gold. At war, Safe in their citadel, ten thousand foes Could count as ten. Beneath, on lower slope, Wise Hiram drew for me a House of Godsâ Ishtar's and Bel'sâ; was to be built to lodge The Lords of Heaven most nobly; all of stone Heedfully shaped, like Babylonian bricks, Faultlessly squared; was to be oval-framed, Cubits eight-score and eight the longer way; Walls thick cubits fifteen, high, twenty-one; And, crowning all the walls, should run a row Of Ishtar's birds cut of the soft green rock, With those high sacred pillars interplaced, Which mean the Sun, and Life, and Love, and Death And things men tell not of. Also those walls, Laid to a hair's breadth, fashioned close and fair, Nicely obeying what the Gods enjoin, Should so stand, pierced with window and with door, That at due time the Northern Stars we knew Should through each chink let shine their holy light On altar-slab and graven stele and floor; So that men mark the Seasons, and the days Of fast and feast. And Hiram schemed to build Patterns upon the wall, with chosen stones To such a point and such; a fish-bone course Which meaneth what ye wist; and on south-east The zigzag pattern, sign of Water Stars And of the Many-Breasted. These would show The Solstice, when the ray of rising sun Touched first this brick or that. Inside its walls The House of Gods should spread a spacious Court, By narrow doors and by strait ways approached, Where, if he would, with five-score fighting men Hamilcar might withstand the land in arms; And, if they would, in days of peace, the Priests Might on due altars, and in close-shut shrines Pay Gods, and eke the Seven Nameless Ones Homage and worship. The sites we set; Handselled the quarries; hired the meaner sort To chip and square, for all must be dry work, No binding clay or lime, lest seeds blow in And saplings, rooting in the joints, should grow, Rending its face. But this when all is wrought Shall stand as the eternal mountains stand Unchanged, and tell the centuries to come How Hiram builded on ZimbabwÃª Hill. END OF THE FIFTH DAY THE SIXTH DAY Ithobal, reaching the world's end, A spacious harbour doth befriend; Southward no more, but Northward now Turneth his storm-tossed vessels prow. Glory and length of days, Great King, to thee! The High Gods give thee victory and peace And all Thy heart's desires! The ship I sent Came to thy coastsâher precious freight unspiltâ After nine moons: so hadst Thou tidings, Lord, Writ thee in gold from Ithobal, thy slave. I, with two galleys launched, my Ram and Dove, Stood southward yet again. Hiram abode To build, and Hamilcar to keep the guard; While, for those thirty Tyrians sent ashore And lost ones in my crews by land and sea By water or in battle, by wild beasts, Or slain by sun, or sickly marish airs; As many from the native folk I took, Freemen and slaves; well-moulded ones, enured To toil and trial. Some with Hanno filled The empty benches of the Ram; and some Joined service in the Silver Dove. We quit The friendly river, well caparisoned, Stuffed to the wales with stores: sails renovate, Cordage new-coiled; masts, rigging, all a-taunt: And those brave spirits that did wend with me At this by danger's salt so seasoned down; So wont to take the terror and the sport With equal mind that, if the end were death, Then death should be good port. The weaker ones, In such stout company, lacked time to fear: Sufficient if they followed Ithobal And Lady Nesta; if their daily mess Came warm and comforting when oars were ranged; And on the deck or beach, in noisy dance, Their feet kept time to the drum. Yet we were come So far, Lord Pharaoh, that it frighted me! What had befell the Sun? Thy Spring on Nile Is Autumn at that bound: thy Winter here Shines Summer there: for this my thought was ripe. Well wot our Tyrian mariners that Bel Goes through his constellations, moon by moon, From Ram and Crab to Fishes. But, dread King! Already at ZimbabwÃª, in its sky Of fiercest weather, overhead the Orb So swung that either shadow was not cast, Or cast to southward; and when week by week My keels still ploughed those never-ending fields Of the wine-coloured main; still clomb the slopes Of glassy waves, to plunge forever down Through the sea-lace and spume; still saw the shore Glide, ghostlike, shadowy, grey, interminable, Bound by its girdle of a beach, or walled With dreadful crags; and while the last stars dippedâ Of those we knewâunder the rim; and stars Nameless, fresh to our eyes flashed into ken, The heart of this thy servant Ithobal Melted ofttimes to water. Twice and thrice, Lone on the poop, I beat my breast and cried:â âWe come too far!â But, never once dismayed, My Lady kept good courage. âThou,â she laughed, âCaptain of all the Captains, sailest here Farther than what was Nesta's farthest; yet Sound are thy Ships: the sky hath still its Sun The winds come fair: thy willing rowers go Whithersoever thou dost steer. I saw Our Silver Dove of Ishtar on the stem Thrice stretch her bright wings in this morning's gold, As hungering for what glory never bird And never vessel found before. Sweet Lord! Hold thy great heart! The coast doth know itself; Its simple peoples pass, repass and talk: Keep heart! I have a thing to comfort thee. Less than five hundred leagues will bring us where The long shore bends; and, trailing South no more, Goes by a mightly horn, a Cape of Storms, Laved with a wave that rolls from the World's End Westward beneath a flat-topped mount, then turns Northward and north and north, thy homeward way.â So sped we onward all those weary leagues; Now fanned by airs which hardly broke the blue, Now scourged by storms which rent the ocean floor, And drove its hissing hills, all flake and foam In headlong wrath. Anon, 'twas breath of Heaven, As if the Gods had thereabouts trooped down, By golden stairways of the clouds, to dwell 'Midst their own weather in such Paradise Of dimpled sapphire wavelets, whose white lips Kissed the smooth Shore and jewelled her with shells. Then, whether it were life or fearful death Waiting beyond for us in that dropped veil Of the sea's distant purple none took heed, None scanted meal nor did forego his song, His dance and music: since if this were Fate Sweet were it so to end. Anon, 'twould seem, In tempest, or the terror of the surf Bursting beneath our lee,âso close we saw Our grave-place in the rocksâas if Hope died In gloom behind us, and in face of us Despair did point to Hell. Yet not for that Was any oar-loom dropped: was any thigh Thrust at the bench-board with less manlihood. From chief to slave, ship-boy to timoneer, These gave their souls with me to what so keeps The souls of brave men safe. In pleasant times The songs that Egypt hears, or Sidon sings Kept our blades dancing. On the evil days When we must run for shelter, not the winds, Piping outside the reef where we would hide, Could howl my children's cheering down. Thus, Lord, All those five hundred leagues of unseen sea In forty days thy galleys overpassed, Till, sailing free, a light air from the North, Daylight just dim, we see the unending coast Break to the right, away, far, far away: Ahead, no land at all. The wide sea rolls Steadfastly westward, in long hills and dales So that with steep ascent we climb, to glide By slope as steep into the trough of blue: So deep ship sees not ship until they ride Once again balanced on the curling crest. No land to South, nor East; Westward we spy White beaches and grey cliffs with hills behind And forests hanging in the clouds. All day The strong swell helps the wind to waft us on Till there was brought abreast a wall of cliff, Cape of Good Hope. Dark-hued, three hundred cubits tall-a peak Pointing each flank. O Pharaoh! now I know That rocky ramp with its twin peaks on guard Was of all Africa her utmost earth; Was back-gate of the World; was where to turn,â If the Gods willedâto find a homeward way And come alive out of that nether death. Even as we drew inshore, the sun went down Far on our right: no man had seen that thing In Syria or in Egypt. Crouching low My grey-haired steersman hid his face and prayed. But Nesta, holding fast the golden charm Which helped her with her Gods, laughed low and said:â âMaster! we have out-travelled even Bel! The Sun-God is more weary than thy ships: He sleepeth short of us. And see! where stalks A tawny lion on yon grassy knoll Hanging above the surf! Know ye that sign? It is the Lord of Libya come to look On men that have a heart within their breasts Greater than lions.â As she spake, the clouds, Gathering tumultuous o'er the distant ridge, Stooped and let out a blast from forth the West Full in our faces, driving down the swell, Tearing its grey crests off in seething spray. And with the wind the hailâgreat stones of iceâ That pelted decks and scourged the smarting sea, And beat the billows flat, bringing amain A new fierce turmoil of such waves as seemed Each one a ruin. All our sails were furled; Deck-hatches shut; fast-sealed the rowing-ports; While our two banks of Thalamites in turn Strained blades to keep us heading. If we broached, The seas must come aboard, the o'er-whelmed craft Must founder. Never saw thy servant yet A deadlier run of breakers; by His name Who dwells at Ascalon, I did not hope To view another sun; butâmore to cheerâ Myself I seized the steering oar and held As best I might the Silver Dove to the wind. Surely we had been lost, when Nesta plucked My sleeve, and pointed where aboard his Ram Good Hanno showed us safety. Not in vain Summers and winters long on the Mid Sea The salt had bleached his hair; the savage deep Taught him its secrets. Axe in hand he cut His mast and gear away; lashed round the wreck His anchor rope, and, casting overboard, Had veered the raffle forward through the waves, And making fast on the stem-head, he rode Secure by this sea anchor, whose defence Broke the rough brine and kept the gallant ship Steadfast to windward. We, too, likeways did, Cutting away our mast and launching it With sail and gear and rigging over side; Till, like the Ram, at cable's-end the Dove Hung, plunging to the angry wash, sore tossed, But saved. Thus did we drift the wild night through, And all a dismal day, and that next night, Till morning brought us peace, with promise fair Of easy shelter; since a spacious bay Table Bay. Opened its green arms for us to the left; Whereto, hacking away our wreck, we stood, Much labouring, for the sea ran strong; and faint Were hearts and arms, yet life is sweet to save, And this my lady on the bench by me Plied the same oar-loom with her dark small hands, What time, with cries of joy, the two ships shot Clear of the surge, under a shelving hill, Which shut us into quiet. 'Twas a spot Stamped on the tablet of my soul by stress Of utmost peril finding end in peace. From head to head the gateway of the bay Spreads a large league. An island Robben Island. to the east Sentinels that approach; inside a plain Where one might build a stately city, King! To keep the keys of all that Nether World. Beyond it soars aloft a mountain mass, Flat at the top like some prodigious roof, This side and that side ending suddenly With precipices sheer, which plunge adown, Till from their feet another rounded slope Rises this way and that. The northward spur Takes form as if a lion's head did lift From shaggy shoulders; to the south the hill Hath such a shape as shows, in chine and haunch, A couchant lion. Far away are peaks With wooded uplands and deep valleys, decked By blossoming heaths, flame-coloured aloe-spears, And garlands of wild grape. The country folk, Simple and friendly, clad in skins or bark Gave us fair welcome. 'Twas their winter time; But the air mild and still, save when a cloud Gathered upon the Table Mount, whereat A savage west wind howled, and there would hap Tempest and hail. Well pleased, we did abide In port of that good hope; and, from a wood Plucked straight-grown spars to make us masts again, And trimmed and fashioned these, and set them up Firm as before, using for stays and shrouds The twisted strips of hide cut in the green; Made good our broken oars; recaulked our seams; The weary crews refreshed; filled full anew The water-pots and meal-jars. Store was, too, Of dried meat and of honey. When Gods give They give with both hands filled. A year had fled And half a year, in sunshine and in storm, Great Pharaoh! since we left thy sea of Suph. Here was the end of earth! would the sea-road Lead homeward all the way to North and thee? Was there a westward path of unbarred main Like to that eastern path, which we might cleave And come to happy finish, and thy feet? Or must we perish in the trackless deep And thou not know, and no man living hear Where in the dark Ithobal lost thy ships? The shore-folk could not teach. Only they said Traders and tribesmen, wandering from the West Spake of blue sea, blue sea, always blue sea, And coasts that stretched and stretched to northward. None In their frail shallops ever dared to round That neighbourhood cantle, where the rolling South The roaring West encountered, and the tides Breasted so high they seemed to mock the hills. If we would die, 'twere best to wait a breeze Blows from the east when the great mountain doffs Its cap of clouds, and so steal out from clutch Of the sea-demons. Peradventure peace Might be upon us till the land was turned, And then that would befall which must befall. So we made sacrifice, and on a dawn, All gold and saffron, let our painted sails Fill to a favouring wind, and driving safe Over smooth billows, ran the coast adown And made the headland well, and shifted course Straight for the North. Seven days the good breeze held; Seven nights the moon of Ishtar gleamed for us. Then, lacking water and our rowers spent, Under an island green, and white, and red, Found we fair shelter. Sea-birds nested there: Strange breeds Penguins. with paddle wings and silken necks, Whose speckled eggs made the men pleasant feasts. And next came mists blotting out sea and land; And next, I most remember one low point, Tree-fringed, which swarmed with apes; the furry folk Pelted us from the tree-tops with ripe nuts, Chattering vain war. A river, after that, So thronged with elephants browsing its banks, That 'twas as though the sandhills swayed and paced. Were we but hunters there was ivory To build a throne for Egypt. Then a stream Orange River. The folk named âGolden Watersâ; here a bar Shut its wide reaches from the thundering main: So spread they to a vast lagoon where, sooth! All feathered folk of Earth did seem to dwell. For clouds the sky had fowls. They soared or swam, Or waded in the shallows, spearing fish,â Myriads and myriads: while upon the plain Those cattle of the Gods,âthe dappled deer,â Were all the citizens. And, like the land Where man's foot cometh not, the seas hereat Swarmed with bright life: in the air the albatross Stretched wings to wind like two pale galley sails: Or skimmed with yellow webs from crest to crest, Or poised asleep in the scud. And, at a gut, Where breeze and current laid a course for us, Under a monstrous cliff, steep to the surf, We held all day a merry company Of racing dolphins, like black swine of the wave, At gambol in the green: such glee of life! Such joyous pigs of Dagon, that I stayed The hand of one who aimed a shaft at them. And farther on, whole islands white as snow With droppings of the sea-fowl. Then a ledge So thick with forms, half fish, half woman-wise, Sleek-headed, melon-breasted, with dark eyes Lustrous and soft, thou wouldst have thought them maids Gendered by Sea-Gods upon river-nymphs, Till the broad tails waved and they plunged,âthe seals! And nigh a bayâwas called the Whale-Fish Bayâ We passed an islet, one huge marble rock Hollow as is a temple-court, with halls And shrines and corridors and cloisters high, Filled with dim greenish light; its walls and roofs Carved by a thousand tempests into dome, Pinnacle, plinth, and ponderous architrave, Whereof the entrance was a gateway beamed By split slabs and a lintel ragged, vast; The door-posts' weathered columns cut by waves Grand as Thy Memphis. Into this the main, Pouring its billows, lashed the floor to foam; Spurted in milky fountains through the clefts; Streamed in wan cataracts from shelf and coign; All with such monstrous roar as if the Deep Came there to speak, and bid us stay our quest, With terrible commanding. Farther north We beached on the white horn of a wide bay, Where sand-banks spread, and coral rocks awash Broke the long swells on matted weed. Shewhales Flocked there to calve. By Him of Gaza, Lord! Rare sight it was to see those monstrous dams Shoulder the shallow water, sailing in To bring to birth. No fish are these, O King! No more than bat is bird because it flies; No more than scaly crocodiles have fins Because they swim. We had a mariner Well seen in whales: a sailor oft on Suph And in the Midland Sea. He showed us how The Gods have framed Leviathan a beast, Albeit of the deep. These giant-shes Brought forth like women; suckled young at teats Down by the vent; had nipples like a nurse; And, so Bilhadad showed, because the calves Sucked ill in water, could at will force milk Into the youngling's throat. He taught us how The thick white fat was wrapped over the frame To keep the creature's blood at heating point; And how the creature's blood at heating point; Athwart, not lengthwise, for the better speed In rising and descending. Also, King! These monsters, placable, find bloodless food In what the deep hath smallest and least seen; Since every wave is filled with forms minuteâ Shining by nightâas is the air with gnats. These and the other unregarded orts Of Ocean's face the whale eats; to that endâ So crafty go the Gods,âBilhadad showed, He hath no teeth, but in the cavernous mouth Ridges of bending bone, finished by shreds, Whalebone. By strings, and fringes, flexed inside the lips To make the mouth all sieve. So will he gulp A billow in his jaws, and, closing them, Sift the brine forth by nostril and by lip, To gain a pouchful. Were their appetites Vast as their bulk, woe would it be, meseems, For weaker tribes. One great whale misconceived My Silver Dove to be her cub, and rolled Motherly sides against us, breaking short A score of oar-blades. North,âstill north we sped With many a stay, till the âBlack Capeâ Cape Negro. was made, A dark rock jutting from a sandy neck, With friendly frith behind. Thence, past low woods And shores by long swells lashed, into a port Lobito named, where it was good to be. We go ashore for meat; some ambuscade Brown reed-buck in the canes; some, lance in hand, Follow the moist and perilous paths whereby The river-horses wend. Some haul the net Along the yellow sands, or bait great hooks To take the shark. Yet none for forest lore Or sylvan skill matched our bright Lady here. We, with a band, went inland,âthree days' marchâ To spy the country or if trade might be. But naked was it all, barren, and burned: No life except the lizard's on the stone, The vulture's in the sky. At that third eve,â The path being lost, the water-bags all dry, Food failing and the sun at act to set,â My temper bent. âBy Thammuz's blood!ââI swore, âIthobal is of stuff Gods use for fools Since, Nesta, he hath led thee and these friends To die a-thirst and hungry in the waste.â On this she smiled. If one had lightly laughed At Ithobal in wrath,âone lip but hers,â Blood would have washed it out; but not a whit Her dark eyes quailed as mine flung round to her. âGood Lord!â spake she, âthy ships have girdled now Two parts, out of the three, of Africa, And thou wilt knot the silver cincture tight At Pharaoh's foot-stool. Yet for all thy skill The treasures of my home thou readest not. See! where we stand is meat and drink enough To have and spare, if well ye wot the signs, As little children do, finding the breast For all that lawns and sindons may conceal.â Thereat she stepped three paces, touched with foot A glossy dark green creeper, flat of leaf, Tendrilled along a hollow in the sand, With knotty nuts upon it, half a score. âThis is the nara,â quoth she, âdig and dig, And ye shall find sweet water at its roots, Half a bow's length beneath. Also its fruit Is comforting and good. But for more need, Look yonder, Master, where a thin line juts Against the golden sun. A branch ye thought? A spray of goat-grass? Nay, dear brave dull eyes, Yon is an estridge neck. I clap my hands, The loutish housewife rises and makes off, Who hath prepared the evening meal for us.â She laughed and shouted loud; the great bird starts, With fluttered plumes and cackling beak, and flies; And while some dig the water, King! we find A score of great new ivory eggs, the clutch Of many a hen; so sup on lavish fare. North again, north we row. The new stars sink; Old stars begin to rise; past long white cliffs Athwart quick Bengo's mouth; under a rock Yellow as sulphur, with black hanging woods, And then by shores, striped red and white, we win Into discoloured seas. A mighty flood Pours from the land, staining the blue waves brown, And bearing broken trunks and whirling round Patches of rooted grass and reeds. High up We see, inshore, long-reaching stretch of stream That shows no farther bank. It is the mouth Of a right mighty river; Congo. not thy Nile Hath nobler gateway, Pharaoh! to the deep. At the point's hither side opens a cove Where turtles breed. We beach our ships i' the smooth And pitch a camp. Presently flock the folk Naked, shock-headed, speaking words uncouth, Friendly but curious. Gondah trades with them, Cloth, and brass wire, and beads for kids, and meal. 'Midst these a grey-haired wanderer from the wasteâ Beareth the Eastern face,âhath journeyed far, Knoweth the mighty stream and nameth it EnzaddiââMother of all Waters,ââsaith It riseth out of great lakes far away, Bemba and Bangweoloârunneth vast, Full-volumed, fertilizing, rich with woods, Seven hundred leagues, and twice doth fling its bulk Down monstrous rock-walls. When this ancient spies The tribe-mark tinctured blue on nesta's arm, Prone falleth he to earth, kisseth her foot, Saith in strange tongue words that well pleased the ear Of the listening Lady. âTruly he hath come,â She whispers, âfrom the East Sea to the West, His eyes have seen the breadth of Africa; A Makalanga too! 'tis wonderful!â That night, as many nights before, we sate Girt by a fence of thorns, in light robes wrapt, The camp-fires brightly burning, flinging sparks Into the murk, and lighting trees and tents, While the wide river and the meeting sea Made us a sleep-song. Other voices too The lonely Libyan night hath; creatures wild, That hate the sun, make by the moon and stars Their hunting time. You heard the river-horse Splash in the reeds; the owl hoot from his branch; The grey fox bark; the earth-bear whine and sniff; The apes,âfour-handed people of the woodâ Fretfully chatter; then the spotted dog Utter his devilish laugh, and the lynx scream, Till near at hand the lion, lord of beasts, Lays muzzle on the ground, and roars a peal Of angry thunder, rolling round the hills, Hushing the frighted wilderness. Far off, His neighbour lions catch the thunder up, And with fierce answers shake the shuddering ground. As so we lay with those rough voices ringed, The watch-fires gleaming back from the green eyes That showed and shone and vanished, Nesta raised Her eyelids from what seemed a dream, and asked:â âKnow'st thou, my Master! what the lions say? They have been kings: they are the kings to-night; All this is theirs; the river and its reeds, The hills, the thickets, and the roaming game, The village people and their livesâall's theirs, And this dark world must listen when they speak, Will listen many an age. Yet it is spite Makes them to roar so bitter; centuries pass Like moons at last, and after centuries The lions know that down this stream will come A white man bringing to the darkness dawn As doth the morning star; opening the gates Which shut my people in, till good times hap, When cattle-bells, and drums, and festal songs Of peaceful people, dwelling happily, Shall be the desert's voice both day and night: The lions know and roar their hate of it. Hark! Ist-a-la-ni! Ist-a-la-ni! cries The Marsh Hen: knowing who will come at last; And wolves snarlâdreaming of âthe Stone-Breaker.ââ Native name of Sir H. M. Stanley. END OF THE SIXTH DAY THE SEVENTH AND LAST DAY Ithobal, braving dread and doubt Hath sailed all Africa about: The thirty-seventh moon doth bring The Tyrian crews to Egypt's King. May the King live for ever! Ithobal A little longer prays the Royal ear That he may tell the wondrous finishing Of this great travel: how thy ships came home, Most Mighty! to the land which sent them forth. Twenty-six moons had waxed and waned. 'Twas Bul, The third month, when we left Enzaddi's mouth, And once more followed wheresoever led That ceaseless coast. Too long it were to name Journey by journey, changeful stage by stage, What lands, what seas, unfolded from the void Their new-shewn pictures; what strange chances fell; What sudden perils. Each day was a scroll With cares laborious and hard toils unsealed, Whereon the high Gods wrote that which they would. Yet with our vessels fresh-accoutred, gear Made good, sails mended, meal and meat in store, And those companion breasts tempered to brass By hardships and a hundred rescuings, Safe wended we, and fearless, all those leagues From the great river's mouth. Rose the Red Point, Past tall Zeudana's bluff; across a bay Where seven black rocks stand up, we spy a nook Cup-shaped, the crater of some fiery mount, Which burned itself to stillness ages gone. Where flame, and rage, and ravage, had been fierce, We lay embosomed, under white cliffs laced With tender film of ferns, and delicate buds, Purple, or gold, or rose, of climbing plants, Whereon birds, small as bees, sucked honey-blooms With long-curved bills: themselves finer than flowers, So painted and so gemmed. Thus, where had boiled The molten rock, and sulphurous fumes had belched, The sea lay tranquil as in mother's lap, Whom the babe sucks asleep: so doth the Deep Shift its large humours. Also, King! I saw A marvel here. Who hath before us known A shellfish slay a man? The shore folk use In companies, or one by one, to search The coral-banks for food; at low tide these Are live with lowly creatures of the deep, Sea-flowers, sea-worms, sea-slugs, and cuttle-fish; At flood the waves wash all. There is a shell Tridacna Gigas. Twin-valved, prodigious, white, with fluted lips, Russet outside, hides in the bladder-weed; Clam-like, the body of it fleshy, strong, The cup a cubit broad. This thing lurks there With opened edge waiting what meat the spray Will waft it: fed or handled, it doth close With grip of iron jaw. We saw a wretch Lie drowned upon the reef, one black foot caught In the toothed shell; the hapless carcass cast Limp on the rocks, like a brown sea-weed blade. He, wading to his shallop, planted step On the clam's shell, and this, grasping him hard Had chained him till the slow sea rose and choked. Later I spake with those wise in the ways Of coast and current; people of the beach Who taught us we were come to where the shore, Not longer trending northward, turns and leads Straight towards the setting sun; seven hundred leagues Some did suppose, or five, or six, some said. Yet, if we chanced the fortune of good airs, And struck across, well-watered and well-stored, Rowing by night and day when fair winds failed, Either on high sea we should founder, lost; Or, by bold venture 'scape a two moons' toil, Skirting Biafra and deep-bayed Benin. Which, sooth! we did; first coming happily, At seven-score leagues, to a long island laid Over against Arangaâ'tis a stream Runs from the inner hills. Cape Lopez. And yet anew We pushed forth hazarding, and crossed sea-wastes, Which in the hurricane heave mountainous, But now slept blue and smooth. Nearing that coast The blue waxed grey and brown; the white foam foulâ Long ere the topmost distant peak was eyedâ With flooding forth of some great stream River Niger. that sent The rains of half her Libya to the main By many a mouth. With the land-water blew The land-wind, and the muddied waves lapped low Across the face of Benin all the way To Eko Island. Lagos. Yet one marvel more I had foregone, Great Pharaoh! to recount. Behold these hides which my slaves lay at foot Of thy Royal seat,âskins brown and dunâwe stripped The shaggy coverings from the strangest beast Thy servant's eyes have seen. Nigh to that streamâ Zaire or Enzaddiâopens in the land A deep laguna, fenced afar with hills, And fed by water-ways, which wind and creep Through forests dark with giant trees, and hung From glade to glade with curtains of grey moss And snake-like climbing vines. In its dense shades, Lord of the gloom, there dwells a monstrous ape, Gorilla. Ugly and dreadful, in his strength most fierce, But man-like, fashioned wholly as a man, A wide flat face, small ears, a hairy crown, Nostrils of blackamoor, and human ways: Short-legged with mighty loins and arms that reach To touch his shin as he doth walk erect. For walk he doth, with woodland staff in palm, Most like a savage forester; the hand Short-thumbed, but framed to skilful purposes, Hath a so stubborn grip that he can grasp The python's throat and squeeze its life away Spite of its writhing coils; or break a jaw Of bounding leopard. In the tree he builds A nest of boughs; there keeps his sylvan home His one ill-favoured wife, children, and store Of forest fruit. Yet though the creature eats No food save roots and berries, not a beast So mad, so dangerous. The lion shrinks To cover, seeing on its hunting-path This âMan of the Woodsâ approach, rough staff in hand, And huge arms aching for some foe to slay. The twain who wore these coats my comrades met Where no tree gave them refuge, so they fought Two against ten, and ere they yielded breath, Cracked the neckbone of one, and ripped up one Among my hunters, dying savagely With cries like wounded men. At Eko Isle Once more we saw the gem of Ishtar gleam Above the marge, the North Star. Speeding thence, Through fair and foul we pass Whydah's lagoon; Cast anchor in a river flowing down From Ningo Hill. Here are a savage folk, Dahoms and Ashantees, eating men's flesh; Filling the drink-bowls of their gods with blood; Cities of skulls and slaughter. Joyfully We parted from the cruel land; set course For Accra, for Amkwana; rock and bay Of hot Secondi, and the Three Point cape. Next the Assini stream with spacious lakes Behind its sands. Then ever westward came Long rampart of red cliffs, Yawoda cragâ Striped rose and white like a flamingo's wingâ Jutting to sea. Here is the Ivory coast, Abode of elephants; at Nano town, Which hath its huts on bank of Berebi, Door-posts and lintels were of milky tusks, And tusks lay heaped in sheds, and tusks did mark One man's field from another's; these I deemed Were spoils of elephants which die of age. One lordly brute of the vast herds we spied Might sack and scatter Nano. Still our coast Went westward till we make the Cape of Palms Cape Palmas.â Tree-capped, tied to the shore by thread of sand: Behind its groves a river good for rest. A strange lure cheated us in nearing. Grey The mist lay round the cape; in its faint veil The rocks and reefs, the banks and beaches, hung, With trees and towns and hills in the still air. It was the lying light, the mirage; such Mocks thirsty desert men, drawn from their path By vision of fair water, shadowing palms And men and temples. I had deemed all true Till Nesta said, âHave heed, Master! of this At entering; 'tis a trick of fiends who dwell In storm-clouds and the evil weather.â Now Once more the Ram and Dove upon our prows Looked homeward; once more northerly we steer. By Monkey Island, and by Wappi Head, Wended we well to Butu, and a stream, PobÃ¢mo named, next Tembo, and some isles Green with bananas; so by many a stage We sight a promontory, forest-clad With great hills piercing heaven; 'tis the mount Of lions. Sierra Leone. Northward of the dark green ridge Opens a stream, and I must enter there For that the Silver Dove hath sprung a leak. Yestereve and all night by some ill-hap Came in the sea, and soaked our grain, and swamped The forward hold, till half my oarsmen baled, And half were rowing. In the stream we find A shelving shore, and beached. 'Sooth! strange to see! It is a sword-fish that hath wrought us this, Nigh ruining our venture. Yea! a fish Six cubits long that hath for nose a beak Bony, shaped like a sword, sharp like a sword And hard as tempered steel; strong fins and tail That in its times of anger and attack Drive it like arrow through the waves. It hates The whale; mistook us for its enemy; And dealt us deadly thrust. The blade had gone Through half a cubit of fir plank and oakâ Loosening a beam endâwhere the sea poured in. The fish had broken off; his sword stood out A span clear in the hold. By Matakongâ A lovely isle with sloping lawns and grovesâ We pass to Pongo, and the channel made By safe Arango. Next was BulamÃ  And Jeba river; then long stretch of sands To Kisamanze and the Gambia, By Dakar and Goree to a green cape Cape Verde.â Slopes from the sea-shore towards two rounded paps O'er-looking isle and bay. Here came thy ships Westermost, Mighty Pharaoh! of their road: Nothing lay west of us except a main Known only to the Sun, which dippeth there Under the World. And thence to Senegal And her white headland, Cape Blanco. and red Bojador, Eastward the shore now bends. Cape Juby lifts A green hill, and a stream flows to the sea Beneath white banks. Onward by Mogador We mark huge Atlas rear his snowy neck To hold the sky aloft: this side and that The lean grey hills peer over to the brine To gaze on voyagers whose ships are come From other hills so far: from other shores Which watch the Day spring from another East. Then as I stood upon my steering deck Eyeing the bare crags pass, and new peaks spring Out of the blue, Nesta was by my side, And took my hand whispering: âMaster! I saw Good omen at the dawn. Kneeling to pray, When the first gold lit on Astarte's bird Which is upon our stem, I marked her stretch Her silver wings to all their glittering length, And arch her shining neck, and utter low The love-note of a Dove; I think she hears Some home sounds in the air, or seeth that Which promiseth us rest.â Even as she spake, What mark I? On the left two pointed hills, Facing them, seven low tops; and in their front A black cliff Cape Spartel. rising from the rippled blue, Which suddenly is narrowed so that land, To left as well as right, hangs in the sky, A violet film: a film which gathers form, Deepens to green and purple, and then grows A huge rock, Gibraltar. like a couching lion, set Over against the cliff. I know! I know! Here is the Ocean-Gate! Here is the Strait, Twice before seen, where goes the Middle Sea Unto the Setting Sun and the Unknownâ No more unknown. Ithobal's ships have sailed Around all Africa. Our task is done! These are the Pillars! this the Midland Sea! The road to Tyre is yonder! Every wave Is homely. Yonder, sure, Old Nilus pours Into this sea the Waters of a World, Whose secret is his own, and thine and mine. Great Lord! no need to tell thee how we came By coasts familiar, and by well-tried paths, Quit of our quest. Thirty-five moons had waned Since we sailed forth of Suph. My two brave ships Kept the sea safe. The third, if the Gods pleased, Deep ballasted with gold, was back with thee. Out of my sixteen-score of gallant souls There lacked some five-score, lost by land or sea, In battle slain, or torn by prowling beasts, Or dead by evil airs; and one I slew, The traitor Nimroud. Of our native aids The most are lusty, well-contented, free, Glad to be part of this high enterprise, And see the great new world. But most I bless The holy Gods above and my fair Star, Because I carry back, unharmed, serene, Radiant with joy at this our victory And thine, O King of Kings! her who was Life And Soul, and Guide, and Good of all we did: My Lady Nesta of the noble heart. Ah! like to one who dreams that he must die, And waking finds him at a golden feast; Or like to one whose hapless eyes have lost The lovely light of day, when sudden gleam Of the world's joy and glory comes again, And all his darkness dies; so was it now, Great Pharaoh! with thy servants, day by day, Conning the happy sea-signs. What to us Any more irked the straining at the oar, The narrow bed, the hard-worn plank, the toil To beach and unbeach? In our ragged sails Flapped triumph: in our oar-ports, worn to gloss By oar-looms grinding through five thousand leagues, Shone pride. My merry rowers loved the ships So staunch, so faithful, and so friendly grownâ Their good sea-houses. Pipe and drum kept time More lively than before to the light song Of Thalamite and Zeugite, as we skimmed Over the autumn waters to that mouth, Where thy broad Nilus voids his western wave; And battered, torn and lean, but jubilant, Joyous, and eager for the grace of thisâ To see thy face and kneel before thy feet, And lay thee, for thy favour and thy trust, The Secret of the Unknown Earth made known. For this we did rejoice: for this are here. All this did Hodo with a heedful pen, On the papyrus write, finishing:â Then On ending of the seventh day of the story Our Lord the King, sitting in state and glory, Rose from his throne, and in his robe and crown, With gentle smiling majesty came down. Before him on their faces that good day Ithobal and his people lowly lay, The Lady Nesta and his Captains two, And in a ring behind their sea-stained crew: And yet behind, the negroes and the slaves, While on the stones their bows and spears and glaives, Rusted in battle, lay; with wild-beast hides And bars of gold and pearls, and what besides Their sea spoils were. And our Lord Pharaoh laid Ithobal's head upon his breast, and said:â âIthobal, Son of Magon! for thy King, Lo! thou hast wrought a wondrous famous thing, Vaster than victories; I name thee chief Of all my navies, and I give thee fief Of lands along my Nilus, grove and field, Such as shall royal wealth and greatness yield; As many schÅnes as on the dreadful sea Thou hast accomplished of leagues for me.â Then did our gracious Lord raise by the hand The lady, speaking soft:âWe understand Thy wisdom, Daughter! and thy work and worth; Thou art not of our Egypt by thy birth, But shalt be, for thy deeds, and by my grace Princess and Priestess in a chosen place: I make thee Lady hence of Amen-ru; Thine now the shrine, and thine its revenue.â Afterwards many a gift with liberal word Amongst those others did our mighty Lord Bestow; and bade AahmesâChamberlainâ Pour largesse for them, gold and robes and grain, And palace meats for life; the slaves set free; Hanno and SothÃ«s, officers to be; Handah and Gondah by rich boons repaid; A house and dowry for each faithful maid, Asenath and her fellow. There withal A bounteous feast was set in Pharaoh's hall; And all the city kept high revelry Till the moon clomb into the starry sky. (NESTA is heard singing) Under Astarte's moon, At the soft night's silvery noon Sleepeth my city of Neith, The city of Pharaoh slumbereth; The palms are like columns black With the dark-blue heaven at their back, And the shadows of porch and wall On the porphyry pavements fall Like purple carpets of silence. No lack Of joy in the white-walled street Where townsman and kinsman meet: And the houses are busy with what they say Of the marvellous, glorious, goodly array When Ithobal stood before the Throne And for seven days opened a world unknown. This marvellous tale of the Far-away And the secrets of Gods all shown. In his palace Lord Pharaoh is glad For the splendour of this gain had. In their huts the people are proud For the fame of this deed, long and loud, Which shall make them renowned alway. In harbour the galleys lie Safe under the spangled sky; Each weary sea-worn keel No longer doth fret, or feel The smiting wave and the mournful sigh Of the tempest which gathers to wreck. Steady and smooth is each deck; The tired sails sleep, and the painted eye On each red prow is at rest. For all is come to the best And no more dangers to search and spy. The oars themselves seemed to keep A pleasure and peace in their sleep As the moonbeams shine on the glistening oar-ports nigh. And I, happy Nesta, the while Sit in the sight of Nile, In the marble temple of Amen-ru: For I am the priestess, and what I do With the lands and temple and town Is done henceforth with mine own. And Ithobal's head is on my lap; The Gods have given good hap; I am here with my Lover and Lord and King, And our tale to the sistrum I sing; There shall never be nobler told or shown; For now are the Strange Seas known. THE END</field>
