      <field name="fulltext">RHYMES ABOUT A LITTLE WOMAN She is my pride; my plague: my rest; my rack: my bliss; my bane: She brings me sunshine of the heart: and soft'ning of the brain. RHYMES ABOUT A LITTLE WOMAN I She's very, very beautiful; but—alas!— Isn't it a pity that her eyes are glass? And her face is only wax, coloured up, you know; And her hair is just a fluff of very fine tow! No!—she's not a doll. That will never do— Never, never, never, for it is not true! Did they call you a doll? Did they say that to you? Oh, your eyes are little heavens of an earth made new; Your face, it is the blossom of mortal things; Your hair might be the down from an angel's wings! Oh, yes; she's beauti-beautiful! What else could she be? God meant her for Himself first, then gave her to me. II She was a treasure; she was a sweet; She was the darling of the Army and the Fleet! When—she—smiled The crews of the line-of-battle ships went wild! When—she—cried— Whole regiments reversed their arms and sighed! When she was sick, for her sake The Queen took off her crown and sobbed as if her heart would break. III Look at her shoulders now they are bare; Are there any signs of feathers growing there? No, not a trace; she cannot fly away; This wingless little angel has been sent to stay. IV What shall we do to be rid of care? Pack up her best clothes and pay her fare; Pay her fare and let her go By an early train to Jer-I-Cho. There in Judæa she will be Slumbering under a green palm-tree; And the Arabs of the Desert will come round When they see her lying on the ground, And some will say, “Did you ever see Such a remark-a-bil babee?” And others, in the language the Arabs use, “Nous n'avons jamais vu une telle papoose!” And she will grow and grow; and then She will marry a chief of the Desert men; And he will keep her from heat and cold, And deck her in silk and satin and gold— With bangles for her feet and jewels for her hair, And other articles that ladies wear! So pack up her best clothes, and let her go By an early train to Jer-I-Cho! Pack up her best clothes, and pay her fare; So we shall be rid of trouble and care! V Take the idol to her shrine; In her cradle lay her! Worship her—she is divine; Offer up your prayer! She will bless you, bed and board, If befittingly adored. VI On a summer morning, Babsie up a tree In came a Blackbird, sat on Babsie's knee. Babsie to Blackbird—“Blackbird, how you do?” Blackbird to Babsie—“Babsie, how was you? “How was you in this commodious tree— “How was you and all your famu—ilu—ee?” VII This is the way the ladies ride— Saddle-a-side, saddle-a-side! This is the way the gentlemen ride— Sitting astride, sitting astride! This is the way the grandmothers ride— Bundled and tied, bundled and tied! This is the way the babbykins ride— Snuggled inside, snuggled inside! This is the way, when they are late, They all fly over a five-barred gate! VIII We are not wealthy, but, you see, Others are far worse off than we. Here's a gaberlunzie begging at the door— If we gave him Babs, he'd need no more! Oh, she'll fill your cup, and she'll fill your can; She'll make you happy, happy! Take her, beggar man! Give a beggar Babsie? Give this child away? That would leave us poor, and poor, for ever and a day! After-thought— The gaberlunzie man is sad; The Babe is far from glee; He with his poverty is plagued— And with her poor teeth As who should say “poortith.” she! IX Oh, where have you been, and how do you do, And what did you beg, or borrow, or buy For this little girl with the sash of blue? Why, A cushie-coo; and a cockatoo; And a cariboo; and a kangaroo; And a croodlin' doo; and a quag from the Zoo— And all for the girl with the sash of blue! X When she's very thirsty, what does she do? She croons to us in Doric; she murmurs “A-coo!” Oh, the little Scotch girl, who would ever think She'd want a coo—a whole coo—needing but a drink! Moo, moo!—a coo! Mammie's gone to market; Mammie'll soon be here; Mammie's bought a brindled coo! Patience, woman dear! Don't you hear your Crummie lowing in the lane? She's going up to pasture; we'll bring her home again! Moo, moo!—a coo! Grow sweet, you little wild flowers, about our Crummie's feet; Be glad, you green and patient grass, to have our Crummie eat; And hasten, Crummie, hasten, or what shall I do? For here's a waesome lassie skirlin' for a coo! Moo, moo!—a coo! A moment yet! The sun is set, and all the lanes are red; And here is Crummie coming to the milking shed! Why, mother, mother, don't you hear this terrible to-do? Dépêchez-vous! A coo—a coo—a kingdom for a coo! Moo, moo!—a coo! XI When she laughs and waves about Her pink small fingers, who can doubt She's catching at the glittering plumes Of angels flying round the rooms? XII Poor Babbles is dead with sleep; Poor Babbles is dead with sleep! Eyes she hardly can open keep; Lower the gas to a glimmering peep. All good angels, hover and keep Watch above her—poor Babbles!—asleep.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HER BOOK THE INQUISITION I woke at dead of night; The room was still as death; All in the dark I saw a sight Which made me catch my breath. Although she slumbered near The silence hung so deep I leaned above her crib to hear If it were death or sleep. As low—all quick—I leant, Two large eyes thrust me back; Dark eyes—too wise—which gazed intent; Blue eyes transformed to black. Heavens! how those steadfast eyes Their eerie vigil kept! Was this some angel in disguise Who searched us while we slept; Who winnow'd every sin, Who tracked each slip and fall, One of God's spies—not Babbykin, Not Babbykin at all? Day came with golden air; She caught the beams and smiled, No masked inquisitor was there, Only a babbling child! THE FIRST MIRACLE The huge weeds bent to let her pass, And sometimes she crept under; She plunged through gulfs of flowery grass; She filled both hands with plunder. The buttercups grew tall as she, Taller the big dog-daisies; And so she lost herself, you see, Deep in the jungle mazes. A wasp twang'd by; a hornèd snail Leered from a great-leafed docken; She shut her eyes, she raised a wail Deplorable, heart-broken. “Mamma!” Two arms, flashed out of space Miraculously, caught her; Fond mouth was pressed to tearful face— “What is it, little daughter?” BY THE FIRESIDE I Red-bosomed Robin, in the hard white weather She marks thee light upon the ice to rest; She sees the wintry glass glow with thy breast And let thee warm thy feet at thine own feather. II In the April sun at baby-house she plays. Her rooms are traced with stones and bits of bricks; For warmth she lays a hearth with little sticks, And one bright crocus makes a merry blaze! THE RAIDER Her happy, wondering eyes had ne'er Till now ranged summer meadows o'er: She would keep stopping everywhere To fill with flowers her pinafore. But when she saw how, green and wide, Field followed field, and each was gay With endless flowers, she laughed—then sighed, “No use!” and threw her spoils away. BABSIE-BIRD In the orchard blithely waking, Through the blossom, loud and clear, Pipes the goldfinch, “Day is breaking; Waken, Babsie; May is here! Bloom is laughing; lambs are leaping; Every new green leaflet sings; Five chipp'd eggs will soon be cheeping; God be praised for song and wings!” Warm and ruddy as an ember, Lilting sweet from bush to stone, On the moor in chill November Flits the stone-chat all alone: “Snow will soon drift up the heather; Days are short, nights cold and long; Meanwhile in this glinting weather God be thanked for wings and song!” Round from Maytime to November Babsie lilts upon the wing, Far too happy to remember Thanks or praise for anything; Save at bedtime, laughing sinner, When she gaily lisps along, For the wings and song within her— “Thank you, God, for wings and song!” THE ORCHARD OF STARS Amid the orchard grass she'd stood and watch'd with childish glee The big bright burning apples shower'd like star-falls from the tree; So when the autumn meteors fell she cried, with outspread gown, “Oh my, papa, look! Isn't God just shaking apples down?” THE SWEET PEA Oh, what has been born in the night To bask in this blithe summer morn? She peers, in a dream of delight, For something new-made or new-born. Not spider-webs under the tree, Not swifts in their cradle of mud But—“Look, father, Sweet Mrs. Pea Has two little babies in bud!” BROOK-SIDE LOGIC As the brook caught the blossoms she cast, Such a wonder gazed out from her face! Why, the water was all running past, Yet the brook never budged from its place. Oh, the magic of what was so clear! I explained. And enlightened her? Nay— “Why but, father, I couldn't stay here If I always was running away!” BUBBLE-BLOWING Our plot is small, but sunny limes Shut out all cares and troubles; And there my little girl at times And I sit blowing bubbles. The screaming swifts race to and fro, Bees cross the ivied paling, Draughts lift and set the globes we blow In freakish currents sailing. They glide, they dart, they soar, they break. Oh, joyous little daughter, What lovely coloured worlds we make, What crystal flowers of water! One, green and rosy, slowly drops; One soars and shines a minute, And carries to the lime-tree tops Our home, reflected in it. The gable, with cream rose in bloom, She sees from roof to basement; “Oh, father, there's your little room!” She cries in glad amazement. To her enchanted with the gleam, The glamour and the glory, The bubble home's a home of dream, And I must tell its story; Tell what we did, and how we played, Withdrawn from care and trouble— A father and his merry maid, Whose house was in a bubble! NEW VERSION OF AN OLD GAME The storm had left the rain-butt brimming; A dahlia leaned across the brink; Its mirrored self, beneath it swimming, Lit the dark water, gold and pink. Oh, rain, far fallen from heights of azure— Pure rain, from heavens so cold and lone— Dost thou not feel, and thrill with pleasure To feel a flower's heart in thine own? Enjoy thy beauty, and bestow it, Fair dahlia, fenced from harm, mishap! “See, Babs, this flower—and this below it.” She looked, and screamed in rapture—“Snap!” THE GOLDEN SWING-BOAT Across the low dim fields we caught Faint music from a distant band— So sweet i' the dusk one might have thought It floated up from elfin-land. Then, o'er the tree-tops' hazy blue We saw the new moon, low i' the air: “Look, Dad,” she cried, “a shuggy-shue! Why this must be a fairies' fair!” ANOTHER NEWTON'S APPLE We tried to show with lamp and ball How simply day and night were “made”; How earth revolved, and how through all One half was sunshine, one was shade. One side, tho' turned and turned again, Was always bright. She mused and frowned, Then flashed—“It's just an apple, then, 'at's always rosy half way round!” Oh, boundless tree of ranging blue, Star-fruited through thy heavenly leaves, Be, if thou canst be, good unto This apple-loving babe of Eve's NATURULA NATURANS Beside the water and the crumbs She laid her little birds of clay, For—“When some other sparrow comes Perhaps they'll fly away.” Ah, golden dream, to clothe with wings A heart of springing joy; to know Two lives i' the happy sum of things To her their bliss will owe! Day dawned; they had not taken flight, Tho' playmates called from bush and tree. She sighed: “I hardly thought they might. Well,—God's more clever'n me!” WINGS AND HANDS God's angels, dear, have six great wings Of silver and of gold; Two round their heads, two round their hearts, Two round their feet they fold. The angel of a man I know Has just two hands—so small! But they're more strong than six gold wings To keep him from a fall. FLOWERS INVISIBLE She'd watched the rose-trees, how they grew With green hands full of flowers; Such flowers made their hands sweet, she knew But tenderness made ours. So now, o'er fevered brow and eyes Two small cold palms she closes. “Thanks, darling!” “Oh, mamma,” she cries “Are my hands full of roses?” MAKING PANSIES “Three faces in a hood.” Folk called the pansy so Three hundred years ago. Of course she understood! Then, perching on my knee, She drew her mother's head To her own and mine, and said— “That's mother, you, and me!” And so it comes about We three, for gladness sake, Sometimes a pansy make Before the gas goes out. HEART-EASE Last June—how slight a thing to tell!— One straggling leaf beneath the limes Against the sunset rose and fell, Making a rhythm with coloured rhymes. No other leaf in all the air Seemed waking; and my little maid Watched with me, from the garden-chair, Its rhythmic play of light and shade. Now glassy gold, now greenish grey, It dropped, it lifted. That was all. Strange I should still feel glad to-day To have seen that one leaf lift and fall. “SI J'AVAIS UN ARPENT” Oh, had I but a plot of earth, on plain or vale or hill, With running water babbling through, in torrent, spring, or rill, I'd plant a tree, an olive or an oak or willow-tree, And build a roof of thatch, or tile, or reed, for mine and me. Upon my tree a nest of moss, or down, or wool, should hold A songster—finch or thrush or blackbird with its bill of gold; Beneath my roof a child, with brown or blond or chestnut hair, Should find in hammock, cradle or crib a nest, and slumber there. I ask for but a little plot; to measure my domain, I'd say to Babs, my bairn of bliss, “Go, alderliefest wean, “And stand against the rising sun; your shadow on the grass Shall trace the limits of my world; beyond I shall not pass. “The happiness one can't attain is dream and glamour-shine!” These rhymes are Soulary's; the thoughts are Babs's thoughts and mine.</field>
