      <field name="fulltext">Gayer insects fluttering by Ne'er droop the wing o'er those that die; And lovelier things have mercy shown To every failing but their own; And every woe a tear can claim, Except an erring sister's shame. The Giaour. TO LORD HOLLAND. Taught in the dawning of life's joyous years To love, admire, and reverence thy name, Though of youth's feelings few remain the same; And the dim vista of its hopes and fears Memory hath blotted out, with silent tears:â Still in its brightness, even as then it came, Linked with the half-remembered tales of fame: That word before my darkened soul appears, Bringing back lips that speak and smile no more. Spurn not my offering, then, from that bright shrine Where hope would place it; but for those of yore Permit her name, who trembles o'er each line, In its oblivion to be shadowed o'er By the bright happy gloriousness ofâThine! [Oh, ye for whom this tale of woe is told] I Oh, ye for whom this tale of woe is told, Who tempest-tost on passion's stormy deep, Too weak for virtue, yet in vice not bold, Irresolutely turn away and weep: Deep in your torn and wavering bosoms keep One love, beyond all others;â'tis a love Shall never cost you tears, or bid you sleep Less calmly on your couch, lest it should prove A vain and faithless dream by wandering fancy wove. II It is the love of God! Your idols tread Where death hath raised his ever-pointed dart: âThou shalt not worship them.â So He hath said Whose word is law. The numbered hours depart, And the frail idol of each trembling heart Is snatched in mercy from you, that when riven Are all the gentle ties whose magic art Made earth appear your home, the soul forgiven May gladly wing its free unfettered flight to heaven. III And ye who make the joyful heart to grieve, Ye tempters of the weak and sinful! learn To think upon the future: oh, believe Days come, when in your hearts, now cold and stern, The worm that dieth not, Remorse, shall burn, And ye shall mourn the ruin ye have madeâ Shed the vain tear o'er the unconscious urn, Where, early blighted, 'neath Guilt's venomed shade, Lie young confiding hearts, by cruelty betrayed. IV The small still voice shall whisper you, and haunt Your brightest noon-day hour, your stillest night; And with its deep mysterious power shall daunt Each coward heart amid the halls of light, Making the day seem hateful to your sight. Yes, ye shall writhe beneath th' avenging rod! Oh, vainly would ye chase your soul's affright, Or seek to hide beneath the mountain sod, From the unerring eye of an offended God! V Deem not the tale o'erwrought; ye little think How many, whom ye knew when young and gay, The bitter waters of affliction drink, And vainly weep their wretched lives away. Pause o'er the cloud-hid futureâshun the ray Which, meteor-like, misleads, and dies againâ The mournful darkness of each summer's dayâ The listless sadness of a heart in pain:â Tempters and tempted pause, e'er yet that pause be vain! THE SORROWS OF ROSALIE. A TALE. PART I. I Ye marble-hearted ones, whose sighs and tears Are granted only to a gilded woeâ Whose sick and misdirected pity fears To look on all that penury can show, When guilt and want have made a hell below; In whom the unreal mockeries of the stage Alone can wake a momentary glow; Whom griefs impossible, and mimic rage, Far more than sorrow's truth, and wan disease, engage: II To such I would not speakâbut oh! to you Whose generous hearts can feel another's grief; Who all you can, are willing still to do, Though loathsome be the wretch who asks relief. To those who turnâwhere sorrow claims us chiefâ To the lone hut where cheerless misery Clings wistfully to life, though sad and brief, And hopes, however vain those hopes may beâ To those alone I call, for they can feel for me. III Yet little reck I now for pity's throb: Can it recal the years that are no more? Can it repress the deep convulsive sob That, choking, comes from my heart's inmost core? Can it bid those return whose day is o'er? Can it remove the sad sepulchral stone, Or raise again my ruined cottage door? Those whom your pity might have saved, are gone, And now it is not prized, for I am left alone. IV No friend shall watch my lingering soul departâ Unwept, unhonoured, I must pass away; Then pity forced from each reluctant heart Shall pour upon my tomb its useless ray, Condemn my faults, yet mourn my clouded day; Then, when a late compassion smiles in vain, A hand divine shall bid my sorrows stay; And I shall see the forms I love again, And rest my weary head where all are free from pain. V Oh, woman! in this hour of agony Trample not rudely on the fallen one; I have been weak, been guilty, but I die Spurned at, forgotten, friendless, and alone: All that I had, save hope of heaven, is gone; From that safe port no wand'rer shall be driven; God, before whom I bow, will hear my moan; For there's no sin too great to be forgiven By him who pities allâthe Omnipotent of heaven. VI Home of my childhood! quiet, peaceful home! Where innocence sat smiling on my brow, Why did I leave thee, willingly to roam, Lured by a traitor's vainly-trusted vow? Could they, the fond and happy, see me now, Who knew me when life's early summer smiled, They would not know 'twas I, or marvel how The laughing thing, half woman and half child, Could e'er be changed to form so squalid, wan, and wild. VII I was most happyâwitness it, ye skies, That watched the slumbers of my peaceful night! Till each succeeding morning saw me rise With cheerful song, and heart for ever light; No heavy gemsâno jewel, sparkling bright, Cumbered the tresses nature's self had twined; Nor festive torches glared before my sight; Unknowing and unknown, with peaceful mind, Blest in the lot I knew, none else I wished to find. VIII I had a fatherâa gray-haired old man, Whom Fortune's sad reverses keenly tried; And now his dwindling life's remaining span, Locked up in me the little left of pride, And knew no hope, no joy, no care beside. My father!âdare I say I loved him well? I, who could leave him to a hireling guide? Yet all my thoughts were his, and bitterer fell The pang of leaving him, than all I have to tell. IX Each morn, before the dew was brushed away, When the wide world was hushed in deep repose,â When only flowerets hailed the early day, I gathered many a diamond-spangled rose, And many a simple bud that wildly blows; Then, quick returning to my father's bed, Before his heavy eyelids could unclose, I shook away the tears that Nature shed, And placed them with a kiss beside his slumbering head. X My father!âstill I see thy silvery hairs Uplifted gently by the evening breeze, That placid brow, furrowed with many cares, The Bible resting on thy aged knees, Thine eyes that watched the sunset through the trees, The while I read aloud that holy book, Or brought wild flowers with childish zeal to please, Culled by the mossy bank or running brook, And guess'd thine every wish and feeling from a look. XI And oh! my childhood's home was lovelier far Than all the stranger homes where I have been; It seem'd as if each pale and twinkling star Loved to shine out upon so fair a scene; Never were flowers so sweet, or fields so green, As those that wont that lonely cot to grace. If, as tradition tells, this earth has seen Creatures of heavenly form and angel race, They might have chosen that spot to be their dwelling place. XII In evil hour (for me unfortunate) Did the deceiver come; I will not say That he was all on earth most good and great, Or fairer than the other sons of clay; But he was all to meâa single day Spent without him was as a year of pain; And, when he went, I wept whole hours away, Musing upon that love so light and vain, Or trembling lest I ne'er should see his face again. XIII Oh, Arthur! if thine eye should view these lines, Bid not the tear of vain compassion flow; On thee the sun of pleasure brightly shines, For thee the ruby wines still sparkling glow, Though I am pining here in want and woe. When at thy festive board peals loud and long The jocund laugh, or music stealing slow, Think not on her, who once with simple song, And smiles, repaid thee well for luring her to wrong. XIV Oh! still enjoy the cup, the song, the dance, While yet that life of thoughtlessness may be; And should some happier beauty's fav'ring glance Force thee, despite thyself, to think on me, Cold and ungrateful, know that even she Whom thou hadst injured and then left to die, In death forgave theeâloved theeâpitied thee: For, heartless as thou art, the time is nigh When thou shalt mourn my woes, and echo every sigh! XV Oh! still the charm clings round my broken heart With which his early love its cords had bound; In vain I bid his imaged form depart, For when I pray, with sad and fault'ring sound, His name is on my lips,âand, hov'ring round, He, the young Arthur of my happy days, Stands on some green and flow'ry spot of ground, With sunny smile and bright enraptured gaze, Greeting me kindly still with visionary praise. XVI Oh, Arthur! by each fond endearing nameâ By every melody in youth I sungâ By my lost hopesâby my departed fame, By the sad ling'ring dream to which I clung, By every bitter tear from anguish rung, By all my loveâby all my untold grief, Let not another weep that she has hung Upon thy words, and die without relief; For sorrow makes too long a life, however brief. XVII He cameâadmired the pure and peaceful scene, And offer'd money for our humble cot. Oh! justly burned my father's cheek, I ween, âHis sires by honest toil the dwelling got; Their home was not for sale.â It matters not How, after that, Lord Arthur won my love. He smiled contemptuous on my humble lot, Yet left no means untried my heart to move, And call'd to witness his the glorious heavens above. XVIII Oh! dimmed are now the eyes he used to praise, Sad is the laughing brow where hope was beaming, The cheek that blushed at his impassioned gaze Wan as the waters where the moon is gleaming; For many a tear of sorrow hath been streaming Down the changed face, which knew no care before; And my sad heart, awakened from its dreaming, Recals those days of joy, untimely o'er, And mourns remembered bliss, which can return no more. XIX Lord Arthur came, when ev'ning beams had set, That then my aged father might not know How often and how tenderly we met. My heart was doubly weigh'd by guilt and woe, And sometimes, or perchance I fancied so, Methought he gazed on me reproachfully. Oh! more than once I thought I would not go; For piteous and remorseful 'twas to see How bright the old man's smile whene'er he look'd on me. XX But yet I wentâmy weak and wicked heart Could not resolve to bid a last adieu; I could not say I would with Arthur part; I felt I could not live but in his view, And deem'd his love as fervent and as true. I wentâto shield the future from my sight, A veil around my reason close I drew; O'er my dark path there hung no friendly light, But yet I knew each step led farther from the right. XXI It was upon a gentle summer's eve, When Nature lay all silently at restâ When none but I could find a cause to grieve, I sought in vain to soothe my troubled breast, And wander'd forth alone, for well I guess'd That Arthur would be lingering in the bower Which oft with summer garlands I had drest; Where blamelessly I spent full many an hour E'er yet I felt or love's or sin's remorseless power. XXII No joyful step to welcome me was there; For slumber had her transient blessing sent To him I lovedâthe still and balmy air, The blue and quiet sky, repose had lent, Deep as their ownâabove that form I bent, The rich and clustering curls I gently raised, And, trembling, kissed his browâI turned and wentâ Softly I stole away, nor, lingering, gazed; Fearful and wondering still, at my own deed amazed. XXIII My step had roused him, for he lightly sprung From the green couch that Nature's hand had made. Aside the drooping woodbine wreaths he flung:â âAnd art thou, then, of Arthur, love, afraid? Am I less dear to thee in slumber laid? Or dost thou think I should have watched for thee, Unwearied, till thy footsteps in the shade Echoed the sound my heart keeps faithfully, Sleeping or waking, still my dream of hope to be?â XXIV That night, to me a night of misery, In silence thought upon, in silence wept,â I gazed, through tears, on the unconscious sky, While peacefully my poor old father slept.â That night I vowed (and well my vow I kept) That Arthur should be more than all to me. High swelled my heart, and in my bosom leap'd As I looked round, and thought no more to see My village, home, or sireâbut Arthur's bride to be. XXV 'Twas not ambitionânoâfor though he said That I should mistress be of hill and dell, And many a glorious jewel deck my head: No, 'twas not these,âit was enough to dwell Poor, unadorned, so he had loved me well, E'en where I was, or in some humbler spot, Remote and far, where I might truly tell How well I loved (because 'twas his) my cot, And how I would not change with queens my happy lot. XXVI The morning broke, and I was left alone, Bewildered, sorrowful, as in a dream; The small birds sangâthe heavens serenely shone, But oh! to me did nothing joyful seem, And tears unknownâmost bitter tears, would stream For love's rash vow irrevocably made; And when my father spokeâsincere, I deem, Was the sad wish my heart's faint whisper said, On a far colder couch to lay my unconscious head. XXVII The evening cameâwould it had never come! And I prepared to go, with many a tear; A sad, yet willing exile from my home, Forsaking all I held on earth most dear. My father called me, for he loved to hear The Bible read by his loved child alone:â I tried to read; but, oh! I could not bear The fond dim lookâthe gentle, trembling tone; I scarcely heard his words, and sorrow choked my own. XXVIII Murmuring I still read onâmy words unheeded, With fear, and doubt, and sorrow almost wild; From him I could not ask the help I needed, Till breaking on my trance, in accents mild And fatherly, he said, âWhat ails my child? What sorrow, Rosalie, is in thy breast? Perchance thy favourite lamb has been beguiled To quit its homeâperchance some ringdove's nest A truant boy hath torn from out its place of rest. XXIX âNay, sob not thus, my Rosalie; whate'er Thy griefs, thou surely, love, canst tell them me.â I could not answerâchoking with despair, I hid my throbbing brow upon his knee; Then looked up to his face in agony. I had confessed, had one word more been said. But whispering, âthis is childish,â smilingly, He laid his trembling hand upon my head, âHeaven bless thee now, my child! sweet sleep await thy bed!â XXX He went; and when I thought upon the morning, When he would wake to solitary woe, And when I gazed upon the flowers adorning The spot I once deemed happiest belowâ When I beheld the Bible cherished so, For sake of those who now were fallen asleep, I thought within my heart I could not go; And with repentance, silent, sad, and deep, I sat me down alone in bitterness to weep. XXXI My face was buried in my hands: a voice Awoke me from my cheerless dream of grief; Those tones were wont to make my heart rejoice, But nowâI turnedâsalt tears had brought relief, I spoke in hurried accents, faint and brief:â âOh, not to-morrow! then I cannot go.â He heard, as though he gave my words belief, And, turning from me, said, in tones of woe, âFarewell to thee and life, if thou canst wound me so!â XXXII âOh, Arthur! stayââhe turned, and all was o'erâ My sorrow, my repentanceâall was vainâ I dreamt the dream of life and love once more, To wake to sad reality of pain. He spoke, but to my ear no sound was plain, Until the little wicket-gate we passedâ That sound of home I never heard again, And then âdrive onâdrive fasterâyet more fast.â I raised my weeping headâOh! I had looked my last. END OF THE FIRST PART. PART II. I It was in springâthat time of extacy, When but to breathe the fresh and gladsome air, To gaze upon the blue and sunny sky, The bright green fields, the trees, the meadows fair, And cull the wanton wild flowers springing there, To happy youth is worth full many a joy, Which the cold world vainly deems worthy care. Thenâthen to live, is hope without alloy, The sense of being, blissâwhich nought on earth can cloy. II And I had deemed there was no bliss beyond That feeling, till we wandered side by sideâ Till shone on me those eyes so brightly fond, Now my sole sunbeam in the world so wide; Till we together watched the waters glide, In silvery ripples, by the silent shore; Till I had triedâalas! how vainly tried To think on aught as I had thought before. To cease to think of him, must be to think no more. III And he had bought for me a little cot, Where creeping jasmine and light woodbine twined; Oh! beautiful and bright that fairy spot! Yet all its loveliness but brought to mind The one, more beautiful, I left behind; But still I loved it, for beneath each tree Arthur's dear form upon those banks reclined. Whatever faults a stranger's eye might see, That tiny spot of earth was Paradise to me. IV Day after day, and hour succeeding hour, For me Time's flight outstripp'd the flagging wind; And never Love had fetter'd with his power A heart more fondly true, more wholly blind, To all that might to others seem unkind, Than mine;âalthough his absence seemed an age, Fondly I made excuses in my mind. Think me not tediousâscorn me not, ye sage, But weep that all my bliss is centred in a page! V Oh thou, though faithless, still to dearly loved, When I remember that short year of blissâ That sunny dream of love, as yet unmovedâ The transient tear chased by thy tender kiss, I marvel how I can be sunk to this. I see thee still in dreams, and deem, in sooth, I hear thy voice, and watch no word to miss; I see those eyes all tenderness and truthâ Alas! I wake in vain to mourn my blighted youth. VI It was not like the happiness I knew When in my first sweet home of peaceful restâ 'Twas joy, or agonyâeach feeling grew Wild, stormy, and tumultuous in my breast, Though every wish was granted soon as guessed; Though I had all for which the happiest sigh, There was one thoughtâdeep, silent, unexpressed, Which called the unbidden tear-drop to mine eye,â A thought of him I leftâa thought of days gone by! VII Oft would the bitter tear unconscious roll; And Arthur watched, and sought to chase away All that could shade the sunlight of my soulâ Soothed, praised, caressed, and bade my grief not stay, Cheeringly speaking of some distant day When I should turn me to my childhood's home As Arthur's brideâthe gayest 'mid the gay, And bid my fond and aged father come To princely halls and bowers, no more from me to roam. VIII Yet when, with timid, trembling voice, I prayed That holy ties our hearts might soon unite, He turned, half playful, half displeased, and saidâ âThe links of love will best true love requite; Cold are those worldly ties, and no delight Can those unhappy find who love perforce, Who drag the unwilling chain because 'tis right, Struggling for duty, shrinking from remorse, Sighing for earlier times when free their joyous course. IX âOh no, my love!âmy lifeâunchanged, unchanging, Still let the flow'ry chain so lightly bind, That hearts may fancy they are free for ranging, And wander out the charmed links to find; Yet still return to one most true, most kind, Half loth to stay, yet powerless to rove, To all but pleasure and each other blind. Oh 'tis a glorious life, a life of love! So may we live on earth as angels live above. X âContent thee, then, my love! for none shall be So dear to me as thou! and look not grieved, For I have given my life, my soul to thee, My future bride!ââHe spoke, and I believed; Oh! who had listened and not been deceived! Alas! I knew not all the bitter woe, The scorn that waits on her of fame bereaved; I had but menials round me proud to show Respect for Arthur's sake, though I was sunk so low. XI Once, only once, the 'witching power to charm Fled from those lips whose accents were so dear. It was a summer evening, soft and warm; I gazed upon the heaven, blue and clear, From out my little latticed window; near Was Arthur standingâand the woodbine, climbing, Shed a wild fragrance roundâwhen on my ear Fell a sweet sound of distant church-bells chiming, And onward came young forms, their steps to music timing. XII Alas! that dayâI oped the casement wide, And watched that gay group with a smiling faceâ It was a village wedding; and the bride, Rosy and rich in all youth's blooming grace, Came lightly on, past this my fairy place; Nearer and nearer still I saw them glideâ She turned, half startled, as she heard me rise, When some grave matron, walking by her side, Whispered herâslowly she withdrew her eyes, With a sad farewell glance of pity and surprise! XIII Silent she passed, last of the white-robed trainâ Oh! there was something in her pitying look, Mingled with dread, that thrilled my heart with pain. My proud and sinful spirit could not brook To see those gay ones, as their way they took, With half-suppressed contempt in every eye: Tear after tear in vain away I shook, As all, with downcast glance, went slowly by, As if they felt, not saw, some evil thing was nigh. XIV Burst the convulsive sob from out my breast! On Arthur's arm I leant my throbbing brow. âAnd did I then forsake my home of rest To be so scorned, so shunned, so hated now? Oh! take me back where my own flowers still blow, Where the beloved ones I left are dwelling; Let me but see them once before I go To that far land where none my sins are telling. For strong against my breast this breaking heart is swelling!â XV âNay, calm thee, love!ââin vain the words were spoken; Sob after sob rose thick and chokinglyâ My dream was pastâHope's fairy glass was broken, Dreary and dark my prospects seem'd to be; The path of life, where once I thought to see Bright skies above, and flowers of joy beneath, Faded before me in my agony. 'Twas all a wilderness, a desolate heathâ âOh! Arthur, wed me now, or this will be my death.â XVI He dashed away the tear that would encroach, And firmly said, in accents low and deep, âI could from others bear this wild reproach, But not from theeâRosa! to see thee weep Costs me far more than it would thee to keep Thy sorrow within bounds: cease this vain strife, And let my promise bid thy sorrows sleep. Soon as a son is born, to glad my life, Oh, then shall Heaven and man behold thee Arthur's wife! XVII âPass some short months, and theâ:â he turnedâa sigh Burst from his breast, and I could say no more; But fancied, from that hour of agony, That Arthur came less often than before: And when he came!âye that are weeping o'er The lost affections of a heart whose care Was once to please you only!âye that pour Tears silently, then strive your woes to bear, And try the sunniest smile your faded cheek can wear! XVIII Pity me! for it cameâthe hour of sorrow To me, that had forgotten how to weep; To me, who gladly hailed each joyous morrow That woke me from light dreams and peaceful sleep! Oh, ne'er did happiness its vigil keep Over the sinfulâtheirs is transient joy; The trembling blissâthe feelings wild and deep, Shooting like lightning o'er the heartâtheir toy, Coming in brightness still, more darkly to destroy. XIX And Arthur was not what he was ere while, Sad was his eye, and gloomy grew his brow; Changed were his accentsâsorrowful his smileâ Yes,âhe was altered,âoh! I cared not howâ But gazed, and wept in bitterness; and now With eyes averted, or impatient tread, He saw his hapless Rosa's tear-drops flow; No word of comfort soothingly he said, But buried in his hands, with muttered oaths, his head. XX Oh! it was awful, starting from his trance, To see him pace with hurried step the room; Darting bright troubled fires from every glance. Then calm, but pale, without youth's brightening bloom, As storms, subsiding, leave a cheerless gloom. In vain I supplicated him to tell His grief to me, and let me share his doom, Assured that death with him were welcomed wellâ No word he spoke, but still on me those dark eyes fell. XXI Months passed: one evening, as of early days, When first my bosom thrilled his voice to hear, And thought upon the gentle words of praise Which forced my lips to smile, and chased my fear; I sangâa sob, deep, single, struck my ear; Wondering, I gazed on Arthur, bending lowâ His features were concealed, but many a tear, Quick gushing forth, continued fast to flow, Stood where they fell, then sank like dew-drops on the snow. XXII Oh yes! however cold in after years, At least it cost thee sorrow them to leave me; And for those few sincere, remorseful tears, I do forgive (though thou couldst thus deceive me) The years of peace of which thou didst bereave me. Yesâas I saw those gushing life-drops come Back to the heart which yet delayed to grieve me, Thy love returned a moment to its home, Far, far away from me for ever then to roam. XXIII I gazed a moment, mute with sad surprise; My bosom thrilled by that deep sound of woe;â âOh Arthur, oh beloved! raise those dear eyes, Let but my tears with thine together flow! Whate'er thy grief, let, love, let Rosa know.â Startled, he turnedâsad as a funeral chime, The slow words cameââOh! Rosa, I must go: This night I sail to reach a foreign clime; Nay, look not thus appalledâit is but for a time.â XXIV Vain were his wordsâchill sank my fainting heart: âOh! if dark fate hath doomed us now to sever, I do conjure thee, though all hope depart, By our past love, by every vain endeavour To hold thee here,âsay, dost thou go for ever?â âNo; by my hopes of blissâby all that's dearâ By the blue midnight skyâthe silent riverâ By Heaven, which only now my vow can hear, Within three transient months expect me to appear.â XXV He wentâhe went! his shadow, as he passed, Traced his dark outline in the silvery light; And, as he closed the gate, he gave one last Long lingering look of love, as if the sight Recalled to memory many a fairer night; He raised his eyes to heaven's blue vault serene, And turned away;âhe wentâthe moonbeams bright Chequered with wavy lines the peaceful sceneâ And long with dreamy thought I watched where he had been. XXVI Still hope was left me, and each tedious hour Was counted, as it brought his coming near; And joyfully I watched each fading flower; Each tree, whose shadowy boughs grew red and sear; And hailed sad Autumn, favourite of the year. At length my time of sorrow cameâ'twas over, A beauteous boy was brought me, doubly dear, For all the fears that promise caused to hover Round himâ'twas pastâI claimed a husband in my lover. XXVII Oh, beauteous were my baby's dark blue eyes, Evermore turning to his mother's face, So dove-like soft, yet bright as summer skies; And pure his cheek as roses, ere the trace Of earthly blight or stain their tints disgrace. O'er my loved child enraptured still I hung; No joy in life could those sweet hours replace, When by his cradle low I watched, and sung; While still in memory's ear, his father's promise rung. XXVIII Three monthsâthree lingering months, had past away, And my sweet infant had begun to know Upon whose neck his clasping fingers lay, And sought by little signs, his love to show; And when my tears unconsciously would flow, Raised those young innocent eyes, with questioning glance. Hark! a quick step is tramping through the snowâ 'Tis he, 'tis he! I cried, from distant France! But my heart echoed low, 'tis he, 'tis he,âperchance. XXIX Close to my beating heart I strained my boy, That moment's bliss repaid whole months of care. Forward I sprang, in fulness of my joy; In joy!âalas, it was not Arthur there. Stern was the aspect, haughty was the air Of him, who gazed around in wondering mood. âLady,â he said at length, âart thou aware From whom I come?â Trembling, a while I stood; Then wildly cried, âfrom him! oh, are thy tidings good?â XXX âLord Arthur greets thee, and he bade me say, That he no more thine image may retain; That thou must cast the lingering hope away, If hope thou hast of seeing him again; A second parting would but give thee pain; And nevermoreââthe rest I could not hear: There were words spoken, but I strove in vain To catch the sense; stricken with doubt and fear, Sick grew my fainting heart, and dull my senseless ear. XXXI Something, I know, was said in soothing tone, As if some comfort in the words were told; Something in praise of that dear little one, And offers large of goldâaccursed goldâ Oh! at that sound how every vein grew cold! Would that bring back the hope that fled for ever? All rushed upon my mindâthe days of oldâ The promise made when we were doomed to sever; I asked, and weeping memory answered, never! never! XXXII I strove for speechâI lifted up my child; With quivering lip that breathed imperfect sound, âTell him,â I said, with voice and gesture wild, âIf in his heart some vain excuse be found, Tell him, this tie, and Heaven, will hold him bound; Tell him, the heart he laboured to beguile Will, breaking, firmly clasp his image round; Tell him, my life will linger but a while, Say that you saw his child, my rosy infant, smile. XXXIII âTake back your gold!âin the heart's agony It is not valuedâit is nothing worth; Tell him, if he is changed, I soon shall die, And then can only need a little earth. Bid him think once, amid his hours of mirth, On the young gladness of our mutual loveâ Bid him remember, at my infant's birth, The promise only heard by Heaven above;â Oh! once he had a heartâseek thou that heart to move.â XXXIV He promised, and he wentâoh, dire suspense! To breaking hearts how terrible art thou! When every sound strikes sickening on the sense, And the cold drops stand on the pallid brow. I watchedâI waitedâyea, I hoped e'en nowâ I thought, perchance, that Arthur's self would come To bid adieu!âI recked not, asked not how, But thought, if he revisited his home, And only saw his child, again he could not roam. XXXV The third day brokeâa menial servant came, And brought a letterâwell I knew the hand; Unkind to writeâto sendâmy trembling frame Could scarce the strength of tottering steps command. With dim, but eager eyes, each line I scannedâ Oh! what the words?âthe wordsâaway! each one Had lived for ever, even though writ in sand; He said, he gave me back the heart he won,â He saidâhear it, bright Heaven! Albert was not his son! XXXVI I read itâyes! I read itâand my heart Refused to break! I read it yet again, Gazed on, and bade my spell-bound soul departâ Looked up in anguish to the heavensâ'twas vain! I shrieked, I wept, sole witness of my pain! Speak for me now, though sinful, lost, and wild, By the vain passion I might not restrainâ By all my sufferingsâby thy mercy mildâ Oh! witness, by all these, he did reject his child! XXXVII It was his child! ungrateful and unkind, Thou could'st not think what yet thou dar'dst to say. Oh! if remorse hath ever crossed thy mind, May heaven forgive when I am far away! Mayest thou ne'er think, amidst the proud and gay, Of her who now so freely hath forgivenâ Of her who loved thee in life's earliest day, Who lives to pray for thee, to love thee evenâ Her latest hope, to meet thy pardoned soul in heaven. XXXVIII I roseâI took my childâthe fatherless! Wiped the big tear-drops from my heavy eyes, That gushed at every mute and dear caress My infant gave; and, as the lone dove flies Far from her widowed nest, through stranger skies, To seek her mate, so, reckless of the scorn Which on the world's sad victim heavy lies, I went, with racking doubt and anguish torn, To die, or bid young Hope again with Love be born. XXXIX With weary limbs, parched lips, and fainting heart, I reached the proud metropolisâaround Were busy throngs, of which I formed no part; And cheerful faces, and the jocund sound Of countless human voices; friends, who found Those that they sought for; children, that could come To meet their mother with a joyous bound. Who welcomed me? who bade me cease to roam? Alas! to me this scene was but my Arthur's home! XL I pressed my baby to my throbbing breast, In the wide world he was my only tie; Others had parents, husbands, homes of rest, Loved and were loved againâOh! what had I? No voice was there to soothe mine agony, I wandered on 'mid crowds, alone, alone; None bade me stay, none bade me cease to sigh; By all unpitied, and to all unknown, I had my loveâmy griefâmy child:âall else was gone. XLI I reached his doorâthat door which once I thought Had oped to welcome me as Arthur's bride; Where oft in joyous fancy, I had brought My poor old father, evermore beside His couch to watch, and be his only guide! Where were those buoyant hopes and feelings now? Where was that vision, raised by youthful pride? Fled with the pureness of that virgin brow Which sorrow might have dimmed, but sin alone could bow. XLII I knockedâoh! louder knocked my beating heart! When to the door a heavy footstep came; The menial smiled, and bade me quick depart, Muttering, âhard travelling for so fair a dame,â While indignation shook my trembling frame; I shrank away, the ready tears gushed forth, But pride forbadeâI could not speak my name; A moment's silence, and upon the earth That pitying servant threw some coins of little worth. XLIII Yea, pity touched his heartâbut oh! for meâ Was this my fate?âI was condemned to take From Arthur's servant common charity? I roseâI said, âalas! for pity's sake Let me see himâthy masterâlet me make Myself appeal unto his hardened soul! Some throb of dying mercy I might wakeâ Some feeling interest cannot controulâ Some wish, the bitter grief he caused me, to console!â XLIV Hard, hard to be refused! he bade me wait, The only favour he could now bestowâ To stand a mendicant at Arthur's gate, Watching the time when he and all should go To seek amusement in the sunny glow. Oh! once the gladsome light had charms for me! Once I could watch the dark blue river flow, With smiles of joy, with thoughts of extacy; But lips must cease to smile when hearts no more are free. XLV I waitedâHeavens! how crept the weary hours, Step after step, away!âThey bring not him! At length I caught his voice.âAll-gracious Powers! How throbbed my heart, how failed each quivering limb! How seemed each object in my sight to swim! That light, gay, laughing voice!âit ceasedâthe soundâ He came, he came, I raised mine eyes, though dim, And indistinct all figures seemed around: I saw him wellâmy hopes my fears, an answer found. XLVI Beautiful as in life's first early day; Proud as the eagle on his airy height; With that bright sparkling eye, whose glancing ray Spoke from beneath his brow, like dawning lightâ With stately form, to fix the wandering sight, And those dark curls uncovered to the wind Which oft, in happier days of sunshine bright, With garlands wild my sportive fingers twined; He stood, lingering awhile for those who came behind. XLVII Onward they cameâthe young, the gay, the freeâ With eyes reflecting back the beams that shone, With careless step, and youthful revelry, And graceful laughter's light and silvery tone. They pauseâa gay adieu, and they are gone To meet again at festival or dance; And one fair creature now was left alone, On whom my Arthur cast an anxious glance, And she replied with smilesâa sister's smiles, perchance. XLVIII I could not riseâI vainly strove to speak, The words, imperfect, died upon my tongue; Like some sad dream we struggling try to break, The scene around upon my spirit hung; And ever in my ear the accents rung, âIf hope thou hastââoh! could I hope again? With tender care a mantle Arthur flung Across that lady's steed, and smoothed his mane, Then turned to mount his own, and seized the tightened rein. XLIX Despair gives strength.âWith one convulsive bound I reached him, clung to him with fevered grasp; And when he gazed in wild amazement round, And strove to disengage my frantic clasp, I burst the bonds of silence with a gasp, And Arthur answered. Oh! upon my ear, Like the the cold poison of the deadly asp, Freezing my life-blood, fell those accents drearâ Yet he had loved me wellâwhat had I now to fear? L Hurried and passionate the words he spokeâ Pale grew his cheek, and darker fell his brow; And from his breast a groan of anguish broke: âRosa I would that thou hadst spared me now, 'Tis vainâ'tis pastâalas! thou know'st not how I struggled and entreatedâ'twas in vain; I may not now renew my broken vow,â I may not even visit thee again; Rosa, forgive meâI have suffered equal pain.â LI Wild was my laughââOh! heartless and unkind! Thou suffer! may'st thou never feel like me! Yea, give thy vows of passion to the wind; Heaven heard them, though to man, unknown they be; Heaven sees me shunned by all, betrayed by thee; Lured from the happy home where once I smiled; Heaven hears my moan of hopeless agonyâ Heaven hears thee scorn thy young and innocent childâ Heaven sees us stand e'en now, beguiler and beguiled.â LII âRosa! 'tis vainâwhate'er I can, I willâ Ask what thou wilt, which riches may bestow; The cot is thineâmayest thou be happy still! In vain regret may rise, or tears may flowâ Angels may smile aboveâman weeps below; The happiest hours of all my life are pastâ The faded flower of love no more can blowâ Thou see'st my brideâmy die for life is castâ Writeâask whate'er thou wiltâthis meeting is our last.â LIII With desperate step and strong he broke away, Upon his courser in an instant sprung; When soft I heard her voice in pity sayâ âHast thou relieved her, Arthur?â Still I clung To himâto lifeâtill at my feet was flung A purseâa heavy purseâI loosed my hold. Loud on the sounding stones the iron rung Of those departing steedsâmy blood ran coldâ I gazed on what remainedâmy child, my grief, and gold. LIV I did not faintâI did not tear my hairâ I did not shriek to Heaven and man for aid; Once only, when some gazer's piteous care Raised up the purse, and gentle offer made, A groan of anguish, which might not be staid, Burst forth; all then was mute as my despair. I lifted up my child, who, half afraid, Clung trembling to my heart in silence there, And turned me to departâreturning homeâah! where? LV My cot! oh! was it mine? was I to be A guilty thing, dependent, though unloved? Yet whither turn, to shun the charity Of him whose heart so cold and stern had proved? Would strangers pity when he was not moved? Or would the humble friends of happier days Welcome the wanderer, who lonely roved Through the dark world, shunning her fellows' gaze, Unheard, unsought, the voice of pity or of praise? LVI Yet there was oneâone on the boundless earth, Who would not spurn me, even when fallen and lost; Whose gentle fondness smiled upon my birthâ Who watched if e'er a shade of sadness crossed My laughing browâand when, by passion tossed, My heart rebellious rose, had gently cheered And watched, consoled, supported, loved me most In sorrow sought, by Nature's ties endearedâ Father! to thee I turn, thy wrath no longer feared. LVII Once I bethought me, vain and hopeless thought! To make appeal to her, that pitying oneâ Woman to woman. Then I would have sought To move her gentle heart with anguished moan; But ever on my ear there fell the tone Of Arthur's hurried wordsââThou see'st my bride!â Was she indeed his bride? Yes, hope was goneâ I felt it true. Roll on, life's 'whelming tide, Wreck the frail bark which now hath lost its only guide. LVIII And this was he who loved me; he who came To whisper vows to my too willing ear With lip of melody and heart of flame; Vows whose glad truth I deemed so trebly dear To him who breathed them, that had doubt or fear Been raised within my heart, they could not growâ He whose bright eyes bespoke a soul sincereâ This, this was he whoâvain remembrance now! He lives to scorn the pastâhe lives to break his vow. LIX Ah no! I could not turn me to that cot Which in life's gladsome spring I loved so well; I could not think upon my hopeless lot, And then return, forgotten, there to dwell Where onceâoh memory! no longer tell The tale too oft repeated, and in vain. What reck we of the scenes that once befel, If all the future is composed of pain? Farewell, thou stranger home! welcome my own again! END OF THE SECOND PART. PART III. I I journeyed onâthe weary sun had set, And darkness shadowed o'er the face of heaven; Sleep, that can bid the wretched to forget, To my sweet babe its late repose had given; When changed the aspect of that gentle even, The bitter blast came sweeping o'er my path; Far off, in eddying rounds, the snow was drivenâ Burst o'er my head the thunder's dreadful wrathâ I turned to God, my stay, the hope the wanderer hath. II âShield, shield my child, All-merciful, All-just! Grant but the shelter of the meanest shed! If that mine hour is come, if die I must, Spare me at least to house his gentle head! Have mercy, oh! have mercy!âCold the bed His form must press, if I should perish now. Yet, yet a little while, and with the dead, Smiling and thankful, I would lay me low. Hear me, by all my woesâbefore thy throne I bow.â III Oh, night of horror and of agony! When chilling fear came like some fell disease; When the blue lightning shot along the sky, Flashing bright ruin round, its prey to seize; When the cold wind howled through the rocking trees, And shivering, wet, and weary, I pursued, Struggling against the strong opposing breeze, Trembling with anguish, faint for lack of food, Across the wintry waste, a path unknown and rude. IV At length the whirlwind ceased, the morning broke: Oh! never had I seen the sun arise, Ere from my dream of pleasure I awoke, In all the radiance of blue summer skies, With half the bliss with which my weeping eyes Received the gray and melancholy morn, Which, pale and tearful, seemed to bid the ties Which bound me to the world again be bornâ Those ties which but last night I deemed in sunder torn. V I reached a hamlet, and a moment's peace Dwelt in my heart. 'Twas sweet to hear once more The busy sounds I fancied were to cease To animate a heart whose beat was o'er. I gently tapped a lowly cottage door, And asked for food with faint and humble voice; I fed my child, with bliss unknown before, When I had plenty round and viands choice: Oh! those who suffer much are those who most rejoice! VI Again I turned to wend my weary way, Hoping to reach my home ere evening came; And the sun gladdened soon the misty day, Infusing life and vigour in my frame; Half faded from my heart the sense of shame, Arose again the hope that had expired; And thoughts of him who would not harshly blame, Of penitence, of love, my bosom fired, And prayer to Him whom prayer and sorrow never tired. VII I reached my home when the warm sun was setâ When o'er the beauties of that peaceful scene A few faint rosy beams were lingering yet: I thought, while gazing on that lovely e'en, On what I was, on what I once had been; I thought, as round me lay the drifted snow, How bright the summer when I last had seen That cottage sleeping in the sunset glow, Where now are leafless trees, through which the bleak winds blow. VIII Such was the change my heart had undergoneâ There all was gloomy, dark, and desolate, And winter reigned where brightest spring had shone. I stood a moment at the wicket gate, Lingering, and trembling on the verge of fate, With weeping eyes upraised to that calm Heaven, With fear and shame, that urged me yet to wait, While from my heart all confidence was driven; And now I deemed my crime too great to be forgiven. IX On, Rosa, onâa father must forgive! The heart which judges truly cannot love; He waits to welcome thee, to bid thee live For him, no more in misery to rove: Oh, haste thee yet, a father's pity prove: I oped the gate, advancedâretreatedâno, I dare not seek that injured heart to move. What shall I say? yet whither can I go? Oh, help me, Heaven! give strength for more than mortal woe. X I pausedâacross the latticed window came, While cold and hesitating there I stayed, The cheerful blazing of the hearth's bright flameâ That hearth where oft in infancy I played, And many a gambol by my father made, Reckless of stormy winds, which raged without, Save when, with lisping, innocent tongue, I prayed That God would save, in terror, grief, and doubt, Wandering and weary ones, condemned to venture out. XI I was that wanderer now!âI oped the door; I stood upon the threshold of my home; A gasp of agony,âa moment more, And pardoned Rosalie should cease to roam! To that bright room my faltering steps had come; Methought e'en now I felt the cheering glow, Saw the brown bread, the bright ale's sparkling foam, Which once my hand had bade for him to flow To whom but hirelings now their tardy duty show. XII The latch was lifted, and I gazed aroundâ But oh, my heart! there were bright faces there, And cheerful voices, but it ceased, that sound; A youth, and aged man with silver hair, Knelt with clasped hands, to breathe their evening prayer; And a young wife, who rocked her cradled child, Ceased her low murmuring song, that on the air No voice but his might sound, and gently smiled, Till startled by my shriek, which rose long, loud, and wild. XIII Yesâbright and cheerful as 'twas wont to be, The hearth was blazing, but, alas! for whom? Oh what was I to themâor they to me? I gazed around, hoping my steps had come Astray, but no! too well I knew the room; Too true the certainty struck on my heartâ I read in stranger eyes my dreadful doom! Their welcome, only an astonished startâ Their links on earth, fond ties, in which I had no part! XIV âMy father! oh, my father!â vain the cryâ I had no father now; no need to say âThou art alone!â I felt my miseryâ My father, yet return,âreturn! the day When sorrow had availed is past away; Tears cannot raise the dead, grief cannot call Back to the earthly corse the spirit's rayâ Vainly eternal tears of blood might fall; One short year since, he livedâmy hopes now perished all! XV A shriek, and low I sank upon the ground; The last dim sound that fell upon my ear, Those pitying voices murmuring around, The last dim glance showed pity's trembling tear; It ceasedâand fled the power to see or hear. My child was taken from my failing arms, Happy, unconscious now of hope or fear; Dead to the poignant sense of earthly harms, Dried were my bitter tears, and hushed my heart's alarms. XVI On, onâthrough many a dark and mournful day I lived, half conscious, in a dreamy land, While many a vision came, and passed away, And many a fairy scheme of bliss was planned, And ever by me Arthur seemed to stand; With him in sunny fields and bowers I ranged, In scenes where we had wandered hand in hand; And I was happy till the vision changed; 'Twas Arthur still, but oh! with heart and looks estranged! XVII And then, methought, beneath a stormy sky, With his gray hair thin streaming on the wind, My father stood in hopeless agony; Reproached me as ungrateful and unkind; And prayed that I as hard a fate might find; Or on a lowly couch his form was lying, Whispering sad words, which, still with head inclined, I vainly strove to hear; and, he while dying, Cast a reproachful glance at me for not replying. XVIII And then again it changed, and bound I stood While demons tore my baby limb from limb, And still the stream of gushing living blood Came trickling on the earth, all fresh from him Who might have mingled with the cherubim, And been as bright as they: warm o'er my feet, All seen too plain, though vision-like and dim, Those crimson rivulets appeared to meet, While powerless still I stood, unable to retreat. XIX At length I slept; and when I woke again Those fevered dreams had fled, and left me weak, With but the sense confused of grief and pain: I gazed around, and feebly tried to speak; And kindly eyes, that watched my slumber break, Turned to the couch,âI asked them for my child, And that young wife replied, in accents meek: My babe was brought meâI was wan and wild; And, shrinking back, it turned to that kind one, and smiled. XX Long, long I wept with weak and piteous cry O'er my sweet infant, in its rosy bloom, As memory brought my hours of agony Again before my mind;âI mourned his doom; I mourned my own: the sunny little room In which, oppressed by sickness, now I lay, Weeping for sorrows past, and woes to come, Had been my own in childhood's early day. Oh! could those years indeed so soon have passed away! XXI Past, as the waters of the running brook; Fled, as the summer winds that fan the flowers; All that remained, a wordâa toneâa look, Impressed, by chance, in those bright joyous hours: Blossoms which, culled from youth's light fairy bowers, Still float with lingering scent, as loth to fade, In spite of sin's remorseless 'whelming powers, Above the wreck which time and grief have made, Nursed with the dew of tears, though low in ruin laid. XXII And they had watched me all that weary whileâ Those kindly hearts, and made my child their own, And saw with pleasure still its infant smile; And even now, when fell disease was gone, Besought me not to wander forth alone In the bleak stormy world where friends were not; And bade me stay, although my tale was known, Here in the shelter of their lonely cot, Where I might yet attain a not unhappy lot! XXIII But noâI could not stay in that sweet place, So changed, so fallen from all which once I was, And see reflected, in each well-known face, My shame and sorrowânever!âhuman laws Were framed against me, while the unpitying cause Of all my misery, secure from blame, Passed the gay hours in mirth, nor made one pause To think of me in mournfulness and shameâ Heaven might forgive, but man would scorn my blighted name. XXIV And I departed thence, with thanks and tears; The meed I offered they declined to take, But prayed Heaven would prolong my baby's years, That he might wrestle for his mother's sake; And said, if misery came, that I might make Their home again my homeâye tender-hearted! 'Twas yours the fount of tenderer grief to wake! And tears, unfeigned and half unconscious, started, As, slow and mournfully, once more I thence departed. XXV Once more a weary wandererâonce more Without a shelter for the coming eve! Why did I dream my woes would soon be o'er? Why did my heart my reason thus deceive, To think the sinful could forget to grieve? Oh! dream soon broken! hope forgotten now! Last feeling which the human heart can leave, Teach me again to trust the broken vow! Friend of the desolateâin misery help me thou! XXVI I rested in the churchyard, where, alone, The verdant mound raised o'er his buried head, Marked by a rude and solitary stone, My father layâthe long-lamented dead! I knelt, and many a bitter tear I shed. âO thou much injured, yet devoutly loved, Who first in infancy my footsteps led! If pardon may be found for her who roved, And left thee lonelyâoh! may Heaven, mayest thou be moved! XXVII âIf days of agony and nights of tears Can aught atone for passion's wild excess; If mercy e'en the worst of sinners cheers, When sunk in penitence and mournfulness, Oh! then let Mercy hear my moan, and bless, Although unworthy, her who prostrate liesâ Hear me in anguish and in bitterness! If grief can reach thy home, beyond the skies, A late repentance take, since death the rest denies.â XXVIII All that remained, the grave, the silent grave Of him o'er whose unconscious form I pined, In early youth the generous and the brave, In age the tender-hearted and the kind, The past, the happy past! rushed o'er my mind, Tinging with hues, from Memory's painful dart, Those busy scenes with his dear image twined; And then the future struck upon my heartâ That future in which he should never bear a part. XXIX That future cameâsad months had rolled awayâ Tears had been shed, and sighs been heaved in vain; And I, that Rosalie, so young and gay, Was now a withered form of want and pain; My voice, which now but sounded to complain In hollow accents, startled e'en my ear; And my weak limbs could scarce the power retain To drag me forth, in lingering doubt and fear, Imploring food for him who now alone was dear. XXX Oh, Heaven! the hour arrived when I had nought, When sick and sorrowful I gazed around, Knowing, alas! the little store I brought Was all exhaustedâwhere could help be found? Hard hearts had they to whom I now was bound; For the dark wretched room in which I lay They ask'd for paymentâscarce the falt'ring sound Of vain excuse and vainer prayer to stay Had pass'd my lips, when stern they bade me speed away. XXXI âAway, and in the loneliness of night!â To wait fresh pain with ev'ry varying hour; âOh! yet delayâabuse not thus your right! List to the pelting of the dreary shower! Angry and fierce the opposing tempests lower; Oh! yet till daylight!ââvain, alas! the cry! With brow repulsive, and resistless power, She thrust me forth beneath the inclement skyâ Woman to woman did this deed of cruelty. XXXII A miserable night of useless weeping, Shiv'ring beneath the pillar'd portico Of some great house, were all were softly sleeping, Deaf to the storm that beat, the winds that blow, Reckless of those that wander to and fro, Houseless and homeless, near their proud abodes. Unconscious slumberers! little do ye know The nightly weight of misery which o'erloads Near you, unpitied crowds, and to destruction goads! XXXIII The morrowâand the grey and silent streets Swarmed with the varied multitudes anew, Still changing with each fev'rish hour that fleets. The busy many and the anxious few In quick succession pass before my view. And now my infant, pining in my arms, With cheeks like faded roses in the dew, Awoke in me a mother's dread alarmsâ Huger and cold oppress'd and nipp'd his baby charms. XXXIV The day wore on, the gleamy sun was setting, A deep conviction stole upon my mind; All but my cherished innocent babe forgettingâ I roseâI criedââHave mercy, passers kind, Upon my child! let misery pity findâ Oh! hear meââand they pass'd one after one, Some frownedâsome cast a pitying look behind, And some few gaveâat length the day was gone, And then I bowed my head and wearily sank down. XXXV But I had food for him, though I was left Unpitied thus to struggle with my fateâ This ling'ring mournful hope was not bereft, That he would live to feel a generous hate Of all the cold restraints of pomp and state; And then, when proud and beautiful he stood, His father would, repentant, though too late, Sigh o'er past evil and neglected good, With useless tears, oft shed in penitential mood. XXXVI 'Twas not to beâday vanished after day, And fewer gave, and fainter grew my prayerâ In vain I watch'd my baby as he layâ Night cameâhis couch was in the open airâ What could avail a mother's tenderest care! With miser handâthe pittance hoarded still, Dealt out to him alone a frugal fare, But to delay, not banish, future ill, While famine spared the babe whom misery was to kill. XXXVII At last 'twas spentâI asked for alms in vainâ Tired of relieving one who still prayed on, With frowning brow they turn'd from sight of pain, With silent tongue and tearless eyes were gone. I waited till the close of day, but none Had taken pity on me, and I went Once more to him who doom'd me to be low; Mothers are humbleâo'er my child I bent; I rose to ask his alms who scorned the gold he sent. XXXVIII Lonesome and wearily I reached the door, But he was goneâgone with his happy bride, Whereâoh! I asked notâwish'd to hear no more; His heart was far awayâthe world was wide, And I was lonelier than all beside! Another day of sad and anxious weeping; Another day of famineâall denied; Another night my mournful vigils keeping Above my pining child, whom hunger hinder'd sleeping. XXXIX Dreamily had the heavy days gone by, And Albert fadedâfainter grew his criesâ Oh! ye that ever bent in agony Above your pallid infant! ye that rise, And glance, half fearfully, with 'wildered eyes, Expecting deathâthen kneel in tears to pray, With tongue that speech articulate denies, That God will yet awhile the stroke delay, Think what I suffered then, from weary day to day. XL You softly place that little languid head, You tempt him with the comforts spread around, But I could envy now the meanest shedâ My babe was starvingâbless'd if I but found A morsel destined for the hungry hound! Moving his pale sweet lips with grateful smile, Unwitting of the fate that o'er him frowned; His was the presentâgladdened for awhileâ The future mine, of woe no hope might now beguile. XLI There came a dayâI sat aloneâalone! The dismal showers had drench'd my thread-worn dress, And, seated on the cold and dripping stone, Without the power to ask for almsâstill less The strength to wander in my wretchedness, My dying baby laid upon my knee; I look'd on those who pass'd, and sought to guess Where pity dwelt, still gazing wistfully, With hope, but half extinct, for that which could not be. XLII A carriage stopp'dâa lady, richly dress'd, Alighted, and I rose in doubt and fearâ The faint and murm'ring tones, but half express'd, Fell on a hardened heart and deafened ear; She pass'dâI gazedâand felt the blow severe; But as she went, upon the stones there fell A sparkling cross, of jewels rich and rare; Rushed o'er my mind the thoughts that dared not dwellâ I had a childâthat child!âoh! needs there more to tell? XLIII I seized itâfledâbehind me rose a shoutâ On!âon!âmy trembling knees could scarce sustain The weight aboveânear, nearer came the routâ On! on!âoh! shall the effort be in vain? A few yards more, and then would end my painâ I reached a shopâflung down the cross, and said, âFood for my child!â I could no more restrain My weakness and my woeâI snatched the bread, Gave it to him, and sunk lifeless, unconscious, dead! XLIV I wokeâoh! would that I had slept for ever! Stern forms were standing roundâI heard the cry Of that dear little one they sought to sever From his poor mother! one long gasping sigh, One lingering pause of nature's agony, And I recovered: let it not be told What followed nextâsuffice it, that to die Contains no pang so sickening, deep, and cold, As that which rent my heart in those barbarians' hold. XLV An hour, and I was pent in prison wallsâ The shriek of woe, the bursting sob, the tearâ Not that, the soft and sad, which gently falls, But scalding bitterness was shedding hereâ Oh, God! those prisoned hours, so long, so drear! Stillâstill I feel the damp and heavy cell Strike on my numbing sense, palsied with fear; Yet I had him, loved tenderly and well, Dear link of life, to whom I clung, whate'er befel. XLVI Where is my child? great God! forgive these moans! Forgive the questionâwildly, vainly spoke! 'Tis over now, but thenâye sad grey stones, Graves of the lovely and the loved, revoke Your cruel mandate; let the chain be broke, And give me back my ownâmy own! alas! 'Tis mine no moreâthe dead may not be wokeâ Unfading treasures misers may amass, But rosy cheeksâbright eyesâlike airy visions pass. XLVII I watch'dâI pray'dâI knelt all desolate, While fev'rish throbbed my baby's pulseâI tried Not to repine at the decrees of fate; I sought for resignationâyea, I cried, âThy will be done,ââbut noâit was denied. Oft as I gazed upon that flushing cheek, Oft as those eyelids turn'd, submission died; I held his hand, so languid, faint, and weak, And laid my lips on his, with vain attempt to speak. XLVIII Three nightsâthe fourth, sleep closed my weary eyes, While kneeling by his couchâa happier dream Stole o'er my mindâmethought I saw him rise From slumber's arms, with eyes whose sunny beam Outshone his ownâby our own trickling stream I stood, and still my father bless'd my boy, While bright and joyous, as on earth could seem, All shone aroundâ'twas hope without alloyâ A soundâa painful startâand broke my dream of joy. XLIX I bent above my childâthe life was gone! Cold was the hand and pulseless was the heart, And I was lock'd in darkness, and alone! I could not watch the ling'ring ray depart From those half-conscious eyesâDeath's silent dart Had pierced him whom the stormy lightning sparedâ Whom famine failed to slay: a groanâa startâ Were welcomed now with raptureâNature dared All agonies but one; in silence she despaired. L Was it then true? it was. No hideous dream, âMaking night horrible,â obscured my senseâ The soul was fledâhow nothing all things seem When those we toiled for are departed hence: There, with a mournful silent eloquence Rending my heart, lay the untasted crustâ Alas! the day they bore my infant thence, In vain I prayed the mercifulâthe justâ They laid my rosy babe low with the worm i' the dust. LI My trial came, and I could only say I livedâI breathedâI felt nor hope nor fear; My thoughts were in a distant world, away With him who wasâwho once had been so dear! One only sentence struck upon my ear, A question of that wretched dayââMy Lord, She gave it to her child!â was answeredâdrear And dark as was my soul, I felt that wordâ My shriek so long, so wild, was never wilder heard. LII It pass'd, that day, and then they set me freeâ I gazed in melancholy stupor round; The prison walls had been the same to meâ Sorrow remainedâsorrow that knew no bound! They gave me shelterâI nor smiled nor frownedâ My heart was dead within meâsad I sate, With but one thought, my baby's grassy mound; Night cameâI restedâfood was broughtâI ate, Nor ever murmur made for my unhappy fate. LIII Years have gone byâmy thoughts have risen higherâ I sought for refuge at the Almighty's throne; And when I sit by this low mould'ring fire, With but my Bible, feel not quite alone, Lingering in peace, till I can lay me down, Quiet and cold in that last dwelling place, By him o'er whose young head the grass is grownâ By him who yet shall rise with angel face, Pleading for me, the lost and sinful of my race. LIV And if I still heave one reluctant sighâ If earthly sorrows still will cross my heartâ If still to my now dimmed and sunken eye The bitter tear, half checked, in vain will start, I bid the dreams of other days depart, And turn, with clasping hands and lips compress'd, To pray that Heaven will soothe sad memory's smart, Teach me to bear and calm my troubled breast, And grant her peace in Heaven who not on earth may rest. ELVIRA; A FRAGMENT. And she will comeâher sweet lute strung behind, And her dark tresses streaming to the wind; Death on her cheek; and madness in her air Will rave in all the wildness of despair.â Oh! how can our existence be so dear, Embittered by the frequent burning tear? Why were we formed to live, to die in pain, To wish for what, to hope, alas! were vainâ While senseless, soulless, grovelling forms of clay Laugh at the pangs they cannot chase away? Oh! what is memory, and what is hope? Memory! a dreamâwithin whose boundless scope All we have loved comes rushing o'er the mind: We wake to weep o'er joys we've left behind. Hope! 'tis the expectation unfulfilled, When all our fairest views are blightedâkilled; 'Tis the delusion sent, by heavenly care, To save mankind from horror and despairâ Delusion oft repeated, oft destroyed, That still deceitful fills the aching void Of hearts that cannot look beyond a scene Which soon may be as it had never been. Then she will cease, and gaze full wistfully On pity's tear, that trembles in mine eye, As if her glimmering light half served to show Elvira's wrongs had caused that tear to flow; And she will lay her hand upon mine arm, And raise those eyes of soul-subduing charm, Whose speaking rays of trembling blue unfold All that her wand'ring speech hath left untold; And, throwing back the locks her brow that veil, Will wildly whisper forth her mournful tale: âBright beneath dazzling painted lamps there shone The gilded splendour of the Spanish throne, While merrily the inspiring music sounded, And swift and gracefully the light foot bounded; And lords and ladies, oh! as bright and fair As stars in a dark heaven, were gathered there. But I saw one, in whose blue eye the light Than painted dazzling lamps was far more bright; The silver music of whose voice, to me Was sweeter than the sounds of minstrelsy; To whom more beauty of its kind was given Than any of those glancing stars of heaven: And as those beauteous orbs of light shine on, Reckless of whom or what they smile upon, So beautiful, so cold, my path he cross'd, Unconscious at each step a heart was lost; And one, which came as light and free as air, Fell from the height of joy to dark despairâ I saw but him, though he saw all but meâ Deep lies his image in my memory. And think not, loved one, though we part for ever, That bands the heart entwine so soon can sever; Oft, oh! still oft, shall steal across my soul The thoughts I vainly labour to controul; And as my parting look on Carlos fell, To think, though not to breathe, a sad farewellâ The tear unbidden started to mine eyes, Forlorn as Eve gazed back on Paradise.â Now she hath ceasedâher white arm raised on high, The soul of love is beaming in her eye; But memory soon hath quenched that meteor ray, And she hath turned to wend her weary way; And bending o'er her lute's bewildering strings, To hide her tears, thus mournfully she sings: Oh! are we doomed to part? And is thy maid forsaken? Then give me back my heartâ The heart which thou hast taken. The blushing flower is dead, Ere yet we see it blowing; And man's false love is fled, While echo breathes his vowing! As summer winds that blow, As rivers swiftly gliding; So quick her flight to woe, In such frail love confiding. Then steel your hearts, ye fair! Ere yet you feel them burning; For mine is gone, and care Forbids its e'er returning. Thus sings she, dewy flowerets weep to hearâ E'en the inconstant rose will drop a tear; And, as her sickening colour fades, will sigh To the sweet wanton zephyr wandering byâ âHark to that poor lost maid, how sweet she sings! To proveââwhat would she prove? âThat love has wings.â Carlos is gone, and quickly zephyr fliesâ The fond rose fadesâand sad Elvira dies. THE YOUNG CRUSADER. Clear and bright the moon was peeping From the fleecy clouds of snow; Near a young crusader sleeping, Thus a voice was singing low:â âPerjured false one, who could'st leave me! Leave thy hapless Moorish maid; Swear and vow, but to deceive me, See the price by Neilah paid! âSee these features, palely gleaming As the moonlight o'er the sea; These eyes, that late with love were beaming, Never more shall gaze on thee. âAs dies the shoot that's roughly parted From its ownâits parent tree, So thy Neilah, broken hearted, Diesâno more beloved by thee! âWounded, when the conflict's rattle Ceases, thou may'st seek repose, E'en upon the field of battle; But my wounds will never close. âYet thy Neilah still will love thee, Till friendly death shall end her woe; While the sun shall shine above thee, Shadows still his light must throw.â Starts the warrior, wildly raving, From the dream that breaks his sleep; His loved one, with her locks loose waving, O'er him seems to bend and weep. Repentant thoughts his mind revolving, He rushes towards the weeping fair; Like a flake of snow dissolving, With sighs his Neilah melts in air. Madly fought he on the morrow, Rage and love alternate burn; Quickly death relieves his sorrow, Faithless hearts may read and learn! WHILE I THINK OF YOU, LOVE! When the sun is shining brightly on a blithesome summer's day, While others dance and sing, I think on him who's far away; Amid the gay I wander on, as sad as sad can beâ Oh! while I think of you, love, do you think of me? When the evening shadows fall, love, and silence reigns around, And the weeping flowers shake the sparkling dew-drops on the ground; When the pale moon shines so mournfully upon the land and leaâ Oh! while I think of you, love, do you think of me? And when the night is come, love, and the weary sun is set, While others sleep, my constant eyes with tears the pillow wet; I rest in vain my aching head, where none my grief may seeâ Oh! while I think of you, love, do you think of me? And when other suitors come, love, to tempt with smiles and gold, And tell me that thy heart for me is passionless and cold, I turn in scorn and grief away, and say it cannot beâ When I always think of you, love, sure you sometimes think of me! On T. B. S. Blow, ye loud winds! roll on, thou restless main! For he we loved will never sail again! Once, as the vessel left the fading shore, We listened to the billows' reckless roar, And shrank in terror as we raised our eyes, And prayed for calmer seas and brighter skies, And gentler winds, to waft the young, the gay, Far from his native land, on stormy seas away!â But now, no more we raise that useless prayer, Vain are the prosperous gales and favouring airâ What reck we now that calm is every wave? The sunbeams fall upon his distant grave! What reck we that, calm rippling to the shore, They murmur round his bed, their sound shall wake no more!â Blow, ye wild winds! roll on thou restless main! For he we loved shall never sail again! Roll, ye tossed vessels! on the stormy sea, No bark brings back the young, the gay, the free! No more we watch each snowy sunlit sail That swells impatient in the homeward gale; No more we strain our orbs to that dark speck We fancied was the vessel, on whose deck The wanderer doomed, alas! again to roam, Stood gazing on that land, his ocean-circled home. His home! oh, say is that in English land? Then wherefore lingers he on foreign strand? His home! oh! far away on distant shore He lies, nor dreams of home or country more! No more those bright eyes sparkle at the soundâ âHaste! for the bark is now for Britain bound.â That warm light heart which bounded at each meeting, God gave the word, and it hath ceased its beatingâ Sail, ye tossed vessels! on the stormy sea, Bark after bark returnsâin vain! for where is he? THE DARKNESS OF THE GRAVE. The darkness of the grave hath bound him, A shroud, for cloak, is cast around himâ Night and day o'er his tomb I weep, But he hears me not, for he lies asleep! âCome back to love and life, my love! Come back and chase my woe, For the sun is shining bright above, And the flowers are fair below.â To the lone and cheerless tomb they bore him, And the chill cold earth they scattered o'er him; That heavy mould, as it heaped his bed, Fell on my heart like a weight of lead; And I sung, âCome back to life, my love! Come back and chase my woe, For the sun is shining bright above, And the flowers are fair below!â Light cannot pierce the earth above him, The gentle light of eyes that love himâ The sun cannot warm with its rays of gold, He hath come to his end like a tale that is told; âCome back! in vainâthose darkened eyes This world no more shall seeâ No more for thee shall beam yon skies, Nor flowers be culled for thee!â FAREWELL. âFarewell, my best belovedâfarewell!â Such were the sounds that came (Uttered with smiles), the last which fell From lips that loved thy name; And Heaven bless thee, wheresoe'er Those joyous footsteps roam, And guide, without a sigh or tear, My wanderer back to home! Farewell, my best beloved! 'tis past, Yet little did I deem That gay adieu should be the last Recalled in memory's dream. I could have wishedâthe wish is vainâ More sad had been the hour, Which beams through every thought of pain With agonizing power. For still through tears that dim my view, Through sobs that choke my breath, That vision, with its bright adieu, Forbids the thought of death! Farewell, I did not see thee die, I did not hear thy knell; Does sorrow, therefore, lighter fly? My best belovedâfarewell! SAY NOT 'TIS DARK. Say not 'tis dark!âthe night Is never dark to me; Around my couch they come in lightâ Visions I would not see. Forms I have loved,âas bright As in life's joyous years; Say not 'tis dark!âthe murkiest night Hath light enough for tears! BUT THOU! Delia! some few short years ago Yon fountain heard thee breathe a vowâ Still sparkling in the sunny glow, With murmuring sound and constant flow, That fount plays onâbut thou! Delia! a ringlet bright and rare, Which wantoned o'er thy snowy brow, In hours of bliss was given there; Time has not changed a single hair, 'Tis still the sameâbut thou! Delia! the heart that fondly loved, Loves thee despite thy folly now; Though thou hast seen its pangs unmoved, In sadness triedâin sorrow provedâ 'Tis faithful yetâbut THOU! I DO NOT LOVE THEE! ADDRESSED TO?. I do not love thee!âno! I do not love thee! And yet when thou art absent I am sad; And envy even the bright blue sky above thee, Whose quiet stars may see thee and be glad. I do not love thee!âyet, I know not why, Whate'er thou dost seems still well done, to meâ And often in my solitude I sighâ That those I do love are not more like thee! I do not love thee!âyet, when thou art gone I hate the sound (though those who speak be dear) Which breaks the lingering echo of the tone Thy voice of music leaves upon my ear. I do not love thee!âyet thy speaking eyes, With their deep, bright, and most expressive blueâ Between me and the midnight heaven arise, Oftener than any eyes I ever knew. I know I do not love thee!âyet, alas! Others will scarcely trust my candid heart; And oft I catch them smiling as they pass, Because they see me gazing where thou art. THE END.</field>
