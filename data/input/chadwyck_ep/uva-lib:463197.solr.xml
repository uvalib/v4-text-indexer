      <field name="fulltext">Theophilus. Prolog. De omni verbo otioso reddes rationem. 1 Iff ffor idle wordis accompte be for to make, Then for idle deadis a fortiore. To witnes thearin the scriptures I do take That worde and deade to God wold haue agree. Then to tell fable of unveryte, Other to penne, sith wrytinge doth remayne: In conscience, yt is a dampnable stayne. 2 O how endaungred in sowle then be theye, In letters of love that in them doth delyte? To mayntaynaunce therof Ã¾at lyste sundry weye, Other by theire meanys to the like texite? Or hystorye write of thingis farre unryte? Sith in Godes syght but truth onely alowde, How such before him their syn can they shrowde? 3 Or how can theye dampnation escape, That other by God or his saintis, anye Myracle much straunge forgingly can shape, For covetyse sake, as hath doone manye? O deade to abhorre most execrablye, To lye on him or his such lewde weye! That leyeris shall dampne att the latter deye. 4 He is the waye to eaverlastinge lyfe, Ego sum via, veritas et vita. And onlye verite, leadynge to the same; By lyinge on him, to raise then upp stryfe, Most worthye, I saye, eaverlastinge blame, And at the dome shall hyde their heddis for shame, Allthough not hable their syn oughtes to hyde, But doble daunger for the same tabyde. 5 Doble I meane their punyshment to be, For of an vntruth a truth to invente, Oother, to take yt for a veryte, By lyinge to seduce anye innocente. I busyed in hystoriall tallente, To wryte sith onelye my cheife exercyse. God sende mee from devysinge anye lyes. 6 To write or invent historyall style To the iuducynge of godlye vertue, To thabolyschinge vyce, to exile, As of Brasylla, whether false or true; With other that doth the lyke rate ensueâ As we haue busyed in sorte such wayeâ: No harme in wrytinge such thinge, I dare saye. 7 But to authoryse lye vppon God By cursed false imagination, From syn it ys no deale at all odde Of Godes vtter indignation, As, by his spyrite speakinge mendation, Leadinge to eaverlastinge perdition Heere and ellswheare, voyde of remyssion. 8 Yf to anye that readeth my traveyll, I shall be thought to wryte thinge contrarye, For my defense this greatlye maye adveyle: Right famous clearkis of Christys sanctuarye Hath sayde as I saye of the virgin Marye; And not vnpossyble in her to bee doone, Sith she furthered by her blessed soone. I. 9 Of Theophilus, which Chryste dyd forsake, Recovered by prayer his mother can make; Though God moste mervelously lyste to dyspose, After his dyvyne dyspensation, All thingis which the heauens and earth doth enclose, Also thinfernall habytation, Hydde, from certayne determination, Yeat not absolutlye to farre awaye, But by his meanys man maye of eyther saye. 10 In heauen, wee reade, a throne prepared is, In which on true God hath his reasydence. In maiestye such of ineffable blysse That moste farre passeth mannys intelligence, Which allweye newe by insufficience, The more beholdynge, more ioye doth encrese, Of which the assurance never to cease. 11 Where on deye hath allweye contynuaunce, Illustred by him that sytteth in throne. Night there none ys, or weathers perturbaunce, But allweyes quyetnes perfect alone. Theare all by charyte vnyte in one. What the Lorde will, thinhabyters the same, And eaven as theye wolde, so all thingis doth frame. 12 Oh who wolde not longe emonge such to dwell, Where reigneth everlastinge quietnes? O man, methinketh reason shoulde compell, Sith thowe thervnto arte ordayned no lesse, As all the scriptures doth playnlye expresse, Of which no dyfficultee is to obtayne. So thowe, of good will, liste heare to take payne. 13 The labore heere shorte who lyste to advue, Rightly to saye but momentanyall: The rewarde that after shall sure ensue, Most certayne taccompte, is ioye eternall. Oh who is hee then will not his wittis call Vnto remembrance, hym self to prepare To be of the sorte that so blessed are? 14 On earth man hath by proves experyence Of sun, moone and sterrs much parte to defyne, What theye move vnto, by there influence, Not of them selues, but by ordynaunce dyvyne, Man not to forse, but he lyste to enclyne. For of the wise man the sayinge is this: âSapiens dominabitur astrisâ. 15 Of herbe, stone and trees, with fruitis of the grounde, Man of theire natures hath vnderstandinge: Of ffyshe, fowle and beaste to saye and expounde, What cowlde, hotte or moyste beste for nurischinge, Or what ells noyesome to healthes hynderinge. In heauen and earth the Allmightye thus can Of his hydde seacretis declare vnto man. 16 In helle hee pleasethâlett man vnderstandeâ To be theare fyere inextinguable hotte; The place called the oblyvion londe, For that of God theye ar eaver forgotte; Thyther descendynge, that syn all by rote, Customablye, with out all repentaunce, For eaver therfore to taiste Godes vengaunce. 17 Theire portion appoynted by scriptures tellinge: Brymeston and sulphure with toadis sightis and smokes, And sore bytinge serpentis with venome swellinge, On them aye gnawinge, whose stingis neaver slake, With gnashinge of teeth for sorrowe that make. This knowledge hath man by Godes goodnes sente; By ordynaunce of lyfe to bee precavent. 18 All which highe knowledge in man infused, Not all at once, but seacretly grwe By processe of tyme, for thingis pervsed, As consequent doth antecedent ensue, Shadowes forgoinge which neaver man knewe, Tyll expyration seene to conclude, Then approbation the case dyd denude. 19 To this entente such thinge we do induce Howâafter oure Sauiour hadd satysfyed, By sheadynge his bloode, oure syn to excuse, Therin all redemption ratyfyed, And with oute that no meanes owghtes qualyfyed,â By longe tyme after, man standynge vpright, Christes death with baptisme inoughe dyd acquyte. 20 But man enclyned by processe of tyme More to the worldes vayne delectatyons, And to syn of fleschlye fylthye cryme, For all the scriptures godlye perswasyons, And to sundrye the ffyndes incantatyons, Of Chrystis death not forendinge the meryte, Or baptismes graces to haue in creadyte. 21 So proceadynge in synes greevous custome, As of the same no answere weare to make At tyme, when theye vnto iudgement should come, But heare their pleasure wolde thorowlye take; Tyll God pleased their spyritis to awake As tacknowledge the daunger of their synne; Then to amendmente this wise lyste begynne. 22 By pryde and presumption, as theye well thowght, Into the daunger of syn they firste fell, Wherfore through meekenes theye deemed they thought As to appease the penaltee cruell Off Godes indignation, that so doth swell Against synners, by longe accustominge His benygnytye not consyderinge. 23 Wherfore as thus they waged inwardlye, Moste farre vnworthye theyre lyppis to open, As to beseech theire Redemers mercye, Whose redemption theye hadd foregoten, Of which the scriptures so much hadd spoken: Therfore they caste by meekenes in theire mynde, Howe for his mercye they might best meanys fynde. 24 They thought,âsyth Moyses thorowe his prayer Towardes his people appeased Godes wrath, Allso Steaven that sawe in the ayre The heauen open to shewe thyther the path, By whose prayer Paule forgevenes gote hath,â The iuste prayer much deale for to prevayle, The wrath of God towardes synners to quayle. 25 Sith heare in earth, God lyste theire prayre heeare, And yeatt in flesche, ofte fallinge through the same: Howe muche more nowe in his presence so neare, Cleane delyvered owte of all fleshlye blame! Wherfore theire prayers they lyste as to frame Vnto such sainctis as theire myndis movyd, Ffor that theye weare heeare Godes freindis approvyd. 26 I not denye, but fullye dooe confesse, Chryste to his ffather sufficient is, Ffor synners of hym to geat foregevenes, Syth hys humayne flesche rawnsomed oure mysse. But hym forsakinge, maye not be thowght thys, Such parllye tasshame, hys helpe tentreate? So humelynge hym self maye sooner mercye geate. 27 The publycan hys iyen, that durste not elevate Vnto the heavins ffor his synnes weightynes, Ffor that he humbled him self in such rate, He geate of God moste cleane forgevenes. The prodygall chylde that thus dyd expresse He was vnwoorthye his ffathers sun to bee, The more in acceptation with hym was hee. 28 Why theye not desyred of sainctis anye ayde? Of saintis that tyme was no redemption. The aungellis weare not as then to bee prayde, For theye with man weare at great contention, Tyll he with Christe had his assencyon, By whose sufferinge on the crosse of tree Aungell and man weare sett at vnytee. 29 All this whyle to saynctis prayer was there none, But onlye to God, for synnes remyssion, And allthough nowe be, yeat thus to reason: He onely geveth thabsolution, And sainctis to praye after this condition: For that in charyte they eshtablisht are, Therfore as them sellues willinge all men to fare. 30 Emongest which synners, moste cursed of all, Of on we mynde heere playnlye to declare, Who neare into desperation dyd falle, Ffor that the ffynde hadd him so in hys snare, Of which the lyke I wish all men beeware, How eaver theye syn: not voluntarelye Chryste to forsake, as dyd this partye. 31 I wote sundrye shall at this make a ieste As thinge fryvolous and of none effecte. Right famous clarkis doth yt manyfeste, That ye beleve yt with out all suspect; And such as iestinglye doth yt reiecte, I yt referre tyll all truth shal be tryed, Them to make answeare that sayth I haue lyed. 32 Yeat, ere I begin in this to traveyle, O holye Ghoste, with all humble desyer I thee beseeche, with tearys trykelynge lyke hayle, With gyfte of thy grace thowe me inspyre, That I hearein walke so eaven, and no higher, But as onlye leadeth the veryte To specyall prayse of thye maieste. 33 Wheare I for my synne insuffycyent am, The somme to obteyne of this my requeste, O gloryous vyrgin, Marye by name, That suckelydste Christe with thye sacred brest, Assyste with thye prayer as thowe wotyst best, That yt bee to thye Sunnys contentation, And to eache honest mans acceptation. 34 Off one wee mynde at large heare to endyte, That cursedlye fell into ydolatrye, Which right ffamous authors lyste to recyte, As followeth in the hystorye. The more to alowe in my fantasye, To wryte fables that from truth doth dyscent, God shall, sayth Dauyd, sende theare punishment. 35 A certayne bushoppe, of cure pastorall, Hauinge greate numbers to pasture and feede With the sustynaunce of foode spyrituall, âWhich to his powre he attended in deede,â And for to supplye and helpe in that neede, An offycyall hee sett in the same, Playne to reherse: Theophilus by name. 36 Whose vertue with learninge he dyd aduert, And hym estemed meete to his purpose; In which sayde travayle tencurrage hys harte, That to exactlye he shoulde not encrose, Wherebye Goddes favowre hee might therbye lose, Hee gaue hym, worthelye him to mayntayne, In guerdon and recompence of hys payne. 37 Authoryshed to do in the sayde office, Moste worthelye hee dyd behaue in the same, Of his antecessoures hauinge the pryce; None earste (of longe tyme) so eavenlye to frame, Vertue to mayntayne, offenders to blame So accordyngelye in iudyciall wayes, That of the good he wanne then the prayse. 38 So contynued the sayde worthye man By so longe tyme as his busshoppe dyd lyue, Who into age so farre that season ran, That neer at deathes porte he muste then aryue, And death, in deede, dyd hys lyfe hense deprive To wheare was after lyfe eaverlastynge, For that he heare lyued thereto accordynge. 39 Not longe tyme after a neewe was choasen, Esteemed wortheye to steade in the place. Theophylus soone was then foregoaten, Accordinge much after the worldes olde trace. Newe lordis, newe lawes, newe offycers, lyke case; So that thoffyce which Theophilus hadde, A newe enioyed: which nothinge dyd him gladd. 40 Depryved his place, he tooke yt heavelye On wayes, for he was owte of estymatyon. An other not hable to mayntayne his maynye, Which earste to hym, dyd theire admynistration. Allso, not hauinge to hys sustentatyon, As before tyme, to mayntayne his estate,â Certayn, his harte yt dyd greatlye amate. 41 Hys men departed mvche heavelye awaye. Rewarde them he cowld not as hee gladlye wolde. Hys moveables mynysched deye by deye, Thorowe necessyte theye weare awaye solde. Smalle was to hym lefte of sylver or golde, Hym self to succoure, which hadd be no foarse. âThe goode not passethe of such sodayne coarse. 42 He hym contenteth with adversytye, And thanketh God what eaver doth befall. But thys man, puffed vppe with vayne glorye, Yt was to hym an encombraunce not small, And inwardlye frett, evin to the harte(s) gall, Not patyentlye sufferinge yt as he ought. Therefore God let hym in the ffyndes thrall be brought. 43 Asyde hee withdrewe him from companye, As fallen halfe into desperation, And went by him self all solytarylye, Castynge in mynde manye vaine cogitation. The deuill, readye with his instygation, Hym to exite by his cursed wooinge, That might bee to hys vtter undooinge. 44 So was hee fyred with that enemye fell, That he ne passed what of him became, All yf it weare to his daungeringe in hell, So he might atcheive to his former fame, Emonge the vayne worlye to beare a name.â A man, of all men most cursedly mynded, That so suffereth him selfe to bee blynded. 45 O most myscheuous commutation! Hec imitatio non dextera excelsi. This man, before honours exaltation, Lyved in lymitis of lief most gostlye, And now, thorough promotion, contrarylye Fallen from God. Alas the heavye case! So ofte doth honor depryue from all grace. 46 Bllynded by Sathans enveglynge such wise, Vnto a Iwe that season he doth goe,â Whiche in enchauntynge was passinge precise, And thorowe the dyvill much straunge thingis cowlde doe,â His case openinge, his purpose to come tooe, Protestynge: what eaver hee shall to hym laye, In moste certayne wise he will him obeye. 47 The Iwe proffessed to Sathan, his lorde, By whom hee lyved and dyd all his curys. To doe thys man helpe hee soone doth accorde, And therof, with out all dowbtes, he assures With wordis to the purpose that thus allures, So he be ordered as he showlde devyse, Or ells he cowlde make him no warantyse. 48 âCertayneâ, then sayde this fonde Theophilus, âYe shall fynde me fyrme at your commaundment. Not onse to astarte I promise you thus, Evin so longe tyme tyll my deyes bee heere spentâ. The Iwe with this answere helde hym content, And badde that he shoulde the morrowe, att eve, Repaire vnto him, his answere to preve. II. Ãis cursed sorcerer counseleth with Sathan for Theophilus, who commynge vnto him, renyeth hys christendome, Christe, and his mother Marye, geauinge to the ffynde hys wrytinge for confirmatyon of his promyse in the same. 49 Amyddes the night, when styrringe there was none, For all by nyght this cursed Iwe he wrought, To whom he serued made invocation, And was present in manner, at a thought. Obedysance makinge, as seemed hym he ought, Sayde in this wise: âOne doth youre helpe desyre, And will obeye to what ye will requyreâ. 50 âI well vnderstandeâ, answered the ffynde, âThe some and entent of hys hole requeste. Hym to receaue contenteth much my mynde, But thus I answeare at his entereste: I doinge for hym my vttermoste beste, Hee afterwardes awaye fro me to flyttâ Behovethe thearefore well to foresee ytt. 51 Is hee fyrmelye will hys faith as renownce, Which he moste fondelye to Christ hath profeste, And myne ordynauncys so to renounce (?) As I shall enflame in hys inwarde breste, I will condescende then to his behest, Informe him what doth behoue in Ã¾is case.â And hym present then before heere my faceâ. 52 The ffallse iuglynge Iwe wente home to hys house. At tyme appoynted Theophylus came, Inwardlye moste dyuillyshlye desyrous Of his belonginge to come by the same. The myscreaunte Iwe hys wordis dyd thus frame: âYf thowe, Theophylus, wylte haue thy mynde, Thowe muste then order thee after thys kynde. 53 Before hym that shall thy purpose redresse, When thowe shalte come immedyatlye a now, Thowe muste be well ware thowe doiste thee not blesse With sygne of the crosse, which Christe henge vppon. For yt in deade ys superstytion, Which he, my lorde, in no wyse can abyde; Therfore in anye wyse sett that asyde. 54 And what thowe so seeist, dysmaye thee nowhytt, For that thowe such syght sawe neaver before. Humblynge thye sellf downe, lowe at hys feete, And then to thye purpose thowe shalte heeare moreâ. With that hee ledde hym in at a lowe dore, Wheare Sathan sate, in stage of glytteringe golde, As Nabagodonosor, bade to beholde. 55 The deuill, hym seeinge, sayde to the Iwe: âWhom haste thowe heare brought before my presence?â âSirâ, sayde the Iwe, âI haue brought vnto you A sueter to haue of your benevolence, Who will you owe his trwe obedyenceâ. âThen muste heeâ, sayde Sathan, âif I him assyste, Renounce before mee the crucyfyed Christe, 56 With what ells he promysed in his baptysme, Which are to mee thingis moste farre odyous. Delyvered oute of that cursed scysme, I shall to hym shewe my favour gracyousâ. âSirâ, sayde the wicked Theophylus, âI am therwithall moste gladdlye contente. To what ye commaunde I wyllinglye assentâ. 57 Fferder yeate moreâSathanas agayne: âBesydes that is sayde, thowe shalte eke denye, For that myne owne thowe shouldiste eaver remayne, The mother of Christe, by name called Maryeâ. âI graunteâ, sayde the false departed partye, âI heeare doe forsake, her sonne, and all thinge That doth appertayne to their professingeâ. 58 âYeat not suffisethâ, saith false Sathanas, âAll thowe haste promyste, but this be also: I muste haue wrytinge concerninge Ã¾is case Of thye profession heere made me vnto, Which never meanys after maye seeme to vndoe. In steade of inke, thye blode muste testefye, And then what thowe wilte thowe shalt fynde readyeâ. 59 The cursed sorcerer then pricked his thyghe, And caused the bloode to issue owte bodde; Wherwith Theophilus gaue a great syghe, When he behelde the same how it bledde. And with a penne, on perchment readye spredde, He wrote, to hys shame, this testimonye: I Christe forsake and his mother Marye. 60 This Belyall bill written with his bloode, To Sathanas his acte he doth betake; Whom then answerde Sathan where he stoode: âUnto the cytye whense thowe came, nowe make, And I shall move the bisshoppe for thye sake. Bee not farre absent, but neeare to be founde; The soaner vnto thy profyte shall sowndeâ. 61 The Iwe hym conveyde from Sathans presence, And yeat with Sathan replenyshed was hee; Abroade beinge browght, he badde him parte thense, And when he hadde owghtes to his travayle see, Who promyste he showlde haue surelye hys fee. So with gladde harte departed companye, Although hauinge cause to be moste sorye. III. The deuill entreth the busshops harte, moveth him vehementlye for his clyent Theophilus, who restored to his firste estate, or rather much hygher, floryshed there in a space, tyll God by his holye spyryte vysited his harte to acknowledge his cursed wickednes. 62 Entringe the cyte, he heare and theare wente, And let not abroade hym self now to shewe, Though yeat not taken in state reverent, But letten wander emonge the rude crewe. The devill in the harte of the busshoppe dyd dewe His divillishe stirringis, nyght, deye, more and more, Theophilus to his olde state to restore. 63 Perswaded he was by the same illuser, He was a man moste vertuous and meete: Therfore to blame to bee hys mysvser, Owte of regarde to wander in the streete. Fferder thus more,âhe was moved as yeate, That but he shortlye dyd see to the thinge, God, sure, wolde plague him to hys vndoinge. 64 The busshoppe in deade, who was a good man, Though wexed with the vngratious spyrite, For this Theophilus searche make he can, And soone was he browght to the busshoppes sight; Who vnto hym with meeke appetyte Kneeled a downe, forgevenes askinge For hym so vngentelye mysentreatynge. 65 Supposinge thinstygations such wise Hadd comen of God, and not of the ffynde, Therfore much gladdlye he soone dyd devise To sette in the state hee before hadd resynde. So was the busshoppe by Sathan made blynde, And Theophilus resumd agayne His prystinate place with harte gladd and fayne. 66 All this was well to his hartes agreement, And, as before, florished much gayelye With greate abundaunce of lyvinge and rente, And servauntis on him attendinge daylye, Higher respected then a great maynye, By farre greater dealle then eaver before. So can the devill doe for all of his lore. 67 After longe season the Lorde of all light, That lightened the hartis of sundrye the blynde, And Peeter respected, though yt were by night, In Annas pallace in mercyfull kynde,â Who eavermore myndeth well to mankinde, That speciallye lyste there owne welth tattende, Theophilus harte pleased to accende. 68 And as the devyll wrought to his hinderaunce, And furthered to moste extremytee, So Christe him stirred vnto repentaunce, By knowing his fawte with all humylytee,â Though foyled in soyle of false ffragylyte, Though as drowned by longe consuetude, Yet avoyded by grace that is induede. 69 Wheare throwe the ffynde aboundeth malyce, Is made by Christe to afflowe with vertue, Who of his passion liste taiste the chalice, By proof of penaunce the same to ensue. His bloodsheadynge from the fynde shall rescue. Not so the devill to overthrowe is fayne, But Christe as readye to raise vppe agayne. 70 And nowe he pleaseth much mercyfullye Thencombred harte of this man to visite. For no good thought aryseth in anye But by infusion of Godes holye spirite, Who in this mannys conscience liste to alyte, Him as accusinge he hadd not doone well, Threatninge well worthye the sorrowes of hell. 71 Such motyons, by God, rysinge deye by deye, Owte of the cyte him selfe he withdrewe, For cyte is place, who wiselye liste weye,â Not beste for contemplation to ensue, Because of fonde sightis, that there doth renue Of worldelye pleasures acquaintaunce and such Which to synnes acknowledge hindereth much. 72 Walkinge of setteled purpose, Callinge to mynde hys myserable estate, Howe of the dampned, he was one of those, Him self verye cause of such cursed fate, Which to remeadye he thought yt to late: For weetingely so his Lorde to renye, Vnworthye, therfore, to haue his mercye. 73 Hee wandered forth with hartes encombraunce, His cursed fact inaudyte to saye: In eaverye behalf, the whole cyrcomstaunce, Neaver the lyke doone before the same deye, So purposelye to caste hym selfe awaye For mundayne glorye, vanyshinge so soone; Accomptinge him selfe for eaver vndoone. 74 âHalasâ, he sayde, âwhat happe is mee befalle, To doe that neaver dyd Christian before? Christian I was; no Christian nowe to calle. That name haue I loste nowe for eavermore. What eaver losse ells, some meanys maye restore; But losse so of sowle, which I am falne yn, Meanys I knowe none howe reamedye to wynâ. 75 So plunged in care of woues manyfolde, The mynde molested moste myserablye, The heavens over headde he lyste not beholde, For hee of the sight therof vnworthye, Whoe, geavin to the devill from the Allmightye; Of heaven and earth in eaverye condytion Vnworthye of them to haue anye fruition. 76 So as this wretche wente wandringe abowte, Moste myserablye in harte perplexed, Which waye to converte hym standinge in dowte, So, desperation to his greife annexed, No mervaile thowghe hee were throughly vexed, Who, so as hee, geaven hole to the dyvill, Maye saye: âTo his eavill compare maye no evyllâ. 77 Though Peeter his maister allso forsooke, Hee dyd yt not of propensed purpose. Ffrailtie of the fleshe hym sodaynlye overtooke, That hee not wiste what he saide vnto those Which on eaverye syde dyd him so enclose. What though a bye worde, vnwares, doe owte starte, It maye swre be sayde yt was not with his harte. 78 Some saye it was doone dyspensatiuelye, On other synners that he schowlde relente, For that hee was, certayne, a man much sturdye, Leste he with rigour might on much tormente; Hys owne falle consyderinge, therfore content Others the lyke meekelye to consyder, With them in repentance to ioyne together. 79 In all these sorowes departed the man Owte of all mennys syght, whether ne wiste, âAlasâ, allwaye sayinge, âmy chaunce I do banne, Who with his comforte maye mee owghtis assiste? Moste myserablye of all men vnblyste, My cause to anye I dare not declare, Sith to all men moste odyous ande rare. 80 I wretche, the wickedste that eaver dyd lyue, Not worthye the heavens with iyen to beholde, Myne owne vearye conscyence doth mee repryue, For that my sowle to the devyll Ih haue solde. How can I but sorowe a thowsande kynde folde? Yf tearys I might sheade, to graveyle in the seaye, Yeat not hable to weshe my synnes a weye. 81 I hauinge reason: Dygression with all, Traded longe season in literature, So purposedlye in daunger to falle Of Sathan, enemye to humayne nature, Of whom warned by dyvyne scripture, For that hee seeketh, each deye, night and howre, Whom hee maye thrall and vtterlye devowre. 82 To ffaule in hys daunger of setteled purpose, And that in sorte moste cursedlye to saye, How can I my mynde to anye disclose? But shame my doinge, to my dyinge deye, Ffor which I sighe and crye owte âwellawayeâ. Woe worth that eaver so cursed I was To geue my sellf cause to crye owte âalasâ! 83 What shall I nowe doe, what maye I devise, That owghtes maye bee my syn to reamedye? I neades muste abyde the divyne iustice, Of which dampnation the dwe penaltye. Oh, âwellawayeâ it forseth mee to crye. Some instincte of grace, good God, in mee infuse, Wherby mye sowle from hell I maye excuse! 84 Allthoughe off mercye I neaver maye deserue, âThe facte I haue doone I cannot make vndooeâ Sith reamedye none, but needes I muste sterue, Yeat will I neaver condescende thervntooe. The dyuill, it was playne, dyd mee therto wooe, And dyd mee enchaunte in his thrall to ketche. To yealde mee thervnto I graunte mee more wretch. 85 Notwithstandinge my synnes circumstance, Yeat not to despaire! For desperatio, âAs dyvyne authors maketh assuranceâ âEst enim peior omni peccatoâ. Though fearfull to the iudge to shue vntoe, I will to his mother, nearste of alye, Make meanys yf shee maye optayn mee mercyeâ. 86 Vnto a chappell, of easmente, hee went, Dedycate vnto the virgin Marye, âTo which on holly dayes by hamlettis went, For theire peroche church from them dyd farre lye,â In which Theophilus made hys entrye, Prostratinge him self before her image, In pyteous wise suinge to haue her suffrage. 87 âTo thee I speake not, thowe image present, But vnto the lyuelye Ladye soveraigne, Whiche highe in the heavins ys theare reasident, Whom this saide image representeth playne, Movinge remembraunce.âIn certayne kinde veyne, None otherwise myne adoration, But after hyperdulya fashionâ. 88 Prosterned such wise on the pavyment, With harte moste contryte as cause dyd constreyne, Bedewinge the same with tearys that owte wente, Like cunduite water, owte of iyen twayne, Troboled, God wote, in eaverye veyne, Notwithstandinge, in humbleste wyse he myght, He spake as followeth, none neare to impedyte: IV. The humble oration of the penitent synner Theophilus to the glorious virgin Marye, to be medyatrice to her moste mercyfull sonne for him in this his moste miserable falle and greate necessite, to be raysed by her, and reconcyled vnto grace againe. 89 âO glorious Ladye, preelecte of the Lorde Before heaven and earthes constytution! By seeade of the bodde, the worlde to be restorde, Thowe mayde continuinge in each condytion. Vouchsafe tattende my hartes contrytion, Bewrapped with care, never wretche the lyke, Drowned, but thowe helpe, in helles bottomlesse dyke. 90 My Lorde, thy sun, I dare not calle vppon, Ne invocate the name of Christe Jesu; For I haue learned, in scripture, longe agone, But by the holye ghoste that name to renue. I who then the devyll in mee doe indue, How can I worthelye calle on thy name, But to mye reproche, moste greevaunce and shame? 91 Yeat is hee my Lorde,âhe cannot denye, Though I haue of caste his recognysaunce. Over heaven and hell he hath the seignorye, To dooe and vndooe at his ordynaunce; Of whom I am rue in displeasaunce, So greevouslye farre that I am at staye, His mercye to claime by meanys anye waye. 92 How greevouslye eaver I haue offended, Yeat am I his, he can mee not deneye. Vppon repentance, my self amended, Hee maye, yf he please, take mee to mercye, Sith I his image, thowghe myserablye I haue it defaced, as open doth preve: I gaue that awaye was not myne to geeve. 93 But thus consyder with my self doe I: My syn so paste I can it not revoke. And, certayne, no ende is of his mercye, But that he bestoweth on Christian folke, Of which none am I, how eaver I cloake. Playne doth appeare in his knowledge dyvine How I weetinglye his faith dyd resigne. 94 O cursed the deye, the tyme and season, That eaver I fell so owght of my mynde! If I hadd be ledde by rules of reason, I hadde not swarved so farre owte of kynde. But reamedye none I wote nowe to fynde. Excepte thy maiestye helpe in the case, The tormentis of hell looke mee to embrace. 95 My case thowe knoweste by the glasse eterne, In sight of thye sonne, whom I haue transgreste, Worthye to be grownde in thinfernall querne, That scyndrethe in peeces by paynes manyfeste. I synner, with synne moste greevouslye oppreste, Beseache thy mercye, thoughe mearitinge none, For that with syn so passinge overgone. 96 Which syn, I acknowledge and doe confesse, To hyde yt is noe possybilyte, And of my self not hable to redresse, But to attribute to my fragelyte, Whoe graunteth to falle with all facelyte. But to aryse no weye I vnderstonde, But thowe, o Ladye, putte thy hande. 97 Yf anye in heauen maye helpe in this neade, Vnto thy sunnys fauour to reconcyle, Certayne I am thus perswaded in deade,â How eaver the fynde lyste anye beguyleâ Thowe cheeflye arte, maye helpe, at some while. For thowe hys mother, though he Lorde and Kinge, Yeat he, thy sonne, will denye thee nothinge. 98 And I beleeve, his will and pleasure is Thine honor to haue yt florishe ouerall, Sith thine in eaverye behalf is hys, Of whom thy graces spronge originall, All to his glorye in especiall, And will thow shouldest vnto all humain kinde, By powre of him helpe vs againe the ffynde. 99 That wheare hee dyd owre mother Eaue deceaue, And by her brought vs in bande and thrall, Thow sholdeste him of his power bereaue, When for thy ayde dyd eaver anye call: That as by woman owre myserable falle, So by woman oure raysinge vnto lyfe. Such is, o Ladye, thye prerogatife. 100 Sith then of heavin most soveraigne Queene, There florishinge more then anye queene heere! Allthough to my syn the like neaver seene, Yeat, glorious Ladye, my prayer thowe heare! Vnto thye sunnys throne thow sittinge so neare, Present thye self by mediation, To graunte of my synne some relaxation. 101 And what of penaunce I am hable to doe, I shall endeavowre vnto my lyues ende. Yff thow not helpe mee, I wote not ells whoe Maye steade in this neade, my sowle to defende. My speciall truste on thee I dooe impende. Ffor thy sonnys mercye and passion smarte Shewe some favor to easement of my harteâ. 102 By three deyes space, and three nyghtes ensuinge, This wretched synner on grounde grovelinge laye, For anye sustenaunce neaver removynge, But styll to the blessed Ladye dyd praye, Though not orderlye as wee do heere saye, But with much more mateirs efficacye, For that so longe tyme hee dyd occupye. V. After thre nightes space the glorious mother of God appeared vnto Theophilus, greevouslye chalenginge him for his myserable ffacte; after which mercyfullye willinge him to persyste in his penitent purpose, and shee wolde doe what her gloryous sonne wolde admytt for his reconscyliation. 103 Att thirde deyes nyght, the mother of mercye, Moved with pyttye towardes this sinner, Shewed her selfe to this sorowfull partye, Though at the firste in much dreadfull manner, For that hee was vnder the devylles baner; To whom this gloryous heavenlye Empresse After this sorte her pleasure dyd expresse: 104 âO manâ, shee sayde, âyf man I maye thee call, But rather much more impe of the fowle ffynde, For that thow art become his certayne true thrall, Against the nature of all humaine kynde; For thowe, ordayned by Goddes will and mynde, Of that traytor in glorye to supplye, Haste geaven thee to him, to Godes will contrarye. 105 Who gaue thee boadye, sowle, wytte and reason? Hee whom thow haste choasen to thy governoure? Who payde thy raunsome in neadfull season, When thow were captiue vnder the ffyndes powre? Thy maister nowe the authour of errowre! Whoe geaveth lyfe, after thys lyfe is spent? âThe devill, thy lorde, that cursed serpent? 106 No, wicked person, theis graces each one, With other all that number anye can, God high in heaven, that sitteth there in throne, Them gaue vnto thee, and to eaverye man. Howe happened thee to goe from hym than Vnto his enemye moste vttermoste to saye? No such of his mercye maye haue anye waye. 107 I wote his mercye doth passinglye abounde, But that on synners thus doth bestowe, That fall of frailte, and lyste not compounde For this worldes lukre.âThe ffynde to followe, As thowe haste doone,âall the heavens doth yt knowe,â Thowe not therto dryven, but of sett consent, Howe canst thowe of mercye desire the talent? 108 What though promotion gan thee to fayle, Shalt thowe to the devill geue thy self therfore? Doth not blessed Paule geue all this counceyll, None such to seeke after lesse other more, But as shall please God therto to restore, Sith daunger thearin? Thowsandis hath agreede To wrappe them in willfull povertyes weede. 109 Or how darest thowe to invocat(e) mee To shewe thee anye auxiliation? Fforsakinge my sun, thus playne doth agree To dooe mee the lyke vytuperation. O cursed caytif! worthye dampnation For of thy facte, that is the condygne pryce Yf thow receaue, accordinge to iustice. 110 In deade, to synners I am debonayre, That synneth thorowe the ffyndes entysement, And am readye to heare theire prayer, With what I can doe to there hartes easment. My Lorde and sun is therwith all content. But such as thow, thy self to caste awaye,â Thy case so greevous, I wote not what to sayeâ. 111 Theophilus, hearinge her grevous challenge, His harte it was perced, eaven thorowe owte, In manner as doore hanginge half by the henge, Of anye her helpe standinge in great dowbte. With cheere amated, he lowlye dyd lowte, And as he cowlde from weepinge snobbis forbeare, Sayde his mynde, in sorte as ye shall heare: 112 âO glorious Ladye, your sayinge is moste true, I haue most cursedlye wandred astraye, And neaver worthye hys mercye to endue, If in eavin ballaunce my synne hee dooe waye. Oughtes for myne excuse I no wise can laye, But to acknowledge, with lachrimable iyen, Never anyes syn to be accompted to myne. 113 I shame, o Ladye, to shue vnto thy grace. I shame to name the glorious name of thyne. I shame to thinke on thy bewtyous face. I shame, owte of kinde so farre to declyne. I shame that I am besoyled lyke swoyne. I shame my creatour so soare to offende. I shame that I am on of the ffyndes bende. 114 Woworth this worldes false glytteringe glorye! Woworth hys honors that syn doth entyce! Woworth, in hym are thowsandis so sorye! Woworth then all his pleasures and delyce! Woworth no better is all hys devyce! Woworth the tyme I spent my tyme therin! Woworth wherbye I fallen am in syn! 115 I can but sorowe my greevous offence. I can but humblye acknowledge the same. I can for remyssion make noe pretence. I can on my self but laye my synnes blame. I can but hyde mee in corner for shame. I can by no meanys my trespace conseale. I can but, as gyltye, for mercy appeale. 116 My bodye, my sowle, with reason and wytte Receavinge of God, with benefytis all: So negligentlye from such Lorde to flytte, Myne ingratytude not to accompte smalle, Which soare I lament, and eavermoore shall, Besechinge thye mercyfull motherlye pyttee, Vnto thy sun my advocatryce to bee. 117 And whille in this lief I haue my beinge, I shall, with moste warefull and vygylante iye, Beware the lyke falle, by thys falle feelinge, And take thee for my soveraign Ladye, Honorynge thee hyperdulyallye Aboue all creatures, next to thye sun, For that, by thee, meanys vnto liefe begunâ. 118 The mercyfull Queene that willeth all well, Adnotinge hys sorowes thorowe fullye, Shee wylde hym in that good purpose to dwelle, And shee wolde move to her sun allmyghtie As to vouchesafe to take hym to mercye, Shewinge him theare passinge soveraigne; Sayinge, ere longe shee wolde see him againe. 119 Oh so that sight lightyned hys harte, So specyall sweete at her departure; Though firste to hym shewinge her self smarte, Shee soone relented and tooke of hym cure, For ferther comforte which dyd hym assure. The inwarde reioysinge, that hee dyd take, I cannot therof rehersall heare make. 120 Then was hys harte moste vehemente on fyer By inwarde contryte contemplation. No earthlye comforte hee owghtes dyd desyer, His tearys weare meate. To his contentation Inough suffysed the consolation Of that noble celestiall Empresse, That shewed her self in hys neadfull dystresse. 121 Hys tearys he doboled of joyfull entent, In hope of hys synnes full remyssion. Bedewed all abowte was the pavyment With the vearye tearys of hys contrytion, Full myndinge to leaue all olde condytion, And to become, his lief contynuinge, A true penytent to Goddes pleasinge. VI. Of the moste humble and motherlye medyation of the glorious vyrgin Marye to her moste gloryous sonne and Lorde for the poore penytent person (Theophylous), of his gracious perdoninge him for hys mercyes sake and her meeke supplication, and howe moste benygnlye and chearfullye shee acertayned hym of the same, to hys most great comforte and emendation of lief. 122 Off this saide synner the pyteous complaynt Admounted the heavins, before the mercye seate; To whom there syttinge, thys Ladye most quaynte In humblest wyse sued his perdon to geate, And after this sorte her sonne dyd entreate: âO Lorde and Kinge! of mercye springinge well, Vowchsafe to heare the sute that I shall tell. 123 Yon wretche, which thee hath offendyd so sore, For thye mercyes sake forgeve hys offense At my supplication somewhat the more, Heere kneelinge on knee before thye presence. Accept, gratious Lorde, hys hartes penytens. So heynowse a syn, foregeaven in theis deyes, For evermore shall redounde in thye preyes. 124 Remember, hee ys thye creature, perdye, Formed vnto thy gloryous image. What though hee hath doone moste myserablye, So greevous no syn, but mercye maye asswage. Yon enemye, the ffynde, brought hym in Ã¾at rage, That ravyshed owte of reasons iudgement, Hee wrought that right sore hee now doth repent. 125 Remember thy dolorous peyne on the crosse, Which thow for synners such as hee dydst sustayne. Of such on repentant greevous were the losse; So weare vnto hym thy passion in vayne. Thye wonted mercye on hym lette remayne, And I, gratious Lorde, betwene hym and thee, For amendment of lief his suretye shall bee. 126 Remember, in earth I was thye poore nurse. Thow willedste mee so before women all. Ffor my sake nowe let him not fare the worse, Sith he, in his neade, for my ayde lyst call. I neades must for thy sake helpe eas(e) this thrall, Ffor that vnto thee hee onse dyd belonge, I loth am, therfore, to see him take wronge. 127 Oure enemye, the ffnde, him wrongeth in this waye, On hym makinge sawte to fall into syn. Of malyce he doth yt, as I dare saye, In youre displeasure to bringe him therin. No one hee letteth goe, but layeth his false synne, As by this poore Theophilus doth prove, Whois heavye hartes greif thow graunt to remove. 128 In earth, sith I dyd thee my obsequye, As pleased thye maiestye mee to assigne, And, at thy deathe, with thee readye to dye Of motherlye loue that so dyd enclyne; Sith peyne of thy passion was partlye myne: My boone nowe gravnte thow, of thy great goodnes, Ãat synners trespasse clearelye to releaseâ. 129 âRight deare belovidâ, answeared that Lorde, âYour humble requeste I cannot denye. To what your self will, I gladdlye accorde. So to amende all former myserye, Ffor your sake towardes him such my clemency: Sithe I will ye showlde be synners refuge, For whom ye dooe praye, I beare shall no grudge. 130 My ffather, I wote, as I will, will he, Who hath mee geaven the iudgement ouer all,â And thus I doe meane for to demeane mee: Who vnto penaunce for hys syn doth falle, Ceasinge therfrom as hym behoue shall, I cannot but neades, of brotherlye loue, My wrath from all such vtterlye remove. 131 Of humayne nature I knowe the frailtee, And of our enemye the great vexation; In which streyte neadis man callinge vpon mee Shall haue assiste in that certation. But therto geavinge inclynation, Then can I not, but penaunce come betweene, Accordingelye iudge as lief in sight is seene. 132 Your sute, therfore, concerninge yonder man, Take and doe with him what your pleasure ys; Advertise and counsaile as ye beste can, To enter againe into owre service; And that your kindnes hee not overmysse. For what to your prayse by hym shall admounte, As doone to owre self we shall yt accompteâ. 133 âMoste soveraigne Lordâ, answearde that Queene, âAll honoure be yours in eaverye place: To on Godhead which in three persons beene, Ffather, Sun, Spyrite, geaver of all graceâ.â In moment of thowght, which is but short space, The gloryous Ladye her self dyd present To fore Theophilus, that poore penytent, 134 Sayinge vnto him much mercyfullye: âThowe servaunt of God, doe gladlye aryse! My soveraigne sun hath sent thee mercye. As rysinge from grounde, so rise from all vyse. Thy penaunce appeased hath his iustice. While tyme in this worlde thow shalt haue to lyue, This reconscilement in thee lett revyve. 135 And myne endeaver doo thow not forgett. For what of honore thow gavest vnto mee, I whoallye referre, in manner moste greate, Vnto my sunnys dyvine maiestee; Which, as but on Godhead is certayne to bee, And but on will in the Trynyte fownde, So all laude and praise to that one redoundeâ. 136 Theis wordis rehersed, departed that sight, Which to Theophylus was syght soveraigne. So wonderfullye his harte yt dyd light, That hee, contented to see yt agayne, Though so might not, in harte yt dyd remayne, And rysinge vppe from wheare as he dyd lye, These wordis as ffolloweth hee spake bye and bye: VII. Of Theophilus moste earneste rendring thankis to Christe Jesue and his gloryous mother for hys reconciliation to his mercye agayne: receavinge allso hys byll of abnegation. Hys offise and goodis, goaten bye the devill, he vtterlye dyd fforsake, geavinge him self from thensfourth whoallye to amendement of lyef. 137 âO what maye I saye, contryve or devise By all the powers and wytte in mye headde, Prayse worthye to saye in anye manner wyse, In sight of oure Lorde worthelye to steade For mercye, this season to mee mynistred By his deare mother, floure of womankinde, Godes speciall choasen toverthrowe the ffynde? 138 But I can, o Kinge and Lorde of all! I render thankis, prayse, honor and lovinge To thye devyne maiestye eternall, For mee vnto thye ovyle restoringe, As speciallye ys mee behovinge, Beseachinge thye grace therwith to assiste That I neaver be owte of the same mysteâ. 139 A while departinge owte of the chappell, With somewhat to refreshe his longe fastinge, Returninge agayne, on face he downe fell, As earste before, thus pyteouslye sayinge: âO blessed Ladye, I geue thee praysinge For thye moste mercyfull releavinge of mee, For which for eaver moste bounden vnto thee. 140 But, blessed Ladye, on suite haue I more, In which I beseeche thye mercyfull ayde: My cursed handwrytinge as to restore, That to my confusion yt be not layde, Of which I am moste grevouslye afrayde, Leste when in iudgement I shall be made stande, Be layde againste me my owne wrytinge handeâ. 141 To prayer he went moste earneste agayne, The blessed Ladye to helpe in that case. On sleepe hee soone fell, as God dyd ordayne, And therin continuinge no longe space, To whom happened this singuler grace: He awakinge, the wrytinge he dyd fraye, Depryved the ffynde, vpon his breste laye. 142 Which he receauinge was passinge gladde, And rendered thankis to the Allmightye, For that agayne his hande wrytinge he hadde,â And to the gloryous virgin Marye, Whom all hys lyef after, as good cawse whye, He hadd in honor, nexte to her blessed soon, For the mercyes shee hadd vpon hym doon. 143 All this thus browght to good conclusion, Theophylus then became a newe man. The devill, which seekethe mannys confusion, At our Ladye he cursed and dyd ban, That of his praye thee so depriue hym can. So hadde he not the fyrst woman at wyll, But contrarywise, this other to fullfyll: 144 Theophilus, rydde owte of the ffyndes thrall, He meant never more with him to meddle. His lief, yt was then so penytentyall, In which his mynde so firme he dyd settle, That he seemed formed of a newe mettle: So fraile not before to falle in myssehappis, As after warefull tavoyde all relapsis. 145 Hys office he let then take yt who wolde. His servantis, he sett now bye there servise; He wolde be maister no more of howsholde. He hadd to him take farre better advyse. The worldes vaine pleasure no more him tentyse, To which he became as man crucyfyed, And hee to the world, for he yt denyed. 146 Hys goodis that so rose to him by the devyll, The dyvill and his servauntis, the worlde, he let take. For he is author of eaverye evyll, Whateaver he doth, to eavill ende doth make. No more he myndede to come in his brake. As childe onse burned of fyer will beware, Theophylus so tavoyde the devylles snare. 147 Hys mynde from the earth was upwardes elevate, Of purpose to seeke celestiall thingis. All wordlye vnder foote he dyd conculcate, For that to sowles health no good thynge yt bringeth. The gloryous Ladye he ofte in mynde myngeth, How her to serve and here sun magnyfye, That had for him doone so mercyfullye. 148 Beseach God hee dyd with tearys yssuinge, His harte to illumyne so with hys grace, That nyght ne deye his lief contynuynge Otherwyse then well; to spende tyme nor space But to all goodnes; his harte vnlase, Hys former fraile lief to haue yt present Before hys iyen, worthelye to lament. 149 Thus geavin from the worlde whoallye to God This Theophilus wee certayne nowe see, From chaunge earste before a great deale farre odde, As when hee from God to the devill dyd flee. From good so to badde is chaunge to pytee, But chaunginge from evyll the lyfes conversation, Of all that is, sure, the best commutation. VIII. Theophilus, restored to his pristinate state, thought yt not goode (or hys partye) to conceale so great a myracle, wherfore he went to the busshope theare then, a much godlye man, and opened to him all the whoale cyrcumstaunce therof, contented to haue yt publyshed to the people, to the glorye of God and his moste blessed mother, the virgin Marye. 150 All this transacte, overpaste and gone, Theophilus, quieted in conscience, With in hym self condescended anon,â This myracle of so great excellence To haue yt hydde and shrowded vnder scylence, He thowght yt dyd to the contrarye tuche, For that Godes honor yt sette forth so much, 151 Allso his glorious mothers great deale, The lyke neaver seene in practice before; Wherfore such thinge to couer or conceale, He thowght in conscience to be great sore, Although to his shame yt make an uprore Of admyration before the worldes sight. So better then God to reaue of hys right. 152 All shame of the worlde sett vtterlye aparte, All drede of the same what eaver myght befalle, He fullye determined in his harte, His shame to God a glorye appeare shall. Unto the busshoppe he dreste him forth with all, In seacret beseachinge him reverentlye To heare of his mynde a certaine secreacye. 153 The busshoppe much gentelye graunted his request, And went a parte to heare what he wolde saye. None neare save theye twoe, avoyded the reste, To whom Theophilus opened furthe weye All the whole matter as in hys mynde laye, In such penytent and sorowfull wyse That tearys distilled a downe from his iyes. 154 The reverende ffather hearinge the case Of thys synners to grace conversion, He magnyfyed God eaven in the same place With tearys owt of his iyen conspersyon. Who in hell floodis havinge submersion, To be delyvered such myracul(o)us wise, He ioyed, with ioyes farre passinge to devise; 155 And sayde vnto hym much amyablye: âDeare brother, while heare thowe haste thy beinge, Haue in remembrance Godes specyall mercy, Which he hath shewed thee concerninge this thinge; And of his mother bee not forgettinge. Great cause thowe haste, and for hundreth thingis moe, Emonges which let never this owt of mynde goe. 156 And behoveth thee great penaunce to indue, For great the cause of thys myserable fall, And great Godes mercye, that thee doth ensue: Therfore great repentance in especyall. This myracle so myrificall, It owght be revealed to Goddes glorye, And to the praise of the virgin Maryeâ. 157 âO ffatherâ, he sayde, âI will yt no lesse, Beseachinge your ffatherlye reverence To cause be convented a populous presse, I beinge by you before there presence, To whom the Lorde Criste shewed to hys defense; Ye, to his honoure, openinge the same, I, for my syn, contented to bare blameâ. 158 Then caused the busshoppe a bell to be ronge, Which over the cyte gave a great sownde. Ere longe to the temple came a great thronge, Wheare in the same the busshoppe theye founde, And hym envyroned abowte rownde, Advaunced on hyghe, the more to be espyed, The penytent person standinge by hys syde 159 In pyteous wise, with tearys yealdinge owte, Not droppe meale, but passinge aboundantlye, Bare foote and bare legge, I put you owte of dowbte, And in sackeloth coate moste penytentlye. Overmuch to good hee thowght yt certaynlye, Whois pyteous spectacle movyd to pyttye All there then present of that noble cyte. 160 Scylence requiered, the reverende ffather, To whom the charge of the cure dyd belonge, Pawsinge as he sawe the people gather, Tyll comen so manye as lyste there amonge, Ceasinge the bell, that longe tyme hadd ronge, Vnto the people theare then in presence Under this manner opened hys sentence: 161 âWee, right wortheye audyence, heere gathered thys tyde, Set in owre offyce, Goddes glorye to mayntayne, You to instructe by all wee can provyde, With lyves example and gostlye foode agayne,â Endeavoringe therin moste gladde with the payne,â Haue at this season cawsed this convention Onelye and specyallye for this intention: 162 The mightye soveraigne Kinge of kingis all, The onlye God that created all thinge, And reigneth above in blysse eternall, Which will of no synner the pearishinge, Hath at this daye, to hys worthye praysinge, And to all synners specyall comforte Shewde myracle straunge, which wee shall reporte. 163 This poore penytent which yee heere beholde, Seduced by the envyous serpent, With Sathan entred this bargaine bolde, And sowlde his sowle, which sore he doth repent, Renouncynge the Christian sacrament, Allso oure saviour, Jesus by name, With allso hys glorious mother the same; 164 Off which he made an obligation Write with his blode, to make the more sure, Geavinge the same with hartes contentation, To bee hys servaunte for eaver to endure. But God throwgh his mercye of him takinge cure, Infused his grace in specyall wise, Which fullye moved hys fawte to recognise. 165 This saide present person seduced such waye, Comen to him self, tooke great repentaunce, Ashamynge hys syn to goe so astraye From him that hath all in hys governance, And thought him vnworthye for his inconstance To call vpon him for hys reamedye, Humblinge him self to hys mother Marye. 166 Though so neaded not, sith hee all thingis maye, To whom referred all kinde of iudgement, Yeat so he wolde yt as wee maye well saye, Sith happened quoit(?) so playne and evydent, To whom to his praise her fame more excellent; For shee but dothe at his exitation, Therfor to his cheiff commendation. 167 But shee the instrument whearbye hee wrought Our humaine kinde to grace to reconcayle, Bye fflesche on her takinge Ã¾at vs on roode bought. He pleased in this his myserable exile To sende her to bringe him to hys ovyle, Through whose entreatance in this greevous case Shee brought him agayne into her sonnys grace. 168 Wherfore she is to bee highlye honored, Both for her owne and sunys specyall sake; Although of him her honoure borowed, Yeat never the lesse his honour to aslake, For, certayne, her honor to hys doth make, For shee of him her graces havinge all, To him then, of due, the honor to falle. 169 To this ende, o moste Christian audyence, This noble acte to you I doe declare, To praise of Godes moste highe magnifycence, Who wolde the death of on Christian synner, How eaver greevous hee happeneth to erre: Much more readyer our synnes to forgeive Then wee, through our meanys, him therin to meve. 170 This shippe which was loste, hee fownde it agayne. This prodygale childe is come to peanaunce; Who beinge late deade, as syn can ordayne, Ys nowe revyved: such his happye chaunce. This odyous leaper of his encombraunce Delyvered, and of blynde made to see: Such the great goodnes of Goddes maiestee. 171 This I rehearse heare to all in presence, Of the like falle for eaver to beware; What eaver mysfortune maketh penitence, Not so, wetinglye, tenter the dyvilles snare; How eaver, through syn; of grace made bare, Yeat never to despaire of Goddes mercye, As this to vs all maye examplyfye. 172 And what thoughe this man hath roved astraye, Him to abhorre, revyle or deteste Behoveth vs not in anye kinde waye, âSith with forgeuenes God hathe him nowe bleste,â Therefore to him nowe none his syn to keste. Who of you all from syn is all cleare, Throwe stone at hym firste, yf he dare appeare. 173 When anye of vs with wetinge consent Commytteth syn mortall, wee Christe do forsake. Then owght wee on this poore synner relent, And not at his greif a iestinge to make, By his example but rather to take Occasion to ryse from such mortall state, Syth syn none so huge but God maye mytigate; 174 To whom bee all honour, dignyte and prayse In sorte as to him moste specyall is dwe, And to settinge forth the same in more wayes, âFor that all graces by him doth ensue,â Be praise to the mother of Christe Jesu, Moste glorious Ladye, by whose medyation Theophilus founde the weye to salvationâ. 175 Then made this reverende bushoppe to synge In praise to God for this myracle greate, The cantycle of moste worthye praysinge, âTe deum laudamusâ, to the purpose moste meate, He helpinge therin in his cathedrall seate. So of Theophilus an ende wee make, Who vnto relygion the waye dyd take, 176 Theare leadinge a lief moste penytentiall In fastinge, prayinge and other penaunce, To thexample of other synners all, That lyste there syn haue in consyderaunce, Tyll God of his mercye sawe suffisaunce. Then tooke hee him owte of this carcerall payne, With him in his roialme for eaver to raigne. 177 Bruited abroade this great myracle than, Honor to God dyd eaverye wheare spred, And to his mother that so in neede can Doo helpe to synners so hardlye besteade. Then weare orations to her offred, Servyces songe all Christendome thorowe, So farre as anye of this thinge dyd knowe. 178 And more and more as the fame therof grw, Christian devotion to her dyd encrease. Who furthered therin dyd neaver yt riw, But theye to haue cause that cause yt to cease. In sayinge truthe, none neade hold his pease; âTo whom I refferre, yf truthe I haue sayde; The rewarde of truthe she see mee then payde. F(f)inis 27. octobris 1572 per me Guilelmum Forrestum. 179 To confirmation of this historye The Catholike church of antiquyte Sounge in prayse of the glorious Ladye: âTu Theophilum reformans gratiaeâ. God, her son, wolde her magnifyed to be, Whose freindis to David honorable weare. Then who so specyall as Christys mother?</field>
