      <field name="fulltext">THE MEDAL REVERS'D. A SATYR Against Persecution. How easie 'tis to Sail with Wind and Tide? Small force will serve upon the stronger side: Power serves for Law, the wrong too oft's made right; And they are damn'd, who against power dare fight. Wit rides triumphant in Power's Chariot born, And deprest Opposites beholds with scorn. This well the Author of the Medal knew, When Oliver he for an Hero drew. He then Swam with the Tide; appeared a Saint, Garnish'd the Devil with Poetick Paint. When the Tide turn'd, then strait about he veers, And for the stronger side he still appears. Then in Heroicks Courts the great, and high, And at th' Opprest he lets his Satyrs fly. But he who stemms the Tyde, if ground he gains, Each stroke he makes must be with wondrous pains: If he bears up against the Current still, He shews at least he has some Art and Skill, When against Tide, Wind, Billows he does strive, And comes at last unto the shore alive. Huzza my Friends, let us our way pursue, And try what our Poetick Arms can do. This latter Age with wonders do abound, Our Prince of Poets has a Medal found, From whence his pregnant Fancy rears a peece, Esteem'd to equal those of Rome and Greece. With piercing Eyes he does the Medal view, And there he finds, as he has told to you, The Hag Sedition, to the Life display'd, Under a States-man's Gown; fancy'd or made, That is all one, he doth it so apply; At it th' Artillery of his Wit lets fly; Lets go his Satyr at the Medal strait, Whorries the Whiggs, and doth Sedition bait. Let him go on, the Whiggs the Hag forsake; Her Cause they never yet would undertake, But laugh to see the Poets fond mistake. But we will turn the Medal; there we see Another Hag, I think as bad as she: If I am not mistaken 'tis the same, Christians of old did Persecution name: That's still her Name, tho now grown old and wise, She has new Names, as well as new disguise. Let then his Satyr with Sedition fight, And ours the whilst shall Persecution bite: Two Hags they are, who parties seem to make; 'Tis time for Satyrs them to undertake. See her true Badg, a Prison or the Tower; For Persecution ever sides with Power. Our Satyr dares not worry those he shou'd, But there are some felt, heard, and understood; Who Substantives of Power stand alone, And by all seeing men are too well known; What steps they tread, and whether 'tis they drive, What measures take, and by what Arts they thrive: But were these little Tyrants underfoot, How bravely o're them could our Satyr strut! What Characters, and justly, could he give, Of men who scarcely do deserve to live! Yet these are they some flatterers can Court, Who now are Persecutions great support. We on the Medal see the fatal Tower; Truth must be silent, for we know their power; Whilst they, without controul, can shew their hate, And whom they please, with grinning Satyrs bait. This puts our Satyr into fume and chase: He could bite soarly, could he do it safe. Since against such he dares not spend his breath, Th' Hag Persecution he will bait to death. Old as the world almost, as old as Cain, For by this Hag was righteous Abel slain; In Tyrants Courts she ever doth abide, Accompanied with Power, with Lust and Pride. What she has done is to the world well known: She always made the best of men to groan: Her bloody Arts are register'd of old, And all her cruel Policies are told. All that is past our Muse shall let alone, Pass Forreign, and speak only of our own; Our own dear ugly Hag, who now has power, To send to Tyburn, Newgate, or the Tower. If Power be in the Multitude, not few, They shew that they have Faith and Reason too, Leap not their bounds, nor do their power betray Since they to Laws, and Government obey. If other power they exercise, 'tis force, Or rage, that's seen in a wild head-strong Horse; The more he's spurr'd or reind, the more doth bound, And leaves not, till the Riders on the ground But far it seems from our Almighty Crowd, To boast their strength, or be of power proud: Their power they of old had fruitless try'd, And therefore now take Reason for their guide. Nay Faith they have in their own juster Cause, In their dread Soveraign, and his righteous Laws; This makes them thus submit; all power lay by, For Right, for Law, for Peace they only cry: For this, by some, they are accounted Fools. So generous Horses are mistook for Mules; And some Court Jockies mount them in their pride, And with a Satyr's heel spur-gall their hide, Dull asses they suppose the People are, Made for their burthens, and not fit for War. All with the fore-wind of Religion Saile; It to all parties is the Common stale. I know you'l grant the Devil is no Fool, He can disguise in Surplice, Cloak, or Cool; But still he may be known without dispute, By Persecution; 'tis his Cloven Foot. Let him be Christian, Pagan, Turk, or Jew, Pretends religious zeal, it can't be true, If 't Persecution raises, or maintains, Or makes a Market of ungodly gains. VVhen Rome had power here, and sate inchair'd, How cruel and how bloody she appear'd! Our Church Dissenters then did feel the same, Their Bodies serv'd for fewell to the flame: And can this Church now got into the Chair, A Cruel Tyrant like to Rome appear? For bare Opinion do their Brothers harm, Plague, and Imprison, 'cause they can't Conform? But stay, our Church has Law upon its side: And so had Rome, that cannot be deny'd, And if these Jehu's, who so fiercely drive, In their sinister Arts proceed and thrive, We soon shall see our Church receive its doom, And feel again the Tyranny of Rome. To bar Succession is th' ungodly sin, So often broak, so often peec'd ag'in. O may it here in England never cease, Could we but hope it would secure our peace! But men with different thoughts possessed are, VVe dread the effects of a new Civil VVar. We dread Romes yoak, to us 'tis hateful grown, And Rome will seem a Monster in our Throne. How rarely will a Cope the Throne bedeck? A Bishops Head, set on a Princes Neck? Th' inherent Right lyes in the Soveraign's sway, But then the Monarch must Romes Laws obey. Head of the Church he must no longer be, But give that place unto Romes holy See. Both of the Church, and him Rome will take care, The Throne must truckle under Papal Chair. Kings can't do wrong, so does the maxim say, But Ministers of State, their servants, may. Tho Kings themselves do sit above the Law, Justice still keeps their Ministers in awe; For if they do not make the Law their guide, Great as they are, by Law they may be try'd; Else we should subject be to every ill, And be made slaves to Arbitrary will. O happy Isle where each man Justice craves! Kings can't be Tyrants, nor the subjects slaves. The Laws some great ones fear, who rule the State; When they can't new unto their wills create, They to their minds, with Cunning, try to mold, And, with new Images, to stamp the old: What 'gainst Dissenting Papists first was ben, For Protestants now proves a Punishment. Law, Law they Cry, and then their Brother smite, As well upon the left side as the right: To every Jayl the Protestants they draw, And Persecution still is masqu'd with Law: We do not know but Rome may have its turn, And then it will be also Law to burn. This is not all, for some ill men there be, Who would the Laws use in a worse degree: Treason and Traytors, Plots against the State, To reach their Foes, they cunningly create: To Prison then the Innocent they draw, And if they could their Heads would take by Law; But Law is just, and English-men are good, And do not love to dip their hands in Blood Of Innocents: But this has rais'd the Rage Of some Politick Actors on our Stage, And spite of Justice, Law, and Reason too, Their wicked ends by other means pursue. Those men, whom they can neither hang nor draw, Freed by their Country, Justice, and the Law, They try to Murther with an Hirelings Pen, By making them the very worst of men. They 'ave Orators and Poets at their will, Who with their venom, strive their Fames to kill. These rack the Laws, and holy Scriptures too, And fain would make all the old Treasons new: They will not let the Graves and Tombs alone, But Conjure up the Ghost of Fourty One. With this they try the ignorant to scare, For men are apt the worst of things to fear, Tho that Ghost is no liker Eighty two, Than a good Christian like a Turk or Jew: London, the happy Bulwork of our Isle, No smooth and oyly words can thee beguile: Thou knowst thy Int'rest, that will never lye; Eternal as thy self, the men do die. 'Tis Truth and Justice that do thee uphold, And richer in Religion than in Gold; Thy Piety has built thy Turrets higher Than e're; in spite of Plague, of War, and Fire. Without a sigh we can't think on the flame, Nor by what hands, and from what heads it came. With envious Eyes they do thy riches view, When old ways fail, to spoil thee they find new: No Art's untry'd which may thy Coffers drain, For which the subtil Lawyer racks his Brain: Thy too old Charters they will new Arraign. Thou must not think thou canst in safety stand, Whilst the false Canaanite swarms in the Land. Some State-Physicians cry, that thou art sick, And on thee they would try some quacking trick: As yet their poysonous drugs thou dost not need, Nor does thy Body want to purge or bleed. Thy Head we hope with Loyalty is Crown'd, Thy Heart and Intrails we do know are found: Thy hands are open, honest, free, and strait, And all thy Members plyable and neat; All think you well in Health, and sound within, Tho some few spots appear upon your skin, They're but the purgings of the sounder part, And are at a great distance from the Heart. The wealthy love to thrive the surest way, For gain perhaps they will like slaves obey, Give up their Charters, bend their necks, now free, To servile yoaks, and stoop to that degree, As to submit to Romes Curst Tyranny. But sure the wise, and the Religious too, Will all the just and lawfull ways pursue, To keep that freedom unto which they're born, And which so well doth English men adorn; Which our Forefathers did preserve with care, And which we, next our souls, do hold most dear. Let the hot Tories, and their Poet Curse, They spend in vain, and you are ne'r the worse. Alas! they seem us only made to damn, And then curse most when they have lost their sham; They are true Shimies, or the sons of Cham. Their Mouths are open Sepulchers, their Tongue With venom full is ever speaking wrong: With Oaths and Cursings, and with looking big, They seek to fright some harmless peiceful Whig; Then boast the Conquest, Hector, rant and tear, And cry God dam'um Protestants they are: All the Phanaticks are a cursed Crew, Worse than the Papists, or the Moor, or Jew: The City is a Laystale full of mire, And ought again to be new purg'd with fire: All honesty, all godliness they hate, Love strife and War, contention and debate, These are the men from whom much mischief springs, Whilst their bad cause, they falsly make the Kings; These wrong the King, and then to make amends, With Oaths declare they are his only friends: But these are they, who Coleman would out do, Blow up both Kings and Kingly Power too. For why is all this Contest, and this strife? This strugling in the State, as 'twere for Life? VVhen all men own'd their enjoy'd happiness, And dayly did their belov'd Monarch bless? But these ill Men all common Roads forsake, O're Hedges, and th' row standing Corn they break; Though ill success they have, they will not cease, Till they have spoyl'd the Nations happy peace. They see none to Rebellion are inclin'd, Yet Plots they make, where Plots they cannot find. But their Designs they did so idly frame, The Evil on their Heads return'd with shame; And though they find their Evil Projects Curst, They keep the Impudence they had at first: 'Gainst Honesty, Law, Reason, then they fight, And falsely cry, The King can have no right. The People of their Judgment they'd bereave, No proof, no Circumstance will they believe: Rebels and Traytors they will still Create, And are Men-Catchers of the highest rate. With Regal Rights these Men keep much adoe; But, with that Stale, their own game they pursue: Their Monarchs Safety, Honour, Fame, Renown, The great Supports, and Jewels of the Crown; The Peoples Love, their Freedom, Liberties, Those they neglect, and these they do despise. What ere these Men pretend, the jugling feat Is plainly seen; 'tis to grow Rich, and Great, To Rule, to Sway, to Govern as they please: The Peoples Grievance, and the Lands Disease. All men that would oppose their pow'r and sway, And will not them, like Galley-slaves, obey, They brand with odious Names, although they spring From Fathers ever Loyal to their King: Though they themselves Sons of the Church are known, Would with their Blood defend their Monarchs Throne, And ready are their Lives to sacrifise For all their King's just Rights, which much they prize. But O the Change that's now in England seen, They who are Loyal, and so e're have been, Because they will not serve sinister ends, Are Rebels call'd, at least call'd Traitors Friends. Thou wicked Hag, that now art arm'd with power, That wouldst Mens Souls and Bodies both devour, That now dost show thy bloody armed paws, With Malice arm'd, and with too rigid Laws; With what Poetick Curse shall I thee paint, Who art a Devil, yet appear'st a Saint? But Vengeance for thee still in Heav'n there's store, Though many Bless, and Thee the Beast adore, Thou'rt dy'd with Blood, and art the Scarlet Whore. O Persecution! thou'rt a Goddess blind, That never sparest any humane kind; In every Country thou dost footing gain, In all Religions thou desir'st to Reign, But never wast admitted in the True. Hence grow our Tears, that here thou should'st renew Thy Strength and Power in this Happy Realm, Our Quiet, and our Peace to over-whelm; When for some years thou hast been banished, And Protestants believ'd thou hadst been dead; Or that at least, we never more should fear That thou shouldst live to shew thy Power here: Unless (which Heav'n avert) that thou shouldst come By force, brought in by the Curs'd Power of Rome. But griev'd we are, to see it in our Age, And fear it may a greater ill presage. Prisons and Fines the punishments are now, But who knows what at last it may come to? For this damn'd Hag longs still for Humane Food, Ne'r satisfied till she is gorg'd with Blood. Well may the Papists, when they have their turn, Rack and Imprison, Torture, Hang, and Burn; When Protestants to Protestants do shew, That had they Pow'r, themselves as much would do. But let the busie Ministers take care, They do but Vengeance for themselves prepare: For in all Ages it was ever known, That God his Vengeance on their Heads pour'd down. All but meer Fools may easily foresee What will the fatal end of these things be: If one bigotted in the Romish way, Should once again the English Scepter sway; Then those who in the Pulpit are so loud, Preaching Succession to the Vulgar Croud, Must change their Croaking Notes; their Coats must turn, Or, if prove Honest, fly the Land, or burn. Whom Benefit or Ignorance engage Now to the Party, then shall feel the Rage Of those fierce Tyrants, who now undermine, And hidden carry on their curst Design. The proud usurping Priest, and Popish Knaves, Shall be your Lords, and all the English Slaves; The Nobles then must wear the Romish yoak, Or Heads submit unto the fatal stroak. Oppression will grow bold, the Tadpole-Priests, Shall lift above the Lords, their Priestly Crests. T'attempt or struggle then will be in vain, For Persecution will a Tyrant Reign; Her fatal pow'r will then be understood, And she will glut her self with Martyrs Blood. The Popes Supremacy shall then be shown, No other Head in England will be known: Then shall a general Curse flow through the Land, Lord against Lord, Friend against Friend shall stand, Till at the last the Crowd, in their defence, Provok'd to Rage, Arm 'gainst their Popish Prince: With Words no longer, but with Arms they'll jar, And England will be spoyl'd with Civil War; True Peace and Happiness so long shall want, Till she shall get a Monarch Protestant. Thus Factious Men to Civil Broyls ingage, And with their ferment make the Crowd to rage: Their Madness, they in others would increase, Yet wipe their Mouths, and cry they are for Peace, For King, for Regal Rights, and true Succession, They in the peoples ears still make profession; Yet for one Man, such Friends they are, so civil, They'd send almost Three Nations to the Devil. But there's no way these Mischiefs to prevent, Unless we have an Healing Parliament: Of that these faulty Men love not to hear, They've much transgrest, and much they have to fear. Until that day, England will find no rest, Though now she slumbers on her Monarchs breast; But then the Nation will be truly blest. FINIS.</field>
