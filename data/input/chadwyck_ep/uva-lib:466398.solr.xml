      <field name="fulltext">HANNIBAL: A Poem. HANNIBAL ON THE ALPS. “Peace nevermore; but war, eternal war, 'Twixt Romans and the race of Hamilcar!” Thus, by the altar of his fatherland, With mystic ceremonial, laying hand Upon the bleeding victim, sternly swore The stripling of nine years; and in the core Of his deep soul he treasures up that oath, Till one great purpose, growing with his growth, Absorbs his very being, and the boy Becomes a man, devoted to destroy Th' oppressor of his race, and with her name Wipe out the memory of Punic shame. Twice nine years more have passed; behold him now Preparing to redeem that solemn vow, Collecting all his strength to meet the foe, And strike the long-premeditated blow: For Rome will never yield; who fights with her Must be her victim or her vanquisher. And he hath manned his fleet and swept the seas, Through slaughter waded to the Pyrenees, From Pyrenees to Alps; and nothing stops The course of the avenger; cliffs, whose tops Are in the clouds of heaven, he dares to scale: Easy the task may seem, and dull the tale To modern tourist's ear, who bravely vaunts His Alpine feats and pleasant summer jaunts Through the same region, civilised by time: For what was dreadful once is now sublime, Romantic, picturesque, or how besides You like to phrase it, led by Switzer guides To sights and scenes that ravish or entrance, Cloud-reaching roads from Italy and France, Or where the fur-clad Corsican, the god Of modern admiration, safely trod The rugged paths, and dragged his cannon down St. Bernard slopes, and won a cheap renown. But honour unto him who first essays Of peril unexplored the darksome ways. Well might the Carthaginian at the sight Of those strange barriers pause; height over height, Like ramparts raised by nature to repel Invasion, and the boldest hopes to quell, Interminable rising; ridge from ridge Parted by dizzy chasms, that none could bridge Save the strong-pinioned eagle; jagged steeps, From which the fiercely-foaming torrent leaps Or rolls the avalanche. No pastime this, To march in terror of the huge abyss That yawns beneath, upon some narrow ledge Of slippery rock, or on the cataract's edge, While grisly natives, who defy pursuit, Hang threatening on the height, and hurl or shoot Their savage missilery; and then to bear, Unhoused, unsheltered, all that sky and air Can pitilessly inflict, the piercing winds, The hail that buffets, and the mist that blinds; Roads lost in darkness, or by storms effaced, Still to be cut and cleared, retrieved, retraced, For beast and baggage, over deep defiles And swampy hollows, wrecks of mountain, piles Of hurricano-driven snow, that freeze Under a summer-sky. Amidst all these, Though many a brave one for the wolf and kite Be left a prey, without a funeral rite, Without a turf to mark a soldier's grave, The banners of imperial Carthage wave; And men are gathered round, of matchless might, In courage dauntless, terrible in fight; A semi-barbarous and motley host, Of many a tribe and tongue, from many a coast; Faith in their bold commander is the spell Their union, their devotion, to compel, Him following, like bloodhounds, in the lure Of carnage and of rapine: quivered Moor, And Balearian slinger; sons of Spain, From Gades and the far Atlantic main Or Celtiberian hills, in tunics gay Of snowy-white and scarlet; and th' array Of subject Libyans, from the broad frontiers Of Carthage, with their long and glittering spears; And Punic lords, the blood of ancient Tyre, With dark and haughty brows and eyes of fire; The plumy-crested Nomad, and his steed, Child of the sandy wilderness, whose speed Shall not avail him here: the elephant Hath shared his master's toil; with forage scant, With painful burdens laden, numbed and pinched With cold and hunger, never hath he flinched From duty; pattern of the discipline That trains a soldier: such is Heaven's design, That muscle, nerve, and strength shall be the tools Of thought, that safely guides and wisely rules. See now upon a table-summit spread Their weather-torn pavilions: night hath fled, And saffron tints of morning streak the skies; Thick vapours steaming from the valley rise, And cliff and crag are wrapt with silvery haze, Until the sun breaks forth, with sudden blaze Flooding the mountain tops; the mists unfold Their snowy wreaths and turn to clouds of gold, Ascending yet, till with the burning ray They mingle and are melted into day. Peaks, precipices, glens, and clefts appear, And all the Alpine region far and near; Beneath it and beyond it, far away As eye could reach, a glorious prospect lay, Extended like a picture to the view, More beautiful than artist ever drew, Or poets of Elysian landscapes feign; A country formed for a Saturnian reign Of happiness; not yet with cities crowned, Or stately towers and battlements, that frowned On vassal people learning to forget Their nation and their sires; nor knew it yet The name of province. The unconquered Celt In the rude freedom of his fathers dwelt; No other bulwark than the sword he prized, And art he understood not or despised; His tillage, like his life, was rough and plain; Earth yielded what he asked with little pain. 'Twas Nature of her lavish bounty made That lovely garden, clothing field and glade With sweetest verdure, pouring from the hills The rich abundance of their floods and rills, Breathing the airs that wake ambrosial spring, And teach the earth to flower, the bird to sing: For these are Nature's, God's; the harmony Of earth with heaven above; the soft blue sky Seen in the mirror-lake; the dewy lawn Glistering in the flush of crimson dawn; Th' unclouded sun, of his meridian march When he has climbed the zenith, from his arch Of glory looking down, beheld by men In brightness only, as to mortal ken A glimpse of the Creator is revealed Throughout His glorious works. Were man not steeled By custom of ill deeds, and thoughts yet worse Enthralling his degenerate soul, the curse Of sin primeval, in this garden grove, In this delicious clime, were scenes to move High thoughts and holy rapture, that might charm Barbarian bosoms, and their rage disarm. Gazing awhile they stood with strange delight Upon the boundless panorama, bright With autumn's dædal hues, and wonder mute Held them, as they surveyed each speck minute Of life and motion, every field and tree Visible in the clear transparency, Green hillocks dotted o'er with nibbling flocks, And shepherd boy, and ploughman with his ox Cleaving the fallow glebe, and straying herds, And twinkling of innumerable birds That skim along the meads or upward soar, And lonely fisher paddling with his oar, Hamlets and rural cots, the homes of toil, Remote from cares of war and foreign broil. All in the centre of the valley flows The king of rivers, fed with Alpine snows, Eridanus, at first with fond delay Wooing his banks and winding on his way; And now the champaign threads, now peeps thro' green Embowering shades or opening hills between; Now by Taurinian woods his path is crost, And in their covert dense the flood is lost; But soon again he hastens to emerge With broader channel and with bolder surge, Swelled by a thousand tributary streams, His waters dancing in the sunny beams, Exulting in his strength he rolls along, The source of plenty and the theme of song. 'Twas Italy! they cried; and quickly ran From tent to tent the word, from man to man; And they had gazed their fill, and Hannibal Stept forth into the midst, and round them all Triumphantly he looked, and speech that raised Their highest hopes began: “The gods be praised! Ye see before your eyes the promised land, Prize for the valiant heart and conquering hand. This Italy, the land of corn and oil And blushing vineyards, ye shall seize and spoil; Yet not these nearest vales that lie below; Here dwells no Roman, but the Roman's foe, Our friend and our ally, the stubborn Gaul, Whose armies soon shall muster at our call. Yonder upon your right ye see a sheet Of glassy splendour, stretching till it meet The heaven's blue concave; 'tis the Libyan sea, That once was ours, and ours again shall be, When Rome hath fallen. Those highlands dark with pine Are offbreaks of the ridgy Apennine, The backbone of Italia; thither now Our march is. South and eastward from the brow Of that blue mountain pours th' Etrurian flood, Which the fell Romans drink, the hateful brood Of ravenous wolves, whom to their lair we'll hunt, And smite and slay them till our swords are blunt With slaughter: to the gods we'll give their lives; But yours shall be their daughters and their wives, Raiment and jewels, gold and silver hoards, Delicious wines that sparkle on their boards, Their horses and their flocks and rich domains, The plunder of their houses and their fanes, And stores of armour—all shall be for you; Only, my comrades, to yourselves be true. ‘Onward’ be still the word! the deeds ye've done Are earnest of new trophies to be won. Alps, glaciers, frost, and famine—these are past; Remains the easiest conquest and the last, To win this sunny land, and end the sway Of robber-tribes, whom only slaves obey. Then come, my comrades, to the plain descend; There is your guerdon, there your labour's end!” He said; and martial valour at his words Was kindled into flame, and shields and swords Were clashed, and from the dissonant voices broke A shout of acclamation, that awoke Echoes on echoes rolling, till it seemed The mountain's thunder-cry; the eagle screamed, As if some new Enceladus had blown His war-blast, the Olympian to dethrone. Anon, at sound of trumpet, all the camp Was busy with departure and the stamp Of mustering files and squadrons; full of hopes, And with requickened vigour, down the slopes That overhang Hesperia they commence Their easier march descending. “What and whence Be these new-comers?” of each other ask Cisalpine shepherds, pausing in their task To gaze upon the mighty stream of war. No huntsmen of their kindred: from the far Crest of the mountain to the vale below Stretches the long battalia, with brave show Of military splendour; lance and plume And flaming banners all the path illume: Th' advancing columns opening into ranks Halt on the spacious field, and soon, their flanks On each side deepening, to the view present Centre and wing and squared regiment In battailous array. Before the van Conspicuous rides the lordly African, Leader of all the host; with earnest gaze Their number and their order he surveys, Then looks upon the mountains left behind, His heart with pride distending, in his mind Already victor: for what feat were hard To these the much-enduring, who had warred With greater power than mortal, had assailed The fortresses of Nature, and prevailed Over the very elements? “We come, Avengers of our wrongs, accursed Rome, To sweep thee from the earth!” What human force Can meet the deluge, or resist its course? INVASION OF ITALY. Unbar thy temple, Janus; open wide The sounding portals; let the fiends that bide Thine awful summons loose, to carry scath And havoc o'er the earth. Arouse thy wrath, Bellona; Mars, assert thine ancient reign; Let not the stranger's foot thy soil profane. Already the Romulean eagles fly, To scare the vultures who their power defy: Rome is abroad in arms: she scorns to wait Till the insulting foe is at her gate, But while he lingers yet in doubt or fear, Her loud alarum breaks upon his ear, Her battle bristling on the trenched field Forbids retreat, and he must fight or yield. And now her flower of knightly equipage And mail-clad cohorts breathing martial rage Up from Ligurian vallies fast she pours; Padus beholds them from his frighted shores; And sleep'st thou, Hannibal? or wherefore lags The front of bold invasion? and those flags, That streamed erewhile so brilliant and so gay, Flouting the Alpine breezes, where be they? Hark, hark, upon Ticino's verdant marge A whirlwind rush of steeds! Charge, Romans, charge; Around your flanks the fell Numidians swarm; Upon them, gallants, and disperse the storm! A Scipio leads you—Scipio—name renowned, Woful to Carthage, at whose very sound Hereafter shall the maiden's cheek turn pale, And orphan boys and widowed mothers wail. But 'tis not he, of conquered Afric named, The chivalrous, the virtuous, the unblamed; Another is it now, who leads the brave To hasty combat and a dismal grave. What foul mischance the valiant chief betrays, His wisdom baffles, or his soul dismays? Did evil flight of birds his ardour check, Or did the moping fowl refuse to peck? Or the Etrurian soothsayer advise Of angry gods, or stinted sacrifice? A Scipio turns his back, and turn he must, His beaten horsemen weltering in the dust, Saving his noble life to be the prey Of Spanish vultures on a bloodier day. Beside Placentia's walls and Trebia's ford In vain hath rash Sempronius drawn the sword; Fortune again upon the stranger smiles, And Roman valour yields to Punic wiles. Gallia hath shared the glory and the spoil, And girds her now for longer, mightier toil: Clan against clan no more will she divide, Thanks to the star of victory, who shall guide Her fair-haired children, hungering as of old For Roman heads, for vengeance, and for gold. Over the Apennine the war comes down, And clouds begin to darken with their frown Hesperia's heaven, that must for many a year Oppress the land, and make an atmosphere Of dreariment and gloom, on every face Leaving and in each heart their ghastly trace. Sad were the tale of war, if told aright: In other fashion would the muse indite Her epic story, than with hackneyed phrase Of idol-worship, trumpeting the praise Of him she calls a hero, who can win Battle or empire, heeding not the sin; Knew she, as truth's high prophetess, the task Assigned her, to strip off the idol's mask, His fabulous disguise, and give mankind To view the hideous form that lurks behind; Of trophies we should hear, of triumphs less, Of horrors more, and crime and godlessness Afflicting realms and nations: we should read, How, not the armies, but the people bleed, Unwounded of the steel, yet stricken sore In soul and spirit, bleed at every pore Of that which is most vital. For how sad For fathers, brothers, sons, when ruffians mad With beastlike rage and passion hover near Their sanctuaries, threatening all that's dear And precious, all they honour and revere: How piteous for the land, where fiends, whose smile Is fury, make their lawless domicile, And round about imperiously stalk, Defying god or man their will to balk, Trampling upon her breast with iron heel And noise of earthquake, while her children reel In pain and anguish, or like spectres creep In silence, daring not their curses deep To mutter, or their scalding tears to weep. So shall the plague of war Hesperia smite, Travelling o'er the realm with bane and blight, Making a beaten road and thoroughfare Of desolation, laying waste and bare Her rich-clothed fields and vallies, withering Her fruitfulness and beauty, poisoning All sources of delight. The blasted woods Shall moan unto the hills; the crystal floods Disturbed, polluted, with an angry swell Uprising from their fountains, haste to tell Their sorrows to the sea: her vineyards reft Of human culture, to the wild-boar left And wallowing buffalo; her acres clean, With thistles blotched and overgrowth obscene, Shall look like fen or moorland; vintager And husbandman and sturdy forester To distant scenes removed, to other strife Than with the woods and glebes, the pruning-knife And rustic hatchet changed for sword and shield: And many a ploughman to the furrowed field That knew his boyish whistle, to the steers, His patient plodding comrades, must with tears Bid long adieu; and village maids be sent, For fear of worse, to dreary banishment, Far from their pleasant cots, their neat-trimmed lawns, From old Sylvanus and the neighbour Fauns, And bounteous Pan, and gentle Nymphs, to whom The lambs their sleekness owe, the flowers their bloom, No more to prank them for the lustral wake At spring's returning prime, nor merry-make In harvest-season, when the capering swain Thanks the earth-mother for her golden grain, When rosy apples strew the orchard-plats, And the sweet must is foaming in the vats, And spears are waving decked with ivy-twine, And masks of Liber swinging from the pine. These must be memories now, in desert wolds That screen their sudden flight, or in strongholds Amid the roar of camps and garrisons, Where they shall think of dear and absent ones, Of ancient haunts and dwellings, and contrast A cheerless present with a blissful past. The burgher, only safe within the pale Of walls and ramparts, like a shell-pent snail, Shall sit in lonely places ill at ease, Hearing the sound of battle in the breeze; And often mount his roof or turret high, Over the region of his fears to spy, And brakes and bushes warlike shape assume, And phantom armies in the distance loom: Perchance he cares not, for he scarce discerns His friends from foes; or in his heart there burns Hatred of all that ply the soldier's trade, And rather he would see in ashes laid Those walls and all their wide circumference, Than bear the rude and roistering insolence Of caitiff hirelings, licensed to obtrude On him and on his house their presence lewd, The treasures of his secret cells unhoard, Or snatch the scanty morsel from his board. Man's very nature will the time infect, His outward favour, tongue, and dialect: Fair courtesy her temper shall unlearn, And sparkling wit grow dull and taciturn; And laughter shall forget her merriment, And envy be no more a malcontent, But seek for her dark thoughts a new employ, Rejoicing in the general lack of joy: And love shall borrow hate's fierce qualities, Embittering her sweetest sympathies: Woman her lot of misery will unsex, To spousal and maternal ties annex Conditions cruel, curdling in her breast The milk of kindness: infants uncarest, Unnoticed, at the mother's foot will mope, Chid for their prattle and the glistening hope Seen in their eyes: nor wonder, when the looks Of husbands and of neighbours are as books Recording dismal tales, and daily life Is chronicled by grief, each moment rife With tidings of disaster, sights and sounds At which the glad heart sickens, grisly wounds And images of death, funereal pyres Shooting into the air their dusky fires That pale the sunbeam, and unearthly shrieks Of hireling beldams, sobs and haggard cheeks Of those that mourn in earnest. Use shall then Make trite and common to the eyes of men Things strange and monstrous, hideous and uncouth, Age furrowing the brow of placid youth, Striplings, but lately held on nursing laps, Caparisoned in steel to fill the gaps Of wasted armies, or keep watch and ward With slaves and crippled fugitives, to guard Their trembling Lares and paternal hearth; A dragon-crop of evil; want and dearth; Treason, that stabs a friend; domestic feud, Turning a home to worse than solitude; Revenge, as she inflicts her scorpion fang, Herself recoiling at the victim's pang; Bloodthirsty rage, of greed so ravenous, Enacting deeds too fell for Tartarus; Sports of the hangman and the torturer, Orgies of carnage, infant-massacre: Dire shall the anguish be, and loud the cries Of towns and cities to the cruel skies, Oft as in thunder-wrath the war-clouds sweep From north to south, from Adria's troubled deep To Rhegium's rock and blood-stained Syracuse, More dreadful than when Ætna's floods break loose Out of her raging womb, and from the wrack Of smoking villages and fiery track Of ruin a benighted people fly. War on the mountains, and no succour nigh! Can Umbrian hunters check the fierce career Of Gaulish inroad? on the Nomad spear Picenian peasants rush? Etruria, what Of thy proud state remains? hast thou forgot Ancestral virtue? sleeps it in the urns Of thy Mæonian kings? Voltumna turns A mournful look upon the ruined fane, Where sounded once the patriot's lofty strain, Now echoing to a foreign chief's harangue, His cymbals and barbaric trumpet-clang. Her voice no more the willing muster calls From Volaterræ and from Clusium's walls; Swept by Massylian horsemen she must see Ciminian glades and nymph-loved Fesulæ: But the Saturnian queen will not forsake The tombs of Veii aud the Alban lake; Rome will assist her handmaid; her who gave Arts, policy, religion, she will save: A Gallic tumult threatens; in that word Are centuries of triumph; it hath stirred Her people's mighty heart; Flaminius, flushed With youthful glory, lion-like hath rushed To meet the hunter; lion-like, but blind, Into the toils he plunges, and shall find A Caudium there, the goal of his renown. He nevermore in palmy-broidered gown Shall mount the car of victory, ne'er again Up to the seat of Jove with captive train And bloody spoils and glittering pomp ascend: Amaze and panic on his march attend; Avenging Gallia smites him where he weens To reap victorious bays; in Thrasymene's Cold valley gashed by many a wound he lies, And pitying foes perform his obsequies. CANNÆ. Woe to the martial race, but not despair: What folly loses, wisdom can repair: The stern dictator lifts his awful rods, With novel rites propitiates the gods, Fabius, the shield of Rome, whose sheltering power Sustains his country in her trying hour, And gains a breathing time, till strength revive And they that gasp for life for conquest strive. On for another field! no more delays! Apulian plains and Samnian uplands blaze, And locust swarms are eating up the tilth Of fertile glebes, and riot in the spilth Of luscious vineyards. But a power's on foot, Shall find them other welcome, and make boot Of them and of their gatherings: Latium's realm Sends forth her myriads, force enough to whelm All Carthage under sea, (beneath their tread Shake the Campanian hills), and at their head The consuls, girded with their country's pride, Her chosen champions, worthy to decide The world's great empire. To the field they come, To see and conquer: the prætorium Hangs out its bloody challenge to the lists, Where the opposed camps thro' rising mists Each by the other dimly are descried, And men like airy sprites are pouring wide Over the dusky plain, and trumpets chide The tardy morn-god clamouring while he parts The envious clouds, and over Adria darts His horizontal beams upon the face Of battle; that soon grows in lessening space More dreadful, and the field is all aglow With noise and dust, and speeding to and fro Of message and command, and marshalling Of rank and file, and horsemen on the wing, And trooping of light-armed with dart and sling, And hawk-eyed archers notching to the string Their flight of feathered arrows, to prelude The sterner shock of arms; whose skirmish rude Affrights the welkin; thick as winter hail Rattles the stormy shot on plate and mail; Until the sun-bright standards in advance Display the ordered squadrons, steed and lance Panting for onslaught, and the heavy bands Of infantry, with yet unpurpled hands Wielding their various implements of death; The Roman slow of pace, and holding breath, The savage foe's demeanour to peruse, The Celt, half-naked in his plaid and trews, And snowy-frocked Iberian at his side, With hideous yells approaching, their long stride Quickening to a run, in moony curve Pushing their medley war. Now every nerve And sinew must be strained; front threatens front No more at distance; in the deadly brunt Of conflict men with men and steeds with steeds Are mingling, each and all on valorous deeds Intent, as it were sport to hack and hew The limbs of adversaries, and undo The fairest work of nature. Swings from high The Gallic broadsword, like the battery Of some Cyclopian hammer, on the row Of serried opposites, blow after blow Redoubling oft and oft, with lightning flash And terror and intolerable crash Of helm and shield and cuirass: nor with zeal Less fiery brandishes his trenchant steel The shorter-sworded Spaniard, nor less haste Impels the barbed pilum hot to taste Barbarian blood: but deeper is the bite Of the keen gladius plunging in the fight; And hugest strength and stature are at fault, Ill-trained and ill-equipt, against th' assault Of Rome's embattled legions, skilled alike To cut, to thrust, to parry, and to strike, For dextrous movement or for bold exploit, Calm or impetuous, daring or adroit, In soldier-craft and panoply secure, That make the battle safe, the victory sure: Now all too rash, as to an easy prey, They press into the yielding disarray, Yielding, yet step by step, against the throng And weight of numbers labouring to prolong Unequal fight. Ill fares it with the best By multitudes and mighty danger prest, But for a faith that peril can outdare, Faith in their comrades and their leader's care, His omnipresent eye and prescient soul To guide their valour and the field control. On press those legions; but their wild turmoil Shall soon be quelled, their headlong rush recoil; Another foe is nigh; on either wing The cheers of Carthaginian onset ring; Pours on their naked flanks the steely rain, The fire-eyed sons of Libya rush amain To reap their gory harvest, and, like grass Under the sweating scythe, the crowded mass Are dropping fast by weapons once their own; Not with impunity; an angry groan Hath burst from Latium's heart, her shifting files Confront the peril, and amid the piles Of carnage Punic veins with Roman stream: Nor burn not Spain and Gallia to redeem Their battle-ground, encouraged and refresht At sight of rallying fortune: Rome enmesht In evil strait—as when a yelling pack Are gathering with fangs and fierce attack Around a herd of deer, nor room nor play Leave for their noble rage—so stands at bay The baffled strength of Rome, and sees no cure For sad confusion and discomfiture; For lo, upon her rear—'twas this made blank The boldest countenance—from yonder bank, Where Latium's mounted chivalry have bled And Aufidus is choked with floating dead, Victorious Asdrubal, whose hest to-day, To smite and spare not, none will disobey, Breaks with his thundering horsemen. As when roll The chafing waves against a rocky mole, Built up with strong foundations to defend Some famous harbour; and awhile they spend Their shivered strength in vain; yet never cease Returning and returning with increase Of noise and anger, till the deep immense Seems to rise up in her omnipotence To hurl th' obstruction down, and like a heap Of loosening sand it falls; the billows leap Over the crumbling ruin, and with roar Of exultation burst upon the shore. Intrepid chiefs and warriors, who contemned All but your own high thoughts, ye have not stemmed Misfortune's tide; your rampart of firm breasts Is pierced and broken, vailed the crimson crests That towering o'er the field defiance waved; Your pomp of battle trodden down, outbraved Your haughty menaces. Too poor, too faint Are words, the frightful images to paint Of the lost battle, when the strong and swift Are swept with weak and wounded in the drift Of universal ruin, and the base Linked to the brave in slaughter's foul embrace; The blood-drunk victor and his reeking blade Over the dying throw their ghastly shade, And the last sounds that reach the swooning brain Are the demoniac shouts that mock his pain. 'Tis done: that host—it seems but yester morn, Since youth of Latium, high and lowly born, Patrician and plebeian, one and all Answering gaily to their country's call, Flocked to the muster; it was honour's road And duty's; every maniple o'erflowed With numbers and with strength; the veriest boor, That left his goats or swine on cliff or moor, Had with his helmet donned a soldier's grace, And strutted to the town with buoyant pace; Their sacraments of liegeance thro' the crowd In quick succession were intoned aloud, And the brave standards soaring to the sky Became as gods of their idolatry; Grave fathers sent them forth with prayer and vows, And ardent maids twined garlands for their brows. Hope dawned upon their march, and glory shone; A single blast of war, and they are gone, Like the brief pageant of a shifting scene, Passed quite away, as they had never been: And Hannibal may traverse Cannæ's plain, And gaze upon the wreck and count the slain, And note their riven arms and bosoms trenched With gashes, many clenching, as they clenched In the last moment of approaching doom, Their trusty swords, and cheeks where valour's bloom Is lingering, as death were but a trance, To animate the marble countenance; Mark the gay plumes and tunics richly dight, The stripes and rings of senator and knight, And where the consul fell, his gallant heart Playing the soldier's not the leader's part, Quitting him like a Roman and the heir Of a time-honoured name: Æmilius there Rests in his iron sleep; nor consulate Nor lictors, venomed slander, factious hate, Nor wrangling tribunes nor comitium's brawl, Nor sound of Punic trump or shouting Gaul Shall ever rouse him more. “The hour is come”— Cries iron-souled Maharbal—“on for Rome! While she is cowering naked of defence, Strike, hurl her to perdition! I will hence This moment with the horse, and follow thou With thy battalions; in four days from now We'll sup i'th' Capitol.” Such counsel bold, Persuading not the chief, hath story scrolled For sciolist and schoolman to perplex Their little brains withal; and sure 'twould vex The shade of the great captain, could he hear From those grave oracles the truth severe, How from his side dame fortune he estranged, Spurning her proffered favour, which had changed The destiny of nations! Vain and slight Babblers; who know not, that to mortal sight Of the dark future is revealed no more, Than serves a doubtful pathway to explore From day to day thro' life's entangled maze; That this is wisdom's office, this her praise, Promptly and well permitted means to use, Of chances, possibilities, to choose What likeliest seems and best; and if she err, Thereof a higher will is arbiter: Hers be the counsel, the device, the plan, The end is God's, unchangeable by man: Then say we, bold endeavour, strenuous thought, In honour's catalogue shall pass for nought? No; still in their desert let faith be strong; Success or failure makes not right or wrong. A prophet of no mighty foresight he, Who teaches of a past futurity, When ages o'er the issue have revolved And time itself the mystery hath solved; And his a crazy lore, that would pretend The work of ruling providence to mend, Imaginary destinies to build, And abrogate the book of fate fulfilled. ROME. Who shall describe the agony, the tears, When Cannæ's tale was shrieked in Roman ears, As minute after minute posting came With news of orphaned child and widowed dame, And blasted hopes and houses desolate? The aged father groaning under weight Of anguish, and the mother's louder plaint, Are soon benumbed and silenced by constraint Of direr fears, or reckless of relief, The private sinking in the general grief: Pity hath lost her office to condole, When over all alike the sable stole And melancholy cypress cast their gloom. Like a dead city, like an empty tomb Of her lost children, such to outward show Was Rome in her extremity of woe; Yet who could look more nearly had beheld A living soul, an energy unquelled, Daring the worst of fortune to defy, And nobly wrestle with calamity. Oft on a vessel by the tempest tost Have landsmen looked from shore and deemed her lost, As she were nothing more than planks and masts Given to be mockery of the waves and blasts; But they that made the life of that frail bark Were still within her, and thro' dangers dark Saw light and hope and safety. Dauntless thus In spirit are the sons of Romulus, Steering the helm of state; the self same breed As they who to their country's utmost need Were ne'er found wanting, whether to eject Proud tyrant or decemvir, and protect From the invasion of imperious lust The sanctities committed to their trust By chaste-eyed Juno; whether to unclasp The bondsman's chain and loosen usury's grasp, That squeezes out the life of suffering toil; Or arts of wily demagogues to foil, And blustering insurrection overawe, Wielding the sacred majesty of law; Still labouring to preserve a nation's charge, And freedom's bounds with prudence to enlarge, Yielding of envied privilege whate'er The many with the few might safely share, What force would take disdaining to forego, What justice asked persuaded to bestow. Such was the race in ancient maxims reared, Men wise in counsel and in battle feared; He whom a virtuous poverty made fit The plough for the dictatorship to quit, And they who for their country's glory sealed Their pact with Hades upon Cremera's field: Crime was it then in duty to be lax, Sires gave rebellious children to the axe; The edge of justice sharpest, when offence The lustre soiled of high preeminence; For each man to the commonwealth belonged, And her, himself dishonouring, he wronged. Illustrious heroes, sacred in their dust! Stern Brutus and Publicola the just! Cossi, Camilli, and the Decian clan! Are they not household names to every man That calls himself a Roman? Age to age Their titles of renown, a heritage Richer than mines of richest gold, bequeaths; The very air of Rome their virtue breathes; No spot in the wide city but recalls Their mighty presence. In her council halls They sat like gods, commissioned from above To teach the mandates of eternal Jove; Their eloquence, in Grecian art unschooled. The passions of the maddening forum ruled; Th' applauding shouts that from the Campus rise, A nation's homage to her good and wise, Unsought for and uncoveted were theirs; Fasces and purple robes and curule chairs, The splendid gauds for which ambition sues, Were nought but idle pageants to amuse Or awe the vulgar, did not memories Of the departed great, whose dignities They waited on and served, around them flit In shadowy portraiture, by glory lit, More life-like than the Parian marble's form Or tablets with Ionian colours warm, Showing the heroes of the olden time, Such as in story and in patriot rhyme Immortalised they live. The simple lays, To which the minstrel hath attuned their praise, Are words of flame, that kindle bard and seer, The sacrifice exalt, the banquet cheer, Round the camp-fires and at the cradle sung; E'en infants from the babbling nurse's tongue Imbibe the arts that made their fathers great, And grow in the religion of the state. Thus nurtured were the peers, whose high debate An embassy of wretched captives wait, While mobs with loud impatience and uproar Besiege their counsels, clamouring to restore Sons, friends, and kindred, ruder voices blent With woman's tearful prayer and shrill lament; For Hannibal is gracious, armistice And ransom offering, and what terms suffice For vanquished men. O heavens! among these peers Are some who can remember—fifty years Have not effaced the day—upon this floor The censor Appius—carried to the door Infirm upon a litter—yet he came Impatient to unload his grief and shame, Forbidding ignominious peace uncrowned By victory: there he stood, and casting round In impotence his sightless eyeballs—“Peace! Peace with Tarentum and the slaves of Greece, Led by a petty tyrant, yet unchased From our domain, and threatening to lay waste The fields of Latium! you that would have stript The east's great conqueror of his plumage, clipt The eagle wings of Philip's mighty son, And scourged him o'er the seas to Macedon! So ye have boasted oft in merry fit Round the convivial board. And here ye sit, Tongue-doughty statesmen—oh, had heaven bereaved My hearing, as my sight, ere thus have grieved Mine aged ears!—here sit ye, chaffering For base conditions with an upstart king, A beggarly Molossian, fugitive From his rebellious subjects, come to live By plunder of your coasts. 'Twas not for this That Manlius hurled from your acropolis His huge assailants; not for this ye broke The free-born Samnite, and the Caudine yoke Twice, thrice avenged, and on your pillars hung His golden shields. So long will ye have clung To fortitude and honour, held so fast Unto the saving anchors of the past, And from their moorings will ye cast yourselves Ye know not whither, drifting upon shelves And quicksands? out of heart for one reverse, Fault of your general? as could aught worse Befall you, than the rumour noised abroad, That whoso lists may pillage and maraud, And trample on the soil of Italy, And fright her cities with impunity; Than insults of the Greeks, in all their ports And shouting theatres, at shows and sports, Making the butt of ribaldry and scorn Who dares confess himself a Roman born? Peace with Tarentum! never, till she deign A legion at her cost to entertain, 'Stead of an envoy; till she wash the dirt Cast on your sacred gown in streams that spurt Out of her guilty veins! Capitulate! With Pyrrhus? never may the sun create So foul a day, our calendar to blot! No, conscript fathers: rather on the spot Perish we all, like those old senators Who gave their breasts to Allia's conquerors! Of meaner things I speak not: talk who likes Of castled elephants and bristling pikes: Arm ye with Roman virtue, and full soon The staves of the Epirot shall be hewn In splinters, and the snaky-handed beasts, Stricken like hunted buffaloes, make feasts For kites and vultures of the Apennines.” So the old censor spake, and in long lines The senators upstood, with loud acclaim Unanimous for war, and on the name Of Appius, Appius called, and led him forth With filial reverence. O priceless worth, O wondrous power of godlike eloquence! Not that with honey flow to charm the sense; Not that where parrot lips are taught to range O'er themes to which the life and heart are strange, Or hypocrites pretend for truth to plead, Whose acts disown her and belie her creed; But where faith, reason, passion, all conspire To kindle on the tongue a generous fire, Whose lightnings pierce their way, whose thunders roll, To clear the turbid thought and wake the soul! Such voice the courage of Atilius found, Yet in the senate's ear his words resound, And royally in their hearts his memory reigns, Who stood before them pleading for his chains, A willing bondsman, freer than the free, Exampling in himself what Rome should be, And o'er his captors, when their grace he spurned, A triumph greater than by victory earned, Refusing to redeem the forfeiture Of all that's dearest, choosing to endure Bonds, exile, torture, rather than degrade The war-god's sceptre, and make peddling trade Of that high service and allegiance, His nation's birthright and inheritance, That spite of fortune's malice should exalt The seven-hilled city higher than the vault Of Jove's own mansion. “Gods! I would abhor Your very name and race, if glorious war Ye turned into a traffic and a job Of sordid huckstering, and did ye rob The soldier of his pride and noble aim, To be a partner in his country's fame. Find me the man who holds his honour cheap, 'Twere better for him in the dust to creep And grovel as a worm, than gird his loins To do your drudgery, for paltry coins Selling his sweat and blood. From service mean Expect not lofty deeds. Let Carthage lean On faithless hirelings: ours be to command True hearts, that battle for their fatherland, Tempered like hornets when the foe is near, Rushing on danger, ignorant of fear; Such, and such only. Shall your ranks be filled With wretched thralls, who Punic lands have tilled? Will recreants, who have felt the pinching gyves, Crouched to the lash and trembled for their lives, Be brave hereafter, and their fears forget? Aye, brave as birds that 'scape the fowler's net. Resign them to their lords, and me to share The servile doom, who led them into snare. The chance of battle? then a chance to make Or mar the player, life or death the stake. We hazard for the prize, and if we lose, Then shall we murmur and the gods accuse, And, while our misadventure we bemoan, Cast on the state a loss that is our own? Beshrew the mercy, that could find no place To hide my head and cover my disgrace, That to the commonwealth would fain restore A rank disease, to fester at her core. Hence with unmanly grief: 'twere heavy cost For miserable tears, an empire lost. The angry gods demand me, and I go A willing victim to the shades below. Hear my last words, and give them faithful heed: The blood of my devotion is the seed Of victory; from my ashes it shall spring, And shooting into life and flourishing O'ershadow all the earth. Then, Rome, forgive Thy hapless son, who dared to overlive Disaster, only then, when he hath shown How dying for his crime he can atone.” Frowning he ended, freezing into stone Their pity and their tears. So Rome gave up Her chieftain unredeemed, to drink the cup Of bitter sorrow; and she mourned for him, Not with black vestments, but with purpose grim Of promised vengeance; and she wept, no flood Raining from watery eyes, but tears of blood That dyed the ocean: and a monument She raised unto him, not of stonework, pent In narrow closure, but one vague and vast As her own rising greatness, and to last Unto the end of time. And so forlorn And abject is she now, that breath of scorn Finds not instinctive utterance, to rebuke Submissive counsels, craven thoughts, that brook To lend them patient ear? Shall Appius, Shall Regulus, Duilius, Catulus, Have lived, toiled, suffered, conquered, all in vain? Better in urns forgotten they had lain, Than Rome should from her lofty state bow down, And turn a renegade to her renown. Amid suspense, while waverers hold aloof, Of frailty conscious, dreading the reproof, As trees, before the storm begins to rouse, Bend neither way, but tremble in their boughs, Torquatus hath arisen; his flushing cheek, His flashing eye, the burning thought bespeak, And half his way into their hearts is made; And he harangues, and rallies to his aid What elements survive of true and leal, The old in creed and faith, the young in zeal: Whose impulse—'tis the country's—it is she, Roused like a giant from her lethargy! Debate is ended; weak or piteous plea Is put to silence by her stern decree: “Captives, receive your doom, the doom ye chose, When, arms in hand, ye gave them to the foes: Theirs ye became and are, to whom ye sold Your honour, irredeemable by gold. And why should we redeem a willing slave? What profits it a coward's life to save? Again that on the battle's awful brink Back on itself his feeble heart may shrink, His rotten breath upon the camp be shed, And through our ranks the dire infection spread? 'Tis men uphold the state, (of these good store The gods have left us, and we ask no more), Men, whom the braying trumpets more delight Than lamps of Hymen on their bridal night; Men, who have hands to fight, not feet to fly, For none can conquer, save who dare to die.” Back to thy lord; this arrow from his bow Hath sped but ill, Sidonian Carthalo; Back with thy slaves; and say the she-wolf's brood Thou found'st not in their den in parleying mood, But he must gather all his hunting gear, The game that he hath roused will cost him dear To catch or kill; the chase he hath begun May gall the hunter, ere the sport be done. And now from Cannæ's field the plume-pluckt chief In the humility of manly grief, Terentius, comes; and him his country's voice Thankfully hails, and bids him to rejoice, That he despaired not of the commonweal, Assured that time her ghastly wounds would heal, And that her pulse of life too briskly beat With undistempered blood and godborn heat, To lay her down and die. INSURRECTION OF SOUTH ITALY. Yet not the less Have signals travelled forth of her distress On rumour's thousand wings, whose noisy flight Hath shaken all Hesperia with affright. The sun of Rome hath suffered foul eclipse, And in the hearts of men and on their lips Are ominous forebodings; hopes and fears, Erewhile but faintly breathed in friendly ears, Venture to seek an echo, or provoke Contentious clamour by their raven croak: Italian burghers wan with public cares Assemble in their market-halls and squares, Like frighted sheep, or fowl that in their coops Huddle together when the falcon stoops; And each man on his neighbour looks agape, Fain from his own bewilderment to 'scape, Till whispered tidings break the dreadful pause, And cold distrust in earnest converse thaws; One tells his tale, one colours it anew, The false or wondrous adding to the true: Of prodigies they speak by hundreds seen, Of comets dropping fire but yestere'en, And raining showers of stone; two suns had dawned In the disordered sky, and graves had yawned And yielded up their dead, and oxen lowed With human voices, murmuring at the goad, (So by the country folk it was avouched;) Beasts of the forest in their stables couched, Two-headed births had scared the littering swine, And gory juices trickled from the vine; Th' incensed powers their worship had refused, Sweat from the statues and the altars oozed, And fanes were rent by lightning, and the fire On Vesta's hearth was suffered to expire In sullen ashes, whether 'twas the maid Had sunk in slumber and her charge betrayed, Or she whose breath the mystic embers fed From the devoted house in anger fled: And more than one grave elder from the notes Pencilled upon his boyish memory quotes A saying of some old Auruncan priest, Or oracle imported from the east, Or scroll of Sibyl, prophesying falls Of empires, tottering thrones, and funerals Of blazing cities: what can it portend But to usurping tyranny an end? So treason mutters, busy with her speech The secret heart of discontent to reach, And where the seeds of strife and mischief lurk There with the venom of her malice work, While throngs of satellites give noisy vent Unto the burden of her argument: A righteous heaven had looked on the opprest, Their prayers were heard, their wrongs would be redrest; A fratricidal race, by gods abhorred, Whose wealth was plunder and whose law the sword, Now by the sword should perish! Hark, what cries Thro' Italy resound? The nations rise; And first the rebel sword Apulia draws, And boldly links her to the conqueror's cause; Fierce hordes of Bruttians, like the wolves that prowl About their shaggy wildernesses, howl A chant of mutiny; and Samnium rears The banners of her hardy mountaineers, Their ancient quarrel once again to try And wrest from Rome her proud supremacy: Lucania too shall join her to the Greek, Their long arrears of enmity to wreak, And Croton's fickle people shall combine With Locrian false and feeble Tarentine: They come with mighty boast, the oft subdued, Forgetting a long age of servitude, Arpi, Salapia, Compsa, sworn to tame The Roman, and uproot the Latin name, Lessons of loss and chastisement unlearned, And centuries of olden time returned: Romans again must meet the battle-shock On their own ground, upon their native rock, Visions of might and majesty resign, Fight for their walls, for ancient Palatine, For Janus, for Quirinus; e'en as when The runaways of Alba to their den And robber-sanctuary were hunted down By vengeful Tatius; when the infant town Shook in her hilly cradle with alarms Of daily foes and din of neighbour arms, Sabine and Æquian and Etrurian With pillage and with terror overran Her tributary field, and petty states With tyrants in their train besieged her gates, Or exiled Marcius mocked the Roman sky With flaunting ensigns of Corioli, Till infants sued with tears and matrons knelt To soothe his anger and his pride to melt. CAPUA. What wild ambition Capua's bosom stirs? Freedom and fame and empire shall be hers: To violated faith a long farewell; Let Carthage lord it in her citadel. Ill-fated Capua, dearly she will rue, That e'er for such allies the sword she drew: Forlorn, forsaken, girt with dreadful siege, Too late will she confess the sacrilege: Now all is hopeful; eagerly she greets The welcomed victor in her halls and streets, And bids her senators and nobles clip Late dreaded foes in loving fellowship: Together met for worship, hand in hand Before the temple's marble porch they stand; The steps with palm-leaf and with flowers are strewn, The altars wreathed with many a gay festoon Of oak and ivy-spray, expect the rite That Capuan gods and Punic shall unite; The soothsayer attends in snow-white vest, And priests with linen hoods and vervain drest Bearing the fount and consecrated flame, While ivory flutes the festival proclaim; Young lords in shining tunics, fringed and laced With gold and silver, dangle from the waist In idle pomp their jasper-hilted glaives, And officers in ring with rods and staves Keep clearance, scarce withholding the unreined Impetuous multitude, whose eyes are strained To look on Cannæ's victor, there at length Standing among them, like a tower of strength To their bright city; there he stood, this Mars Of Africa, the echoes of whose wars Had rung from peaks of Atlas to the crest Of Alp and Apennine, at whose behest Winter threw down her barriers and made room To pass thro' her domain of night and gloom. Sickness and palsied age creep forth to see The champion who shall make Italia free; Women and children to the roofs have clomb; The sacrifice begins; a hecatomb Of faultless victims to the priestly knife In meek obedience yield their reeking life; The priest his morsels on the altar lays, And wine and incense mingle with the blaze, Whose savour, like the breath of secret prayer, Is wafted upward thro' the fields of air; Great Hannibal himself his tribute pours, And calls upon the gods whom he adores To witness mutual oaths, and sanctify Their solemn league with golden victory; Each lord repeats the lesson he hath conned, The people with a mighty shout respond, As prayers were mandates to the powers they sue, And fate itself their clamour could subdue. Meanwhile rough war enjoys a brief repose, The hospitable chalice freely flows; The Gaul, the Spaniard, from their camp released, Stroll to the bath, or prank them for the feast; From ruby goblets the Numidian drains The choicest product of Falernian plains, And swarthy Moors on perfumed couches lie And revel with Campanian harlotry. What dome is that so gorgeously deckt, Graceful as built by music? Architect And sculptor have with stone and marble vied In rare achievements, pampering the pride Of fortune's minion, happier might such toys Keep him in dotage, or the coarser joys Of game and wassail satiate his desires: But to more daring follies he aspires, Air-castles he must build, which overthrown Shall draw his country's ruin with his own: 'Tis Virrius, lord of many a fair demesne Watered by deep Vulturnus, meadows green And waving olive groves, broad farms, to which The willing heavens yield tribute, to enrich His vats and cells and garners; wheaten ears Like those that Ceres interwoven bears In her ambrosial locks; fruits that in smell Rival Pomona's breath, in hue excel The fabled orchards of Alcinous; And vintage of the grape so nectarous, Of temper so ethereal, they that sip Dream of Elysium, of companionship With gods and heroes, and th' enchanting kiss Of youthful Hebe, and immortal bliss. That tower-flanked terraced roof, how softly plays The purple even with its odorous bays And myrtles; for the sun delays to set, Tho' prone in western skies; he lingers yet To look on Cumæ's rock and that proud height Where mortals bow before his throne of light, On vine-clad Gaurus, and the fruitful plains Whose bosom his celestial fire impregns, On Ischia's crag, where in his prison lone The Titan rests not, and thy towering cone, Vesevus, and the promontories bold, The glittering shores and cities that enfold Thy glorious gulf. And now the day-god sinks Behind Sardinian mountains, and unlinks His chariot in the main; the landscape fades From Capua's view, and darker fall the shades From oak-crowned Tifata; but on the halls Of Virrius neither shade nor darkness falls; Within his stately portals hath begun Another day unushered by the sun: Lights emulously blaze, and guests pass in, The magnates of Campania, friends and kin, And chieftains of their many-tongued allies, Apparelled like themselves in festal guise, Mantled in scarlet. And to guests like these Light ye the way, ye laurelled effigies, There at the vestibule with homage mute Standing like well-bred lackeys to salute The lords of Carthage? Had ye but a tongue, Astonishment perchance or fear had wrung Another greeting from you. Not so deems Virrius, upon the sea of his proud dreams And wild imaginations now afloat: His eyes rove round the banquet, not to gloat Upon the dazzling splendour, the parade Of golden services, and meats purveyed With exquisitest choice, and gauds that tell Of countless wealth, the pearl, the tortoiseshell, The cedar, and the ivory; but his thought Is on those guests, and marvels to be wrought By their strange advent; Hamilcar's great son, Partner with him in schemes that he hath spun Of policy and war, beside him there Seated in regal state, with gracious air, All courtesies and smiles, smoothed and unbent Each harsher look and sterner lineament; For thus was Hannibal humoured; well he knew The genial arts that captive and subdue The ears and souls of men, and when 'twas fit To hide his greatness, or apparel it In the light garb of affability; E'en mirth from underneath his crafty eye Could twinkle, raillery and sprightly jest, The salt that seasons and gives life and zest To dull discourse, fell smartly from his tongue, And on his lip to serve the moment hung: And Asdrubal is there, the noble-browed, And Hanno, of his ancient lineage proud, Mago, his brother's joy, with him in hate One-minded, as in love, from Carthage late Returned with aid and promise; and the fierce Maharbal, with the flashing eyes that pierce The clouds of battle; and the flower and choice Of Nomad cavaliers, and them whose voice Inflames the courage of Iberian swords And Gallia's, worthy deemed with Punic lords To share the feast or council; not unknown Their names on Latin soil, to vill and town And bristling fortress, whither oft they clove A gory passage, or before them drove The rear of combat or of reeling rout, Tho' Rome's imperial story blots them out From memory's page; brave countenances, scarred With javelin or sword-thrust, that hath not marred Their savage beauty. Nor of mean repute Are Capua's worthies: rumour hath made bruit Of thee, Pacuvius, and thy well-earned claim To win the prize in revolution's game, Maugre the nuptial ties which thee and thine Link with old Cures and the Claudian line, Whose blood in thy son's veins paternal rule Could tame not, nor his patriot passions cool; Treason by treason he was fain to quell, And lift against the honoured guest the fell Assassin's arm; the poniard in his clutch Was glistening; wherefore shrinks he from the touch? “Strike thro' a father's bosom!” that appeal Casts from Perolla's hand the threatening steel; For crime from crime dread intervals divide, And murder is appalled at parricide. So fortune hath preserved her favourite, Preserved for toils and sorrows infinite In the dark bosom of the future stored. Nor lacks thy presence at the festal board, Brave Taurea; better knight or skilfuller In menage of the rein did never spur His courser, whether on the Appian way To join the Roman chivalrous array, Or following the fleet Lucanian boar Thro' forest-path and jungle. Nevermore Shall sylvan sport be thine, nor breezy morn Arouse thee from thy sleep with hound and horn: Early and late must thou be up to scour A desolated country and devour Her wasted fruits, or struggle to keep pace With Afric's fiery sons in flight or chase, Lie on the tentless field, or wait and watch In long and perilous ambuscade, to snatch Some doubtful vantage from the wary foe, Whose might unconquerable thou shalt know Ere summers twain be past, and oh, what sight For Capuan dames, to see from luckless fight Their champion driven, flying in a whirl Of panic at the gate of Jove to hurl His gasping steed! and when before their eyes Beleaguering walls in darkening circuit rise, And her that was so fair and beautiful Destruction fangs, as when some lordly bull A serpent coils around, and none to wrench Its folds from off him—thou into the trench, Gnashing thy teeth, leap'st madly, but to spill The blood of thine own bravest—there, there still Grows, mounts in thy despite the huge blockade, Nor valour can assail, nor craft evade, Hemming thee in with famine and despair! What recketh Taurea now? away with care Or aught that clouds the future! sumptuous fare And social mirth have warmed into his soul; The feast is at its highest, crowned the bowl Massy with gems and gold; and Virrius waves His hand, bespeaking silence, while he craves A health in flowing brimmers to go round: “Health to great Hannibal; and may the sound Of his victorious horsemen soon be heard Upon the shores of Tyber!” At the word A clink of cups and tumult of applause; And on goes Virrius: “In this glorious cause May the celestial powers”—Rash man, forbear! Call not the gods thy vanities to share! Hold, ye Campanian senators! the cup Ye raise so glibly pledges you to sup Together on the gloomy bank of Styx: 'Tis poison in the jewelled bowl ye mix, More baneful than Calabrian serpent's bite Or juice of the relentless aconite: Dash to the ground the sparkling amethyst! See ye not grinning death? a blinding mist Is o'er you: fiends of black Avernus laugh In chorus, while your jocund health ye quaff; Nought but the table's roar is in your ears, The boasts of Virrius, and the noisy cheers Of your companions. Thus then have ye waged Your hopes, your all; Rome's eagles to be caged, And Capua over Italy to reign, She on the land, as Carthage on the main; Whereat a pleasant smile of half disdain Curls Mago's nether lip and Asdrubal's, Unmarked not by the chief. But Virrius calls The long-haired minstrel, whose harmonious quill Takes inspiration from his patron's will, Whose ready tongue can rhapsodize with ease Lyrics and lays to flatter and to please. Campania's old renown and happy clime, These form the sweet preamble of his rhyme, And much upon her noble strife he dwells, And of a great futurity foretells: His quill is laid aside, and he hath bent With trembling fingers o'er the instrument, As tho' its animated strings reveal The thoughts whose echoes thro' the chamber peal; And sings he, as the notes are fiercely played, Of Brennus and the Gaul's resistless raid, The moaning streets of Rome, the fire, the sack, How Tyber his affrighted stream rolled back, And the young eagle cowered like a daw Under the puny Capitol of straw, Who ventured now so haughtily to soar: “That flight is ended! Rome shall be no more! Another Brennus, heaven's avenging scourge, Smites the devoted city! Sing her dirge, Yea, but with other than a mourning strain, Ye nations; all your harmonies unchain; Cannæ and Allia be the glad refrain Of million voices, till Olympus nods From his high summit, and approving gods Answer in thunder!” and the lyre's response In mimic thunder sounded, and at once Upleap the youthful chiefs, and rend the dome With cries of “Allia, Cannæ, death to Rome!” And Hannibal himself, as if the scene Were now enacting, sits with altered mien, Clenching his hand, the master passion, foul As a black tempest, settling in a scowl Over his features: Rome shall be his prey! She, the abhorred one, at his mercy lay! 'Twas but a moment; tones of noisy glee Recall him from his fitful reverie; And he must hence betimes, a rigid law, From deep carouse his presence to withdraw: The most may tarry, and the night prolong In bacchant mirth and revelry and song. A crimson veil is lifted, and displays A choir of damsels to the raptured gaze: A nymph-like figure, radiant as the moon, In vest pellucid and in silvery shoon, Steps gaily to the front; on either side A youth approaches with a stealthy glide, So soft, the liquid air he seems to tread, And both for her disputed favor plead With gesture and with look their amorous suit, Timed to the gentle warbling of the flute; She, archly playful, casts on each by turns A smile that flatters and an eye that burns; Till chidden by the tabour's sudden beat And chiming cymbal, on elastic feet She springs in air away; the twain pursue, And still in dance their rivalry renew; She stops, and at a sign they bend the knee As to the presence of a deity; The maiden choir enclose them in a ring, And on their heads delicious odours fling, Then plunge into the dance's endless chain Held in a mazy whirl by music's rein; And now like swallows float in summer play, Or shadows on a stream of feathery spray, Now toss like ruffled pines upon the hills, Dizzy as Mænads when the wine-god thrills Their palpitating bosoms. Hush; a spell Is o'er them, and like Nereids to the shell Of Triton listening gracefully they group, Their raven tresses on the shoulders droop; The wilder notes have ceased, the flute alone Breathes the soft magic of its silver-tone: A stripling of Milesian parents bred, Effeminately fair, and garlanded With wreath of myrtle, chants a Lesbian lay In melting verse that steals the sense away; Of Spartan Helen and the prince of Troy, And how she hearkened to the beauteous boy, Demure at first and timorously coy, At length to pity moved by his distress, And yielding in a sweet unconsciousness Under the witchery of his caress: “The crime was Love's, Love's only. O ye wise, Blame not their whispers and their tender sighs: For you, for you the god in ambush lies, And ye shall know the power that ye contemn, And ye shall be to folly brought like them, Shall feel the subtle sting, the pleasing wound, That all your lore and wisdom shall confound, Struck by the shafts that men nor gods can shun; Thro' every pulse the vivid lightnings run, Making with life and joy to throb, to pant Bosoms of ice and souls of adamant: For doth not Ares in Idalian bowers Quench the wild passion that his soul devours? And Cynthia quit her sphere to gaze upon The sleeping beauties of Endymion? And the omnipotent, the ever blest, In ravishing delight on Leda's breast Forgets eternal splendours!” Thus the tale; And drops before their eyes the crimson veil: Wine, wine; and fill your goblets to the brim! The feasters loudly call; around them swim The brightnesses of heaven. Again the lyre Clashes in thunder waking martial fire; A youthful Gaul upstarts with flushing face, To sing an ancient war-song of his race; A minute's pause, to gather as he tries The fragments of remembered melodies, Pushing from off the brow his yellow hair, His grey eye wandering, till in vacant stare 'Tis fixt, and he begins: the buzz, the clang Of beakers, all was hushed, while thus he sang: SONG OF THE GAUL. Have ye not heard of Teutomal And his Etrurian raid? A famous chief was Teutomal, Who the might of Gallia swayed: He lifted up his standards All by the banks of Po, Over the meads where Addua speeds To swell his mighty flow; And round them flocked the numbers Of many a tribe and clan, And many a vassal chieftain And sturdy partisan; Insubrians and Salassians, Whom battle never tires, And Cenomanians burning With valour of their sires; The flashing of their broadswords Was glorious to behold, Their kilts, their trews of rainbow hues, And glittering chains of gold; The huntsmen hale of Duria's dale, Who chase the roe and deer, With men of blue Verbanus, The fishers of the mere; The shepherds who from Brixia's flocks Press out the milky store, And miners of Vercellæ Who dig the precious ore; Mediolanum's noblest Will share the bold emprise; Unto their braying trumpets Acerræ's cheer replies; Whose prince was Bellovesus, A youth of high degree, Strong-limbed and stout, and he could shout Louder than any three: And there was fleet Ambiorix, And Dumnorix the tall, And sinewy Britomaris, The bravest chief of all; Whose eyes were like the wild cat's, His hair was fiery red, And flared it like a meteor When the rushing fight he led: He came from far Helvetia, The land of snow and frost, Where over jags of the foamy crags The roaring Rhone is tost; A man of pith and puissance He had slain in drunken feud, Avengers o'er the mountains His hasty flight pursued; He turned on the pursuers, And gave their skins aud scalps To be gnawed by hungry foxes Or bleach upon the Alps, Then bounded like a roebuck Over his toilsome way, And joined him to the foremost Of Teutomal's array. The vines were purpling in the sun, The fields with light were warm, The gathered host of Teutomal Came spreading like a storm: Before them fled in panic dread Etruria's men of arms, And left to easy plunder Their villages and farms; Arretium and Cortona A costly ransom paid For temples and for graven gods, For captive youth and maid; But Clusium barred her massy gates, And sent a numerous band, Who with defence and ambush The fords of Clanis manned: The Gauls come on, the curved shore They see with archers lined, While mailed foot and horsemen Are screened by woods behind; Their bucklers meet the arrowy sleet, As thro' the stream they wade, And soon they drive the archers For shelter to the glade; But scarce the foremost dripping wet Had struggled to the strand, When horse and foot are on them With slaughterous pike and brand; Before the rest came spurring On a steed as white as snow, With purple vest and waving crest, A priestly Lucumo, And fierce he laid about him, And dreadful he appeared With the darkness of his eyebrows And the forest of his beard: Ambiorix and Dumnorix, Who tried to grasp his rein, Beneath him sank on the slippery bank Never to rise again; But Bellovesus shouting In middle stream he smote, The Clanis quickly stifled The lungs and gurgling throat; And fear came over many, And many turned their backs, And unto all cried Teutomal (For sore his grief did wax), He cried, his right hand waving; His left had grasped a tree, For he was stricken with a shaft And sunk upon the knee: “Now by the sun and father Dis I swear, I will repay With noble guerdon, whosoe'er That Lucumo shall slay; For him that brow so threatening now With gold I will inlay, And it shall shine with ruby wine Upon his bridal day; And Gallia's pride shall be his bride, The fairest of the fair, Mine only daughter Guendolen, She of the chestnut hair.” Beside the chieftain posted Young Britomaris stood, His sword and buckler down he threw And leapt into the flood; Just then the snow-white charger Was floundering in the deep, And Britomaris bridges The distance with his leap, And dragging down the rider His neck he tightly clips, An entrance to the bosom His Alpine poniard rips; The leap, the clutch, the death-blow, They followed all so fast, Scarce five you could have counted From the first unto the last; He seized the Tuscan falchion, Upon the steed he sprang, Among the foes his war-shout rose, His smiting weapon rang: As one wind drives another, As a tempest bends the oaks, So swayed he soon the battle With the sweep of his sabre-strokes: The foes in flight, the Gauls in might Are over the watery bed, And on a spear aloft they rear The severed priestly head: Cheerily on the victors Looks down the western sun, And homeward they are marching With spoil and glory won, By the golden leas, by the orchard trees, And amid the blushing vines, And under the silver moonbeam Kissing the mountain pines; From summer eve to midnight Their mingled music rings, So wild a chant, so jubilant As only Gallia sings, Chant of their loves and revels, Chant of their iron wars; The hills are hoarse, as with all their force They echo it to the stars. And soon with other music Resounded Addua's plain, The rippling river halted To hear the jocund strain, A choir of youths and maidens, Who came in dance along, And timbrel, pipe, and tabour, Tuned to the bridal song; Sweeter than babbling fountain Or warbling of the grove, Poured from a hundred voices Their melody of love: A doubling drum proclaims they come, And laurel branches wave; Hurrah for Britomaris, The bravest of the brave! And now of blithe the blithest, As a goodly poplar tree That peers above the saplings, Among his feres is he: The band of maidens follow With rosy garlands crowned, Their cheeks more bright than roses Shed joy and fragrance round; And in the midst is Guendolen, The promised, the betrothed, Her figure light in kirtle white, Her face in beauty clothed; Her bosom heaves like Larius When gentle south-winds breathe, Her eye is like a star that melts His stilly depths beneath; And down upon her shoulders The glossy tresses flow, Like the amber stream of the sunny beam On a ridge of Alpine snow. An oak there was for countless years The monarch of the glade, A spacious ring encompassing With venerable shade; And there a Druid stood within, In age he seemed fourscore, And wreathed about his hoary locks The mistletoe he wore; With marshwort and with hyssop The mistletoe was drest, On his bosom fell the mystic shell Snatcht from the serpent's nest: Here were the bride and bridegroom Under the sacred boughs To join their hands in wedlock bands And plight their mutual vows: The holy priest he looked to the east And muttered solemn prayer, On youth and maid his palm he laid And blest the loving pair: And now again the jocund strain Of pipe and tabour swells, And melodies are floating Adown the vales and dells: But Teutomal to the banquet His chosen warriors led, With venison and with junkets The tables wide are spread, And vessels huge are bleeding With the vineyard's luscious juice, And every heart is merry, And every tongue is loose; The chieftain takes a goblet, With wine he fills it full, And cries—“see here, to make good cheer, The Lucumo's broad skull.” So well 'twas wrought, you ne'er had thought, Under that golden rim Had frowned on hosts of battle The Tuscan's visage grim. “See how I drain the Tuscan's brain To my honoured son and guest:” He tossed it off right lustily, And passed it to the rest; And each man fills, and each man swills His throat with the foaming tide, A rousing toast to the princely host, To the bridegroom and the bride: And so they drank till the daylight sank And they could drink no more: Oh, such a chief as Teutomal Was never seen before; Ne'er looked the skies with their starry eyes On such a wedded pair, As valiant Britomaris And Guendolen the fair.</field>
