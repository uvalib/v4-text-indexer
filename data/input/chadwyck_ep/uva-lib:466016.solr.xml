      <field name="fulltext">THE MARRIAGE BEFORE DEATH, A Tragedy, IN TWO SCENES. ARGUMENT. Diana and Francesco, two Republicans, are imprisoned by their opponents and condemned to death. They are thrown by chance or stratagem into the same cell in the Prison, on the night before their execution. Francesco, who is Diana's impassioned lover, implores on this last night, for a last blossom of sweet life, the bounty of her love. This, after much hesitation, grounded on the thought that to tarry for high angelic union entered into after death would be purer and better, she, trusting in heaven, gives him. And the pure utter passion and joy of it go far towards making Francesco, previously an infidel, save as regards his dream of an ideal earthly Republic, a believer in life eternal and in God. Crowned with this strange last joy, and nobly exultant, they pass the next morning towards their deathââNot as those that have no hope.â And round them their companions sing their last chorus, not without something of a grim envy: though they too are content for the Republic's sake to die. For they pass not as these pass, from a couch of sweet-smelling roses to the black bitter grave; the scent of the flowers of love's sweet immaculate night hangs not round them, only the weird white philosophic or patriotic hope, in the strength of which they walk towards death, not groaning, if not rejoicingâbut such a memory of unutterable and endless fragrance caresses and strengthens, girds and crowns, delights and glorifies these. PERSONS REPRESENTED. Diana. Francescoâher Lover. Chorus of Republicans. Scene I.âIn a large Cell in the Prison. Diana.â And so we die to-morrow. Oh, Francesco, Why have they added torture to our love, And love to torture?âwhy concealed us thus In one same prison, and with these same bands Confined us?âwe who should be gladly cleaving In some bright boat the bright and bounding waves. We are to die: they say so; die to-morrow. The fair Republic that we both do worship Will be the richer by the blood of two To-morrow; lordlier by the martyrdom Of two sad lovers, stricken side by side. But why enclose us not in separate cells For this last terrible and bitter night? Why heap upon the fuel of their rage Fresh, hot, remorseless, glowing coals, that burn The very inmost spirit? Yea, why disturb My peaceful prayers and slumbers by the face Of him I love so madly? My Francesco, What feelest thou? Is it not bitterer yet Than e'en the bitter knowledge of our death To have to blend with this our cypress crown Red roses of warm, living, breathing love? To have, just when we would fix thoughts on heaven, Or, turning to thine own strong hopeless creed, On rest that lasts for everâat that point When all the soul, through agony prolonged, And awful wrestling with its inner self, Is reaching some high fatalistic goal Of snow-white resignation, calm and clear, Just then, at that grand moment, to be merged, Yea, dashed, hurled, plunged within the resonant waves Of earthly passion, foaming on the rocks Of earthly iron cliffs we had left behind For ever and for ever, as we thought? Is this not hard?âthough sweet flowers glitter through Its tangled wood of troubleâhard, as if Some sacred snow-white statue of a god, Spotless, superb, as if from Phidias' hand, Lost suddenly its clear, triumphant calm, Becoming human, and so less divine, Flushed now with roseate, breathing loveliness. Bitter and painful as 'twould be for one Who, climbing now, at last, the golden stairs Of heaven, and halting on the topmost stepâ With all the glorious plains of Paradise Stretched wide before himâshould be flung adown Those high steps, on a sudden, by some hand Remorseless, and for many an evil hour Forced to re-tread the barren ways of earth. Yea, hard as 'twas for dead, glad Lazarus, E'en at the mandate of his Brother and Lordâ E'en for his sisters' and the people's sakeâ Again to clothe himself in carnal robes, And battle once more with the temporal wind; Yet oh! my love, Francesco, it is sweet, Sweet, passing sweet! to see thee even here, And even thus. Francesco.â Oh! sweet Diana mine. Hush! hide thy voice and hide thy face within My bosom; 'tis alive and warm enough To-night to shelter thee. Sweet! be not sad; Be not dismayed; be rather great of heart, And glad and most triumphant, for to-night Shall see our nuptials: not with orange blossom, And fair young girls for bridesmaids, and the stout, True friends of the bridegroom crowding round his path, But with the imminent shadow of foul death To hover over us, and deepen joy, Till it becomes a joy no marriage yet Has feltâa pleasure adequate for gods. Full many a year have lovers to declare And to accomplish all their perfect love, When fate smiles; we have but one single night: Therefore to-night let radiant love be crownedâ Crowned, sweet Diana, with a wreath of flowers Sweet as thine own sweet lips and thy sweet self. See here, there is a small and tender plant, Thin, scanty, white-flowered, climbing o'er the sill Of this our prison windowâlet me wreathe it, With many kisses, in thy dark rich hair! [He approaches her. Diana.â Nay, nay, my lord and lover, be not rash, 'Tis not the time for foolingâthink of death. Franc.â Nay, rather 'tis the time for adding warmth To all the fuel of love that yet remains. Diana.â Sweet, let the sorry embers have their will; But as for us, we'll light a flame in heaven. Franc.â Yea, lady, but the glittering match must first Be struck on earthâI trust no fire of heaven. Diana.â The fire of heaven is an intenser flame Than any scanty pallid passion of earth. Franc.â Try thou my lips, O ladyâif they are cold, Then sigh, and seek angelic lips in heaven. Diana.â Nay, loved one, 'tis thine own sweet lips I need; But perfect-pure, angelic in their touch. Franc.â Angelic they will be when they touch thine: Angelic and immortal never else. Diana.â How can I yield to thee? for 'tis to dash The goblet of pure love upon the ground. Franc.â Nay, 'tis to fill it with a glorious wine, And then to quaff that draught in triumph high. Diana.â Rather to poison with an earthly drug The pure ethereal nectar of our dream. [He approaches nearer. Franc.â How can I give thee up? If heaven is ours 'Twill be the brighter for Love's gift of flowers. Diana.â The flowers of heaven are sweet without our pains, The songs of heaven are fair without Love's strains. Franc.â But fairer for the added voice of Love; Let us, together chanting, pass above. Diana.â Together singingâbut no earthly song; Nay, darling, hinder not, for I was strong. Franc.â Strong, lady, only by forgetting me, Now I am here, that bitter force must flee. Diana.â Nay, love, 'tis I remember things divine; For life, through death, I am altogether thine. Franc.â I have no faith in heavenâno perfect gleam Of joys to come;âgrant me this perfect dream. Diana.â If I should give thee this much longed for flower, Wilt thou believe in Godâat this last hour? Franc.â I will believe in rosesâand in thee: No more can I foretell with certainty. Diana.â If thou art vouchsafed such high joy in this, Wilt thou not trust the Lord for further bliss? Franc.â I will believe in thee and hope in heaven, Which so superb a grace by death has given. Diana.â I know not clearly what may be may part: I know but one thing: whither tends my heart. Franc.â Sweet, be not long consideringâDeath awaits Our coming, just outside our Church's gates. Diana.â I have to dally with thee, for I know That sometimes gifts of woman nurture woe. Franc.â There is but one woeânot to hold thee fast As mine own brideâbride to the very last. Diana.â And what of death? the lips of death are cold. Franc.â But thine are warmâoh blossom of my dream. Diana.â Our destiny is clear, our life is told. Franc.â Not finished yet, remains love's sunset-gleam. Diana.â Is that a gleam to light a man to death? Franc.â Yea! light enough to glorify the tomb. Diana.â Poor is itâfeeble, but a woman's breath! Franc.â Rather the full flame of a woman's bloom. Diana.â Is that a fire whereto a man may trust? Franc.â Yea! all the treasures of his inmost soul. Diana.â Soon will it flickerâsoon be as the dust! Franc.â Ne'er will it cease man's spirit to console. [A pause. She changes her tone. Diana.â Ah, love! Francesco, all the blossom white And maidenly of my heart I give this night, Not keeping any sweet flower back from thee. [Francesco reaches forward and embraces her. Franc.â And IâI take it with a gladdened heart That throbs with kingly triumph in each part Like the full pulses of the storm-struck sea. Diana.â Be tender with me, I have none to aid me, Be gentle now that thou hast all thy will. Franc.â Thou shalt not need a sister to upbraid me, Our passion's wine no hasty hand shall spill. Diana.â Be glad that I will give thee all thou askest, Not waiting heaven to give thee of my store. Franc.â Sweet, in the light of some pure God thou baskest, Dark death may not divide us evermore. Diana.â It cannot sever, unless God be wroth, That I am not to keep my virgin oath, Giving myself too soon, on earth, away. Franc.â Nay, lady, there are debts that love doth owe, And which to be paid must be paid below; While yet we live, and yet 'tis called to-day. Diana.â Thou art my love! Franc.â Thou art my doveâ And my lady of dreams and of glory, To-night is our bridal night, To-night is our life's long story, Our years of thought and delight. To-night we must know each other, Or never, never at all; As lovers, as sister and brother, In chains and in love's soft thrall. All thoughts that lovers are keeping For future pleasures and days, Through our brains to-night must be sweeping. To-night all songs and lays Must soundâfor neverâoh, sweet one, Shall any to-morrow's kiss Atone for an over-fleet one, Complete an imperfect bliss. To-morrow our bodies shall moulder And perhaps our spirits too, The thought makes whiter your shoulder, More crimson your lips' sweet hue. Yea, fairer thou art, my lady, As a dying beautiful rose; Whose petals in grasses shady The cold wind shakes as it blows. Far fairer thou art and sweeter For this one marvellous night, Softer, whiter, completer, More honey-like, bland, and bright; More pure and more smooth and delicious, More ripe and rosy to kiss: For death with his glance suspicious, Waiting to sever our bliss. I love thee the more for the terror That crowns our bridal with gloom, Yea, further life were an error, Seemly and fit is the tomb. For a man when he kisses a maiden, Sweet and pure as thou art, Should die by pleasure o'erladen, Stricken and pierced in the heart. He should not live till to-morrow, Having won one beautiful rose; He should not tarry for sorrow To smite, as a shower of snows; He should not linger nor tarry, Having kissed, having loved, having won; His pleasure and joy let him carry Beyond the setting sun. Yea, life would hinder and spoil it, The new-found, beautiful grace, Mar and finger and foil it, Dim the bloom of the face Of love,âlet lovers be wary Of how they linger in life; True love is cautious and chary Of bliss; he carries a knife To sever, and smite, and sunder The passionate, glorious cords; He strikes in a peal of thunder, As lightning are his shrill swords. If love abounds, and is ample, Let lovers watch and beware, Lest his following fast foot trample, His following swift hand tear; Lest all be over, or ever The strains of joy were begun; And the kiss be completed never; And the first fair strands undone; And the pleasures tarnished and broken, In the midst of a loud wild wail; Sweet whispers but half spoken, Sweet faces suddenly pale, Strong hands made suddenly weaker Than wan waves under the dawn; And soft lips silent and meeker Than death, when the veil is drawn Across some dear face shrunken, Where once was a rose so red; A flower that had eaten and drunken To the full of the suns that are fled:â But we, my lady, are safer Than this. We need not fear; Our life's seal is but a wafer; The swift destroyer is near, Who shall break the seal, and deliver Our spirits, if such there be? We need not quake nor shiver; We cannot tremble and flee. Yea, soon we shall know for certain The wonder that lies beyond; We shall peer behind the curtain With glances tender and fond, To see whether death be truly The last destroyer, or no: Whether life beginneth newly, The river again to flow, The water again to glimmer In sweet blue ripples,âthe foam Again to sparkle and shimmer, Fresh wandering feet to roam, Fresh wondering eyes to wonder At new-found marvellous scenes, Fresh skies to threaten and thunder, Fresh buds to broider the greens; Fresh roses, red, and a glory, To glitter along the ways, Fresh May-bloom, fragrant and hoary, To brighten the spring with its blaze; Fresh friends to talk and to ponder, Fresh lovers to laugh and to kiss; Whether new joys wait for us yonder, Loved one, fervent as this! We shall know whether this one pleasure Be surely, certainly, all; Life's supreme meet measure: Whether the fruit must fall Being ripe now, perfect and rounded, Red and sweet as thy lips! Whether once God's mercy abounded, Then that suffered eclipse. Or whether beyond the thunder, Beyond the stars and the waves, Are yet new regions for wonder, Built above sins and graves. Whether yet beyond the roaring Of Death's white terrible foam, God waits preparing, out-pouring Lifeâproviding a homeâ A home for lovers and sinners, A home for patriots tooâ So that through death we are winners Of life, and of love made new. But IâI build not a minute Upon the uncertain hope That may have no truth in itâ I face the axe or the rope With eyes as fearless and steady As those of the martyr who Holds life but a stream or an eddy Of heaven's broad seas of blue. I go to my fate quite fearless, For, lady, have I not thee, Superbâso noble and peerless, A blossom of purity; Yea, have I not thee to guide me Towards heaven, through death's cold stream, To help and cheer, and to chide me If I quail, though it be in a dreamâ Have I not this perfect marriage As a red, red rose to wearâ A scaffold for bridal carriage, Butâthe fairest bride of the fair. The fairest flower of flowers, The loveliest gift of days, The choicest guerdon of hours, Surely I can but praise, Praise fate, praise heaven who grants me Just at the point of death A flower whose bloom enchants me, A blossom of so sweet breath That all the swords and the trouble Darken, and disappearâ Death's waves are smooth, not a bubble Breaks, though death be near. All is peace, and a shining, Glad, fair road to the stars; Or to a rest unrepining That no black enemy marsâ All is peaceâO flower This thou hast brought to me, Hope in the last wild hour, Joy in extremity. If not faith, yet a glimmer Of sweet glad faith in God; My pathway had been dimmer, No star had flashed on the sod, If thou, O woman, O blossom, Had'st not so tenderly saved, By the balm of a snow-white bosom, By the banner of joy thou hast waved: By gifts so perfect and ample, That all my heart is a flame Too large for death to trample, Too bright for the sword to shame. Diana.â And I am content, O love, That this fair joy should be; God's gift it is from aboveâ God's sweet gift given through me. As yet thou seest alone The humble ministerâme; Not God on His great gold throne, No bright futurity; But be thou sure that Godâ The great fair Lord and King, Lord of the earth's bright sod, Who broodeth with bright gold wing Above each glimmering place Like a glittering faint fair starâ Will show thee His grand pure face Ere thy spirit has wandered far Beyond the river of death. Like a pure rich fire He may come, In the wind's clear outpoured breath, In a rose's red rich bloom, In my own risen voice Perhapsâor another's tone; I know not;âthou shalt rejoice In the pleasure of God, mine own. Thou shalt find the Lord of Hosts, That His glory is no sick dream, Nor His ministers faint sad ghosts, Nor His heaven a mere stray gleam; Thou shalt find it sweetly true; Thou shalt step within the gates Health and life to renew; For the holy Lord God waits, Francesco, yearning for thee, Francescoâlonging to bring Thy spirit in purity Within the courts of the King. I hold that our love is nought, An adulterous woman I, Had my heart a foul thing brought, A passion fated to dieâ I hold no love of avail That lives not ever within God's holiest temple's veil, Made pure from each taint of sinâ Pure as the Christ is pure, Too strong for death to hold, Able a life to secure, And a love that turns not cold. Thou art strong to die for the sake Of the fair Republicâthinkâ Thou art willing to walk to the stake, Of a fiery death to drink, For truth and for thine own soul, Without the help of a creed; To reach such a sweet high goal, On Calvary Christ did bleed. Yea, God then suffered to win For Himself, for a pure white bride The whole earth gathered in To His gathering heart, to His side. Not for a nation He Did suffer death on the Cross, But for every shore of a sea, For all peoplesâwithout the loss Of a single straggling oneâ That He might claim in the end Each lover of truth for a son, Each warrior-soul for a friend. So He set an example high, Not dreading the cold foul death, Not flinching really to die, And be utterly void of breath; No pictured death was His, No faint similitude, But a death as real as this, That to-morrow, with anguish rude, Shall try and test our hearts, Whether we can endure or no Hot agony's piercing darts, Dissolution's icy throe. God has tried it first; He felt the hunger and pain, The wild sick spasm of thirst, The hot mad throbs in the brain. The road we tread He has trod, And the path is dim no more, For the lamp of the passion of God Was there as a flame of yore. So doubt not, lover sweet! That our death is but as a dream, From which we shall wake to meet, Having crossed the sad, cold stream. [She kisses him tenderly, and gives him a red rose from her bosom. Diana.â This rose I give thee: they have spared it to me; Upon thy breast to-morrow let it shine. Franc.â It is as fire from heaven to renew me, Since, choicest rose of roses, thou art mine. Diana.â Now, let us part a season; all I told thee I will without fail, ere the morrow, do. Franc.â Yea, sweet! for one sweet night I shall enfold thee In passion's arms: give love one sweet long view. Diana.â Keep thou the rose; the living rose, soon dying, Is not for thee till strikes the midnight bell. Franc.â Till strikes that hour, forlorn, I shall be sighing; When strikes that hour, though doomed, it shall be well. Diana.â Remember, 'tis for Heaven's sake that I love thee. Franc.â Remember, 'tis for thy sake that I burn. Diana.â Remember, 'tis my trust that this may move thee. Franc.â Remember, 'tis through thee that death I spurn. Scene II.âOn the way to Execution. âA large company of Republicans marching along; Diana and Francesco in their midst. They all sing: Chorusâ We are passing along to our agony red; We are doomed, we are stricken, made one with the dead. Diana.â Yet a hope doth remain. Chorusâ For the people we die; for the people we go Towards the swords that are sharpened, the faggots that glow. Franc.â But we heed not the pain. Chorusâ There are two that have drunk of a pleasure so deep That they heed not the timeâthey are sunk in a sleep. Diana.â We see clearer than ye. Chorusâ A lover has played with the loose sweet hair Of his lady so long that he heeds not the snare. Franc.â 'Tis no trap set for me. Chorusâ When love can make strong twain souls with his song, And annihilate death by the bloom of the breath Of woman, there's hope in spite of the rope, And chance of reward in the track of the sword, And pleasure to gain in the pathway of pain, And a clamour of lyres in the midst of the firesâ Franc.â And loveliest flowers in these last hours, Rich roses in bloom round the sides of the tomb, And a glory to save in the mouth of the graveâ Diana.â And a God to defend at the uttermost end And to raise from the deadâ'tis to life we are ledâ But a passing breath is the wind of our death; The sun of our day shall abide alway. So be of good cheerâdeliverance is near; Our Republic to save we pass to the grave. Francesco, rememberâthou hast thy rose? Franc.â On my bosom a peerless blossom it glows. Diana.â Dost thou fear? I fear notâI think not, at least. Franc.â Nay, lady! my vision on thee I can feast. Diana.â And I feast my vision on God most high; Franc.â And I upon theeâit is sweet to die; Diana.â Yea, sweet, for God and my lover are nigh; Franc.â Calm, lady, and clear is the glance of thine eye; Diana.â It is fixed upon Godâit is firm and sure: I feel that our passion and pleasure were pure; I know that a love so intense must endure. Sweet heart, good-bye! TUA-TUA: or, ROSE-ROSE: This poem is founded on a superstition prevailing among certain savage tribes, to the effect that if one person considers himself to have been injured by another he may secure an inexorable vengeance by entering the house of the person he desires to punish, devoting him or her with solemn curses to the Fetish, and then, in the presence of the person so devoted, killing himself. After this, the unfortunate object of his vengeance has no possible mode of escape; she or he is handed over to the priests, taken to a lonely spot, and duly sacrificed with all the bitter and bloody rites of their abominable religion. A Dramatic Poem, IN THREE SCENES. PERSONS REPRESENTED. Tua-Tua: or, Rose-Rose. A Dyak Maiden, living in an island adjacent to Borneo. Roco. A native of the island; in love with Tua-Tua. Robert Campbell. An Englishman, wrecked on the island; also in love with Tua-Tua. Chorus of Dyak Maidens, Chorus of Dyak Priests, English Sailors, etc. Scene I.âIn a Dell in the Forest. âSunset fading into night.âRoco, alone, singing to a strange discordant native instrument: [Roco] We love: not like the whites:â The delights Of love, if they fail, We assail. Lo! my lance As the glance Of a woman is bright:â Lo! my sword On the sward I rest softly to-night. Lo! I wait For my fate, And my fate waits for me; And the god And his rod Wait for some one; 'tis she. (The branches part, and Tua-Tua enters softly, coming down a woodside path slowly and carefully. She is pale, and trembles slightly. She looks round somewhat timidly, and, seeing Roco, advances.) Tua-Tua.â You sent for me. Roco.â I did. [A pause. He says no more. (Tua-Tua stands before him, her hands hanging folded in front of her, her eyes looking down)â [Tua-Tua] You sent for me. [Another pauseâlonger. You sent for me. [Another pauseâlonger still. (She turns, as if to depart.) Roco (with voice gradually growing louder and fiercer)â I sent for you; and youâyou know the cause. Have I not seen you with the Englishman? Have I not seen him growing day by day Dearer, and felt that as he dearer grew I, Roco, grew perpetually less dear? Did I not see you kiss him?âyes, last nightâ (You never kissed me so. I am not blind!) Did I not see you give him the white blossom Fresh from your hair? (You never gave me one! I am not mad: I mark, I understand.) [Raising his voice somewhatâ Now, Tua-Tua, here am I to-night, I, Roco, your old loverâyour old slave!â Yes, so it used to be in the happy days. Here am I, and I swear you shall not go Till you have given me burning kiss for kiss. Kiss meâif you can love me, all the better; If you are not so gifted, all the worse: Kiss me, you shall! (Tua-Tua glances round once; then meets his eyes once without flinching, and looks down again.) Kiss me. Well; kissing is too much. Give me your hand. Tua-Tua.â I will not. Roco.â Then you shall kiss me. Tua-Tua.â No, Roco. Don't be foolish. I remember As well as you the early happy daysâ Happy they wereâthe boyish girlish days Among the gaudy blossoms, by the streams, Upon the hills. Don't let us spoil those days. I have not changed: I gave you all I could, I give you all I canâI have not changed. 'Tis you have changedâyou are not the old Roco. Come, be the old true Rocoâbe to-night The glad, old honest Roco. Roco.â Kiss me, then. Tua-Tua.â Nay! that were not the glad old courteous Roco. Roco.â You do not know me, I have sworn an oathâ Vowed to the Fetish. Ah, you tremble now; You know the nature of a Fetish oath. Sworn to the Fetish either I will have Your body living, or that he shall have Your blood, your bones, your bodyâstabbed and dead. By all our sacred gods the Englishman Shall never have you; I will kill you first, But through the Fetishâbloodier, fiercer deathâ Kill myselfâkill your loverâdye the world In one broad, bitter, red, tremendous stream. You do not know me; come, sweet lips, be wise. Tua-Tua.â You do not know me. Roco.â Yes, I know you well. You are a bunch of flowers for man to kiss And fondle withâNo more, I think. Tua-Tua.â Just so. Because I am a bunch of flowersâno moreâ Why any gathered bunch will serve your need; I'll pick you in the forest thousands such. Aye, there are girls who are indeed not more, Some, perhaps, not quite as much. There's HadiflÃ¨e, Ashan, Floriflua, Tetua, Honnimel,â Why one of these might suit you. Let me go. Roco, dear Roco, will you let me go? I'll always loveânot loveâbut honour youâ Pray for you at the altar of the gods. [She stoops and picks a flower. Here is a blossom for youâlet me go. Roco.â Do you love me? Say it, and I will let you go. Tua-Tua.â Not that, not that. Here, take the blossom, Roco. See how the white is garlanded with green. Roco.â Do you love me? Say it, and I'll let you go. Tua-Tua.â You do not mean this, Roco?âyou're in play? Roco.â Do you love me? Say it, orâI shall not ask Again. Do you love me? Tua-Tua.â I love you not. Roco.â Then by the altar of our sacred god, I curse you, curse you, curse you, Tua-Tua; I curse your lips that kissed the Englishman; I curse your bosom that the Englishman Had kissedâand fondled tooâif you had let him: I curse your luring voice, so subtle-sweet; I curse your whole smooth bodyâfragrant now As this smooth, shining flower I pluck and place Within my mouth, and spit out to the ground As soon the god shall spit your body out; Fragrant no more, a burnt and withered thingâ Black, bleeding, horrid, sickly, nauseous, foul Disgustingâpalpitating yet from death, From knives, and from the embraces of the priests. Ah, girl, you don't know all; nor will you know Until the sacrifice is all fulfilledâ Until upon the altar, panting hard, Bound for the torture, fragrant for the knife, You look straight up onceâyou will not look twiceâ And see the passion in the hot priest's eyes (The priest whose lot has fallen to him to have The lone fruition of the sacrifice), The lust, and love, and fierce religion mixed. Ah, flowerâah, fragrant flowerâfragrant for whom? Not for your English lover after all. Him, too, I curse, and all his haughty ways; His high disdain of usâhis spotless fleshâ His glittering eyesâhis ever-ready sword. Tua-Tua.â Love? Yes this is love. Oh, fool, I know you now, And soon shall you know Tua-Tua. Fool, Now I am strong: I am a girl no more, A woman brimming over with my sex. I love the Englishman, yesâlove himâlove him. I love, love himâlove him, love him, love himâ And you; why you I hate. Do you hear my words? [Drawing nearer. I hate you, you are but a wretched coward. I hate you, and for all you have to say, For all your cries and curses dread you not. I love my lover, love his golden hair, Worship the sea within his sea-blue eyes, Worship a purity enshrined therein, Of which he has taught me somewhat; every step Of his fair feet upon our island grass I follow in awe and worship; oh you fool! Fool, wretched brainless heartless parrot-head Ape-heart, and soul of shell-fish; go and seek [Pointing sea-ward with her left hand. Your like amid the coral and the weed That shine beneath the sea thereâgo and search; Do you hear me; go I say. Or tarry here; Yes, tarry here; it is the better thing, Stay here and listen while a woman's voice Laughs at you. Roco, do you hear me laugh? Or are you deaf; struck deaf as well as fool? You cannot hear me laughâthen see me laugh: See the white, shining teeth I show at youâ I'll kiss youâkiss you with my pearl-white teeth. Oh! I could grind them through your every bone And laugh to see the blood spirtâfoul thick blood, Far, far too thick to spirt and splash, it must be; But I am wildâam wicked; oh, blue eyes Of my sweet lover, ye would now reprove! For all my speech I've not forgotten you, For all my wild and wayward speech, no whit, No whit have I forgotten. Christ was calm, They say; He answered not with anger thus; Oh, help me, Christ! And as for youâyou fly, You fish, you RocoâI just simply hate you; I spit you out as you spat out the flower. Roco.â And I, I curse you; go and talk of love Now to your lover; kiss him gentlyâso. [Picking another flower, and making believe to kiss it gently. He only loves you for your beauty; when The beauty's gone, the love will vanish too. He'll fling you forth as I fling forth this flower, And tread you, as I tread it, in the dust, I go to bring to pass the Fetish doom. Tua-Tua (sinking down among the flowers, utterly exhausted).â Ah, Robert! Christ! I do want to be good. I have said too much. [Then, half-rising. I do so hate him! yet I love you more Than I hate him; for you I could forgive him. Christ help me! Robert help me! I must rest, Must even sleep, it may be, for a little. What was the prayer you taught me, Robertâwords About forgiving even one's enemiesâ And surely Roco is a deadly enemy. [She falls asleep on the grass, wearied out, sayingâ I hate you Roco; yet love, love is best; To Robert and to Christ I leave the rest. Good-night. Scene 2.âIn the forest. Robert Campbell and Tua-Tua resting upon a bank overhung with flowers, in sight of the ocean. Robert.â My dark-skinned beauty of the tropic wood My âTua-Tua,â âRose-Rose,â flower of flowers, Come nearer; lean a little closerâso. Kiss me, sweetheart; nay, shrink not so away, The seal of love in England is a kiss, And all about my country you were once Eagerâon fire with eagernessâto learn. A change has come, I know; this dismal Fetish Has claimed you for a sweet voluptuous prey; Your soft limbs, gathered on the altar dark, In the grim austere valley of the god Will shortly bleed beneath the bitter knife, And all the priests who perpetrate the foul, The foul, accursed superstitious rite, Will laugh, and praise their high gods for the deed. That black and grass-grown valley will be fair With your warm, bounding, joyous, girlish blood; And IâI shall returnâor not return! Pass home to England sadder, but more wise, Having learned how superstition lingers yet In these fair islands: how a priestly knife At the instigation of a cowardly heartâ (For he is a coward; I must call him that! Your lover, Tua-Tua, is a coward. Coward he is, although his lifted hand Smote the foul superstitious life away From his own body, out of love for youâ What he calls loveâin order to procure The grievous Fetish vengeance; that, being dead, And having with his final breath invoked The Fetish curse upon your darling head, He might, a spirit of spirits among the rocks, A weird grey spirit among the weird dark rocks, See all your red dear blood-drops trickling down, Vowed for a pleasant offering to the god. That was his vengeance! yea, that was his love! His evil, dark-skinned love; the best that he, Your lover and your servitor, could do! Now what is English love; the fairer love, Born under skies of which we used to talk, And which I promised you should one day see? Is it that piteous, self-seeking thing, Which revels in the ruin of the soul And body of the loved one, if her heart Be given elsewhereâas your heart was given Not to the pale self-murderer, but to me. A man has died that you, my sweet, might die. A man has died to kill. Can no one die To bless and to deliver and to save? White skin for darkâwhite heart for whiter heart, Red blood for red bloodâstrength for supple power, True man for woman: Robert for his love. Lily for Rose; Lily you used to call meâ Do you remember? In that all my face Was fresh with English breezes, clear and fair!) What was I saying about my home just now, Before your cruel lover crossed my mind? Oh! that your death being over I might pass Home to my country sadder yet more wise, Having learned how superstition lingers still In many an island of this wondrous land, This Bornese Archipelagoâhow God, In cleansing sundry corners of the earth, By His own thunderstroke, from time to time, Left this still evil, merciless, impure. This I should learn, I say, and carry home, A lesson burnt upon my brain and heart. But, sweet, I will not leave you; Tua-Tua, Rose-Roseâthere must be some far fitter way, Some hope, some swift avoidance, some escape. Oh, for a British vessel, for stout hands, Brave hearts of England, if but four or five, To bear the painter and his lady-loveâ His dark-skinned, perfect-bosomed lady-loveâ Out to the breezes of the briny sea! Oh, dark-blue ocean, rolling sultry waves Upon the sand before usâoh, still sea, Oh, heaving, purple, pitiless broad sea, Unintermittent with thy monstrous waves, That climb for ever on this snowy shore, Swelling in awful squadrons without windâ Take thou my cry to England. Oh, calm seaâ Take thou her cry to Englandâtake our cryâ Let England's daughters, fair and white and sweet, Hear this their sister, fair and dark and sweet, (And me their brother, English-born and strong) As on this island in the strange far sea We face the imminent approach of death! A death most horridâfork-tongued, devilish. Yea, as we waitâfor who am I, to leave My gentle, sweet love-lady to herself? I will not leave her. Oh, my English land, Oh, white far cliffs of Englandâoh, high shores, Sweet grass and clover scenting English fields, And all pure thoughts and converse of the free; Oh, women of England, who shall hear our tale, For nothing now is hidden in the end, And men of England who shall hear it too And feel your brave hands tingle for a swordâ Judge me, if this be not my path of right. It is not suicideâit may be blessed To some all-righteous and auspicious end, But, if it be not blessed to worldly joy, It shall be blessed to spirit-ecstasy. For we shall die together, she and I, Lips cling to lips upon the funeral pyre, Breast cleave to breast beneath the heavy knife, Spirit embracing spirit, seek the stars! Oh, dear, far cliffs of England, fare ye well. And welcome all ye valleys of fierce heat, Ye tangled forests, strange and terrible, Horrid with swamps, or grand with awful flowers, Sweet as the centre of my Blossom's lipsâ Welcome ye regions fathomless, wherein My true love like some perfect butterfly Gleamed first, a radiant shape, across my path; Sweeter ye are to me because of her, Fairer ye are to me because of her, Than all the wind-swept, unscorched English glades. Yea, Tua-Tua kiss meâart not thou My sweet sea-breeze of Englandâmy divine Savour of clover, and the happy cliffs? More art thou unto me than all these things; These, more than these. And thine own glory too Thou hast; the blossoms of this gorgeous land Are all made doubly fragrant in thine hair. Something thou hast within thy wondrous eyes Of those clear wondrous heavens that arch the sea; And all thy voice is silver as the choirs Who crowd at early morn thine echoing woods. Seeâkissing this red blossom thou hast twined Within thine unsurpassable loose hair, I swear I will not leave thee, though I die. Tua-Tua.â My love, my true brave-hearted English lover, It is no use, unless indeedâbut nay! It is no use. What can my sweetheart do Against a whole fierce tribe of armed men? For all our tribe, from immemorial time, Has given support and honour to the priests. My lover diedâhe killed himself, and, dying, Invoked upon me the last curse of heaven, Devoting me to the Fetish; so I die. Ne'er yet has one soul so devoted fled The wrath of priests and gods; it would be impious! True, thou hast told me of a softer creed, Of Christ (is that the name?) with tender eyes, And tender ministry of upraised hands, Blessing, not slayingâsaving, not destroyingâ But He is far away; His face is fair, I know it is, like thy face: it is clear, And strong, and calm, and kingly; yea, His eyes Have surely the sweet colour of thine own; Blue, like the blue seaâand His hair is soft, And gold, and long and wavyâlike thine own. Perhaps thou art Christ! thou art the Christ, to me, To Rose-RoseâTua-Tua; thou art her Christ, Her king, her lord, her saviourâyet, my sweet, King, love, and lord, and saviourâme, thy poor And humble dark-skinned love, thou canst not save! To-day we are free; no single soul to-day Will interrupt; it is the custom here, Like all such customs, faithfully observed, That the last day before a woman falls Stricken on the blood-stained altar to the gods, She is given perfect freedomâand 'tis thought That whoso spies commits an impious act. She comes and goes as her own heart ordains. Therefore to-day is ours: to-morrow theirs. Kiss me, oh, English loverâkiss me hard, Yea, soâand soânow kiss me yet again. See how I take the blossoms from my hair, All loose, and pouring downward to my feet, My black wild hair, that you, my lover, loveâ See how I take the blossoms one by one, And twine them in the bright gold of thine own. There, they look better now; the black hair spoilt them! They needed thy bright locks and thy bright eyes To show them. Ah! you are so beautiful! And there are girls in England, are there not? One dayânot long to wait, for I shall die To-morrow, and a ship will shortly sailâ One day they'll see you, call you beautiful, Caress you, kiss you. Will they kiss like this? And they are white and fair, with golden hair And sea-blue eyes, like yours; you will forget Your dark-skinned maiden in their tender arms. Oh, England! country of my true heart's love, Dearly I love thee, love thee for his sake; Yet never shall I see thy green, cool shore, But here amid the burning island rocks Must perish, perish, perishâand alone! Ah, Christ!âah, gods of my own tribe and race! Help meâoh! help meâpatiently to bear. Now listen lover: nothing can avert The vengeance of the Fetish; but to-day Is ours, and love's, and life's; hear thou this songâ I made it for theeâif my English falters, Laugh not but only smileâmy dying gift. But rest thy gold head first upon my bosom; See, I uncover it alone for thee. I take away, I daughter of a king, The ancient Dyak monarch of this wildâ I tear away the brazen close cuirass And press theeâthusâto the naked, heaving breast No eye of living man till now has seenâ Only the maidens, the attendant girls, Bathing me daily in the crystal stream That flows beside the palace; in the pool Guarded, and fenced, and watched. But now press close, Oh sweet, oh king of men, oh Englishman! Take all I have to give thee for thine own. Press close and listen:â She sings:â Leave, oh! leave me, lover dear, Peril and swift death are here. Kiss and leave me. Blood-stained priests are on the track; Swiftly fly and glance not back. Heaven, receive me! How I love thee who can tell? Other maids may kiss as well In other lands; But, oh! the beating, burning heart, Thine in its inmost every part, Who understands? Ah, sweet, sweet! I give away Thine eyes of blue to eyes of grey; Thy golden hair To golden locks or locks of brown; The gift Christ gave I must put downâ It was too fair. Too fair, too fair for dark-skinned maid, And therefore up the black sad glade I have to go. Alone, alone, apart from theeâ A girl's blood for a penalty Must flow. Farewell, farewell; but when you kiss The next red mouth, remember thisâ [Kisses him. Remember me. This lock of hair, this one red flower, Give to thy maiden in that hour; Give it with glee. Robert.â And I can sing. A painter though I am By trade, I have the artist's general gift; And I will turn it now to good account. Listen, my Rose-Rose, how I answer thee. He sings:â Rose-Rose, fairest flower of mine! In English meadows thou shalt shineâ Or I will die With thee, with thee, sweet blossom, here, And hold thee for that death more dear, Hold thee more nigh. The black death comes, the blue eyes shineâ They were not God's, they were not thine, If they should swerve. This bitter fate that tries us hard The gates of love hath quite unbarredâ Made straight each curve. By God I swear, and by thine hair, And by thy face so dark and fair, And by thine eyes, And by thy lips made mine for ever, That death shall join, and shall not severâ That death's mouth lies. By Christ I swear, by His sun-bright hair, And by the tides of English air And English sea, That I will hold thee to the last As my own brideâthusâwarm and fast; Trust thou me. By eyes of English women now Fixed on my heart and on my brow, Waiting to learn What one lone Englishman can do When love is strong and love is true, I will not turn. Scene III.âChorus of attendant Dyak Maidens, bringing Tua-Tua bound towards the Altar of the Fetish in the black stony valley. Priests of the god, Soldiers, etc. âRobert Campbell leaning against a rock, quiet but alert. The dead body of the lover exposed on a rock near, in the full glare of the sun. Women hacking at it with knives from time to time. [The Dyak Maidens sing, leading Tua-Tua along:â We are bringing a flower To death's faint bower; Hearken, O god! O Fetish holy, We lead her slowly To thine abode: A woman most fair, With flower-filled hair; Be gracious, O god! Let thy vengeance as fire leap forth From the east to west and the north. Let her limbs be sweet, And her naked feet. Listen, O god! O deity holy, We drag her slowly To thine abode: A maiden most pure, Her beauty secure For thine arms for ever, O god. Let thy fury as flame abound, And this deed to thy glory redound. Let her maidenly glance Flinch not for the lance. Hear us, O god! Let her maidenly look Gaze full at the hookâ The bent steel goadâ That shall shortly impale The flesh we unveil, Singing All hail, Greeting, O god! Chorus of Priests:â Swiftly bring her to the flaming altar; Let your lingering steps, oh maids, not falter: Ready are the knife, the fire, the halter. Bring the maiden most sweet To the god's dear feet; Bring the woman most fair To the god's black lair; That he With ravenous hands May hurry and tear; And the sands When she Faints suddenly, Tortured and smitten, By the keen steel bitten, May hide her forlorn, from all lands. So shall glory abound, And the fame of our race Resound In every place. Swiftly bring her, maidens; falter not:â Bear her towards the blood-stained, guarded plot:â Let all hearts sing, For a joyous thing It is that the gods prepare This body of maiden fair, With beautiful loosened hair, For their sacred feast. Let each High Priest In his happiness singâ Till the far rocks ring. For to-day the favour of God most high Descends in a rain of blood from the sky, And a glory of heaven and of pleasure is nigh. Sing therefore:â A stranger is leaning against the rocks, Let him see no mortal the great god mocks:â See wherefore We bring an offering fairer than flocks, Softer than flowers From softest bowers; More sweet, more fragrant, purer than these, To the high god's temple, our great god's knees,â Let the stranger, coming from strange, dim seas, Mark how in the hot, delirious breeze We dance round her Whom our hands confer On our god, our god to please. Let him know that our gods are pureâ Let him feel that their laws are sure. Let him see that our hands are firmâ That a life is a bud in the germâ A broken shell on the shore, A bubble of foam,âno more. Bring the knife, For her life. Robert (stepping forward, and addressing himself to the Chief Priest)â Hold! Is there no other way by which the oath May be accomplished, and the maiden saved? I know not all your customs, yet I feel That in the subtle sacrificial rites Which you observe, there must be holy means By which the god at once may be appeased, The maiden saved, the nation glorified. Speak; is there aught that I, a stranger here, Yet wishing welfare to the maid, can do? Chief Priest.â Nothing; for blood is spilt, and blood must flow. Helpless, the maiden towards our god must go. Maiden Chorus.â Surely she must, with pang and wail and throe! Priest Chorus.â Which please the deities, laughing far below! Robert.â But in this godless gospel of despair Is there no hope concealedâno latent flower With seemly petalsâthough the petals be Of livid texture, of smooth lustrous red? A red plant better is than none at all! Speak priests, speak maidens, speak ye clustering forms Chanting this doleful litany i' the air! Is there no hope? If blood must flow for blood Why must the blood of this sweet maiden flow? Are there no gifts that please the nether gods Save maidens' bodies? Will not strength avail, Power, vigour, manhoodâare not these divine? Are not divine things gracious gifts for gods? Chief Priest.â Yea, these are good; but woman is the flower Chosen to deck the great god's holiest bower. Maiden Chorus.â Soon will arrive her last, yet glorious, hour! Priest Chorus.â Oh, great god, pity us; thy bounty shower! Robert.â It cannot be: speak priest; I see thy face With something in it of relenting thought. Chief Priest.â A way there is; but never hath it been Within the memory of our people used. But yet 'tis written in our sacred books, Which I have studied till my eyes grew blind With patient poring o'er the lettered page. A way there is; for if a man will go (So it is written) patient to the death, A maiden dedicate may be redeemed. But bitter are the terms, the rules annexed! Written it is that not by one straight blow The man shall perish, as the mai den might By one straight blow have perishedâbut that he Shall linger three days, starving, tortured, hewn, Stabbedâfacing death in horrible mute ways, Whereof the record tells not; and this rule The god imposes in that no one man Dying by common death, though he be strong, Firm-sinewed, supple, agile, fearless, fair, Can, like the tremulous and dying form Of some delicious, panting, bright-browed maidâ (Praise to the god!âmay all his altars gleam With many a such auspicious sacrifice! Praise to the god!âmay his rule last for ever!) No man can, like a quivering, slender maid Glut the great-hearted frenzy of the godâ And stir to feverous fire of high delight, Religious madness foaming at the lips, His gladdened, patient-hearted worshippers. Therefore, a maid being more than three times worth A manâso estimates the amorous godâ A man must die three times, must die three days, That is to say, must spend three days in dying. Then shall the maid, if she have heart to kiss The dead man's corpse, and heart to vow a vow Solemn, firm-ratified by conscious heavenâ A vow to live and die unwed henceforthâ Then shall she, having vowed, be wholly free. Robert.â Ah! Now I know the meaning of her speech, That short âunless:â she strangled on her tongue, The âunless indeed:â she knew of this strange way, She knew, but would not tell meâperfect heart. Priest, I am English, I am not your own To take, to bind, to do with as you will; But yours I will be for this woman's sake. What are three days in hellâfor this is hell, This rocky, sun-smit, devil-haunted gladeâ What are three days in hell to years in heaven? Gazing, perhaps towards the gold-haired Christ My lady dreams of; gazing, perhaps, towards Him, With her I died for smiling by my side. I see it all; this rock is Calvary; I am Christ's deputy; He is not here But I am hereâor Christ is here in meâ And I am sent to plant the blood-stained cross Of my own tortured body on this hill. So be it. Tua-Tua.â Lily! [He turns and meets her eyes straight. They are full of tears. Robert.â Yes, Rose-Rose. Tua-Tua.â Did you quite forget That though the others knew your language not, Me you have taught itâdid you quite forget That, bright-eyed Lily, when you spake aloud? Ah, even if you had not uttered speech So clear, so bold, your eyes so bold and clear Would have made all your marvellous purpose plain. But I am Tua-Tuaâdaughter fair Of the great king. Lily, you shall not die. Rather will I, by cursing the grim god And all his priestsâyes, sweet, for you I dareâ Bring down his utter vengeance falling now Swift, sudden, sure, remorseless, on myself. Lilyâyou shall not do it. Robert.â Stay me not. For all the wind of England in my hair Is playing cool and sweetâ'tis not the draught From yon dark cavern fringed by emerald fern, It is not that, but the cool, perfect breeze Scented with July grass from English cliffsâ I see the cliffs, and all the cliffs are lined With women watching how, beneath the sun, I, English, for their sister-woman act. WatchingâI hear their voices silver-sweet, I see their eyes of beautiful sea-grey, Sea-blue, sea-green, or tender loveliest brown; I hear their voices, and I see their eyes, And all their waving, wondrous, lily-hands Bowed gently to the English breeze that sweeps The cliff, do point me one wayâtowards my death. Oh, Tua-Tua, sweet, implore me not. I could not look an Englishwoman, dear, Not one true Englishwoman in the face, If I, a coward, fled my proper doom. These are the breezes where is duty high, This is the cool wind; if I e'er returned Coward to England, I should surely find The sun, the scorching heaven, the hot wind there. The breeze in summer would be hell's hot fumeâ The smell of grass the savour of the fires Of hell, and every woman's glance, unknowing, Would stab me like hell's dagger to the bone. For in their every glance, unconscious quite, I should see that last glance of yours, O Rose, Which, when the priestsâif I shall give you upâ Drag you away, will o'er your shoulder seekâ Yes, love, you cannot help itâseek out mine, And seek it with a last imploring lookâ The look that only a woman can bestow, And which once seenâbe eyes that cast it darkâ Or lightâyea, be the woman's body dark, Or white and splendidâso it be but thrown Into the eyes of some pale man behind, Must haunt and scourge and purge him till his deathâ And perhaps beyond death, through the meadows red Of hell, or snow-white asphodel in heaven. Tua-Tua.â I feel all English, and I feel all love! Now first I understand how love is fair, And how the perfect English heart can speak. Thou hast lifted me, my lover, by thy words, In this short space of time unto a height That all my girlish yearning never knew. Alone I wandered through the lonely woods, Amid the blossoms red and blossoms white, Pining, desiringâthrough the early days Before your face, a gleam of moonlight, cameâ Pining for something, but I knew not what; Desiring something, which I saw not how To reach; the gift is now within my armsâ 'Twas love I neededâlo! my love is here! Now am I standing higher than e'er before I, Dyak maid, the daughter of a king, Have stood; for I have stood upon the hills Of this our islandâlow, and topped by treesâ And watched the waving leagues of sultry blossoms Stretched far before meânow I stand else-whereâ I stand with thee upon an English cliff, And gaze not over blossoms, but the sea; I stand with thee upon an English cliff, And feel the cool wind lifting all my hair, As just now in thy thought it lifted thine. Far, far before me stretches the grey sea That thou hast told me ofâthe sweet grey sea, Grey as the eyes of maidens thou hast loved In England long before thy quick glance fell On dark-eyed Tua-Tua; but I am English; Lo! I am English; thou hast made me so! And, being English, being loved besides By thee, the English gold-haired ruddy Christ, The chains of all these gods, though I am bound In body, fall like snapped reeds off my heart And off my leaping spirit. I hold the Christ For lover now and kingâI scorn these gods. Chorus of Maidensâ She âhath spoken blasphemy;â drag her away Beyond all blossoms, beyond the day. Chorus of Priestsâ To regions fetid, far from the ray Of the light, where black fiends revel and stray. Chief Priest.â Hear us, O great godâhear us, I pray. Tua-Tua.â Before me stretches the wide sea's grey. Robert.â From a cliff we glance o'er an English bay. Tua-Tua.â But I am true. If thou wilt die, why I will die, And, with thee, on swift pinions fly Through the stars, through the sky Of blue. Robert (To the Chief Priest)â Take me lest she curse thy godâ Take me speedily. Lo! thy deity lusts for blood, Longeth greedily. Flesh and bones I give thy god, Give them readily. Tua-Tua.â Curseâ A shoutâEnter English Sailor;âThe Boatswain sings: [Boatswain] Strike the blackies right and leftâstrike them down; Hit their god up in that cleftâsmash his crown; Take those jewelsâ'tis no theft: go it, Brown. Chorus of Sailors.â Hit them hard and scatter them, English tarsâ Black backs shine better for crimson scars! Boatswain.â Come, my hearties, with a songâcome along; Loose the girlâhave a careâgive her air; Seize the priest. How the blacks show their backs! Chorus of Sailors.â Hit them hard and scatter them, English tarsâ Black backs shine better for crimson scars! Boatswain.â Hit them hardâdamn their talk and their chatter (Set the Captain freeâis he free?âno matter!) Now three cheers for the Queen, and the girl. Wipe your facesâhottish work, Thomas Earl! Chorus of Sailors.â Hit them hard and scatter them, English tarsâ Black backs shine better for crimson scars! Tua-Tua.â Tides from the English sea have reached us here. Robert.â Strange how rough voices can sound sweet and clear. Tua-Tua.â They are no voices, but thy sea's wild cheerâ Just as it breaks on thy wild cliff-sides sheer, So hath it surged for our deliverance, dear, Against the human rocks that hemmed us here. Come near. END OF SCENE. LOVE'S EARLY MUSIC. I.âTHE SONG OF THE BLACK-BROWN HAIR. All ye who care to a tale to list Of wonder of woman, and man's despair, Comeâhark to the tale that I love the best, Of my Alice's wonder of black-brown hair. Alice the beautiful! Alice the fair! Sweet lady of torment; clothed as a queen, With the sad, sweet tresses of black-brown hairâ The sweetest of any my eyes have seen. The sweetest crown that Love ever boreâ The black-brown tresses that come in the night; And, pouring about me, unite to pour A heavy-sweet perfume of vain delight. An odour that clothes me and wraps me around, Till I feel nought else in my mad delight And shiver of pulsesâas one in a swound Dreams rapturous visions till morning light. An odour of roses, and faintly fair With the faint sweet breath, and the balm of the night; The odorous odour of black-brown hair, That slays me, and makes me alive with might. The odour, as rich as the bright gorse-bloom, Flows through me and wraps me as vapour the stars; Yea, windeth around me as web of the loom; As a stream that ripples, as flame that chars. The manifold scents of the year of flowers Are gathered, and garnered, and made as one. The sweet scent mindeth of deep green bowers, Hot, and kissed, and blessed by the sun. The sweet scent mindeth of lonesome lakes, And autumn sunsets of green and grey, And the sea, with its ripple of luminous flakes, And the deep burnt odour of dying day. To bury my face in the black-brown hair That maddeneth me to think uponâ To tell thee once that thou art fair, And fling thee my heart to trample upon! To look right into the deep green eyes, And through them, and through themâand look yet againâ To sigh out my soul in a passion of sighs, As clouds outpour their burden of rain. To tell thee I love thee, and that thou art fair, Yea, fairer than roses, and soft as the dewâ And sweet, O sweetest, beyond compare, With a sweetness that thrilleth me through and through. To bury my face in the black-brown hair! The black-brown hair that I love so well! To bury therein my burden of care, And rise, well knowing that all is well. To bury my face in the black-brown hair; To anoint my face with its honey-soft smell! How madly I love it, song cannot declareâ How wildly I long for it, life cannot tell. To cool my cheeks in the black-brown hair; To swaddle it round me, and choke my sighsâ To wrap myself round with the black-brown hair, And bite it, and kiss itâand kiss your eyes. To kiss your eyes till I closed them, sweet; To kiss them hardly with hungry lips; To watch the torrent of passion's heat Tinge your sweet face to the eyelid tips. To kiss your eyes till I closed them, sweet; To kiss them open, and kiss them again; To kiss your lips till I hurt you, sweet, With clinging pleasure of panting pain. To bathe my face in the black-brown hairâ The black-brown hair that I love so well, That to win one lock of the black-brown hair, I would run, not walk, to the gates of hell. Yea, pass right through them, and scatter the flames, And trample the fires with bold bare feet; And face the devils, and face the flames, And face the fires, and face the heat. Yea, face the cold of the ice-cold lake, And hideous horror of ice-bound bands; Whom pity of Dante did forsake, From one sufferer whom he saw in hell, the great pitiful Dante turned without pity; an example not to be followed. Him would I gladden with heated hands. True sorrow the red flames cannot smotherâ True love hell's fierce blows cannot breakâ Love's tears shall deliver thy soul, my brother, From its ice-bound bands in the ice-cold lake. Though great the horror and hot the fires, That strive the heart of a man to shake; Yet stronger is love, and love's desires, And greater the cause that love has at stake. Love, who is sweet as a maid that advances, Can soothe as a maiden, and mould, and remake; Love, with his quiver of winged eye-glances, Can pierce to the depths of the ice-cold lake. Pale cowards I sought and kissed, and liars My soul in pity would not forsake; Methought a soul that had faced the fires, Might laugh at the cold of the ice-cold lake. O, black-brown hair that I love the best, Of all fair hair of women I've seen, The black is as black as a blackbird's breast, The brown is as bright as a thrush's wing. Nor only the hair, so tenderly fair, Shinesâall thy beauty, from foot to head, Leads on from afar, a white soft star, With rays o'er ripples of yearning shed. Thy form appeareth in dreams at night, With limbs that dazzle on every side; For each, as it seemeth to me, gleams white With a halo of passion glorified. O, sweet, warm dream, that endured for awhile, Then burst like a bubble, and left all dark, Could I reach you once, though death should defile My body, and leave it a shattered ark, I would gather my whole soul into a kissâ That kiss should show how I loved you, sweet; But my soul escaping, through too much bliss, Would leave me, I wot well, dead at your feet! Far in the far-away heights of the ether, Saileth my lady on outspread wings; I crawl, Ã¦ons and Ã¦ons beneath herâ A man that groanethâa maid that sings. I struggle to reach her, I strive to beseech her, Through ages pursuing the sound of her strain; Ages of horror and wild weird agony! Ages of agonyâÃ¦ons of pain! My lady I follow, with wings of a swallow, And feet as the swift sweet feet of a fawn; O'er highland and hollow, my lady I follow, From morn to twilight, from night till dawn. O'er mountain and hollow, with speed of a swallow, Full hard to follow, my lady hies; The feet that twinkle, sweet odours sprinkle, The better to trace her course as she flies. The sunset is gleaming, faint odours are streaming About the bier of the day now dead; My lady, like a soft ghost in seeming, Steers for the sunset of yellow and red. Ah! those pure shadows across the meadows, Bright clouds that cover the sun's gold head, The mystical west, by his warmth caressed, Is all on fire with orange and red. Strange colours that seem, as in some deep dream, To show forth passion, when passion is ripe: Wild tints that stay, at the close of the day, For love's pure image, for love's soft type. The love of a man is as red fierce fire; The love of a woman as flickering flame; The fire smouldersâthe flame leaps higher, As high as the heavens from whence it came. The happiness fadeth, my lady upbraideth, With words that are cruel (with looks that are sweet); I hurry me over fair fields of clover, That glitter with whiteness of vanishing feet. Her breath is sweeter, her beauty completer Than clover-blossoms the night winds beat; Her face is fairer, her cheeks are rarer Than roses; her hands are whiter than wheat. O lady of wonder, strong as the thunder, And brighter than brightness of lightning rays, With sweet short lips, now smiling asunder, Now puckered in petulant, pouting ways. Thou wilt not obey me! 'twere better to slay me! Without thy presence no life can endure! To die were pleasureâto suffer, sweet measure, To die, well-dying by hands that are pure. Yea, life were bitter, and death were fitter, Without thee; with thee, death were sweet! Lips lately laden with kisses of maiden, Are strong fires ready death's fires to meet! When soul and body are smitten in sunder, And life fails, slain by the fire from above; Will there be anything left I wonderâ Anything left us as luscious as love? Will there be anything perfect and painless? Joy without sadness, fire without flameâ Passion that rises imperial and stainlessâ Mirth without madness, love without shame? O, Death! O, reaper of days and hours! High on the hill-tops, deep in the mine; By garnering sons and daughters of ours, Daily developing muscle of thine! O, Death! what shall I say of thee? In this my song that a woman commands! How shall we wait thy coming? with gleeâ With laughter, like some spring flower that expandsâ Standing with eyes cast down to the groundâ Or sternly regarding the hour-glass sands, O, Death, our Brother?âand thus be found, Awaiting thy coming with folded hands. Ah! sweet, remember you dim green bowers, And a soft summer day long buried and dead; When I wove you a garland of meadow-sweet flowers, As a prize for your beautyâa crown for your head? I was but a poor wild swan, without noteâ To my breast your arrow-point did not clingâ But now I am stricken, and songs forth floatâ Then I was voiceless; now I can sing. I can sing of the vision of quivering lips, And hair that in ripples went and came; And a face that shone to the eyelid tips With lovely showers of passion's flame. I can sing of visions that flashed in the night Before meâwhereat the sick heart swims; Of draperies golden, and dimly white With a white revelation of gleaming limbs. And, since I can sing, as I could not of old, And tell all nations that thou art fair; Vouchsafe me a gift â no gift of goldâ Only a tress of the black-brown hair. Oh, since I can speakâyea, since I am bold, And able to sound sweet songs i' the air; Be kind, be pitifulâbe not cold, Vouchsafe me a lock of the black-brown hair. I need itâindeed, it has ever been told That a safeguard from evil is found in the rare Love-locks Love's finger doth linger to holdâ Oh, grant me a safeguard of black-brown hair. That, when I am wounded, or pale and surrounded By enemies whose eyes glitter and glare, That delicate tress may be near to redressâ That sure sweet safeguard of black-brown hair! And when I am dying, that lock may be lying, Still where you placed itâstill left there; That Death may be sure that a woman most pure Once found meâand crowned me with black-brown hair! Yea, this you may give meâyou've chosen to leave me, All elseâall softer delights, I miss. Grant me the hair; and, in heaven's high air, Grant me a rosebud; give me a kiss. This token of thine, which I long for and pine To possess, thou mayest give meâI crave but this Upon earth; in the sky be tender with thy Long, deep-drawn, deathless, universe-kiss! It shall make me amends for the folly of friends, It shall cure as a pure rose saves by its scent; It shall be unto me Christ's purity, And God's most merciful kindly intent. It shall be the blossom and beauty of thingsâ Divine sweet Alice, for thy soft kiss I will wait till fate at the golden gate Of heaven brings straight what seemed amiss. For I shall remember our sweet September For ever; I think thou wilt not forget; But in some far heaven thy soft eyes even With love of that old time may be wet. I part from thee here for many a year, With songs of sorrow, and words of regret, But, trust meânever shall Time's sword sever The golden thought of the joys we met. My labour shall find thee, my voice shall remind thee Of old hopes vanished, from time to time; My poems shall follow thee, with plumes of a swallow thee Seekingâwith ardours of valorous rhyme. In this life I yield thee; but 'tis but to shield thee The better; 'tis but to be free to proclaim To men that shall listen, soft eyes that shall glisten As thine eyes glistened, thine own sweet name. 'Tis but to make greater our pleasure later, When both our hearts and our minds have grown; Some spirit has told me that I shall enfold thee One day, my lost oneâbut still mine own. I feel, through the weary days, dismal and dreary, The far keen rapture of that embrace! Its far keen gloryâwhen life's dull story Is quickened, by thine imperial face. When the draperies golden, that flamed in the olden Soft dream, float lovingly close to mine; When thou art not holden in sorrow, embolden My comingâcall for me, lady divine! And I will be ready, my voice shall be steady, And all the airs around shall be sweet; To the dim soft bower of love's first hour We two will hasten, we twain will retreat. To the bright far meadows, where love's first shadows Fellâand crossed, and were tossed round our feet; To that far glad ocean, whose amorous motion Combined and twined with our bosoms' beat. And there we will linger; I, the singer, Thou the singer's glory and crown; And all life's labour, and life's red sabre, In those far meadows I will lay down. For I only care for thee, and for singingâ I care not for pleasure, I heed not the toys To which the hands of the crowd are clingingâ I seek not the common inglorious joys. Treasures of silver, treasures of gold, Fair hair of women, and crowns of kings, And all that the earth's great granaries hold Of fruitful flavour of precious things. The wonders carven by cunning of toolâ The herds that bellow, the flocks that bleatâ And wealth of cotton, and wealth of wool, And wonderful waving wealth of wheat. I would fling them all to the winds, my sweet,â The winds that scatter, the winds that tear,â For one short half-hour to sit at thy feet, And twine sweet roses in black-brown hair! For one short half-hour to feel the passion Course and flow through our veins as of oldâ To twine thy locks in lover's fashionâ Plait upon soft plait, fold upon fold. To know that never may chill time sever The hearts of lovers once made one: That the sorrow is over: that rover to rover Clingsâthat agony's task is done. As with one spirit to claim and inherit All that God the King can provide, All treasures of earth in a world-wide mirth To gather together, for bridegroom and bride. To know that pure love, by the power from above, Has conquered all barriers cast between: To feel that thy soul, not a part, but the whole, Is for ever my darling, for ever my queen. To kiss thee at last, when our trouble is past, With tenderness like God's tender embrace: To pour my eyes, like God's glance from the skies, Through the depths of thy spirit, the deeps of thy face. Together carest, to be tranquil and blestâ No more to trembleâno more to yearn: In one long sigh together to dieâ In one long rapture God's peace to earn! It is this, it is this, O holiest kiss, That in the end thy calm shall achieveâ Together, sweet Alice, love's uttermost chalice In God's high palace, at life's soft eve, We shall drink, and the pure high joy shall endure, And among the angels queenly and fair, The foremost of all, white, passionate, tall, Shall be crowned, as a woman, with black-brown hair. II.âPASSION'S MYSTICISM. Of manhood's fierce addresses, and womanhood's caresses; Of sultry summer sunshine, and the winds of spring; For those that follow after, a tale of tears and laughter, A tale of joy and sorrow, I will set myself to sing. Once in time I met a woman, queenliest queen of all things human, Queen of earth and queen of ocean, queen of fire and queen of air; Before her bent my being, bowed in uttermost devotion,â The crown of all things beautiful, the fairest of the fair. My darling, O my sweet one; if I never may possess you, Let me greet you on the paper with blown kisses of my rhymes; Let me still the frantic longing but to see you and caress you, By fancying sweet lip-kisses, pressed a thousand, thousand times! Oh, I long for herâI seek her! in the night-time I am dreaming Of the tresses that elude me, and the hands that fly by day! Yearning to embrace the fickle, hopeless fancies round me streaming! Craving to possess and clasp and press the ghost to which I pray! To inform her with mine image! to feel her flowing through me With softly soothing current of electrical delight! Absorbed into each other, ghostly sisterâghostly brother, Phantom mixing into phantom, wedded spirits of the night! As a smoke-wreath writhes and eddies, so her being writhes around meâ Clasps my body, clasps my spirit, clasps my fancy, clasps my mind; Till my brain, instead of thinking, sits deliriously drinking Deepest death-draughts of emotion, making deaf and dumb and blind. So I swoon on for ever, without shadow of endeavour, As a passively-receiving image well content to serve: While her presence winds about me, stealing stealthily throughout meâ Wakening musical re-echo of response in every nerve. Yielding up, without resistance, individual existence, With every gate of being thrown wide open to receive, First, a consciousness of Aliceâsecond, of the great world-palace, With its rainbow-rippling echoesâin full triumph I achieve. As a river to the ocean, with mute majesty of motion, Rolls the river of her consciousness convolving into mineâ And our consciousnesses plighted, in a bridal band united, Roam from region unto region, a world-consciousness to twine. In a vision laid before me, as in German mystic story, Lying naked, bare and open, the world-mystery I see; Sweeping through my eyelid portals, rush the loves and hates of mortals, Rush the loves of man and woman, past and present and to be. In a moment, in a twinkling, as if from magic sprinkling Of wondrous magician, fall the scales from off my eyes; Roofs of houses are uplifted, and partition-walls are shifted, And the people are transparent, and dim worldvisions rise. Even such a mighty waking, from the love of thee is shaking Its glorious powers throughout meâfrom the love of one sweet soul, With majesty and terror, revealing every error, Unfolding every beautyâno portion, but the whole. A VISION IN HYDE PARK. As an exiled mountaineer desires, When he marks the old familiar horn, The mountain-palace of his sires, And the vine-clad slope where he was born, The yellow leagues of wind-swept corn, And the old wide flames of beacon-fires: As his foot pauses in the street, And all his being halts and thrills, At the unforgotten music sweet, That so pervades and shakes and fills His soul with the savour of the hills, And the sense of countless fields of wheatâ And some one on the mountain side, Waiting to give him welcome softâ Ah! that old face of a dead bride, That even here in London oft Shines out so clear, he stares aloft And fancies that she has not died! So all my memory hurries back To one strange nightâthe moon was full, And brightly gleamed across the track, And silvered many a silent pool; The gentle winds were slight and cool, And hardly made the branches crack. And then I saw my first love shine Resplendent as a rising star That moves along the ocean-line, And flames in glory from afar, With red wheels and a red-lipped carâ Or burns behind the mountain pine. I understood the clear white truth, And all the power and zeal of itâ And the rose-flushed passion of my youth Was as a cometâand it lit The town, and its long splendour hit The peaks of every tower in sooth. And all the past was clear before The wondrous face of that strange light: Again we wandered on the shoreâ And the perfume of a northern night Passed daintily our spirits o'er, And every place was bright. And then it vanished; and I knew That I was in a London park: Behold, the wintry sky was blue! Behold, the wintry streets were dark! And the moon was only a red spark, And my dream was not true. But yet I worship that wild dream, And the splendour manifold That poured along the streets a beam Of molten luscious gold, Although I only hold One thin remembered gleam. THE ROSE WILL BLOSSOM NONE THE LESS. The rose will blossom none the less, When I am lying dead and cold, The summer breeze will still caress Its petals as of old. The pure white lilies still will shine Along the quiet lanes, though I No more their tender stalks may twine, For Nature cannot die. The green grass still will glitter through The woodsâthe ferns will still be sweet With morning and with evening dew, Though no morn I may meet. Lovers will wander through the woods, And twine bright tendrils in their hair, And laugh from under blossomy hoodsâ But I shall not be there. Soft lips will cling, and smile, and kiss, Soft hands will join with tender glee, Glad with the old impassioned bliss Of love;âI shall not see. Nature is pitilessâshe spurns The individualâthen bestows On others that for which he yearns, Nature no mercy knows. Each year the fresh bright buds begin Their lovely spotless reignâthe flowers Their various hues and odours win, But where are last year's bowers? Yea, where are last year's lovers? Where Are all the lips we found so sweet, The golden wind-waved wealth of hair, Bright as the wind-waved wheat? Where are the joys that came and fled, Where are the birds that sang and flew, Where are the roses that were red, The hare-bells that were blue? Where are the grasses that were green, Where are the lilies that were white, Where are the moons that swam serene Through cloven tides of night? Where are the whispers that we heard, In love's soft summer weather, when The leaves were loud with many a bird, As we were lute-voicedâthen? Where is the meadow-sweet I found, To twine within your dark-brown hair? The summer grass that hid the ground, And those soft fern-frondsâwhere? Where are you now? Where are the days So full of hope, so full of glee; Where are my first impassioned lays That mingled with the sea? Where are my early eager songs, Where are the early wild desires; Where are the thoughts that leaped in throngs Across fast-smitten lyres? Where are the bays that once were green? Alas! they are withered and burnt brown; Nothing remaineth that hath been, No garland, and no crown. Fresh flowers shall bloom beside the way, Fresh summers smileâfresh lovers too, When I am old and worn and grey, But all these shall be new! Not one bud of the buds we saw, Shall spring and bloom for us again; Suchâsuch is Nature's piteous law, Her gift of constant pain. Her gift of constant change and growth, For, lest the world be over full, She hath the bitter mission both To plant and to up-pull. She hath no mercy in her hands, She hath no pity in her voice; She bid leth all the verdant lands Bud, blossom and rejoice. And then when autumn comes she shakes The wild red leaves upon the air, And hurls them o'er the rustling brakes, Like jewels from her hair. The fierce red leaves fly far and wide, O'er autumn fields and autumn hills, Like cast-off jewels of a bride, Whose heart some sorrow chills. And then a new spring comes again, And all the green young leaves are there, Without a trace of death or pain, Nature rebinds her hair. But when we closelier look we find That every bud is wholly new, Nature was over-rich to bind Again the leaves that flew Adown the autumn in her locksâ She must have flowers that never more Shall glitter 'mid the woods and rocks, And never shone before. So let us find a sad content In yielding to her bitter ways, When hope and youth and joy are rent From us, then let us raise Our eyes towards future joys that some Shall know, but which we shall not see. Again the laughing spring shall comeâ Again the red-rose tree. Again sweet lovers shall traverse The sacred, silent groves we knew; Soft secrets these in turn shall nurse, In hearts as soft and true. These I address my song toâthese Whom perhaps my struggling voice may reach, As a far wind 'mid distant trees, Or faint waves on a beach. I like to feel that some may read These words when I am long since dead, And see that as their hearts do bleed, A buried heart once bled; And know that as their living souls Rejoice and laugh on summer days, I once rejoiced and laughedâtheir bowls Of gladness I could raise. I like to feel that they may say To one another, âWould that we Alive in this our meagre day Could be as dead as he, âIf but we might with plaintive song Secure our tender loves from death, And mix them in a current strong With the Eternal's breath; âSending a living music past Our graves that surely are to be, A song that mixes with the blast, That floats upon the sea. âThus blending our lives with the flowers Of summers sleeping yet unborn Amid the future's mountainous bowers, Thus mingling with the morn âWhose crimson cloud-ranks from afar We watch forâthus made one with those Who walk 'neath many a future star, Made one with many a rose. âMade one with many a linnet too, And many a yellow-breasted thrush, And many a lark who climbs the blue, And many a bending rush âIn many a bright-green future lake, By many a soft and grassy shoreâ Thus able their joys to partake, Although we live no more. âAble to sip the lips of love, And thrill soft bosoms with our song, And quicken hearts our numbers move, And make the doubting strong. âAble to rest in tender hands, Though we ourselves have past away Into pale flowerless scentless lands Of languor and decay.â I like to feel that thus may speak Some future readers of these lines, Looking towards some far mountain peak, Or trellised hill of vines. And, thinking thus, the very gift Of which they speak I seem to know; Wide plumes of pleasure I uplift, Wide pinions, white as snow. And, no more, sorrow comes to me Because the rose will blossom still When I have long since ceased to beâ Rather a rapturous thrill To think that perhaps a song or two Of mine may yet outlive the rose, And still be found a blossom new, When spring's bloom fades and goes. To think that perhaps a word of mine May have more durance than the thrush, More power of lasting than the vine, More vigour than the rush. To think that perhaps my voice may sound To future lovers sitting where Once for my love's own locks I wound White flowers as sweet and fair. To think that perhaps a poet's life Is not the brief and hollow thing Death severs with his wayward knife, But gifted with a wing To rise and hover o'er the grave: So let the rose bloom none the less, And let the dim grey willows wave, And let the winds caress New flowers when I am dead and gone; If but one passionate tune shall live, That tune shall bid my spirit wan A lively joy receive. If but one maiden weeps for me, Yea, but one single tender tear, That pearl shall pierce triumphantly The black forbidding bier And change into a white roseâthis, This boon I shall not fail to see; And that white flower shall bring the bliss Of ample heaven to me! TO MAZZINI TRIUMPHANT. 1 At last, our brother, thou hast left the land Of trouble and of sorrow and dismay, And joined thy harp to the ecstatic band, Whose voices and whose glad lyres sing alway In regions where God's presence is as day; The countenance so dear to every soul Who fought for hope, for freedom, and the grey City by which the waves of Tiber roll, Now vanishes from earthânow shines at heaven's high goal. 2 Would that I had the harp from Shelley's hand, The solemn voice of Miltonâand his sight Nurtured on heavenly visions sweet and grand, The more so for the absence of the light Common, in which the common earth is dight; Would that I had the voices of all singers, And all their palms, and robes of lustrous white, That I might fit the chant that in me lingers To words less weak and frail, with more auspicious fingers! 3 Would that I had the reed whose swift point sang Of paradise, and heaven's heights, and of hell, From which the immortal soul of the era rang: For, truly, things as great are ours to tell, With whom in these last ages it is well; Yea, things as vast to sing with a sonorous And wide-mouthed trump, or softly-cadenced shellâ The beauty of the mother-age that bore us, And many a flaming star borne perilously o'er us. 4 For inspiration is not dead; it seeks The worthy presence of a worthy bard, Then with a glorious rose inflames his cheeks! He cometh; but the slow time doth retard His labour, and surrounding ice is hard For any, even a trumpet-blast, to melt, And dark-plumed foes fame's golden turrets guard, And in the mid way iron blows are dealt, And many iron shocks that singer shall have felt. 5 The singer whom we see not, but who stands Most surely at the gateway of the time, With might and risen power within his hands, And all a sun's fresh brilliance in his rhyme; Loud as the thunder in its organ-chime, Yet soft as the sweet speaking of a girl Fed upon fairy tales and lore sublime, Who laughs, sweet-shaking many a golden curl, At dexterous fairy-tales of palaces of pearl. 6 So sweet and yet so strong shall be the diction Of the great singer soon about to be; He shall disdain the haunts of ancient fiction, And ancient iron-armoured revelry, And tales of knights who struggled knee to knee, For he shall mark before him in the fighting Of the wide peoples, and the foaming sea Of present thought, a subject grand, delighting His fiery spiritâall the paler epochs blighting. 7 Casting himself with faith and sweet persuasion Into the yeasty channel of our days, And seizing each fair opportune occasion, He shall achieve as bright a crown of bays, With as divine a worship of those sprays, As any who in previous epochs drew The people with the fervour of their lays; Laurels were theirs, rose-clusters not a fewâ But round his brow shall flame the stars within the blue. 8 And thou, Mazzini sweet, hast paved the way! Saint John thou art to this fair coming bard, Singing with blameless heart thy prose-clad lay. Him all the icy seasons do retard, The spring breathes feebly, and earth's frost is hard; Our glad inwreathed redeemer comes not yet, Not yet the face shines, wonderful tho' marred, By no green hill-side may his steps be met, His footprint presses not the wandering mignonette. 9 But, our Mazzini, thou hast made the path Easier, for where thy lonely soul hath bled, Pierced either by false friends' or prelates' wrath, Soft flowers, impurpled with that living red, Along the lonely way a radiance shedâ Where thou hast groaned, birds have caught up the note And hurl it transformed round about the head Of each who, following with swift soul, both float Along the self-same way as in pursuing boat. 10 Easier it is for Christ, O great Saint John, When comes the approaching healer of our age, To put his healing store of garments on, And open out a less tempestuous page Of Being;âthou, interpreter and sage, Hast gone before, and all the path is ready, And the fierce elements less madly rage, And less oppressive is the devious eddy Of priestcraft, and the true stand stronger and more steady. 11 Therefore we worship with religious awe, Mazzini, thy fair spirit, that has past The wood-side beyond which man never saw. We cannot follow yet; desire is fast, Both fleet of foot and wing, but earth's sad blast Has yet to be endured a little while, A little longer with faint fluttering mast Life's vessel through foam-heaps the black winds pile, Surges and toilsânot yet the cliff-top meadows smile! 12 But, happy soul, it is not so with thee; Thy strife is ended, and thy banner waves Beyond that bitter, foam-encircled sea; Beyond the cold domain of clay and graves Thou art, and all thy spoken message saves, Even as the Comforter from Christ was sent To comfort those who, hidden in deep caves And lonely forests, by fierce anguish rent, Held to the blood-stained road by which their Master went. 13 That glorious season doth return to us: And, as the first brave Christians did endure All tortures for truth's sake, and triumphed thus, With simple hearts that perished for the pure, So, in this unreturning age, be sure, Fresh tortures of the spirit, many and strange, Some which time softens, some past mortal cure, Await the unflinching ones whose thought would range, Impassioned o'er the hills or trackless tides of change. 14 But through the sorrow, brother, thou hast journeyed; Harder than we fight hath thy spirit fought; With actual steel lances thou hast tourneyed, Into which conflict we have not been brought: Yet all the horror of lonely tears and thought Is not a small thing, is it, brother mine? These present birth-pangs, are they all for nought? Or shall we, at our own life's ending, twine Sweet laurels of glad victory, perfect even as thine? 15 This, this we know, that one of us emerges With triumph from the terror and the pangs Of life, even as a diver from thick surges Is risenâwhile his iron armour clangs Around him, and, victorious, he harangues His fellows, telling of the depth profound, And rocky hollows, and of sharks' keen fangs, And scarlet flowers whose clusters interwound Glitter among the stones, in gorgeous masses bound. 16 So, from the horrors of the trembling deep, Mazzini rises into heavenly air, And regions wherein yet we may not peep, But which, we know, the eternal blossoms bear; His load of life-long sorrow and of care Is lifted, and he passes towards the crown That he alone of patriot hearts can wear: Peace cometh; he may put the good steel down, And rest for evermore, secure in his renown. 17 Fair risen spirits round him stand; but none Is greater than the dead man who doth rise With perfect hands and forehead like the sun, And all Italia's future in his eyes, Wherein the vast unspoken passion lies: The crown he weareth no soul touched before, Virgin it is, yet dewy from the skies That break triumphantly above the shore For which his untold pain he, pain-defying, bore. 18 To all the prophets great who have preceded His equal course, he is united now; To Milton, who gave light that England needed, Although it wandered from his darkened brow To illume a wider field; to all who vow Their lives to freedom; most of all to those Who guided through the waters the sweet prow Of fair Italia's vessel as it rose On the white waves it flung aside like scattered snows. 19 To Shelley, and to him whom Shelley mourned In that sweet song wherethrough all music sighs, Is our Mazzini's snow-white soul returned, Even as a lark reseeks the voiceless skies From which he fell, with fresh soliloquies; Shelley and Adonais and the great Italian with the forehead crowned and wise, And all his country's thorn-wreathed martyrs, wait To welcome this new king, beside his palace-gate. 20 But most of all to Christ, I see him draw, With the same pure God-breathing presence nearâ I mark their meeting, but with sacred awe, And somewhat in me yet of earthly fear, I do retreat from words I may not hear; Their faces are too bright for me to seeâ But yet their far-off voices ringing clear, Suffice as in a dream to bring to me Visions of earth made glad with hours of purity. 21 They speakâso much I gather through my dreamâ Of all that shall be when the earth is white, And through its plains swift tides of blessing stream; When as a cloud by day, a fire by night, In every heart God restsâwhen man's pure might At length accomplished is, and man is crowned With his own soul's unutterable light: When all the prisoners whom the ages bound With bitter bands at length in liberty are found. 22 They speak of that fair season when the spirit Of man, so shackled through the ages long, Shall, like themselves, stride forward and inherit The lands he covets with desire so strong, But which he cannot reach by sword or song As yet, not being pureâbut he shall find A pathway at the last from every wrong, And all earth's blossoms round his brow shall bind, And stand forth as a king invincible in mind. 23 The stars shall be his servants, and the hills No tardy lingering tribute then shall payâ His foot shall be upon the foaming rills, His forehead shall be bright with ocean-spray; Along the eddying wind his words shall strayâ The incarnate God in manhood then shall dwell, All nature shall be subject to his sway, Earth, heaven, and all the deep of fiery hellâ Plains, rivers, sands and shoresâeach glade and grassy dell. 24 His spirit shall be paramountâimperial He shall be over all the world of things: This he shall rule by conquest sure; ethereal And white shall be the glitter of his wingsâ His crown more golden than the crowns of kings, His heart more steadfast than the fickle hearts Of gods whose thrones time having raised now flings Downward, unsheathing pitiless keen dartsâ Laughing as each pale god in emptiness departs. 25 The lonely night shall be a fitting wreath For himâthe stars shall cluster round his browâ Victor he shall be o'er the pains of death. The winds and crested ocean-waves shall vow Allegiance, and before his sceptre bow; Upon the mountains when the morn is red, Strange snowy glittering heights untrodden till now, The conquering foot of man their lord shall tread: His spirit shall converse with the unforgotten dead. 26 Woman, no more a subject, but a queen, Shall be the fairest rose within his bower, The sweetest the desirous years have seen: O, whitest most unfathomable flower, Whose petals soft eternal fragrance shower, At length, at length, thine heart hath victory! Yea, now at last the immeasurable hour When thy pure triumph with glad eyes we see, Rejoicing too with souls that worship utterly. 27 Beyond all speech the triumph of the tender Pure woman-heart that then the years shall bring: All foes who have resisted shall surrenderâ All friends she shall reward with snow-white wing: Thee, sweet, sweet, future goddess I would singâ Thee and thy crown of fair undying roses Whose buds thy far more spotless forehead ring Thee and thine empire that slow time discloses, As time all other realms, imperious, opposes. 28 I see thee, woman, as thou shalt be surely When the great day of thine empire shall comeâ I see thee stepping towards thy throne demurely, With all thy face flushed into happy bloom: Gone are the years of terror and of gloomâ Man equal partner in thy perfect joys With thee the boundless empire shall resume: I hear above the waves' and wild winds' noise Thy laughter, and the ringing of thy silver voice! 29 Oh beautiful thou artâmore fair, O lady, In that thou thus hast suffered through time's night, Threading the obscure dark hills and valleys shady With patient step that travelled towards the light, Implacable in unassuming might: More lovely art thou for the years so long Wherein thou hadst not grown to woman quite, Not yet wast moulded perfectly, nor strongâ Sweeter thy now mature illimitable song. 30 I see thee and I sing theeâand I see The wide-spread glory that shall soft descend Upon the earthâthe wonder that shall be When folly slain by truth's spear, hath an endâ Ah! the swift golden wheels of progress tend Resistlessly along the impassioned road, Till with the far-off summer skies they blend Wherein the sunrise of mankind hath glowed, True to the golden joy that poets' visions showed. 31 I see the hope of every patriot finished, The dream of every sorrowing bard complete; The altar of earth's prayers is undiminished, But each petition, with exalted feet, Has sought the inmost chamber-hollows sweet Wherein God sits to answer; He doth spurn No single flame of sacrificial heat; He gathers all desires of souls that yearn, And presently each hope shall, magnified, return. 32 God gathers all our hearts into His bosom; They rise like scentless lilies wan and pale; He doth return them as the blood-red blossom Of some superb rose that might proudly sail Upon a woman's breast; our mingled wail Is melody if heard from out the sky, Even from behind the Holy Temple's vail, Whereto through paths of misery we fly, Ascending to our homes, God's palaces on high. 33 So much I learned; but then the Italian vision Of joy and beauty on my spirit broke; As the green earth doth bound from winter's prison, Spurning with laughter every icy yoke, A liberated universe then spoke; I marked the re-united shores of nations; The passion of the re-united folk Brought incense and immaculate oblations Of fruitful hearts to God as happy protestations. 34 The sounds of prayer were common; yet no churches Usurped the grim protection of a creed; The wings of white prayers fluttered through the birches, And pure petitions blossomed in each mead; No longer do our poet-martyrs bleed, For truth is worshipped, reverenced everywhere. The spirit of truth doth calmly take the lead, All hearts are free as freest mountain air, All souls of men are white, made exquisitely fair. 35 And, fairest of all lands, I saw thine own, Mazzini, rising softly from the waste Of many a scattered church and vanquished throne; Like some pure island on the waters placed By hands of a creating God in haste Thy country gleamed, superb with many towers, Grand with the endless city that hath graced The avenues of time, and furnished flowers Of beauty to adorn the universe's bowers. 36 At last, Mazzini, thou art understood! Thy passion, and thy valour, and thy love. Thou art not veiled with any paltry hood; Thy spirit, rich with the presence of the dove Of holiness, is visible above The Rome that shall be; therein thou art praised By every poet through whose fancy move Numbers majestic with delight; high raised Thou art where once the fires of persecution blazed. 37 We pray thee help us; we are puzzled sorely, Hard bound by clanking fetters of the age,â We struggle, we aspire, succeeding poorly, Down-stricken by the adamantine rage Of elements we know not how to assuage; But thou art treading some soft, flowery mead, Or turning some fresh philosophic page Of heavenly knowledge;âhelp our souls in need; Be present as a god to save and intercede. 38 Be present with us; let thy trusty spirit Visit not only Italy, thine own, But do thou, in sweet sympathy, inherit Salt shores by alien, fiercer breezes blown, Inhabited by tribes of hoarser tone; Our England gave thee refuge; guide us on Through struggle, sorrow, frailty, many a groan; Until our great contentment shall have shone, And we may reach the country whither thou art gone. 39 Our England boasts a noble race of singers, Our England in the time that doth draw near,â The age that shall be present, though it lingers, Making away with every sword and sneer, And doubtful, sick presentiment of fear, Shall play a noble part; her bards shall speak The spring-tide message of the worldly year, As from some pale prophetic mountain-peak, Upon the which they wait,âwith flame upon each cheek. 40 The summer of the planet shall be sounded From Italyâthy land, thy love, thine own; Thy love that soared, exceeded, and abounded, Shall be re-gathered into richer tone When Italy's red, liberal rose is blown, For great Italian poets shall arise Even sweeter than the flute of Dante flown Towards flowery hollows of celestial skies; Great prophets of intense, unfathomable eyes. 41 The spirit of Italy shall find a measure, The summer of the future shall pervade The land God granted as a perfect treasure Of sunlight to the lands He set in shade; By river and by sunny nook and glade The triumphs of Italia shall be counted; Like some white-breasted, flower-engirdled maid, Upon the white steed of her freedom mounted, She shall be seen; the fangs of priestcraft shall be blunted. 42 The central God shall speak through many voices, Through women, and through young men, or a childâ When all the fragrant bridal-room rejoices, Rich with faint perfumes as of roses piled, Or savours of broad meadows undefiled, God shall be there; and every bride shall know it, Revealing God's breast in her bosom mild, Not needing an inspired high-priest to show it, Nor any voice of sage, nor love-disclosing poet. 43 O grand Mazzini, such a season waits us; I see it dimly, and I strive to sing The coming pleasurable time that mates us To this divine soul of a lovely thing; Already do the buds of roses cling To the sweet casementâall the buds are swellingâ The fields are laden with the odorous spring,â And, in accordance, I would be foretelling Love's spring in numbers sweet most softly upward welling. 44 The hyacinths will soon bedeck the corners Of many a happy and most fragrant wood; Why should the sons of men be perjured mourners, When bridal blossoms, rich for many a rood, Join happy voices in their solitude? Self-sacrifice provides to human sorrow A key, and this was thy perpetual mood, And therefore do we softly seek to borrow At thy most sacred tomb gifts fitted for the morrow. 45 We do not wait to see thy body rise, As once disciples lingered at a tomb, With mournful tear-drops in their down-cast eyes,â We do not look to see the perfect bloom Of risen Mazzini issue from the gloom, As once disciples said that Jesus leapt From spent hell-fires that struggled to consume In vain,âas once again the same eyes wept Before them, or the voice thrilled through them as they slept. 46 We do not look to see our hero enter, With visible body, a rent heaven of blue, Dividing as an arrow swift the centre Of that stupendous azure dome we view, Cleaving its sounding hollows through and through With dazzling wings of passionate desire And pearly radiance and impurpled hue. We add no colours to the sun-set fire; Crowned with the simple light of morning, we aspire. 47 The cheeks of death are white; that pale rose hovers Softly upon the features of the dead, Softly upon pale women who had lovers, Whose cheeks were once thrice kissed to roses red, Whose rich lips bloomed, though now the bloom hath fled; Death's white flower covers these with tender petals, Above the rich departing crimson shed; And weâwe seek not with invention's nettles To spoil the eternal peace that round the still brow settles. 48 God places on the dead His solemn palm, As a white, pure, imperishable rose, Imperishable in a fragrant calm; And weâwe strive not madly to unclose The petals that His tender hands dispose Upon the corpse, august in its new sleep; But over it God's sacred blossom blows, And unintelligible tears we weep, But not for sorrow's sakeâfor something e'en more deep. 49 For death is unto us as something deeper, More holy, than it seemed to men before; The dead man is a voluntary sleeper Upon God's breastâwe cannot, as of yore, A risen, pallid Lazarus implore, But rather, with a love too deep for speech, The quiet dust to quiet dust restore, Knowing that the departed soul shall reach Beyond the waves of death the bright immortal beach. 50 Sure that he labours in some sinless mansion, It may be 'mid the measureless white air, Or in some vast, ecstatic brain-expansion Of all the slow, yet wondrous, powers that were,â Tedious to him, yet excellently fair, With due regard to whence he, perhaps, had risen, As from a dark and mist-clothed valley-lair Into a mountain-ether; from a prison Unto a palace steps each man, from fate to vision! 51 But into higher regions steps the dead:â And thither, O our Leader, thou art gone, With sacred, unpolluted human head; Beyond death's mountains a new sun has shone, Tipping the previous summits faint and wan As with a light insufferably pure: O brother, has not some pure-breasted swan Of soft Italian loveliness been sure At last to heal the soul that nobly did endure? 52 Upon the earth thou wast a lonely man, Thou art not, I am certain, lonely now. A solitary honour is the van Of battle, or of thought! a lonely brow For certain that which doth allegiance vow To purposes unfathomed by the frail And fickle herd, who understand not how One passion, vast, imperishable, pale With its most intense life, may garb a man in mail. 53 Driving him surely from the grassy meadows Of daisy-flecked, harp-haunted common life, Towards the mute and scentless mountain-shadows: Towards some unsearchable, sequestered strife; So that he severs with religious knife The bonds that tie him to the common soul, For his soul with a secret voice is rife, And o'er his spirit secret whispers roll, Urging him fiercely on towards many a viewless goal. 54 But, brother, I am certain that the passion, Pent-up, misunderstood, imprisoned long, Has mixed in some celestial, fearless fashion, With the soft music of a woman's song; Thine heart of love was tender, yet most strong, But it was wholly given to Italyâ Or so it seemed to usâbut we were wrong! Some personal passion thou shalt surely see, Who didst on earth adore, in utter purity. 55 The sacred kiss of Italy, most pleasant, Is printed on thy dead, heroic brow, But with some perfect spirit thou art present, Some soft embodiment of Italy, now, Who shall reward theeâah! we know not how, Being with remnants of the body blind; Some woman, the fruition of thy vow, Thy spotless manhood shall most surely find, Who through thy thorn-crowned hair love's blossom-wreath shall wind. DEATH OR YOU. (âNight or Blucher.â Wellington at Waterloo.) âNight or Blucher!â O'er the blood-stained field, Through the stress and strain of Waterloo Sounds the cry of him who would not yieldâ And my cry is, sweetheart, Death or you! Through the terror and the stress of life, âDeath or youâ is ever on my lipsâ Hear me, sweetestâhear me, perfect wifeâ Help me through our love-sun's dark eclipse. âNight or Blucher!â Death or you, my sweet! Which, I wonder, which, would help me mostâ Sound of some one's gentle helpful feet, Or Queen Death, the gentle helpful ghost? Be that as it mayâforth sounds my cryâ Death or youâupon the midnight breezeâ Oh, God, helpâlove, help me, for I die, Smitten by slow piercing agonies! âNight or Blucher!â Ah, the day was hot, Cool and full of hope the even seemedâ Help was on its swift march to the spotâ Of that help or night the Leader dreamed. Surely all my day of fiercest pain Equals or surpasses Waterlooâ Surely through the anguish and the strain, I may sigh forth, sweetheartâDeath or you. TO THEE, LOVE. For this our happy day, love, What tribute shall I bring, What word of pleasure say, love, What wreath upon thee fling? What song without delay, love, Shall I, thy poet, sing. Oh, shall it be a rose, love, With petals bright and red, Through which my passion glows, love, In which my heart has bled, A perfect flower which shows, love, What passion would have said? Or lily sweet and white, love, And pure as is thine heart? A perfume, a delight, love, To leave when we must part, Though only for a night, love, (But one night brings its smart!) Or violet blue and tender As all thy thoughts of meâ A subtle blossom-splendour In which the soul may see What Love's own God may render In some futurity! Say what is it to be, love,â O blossom of my soul, What blossom can I see, love, What flower so perfect, wholeâ I choose and gather, thee, love, The flower whose heart I stole. I send thee thine own heart, love, A blossom rendered back, Made perfect by mine art, love, With scent that it did lack, When passion was apart, love, And joy not on the track. This flower I choose and send, loveâ Oh, dream of it to-nightâ Dream of me, without end, love, And when the sleeping sight New vision doth extend, love, Come to me, my delight! Come to me; seek and find me; We are apart by day: The suns of daytime blind me With piercing loveless ray; Thou art my moon assigned meâ Oh, gleam upon my way! Thou art my star of even, To light my lonely trackâ My star in bluest heaven, To guide to God's throne back, To lift and to enliven, To guard from foes' attack. Thou art my own white beautyâ Thou comest in the night, Treading love's flowers for booty Beneath thy footing light, Giving me dreams of duty, Nerving my soul with might. Thou art my blossom white, love, Whose beauty undefiled By the sweet wholesome sight, love, Has made me as a child, With eyes and forehead bright, love, No more with misery wild. Thou art my blossom red, loveâ My rose of pure perfume, Lifting a gracious head, love, Above the abolished tomb; The strength thy petals shed, love, Death's kingdom shall consume. Thou bringest unto me, love, The glory of the air Of summerâand the sea, love, Within thine eyes is fairâ And black night owes to thee, love, The blackness of her hair. All glory I can find, love, Within thy white sweet soul, All pleasures of the mind, love, All love-joyâeven the whole. To ecstacy resigned, love, I touch love's utmost goal. Be ever with me, white love, At evening and by dayâ Be unto me my bright love, My sweet moon's rising rayâ Endue me with thy might, loveâ Come to my heart, and stay. Let all thy fulness pour, love, In passion through my veins; Be Queen as once of yore, love, On southern sunstruck plains, When we heard the lions' roar, love, And rustle of hot rains. When ere this life began, love, We loved and kissed and clungâ A woman and a man, love, By shafts of passion stungâ When you were sweet and wan, love, And I was fierce and young. When you were like a flower, love, And I was like the sky, Or like a perfumed bower, loveâ Fragrant when thou wert nigh, When passion in its power, love, Swept on us from on high. When we in valleys green, love, Kissed, and our lips were full Of ecstacy serene, love, And all the airs were cool;â Such passion ours hath been, love, Such passion-grapes to pull. By all the sweet old days, love, Hear thou my song to-night; By passion's burning rays, love, And the old moon's subtle lightâ By love's heaven-kindled blaze, love, Yea, by thy breast most white. By all these wondrous things, love, I pray thee that thou hear The passion-song which sings, love, Itself within thine ear To-nightâthe chant which brings, love, Thy lover's strong heart near. Were but my heart a rose, love, That rose I would bestow Just as it burns and glows, love, Upon thee; but I know Not where the flowers repose, loveâ My flowerless heart I throw. A flower beside thy feet, love, A flower for thee to wear Perhaps not all unsweet, love, A red rose in thine hair: Strong passion's bloom is meet, love, For nights of summer air. The smaller flowers would fade, love, At summer's burning kissâ My heart is not afraid, loveâ I fearless, give thee this. A flower reared in no shade, love, But under noontide bliss. And grant me in return, love, The flower for which I long, The bloom for which I burn, love, With passion pure and strongâ The heart for which I yearn, love, Which blossoms in my song. Then roses white and red, love, Through far eternal years, Shall flame about the head, love, Which Love immortal rearsâ And, joined in one when dead, love, We shall surmount life's fears. Therefore, my own, own, own love, Oh list to me to-night, Hear my harp's burning tone, love, Interpret it arightâ Black sorrow's wings have flown, love, In front the sky is bright. Come; through the mist of stars, love, Swift seek me; I am here. Burst all the lingering bars, love, With eyes as God's heaven clear Smite all that chills or mars loveâ Soft, summer-sweet, appear! MARIA FORSTER AND JEAN PAUL. âAs Maria Forster entered womanhood, Richter became the ideal of all that was dreamed or imagined. He was the only living mortal that was admitted into her ideal world; the purest and holiest of men, a saint, a ânew Christ for her,â who could alone bear her over the waves of life that threatened right and left to overwhelm her. To be near him in some form, or in some relation, was the only contingency in which she could find peace. To hold some kind of communion with him was a necessity of her nature. She must speak to him, or she must die.ââSee the âLife of Jean Paul Friedrich Richter.â Ah! could I see himâfor he fills my dreams With sweet white fancies flying in stray gleams, Like butterflies amid the meadow grass, Across my brain's mad vapour-shrouded glass. Ah! could I see him! all my heart is full At morning and at noon and when the cool Clear sunset gilds our cottage window-pane, And when night's glamour doth pervade my brain I am held by thoughts I know not how to speak; The red rose is a white rose in my cheek, And tears do throng my eyes, I know not how, And fever parches my torn sultry brow. Ah! Richterâfather, hear my fainting prayer, Borne towards thee on the sympathetic air; And let thy daughter's sorrow and her dreams Wake in thy soul responsive tender gleams. Thine own grand soulâwhose early power I felt Throughout my fiery girlhood burn and melt, Yetâguard me angels from immodest thought, But as a father's distant message brought Towards me on the gold angelic wings: Beneath thy fair touch all my spirit sings, Beneath the pressure of thy distant hands My spirit's smiling inner bloom expands. Ah! Richter, shall I see thee, my fair lord, In heaven, having cut Time's paltry cord Of separation, for thy loving sake, And plunged for thee beneath the death-cold lake? In heaven passion and reward are one, And moons are not detained from their sweet sun By distance, or by custom, or by fate. Ah! Richter, at the heavenly outer gate I tarryâfair grand genius-soulâfor thee, Having conquered Death's pale intermediate sea, As only women-souls can conquer Death By dainty witchery of rose-perfumed breath. That perfumeâah! my lover, shall be thine, And all my hands can weave of soft woodbine, And ivy, and white lilies, and gold corn, And poppies, that love's sleep may thence be born To flutter over us with healing wings, Even so thy passionate-voicÃ¨d daughter!âsings. Daughterâa simple daughterâah! good God, The cold interposition of Thy rod One moment was forgotten, and I soared Towards fragrant heights by maidenhood abhorred, And drank forbidden nectar in a dream. Nowâfather, thy departing garments gleam Like ghostly visitors across a wave, Or grasses beckoning around a grave. But fatherâmy sweet fatherâall thy tales Of high romance, at which the spirit pales With ecstasy and deep unuttered thought, Those legends which thy magic hand has wrought, Are made a part inalienable of me, As the moon's reflection mixes with the sea. I know not what I meanâI cannot say The things that trouble me from day to day, I only know that every flower I see Serves somehow to remind my soul of thee. I only know that every sunrise fair, Filled wildly with unutterable air, Wrenches my eager spirit till it turns Towards the house o'er which thy planet burns; And every sunset, red or green or grey, Hath but one same unerring word to say. I am but a mute maiden, I am young, And thou art first of those whose magic tongue Pervades the utmost limits of our land, A silver-voiced and silver-soulÃ¨d band. Who am I thus to venture to declare, Even towards the pure reliable high air, The passion that a daughterâis it so? Or are my spirits steeped in some dense glow Fetched from the entrancing mystic house of hell? O, haste ye angel-spirits, haste to tell A puzzled maid the way wherein to walk; I would be valiantâwould withstand and balk The power of Monarch Satan, if it be The Fiend who pierces and inhabits me. But it cannot be soâmy love is high, Even as an eagle in the utmost sky; And I am but a pale tree-perching bird, Far from the lowest limit of his word, And therefore may I safely send my voice Towards the region where the gods rejoice, Well-knowing that my high lord heareth notâ Yet would that he were with me in this spot, Or rather would that he were far away, Not covering me with blushes of dismay. Sweet, listen, let us traverse some lone wood Filled full with many herbs and flowers good, And I will weave a fragrant coronet To crown thy temples grey from labour's sweat, And weary from creation all alone. Thy wifeânay, is my idol overthrown? She cannot love him as I love my lord; She bears the marriage-sceptreâI a sword, Made sharp with distance and the pungent fire Of girlhood's young intemperate desire. Do I desire himâdo I long to sit At his dear feet, and watch the wild birds flit Over the tempting hollows of the sea, Knowing my love doth overshadow me? My longing is not of this world at all, I long to be released from earth's dull thrall, And, piercing the grey vapours of the night, To join my love beneath the golden light Of heaven, and God's grand pure ivory throne; There I may freely clasp him as my own, And with love's violence delicately intense, Still the delirious leaping of each sense. A MEETING: AFTER FIVE YEARS. After long years, long sighing and tears, By the sound of the sea we met: And the dear hand leapt to the heart that had slept, And the passionate eyes were wet. The sweet mouth thrilled, the pure eyes filled, And the swift hand sought the side: Oh, triumph for me, thus shaken to see My lady, my spirit-bride! Friends were near, and a husband and fearâ Not a word, not a whisper was said: But I laughed in my heart as she rose to depart, And her last long love-look sped. I laughedâfor I knew that my lady was true, That the years between were nought; Now the passionate face of my queen in her grace, Had again to my gaze been brought. Sad was the look, and the sweet lips shook, And the splendour of youth was gone: But clearly could I the spirit descryâ Pale, suffering, sweet, it shone. Clearly the spirit, mine own to inherit, Flamed forth from the face once more: And behind, as of old, the white waves rolled, And the sea-mist swept the shore. Again by the sea she smiled on me, And again I held her fast, And the uttermost bliss of a soft soul-kiss Was ours: it clung and it past. But utterly sweet in her swift retreat Was my ladyâshe must be so;â For sweetness is hers, and its gift she confers, And God's heart in her heart I know. TO GERTRUDE IN THE SPIRIT WORLD. WHAT ART THOU LIKE? What art thou like, sweet lady mine, I wonder? Kind friends have spokenâbut of no avail I find their earthly and much hindered tale Which this world's mortal weakness breaks in sunder. Oh, art thou rose-flushed, love,âor art thou pale? Oh, dwellest thou beyond all seas, all thunder, Or rose-built bowers of endless brilliance under, Soft haunts that no fierce storm-winged blasts assail? Lift up thy light of eyes upon me, sweet! Oh, are they hazel orbs, or are they brown? Or blue or greyâand flow thy tresses down In one rich auburn torrent to thy feet? Or are thine eyes of some unearthly hue, And locks diviner than e'en Raphael drew? THOU ART THE SUMMER. Oh, love! thou art the summer; thy sweet breast Is summer in its softest, tenderest glow:â Oh! what are lilies to thy neck of snow? The bosom wherein all my pain I rest, Soothed past all speaking, infinitely blest! Delivered now from every dart of woe And tribulation:âyea, sweet, kiss me soâ Now blush again, shaming the blushing west! Thou art the summer; mine eternal rose Thou art of heavenly summers yet unseenâ Bear thou thy love-soft sceptre, O my queen! Thy more than regal beauty now disclose; Sway all my pulses with imperial sway, A white moon moving my heart's tidal way. THE HAY-FIELDS ON THE CLIFF TOP. Just as the hay-fields on the cliff-top draw Seafarersâyea, two miles away from land! Bringing sweet thoughts of many a leafy strand, Making more hateful the fierce wind and raw That smites those barren furrows which they ploughâ Just as the scent of hay-fields makes the hand Tremble upon the oar, the heart crave now For fields where flowers and grass-blades do expand:â So, Gertrude, far away thou drawest me From life and labour, and their scentless seaâ Sweeter than hay-fields is thy spirit-breath, Which, loved one, lures me through the gulfs of death, More wonderful the magic of thine eyes, Convulsed at sight of which life swoons and dies. SWEET PASSIONATE SPIRIT. Spirit thou artâyet not beyond the reach Of passionâyea, more passionate because Not bound nor subject to dull earthly laws, Nor limited by earthly feeble speech. Sweet passionate spirit! in my song I teach The great grand truth that spirit-high desire To earthly longing is as potent fire To smouldering flameâthat death transfigures each. Oh, Gertrude, just because thou art a saint, A disembodied spirit, a queen indeed, With love of thy dear soul I yearn, I faint, My feet upon the flints, pursuing, bleedâ Sweet loving spirit! from heaven I bring thee down, To aid my labour, and bestow its crown! THY LAUGHTER. Oh, love, there is a laughter on thy tongue, Sweeter than music, tenderer than sighs, Softer than love's low questions and replies, Purer than when a nightingale hath sung! Lo! yesternight how soft the cadence rung! Oh, love, there is a laughter in thine eyes, Tho' thou art angel, when thy swift glance flies Towards me; thy lips laugh, honeysuckle-hung. Thy laughter hath a magic silver-sweet, A ripple of soft unearthly luring soundâ And oh how rings thy foot upon the ground, And oh how tender is thine own heart-beat When next to mine the tides in unison Rush first together, then, more softly, on. WHAT MATTERS IT? What matters it if I throughout the day Be plagued by common faces, dreary thingsâ At nightfall lo! the folding of thy wingsâ At eventide thy footstep on the wingsâ At eventide thy footstep on the way. The holy dusk thine holier advent brings, Gertrude, my spirit-queen whom I obeyâ Then of itself my harp awakes and sings, And forth the golden sweet dream-fancies stray. Oh, sacred lady, past all passion mine, Yea, past all earthly yearning, all desire, Hear thou the aspiration of my lyreâ Disdain not this rose-wreath that I would twine Softly for theeâoh twist it in thine hair, Making rich clustered blossoms yet more fair. A MAIDEN SPIRIT. In spite of all thy lives, maiden thou artâ For him who hath the soul to understand. Ringless thy finger is: unkissed thine hand: Spotless the untouched beauty of thine heart. Now we have met, sweet love, we shall not part. Make me the lord of immemorial land Wherein thou hast had thy treasures: flowers expand With thee that shine not now in vale or mart. They are the blossoms of a former world, By thy sweet power made manifest to me: Oh, the great wondrous calm white petals curled So softly and so smoothly that I see! Unfold them, lady,âand thyself unfold, That I may reach thy blossom-heart of gold! MAN'S DEVOTION AND WOMAN'S POTION: A STUDY OF PASSION. PERSONS REPRESENTED. Giuseppa. Giacomo, her Lover. In a small chamber.âGiacomo lying on a couch. Giuseppa sitting near him. Giacomo.â Is this the end of allâthe end of love? The end of rose-tined momentsâhonied hours In which the glad heart hardly knew itself, So swiftly sped its pulses on their way? Is this the end of all? Ah, love, Giuseppa, What part hast thou in any future world? Can those white shoulders gather golden wings? Can those white breastsâthe fairest breasts in Italyâ Bear the close pressure of angelic mailâ Breasts fit alone for scented garb of flowers? Can that strange fickle rosebud of a mouthâ Sweeter, to-day, to me than heretoforeâ Can that be changed into some lily pale, Meet for the sanctifying kiss of God? And can thy voice, that rings upon my ear With such a silver cadence that at farthest Ends of the earth I could not but respond, Can this be trained and trammelled for the lutes Of innocent high choruses in heaven? Nay, surely thou art mine for ever nowâ Mine, my Giuseppa, by thine own mad deed, Which, having put thee beyond pale of mercyâ Beyond the utmost pardon of pure heavenâ Makes me thy master and eternal lord. I have conquered thee at last, oh strong Giuseppa!â Most white Giuseppa!âtender, soft Giuseppa!â Playful Giuseppa!âinnocent Giuseppa!â Mere kitten-like, immaculate Giuseppa!â Rose-crowned, rose-flushed, and lily-sweet Giuseppa!â Pure, girl-like, flower-like, virginal Giuseppa!â Thee I have conquered utterly at last! Thou art in chains to me, oh, pale Giuseppa!â Nay, look not o'er thy shoulder, fierce and strangelyâ Thou art in chains to me, and not to him Who met thee in the gondola last nightâ In bonds to me, I say, and not to him! Now you are flushedâhave I been over cruel? Nay, sweet, I saw you both; I was the rose You took from out your bosom sweet and gave himâ Yea, I was in the rose; I watched you glide Under the moonlight past San Marco's steps, And, in the rose still, I beheld you kiss him! What! he was your own husband, do you say? Ah, true, true, trueâyou have been doubly falseâ First to your husband, then your lover-husband! How many, many times have you protested, With those red lips of yours set fast on mine, You loved meâloved me truly, loved me only! And now, fair woman-like, you do not find Your lover's love variety enoughâ You must return a little to your husband, Make assignations where they are not needed, Impart romance to the prosaic story Of common wedded love by pranks suspicious. I see!âyou tired of me, and so you turned Me to the husband, and your actual husband Into the image of a prowling lover. It was well done, my ladyâcleverly! The one thing that a woman cannot brook, The only thing, is any lack of passion; And to form passion there must be romance, Fair freshness, strangenessâcall it what you willâ The something subtle, flower-like, that provides A force to bar and mar satiety. A woman must have passion's roses freshâ Yea, just new gathered, with the sweet bright dew Of earliest morn upon the tender leaves; And so, e'en here in Italy, where a lover Can safeliest rest upon a woman's oath 'Tis thought, a woman amorous for adventure, Forsakes her lover, and, for fresh delight, Laughing, commits adultery with her husband! I seeâsee, see it all! Ah, Giuseppa! One small thing you forgotâone tiny thing: To leave your lover living when you spurned him. Then, then you might have easily forgotten; But now, since you have mixed that poisoned phialâ Nay, start not, lady; oh! I would not harm you; I would not harm those tender hands of yours, And that white, tender, perfect neck, for kingdoms! I knowâI love you all the better for it! I saw you when youâstealthy and divine, E'en then, in your most wicked marvellous beautyâ Crept to the room where I was lying sick And slowly poured the shining reddish dropsâ Seven was it? Ah, how tenderly you counted!â Into the glass by my bedside, believing That I was well asleep; I saw your eyes Flash when the last drop slowly tinkled down, And then I knew your heart was eased and glad. I see you nowâthe long neck slightly strained, The body forward bowed to reach the table; The glance quick, ready, eager, apprehensive, The hands not tremblingâevery nerve obedientâ One white rose struggling (where the dress, displaced By stretching forward, showed a flower-soft bosom) To slip beneath your bodice-work the while. Ah, sweet, you see I know the whole! I saw you! Why did I not cry out or speak? Why should I? What am I that you should not have your way And do your will, as ever you have done Since the first childish days when, glad together, We played in Venice hereâyea, sometimes played At rendering old fierce histories into fact, Old tales of Doges poisoned, or of lovers Stabbed suddenly i' the midst of burning kisses. We played at these thingsâmere past fairy tales; But now we play at truth. You poison me, And, on my word, it seems to me quite natural. Do it again. Come, put that tall glass nearer; Now take the medicineâlet us make believe. Fling out that orange-lily; pour the water Into the medicine; we will fancy it Is the same water that you used last night. Now give it me to drink. You are afraid? You fear the water? did not fear the poison? Ah, women do brave things, but they are cowards, Cowards at heart, the bravest and the fairest. This is the play, the other was rehearsal. But youâyou did it much the best last night: You killed your lover thenânow you restore him. Oh! bad, bad, bad! You'll never make an actress. What! you can cry! Oh, mere pale, feeble murderess! Attempt a murder, and then weep about it! But I am sorryâI would make you weep, And yet I would not, lest I spoil your beauty, For when I'm dead, oh sweet, fair queen of Venice, I want you to be queen of Venice still, And queen of your own husband; you, remember, Are doomed to his embraces now, poor child! You've broken all your lover-shield to pieces. But oh, those tears! I, dying here, Giuseppa, Declare with solemn and unshaken speech That they are sweet to meâso utter sweetâ So beyond every earthly figure sweet; That I, for this one pleasure at your hands, Would gladly perish through eternity. Yea, now I feel the hand of death more near, I grow more earnest. You shall listen to me. I say that now I see those tender tears In your great yearning eyes, and now I know By the sure intuition of the dying, And by the sense of love that pierces through All veils and all deceptions at the last, That you love meâme bestâand not another, I would not for ten thousand years upon The golden floors of God's most gracious heaven Have missed that draught of poison, which to me Is as the red delicious wine of love. Take, darling, darlingânow my speech grows harderâ Take, darling, when you die, when you would meet me, Just such another cunning, hidden phial, And bring it with you; I would have you hurt me, Still, still, yea never cease to wound and hurt me, For still, the more you wound the more I love you. I am content; I envy not your husband. You have not killed him; that superb, sweet honour Has been reserved for me, the humble lover. You never cared enough for him to kill him? Just so; a woman must feel passion when She takes such splendid trouble with a man, And puts her soul in peril for his sake. As for your soul, I'll get the penance ended Before you start for heaven; you shall be clear Of punishment, and ready to enjoyâ I bear the pain; and, when we get to heaven, You shall kill me again if so it please you, With better, more malignant heavenly poison. Oh! I am glad!âI cannot say how gladâ For now I've won youâwon you past denial; Your husband now has not a single claim. By this swift poison coursing through my veins I swear I win you; you are mine for everâ Mine are your lips, your cheeks, your whole sweet body, Sweeter than roses, which a man may die Because of, and thrice softly laugh to know it. And as for you, you need not fear; here is My dying deposition, signed, complete, Stating that I, in weariness of life, Took poisonâI the doer, I the culprit. And so I amâwhy should I give you trouble; I would have taken poison had I known You wished itâsaved you trouble, saved you danger. You should have told me; it was needless trouble To mix the potion with your own white hands, And with your own white hands to place it here. I ask your pardon that you had to do it. And now I feel the sword of death within meâ Come closeâcome closeâcome closer, oh Giuseppa. Andâah, I did not ask you so to kiss me, And so to wet my face and eyes and hair With tears. Ah, this is joy! Giuseppa.âI loved you always. THE WRESTLE FOR A SOUL. PERSONS REPRESENTED. Bianca: A coquettish girl. Enrico: A poet. Ursula: Enrico's friend. Scene 1.âMorning. Enrico and Ursula conversing. Enrico.â Bid me not stirâI have this woman's soul To struggle for, and win perchance, ere night. Ursula.â She is a selfish womanânot worth much. I hate all such, not having strength to love. Enr.â Not having strength? A powerless phrase to use! Must weakness then develop into hate? Ursula.â Not so, for God has strength to bring such back, And fold them safe within His loving arms. Enr.â What! God has strength, and woman is too weak! Oh, shame! that woman should be thus traduced, Thus slanderedâby a sister-woman too! Ursula.â God has the strength: but woman is not God, Nor yet a goddessâthough the poets talk Of goddesshood in many a sounding phrase. Enr.â And as for you, your part it is to make What poets say, true to the living fact. If woman will not follow, who can lead? Ursula.â Woman will follow: but Biancaâshe Is sinfulâshallowâselfishâcommonplace; A vicious, loveless woman of the world. Enr.â Oh, that is all a woman sees in this Frail, sad, mad womanâvicious, selfish, badâ Past hope, and irredeemable, no doubt. Ursula.â Yes, irredeemable by power of man. I hate suchâand I leave them unto God. Not without hope, I leave them unto Him. Enr.â It grieves me, lady, thus to hear you talkâ I thought your wings were whiter, and your hands Whiterâand all your heart a lordlier thing. Ursula.â And, perhaps, Bianca's hands and wings are white, You'll tell me that next! Perhaps her heart is largeâ Larger than mineâmore equal with your own. Enr.â Nay, white it is not; white it shall be soon, For I, by power of love will make it white. A woman cannot reach her! I will try. Ursula.â May God forbid that you should ever sell Your birthright for this mess of porridgeâwhen You talk so, those who love you can't but grieve. Enr.â That I am sorry for: but yet I feel The great sweet fire upon me, that shall reach Bianca even, and shall burn her pure. Ursula.â You are too proud, you ought to leave to God His crown of terrible atoning fire. It will destroy you, if you snatch it down. Enr.â Let it destroy me! It is better thus To perish, burnt in pieces by pure love, Than slow to tread the placid earthly ways. Ursula.â But yet the quiet earthly ways are sweet; Be gentle, patient, humble: and believe That God will bring all gracious things to pass. Enr.â You cannot understand: why I have moved In one great yearning dream through every spot Where fair Bianca's piteous sins were done. Yea, seen her with her lover, heard them kiss; I know the whole of it; I know her heart. Ursula.â Mere male mad follyâmere subjective dreams. That woman is too strong for you, I sayâ Too wickedly perverse at any rate. I understand a woman: you do not. But pray go on: of course I do not care. Enr.â I never thought you did care: don't protest. Ursula.â There are who care. I am not one of those. Enr.â I know it; wait, however, give me time. A little time I ask forâbut one night. At present leave me, and to-morrow go And see Biancaâthere may be a change. Ursula.â Good-bye. Scene 2.âAt Night. âEnrico alone in his chamber. A lamp burning dimly. A volume of poems open on the table, and a large red rose in a jar near it. [Enrico] He speaks. I have not reached her yetâthe task is harder, Her lover false has more force to retard her Sweet trembling lingering growth, than I had thought. [He pauses between the stanzas, and wrestles inwardly in spirit. But I shall reach her: though the end be other Than that of earthly triumph; if I smother My very life, the battle shall be fought. YeaâI will keep my promise made this morning, Though truth there may be in my fair friend's warning, A deep truth in the prophecy she brought. The fire of God upon me burns me throughly, And, as it burns, Bianca's soul leaps newly Into glad life, in flaming network caught. I feel the force go out from me, and reach her: Wind round her form, fast-trembling, and beseech her: I feel that some new marvel now is wrought. I feel the fiery spirit of God that trembles Along my soulâBianca's soul dissembles No more before it; she can cover nought. Yet as the strength is on me, I grow weaker: And sheâshe grows more tender fast and meeker, As if by some true lover's heart besought. I see her spiritâI see its former sorrowâ Yet as a girl laughs, she shall laugh to-morrow; Of black years she shall not remember aught. Oh, sacred spirit of womanâthis I give theeâ I win thy soulâif I may not outlive theeâ I bring thee silver streams for desert drought. Ha! the rose does it wither, The rose I brought hither This morning? Are its petals now paler, And drooping, and frailer, For a warning? The red rose is mine, And my spirit I twine In its leavesâ Its swift loss of bloom Means that somewhere in gloom, Death weaves A dark shroud for my tomb. [He pauses for a time, and appears to enter into a sort of trance state. While he is in this condition the colour rapidly and perceptibly ebbs from The petals of the red rose on the table. It grows paler and paler. A sweet strain of music, played not far off, enters the room. This appears to wake him. Ah! now I can speak; she is won: The fierce hot battle is done. She is crowned with the light of the sun On her brows: her life is begun. Bianca now she is not But Floraâa flower without spot. A blossom superb and cleanâ Tender in maidenly sheen. A spirit superb and pureâ Whose love and life shall endure. A sweet soul, spotless and fair, Garbed in a maidenhood rare. This I have won by my fight With the spirits of sorrow and nightâ To be followed, ever hereafter, By a girl's glad sinless laughter. Through my dream I heard Her maidenly new-born wordâ Her virginal fresh-wrought speech. It had power my heart to reach. And I shall never forget That her eyes were tender and wet When she woke this morningâthough The reason she may not know. And now I am well content That the veil of life be rent. For though I pass to the grave This wonderful soul I save. Though I, dead, pass to the night, This blossom henceforth is white. Though I am forgotten, I give To her leave to laugh and to live. [The rose now perfectly white, shakes, and falls from the jar to the ground. Now the eternal music poureth through me, Its great ecstatic yearning fills my brainâ It streameth round me like some wondrous rain. Ah, lady, didst not thou quite misconstrue me Yesterday? was I âproud,â âdefiant,â âwrong?â In one thing thou wast rightâI was not strong To bear that terrible fire of God for longâ It crowned me and saved Biancaâthen it slew me. Scene 3.âEarly Morning. âBianca singing as she dresses. I had a dream last night, And all my heart is light, Glad, as this dawn is bright. I dreamed that round me strong Arms passedâand I could not wrestle To pull and smite them away. Mad years of sorrow and wrong Fled, and I tried to nestle In the arms, and laughed as I lay. I laughed as I lay, soft-smiling To think I was found at lastâ Conquered, and soothed, and at peace; Freed from spirits defiling; Let loose from the sins that are passed, And granted a sweet release. So the strong arms wound right round me, And I could not struggle or stir, They were far too strong to evade. In blossomy bands they bound me, And I felt that to me they were Like a soothing shield and a shade. I felt the old fierce power Of the former passions die And vanish adown the wind: I was glad as a glad glad flower, And very content to lie With those arms about me twined. And now to-day I am changed, Though I hardly know the reasonâ Hardly can tell at all: Fresh hopes round me are ranged, And a fresh more summer-like season Seems to be within call. I feel like a girlâmy pillow Is damp with a rain of tears; (I had not cried for so long!) Spent is the stormy billow Of suffering: happier years Smile round me, a rose-crowned throng. [She looks in her glass suddenly. Why, my eyes were blueâ They are changedâchangedâchanged to grey, To a greyer tinge than before. And a look of one I knew Is in themâEnrico whose lay Of love once lisped at my door. Softer I feel to the singerâ I know notâsofter I feel: More tender and grave than of old. [She hears passers-by speaking below the window. They sayâ Enrico is deadâhis finger O'er the harp no more will steal: The poet is crowned and is cold. TO HELEN. THE FRAGRANT NIGHT. Some âperfumed nightâ of summer shall be ours If not on earth, then in the spirit-land; Lo! I shall take thee, smiling, by the hand, And draw thee towards love's soft eternal bowers. Before us great white heavenly buds expand, Not dashed and splashed by earthly thunder-showersâ A meeting waits us which no parting soursâ A haven, far beyond life's desert-sand. Oh, grand the calm pure heavenly blossoms there, And glad their fragrance, and divine the air, And tender the mute yearning in our eyes: O queen of all my deep and passionate heart, In that soft bower we meet no more to part, Joined utterly beneath the starry skies. HAVING OUTLIVED, OUTSUFFERED. Having outlived, outsuffered, all the rest, We two shall mark the small loves fade away, Hidden in the sunlight of our perfect day; Yea, we shall mount upon the last wave-crest Of life into some region wholly blest, And meet with gaze unflinching Love's full ray; Oh, tarry for me, loveâbelieve, obeyâ Joy waits us such as dreamer hath not guessed! Tarry for me beside life's weary sea, Beside the breakers, by the craving foamâ This earth is not our rest, it is no home. Lo! in the end, sweet, I will come to thee, And thou no more from my true arms shalt roam: Then dawns the eternal spirit-ecstasy. OH, SEA! âOh, seaâ that flowed anear our passionate love Once, when that passionate love did blossom sweetlyâ Yea, when the passion-rosebud bloomed completelyâ âSea,â whose dear waves our very hearts did move, We bid thee, when our passion blooms above, Welcome to our triumphant bridal feastâ Sea, thou shalt be our white-robed splendid priest, Our spirit of blessing,âthee we are certain of! Oh faithful and attendant groomsman, Seaâ Groomsman and priest and bridesmaid all in one, Be thou a guest at our glad marriageâSun, The wedding feast doth also wait for thee; And, moon and stars, no meet robe can be spun Without your helpârespond ye speedily! STIR NOT. Stir notânay lie thou still within my arms; Set thou thy lips on mineânow never more Let the great rising sun-flame gild the shore. Dear, let us dieâcold life it is that harms And hinders loveâoh, would that life were o'er! Lie still now, sweet oneâlet the long night last For ever! let us dream that life is past, Stoop lips, and kiss death's breakers as they roar! Oh, let us dream it is eternal night, Yea, ânever the cold daylight any more!â Never the sad reproachful mocking lightâ Cling now to mine, sweet lips, cling as before; Let love enrobe us with his golden might, And tender darkness round our bodies pour. AFTER THE DAY. Pain through the long day lords it o'er our souls, But when the sweet night comes, my voice brings back The passion that all day about thy track So gently hoveredâin the love-wave rolls. Through all our daily toil the thought of love Is underneath, around us and aboveâ But in the night it is a present flower, Great, burning, awfulâglowing with new power Oh wander, if thou pleasest, in the day Far as thou canstâunfettered, flit away Like some bright butterfly above the foam! At night, when thou dost mark the land afar, And heaven one sheet of blackness with no star, My love shall be thy ship of rest, thy home! CALM. I'll give thee calm, sweet, not swift passion only. Oh, we have sailed through passion-storms together, And faced intrepid, the black boisterous weather, And, sometimes, one has left the other lonely, Sad, silent, for a seasonâbut these things Shall passâI'll lift thee towards a clearer air, I'll bring thee summer on love's fervid wings, The tree of love its red-ripe fruit shall bear. All storms of wayward perilous passion o'er, Thou shalt inhale the tender summer breeze Of love, and rest, secure, upon the shore We seek, wherover bend heaven's restful treesâ Love shall excel, in quiet, evermore, The calm of midnight on Pacific seas. ALONE TOGETHER. Though friends surround us, or a noisy crowd, Unsympathising faces, alien minds, Enemies perhaps, or voices harsh and loud, Souls wherein no response our spirit finds, Yet in a moment we can draw the shroud Of golden love about us and, alone, Mount to our tranquil solitary throneâ Pass in a moment into passion's cloud. There are we sweetly hidden and encasedâ As if we stood beside some southern sea Alone, while at our feet blue wavelets chased Each other, laughing in their untamed gleeâ Thine eyes on mine, my arm about thy waist, With one bird singing from the nearest tree. STILL THERE. The holy day will come when thou no more Shalt wander from meâwhen our sweet love-sun Shines upon labour finished, duty doneâ When, joined at last, our souls shall upward soar. Upon eternal lite's untrodden shore We two shall standânot two indeed, but one Pure white-winged spiritâlovely, seen of none Save God and love; crowned conquerors after war. Thou shalt not leave me thenâthine eyes shall meet Mine fully, freely, gladlyâthou shalt be My wife-rose in the utmost heavens, sweet, The sacred and completing half of me; As I glance up then, thou shalt not retreat, Still there, and thereâand there eternally. THE GENIUS OF SOLOMON. King Solomon at night discourses to a dark-eyed captive maiden concerning his dreams of new culture and strange gods. Surely the roses in this woman's hair Bring thoughts of gods as holy and more fair Than the austere Jehovah of our race, Who shone on Sinai with terrific faceâ Surely the strange white goddess of the moon Worshipped by night with many a wandering tune, Whose tresses gleam adown the wanton hills, And whose soft altars shine beside the rills, Hath somewhat in her that our cold high God Lacksâhe can smite with red impetuous rod, But this soft goddess of the smooth fair night Brings only endless, amorous delight:â O gentle daughter of a foreign tribe, What think'st thouâsurely, but for curse and gibe Of priests and sour-faced prophets, long ago I had raised many an altar, white as snow, To the delicious gods whose black locks gleam By many a pure and pale Assyrian stream. Our high God loathes the names of Ashtaroth And Molochâat their rites his soul is wroth; Yea, at the sight of their smooth heathen breasts He lifts the thunderous lance that near him rests; Yet do I fancyâsoft girl is it so? That thy soft goddess' bosom is of snow, And all her golden locks are passing fair, And subtle fragrances her shoulders bear, And marvellous delights unknown to Jews Thy nation winsâwhy, why should we refuse To mingle delicate reverence for strange gods With our own joys, for fear of those fierce rods Wherewith Jehovah's anger scourges those Who love not only lilies, but the rose As well?âmy maiden of the long black hair, Brought to me from some distant city fair By the rough hands of strenuous men of war, Some city underneath an occult star, Now lift thy laughing lips and tell to me What strange gods rule beside that foreign sea. What temples golden, glorious as the sun, Smile towards the skies no Hebrew glance has won. What sister-women fairer than our race, Pass laughing towards these temples with bright face When evening calls the people unto prayer; O, more than David I love liberal air, And I would stretch my soul beyond these bounds, Seeking far skies no mountain-tower surroundsâ Loving the lovely gods of all the earth, Joining the innocent unshackled mirth Of many a white-limbed cluster of fair girls, Twining an amorous hand through alien curls. O lady of love, brought to King Solomon, On whom a ray of his great glory has shone, What think'st thou? Kiss me, teach me with thine hands To lift up prayers towards gods of many lands. Yeaâturn my face this night as thine hath turned Full many a time towards deities scorned and spurned By the rude votaries of the lonely One Who rules severely above the gold glad sun, Above the lingering circlet of the moon, Above the clamorous rivers' far-spread tune, Above the billows and breezes of the sea, Above thy beautyâyes, sweet, above meâ Above the lordly king of this rich town, At whose straight knees the wandering tribes bend down; And who has in his royal seraglio Flowers plucked where'er the foot of love can go. Help me; forget thy sorrow for this night, Turn towards the King those orbs of gentlest light, Help me to teach the people in spite of priest And prophet, that a splendour in the least Slight plant or insect shows that One alone Frowns not from one vast immemorial throne, Not mixed with Natureâstanding high aloof Beyond our daring thoughts, our wisest proofâ Beyond our wordsâbeyond adoring looks, Silent as endless deserts empty of brooks; Naked as if the ornate world were nought, Clothed only in his own pale boundless Thought, Apart from usâapart from all these flowers; Lifted above the bloom of rose-hung bowers; Lifted above the glare of sacred torches, And voices tender of maidens in the porches; Raised terribly above these earthly things, Supported by insufferable wings Of brilliance no man can gaze uponâ Rather that every blossom of the field Some living breath of deity doth yield, And that strong gods pervade the flowing air, And shine beneath the dark-green billows fair; And that the lordly forests, dim and tall, Are but the wood-nymphs' interwoven hall, And that the mountain-sides are trodden indeed By sacred steps of gods who intercede For even the most remote uncultured raceâ Nayâblush not, sweet one, look me in the face, For, though I am a king, I long to be One with the fervent Nature that I see. Lo! one red rose has fallen from out thy hair, What goddess, love, I wonder white and fair Resides within the bush whence this was plucked? Whose fragrant mouth full many a bee hath sucked As the soft lips have glimmered from each flower. Would that I might in her sequestered bower Bring gifts of holy meaning, love, with thee, And that her quiet face might smile on me, For I am weary:âWeary of the days Not given to song, not crowned with flowers and bays, Not wreathed with wisdom's blossoms nor with lore Unsearchedâbut dull and bloomless as before. Once in the night the Spirit of the Lord Came unto me, and pierced me as with sword Tender, and asked me to desire a gift Of Godâthen tremulous voice I did uplift, Craving that wisdom from on high might shine Upon the anointed prince of Abraham's line. And God has given me wisdomâI am wise Beyond these Hebrews, who, with downcast eyes And querulous and introspective gaze, Pass through Jerusalem on holy days, Seeking the steaming altars of their God:â Weary I am of his superb abode; Weary of smoking spices and of myrrh, And fine-wrought ceilings woven of foreign fir, And delicate hangings coloured blue and red, With golden intermingled rivulets shed Between, and sheen of ivory, and brass Immeasurable, and white foam of glass, And pointed windows and rich-carven panes, Blended in crimson evanescent stains; And endless wealth of radiant sapphire stones, Ruby and onyx, emeraldâand the tones Of subtle music wandering through the roof And round the walls of velvet warp and woof. I long for gods who plunge in running rivers; I long for women-godsâmy strained heart shivers With wearinessâI feel a lone fatigue, I long to flee this city many a league, And in some quiet warm flower-haunted wood Find a new goddess, tender and wise and good. The very thought contamination bringsâ That Judah's prince should muse upon these things, Is sure pollutionâyet I deem that worth Is found in every corner of God's earth. In thee I can discover many a grace Wanting to our fierce narrow-minded race; And why should the great Ruler of the wind And sea be fashioned after one male mind, And womanhood excluded from his heart And bosom?âthe dark clouds asunder part, And in prophetic vision I can see Throned far above Jehovah a form like thee. I am before my people! they will keep For ever their monotheistic sleep, And dream for ever Sinaitic dreamsâ It is their fateâtheir missionâbut fair gleams Of wider faiths have shone upon the kingâ They understand me notâand so I bring My stores of hope and yearning to the feet Of this poor captive damsel, mute and sweet. Dost understand me, maiden, when I say That I can pierce beyond this present day Of bigoted slow worship, to a time When faith shall be more fervid, more sublime? These women in my harem all bring tales Half-muttered coyly underneath their veils, Of worships tenderer than the worship here; And though our smug-faced prophets frown or sneer, I see that every tender thing is true, Whether it be an ancient tale or new. Speak to thy sisters, bright one, tell them I Would gather wisdom from beneath each sky, Even as I gather roses from each land, For kingly love to grasp with passionate hand; Sparing no timid blossom of any race If she be fair, with pure blood in her face. Nothing can stay the flame-flushed plumes of thought, Before their fire tradition is of nought AvailâI cannotâthough I would, conceal The limitless strange yearnings that I feel. The brides that I have brought from many lands, Have taught me secrets no man understands Of all these men whose brains are fat with lore Unshapely, gathered in the days of yore. O dark eyed maiden with the long dark hair, Open the casementâlet the fragrant air Of night delight our brows. See, every star Flames like a god or goddess from afar! I wonder wherein doth Jehovah sit? By which star are his golden candles lit? Which sun doth God choose for his lonely throne? By what night-breezes is his forehead shown, As their embraces part the rigid hair?â Rather I would be touched by fingers fair Of star-like goddesses whose golden beauty Forms of itself the only law of duty, Seeing that all fair things are as good as fair. Draw back now, maiden, from the darkling air, And when thou thinkest of King Solomon, Remember how this night his love hath shown To thee the voiceless dream that round him clings With hurtle of incessant airy wings, Driving and goading all his spirit on Beyond the paths where David's banner shone; Beyond the safe soft roads of common life, Towards limitless deserts of uncertain strife; Beyond the narrow barriers of his race, Towards some new God of boundless fearless face. Alas! thy roses all have fallenâeven so These thoughts they gave me flutter and fall, and go. SONNET. ONE ROSE. A vision in the beauty of the night! I saw a woman perfectly displayed, Grand in her awful nakednessâafraid I wept for terror at the lovely sight, I wept for pleasure at the lovely might Of snowy limbs before me in the shade; My love, with every snowy limb portrayed, Leaned on the dusk, angelically bright. Naked she stood; her awful beauty thrilled Each fibre of my bent, uncovered soul, The room with that strange loveliness was filled, And over my sick sense a faintness stole; Her beauty was, this time, intensely bare, Save for one fiery, full rose in her hair. THE KITTEN. It does not matter much, love, You did not mean to slay, You did not think a touch, love, Would throb throughout the day; You did not mean it much, love, I know you were in play. A kitten's claws can scratch, loveâ You think it is not so?â I think they can despatch, love, Although you answer âNoââ I feel that they can scratch, love, And make the red blood flow. It does not matter, sweet love, That half triumphant tear, 'Tis something of a feat, love, For me to have brought near;â Although to see it, sweet love, Has cost me very dear. FOUR SONNETS. I.âTHE ROSE OF GOD'S BLOOD. âEven now we know, that when we shall see Christ as He is, we shall be like Him that His heart is infinitely more tender than oursâthat we have never loved as Jesus has loved, and yet it is He who will pronounce the awful sentence, âDepart, ye cursed, into everlasting fire.ââThe italics, in this miserable ascription of priestly smallness and cruelty to Christ, are my own.âG. B. âHigh Truth,â by the Rev. R. Aitken, p. 139. At times I feel like Cromwell, or like those Who laughed to mark the bitter guillotine Make many a sudden breach abrupt and clean In the fair slender necks of Freedom's foes. I feel that till the Supreme Tyrant goes Life's air will not be perfect and sereneâ God's throat must first incarnadine the green Planet, like some imperial flattened rose. Just as a great rose trodden in the mire Must God's fair beauty and his splendour be; Already is it fashioned in the fire, The sword that, like some towering wave at sea, Shall fall upon him, setting the desire Of all the renovated nations free. II.âTHE CROWN OF FLOWERS. Suggested by a picture, at the French Gallery, of Christ's head after death. âNever a true crown, but Thy crown of thorn.â âMacdonald. It is a cursed lie! that pallid head Is not the wearer of the only crown That the white hands of kingly God lay down; All garlands are not streaked with bitter red. Bring flowers for other limbs than those which bled On Calvary near the narrow-minded townâ Bring roses meet for snowy not for brown And toil-worn breastsâthis man is amply dead! As for the speech that heads this sonnet, I Declare that 'tis a cursed barren lie! The only true crown is the crown of flowers! As for the faith that there is only one Triumphant victor underneath the sun, That may be England's faithâit is not ours. III.âIN ENGLAND'S NAME. In England's name, in God's name, in the name Of wide Humanityâand by the heart Of womanhood transfixed by Christ's keen dart; By mine own indignation like a flame That leaps and scorches heavenâand by the shame Branded on English love and English art And English flowers and seas, when souls impart To Christ dear secrets that our land should claimâ By all these bitter things, Lord Christ, I swear That, as thy cross became a golden crown And all thy blood-drops roses in thine hair, So now thy garlands time shall scatter down: England thou hast usurped! on rough oak block Of England lay thy King's neckâwait the shock! IV.âFACE TO FACE. Since thus the spirit of love for mine own land Pervades me, and I let it have its will, I recognise the brave Christ-saviour still, And touch with reverence his ringless hand. Lonely, and face to face with him I stand, Watching the cross upon the rocky hillâ The heart his priestly followers strive to fill With their own thought, beyond them doth expand! High as the azure dome above them glows The utter soul of Christ which now I see For the first time, because one English rose With sweet red bloom uplifts me more than heâ I reach him, leaving himâthe God-King dies, And lo! the Peasant, with great genius-eyes! THE RELIGION OF ART: EIGHTEEN SONNETS. I.âVENUS. Back, back to Venus, perfect as a rose, My soul went: worshipped in her inmost bower The world's one comfortâyea, the world's one flower, Whence ever love's ethereal perfume flows. Ah! how the white breast, kissed and fondled, glowsâ How deep delight fast waxes hour by hourâ How the soft outspread limbs of Venus shower Rapture, and peace no saint of heaven knows. Here I abide; the scent is on my hands And on my tongue, and all my soul partakes The souls of blossoms plucked in strange dim landsâ Now over me some spell Queen Venus shakes, And I am mute awaiting her commands, Watching her eyes of laughter as she wakes. II.âTHE IMMEASURABLE ROSE. The hair of Venus woven with soft sprays Allured me, wondering as it downward slid Slowly and half her fragrant body hid, So that the tender white shone through an haze. Here was a red rose twined in subtle waysâ There a white rose of flesh that gleamed unbidâ No rose as those impassioned roses did, Enamouredâfondly they besought the gaze. Ever before me shines this vision high: The endless hope it leads to no man knows, Its splendour has not perished, though I dieâ Still in the deep heart of each poet glows Venusâand still her tresses wander by, Circled with the immeasurable rose. III.âUPON THE BREEZES. Upon the breezes tenderly displayed The hair shines; in all blossoms I behold The soft locks woven, threads of living goldâ Across the sunset floats a loosened braid. Death fails now more to make the world afraid, For the utter tale of love has now been toldâ In passion and through passion we are bold, Nor can a further word of hope be said. Because sweet Venus in the living air Shines, and upon the gilded sunset seas, Therefore the human life, love-crowned, is fairâ Impassioned thereby the warm noontide breeze, And softened thereby all the calm we share When silver lamps of night illume the leas. IV.âCONTEMPLATION. Calm contemplation is the end of Artâ Not to perturb her bosom at the sighs Of each poor sufferer as the sufferer dies, But to preserve a white unblemished heart. The generations weary and depart, But she, with equal and majestic eyes, Her being to the omnipotent allies, And wearieth not, as forth the young buds start. At utter peace she sits; and all the years Bring to her joys and sorrows for a crownâ Thorn-wreaths and roses, lilies and hot tearsâ She marks them all; she watches with no frown, Not smiling either, man's rage, woman's fears, Blood, torture, terror, flames of many a town. V.âTHE ARTIST. So Art sitsâand the artist is at peace; He hopes not, dreads not, toils not, nor despairs, Healing for him upon the summer airs And strength descend, as rose-crowned years increase. Death is not terrible, but calm releaseâ Life is not over-glad: its gifts life bears And then the grave, its final gift, preparesâ The hour when even rose-delight shall cease! Gathering from Art her high triumphal calm, The artist, each day's wreath within his hands, Strengthened at morning, soothed by evening's balm, Victor above the impulsive people stands:â Not his the heavenly coronet nor palm, But his earth's sunsets, his her seas and sands. VI.âLOVE. And love because it looks not for too much As heretofore, is sweeter than of oldâ The poet, singing with his mouth of gold, Shall not find love evade his golden touch. The imperious red rose is most surely such, Because it fades and withers when we hold The stem, by strong desire made over-bold; And so love hitherto escapes man's clutch. But when we see that just because love fades And withers, is sweet love to be desired, Love no more vanishesâno more evadesâ The red love-rose magnificently fired With heaven's best tints, casts brilliance down the glades; Death is the life towards which its bloom aspired. VII.âDEATH. O death most wonderful, O death most good, O death most holyâbringing rapt release, Bringing the senses universal peace, Placing us in a godlike solitude! When once the lonely awestruck soul hath stood Upon thy mountain-tops, what vast increase Of passion shall enthral and thrillânor cease To work out raptures meet for every mood! O perfect spirit of death stay not thy hand, But make us one with all the women fair Who flower-like sought to scent the flowerless land, And with their breath make all the icy air Quiver with lovely summer, and thy sand Now eddy stream-like as with rippling hair. VIII.âTHE DEATH OF THE FIRST FAIR WOMAN. For when the first fair trembling woman died Death was abolishedâall his heart did melt E'en at that utter beauty which he felt Gathered like some strange blossom at his side. He could not bear the beauty of his brideâ He could not bear the stroke her beauty dealt Soft and white-handed; as he grasped her belt, Kissing, life-loosening, death was deified. He could not bear the ecstasy of this The first embrace of her the first red rose; Fainting, death vanished in a stream of bliss, Made one with life and love in thrills and throes Deliciousâat the beauty of her kiss Death shudders; all his threatening purpose goes. IX.âTHE EMBRACE. Oh marvellous embrace of death and life, What will the final wondrous issue be? Red rose what is thine own futurity, Now thou art unto death a flower-lipped wife? What shall be, now, the ending of this strife? Now thou hast kissed the mouth of death shall he Forsake his old malign ascendancyâ Will all his valleys now with buds be rife? Oh woman, woman, surely this strange tale Has utter meaningâLove upon life's air Pours immortality, and thou art pale With over-love, a lily in thine hair, A rose upon thy breast: cast off thy veil, Kill death with body over-sweet to bear. X.âTHE RAPTURE BEYOND. And all the rapture beckoning beyond! The tender grasses soft beside the way, And all the fervour of the first long day In heaven, and all love's kisses pure and fond! Death is the enchanter who with magic wand Shall turn earth's skies Novembral, cold and grey, Into sweet sunsets sweet as the display Of August, when the red cloud-mail is donned. All flowers in heaven are womenâall are white Therefore; they dazzle gleaming from the sod, Soft from the valley, silver from the height, Moon-tinted round each grass-bedecked abode, Fragrant and fresh as from the burning bright Profound unutterable embrace of God. XI.âWITHIN THE NIGHT. Surely, within the sacred folding night All lovers meet beneath the smiling stars, All chains are loosened, broken are all barsâ Love is the conquerorâhis the iron might. Mute with a rapture passing speech in height The lovers wander forth in golden cars Of love now, no more, glaring day-flame marsâ No more the inquisitive intrusive light. Beside dim forests or beside the sea All lovers meet, in dream-land, and their lips Cling close together soft and tenderly; The hot sun's glory is love's moon-eclipseâ The tides of night doth Venus traverse; she The wide intoxicating moonbeams sips. XII.âNO DESPAIR. Therefore let no one lover e'er despairl For though his lady distant be by day, At night she wanders with him in the way, And lights his path with floods of golden hair: Makes all the road a blossoming garden rare By wandering scents that from her bosom stray, Or round her forehead like a spring-breeze playâ Touching to holier life the enamoured air. Let but the lover waitâthen suddenly Before him, glorious with pure body white, His one fair moon of women he shall see Rising to rule the empire of the night; Her sudden eyes, now deep, now swift with glee, Shall flame across his path, and lead aright. XIII.âTHE FIRST ROSE. The first sweet rose-bud was a woman's hand:â God saw the hand, he saw that it was fair, And, eager, longed the prize away to bear To his own Paradise, his chosen land. For miles of Paradise in hopeless sand Were sunk, and perfumed not the dry faint airâ So, with his keen sword severed he the rare And white delight; far-gleaming, subtle, grand. The red drops quivered slowly from the wristâ But ever as a rosebud the sweet toy Blossomed in heaven, and ever God's mouth kissed The token, laughing with a jealous joy: âFor,â said he, ânow let man do what he listâ Having her hand, her heart I can destroy.â XIV.âTHE FIRST RED ROSE. But the pale bleeding wrist took life anew For man's sweet sake, and blossomed on the earth, And at this blossom's splendid trembling birth Heaven helped by soft showers of strength-quickening dew. Soon the red wrist a red rose 'neath the blue Of heaven flamedâand man with quiet mirth Appraised the flower and knew what it was worth, Left God the white rose, and content, withdrew. This splendid blossom tinged with woman's blood Man holdeth ever; nor can God dispose Its petals in his heavenly solitude:â Fair woman best her heart of passion knows, And though one slay her in a jealous mood, Each drop of blood turns to her lover's rose. XV.âFROM LOVE. From Love the high celestial story sprang! Sweet Love the gates of heaven deep-set in gold Alone hath power and magic to unfoldâ At Love's voice all the heavenly valleys rang! Love's foot it was that smote with martial clang The floors of hell, and, spirit ever bold, The captives from that pitiable hold Releasedâat Love's step all the dumb mouths sang. The thought of harps and heaven is only love Made visible and audible on high:â God reigneth truly, yea, he reigns above, But all his empire in a woman's eye Is holdenâand the Spirit we call God's Dove In woman's dove-like bosom fluttereth nigh. XVI.âNO GREATER JOY. There is no greater joy than simple joys:â The man who once has kissed a living rose The utmost circle of God's bounty knows,â All heavenly raptures are our fancy's toys. With plumes spread in divinest equipoise Love forth throughout the swaying planet goesâ His bosom is God's bosom, and it glows Ardent against the wind that upward buoys. Truly, we dream of heavenly roses red, And lilies fairer than our lilies white, And crowns more pure than bay-leaves for the head:â But when we win that glory's utmost sight, And laugh to wear our victory, being dead, Mere grass shall be than God's best throne more bright. XVII.âAN ANGEL. Slowly and white the first sweet angel came Towards me in heaven, and held within her hands A garland woven of white violet-bands, With one rose in the centre like a flame. It seemed a fit return of love and fameâ Meet recompence for wanderings o'er the sands Of lonely earth, and toil in desert landsâ Ready I was the blossom-wreath to claim. But, when I touched it, all the wondrous smell Of those white violets brought the earth again Before me, and it was as if there fell Upon the ground soft showers of spring-like rainâ And the angel was the rose too sweet to tell I' the centre: just a woman, white thro' pain. XVIII.âTHE TEMPEST. The tempest of the sovereignty of God Down-smote me,âlike a flower I fell before His thunder's perilous terrific roar, Crushed flat on the convulsed and trembling sod. The lightning flashed forth like his flaming rod, And the utmost tingling heaven strange portents boreâ And life seemed just a bubble, nothing moreâ And the universe like one red furnace glowed. But soon the storm was over, and I heard Loud in the tree-tops glistening from the rain, The voice of Love sonorous as a bird Who knows the speckled partner marks his strain: And all God's sovereignty seemed now conferred On Man and Womanâthe lone god-like twain. THE MELODY OF LIFE. SIX SONNETS. I.âLIFE. Life onward flowsâand now as I look back, I see, perhaps, the sweetest loves behind: The fairest wreaths of blossoms perhaps were twined When youthful feet were eager on the track. Oh, for one breath of the dear balmy wind That played across the meadows where I trod When gold-harped king Apollo was my god,â When first for the august green bays I pined! Oh, for one breath now of the former air That kissed my brows, delicious from the sea, Soft from the meadows, from the mountains fair, Fragrant from the divine flower-sprinkled lea,â Oh, for one perfect kiss from lips that were Tender, in the old tender days, for me! II.âHAS IT ALL PASSED? Has it all passed? Is there no more divine Nectar of love made ready in the years To come,âno further draughts of passion's wine? No further circlets,âthough these drop with tears? Better it is a dewy wreath to twine Than no wreath,âbetter is a cloud-swept day Than utter darkness crushing with dismay The sun-desiring rose, the sweet woodbine. The wreaths of passion were full often wet With tears, I know it,âyet how sad the dry Long passionless cold days that must be met,â The path that must be traversed by-and-bye,â The glancing back,âthe wondering,âthe regret,â The seeking for lost pleasure;âtill we die. III.âTHE LONE DAYS. And oh, the lone interminable days Unkissed, uncrowned, ungarlanded with song, Unglorified with flowers, unwreathed with bays,â Hours when the phantom memory is strong, And thoughts of past delights in myriads throng The vestibules of mind, and scoff, and raise Banners that once were golden as with blaze Of love,âsound trumpets whose love-notes were long. Oh, bitter, bitter, bitter,âwhen we see The glad young roses by the window pane, Soft-budding, reddening, with the purity Of perfect bloom their yearly clusters gain:â Knowing that bloom is passed, for you, for me,â That nought save autumn seasons now remain. IV.âPAST KISSES. The thought of former kisses still is sweet. Tender at night the trembling stars gaze down, And we remember how those stars did crown Wonderful nights of loveâhow hearts did beat, And how we yearned towards eyes of blue or brown And how the thrilling tingling palms did meetâ Oh, the divine nights after August heat! The strolls through green lanes far from street or town! Wonderful early days, and loves of those Soft early days, and gladness of the same, And beauty that then rested on the rose, A gentle spiritual caressing flameâ Ah! never comes a love-day but it goes! The rose-fire endeth in autumnal shame! V.âTHE JOY OF LOOKING BACK. And yet there is a joy in looking back, A holy rapture in the very loss Of love that almost like a sacred cross We carry, all along the blood-dyed track. Our feet were swift once, if our steps are slack Now,âand fresh feet will follow in the way, Walking like us towards night-time through glad dayâ Never will Love his crowd of followers lack! Sweeter embraces than the embraces sweet That gladdened our past youth shall gladden these: Diviner summer,âyea, more rapturous heat Of June, and tenderer murmurs in the trees, And yet more soft a cadence in the feet Of woman,ânobler music in the seas. VI.âIT MAY BE. It may be that the lovers of the days To come, shall far excel our feeble speech, Our feeble thought,âthat they with ease shall reach Summits we dream not of, or see to praise Not to possess:âit may be that the lays Of future years shall be to ours divine Indeed: that lovers' happy eyes shall shine Godlike: that love shall traverse novel ways. But yet we know that all our love was true, And that for us once shone fair passion's day; That once love's awful holy dream was new, And that at least one tender red-rose spray Fell to our lot; that once high heaven was blue For us, and once at least life's music gay. A SOUL-WREATH. Shall the wreath be woven of roses, or gold, or of bounteous bays, Or lilies white as thy heart, or violets pure as thy dreams, Or pansies purple as those far fathomless oceanstreams By which we wandered both, in love's fair earliest days? Shall the wreath be redder than blood, or whiter than new-fallen snow, Or green as the grass in April, or rich as the August corn, Or grey as the autumn skies through which the wild winds blow, When love's first vision is over, and passion sobs forlorn? Not like any of these, but rather a wreath of the soul: A wreath from the utter heavens, a garland plucked on the hills, Shall be thine, sweet-smelling of mountains, and soft from the flowing of rills In wonderful lofty places where mystic cloud-wreaths roll. Surely our souls are one: and the garland of death most sweet Shall some sweet day be ours: we shall lay hands on his neck And hamper his swift-foot flight, and put new chains on his feet, And his speed for us shall be lessened, and he shall bend at our beck. Then we shall stand sublime, a new fair crown on our heads, Fairer than crowns of rosesâthe crown of a high work done That shall shine with perfect glory, more bright and pure than the sun: This the divine reward is, for every spirit that bleeds In the van, on the crest of the battle, beholding glad from afar The glory that comes so slowly, yet swift and sure as the wind Is its course in the endâit shall blend like a sacred and spotless star With the night of our lives now brightened,âthe agony left behind. Therefore I crown thee not: since Death us two shall crown; And bring us the best of garlands, and place us, beyond all graves, In some soft fragrant forest, or by the sound of the waves:â On the rose of our Love not a leaf shall tremble, no bud wax brown. THE END.</field>
