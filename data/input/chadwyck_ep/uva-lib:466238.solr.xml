      <field name="fulltext">Vol. I I OXFORD AND ST. ANDREWS Almæ Matres (St. Andrews, 1862. Oxford, 1865) St. Andrews by the northern sea, A haunted town it is to me! A little city, worn and gray, The gray North Ocean girds it round; And o'er the rocks, and up the bay, The long sea-rollers surge and sound; And still the thin and biting spray Drives down the melancholy street, And still endure, and still decay, Towers that the salt winds vainly beat. Ghost-like and shadowy they stand Dim mirrored in the wet sea-sand. O ruined chapel! long ago We loitered idly where the tall Fresh budded mountain ashes blow Within thy desecrated wall: The tough roots rent the tomb below, The April birds sang clamorous, We did not dream, we could not know, How hardly fate would deal with us! O broken minster, looking forth Beyond the bay, above the town! O winter of the kindly north, O college of the scarlet gown, And shining sands beside the sea, And stretch of links beyond the sand, Once more I watch you, and to me It is as if I touched his hand! And therefore art thou yet more dear, O little city, gray and sere, Though shrunken from thine ancient pride And lonely by thy lonely sea, Than these fair halls on Isis' side, Where Youth an hour came back to me! A land of waters green and clear, Of willows and of poplars tall, And, in the spring-time of the year, The white may breaking over all, And Pleasure quick to come at call. And summer rides by marsh and wold, And autumn with her crimson pall About the towers of Magdalen rolled; And strange enchantments from the past, And memories of the friends of old, And strong Tradition, binding fast The ‘flying terms’ with bands of gold,— All these hath Oxford: all are dear, But dearer far the little town, The drifting surf, the wintry year, The college of the scarlet gown, St. Andrews by the northern sea, That is a haunted town to me! Freshman's Term Return again, thou Freshman's year, When bloom was on the rye, When breakfast came with bottled beer, When Pleasure walked the High; When Torpid Bumps were more by far To every opening mind Than Trade, or Shares, or Peace, or War, To senior humankind; When ribbons of outrageous hues Were worn with honest pride, When much was talked of boats and crews, When Proctors were defied: When tick was in its early bloom, When Schools were far away, As vaguely distant as the tomb, Nor more regarded—they! When arm was friendly linked with arm Beneath the College limes, When Sunday grinds possessed a charm Denied to College Rhymes: When ices were in much request Beside the April fire, When men were very strangely dressed By Standen or by Prior, Return, ye Freshman's Terms! They do Return, and much the same, To boys, who just like me and you, Play the absurd old game. Ballade of the Summer Term (Being a Petition, in the form of a Ballade, praying the University Commissioners to spare the Summer Term.) When Lent and Responsions are ended, When May with fritillaries waits, When the flower of the chestnut is splendid, When drags are at all of the gates (Those drags the philosopher ‘slates’ With a scorn that is truly sublime), Cf. ‘Suggestions for Academic Reorganization’. Life wins from the grasp of the fates Sweet hours and the fleetest of time! When wickets are bowl'd and defended, When Isis is glad with ‘the Eights’, When music and sunset are blended, When Youth and the summer are mates, When Freshmen are heedless of ‘Greats’, And when note-books are cover'd with rhyme, Ah, these are the hours that one rates— Sweet hours and the fleetest of time! When the brow of the Dean is unbended At luncheons and mild tête-à-têtes, When the Tutor's in love, nor offended By blunders in tenses or dates; When bouquets are purchased of Bates, When the bells in their melody chime, When unheeded the Lecturer prates— Sweet hours and the fleetest of time! Envoy Reformers of Schools and of States, Is mirth so tremendous a crime? Ah! spare what grim pedantry hates— Sweet hours and the fleetest of time! ‘Oh, what should I do there’ Air: ‘The Bush aboon Traquair.’ Oh, what should I do there, In the lately vacant chair Of Mr. Matthew Arnold, by the Isis stream? Where, instead of cushat's coos Is the plashing of canoes, And the coaches curse the crews and the coxes scream. The oars in rowlocks straining, ‘Now, Trinity, you're gaining’: Oh, little should I hear that was worth my heed; I should much prefer to daunder Where the sheep and shepherds wander, And muse, and maybe maunder, by the Tweed. [After J. C. Shairp.] The Singing Rose ‘La Rose qui chante et l'herbe qui égare.’ White Rose on the gray garden wall, Where now no night-wind whispereth, Call to the far-off flowers, and call With murmured breath and musical, Till all the roses hear, and all Sing to my love what the White Rose saith. White Rose on the gray garden wall That long ago we sung! Again you come at summer's call,— Again beneath my windows all With trellised flowers is hung, With clusters of the roses white Like fragrant stars in a green night. Once more I hear the sister towers Each unto each reply, The bloom is on those limes of ours, The weak wind shakes the bloom in showers, Snow from a cloudless sky; There is no change this happy day Within the College gardens gray! St. Mary's, Merton, Magdalen—still Their sweet bells chime and swing, The old years answer them, and thrill A wintry heart against its will With memories of the spring— That spring we sought the gardens through For flowers which ne'er in gardens grew! For we, beside our nurse's knee, In fairy tales had heard Of that strange rose which blossoms free On boughs of an enchanted tree, And sings like any bird! And of the weed beside the way That leadeth lovers' steps astray! In vain we sought the Singing Rose Whereof old legends tell, Alas! we found it not 'mid those Within the gray old College close, That budded, flowered, and fell,— We found that herb called ‘Wandering’ And meet no more, no more in spring. Yes, unawares the unhappy grass That leadeth steps astray We trod, and so it came to pass That never more we twain, alas, Shall walk the self-same way. And each must deem, though neither knows, That neither found the Singing Rose. A Toast Kate Kennedy is the Patron Saint of St. Leonards and St. Salvator. Her history is quite unknown. The learned are all ‘in a swither’, (They don't very often agree,) They know not her ‘whence’ nor her ‘whither’, The Maiden we drink to together, The College's Kate Kennedie! Did she shine in days early or later? Did she ever achieve a degree? Was she pretty or plain? Did she mate, or Live lonely? And who was the pater Of mystical Kate Kennedie? The learned may scorn her and scout her, But true to her colours are we, The learned may mock her and flout her, But surely we'll rally about her, In the College that stands by the sea. So here's to her memory! here to The mystical maiden drink we, We'll pledge her, and we'll persevere too, Though the reason is not very clear to The critical mind, nor to me. Here's to Kate! she's our own, and she's dear to The College that stands by the sea. St. Andrews Bay Night Ah, listen through the music, from the shore, The ‘melancholy long-withdrawing roar’; Beneath the Minster, and the windy caves, The wide North Ocean, marshalling his waves! Even so forlorn—in worlds beyond our ken— May sigh the seas that are not heard of men; Even so forlorn, prophetic of man's fate, Sounded the cold sea-wave disconsolate, When none but God might hear the boding tone, As God shall hear the long lament alone, When all is done, when all the tale is told, And the gray sea-wave echoes as of old! Morning This was the burden of the night, The saying of the sea, But lo! the hours have brought the light, The laughter of the waves, the flight Of dipping sea-birds, foamy white, That are so glad to be! ‘Forget’! the happy creatures cry, ‘Forget night's monotone, With us be glad in sea and sky, The days are thine, the days that fly, The days God gives to know Him by, And not the night alone!’ The End of the Term St. Andrews Farewell: before the winter goes we go, Before the flush of spring, We leave the gardens flaked with foam for snow, Ere the larks dare to sing: Good-bye! the minster gray Must watch it pass away, The flitting colour of the scarlet gown, We shall not see the green above the gray, The summer in the Town. Farewell the long line of the violet hills Beyond the yellow sand, The wide brown level that the water fills Between the sea and land; The sea-birds call and cry On shining sands or dry, Along the foam-fringed marges of the Bay; We shall not see the splendour of July Here—nor the longest day! Farewell! for turning a reluctant face Once more we seek the din, The lurid light on that abhorrent place Of luxury and sin; Farewell! yet once we knew How the brief twilight through The sunset with the sunrise mingled here, Above the grey links and the waters blue In summer of the year. II SCOTLAND Ballade of his own Country I scribbled on a fly-book's leaves Among the shining salmon-flies; A song for summer-time that grieves I scribbled on a fly-book's leaves. Between gray sea and golden sheaves, Beneath the soft wet Morvern skies, I scribbled on a fly-book's leaves, Among the shining salmon-flies. To C. H. A. Let them boast of Arabia, oppressed By the odour of myrrh on the breeze; In the isles of the east and the west That are sweet with the cinnamon trees Let the sandal-wood perfume the seas, Give the roses to Rhodes and to Crete, We are more than content, if you please, With the smell of bog-myrtle and peat! Though Dan Virgil enjoyed himself best With the scent of the limes, when the bees Hummed low 'round the doves in their nest, While the vintagers lay at their ease; Had he sung in our northern degrees, He'd have sought a securer retreat, He'd have dwelt, where the heart of us flees, With the smell of bog-myrtle and peat! Oh, the broom has a chivalrous crest And the daffodil's fair on the leas, And the soul of the southron might rest, And be perfectly happy with these; But we, that were nursed on the knees Of the hills of the north, we would fleet Where our hearts might their longing appease With the smell of bog-myrtle and peat! Envoy Princess, the domain of our quest It is far from the sounds of the street, Where the Kingdom of Galloway's blest With the smell of bog-myrtle and peat! Grass of Parnassus Pale star that by the lochs of Galloway, In wet green places 'twixt the depth and height, Dost keep thine hour while autumn ebbs away, When now the moors have doffed the heather bright, Grass of Parnassus, flower of my delight, How gladly with the unpermitted bay— Garlands not mine, and leaves that not decay— How gladly would I twine thee if I might! The bays are out of reach! But far below The peaks forbidden of the Muses' Hill, Grass of Parnassus, thy returning snow Between September and October chill Doth speak to me of autumns long ago, And these kind faces that are with me still. A Galloway Garland We know not, on these hills of ours, The fabled asphodel of Greece, That filleth with immortal flowers Fields where the heroes are at peace! Not ours are myrtle buds like these That breathe o'er isles where memories dwell Of Sappho, in enchanted seas! We meet not, on our upland moor, The singing Maid of Helicon, You may not hear her music pure Float on the mountain meres withdrawn; The Muse of Greece, the Muse is gone! But we have songs that please us well And flowers we love to look upon. More sweet than southern myrtles far The bruised marsh-myrtle breatheth keen; Parnassus names the flower, the star, That shines among the well-heads green The bright marsh-asphodels between— Marsh-myrtle and marsh-asphodel May crown the northern Muse a queen. A Sunset on Yarrow The wind and the day had lived together, They died together, and far away Spoke farewell in the sultry weather, Out of the sunset, over the heather, The dying wind and the dying day. Far in the south, the summer levin Flushed, a flame in the gray soft air: We seemed to look on the hills of heaven; You saw within, but to me 'twas given To see your face, as an angel's, there. Never again, ah surely never Shall we wait and watch, where of old we stood, The low good-night of the hill and the river, The faint light fade, and the wan stars quiver, Twain grown one in the solitude. Ballade of the Tweed (Lowland Scotch) To T. W. L. The ferox rins in rough Loch Awe, A weary cry frae ony toun; The Spey, that loups o'er linn and fa', They praise a' ither streams aboon; They boast their braes o' bonny Doon: Gie me to hear the ringing reel, Where shilfas sing and cushats croon By fair Tweed-side, at Ashiesteel! There's Ettrick, Meggat, Ail, and a', Where trout swim thick in May and June; Ye'll see them take in showers o' snaw Some blinking, cauldrife April noon: Rax ower the palmer and march-broun, And syne we'll show a bonny creel, In spring or simmer, late or soon, By fair Tweed-side, at Ashiesteel! There's mony a water, great or sma', Gaes singing in his siller tune, Through glen and heugh, and hope and shaw, Beneath the sun-licht or the moon: But set us in our fishing-shoon Between the Caddon-burn and Peel, And syne we'll cross the heather broun By fair Tweed-side at Ashiesteel! Envoy Deil take the dirty, trading loon Wad gar the water ca' his wheel, And drift his dyes and poisons doun By fair Tweed-side at Ashiesteel! April on Tweed As birds are fain to build their nest The first soft sunny day, So longing wakens in my breast A month before the May, When now the wind is from the west, And winter melts away. The snow lies yet on Eildon Hill, But soft the breezes blow. If melting snows the waters fill, We nothing heed the snow, But we must up and take our will— A fishing will we go! Below the branches brown and bare, Beneath the primrose lea, The trout lies waiting for his fare, A hungry trout is he; He's hooked, and springs and splashes there Like salmon from the sea! Oh, April-tide's a pleasant tide, However times may fall, And sweet to welcome spring, the bride, You hear the mavis call; But all adown the water-side The spring's most fair of all Twilight on Tweed Three crests against the saffron sky, Beyond the purple plain, The dear remembered melody Of Tweed once more again. Wan water from the border hills, Dear voice from the old years, Thy distant music lulls and stills, And moves to quiet tears. Like a loved ghost thy fabled flood Fleets through the dusky land; Where Scott, come home to die, has stood, My feet returning stand. A mist of memory broods and floats, The border waters flow; The air is full of ballad notes, Borne out of long ago. Old songs that sung themselves to me, Sweet through a boy's day-dream, While trout below the blossom'd tree Plashed in the golden stream. Twilight, and Tweed, and Eildon Hill, Fair and thrice fair you be; You tell me that the voice is still That should have welcomed me. Ballant o' Ballantrae To Robert Louis Stevenson Written in wet weather, this conveyed to the Master of Ballantrae a wrong idea of a very beautiful and charming place, with links, a river celebrated by Burns, good sea-fishing, and, on the river, a ruined castle at every turn of the stream ‘Try Ballantrae’ is a word of wisdom.

'Twas a day of faith and flowers Of honour that could not die, Of hope that counted the hours, Of sorrowing loyalty: And the blackbird sang in the closes, The blackbird piped in the spring, For the day of the dawn of the roses, The dawn of the day of the King. White roses over the heather, And down by the Lowland lea, And far in the faint blue weather, A white sail guessed on the sea. But the deep night gathers and closes, Shall ever a morning bring The lord of the leal white roses, The face of the rightful King? The Tenth of June, 1715 (Being a Song writ for a lady born on June 10th, the birthday of his Most Sacred Majesty King James III and VIII.) Day of the King and the flower! And the girl of my heart's delight! The blackbird sings in the bower, And the nightingale sings in the night A song to the roses white. Day of the flower and the King! When shall the sails of white Shine on the seas and bring In the day, in the dawn, in the night, The King to his land and his right? Day of my love and my may, After the long years' flight, Born on the King's birthday, Born for my heart's delight, With the dawn of the roses white! Black as the blackbird's wing Is her hair, and her brow as white As the white rose blossoming, And her eyes as the falcon's bright, And her heart is leal to the right. When shall the joy bells ring? When shall the hours unite The right with the might of my King, And my heart with my heart's delight— In the dawn, in the day, in the night? The Prince's Birthday Rome. December 31, 1721 (A new-born star shone, which is figured on an early medal of Prince Charles.) Awonderful star shone forth From the frozen skies of the north Upon Rome for an old year's night: And a flower on the dear white rose Broke, in the season of snows, To bloom for a day's delight. Lost is the star in the night, And the rose of a day's delight Fled ‘where the roses go’: But the fragrance and light from afar, Born of the rose and the star, Breathe over the years and the snow. How they Held the Bass for King James—1691-1693 Time of Narrating—1743. Ye hae heard Whigs crack o' the Saints in the Bass, my faith, a gruesome tale; How the Remnant paid at a tippeny rate, for a quart o' ha'penny ale! But I'll tell ye anither tale o' the Bass, that'll hearten ye up to hear, Sae I pledge ye to Middleton first in a glass, and a health to the Young Chevalier! The Bass stands frae North Berwick Law a league or less to sea, About its feet the breakers beat, abune the seamaws flee, There's castle stark and dungeon dark, wherein the godly lay, That made their rant for the Covenant through mony a weary day. For twal' years lang the caverns rang wi' preaching, prayer, and psalm, Ye'd think the winds were soughing wild, when a' the winds were calm, There wad they preach, each Saint to each, and glower as the soldiers pass, And Peden wared his malison on a bonny leaguer lass, As she stood and daffed, while the warders laughed, and wha sae blithe as she, But a wind o' ill worked his warlock will, and flang her out to sea. Then wha sae bright as the Saints that night, and an angel came, say they, And sang in the cell where the Righteous dwell, but he took na a Saint away. There yet might they be, for nane could flee, and nane daur'd break the jail, And still the sobbing o' the sea might mix wi' their warlock wail; But then came in black echty-echt, and bluidy echtynine, Wi' Cess, and Press, and Presbytery, and a' the dule sin' syne; The Saints won free wi' the power o' the key, and Cavaliers maun pine! It was Halyburton, Middleton, and Roy and young Dunbar, That Livingstone took on Cromdale Haughs, in the last fight of the war: And they were warded in the Bass, till the time they should be slain, Where bluidy Mitchell, and Blackader, and Earlston lang had lain; Four lads alone, 'gainst a garrison, but glory crowns their names, For they brought it to pass that they took the Bass, and they held it for King James! It isna by preaching half the night, ye'll burst a dungeon door; It wasna by dint o' psalmody they broke the hold—they four; For lang years three that rock in the sea bade Wullie Wanbeard William III. gae swing, And England and Scotland fause may be, but the Bass Rock stands for the King! There's but ae pass gangs up the Bass, it's guarded wi' strong gates four, And still as the soldiers went to the sea, they steikit them, door by door, And this did they do when they helped a crew that brought their coals on shore. Thither all had gone, save three men alone: then Middleton gripped his man, Halyburton felled the sergeant lad, Dunbar seized the gunner, Swan; Roy bound their hands, in hempen bands, and the Cavaliers were free. And they trained the guns on the soldier loons that were down wi' the boat by the sea! Then Middleton cried frae the high cliff-side, and his voice garr'd the auld rocks ring, ‘Will ye stand or flee by the land or sea, for I hold the Bass for the King?’ They had nae desire to face the fire; it was mair than men might do, So they e'en sailed back in the auld coal-smack, a sorry and shame-faced crew, And they hirpled doun to Edinburgh toun, wi' the story of their shames, How the prisoners bold had broken hold, and kept the Bass for King James. King James he has sent them guns and men, and the Whigs they guard the Bass, But they never could catch the Cavaliers, who took toll of ships that pass; They fared wild and free as the birds o' the sea, and at night they went on the wing, And they lifted the kye o' Whigs far and nigh, and they revelled and drank to the King. Then Wullie Wanbeard sends his ships to siege the Bass in form, And first shall they break the fortress down, and syne the rock they'll storm. After twa days' fight they fled in the night, and glad eneuch to go, With their rigging rent, and their powder spent, and many a man laid low. So for lang years three did they sweep the sea, but a closer watch was set, Till nae food had they, but twa ounce a day o' meal was the maist they'd get. And men fight but tame on an empty wame, so they sent a flag o' truce, And blithe were the Privy Council then, when the Whigs had heard that news. Twa Lords they sent wi' a strang intent to be dour on each Cavalier, But wi' French cakes fine, and his last drap o' wine, did Middleton make them cheer. On the muzzles o' guns he put coats and caps, and he set them aboot the wa's, And the Whigs thocht then he had food and men to stand for the Rightfu' Cause. So he got a' he craved, and his men were saved, and nane might say them nay, Wi' sword by side, and flag o' pride, free men might they gang their way, They might fare to France, they might bide at hame, and the better their grace to buy, Wullie Wanbeard's purse maun pay the keep o' the men that did him defy! Men never hae gotten sic terms o' peace since first men went to war, As got Halyburton, and Middleton, and Roy, and the young Dunbar. Sae I drink to ye here, To the Young Chevalier! I hae said ye an auld man's say, And there may hae been mightier deeds of arms, but there never was nane sae gay! Kenmure 1715 ‘The heather's in a blaze, Willie, The White Rose decks the tree, The Fiery Cross is on the braes, And the King is on the sea! ‘Remember great Montrose, Willie, Remember fair Dundee, And strike one stroke at the foreign foes Of the King that's on the sea. ‘There's Gordons in the north, Willie, Are rising frank and free, Shall a Kenmure Gordon not go forth For the King that's on the sea? ‘A trusty sword to draw, Willie, A comely weird to dree, For the royal rose that's like the snaw, And the King that's on the sea!’ He cast ae look across his lands, Looked over loch and lea, He took his fortune in his hands, For the King was on the sea. Kenmures have fought in Galloway For Kirk and Presbyt'rie, This Kenmure faced his dying day, For King James across the sea. It little skills what faith men vaunt, If loyal men they be To Christ's ain Kirk and Covenant, Or the King that's o'er the sea. Culloden Dark, dark was the day when we looked on Culloden And chill was the mist drop that clung to the tree, The oats of the harvest hung heavy and sodden, No light on the land and no wind on the sea. There was wind, there was rain, there was fire on their faces, When the clans broke the bayonets and died on the guns, And 'tis Honour that watches the desolate places Where they sleep through the change of the snows and the suns. Unfed and unmarshalled, outworn and outnumbered, All hopeless and fearless, as fiercely they fought, As when Falkirk with heaps of the fallen was cumbered, As when Gledsmuir was red with the havoc they wrought. Ah, woe worth you, Sleat, and the faith that you vowed, Ah, woe worth you, Lovat, Traquair, and Mackay; And woe on the false fairy flag of Macleod, And the fat squires who drank, but who dared not to die! Where the graves of Clan Chattan are clustered together, Where Macgillavray died by the Well of the Dead, We stooped to the moorland and plucked the pale heather That blooms where the hope of the Stuart was sped. And a whisper awoke on the wilderness, sighing, Like the voice of the heroes who battled in vain; ‘Not for Tearlach alone the red claymore was plying, But to bring back the old life that comes not again.’ The Bonnie Banks o' Loch Lomond 1746 There's an ending o' the dance, and fair Morag's safe in France, And the Clans they hae paid the lawing, And the wuddy A euphemism for the hangman's rope or the gallows. has her ain, and we twa are left alane, Free o' Carlisle gaol in the dawing. So ye'll tak the high road, and I'll tak the laigh road, An' I'll be in Scotland before ye: But me and my true love will never meet again, By the bonnie, bonnie banks o' Loch Lomond. For my love's heart brake in twa, when she kenned the Cause's fa', And she sleeps where there's never nane shall waken, Where the glen lies a' in wrack, wi' the houses toom and black, And her father's ha's forsaken. While there's heather on the hill shall my vengeance ne'er be still, While a bush hides the glint o' a gun, lad; Wi' the men o' Sergeant Môr shall I work to pay the score, Till I wither on the wuddy in the sun, lad! So ye'll tak the high road, and I'll tak the laigh road, An' I'll be in Scotland before ye: But me and my true love will never meet again, By the bonnie, bonnie banks o' Loch Lomond. Lone Places of the Deer Lone places of the deer, Corrie, and Loch, and Ben, Fount that wells in the cave, Voice of the burn and the wave, Softly you sing and clear Of Charlie and his men. Here has he lurked, and here The heather has been his bed, The wastes of the islands knew, And the Highland hearts were true To the bonny, the brave, the dear, The royal, the hunted head. Red and White Roses Red roses under the sun For the King who is lord of land; But he dies when his day is done, For his memory careth none When the glass runs empty of sand. White roses under the moon For the King without lands to give; But he reigns with the rose in June, With the rose and the blackbird's tune, And he lives while Faith shall live. Red roses for beef and beer; Red roses for wine and gold; But they drank of the water clear, In exile and sorry cheer, To the kings of our sires of old. Red roses for wealth and might; White roses for hopes that flee; And the dreams of the day and the night, For the lord of our heart's delight— For the King that is o'er the sea. Three Portraits of Prince Charles 1731 Beautiful face of a child, Lighted with laughter and glee, Mirthful and tender and wild, My heart is heavy for thee! 1744 Beautiful face of a youth, As an eagle poised to fly forth, To the old land loyal of truth, To the hills and the sounds of the north: Fair face, daring and proud, Lo! the shadow of doom, even now, The fate of thy line, like a cloud, Rests on the grace of thy brow! 1773 Cruel and angry face! Hateful and heavy with wine, Where are the gladness, the grace, The beauty, the mirth that were thine? Ah, my Prince, it were well— Hadst thou to the gods been dear— To have fallen where Keppoch fell, With the war-pipe loud in thine ear! To have died with never a stain On the fair White Rose of renown, To have fallen, fighting in vain, For thy father, thy faith, and thy crown! More than thy marble pile, With its women weeping for thee, Were to dream in thine ancient isle, To the endless dirge of the sea! But the fates deemed otherwise, Far thou sleepest from home, From the tears of the northern skies, In the secular dust of Rome. A city of death and the dead, But thither a pilgrim The ‘pilgrim’ was, of course, Sir Walter Scott. came, Wearing on weary head The crowns of years and fame: Little the Lucrine lake Or Tivoli said to him, Scarce did the memories wake Of the far-off years and dim. For he stood by Avernus' shore, But he dreamed of a northern glen And he murmured, over and o'er, ‘For Charlie and his men’: And his feet, to death that went, Crept forth to St. Peter's shrine, And the latest minstrel bent O'er the last of the Stuart line. An Old Song 1750. Oh, it's hame, hame, hame, And it's hame I wadna be, Till the Lord calls King James To his ain countrie; Bids the wind blaw frae France, Till the Firth keps the faem, And Loch Garry and Lochiel Bring Prince Charlie hame. May the lads Prince Charlie led That were hard on Willie's track, When frae Laffen One verse and the refrain are of 1750 or thereabouts. At Laffen, where William, Duke of Cumberland, was defeated and nearly captured by the Scots and Irish in the French service, Prince Charles is said to have served as a volunteer. field he fled, Wi' the claymore at his back; May they stand on Scottish soil When the White Rose bears the gree, And the Lord calls the King To his ain countrie! Bid the seas arise and stand Like walls on ilka side, Till our Highland lad pass through With Jehovah for his guide. Dry up the river Forth, As Thou didst the Red Sea, When Israel cam hame To his ain countrie. Jacobite ‘Auld Lang Syne’ Shall ancient freedom be forgot And the auld Stuart line? Shall ancient freedom be forgot And Auld Lang Syne? Though now we take King Louis' fee And drink King Louis' wine, We'll bring the King frae o'er the sea For Auld Lang Syne. We twa hae waded deep in blood, And broke the red-coat line, And forded Eden white in flood For Auld Lang Syne. And we hae fought the English coofs Frae Garry to the Rhine, Frae Gledsmuir to the field o' Val In Auld Lang Syne. The Butcher wi' the deil shall drink And wi' the deevil dine, But Charles shall dine in Holyrood For Auld Lang Syne. For He wha did proud Pharaoh crush And save auld Jacob's line, Shall speak wi' Charlie in the Bush Like Moses, lang syne. The Last of the Leal Here's a health to every man Bore the brunt of wind and weather; Winnowed sore by fortune's fan, Faded faith of chief and clan: Nairne and Caryl stand together; Here's a health to every man Bore the brunt of wind and weather! Oh, round Charlie many ran, When his foot was on the heather, When his sword shone in the van. Now, at ending of his span, Gask and Caryl stand together! Ne'er a hope from plot or plan, Ne'er a hope from rose or heather; Ay, the King's a broken man; Few will bless, and most will ban. Nairne and Caryl stand together! Help is none from Crown or clan, France is false—a fluttered feather; But Kings are not made by man, Till God end what God began, Nairne and Caryl stand together, Gask and Caryl stand together; Here's a health to every man Bore the brunt of wind and weather! A Scot to Jeanne d'Arc NOTE TO ‘A SCOT TO JEANNE D'ARC’ Jeanne d'Arc is said to have led a Scottish force at Lagny, when she defeated the Burgundian, Franquet d'Arras. A Scottish artist painted her banner; he was a James Polwarth, or Power or a Hume of Polwarth, according to a conjecture of Mr. Hill Burton's. A monk of Dunfermline, who continued Fordun's Chronicle, avers that he was with the Maiden in her campaigns, and at her martyrdom. He calls her Puella a spiritu sancto excitata. Unluckily his manuscript breaks off in the middle of a sentence. At her trial, Jeanne said that she had only once seen her own portrait: it was in the hands of a Scottish archer. The story of the white dove which passed from her lips as they opened to her last cry of Jesus! was reported at the trial for her Rehabilitation (1450-56). Two archers of the name of Lang, Lain or Laing were in the French service about 1507. See the book on the Scottish Guard by Father Forbes Leith. Dark Lily without blame, Not upon us the shame, Whose sires were to the Auld Alliance true; They, by the Maiden's side, Victorious fought and died, One stood by thee that fiery torment through, Till the White Dove from thy pure lips had passed, And thou wert with thine own St. Catherine at the last. Once only didst thou see, In artist's imagery, Thine own face painted, and that precious thing Was in an Archer's hand From the leal northern land. Alas, what price would not thy people bring To win that portrait of the ruinous Gulf of devouring years that hide the Maid from us! Born of a lowly line, Noteless as once was thine, One of that name I would were kin to me, Who, in the Scottish Guard Won this for his reward, To fight for France, and memory of thee: Not upon us, dark Lily without blame, Not on the north may fall the shadow of that shame. On France and England both The shame of broken troth, Of coward hate and treason black must be; If England slew thee, France Sent not one word, one lance, One coin to rescue or to ransom thee. And still thy Church unto the Maid denies The halo and the palms, the Beatific prize. Since these lines were written, the Maid has been canonized. But yet thy people calls Within the rescued walls Of Orleans; and makes its prayer to thee; What though the Church hath chidden These orisons forbidden, Yet art thou with this earth's immortal Three, With him in Athens, that of hemlock died, And with thy Master dear whom the world crucified. Jeanne d'Arc The honour of a loyal boy, The courage of a paladin, With maiden's mirth, the soul of joy, These dwelt her happy breast within. From shame, from doubt, from fear, from sin, As God's own angels was she free; Old worlds shall end and new begin To be, Ere any come like her who fought For France, for freedom, for the King; Who counsel of redemption brought Whence even the armed Archangel's wing Might weary sore in voyaging; Who heard her Voices cry ‘Be free!’ Such Maid no later human spring Shall see! Saints Michael, Catherine, Margaret, Who sowed the seed that thou must reap, If eyes of angels may be wet, And if the Saints have leave to weep, In Paradise one pain they keep, Maiden! one mortal memory, One sorrow that can never sleep, For thee! How the Maid marched from Blois (Supposed to be narrated by James Power, or Polwarth, her Scottish banner-painter.) The Maiden called for her great destrier, But he lashed like a fiend when the Maid drew near: ‘Lead him forth to the Cross!’ she cried, and he stood Like a steed of bronze by the Holy Rood! Then I saw the Maiden mount and ride, With a good steel sperthe that swung by her side, And girt with the sword of the Heavenly Bride, That is sained with crosses five for a sign, The mystical sword of St. Catherine. And the lily banner was blowing wide, With the flowers of France on the field of fame, And, blent with the blossoms, the Holy Name! And the Maiden's bearings were shown on a shield, Argent, a dove, on an azure field; That banner was wrought by his hand, ye see, For the love of the Maid and chivalry. Her banner was borne by a page of grace, With hair of gold, and a lady's face; And behind it the ranks of her men were dressed— Never a man but was clean confessed, Jackman and archer, lord and knight, Their souls were clean and their hearts were light: There was never an oath, there was never a laugh, And La Hire swore soft by his leading staff! Had we died in that hour we had won the skies, And the Maiden had marched us through Paradise! A moment she turned to the people there, Who had come to gaze on the Maiden fair; A moment she glanced at the ring she wore, She murmured the Holy Name it bore, Then, ‘For France and the King, good people pray!’ She spoke, and she cried to us, ‘On and away!’ And the shouts broke forth, and the flowers rained down, And the Maiden led us to Orleans town. DEEDS OF MEN Seekers for a City ‘Believe me, if that blissful, that beautiful place, were set on a hill visible to all the world, I should long ago have journeyed thither . . . But the number and variety of the ways! For you know, There is but one road that leads to Corinth.’—Hermotimus (Mr. Pater's Version). ‘The Poet says dear city of Cecrops, and wilt thou not say, dear city of Zeus?’—M. Antoninus. To Corinth leads one road, you say: Is there a Corinth, or a way? Each bland or blatant preacher hath His painful or his primrose path, And not a soul of all of these But knows the city 'twixt the seas, Her fair unnumbered homes and all Her gleaming amethystine wall! Blind are the guides who know the way, The guides who write, and preach, and pray; I watch their lives, and I divine They differ not from yours and mine! One man we knew, and only one, Whose seeking for a city's done, For what he greatly sought he found, A city girt with fire around, A city in an empty land Between the wastes of sky and sand, A city on a river-side, Where by the folk he loved, he died. January 26, 1885. Alas! it is not ours to tread That path wherein his life he led, Not ours his heart to dare and feel, Keen as the fragrant Syrian steel; Yet are we not quite city-less, Not wholly left in our distress— Is it not said by One of old, Sheep have I of another fold? Ah! faint of heart, and weak of will, For us there is a city still! Dear city of Zeus, the Stoic says, M. Antoninus, iv. 23. The Voice from Rome's imperial days, In Thee meet all things, and disperse, In Thee, for Thee, O Universe! To me all's fruit thy seasons bring, Alike thy summer and thy spring; The winds that wail, the suns that burn, From Thee proceed, to Thee return. Dear city of Zeus, shall we not say, Home to which none can lose the way? Born in that city's flaming bound, We do not find her, but are found. Within her wide and viewless wall The Universe is girdled all. All joys and pains, all wealth and dearth, All things that travail on the earth, God's will they work, if God there be, If not, what is my life to me? Seek we no further, but abide Within this city great and wide. In her and for her living, we Have no less joy than to be free; Nor death nor grief can quite appal The folk that dwell within her wall, Nor aught but with our will befall! The White Pacha Vain is the dream! However hope may rave, He perished with the folk he could not save; And though none surely told us he is dead, And though perchance another in his stead— Another, not less brave, when all was done, Had fled unto the southward and the sun, Had urged a way by force, or won by guile To streams remotest of the secret Nile, Had raised an army of the desert men, And, waiting for his hour, had turned again And fallen on that False Prophet, yet we know Gordon is dead, and these things are not so! Nay, not for England's cause, nor to restore Her trampled flag—for he loved honour more— Nay, not for life, revenge, or victory, Would he have fled, whose hour had dawned to die. He will not come again, whate'er our need; He will not come, who is happy, being freed From the deathly flesh and perishable things, And lies of statesmen and rewards of kings. Nay, somewhere by the Sacred River's shore He sleeps like those who shall return no more, No more return for all the prayers of men— Arthur and Charles—they never come again! They shall not wake, though fair the vision seem, Whate'er sick hope may whisper, vain the dream! Midnight, January 25, 1886 To-morrow is a year since Gordon died! A year ago to-night, the desert still Crouched on the spring, and panted for its fill Of lust and blood. Their old art statesmen plied, And paltered, and evaded, and denied; Guiltless as yet, except for feeble will, And craven heart, and calculated skill In long delays, of their great homicide. A year ago to-night 'twas not too late. The thought comes through our mirth—again, again; Methinks I hear the halting foot of fate Approaching and approaching us; and then Comes cackle of the House, and the debate! Enough; he is forgotten amongst men. England ‘We are rather disposed to laugh when poets or orators try to conjure with the name of England.’—Professor Seeley. When Nelson's sudden signal came Men's hearts leaped up the word to hail: Not vainly with his England's name He ‘conjured’, but to some avail! When o'er the Birkenhead her fate Closed, and our men arose to die, The name of England yet was great, And yet upheld their hearts on high. For England's honour Gordon chose, When England would not guard her own, Serene amidst a world of foes, Alone to live, to die alone. But that great name, to Milton dear, Of England's ocean-circled isle, The voters greet it with a jeer, The witling sniffs it with a smile. Well, if indeed that name no more Must, like a trumpet, stir the blood; Of all our fathers wrought and bore For England, on the field and flood; If naught endures, if all must pass, Then speed the hour when we shall be, Unmoved, unshamed beneath the grass, Deaf to the mountains and the sea! Deaf to the voices Wordsworth heard Reverberant from height and deep; Dull to the sights and sounds that stirred Our fathers; heedless and asleep. For so, at least, we shall nor hear The noises from the Meetings borne, Where England's children, with a sneer, Hail ‘England’ as a word of scorn.

You, like that fairy people set Of old in their enchanted sea Far off from men, might well forget An elder nation's toil and fret, Might heed not aught but game and glee. But what your fathers were—you are In lands the fathers never knew, 'Neath skies of alien sign and star You rally to the English war; Your hearts are English, kind and true.

Thou that on every field of earth and sky Didst hunt for death, who seemed to flee and fear— How great and greatly fallen dost thou lie Slain in the desert by some wandering spear: ‘Not here, alas!’ may England say, ‘not here, Nor in this quarrel was it meet to die, But in that dreadful battle drawing nigh To thunder through the Afghan passes sheer, Like Aias by the ships shouldst thou have stood, And in some glen have stayed the stream of flight, The bulwark of thy people and their shield, When Indus or when Helmund ran with blood; Till back into the northland and the night The smitten eagle scattered from the field.’ Melville and Coghill (The Place of the Little Hand) Dead, with their eyes to the foe; Dead, with the foe at their feet, Under the sky laid low Truly their slumber is sweet, Though the wind from the Camp of the Slain Men blow, And the rain on the wilderness beat.

Honour we give them and tears, And the flag they died to save, Rent from the rain of the spears, Wet from the war and the wave, Shall waft men's thoughts through the dust of the years, Back to their lonely grave!

IV HESPEROTHEN By the example of certain Grecian mariners, who, being safely returned from the war about Troy, leave yet again their own lands and gods, seeking they know not what, and choosing neither to abide in the fair Phæacian island, nor to dwell and die with the Sirens, at length end miserably in a desert country by the sea, is set forth the Vanity of Melancholy. And by the land of Phæacia is to be understood the place of Art and of fair Pleasures; and by Circe's Isle, the places of bodily delights, whereof men, falling aweary, attain to Eld, and to the darkness of that age. Which thing Master Francoys Rabelais feigned, under the similitude of the Isle of the Macræones. The Seekers for Phæacia There is a land in the remotest day, Where the soft night is born, and sunset dies; The eastern shores see faint tides fade away, That wash the lands where laughter, tears, and sighs, Make life—the lands beneath the blue of common skies. But in the west is a mysterious sea, (What sails have seen it, or what shipmen known?) With coasts enchanted where the Sirens be, With islands where a goddess walks alone, And in the cedar trees the magic winds make moan. Eastward the human cares of house and home, Cities, and ships, and unknown gods, and loves; Westward, strange maidens fairer than the foam, And lawless lives of men, and haunted groves, Wherein a god may dwell, and where the dryad roves. The gods are careless of the days and death Of toilsome men, beyond the western seas; The gods are heedless of their painful breath, And love them not, for they are not as these; But in the golden west they live and lie at ease. Yet the Phæacians well they love, who live At the light's limit, passing careless hours, Most like the gods; and they have gifts to give, Even wine, and fountains musical, and flowers, And song, and if they will, swift ships, and magic powers. It is a quiet midland; in the cool Of twilight comes the god, though no man prayed, To watch the maids and young men beautiful Dance, and they see him, and are not afraid, For they are near of kin to gods, and undismayed. Ah, would the bright red prows might bring us nigh The dreamy isles that the immortals keep! But with a mist they hide them wondrously, And far the path and dim to where they sleep— The loved, the shadowy lands along the shadowy deep. A Song of Phæacia The languid sunset, mother of roses, Lingers, a light on the magic seas; The wide fire flames, as a flower uncloses, Heavy with odour, and loose to the breeze The red rose clouds, without law or leader, Gather and float in the airy plain; The nightingale sings to the dewy cedar, The cedar scatters his scent to the main. The strange flowers' perfume turns to singing, Heard afar over moonlit seas; The Sirens' song, grown faint in winging, Falls in scent on the cedar trees. As waifs blown out of the sunset, flying, Purple, and rosy, and gray, the birds Brighten the air with their wings; their crying Wakens a moment the weary herds. Butterflies flit from the fairy garden, Living blossoms of flying flowers; Never the nights with winter harden, Nor moons wax keen in this land of ours. Great fruits, fragrant, green and golden, Gleam in the green, and droop and fall; Blossom, and bud, and flower unfolden, Swing, and cling to the garden wall. Deep in the woods as twilight darkens, Glades are red with the scented fire; Far in the dells the white maid hearkens, Song and sigh of the heart's desire. Ah! and as moonlight fades in morning, Maiden's song in the matin gray, Faints as the first bird's note, a warning, Wakes and wails to the new-born day. The waking song and the dying measure Meet, and the waxing and waning light Meet, and faint with the hours of pleasure, The rose of the sea and the sky is white. The Departure from Phæacia The Phæacians Why from the dreamy meadows, More fair than any dream, Why will you seek the shadows Beyond the ocean stream? Through straits of storm and peril, Through firths unsailed before, Why make you for the sterile, The dark Kimmerian shore? There no bright streams are flowing, There day and night are one, No harvest time, no sowing, No sight of any sun; No sound of song or tabor, No dance shall greet you there; No noise of mortal labour, Breaks on the blind chill air. Are ours not happy places, Where gods with mortals trod? Saw not our sires the faces Of many a present god? The Seekers Nay, now no god comes hither, In shape that men may see; They fare we know not whither, We know not what they be. Yea, though the sunset lingers Far in your fairy glades, Though yours the sweetest singers, Though yours the kindest maids, Yet here be the true shadows, Here in the doubtful light; Amid the dreamy meadows No shadow haunts the night. We seek a city splendid, With light beyond the sun; Or lands where dreams are ended, And works and days are done. A Ballade of Departure From the Romaic. Fair white bird, what song art thou singing In wintry weather of lands o'er sea? Dear white bird, what way art thou winging, Where no grass grows, and no green tree? I looked at the far-off fields and gray, There grew no tree but the cypress tree, That bears sad fruits with the flowers of May, And whoso looks on it, woe is he. And whoso eats of the fruit thereof Has no more sorrow, and no more love; And who sets the same in his garden stead, In a little space he is waste and dead. They Hear the Sirens for the Second Time The weary sails a moment slept, The oars were silent for a space, As past Hesperian shores we swept, That were as a remembered face Seen after lapse of hopeless years, In Hades, when the shadows meet, Dim through the mist of many tears, And strange, and though a shadow, sweet. So seemed the half-remembered shore, That slumbered, mirrored in the blue, With havens where we touched of yore, And ports that over well we knew. Then broke the calm before a breeze That sought the secret of the west; And listless all we swept the seas Towards the Islands of the Blest. Beside a golden sanded bay We saw the Sirens; very fair The flowery hill whereon they lay, The flowers set upon their hair. Their old sweet song came down the wind, Remembered music waxing strong, Ah, now no need of cords to bind, No need had we of orphic song. It once had seemed a little thing, To lay our lives down at their feet, That dying we might hear them sing, And dying see their faces sweet; But now, we glanced and, passing by, No care had we to tarry long; Faint hope, and rest, and memory Were more than any Siren's song. Circe's Isle Revisited Ah, Circe, Circe! in the wood we cried; Ah, Circe, Circe! but no voice replied; No voice from bowers o'ergrown and ruinous As fallen rocks upon the mountain side. There was no sound of singing in the air; Faded or fled the maidens that were fair, No more for sorrow or joy were seen of us, No light of laughing eyes, or floating hair. The perfume, and the music, and the flame Had passed away; the memory of shame Alone abode, and stings of faint desire, And pulses of vague quiet went and came. Ah, Circe! in thy sad changed fairy place, Our dead Youth came and looked on us a space, With drooping wings, and eyes of faded fire, And wasted hair about a weary face. Why had we ever sought the magic isle That seemed so happy in the days erewhile? Why did we ever leave it, where we met A world of happy wonders in one smile? Back to the westward and the waning light We turned, we fled; the solitude of night Was better than the infinite regret, In fallen places of our dead delight. The Limit of Lands Between the circling ocean sea And the poplars of Persephone There lies a strip of barren sand, Flecked with the sea's last spray, and strown With waste leaves of the poplars, blown Form gardens of the shadow land. With altars of old sacrifice The shore is set, in mournful wise The mists upon the ocean brood; Between the water and the air The clouds are born that float and fare Between the water and the wood. Upon the gray sea never sail Of mortals passed within our hail, Where the last weak waves faint and flow; We heard within the poplar pale The murmur of a doubtful wail Of voices loved so long ago. We scarce had care to die or live, We had no honey cake to give, No wine of sacrifice to shed; There lies no new path over sea, And now we know how faint they be, The feasts and voices of the dead. Ah, flowers and dance! ah, sun and snow! Glad life, sad life we did forgo To dream of quietness and rest; Ah, would the fleet sweet roses here Poured light and perfume through the drear Pale year, and wan land of the west. Sad youth, that let the spring go by Because the spring is swift to fly, Sad youth, that feared to mourn or love; Behold how sadder far is this, To know that rest is nowise bliss, And darkness is the end thereof. V BOOKS To the Gentle Reader ‘A French writer (whom I love well) speaks of three kinds of companions—men, women, and books.’—Sir John Davys. Three kinds of companions—men, women, and books, Were enough, said the elderly sage, for his ends. And the women we deem that he chose for their looks, And the men for their cellars: the books were his friends: ‘Man delights me not’, often, ‘nor woman’, but books Are the best of good comrades in loneliest nooks. For man will be wrangling—for woman will fret About anything infinitesimal small: Like the sage in our Plato, I'm ‘anxious to get On the side’—on the sunnier side—‘of a wall’. Let the wind of the world toss the nations like rooks, If only you'll leave me at peace with my books! And which are my books? why, ’tis much as you please, For, given 'tis a book, it can hardly be wrong, And Bradshaw himself I can study with ease, Though for choice I might call for a sermon or song; And Locker on London, and Sala on cooks, ‘Tom Brown’, and Plotinus, they're all of them books. There's Fielding to lap one in currents of mirth; There's Herrick to sing of a flower or a fay; Or good Maître Francoys to bring one to earth, If Shelley or Coleridge have snatched one away: There's Müller on speech, there is Gurney on spooks, There is Tylor on totems, there's all sorts of books. There's roaming in regions where every one's been, Encounters where no one was ever before, There's ‘Leaves’ from the Highlands we owe to the Queen, There's Holly's and Leo's adventures in Kôr: There's Tanner who dwelt with Pawnees and Chinooks, You can cover a great deal of country in books. There are books, highly thought of, that nobody reads, There is Geusius’ dearly delectable tome Of the Cannibal—he on his neighbour who feeds— And in blood-red morocco 'tis bound, by Derome; There's Montaigne here (a Foppens), there's Roberts Of billiard fame. (on flukes), There's Elzevirs, Aldines, and Gryphius' books. There's Bunyan, there's Walton, in early editions, There's many a quarto uncommonly rare; There's quaint old Quevedo adream with his visions, There's Johnson the portly, and Burton the spare; There's Boston of Ettrick, who preached of the ‘crooks In the lots’ of us mortals, who bargain for books. There's Ruskin to keep one exclaiming ‘What next?’ There's Browning to puzzle, and Gilbert to chaff, And Marcus Aurelius to soothe one if vexed, And good Marcus Tvainus to lend you a laugh; There be capital tomes that are filled with fly-hooks, And I've frequently found them the best kind of Books. Ballade of the Book-hunter In torrid heats of late July, In March, beneath the bitter lise, He book-hunts while the loungers fly— He book-hunts, though December freeze; In breeches baggy at the knees, And heedless of the public jeers, For these, for these, he hoards his fees— Aldines, Bodonis, Elzevirs. No dismal stall escapes his eye, He turns o'er tomes of low degrees; There soiled romanticists may lie, Or Restoration comedies. Each tract that flutters in the breeze For him is charged with hopes and fears; In mouldy novels fancy sees Aldines, Bodonis, Elzevirs. With restless eyes that peer and spy, Sad eyes that heed not skies nor trees, In dismal nooks he loves to pry, Whose motto evermore is—spes! But ah! the fabled treasure flees; Grown rarer with the fleeting years, In rich men's shelves they take their ease— Aldines, Bodonis, Elzevirs! Envoy Prince, all the things that tease and please— Fame, hope, wealth, kisses, cheers, and tears— What are they but such toys as these— Aldines, Bodonis, Elzevirs? Ballade of the Bookman's Paradise There is a Heaven, or here, or there A Heaven there is, for me and you, Where bargains meet for purses spare Like ours, are not so far and few. Thuanus' bees go humming through The learnèd groves, 'neath rainless skies, O'er volumes old and volumes new, Within that Bookman's Paradise. There, treasures bound for Longepierre Keep brilliant their morocco blue, There Hooke's Amanda is not rare, Nor early tracts upon Peru! Racine is common as Rotrou, No Shakespeare quarto search defies, And Caxtons grow as blossoms grow, Within that Bookman's Paradise. There's Eve—not our first mother fair— But Clovis Eve, a binder true; Thither does Bauzonnet repair, Derome, Le Gascon, Padeloup! But never come the cropping crew That dock a volume's honest size, Nor they that ‘letter’ backs askew, Within that Bookman's Paradise. Envoy Friend, do not Heber and de Thou, And Scott, and Southey, kind and wise, La chasse au bouquin still pursue Within that Bookman's Paradise. To F. L.-L. [Frederick Locker-Lampson.] I mind that Forest Shepherd's saw, For, when men preached of Heaven, quoth he— ‘It's a' that's bricht, and a' that's braw, But Bourhope's guid eneuch for me!’ Beneath the green deep-bosomed hills That guard Saint Mary's Loch it lies; The silence of the pastures fills That shepherd's homely paradise. Enough for him his mountain lake, His glen the burn went singing through; And Rowfant, when the thrushes wake, May well seem good enough for you. For all is old, and tried, and dear, And all is fair; and round about The brook that murmurs from the mere Is dimpled with the rising trout. But when the skies of shorter days Are dark and all the ways are mire, How bright upon your books the blaze Gleams from the cheerful study fire. On quartos where our fathers read, Enthralled, the book of Shakespeare's play; On all that Poe could dream of dread, And all that Herrick sang of gay! Fair first editions, duly prized, Above them all, methinks, I rate The tome where Walton's hand revised His wonderful receipts for bait! Happy, who rich in toys like these Forgets a weary nation's ills; Who from his study window sees The circle of the Sussex hills! The Rowfant Books Ballade en Guise de Rondeau The Rowfant books, how fair they show, The quarto quaint, the Aldine tall, Print, autograph, portfolio! Back from the outer air they call The athletes from the tennis ball, This rhymer from his rod and hooks; Would I could sing them one and all, The Rowfant books! The Rowfant books! In sun and snow They're dear, but most when tempests fall; The folio towers above the row As once, o'er minor prophets—Saul! What jolly jest books and what small ‘Dear dumpy twelves’ to fill the nooks. You do not find on every stall The Rowfant books! The Rowfant books! These long ago Were chained within some college hall; These manuscripts retain the glow Of many a coloured capital; While yet the Satires keep their gall, While the Pastissier puzzles cooks, Theirs is a joy that does not pall, The Rowfant books! Envoy The Rowfant books—ah magical As famed Armida's ‘golden looks’, They hold the rhymer for their thrall— The Rowfant books. Verses inscribed in the Supplement to the Rowfant Catalogue 1902 How often to the worthy sire Succeeds the unworthy son! Extinguished is the ancient fire, Books were the idol of the squire, The graceless heir has none. To Sotheby's go old and new, Bindings and prose and rhymes, With Shakespeare as with Padeloup The sporting lord has naught to do— He reads the Sporting Times. Behold a special act of grace; On Rowfants' shelves behold The well-loved volumes keep their place And new-born glories half efface The splendours of the old. Doris's Books Doris, on your shelves I note Many a grave ancestral tome. These, perhaps, you have by rote; These are constantly at home. Ah, but many a gap I spy Where Miss Broughton's novels lie! Doris, there, behind the glass, On your Sheratonian shelves— Oft I see them as I pass— Stubbs and Freeman sun themselves. All unread I watch them stand; That's Belinda in your hand! Doris, I, as you may know, Am myself a Man of Letters, But my learnèd volumes go To the top shelf, like my betters, High—so high that Doris could Scarce get at them if she would! Doris, there be books of mine That I gave you, wrote your name in, Tooled and gilded, fair and fine: Don't you ever peep the same in? Yes, I see you've kept them—but, Doris, they are ‘Quite Uncut!’ Quite uncut, ‘unopened’ rather Are mine edifying pages; From this circumstance I gather That some other Muse engages, Doris, your misguided fancy: Yes, I thought so—reading Nancy. Well, when you are older, Doris, Wiser, too, you'll love my verses; Celia likes them, and, what more is, Oft—to me—their praise rehearses. ‘Celia's Thirty’, did I hear? Doris, too, can be severe! Ode on the Distant Prospect of a New Novel On August 28 The advertisements state, If your wiring from Moscow or Delhi, You will not be too late For a chance of the great New book by Miss Marie Corelli. On August 28 It will come like a spate, (Not so came the poems of Shelley,) And we anticipate That our joy will be great In the work of Miss Marie Corelli. At the stations the boys With exuberant noise To purchase the book will compel ye; While tyrants will pale At the sight of the tale That is launched for Miss Marie Corelli. For her ‘Temporal Power’ Cometh up like a flower, Rose-red with the hues of Crivelli; And I'd not be a king If she's having a fling At the sceptre—Miss Marie Corelli. Perhaps she'll let down The sceptre and crown And not beat the throne to a jelly, And each excellent king May have reason to sing To the praise of Miss Marie Corelli. Were I Kaiser or Tsar I'd give Garter and Star— And my robes for the rags of Cleg Kelly, If Republican rage Is inspiring the page Of the dauntless Miss Marie Corelli! A Mes Livres From Colletet My books, my heart's delight beware Of quitting the domestic shelves! I say when folk would bid me lend, ‘My books are wives to me, my friend; You may admire them, if you care; But no, they never lend themselves!’ From Colletet Such is the fate of borrowed books: they're lost, Or not the book returneth, but its ghost! Ballade of Railway Novels Let others praise analysis And revel in a ‘cultured’ style, And follow the subjective miss From Boston to the banks of Nile, Rejoice in anti-British bile, And weep for fickle hero's woe; These twain have shortened many a mile, Miss Braddon and Gaboriau! These damsels of ‘Democracy's’, These lines do not apply to Miss Annie P. (or Daisy) Miller, and her delightful sisters, Gades aditura mecum, in the pocket edition of Mr. James's novels, if ever I go to Gades How long they stop at every stile! They smile, and we are told, I wis, Ten subtle reasons why they smile. Give me your villains deeply vile, Give me Lecoq, Jottrat and Co., Great artists of the ruse and wile, Miss Braddon and Gaboriau! O novel readers, tell me this, Can prose that's polished by the file, Like great Boisgobey's mysteries, Wet days and weary ways beguile, And man to living reconcile, Like these whose every trick we know? The agony how high they pile, Miss Braddon and Gaboriau! Envoy Ah, friend, how many and many a while They've made the slow time fleetly flow, And solaced pain and charmed exile, Miss Braddon and Gaboriau. The Property of a Gentleman who has given up Collecting. Oh blessèd be the cart that takes Away my books—! my curse, my clog; Blessèd the auctioneer who makes Their inefficient catalogue. Blessèd the purchasers who pay However little—less were fit; Blessèd the rooms, the rainy day, The knock-out and the end of it. For I am weary of the sport, That seemed a while agone so sweet, Of Elzevirs an inch too short, And first editions—incomplete. Weary of crests and coats of arms ‘Attributed to Padeloup’, The sham Deromes have lost their charms, The things Le Gascon did not do. I never read the catalogues Of rubbish that come thick as rooks, But most I loathe the dreary dogs That write in prose, or worse, on books. Large paper surely cannot hide Their grammar, nor excuse their rhyme, The anecdotes that they provide Are older than the dawn of time. Ye bores, of every shape and size, Who make a tedium of delight, Good-bye, the last of my good-byes. Good-night to all your clan, good-night. Thus in a sullen fit we swore, But on mature reflection, Went on collecting more and more— And kept our old collection! Beauty and the Beast The seeds of flowers from isle to isle The birds have brought, the winds have blown; The faces of our daisies smile In meadows of the lands unknown; And tales our fathers told erewhile Like flowers through all the world are sown. The lover strange, the lady's woe, The Prince enchanted and released— The tale 'neath Himalayan snow Was chanted by the Vedic priest, Urvasi and Pururavas are the persons in the Vedic version of Beauty and the Beast. The Kaffir version is in Callaway's Tales from the Amazulu. (Note by A. L.) And little Kaffir children know Their Kaffir Beauty and the Beast. And here, for English children, here By him who best knew Fairyland, ‘Him who best knew Fairyland’ is Dicky Doyle, whose picture of Beauty and the Beast these verses illustrate. [See Christmas Number of Longman's Magazine for 1884.] Are drawn the gentle Beauty dear And (changed by the enchanter's wand) The Beast, unbending o'er his bier, His tail caressed by Beauty's hand. Ah, maidens, mark the moral old! From ugliness you need not wince, Nor turn a cruel face and cold On men who're not Apollos, since Plain lovers may have hearts of gold, The Husband prove the Fairy Prince. Ballade of his Books Here stand my books, line upon line They reach the roof, and row by row, They speak of faded tastes of mine, And things I did, but do not, know: Old school books, useless long ago, Old Logics, where the spirit, railed in, Could scarcely answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’— The many things I've tried and failed in! Here's Villon, in morocco fine, (The poet starved, in mud and snow,) Glatigny does not crave to dine, And René's tears forget to flow; And here's a work by Mrs. Crowe, With hosts of ghosts and bogies jailed in; Ah, all my ghosts have gone below— The many things I've tried and failed in! He's touched, this mouldy Greek divine, The Princess D'Este's hand of snow; And here the arms of D'Hoym shine, And there's a tear-bestained Rousseau: Here's Carlyle shrieking ‘woe on woe’ (The first edition, this, he wailed in); I once believed in him—but oh, The many things I've tried and failed in! Envoy Prince, tastes may differ; mine and thine Quite other balances are scaled in; May you succeed, though I repine— ‘The many things I've tried and failed in!’ Ballade of the Unattainable The Books I cannot hope to buy, Their phantoms round me waltz and wheel; They pass before the dreaming eye, Ere sleep the dreaming eye can seal. A kind of literary reel They dance; how fair the bindings shine! Prose cannot tell them what I feel— The books that never can be mine! There frisk editions rare and shy, Morocco clad from head to heel; Shakespearian quartos; Comedy As first she flashed from Richard Steele; And quaint De Foe on Mrs. Veal; And, lord of landing net and line, Old Izaak with his fishing creel,— The books that never can be mine! Incunables! for you I sigh, Black letter, at thy founts I kneel; Old tales of Perrault's nursery, For you I'd go without a meal! For books wherein did Aldus deal And rare Galliot du Pré I pine. The watches of the night reveal The books that never can be mine! Envoy Prince, hear a hopeless bard's appeal; Reverse the rules of Mine and Thine; Make it legitimate to steal The books that never can be mine! Ballade of the Bookworm Far in the past I peer, and see A child upon the nursery floor, A child with books upon his knee, Who asks, like Oliver, for more! The number of his years is IV, And yet in letters hath he skill, How deep he dives in fairy-lore! The books I loved, I love them still! One gift the fairies gave me: (three They commonly bestowed of yore) The love of books, the golden key That opens the enchanted door; Behind it BLUEBEARD lurks, and o'er And o'er doth JACK his Giants kill, And there is all ALADDIN's store,— The books I loved, I love them still! Take all, but leave my books to me! These heavy creels of old we bore We fill not now, nor wander free, Nor wear the heart that once we wore; Not now each river seems to pour His waters from the Muses' hill; Though something's gone from stream and shore, The books I loved, I love them still! Envoy Fate, that art queen by shore and sea, We bow submissive to thy will, Ah, grant, by some benign decree, The books I loved—to love them still. Old Friends Books, old friends that are always new, Of all good things that we know, are best; They never forsake us as others do, And never disturb our inward rest. Here is the truth in a world of lies, And all that in man is great or wise. Better than men or women, friend, That are dust, though dear in our joy and pain, Are the books their cunning hands have penned, For they depart, but the books remain; Through these they speak to us what is best, In the loving heart and the noble mind; All their royal souls possessed Belongs for ever to all mankind. When others fail him, the wise man looks To the sure companionship of books. VI HIS FRIENDS OLD AND YOUNG Clevedon Church In Memoriam H. B. Westward I watch the low green hills of Wales, The low sky silver gray, The turbid Channel with the wandering sails Moans through the winter day. There is no colour but one ashen light On tower and lonely tree, The little church upon the windy height Is gray as sky or sea. But there hath he that woke the sleepless love Slept through these fifty years, There is the grave that has been wept above With more than mortal tears. And far below I hear the Channel sweep And all his waves complain, As Hallam's dirge through all the years must keep Its monotone of pain. Gray sky—brown waters—as a bird that flies, My heart flits forth from these Back to the winter rose of northern skies, Back to the northern seas. And lo, the long waves of the ocean beat Below the minster gray, Caverns and chapels worn of saintly feet, And knees of them that pray. And I remember me how twain were one Beside that ocean dim, I count the years passed over since the sun That lights me looked on him, And dreaming of the voice that, save in sleep, Shall greet me not again, Far, far below I hear the Channel sweep And all his waves complain. To E. M. S. ‘Prima dicta mihi, summa dicenda Camena.’ The years will pass, and hearts will range, You conquer time, and care, and change. Though time doth still delight to shed The dust on many a younger head; Though care, oft coming, hath the guile From younger lips to steal the smile; Though change makes younger hearts wax cold, And sells new loves for loves of old, Time, change, nor care, hath learned the art To fleck your hair, to chill your heart, To touch your tresses with the snow, To mar your mirth of long ago. Change, care, nor time, while life endure, Shall spoil our ancient friendship sure, The love which flows from sacred springs, In ‘old unhappy far-off things’, From sympathies in grief and joy, Through all the years of man and boy. Therefore, to you, the rhymes I strung When even this ‘brindled’ head was young I bring, and later rhymes I bring That flit upon as weak a wing But still for you—for yours—they sing!— Tusitala R. L. S. We spoke of a rest in a fairy knowe of the north, but he, Far from the firths of the east, and the racing tides of the west, Sleeps in the sight and the sound of the infinite southern sea, Weary and well content in his grave on the Vaëa crest. Tusitala, the lover of children, the teller of tales, Giver of counsel and dreams, a wonder, a world's delight, Looks o'er the labours of men in the plain and the hill; and the sails Pass and repass on the sea that he loved, in the day and the night. Winds of the west and the east in the rainy season blow Heavy with perfume, and all his fragrant woods are wet, Winds of the east and west as they wander to and fro, Bear him the love of the land he loved, and the long regret. Once we were kindest, he said, when leagues of the limitless sea Flowed between us, but now that no wash of the wandering tides Sunders us each from each, yet nearer we seem to be, Whom only the unbridged stream of the river of death divides. To Robert Louis Stevenson WITH KIRK'S ‘SECRET COMMONWEALTH’ Olouis! you that like them maist, Ye're far frae kelpie, wraith, and ghaist, And fairy dames, no unco chaste, And haunted cell. Among a heathen clan ye're placed, That kens na hell! Ye hae nae heather, peat, nor birks, Nae trout in a' yer burnies lurks, There are nae bonny U.P. kirks, An awfu' place! Nane kens the Covenant o' Works Frae that o' Grace! But whiles, maybe, to them ye'll read Blads o' the Covenanting creed, And whiles their pagan wames ye'll feed On halesome parritch; And syne ye'll gar them learn a screed O' the Shorter Carritch. Yet thae uncovenanted shavers Hae rowth, ye say, o' clash and clavers O' gods and etins—auld wives' havers, But their delight; The voice o' him that tells them quavers Just wi' fair fright. And ye might tell, ayont the faem, Thae Hieland clashes o' our hame To speak the truth, I tak na shame To half believe them; And, stamped wi' Tusitala's name, They'll a' receive them. And folk to come ayont the sea May hear the yowl o' the Banshie, And frae the water-kelpie flee, Ere a' things cease, And island bairns may stolen be By the folk o' peace. Once Again To L. I linger round the very spot Where once we heeled the ball, And wonder if you've quite forgot Our sessions at the Hall; How gallantly we missed the globe, How gaily skelped the green, And wore the regulation robe And ran the Magazine. Forever yet my thoughts incline To catches in the slips, Which might have been, but were not, mine; My frozen finger-tips Let chances go like water through, And batsmen ran for three, And, if you were the bowler, you Would pitch the stumps at me! Ballade Dedicatory To Mrs. Charles Elton, of Whitestaunton The painted Briton built his mound, And left his celts and clay, On yon fair slope of sunlit ground That fronts your garden gay; The Roman came, he bore the sway, He bullied, bought, and sold— Your fountain sweeps his works away Beside your manor old! But still his crumbling urns are found Within the window-bay, Where once he listened to the sound That lulls you day by day;— The sound of summer winds at play, The noise of waters cold To Yarty wandering on their way, Beside your manor old! The Roman fell: his firm-set bound Became the Saxon's stay; The bells made music all around For monks in cloisters gray; Till fled the monks in disarray From their warm chantry's fold; Old Abbots slumber as they may, Beside your manor old! Envoy Creeds, empires, peoples, all decay, Down into darkness, rolled; May life that's fleet be sweet, I pray, Beside your manor old. E. C. S. ‘Ban and Arrière Ban!’ a host Broken, beaten, all unled, They return as doth a ghost From the dead. Sad or glad, my rallied rhymes, Sought our dusty papers through, For the sake of other times Come to you. Times and places new we know, Faces fresh and seasons strange; But the friends of long ago Do not change. L'Envoi To E. W. G. (Who also had rhymed on the Fortunate Islands of Lucian). Each in the self-same field we glean The field of the Samosatene; Each something takes and something leaves, And this must choose, and that forgo In Lucian's visionary sheaves, To twine a modern posy so; But all my gleanings, truth to tell, Are mixed with mournful asphodel, While yours are wreathed with poppies red, With flowers that Helen's feet have kissed, With leaves of vine that garlanded The Syrian Pantagruelist, The sage who laughed the world away, Who mocked at gods, and men, and care, More sweet of voice than Rabelais, And lighter-hearted than Voltaire. Desiderium In Memoriam S. F. A. The call of homing rooks, the shrill Song of some bird that watches late, The cries of children break the still Sad twilight by the churchyard gate. And o'er your far-off tomb the gray Sad twilight broods, and from the trees The rooks call on their homeward way, And are you heedless quite of these? The clustered rowan berries red And autumn's may, the clematis, They droop above your dreaming head; And these, and all things must you miss? Ah, you that loved the twilight air, The dim lit hour of quiet best, At last, at last you have your share Of what life gave so seldom, rest! Yes, rest beyond all dreaming deep, Or labour, nearer the Divine, And pure from fret, and smooth as sleep, And gentle as thy soul, is thine! So let it be! But could I know That thou in this soft autumn eve, This hush of earth that pleased thee so, Hadst pleasure still, I might not grieve. In Augustinum Dobson Iam Rude Donatum Dear poet, now turned out to grass (Like him who reigned in Babylon), Forget the seasons overlaid By business and the Board of Trade: And sing of old-world lad and lass As in the summers that are gone. Back to the golden prime of Anne! When you ambassador had been, And brought o'er sea the King again, Beatrix Esmond in his train. Ah, happy bard to hold her fan, And happy land with such a queen! We live too early, or too late, You should have shared the pint of Pope, And taught, well pleased, the shining shell To murmur of the fair Lepel, And changed the stars of St. John's fate To some more happy horoscope. By duchesses with roses crowned, And fed with chicken and champagne, Urbane and witty, and too wary To risk the feud of Lady Mary, You should have walked the courtly ground Of times that cannot come again. Bring back these years in verse or prose, (I very much prefer your verse!) As on some Twenty-Ninth of May Restore the splendour and the sway, Forget the sins, the wars, the woes— The joys alone must you rehearse. Forget the dunces (there is none So stupid as to snarl at you); So may your years with pen and book Run pleasant as an English brook Through meadows floral in the sun, And shadows fragrant of the dew. And thus at ending of your span— As all must end—the world shall say, ‘His best he gave: he left us not A line that saints could wish to blot, For he was blameless, though a man; And though the poet, he was gay!’ Ballade of Summer To C. H. A. When strawberry pottles are common and cheap, Ere elms be black, or limes be sere, When midnight dances are murdering sleep, Then comes in the sweet o' the year! And far from Fleet Street, far from here, The summer is queen in the length of the land, And moonlit nights they are soft and clear, When fans for a penny are sold in the Strand! When clamour that doves in the linden keep Mingles with musical plash of the weir, Where drowned green tresses of crowsfoot creep, Then comes in the sweet o' the year! And better a crust and a beaker of beer, With rose-hung hedges on either hand, Than a palace in town and a prince's cheer, When fans for a penny are sold in the Strand! When big trout late in the twilight leap, When cuckoo clamoureth far and near, When glittering scythes in the hayfield reap, Then comes in the sweet o' the year! And it's oh to sail, with the wind to steer, Where kine knee deep in the water stand, On a Highland loch, on a Lowland mere, When fans for a penny are sold in the Strand! Envoy Friend, with the fops while we dawdle here, Then comes in the sweet o' the year! And the summer runs out, like grains of sand, When fans for a penny are sold in the Strand! Ode to Mr. Saintsbury Come, all ye maidens and young men, Who thump the lute and smack the lyre; Thy sweetness bring, Le Gallienne, Watson, thy wing of eager fire! Impassioned Benson, softly sing, ‘Not yet the Muse's race is run,’ Touch, Thompson, touch the sounding string, With Johnson, Dobson, Davidson! Austin and Morris, fill the fife, Or sound the clarion, as of yore, Sing, Arnold, of this mortal life, Which Sakya Muni deemed a bore! Build, Rhymers' Club, the lofty rhyme, Great fancies mate with glowing words; Like Pembroke—in the Doctor's time— The land's ‘a nest of singing birds’. Let Tabb renew his modest vein, Nor let the voice of Tabley fail. With Blowsabella, once again, Delight us, Muse of Mr. Gale! I, too, to please my Saintsbury, The barrel organ will essay, Once more my penny whistle ply, Be archly sad, or glumly gay. Lo, at that threat the man succumbs, Before my voice the critic flies, The populace turn down their thumbs, He pales, he reels, he sinks, he dies! To Louisa Viscountess Wolseley Madame, it is no modish thing, The bookman's tribute that I bring; A talk of antiquaries gray, Dust unto dust this many a day, Gossip of texts and bindings old, Of faded type, and tarnish'd gold! Can ladies care for this to-do With Payne, Derome, and Padeloup? Can they resign the rout, the ball, For lonely joys of shelf and stall? The critic thus serenely wise; But you can read with other eyes, Whose books and bindings treasured are 'Midst mingled spoils of peace and war; Shields from the fights the Mahdi lost, And trinkets from the Golden Coast, And many a thing divinely done By Chippendale and Sheraton, And trophies of Egyptian deeds, And fans, and plates, and aggrey beads, Pomander boxes, assegais, And sword-hilts worn in Marlbro's days. In this abode of old and new, Of war and peace, my essays, too, For long in serials tempest-tost, Are landed now, and are not lost: Nay, on your shelf secure they lie, As in the amber sleeps the fly. 'Tis true, they are not ‘rich nor rare’; Enough, for me, that they are—there! Introductory Verses TO Songs and Rhymes: English and French by Walter Herries Pollock: London, 1882. Orhymer! skilled on either string, In either tongue, to strike and sing, Why ask of me an idle thing, A rhyme before your Rhymes to set? For good wine needs no bush; nor these Demand my praise to make them please. More than the gray anemones From fragrant April gardens wet Your singing verse delights my dream; But, bid me scribble, and I seem The huckster hoarse that o'er the stream Of traffic howls, Fresh flowers to-day! The crowd must praise the flowers, must come To buy them, but they wish him dumb, The man who cracks your tympanum With shouting what he need not say. The crowd in London's dust and grime Must crave the buds of summer time, But he who shouts, and I who rhyme, Might almost scare the crowd away! Nay, if that merchant only knew His art, he'd let the scented dew, The country fragrance wafted through The street, bring custom to his stall: And I, more wise than he, will let The blossoms in your garden set, Pansy, and rue, and violet, Speak for themselves to one and all. For Mark Twain's Jubilee To brave Mark Twain, across the sea, The years have brought his jubilee; One hears it half with pain, That fifty years have passed and gone Since danced the merry star that shone Above the babe, Mark Twain! How many and many a weary day, When sad enough were we, ‘Mark's way’ (Unlike the Laureate's Mark's) Has made us laugh until we cried, And sinking back exhausted, sighed, Like Gargery, Wot larx! We turn his pages, and we see The Mississippi flowing free; We turn again and grin O'er all Tom Sawyer did and planned, With him of the Ensanguined Hand, With Huckleberry Finn! Spirit of mirth, whose chime of bells Shakes on his cap, and sweetly swells Across the Atlantic main, Grant that Mark's laughter never die, That men, through many a century, May chuckle o'er Mark Twain! She To H. R. H. Not in the waste beyond the swamps and sand, The fever-haunted forest and lagoon, Mysterious Kôr thy walls forsaken stand, Thy lonely towers beneath the lonely moon, Not there doth Ayesha linger, rune by rune Spelling strange scriptures of a people banned, The world is disenchanted; over soon Shall Europe send her spies through all the land. Nay, not in Kôr, but in whatever spot, In town or field, or by the insatiate sea, Men brood on buried loves, and unforgot, Or break themselves on some divine decree, Or would o'erleap the limits of their lot, There, in the tombs and deathless, dwelleth she! To R. L. S. Written in retaliation for a poem in Underwoods beginning ‘Dear Andrew with the brindled hair’. (See Underwoods) Dear Louis of the awful cheek! Who told you it was right to speak, Where all the world might hear and stare, Of other fellows' ‘brindled hair’? ‘Shadows we are’, the Sophist knew— Shadows—‘and shadows we pursue.’ For this my ghost shall chase your shadow From Skerryvore to Colorado. With a Fairy Book To E. A. C. Too late they come—too late for you, These old friends that are ever new, Enchanted in our volume blue; For you ere now have wandered o'er A world of tales untold of yore, And learned the later fairy-lore! Nay, as within her briery brake The Sleeping Beauty did awake, Old tales may rouse them for your sake, And you once more may voyage through The forests that of old we knew, The fairy forests deep in dew; Where you, resuming childish things, Shall listen when the Blue Bird sings, And sit at feast with fairy kings, And taste their wine, ere all be done, And face more welcome shall be none Among the guests of Oberon. Ay, of that feast shall tales be told, The marvels of that world of gold, To children young, when you are old. When you are old! Ah, dateless ‘when’, For youth shall perish among men, And Spring herself be ancient then! To D. R. T. Dear Dorothea, I and you Both write, I'm told, of dwarfs and fays, And if, O maid with eyes so blue, They come—as probably they do— And teach you all about their ways, I wish you'd give them my address, Or bid them at the Club look in, And tell their secrets, and confess Where lay the fairy palaces. My utmost gratitude you'll win, And I, till tolls my parting knell, Will be your faithful slave A. L. To Master Frederick Longman Herlies, 1914. [Animal Story Book.] This year our book for Christmas varies, Deals not with history nor fairies, (I can't help thinking, children, you Prefer a book which is not true) We leave these intellectual feasts, To talk of fishes, birds, and beasts. These—though his aim is scarcely steady— These are, I think, a theme for Freddy! Trout, though he is not up to fly, He soon will catch—as well as I! So Freddy, take this artless rhyme And be a sportsman in your time! To Francis McCunn Loos, 1915 [Dedication in Blue True Story Book.] You like the things I used to like, The things I'm fond of still, The sound of fairy wands that strike Men into beasts at will. The cruel step-mother, the fair Step-daughter, kind and leal, The bull and bear so debonair, The trenchant fairy steel. You love the world where brute and fish Converse with man and bird, Where dungeons open at a wish, And seas dry at a word. That merry world to-day we leave, We list an o'er-true tale Of hearts that sore for Charlie grieve, When handsome princes fail; Of gallant races overthrown, Of dungeons ill to climb, There's no such tale of trouble known In all the fairy time. There, Montezuma still were king; There, Charles would wear the crown; And there the Highlanders would ding The Hanoverian down. In Fairyland the Rightful Cause Is never long a-winning, In Fairyland the fairy laws Are prompt to punish sinning: For Fairyland's the land of joy, And this the world of pain; So back to Fairyland, my boy, We'll journey once again. To Joan, Toddles, and Tiny: otherwise Meg and Maisie [Yellow Fairy Book.] Books Yellow, Red, and Green and Blue, All true, or just as good as true, And here's the Yellow Book for you! Hard is the path from A to Z, And puzzling to a curly head, Yet leads to books—Green, Blue and Red. For every child should understand That letters from the first were planned To guide us into Fairy Land. So labour at your alphabet For by that learning shall you get To lands where fairies may be met. And going where this pathway goes You too, at last, may find—who knows? The garden of the Singing Rose. To Miss Sybil Corbet Author of Animal Land, Sybil's Garden of Pleasant Beasts, and Epiotic Pcems. [Red Book of Animal Stories.] Sybil, the Beasts we bring to you Are not so friendly, not so odd, As those that all amazed we view, The brutes created by your nod— The Wuss, the Azorkon, and the Pod; But then, our tales are true! Fauna of fancy, one and all Obey your happy voice, we know; A garden zoological Is all around where'er you go; Mellys and Kanks walk to and fro, And Didds attend your call. We have but common wolves and bears, Lion and leopard, hawk and hind, Tigers and crocodiles and hares: But yet they hope you will be kind, And mark with sympathetic mind These moving tales of theirs. VII BALLADES At the Sign of the Ship Ballade Introductory What men collect, what men debate, What Bain has bought, or Christie sold, Whatever serves to illustrate The fashions of the days of old; How Cambridge pulled, how Oxford bowled, Wild lore of races white or black; Of these shall many a tale be told In this our Stall of Bric-a-brac! Strange wrecks from rarest books that fate Hath hardly saved from moth and mould; Quaint traits of manner, old or late, Of cloth of frieze, and cloth of gold, Faint echoes that the ages cold To our warm age send ringing back, We gather all, we all enfold In this our Stall of Bric-a-brac. Tales of the Church, and of the State, Of how men prayed—and how they polled— We tell; and talk of flies, and bait, And ancient missals golden-scrolled; And here, perchance, shall songs be trolled— Of holidays, when work is slack— We shall do everything—but scold In this our Stall of Bric-a-brac. Envoy Then come, ye merry buyers bold, What is't ye seek? what is't ye lack? We've many wares, and manifold, In this our Stall of Bric-à-brac! Ballade of Literary Fame ‘All these for fourpence.’ Oh, where are the endless romances Our grandmothers used to adore? The knights with their helms and their lances, Their shields and the favours they wore? And the monks with their magical lore? They have passed to oblivion and nox, They have fled to the shadowy shore,— They are all in the Fourpenny Box! And where the poetical fancies Our fathers rejoiced in, of yore? The lyric's melodious expanses, The epics in cantos a score They have been and are not: no more Shall the shepherds drive silvery flocks, Nor the ladies their languors deplore— They are all in the Fourpenny Box! And the music? The songs and the dances? The tunes that time may not restore? And the tomes where divinity prances? And the pamphlets where heretics roar? They have ceased to be even a bore— The divine, and the sceptic who mocks— They are ‘cropped’, they are ‘foxed’ to the core— They are all in the Fourpenny Box! Envoy Suns beat on them; tempests downpour, On the chest without cover or locks, Where they lie by the bookseller's door— They are all in the Fourpenny Box! Ballade of the Primitive Jest ‘What did the dark-haired Iberian laugh at before the tall blonde Aryan drove him into the corners of Europe?’—Brander Matthews. I am an ancient Jest! Palaeolithic man In his arboreal nest The sparks of fun would fan; My outline did he plan, And laughed like one possessed, 'Twas thus my course began, I am a Merry Jest! I am an early Jest! Man delved, and built, and span; Then wandered south and west The peoples Aryan, I journeyed in their van; The Semites, too, confessed,— From Beersheba to Dan,— I am a Merry Jest! I am an ancient Jest, Through all the human clan, Red, black, white, free, oppressed, Hilarious I ran! I'm found in Lucian, In Poggio, and the rest, I'm dear to Moll and Nan! I am a Merry Jest! Envoy Prince, you may storm and ban— Joe Millers are a pest, Suppress me if you can! I am a Merry Jest! Ballade of Sleep The hours are passing slow, I hear their weary tread Clang from the tower, and go Back to their kinsfolk dead. Sleep! death's twin brother dread! Why dost thou scorn me so? The wind's voice overhead Long wakeful here I know, And music from the steep Where waters fall and flow. Wilt thou not hear me, Sleep? All sounds that might bestow Rest on the fever'd bed, All slumb'rous sounds and low Are mingled here and wed, And bring no drowsihed. Shy dreams flit to and fro With shadowy hair dispread; With wistful eyes that glow, And silent robes that sweep. Thou wilt not hear me; no? Wilt thou not hear me, Sleep? What cause hast thou to show Of sacrifice unsped? Of all thy slaves below I most have labour(e`)d With service sung and said; Have cull'd such buds as blow, Soft poppies white and red, Where thy still gardens grow, And Lethe's waters weep. Why, then, art thou my foe? Wilt thou not hear me, Sleep? Envoy Prince, ere the dark be shred By golden shafts, ere low And long the shadows creep: Lord of the wand of lead, Soft-footed as the snow, Wilt thou not hear me, Sleep? Ballade of the Girton Girl She has just ‘put her gown on’ at Girton, She is learned in Latin and Greek, But lawn tennis she plays with a skirt on That the prudish remark with a shriek. In her accents, perhaps, she is weak (Ladies are, one observes with a sigh), And in Algebra—there she's unique, But her forte's to evaluate ?. She can talk about putting a ‘spirt on’ (I admit, an unmaidenly freak), And she dearly delighteth to flirt on A punt in some shadowy creek. Should her bark, by mischance, spring a leak, She can swim as a swallow can fly; She can fence, she can putt with a cleek, But her forte's to evaluate ?. She has lectured on Scopas and Myrton, Coins, vases, mosaics, the antique, Old tiles with the secular dirt on, Old marbles with noses to seek. And her Cobet she quotes by the week, And she's written on ??? and on ???, And her service is swift and oblique, But her forte's to evaluate ?. Envoy Princess, like a rose is her cheek, And her eyes are as blue as the sky, And I'd speak, had I courage to speak, But—her forte's to evaluate ?. Ballade of the Penitents ‘Le repentir de leur premier choix les rend des Penitens du Diable, comme dit Tertullien.’—Pascal, Pensées, 1672, p. 178. ‘Oh, who be ye thus doubtful led And listless through the glad array With languid look, with drooping head, In all this rout of ladies gay? Ye walk with them, but not as they, Ye tarry sadly in their tents, Why fare ye thus half-hearted, say?’— ‘We are St. Satan's Penitents! ‘A straiter path we once would tread, Through wilds that knew not of the may; The loads that weighed on us like lead We bore through thorns and sloughs of clay. No time had we to pause or play With music of glad instruments, But still we clambered: Well-a-day! We are St. Satan's Penitents! “The path is over steep,” we said, “The rueful skies are ashen gray, And over harshly are we sped, Still upwards! Ne'er a stop nor stay.” We cast our burdens all away, We fled adown the steep ascents, We were aweary of that way; We are St. Satan's Penitents.' Envoy Fair is the path and bright the day, Where now we whisper our laments; With backward glance we go astray, We are St. Satan's Penitents. Ballade to Theocritus, in Winter ?????? ??? ??????? ?? ??? Id. viii. 56. Ah! leave the smoke, the wealth, the roar Of London, and the bustling street, For still, by the Sicilian shore, The murmur of the Muse is sweet. Still, still, the suns of summer greet The mountain-grave of Helikê, And shepherds still their songs repeat Where breaks the blue Sicilian sea. What though they worship Pan no more That guarded once the shepherd's seat, They chatter of their rustic lore, They watch the wind among the wheat: Cicalas chirp, the young lambs bleat, Where whispers pine to cypress tree; They count the waves that idly beat Where breaks the blue Sicilian sea. Theocritus! thou canst restore The pleasant years, and over-fleet; With thee we live as men of yore, We rest where running waters meet: And then we turn unwilling feet And seek the world—so must it be— We may not linger in the heat Where breaks the blue Sicilian sea! Envoy Master—when rain, and snow, and sleet And northern winds are wild, to thee We come, we rest in thy retreat, Where breaks the blue Sicilian sea! Ballade of Difficult Rhymes With certain rhymes 'tis hard to deal; For ‘silver’ we have ne'er a rhyme. On ‘orange’ (as on orange peel) The bard has slipped full many a time. With ‘babe’ there's scarce a sound will chime, Though ‘astrolabe’ fits like a glove; But, ye that on Parnassus climb, Why, why are rhymes so rare to love? A rhyme to ‘cusp’, to beg or steal, I've sought from evensong to prime; But vain is my poetic zeal, There's not one sound is worth a ‘dime’: ‘Bilge,’ ‘coif,’ ‘scarf,’ ‘window’—deeds of crime I'd do to gain the rhymes thereof; Nor shrink from acts of moral grime— Why, why are rhymes so rare to love? To ‘dove’ my fancies flit, and wheel Like butterflies on banks of thyme. ‘Above’?—or ‘shove’?—alas! I feel, They're too much used to be sublime. I scorn with angry pantomime, The thought of ‘move’ (pronounced as muv) Ah, in Apollo's golden clime Why, why are rhymes so rare to love? Envoy Prince of the lute and lyre, reveal New rhymes, fresh-minted, from above, Nor still be deaf to our appeal, Why, why are rhymes so rare to love? Ballade of Blue China There's a joy without canker or cark, There's a pleasure eternally new, 'Tis to gloat on the glaze and the mark Of china that's ancient and blue; Unchipp'd all the centuries through It has pass'd, since the chime of it rang, And they fashion'd it, figure and hue, In the reign of the Emperor Hwang. These dragons (their tails, you remark, Into bunches of gillyflowers grew); When Noah came out of the ark, Did these lie in wait for his crew? They snorted, they snapp'd, and they slew, They were mighty of fin and of fang, And their portraits Celestials drew In the reign of the Emperor Hwang. Here's a pot with a cot in a park, In a park where the peach-blossoms blew; Where the lovers eloped in the dark, Lived, died, and were changed into two Bright birds that eternally flew Through the boughs of the may, as they sang; 'Tis a tale was undoubtedly true In the reign of the Emperor Hwang. Envoy Come, snarl at my ecstasies, do! Kind critic, your ‘tongue has a tang’; But—a sage never heeded a shrew In the reign of the Emperor Hwang. Ballade of Middle Age Our youth began with tears and sighs, With seeking what we could not find; Our verses all were threnodies, In elegiacs still we whined; Our ears were deaf, our eyes were blind, We sought and knew not what we sought. We marvel, now we look behind: Life's more amusing than we thought! Oh, foolish youth, untimely wise! Oh, phantoms of the sickly mind! What? not content with seas and skies, With rainy clouds and southern wind, With common cares and faces kind, With pains and joys each morning brought? Ah, old, and worn, and tired we find Life's more amusing than we thought! Though youth ‘turns spectre-thin and dies’, To mourn for youth we're not inclined; We set our souls on salmon flies, We whistle where we once repined. Confound the woes of human-kind! By Heaven we're well deceived, I wot; Who hum, contented or resigned, ‘Life's more amusing than we thought’! Envoy O nate mecum, worn and lined Our faces show, but that is naught; Our hearts are young 'neath wrinkled rind: Life's more amusing than we thought! Ballade of the Voyage to Cythera After Théodore De Banville I know Cythera long is desolate; I know the winds have stripp'd the gardens green. Alas, my friends! beneath the fierce sun's weight A barren reef lies where love's flowers have been, Nor ever lover on that coast is seen! So be it, but we seek a fabled shore, To lull our vague desires with mystic lore, To wander where love's labyrinths beguile; There let us land, there dream for evermore: ‘It may be we shall touch the happy isle.’ The sea may be our sepulchre. If fate, If tempests wreak their wrath on us, serene We watch the bolt of heaven, and scorn the hate Of angry gods that smite us in their spleen. Perchance the jealous mists are but the screen That veils the fairy coast we would explore. Come, though the sea be vex'd, and breakers roar; Come, for the air of this old world is vile, Haste we, and toil, and faint not at the oar; ‘It may be we shall touch the happy isle.’ Gray serpents trail in temples desecrate Where Cypris smiled—the golden maid—the queen— And ruined is the palace of our state; But happy loves flit round the mast, and keen The shrill wind sings the silken cords between. Heroes are we, with wearied hearts and sore, Whose flower is faded and whose locks are hoar; Yet haste, light skiffs, where myrtle thickets smile; Love's panthers sleep 'mid roses, as of yore: ‘It may be we shall touch the happy isle!’ Envoy Sad eyes, the blue sea laughs, as heretofore; Ah, singing birds, your happy music pour! Ah, poets, leave the sordid earth awhile; Fill to these ancient gods we still adore; ‘It may be, we shall touch the happy isle!’ Ballade of Aucassin Where smooth the southern waters run Through rustling leagues of poplars gray, Beneath a veiled soft southern sun, We wandered out of yesterday— Went maying in that ancient May Whose fallen flowers are fragrant yet, And loitered by the fountain spray With Aucassin and Nicolete. The grass-grown paths are trod of none Where through the woods they went astray; The spider's traceries are spun Across the darkling forest way; There come no knights that ride to slay, No pilgrims through the grasses wet, No shepherd lads that sang their say With Aucassin and Nicolete! 'Twas here by Nicolete begun Her lodge of boughs and grasses gay; 'Scaped from the cell of marble dun 'Twas here the lover found the fay, O, lovers fond! O, foolish play! How hard we find it to forget Who fain would dwell with them as they, With Aucassin and Nicolete. Envoy Prince, 'tis a melancholy lay! For youth, for life we both regret! How fair they seem how far away; With Aucassin and Nicolete! Ballade of a Friar (Clement Marot's Frère Lubin, though translated by Longfellow and others, has not hitherto been rendered into the original measure of ballade à double refrain.) Some ten or twenty times a day To bustle to the town with speed, To dabble in what dirt he may— Le Frère Lubin's the man you need! But any sober life to lead Upon an exemplary plan, Requires a Christian indeed— Le Frère Lubin is not the man! Another's wealth on his to lay, With all the craft of guile and greed, To leave you bare of pence or pay— Le Frère Lubin's the man you need! But watch him with the closest heed, And dun him with what force you can— He'll not refund, howe'er you plead— Le Frère Lubin is not the man! An honest girl to lead astray, With subtle saw and promised meed, Requires no cunning crone and gray— Le Frère Lubin's the man you need! He preaches an ascetic creed, But—try him with the water can— A dog will drink, whate'er his breed— Le Frère Lubin is not the man! Envoy In good to fail, in ill succeed, Le Frère Lubin's the man you need! In honest works to lead the van, Le Frère Lubin is not the man! Ballade of Neglected Merit N.B.—There is only one veracious statement in this ballade, which must not be accepted as autobiographical. I have scribbled in verse and in prose, I have painted ‘arrangements in greens’, And my name is familiar to those Who take in the high-class magazines. I compose; I've invented machines; I have written an ‘Essay on rhyme’; For my county I played, in my teens, But—I am not in ‘Men of the Time!’ I have lived, as a chief, with the Crows; I have ‘interviewed’ princes and queens; I have climbed the Caucasian snows; I abstain, like the ancients, from beans— I've a guess what Pythagoras means When he says that to eat them's a crime— I have lectured upon the Essenes, But—I am not in ‘Men of the Time!’ I've a fancy as morbid as Poe's, I can tell what is meant by ‘shebeens’, I have breasted the river that flows Through the land of the wild Gadarenes; I can gossip with Burton on skenes, I can imitate Irving (the Mime), And my sketches are quainter than Keene's; But—I am not in ‘Men of the Time!’ Envoy So the tower of mine eminence leans Like the Pisan, and mud is its lime; I'm acquainted with dukes and with deans— But—I am not in ‘Men of the Time!’ Ballade of Autumn We built a castle in the air, In summer weather, you and I; The wind and sun were in your hair— Gold hair against a sapphire sky: When autumn came, with leaves that fly Before the storm, across the plain, You fled from me, with scarce a sigh— My love returns no more again! The windy lights of autumn flare: I watch the moonlit sails go by; I marvel how men toil and fare, The weary business that they ply! Their voyaging is vanity, And fairy gold is all their gain, And all the winds of winter cry, ‘My love returns no more again!’ Here, in my castle of despair, I sit alone with memory; The wind-fed wolf has left his lair, To keep the outcast company. The brooding owl he hoots hard by, The hare shall kindle on thy hearth-stane, The Rhymer's soothest prophecy— Thomas of Ercildoune. My love returns no more again! Envoy Lady, my home until I die Is here, where youth and hope were slain: They flit, the ghosts of our July, My love returns no more again! Ballade of True Wisdom While others are asking for beauty or fame, Or praying to know that for which they should pray, Or courting Queen Venus, that affable dame, Or chasing the Muses the weary and gray, The sage has found out a more excellent way— To Pan and to Pallas his incense he showers, And his humble petition puts up day by day, For a house full of books, and a garden of flowers. Inventors may bow to the god that is lame, And crave from the fire on his stithy a ray; Philosophers kneel to the god without name, Like the people of Athens, agnostics are they; The hunter a fawn to Diana will slay, The maiden wild roses will wreathe for the Hours; But the wise man will ask, ere libation he pay, For a house full of books, and a garden of flowers. Oh! grant me a life without pleasure or blame! (As mortals count pleasure who rush through their day With a speed to which that of the tempest is tame)! Oh, grant me a house by the beach of a bay, Where the waves can be surly in winter, and play With the sea-weed in summer, ye bountiful powers! And I'd leave all the hurry, the noise, and the fray, For a house full of books, and a garden of flowers. Envoy Gods, give or withhold it; your ‘yea’ and your ‘nay’ Are immutable, heedless of outcry of ours: But life is worth living, and here we would stay For a house full of books, and a garden of flowers. Valentine in Form of Ballade The soft wind from the south land sped, He set his strength to blow, From forests where Adonis bled, And lily flowers a-row: He crossed the straits like streams that flow, The ocean dark as wine, To my true love to whisper low, To be your Valentine. The spring half-raised her drowsy head, Besprent with drifted snow, ‘I'll send an April day’, she said, ‘To lands of wintry woe’. He came—the winter's overthrow— With showers that sing and shine; Pied daisies round your path to strow, To be your Valentine. Where sands of Egypt, swart and red, 'Neath suns Egyptian glow, In places of the princely dead, By the Nile's overflow, The swallow preened her wings to go, And for the north did pine, And fain would brave the frost her foe, To be your Valentine. Envoy Spring, swallow, south wind, even so, Their various voice combine; But that they crave on me bestow— To be your Valentine. Ballade of Old Plays (I es Œuvres de Monsieur Molière. A Paris, chez Louys Billaine, à la Palme. M. D. C. LXVI.) La Cour When these old plays were new, the King, Beside the Cardinal's chair, Applauded, 'mid the courtly ring, The verses of Molière. Point-lace was then the only wear, Old Corneille came to woo, And bright Du Parc was young and fair, When these old plays were new! La Comédie How shrill the butcher's cat-calls ring, How loud the lackeys swear! Black pipe-bowls on the stage they fling, At Brécourt, fuming there! The porter's stabbed! a Mousquetaire Breaks in with noisy crew— 'Twas all a commonplace affair When these old plays were new! La Ville When these old plays were new! They bring A host of phantoms rare: Old jests that float, old jibes that sting, Old faces peaked with care: Ménage's smirk, de Visé's stare, The thefts of Jean Ribou— A knavish publisher. Ah, publishers were hard to bear When these old plays were new. Envoy Ghosts, at your poet's word ye dare To break death's dungeons through; And frisk, as in that golden air, When these old plays were new! Ballade of Life ‘“Dead and gone”,—a sorry burden of the Ballad of Life.’ Death's Jest Book. Say, fair maids, maying In gardens green, In deep dells straying, What end hath been Two Mays between Of the flowers that shone And your own sweet queen— ‘They are dead and gone!’ Say, grave priests, praying In dule and teen, From cells decaying— What have ye seen Of the proud and mean? Of Judas and John, Of the foul and clean?— ‘They are dead and gone!’ Say, kings, arraying Loud wars to win— Of your manslaying What gain ye glean? ‘They are fierce and keen, But they fall anon, On the swords that lean— They are dead and gone!’ Envoy Through the mad world's scene, We are drifting on, To this tune, I ween, ‘They are dead and gone!’ Ballade of the Southern Cross Fair islands of the silver fleece, Hoards of unsunned, uncounted gold, Whose havens are the haunts of peace, Whose boys are in our quarrel bold; Our bolt is shot, our tale is told, Our ship of state in storms may toss; But ye are young, if we are old, Ye Islands of the Southern Cross! Ah, we must dwindle and decrease, Such fates the ruthless years unfold; And yet we shall not wholly cease, We shall not perish unconsoled; Nay, still shall freedom keep her hold Within the sea's inviolate fosse, And boast her sons of English mould, Ye Islands of the Southern Cross! All empires tumble—Rome and Greece— Their swords are rust, their altars cold! For us, the children of the seas, Who ruled where'er the waves have rolled, For us, in fortune's books enscrolled, I read no runes of hopeless loss; Nor—while ye last—our knell is tolled, Ye Islands of the Southern Cross! Envoy Britannia, when thy hearth's a-cold, When o'er thy grave has grown the moss, Still Rule Australia shall be trolled In Islands of the Southern Cross! Double Ballade of Primitive Man To J. A. F. He lived in a cave by the seas, He lived upon oysters and foes, And his list of forbidden degrees, An extensive morality shows; Geological evidence goes To prove he had never a pan, But he shaved with a shell when he chose— 'Twas the manner of Primitive Man. He worshipp'd the rain and the breeze, He worshipp'd the river that flows, And the dawn, and the moon, and the trees, And bogies, and serpents, and crows; He buried his dead with their toes Tucked-up, an original plan, Till their knees came right under their nose— 'Twas the manner of Primitive Man. His communal wives, at his ease, He would curb with occasional blows; Or his state had a queen, like the bees; (As another philosopher trows): When he spoke, it was never in prose, But he sang in a strain that would scan, For (to doubt it, perchance, were morose) 'Twas the manner of Primitive Man! On the coasts that incessantly freeze, With his stones, and his bones, and his bows; On luxuriant tropical leas, Where the summer eternally glows, He is found, and his habits disclose (Let theology say what she can) That he lived in the long, long agos, 'Twas the manner of Primitive Man! From a status like that of the Crees, Our society's fabric arose— Develop'd, evolved, if you please, But deluded chronologists chose, In a fancied accordance with Mos es, 4000 B.C. for the span When he rushed on the world and its woes— 'Twas the manner of Primitive Man! But the mild anthropologist—he's Not recent inclined to suppose Flints palæolithic like these, Quaternary bones such as those! In rhinoceros, mammoth and co.'s, First epoch, the human began, Theologians all to expose— 'Tis the mission of Primitive Man. Envoy Max, proudly your Aryans pose, But their rigs they undoubtedly ran, For, as every Darwinian knows, 'Twas the manner of Primitive Man! The last three stanzas are by an eminent anthropologist. Ballade of the Dream Swift as sound of music fled When no more the organ sighs; Sped as all old days are sped, So your lips, love, and your eyes, So your gentle-voiced replies Mine one hour in sleep that seem, Rise and flit when slumber flies, Following darkness like a dream! Like the scent from roses red, Like the dawn from golden skies, Like the semblance of the dead From the living love that hies; Like the shifting shade that lies On the moonlight-silvered stream, So you rise when dreams arise, Following darkness like a dream! Could some spell, or sung or said, Could some kindly witch and wise, Lull for aye this dreaming head In a mist of memories, I would lie like him who lies Where the lights on Latmos gleam,— Wake not, find not Paradise Following darkness like a dream! Envoy Sleep, that giv'st what Life denies, Shadowy bounties and supreme, Bring the dearest face that flies Following darkness like a dream! Ballade of Queen Anne The modish Airs, The tansey brew, The Swains and Fairs In curtained pew; Nymphs Kneller drew, Books Bentley read,— Who knows them, who? Queen Anne is dead! We buy her chairs, Her china blue; Her red-brick squares We build anew; But ah! we rue, When all is said, The tale o'er-true, Queen Anne is dead! Now Bulls and Bears, A ruffling crew, With stocks and shares, With Turk and Jew, Go bubbling through The town ill-bred: The world's askew, Queen Anne is dead! Envoy Friend, praise the new; The old is fled: Vivat Frou-Frou! Queen Anne is dead! Ballade of the Real and Ideal Ovisions of salmon tremendous, Of trout of unusual weight, Of waters that wander as Ken does, Ye come through the Ivory Gate! But the skies that bring never a ‘spate’, But the flies that catch up in a thorn, But the creel that is barren of freight, Through the portals of horn! O dreams of the fates that attend us With prints in the earliest state! O bargains in books that they send us, Ye come through the Ivory Gate! But the tome that has never a mate, But the quarto that's tattered and torn, And bereft of a title and date, Through the portals of horn! O dreams of the tongues that commend us, Of crowns for the laureate pate, Of a public to buy and befriend us, Ye come through the Ivory Gate! But the critics that slash us and slate, ‘Slate’ is a professional term for a severe criticism. Clearly the word is originally ‘slat’, a narrow board of wood with which a person might be beaten. This was the note in earlier editions, but, in the Athenaeum, October 31, 1891, Mr. Skeat gives another derivation, and insists that from his verdict only dull and ignorant people can differ. ??) ??????? ???????????. But the people that hold us in scorn, But the sorrow, the scathe, and the hate, Through the portals of horn! Envoy Fair dreams of things golden and great, Ye come through the Ivory Gate; But the facts that are bleak and forlorn, Through the portals of horn! Ballade of Yule This life's most jolly, Amiens said, Heigh-ho, the holly! So sang he. As the good duke was comforted In forest exile, so may we! The years may darken as they flee, And Christmas bring his melancholy: But round the old mahogany tree We drink, we sing Heigh-ho, the holly! Though some are dead and some are fled To lands of summer over sea, The holly berry keeps his red, The merry children keep their glee; They hoard with artless secrecy This gift for Maude, and that for Molly, And Santa Claus he turns the key On Christmas Eve, Heigh-ho, the holly! Amid the snow the birds are fed, The snow lies deep on lawn and lea; The skies are shining overhead, The robin's tame that was so free. Far north, at home, the ‘barley bree’ They brew; they give the hour to folly, How ‘Rab and Allan came to pree’, They sing, we sing, Heigh-ho, the holly! Envoy Friend, let us pay the wonted fee, The yearly tithe of mirth: be jolly! It is a duty so to be, Though half we sigh, Heigh-ho, the holly! Ballade against the Jesuits After La Fontaine Rome does right well to censure all the vain Talk of Jansenius, and of them who preach That earthly joys are damnable! 'Tis plain We need not charge at Heaven as at a breach; No, amble on! We'll gain it, one and all; The narrow path's a dream fantastical, And Arnauld's quite superfluously driven Mirth from the world. We'll scale the heavenly wall; Escobar makes a primrose path to heaven! He does not hold a man may well be slain Who vexes with unseasonable speech, You may do murder for five ducats gain, Not for a pin, a ribbon, or a peach; He ventures (most consistently) to teach That there are certain cases that befall When perjury need no good man appal, And life of love (he says) may keep a leaven. Sure, hearing this, a grateful world will bawl, ‘Escobar makes a primrose path to heaven!’ ‘For God's sake read me somewhat in the strain Of his most cheering volumes, I beseech!’ Why should I name them all? a mighty train— So many, none may know the name of each. Make these your compass to the heavenly beach, These only in your library install: Burn Pascal and his fellows, great and small, Dolts that in vain with Escobar have striven; I tell you, and the common voice doth call, Escobar makes a primrose path to heaven! Envoy Satan, that pride did hurry to thy fall, Thou porter of the grim infernal hall— Thou keeper of the courts of souls unshriven! To shun thy shafts, to 'scape thy hellish thrall, Escobar makes a primrose path to heaven! Ballade of Dead Cities To E. W. G. The dust of Carthage and the dust Of Babel on the desert wold, The loves of Corinth, and the lust, Orchomenos increased with gold; The town of Jason, over-bold, And Cherson, smitten in her prime— What are they but a dream half-told? Where are the cities of old time? In towns that were a kingdom's trust, In dim Atlantic forests' fold, The marble wasteth to a crust, The granite crumbles into mould; O'er these—left nameless from of old— As over Shinar's brick and slime, One vast forgetfulness is roll'd— Where are the cities of old time? The lapse of ages, and the rust, The fire, the frost, the waters cold, Efface the evil and the just; From Thebes, that Eriphyle sold, To drown'd Caer-Is, whose sweet bells toll'd Beneath the wave a dreamy chime, That echo'd from the mountain-hold— ‘Where are the cities of old time?’ Envoy Prince, all thy towns and cities must Decay as these, till all their crime, And mirth, and wealth, and toil are thrust Where are the cities of old time. Ballade of the Wicked Earl (Lines written after a fortnight spent with Ouida's novels.) Had I been ‘in the purple born’ (As Ouida loves to say), I'd treat morality with scorn, And live uncommon gay: My bills, of course, I ne'er would pay, At creditors I'd sneer, What ‘hecatombs of doves’ I'd slay, Had I been born a peer! What wreathes of roses I'd have worn, All drenched with bright tokay! What maidens from their lovers torn Had rued their natal day! What wondrous odds you'd see me lay, What fences I would clear, And gold, like dross, I'd fling away, Had I been born a peer! And last, grown aged, stern, forlorn, My gold locks turned to gray; My crown of roses changed to thorn I'd end with some display! Through foeman's ranks I'd cleave my way, Through Zouave and Cuirassier, And die where fiercest raged the fray, Had I been born a peer. Envoy Ouida, the good old times decay, And even viscounts fear To play the kind of pranks we'd play Had I been born a peer, My dear, Had I been born a peer! Ballade for the Laureate Rhyme, in a late disdainful age, Hath many and many an eager knight; Each man of them, to print his page, From every quarter wings his flight! What tons of manuscripts alight Here in the Row, how many a while, For all can rhyme, when all can write— The Master's yonder, in the Isle! Like Otus some, with giant rage, But scarcely with a giant's might, Ossa on Pelion engage To pile, and scale Parnassus' height! And some, with subtle nets and slight, Entangle rhymes exceeding vile, And wondrous adjectives unite— The Master's yonder, in the Isle! Alas, the Muse they cannot cage, These poets in a sorry plight, Vain is the weary war they wage, In vain they curse the critic's spite! While grammar some neglect outright, While others polish with the file, Some fate contrives their toil to blight— The Master's yonder, in the Isle! Envoy Prince, Arnold's jewel-work is bright, And Browning, in his iron style, Doth gold on his rude anvil smite— The Master's yonder, in the Isle! Ballade of the Midnight Forest After Théodore De Banville Still sing the mocking fairies, as of old, Beneath the shade of thorn and holly-tree; The west wind breathes upon them, pure and cold, And wolves still dread Diana roaming free In secret woodland with her company. 'Tis though the peasants' hovels know her rite When now the wolds are bathed in silver light, And first the moonrise breaks the dusky gray, Then down the dells, with blown soft hair and bright, And through the dim wood Dian threads her way. With water-weeds twined in their locks of gold The strange cold forest-fairies dance in glee; Sylphs over-timorous and over-bold Haunt the dark hollows where the dwarf may be, The wild red dwarf, the nixies' enemy; Then 'mid their mirth, and laughter, and affright, The sudden goddess enters, tall and white, With one long sigh for summers pass'd away; The swift feet tear the ivy nets outright And through the dim wood Dian threads her way. She gleans her silvan trophies; down the wold She hears the sobbing of the stags that flee Mixed with the music of the hunting roll'd, But her delight is all in archery, And naught of ruth and pity wotteth she More than her hounds that follow on the flight; The goddess draws a golden bow of might And thick she rains the gentle shafts that slay. She tosses loose her locks upon the night, And through the dim wood Dian threads her way. Envoy Prince, let us leave the din, the dust, the spite, The gloom and glare of towns, the plague, the blight: Amid the forest leaves and fountain spray There is the mystic home of our delight, And through the dim wood Dian threads her way. Ballade of Cleopatra's Needle Ye giant shades of Ra and Tum, Ye ghosts of gods Egyptian, If murmurs of our planet come To exiles in the precincts wan Where, fetish or Olympian, To help or harm no more ye list; Look down, if look ye may, and scan This monument in London mist! Behold, the hieroglyphs are dumb That once were read of him that ran When seistron, cymbal, trump, and drum Wild music of the Bull began; When through the chanting priestly clan Walk'd Ramses, and the high sun kiss'd This stone, with blessing scored and ban— This monument in London mist. The stone endures though gods be numb; Though human effort, plot, and plan Be sifted, drifted, like the sum Of sands in wastes Arabian. What king may deem him more than man, What priest says faith can time resist While this endures to mark their span— This monument in London mist? Envoy Prince, the stone's shade on your divan Falls; it is longer than ye wist: It preaches, as time's gnomon can, This monument in London mist! Ballade of Æsthetic Adjectives There be ‘subtle’ and ‘sweet’, that are bad ones to beat, There are ‘lives unlovely’, and ‘souls astray’; There is much to be done yet with ‘moody’ and ‘meet’, And ‘ghastly’, and ‘grimly’, and ‘gaunt’, and ‘gray’; We should ever be ‘blithesome’, but never be ‘gay’, And ‘splendid’ is suited to ‘summer’ and ‘sea’; ‘Consummate’, they say, is enjoying its day— ‘Intense’ is the adjective dearest to me! The snows and the rose they are ‘windy’ and ‘fleet’, And ‘frantic’ and ‘faint’ are delight and dismay; Yea, ‘sanguine’, it seems, as the juice of the beet, Are ‘the hands of the king’ in a general way: There be loves that ‘quicken’, and ‘sicken’, and ‘slay’; ‘Supreme’ is the song of the bard of the free; But of adjectives all that I name in my lay ‘Intense’ is the adjective dearest to me! The matron intense—let us sit at her feet, And pelt her with lilies as long as we may; The maiden intense—is not always discreet: But the singer intense, in his ‘singing array’, Will win all the world with his roundelay: While ‘blithe’ birds carol from tree to tree, And art unto nature doth simper, and say— ‘“Intense” is the adjective dearest to me!’ Envoy Prince, it is surely as good as a play To mark how the poets and painters agree; But of plumage aesthetic that feathers the jay, ‘Intense’ is the adjective dearest to me! Ballade for a Baby (From The Garland of Rachel On the birth of Rachel, daughter of the Rev. C. H. O. Daniel, of Worcester College, his friends were asked each to write her a poem, which were all bound under the title of The Garland of Rachel.) 'Tis distance lends, the poet says, Enchantment to the view, And this makes possible the praise Which I bestow on you. For babies rosy-pink of hue I do not always care, But distance paints the mountains blue, And Rachel always fair. Ah, time! speed on her flying days, Bring back my youth that flew, That she may listen to my lays Where Merton stock-doves coo; That I may sing afresh, anew, My songs, now faint and rare, Time, make me always twenty-two, And Rachel always fair. Nay, long ago, down dusky ways Fled Cupid and his crew; Life brings not back the morning haze, The dawning and the dew; And other lips must sigh and sue, And younger lovers dare To hint that love is always true, And Rachel always fair. Envoy Princess, let Age bid Youth adieu, Adieu to this despair, To me, who thus despairing woo, And Rachel always fair. Ballade of the Muse Quem tu, Melpomene, semel. The man whom once, Melpomene, Thou look'st on with benignant sight, Shall never at the Isthmus be A boxer eminent in fight, Nor fares he foremost in the flight Of Grecian cars to victory, Nor goes with Delian laurels dight, The man thou lov'st, Melpomene! Not him the Capitol shall see, As who hath crush'd the threats and might Of monarchs, march triumphantly; But fame shall crown him, in his right Of all the Roman lyres that smite The first; so woods of Tivoli Proclaim him, so her waters bright, The man thou lov'st, Melpomene! The sons of queenly Rome count me, Me too, with them whose chants delight The poets' kindly company; Now broken is the tooth of spite, But thou, that temperest aright The golden lyre, all, all to thee He owes—life, fame, and fortune's height— The man thou lov'st, Melpomene— Envoy Queen, that to mute lips could'st unite The wild swan's dying melody— Thy gifts, ah, how shall he requite— The man thou lov'st, Melpomene?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vol. II VIII SONNETS The Sonnet Poet, beware! The sonnet's primrose path Is all too tempting for thy feet to tread. Not on this journey shalt thou earn thy bread, Because the sated reader roars in wrath: ‘Little indeed to say the singer hath, And little sense in all that he hath said; Such rhymes are lightly writ but hardly read, And naught but stubble is his aftermath.’ Then shall he cast that bonny book of thine Where the extreme waste-paper basket gapes; There shall thy futile fancies peak and pine, With other minor poets—pallid shapes, Who come a long way short of the divine, Tormented souls of imitative apes. In Ithaca ‘And now am I greatly repenting that ever I left my life with thee, and the immortality thou didst promise me.’—Letter of Odysseus to Calypso. Luciani Vera Historia. 'Tis thought Odysseus, when the strife was o'er With all the waves and wars, a weary while, Grew restless in his disenchanted isle, And still would watch the sunset, from the shore, Go down the ways of gold; and evermore His sad heart followed after, mile on mile, Back to the goddess of the magic wile, Calypso, and the love that was of yore. Thou too, thy haven gained, must turn thee yet To look across the sad and stormy space, Years of a youth as bitter as the sea, Ah, with a heavy heart, and eyelids wet; Because, within a fair forsaken place The life that might have been is lost to thee. Homer Homer, thy song men liken to the sea With all the notes of music in its tone, With tides that wash the dim dominion Of Hades, and light waves that laugh in glee Around the isles enchanted; nay, to me Thy verse seems as the river of source unknown That glasses Egypt's temples overthrown In his sky-nurtured stream, eternally. No wiser we than men of heretofore To find thy sacred fountains guarded fast; Enough, thy flood makes green our human shore, As Nilus Egypt, rolling down his vast, His fertile flood, that murmurs evermore Of gods dethroned, and empires in the past. Homeric Unity The sacred keep of Ilion is rent By shaft and pit; foiled waters wander slow Through plains where Simois and Scamander went To war with gods and heroes long ago. Not yet to tired Cassandra, lying low In rich Mycenae, do the fates relent: The bones of Agamemnon are a show And ruined is his royal monument. The dust and awful treasures of the dead Hath learning scattered wide; but vainly thee, Homer, she meteth with her tool of lead, And strives to rend thy songs; too blind to see The crown that burns on thine immortal head Of indivisible supremacy! The Odyssey As one that for a weary space has lain Lulled by the song of Circe and her wine, In gardens near the pale of Proserpine, Where that Æaean isle forgets the main, And only the low lutes of love complain, And only shadows of wan lovers pine; As such an one were glad to know the brine Salt on his lips, and the large air again— So gladly, from the songs of modern speech Men turn, and see the stars, and feel the free Shrill wind beyond the close of heavy flowers; And, through the music of the languid hours, They hear like ocean on a western beach The surge and thunder of the Odyssey. A Sonnet to Heavenly Beauty Du Bellay If this our little life is but a day In the Eternal—if the years in vain Toil after hours that never come again— If everything that hath been must decay, Why dreamest thou of joys that pass away My soul, that my sad body doth restrain? Why of the moment's pleasure art thou fain? Nay, thou hast wings—nay, seek another stay. There is the joy whereto each soul aspires, And there the rest that all the world desires; And there is love, and peace, and gracious mirth; And there in the most highest heavens shalt thou Behold the Very Beauty, whereof now Thou worshippest the shadow upon earth. Two Homes To a young English lady in the Hospital of the Wounded at Carlsruhe, Sept. 1870. What does the dim gaze of the dying find To waken dream or memory, seeing you? In your sweet eyes what other eyes are blue, And in your hair what gold hair on the wind Floats of the days gone almost out of mind? In deep green valleys of the Fatherland He may remember girls with locks like thine— May dream how, where the waiting angels stand, Some lost love's eyes are dim before they shine With welcome:—so past homes, or homes to be, He sees a moment, ere, a moment blind, He crosses death's inhospitable sea, And with brief passage of those barren lands Comes to the home that is not made with hands. San Terenzo (The village in the bay of Spezia, near which Shelley was living before the wreck of the Don Juan Mid April seemed like some November day, When through the glassy waters dull as lead Our boat, like shadowy barques that bear the dead, Slipped down the curved shores of the Spezian bay, Rounded a point—and San Terenzo lay Before us, that gay village, yellow and red, The roof that covered Shelley's homeless head— His house, a place deserted, bleak and gray. The waves broke on the door-step; fishermen Cast their long nets, and drew, and cast again. Deep in the ilex woods we wandered free, When suddenly the forest glades were stirred With waving pinions, and a great sea-bird Flew forth, like Shelley's spirit, to the sea! 1880. Love's Easter Love died here Long ago; O'er his bier Lying low, Poppies throw; Shed no tear; Year by year, Roses blow! Year by year, Adon—dear To Love's queen— Does not die! Wakes when green May is nigh! Twilight (After Richepin) Light has flown! Through the gray The wind's way, The sea's moan Sound alone! For the day These repay And atone! Scarce I know, Listening so To the streams Of the sea, If old dreams Sing to me! Two Sonnets of the Sirens ‘Les Sirènes estoient tant intimes amies et fidelles compagnes de Proserpine, qu'elles estoient toujours ensemble. Esmues du juste deuil de la perte de leur chère compagne, et ennuyees jusques au desespoir, elles s'arrestèrent à la mer Sicilienne, où par leurs chants elles attiroient les navigans, mais l'unique fin de la volupté de leur musique est la Mort.' —Pontus de Tyard, 1570. I The Sirens once were maidens innocent That through the water-meads with Proserpine Plucked no fire-hearted flowers, but were content Cool fritillaries and flag-flowers to twine, With lilies woven and with wet woodbine; Till once they sought the bright Etnæan flowers, And their bright mistress fled from summer hours With Hades, down the irremeable decline. And they have sought her all the wide world through, Till many years, and wisdom, and much wrong Have filled and changed their song, and o'er the blue Rings deadly sweet the magic of the song; And whoso hears must listen till he die Far on the flowery shores of Sicily. II So is it with this singing art of ours, That once with maids went maidenlike, and played With woven dances in the poplar-shade; And all her song was but of lady's bowers And the returning swallows, and spring-flowers, Till forth to seek a shadow-queen she strayed, A shadowy land; and now hath overweighed Her singing chaplet with the snow and showers. Yea, fair well-water for the bitter brine She left, and by the margin of life's sea Sings, and her song is full of the sea's moan, And wild with dread, and love of Proserpine; And whoso once has listened to her, he His whole life long is slave to her alone. Herodotus in Egypt From. Euterpe. He left the land of youth, he left the young, The smiling gods of Greece; he passed the isle Where Jason loitered, and where Sappho sung; He sought the secret-founted wave of Nile, And of their old world, dead a weary while, Heard the priests murmur in their mystic tongue, And through the fanes went voyaging, among Dark tribes that worshipped cat and crocodile. He learned the tales of death divine and birth, Strange loves of hawk and serpent, sky and earth, The marriage, and the slaying of the sun. The shrines of gods and beasts he wandered through, And mocked not at their godhead, for he knew Behind all creeds the Spirit that is One. Metempsychosis I shall not see thee, nay, but I shall know Perchance, thy gray eyes in another's eyes— Shall guess thy curls in gracious locks that flow On purest brows, yea, and the swift surmise Shall follow and track, and find thee in disguise Of all sad things and fair, where sunsets glow, When through the scent of heather, faint and low, The weak wind whispers to the day that dies. From all sweet art, and out of all old rhyme, Thine eyes and lips are light and song to me; The shadows of the beauty of all time, In song or story are but shapes of thee; Alas, the shadowy shapes! ah, sweet my dear, Shall life or death bring all thy being near? An Old Garden The autumn sun is warm, the soft winds moan, The golden fruits make sweet September air In gardens where the apple blossoms were Through these old Aprils that we twain have known. I pass along the pathways overgrown; Of all the flowers a single poppy there Droops her tired head, a faded flower and fair, One poppy that the wandering breeze hath sown. Here be no roses, and thou lack'st the rose; No lilies fragrant in the lily bed; One poppy in the bare untended close, Droops, and the sun is shrouded overhead; The gray sea-mist upon the sea-wind blows Chill; and methinks the summer-time is dead. A Star in the Night The perfect piteous beauty of thy face Is like a star the dawning drives away; Mine eyes may never see in the bright day Thy pallid halo, thy supernal grace; But in the night from forth the silent place Thou comest, dim in dreams, as doth a stray Star of the starry flock that in the gray Is seen, and lost, and seen a moment's space. And as the earth at night turns to a star, Loved long ago, and dearer than the sun, So in the spiritual place afar At night our souls are mingled and made one, And wait till one night fall, and one dawn rise, That brings no noon too splendid for your eyes. Love's Miracle With other helpless folk about the gate, The gate called Beautiful, with weary eyes That take no pleasure in the summer skies, Nor all things that are fairest, does she wait; So bleak a time, so sad a changeless fate Makes her with dull experience early wise, And in the dawning and the sunset, sighs That all hath been, and shall be, desolate. Ah, if love come not soon, and bid her live, And know herself the fairest of fair things; Ah, if he have no healing gift to give, Warm from his breast, and holy from his wings; Or if at least love's shadow in passing by Touch not and heal her, surely she must die. Dreams He spake not truth, however wise, who said That happy and that hapless men in sleep Have equal fortune, fallen from care as deep As countless, careless races of the dead. Not so, for alien paths of dreams we tread, And one beholds the faces that he sighs In vain to bring before his daylit eyes, And waking, he remembers on his bed. And one with fainting heart and feeble hand Fights a dim battle in a doubtful land, Where strength and courage were of no avail; And one is borne on fairy breezes far To the bright harbours of a golden star, Down fragrant fleeting waters rosy pale. Lost in Hades I dreamed that, somewhere in the shadowy place, Grief of farewell unspoken was forgot In welcome, and regret remembered not; And hopeless prayer accomplished turned to praise On lips that had been songless many days; Hope had no more to hope for, and desire And dread were overpast; in white attire New born we walked among the new world's ways! Then from the press of shades a spirit threw Towards me such apples as these gardens bear, And turning, I was 'ware of her, and knew And followed her fleet voice and flying hair— Followed, and found her not, and seeking you I found you never, dearest, anywhere. Natural Theology ???? ??? ?????? ?????? ??????????? ???????? ?????? ?? ???? ???????? ????????. Od. iii. 47. ‘Once Cagn was like a father, kind and good, But he was spoiled by fighting many things; He wars upon the lions in the wood, And breaks the thunder-bird's tremendous wings; But still we cry to him—We are thy brood— O Cagn, be merciful! and us he brings To herds of elands, and great store of food, And in the desert opens water-springs.’ So Qing, King Nqsha's Bushman hunter, spoke, Beside the camp-fire, by the fountain fair, When all were weary, and clouds of smoke Were fading, fragrant in the twilit air; And suddenly in each man's heart there woke A pang, a sacred memory of prayer. To Izaak Walton Old Izaak, in this angry age of ours— This hungry, angry age—how oft of thee We dream, and thy divine tranquillity; And all thy pleasure in the dewy flowers, The meads enamelled, and the singing showers, And shelter of the silvery willow-tree, By quiet waters of the river Lea! Ah, happy hours! we cry—ah, halcyon hours! Yet thou, like us, hadst trouble for this realm Of England: for thy dear Church mocked and rent, Thy friends in beggary, thy monarch slain, But naught could thy mild spirit overwhelm. Ah, Father Izaak, teach us thy content When time brings many a sorrow back again! Lines after Wordsworth Written under the influence of Wordsworth, with a siate-pencil on a window of the dining-room at the Lowood Hotel, Windermere, while waiting for tea after being present at the Grasmere Sports on a very wet day, and in consequence of a recent perusal of Belinda, a novel by Miss Broughton, whose absence is regretted. How solemn is the front of this hotel, When now the hills are swathed in modest mist, And none can speak of scenery, nor tell Of ‘tints of amber’, or of ‘amethyst’. Here once thy daughters, young romance, did dwell; Here Sara flirted with whoever list, Belinda loved not wisely but too well, And Mr. Ford played the philologist! Haunted the house is, and the balcony Where that fond matron knew her lover near; And here we sit, and wait for tea, and sigh, While the sad rain sobs in the sullen mere; And all our hearts go forth into the cry— Would that the teller of the tale were here! The Spinet My heart's an old spinet with strings To laughter chiefly tuned, but some That fate has practised hard on, dumb; They answer not whoever sings. The ghosts of half-forgotten things Will touch the keys with fingers numb, The little mocking spirits come And thrill it with their fairy wings. A jingling harmony it makes My heart—my lyre—my old spinet; And now a memory it wakes, And now the music means ‘forget’; And little heed the player takes Howe'er the thoughtful critic fret. Spinet. The accent is on the last foot, even when the word is written spinnet. Compare the remarkable liberty which Pamela took with the 137th Psalm:My Joys and Hopes all overthrown, My Heartstrings almost broke, Unfit my Mind for Melody, Much less to bear a Joke. But yet, if from my Innocence I, even in Thought, should slide, Then, let my fingers quite forget The sweet Spinnet to guide! Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded, vol. i, p. 184, 1785. A. L. CAMEOS SONNETS FROM THE ANTIQUE These versions from classical passages are pretty close to the original, except where compression was needed, as in the sonnets from Pausanias and Apuleius, or where, as in the case of fragments of Æschylus and Sophocles, a little expansion was required. Cameos The graver by Apollo's shrine Before the gods had fled, would stand, A shell or onyx in his hand, To copy there the face divine; Till earnest touches, line by line, Had wrought the wonder of the land Within a beryl's golden band, Or on some fiery opal fine. Ah! would that, as some ancient ring To us, on shell or stone, doth bring Art's marvels perished long ago, So I, within the sonnet's space, The large Hellenic lines might trace, The statue in the cameo! Helen on the Walls (Iliad, iii. 146.) Fair Helen to the Scæan portals came, Where sat the elders—peers of Priamus— Thymoetas, Hiketaon, Panthöus, And many another of a noble name, Famed warriors, now in council more of fame. Always above the gates, in converse thus They chattered like cicalas garrulous; Who marking Helen, swore ‘it is no shame That armed Achæan knights, and Ilian men For such a woman's sake should suffer long. Fair as a deathless goddess seemeth she. Nay, but aboard the red-prowed ships again Home let her pass in peace, not working wrong To us, and children's children yet to be.’ The Isles of the Blessed Pindar, Fr., 106, 107 (95): B. 4, 129-130, 109 (97): B. 4, 132: Now the light of the sun, in the night of the earth, on the souls of the true Shines, and their city is girt with the meadow where reigneth the rose; And deep is the shade of the woods, and the wind that flits o'er them and through, Sings of the sea, and is sweet from the isles where the frankincense blows. Green is their garden and orchard, with rare fruits golden it glows, And the souls of the Blessed are glad in the pleasures on earth that they knew, And in chariots these have delight, and in dice and in minstrelsy those; And the savour of sacrifice clings to the altars and rises anew. But the souls that Persephone cleanses from ancient pollution and stain, These at the end of the age—be they prince, be they singer, or seer— These to the world shall be born as of old, shall be sages again; These of their hands shall be hardy, shall live, and shall die, and shall hear Thanks of the people, and songs of the minstrels that praise them amain, And their glory shall dwell in the land where they dwelt, while year calls unto year! Death (Aesch., Fr., 156.) Of all gods Death alone Disdaineth sacrifice: No man hath found or shown The gift that Death would prize. In vain are songs or sighs, Pæan, or praise, or moan; Alone beneath the skies Hath Death no altar-stone! There is no head so dear That men would grudge to Death; Let Death but ask, we give All gifts that we may live; But though Death dwells so near, We know not what he saith. Nysa (Soph., Fr., 235; Aesch., Fr., 56.) On these Nysæan shores divine The clusters ripen in a day. At dawn the blossom shreds away; The berried grapes are green and fine And full by noon; in day's decline They're purple with a bloom of gray; And e'er the twilight plucked are they, And crushed, by nightfall, into wine. But through the night with torch in hand Down the dusk hills the maenads fare; The bull-voiced mummers roar and blare, The muffled timbrels swell and sound, And drown the clamour of the band Like thunder moaning underground. Colonus (Œd. Col., 667-705.) I Here be the fairest homes the land can show, The silvery-cliffed Colonus; always here The nightingale doth haunt and singeth clear, For well the deep green gardens doth she know. Groves of the god, where winds may never blow, Nor men may tread, nor noontide sun may peer Among the myriad-berried ivy dear, Where Dionysus wanders to and fro. For here he loves to dwell, and here resort These nymphs that are his nurses and his court; And golden eyed beneath the dewy boughs The crocus burns, and the narcissus fair Clusters his blooms to crown thy clustered hair, Demeter, and to wreathe the maiden's brows! II Yea, here the dew of heaven upon the grain Fails never, nor the ceaseless water-spring, Near neighbour of Cephisus wandering, That day by day revisiteth the plain. Nor do the goddesses the grove disdain, But chiefly here the Muses quire and sing, And here they love to weave their dancing ring, With Aphrodite of the golden rein. And here there springs a plant that knoweth not The Asian mead, nor that great Dorian isle, Unsown, untilled, within our garden plot It dwells—the gray-leaved olive; ne'er shall guile Nor force of foemen root it from the spot: Zeus and Athene guarding it the while! The Passing of Œdipus ((Œd. Col., 1655-1666.) How Œdipus departed, who may tell Save Theseus only? for there neither came The burning bolt of thunder and the flame To blast him into nothing, nor the swell Of sea-tide spurred by tempest on him fell. But some diviner herald none may name Called him, or inmost earth's abyss became The painless place where such a soul might dwell. Howe'er it chanced, untouched of malady, Unharmed by fear, unfollowed by lament, With comfort on the twilight way he went, Passing, if ever man did, wondrously; From this world's death to life, divinely rent, Unschooled in time's last lesson, how we die. The Taming of Tyro (Soph., Fr., 587.) (Sidero, the stepmother of Tyro daughter of Salmoneus, cruelly entreated her in all things, and chiefly in this, that she let sheer her beautiful hair.) At fierce Sidero's word the thralls drew near, And shore the locks of Tyro—like ripe corn They fell in golden harvest; but forlorn The maiden shuddered in her pain and fear, Like some wild mare that cruel grooms in scorn Hunt in the meadows, and her mane they sheer, And drive her where, within the waters clear, She spies her shadow, and her shame doth mourn. Ah! hard were he and pitiless of heart Who, marking that wild thing made weak and tame, Broken, and grieving for her glory gone, Could mock her grief; but scornfully apart Sidero stood, and watched a wind that came And tossed the curls like fire that flew and shone! To Artemis (Hippol., Eurip., 73-87.) For thee soft crowns in thine untrampled mead I wove, my lady, and to thee I bear; Thither no shepherd drives his flocks to feed, Nor scythe of steel has ever laboured there; Nay, through the spring among the blossoms fair The brown bee comes and goes, and with good heed Thy maiden, Reverence, sweet streams doth lead About the grassy close that is her care! Souls only that are gracious and serene By gift of god, in human lore unread, May pluck these holy blooms and grasses green That now I wreathe for thine immortal head— I that may walk with thee, thyself unseen, And by thy whispered voice am comforted. Criticism of Life (Hippol., Eurip., 252-266.) Long life hath taught me many things, and shown That lukewarm loves for men who die are best; Weak wine of liking let them mix alone, Not love, that stings the soul within the breast; Happy, who wears his love-bonds lightliest, Now cherished, now away at random thrown! Grievous it is for other's grief to moan, Hard that my soul for thine should lose her rest! Wise ruling this of life: but yet again Perchance too rigid diet is not well; He lives not best who dreads the coming pain And shunneth each delight desirable: Flee thou extremes, this word alone is plain, Of all that God hath given to Man to spell! The Cannibal Zeus A. D. 160. ??? ????? ?? ??????, ??? ???????? ??? ??? ????? ?? ???????? ?????? ??? ????? ?? ??? ??????? ?? ????????.—Paus. viii. 38. None elder city doth the sun behold Than ancient Lycosura; 'twas begun Ere Zeus the meat of mortals learned to shun; And here hath he a grove whose haunted fold The driven deer seek and huntsmen dread: 'tis told That whoso fares within that forest dun Thenceforth shall cast no shadow in the sun, Ay, and within the year his life is cold! Hard by dwelt he Lycaon, the first werewolf. who, while the gods deigned eat At good men's tables, gave them dreadful meat, A child he slew:—his mountain altar green Here still hath Zeus, with rites untold of me, Piteous, but as they are, let these things be, And as from the beginning they have been! Amaryllis (Theocritus, Idyll, iii.) Fair Amaryllis, wilt thou never peep From forth the cave, and call me, and be mine? Lo, apples ten I bear thee from the steep, These didst thou long for, and all these are thine. Ah, would I were a honey-bee to sweep Through ivy, and the bracken, and woodbine; To watch thee waken, love, and watch thee sleep, Within thy grot below the shadowy pine. Now know I Love, a cruel god is he, The wild beast bare him in the wild wood drear; And truly to the bone he burneth me. But, black-browed Amaryllis, ne'er a tear, Nor sigh, nor blush, nor aught have I from thee; Nay, nor a kiss, a little gift and dear. Invocation of Isis (Apuleius, Metamorph. XI.) Thou that art sandalled on immortal feet With leaves of palm, the prize of victory; Thou that art crowned with snakes and blossoms sweet, Queen of the silver dews and shadowy sky, I pray thee by all names men name thee by! Demeter, come, and leave the yellow wheat! Or Aphrodite, let thy lovers sigh! Or Dian, from thine Asian temple fleet! Or, yet more dread, divine Persephone From worlds of wailing spectres, ah, draw near; Approach, Selene, from thy subject sea; Come, Artemis, and this night spare the deer: By all thy names and rites I summon thee, By all thy rites and names, Our Lady, hear! The Coming of Isis So Lucius prayed, and sudden, from afar, Floated the locks of Isis, shone the bright Crown that is tressed with berry, snake, and star; She came in deep blue raiment of the night, Above her robes that now were snowy white, Now golden as the moons of harvest are, Now red, now flecked with many a cloudy bar, Now stained with all the lustre of the light. Then he who saw her knew her, and he knew The awful symbols borne in either hand; The golden urn that laves Demeter's dew, The handles wreathed with asps, the mystic wand; The shaken seistron's music, tinkling through The temples of that old Osirian land. TO POETS I Jacques Tahureau Ah thou! that, undeceived and unregretting, Saw'st death so near thee on the flowery way, And with no sigh that life was near the setting, Took'st the delight and dalliance of the day; Happy thou wert, to live and pass away Ere life or love had done thee any wrong; Ere thy wreath faded, or thy locks grew gray, Or summer came to lull thine April song, Sweet as all shapes of sweet things unfulfilled— Buds bloomless, and the broken violet, The first spring days, the sounds and scents thereof; So clear thy fire of song, so early chilled, So brief, so bright thy life that gaily met Death, for thy death came hand in hand with love. II François Villon List, all that love light mirth, light tears, and all That know the heart of shameful loves, or pure; That know delights depart, desires endure, A fevered tribe of ghosts funereal, Widowed of dead delights gone out of call; List, all that deem the glory of the rose Is brief as last year's suns, or last year's snows The new suns melt from off the sundial. All this your master Villon knew and sung; Despised delights, and faint foredone desire, And shame, a deathless worm, a quenchless fire; And laughter from the heart's last sorrow wrung, When half-repentance but makes evil whole, And prayer that cannot help wears out the soul. III Pierre Ronsard Master, I see thee with the locks of gray, Crowned by the Muses with the laurel-wreath; I see the roses hiding underneath, Cassandra's gift; she was less dear than they. Thou, Master, first hast roused the lyric lay— The sleeping song that the dead years bequeath— Hast sung sweet answer to the songs that breathe Through ages, and through ages far away. And thou hast heard the pulse of Pindar beat, Known Horace by the fount Bandusian! Their deathless line thy living strains repeat, But ah! thy voice is sad, thy roses wan, But ah! thy honey is not cloying sweet, Thy bees have fed on yews Sardinian. IV Gérard de Nerval Of all that were thy prisons—ah, untamed, Ah, light and sacred soul!—none holds thee now; No wall, no bar, no body of flesh, but thou Art free and happy in the lands unnamed, Within whose gates, on weary wings and maimed, Thou still wouldst bear that mystic golden bough The Sibyl doth to singing men allow, Yet thy report folk heeded not, but blamed. And they would smile and wonder, seeing where Thou stood'st, to watch light leaves, or clouds, or wind, Dreamily murmuring a ballad air, Caught from the Valois peasants; dost thou find A new life gladder than the old times were, A love more fair than Sylvie and as kind? V The Death of Mirandola ‘The Queen of Heaven appeared, comforting him and promising that he should not utterly die.’—Thomas More,, Life of Pico, Earl of Mirandola. Strange lilies came with autumn; new and old Were mingling, and the old world passed away, And the night gathered, and the shadows gray Dimmed the kind eyes and dimmed the locks of gold, And face beloved of Mirandola. The Virgin then, to comfort him and stay, Kissed the thin cheek, and kissed the lips acold, The lips unkissed of women many a day. Nor she alone, for queens of the old creed, Like rival queens that tended Arthur, there Were gathered, Venus in her mourning weed, Pallas and Dian; wise, and pure, and fair Was he they mourned, who living did not wrong One altar of its dues of wine and song. IX GAMES AND SPORT CRICKET, GOLF, FISHING Ballade of the Three Graces W. G. E. M. G. F. The three brothers whose prowess at cricket was the pride of Gloucestershire. In the mountains and meadows of Greece, In the holy, the delicate air, When Pan was the piper of peace, When the satyrs were all debonair, In the days dear to old Lemprière, The Graces would frolic and bound. Our Graces are still, we declare, The best men in England, all round! Though the season of midsummer cease The blossom of Hellas to bear, Though the critics, a cohort of geese, Deny that dame Venus is fair, The Graces, at least are ‘all there’, And no better bats to be found, And at point, or at long-leg, or square, The best men in England, all round! May Gilbert abide in the crease! And the bowling of Fred may it scare! And the slows of the coroner tease The colonists hugely that dare! Go smite them, ye brethren, nor spare! Till the glades of St. John's Wood resound With the cheers that are surely your share, The best men in England, all round! Envoy Old Glostershire, cast away care, And go in for a new county ground. Green mother of cricketers rare, The best men in England, all round! A Ballade of Mourning 1878 (The Australians at Lord's) The glories of the ball and bat, Alas! are unsubstantial things; Fate lays the stoutest wicket flat, Nor spares the game's anointed kings. Look on these ‘duck's-eggs’—ranged in strings; Hark to that shout—a losing cheer! Ah me! (the question soothes and stings) Where are the scores of yester-year? I'll wear a willow round my hat This day of days for many springs, And sitting where the patriarch sat, Spend the sad hours in murmurings That fortune should have spread her wings And sought the lower hemisphere, Singing, as melancholy sings, ‘Where are the scores of yester-year?’ The stump of Grace is taken—pat! Vain is the sceptre Hornby swings; Webbe, Ridley, Hearne—on this and that The bowlers' craft destruction brings. Fatal and strange, like stones from slings, Are Spofforth's ‘fasts’, and Boyle's. Oh, dear! Lord's with the lamentation sings, ‘Where are the scores of yester-year?’ Envoy Prince, though I know how fortune flings Her darts, and how they disappear, This thought my bosom racks and wrings— Where are the scores of yester-year? The Old Cricketer's Lament Ah, known or unknown playfellows Whom still the old Pavilion hears Serenely critical of slows, And wise with all the weight of years— Men who perchance remember Mynn, (Of these there are not very many) And Powys' pace and Butler's spin, And Francis, Ottaway, and Kenney. Can you recall a year like this? A year of rain, a year of woe? How many catches did we miss! Was cricket ever half so slow! Could that gray Bishop Bishop Charles Wordsworth of St. Andrews.—he who played So gallantly in'27— Have seen such dire fiascos made In all his years, by our Eleven? Nay, let the seasons come and fleet, Let us be missed from field and town, Let ancient cricketers who meet Hint that our wickets have gone down; They shall not see, they shall not weep Such weather and such strokes of fate, As we who sad and slowly creep From Lord's this awful '88. Death in June For Cricketers Only June is the month of Suicides Why do we slay ourselves in June, When life, if ever, seems so sweet? When ‘moon’, and ‘tune’, and ‘afternoon’, And other happy rhymes we meet; When strawberries are coming soon? ‘Why do we do it?’ you repeat! Ah, careless butterfly! to thee The strawberry seems passing good; And sweet, on music's wings, to flee Amid the waltzing multitude, And revel late—perchance till three— For love is monarch of thy mood! Alas, to us no solace shows For sorrows we endure—at Lord's, When Oxford's bowling always goes For ‘fours’ for ever to the cords— Or more, perhaps, with ‘overthrows’; These things can pierce the heart like swords. And thus it is though woods are green, Though mayflies down the Test are rolling; Though sweet, the silver showers between, The finches sing in strains consoling, We cut our throats for very spleen, And very shame of Oxford's bowling. Brahma (After Emerson) If the wild bowler thinks he bowls, Or if the batsman thinks he's bowled, They know not, poor misguided souls, They too shall perish unconsoled. I am the batsman and the bat, I am the bowler and the ball, The umpire, the pavilion cat, The roller, pitch, and stumps, and all. Ballade of Dead Cricketers Ah, where be Beldham now, and Brett, Barker, and Hogsflesh, where be they? Brett, of all bowlers fleetest yet That drove the bails in disarray? And Small that would, like Orpheus, play Till wild bulls followed his minstrelsy? So Nyren tells us. [A. L.] Booker, and Quiddington, and May? Beneath the daisies, there they lie! And where is Lambert, that would get The stumps with balls that broke astray? And Mann, whose balls would ricochet In almost an unholy way (So do baseballers ‘pitch’ to-day); George Lear, that seldom let a bye, And Richard Nyren, grave and gray? Beneath the daisies, there they lie! Tom Sueter, too, the ladies' pet, Brown, that would bravest hearts affray; Walker, invincible when set, (Tom, of the spider limbs and splay); Think ye that we could match them, pray, These heroes of Broad-halfpenny, With Buck to hit, and Small to stay? Beneath the daisies, there they lie! Envoy Prince, canst thou moralize the lay? How all things change below the sky! Of Fry and Grace shall mortals say, ‘Beneath the daisies, there they lie!’ To Helen (After seeing her bowl with her usual success.) St. Leonard's Hall. Helen, thy bowling is to me Like that wise Alfred Shaw's of yore, Which gently broke the wickets three: From Alfred few could smack a four: Most difficult to score! The music of the moaning sea, The rattle of the flying bails, The gray sad spires, the tawny sails— What memories they bring to me, Beholding thee! Upon our old monastic pitch, How sportsmanlike I see thee stand The leather in thy lily hand, O Helen of the yorkers, which Are nobly planned! Ballade of Cricket To T. W. L. The burden of hard hitting: slog away! Here shalt thou make a ‘five’ and there a ‘four’, And then upon thy bat shalt lean, and say, That thou art in for an uncommon score. Yea, the loud ring applauding thee shall roar, And thou to rival Thornton shalt aspire; When lo, the Umpire gives thee ‘leg before’— ‘This is the end of every man's desire!’ The burden of much bowling, when the stay Of all thy team is ‘collared’, swift or slower, When ‘bailers’ break not in their wonted way, And ‘yorkers’ come not off as here-to-fore; When length balls shoot no more—ah never more! When all deliveries lose their former fire, When bats seem broader than the broad barn-door— ‘This is the end of every man's desire!’ The burden of long fielding, when the clay Clings to thy shoon in sudden shower's downpour, And running still thou stumblest; or the ray Of blazing suns doth bite and burn thee sore, And blind thee till, forgetful of thy lore, Thou dost most mournfully misjudge a ‘skyer’, And lose a match the fates cannot restore— ‘This is the end of every man's desire!’ Envoy Alas, yet liefer on youth's hither shore Would I be some poor player on scant hire, Than king among the old, who play no more,— ‘This is the end of every man's desire!’ [A hope for the hopeless lips to frame] Verse written by A. L. in a copy of ‘XXII Ballades in Blue China’, 1880, given to C. J. L. by A. L. A hope for the hopeless lips to frame, 'Tis, oh, for a hard-hit innings of Game! W. H. Game scored 109 for Oxford v. Cambridge in 1876. A prayer unheard that the wild wind blows, 'Tis, oh, for an over of Ridley's Captain Oxford Eleven in 1875 and won the match v. Cambridge by six runs by putting himself on to bowl lobs and taking two wickets at the end of the innings. 1875 is known to cricketers as Ridley's Year. slows! GOLF A Song of Life and Golf The thing they ca' the stimy o't, I find it ilka where! Ye 'maist lie deid—an unco shot— Anither's ba' is there! Ye canna win into the hole, However gleg ye be, And aye, where'er ma ba' may roll, Some limmer stimies me! Chorus—Somebody stimying me, Somebody stimying me, The grass may grow, the ba' may row, Some limmer stimies me! I lo'ed a lass, a bonny lass, Her lips an' locks were reid; Intil her heart I couldna pass: Anither man lay deid! He cam' atween me an' her heart, I turned wi' tearfu' e'e; I couldna loft him, I maun part, The limmer stimied me! I socht a kirk, a bonny kirk, Wi' teind, an' glebe, an' a'; A bonny yaird to feed a stirk, An' links to ca' the ba'! Anither lad he cam' an' fleeched— A Convartit U.P.— An' a' in vain ma best I preached, That limmer stimied me! It's aye the same in life an' gowf; I'm stimied, late an' ear'; This world is but a weary howf, I'd fain be itherwhere. But whan auld deith wad hole ma corp, As sure as deith ye'll see Some coof has played the moudiewarp, Rin in, an' stimied me! Chorus (if thought desirable). Ode to Golf ‘Delusive nymph, farewell!’ How oft we've said or sung, When balls evasive fell, Or in the jaws of ‘Hell’, Or salt sea-weeds among, 'Mid shingle and sea-shell! How oft beside the burn, We play the sad ‘two more’; How often at the turn, The heather must we spurn; How oft we've ‘topped and swore’, In bent and whin and fern! Yes, when the broken head Bounds further than the ball, The heart has inly bled. Ah! and the lips have said Words we would fain recall— Wild words, of passion bred. In bunkers all unknown, Far beyond ‘Walkinshaw’, Where never ball had flown— Reached by ourselves alone— Caddies have heard with awe The music of our moan. Yet, nymph, if once alone, The ball hath featly fled— Not smitten from the bone— That drive doth still atone And one long shot laid dead Our grief to the winds hath blown. So, still beside the tee, We meet in storm or calm, Lady, and worship thee; While the loud lark sings free, Piping his matin psalm Above the gray, sad sea. Ballade of the Royal Game of Golf (East Fife) There are laddies will drive ye a ba' To the burn frae the farthermost tee; But ye mauna think driving is a’, Ye may heel her, and send her ajee, Ye may land in the sand or the sea; And ye're dune, sir, ye're no worth a preen, Tak' the word that an auld man 'll gie, Tak' aye tent to be up on the green! The auld folk are crouse, and they craw That their putting is pawky and slee; In a bunker they're nae gude ava', But to girn, and to gar the sand flee. And a lassie can putt—ony she,— Be she Maggy, or Bessie, or Jean; But a cleek-shot's the billy for me, Tak' aye tent to be up on the green! I hae play'd in the frost and the thaw, I hae play'd since the year thirty-three, I hae play'd in the rain and the snaw, And I trust I may play till I dee; And I tell ye the truth and nae lee, For I speak o' the thing I hae seen— Tom Morris, I ken, will agree— Tak' aye tent to be up on the green! Envoy Prince, faith you're improving a wee, And, Lord, man! they tell me you're keen; Tak' the best o' advice that can be, Tak' aye tent to be up on the green! Off my Game ‘I’m off my game,' the golfer said, And shook his locks in woe; ‘My putter never lays me dead, My drives will never go; Howe'er I swing, howe'er I stand, Results are still the same, I'm in the burn, I'm in the sand— I'm off my game! ‘Oh, would that such mishaps might fall On Laidlay or Macfie, That they might toe or heel the ball, And sclaff along like me! Men hurry from me in the street, And execrate my name, Old partners shun me when we meet— I'm off my game! ‘Why is it that I play at all? Let memory remind me How once I smote upon my ball, And bunkered it—behind me. I mostly slice into the whins, And my excuse is lame— It cannot cover half my sins— I'm off my game! I hate the sight of all my set, I grow morose as Byron; I never loved a brassey yet, And now I hate an iron. My cleek seems merely made to top, My putting's wild or tame; It's really time for me to stop— I'm off my game.’ Ballade of Roulette To R. R. This life—one was thinking to-day, In the midst of a medley of fancies— Is a game, and the board where we play Green earth with her poppies and pansies. Let manque be faded romances, Be passe remorse and regret; Hearts dance with the wheel as it dances— The wheel of Dame Fortune's roulette. The lover will stake as he may His heart on his Peggies and Nancies; The girl has her beauty to lay; The saint has his prayers and his trances; The poet bets endless expanses In dreamland; the scamp has his debt: How they gaze at the wheel as it glances— The wheel of Dame Fortune's roulette! The Kaiser will stake his array Of sabres, of Krupps, and of lances; An Englishman punts with his pay, And glory the jeton of France is; Your artists—or Whistlers or Vances, Have voices or colours to bet; Will you moan that its motion askance is— The wheel of Dame Fortune's roulette? Envoy The prize that the pleasure enhances? The prize is—at last to forget The changes, the chops, and the chances— The wheel of Dame Fortune's roulette. FISHING Piscatori Piscator In Memory of Thomas Tod Stoddart An angler to an angler here, To one who longed not for the bays, I bring a little gift and dear, A line of love, a word of praise, A common memory of the ways, By Elibank and Yair that lead; Of all the burns, from all the braes, That yield their tribute to the Tweed. His boyhood found the waters clean, His age deplored them, foul with dye; But purple hills, and copses green, And these old towers he wandered by, Still to the simple strains reply Of his pure unrepining reed, Who lies where he was fain to lie, Like Scott, within the sound of Tweed. The Contented Angler The Angler hath a jolly life Who by the rail runs down, And leaves his business and his wife, And all the din of town. The wind down stream is blowing straight, And nowhere cast can he: Then lo, he doth but sit and wait In kindly company. The miller turns the water off, Or folk be cutting weed, While he doth at misfortune scoff, From every trouble freed. Or else he waiteth for a rise, And ne'er a rise may see; For why, there are not any flies To bear him company. Or, if he mark a rising trout, He straightway is caught up; And then he takes his flasket out, And drinks a rousing cup. Or if a trout he chance to hook, Weeded and broke is he; And then he finds a goodly book Instructive company. The Last Cast The Angler's Apology Just one cast more! how many a year Beside how many a pool and stream, Beneath the falling leaves and sere, I've sighed, reeled up, and dreamed my dream! Dreamed of the sport since April first Her hands fulfilled of flowers and snow, Adown the pastoral valleys burst Where Ettrick and where Teviot flow. Dreamed of the singing showers that break, And sting the lochs, or near or far, And rouse the trout, and stir ‘the take’ From Urigil to Lochinvar. Dreamed of the kind propitious sky O'er Ari Innes brooding gray; The sea trout, rushing at the fly, Breaks the black wave with sudden spray! Brief are man's days at best; perchance I waste my own, who have not seen The castled palaces of France Shine on the Loire in summer green. And clear and fleet Eurotas still, You tell me, laves his reedy shore, And flows beneath his fabled hill Where Dian drave the chase of yore. And ‘like a horse unbroken’ yet The yellow stream with rush and foam, 'Neath tower, and bridge, and parapet, Girdles his ancient mistress, Rome! I may not see them, but I doubt If seen I'd find them half so fair As ripples of the rising trout That feed beneath the elms of Yair. Nay, spring I'd meet by Tweed or Ail, And summer by Loch Assynt's deep, And autumn in that lonely vale Where wedded Avons westward sweep, Or where, amid the empty fields, Among the bracken of the glen, Her yellow wreath October yields To crown the crystal brows of Ken. Unseen, Eurotas, southward steal! Unknown, Alpheus, westward glide! You never heard the ringing reel, The music of the water side! Though gods have walked your woods among, Though nymphs have fled your banks along; You speak not that familiar tongue Tweed murmurs like my cradle song. My cradle song—no other hymn I'd choose, nor gentler requiem dear Than Tweed's, that through death's twilight dim Mourned in the latest Minstrel's ear! Shameful Death (The keeper speaks) The biggest trout in the brook! His weight it was five pound clear; Never he'd wink at a hook, If you fished for him half the year, And in summer he lay where a tall flag shook In the thin at the tail o' the weir. He did not die by the line, He did not fall to the fly, Not fishing far and fine On the stream where he used to lie, But six bait hooks and a ball o' twine Brought that big trout to die! It was 'Arry from London town, A music-hall cad, and a fast; 'Arry, and Moses Brown, As had served before the mast, With young George Smith, a clod-hopping clown, Killed that big trout at last! It's a good long while since then— I'm a little bit stiff or so— But last year I and my men, Down there, where the alders grow, Rolled 'Arry from town in the mud o' the fen, And kicked him, and let him go! It's long since the big trout died, And my hair is mostly gray, But down by the water-side Mo bathed—on a Sabbath day! And Lor', sir, I laughed till I nearly cried, For we tuk his clothes away! Piscatrix Foot-deep in wet flowers and grasses, O playmate of sunshine and shade! What song has the stream as it passes? What song does it sing to its maid? Does it sing of the hills left behind it? Does it sing of the moorland and mist? Of the mosses that break it and bind it, Of flowers that its waters have kissed? Does it sing how it runs to the river? Shall it greatly delight it to be With the waters that murmur for ever To the death of the depths of the sea? The Salmo Irritans A most accommodating fish Is he who lies in stream or pot, Who rises frequent as you wish At Silver Doctor or Jock Scott, Or any other fly you've got In all the piscatory clans; You strike, but ah! you strike him not; He is the Salmo Irritans. You give him the accustomed rest; A quarter of an hour or so— And then you cast your very best, Your heart is throbbing, loud or low; He rises with a splendid show Of silver sides and fins like fans, Perchance you think you've got him? No! He is the Salmo Irritans. You leave him till the eventide, When wandering on by dub and pool A score of other casts you've tried, All fruitless and all beautiful; But he still rises, calm and cool, Who is not yours, nor any man's! He leaves you looking like a fool— He is the Salmo Irritans. Envoy Prince, wherefore comes he always short, This demon whom the angler bans? This is his selfish view of sport, He is the Salmo Irritans! The Last Chance Within the streams, Pausanias saith, That down Cocytus valley flow, Girdling the gray domain of Death, The spectral fishes come and go; The ghosts of trout flit to and fro. Persephone, fulfil my wish; And grant that in the shades below My ghost may land the ghosts of fish. Scots Wha Introduction to Walton's Compleat Angler, p. lviii (Dent, 1896). Scots wha fish wi' salmon roe, Scots wha sniggle as ye go, Will ye stand the Bailie? No! Let the limmer die! Now's the day and now's the time, Poison a' the burns wi' lime, Fishing fair's a dastard crime, We're for fishing free! The Philosophy of Fly-fishing Leave thou thy gillie, when he plays His local flies, his early views; Nor thou with shadowed hint confuse His notion of the hook that pays. X GHOSTS AND KINDRED SUBJECTS The Haunted Homes of England The haunted homes of England, How eerily they stand, While through them flit their ghosts—to wit, The Monk with the Red Hand; The Eyeless Girl—an awful spook— To stop the boldest breath, The boy that inked his copybook, And so got ‘wopped’ to death! Call them not shams—from haunted Glamis To haunted Woodhouselea, I mark in hosts the grisly ghosts I hear the fell Banshie! I know the spectral dog that howls Before the death of squires; In my ‘Ghosts'-guide’ addresses hide For Podmore and for Myers! I see the vampire climb the stairs From vaults below the church; And hark! the pirate's spectre swears! O psychical research, Canst thou not hear what meets my ear, The viewless wheels that come? The wild Banshie that wails to thee? The Drummer with his drum? O haunted homes of England, Though tenantless ye stand, With none content to pay the rent, Through all the shadowy land, Now, science true will find in you A sympathetic perch, And take you all, both grange and hall, For psychical research! Ghosts in the Library Suppose, when now the house is dumb, When lights are out, and ashes fall— Suppose their ancient owners come To claim our spoils of shop and stall; Ah me! within the narrow hall How strange a mob would meet and go, What famous folk would haunt them all, Octavo, quarto, folio! The great Napoleon lays his hand Upon this eagle-headed N, That marks for his a pamphlet banned By all but scandal-loving men— A libel from some nameless den Of Frankfort—Arnaud à la Sphère, Wherein one spilt, with venal pen, Lies o'er the loves of Molière. Another shade—he does not see ‘Boney’, the foeman of his race— The great Sir Walter, this is he With that grave homely Border face. He claims his poem of the chase That rang Benvoirlich's valley through; And this, that doth the lineage trace And fortunes of the bold Buccleuch. For these were his, and these he gave To one who dwelt beside the Peel, That murmurs with its tiny wave To join the Tweed at Ashestiel. Now thick as motes the shadows wheel, And find their own, and claim a share Of books wherein Ribou did deal, Or Roulland sold to wise Colbert. What famous folk of old are here! A royal duke comes down to us, And greatly wants his Elzevir, His pagan tutor, Lucius. And Beckford claims an amorous Old heathen in morocco blue; And who demands Eobanus But stately Jacques Auguste de Thou! They come—the wise, the great, the true— They jostle on the narrow stair, The joyous Countess de Verrue, Lamoignon, ay, and Longepierre, The new and elder dead are there— The lords of speech, and song, and pen— Gambetta, Schlegel, and the rare Drummond of haunted Hawthornden. Ah, and with those, a hundred more, Whose names, whose deeds, are quite forgot: Brave ‘Smiths’ and ‘Thompsons’ by the score, Scrawled upon many a shabby ‘lot’. This playbook was the joy of Pott— Pott, for whom now no mortal grieves; Our names, like his, remembered not, Like his, shall flutter on fly-leaves! At least in pleasant company We bookish ghosts, perchance, may flit; A man may turn a page, and sigh, Seeing one's name, to think of it. Beauty, or poet, sage, or wit, May ope our book, and muse awhile, And fall into a dreaming fit, As now we dream, and wake, and smile! Gainsborough Ghosts In the Grosvenor Gallery They smile upon the western wall— The lips that laughed an age agone, The fops, the dukes, the beauties all, Le Brun that sang, and Carr that shone. We gaze with idle eyes: we con The faces of an elder time— Alas! and ours is flitting on; Oh, moral for an empty rhyme! Think, when the tumult and the crowd Have left the solemn rooms and chill, When dilettanti are not loud, When lady critics are not shrill— Ah, think how strange upon the still Dim air may sound these voices faint; Once more may Johnson talk his fill And fair Dalrymple charm the saint! Of us they speak as we of them; Like us, perchance, they criticize: Our wit, they vote, is Brummagem; Our beauty—dim to Devon's eyes! Their silks and lace our cloth despise, Their pumps—our boots that pad the mud, What modern fop with Walpole vies? With St. Leger what modern blood? Ah true, we lack the charm, the wit, Our very greatest, sure, are small; And Mr. Gladstone is not Pitt, And Garrick comes not when we call. Yet—pass an age—and, after all, Even we may please the folk that look When we are faces on the wall, And voices in a history book! In art the statesman yet shall live, With collars keen, with Roman nose; To beauty yet shall Millais give The roses that outlast the rose: The lords of verse, the slaves of prose, On canvas yet shall seem alive, And charm the mob that comes and goes, And lives—in 1985. Ballade of a Choice of Ghosts Now, which are you anxious to see— A bogie, a sprite, or a gnome? If a spectre should drop in to tea, Would you like him to find us at home? Or a mermaid with mirror and comb, In her have you plenary faith? Or a lemur of classical Rome, Or a common respectable wraith? Here's the vampire, or Bronkola Ki, From his grave in old Greece hath he clomb; But perhaps he might bite us, and we Should be forced in his fashion to roam; Or a ginn from a Mussulman dome— He might work such unlimited scathe That we'd all turn as yellow as chrome— Or a common respectable wraith! From the ghost of our youth would you flee In his shroud that is dappled with loam? Or a faithful ancestral banshie? Or a martyr from some catacomb? Or a wizard with magical tome Whom his cerements becomingly swathe? Or a wili as fair as the foam? Or a common respectable wraith? Envoy Oh, the gloaming's beginning to gloam And (if Scotch is allowed) I am ‘laith’ To encounter a bogie or gnome, Or a common respectable wraith. The Disappointment As a matter of fact the Haunted House Committee of the Society for Psychical Research have never succeeded in seeing a ghost.—A. L. A house I took, and many a spook Was deemed to haunt that house, I bade the glum Researchers come With bogles to carouse. That house I'd sought with anxious thought, 'Twas old—'twas dark as sin, And deeds of bale, so ran the tale, Had oft been done therein. Full many a child its mother wild, Men said, had strangled there; Full many a sire, in heedless ire, Had slain his daughter fair! 'Twas rarely let: I can't forget A recent tenant's dread, This widow lone had heard a moan Proceeding from her bed. The tenants next were chiefly vexed By spectres grim and gray; A headless ghost annoyed them most, And so they did not stay. The next in turn saw corpse lights burn, And also a banshie, A spectral hand they could not stand, And left the house to me. Then came my friends for divers ends, Some curious, some afraid; No direr pest disturbed their rest Than a neat chambermaid. The grisly halls were gay with balls, One melancholy nook, Where ghosts galore were seen before, Now yielded ne'er a spook. When man and maid, all unafraid, ‘Sat out’ upon the stairs, No spectre dread, with feet of lead, Came past them unawares. I know not why, but alway I Have found that it is so, That when the glum Researchers come The brutes of bogeys—go. The Haunted Tower Suggested by a Poem of Théophile Gautier In front he saw the donjon tall Deep in the woods, and stayed to scan The guards that slept along the wall, Or dozed upon the bartizan. He marked the drowsy flag that hung Unwaved by wind, unfrayed by shower, He listened to the birds that sung— Go forth and win the baunted tower! The tangled brake made way for him, The twisted brambles bent aside; And lo, he pierced the forest dim, And lo, he won the fairy bride! For be was young, but ah! we find— All we, whose beards are flecked with gray, Our fairy castle's far behind, We watch it from the darkling way. 'Twas ours, that palace, in our youth; We revelled there in happy cheer, Who scarce dare visit now in sooth, Le Vieux Château de Souvenir! For not the boughs of forest green Begird that castle far away; There is a mist where we have been That weeps about it, cold and gray. And if we seek to travel back 'Tis through a thicket dim and sere, With many a grave beside the track, And many a haunting form of fear. Dead leaves are wet among the moss, With weed and thistle overgrown— A ruined barge within the fosse— A castle built of crumbling stone! The drawbridge drops from rusty chains; There comes no challenge from the hold; No squire, nor dame, nor knight remains, Of all who dwelt with us of old. And there is silence in the hall— No sound of songs, no ray of fire; But gloom where all was glad, and all Is darkened with a vain desire. And every picture's fading fast, Of fair Jehanne, or Cydalise. Lo, the white shadows hurrying past, Below the boughs of dripping trees! Ah rise, and march, and look not back, Now the long way has brought us here; We may not turn and seek the track To the old Château de Souvenir! The Ballade of the Subconscious Self Who suddenly calls to our ken The knowledge that should not be there; Who charms Mr. Stead with the pen Of the Prince of the Powers of the Air; Who makes physiologists stare— Is he ghost, is he demon, or elf? Who fashions the dream of the fair? It is just the Subconscious Self. He's the ally of medicine men Who consult the Australian bear, And 'tis he, with his lights on the fen, Who helps Jack o' Lanthorn to snare The peasants of Devon, who swear Under Commonwealth, Stuart, or Guelph, That they never had half such a scare— It is just the Subconscious Self. It is he, from his cerebral den, Who raps upon table and chair, Who frightens the housemaid, and then Slinks back, like a thief, to his lair: 'Tis the brownie (according to Mair) Who rattles the pots on the shelf, But the psychical sages declare ‘It is just the Subconscious Self’. Envoy Prince, each of us all is a pair— The Conscious, who labours for pelf, And the other, who charmed Mr. Blair, It is just the Subconscious Self. Song by the Subconscious Self (Rhymes made in a Dream) I know not what my secret is, I only know 'tis mine; I know to dwell with it were bliss, To die for it divine. I cannot yield it in a kiss, Nor breathe it in a sigh, I know that I have lived for this; For this, my love, I die. Ballade of Christmas Ghosts Between the moonlight and the fire In winter twilights long ago, What ghosts we raised for your desire To make your merry blood run slow! How old, how grave, how wise we grow! No Christmas ghost can make us chill, Save those that troop in mournful row— The ghosts we all can raise at will! The beasts can talk in barn and byre On Christmas Eve, old legends know; As year by year the years retire, We men fall silent then I trow; Such sights hath memory to show, Such voices from the silence thrill, Such shapes return with Christmas snow— The ghosts we all can raise at will. O children of the village choir, Your carols on the midnight throw; Oh bright across the mist and mire Ye ruddy hearths of Christmas glow! Beat back the dread, beat down the woe, Let's cheerily descend the hill; Be welcome all, to come or go, The ghosts we all can raise at will! Envoy Friend, sursum corda, soon or slow We part, like guests who've joyed their fill; Forget them not, nor mourn them so, The ghosts we all can raise at will! XI PICTURES and BUSTS A Nativity of Sandro Botticelli ‘Wrought in the troublous times of Italy By Sandro Botticelli,’ when for fear Of that last judgment, and last day drawn near To end all labour and all revelry, He worked and prayed in silence. This is she That by the holy cradle sees the bier, And in spice gifts, the hyssop on the spear, And out of Bethlehem, Gethsemane. Between the gold sky and the green o'er head, The twelve great shining angels, garlanded, Marvel upon her face, wherein combine The mother's love that shone on all of us, And maiden rapture that makes luminous The brows of Margaret and Catherine. The Lille Bust Was it Cæcilia or Felicula, Matron or maid, who wore this purity Of loveliness so fair it could not die Even with her death, but dwelt in the chill clay That might not fall to dust, nor know decay, Till years rolled into many a century, And peasants, delving where dead Romans lie, Found her, and worshipped, by the Appian Way? Then men, beholding her sweet face, forgot The Saints, forgot their living loves, and pined For this cold heart that might not throb nor feel. So the priests hid her in a secret spot; But one who bore her beauty in his mind, Made it twice deathless in the bust of Lille! Ideal Suggested by a female head in wax, of unknown date, but supposed to be either of the best Greek age, or a work of Raphael or Leonardo. It is now in the Lille Museum. Ah, mystic child of Beauty, nameless maid, Dateless and fatherless, how long ago, A Greek, with some rare sadness overweighed, Shaped thee, perchance, and quite forgot his woe! Or Raphael thy sweetness did bestow, While magical his fingers o'er thee strayed, Or that great pupil taught of Verrocchio Redeemed thy still perfection from the shade That hides all fair things lost, and things unborn, Where one has fled from me, that wore thy grace, And that grave tenderness of thine awhile. Nay, still in dreams I see her, but her face Is pale, is wasted with a touch of scorn, And only on thy lips I find her smile. A Portrait of 1783 Your hair and chin are like the hair And chin Burne-Jones's ladies wear; You were unfashionably fair In eighty-three, And sad you were when girls are gay, You read a book about Le vrai Mérite de l'homme, alone in May. What can it be, Le vrai mérite de l'homme? Not gold, Not titles that are bought and sold, Not wit that flashes and is cold, But virtue merely! Instructed by Jean-Jacques Rousseau (And Jean-Jacques, surely, ought to know), You bade the crowd of foplings go, You glanced severely, Dreaming beneath the spreading shade Of ‘that vast hat the Graces made’; Vous y verrez, belle Julie, Que ce chapeau tout maltraité Fut, dans un instant de folie, Par les Gràces même inventé. ‘À Julie.’ Essais en Prose et en Vers, par Joseph Lisle; Paris, An V de la Republique. So Rouget sang—while yet he played With courtly rhyme, And hymned great Doisi's red perruque, And Nice's eyes, and Zulmé's look, And dead canaries, ere he shook The sultry time With strains like thunder. Loud and low Methinks I hear the murmur grow, The tramp of men that come and go With fire and sword. They war against the quick and dead, Their flying feet are dashed with red, As theirs the vintaging that tread Before the Lord. O head unfashionably fair, What end was thine, for all thy care? We only see thee dreaming there: We cannot see The breaking of thy vision, when The Rights of man were lords of men, When virtue won her own again In ninety-three. Benedetta Ramus After Romney Mysterious Benedetta! who That Reynolds or that Romney drew Was ever half so fair as you, Or is so well forgot? These eyes of melancholy brown, These woven locks, a shadowy crown, Must surely have bewitched the town; Yet you're remembered not. Through all that prattle of your age, Through lore of fribble and of sage I've read, and chiefly Walpole's page, Wherein are beauties famous; I've haunted ball, and rout, and sale; I've heard of Devonshire and Thrale, And all the Gunnings' wondrous tale, But nothing of Miss Ramus. And yet on many a lattice pane ‘Fair Benedetta’, scrawled in vain By lovers' diamonds, must remain To tell us you were cruel. ‘I have broken many a pane of glass marked Cruel Parthenissa,’ says the aunt of Sophia Western in Tom Jones.—A. L. But who, of ail that sighed and swore— Wits, poets, courtiers by the score— Did win and on his bosom wore This hard and lovely jewel? Why, dilettante records say An alderman, who came that way, Woo'd you and made you Lady Day; You crowned his civic flame. It suits a melancholy song To think your heart had suffered wrong, And that you lived not very long To be a City dame! Perchance you were a Mourning Bride, And conscious of a heart that died With one who fell by Rodney's side In blood-stained Spanish bays. Perchance 'twas no such thing, and you Dwelt happy with your knight and true And, like Aurora, watch a crew Of rosy little Days! Oh, lovely face and innocent! Whatever way your fortunes went, And if to earth your life was lent For little space or long, In your kind eyes we seem to see What woman at her best may be, And offer to your memory An unavailing song! Colinette For a Sketch by Mr. G. Leslie, A.R.A. France your country, as we know; Room enough for guessing yet, What lips now or long ago Kissed and named you—Colinette. In what fields from sea to sea, By what stream your home was set; Loire or Seine was glad of thee, Marne or Rhone, O Colinette! Did you stand with maidens ten, Fairer maids were never seen, When the young king and his men Passed among the orchards green? Nay, old ballads have a note Mournful, we would fain forget; No such sad old air should float Round your young brows, Colinette. Say, did Ronsard sing to you, Shepherdess, to lull his pain, When the court went wandering through Rose pleasances of Touraine? Ronsard and his famous Rose Long are dust the breezes fret; You, within the garden close, You are blooming, Colinette. Have I seen you proud and gay, With a patched and perfumed beau, Dancing through the summer day, Misty summer of Watteau? Nay, so sweet a maid as you Never walked a minuet With the splendid courtly crew; Nay, forgive me, Colinette. Not from Greuze's canvases Did you cast a glance, a smile; You are not as one of these, Yours is beauty without guile. Round your maiden brows and hair Maidenhood and childhood met Crown and kiss you, sweet and fair, New art's blossom, Colinette. A Sunset of Watteau LUI The silk sail fills, the soft winds wake, Arise and tempt the seas; Our ocean is the Palace lake, Our waves the ripples that we make Among the mirrored trees. ELLE Nay, sweet the shore, and sweet the song, And dear the languid dream; The music mingled all day long With paces of the dancing throng, And murmur of the stream. An hour ago, an hour ago, We rested in the shade; And now, why should we seek to know What way the wilful waters flow? There is no fairer glade.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vol. III XIII BALLADS AND FOLK SONGS The Three Captains All beneath the white-rose tree Walks a lady fair to see, She is as white as the snows, She is as fair as the day: From her father's garden close Three knights have ta'en her away. He has ta'en her by the hand, The youngest of the three— ‘Mount and ride, my bonnie bride, On my white horse with me.’ And ever they rode, and better rode, Till they came to Senlis town; The hostess she looked hard at them As they were lighting down. ‘And are ye here by force,’ she said, ‘Or are ye here for play?’ ‘From out my father's garden close Three knights me stole away. ‘And fain would I win back,’ she said, ‘The weary way I come; And fain would see my father dear, And fain go maiden home.’ ‘Oh, weep not, lady fair,’ said she, ‘You shall win back,’ she said, ‘For you shall take this draught from me Will make you lie for dead.’ ‘Come in and sup, fair lady,’ they said, ‘Come busk ye and be bright; It is with three bold captains That ye must be this night.’ When they had eaten well and drunk, She fell down like one slain: ‘Now, out and alas! for my bonnie may Shall live no more again.’ ‘Within her father's garden stead There are three white lilies; With her body to the lily bed, With her soul to Paradise.’ They bore her to her father's house, They bore her all the three, They laid her in her father's close, Beneath the white-rose tree. She had not lain a day, a day, A day but barely three, When the may awakes, ‘Oh, open, father, Oh, open the door for me. ‘’Tis I have lain for dead, father, Have lain the long days three, That I might maiden come again To my mother and to thee.’ The Bridge of Death ‘The dance is on the Bridge of Death And who will dance with me?’ ‘There's never a man of living men Will dare to dance with thee.’ Now Margaret's gone within her bower Put ashes in her hair, And sackcloth on her bonnie breast, And on her shoulders bare. There came a knock to her bower door, And blithe she let him in; It was her brother from the wars, The dearest of her kin. ‘Set gold within your hair, Margaret, Set gold within your hair; And gold upon your girdle band, And on your breast so fair. ‘For we are bidden to dance to-night, We may not bide away; This one good night, this one fair night, Before the red new day.’ ‘Nay, no gold for my head, brother, Nay, no gold for my hair; It is the ashes and dust of earth That you and I must wear. ‘No gold work for my girdle band, No gold work on my feet; But ashes of the fire, my love, But dust that the serpents eat.’ They danced across the Bridge of Death Above the black water, And the marriage bell was tolled in hell For the souls of him and her. Le Père Sévère King Louis' Daughter ballad of the isle of france King louis on his bridge is he, He holds his daughter on his knee. She asks a husband at his hand That is not worth a rood of land. ‘Give up your lover speedily, Or you within the tower must lie.’ ‘Although I must the prison dree, I will not change my love for thee. ‘I will not change my lover fair Not for the mother that me bare. ‘I will not change my true lover For friends, or for my father dear.’ ‘Now where are all my pages keen, And where are all my serving men? ‘My daughter must lie in the tower alway, Where she shall never see the day.’ Seven long years are past and gone And there has seen her never one. At ending of the seventh year Her father goes to visit her. ‘My child, my child, how may you be?’ ‘O father, it fares ill with me. ‘My feet are wasted in the mould, The worms they gnaw my side so cold.’ ‘My child, change your love speedily Or you must still in prison lie.’ ‘'Tis better far the cold to dree Than give my true love up for thee.’ A Lady of High Degree I be pareld most of prise, I ride after the wild fee. Will ye that I should sing Of the love of a goodly thing, Was no vilein's may? 'Tis sung of a knight so free, Under the olive tree, Singing this lay. Her weed was of samite fine, Her mantle of white ermine, Green silk her hose; Her shoon with silver gay, Her sandals flowers of May, Laced small and close. Her belt was of fresh spring buds, Set with gold clasps and studs, Fine linen her shift; Her purse it was of love, Her chain was the flower thereof, And love's gift. Upon a mule she rode, The selle was of brent gold, The bits of silver made; Three red rose trees there were That overshadowed her, For a sun shade. She riding on a day, Knights met her by the way, They did her grace; ‘Fair lady, whence be ye?’ ‘France it is my countrie, I come of a high race. ‘My sire is the nightingale, That sings, making his wail, In the wild wood, clear; The mermaid is mother to me, That sings in the salt sea, In the ocean mere.’ ‘Ye come of a right good race, And are born of a high place, And of high degree; Would to God that ye were Given unto me, being fair, My lady and love to be.’ For a Rose's Sake I laved my hands By the water side; With the willow leaves My hands I dried. The nightingale sung On the bough of the tree; Sing, sweet nightingale, It is well with thee. Thou hast heart's delight, I have sad heart's sorrow For a false, false maid That will wed to-morrow. 'Tis all for a rose, That I gave her not, And I would that it grew In the garden plot. And I would the rose-tree Were still to set, That my love Marie Might love me yet. The Fragment of the Fause Lover and the Dead Leman Owillie rade, and Willie gaed Atween the shore and sea, And still it was his dead lady That kept him company. O Willie rade, and Willie gaed Atween the loch and heather, And still it was his dead lady That held his stirrup leather. ‘O Willie, tak' me up by ye, Sae far it is I gang; O tak' me on your saddle bow, Or your day shall not be lang.’ ‘Gae back, gae back, ye fause ill wife, To the grave wherein ye lie, It never was seen that a dead leman Kept lover's company ‘Gae back, gae back frae me,’ he said, ‘For this day maun I wed, And how can I kiss a living lass, When ye come frae the dead? ‘If ye maun haunt a living man, Your brither haunt,’ says he, ‘For it was never my knife, but his That twined thy life and thee!’ The Brigand's Grave A Ballad of Modern Greece The moon came up above the hill, The sun went down the sea; Go, maids, and fetch the well-water, But lad! come here to me. Gird on my jack and my old sword, For I have never a son; And you must be the chief of all, When I am dead and gone. But you must take my old broad sword, And cut the green boughs of the tree, And strew the green boughs on the ground To make a soft death-bed for me. And you must bring the holy priest That I may sained be; For I have lived a roving life Fifty years under the greenwood tree. And you shall make a grave for me, And dig it deep and wide; That I may turn about and dream With my old gun by my side. And leave a window to the east, And the swallows will bring the spring; And all the merry month of May The nightingales will sing. The Sudden Bridal It was a maid lay sick of love, All for a leman fair; And it was three of her bower-maidens That came to comfort her. The first she bore a blossomed branch, The second an apple brown, The third she had a silk kerchief, And still her tears ran down. The first she mocked, the second she laughed— ‘We have loved lemans fair, We made our hearts like the iron stone, Had little teen or care.’ ‘If ye have loved’ twas a false false love, And an ill leman was he; But her true love had angel's eyes, And as fair was his sweet body. ‘And I will gird my green kirtle, And braid my yellow hair, And I will over the high hills And bring her love to her.’ ‘Nay, if you braid your yellow hair, You'll twine my love from me.’ ‘Now nay, now nay, my lady good, That ever this should be!’ ‘When you have crossed the western hills My true love you shall meet, With a green flag blowing over him, And green grass at his feet.’ She has crossed over the high hills, And the low hills between, And she has found the may's leman Beneath a flag of green. 'Twas four and twenty ladies fair Were sitting on the grass; But he has turned and looked on her, And will not let her pass. ‘You've maidens here, and maidens there, And loves through all the land; But what have you made of the lady fair You gave the rose-garland?’ ‘She was so harsh and cold of love, To me gave little grace; She wept if I but touched her hand, Or kissed her bonnie face. ‘Yea, crows shall build in the eagle's nest, The hawk the dove shall wed, Before my old true love and I Meet in one wedding bed.’ When she had heard his bitter rede That was his old true love, She sat and wept within her bower, And moaned even as a dove. She rose up from her window seat, And she looked out to see; Her love came riding up the street With a goodly company. He was clad on with Venice gold, Wrought upon cramoisie, His yellow hair shone like the sun About his fair body. ‘Now shall I call him blossomed branch That has ill knots therein? Or shall I call him basil plant, That comes of an evil kin? ‘Oh, I shall give him goodly names, My sword of damask fine; My silver flower, my bright-winged bird— Where go you, lover mine?’ ‘I go to marry my new bride, That I bring o'er the down; And you shall be her bridal maid, And hold her bridal crown.’ ‘When you come to the bride chamber Where your fair maiden is, You'll tell her I was fair of face, But never tell her this, ‘That still my lips were lips of love, My kiss love's spring-water, That my love was a running spring, My breast a garden fair. ‘And you have kissed the lips of love And drained the well-water, And you have spoiled the running spring, And robbed the fruits so fair.’ ‘Now he that will may scatter nuts, And he may wed that will; But she that was my old true love Shall be my true love still.’ Iannoula All the maidens were merry and wed All to lovers so fair to see; The lover I took to my bridal bed He is not long for love and me. I spoke to him and he nothing said, I gave him bread of the wheat so fine; He did not eat of the bridal bread, He did not drink of the bridal wine. I made him a bed was soft and deep, I made him a bed to sleep with me; ‘Look on me once before you sleep, And look on the flower of my fair body. ‘Flowers of April and fresh May-dew, Dew of April and buds of May, Two white blossoms that bud for you, Buds that blossom before the day.’ The Milk-White Doe It was a mother and a maid That walked the woods among, And still the maid went slow and sad, And still the mother sung. ‘What ails you, daughter Margaret? Why go you pale and wan? Is it for a cast of bitter love, Or for a false leman?’ ‘It is not for a false lover That I go sad to see; But it is for a weary life Beneath the greenwood tree. ‘For ever in the good daylight A maiden may I go, But always on the ninth midnight I change to a milk-white doe. ‘They hunt me through the green forest With hounds and hunting men; And ever it is my fair brother That is so fierce and keen.’ ‘Good-morrow, mother.’ ‘Good-morrow, son; Where are your hounds so good?’ ‘Oh, they are hunting a white doe Within the glad greenwood. ‘And three times have they hunted her, And thrice she's won away; The fourth time that they follow her That white doe they shall slay.’ Then out and spoke the forester, As he came from the wood, ‘Now never saw I maid's gold hair Among the wild deer's blood. ‘And I have hunted the wild deer In east lands and in west; And never saw I white doe yet That had a maiden's breast.’ Then up and spake her fair brother, Between the wine and bread, ‘Behold, I had but one sister, And I have been her dead.’ ‘But ye must bury my sweet sister With a stone at her foot and her head, And ye must cover her fair body With the white roses and red. ‘And I must out to the greenwood, The roof shall never shelter me; And I shall lie for seven long years On the grass below the hawthorn tree.’ FOLK SONGS French Peasant Songs I O fair apple-tree, and O fair apple-tree! As heavy and sweet as the blossoms on thee, My heart is heavy with love. It wanteth but a little wind To make the blossoms fall; It wanteth but a young lover To win me heart and all. II I send my love letters By larks on the wing; My love sends me letters When nightingales sing. Without reading or writing, Their burden we know: They only say, ‘Love me, Who love you so.’ III And if they ask for me, brother, Say I come never home, For I have taken a strange wife Beyond the salt sea foam. The green grass is my bridal bed, The black tomb my good mother, The stones and dust within the grave Are my sister and my brother. The Tell-Tales All in the mirk midnight when I was beside you, Who has seen, who has heard, what was said, what was done? 'Twas the night and the light of the stars that espied you, The fall of the moon, and the dawning begun. 'Tis a swift star has fallen, a star that discovers To the sea what the green sea has told to the oars, And the oars to the sailors, and they of us lovers Go singing this song at their mistress's doors. XIV MISCELLANEOUS On the Death of Lord Tennyson Silence! ‘The best’ (he said) ‘are silent now, That younger bearer of the laurel bough, Who with his Thyrsis, kindred souls divine, Harps only for Sicilian Proserpine: For Arnold died, and Browning died, and he The oldest, wisest, greatest of the three— Dies, and what voice shall dirge for him to-day? For the Muse went with him the darkling way, And left us mute! . . . Peace! who shall rhyme or rave? The violet blooms not on the new-made grave, And not in this first blankness of regret Are eyes of men who mourn their Master wet. New grief is dumb: himself through many a year Withheld the meed of his melodious tear While Hallam slept. But no! the moment flies! And rapid rhymers, when the Poet dies, Wail punctual, and prompt, and unafraid, In copious instant ditties ready made. Oh, peace! Ye do but make our loss more deep, Who wail above his unawaking sleep. Our Fathers Not ‘better than our fathers’, we Can wisely boast ourselves to be; And evil may the scribbler speed Who vaunts the vaunt of Diomede! Our fathers eighty years ago, From Princes Street amazed the Row. From his far castle upon Tweed The Great Magician came at need, And every woman, man, and child Was gladder when the Shirra smiled; Nay, every tyke about the place Took pleasure in the Shirra's face! He, too, was here, the Giant Childe, Tender, magniloquent, and wild, Whose lure lay light on lochs and streams; Whose prose or weeps, or glooms, or gleams, As shower and shadow flit in turn O'er moor and tarn and ben and burn; Whose crutch fell heavier than he knew On laurelled crest or Cockney crew,— The mighty Christopher beside him He that ‘gules feared’ whene'er they spied him The Scorpion John Gibson Lockhart (1794-1854) was denounced as ‘the Scorpion’ in an anonymous pamphlet called Hypocrisy Unveiled, because of his satirical articles in Blackwood's Magazine. of the loyal heart, Who saw youth, love, and friends depart; Bearing dark sorrows in his breast Yet held his own and broke his jest— Crowned, as I deem, are men above, At once with Scott's and Carlyle's love! With them the Shepherd James Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd (1770-1835).: never plaid Of shepherd wrapped so strange a lad. Second alone was he to him Who turns all peasant glories dim. Oh, kindly heart and random tongue! That erst of fair Kilmeny sung, And taught how dreadfully he died, The Sinner, Lost and Justified, And turned to rhyme and told in prose The fortunes of the Fallen Rose— These were our Fathers: truly we Scarce better men may boast to be! Scythe Song Mowers, weary and brown, and blithe, What is the word methinks ye know— Endless over-word that the scythe Sings to the blades of the grass below? Scythes that swing in the grass and clover, Something, still, they say as they pass; What is the word that, over and over, Sings the scythe to the flowers and grass? Hush, ah bush, the scythes are saying, Hush, and beed not, and fall asleep; Hush, they say to the grasses swaying, Hush, they sing to the clover deep! Hush—'tis the lullaby Time is singing— Hush, and beed not, for all things pass, Hush, ah hush! and the scythes are swinging Over the clover, over the grass. Tired of Towns ‘When we spoke to her of the New Jerusalem, she said she would rather go to a country place in Heaven.’—Letters from the Black Country. I'm weary of towns, it seems a'most a pity We didn't stop down i' the country and clem Lancashire for hunger.; And you say that I'm bound for another city, For the streets o' the New Jerusalem. And the streets are never like Sheffield, here, Nor the smoke don't cling like a smut to them; But the water o' life flows cool and clear Through the streets o' the New Jerusalem. And the houses, you say, are of jasper cut, And the gates are gaudy wi' gold and gem; But there's times I could wish as the gates were shut— The gates o' the New Jerusalem. For I come from a country that's over-built Wi' streets that stifle, and walls that hem; And the gorse on a common's worth all the gilt And the gold of your New Jerusalem. And I hope that they'll bring me, in Paradise, To green lanes leafy wi' bough and stem— To a country place in the land o' the skies, And not to the New Jerusalem. Pen and Ink Ye wanderers that were my sires, Who read men's fortunes in the hand, Who voyaged with your smithy fires From waste to waste across the land— Why did you leave for garth and town Your life by heath and river's brink? Why lay your gipsy freedom down And doom your child to Pen and Ink? You wearied of the wild-wood meal That crowned, or failed to crown, the day; Too honest or too tame to steal You broke into the beaten way: Plied loom or awl like other men, And learned to love the guineas' chink— Oh, recreant sires, who doomed me then To earn so few—with Pen and Ink! Where it hath fallen the tree must lie, 'Tis over late for me to roam; Yet the caged bird who hears the cry Of his wild fellows fleeting home, May feel no sharper pang than mine, Who seem to hear, whene'er I think, Spate in the stream and wind in pine, Call me to quit dull Pen and Ink. For then the spirit wandering, That slept within the blood, awakes; For then the summer and the spring I fain would meet by streams and lakes; But ah, my birthright long is sold, But custom chains me, link on link, And I must get me, as of old, Back to my tools—to Pen and Ink. Disillusions of Astronomy I once took delight In the meteorite; I was eager his passage to scan, For I said, ‘From some far And mysterious star He is bearing his message to man. ‘In sidereal showers There is metal like ours; They have iron, and therefore have wars; It is easy to think They may be on the brink Of a social convulsion in Mars.’ So I followed the flight Of the meteorite; I was eager his journey to scan; For I deemed that he came On his pathway of flame For the edification of man. But, alas! I have read That his journey is sped From the earth, as she once was of yore, When the globe was red-hot, And Vesuvius shot Stones at six miles a second or more. From Vesuvius' cup There were rocks that flew up, Out of gravity's reach; now they fall! Which accounts for the flight Of the meteorite, As I read in Astronomer Ball. So he brings us no news From the stars we peruse, Or in hope, or in terror survey; He is only a stone From the world that was thrown When the earth was an infant at play. He conveyed us no germs Of amœbæ, or worms, As Sir William conjectured of yore; Whence he came doth he fall, Thinks Astronomer Ball: Life's a mystery, much as before. And the creeds that come down, With a smile or a frown, To the earth, from the world's walls of flame: Are they guesses and fears, That flew up to the spheres, And return to the hearts whence they came? So Dame Science avers; But these fancies of hers, They are vague as the wandering breeze; And concerning the flight Of the meteorite, And the rest—I'll believe what I please. Zimbabwe (The ruined Gold Cities of Rhodesia. The Ophir of Scripture.) Into the darkness whence they came, They passed—their country knoweth none, They and their gods without a name Partake the same oblivion. Their work they did, their work is done, Whose gold, it may be, shone like fire About the brows of Solomon, And in the House of God's Desire. Hence came the altar all of gold, The hinges of the Holy Place, The censer with the fragrance rolled Skyward to seek Jehovah's face; The golden ark that did encase The Law within Jerusalem, The lilies and the rings to grace The high priest's robe and diadem. The pestilence, the desert spear, Smote them; they passed with none to tell The names of them that laboured here: Stark walls and crumbling crucible, Strait gates, and graves, and ruined well, Abide, dumb monuments of old, We know but that men fought and fell, Like us—like us—for love of gold. A Review in Rhyme A little of Horace, a little of Prior, A sketch of a milkmaid, a lay of the squire— These, these are ‘on draught’ ‘At the Sign of the Lyre!’ At the Sign of the Lyre, by H. A. Dobson, 1885. A child in blue ribbons that sings to herself, A talk of the books on the Sheraton shelf, A sword of the Stuarts, a wig of the Guelph, A lai, a pantoum, a ballade, a rondeau, A pastel by Greuze, and a sketch by Moreau, And the chimes of the rhymes that sing sweet as they go; A fan, and a folio, a ringlet, a glove, 'Neath a dance by Laguerre on the ceiling above, And a dream of the days when the bard was in love; A scent of dead roses, a glance at a pun, A toss of old powder, a glint of the sun, They meet in the volume that Dobson has done. If there's more that the heart of a man can desire, He may search in his Swinburne, for fury and fire; If he's wise—he'll alight ‘At the Sign of the Lyre!’ The Banks of Wye Once more we watch the fields we knew, Once more the valley fair, Moonlight, and silence, and the dew Are dreaming on the air: Ah, silence! not a curlew's cry To vex the midnight still, 'Tis only Wye goes moaning by Beneath the shadowy hill. Say, is it long ago she smiled Here, in the birchen wood, With sweetest eyes that ever child Wore into womanhood? And now we watch the hills alone, And Wye, his banks along, Must sound, for us, a parting moan; For her—a bridal song. Well, so doth Heaven or fate decide, And time has willed it so: Farewell to bridegroom and to bride, Farewell to long ago! And years and faces change, and feet In alien regions range, And souls may meet, or ne'er may meet, But one can never change. An Aspiration When we have cut each other's throats And robbed each other's land; And turned, and changed, and lost our coats, Till progress is at stand; When every ‘programme's’ been gone through This good old world will wake anew! When science, art, and learning cease As wealth and commerce die— The children they of wealth and peace, With peace and wealth they fly— Then ghosts will walk, and in their train Bring old religion back again. When hunger, war, and pestilence Have run their ancient round; When law has long been banished hence; When hate has cleared the ground; When men grown few, as once they were, Breathe uncontaminated air— Till then I fain would sleep, and then Be born in other days— A hermit in some happy glen Where some clear river strays; Nursed in some faith—I know not, I— Wherein a man might live and die. Ah, early would I rise to pray, And early would I steal From chapel, in the dawning gray, To earn the Friday's meal— A monk who never dreamed of doubt, I'd catch uneducated trout! A priest where woman might not come, Nor any household care; A land where newspapers were dumb From scandal and from scare— That priest I'd be, that land I'd see, Would fortune work my wish for me! O Buddha, if thy tale be true, Of still returning life; A monk may I be born anew In valleys far from strife— A monk where Meggatt winds and laves The lone St. Mary's of the waves. The ruined Chapel of Our Lady on St. Mary's Loch at the head of Yarrow, ‘The lone St. Mary's of the waves’ is a charming line by Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd. Tout finit par des Chansons (Ballade en guise de Rondeau) All ends in song! Dame Nature toiled In stellar space, by land, by sea; And many a monstrous thing she spoiled, And many another brought to be; Strange brutes that sprawled, strange stars that flee, Or flare the steadfast signs among: What profit thence—to you or me? All ends in song! All ends in song! But Nature moiled And brought forth Man, who deems him free, Who dreams 'twas his own hand embroiled The tangles of his destiny: Who fashioned empires—who but he?— Who fashioned gods, a motley throng: They fall, they fade by Time's decree— All ends in song! All ends in song! we strive, are foiled, Are broken-hearted—even we: Where that old sinful snake is coiled We shake the knowledgeable tree, We listen to the serpent's plea, ‘As gods shall ye know right and wrong’— And this is all the mystery— ‘All ends in song.’ Envoy Muse, or in sooth or mockery, Or brief of days, or lasting long, Our love, or hate, or gloom, or glee— All ends in song. A Dream Why will you haunt my sleep? You know it may not be; The grave is wide and deep, That sunders you and me; In bitter dreams we reap The sorrow we have sown, And I would I were asleep, Forgotten and alone! We knew and did not know— We saw and did not see, The nets that long ago Fate wove for you and me; The cruel nets that keep The birds that sob and moan; And I would we were asleep, Forgotten and alone! The Grave of Orpheus The story about the suicide of Orpheus, after the second loss of Eurydice, and about the nightingales that sing over his tomb, is in Pausanias. 'Twas hence the Thracian minstrel went The second time the sunless way, And found his twice-lost love, content 'Mid songless shades to be as they; But the songs died not—all the May And all through June they flood the vales, And still on Orpheus' tomb, men say, Most sweetly sing the nightingales. The Melancholy Muses A weary lot is his who longs For something bright in rhyme; Men, women, children send me songs Sepulchral or sublime. The songs are all of bale and blight; Alas! I do not need them, For almost every one can write, And nobody can read them! Has merriment gone wholly out? Have all the hearts been broken? Must every mortal sing of doubt, From Peebles to Portsoken? Men rhyme of penalties and pains, Forgetting joy and wassail; The Muses dwell with stripes and chains In Bunyan's Doubting Castle. Ah, there have all the pleasures fled, The Cupids all departed, The Muses that to dance we led, Light-footed and light-hearted! Will ne'er a knight go blow the horn, And knock that giant over, Dispel the dark, let in the morn, Give every Muse a lover? Sad maiden Muses, vowed to pain, Too long, perchance, they've tarried; There never will be joy again Till every Muse is married! ??????? ???? I would my days had been in other times, A moment in the long unnumbered years That knew the sway of Horus and of hawk, In peaceful lands that border on the Nile. I would my days had been in other times, Lulled by the sacrifice and mumbled hymn Between the five great rivers, or in shade And shelter of the cool Himâlyan hills. I would my days had been in other times, That I in some old abbey of Touraine Had watched the rounding grapes, and lived my life, Ere ever Luther came or Rabelais! I would my days had been in other times, When quiet life to death not terrible Drifted, as ashes of the Santhal dead Drift down the sacred rivers to the sea! The Old Love and the New How oft I've watched her footstep glide Across th' enamelled plain, And deemed she was the fairest bride And I the fondest swain! How oft with her I've cast me down Beneath the odorous limes, How often twined her daisy crown, In the glad careless times! By that old wicket ne'er we meet Where still we met of yore, But I have found another sweet Beside the salt sea-shore: With sea-daisies her locks I wreathe, With sea-grass bind her hands, And salt and sharp's the air we breathe Beside the long sea-sands! Mine own true love had eyes of blue, And Willow! was her song; Sea-green her eyes, my lady new, And of the east her tongue. And she that's worsted in the strife, A southland lass is she; But she that's won—the Neuk o' Fife, It is her ain countrie! No more the old sweet words we call, These kindly words of yore— ‘Over!’ ‘Hard in!’ ‘Leg-bye!’ ‘No ball!’ Ah, now we say ‘Two more’; And of the ‘Like’ and ‘Odd’ we shout, Till swains and maidens scoff; ‘The fact is, cricket's been bowled out By that eternal golf!’ A Remonstrance with the Fair There are thoughts that the mind cannot fathom, The mind of the animal male; But woman abundantly hath 'em, And mostly her notions prevail. And why ladies read what they do read Is a thing that no man may explain, And if any one asks for a true rede He asketh in vain. Ah, why is each ‘passing depression’ Of stories that gloomily bore, Received as the subtle expression Of almost unspeakable lore? In the dreary, the sickly, the grimy Say, why do our women delight? And wherefore so constantly ply me With Ships in the Night? Dear ladies, in vain you approach us, With books to your taste in your hands; For, alas! though you offer to coach us, Yet the soul of no man understands Why the grubby is always the moral, Why the nasty's preferred to the nice, While you keep up a secular quarrel With a gay little Vice; Yes, a Vice with her lips full of laughter, A Vice with a rose in her hair, You condemn in the present and after, To darkness of utter despair: But a sin, if no rapture redeem it, But a passion that's pale and played out, Or in surgical hands—you esteem it Worth scribbling about! What is sauce for the goose, for the gander Is sauce, ye inconsequent fair! It is better to laugh than to maunder, And better is mirth than despair; And though life's not all beer and all skittles, Yet the sun, on occasion, can shine, And, mon Dieu! he's a fool who belittles This cosmos of Thine! There are cakes, there is ale—ay, and ginger Shall be hot in the mouth, Sir Toby. Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?Clown. Yes, by St. Anne! and ginger shall be hot in the mouth too. Twelfth Night, 11. iii. as of old: And a villain, with cloak and with whinger, And a hero, in armour of gold, And a maid with a face like a lily, With a heart that is stainless and gay, Make a tale worth a world of the silly Sad trash of to-day. The Lover in Hades Persephone Now take and eat, and have release; And memory, and longing leave; Then shall the seasons pass in peace Wherein thou dost not grieve. Thou wouldst not suffer for love's sake Longer, and longer idly crave? The Lover The pomegranate I will not take, Nor drink the mystic wave: I had a lady, passing dear, And fair, beneath earth's windy skies— And but one joy I fail of here— To look into her eyes. And if she keep my memory, I know mine shall be sadder yet. But if she quite forgetteth me, Yet will I not forget! [On the centenary of Robert Burns in 1896 Lord Rosebery addressed two meetings held to celebrate it on the same day, first in Dumfries and then in Glasgow. Both speeches were remarkable, casting fresh light on a well-worn theme.] Lord Rosebery loquitur Was I ever sae tormentit? I'm nearly driven dementit. The things I hae inventit To speak about the Bard Are mony and meritorious, So say the maist censorious; But, oh! it's fair notorious To find new things is hard! Ma very sleep is broken wi't, The Glorious Shade I've spoken wi't, Poetic thirst I've sloken wi't, But, faith! I'm rinning oot; And here's another bust, ye ken, And talk on it I must, ye ken, For Paisley pits her trust, ye ken, In me, and has nae doot. Faith, a' the Sultan's meenions I'll curse, and ma opeenions About the puir Armenians I'll speak and mak' ma maen. Though Robbie never heard o' them, His heart would hae been stirred for them, And speaking out my word for them Kills twa birds wi' ae stane! A Song of Patents A've three pair o' patent shune, An' they're a' for gowfin' in, But, lord! they gi'e a body unco fa's! It's forward now ye'll coup, And now ye'll rax your dowp, And ye stotter whan addressing till your ba's. But they're patents, ye maun ken, And the race of thinking men Maunna dare the things their faithers likit weel; So we've Companies and Shares And bonnie Bulls and Bears, Or the country wad be gangin' to the de'il! A've a braw new patent cleek, Like a Plawtypuss's beak, And they threip that it is excellent in sand; But, if I tap my ba' It slices it in twa; Yet a' the shop-fowk tell me it is grand! The name I canna utter O' my braw new patent putter, For the name it is derivit frae the Greek; But I canna hole a ba' off it, In fact I ha'e a staw staw, a surfeit. of it— But no to use a ‘patent’ wad be weak. Yestreen I saw a lassie Foozle wi' a patent brassie, And I bocht ane on the spot for seven-and-three; And that same lass has coft coft, bought. her An amazin' patent lofter, And she halvit the short hole in twenty-three. A'm mysel' the sole survivor O' the last new patent driver, For it split and killed my pairtners on the green; And a splinter slew my caddie (A wiedy's son, puir laddie!) But—a ‘patent’ is the sicht for the sair eyne. For we've ‘patents’ a', ye ken, And the race of thinking men Maunna use the clubs their faithers likit weel; So we've Companies and Shares And we've bonnie Bulls and Bears, Or the country wad be gangin' to the de'il! Fairyland In light of sunrise and sunsetting The long days lingered, in forgetting That ever passion, keen to hold What may not tarry, was of old, In lands beyond the weary wold— Beyond the bitter stream whose flood Runs red waist-high with slain men's blood. Was beauty once a thing that died? Was pleasure never satisfied? Was rest still broken by the vain Desire of action, bringing pain, To die in vapid rest again? All this was quite forgotten there, No winter brought us cold and care, No spring gave promise unfulfilled, Nor, with the eager summer killed, The languid days drooped autumnwards. So magical a season guards The constant prime of a green June; So slumbrous is the river's tune, That knows no thunder of rushing rains, Nor ever in the summer wanes, Like waters of the summer time In lands far from the fairy clime. Yea, there the fairy maids are kind, With nothing of the changeful mind Of maidens in the days that were; And if no laughter fills the air With sound of silver murmurings, And if no prayer of passion brings A love nigh dead to earth again Yet sighs more subtly sweet remain And smiles that never satiate, And loves that fear scarce any fate— Alas! no words can bring the bloom Of Fairyland, the faint perfume, The sweet low light, the magic air, To those who have not yet been there: Alas! no words, nor any spell Can lull the heart that knows too well The towers that by the river stand, The lost fair world of Fairyland. Ah, would that I had never been The lover of the Fairy Queen! Or would that I again might be Asleep below the Eildon tree, And see her ride the forest way As on that morning of the May! Omar Khayyam Wise Omar, do the southern breezes fling Above your grave, at ending of the spring, The snowdrift of the petals of the rose, The wild white roses you were wont to sing? Far in the south I know a land divine, And there is many a saint and many a shrine, And over all the shrines the blossom blows Of roses that were dear to you as wine. You were a saint of unbelieving days, Liking your life and happy in men's praise; Enough for you the shade beneath the bough, Enough to watch the wild world go its ways. Dreadless and hopeless thou of heaven or hell, Careless of words thou hadst not skill to spell, Content to know not all thou knowest now, What's death? Doth any pitcher dread the well? The pitchers we, whose maker makes them ill, Shall he torment them if they chance to spill? Nay, like the broken potsherds are we cast Forth and forgotten—and what will be will! So still were we, before the months began That rounded us and shaped us into man. So still we shall be, surely, at the last, Dreamless, untouched of blessing or of ban! Ah, strange it seems that this thy common thought— How all things have been, ay, and shall be nought— Was ancient wisdom in thine ancient east, In those old days when Senlac fight was fought, Which gave our England for a captive land To pious chiefs of a believing band— A gift to the believer from the priest, Tossed from the holy to the blood-red hand! Yea, thou wert singing when that arrow clave Through helm and brain of him who could not save His England, even of Harold Godwin's son; The high tide murmurs by the hero's grave! And thou wert wreathing roses—who can tell?— Or chanting for some girl that pleased thee well, Or satst at wine in Nashâpûr, when dun The twilight veiled the field where Harold fell! The salt sea-waves above him rage and roam! Along the white walls of his guarded home No zephyr stirs the rose, but o'er the wave The wild wind beats the breakers into foam! And dear to him, as roses were to thee, Rings the long roar of onset of the sea; The Swan's Bath of his Fathers is his grave: His sleep, methinks, is sound as thine can be. His was the age of faith, when all the west Looked to the priest for torment or for rest; And thou wert living then, and didst not heed The saint who banned thee or the saint who blessed! Ages of Progress! These eight hundred years Hath Europe shuddered with her hopes or fears, And now!—she listens in the wilderness To thee, and half believeth what she hears! Hadst thou THE SECRET? Ah, and who may tell? ‘An hour we have,’ thou saidst; ‘Ah, waste it well!’ An hour we have, and yet eternity Looms o'er us, and the thought of heaven or hell. Nay, we can never be as wise as thou, O idle singer 'neath the blossomed bough! Nay, and we cannot be content to die. We cannot shirk the questions ‘where?’ and ‘how?’ Ah, not from learned peace and gay content Shall we of England go the way be went— The singer of the red wine and the rose— Nay, otherwise than his our day is spent! Serene he dwelt in fragrant Nashâpûr, But we must wander while the stars endure. He knew THE SECRET: we have none that knows; No man so sure as Omar once was sure! Waitin' on the Glesca' Train When the holidays come roun' And on pleasure ye are boun', For the Trossachs, Brig o' Allan or Dunblane; You'll be sometimes keepit waitin' When ye hear the porter statin' That ye're waitin' on the Glesca' train.Chorus Tak' yer time—tak' yer time! With indifference sublime, Ye may watch the people hurry micht an' main; Just tak' a seat an' wait, For ye canna be ower late, When ye're waitin' on the Glesca' train.

The Shade of Helen Some say that Helen never went to Troy, but abode in Egypt; for the gods, having made in her semblance a woman out of clouds and shadows, sent the same to be wife to Paris. For this shadow then the Greeks and Trojans slew each other. Why from the quiet hollows of the hills, And extreme meeting place of light and shade, Wherein soft rains fell slowly, and became Clouds among sister clouds, where fair spent beams And dying glories of the sun would dwell— Why have they whom I know not, nor may know, Strange hands, unseen and ruthless, fashioned me, And borne me from the silent shadowy hills, Hither, to noise and glow of alien life, To harsh and clamorous swords, and sound of war? One speaks unto me words that would be sweet, Made harsh, made keen with love that knows me not; And some strange force, within me or around, Makes answer, kiss for kiss, and sigh for sigh, And somewhere there is fever in the halls, That troubles me, for no such trouble came To vex the cool far hollows of the hills. The foolish folk crowd round me, and they cry, That house, and wife, and lands, and all Troy town, Are little to lose, if they may keep me here, And see me flit, a pale and silent shade, Among the streets bereft, and helpless shrines. At other hours another life seems mine, Where one great river runs unswollen of rain, By pyramids of unremembered kings, And homes of men obedient to the dead. There dark and quiet faces come and go Around me, then again the shriek of arms, And all the turmoil of the Ilian men. What are they? even shadows such as I. What make they? Even this—the sport of gods— The sport of gods, however free they seem. Ah, would the game were ended, and the light, The blinding light, and all too mighty suns, Withdrawn, and I once more with sister shades, Unloved, forgotten, mingled with the mist, Dwelt in the hollows of the shadowy hills. Love and Wisdom ‘When last we gathered roses in the garden I found my wits, but truly you lost yours.’ The Broken Heart. July and June brought flowers and love To you, but I would none thereof, Whose heart kept all through summer time A flower of frost and winter rime. Yours was true wisdom—was it not?— Even love; but I had clean forgot, Till seasons of the falling leaf, All loves, but one that turned to grief. At length at touch of autumn tide, When roses fell, and summer died, All in a dawning deep with dew, Love flew to me—love fled from you. The roses drooped their weary heads, I spoke among the garden beds; You would not hear, you could not know, Summer and love seemed long ago, As far, as faint, as dim a dream, As to the dead this world may seem. Ah sweet, in winter's miseries, Perchance you may remember this, How wisdom was not justified In summer time or autumn-tide, Though for this once below the sun, Wisdom and love were made at one; But love was bitter-bought enough, And wisdom light of wing as love. Good-bye Kiss me, and say good-bye; Good-bye—there is no word to say but this, Nor any lips left for my lips to kiss, Nor any tears to shed, when these tears dry; Kiss me, and say good-bye. Farewell! be glad—forget; There is no need to say ‘forget’, I know, For youth is youth, and time will have it so; And though your lips are pale, and your eyes wet, Farewell, you must forget. You shall bring home your sheaves, Many, and heavy, and with blossoms twined Of memories that go not out of mind; Let this one sheaf be twined with poppy leaves When you bring home your sheaves. In garnered loves of thine— The ripe good fruit of many hearts and years— Somewhere let this lie, gray and salt with tears; It grew too near the sea wind and the brine Of life, this love of mine. This sheaf was spoiled in spring, And over-long was green, and early sere, And never gathered gold in the late year From autumn suns, and moons of harvesting, But failed in frosts of spring. Yet was it thine, my sweet, This love, though weak as young corn witherèd Whereof no man may gather and make bread; Thine, though it never knew the summer heat; Forget not quite, my sweet. Christmas Violets Last night I found the violets You sent me once across the sea; From gardens that the winter frets In summer lands they came to me. Still fragrant of the English earth, Still humid from the frozen dew, To me they spoke of Christmas mirth, They spoke of England—spoke of you. But you have reached a windless age, The haven of a happy clime; You do not dread the winter's rage, Although we missed the summer time. And like the flower's breath over sea, Across the gulf of time and pain, To-night returns the memory Of castles that we built—in Spain! The Nemesis of Art (Written after reading The Tinted Venus, by Mr. Anstey.) I Alas! that thou art dear, and not so dear, As faces fading from the painted wall, The queens of ages immemorial, Helen, and grace of golden Guinevere! Alas! thy kisses are not worth a tear, One single tear of all the tears that fall For memory of loves gone out of call, And these old voices that we shall not hear. Alas! that thou art fair, and not so fair, As ladies Lionardo loved to paint, Set in a frame of curled and golden hair, Saintlike; with smiles that are not of a saint, Glad with inexplicable mirth, or faint With extreme languor and supreme despair. II We love like him who gave, long time ago, To Venus' marble hand his wedding ring; No more his love's embrace might round him cling, Nor heart with heart responsive ebb and flow; Only the goddess-ghost would come and go, To fan him with the breath of her white wing, And dull the fever, and assuage the sting, And comfort him a little in his woe. And we, like him, have given our hearts away To beauty that was never clad in clay, That puts all mortal loveliness to scorn; A pale, a bitter, and a jealous queen, With her undying beauty set between Our loves and us, to make us all forlorn. Legion Oh, it's billy and swag, and it's do and dare In the mining camp, in the good free air, We do golden deeds by the batch! For we won the Cup on a nobbled mare (Oh, it's billy and swag and it's do and dare!) And we pulled off the English match! And we hunted the Boer as you hunt a hare, And we brought off a gallery catch! And you'll find the Cornstalks everywhere, In the mining camp, in the good free air; They are first on the flat, they are all on the square, Their lads are as brave as their lasses are fair, And you'll find the Australians everywhere, Oh, it's billy and swag, and it's do and dare, From the turf to the last dispatch! And it's boot and saddle and devil may care, It's ‘won by a hand and a little to spare’, And the handicap landed from scratch! Sylvie et Aurélie In Memory of Gérard de Nerval Two loves there were, and one was born Between the sunset and the rain; Her singing voice went through the corn, Her dance was woven 'neath the thorn, On grass the fallen blossoms stain; And suns may set, and moons may wane, But this love comes no more again. There were two loves and one made white Thy singing lips, and golden hair; Born of the city's mire and light, The shame and splendour of the night, She trapped and fled thee unaware; Not through the lamplight and the rain Shalt thou behold this love again. Go forth and seek, by wood and hill, Thine ancient love of dawn and dew; There comes no voice from mere or rill, Her dance is over, fallen still The ballad burdens that she knew; And thou must wait for her in vain, Till years bring back thy youth again. That other love, afield, afar Fled the light love, with lighter feet. Nay, though thou seek where gravesteads are, And flit in dreams from star to star, That dead love shalt thou never meet, Till through bleak dawn and blowing rain Thy soul shall find her soul again. The Tournay of the Heroes Ho, warders, cry a tournay! ho, heralds, call the knights! What gallant lance for old romance 'gainst modern fiction fights? The lists are set, the knights are met, I ween, a dread array, St. Chad to shield, a stricken field shall we behold to-day! First to the northern barriers pricks Roland of Roncesvaux, And by his side, in knightly pride, Wilfred of Ivanhoe, The Templar rideth by his rein, two gallant foes were they; And proud to see, le brave Bussy his colours doth display. Ready at need he comes with speed, William of Deloraine, And Hereward the Wake himself is pricking o'er the plain. The good knight of La Mancha's here; here is Sir Amyas Leigh, And Eric of the gold hair, pride of northern chivalry. There shines the steel of Alan Breck, the sword of Athos shines, Dalgetty on Gustavus rides along the marshalled lines; With many a knight of sunny France the Cid has marched from Spain, And Götz the lron-handed leads the lances of Almain. But who upon the modern side are champions? With the sleeve Adorned of his false lady-love, rides glorious David Grieve; A bookseller sometime was he, in a provincial town, But now before his iron mace go horse and rider down. Ho, Robert Elsmere! count thy beads; lo, champion of the fray, With brandished colt, comes Felix Holt, all of the modern day. And Silas Lapham's six-shooter is cocked: the colonel's spry! There spurs the wary Egoist, defiance in his eye; There Zola's ragged regiment comes, with dynamite in hand, And Flaubert's crew of country doctors devastate the land. On Robert Elsmere Friar Tuck falls with his quarter-staff, Nom Dé! to see the clerics fight might make the sourest laugh! They meet—they shock—full many a knight is smitten on the crown; So keep us good St. Geneviève, Umslopogaas is down! About the mace of David Grieve his blood is flowing red, Alas for ancient chivalry, le brave Bussy is sped! Yet where the sombre Templar rides the modern caitiffs fly, The Mummer (of The Mummer's Wife) has got it in the eye; From Felix Holt his patent colt hath not averted fate, And Silas Lapham's smitten fair, right through his gallant pate. There Dan Deronda reels and falls, a hero sore surprised; Ha, Beauséant! still may such fate befall the Circumcised! The Egoist is flying fast from him of lvanhoe: Beneath the axe of Skalagrim fall prigs at every blow: The ragged Zolaists have fled, screaming ‘We are betrayed’, But loyal Alan Breck is shent, stabbed through the Stuart plaid. In sooth it is a grimly sight, so fast the heroes fall, Three volumes fell could scarcely tell the fortunes of them all. At length but two are left on ground, and David Grieve is one. Ma foy, what deeds of derring-do that bookseller hath done! The other, mark the giant frame, the great portentous fist! 'Tis Porthos! David Grieve may call on Kuenen an he list. The swords are crossed; Doublez, dégagez, vite! great Porthos calls, And David drops, that secret botte hath pierced his overalls; And goodly Porthos, as of old the famed Orthryades, Raises the trophy of the fight; then, falling on his knees, He writes in gore upon his shield, ‘Romance, Romance, has won!’ And blood-red on that stricken field goes down the angry sun. Night falls upon the field of death, night on the darkling lea: Oh send us such a tournay soon, and send me there to see! Gallia Lady, lady neat Of the roguish eye, Wherefore dost thou hie Stealthy, down the street, On well-booted feet? From French novels I Gather that you fly, Guy or Jules to meet. Furtive dost thou range, Oft thy cab dost change; So, at least, 'tis said; Oh, the sad old tale Passionately stale, We've so often read. The Fairy Minister The Rev. Mr. Kirk of Aberfoyle was carried away by the Fairies in 1692. People of Peace! a peaceful man, Well worthy of your love was he, Who, while the roaring Garry ran Red with the life-blood of Dundee, While coats were turning, crowns were falling, Wandered along his valley still, And heard your mystic voices calling From fairy knowe and haunted hill. He heard, he saw, he knew too well The secrets of your fairy clan; You stole him from the haunted dell, Who never more was seen of man. Now far from heaven, and safe from hell, Unknown of earth, he wanders free. Would that he might return and tell Of his mysterious company! For we have tired the Folk of Peace; No more they tax our corn and oil; Their dances on the moorland cease, The brownie stints his wonted toil. No more shall any shepherd meet The ladies of the fairy clan, Nor are their deathly kisses sweet On lips of any earthly man. And half I envy him who now, Clothed in her court's enchanted green, By moonlit loch or mountain's brow Is chaplain to the Fairy Queen. To Correspondents My postman, though I fear thy tread, And tremble as thy foot draws nearer, 'Tis not the Christmas dun I dread, My mortal foe is much severer— The unknown correspondent, who, With indefatigable pen, And nothing in the world to do, Perplexes literary men. From Pentecost and Ponder's End They write: from Deal, and from Dacota; The people of the Shetlands send No inconsiderable quota; They write for autographs; in vain— In vain does Phyllis write, and Flora; They write that Allan Quatermain Is not at all the book for Brora. They write to say that they have met This writer ‘at a garden party, And though’ this writer ‘may forget’ Their recollection's keen and hearty; ‘And will you praise in your reviews A novel by our distant cousin.’ These letters from provincial blues Assail us daily by the dozen. O friends with time upon your hands, O friends with postage-stamps in plenty, O poets out of many lands, O youths and maidens under twenty, Seek out some other wretch to bore, Or wreak yourselves upon your neighbours, And leave me to my dusty lore And my unprofitable labours! Partant pour la Scribie [Scribie, on the north-east littoral of Bohemia, is the land of stage conventions. It is named after the discoverer, M. Scribe.] A pleasant land is Scribie, where The light comes mostly from below, And seems a sort of symbol rare Of things at large, and how they go, In rooms where doors are everywhere And cupboards shelter friend or foe. There is a realm where people tell Each other, when they chance to meet, Of things that long ago befell— And do most solemnly repeat Secrets they both know very well, Aloud, and in the public street! A land where lovers go in fours, Master and mistress, man and maid; Where people listen at the doors Or 'neath a table's friendly shade, And comic Irishmen in scores Roam o'er the scenes all undismayed: A land where virtue in distress Owes much to uncles in disguise; Where British sailors frankly bless Their limbs, their timbers, and their eyes: And where the villain doth confess, Conveniently, before he dies! A land of lovers false and gay; A land where people dread a ‘curse’; A land of letters gone astray, Or intercepted, which is worse; Where weddings false fond maids betray, And all the babes are changed at nurse. Oh, happy land, where things come right! We of the world where things go ill; Where lovers love, but don't unite; Where no one finds the missing will— Dominion of the heart's delight, Scribie, we've loved, and love thee still! The Fairy's Gift ‘Take short views.’—Sydney Smith. The fays that to my christ'ning came (For come they did, my nurses taught me, They did not bring me wealth or fame— 'Tis very little that they brought me. But one, the crossest of the crew, The ugly old one, uninvited, Said, ‘I shall be avenged on you, My child; you shall grow up short-sighted!’ With magic juices did she lave Mine eyes, and wrought her wicked pleasure. Well, of all gifts the fairies gave, Hers is the present that I treasure! The bore whom others fear and flee, I do not fear—I do not flee him; I pass him calm as calm can be; I do not cut—I do not see him! And with my feeble eyes and dim, Where you see patchy fields and fences, For me the mists of Turner swim— My ‘azure distance’ soon commences! Nay, as I blink about the streets Of this befogged and miry city, Why, almost every girl one meets Seems preternaturally pretty! ‘Try spectacles,’ one's friends intone; ‘You'll see the world correctly through them.’ But I have visions of my own, And not for worlds would I undo them. Villanelle To Lucia Apollo left the golden Muse And shepherded a mortal's sheep, Theocritus of Syracuse! To mock the giant swain that woos The sea-nymph in the sunny deep, Apollo left the golden Muse. Afield he drove his lambs and ewes Where Milon and where Battus reap, Theocritus of Syracuse! To watch thy tunny-fishers cruise Below the dim Sicilian steep Apollo left the golden Muse. Ye twain did loiter in the dews, Ye slept the swain's unfever'd sleep, Theocritus of Syracuse! That time might half with his confuse Thy songs—like his, that laugh and leap— Theocritus of Syracuse, Apollo left the golden Muse! Woman and the Weed Founded on a New Zealand Myth In the morning of time, when his fortunes began, How bleak, how un-Greek, was the nature of man! From his wigwam, if ever he ventured to roam, There was nobody waiting to welcome him home; For the man had been made, but the woman had not, And earth was a highly detestable spot. Man hated his neighbours; they met and they scowled, They did not converse but they struggled and howled, For man had no tact—he would ne'er take a hint, And his notions he backed with a hatchet of flint. So man was alone, and he wished he could see On the earth some one like him, but fairer than he, With locks like the red gold, a smile like the sun, To welcome him back when his hunting was done. And he sighed for a voice that should answer him still, Like the affable echo he heard on the hill: That should answer him softly and always agree, And oh, man reflected, how nice it would be! So he prayed to the gods, and they stooped to his prayer, And they spoke to the sun on his way through the air, And he married the echo one fortunate morn, And woman, their beautiful daughter, was born! The daughter of sunshine and echo she came With a voice like a song, with a face like a flame; With a face like a flame, and a voice like a song, And happy was man, but it was not for long! For weather's a painfully changeable thing, Not always the child of the echo would sing; And the face of the sun may be hidden with mist, And his child can be terribly cross if she list; And unfortunate man had to learn with surprise That a frown's not peculiar to masculine eyes; That the sweetest of voices can scold and can sneer, And cannot be answered—like men—with a spear. So man went and called to the gods in his woe, And they answered him—‘Sir, you would needs have it so: And the thing must go on as the thing has begun, She's immortal—your child of the echo and sun. But we'll send you another, and fairer is she, This maiden with locks that are flowing and free. This maiden so gentle, so kind, and so fair, With a flower like a star in the night of her hair. With her eyes like the smoke that is misty and blue, With her heart that is heavenly, tender, and true. She will die in the night, but no need you should mourn, You shall bury her body and thence shall be born A weed that is green, that is fragrant and fair, With a flower like the star in the night of her hair. And the leaves must ye burn till they offer to you Soft smoke, like her eyes that are misty and blue. ‘And the smoke shall ye breathe and no more shall ye fret, But the child of the echo and sun shall forget— Shall forget all the trouble and torment she brings, Shall bethink ye of none but delectable things; And the sound of the wars with your brethren shall cease, While ye smoke by the camp-fire the great pipe of peace.’ So the last state of man was by no means the worst, The second gift softened the sting of the first. Nor the child of the echo and sun doth he heed When he dreams with the maid that was changed to the weed; Though the echo be silent, the sun in a mist, The maid is the fairest that ever was kissed; And when tempests are over and ended the rain, And the child of the sunshine is sunny again He comes back, glad at heart, and again is at one With the changeable child of the echo and sun. Another Way Come to me in my dreams, and then, One saith, I shall be well again, For then the night will more than pay The hopeless longing of the day. Nay, come not thou in dreams, my sweet! With shadowy robes, and silent feet, And with the voice, and with the eyes That greet me in a soft surprise. Last night, last night, in dreams we met, And how, to-day, shall I forget? Or how, remembering, restrain Mine incommunicable pain? Nay, where thy land and people are, Dwell thou remote, apart, afar, Nor mingle with the shapes that sweep The melancholy ways of sleep. But if, perchance, the shadows break— If dreams depart, if men awake, If face to face at length we see, Be thine the voice to welcome me. Valé Once the Muse was fair, Once—when we were young; Gay and debonair, Or with pensive air; So she came, she sung. Often, through the noise Of the running stream, Would we hear her voice— Hear it and rejoice; ‘Dream not 'twas a dream.’ Could we see her now Come at a command, Withered on her brow Were the wreath—the bough Broken in her hand. Nay, as erst the morn Floating far away, More in ruth than scorn Left her love outworn, Once his locks were gray. So, for ever young, Ever fair, the Muse Leaves us, who have sung Till the lute's unstrung; Doth her grace refuse. 'Tis not she, but we, That are weary now; Well, howe'er it be, Her we shall not see— Broken is the bough. To Fiona From the damp shieling on the draggled island Mountains divide you, and no end of seas. But, though your heart is genuinely Highland, Still, you're in luck to be away from these! Far from the mountains where the thirsty crofter Early and eager registers his vote, Still drinking harder as the day grows ‘softer’, Fiona, from these thou art happily remote. Far from the hostels where the baffled tripper Watches the window and contemplates the rain; Far from the drenched decks where the oilskinned skipper Herds the unhappy clients of Macbrayne. The steamers of David Macbrayne would provide readiest access to the Western Isles during the tourist season. Far from the caves where unfortunate Prince Charlie Served as the pasture of the eager midge, Fiona, methinks that, after dining early, Thou art enjoying the delights of bridge. Yes, Fiona dear, the Highlands, from a distance, Seem a seductive subject for a lay, But, when it rains with the usual persistence, Fiona, perhaps you would rather stop away. Lines on the Inaugural meeting of The Shelley Society ‘By Jove, I will; he was my father's friend!’ Thus Dr. Furnivall, in choice blank verse, Replied when he was asked by Mr. Sweet (Sweet of the pointed and envenomed pen, Wherewith he pricks the men who not elect Him a Professor, as he ought to be), 'Twas thus, we say, that Furnivall replied To the bold question asked by bitter Sweet. ‘And what that question?’ Briefly, it was this— ‘Why do not you, who start so many things, Societies for poets live and dead, Why do not you a new communion found— “Shelley Society” might be the name— Where men might worry over Shelley's bones?’ ‘By Jove, I will; he was my father's friend,’ Said Furnivall; and lo, the thing was done! Then the fresh victim to ‘inaugurate’, They called upon the Reverend Stopford Brooke. Who, being well disposed to them, arose, And did address them in majestic phrase, ‘Forewords’, as they are styled by Furnivall, By Jove, for Shelley was his father's friend. ‘A thoughtful and most temperate address’ Was Stopford Brooke's, who, as we learn with grief From the reporter of this merry fit, ‘Knocked Mr. Matthew Arnold out of time’. Oh, somewhere, meek, unconscious Matt, that sit'st Below Teutonic limes, somewhere thou'lt read I' the Times, how Stopford Brooke has knocked thee flat! Then, to the joy of the assembled host, To them arose intrepid Furnivall (Young Mr. Shelley was his father's friend), And proved that Matthew is a Philistine! Oh, tell it not in Gath; oh, tell it not Where men do congregate in Ascalon, That Mr. Arnold tarries in their tents Disguised, and worships Dagon e'en as they. Such is the view of Dr. Furnivall. Then anecdotes of Shelley were brought forth— Old anecdotes, and such as Captain Sumph Was wont to tell of Byron and the priest Who grieved that he was ‘not a family man’. This was the bravest of the anecdotes, How Shelley at the elder Furnivall's (For Shelley was the Doctor's father's friend) Was asked one day, at tea, ‘What he would take’? And what took Shelley but a dish of milk (It seems he did not like it in a cup)— A dish of milk, and, butterless, a crust. Such was the food of this superior mind, Such the tradition and the influence That shaped the soul of Dr. Furnivall. What more? Why not so much as we might hope; But Mr. Brooke—the Reverend Stopford Brooke, He who in our religion finds romance— Declared that Shelley was the poet-priest Of what he calls ‘the modern Meliorism’. What that may be we know not; but 'tis thought To be a kind of pious Socialism, To be a dallying with dynamite, With Mr. Hyndman and the other gents Who lead a mob along the streets and break The windows, and who scare the little girls. Then these weird figures went their several ways, All the Society of Shelleyites. Much have they added to the public stock Of information about Shelley's ways; Much, very much, it helps us to enjoy The Adonais and Alastor, too, Prometheus and Epipsychidion. Oh, happy Shelley! happy in thy friends, And happy in the culminating chance When Mr. Sweet inquired of Furnivall Why he should so neglect so great a bard, For Shelley was the Doctor's father's friend. A New Shakespere RICHARD III ACT I. SCENE I London: a Street. Enter Gloster (reading The Historical Review) Gloster. I am a very personable man, And did not cut my teeth ere I was born, Still less may be described as ‘half made up’. My humpback is a myth: mine evil deeds Were falsehoods of Archbishop Morton coined, Paid for by Richmond, put in currency By that detested caitiff, Thomas More. Enter Clarence. Gloster. Brother, good day! Thou canst not say I did it! Clarence. There is a certain buzzing in my wits: The new historians distract my mind, Yet was I Clarence once, and bore a brain. Gloster (aside). Wiser, perchance, if thou hadst brained a Boar! But, hist! I am a moral character. I ask thee, who was guilty? Clarence. I know not, but— Gloster. But me no buts! That butt of Malmsey wine Is an exploded fable. Clarence. Certainly. Yet, somehow, I was foully done to death Unhouseled, unanointed, unannealed. Gloster. 'Twas Richmond, 'twas false, fleeting, perjured Richmond! [Exit Clarence. SCENE II. The Same. To Gloster enter The Corpse of Henry VI and Lady Anne. Lady Anne. Rest you while I lament my Henry's corpse, While I adore my Henry's holy shade! Gloster. I did not kill your husband; on the day Of our late king's deplorable demise I was not in the Tower—was out of town: At Sandwich—Mr. Clements Markham proves— Was I: perchance pursued the devious ball, And in the Maiden bunker came to grief. Or if not so, I know not what I did, Or what foul fiend could take a man to Sandwich. Lady Anne. Never hung poison on a fouler toad! Gloster. Nay, hear me swear a good mouth-filling oath That I can prove a perfect alibi. Listen, from this ‘Historical Review’, Put forth by Master Longman, in the Row, I'll prove me sackless of that monstrous deed! Lady Anne. A monstrous deal of sack! Gloster. Nay, mock me not! For Mr. Clements Markham makes it plain That on the fatal day I was afar From Towers of Julius, London's lasting shame. 'Tis true that Mr. Samuel Gardiner Has put the matter in another light: A question 'tis of dates, but what are they? Myself am strong on Clements Markham's side; (aside) Yet Mrs. Markham tells another tale! Lady Anne. ‘Samivel, a halibi.’ This likes me well! Gloster. Then, then we may consider ourselves engaged? Lady Anne. Perdition catch my soul, but I do love thee! [Exit Lady Anne and Corpse. SCENE III. To Gloster enter King Edward, led in sick (sic). King Edward. Alas! 'twas aye my lamentable custom To make the cold-baked meats to furnish forth The wedding breakfast! Widows were my bane. Still fast on one, I wooed another widow, And all the while was wedded to another. None knew but the archbishop: thus my sons, These thrice unhappy children in the Tower, Are, to speak plainly, illegitimate. Thou wilt not slay them, Gloster? Gloster. Fear me not! My title, the ‘Historical Review’ Assures me, is writ plain: there is no need That I should smother children in the Tower. 'Twas Richmond did it! Mr. Clements Markham, In spite of the Croyland Continuator, Has made this view extremely plausible, (aside) But Mrs. Markham tells another tale! King Edward. Bless thee: but I feel poorly and would go. [King Edward is led out sick. SCENE IV. To Gloster enter Hastings. Hastings. Come, lead me to the block! 'Tis falsely said That, ere he tried me, Richard had my head! Gloster. Exactly! The ‘Historical Review’ And Mr. Clements Markham vouch for it. Thou, Hastings, hadst due trial of thy peers; And so, farewell, a plunger wert thou ever, Yet could I better spare a better man! [Hastings is led to the block. SCENE V. To Gloster enter Dighton and Forrest. Dighton. It is a very palpable relief To learn, my Forrest, that we never smothered (At all events, not in King Richard's time), The most replenished, sweet work of nature, These everlasting babes within the Tower! Forrest. Nay; it was Henry VII who bade us smother! Gloster. What! wed a Princess and work off her brother! [Exeunt Dighton and Forrest. SCENE VI. To Gloster enter Ghosts. Ghost of Prince Edward. Let me not sit upon thy soul to-morrow. I do misdoubt me 'twas another's hand That stabbed me in the field by Tewkesbury! Ghost of Henry VI. When I was mortal, my anointed body By some one was punched full of deadly holes; But who that puncher is who punched with care Is, bless us all! a very different thing. Ghosts of Rivers, Vaughan, Grey, and a Number of Other Ghosts. We come to offer our apologies, And to regret that we were much misled By rumour, painted full of fiery tongues. 'Tis true there was a lot of killing done, And massacre made merry round the throne; But liars were the Tudor chroniclers, Especially the lewd Archbishop Morton. Gloster. It was not I who did the thing ye wot of? Ghosts. Apparently it was not! Fare ye well! [Exeunt Ghosts. Gloster. Richard's himself again! Now to the field! A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse! For there's no way of getting over it, That, after doing prodigies of valour, Myself was foully slain on Bosworth Field, Unless, indeed, 'tis I was Perkin Warbeck! A view not broached by Mr. Clements Markham, Yet tenable, at least, in magazines, And among modern speculations. A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse! [Exit fighting. Curtain. Ronsard's Grave Ye wells, ye founts that fall From the steep mountain wall; That fall, and flash, and fleet With silver feet! Ye woods, ye streams that lave The meadows with your wave, Ye hills, and valleys fair, Attend my prayer! When heaven and fate decree My latest hour for me; When I must pass away From pleasant day, I ask that none may break The marble for my sake, Wishful to make more fair My sepulchre. Only a laurel tree Shall shade the grave of me; Only Apollo's bough Shall guard me now! Now shall I be at rest Among the spirits blest, The happy dead that dwell— Where—who may tell? The snow and wind and hail May never there prevail, Nor ever thunder fall, Nor storm at all; But always fadeless there The woods are green and fair, And faithful ever more Spring to that shore! There shall I ever hear Alcaeus' music clear; And—sweetest of all things— There Sappho sings. The Barbarous Bird-gods: A Savage Parabasis In the Aves of Aristophanes, the Bird Chorus declare that they are older than the gods, and greater benefactors of men. This idea recurs in almost all savage mythologies, and I have made the savage Bird-gods state their own case. The birds sing We would have you to wit, that on eggs though we sit, and are spiked on the spit, and are baked in the pan, Birds are older by far than your ancestors are, and made love and made war ere the making of man! For when all things were dark, not a glimmer nor spark, and the world like a barque without rudder or sail Floated on through the night, 'twas a bird struck a light, 'twas a flash from the bright feather'd Tonatiu's Tonatiu, the Thunder Bird; well known to the Dacotas and Zulus. tail! Then the hawk The hawk, in the myth of the Galinameros of Central California, lit up the sun. with some dry wood flew up in the sky, and afar, safe and high, the hawk lit sun and moon, And the birds of the air they rejoiced everywhere, and they recked not of care that should come on them soon. For the hawk, so they tell, was then known as Pundjel, Pundjel, the eagle hawk, is the demiurge and ‘culture-hero’ of several Australian tribes. and a-musing he fell at the close of the day; Then he went on the quest, as we thought, of a nest, with some bark of the best, and a clawful of clay. The creation of man is thus described by the Australians. And with these did he frame two birds lacking a name, without feathers (his game was a puzzle to all); Next around them he fluttered a-dancing, and muttered; and, lastly, he uttered a magical call: Then the figures of clay, as they featherless lay, they leaped up, who but they, and embracing they fell; And this was the baking of man, and his making; but now he's forsaking his father, Pundjel! Now these creatures of mire, they kept whining for fire, and to crown their desire who was found but the wren? To the high heaven he came, from the sun stole he flame, and for this has a name in the memory of men! In Andaman, Thlinkeet, Melanesian, and other myths, a bird is the Prometheus Purphorus; in Normandy this part is played by the wren. And in India who for the soma juice flew, and to men brought it through without falter or fail? Why the hawk 'twas again, and great Indra to men would appear, now and then, in the shape of a quail, While the Thlinkeets' delight is the bird of the night, the beak and the bright ebon plumage of Yehl. Yehl: the raven god of the Thlinkeets. And who for man's need brought the famed Suttung's mead? why 'tis told in the creed of the Sagamen strong, 'Twas the eagle-god who brought the drink from the blue, and gave mortals the brew that's the fountain of song. Indra stole soma as a hawk and as a quail. For Odin's feat as a bird, see Bragi's Telling in the Younger Edda. Next, who gave men their laws? Pundjel, the eagle hawk, gave Australians their marriage laws. and what reason or cause the young brave overawes when in need of a squaw, Till he thinks it a shame to wed one of his name, and his conduct you blame if he thus breaks the law? For you still hold it wrong if a lubra Lubra, a woman; kobong, ‘totem’; or, to please Mr. Max Müller, ‘otem’. belong to the selfsame kobong that is father of you, To take ber as a bride to your ebony side; nay, you give her a wide berth; quite right of you, too. For her father, you know, is your father, the crow, and no blessing but woe from the wedding would spring. Well, these rules they were made in the wattle-gum shade, and were strictly obeyed, when the crow was the king. The crow was the hawk's rival. Thus on earth's little ball to the birds you owe all, yet Your gratitude's small for the favours they've done, And their feathers you pill, and you eat them at will, yes, You plunder and kill the bright birds one by one; There's a price on their head, and the dodo is dead, and The moa has fled from the sight of the sun. Pisidicé The incident is from the Love Stories of Parthenius, who preserved fragments of a lost epic on the expedition of Achilles against Lesbos, an island allied with Troy. The daughter of the Lesbian king Within her bower she watched the war; Far off she heard the arrows ring, The smitten harness ring afar; And, fighting from the foremost car, Saw one that smote where all must flee; More fair than the Immortals are He seemed to fair Pisidicé! She saw—she loved him—and her heart Before Achilles, Peleus' son, Threw all its guarded gates apart, A maiden fortress lightly won! And, ere that day of fight was done, No more of land or faith recked she, But joyed in her new life begun— Her life of love, Pisidicé! She took a gift into her hand, As one that had a boon to crave; She stole across the ruined land Where lay the dead without a grave, And to Achilles' hand she gave Her gift, the secret postern's key. ‘To-morrow let me be thy slave!’ Moaned to her love Pisidicé. Ere dawn the Argives' clarion call Rang down Methymna's burning street; They slew the sleeping warriors all, They drove the women to the fleet, Save one, that to Achilles' feet Clung, but, in sudden wrath, cried he: ‘For her no doom but death is meet,’ And there men stoned Pisidicé. In havens of that haunted coast, Amid the myrtles of the shore, The moon sees many a maiden ghost— Love's outcast now and evermore. The silence hears the shades deplore Their hour of dear-bought love; but thee The waves lull, 'neath thine olives hoar, To dreamless rest, Pisidicé! Villanelle (To M. Joseph Boulmier, Author of ‘Les Villanelles’) Villanelle, why art thou mute? Hath the singer ceased to sing? Hath the Master lost his lute? Many a pipe and scrannel flute On the breeze their discords fling; Villanelle, why art thou mute? Sound of tumult and dispute, Noise of war the echoes bring; Hath the Master lost his lute? Once he sang of bud and shoot In the season of the spring; Villanelle, why art thou mute? Fading leaf and falling fruit Say, ‘The year is on the wing, Hath the Master lost his lute?’ Ere the axe lie at the root, Ere the winter come as king, Villanelle, why art thou mute? Hath the Master lost his lute? Man and the Ascidian A Morality ‘The ancestor remote of man,’ Says Darwin, ‘is th' ascidian,’ A scanty sort of water-beast That, ninety million years at least Before gorillas came to be, Went swimming up and down the sea. Their ancestors the pious praise, And like to imitate their ways; How, then, does our first parent live, What lesson has his life to give? Th' ascidian tadpole, young and gay, Doth life with one bright eye survey, His consciousness has easy play. He's sensitive to grief and pain, Has tail, and spine, and bears a brain, And everything that fits the state Of creatures we call vertebrate. But age comes on; with sudden shock He sticks his head against a rock! His tail drops off, his eye drops in, His brain's absorbed into his skin; He does not move, nor feel, nor know The tidal water's ebb and flow, But still abides, unstirred, alone, A sucker sticking to a stone. And we, his children, truly we In youth are, like the tadpole, free; And where we would we blithely go; Have brains and hearts, and feel and know. Then age comes on! To habit we Affix ourselves and are not free. Th' ascidian's rooted to a rock, And we are bond-slaves of the clock; Our rocks are medicine—letters—law, From these our heads we cannot draw: Our loves drop off, our hearts drop in, And daily thicker grows our skin. Ah, scarce we live, we scarcely know The wide world's moving ebb and flow, The clanging currents ring and shock, But we are rooted to the rock. And thus at ending of his span, Blind, deaf, and indolent, does man Revert to the ascidian. In Tintagel LUI. Ah lady, lady, leave the creeping mist, And leave the iron castle by the sea! ELLE. Nay, from the sea there came a ghost that kissed My lips, and so I cannot come to thee! LUI. Ah lady, leave the cruel landward wind That crusts the blighted flowers with bitter foam! ELLE. Nay, for his arms are cold and strong to bind, And I must dwell with him and make my home! LUI. Come, for the spring is fair in Joyous Guard, And down deep alleys sweet birds sing again. ELLE. But I must tarry with the winter hard, And with the bitter memory of pain, Although the spring be fair in Joyous Guard, And in the gardens glad birds sing again! Romance My Love dwelt in a northern land. A gray tower in a forest green Was hers, and far on either hand The long wash of the waves was seen, And leagues on leagues of yellow sand, The woven forest boughs between! And through the silver northern night The sunset slowly died away, And herds of strange deer, lily-white, Stole forth among the branches gray; About the coming of the light, They fled like ghosts before the day! I know not if the forest green Still girdles round that castle gray; I know not if the boughs between The white deer vanish ere the day: Above my love the grass is green My heart is colder than the clay! ‘A Highly Valuable Chain of Thoughts.’ Had cigarettes no ashes, And roses ne'er a thorn, No man would be a funker Of whin, or burn, or bunker. There were no need for mashies, The turf would ne'er be torn, Had cigarettes no ashes, And roses ne'er a thorn. Had cigarettes no ashes, And roses ne'er a thorn, The big trout would not ever Escape into the river. No gut the salmon smashes Would leave us all forlorn, Had cigarettes no ashes, And roses ne'er a thorn. But 'tis an unideal Sad world in which we're born, And things will ‘go contrairy’ With Martin and with Mary: And every day the real Comes bleakly in with morn, And cigarettes have ashes, And every rose a thorn. Love the Vampire ? ?????? ? ??? ????. The level sands and gray, Stretch leagues and leagues away, Down to the border line of sky and foam; A spark of sunset burns, The gray tide-water turns, Back, like a ghost from her forbidden home! Here, without pyre or bier, Light Love was buried here; Alas, his grave was wide and deep enough. Thrice, with averted head, We cast dust on the dead, And left him to his rest. An end of Love. ‘No stone to roll away, No seal of snow or clay, Only soft dust above his wearied eyes; But though the sudden sound Of doom should shake the ground, And graves give up their ghosts, he will not rise! So each to each we said! Ah, but to either bed Set far apart in lands of north and south, Love as a vampire came With haggard eyes aflame, And kissed us with the kisses of his mouth! Thenceforth in dreams must we Each other's shadow see Wand'ring unsatisfied in empty lands; Still the desirèd face Fleets from the vain embrace, And still the shape evades the longing hands. The Last Maying ‘It is told of the last lovers which watched May-night in the forest, before men brought the tidings of the Gospel to this land, that they beheld no fairies, nor dwarfs, nor no such thing, but the very Venus herself, who bade them “make such cheer as they might, for”, said she, “I shall live no more in these woods, nor shall ye endure to see another May time.”’—Edmund Gorliot, ‘Of Phantasies and Omens,’ p. 149. (1573.) ‘Whence do ye come, with the dew on your hair? From what far land are the boughs ye bear— The blossoms and buds upon breasts and tresses— The light burned white in your faces fair?’ ‘In a falling fane have we built our house, With the dying gods we have held carouse, And our lips are wan from their wild caresses, Our hands are filled with their holy boughs. ‘As we crossed the lawn in the dying day No fairy led us to meet the May, But the very goddess loved by lovers, In mourning raiment of green and gray. ‘She was not decked as for glee and game, She was not veiled with the veil of flame— The saffron veil of the bride that covers The face that is flushed with her joy and shame. ‘On the laden branches the scent and dew Mingled and met, and as snow to strew The woodland rides and the fragrant grasses, White flowers fell as the night wind blew. ‘Tears and kisses on lips and eyes Mingled and met amid laughter and sighs For grief that abides, and joy that passes, For pain that tarries and mirth that flies. ‘It chanced as the dawning grew to gray Pale and sad on our homeward way, With weary lips, and palled with pleasure The goddess met us, farewell to say.’ ‘Ye have made your choice, and the better part. Ye chose,’ she said, ‘and the wiser art; In the wild May night drank all the measure, The perfect pleasure of heart and heart. ‘Ye shall walk no more with the May,’ she said, ‘Shall your love endure though the gods be dead? Shall the flitting flocks, mine own, my chosen, Sing as of old, and be happy and wed? ‘Yea, they are glad as of old; but you, Fair and fleet as the dawn or the dew, Abide no more, for the springs are frozen, And fled the gods that ye loved and knew. ‘Ye shall never know summer again like this; Ye shall play no more with the fauns, I wis, No more in the nymphs' and dryads' playtime Shall echo and answer kiss and kiss. ‘Though the flowers in your golden hair be bright, Your golden hair shall be waste and white On faded brows ere another May time Bring the spring, but no more delight.’ A Jubilee Ode The Illustrated London News Beholds her jubilee: How memory brings back the views Of old she showed to me! I see the pictures from afar That pleased a child's sick-bed— The woodcuts of the Russian war, The fields we daubed with red. An unacknowledged painter, I Improved the artist's work— How very blue I made the sky, How very brown the Turk! O pictured page! O happy age! O combinations quaint! An empire's agony, the rage Of war, were things to paint! That old, disinterested art Of ours has passed away; We primitifs endure our part In the world's brawl to-day. But younger children yet may list With penny paints to mar The bombshell of the anarchist, The flames of social war. Long is the pictured chronicle Of peace, of war, or mirth; A wondrous tale the woodcuts tell Of changes on the earth. Through every land goes forth her hand— The Illustrated News; In temples of Roraima stand Framed fragments of her views. Her pictures are the people's book, Those the unlettered please; And gladly on her pages look The Zulus and Chinese. Whate'er stand fast, long may she last, Long may her works remain! On far-off fields long may she cast The fertile chaff of Payn! James Payn the novelist. A bard, who does not oft torment A somewhat faded muse These elements of ode hath sent To hymn the London News. The Fortunate Islands The Fortunate Islands. This piece is a rhymed loose version of a passage in the Vera Historia of Lucian. The humorist was unable to resist the temptation to introduce passages of mockery, which are here omitted. Part of his description of the Isles of the Blest has a close and singular resemblance to the New Jerusalem of the Apocalypse. The clear River of Life and the prodigality of gold and of precious stones may especially be noticed. A Dream in June In twilight of the longest day I lingered over Lucian, Till ere the dawn a dreamy way My spirit found, untrod of man, Between the green sky and the gray. Amid the soft dusk suddenly, More light than air I seemed to sail Afloat upon the ocean sky; While through the faint blue, clear and pale, I saw the mountain clouds go by: My barque had thought for helm and sail, And one mist wreath for canopy. Like torches on a marble floor Reflected, so the wild stars shone Within the abysmal hyaline; Till the day widened more and more, And sank to sunset, and was gone; And then, as burning beacons shine On summits of a mountain isle, A light to folk on sea that fare; So the sky's beacons for a while Burned in these islands of the air. Then from a starry island set Where one swift tide of wind there flows, Came scent of lily and violet, Narcissus, hyacinth, and rose, Laurel, and myrtle buds, and vine— So delicate is the air and fine: And forests of all fragrant trees Sloped seaward from the central hill, And ever clamorous were these With singing of glad birds; and still Such music came as in the woods Most lonely, consecrate to Pan, The wind makes, in his many moods, Upon the pipes some shepherd man, Hangs up, in thanks for victory! On these shall mortals play no more, But the wind doth touch them, over and o'er, And the wind's breath in the reeds will sigh. Between the daylight and the dark That island lies in silver air; And suddenly my magic barque Wheeled, and ran in and grounded there; And by me stood the sentinel Of them who in the island dwell. All smiling did he bind my hands, With rushes green and rosy bands; They have no harsher bonds than these, The people of the pleasant lands Within the wash of the airy seas! Then was I to their city led: Now all of ivory and gold The great walls were that garlanded The temples in their shining fold— Each fane of beryl built, and each Girt with its grove of shadowy beech; And all about the town, and through, There flowed a river fed with dew, As sweet as roses, and as clear As mountain crystals pure and cold; And with his waves that water kissed The gleaming altars of amethyst That smoke with victims all the year, And sacred are to the gods of old. There sat three judges by the gate, And I was led before the Three; And they but looked on me, and straight The rosy bonds fell down from me Who, being innocent, was free; And I might wander at my will About that city on the hill, Among the happy people clad In purple weeds of woven air, Hued like the webs that twilight weaves At shut of languid summer eves; So light their raiment seemed; and glad Was every face I looked on there! There was no heavy heat—no cold— The dwellers there wax never old, Nor wither with the waning time; But each man keeps that age he had When first he won the fairy clime. The night falls never from on high, Nor ever burns the heat of noon; But such soft light eternally Shines, as in silver dawns of June Before the sun hath climbed the sky! Within these pleasant streets and wide, The souls of heroes go and come, Even they that fell on either side Beneath the walls of Ilium; And sunlike in that shadowy isle The face of Helen and her smile Makes glad the souls of them that knew Grief for her sake a little while! And all true Greeks and wise are there; And with his hand upon the hair Of Phaedo, saw I Socrates; About him many youths and fair, Hylas, Narcissus, and with these Him whom the quoit of Phœbus slew By fleet Eurotas, unaware! All these their mirth and pleasure made Within the plain Elysian, The fairest meadow that may be, With all green fragrant trees for shade And every scented wind to fan, And sweetest flowers to strew the lea. The soft winds are their servants fleet To fetch them every fruit at will And water from the river chill; And every bird that singeth sweet, Throstle, and merle, and nightingale Brings blossoms from the dewy vale— Lily, and rose, and asphodel— With these doth each guest twine his crown And wreathe his cup, and lay him down Beside some friend he loveth well. There with the shining souls I lay When, lo, a voice that seemed to say, In far-off haunts of memory, Whoso doth taste the dead men's bread Whoso doth taste the dead men's bread, &amp;c. This belief that the living may visit, on occasion, the dwellings of the dead, but can never return to earth if they taste the food of the departed, is expressed in myths of worldwide distribution. Because she ate the pomegranate seed, Persephone became subject to the spell of Hades. In Apuleius, Psyche, when she visits the place of souls, is advised to abstain from food. Kohl found the myth among the Ojibbeways, Mr. Codrington among the Solomon Islanders; it occurs in Samoa, in the Finnish Kalewala (where Wainamoinen, in Pohjola, refrains from touching meat or drink), and the belief has left its mark on the mediaeval ballad of Thomas of Ercildoune. When he is in Fairy Land, the Fairy Queen supplies him with the bread and wine of earth, and will not suffer him to touch the fruits which grow ‘in this countrie’. See also ‘Wandering Willie’ in Redgauntlet. Shall dwell for ever with these dead; Nor ever shall his body lie Beside his friends, on the gray hill Where rains weep, and the curlews shrill And the brown water wanders by! Then did a new soul in me wake, The dead men's bread I feared to break, Their fruit I would not taste indeed Were it but a pomegranate seed. Nay, not with these I made my choice To dwell for ever and rejoice; For otherwhere the river rolls That girds the home of Christian souls, And these my whole heart seeks are found On otherwise enchanted ground. Even so I put the cup away, The vision wavered, dimmed, and broke; And, nowise sorrowing, I woke; While, gray among the ruins gray, Chill through the dwellings of the dead, The dawn crept o'er the northern sea. Then, in a moment, flushed to red, Flushed all the broken minster old, And turned the shattered stones to gold, And wakened half the world with me! [From Truthful James to Mr. Bret Harte.] William Nye's Experiment Angel's. Dear Bret Harte, I'm in tears, And the camp's in the dust, For with anguish it hears As poor William may bust, And the last of the Nyes is in danger of sleeping the sleep of the just. No revolver it was Interfered with his health; The convivial glass Did not harm him by stealth; It was nary! He fell by a scheme which he thought would accumulate wealth! For a Moqui came round To the camp—Injun Joe; And the dollars was found In his pockets to flow; For he played off some tricks with live snakes, as was reckoned a competent show. They was rattlers; a pair In his teeth he would hold, And another he'd wear Like a scarf to enfold His neck, with them dangerous critters as safe as the saint was of old. Sez William, ‘That same Is as easy as wink. I am fly to his game; For them rattlers, I think, Has had all their incisors extracted. They're harmless as suthin' to drink.’ So he betted his pile He could handle them snakes; And he tried, with a smile, And a rattler he takes, Feeling safe as they'd somehow been doctored; but bless you, that sarpent awakes! Waken snakes! and they did And they rattled like mad; For it was not a ‘kid’, But some medicine he had, Injun Joe, for persuadin' the critters; but William's bit powerful bad. So they've put him outside Of a bottle of rye, And they've set him to ride A mustang as kin shy, To keep up his poor circulation; and that's the last chance for Bill Nye. But a near thing it is, And the camp's in the dust. He's a pard as we'd miss If poor Bill was to bust— If the last of the Nyes were a-sleepin the peaceable sleep of the just. From the East to the West Returning from what other seas Dost thou renew thy murmuring, Weak tide, and hast thou aught of these To tell—the shores where float and cling My love, my hope, my memories? Say, does my lady wake to note The gold light into silver die? Or do thy waves make lullaby, While dreams of hers, like angels, float Through star-sown spaces of the sky? Ah, would such angels came to me, That dreams of mine might speak with hers; Nor wake the slumber of the sea With words as low as winds that be Awake among the gossamers! Love's Cryptogram [The author (if he can be so styled) awoke from a restless sleep, with the first stanza of the following piece in his mind. He has no memory of composing it, either awake or asleep. He had long known the (perhaps) Pythagorean fable of the bean-juice, but certainly never thought of applying it to an amorous correspondence! The remaining verses are the contribution of his Conscious Self!] Elle. ‘I cannot write, I may not write, I dare not write to thee; But look on the face of the moon by night, And my letters shalt thou see. For every letter that lovers write, By their loves on the moon is seen, If they pen their thought on the paper white, With the magic juice of the bean!’ Lui. ‘Oh, I had written this many a year, And my letters you had read; Had you only told me the spell, my dear, Ere ever we twain were wed! But I have a lady and you have a lord, And their eyes are of the green; And we dared not trust to the written word Lest our long, long love be seen.’ Elle. ‘Oh, every thought that your heart has thought, Since the world came us between, The birds of the air to my heart have brought, With no word heard or seen.’ 'Twas thus in a dream we spoke and said— Myself and my love unseen; But I woke and sighed on my weary bed For the spell of the juice of the bean. Rococo (‘My name is also named “Played Out”.’) When first we heard Rossetti sing, We twanged the melancholy lyre; We sang like this—like anything— When first we heard Rossetti sing. And all our song was faded spring, And dead delight and dark desire, When first we heard Rossetti sing, We twanged the melancholy lyre. (And this is how we twanged it)— The New Orpheus to his Eurydice Why wilt thou woo, ah strange Eurydice, A languid laurell'd Orpheus in the shades, For here is company of shadowy maids, Hero, and Helen and Psamathoë: And life is like the blossom on the tree, And never tumult of the world invades; The low light wanes and waxes—flowers and fades— And sleep is sweet, and dreams suffice for me. Go back, and seek the sunlight,' as of old The wise ghost-mother of Odysseus said; Here am I half content, and scarce a-cold, But one light fits the living, one the dead; Good-bye, be glad, forget! thou canst not hold In thy kind arms, alas! this powerless head. When first we heard Rossetti sing, We also wrote this kind of thing! The Mythologist and Psyche O butterfly of fable, flown From what strange chrysalis unknown Across the empires overthrown. Thou flittest with thy fairy wings Above the strifes of creeds and kings, Above the wrecks of mortal things. Thou in thine air of endless peace Hast seen the nations rise and cease, Egypt and India, Rome and Greece, And now hast come within the scope Of those that peep, and pry, and grope: Thou art beneath the microscope! Art fixed within a little room That looks on London's glare and gloom: Yet science cannot smirch thy bloom. But thou wilt spread thy wings on high, A floating flower 'twixt earth and sky— No man may break this butterfly! A Bric-à-Brac Lyre (Extract from an unkind review.) Yes, I bought this old lute at a ‘rummaging’ stall, Where seldom do affluent customers call, For the orderly soul it is likely to vex, The stall which is littered and laden with wrecks; Brown books that are commonly suffered to sleep, With their fancies and faiths in their binding of ‘sheep’, The sermons and songs that have slipped from the study, Odd volumes, gray pamphlets, leaves musty and muddy, Where a Buddha sits watching with orthodox grin The religious romance that so often drops in, And a Venus from Cyprus, a hideous affair, With a god of the Incas is taking the air. There's a saint from a niche (how its profile is smashed!) And an elegant cat-headed figure of Pasht, There are gems—mostly false—there's a broidered old shoe, There are fans, calumets and a Maori patu, And a Mexican idol, perhaps Coatlieu! There's a bat that was played with when Mynn was a boy, There's a racquet—unstrung—and an African toy, There's a shepherdess (Chelsea), a broken Bow cup, And a sword that was made e'er our swords doubled up; There are portraits of ladies that simper and stare, And our grandfathers' fathers accounted them fair. In brief, 'tis a very disorderly stall, And the owner's half blind, and the prices are small; And it's just three and ninepence I gave for the lute Which for many a year had been harmlessly mute. But I've strung it, and patched it, and play'd it, by times, And rhymed to the music and mused on the rhymes. It's a worm-eaten piece, and remember it must The wrecks it has dwelt with, the gods deep in dust, The bats out of service, the poems unread, The show in the streets, and the snows on my head. It is jangled, the lute, and if nobody cares For its windy old moans upon obsolete airs— For the accent it caught, which has clung to it yet, From my Titmarsh's ramshackle wheezy spinet— Then, methinks, I shall lay it again on the shelf Where the owner looks forward to sleeping himself, In uncommon fine company, too, and I trust ‘There is very snug lying’ up there in the dust. To Lord Byron My Lord, (Do you remember how Leigh Hunt Enraged you once by writing My dear Byron?) Books have their fates—as mortals have who punt— And yours have entered on an age of iron. Critics there be who think your satire blunt— Your pathos, fudge; such perils must environ Poets who in their time were quite the rage, Though now there's not a soul to turn their page. Yes, there is much dispute about your worth, And much is said which you might like to know By modern poets here upon the earth, Where poets live, and love each other so; And, in Elysium, it may move your mirth To hear of bards that pitch your praises low, Though there be some that for your credit stickle, As—glorious Mat This, of course, refers to Matthew Arnold.— and not inglorious Nichol. John Nichol, the Glasgow Professor, and author of Hannibal. (This kind of writing is my pet aversion; I hate the slang, I hate the personalities; I loathe the aimless, reckless, loose dispersion Of every rhyme that in the singer's wallet is; I hate it as you hated the Excursion. But, while no man a hero to his valet is, The hero's still the model; I indite The kind of rhymes that Byron oft would write.) There's a Swiss critic whom I cannot rhyme to, One Scherer, dry as sawdust, grim and prim; Of him there's much to say, if I had time to Concern myself in any wise with him. He seems to hate the heights he cannot climb to, He thinks your poetry a coxcomb's whim; A good deal of his sawdust he has spilt on Shakespeare and Moliere and you and Milton. Ay, much his temper is like Vivien's mood, Which found not Galahad pure nor Lancelot brave; Cold as a hailstorm on an April wood, He buries poets in an icy grave; His Essays—he of the Genevan hood! Nothing so fine, but better doth he crave. So stupid and so solemn in his spite He dares to print that Moliere could not write! Enough of these excursions! I was saying That half our English Bards are turned Reviewers, And Arnold was discussing and assaying The weight and value of that work of yours, Examining and testing it and weighing; And proved, the gems are pure, the gold endures. While Swinburne cries with an exceeding joy, The stones are paste, and half the gold, alloy. In Byron, Arnold finds the greatest force, Poetic, in this later age of ours; His song, a torrent from a mountain source, Clear as the crystal, singing with the showers, Sweeps to the sea in unrestricted course Through banks o'erhung with rocks and sweet with flowers; None of your brooks that modestly meander, But swift as Awe along the Pass of Brander. And when our century has climbed its crest, And backward gazes o'er the plains of time, And counts its harvest, yours is still the best, The richest garner in the field of rhyme. (The metaphoric mixture, 'tis confest, Is all my own, and is not quite sublime. But fame's not yours alone; you must divide all The plums and pudding with the bard of Rydal! Wordsworth and Byron, these the lordly names And these the gods to whom most incense burns ‘Absurd’! cried Swinburne, and in anger flames, And in an Æschylean fury spurns With impious foot your altar, and exclaims, And wreathes his laurels on the golden urns Where Coleridge's and Shelley's ashes lie, Deaf to the din and heedless of the cry. For Byron (Swinburne shouts) has never woven One honest thread of life within his song; As Offenbach is to divine Beethoven So Byron is to Shelley (this is strong!), And on Parnassus' peak, divinely cloven, He may not stand, or stands by cruel wrong; For Byron's rank (the examiner has reckoned) Is in the third class or a feeble second. ‘A Bernesque poet’ at the very most, And ‘never earnest save in politics’; The Pegasus that he was wont to boast A blundering, floundering hackney, full of tricks, A beast that must be driven to the post By whips and spurs and oaths and kicks and sticks, A gasping, ranting, broken-winded brute, That any judge of Pegasi would shoot; In sooth, a half-bred Pegasus, and far gone In spavin, curb, and half a hundred woes; And Byron's style is ‘jolter-headed jargon’; His verse is ‘only bearable in prose’. So living poets write of those that are gone, And o'er the eagle thus the bantam crows; And Swinburne ends where Verisopht began, By owning you ‘a very clever man’. Or rather does not end: he still must utter A quantity of the unkindest things. Ah! were you here, I marvel, would you flutter O'er such a foe the tempest of your wings? 'Tis ‘rant and cant and glare and splash and splutter’ That rend the modest air when Byron sings. There Swinburne stops: a critic rather fiery. Animis cælestibus tantæ ne iræ? But whether he or Arnold in the right is, Long is the argument, the quarrel long; Non nobis est to settle tantas lites; No poet I, to judge of right or wrong: But of all things I always think a fight is The most unpleasant in the lists of song; When Marsyas of old was flayed, Apollo Set an example which we need not follow. The fashion changes! Maidens do not wear, As once they wore, in necklaces and lockets A curl ambrosial of Lord Byron's hair; ‘Don Juan’ is not always in our pockets— Nay, a New Writer's readers do not care Much for your verse, but are inclined to mock its Manners and morals. Ay, and most young ladies To yours prefer the ‘Epic’ called ‘of Hades’! I do not blame them; I'm inclined to think That with the reigning taste 'tis vain to quarrel; And Burns might teach his votaries to drink, And Byron never meant to make them moral. You yet have lovers true, who will not shrink From lauding you and giving you the laurel; The Germans too, those men of blood and iron, Of all our poets chiefly swear by Byron. Farewell, thou Titan fairer than the gods! Farewell, farewell, thou swift and lively spirit, Thou splendid warrior with the world at odds, Unpraised, unpraisable, beyond thy merit; Chased, like Orestes, by the Furies' rods, Like him at length thy peace dost thou inherit; Beholding whom, men think how fairer far Than all the steadfast stars the wandering star! The Friend of Man By a Poet The dog they style ‘The Friend of Man’, I've read it in the prose of Cobbe— (Miss Frances Power)—since youth began I ‘never loved’ a black and tan, Yet style me not, with hasty ban, A snob! The poets are his friends, they say, And Byron wrote his epitaph, As kind, courageous, simple, gay, Last at the feast, first at the fray: At Boatswain and at Poor Dog Tray I laugh! We meet him first in Homer's verse, The dog by the Ægean seas; He barks at strangers, ay, and worse, He bites! We learn, in language terse, That even Argos has the curse Of fleas! ‘There lay the old dog, Argos, full of fleas!’—Hobbes' Odyssey. The Temple of Bosh To the Temple of Bosh in a vision Was I led in a vaporous land; Common sense is a butt and derision, Where the altars of Fantasy stand. There the Theories dwell that have faded And the notions that never would wash; They abide, unimpeached, uninvaded, In the Temple of Bosh! There the wheels of Perpetual Motion Make a musical whirr in the air, The philosophers there have a notion That the circle is easy to square; There the flatt'ners of earth are deficient, And the Tribes that were Lost, they are found; And the arkite ideas of Bryant Do greatly abound! The believers in Home and in Slade'll Be welcomed as children of grace; And there's the original cradle That rocked all the Aryan race. And hypotheses, lunar and solar, Of myth, go about and about: And nobody deems that the whole are A matter of doubt! There the spelling is purely phonetic; Vaccination's entirely forbid; And the light of the Remnant æsthetic No more 'neath a bushel is hid. As ‘no remedy’ force is suspended Human life is not worth a golosh— Let us end, lest our days should be ended In the Temple of Bosh! The Member for Crete Epimenides noted—'tis cited by Paul— That ‘The Cretans are liars, for ever and all’. If the classical island were blessed with a seat, Can you guess whom they'd choose as the Member for Crete? Oh, many would start for so goodly a stake, Oh, many would run for the seat—and ‘the cake’; Munchausen and Mendez would gaily compete, But they'd not have a chance with the Caucus in Crete! Ananias is gifted, the Serpent is glib, They are both of them lenient to fable and fib; But, like Bannerman, both have been once ‘indiscreet’— Been found out—and they cannot be Members for Crete! No! the Member must talk with so noble an air That a perjury comes from his lips like a prayer; And his words, day by day, he must gallantly eat, And appear to enjoy it—the Member for Crete! In a proud indignation the man must excel, In a voice like a trumpet must charges repel, And ‘I never said one of the words you repeat’ He must say—though he said them—the Member for Crete! But it seems, and I note it with poignant regret, That Crete has no chance for a deputy yet; For the island is chained at the Ottoman's feet, And they are not electing a Member for Crete! Epimenides deemed—it's acknowledged by all— That truth, on the Cretans, would commonly pall; If the beautiful island were graced with a seat, We could spare it a choice of a Member for Crete! Chinook and Chinok Chinook and Chinok were magicians of merit Who each of them kept a familiar spirit; They lived, we should tell you, a long while ago, Between the Red Men and the wild Eskimo; And the feats of the common magicians they'd mock, Of the noisy Pow-wow, and the dark Angekok, But the best of good friends were Chinook and Chinok! It was nothing to either to fly in the air, To float like a fish, or to climb like a bear. It was nothing to either to change by a wish, His foes into fowls, and his friends into fish! Thought Chinook, ‘I shall ask old Chinok to a feast, And charm him, for fun, to the shape of a beast, And when I have laughed at his fright till I'm black, Why—dear old Chinok! I will alter him back’. So he sent to Chinok, and he asked him to dine. Thought Chinok to himself, ‘I've an artful design, For I'll change old Chinook to some sort of beast, And I'll soon charm him back at the end of the feast!’ So they met, and their medicine-bags laid on the shelf; But each had a powder he kept to himself— A powder for making his friend look absurd By changing him into a beast or a bird; While each in his medicine-bag stored up another, By which he'd restore his old shape to his brother. Then both, when they settled serenely to eat, Dropped a pinch of the powder unseen on the meat; And Chinook with a grin, began making his mock: ‘Why, you're changing’, he cried, ‘to a badger, Chinok!’ And Chinok, who felt rather uneasy, cried ‘Look, You are changing yourself to a toad, my Chinook!’ Then each of them longed to return to himself, But the bags with the powders were high on the shelf; And the badger can't climb, and the toad could not hop To the shelf where the medicine-bags lay on the top; So the pair could not reach them by hook or by crook, And a badger and toad are Chinok and Chinook! Yes, a toad and a badger those worthies remain, And the moral of all is uncommonly plain, That good luck never comes to a person who pokes At a host or a guest his dull practical jokes! Summer's Ending The flags below the shadowy fern Shine like spears between sun and sea; The tide and the summer begin to turn, And ah, for hearts, for hearts that yearn, For fires of autumn that catch and burn, For love gone out between thee and me. The wind is up, and the weather broken, Blue seas, blue eyes, are grieved and gray; Listen, the word that the wind has spoken, Listen, the sound of the sea—a token That summer's over, and troths are broken— That loves depart as the hours decay. A love has passed to the loves passed over; A month has fled to the months gone by; And none may follow, and none recover July and June, and never a lover May stay the wings of the loves that hover, As fleet as the light in a sunset sky. Matrimony (Matrimony—Advertiser would like to hear from well-educated Protestant lady, under thirty, fair, with view to above, who would have no objection to work Remington type-writer, at home. Enclose photo. T. 99. This Office. Cork newspaper.) T. 99 would gladly hear From one whose years are few— A maid whose doctrines are severe, Of Presbyterian blue; Also—with view to the above— Her photo he would see, And trusts that she may live and love His Protestant to be! But ere the sacred rites are done And by no priest of Rome He'd ask, if she a Remington Type-writer works—at home? If she have no objections to This task, and if her hair— In keeping with her eyes of blue— Be delicately fair; Ah, then, let her a photo send Of all her charms divine, To him who rests her faithful friend, Her own T. 99. Ye Ministers of England Ye Ministers of England Who pare the native cheese, Who care more for the Caucus than Our safety on the seas; Your old excuses launch again Ye forged long, long ago, As ye prate through debate Of the things we must not know— Of the questions about ships and forts We must not ‘want to know’. Britannia does need bulwarks And towers along the steep; She's scant of powder, ships and men; Her rulers are asleep; The thunder from her phantom fleet The French can overcrow With thy might, Melinite, While the stormy tempests blow— While the battle rages, short and sharp, And the stormy tempests blow. The meteor flag of England May yet terrific burn Above the ruin of her trade The ashes of her urn. Then, then, ye bold officials, Perchance you'll come to know The hate of the State In an hour of overthrow, When a ruined people turn in wrath On you that wrought their woe. A Dialogue Lui. Oh, have you found the Fount of Youth, Or have you faced the Fire of Kôr? Or whence the form, the eyes, the mouth, The voice, the grace we praised of yore? Ah, lightly must the years have sped— The long, the labour-laden years— That cast no snows upon your head, Nor dim your eyes with any tears! And gently must the heart have beat, That, after many days, can send So soft, so kind a blush to greet The advent of so old a friend. Elle. Another tale doth it repeat, My mirror; and it tells me true! But time, the thief of all things sweet, Has failed to steal one grace from you. One touch of youth he cannot steal, One trait there is he leaves you yet— The boyish loyalty, the leal Absurd, impossible regret! These are the magic: these restore A phantom of the April prime, Show you the face you liked of yore, And give me back the thefts of time! On Calais Sands On Calais Sands the gray began, Then rosy red above the gray, The morn with many a scarlet van Leap'd, and the world was glad with May! The little waves along the bay Broke white upon the shelving strands; The sea-mews flitted white as they On Calais Sands. On Calais Sands must man with man Wash honour clean in blood to-day; On spaces wet from waters wan How white the flashing rapiers play— Parry, riposte! and lunge! The fray Shifts for a while, then mournful stands The victor: life ebbs fast away On Calais Sands. On Calais Sands a little space Of silence; then the splash and spray, The sound of eager waves that ran To kiss the perfumed locks astray, To touch those lips that ne'er said ‘Nay’— To dally with the helpless hands; Till the deep sea in silence lay On Calais Sands. Between the lilac and the may She waits her love from alien lands; Her love is colder than the clay On Calais Sands. An Old Prayer ????? ???, ? ????????, ????????? ??? ? ?? ????? ???? ??? ???????, ?? ?? ??? ?????????? ????????. Odyssey xiii. 59. My prayer an old prayer borroweth Of ancient love and memory— ‘Do thou farewell, till eld and death, That come to all men, come to thee’. Gently as winter's early breath, Scarce felt, what time the swallows flee To lands whereof no man knoweth Of summer, over land and sea; So with thy soul may summer be, Even as the ancient singer saith, ‘Do thou farewell, till eld and death, That come to all men, come to thee’. A Lost Path Plotinus, the Greek philosopher, had a certain proper mode of ecstasy, whereby, as Porphyry saith, his soul, becoming free from his deathly flesh, was made one with the Spirit that is in the world. Alas, the path is lost! we cannot leave Our bright, our clouded life, and pass away As through strewn clouds that stain the quiet eve, To heights remoter of the purer day. The soul may not, returning whence she came, Bathe herself deep in being, and forget The joys that fever, and the cares that fret, Made once more one with the eternal flame That breathes in all things ever more the same. She would be young again, thus drinking deep Of her old life; and this has been, men say, But this we know not, who have only sleep To soothe us—sleep more terrible than day— Where dead delights, and fair lost faces stray, To make us weary at our wakening; And of that long-lost path to the Divine We dream, as some Greek shepherd erst might sing, Half credulous, of easy Proserpine, And of the lands that lie ‘beneath the day's decline’. From Omar Khayyám Rhymed from the prose version of Mr. Justin Huntly M‘Carthy The paradise they bid us fast to win Hath wine and women; is it then a sin To live as we shall live in paradise, And make a heaven of earth, ere heaven begin? The wise may search the world from end to end, From dusty nook to dusty nook, my friend, And nothing better find than girls and wine, Of all the things they neither make nor mend. Nay, listen thou who, walking on life's way, Hast seen no lovelock of thy love's grow gray— Listen, and love thy life, and let the wheel Of heaven go spinning its own wilful way. Man is a flagon, and his soul the wine, Man is a lamp, wherein the soul doth shine; Man is a shaken reed, wherein that wind, The soul, doth ever rustle and repine. Each morn I say, to-night I will repent; Repent! and each night go the way I went— The way of wine; but now that reigns the rose, Lord of repentance, rage not, but relent. I wish to drink of wine—so deep, so deep— The scent of wine my sepulchre shall steep, And they, the revellers by Omar's tomb, Shall breathe it, and in wine shall fall asleep. Before the rent walls of a ruined town Lay the king's skull, whereby a bird flew down; ‘And where’, he sang, ‘is all thy clash of arms? Where the sonorous trumps of thy renown?’ Disdainful Diaphenia There is no venom in the rose That any bee should shrink from it; No poison from the lily flows, She hath not a disdainful wit; But thou, that rose and lily art, Thy tongue doth poison Cupid's dart! Nature herself to deadly flowers Refuseth beauty, lest the vain Insects that hum through August hours With beauty should suck in their bane; But thou, as rose or lily fair, Art circled with envenomed air! Like Progne didst thou lose thy tongue, Thy lovers might adore and live; Like that witch Circe, oft besung, Thou hast dear gifts, if thou wouldst give; But since thou hast a wicked wit, Thy lovers fade, or flee from it. Celia's Eyes Pastiche Tell me not that babies dwell In the deeps of Celia's eyes; Cupid in each hazel well Scans his beauties with surprise, And would, like Narcissus, drown In my Celia's eyes of brown. Tell me not that any goes Safe by that enchanted place; Eros dwells with Anteros In the garden of her face, Where like friends who late were foes Meet the white and crimson rose. The Daughters of Cecrops It is a plausible conjecture that the three archaic statues of women discovered in the soil of the Acropolis, near the Erechtheum, represent Aglaurus, Ersé and Pandrosus, daughters of Cecrops, the serpent king of mythical Athens. They are in the archaic style of Greek art before the Persian war, and may well have been buried when, at the command of the Delphian Oracle, the Athenians deserted their city, sought their ‘wooden walls’ and defeated Xerxes at Salamis. ‘Go forth, go forth,’ the Pythia said, ‘Vex me no more, but flee afar The fire, the sword, the death, the dread, That sweep behind the Syrian car. Lo! blood drips from the temple wall, The end is nigh, the end of all!’ The voice from Delphi boded woe; The sacred serpent did forsake His ancient haunts, and would forgo The proffer of the honey-cake; While, men's hearts failing them for fear, They watched the death of Greece draw near. The Great King's will—an eastern wind— Black storms of men before him drave Cloud upon cloud, with clouds behind, And every soul of them a slave, And one hope moving one and all— To see the last free people fall! Then ere the warriors took the sea Men did conceal their holy things, Their ancient gods that had been free, And might not brook the breath of kings; And statues three they buried thus— Aglaurus, Ersé, Pandrosus. The daughters of the Serpent King They laid them by Erechtheus' shrine, In mother-earth; and sorrowing Betook them to their walls of pine, And fought at Salamis, and freed Their land, their gods, and smote the Mede. Perchance at Salamis they fell, The men who knew the secret spot Where Cecrops' marble daughters dwell, Forsaken and remembered not. Howe'er it chanced, in earth they lay Unknown, unworshipped till to-day. And twice a thousand years have sped, And Greece, that was enslaved, is free; Though her old fanes are fallen—fled The goddess of the Ægidæ; But these three marble maidens dwell Unharmed, beside Athênê's well! As new arisen they stand to-day, Fresh from the hand of Canochus; The re-arisen Hellas may Defy the lapse of ages thus; In time's despite serenely fair, A marvel in Athenian air! The laurel of the god of old Was proof against the thunderstroke. On laurel'd Hellas Persia rolled In thunder, and in spray she broke; Even so this present tyranny Must break, and leave serener sky! The Restoration of Romance H Rider Haggard, Robert Louis Stevenson, A. Conan Doyle, Stanley Weyman. To H. R. H., R. L. S., A. C. D., and S. W. King romance was wounded deep, All his knights were dead and gone, All his court was fallen on sleep, In a vale of Avalon! Nay, men said, he will not come, Any night or any morn. Nay, his puissant voice is dumb, Silent his enchanted horn! King Romance was forfeited, Banished from his royal home, With a price upon his head, Driven with sylvan folk to roam. King Romance is fallen, banned, Cried his foeman overbold, Broken is the wizard wand, All the stories have been told! Then you came from south and north— From Tugela, from the Tweed; Blazoned his achievements forth, King Romance is come indeed! All his foes are overthrown, All their wares cast out in scorn, King Romance hath won his own, And the lands where he was born! Marsac at adventure rides, Felon men meet felon scathe; Micah Clarke is taking sides For King Monmouth and the Faith; For a cause or for a lass Men are willing to be slain, And the dungeons of the Bass Hold a prisoner again. King Romance with wand of gold Sways the realms he ruled of yore— Hills Dalgetty roamed of old, Valleys of enchanted Kôr: Waves his sceptre o'er the isles, Claims the pirates' treasuries, Through innumerable miles Of the siren-haunted seas. Elfin folk of coast and cave, Laud him in the woven dance; All the tribes of wold and wave Bow the knee to King Romance! Wand'ring voices Chaucer knew On the mountain and the main, Cry the haunted forest through, King Romance has come again! Boat Song Adrift, with starlit skies above, With starlit seas below, We move with all the suns that move, With all the seas that flow: For, bond or free, earth, sky, and sea, Wheel with one central will, And thy heart drifteth on to me, And only time stands still. Between two shores of death we drift, Behind are things forgot; Before, the tide is racing swift To shores man knoweth not. Above, the sky is far and cold; Below, the moaning sea Sweeps o'er the loves that were of old, But thou, Love, love thou me. Ah, lonely are the ocean ways, And dangerous the deep, And frail the fairy barque that strays Above the seas asleep. Ah, toil no more with helm or oar, We drift, or bond or free; On yon far shore the breakers roar, But thou, Love, love thou me! Æsop He sat among the woods, he heard The sylvan merriment: he saw The pranks of butterfly and bird, The humours of the ape, the daw. And in the lion or the frog, In all the life of moor and fen, In ass and peacock, stork and dog, He read similitudes of men. ‘Of these, from these’, he cried, ‘we come; Our hearts, our brains descend from these.’ And lo! the beasts no more were dumb, But answered out of brakes and trees: ‘Not ours,’ they cried; ‘Degenerate, If ours at all,’ they cried again, ‘Ye fools, who war with God and Fate, Who strive and toil—strange race of men. ‘For we are neither bond nor free, For we have neither slaves nor kings; But near to Nature's heart are we, And conscious of her secret things. ‘Content are we to fall asleep, And well content to wake no more; We do not laugh, we do not weep, Nor look behind us and before; ‘But were there cause for moan or mirth, 'Tis we, not you, should sigh or scorn, O latest children of the earth, Most childish children earth has borne!’ They spoke, but that misshapen slave Told never of the thing he heard, And unto men their portraits gave In likenesses of beast and bird! Les Roses de Sâdi This morning I vowed I would bring thee my roses, They were thrust in the band that my bodice encloses; But the breast-knots were broken, the roses went free. The breast-knots were broken; the roses together Floated forth on the wings of the wind and the weather, And they drifted afar down the streams of the sea. And the sea was as red as when sunset uncloses; But my raiment is sweet from the scent of the roses, Thou shalt know, love, how fragrant a memory can be. Central American Antiquities In South Kensington Museum ‘Youth and crabbed age Cannot live together;’ So they say. On this little page See you when and whether That they may. Age was very old— Stones from Chichimec Hardly wrung; Youth had hair of gold Knotted on her neck— Fair and young! Age was carved with odd Slaves, and priests that slew them— God and beast; Man and beast and god— There she sat and drew them, King and priest! There she sat and drew Many a monstrous head And antique; Horrors from Peru— Huacas doubly dead, Dead cacique! Ere Pizarro came These were lords of men Long ago; Gods without a name, Born or how or when, None may know! Now from Yucatan These doth science bear Over seas; And methinks a man Finds youth doubly fair, Sketching these! Tall Salmacis Were an apple-tree a pine, Tall and slim and softly swaying, Then her beauty were like thine, Salmacis, when boune a Maying, Tall as any poplar tree, Sweet as apple-blossoms be! Had the Amazonian queen Seen thee 'midst thy maiden peers, Thou the coronel hadst been Of that lady's grenadiers; Troy had never mourned her fall, With thine axe to guard her wall. As Penthesilea brave Is the maiden (in her dreams); Ilium she well might save, Though Achilles' armour gleams 'Midst the Greeks; all vain it is, 'Gainst the glance of Salmacis! The New Blondel O ma Reine! Although the minstrel's lost you long, Although for bread the minstrel sings, Ah, still for you he pipes the song, And thrums upon the crazy strings! As Blondel sang by cot and hall, Through town and stream and forest passed, And found, at length, the dungeon wall, And freed the Lion-heart at last— So must your hapless minstrel fare, By hill and hollow violing; He flings a ditty on the air, He wonders if you hear him sing! For in some castle you must dwell Of this wide land he wanders through— In palace, tower, or cloistered cell— He knows not; but he sings to you! The wind may blow it to your ear, And you, perchance, may understand; But from your lattice, though you hear, He knows you will not wave a hand. Your eyes upon the page may fall, More like the page will miss your eyes; You may be listening after all, So goes he singing till he dies. The Promise of Helen Whom hast thou longed for most, True love of mine? Whom hast thou loved and lost? Lo, she is thine! She that another wed Breaks from her vow; She that hath long been dead Wakes for thee now. Dreams haunt the hapless bed, Ghosts haunt the night; Life crowns her living head, Love and delight. Nay, not a dream nor ghost, Nay, but divine, She that was loved and lost Waits to be thine! Rhyme of Rhymes Wild on the mountain peak the wind Repeats its old refrain, Like ghosts of mortals who have sinned, And fain would sin again. For ‘wind’ I do not rhyme to ‘mind’, Like many mortal men, ‘Again’ (when one reflects) 'twere kind To rhyme as if ‘agen’. I never met a single soul Who spoke of ‘wind’ as ‘wined’; And yet we use it, on the whole, To rhyme to ‘find’ and ‘blind’. We say, ‘Now don't do that agen’, When people give us pain; In poetry, nine times in ten, It rhymes to ‘Spain’ or ‘Dane’. Oh, which is wrong or which is right? Oh, which are right or wrong? The sounds in prose familiar, quite, Or those we meet in song? To hold that ‘love’ can rhyme to ‘prove’ Requires some force of will; Yet in the ancient lyric groove We meet them rhyming still. This was our learned fathers' wont In prehistoric times, We follow it, or if we don't, We oft run short of rhymes. Ballad of the (School-Board) Fleet Which my name is Stoker Bill, And a pleasant post I fill, And the care the ladies take of me is clipping; And they've made me pretty snug With a blooming Persian rug In the Ladies' Model School-board Training Shipping! There's my Whistler etchings, there, As are quite beyond compare, And a portrait of Miss Connie Gilchrist skipping; From such art we all expect Quite a softening effect, In the Ladies' new Æsthetic Training Shipping. And my beer comes in a mug— Such a rare old Rhodian jug! And here I sits æsthetically sipping; And I drinks my grog or ale On a chair by Chippendale— We've no others in our Model Training Shipping. There's our first Liftenant, too, Is a fine old (China) Blue, And you do not very often catch him tripping At a monogram or mark, But no more than Noah's ark, Does he know the way to manage this here Shipping. But the boys! the boys, they stands With white lilies in their hands, And they do not know the meaning of a whipping; For the whole delightful ship is Like a dream of Lippo Lippi's, More than what you mostly see in modern Shipping. Well, some coves they cuts up rough, And they call æthetics stuff, And they says as we've no business to keep dipping In the rates; but ladies likes it, And our flag we never strikes it; Bless old England's new Æsthetic Training Shipping! The Philanthropist Pomona Road and Gardens, N., Were pure as they were fair; In other districts much I fear That vulgar language shocks the ear; But brawling wives or noisy men Were never heard of there. No burglar fixed his dread abode In that secure retreat; There were no public-houses nigh, But chapels low and churches high; You might have thought Pomona Road A quite ideal beat! Yet that was not at all the view Taken by B. 13. That active and intelligent Policeman deemed that he was meant Profound detective deeds to do, And that repose was mean. Now there was nothing to detect Pomona Road along; None faked a cly, nor cracked a crib, Nor prigged a wipe, nor told a fib; Minds cultivated and select Slip rarely into wrong! Thus bored to desolation went The peeler on his beat; He knew not love, he did not care, If love be born on mountains bare; Nay, crime to punish or prevent, Was more than dalliance sweet! The weary wanderer, day by day, Was marked by Howard Fry— A neighbouring philanthropist, Who saw what that policeman missed— A sympathetic ‘Well-a-day’ He'd moan, and pipe his eye. ‘What can I do’, asked Howard Fry, ‘To soothe that brother's pain? His glance when first we met was keen, Most martial and erect his mien’ (What mien may mean, I know not I) ‘But he must joy again.’ ‘I'll start on a career of crime, I will,’ said Howard Fry; He spake and acted! deeds of bale (With which I do not stain my tale) He wrought like mad, time after time, Yet wrought them blushfully. And now when 'buses night by night Were stopped, conductors slain, When youths and men, and maids unwed, Were stabbed or knocked upon the head, Then B. 13 grew sternly bright, And was himself again! Pomona Road and Gardens, N., Are now a name of fear; Commercial travellers flee in haste, Revolvers girt about the waist Are worn by city gentlemen Who have their mansions near. But B. 13 elated goes, Detection in his eye; While Howard Fry does deeds of bale (With which I do not stain my tale) To lighten that policeman's woes, But does them blushfully. Moral Such is Philanthropy, my friends, Too often such her plan, She shoots, and stabs, and robs, and flings Bombs and all sorts of horrid things. Ah, not to serve her private ends, But for the good of Man! On an Expensive Volume of Verse They were scribbled in sketch books and fly books, In lectures, on lochs, by the seas; And wherefore do people who buy books Go purchasing these? A scholar was I, in the way to Be idle with pencil and pen, And I rhymed—while the master read Plato— Of Phæacian men. When the Ettrick was sullenly frozen With snows on the hills and the plain, The tune for my singing was chosen Of ‘The Sirens Again’. On ladies that never existed (Or never in space and in time) I founded my fancies, and twisted The strands of a rhyme. It was evil example that brought me To rhyme, and to run to the Row, And Swinburne and Tennyson taught me Whatever I know. JUBILEE POEMS What Francesco said of the Jubilee By R. B. Robert Browning. What if we call it fifty years! 'Tis steep! To climb so high a gradient? Prate of guides? Are we not roped? The danger? Nay, the Turf, No less nor more than mountain peaks, my friend, Hears talk of Roping—but the Jubilee! Nay, there you have me: old Francesco once (This was in Milan, in Visconti's time, Our wild Visconti, with one lip askance, And beard tongue-twisted in the nostril's nook) Parlous enough—these times—what? ‘So are ours’? Or any times, i'fegs, to him who thinks— Well 'twas in spring ‘the frolic myrtle trees There gendered the grave olive stocks’—you cry ‘A miracle’!—Sordello writeth thus— Believe me that indeed 'twas thus, and he, Francesco, you are with me? Well, there's gloom No less than gladness in your fifty years, ‘And so’, said he, ‘to supper as we may.’ ‘Voltairean’? So you take it; but 'tis late, And dinner seven, sharp, at Primrose Hill. The Poet and the Jubilee Poscimur! By A. D. Austin Dobson. A birthday Ode for Meg or Nan, A Rhyme for Lady Flora's Fan, A Verse on Smut, who's gone astray— These Things are in the Poet's way; At Home with praise of Julia's Lace, Or Delia's Ankles, Rose's Face, But ‘Something overparted’ He, When asked to rhyme the Jubilee! He therefore turns, the Poet wary, And thumbs his Carmen Seculare, To Ph(ce)bus and to Dian prays, Who tune Men's Lyres of Holidays; He reads of the Sibylline Shades, Of Stainless Boys and chosen Maids. He turns, and reads the other Page, Of docile Youth, and placid Age, Then sings how, in this golden year Fides Pudorque reappear— And if they don't appear, you know it Were quite unjust to blame the Poet! On any Beach By M. A. Matthew Arnold. Yes, in the stream and stress of things, That breaks around us like the sea, There comes to peasants and to kings, The solemn hour of Jubilee. If they, till strenuous nature give Some fifty harvests, chance to live! Ah, fifty harvests! But the corn Is grown beside the barren main; Is salt with sea-spray, blown and borne Across the green unvintaged plain. And life, lived out for fifty years, Is briny with the spray of tears! Ah, such is life, to us that live Here, in the twilight of the gods, Who weigh each gift the world can give, And sigh and murmur, What's the odds So long's you're happy? Nay, what man Finds happiness since time began? Ode of Jubilee By A. C. S. A. C. Swinburne. Me, that have sung and shrieked, and foamed in praise of freedom, Me do you ask to sing Parochial pomps, and waste, the wail of Jubileedom For Queen, or Prince, or King! Nay, by the foam that fleeting oars have feathered In Grecian seas; Nay, by the winds that barques Athenian weathered— By all of these I bid you each be mute, Bards tamed and tethered, And fee'd with fees! For you the laurel smirched, for you the gold, too, Of magazines; For me the Spirit of Song, unbought, unsold to Pale priests or queens! For you the gleam of gain, the fluttering cheque Of Mr. Knowles; For me, to soar above the ruins and wreck Of Snobs and ‘Souls’! When aflush with the dew of the dawn, and the Rose of the mystical vision, The spirit and soul of the men of the Future shall rise and be free, They shall hail me with hymning and harping, With eloquent art and Elysian— The singer who sung not but spurned them, The slaves that could sing ‘Jubilee’; With pinchbeck lyre and tongue, Praising their tyrant sung, They shall fail and shall fade in derision, As wind on the ways of the sea! Jubilee before Revolution By W. M. William Morris. ‘Tell me, O Muse of the shifty, the man who wandered afar’, So have I chanted of late, and of Troy burg wasted of war— Now of the sorrows of menfolk that fifty years have been, Now of the grace of the commune I sing, and the days of a queen! Surely I curse rich menfolk, ‘the Wights of the Whirlwind’ may they— This is my style of translating “???????—snatch them away! The rich thieves rolling in wealth that make profit of labouring men, Surely the Wights of the Whirlwind shall swallow them quick in their den! O baneful, O wit-straying, in the burg of London ye dwell, And ever of profits and three per cent. are the tales ye tell; But the stark, strong Polyphemus shall answer you back again, Him whom ‘No man slayeth by guile and not by main’. (By ‘main’ I mean ‘main force’, if aught at all do I mean; In the Greek of the blindfold bard it is simpler the sense to glean.) You, Polyphemus shall swallow and fill his mighty maw, What time he maketh an end of the Priests, the Police, and the Law; And then, ah, who shall purchase the poems of old that I sang; Who shall pay twelve-and-six for an epic in Saga slang? But perchance even ‘Hermes the Flitter’ could scarcely expound what I mean, And I trow that another were fitter to sing you a song for a queen.</field>

Mais je me suis mis à faire cette traittie d'affliction contte ma droite nature . . . . et suis content de I'avoir prinse, car mes douleurs me semblent en estre allegees.’—Le Romant de Troilus. [To all old friends; to all who dwell] To all old friends; to all who dwell Where Avon dhu and Avon gel Down to the deep Loch Aline flow Through valleys dear from long ago; To all who hear the whisper'd spell Of Ken; and Tweed like music swell Hard by the Land Debatable, Or Drayton's Yarty seaward go,— To all old friends! To all that yet remember well What secrets Isis had to tell, How lazy Cherwell loiter'd slow Sweet aisles of blossom'd may below— Whate'er befall, whate'er befell, To all old friends. Book I Of the coming of Paris to the house of Menelaus, King of Lacedæmon, and of the tale Paris told concerning his past life. THE COMING OF PARIS I All day within the palace of the King In Lacedæmon, was there revelry, Since Menelaus with the dawn did spring Forth from his carven couch, and, climbing high The tower of outlook, gazed along the dry White road that runs to Pylos through the plain, And mark'd thin clouds of dust against the sky, And gleaming bronze, and robes of purple stain. II Then cried he to his serving men, and all Obey'd him, and their labour did not spare; And women set out tables through the hall, Light polish'd tables, with the linen fair. And water from the well did others bear, And the good house-wife busily brought forth Meats from her store, and stinted not the rare Wine from Ismarian vineyards of the north. III The men drave up a heifer from the field For sacrifice, and sheath'd her horns with gold; And strong Boethöus the axe did wield And smote her; on the fruitful earth she roll'd, And they her limbs divided; fold on fold They laid the fat, and cast upon the fire The barley grain. Such rites were wrought of old When all was order'd as the gods desire. IV And now the chariots came beneath the trees Hard by the palace portals, in the shade, And Menelaus knew King Diocles Of Pheræ, sprung of an unhappy maid Whom the great Elian river god betray'd In the still watches of a summer night, When by his deep green water-course she stray'd And lean'd to pluck his water-lilies white. V Beside King Diocles there sat a man —Of all men mortal sure the fairest far— For o'er his purple robe Sidonian His yellow hair shone brighter than the star Of the long golden locks that bodeth war; His face was like the sunshine, and his blue Glad eyes no sorrow had the spell to mar Were clear as skies the storm hath thunder'd through. VI The stranger-prince was follow'd by a band Of men, all clad like rovers of the sea, And brown'd were they as is the desert sand; Loud in their mirth, and of their bearing free; And gifts they bore, from the deep treasury And forests of some far-off eastern lord, Vases of gold, and bronze, and ivory, That might the Pythian fane have over-stored. VII Then Menelaus spake unto his folk, And eager at his word they ran amain, And loosed the sweating horses from the yoke, And cast before them spelt, and barley grain. And lean'd the polish'd car, with golden rein, Against the shining spaces of the wall; And called the sea-rovers who follow'd fain Within the pillar'd fore-courts of the hall. VIII Now when the king had greeted Diocles And him that seem'd his guest, the twain were led To the dim polish'd baths, where, for their ease, Cool water o'er their lustrous limbs was shed; With oil anointed was each goodly head By Asteris and Phylo fair of face; Next, like two gods for loveliness, they sped To Menelaus in the banquet-place. IX There were they seated at the king's right hand, And maidens bare them bread, and meat, and wine, Within that fair hall of the Argive land Whose doors and roof with gold and silver shine As doth the dwelling-place of Zeus divine. And Helen came from forth her fragrant bower The fairest lady of immortal line, Like morning, when the rosy dawn doth flower. X Adraste set for her a shining chair, Well-wrought of cedar-wood and ivory; And beautiful Alcippe led the fair, The well-beloved child, Hermione,— A little maiden of long summers three— Her star-like head on Helen's breast she laid, And peep'd out at the strangers wistfully As is the wont of children half afraid. XI Now when desire of meat and drink was done, And ended was the joy of minstrelsy, Queen Helen spake, beholding how the sun Within the heaven of bronze was riding high: ‘Truly, my friends, methinks the hour is nigh When men may crave to know what need doth bring To Lacedæmon, o'er wet ways and dry, This prince that bears the sceptre of a king? XII ‘Yea, or perchance a god is he, for still The great gods wander on our mortal ways, And watch their altars upon mead or hill And taste our sacrifice, and hear our lays; And now, perchance, will heed if any prays; And now will vex us with unkind control; But anywise must man live out his days, For fate hath given him an enduring soul. XIII ‘Then tell us, prithee, all that may be told, And if thou art a mortal, joy be thine! And if thou art a god, then rich with gold Thine altar in our palace court shall shine, With roses garlanded and wet with wine, And we shall praise thee with unceasing breath; Ah, then be gentle as thou art divine, And bring not on us grievous love or death!’ XIV Then spake the stranger—as when to a maid A young man speaks, his voice was soft and low— ‘Alas, no god am I; be not afraid, For even now the nodding daisies grow Whose seed above my grassy cairn shall blow, When I am nothing but a drift of white Dust in a cruse of gold; and nothing know But darkness, and immeasurable night. XV ‘The dawn, or noon, or twilight, draweth near When one shall smite me on the bridge of war; Or with the ruthless sword, or with the spear, Or with the bitter arrow flying far. But as a man's heart, so his good days are, That Zeus, the lord of thunder, giveth him, Wherefore I follow fortune, like a star, Whate'er may wait me in the distance dim. XVI ‘Now all men call me Paris, Priam's son, Who widely rules a peaceful folk and still. Nay, though ye dwell afar off, there is none But hears of Ilios on the windy hill, And of the plain that the two rivers fill With murmuring sweet streams the whole year long, And walls the gods have wrought with wondrous skill Where cometh never man to do us wrong. XVII ‘Wherefore I sail'd not here for help in war, Though well the Argives in such need can aid. The force that comes on me is other far; One that on all men comes: I seek the maid Whom golden Aphrodite shall persuade To lay her hand in mine, and follow me, To my white halls within the cedar shade Beyond the restless waters of the sea.’ XVIII Then at the goddess' name grew Helen pale, Like golden stars that flicker in the dawn; Or like a child that hears a dreadful tale; Or like the roses on a rich man's lawn, When now the suns of summer are withdrawn, And the loose leaves with a sad wind are stirr'd, Till the wet grass is strewn with petals wan— So paled the golden Helen at his word. XIX But swift the rose into her cheek return'd And for a little moment, like a flame, The perfect face of Argive Helen burn'd, As doth a woman's, when some spoken name Brings back to mind some ancient love or shame. But none save Paris mark'd the thing, who said, ‘My tale no more must weary this fair dame, With telling why I wander all unwed.’ XX But Helen, bending on him gracious brows, Besought him for the story of his quest; For sultry is the summer, that allows To mortal men no sweeter boon than rest; And surely such a tale as thine is best To make the dainty-footed hours go by, Till sinks the sun in darkness and the west, And soft stars lead the night along the sky.’ XXI Then at the word of Helen Paris spoke, ‘My tale is shorter than a summer day— My mother, ere I saw the light, awoke, At dawn, in Ilios, shrieking in dismay, Who dream'd that 'twixt her feet there fell and lay A flaming brand, that utterly burn'd down To dust of crumbling ashes red and gray, The coronal of towers and all Troy town. XXII ‘Then the interpretation of this dream My father sought at many priestly hands; Where the white temple doth in Pytho gleam, And at the fane of Ammon in the sands, And where the oak tree of Dodona stands With boughs oracular against the sky,— And with one voice the gods from all the lands, Cried out, “The child must die, the child must die”. XXIII ‘Thus was I born to sorrow; and in fear The dark priest took me from my sire, and bore A wailing child through beech and pinewood drear, Up to the knees of Ida, and the hoar Rocks whence a fountain welleth evermore, And steals with sullen waters to the sea, Through black and rock-wall'd pools without a shore— And there they deem'd they took farewell of me. XXIV ‘But round my neck they tied a golden ring That fell from Ganymedes when he soar'd High over Ida on the eagle's wing, To dwell for ever with the gods adored— To be the cup-bearer beside the board Of Zeus, and kneel at the eternal throne— A jewel 'twas from old King Tros's hoard, That ruled in Ilios ages long agone. XXV ‘And there they left me in that dell untrod— Shepherd nor huntsman ever wanders there, For dread of Pan, that is a jealous god— Yea, and the ladies of the streams forbear The Naiad nymphs, to weave their dances fair, Or twine their yellow tresses with the shy Forget-me-nots and fronds of maiden-hair— There had the priests appointed me to die. XXVI ‘But vainly doth a man contend with fate! My father had less pity on his son Than wild things of the woodland desolate. 'Tis said that ere the autumn day was done A great she-bear, that in these rocks did wonn, Beheld a sleeping babe she did convey Down to a den unlooked on of the sun, The cavern where her own soft litter lay. XXVII ‘And therein was I nurtured wondrously, So rumour saith: I know not of these things, For mortal men are ever wont to lie, Whene'er they speak of sceptre-bearing kings: I tell what I was told, for memory brings No record of those days, that are as deep Lost as the lullaby a mother sings In ears of children that are fallen on sleep. XXVIII Men say that now five autumn days had pass'd, When Agelaus, following a hurt deer, Trod soft on crackling acorns, and the mast That lay beneath the oak and beech-wood sere, In dread lest angry Pan were sleeping near, Then heard a cry from forth a cavern gray; And peeping round the fallen rocks in fear, Beheld where in the wild beast's tracks I lay. XXIX ‘So Agelaus bore me from the wild, Down to his hut; and with his children I Was nurtured, being, as was deem'd, the child Of Hermes, or some mountain deity; For these with the wild nymphs are wont to lie Within the holy caverns, where the bee Can scarcely find a darkling path to fly Through veils of bracken and the ivy-tree. XXX ‘So with the shepherds on the hills I stray'd, And drave the kine to feed where rivers run; And play'd upon the reed-pipe in the shade, And scarcely knew my manhood was begun, The pleasant years still passing one by one, Till I was chiefest of the mountain men, And climbed the peaks that take the snow and sun, And braved the anger'd lion in his den. XXXI ‘Now in my herd of kine was one more dear By far than all the rest, and fairer far; A milkwhite bull, the captive of my spear, And all the wondering shepherds called him Star: And still he led his fellows to the war, When the lean wolves against the herds came down, Then would he charge, and drive their hosts afar Beyond the pastures to the forests brown. XXXII ‘Now so it chanced that on an autumn morn, King Priam sought a goodly bull to slay In memory of his child, no sooner born Than midst the lonely mountains cast away, To die ere scarce he had beheld the day; And Priam's men came wandering afar To that green pool where by the flocks I lay, And straight they coveted the goodly Star, XXXIII ‘And drave him, no word spoken, to the town. One man mine arrow lit on, and he fell; His comrades held me off, and down and down, Through golden windings of the autumn dell, They spurr'd along the beast that loved me well, Till red were his white sides; I following, Wrath in my heart, their evil deeds to tell In Ilios, at the footstool of the king XXXIV ‘But ere they came to the god-builded wall, They spied a meadow by the water-side; And there the men of Troy were gathered all For joust and play; and Priam's sons defied All other men in all Mæonia wide To strive with them in boxing and in speed. Victorious with the shepherds had I vied, So boldly followed to that flowery mead. XXXV ‘Mæonia, Phrygia, Troia there were met, And there the king, child of Laomedon, Rich prizes for the vanquishers had set, Damsels, and robes, and cups that like the sun Shone, but the white bull was the chiefest one; And him the victor in the games should slay To Zeus, the king of gods, when all was done, And so with sacrifice should crown the day. XXXVI ‘Now it were over long, methinks, to tell The contest of the heady charioteers— Of them the goal that turn'd, and them that fell. But I outran the young men of my years, And with the bow did I out-do my peers, And wrestling; and in boxing, over-bold, I strove with Hector of the ashen spears; Yea, till the deep-voiced heralds bade us hold. XXXVII ‘Then Priam hail'd me winner of the day; Mine were the maid, the cup, and chiefest prize, Mine own fair milkwhite bull was mine to slay; But then the murmurs wax'd to angry cries, And hard men set on me in deadly wise, My brethren, though they knew it not; I turn'd, And fled unto the place of sacrifice, Where altars to the god of strangers burn'd. XXXVIII ‘At mine own funeral feast had I been slain, But, fearing Zeus, they halted for a space. And lo, Apollo's priestess with a train Of holy maidens came into that place, And far did she outshine the rest in grace. But in her eyes such dread was frozen then As glares eternal from the Gorgon's face Wherewith Athene quells the ranks of men. XXXIX ‘She was old Priam's daughter, long ago Apollo loved her, and did not deny His gifts—the things that are to be to know, The tongue of sooth-saying that cannot lie, And knowledge gave he of all birds that fly 'Neath heaven; and yet his prayer did she disdain. So he his gifts confounded utterly, And sooth she saith, but evermore in vain. XL ‘She, when her dark eyes fell on me, did stand At gaze a while, with wan lips murmuring; And then came nigh to me, and took my hand, And led me to the footstool of the king, And call'd me “brother”, and drew forth the ring That men had found upon me in the wild, For still I bore it as a precious thing, The token of a father to his child. XLI ‘This sign Cassandra show'd to Priam: straight The king wax'd pale, and ask'd what this might be? And she made answer, “Sir, and king, the fate That comes to all men born hath come on thee; This shepherd is thine own child verily: How like to thine his shape, his brow, his hands! Nay there is none but hath the eyes to see That here the child long lost to Troia stands”. XLII ‘Then the king bare me to his lofty hall, And there we feasted in much love and mirth; And Priam to the mountain sent for all That knew me, and the manner of my birth: And now among the great ones of the earth In royal robe and state behold me set, And one fell thing I fear not; even dearth, Whate'er the gods remember or forget. XLIII ‘My new rich life had grown a common thing, The pleasant years still passing one by one, When deep in Ida was I wandering The glare of well-built Ilios to shun, In summer, ere the day was wholly done; When I beheld a goodly prince—the hair To bloom upon his lip had scarce begun— The season when the flower of youth is fair. XLIV ‘Then knew I Hermes by his golden wand Wherewith he lulls the eyes of men to sleep; But, nodding with his brows, he bade me stand, And spake, “To-night thou hast a tryst to keep, With goddesses within the forest deep; And Paris, lovely things shalt thou behold, More fair than they for which men war and weep— Kingdoms, and fame, and victories, and gold. XLV ‘“For, lo! to-night within the forest dim Do Aphrodite and Athene meet, And Hera, who to thee shall bare each limb, Each grace from golden head to ivory feet. And thee, fair shepherd Paris, they entreat As thou 'mongst men art beauteous, to declare Which Queen of Queens immortal is most sweet, And doth deserve the meed of the most fair. XLVI ‘“For late between them rose a bitter strife In Peleus' halls upon his wedding day, When Peleus took him an immortal wife, And there was bidden all the gods' array, Save Discord only; yet she brought dismay, And cast an apple on the bridal board, With ‘Let the fairest bear the prize away’ Deep on its golden rind and gleaming, scored. XLVII ‘“Now in the sudden night, whenas the sun In Tethys' silver arms hath slept an hour, Shalt thou be had into the forest dun, And brought unto a dark enchanted bower, And there of goddesses behold the flower With very beauty burning in the night, And these will offer Wisdom, Love, and Power; Then, Paris, be thou wise, and choose aright!” XLVIII ‘He spake, and pass'd; and night without a breath, Without a star drew on; and now I heard The voice that in the springtime wandereth, The crying of Dame Hera's shadowy bird; And soon the silence of the trees was stirred By the wise fowl of Pallas; and anigh, More sweet than is a girl's first loving word, The doves of Aphrodite made reply. XLVIX ‘These voices did I follow through the trees, Threading the coppice 'neath a starless sky; When, lo! the very queen of goddesses, In golden beauty gleaming wondrously, Even she that hath the Heaven for canopy, And in the arms of mighty Zeus doth sleep— And then for dread methought that I must die, But Hera called me with soft voice and deep: L ‘“Paris, give me the prize, and thou shalt reign O'er many lordly peoples, far and wide; From them that till the black and crumbling plain, Where the sweet waters of Ægyptus glide, To those that on the northern marches ride; And the Ceteians, and the blameless men That round the rising-place of morn abide, And all the dwellers in the Asian fen. LI ‘“And I will love fair Ilios as I love Argos and rich Mycenae, that doth hoard Deep wealth; and I will make thee king above A hundred peoples; men shall call thee lord In tongues thou know'st not: thou shalt be adored With sacrifice, as are the gods divine, If only thou wilt speak a little word, And say the prize of loveliness is mine.” LII ‘Then, as I doubted, like a sudden flame Of silver came Athene, and methought Beholding her, how stately, as she came, That dim wood to a fragrant fane was wrought; So pure the warlike maiden seem'd, that nought But her own voice commanding made me raise Mine eyes to see her beauty, who besought In briefest words the guerdon of all praise. LIII ‘She spake: “Nor wealth nor crowns are in my gift; But wisdom, but the eyes that glance afar, But courage, and the spirit that is swift To cleave her path through all the waves of war; Endurance that the Fates can never mar; These, and my loving friendship,—these are thine, And these shall guide thee, steadfast as a star, If thou hast eyes to know the prize is mine.” LIV ‘Last, in a lovely mist of rosy fire, Came Aphrodite through the forest glade, The queen of all delight and all desire, More fair than when her naked foot she laid On the blind mere's wild wave that sank dismay'd, What time the sea grew smoother than a lake; I was too happy to be sore afraid. And like a song her voice was when she spake: LV ‘“Oh Paris, what is power? Tantalus And Sisyphus were kings long time ago, But now they lie in the Lake Dolorous, The hills of hell are noisy with their woe; Ay, swift the tides of empire ebb and flow, And that is quickly lost was hardly won, As Ilios herself o'erwell did know When high walls help'd not King Laomedon. LVI ‘“And what are strength and courage? for the child Of mighty Zeus, the strong man Herakles, Knew many days and evil, ere men piled The pyre in (CE)ta, where he got his ease In death, where all the ills of brave men cease. Nay, love I proffer thee; beyond the brine Of all the currents of the western seas, The fairest woman in the world is thine!” LVII ‘She spake, and touched the prize, and all grew dim, I heard no voice of anger'd deity, But round me did the night air swoon and swim; And, when I waken'd, lo! the sun was high, And in that place accursed did I lie, Where Agelaus found the naked child; Then with swift foot I did arise and fly Forth from the deeps of that enchanted wild. LVIII ‘And down I sped to Ilios—down the dell Where, years agone, the white bull guided me, And through green boughs beheld where foam'd and fell The merry waters of the western sea; Of love the sweet birds sang from sky and tree, And swift I reach'd the haven and the shore, And call'd my mariners, and follow'd free Where love might lead across the waters hoar. LIX ‘Three days with fair winds ran we; then we drave Before the north that made the long waves swell Round Malea; but hardly from the wave We 'scaped at Pylos, Nestor's citadel; And there the son of Neleus loved us well, And brought us to the high prince, Diocles, Who led us hither, and it thus befell That here, below thy roof, we sit at ease.’ LX Then all men gave the stranger thanks and praise, And Menelaus for red wine bade call; And the sun fell, and dark were all the ways; Then maidens set forth braziers in the hall, And heap'd them high with lighted brands withal But Helen pass'd, as doth the fading day Pass from the world, and softly left them all Loud o'er their wine amid the twilight gray. LXI So night drew on with rain, nor yet they ceased Within the hall to drink the gleaming wine, And late they pour'd the last cup of the feast, To Argus-bane, the messenger divine; And last, 'neath torches tall that smoke and shine, The maidens strew'd the beds with purple o'er, That Diocles and Paris might recline All night, beneath the echoing corridor. BOOK II The coming of Aphrodite, and how she told Helen that she must depart in company with Paris, but promised withal that Helen, having fallen into a deep sleep, should awake forgetful of her old life, and ignorant of her shame, and blameless of those evil deeds that the goddess thrust upon her. THE SPELL OF APHRODITE I Now in the upper chamber o'er the gate Lay Menelaus on his carven bed, And swift and sudden as the stroke of fate A deep sleep fell upon his weary head. But the soft-winged god with wand of lead Came not near Helen; wistful did she lie, Till dark should change to gray, and gray to red, And golden thronèd morn sweep o'er the sky. II Slow pass'd the heavy night: like one who fears The step of murder, she lies quivering, If any cry of the night bird she hears; And strains her eyes to mark some dreadful thing, If but the curtains of the window swing, Stirr'd by the breath of night; and still she wept As she were not the daughter of a king, And no strong king, her lord, beside her slept. III Now in that night, the folk who watch the night, Shepherds and fishermen, and they that ply Strange arts and seek their spells in the star-light, Beheld a marvel in the sea and sky, For all the waves of all the seas that sigh Between the straits of Hellé and the Nile, Flush'd with a flame of silver suddenly, From soft Cythera to the Cyprian isle. IV And Hesperus, the kindest star of heaven, That bringeth all things good, wax'd pale, and straight There fell a flash of white malignant levin Among the gleaming waters desolate; The lights of sea and sky did mix and mate And change to rosy flame, and thence did fly The lovely Queen of Love that turns to hate, Like summer lightnings 'twixt the sea and sky. V And now the bower of Helen fill'd with light, And now she knew the thing that she did fear Was close upon her (for the black of night Doth burn like fire, whene'er the gods are near); Then shone like flame each helm and shield and spear That hung within the chamber of the king. But he—though all the bower as day was clear— Slept as they sleep that know no wakening. VI But Helen leap'd from her fair carven bed Like some tormented thing that fear makes bold; And on the ground she beat her golden head And pray'd with bitter moanings manifold. Yet knew that she could never move the cold Heart of the lovely goddess, standing there, Her feet upon a little cloud, a fold Of silver cloud about her bosom bare. VII So stood Queen Aphrodite, as she stands Unmoved in her bright mansion, when in vain Some naked maiden stretches helpless hands And shifts the magic wheel, and burns the grain, And cannot win her lover back again, Nor her old heart of quiet any more, Where moonlight floods the dim Sicilian main, And the cool wavelets break along the shore. VIII Then Helen ceased from unavailing prayer, And rose and faced the goddess steadily, Till even the laughter-loving lady fair Half shrank before the anger of her eye, And Helen cried with an exceeding cry, ‘Why doth Zeus live, if we indeed must be No more than sullen spoils of destiny, And slaves of an adulteress like thee? IX ‘What wilt thou with me, mistress of all woe? Say, wilt thou bear me to another land Where thou hast other lovers? Rise and go Where dark the pine trees upon Ida stand, For there did one unloose thy girdle band; Or seek the forest where Adonis bled, Or wander, wander on the yellow sand, Where thy first lover strew'd thy bridal bed. X ‘Ah, thy first lover! who is first or last Of men and gods, unnumber'd and unnamed? Lover by lover in the race is pass'd, Lover by lover, outcast and ashamed. Oh, thou of many names, and evil famed! What wilt thou with me? What must I endure Whose soul, for all thy craft, is never tamed? Whose heart, for all thy wiles, is ever pure? XI ‘Behold, my heart is purer than the plume Upon the stainless pinions of the swan, And thou wilt smirch and stain it with the fume Of all thy hateful lusts Idalian. My name shall be a hissing that a man Shall smile to speak, and women curse and hate, And on my little child shall come a ban, And all my lofty home be desolate. XII ‘Is it thy will that like a golden cup From lip to lip of heroes I must go, And be but as a banner lifted up, To beckon where the winds of war may blow? Have I not seen fair Athens in her woe, And all her homes aflame from sea to sea, When my fierce brothers wrought her overthrow Because Athenian Theseus ravish'd me— XIII ‘Me, in my bloomless youth, a maiden child, From Artemis' pure altars and her fane, And bare me, with Pirithous the wild To rich Aphidna? Many a man was slain, And wet with blood the wide Athenian plain, And fired was many a goodly temple then, But fire nor blood can purify the stain Nor make my name reproachless among men.’ XIV Then Helen ceased, her passion like a flame That slays the thing it lives by, blazed and fell, As faint as waves at dawn, though fierce they came, By night to storm some rocky citadel; For Aphrodite answer'd—like a spell Her voice makes strength of mortals pass away— ‘Dost thou not know that I have loved thee well, And never loved thee better than to-day? XV ‘Behold, thine eyes are wet, thy cheeks are wan, Yet art thou born of an immortal sire, The child of Nemesis and of the Swan; Thy veins should run with ichor and with fire. Yet this is thy delight and thy desire, To love a mortal lord, a mortal child; To live, unpraised of lute, unhymn'd of lyre, As any woman pure and undefiled. XVI ‘Thou art the toy of gods, an instrument Wherewith all mortals shall be plagued or blest, Even at my pleasure; yea thou shalt be bent This way and that, howe'er it like me best: And following thee, as tides the moon, the west Shall flood the eastern coasts with waves of war, And thy vex'd soul shall scarcely be at rest, Even in the havens where the deathless are. XVII ‘The instruments of men are blind and dumb; And this one gift I give thee, to be blind And heedless of the thing that is to come, And ignorant of that which is behind; Bearing an innocent forgetful mind In each new fortune till I visit thee And stir thy heart, as lightning and the wind Bear fire and tumult through a sleeping sea. XVIII ‘Thou shalt forget Hermione; forget Thy lord, thy lofty palace, and thy kin; Thy hand within a stranger's shalt thou set, And follow him, nor deem it any sin; And many a strange land wand'ring shalt thou win, And thou shalt come to an unhappy town, And twenty long years shalt thou dwell therein, Before the Argives mar its towery crown. XIX ‘And of thine end I speak not; but thy name— Thy name which thou lamentest—that shall be A song in all men's speech, a tongue of flame Between the burning lips of Poesy; And the nine daughters of Mnemosyne, With Prince Apollo, leader of the nine, Shall make thee deathless in their minstrelsy! Yea, for thou shalt outlive the race divine, XX ‘The race of gods, for like the sons of men We gods have but our season, and go by; And Cronos pass'd, and Uranus, and then Shall Zeus and all his children utterly Pass, and new gods be born, and reign, and die— But thee shall lovers worship evermore What gods soe'er usurp the changeful sky, Or flit forsaken to the changeless shore. XXI ‘Now sleep and dream not, sleep the long day through, And the brief watches of the summer night; And then go forth amid the flowers and dew, Where the red rose of dawn outburns the white. There shalt thou learn my mercy and my might Between the drowsy lily and the rose; There shalt thou spell the meaning of delight, And know such gladness as a goddess knows!’ XXII Then Sleep came floating from the Lemnian isle, And over Helen crush'd his poppy crown, Her soft lids waver'd for a little while, Then on her carven bed she laid her down, And Sleep, the comforter of king and clown, Kind Sleep the sweetest, near akin to Death, Held her as close as Death doth men that drown, So close that none might hear her inward breath— XXIII So close no man might tell she was not dead! And then the goddess took her zone—where lies All her enchantment, love and lustihead, And the glad converse that beguiles the wise, And grace the very gods may not despise, And sweet desire that doth the whole world move— And therewith touch'd she Helen's sleeping eyes And made her lovely as the queen of love. XXIV Then round her throat she clasp'd an amulet A ruby graven with a wondrous spell, That in a coil of burning gold was set, And thence the blood-red drops for ever fell, And strangely vanish'd; (thus old stories tell) Nor mark'd her white breast with their over-flow— A symbol of men's blood, that still must well, Where Helen pass'd, nor stain her feet of snow. XXV Then laughter-loving Aphrodite went To far Idalia, over land and sea, And scarce the fragrant cedar-branches bent Beneath her footsteps, faring daintily; And in Idalia the Graces three Anointed her with oil ambrosial— So to her house in Sidon wended she To mock the prayers of lovers when they call. XXVI And all day long the incense and the smoke Lifted, and fell, and soft and slowly roll'd; And many a hymn and musical awoke Between the pillars of her house of gold, And rose-crown'd girls, and fair boys linen-stoled, Did sacrifice her fragrant courts within, And in dark chapels wrought rites manifold The loving favour of the queen to win. XXVII But Menelaus, waking suddenly, Beheld the dawn was white, the day was near, And rose, and kiss'd fair Helen; no good-bye He spake, and never mark'd a fallen tear— Men know not when they part for many a year— He grasp'd a bronze-shod lance in either hand, And merrily went forth to drive the deer, With Paris, through the dewy morning land. XXIII So up the steep sides of Taygetus They fared, and to the windy hollows came; While from the streams of deep Oceanus The sun arose, and on the fields did flame; And through wet glades the huntsmen drave the game, And with them Paris sway'd an ashen spear, Heavy, and long, and shod with bronze to tame The mountain-dwelling goats and forest deer. XXIX Now in a copse a mighty boar there lay, For through the boughs the wet winds never blew, Nor lit the bright sun on it with his ray, Nor rain might pierce the woven branches through; But leaves had fallen deep the lair to strew: Then questing of the hounds and men's foot-fall Aroused the boar, and forth he sprang to view, With eyes that burn'd, at bay, before them all. XXX Then Paris was the first to rush on him, With spear aloft in his strong hand to smite, And through the monster pierced the point; and dim The flame fell in his eyes, and all his might With his last cry went forth; forgetting fight, Forgetting strength, he fell, and gladly then They gather'd round, and dealt with him aright, Then left his body with the serving men. XXXI Now birds were long awake, that with their cry Were wont to waken Helen; and the dew Where fell the sun upon the lawn was dry, And all the summer land was glad anew; And maidens' footsteps rang the palace through, And with their footsteps chimed their happy song. And one to other cried, ‘A marvel new That soft-wing'd sleep hath held the queen so long!’ XXXII Then Phylo brought the child Hermione, And close unto her mother's side she crept, And o'er her god-like beauty tumbled she, Chiding her sweetly that so late she slept, And babbling still a merry coil she kept; But like a woman stiff beneath her shroud Lay Helen; till the young child fear'd and wept, And ran, and to her nurses cried aloud. XXXIII Then came the women quickly, and in dread Gather'd round Helen, but might naught avail To wake her; moveless as a maiden dead That Artemis hath slain, yet nowise pale, She lay; but Æthra did begin the wail, And all the women with sad voice replied, Who deem'd her pass'd unto the poplar vale Wherein doth dread Persephone abide. XXXIV Ah! slowly went the miserable day In the rich house that late was full of pride; Till the sun fell, and all the paths were gray, And Menelaus from the mountain-side Came, and through palace doors all open wide Rang the wild dirge that told him of the thing That Helen, that the queen had strangely died. Then on his threshold fell he grovelling, XXXV And cast the dust upon his yellow hair, And, but that Paris leap'd and held his hand, His hunter's knife would he have clutch'd, and there Had slain himself, to follow to that land Where flit the ghosts of men, a shadowy band That have no more delight, no more desire, When once the flesh hath burn'd down like a brand, Drench'd by the dark wine on the funeral pyre: XXXVI So on the ashen threshold lay the king, And all within the house was chill and drear, The women watchers gather'd in a ring About the bed of Helen and her bier; And much had they to tell, and much to hear, Of happy queens and fair, untimely dead— Such joy they took amid their evil cheer— While the low thunder muttered overhead. BOOK III The flight of Helen and Paris from Lacedæmon, and of what things befell them in their voyaging, and how they came to Troy. THE FLIGHT OF HELEN I The grey Dawn's daughter, rosy Morn awoke In old Tithonus' arms, and suddenly Let harness her swift steeds beneath the yoke, And drave her shining chariot through the sky. Then men might see the flocks of Thunder fly, All gold and rose, the azure pastures through, What time the lark was carolling on high Above the gardens drench'd with rainy dew. II But Aphrodite sent a slumber deep On all in the king's palace, young and old; And one by one the women fell asleep— Their lamentable tales left half untold— Before the dawn, when folk wax weak and cold. But Helen waken'd with the shining morn, Forgetting quite her sorrows manifold, And light of heart as was the day new-born. III She had no memory of unhappy things, She knew not of the evil days to come; Forgotten were her ancient wanderings, And as Lethæan waters wholly numb The sense of spirits in Elysium, That no remembrance may their bliss alloy, Even so the rumour of her days was dumb, And all her heart was ready for new joy. IV The young day knows not of an elder dawn, Joys of old noons, old sorrows of the night; And so from Helen was the past withdrawn, Her lord, her child, her home forgotten quite, Lost in the marvel of a new delight: She was as one who knows he shall not die, When earthly colours melt into the bright Pure splendour of his immortality. V Then Helen rose, and all her body fair She bath'd in the spring water, pure and cold, And with her hand bound up her shining hair And clothed her in the raiment that of old Athene wrought with marvels manifold, A bridal gift from an immortal hand, And all the front was clasp'd with clasps of gold, And for the girdle was a golden band. VI Next from her upper chamber silently When Helen, moving like a morning dream. She did not know the golden roof, the high Walls, and the shields that on the pillars gleam, Only she heard the murmur of the stream That waters all the garden's wide expanse; This song, and cry of singing birds, did seem To guide her feet as music guides the dance. VII The music drew her on to the glad air From forth the chamber of enchanted death, And lo! the world was waking everywhere; The wind went by, a cool delicious breath, Like that which in the gardens wandereth, The golden gardens of the Hesperides; And in its song unheard of things it saith, The myriad marvels of the fairy seas. VIII So through the courtyard to the garden close Went Helen, where she heard the murmuring Of water 'twixt the lily and the rose; For thereby doth a double fountain spring. To one stream do the women pitchers bring By Menelaus' gates, at close of day; The other through the close doth shine and sing, Then to the swift Eurotas fleets away. IX And Helen sat her down upon the grass, And pluck'd the little daisies white and red, And toss'd them where the running waters pass, To watch them racing from the fountain-head, And whirl'd about where little streams dispread; And still with merry birds the garden rang, And marry, marry, in their song they said, Or so do maids interpret that they sang. X Then stoop'd she down, and watch'd the crystal stream, And fishes poising where the waters ran, And lo! upon the glass a golden gleam, And purple as of robes Sidonian, Then, sudden turning, she beheld a man, That knelt beside her; as her own face fair Was his, and o'er his shoulders for a span Fell the bright tresses of his yellow hair. XI Then either look'd on other with amaze As each had seen a god; for no long while They marvell'd, but as in the first of days, The first of men and maids did meet and smile, And Aphrodite did their hearts beguile, So hands met hands, lips lips, with no word said Were they enchanted 'neath that leafy aisle, And silently were woo'd, betroth'd, and wed. XII Ah, slowly did their silence wake to words That scarce had more of meaning than the song Pour'd forth of the innumerable birds That fill the palace gardens all day long; So innocent, so ignorant of wrong, Was she, so happy each in other's eyes; Thus wrought the mighty goddess that is strong, Even to make naught the wisdom of the wise. XIII Now in the midst of that enchanted place Right gladly had they linger'd all day through, And fed their love upon each other's face, But Aphrodite had a counsel new, And silently to Paris' side she drew, In guise of Æthra, whispering that the day Sped on, while his ship waited, and his crew Impatient, in the narrow Gythian bay. XIV For thither had she brought them by her skill; But Helen saw her not-nay, who can see A goddess come or go against her will? Then Paris whisper'd, ‘Come, ah, love, with me! Come to a shore beyond the barren sea; There doth the bridal crown await thy head, And there shall all the land be glad of thee!’ Then, like a child, she follow'd where he led. XV For, like a child's her gentle heart was glad. So through the courtyard pass'd they to the gate; And even there, as Aphrodite bade, The steeds of Paris and the chariots wait; Then to the well-wrought car he led her straight, And grasped the shining whip and golden rein, And swift they drave until the day was late By clear Eurotas through the fruitful plain. XVI But now within the halls the magic sleep Was broken, and men sought them everywhere; Yet Aphrodite cast a cloud so deep About their chariot none might see them there. And strangely did they hear the trumpets blare, And noise of racing wheels; yet saw they nought: Then died the sounds upon the distant air, And safe they won the haven that they sought. XVII Beneath a grassy cliff, beneath the down, Where swift Eurotas mingles with the sea, There climb'd the grey walls of a little town, The sleepy waters wash'd it languidly, For tempests in that haven might not be. The isle across the inlet guarded all, And the shrill winds that roam the ocean free Broke and were broken on the rocky wall. XVIII Then Paris did a point of hunting blow, Nor yet the sound had died upon the hill When round the isle they spied a scarlet prow, And oars that flash'd into that haven still; The oarsmen bending forward with a will, And swift their black ship to the haven-side They brought, and steer'd her in with goodly skill, And bare on board the strange Achæan bride. XIX Now while the swift ship through the waters clave, All happy things that in the waters dwell, Arose and gamboll'd on the glassy wave, And Nereus led them with his sounding shell: Yea, the sea-nymphs, their dances weaving well, In the green water gave them greeting free. Ah, long light linger'd, late the darkness fell, That night, upon the isle of Cranaë. XX And Hymen shook his fragrant torch on high, Till all its waves of smoke and tongues of flame, Like clouds of rosy gold fulfill'd the sky; And all the Nereids from the waters came, Each maiden with a musical sweet name; Doris, and Doto, and Amphithoë; And their shrill bridal song of love and shame Made music in the silence of the sea. XXI For this was like that night of summer weather, When mortal men and maidens without fear, And forest-nymphs, and forest-gods together, Do worship Pan in the long twilight clear. And Artemis this one night spares the deer, And every cave and dell, and every grove Is glad with singing soft and happy cheer, With laughter, and with dalliance, and with love. XXII Now when the golden-thronèd Dawn arose To waken gods and mortals out of sleep, Queen Aphrodite sent the wind that blows From fairy gardens of the western deep. The sails are spread, the oars of Paris leap Past many a headland, many a haunted fane: And, merrily all from isle to isle they sweep O'er the wet ways across the barren plain. XXIII By many an island fort, and many a haven They sped, and many a crowded arsenal: They saw the loves of gods and men engraven On friezes of Astarte's temple wall. They heard that ancient shepherd Proteus call His flock from forth the green and tumbling lea, And saw white Thetis with her maidens all Sweep up to high Olympus from the sea. XXIV They saw the vain and weary toil of men, The ships that win the rich man all he craves; They pass'd the red-prow'd barks Egyptian, And heard afar the moaning of the slaves Pent in the dark hot hold beneath the waves; And scatheless the Shardana's fleets among They sail'd; by men that sow the sea with graves, Bearing black fate to folk of alien tongue. XXV Then all day long a rolling cloud of smoke Would hang on the sea-limits, faint and far, But through the night the beacon-flame upbroke From some rich island-town begirt with war; And all these things could neither make nor mar The joy of lovers wandering, but they Sped happily, and heedless of the star That hung o'er their glad haven, far away. XXVI The fisher-sentinel upon the height Watch'd them with vacant eyes, and little knew They bore the fate of Troy; to him the bright Plashed waters, with the silver shining through When tunny shoals came cruising in the blue, Was more than love that doth the world unmake; And listless gazed he as the gulls that flew And shriek'd and chatter'd in the vessel's wake. XXVII So the wind drave them, and the waters bare Across the great green plain unharvested, Till through an after-glow they knew the fair Faint rose of snow on distant Ida's head. And swifter then the joyous oarsmen sped; But night was ended, and the waves were fire Beneath the fleet feet of a dawning red Or ere they won the land of their desire. XXVIII Now when the folk about the haven knew The scarlet prow of Paris, swift they ran And the good ship within the haven drew, And merrily their welcoming began. But none the face of Helen dared to scan; Their bold eyes fell before they had their fill, For all men deem'd her that Idalian Who loved Anchises on the lonely hill. XXIX But when her sweet smile and her gentleness And her kind speech had won them from dismay, They changed their minds, and 'gan the gods to bless Who brought to Ilios that happy day. And all the folk fair Helen must convey, Crown'd like a bride, and clad with flame-hued pall, Through the rich plain, along the water-way Right to the great gates of the Ilian wall. XXX And through the vines they pass'd, where old and young Had no more heed of the glad vintaging, But all unpluck'd the purple clusters hung; Nor more of Linus did the minstrel sing, For he and all the folk were following, Wine-stain'd and garlanded, in merry bands; Like men when Dionysus came as king, And led his revel from the sun-burnt lands, XXXI So from afar the music and the shout Roll'd up to Ilios and the Scæan gate; And at the sound the city folk came out And bore sweet Helen—such a fairy weight As none might deem the burden of Troy's fate— Across the threshold of the town, and all Flock'd with her, where King Priam sat in state, Girt by his elders, on the Ilian wall. XXXII No man but knew him by his crown of gold, And golden-studded sceptre, and his throne; Ay, strong he seem'd as those great kings of old, Whose image is eternal on the stone Won from the mounds that once were Babylon; But kind of mood was he withal, and mild, And when his eyes on Argive Helen shone, He loved her as a father doth a child. XXXIII Round him were set his peers, as Panthous, Antenor, and Agenor, hardly gray, Scarce touch'd as yet with age, nor garrulous As are cicalas on a sunny day: Such might they be when years had slipp'd away, And made them over-weak for war or joy, Content to watch the Leaguer as it lay Beside the ships, beneath the walls of Troy. XXXIV Then Paris had an easy tale to tell, Which then might win upon men's wond'ring ears, Who deem'd that gods with mortals deign to dwell, And that the water of the west enspheres The happy Isles that know not death nor tears; Yea, and though monsters do these islands guard, Yet men within their coasts had dwelt for years Uncounted, with a strange love for reward. XXXV And there had Paris ventured: so said he— Had known the Sirens' song, and Circe's wile; And in a cove of that Hesperian sea Had found a maiden on a lonely isle; A sacrifice, if so men might beguile The wrath of some beast-god they worshipp'd there. But Paris, 'twixt the sea and strait defile, Had slain the beast, and won the woman fair. XXXVI Then while the happy people cried ‘Well done’, And Priam's heart was melted by the tale— For Paris was his best-belov(e`)d son— Came a wild woman, with wet eyes, and pale Sad face, men look'd on when she cast her veil, Not gladly; and none mark'd the thing she said, Yet could not 'scape her long and boding wail That follow'd still, however fleet they fled. XXXVII She was the priestess of Apollo's fane, Cassandra, and the god of prophecy Spurr'd her to speak and rent her! but in vain She toss'd her wasted arms against the sky, And brake her golden circlet angrily, And shriek'd that they had brought within the gate Helen, a serpent at their hearts to lie! Helen, a hell of people, king, and state! XXXVIII But ere the God had left her; ere she fell And foam'd among her maidens on the ground, The air was ringing with a merry swell Of flute, and pipe, and every sweetest sound, In Aphrodite's fane; and all around Were roses toss'd beneath the dusky green Of that high roof, and Helen there was crown'd The goddess of the Trojans, and their queen. BOOK IV How Helen was made an outcast by the Trojan women, and how Œnone, the old love of Paris, sent her son Corythus to him as her messenger, and how Paris slew him unwittingly; and of the curses of Œnone, and the coming of the Argive host against Troy. THE DEATH OF CORYTHUS I For long in Troia was there peace and mirth, The pleasant hours still passing one by one; And Helen joy'd at each fresh morning's birth, And almost wept at setting of the sun, For sorrow that the happy day was done; Nor dream'd of years when she should hate the light, And mourn afresh for every day begun, Nor fare abroad save shamefully by night. II And Paris was not one to backward cast A fearful glance, nor pluck sour fruits of sin; But still would seize all pleasures while they last, Nor boded evil ere ill days begin. Nay, nor lamented much when caught therein, In each adventure always finding joy, And hopeful still through waves of war to win By strength of Hector, and the star of Troy. III Now as the storms drive white sea-birds afar Within green upland glens to seek for rest, So rumours pale of an approaching war Were blown across the islands from the west: For Agamemnon summon'd all the best From towns and tribes he ruled, and gave command That free men all should gather at his hest Through coasts and islets of the Argive land. IV Sidonian merchant-men had seen the fleet Black war-galleys that sped from town to town; Had heard the hammers of the bronze-smiths beat The long day through, and when the sun went down; And thin, said they, would show the leafy crown On many a sacred mountain-peak in spring, For men had fell'd the pine-trees tall and brown To fashion them curved ships for seafaring. V And still the rumour grew; for heralds came, Old men from Argos, bearing holy boughs, Demanding great atonement for the shame And sore despite done Menelaus' house; But homeward soon they turn'd their scarlet prows, And all their weary voyaging was vain; For Troy had bound herself with awful vows To cleave to Helen till the walls were ta'en. VI And now, like swallows ere the winter weather, The women in shrill groups were gathering, With eager tongues still communing together, And many a taunt at Helen would they fling, Ay, through her innocence she felt the sting, And shamed was now her gentle face and sweet, For e'en the children evil songs would sing To mock her as she hasted down the street. VII Also the men who worshipp'd her of old As she had been a goddess from above, Gazed at her now with lustful eyes and bold, As she were nought but Paris' light-o'-love; And though in truth they still were proud enough, Of that fair gem in their old city set, Yet well she knew that wanton word and scoff Went round the camp-fire when the warriors met. VIII There came a certain holiday when Troy Was wont to send her noble matrons all, Young wives and old, with clamour and with joy, To clothe Athene in her temple hall, And robe her in a stately broider'd pall. But now they drove fair Helen from their train, ‘Better’, they scream'd, ‘to cast her from the wall, Than mock the gods with offerings in vain’. IX One joy she had, that Paris yet was true, Ay, fickle Paris, true unto the end; And in the court of Ilios were two Kind hearts, still eager Helen to defend, And help and comfort in all need to lend— The gentle Hector with soft speech and mild, And the old king that ever was her friend, And loved her as a father doth his child. X These, though they knew not all, these blamed her not, But cast the heavy burden on the god, Whose wrath, they deem'd, had verily waxed hot Against the painful race on earth that trod. And in god's hand was Helen but the rod To scourge a people that, in unknown wise, Had vex'd the far Olympian abode With secret sin or stinted sacrifice. XI The days grew into months, and months to years, And still the Argive army did delay, Till folk in Troia half forgot their fears, And almost as of old were glad and gay; And men and maids on Ida dared to stray, But Helen dwelt within her inmost room, And there from dawning to declining day, Wrought at the patient marvels of her loom. XII Yet even there in peace she might not be: There was a nymph, (CE)none, in the hills, The daughter of a river-god was she, Of Cebren—that the mountain silence fills With murmur'd music, for the countless rills Of Ida meet him, dancing to the plain— Her Paris wooed, yet ignorant of ills, Among the shepherd's huts, nor wooed in vain. XIII Nay, summer often found them by the fold In these glad days, ere Paris was a king, And oft the autumn, in his car of gold, Had pass'd them, merry at the vintaging: And scarce they felt the breath of the white wing Of winter, in the cave where they would lie On beds of heather by the fire, till spring Should crown them with her buds in passing by. XIV For elbow-deep their flowery bed was strown With fragrant leaves and with crush'd asphodel; And sweetly still the shepherd-pipe made moan, And many a tale of love they had to tell— How Daphnis loved the strange, shy maiden well, And how she loved him not, and how he died, And oak-trees moan'd his dirge, and blossoms fell Like tears from lindens by the water-side! XV But colder, fleeter than the winter's wing, Time pass'd, and Paris changed; and now no more (CE)none heard him on the mountain sing; Not now she met him in the forest hoar. Nay, but she knew that on an alien shore An alien love he sought; yet was she strong To live, who deem'd that even as of yore In days to come might Paris love her long. XVI For dark (CE)none from her father drew A power beyond all price; the gift to deal With wounded men, though now the dreadful dew Of death anoint them, and the secret seal Of fate be set on them; these might she heal; And thus (CE)none trusted still to save Her lover at the point of death, and steal His life from Helen, and the amorous grave. XVII And she had borne, though Paris knew it not, A child, fair Corythus, to be her shame. And still she mused, whenas her heart was hot, ‘He hath no child by that Achæan dame:’ But when her boy unto his manhood came, Then sorer yet (CE)none did repine, And bade him ‘fare to Ilios, and claim Thy father's love, and all that should be thine!’ XVIII Therewith a golden bodkin from her hair She drew, and from a green-tress'd birchen tree She pluck'd a strip of smooth white bark and fair, And many signs and woful gravèd she, A message of the evil things to be. Then deftly closed the birch-bark, fold on fold, And bound the tokens well and cunningly, Three times and four times, with a thread of gold. XIX ‘Give these to Argive Helen's hand’, she cried: And so embraced her child, and with no fear Beheld him leaping down the mountain-side, Like a king's son that goes to hunt the deer, Clad softly, and in either hand a spear; With two swift-footed hounds that follow'd him, So leap'd he down the grassy slopes and sheer, And won the precinct of the forest dim. XX He trod that ancient path his sire had trod, Far, far below he saw the sea, the town; He moved as light as an immortal god, From mansions in Olympus gliding down. He left the shadow of the forest brown, And through the shallow waters did he cross, And stood, ere twilight fell, within the crown Of towers, the sacred keep of Ilios. XXI Now folk that mark'd him hasting deem'd that he Had come to tell the host was on its way; As one that from the hills had seen the sea Beclouded with the Danaan array, So straight to Paris' house with no delay They led him, and did eagerly await Within the forecourt, in the twilight gray, To hear some certain message of their fate. XXII Now Paris was asleep upon his bed, Tired with a listless day; but all along The palace chambers Corythus was led, And still he heard a music, shrill and strong, That seem'd to clamour of an old-world wrong, And hearts a long time broken; last they came To Helen's bower, the fountain of the song That cried so loud against an ancient shame. XXIII And Helen fared before a mighty loom, And sang, and cast her shuttle wrought of gold, And forth unto the utmost secret room The wave of her wild melody was roll'd; And still she fashion'd marvels manifold, Strange shapes of fish and serpent, bear and swan, The loves of the immortal gods of old, Wherefrom the peoples of the world began. XXIV Now Helen met the stranger graciously With gentle speech, and bade set forth a chair Well wrought of cedar wood and ivory That wise Icmalius had fashion'd fair. But when young Corythus had drunk the rare Wine of the princes, and had broken bread, Then Helen took the word, and bade declare His instant tidings; and he spake, and said, XXV ‘Lady and Queen, I have a secret word, And bear a token sent to none but thee; Also I bring a message to my lord That spoken to another may not be.’ Then Helen gave a sign unto her three Bower-maidens, and they went forth from that place; Silent they went; and all forebodingly, They left the man and woman face to face. XXVI Then from his breast the birchen scroll he took And gave to Helen; and she read therein: ‘Oh thou that on those hidden runes dost look, Hast thou forgotten quite thine ancient sin, Thy lord, thy lofty palace, and thy kin— Even as thy love forgets the words he spoke The strong oath broken one weak heart to win, The lips that kiss'd him, and the heart that broke? XXVII ‘Nay, but methinks thou shalt not quite forget The curse wherewith I curse thee till I die; The tears that on the wood-nymph's cheeks are wet, Shall burn thy hateful beauty deathlessly, Nor shall god raise up seed to thee; but I Have borne thy love this messenger: my son, Who yet shall make him glad, for time goes by And soon shall thine enchantments all be done: XXVIII ‘Ay, soon 'twixt me and death must be his choice, And little in that hour will Paris care For thy sweet lips, and for thy singing voice, Thine arms of ivory, thy golden hair. Nay, me will he embrace, and will not spare, But bid the folk that hate thee have their joy, And give thee to the mountain beasts to tear, Or burn thy body on a tower of Troy.’ XXIX Even as she read, by Aphrodite's will The cloud roll'd back from Helen's memory: She saw the city of the rifted hill, Fair Lacedæmon, 'neath her mountain high; She knew the swift Eurotas running by To mix his sacred waters with the sea, And from the garden close she heard the cry Of her beloved child, Hermione. XXX Then instantly the horror of her shame Fell on her, and she saw the coming years; Famine, and fire, and plague, and all men's blame, The wounds of warriors and the women's fears; And through her heart her sorrow smote like spears, And in her soul she knew the utmost smart Of wives left lonely, sires bereaved, the tears Of maidens desolate, of loves that part. XXXI She drain'd the dregs out of the cup of hate; The bitterness of sorrow, shame, and scorn; Where'er the tongues of mortals curse their fate, She saw herself an outcast and forlorn; And hating sore the day that she was born, Down in the dust she cast her golden head; There with rent raiment and fair tresses torn, At feet of Corythus she lay for dead. XXXII But Corythus, beholding her sweet face, And her most lovely body lying low, Had pity on her grief and on her grace, Nor heeded now she was his mother's foe, But did what might be done to ease her woe, While, as he thought, with death for life she strove, And loosed the necklet round her neck of snow, As who that saw had deem'd, with hands of love. XXXIII And there was one that saw: for Paris woke Half-deeming and half-dreaming that the van Of the great Argive host had scared the folk, And down the echoing corridor he ran To Helen's bower, and there beheld the man That kneel'd beside his lady lying there: No word he spake, but drove his sword a span Through Corythus' fair neck and cluster'd hair. XXXIV Then fell fair Corythus, as falls the tower An earthquake shaketh from a city's crown; Or as a tall white fragrant lily-flower A child hath in the garden trampled down; Or as a pine-tree in the forest brown, Fell'd by the sea-rovers on mountain lands, When they to harry foreign folk are boune, Taking their own lives in their reckless hands. XXXV But still in Paris did his anger burn, And still his sword was lifted up to slay, When, like a lot leap'd forth of fate's own urn, He mark'd the graven tokens where they lay, 'Mid Helen's hair in golden disarray, And looking on them, knew what he had done, Knew what dire thing had fallen on that day— Knew how a father's hand had slain a son. XXXVI Then Paris on his face fell grovelling, And the night gather'd, and the silence grew Within the darkened chamber of the king. But Helen rose, and a sad breath she drew, And her new woes came back to her anew: Ah, where is he but knows the bitter pain To wake from dreams, and find his sorrow true, And his ill life returned to him again! XXXVII She needed none to tell her whence it fell, The thick red rain upon the marble floor: She knew that in her bower she might not dwell, Alone with her own heart for ever more; No sacrifice, no spell, no priestly lore Could banish quite the melancholy ghost Of Corythus; a herald sent before Them that should die for her, a dreadful host. XXXVIII But slowly Paris raised him from the earth, And read her face, and knew that she knew all, No more her eyes, in tenderness or mirth, Should answer his, in bower or in hall. Nay, love had fallen when his child did fall, The stream love cannot cross ran 'twixt them red; No more was Helen his, whate'er befall, Not though the goddess drove her to his bed. XXXIX This word he spake, ‘the fates are hard on us’— Then bade the women do what must be done To the fair body of dead Corythus. And then he hurl'd into the night alone, Wailing unto the spirit of his son, That somewhere in dark mist and sighing wind Must dwell, nor yet to Hades had it won, Nor quite had left the world of men behind. XL But wild (CE)none by the mountain-path Saw not her son returning to the wold, And now was she in fear, and now in wrath She cried, ‘He hath forgot the mountain fold, And goes in Ilios with a crown of gold:’ But even then she heard men's axes smite Against the beeches slim and ash-trees old, These ancient trees wherein she did delight. XLI Then she arose and silently as Sleep, Unseen she follow'd the slow-rolling wain, Beneath an ashen sky that 'gan to weep, Too heavy laden with the latter rain; And all the folk of Troy upon the plain She found, all gather'd round a funeral pyre, And thereon lay her son, her darling slain, The goodly Corythus, her heart's desire! XLII Among the spices and fair robes he lay, His arm beneath his head, as though he slept. For so the goddess wrought that no decay, No loathly thing about his body crept; And all the people look'd on him and wept, And, weeping, Paris lit the pine-wood dry, And lo, a rainy wind arose and swept The flame and fragrance far into the sky. XLIII But when the force of flame was burning low, Then did they drench the pyre with ruddy wine, And the white bones of Corythus bestow Within a gold cruse, wrought with many a sign, And wrapp'd the cruse about with linen fine And bare it to the tomb: when, lo, the wild (CE)none sprang, with burning eyes divine, And shriek'd unto the slayer of her child: XLIV ‘Oh thou, that like a god art sire and slayer, That like a god, dost give and take away! Methinks that even now I hear the prayer Thou shalt beseech me with, some later day; When all the world to thy dim eyes grows gray, And thou shalt crave thy healing at my hand. Then gladly will I mock, and say thee nay, And watch thine hours run down like running sand! XLV ‘Yea, thou shalt die, and leave thy love behind, And little shall she love thy memory! But, oh ye foolish people, deaf and blind, What death is coming on you from the sea?’ Then all men turned, and lo, upon the lee Of Tenedos, beneath the driving rain, The countless Argive ships were racing free, The wind and oarsmen speeding them amain. XLVI Then from the barrow and the burial, Back like a bursting torrent all men fled Back to the city and the sacred wall. But Paris stood, and lifted not his head. Alone he stood, and brooded o'er the dead, As broods a lion, when a shaft hath flown, And through the strong heart of his mate hath sped, Then will he face the hunters all alone. XLVII But soon the voice of men on the sea-sand Came round him; and he turned, and gazed, and lo! The Argive ships were dashing on the strand: Then stealthily did Paris bend his bow, And on the string he laid a shaft of woe, And drew it to the point, and aim'd it well. Singing it sped, and through a shield did go, And from his barque Protesilaus fell. XLIII Half gladdened by the omen, through the plain Went Paris to the walls and mighty gate, And little heeded he that arrowy rain The Argive bowmen shower'd in helpless hate Nay; not yet feather'd was the shaft of fate, His bane, the gift of mighty Heracles To Philoctetes, lying desolate, Within a far off island of the seas. BOOK V The war round Troy, and how many brave men fell, and chiefly Sarpedon, Patroclus, Hector, Memnon, and Achilles. The coming of the Amazons, and the wounding of Paris, and his death, and concerning the good end that Œnone made. THE WAR I For ten long years the Argive leaguer lay Round Priam's folk, and wrought them many woes, While, as a lion crouch'd above his prey, The Trojans yet made head against their foes; And as the swift sea-water ebbs and flows Between the Straits of Hellé and the main, Even so the tide of battle sank and rose, And fill'd with waifs of war the Ilian plain. II And horse on horse was driven, as wave on wave; Like rain upon the deep the arrows fell; And like the wind, the war-cry of the brave Rang out above the battle's ebb and swell, And long the tale of slain, and sad to tell; Yet seem'd the end scarce nearer than of yore, When nine years pass'd and still the citadel Frown'd on the Argive huts beside the shore. III And still the watchers on the city's crown Afar from sacred Ilios might spy The flame from many a fallen subject town Flare on the starry verges of the sky, And still from rich Mæonia came the cry Of cities sack'd where'er Achilles led. Yet none the more men deem'd the end was nigh While knightly Hector fought unvanquished. IV But ever as each dawn bore grief afar, And further back, wax'd Paris glad and gay, And on the fringes of the cloud of war His arrows, like the lightning, still would play; Yet fled he Menelaus on a day, And there had died, but Aphrodite's power Him in a golden cloud did safe convey Within the walls of Helen's fragrant bower. V But she, in longing for her lord and home, And scorn of her wild lover, did withdraw From all men's eyes: but in the night would roam Till drowsy watchmen of the city saw A shadowy shape that chill'd the night with awe, Treading the battlements; and like a ghost, She stretch'd her lovely arms without a flaw, In shame and longing, to the Argive host. VI But all day long within her bower she wept, Still dreaming of the dames renown'd of old, Whom hate or love of the Immortals swept Within the toils of Atê manifold; And most she loved the ancient tales that told How the great gods, at length to pity stirr'd, Changed Niobe upon the mountains cold, To a cold stone; and Procne to a bird, VII And Myrrha to an incense-breathing tree;— ‘And ah’, she murmur'd, ‘that the gods were kind, And bade the Harpies lay their hands on me, And bear me with the currents of the wind To the dim end of all things, and the blind Land where the Ocean turneth in his bed: Then should I leave mine evil days behind, And Sleep should fold his wings above my head’. VIII And once she heard a Trojan woman bless The fair-haired Menelaus, her good lord, As brave among brave men, not merciless, Not swift to slay the captives of his sword, Nor wont was he to win the gold abhorr'd Of them that sell their captives over sea. And Helen sighed, and bless'd her for that word, ‘Yet will he ne'er be merciful to me!’ IX In no wise found she comfort; to abide In Ilios was to dwell with shame and fear, And if unto the Argive host she hied, Then should she die by him that was most dear. And still the days dragg'd on with bitter cheer, Till even the great gods had little joy, So fast their children fell beneath the spear, Below the windy battlements of Troy. X Yet many a prince of south lands, or of east, For dark Cassandra's love came trooping in; And Priam made them merry at the feast, And all night long they dream'd of wars to win. And with the morning hurl'd into the din, And cried their lady's name for battle-cry, And won no more than this: for Paris' sin, By Diomede's or Aias' hand to die. XI But for one hour within the night of woes The hope of Troy burn'd steadfast as a star; When strife among the Argive lords arose, And dread Achilles held him from the war; Yea, and Apollo from his golden car And silver bow his shafts of evil sped, And all the plain was darken'd, near and far, With smoke above the pyres of heroes dead. XII And many a time through vapour of that smoke The shafts of Troy fell fast; and on the plain All night the Trojan watch fires burn'd and broke Like evil stars athwart a mist of rain. And through the arms and blood, and through the slain, Like wolves among the fragments of the fight, Crept spies to slay whoe'er forgat his pain One hour, and fell on slumber in the night. XIII And once, when wounded chiefs their tents did keep, And only Aias might his weapons wield, Came Hector with his host, and smiting deep, Brake bow and spear, brake axe and glaive and shield; Bulwark and battlement must rend and yield. And by the ships he smote the foe and cast Fire on the ships; and o'er the stricken field, The Trojans saw that flame arise at last! XIV But when Achilles saw the soaring flame, And knew the ships in peril, suddenly A change upon his wrathful spirit came, Nor will'd he that the Danaans should die: But call'd his Myrmidons, and with a cry They follow'd where, like foam on a sea-wave Patroclus' crest was dancing white and high, Above the tide that back the Trojans drave. XV But like a rock amid the shifting sands, And changing springs, and tumult of the deep, Sarpedon stood, till 'neath Patroclus' hands, Smitten he fell; then Death and gentle Sleep Bare him from forth the battle to the steep Where shines his castle o'er the Lycian dell; There hath he burial due, while all folk weep Around the kindly prince that loved them well. XVI Not unavenged he fell, nor all alone To Hades did his soul indignant fly, For soon was keen Patroclus overthrown By Hector, and the god of archery; And Hector stripp'd his shining panoply, Bright arms Achilles lent: ah! naked then, Forgetful wholly of his chivalry, Patroclus lay, nor heard the strife of men. XVII Then Hector from the war a little space Withdrew, and clad him in Achilles' gear, And braced the gleaming helmet o'er his face, And grasp'd the shield; but not the Pelian spear He won—the lance that makes the boldest fear; And home his comrades bare his arms of gold, Those Priam once had worn, his father dear, But in his father's arms he waxed not old! XVIII Then round Patroclus' body, like a tide That storms the swollen outlet of a stream When the winds blow, and the rains fall, and wide The river runs, and white the breakers gleam— Trojans and Argives battled till the beam Of Helios was sinking to the wave, And now they near'd the ships: yet few could deem That arms of Argos might the body save. XIX But even then the tidings sore were borne To great Achilles, of Patroclus dead, And all his goodly raiment hath he torn, And cast the dust upon his golden head, And many a tear and bitter did he shed. Ay; there by his own sword had he been slain, But swift his goddess-mother, Thetis, sped Forth with her lovely sea-nymphs from the main. XX For, as a mother when her young child calls Hearkens to that, and hath no other care: So Thetis, from her green and windless halls Rose, at the first word of Achilles' prayer, To comfort him, and promise gifts of fair New armour wrought by an immortal hand; Then like a silver cloud she scaled the air, Where bright the dwellings of Olympus stand. XXI But, as a beacon from a 'leaguer'd town Within a sea-girt isle, leaps suddenly, A cloud by day; but when the sun goes down, The tongues of fire flash out, and soar on high, To summon warlike men that dwell thereby And bid them bring a rescue over-seas— So now Athene sent a flame to fly From brow and temples of Æacides. XXII Then all unarm'd he sped, and through the throng, He pass'd to the dyke's edge, beyond the wall; Nor leap'd the ranks of fighting men among, But shouted clearer than the clarion's call When foes on a beleaguer'd city fall. Three times he cried, and terror fell on these That heard him; and the Trojans, one and all, Fled from that shouting of Æacides. XXIII Backward the Trojans reel'd in headlong flight, Chariots and men, and left their bravest slain; And the sun fell; but Troy through all the night Watch'd by her fires upon the Ilian plain, For Hector did the sacred walls disdain Of Ilios; nor knew that he should stand Ere night return'd, and burial crave in vain, Unarm'd, forsaken, at Achilles' hand. XXIV But all that night within his chamber high Hephæstus made his iron anvils ring; And, ere the dawn, had wrought a panoply, The goodliest ever worn by mortal king. This to the Argive camp did Thetis bring, And when her child had proved it, like the star That heralds day, he went forth summoning The host Achæan to delight of war. XXV And as a mountain torrent leaves its bed, And seaward sweeps the toils of men in spate; Or as a forest-fire, that overhead Burns in the boughs, a thing insatiate, So raged the fierce Achilles in his hate; And Xanthus, angry for his Trojans slain, Brake forth, while fire and wind made desolate What war and wave had spared upon the plain. XXVI Now through the fume and vapour of the smoke Between the wind's voice and the water's cry, The battle shouting of the Trojans broke, And reached the Ilian walls confusedly; But over soon the folk that watch'd might spy Thin broken bands that fled, avoiding death; Yet many a man beneath the spear must die, Ere by the sacred gateway they drew breath. XXVII And as when fire doth on a forest fall And hot winds bear it raging in its flight, And beechen boughs, and pines are ruin'd all, So raged Achilles' anger in that fight; And many an empty car, with none to smite The madden'd horses, o'er the bridge of war Was wildly whirled, and many a maid's delight That day to the red wolves was dearer far. XXVIII Some Muse that loved not Troy hath done thee wrong, Homer! who whisper'd thee that Hector fled Thrice round the sacred walls he kept so long; Nay, when he saw his people vanquishèd Alone he stood for Troy; alone he sped One moment, to the struggle of the spear, And, by the gods deserted, fell and bled, A warrior stainless of reproach and fear. XXIX Then all the people from the battlement Beheld what dreadful things Achilles wrought, For on the body his revenge he spent, The anger of the high gods heeding nought, To whom was Hector dearest, while he fought, Of all the Trojan men that were their joy. But now no more their favour might be bought By savour of his hecatombs in Troy. XXX So for twelve days rejoiced the Argive host, And now Patroclus hath to Hades won; But Hector naked lay, and still his ghost Must wail where waters of Cocytus run; Till Priam did what no man born hath done, Who dared to pass among the Argive bands, And clasp'd the knees of him that slew his son, And kiss'd his terrible man-slaying hands. XXXI At such a price was Hector's body sent To Ilios, where the women wail'd him shrill; And Helen's sorrow brake into lament As bursts a lake the barriers of a hill, For lost, lost, lost was that one friend who still Stood by her with kind speech and gentle heart, The sword of war, pure faith, and steadfast will, That strove to keep all evil things apart. XXXII And so men buried Hector. But they came, The Amazons, from frozen fields afar— A match for heroes in the dreadful game, The women darlings of the god of war, Whose coming was to Priam dearer far Than light to him that is a long while blind, When leech's hand hath taën away the bar That vex'd him, or the healing god is kind; XXXIII And Troy was glad, and with the morning light The Amazons went forth to slay and slay; And wondrously they drave the foe in flight, Until the sun had wander'd half his way; But when he stoop'd to twilight and the gray Hour when men loose the steer beneath the yoke, No more Achilles held him from the fray, But dreadful through the women's ranks he broke. XXXIV Then comes eclipse upon the crescent shield, And death on them that bear it, and they fall One here, one there, about the stricken field, As in that art, of love memorial, Which moulders on the holy Carian wall. Ay, still we see, still love, still pity there The warrior-maids, so brave, so god-like tall, In time's despite imperishably fair. XXXV But, as a dove that braves a falcon, stood Penthesilea, wrath outcasting fear, Or as a hind, that in the darkling wood Withstands a lion for her younglings dear; So stood the girl before Achilles' spear; In vain, for singing from his hand it sped, And crash'd through shield and breastplate till the sheer Cold bronze drank blood, and down the queen fell dead. XXXVI Then from her locks the helm Achilles tore And boasted o'er the slain; but lo, the face Of her thus lying in the dust and gore Seem'd lovelier than is the maiden grace Of Artemis, when weary from the chase, She sleepeth in a haunted dell unknown. And all the Argives marvell'd for a space, But most Achilles made a heavy moan: XXXVII And in his heart there came the weary thought Of all that was, and all that might have been; Of all the sorrow that his sword had wrought, Of death that now drew near him: of the green Vales of Larissa, where, with such a queen, With such a love as now his spear had slain, He had been happy, who must wind the skein Of grievous wars, and ne'er be glad again. XXXVIII Yea, now wax'd fate half weary of her game, And had no care but aye to kill and kill; And many young kings to the battle came, And of that joy they quickly had their fill, And last came Memnon: and the Trojans still Took heart, like wearied mariners that see (Long toss'd on unknown waves at the winds' will Through clouds the gleaming crest of Helikê. XXXIX For Memnon was the child of the bright dawn, A goddess wedded to a mortal king, Who dwells for ever on the shores withdrawn That border on the land of sun-rising; And he was nurtured nigh the sacred spring That is the hidden fountain of all seas, By them that in the gods' own garden sing, The lily-maidens call'd Hesperides. XL But him the child of Thetis in the fight Met on a windy winter day, when high The dust was whirled, and wrapp'd them like the night That falleth on the mountains stealthily When the floods come, and down their courses dry The torrents roar, and lightning flasheth far: So rang, so shone their harness terribly Beneath the blinding thunder-cloud of war. XLI Then the dawn shudder'd on her golden throne, And called unto the west wind, and he blew And brake the cloud asunder; and alone Achilles stood, but Memnon, smitten through, Lay beautiful amid the dreadful dew Of battle, and a deathless heart was fain Of tears, to gods impossible, that drew From mortal hearts a little of their pain. XLII But now, their leader slain, the Trojans fled, And fierce Achilles drove them in his hate, Avenging still his dear Patroclus dead, Nor knew the hour with his own doom was great, Nor trembled, standing in the Scaean gate, Where ancient prophecy foretold his fall; Then suddenly there sped the bolt of fate, And smote Achilles by the Ilian wall: XLIII From Paris' bow it sped, and even there, Even as he grasp'd the skirts of victory, Achilles fell, nor any man might dare From forth the Trojan gateway to draw nigh; But, as the woodmen watch a lion die, Pierced with the hunter's arrow, nor come near Till death hath veil'd his eyelids utterly, Even so the Trojans held aloof in fear. XLIV But there his fellows on his wondrous shield Laid the fair body of Achilles slain, And sadly bare him through the trampled field, And lo! the deathless maidens of the main Rose up, with Thetis, from the windy plain, And round the dead man beautiful they cried, Lamenting, and with melancholy strain The sweet-voiced Muses mournfully replied. XLV Yea, Muses and sea-maidens sang his dirge, And mightily the chant arose and shrill; And wondrous echoes answer'd from the surge Of the gray sea, and from the holy hill Of Ida; and the heavy clouds and chill Were gathering like mourners, sad and slow, And Zeus did thunder mightily, and fill The dells and glades of Ida deep with snow. XLVI Now Paris was not sated with the fame And rich reward Troy gave his archery; But o'er the wine he boasted that the game That very night he deem'd to win, or die; ‘For scarce their watch the tempest will defy’, He said, ‘and all undream'd of might we go, And fall upon the Argives where they lie, Unseen, unheard, amid the silent snow’. XLVII So, flush'd with wine, and clad in raiment white Above their mail, the young men follow'd him, Their guide a fading camp-fire in the night, And the sea's moaning in the distance dim; And still with eddying snow the air did swim, And darkly did they wend they knew not where, White in that cursed night: an army grim, 'Wilder'd with wine, and blind with whirling air. XLVIII There was an outcast in the Argive host, One Philoctetes; whom Odysseus' wile, (For, save he help'd, the Leaguer all was lost,) Drew from his lair within the Lemnian isle. But him the people, as a leper vile, Hated, and drave to a lone hut afar, For wounded sore was he, and many a while His cries would wake the host foredone with war. XLIX Now Philoctetes was an archer wight; But in his quiver had he little store Of arrows tipp'd with bronze, and feather'd bright; Nay, his were blue with mould, and fretted o'er With many a spell Melampus wrought of yore, Singing above his task a song of bane; And they were venom'd with the Centaur's gore, And tipp'd with bones of men a long while slain. L This wretch for very pain might seldom sleep, And that night slept not: in the moaning blast He deem'd the dead about his hut did creep, And silently he rose, and round him cast His raiment foul, and from the door he pass'd, And peer'd into the night, and soothly heard A whisper'd voice; then gripp'd his arrows fast And strung his bow, and cried a bitter word: LI ‘Art thou a gibbering ghost with war outworn, And thy faint life in Hades not begun? Art thou a man that holdst my grief in scorn, And yet dost live, and look upon the sun? If man—methinks thy pleasant days are done, And thou shalt writhe in torment worse than mine; If ghost—new pain in Hades hast thou won, And there with double woe shalt surely pine.’ LII He spake, and drew the string, and sent a shaft At venture through the midnight and the snow. A little while he listen'd, then he laugh'd Within himself, a dreadful laugh and low; For over well the answer did he know That midnight gave his message, the sharp cry And armour rattling on a fallen foe Who now was learning what it is to die. LIII Then Philoctetes crawl'd into his den And hugg'd himself against the bitter cold; While round their leader came the Trojan men And bound his hurt, and bare him o'er the wold, Back to the lights of Ilios; but the gold Of dawn was breaking on the mountains white, Or ere they won within the guarded fold, Long 'wilder'd in the tempest and the night. LIV And through the gate, and through the silent street, And houses where men dream'd of war no more, The bearers wander'd with their weary feet, And Paris to his high-roof'd house they bore. But vainly leeches on his wound did pore, And vain was Argive Helen's magic song; Ah, vain her healing hands, and all her lore, To help the life that wrought her endless wrong. LV Slow pass'd the fever'd hours, until the gray Cold light was paling, and a sullen glow Of livid yellow crown'd the dying day, And brooded on the wastes of mournful snow. Then Paris whisper'd faintly, ‘I must go And face that wild wood-maiden of the hill; For none but she can win from overthrow Troy's life, and mine that guards it, if she will.’ LVI So through the dumb white meadows, deep with snow, They bore him on a pallet shrouded white; And sore they dreaded lest an ambush'd foe Should hear him moan, or mark the moving light That waved before their footsteps in the night; And much they joy'd when Ida's knees were won, And 'neath the pines upon an upland height, They watch'd the star that heraldeth the sun. LVII For under woven branches of the pine, The soft dry needles like a carpet spread, And high above the arching boughs did shine In frosty fret of silver, that the red New dawn fired into gold-work overhead: Within that vale where Paris oft had been With fair (CE)none, ere the hills he fled To be the sinful lover of a queen. LVIII Not here they found (CE)none: ‘Nay, not here,’ Said Paris, faint and low, ‘shall she be found; Nay, bear me up the mountain, where the drear Winds walk for ever on a haunted ground. Methinks I hear her sighing in their sound; Or some god calls me there, a dying man. Perchance my latest journeying is bound Back where the sorrow of my life began.’ LVIX They reach'd the gateway of that highest glen And halted, wond'ring what the end should be; But Paris whisper'd Helen, while his men Fell back: ‘Here judged I gods, here shalt thou see What judgment mine old love will pass on me. But hide thee here; thou soon the end shalt know, Whether the gods at length will set thee free From that old net they wove so long ago.’ LX Ah, there with wide snows round her like a pall, (CE)none crouch'd in sable robes; as still As winter brooding o'er the summer's fall, Or Niobe upon her haunted hill, A woman changed to stone by grief, where chill The rain-drops fall like tears, and the wind sighs: And Paris deem'd he saw a deadly will Unmoved in wild (CE)none's frozen eyes. LXI ‘Nay, prayer to her were vain as prayer to fate’, He murmur'd, almost glad that it was so, Like some sick man that need no longer wait, But his pain lulls as death draws near his woe. And Paris beckon'd to his men, and slow They bore him dying from that fatal place, And did not turn again, and did not know The soft repentance on (CE)none's face. LXII But Paris spake to Helen: ‘Long ago, Dear, we were glad, who never more shall be Together, where the west winds fainter blow Round that Elysian island of the sea, Where Zeus from evil days shall set thee free. Nay, kiss me once, it is a weary while, Ten weary years since thou hast smiled on me, But, Helen, say good-bye, with thine old smile!’ LXIII And as the dying sunset through the rain Will flush with rosy glow a mountain height, Even so, at his last smile, a blush again Pass'd over Helen's face, so changed and white; And through her tears she smiled, his last delight, The last of pleasant life he knew, for gray The veil of darkness gather'd, and the night Closed o'er his head, and Paris pass'd away. LXIV Then for one hour in Helen's heart re-born, Awoke the fatal love that was of old, Ere she knew all; and the cold cheeks outworn, She kiss'd; she kiss'd the hair of wasted gold, The hands that ne'er her body should enfold; Then slow she follow'd where the bearers led, Follow'd dead Paris through the frozen wold Back to the town where all men wish'd her dead. LXV Perchance it was a sin, I know not, this! Howe'er it be, she had a woman's heart, And not without a tear, without a kiss, Without some strange new birth of the old smart, From her old love of the brief days could part For ever; though the dead meet, ne'er shall they Meet, and be glad by Aphrodite's art, Whose souls have wander'd each its several way. LXVI And now was come the day when on a pyre Men laid fair Paris, in a broider'd pall, And fragrant spices cast into the fire, And round the flame slew many an Argive thrall. When, like a ghost, there came among them all, A woman, once beheld by them of yore, When first through storm and driving rain the tall Black ships of Argos dash'd upon the shore. LXVII Not now in wrath (CE)none came; but fair Like a young bride when nigh her bliss she knows; And in the soft night of her fallen hair Shone flowers like stars, more white than Ida's snows; And scarce men dared to look on her, of those The pyre that guarded; suddenly she came, And sprang upon the pyre, and shrill arose Her song of death, like incense through the flame. LXVIII And still the song, and still the flame went up, But when the flame wax'd fierce, the singing died; And soon with red wine from a golden cup Priests drench'd the pyre; but no man might divide The ashes of the bridegroom from the bride. Nay, they were wedded, and at rest again, As in those old days on the mountain-side, Before the promise of their youth was vain. BOOK VI The sack of Troy, and how Menelaus would have let stone Helen, but Aphrodite saved her, and made them at one again, and how they came home to Lacedæmon, and of their translation to Elysium. THE SACK OF TROY. THE RETURN OF HELEN I There came a day, when Trojan spies beheld How, o'er the Argive leaguer, all the air Was pure of smoke, no battle-din there swell'd, Nor any clarion-call was sounding there! Yea, of the serried ships the strand was bare, And sea and shore were still, as long ago When Ilios knew not Helen, and the fair Sweet face that makes immortal all her woe. II So for a space the watchers on the wall Were silent, wond'ring what these things might mean. But, at the last, sent messengers to call Priam, and all the elders, and the lean Remnant of goodly chiefs, that once had been The shield and stay of Ilios, and her joy, Nor yet despair'd, but trusted gods unseen, And cast their spears, and shed their blood for Troy. III They came; the more part gray, grown early old, In war and plague; but with them was the young Corœbus, that but late had left the fold And flocks of sheep Mæonian hills among, And valiantly his lot with Priam flung, For love of a lost cause and a fair face— The eyes the god of Pytho once had sung, That now look'd darkly to the slaughter-place. IV Now while the elders kept their long debate, Corœbus stole unheeded to his band, And led a handful by a postern gate Across the plain, across the barren land Where once the happy vines were wont to stand; And 'mid the clusters once did maidens sing— But now the plain was waste on every hand, Though here and there a flower would breathe of spring. V So swift across the trampled battle-field Unchallenged still, but wary, did they pass, By many a broken spear or shatter'd shield That in fate's hour appointed faithless was: Only the heron cried from the morass By Xanthus' side, and ravens, and the gray Wolves left their feasting in the tangled grass, Grudging; and loiter'd, nor fled far away. VI There lurk'd no spears in the high river-banks, No ambush by the cairns of men outworn; But empty stood the huts, in dismal ranks, Where men through all these many years had borne Fierce summer, and the biting winter's scorn; And here a sword was left, and there a bow; But ruinous seem'd all things and forlorn, As in some camp forsaken long ago. VII Gorged wolves crept round the altars, and did eat The flesh of victims that the priests had slain; And wild dogs fought above the sacred meat Late offer'd to the deathless gods in vain, By men that, for reward of all their pain, Must haul the ropes, and weary at the oar, Or, drowning, clutch at foam amid the main, Nor win their haven on the Argive shore. VIII Not long the young men marvell'd at the sight, But grasping, one a sword, and one the spear, Aias, or Tydeus' son, had borne in fight, They sped, and fill'd the town with merry cheer; For folk were quick the happy news to hear, And pour'd through all the gates into the plain, Rejoicing as they wander'd far and near, O'er the long Argive toils endured in vain. IX Ah, sweet it was, without the city walls, To hear the doves coo, and the finches sing; Ah, sweet, to twine their true-loves coronals Of woven wind-flowers, and each fragrant thing That blossoms in the footsteps of the spring; And sweet to lie, forgetful of their grief, Where violets hide by waters wandering, And the wild fig-tree putteth forth his leaf! X Now while they wander'd as they would, they found A wondrous thing: a marvel of man's skill, That stood within a vale of hollow ground, And bulk'd scarce smaller than the bitter hill— The common barrow that the dead men fill Who died in the long leaguer—not of earth, Was this new portent, but of tree, and still The Trojans stood, and marvell'd 'mid their mirth. XI Ay, much they wonder'd what this thing might be; Shaped like a horse it was; and many a stain There show'd upon the mighty beams of tree. For some with fire were blacken'd, some with rain Were dank and dark amid white planks of plane, New cut among the trees that now were few On wasted Ida; but men gazed in vain, Nor truth thereof for all their searching knew. XII At length they deem'd it was a sacred thing, Vow'd to Poseidon, monarch of the deep; And that herewith the Argives pray'd the king Of wind and wave to lull the seas to sleep; So this, they cried, within the sacred keep Of Troy must rest, memorial of the war; And sturdily they haled it up the steep, And dragg'd the monster to their walls afar. XIII All day they wrought: and children crown'd with flowers Laid light hands on the ropes; old men would ply Their feeble force; so through the merry hours They toil'd, midst laughter and sweet minstrelsy, And late they drew the great horse to the high Crest of the hill, and wide the tall gates swang; But thrice, for all their force, it stood thereby Unmoved, and thrice like smitten armour rang. XIV Natheless they wrought their will; then altar fires The Trojans built, and did the gods implore To grant fulfilment of all glad desires. But from the cups the wine they might not pour, The flesh upon the spits did writhe and roar, The smoke grew red as blood, and many a limb Of victims leap'd upon the temple floor, Trembling; and groans amid the chapels dim XV Rang low, and from the fair gods' images And from their eyes, dropp'd sweat and many a tear; The walls with blood were dripping, and on these That sacrificed, came horror and great fear; The holy laurels to Apollo dear Beside his temple faded suddenly, And wild wolves from the mountains drew anear, And ravens through the temples seem'd to fly. XVI Yet still the men of Troy were glad at heart, And o'er strange meat they revell'd, like folk fey, Though each would shudder if he glanced apart, For round their knees the mists were gather'd gray, Like shrouds on men that hell-ward take their way; But merrily withal they feasted thus, And laugh'd with crooked lips, and oft would say Some evil-sounding word and ominous. XVII And Hecuba among her children spake, ‘Let each man choose the meat he liketh best, For bread no more together shall we break. Nay, soon from all my labour must I rest. But eat ye well, and drink the red wine, lest Ye blame my house-wifery among men dead.’ And all they took her saying for a jest, And sweetly did they laugh at that she said. XVIII Then, like a raven on the wind of night, The wild Cassandra flitted far and near, Still crying, ‘Gather—gather for the fight, And brace the helmet on, and grasp the spear, For lo, the legions of the night are here!’ So shriek'd the dreadful prophetess divine. But all men mock'd, and were of merry cheer; Safe as the gods they deem'd them, o'er their wine. XIX For now with minstrelsy the air was sweet, The soft spring air, and thick with incense smoke; And bands of happy dancers down the street Flew from the flower-crown'd doors, and wheel'd, and broke; And loving words the youths and maidens spoke, For Aphrodite did their hearts beguile, As when beneath gray cavern or green oak The shepherd men and maidens meet and smile. XX How many a strength hath fallen since thy fall, Ah, Troy! yet still must men remember thee, Though none doth weep o'er Corinth's funeral, Nor Carthage left forsaken by the sea, Orchomenos, nor Thebes, nor Nineveh! All these have been and are not, but the fate Of Troy, that never was, how wondrously It moves our hearts in these swift years and late! XXI A castle built in cloud-land; or at most A crumbling clay-fort on a windy hill, Where needy men might flee a robber host, This, this was Troy! and yet she holds us still; And I that rhyme, right sore against my will And lingering long before the words of woe, This ending of my task must I fulfil And tell the tale of Ilios' overthrow. XXII No guard men set, for truly to them all Did love and slumber seem exceeding good; There was no watch by open gate nor wall, No sentinel by Pallas' image stood; But silence grew, as in an autumn wood When tempests die, and the vex'd boughs have ease, And wind and sunlight fade, and soft the mood Of sacred twilight falls upon the trees. XXIII Then the stars cross'd the zenith, and there came On Troy that hour when slumber is most deep, But any man that watch'd had seen a flame Spring from the tall crest of the Trojan keep; While from the belly of the horse did leap Men arm'd, and to the gates went stealthily, While up the rocky way to Ilios creep The Argives, new return'd across the sea. XXIV Now when the silence broke, and in that hour When first the dawn of war was blazing red, There came a light in Helen's fragrant bower, As on that evil night before she fled From Lacedæmon and her marriage bed; And Helen in great fear lay still and cold, For Aphrodite stood above her head, And spake in that sweet voice she knew of old: XXV ‘Beloved one that dost not love me, wake! Helen, the night is over, the dawn is near; And safely shalt thou fare with me, and take Thy way through fire and blood, and have no fear: A little hour—and ended is the drear Tale of thy sorrow and thy wandering. Nay, long hast thou to live in happy cheer, By fair Eurotas, with thy lord, the king.’ XXVI Then Helen rose, and in a cloud of gold, Unseen amid the vapour of the fire, Did Aphrodite veil her, fold on fold; And through the darkness, thronged with faces dire, And o'er men's bodies fallen in a mire Of new spilt blood and wine, the twain did go Where lust and hate were mingled in desire, And dreams and death were blended in one woe. XXVII Fire and the foe were masters now: the sky Flared like the dawn of that last day of all, When men for pity to the sea shall cry, And vainly on the mountain tops shall call To fall and end the horror in their fall; And through the vapour dreadful things saw they, The maidens leaping from the city wall, The sleeping children murder'd where they lay. XXVIII Yea, cries like those that make the hills of hell Ring and re-echo, sounded through the night, The screams of burning horses, and the yell Of young men leaping naked into fight, And shrill the women shriek'd, as in their flight Shriek the wild cranes, when overhead they spy Between the dusky cloud-land and the bright Blue air, an eagle stooping from the sky. XXIX And now the red glare of the burning shone On deeds so dire the pure gods might not bear, Save Ares only, long to look thereon, But with a cloud they darken'd all the air. And, even then, within the temple fair Of chaste Athene, did Cassandra cower, And cried aloud an unavailing prayer; For Aias was the master in that hour. XXX Man's lust won what a god's love might not win; And heroes trembled, and the temple floor Shook, when one cry went up into the din, And shamed the night to silence; then the roar Of war and fire wax'd great as heretofore, Till each roof fell, and every palace gate Was shatter'd, and the king's blood shed; nor more Remain'd to do, for Troy was desolate. XXXI Then dawn drew near, and changed to clouds of rose The dreadful smoke that clung to Ida's head; But Ilios was ashes, and the foes Had left the embers and the plunder'd dead; And down the steep they drove the prey, and sped Back to the swift ships, with a captive train— While Menelaus, slow, with drooping head, Follow'd, like one lamenting, through the plain. XXXII Where death might seem the surest, by the gate Of Priam, where the spears raged, and the tall Towers on the foe were falling, sought he fate To look on Helen once, and then to fall; Nor see with living eyes the end of all, What time the host their vengeance should fulfil, And cast her from the cliff below the wall, Or burn her body on the windy hill. XXXIII But Helen found he never, where the flame Sprang to the roofs, and Helen ne'er he found Where flock'd the wretched women in their shame The helpess altars of the gods around. Nor lurk'd she in deep chambers underground, Where the priests trembled o'er their hidden gold, Nor where the armèd feet of foes resound In shrines to silence consecrate of old. XXXIV So wounded to his hut and wearily Came Menelaus; and he bow'd his head Beneath the lintel neither fair nor high; And, lo! Queen Helen lay upon his bed, Flush'd like a child in sleep, and rosy-red, And at his footstep did she wake and smile, And spake: ‘My lord, how hath thy hunting sped, Methinks that I have slept a weary while!’ XXXV For Aphrodite made the past unknown To Helen, as of old, when in the dew Of that fair dawn the net was round her thrown: Nay, now no memory of Troy brake through The mist that veil'd from her sweet eyes and blue The dreadful days and deeds all over-past, And gladly did she greet her lord anew, And gladly would her arms have round him cast. XXXVI Then leap'd she up in terror, for he stood Before her, like a lion of the wild, His rusted armour all bestain'd with blood, His mighty hands with blood of men defiled, And strange was all she saw: the spears, the piled Raw skins of slaughter'd beasts with many a stain; And low he spake, and bitterly he smiled, ‘The hunt is ended, and the spoil is ta'en.’ XXXVII No more he spake; for certainly he deem'd That Aphrodite brought her to that place, And that of her loved archer Helen dream'd— Of Paris; at that thought the mood of grace Died in him, and he hated her fair face, And bound her hard, not slacking for her tears; Then silently departed for a space, To seek the ruthless counsel of his peers. XXXVIII Now all the kings were feasting in much joy, Seated or couch'd upon the carpets fair That late had strown the palace floors of Troy; And lovely Trojan ladies served them there, And meat from off the spits young princes bare; But Menelaus burst among them all, Strange 'mid their revelry, and did not spare, But bade the kings a sudden council call. XXXIX To mar their feast the kings had little will, Yet did they as he bade, in grudging wise; And heralds call'd the host unto the hill Heap'd of sharp stones, where ancient Ilus lies. And forth the people flock'd, as throng'd as flies That buzz about the milking-pails in spring, When life awakens under April skies, And birds from dawning into twilight sing. XL Then Helen through the camp was driven and thrust, Till even the Trojan women cried in glee, ‘Ah, where is she in whom was set thy trust, The queen of love and laughter, where is she? Behold the last gift that she giveth thee, Thou of the many loves! to die alone, And round thy flesh for robes of price to be The cold close-clinging raiment of sharp stone.’ XLI Ah, slowly through that trodden field and bare They pass'd, where scarce the daffodil might spring; For war had wasted all, but in the air High overhead the mounting lark did sing; Then all the army gather'd in a ring Round Helen, round their torment, trapp'd at last, And many took up mighty stones to fling From shards and flints on Ilus' barrow cast. XLII Then Menelaus to the people spoke, And swift his wing'd words came as whirling snow, ‘Oh ye that overlong have borne the yoke, Behold the very fountain of your woe! For her ye left your dear homes long ago, On Argive valley or Bœotian plain; But now the black ships rot from stern to prow, Who knows if ye shall see your own again? XLIII ‘Ay, and if home ye win, ye yet may find, Ye that the winds waft, and the waters bear To Argos! ye are quite gone out of mind; Your fathers, dear and old, dishonour'd there; Your children deem you dead, and will not share Their lands with you; on mainland or on isle, Strange men are wooing now the women fair, And love doth lightly woman's heart beguile. XLIV ‘These sorrows hath this woman wrought alone: So fall upon her straightway that she die, And clothe her beauty in a cloak of stone!’ He spake, and truly deem'd to hear her cry And see the sharp flints straight and deadly fly; But each man stood and mused on Helen's face, And her undream'd-of beauty, brought so nigh On that bleak plain, within that ruin'd place. XLV And as in far off days that were to be, The sense of their own sin did men constrain, That they must leave the sinful woman free Who, by their law, had verily been slain, So Helen's beauty made their anger vain, And one by one his gather'd flints let fall; And like men shamed they stole across the plain, Back to the swift ships and their festival. XLVI But Menelaus look'd on her and said, ‘Hath no man then condemn'd thee—is there none To shed thy blood for all that thou hast shed, To wreak on thee the wrongs that thou hast done? Nay, as mine own soul liveth, there is one That will not set thy barren beauty free, But slay thee to Poseidon and the sun Before a ship Achaian takes the sea!’ XLVII Therewith he drew his sharp sword from his thigh As one intent to slay her: but behold, A sudden marvel shone across the sky! A flood of rosy fire, a cloud of gold, And Aphrodite came from forth the fold Of wondrous mist, and sudden at her feet Lotus and crocus on the trampled wold Brake, and the slender hyacinth was sweet. XLVIII Then fell the point that never bloodless fell When spear bit harness in the battle din; For Aphrodite spake, and like a spell Wrought her sweet voice persuasive, till within His heart there lived no memory of sin, No thirst for vengeance more, but all grew plain, And wrath was molten in desire to win The golden heart of Helen once again. XLIX Then Aphrodite vanish'd as the day Passes, and leaves the darkling earth behind; And overhead the April sky was gray, But Helen's arms about her lord were twined, And his round her as clingingly and kind, As when sweet vines and ivy in the spring Join their glad leaves, nor tempests may unbind The woven boughs, so lovingly they cling. L Noon long was over-past, but sacred night Beheld them not upon the Ilian shore; Nay, for about the waning of the light Their swift ships wander'd on the waters hoar, Nor stay'd they the Olympians to adore, So eagerly they left that cursed land, But many a toil, and tempests great and sore, Befell them ere they won the Argive strand. LI To Cyprus and Phœnicia wandering They came, and many a ship, and many a man They lost, and perish'd many a precious thing While bare before the stormy north they ran; And further far than when their quest began From Argos did they seem—a weary while— Becalm'd in sultry seas Egyptian, A long day's voyage from the mouths of Nile. LII But there the gods had pity on them, and there The ancient Proteus taught them how to flee From that so distant deep—the fowls of air Scarce in one year can measure out that sea; Yet first within Ægyptus must they be, And hecatombs must offer—quickly then The gods abated of their jealousy, Wherewith they scourge the negligence of men. LIII And strong and fair the south wind blew, and flect Their voyaging, so merrily they fled To win that haven where the waters sweet Of clear Eurotas with the brine are wed; And swift their chariots and their horses sped To pleasant Lacedæmon, lying low Gray in the shade of sunset; but the head Of tall Taygetus like fire did glow. LIV And what but this is sweet: at last to win The fields of home, that change not while we change; To hear the birds their ancient song begin; To wander by the well-loved streams that range Where not one pool, one moss-clad stone is strange; Nor seem we older than long years ago, Though now beneath the gray roof of the grange The children dwell of them we used to know? LV Came there no trouble in the later days To mar the life of Helen, when the old Crowns and dominions perish'd, and the blaze Lit by returning Heraclidæ roll'd Through every vale and every happy fold Of all the Argive land? Nay, peacefully Did Menelaus and the Queen behold The counted years of mortal life go by. LVI ‘Death ends all tales’, but this he endeth not; They grew not gray within the valley fair Of hollow Lacedæmon, but were brought To Rhadamanthus of the golden hair, Beyond the wide world's end; ah, never there Comes storm nor snow; all grief is left behind, And men immortal, in enchanted air, Breathe the cool current of the western wind. LVII But Helen was a saint in heathendom, A kinder Aphrodite; without fear Maidens and lovers to her shrine would come In fair Therapnæ, by the waters clear Of swift Eurotas; gently did she hear All prayers of love, and not unheeded came The broken supplication, and the tear Of man or maiden overweigh'd with shame. O'er Helen's shrine the grass is growing green, In desolate Therapnæ; none the less Her sweet face now unworshipp'd and unseen Abides the symbol of all loveliness, Of Beauty ever stainless in the stress Of warring lusts and fears; and still divine, Still ready with immortal peace to bless Them that with pure hearts worship at her shrine. XVI SONGS FROM ‘THE WORLD'S DESIRE’ AND ‘CLEOPATRA’ From ‘THE WORLD'S DESIRE’ Invitation Come with us, ye whose hearts are set On this, the present to forget; Come read the things whereof ye know They were not, and could not be so! The murmur of the fallen creeds, Like winds among wind-shaken reeds Along the banks of holy Nile, Shall echo in your ears the while; The fables of the north and south Shall mingle in a modern mouth; The fancies of the west and east Shall flock and flit about the feast Like doves that cooled, with waving wing, The banquets of the Cyprian king. Old shapes of song that do not die Shall haunt the halls of memory, And though the Bow shall prelude clear Shrill as the song of Gunnar's spear, There answer sobs from lute and lyre That murmured of The World's Desire. There lives no man but he hath seen The World's Desire, the fairy queen. None but hath seen her to his cost, Not one but loves what he has lost. None is there but hath heard her sing Divinely through his wandering; Not one but he hath followed far The portent of the Bleeding Star; Not one but he hath chanced to wake, Dreamed of the Star and found the Snake. Yet, through his dreams—a wandering fire, Still, still she flits, The World's Desire! The Song of the Bow Keen and low Doth the arrow sing The Song of the Bow, The sound of the string. The shafts cry shrill: Let us forth again, Let us feed our fill On the flesh of men. Greedy and fleet Do we fly from far, Like the birds that meet For the feast of war, Till the air of fight With our wings be stirred, As it whirrs from the flight Of the ravening bird. Like the flakes that drift On the snow-wind's breath, Many and swift, And winged for death— Greedy and fleet, Do we speed from far, Like the birds that meet On the bridge of war. Fleet as ghosts that wail, When the dart strikes true, Do the swift shafts hail, Till they drink warm dew. Keen and low Do the gray shafts sing The Song of the Bow, The sound of the string. Lo! the hour is nigh And the time to smite, When the foe shall fly From the arrow's flight! Let the bronze bite deep! Let the war-birds fly Upon them that sleep And are ripe to die! Shrill and low Do the gray shafts sing The Song of the Bow, The sound of the string. ‘Though the light of the sun be bidden’ Though the light of the sun be hidden, Though his race be run; Though we sail in a sea forbidden To the golden sun; Though we wander alone, unknowing— Oh, heart of mine— The path of the strange sea-going, On the blood-red brine; Yet endure! We shall not be shaken By things worse than these; We have 'scaped, when our friends were taken, On the unsailed seas; Worse deaths have we faced and fled from, In the Cyclops' den, When the floor of his cave ran red from The blood of men; Worse griefs we have known undaunted, Worse fates have fled; When the Isle that our long love haunted Lay waste and dead! ‘The Lord our God’ The Lord our God He doth sign and wonder, Tokens He shows in the land of Khem, He hath shattered the pride of the kings asunder And casteth His shoe o'er the gods of them! He hath brought forth frogs in their holy places, He hath sprinkled the dust upon crown and hem, He hath hated their kings and hath darkened their faces; Wonders He works in the land of Khem. A lamp for our feet A Lamp for our feet the Lord hath litten, Signs hath He shown in the land of Khem. The kings of the nations our Lord hath smitten, His shoe hath He cast o'er the gods of them. He hath made Him a mock of the heifer of Isis, He hath broken the chariot reins of Ra, On Yakûb He cries, and His folk arises, And the knees of the nations are loosed in awe. He gives us their goods for a spoil to gather, Jewels of silver, and vessels of gold; For Yahveh of old is our Friend and Father, And cherisheth Yakûb He chose of old. The gods of the peoples our Lord hath chidden, Their courts hath He filled with His creeping things; The light of the face of the sun He hath hidden, And broken the scourge in the hands of kings. He hath chastened His people with stripes and scourges, Our backs hath He burdened with grievous weights, But His children shall rise as a sea that surges, And flood the fields of the men He hates. The kings of the nations our Lord hath smitten, His shoe hath He cast o'er the Gods of them, But a lamp for our feet the Lord hath litten, Wonders hath wrought in the land of Khem. Lost Love Who wins his love shall lose her, Who loses her shall gain, For still the spirit woos her, A soul without a stain; And memory still pursues her With longings not in vain! He loses her who gains her, Who watches day by day The dust of time that stains her, The griefs that leave her gray— The flesh that yet enchains her Whose grace hath passed away! Oh, happier he who gains not The love some seem to gain; The joy that custom stains not Shall still with him remain; The loveliness that wanes not, The love that ne'er can wane. In dreams she grows not older The lands of dream among; Though all the world wax colder, Though all the songs be sung, In dreams doth he behold her Still fair and kind and young. ‘Endure my Heart’ ‘Endure, my heart: not long shalt thou endure The shame, the smart; The good and ill are done; the end is sure; Endure, my heart! There stand two vessels by the golden throne Of Zeus on high; From these he scatters mirth and scatters moan, To men that die. And thou of many joys hast had thy share, Thy perfect part; Battle and love, and evil things and fair; Endure, my heart! Fight one last greatest battle under shield, Wage that war well: Then seek thy fellows in the shadowy field Of asphodel; There is the knightly Hector; there the men Who fought for Troy; Shall we not fight our battles o'er again? Were that not joy? Though no sun shines beyond the dusky west, Thy perfect part There shalt thou have of the unbroken rest; Endure, my heart!’ ‘O Joy of love's renewing’ Ojoy of love's renewing, Could love be born again; Relenting for thy rueing, And pitying my pain: O joy of love's awaking, Could love arise from sleep, Forgiving our forsaking The fields we would not reap! Fleet, fleet we fly, pursuing The love that fled amain, But will he list our wooing, Or call we but in vain? Ah! vain is all our wooing, And all our prayers are vain, Love listeth not our suing, Love will not wake again. ‘Will ye bring Flame’ ‘Will ye bring flame to burn my shrine Who am myself a flame? Bring death to tame this charm of mine That death can never tame? Will ye bring fire to harm my head Who am myself a fire? Bring vengeance for your lovers dead Upon the World's Desire? Nay, women while the earth endures, Your loves are not your own. They love you not, these loves of yours, Helen they love alone! My face they seek in every face, Mine eyes in yours they see, They do but kneel to you a space, And rise and follow me!’ Palinode Thou that of old didst blind Stesichorus, If e'er, sweet Helen, such a thing befell; We pray thee of thy grace, be good to us, Though little in our tale accordeth well With that thine ancient minstrel had to tell, Who saw, with sightless eyes grown luminous, These Ilian sorrows, and who heard the swell Of ocean round the world ring thunderous, And thy voice break when knightly Hector fell! And thou who all these many years hast borne To see the great webs of thy weaving torn By puny hands of dull, o'er-learned men, Homer, forgive us that thy hero's star Once more above sea waves and waves of war, Must rise, must triumph, and must set again! FROM ‘CLEOPATRA’ Lament for Osiris ‘Sing we Osiris dead, Lament the fallen head: The light has left the world, the world is gray. Athwart the starry skies The web of darkness flies, And Isis weeps Osiris passed away. Your tears, ye stars, ye fires, ye rivers, shed, Weep, children of the Nile, weep for your lord is dead!’ ‘Softly we tread, our measured footsteps falling Within the sanctuary sevenfold; Soft on the dead that liveth are we calling: “Return, Osiris, from thy Kingdom cold! Return to them that worship thee of old.”’ ‘Within the court divine The sevenfold sacred shrine We pass, while echoes of the temple walls Repeat the long lament The sound of sorrow sent Far up within the imperishable halls, Where, each in other's arms, the sisters weep, Isis and Nephthys, o'er his unawaking sleep.’ ‘Softly we tread, our measured footsteps falling Within the sanctuary sevenfold; Soft on the dead that liveth are we calling: “Return, Osiris, from thy kingdom cold! Return to them that worship thee of old.”’ ‘O dweller in the west, Lover and lordliest, Thy love, thy sister Isis, calls thee home! Come from thy chamber dun Thou master of the sun, Thy shadowy chamber far below the foam! With weary wings and spent Through all the firmament, Through all the horror-haunted ways of hell, I seek thee near and far, From star to wandering star, Free with the dead that in Amenti dwell. I search the height, the deep, the lands, the skies, Rise from the dead and live, our lord Osiris, rise!’ ‘Softly we tread, our measured footsteps falling Within the sanctuary sevenfold; Soft on the dead that liveth are we calling: “Return, Osiris, from thy kingdom cold! Return to them that worship thee of old.”’ The Awaking of Osiris ‘He wakes—from forth the prison We sing Osiris risen, We sing the child that Nout conceived and bare. Thine own love, Isis, waits The Warden of the gates, She breathes the breath of life on breast and hair. And in her breast and breath Behold! he wakeneth, Behold! at length he riseth out of rest; Touched with her holy hands, The lord of all the lands, He stirs, he rises from her breath, her breast! But thou, fell Typhon, fly, The judgment day drawn nigh, Fleet on thy track as flame speeds Horus from the sky.’ ‘Softly we tread, our measured footsteps falling Within the sanctuary sevenfold; Soft on the dead that liveth are we calling: “Return, Osiris, from thy kingdom cold! Return to them that worship thee of old.” ‘Sing we the trinity, Sing we the holy three, Sing we, and praise we and worship the throne; Throne that our lord hath set— There peace and truth are met There in the Halls of the Holy alone! There in the shadowings Faint of the folded wings, ‘There shall we dwell and rejoice in our rest; We that thy servants are! Horus drive ill afar! Far in the folds of the dark of the west!’ ‘Softly we tread, our measured footsteps falling Within the sanctuary sevenfold; Soft on the dead that liveth are we calling: “Return, Osiris, from thy kingdom cold! Return to them that worship thee of old.”’ ‘Osiris our hope! Osiris! Osiris!’ ‘Night on the Sea’ ‘Night on the sea, and night upon the sky, And music in our hearts, we floated there, Lulled by the low sea voices, thou and I, And the wind's kisses in my cloudy hair: And thou didst gaze on me and call me fair Enfolded by the starry robe of night;— And then thy singing thrilled upon the air, Voice of the heart's desire and love's delight.’ ‘Adrift, with starlit skies above, With starlit seas below, We move with all the suns that move, With all the seas that flow; For bond or free, earth, sky, and sea, Wheel with one circling will; And thy heart drifteth on to me, And only time stands still. ‘Between two shores of death we drift, Behind are things forgot: Before the tide is driving swift To lands beholden not. Above, the sky is far and cold; Below, the moaning sea Sweeps o'er the loves that were of old, But, oh, love! kiss thou me. ‘Ah, lonely are the ocean ways, And dangerous the deep; And frail the fairy barque that strays Above the seas asleep! Ah, toil no more at sail nor oar, We drift, or bond or free; On yon far shore the breakers roar, But, oh, love! kiss thou me. ‘Ah, lonely are the ocean ways, And dangerous the deep; And frail the fairy barque that strays Above the seas asleep! Ah, toil no more at sail nor oar, We drift, or bond or free; On yon far shore the breakers roar, But, oh, love! kiss thou me.’ ‘And ever as thou sangest I drew near, Then sudden silence heard our hearts that beat; For now there was an end of doubt and fear, Now passion filled my soul and led my feet; Then silent didst thou rise thy love to meet, Who, sinking on thy breast, knew naught but thee, And in the happy night I kissed thee, sweet; Ah, sweet! between the starlight and the sea.’ EPILOGUE The Poet's Apology No, the Muse has gone away, Does not haunt me much to-day. Everything she had to say Has been said! 'Twas not much at any time She could hitch into a rhyme, Never was the Muse sublime Who has fled! Any one who takes her in May observe she's rather thin; Little more than bone and skin Is the Muse; Scanty sacrifice she won When her very best she'd done, And at her they poked their fun, In Reviews. ‘Rhymes’, in truth, ‘are stubborn things’, And to rhyme she clung, and clings, But whatever song she sings Scarcely sells. If her tone be grave, they say ‘Give us something rather gay’. If she's skittish, then they pray ‘Something else’! Much she loved, for wading shod, To go forth with line and rod; Loved the heather, and the sod, Loved to rest On the crystal river's brim Where she saw the fishes swim, And she heard the thrushes' hymn, By the Test! She, whatever way she went, Friendly was and innocent, Little need the bard repent Of her lay; Of the babble and the rhyme, And the imitative chime That amused him on a time— Now he's gray.
