Of thir parablys as now I say no mor.

Schir Ranald Crawfurd, rycht schirreff of Ayr, So in hys tyme he had a dochtir fayr And ?onge schir Ranald, schirreff of that toune. His systir fair, off gud fame and ranoune, Malcom Wallas hir gat in mariage, That Elrisle than had in heretage, Auchinbothe and othir syndry place. The secund O he was of gud Wallace, The quhilk Wallas full worthely at wrocht Quhen Waltyr her of Waillis fra Warayn socht. Quha likis till haif mar knowledge in that part Go reid the rycht lyne of the fyrst Stewart. Bot Malcom gat upon this lady brycht Schir Malcom Wallas, a full gentill knycht, And Wil?ame als, as cornyklis beris on hand, Quhilk efftir was the reskew of Scotland. Quhen it was lost with tresoune and falsnas, Our-set be fais, he fred it weyle throu grace. Quhen Alexander our worthi king had lorn Be awentur his liff besid Kyngorn, Thre ?er in pes the Realm stude desolate, Quharfor thair rais a full grewous debate. Our prynce Dawy, the Erle of Huntyntoun, Thre dochtrys had that war of gret ranoun, Off quhilk thre com Bruce, Bal?oune and Hastyng. Twa of the thre desyryt to be kyng. Bal?oune clamyt of fyrst gre lynialy, And Bruce fyrst male of the secund gre by. To Paryse than and In Ingland thai send Of this gret striff how thai suld haif ane end. Foly it was forsuth it happynnyt sa, Succour to sek of thar alde mortale fa. Eduuarde Langschankis had new begune his wer Apon Gaskone, fell awfull in effer. Thai landis thane he clamde as heretage Fra tyme that he had semblit his barnage And herd tell weyle Scotland stude in sic cace, He thocht till hym to mak it playn conquace. Till Noramkirk he come withoutyn mar. The consell than of Scotland mett hym thar. Full sutailly he chargit thaim in bandoune As thar our-lord till hald of hym the croun. Byschope Robert, in his tyme full worthi, Off Glaskow lord, he said that “we deny Ony our-lord bot the gret god abuff.” The king was wrath and maid hym to ramuff. Couatus Bal?oune folowid on hym fast; Till hald of hym he granttyt at the last. In-contrar rycht a king he maid hym thar, Quhar-throuch Scotland rapentyt syne full sar. To Bal?oune ?hit our lordis wald nocht consent. Eduuard past south and gert sett his parliment. He callyt Bal?oune till ansuer for Scotland. The wys lordis gert hym sone brek that band. Ane Abbot past and gaif our this legiance. King Eduuard than it tuk in gret greuance, His ost he rasd and come to Werk on Twede, Bot for to fecht as than he had gret drede. To Corspatryk of Dunbar sone he send, His consell ast for he the contre kend, And he was brocht in presence to the king. Be sutalle band thai cordyt of this thing. Erle Patrik than till Berweik couth persew, Ressawide he was and trastyt werray trew. The king followid with his host of ranoun. Efftir mydnycht at Rest wes all the toun; Corspatrik rais, the keyis weile he knew, Leit breggis doun and portcules thai drew, Sett wp ?ettis syne, couth his baner schaw. The ost was war and towart hym thai draw. Eduuard entrit and gert sla hastely Off man and wiff vii thousand and fyfty, And barnys als. Be this fals awentur Of trew Scottis chapyt na creatur. A captayne thair this fals Eduuard has maid. Towart Dunbar without restyng thai raid, Quhar gaderyt was gret power of Scotland, Agayne Eduuard in bataill thocht to stand. Thir iiii Erllis was entrit in that place, Of Mar, Menteith, Adell, Ros wpon cace. In that Castell the Erle gert hald thaim In At to thar men with-out thai mycht nocht wyn, Na thai to thaim suppleying for to ma. The battaillis then to-giddyr fast thai ga; Full gret slauchtyr, at pitte was to se, Off trew Scottis oursett with sutelte. Erle Patrik than, quhen fechtyng was fellast, Till our fa turnd and harmyng did us mast. Is nayne in warld at scaithis ma do mar Than weile trastyt in-born familiar. Our men was slayne withoutyn redempcioune. Throuch thar dedis all tynt was this Regioune. King Eduuard past and Corspatrik to Scwne And thar he gat homage of Scotland swne, For nane was left the Realme for to defend. For Ihon the Bal?oune to Munros than he send And putt hym doune for euir of this kynrik. Than Eduuarde self was callit a Roy full ryk. The croune he tuk apon that sammyne stane At Gadalos send with his sone fra Spane, Quhen Iber Scot fyrst in-till Irland come. At Canmor syne king Fergus has it nome, Brocht it till Scwne and stapill maid it thar, Quhar kingis was cround viii hundyr ?er and mar Befor the tyme at king Eduuard it fand. This Iowell he gert turs in-till Ingland, In Lwnd it sett til witnes of this thing, Be conquest than of Scotland cald hym king. Quhar that stayne is Scottis suld mastir be. God ches the tyme Margretis ayr till see! Vii scor thai led of the gretast that thai fand Off ayris with thaim, and Bruce, out of Scotland. Eduuard gayf hym his fadris heretage Bot he thocht ay till hald hym in thrillage. Baith Blacow mur was his and Huntyntoun. Till Erle Patrik thai gaif full gret gardoun. For the frendschipe king Eduuard wyth hym fand Protector haile he maid hym of Scotland. That office than he brukyt bot schort tyme. I may nocht now putt all thar deid in Ryme. Off Cornikle quhat suld I tary lang? To Wallace agayne now breiffly will I gange. Scotland was lost quhen he was bot a child And our-set throuch with our ennemys wilde. His fadyr Malcom in the Lennox fled. His eldest sone thedyr he with hym led. His modyr fled wyth hym fra Elrisle, Till Gowry past and duelt in Kilspynde. The knycht hir fadyr thedyr he thaim sent Till his wncle, that with full gud entent In Gowry duelt and had gud lewyng thar, Ane agyt man the quhilk resawyt thaim far. In-till Dunde Wallace to scule thai send Quhill he of witt full worthely was kend. Thus he conteynde in-till his tendyr age, In armys syne did mony hie waslage, Quhen Saxons blud in-to this Realm couth ring Wyrkand the will of Eduuard, that fals king. Mony gret wrang thai wrocht in this Regioune; Distroyed our lordys and brak thar byggynys doun; Both wiffis, wedowis, thai tuk all at thar will, Nonnys, madyns, quham thai likit to spill. King Herodis part thai playit in-to Scotland Off ?ong childyr that thai befor thaim fand. The byschoprykis that war of gretast waile Thai tuk in hand of thar archybyschops haile; No for the pape thai wald no kyrkis forber Bot gryppyt all be wiolence of wer. Glaskow thai gaif, as it our weile was kend, To dyocye in Duram to commend. Small benifice, that wald thai nocht persew! And for the richt full worthy clerkis thai slew, Hangitt barrownnys and wrocht full mekill cayr. It was weylle knawyn, in the bernys of Ayr, Xviii score putt to that dispitfull dede! Bot god abowyn has send ws sum ramede. The Remembrance is forthir in the taile. I will folow apon my proces haile. Will?ham Wallace or he was man of armys Gret pitte thocht that Scotland tuk sic harmys. Mekill dolour it did hym in his mynd, For he was wys, rycht worthy, wicht and kynd. In Gowry duelt still with this worthy man. As he encressyt and witt haboundyt than In-till his hart he had full mekill cayr, He saw the Sothroun multipliand mayr, And to hym-self offt wald he mak his mayne. Off his gud kyne thai had slane mony ane. ?hit he was than semly, stark and bauld, And he of age was bot xviii ?er auld. Wapynnys he bur, othir gud suerd or knyff, For he with thaim hapnyt rycht offt in stryff. Quhar he fand ane withoutyn othir presance Eftir to Scottis that did no mor grewance. To cutt his thrott or steik hym sodanlye He wayndyt nocht, fand he thaim sawely. Syndry wayntyt, bot nane wyst be quhat way; For all to him thar couth na man thaim say. Sad of contenance he was bathe auld and ?ing, Litill of spech, wys, curtas and benyng. Wpon a day to Dunde he was send. Off cruelnes full litill thai him kend. The constable, a felloun man of wer, That to the Scottis he did full mekill der, Selbye he hecht, dispitfull and owtrage. A sone he had ner xx?? ?er of age, In-to the toun he vsyt euirilk day. Thre men or four thar went with him to play, A hely schrew, wanton in his entent. Wallace he saw and towart him he went. Likle he was, rycht byge and weyle beseyne In-till a gyde of gudly ganand greyne. He callyt on hym and said, “Thow Scot, abyde. Quha dewill the grathis in so gay a gyde? Ane Ersche mantill it war thi kynd to wer, A Scottis thewtill undyr thi belt to ber, Rouch rewlyngis apon thi harlot fete. Gyff me thi knyff. Quhat dois thi ger so mete?” Till him he ?eid his knyff to tak him fra. Fast by the collar Wallace couth him ta, Wndyr his hand the knyff he bradit owt, For all his men that semblyt him about, Bot help him-selff he wyst of no remede. With-out reskew he stekyt him to dede. The squier fell, of him thar was na mar. His men folowid on Wallace wondir sar. The pres was thik and cummirit thaim full fast. Wallace was spedy and gretlye als agast, The bludy knyff bar drawin in his hand. He sparyt nane that he befor him fand. He knew the hous his eyme had lugit In; Thedir he fled for owt he mycht nocht wyn. The gude wyff than within the clos saw he And “Help,” he cryit, “for him that deit on tre. The ?ong captane has fallyn with me at stryff.” In at the dure he went with this gud wiff. A roussat goun of hir awn scho him gaif Apon his weyd at coueryt all the layff, A soudly courche our hed and nek leit fall; A wowyn quhyt hatt scho brassit on with-all, For thai suld nocht lang tary at that In; Gaiff him a rok, syn set him doun to spyn. The Sothroun socht quhar Wallace was in drede. Thai wyst nocht weylle at quhat ?ett he in ?eide. In that same hous thai socht him beselye Bot he sat still and span full conandly— As of his tym, for he nocht leryt lang. Thai left him swa and furth thar gait can gang With hewy cheyr and sorowfull in thocht. Mar witt of him as than get couth thai nocht. The Inglismen all thus in barrat boune Bade byrn all Scottis that war in-to that toun. ?hit this gud wiff held Wallace till the nycht, Maid him gud cher, syne put hym out with slycht. Throw a dyrk garth scho gydyt him furth fast; In cowart went and vp the watter past, Forbure the gate for wachis that war thar. His modyr bade in-till a gret dispar. Quhen scho him saw scho thankit hewynnis queyn And said, “Der sone, this lang quhar has thow beyne?” He tald his modyr of his sodane cas. Than wepyt scho and said full oft, “Allas! Or that thow cess thow will be slayne with-all.” “Modyr,” he said, “god reuller is of all. Unsouerable ar thir pepille of Ingland. Part of thar Ire me think we suld gaynstand.” His eme wist weyle that he the squier slew; For dreid thar-of in gret languor he grew. This passit our quhill diuers dayis war gane. That gud man dred or Wallace suld be tane, For Suthroun ar full sutaille euerilk man. A gret dyttay for Scottis thai ordand than, Be the lawdayis in Dunde set ane ayr. Than Wallace wald na langar soiorne thar. His modyr graithit hir in pilgrame weid, Hym self disgysyt syne glaidlye with hir ?eid, A schort swerd wndyr his weid preuale. In all that land full mony fays had he. Baith on thar fute, with thaim may tuk thai nocht; Quha sperd, scho said to sanct Margret thai socht. Quha serwit hir, full gret frendschipe thai fand With Sothroun folk, for scho was of Ingland. Besyd Lundoris the ferrye our thai past, Syn throw the Ochtell sped thaim wondir fast. In Dunfermlyn thai lugyt all that nycht. Apon the morn quhen that the day was brycht, With gentill wemen hapnyt thaim to pas, Off Ingland born, in Lithquhow wounnand was. The captans wiff, in pilgramage had beyne, Fra scho thaim mett and had ?ong Wallace sene, Gud cher thaim maid, for he was wondyr fayr, Nocht large of tong, weille taucht and debonayr; Furth tawkand thus of materis that was wrocht Quhill south our Forth with hyr son scho thaim brocht. In-to Lithkow thai wald nocht tary lang, Thar leyff thai tuk, to Dunypace couth gang, Thar duelt his Eyme, a man of gret Riches. This mychty persone, hecht to name Wallas, Maid thaim gud cher and was a full kynd man, Welcwmmyt thaim fair and to thaim tald he than, Dide him to witt, the land was all on ster; Trettyt thaim weyle, and said, “My sone so der, Thi modyr and thow rycht heir with me sall bide Quhill better be, for chance at may betyde.” Wallace ansuerd, said, “Westirmar we will, Our kyne ar slayne and that me likis ill, And othir worthi mony in that art. Will god I leiffe we sall us wreke on part.” The persone sicht and said, “My sone so fre, I can nocht witt how that radres may be.” Quhat suld I spek of fruster? As this tid For gyft of gud with him he wald nocht bide. His modyr and he till Elrisle thai went. Upon the morn scho for hir brothir sent, In Corsby duelt and schirreff was of Ayr. Hyr fadyr was dede, a lang tyme leyffyt had thar. Hyr husband als at Lowdon hill was slayn. Hyr eldest son that mekill was of mayn, Schir Malcolm Wallas was his nayme but less, His houch senons thai cuttyt in that press. On kneis he faucht, felle Inglismen he slew. Till hym thar socht may fechtaris than anew, On athyr side with speris bar him doun. Thar stekit thai that gud knycht of Renoun. On to my taile I left, at Elrisle Schir Ranald come son till his sistir fre, Welcwmmyt thaim hayme and sperd of hir entent. Scho prayde he wald to the lord Persye went, So yrk of wer scho couth no forthir fle, To purches pes in rest at scho mycht be. Schyr Ranald had the Perseys proteccioune, As for all part to tak the remissioune. He gert wrytt ane till his systir that tyde. In that respyt Wallace wald nocht abyde, Hys modyr kyst; scho wepyt with hart sar; His leyff he tuk, syne with his Eyme couth far. ?onge he was and to Sothroun rycht sauage. Gret rowme thai had, dispitfull and owtrage. Schir Ranald weylle durst nocht hald Wallas thar For gret perell he wyst apperand war. For thai had haile the strenthis of Scotland, Quhat thai wald do durst few agayne thaim stand. Schyrreff he was and wsyt thaim amang. Full sar he dred or Wallas suld tak wrang, For he and thai couth neuir weyle accord. He gat a blaw, thocht he war lad or lord, That profferyt him ony lychtlynes. Bot thai raparyt our mekill to that place. Als Inglis clerkis in prophecys thai fand How a Wallace suld putt thame of Scotland. Schir Ranald knew weill a mar quiet sted Quhar Wil?ham mycht be bettir fra thar fede, With his wncle, Wallas of Ricardtoun. Schir Richart hecht that gud knycht off renoun. Thai landis hayle than was his heretage. Bot blynd he was; so hapnyt throw curage, Be Inglismen that dois ws mekill der— In his rysyng he worthi was in wer— Throuch-hurt of waynys and mystynit of blude. ?eit he was wis and of his conseill gud. In Feuir?er Wallas was to him send; In Aperill fra him he bownd to wend. Bot gud serwice he dide him with plesance As in that place was worthi to awance. So on a tym he desyrit to play. In Aperill the thre and twentie day Till Erewyn wattir fysche to tak he went, Sic fantasye fell in his entent. To leide his net a child furth with him ?eid, Bot he or nowne was in a felloune dreid. His suerd he left, so did he neuir agayne; It dide him gud suppos he sufferyt payne. Off that labour as than he was nocht sle; Happy he was, tuk fysche haboundanle. Or of the day x houris our couth pas, Ridand thar come ner-by quhar Wallace was The lorde Persye, was captane than off Ayr. Fra thine he turnde and couth to Glaskow fair. Part of the court had Wallace labour seyne. Till him raid v cled in-to ganand greyne. Ane said sone, “Scot, Martyns fysche we wald hawe.” Wallace meklye agayne ansuer him gawe, “It war resone me think ?he suld haif part. Waith suld be delt in all place with fre hart.” He bade his child, “Gyff thaim of our waithyng.” The Sothroun said, “As now of thi delyng We will nocht tak; thow wald giff ws our small.” He lychtyt doun and fra the child tuk all. Wallas said than, “Gentill men gif ?e be, Leiff ws sum part, we pray, for cheryte. Ane agyt knycht serwis our lady to-day. Gud frend, leiff part and tak nocht all away.” “Thow sall haiff leiff to fysche and tak the ma. All this forsuth sall in our flyttyng ga. We serff a lord. Thir fysche sall till him gang.” Wallace ansuerd, said, “Thow art in the wrang.” “Quham dowis thow, Scot? In faith thow serwis a blaw.” Till him he ran and out a suerd can draw. Will?ham was wa he had na wapynnis thar Bot the poutstaff the quhilk in hand he bar. Wallas with it fast on the cheik him tuk Wyth so gud will quhill of his feit he schuk. The suerd flaw fra him a fur breid on the land. Wallas was glaid and hynt it sone in hand, And with the swerd ane awkwart straik him gawe, Wndyr the hat his crage in sondir drawe. Be that the layff lychtyt about Wallas. He had no helpe only bot goddis grace. On athir side full fast on him thai dange. Gret perell was giff thai had lestyt lang. Apone the hede in gret Ire he strak ane; The scherand suerd glaid to the colar bane. Ane othir on the arme he hitt so hardely Quhill hand and suerd bathe on the feld can ly. The tothir twa fled to thar hors agayne. He stekit him was last apon the playne. Thre slew he thar, twa fled with all thar mycht Eftir thar lord, bot he was out off sicht Takand the mure or he and thai couth twyne. Till him thai raid onon or thai wald blyne And cryit, “Abide, ?our men ar martyrit doun Rycht cruelly her in this fals regioun. V of our court her at the wattir baid Fysche for to bryng, thocht it na profyt maid. We ar chapyt, bot in feyld slayne ar thre.” The lord speryt, “How mony mycht thai be?” “We saw bot ane that has discwmfyst ws all.” Than lewch he lowde and said, “Foule mot ?ow fall, Sen ane ?ow all has putt to confusioun. Quha menys it maist the dewyll of hell him droun! This day for me in faith he beis nocht socht.” Quhen Wallace thus this worthi werk had wrocht, Thar hors he tuk and ger that lewyt was thar, Gaif our that crafft, he ?eid to fysche no mar; Went till his eyme and tauld him of this drede, And he for wo weyle ner worthit to weide, And said, “Sone, thir tithingis syttis me sor, And be it knawin thow may tak scaith tharfor.” “Wncle,” he said, “I will no langar bide. Thir south-land hors latt se gif I can ride.” Than bot a child him seruice for to mak, Hys emys sonnys he wald nocht with him tak. This gud knycht said, “Deyr Cusyng, pray I the, Quhen thow wanttis gud cum fech ynewch fra me.” Syluir and gold he gert on-to him geyff. Wallace Inclynis and gudely tuk his leyff. BOOK II ?ong Wallace, fulfillit of hie curage, In prys of armys desirous and sauage, Thi Waslage may neuir be forlorn, Thi deidis ar knawin thocht that the Warld had suorn; For thi haile mynde, labour and besynes, Was set in Wer and werray rychtwisnes, And felloune los of thi deyr-worthi kyn. The Rancour more remaynde his mynde with-in. It was his lyff and maist part of his fude To se thame sched the byrnand Sothroun blude. Till Auchincruff with-outyn mar he raid, And bot schort tyme in pes at he thar baid. Thar duelt a Wallas welcwmmyt him full weill, Thocht Inglismen thar-of had litill feille. Bathe meite and drynk at his will he had thar In Laglyne wode quhen that he maid Repayr. This gentill man was full oft his Resett; With stuff of houshald strestely he thaim bett. So he desirit the toune of Air to se. His child with him, as than na ma had he. Ay next the wode Wallace gert leiff his hors, Syne on his feit ?eid to the merkat cors. The Persye was in the castell of Ayr, With Inglismen gret nowmer and repayr. Our all the toune rewlyng on thar awne wis Till mony Scot thai did full gret suppris. Abandounly Wallace amang thaim ?eid. The Rage of ?outh maid him to haf no dreid. A churll thai had that felloune byrdyngis bar. Excedandlye he wald lyft mekill mar Than ony twa that thai amang thame fand, And als be ws a sport he tuk on hand: He bar a sasteing in a boustous poille, In his braid bak of ony wald he thoille, Bot for a grot, als fast as he mycht draw. Quhen Wallas herd spek of that mery saw, He likit weill at that mercat to be And for a strak he bad him grottis thre. The churll grantyt, of that proffyr was fayn. To pay the siluir Wallas was full bayne. Wallas that steing tuk wp in-till his hand. Full sturdely he coud befor him stand. Wallace with that apon the bak him gaif, Till his ryg bayne he all in sondyr draif. The Carll wes dede. Of him I spek no mar. The Inglismen semblit on Wallace thair, Feill on the feld of frekis fechtand fast, He unabasyt and nocht gretlie agast. Apon the hed ane with the steing hitt he, Till bayn and brayn he gert in pecis fle. Ane othir he straik on a basnat of steille; The tre to-raiff and fruschit euire-deille. His steyng was tynt, the Inglisman was dede, For his crag bayne was brokyn in that stede. He drew a suerd at helpit him at neide. Throuch-oute the thikest of the pres he ?eid And at his hors full fayne he wald haif beyne. Twa sarde him maist that cruell war and keyne. Wallace raturnd as man of mekyll mayne And at a straik the formast has he slayne The tothir fled and durst him nocht abide, Bot a rycht straik Wallas him gat that tyd. In at the guschet brymly he him bar; The grounden suerd throuch-out his cost it schar. V slew he thar or that he left the toune. He gat his hors, to Laglyne maid him boune, Kepyt his child and leyt him nocht abide, In saufte thus on to the wod can ride. Feille folowit him on hors and eik on futte To tak Wallace, bot than it was no butte. Couert of treis sawit him full weille, Bot thar to bid than coude he nocht adeille. Gud ordinance that serd for his estate His cusyng maid at all tyme, ayr and late. The Squier Wallas in Auchincruff that was Baith bed and meite he maid for thame to pas As for that tyme that he remanyt thar. Bot sar he langit to se the toune of Ayr. Thedyr he past apon the mercate day. Gret god, gif he as than had beyne away! His emys serwand to by him fysche was send, Schir Ranald Craufurd, schireff than was kend. Quhen he had tane of sic gud as he bocht, The Perseys stwart sadly till him socht And said, “Thow Scot, to quhom takis thow this thing?” “To the schireff,” he said. “Be hewynnys king, My lord sall haiff it, and syne go seke the mar!” Wallace on gaite ner by was walkand thar. Till him he ?eid, said, “Gud freynd, pray I the, The schirreffis serwand thow wald lat him be.” A hetfull man the stwart was of blude And thocht Wallace chargyt him in termys rude: “Go hens, thow Scot, the mekill dewill the speid! At thi schrewed ws thow wenys me to leid.” A huntyn staff in-till his hand he bar. Thar-with he smat on Will?ham Wallace thair, Bot for his tre litill son?he he maid Bot be the coler claucht him with-outyn baid; A felloun knyff fast till his hart straik he, Syn fra him dede schot him doun sodanli. Catour sen syne he was but weyr no mar. Men of armes on Wallace semblit thar, Four scor, was sett in armys buskyt boun On the merket day for Scottis to kepe the toun, Bot Wallace bauldlye drew a suerd of wer. In-to the byrneis the formast can he ber, Throuch-out the body stekit him to dede, And syndry ma or he past of that stede; Ane othir aukwart a sarye straik tuk thar, Abown the kne the bayne in sondir schar. The thrid he straik throuch his pissand of maile The crag in twa; no weidis mycht him waill. Thus Wallace ferd als fers as a lyoun. Than Inglismen that war in bargane boun To kepe the gait, with speris rud and lang— For dynt of suerd thai durst nocht till hym gang; Wallace was harnest In his body weyle— Till him thai socht with hedis scharp of steyle And fra his strenth enweronde him about. Bot throu the pres on a side he went out In-till a wall that stude by the se syde; For weyle or wo thar most he nedis abide, And off thar speris in pecis part he schar. Than fra the castell othir help come mar. A-tour the dike thai ?eid on athir side, Schott doun the wall; no socour was that tyde. Than wist he nocht of no help bot to de. To wenge his dede amang thaim lous ?eid he, On athyr part in gret Ire hewand fast. Hys byrnyst brand to-byrstyt at the last, Brak in the heltis, away the blaid it flaw. He wyst na wayne bot out his knyff can draw. The fyrst he slew that him in hand has hynt And othir twa he stekit with his dynt. The Ramanand with speris to him socht, Bar him to ground; than forthir mycht he nocht. The lordis bad that thai suld nocht him sla. To pyne him mar thai chargyt him to ta. Thus in thar armys, suppos that he had suorn, Out off the garth be fors thai haff him born. Thus gud Wallace with Inglismen was tane In falt of helpe for he was him allayne. He coud nocht cheys, sic curage so hym bar. Frewill fortoun thus brocht him in the suar, And fals Inwye ay contrar rychtwisnes, That wiolent god full of doubilnes. Thai fen?eit goddis Wallace neuir knew. Gret rychtwisnes him ay to mercy drew. His kyn mycht nocht him get for na kyn thing, Mycht thai hawe payit the Ransoune of a king. The more thai bad the mor it was in wayne. Off thar best men that day vii has he slayne. Thai gert set him in-till a presoune sell. Off his turment gret payne it war to tell. Ill meyt and drynk thai gert on-till him giff. Gret merwaille was lang tyme gif he mycht leyff; And ek thar-to he was in presoune law Quhill thai thocht tyme on him to hald the Law. Leyff I him thus in-to that paynfull sted. Gret god abowe, till him send sum ramede! The playne compleynt, the pittows wementyng, The wofull wepyng that was for his takyng, The tormentyng of euery creatur! “Alas,” thai said, “how suld our lyff endur? The flour of ?outh in-till his tendir age, Be fortoun armes has left him in thrillage. Lefand as now a chifftane had we nane Durst tak on hand bot ?oung Wallace alane. This land is lost, he caucht is in the swar. Prophesye out, Scotland is lost in cayr.” Barrell heryng and wattir thai him gawe Quhar he was set in-to that ugly cawe. Sic fude for him was febill to comend. Than said he thus, “All-weildand god resawe My petows spreit and sawle amange the lawe. My carneill lyff I may nocht thus defend. Our few Sothroune on-to the dede I drawe. Quhen-so thow will out of this warld I wend, Giff I suld now in presoune mak ane end! Eternaile god, quhy suld I thus-wayis de, Syne my beleiff all haile remanys in the, At thin awn will full worthely was wrocht? Bot thow rademe, na liff thai ordand me. Gastlye fadyr that deit apon the tre, Fra hellis presoune with thi Blud ws bocht, Quhi will thow giff thi handewerk for nocht, And mony worthy in-to gret payne we se, For off my lyff ellys no thing I roucht? O wareide suerd, of tempyr neuir trew! Thi fruschand blaid in presoune sone me threw, And Inglismen our litill harme has tane. Off ws thai haiff wndoyne may than ynew! My faithfull fadyr dispitfully thai slew, My brothir als and gud men mony ane. Is this thi dait? Sall thai ourcum ilkane? On our kynrent, deyr god, quhen will thow rew, Sen my pouir thus sodandlye is gane? All worthi Scottis, all-michty god thow leid, Sen I no mor in wyage may ?ou speid. In presoune heir me worthis to myscheyff. Sely Scotland, that of help has gret neide, The nacioune all standis in a felloun dreid. Off warldlynes all thus I tak my leiff. Off thir paynys god lat ?ou neuir preiff, Thocht I for wo all out off witt suld weid! Now othir gyft I may none to ?ou gyff.” O der Wallace, umquhill was stark and stur, Thow most on neide in presoune till endur. Thi worthi kyn may nocht the saiff for sold. Ladyis wepyt that was bathe myld and mur, In fureous payne the modyr that the bur, For thou till hir was fer derer than gold. Hyr most desyr was to be wndyr mold. In warldlynes quhi suld ony ensur, For thow was formyt forsye on the fold! Compleyne, sanctis, thus as ?our sedull tellis; Compleyn to hewyn with wordis that nocht fell-is; Compleyne ?our woice wnto the god abuffe; Compleyne for him in-to that sitfull sell is; Compleyne his payne in dolour thus that duellis, In langour lyis for losyng of thar luff. His fureous payne was felloune for to pruff. Compleyne also ?he birdis blyth as bellis; Sum happy chance may fall for ?our behuff. Compleyne lordys, compleyne ?he ladyis brycht, Compleyne for him that worthi was and wycht, Off Saxons sonnys sufferyt full mekill der; Compleyne for him was thus in presone dicht, And for na caus bot, Scotland, for thi richt. Compleyne also ?he worthi men of wer; Compleyne for him that was ?our aspresper And to the dede fell Sothron ?eit he dicht; Compleyne for him ?our triumphe had to ber. Celinius was maist his geyeler now. In Inglismen allace quhi suld we trow, Our worthy kyn has payned on this wys? Sic reulle be rycht is litill till allow. Me think we suld in barrat mak thaim bow At our power, and so we do feill sys. Off thar danger god mak ws for to rys, That weill has wrocht befor thir termys and now, For thai wyrk ay to wayt ws with supprys. Quhat suld I mor of Wallace turment tell? The flux he tuk in-to that presoune fell. Ner to the Dede he was likly to drawe. Thai chargyt the geyler nocht on him to duell, Bot bryng him wp out of that ugly sell To Iugisment, quhar he suld thoill the law. This man went doun and sodanlye he saw, As to his sycht, dede had him swappyt snell, Syn said to thaim, “He has payit at he aw.” Quhen thai presumyt he suld be werray ded, Thai gart serwandys, withoutyn langer pleid, Wyth schort awis, on-to the wall him bar. Thai kest him our out off that bailfull steid— Off him thai trowit suld be no mor ramede— In a draff myddyn, quhar he remannyt thar. His fyrst norys, of the Newtoun of Ayr, Till him scho come, quhilk was full will of reid, And thyggyt leiff away with him to fayr. In-to gret Ire thai grantyt hir to go. Scho tuk him wp withoutin wordis mo And on a caar wnlikly thai him cast; Atour the wattir led him with gret woo Till hyr awn hous, withoutyn ony hoo. Scho warmyt wattir, and hir serwandis fast His body wousche quhill filth was of hym past. His hart was wicht and flykeryt to and fro, Als his twa eyne he kest wp at the last. His fostir-modyr lowed him our the laiff, Did mylk to warme, his liff giff scho mycht saiff, And with a spoyn gret kyndnes to him kyth. Hyr dochtir, had of xii wokkis ald a knayff, Hir childis pape in Wallace mouth scho gaiff. The womannys mylk recomford him full swyth. Syn in a bed thai brocht him fair and lyth. Rycht couertly thai kepe him in that caiff, Him for to sawe so secretlye thai mycht. In thar chawmyr thai kepyt him that tide. Scho gert graith wp a burd be the hous side Wyth carpettis cled and honowryt with gret lycht; And for the woice in euiry place suld bide At he was ded, out throw the land so wide, On presence ay scho wepyt wndyr slycht. Bot gudely meytis scho graithit him at hir mycht. And so befell in-to that sammyn tid Quhill forthirmar at Wallas worthit wycht. Thomas Rimour in-to the Faile was than With the mynystir, quhilk was a worthi man. He wsyt offt to that religious place. The peple demyt of Witt mekill he can; And so he told, thocht at thai blis or ban, Quhilk hapnyt suth in mony diuers cace, I can nocht say be wrang or rychtwisnas, In rewlle of wer quhethir thai tynt or wan. It may be demyt be diuisioun of grace. Thar man, that day had in the merket bene, On Wallace knew this cairfull cas so kene. His mastir speryt quhat tithingis at he saw. This man ansuerd, “Of litill hard I meyn.” The mynister said, “It has bene seildyn seyn, Quhar Scottis and Inglis semblit bene on Raw, Was neuir ?it, als fer as we coud knaw, Bot othir a Scot wald do a Sothroun teyn Or he till him, for awentur mycht faw.” “Wallas,” he said, “?e wist tayne in that steid, Out our the wall I saw thaim cast him deide, In thar presoune famyst for fawt of fude.” The mynister said with hart hewy as leid, “Sic deid to thaim me think suld foster feid, For he was wicht and cummyn of gentill blud.” Thomas ansuerd, “Thir tithingis ar noucht gud. And that be suth my self sall neuir eit breid, For all my witt her schortlye I conclud.” “A woman syne of the Newtoun of Ayr Till him scho went fra he was fallyn thar, And on hir kneis rycht lawly thaim besocht To purches leiff scho mycht thin with him fayr. In lychtlynes tyll hyr thai grant to fayr. Our the Wattyr on-till hir hous him brocht, To berys him als gudlye as scho mocht.” ?hit Thomas said, “Than sall I leiff na mar Gyff that be trew, be god that all has wrocht!” The mynister herd quhat Thomas said in playne. He chargyt him than, “Go speid the fast agayn To that sammyn hous and werraly aspye.” The man went furth, at byddyng was full bayn. To the Newtoun to pas he did his payn, To that ilk hous, and went in sodanlye. About he blent on-to the burd him bye. This woman rais. In hart scho was nocht fayn. “Quha aw this lik?,” he bad hir nocht deny. “Wallace,” scho said, “that full worthy has beyne.” Than wepyt scho that pete was to seyne. The man thar-till gret credens gaif he nocht. Towart the burd he bowned as he war teyne. On kneis scho felle and cryit, “For Marye scheyne, Lat sklandyr be and flemyt out of ?our thocht.” This man hir suour, “Be him that all has wrocht, Mycht I on lyff him anys se with myn eyn He suld be saiff thocht Ingland had him socht!” Scho had him wp to Wallace be the des. He spak with him, syne fast agayne can pres With glaid bodword thar myrthis till amend. He told to thaim the fyrst tithingis was les. Than Thomas said, “Forsuth, or he deces, Mony thousand in feild sall mak thar end. Off this regioune he sall the Sothroun send, And Scotland thris he sall bryng to the pes. So gud off hand agayne sall neuir be kend.” All worthi men that has gud witt to waille, Be war that ?he with mys deyme nocht my taille. Perchance ?e say that Bruce he was none sik. He was als gud, quhat deid was to assaill, As off his handis, and bauldar in battaill, Bot Bruce was knawin weyll ayr off this kynrik; For he had rycht we call no man him lik. Bot Wallace thris this kynrik conquest haile, In Ingland fer socht battaill on that rik. I will ratorn to my mater agayne. Quhen Wallace was ralesched off his payn The contre demyd haile at he was dede, His derrest kyn nocht wist of his Ramede, Bot haile he was, likly to gang and ryd. In-to that place he wald no langar byde. His trew kepar he send to Elrisle. Eftir him thar he durst nocht lat thaim be. Hir dochtir als, thar serwand and hir child, He gart thaim pas on-to his modyr myld. Quhen thai war gayne, na wapynnys thar he saw To helpe him with, quhat auentur mycht be-faw. A rousty suerd in a noik he saw stand, Withoutyn Belt, but bos, bukler or band. Lang tyme befor it had beyne in that steid. Ane agyt man it left quhen he was dede. He drew the blaid; he fand it wald bitt weill, Thocht it was foule nobill it was of steyll: “God helpis his man, for thou sall go with me Quhill bettir cum, will god full sone may be!” To Schir Ranald as than he wald nocht fair, In that passage offt Sothroun maid Repar. At Rycardtoun full fayn he wald hawe beyne To get him hors and part of armour scheyne. On thedirwart as he bownyt to fair Thre Inglismen he met ridand till Ayr, In thair wiage at Glaskow furth had beyne; Ane Longcastell that cruell was and keyne, A bauld squier, with him gud ?emen twa. Wallace drew by and wald haiff lattyn thaim ga. Till him he raid and said dispitfully, “Thow Scot, abide. I trow thow be sum spy, Or ellis a theyff, fra presens wald the hid.” Than Wallace said with sobyr wordis that tid, “Schir, I am seik. For goddis luff latt me ga.” Longcastell said, “Forsuth it beis nocht sa. A felloune freik thow semys in thi fair. Quhill men the knaw thow sall with me till Ayr.” Hynt out his suerd that was of nobill hew. Wallace with that at his lychtyn him drew, Apon the crag with his suerd has him tayne, Throw brayne and seyne in sondir straik the bayne. Be he was fallyn the twa than lichtyt doun, To wenge his dede to Wallace maid thaim boun. The tayne of thaim apon the hed he gaiff. The rousty blaid to the schulderis him claiff. The tothir fled and durst no langar bide. With a rud step Wallace coud eftir glide. Out thourch his rybbis a seker straik drewe he, Quhill leuir and lounggis men mycht all redy se. Thar hors he tuk, bathe wapynnys and armour, Syne thankit god with gud hart in that stour. Syluir thai had, all with him has he tayne Him to support, for spendyng had he nayne. In-to gret haist he raid to Ricardtoun. A blyth semblay was at his lychtin doun. Quhen Wallace mett with schir Richart the knycht, For him had murnit quhill feblit was his mycht, His thre sonnys of Wallace was full fayne. Thai held him lost, ?it god him sawth agayne. His eyme, schir Ranald, to Rycardtoun come fast. The wemen told, by Corsby as thai past, Off Wallace eschaipe, syne thar wiage ?eid. Schyr Ranald ?it was in a felloune dreid. Quhill he him saw in hart he thocht full lang. Than sodanlye in armys he coud him fang. He mycht nocht spek bot kyst him tendirlye. The knychtis spreit was in ane extasye. The blyth teris tho bryst fro his eyne two; Or that he spak a lang tyme held him so, And at the last rycht freindfully said he, “Welcum, neuo, Welcum, deir sone, to me! Thankit be he that all this Warld has wrocht, Thus fairlye the has out of presoune brocht!” His modyr come and othir freyndis enew With full glaid will to feill thai tithingis trew. Gud Robert Boyd, that worthi was and wicht, Wald nocht thaim trow quhill he him saw with sicht. Fra syndry part thai socht to Ricardtoun, Feille worthi folk that war of gret renoun. Thus leiff I thaim in myrth, blys and plesance, Thankand gret god off his fre happy chance. BOOK III In Ioyows Iulii, quhen the flouris suete, Degesteable engenered throu the heet, Baith erbe and froyte, busk and bewis, braid Haboundandlye in euiry slonk and slaid; Als bestiall thar rycht cours till endur Weyle helpyt ar be wyrkyn off natur, On fute and weynge ascendand to the hycht, Conserwed weill be the makar of mycht; Fyscheis in flude refeckit realye Till mannys fude the warld suld occupye; Bot Scotland sa was waistit mony day, Throw wer sic skaith at labour was away. Wictaill worth scant or August could apper, Throu all the land that fude was hapnyt der. Bot Inglismen, that Riches wantyt nayne, Be caryage brocht thar wictaill full gud wayne, Stuffit housis with wyn and gud wernage, Demaynde this land as thar awne heretage. The kynryk haile thai rewllyt at thar will. Messyngeris than sic tithingis brocht thaim till And tald Persye that Wallace leffand war, Off his eschaip fra thar presoune in Ayr. Thai trowit rycht weill he passit was that steid, For Longcastell and his twa men war deid. Thai waryit the chance that Wallace so was past. In Ilka part thai war gretlye agast Throw prophesye that thai had herd befor. Lord Persye said, “Quhat nedis wordis mor? Bot he be cest he sall do gret merwaill. It war the best for king Eduuardis awaill Mycht he him get to be his steidfast man, For gold or land; his conquest mycht lest than. Me think beforce he may nocht gottyn be. Wysmen the suth be his eschaip may se.” Thus deyme thai him in mony diuers cas. We leiff thaim her and spek furth off Wallas. In Rycardtoun he wald no langar byde For freindis consaill nor thing that mycht betide; And quhen thai saw that it awaillit nocht, His purpos was to wenge him at he mocht On Sothron blud quhilk has his eldris slayne, Thai latt him wyrk his awn will in-to playne. Schir Richart had thre sonnys as I ?ow tald, Adam, Rychart and Symont, that was bald. Adam eldest was growand in curage, Forthward, rycht fayr, xviii ?er of age, Large off persone, bathe wis, worthi and wicht. Gude king Robert in his tyme maid him knycht. Lang tyme eft in Brucis weris he baid, On Inglismen mone gud Iorne maid. This gud squier with Wallace bound to ryd, And Robert Boid quhilk wald no langar bide Undir thrillage of Segis of Ingland. To that fals king he had neuir maid band. Kneland was thar, ner cusyhg to Wallace, Syne baid with him in mony peralous place, And Eduuard Litill his sistir sone so der. Full weill graithit in-till thar armour cler, Wyth thar serwandis fra Ricardtoun thai raid To Mawchtlyne mur and schort tyme thar abaid, For freindis thaim tauld, was bound wndir trewage, That Fenweik was for Perseys caryage: With-in schort tyme he will bryng it till Ayr Out of Carleile; he had resawyt it thair. That plesyt Wallace in his hart gretumlye. Wytt ?he, thai war a full glaid cumpanye. Towart Lowdoun thai bownyt thaim to ride And in a schaw a litill thar besyde Thai lugyt thaim, for it was nere the nycht, To wache the way als besyly as thai mycht. A trew Scot quhilk hosteler hous thair held Wndir Lowdoun, as myn autor me teld, He saw thar come, syne went to thaim in hye. Baithe meite and drynk he brocht full prewalye And to thaim tald the cariage in-to playn. Thair for-rydar was past till Ayr agayne, Left thaim to cum with pouer of gret waille. Thai trowit be than thai war in Awendaille. Wallace than said, “We will nocht soiorne her, Nor change no weid bot our ilk dayis ger.” At Corssencon the gait was spilt that tide, Forthi that way behowid thaim for to ride. Ay fra the tyme that he of presoune four Gude souir weide dayly on him he wour; Gude lycht harnes fra that tyme wsyt he euir, For sodeyn stryff fra it he wald nocht seuir. A habergione undir his goune he war, A steylle capleyne in his bonet but mar, And glowis of plait in claith war couerit weill, In his doublet a clos coler off steyle. His face he kepit, for it was euir bar, With his twa handis the quhilk full worthi war. In-to his weid and he come in a thrang Was na man than on fute mycht with him gang. So growane in pith, off pouer stark and stur, His terryble dyntis war awfull till endur. Thai trastyt mar in Wallace him allane Than in a hundreth mycht be off Ingland tane. The worthi Scottis maid thar no soiornying, To Lowdoun hill past in the gray dawyng, Dewysyt the place and putt thar hors thaim fra And thocht to wyn or neuir thin to ga; Send twa skowrrouris to wesy weyll the playne, Bot thai rycht sone raturnde in agayne, To Wallace tald that thai war cummand fast. Than thai to grounde all kneland at the last, With humyll hartis prayit with all thar mycht To god abowne, to help thaim in thar rycht. Than graithit thai thaim till harnes hastely. Thar son?eit nane of that gud chewalrye. Than Wallace said, “Her was my fadir slayne, My brothir als, quhilk dois me mekill payne; So sall my selff, or wengit be but dreid. The traytour is her, causer was off that deid.” Than hecht thai all to bide with hartlye will. Be that the power was takand Lowdoun hill. The knycht Fenweik, conwoide the caryage, He had on Scottis maid mony schrewide wiage. The sone was rysyne our landis schenand brycht. The Inglismen so thai come to the hycht Ner thaim he raid and sone the Scottis saw. He tald his men and said to thaim on raw, “?honne is Wallace that chapit our presoune. He sall agayne and be drawyn throu the toune. His hede mycht mar, I wait weill, ples the king Than gold or land or ony warldly thing.” He gart serwandis bide with the cariage still. Thai thocht to dawntyt the Scottis at thar will. Nyne scor he led in harnes burnyst brycht, And fyfty was with Wallace in the rycht. Unraboytit the Sothroun was in wer And fast thai come fell awfull in affer. A maner dyk off stanys thai had maid Narrowyt the way, quhar-throuch thai thikar raid. The Scottis on fute tuke the feld thaim befor. The Sothroun saw; thar curage was the mor. In prydefull Ire thai thoucht our thaim to ryde, Bot othir-wys it hapnyt in that tide. On athir side to-giddyr fast thai glaid. The Scottis on fute gret rowme about thaim maide, With pon?eand speris throuch platis prest of steylle. The Inglismen that thocht to weng thaim weylle The harnest hors about thaim rudely raide, That with wnes wpone thar feit thai baid. Wallace the formast in the birny bar. The grounden sper throuch-out his body schar. The schafft to-schonkit off the fruschand tre. Dewoydyde sone sen na better mycht be, Drew suerdis syne bathe hewy scharp and lang. On athyr syd full cruelly thai dang, Fechtand at anys in-to that felloune dout. Than Inglismen enverounid thaim about, Beforce etlyt throuch-out thaim for to ryde. The Scottis on fute that baldly couth abyde With suerdis schar throuch habergeons full gude. Upon the flouris schot the schonkan blude Fra hors and men throw harnes burnyst beyne. A sayr sail?e forsuth thar mycht be seyne. Thai traistyt na liff bot the lettir end. Off sa few folk gret nobilnes was kend, To-gyddyr baid defendand thaim full fast. Durst nane seuir quhill the maist pres was past. The Inglismen that besye was in wer Befors ordand in sondyr thaim to ber. Thair cheyff chyftan feryt als fers as fyr Throw matelent and werray propyr Ire; On a gret hors in-till his glitterand ger In fewtir kest a fellone aspre sper: The knycht Fenweik that cruell was and keyne, He had at dede off Wallace fadyr beyne And his brodyr that douchty was and der. Quhen Wallace saw that fals knycht was so ner His corage grew in Ire as a lyoune. Till him he ran and fell frekis bar he doune. As he glaid by aukwart he couth him ta, The gud arsone in sondir gart he ga. Fra the coursour he fell on the fer syd. With a staff suerd Boyd stekit him that tyde. Or he was dede the gret pres come so fast Our him to grounde thai bur Boyde at the last. Wallace was ner and ratornde agayne Him to reskew till that he rais off playne, Wichtly him wor quhill he a suerd had tayne. Throu-out the stour thir twa in feyr ar gayne. The ramanand apon thaim folowit fast, In thar passage fell Sothron maid agast. Adam Wallace the ayr off Ricardtoun Straik ane Bewmound a squier of renoun On the pyssan with his brand burnyst bar. The thrusande blaid his hals in sonder schayr. The Inglismen, thocht thar chyftayn was slayne, Bauldly thai baid as men mekill off mayn. Reth hors repende rouschede frekis wndyr feit. The Scottis on fute gert mony lois the suete. Wicht men lichtyt thaim selff for to defend. Quhar Wallace come thar deide was litill kend. The Sothroune part so frusched was that tide That in the stour thai mycht no langar bide. Wallace in deide he wrocht so worthely, The squier Boid and all thar chewalry. Litill, Kneland, gert off thar ennymys de. The Inglismen tuk playnly part to fle. On hors sum-part to strenthis can thame found To socour thaim, with mony werkand wound. A hundreth dede in feild was lewyt thar, And iii ?emen that Wallace menyde fer mar; Twa was off Kyle, and ane of Conyngayme With Robert Boide, to Wallace com fra hayme. Four scor fled that chapyt on the south syde. The Scottis in place that bauldly couth abyde Spoil?eid the feld, gat gold and othir ger, Harnes and hors quhilk thai mysteryt in wer. The Inglis knawis thai gart thar caryage leid To Clidis forest quhen thai war out off dreid. Thai band thaim fast with wedeis sad and sar, On bowand treis hangyt thaim rycht thar. He sparyt nane that abill was to wer, Bot wemen and preystis he gart thaim ay forber. Quhen this was doyne to thar dyner thai went Off stuff and wyne that god had to thaim sent. X scor thai wan of hors that cariage bure, With flour and wyne als mekill as thai mycht fur And othir stuff that thai off Carleile led. The Sothron part, out off the field at fled, With sorow socht to the castell off Ayr Befor the lord and tauld him off thar cair: Quhat gud thai lost and quha in field was slayne Throw wicht Wallace that was mekill off mayne, And how he had gart all thar serwandis hang. The Persye said, “And that squier lest lang He sall ws exile out off this contre cleyne. Sa dispitfull in wer was neuir seyne. In our presoune her last quhen that he was Our slouthfully our keparis lett him pas. Thus stuff our-land I fynde may nocht weill be; We mon ger bryng our wictaill be the se. Bot los our men, it helpis ws rycht nocht. Thar kyne may ban that euir we hyddir socht.” Lat I thaim thus blamand thar sory chance, And mar to sper of Scottis mennys gouernance. Quhen Wallace had weyle wenquist into playne The fals terand that had his fadyr slayne, His brothyr als quhilk was a gentill knycht, Othir gud men befor to dede thai dycht, He gert dewys and prowide thar wictaille, Baith stuff and hors that was of gret awaille. To freyndis about richt preuayle thai send; The ramanand full glaidlye thar thai spend. In Clydis wode thai soiornyt xx?? dayis. Na Sothren was persawyt in thai wais Bott he tholyt dede that come in thar danger. The worde of him walkit baith fer and ner. Wallace was knawin on lyff, leyffand in playne, Thocht Inglismen tharoff had mekill payn. The Erle Persye to Glaskow couth he fair With wys lordis and held a consell thair. Quhen thai war mett, weylle ma na x thousand, Na chyftane was that tyme durst tak on hand To leide the Range on Wallace to assaill. He speryt about quhat was the best consaill. Schir Amar Wallange, a fals traytour strange In Bothwell duelt and that was thaim amange, He said, “My lorde, my consaill will I giff. Bot ?e do it fra scaith ?e may nocht scheyff. ?he mon tak pes with-out mar tarying, As for a tyme we may send to the king.” The Persye said, “Of our trewis he will nane. Ane awfull chyftane trewly he is ane. He will do mair in faith or that he blyne. Sothroun to sla he thinkis it na syne.” Schir Amar said, “Trewis it wordis tak Quhill eft for him prowisioune we may mak. I knaw he will do mekill for his kyne. Gentrys ande trewtht ay restis him within. His uncle may, schir Ranald, mak this band. Gyff he will nocht, Racunnys all his land On-to the tyme that he this werk haiff wrocht.” Schir Ranald was sone to that consell brocht. Thai chargyt him to mak Wallace at pes, Or he suld pas to Londone with-outyn les. Schir Ranald said, “Lordis, ?he knaw this weill, At my commande he will nocht do adeill. His worthi kyn dispitously ?e slew, In presone syne ner to the dede him threw. He is at large and will nocht do for me, Thocht ?e tharfor rycht now suld ger me de.” Schir Amar said, “Thir lordis sone sall send On to the king and mak a finall end. Off his conquest forsuth he will it haiff. Wallace na thou ma nocht this kynrik saiff. Mycht Eduuard king get him for gold or land To be his man, than suld he bruk Scotland.” The lorde bade ces: “Thow excedis to that knycht, Fer mayr be treuth than it is ony rycht. The wrang conquest our king desiris ay On hym or us it sall be seyne some day. Wallace has rycht, bathe force and fair fortoun. ?e hard how he eschapyt our presoune.” Thus said that lord, syne prayit schir Ranald fair To mak this pes: “Thou schirreff ar of Ayr. As for a tyme we may awisit be, Undyr my seylle I sall be bound to the For Inglismen that thai sall do him nocht, Nor to no Scottis, les it be on thaim socht.” Schir Ranald wist he mycht thaim nocht ganestand. Off lord Persye he has Resauit this band. Perseys war trew and ay off full gret waill, Sobyr in pes and cruell in Battaill. Schir Ranald bownyde upon the morn but baid Wallace to seke in Clydis forest braid. So he him fand bownand to his dyner. Quhen thai had seyne this gud knycht was so ner Weyle he him knew and tauld thaim quhat he was. Meruaille he had quhat gart him hiddyr pas, Maide him gud cheyr of meyttis fresche and fyne. King Eduuardis self coud nocht get bettyr wyn Than thai had thar, warnage and wenysoun, Off bestiall in-to full gret fusioun. Syn eftir mett he schew thaim of his deide, How he had beyne in-to so mekill dreid. “Newo,” he said, “wyrk part of my consaill. Tak pes a quhill as for the mair awaill. Bot thou do so forsuth thou dois gret syne, For thai ar set till wndo all thi kyn.” Than Wallace said till gud men him about, “I will no pes for all this felloune dout Bot gif it ples bettir to ?ow than me.” The squier Boide him ansuerd sobyrle, “I gif consell, or this gud knycht be slayne, Tak pes a quhill, suppos it do ws payne.” So said Adam the ayr of Rycardtoune, And Kneland als grantyt to thar opynyoun. With thair consent Wallace this pes has tayn, As his Eyme wrocht, till x moneth war gayn. Thar leyff thai tuk with comforde in-to playn, Sanct Ihone to borch thai suld meyt haille agayn. Boyde and Kneland past to thar placis hayme, Adam Wallace to Ricardtoun be nayme, And Wil?ham furth till schir Ranald can ride And his houshald, in Corsby for to bide. This pees was cryede in August moneth myld. ?het goddis of battaill, furius and wild, Mars and Iuno, ay dois thar besynes, Causer of wer, wyrkar of wykitnes, And Venus als the goddes of luff Wytht ald Saturn his coursis till appruff. Thir iiii scansyte of diuers complexioun, Bataill, debaite, Inwy and destruccioun. I can nocht deyme for thar malancoly, Bot Wallace weille coude nocht in Corsby ly. Hym had leuir in trauaill for to be. Rycht sar he langyt the toune of Ayr to se. Schir Ranald past fra hame apon a day. Fyfteyne he tuk and to the toune went thai, Couerit his face that no man mycht him knaw. No-thing him roucht how few ennymyis him saw; In souir weide disgysit weill war thai. Ane Inglisman on the gait saw he play At the scrymmage, a bukler on his hand. Wallace ner by in falouschipe couth stand. Lychtly he sperde, “Quhi, Scot, dar thow nocht preiff?” Wallace said, “?a, sa thow wald gif me leiff.” “Smyt on,” he said. “I defy thine accioune.” Wallace thar-with has tane him on the croune. Throuch bukler, hand and the harnpan also, To the schuldyris the scharp suerd gert he go; Lychtly raturnd till his awne men agayne. The wemen cryede, “Our bukler player is slane!” The man was dede, quhat nedis wordis mair? Feille men of armys about him semblit thair, Sewyn scor atanys agayne xvi war sett. Bot Wallace sone weille with the formest mett, With Ire and will on the hede has him tayne, Throuch the brycht helm in sondir bryst the bane. Ane othir braithly in the breyst he bar; His burnyst blaid throuch-out the body schar. Gret rowme he maid; his men war fechtand fast And mony a growme thai maid full sair agast; For thai war wicht and weill wsyt in wer Off Inglismen rycht bauldly doun thai ber. On thar Enemys gret martirdome thai mak, Thar hardy chiftane so weill couth wndyrtak. Quhat Inglisman that baid in-till his gait Contrar Scotland maid neuir mar debait. Felle frekis on fold war fellyt wndyr feit; Off Sothroune blude lay stekit in the streit. New pouer come fra the castell that tyde. Than Wallace drede and drew towart a side; With gude will he wald escheu a suppris, For he in wer was besy, wicht and wis. Harnes and hedis he hew in sonderys fast. Beforce out off the thikest preys thai past. Wallace raturnyde behynde his men agayne. At the reskew feile Enemys has he slayne. His men all samyn he out off perill brocht Fra his Enymys for all the pouer thai mocht. To thar horsis thai wan but mair abaide. For danger syne to Laglyne wode thai raid. xx?? and ix thai left in-to that steide Off Sothroun men that bertynit war to dede. The Ramaynand agayne turnyt that tide, For in the woode thai durst nocht him abyde. Towart the toune thai drew with all thar mayn, Cursand the pes thai tuk befor in playne. The lord Persye in hart was gretlye grewyt. His men supprisyt agayne to him relewyt, And feille war dede in-to thar armour cler, Thre of his kyne that war till him full deir. Quhen he hard tell of thar gret grewance, Thar selff was caus of this myschefull chance, Murnyng he maid, thoucht few Scottis it kend. A herald than to schir Ranald he send And tald till him of all that sodeyne cas, And chargyt him tak souirte of Wallas: He suld him kepe fra merket, toune, or fair, Quhar he mycht best be out of thar repair. The Sothroun wist that it was wicht Wallace Had thaim ourset in-to that sodand cas. Thair trewis for this thai wald nocht brek adeill. Quhen Wallace had this chance eschewit weill, Vpon the nycht fra Lagleyne hayme he raid. In chaumeris sone thair residence thai maid. Vpon the morn quhen that the day was lycht Witht Wallace furth went schir Ranald the knycht, Schew him the wryt lord Persie had him sent. “Deir sone,” he said, “this war my haile entent, That thow wald grant, quhill thir trewis war worn, Na scaith to do till Inglisman that is born, Bot quhar I pas dayly thou bid with me.” Wallace ansuerd, “Gud schir, that may nocht be. Rycht laith I war, deyr wncle, ?ou to greiff. I sall do nocht till tyme I tak my leyff, And warn ?ou als or that I fra ?ou pas.” His eyme and he thar weill accordyt was. Wallace with him maid his continuance. Ilk wicht was blyth to do till him plesance. In Corsby thus he resyd thaim amang Thai xvi dayis, suppos him thocht it lang. Thocht thai mycht ples him as a prince or king In his mynde ?it remanyt ane othir thing: He saw his Enemys maisteris in this regioune; Mycht nocht him ples thocht he war king with croune. Thus leyff I him with his der freyndis still. Off Inglismen of sum-part spek I will. BOOK IV In September, the humyll moneth suette, Quhen passyt by the hycht was off the hette, Wictaill and froyte ar rypyt in aboundance As god ordans to mannys gouernance. Sagittarius with his aspre bow, Be the Ilk syng weryte ?e may know The changing cours quhilk makis gret deference. And lewys had lost thair colouris of plesence. All warldly thing has nocht bot a sesoune, Both erbe and froyte mon fra the hycht cum doun. In this Ilk tyme a gret consell was sett In-to Glaskow, quhar mony maisteris mett Off Inglis lordis to statute this cuntre. Than chargyt thai all schirreffis thar to be. Schir Ranald Crawfurd behowide that tyme be thar For he throw rycht was born schirreff of Ayr. His der neuo that tyme with hym he tuk, Will?ham Wallace, as witnes beris the buk, For he na tyme suld far be fra his sicht. He luffyt him with hart and all his mycht. Thai graith thaim weill with-out langar abaid. Wallace sum-part befor the court furth raid, With him twa men that douchtye war in deid, Our-tuk the child schir Ranaldis sowme couth leid. Softlye thai raid quhill thai the court suld knaw. So sodeynly at Hesilden he saw The Perseys sowme, in quhilk gret ryches was. The hors was tyryt and mycht no forthir pas. V men was chargit to keipe it weill all sid, Twa was on fute, and thre on hors couth ride. The maistir man at thar serwand can sper, “Quha aw this sowme? The suth ?ou to me ler.” The man ansuerd withoutyn wordis mar, “My lordis,” he said, “quhilk schirreff is of Ayr.” “Sen it is his this hors sall with ws gang To serwe our lord, or ellis me think gret wrang. Thocht a subiet in deid wald pas his lord, It is nocht lewyt be na rychtwis racord.” Thai cutt the brays and leyt the harnes faw. Wallace was ner quhen he sic reuere saw. He spak to thaim with manly contenance; In fayr afforme he said but wariance, “?e do us wrang, and it in tyme of pes. Off sic rubry war suffisance to ces.” The Sothron schrew In Ire ansuerd him to, “It sall be wrocht as thow may se ws do. Thow gettis no mendis.” Quhat wald thou wordis mar? Sadly awisit, Wallace Remembrith him thar On the promys he maid his Eyme befor. Resoun him rewllyt, as than he did no mor. The hors thai tuk for awentur mycht befall, Laid on thar sowme, syne furth the way couth call. Thar tyryt sowmir so left thai in-to playne. Wallace raturnd towart the court agayne. On the mur syde sone with his eyme he mett And tauld how thai the way for his man sett: “And war noucht I was bonde in my legiance, We partyt noucht thus for all the gold in France. The hors thai reft quhilk suld ?our harnes ber.” Schir Ranald said, “That is bot litill der. We may get hors and othir gud in playne. And men be lost we get thaim neuir agayne.” Wallace than said, “Als wisly god me sawe, Off this gret mys I sall amendis hawe And nothir latt for pes na ?our plesance. With witnes her I gif up my legiance, For cowardly ?e lik to tyne ?our rycht. ?our selff sone syne to dede thai think to dycht.” In wraith thar-with away fra him he went. Schyr Ranald was wis and kest in his entent, And said, “I will byde at the Mernys all nycht; So Inglismen may deyme ws no Wnrycht Gyff ony be deide befor ws upon cas, That we in law may bide the rychtwisnas.” His luging tuk, still at the Mernys baid. Full gret murnyng he for his neuo maid, Bot all for nocht, quhat mycht it him awaill? As in-till wer he wrocht nocht his consaill. Wallace raid furth; with him twa ?emen past. The sowmir man he folowid wondyr fast. Be est Cathcart he our-hyede thaim agayne. Than knew thai weille that it was he in playne, Be hors and weide, that argownd thaim befor. The fyve to thaim retornde with-outyn mor. Wallace to ground fra his courser can glide. A burnyst brand he bradyt out that tyde. The maistir man with sa gud will straik he Bathe hatt and hede he gert in sondyr fle. Ane othir fast apon the face he gaiff; Till dede to ground but mercy he him draiff. The thrid he hyt with gret Ire in that steid; Fey on the feld he has him left for deid. Wallace slew iii. Be that his ?emen wicht The tothir twa derfly to dede thai dycht. Syne spoil?eid thai the harnais or thai wend Off siluir and gold aboundandlye to spend. Iowellis thai tuk, the best was chosyn thar, Gud hors and geyr, syne on thar wayis can fayr. Than Wallace said, “At sum strenth wald I be.” Our Glid that tyme thar was a bryg of tre; Thiddir thai past in all thar gudlye mycht. The day was gayne and cummyn was the nycht. Thai durst nocht weylle ner Glaskow still abide. In the Lennox he tuk purpos to ryde, And so he dyde, syne lugyt thaim that nycht As thai best mowcht, quhill that the day was brycht. Till ane ostrye he went and soiorned thar With trew Scottis quhilk at his freindis war. The consaill mett rycht glaidly on the morn Bot fell tithingis was brocht Persie beforn: His men war slayne, his tresour als bereft With fell Scottis and thaim na jowellis left. Thai demede about off that derff, doutous cas. The Sothren said, “Forsuth it is Wallas; The schirreffis court was cumand to the toun, And he as ane for Scot of most renoun.” Thai gert go seik schir Ranald in that rage, Bot he was than ?eit still at herbryage. Sum wis men said, “Heroff na thing he kend. The men war slayne rycht at the townis end.” Schir Ranald come by x houris of the day. Befor Persye than seir men brocht war thai. Thai folowit him of felouny that was wrocht. The siys of this couth say to him rycht nocht. Thai demede about of that fell sodeyne cas. Befor the iuge thar he denyit Wallas, And so he mycht, he wist nocht quhar he was. Fra this consaill my purpos is to pas, Off Wallace spek in wyldirnes so wyde. The eterne god his gouernour be and gyde. Styll at the place iiii days he soiorned haill Quhill tithingis come till him fra thar consaill. Than statute thai in ilk steide of the west In thar boundis Wallace suld haiff no rest. His der wncle gret ayth thai gert him suer That he but leiff suld no freindschipe him ber. And mony othir was full woo that day. Robert the Boide stall of the toune his way, And Kneland als, befor with him had beyne. Thai had leuir haif seyne him with thar Eyne Leyffand in lyff, as thai knew him befor, Than of cler gold a fyne myl?one and mor. Boid wepyt sor, said, “Our leidar is gayne. Amang our fays he is set him allayne.” Than Kneland said, “Fals fortoun changis fast. Gret god, sen we had euir with him past!” Eduuard Litill in Annadyrdaill is went And wait rycht nocht of this newe iugëment. Adam Wallace baid still in Ricardtoun. So fell it thus with Wallace of renoun, He with power partyt merwalusly. Be fortoun chance ourturnys doubilly. Thar petuous mene as than couth nocht be bett. Thai wyst no wyt quhar that thai suld him get. He left the place quhilk he in lugyng lay. Till Erle Malcome he went upon a day. The Lennox haile he had still in his hand. Till king Eduuard he had nocht than maid band. That land is strait and maisterfull to wyn. Gud men of armys that tyme was It within. The lord was traist, the men sekyr and trew. With waik power thai Durst him nocht persew. Rycht glaid he was of Wallace cumpany, Welcummyt him fayr with worschipe reuerandlye; At this awne will desyryt gyff he walde To byde thair still maistyr of his houshald, Off all his men he suld haile chyftayne be. Wallace ansuerd, “That war yneuch for me. I can nocht byde, my mynde is sett in playne Wrokyn to be or ellis de in the payne. Our wast contre thar statute is so strang In-to the north my purpos is to gang.” Stewyn of Irland, than in the Lennox was, With wicht Wallace he ordynyt him to pas, And othir als that borne war off Argill. Wallace still thair residence maid a quhill Quhill men it wist and semblit sone him till. He chargyt nayne bot at thar awne gud will. For thai war strang, ?eitt he couth nocht thaim dreid Bot resawit all in weris thaim to leid. Sum-part off tham was in-to Irland borne, That Makfad?an had exilde furth beforne. King Eduuardis man he was, suorn of Ingland, Off rycht law byrth suppos he tuk on hand. To Wallace thar come ane that hecht Fawdoun. Malancoly he was of complexioun, Hewy of statur, dour in his contenance, Soroufull, sadde, ay dreidfull, but plesance. Wallace resawit quhat man wald cum him till. The bodelye ayth thai maid him with gud will Befor the erle, all with a gud accord, And him resawyt as captane and thar lord. His speciall men that come with him fra hame, The tayne hecht Gray, the tothir Kerle be name, In his seruice come fyrst with all thar mayne To Lowdoun hill, quhar that Fenweik was slayne, He thaim comandyt ay next him to persew, For he thaim kend rycht hardye, wis and trew. His leyff he tuk rycht on a fair maner. The gud erlle than, he bad him gyftis ser. Wallace wald nayne bot gaiff of his fell sys To pour and rych vpon a gudlye wis. Humyll he was, hardy, wis and fre; As off Ryches he held na propyrte. Off honour, worschipe, he was a merour kend. Als he off gold had boundandlye to spend, Wpon his fayis he wan it worthely. Thus Wallace past and his gud chewalry. Sexty he had off lykly men at wage. Throuch the Lennox he led thaim with curage. A-bown Lekke he lugyt thaim in a waille. A strenth thar was quhilk thai thocht till assaill. On Gargownno was byggyt a small peill That warnyst was with men and wictaill weill, Within a dyk bathe clos, chawmir and hall. Capteyne tharoff to nayme he hecht Thrilwall. Thai led Wallace quhar that this byggynge was. He thocht to assaill it ferby or he wald pas. Twa spyis he send to wesy all that land. Rycht laith he was the thing to tak on hand The quhilk beforce that suld gang hym agayne. Leuir had he throw awentur be slayne. Thir men went furth as it was large mydnycht; About that hous thai spyit all at rycht. The wachman was hewy fallen on sleipe. The bryg, was doun at that entre suld keipe, The lauboreris latt rakleslye went In. Thir men retornede with-outyn noyes or dyn To thar maistir, told him as thai had seyne. Than grathit sone thir men of armys keyne. Sadlye on fute on to the hous thai socht And entryt In, for lattyn fand thai nocht. Wicht men assayede witht all thar besy cur A loklate bar was drawyn ourthourth the dur, Bot thai mycht nocht it brek out of the waw. Wallace was grewyt quhen he sic tary saw. Sumpart amowet wraithly till it he went; Be fors off handis he raist out of the stent, Thre ?erde off breide als off the wall puld out. Than merweld all his men that war about How he dide mair than xx?? off thaim mycht. Syne with his fute the ?ett he straik wp rycht Quhill brais and band to-byrstyt all at-anys. Ferdely thai rais that war in-to thai wanys. The wachman, had a felloune staff of steill, At Wallace strake, bot he kepyt hym weill. Rudely fra him he reft it in that thrang, Dang out his harnys, syne in the dik him flang. The remaynand be that was on thar feit. Thus Wallace sone can with the capteyn meite. The staff he had, hewy and forgyt new, With it Wallace wpon the hede him threw, Quhill bayn and brayn all in-to sondir ?eid. His men entryt that worthy war in deid, In handis hynt and stekit of the layff. Wallace commaundede thai suld na wermen saiff. Twenty and twa thai stekit in that steid. Wemen and barnys, quhen at the men war deide, He gert be tayn, in clos hous kepyt weill, So thai wytht-out thar-off mycht haiff no feill. The dede bodyes thai put sone out of sycht, Tuk wp the bryg or that the day was lycht, In that place baid iiii dayis or he wald pas. Wist nane with-out how at this mater was. Spoil?eide that steid and tuk thaim ganand ger. Iowellis and gold away with thaim thai ber. Quhen him thocht tyme thai ischede on the nycht. To the next woode thai went with all thar mycht; The captenys wiff, wemen and childir thre Pas quhar thai wald, for Wallas leit thaim be. In that forest he likit nocht to bide. Thai bownyt thaim atour Forth for to ride. The mos was strang, to ryde thaim was no but, Wallas was wicht and lychtyt on his fute. Few hors thai had, litill thar-off thai roucht. To sawe lywes feill strenthis oft thai socht. Stewyn of Irland he was thar gyd that nycht Towart Kyncardyn; syne restit thar at rycht In a forest that was bathe lang and wide, Rycht fra the mos grew to the wattir syde. Eftir the sone Wallas walkit about Vpon Tetht side, quhar he saw mony rout Off wyld bestis wauerand in wode and playn. Sone at a schot a gret hart has he slayn, Slew fyr on flynt and graithit thaim at rycht. Sodeynly thar fresche venesoun thai dycht. Wictaill thai had, bathe breid and wyn so cler, With othir stuff yneuch at thar dyner. His staff of steill he gaiff Kerly to kepe. Syn passit thai our Tetht wattir so depe. In-to Straithern thai entrit sodeynly, In couert past or Sothren suld thaim spy. Quhen at thai fand of Scotlandis aduersouris With-out respyt cummyn was thar fatell houris. Quham euir thai mett was at the Inglis fay Thai slew all doun with-out langar delay. Thai sparyt nane that was off Inglis blude; To dede he ?eid thocht he war neuir so gude. Thai sawyt nothir knycht, squier nor knaiff; This was the grace that Wallace to thaim gaiff, But wastyt all be worthynes off wer Off that party that mycht weild bow or sper. Sumpart be slycht, sumpart throw force thai slew, Bot Wallace thocht thai stroyit nocht half enew. Siluir thai tuk and als gold at thai fand. Othir gud ger full lychtly ?eid be hand. Cuttyt throttis and in-to cuwys thaim kest, Put out of sycht for that him thocht was best. At the Blakfurd as at thai suld pas our, A squier come and with him bernys four Till Doun suld ryde, and wend at thai had beyne All Inglismen at he befor had seyne. Tithingis to sper he howid thaim amang. Wallace thar-with swyth with a suerd out swang. Vpon the hede he straik with so gret Ire, Throu bayne and brayn in sondir schar the swyr. The tothir four in handis sone war hynt, Derfly to dede stekit or thai wald stynt. Thar hors thai tuk and quhat thaim likit best, Spoil?eid thaim bar, syne in the brook thaim kest. Off this mater no mor tary thai maid Bot furth thar way passit with-outyn baid. Thir werlik Scottis all with one assent Northt so our Ern throuch-out the land thai went, In Meffan woode thar lugyng tuk that nycht. Vpon the morn quhen it was dayis lycht Wallace rais wp, went to the forest side, Quhar that he sawe full feill bestis abide, Off wylde and tayme walkand haboundandlye. Than Wallace said, “This contre likis me. Wermen may do with fud at thai suld haiff, Bot want thai meit thai rak nocht of the laiff.” Off dyet fayr Wallace tuk neuir kepe Bot as it come welcum was meit and sleip. Sum-quhill he had gret sufficience within; Now want, now has, now los, now can wyn; Now lycht, now sadd; now blisful, now in baill; In haist, now hurt; now sorouffull, now haill; Nowe weildand weyle, now calde weddyr, now heit; Nowe moist, now drowth, now wauerand wynd, now weit. So ferd with him for Scotlandis rycht full ewyn In feyle debait vi ?eris and monethis sewyn. Quhen he wan pees and left Scotland in playne The Inglismen maid new conquest agayne. In frustyr termys I will nocht tary lang. Wallace agayne wnto his men can gang And said, “Her is a land of gret boundance, Thankit be god of his hye purwyans! Sewyn of ?ow feris graith sone and ga with me. Rycht sor I long Sanct Ihonstoun for to se. Stewyn of Irland, als god of hewyn the saiff, Maister leiddar I mak the of the laiff. Kepe weill my men, latt nane out of thi sycht Quhill I agayn sall cum with all my mycht. Byde me sewyn dayis in this forest strang. ?he may get fude, suppos I duell so lang. Sumpart ?he haif and god will send ws mair.” Thus turnyt he and to the toun couth fair. The mar kepyt the port of that willage; Wallace knew weill and send him his message. The mar was brocht, saw him a gudlye man, Rycht reuerandlye he has resawyt thaim than. At him he speryt all Scottis gyff thai be. Wallace said, “?a, and it is pees, trow we.” “I grant,” he said, “that likis ws wondyr weill. Trew men of pees may ay sum frendschipe feill. Quhat is ?our nayme? I pray ?ow tell me it.” “Will Malcomsone,” he said, “sen ?e wald witt. In Atryk forest has my wonnyng beyne. Thar I was born amang the schawis scheyne. Now I desyr this north land for to se, Quhar I mycht find better duellyng for me.” The mar said, “Schir, I sper nocht for nane Ille, Bot feill tithingis oft-syis is brocht ws till Off ane Wallace, was born in-to the west. Our kingis men he haldis at gret wnrest, Martyris thaim doun, gret pete is to se. Out of the trewis forsuth we trow he be.” Wallace than said, “I her spek of that man. Tithingis off him to ?ou nane tell I can.” For him he gert ane Innys graithit be Quhar nane suld cum bot his awne men and he. Hys stwart Kerlye brocht thaim in fusioun Gude thing eneuch quhat was in-to the toun; Als Inglismen to drynkyn wald him call And commownly he delt nocht thar-withall. In thar presence he spendyt resonably, ?heit for him self he payit ay boundandlye. On Scottismen he spendyt mekill gud Bot nocht his thankis wpon the Sothren blud. Son he consawyt in his witt prewalye In-to that land quha was of maist party. Schir Iamys Butler, ane agit cruell knycht, Kepyt Kynclewyn, a castell wondyr wycht. His sone schir Ihon than duelt in-to the toun, Vndyr Capteyn to schir Garraid Heroun. The wemen als he wysyt at the last, And so on ane hys eyne he can to cast, In the south gait, of fassoun fresche and fayr. Wallace to hir maid preualye repair. So fell it thus, of the toun or he past At ane accorde thai hapnyt at the last. Wallace with hyr in secre maid him glaid; Sotheren wist nocht that he sic plesance haid. Offt in the nycht he wald say to him sell, “This is fer war than ony payn of hell, At thus with wrang thir dewillis suld bruk our land And we with force may nocht agayne thaim stand. To tak this toun my pouer is to small. Gret perell als apon my self may fall. Set we it in fyr it will wndo my sell Or los my men, thar is no mor to tell. ?hettis ar clos, the dykis depe with-all. Thocht I wald swyme forsuth so can nocht all. This mater now her-for I will ourslyde, Bot in this toun I may no langar byde.” Als men tald him quhen the captayne wald pas Hayme to Kynclewyn, quhar-off rycht glaid he was. His leiff he tuk at heris of the toun, To Meffane wode rycht glaidly maid him boun. His horn he hynt and bauldly loud can blaw. His men him hard and tharto sone couth draw. Rycht blyth he was for thai war all in feyr. Mony tithingis at him thai wald nocht speyr. He thaim commaunde to mak thaim redy fast. In gud array out of the woode thai past. Towart Kynclewyn thai bownyt thaim that tid, Syn in a waill that ner was thar besid, Fast on to Tay, his buschement can he draw. In a dern woode thai stellit thaim full law, Set skouriouris furth the contre to aspye. Be ane our nowne thre for-rydaris went bye. The wach turned in to witt quhat was his will. He thaim commaund in couert to bide still: “And we call feyr the hous knawlage will haiff And that may sone be warnying to the laiff. Off fors in wer do nocht but gouernance.” Wallace was few bot happy ordinance Maid him fell syis his aduersouris to wyn. Be that the court of Inglismen com In, Four scoyr and x weill graithit in thar ger, Harnest on hors, all likly men of wer. Wallace saw weill thar nowmir was na ma; He thankit god and syne the field couth ta. The Inglismen merweild quhat thai suld be, Bot fra thai saw thai maid thaim for melle. In fewtir thai kest scharpe speris at that tide. In Ire thai thoucht atour the Scottis to ryd. Wallace and his went cruelly thaim agayne. At the fyrst rusche feill Inglismen war slayne. Wallace straik ane with his gude sper of steill Throw-out the cost; the schafft to-brak Ilk deyll. A burnyst brand in haist he hyntis out. Thrys apon fute he thrang throuch all the rout. Stern hors thai steik suld men of armys ber. Sone wndir feit ful?eid was men of wer. Butler lychtyt him self for to defend Witht men of armys quhilk war full worthi kend. On athyr syde feill frekis war fechtand fast. The captayne baid thocht he war sor agast. Part of the Scottis be worthines thai slew; Wallace was wa and towart him he drew. His men dred for the Butler bauld and keyn. On him he socht In Ire and propyr teyn, Vpon the hed him straik in matelent. The burnyst blaid throu-out his basnett went. Bathe bayne and brayn he byrst throw all the weid. Thus Wallace hand deliuerit thaim off dreid. ?eitt feill on fold was fechtand cruelly; Stewyn of Irland and all the cheualry In-to the stour did cruelly and weill, And Kerle als with his gud staff of steill. The Inglismen, fra thar cheftayne was slayne, Thai left the feild and fled in all thar mayn. Thre scoyr war slayne or thai wald leif that steid. The fleande folk that wist of no rameid Bot to the hous, thai fled in all thar mycht. The Scottis folowit, that worthi war and wycht. Few men of fens was left that place to kepe. Wemen and preistis wpon wallis can wepe, For weill thai wend the flearis was thar lord. To tak him in thai maid thaim redy ford, Leit doun the bryg, kest wp the ?ettis wide. The frayit folk entrit and durst nocht byde; Gud Wallace euir he folowit thaim so fast Quhill in the hous he entryt at the last. The ?ett he wor quhill cumin was all the rout. Of Inglis and Scottis he held no man thar-out. The Inglismen that won war in that steid With-outyn grace thai bertnyt thaim to deid. The capteynis wiff, wemen and preistis twa And ?ong childir, forsuth thai sawyt no ma; Held thaim in clos eftir this sodeyn cas Or Sothron men suld sege him in that place; Tuk wp the bryg and closyt ?ettis fast. The dede bodyes out of sicht he gart cast, Baith in the hous and with-out at war dede. V of hys awne to berynis he gart leid. In that castell thar vii dayis baide he. On Ilka nycht thai spoil?eid besyle, To Schortwode schaw leide wictaill and wyn wicht, Houshald and ger, baithe gold and siluir brycht. Wemen and thai that he had grantyt grace Quhen him thoucht tyme thai put out of that place; Quhen thai had tayne quhat he likit to haiff, Straik doun the ?ettis and set in fyr the laiff. Out of wyndowis stanssouris all thai drew, Full gret Irn wark in-to the wattir threw. Burdyn duris and lokis in thair Ire, All werk of tre, thai brynt wp in a fyr, Spylt at thai mycht, brak brig and bulwark doun. To Schortwode schawe in haist thai maid thaim boun, Chesyt a strenth quhar thai thar lugyng maid. In gud affer a quhill thar still he baid. ?it it in the toun no wit of this had thai. The contre folk quhen it was lycht of day Gret reik saw rys and to Kynclewyn thai socht. Bot wallis and stane mar gud thar fand thai nocht. The Captennis wiff to Sanct Ihonstoun scho ?eid And to schir Garrate tald this felloune deid, Als till hyr son quhat hapnyt was be cas. Than demyt thai all that it was wicht Wallas, Off for-tyme thar he spyit had the toun. Than chargyt thai all thai suld be redy boun, Harnest on hors in-to thair armour cler. To seik Wallace thai went all furth in feyr, A thousand men weill garnest for the wer, Towart the woode rycht awfull in affer, To Schortwode schaw, and set it all about Wytht v staillis that stalwart was and stout. The sext thai maid a fellon range to leid Quhar Wallace was, full worthi ay in deid. The strenth he tuk and bade thaim hald it still On ilka syde, assail?e quha sa will. Schir Ihon Butler in-to the forrest went With ii hundreth, sor mowit in his entent; His fadris dede to wenge him gif he mocht To Wallace sone with men of armys socht. A cleuch thar was, quharoff a strenth thai maid With thuortour treis, bauldly thar abaid. Fra the ta side thai mycht ische till a playne, Syn throuch the wode to the strenth pas agayn. Twenty he had that nobill archaris war Agayne sewyn scoyr of Inglis bowmen sar. Four scoyr of speris ner-hand thaim baid at rycht, Giff Scottis Ischit to help thaim at thair mycht, On Wallace sett a bykkyr bauld and keyn. A bow he bair was byg and weyll beseyn And arrous als bath lang and scharpe with-all. No man was thar that Wallace bow mycht drall. Rycht stark he was and in-to souir ger. Bauldly he schott amang thai men of wer. Ane angell hede to the hukis he drew And at a schoyt the formast sone he slew. Ynglis archaris that hardy war and wicht Amang the Scottis bykkerit with all thar mycht. That awfull schoyt was felloun for to byd. Off Wallace men thai woundyt sor that tid. Few off thaim was sekyr of archary; Bettyr thai war and thai gat ewyn party In feild to byde othir with suerd or speyr. Wallace persauit his men tuk mekill deyr. He gart thaim change and stand nocht in-to steid. He kest all wayis to saiff thaim fra the dede. Full gret trauaill vpon him self tuk he. Off Sothron men feill archaris he gert de. Off Longcaschyr bowmen was in that place; A sar archar ay waytit on Wallace At ane opyn quhar he vsyt to repair. At him he drew a sekir schot and sar Undyr the chyn throuch a coler of steill On the left syde and hurt his hals sumdeill. Astonaide he was bot nocht gretlye agast. Out fra his men on him he folowit fast, In the turnyng with gud will has him tayne Vpon the crag, in sondyr straik the bayne. Feill of thaim ma na freyndschip with him fand. Fyfteyn that day he schot to dede of his hand. Be that his arrous waistyt war and gayne The Inglis archaris forsuth thai wantyt nayne. With-out thai war thar power to ranew; On Ilka side to thaim thai couth persew. Wyl?ham Loran com with a boustous staill Out of Gowry on Wallace to assaill. Neuo he was, as it was knawin in playn, To the Butler befor that thai had slayn. To wenge his eyme he come with all his mycht. Thre hundreth he led of men in armys brycht. To leide the range on fute he maid him ford. Wallace to god his conscience fyrst remord, Syne comfort thaim with manly contenance. “Yhe se,” he said, “gud schiris, thar ordinance: Her is no chos bot owdir do or de. We haiff the rycht, the happyar may it be That we sall chaipe with grace out of this land.” The Loran be that was redy at his hand. Be that it was eftir nown of the day Feill men of witt to consaill sone ?eid thai. The Sothron kest scharply at Ilka side And saw the wood was nothir lang no wide. Lychtly thai thocht he suld hald it so lang. Fywe hundreth maid throu it on fute to gang, Sad men off armes that war off eggyr will. Schir Garratis self with-out the woode baid still. Schir Ihon Butler the ta sid chesyt he, The tothir Loran with a fell men?he. Than gud Wallace that of help had gret neid Was fyfty men in all that felloun dreid. Ane awfull salt the Sothren son began. About the Scottis socht mony likly man With bow and sper and swerdis stiff of steill. On athir side no frendschip was to feill. Wallace in Ire a burly brand can draw Quhar feill Sothren war semblit vpon raw, To fende his men with his deyr-worthi hand. The folk was fey that he befor him fand. Throw the thikkest of the gret preis he past, Vpon his Enemys hewand wondyr fast. Agayne his dynt na weidis mycht awaill, Quham-so he hyt was dede with-outyn faill. Off the fersest full braithly bair he doun Befor the Scottis, that war of gret renoun. To hald the strenth thai preist with all thar mycht. The Inglismen that worthi war and wicht Schir Ihon Butler relewit in agayne, Swndryt the Scottis and did thaim mekill payn, The Loran als that cruell was and keyn. A sar assay forsuth thar mycht be seyn. Than at the strenth thai mycht no langar bide, The range so strang com wpon athir side. In the thikkest woode thar maid thai felle defens Agayn thar fayis so full of wiolens; ?it feile Sothron left the lyff to wed. Till a new strenth Wallace and his men fled. On aduersouris thai maid full gret debait; Bot help thaim self no socour ellis thai wait. The Sothron als war sundryt than in twyn Bot thai agayne to-giddir sone can wyn. Full sutellye thar ordinance thai maid. The rang agayne bownyt but mar abaid. The Scottis war hurt and part of thaim war slayn. Than Wallace said, “We laubour all in vane. To slay commounis it helpis us richt nocht, Bot thair Chiftanis that hes thame hidder brocht, Micht we wirk swa that ane of thame war slane, So sair assay thay couth nocht mak agayn.” Be this the host approchand was full ner. Thus wrandly thai held thaim wpon ster. Quhen Wallace saw the Sothroune was at hand Him thocht no tym than langar for to stand. Rycht manfully he graithit has his ger, Sadly he went agayne thai men of wer; Throw-out the stour full fast fechtand he socht With goddis grace to wenge him gif he mocht. Vpon the Butler awfully straik he. Saiffgarde he gat wndir a bowand tre. The bowcht in twa he straik aboune his hede Als to the ground and feld him in that stede. The haill pouer wpon him com so fast At thai beforce reskewit him at the last. Loran was wa and thiddir fast can draw. Wallas ratornd sa sodeynly him saw. Out at a syde full fast till him he ?eid; He gat no gyrth for all his burnyst weid, With Ire him straik on his gorgeat off steill. The trensand blaid to-persyt euirydeill Throu plaitt and stuff, mycht nocht agayn it stand. Derffly to dede he left him on the land. Hym haif thai lost, thocht Sotheren had it suorn, For his crag bayne was all in sondyr schorn. The worthy Scottis did nobilly that day About Wallace till he was wonn away. He tuk the strenth magre thar fayis will, Abandonly in bargan baid thar still. The scry sone rais, the bauld Loran was dede. Schir Garrat Heroun tranontit to that stede And all the host assemblit him about. At the north side than Wallace Ischet owt, With him his men, and bownyt him to ga, Thankand gret god at thai war partyt sa. To Gargyll wood thai went that sammyn nycht. Sewyn of his men that day to dede was dycht; In feld was left of the Sothren sex scoyr, And Loran als, thar murnyng was the mor. The rang in haist thai rayit sone agayne, Bot quhen thai saw thar trauaill was in wayne And he was past, full mekill mayne thai maid To rype the wood, bath wala, slonk and slaid, For Butleris gold Wallace tuk off befor; Bot thai fand nocht, wald thai seke euirmor. Hys hors thai gat and nocht ellis of thar ger. With dulfull mayn retorned thir men of wer To Sanct Ihonnston, in sorou and gret cayr. Of Wallace furth me likis to spek mair. The secunde nycht the Scottis couth thaim draw Rycht prewaly agayne to Schortwod schaw, Tuk wp thar gud quhilk was put owt of sicht, Cleithing and stuff, bathe gold and siluir brycht; Vpon thar fute, for horsis was thaim fra, Or the son rais to Meffen wood can ga. Thai twa dayis our thar lugyng still thai maid. On the thrid nycht thai mowit but mar abaid, Till Elkok park full sodeynly thai went. Thar in that strentht to bide was his entent. Than Wallas said he wald go to the toun, Arayit him weill in-till a preistlik goun. In Sanct Ihonstoun disgysyt can he fair Till this woman the quhilk I spak of ayr. Off his presence scho rycht reiosit was And sor a-dred how he away suld pas. He soiornyt thair fra nowne was of the day Quhill ner the nycht or that he went away. He trystyt hyr quhen he wald cum agayne. On the thrid day than was scho wondyr fayne. ?eitt he was seyn with Enemys as he ?eid. To schir Garraid thai tald off all his deid, And to Butler that wald haiff wrokyn beyne. Than thai gart tak that woman brycht and scheyne, Accusyt hir sar of resset in that cas. Feyll syis scho suor that scho knew nocht Wallas. Than Butler said, “We wait weyle it was he, And bot thou tell in bayle-fyr sall thou de. Giff thou will help to bryng ?on rebell doun We sall the mak a lady off renoun.” Thai gaiff till hyr baith gold and siluir brycht And said scho suld be weddyt with ane knycht, Quham scho desirit, that was but mariage. Thus tempt thai hir throu consaill and gret wage, That scho thaim tald quhat tyme he wald be thar. Than war thai glaid, for thai desirit no mar Off all Scotland bot Wallace at thar will. Thus ordaynyt thai this poyntment to fullfill; Feyle men off armes thai graithit hastelye To kepe the ?ettis, wicht Wallas till aspye. At the set trist he entrit in the toun, Wittand no thing of all this fals tresoune. Till hir chawmer he went but mair abaid. Scho welcummyt him and full gret plesance maid. Quhat at thai wrocht I can nocht graithly say, Rycht wnperfyt I am of Venus play, Bot hastelye he graithit him to gang. Than scho him tuk and speryt giff he thocht lang. Scho askit him that nycht with hir to bid. Sone he said, “Nay, for chance that may betide. My men ar left all at mysrewill for me. I may nocht sleipe this nycht quhill I thaim se.” Than wepyt scho and said full oft, “Allace! That I was maide wa worthe the courssit cas! Now haiff I lost the best man leiffand is. O feble mynd to do so foul a mys! O waryit witt, wykkyt and wariance, That me has brocht in-to this myschefull chance! Allace,” scho said, “in warld that I was wrocht! Giff all this payne on my self mycht be brocht! I haiff seruit to be brynt in a gleid. Quhen Wallace saw scho ner of witt couth weid, In his armes he caucht hir sobrely And said, “Der hart, quha has mys-doyn ocht, I? “Nay, I,” quod scho, “has falslye wrocht this trayn. I haiff ?ou sald. Rycht now ?he will be slayn. Scho tauld till him hir tresoun till ane end As I haiff said, quhat nedis mair Legend? At hir he speryt giff scho forthocht it sar. “Wa, ?a!” scho said, “and sall do euirmar. My waryed werd in warld I mon fullfill. To mend this mys I wald byrne on a hill.” He comfort hir and baide hir haiff no dreide. “I will,” he said, “haiff sumpart off thi weid.” Hir goun he tuk on hym and courches als. “Will god I sall eschape this tresoune fals. I the forgyff with-outyn wordis mair.” He kissyt hir, syne tuk his leiff to fayr. Hys burly brand that helpyt him offt in neid Rycht prewalye he hid it wndyr that weid. To the south ?ett the gaynest way he drew, Quhar that he fand off armyt men enew. To thaim he tald, dissemblyt contenance, To the chawmer quhar he was vpon chance, “Speid fast,” he said, “Wallace is lokit In.” Fra him thai socht with-outyn noyis or dyn. To that sammyn hous about thai can thaim cast. Out at the ?ett than Wallas gat full fast, Rycht glaid in hart quhen that he was with-out. Rycht fast he ?eide, a stour pais and a stout. Twa him beheld and said, “We will go se. A stalwart queyne forsuth ?on semys to be.” Thai folowit him throwe the South Ynche thai twa. Quhen Wallace saw with thaim thar come na ma Agayne he turnede and has the formast slayn. The tothir fled. Than Wallas with gret mayn Vpon the hed with his suerd has him tayne; Left thaim bathe dede, syne to the strenth is gayne. His men he gat, rycht glaid quhen thai him saw. Till thair defence in haist he gart thaim draw, Deuoydyde him sone of the womannys weid. Thus chapyt he out of that felloun dreid. BOOK V The dyrk regioun apperand wondyr fast, In Nouember quhen October was past The day faillit, throu the rycht cours worthit schort. Till banyst men that is no gret comfort. With thar power, in pethis worthis gang, Hewy thai think quhen at the nycht is lang. Thus Wallas saw the nychtis messynger, Phebus, had lost his fyry bemys cler. Out of the wood thai durst nocht turn that tyd For aduersouris that in thair way wald byde. Wallace thaim tauld that new wer wes on hand, The Inglismen was off the toun cummande. The dure thai brak quhar thai trowyt Wallace was; Quhen thai him myst thai bownyt thaim to pas. In this gret noyis the woman gat away, Bot to quhat steide I can nocht graithlye say. The Sothroun socht rycht sadly fra that stede Throu the South Ynch and fand thir two men dede. Thai knew be that Wallace was in the strenth. About the park thai set on breid and lenth With vi hundreth weill graithit in thar armes, All likly men to wrek thaim of thar harmes; A hundreth men chargit in armes strang To kepe a hunde that thai had thaim amang. In Gyllis-land thar was that brachell brede, Sekyr off sent to folow thaim at flede. So was scho vsyt on Esk and on Ledaill; Quhill scho gat blude no fleyng mycht awaill. Than said thai all Wallace mycht nocht away, He suld be tharis for ocht at he do may. The ost thai delt in diuers part that tyde. Schir Garrat Herroun in the staill can abide. Schir Ihon Butler the range he tuk him till With thre hundyr quhilk war of hardy will; In-to the woode apon Wallace thai ?eid. The worthi Scottis, that wer in mekill dreid, Socht till a place for till haiff yschet out And saw the staill enwerounyt thaim about. Agayne thai went with hydwys strakis strang. Gret noyis and dyne was rayssit thaim amang, Thar cruell deide rycht merwalus to ken, Quhen xl macht agayne thre hundyr men. Wallace so weill apon him tuk that tide Throw the gret preys he maid a way full wide; Helpand the Scottis with his der-worthi hand Fell faymen he left fey vpon the land. Yheit Wallas lost xv in-to that steid, And xl men of Sothroun part war dede. The Butleris folk so fruschit was in deid The hardy Scottis to the strenthis throw thaim ?eide. On to Tay side thai hastyt thaim full fast; In will thai war the wattir till haiff past. Halff couth nocht swym that than with Wallas was And he wald nocht leiff ane and fra thaim pas. Bettir him thocht in perell for to be Wpon the land, than willfully to se His men to droun quhar reskew mycht he nane. Agayne In Ire to the feild ar thai gayne. Butler be than had putt his men in ray; On thaim he sett with ane awfull hard assay On athir side with wapynnys stiff off steill. Wallace agayne no frendschipe lett thaim feill. Bot do or de thai wist no mor socour. Thus fend thai lang in-to that stalwart stour. The Scottis chyftayne was ?ong and in a rage, Vsyt in wer and fechtis with curage. He saw his men off Sothroun tak gret wrang. Thaim to raweng all dreidles can he gang, For mony off thaim war bledand wondyr sar. He couth nocht se no help apperand thar Bot thar chyaftyne war putt out off thair gait, The bryme Butler, so bauldlye maid debait. Throu the gret preys Wallace to him socht. His awfull deid he eschewit as he mocht. Vndyr ane ayk wyth men about him set, Wallace mycht nocht a graith straik on him get. ?eit schede he thaim; a full royd slope was maid. The Scottis went out, no langar thar abaid. Stewyn off Irland, quhilk hardy was and wicht, To helpe Wallace he did gret preys and mycht, With trew Kerle douchty in mony deid. Wpon the grounde feill Sothroun gert thai bleid. Sexty war slayne off Inglismen in that place, And ix off Scottis thair tynt was throuch that cace. Butleris men so stroyit war that tide In-to the stour he wald no langar bide. To get supple he socht on to the staill. Thus lost he thar a hundreth off gret waill. As thai war best arayand Butleris rout. Betuex parteys than Wallace ischit out. Xvi with him thai graithit thaim to ga. Off all his men he had lewyt no ma. The Inglismen, has myssyt hym, in hy The hund thai tuk and folowit haistely. At the Gask woode full fayne he wald haiff beyne, Bot this sloth brache, quhilk sekyr was and keyne, On Wallace fute folowit so felloune fast, Quhill in thar sicht that prochit at the last. Thar hors war wicht, had soiorned weill and lang. To the next woode, twa myil thai had to gang Off vpwith erde, thai ?eid with all thar mycht. Gud hope thai had for it was ner the nycht. Fawdoun tyryt and said he mycht nocht gang. Wallace was wa to leyff him in that thrang. He bade him ga, and said the strenth was ner, Bot he tharfor wald nocht fastir him ster. Wallace in Ire on the crag can him ta With his gud suerd and strak the hed him fra. Dreidles to ground derfly he duschit dede. Fra him he lap and left him in that stede. Sum demys it to ill and othir-sum to gud, And I say her in-to thir termys rude, Bettir it was he did, as thinkis me. Fyrst to the hunde it mycht gret stoppyn be; Als Fawdoun was haldyn at suspicioun For he was knawin of brokill complexioun. Rycht stark he was and had bot litill gayne. Thus Wallace wist had he beyne left allayne, And he war fals to Enemys he wald ga, Gyff he war trew the Sothroun wald him sla. Mycht he do ocht bot tyne him as it was? Fra this questioun now schortlye will I pas. Deyme as ?he lest, ?e that best can and may, I bott rahers as my autour will say. Sternys be than began for till apper. The Inglismen was cummand wondyr ner. V hundreth haill was in thar chewalry. To the next strenth than Wallace couth him hy. Stewyn off Irland, wnwitting of Wallas, And gud Kerle, baid still ner-hand that place, At the mur syde in-till a scrogghy slaid Be est Dipplyne quhar thai this tary maid. Fawdoun was left besid thaim on the land. The power come and sodeynly him fand, For thair sloith hund the graith gait till him ?eid. Off othir trade scho tuk as than no heid. The sloith stoppyt, at Fawdoun still scho stude. No forthir scho wald fra tyme scho fand the blud. Inglismen dempt, for ellis thai couth nocht tell, Bot at the Scottis had fochtyn amang thaim sell. Rycht wa thai war that losyt was thar sent. Wallace twa men amang the ost in went, Dissemlit weylle that no man suld thaim ken, Rycht in affer as thai war Inglismen. Kerle beheld on to the bauld Heroun Vpon Fawdoun as he was lukand doun, A suttell straik wp-wart him tuk that tide; Wndir the chokkeis the grounden suerd gart glid By the gude mayle, bathe hals and his crag bayne In sondyr straik. Thus endyt that cheftayne. To grounde he fell, feile folk about him thrang. “Tresoune!”, thai criyt, traytouris was thaim amang. Kerlye with that fled out sone at a side. His falow Stewyn than thocht no tyme to bide. The fray was gret and fast away thai ?eid, Lawch towart Ern. Thus chapyt thai of dreid. Butler for woo off wepyng mycht nocht stynt. Thus raklesly this gud knycht haiff thai tynt. Thai demyt all that it was Wallace men Or ellis him self, thocht thai couth nocht him ken: “He is rycht ner, we sall him haif but faill. This febill woode may him litill awaill.” Xl thar past agayne to Sanct Ihonstoun With this dede cors, to berysing maid it boun, Partyt thar men, syne diuers wayis raid. A gret power at Dipplyn still thar baid. Till Dawryoch the Butler past but let. At syndry furdis the gait thai wmbeset; To kepe the wode quhill it was day thai thocht. As Wallace thus in the thik forrest socht, For his twa men in mynd he had gret payne; He wist nocht weill giff thai war tayne or slayne, Or chapyt haile be ony ieperte. Xiii war left with him, no ma had he. In the Gask hall thair lugyng haif thai tayne. Fyr gat thai sone, bot meyt than had thai nayne. Twa scheipe thai tuk besid thaim of a fauld, Ordanyt to soupe in-to that sembly hauld, Graithit in haist sum fude for thaim to dycht. So hard thai blaw rude hornys wpon hycht. Twa sende he furth to luk quhat it mycht be. Thai baid rycht lang and no tithingis herd he, Bot boustous noyis so brymly blew and fast. So othir twa in-to the woode furth past; Nane come agayne, bot boustously can blaw. In-to gret Ire he send thaim furth on raw. Quhen him allayne Wallace was lewyt thar The awfull blast aboundyt mekill mayr. Than trowit he weill thai had his lugyng seyne. His suerd he drew of nobill mettall keyne, Syn furth he went quhar at he hard the horne. With-out the dur Fawdoun was him beforn, As till his sycht his awne hed in his hand. A croys he maid quhen he saw him so stand. At Wallace in the hed he swaket thar, And he in haist sone hynt it by the hair, Syne out agayne at him he couth it cast. In-till his hart he was gretlye agast. Rycht weill he trowit that was no spreit of man, It was sum dewill at sic malice began. He wyst no waill thar langar for to bide. Vp throuch the hall thus wicht Wallace can glid Till a clos stair, the burdis raiff in twyne; Xv fute large he lap out of that In. Wp the wattir sodeynlye he couth fair. Agayne he blent quhat perance he sawe thar; Him thocht he saw Fawdoun that hugly Syr, That haill hall he had set in a fyr, A gret raftre he had in-till his hand. Wallace as than no langar walde he stand. Off his gud men full gret meruaill had he, How thai war tynt throuch his feyle fantase. Traistis rycht weill, all this was suth in deide, Suppos that it no poynt be of the creide. Power thai had witht Lucifer that fell The tyme quhen he partyt fra hewyn to hell. Be sic myscheiff giff his men mycht be lost, Drownyt or slayne amang the Inglis ost; Or quhat it was in liknes of Faudoun, Quhilk brocht his men to suddand confusioun; Or gif the man endyt in ewill entent, Sum wikkit spreit agayne for him present; I can nocht spek of sic diuinite, To clerkis I will let all sic materis be. Bot of Wallace furth I will ?ow tell. Quhen he wes went of that perrell fell ?eit glaid wes he that he had chapyt swa, Bot for his men gret murnyng can he ma, Flayt by him self to the makar off buffe Quhy he sufferyt he suld sic paynys pruff. He wyst nocht weill giff it wes goddis will, Rycht or wrang his fortoun to fullfill. Hade he plesd god, he trowit it mycht nocht be He suld him thoill in sic perplexite; Bot gret curage in his mynd euir draiff, Off Inglismen thinkand amendis to haiff. As he was thus walkand be him allayne, Apon Ern side makand a pytuous mayne, Schyr Ihone Butler to wache the furdis rycht, Out fra his men, of Wallace had a sicht. The myst wes went to the montanys agayne. Till him he raid quhar at he maid his mayne. On loude he sperd, “Quhat art thow walkis that gait?” “A trew man schir, thocht my wiage be layt. Erandis I pas fra Doun on to my lord. Schir Ihon Sewart, the rycht for to record, In Doune is now new cummyn fra the king.” Than Butler said, “This is a selcouth thing. Thou leid all out, thow has beyne with Wallace. I sall the knaw or thou cum of this place.” Till him he stert the courser wondyr wicht, Drew out a suerd, so maid hym for to lycht. Abowne the kne gud Wallas has him tayne, Throw the and brawn in sondyr straik the bayne. Derffly to dede the knycht fell on the land. Wallace the hors sone sesyt in his hand, Ane awkwart straik syne tuk him in that sted. His crag in twa, thus was the Butler dede. Ane Inglisman saw thar chiftayne wes slayn; A sper in reyst he kest with all his mayne, On Wallace draiff fra the hors him to ber. Warly he wrocht as worthi man in wer; The sper he wan, with-outyn mor abaid On hors he lap and throw a gret rout raid Till Dawryoch; he knew the ford full weill. Befor him come feyll stuffyt in fyne steill. He straik the fyrst but baid in the blasoune, Quhill hors and man bathe flet the wattir doune. Ane othir sone doun fra his hors he bar, Stampyt to grounde and drownyt with-outyn mar. The thrid he hyt in his harness of steyll Throw-out the cost; the sper to-brak sumdeyll. The gret power than efftir him can ryd. He saw na waill no langar thar to byd. His burnyst brand braithly in hand he bar. Quham he hyt rycht thai folowit him no mar. To stuff the chas feyll frekis folowit fast Bot Wallace maid the ganast ay agast. The mur he tuk and throw thar power ?eid. The hors was gud, bot ?eit he had greit dreid For fail?eing or he wan to a strenth. The chas was gret, scalyt our breid and lenth. Throw strang danger thai had him ay in sycht. At the Blakfurd thar Wallace doune can lycht. His hors stuffyt for the way was depe and lang; A large gret myile wichtly on fute couth gang. Or he was horst ridaris about him kest. He saw full weyll lang swa he mycht nocht lest. Sad men in deid wpon him can renew. With retornyng that nycht xx?? he slew. The forseast ay rudly rabutyt he, Kepyt his hors and rycht wysly can fle Quhill that he come the myrkest mur amang. His hors gaiff our and wald no forthyr gang. Wallace on fute tuk him with gude entent. The hors he straik or that he fra him went; His houch sennownnis he cuttyt all atanys And left him thus besyde the standand stanys, For Sotheron men no gud suld off him wyn. In heich haddyr Wallace and thai can twyn. Throuch that doun-with to Forth sadly he soucht, Bot sodandly than come in-till his thocht Gret power wok at Stirlyng bryg off tre. Seychand he said, “No passage is for me. For want off fude, and I haiff fochtyn lang, On wer-men now me thynk no tyme to gang. At Kamyskynnett I sall the wattir till. Lat god abowne do with me quhat he will. In-to this land langar I may nocht byd.” Tary he maid sum part on Forthis syd, Tuk off his weid and graithit him but mar. Hys swerd he band, that wondyr scharply schar, Amang his ger be his schuldris on loft. Thus In he went, to gret god prayand oft Off his hye grace the caus to tak on hand. Our the wattyr he swame to the south land; Arayede him sone, the sessone was rycht cauld, For Piscis was in-tyll his dayis of auld. Our-thwert the Kers to the Torwode he ?eide. A wedow thar duelt that helpyt him in neid. Hiddyr he come or day begouth to daw Till a wyndow and prewaly couth caw. Thai sperd his nayme bot tell thaim wald he nocht Quhill scho hir selff ner till his langage socht. Fra tyme scho wist at it was wicht Wallace Reiossyt scho wes and thankit god off his grace. Scho sperd sone quhy he was him allayne. Murnand he said, “As now may haiff I nane.” Scho askyt him quhar at his men suld be. “Fayr deyme,” he said, “go get sum meit for me. I haiff fastyt syne ?histerday at morn. I dreid full sar that my men be forlorn. Gret part of thaim to the dede I saw dycht.” Scho gat him meyt in all the haist scho mycht. A woman he cald and als with hyr a child, Syne bade thaim pas agayne thai wayis wild To the Gask hall, tithingis for to sper Giff part war left of his men in-to fer, And scho suld fynd a hors sone in hir gait. He bad thaim se giff that place stud in stait. Tharoff to her he had full gret desyr Becaus he thocht that it was all in fyr. Thai passyt furth with-outyn tary mar. Him for to rest Wallace ramaynit thar. Refreschit he wes with meyte, drynk and with heit, Quhilk causyt him throuch naturall cours to weit Quhar he suld sleipe in sekyrnes to be. The wedow had off hyr awne sonnys thre. Fyrst twa off thaim scho send to kepe Wallace, And gert the thrid go sone to Dwnypace And tald his Eyme that he was hapnyt thar. The persone ?eid to se of his weyllfar. Wallace to sleipe was laid in the wood syde. The twa ?onge men with-out hym ner couth byd. The persone come ner and thar maner saw. Thai beknyt him to quhat stede he suld draw. The Rone wes thik that Wallace slepyt In; About he ?eid and maid bot litill dyn, So at the last of him he had a sycht Full prewalye, how that his bed was dycht. He him beheld and said syne to him sell, “Her is merwaill, quha likis it to tell. This a persone be worthines of hand Trowys to stop the power of Ingland. Now fals fortoune, the myswyrkar of all, Be awentur has gyffyn him a fall, At he is left with-out supple of ma. A cruel wyff with wapynnys mycht him sla.” Wallace him herd quhen his slepe our-past; Fersly he rays and said till him als fast, “Thou leid fals preyst. War thow a fa to me I wald nocht dreid sic othir x as the. I haiff had mar syne ?histerday at morn Than syk sexty war semblyt me beforn.” His Eyme him tuk and went furth with Wallace. He tald till hym off all his paynfull cace: “This nycht,” he said, “I was left me allayne, In feyle debait with enemys mony ane. God at his will my liff did ay to kepe. Our Forth I swame, that awfull is and depe. Quhat I haiff had in wer befor this day, Presoune and payne, to this nycht was bot play, So bett I am with strakis sad and sar. The cheyle wattir vrned me mekill mar, Eftir gret blud throu heit in cauld was brocht, That off my lyff almost no thing I roucht. I meyn fer mar the tynsell off my men Na for my selff, mycht I suffir sic ten. The persone said, “Der sone, thow may se weyll Langar to stryff it helpis nocht adeyll. Thi men ar lost and nayne will with the rys. For goddis saik wyrk as I sall dewys, Tak a lordschipe quhar on at thow may liff. King Eduuard wald gret landis to the giff.” “Wncle,” he said, “off sic wordis no mar. This is no thing bot eking off my car. I lik bettir to se the Sothren de Than gold or land that thai can giff to me. Trastis rycht weyll, of wer I will nocht ces Quhill tyme that I bryng Scotland in-to pes, Or de tharfor, in playne to wndyrstand.” So come Kerle and gud Stewyn of Irland. The wedowis sone to Wallace he thaim brocht. Fra thai him saw of na sadnes thai roucht, For perfyt Ioy thai wepe with all thar Eyne. To ground thai fell and thankit hewynnys queyn. Als he was glaid for reskew off thaim twa. Off thair feris leyffand was left no ma. Thai tald till him that schir Garrat was dede, How thai had weyll eschapyt of that stede; Throuch the Oychall thai had gayne all that nycht Till Erth ferry or that the day was brycht; How a trew Scot for kyndnes off Wallace Brocht thaim sone oure, syne kend thaim to that place. Als Kerle wyst gyff Wallace leyffand war Nere Dwnypace that he suld fynd him thar. The persone gart gud purwiance for thaim dycht. In the Torwode thai lugyt all that nycht, Quhill the woman that Wallace north had send Retornd agayne and tald him till ane end Quhat Inglismen in the way scho fand dede. Feyll was fallyn fey in mony syndry sted. The hors scho saw that Wallace had berefft And the Gask hall standand as it was left, With-out harme, nocht sterd off it a stane, Bot off his men gud tithingis scho gat nane. Tharoff he grewyt gretlye in that tyd. In the forrest he wald no langar bid. The wedow him gaiff part off siluir brycht, Twa of hyr sonnys that worthi war and wycht; The thrid scho held becaus he lakit age, In wer as than mycht nocht wyn wesselage. The persone than gat thaim gud hors and ger, Bot wa he was his mynd wes all in wer. Thus tuk he leyff with-owtyn langar abaid. In Dundaff mur that sammyn nycht he raid. Schir Ihone the Grayme quhilk lord wes of that land, Ane agyt knycht, had maid nane othir band Bot purchest pes in rest he mycht bide still, Tribute payit full sor agayne his will. A sone he had bathe wys, worthi and wicht. Alexandyr the fers at Berweik maid him knycht, Quhar schawyn wes off battaill till haif beyne Betuex Scottis and the bauld Persie keyne. This ?ong schir Ihone rycht nobill wes in wer. On a braid scheyld his fadyr gert him swer He suld be trew till Wallace in all thing And he till him quhill lyff mycht in thaim ryng. Thre nychtis thar Wallace baid out off dreid, Restyt him weill, swa had he mekill neid. On the ferd day he wald no langar bide. Schir Ihone the Grayme bownyt with him to ryd, And he said nay, as than it suld nocht be: “A playne part ?eit I will nocht tak on me. I haiff tynt men throw my our rakles deid. A brynt child mayr sayr the fyr will dreid. Freyndis haiff I sumpart in Clyddysdaill; I will go se quhat may thai me awaill.” Schir Ihon ansuerd, “I will ?our consaill do. Quhen ?he se tyme send prewale me to. Than I sall cum with my power in haist.” He him be-tuk on-to the haly gaist, Saynct Ihone to borch, thai suld meite haill and sound. Out off Dundaff he and thir four couth found. In Bothwell mur that nycht remaynyt he With ane Craufurd that lugyt him preuale. Wpon the morn to the Gilbank he went, Rasauit was with mony glaid entent, For his der eyme ?ong Auchinlek duelt thar. Brothyr he was to the schirreff off Ayr. Quhen auld schir Ranald till his dede wes dycht. Than Awchinlek weddyt that lady brycht And childyr gat, as storyes will record, Off Lesmahago, for he held off that lord. Bot he was slayne, gret pete wes the mar, With Perseys men in-to the toun of Ayr. His sone duelt still, than xix ?eris off age, And brokit haille his fadris heretage. Tribute he payit for all his landis braid To lord Persie, as his brodyr had maid. I leyff Wallace with his der wncle still. Off Inglismen ?eit sum thing spek I will. A messynger sone throw the contre ?eid. To lord Persie thai tald this fellone deid; Kynclewyn was brynt, brokyn and castyn doun, The Captayn dede off it and Saynt Ihonstoun, The Loran als at Schortwod schawis scheyn: “In-to that land gret sorow has beyne seyn Throuch wicht Wallace that all this deid has done. The toune he spyit, and that forthocht we sone. Butler is slayne, with douchty men and deyr.” In aspre spech the Persye than can speyr, “Quhat worth of him, I pray ?ou graithlye tell”. “My lord,” he said, “rycht thus the cas befell. We knaw for treuth he was left him allayne, And as he fled he slew full mony ayne. The hors we fand that him that gait couth ber, Bot of hym self no othir word we her. At Stirlyng bryg we wait he passit nocht. To dede in Forth he may for vs be brocht.” Lord Persye said, “Now suthlye that war syne. So gud of hand is nayne this warld within. Had he tayne pes and beyne our kingis man The haill empyr he mycht haiff conquest than. Gret harme it is, our knychtis that ar ded. We mon ger se for othir in that sted. I trow nocht ?eit at Wallace losyt be. Our clerkys sayis he sall ger mony de.” The messynger said, “All that suth has beyne. Mony hundreth that cruell war and keyne Sene he begane ar lost with-out ramede.” The Persye said, “Forsuth he is nocht ded. The crukis off Forth he knawis wondyr weylle. He is on lyff, that sall our nacioune feill. Quhen he is strest than can he swym at will. Gret strenth he has, bathe wyt and grace thartill.” A messynger the lord chargyt to wend And this commaunde in wryt with him he send: Schir Ihone Sewart gret schirreff than he maid Off Sanct Ihonstoun and all thai landis braid. In-till Kynclewyn thar duelt nayne agayne. Thar was left nocht bot brokyn wallis in playne. Leiff I thaim thus reulland the landis thar And spek I will off Wallace glaid weillfar. He send Kerle to schir Ranald the knycht, Till Boyd and Blayr that worthi war and wicht And Adam als his cusyng gud Wallace; To thaim declarde off all this paynfull cas, Off his eschaipe out off that cumpany. Rycht wondyr glaid was this gud chewalry Fra tyme thai wyst that Wallace leiffand was. Gude expensis till him thai maid to pas. Maister Ihone Blayr was offt in that message, A worthy clerk, bath wys and rycht sawage. Lewyt he was befor in Parys toune Amang maisteris in science and renoune. Wallace and he at hayme in scule had beyne. Sone eftirwart, as verite is seyne, He was the man that pryncipall wndirtuk, That fyrst compild in dyt the Latyne buk Off Wallace lyff, rycht famous of renoun, And Thomas Gray persone off Libertoune. With him thai war and put in storyall, Offt ane or bath, mekilll of his trauaill, And tharfor her I mak off thaim mencioune. Master Ihone Blayr to Wallace maid him boune. To se his heyle his comfort was the mor, As thai full oft togyddyr war befor. Syluir and gold thai gaiff him for to spend. Sa dyde he thaim frely quhen god it send. Off gud weylfayr as than he wantyt nane. Inglismen wyst he was left him allane. Quhar he suld be was nayne off thaim couth say, Drownyt or slayne, or eschapyt away, Tharfor off him thai tuk bot litill heid. Thai knew him nocht, the les he was in dreid. All trew Scottis gret fauour till him gaiff, Quhat gude thai had he mysterit nocht to craiff. The pes lestyt that schir Ranald had tayne. Thai iiii monethis it suld nocht be out gane. This crystismes Wallace ramaynyt thar. In Laynrik oft till sport he maid repair. Quhen that he went fra Gilbank to the toune, And he fand men was off that fals nacioune To Scotland thai dyde neuir grewance mar. Sum stekyt thai, sum throttis in sondir schar. Feill war sone dede bot nane wyst quha it was. Quham he handlyt he leyt no forthir pas. Thar Hesylryg duelt, that curssyt knycht to waill. Schyrreff he was off all the landis haill, Felloune, owtrage, dispitfull in his deid; Mony off him tharfor had mekill dreid. Merwell he thocht quha durst his peple sla. With-out the toune he gert gret nowmir ga. Quhen Wallace saw that thai war ma than he, Than did he nocht but salust curtasle. All his four men bar thaim quietlik. Na Sotheron couth deme thaim mys, pur no rik. In Lanryk duelt a gentill woman thar, A madyn myld, as my buk will declar, Off xviii ?eris ald or litill mor off age. Als born scho was till part off heretage. Hyr fadyr was off worschipe and renoune And Hew Braidfute he hecht of Lammyngtoune, As feylle othir was in the contre cald. Befor-tyme thai gentill men war off ald. Bot this gud man and als his wiff wes ded. The madyn than wyst off no othyr rede, Bot still scho duelt on trewbute in the toune And purchest had king Eduuardis proteccioune. Serwandys with hyr, off freyndis at hyr will, Thus leyffyt scho with-out desyr off ill; A quiet hous as scho mycht hald in wer, For Hesylryg had done hyr mekill der, Slayne hyr brodyr quhilk eldast wes and ayr. All sufferyt scho and rycht lawly hyr bar. Amyabill, so benyng, war and wys, Curtas and swete, fulfillyt of gentrys, Weyll rewllyt off tong, rycht haill of contenance, Off wertuous scho was worthy till awance, Hummylly hyr led and purchest a gud name. Off Ilkyn wicht scho kepyt hyr fra blame. Trew rychtwys folk a gret fauour hir lent. Apon a day to the kyrk as scho went Wallace hyr saw as he his eyne can cast. The prent off luff him pun?eit at the last So asprely, throuch bewte off that brycht, With gret wnes in presence bid he mycht. He knew full weyll hyr kynrent and hyr blud And how scho was in honest oys and gud. Quhill wald he think to luff hyr our the laiff And othir quhill he thocht on his dissaiff, How that hys men was brocht to confusioun Throw his last luff he had in Saynct Ihonstoun. Than wald he think to leiff and lat our-slyd, Bot that thocht lang in hys mynd mycht nocht byd. He tauld Kerle off his new lusty baille, Syne askit him off his trew best consaill. “Maister,” he said, “as fer as I haiff feyll, Off lyklynes it may be wondir weill. Sen ?e sa luff, tak hir in mariage. Gudlye scho is and als has heretage. Suppos at ?he in luffyng feill amys Gret god forbede it suld be so with this!” “To mary thus I can nocht ?eit attend. I wald of wer fyrst se a finaill end. I will no mor allayne to my luff gang. Tak tent to me or dreid we suffer wrang. To proffer luff thus sone I wald nocht preffe. Mycht I leyff off, in wer I lik to leyff. Quhat is this luff? No thing bot folychnes. It may reiff men bathe witt and stedfastnes.” Than said he thus, “This will nocht graithly be, Amors and wer at anys to ryng in me. Rycht suth it is, stude I in blis off luffe, Quhar dedis war I suld the bettir pruff, Bot weyle I wait, quhar gret ernyst is in thocht It lattis wer in the wysest wys be wrocht, Les gyf it be bot only till a deid; Than he that thinkis on his luff to speid, He may do weill, haiff he fortoun and grace. Bot this standis all in ane othir cas, A gret kynryk with feill fayis ourset. Rycht hard it is amendis for to get At anys off thaim and wyrk the obserwance, Quhilk langis luff and all his frewill chance. Sampill I haif; this me forthinkis sar. I trow to god it sall be so no mar. The trewth I knaw off this and hyr lynage. I knew nocht hyr, tharfor I lost a gage.” To Kerle he thus argownd in this kynd, Bot gret desyr remaynt in-till his mynd For to behald that frely off fassoun. A quhill he left and come nocht in the toun. On othir thing he maid his witt to walk, Prefand giff he mycht off that languor slalk. Quhen Kerle saw he sufferit payne for-thi, “Der schir,” he said, “?e leiff in slogardy. Go se ?oure luf, than sall ?he get comfort.” At his consaill he walkit for to sport On to the kyrke quhar scho maid residence. Scho knew him weill bot as of eloquence Scho durst nocht weill in presens till him kyth. Full sor scho dred or Sotheron wald him myth, For Hesilryg had a mater new begone And hyr desirde in mariage till his sone. With hir madyn thus Wallace scho besocht To dyne with hyr, and prewaly hym brocht Throuch a garden scho had gart wyrk of new, So Inglismen nocht off thar metyng knew. Than kissit he this gudle with plesance, Syne hyr besocht rycht hartly of quentance. Scho ansuerd hym with humyll wordis wise: “War my quentance rycht worthi for till pryse ?he sall it haiff, als god me saiff in saille, Bot Inglismen gerris our power faill Throuch violence of thaim and thar barnage, At has weill ner destroyt our lynage.” Quhen Wallace hard hyr plen?e petously Agrewit he was in hart rycht gretumly. Bathe Ire and luff him set in-till a rage Bot nocht-forthi he soberyt his curage. Off his mater he tald as I said ayr To that gudlye, how luff him stren?eit sar. Scho ansuerd him rycht resonably agayne, And said, “I sall to ?our seruice be bayne With all plesance in honest causis haill; And I trast ?he wald nocht set till assaill, For ?houre worschipe, to do me dyshonour, And I a maid and standis in mony stour Fra Inglismen to saiff my womanheid, And cost has maid to kepe me fra thar dreid. With my gud wyll I wyll no lemman be To no man born; tharfor me think suld ?he Desyr me nocht bot in-till gudlynas. Perchance ?e think I war to law purchas For tyll attend to be your rychtwys wyff. In ?our seruice I wald oys all my lyff. Her I beseik, for ?our worschipe in armys, ?he charge me nocht with no wngudly harmys, Bot me defend for worschipe off ?our blude.” Quhen Wallace weyll hyr trew tayll wnderstud, As in a part hym thocht it was resoun Off hyr desir, tharfor till conclusioun He thankit hyr, and said, “Gif it mycht be Throuch goddis will that our kynryk war fre, I wald ?ow wed with all hartlie plesance, Bot as this tym I may nocht tak sic chance, And for this caus, none othir, now I crayff. A man in wer may nocht all plesance haiff.” Off thar talk than I can tell ?ow no mar, To my purpos, quhat band that thai maid thar. Conclud thai thus and syne to dyner went. The sayr grewans remaynyt in his entent, Los off his men and lusty payne off luff. His leiff he tuk at that tyme to ramuff, Syne to Gilbank he past or it was nycht. Apon the morn with his iiii men him dycht, To the Corhed with-out restyng he raid; Quhar his nevo Thom Haliday him baid, And Litill als, Eduuard his cusyng der, Quhilk was full blyth quhen he wyst him so ner, Thankand gret god that send him saiff agayne, For mony demyt he was in Strathern slayn. Gud cher thai maid all out thai dayis thre. Than Wallace said that he desirde to se Lowmaban toun and Ynglismen that was thar. On the ferd day thai bownyt thaim to far. Xvi he was of gudle chewalre. In the Knokwood he lewyt all bot thre. Thom Halyday went with him to the toun; Eduuard Litill and Kerle maid thaim boun. Till ane ostrye Thom Halyday led thaim rycht And gaiff commaund thar dyner suld be dycht. Till her a mes in gud entent thai ?eid. Off Inglismen thai trowit thar was no dreid. Ane Clyffurd come, was emys sone to the lord, And four with him, the trewth for to record. Quha awcht thai hors in gret heithing he ast. He was full sle and ek had mony cast. The gud wyff said, till applessyt him best, “Four gentill men is cummyn owt off the west.” “Quha dewill thaim maid so galy for to ryd? In faith with me a wed thar most abide. Thir lewit Scottis has leryt litill gud. Lo, all thar hors ar schent for faut off blud.” In-to gret scorn with outyn wordis mayr The taillis all off thai iiii hors thai schayr. The gud wyff cryede and petuously couth gret. So Wallace come and couth the captayne mete. A woman tald how thai his hors had schent. For propyr Ire he grew in matelent. He folowid fast and said, “Gud freynd, abid Seruice to tak for thi craft in this tyde. Marschell thou art with-out commaund off me. Reward agayne me think I suld pay the. Sen I off laitt now come owt off the west In this cuntre, a barbour off the best To cutt and schaiff, and that a wondir gude, Now thow sall feyll how I oys to lat blude.” With his gud suerd the captayn has he tayn Quhill hors agayne he marscheld neuir nayn; A nothir sone apon the hed strak he Quhill chaftis and cheyk vpon the gait can fle. Be that his men the tothir twa had slayne. Thar hors thai tuk and graithit thaim full bayne Out off the toun; for dyner baid thai nayne. The wyff he payit that maid so petuous mayne. Than Inglismen fra that chyftayne wes dede To Wallace socht fra mony syndry stede. Off the castell come cruell men and keyne. Quhen Wallace has thar sodand semle seyne Towart sum strenth he bownyt him to ryd, For than him thocht it was no tyme to byd. Thar hors bled fast, that gert him dredyng haiff. Off his gud men he wald haif had the laiff. To the Knokwoode with-outyn mor thai raid, Bot in-till it no soiornyng he maid; That wood as than was nothir thik no lang. His men he gat, syn lychtyt for to gang Towart a hicht and led thar hors a quhill. The Inglismen was than within a myill, On fresche hors rydand full hastely. Sewyn scor and ma was in thar chewalry. The Scottis lap on quhen thai thar power saw. Frawart the south thaim thocht it best to draw. Than Wallace said, “It is no witt in wer With our power to byd thaim bargane her. ?on are gud men, thar-for I rede that we Euirmar seik quhill god send sum supple.” Halyday said, “We sall do ?our consaille, Bot sayr I dreid or thir hurt hors will fayll.” The Inglismen in burnyst armour cler Be than to thaim approchyt wondir ner. Horssyt archaris schot fast and wald nocht spar. Off Wallace men thai woundyt twa full sar. In Ir he grew quhen that he saw thaim bleid. Him self retornde and on thaim sone he ?eid, Xvi with him that worthi was in wer. Off the formast rycht freschly doun thai ber. At that retorn xv in feild war slayne. The laiff fled fast to thar power agayne. Wallace folowid with his gud chewalrye. Thom Halyday in wer was full besye, A buschement saw that cruell was to ken, Twa hundreth haill off weill gerit Inglismen. “Wncle,” he said, “our power is to smaw. Off this playne feild I consaill ?ow to draw. To few we ar agayne ?on fellone staill.” Wallace relewit full sone at his consaill. At the Corheid full fayne thai wald haif beyne, Bot Inglismen weyll has thar purpos seyne. In playne battaill thai folowid hardely; In danger thus thai held thaim awfully. Hew off Morland on Wallace folowid fast. He had befor maid mony Scottis agast; Haldyn he was off wer the worthiast man In north Ingland, with thaim was leiffand than. In his armour weill forgyt off fyne steill A nobill cursour bur him bath fast and weill. Wallace retorned besyd a burly ayk And on him set a fellone sekyr straik; Baith cannell bayne and schuldir blaid in twa, Throuch the myd cost the gud suerd gert he ga. His speyr he wan and als the coursour wicht, Syne left his awn for he had lost his mycht; For lak off blud he mycht no forthir gang. Wallace on hors the Sotheron men amang, His men relewit, that douchty was in deid, Him to reskew out off that felloune dreid. Cruell strakis forsuth thar mycht be seyne On athir side quhill blud ran on the greyne. Rycht peralous the semlay was to se; Hardy and hat contenyt the fell melle, Skew and reskew off Scottis and Inglis als. Sum kerwyt bran in sondir, sum the hals, Sum hurt, sum hynt, sum derffly dong to dede; The hardy Scottis so steryt in that sted. With Halyday on fute bauldly that baid, Amang Sotheron a full gret rowme thai maid. Wallas on hors, in hand a nobill sper, Out throuch thaim raid as gud chyftayne in wer. Thre slew he thar or that his sper was gayn. Than his gud suerd in hand sone has he tayne, Hewyt on hard with dyntis sad and sar. Quhat ane he hyt grewyt the Scottis no mar. Fra Sotheron men be naturall resone knew How with a straik a man euir he slew, Than merwald thai he was so mekill off mayne; For thar best man in that kynd he had slayne, That his gret strenth agayne him helpyt nocht, Nor nane othir in-contrar Wallace socht. Than said thai all, “Lest he in strenth wntayne, This haill kynryk he wyll wyn him allayne.” Thai left the feild, syne to thar power fled And tald thar lord how ewill the formest sped; Quhilk Graystok hecht, was new cummyn in the land, Tharfor he trowit nane durst agayne him stand. Wondir him thocht quhen that he saw that sicht, Quhy his gud men for sa few tuk the flycht. At that retorn xx?? in feild was tynt, And Morland als; tharfor he wald nocht stynt Bot folowed fast with iii C but dreid, And swour he suld be wengit on that deid. The Scottis wan hors becaus thar awne couth faill, In fleyng syne chesd thaim the maist awaill. Owt off that feild thus wicht Wallas is gayn. Off his gud men he had nocht losyt ayne. V woundyt wes ?eit blythly furth thai raid. Wallace a space behynd thaim ay he baid, And Halyday prewyt weill in mony place. Sib sistir sone he wes to gud Wallace. Warly thai raid and held thar hors in aynd, For thai trowide weyll Sotheron wald afaynd With haill power at-anys on thaim to sett. Bot Wallace kest thar power for to let; To brek thar ray he besyit hym full fast. Than Inglismen so gretly wes agast That nane off thaim durst rusch out off the staill, All in a ray held thaim to-giddir haill. The Sotheron saw how that so bandounly Wallace abaid ner hand thar chewalry. Be Morlandis hors thai knew him wondyr weill, Past to thar Lord and tauld him euirilkdeill. “Lo schir,” thai said, “forsuth ?on sammyn is he That with his hand gerris so mony de. Haiff his hors grace apon his feyt to bid He dredis nocht throw v thousand to ryd. We rede ?e ces and folow him no mar, For drede that we repent it syn full sar.” He blamyt thaim and said, “Men weyll may se Cowartis ?e ar, that for so few wald fle.” For thar consaill ?eit leiff thaim wald he nocht. In gret Ire he apon thaim sadly socht, Wailland a place quhar he mycht bargane mak. Wallace was wa apon him for to tak, And he so few, to bid thaim on a playne. At Quenysbery he wald haiff beyne full fayne. Apon him self he tuk full gret trawaill To fend his men gyff that mycht ocht awaill. A suerd he drew rycht manlik him to wer, Ay wayttand fast gyff he mycht get a sper, Now her, now thar, befor thaim to and fra. His hors gaiff our and mycht no forthir ga. Rycht at the skyrt off Quenysbery befell, Bot wpon grace as my autour will tell, Schir Ihone the Grayme that worthi wes and wicht, To the Corhed come on the tothir nycht, Xxx?? with him off nobill men at wage. The fyrst dochtyr he had in mariage Off Halyday, was nevo to Wallace. Tithandis to sper schir Ihone past off that place With men to spek quhar thai a tryst had set, Rycht ner the steid quhar Scottis and Ynglis mete. Ane Kyrk-patryk that cruell was and keyne In Esdaill wood that half ?er he had beyne. With Inglis men he couth nocht weyll accord. Off Torthorowald he barron was and lord. Off kyn he was and Wallace modyr ner; Off Craufurd syd that mydward had to ster. Twenty he had off worthi men and wicht. Be than Wallace approchit to thar sicht. Schir Ihon the Grayme quhen he the cowntir saw, On thaim he raid and stud bot litill aw; His gud-fadyr he knew rycht wondyr weyll, Kest doun his sper and son?eit nocht adeyll, Kyrk-patryk als with worthi men in wer. Fyfty in fronte at-anys doun thai ber. Throuch the thikkest off thre hundreth thai raid. On Sotheron men full gret slauchtyr thai maid, Thaim to reskew that was in fellone thrang. Wallace, on fute the gret power amang, Gud rowme he gat throuch help off goddis grace. The Sotheren fled and left thaim in that place. Horsis thai wan to stuff the chas gud spede, Wallace and his that douchty wes in dede. Graystok tuk flycht. On stern horsis and stout A hundreth held to-gyddir in a rout. Wallace on thaim full sadly couth persew. The fleyng weyll off Inglis-men he knew, At ay the best wald pas with thar chyftayne. Befor him he fand gud schir Ihone the Grayme Ay strykand doun quham euir he mycht ourhy. Than Wallace said, “This is bot waist foly, Comons to slay quhar chyftayns gayis away. ?our hors is fresche, tharfor do as I say. Gud men ?he haiff ar ?eit in nobill stait. To ?on gret rout for goddis luff hald ?our gait. Sowndyr thaim sone. We sall cum at ?our hand.” Quhen schir Ihon had his tayll weyll wndirstand, Off nane othir fra thine-furth tuk he heid. To the formast he folowid weill gud speid. Kyrk-patryk als considiryt thar consaill. Than chargyt thar men, “All folow on the stayll.” At his command full sone with hym thay met, Sad straikys and sayr apone thaym sadly set. Schyr Ihone the Grayme to Graystok fast he socht; Hys prys pissan than helpyt him rycht nocht, Vpon the crage a graith straik gat him rycht. The burly blaide, was braid and burnyst brycht, In sonder kerwyt the mail?eis off fyne steyll. Throwch bayne and brawne it prochyt euirilkdeill, Dede with that dynt to the erd doun him draiff. Be that Wallace was semland with the laiff. Derfly to dede feyle frekys thar he dycht. Rays neuir agayne quhat ane at he hyt rycht. Kyrk-patryk than, Thom Halyday and thar men, Thar douchty deid was nobill for to ken. At the Knokheid the bauld Graystok was slayne And mony man quhilk wes off mekill mayne. To saiff thar lyff part in the wood is past. The Scottismen than relewit to-giddir fast. Quhen that Wallace with schir Ihone Grayme wes met Rycht gudlye he with humylnes him gret. Pardown he ast off the repreiff befor In-to the chas, and said he suld no mor Formacioune mak off him that was so gud. Quhen that schir Ihon Wallace weyll wndirstud, “Do way”, he said, “tharoff as now no mar. ?he dyd full rycht. It was for our weylfar. Wysar in weyr ?e ar all out than I. Fadir in armes ?e ar to me forthi.” Kyrk-patryk syne that wes his cusyng der, He thankit hym rycht on a gud maner. Nocht ane was lost off all thar chewalry. Schir Ihone the Grayme to thaim come happely. The day was downe and prochand wes the nycht; At Wallace thai askit his consaill rycht. He ansuerd thus, “I spek bot with ?our leiff. Rycht laith I war ony gud man to greyff, Bot thus I say in termes schort for me: I wald sail?e, gyff ?e think it may be, Lowmaban hous quhilk now is left allayne, For weyll I wait, power in it is lewyt nayne. Carlauerok als ?eit Maxwell has in hand. And we had this thai mycht be bath a wand Agayne Sotheroune that now has our cuntre. Say quhat ?e will, this is the best think me.” Schir Ihone the Grayme gaiff fyrst his gud consent, Syne all the layff rycht with a haill entent. To Lowmaban rycht haistely thai ryd. Quhen thai cum ner, nocht half a myill besid, The nycht was myrk, to consaill ar thai gayne. Off mwne nor stern gret perans was thar nayne. Than Wallace said, “Me think the land at rest. Thom Haliday, thow knawis this cuntre best. I her no noyis of feyll folk her about. Tharfor I trow we ar the les in doubt.” Haliday said, “I will tak ane with me And ryde befor the maner for to se.” Watsone he callit: “With me thow mak the boun. With thaim thow was a nychtbour off this toun.” “I grant I was with thaim, agayne my will. Myn entent is euir to do tham Ill.” Onto the ?eitt thir twa pertly furth raid. The portar come with-owt langar abaid. At Ihone Watsone sone tythandis he couth as. Opyn he bad, the Captayne cummand was. The ?ett but mayr wnwysly he wp drew. Thom Haliday sone be the craig him threw And with a knyff he stekit him to dede, In a dyrk holl kest him doun in that sted. Ihone Watsone syne has hynt the keyis in hand. The power than with Wallace wes cummand. Thai entryt In, befor thaim fand no ma Excep wemen, and sympill serwandis twa In the kyching scudleris lang tyme had beyne. Sone thai war slayne. Quhen the Lady had thaim seyne, “Grace,” scho cryit, “for hym that deit on tre.” Than Wallace said, “Mademe, ?our noyis lat be. To wemen ?eit we do bot litill Ill, Na ?ong childir we lik nocht for to spill. I wald haiff meit. Haliday, quhat sayis thow? For fastand folk to dyne gud tym war now.” Gret purwiance was ordand thaim befor, Bath breid and aylle, gud wyne and othir stor. To meyt thai bownyt for thai had fastyt lang; Gud men off armes in-to the clos gert gang. Part fleand folk on fute that fra thaim glaid On the Knok-heid, quhar gret melle was maid, Ay as thai come Ihon Watsone leit thaim in And donn to dede with-outyn noyis or dyn. Na man left thar that was off Ingland born. The castell weyll thai wesyt on the morn, For Ihonstoun send, a man off gud degre. Secund dochtir forsuth weddyt had he Off Halidays, nere neuo to Wallace. Gret captayne thai made him off that place. Thai leyffit him thar in-till a gud aray, Syne wsched furth wpon the secund day. Women had leyff in Ingland for to fayr. Schyr Ihon the Grayme and gud Wallace couth cair To the Corhed and lugyt all that nycht. Wpon the morn the sone wes at the hycht; Eftir dyner thai wald no langer byde, Thar purpos tuk in Craufurd mur to ryd, Schyr Jhon the Grayme with Wallace that was wycht. Thom Haliday agayne retorned rycht To the Cor hall and thar remanyt but dred. Na Sotheroun wyst prynsuall quha did this dede. Kyrk-patrik past in Aisdaill woddis wyd. In saufte thar he thoucht he suld abid. Schyr Jhone the Grayme and gud Wallace in feir, With thaim xl off men in armes cleir, Throuch Craufurd mur as that thai tuk the way On Inglismen thar mynd ramaynit ay. Fra Crawfurd Ihon the wattir doune thai ryd. Ner-hand the nycht thai lychtyt apon Clyd, Thar purpos tuk in-till a quiet waill. Than Wallace said, “I wald we mycht assaill Craufurd castell with sum gud ieperte. Schir Ihon the Grayme, how say ?he best may be?” This gud knycht said, “And the men war with-out, To tak the hous thar is bot litill dout.” A squier than rewllyt that lordschip haill, Off Cummyrland borne, his name was Martyndaill. Than Wallace said, “My selff will pas in feyr And ane with me off herbre for to speyr. Folow on dreich giff that we mystir ocht.” Edward Litill with his mastir furth socht Till ane oystry and with a woman met. Scho tald to thaim that Sothroune thar was set. “And ?e be Scottis I consaill ?ow pas by, For and thai may ?he will get ewill herbry. At drynk thai ar, so haiff thai bene rycht lang. Gret worde thar is of Wallace thaim amang. Thai trow that he has found his men agayne. At Lowchmaban feyll Inglismen ar slayne. That hous is tynt; that gerris thaim be full wa. I trow to god that thai sall swne tyne ma.” Wallace sperd of Scotland giff scho be. Scho said him, “?a, and thinkis ?et to Se Sorou on thaim throw help off goddis grace.” He askit hyr quha was in-to the place. “Na man of fens is left that hous within. Xx?? is her makand gret noyis and dyn. Allace”, scho said, “giff I mycht anys Se The worthy Scottis maist maister In it to be!” With this woman he wald no langar stand. A bekyn he maid; schir Ihon come at his hand. Wallace went in and bad bendicite. The Capteyne speryt, “Quhat bellamy may thow be That cummys so grym? Sum tithandis till vs tell. Thou art a Scot. The dewill thi nacioune quell!” Wallace braid out his suerd with-outyn mar; In-to the breyst the bryme Captayne he bar Throuch-out the cost and stekit him to ded. Ane othir he hyt awkwart vpon the hed. Quham euir he strak he brystyt bayne and lyr. Feill off thaim dede fell thwortour in the fyr. Haisty payment he maid thaim on the flur, And Eduuard Litill kepyt weill the dur. Schir Ihon the Graym full fayne wald haiff beyne In. Eduuard him bad, “At the castell begyne, For off thir folk we haiff bot litill dreid.” Schir Ihon the Grayme fast to the castell ?eid. Wallace rudly sic routis to thaim gaiff Thai twenty men derffly to dede thai draiff. Xv he straik and xv has he slayne. Edward slew v quhilk was off mekill mayne. To the castell Wallace had gret desyr. Be that Schir Ihone had set the ?ett in fyr. Nane wes tharin at gret defens couth ma, Bot wemen fast sar wepand in-to wa. With-out the place ane ald bulwark was maid. Wallace ?eid our with-out langar abaid. The wemen swne he sauffyt fra the dede; Waik folk he put and barnys off that stede. Off purwiaunce thai fand litill or nane; Befor that tyme thar wictaill was all gayne. ?eit in that place thai lugyt still that nycht, Fra oystre brocht sic gudis as thai mycht. Wpon the morn the hous thai spoil?e fast. All thing that doucht out off that place thai cast. Tre-wark thai brynt that was in-to tha wanys, Wallis brak doun that stalwart war off stanys, Spylt at thai mycht, syne wald no langar bid. On till Dundaff that sammyn nycht thai ryde And lugit thar with myrthis and plesance, Thankand gret god that lent thaim sic a chance. BOOK VI Than passit was wtas off Feuir?her And part off Marche off rycht degestioune. Apperyd than the last moneth off Wer, The syng off somir with his suet sessoun. Be that Wallace off Dundaff maid him boune, His leyff he tuk and to Gilbank can fair. The rewmour rais throuch Scotland vp and doun, With Inglismen, that Wallace leiffand war. In Aperill, quhen cleithit is but weyne The abill ground be wyrking off natur, And woddis has won thar worthy weid off greyne; Quhen Nympheus, in beldyn off his bour With oyle and balm fullfillit off suet odour, Faunis maceris, as thai war wount to gang, Walkyn thar cours in euiry casuall hour To glaid the huntar with thar merye sang— In this samyn tyme to him approchit new His lusty payne, the quhilk I spak off ayr. Be luffis cas he thocht for to persew In Laynryk toune and thiddir he can fayr; At residence a quhill ramaynit thair In hyr presence as I said off befor. Thocht Inglismen was grewyt at his repayr, ?eit he desyrd the thing that sat him sor. The feyr off wer rewllyt him on sic wis He likit weyll with that gudlye to be. Quhill wald he think off danger for to rys And othir quhill out of hir presens fle: “To ces off wer it war the best for me. Thus wyn I nocht bot sadnes on all syde. Sall neuir man thus cowartys in me Se! To wer I will for chance that may betyd! Qwhat is this luff? It is bot gret myschance, That me wald bryng fra armes wtterly. I will nocht los my worschip for plesance. In wer I think my tyme till occupy. ?eit hyr to luff I will nocht lat forthy. Mor sall I desyr hyr frendschip to reserue Fra this day furth than euir befor did I, In fer off wer quhethir I leiff or sterue”. Qwhat suld I say? Wallace was playnly set To luff hyr best in all this warld so wid, Thinkand he suld off his desyr to get; And so befell be concord In a tid That scho was maid at his commaund to bid, And thus began the styntyn off this stryff, Begynnyng band with graith witnes besyd. Myn auctor sais scho was his rychtwys wyff. Now leiff in pees, now leiff in gud concord, Now leyff in blys, now leiff in haill plesance, For scho be chos has bath hyr luff and lord; He thinkis als luff did him hye awance, So ewynly held be fauour the ballance, Sen he at will may lap hyr in his armys. Scho thankit god off hir fre happy chance, For in his tyme he was the flour off armys. Fortoun him schawit hyr fygowrt, doubill face. Feyll sys or than he had beyne set abuff; In presoune now, delyuerit now throw grace; Now at vnes, now in-to rest and ruff; Now weyll at wyll weyldand his plesand luff, As thocht him selff out off aduersite; Desyring ay his manheid for to pruff, In curage set apon the stagis hye. The werray treuth I can nocht graithly tell In-to this lyff how lang at thai had beyne; Throuch naturall cours off generacioune befell A child was chewyt thir twa luffaris betuene, Quhilk gudly was, a maydyn brycht and schene. So forthyr furth be ewyn tyme off hyr age A squier Schaw, as that full weyll was seyne, This lyflat man hyr gat in mariage. Rycht gudly men come off this lady ?ing. Forthyr as now off hyr I spek no mar. Bot Wallace furth in-till his wer can ryng; He mycht nocht ces, gret curage so him bar. Sotheroun to sla for dreid he wald nocht spar, And thai oft sys feill causis till him wrocht, Fra that tyme furth quhilk mowit hym fer mar, That neuir in warld out of his mynd was brocht. Now leiff thi myrth, now leiff thi haill plesance, Now leiff thi blis, now leiff thi childis age, Now leiff thi ?outh, now folow thi hard chance, Now leyff thi lust, now leiff thi mariage. Now leiff thi luff, for thow sall los a gage Quhilk neuir in erd sall be redemyt agayne. Folow fortoun and all hir fers owtrage. Go leiff in wer, go leiff in cruell payne. Fy on fortoun, fy on thi frewall quheyll, Fy on thi traist, for her it has no lest. Thow transfigowryt Wallace out off his weill Quhen he traistyt for till haiff lestyt best. His plesance her till him was bot a gest. Throw thi fers cours that has na hap to ho Him thow our-threw out off his likand rest, Fra get plesance in wer, trawaill and wo. Quhat is fortune? Quha dryffis the dett so fast? We wait thar is bathe weill and wykit chance, Bot this fals warld with mony doubill cast, In it is nocht bot werray wariance. It is nothing till hewynly gowernance. Than pray we all to the makar abow, Quhilk has in hand off iustry the ballance, That he vs grant off his der lestand lowe. Her-off as now forthyr I spek no mar, Bot to my purpos schortly will I fayr. Tuelff hundreth ?er tharto nynte and sewyn Fra Cryst wes born the rychtwis king off hewyn, Wil?ham Wallace in-to gud liking gais In Laynrik toun amang his mortaill fais. The Inglismen that euir fals has beyne, With Hesilryg quhilk cruell was and keyn And Robert Thorn a felloune sutell knycht, Has founde the way be quhat meyn best thai mycht, How that thai suld mak contrar to Wallace: Be argument, as he come vpon cace On fra the kyrk that was without the toun, Quhill thar power mycht be in harnes boun. Schyr Ihon the Grayme, bathe hardy, wys and trew, To Laynrik come gud Wallace to persew Off his weyllfayr, as he full oft had seyne. Gud men he had in cumpany xv And Wallace ix, thai war na feris ma. Wpon the morn wnto the mes thai ga, Thai and thar men graithit in gudly greyn; For the sesson sic oys full lang has beyne. Quhen sadly thai had said thar deuocioune, Ane argwnde thaim as thai went throuch the toun, The starkast man that Hesylryg than knew, And als he had off lychly wordis ynew. He salust thaim as it war bot in scorn: “Dewgar, gud day, bone sen?hour and gud morn.” “Quhom scornys thow?,” quod Wallace. “Quha lerd the?” “Quhy, schir”, he said, “come ?he nocht new our se? Pardown me than, for I wend ?e had beyne Ane Inbasset to bryng ane wncouth queyne.” Wallace ansuerd, “Sic pardoune as we haiff In oys to gyff thi part thow sall nocht craiff.” “Sen ?e ar Scottis ?eit salust sall ?e be— Gud deyn, dawch Lard, bach lowch, ban?och a de.” Ma Sotheroune men to thaim assemblit ner. Wallace as than was laith to mak a ster. Ane maid a scrip and tyt at his lang suorde. “Hald still thi hand,” quod he, “and spek thi word.” “With thi lang suerd thow makis mekill bost”. “Tharoff,” quod he, “thi deme maid litill cost”. “Quhat caus has thow to wer that gudlye greyne?” “My maist caus is bot for to mak the teyne”. “Quhat suld a Scot do with so fair a knyff?” “Sa said the prest that last Ianglyt thi wyff. That woman lang has tillit him so fair Quhill that his child worthit to be thine ayr.” “Me think”, quod he, “thow drywys me to scorn.” “Thi deme has beyne Iapyt or thow was born”. The power than assemblyt thaim about, Twa hundreth men that stalwart war and stout. The Scottis saw thar power was cummand, Schir Robert Thorn and Hesilryg at hand, The multitude wyth wappynnys burnist beyne. The worthi Scottis, quhilk cruell was and keyne, Amang Sotherone sic dyntis gaiff that tyd Quhill blud on breid byrstyt fra woundis wyd. Wallace in stour wes cruelly fechtand. Fra a Sotheroune he smat off the rycht hand, And quhen that carle off fechtyng mycht no mar With the left hand in Ire held a buklar; Than fra the stowmpe the blud out spurgyt fast, In Wallace face aboundandlye can out cast. In-to gret part it merryt off his sicht. Schyr Ihone the Grayme a straik has tayne him rycht With hys gud suerd vpon the Sotherone Syr, Derffly to ded draiff him in-to that Ire. The perell was rycht awfull, hard and strang. The stour enduryt merwalusly and lang. The Inglismen gaderit fellone fast. The worthi Scottis the gait left at the last. Quhen thai had slayne and woundyt mony man, Till Wallace In the gaynest way thai can Thai passit swne, defendand tham richt weill, He and schir Ihone with suerdis stiff of steill Behind thar men, quhill thai the ?ett had tayne. The woman than, quhilk was full will off wayne, The perell saw with fellone noyis and dyne, Gat wp the ?ett and leit thaim entir In. Throuch till a strenth thai passit off that steid. L Sotheroun vpon the gait wes dede. This fair woman did besines and hir mycht The Inglismen to tary with a slycht, Quhill that Wallace on to the wood wes past. Than Cartlane craggis thai persewit full fast. Quhen Sotheroun saw that chapyt wes Wallace Agayne thai turnyt, the woman tuk on cace, Put hir to dede, I can nocht tell ?ow how. Off sic mater I may nocht tary now. Quhar gret dulle is bot rademyng agayne Newyn off it is bot ekyng off payne. A trew woman, had seruit hir full lang, Out off the toun the gaynest way can gang, Till Wallace tald how all this deid was done. The paynfull wo socht till his hart full sone; War nocht for schayme he had socht to the ground For bytter baill that in his breyst was bound. Schir Ihone the Grayme, bath wys, gentill and fre, Gret murnynge maid that pete was to se, And als the laiff that was assemblit thar For pur sorou wepyt with hart full sar. Quhen Wallace feld thar curage was so small He fen?eit him for to comfort thaim all. “Ces men”, he said, “this is a butlas payne. We can nocht now chewys hyr lyff agayne”. Wnes a word he mycht bryng out for teyne. The bailfull teris bryst braithly fra his eyne. Sichand he said, “Sall neuir man me se Rest in-till eys quhill this deid wrokyn be, The saklace slauchtyr off hir blith and brycht. That I awow to the makar off mycht, That off that nacioune I sall neuir forber ?hong nor ald that abill is to wer. Preystis no wemen I think nocht for to sla In my defaut, bot thai me causing ma. Schir Ihon”, he said, “lat all this murnyng be, And for hir saik thar sall x M de. Quhar men may weipe thar curage is the les; It slakis Ire off wrang thai suld radres.” Off thar complaynt as now I say no mar. Gud Awchinlek off Gilbank, duelyt thar, Quhen he hard tell off Wallace wexacioune, To Cartlane wood with x men maid him boune. Wallace he fand sum-part with-in the nycht. To Laynryk toun in all haist thai thaim dycht; The wache off thaim as than had litill heid; Partyt thar men and diuers gatis ?eid. Schir Ihone the Grayme and his gud cumpany To schir Robert off Thorn full fast thai hy. Wallace and his to Hesilrige sone past In a heich hous quhar he was slepand fast, Straik at the dure with his fute hardely Quhill bar and brais in the flair he gart ly. The schirreff criyt, “Quha makis that gret deray?” “Wallace”, he said, “that thow has socht all day. The womannis dede, will god, thow sall der by”. Hesilrige thocht it was na tyme to ly, Out off that hous full fayne he wald haiff beyne. The nycht was myrk ?eit Wallace has him seyne, Freschly him straik as he come in gret Ire, Apon the heid birstit throuch bayne and lyr. The scherand suerd glaid till his coler bayne. Out our the stayr amang thaim is he gayne. Gude Awchinlek trowit nocht that he was dede, Thrys with a knyff stekit him in that stede. The scry about rais rudly on the streyt; Feyll off the layff war ful?eit wndir feyt. ?ong Hesilryg and wicht Wallace is met; A sekyr strak Wil?ham has on him set, Derffly to dede off the stair dang him doun. Mony thai slew that nycht in Laynrik toune, Sum grecis lap and sum stekit with-in. A-ferd thai war with hidwis noyis and dyne. Schir Ihone the Grayme had set the hous in fyr Quhar Robert Thorn was brynt wp bayne and lyr. Xii scor thai slew that wes off Ingland born. Wemen thai lewit and preistis on the morn To pas thar way, off blys and gudis bar, And swor that thai agayne suld cum no mar. Quhen Scottis hard thir fyne tithingis off new Out off all part to Wallace fast thai drew, Plenyst the toun quhilk was thar heretage. Thus Wallace straiff agayne that gret barnage. Sa he begane with strenth and stalwart hand To chewys agayne sum rowmys off Scotland. The worthy Scottis that semblit till him thar Chesit him for cheyff, thar chyftayne and ledar. Amer Wallang, a suttell terand knycht, In Bothwell duelt, king Eduuardis man full rycht. Murray was out, thocht he was rychtwys lord Off all that land, as trew men will racord; In-till Aran he was duelland that tyd, And othir ma, in this land durst nocht bide. Bot this fals knycht, in Bothwell wonnand was, A man he gert sone to king Eduuard pas And tald him haill off Wallace ordinance, How he had put his pepill to myschance And playnly was ryssyn agayne to ryng. Grewit tharat rycht gretly wes the king. Throuch all Ingland he gart his doaris cry, Power to get, and said he wald planly In Scotland pas that rewme to statut new. Feill men off wer till him full fast thai drew. The queyne feld weill how that his purpos was. Till him scho went, on kneis syne can him as He wald resist and nocht in Scotland gang; He suld haiff dreid to wyrk so felloune wrang: “Crystyne thai ar, ?one is thar heretage. To reyff that croune, that is a gret owtrage.” For hyr consaill at hayme he wald nocht byde. His lordis hym set in Scotland for to ryde. A Scottis man, than duellyt with Eduuard, Quhen he hard tell that Wallace tuk sic part He staw fra thaim als preuale as he may. In-to Scotland he come apon a day. Sekand Wallace he maid him reddy boune. This Scot was born at Kyle in Rycardtoune. All Ingland cost he knew it wondyr weill, Fra Hull about to Brysto euirilkdeill, Fra Carleill throuch Sandwich that ryoll stede, Fra Douer our on to Sanct Beis hede. In Pykearte and Flandrys he hade beyne, All Normonde and Frans haill he had seyne; A pursiwant till king Eduuard in wer Bot he couth neuir gar him his armes ber. Off gret statur and sum-part gray wes he. The Inglismen cald him bot Grymmysbe. To Wallace come and in-to Kile him fand. He tald him haill the tithandis off Ingland. Thai turnyt his name fra tyme that thai him knew And cald him Iop; off Ingen he wes trew, In all his tyme gud seruice in him fand, Gaiff him to ber the armes off Scotland. Wallace agayne in Cliddisdaill sone raid And his power semblit with-outyn baid. He gart commaund, quha that his pees wald tak, A fre remyt he suld ger to thaim mak For alkyn deid that thai had doyne beforn. The Perseys pees and schir Ranaldis wes worn. Feill till him drew that bauldly durst abid Off Wallace kyn fra mony diuers sid. Schir Ranald than send him his power haill; Him selff durst nocht be knawine in battaill Agayne Sotheroun, for he had made a band Lang tyme befor to hald off thaim his land. Adam Wallace past out off Ricardtoun, And Robert Boid with gud men of renoun. Off Cunyngayme and Kille come men off waill, To Laynrik socht on hors, a thousand haill; Schyr Ihone the Grayme and his gud chewalre, Schir Ihone off Tynto with men that he mycht be, Gud Awchinlek that Wallace wncle was— Mony trew Scot with that chyftayne couth pas: Thre thousand haill off likly men in wer And feill on fute quhilk wantyt hors and ger. The tyme be this was cummand apon hand, The awfull ost with Eduuard off Ingland To Beggar come, with sexte thousand men In wer wedis that cruell war to ken. Thai playntyt thar feild with tentis and pail?onis, Quhar claryowns blew full mony mychty sonis; Plenyst that place with gud wictaill and wyne, In cartis brocht thar purwiance dewyne. The awfull king gert twa harroldis be brocht, Gaiff thaim commaund in all the haist thai mocht To charge Wallace, that he sulde cum him till Witht-out promys and put him in his will: “Be-caus we wait he is a gentill man, Cum in my grace and I sall saiff him than. As for his lyff I will apon me tak, And efftir this gyff he couth seruice mak, He sall haiff wage that may him weill suffice. That Rebald wenys, for he has done supprice To my pepill oft apon awentur. Agaynys me he may nocht lang endur. To this proffyr gaynstandand giff he be, Her I awow he sall be hyngyt hye. A ?ong squier, was brothir to Fehew, He thocht he wald dysgysit to persew Wallace to se, that tuk so hie a part. Born sistir sone he was to king Eduuart. A cot off armes he tuk on him but baid. With the harroldis full prewaly he raid To Tynto hill with-outyn residens, Quhar Wallace lay with his folk at defence. A likly ost as off so few thai fand. Till hym thai socht and wald no langar stand: “Gyff ?e be he that rewllis all this thing, Credence we haiff brocht fra our worthi king”. Than Wallace gert thre knychtis till him call, Syne red the wryt in presens off thaim all. To thaim he said, “Ansuer ?e sall nocht craiff. Be wryt or word, quhilk likis ?ow best till haiff?” “In wryt”, thai said, “it war the liklyast”. Than Wallace thus began to dyt in hast: “Thow reyffar king chargis me throw cas That I suld cum and put me in thi grace. Gyff I gaynstand thow hechtis till hyng me. I wow to God and euir I may tak the Thow sall be hangyt, ane exempill to geiff To kingis off reyff als lang as I may leiff. Thow profferis me thi wage for till haiff. I the defy, power and all the laiff At helpis the her off thi fals nacioun. Will god thow sall be put off this regioune, Or de tharfor, contrar thocht thow had suorn. Thow sall ws se or ix houris to-morn Battaill to gyff magra off all thi kyn, For falsly thow sekis our rewme with-in.” This wryt he gaiff to the harraldis but mar And gud reward he gart delyuir thaim thar. Bot Iop knew weyll the squier ?ong Fehew And tald Wallace, for he was euir trew. Than he command that thai suld sone thaim tak. Him selff began a sair cusyng to mak. “Squier”, he said, “sen thow has fen?eit armys, On the sall fall the fyrst part off thir harmys, Sampill to geyff till all thi fals nacioune”. Apon the hill he gert thaim set him downe, Straik off his hed or thai wald forthyr go; To the herrold said syne with-outyn ho, “For thow art fals till armys and maynsuorn Throuch thi chokkis thi tong sall be out schorn”. Quhen that was doyne than to the thrid said he, “Armys till iuge thow sall neuir graithly se”. He gert a smyth with his turkas rycht thar Pow out his eyne, syne gaiff thaim leiff to far: “To ?our fals king thi falow sall the leid. With my ansuer turs him his newois heid. Thus sar I drede thi king and all his bost”. His dum falow led hym on to thar ost. Quhen king Eduuard his herroldis thus has seyne In propyr Ire he wox ner wode for teyne, That he nocht wyst on quhat wis him to wreke. For sorow almaist a word he mycht nocht spek. A lang quhill he stud wrythand in a rage. On loud he said, “This is a fell owtrage. This deid to Scottis full der it sall be bocht. Sa dispitfull in warld was neuir wrocht. Off this regioun I think nocht for to gang Quhill tyme that I sall se that Rybald hang”. Lat I him thus in-till his sorow duell. Off thai gud Scottis schortly I will ?ow tell. Furth fra his men than Wallace rakit rycht. Till him he cald schir Ihon Tynto the knycht, And leit him witt to wesy him selff wald ga The Inglis ost, and bad him tell na ma, Quhat euir thai speryt, quhill that he come agayne. Wallace dysgysit thus bownyt our the playne. Betwix Cultir and Bygar as he past He was sone war quhar a werk-man come fast, Dryfande a mere and pychars had to sell. “Gud freynd”, he said, “in treuth will thow me tell With this chaffar quhar passis thow treuly?” “Till ony, schir, quha likis for to by. It is my crafft and I wald sell thaim fayne”. “I will thaim by, sa god me saiff fra payne. Quhat price lat her. I will tak thaim ilkayne”. “Bot half a mark, for sic prys haiff I tayne”. “Xx?? schillingis”, Wallace said, “thow sall haiff. I will haiff mer, pychars and als the laiff. Thi gowne and hois in haist thow put off syne And mak a chang, for I sall geyff the myne, And thi ald hud becaus it is thred-bar”. The man wend weyll that he had scornyt him thar. “Do tary nocht, it is suth I the say”. The man kest off his febill weid off gray, And Wallace his and payit siluir in hand. “Pas on”, he said, “thou art a proud merchand”. The gown and hois in clay that claggit was, The hude heklyt, and maid him for to pas. The qwhipe he tuk, syne furth the mar can call. Atour a bray the omast pot gert fall, Brak on the ground; the man lewch at his fair, “Bot thow be war thow tynys off thi chaiffair”. The sone be than was passit out off sicht, The day our went and cummyn was the nycht. Amang Sotheroun full besyly he past. On athir side his eyne he gan to cast Quhar lordis lay and had thar lugeyng maid, The kingis pal?one quhar-on the libardis baid; Spyand full fast quhar his awaill suld be And couth weyll luk and wynk with the ta E. Sum scornyt him, sum ‘gleid carll’ cald him thar; Agrewit thai war for thar herroldis mysfayr. Sum sperd at him how he sald off the best. “For xl pens”, he said, “quhill thai may lest”. Sum brak a pott, sum pyrlit at his E. Wallace fled out and prewale leit thaim be. On till his ost agayne he past full rycht. His men be than had tane Tynto the knycht. Schyr Ihon the Grayme gert bynd him wondyr fast, For he wyst weill he was with Wallace last. Sum bad byrn him, sum hang him in a cord. Thai swor that he had dissawit thar lord. Wallace be this was entryt thaim amang. Till him he ?eid and wald nocht tary lang, Syne he gart lous him off thai bandis new And said he was baith suffer, wys and trew. To souper sone thai bound but mar abaid. He tald to thaim quhat merket he had maid And how at he the Sotheroun saw full weill. Schyr Ihon the Grayme displessit was sumdeill And said till him, “Nocht chyftaynlik it was Throw wilfulnes in sic perell to pas”. Wallace ansuerd, “Or we wyn Scotland fre Bath ?e and I in mar perell mon be, And mony othir the quhilk full worthi is. Now off a thing we do sumpart amys, A litill slepe I wald fayne that we had, With ?one men syne luk how we may ws glaid.” The worthi Scottis tuk gud rest quhill ner day. Than rais thai wp; till ray sone ordand thai. The hill thai left and till a playne is gayne. Wallace him selff the wantgard he has tayne. With him was Boid and Awchinlek but dreid, With a thousand off worthi men in weid. Als mony syne in the mydwart put he. Schir Ihone the Grayme he gert thar ledar be, With him Adam ?oung lord off Ricardtoun And Someruaill a squier off renoun. The thrid thousand in the rerward he dycht, Till Waltir gaiff off Newbyggyn the knycht, With him Tynto that douchty wes in deid And Daui son off schir Waltir, to leid. Behynd thaim ner the fute-men gert he be And bade thaim bid quhill thai thar tyme mycht Se: “?e want wapynnys and harnes in this tid; The fyrst cowntir ?e may nocht weill abid”. Wallace gert sone the chyftaynis till him call. This charge he gaiff, for chance that mycht befall: “Till tak no heid to ger nor off pylage, For thai will fle as wod folk in a rage. Wyne fyrst the men, the gud syne ?e may haiff. Than tak na tent off cowatys to craiff. Throuch cowatys sum losis gud and lyff. I commaund ?ow forber sic in our stryff. Luk that ?e saiff na lord, capteyne nor knycht. For worschipe wyrk and for our eldris rycht. God blys ws that may we in sic wiage Put thir fals folk out off our heretage”. Than thai inclynd all with a gudly will; His playne commaund thai hecht for to fulfill. On the gret ost thir partice fast can draw. Cumand to thaim out off the south thai saw Thre hundreth men in-till thar armour cler, The gaynest way to thaim approchit ner. Wallace said sone thai war na Inglismen, “For by this ost the gatis weyll thai ken.” Thom Haliday, thai men he gydyt rycht; Off Anaddyrdaill he had thaim led that nycht, His twa gud sonnis, Ihonstoun and Rudyrfurd. Wallace was blyth fra he had hard thar wourd, So was the laiff off his gud chewalry. Jarden thar come in-till thar cumpany, And Kyrk-patrik, befor in Esdaill was. A weyng thai war in Wallace ost to pas. The Inglis wach, that nycht had beyne on steir, Drew to thar ost rycht as the day can per. Wallace knew weill, for he befor had seyne The kingis pal?on quhar it was buskit beyne. Than with ryth hors the Scottis befor thaim raid. The fyrst cowntir so gret abaysing maid That all the ost was stunyst off that sicht. Full mony ane derffly to ded was dicht, Feill off thaim was as than out off aray; The mair haiste and awfull was the fray. The noyis rouschit throuch strakis that thai dang, The rewmour rais so rudly thaim amang That all the ost was than in poynt to fle. The wys lordis fra thai the perell se, The fellone fray all rasyt wes about And how thar king stud in so mekill dout, Till his pal?one full mony thousand socht Him to reskew be ony way thai mocht. The Erll off Kent that nycht walkand had beyne With v thousand off men in armour cleyne; About the king full sodandly thai gang, And traistis weill the sail?e wes rycht strang. All Wallace folk in wys off wer was gud, In-to the stour syne lychtyt quhar thai stud. Quham euir thai hyt na harnes mycht thaim stynt Fra thai on fute semblit with suerdis dynt. Off manheid thai in hartis cruell was, Thai thocht to wyn or neuir thine to pas. Feill Inglismen befor the king thai slew. Schir Ihon the Grayme come with his power new. Amang the ost with the mydwart he raid. Gret martyrdome on Sotheroun men thai maid. The rerward than set on sa hardely, With Newbyggyn and all the chewalry. Pal?one rapys thai cuttyt in-to sowndyr, Borne to the ground and mony smoryt wndir. The fute-men come the quhilk I spak off ayr, On frayt folk set strakis sad and sayr. Thocht thai befor wantyt bath hors and ger, Anewch thai gat, quhat thai wald waill to wer. The Scottis power than all to-gyddir war. The kingis pal?on brymly doun thai bar. The Erll off Kent with a gud ax in hand In-to the stour full stoutly couth he stand, Befor the king makand full gret debait. Quha best did than he had the heast stait. The felloune stour so stalwart was and strang, Thar-to contened merwalusly and lang. Wallace him saw, full sadly couth persew And at a straik that cheiff chyftayne he slew. The Sotheron folk fled fast and durst nocht byd, Horssit thar king and off the feild couth ride, Agaynis his will, for he was laith to fle. In-to that tyme he rocht nocht for to de. Off his best men iiii thousand thar was dede Or he couth fynd to fle and leiff that stede. Twenty thousand with him fled in a staill. The Scottis gat hors and folowit that battaill. Throuch Cultir hope or tyme thai wan the hycht Feill Sotheroun folk was merryt in thar mycht, Slayne be the gait as thar king fled away. Bathe fair and brycht and rycht cler was the day, The sone ryssyn schynand our hill and daill. Than Wallace kest quhat was his grettest waill. The fleand folk that off the feild fyrst past In-to thar king agayne releiffit fast. Fra athir sid so mony semblit thar That Wallace wald lat folow thaim no mar; Befor he raid, gart his folk turn agayne. Off Inglismen vii thousand thar was slayne. Than Wallace ost agayne to Beggar raid Quhar Inglismen gret purwians had maid. The Iowalre as it was thiddir led, Pal?onnis and all, thai leiffit quhen thai fled. The Scottis gat gold, gud, ger and othir wage. Relewyt thai war at partit that pilage. To meit thai went with myrthis and plesance. Thai sparyt nocht king Eduuardis purweance. With solace syne a litill sleyp thai ta. A prewa wach he gert amang thaim ga. Twa kukis fell, thair lyffis for to saiff, With dede corssys that lay wnputt in graiff. Quhen thai saw weyll the Scottis war at rest Out off the feild to steill thaim thocht it best. Full law thai crap quhill thai war out off sicht, Eftir the ost syne rane in all thar mycht. Quhen that the Scottis had slepyt bot a quhill, Than rais thai wp, for Wallace dredyt gyll. He said to thaim, “The Sotherone may persewe Agayne to ws, for thai ar folk enew. Quhar Inglismen prowisioune makis in wer It is full hard to do thaim mekill der. On this playne feild we will thaim nocht abid. To sum gud strenth my purpos is to ryd.” The purweance that left was in that stede To Ropis bog he gert serwandis it lede, With ordinance at Sothroun brocht it thar. He with the ost to Dawis schaw can far And thar Ramaynede a gret space off the day. Off Inglismen ?eit sum thing will I say. As king Eduuart throuch Cultir hoppis socht, Quhen he persawit the Scottis folowed nocht, In Ihonnys greyne he gert the ost ly still. Feill fleand folk assemblit sone him till. Quhen thai war met the king ner worthit mad For his der kyn that he thar lossyt had. His twa Emys in-to the feild was slayne, His secund sone that mekill was off mayne. His brothir Hew was kelyt thar full cald. The Erll off Kent, that cruell berne and bald, With gret worschip tuk ded befor the king. For him he murnyt als lang as he mycht ryng. At this semlay as thai in sorow stand, The twa kukis come sone in at his hand And tald till him how thai enchapyt war: “The Scottis all as swyne lyis dronkyn thar Off our wicht wyne ?e gert ws thiddir led. Full weill we may be wengit off thar ded. A-payne our lywis it is suth that we tell. Raturne agayne, ?e sall fynd thaim ?our sell.” He blamyt thaim and said na witt it was That he agayne for sic a taill suld pas: “Thar chyftayne is rycht merwalus in wer. Fra sic perell he can full weill thaim ber. To sek him mar as now I will nocht ryd. Our meit is lost, tharfor we may nocht byd.” The hardy duk off Longcastell and lord, “Souerane,” he said, “till our consaill concord. Gyff this be trew ?e haiff the mar awaill. We may thaim wyne and mak bot licht trawaill. War ?on folk ded quha may agayne ws stand? Than neid we nocht for meit to leiff the land.” The king ansuerd, “I will nocht rid agayne. As at this tyme my purpos is in playne. The duk said, “Schir, gyff ?e contermyt be, To mowff ?ow mor It afferis nocht for me. Command power agayne with me to wend And I off this sall se a finaill end.” X thousand haill he chargyt for to ryd. “Her in this strenth all nycht I sall ?ow bid. We may get meit off bestiall in this land. Gud drynk as now we can nocht bryng to hand.” Off Westmorland the lord had mett him thar. On with the duk he graithit him to fair. At the fyrst straik with thaim he had nocht beyne. With him he led a thousand weill beseyne. A Pykart lord was with a thousand bowne. Off king Edward he kepyt Calys toun. This xii thousand on to the feild can fair. The ii captans sone mett thaim at Beggair With the haill stuff off Roxburch and Berweike. Schir Rawff Gray saw at thai war Sotheron leik; Out off the south approchit to thar sicht. He knew full weill with thaim it was nocht rycht. Amer Wallange with his power come als, King Eduuardis man, a tyrand knycht and fals. Quhen thai war mett thai fand nocht ellis thar Bot dede corsis, and thai war spul?eit bar. Than merueld thai quhar at the Scottis suld be; Off thaim about perance thai couth nocht se, Bot Spyis thaim tald, that come with schir Amar, In Dawis schaw thai saw thaim mak repar. The fers Sotheroun sone passit to that place. The wach wes war and tald it to Wallace. He warnd the ost out off that wood to ryd. In Roppis bog he purpost for to byd. A litill schaw wpon the ta syd was That men on fute mycht off the bog out pas. Thar hors thai left in-to that litill hauld; On fute thai thocht the mos that thai suld hauld. The Inglis ost had weill thar passage seyne And folowed fast with cruell men and keyne. Thai trowit that bog mycht mak thaim litill waill, Growyn our with reys and all the sward was haill. On thaim to ryd thai ordand in gret Ire. Off the formest a thousand in the myre Off hors with men was plungyt in the deipe. The Scottis men tuk off thar cummyng kepe, Apon thaim set with strakis sad and sar. ?eid Nane away off all that entrit thar. Lycht men on fute apon thaim derffly dang. Feill wndyr hors was smoryt in that thrang, Stampyt in mos and with rud hors ourgayne. The worthy Scottis the dry land than has tayne, Apon the laiff fechtand full wondyr fast, And mony groyme thai maid full sar agast. Than Inglismen, that besy was in wer, Assail?eit sar thaim fra the mos to ber On athir syd, bot than it was no but. The strenth thai held rycht awfully on fut, Till men and hors gaiff mony grewous wound. Feyll to the dede thai stekit in that stound. The Pykart lord assail?eit scharply thar Vpon the Grayme with strakis sad and sar. Schir Ihone the Grayme with a staff suerd off steill His brycht byrneis he persyt euirilkdeill, Throuch all the stuff, and stekit him in that sted. Thus off his dynt the bauld Pykart is ded. The Inglis ost tuk playne purpos to fle. In that turnyng the Scottis gert mony de. Wallace wald fayne at the Wallang haiff beyne. Off Westmorland the lord was thaim betweyne; Wallace on him he set ane awfull dynt, Throuch basnet stuff that na steill mycht it stynt. Derffly to dede he left him in that place. The fals knycht thus eschapit throuch this cace. And Robert Boid, has with a captayne mett Off Berweik, than a sad straik on him set Awkwart the crag and kerwyt the pissane, Throuch all his weid in sondyr straik the bane. Feill horssyt men fled fast and durst nocht byd. Raboytit ewill on to thar king thai rid. The duk him tald off all thar Iornay haill. His hart for Ire bolnyt for byttir baill. Haill he hecht he suld neuyr London se On Wallace deid quhill he Rawengit be, Or los his men agayne as he did ayr. Thus socht he south with gret sorou and cair, At the Byrkhill a litill tary maid, Syne throuch the land but rest our Sulway raid. The Scottis ost a nycht ramanyt still. Apon the morn thai spul?ete with gud will The dede corssis, syne couth to Braid wood fayr; At a consaill iii dayis soiornyt thar. At Forest kyrk a metyng ordand he. Thai chesd Wallace Scottis wardand to be, Traistand he suld thar paynfull sorow ces. He rasawyt all that wald cum till his pes. Schir Wil?ham come that lord off Douglas was, Forsuk Eduuard, at Wallace pes can ass. In thar thrillage he wald no langer be. Trewbut befor till Ingland payit he. In-contrar Scottis with thaim he neuir raid. Fer bettir cher Wallace tharfor him maid. Thus tretyt he and cheryst wondyr fair Trew Scottis men that fewte maid him thar, And gaiff gretly feill gudis at he wan. He warnd it nocht til na gud Scottis man. Quha wald rebell and gang contrar the rycht He punyst sar, war he squier or knycht. Thus merwalusly gud Wallas tuk on hand. Lykly he was, rycht fair and weill farrand, Mandly and stout and tharto rycht liberall, Plesand and wis in all gud gouernall. To sla forsuth Sotheroun he sparyt nocht. To Scottismen full gret profyt he wrocht. In-to the south sone efftir passit he; As him best thocht he rewllyt that contre. Schirrais he maid that cruell was to ken And captans als off wis trew Scottis men. Fra Gamlis peth the land obeyt him haill Til Vr wattir, bath strenth, forest and daill. Agaynis him in Galloway hous was nayne Except Wigtoun byggyt off lyme and stayne. That Captayne hard the reullis off Wallace; Away be sey he staw out off that place, Lewyt all waist and couth in Ingland wend. Bot Wallace sone a kepar till it send, A gud squier and to nayme he was cald Adam Gordone, as the storie me tald. A strenth thar was on the wattir off Cre, With-in a roch, rycht stalwart, wrocht off tre; A gait befor, mycht no man to It wyn But the consent off thaim that duelt with-In. On the bak sid a Roch and wattir was. A strait entre forsuth it was to pas. To wesy it Wallace him selff sone went. Fra he it saw he kest in his entent; To wyn that hauld he has chosyne a gait That thai with-in suld mak litill debait. His power haill he gert bid out off sicht, Bot iii with him, qwhill tyme that it was nycht. Than tuk he twa, quhen that the nycht was dym, Stewyn off Irland and Kerle that couth clyme, The wattir wndir, and clame the Roch so strang. Thus entir thai the Sothrone men amang. The wach befor tuk na tent to that syd. Thir iii in feyr sone to the port thai glid. Gud Wallace than straik the portar him sell; Dede our the Roch in-to the dik he fell; Leit doun the brig and blew his horne on hycht. The buschement brak and come in all thar mycht, At thar awne will sone entrit in that place. Till Inglismen thai did ful litill grace. Sexty thai slew; in that hauld was no ma Bot ane ald preist and sympill wemen twa. Gret purweance was in that Roch to spend. Wallace baid still quhill it was at ane end, Brak doune the strenth, bath bryg and bulwark all. Out our the Roch thai gert the temyr fall, Wndid the gait and wald no langar bid. In Carrik syne thai bownyt thaim to rid, Haistit thaim nocht bot sobyrly couth fair Till Towrnbery: that Captane was off Ayr With lord Persie, to tak his consaill haill. Wallace purpoisit that place for to assaill. Ane woman tauld quhen the capitane was gane. Gude men of fence into the steid was nane. Thay fillit the dyke with eird and tymmer haill, Syne fyrd the ?ett; na succour mycht awaill. A prest thar was and gentill wemen with-In Quhilk for the fyr maid hiddewis noyis and dyn. “Mercy,” thai cryit, “for him that deit on tre.” Wallace gert slaik the fyr and leit thaim be. To mak defens na ma was lewyt thar. He thaim commaund out off the land to far, Spul?eit the place and spilt all at thai mocht. Apon the morn in Cumno sone thai socht, To Laynrik syne and set a tyme off ayr. Mysdoaris feill he gert be punyst thar. To gud trew men he gaiff full mekill wage, His brothir sone put to his heretage; To the Blakcrag in Cumno past agayne, His houshauld set with men off mekill mayn. Thre monethis thar he duellyt in gud rest. Suttell Sotheroune fand weill it was the best Trewis to tak for till enchew a chans. To furthir this thai send for knycht Wallans. Bothwell ?eit that tratour kepyt still, And Ayr all haill was at the Perseis will. The byschope Beik in Glaskow duellyt thar Throucht gret supple of the captayne off Ayr. Erll off Stamffurd, was chanslar off Ingland, With schir Amar this trawaill tuk on hand, To procur pes be ony maner off cace. A saiff condyt thai purchest off Wallace. In Ruglen kyrk the tryst than haiff thai set, A promes maid to meit Wallace but let. The day of this approchit wondyr fast. The gret chanslar and Amar thiddir past, Syne Wallace come and his men weill beseyn, With him fyfty arayit all in greyne. Ilkane off thaim a bow and arrowis bar And lang suerdis the quhilk full sharply schar. In-to the kyrk he gert a preyst rawes, With humyll mynd rycht mekly hard a mes. Syn wp he rais and till ane alter went And his gud men full cruell off entent. In Ir he grew that traitour quhen he sawe. The Inglismen off his face stud gret aw. Witt reullyt him that he did no owtrage. The Erlle beheld fast till his hye curage, Forthocht sum-part that he come to that place, Gretlye abaysit for the vult off his face. Schir Amer said, “This spech ?e mon begyne. He will nocht bow to na part off your kyn. Sufferyt ?e ar, I trow ?he may spek weill. For all Ingland he will nocht brek adeyll His saiff cwndyt, or quhar he makis a band.” The chanslar than approfferit him his hand. Wallace stud still and couth na handis ta. Frendschipe to thaim na liknes wald he ma. Schir Amar said, “Wallace, ?he wndyrstand This is a lord and chanslar off Ingland. To salus him ?e may be propyr skill.” With schort awys he maid ansuer him till, “Sic salusyng I oys till Inglismen, Sa sall he haiff, quhar euir I may him ken At my power, that god I mak awow, Out off souerance gyff that I had him now! Bot for thi liff and all his land so braid I will nocht brek this promes that is maid. I had leuir at myn awn will haiff the With-out cundyt, that I mycht wrokyne be Off thi fals deid thou dois in this regioune, Than off pur gold a kingis gret ransoune. Bot for my band as now I will lat be. Chanslar, schaw furth quhat ?e desyr of me”. The chanslar said, “The most caus of this thing, To procur pees I am send fra our king With the great seill and woice off hys parliament. Quhat I bynd her oure barnage sall consent”. Wallace ansuerd, “Our litill mendis we haiff Syne off oure rycht ?e occupy the laiff. Quytcleyme our land and we sall nocht deny.” The chanslar said, “Off na sic charge haiff I. We will gyff gold or oure purpos suld faill.” Than Wallace said, “In waist is that trawaill. Be fauour gold we ask nayne off ?our kyn. In wer off ?ou we tak that we may wyn”. Abaissid he was to mak ansuer agayne. Wallace said, “Schir, we Iangill nocht in wayne. My consell gyffis, I will na fabill mak, As for a ?er a finaill pes to tak: Nocht for my selff that I bynd to ?our seill, I can nocht trow that euir ?he will be leill, Bot for pur folk, gretlye has beyne supprisyt, I will tak pees quhill forthir we be awisit.” Than band thai thus, thar suld be no debait, Castell and towne suld stand in that ilk stait Fra that day furth quhill a ?er war at end, Sellyt this pes and tuk thar leyff to wend. Wallace fra thine passit in-to the west, Maid playne repair quhar so him likit best. ?eit sar he dred or thai suld him dissaiff. This endentour to schir Ranald he gaiff, His der wncle, quhar it mycht kepit be. In Cumno syne till his duellyng went he. BOOK VII In Feuer?her befell the sammyn cace, That Inglismen tuk trewis with Wallace. This passyt our till Marche till end was socht. The Inglismen kest all the wayis thai mocht, With suttelte and wykkit illusione The worthi Scottis to put to confusione. In Aperill the king off Ingland come In Cvmyrland, of Pumfrat, fro his home. In-to Carleill till a consell he ?eid, Quhar-off the Scottis mycht haiff full mekill dreid. Mony Captane that was off Ingland born Thidder thai past and semblit thar king beforn. Na Scottis man to that consell thai cald Bot schir Amer that traytour was off ald. At him thai sperd how thai suld tak on hand The rychtwys blud to scour out off Scotland. Schir Amer said, “Thar chyftayne can weill do, Rycht wys in wer and has gret power to, And now this trew gyffis thaim sic hardyment That to ?our faith thai will nocht all consent; Bot wald ?e do rycht as I wald ?ow ler, This pes to thaim it suld be sald full der”. Than demyt he the fals Sotheroun amang How thai best mycht the Scottis barownis hang. For gret bernys that tyme stud in-till Ayr, Wrocht for the king quhen his lugyng wes thar, Byggyt about that no man entir mycht Bot ane at anys nor haiff off othir sicht, Thar ordand thai thir lordis suld be slayne, A Iustice maid quhilk wes off mekill mayne. To lord Persye off this mater thai laid. With sad awys agayne to thaim he said, “Thai men to me has kepit treuth so lang Desaitfully I may nocht se thaim hang. I am thar fa and warn thaim will I nocht. Sa I be quytt I rek nocht quhat ?he wrocht. Fra thine I will and towart Glaskow draw With our byschope to her off his new law”. Than chesyt thai a Iustice fers and fell Quhilk Arnwlff hecht, as my auctour will tell, Off South Hantoun, that huge hie her and lord. He wndirtuk to pyne thaim with the cord. Ane othir ayr in Glaskow ordand thai For Cliddisdaill men to stand that sammyn day; Syne chargyt thaim in all wayis ernystfully Be no kyn meyne Wallace suld nocht chaip by, For weill thai wyst and thai men war ourthrawin Thai mycht at will bruk Scotland as thar awin. This band thai clois wndir thar seillis fast. Syne south our mur agayn king Edward past. The new Iustice rasawit was in Ayr. The lord Persye can on to Glaskow fayr. This ayr was set In Iun the auchtand day And playnly criyt na fre man war away. The Scottis merweld, and pes tane in the land, Quhy Inglismen sic maistre tuk on hand. Schir Ranald set a day befor this ayr; At Monktoun kyrk his freyndis mett him thar. Wil?ham Wallace on to that tryst couth pas, For he as than wardane off Scotland was. This maister Ihone, a worthi clerk, was thar. He chargyt his kyne for to byd fra that ayr; Rycht weyll he wyst, fra Persey fled that land Gret perell was till Scottis apperand. Wallace fra thaim in to the kyrk he ?eid. Pater noster, Aue he said and Creid, Syne to the grece he lenyt him sobyrly. Apon a sleip he slaid full sodandly. Kneland folowed and saw him fallyn on sleip. He maid na noyis bot wysly couth him kepe. In that slummir cummand him thocht he saw Ane agit man, fast towart him couth draw. Sone be the hand he hynt him haistele. “I am,” he said, “in wiage chargit with the”; A suerd him gaiff off burly burnist steill. “Gud sone,” he said, “this brand thou sall bruk weill.” Off topaston him thocht the plumat was, Baith hilt and hand all gliterand lik the glas. “Der sone,” he said, “we tary her to lang. Thow sall go se quhar wrocht is mekill wrang.” Than he him led till a montane on hycht. The warld him thocht he mycht se with a sicht. He left him thar, syne sone fra him he went. Tharoff Wallace studiit in his entent. Till se him mar he had full gret desyr. Tharwith he saw begyne a felloune fyr Quhilk braithly brynt on breid throu all the land, Scotland atour fra Ros to Sulway sand. Than sone till him descendyt thar a qweyne, Inlumyt lycht, schynand full brycht and scheyne. In hyr presens apperyt so mekill lycht At all the fyr scho put out off his sicht; Gaiff him a wand of colour reid and greyne, With a saffyr sanyt his face and eyne. “Welcum”, scho said. “I cheis the as my luff. Thow art grantyt be the gret god abuff Till help pepill that sufferis mekill wrang. With the as now I may nocht tary lang. Thou sall return to thi awne oys agayne. Thi derrast kyne ar her in mekill payne. This rycht regioun thow mon redeme it all. Thi last reward in erd sall be bot small. Let nocht tharfor tak redres off this mys, To thi reward thou sall haiff lestand blys”. Off hir rycht hand scho betaucht him a buk. Humylly thus hyr leyff full sone scho tuk, On to the cloud ascendyt off his sycht. Wallace brak vp the buk in all his mycht. In iii partis the buk weill writyn was. The fyrst writtyng was gross letter off bras, The secound gold, the thrid was siluir scheyne. Wallace merueld quhat this writyng suld meyne. To rede the buk he besyet him so fast, His spreit agayne to walkand mynd is past, And wp he rays, syne sowdandly furth went. This clerk he fand and tald him his entent Off this wisioun, as I haiff said befor, Completly throuch. Quhat nedis wordis mor? “Der sone”, he said, “my witt vnabill is To runsik sic for dreid I say off mys. ?eit I sall deyme, thocht my cunnyng be small. God grant na charge efftir my wordis fall. Saynct Androw was, gaiff the that suerd in hand. Off Sanctis he is wowar off Scotland. That montayne is, quhar he the had on hycht, Knawlage to haiff off wrang that thow mon rycht.

Lykly it is be the brychtnes scho brocht, Modyr off him that all this warld has wrocht. The party wand, I trow be myn entent, Assignes rewlle and cruell Iugëment. The red colour, quha graithly wndirstud, Betaknes all to gret battaill and blud; The greyn, curage that thou art now amang. In strowbill wer thou sall conteyne full lang.

Dreid nocht tharfor, be out off all dispayr. Forthir as now her-off I can no mair”. He thankit hym and thus his leyff has tayne, Till Corsbe syne with his wncle raid hayme. With myrthis thus all nycht thai soiornyt thar. Apon the morn thai graith thaim to the ar And furth thai ryd quhill thai come to Kingace. With dreidfull hart thus sperit wicht Wallace At schir Ranald for the charter off pees. “Neuo”, he said, “thir wordis ar nocht les. It is lewyt at Corsbe in the kyst, Quhar thou it laid. Tharoff na othir wist”. Wallace ansuerd, “Had we it her to schaw! And thai be fals we suld nocht entir awe.”. “Der sone”, he said, “I pray the pas agayne. Thocht thou wald send, that trawaill war in wayne. Bot thou or I can nane it bryng this tid”. Gret grace it was maid him agayne to ryd. Wallace raturnd and tuk with him bot thre. Nane off thaim knew this endentour bot he. Wnhap him led, for bid him couth he nocht; Off fals dissayt this gud knycht had na thocht. Schir Ranald raid but restyng to the town, Wittand na thing off all this fals tresown. That wykked syng so rewled the planait, Saturn, was than in-till his heast stait; Aboun Iuno in his malancoly, Iupiter, Mars, ay cruell off Inwy Saturn as than awanyst his natur. Off terandry he power had and cur, Rebell renkis in mony seir regioun, Trubbill weddyr makes schippis to droun. His drychyn is with Pluto, in the se As off the land full off Iniquite. He waknys wer, waxing off pestilence, Fallyng off wallis with cruell wiolence. Pusoun is ryff amang thir othir thingis, Sodeyn slauchter off Emperouris and kingis. Quhen Sampsone powed to grond the gret piller Saturn was than in-till the heast sper. At Thebes als off his power thai tell, Quhen Phiorax sank throuch the erd till hell; Off the Troians he had full mekill cur Quhen Achilles at Troy slew gud Ectur; Burdeous schent and mony citeis mo. His power ?eit it has na hap to ho. In braid Brytane feill wengeance has beyne seyne. Off this and mar ?e wait weill quhat I meyn. Bot to this hous that stalwart wes and strang Schir Ranald come and mycht nocht tary lang. A bauk was knyt all full of rapys keyne. Sic a towboth sen syne wes neuir seyne.

A rynnand cord thai slewyt our his hed Hard to the bauk and hangyt him to ded. Schyr Brys the Blayr next with hys Eyme in past. On to the ded thai haistyt him full fast. Be he entrit his hed was in the swar, Tytt to the bawk, hangyt to ded rycht thar. The thrid entrit, that pete was for-thy, A gentill knycht, schir Neill of Mungumry, And othir feill off landit men about. Mony ?eid in bot na Scottis com out. Off Wallace part thai putt to that derff deid; Mony Craufurd sa endyt in that steid. Off Carrik men Kennadys slew thai als, And kynd Cambellis that neuir had beyne fals. Thir rabellit nocht contrar thar richtwis croun. Sotheroun for-thi thaim putt to confusioun. Berklais, Boidis and Stuartis off gud kyn; Na Scot chapyt that tyme that entrit in. Vpon the bawk thai hangit mony par; Besid thaim ded in the nuk kest thaim thar. Sen the fyrst tyme that ony wer wes wrocht, To sic a dede so mony sic ?eid nocht Vpon a day, throuch curssit Saxons seid.

Thus xviii scor to that derff dede thai dycht Off barronis bald and mony worthi knycht. Quhen thai had slayne the worthiast that was thar, For waik peple thai wald na langar spar, In-till a garth kest thaim out off that sted As thai war born, dispul?eit bar and ded. Gud Robert Boid on till a tawern ?eid With xx?? men that douchty war in deid, Off Wallace hous, full cruell off entent. He gouernyt thaim quhen Wallace was absent. Kerle turnyt with his master agayne, Kneland and Byrd that mekill war off mayn. Stewyn off Irland went furth apon the streit. A trew woman full sone with him couth meit. He speryt at hir quhat hapnyt in the ayr. “Sorou”, scho said, “is nothing ellis thar”. Ferdly scho ast, “Allace, quhar is Wallace?” “Fra ws agayne he passit at Kingace”. “Go warn his folk and haist thaim off the toun. To kepe him selff I sall be reddy boun”. With hir as than no mar tary he maid. Till his falowis he went with-outyn baid And to thaim tald off all this gret mysfair. To Laglane wood thai bownyt with-outyn mar. Be this Wallace wes cummand wondir fast; For his freyndis he was full sar agast. On to the bern sadly he couth persew Till entir in, for he na perell knew. This woman than apon him loud can call, “O fers Wallace, feill tempest is befall. Our men ar slayne that pete is to se, As bestiall houndis hangit our a tre. Our trew barrouns be twa and twa past In”. Wallace wepyt for gret los off his kyne, That with wnes apon his hors he baid. Mair for to sper to this woman he raid. “Der nece”, he said, “the treuth giff thow can tell, Is my Eyme dede, or hou the cace befell?” “Out off ?on bern”, scho said, “I saw him born, Nakit, laid law on cald erd me beforn. His frosty mouth I kissit in that sted, Rycht now manlik, now bar and brocht to ded! And with a claith I couerit his licaym, For in his lyff he did neuir woman schayme. His systir sone thou art, worthi and wicht. Rawenge thar dede for goddis saik at thi mycht. Als I sall help as I am woman trew!” “Der wicht”, he said, “der god sen at thou knew Gud Robert Boid, quhar at thou can him se, Wil?ham Crawfurd als, giff he lyffand be, Adam Wallace, wald help me in this striff! I pray to god send me thaim all in liff. For Marys saik bid thaim sone cum to me. The Iustice Innys thow spy for cheryte And in quhat feir that thai thar lugyne mak. Son efftir that we will our purpos tak In-to Laglane, quhilk has my succour beyne. Adew merket and welcum woddis greyne!” Her-off as than till hir he spak no mair, His brydill turnyt and fra hir can he fair; Sic murnyng maid for his der-worthi kyn Him thocht for baill his breyst ner bryst in twyn. As he thus raid in gret angyr and teyne, Off Inglismen thar folowed him fyfteyn Wicht wallyt men, at towart him couth draw With a maser to tach him to the law. Wallace raturnd in greiff and matelent. With his suerd drawyn amang thaim sone he went. The myddyll off ane he mankit ner in twa, Ane othir thar apon the hed can ta. The thrid he straik and throuch the cost him claiff. The ferd to ground rycht derffly doun he draiff. The fyft he hit with gret Ire in that sted. With-out reskew dreidles he left thaim ded. Than his thre men had slayne the tothir v. Fra thaim the laiff eschapit in-to lyff, Fled to thar lord and tald him off this cas. To Laglane wode than ridis wicht Wallas. The Sotheroun said quhat ane that he hit rycht With-out mercye dredles to ded wes dycht. Merwell thai had sic strenth in ane suld be, Ane off thar men at ilk straik he gert de. Than demyt thai it suld be Wallace wicht. To thar langage maid ansuer ane ald knycht: “Forsuth”, he said, “be he chapyt this ayr All ?our new deid is eking off our cair”. The Iustice said, quhen thar sic murmur rais, “?he wald be ferd and thar come mony fais, That for a man me think ?ow lik to fle And wait nocht ?eit in deid gyff it be he! And thocht it be I cownt him bot full lycht. Quha bidis her ilk gentill man sall be knycht. I think to deill thar landis haill to-morn To ?ow about that ar off Ingland born”. The Sotheron drew to thar lugyng but mar. Four thousand haill that nycht was in-till Ayr. In gret bernys biggyt with-out the toun The Iustice lay with mony bald barroun. Than he gert cry about thai waynys wide Na Scottis born amang thaim thar suld bid. To the castell he wald nocht pas for eys Bot soiornd thar with thing that mycht him pleys. Gret purwians be se to thaim was brocht, With Irland ayle the mychteast couth be wrocht. Na wach wes set becaus thai had na dout Off Scottis men that leiffand was with-out. Lawberand in mynd thai had beyne all that day; Off ayle and wyne yneuch chosyne haiff thai, As bestly folk tuk off thaim selff no keip. In thar brawnys sone slaid the sleuthfull sleip, Throuch full gluttre in swarff swappyt lik swyn. Thar chyftayne than was gret Bachus off wyn. This wys woman besy amang thaim was. Feill men scho warnd and gart to Laglayne pas, Hyr self formest, quhill thai with Wallace met. Sum comfort than in-till his mynd was set. Quhen he thaim saw he thankit god off mycht. Tithandis he ast. The woman tald him rycht: “Slepand as swyn ar all ?one fals men?he. Na Scottisman is in that cumpane”. Than Wallace said, “Giff thai all dronkyn be I call it best with fyr for thaim to se”. Off gud men than thre hundreth till him socht. The woman had tald iii trew burges, at brocht Out off the toun with nobill aile and breid And othir stuff, als mekill as thai mycht leid. Thai eit and drank, the Scottismen at mocht. The noblis than Iop has to Wallace brocht. Sadly he said, “Der freyndis, now ?e se Our kyn ar slayn tharoff is gret pete, Throuch feill murthyr, the gret dispite is mor. Now sum rameid I wald we set tharfor. Suppos that I was maid wardane to be Part ar away sic chargis put to me, And ?e ar her cummyn off als gud blud, Als rychtwis born be awentur and als gud, Als forthwart, fair and als likly off persoun, As euir was I; tharfor, till conclusioun, Latt ws cheys v off this gud cumpanye, Syne caflis cast quha sall our master be”. Wallace and Boid and Craufurd off renoun And Adam als than lord off Ricardtoun— His fadyr than wes wesyed with seknes; God had him tayne in-till his lestand grace— The fyft Awchinlek, in wer a nobill man, Caflis to cast about thir v began. It wald on him, for ocht thai cuth dewys, Continualy quhill thai had castyn thrys. Than Wallace rais and out a suerd can draw. He said, “I wow to the makar off aw And till Mary his modyr, wirgyne cler, My wnclis dede now sall be sauld full der, With mony ma off our der-worthi kyn. Fyrst or I eit or drynk we sall begyn, For sleuth nor sleip sall nayne remayne in me Off this tempest till I a wengeance se”. Than all Inclynd rycht humyll off accord And him resawit as chyftayne and thar lord. Wallace a lord he may be clepyt weyll, Thocht ruryk folk tharoff haff litill feill Na deyme na lord bot landis be thar part. Had he the warld and be wrachit off hart He is no lord as to the worthines. It can nocht be but fredome, lordlyknes. At the Roddis thai mak full mony ane Quhilk worthy ar, thocht landis haiff thai nane. This disscussyng I leiff herroldis till end. On my mater now brieffly will I wend. Wallace commaunde a burges for to get Fyne cawk eneuch, that his der nece mycht set On Ilk ?eit quhar Sotheroun wer on raw. Than xx?? men he gert fast wetheis thraw, Ilk man a pair, and on thar arme thaim threw. Than to the toune full fast thai cuth persew. The woman past befor thaim suttelly, Cawkit ilk ?ett that thai neid nocht gang by. Than festnyt thai with wetheis duris fast, To stapill and hesp with mony sekyr cast. Wallace gert Boid ner-hand the castell ga With fyfte men a Ieperte to ma. Gyff ony ischet, the fyr quhen that thai saw, Fast to the ?ett he ordand thaim to draw. The laiff with him about the bernys ?heid. This trew woman thaim seruit weill in deid With lynt and fyr that haistely kendill wald. In euir-ilk nuk thai festnyt blesis bald. Wallace commaund till all his men about, Na Sotheron man at thai suld lat brek out: “Quhat euir he be reskewis off that kyn Fra the rede fyr, him selff sall pas tharin”. The lemand low sone lanssyt apon hycht. “Forsuth”, he said, “this is a plessand sicht. Till our hartis it suld be sum radres. War thir away thar power war the les”. On-to the Justice him selff loud can caw: “Lat ws to-borch our men fra ?our fals law At leyffand ar, that chapyt fra ?our ayr. Deyll nocht thar land, the wnlaw is our sayr. Thou had no rycht. That sall be on the seyne”. The Rewmour rais with cairfull cry and keyne. The bryme fyr brynt rycht braithly apon loft. Till slepand men that walkning was nocht soft. The sycht with-out was awfull for to se. In all the warld na grettar payne mycht be Than thai with-in insufferit sor to duell, That euir was wrocht bot purgatory or hell: A payne off hell weill ner it mycht be cauld, Mad folk with fyr hampryt in mony hauld. Feill byggyns brynt that worthi war and wicht; Gat nane away, knaiff, Captane nor knycht. Quhen brundis fell off ruftreis thaim amang Sum rudly rais in byttir paynys strang; Sum nakyt brynt bot belches all away; Sum neuir rais bot smoryt quhar thai lay; Sum ruschit fast till ayr gyff thai mycht wyn. Blyndyt in fyr thar deidis war full dym. The reik mellyt with fylth off carioune Amang the fyr, rycht foull off offensioune. The peple beryt lyk wyld bestis in that tyd, Within the wallis rampand on athir sid, Rewmyd in reuth with mony grysly grayne. Sum grymly gret quhill thar lyff dayis war gayne. Sum durris socht the entre for to get, Bot Scottismen so wysly thaim beset, Gyff ony brak be awnter off that steid With suerdis sone bertnyt thai war to dede, Or ellys agayne beforce drewyn in the fyr. Thar chapyt nayne, bot brynt wp bayne and lyr. The stynk scalyt off ded bodyis sa wyde The Scottis abhord ner-hand thaim for to byd, ?eid to the wynd and leit thaim ewyn allayne Quhill the rede fyr had that fals blude ourgayne. A frer Drumlay, was priour than off Ayr, Sewyn scor with him that nycht tuk herbry thar In his Innys, for he mycht nocht thaim let.

Feill frekis thar thai freris dang to dede. Sum nakit fled and gat out off that sted, The wattir socht, abaissit out off slepe. In the furd weill that was bath wan and depe Feyll off thaim fell that brak out off that place, Dowkit to grounde and deit with-outyn grace. Drownyt and slayne was all that herbryt thar. Men callis it ?eit ‘the freris blyssyng off Ayr’. Few folk off waill was lewyt apon cace In the castell; lord Persye fra that place Befor the ayr fra thine to Glaskow drew. Off men and stuff it was to purwa new. ?eit thai with-in saw the fyr byrnand stout, With schort awis ischet and had no dout. The buschement than, as weryouris wys and wicht, Leit thaim allayne and to the hous past rycht. Boyd wan the port, entryt and all his men. Keparis in it was left bot ix or ten. The formast sone hym selff sesyt in hand, Maid quyt off hym, syne slew all at thai fand. Off purwyaunce in that castell was nayne. Schort tyme befor Persye was fra it gayne. The Erll Arnulff had rasawit that hauld, Quhilk in the toune was brynt to powder cauld. Boyd gert ramayn off his men xx?? still. Hym selff past furth to witt off Wallace will, Kepand the toun quhill nocht was lewyt mar Bot the wode fyr and beyldis brynt full bar. Off lykly men that born was in Ingland Be suerd and fyr that nycht deit v thousand. Quhen Wallace men was weill to-gydder met, “Gud freyndis”, he said, “?e knaw that thar wes set Sic law as this now in-to Glaskow toun Be byschope Beik and Persye off renoun. Tharfor I will in haist we thidder fair. Off our gud kyn sum-part ar lossyt thair”. He gert full sone the burges till him caw And gaiff commaund in generall to thaim aw, In kepyng thai suld tak the hous off Ayr: “And hald it haill quhill tyme that we her mayr. To byd our king castellys I wald we had. Cast we doun all we mycht be demyt our rad”. Thai gart meit cum for thai had fastyt lang. Litill he tuk, syne bownyt thaim to gang. Horsis thai cheys that Sotheroun had brocht thar, Anew at will, and off the toune can fair. Thre hundreth haill was in his cumpany. Richt wondir fast raid this gud chewalry To Glaskow bryg, that byggyt was off tre, Weyll passit our or Sotheroun mycht thaim se. Lorde Persye wyst, that besy wes in wer, Semblyt his men fell awfull in affer. Than demyt thai that it was wicht Wallace; He had befor chapyt throw mony cace. The byschope Beik and Persye that was wicht A thousand led off men in armys brycht. Wallace saw weill quhat nowmyr semblit thar. He maid his men In twa partis to fair, Graithit thaim weill with-out the townys end. He callit Awchinlek for he the passage kend. “Wncle”, he said, “be besy in-to wer. Quhethir will ?he the byschoppys taill wpber, Or pas befor and tak his benysone?” He ansuerd hym with rycht schort provision, “Wnbyschoppyt ?eit forsuth I trow ?e be. ?our selff sall fyrst his blyssyng tak for me, For sekyrly ?e seruit it best the nycht. To ber his taill we sall in all our mycht”. Wallace ansuerd, “Sen we mon sindry gang Perell thar is and ?e bid fra ws lang, For ?one ar men will nocht sone be agast. Fra tyme we meit for goddis saik haist ?ow fast. Our disseueryng I wald na Sotheroune saw. Behynd thaim cum and in the Northast Raw. Gud men off wer ar all Northummyrland”. Thai partand thus tuk othir be the hand. Awchinlek said, “We sall do at we may. We wald lik ill to byd oucht lang away. A boustous staill betwix ws sone mon be, Bot to the rycht allmychty god haiff E”. Adam Wallace and Awchinlek was boune, Sewyn scor with thaim on the baksid the toune. Rycht fast thai ?eid quhill thai war out off sycht. The tothir part arrayit thaim full rycht. Wallace and Boid the playne streyt wp can ga. Sotheroun merweld becaus thai saw na ma; Thar sen?he cryit vpon the Persys syde, With byschop Beik that bauldly durst abide. A sayr semlay was at that metyng seyne. As fyr on flynt it feyrryt thaim betweyne. The hardy Scottis rycht awfully thaim abaid, Brocht feill to grounde throuch weid that weill was maid, Perssyt plattis with poyntis stiff off steill, Befors off hand gert mony cruell kneill. The strang stour rais as reik vpon thaim fast, Or myst throuch sone vp to the clowdis past. To help thaim selff Ilkayne had mekill neid. The worthy Scottis stud in fellone dreid, ?eit forthwart ay thai pressit for to be And thai on thaim, gret wondyr was to se. The Perseis men in wer was oysit weill, Rycht fersly faucht and son?eit nocht a-deill. Adam Wallace and Awchinlek com In And partyt Sotheron rycht sodeynly in twyn, Raturnd to thaim as noble men in wer. The Scottis gat rowme and mony doun thai ber. The new cowntir assail?eit thaim sa fast, Throuch Inglismen maid sloppys at the last. Than Wallace selff in-to that felloune thrang With his gud swerd that hewy was and lang At Perseis face witht a gud will he bar. Bath bayne and brayne the forgyt steill throw schair. Four hundreth men quhen lord Persie was dede Out off the gait the byschop Beik thai lede, For than thaim thocht it was no tyme to bid, By the Frer kyrk till a wode fast besyd. In that forest forsuth thai taryit nocht, On fresch horsis to Bothwell sone thai socht. Wallace folowed with worthi men and wicht. Forfouchtyn thai war and trawald all the nycht, ?eit feill thai slew in-to the chace that day. The byschope selff and gud men gat away. Amar Wallang Reskewit him in that place. That knycht full oft did gret harme to Wallace. Wallace began off nycht x houris in Ayr, On day be ix in Glaskow semlyt thair. Be ane our nowne at Bothwell ?eit he was, Repreiffit Wallang or he wald forthir pas, Syne turnd agayne, as weyll witnes the buk, Till Dundaff raid and thar restyng he tuk, Tald gud schir Ihon off thir tithandis in Ayr. Gret mayne he maid he was nocht with him thar. Wallace soiornd in Dundaff at his will V dayis out, quhill tithandis come him till Out off the hycht quhar gud men was forlorn, For Bouchane rais, Adell, Menteth and Lorn. Apon Argyll a fellone wer thai mak. For Eduuardis saik thus can thai wndirtak. The knycht Cambell in Argyll than wes still With his gud men agayne king Eduuardis will And kepyt fre Lowchow his heretage, Bot Makfad?an than did him gret owtrage. This Makfad?an till Inglismen was suorn. Eduuard gaiff him bath Argill and Lorn. Fals Ihon off Lorn to that gyft can concord. In Ingland than he was new maid a lord. Thus falsly he gaiff our his heretage And tuk at London off Eduuard grettar wage. Dunkan off Lorn ?eit for the landis straiff Quhill Makfad?an our-set him with the laiff, Put him off force to gud Cambell the knycht, Quhilk in-to wer was wys, worthi and wicht. Thus Makfad?an was entrit in-to Scotland, And merwalusly that tyrand tuk on hand With his power, the quhilk I spak off ayr. Thai iiii lordschippis all semlyt till him thair. Xv thousand off curssyt folk in deid Off all gaddryn in ost he had to leid, And mony off thaim was out off Irland brocht. Barnys nor wyff thai peple sparyt nocht, Waistyt the land als fer as thai mycht ga. Thai bestly folk couth nocht bot byrn and sla. In-to Louchow he entryt sodeynly. The knycht Cambell maid gud defens forthi. Till Crage Vnyn with thre hundir he ?eid. That strenth he held for all his cruell deid, Syne brak the bryg that thai mycht nocht out pas Bot throuch a furd quhar narow passage was. Abandounly Cambell agayne thaim baid, Fast vpon Ave that was bathe depe and braid. Makfad?ane was apon the tothir sid And thar on force behuffit him for to byd, For at the furde he durst nocht entir out For gud Cambell mycht set him than in dout. Makfad?ane socht and a small passage fand; Had he lasar, thai mycht pas off that land Betuix a Roch and the gret wattir sid. Bot iiii in front na ma mycht gang nor rid. In-till Louchow wes bestis gret plente. A quhill he thocht thar with his ost to be And othir stuff that thai had with thaim brocht, Bot all his crafft awail?eit him rycht nocht. Dunkane off Lorn has seyne the sodeyne cace. Fra gud Cambell he went to seik Wallace, Sum help to get off thar turment and teyne. To-gydder befor in Dunde thai had beyne, Lerand at scule in-to thar tendyr age. He thocht to slaik Makfad?anys hie curage. Gylmychell than with Dunkan furth him dycht; A gyd he was and fute man wondyr wicht. Sone can thai witt quhar Wallace lugyt was. With thar complaynt till his presence thai pas. Erll Malcom als, the Lennox held at es, With his gud men to Wallace can he pres. Till him thar come gud Rychard off Lundy; In-till Dundaff he wald no langar ly. Schir Ihon the Graym als bownyt him to ryd. Makfad?anis wer so grewit thaim that tid At Wallace thocht his gret power to se, In quhat aray he reullyt that cuntre. The Rukbe than he kepit with gret wrang Stirlyng castell that stalwart wes and strang. Quhen Wallace come be-sowth it in a waill Till erll Malcome he said he wald assaill. In diuers partis he gert seuir thar men, Off thar power that Sotheroun suld nocht ken. Erll Malcome baid in buschement out off sicht. Wallace with him tuk gud schir Ihone the knycht And a hundreth off wys wer-men but dout, Throuch Stirlyng raid gyff ony wald ysche out. Towart the bryg the gaynest way thai pas. Quhen Rukbe saw quhat at thar power was He tuk sewyn scor off gud archaris was thar. Wpon Wallace thai folowed wondyr sayr. At fell bykkyr thai did thaim mekill der. Wallace in hand gryppyt a nobill sper, Agayne raturnd and has the formast slayne. Schir Ihon the Grayme that mekill was off mayn Amang thaim raid with a gud sper in hand. The fyrst he slew that he befor him fand. Apon a nothir his sper in sowndyr ?eid. A suerd he drew quhilk helpyt him in neid. Ynglis archaris apon thaim can ranew, That his gud hors with arrowis sone thai slew. On fute he was; quhen Wallace has it seyne He lychtyt sone with men off armys keyne, Amang the Rout fechtand full wondyr fast. The Inglismen raturnyt at the last. At the castell thai wald haiff beyne full fayne, Bot erll Malcome with men off mekill mayne Betuix the Sotheroun and the ?ettis ?eid. Mony thai slew that douchty wes in deid. In the gret pres Wallace and Rukbe met, With his gud suerd a straik apon him set. Derffly to dede the ald Rukbe he draiff. His twa sonnys chapyt amang the laiff. In the castell be awentur thai ?eid With xx?? men; na ma chapyt that dreid. The Lennox men with thar gud lord at was, Fra the castell thai said thai wald nocht pas, For weill thai wyst it mycht nocht haldyn be On na lang tyme; forthi thus ordand he, Erll Malcom tuk the hous and kepyt that tyd. Wallace wald nocht fra his fyrst purpos bid. Instance he maid to this gud lord and wys, Fra thine to pas he suld on nakyn wys Quhill he had tane Stirlyng the castell strang. Trew men him tald thai mycht nocht hald it lang. Than Wallace thocht was maist on Makfad?ane; Off Scottis men he had slayne mony ane. Wallace awowide that he suld wrokyn be On that rebald or ellis tharfor to de. Off tyrandry king Eduuard thocht him gud. Law born he was and off law simpill blud. Thus Wallace was sar grewyt in his entent; To this Iornay rycht ernystfully he went. At Stirlyng bryg assemlyt till hym rycht Twa thowsand men that worthi war and wycht. Towart Argyll he bownyt him to ryd. Dunkan off Lorn was thar trew sekyr gid. Off ald Rukbe the quhilk we spak off ayr Twa sonnys on lyff in Stirlyng lewit thair. Quhen thai brethir consawit weill the rycht, This hous to hald that thai na langar mycht For caus quhi thai wantyt men and meit, With Erll Malcome thai kest thaim for to treit Grace off thar lyff and thai that with thaim was; Gaiff our the hous, syne couth in Ingland pas On the thrid day that Wallace fra thaim raid. With king Eduuard full mony ?er thai baid, In Brucis wer agayne come in Scotland. Stirlyng to kepe the tonne off thaim tuk on hand. Mencione off Bruce is oft in Wallace buk. To fend his rycht full mekill payne he tuk. Quhar-to suld I her-off tary ma? To Wallace furth now schortlye will I ga. Dunkan off Lorne Gilmychall fra thaim send A spy to be for he the contre kend. Be our party was passit Straith Fulan The small fute folk began to Irk Ilkane And hors off fors behuffyt for to faill. Than Wallace thocht that cumpany to waill. “Gud men,” he said, “this is nocht meit for ws; In brokyn ray and we cum on thaim thus We may tak scaith and harme our fayis bot small. To thaim in-lik we may nocht semble all. Tary we lang a playne feild thai will get. Apon thaim sone sa weill we may nocht set. Part we mon leiff ws folowand for to be.

To schir Ihon Grayme als mony ordand he And v hundreth to Rychard off Lundy. In that part was Wallace off Ricardtoun. In all gud deid he was ay redy boun. V hundreth left that mycht nocht with thaim ga, Suppos at thai to byd was wondyr wa. Thus Wallace ost began to tak the hicht, Our a montayne sone passit off thar sicht. In Glendowchar thair spy mett thaim agayn, With lord Cambell; than was our folk rycht fayn. At that metyng gret blithnes mycht be seyn. Thre hundreth he led that cruell was and keyn. He comford thaim and bad thaim haiff no dreid: “?on bestly folk wantis wapynnys and weid. Swne thai will fle, scharply and we persew.” Be Louchdouchyr full sodeynly thaim drew. Than Wallace said, “A lyff all sall we ta, For her is nayne will fra his falow ga.” The spy he send the entre for to se. Apon the mos a scurrour sone fand he. To scour the land Makfad?ane had him send. Out off Cragmor that day he thocht to wend. Gylmychall fast apon him folowed thar; With a gud suerd that weill and scharply schar Maid quyt off him, at tithandis tald he nayne. The out spy thus was lost fra Makfad?hane. Than Wallace ost apon thar fute thai lycht. Thar hors thai left thocht thai war neuir so wicht, For mos and crag thai mycht no langar dre. Than Wallace said, “Quha gangis best lat se.” Throuch-out the mos delyuerly thai ?eid, Syne tuk the hals, quharoff thai had most dreid. Endlang the schoir ay iiii in frownt thai past Quhill thai with-in assemblit at the last. Lord Cambell said, “We haiff chewyst this hauld. I trow to god thar wakyning sall be cauld. Her is na gait to fle ?one peple can Bot Rochis heich and wattir depe and wan.” Xviii hundreth off douchty men in deid, On the gret ost but mar process thai ?eid Fechtand in frownt and mekill maistry maid; On the frayt folk buskyt with outyn baid. Rudly till ray thai ruschit thaim agayne. Gret part off thaim wes men off mekill mayne. Gud Wallace men sa stowtly can thaim ster The battaill on bak v akyr breid thai ber. In-to the stour feill tyrandis gert thai kneill. Wallace in hand had a gud staff off steyll; Quhom euir he hyt to ground brymly thaim bar, Romde him about a largë rude and mar. Schir Iohn the Grayme in deid was rycht worthy, Gud Cambell als and Rychard off Lundy, Adam Wallace and Robert Boid in feyr Amang thar fais quhar deidis was sald full der. The felloun stour was awfull for to se. Makfad?ane than so gret debait maid he With Yrage men hardy and curageous; The stalwart stryff rycht hard and peralous, Boundance of blud fra woundis wid and wan, Stekit to deid on ground lay mony man. The fersast thar ynewch off fechtyn fand. Twa houris large in-to the stour thai stand, At Iop him selff weill wyst nocht quha suld wyn. Bot Wallace men wald nocht in sowndyr twyn. Till help thaim selff thai war off hardy will. Off Yrage blud full hardely thai spill, With feyll fechtyn maid sloppys throuch the thrang. On the fals part our wicht wer-men sa dang That thai to byd mycht haiff no langar mycht. The Irland folk than maid thaim for the flycht, In craggis clam and sum in wattir flett, Twa thousand thar drownyt with-outyn lett. Born Scottis men baid still in-to the feild, Kest wappynnys thaim fra and on thar kneis kneild. With petous woice thai criyt apon Wallace For goddis saik to tak thaim in his grace. Grewyt he was bot rewth off thaim he had, Rasauit thaim fair with contenance full sad. “Off our awne blud we suld haiff gret pete Luk ?he sla nane off Scottis will ?oldyn be. Off outland men lat nane chaip with the liff.” Makfad?ane fled for all his felloun stryff. On till a cave with-in a clyfft off stayne Wndyr Cragmor with xv is he gayne. Dunkan off Lorn his leyff at Wallace ast; On Makfad?ane with worthi men he past. He grantyt him to put thaim all to ded. Thai left nane quyk, syne brocht Wallace his hed, Apon a sper throuch-out the feild it bar. The lord Cambell syne hynt it by the har; Heich in Cragmor he maid it for to stand, Steild on a stayne for honour off Irland. The blessit men that was off Scotland born, Fwnde at his faith, Wallace gert thaim be sworn, Restorit thaim to thar landis but les. He leit sla nayne that wald cum till his pes. Efftir this deid In Lorn syne couth he fayr, Reullyt the land had beyne In mekill cayr. In Archatan a consell he gert cry, Quhar mony man socht till his sen?ory. All Lorn he gaiff till Duncan at was wicht And bad him: “Hald in Scotland with the rycht And thow sall weill bruk this in heretage. Thi brothir sone at London has grettar wage, ?eit will he cum he sall his landis haiff. I wald tyne nayne that rychtwisnes mycht saiff.” Mony trew Scot to Wallace couth persew. At Archatan fra feill strenthis thai drew. A gud knycht come and with him men sexte. He had beyne oft in mony strang Ieperte With Inglismen and son?eid nocht a-deill. Ay fra thar faith he fendyt him full weill, Kepyt him fre, thocht king Eduuard had sworn; Schir Ihon Ramsay, that Rychtwys ayr was born, Off Ouchterhous and othir landis was lord, And schirreff als as my buk will record, Off nobill blud and als haill ancrase Contenyt weill with worthi chewalre. In-till Straithern that lang tyme he had beyne At gret debait agaynys his Enemys keyne, Rycht wichtly wan his lewing in-to wer. Till him and his Sotheroun did mekill der. Weill he eschewit and sufferyt gret distress. His sone was cald the flour of courtlyness, As witnes weill in-to the schort tretty Eftir the Bruce, quha redis in that story. He rewllit weill bathe in-to wer and pes. Alexander Ramsay to nayme he hecht but les. Quhen it wes wer till armes he him kest. Wndir the croun he wes ane off the best. In tyme off pees till courtlynes he ?eid. Bot to gentrice he tuk nayne othir heid. Quhat gentill man had nocht with Ramsay beyne Off courtlynes thai cownt him nocht a preyne. Fredome and treuth he had as men wald as. Sen he begane na bettyr squier was. Roxburch hauld he wan full manfully, Syne held it lang, quhill tratouris tresonably Causit his dede, I can nocht tell ?ow how. Off sic thingis I will ga by as now.

Off gud Alexander as now I spek no mar. His fadyr come as I tald off befor. Wallace off hym rycht full gud comford hais For weill he coud do harmyng till his fais. In wer he was rycht mekill for to prys, Besy and trew, bath sobyr, wicht and wys. A gud prelat als to Archatan socht. Off his lordschip as than he brukyt nocht. This worthi clerk, cummyn off hie lynage, Off Synclar blude, nocht xl ?er off age, Chosyne he was be the Papis consent, Off Dunkell lord him maid with gud entent; Bot Inglismen that Scotland gryppit all Off benyfice thai leit him bruk bot small.

Off thar nowmyr thai had nocht lost a man. On the fyft day thai wan till Archatan, Quhar Wallace baid with gud men mony ane. He welcummyt thaim apon a gudly wys And said thai war rycht mekill for to prys. All trew Scottis he honourit in-to wer, Gaiff that he wan, hym selff kepyt no ger. Quhen Wallace wald no langar soiorn thar, Fra Archatan throu-out the land thai far Towart Dunkell, with gud men off renoun. His maist thocht than was haill on Sanct Ihonstoun. He cald Ramsai, that gud knycht off gret waill, Sadly awysyt besocht him off consaill: “Off Saynct Ihonstoun now haiff I in remembrance. Thar I haiff beyne and lost men apon chance, Bot ay for ane we gert x off thaim de, And ?eit me think that is no mendis to me.

Schir Ihon Sewart saw weill the toun was tynt, Tuk him to flycht and wald no langar stynt; In a lycht barge and with him men sexte The water doun socht succour at Dunde. Wallace baid still quhill the ferd day at morn And left nane thar that war off Ingland born. Riches thai gat off gold and othir gud, Plenyst the toun agayne with Scottis blud. Rwan he left thar Capteyn for to be, In heretage gaiff him office to fee Off all Straithern, and schirreiff off the toun. Syne in the north gud Wallace maid him boun. In Abyrdeyn he gert a consaill cry, Trew Scottis men suld semble hastely. Till Cowper he raid to wesy that abbay. The Inglis abbot fra-thine was fled away. Bischop Synclar with-out langar abaid Met thaim at Glammys, syne furth with thaim he raid. In-till Breichyn thai lugyt all that nycht. Syne on the morn Wallace gert graith thaim rycht, Displayed on breid the baner off Scotland In gud aray with noble men at hand; Gert playnly cry that sawfte suld be nayne Off Sotheroun blud quhar thai mycht be ourtayn.

Sum lap, sum fell, sum floteryt in the se. Na Sotheroun on lyff was lewyt in that hauld And thaim with-in thai brynt in powdir cauld. Quhen this was done feill fell on kneis doun, At the byschop askit absolucioun. Than Wallace lewch, said, “I forgiff ?ow all. Ar ?e wer-men, rapentis for sa small? Thai rewid nocht ws in-to the toun off Ayr, Our trew barrowns quhen that thai hangit thar.” Till Abyrdeyn than haistely thai pas, Quhar Inglismen besyly flittand was.

The men on land thai bertynyt bayne and lyr. ?eid nane away bot preistis, wyffis and barnys. Maid thai debait thai chapyt nocht but harmys. In-to Bowchane Wallace maid him to ryd, Quhar lord Bewmound was ordand for to bid. Erll he was maid bot off schort tyme befor. He brukit nocht for all his bustous schor. Quhen he wyst weill that Wallace cummand was, He left the land and couth to Slanys pas And syne be schip in Ingland fled agayne. Wallace raid throw the north-land in-to playne. At Crummade feill Inglismen thai slew. The worthi Scottis till him thus couth persew; Raturnd agayne and come till Abirdeyn With his blith ost apon the Lammes ewyn; Stablyt the land as him thocht best suld be, Syne with ane ost he passit to Dunde, Gert set a sege about the castell strang. I leyff thaim thar and forthir we will gang. Schir Amar Wallang haistit him full fast, In-till Ingland with his haill houshald past. Bothwell he left, was Murrays heretage, And tuk him than bot till King Eduuardis wage, Thus his awne land forsuk for euirmar. Off Wallace deid gret tithandis tald he thar. Als Inglismen sair murnyt in thar mude, Had lossyt her bathe lyff, landis and gud. Eduuard as than couth nocht in Scotland fair, Bot Kercyingame that was his tresorair, With him a lord than Erll was off Waran, He chargyt thaim with nowmeris mony ane Rycht weill beseyn in Scotland for to ryd. At Stirlyng still he ordand thaim to bid Quhill he mycht cum with ordinance off Ingland. Scotland agayne he thocht to tak in hand. This ost past furth and had bot litill dreid. The Erle Patrik rasauit thaim at Tweid.

Agayne Wallace he prewit in mony pres, With Inglismen suppleit thaim at his mycht. Contrar Scotland thai wrocht full gret wnrycht. Thar mustir than was awfull for to se, Off fechtand men thousandis thai war sexte; To Stirlyng past or thai likit to bid. To Erll Malcome a sege thai laid that tid And thocht to kep the commaund off thar king, Bot gud Wallace wrocht for ane othir thing. Dunde he left and maid a gud chyftane With twa thousand to kepe that hous off Stayne, Off Angwis men and duellaris off Dunde. The sammyn nycht till Sanct Ihonstoun went he. Apon the morn till Schirreff mur he raid And thar a quhill in gud aray thai baid. Schir Ihon the Grayme and Ramsay that was wicht, He said to thaim, “This is my purpos rycht. Our mekill it is to proffer thaim battaill Apon a playne feild bot we haiff sum awaill.” Schir Ihon the Grayme said, “We haiff wndirtayn With les power sic thing that weill is gayn.” Than Wallace said, “Quhar sic thing cummys off neid We suld thank god that makis ws for to speid, Bot ner the bryg my purpos is to be And wyrk for thaim sum suttell ieperte.” Ramsay ansuerd, “The brig we may kepe weill. Off way about Sotheroun has litill feill.” Wallace sent Iop the battaill for to set, The Twysday next to fecht with-outyn let. On Setterday on to the bryg thai raid, Off gud playne burd was weill and Iunctly maid; Gert wachis wait that nane suld fra thaim pas. A wricht he tuk, the suttellast at thar was, And ordand him to saw the burd in twa, Be the myd trest, that nayne mycht our it ga; On charnaill bandis nald it full fast and sone, Syne fyld with clay as na thing had beyne done. The tothir end he ordand for to be, How it suld stand on thre rowaris off tre, Quhen ane war out that the laiff doun suld fall. Him selff wndyr he ordand thar-with-all, Bownd on the trest, in a Creddill to sit, To lous the pyne quhen Wallace leit him witt Bot with a horn quhen it was tyme to be. In all the ost suld no man blaw bot he. The day approchit off the gret battaill. The Inglismen for power wald nocht faill. Ay sex thai war agayne ane off Wallace. Fyfty thousand maid thaim to battaill place. The Ramaynand baid at the castell still. Baithe feild and hous thai thocht to tak at will. The worthi Scottis apon the tothir side The playne feild tuk, on fute maid thaim to bid. Hew Kercyngayme the wantgard ledis he With xx?? thousand off likly men to se. Xxx?? thousand the Erll off Waran had, Bot he did than as the wysman him bad, All the fyrst ost befor him our was send. Sum Scottismen, that weill the maner kend, Bade Wallace blaw and said thai war enew. He haistyt nocht bot sadly couth persew Quhill Warans ost thik on the bryg he saw. Fra Iop the horn he hynt and couth it blaw Sa asprely and warned gud Ihon wricht. The Rowar out he straik with gret slycht. The laiff ?eid doun quhen the pynnys out gais. A hidwys cry amang the peple rais. Bathe hors and men in-to the wattir fell. The hardy Scottis that wald na langar duell Set on the laiff with strakis sad and sar. Off thaim thar-our as than souerit thai war. At the for-breist thai prewit hardely, Wallace and Grayme, Boid, Ramsay and Lundy, All in the stour, fast fechtand face to face. The Sotheron ost bak rerit off that place At thai fyrst tuk v akyr breid and mar. Wallace on fute a gret scharp sper he bar. Amang the thikest off the pres he gais. On Kercyngaym a strak chosyn he hais. In the byrnes that polyst was full brycht The pun?eand hed the plattis persyt rycht, Throuch the body stekit him but reskew. Derffly to dede that chyftane was adew. Baithe man and hors at that strak he bar doun. The Inglis ost, quhilk war in battaill boun, Comfort thai lost quhen thar chyftayne was slayn And mony ane to fle began in playne. ?eit worthi men baid still in-to the sted Quhill x thousand was brocht on-to thar dede. Than fled the laiff and mycht no langar bid. Succour thai socht on mony diuers sid, Sum est, sum west, and sum fled to the north. Vii thousand large at-anys flottryt in Forth, Plungyt in depe and drownd with-out mercye, Nayne left on lyff off all that feill men?he. Off Wallace ost na man was slayne off waill Bot Andrew Murray in-to that strang battaill. The south part than saw at thar men was tynt, Als fersly fled as fyr dois off the flynt. The place thai left, castell and Stirlyng toun, Towart Dunbar in gret haist maid thaim boun. Quhen Wallace ost had won that feild throuch mycht, Tuk wp the brig and loussit gud Ihon wricht, On the flearis syne folowed wondyr fast. Erll Malcom als out off the castell past With Lennox men to stuff the chace gud speid. Ay be the way thai gert feill Sotheroun bleid. In the Torwod thai gert full mony de. The Erll off Waran that can full fersly fle, With Corspatrik that graithly was his gyd, On changit hors throuch-out the land thai rid Strawcht to Dunbar, bot few with thaim thai led. Mony was slayne our sleuthfully at fled. The Scottis hors that had rown wondyr lang, Mony gaiff our that mycht no forthyr gang. Wallace and Grayme euir to-giddyr baid. At Hathyntoun full gret slauchtir thai maid Off Inglismen quhen thair hors tyryt had. Quhen Ramsay come gud Wallace was full glad. With him was Boid and Richard off Lundy, Thre thousand haill, was off gud chewalry; And Adam als Wallace off Ricardtoun, With Erll Malcome, thai fand at Hathyntoun. The Scottis men on slauchtir taryt was, Quhill to Dunbar the twa chyftanys coud pas Full sitfully for thar gret contrar cas. Wallace folowed till thai gat in that place. Off thar best men, and Karcyngaym off renoun, Twenti thousand was dede but redempcioun. Besyd Beltoun Wallace raturnd agayn. To folow mar as than was bot in wayn. In Hathyntoun lugyng thai maid that nycht, Apon the morn to Stirling passit rycht. Assumpcioun day off Marye fell this cas. Ay lowyt be our lady off hir grace! Conuoyar offt scho was to gud Wallace And helpyt him in mony syndry place. Wallace in haist, sone efftir this battaill, A gret aith tuk off all the barrons haill That with gud will wald cum till his presens. He hecht thaim als to bid at thar defens. Schir Ihon Menteth, was than off Aran lord, Till Wallace come and maid a playne record. With witnes thar be his ayth he him band Lauta to kep to Wallace and Scotland. Quha with fre will till rycht wald nocht apply Wallace with force pwnyst rygorusly, Part put to dede, part set in prysone strang. Gret word off him throuch bathe thir regions rang. Dunde thai gat sone be a schort trete, Bot for thar lywes thai fled away be se. Inglis capdans that hous had in-to hand Left castellis fre and fled out off the land. With-in ten dayis efftir this tyme was gayne Inglis captanys in Scotland left was nane, Except Berweik and Roxburch castell wicht. ?eit Wallace thocht to bryng thai to the rycht. That tyme thar was a worthi, trew barroun, To nayme he hecht gud Cristall off Cetoun. In Iedwort wod for saiffgard he had beyne. Agayne Sotheroun full weill he couth opteyn. In wtlaw oys he lewit thar but let. Eduuard couth nocht fra Scottis faith him get. Herbottell fled fra Iedwort castell wycht Towart Ingland, thar Cetoun met him rycht. With xl?? men Cristall in bargane baid Agayne viii scor and mekill mastre maid, Slew that captane and mony cruell man. Full gret ryches in that Iornay he wan, Houshald and gold as thai suld pas away, The quhilk befor thai kepit mony day. Iedwort thai tuk; ane Ruwan lewit he, At Wallace will captane off it to be. Bauld Cetoun syne to Lothiane maid repair. In this storye ?e ma her off him mair, And in-to Bruce quha likis for to rede; He was with him in mony cruell deid. Gud Wallace than full sadly can dewys To rewill the land with worthi men and wys. Captans he maid and schirreffis that was gud, Part off his kyn and off trew othir blud. His der cusyng in Edynburgh ordand he, The trew Crawfurd that ay was full worthe, Kepar off it with noble men at wage; In Mannuell than he had gud heretage. Scotland was fre that lang in baill had beyne, Throw Wallace won fra our fals enemys keyn. Gret gouernour in Scotland he couth ryng, Wayttand a tyme to get his rychtwis king Fra Inglismen, that held him in bandoun, Lang, wrangwysly, fra his awn rychtwis croun. BOOK VIII Fywe monethis thus Scotland stud in gud rest. A consell cryit, thaim thocht it wes the best In Sanct Ihonstoun at it suld haldyn be. Assemblit thar clerk, barown and bowrugie, Bot Corspatrik wald nocht cum at thar call, Baid in Dunbar and maid scorn at thaim all. Thai spak off him feill wordis in that parlyment. Than Wallace said: “Will ?e her-to consent, For-gyff him fre all thing that is bypast Sa he will cum and grant he has trespast, Fra this tyme furth kepe lawta till our croun?” Thai grant tharto, clerk, burges and barroun, With haill consent that writyng till him send. Richt lawly thus till him thai thaim commend, Besocht him fair as a peyr off the land To cum and tak sum gouernaill on hand. Lychtly he lowch, in scorn as it had beyn, And said he had sic message seyldyn seyne: “That Wallace now as gouernowr sall ryng, Her is gret faute off a gud prince or kyng. That king off Kyll I can nocht wndirstand. Off him I held neuir a fur off land. That bachiller trowis, for fortoun schawis hyr quhell Thar-with to lest. It sall nocht lang be weill. Bot to ?ow lordis, and ?e will wndirstand, I mak ?ow wys, I aw to mak na band. Als fre I am in this regioun to ryng Lord off myn awne, as euir was prince or king. In Ingland als gret part off land I haiff; Manrent tharoff thar will no man me craiff. Quhat will ?e mar? I warne ?ow I am fre. For ?our somoundis ?e get no mar off me.” Till Saynct Ihonstone this wryt he send agayne, Befor the lordis was manifest in playne. Quhen Wallace herd the erll sic ansuer mais A gret hate Ire throu curage than he tais; For weyll he wyst thar suld be bot a king Off this regioun at-anys for to ryng; A ‘king off Kyll’ for that he callyt Wallace. “Lordis,” he said, “this is ane wncouth cace. Be he sufferyt we haiff war than it was.” Thus rais he wp and maid him for to pas: “God has ws tholyt to do so for the laiff. In lyff or dede in faith him sall we haiff, Or ger him grant quhom he haldis for his lord, Or ellis war schaym in story to racord. I wow to god with eys he sall nocht be In-to this Realm bot ane off ws sall de, Les than he cum and knaw his rychtwis king! In this regioun weill bathe we sall nocht ryng. His lychtly scorn he sall rapent full sor, Bot power faill or I sall end tharfor, Sen in this erd is ordand me no rest. Now god be Iuge, the rycht he kennys best.” At that consaill langar he taryt nocht, With ii hundreth fra Sanct Ihonston he socht; To the consaill maid Insians or he ?eid, Thai suld conteyn and off him haiff no dreid: “I am bot ane and for gud caus I ga.” Towart Kyngorn the gaynest way thai ta. Apon the morn atour Forth south thai past. On his wyage thai haistit wondyr fast. Robert Lauder at Mussilburgh met Wallace. Fra Inglismen he kepyt weill his place; Couth nayne him trete, knycht, squier nor lord, With king Eduuard to be at ane accord. On Erll Patrik to pas he was full glaid; Sum said befor the Bas he wald haiff haid. Gude men come als with Crystell off Cetoun. Than Wallace was four hundreth off renoun. A squier Lyll, that weill that cuntre knew, With xx?? men to Wallace couth persew Besyd Lyntoun, and to thaim tald he than The Erll Patrik, with mony likly man, At Coburns peth he had his gaderyng maid And to Dunbar wald cum with-outyn baid. Than Lawder said, “It war the best think me Faster to pas, in Dunbar or he be.” Wallace ansuerd, “We may at laysar ryd. With ?on power he thinkis bargane to bid; And off a thing ?e sall weill wndirstand, A hardyar lord is nocht in-to Scotland. Mycht he be maid trew, stedfast, till a king, Be wit and force he can do mekill thing, Bot willfully he likis to tyne him sell.” Thus raid thai furth and wald na langar duell, Be est Dunbar, quhar men him tald on cas How erll Patrik was warnyt off Wallace, Ner Enerweik chesyt a feild at waill With ix hundreth off likly men to waill. Four hundreth was with Wallace in the rycht And sone onon approchit to thar sicht. Gret fawte thar was off gud trety betweyn To mak concord and that full sone was seyne. With-out rahers off accioun in that tid On athir part to-gydder fast thai rid. The stour was strang and wondyr peralous, Contenyt lang with dedis chewalrous. Mony thar deit off cruell Scottis blud. Off this trety the mater is nocht gud, Tharfor I ces to tell the destruccioun. Pete it was, and all off a nacioun. Bot erll Patrik the feild left at the last; Rycht few with him to Coburns peth thai past, Agrewit sar that his men thus were tynt. Wallace raturnd and wald no langar stynt Towart Dunbar, quhar suthfast men him tald Na purweance was left in-to that hald, Nor men off fens, all had beyne with thar lord. Quhen Wallace hard the sekyr trew record Dunbar he tuk all haill at his bandown, Gaiff it to kepe to Crystell off Cetoun, Quhilk stuffit it weill with men and gud wictall. Apon the morn Wallace, that wald nocht faill, With iii hundreth to Coburns peth he socht. Erll Patrik wschyt, for bid him wald he nocht. Sone to the park Wallace a range has set. Till Bonkill wood Corspatrik fled but let And out off it till Noram passit he. Quhen Wallace saw it mycht na bettir be Till Caudstreym went and lugit him on Tweid. Erll Patrik than in all haist can him speid And passit by or Wallace power rais, With-out restyng in Atrik forrest gais. Wallace folowed bot he wald nocht assaill. A rang to mak as than it mycht nocht waill; Our few he had, the strenth was thik and strang, Vii myill on breid and tharto twys so lang. In-till Gorkhelm Erll Patrik leiffit at rest. For mar power Wallace past in the west. Erll Patrik than him graithit hastelye, In Ingland past to get him thar supplye; Out throuch the land rycht ernystfully couth pas Till Anton Beik that lord of Durame was. Wallace him put out off Glaskow befor And slew Persye, thar malice was the mor. The byschope Beik gert sone gret power rys, Northummyrland apon ane awfull wys. Than ordand Bruce in Scotland for to pas To wyn his awne, bot ill dissauit he was; Thai gert him trow that Wallace was rabell And thocht to tak the kynryk to hym sel. Full fals thai war and euir ?eit has beyn. Lawta and trouth was ay in Wallace seyn; To fend the rycht all that he tuk on hand, And thocht to bryng the Bruce fre till his land. Off this mater as now I tary nocht. With strang power Sotheroun to-gidder socht, Fra Owys watter assemblit haill to Tweid. Thar land ost was xxx?? thousand in deid; Off Tynnys mouth send schippis be the se To kep Dunbar at nayne suld thaim supple. Erll Patrik with xx?? thousand but lett Befor Dunbar a stalwart sege he sett. The byschope Beik and Robert Bruce baid still With x thousand at Noram at thar will. Wallace be this, that fast was lauborand, In Lothyane com witht gud men v thowsand, Rycht weill beseyn, all in-to armys brycht, Thocht to reskew the Cetoun bauld and wicht. Undyr ?hester that fyrst nycht lugit he. Hay com till him with a gud chewalre. In Duns forest all that tyme he had beyne; The cummyng thar off Sotheroun he had seyne. L he had off besy men in wer. Thai tald Wallace off Patrikis gret affer. Hay said, “Forsuth and ?e mycht him our-set Power agayne rycht sone he mycht nocht get.

Rycht suth it is that anys we mon de. In-to the rycht quha suld in terrour be?” Erll Patrik than a messynger gert pas, Tald Anton Beik that Wallace cummand was. Off this tithingis the byschope was full glaid, Amendis off him full fayne he wald haiff haid. Bot mar prolong throuch Lammermur thai raid. Ner the Spot mur in buschement still he baid, As erll Patrik thaim ordand for to be. Wallace off Beik wnwarnyt than was he; ?eit he befor was nocht haisty in deid, Bot than he put bathe him and his in dreid. Apon swyft horsis scurrouris past betweyn. The cummyng than off Erll Patrik was seyn. The hous he left and to the mur is gayn. A playne feild thar with his ost he has tayn. Gud Cetoun syne wschet with few men?he, Part off his men in-till Dunbar left he, To Wallace raid, was on the rychtwys sid. In gud aray to the Spot mur thai ryd. Sum Scottis dred, the Erll sa mony was, Twenty thousand agayn sa few to pas. Quhen Iop persauit, he bad Wallace suld bid: “Tyne nocht thir men bot to sum strenth ?e ryd And I sall pas to get ?ow power mar. Thir are our gud thus lychtly for to war.” Than Wallace said, “In trewth I will nocht fle For iii off his ay ane quhill I may be.

Wallace knew weill that his men wald nocht fle For na power that leiffand was in lyff, Quhill thai in heill mycht ay be ane for fyfe. In that gret stryff mony was handlyt hate. The feill dyntis, the cruell hard debait, The fers steking, maid mony grewous wound, Apon the erd the blud did till abound. All Wallace ost in-till a cumpais baid; Quhar sa thai turnd full gret slauchtyr thai maid. Wallace and Grayme and Ramsay full worthi, The bauld Cetoun and Richard off Lundy, And Adam als Wallace off Ricardtoun, Bathe Hay and Lyll with gud men off renoun, Boyde, Bercla, Byrd and Lauder that was wycht, Feill Inglismen derffly to ded thai dycht. Bot erll Patrik full fersly faucht agayn. Throuch his awin hand he put mony to payn. Our men on him thrang forthwart in-to thra, Maide throuch his ost feill sloppis to and fra. The Inglismen began playnly to fle. Than byschope Beik full sodeynly thai se, And Robert Bruce contrar his natiff men. Wallace was wa fra tyme he couth him ken. Off Brucis deid he was agrewit far mar Than all the laiff that day at semblit thar. The gret buschement at anys brak on breid, X thousand haill that douchty war in deid. The flearis than with Erll Patrik relefd To fecht agayn, quhar mony war myscheifd. Quhen Wallace knew the buschement brokyn was, Out off the feild on hors thai thocht to pas, Bot he saw weill his ost sownd in thar weid. He thocht to fray the formast or thai ?eid. The new cummyn ost befor thaim semblit thar, On athir sid with strakis sad and sar. The worthi Scottis sa fersly faucht agayne Off Antonys men rycht mony haiff thai slayne; Bot that terand so wsit was in wer On Wallace ost thai did full mekill der, And the bauld Bruce so cruelly wrocht he Throuch strenth off hand feill Scottis he gert de. To resist Bruce Wallace him pressit fast, Bot Inglismen so thik betuixt thaim past; And Erll Patrik in all the haist he moucht Throuch-out the stour to Wallace sone he socht, On the the-pes a felloun strak him gaiff, Kerwit the plait with his scharp groundyn glaiff Throuch all the stuff and woundyt him sumdeill. Bot Wallace thocht he suld be wengit weill, Folowed on him and a straik etlyt fast. Than ane Mawthland rakless betwix thaim past. Apon the heid gud Wallace has him tane, Throuch hat and brawn in sondyr bryst the bane, Dede at that straik doun to the ground him drawe. Thus Wallace was disseuirit fra the lawe Off hys gud men, amang thaim him allane. About him socht feill Enemys mony ane; Stekit his hors, to ground behufid him lycht To fend him selff als wysly as he mycht.

About Wallace a largë rowme thai maid. The byschop Beik was braithly born till erd. At the reskew thar was a glamrous rerd. Or he gat wp full feill Sotheroun thai slew. Out off the pres Wallace thai couth raskew, Sone horsit him apon a coursour wicht, Towart a strenth ridis in all thar mycht, Rycht wysly fled, Reskewand mony man.

Thir v hundreth the quhilk I spak off ayr Sa awfully abawndownd thaim and sar Na folowar durst out fra his falow ga, The gud flearis sic raturnyng thai ma. Iiii thousand haill had tane the strenth befor Off Wallace ost, his comfort was the mor; Off Glaskadane that forrest thocht till hauld.

In Lammermur thai tranuntyt that tid, Thar lugyng tuk quhar him thocht maist awaill, For weyll he trowit the Scottis wald assaill Apon the feild quhar thai gaiff battaill last. The contre men to Wallace gaderyt fast. Off Edynburch wyth Crawfurd that was wicht Thre hundreth come in-till thar armour brycht, Till Wallace raid be his lugeyng was tayne. Fra Tawydaill come gud men mony ane Out off Iedwart with Ruwane at that tyd, To-giddyr socht fra mony diuers sid.

At the fyrst feild thire gud men had nocht beyn. Wallace wachis thair aduersouris had seyn, In-to quhat wis thai had thair lugeyng maid. Wallace bownyt eftir soupper but baid, In Lammermur thai passit hastely. Sone till aray ?heid this gud chewalry. Wallace thaim maid in twa partis to be. Schir Ihon the Graym and Cetoun ordand he, Lawder and Hay, with thre thousand to ryd; Hym selff the layff tuk wysly for to gid, With him Lundy, bathe Ramsay and Douglace, Berkla and Boid and Adam gud Wallace. Be this the day approchit wondyr neir And brycht Titan in presens can apper. The Scottis ostis sone semblit in-to sycht Off thar Enemys, that was nocht redy dycht.

For Wallace men was weill to-gyddyr met, On the South part sa aufully thai set In-contrar thaim the frayt folk mycht nocht stand. At-anys thar fled off Sotheroun v thousand. The worthi Scottis wrocht apon sic wys Iop said hym selff thai war mekill to prys. ?eit byschope Beik, that felloun tyrand strang, Baid in the stour rycht awfully and lang. A knycht Skelton that cruell was and keyn Befor him stud in-till his armour scheyn. To fend his lord full worthely he wrocht. Lundy him saw and sadly on him socht, With his gud suerd ane aukwart straik him gaiff, Throuch pesan stuff his crag in sondyr draiff, Quhar-off the layff astunyt in that sted. The bauld Skelton off Lundyis hand is dede. Than fled thai all and mycht no langar bid. Patrik and Beik away with Bruce thai ryd. V thousand held in-till a slop away Till Noram hous in all the haist thai may. Our men folowed, that worthi war and wicht. Mony flear derffly to dede thai dycht.

The Scottis at Tweid than hastyt thaim sa fast Feill Sotheroun men in-to wrang furdis past. Wallace raturnd, in Noram quhen thai war. For worthi Bruce his hart was wondyr sar; He had leuer haiff had him at his large, Fre till our croun, than off fyne gold to carge Mar than in Troy was fund at Grekis wan. Wallace than passit with mony aufull man On Patrikis land and waistit wondyr fast, Tuk out gudis and placis doun thai cast. His stedis vii that mete hamys was cauld, Wallace gert brek thai burly byggyngis bauld, Baithe in the Mers and als in Lothiane. Except Dunbar standand he lewit nane. Till Edynburgh apon the auchtand day, Apon the morn, Wallace with-out delay Till Pert he passit quhar the consell was set. To the barrowns he schawit with-outyn let How his gret wow rycht weill eschewyt was. Till a maister he gert Erll Patrik pas Becaus he said off Scotland he held nocht. Till king Eduuard to get supple he socht. The lordis war blyth and welcummyt weill Wallas, Thankand gret God off this fair happy chas. Wallace tuk state to gowern all Scotland. The barnage haill maid him ane oppyn band. Than delt he land till gud men him about, For Scotlandis rycht had set thar lyff in dout. Stantoun he gaiff to Lauder in his wage; The knycht Wallang aucht it in heretage. Than Birgeme cruk he gaiff Lyle that was wicht. Till Scrymgeour als full gud reward he dycht, Syne Wallace-toun and othir landis thar-till. To worthi men he delt with nobill will. Till his awne kyn heretage nayne gaiff he Bot office haill, at euerilk man mycht se For cowatice thar couth no wicht him blayme. He baid reward quhill the king suld cum hayme. Off all he dyd he thocht to bid the law Befor his king, master quhen he him saw. Scotland was blyth, in dolour had beyne lang. In Ilka part to gud laubour thai gang. Be this the tyme off October was past; Ner Nouember approchit wondyr fast. Tithandis than come, king Eduuard grewit was, With his power in Scotland thocht to pas, For Erll Patrik had gyffyn hym sic consaill. Wallace gat wit and semblit power haill. Xl thousand on Roslyn mur thar met. “Lordis,” he said, “thus is King Eduuard set In-contrar rycht to sek ws in our land. I hecht to god and to ?ow be my hand, I sall him meit for all his gret barnage With-in Ingland to fend our heretage. His fals desyr sall on him selff be seyn. He sall ws fynd in-contrar off his Eyn.

Quha ?eildis him sall neuir ransownd be.” The barrons than him ansuerd worthely And said thai wald pas with thar chewalry. Him selff and Iop prowidyt that men?he. Xx?? thousand off waillit men tuk he; Harnes and hors he gert amang thaim waill, Wapynnys enew at mycht thaim weill awaill, Grathyt thar men that cruell wes and keyn. Bettir in wer in warld coud nocht be seyn. He bad the laiff on laubour for to bid. In gud aray fra Roslyn mur thai ryd. At thar muster gud Wallace couth thaim as Quhat mysteryt ma in a power to pas: “All off a will, as I trow set ar we, In playne battaill can nocht weill scumfit be. Our rewme is pur, waistit be Sotheroun blud. Go wyn on thaim tresour and othir gud.” The ost Inclynd all in-till humyll will And said thai suld his commandment fulfill. The Erll Malcome with thir gud men is gayne, Bot nayme off rewill on him he wald tak nayne. Wallace him knew a lord and full worthi. At his consaill he wrocht full stedfastly. Starkar he was gyff thai suld battaill seyn, For he befor had in gud Iornays beyn. A man off strenth that has gud wit with-all A haill regioune may comfort at his call, As manly Ectour wrocht in-till his wer; Agayn a hundreth cowntyt was his sper, Bot that was nocht throuch his strenth anerly, Sic rewill he led off worthi chewalry. Thir ensampyllis war noble for to ken. Ectour I leiff and spek furth off our men. The knycht Cambell maid hime to that wiage, Off Louchow cheiff that was his heretage. The gud Ramsay furth to that Iornay went. Schir Ihone the Grayme forthwart in his entent, Wallace cusyng Adam, full worthi was, And Robert Boid, full blythly furth thai pas; Baith Awchynlek and Richard off Lundy, Lawder and Hay and Cetoun full worthy. This Ryall ost but restyng furth thai rid Till Browis feild and thar a quhill thai bid. Than Wallace tuk with him xl but les, Till Roxburgh ?ett raid sone or he wald ces. Sotheroun merueld giff it suld be Wallace, With-out souerance come to persew that place. Off Schyr Rawff Gray sone presence couth he as And warnd him thus forthwart he wald pas: “Our purpos is in Ingland for to ryd. No teyme we haiff off segyn now to bid. Tak tent and her off our cummyng agayne. Gyff our the hous, send me the keyis in playn. Thus I commaund befor this witnes large; Gyff thow will nocht, ramayne with all the charge. Bot this be done, throuch force and I tak the Out our the wall thow sall be hyngit hye.” With that he turnd and till his ost can wend. This Ilk commaund to Berweik sone he send With gud Ramsay that was a worthi knycht. The ost but mar full awfully he dycht, Began at Tweid and spard nocht at thai fand, Bot brynt befor throuch all Northummyrland. All Duram toun thai brynt wp in a gleid. Abbays thai spard and kyrkis quhar thai ?eid. To ?ork thai went but baid or thai wald blyn. To byrn and sla off thaim he had na syne. Na syn thai thocht, the sammyn thai leit ws feill, Bot Wil?am Wallace quyt our quarell weill. Fortrace thai wan and small castellis kest doun, With aspre wapynnys payit thar ransoune. Off presonaris thai likit nocht to kep. Quhom thai our-tuk thai maid thar freyndis to wepe. Thai sawft na Sotheroun for thar gret Riches; Off sic koffre he callit bot wretchitnes. On to the ?ettis and Faboris off the toun Braithly thai brynt and brak thar byggyngis doun; At the wallys assayed xv dayis, Till king Eduuard send to thaim in this wayis A knycht, a clerk and a squier of pes, And prayit him fayr off byrnyng for to ces, And hecht battaill or xl dayis war past, Souerance so lang gyff him likit till ast. And als he sperd quhy Wallace tuk on hand The felloun stryff in defens off Scotland, And said he merweld on his wyt for-thy, Agayn Inglande, was off so gret party: “Sen ?e haiff maid mekill off Scotland fre It war gret tym for to lat malice be.” Wallace has herd the message say thar will; With manly wytt rycht thus he said thaim till: “?he may knaw weill that rycht ynewch we haiff. Off his souerance I kepe nocht for to craiff. Becaus I am a natyff Scottis man It is my dett to do all that I can To fend our kynrik out off dangeryng. Till his desyr we will grant to sum thing. Our ost sall ces, for chans that may betid, Thir xl dayis bargane for till bid. We sall do nocht les than it mowe in ?ow. In his respyt my selff couth neuir trow.” King Eduuardis wrytt wndir his seill thai gaiff, Be fourty dayis that thai suld battaill haiff. Wallace thaim gaiff his credence off this thing. Thair leyff thai tuk, syne passit to the king And tauld him haill how Wallace leit thaim feill: “Off ?our souerance he rekis nocht adeill. Sic rewllyt men, sa awfull off affer, Ar nocht crystynyt than he ledis in wer.” The king ansuerd and said, “It suld be kend, It cummys off witt enemys to commend. Thai ar to dreid rycht gretly in certane. Sadly thai think off harmys thai haiff tane.” Leyff I thaim thus at consell with thar king And off the Scottis agayne to spek sum thing. Wallace tranountyt on the secund day. Fra ?ork thai passyt rycht in a gud aray. North-west thai past in battaill buskyt boun, Thar lugeyng tuk besyd Northallyrtoun And cryit his pes, thar merket for till stand Thai fourty dayis for pepill off Ingland, Quha that likyt ony wyctaill till sell. Off all thar fer was mekill for to tell. Schyr Rawff Rymunt, Captane off Maltoun was, With gret power ordand be nycht to pas On Wallace ost to mak sum Ieperte. Feyll Scottis men that duelt in that cuntre Wyst off this thing and gaderyt to Wallace. Thai maid him wys off all that suttell cace. Gud Lundy than till hym he callit thar And Hew the Hay, off Louchowort was ayr, With thre thousand that worthely had wrocht, Syne prewaly out fra the ost he socht. The men he tuk that come till hym off new Gydys to be, for thai the contre knew. The ost he maid in gud quyet to be. A space fra thaim he buschyt prewale. Schyr Rawff Rymunt with vii thousand com in On Wallace ost a Ieperte to begyn. The buschement brak or thai the ost come ner. On Sotheroun men the worthi Scottis thai ster; Thre thousand haill was braithly brocht to ground. Iornay thai socht and sekyrly has found. Schyr Rawff Rymunt was stekit on a sper, Thre thousand slayn that worthi war in wer. The Sotheroun wyst quhen thar chyftayn wes dede; To Maltoun fast thai fled and left that sted. Wallace folowed with his gud chewalry. Amang Sotheroun thai entrit sodeynly, Inglis and Scottis in-to the toun at anys. Sotheroun men schot and braithly kest doun stanys. Off thar awn men rycht feyll thair haiff thai slayn. The Scottis about that war off mekill mayn On grecis ran and cessyt all the toun. Derffly to dede the Sotheroun was dongyn doun. Gud Wallace thair has found full gret ryches, Jowellis and gold, bathe wapynnys and harnes; Spoul?eid the toun off wyn and off wictaill, Till his ost send with caryagis off gret waill. Thre dayis still with-in the toun thai baid, Syn brak doun werk that worthely was maid. Wyffis and childer thai put owt off the toun. Na man he sawft that was off that nacioun. Quhen Scottis had tane to turss at thar desyr Wallis thai brak, syn set the layff in fyr. The temir werk thai brynt wp all in playn; On the ferd day till his ost raid agayn; Gert cast a dyk that mycht sum strynthyng be To kepe the ost for sodeyn Ieperte. Than Inglismen was rycht gretly agast. Fra north and south in to thar king thai past, At Pomfray lay and held a parlement. To gyff battaill the lordis couth nocht consent Les Wallace war off Scotland crownyt king. Thar consaill fand it war a peralous thing, For thocht thai wan thai wan bot as thai war, And gyff thai tynt, Ingland for euirmar A-payn war put in-to the Scottis hand; And this decret thar wit amang thaim fand, Gyff Wallace wald apon him tak the croun To gyff battaill thai suld be redy boun. The sammyn message till him thai send agayn And thar entent thai tald him in-to playn. Wallace thaim chargyt his presens till absent, His consaill callyt and schawit thaim his entent. He and his men desyrit battaill till haiff Be ony wayis off Ingland our the laiff. He said, “Fyrst, it war a our hie thing, Agayne the faith to reyff my rychtwis king. I am his man, born natiff of Scotland. To wer the croun I will nocht tak on hand. To fend the rewm it is my dett be skill. Lat God abowe reward me as he will.” Sum bad Wallace apon him tak the croun. Wys men said, “Nay, it war bot derysioun To croun him king but woice off the parlyment”; For thai wyst nocht gyff Scotland wald consent. Othir-sum said it was the wrangwis place. Thus demyt thai on many diuers cace. This knycht Cambell, off witt a worthi man, As I said ayr was present with thaim than, Herd and ansuerd quhen mony said thar will: “This war the best, wald Wallace grant thar-till, To croun him king solemply for a day, To get ane end off all our lang delay.” The gud Erll Malcome said that Wallace mycht As for a day, in fens off Scotlandis rycht, Thocht he refusyt it lestandly to ber, Resawe the croun as in a fer off wer. The pepill all till him gaiff thar consent. Malcome off auld was lord off the parlyment. ?eit Wallace tholyt and leit thaim say thar will. Quhen thai had demyt be mony diuers skill In his awn mynd he abhorryt with this thing. The comouns cryit, “Mak Wallace crownyt king.” Than smylyt he and said it suld nocht be: “At termys schort, ?e get no mar for me. Wndyr colour we mon our ansuer mak, Bot sic a thing I will nocht on me tak. I suffer ?ow to say that it is sa. It war a scorn the croun on me to ta.” Thai wald nocht lat the message off Ingland Cum thaim amang or thai suld wndirstand. Twa knychtis passit to the message agayn, Maid thaim to trow Wallace was crownyt in playn, Gart thaim traist weill that this was suthfast thing. Delyuerit thus thai passit to thar king, To Pomfrait went and tald that thai had seyn Wallace crownyt, quharoff the lordis was teyn, In barrate wox in parlement quhar thai stud. Than said thai all, “Thir tithingis ar nocht gud. He did so weyll in-to thir tymys befor, And now thar king he will do mekill mor. A fortonyt man, no thing gois him agayn. To geyff battaill we sall it rew apayn.” And othir said, “And battaill will he haiff Or stroy our land. Na tresour may ws saiff. In his conquest, sen fyrst he coud begyn, He sellis nocht bot takis at he may wyn. For Inglismen he settis no doym bot ded. Price off pennys may mak ws no ramed.” Ane Wodstok said, “?he wyrk nocht as the wys, Gyff that ?e tak the awnter off supprice; For thocht we wyn that ar in-till Ingland The layff ar stark agaynys ws for to stand. Be Wallace saiff, othir thai cownt bot small. For-thi me think this war the best of all, To kepe our strynth off castell and wall toun. Swa sall we fend the fek off this regioun. Thocht north be brynt, bettir off sufferans be Than set all Ingland on a Ieperte.” Thai grantyt all as Wodstok can thaim say, And thus thai put the battaill on delay And kest thaim haill for othir gouernance, Agayn Wallace to wyrk sum ordinance. Thus Wallace has in playn discumfyt haill Agayn king Eduuard all his strang battaill; For throcht falsheid and thar subtilite Thai thocht he suld, for gret necessite And faute off fude, to steyll out off the land. And this decret thar wytt amang thaim fand: Thai gert the king cry all thar merket doun Fra Trent to Tweid off throchtfayr and fre toun; That in thai boundis na men suld wictaill leid, Sic stuff nor wyn, on na les payn bot deid. This Ilk decret thai gaiff in thar parlement. Off Scottis furth to spek is myn entent. Wallace lay still quhill xl dayis was gayn And fyve atour, bot perance saw he nayn Battaill till haiff, as thair promys was maid. He gert display agayne his baner braid, Repreiffyt Eduuard rycht gretlye off this thing, Bawchillyt his seyll, blew out on that fals king, As a tyrand turnd bak and tuk his gait. Than Wallace maid full mony byggyng hayt. Thai rayssyt fyr, brynt wp Northallyrtoun, Agayn throcht ?orkschyr bauldly maid thaim boun, Dystroyed the land als fer as euir thai rid. Sewyn myle about thai brynt on athir sid. Palyce thai spylt, gret towris can confound, Wrocht the Sotheroun mony werkand wound. Wedowis wepyt with sorow in thar sang. Madennys murnyt with gret menyng amang. Thai sparyt nocht bot wemen and the kyrk. Thir worthy Scottis off laubour wald nocht yrk. Abbayis gaiff thaim rycht largly to thar fud. Till all kyrk man thai did no thing bot gud. The temperall land thai spoul?eit at thar will. Gud gardens gay and orchartis gret thai spill. To ?ork thai went, thir wermen off renoun; A sege thai set rycht sadly to the toun. For gret defens thai garnest thaim within. A felloun salt with-out thai can begyn, Gert woid the ost in four partis about, With wachys feyll that no man suld wsche out. Abowne the toun apon the southpart sid Thar Wallace wald and gud Lundy abid. Erll Malcom syne at the west ?ett abaid, With him the Boid that gud Iornays had maid. The knycht Cambell, off Louchow that was lord, At the north ?ett, and Ramsay, maid thaim ford. Schyr Ihon the Graym that worthy was in wer, Awchinlek, Crawfurd, with full manlik affer At the est part bauldly thai bowne to bid. A thousand archaris apon the Scottis sid Disseueryt thaim amang the iiii party. Fyve thousand bowemen in the toun forthi With-in the wallis arayit thaim full rycht. Xii thousand and ma that sembly was to sycht. Than said Wallace, “War ?one apon a playn, In feild to fecht me think we suld be bayn.” Than sail?eit thai rycht fast on Ilka sid, The worthy Scottis that bauldly durst abid. With sper and scheild, for gownnys had thai nayn, With-in the dykys thai gert feill Sotheroun grayn. Arowys thai schot als fers as ony fyr Atour the wall, that flawmyt in gret Ire. Throuch byrneis brycht, with hedys fyn off steyll. The Sotheroun blud thai leyt no frendschip feyll; Our schefferand harnes schot the blud so scheyn. The Inglismen that cruell was and keyn Kepyt thar toun and fendyt thaim full fast. Fagaldys off fyr amang the ost thai cast. Wp pyk and ter on feyll sowys thai lent. Mony was hurt or thai fra wallys went. Stanys off spryngaldis thai cast out so fast And gaddys off Irne, maid mony goym agast. Bot neuir-the-les the Scottis that was with-out, The toun full oft thai set in-to gret dout, Thar bulwerkis brynt rycht brymly off the toun, Thar barmkyn wan and gret gerrettis kest doun. Thus sail?eit thai on Ilk sid with gret mycht. The day was gayn and cummyn was the nycht; The wery ost than drew thaim fra the toun, Set owt wachis, for restyng maid thaim boun, Wysche woundis with wyn off thaim that was wnsound. For nayn wes dede in gret myrth thai abound. Feyll men was hurt bot na murnyng thai maid, Confermyt the sege and stedfastly abaid. Quhen that the son on morow rais wp brycht, Befor the chyftanys semblyt thai full rycht And mendis thocht off the toun thai suld tak, For all the fens that the Sotheroun mycht mak. Arayit agayn as thai began a-for, About the toun thai sail?e wondyr sor, With felloun schot atour the wall so scheyn. Feill Inglismen that cruell was and keyn With schot was slayn for all thar targis strang. Byrstyt helmys, mony to erd thai dang. Brycht byrnand fyr thai kest till euirilk ?et. The entres thus in perall oft thai set. The defendouris, was off so fell defens, Kepyt thar toun with strenth and excellens. And thus the day thai dryff on to the nycht. To pal?ounnys bownyt mony wery wycht, All yrk off wer; the toun was strang to wyn, Off artail?e and nobill men with gyn. Quhen that thai trowyt the Scottis was all at rest For ieperte the Inglismen thaim kest. Schyr Ihon Nowrtoun, was knawyn worthy and wycht, Schyr Wil?ham off Leis, graithit thaim that nycht With v thowsand welle garnest and sawage. Apon the Scottis thai thocht to mak scrymmage, And at the ?et wschyt owt haistely On Erll Malcom and his gud chewalry. To chak the wache Wallace and x had beyn Rydand about and has thar cummyng seyn. He gert ane blaw, was in his cumpany. The redy men arayit thaim hastely. Feill off the Scottis ilk nycht in harnes baid Be ordinance, for thai sic rewll had maid. With schort awys to-gyddyr ar thai went Apon thair fais, quhar feill Sotheroun was schent. Wallace knew weill the Erll to haisty was, For-thi he sped him to the pres to pas. A suerd off wer in-till his hand he bar. The fyrst he hyt the crag in sondyr schar And othir awkwart apon the face tuk he, Wysar and frount bathe in the feild gert fle. The hardy Erll before his men furth past In-to the pres quhar feill war fechtand fast, A scherand suerd bar drawyn in his hand. The fyrst was fey that he befor him fand. Quhen Wallace and he was to-gidder set Thayr lestyt nayn agayn thaim that thai met, Bot othir dede or ellis fled thaim fray. Be this the ost all in a gud aray With the gret scry assemblit thaim about. Than stud the Sotheroun in a felloun dout. Wallace knew weill the Inglismen wald fle, For-thi he preyst in the thikkest to be, Hewand full fast on quhat sege that he socht. Agaynys hys dynt fyn steyll awail?eit nocht. Wallace off hand sen Arthour had na mak; Quhom he hyt rycht was ay dede off a strak. That was weyll knawin in mony place, and thar Quhom Wallace hyt he deryt the Scottis no mar. Als all his men did cruelly and weyll At com to strak—that mycht the Sotheroun feill! The Inglismen fled and left the feild playnly, The worthy Scottis wrocht so hardely. Schyr Ihon off Nourtoun in that place was dede And xii hundreth with-outyn ony ramede. Thir mony was left in-to the feild and slayn. The layff raturnyt in-to the toun agayn And rwyt full sar that euyr thai furth coud found. Amang thaim was full mony werkand wound. The ost agayn ilkane to thar ward raid, Comaundyt wachis and no mayr noyis maid, Bot restyt still quhill that the brycht day dew, Agayne began the toun to sail?e new. All thus thai wrocht with full gud worthines, Assail?eit sayr with witt and hardines. The ostis wictaill worth scant and fail?eit fast. Thus lay thai thair quhill diuers dayis war past. The land waistyt and meit was fer to wyn, Bot that wyst nocht the stuff that was within. Thai drede full sar for thar awn warnysoun. For souerance prayed the power off the toun; To spek with Wallace thai desyryt fast And he aperyt and speryt quhat thai ast. The mayr ansuerd, said, “We wald gyff Ransoun To pas ?our way and der no mayr the toun. Gret schaym it war that we suld ?oldyn be And townys haldyn off les power than we. ?he may nocht wyn ws, suthlie, thocht ?e bid. We sal gyff gold and ?he will fra ws rid. We may gyff battaill, durst we for our king; Sen he has left, it war ane our hie thing Till ws to do with-out his ordinance. This toun off him we hald in gouernance.” Wallace ansuerd, “Off your gold rek we nocht. It is for battaill that we hydder socht. We had leuir haiff battaill of Ingland, Than all the gold that gud king Arthour fand On the Mont Mychell, quhar he the gyand slew! Gold may be gayn bot worship is ay new. ?our king promyst that we suld battaill haiff. His wrytt tharto wndyr his seyll he gaiff. Letter nor band ?e se may nocht awaill. Ws for this toun he hecht to gyff battaill. Me think we suld on his men wengit be; Apon our kyn mony gret wrang wrocht he, His dewyllyk deid, he did in-to Scotland.” The mayr said, “Schyr, rycht thus we wndyrstand; We haiff no charge quhat our king gerris ws do, Bot in this kynd we sall be bundyn ?ow to, Sum-part off gold to gyff ?ou with gud will And nocht efftyr to wait ?ow with na Ill, Be no-kyn meyn, the power off this toun, Bot gyff our king mak him to battaill boun.” In-to the ost was mony worthi man, With Wallace ma than I now rekyn can. Bettir it was for at his will thai wrocht. Thocht he wes best no nothir lak we nocht. All seruit thank to Scotland euirmar For manheid, wit, the quhilk thai schawit thar. The haill consaill thus demyt thaim amang, The toun to sege thaim thocht it was to lang And nocht a-payn to wyn it be no slycht. The consaill fand it was the best thai mycht Sum gold to tak, gyff that thai get no mar, Syne furth thar way in thar wiage thai far. Than Wallace said, “My selff will nocht consent Bot gyff this toun mak ws this playne content: Tak our baner and set it on the wall, For thar power our rewme has ridyn all; ?oldyn to be quhen we lik thaim to tak, In-till Ingland residence gyff we mak.” This ansuer sone thai send in to the mair. Than thai consent, the Ramaynand that was thar, The baner wp and set it in the toun, To Scotland was hie honour and renoun. That baner thar was fra viii houris to none. Thar finance maid, delyuerit gold full sone. V thousand pund, all gud gold off Ingland, The ost rasawit with wictaill haboundand. Baith breid and wyne richt gladly furth thai gaiff And othir stuff at thai likit to haiff. Xx?? dais owt the ost Remaynit thar, Bot want of wictaill gert thaim fra it far; ?eit still off pees the ost lugyt all nycht Quhill on the morn the sone was ryssyn on hycht. In Aperill amang the schawis scheyn, Quhen the paithment was cled in tendyr greyn, Plesand war it till ony creatur In lusty lyff that tym for till endur. Thir gud wermen had fredome largëly, Bot fude was scant, thai mycht get nayn to by, Tursyt tentis and in the contre raid. On Inglismen full gret herschipe thai maid, Brynt and brak doun, byggyngis sparyt thai nocht, Rycht worthi wallis full law to ground thai brocht. All Mydlam land thai brynt wp in a fyr, Brak parkis doun, distroyit all the schyr. Wyld der thai slew for othir bestis was nayn. Thir wermen tuk off venysoune gud wayn. Towart the south thai turnyt at the last, Maid byggyngis bar als fer as euir thai past. The commons all to London ar thai went Befor the king and tald him thar entent, And said thai suld, bot he gert Wallace ces, Forsaik thair faith and tak thaim till his pes. Na herrald thar durst than to Wallace pas, Quharoff the king gretly agrewit was. Thus Eduuard left his pepill in-to baill. Contrar Wallace he wald nocht giff battaill Nor byd in feild, for nocht at thai mycht say, Gayff our the caus, to London past his way. At men off wit this questioun her I as, Amang noblis gyff euir ony that was, So lang throw force in Ingland lay on cas Sen Brudus deid, but battaill, bot Wallace. Gret Iulius, the Empyr had in hand, Twys off force he was put off Ingland. Wycht Arthour als off wer quhen that he prewit Twys thai fawcht, suppos thai war myschewit. Awfull Eduuard durst nocht Wallace abid In playn battaill, for all Ingland so wid. In London he lay and tuk him till his rest And brak his vow. Quhilk hald ye for the best? Rycht clayr it is to runsik this questioun. Deyme as ?e lest, gud men off discrecioun. To my sentence now breyffly will I pas. Quhen Wallace thus throw ?orkschyr Iowrnat was, Wictaill as than was nayne left in the land Bot in houssis quhar it mycht be warrand. The ost heroff abaissit was to bid. Fra fude scantyt na plesance was that tid. Sum baid ryd haym, sum baid ryd forthermar. Wallace callit Iop and said till him rycht thar, “Thow knawis the land, quhar most aboundance is. Be thow our gyd and than we sall nocht mys Wictaill to fynd, that wait I wondir weill. Thow has, I traist, off Ingland mekill feill. The kyng and his to stark strenthis ar gayn. Bot ieperte now perell haiff we nayn.” Than Iop said, “Schir, be ?e gydyt be me, The bowndandest part off Ingland ?e sall se. Off wyn and quheyt thar is in Rychmwnt schyr And othir stuff off fud that ?e desyr, Quharoff I trow ?he sall be weyll content.” The ost was glaid and thiddyrwart thai went. Mony trew Scot was semblyt in that land. To Wallace com weill ma than ix thowsand; Off presone part, sum had in lawbour wrocht, Fra athir part full fast till him thai socht. Wallace was blyth off our awn natiff kyn That come till him off baill that thai war in, And all the ost off comforde was the blythar Fra thar awn folk was multipliand the mar. In Richmwnt schyr thai fand a gret boundans, Breid, ayll and wyn, with othir purweans; Brak parkis doun, slew bestis mony ane, Off wild and tayme forsuth thai sparyt nane. Throuch-owt the land thai past in gud aray. A semly place so fand thai in thar way, Quhilk Ramswaith hecht, as Iop him selff thaim tald. Fehew was lord and Captayne in that hald. V hundreth men was semblit in that place To sawe thaim selff and thar gud fra Wallace. A ryoll sted fast by a forest sid, With turrettis fayr and garrettis off gret prid Beildyt about, rycht lykly to be wicht, Awfull it was till ony mannis sicht; Feill men abown on the wallis buskyt beyn In gud armour that burnyst was full scheyn. The ost past by and bot wesyt that place, ?eit thai within on lowd defyit Wallace And trumpattis blew with mony werlik soun. Than Wallace said, “Had we ?on gallandis doun On the playn ground thai wald mor sobyr be.” Than Iop said, “Schir, ?e gart his brodyr de In harrold weid, ?e wait, on Tynto hill.” Wallace ansuerd, “So wald I with gud will Had I him selff, bot we may nocht thaim der. Gud men mon thoill off harlottis scorn in wer.” Schir Ihon the Graym wald at a bykkyr beyn, Bot Wallace sone that gret perell has seyn, Commaundit him to lat his seruice be: “We haiff no men to waist in sic degre. Wald ye thaim harm I knaw ane othir gait, How we throuch fyr within sall mak thaim hait. Fyr has beyn ay full felloun in-to wer. On sic a place it ma do mekill der. Thar auld bulwerk I se off wydderyt ayk. War it in fyr thai mycht nocht stand a straik. Housis and wod is her enewch plente. Quha hewis best off this forest lat se. Pow housis doun, we sall nocht want adeill. The auld temyr will ger the greyn byrn weill.” At his commaund full besyly thai wrocht. Gret wod in haist about the hous thai brocht. The bulwerk wan thir men off armys brycht; To the barmkyn laid temyr apon hycht. Than bowmen schot to kep thaim fra the cast. The wall about had festnyt firis fast. Women and barnys on Wallace loud thai cry. On kneis thai fell and askit him mercy. At a quartar quhar fyr had nocht ourtayn Thai tuk thaim out fra that castell off stayn, Syn bet the fyr with brwndys brym and bauld. The rude low rais full heych abown that hauld. Barrellis off pyk, for fence was hungyn thar, All strak in fyr; the myscheiff was the mar. Quhen the brym fyr atour the place was past Than thai with-in mycht nothir schwt no cast. Als bestiall as hors and nowt within Amang the fyr thai maid a hidwys dyn. The armyt men in harnes was so hait Sum doun to ground duschit but mar debait. Sum lap, sum fell in-to the felloun fyr, Smoryt to dede and brynt bathe bayn and lyr. The fyr brak in at all opynnys about. Nayn baid on loft, so felloun was the dout. Fehew him self lap rudly fra the hycht, Throuch all the fyr can on the barmkyn lycht. With a gud suerd Wallace strak off his hed. Iop hynt It wp and turst it fra that sted. V hundreth men that war in-to that place, Gat nayne away bot dede with-outyn grace. Wallace bade still with his power that nycht. Apon the morn the fyr had fail?eit mycht. Beffor the ?ett quhar it was brynt on breid A red thai maid and to the castell ?eid; Strak doun the ?ett and tuk that thai mycht wyn, Iowellys and gold, gret Riches was tharin; Spul?eit the place and left nocht ellis thar Bot bestis brynt, bodyis and wallis bar. Than tuk thai hyr that wyff was to Fehew, Gaiff this commaund, as scho was woman trew, To turs that hed to London to king Eduuard. Scho it rasawyt with gret sorow in hart. Wallace him selff thir chargis till hyr gaiff: “Say to ?our king, bot gyff I battaill haiff, At London ?ettis we sall assail?e sayr. In this moneth we think for to be thair. Trastis in treuth, will God, we sall nocht faill, Bot I rasyst throw chargis off our consaill. The southmaist part off Ingland we sall se Bot he sek pes or ellis bargan with me. Apon a tym he chargyt me on this wys, Rycht boustously, to mak till him seruice. Sic sall he haiff as he ws caus has maid.” Than mowit thai with-out langer abaid. Deliuerit scho was fra this gud chewalry. Towart London scho socht rycht ernystfully. On to the tour but mar proces scho went, Quhar Eduuard lay sayr murnand in his entent. His newois hede quhen he saw it was brocht, So gret sorow sadly apon him socht With gret wnes apon his feit he stud, Wepand for wo for his der tendyr blud. The consaill rais and prayit him for to ces, “We los Ingland bot gyff ?e purches pes.” Than Wodstok said, “This is my best consaill, Tak pees in tyme as for our awn awaill. Or we tyne mar ?eit slaik off our curage. Erest ?e may get help to ?our barnage.” The king grantyt and bad thaim message send. Na man was thar that durst to Wallace wend. The queyn apperyt and saw this gret distance. Weill born scho was, off the rycht blud off France. Scho trowit weill tharfor to speid the erar; Hyr selff purpost in that message to far. Als scho forthocht at the king tuk on hand Agayn the rycht so oft to reyff Scotland. And feill men said the wengeance hapnyt thar, Off gret murthyr his men maid in-till Ayr. Thus demyt thai, the consaill thaim amang. To this effect the qweyn bownyt to gang. Quhen scho has seyn Ilk man for-sak this thing On kneis scho fell and askyt at the king: “Souerane,” scho said, “gyff it ?our willis be, At I desyr ?on chyftayn for to se. For he is knawin bath hardy, wys and trew, Perchance he will erar on wemen Rew Than on ?our men; ?he haiff don him sic der, Quhen he thaim seis it mowis him ay to wer. To help this land I wald mak my trawaill. It ma nocht scaith suppos it do na waill.” The lordis all off hir desir was fayn. On-to the king thai maid instans in playn That scho mycht pas. The king with aukwart will, Halff in-to yr, has giffyn consent thar-till. Sum off thaim said the queyn luffyt Wallace For the gret woice off his hie nobilnas. A hardy man that is lykly with-all, Gret fawour will off fortoun till him fall Anent wemen, is seyne in mony place. So hapnyt it in his tyme with Wallace. In his rysing he was a luffar trew And chesyt ane, quhill Inglismen hir slew. ?eit I say nocht the queyn wald on hir tak All for his luff sic trawaill for to mak. Now luff or leiff, or for help off thar land, I mak rahers as I in scriptour fand. Scho graithit hir apon a gudlye wis With gold and ger and folk at hir dewis, Ladyis with hir, nane othir wald thai send, And ald preystis that weill the cuntre kend. Lat I the queyn to message redy dycht And spek furth mar off Wallace trawaill rycht. The worthy Scottis amang thar Enemys raid. Full gret distruccioun amang Sotheron thai maid, Waistit about the land on athir sid. Na wermen than durst in thar way abid. Thai ransoun nane bot to the dede thaim dycht, In mony steid maid fyris braid and brycht. The ost was blith and in a gud estate, Na power was at wald mak thaim debate; Gret ryches wan off gold and gud thaim till, Leyffyng enewch to tak at thar awn will. In awfull fer thai trawaill throuch the land, Maid byggynis bar that thai befor thaim fand, Gret barmkynnys brak off stedis stark and strang. Thir wicht wermen off trawaill thocht nocht lang. South in the land rycht ernystfully thai socht To Sanct Tawbawnys, bot harm thar did thai nocht. The priour send thaim wyne and wenesoun, Refreschyt the ost with fud in gret fusioun. The nycht apperyt quhen thai war at the place. Thai herbreyt thaim fra thine a litill space, Chesyt a sted quhar thai suld bid all nycht; Tentis on ground and pal?onis proudly pycht In-till a waill be a small Rywer fayr, On athir sid quhar wyld der maid Repayr; Set wachis owt that wysly couth thaim kepe, To souppar went and tymysly thai slepe. Off meit and sleip thai ces with suffisiance. The nycht was myrk, our drayff the dyrkfull chance; The mery day sprang fra the oryent, With bemys brycht enlumynyt the occident. Eftir Titan, Phebus, wp rysyt fayr, Heich in the sper the signes maid declayr. Zepherus began his morow cours. The swete wapour thus fra the ground resours. The humyll breyth doun fra the hewyn awaill In euery meide, bathe fyrth, forrest and daill. The cler rede amang the Rochis rang Throuch greyn branchis, quhar byrdis blythly sang With Ioyus woice in hewynly armony. Than Wallace thocht it was no tyme to ly. He croyssit him, syne sodeynli wp rais; To tak the ayr out off his pal?on gais. Maister Ihon Blar was redy to Rawes, In gud entent syne bownyt to the mes. Quhen it was done Wallace can him aray In his armour, quhilk gudly was and gay. His schenand schoys that burnyst was full beyn, His leg harnes, he clappyt on so clene. Pullane greis he braissit on full fast, A clos byrny with mony sekyr cast, Breyst plait, brasaris, that worthy was in wer. Besid him furth Iop couth his basnet ber; His glytterand glowis grawin on athir sid. He semyt weill in battaill till abid. His gud gyrdyll and syne his burly brand, A staff off steyll he gryppyt in his hand. The ost him blyst and prayit god off his grace Him to conwoy fra all mystymyt cace. Adam Wallace and Boid furth with him ?eid By a reuir throw-out a floryst meid. And as thai walk atour the feyldis greyn Out off the south thai saw quhar at the queyn Towart the ost come ridand sobyrly, And fyfty ladyis, was in hyr cumpany, Waillyt off wit and demyt off renoun; Sum wedowis war and sum off Religioun; And vii preistis that entrit war in age. Wallace to sic did neuir gret owtrage Bot gyff till him thai maid a gret offens. Thus prochyt thai on towart thar presens. At the pal?oun quhar thai the lyoun saw To ground thai lycht and syne on kneis can faw; Prayand for pece thai cry with petous cher. Erll Malcom said, “Our chyftayn is nocht her.” He bad hyr rys and said it was nocht rycht, A queyn on kneis till ony lavar wycht. Wp by the hand the gud Erll has hyr tayn. Atour the bent to Wallace ar thai gayn. Quhen scho him saw scho wald haiff knelyt doun. In armys sone he caucht this queyn with croun And kyssyt hyr with-outyn wordis mor. Sa dyd he neuir to na Sotheron befor. “Madem,” he said, “rycht welcum mot ?e be. How plesis ?ow our ostyng for to se?” “Rycht weyll,” scho said, “off frendschip haiff we neid. God grant ?e wald off our nesis to speid. Suffyr we mon suppos it lik ws ill, Bot trastis weyll it is contrar our will.” “?e sall remayn. With this lord I mon gang. Fra ?our presens we sall nocht tary lang.” The Erll and he on to the pal?on ?eid With gud awys to deym mar off this deid. Till consell son Wallace gart call thaim to. “Lordys,” he said, “?e wait quhat is a-do. Off thar cummyng my selff has na plesance And herfor mon we wyrk with ordinance. Wemen may be contempnyng in-to wer Amang fullis that can thaim nocht forber. I say nocht this be thir nor ?eit the queyn. I trow it be bot gud that scho will meyn, Bot sampyll tak off lang tym passit by. At Rownsywaill the tresoun was playnly Be wemen maid, that Gan?elon with him brocht, And Turke wyn; forber thaim couth thai nocht. Lang ws in wer gert thaim desyr thar will, Quhilk brocht Charlis to fellon los and Ill; The flour off France withoutyn redempcioun Throuch that foull deid was brocht to confusioun. Commaund ?our men tharfor in preway wys, A-payn off lyff thai wyrk nocht on sic wys; Nane spek with thaim bot wysmen off gret waill, At Lordis ar and sworn to this consaill.” Thir chargis thai did als wysly as thai mocht. This ordynance throw all the ost was wrocht. He and the Erll bathe to the queyn thai went, Rasawyt hyr fayr and brocht hyr till a tent, To dyner bownyt als gudly as thai can And serwit was with mony likly man. Gud purwyance the queyn had with hyr wrocht. A say scho tuk off all thyng at thai brocht. Wallace persawyt and said, “We haiff no dreid. I can nocht trow ladyis wald do sic deid, To poysoun men, for all Ingland to wyn.” The queyn ansuerd, “Gyff poysoun be tharin, Off ony thyng quhilk is brocht her with me, Apon my selff fyrst sorow sall ?e se.” Sone eftir meit a marchell gart absent Bot lordis and thai at suld to consaill went. Ladyis apperyt in presens with the queyn. Wallace askyt quhat hyr cummyng mycht meyn. “For pes,” scho said, “at we haiff to ?ow socht. This byrnand wer in baill has mony brocht. ?e grant ws pees for him that deit on tre.” Wallace ansuerd, “Madeym, that may nocht be. Ingland has doyne sa gret harmys till ws We may nocht pas and lychtly leiff it thus.” “?eis,” said the queyne, “for crystyn folk we ar, For goddis saik, sen we desyr no mar, We awcht haiff pes.” “Madeym, that I deny. The perfyt caus I sall ?ow schaw, for quhy ?e seke na pes bot for ?our awn awaill. Quhen ?our fals king had Scotland gryppyt haill, For nakyn thing that he befor him fand He wald nocht thoill the rycht blud in our land, Bot reft thar rent, syne put thaim selff to ded. Ransoun off gold mycht mak ws na remed. His fell fals wer sall on him selff be seyn.” Than sobyrly till him ansuerd the queyn, “Off thir wrangis amendis war most fair.” “Madeym,” he said, “off him we ask no mar Bot at he wald byd ws in-to battaill, And god be Iuge, he kennys the maist haill.” “Sic mendis,” scho said, “war nocht rycht gud, think me. Pes now war best and it mycht purchest be. Wald ?he grant pes and trwys with ws tak, Throuch all Ingland we suld gar prayeris mak For ?ow and thaim at in the wer war lost.” Than Wallace said, “Quhar sic thing cummys throuch bost, Prayer off fors, quhar-so at it be wrocht, Till ws helpis litill or ellis nocht.” Warly scho said, “Thus wysmen has ws kend, Ay efftir wer pees is the finall end; Quharfor ?e suld off ?our gret malice ces. The end off wer is cheryte and pes. Pees is in hewyn with blys and lestandnas. We sall beseke the pape off his hie grace Till commaund pes sen we may do na mar.” “Madeym,” he said, “or ?our purches cum thar Mendys we think off Ingland for to haiff.” “Quhat set ?ow thus,” scho said, “so god ?ow saiff, Fra violent wer at ?e lik nocht to duell?” “Madem,” he said, “the suth I sall ?ow tell. Eftir the dayt off Alexanderis ryng Our land stud thre ?er desolate, but king, Kepyt full weyll at concord in gud stait. Throuch ii clempt thar hapnyt gret debait, So ernystfully, accord thaim nocht thai can. ?our king thai ast for to be thar ourman. Slely he slayd throuch strenthis off Scotland. The kynryk syne he tuk in his awn hand. He maid a kyng agayn our rychtwys law, For he off him suld hald the Regioun aw. Contrar this band was all the haill barnage, For Scotland was ?eit neuir in-to thrillage. Gret Iulius that tribut gat off aw, His wynnyng was in Scotland bot full smaw. Than your fals king, wndyr colour but mar, Throuch band he maid till Bruce that is our ayr, Throuch all Scotland with gret power thai raid, Wndid that king quhilk he befor had maid. To Bruce sen syne he kepit na connand. He said he wald nocht ga and conques land Till othir men, and thus the cas befell. Than Scotland throuch he demayned him sell, Slew our elderis, gret pete was to se. In presone syne lang tyme thai pynit me Quhill I fra thaim was castyn out for ded. Thankit be god, he send me sum Remed. Wengyt to be I prewyt all my mycht. Feyll off thar kyn to dede syn I haiff dycht. The Rage off ?outh gert me desyr a wyff.

He suld haiff payn that saikles sic ane slewch. Ingland sen syn has bocht it der enewch, Thocht scho had beyn a queyn or a prynsace.” “Madem,” he said, “as god giff me gud grace, In-till hir tym scho was als der to me, Prynsace or queyn, in quhat stait so thai be.” “Wallace,” scho said, “off this talk we will ces.

Scho trowit with gold that he mycht be ourset. Thre thousand pound off fynest gold so red Scho gert be brocht to Wallace in that sted. “Madeym,” he said, “na sic tribut we craiff. Anothir mendis we wald off Ingland haiff, Or we raturn fra this regioun agayn, Off ?our fals blud that has our elderis slayn. For all the gold and ryches ?e in ryng ?e get no pes bot desir off ?our king.” Quhen scho saw weill gold mycht hyr nocht releiff, Sum-part in sport scho thocht him for to preiff. “Wallace,” scho said, “yhe war clepyt my luff; Mor baundounly I maid me for to pruff, Traistand tharfor ?our Rancour for to slak. Me think ?e suld do sum thing for my saik.” Rycht wysly he maid ansuer to the queyn. “Madem,” he said, “and verite war seyn That ?e me luffyt, I awcht ?ow luff agayn.

Quhen Wallace saw the fredom off the queyn, Sadly he said, “The suth weyll has beyn seyn, Wemen may tempt the wysest at is wrocht. ?our gret gentrice it sall neuir be for nocht.

Glaidly thai drank, the queyn and gud Wallace, Thir ladyis als and lordis in that place. Hyr leyff scho tuk with-out langar abaid, V myile that nycht south till a nonry raid. Apon the morn till London passit thai. In Westmenster quhar at the consaill lay Wallace ansuer scho gart schaw to the king. It nedis nocht her rahers mar off this thing. The gret commend that scho to Wallace gaiff Befor the king, in presens off the laiff, Till trew Scottis it suld gretly apples, Thocht Inglismen tharoff had litill es. Off worschip, wyt, manheid and gouernans, Off fredom, trewth, key off Remembrans, Scho callyt him thar in-to thar hye presens, Thocht contrar thaim he stud at his defens. “So chyftaynlik,” scho said, “as he is seyn In-till Inglande I trow has neuir beyn.

Agayn he past with souerance till his king. Than chesyt thai thre lordis for this thing, The keyn Clyffurd, was than thar warden haill, Bewmont, Wodstok, all men off mekill waill. Quhat thir thre wrocht the layff suld stand thar-till. The kingis seyll was gyffyn thaim at thar will. Sone thai war brocht to spekyng to Wallace. Wodstok him schawit mony suttell cace. Wallace, he herd the sophammis euire-deill. “As ?eit,” he said, “me think ?e meyn bot weill. In wrang ?e hald, and dois ws gret owtrage, Off housis part that is our heretage. Owt off this pees in playn I mak thaim knawin, Thaim for to wyn, sen that thai ar our awin, Roxburch, Berweik, at ouris lang tym has beyn, In-to the handis off ?ou fals Sotherone keyn.

Rycht at his will thai haiff consentit haill, For nakyn thing the pees thai wald nocht faill. The ?ong Randell at than in London was, The lord off Lorn, in this band he can as, The Erll off Bowchane, bot than in tendyr age— Eftir he grew a man off hycht, wys and large. Cumyn and Soullis he gart deliuer als, Quhilk eftir was till king Robert full fals. Wallang fled our and durst nocht bid that mute; In Pykardte till as him was na bute, Bot Wallace wald erar haff had that fals knycht Than x thousand off fynest gold so brycht. The Bruce he askyt, bot he was had away Befor that tym till Calys mony day. King Eduuard prewyt that thai mycht nocht him get; Off Glosestir his wncle had him fet, At Calys than had haly in kepyng. Wallace that tym gat nocht his rychtwys king. The Erll Patrik fra London alsua send Wyth Wallace to mak, as weill befor was kend, Off his mater a fynaill gouernance; Till king Eduuard he gaiff wp his legeance And tuk till hald off Scotland euirmar. With full glaid hart Wallace resauit him thar. Thai honowryt him rycht reuerendly as lord. The Scottis was all reiosyt off that conford. A hundreth hors with ?ong lordis off Renoune Till Wallace com, fred out off that presoune. Wndyr his seill king Eduuard than gert send For till gyff our and mak a fynaill end Roxburch, Berweik, quhilk is off mekill waill To Scottis men and all the boundis haill. To fyve ?er trew thai promyst be thar hand. Than Wallace said, “We will pas ner Scotland Or ocht be seld and tharfor mak ws boun. Agayn we will besid Northallyrtoun, Quhar king Eduuard fyrst battaill hecht to me. As it began thar sall it endyt be. Gret weyll ?our queyn,” he chargyt the message. “It is for hyr at we leyff our wiage.” A day he set quhen thai suld meit him thar And seill this pees with-outyn wordis mar. Apon the morn the ost but mar awys Tranountyt north apon a gudly wys. To the set tryst that Wallace had thaim maid The Inglis message com but mar abaid. Thai seyllyt the pes with-out langar delay. The message than apon the secund day Till London went in all the haist thai can. The worthi Scottis with mony gudly man Till Bambwrch com with all the power haill, Sexte thousand, all Scottis off gret waill. X dayis befor All Halow Ewyn thai fur. On Lammes day thai lycht on Caram mur. Thar lugyt thai with plesance as thai mocht, Quhill on the morn at preistis to thaim socht In Caram kyrk, and sessyt in his hand Roxburch keyis as thai had maid connand, And Berweik als quhilk Sotheroun had so lang. Thai frede the folk in Ingland for to gang, For thar lyffis wschet off athir place. Thai durst nocht weill bid rekynnyng off Wallace. Capdane he maid in Berweik off Renoun That worthy was, gud Crystell of Cetoun. Kepar he left till Roxburch castell wicht Schir Ihon Ramsay, a wys and worthi knycht. Syn Wallace selff with Erll Patrik in playn To Dunbar raid, and restoryt him agayn In his castell and all that heretage, With the consent off all the haill barnage. Quhen Wallace was agreit and this lord, To rewll the Rewm he maid him gudly ford. Scotlande atour fra Ros till Soloway sand He raid it thrys and statut all the land. In the Leynhous a quhyll he maid repayr. Schyr Ihon Menteth that tym was captane thar; Twys befor he had his gossep beyn, Bot na frendschip betwix thaim syn was seyn! Twa monethis still he duelt in Dunbertane; A hous he foundyt apon the Roch off stayne. Men left he thar till byg it to the hycht, Syn to the March agayn he rydis rycht. In-to Roxburch thai chesyt him a place; A gud tour thar he gert byg in schort space. The kynrik stud in gud worschip and es. Was nayn so gret durst his nychtbour disples. The abill ground gert laubour thryftely. Wictaill and froyte thar grew aboundandly. Was neuir befor syn this was callyt Scotland Sic welth and pes at-anys in the land. He send Iop twys to Bruce in Huntyntoun, Besekand him to cum and tak his croun. Conseill he tuk at fals Saxionis allace. He had neuir hap in lyff to get Wallace. Thre ?er as thus the Rewm stud in gud pes. Off this saying me wordis for to ces, And forthyr furth off Wallace I will tell In-till his lyff quhat awentur ?eit fell. BOOK IX A ryoll king, than Ryngyt in-to France, Gret worschip herd off Wallace gouernance: Off prowis, prys, and off his worthi deid, And forthwart, fair, commendede off manheid, Bathe humyll, leyll, and off his prewyt prys, Off honour, trewth, and woid off cowatis. The nobill king ryngand in Ryolte Had gret delyte this Wallace for to se, And knew rycht weill, schortly to wndyrstand, The gret supprys and ourset off Ingland. Als merueld he off Wallace small power, That but a king tuk sic a rewm to ster Agayn Ingland, and gert thar malice ces Quhill thai desyryt with gud will to mak pes. And rycht onon a herrold gert he call. In schort termys he has rehersit him all Off his entent completly till ane end. Syn in Scotland he bad him for to wend. And thus he wrait than in-till gret honour To Wil?am Wallace as a conquerour: “O lowit leid, with worschip, wys and wicht, Thow werray help in haldyn off the rycht; Thou rycht restorer off thi natyff land, With goddis grace agayn thi fais to stand; In thi defens helpar of rychtwys blud; O worthy byrth and blessyt be thi fud, As it is red in prophecy beforn In happy tym for Scotland thow was born. I the besek with all humylite My clos lettir thow wald consaiff and se; As ?our brodyr I crystyn king off France, To the berer ?e her and gyff credance.” The herrold bownd him and to the schip is gone. In Scotland sone he cummyn is onon, Bot harrold lyk he sekis his presens. On land he went and maid no residens In ony steid; quhar he presumyt, thar So on a day he fand him, in-to Ayr, In gud affer and manlik cumpany. The harrold than with honour reuerendly Has salust him apon a gudly maner, And he agayn with humyll, hamly cher Rasauit him in-to rycht gudly wys. The harrold than, with worschip to dewys, Be-tuk till him the kingis wryt off France, Wallace, on kne with lawly obeysance, Rycht reuerendly for worschip off Scotland. Quhen he it red and had it wndirstand, At this herrold he askyt his credence With aspre spech and manly contenence, And he him tald as I haiff said befor The kingis desyr, quhat nedis wordis mor: “The hye honour and the gret nobilnas Off ?our manheid, weill knawin in mony place, Him likis als weill ?our worschip till awance As ?he war born a liege man off France. Sen his regioun is flour off rewmys seyn, Als the gret band off kindnes ?ow betweyn, It war worschip his presens for to se Sen at this rewm standis in sic degre.” Wallace consawit with-outyn tarying The gret desyr off this gud nobill king, Syn till him said, “As God off hewin me sawe, Her-eftir sone ?e sall ane ansuer hawe Off ?our desyr that ?e hawe schawit me till. Welcum ?e ar with a fre hartly will.” The harrold baid on-to the xx?? day, With Wallace still in gud weill-fayr and play Contende the tyme with worschip and plesance. Be gud awys maid his deliuerance, With his awn hand he wrait on-to the king All his entent as twyching to this thing. Rycht rych reward he gaiff the harrold tho And him conwoyde, quhen he had leyff to go, Out off the toun with gudly cumpanye. His leyff he tuk, syn went on-to the se. Gud Wallace than has maid his prouidance; His purpos was to se the king off France; Erest in weyr to Sanct Ihonstoun couth fair. A consaill than he had gert ordand thar. In-till his sted he chesyt a gouernour To kep the land, a man off gret walour, Iamys gud lord, the Stewart off Scotland; Quhilk fadyr was as storys beris on hand Till gud Walter, that was off hye parage, Mariory the Bruce syne gat in mariage. Tharoff to spek as now I haiff no space; It is weill knawin, thankit be goddis grace. And to the harrold, with-outyn residens How he approchit to the kingis presens. Fra the Rochell the land sone has he tayn. Atour the landis he graithit him to gayn, Sekand the king als gudly as he may. So to the court he passit on a day, To Parys went, was peirles off renoun. The king, that tym held palace in that toun, Quhen he hym saw graithly has wndirstand. He speryt tithingis and weyllfayr off Scotland. The herrold said in-to thir termys schort That all was gud; he had the mar comfort. “Saw thow Wallace, the chyftayn off that land?” And he said, “?a, that I dar tak on hand, A worthyar this day lyffand is nayn In way off wer, als fer as I haiff gayn, The hie worschip and the gret nobilnes, The gud weillfair, plesance and worthines. The Rych reward was mychty for to se That for ?our saik he kythyt apon me, And his ansuer in wryt he has ?ow send.” The king Rasauit it with a lycht attend, This hie affect and dyt off his writyng: “O ryoll roy and rychtwys crownyt king, ?he knaw this weill be othir ma than me, How that our rewlm standis in perplexite. The fals nacioun that we are nychtbouris to, Quhen plesis thaim thai mak ws ay ado. Thar may na band be maid so sufficians Bot ay in it thai fynd a warians. To wait a tym, will god at it may be, With-in a ?er I sall ?our presens se.” Off this ansuer weill plessyt was the king. Leyff I him thus in Ryolte to ryng And glaid comford, rycht as I haiff ?ow told. Off Wallace furth I will my proces hold. In Aperill, the one and twenty day, The hie calend, thus Cancer, as we say, The lusty tym off Mayus fresche cummyng Celestiall gret blythnes in to bryng; Pryncypaill moneth forsuth it may be seyn, The hewynly hewis apon the tendyr greyn; Quhen old Saturn his cloudy cours had gon, The quhilk had beyn bath best and byrdis bon; Zepherus ek with his suet vapour, He comfort has, be wyrking off natour, All fructuous thing in-till the erd adoun At rewllyt is wndyr the hie Regioun; Sobyr Luna in flowyng off the se; Quhen brycht Phebus is in his chemage hie, The Bulys cours so takin had his place; And Iupiter was in the Crabbis face; Quhen Aryet the hot syng coloryk, In-to the Ram quhilk had his Rowmys Ryk, He chosyn had his place and his mansuun In Capricorn, the sygn off the lioun; Gentill Iupiter with his myld ordinance Bath Erb and tre reuertis in plesance, And fresch Flora hir floury mantill spreid In euery waill, bath hop, hycht, hill and meide— This sammyn tym, for thus myn auctor sayis, Wallace to pas off Scotland tuk his wayis. Be schort awys he schup him to the se And fyfty men tuk in his cumpane. He leit no word than walk off his passage Or Inglismen had stoppit him his wiage, Nor tuk na leiff at the lordis off the parlement; He wyst full weill thai wald nocht all consent To suffer him out off the land to go. For-thi onon with-outyn wordis mo He gart forse and ordand weill his schip; And thir war part past in his falowschip, Twa Wallace, was his kynnys-men full ner, Craufurd, Kneland, was haldyn till him der. Off Kyrkcubre he purpost his passage. Semen he feyt and gaiff thaim gudlye wage. Thai wantyt nocht off wyn, wictaill nor ger, A fair new barge, rycht worthi, wrocht for wer. With that thai war a gudly cumpany Off waillit men had wrocht full hardely; Bonalais drank rycht glaidly in a morow, Syn leiff thai tuk and with “Sanct Ihon to borow” Bottis was schot and fra the Roch thaim sent. With glaid hartis at-anys thai in went. Wpon the schip thai rowit hastely. The seymen than, walkand full besyly, Ankyrs wand in wysly on athir syd, Thair lynys kest and waytyt weyll the tyd, Leyt salys fall and has thar cours ynom. A gud gay wynd out off the rycht art com. Frekis in forstame rewllit weill thar ger; Ledys on luff burd with a lordlik fer Lansys laid out to luk thar passage sound. With full sayll thus fra Scotland furth thai found, Salyt haill our the day and als the nycht. Apon the morn quhen at the son rais brycht The schip master on to the top he went. Sowthest he saw that trublyt his entent, Saxten salis arayit all on raw, In colour reid, and towart him couth draw. The gliterand son apon thaim schawit brycht, The se about enlumynyt with the lycht. This mannis spreit was in ane extasy. Doun went he sone and said full sorowfully, “Allace,” quod he, “the day that I was born! With-out rameid our lywys ar forlorn. In cursyt tym I tuk this cur on hand. The best chyftayn and reskew off Scotland, Our raklesly I haiff tayn vpon me With waik power to bryng him throw the se. It forsyt nocht, wald God I war torment, So Wallace mycht with worschip chaip wnschent!” Quhen Wallace saw and hard this mannys mon To comfort him in gud will is he gon. “Maister,” he said, “quhat has amowit the?” “Nocht for my selff,” this man said petuisle, “Bot off a thing I dar weill wndirtane, Thocht all war heyr the schipis off braid Bertane Part suld we los, set fortoun had it suorn. The best wer-man in se is ws beforn Leffand this day and king is off the se.” Wallace sone sperd, “Wait thow quhat he may be?” “The Rede Reffayr thai call him in his still. That I him saw euyr waryt worth that quhill! For myn awn lyff I wald no murnyng mak. Is no man born that ?on tyran wil tak. He savis nayn for gold nor othir gud, Bot slayis and drownys all derffly in the flud. He gettis no grace thocht he war king or knycht. This xvi ?er he has doyn gret wnrycht. The power is so strang he has to ster May non eschaip that cummys in his danger. Wald we him burd, na but is to begyn; The lakest schip that is his flot within May sayll ws doun on-to a dulfull ded.” Than Wallace said, “Sen thow can no ramed Tell me his feyr and how I sall him knaw, Quhat is hys oys, and syn go luge the law.” The schipman sayis, “Rycht weill ?e may him ken Throu graith takynnys, full clerly by his men. His cot armour is seyn in mony steid, Ay battaill boun, in Riwell ay off reid. This formest schip that persewis ?ow so fast Hym selff is in; he will nocht be agast. He wyll ?ow hayll quhen that he cummys ?ow ner. With-out tary than mon ?he stryk on ster. Hym selff will entir fyrst full hardely. Thir ar the syngys that ?e sall knaw him by: A bar off blew in-till his schenand scheild, A bend off greyn desyren ay the feild. The Rede betakynnys blud and hardyment, The greyn curage encressand his entent; The blew he beris becaus a crystyn man.” Sadly agayn Wallace ansuerd than, “Thocht he be crystynyt this war no godlyk deid. Go wndyr loft. Sanct Androw mot ws speid!” Bathe schip maistir and the ster-man also In the holl but baid he gert thaim go. His fyfty men with-outyn langar rest Wallace gart ray in-to thar armour prest. Fourty and aucht on luff burd laid thaim law. Wyl?ham Crawfurd than till him gert he caw And said, “Thow can sumpart off schipman fair. Thi oys has beyn oft in the toun off Ayr. I pray the tak this doctryn off me. Luk at thow stand strekly be this tre. Quhen thai bid stryk, to seruice be thow bane. Quhen I the warn, lat draw the saill agane. Kneland, cusyng, cum tak the ster on hand. Her on the waill ner by the I sall stand. God gyd our schip; as now I say na mar.” The barge began with a full werlik far; Him selff on loft was with a drawyn suord And bad his ster-man lay thaim langis the bourd. On loude he cryit, “Stryk, doggis! ?e sall de!” Crawfurd leit draw the saill a litill we. The capdane sone lap in and wald nocht stynt. Wallace in haist be the gorget him hynt, On the our-loft kest him quhar he stud, Quhill neys and mowth all ruschit out off blud. A forgyt knyff but baid he bradis out. The wer schippis was lappyt thaim about. The mekill barge had nocht thaim clyppyt fast; Crawfurd drew saill, skewyt by and off thaim past. The reiffar criyt with petous woice and cler Grace off hys lyff. “For him that bocht ?ow der, Mercy,” he said; “for him that deit on rud, Layser to mend. I haiff spilt mekill blud. For my trespas I wald mak sum ramed. Mony saikles I haue gart put to ded.” Wallace wyst weyll, thocht he to ded war brocht, Fra thaim to chaip on na wyse micht he nocht, And off his lyff sum reskew mycht he mak. A bettir purpos sone he can to tak, And als he rewyt him for his lyff was ill. In Latyn tong rycht thus he said him till: “I tuk neuir man that enemy was to me. For goddis saik thi lyff I grant to the.” Bathe knyff and suerd he tuk fra him onon, Wp be the hand as presoner has him ton And on his suerd scharply he gert him suer, Fra that day furth he suld him neuir der. “Commaund thi men,” quod Wallace, “till our pes.” Thar schot off gown, that was nocht eith to ces. The cast it was rycht awfull on athir sid. The Rede Reiffar commaundyt thaim to bid, Held out a gluff in takyn off the trew. His men beheld and weyll that sen?e knew, Left off thar schot that sygn quhen that thai saw. His grettast barge towart him can he caw: “Lat be ?our wer; thir ar our freyndis at ane. I traist to god our werst dayis ar gane.” He ast Wallace to do quhat was his will. With schort awys rycht thus he said him till, “To the Rochell I wald ?e gert thaim saill. For Inglismen I wait nocht quhat may aill.” He thaim commaund forouttin wordis mair: “Turne saill and wynd, towart the Rochell fair, For thar, god will, is our purpos to be. Skour weyll about for scoukaris in the se.” His commaund thai did in all the haist thai can. Wallace desyryt to talk mor with this man. Sadly he sperd, “Off quhat land was thou born?” “Off France,” quod he, “and my eldris beforn, And thar we had sumpart off heretage; ?et fers fortoun thus brocht me in a rage.” Wallace sperd, “How com thow to this lyff?” “Forsuth,” he said, “bot throw a sudan stryff. So hapnyt me in-to the kingis presens Our raklesly to do our gret offens, A nobill man off gud fame and Renoun That throw my deid was put to confusioun, Dede off a straik. Quhat nedis wordis mor? All helpyt nocht thocht I repentyt full sor. Throw freyndys off the court I chapyt off that place And neuir sen syn couth get the kingis grace. For my saik mony off my kyn gert thai de; And quhen I saw it mycht no bettir be, Bot leyff the land that me behuffyt o neid, Apon a day to Burdeous I ?eid. Ane Inglis schip so gat I on a nycht For sey lawbour that ernystfully was dycht. To me thar semblyt misdoaris and weill mo, And in schort tym we multiplyit so Wes few that micht contrair our power gang. In tyranry thus haiff we Rongyn lang. This sexten ?er I haiff beyn on the se And doyn gret harm, tharfor full wa is me. I savit nayn for gold nor gret Ransoun Bot slew and drownyt in-to the se adoun. Fawour I did till folk off syndry land, Bot Franchmen no frendschip with me fand; Thai gat no grace als fer as I mycht ryng. Als on the se I clypyt was a king. Now se I weyll that my fortoun is went, Vincust with ane; that gerris me sair rapent! Quha wald haiff said this sammyn day at morn I suld with ane thus lychtly doun be born! In gret hething my men it wald haiff tane. My selff trowit till machit mony ane, Bot I haiff found the werray playn contrar. Her I gyff our roubry for euirmar. In sic mysrewll I sall neuir armes ber, Bot gyff it be in honest oys to wer. Now haiff I told ?ow part off my blys and payn. For goddis saik sum kyndnes kyth agayn. My hart will brek bot I wyt quhat thou be, Thus outrageously that has rabutyt me; For weill I wend that leyffand had beyn non Be fors off strenth mycht me as presoner ton, Except Wallace that has rademyt Scotland, The best is callit this day beltyt with brand. In-till his wer war worschip for to wak. As now in warld I trow he has no mak.” Tharat he smylit and said, “Friend, weill may be. Scotland had mystir off mony sic as he. Quhat is thi naym, tell me, so haiff thou seill.” “Forsuth,” he said, “Thomas off Longaweill.” “Weyll bruk thow it. All thus stentis our stryff. Schaip to pleys god in mendyng off thi lyff. Thi faithfull freynd my selff thinkis to be, And als my name I sall sone tell to the. For chans off wer thou suld no murnyng mak. As werd will wyrk thi fortoun mon thou tak. I am that man that thou awansis so hie, And bot schort tym sen I come to the se. Off Scotland born my rycht name is Wallace.” On kneis he fell and thankit god off grace: “I dar awow that ?oldyn is my hand To the best man that beltis him with brand. Forsuth,” he said, “this blythis me mekill mor Than off floryng ?e gaiff me sexty scor.” Wallace ansuerd, “Sen thou art her throw chance, My purpos is be this wiage in France, And to the king sen I am boun to pas To my reward thi pees I think to as.” “Pes I wald haiff fayn of my rychtwis king And no langar in-to that Realm to ryng, Thar to tak leyff and cum off it agayn. In thi seruice I think for to Ramayn.” “Seruice,” he said, “Thomas, that may nocht be, Bot gud frendschip as I desir off the”; Gart draw the wyn and Ilk man mery maid. Be this the schippis was in the Rochell raid, The rede blasonys thai had born in-to wer. The toun was sone in-till a sudane fer. The Rede Reiffar thai saw was at thar hand, The quhilk throu strenth mycht nayn agayne him stand. Sum schippis fled and sum the land has tayn. Clariownys blew and trumpattis mony ane. Quhen Wallace saw the pepill was on ster He gaiff commaund na schip suld ner apper, Bot his awin barge in-to the hawyn gart draw. The folk was fayn quhen thai that sen?e saw. Rycht weyll thai knew in gold the rede lioun, Leit wp the port, rasauit him in the toun And sufferyt thaim for all that he had brocht. The rede nawyn in-to the hawyn thai socht; On land thai went quhar thai likit to pas. Rycht few thar wyst quhat Scottis man Wallace was, Bot weyll thai thocht he was a gudly man And honouryt him in all the craft thai can. Bot iiii dayis still at Wallace remaynyt thar. Thir men he callyt quhen he was bown to fair. He thaim commaundyt apon that cost to bid Quhill he thaim fred, for chans at mycht betid: “Ber ?ow ewyn, quhat gud that euir ?he spend. Leiff on ?our awin quhill tithandis I ?ow send. Ger sell thir schippis and mak ?ow men off pes. It war gud tym off wykkitnes to ces. ?our captane sall pas to the king with me. Throu help off God I sall his warrand be.” He gert graith him in soit with his awin men. Was no man thar that mycht weill Thomas ken. Lykly he was, manlik of contenance, Lyk to the Scottis be mekill gouernance, Saiff off his tong, for Inglis had he nane. In Latyn weill he mycht suffice for ane. Thus past his court in all the haist thai may. To Paris toun thai went apon a day. Tythingis was brocht off Wallace to the king. So gret desyr he had off na-kyn thing As in that tym quhill he had seyn Wallace. To meyt him selff he waytit apon cace In a gardyng quhar he gert thaim be brocht. Till his presence with manly feyr thai socht, Twa and fyfty at anys kneland doun And salust him as ryoll off most renoun, With rewllyt spech in so gudly awys All France couth nocht mair nurtour tham dewys. The queyn had leyff and com in hyr effer, For mekill scho herd off Wallace deid in wer. Quhat nedis mor off curtassy to tell? Thai kepyt weill that to the Scottis befell. Off kingis fer I dar mak no rahers; My febill mynd my trublyt spreit rewers. Off rich seruice quhat nedis wordis mor? Mycht non be found bot it was present thor. Sone eftir meit the king to parlour went With gudly lordis, thar Wallace was present. Than commound thai off mony syndry thing. To spek with him gret desyr had the king. At him he speryt off wer the gouernance. He ansuerd him with manly contenance, Till euery poynt als fer as he had feill, In Latyn tong rycht naturaly and weill. The king consauit sone throu his hie knawlage Quhat wermen oysyt be reyff in thar passage. In-till his mynd the Rede Reiffar than was. Merwell he had how he leit Wallace pas. Till him he said, “?e war sum thing to blaym. ?e mycht haiff send be our harrold fra haym Eftir power to bryng ?ow throu the se.” “God thank ?ow schir, tharoff ynewch had we. Feill men may pas quhar thai fynd na perrell. Rycht few may kep quhar nayn is to assaill.” “Wallace,” he said, “tharoff merwell haiff I. A tyran ryngis in Ire full cruelly, Apon the se that gret sorow has wrocht. Mycht we him get it suld nocht be for nocht. Born off this land, a natyff man to me, Tharfor on ws the grettar harme dois he.” Than Thomas quok and changyt contenans. He hard the king his ewill deidis disawans. Wallace beheld and fen?eit in a part. “Forsuth,” he said, “we fand nane in that art That proffryt ws sic wnkyndlynes. Bot with ?our leiff, I spek in haymlynes, Trow ?e be sycht ?e couth that squier knaw?” “To lang it war sen tym that I him saw, Bot thir wordis off him ar bot in wayn. Or he com her rycht gud men will be slayn.” Than Wallace said, “Her I haiff brocht with me Off likly men that was in our countre. Quhilk off all thir wald ?e call him most lik?” Amang thaim blent that ryoll roy most ryk, Wesyit thaim weill, bathe statur and curage, Maner, makdome, thar fassoun and thar wesage. Sadly he said, awysit sobyrly, “That largest man quhilk standis next ?ow by Wald I call him be makdome to dewice. Thir ar no-thing bot wordis off office.” Befor the king on kneis fell gud Wallace: “O ryoll roy, off hie honour and grace, With waist wordis I will nocht ?ow trawaill. Now I will spek sum thing for myn awaill. Our barnat land has beyn our-set with wer With Saxonis blud that dois ws mekill der, Slayn our eldris, distroyit our rychtwys blud, Waistyt the Realm off gold and othir gud, And ?e ar her in mycht and ryolte. ?e suld haiff ey till our aduersite, And ws support throu kindnes off the band Quhilk is conserwyt betuix ?ow and Scotland. Als I am her at ?our charge for plesance. My lyflat is bot honest chewysance. Flour off Realmys forsuth is this regioun. To my reward I wald haiff gret gardoun.” “Wallace,” he said, “now ask quhat ?e wald haiff; Gud, gold or land, sall nocht be lang to craiff.” Wallace ansuerd, “So ?e it grant to me, Quhat I wald haiff it sall sone chosyn be.” “Quhat euir ?he ask that is in this regioun ?e sall it haiff, except my wyff and croun.” He thankit hym off his gret kyndlynes: “My reward all sall be askyng off grace, Pees to this man I brocht with me throu chans. Her I quytcleym all othir gyfftis in Frans. This sammyn is he, gyff ?e knaw him weill, That we off spak, Thomas of Longaweill. Be rygour ?e desyryt he suld be slayn. I him restor in-to ?our grace agayn. Rasaiff him fayr as liege man off ?our land.” The king merweld and couth in study stand, Perfytly knew that it was Longaweill. He him forgaiff his trespas euirilkdeill Bot for his saik that had him hydder brocht. For gold or land ellis he gat it nocht. “Wallace,” he said, “I had leuir off gud land Thre hundreth pund haiff sesyt in thi hand. That I haiff said sall be grantyt in playn. Her I restor Thomas to pes agayn, Derer to me than euir he was befor, All for ?our sak, thocht it war mekill mor. Bot I wald wyt how that merwell befell.” Wallace ansuerd, “The trewth I sall ?ow tell.” Than he rahersyt quhat hapnyt on that day As ?e befor in my autour hard say. Quhen the gud king had herd this sudan cas Apon the se, be forsicht off Wallace, The king him held rycht worthi till awans. He saw in hym manheid and gouernans; So did the queyn and all thir othir lordis. Ilk wicht off hym gret honour than recordis. He purchest pes for all the power haill, Fyfteyn hundreth was left in the Rochaill, Gert cry thaim fre, trew serwandis to the king And neuir agayn fautyt in sic thing. Quhen Thomas was restoryt to his rycht Off his awin hand the king has maid him knycht. Eftir he gaiff stayt to his nerrest ayr And maid him selff with Wallace for to fayr. Thus he was brocht fra naym off reyff throu cace, Be sudand chans off him and wicht Wallace. Thus leyff I thaim in worschip and plesance, At liking still with the gud king off France. Thai xxx?? dayis he lugyt in-to rest. So to Ramayn he thocht it nocht the best; Still in-to pes he couth nocht lang endur, Wncorduall it was till his natur. Rycht weyll he wyst that Inglismen occupyit Gyane that tym, tharfor he has aspyit Sum ieperte apon thaim for to mak. A gudly leyff he at the kyng couth tak. Off Franchmen he wald nayne with him call At that fyrst tym, for auentur mycht fall, Bot schir Thomas that seruice couth persew. He wyst nocht weyll gyff all the layff was trew. Off Scottis men thai semblyt hastely, Ix hundyr-sum off worthi chewalry; In Gyan land full haistely couth ryd, Raissyt feill fyr and waistyt wonnyngis wid. Fortras thai brak and stalwart byggyngis wan, Derffly to dede brocht mony Sotheron man. A werlik toun so fand thai in that land Quhilk Schenown hecht, that Inglismen had in hand. Towart that steid full sadly Wallace socht, Be ony wys assail?e gyff he mocht, Bargane till haiff and he mycht get thaim out. Gret strenth off wod that tym was thar about. This toun stud als apon a wattir sid. In-till a park that was bath lang and wyd Thai buschit thaim quhill past was the nycht. Quhen the sone rais four hundreth men he dycht. The laiff he gert Craufurd in buschement tak, Geyff thai mysterit a reskew for to mak. Than Longaweill that ay was full sawage With Wallace past as ane to that scrymmage. Thir four hundreth rycht wondyr weyll arayit Befor the toun the playn baner displayit, Was nocht to thaim weill knawyn in that contre, The lyoun in gold rycht awfull for to se, A forray kest and sessit mekill gud. Wermen with-in that playnly wndyrstud Sone wschit furth the pray for to reskew. The worthi Scottis feill Inglismen thai slew. The laiff for dreid fled to the toun agayn. The forray tuk the pray and past the playn Towart the park, bot power off the toun Wschyt agayn in awfull battaill boun, A thousand hayle wyth men off armys strang. Few baid tharin that mycht to bargane gang. Than Wallace gert the forreouris leyff the pray, Assemblyt sone in-till a gud aray. A cruel conterans at that metyng was seyn Off wicht wermen in-to thar armour cleyn. Feyll lossyt thar lyff apon the Sotheroun sid, Bot nocht-for-thi rycht bauldly thai abyd. Off the Scottis part than worthi men thai slew. Wyl?ham Craufurd that weyll the perell knew, Out off the park he gert the buschement pas In to the field quhar feyll men fechtand was. At thar entre thai gert full mony de. The Inglismen was wondyr laith to fle. Full worthely thai wrocht in-to that place. Baid neuir sa few so lang agayn Wallace Wyth sic power as he that day was thar; On athir syd assail?eit ferly sayr. In-to the stour so fellonly thai wrocht Rycht worthy men derffly to dede thai brocht, Wyth poyntis persyt throuch platis burnyst brycht. Wallace hym-selff and gud Thomas the knycht, Quhom that thai hyt maid neuir mor debait. The Sotheron part was handlyt thar full hayt. In-to that place thai mycht no langar byd. Out off the feyld with sar hartis thai ryd. On to the toun thai fled full haistely. Wallace folowit and his gud chewalry, Fechtand so fast in-to the thykkest thrang Quhill in the toun he enterit thaim amang, With him Crawfurd and Longaweill off mycht And Rychard als Wallace his cusyng wicht. Fyfteyn thai war off Scottis cumpany. Thus hapnyt thai amang the gret party. A cruell portar gat apon the wall, Powit out a pyn, the portculys leit fall. Inglismen saw that entrit was na ma. Apon the Scottis full hardely thai ga, Bot tyll a wall thai haiff thar bakkis set, Sad strakys and sayr bauldly about thaim bet. Rychard Wallace the turn-greys weill has seyn. He folowit fast apon the portar keyn, A-tour the wall dede in the dyk him draiff, Tuk wp the port and leit in all the layff. Quhen Wallace men had thus the entre won Full gret slauchtir agane thai haff begon. Thai savit nayn apon the Sotheroun syd That wapynnys bar or harnes in that tid. Wemen and barnys, the gud thai tuk thaim fra, Syn gaiff thaim leyff in-to the realm to ga, And preystis als that war nocht in the feild, Off agyt men quhilk mycht na wapynnis weild. Thai slew nayn sic, so Wallace chargis was, Bot maid thaim fre at thar largis to pas. Ryches off gold thai gat in gret plente, Harnes and hors that mycht thaim weill supple, Wyth Franch folk plenyst the toun agayn. On the x day the feyld thai tuk in playn. The Riwer doun in-to the land thai socht. On Sotheron men full mekill maistre thai wrocht. Quhen to the king trew men had tald this taill, Off Franchmen thai semblyt a battaill, Xx?? thousand off lele legis off Frans. Hys brothir thaim led, was duk of Orlyans. Throu Gyan land in rayid battaill thai raid To folow Wallace, and maid but litill baid For Frans supple to help thaim in thair rycht. Ner Burdeous or thai our-tak him mycht Gud Wallace was and chosyn had a playn, For sum men tald that Burdeous with gret mayn With-in schort tym thocht battaill for to geyff; Bot fra thai wyst that Franch folk couth raleiff Wyth gret power, for helpyng off Wallace, Wthyr purpos thai tuk in-to schort space. In Pykarte sone message thai couth send; Off Wallace com thai tald it till ane end. Off Glosister captane off Calys was The hardy Erll, and maid him for to pas In Ingland sone and syne to London went. Off Wallace deid he tald in the parlement. Sum playnly said that Wallace brak the pes. Wysmen said “Nay,” and prayit thaim for to ces. Lord Bowmont said, “He tuk bot for Scotland And nocht for Frans, that sall ?e wndyrstand. Gyff our endentour spekis for ony mair He has doyne wrang, the suth ?e may declayr.” Wodstok ansuerd, “Schir, ?e haiff spokyn weill, Bot contrar resone that taill is euirilkdeill. Gyff ?one be he that band for him and his May na man say bot he has wrocht a mys, For pryncipaly he band with ws the trew And now agayn begynnys a malice new. Schyr king,” he said, “gyff ?e think euir to mak On Scotland wer, on hand now ?e sall tak Quhill he is out, or ellis it helpis nocht.” As Wodstok said the haill consaill has wrocht. Power thai raissyt on Scotland for to ryd, Be land and se; thai wald no langar byd. Thar land ost thai rayit weyll in-deid. Thar wantgard tuk the hardy Erll to leid Off Glosister, that off wer had gret feill. Off Longcastell the duk demanyt weill The mydillward; on to the se thai send Schyr Ihon Sewart that weyll the northland kend.

Dunde thai tuk and putt Scottismen to dede. In Fyff fra thaim was nocht kepyt a stede, And all the south fra Cheuyet to the se. In-to the west thar mycht na succour be. The worthy lord that suld haiff gouernyt this God had hym tayn we trow in lestand blys. Hys son Walter, that bot a child than was, Trew men him tuk and couth in Arrane pas. Adam Wallace than wyst off no supple, Till Rawchle went, and Lindsay off Cragge. Gud Robert Boid in But maid residens. For haisty desait thai tuk thaim to defens. Schyr Ihon the Graym in Dundaff mycht nocht bid; Succour he socht in-to the forest off Clid.

Gud Hew the Hay was send in-to Ingland And vthir ayris to presoune at thar will. The northland lordis saw na help cum thaim till. A squier Guthre amang thaim ordand thai To warn Wallace in all the haist he may. Out off Arbroth he passit to the se And at the Slus land takyn son had he. In Flandrys land no residens he maid; In Frans he past, bot Wallace weill abaid On his purpos, in Gyan at the wer. On Sotheroun men he had doyn mekill der. Quhill gud Guthre had gottyn his presens He haistyt him sone and maid no residens. He has him tald with Scotland how it stud. Than Wallace said, “Thai tithingis ar nocht gud. I had exampill off tym that is by-worn, Trewys to bynd with thaim that was maynsuorn; Bot I as than couth nocht think on sic thing Be-caus that we tuk this pees with thar king.

With thre hundreth to Ochtyrhous he past. VOL. II. BOOK X The later day off August fell this cace. For the reskew thus ordanyt wicht Wallace Off Sanct Ihonstoun that Sothroun occupyit. Fast towart Tay thai passyt and aspyit, Or it was day wndyr Kynnowll thaim laid. Out off the toun as Scottis men till hym said, That serwandys oysyt with cartis hay to leid, So was it suth and hapnyt in-to deid. Saxsum thar com and brocht bot cartis thre. Quhen thai off hay was ladand most bysse, Guthre with ten in handys has thaim tayn, Put thaim to dede, off thaim he sawyt nayn. Wallace gert tak in haist thar humest weid And sic-lik men thai waillyt weill gud speid. Four was rycht rud. Wallace hym selff tuk ane, A rwsset clok; and with him gud Ruwane, Guthre, Besat, and als gud ?emen twa, In that ilk soit thai graithit thaim to ga. Xv thai tuk off men in armes wicht; In ilk cart v thai ordanyt owt off sycht. Full sutelly thai coueryt thaim with hay, Syne to the toun thai went the gaynest way. Thir cartaris, had schort suerdis off gud steill Wndyr thar weidis, callyt furth the cartis weill. Schyr Ihon Ramsay baid with a buschement still, Quhen myster war to help thaim with gud will. Thir trew cartaris past on with-outyn let A-tour the bryg and entryt throu the ?et; Quhen thai war in thar clokis kest thaim fra. Gud Wallace than the mayster portar can ta Wpon the ned, quhill dede he has him left, Syn othir twa the lyff fra thaim has reft. Guthre, Besat, did rycht weyll in the toun And Ruwan als dang off thar famen doun. The armyt men, was in the cartis brocht, Rais wp and weill thar dawern has wrocht. Apon the gait thai gert feill Sothroun de. The Ramsais spy has seyn thaim get entre; The buschement brak, bathe bryg and port has won. Into the toun gret stryff thar was begon. Twentie and ane, or Ramsay come in playn, Within the toun had saxte Sotheroun slayn. The Inglismen on till aray was gayn. The Scottis as than layser leit thaim get nayn. Fra gud Ramsay with his men entryt In Thai sawit nayn was born off Inglis kyn. Als Longaweill, the wicht knycht schir Thomas, Prewyt weill than and in mony othir place. Agayn his dynt few Inglismen mycht stand. Wallace with him gret faith and kyndnes fand. The Sotheroun part saw weill the toun was tynt; Freschly thai ferd as fyr dois out off flynt. Sum fled, sum fell in-to draw dykis deip, Sum to the kyrk thar lywys giff thai mycht keip; Sum fled to Tay and in small weschell ?eid, Sum derffly deit and drownyt in that steid. Schir Ihon Sewart at the west port owt past; Till Meffen wod he sped him wondyr fast. A hundreth men the kyrk tuk for succour Bot Wallace wald no grace grant in that hour; He bad slay all off cruell Sotheroun keyn, Said thai had to Sanct Ihonstoun Enemys beyn. Four hundreth men in-to the toun war ded. Sewyn scor with lyff chapyt out off that sted. Wyffis and barnys thai maid thaim fre to ga; With Wallace wyll he wald sla nayn off tha. Riches thai fand that Inglismen had brocht new, Syn plenyst the toun with worthi Scottis trew. Schyr Ihon Sewart left Meffen forest strang, Went to the Gask with feyll Sotheroun amang And syn in Fyff quhar Wallang schirreff was; Send currowris sone out throw the land to pas And gaderyt men, a stalwart cumpany. Till Ardargan he drew him prewaly, Ordand thaim in bargan reddy boun. Agayn he thocht to sail?e Sanct Ihonstoun, Quhar Wallace lay and wald no langar rest, Rewllyt the toun as that him likyt best. Schyr Ihon Ramsay gret captane ordand he, Ruwan schirreff, at ane accord for to be. This charge he gaiff, gyff men thaim warnyng maid To cum till him with-outyn mor abaid, And so thai did quhen tithingis was thaim brocht. With a hundreth Wallace furth fra thaim socht. To Fyfe he past to wesy that cuntre, Bot wrangwarnyt off Inglismen was he. Schyr Ihon Sewart, quhen thai war passyt by, Fra the Ochell he sped him haistely, Vpon Wallace folowit in all his mycht, In Abyrnethy tuk lugyng that fyrst nycht. Apon the morn with xv hundreth men Till Blak Irnsyde his gydys couth thaim ken. Thar Wallace was and mycht no message send Till Sanct Ihonstoun, to mak this Iornay kend, For Inglismen that full sutell has beyn Gart wachis walk that nayn mycht pas betweyn. Than Wallace said, “This mater payis nocht me.” He cald till him the squier gud Guthre And Beset als, that knew full weyll the land, And ast at thaim quhat deid was best on hand, “Message to mak our pouer for to get. With Sotheroun sone we sall be wmbeset; And wykked Scottis that knawis this forest best, Thai ar the caus that we may haiff no rest. I dreid fer mar Wallang that is thar gyd Than all the layff that cummys on that syd.” Than Guthre said, “Mycht we get ane or tway To Saynct Iohnstoun, it war the gaynest way, And warn Ramsay, we wald get succour sone. Our suth it is it can nocht now be don. Rycht weyll I wait weschell is lewyt nayn Fra the Wood hawyn to the ferry cald Aran.” Than Wallace said, “The water awfull is. My selff can swym, I trow, and fall na mys, Bot currours oys, that gaynis nocht for me; And leyff ?ow her ?et had I leuir de. Throw goddis grace we sall bettir eschew. The strenth is stark, als we haiff men Inew. In Elchoch park bot fourty thar war we For sewyn hundreth and gert feill Sothron de, And chapyt weill in mony wnlikly place; So sall we her throw help off goddis grace. Quhill men may fast thir woddis we may hauld still. Forthi ilk man be off trew hardy will, And at we do so nobill in-to deid Off ws be found no lak eftir to reid. The rycht is ouris, we suld mor ardent be.

Wallace said, “Nay, thai wordys are in wayn. We will nocht leyff that may be our wantage. The wod till ws is worth a ?eris wage.” Off hewyn temyr in haist he gert thaim tak, Syllys off ayk, and a stark barres mak At a foyr frount, fast in the forest syd, A full gret strenth quhar thai purpost to bid; Stellyt thaim fast till treis that growand was That thai mycht weyll in fra the barres pas, And so weill graithit on athir sid about Syn com agayn, quhen thai saw thaim in dout. Be that the strenth arayit was at rycht The Inglis ost approchyt to thair sycht. Than Sewart com that way for till haiff wend As thai war wount, so his gydis thaim kend. At that entre thai thocht till haiff passage But sone thai fand that maid thaim gret stoppage. A thousand he led off men in armes strang. With v hundreth he gert Ihon Wallang gang With-out the wod that nayn suld pas thaim fra. Wallace with him had fourty archarys thra; The layff was speris, full nobill in a neid. On thar Enemys thai bykkyr with gud speid. A cruell cwntyr was at the barres seyn. The Scottis defens so sykkyr was and keyn Sotheroun stud aw to enter thaim amang. Feill to the ground thai our-threw in that thrang. A rowm was left quhar part in frount mycht fayr. Quha entrit In agayn ?eid neuirmar. Fourty thai slew that formast wald haiff past. All dysarayit the ost was and agast, And part off hors, throw schot to dede was brocht, Brak to a playn. The Sotheroun fra them socht. The Sewart said, “Allace, how may this be And do no harm? Our gret rabut haiff we.” He cald Wallang and askyt his consaill: “Schyrreff thow art. Quhat may be our awaill? Bot few thai ar that makis this gret debait.” Iohn Wallang said, “This is the best I wait, To ces her-off and remayn her besyd, For thai may nocht lang in this forest byd. For fawt off fud thai mon in the cuntre. Than war mar tym to mak on thaim melle. Or thai be won befors in-to this stryff Feyll at ?e leid sall erar los the lyff.” Than Sewart said, “This reid I will nocht tak. And Scottis be warnyt reskew sone will thai mak. Off this dispyt amendys I think to haiff, Or de thar-for in nowmyr with the laiff. In-till a rang myselff on fut will fayr.” Viii hundreth he tuk off liklyest that was thair, Syn bad the layff bid at the barres still With Ihon Wallang to rewyll thaim at this will. “Wallang,” he said, “be forthwart in this cace. In sic a swar we couth nocht get Wallace. Tak hym or sla, I promes the be my lyff That king Edwart sall mak the Erll off Fyff. At ?on est part we think to enter in. I bid no mar. Mycht ?e this barres wyn, Fra thai be closyt graithly amang ws sa, Bot merwell be, thai sall na ferrer ga. Assail?e sayr quhen ?e wit we cum ner. On athir sid we sall hald thaim on ster.” Thus semlyt thai apon ane awfull wys. Wallace has seyn quhat was thair haill dewys. “Gud men,” he said, “wndirstud ?e this deid? Forsuth thai ar rycht mekill for to dreid. ?on Sewart is a nobill, worthy knycht, Forthwart in wer, rycht hardy, wys and wicht. His assail?e he ordannys wondyr sayr.

Sen we are stad with Enemys on Ilk syd And her on fors mon in this forest bid, Than fray the fyrst for goddis saik cruellye, That all the layff off ws abayssyt be.” Crawfurd he left and Longaweill the knycht, Fourty with thaim, to kepe the barres wicht. With him saxte off worthy men in weid To meit Sewart with hardy will thai ?eid. A maner dyk in-to that wod wes maid Off thuortour rys, quhar bauldly thai abaid. A doun-with waill the Sothroun to thaim had. Son semblyt thai with strakis sar and sad. Scharp sperys fast duschand on athir sid Throw byrnys brycht maid woundis deip and wid. This wantage was, the Scottis thaim dantyt swa, Nayn Inglisman durst fra his feris ga To brek aray, or formast entyr in. Off crystin blud to se it was gret syn For wrangwis caus, and has beyn mony day. Feyll Inglismen in the dyk deid thai lay. Speris full sone all in-to splendrys sprang. With scharp suerdys thai hew on in that thrang. Blud byrstyt out throw fyn harnes off maill. Ihon Wallang als full scharply can assaill Apon Crawfurd and the knycht Longaweill, At thar power kepyt the barres weill, Maid gud defens be wyt, manheid and mycht. At the entre feyll men to dede thai dycht. Thus all at-anys assail?eit in that place, Nayn that was thar durst turn fra the barrace To help Wallace, nor none of his durst pas To reskew thaim, so feyll the fechtyng was. At athir ward thai handelyt thaim full hayt. Bot do or de na succour ellis thai wayt. Wallace wes stad in-to that stalwart stour, Guthre, Besat, with men off gret walour, Rychard Wallace that worthi was off hand. Sewart merweillyt that contrar thaim mycht stand, That euyr so few mycht byd in battaill place Agaynys thaim and metyng face for face. He thocht hym selff to end that mater weill, Fast pressyt in with a gud suerd off steill. In-to the dyk a Scottis man gert he de. Wallace tharoff in hart had gret pyte. Amendis till haiff he followit on him fast, Bot Inglismen so thik betwex thaim past That apon him a strak get mycht he nocht. Wthyr worthy derffly to dede he brocht. Sloppys thai maid throu all that chewalry. The hardy Scottis thai wrocht so worthely. Than Sothron saw off thar gud men so drest, Langar to bid thai thocht it nocht the best. Four scor was slayn or thai wald leyff that steid And fyfty als was at the barrace deid. A trumpet blew and fra the wod thai draw. Wallang left off, that sycht fra that he saw. To sail?e mar thaim thocht it was no speid. Withowt the wod to consaill son thai ?eid. The worthy Scottis to rest thaim was full fayn. Feyll hurtis had bot few off thaim was slayn. Wallace thaim bad of all gud comfort be: “Thankit be god, the fayrer part haiff we. ?on knycht Sewart has at gret Iornay beyn. So sair assay I haiff bot seildyn seyn. I had leuir off Wallang wrokyn be Than ony man that is off ?on men?he.” The Scottis all on to the barres ?eid, Stanchit woundis that couth full braithly bleid. Part Scottis men had bled full mekill blud. For faut off drynk and als wantyng off fud Sum feblyt fast that had feill hurtis thar. Wallace tharfor sichit with hart full sar. A hat he hynt, to get water is gayn. Othir refut as than he wyst off nayn. A litill strand he fand that ran hym by. Off cler watter he brocht haboundandly, And drank him selff, syn said with sobyr mud, “The wyn off Frans me thocht nocht halff so gud.” Than off the day three quartaris was went. Schir Ihon Sewart has castyn in his entent: To sail?e mar as than he couth nocht preiff, Quhill on the morn that mar men couth raleiff And kep thaim in, quhill thai for hungyr sor Cum in his will or ellis de tharfor. “Wallange,” he said, “I charge the for to bid And kep thaim In. I will to Coupar rid. Thow sall remayn with v hundreth at thi will, And I the morn sall cum with power the till.” Ihon Wallange said, “This charg her I forsaik. Eftir this day all nycht I may nocht waik; For trastis weill, thai will ische to the playn, Thocht ?e bid als, or ellis de in the payn.” Sewart bad byd or undyrly the blaym: “I the commaund on gud king Eduuardis naym, Or thar to god a vow I mak beforn, And thai brek out, to hyng the heych to-morn!” Off that commaund Ihon Wallang had gret dreid. Sewart went fra thaim with ix scor in-to deid. Next hand the wod and his gud men off Fyff, That with him baid in all term off thar lyff, Wallace drew ner, his tym quhen that he saw, To the wod syd and couth on Wallang caw: “?on knycht to-morn has hecht to hyng the hie. Cum in-till ws. I sall thi warrand be In-contrar him and all king Eduuardis mycht. Tak we him quyk I sall him hyng on hycht, And gud lordschip I sall gyff the hereft In this ilk land, that thi brothir has left.” Wallange was wys, full sone couth wndyrstand Be lyklynes Wallace suld wyn the land, And better him war in-to the rycht to bid Than be in wer apon the Sotheroun sid. Wyth schort wysment to Wallace in thai socht. Than Sewart criyt and said, “That beis for nocht, And fals off kynd thow art in heretage. Eduuard on the has waryt ewill gret wage. Her I sall byd my purpos to fulfill, Othir to de or haiff the at my will.” For all his spech to pas he wald nocht spar. Wyth full glaid hart Wallace resawyt thaim thar. Be that Ruwan and Ramsay off renown, Be a trew Scot that past to Sanct Ihonstoun, Thaim warnyng maid that Sewart folowit fast Apon Wallace, than war thai sayr agast; Owt off the toun thai wschit with all thar mycht, With thre hundreth that worthi war and wicht, Till Blak Irnsid assemblyt in that place As Wallang was gayn in to gud Wallace. The knycht Sewart has weill thar cummyng seyn, A fayr playn feild he chesyt thaim betweyn. Xi hundreth and four scor than had he. The Scottis men war v hundreth and saxte; Thai war bot few a playn feild for to tak. Out of the wod gud Wallace can him mak. He wyst no thing off thaim that cummyn was; Mar hardement was fra the strenth to pas. Bot quhen thai hard Ruwan and Ramsay cry, Off Ochtyrhous, blyth was that chewalry. Mycht thai off gold haiff brocht a kingis rent, To gud Wallace mycht nocht so weyll content. Than till aray thai ?eid on athir sid In cruell Ire, in battaill bown to byd. Worthiar men than Sewart semblyt thar In all his tym Eduuard had neuirmar. Bot Sewart saw his nowmyr was fer ma; Hys power sone he gart dewyd in twa. To fecht at-anys rycht knychtlik he thaim kend, In that Iornay othir to wyn or end. The worthi Scottis ruschyt on thaim in gret Ire With cruell strakis that flawmyt fers as fyr. Wallace and his, als Sotheroun that was thar Few speris had for feyll fechtyng and sar In-to the wod at sail?e all the day, Bot new cummyn men weill waillyt speris had thai. In-to the stour thai gart feill Sotheroun de. Thar cruell deid gret merweill was to se. Thai worthi Scottis that fyrst amang thaim baid Full gret slauchtir on Inglismen thai maid; In-to the wod befor had prewyt weill, Than on the playn thai son?eit nocht adeill In curage grew as thai war new begon. Schort rest thai had fra ryssyng off the son. Be that Ramsay and with him gud Ruwar Throw-owt the thykkest off the pres is gan. Sloppis thai maid amang the Inglismen, Deseueryt thaim be twenty and by ten; Quhen sperys war gayn, with suerdys off metall cler Till Inglismen thar cummyng sauld full der. Wallace and his be worthines off hand Feyll Sotheroun blud gart licht wpon the land. The twa feildys togiddyr relyt than. Schyr Ihon Sewart, with mony nobill man To help thair lord, with thre hundreth in place About hym stud and did thair besinas, Defendand him with mony awfull dynt, Quhill all the owtwart off the feild was tynt. Off comowns part in to the forest fled, Succour to sek thar men had thaim so led. The Scottis has seyn so mony in a rout With Sewart stand, na warrand thaim about; Apon all syd assail?eit wondyr sayr, Throu polyt platis with poyntis persyt thair. The Sotheroun maid defens full cruelly. All occupyit was this gud chewalry. Schyr Ihon Ramsay wald thai had ?oldyn beyn. Wallace said, “Nay, it is all wrang ?e meyn. Ranson to mak we can nocht now begyn. On sic awys this land we may nocht wyn. ?on knycht off lang our auld Enemy has beyn. So fell till ws off thaim I haiff nocht seyn. Now he sall de; with help off goddis grace He com to pay his Ranson in this place.” The Sotheroun wyst all playnly for to de, Reskew was nayn suppos at thai wald fle. Freschlye thai faucht as thai war entryt new. Apon our sid part worthy men thai slew. Than Sewart said, “Alace, throw wrangwis thing Our lywys we los, throu desyr off our king.” The felloun knycht dowtyt his dede rycht nocht. Amang the Scottis full manfully he wrocht. Besat he straik to dede with-outyn mar. Wallace prest in with his suerd burnyst bar. At Sewartis hals he etlyt in gret Ire, Throu pissanis stuff in sondyr strak the swyr. Dede to the ground he duschit for all his mycht. Off Wallace hand thus endyt this gud knycht. The ramaynand with-out mercy thai sla. For gud Besat the Scottis was wondyr wa. In handis sum thai straik with-out remed. Na Sotheroun past with lyff out off that sted. Than to the wod, for thaim that left the feild, A rang thai set, thus thai may get na beild. ?eid nayn away was contrar our pun?oun. Gud Ruwan past agayn to Sanct Ihonstoun. Schyr Ihon Ramsay to Coupar castell raid. That hous he tuk, for defens nayn was maid. Wallace, Crawfurd, and with thaim gud Guthre, Rychard Wallace had lang beyn in melle, And Longaweill, in-to Lundoris baid still. Fastyt thai had to lang agayn thar will. Wallange thai maid thar stwart for to be. Off meit and drynk thai fand aboundandle. The priour fled and durst na reknyng bid; He was befor apon the tothir syd. Apon the morn to Sanct Androwis thai past, Owt off the toun that byschop turnyt fast. The kyng off Ingland had him hydder send; The rent at will he gaiff hym in commend. His kingis charge as than he durst nocht hald. A wrangwys pape that tyrand mycht be cald. Few fled with him and gat away be see. For all Scotland he wald nocht Wallace se. As than off him he maid bot lycht record, Gert restor him that thar was rychtwys lord. The worthy knycht that in-to Coupar lay Gart spul?e it apon the secund day, Syn ordand men, at the commaund off Wallace, But mar proces for to cast doun that place. Mynouris sone thai gert pers throw the wall, Syn pounciouns fyryt and to the ground kest all. Schyr Ihon Ramsay syne to the kyrk can fayr. Sotheroun was fled and left bot wallis bayr. Eftir Sewart thai durst nocht tary lang. The Scottis at large out throu all Fyff thai rang, Off Inglismen nayn left in that cuntre; Bot in Lochlewyn thair lay a cumpane, Apon that Inch, in a small hous thai dycht, Castell was nayn, bot wallyt with water wicht. Besyd Carraill thai semblyt Wallace beforn. His purpos was for till assay Kyngorn. A knycht hecht Gray, than Captane in It was, Be schort awys purpos he tuk to pas. Erar he wald bid chalans off his king Than with Wallace to rakyn for sic a thing. That hous thai tuk and litill tary maid. Apon the morn with-outyn mar abaid Atour the mur, quhar thai a tryst had set, Ner Scotlande Well thair lugyng tuk but let. Eftir souper Wallace bad thaim ga rest: “My selff will walk. Me think it may be best.” As he commaundyt but gruching thai haiff don. In-to thar slep Wallace him graithit son, Past to Lochlewyn as it was ner mydnycht, Xviii with him at he had warnyt rycht. Thir men wend weill he come to wesy it. “Falows,” he said, “I do ?ow weill to wyt; Considyr weill this place and wndirstand That it may do ful gret scaith to Scotland. Out off the south and power cum thaim till Thai may tak In and kepyt at thair awn will. Apon ?on Inche rycht mony men may be And syn wsche out thar tym quhen at thai se. To bid lang her we may nocht wpon chans. ?on folk has fud, trast weill, at sufficians. Wattir fra thaim forsuth can nocht be set. Sum wthyr wyill ws worthis for to get. ?he sall remayn her at this port all still And I my selff the boit sall bryng ?ow till.” Thair-with in haist his weid off castis he, “Apon ?on sid na wachman can I se”; Held on his sark and tuk his suerd so gud, Band on his nek, and syn lap in the flud And our he swam, for lattyng fand he nocht. The boit he tuk and till hys men it brocht, Arayit him weill and wald no langar bid, Bot passyt In, rowit to the tothir sid. The Inch thai tuk with suerdis drawyn in hand And sparyt nayn that thai befor thaim fand, Strak duris wp, stekyt men quhar thai lay. Apon the Sothroun thus sadly semblyt thai. Xxx?? thai slew that was in that Samyn place. To mak defens the Inglismen had no space. Thar women v Wallace send off that sted. Woman nor barn he gart neuir put to dede. The gud thai tuk as it had beyn thar awyn. Than Wallace said, “Falowis, I mak ?ow knawin, The purwyance that is with-in thir wanys We will nocht tyne. Ger sembyll all at-anys. Gar warn Ramsay and our gud men Ilkan. I will remayn quhill this warnstor be gan.” Send furth a man, thar horsis put to kep, Drew wp the boit, syne beddys tuk to sleip. Wallace power, quhilk Scotland Well ner lay, Befor the son thai myssyt him away. Sum menyng maid and merweillyt off that cace. Ramsay bad, “Ces, and murn nocht for Wallace. It is for gud at he is fra us went. It sall ?e se, trast weill in werrament, My hed to wed Lochlewyn he past to se. Bot that is thar, no Inglisman knaw we In all this land betwix thir watteris left. Tithandis off hym ?e sall se son hereft.” As thai about was talkand on this wys A message com and chargyt thaim to rys. “My lord,” he said, “to dyner has ?ow cald In-till Lochlewyn, quhilk is a ryoll hald. ?e sall fair weyll, tharfor put off all sorow.” Thai graithit thaim rycht ayrly on the morow And thidder past off Wallace will to wytt. Thus semblyt thai in a full blyth falowschip. Thai lugyt thar till viii dayis was at end. Off meit and drynk thai had Inewch to spend; Turssyt furth ger that Sothroun had brocht thar, Gert byrn the boit, till Sanct Ihonstoun thai fair. Byschop Synclar, that worthy was and wys, Till Wallace com and tald him his awys. Thus he desyryt Wallace suld with him ryd And in Dunkell soiorn that wynter tyd. Bot he said, “Nay, that hald I nocht the best. And Scotland thus, in pes we can nocht rest.” The byschop said, “Playnly ?e may nocht wend. In-to the north for men I rede ?ow send.” “I grant,” quod he, and cheissit a messynger, The worthi Iop, was with the byschop ther; And maister Blair to Wallace com bot baid With that gud lord, that nobill cher thaim maid. Wallace send Blayr, in-to his preistis weid, To warn the west, quhar freyndys had gret dreid How they suld pas or to gud Wallace wyn; For Inglismen, thai held thaim lang in twyn. Adam Wallace and Lyndsay that was wycht, Rawchle thai left and went away be nycht; Throu-out the land to the Lennox thai cair Till erll Malcom that welcummyt thaim full fair. Maister Ihon Blair was blith off that semble. Gud Graym was thair and Richard off Lunde, Als Robert Boid that out off But thaim socht. Had thai Wallace off no thing ellis thai roucht, Bot Inglismen betuix thaim was so strang That thai in playn mycht nocht weyll to him gang. Iop past north, for leiching wald nocht let. Gret power thar as than he couth nocht get. The lord Cwmyn, that Erll off Bouchane was, For auld Inwy he wald lat na man pas That he mycht let, in gud Wallace supple. For Erll Patrik a playn feild kepyt he. ?eit pur men com and prewyt all thair mycht To help Wallace, in fens off Scotlandis rycht. The gud Randell, in tendyr age was kend, Part off gud men out off Murray he send. Iop past agayn and com in presens sone Befor Wallace and tauld how he had don; Bot maister Blayr so gud tithingis him brocht That off Cwmyn Wallace full litill rocht. Als Inglismen had than full mekill dreid; Fra Fyff was tynt the war thai trowyt to speid. The duk and Erll that in Scotland thaim led Captanys thai maid, In Ingland syn thaim sped. Wallace hym bownyt, qwhen he thocht tym suld be, Off Sanct Ihonstoun and with him tuk fyfte. Stewin off Irland and Kerle that was wicht, For Inglismen thai had haldyn the hycht In wathman lyff, and fayndyt thaim rycht weill. Till gud Wallace thai war als trew as steill; To folow him thai twa thocht neuyr lang. Throuch the Ochell thai maid thaim for to gang. Off mar power he taryt nocht that tyd. To keip the land he gert the laiff abid. To Styrlyng bryg as than he wald nocht pas For strang power of Inglismen thar was. Till Erth ferry thai passit prewaly And buschit thaim in a dern sted thar by. A cruell Captane in-till Erth duelt thar, In Ingland born and hecht Thomlyn off Wayr. A hundreth men was at his ledyng still. To bruk that land thai did power and will. A Scottis fyschar quhilk thai had tayn beforn, Contrar his will gert him be to thaim suorn, In thar seruice thai held him day and nycht. Befor the son Wallace gart Iop him dycht And send him furth the passage for to spy. On that fyschar he hapnyt sodandly, All him allayn bot a boy that was thar. Iop hynt hym son, and for no dreid wald spar, Be the collar, and owt a knyff pullit he. “For goddis saik,” this man askit, “merce!” Iop sperd sone, “Off quhat nacioun art thow?” “A Scot,” he said, “bot Sothroun gart me vow In thar seruice, agayn my will full sayr; Bot for my lyff that I remaynit thair. To sek fysch I com on this north sid. Be ?e a Scot I wald fayn with ?ow bid.” Than he him brocht in presens to Wallace. The Scottis was blyth quhen thai haiff seyn this cace, For with his boit thai mycht weill passage hawe. For fery craft na fraucht he thocht to crawe. Apon that syd langar thai taryed nocht. Till the south land with glaid hartis thai socht, Syn brak the boit quhen thai war landyt thayr. Serwice off it Sotheroun mycht haiff no mayr. Than throuch the mos thai passit full gud speid. Till the Torwod this man with thaim thai leid. The wedow thar brocht tithandis to Wallace Off his trew Eyme that duelt at Dunypace. Thomlyn off Wayr in presoun had him set For mar tresour na he befor mycht get. Wallace said, “Deym, he sall weill lowsyt be Be none to-morn, or ma tharfor sall de.” Scho gat thaim meit and in quiet thai baid Quhill it was nycht, syn redy sone thaim maid, Towart Arth hall rycht sodeynly thaim drew. A strenth thar was that weyll the fyschar knew, Off draw dykis and full off watter wan. Wysly tharoff has warnyt thaim this man. On the baksid he led thaim prewale, Fra the watter as wont to cum was he. Our a small bryg gud Wallace entryt In. In-to the hall hym selff thocht to begyn. Fra the sowper as thai war bown to rys He salust thaim apon ane awfull wys. His men hym folowit sodanly at-anys. Haisty sorow was rassyt in thai wanys; With scherand suerdis scharply about thaim dang. Feyll on the flur was fellyt thaim amang. With Thomlyn Wayr Wallace hym selff has met, A felloun strak sadly apon him set, Throuch hede and swyr all throuch the cost him claiff. The worthy Scottis fast stekit off the layff, Kepyt duris and dulfully thaim dycht. To chaip away the Sotheroun had no mycht. Sum wyndowys socht for till haiff brokyn out, Bot all for nocht, full fey was maid that rout. Aboue the fyr bruschit the blud so red. A hundreth men was slayn in-to that sted. Than Wallace socht quhar his wncle suld be. In a dyrk cawe he was set dulfulle, Quhar watter stud, and he in yrnys strang. Wallace full sone the brasis wp he dang, Off that myrk holl brocht him with strenth and lyst. Bot noyis he hard, off no thing ellis he wyst. So blyth befor in warld he had nocht beyn As thar with sycht quhen he had Wallace seyn. In dykys owt the dede bodyis thai kest, Graithyt the place as at thaim likyt best, Maid still gud cher and wys wachis gert set. Quhill ner the day thai slepe with-outyn let; Quhen thai had lycht spul?eid the place in hy, Fand gaynand ger, baithe gold and Iowelry; Our all that day in quiet held thaim still. Quhat Sothroun come thai rasawyt with gud will. In that laubour the Scottis was full bayn: Inglismen com bot nayn ?eid owt agayn, Women and barnys put in the presonys cawe So thai mycht mak no warnyng to the lawe. Stewyn off Irland and Kerle that wes wicht Kepyt the port. Apon the secund nycht, Befor the day, the worthy Scottis rays, Turssyt gud ger and to the Torwod gays; Remaynyt thar quhill nycht was cummyn on hand, Syn bownyt thaim in quiet throuch the land. The wedow sone, fra thai had passit dout, A serwand send and leit the women out To pas fra Arth, quhar at thaim likit best. Now spek off thaim that went in-to the west. Wallace hym selff was sekyr gyd that nycht. Till Dunbertane the way he chesyt rycht. Or it was day, for than the nycht was lang, On to the toun full prewaly thai gang. Mekill off it Inglismen occupyit. Gud Wallace sone throu a dyrk garth him hyit And till a hous, quhar he was wont to ken A wedow duelt, was frendfull till our men. Abone hyr bed, on the baksid, was maid A dern wyndow, was nothir lang nor braid; Thar Wallace cauld, and sone fra scho him knew In haist scho rays, and prewaly thaim In drew Till a clos bern quhar thai mycht kepyt be. Baith meit and drynk scho brocht in gret plente. A gudly gyft to Wallace als scho gaiff, A hundreth pownd and mar atour the layff. Ix sonnys scho had, was lykly men and wicht, Ane ayth till him scho gart thaim swer full rycht. In pees thai duelt, in trubyll that had beyn, And trewbut payit till Inglis capdanis keyn. Schir Ihon Menteth the castell had in hand, Bot sum men said thar was a prewa band Till Sotheroun maid, be menys off that knycht, In thar supple to be in all his mycht. Tharoff as now I will no proces mak. Wallace that day a schort purpos can tak. Quhen it was nycht he bad the wedow pas, Merk all the duris quhar Sotheroun duelland was; Syn efftir this he and his chewalry Graithyt thaim weill and wapynnys tuk in hy, Went on the gayt quhen Sotheroun was on slep. A gret oystre our Scottis tuk to kep. Ane Inglis captane was sittand wp so lait Quhill he and his with drynk was maid full mait. Nyn men was thar now set in hye curage: Sum wald haiff had gud Wallace in that rage, Sum wald haiff bound schir Ihon the Grayme throuch strenth, Sum wald haiff had Boyd at the suerdis lenth, Sum wyst Lundy that chapyt was off Fyff, Sum wychtar was na Cetoun in-to stryff. Quhen Wallace hard the Sotheroun maid sic dyn He gart all byd and hym allayn went In. The layff remaynyt to her off thar tithans. He salust thaim with sturdy contenance. “Falowis,” he said, “sen I com last fra haym In trawaill I was our land and wncouth fame. Fra south Irland I com in this cuntre The new conquest off Scotland for to se. Part off ?our drynk or sum gud I wald haiff.” The Captane than a schrewed ansuer him gaiff: “Thow semys a Scot wnlikly, ws to spy. Thow may be ane off Wallace cumpany. Contrar our king he is ryssyn agane. The land off Fyff he has rademyt in plane. Thou sall her byd quhill we wyt how it be. Be thow off his thou sall be hyngyt hye.” Wallace than thocht it was na tym to stand. His nobill suerd he gryppyt son in hand, Aukwart the face drew that captane in teyn, Straik all away that stud abowne his Eyn, And othir braithly in the breyst he bar. Baith brawn and bayn the burly blaid throuch schar. The layff ruschyt wp to Wallace in gret Ire. The thryd he feld full fersly in the fyr. Stewyn off Irland and Kerle in that thrang Kepyt na charge bot entryt thaim amang, And othir ma that to the dure can pres. Quhill thai him saw thar coud no thing thaim ces. The Sotheroun men full sone was brocht to ded. The blyth hosteler bad thaim gud ayle and breid. Wallace said, “Nay, till we haiff laysar mar. To be our gyd thow sall befor ws fayr And begyn fyr quhar at the Sotheroun lyis.” The hostellar son apon a hasty wys Hynt fyr in hand and till a gret hous ?eid, Quhar Inglismen was in full mekill dreid, For thai wyst nocht quhill that the rud low rais; As wood bestis amang the fyr than gays, With paynis fell ruschyt full sorowfully. The layff with-out off our gud chewalry, At Ilka hous quhar the hostillar began Kepyt the duris; fra thaim chapyt na man For all thar mycht, thocht king Eduuard had suorn. Gat nayn away that was off Ingland born, Bot othir brynt or but reskew was slayn, And sum throuch force drywyn in the fyr agayn. Part Scottis folk in seruice thaim amang Fra ony payn frely thai leit thaim gang. Thre hundreth men was to Dunbertan send To kep the land, as thair lordis thaim kend. Skaithles off thaim for ay was this regioun. Wallace or day maid him out off the toun; On to the coyff off Dunbertane thai ?eid And all that day thar soiornd out off dreid. Baith meit and drynk the hostillar gert be brocht. Quhen nycht was cummyn in all the haist thai mocht Towart Rosneth full ernystfully thai gang, For Inglismen was in that castell strang. On the Garlouch thai purpost thaim to bid Betwix the kyrk that ner was thar besyd, And to the castell full prewaly thai draw. Wndyr a bray thai buschyt thaim rycht law, Lang the wattyr, quhar common oys had thai, The castellis stuff, on to the kyrk Ilk day. A maryage als that day was to begyn. All wschyt owt and left na man with-in At fens mycht mak, bot serwandis in that place. Thus to that tryst thai passyt wpon cace. Wallace and his drew thaim full prewaly Nerhand the place, quhen thai war passyt by, With-in the hauld, and thocht to kep that steid Fra Sotheroun men or ellys tharfor be deid, Compleit was maid the mariage in-to playn; On-to Rosneth thai raturnyt agayn. Four scor and ma was in that cumpany Bot nocht arayit as was our chewalry. To the castell thai weynd to pas but let. The worthy Scottis so hardly on thaim set Xl?? at-anys derffly to ground thai bar. The ramaynand affrayit was so sayr, Langar in feild thai had no mycht to bid Bot fersly fled fra thaim on athir sid. The Scottis thar has weyll the entre woun And slew the layff that in that hous was foun; Syn on the flearis folowid wondyr fast, Na Inglisman thar fra thaim with lyff at past. The wemen sone thai seysyt in-to hand, Kepyt thaim clos for warnyng off the land. The dede bodyes all out off sycht thai kest. Than at gud es thai maid thaim for to rest. Off purwians vii dayis thai lugyt thar; At rud costis to spend thai wald nocht spar. Quhat Sotheroun come thai tuk all glaidly In, Bot out agayn thai leit Nane off that kyn. Quha tithandis send to the Captane off that steid, Thar seruitouris the Scottis put to ded; Spul?eid the place and left na gudis thar, Brak wallis doun and maid that byggyng bar. Quhen thai had spilt off stayne werk at thai mocht Syn kendillyt fyr and fra Rosneth thai socht. Quhen thai had brynt all tre werk in that place Wallace gert freith the wemen off his grace. To do thaim harm neuir his purpos was. Than to Faslan the worthy Scottis can pas, Quhar Erll Malcom was bidand at defence. Rycht glaid he was off Wallace gud presence. Than he fand thar a nobill cumpany: Schir Ihon the Graym and Richard off Lundy, Adam Wallace that worthy was and wys, Berklay and Boid, with men mekill to prys. At Cristinmes thar Wallace soiornyt still. Off his modyr tithandis was brocht him till That, tym befor, scho had left Elrisle. For Inglismen In it scho durst nocht be. Fra thine dysgyst scho past in pilgrame weid; Sum gyrth to sek to Dunfermlyn scho ?eid. Seknes hyr had so socht in-to that sted Decest scho was, god tuk hir spreit to leid. Quhen Wallace hard at that tithandis was trew, How sadnes so in Ilka sid can persew, In thank he tuk be-caus it was naturaill. He lowyt god with sekyr hart and haill. Bettyr him thocht that It was hapnyt sa; Na Sotheroun suld hyr put till othir wa. He ordand Iop and als the maister Blayr Thiddyr to pas and for no costis spayr, Bot honour do the corp till sepultur. At his commaund thai seruit Ilka hour, Doand thar-to as dede askis till haw. With worschip was the corp graithit in grawe. Agayn thai turnyt and schawit him off hir end. He thankit god quhat grace that euir he send; He seis the warld so full of fantasie. Confort he tuk and leit all murnyng be. His most desyr was for to freith Scotland. Now will I tell quhat new cas com on hand. Schyr Wil?am lang, off Douglacedaill was lord, Off his fyrst wyff, as rycht was to record, Decest or than out off this warldly cair, Twa sonnys he had with hyr that leyffyt thair Quhilk likly war and abill in curage, To sculle was send in-to thar tendre age. Iames and Hev, so hecht thir brethyr twa. And eftir sone thar wncle couth thaim ta; Gud Robert Keth had thaim fra Glaskow toun, Atour the se in Frans he maid thaim boun. At study syn he left thaim in-to Parys With a maister that worthy was and wys. The king Eduuard tuk thar fadyr that knycht And held him thar thocht he was neuir so wicht, Quhill tym he had assentit till his will. A mariage als thai gert ordand him till, The lady Fers, off power and hye blud, Bot tharoff com till his lyff litill gud. Twa sonnys he gat on this lady but mar. With Eduuardis will he tuk his leiff to far, In Scotland com and brocht hys wyff on pes, In Douglas duelt, forsuth this is no les. Kyng Eduuard trowyt that he had stedfast beyn, Fast to thar faith, bot the contrar was seyn. Ay Scottis blud remaynyt in-to Douglace; Agayn Ingland he prewyt in mony place. The Sawchar was a castell fayr and strang. Ane Inglis Capdane that dyd feyll Scottis wrang In-till It duelt and Bewffurd he was cauld, That held all waist fra thine to Douglace hauld. Rycht ner off kyn was Douglace wiff and he, Tharfor he trowyt in pes off hym to be. Schyr Wyl?ham saw at Wallace rais agayn And rycht likly to freyth Scotland off payn. Till help him part in-till hys mynd he kest, For in that lyff rycht lang he coud nocht lest. He thocht na charge to brek apon Ingland; It was throuch force that euir he maid thaim band. A ?ong man than that hardy was and bauld, Born till him selff and Thom Dycson was cauld, “Der freynd,” he said, “I wald preyff at my mycht And mak a fray to fals Bewfurd the knycht, In Sawchar duellys and dois full gret owtrage.” Than Dycson said, “My selff in that wiage Sall for ?ow pas with Anderson to spek; Cusyng to me, frendschip he will nocht brek. For that Ilk man thar wod ledys thaim till, Throuch help off him purpos ?e may fullfill.” Schyr Wil?ham than in all the haist he mycht Xxx?? trew men in this wiage he dycht, And tauld his wyff till Drumfres he wald fayr. A tryst he said off Ingland he had thair. Thus passyt he quhar that na Sotheroun wyst, With thir xxx?? throw waist land at his lyst. Quhill nycht was cummyn he buschit thaim full law In-tyll a clewch ner the wattyr off Craw. To the Sauchar Dykson allayn he send And he son maid with Anderson this end, Dicson suld tak bathe his hors and his weid Be it was day a drawcht off wod to leid. Agayn he past and tauld the gud Dowglace, Quhilk drew him sone In-till a preway place. Anderson tauld quhat stuff that was tharin Till Thom Dicson, that was ner off his kyn: “Xl thai ar off men off mekill waill. Be thai on fute thai will ?ow sayr assayll. Gyff thow hapnys the entre for to get On thy rycht hand a stalwart ax is set. Thar-with thow may defend the in a thrang. Be Douglace wys he bydis nocht fra the lang.” Anderson ?eid to the buschement in hy. Ner the castell he drew thaim prewaly In-till a schaw Sotheroun mystraistyt nocht. To the next wode wyth Dycson syn he socht, Graithyt him a drawcht on a braid slyp and law, Changyt a hors and to the hous can caw. Arayit he was in Andersonnis weid And bad haiff In. The portar com gud speid. “This hour,” he said, “thow mycht haiff beyn away. Wntymys thow art, for it is scantly day.” The ?et ?eid wp. Dicson gat In but mar. A thourtour bande that all the drawcht wpbar, He cuttyt it; to ground the slyp can ga, Cumryt the ?et, stekyng thai mycht nocht ma. The portar son he hynt in-to that stryff. Twys throuch the hede he stekit him with a knyff. The ax he gat that Anderson off spak, A bekyn maid, tharwith the buschement brak. Douglace him selff was formest in that pres, In our the wod enteryt or thai wald ces. Iii wachmen sa, off wallis was cummyn new, With-in the clos the Scottis son thaim slew. Or ony scry was raissyt in that stour Douglace had tane the ?et off the gret tour, Rane wp a grece quhar at the capdane lay. On fut he gat and wald haiff beyn away. Our lait it was. Dowglace strak up the dur. Bewfurd he fand in-to the chawmyr flour. With a styff suerd to dede he has him dycht. His men folowit that worthy was and wycht. The men thai slew that was in-to thai wanys; Syn in the clos thai semblit all at-anys. The hous thai tuk and Sotheroun put to ded. Gat nane bot ane with lyff out off that sted; For that the ?et so lang wnstekit was, This spy he fled, till Dursder can pas, Tauld that captane that thai had hapnyt sa. Ane other he gert in-to the Enoch ga. In Tybris mur was warnyt off this cas, And Louchmaban all semblyt to that place. The cuntre rais quhen thai herd off sic thing To sege Dowglace, and hecht thai suld him hyng. Quhen Douglace wyst na wayis fra thaim chaip, To sail?e him he trowyt thai wald thaim schaip. Dicson he send apon a cursour wycht To warn Wallace in all the haist he mycht. Off the Lewynhous Wallace had tayn in playn Witht thre hundreth gud men off mekill mayn. Kynsith, a castell, he thocht to wesy it; Ane Rawynsdaill held, bot trew men leit him wyt That he was out that tym off Cummyrnauld. Lord Cumyn duelt on trewbut in that hauld. Quhen Wallace wyst, he gert Erll Malcom ly With ii hundreth in a buschement ner by, To kep the hous that nayn till it suld fayr. He tuk the layff and in the wod ner thar A scurrour he set, to warn quhen he saw ocht. Son Rawynsdaill com; off thaim he had na thocht. Quhen he was cummyn the twa buschementis betweyn The scurrour warnd the cruell men and keyn. Than Wallace brak and folowit on thaim fast. The Sotheroun fled, for thai war sar agast. Rawynsdaill had as than bot [L] men. Amang the Scottis thar deidis was litill to ken. Quhen Erll Malcom had bard thaim fra the place, Na Sotheroun ?eid with lyff; thai did that grace. Part Lennox men thai left the hous to ta. On spul?eyng than thai wald na tary ma. To sege the hous than Wallace coud nocht bid. Throu-out the land in awfull feyr thai ryd. Than Lithquow toun thai brynt in-to thar gayt; Quhar Sotheroun duelt thai maid thar byggyngis hayt. The peyll thai tuk and slew that was tharin; Off Sotheroun blud thai Scottis thocht na syn; Syn on the morn brynt Dawketh in a gleid, Than till a strenth in Newbottyl wod thai ?eid; Be that Lawder and Crystall off Cetoun Com fra the Bas and brynt North Berweik toun, For Inglismen suld thar na succour get. Quham thai ourtuk thai slew with-outyn let. To meit Wallace thai past with all thar mycht, A hundreth with thaim off men in armes brycht. A blyth metyng that tym was thaim betweyn, Quhen Erll Malcom and Wallace has thaim seyn. Thom Dycson than was met with gud Wallace, Quhilk grantyt sone for to Reskew Douglace. “Dicson,” he said, “‘wait thow thar multiple?” “Iii thowsand men thar power mycht nocht be.” Erll Malcom said, “Thocht thai war thousandys v For this accioun me think that we suld stryff.” Than Hew the Hay, that duelt wndyr trewage, Off Inglismen son he gaiff our the wage; Mar for to pay as than he likyt nocht. With fyfte men with Wallace furth he socht, To Peblis past, bot no Sotheroun thar baid. Thar at the croice a playn crya thai maid. Wallace commaund, quha wald cum to his pes And byd tharat reward suld haiff but les. Gud Ruthirfurd, that euir trew has beyn, In Atryk wode agayn the Sotheroun keyn Bydyn he had and done thaim mekill der. Saxte he led off nobill men in wer. Wallace welcummyt quha com in his supple. With lordly feyr and chyftaynlik was he. Thaim till aray thai ?eid with-out the toun. Thar nowmyr was vi hundreth off renoun, In byrneis brycht, all men off mekill waill. With glaid hartis thai past in Clyddisdaill. The sege be than was to the Sauchar set. Sic tithingis com quhilk maid tharin a let; Quhen Sotheroun hard that Wallace was so ner Throw haisty fray the ost was all on ster. Na man was thar wald for ane othir byd. Purpos thai tuk in Ingland for to ryd. The chyftane said, sen thar king had befor Fra Wallace fled the causis was the mor. Fast south thai went; to bid it was gret waith. Douglace as than was thus quyt off thar scaith. In Crawfurd mur be than was gud Wallace. Quhen men him tauld that Sotheroun apon cace Was fled away and durst nocht him abid, Thre hundreth than he chessyt with him to rid In lycht harnes and hors at thai wald waill. The Erll Malcom he bad byd with the staill To follow thaim, a bakgard for to be. To stuff a chace in all haist bownyt he. Throw Dursder he tuk the gaynest gayt. Rycht fayn he wald with Sotheroun mak debait. The playnest way abone Mortoun thai hald, Kepand the hycht gyff that the Sotheroun wald Hous to persew or turn to Lochmaban, Bot tent thar-to the Inglismen tuk nan. Doune Neth thai held; graith gydys can thaim leyr. Abon Closbarn Wallace approchyt ner. In Ire he grew quhen thai war in his sycht. To thaim thai sped with wyll and all thar mycht. On a out part the Scottis set in that tyd. Sewyn scor at erd thai had sone at a syd. The Sotheroun saw that it was hapnyt sa, Turnyt in agayn sum reskew for to ma. Quhen thai trowyt best agayn Scotland to stand Erll Malcom com than rycht ner at thar hand. The hayll power tuk playn purpos to fle. Quha was at erd Wallace gert lat thaim be, Apon the formest folowit in all his mycht. The Erll and his apon the layff can lycht, Dyd all to ded wnhorssyt was that tyd. Feyll men was slayn apon the Sotheroun sid; V hundreth larg, or thai past Dawswyntoun, On Sotheroun sid to ded was brocht adoun. The Scottis hors, mony began to tyr, Suppos thaim selff was cruell, fers as fyr. The flearis left bathe wode and watterys haill; To tak the playn thai thocht it most awaill. In gret battaill away full fast thai raid. In-to strenthtis thai thocht to mak na baid. Ner Louchmaban and Lochyrmos thai went. Besyd Chrochmaid, quhar feyll Sotheroun was schent, Rycht mony hors at ronnyng had so lang And trawalyt sayr, thai mycht no forthir gang. Schyr Ihon the Graym apon his fut was set. Than Wallace als lychtyt with-outyn let. Thir twa on fute amang thar enemys ?eid. Was nayn but hors mycht fra thaim pas throw speid. On Inglismen so cruelly thai socht, Quhom thai ourtuk agayn harmyt ws nocht. To Wallace com a part off power new On restyt hors, that pertly couth persew. Adam Corre with gud men off gret waill, And Ihonstoun als that duelt in-to Housdaill, And Kyrkepatrik, was in that cumpany, And Halyday quhilk semblyt sturdely. Quhar thai entryt the sail?e was so sayr Dede to the ground feill frekis doun thai bayr. Vii scor, was haill off new cummyn men in deid, The south party off thaim had mekill dreid. Wallace was horssyt apon a cursour wicht At gud Corre had brocht in-to thar sycht. To stuff the chas with his new chewalry, He commaundyt Graym and all his men forthi To-gydder byd and folow as thai mycht. Thre capdanys thar full son to dede he dycht, That restyt hors so wondyr weill him bayr. Quhom he our-tuk agayn rais neuir mar. Raithly he raid and maid full mony wound. Thir thre Capdanis he stekit in that stound, Off Dursdeyr, Enoch and Tybyr mur. Lord Clyffurdis Eym away to Clyffurd fur, The quhilk befor that kepyt Lowchmaban. Na landyt man chapyt with him bot ane, For Maxwell als out off Carlauerok com, On to the Sotheroun the gaynest wayis nom. In-to the chas so wysely thai rid Few gat away that come apon that sid. Besyd Cokpull full feyll fechtyng thai fand. Sum drownyt was, sum slayn wpon the sand. Quha chapyt was in Ingland fled away. Wallace raturnd. Na presoner tuk thai. In Carlauerok restyng that nycht thai maid, Apon the morn tyll Drumfres blythly raid. Thar Wallace cryid quha wald cum till his pes Agayn Sotheroun thar malice for to ces. Till trew Scottis he ordand warysoun; Quha fawtyt had he grantyt remissioun. In Drumfres than he wald no langar byd. The Sotheroun fled off Scotland on Ilk sid, Be sey and land, with-out langar abaid. Off castellys, tounys, than Wallace chyftanys maid, Rewlyt the land and put It to gud rest With trew keparys the quhilk he traistyt best. The trew Douglace, that I ?ow tauld off ayr, Kepar was maid fra Drumlanryk till Ayr, Becaus he had on Sotheroun sic thing wrocht. Hys wyff was wraith, bot It scho schawit nocht, Wndyr cowart hyr malice hid perfyt, As a serpent watis hyr tym to byt. Till Dowglace eft scho wrocht full mekill cayr. Off that as now I leyff quhill forthirmar. Bot Sotheroun men durst her no castell hald, Bot left Scotland, befor as I ?ow tald, Saiff ane Morton, a capdane fers and fell That held Dunde. Thar Wallace wald nocht duell; Thiddyr he past and lappyt It about. Quhen Morton saw that he was in sic dout He askyt leyff with thar lywys to ga. Wallace denyit and said, “It beis nocht sa. The last Capdane off Ingland that her was, I gayff him leyff with his men for to pas. Thow sall forthink sic maistre for to mak. All Ingland sall of the exemple tak. Sic men I wend fra-thine for to haiff worn. Thow sall be hangyt, suppos thi king had suorn.” He gert commaund na Scottis suld to thaim spek: “Conferme the sege and so we sall ws wrek On Inglismen, has sic will off Dunde. Scrymiour he maid thar constable for to be. A ballingar off Ingland that was thar Past out of Tay and come to Quhitbe far; To London send and tauld off all this cace, Till hyng Morton wowyt had Wallace. Befor this tym Eduuard with power ?eid To wer on Frans, for than he had no dreid. Befor he trowyt Scotland suld be his awn. Quhen thai him warnyt how his men was ourthrawn, Agayn he turnyt till Ingland haistely And left his deid all fykit in-to fy. Gascone, he clemyt as in-to heretage, He left it thus for all his gret barnage; And Flandris als he thocht till tak on hand, And thir he left and come to reyff Scotland. Quhen that this king in Ingland was cummyn hame, Sowmoundis thai maid and chargyt Bruce be nayme And all wthir that leyffyt wndir his croun, Byschop, barroun, to cum at thar sowmoun. Quhen Wallace twys throw grace had fred Scotland This tyran king tuk playnly wpon hand. For sic desyr that he mycht haiff no rest He thocht till hym of It to mak conquest, In cowatice he had rongyng so lang. Chyftanis he maid; at thai suld nocht pas wrang Gydis thai chessyt fra strenthis thaim to ghy. Thai thocht no mor to byd at Iuperty. In playn battaill and thai mycht Wallace wyn He trowyt off wer thai wald no mor begyn. Lat I this king makand his ordinans; My purpos is to spek sum thing off Frans. The Inglismen, that Ghyan held at wer, Till Franch folk thai did full mekill der. King and consaill sone in thar wyttis kest; To get Wallace thai thocht it was the best. For Gyan land the Inglismen had thai Thai schup thaim thus in all the haist thai may; For thai traistyt and Scotland war weill stad Wallace wald cum, as he thaim promyst had. The sammyn harrald befor in Scotland was, Thai him commaundyt and ordand he suld pas In-to Scotland, with-out langar delay, Out off the Slus als gudly as he may. Redy he was, in schip he went on cace. In Tayis mowth the hawyn but baid he has, Quhar Wallace was than at the sayl?e still, And he rasawyt the harrold with gud will. Thar wryt he red and said him on this wys, Ane ansuer sone he couth thaim nocht dewys. Till honest In the harrold than he send On Wallace cost rycht boundandly to spend, Quhyll tym he saw how othir materis ?eid. Ane ansuer he suld hawe with-outyn dreid. The wyt off Frans thocht Wallace to commend. In-to Scotland with this harrold thai send Part off his deid, and als the discripcioune Off him tane thar be men off discrecioun, Clerkis, knychtis and harroldys that him saw, Bot I heroff can nocht rehers thaim aw. Wallace statur, off gretnes and off hycht, Was Iugyt thus be discrecioun off rycht, That saw him bath dischevill and in weid. Ix quartaris large he was in lenth indeid. Thryd part that lenth in schuldrys braid was he, Rycht sembly, strang and lusty for to se; Hys lymmys gret, with stalwart pais and sound, Hys brawnys hard, his armes lang and round; His handis maid rycht lik till a pawmer, Off manlik mak, with nales gret and cler. Proporcionyt lang and fair was his wesage, Rycht sad off spech and abill in curage; Braid breyst and heych, with sturdy crag and gret; His lyppys round, his noys was squar and tret; Bowand bron haryt on browis and breis lycht, Cler aspre Eyn lik dyamondis brycht. Wndyr the chyn, on the left sid, was seyn Be hurt a wain; his colour was sangweyn. Woundis he had in mony diuers place, Bot fair and weill kepyt was his face. Off Ryches he kepyt no propyr thing, Gaiff as he wan, lik Alexander the king. In tym off pes mek as a maid was he; Quhar wer approchyt the rycht Ector was he. To Scottis men a gret credens he gaiff, Bot knawin Enemys, thai couth him nocht disayff. Thir properteys was knawin in-to Frans Off him to be a gud Remembrans. Maister Ihon Blayr that patron couth rasaiff, In Wallace buk brewyt It with the layff. Bot he her-off as than tuk litill heid, His lauborous mynd was all on othir deid. At Dunde sege thus ernystfully thai lay. Tithandis to him Iop brocht apon a day, How Eduuard king with likly men to waill, A hundyr thowsand, com for to assaill; Than Scotland ground thai had tane apon cace. In-to sum-part It grewyt gud Wallace. He maid Scrymiour still at the hous to ly With ii thousand and chargyt him forthi, That nayn suld chaip with lyff out off that sted At Sotheroun war, bot do thaim all to ded. Scrymgeour grantyt rycht faithfully to bid. With viii thousand Wallace couth fra him ryd To Sanct Ihonstoun; iiii dayis he graithit him thar, With sad awys towart the south can fayr; For king Eduuard that tym ordand had X thousand haill to pas, at was full glad, With ?ong Wodstok, a lord off mekill mycht. At Sterlyng bryg he ordand thaim full rycht And thar to byd the entre for to wer. Off Wallace than he trowit to haiff no der. Thar leyff thai laucht and past but delay, Rycht saraly and in a gud aray; To Sterlyng com and wald nocht thar abid. To se the northland furth than can he ryd, Sic new curage so fell in his entent, Quhilk maid Sotheroun full sar for to repent. BOOK XI This Wodstok raid in-to the north gud speid. Off Scottis as than he had bot litill dreid, For weyll he trowyt for to reskew Dunde. Thar schippys com to Tay In be the se. His gydys said thai suld him gyd in by Saynct Ihonstoun, quhar passage was playnly. The hycht thai tuk and lukit thaim about; So war thai war off Wallace and his rout. In sum-part than he remordyt his thocht, The kingis commaund becaus he kepyt nocht, Bot quhen he saw thai war fewar than he He wald thaim byd and othir do or de. Schyr Ihon Ramsay formest his power saw. He said, “?on is, that ?he se hydder draw, Othir Sotheroun that cummys sa cruellye Or ellis Erll Malcom to sek ?ow for supple.” Than Wallace smyld and said, “Inglis thai ar, ?e may thaim ken rycht weyll quhar euir thai far.” On Schyrreff mur Wallace the feild has tane With viii thousand that worthy was in wane. The Sotheroun was rycht douchty in thar deid, To-gydder straik, weyll stuffyt in steyll weid. Than speris sone all in-to splendrys sprent. The hardy Scottis throw-out the Sotheroun went. In reddy battaill vii thowsand doun thai bar, Dede on the bent, that recoueryt neuir mar. Wyth fell fechtyng off wapynnys groundyn keyn Blud fra byrneis was bruschyt on the greyn. The felloun stour, that awfull was and strang! The worthy Scottis so derfly on thaim dang At all was dede within a litill stound. Nane off that place had power for to found. ?ong Wodstok has bathe land and lyff forlorn. The Scottis spul?eit off gud ger thaim beforn. Quhat thaim thocht best off fyn harnes thai waill, Bath gold and gud and hors that mycht thaim waill. To Styrlyng bryg with-out restyng thai raid. Or ma suld com Wallace this ordinans maid. Past our the bryg Wallace gert wrychtis call, Hewyt trastis, wndyd the passage all. Sa tha sam folk he send to the Drip furd, Gert set the ground with scharp spykis off burd; Bot ix or x he kest a gait befor, Langis the schauld, maid it bath dep and schor. Than Wallace said, “On a sid we sall be, ?on king and I, bot gyff he southwart fle.” He send Lawder, quhilk had in hand the Bas, Langis the cost quhar ony weschell was, And men with him that wysly couth luk Off Ilka boyt a burd or two out tuk. Schippys thai brynt off strangearis that was thar. Cetoun and he to Wallace thus thai fayr, In Styrlying lay apon his purpos still For Inglismen to se quhat way thai will. The Erll Malcom, Styrlyng in kepyng had, Till him he com with men off armes sad, Thre hundreth haill that sekyr war and trew Off Lennox folk, thar power to renew. Schir Iohn the Graym fra Dundaff prewaly Till Wallace com with a gud chewalry, Tithandis him brocht, the Sotheroun com at hand. In Torfychan king Eduuard was lugeand, Stroyand the place off purwiance that was thar. Sanct Ihonys gud for thaim thai wald nocht spar. The gud Stewart of But com to the land. With him he ledys weill ma than xii thowsand, Till Cumyn past, was than in Cummyrnald. Apon the morn bownyt the Stewart bald Sone till aray with men off armes brycht. Xx?? thowsand than semblyt to thar sycht. The lord Stwart and Cumyn furth thai rid To the Fawkyrk and thar hecht to abid. The Scottis chyftane than owt off Styrlyng past. To the Fawkyrk he sped his ost full fast. Wallace and his than till aray he ?eid With x thousand off douchty men in deid. Quha couth behald thar awfull, lordly wult, So weill beseyn, so forthwart, stern and stult, So gud chyftanys as with sa few thar beyn, With-out a king was neuir in Scotland seyn: Wallace him selff and Erll Malcom that lord, Schir Ihon the Graym and Ramsay at accord, Cetoun, Lawder and Lundy that was wicht, Adam Wallace, to that Iornay him dycht, And mony gud quhilk prewyt weill in pres. Thar namys all I may nocht her rehres. Sotheroun or than out off Torfychan fur, Thar passage maid in-to Slamanan mur; In-till a playn set tentis and pal?on, South-hald Fawkyrk, a litill abon the ton. Gud Iop him selff Iugit thaim be his sycht In haill nowmyr a hundyr thousand rycht. Off Wallace com the Scottis sic comfort tuk, Quhen thai him saw all raddour thai forsuk, For off Inwy was few thar at It wyst. Tresonable folk thar mater wyrkis throu lyst Poyson sen syn ‘at the Fawkyrk’ is cald, Throu treson and corrupcion off ald. Lord Cumyn had Inwy at gud Wallace. For Erll Patrik that hapnyt apon cace; Cunttas off Merch was Cumyns sistyr der. Wndyr colour he wrocht in this maner, In-to the ost had ordand Wallace dede And maid Stewart with him to fall in pled. He said that lord at Wallace had no rycht Power to leid and he present in sycht. He bad him tak the wantgard for to gy. So wyst he weyll at thai suld stryff forthi. Lord Stewart ast at Wallace his consaill, Said, “Schir, ?e knaw quhat may ws maist awaill. ?on felloun king is awfull for to bid.” Rycht wnabasyt Wallace ansuerd that tyd: “And I haiff seyn may twys in-to Scotland Wyth ?on Ilk king, quhen Scottis men tuk on hand; Wyth fewar men than now ar hydder socht This Realm agayn to full gud purpos brocht. Schyr, we will fecht, for we haiff men Inew As for a day, sa that we be all trew.” The Stewart said he wald the wantgard haiff. Wallace ansuerd and said, “Sa god me saiff, That sall ?e nocht als lang as I may ryng, Nor no man ellis quhill I se my rycht king. Gyff he will cum and tak on him the croun At his commaund I sall be reddy boun. Throw goddis grace I reskewed Scotland twys. I war to mad to leyff it on sic wys, To tyn for bost that I haiff gowernd lang.” Thus halff in wraith frawart him can he gang. Stewart tharwith all bolnyt in-to baill. “Wallace,” he said, “be the I tell a taill.” “Say furth,” quod he, “off the fairest ?e can.” Wnhappyly his taill thus he began. “Wallace,” he said, “thow takis the mekill cur. So feryt it be wyrkyng off natur, How a howlat complend off his fethrame, Quhill Deym Natur tuk off ilk byrd but blame A fayr fethyr and to the howlat gaiff. Than he throuch pryd reboytyt all the layff. Quhar-off suld thow thi sen?e schaw so he? Thow thinkis nan her at suld thi falow be. This makis it thow art cled with our men. Had we our awn thin war bot few to ken.” At thir wordis gud Wallace brynt as fyr. Our haistely he ansuerd him in Ire. “Thow leid,” he said. “The suth full oft has ben, Thar haif I biddyn quhar thow durst nocht be seyn, Contrar Enemys, na mar for Scotlandis rycht Than dar the howlat quhen that the day is brycht! That taill full meit thow has tauld be thi sell. To thi desyr thow sall me nocht compell. Cwmyn it is has gyffyn this consaill. Will God, ?e sall off ?our fyrst purpos faill. That fals traytour that I off danger brocht Is wondyr lyk till bryng this Realm till nocht. For thi ogart othir thow sall de, Or in presoun byd, or cowart lik to fle. Reskew off me thow sall get nane this day.” Tharwith he turnd and fra thaim raid his way. X thousand haill fra thaim with Wallace raid. Nan was bettyr in all this warld so braid As off sic men at leiffand was in lyff. Allace, gret harm fell Scotland throuch that stryff! Past till a wod fra the Fawkyrk be est. He wald nocht byd for commaund na request, For charge off nan bot It had ben his king, At mycht that tym bryng him fra his etlyng. The tothir Scottis that saw this discensioun For dysconford to leiff the feild was boun, Bot at thai men was natyff till Stwart, Principaill off But, tuk hardement in hart. Lord Stwart was at Cumyn grewyt thar, Hecht and he leiffd, he suld repent full sar The gret trespace that he throw raklesnace Had gert him mak to Wallace in that place. For thair debait it was a gret pete. For Inglismen than mycht na trete be, Haistyt sa fast a battaill to the feild, Xxx?? thowsand that weill coud wapynnys weild. Erll off Harfurd was chosyn thar chyftane. The gud Stewart than till aray is gane. The feild he tuk as trew and worthy knycht. The Inglismen come on wyth full gret mycht. Thar fell metyng was awfull for to se. At that countour thai gert feill Sotheroun de, Quhen speris was spilt hynt owt with suerdis son. On athir sid full douchty deid was don.

Xx?? thowsand with dredfull wapynnys dycht Off Sotheroun men derffly to ded thai dyng. The ramanand agayn fled to thar king. X thousand thar that fra the ded eschewyt With thar chyftane In-to the ost relewyt. Agayn to ray the hardy Stwart ?eid. Quhen Wallace saw this nobill, worthi deid, Held wp his handys with humyll prayer prest. “O god,” he said, “gyff ?on lord grace to lest, And power haiff his worschip till attend, To wyn thir folk and tak the haill commend. Gret harm it war at he suld be ourset! With new power thai will on him rebet.” Be that the Bruce ane awfull battaill baid, And Byschop Beik quhilk oft had been assayd, Xl thowsand apon the Scottis to fair. With fell affer thai raissit wp rycht thair The Bruce baner, in gold off gowlis cler. Quhen Wallace saw battallis approchyt ner, The rycht lyon agayn his awn kynryk, “Allace,” he said, “the warld is contrar-lik! This land suld be ?on tyrandis heretage, That cummys thus to stroy his awn barnage. Sa I war fre off it that I said ayr, I wald forswer Scotland for euirmar! Contrar the Bruce I suld reskew thaim now Or de tharfor, to god I mak a wow.” The gret debait in Wallace wit can waid Betwix kyndnes and wyllfull wow he maid. Kyndnes him bad reskew thaim fra thar fa. Than wyll said, “Nay. Quhy, fuyll, wald thow do sa? Thow has na wyt wyth rycht thi selff to leid. Suld thow help thaim that wald put the to deid?” Kyndnes said, “?ha, thai ar gud Scottis men.” Than will said, “Nay, weryte thow may ken, Had thai bene gud all anys we had ben; Be reson heyr the contrar now is seyn, For thai me hayt mar na the Sotheroun leid.” Kyndnes said, “Nay, that schaw thai nocht in deid. Thocht ane off thaim be fals in-till his saw, For caus off him thow suld nocht los thaim aw. Thai haiff done weill in-to ?on felloun stour. Reskew thaim now and tak a hye honour.” Wyll said, “Thai wald haiff reft fra me my lyff. I baid for thaim in mony stalwart stryff.” Kyndnes said, “Help, thar power is at nocht; Syn wreik on hym that all the malice wrocht.” Wyll said, “This day thai sall nocht helpyt be. That I haiff said sall ay be said for me! Thai ar bot dede. God grant thaim off his blys. Inwy lang syn has done gret harme bot this.” Wallace tharwith turnyt for Ire in teyn, Braith teris for baill byrst out fra bathe his Eyn. Schyr Ihon the Graym and mony worthi wicht Wepyt in wo for sorow off that sycht. Quhen Bruce his battaill apon the Scottis straik, Thar cruell com maid cowardis for to quaik. Lord Cwmyn fled to Cummyrnauld away. About the Scottis the Sotheroun lappyt thay. The men off But befor thar lord thai stud Defendand him, quhen fell stremys off blud Wer thaim about in flothis quhar thai ?eid. Bathid in blud was Bruce suerd and his weid Throw fell slauchtyr off trew men off his awn. Son to the dede the Scottis was ourthrawn; Syn slew the lord, for he wald nocht be tayn. Quhen Wallace saw that thir gud men was gayn, “Lordis,” he said, “quhat now is ?our consaill? Twa choys thar is, the best I rede ws waill: ?ondyr the king his ost abandonand, Heyr Bruce and Beyk in ?on battaill to stand. ?on king in wer has wys and felloun beyn.

Gud Wallace than, that stoutly couth thaim ster, Befor thaim raid in-till his armour cler, Rewellyt speris all in a nowmyr round: “And we hawe grace for to pas throw thaim sound, And few be lost, till our strenth we will ryd.

The king criyt hors apon thaim for to ryd, Bot this wys lord gaiff him consaill to bid: The Erll off ?ork said, “Schir, ?e wyrk amys To brek aray. ?on men quyt throuch thaim is. Thai ken the land and will to strenthis draw. Tak we the playn we are in perell aw.” The king consawyt at his consaill was rycht, Rewllyt his ost and baid still in thar sycht. Or Bruce and Beik mycht retorn thar battaill The Scottis was throuch and had a gret awaill. Wallace commaund the ost suld pas thar way To the Tor wod in all the haist thai may. Hym selff and Graym and Lawder turnyt In Betwex battaillys prys prowys for to wyn; And with thaim baid in that place hundrethis thre Off westland men, was oysyt in ieperte, Apon wycht hors that wesele coud ryd.

Xx?? thowsand he rewllyt be force and wit Wpon the Scottis his men for to reskew. Serwyt thai war with gud speris enew, And byschop Beik a stuff till him to be. Quhen gud Wallace thar ordinans coud se, “Allace,” he said, “?on man has mekill mycht And our gud will till wndo his awn rycht.” He bad his men towart his ost in rid; Thaim for to sayff he wald behynd thaim byd. Mekill he trowys in god and his awn weid. Till sayff his men he did full douchty deid. Wpon him selff mekill trawaill he tais. The gret battaill compleit apon him gais. In the forbreyst he retornyt full oft. Quham euir he hyt thar sawchnyng was wnsoft. That day in warld knawin was nocht his maik. A Sotheroun man he slew ay at a straik. Bot his a strenth mycht nocht agayn thaim be; Towart his ost behwffyd for to fle. The Bruce him hurt at the returnyng thair, Wndyr the hals a deip wound and a sayr. Blude byrstyt owt braithly at speris lenth. Fra the gret ost he fled towart his strenth. Sic a flear befor was neuir seyn! Nocht at Gadderis off Gawdyfer the keyn Quhen Alexander reskewed the foryouris, Mycht tyll him be comperd in tha houris: The fell turnyng on folowaris that he maid, How bandounly befor the ost he raid; Nor how gud Graym wyth cruell hardement, Na how Lawder, amang thar fayis went; How thaim allayn in-to that stour thai stud Quhill Wallace was in stanchyng off his blud. Be than he had stemmyt full weill his wound, With three hundreth in-to the feild can found To reskew Graym and Lawder that was wicht; Bot byschop Beik com with sic force and slycht The worthy Scottis reryt fer on bak, Sewyn akyrbreid in turnyng off thar bak. ?eit Wallace has thir twa delyueryt weill Be his awn strenth and his gud suerd of steill. The awfull Bruce amang thaim with gret mayn, At the reskew iii Scottis men he has slayn. Quham he hyt rycht ay at a straik was ded. Wallace preyst In tharfor to set Rameid. With a gud sper the Bruce was serwyt but baid. With gret Inwy to Wallace fast he raid And he till him asson?eit nocht for-thi. The Bruce him myssyt as Wallace passyt by. Awkwart he straik with his scharp groundyn glawe; Sper and horscrag in-till sondyr he drave. Bruce was at erd or Wallace turned about. The gret battaill off thousandis stern and stout, Thai horssyt Bruce, with men off gret walour. Wallace allayn was in that stalwart stour. Graym pressyt in and straik ane Inglis knycht Befor the Bruce apon the basnet brycht. That seruall stuff and all his othir weid, Bathe bayn and brayn, the nobill suerd throuch ?eid. The knycht was dede. Gud Graym retornet tyte. A suttell knycht tharat had gret despyt, Folowyt at wait and has persawyt weill Gramys byrny was to narow sumdeill, Be-neth the waist that clos it mycht nocht be. On the fyllat full sternly straik that sle, Persyt the bak, in the bowalys him bar Wyth a scharp sper, that he mycht leiff no mar. Graym turnd tharwith and smate that knycht in teyn Towart the wesar, a litill be-neth the Eyn. Dede of that dynt to ground he duschyt doun. Schyr Ihon the Graym, that swonyt on his arsoun, Or he our-com till pas till his party, Feill Sotheroun men that was on fute him by Stekit his hors, that he no forthyr ?eid. Graym ?auld to god his gud speryt and his deid. Quhen Wallace saw this knycht to dede was wrocht, The pytuous payn so sor thyrllyt his thocht All out off kynd it alteryt his curage. His wyt in wer was than bot a wod rage. Hys hors him bur in feild quhar-so him lyst, For off him selff as than litill he wyst. Lik a wyld best that war fra reson rent, As wytlace wy, in-to the ost he went Dingand on hard. Quhat Sotheroun he rycht hyt Straucht apon hors agayn mycht neuir syt. In-to that rage full feill folk he dang doun. All hym about was reddyt a gret rowm. Quhen Bruce persawyt with Wallace it stud sa, He chargyt men lang sperys for to ta And sla hys hors, sa he suld nocht eschaip. Feyll Sotheroun than to Wallace fast can schaip, Persyt hys hors wyth sperys on athir syd. Woundys thai maid that was bathe deip and wyd. Off schafftis part Wallace in sondyr schayr, Bot fell hedys in-till his hors left thair. Sum wytt agayn to Wallace can radoun. In hys awn mynd so rewllyt him resoun, Sa for to de him thocht it no waslage. Than for to fle he tuk no taryage, Spuryt the hors, quhilk ran in a gud randoun Till his awn folk, was bydand on Carroun. The sey was In, at thai stoppyt and stud. On loud he criyt and bad thaim tak the flud, “To-gydder byd, ?e may nocht los a man.” At his commaund the watter thai tuk than; Hym returned the entre for to kepe, Quhill all his ost was passyt our the depe; Syn folowit fast and dred his hors suld faill, Hym selff hewy, cled in-to plait off maill. Set he couth swom he trowit he mycht nocht weill. The cler watter culyt the hors sumdeill. Atour the flud he bur him to the land, Syn fell doun dede and mycht no langar stand. Kerle full son a cursour till him brocht. Than wp he lap, amang the ost he socht. Graym was away and xv othir wicht. On Magdaleyn day thir folk to ded was dycht. Xxx?? thousand off Inglismen for trew The worthy Scottis apon that day thai slew, Quhat be Stwart and syn be wicht Wallace. For all his prys king Eduuard rewyt that race. To the Tor wod he bad the ost suld ryd. Kerle and he past wpon Caroun syd, Behaldand our apon the south party. Bruce formast com and can on Wallace cry, “Quhat art thow thar?” “A man,” Wallace can say. The Bruce ansuerd, “That has thow prewyt to-day. Abyd,” he said, “thow nedis nocht now to fle.” Wallace ansuerd, “I eschew nocht for the Bot that power, has thi awn ner fordon. Amendis off this, will god, we sall haiff son.” “Langage off the,” the Bruce said, “I desyr.” “Say furth,” quod he; “thow may for litill hyr. Ryd fra that ost and gar thaim bid with Beik. I wald fayn her quhat thow likis to speik.” The ost baid styll, the Bruce passyt thaim fra. He tuk wyth him bot a Scot that hecht Ra. Quhen that the Bruce out off thar heryng wer, He turned in and this question can sper, “Quhy wyrkis thow thus and mycht in gud pes be?” Than Wallace said, “Bot in defawt of the, Throuch thi falsheid thin awn wyt has myskend. I cleym no rycht bot wald this land defend, At thow wndoys throu thi fals cruell deid. Thow has tynt twa, had beyn worth fer mair meid On this ilk day with a gud king to found, Na v myl?on off fynest gold so round That euir was wrocht in werk or ymage brycht! I trow in warld was nocht a bettir knycht Than was the gud Graym off trewth and hardement.” Teris tharwith fra Wallace eyn doun went. Bruce said, “Fer ma on this day we haiff losyt.” Wallace ansuerd, “Allace, thai war ewill cosyt, Throuch thi tresson, that suld be our rycht king, That willfully dystroyis thin awn off-spryng.” The Bruce askyt, “Will thow do my dewys?” Wallace said, “Nay, thow leyffis in sic wys Thow wald me mak at Eduuardis will to be. ?eit had I leuir to-morn be hyngyt hye!” “?eit sall I say as I wald consaill geyff, Than as a lord thow mycht at liking leiff, At thin awn will in Scotland for to Ryng And be in pece and hald off Eduuard king.” “Off that fals king I think neuir wage to tak Bot contrar him with my power to mak. I cleym no thing as be titill off rycht, Thocht I mycht reiff, sen god has lent me mycht, Fra the thi crowne off this regioun to wer, Bot I will nocht sic a charge on me ber. Gret god wait best quhat wer I tak on hand For till kep fre that thow art gaynstandand. It mycht beyn said off lang gone her off forn, In cursyt tym thow was for Scotland born.

Pagans till ws dois nocht so mekill der.” Than lewch the Bruce at Wallace ernystfulnas And said, “Thow seis at thus standis the cas, This day thow art with our power our-set. Agayn ?on king warrand thow may mocht get.” Than Wallace said, “We ar be mekill thing Starkar this day in-contrar off ?on king, Than at Beggar, quhar he left mony off his And als the feild. So sall he do with this Or de thar-for, for all his mekill mycht. We haiff nocht losyt in this feild bot a knycht, And Scotland now in sic perell is stad To leyff it thus my selff mycht be full mad.” “Wallace,” he said, “it prochys ner the nycht. Wald thow to-morn, quhen at the day is lycht, Or nyn off bell, meit me at this chapell Be Dunypas? I wald haiff ?our consell.” Wallace said, “Nay, or that Ilk tyme be went, War all the men hyn till the orient In-till a will with Eduuard, quha had suorn, We sall bargane be ix houris to-morn; And for his wrang reyff othir he sall think scham, Or de tharfor, or fle in Ingland haym. Bot and thow will, son be the hour off thre At that Ilk tryst, will God, thow sall me se. Quhill I may lest this Realm sall nocht forfar.” Bruce promest hym with xii Scottis to be thar, And Wallace said, “Stud thow rychtwys to me, Cowntir-palys I suld nocht be to the. I sall bryng x, and for thi nowmer ma I gyff no force thocht thow be freynd or fa.” Thus thai departyt. The Bruce past his way, Till Lithqwo raid quhar that king Edduard lay, The feild had left and lugyt be-south the toun, To souper set as Bruce at the pal?oun So entryt In and saw wacand his seit. No wattir he tuk bot maid him to the meit. Fastand he was and had beyn in gret dreid. Bludyt was all his wapynnys and his weid. Sotheroun lordys scornyt him in termys rud. Ane said, “Behald, ?on Scot ettis his awn blud.” The king thocht Ill thai maid sic derisioun. He bad haiff watter to Bruce off Huntyntoun. Thai bad hym wesche. He said that wald he nocht: “This blud is myn. That hurtis most my thocht.” Sadly the Bruce than in his mind remordyt Thai wordis suth Wallace had him recordyt. Than rewyt he sar, fra resoun had him knawin At blud and land suld all lik beyn his awin. With thaim he was lang or he couth get away, Bot contrar Scottis he faucht nocht fra that day. Lat I the Bruce sayr mowyt in his entent. Gud Wallace sone agane to the ost went, In the Torwod quhilk had thar lugyng maid. Fyris thai bett that was bath brycht and braid. Off nolt and scheip thai tuk at sufficiens. Tharoff full sone thai get thaim sustinens. Wallace slepyt bot a schort quhill and rais. To rewll the ost on a gud mak he gais. Till Erll Malcom, Ramsay and Lundy wicht, With v thousand in a battaill thaim dycht. Wallace, Lawder and Crystell off Cetoun V thousand led, and Wallace off Ricardtoun. Full weyll arayit in-till thar armour clen Past to the feild quhar that the chas had ben, Amang the ded men sekand the worthiast, The cors off Graym for quham he murned mast. Quhen thai him fand and gud Wallace him saw, He lychtyt doun and hynt him fra thaim aw, In armys vp, behaldand his paill face. He kyssyt him and criyt full oft, “Allace! My best brothir in warld that euir I had, My a-fald freynd quhen I was hardest stad, My hop, my heill thow was, in maist honour, My faith, my help, my strenthiast in stour.

Thow was gret caus off wynnyng off Scotland, Thocht I began and tuk the wer on hand. I wow to God that has the warld in wauld, Thi dede sall be to Sotheroun full der sauld!

Thai caryit him with worschip and dolour, In the Fawkyrk graithit him in sepultour. Wallace commaundyt his ost thar for to byd. Hys x he tuk, for to meit Bruce thai ryd. Sowthwest he past quhar at the tryst was set. The Bruce full sone and gud Wallace is met. For los off Graym and als for propyr teyn He grew In Ire quhen he the Bruce had seyn. Thar salusyng was bot boustous and thrawin. “Rewis thow,” he said, “thow art contrar thin awin?” “Wallace,” said Bruce, “rabut me now no mar. Myn awin dedis has bet me wondyr sar.” Quhen Wallace hard with Bruce that It stud sua On kneis he fell, far contenans can him ma. In armes son the Bruce has Wallace tane. Out fra thar men in consalle ar thai gane. I can nocht tell perfytly thar langage, Bot this was it thar men had off knawlage. Wallace him prayt, “Cum fra ?on Sotheroun king.” The Bruce said, “Nay, thar lattis me a thing. I am so boundyn with wytnes to be leill, For all Ingland I wald nocht fals my seill. Bot off a thing I hecht to god and the, That contrar Scottis agayn I sall nocht be. In-till a feild with wapynnys that I ber In thi purpos I sall the neuir der.

Brek he on me quhen that my terme is out, I cum to the. May I chaip fra that dout!” Off thar consaill I can tell ?ow no mar. The Bruce tuk leyff and can till Eduuard fayr, Rycht sad in mynd for Scottis men that war lost. Wallace in haist prouidyt son his ost. He maid Crawfurd the Erll Malcom to gid. The lauch way till Enrawyn thai ryd, For thar wachis than suld thaim nocht aspy. The tothir ost him selff led haistely Be-south Manwell, quhilk that thai war betweyn. Off the out wach thus chapyt thai wnseyn. The Erll Malcom on Lithquow entris In. Our haistely a stryff thai can begyn. Wallace was nocht all to the battaill boun. Quhen that thai hard the scry rais in the toun On Eduuardis ost thai set full sodandly. Wallace and his maid litill noyis or cry Bot occupyd with wapynnys in that stour. Feill fallen war ded that was with-out armour. All dysarayit the Inglis ost was than; Amang pal?ounis the Scottis, quhar mony man Cuttyt cordys, gart mony tentis fall.

M in armys him about In-to harnes had biddyn all that nycht; Bot frayt folk, so dulfully was dycht, On Ilk sid fled for ferdnes off thar deid, Wallace and his so rudly throw thaim ?eid Towart the king and fellyt feill to grounde. Quha baid thaim thar rycht fell fechtyng has found. That awfull kyng rycht manfully abaid. Till all his folk a gret comford he maid. The worthy Scottis agayn him in that stour Feill Sotheroun slew in-to thar fyn armour; So forthwartlye thai pressyt in the thrang, Befor the king maid sloppis thaim amang. Inglis commounis than fled on athir sid; Bot noble men, nane othir durst abid. The Bruce as than to Scottis did no grewans, A Iuge he was with fen?eid contenans; Sa did he neuir into na battaill ayr, Nothyr ?eit eftir, sic deid as he schew thar. The Erll Malcom be than in-to the toun The Erll Herfurd to fle thai had maid boun; The Lennox men set thar lugyng in fyr. Then ferdly fled full mony Sotheroun syr. The king Eduuard that ?eit was fechtand still Has seyn thaim fle; that likit him full Ill. The worthi Scottis fast towart him thai pres, Hys brydyll ner assayit ar thai wald ces. His banerman Wallace slew in that place And sone to ground the baner doun he race. The Erll off ?ork consaillyt the king to fle. Than he ratornd, sen na succour thai se. The Inglismen, has seyn thair banner fall, With-out comfort to fle thai purpost all. Xi M in toun and feild was ded Off Eduuardis folk or his selff left the sted. Xxty thousand away to-giddyr raid. King and chyftans na langar tary maid. The Scottis in haist than to thar hors thai ?eid To stuff the chas with worthi men in weid. The Lennox folk that wantyt hors and ger Tuk thaim at wyll to help thaim in that wer. At stragyll raid quhat Scot mycht formest pas, Off Sotheroun men quhar-off gret slauchtyr was. Wallace has seyn the Scottis wnordourly Folow the chas; he maid chyftanis in hy Thaim for to rewll and all to-gyddyr ryd, Comaundyt thaim Ilkane suld othir bid: “In-to fleyng the Sotheroun suttaill ar. Se thai the tym, thai wyll set on ws sar. Feill scalyt folk to thaim will son Ranew, For ?e se weyll that thai ar men enew.” The folowaris was rewllyt weill with skill. In gud aray thai raid all at his will And slew doun fast; quhat Sotheroun thai ourtak Contrar the Scottis com neuir maistrice to mak. In-to the chais thai haistyt thaim so ner Na Inglisman out fra the ost durst ster. The frayit folk at stragill that was fleand Drew to the king, weill ma than x thousand. Xxx?? thousand in nowmyr than war thai, In-till aray to-gyddyr passyt away. Feill Scottis hors was drewyn in-to trawaill, Forrown that day, so Irkyt can defaill. The Sotheroun was with hors serwyt full weill. Off Wallace chais the lordis had gret feill. Off hors thai war purwaide in gret wayn. The king changyt on syndry hors off Spayn. Than Wallace said, “Lordis, ?e may weill se ?on folk ar now all at ?on king may be. For falt off stuff we lois our mekill thing. And we wyth hors to pas befoir this king We suld mak end off all this lang debait; ?eit sum off thaim sall handelyt be full hayt. Part off our hors ar haldyn fresch and wicht. Set on thaim sar quhill we are in this mycht.” Tharwith the Scottis so hard amang thaim drew Off the outward thre thousand thair thai slew. In Crawfurd mur mony man was slayn. Eduuard gart call the Bruce mekill off mayn. Than said he thus, “Gud Erll off Huntyntoun, ?e se the Scottis puttis feill to confusioun. Wald ?e wyth men agayn on thaim raleiff And mer thaim anys, I sall, quhill I may leiff, Low ?ow fer mar than ony othir knycht, And for all this sall put ?ow to ?our rycht.” Than said the Bruce, “Schyr, los me off my band. Than I sall turn, I hecht ?ow be my hand.” The king full son consideryt in his mynd, Quhen he hard Bruce ansuer him in sic kynd, Fra Inglismen that Brucis hart set is. Than kest he thus how he suld mend that mys, And so he dyd in Ingland at his will. Na Scottis man he leit with Bruce bid still, Bot quhar he past held him in subieccioun Off Inglismen, wndyr a gret bandoun. He turned nocht, na na mar langage maid. In raid battaill the king to Sulway raid With mekill payn, fast vpon Ingland cost. L M in that trawaill he lost. Quhen Wallace saw he chapyt was away, Vpon Annand agayn returnyt thai Till Edynburgh, with-outyn tary mor; Put In Crawfurd that Captane was befor. Off heretage he had in Mannuell land. Wallace commaund Ilk man suld hald in hand Thar awin office, as thai befor had had. Thus in gud pece Scotland with rycht he stad. On the x day to Sanct Ihonstoun he went, Semblyt Lordis, syn schawyt thaim his entent. Scrymgeour com, at than had woun Dunde. Wallace commaund that tym weill kepyt he. He sail?eid so quhill strang hungyr thaim draiff; Sa feblyst war, the hous till him thai gaiff. Thai wageours sone he put to confusioun, Syn brocht Mortoun to mak a conclusioun Befor Wallace, and son fra he him saw He gert hyng hym, for all king Eduuardis aw. Masons, minouris, with Scrymgeour furth he send, Kest doun Dunde and tharoff maid ane end. Wallace sadly, quhen thir dedis war don, The lordis he cald and his will schawit thaim son. “Gud men,” he said, “I was ?our gouernour. My mynd was set to do ?ow ay honour And for to bryng this Realm to rychtwysnas. For It I passit in mony paynfull place. To wyn our awin my selff I neuir spard. At the Fawkyrk thai ordand me Reward.

My office our her playnly I resing. I think no mar to tak on me sic thing. In France I will to wyn my leffyng thar, As now awysd, and her to cum no mar.” Lordis gaynstud, bot all thai helpyt nocht. For ony thar he did as him best thocht. Byschop Synclar was wesyd with seknas In-till Dunkell, and syn throu goddis grace He recoueryt quhen Wallace past away. Eftir the Bruce he lestyt mony day. Gud Wallace thus tuk leiff in Sanct Ihonstoun, Xviii with him, till Dunde maid him boun. Longaweill past that douchty was in deid. The barrounys sone off Brechyn with him ?eid. Twa brethir als with thar wncle thaim dycht, Symon Wallace and Richard that was wicht. Schir Thomas Gray, this preist, can wyth thaim fair, Eduuard Litill, gud Iop and maister Blayr.

Thai saylyt furth by part off Ingland schor. Till Hwmbyr mowth quhen at thai com befor Out off the south a gret rede saile thai se, In-to thar top the leopardis standand hye. The merchandis than, that sen?e quhen thai saw Cummand so neir, thai war discumfyt aw, For weill thai wyst that It was Ihon off Lyn. Scottis to slay he said it was no syn. Thir frayit folk ?eid son to confessioun. Than Wallace said, “Off sic deuocioun ?eit saw I neuir in no place quhar I past. For this a schip me think ?ow all agast. ?on wood cattis sall do ws litill der. We saw thaim faill twys in a grettar wer, On a fair feild, so sall thai on the se. Dyspyt it Is to se thaim stand so hye.” The ster man said, “Schir, will ?e wndirstand, He saiffis nane that is born off Scotland. We may nocht fle fra ?on barge, wait I weill. Weyll stuft thai ar with gwn and gan?e off steill. Apon the se ?on rewar lang has beyn. Till rychtwys men he dois full mekill teyn. Mycht we be saiff it forst nocht off our gud. This wys he has, in schort for to conclud: A flud he beris apon his cot armour, Ay drownand folk, so payntyt in figour. Suppos we murn ?e suld haiff no merwaill.” Than Wallace said, “Her is men off mar waill To saill thi schip, tharfor in holl thow ga And thi feris. Na mar cummyr ws ma.” Wallace and his than sone till harnes ?eid. Quhen thai war graithit in-to thar worthi weid, Him selff and Blayr and the knycht Longaweill, Thir thre has tane to kepe the myd-schip weill. Befor was vii and vi be-eft was kend, Syn twa he chesd the top for to defend, And Gray he maid thar sterman for to be. The merchandis than, saw thaim sa manfulle To fend thaim selff, be caus thai had no weid Out off the holl thai tuk skynnys gud speid; Ay betwix two stuft woll as thai mycht best, Agayn the straik at thai suld sumpart lest. Than Wallace lewch and commendyt thaim aw. Off sic harnes befor he neuir saw. Be than the barge com on thaim wondyr fast, Vii scor in hyr that was no thing agast. Quhen Ihon off Lyn saw thaim in armour brycht He lewch and said thir haltyn wordis on hycht: “?on glakyt Scottis can ws nocht wndyrstand. Fulys thai ar, is new cummyn off the land.” He cryit, “Stryk!” bot no ansuer thai maid. Blayr with a bow schot fast with-outyn baid. Or thai clyppyt he schot bot arowis thre And at Ilk schot he gert a rewar de. The brygandis than, thai bykerit wondyr fast Amang the Scottis with schot and gownnys cast, And thai agayn with speris hedyt weill Feill woundis maid throuch plattis off fyne steill. Athir othir festnyt with clippys keyn. A cruell cowntyr thar was on schipburd seyn. The derff schot draiff as thik as a haill schour, Contende tharwith the space ner off ane hour. Quhen schot was gayn the Scottis gret comfort had. At hand strakys thai war sekyr and sad. The merchandis als, with sic thing as thai mycht, Prewyt full weill in defens off thar rycht. Wallace and his at ner strakis quhen thai be, With scharp swerdys thai gert feill brygandis de. Thai in the top so worthi wrocht with hand In the south top thar mycht no rewar stand. All the mydschip off rewers was maid waist, That to geiff our thai war in poynt almaist. Than Ihon off Lyn was rycht gretly agast. He saw his folk fail?e about him fast. With egyr will he wald haiff beyn away, Bad wynd the saill in all the haist thai may, Bot fra the Scottis thai mycht nocht than off skey, The clyp so sar on athir burd thai wey. Thai saw nothing that mycht be to thaim es. Crawfurd on loft thar saill brynt in a bles. Or Ihon off Lyn schup for to leyff that sted Off his best men saxte was brocht to ded. Thar schip by owris a burd was mar off hycht. Wallace lap In amang thai rewaris wicht. A man he straik our-burd in-to the Se. On the our-loft he slew son othir thre. Longaweill entryt and als the maister Blair; Thai gaiff no gyrth to frek at thai fand thar. Wallas him self with Ihon off Lyn was met. At his coler a felloun straik he set; Bathe helm and hed fra the schuldris he draiff. Blayr our the burd in the se kest the layff Off his body, and all the remaynand Entryt and slew the brygandis at thai fand. The schip thai tuk, gret gold and othir ger At thai reiffaris had gaderyt lang in wer. Bot maister Blayr spak nothing off himsell, In deid off armes quhat awentur he fell. Schir Thomas Gray, was than preyst to Wallace, Put in the buk how than hapnyt this cace At Blayr was in, and mony worthi deid Off quhilk him selff had no plesance to reid. Wallace rewllyt the schip with his awin men And saillyt furth the rycht cours for to ken. In the Sloice hawyn quhill that thai entryt be The merchandys weill he kepyt in sawfte. Off gold and ger he tuk part at thai fand, Gaiff thaim the schip, syn passyt to the land; Throuch Flandrys raid vpon a gudly wys, Entryt in France and socht vp to Parys. The glaid tithing at to the king was brocht Off Wallace com, it comford all thar thocht. Thai trowyt be him to get redres off wrang The Sotheroun had in Gyane wrocht so lang. The perys off France was still at thar parlement. The king commaund, wyth trew and haill entent, Thai suld forse a lordschip to Wallace. The lordis all than dempt off this cace. For Gyane was all haill owt off thar hand Thai thocht It best for to geyff him that land. For weill thai trowyt he had so wrocht befor He suld it wyn or ellis de tharfor; Alsua off it thai mycht no profyt haiff. This was the caus to Wallace thai it gaiff. This decret son thai schawit to the king. Displessyd he was thai maid him sic a thing. Off Gyane thus quhen Wallace had a feill, No land, he said, likit him haiff so weill: “My chance is thus for to be ay in wer And Inglismen has done our Realm most der. It was weill knawin, my defens rychtwys thar; Rycht haiff I her, my comfort is the mar. I thank ?our lordis, maid sic reward to me. Thar purpos is I sall nocht ydill be.” The king bad him be duk off Gyan land. To that commaund Wallace was gaynstandand Be-caus that land was haly to conquace. He thocht to wyn erar throw goddis grace. Bot neuertheles the king had maid him knycht And gaiff him gold for to maynteine his mycht, Syn gaiff playn charge till his wermen off France Thai suld be haill at Wallace ordinance. And als off him he bad him armes tak. Wallace forsuk sic changyng for to mak: “Sen I began I bar the reid lyoun And thinkis to be ay trew man to that croun. I thank ?ow schir off this mychty reward. ?our gyft herfor sall nocht rycht lang be spard. I think to quyt sum part ?e kith on me In your seruice, or ellis tharfor to de.” Gud Wallace thocht his tym he wald nocht waist, On to the wer he graithit him in haist. All Scottis men that was in-to that land, Till him thai socht with thar fewte and band. Langaweill als a gret power can rais. In Wallace help this gud knycht glaidly gais. Ten thowsand haill off nobill men thai war, The braid baner off Scotland displayed thar. Thir wermen sone apon Gyane thai fwr, Brak byggyns doun quhilk had bene stark and stur. Sotheroun thai slew, agayn thaim maid debait. Braithly on breid thai rasyt fyris hait. Schynnoun thai tuk at Wallace fyrst had woun And slew all men off Sotheroun was thar foun. In-to that toun Wallace his duellyng maid. All thar about he wan the contre braid. The worthy duk, off Orliance was lord, Semblyt his folk in-till a gud accord. Xii thousand than he had in armour brycht And thocht to help gud Wallace in his rycht. Leyff I thaim thus, the duk and Wallace baithe, And spek sum-part how Scotland tuk gret scaithe. The fals Inwy, the wicked fell tresoun, Amang thaim selff brocht feill to confusioun. The knycht Wallang in Scotland maid repair; The fals Menteth, Schir Ihon, with-outyn mair Betwix thai twa was maid a prewa band. So on a day they met in-till Annand. Off the Leynhous schir Ihon had gret desyr. Schyr Amer hecht he suld it haiff in hyr Till hald in fe, and othir landis mo, Off king Eduuard, so he wald pas him to. Thus cordyt thai and syn to London went. Eduuard was glaid for to hald that poyntment. Menteth was thar bound man to that fals king, Till forthir him till Scotland in all thing; Syn passyt haym, and Wallang with him fur Quhill he was brocht agayn our Carleill mur. King Eduuard than in Ire and fers owtrage Be xxx?? dayis raissit his barnage, In Scotland past and thar na stoppyng fand, Na chyftane thar that durst agayn him stand, For Menteth tald thai thocht to mak Bruce king. All trew Scottis wald be plessyd off that thing. ?eit mony fled and durst nocht bid Eduuard; Sum in-to Ros and in the Ilis past part. The byschop Synclar agayn fled in-to But; With that fals king he had no will to mut. Thus, wyth-out straik, the castellis off Scotland King Eduuard haill has tane in his awin hand; Deuidyt syn to men that he wald lik Strenthis and toun, to Ros throuch this kynrik. Baith hycht and waill obeyed all till his will. As he commaund thai purpos to fullfill. The byschoprykis inclynyt till his croun, Bathe temperalite and all the religioun. The Roman bukis at than was in Scotland He gart be brocht to scham quhar thai thaim fand And but radem thai brynt thaim thar Ilkan. Salysbery oys our clerkis than has tan. The lordis he tuk that wald nocht off him hald, In Ingland send full nobill blud off ald. Schyr Wil?am lang Douglace to Londe he send In strang presoun, quhar throuch he maid his end. The Erll Thomas that lord was off Murray And lord Frysaill with him he send away, Als Hew the Hay and othir ayris ma. He gert Wallang with thaim in Ingland ga. Na man was left all this mayn land within Fra Eduuardis pees, was knawin off ony kyn. Cetoun, Lawder, duelt still in-to the Bas, With thaim Lundy and men that worthi was. The Erll Malcom and Cambell past but let In But, succour with Synclar for to get. Schir Ihon Ramsay and Rowan than fled north To thar Cusyng that lord was off Fyllorth, Quhilk past with thaim throw Murray landis rycht. So fand thai thar a gentill worthi knycht At Climace hecht, full cruell ay had beyn And fayndyt weill amang his Enemys keyn. He thocht neuir at Eduuardis faith to be. In-till his tym he gert feill Sotheroun de. He led thir lordis in Ros with-outyn mar, At the Stokfurd a stark strenth byggit thar, Kepyt that land rycht worthely be wer. Till thar Enemys thai did full mekill der. Adam Wallace and Lyndsay off Cragge Away thai fled be nycht apon the Se, And Robert Boid quhilk was baith wys and wicht. Arane thai tuk to fend thaim at thar mycht. The Corspatrik in-to Dunbar baid still. Fewte full sone he had maid Eduuard till. Abyrnethe, lord Soullis and Cummyn als, And Ihon off Lorn that lang had beyn full fals, The lord Brechyn and mony othir, baid At Eduuardis faith for gyftis he thaim maid. Iusten off pees for xx?? dayis set he Off Inglismen in Lorn, at men mycht be Playn to declayr, bot for this caus Iwys, That all Scotland be conques than was his. The lordis than and byschop gud Synclar Sone out off But thai maid a ballingar To gud Wallace, tald him thar turment haill. Than wrait thai thus to get bwte off thar baill: “Our help, our heill, our hop, our gouernour, Our gudly gyd, our best chyftane in stour, Our lord, our luff, our strenth, our rychtwysnas, For goddis saik radeym ws anys to grace And tak the croun, till ws It was kyndar, To bruk for ay, or fals Eduuard it war.” The wryt he gat, bot ?eit suffer he wald For gret falsheid that part him did off ald. Mekill dolour it did him in his mynd Off thar mysfayr, for trew he was and kynd. He thocht to tak amendis off that wrang. He ansuerd nocht but in his wer furth rang. Off king Eduuard ?eit mar furth will I meill, In-to quhat wys that he couth Scotland deill. In Sanct Ihonstoun the Erll off ?ork he maid Capdane to be off all thai landis braid Fra Tay to Dee, and wndyr him Butlar. His grantschyr had at Kynclewin endit thar, His fadyr als, Wallace thaim bathe had slayn; Eduuard tharfor maid him a man off mayn. The lord Bewmound in-to the north he send. Thai lordschippys all thai gaiff him in commend. To Sterlyn syn fra Sanct Ihonstoun he went, Thair to fulfill the layff off his entent. The lord Clyffurd he gaiff than Douglace daill, Rewllar to be off the south merchis haill. All Galloway than he gaiff Cumyn in hand— Wyst nayn bot god how lang that stait suld stand! The gentill lord, gud byschop Lammyrtoun Off Sanct Androws, had Douglace off Renoun. Befor that tyme ?ong Iamys, wicht and wys, Till him was cummyn fra scullis off Parys. A prewa fawour the bischop till him bar, Bot Inglismen was so gret maisteris thar He durst nocht weill in playn schaw him kyndnes; Quhill on a day he tuk sum hardines, Douglace he cald and couth to Styrlyng fayr, Quhar king Eduuard was deland landis thair. He proferd him in-to the kingis seruice, To bruk his awin. Fra he wist in this wys Douglace he was, than he forsuk planle, Swor, “Be Sanct George, he brukis na landis off me! His fadyr was in-contrar off my crown. Tharfor as now he bidis in our presoun.” To the byschop nane othir grant he maid, Bot as he plesd delt furth thai landis braid. To the lord Soullis all haill the Mers gaiff he And Captane als off Berweik for to be. Olyfant than, that he in Sterlyng fand, Quhen he him had he wald nocht kep his band, The quhilk he maid or he him Sterlyng gaiff. Desaitfully thus couth he him dissayff, In-till Ingland send him till presoun strang. In gret distres he lewyt thar full lang. Quhen Eduuard king had delt all this Regioun His leyff he tuk, in Ingland maid him boun. Out off Stirlyng southward as thai couth ryd Cumyn hapnyt ner-hand the Bruce to bid. Thus said he, “Schir, and ?he couth keip consaill I can schaw her quhilk may be ?our awaill.” The Bruce ansuerd, “Quhat euir ?he say to me As for my part sall weill conseillyt be.” Lord Cumyn said, “Schir, knaw ?e nocht this thing, That off this Realm ?e suld be rychtwys king?” Than said the Bruce, “Suppos I rychtwys be, I se no tym to tak sic thing on me. I am haldin in-to my Enemys hand Wndyr gret ayth, quhen I com in Scotland Nocht part fra him for profyt nor request, Na for na strenth bot gyff ded me arest. He hecht agayn to gyff this land to me. Now fynd I weill It is bot sutelte, For thus thow seis he delys myn heretage, To Sotheroun part and sum to traytouris wage.” Than Cumyn said, “Will ?e her-to accord, Off my landys and ?e lik to be lord, ?e sall thaim hawe for ?our rycht off the croun; Or and ?e lik, schir, for my warisoun I sall ?ow help with power at my mycht.” The Bruce ansuerd, “I will nocht sell my rycht Bot on this wys, quhat lordschip thou will craiff For thi supple I hecht thou sall it haiff.” “Cum fra ?on king, schir, with sum ieperte. Now Eduuard has all Galloway geyffyn to me. My newo Soullis, that kepis Berweik toun, At ?our commaund his power sall be boun. My newo als, a man off mekill mycht, The lord off Lorn, has rowme in-to the hycht. My thrid newo, a lord off gret renoun, Will rys with ws, off Breichin the barroun.” Than said the Bruce, “Fell thar sa far a chance That we micht get agane Wallace of France, Be witt and force he couth this kynryk wyn. Allace, we haiff our lang beyn haldin in twyn.” To that langage Cumyn maid na record, Off ald deidis in-till his mynd remord. The Bruce and he completyt furth thar bande, Syn that sammyn nycht thai sellyt with thar hande. This Ragment left the Bruce with Cumyn thar; With king Eduuard haym In Ingland can far And thar remaynyt quhill this ragment war knawin; Thre ?er and mar or Bruce persewyt his awin. Sum men demys that Cwmyn that Ragment send. Sum men tharfor agaynys makis defend. Nayn may say weill Cumyn was saklasing Becaus his wiff was Eduuardis ner Cusing. He serwyt dede be rycht law off his king, So raklesly myskepyt sic a thing. Had Bruce past by but baid to Sanct Ihonstoun Be haill assent he had rasawyt the croun. On Cumyn syn he mycht haiff done the law. He couth nocht thoill fra tym that he him saw, Thus Scotland left in hard perplexite. Off Wallace mar in sum-part spek will we. BOOK XII The Sayr trawaill, the ernystfull besynas, The feill labour he had in mony place To wyn the land at the gud king him gaiff! In-till his ryng he wald no Sotheroun saiff. In Gyan land Wallace was still at wer. Off Scotlandis los It did his hart gret der. Off trew Scottis in mynd he had pete; He thocht to help quhen he his tym mycht se. Off set battaillis fyve he dyscumfyt haill, But ieperte and mony strang assaill. Syn thai forsuk and durst him nocht abid. The Sotheroun fled fra him on athir sid. To Burdeous in gret multiplye Than com thai stufft with wictaill be the se. All Gyan land Wallace brocht till his pees. To Burdeous ?it he past or he wald ces. On out byggyngis full gret maistre thai maid. Still saxte dayis at sar sail?e thai baid. Fortrace and werk that was with-out the toun Thai brak and brynt and put to confusioun; Hagis, alais, be laubour that was thar Ful?eit and spilt; thai wald no froitis spar. The Inglismen maid gret defens agayn With schot and cast, for thai war mekill off mayn. Off gownnys thai war and gan?eis stuffyt weill, All artail?e and wapynnys off fyn steill, With men and meit within war buskit beyn. Thar gret Capdane was wys, cruell and keyn, Off Glosyster that huge hie lord and her. This Erll had beyn weill vsyt in-to wer, Kepyt his men be wit and hardement. With-out the toun thar durst nane fra him went. The landis with-out wer ner waistyt away, Wermen so lang in-to the contre lay. In Wallace ost so scantyt the wictaill Thai mycht nocht bid no langar till assaill. Than this wis lord, the duk off Orlyance, To Wallace said, “Schir, ?e suld knaw this chance. It standis our weill with this fals Sotheroun blud, For on no wayis we can nocht stop thar fud. The hawin thai haiff and schippis at thar will. Off Ingland cummys enewch off wictaill thaim till.

Be his assent ?e may at lasar waill With prouisioun agayn for till assaill.” Wallace Inclynd and thankit this wys lord. Than thai tranontyt all in a gud concord, Past wp in France with honour to the king And schawit him haill the verite off this thing, And he tharoff in hart was wondyr glaid. Franch men befor, that C ?er, nocht haid Off Gyan halff sa mekill in-to thar hand. Wrytting be than, was new cumyn off Scotland, Fra part off lordis and byschop gud Synclar, Besocht the king into thir termys fair, Off his gentrice and off his gudlye grace, For thar supple, to consaill gude Wallace To cum agayne and bring thaim off bandoun And tak to wer the croun off that regioun. This wrytt as than he wald nocht till him schaw. Rycht laith he war for frendschip, feid or aw, Wallace suld pas sa son fra his presens. A duelling place he tuk to residens; In Schynnown still Wallace his duelling maid And held about rycht likand landis braid. A keyn Capdane than clemyt in heretage Office off it and gret landis in wage, Tharfor he thocht gud Wallace for to sla. Wndyr colour sic maistre for to ma Lang tym he socht to get a day and place, Said he desyrd in seruice to Wallace. A tryst thai set with xvi on the sid. Fyfty thar-by he gert in buschement byd Off men in armys; quhen he with Wallace met Rycht awfully he bad thaim on him set. Na armour had Wallace men in-to that place Bot suerd and knyff thai bur on thaim throw grace. Parteis beyn met ner a fayr forest sid. Rycht boustously this Capdane said that tyd At Wallace held off his landis vnrycht. Rycht sobyrly he said to that Franch knycht, “I haiff no land bot quhilk the king gaiff me. My lyff tharfor has beyne In ieperte.” The knycht ansuerd, “Thi lyff thow sall forlorn Or ellis that land, the contrar quha had suorn. On bak he lap and owt his suerd he drew. The buschement brak quhen he that takyn schew. Gud Wallace thocht that mater stud nocht weill. He gryppyt sone a scherand suerd off steill And at a straik the knycht to ded he draiff. About xvi sone lappyt all the layff. Wallace and his so worthely thai wrocht, Full feill thai slew that sarest on thaim socht. The knychtis brodyr rycht stalwart was and strang And thocht he suld be wengyt or thai gang. Off Wallace men sum-part thai woundyt sair. Mawand thar was in-till a medow fair Ix stout carllis, all serwandis to that knycht. Sythis thai hynt and ran in all thar mycht To the fechtaris. Or thai com ner that place Off thaim persawyt rycht weill was gud Wallace. Sa awfull thing off sic he neuir saw. Thaim to rasyst him selff can to thaim draw, In-to the stour left his men fechtand still To meit thai carllis that com with egyr will. The fyrst leit draw at Wallace with his sith; Deliuer he was and heich our lappyt swyth And aukwart straik that churl apon the hed. Derffly on ground he has him left for ded. The tothir he met, our-lap his Syth so keyn, On the schuldir als straik him in that teyn. Throuch all the cost the noble suerd doun schair. The thrid he met, with a rycht awfull fayr The groundyn Syth at Wallace he leit drall. This gud chyftan cleynly our-lap thaim all. With his gud suerd he maid a hidwys wound, Left thaim for ded, syne on the ferd can found; On the wan bayn with gret Ire can him ta, Cleyffyt the cost rycht cruelly in twa. Thre formast sythis thus gud Wallace our-lap And iiii he slew; thai saw sic was his hap, A nothir man he slew ay at a straik. The layff fled fast, thus can the power slaik. Wallace folowed and sone the fyrst our-tais, Straik him to ded that na forthyr he gais, Syn sped him fast till his awn men agayn. Be than thai had the knychtis brothyr slayn. Sexte and vi xvi to ded has dycht, Bot saiff vii men at fled out of thar sycht, V malwaris als that Wallace selff with met. To Franch men syn na sic trystis he set Be caus at thai him brocht to sic a cace. The king hard tell weill chapyt was Wallace, Send for him sone and prayit him for to be Off his houshald, so leyff in gud saufte, For weill he saw thai had him at Inwye. Still with him selff he gert him bid forthi. Twa ?eris thus wyth myrth Wallace abaid Still in-to Frans and mony gud Iornay maid; The king him plessed in all his gudly mayn, Fra him he thocht he suld nocht part agayn. Lordys and ladiis honoryd him reuerently. Wrechys and schrewis ay had him at Inwy. Twa campiowns, that tyme duelt with the king, Had gret despyt at Wallace in all thing. To-giddyr ay ?eid thir twa campiowns, Of felloun fors and frawart attenciouns. Rycht gret despyt thai spak oft off Scotland Quhill on a day It hapnyt apon hand, Wallace and thai was lewit all thaim allayn Be awentur in-till a hous off stayne. Thai oysyt to ber na wapynnys in that hall, Thai trowyt tharfor a mys thai mycht nocht fall. Thar commownd thai off Scotland scornfully. Than Wallace said, “?e wrang ws owtragely, Sen we ar bownd in frendschip to ?our kyng And he off ws is plessed in all thing. Als Scottis men has helpyth this realm off dreid. Me think ?e suld geyff gud word for gud deid.” “Quhat may ?e spek off ?our Enemys bot Ill?”, In lychtlynes thai maid ansuer him till, And hym dispysyt in thar langage als. “?e Scottis,” thai said, “has euir ?eit beyne fals.” Wallace tuk ane on the face in his teyn Wyth his gud hand, quhill nes, mouth and eyn, Throuch the braith blaw all byrstyt owt off blud. Butles to ground he smat him quhar he stud. The tothir hynt to Wallace in that sted, For weill he wend his falow had beyn ded, And he agayn in grieff him grippyt sayr Quhill spretis fail?eid, ner he mycht do no mayr. The fyrst frek rais and smat on Wallace fast. Bathe to the ded he brocht thaim at the last. Apon a pillar thair harnys owt he dang, Bot with his handis, syn owt at the dur thaim flang, And said, “Quhat dewyll mowyt ?on churllys at me? Lang tyme in France I wald haiff lattyn thaim be.” Traistis for trewth, thus war thai ded in-deid, Thocht Franchmen now likis it nocht to reid. Als I will ces and put It nocht in rym; Better thar-is quha rycht can luk the tym. Mony gret lord was displessyd in Frans Bot the gud king that knew all haill the chans, Oft gret dispyt off Scotland spokyn had thai. This passyt our quhill eftir a nothir day. Was nayn off thaim at durst it wndirtak He had done wrang nor tharfor battaill mak. This Ryoll Roy a hie worschip him gaiff, As conquerour him honowryd our the layff. A fell lyoun the king had gert be brocht With-in a barrace, for gret harm that he wrocht, Terlyst in yrn, na mar power him gaiff. Off wodnes he excedyt all the layff, Bot he was fayr and rycht felloun in deid. In that strang strenth the king gert men him feid, Kepyt him close fra folk and bestiall. In the court duelt twa squieris off gret waill, At cusyngis war on-to thir campiounis twa, The quhilk befor Wallace hapnyt to sla. A band thai maid in prewa illusioun, At thar power to wyrk his confusion Be ony meyn, throw frawd or sutelte. Eftir tharfor thai roucht nocht for to de, To ded or schaym sa that thai mycht him bryng. Apon a tym thai went on-to the king: “This man,” thai said, “at ?e sa welthfull mak, He seis nocht her bot he wald wndyrtak Be his gret fors to put to confusioun. Now he desyris to fecht on ?our lyoun And bad ws ask at ?ow this battaill strang, ?e grant him leyff in that barrace to gang.” Sadly agayn to thaim ansuerd the king, “Sayr me forthinkis at he desiris sic thing, Bot I will nothir for greyff nor gret plesance Deny Wallace quhat he desiris off France.” Than went thai furth and sone met with Wallace. A fygourd taill thai tald hym off this cace. “Wallace,” thai said, “the king desiris that ?e Doren battaill sa cruell be to se And chargis ?ou to fecht on his lioun.” Wallace ansuerd in haisty conclusioun And said, “I sall quhat be the kingis will At my power rycht glaidly to fulfill. Than passit he on to the king but mair. A lord off court, quhen he approchyt thar, Wnwisytly sperd with-outyn prouisioun, “Wallace, dar ?e go fecht on our lioun?” And he said, “?a, so the king suffer me, Or on ?our selff gyff ?e ocht better be.” Quhat will ?e mar? This thing amittyt was, That Wallace suld on to the lyoun pas, The king thaim chargyt to bryng him gud harnas, And he said, “Nay, god scheild me fra sic cas. I wald tak weid suld I fecht with a man, Bot for a dog that nocht off armes can I will haiff nayn bot synglar as I ga.” A gret manteill about his hand can ta, And his gud suerd, with him he tuk na mar; Abandounly in barrace entryt thar. Gret chenys was wrocht in the ?et with a gyn And puld it to quhen Wallace was tharin. The wod lyoun on Wallace quhar he stud Rampand he braid, for he desyryt blud, With his rude pollis in the mantill rocht sa. Aukwart the bak than Wallace can him ta With his gud suerd that was off burnyst steill. His body in twa It thruschyt euerilk deill. Syn to the king he raykyt in gret Ire And said on lowd, “Was this all ?our desyr, To wayr a Scot thus lychtly in-to wayn? Is thar ma doggis at ?e wald ?eit haiff slayn? Go bryng thaim furth, sen I mon doggis qwell, To do byddyng quhill that I with ?ow duell. It gaynd full weill I graithit me to Scotland; Fer grettar deidis thair men has apon hand Than with a dog in battaill to escheiff! At ?ou in France for euir I tak my leiff.” The king persawyt Wallace agrewyt was, So ernystfully he askyt leiff to pass; Rewid in his mynd at It was hapnyt sa, Sa lewd a deid to lat him wndyrta, Knawand the worschip and the gret nobilnace Off hym quhilk sprang that tym in mony place. Hwmblely he said, “?e suld disples ?ou nocht. This ?e desyryt. It mowyt neuir in my thocht, And be the faith I aw the croun off France I thocht neuyr to charge ?ou with sic chance, Bot men off waill at askyt it for ?ow.” Wallace ansuerd, “At god I mak a wow, I likyt neuir sic battaill to be In. Apon a dog no worschip is to wyn.” The king consawyt how this falsheid was wrocht. The squiers bath was till his presens brocht, Coud nocht deny quhen thai com him befor. All thar trespas thai tald with-outyn mor. The king commaundyt thai suld be don to ded, Smat off thar hedys with-out ony rameid. The campiounis, lo, for Inwy causlace, To sodand dede Wallace thaim brocht throu cace. The squiers als, fra thar falsheid was kend, Inwy thaim brocht bathe till a sodand end. Lordis, behald, Inwy the wyle dragoun, In cruell fyr he byrnys his regioun; For he is nocht that bonde is in Inwy, To sum myscheiff It bryngis hym haistely. Forsaik Inwy, thow sall the bettir speid. Heroff as now I will no forthir reid, Bot in my mater as I off for began I sall conteyn als playnly as I can. Quhen Wallace saw thai had him at Inwy, Langar to byd he coud than nocht apply. Bettir him thocht in Scotland for to be And awnter tak othir to leiff or de. Till help his awn he had a mar plesance Than thar to byd with all the welth off France. Thus his haill mynd, manheid and hye curage, Was playnly set to wyn out off bondage Scotland agayn, fra payn and felloun sor. He woude he suld, or ellis de tharfor. The king has seyn how gud Wallace was set, The lettir than him gaiff with-outyn let, The quhilk off lait fra Scotland was him send. Wallace it saw and weill thar harmys kend Be the fyrst wryt tharto accordiall. Thaim to supple he thocht he wald nocht fall. Quhar-to suld I her-off lang proces mak? Wallace off France a gudly leiff can tak. The kyng has seyn it wald nocht ellis be, To chawmyr went and mycht nocht on him se, Gret languor tuk quhen Wallace can ramuff. That king till him kepit kyndnes and luff. Iowallis and gold his worschip for to saiff He bad thaim geyff, als mekill as he wald haiff. Lordys and ladyis wepyt wondyr fast Quhen Wallace thar so tuk his leyff and past. Na men he tuk bot quhilk he hydder brocht. Agayn with him gud Longaweill furth socht. For payn nor blys that gud knycht left him neuir, For cace befell, quhill ded maid thaim deseuir. Towart the Sluce, a gudly fer, past he, A weschell gat and maid him to the se; Viii schipmen feit and gudly wage thaim gaiff, To Scotland fur, the fyrth off Tay thai haiff. Apon a nycht Wallace the land has tane At Ernys mouth and is till Elchok gane. He gert the schip in cowert saill away, So out of Sycht thai war or it was day. At Elchok duelt ane, Wallace cusyng der, At Craufurd hecht. Quhen thai the hous com ner, On the baksyd Wallace a window fand And In he cald. Sone Crawfurd com at hand. Fra tym he wyst that it was gud Wallace In-till his bern he ordand thaim a place. A mow off corn he gyhyt thaim about And closyt weill, nane mycht persawe without; Bot at a place quhar meit he to thaim brocht And bedyn to, als glaidly as he mocht. A dern holl furth on the north syd thai had To the watter, quharoff Wallace was glad. Four dayis or v in rest thai soiornd thar, Quhill meit was gayn; than Craufurd bownd for mar Till Sanct Iohnstoun, thar purwyance for to by. Inglismen thocht he tuk mar boundandly Than he was wount at ony tym befor. Thai haiff him tane, put him in presone sor. Quhat gestis he had, to tell thai mak raquest. He said it was bot till a kyrkyn fest, ?eit thai preiff sone the cumyng off Wallace. Knawlage to get thai kest a sutell cace. Thai latt him pas with thing that he had bocht, Syn eftir sone, in all the haist thai mocht, To harnes ?eid the power off the toun. Viii hundreth men with Butler maid thaim boun, Folowid on dreich quhill at this man com hame. Wallace him saw and said he serwit blame: “In my sleping a fell visioun me tauld, Till Inglismen that thow suld me haiff sauld.” Craufurd him said he had bene turment sair With Inglismen, that had him in dispair: “Tharfor, rys wp and for sum succour se. I dreid full sair thai set wachis on me.” The worthi Scottis, thai graithit thaim in gud weid, Thar wapynnys tuk, syn off that hous furth ?eid. Thus sodandly the fell Sotheroun thai saw. To few thai war to bid agayn thaim aw At keynly com with ?ong Butler the knycht. Than Wallace said, “A playn feild is nocht rycht, Bot Elchok park is ner-hand her besid. The fyrst sail?e we think thar for to byd.” Xix thai war, and Craufurd with gud will The twentyd man the nowmer to fullfill. The park thai tuk. Wallace a place has seyn Off gret holyns that grew bathe heych and greyn. With thuortour treis a maner strenth maid he. Or that war wone thai trowit to gar feill de. The wod was thyk bot litill off breid or lenth. Had thai had meit thai thocht to hald that strenth. The Inglismen passyt to Craufurdys place, Fand in the bern the lugeyng off Wallace. Than Crawfurdis wyff in handys haiff thai tane And ast at hyr quhat way the Scottis war gane. Rycht weill thai trowyt at Wallace suld thar be, Off France in Tay he was cumyn be the se. Scho wald nocht tell for bost nor ?eit reward. Than Butler said, “Our lang thow has beyn spard.” Thar-with he grew in matelent in Ire And gert thaim byg a bailfull, braid, brym fyr. The Sotheroun suor tharin scho suld brynt be. Than Wallace said, “Scho sall nocht end for me. Gret syn it war ?on saikles wicht to sla. Or scho suld end in faith thar sall de ma.” He left the strenth and the playn feild can ta. On lowd he criyt and said, “Lo, her I ga. Thinkis thow no schaym for to turment a wyff? Cum fyrst to me and mak end off our stryff.” Fra Butler had apon gud Wallace seyn Throuch auld malice he wox ner wod for teyn; Apon the Scottis schup thaim all with gret mayn, Bot Wallace son the strenth he tuk agayn. A fell bykkyr the Inglismen began, Assail?eid sayr with mony cruell man, Bot thai with-in war nobill at defens, Maid gret debait be force and wiolens. At that entra xv thai brocht to ded. Than all the lawe ramowit fra that sted, ?eid till aray, agayn to sail?e new. Wallace beheld, quhilk weill in weir him knew. “Falowis,” he said, “agayn all at this place Thai will nocht saill, but thus standis the cace. ?on knycht thinkis for to dewid his men In seir partis, the suth ?e sall weill ken, Agayn on ws to preiff how it may be. Ws worthis now sum wayis for thaim to se, Contrar thar mycht a gud defens to mak. Now Longaweill, thow sall sex with the tak. Wil?am my eym, als mony sall with ?ow ga, And v with me, as now we haiff no ma.” Knycht Butler than partyt his men in thre. Wallace wesyd quhar Butler schup to be. Thidder he past that entre for to wer. On Ilka syd thai sail?e with gret fer. Wallace leit part in the entre begyn, Bot nane ?eid out that on the Scottis com In. Vii formast was quhilk to the forest ?eid. Wallace v men, quhilk douchty was in deid, Ilkane slew ane and Wallace gert twa de. Butler was wext and said, “This will nocht be!” On bak he drew and leit his curage slaik. The worthi Scottis prewyt weill for Scotlandis saik. Gud Longaweill his cownter maid sa sar, And Craufurd als, thai sail?eid than no mar. Rycht ner be than approchyt to the nycht And Sternys wp peyr began in-to thair sycht. Sotheroun set wach and to thar souper went. The Butler was sayr grewyt in his entent; ?eit fur thai weill off stuff, wyn, aill and breid. Wallace and his thai wyst off no rameid Bot cauld watter than ran throu-owt a strand. In that lugeyng nane othir fud thai fand. Than Wallace said, “Gud falowis, think nocht lang. Will god, we sall be sone out off this thrang. Suppos we fast a day our and a nycht, Tak al in thank this payn for Scotlandis rycht.” The Erll off ?ork, was in Sanct Ihonstoun still, To Butler send and bad him byd at will; Till him full sone thar suld cum new power And als him selff, thus tald the messynger. Butler wald fayn Wallace had ?oldyn beyn Or the Erll com, for thir causis was seyn, His grantschir bathe and his fadyr he slew. This knycht thar-with towart the park him drew. Quhat cher thai maid, apon the Scottis cald. Than Wallace said, “Fer better than thow wald.” The Butler said, “I wald fayn spek with the.” Wallace ansuerd, “Thow may for litill fe.” “Wallace,” he said, “thow has done me gret scaith. My rycht fadyr and grantschir thow slew baith.” Than Wallace said, “For stait at thow art In It war my det for till wndo thi kyn; And I think als, sa god off hewin me saiff, At my twa handis sall graith the to thi graiff.” The Butler said, “That is nocht likly now. In my credence and thow will fermly trow, Off this I ask and thow will mak me grant, Quhat I the hecht that thing thow sall nocht want.” “Sa furth,” quod he. “Be thi desyr resonable I sall It grant, with-outyn ony fable.” The Butler said, “Wallace, thow knawis rycht, Thow may nocht chaip for power nor for slycht, And sen thow seis it may no bettir be For thi gentrice thow will ?eild the to me.” Than Wallace said, “Thi will wnskillfull is. Thow wald I did quhilk is our hye a mys. ?oldin I am to better, I can pruff, To mychty god that makar is abuff; For euerilk day sen I had wit off man Befor my werk to ?eild me I began, And als at ewyn, quhen that I fail?eid lycht, I me be-tuk to the makar off mycht.” The Butler said, “Me think thow has done weill, ?eit off a thing I pray the lat me feill. For thi manheid this forthwart to me fest, Quhen that thow seis thow may no langer lest, On this Ilk place quhilk I haiff tane to wer At thow cum furth and all othir forber.” Than Wallace leuch at his cruell desyr And said, “I sall, thocht thow war wod as fyr And all Ingland contrar tharoff had suorn. I sall cum out at that Ilk place to-morn, Or ellys to-nycht, traist weill quhat I the say. I byd nocht her quhill ix houris off the day.” Butler send furth the chak wache on Ilka syd. In that Ilk place bauldly he bownyt to bid. Thus still thai baid quhill day began to peyr. A thyk myst fell, the planet was nocht cleyr. Wallace assayed at all placis about, Leit as he wald at ony place brek out, Quhill Butleris men sum-part fra him can ga To helpe the lawe. Quhen thai saw it was sa Wallace and his fast sped thaim to that sted. Quhar Butler baid feill men thai draiff to ded. The worthy Scottis sone past throuch that melle. Craufurd, thar oyst, was sayr hurt on the kne. At Erd he was. Gud Wallace turned agayn And at a straik he has the Butler slayn, Hynt wp that man wndyr his arm sa strang, Defendand him out off that felloun thrang. Gud rowm he maid amang thaim quhar he gais. With his rycht hand he slew v off thair fais, Bur furth Crawfurd be force of his persoune Ix akyrbreid or euir he set him doun. The Sotheroun fand at thar capdane was ded, All him about, bot than was no rameid; Xxx?? with him off the wychtast thai brocht Ded at that place quhar at the Scottis furth socht. Wallace and his be than was off thar sycht. Sotheroun baid still for sor los off that knycht. The myst wes myrk; that Wallace likit weill. Him selff was gyd and said to Longaweill, “At Meffan wood is my desyr to be, On bestaill thar for meit that we may se.” Be than thai war weill cumyn to the hicht, The myst scalyt, the son schawyt fayr and brycht. Son war thai war, a litill space thaim by, Four and twenty was In a cumpany. Than Wallace said, “Be ?on men freynd or fa, We will to thaim, sen at thai ar na ma.” Quhen thai com ner a nobill knycht it was, The quhilk to name hecht Elys off Dundas; And Schyr Ihon Scot, was ek a worthi knycht, In-to Straithern a man of mekill mycht, For thar he had gret part of heretage. Dundas systyr he had in mariage. Passand thai war, and mycht no langar lest, Till Inglismen thar fewte for to fest. Lord off Breichyn sic connand had thaim maid, Off Eduuard thai suld hald thar landys braid; Bot fra thai saw that It was wicht Wallace, Heyffyt wp thar handis and thankit god off grace Off his gret help quhilk he had sende thaim thair. To Meffen wod with ane assent thai far, Sone gat thaim meit off bestiall at thai fand, Restyt that day; quhen nycht was cumyn on hand To Byrnane wod but restyng ar thai gayne, Quhar thai haiff found the squier, gud Ruwayn. In vtlaw oys he had lang lewyt thair On bestiall, quhill he mycht get no mair. Thai taryit nocht bot in-till Adell ?eid, Quhar mete was scant. Than Wallace had gret dreid, Past in-till Lorn and rycht litill fand thair. Off wyld and taym that contre was maid bayr. Bot in strenthis thar fud was lewyt nayn. The worthi Scottis than maid a petous mayn. Schir Ihon Scot said he had fer leuir de In-till gud naym and leyff his ayris fre, Than for till byd as bond in subieccioun. Quhen Wallace saw thir gud men off renoun With hungyr stad, almast mycht leiff no mar, Wyt ?e for thaim he sichit wondyr sar. “Gud men,” he said, “I am the caus off this. At ?our desyr I sall amend this mys, Or leyff ?ou fre sum chewysans for to ma.” All him allayn he bownyt fra thaim to ga, Prayit thaim to byd quhill he mycht cum agayn. Atour a hill he passit till a playn. Out off thar sycht in-till a forest syd He sat him doun wndyr ane ayk to bid. His bow and suerd he lenyt till a tre. In angwys greiff on grouff so turned he. His petows mynd was for his men so wrocht That off him selff litill as than he rocht. “O wrech,” he said, “that neuir couth be content Off our gret mycht that the gret god the lent, Bot thi fers mynd wylfull and wariable, With gret lordschip thow coud nocht so byd stable, And wyllfull witt for to mak Scotland fre. God likis nocht that I haiff tane on me. Fer worthyar off byrth than I was born Throuch my desyr wyth hungyr ar forlorn. I ask at god thaim to restor agayn. I am the caus. I suld haiff all the payn.” Quhill studeand thus, quhill flitand with him sell, Quhill at the last apon a slepyng he fell. Thre dayis befor thar had him folowed v, The quhilk was bound, or ellis to los thar lyff. The Erll of ?ork bad thaim so gret gardoun At thai be thyft hecht to put Wallace doun. Iii off thaim was all born men off Ingland And twa was Scottis, that tuk this deid on hand, And sum men said thar thrid brothir betraissed Kyldrome eft, quhar gret sorow was raissed. A child thai had quhilk helpyt to ber mett In wildernes amang thai montans grett. Thai had all seyn disseueryng off Wallace Fra his gud men and quhar he baid on cace; Amang thyk wod in cowert held thaim law Quhill thai persawyt he was on sleping faw, And than thir v approchit Wallace neir. Quhat best to do at othir can thai speir. A man said thus, “It was a hie renoun And we mycht qwyk leid him to Sanct Ihonstoun. Lo, how he lyis. We may our grippis waill. Off his wapynnys he sall get nane awaill. We sall him bynd in-contrar off his will And leid him thus on baksyd off ?on hill, So that his men sall no-thing off him knaw.” The tothir four assentyt till his saw, And than thir v thus maid thaim to Wallace And thocht throw force to bynd him in that place. Quhat! Trowit thir v for to hald Wallace doun? The manlyast man, the starkast off persoun Leyffand he was, and als stud in sic rycht We traist weill god his dedis had in sycht. Thai grippyt him. Than out off slepe he braid. “Quhat menys this?”, rycht sodandly he said. About he turnd and wp his armys thrang. On thai traytours with knychtlik fer he dang. The starkast man in-till his armys hynt he And all his harnys he dang out on a tre. A sword he gat son eftyr at he rays. Campiounlik amang the iiii he gais. Euir a man he gert de at a dynt. Quhen twa was ded the tothir wald nocht stynt, Maid thaim to fle, bot than it was na but. Was nane leyffand mycht pas fra him on fut. He folowed fast and sone to ded thaim brocht. Than to the chyld sadly agayn he socht. “Quhat did thow her?” The child, with a paill face, On kneis he fell and askyt Wallace grace. “With thaim I was and knew no-thing thar thocht. In-to seruice as thai me bad I wrocht.” “Quhat berys thow her?” “Bot meit,” the child can say. “Do turs it wp and pas with me away. Meit in this tym is fer better than gold.” Wallace and he furth foundyt our the fold. Quha brocht Wallace fra his Enemys bauld? Quha bot gret god that has the warld in wauld. He was his help in mony felloun thrang. With glaid cheyr thus on till his men can gang. Bathe rostyt flesche thar was, als breid and cheis, To succour thaim that was in poynt to leis. Than he It delt to four men and fyfte Quhilk had befor fastyt our dayis thre, Syn tuk his part. He had fastyt als lang. Quhar herd ?e euir ony in sic a thrang, In hungyr so, slepand and wapynlas, So weill recouer as Wallace did this cas, Playnly befors vencust his Enemys v? ?he men off wit, this questioun dyscryve. Wythoutyn glois I will tell furth my taill. “How com this meit?”, the falowschip askyt haill. To thar desyr Wallace nane ansuer ?ald. Quhar v was ded he led thaim furth, syn tauld. Gretly displessyd was all that chewalry. Till a chyftane thai held it fantasy To walk allayn. Wallace with sobyr mud Said, “As her-off is no-thing cummyn bot gud.” To the law land full fast agayn thai socht, Sperd at this child gyff he couth wys thaim ocht Quhar thai mycht best off purviance for to wyn. Off nane, he said, was that cuntre within: “Nor all about, als fer as I can knaw, Quhill that ?e cum down to the Ranoucht hawe. That lord has stuft breid, aill and gud warnage. Off king Eduuard he takis full mekill wage.” Than Wallace said, “My selff sall be ?our gyd. I knaw that sted about on athir syd.” Throuch the wyld land he gydyt thaim full rycht. To Ranouch hall thai com apon the nycht. A wach was owt and that full sone thai ta; For he was Scottis that man thai wald nocht sla Bot gert him tell the maner off that place. Thus entryt thai with-in a litill space. The ?ett thai wan, for castell was thar nayn Bot mudwall werk withoutyn lym or stayn. Wallace in haist straik wp the chawmir dur Bot with his fut, that stalwart was and stur. Than thai within sa walknyt sodeynly. The lord gat wp and mercy can him cry. Fra tym he wyst that gud Wallace was thar He thankyt god, syn said thir wordis mar: “Trew man I was and woun agayn my will With Inglismen, suppos I likit Ill. All Scottis we ar that in this place is now. At ?our commaund all baynly we sall bow.” Off our nacioun gud Wallace had pete, Tuk aythis off thaim and syne meit askyt he. Gud cheyr thai maid quhill lycht day on the morn. This trew man than sone semblit him beforn Thre sonnys he had, that stalwart was and bauld, And xx?? men off his kyn in houshauld. Wallace was blyth thai maid him sic supple, Said, “‘I thank god that we thus multiple.” All that day our in gud liking thai rest. Wachys thai waill to kep thaim at coud best. Apon the morn, the lycht day quhen thai saw, Than Wallace said, “Our power for to knaw, We will tak feild and wp our baner rais Off rycht Scotland, in contrar off our fais. We will no mar now ws in couert hid. Power till ws will sembill on Ilk syd.” Horsis thai gat, the best men at was thar; Towart Dunkell the gaynest way thai far. The byschope fled and gat till Sanct Ihonstoun. The Scottis slew all was thar off that nacioun, Baith pur and rych and serwandys at thai fand, Left nane on lyff that born was off Ingland. The place thai tuk and maid thaim weill to fayr Off purwiance that byschop had brocht thair. Iowellis thai gat, bathe gold and syluer brycht. With gud cheyr thar v dayis thai soiornd rycht. On the sext day Wallace to consaill went, Gert call the best and schew thaim his entent: “Na men we haiff to sail?e Sanct Ihonstoun. In-to the north tharfor lat mak ws boun. In Ros, ?e knaw, gud men a strenth has maid. Her thai off ws thai cum with-outyn baid. Als in-to But the byschope, gud Synclar, Fra he get wit he cummys withoutin mar. Gud westland men off Aran and Rauchle, Fra thai be warnd thai will all cum to me.” This purpos tuk and in the north thai rid. Nan Inglisman durst in thar way abid. Quham Wallace tuk thai knew the ald ransoun. Fra he com haym, to fle thai mak thaim boun And Scottis men semblyt to Wallace fast. In awfull feyr throuch-owt the land thai past. Strenthis was left, witt ?e, all desolate. Agayn thir folk thai durst mak no debate. In raid battaill thai raid till Abyrdeyn; The haill nowmyr vii thousand than was seyn; Bot Inglismen, had left that toun all waist, On Ilka syd away thai can thaim haist, In all that land left nothir mar nor les. Lord Bewmound tuk the sey at Bowchan nes. Throu Scotland than was manifest in playn; The lordis that past in hart was wondyr fayn. The knycht Climes off Ros com sodeynly In Murray land with thar gud chewalry. The hous off Narn that gud knycht weill has tane, Slew the capdane and strang men mony ane. Out of Murray in Bowchane land com thai To sek Bewmound be he was past away. Than thir gud men to Wallace passyt rycht. Quhen Wallace saw schir Ihon Ramsay the knycht And othir gud at had bene fra him lang, Gret curag than was rasyt thaim amang. The land he reullyt as at him likit best, To Sanct Iohnstoun syn raid or thai wald rest. At euirilk part a stalwart wach he maid, Fermyt a sege and stedfastly abaid. Byschop Synclar in-till all haist him dycht, Com out off Bute with symly men to sycht; Owt off the Ilys off Rauchle and Aran Lyndsay and Boid with gud men mony ane. Adam Wallace barroun off Ricardtoun Full sadly socht till Wallace off renoun, At Sanct Ihonstoun baid at the sail?e still. For Sotheroun men thai mycht weill pas at will, For in thar way thar durst na Enemys be Bot fled away be land and als be se. About that toun thus semblyt thai but mor, For thai had beyn with gud Wallace befor. Cetoun, Lauder and Richard off Lunde, In a gud barge thai past about be se. Sanct Ihonstoun hawyn thar ankyr haiff thai set. Twa Inglys schippys thai tuk with-outyn let. The tane thai brynt, syn stuffyt the tothir weill With artail?e and stalwart men in steyll, To kep the port; thar suld com na wictaill In-to that toun, nor men at mycht thaim waill. Fra south and north mony off Scotland fled, Left castellys waist. Feill lost thar lyff to wed. The South byschop, befor at left Dunkell, Tyll London past and tald Eduuard him sell In Scotland thai had fallyn a gret myschance. Than send he son for Amar the Wallance And askyt him than quhat war best to do. He hecht to pas and tak gret gold tharto, In-to Scotland sic menys for to mak Agane Wallace, on hand this can he tak. He said he wald wndo king Eduuardis croun Bot gyff thai mycht throu tresoun put him doun. King Eduuard hecht, quhat thing at Wallang band He suld It kep, war It bathe gold and land. Wallange tuk leyff and is in Scotland went; To Bothwell com, syn kest in his entent Quhat man thar was mycht best Wallace begyll; And sone he fand with-in a litill quhill Schyr Ihon Menteth Wallace his gossop was. A messynger schir Amar has gert pas On to schir Ihon and sone a tryst has set. At Ruglyn kyrk thir twa to-gydder met. Than Wallang said, “Schir Ihon, thow knawis this thing, Wallace agayn rysis contrar the king, And thow may haiff quhat lordschip thow will waill And thou wald wyrk as I can gyff consaill. ?on tyrand haldys the rewmys at trowbill bathe. Till thryfty men it dois full mekill scaith. He traistis the. Rycht weyll thow may him tak. Off this mater ane end I think to mak. War he away, we mycht at liking ryng As lordys all and leiff wndyr a king.” Than Menteth said, “He is our gouernour. For ws he baid in mony felloun stour, Nocht for him selff bot for our heretage. To sell him thus, It war a foull owtrage.” Than Wallang said, “And thow weill wndyrstud, Gret neid it war; he spillis so mekill blud, Off Crystin men puttis saullis in peraill. I bynd me als he sall be haldyn haill As for his lyff and kepyt in presoune. King Eduuard wald haiff him in subieccioun.” Than Menteth thocht, sa thai wald kepe connand, He wald full fayn haiff had him off Scotland. Wallange saw him in-till a study be, Thre thowsand pundys off fyn gold leit him se And hecht he suld the Lewynhous haiff at will. Thus tresonably Menteth grantyt thar-till. Obligacioun with his awn hand he maid, Syn tuk the gold and Eduuardis seill so braid And gaiff thaim his; quhen he his tym mycht se, To tak Wallace, our Sulway giff him fre Till Inglismen. Be this tresonabill concord Schyr Ihon suld be off all the Lennox lord. Thus Wallace suld in Ingland kepyt be, So Eduuard mycht mak Scotland till him fre. Thar cowatys was our gret maister seyn. Nane sampill takis how ane othir has beyn For cowatice put in gret paynys fell, For cowatice the serpent is off hell. Throuch cowatice gud Ector tuk the ded. For cowatice thar can be no ramed. Throuch cowatice gud Alexander was lost, And Iulius als for all his reiff and bost. Throuch cowatice deit Arthour off Bretane. For cowatice thar has deit mony ane. For cowatyce the traytour Gan?elon The flour off France he put till confusion. For cowatice thai poysound gud Godfra In Antioche, as the autor will sa. For cowatice Menteth apon fals wys Betraysyt Wallace at was his gossop twys. Wallang in haist, with blyth will and glaid hart, Till London past and schawit till king Eduuart. Off this contrak he had a mar plesance Than of fyn gold had geyffyn in ballance A grettar wecht na his ransoun mycht be. Off Wallace furth ?eit sum thing spek will we, At Sanct Ihonstoun was at the segeyng still. In a mornyng Sotheroun with egyr will, V hundreth men in harnas rycht Iuntly, Thai wschet furth to mak a Ieperty At the south port apon Scot and Dundas; Quhilk in that tym rycht wys and worthy was, Agayn thar fayis rycht scharply socht and sayr. In that cownter vii scor to ded thai bayr, ?eit Inglismen at cruell war and keyn Full ferely faucht, quhar douchty deid was seyn. Fra the west ?ett drew all the Scottis haill To the fechtaris. Quhen Sotheroun saw na waill Bot in agayn, full fast thai can thaim sped. The knycht Dundas prewyt so douchty deid, Our neyr the ?ett full bandounly he baid. Wyth a gud suerd full gret maistre he maid, Nocht wittandly his falowis was him fra. In at the ?ett the Sotheroun can him ta. On to the Erll thai led him haistele. Quhen he him saw he said he suld nocht de, “To slay this ane it may ws litill rameid.” He send him furth to Wallace in that steid. On the north syd his bestials had he wrocht. Quhill he him saw off this he wyst rycht nocht; Send to the Erll and thankit him largele, Hecht for to quyt quhen he sic cace mycht se. Bot all her-for souerance he wald nocht grant, Thocht thai ?oldin wald cum as recreant. For gold na gud he wald no trewbut tak. A full strang salt than he begouth to mak. The Erll of Fyf duelt wndyr trewage lang Off king Eduuard, and than him thocht it wrang At Wallace sa was segeand Sanct Ihonstoun, Bot gyff he com in rycht help off the croun. Till Inglismen he wald nocht kep that band. Than he come sone with gud men off the land, And Ihon Wallang, was than schirreff off Fyff, Till Wallace past, starkyt him in that stryff. That Erll was cummyn off trew, haill nobill blud, Fra the ald thane quhilk in his tym was gud. Than all about to Sanct Ihonstoun thai gang With felloun salt, was hydwys, scharp and strang. Full feill fagaldys in-to the dyk thai cast, Hadyr and hay bond apon flakys fast. Wyth treis and erd a gret passage thai maid. Atour the wallis thai ?eid with battaill braid. The Sotheroun men maid gret defens agayn, Quhill on the wallys thar was a thousand slayn. Wallace ?eid in and his rayit battaill rycht. All Sotheroun men derffly to ded thai dycht. To sayff the Erll Wallace the harrald send, Gud Iop him selff, the quhilk befor him kend. For Dundas saik thai said he suld nocht de. Wallace him selff this ordand for to be. A small haknay he gert till him betak, Siluir and gold his costis for to mak; Set on his clok a takyn for to se, The lyoun in wax that suld his condet be; Conwoyit him furth and na man him withall. Wemen and barnys, Wallace gert freith thaim all And syn gert cry trew Scottis men to thar awn, Plenyst the land quhilk lang had beyn ourthrawn. Than Wallace past the south land for to se. Eduuard the Bruce, in his tym rycht worthe, That ?er befor he had in Irland ben And purchest thar off cruell men and keyn; Fyfty in feyr, was off his moderys kyn, At Kyrkwbre on Galloway entryt In. With thai fyfte he had vencust ix scor, And syn he past withoutyn tary mor Till Wygtoun sone and that castell has tane. Sotheroun was fled and left it all allane. Wallace him met with trew men reuerently. To Lowmabane went all that chewalry. Thai maid Eduuard bath lord and ledar thar. This condicioun Wallace him hecht but mar, Bot a schort tym to bid Robert the king; Gyff he come nocht in this regioun to ryng, At Eduuard suld resaiff the croun but faill. Thus hecht Wallace and all the barnage haill. In Louchmabane prynce Eduuard lewyt still And Wallace past in Cumno with blith will. At the Blak Rok, quhar he was wont to be, Apon that sted a ryall hous held he. Inglis wardans till London past but mar And tauld the king off all thar gret mysfar, How Wallace had Scotland fra thaim reduce And how he had rasawyt Eduuard the Bruce. The commouns suor thai suld cum neuir mar Apon Scotland and Wallace leiffand war. Than Eduuard wrayt till Menteth prewali, Prayit him till haist; the tym was passit by Off the promes the quhilk at he was bund. Schyr Ihon Menteth in-till his wit has fund How he suld best his purpos to fullfill. His systir son in haist he cald him till And ordand him in duellyng with Wallace. Ane ayth agayn he gert him mak on cace, Quhat tym he wyst Wallace in quiet draw He suld him warnd, for awentur mycht befaw. This man grantyt at sic thing suld be done. With Wallace thus he was in seruice sone. As off tresoun Wallace had litill thocht, His lauborous mynd on othir materis wrocht. Thus Wallace thrys has maid all Scotland fre. Than he desyryt in lestand pees to be. For as off wer he was in sumpart yrk, He purpost than to serue god and the kyrk And for to leyff wndyr hys rychtwys king. That he desyryt atour all erdly thing. The harrold Iop in Ingland sone he send And wrayt to Bruce rycht hartlie this commend, Besekand him to cum and tak his croun; Nane suld gaynstand, clerk, burges no barroun. The harrald past. Quhen Bruce saw his credans, Tharoff he tuk a perfyt gret plesans, With hys awn hand agayn wrayt to Wallace And thankyt him off lauta and kyndnas, Besekand him this mater to conseill, For he behuffyd owt off Ingland to steill; For lang befor was kepyt the ragment Quhilk Cwmyn had, to byd the gret parlement In-to London; and gyff thai him accus, To cum fra thaim he suld mak sum excus. He prayit Wallace, in Glaskow mur to walk The fyrst nycht off Iuli, for his salk, And bad he suld bot in-to quiet be, For he with him mycht bryng few chewalre. Wallace was blyth quhen he this writyng saw. His houshauld sone he gert to Glaskow draw. That moneth thar he ordand thaim to byd. Kerle he tuk Ilk nycht with him to ryd And this ?ong man that Menteth till him send— Wyst nane bot thir quhat way at Wallace wend— The quhilk gart warn his Eym the auchtand nycht. Sexte full sone Schyr Ihone Menteth gert dycht Off hys awn kyn and off alya born. To this tresoun he gert thaim all be suorn. Fra Dunbertane thai sped thaim haistely. Ner Glaskow kyrk thai bownyt thaim prewaly. Wallace past furth quhar at the tryst was set. A spy thai maid and folowed him but let Till Robrastoun, was ner be the way syd And bot a hows, quhar Wallace oysyt to byd. He wouk on fut quhill passyt was myd-nycht. Kerle and he than for a sleip thaim dycht. Thai bad this cuk that he suld wache his part And walkyn Wallace, com men fra ony art. Quhen thai slepyt this traytour tuk graith heid. He met his Eym and bad him haiff no dreid: “On sleip he is and with him bot a man. ?e may him haiff for ony craft he can, With-out the hous thar wapynnys laid thaim fra.” For weill thai wyst, gat Wallace ane off tha And on his feyt, hys ransoun suld be sauld. Thus semblyt thai about that febill hauld. This traytour wach fra Wallace than he stall Bathe knyff and suerd, his bow and arowis all. Eftir mydnycht in handis thai haiff him tane, Dyschowyll, on sleipe, wyth him na man bot ane. Kerle thai tuk and led him off that place, Dyd him to ded with-outyn langar space. Thai thocht to bynd Wallace throu strenthis strang. On fute he gat the feill traytouris amang, Grippyt about, bot na wapyn he fand. Apon a syll he saw besyd him stand The bak off ane he byrstyt in that thrang And off ane othir the harnes out he dang. Than als mony as mycht on him handis lay Be force hym hynt for till haiff him away, Bot that power mycht nocht a fute him leid Owt off that hous quhill thai or he war deid. Schir Ihon saw weill be force it coud nocht be, Or he war tayne he thocht erar to de. Menteth bad ces and thus spak to Wallace, Syn schawyt him furth a rycht sutell, fals cace: “?he haiff so lang her oysyt ?ow allane Quhill witt tharoff is in-till Ingland gane. Tharfor, her me and sobyr your curage. The Inglismen with a full gret barnage Ar semblyt her and set this hous about, That ?e be force on na wayis may wyn out. Suppos ?e had the strenth off gud Ectour, Amang this ost ?e may nocht lang Endour. And thai ?ou tak, in haist ?our ded is dycht. I haiff spokyn with lord Clyffurd that knycht, Wyth thar chyftanys weill menyt for ?our lyff. Thai ask no mar bot be quyt off ?our stryff. To Dunbertane ?e sall furth pas with me. At ?our awn hous ?e may in saifte be.” Sotheroun sic oys with Menteth lang had thai That Wallace trowyt sum-part at he wald say. Menteth said, “Schir, lo, wappynnys nane we haiff. We com in trayst, ?our lyff gyff we mycht saiff.” Wallace trowyt weill and he his gossep twys, That he wald nocht be no maner off wys Him to betrays, for all Scotland so wyd. Ane ayth off him he askit in that tid. Thar wantit wit. Quhat suld his aythis mor? Forsuorn till him he was lang tym befor. The ayth he maid. Wallace com in his will. Rycht frawdfully all thus schawyt him till: “Gossep,” he said, “as presoner thai mon ?ow se, Or thai throu force wyll ellis tak ?ow fra me.” A courch with slycht apon his handys thai laid And wndyr syn with seuir cordys thai braid, Bath scharp and tewch, and fast to-gyddyr drew. Allace, the Bruce mycht sayr that byndyng rew, Quhilk maid Scotland sone brokyn apon cace, For Comyns ded and los off gud Wallace! Thai led him furth in feyr amang thaim aw. Kerle he myst. Off na Sotheroun he saw. Than wyst he weyll that he betraysyt was. Towart the south with him quhen thai can pas, ?eit thai him said in trewth he suld nocht de, King Eduuard wald kep him in gud saufte For hie honour in wer at he had wrocht. The sayr bandys so strowblyt all his thocht, Credence tharto forsuth he coud nocht geyff. He wyst full weyll thai wald nocht lat him leiff. A fals foull caus thai Menteth for him tauld, Quhen on this wys gud Wallace he had sauld. Sum off thaim said it was to saiff thar lord. Thai leid all owt that maid that fals record. At the Fawkyrk the gud Stewart was slayn, Our corniclis rehersis that in playn, On Madelan day, that auchtand ?er befor. Comyns ded tharoff It wytnesis mor. At Robrastoun Wallas was tresonabilly, Thus falsly, stollyn fra his gud chewalry, In Glaskow lay and wyst nocht off this thing. Thus he was lost in byding off his king. South thai him led, ay haldand the west land, Delyuerit him in haist our Sullway sand. The lord Clyffurd and Wallang tuk him thar. To Carleyll toun full fast with him thai fayr, In presoun him stad. That was a gret dolour! That hous efter was callyt Wallace tour. Sum men syn said, that knew nocht weill the cas, In Berweik thai to ded put gud Wallace. Contrar is knawin fyrst be this opinioun, For Scottis men than had haly Berweik toun To Scotland fre, quhill that Soullis it gaiff, For lord Cumyn, till Ingland with the layff. Ane othir poynt is, the traytouris durst nocht pas, At sauld him sa, quhar Scottis men maisteris was. The thrid poynt is, the commouns off Ingland, Quhat thai desyr, thai will nocht wndirstand That thing be done, for wytnes at may be, Na credence geyff forthyr than thai may se. To se him de Eduuard had mar desyr Than to be lord off all the gret empyr. For thir causis thai kepyt him sa lang, Quhill the commouns mycht on to London gang. Allace, Scotland, to quhom sall thow compleyn? Allace, fra payn quha sall the now restreyn? Allace, thi help is fastlie brocht to ground. Thi best chyftane in braith bandis is bound. Allace, thow has now lost thi gyd off lycht. Allace, quha sall defend the in thi rycht? Allace, thi payn approchis wondyr ner. With sorow sone thow mon bene set in feyr.

Quha sall the now mak fre? Allace, in wer quha sall thi helpar be? Quha sall the kepe? Quha sall the now radem? Allace, quha sall the Saxons fra the flem? I can no mar bot besek god off grace The to restor in haist to rychtwysnace, Sen gud Wallace may succour the no mar. The los off him encressit mekill cair. Now off his men, in Glaskow still at lay, Quhat sorow rais quhen thai him myst away! The cruell payn, the wofull complenyng, Tharoff to tell it war our hewy thing. I will lat be and spek off it no mar. Litill rehers is our mekill off cair And principaly quhar redempcioun is nayn. It helpys nocht to tell thar petous mayn. The deid, tharoff is ?eit in remembrance! I will lat slaik off sorow the ballance. Bot Longawell to Louchmabane coud pas And thar he hecht, quhar gud prince Eduuard was, Out off Scotland he suld pas neuirmor. Los off Wallace socht till his hart so sor. The rewlm off France he wowit he suld neuer se Bot weng Wallace or ellis tharfor to de. Thar he remaynd quhill cummyn off the king. With Bruce in wer this gud knycht furth can ryng. Remembrance syn was in the Brucys buk, Secound he was quhen thai Saynct Ihonstoun tuk, Folowed the king at wynnyng off the toun. The Bruce tharfor gaiff him full gret gardoun; All Charterys land the gud king till him gaiff. Charterys sen syn off his kyn is the laiff. Quhar-to suld I fer in that story wend? Bot off my buk to mak a fynaill end. Robert the Bruce com hame on the ferd day, In Scotland, eft Wallace was had away, Till Louchmabane, quhar that he fand Eduuard, Quharoff he was gretlie reiossyt in hart; Bot fra he wyst Wallace away was led, So mekill baill with-in his breyst thar bred Ner out off wytt he worthit for to weyd. Eduuard full sone than till hys brothir ?eid. A sodane chance this was in wo fra weill. Gud Eduuard said, “This helpys nocht adell. Lat murnyng be. It may mak na remeid. ?e haiff him tynt. ?e suld raweng his deid. Bot for ?our caus he tuk the wer on hand, In ?our defens, and thrys has fred Scotland, The quhilk was tynt fra ws and all our kyn. War nocht Wallace we had neuir entryt In. Merour he was off lauta and manheid, In wer the best that euir sall power leid. Had he likyt for till haiff tane ?our croun Wald nane him let that was in this regioun. Had nocht beyne he, ?e suld had na entres In-to this rewlm, for tresoun and falsnes. That sall ?e se. The traytour that him sauld, Fra ?ow he thinkys Dunbertane for till hauld. Sum comfort tak and lat slaik off this sorou.” The king chargyt Eduuard apon the morou Radres to tak off wrang that wrocht him was. Till Dallswyntoun he ordand him to pas, And men off armys; gyff thai fand Cumyn thar, Put him to ded. For na dreid thai suld spar. Thai fand him nocht. The king him selff him slew In-till Drumfres, quhar witnes was Inew. That hapnys wrang, our gret haist in a king. Till wyrk by law it may scaith mekill thing. Me nedis heroff na forthyr for till schaw How that was done, it is knawin to ?ow aw. Bot ?ong Douglace fyrst to the king can pas, In all hys wer bath wicht and worthi was. Nor how the king has tane on him the croun, Off all that her I mak bot schort mencioun; Nor how lord Soullis gaiff Berweik toun away, How eftir syn sone tynt was Galloway, How Ihon off Lorn agayn his rycht king rais, On athir sid how Bruce had mony fais, How bauld Breichin contrar his king coud ryd. Rycht few was than in wer with him to byd. Nor how the north was gyffyn fra the gud king, Quhilk maid him lang in paynfull wer to ryng. Ay trew till him was Iamys the gud Douglace, For Brucis rycht baid weill in mony place. Wyndyr the king he was the best chyftayn, Bot Wallace rais as chyftane him allayn; Tharfor till him is no comparisoun As off a man, sauff reuerence off the croun. Bot sa mony as off Douglace has beyn Gud off a kyn was neuir in Scotland seyn. Comparisoun, that can I nocht weill declar. Off Brucis buk as now I spek no mar. Master Barbour, quhilk was a worthi clerk, He said the Bruce amang his othir werk. In this mater prolixit I am almaist. To my purpos breiffly I will me haist, How gud Wallace was set amang his fayis. To London with him Clyffurd and Wallang gais, Quhar king Eduuard was rycht fayn off that fang. Thai haiff him stad in-till a presone strang. Off Wallace end my selff wald leiff for dredis To say the werst, bot rychtwysnes me ledis. We fynd his lyff was all swa werray trew, His fatell hour I will nocht fen?e new. Menteth was fals and that our weill was knawin. Feill off that kyn in Scotland than was sawyn, Chargyt to byd wndyr the gret Iugement At king Robert ackyt in his parlement. Tharoff I mak no langar contenuans. Bot Wallace end in warld was displesans, Tharfor I ces and puttis it nocht in rym. Scotland may thank the blyssyt, happy tym At he was born, be prynsuall poyntis two. This is the fyrst, or that we forthyr go, Scotland he fred and brocht it off thrillage; And now in hewin he has his heretage, As It prewyt be gud experians. Wys clerkys ?eit It kepis in Remembrans, How that a monk off Bery abbay than, In-to that tym a rycht religious man; A ?ong monk als, with him in ordour stud, Quhilk knew his lyff was clene, perfyt and gud; This fadyr monk was wesyd with seknace, Out off the warld as he suld pas on cace. His brothyr saw the spret lykly to pas. A band off him rycht ernystly he coud as, To cum agayn and schaw him off the meid At he suld haiff at god for his gud deid. He grantyt him, at his prayer, to preiff To cum agayn, gyff god wald geiff him leiff. The spreyt changyt out off this warldly payn, In that sammyn hour com to the monk agayn. Sic thing has beyn and is be woice and sycht. Quhar he apperyt thar schawyt sa mekill lycht, Lyk till lawntryns it illumynyt sa cler At warldly lycht tharto mycht be no peyr. A woice said thus, “God has me grantyt grace, That I sall kep my promes in this place.” The monk was blyth off this cler fygur fayr, Bot a fyr-brund in his forheid he bayr And than him thocht it myslikyt all the lawe: “Quhar art thow, spreyt? Ansuer, sa god the sawe.” “In purgatory.” “How long sall thow be thair?” “Bot halff ane hour to cum and litill mair. Purgatory is, I do the weill to wit, In ony place quhar god will it admyt. Ane hour of space I was demed thar to be And that passis, suppos I spek with the.” “Quhy has thow that and all the layff so haill?” “For off Science I thocht me maist awaill. Quha pridys tharin, that laubour is in waist, For Science cummys bot off the haly gaist.” “Eftir thi hour quhar is thi passage ewyn?” “Quhen tym cummys,” he said, “to lestand hewin.” “Quhat tym is that, I pray the now declar.” “Twa ar on lyff mon be befor me thar.” “Quhilk ii ar thai? The verite thow me ken.” “The fyrst has bene a gret slaar off men. Now thai him kep to martyr in London toun, On Wednysday, befor king and commoun. Is nayn on lyff at has sa mony slayn.” “Brodyr,” he said, “that taill is bot in wayn, For slauchter is to god abhominabill.” Than said the spreyt, “Forsuth this is no fabill. He is Wallace, defendour off Scotland, For rychtwys wer that he tuk apon hand. Thar rychtwysnes is lowyt our the lawe, Tharfor in hewyn he sall that honour hawe. Syn, a pure preist, is mekill to commend. He tuk in thank quhat thing that god him send. For dayly mes and heryng off confessioun Hewin he sall haiff to lestand warysoun. I am the thrid grantyt throw goddis grace.” “Brothir,” he said, “tell I this in our place, Thai wyll bot deym I othir dreym or rawe.” Than said the spreyt, “This wytnes thow sall have. ?our bellys sall ryng, for ocht at ?e do may, Quhen thai him sla, halff ane hour off that day.” And so thai did. The monk wyst quhat thaim alyt. Throuch braid Bretane the woice tharoff was scalyt. The spreyt tuk leyff at goddis will to be. Off Wallace end to her it is pete, And I wald nocht put men in gret dolour Bot lychtly pas atour his fatell hour. On Wednysday the fals Sotherun furth brocht Till martyr him, as thai befor had wrocht. Rycht suth it is, a martyr was Wallace, As Osuuald, Edmunt, Eduuard and Thomas. Off men in armes led him a full gret rout. Wyth a bauld spreit gud Wallace blent about. “A preyst,” he askyt, “for god at deit on tre.” King Eduuard than commaundyt his clerge And said, “I charge, apayn off los off lywe, Nane be sa bauld ?on tyrand for to schrywe. He has rong lang in-contrar my hienace.” A blyst byschop sone present in that place, Off Canterbery he than was rychtwys lord, Agayn the king he maid this rycht record And said, “My selff sall her his confessioun, Gyff I haiff mycht, in-contrar off thi croun. And thou throu force will stop me off this thing, I wow to god quhilk is my rychtwys king, That all Ingland I sall her enterdyt And mak It knawin thou art ane herretyk. The sacrament off kyrk I sall him geiff. Syn tak thi chos, to sterwe or lat him leiff. It war mar waill in worschip off thi croun To kepe sic ane in lyff in thi bandoun, Than all the land and gud at thow has refyd, Bot cowatice the ay fra honour drefyd. Thow has thi lyff rongyn in wrangwis deid. That sall be seyn on the, or on thi seid.” The king gert charge thai suld the byschop ta, Bot sad lordys consellyt to lat him ga. All wyse men said at his desyr was rycht. To Wallace than he rakyt in thar sicht And sadly hard his confessioun till ane end. Humbly to god his spreyt he thar comend, Lawly him serwyt with hartlye deuocioun Apon his kneis and said ane orysoun. His leyff he tuk and to West-monaster raid. The lokmen than, thai bur Wallace but baid On-till a place his martyrdom to tak. For till his ded he wald no forthyr mak, Fra the fyrst nycht he was tane in Scotland Thai kepyt him in-to that sammyn band. Na thing he had at suld haiff doyn him gud Bot Inglismen him seruit off carnaill fud. Hys warldly lyff desyrd the sustenance, Thocht he It gat in-contrar off plesance. Thai xxx?? dayis his band thai durst nocht slaik, Quhill he was bundyn on a skamyll off ayk With Irn chen?eis that was bath stark and keyn. A clerk thai set to her quhat he wald meyn. “Thow Scot,” he said, “that gret wrangis has don, Thi fatell hour thou seis approchis son. Thow suld in mynd remembyr thi mysdeid, At Clerkys may, quhen thai thar psalmis reid For crystyn saullis that makis thaim to pray, In thar nowmyr thow may be ane off thai, For now thow seis on fors thou mon deces.” Than Wallace said, “For all thi roid rahres Thou has na charge, suppos at I did mys. ?on blyst byschop has hecht I sall haiff blis And I trow weill at god sall it admyt. Thi febyll wordis sall nocht my conscience smyt. Conford I haiff off way at I suld gang. Maist payn I feill at I bid her our lang.” Than said the clerk, “Our king oft send the till. Thow mycht haiff had all Scotland at thi will To hald off him and cessyt off thi stryff, So as a lord rongyn furth all thi lyff.” Than Wallace said, “Thou spekis off mychty thing. Had I lestyt and gottyn my rychtwys king, Fra worthi Bruce had rasauit his croun I thocht haiff maid Ingland at his bandoun; So wttraly it suld beyn at his will, Quhat plessyt him, to sauff thi king or spill.” “Weill,” said this clerk, “than thow repentis nocht. Off wykkydnes thow has a felloun thocht. Is nayn in warld at has sa mony slane, Tharfor, till ask, me think thow suld be bane, Grace off our king and syn at his barnage.” Than Wallace smyld a litill at his langage. “I grant,” he said, “part Inglismen I slew, In my quarell me thocht nocht halff enew. I mowyt na wer bot for to wyn our awin. To god and man the rycht full weill is knawin. Thi frustyr wordis dois nocht bot taris me. I the commaund, on goddis halff lat me be!” A schyrray gart this clerk son fra him pas. Rycht as thai durst thai grant quhat he wald as. A psalter buk Wallace had on him euir, Fra his childeid fra it wald nocht deseuir; Better he trowit in wiage for to speid, Bot than he was dispul?eid off his weid. This grace he ast at lord Clyffurd that knycht, To lat him haiff his psalter buk in sycht. He gert a preyst It oppyn befor him hauld Quhill thai till him had done all at thai wauld. Stedfast he red, for ocht thai did him thar. Feyll Sotheroun said at Wallace feld na sayr. Gud deuocioun so was his begynnyng, Conteynd tharwith, and fair was his endyng, Quhill spech and spreyt at-anys all can fayr To lestand blys, we trow, for euirmayr. I will nocht tell how he dewydyt was In v partis and ordand for to pas. Bot thus his spreyt be liklynes was weill. Off Wallace lyff quha has a forthar feill May schaw furth mair with wit and eloquence; For I to this has done my diligence, Eftir the pruff geyffyn fra the Latyn buk Quhilk maister Blayr in his tym wndyrtuk, In fayr Latyn compild it till ane end. With thir witnes the mair is to commend. Byschop Synclar, than lord was off Dunkell, He gat this buk and confermd it him sell For werray trew; thar-off he had no dreid, Him selff had seyn gret part off Wallace deid. His purpos was till haue send it to Rom, Our fadyr off kyrk tharon to gyff his dom. Bot maister Blayr and als Schir Thomas Gray, Efter Wallace thai lestit mony day; Thir twa knew best off gud schir Wil?hamys deid Fra sextene ?er quhill nyne and twentie ?eid. Thocht this mater be nocht till all plesance, His suthfast deid was worthi till awance. All worthi men at redys this rurall dyt, Blaym nocht the buk, set I be wnperfyt. I suld hawe thank, sen I nocht trawaill spard. For my laubour na man hecht me reward. Na charge I had off king nor othir lord. Gret harm, I thocht, his gud deid suld be smord. I haiff said her ner as the proces gais And fen?eid nocht for frendschip nor for fais. Costis herfor was no man bond to me. In this sentence I had na will to le. Bot in als mekill as I rahersit nocht Sa worthely as nobill Wallace wrocht, Bot in a poynt I grant I said amys. Thir twa knychtis suld blamyt be for this: The knycht Wallas, off Cragge rychtwys lord, And Liddaill als, gert me mak wrang record. On Allyrtoun mur the croun he tuk a day To get battaill, as myn autour will say. Thir twa gert me say that ane othir wys. Till mayster Blayr we did sumpart off dispys. Go nobill buk, fulfillyt off gud sentens, Suppos thow be baran off Eloquens. Go worthi buk fullfillit off suthfast deid, Bot in langage off help thow has greit neid. Quhen gud makaris rang weill in-to Scotland Gret harm was it that nane off thaim the fand. ?eit thar is part that can the weill awance. Now byd thi tym and be a remembrance. I ?ow besek off ?our beneuolence, Quha will nocht low lak nocht my Eloquence. It is weill knawin I am a burell man. For her is said als gudly as I can. My spreyt felis na termys of Pernase. Now besek god that gyffar is of grace, Maide hell and erd and set the hewyn abuff, That he ws grant off his der lestand luff.</field>
