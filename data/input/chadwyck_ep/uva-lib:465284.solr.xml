      <field name="fulltext">MOCK POEM, Or, WHIGGS SVPPLICATION. PART I. Argument. Aster invocking of the Muse, As many learned Poets use: Next is describ'd the time of year When Whiggs in Armour did appear, The Good-man's Person, and his Weed, His Armour, Lady, Squire, and Steed, Dog, and Pigeon, and his mind All Allegories, where ye find Clothed with many a sensless word, Mysterious things, not with a turd: As said one in a reverend Coat, Or else he understood them not. As lately, when he Scripture-vext, He forc'd was to say off his Text: And then ye have a supplication Greatly misconstrued of the Nation. At first they dispute how to mend it; And then advise by whom to send it: Where Knight and Squire each other thump, As did De Ruyter and Van Trump. Who ever thou art, Muse, who dost make By force of Brandy, Ale, and Sack, Some who both words and matter want, Admired of the ignorant: In whom sagacious noses snuff; Nought worth but Plagiary stuff, By which they purchase praise and money, When Bees have toil'd, Drons eat the Honey. Inspire me with Poetick surie, That I may likewise favour Currie: VVith all men to augment my Pack, By making Lines not worth a Plack: Some of eight Syllabs, some of ten, Some borrowed from other men: As Cleveland, Don, or Tass Divine, Some ill translated from Marine; Some Oedipus cannot not unridle, Some sounding like a blind mans Fiddle, Observing neither tune nor time, Some nonsense to make up the Rime. Though I speak true, or false, no matter, If I traduce, some others flatter. So sundry men were us'd of late, As they were on or off the State. Grant that I may curb all Backbiters, Of Surplice, High-sleev'd Gowns, and Miters, And Church-governing Paradoxes, Of Calvins followers, and Knoxes. In mystick allegorick tone, Scarce understood by any one. Grant me to scold, revile and prat, Shame fall me, if my self knows what: When Rhime bursts out from breast inrag'd, Like turds from puddings overcharg'd; Some galling, other some to laughter, Moving like Parrat when it's taught her. Hoping my prayer thou wilt hear, O Muse! have at the time of year; When Whiggs from lurking-holes did sally, And in the open fields did rally. It was about the time when Oysters Abound so with venereous moystures, That they are used Even and Morn By those that do their Neighbour horn; Which doth their prices so inhance At Englands Court, and that of France, That Oyster-Wives have money ready To make their Daughter somtime Lady: As doth appear by one of late Whose Son-in-Law bore sway in State. When snow makes dikes and mountains white, When folks by Physick seldom shite, Except there be some Pocky reason; When Mutton weareth out of season, In stead of which, at every meal, When men eat rosted Hens and Veal. And those at Forth eat Garvie Fishes, Then fittest to be serv'd in dishes; Which to the pallat pleasing proves, Like Adriatiq; Gulph Anchoves. When that the Blak bird hoarsly whistles, When Trouts and Abercorn Mussles Are stark nought; when that the Swallow Lyes sleeping in her own tallow, Within some sub-terranean hole; When under the Antarctiq; Pole There is no night, under our other, A man cannot discern his Brother, It is so dark; when Summers heats Scroatcheth the Magellaniq; straits, And burneth up the Corn and Hay About the Caput bonÃ¦ Spei: If that be tedious to remember, It was in Januar, or December, When I did see the out-law Whiggs Ly scattered up and down the Riggs: Some had Hoggers, some Straw Boots, Some uncovered Legs and Coots: Some had Halbards, some had Durks, Some had crooked Swords like Turks: Some had Stings, some had Flails Knit with Eel and Oxen tails: Some had Spears, some had Pikes, Some had Spades which delved Dikes: Some had Guns with rousty Ratches, Some had fiery Peats for Matches. Some had Bows, but wanted Arrows, Some had Pistols without marrows; Some had the Coulter of a Plough: Some Syths had, men and horse to hough: And some with a Lochaber Ax, Resolv'd to give Dalzell his paiks. Some had Cross-Bows, some were Slingers, Some had only Knives and Whingers. But most of all, believe who lists, Had nought to fight with, but their Fists: They had no Collours to display, They wanted Order and Array: Their Officers and Motion-teachers Were very few, beside their Preachers. Without Horse. or Artilzery-pieces, They thought to imitate the Swises; When from Navar they sallied out. Tremovile and brave Trivulce to rout. For Martial Musick, every day They used oft to sing and pray; Which hearts them more when danger comes, Then others Trumpets and their Drums. With such provision as they had, They were so stout, or else so mad, As to petition once again, And if the issue proved vain, They were resolv'd with one accord To fight the battles of the Lord. Upon their head march'd the Good-man, Like Scanderbeg, or Tamerlane. Dame Nature straind her outmost care, To mould him for a man of War: A terrible and a dreadfull foe, As doth appear from top to toe. The shape and fashion of his head, Was like a Con, or Pyramid: Or for to speak in terms more groff, was just like Suggar Loaf: Or like the head of Rob the Cripple, Or like the spear of Magdalen Steeple: Or like the bottom of a Tap, Or like a furr'd Muscovia Cap. They who the South-east Countries haunts, Affirm such heads have Turkish Saints: Which as some learned Writers notes, Are here with us call'd Idiots. Because long hair the wit dot dull, Nought was between Heaven and his Skull: His Ears was long, and stood upright, Which did so well become the Knight: That at some distance he seem'd horn'd, His one eye was with pearl adorn'd; His other eye lookt so a-squint, That it was hard to ward his dint: From thence down to his mouth arose A mountain rather then a nose; Upon which Savage beasts did feed, As Worms, and Selkhorns, which with speed Would eat it up, but he begins In time to pick them out with Pins. His lips were thick, his mouth was wide, His teeth each other did bestride: His tongue was big, though well he meant, He was not very eloquent. His beard was long, and red, and thin, Making a Ball-green on his Chin: As trees do sometime in a Wood, Where Horse and Oxen gather food: His Arms were stiff like Barrow-trams, His Hands were hued like reisted Hams: At Finger-ends he never fails To have the King of Babel's Nails, Which sooner then a Knife, by half, Will cut the throat of Sheep or Calf. When he, not loving to be idle, Turns Cook to any Peny-Bridle. They scrape up Works about his Leagure, A great deal stronger, and far bigger Then those made by Don Pedro Saa, When Spinola besiedg'd Breda. He had a Lump upon his Back, Which some took for a Pedlers Pack: But other some did it suppose A Bagg which kept his Meal for Brose. But neither conjecture was good, It was a lump of Flesh and Blood. His Womb stood out an eln before, As far behind his Bumm, and more: When overcharg'd, it made a sound, Which did like Earthquake shake the ground. With which, as Sentrie, when he sleeps, His Cloaths from Mice and Rats he keeps; Which to his Pockets swarm like Bees, Finding the smell of Bread and Cheese, Which several times the fainting Knight Doth take for Cordials in the night. But when the Beasts do hear the Thunder, They'r so amaz'd with fear and wonder, That to the Gate go Mice and Rats, As fast, as if pursu'd by Cats. Was never man in those Dominions. About whose Legs were more opinions. First, there are many who avow They are like an inverted V. And other some do stiffly jangle, That they and Thighs make a Quadrangle. Some think, that Thighs joyning, they gape, In Circular, or Oval shape: And other some are, who avouch Then Semi-circles in a touch. And other some, there are who tells, They'r Semi-circles paralels. But those who on them better looked, Say one was straight, the other crooked: Not as in touching they did make, That famous Angle of Contact. Which Euclids demonstration shows, If in their Juncture ye put straws. The truth is, they in every thing, Resemble do a Bow and String; The one straight to the other bending, Is like a Chord an Arch subtending: In which Schem, if ye draw some Lines, Ye may have Secants, Tangents, Sines, Which Ale-pot measuring much enables, By help of Logarithmiq; Tables; Which questions soonest do decide, For by Substraction they Divide, And Multiplieth by Addition, As now doth Popish superstition, Which multiplieth every day, Having some added to its way. Their entry to that Church is fine, They Re-baptize them all with Wine, Which their Apostles think far better To wash away mens sins, then water. Now all's describ'd to feet and toes, Which I could not see for his shooes: Some say, his toes, who saw his feet, Resembled an Alphabet, Greek, Syriack, or Arabick, Or Breviations Stenographick; Which they do counterfeit like Apes, With great variety of shapes. You may believe it as your Creed: Such was his Armour and his weed; He wore a pair of Pullion Breeches, A Yellow Doublet with blew Steeches, A long black Cassock over his Ars, As he had been the fool of Mars: He had on each Leg a Gramash, A Top of Lint for his Panash, Which bravely flourish'd in his Crest, A folded Cloak for Back and Breast. A Glove of Plate, which once was worn By Black Dowglas at Bannockburn. For Head-piece, a Cowl lin'd with Iron, Which did his Temples so inviron, That it would cost a world of pains For any to beat out his Brains. A Blunderbush hang'd at his back, Of terrible report and crack; As have a lower Tire of Guns, Shot from a Ship of many Tuns. A Horse he never doth bestride, Without a Pistol at each side: And without other two before, One at either Sadle Tore. But now when he hath much ado, He hath one in each Pocket too. A Sword which woundeth deep and wide, A Target of a seven-fold Hide: A very strange enchanted Lance, Whose touch makes men from Sadle dance As sometimes of old did another, Belonging to Angeliques Brother, And after to the English Duke, As mentions Ariosto's Book. And thus with more Arms he doth ride, Then other twenty had beside. Whether he gain the day, or tine, He never misseth to kill nine: As doth appear to all who reckons, Justly the number of his Weapons. Among ten thousand, all alone, With every Weapon he kills one. Some say, he used to take lives With Whingers, and Kilmarnock Knives: But he thinks that belongs to Boutchers, And others, like DamÃ¦ta's Coutchers. For when with any he doth swagger, He seldome useth Knife, or Dagger: Except they come in wrestling terms, Permitted by the Law of Arms. The Laws of Knighthood he doth keep, Not killing Men like Calves or Sheep. I ask'd at several who he was, Some said he was Sir Hudibras, Deceived by his boulky Paunch: Some said Don Quixot de la Maunch, Which was more like then was the other, In many things he was his Brother. First, in his head were many fancies, Bred by the reading of Romances. He thought before the day of Doom The Covenanters would burn Rome, And trample down the Man of Sin, He thought the work he would begin, And to the glory of his Nation, Accomplish all the Revelation. Prat what they please in Popish Schools, Hammond and Grotius were but fools, Who say, it is fulfil'd already, Must think they prayed to our Lady. They aim'd at Reconciliation, Between the Pope and every Nation. All other things they could pack up, If ye take not from them the Cup: And they had reason, for in truth, Some think they had a burning drouth. Next, like Don Quixot, some suppose, He had a Lady Del to Bose, Who never budged from his side, Upon a pair of Sodds astride: By whose sole industry and care, He manag'd all the holy War. We read in greatest Warriours lives, They oft were ruled by their Wives. The Worlds Conquerour, Alexander, Obey'd a Lady his Commander, And Anthony that Drunkard keen Was rul'd by his lascivious Queen. King Arthur for his VVifes sake, Winkt at Lancelot Du Lake, Though to his opprobry and scorn, He cherisht one himself to horn. They say, that now are many others Who in that case are Arthurs brothers. So the imperious Roxalan, Made the great Turk John Thomsons man. Another Warriour, all his life Was also ruled by his Wife: Albeit before their death arose Some strife between them for her Pose. Thirdly, like Quixot, he a Squire, Had Zancho call'd to whet his ire, When in a fury he did wrestle With Giant, or Inchanted Castle. Or like Don Quixot with Wind-Mills, Or with Dalzel at Pentland-Hills. Or when, like Perseus, he was ready To fight a Monster for a Lady: Being victorious in the strife, He still refus'd the Nymph to Wife; And that with such a modest grace As Fames Knight did the Heir of Thrace: To which Squire, the bounteous Knight Promised either Man, or Wight, Gernsey, or Jersey, or some Isle, With a Lord Governours Style. When he should beat his foes asunder, And bring the Whore of Babel under. Lastly, on Quixot's Rozinant He rode, who took the Covenant. As many think, none of the Nation Could make him take the Declaration. Some endeavour'd to have the Horse Proclaimed Rebel from the Cross, Which though they did with open throats, The Horse eats still his Hay and Oats: Not dreaming that in any thing He Country did offend, or King. The wisest Lawyers of the Nation, Advis'd him to make Appellation; Because it was against all reason To condemn a Beast for treason; Which reason, at a tippling Can, Had sav'd his Master the Good-man: If after his rebellious Journey, He had met with a King's Atturney, VVho could by Law and Reason show, He greater beast was of the two. Or with another, who for riches Stood for incestuous VVhoors and VVitches: Or any other, whom ye list So they did well anoint his Fist. Beside his Horse, he had a Dog, So us'd to traverse Hill and Bog, That he became of scent so cliver, As to miss neither Hare nor Pliver. He turns himself in Horse or Hog, As Monseur did Agrippa's Dog; To find by his sagacious nose, The counterploting of his foes. He treads the Back-scent, brings a Glove, And carries Letters to his Love: He is a fierce Dog, yet most civil, Kills Fish, whose Livers frights the Devil. He barks at Anabaptist, Quaker, Papist, and Declaration-taker: But he will gently fawn, and stand To lick a Covenanters hand. Beside his Dog, he hath a Pigeon, Most do not know of what Religion: She was the same, as many fear, Which once eat Pease in Mahomets ear; VVhich, when she did, the Carl did boast, That he spoke with the Holy Ghost. His Epilepsie for to recover, If once imploy'd, she doth not hover; But will make the whole worlds tour, And come again within an hour: Sometimes she his Orders carries To the Azores, and Canaries: As Quarter-mistriss, to ordain, In which the first Meridian Should lodged be, for Calculation Of Longitudes in Navigation. Sometimes he sends her in Embassage Out through the North-East Indian passage To tell the great Tartarian Cham, A piece of a West-Phalia Hamm Is better meat, when hunger nips, Then Collops off live-Horses Hips: That we who here drink Sack and Brandy, Well tempered with Suggar-Candy, A great deal better then he fares, Who drinks Horse Blood, or Milk of Mares Sometime to Peru, and to Chilly She goes, to tell our Prophet Lilly Forefeeth neither good nor evil, Abandon'd by his Arctiq; Devil; Whom the late great Frost did compell To run and warm himself in Hell. That she might bring from thence a Spirit Of greater foresight, and of merit, For to assist the great Diviner The better for to win his Dinner. Sometime to Turk she goes, and Sophy, To tell their Water and their Cophy, And their severe slighting of Wine, Makes them so with the Collick pine; Which torment is with them so rife, It cost Mahomet the Great his life; For when the Collick he did take, And did refuse a Cup of Sack, He worried on a windy Bubble, And fred the World of meikle trouble. If they'l drink Wine, they need not fear Their Prophet, for his thousand year Are now expired, all in vain They expect his return again. Thus of his Person, Armour, VVeed, His Lady, Squire, and of his Steed, Dog, and Pigeon; for his mind, He leaves all mortals far behind. All things created he doth know, In Heav'n above, and Earth below: He solves the Questions every one That Sheba's Queen ask'd Solomon: Or any other knotty doubt, That can occur the world throughout. Neither doth he prat and bable, Like Pliny Painting out a Fable. At first, he makes a clear Narration, And then backs all by Demonstration. He knows whether the great Megall Doth drink out of his Fathers Skull, Or if he make a Chamber-pot Of that of King of Calcecut. If it be prov'd by any man That he is come of Tamerlan; Or if he keep Tobacco cut In Tortois Shell, or Coco Nut. If the Balm and Franckincense-keepers, By ratling, drive away the Vipers, VVhich with such ardor haunts those Trees, As with us Garden-Flowres do Bees: Or if they do those Serpents choak, As Easterlings their Bees do smoak: VVhich made two great wits, as men think, Spend too much Paper, Pen, and Ink. If Ichneumon and Crocodile Do sight in Niger, as in Nile; Or if we ought to believe them, VVho say, Melchisedec was not Sem; VVhich raised once a Fisty strife Between a Preacher and his VVife. If any man yet ever born Did see Phenix or Unicorn? If there be a Philosopher Stone? If Men who have no Leg but one, VVith broad Soles, which by Toures. Defends their Heads from Sun and Showres? If the Emperor Prester John Be the Off-spring of Solomon? If those who lately conquer'd China, Be the Brothers-Sons of Dina? Who to those North-East parts were turned, When Assur's King Samaria burned. If Romes Founders Wolfs did suck? If Job in Edom was a Duke? If Captain Hynd was a good fellow? If Wallace Beard was black or yellow? Which raised once a great discord Between a Western Laird and Lord. If rosted Eggs be best, or sodden? If James the Fourth was kill'd at Floden? Which made two School-men borrow Swords, That they might fight after big words. If Sword, or Surfeit moe men kill? Who had the better at Edge-hill? Which made two Ladies other jeer, A Round-head and a Cavaleer: Both harped so on the seen ruffle, That it turn'd to a scratch-eye scuffle: At last both conclude to agree, Both of them vowing secresie. Where meets the Brethren of Cross Rosie? What sums the Spaniard in Potosie Gains yearly by their Silver-Mines: Since thirty eight who wins or tines. He knows the price of Jewels and Rings, And hidden causes of sundry things. As of the Compass variation, Of Nile and Nigers inundation. VVhy Ireland wanteth Toad and Snake, VVhy some men white, and some Moors black. VVhy Regulus eye makes men leave breath, VVhy Spiders bite, them dance to death VVhy men Tarantula do not fear, But at some seasons of the year. VVhy Devils musick do not please: VVhat sort of thing is Ambergrease, If Iron Magnes, or it Iron Attract? If Sea or Land inviron That frozen great Magnetick Rock, Under the Pole, where what a Clock There cannot be made any trial, The one year's half, by PhÅbus Dial? By the Seas motion he doth find A North-East passage to the Inde: Another he finds by the North-VVest, VVhere Davies freezed to his rest: VVhen Icy Mountains did occurr, And stopt his course to Mar del Zurr: But he hath found a brave device, That he may free those Seas from Ice; He empties all the VVater, syne He fills the place with Brandy-wine, VVhich hardly will congeal with Frost, If VVhales turn drunk, and Fishing lost; Yet lose we not by that device, For VVhale Oyl we get Indian Spice. All other ways are but a cheat, To fetch some Money from the State. It's wonder they have sharkt so much. Both from the English and the Dutch. He prov'd, on perill of his Soul, Presbyterian-rule by Paul. He thought, none but a foolish man Made Antichrist the son of Dan. He thought by the Apostles meaning, Voice Negative, and sole ordaining, VVas the very mystery Of Antichrist's iniquity, VVhich near his own time did begin To usher in the Man of Sin. He thought, if Bishops had not been, A Pope of Rome had ne're been seen. But now he thinketh Church Government A thing of small, or no concernment: As ready as any ever born For Bishops, if he had not sworn. If Dutch and English truth report, He knows about th' Amboyna Fort, If those two Indian Ships were sunk, And burnt by Dutch, when they were drunk. VVho first began the VVar in Guinie, VVhere Holms and Ruyter play'd at Pinie. If groundless jealousies and fears Yoaks Dutch and English by the ears: Or if it be the Indian Trade Tha doth produce effects so sad. He'l tell in Indian Pedlers faces, VVe dearly buy their Cloves and Maces. The VVar draws blood and money forth; More then the Indian Trade is worth. He thinks the VVar fomented be By Romish craft and policie, VVhich rents the Dutch and us asunder, To bring reform'd Religion under. VVhen both are broken, and brought low, Like Pitchers by a mutual blow, Then they'l force up the Pope again. And make both serve the King of Spain: VVho in the Jesuits fantasie The worlds Temporal Lord will be; And meagre those who countermine them. The Pope and he will rule between them: The world in two Monarchies, He with his Sword, he with his Keyes. If Dutch and English Popish were, They would be Popish every where: So Conclave Fathers do conclude, But such conceits do oft delude. He finds by perfect Demonstrations The roots of all compos'd Ãquations. He finds new ways to poyson Cats, Of Mudd he Serpents makes, and Rats. He finds the Longitude of Places, Makes Bag-pipes with Concording Bases. He finds two means proportionals, VVhich great wits sometime inthrals. In Virtuosies Conventicles, Excentricks, Orbs, and Epycicles He finds to be fantastick fictions, Forg'd, to palliat contradictions; VVherewith the late Star-gazers notions Have involv'd the Planets motions. To determine he dare venture, The Sun to be the VVorld's Center, To hold the Candle in the middle Infix'd, while to Pythagora's Fiddle Still Firmament, with twinkling eyes, The Earth and Planets dancing sees. He Squares, Circles, Doubles, Cubes, Makes most admirable Tubes; If he at Dover through them glance, He sees what hours it is in France; As he hath prov'd by frequent trial, On Steeple, Clock, and Sunny Dial: He reads with them another while Letters, distant twenty Mile; Dutch, or Scots, I know not whether, The one is as like as the other. If he once level at the Moon, Either at Midnight, or at Noon, He discovers Rivers, Hills, Steeples, Castles, and Wind-mills, Villages, and Fenced Towns, With Foussies, Bulwarks, and great Guns, Cavaleers on Horse-back prancing. Maids about a May-pole dancing, Men in Taverns Wine carousing, Beggers by the Hie-way Lowsing, Sojors forging Ale-house brawlings, To be let go without their Lawings, Sturrs in streets by Grooms and Pages, Mountebanks playing on Stages. Wild Boars strouting out their Bristles, Black birds striving who best Whistles, Throats of Larks Trumpeting day, Falcons beating down their prey, Hare and Deer crossing Bogs, Followed at the heels by Dogs, Asses braying, Lyons roaring, Owles screiching, Eagles soaring, Foxes roused from their den, Monkeys imitating men. Gardens planting, Houses bigging, States and Princes Fleets out-rigging; Antick fashions of Apparels, States and Princes pitching quarrels: Wars, Rebels, Horse Races Proclaim'd at several Mercat-places. Capers bringing in their Prizes, Commons cursing new Excizes. Young VVives old Husbands horning, Judges drunk every morning; Augmenting Law-suits, and divisions, By Spanish and by French decisions; Courtiers their aims mising, Chaiplains VVidowâLadys kissing; Men to sell their Lands itching, To pay th' expences of their Kitching. Frequent changes, States invading, Pulpits forcing, and perswading; Great jarrs for Cloves and maces, For Bishops, Lordshps and their Graces: Lords in Stews, missing Purses, VVhile Pages make their Ladys Nurses: Preachers contradicting fast This year, what they Preach'd the last; Making in their Conscience room For a change the year to come; Some seeking Bishopricks in vain, VVishing Presbytry again; Lawyers counsels at such rates, That they cost men their whole estates: VVhat money men puts in their Hands. To get half back, they give their Lands: Physicians cheating young and old, Making both buy death with Gold: Not vers'd in Ãsculapius wayes, Indicative and Critick dayes They make too late, or else too soon, Not knowing the motion of the Moon: Factions in Families and towns, Ground manur'd by Countrey Clowns, In Meadows, Corns, Grapes, Apples, Outbraving Lombardie and Naples; Priests diseased of the Riples, Hirpling through the Streets like Criples, Physicians spoiled with the Pox, Hiding their Noses with their Cloaks, Courtiers covering cankered Faisters With curled Periwiggs and Plaisters, With Wax Noses, Golden Lips, With Paisboard mending Legs and Hips, Using all the Art they can, That they may seem a pretty man, And free of blemish, like a Priest With Urim Thummim on his Breast: Ladies speaking ranting words, Attir'd like Men with Vests and Swords, With Periwiggs and long Locks, Some tax'd for dancing in their Smocks: Making frivolous excuses, Men pretending to the Muses; Some selling Drink, some selling Draff, Some Buffons turn'd, to make men laugh; Some Publicans, some busie medlers, Some turn'd Horse-Coopers, some Pedlers; Some challenged for dreadful things, As stealing Silver Spoons, and Rings; Having us'd many wiles before, That they might put them to the door. Sundry Philosophick Asses By Dictating, Teaching Classes, Not taking an account again, Making Boys spend their time in vain. Some dissipating little Muggs Containing universal Druggs; Physicians crying out amain, Where they cure one, they poyson ten. Some getting Oyster-Boats to Dreg, Some making Satyrs for to Beg, Being reduced to those wants, By several avaricious Saints, Who proved on them Drinking, Whooring, By slandring, forging, and perjuring: At last, for all their fair pretention, Their quarrel prov'd to be a Pention, VVhich having got, then for refuge, They bribe, or cheat a silly Judge, By purloyning, and forbearing, To stop the cause from further hearing. There was no remedy for the evil, All went head-long to the Devil: That Fathers saying is most true, Penitent Clerks are very few: Ere any shame shall them betide, They'l one sin with another hide. His Tube in higher Planets Heaven, Discovers many moe then seven. Jove hath his gaurd, with thunder thumps, To beat down Covenants and Rumps: And Saturn hath his Pages too, VVhen he meets Jove, there is adoo. Its good to some, and bad to other, Its never good to all together: For some go up, and some go down, Some gets, and some will lose a Crown. They say, such things will now appear In less then three and thirty Year. Great change of Government will be, As all affirm beyond the Sea: But all their practises, and wiles At this bout, will not reach our Iles. All is confined to the main, And then it will about again. VVe need not break our hearts for sorrow, VVhat's ours to day, is theirs to morrow. He sees Mars sending Grooms in ire To set the VVorld below on fire; Raising such fury in mens Breasts, That Generals are made of Priests, VVhich them becomes, as all avow, As well as Sadle doth a Sow. He sees those Grooms, who Sun attends, Blowing on their burnt finger-ends: Among whom Mercury doth stand, Serving the Sun with Capp in hand. He hath no dwelling of his own, But is Domestick of the Sun. Phebus and he hath great compassion On Arts now wearing out of fashion: Yet some will flourish, they foresaw Romances, and the Cannon Law. He sees, with Venus Pages are, Who Pimps were to the God of War: When jealous Vulcan, sick of love, Would needs himself a Cuckold prove, Like several great ones here below, Though some conceal what they do know. His Tube once levelled at the Sky, Sundry, yet hid lights doth espy; Some lesser ones, and some more gross, Between the Boars and Southern Cross; Some on Pegasus his Hoove, And Some upon his Masters Love, And some upon her Mothers Chair, And some on Berenices Hair; And some upon the Serpents Sting, Aod some upon the Eagles VVing; And some upon the Rams Horn, Some on the Beard of Capricorn, And some he sees upon the Bull, And some upon Orion's Skull, And some on Nessus mortal foe, And some on Cancer's meikle toe: Some on the Sails of Argo Ship, And some on Antinous Hip; And some he sees upon the Twins, And some upon the Fishes Fins; And some he sees on Libra's Scale, And some upon the Dragon's Tail; VVhich little Bear and Pole entangles, And some he sees on the Triangles: Some on the Harp, some on the Swan, Some on the Crown, some on the Cran, Some on the VVhale, some on the Trout, And some upon the great Dogs Snout; And some upon the Virgins Knees, On Crinita, between her Thighs, Which makes her blush, and turn her look North-East, upon Boote's Dock: Which the base Clown regardeth not, But spurns her backward with his Foot, And almost lames her on the Knee, Which barbarous incivilitie Is evident to any man, By the Glob of Vatican. And finally, that tract of Light Which we see in a Frosty Night, And caused Philosophick jarrs, He finds to be the light of Stars; Which just so shining, he doth mark, As Haddocks Heads do in the dark. Solve several Questions he can, Scarce solvable by any man: If number of Stars be odd or even: What's beyond the outmost Heaven. If substance of the Heav'ns be mix'd, If Stars do move, in Orbs infix'd: Or, if they move, as others clatter, As Fowl in Air, or Fish in Water. Since Jewish Sabbath is begun, And ends with setting of the Sun. How that Sabbath observ'd can be Beyond the sixty eight degree Of Latitude: since Antipods In Sun shining, have such odds. How both Sabbaths observation Jumps with the Sabbath of Creation: The one and other Question Sorely puzzled Solomon, In that great Dispute, that between Was him and that Arabian Queen; Or Ãthiopian, as some other, Who make her Prester John's Mother. Against the late Star-gazers Schism, And Argolus Paralogism; He finds Comets are plac'd no where But in some Region of the Air. He finds with admirable speed Their Paralaxis by a Threed: He finds their eyes perceive not well, Or else Dioptriques make them reel, And that their Brain's not worth a Turd, Who calls them Via Lactea's Curd; The same he thinks of many others, Who say, they are new Stars half Brothers: Of which last, if he espy one, He bids let Gods secrets alone. He finds both Comets and Eclipses, But petty Fortune-telling Gipsies: The like uncertainty he sees In change of Excentricities. But he foresees with Prophets Unction The effects of a great Conjunction; Before the Age begin again, Spain shal have France, or France have Spain The Monarchy shall spread no further, If Dutch and English hold together. And though they do great tribulation, Follows a Gothish inundation, Spreading from Pomer into Scluse, In defence of the Flower de Luce: Their Mutiny for want of Pay Proves to the French a dismal day. Then English shall say, God be thanked, The French are like Fleas in a Blanket, They soon skip out, as they did in, Their Conquest ends ere it begin. They marr all by unstable carriage, As in their old Italian Voyage; When quite forsaken of their helps, They first brought Shankers ov'r the Alps. He doth foresee another wonder, Nations in place, and hearts asunder, Shall straitly be conjoyn'd in one, Against the Whore of Babylon. And though those Nations be but poor, Rich Kings who fornicat the Whoor, Shall melt before them, as the Snow, When Rain and South-wind makes a Thaw. What men they are, he will not clatter, Lest some think he intends to slatter. Then all shall be serene and clear, And Saints shall Reign a thousand year, If not, let it not be forgotten, To hang him when he's dead and rotten. All doubt much of the Jews Conversion, The manner of the Worlds Eversion. If Fire shall burn the Heav'ns to Embers, If separat Souls their Friends remembers: If those new reasons do make good The Circulation of the Blood: If Webbs of Cloth be made of Stones, If Pox can be chas'd from the Bones; If Minerals nourish as Grain, If Ratts once dead can live again: And of such like Resurrections, If by Attractions, and Ejections, Men may lend, or borrow blood; If universal Druggs be good; If Satyr-makers ever thrive, If any thing which they contrive; If there be such of any Nation. VVho are not driven to desperation, Giving to all, who them defends, Still sorest on the finger-ends. Though never wiser man was born, He knows not how to dine the morn: No more then he sees when shall come The moment of the day of Doom. The VVhiggs him circled in a Ring. And he stood like a Nine-pin King; After a Pause and a Cough, And sundry clawings of his Hough: Upon his Tiptoes he arose, And with his Fingers wip'd his Nose, And cleans'd his Fingers on his Breeches, Delivering those following speeches. Hear, O ye remnant of Isra'l, Who have not bow'd your knees to Baal, For which ye undergo the Cross; Ye Gold refined from the Dross; Ye winnow'd Corn purg'd from the Chaff, Ye sp'rit of Malt drawn from the Draff; Who to the good Cause are no shame, Ye Covenanters, Cruds and Cream; Ere one a Pater Noster utter, Some will turn Cheese, and others Butter, And each will feed his hungry Brother, If we shall chance to eat each other. Ye who still pray for these who wrong you, God grant there be no Rogues among you, As Arch as any of the Nation: I have caus'd Pen a Supplication, Which must be sent unto the King, From whom some must an answer bring: I'le read it out, that ye may mend it, And then advise by whom to send it. Then answered the whole Croud, Bidding him read it out aloud. Seeking his Lunets forth, he farted, At which, they who stood nearest started; Those further off took such Alarms, Some cry'd to Legs, some cry'd to Arms: What was the matter, none could think, Till all of them did smell the stink. Then having hush'd their shouts and hollows, He did begin to read as follows. THE SUPPLICATION. Sir, though there be but few among us, Who bids at every word God damn us; Though we come not to martial closes, Half gelded, and without our Noses: As not accustom'd to those tricks, Which hurts mens Noses, and their Pricks: Although we do not rant and swagger, Nor drink in Taverns till we stagger, And then engage in drunken quarrels, VVhere wit goes out by tooming Barrels; Where some throw Stoops, and others Glasses, Some struggle with the serving Lasses; Some throw a Chandler, some a Can, Some strive to Cuckold the Good-man. Some mean their Elbow, some their Head, Some cry, alace, their Shoulder-blade; And some with spilled drink are dreeping, And some sit on a Privy sleeping: Some do not know at whom they'r striking, And some are busie Pockets picking: Some have their hair with fingers freezed, And some cry out, they'r Circumcised. Some have their Faces and their Throples All scratched with Tobacco Stoples: Some Coals with naked Swords are hewing, And some ly in a Corner Spewing; And other some get bloudy Fingers, By grasping naked Knives and VVhingers, VVhen they the fray intend to redd, VVhen it were better they were a-bed: And some cry, ye disturb the Laird, And some cry, fy bring Baily Baird, A man who is obliged much Unto the War against the Dutch. At that they call the Wench to reckon, She comes and counts up three for one, But gains not much, though she so trick it, Beside her loss of Burges Ticket: They tell her, they will money borrow, And come and pay their Shot to morrow: Their Officers, the other day, Had Dyc'd, &amp; Drunk, and Whoor'd their pay. Sir, though we do not play such pranks, For which we give unto God thanks; Yet we your loyal Subjects are, To serve you both in Peace and War, With our Fortunes, and our Lives; But if our Conscience, and our Wives By any man be medled with, We'l both defend with all our pith. Sir, our conscience to compel, Is to force our Souls to Hell. If we do good, and think it evil, In that we more obey the Devil, Then doing ill, which we think good, If holy Writ be understood. Sir, we have been sore oppressed, Our Wives and Serving Lasses Sessed, Either to give beyond their reach, Or else hear some Hirelings Preach: Who Preach nought else, but rail and rant Against the Holy Covenant: And yet its known, that the Nation Did take it, at their instigation; For which, of late, they were so hearty, When it was the prevailing party, That they urg'd State, as they were wood, To take some's Means, and others blood: And others they compel'd to flee, And hide themselves beyond the Sea: And that, Sir, for no other reason, But Ante-Covenanting Treason. But now, Sir, when the guise doth turn, They Preach nothing, but hang, and burn, And harry all those of the Nation, Who do refuse the Declaration: Perswading us with tales and fictions To take Oaths which are contradictions; Having, for love of VVorldly Pelf First taken contrair Oaths themself. At the first, Sir, God be thanked, VVe sold Covering, Sheet, and Blanket, And Gowns, and Plaids, and Petticoats, Meal and Pease, Barley and Oats, Butter and Cheese, and VVool Fleeces, For Groats and Fourty Peny pieces; Capons and Hens, and Geese and Piggs, Oxen and Horse which Till'd our Riggs; And which our very hearts pierces, Master Zachary Boyd's Verses, Dickson's Sermons, Guthrie's Libels, Bessie of Lanerk, and our Bibles, And learn'd Religion by tradition, VVhich smells of Popish superstition: To pay our Fines we were so willing, Which was for each fault Twenty Shilling: Though we alledg'd for our defence, It was too much by Eighteen Pence. At last, we had no more to give, Neither knew we how to live; They felled all our Hens and Cocks, And rooted out our Kail Stocks, And cast them ov'r the Dikes away, And bid us, jeering, fast and pray. Being incensed with such harms, VVe were necessitate to Arms; And through the Countrey we did come, VVe had far better stay'd at home. VVe did nothing but hunt the Glaiks, For after we had got our paiks, They took us every one as Prizes, And condemn'd us in Assizes, To be hang'd up every where, And fix'd our Heads up here and there. Once dreadful Heads, Sir, all did doubt them, They had so meikle wit about them. And we, who scapt those grievous Crosses, Did hide our selves in Bogs and Mosses: Where we fed on sodden Leather, Mingled with crops of Heather; Which, our hunger to asswage, VVe thought most savoury Pottage; For Drink, it was no small matter, If we got clear, not muddy Water; In which, we heartily do wish There be none who desire to Fish; That by the Devils instigation, Brings on us all this tribulation. When in that case we could not stand, We Sally, Sir, with Sword in hand; Let men cry, Rebels, till they grow hoarse, VVe're Subjects nev'r a white the worse. Though we prefer you not to God, VVho do so, Sir, their Faith will nod, If Government take changing tours, They will renounce both you, and yours; As doth appear by some of late, When that Usurper rul'd the State: They strove, Sir, to be sent apace To abjure you in the Worlds face. Though some, Sir, of our Duniwessles Stood out, like Eglingtoun and Cassils, And others, striving to sit still, VVere forc'd to go against their will: Yet other some, as all men knows, VVho should be sent, were near to blows; That is, at very boystrous words, Putting their hands upon their Swords, To make men think that they were stout, VVhen it was known the World throughout, To fight your foes, when they were sent, They alwayes took the Bog a-sclent, And running from the fight by stealth, VVould then sit down and drink your health: And since they could not think, like Asses, To beat your foes by drinking Glasses; It's evident, Sir, as we think, They drank your Health for love of Drink. Yet many, Sir, were disappointed, Who so forsook the Lords Anointed; They were not all alike regarded, Some well, and some were ill rewarded: They who play'd best with both the hands Inrich'd were by their Neighbours Lands. Some from their Creditors got refuges Some were made Clerks, and others Judges: Some swearing their Stocks were spent, Strove to get down their Anualrent: Detaining, Sir, by that extortion, The Fatherless and Widows portion, Which Usuring Fathers Lent to Lairds, Who play'd it all at Dice and Cards: Which forc'd some Lasses to miscarriage, Because they could not get a Marriage. But among those of stricter life, The truth-tell-colour grew so rife, That it marr'd all the Charms and Graces Of those who could not paint their Faces. But other some got mocks and scorns, By giving to their Land-Lords Horns, And spewing Claret, mull'd with Eggs, Between the Lord Protectors Leggs, When they did endeavour to pray Before him, on a Fasting-day. Some Whally's Bible did begarie, By letting flee at it Canarie, Taking it up, where it lay next, That they might read on it the Text; When Cromwel Preach'd with great applause The Revelation of his Cause: And some of them empawn'd their Cloaks, And other some brought home the Pox: Giving foul Linnings all the wite, Some turn'd your friends for meer despight; Vowing you never to withstand Again, without something in hand. And some turn'd Ordinance-forsakers, Others for grief of heart turn'd Quakers: Some in their Conscience took remorse, Crying, I'm damn'd, till they grew hoarse, And made the standers by admira To see them take the fits of Spira. To bring those troubled Souls to peace, Some reads Alvarez helps to grace; Some Sanctuary of a troubled Soul, Some cited Passages of Paul: Explaining well what he did say; Some reads on Mr. Andrew Gray: Some told the danger of back-sliding, Some the good of Faith abiding; Some reads the Cases of Richard Binning, Some Fergusson reads of Kilwinning: And some them pressed very sore To hear a little of Doctor More: But others cry'd, Away, and Tush VVith Vipers in a Balmy Bush? VVith blind Pilots, guiding Ferries, VVith Toads lurking in Straw-berries. His Doctrine of Justification Drives all the Court to Desperation. Few there are saved, as we guess, By their inherent righteousness. He hath some good among great evils, He tells of Bastard getting Devils Of their Bodies, or Vohicles, Their Herauldry and Conventicles. It's sport to see his fancy wander In their Male, and Female Gender. He doth so punctually tell The whole Åconomy of Hell, That some affirm he is Puck Hary, Some, he hath walked with the Fairy. Though Intellectuals be neat, Though he mean well, and is no cheat, His case is desperat and sad, For too much Learning makes him mad. VVe'll read on the True Converts Mark, Or we will read on Bessie Clark, Or else on Bakers Heavenly Beam, Or on the Lady Culross Dream; Which sundry drunken Asses flout, Not seeing the Jewel within the Clout. Like Combs of Cocks, who takes no heed When they Gower, or Chaucer read. When they had said, and read their fill, It did not cure the Patients ill: They still cry on, and howl, and mourn, Their counsels would not serve the turn. No comfort at all find they can, Until a Grave and Reverend Man Advise them to resist temptation, With Spainish Wine, and Fornication. Those Rebels also to obey, Those Hirelings ceas'd for you to pray; Because their Stipends, and their Living Were at the foresaid Rebels giving. They thought a man a venial sinner Who left sworn duty for his dinner: Yea, some of them were of opinion, They might pray for that Devils Minion. They would not stick for love of Pelf, To pray, Sir, for the Devil himself: But we, in the Usurpers faces, Remembred you in Prayers and Graces; And if we had had Guns and Swords, Our actions would have back'd our words. Our fault, Sir, was, for which we moan, We thought to do it all alone. Since it was only want of wit, Since it was a distraction-fit, We pray you, Sir, be no despiser Of us, whom God hath made no wiser. Royal Sir, to those our times Apply'd may be a Poets Rhimes, Who coursly singeth, that a Wight Obeying King, in wrong or right; If that the King to wrack shall go, VVill in like manner turn his foe: But who obey no sinful thing, Do still prove constant to their King. The Rhime is barbarous and rude, But, Sir, the saying's rich and good; In Print yet forth it hath not crept, VVe have it in a Manuscript: The Good-man keeps it, as we think, Behind a Dish, upon the Bink: And yet it's thought by many a man Most worthy of the Vatican. It's worthy, Sir, of your Saint James That stands upon the River Thames. Ye'll not find saying such another, Put all their Guilded Books together: Tho with these two ye joyn in one The Bibliotheck of Prester John. Cause Pages cry it still before ye, As Philip did Memento mori. Since then we Arm for Conscience sake, May't it please you, Sir, some pity take, And not by Bishops instigation Inforce on us the Declaration, Nor make us give, beyond our reach, To keep's from hearing Hirelings Preach; Who last year Preached Oaths to take, And this year Preacheth them to break: When they have forced men to take them, Then first of all, themselves they break them. Except God, Sir, their manners mend, They'l oath it to the Worlds end. Men either must foreswear themself As oft as they turn Coats for Pelf, Or else their Conscience is so scurvie, They will turn all things topsie turvie. And we will give what we can reach To keep's from hearing those men Preach, As Achisons, Balbies and Placks, Which is enough, Sir, for our packs. Likewise, in any other thing VVe will obey you, as our King, If ye require it at our hands, VVe'll quite to you both Lives and Lands. Nothing to fight can us compell, Except to keep our Souls from Hell; VVhat ever mischief us befall, Or else the Devil take us all. Ye need not, Sir, distrust, or fear, VVhen Out-Law-VVhiggs do Ban, or Swear; It doth unto the VVorld appear, Keeping our Oaths hath cost us dear. VVe pray God, that Your Majesty, And then Your Royal Progeny, May peace and truth with us defend, As Kings, unto the Worlds end. VVe with all duty and respect Your gracious Answer do expect. A Debate between the Knight and Squire, about the mending of the Petition, and who should carry it to the King. And thus the Supplication ended, The Squire cry'd out, it should be mended: Being desir'd to tell the cause, First with all ten his Arse he claws, And then his Elbow, and his Head, VVinking a while, as he were dead; And clapping both Hands on his Snout, At last his reason tumbled out; To wit, it did not move to grant Renewing of the Covenant. Knight. At which the Knight gave such a groan, As would have rent a heart of stone: And casting both his eyes to Heaven, He said, not though the Earle of Levin Were on our heads, we durst not do it, It's base to put the King so to it: It is a most presumptuous thing, To cross the Conscience of a King. Some honest men did never take it; Some honest also were who broke it; But he who breaks't against his light, Let it be wrong, let it be right, By Prophets and Apostles leave We dar aver his a knave. On singulars we will not harp, For the apply will be to sharp. We put down Bishops, to our cost, Yet two or three still rul'd the Rost; Some of which play'd such pranks at home, As never Pope presum'd at Rome. It is the simplest of all tricks To suffer fools have Choping Sticks. A Sword put in a wood mans hand, Bredd meikle trouble to the Land. Squire. The Squire reply'd, they'r scarce of news, Who tells, their Mother haunted Stews. Who on his Brother rubs disgrace, He spits upon his Mothers face. Each Covenanter is our Brother, The Covenant, of all is Mother. Their wit is dull, and very gross, Who think where Gold is, there's no Dross: Where there is Corn, there may be Chaff, Where there is Malt, there may be Draff: Thistles with Corn grow on the Riggs, And Rogues may lurk among the Whiggs. And Friars in Lent may be Flesh-eaters, And Covenanters may be Cheaters, And Weeds grow up with fairest Flowres, And sighing Sisters may be Whoors. As Fruit on Trees grow, so grow Leaves, Its certain Bishops may be Knaves; Its known to all, the Devil may dwell In some of fourteen, as of twell. To blame a Cause for Persons Vices, Is one of Satans main devices, By which he very oft doth make VVell-meaning men the truth forsake. But let us first the Question state, Before we enter in debate, VVhich of the two should bear the sway, The Miters, or the Elders Lay. Knight. The Knight did pause a pretty while, Then answered with a scornful smile, I tell thee, fool, I think Government Of Church, a thing of small concernment: The truth it's uery hard to find, It puzzleth the learnedst mind. Some do the Presbytry conceive New forg'd by Clavin at Geneve; Some say, he puts to execution Paul the Apostles Institution, Which suffered exile and ejection, The time of Pauls foretold defection. Some say, since Bishops did appear, Its more then Fifteen hundred year; Some say, that then they did begin The Pope of Rome to Usher in: That Pauls iniquities, mystery working, Was men, then for precedency forking. Some Presbyterians do conclude, But Bishops say, such thoughts delude: VVhich comes from brains which have a Bee, Like Urquharts Trigonometrie. Some Bishops prove by Scripture-phrazes As by the word ??????????? How John the Angels seven did greet, Why Paul did Titus leave in Creet. But other some boldly asserts, Who reason so, the Text perverts. Some call the Bishops Weather-Cocks, Who where their Heads were turn their Docks. Still stout for them who gives them most, And who will make them rule the Rost. Some say, that Bishops have been good, And seal'd the Gospel with their blood; As ready for the truth at call, As any Whigg among us all. Perhaps a railing foolish Ranter Will tell a Bishop Covenanter An honest Clergy-man will be, When Cable passeth Needles eye: For some of such had play'd a pavie, Though all the Cables of the Navie In one, should pass through Needles-eye, Whiggs still would doubt their honesty. Some say, a Bishop Covenanter, If a penitent repenter, Causeth more joy to Sp'rits Divine, Then all the other ninety nine. Some Father Tales upon King James, To sundry Presbyterian Dames, That he was forc'd of Knaves to make them, For Devil an honest Man would take them. Some say, the King gave never leave To make a Bishop of a Knave. That those men are evil speakers, Tax'd by Jude, spiritual Quakers: That none doth hate Nobility; For Quakers blaming Herauldry. And some again are, who compares Our Bishops unto Baiting Bears; Who, if they be not kept in aw, They will tear all with teeth and paw: Yet tractable in every thing, If in their Snout ye put a Ring. And many men again there be VVho say the same of Presbytrie; And some say this, and some say that, And some affirm, they know not what. Its grief to see them Scripture vex, And wrest it, like a Nose of VVax; And he who is deceived most All Fathers on the Holy Ghost: Some quiting Prophets and Apostles, Thinks best to plead the Cause by Postills: And some do dispute by Tradition, Some calls that Popish Superstition; And some affirm, that they had rather Follow a Counsel, then a Father: And some affirm, it buits not whether, They are blind Leaders all together. And since the truth is found by none, No more then is that turn Gold Stone, It's best, Zancho, for ought I see, To take a Pint, and then agree. Let men have Bishops at their ease, And hear what Preachers best them please; If we be fred of Declaration, And of that other great vexation We mentioned in our Petition, We'll alter it on no condition; Then we will serve the King as much Against the Dane, and French, and Dutch, As any in his three Dominions Who hateth us, or our opinions: If he command us, we will come Like Goths, and Scale the Walls of Rome, And bereave Babels Whore of breath, Or die the Duke of Bourbon's death. Squire. The Squire made many odd Grimass Ere he could speak, like Balaams Ass; Sometime he wink'd, sometime look'd up, And running backward like a Tupp, For to return with greater force, He snorted like a very Horse; One thought upon another tumbled, One while he grin'd, another grumbled. At last, like Cant, or Trail, or Durie, He gave a Broad-side in a fury: Looking as he would eat them all, His words flew out like Cannon Ball. The love of Pelf comes from the Devil, It's root of all mischief and evil: It makes Lords sup without a Candle, When none can see their Knife to handle: While to bring Candles Servants lingers, Ten Candles will not heal their Fingers. It makes Fore-heads and Shins to bleed, By saving Candle, to light to Bed. It makes them keep their Cellar Keys, Set secret marks on Hamms and Chese; Which, if but in the least defaced, Wives, Servants, Bairns are all menaced. It makes them prigg for Milk and Eggs, Put in a Broth Cocks, halfs, and Leggs: It makes them Clout Elbows and Breasts, Keep Rinded Butter in Charter Chests, Till Ratts eat all their Law-defences, And Families old Evidences: It makes them pay their Masons Wages By Usury, on VVedds, and Gadges Taken from VVidows, who were plundred, By paying Fourty in the Hundred. It corrupts Hamell, Sharp, and Sweet, It poysons all, like Aconite: If it touch Hide, it goes to Heart, And so affecteth every part. The great ones do betray their trust, Ladies throw Honour in the dust, Like those who troad the Cyprian Dance VVith that Financier of France. It Puritans doth make of Ranters, And Cavaleers of Covenanters; Of Lords and Earls it makes Drapers, Of Priests and Levites it makes Capers. It maketh grave and reverend Cheats In Pulpits, and Tribunal Seats: For any Crime it finds defences, With Oaths, it like a Pope dispences: It causeth among Brethren strife, It makes a Man Pimp to his Wife: It makes yeeld Fortresses and Towns Sooner then Armies with great Guns: It sets a-fire Cities and Streets, It raiseth Tragedies in Fleets; It makes the vanquished victorious; And foyl then victory more glorious: It makes rebellion rise and fall, And hath such influence on all, That whom it made rebellious Nurses, It loyal makes, to fill their Purses: It causeth many a bloody strife, When needy male-content grow rife: Then by it Church and State are mended, And will be till the world be ended. Master, we all observe and mark, Since ye once doubt, ye will embarque. Why do ye Conscience so neglect? Or, what, Master, can ye expect? Although among the Whiggs ye Preach, A Bishoprick ye cannot reach: For Bishopricks are giv'n to none Like Presbyterian John Gillon, Who, when he takes his Preaching-turn, Will make moe laugh then he makes mourn. Ye have infus'd in us Sedition, Ye will us leave in that condition: And then cause Print a Book of Season, Tax whom ye have seduc'd of Treason. And when so doing, all men see, Ye sing the Palinod of Lee. The Cavaleers will still you call The Archest Rebel of us all. Thus having said, he made a halt, And stood, like Lots Wife turn'd to Salt, With Ear attentive, earnest Eye, He did expect the Knights Reply. Knight. Who stroak'd his Beard, and bit his Lip, And wip'd his Nose, and scratch'd his Hip, He wry'd his Mouth, and knit his Brows, He changed more then twenty hues; His Hands did tremble, his Teeth did chatter, His Eyes turn'd up, his Bumm did clatter, His Tongue on Teeth and Gumes did hammer, He fain would speak, but still did stammer: His Garb was strange, dreadful, uncouth, Till through his Epileptick Mouth Those following speeches fierce and loud Burst out, like Thunder through a Cloud. Thou poysons all, my little Grex, Thou sentence-speaking Carnifex: Thou hardy and presumptuous are To meddle so with Peace and War; Rub my Horse Belly, and his Coots, And when I get them, dight my Boots; For they are better then Gramashes For me, who through the Dubbs so plashes: Yet I'le wear none, till I put on Those of the Priest of Livingston; Who, when they hid them in the Riggs, Said they were plunder'd by the Whiggs, Unto another Priest, his Marrow, Who sent a Maid his Boots to borrow, Whose Boots were plundered indeed, As was his Salt Beef, and his Steed Teach what I please, thou'lt not forbear To meddle with things without thy Sphear; Like Taylors making Boots or Shoos, Or like Shoo-makers making Hose. Like some I know, as blind as Owles, Playing at Tennice, and at Bowles, And sometime Shooting at a Mark, Like Passavantius playing the Clerk, Who medled with, he knew not what, That he might get from Rome a Hat. Men oft by change of station tynes, Good Lawyers may prove bad Divines: Like Sadoleto's Dog in Satine, Like Ignoramus speaking Latine: Which raised most unnatural jarrs, As between Law and Gospel Wars. Like Bembo's Parrat singing Masses, Like men of seventy Courting Lasses; Like Highland Lady's knoping Speeches. When they are scolding for the Breeches, Like Massionella freeing Naples From Gabells put on Roots and Apples. Like Taylours scanning State concernments, Or Coblers clouting Church Governments. Like some attempting tricks in Statiques, Not vers'd in Euclids Mathematiques. Like Pipers mending Morleys Musick, Or Gardners Paracelsus Physick. Like Atheists pleading Law refuges; Like Countrey Treisters turning Judges. Like Preachers stirring up devotions, By Preaching Military motions; Proving their uses and didactiques, By passages of Ãlians tactiques. Like Ladies making Water standing, Like young Lairds, Horse &amp; Foot commanding. Like Monckeys playing on a Fiddle, Or Eunuchs on a Ladies middle. Like Gilliwetfoots purging States By papers thrown in Pocks or Hats, That they might be, when purg'd from dung Secretaries for the Irish Tongue. Great wounds, yet curable, still faister. When fools presume to rule their Master; As sad experience teach'd of late, When such reformed Church and State: Though all the Publick did pretend, All almost had a privat end. There was no place of War, or State, But was by twenty aimed at; Whereof ninteen were disappointed, Which made the Body whole disjoynted; And rais'd among them such divisions, That they were to their friends derisions. Some aim'd at the Embroidered Purse, Some the Finances to deburse, And other some thought to be getters By writing of the Privy Letters: Some aim'd at Privy Seal, or Rolls, Some Customs gathered in, and Tolls: Some did dry Quarterings enforce, Some lodg'd in Pockets Foot and Horse: Yet still Bogg-sclented, when they yoaked, For all the Garrison in their Pocket: And some made men Morgage their Lands, To lend Money on publick Bands, To be pay'd at the Resurrection: Some Fines pay'd who oppos'd defection; Some sold the Souldiers Mity Meal, And some did from the Publick steal; And some, as every body says, Us'd more then other twenty ways: Yet notwithstanding of all that, They were lean Kine devouring fat. None gained by those bloody fairds, But two three Beggers who turn'd Lairds; Who stealing publick Geese and Wedders, Were fred, by rendering Skin and Feathers. When others of this Church and Nation Returns unto their former station: And now, for all their stomacks stout, Comes home more fools then they went out. Thou, like a Fire-brand, dost advise Us to be fools, when all are wise: Thy endeavours are all in vain, Ere we shall play such pranks again, The Patagons shall Masses mumble, The Dons of Spain shall all be humble, Italians shall speak as they think, Germains, when Sun's set, shall not drink; Swedds gaining day, shall not pile Baggage, And English hate shall Beef and Cabbage, The Russ and Pole shall never jarr, Danes shall gain by a Sweddish War; Victorious Turk shall stand to reason, Scots shall be beat, and not blame treason; The Dutch shall Brandie slight, and Butter, And England Conquer by De Ruytter: The first burnt ardor of French hearts Shall not turn to a rack of farts, And they shall spell as they do speak, And they shall sing as they do prick: With Oaths they shall not lard their Speeches, Nor change the fashion of their Breeches. All shall have for assured news, That Pope from Rome have banish'd Stews: Rebellion shall return from Hell; And do things which I will not tell. Though it were true, as some compares Our Bishops unto baiting Bears, Who, if they be not keept in aw, They will tear all with Teeth and Paw. Yet many utterly mislikes, That Butcher Presbyterian tycks Should flee upon their throats and faces, To curb their Lordships, and their Graces: His Majesty, without all doubt, Should only Ring them in the Snout. If they so swell, that none can bide Their malice, avarice, and pride; Vices, which all the world doth ken Familiar to Clergy-men; Of which, though palliat with art, Our own Presbytry had their part. Our duty is, with all submission, To press the grant of our Petition: The King will suffer us, perchance, As Lewis doth Huggonots in France: And in his Wars, Civil and Forraign, Make me Command in Chief, like Turrain. And though he grant not our demands, Away with Covenants and Bands; Kings must command, we must obey, They Rebels are, who truth gain-say. Some tell, we must the truth so love, As of it not to quite a hoove. As said another fool, thy marrow, As if his Majesty were Pharo. For my part, ere I trouble peace, I'le Bishops call, My Lord and Grace; And kneel at the Communion Table, Make Christmas-Feasts, if I be able: Privat Sacraments I'le avow Childrens confirming I'le allow; And I will hear the Organs play, And Amen to the Service say. I'le Surplice wear, and High-sleev'd Gown, And to the Altar I'le bow down. Yea, ere his Majesty be wroth, I'le Primat be, and Chancellor both. Squire. The Squire replyed in a chaff, He girn'd so, that he seem'd to laff: And when ye travel in Carosses, Ye will salute the Hie-way Crosses; And when with danger ye are prest, Ye will cross, sign fore-head and breast, And ye will to our Lady pray, And travel on the Sabbath day; And ye will play with Lords and Lairds All Sermon time at Dice and Cards; And Duels fight, like those of France, And drunk and Creeple lead a dance, And ye will venture Ax and Rope, By writing Letters to the Pope, To tell him, though ye here by Haman, Ye worship with the King, like Naman, And then accuse us all of Treason, When ye put out your Book of Season. Knight. The Knight look'd fiercely then about, Thus thundering with a dreadful shout, Constant madness thy Brains inthrals, Thou hast no Lucid Intervalls. Thy Waspish Tongue will never fail To prat, to scold, revile and rail: Though men should bray thee all to Powder, Thou still, Theristes, plays the louder. All honest and unbyass'd ken Those whom thou means't, were worthy men; They had some faults, though not so big, As rotten Flees, to spoil a Pigg Of Ointment; sooner it is known, We others faults see, then our own. Presbyterian, never one Faultless, at them could cast a stone. It's certain, it comes from the Devil, To hide men's good, and tell their evil: They never learned that of Paul, Or David, when he mourn'd for Saul. Thou art a Cocks-comb, void of reason, To tell me of a Book of Season: Thou learnd'st when thou kept Sheep &amp; Hogs, With one Stone for to hit two Dogs. Though thou spue Venom like a Toad, That Book is much esteem'd abroad. Squire. The Squire replyed, many deem Beyond Sea it is in esteem: When once it passed Pentland Firth, It rais'd among them such a mirth, That some for laughter burst their Rheens, And other some did split their Spleens: They cherish'd it in every School, To be their Bibliotheca's fool; When serious reading health did spill, That they might read and laugh their fill: Physicians it prescrib'd to men As Cure approved for the Spleen: At Publick Meetings, and at Feasts, It was the Topicks of their Jests. Some say, since known, all his life To have had with the Bishops strife: Since for the Covenant none more wood, To make three Nations swim in blood: Since he spar'd none whom he could reach, Who 'gainst the Engagement did not Preach: Since to the Cause he stuck so fast, Since Bishops was restor'd at last, That in the Pulpit he did grant A Bishop was the Devils plant. Giving to all his hearers leave, If ever he turn'd, to call him Knave. And since, as every body says, He chang'd in less then twenty days: It's very like, at others budding, He turn'd his Coat for Cake and Pudding. Some say, he is a sounding Brass, Which signifies a pratling Ass: He brings no reason which can bind, But only fights against the wind. It's clear, that it doth with him fare As with Sampson without his Hair. Before his change his Wit was tough, And he could reason well enough: But now he kytheth like a fool, As one would whipp a Boy at School, To vent in Print so little reason, And call it an Advice in Season. Some say, that he treads Bishops Path, As David serv'd the King of Gath. Though men to censure him be rash, He gives the Bishops such a dash, They need not brag their cause is won By the Foster of Henderson. Some say, he Bishops doth betray, That Presbytry may gain the day, Who fed him for their Champion hidden, Others affirm, they are out-bidden; Which makes him take a contrair task, As Edward answered once Southesk. A modest man wrot in a Letter, He might have pleaded meikle better. The charitable do not fear, But for a thousand Merks a year He would the Bishops yet withstand, If Covenanters rul'd the Land. Knight. Then said the Knight, though in a Morter I bray this Fool, to no Exhorter Thou wilt give ear; he'll put thee to it. Squire. To whom the Squire, what though he do it, Both Reason there and Justice halts, Where one's blam'd for anothers faults. Was never Judge did things so foul, Except himself, once at Saint Rule: He forg'd Records, and them Enacted To bear false Witness, when Extracted. I cannot tell, till I advise, Whether he did it twice or thrice. Next, I will tell that he gave leave If ever he turn'd, to call him Knave, But he can challenge no reflection Put on him at his own direction: He is oblidg'd to keep his word As well as one who wears a Sword. But if he chance to be so wroth, As to break Word, as well as Oath, I'le tell him, I take frantick fits, And am distracted of my wits, As he, and others said of late, When they misguided Church and State. And I them tax'd of forg'd Records, As I can prove before the Lords; If that succeed not, it effeers That I be judged by my Peers, That is, by fifteen Poetasters, Half Fools, half Beggers, half Burlesquers: All of them proved, Drinkers, Whoorers, By Preachers, Forgers and Perjurers. Ere such a Jury can be gotten, Its certain, I'le be dead and rotten; Or if Justice so shall halt, As to cause hang me for his fault; Hanging to me will be less trouble, Then worrying on a windy Bubble At a Dike-side, or under a Stair, If Weather be not very fair. Knight. But then the Knight, we hear, he'l quarrel, That thou once served Albemarle. Squire. To which the Squire, I have no fears, He dar not challeng't for his ears; For I can make appear to all They toss'd me to him like a Ball. Next, ask that Duke, in any thing If ever I did prejudge the King. I forc'd was to dissimulation, To shun a Rope, and serve my Nation: I did no evil, but meikle good, Saving mens Money, and their Blood; Which services I did for nought, Which were from men far richer bought. That Duke can tell, he did suspect it, Albeit to try, he did neglect it: When by their Crafty instigation; He urg'd was to my accusation. They all tell now of Albemarle, But they told him another quarrel, In pleading I could touch a string, Whose sound will make their ears to ring Knight. The Knight said, tush, they'l no more sturr, Then Moon, when bark't at by a Curr. For all thy prat, on no condition I mind to alter the Petition. Squire. Then said the Squire, if ye'l not mend it, Advise at least, by whom to send it, Since we Petition for Religion, Your Lady, or your Dog, or Pigeon Were fittest to be sent, if other, I'm sore afraid we lose a Brother: For I dar swear upon th' Evangel, When he hath got from each his Angel, To help his charges to defray, The Fellow will us all betray. Knight. When things succeed not, fools do slite, Giving betraying all the wite, Reply'd the Knight, they said of late They were betray'd, when they were beat; And they said true, who did not stand, Betrayed are by heart and hand But to the point, as for my Wife, I'le never send her in my life; For fear some Courtier or other Would make me old King Arthurs Brother. My Dog is an unruly Curr, And at the Court will keep a sturr, Seeing Conformists up and down, He barks so at a High-sleev'd Gown, That Bishops either will cause stone him, Or else yoak Boutcher Dogs upon him. As for my Pigeon, it cannot be, She hath another gate to flee: A Message she hath tane in hand, To search for that most happy Land, Unknown to any heretofore, But only to Sir Thomas More: Where we intend to fix Plantation, If forc'd to change our Habitation. And since a Poet rightly hits, That greatest fools have greatest wits, To shun self-dealing, it is fit To choose one not outgrown in wit; So he can Buffonize, and Jest, At publick Meeting, and at Feast, And catch a time to tell the truth, Like Davids great Grand-mother Ruth. The Whiggs with an applauding hollow Cry'd out, his counsel they would follow: Which once concluded, all arose, And set on Pans to make their Brose. When after that some fools were named To be employ'd, they all were blamed: And none thought fit, they still enquire, And find none fitter then the Squire: On him then they enforc'd the Message, When he went out on his Embassage, How at the Court he did arrive, How to affront him they did strive: But how the Buffons all he outted; How Hudibras his Squire he routed, When they two yoaked by the Ears About the baiting of the Bears: And how he manag'd every thing, And how he harrang'd to the King: And how he cited ends of Verses, And sayings of Philosophers; At which some laugh'd, and some were vex'd, Ye'l be advertis'd by the next. FINIS. PART II. When Bushes budded, and Trees did chip, And Lambs by Suns approach did skip; When Mires grew hard, like tosted Bread, That men might through the Carses ride: When folks drew blood of arms and legs, When Geese and Turkies hatched Eggs: When poor folks Pots were fill'd with Netles, When Fish did domineer in Ketles; VVhen Lent did sore annoy the Glutton, VVhen Sun left Fish to lodge with Mutton: VVhen night and day were of like length, Of March the eighth, or twelfth, or tenth: When several Criticks, great and small, By mending Lines, did marr them all. When Transcribers preposterous speed Made them like Pictures spoil'd with Threed On Arras Hangings back-side, when The lowr'd mistakings of some men Made several great Wits of the Land Blame what they did not understand; And some to hunt a Flea contrive; The Squire near London did arrive: To meet him old and young came forth, As Rome did once to see Jugurth. They knew each passage of his Journal, Both by report, and by Diurnal: We dread, they will him sore abuse, But let us first invock the Muse. Thou Muse, who never dost abandon Those who have scarce a Legg to stand on When they ascend Parnassus Mountain, Till in the end they taste a Fountain Which makes an Owl then them sing sweeter; Make me once more a fool in Meeter, That I may be of all admired, Confuting Presbytry, casheered; Which I of late so much adored, But now, when I get nothing for it, Make me, O Muse! to change my Note, Declare against it, turn my Coat: Compesce me, Muse, these stout Bravado's Of these stiff-necked Reformado's, Who still maintain, unto this day, They have th' Office, though they want Pay; In others Harvest putting their Sickles, Troubling the Land with Conventicles; Whose stubborn hearts cannot be turned By the Dialogues of Gilbert Burnet. Prove, Muse, that Synod-men, Church-Wardens Are Bears, and Synods are Bear-Gardens: For both have tongues, and teeth, and nails, But, Muse, what wilt thou do for tails? But that's all one, the matter's small, For true Bears have no tails at all: And so the simile still jumps, In stead of tails thou'lt find there rumps. When thou shews how the Squire disputed, And Ralph the Sectary confuted, That he of wits almost bereft him; But to the Squire now where we left him. He melted all in tears for pity, Seeing the ruins of the City: But when he saw in other places Houses arise with goodly faces, And Turrets mounting up, and soaring, And the Air's middle Region boaring; So PhÅnix, when it's burnt in Spices, Up starts another from its ashes. Cry'd out the Squire, Rome once was burn'd By French, then Worlds Mistriss turn'd, God may the same to London grant, If it renew the Covenant. While this he spoke, his Horse he lights off, And with his Handkerchief he dights off Tears from his eyes, then on the ground He grovelling lyes meditabound, His Horses grievous succussation Had so excoriat his Foundation, That till the Hide his Hips did come on, The earth he could not set his Bum on. Then after sad Ejaculations, He vents these following Meditations. Wallace, quoth he, having adoe, Still eat the quarter of a Cow, And to the boot, ere Cloaths were put on, He would sometimes dispatch a Mutton: For when he wanted morning fare, He was like Sampson without hair. A Priest, whose Teeth did Head and Legs swell Did still eat Powder'd Beef and Eggs twell Before he Preach'd, else he half dumb sings, Like to a Fiddle wanting some Strings. Hence, by experience I gather, He is a liar, though my Father, Who thinks, a man can do or speak well, Who doth neglect his fast to break well. I am ingag'd in a Transaction, Quoth he, requiring Tongue and Action, That to my Tackling I may fast stick, Though I should lose my Ears like Bastwick: Though they should ty me Heel and Neck fast, It's requisite I take my Break-fast. This said, his Budget he unlooseth, And all the wealth within discloseth; VVhich for variety did scorn. The wealthy Amelthea's Horn; Or the rich Abbey of St. Lawrence, Or Cabine of the Duke of Florence, Ju'st like the Pocks of Graham and Guthry, It was his Vestry and his Buttery: His Lardner and his Bibliotheck, There lyes of Oat-meal neer a Peck, With Waters help which Girdles hot Bakes, And turns to Bannocks, and to Oat Cakes. There a piece Beef, there a piece Cheese lyes, And there an old Night-Cap of Freez lyes, His head attire, when he the house keeps, On which now here and there a Louse creeps. Here lyes a pair of Shoes ne're put on, And there lyes a Poor Man of Mutton. There lyes half dozen elnes of Pig-tail, There his Panash, a Capons big-tail, With white in middle, shining Star-like, And there be Onion-heads and Garlick, The food of Turkish Janizaries, There Turpentine and Larie Berries: His Medicine for passage sweer, That for the Van, these for the Reer; And there a piece of Poudered Fish lyes; And there some Butter in a Dish lyes; There Turnips thirty inch about lyes, And there some Pepper in a Clout lyes, There Fingram Stockins spun on Rocks lyes, And there his Sneezing Milne and Box lyes: There lyes his Elson and his Lingle, Which double-sold Shoes makes of single, With help of old pieces of Leather; There lyes some Wool that he did gather, Left by the Sheep, as certain pledges, They were entangled in the Hedges: There Clouts and Papers little Mugs stops, As in Apothecaries Drug-shops, With Vinegar and Oyl for Sallads; And there lys Books, and here lyes Ballads, As Davie Lindsay, and Gray-Steel, Squire Meldrum, Bewis, and Adam Bell, There Bruce and Wallace, fierce-like Mars Knight: There lyes Dialogues which his Arse dights There Last-goodnight, and Chevie Chace, With Gendarms in the Frontispiece, Which makes more weep, when they read on it, Thou Curats Sermons, fie upon it! And there lyes Bands, Shirts, and Cravats, There two three Skins of Lambs and Rabbets, For to commence a London Trade, And this was all the Wealth he had. But pardon me, I had forgot, There was some other thing I wot; I think it Powder was, and Leed To shoot the Bishop through the head. He takes a Bible with Covering worn off, And ending and beginning torn off: He reads, and then he says the Grace, Then to his Victuals falls apace. When first bitt scarce down throat was sliding, Within a days march of the midding, Then he a multitude espies Approaching him with shouts and cries, He leaves his victuals, falls a-gazing, Just like a Tupp when he's a grazing, When folks comes by, he slights his food, Stares in their face and chews his Cude. He thought these fools came out to meet him, That first they might salute and greet him, That afterwards they might him bring With greater pomp unto the King. Such honour at their entry-hours Are due unto Embassadours. Both dust and sweat from face he rubs off, A Looking-glass he makes the Dubs of: He trims his Beard, and then his Head too, Rights Basket-hilt on Shoulder-blade too: His hands he washes, pairs his nails, Takes his Panash of Capons tails, Which he pines on before his Hat; He put about a clean Cravat, And then upon his hands he streeches Two yellow Gloves, with green Silk steeches; Leaps to his Horse, and on he went, To take and give the Complement: While hips excoreat, made him swadle Through all the corners of the Sadle. When he the multitude approaches, His eyes he fixt first on the Coaches, Ranged like Wild-geese in a line; Then cry'd he out, no friend of mine If I can hinder those, shall enter. 'Tis wonder people so should venture, To break their arms, and legs, and heads, And to disjoynt their shoulder blades: Ladies to have their naked Breeches Both view'd and Lanced by the Leeches; Which made some Husbands forth a Tuck hold, Swearing the Rogue would make them Cuckold Those made a Lady of our Land Upon her neck and shoulders stand With a third of half dozen Thighs, Naked erected to the Skies; And ere that posture she was got off, Many did see the thing ye wot of; Which when they told her, readily She answered, she wondred why They did not kiss't, and take their leave on't, It was the last fight they should have on't: She vow'd thereafter, well I wot, VVith her Grand-dame to walk a-foot VVhen Coach-men drinks, &amp; Horses stumble, It's hard to miss a Barla-fumble. Then did he seriously begin VVell to consider those within: He soon perceived by their postures They were no Nuns brought up in Cloysters, To show their Legs, some truss their Laps, Some throw off Scarffs to show their Paps, Some Masked were, the Sun to keep out, Which lifting, now and then, they peep out. Widows from Vails set out their Noses, As Snails do from their Shelly Houses; As they would say unto the Gallants, Come, Gentlemen, behold our Talents: Come nearer, that we may espy you, If ye be ought worth, we will buy you: Where, ten to one, some get a fortune, As one did with my Lady Nortoun. Among the rest he did espy ones, Whom he conceived to be Hee-ones: Those he believed were his Mates, Embassadours of Kings and States, To do him honour at his entry, With the Nobility and Gentry: He cry'd to them to keep the peace, And not to wrangle for the place, For all of them remembred well Of that Bowtad of Bateveile, VVhich cost the lives of brave Commanders, And well nigh lost his Master Flanders. He bids them all take place by Lots, No King had place, but he, of Scots, VVhose Royal Ancestors, it's clear Has kept one Race two thousand year; VVhose Successors as yet escaped The tricks of Pipin, and Hugh Capet. Others are not of that condition, They'r Kings but of a late Edition: Though some be small, and others greater, Yet who go first, or last, no matter; For all their Gold, Spices, and VVines, They come from interrupted Lines. Being inform'd of his mistake, It was to Ladies that he spake. VVhat Devil they are? reply'd the Squire, They'r men in Garb, and in Attire, They've Vests, they've Swords, they've Piriwigs They tread the measure of the Giggs, Just like the men, their Buttocks vaper, They cast their Gammonds up, and Caper; They Cajole Ladies at the Balls too, And standing piss against the VValls too: They're Spurr'd &amp; Booted when they ride too, And gallop, when they Hunt, astride too, VVith Swords and Pistols they fight hard too, Some have appearance of a Beard too: And, which of all's the greatest wonder, They ly above, their Gallants under. Me's Dames, quoth he, that we may ken VVhether ye women be, or men, It's fit ye open keep before About a Trencher breadth, or more. Ye're Monsters, if that do not measure The Circuits of your Holes of pleasure. VVhile he was giving this advice, They all surround him in a trice, All wondring at his Equipage: Some ask'd his Horses price, and age: If there came sympathetick speed From Riders heel, or heel of Steed; If there came an inchanting force To Masters Purse, from Skin of Horse; Some, why no Spurrs, his sides to claw, And for Boots, several Ropes of Straw: Why Sodds for Sadle, and Branks for Bridle, And Plaids for Scarff about his middle. Some asked his Panashes price, If't was a Bird of Paradice. Some ask'd if Basket-Hilt and Dudgeon Had ever set a work Chirurgeon, Some Jeer'd the long Crown of his Hat, Some at his Gloves, some his Cravat, Asking more Questions at once Then would have puzled John of Dunce, Or Bonaventure, or Soncinas, Or Biel Ockam, or Aquinas. When Sinan Bassa Charg'd a Hill, To try his Military skill; Though many a grievous wound it got By Cannon, and by Musquet shot, The Hill did neither bow nor bend, Although he charg'd it thrice on end, But still abode him face to face, Chusing to die upon the place, Rather then turn its back and yield; Just so the Squire did keep the Field; And bravely did receive their Tongue-shot, Just as the Hill did Sinan's Gun-shot: He stood as senseless as a Stock is, Or among raging Waves, a Rock is, When furiously they knock its Crown, To make it break, or make it drown. At last, he said, with sober grace, When ye grow hoarse ye'll hold your peace. Then fair and softly on he tripped, For, like a Spaniard when he's whipped, He thought it was a great disgrace For to accelerat his pace. When they him saw so little troubled, Then they their Questions redoubled; Some ask'd his errand, and his name, And from what Potentat he came, From Turk, or Sophee, or Mogull, Who wear much Linnen on their Skull, Or from either Tartarian Cham, Who of their Horse Hips make a Ham, Or from Pegu, or from Chine, Or from the Emperour Abyffine, Or from the Muscovite, or Poll, Or Dane, whose chiefest wealth is Toll, Or from the Emperor, or the Swede, Or Hogen Mogen Brother-hood; From the Savoyard, or the Swisse, Who Apples seeths with roosted Geese: From Florentine, or Protugnese, Or from Morocco, or from Fess; Or if he came from Spain or France, Or from some Indian Weerowance, To barter Gold and Beaver Skins For Glasses, Beads, and Knives and Pins; Or from the Presbyterian Scots, Who never yet had turn'd their Coats. Did he a Supplication bring To put ill counsel from the King; And that his Majesty would grant Renewing of the Covenant: And had Commission for to tell him, If he refus'd, they would compel him. When thus they pressed him so fast, Patience turn'd fury at the last: These last words did him so inrage, He fac'd about and gave a Charge; Then with his Tongue out, thus he stutters, With face awry, like old Cheese Cutters. You cursed Antichristian Rable, Ye Mungrels of the Whore of Babel, Ye Sectaries, and Covenant-breakers, Half Cukold, and half Cuckold-makers, For all your flouting, and your tanting, When we went first a-Covenanting, Ye did us court, ye did us bribe, Invited us, like Juda's Tribe, To purge your ten Tribes of Israel From Jeroboams Calf, and Baal: Your money mov'd our Concience To arm our selves in your defence. When your intentions you had got, And by our means, had under foot Trode all your foes, and them defeated, At last, we found we were but cheated. Your quarrel was, pretended bondage, By reason of Tunage and of Poundage, To get Militia by Law, To keep his Majesty in aw: To free your selves when money waxes From Inquisitions and Taxes: Your only end was self enriching, Your sole Religion was your Kitching. You valued Puddings sodd in Pocks More then Religion Orthodox: Whereas we witness God and Angels, Prophets, Apostles, and Evangels, For trash, or any earthly thing, We never did oppose the King: Yea, all of us, both great and small Will quit him Lives, and Lands, and all So he give way to purge the Temple, As pleaseth Mr. Gabriel Semple. He spoke so thick, he paus'd a little, And having cleans'd his Beard from spittle, Like Tindale at the Stake, he cryes Lord, open the King of Englands eyes, And then his Majesty will grant Renewing of the Covenant. Thus did he perorat his fliting, As at Tarantums Spiders biting, They were affected thereanent, According to their Temperament. Sanguinians did only laff, Cholerick Melancholians chaff. Some bade hang him, some bade stone him, And some did Mastives hunt upon him. Some Daple under Tail did prick, And made him bounce, and leap, and kick: Some aim'd to tare his Straw Gramashes, Some cries, have at Beard and Mustaches: Some grasped him about the middle, Till Bumm did sound like Gambo Fiddle: Some would have Breeches down to whip him, Some with their Nails would tare &amp; nip him; Some with Briars &amp; Thorns would scratch him: One fearing that they would dispatch him, Who was a man more moderat, He made a Court'sie with his Hat, And begged leave to plead his Cause According to the Nations Laws. Contending with a foolish tongue, Quoth he, is but a War with dung: Though in the strife ye prove victorious, Dirt makes your finger-ends inglorious, As lately happen'd unto one Who needs would quarrel Sanderson, And prove he was a lying knave, Of which, what credit could he have; When he had done, he prov'd no more, Then all the world knew before. To take such pains, imports as much As any doubted he were such. Refuting such as he, with words, Is like Canarie washing Turds: The Wine in taste and hue grows meaner, But Turds grow ne're a whit the cleaner. This simile, though somewhat rude, Yet so appeas'd the multitude, That by degrees their clamour fell, Like sound of Lute-string, or of Bell, When Thumb or Hammer of a Clock Gives the Epilogizing stroak. And in the end these furious Cryers Stood silent like observant Friars, Or like to Dumbies making Signs, Or like to Fidles wanting Strings, Or like to Salmons, or to Codds, Or Turks, when they took in the Rhodes. Then piece and piece they dropt away, As ripe Plumbs in a rainy day; Till in the end, they all were gone, And left him standing all alone. Likeas, we do observe and see In those who are condemn'd to die, That they are sore annoy'd and troubled, At first, when they cast off their Doublet, Truss up their hair, their eyes blind-fold, That they may not grim Death behold: Thinking their neck the stroak is hard on, If any tell them of a Pardon, Although their heart be lighted somewhat, Yet fear and hope fight still a Combat, Till that they hear the Air to ring With Clamours of, God save the King: Then hope triumphs, and fear doth vanish, Like grief, when it's expell'd by Spanish, Just so the Squire, when all at once They him opprest with Fists and Stones, A gelide fear his heart possessed, His final hour approach't he guessed: Trembling he stood, in a Quandarie, And purg'd, as he had eaten Larie: As was confirmed by the speeches Of those who after washt his Breeches When he perceived the retreat, That flight, quoth he, is but a cheat Like that of Greeks, for to destroy An ancient City, called Troy, By help of that Tree Horse of Pallas: It is some stratagem of Wallace, Who in a Pig-mans Weed, at Bigger, Espied all the English Leagure. But when he found by certain trial, The retreat was not forg'd, but real, Then did he resolution show, And like a Cock began to crow. One man, quoth he, oft-times hath stood, And put to flight a multitude, Like Sampson, Wallace, and Sir Bewis, And Finmacoul beside the Lews, Who in a Bucking time of year Did rout and chase a Herd of Deer, Till he behind, and they before, Did run a hundred Miles and more, Which questionless prejudg'd his Toes, For Red-shanks then did wear no Shoes; For to this day they wear but Calf ones, Or, if of older Leather, half ones. He chased them so furiouslie, That they were forc'd to take the Sea, And swam from Cowel into Arran, In which Soil, though it be but barren, As learned Antiquaries say, Their Off-spring lives unto this day. But pardon me for such digressions, For, were it not for such expressions Which from the Muses we extort, Our Poems would be very short. Then did the Squire obtest, and pray, And them conjur'd that they would stay, For he had quarrel against none But Ralph the Squire, and Sanderson, Which two, as every body knows, Are Presbyterians mortal foes: Th' one calls them Bears by Allegory, That other Fellow wrot a Story, In which he doth them scandalize so, That all the Devils blush, he lies so; Thinking it would be liked well, He sent a Copy into Hell, To be perus'd in a Committe, Then said a Devil which was wittie, It serves for nothing, tell the fool, But to be Napkins at the Stool, When men exonerat their Tripes, Or lighting of Tobacco Pipes; For Hells affairs are ne're atchiev'd By railing fools, of none believ'd: Hells fittest Agents, as all grants, Are those who are reputed Saints. And thus he made an end of praying. Then all began to think of staying, And one another did exhort For to return and see the sport; But Sanderson appeared not, Stout Ralph amated not a jot, Bravely and resolutely did fall up, First at the trot, then at the gallop; Just as the Huggonots, victorious At Coutrus, charg'd the Duke of Joyeus, And was upon him ere he wist, Menaceing him with Tongue and Fist, With all the Rable in his Rear, Who followed him to see and hear. The Squire, who only spoke in jest, Seeing what he expected least; He thought they verily were gone, And that the storm was over blown, Surprized with the sudden danger Of Ralph, in such a furious anger, Whom he thought did already spurn him, He knew not to what hand to turn him; At last, his tongue and teeth commences To vent Adages and Sentences. It is a saying wise and old, Quoth he, to make a Bridge of Gold To fleeing enemies, it's best To let a sleeping Mastive rest, Lest he, awaken'd with our knockings, Tare all our Breeches and our Stockings, And to the boot, our Shin-bones hole up, And from our Buttocks take a Collop: And with his furious teeth our throats cut, Down which we watered Meal of Oats put; Which we prefer, with Loch-Broom Herring, To all the King of Babel's fareing. A foolish tongue, without remead, Brings mischief on the owners head; It is a pestilentious Clout, Causing contagion all about; It raiseth jealousies and fears, Yokes Kings and Subjects by the ears. What was it else, but tittle tattle, That brought our Brethren out to Battle? What stops them more from turning Loyal, Then tongues of some, esteemed Royal? With which they persecute those poor souls, As setting Dogs do Pouts and Muirfowls; At last, within their Netts ensnared, And from all hope of pardon barred, They force those poor men, under hand, Still to rebel, to get their Land. My tongue will bring me to that pass, Quoth he, to which was Hudibras, Who, when with honour he had got off, In the adventure that ye wot off, He not content, but seeking more, Los'd all that he had gain'd before; And was brought to a prison Tragick, In Wooden Castle, made by Magick; Where he too late laments his mishapes, As Ladies, when they do not Misclaps From Gallants, of their own procuring, From Husbands, when they go a-whoring. Having dispatch'd this Phrygian wisdom, Like Malefactor getting his doom, He strained what he could, to shew A tres bon mein en mau vais Jeu. He out with Basket-hilt and Dudgeon, (While from his eyes came a deludge on, As from the eyes of Children whipped, Or sore Horse-eyes, with Vitriol nipped,) Stands at his posture, Fencer-like, And was within an Ace to strike; Yet on the sudden, doth advise. To take a course by far more wise. Wise men, quoth he, as all men knows, Try all things first, ere they try blows. When Rome to Conquer, all was hasting, Peace was the first, War was the last thing They did practise to subdue Nations, VVho loved not such Innovations. If I the truth of Story miss not, This is the Cardo of the Dispute. And if my reasons do no good, I'le dye their Breeches with their Blood: But this within himself he mutters, And then these words to Ralph he utters. VVhat means this furious hurly burly? Friend Ralph, quoth he, I tell thee surely, I am no private man; believe, I am a Representative: To force me to Degladiations, Is contrare to the Law of Nations: Though thou me should bang back and side, I could it (Honour safe) abide. Brave Mansfield, challeng'd by Baumaris, Refused once to fight at Paris; Because he did Negotiat VVith Publick Trust Affairs of State. The Spanish Agent Don Henriques, Put up a great affront of Criques, VVho once at Rome, his pride to danton, His Nose saluted with a Panton. Dost thou esteem me such a Coward, To be afraid of one as thou art? Thy threatnings are like Childrens Squibs, Though they singe Cloaths, they break no Ribs VVere it not that my Sword is rusted, VVere it not that I am entrusted VVith things of such a high concernment, As Presbyterian Church-Government; For all thy frownings and thy cloudings, I would send Sun-shine through thy Puddings. I do thee as a friend advise, ('Tis better soon then late be wise) That thou would let alone this Sword-fight. And graple with me in a Word-fight; Let's try who others best can Confute, This is the Cardo of the Dispute, If Synod-members, and Church-wardens Be Bears, and Synods be Bear-Gardens. Thou dost affirm, I do deny, Prov't if thou can, I thee defy. One might have known by Ralpho's face, He lov'd not VVar so well as Peace; He only counterfeited courage, His wrath, teeth-forward, was not true rage. Yet he his passion so dissembled, That Squire at first both shak'd and trembled; But when he heard the Squire speak big words That in his Belly he would dig Swords, He looked then as if his Nose bled, And such a Flea within his Hose had, That in his mind was great confusion, Till he considered the conclusion; Where Peace was offered, and the War gone, He gave God thanks, like Praise God Bairbon, A good heart to himself he took then, And these same very words he spoke then, Which once the great Turk Solymanus Spoke to Vilerius Liladamus; Having him under, at such odds, That he was forc'd to quit the Rhodes. I'me glade to hear that now thy mind Is more to Peace then War inclin'd; Then adds he, fighting is a fool thing, What doth it else but sturt and dool bring. It's better Tongues decide the matter, Then other Noddles pelt and batter. Now others beck, now others Dock hit, As feathred Fencers do in Cock-pit; Who fights but in their own defences, Let them be Kings, let them be Princes, By Law and Reason I them can bind, That they are enemies to mankind; As witnesseth Sir Thomas Kellie, And Grotius de Jure Belli. What are such Warriours but oppressors; And many times we see aggressors, Who trouble other mens reposes, Gain nothing else but bloody Noses: Who quarrels pick with Neighbour Nations, Get Halberts thrust through their Fundations, As we may read in many a Book Of Charles that Burgndian Duke. Poor High-way-men, with tattred hose, are Not Robbers half so great, as those are, Who Diadems wear on their head, And make so many living dead; And so much Christian blood mispends; Either for French or Spanish ends: These first, poor Rogues, will pick a Pocket, And break a Door up when it's locket; And on the High-way will a Purse take, When cold and hunger makes their Guts ake. Those latter, with their Armies Legions, Robes Kingdoms, Castles, Towns and Regions: As said two ten Tuns Ships Commander To Macedonian Alexauder. But now, let us come to the question, The which was raised the Contest on, Since thou so hard dost put me to it, I'le let thee see that I can do it: And have both will and wit to reckon, And beat thee at thy own tongue-weapon. Better perhaps, then thou believes, I'le prove these two affirmatives: That Synod-menbers, and Church-wardens Are Bears, and Synods are Bear-gardens. Thus said, his fingers he dispatches Unto his head, and winking scratches, First from the Van, unto the Reer, And then athwart, from ear to ear; While like sagacious Hound, he traces, And windeth all the Topick places: Till in the end prepared, Satis, He disputes thus a Comparatis. And first, quoth he, it's clear to all, They have the same original: For twenty Shillings to a Bodle, Both are the birth of humane nodle. Both are in that degree of kin, As other brethren uterine. Its certain, there is never a word Of either, in Scripture, on record: And without question and all doubt, Thus Bear-baiting may be made out By holy writ, as lawful as is, That Chain of Presbyrerian Classis. This for their birth; now for their nature, If with deliberation mature The case we ponder, beasts of prey And rapine, as are Bears are they Who do establish Gospel order By Rapine, Sacriledge, and Murder. What are their Orders, Constitutions, Church-censures, Curses, Absolutions? But several mystick Chains they make, To ty poor Christians to the Stake: And then set Heathen Officers, Instead of Dogs, about their ears. What else are Synods, but Bear-gardens, Where Elders, Deputies, Church-wardens, And other members of the Court Manage the Babylonish sport: For Prolocutor, Scribe, and Bear-ward, Do differ only in a meer word: Both are but several Synagogues Of Carnal men, and Bears, and Dogs: Both Antichristian Assemblies, To mischief bent, as far's in them lyes: Both sttave and tail with fierce contests, The one with men, the other Beasts: The difference is, the one fights with The tongue, the other with the teeth: And that they bait but Bears in this, In th' others Souls and Consciences. This to the Prophet did appear Who in a Vision saw a Bear Prefiguring the beastly rage Of Church-rule, in this latter age; Where every Hamlet is govern'd By's Holiness, the Churches head: More haughty, and severe in's place, Then Hildebrand, or Boniface. Such Church, must surely be a Monster With maney heads, for if we Conster What in th' Apocalyps we find, According to th' Apostles mind; Ti's, that the Whoore of Babylon, With many heads, did ride upon. The Pastors who do rule this Kirk, What are they, but the handy-work Of mens Mechanick Paws, instilling Divinity in them, by feeling. From whence they start up chosen Vessels, As folks, by touching, get the Meazles. So Cardinals, they say, do grope At th' other end, the new made Pope. Bell and the Dragon's Chaiplans, were More moderat then them, by far: For they, poor Knaves, were glade to cheat, To get their Wives and Children meat; But these will not be fob'd off so, They must have wealth and power too; Or else they'l make their party good, By making Nations swim in blood. And thus I reasoned the Case, Once with my Master Hudibras. All that I said was too prolix, Here to repeat, I only fix Upon the Morrow, with a few words, What thou has said's not worth two Cow Turds Reply'd the Squire, and then he smites Fore-head with Fist, to rouse his wits; Which straight did take th' alarm so hot, That down to Tongue and Teeth they got: From whence, thus worded out, they flie, Like Bullets from Artilerie. Ye Sectaries, quoth he, have bee-heads, Thy prats, a Cerberus, with three-heads: Neither of which barks any bon-sence, But railing, blasphemy, and non-sence: Thou'rt ignorant in Logicks Art, As I will show thee ere we part. But to the point, now I will close, And reason ???????????. And first, I say, for my defence, Thy argument wants Consequence: Though things agree to both together, It follows not the one's the other. Affirmatives, in second figure, Nothing conclude in Logicks Ligure, Which any constant man believes, So we may prove Financiers Thieves, Camelions Beef and Cabbage eaters, And Lawyers, and Physicians, cheaters. That Horse are Men, and Owls are Ounces, That Privie Counsellers are Dunces: That Chamber-pots are Looking Glasses, And Senators of Justice Asses: That Colledges, and Muses Cavernes Are Bawdie-houses turn'd, and Taverns: That Stews are places of Contrition, And Pulpits, Trumpets of Sedition: And Merlines Prophesies Evangels, And Dees Spirits holy Angels: That all new Scurvies are the Pox, That Quakers Books are Orthodox: That rosted Wildcat is fed Lam, That Gresham Colledge is a Bedlam: Most of our first Reformers bad-men, And all the House of Commons mad-men: That Tallow Cakes are Ambergreese, That Sun and Moon are Cheshire Cheese And Whiggs, as loyal in Opinions, As any of the Kings Dominions. This for thy form, now for thy matter, Thou rails one some, others to flatter: Thy Medium's seeming true, yet false are, As Turnips growing in the Paltzar; Or any other fertile ground, Hollow with Worms, though skin be sound: Like Aples in the Lake of Sodom, Like beauties clapped in the Bodom: Like sour Drink in Silver Tankers: Like Golden Petticoats on Shankers: Like bald Heads with Periwiggs: Like sweet Powder on frisled Giggs, With aged Ladies now in fashion, When they would play beside the Cushion. But who reason in generals, Th' argument contentions and brauls, They bring but bout-gates, and golinzies, Like Dempster disputing with Meinzies. Men hardly can scratch others faces, When they are distant twenty paces: Il'e neerer come thy thrusts to Paree, Whereas thou dost Argumentaree, That Bear-baiting may be made out, Without all question and doubt, By holy Writ, as lawful as is, Lay-elder-Presbyterian Classis. Though few be clear, how doth the thing go? I answer unto thee distinguo: For if thou mean by Text express, Thou speak'st the truth, as all confess. This is our Orthodox Defence, Presbytries prov'd by Consequence. It is no Popish superstition, By consequential tradition To prove an Article of Faith, As learned Polyander saith. What have our Doctors else to say For PÃ¦dobaptism, or that day Which chang'd was, when the Church spoke Greek From last to first day of the Week. If thou were put to this distress, To prove Bishops by word express. Then Oyster-wives might lock their Fish up, Come to the Streets, and cry, No Bishop. Whereas thou dost affirm and say, Presbytry-men are Beasts of Prey, VVho do establish Gospel-order By Rapine, Sacriledge, and Murder: Thy reason hear both but and ben halts, It's not the causes, but the mens faults. Unto that Sore, I gave this Plaister, VVhen I did dispute with my Master: To blame a cause, for persons vices Is one of Satans main devices, VVherewith he very oft doth make VVell-meaning men the truth forsake. It's not superfluous and vain To tell a good Tale ov'r again. None can deny but these things fell out, But the true cause thou dost not smell out. Thy fallacy consists in this, Thou mak'st a cause where no cause is. Children are teached in the Schooles, VVho reason so, they are but fools. VVas never yet a Reformation Of Church, in any Age or Nation, But still the Devil, to make it vain, The outmost of his wits doth strain: He beats all Hell up with a Taber, To make Reformers lose their labour. VVhen first he sees he doth no good By persecution and blood, By seeming Sheep, and yet but Goats, By VVeeds appearing VVheat and Oats, By seeming Diamonds, yet but Glass, By seeming, Gold and yet but Brass, By Serpents in appearance Fish, By Silver Potles fill'd with Pish, By Saints without, and Fiends within, He strives the cause to undermine: As is recorded in the Pages Of Stories written in all Ages. VVhen Christ appeared, came a Theudas, And with Saint Peter, came a Judas; With Luther, Rotmans Knipperdolings, Who troubled Munster with their foolings. David Georges, Johns of Leyden, As is at large describ'd by Sleyden. When Calvin came, then came Socinians: When Perbins came, then came Arminians: With Hendersons, and Cants, and Trails, Came some, who whisked Ladies Tails. Who for such take us, are to blame, as One would revile St. Paul for Demas. And others also came, to wit, These Locusts of the th' Infernal Pit: Who seem'd at first all Covenant-takers, But straight turned Anabaptists, Quakers, Artemonits, Photinions, Servetians, Socinians, Manitheans, Novations, Scepticks, and Corpocrocians, Prochanits, Sabellians, Setheans, Circumcellians; Herodians, Herminians, Somonians, Armenians, Docitheans, Menandrians, Eunomeans, Cassandrians, Eutichians, Nestorians, And Doctor Hernry Morians; Noetians, and MartionitÃ¦, Gnosticks, and Anthropomorphit. Gortheans, and Calphurnitans, And Mr. Gilbert Burnetans; Meletians, and Arrians, And Antisabatarians; Helvidians, Cainians, Coluthians, Agrippinians; Some Chiliasts, and Lampetians, Some prove Melchizedecians, Cleobians, Florinians, And some prove Maximinians: Abelians, Thebusians, OphitÃ¦, and Pepusrans, Rhetorians, Quintilianists, Circoterists, Pristilianists, Eucratits, Hermogenians, Marians, and Origenians, Corintheans, and Alogians: Some half some whole Peligians, Some AntitactÃ¦, some Montences; AscitÃ¦ some, some Royatenses, Some Donatists, Volesians, Some Archonticks, some Ãtians. And some turn Theodotians; Tascodrongits, Nepotians, And some Disciples turn'd of Brown, VVho first infected every Town; Doritheans, and Fratricels, Some Neilorists, with Hood and Bells; Some Transilvanian TritheitÃ¦, VVho once made drunk with AquavitÃ¦: VVith Fists Alstedius did belabour, And tore the Beard of Bethlehem Gabor: Some Adamits, who as the speech is, Cast off their Petticoats and Breeches: Some other Hereticks more gross, Describ'd by Alexander Ross; For which, at present I want time, And though I had, I have not Rhime. That thy Bear-simile may jump, Those were our Tails, that was our Rump, VVhich from our Buttocks being broke off, Did all these horrid things you spoke of. But if thou still insist to rail, Saying, we did them with our Tail: That cavel's very quickly put off, 'Twas with our Tails, when they were cut off. If with my cut off Arms and Legs Thou Bishops Noddles Crush like Eggs; Not I, late owner of the same, But thou who strikes, must bear the blame. It's true indeed, at the beginning VVe smelled those things were a-spinning; But who leads Ladies through the streets, Expecting favour within Sheets, Coming to places, fy upon't, VVhere none but one can pass in front, So Barricado'd is the way, With emptied Privies, Mire and Clay: If they find no clean place to stand on, Yet ere their Mistriss they abandon, Through dung they march, like a bold Fellow, Till Shoes and Stockins grow Gold yellow. This is our case, if I have skill, Make the Apodosis who will, The sum is in our ends, we mean well, Though means we us'd, cannot sustain well. Whereas thou sayest, our Constitutions, Church-censures, Curses, Absolutions, Are several Mystick Chains we make, To ty poor Christians to the Stake, And then set Heathen Officers Instead of Dogs about their ears. At all thou dost not prove the question; The which was raised the Contest on. Madness within thy Brains hath far got, Proving them Bears, thou proves they are not. Whoever yet did see or hear, That Bears yoak't Dogs upon a Bear? As said thy Master, that brave man too, Who reason'd better then I can do, If Synod-Members, and Church-wardens Be no Bears, Synods no Bear-gardens Are, as to these is evident, Satis, Who reason can a Conjugatis. Thus worse then any man believes, Thou proves these two affirmatives: And after thou has Crackt so crouse, Thy Mountains do bring forth a Mouse. Whereas thou Presbytry dost Conster To be th' Apocalyptick Monster: Likewise to be this very Bear. Which to the Prophet did appear; Prefiguring the beastly rage Of Church rule in this latter age: Thou dost interpret Scriptures odly, That thou may'st rail upon the Godly: A Scripturest thou proves, as he was, In whose fool Bonnet-case a Bee was, Who needs would Presbytry have the Cabal Deciphered of the Whore of Babel, The Antichrist which Saints Blood spilled, And Enoch and Elias killed. He was so mad, he thought no shame Those very murdred Saints to name, It's sure either was distracted, Or on a Stage the Fool he acted. I'm confident and do believe, If these two brave men were alive, They would get Bedlam for their pains, Who hatch such glosses in their brains. It's lamentable, many deem None love the King, but who blaspheme, And still make holy Writ the Scale, on Which they take measures for to rail on. Presbytrie for the King more stout, as Those whom the very Children flout, as Champions, who though tongue-valiant, Yet meeting with a fierce assailant, Though with their tongue they take his part, Their actions are not with a fart. They may well drink his health in Taverns, And speak big words in Holes and Caverns, Devising Stories, Lies, and Fables; Call his most Loyal Subjects Rebels; But when they come to blows and knocks, They face about, and turn their Docks. Runs to their Pottle, which they mind most, Crying, the Devil take the hind-most. Where thou say'st, Preachers of our Kirk, And Pastors, are the handie-work Of mens mechanick paws, instilling Divinity in them by feeling: From whence they start up chosen Vessels, As men by touch get Itch and Meazels. I see not clearly what thou means here, I think thou blasphemy sustains here: This with our Church Monomachie Ends with a Gigantomathie. First, having fallen on her out-works, Or hedge, thy fancy round about works, Till in the end thou find occasion, Thinking she can make no evasion: Then thou with this blasphemous dart Thinks for to shoot her through the heart: Like Malefactor ty'd to Post, By railing on the Holy Ghost. The author of Manual Imposition, By Text express, and by Tradition, Thy own and others souls deluding, By such prophane similituding. No Porphyre, Julian, or Celsus, (As all the ancient Stories tells us) The Christian Faith blasphem'd, as thou doth, And others like thee, not a few doth: VVho bred, out of the peccant humors Of this our Church, like Wens and Tumors; Like Maggots bred within a sore, Would that which gave them life devour. Thou'lt say, these last four Lines were stollen. I answer with that Red-shank sullen, Once challenged, for stealling Beef. I stole then from another Thief. Now since thy Sophistrie's confuted, I end, to have my Lungs recruited. When Ralph intended to reply, His voice was drowned with a cry Of those, contending who the better Had, of the Champions, some the latter, Some the first, and some said neither, And some affirm'd, they knew not whether. There was, among the rest, a fellow Of swarthy hue, enclin'd to yellow; His hide enambled with itch was, He just splea-footed, like a Witch was: He was both broad and tall of person, With a long Sword behind his Arse on, Which he said was to serve the King; Some think he meant another thing: However he was such a person 'Twas thought among them all was scarce one Who better understood how things went, What Rumps and Presbytries disigns meant, And the Kings too, it's known he Had sometime served all the three. They all conjured then alone him, That he would take the speech upon him, And finally decide the matter, Who had the worst, who had the better: Which unto him would be but small pains, Who under all had made no small gains: At which requist the CacodÃ¦mon Upon him took to be Palemon. While Advocats of both the Parties With earnest and with piercing heart eyes Expect his doome, like Nero praying For justice to his Fidle playing. It's sport, quoth he, to be Spectators To such a pair of Gladiators: To see how they on other thump, He the Lay-elders, he the Rump, Others affront with such disgraces, And so throw dung on others faces. When thieves reekon, it's oft-times known That honest people get their own. By sad experience found it was, how That both these parties, pari passu Had ruine brought, and desolations On their own, and their neighbours Nations: When one the other had ov'rcome, And trode all under foot at home, Then they send out their wooden high-towers, To trouble the repose of Neighbours: And some times hither, some times thither, Set Europe by the ears together: That troubled with their mutual factions, They might not pry into their actions: Which were, as all the World doth ken, Abhorred both by God and men. Nought more secureth desperat matters, Then fishing doth in troubled waters. By such like policy and slight, They brought their power to such a hight, That Denmark, Holland, France, and Spain, And Sweden did strive with might and main, With humble and submissive speeches, To get the first kiss of their Breeches. They brought upon all such a terror, All seem'd to idolize their error, But thanks to God, and Albemarle, We now delivered are from peril. But none to thee, reply'd the Squire, (His breast so filled was with ire, That's eyes both sparkled and scintilled) Like Wolf, or Wild-cat, when it's killed. It's known thou didst what e're thou could, (But yet not so much as thou would) To make us still under that peril which was remov'd by Albemarle. To prospering King loyal to wonder, Still traitor to him when at under. VVhen thou, at playing with both hands, Has got Inheritance and Lands, Thou takes upon thee now to teach, And like a Fox, to Lambs doth Preach. That both of us did desolations And ruine bring upon the Nations, I answer, both did mischief bring, VVe by mistake, they by design: VVhen all is true thou say'st, yet that's but Like Monkeys Chesnuts, with a Cats foot Pulling from Ashes, or from Embers: Bathrons for grief of scoarched members, Doth fall a fussing, and meawing, While Monkeys are the Chesnuts Chewing: Yet more by policy then force, They made our Brethren, Foot and Horse To pull them Chesnuts from the fire, And wealth and power to them acquire: By which they did all Europ toss, While we got infamy and loss. Though I should teeth beat, like a Tabor, With tongue, I fear I lose my labour. We by experience do find, That a proud stubborn froward mind With prejudice intoxicated, Can hardly be indoctrinated: And yet my labour's not mispent, If any be indifferent, They'l find, as Sun doth shine in clear day, That we were only Rogues by hear-say, But fools indeed, which we will mend When we grow wiser, there's an end. But now I straight will to the King, Discharge the Message which I bring: Perhaps his Majesty will grant, If well informed, what we want. However, I hope he will not fail To hear till I tell out my tale. Though others foam, and fret, and chaff, I hope his Majestie will laff. Having this spoke, his Horse he switches, First on the Snowt, then on the Breeches; Who half a sleep, at last was got With much difficulty to trot. Yet some times paus'd he in the middle, Like Cadance keepers to a Fiddle; With rest alternative, and motion, The Squire rides on with great devotion, Till he came to his journeys end, H'alights, and doth not long attend, When some there came, who did him bring Straight to the presence of the King; Whom he espying, bow'd his knee, And said, if't please your Majestie. The sun indifferently on all shines, As well on low Shrubs, as on tall Pines: God hears the cry's of rich and poor: Wise Solomon, to right a Whore Resolv'd a doubt, to all mens wonder, Feigning to cleave the child asunder. Your Majesties wisdom inherent, And goodness, who are Gods Vicegerent, Will not disdain to hear complaints Of us, though but rejectaments. Ye'll hear me, Sir, defend our Cause, Though it be contrare to the Laws: That ye may solve that Gordian knot, If we be Rebells, and if not; If we be fools, wh'affirms we're neither, He is a liar, though my Father. I'le use no speech with Art besprinkled, Like Fairding on a face that's wrinkled: Without Rhetoricating fond shows, While I speak, Sir, as't in the ground grows, If ye a gracious ear afford, Shame fall me if I lie a word. Most men affirm, they do not see what We Non-Conformists now would be at: That we're more sundred in opinions, Then are the King of Spains Dominions: Then gazers on the late new Star were, Then the Commanders at Dunbar were. Then Lawyers and Physicians Counsels, Then Wives who Kail and Herbs in Town sells; Canvassing things in Church and State, When drink has set aloft our Pate. Where once w'agree, three times we squable, As doth a Bag-pipe's Base and Treble. One fears that which another hopes for, Like Cardinals, when they make Popes, or Like Heirs of Line, or Heirs of Tailzies, Or Gild, or Tradesmen making Bailzies. Now whether these be rants and flaws, Devis'd, Sir, to defame our Cause; Or whether there be something in it, Hear out my Tale, now I begin it: If I conjecture not amiss, The marrow of the matter's this. Some while ago, Sir, I was sent Your Majesty to complement, To beg some Preachers which we wanted, But ere I came, Sir, they were granted: When all expected thanks most hearty To you, from all the godly party; I was informed by a Letter, Were grown the Devil a whit the better. Our old blind zeal within us still bides, We haunt Conventicles on Hill-sides, Gives to our Preachers blows and knocks, For which we'r put in Irons and Stocks. I wondred what the matter meant, I thought, Sir, that the Devil was in't, At length I was inform'd of new, The fault was only of a few; Not of us all, and these we ken Have ever been John Thomsons men, That is still ruled by their Wives, Who carping at some Preachers lives, And reading their erroneous Books, Oppugning Doctrine Orthodox: Cry'd out, Prophanity and Atheism, Gross Popery and Arminianism Is brought upon us by the Prelats, With such expressions, those Shee-zealots Wrought so upon their Husbands fancy, That they from Fever fell to Frenzy, Threw at their Preachers Stones and Clods, As setters up of other Gods, As Baal, Beelzebub, and Dagon, The Apocalyptick Whore and Dragon. Though such proceedings be half treason, Yet to inform you there is reason: If any introduce the Schisme Of Popery, or Arminianisme. That Popes, Sir, are most dangerous things To Princes, Emperours, and Kings, They set their feet upon their neck, They make them, Sir, kneel down and beck, To hold their Sirrop when they ride, And run like Lackeys at their side: They make them bow down mouth and nose, To kiss, and smell, their sweaty toes: Makes them stand bare-foot at their Gates, And buy their peace at monstrous rates. They must have from them power all, Both spritual and temporal, Or they'l hunt men to cut their throats, And blow them up with Powder plots; As both your Grand-fathers can tell, Yea, they will curse their souls to hell, And give their Kingdoms to another, Who pays most to their Bastards Mother, It's long since for the Holy Ghost At Rome Olympias rul'd the Rost: Who think the practice far more sweeter Of Simon Magus, then Simon Peter. That I speak truth, Sir, within measure, Appears by Don' Olympias Treasure, The next Successor of St. Peter Thought he could take a course no fitter, Then part the Simoniack pelf, And take the one half to himself. Then said one, though a Conclave Brother, It went from one Thief to another. Strange! any Orthodox Divine Should doubt who is the Man of Sin? Which questionless they had not done, If they had read on Paul and John, Who paints him in their Prophesies, As they had seen him with their eyes. What e're Divine of your Dominions Vents to the world such opinions, Let them be Gold, let them be Glass, A Serpent lurks within the Grass. It's thought the Earl of Wiltshire's Spaniel Knew Antichrist, foretold by Daniel, And Paul and John, better then they Who study Scripture every day. When that the Pope held out his foot For to be kissed round about, Wond'ring to see the Carle so vain, He snatch'd it till he piss'd again. This much of those erroneous Books, Oppugning Doctrine Orthodox. Next, Sir, as for those Preachers lives, So much cry'd out on by our Wives, All the account that I can give on't Is, that my Minnie hath the lave on't. I wish them keep a sober diet, Or, if they drink, Sir, keep it quiet: If openly they haunt the Brewers, We'll not secure them from stone-throwers We cannot help it for our life, Sir, who can rule a Lawless Wife? To make a willful Wife her fits mend, Would put your self, Sir, to your wits end. Though they cause whip them through the Town. Though they them hang, though they them drown, Seing Priests drunk at third Bell ringing, They'l up with stones, and fall a flinging. And thus, Sir, I have shew'd you how The fault is only of a few, And not of all, and their defence Is, that they follow Conscience: If it be so, by Bishops leaves, They cannot well be called knaves: What e're they be, it may be said, Knaves never yet a Conscience had. And that a greater slander refels, If they be no knaves, they'r no rebels: I doubt any Logician can A rebel prove an honest man. What are they then? wee need n'advise, They'r poor folks, large as daft as wise. If they be such, and wish you well, As others of their actions tell, When in the English Troupers faces They you remembred in their Graces. That there may be a solid peace, Remove the cause, th' effect will cease. Take notice of those whimsey Books, Which in effect are heterodox. If once those Preachers mend their lives, There will be no Stone-throwing Wives. Forbid them scandalize the Leidges, By drinking healths to Ports and Bridges, To Whore of Babel, and to Giggs, And to preveen complaints of Whiggs, To scratch their skin, cut Caps and Cloaths, And swear 'twas Whiggs, with monstrous oaths But see misfortune and mishap, For scratch of Skin, and cut of Cap Examined to strictest rigours, Had different Geometrick Figures. Though Cap was hither mov'd and thither, The wounds could ne're agree together. Such scandal makes the Gospel stink, Such Books and Priests remov'd, I think We'll keep the nine and twenty May-day, On Thursday, Saturnday, or Friday; On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Munday, Or any other day but Sunday. Yea, Sir, when ye have ought adoe, To hazard lives and fortunes too. We will be ready at your call, Else plague of God upon us all. Observing how they all espy'd him, Cheifly how all the Ladies ey'd him; Was none among them all so coy, Whom he had not made laugh for joy: Believing, of them all was scarce one That honoured not his parts and person. He ears begins to prick, and neigh too, Just like a Ston'd Horse in a Meadow: Yet curbing, as he could, his passion, Till he should better learn the fashion: He made a Congee, and got him down, To see the rar'ties of the Town. How he did visit Bedlam fool-men, And disputed with Gresham-School-men; Discoursing of their Pigs and Whistles, And strange experiments of Musscls, Of Resurections of Ratts, And of the Language us'd by Catts, When in the night they go a Cating, And fall a scolding and a prating: Of their blood borrowing and lending, And all the Ancients wisdom mending; Perhaps ye'll hear another time, When I want Money and get Rhime. I have no leasure for it now Let it suffice, to tell you how, That going home-wards near to High-gate, His Muse had on her such a gay foot, That seeing London flee his view, He stands, and bids it thus, Adieu. From hard Calamities of Wars, and ruines caus'd by fire, A noble work thou dost arise, like Phenix from it's Sire. How stately Buildings thee adorn. and Towers which smite the Sky, Whose Bells do, by their melody, Apollo's Harp out-vy. More famous, skilful Artisans, the world never had: Thy Merchands worth Nobilitates, the wealth he gets by Trade. Thy Bishops zeal and Pietie up through the Heavens do flee; Thy Magistrats, who thee govern, might Roman Consuls be. Immortal vertues eloquence, and deep insight of mind; Thy Muses, those of Pallas Town are not a jot behind. And as the Sun, unto the world communicats his light; So by thy Kings resplendant beams, brave Town, thou shines so bright. So Rome arose, after the Gaules had it destroy'd by flame. Till in the end, the worlds bounds and Romes, did prove the same. London, that path by the begun, if thou insist upon, Strange, if the Worlds Empire and thine in end prove not the same. But now, thy buildings flee my sight, thy Towres go out of view, I bid thee then, with weeping eyes, most generous Town, Adieu. FINIS.</field>
