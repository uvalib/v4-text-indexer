      <field name="fulltext">TO FIELD-MARSHAL LORD ROBERTS HIS BRAVE MEN FIGHTING AND FALLEN, AND HIS GALLANT FOES The Wounded Piper of Elands-Laagte You know the way the Gordons fought at Elands-laagte Hill, How they charged the blazing kopje, how they cheered; How the pipes were always skirling with a Gordon piper's will Till the laagers and the rifle-pits were cleared. There are lassies o'er the Border who are weeping sore to-day For the flowers of bonnie Scotland lost and dead; For the lads of our own Highlands on those highlands cast away By the foemen and their torrent-rain of lead. There is one brave Highland piper who is sad as sad can be, Just to think his pipes had played no victor's part; And this is what the piper of the Gordons told to me, When I found him after battle out of heart. âWell, you see, I had no business to be playing at the front; Little use in showing Doctor such an arm; âServe you right, man,â he would answerâhe is straight as he is blunt; âKeep your pipes behind the boulders out of harm.â âI hardly felt the bullet, tho' my pipes were drenched with blood; Was I going out of action like a girl? So I took a dead man's shirt and tore it strip-wise where I stood, Bound the wound up tight and finished out the skirl. âFinished out and played another, cocked the reeds and let them drone, Gave the bag a clip the tighter as I blew. The shall pay for it, and dearly shall they hear the time and tune; And with gallant Gordons round me, on I flew. âOh the rattle of the Maxim! Oh the live shells screaming o'er! Oh the cry, âWhat price Majuba!â Oh the shout! If I live to be a hundred I shall not forget the roar, As we stormed the ridge to turn the beggars out. âI played what Gordons love most, and my bag of wind was full, When, bayonets all aflame, the ridge we topped; And I thought I still was playing, then there came a moment's lull, And I listened and I heard the pipes had stopped. âTheyâmy brand-new Edinboro' pipes, with Gordon colours grand! And a hole right through my bag of Highland breath! If you never won a battle, sir, you scarce can understand, But I almost wish that ball had been my death. âIt's not the bullet thro' my arm that makes me sad to-dayâ With bone unbroke the wound will soon be right; I am down at heart for thinking that my pipes just ceased to play When the Boers at Elands-Laagte turned to flight. Note.âThe following extract is from a private letter written after the battle of Elands-Laagte: âI went round the Gordons' camp on the day following the battle, and I don't think I saw one man who did not bear some mark, either on his body or on his clothes, of the enemy's bullets. Some of them had their helmets riddled. The most pathetic of all the sights was a piper of the Gordons, who was sitting with a Boer's shirt tied round his arm, which was saturated with blood. He had been shot through the arm, and had bound up the wound himself. When I asked him to go and get the doctor to dress his wound, he simply replied that the doctor would only tell him he had no business to get wounded. He didn't seem to mind his wound a bit, but he wailed over his bagpipes, which were a new set just sent out from Edinburgh. He had got a bullet right through the bag, which rendered them useless.â After the Battle It was out in the rain and the wind and the groans I tended the wounded, foe and friend; I thought with myself that the very stones Of the grim veldt-side, If they could, would have cried, âDoctor, don't touch them; let death make an end!â And presently, propped by a boulder grey, A grey and grizzled old Boer I saw; His whole right hand had been blown away; But, quiet and calm, He was reading a Psalm From a blood-stained book of the ancient Law. âMake haste and help me,â the old Psalm ran, âDeliver me! haste to help me, Lord! Let those who seek my hurt to a man Be put to shame, That so Thy name Be great upon all who trust thy word.â âPoor am I, Lord: thou knowest how poor; This hand shall never hold sickle again; Lord, succour me!â groaned the grey-beard Boer; âTarry not! come To take me home! Lord, haste Thee, and help me out of this pain!â And there, as he prayed in the rain and the wind, To the grey old Boer from the Orange Free Stateâ The man who had fought for cattle and kind With his sons, and sons' Sons less than their guns, To free his land from the men of their hateâ There came, at his call to the God of the Psalm, The Helper of helpless after the fray; And his face grew pale with a wonderful calm, And the Psalm-book dropped, And the blood-jet stopped, And the pain and the sorrow had passed away. Note.âAfter one of the late battles in Natal, an old Boer was found badly wounded, propped up among some rough boulders upon a kopje side; his rifle was laid idly by him, and the old man appeared to be waiting for death, and was quietly reading his Bible. In a Camp Hospital, Elands-Laagte I am a man of Scottish blood! Commandeered for the fight; They tried on me their Kaffir tricks, They rained their curses, blows and kicks, And swore to shoot outright. But I was built of Scottish blood! That blood ran never thin. I cried, âMy brains may scattered be, But Paul shall get no help from me Against my kith and kin.â I am a man of Scottish blood! The cowards, ten to one, They bound meâI was forced to yieldâ They drove me to the battle-field, They lashed me to a gun. I am a man of Scottish blood! The Lancers chargedâI knelt And prayed beside that limber's wheel; May neither Boer nor Briton feel What agonies I felt! I am a man of Scottish blood! On, on the Lancers came. âMy God, have mercy, Thou art just!â Then something smote me to the dust:â The Lancers passed like flame. I am a man of Scottish blood! I woke from swoon and night, I found myself in doctor's hands, Head brokeâarms swoll'n and black from bands They bound who bade me fight. I am a man of Scottish blood! They cried, âWho did this deed?â âSome black-heart rogue,â I answeredââSchiel.â They muttered, âGod made man! the De'il Alone could sire such breed!â I am a man of Scottish blood! God heard my prayer that day:â There, on the pallet at my side, And wounded soreâthe wretch who tied My arms to the limberâlay. I am a man of Scottish blood! My tongue I had forgot; But like a Highland torrent strong, The Gaelic came to curse the wrong Done to a loyal Scot. I am a man of Scottish blood! Still hot it leaps within At memory of those words we spake In wrath at him who strove to make Me fight my kith and kin. Note.âAn officer now in England, who was badly hurt at Elands-Laagte, tells a strange story. When charging the position a Lancer struck at an object, apparently a man, hiding behind a gun-limber, and then passed on to bestow his attentions elsewhere. Subsequently the object was found to be indeed a man, a man borne upon the Boer strength, and not only a man, but a Scotchman. His skull had been cracked by the Lancer, but he still remained at his post by the limber, though unconscious of all that was taking place around him, for it was discovered that his wrists had been tied behind him with stout cord, and his arms had similarly been tightly secured to the limber. In due time, the officer who tells this story and the Scot who had been so maltreated found themselves in a hospital ward together. Another person in that ward was âColonelâ Schiel, who lay wounded and a prisoner, the Scot and the âColonelâ being side by side. When sufficiently recovered the Scot told his story to his wounded brethren of the ward. He had been âcommandeeredâ to serve with the Boers, but absolutely refused to do so; if he must fight, he would fight in company with his own flesh and blood, but never against them. Thus protesting, he was secured and passed on to the front; where, he said, âa blackguard called Schiel,â who was in command of the Boer guns, had him tied fast to the limber, and that was all he could remember. It was not likely that he could long remain uninformed upon the fact that âthe blackguard called Schielâ was his next neighbour; and then the pent-up flood-gates of his wrath were opened. . . . It was a happy moment for the unlucky Schiel when he left that hospital behind him The Trooper who carried the Colonel in The Maxim's rattle, the cannon's roar, Was loud as the sea on a winter's shore, When he, the Colonel we loved so well, Hit in the ankle stumbled and fell; But up he rose with none to aid And proudly he walked as he walked at parade, And he smiled âthe bone's whole tho' the ball went thro' And a wound for the Queen is an honour due.â So forward still to the kopje's crest Went the Colonel of Colonels, loved the best. Then a bullet cameâI can feel the thud As it smote him down, I can see the blood Ooze thro' the khakiâcan hear him say âFor Queen and country I needs must stay, But forward ever brave lads until The Boers are swept like chaff from the hill.â And there in the open, while all around The bullets sputtered and splashed the ground, The Colonel groaned in his mortal pain Chilled to the bone by the wind and rain. Then I a Trooperâno matter my name, My horse had been shotâalone I came Into that hell of fury and flame; And God be praised for the thought of the thing, For thoughts are swift when the bullets sing; A voice seemed to say, âTho' it's ten to one Against the chance of its being done, Trooper, the thing for you is to strive To bring in the Colonel, dead or alive.â So I faced the bullets that hailed around, And I lifted him tenderly up from the ground, Thank God! he was breathing, though faint from his wound; And heavily weightedâpainful and slow, Backward I came, full in face of the foe. And the bullets hissed, and the bullets stung, And suddenly one of my arms down hung; Yet I knew no pain, but forward prest, For I thought of the Colonel we loved the best. Then I felt in a moment the weight was as lead, And I knew I was bearing a man stone-dead; Shot, as I carried him home, thro' the head; Ah! never from Elands-Laagte's fray A nobler spirit went home that day. But a voice kept saying, âIt's ten to one You will win the shelter. Well done! well done! Trooper, the thing for you is to strive To bring in your Colonel, dead or alive.â So I stumbled on with the Colonel brave And brought him in safe to a soldier's grave. Note.âA trooper in the Imperial Light Horse, who is at present in Maritzburg on sick leave, stated that he saw Colonel Scott-Chisholm shot, and describes the incident as follows:â âWell on in the engagement at Elands-Laagte the Colonel, who had been running about fearlessly, directing the troops, was suddenly seen to drop, and on examination it was found that he had received a wound in the calf of the leg. The wound, however, did not appear to be very serious, for the Colonel rose to his feet and made to rejoin his company. He had only proceeded a short distance, however, when he was again shot, this time in the groin, and he sank to the ground. The fire around him was very heavy at the time, but, notwithstanding, a trooper, whose name, we believe, is Benson, rushed forward, and, after some little difficulty, succeeded in raising the Colonel and putting him across his shoulders. He then hurried as fast as he could towards a shelter, but on the way the Colonel was shot a third time, the bullet on this occasion entering his head and causing immediate death. The trooper was also wounded in his gallant and humane effort, and we understand he is now in the camp hospital at Maritzburg.ââTimes of Natal. How the Naval Guns came to Ladysmith âCome away to Ladysmith! comrades of the Powerful! Bring us your hearts and your guns to our aid!â 'Tween decks with work then for twenty was each hour full. Jack of the Powerful is Jack of every trade. Rig us wheels! sling the guns! lash the trucks and speed them well! Boers shall learn what British words lyddite shells can say! Steam ahead my beauties now! stoke your fires and feed them well! Ladysmith is calling us six hundred miles away! Off by night from Durban dock, telling it to no man, Thro' the cold and thro' the heat, eyes before, behind, Scanning bush and scrub and hill and gully for a foeman, Fearing every bridge was sawn, every culvert mined. So along for Britain's sake, merrily we thundered, Neared at last the mountain gates meant for barricade. Shall we find our passage barred, rails all up, we wondered, Shall we win to Ladysmith, be in time to aid? On we roared, full speed ahead, Boer to left and right of us; Over the Tugela, and by grim Hlangwane's hill. Ladysmith! Ah, how the folk all shouted at the sight of us âGunners of the Powerful, come with heart and will. We the last train in, all bridges broken at the back of us. Swift we laid our beauties, for the fight raged far and near, Hardly pushed, our gallants and the foe heard sudden crack of us. Out of heaven each good Four-Seven thunderedââJack is here.â Where âLong Tomâ from out the distance belched of doom his shower-full, Fell our gift of Lydditeâhe was silent for a space. All the people crowded round and praised the good ship Powerful. Blessed the guns and blessed the tars and thanked God for his grace. Note.âMr. Balfour, speaking at Ardwick on 8th January, 1900, said: âWas there ever anything done with greater promptness and heroism than the sending of the naval guns of H.M.S. Powerful to the relief of Ladysmith? Capetown is 600 miles away from Ladysmith. I am unable to say exactly the number of hours, but in an incredible space of time from the receipt of the telegram asking for guns, the Powerful was turned into a workshop, the guns were provided with suitable mountings, were unshipped, and entrained, and were on their adventurous journey.â Those guns arrived just in the nick of time; the train that carried them was the last train in. Their sudden appearance in the midst of the fight probably saved the day. The Leonids and Ladysmith November 14 When from the Lion rained those fiery spears, And with cloud-armour on the brave earth passed To meet the missiles Uranus once cast Back to the sun, my heart was full of fears; The cries of warrior hosts were in mine ears, I heard in far-off fields the roar and blast Of battle, saw fierce meteors flashing fast Upon a cloud-girt town that rang with cheers. But when I saw how quite unharmed the earth Thro' flight of burning spears and flaming balls Wheeled on, and went in triumph on her way, My heart revived, my hope again had birthâ For safe beneath those stern-beleaguered walls Methought Great Britain still unconquered lay. Death Aboard our Transports TO ALL WHO IT MAY CONCERN Surely, beyond the nethermost pit of hell Some darker, deeper halls of doom await The rogues, who did for gain this deed of hate! The slaves to Mammon's lust who dared to sell Death to the crews they catered forâso well! So smilingly! then sent them to their fate Poisoned by garbage, while their horses ate Mildew for hay, and sickened, starved, and fell. Oh, England! has the madness of the mart So demonised thy merchants? can our land Nurse such dark traitors, rear such serpent broodâ As stings unseen, numbs brotherhood at the heart, Slays honour, and unnerves the soldier's hand By sense of treacherous vile ingratitude? To Winston Churchill Estcourt, 15th November, 1899 Not yet the Blenheim seed Has failed us at our need, Still does the name of Churchill ring like gold, Whether at Omdurman A warrior in the van, Or, where the Estcourt ridges are uprolled, He, having just ungirt his sword, took pen To fight as brave for us home-staying men. There, when the armoured train Was wrecked, and fast as rain Boer bullets fell on our devoted band, Did not this swordless one Remember great deeds done, And, hero, call on heroes all to stand? Did he not clear the wreckage, rails relay, And speed the wounded on their homeward way? Yea, and with lion-heart Did he not backward start, Clutch rifle, turn again to face the foe, To fightâif need be, fallâ For country, Queen, and all That made him great those many years ago? Ah! Churchill, let the thanks of Britain be The balm and calm of your captivity. Note.âThe following letter has been forwarded to the General Manager of the Railways by Inspector Campbell, of the Natal Government Railways, writing on behalf of the railway employÃ©s who escaped with the armoured train:â âSir,âThe railway men who accompanied the armoured train this morning ask me to convey to you their admiration of the coolness and pluck displayed by Mr. Winston Churchill, the war correspondent who accompanied the train, and to whose efforts, backed up by those of the driver Wagner, is due the fact that the armoured engine and tender were brought successfully out after being hampered by the derailed trucks in front, and that it became possible to bring the wounded in here. The whole of our men are loud in their praises of Mr. Churchill, who, I regret to say, has been taken prisoner. I respectfully ask you to convey their admiration to a brave man.â (THROUGH LAFFAN'S AGENCY.) Estcourt, Wednesday, 8 p.m.âAll the survivors praise Mr. Churchill's conduct. When the wreckage was cleared the engine-driver, who was wounded in the head, began to retire, but Mr. Churchill called him to come back, saying, âA man is never hit twice.â The man brought back the engine, and Mr. Churchill then helped to carry the wounded to the tender and accompanied them back to Frere. There he jumped down with a rifle and ran towards the enemy. An Estcourt Hero Orderly-Sergeant W. Tod, When next I lie in a tightish place, With the enemy's bullets raining downâ Shot thro' the armâand blood on my face From the man whose brains to the winds are blown, With nothing to help but the love of God, I shall pray he will send to mend my case, A second Orderly-Sergeant Tod. For Orderly-Sergeant W. Tod, It was you who saw when the Captain fell; It was you who, in face of the fusilade, Gathered the boulders and placed them well, As fence from the bullets to lend him aid; You built up the stones, you packed the sod, And there by his side, to cheer him, laid Your own brave body's length, Sergeant Tod. A Hero of Belmont November 23rd, 1899 When Britain calls the roll, And every warrior soul Receives his meed for help to Fatherland, They will remember him Who till the stars grew dim Led straight for Belmont heights his light horse band, Milton, the Major, whom with praise we crown, By bravery's right, the King of the King's Own. Through dawn of that fierce day He cheered them to the fray, And when in ambush fall'n his men retired, Gave up his horse to bear A trooper from the snare, And calmly, though a hundred rifles fired, Walked, as a man walks whistling o'er the heath, From forth the zone of bullets winged with death. Milton! your name we know, Far other debts we owe To him who bore it in the days of yore; But in your deed there sings Music of noble thingsâ The music that shall Paradise restore; Sound of the poems only heroes make Who dare all death, for brotherhood's sweet sake. Note.âA telegram from the special correspondent of The Times, after describing the battle of Belmont, said:â âSpecial gallantry was displayed by Major Milton, King's Own York Light Infantry. At the close of the action the Mounted Infantry he was leading fell into an ambush and fled. He supplied a trooper, whose horse had been killed, with his own, then walked away under heavy fire.â A Gallant Midshipman Graspan, November 25, 1899 When once again in peace these mountains stand, When once again these rivers peaceful flow, In this wild place a sea-born flower shall grow, A flower that loved the salt wind and the sandâ The flower of daring. Crimson shall expand The heart-shaped petals, so that men shall know Its roots have kindred with the heart below That gave its crimson blood for Fatherland. For here, a midshipmite, young Huddart fellâ Fell wounded, rose, marched forward, fell again, Rose up and with his fellows clomb the hill; To death thrice smittenâscorning shot and shell, And heedless of the blood-drench and the pain So he might serve his Queen and country still. TO THE EDITOR OF THE STANDARD. Sir,âIt may interest your readers to have further confirmation as to how our gallant officers at the front are doing and dying. I beg, therefore, to enclose copy of a letter received by me from the Admiralty. A brother Naval officer also writes:ââAt the bottom of the hill he was hit in the arm, and half-way up he was shot in the leg, but still pressed on. On reaching the top of the kopje he was shot through the stomach, and fell, mortally wounded.â I am, Sir, your obedient servant, James Huddart. Eastbourne, January 2. (Copy.) Admiralty, Dec. 29, 1899. âSir,âI am commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to inform you that, in a letter dated 26th ult., Captain Marchant, R.M.L.I., who was left in command of the Naval Brigade with Lord Methuen's force after the action at Graspan, reported as follows:ââIt is with deep regret that I have to report the death of Midshipman Huddart, who behaved magnificently, and still advanced after he had been twice wounded, until he was finally struck down mortally wounded.â âI am, Sir, your obedient servant, (Sgd.) âEvan Macgregor.â Bible v. Bullet There are more bullets than man can make, In a single page of the printed Word: The God of battles with Truth can break Rifle and cannon and spear and sword. And tho' I was only an ignorant Boer, Fresh from the Veldt with my rifle at trail, I knew that the Vision of John was sure, And the Spirit of God, not might, would prevail. For a night or two back, over kraal and fold, The Stars of Heaven fell unto the earth: The clouds with thunder apart were rolled, And the hills were moved from the place of their birth. I thought, To thy servants, Lord, this is a sign, To show what shortly shall come to pass, When with stars and with thunder of battle line, We meet and the foemen fall like grass. For the kings and nobles of high degree, And the rich, and the captains and mighty men, Bondmen and free to the rocks shall flee And hide them each in the mountain den. Hark to the mountains and rocks they cry, âFall on us; hide us from Him on the Throne, For the day of the wrath of the God is nigh, And who shall be able to stand alone.â We met, and by thunder of clouds and war, That chapter six of the Book was proved; For all night long star fell upon star, And all day through the hills were moved. And after the battle I, watching afield, Chanced on a stranger. I sprung with a call, Forth for his taking, and bade him yield, But I felt God's Word was far better than ball. So I dropped my rifle and opened the Book, And I motioned him mark God's Word was sure There at the chapter six:âso took My wayâan ignorant Veldt-side Boer. Note.ââThe Hon. George Peel, who was present at the battle of Belmont, got into a warm corner, the bullets flying thickly around him, and as he was only a spectator, he prudently scrambled back to the rear of the fighting line. After resting, he started again for the purpose of exploring, when he found himself suddenly in the enemy's camp. An old Boer jumped up from behind a rock, and Mr. Peel prepared to sell his life dearly, when, instead of a bullet, the Boer offered him a Bible, open at Revelation, and then fled precipitately.ââ (Daily Telegraph), Cape Town Times, November 27, 1899. At the Grave of Major Scott Turner Kimberley, 29th November, 1899 Let the loud hills be speechless for a space, No rifle speak, no cannon thunder loud; A prince of manliness and soldier-grace Lies silent in his shroud! And this was he who, wounded in the fight, Laughed at the scratch, and careless of all pain Would hide his hurt and sorrow out of sight, And sally forth again. This was the man who loved us mourners well, For our sakes led the desperate venture out, Stormed battery after battery-mound, and fell Dead at the fourth redoubt. Let the six volleys echo o'er his grave! With wailing blast the bugle make replies! Others he saved, himself he would not save, And now in peace he lies. We mourn a hero perished in his pride; We cannot grudge the tireless warrior rest: He served his Queen unflinchingly, and died The death he loved the best. Sail Away âTantallonâ To the public-spirited promoters of the Portland War Hospital, who sailed on board the Tantallon Castle for the Cape, Saturday, December 9th. Every heart you call on, Each voice speeding sends, Sail away Tantallon With our gallant friends! Leave the cattle lowing, Underneath the hill, Leave the yew-trees growing Quaintly at your will. Leave the Hall of Levens, Leave the banks of Lune, This your work is Heaven's, Britain feels the boon. Knightly-hearted healer, Gentle-hearted dame, Modder and Tugela Soon shall know your name. We with sword and thunder And the cannon's breath, Tear the wounds asunder You will bind from death. You, for friend and foeman, Passionately plan Pity of a woman, Mercy of a man. You, while others thought it, Dared the thing to prove, Others dreamedâyou wrought it This your deed of love. Not a heart you call on Now would bid you stay, Sail away, Tantallon Safe to Table Bay. All our tongues confess you Lords in love's employ, Bentinck! Bagot! bless you! Come again with joy. The Black Watch Magersfontein, 11th December, 1899 It was the blackest watch we kept, And bitter was the rain, When, solid column, forth we stepped O'er Magersfontein plain. Our hopes and fancies forward went, What should the morrow be? And backward still our thoughts we sent To Britain over sea. Dream-faces haunted all the way, And through the darkness smiled The mother with her babe at play, The laughing elder child. We see them still! ah, how they weep, To think upon the slain; And we, we lie a murdered heap On Magersfontein plain. Carbineers to the Rescue Arundel, 11th December, 1899 Have you heard how our bold Carbineers To each other were truer than steel? When the bullets sing loud in your ears, To halt and to wheel, And to dash to the rescue, needs nerve Such as only a hero can feel. They were out reconnoitring a farm By the kopjes on Arundel height, When the sergeant gave sudden alarm, The Boers are in sight! And a hundred came galloping downâ Little chance had the seven but flight. Ross's steed chipped a boulder and fell, Collis turned, caught the riderless black, Helped remount, when more swift than I tell, The horse reeled to the crack Of a rifle; but dauntless to save The lieutenant went scurrying back. âHere's a stirrup, man, leap up behind!â He cried, as they sped on their way; But fate to their speed was unkind, For a rifle cried stay! And the horse that was bearing them both Stone-dead to a Boer bullet lay. Then Dodson rode back full in face Of the Boers, his lieutenant to aid, But his horse, doubly weighted, lost pace; Collis knew it and said, âI must try my own luck in this game,â Though more desperate never was played! Trooper Dunn turned his head, in a trice He had wheeled and to Collis he flew, âMount, sir, or we both pay one price To the fiends who pursue!â So Collis took crupper and sprang, And the horse to his burden went true. But the foemen gained hard on their track, Collis cried âSave yourself! see, I go, And right glad so alive you get back; Let the Carbineers know, If I die, I shall carry to Heaven Unpaid the large love that I owe.â And the Boers came on swift and more swift, Then Freeman, his blood on his rein, Rode backââNow, Lieutenant, a lift, My horse will take twain!â Collis answered, âNay! peril your life? Better one than that two should be slain.â Then the sergeant spurred on with sad face, For he left his lieutenant for dead, But the Boer bullets beat in the race, And with hands over head, As the horse reeled, his rider went downâ Brave soul from brave body had fled. Lieutenant from Arundel height, You who live to this day you can tell That the heroes who turned in their flight, And the hero who fell, Not alone helped each other that day, They helped all the brave world as well. Note.âThe Daily Telegraph published the following from its Special Correspondent:â Arundel, Tuesday, 8.35 p.m. I am able to record some conspicuous acts of heroism during a reconnaisance this morning by Lieutenant Collis, of the Carabineers, of the enemy's position. Lieutenant Collis was in command of a patrol of six men. After examining a farmhouse where they were told by the farmer that no Boers were near, the little force proceeded to reconnoitre the farmside, from which a line of kopjes ran up to the enemy's position. They had got within 800 yards of the latter when Boers on horseback were observed coming down. As the patrol moved away Private Ross's horse fell. Though the Boers were now within 300 yards, Lieutenant Collis and Sergeant Freeman galloped back to give him assistance. No sooner had Ross remounted than his horse was shot. Lieutenant Collis again went back, and got him to mount behind on his own horse. The couple had ridden some fifty yards when the Lieutenant's horse was dropped by a bullet. Both then took to their heels. Private Dodson came back and insisted on Lieutenant Collis getting up behind him. This he did, but finding when they had gone a short distance that the horse was unable to carry both, he again dismounted. Private Dunn returned, and Lieutenant Collis mounted behind him. As, however, the Boers rapidly gained on them, he dropped off and ordered Dunn to save himself. Sergeant Freeman, although by this time wounded, galloped back to save his officer. Lieutenant Collis refused assistance, and directed the sergeant to make good his escape. Hardly had he turned away when the rider and horse were shot. Finding that Sergeant Freeman was mortally wounded, Lieutenant Collis ran some hundred and fifty yards, and then concealed himself in the scrub. The Boers came up and examined Sergeant Freeman as he lay on the ground. They fired several shots in the direction of Lieutenant Collis, and then retreated. After walking four miles Lieutenant Collis came upon a patrol of the Inniskillings and safely reached camp. Private Ross is missing. These gallant deeds took place under a heavy fire at close range. At the Burial of General Wauchope Modder River, December 13th, 1899 Hark! thro' the solemn air, Highland pipes are wailing âThe flowers of the forest are all weed away!â Light from the blood of the sunset sky is failing, Long from our hearts has faded all the day. Sad sound the river trees, Modder stream is sighing! Stream that ran red with our passion and our gore! Here, by their shallow grave, forty men are lying, Men who shall hear Modder sobbing so no more. Men with the maddened look of battle on their faces, Men with fierce lips unloosened still in death, Men praised in peace, and the first of warrior races Deadâere a bayonet was drawn from its sheath. Eyes of the forty men in fury upward staring! What do they look for so fixedly and fain? They look for the laird whom his comrades four are bearing. They wait for the general to lead them once again. Then while the sixteen pipes are piping mournfullyâ Arms all reversed, but as proud as on parade, Comes with the chieftain who faced his doom so scornfully, All that is left of themâthe Highlanders' Brigade. Hark ye! from Edinburgh, bells in every steeple Mingle their tollings with the pipers' sound, Hark! lamentations of the Niddry people Mourning in pit-villages, and moaning underground. Will you not rouse now, Wauchope, just to cheer them, Greet them again with a smile and merry word? You, with the laird's heart of honour ever near them; They, with their honour for your home-love and your sword. Nay, Wauchope, rest, on the veldt, till doom awaken, Rest with your Highlanders, painless, battlefree! Mouths firmly-set, rifles gripped and fist fierce shaken, These wake and watch, these avengers shall be. Vengeance is man's! God's way shall come with healing! Love yet may bloom by fateful Modder shore! But never hearts shall hear with such appealing Pipes play o'er fallen ones, âLochaber no more.â Note.âThe description of the burial of General Wauchope given by the Daily News correspondent is as follows:â âThree hundred yards to the rear of the little township of Modder River, just as the sun was sinking in a blaze of African splendour, on the evening of Tuesday, the 13th of December, a long shallow grave lay exposed in the breast of the veldt. To the westward the broad river, fringed with trees, ran murmuringly, to the eastward the heights still held by the enemy scowled menacingly; north and south the veldt undulated peacefully; a few paces to the northward of that grave fifty Highlanders lay, dressed as they had fallen on the field of battle; they had followed their chief to the field, and they were to follow him to the grave. How grim and stern those dead men looked as they lay face upward to the sky, with great hands clenched in the last death agony, and brows still knitted with the stern lust of the strife in which they had fallen. The plaids dear to every Highland clan were represented there, and, as I looked, out of the distance came the sound of the pipes; it was the General coming to join his men. There, right under the eyes of the enemy, moved with slow and solemn tread, all that remained of the Highland Brigade. In front of them walked the chaplain, with bared head, dressed in his robes of office, then came the pipers, with their pipes (sixteen in all), and behind them, with arms reversed, moved the Highlanders, dressed in all the regalia of their regiments, and in the midst the dead General, borne by four of his comrades. Out swelled the pipes to the strains of âThe Flowers of the Forest,â now ringing proud and high until the soldiers' heads went back in haughty defiance, and eyes flashed through tears like sunlight on steel; now sinking to a moaning wail like a woman mourning for her firstborn, until the proud heads dropped forward till they rested on heaving chests, and tears rolled down the wan and scarred faces, and the choking sobs broke through the solemn rhythm of the march of death. Right up to the grave they marched, then broke away in companies, until the General lay in the shallow grave with a Scottish square of armed men around him; only the dead man's son and a small remnant of his officers stood with the chaplain and the pipers whilst the solemn service of the Church was spoken. Then once again the pipes pealed out, and âLochaber No Moreâ cut through the stillness like a cry of pain, until one could almost hear the widow in her Highland home moaning for the soldier she would welcome back no more. Then, as if touched by the magic of one thought, the soldiers turned their tear-damp eyes from the still form in the shallow grave towards the heights where Cronje, the âlion of Africa,â and his soldiers stood. Then every cheek flushed crimson, and the strong jaws set like steel, and the veins on the hands that clasped the rifle handles swelled almost to bursting with the fervour of the grip, and that look from those silent armed men spoke more eloquently than ever spoke the tongues of orators. For on each frowning face the spirit of vengeance sat, and each sparkling eye asked silently for blood.â A Timely Confession December 15th Lord of the Judgment-arm for ever sure, We do confess our sin that it was great, Strong in our pride, contemptuous in debate, We scorned the farm-bred patriarchal Boer; We let the diamond dust and golden lure Dim and bedazzle eyes half-blind for hate, Dreamed war begun and ended, set the date; And planned as if our victory were secure. Wherefore, in mercy lest the pillars fall Of this Heaven-ordered, this imperial realm, Thou hast decreed that, humbled to the dust By these veldt shepherds and their mountain wall, We should, ere arrogant bluster overwhelm, Learn that our God who made us great is just. Resolute December 16th Not with wild barrack song and heedless breath, Not with light-hearted boast of man and power To tread the burgher underâin this hour Of solemn pause, disastrous pain and death, Does Britain once again her sword unsheath; Rather with thought of that transcendent dower Of strength that in adversity will flower, She turns to claim once more the victor's wreath. Dark are her cottage-homes and dark her halls,â Fierce serpent spite is hissing round the earth! ââBehold, the Titan totters on his throne!â But resolute love and loyalty have birth, And out of Heaven an angel trumpet calls,â âNot yet for God the allotted task is done!â The Sailing of the âMaineâ December 23rd Hail! all hail to the âMaine.â Is it she who sank to her tomb With death and war in her womb? She for whose loss and whose pain The great West fought against Spain? With life for the Motherland, Love from the Brotherland. Lo, from the deeps has she risen again? Ocean hearken and heed, Give us your silence and your calm, So, more swift with her balm And healing for all who need, The âMaineâ to their succour shall speed, With help from the Brotherland, Hope for the Motherland, Blessing and joy by her merciful deed. God give her sun all the day, God give her stars all the night, God give her mariners might. Never the engines stay, Nor captain slack of his way! The thanks of the Motherland, Health from the Brotherland, These are her passengers bound for the Bay. Ay, as a mother her son Hides in her heart evermore, Prays as he sails from the shore, So are we praying that none Ever forget this deed done. Love of the Brotherland, Life for the Motherland, Now shall the nations henceforward be one. A Generous Life-Guardsman Men know me as a Coldstream Guard, And how I lived I cannot tell; The whisker on my face was charred, I saw the flash and fell. The Boer who did the dastard deed Had wrapped his grey-white neckerchief About his rifleâseemed to plead So sorely for relief. I thought or Boer or Briton, all A cry for help can understand. I could not talk his catawaul, And so I reached a handâ When, swift as lightning, lo! he brought His rifle round, and straight let fly; I, swifter still, as swift as thought Ducked, and the ball went by. Then with my bayonet parrying free I dashed his rifle stock in two; And talked in British language he Seemed quite to feel was due. âYou murdering, treacherous cur!â I cried. God grant me pardon, how I swore; I cursed till heart was satisfied And breath could curse no more. Quite at my mercy, gaunt and grim, There lay the wounded, tattered man. He looked at meâI looked at himâ And Pity through me ran. I gave my flask and, mad with thirst, He clutched it with a fevered grip, Then motioned me to drink it first And pledged me fellowship. Forth from his bleeding breast he drew A picture of a child and wife, His tears rained down, and well I knew How sore he needed life. I smiled and nodded, and he smiled, He seemed to know what words I meant, And so I bore him like a child Back to the doctor's tent. Note.âAt one of the battles of the Relief Column on its way to Kimberley, a guardsman went forward to succour a wounded Boer who had put up a white flag. The Boer fired on him at close quarters, but the bullet missed its billet. The gallant guardsman disarmed his treacherous enemy, and took him back to the hospital tent. An Arm-Chair Critic I am sitting here in my easy chair, If the cat purred loud I should turn to scold; Flowers from Italy scent the air, The servant who gave the paper a fold Rustled it well, as if to say, âNews from the front, my lord, to-day.â They are sitting there in the trenches grim, Deaf for the cannon, black for the smoke, The last faint flower of hope is dim, The foe through the strongest lines have broke. Famished, they fold tired hands and say, âTo die is all we can do to-day.â Yet here as I sit I am talking grand Of what born fools our generals areâ I, whose millions were made in the Rand; I, for whose mines we are now at warâ And all I find in my heart to say Is, let who love fighting fightâI pay. The dinner is served and we fall to talk: âMethuen's incompetent! Buller's a fool! The War Office, hardly able to walk, Must go to a French or a German school.â Sirs, if we Britons talk this way, No wonder the battle was lost to-day! A Man of Straw at Ladysmith We set him up against the skyâ A Tommy full of chaff and daring; The Boer commando wondered why, They cocked their rifles and let fly, But not a straw was Tommy caring. They shot him three times thro' the head, As unconcerned as any mummy He stood his ground; alive or dead, He little recked of bullet lead, For he was just a well-stuffed dummy. Then did the Boers lose heart of grace, And sent to Joubert for to ax him A big gun Tommy to displace; But he was bold enough to face The music still of gun or Maxim. At last a hundred-pounder hits, And while all Ladysmith is laughingâ To think she fooled the Boerish wits, Chaff-stuffed, poor Tommy goes to bits, And all the marksmen get isâchaffing. Note.âThe following is an extract from a letter written by a correspondent of the Natal Witness, who escaped from Ladysmith:â âSeveral of our soldiers were guilty of very shabby tricks on the guileless Boer. A squadron of Lancers in one of their patrols took with them one day a Lancer of straw. This figure was left near the Boer position, and viewed from a distance looked a veritable cavalryman. The figure was left on a rock, and it was not long before the Boers were having shots at the soldier who so daringly exposed himself. Mauser bullets had no effect, and it is alleged that, getting exasperated, the Boers turned one of their big guns on the dummy. The truth was discovered only after a vast quantity of ammunition had been wasted. The Liverpools one day set up a row of effigies, and the Boers were driven nearly crazy by the indifference these men showed to their fire. Then there was the bogus artillery some of our people constructed one night on the Town Lands in front of Umbulwana. There were figures of men and something which looked like 15-pounders. The Boers blazed away at this battery, and âknocked particular ? ? out of it,â as an artilleryman, with many delighted grins, said, only to find out that they were being fooled.â Old Mortality A SKETCH AT LADYSMITH With rifle, bible, luncheon-bag, and pipe, We saw him going forth each day to snipe; We watched him on the foemen get his bead Then fire, then turn his Holy Book to read, Some chapter from the Kings would suit his case, That told how Israel smote a godless race, How hip and thigh, at Heaven's august command The Hebrew drove the Hivite from the land; He could not wish the modern Hivites well Seeing we hid in holes from shot and shell; Or else from Kings he turned for hope and calm To Kruger's late commended battle-psalm. Psalm xxxiii. Then could we note how he would luncheon take âHis bit of biltong and his barley-cake, Or sudden sighting scouts upon the hill Would lay his rifle true again with skill; Then scratch his head and fill his ancient pipe, Puff clouds, till chance once more should bid him snipe; And so till evening sit and smoke and read, Or on the far-off foeman get his bead, Then rise, and from his boulder steal away In hopes of more success another day. We called him âOld Mortality,â and came Almost with love to think upon his nameâ This Bible-reading, smoking, sniping Boer, Whose shots were frequent tho' his bag was poor; And tho' his humour was a little grim, We sighed when Death the Sniper called for him. Home from the Front for Christmas Day My body lies upon the ground, My soul has slipped away, I hardly felt the sting of wound So savage was the fray. We fought, but whom we could not see; We stormed the mountain side, Where every boulder seemed to be A rifleâand we died. I fell; with lightning flash my mind Turned longingly for home; I passed o'er land and seas to find That Christmastide had come. The bells were ringing down the vale, The people walked to pray, âGod send usââso I heard them hailâ âA merrier Christmas Day!â âThis is a sorry time,â they said, âFor Peace and for Goodwill, Eight hundred wounded, lost or dead, The Boers unshifted still!â I whispered! âOthers mourn for blood Poured forth, for others fell, âShocked into dying as they stood By burst of British shell.â The children passed, a merry band, My spirit eyes were dim, I, too, went once with book in hand, To sing the Christmas Hymn. The sexton stood with smile and nod To greet the gathering crowd. âThe Christ is born, give praise to God,â The eight bells rang aloud. Breathed sweet of holly leaves and warm The church threw wide its door, With Christmas look and Christmas charm, And peace for rich and poor. I entered in, my mother knelt At her accustomed place, Her face was hid, but ah! I felt The tears were on her face. âLord, cover Thou mine own son's head In battle day,â she cried, She knew not that her boy was dead, And I was at her side. She knew not in Tugela's sun My body rotting lay; But she could hear the foeman gun Boom murder far away. âForgive the people, Lord, we pray, Who knowing of Thy will, Come worshipping on Christmas Day, But send our lads to kill.â âOh! God,â she groaned, âmake battles cease Where'er men fighting are; This is the day ordained for peace, Then wherefore give us war?â The reader for the lesson took Isaiah's words of old; I muttered, âClose that holy book, Not peace ye seek, but gold.â Then did the preacher choose for text, âPeace and on earth good-will.â My spirit murmured, sorely vexed, âThen Christians wherefore kill?â But all the while my mother's face Beside the pillar there, So spake to God that still the place It seemed a place of prayer. And I was glad that I had died, And come from far away, If but to know how mother cried For peace, that Christmas Day. War and the Old Folks' Creed Once more old folks we greet and meet, But some old friends are gone away; Where'er they are, their rest is sweetâ We cannot wish them back to-day. Beyond the sound of mortal strife That plunges half a world in tears, They live in peace a fuller life, They know no pain of failing years. Yet we who meet around this board Are not unhappy: crack and fun Go forward, as if never sword Were drawn, nor Boer had fired a gun. Our sixty years have set us far From sorrow of the trumpet's call; This is our sons' and daughters' war: Their children fight, their children fall. But we have had our sorrow's store; We know what Balaclava meant; We heard the muskets round Cawnpore; Our few came back, our many went. And this we folk of sixty years Assembled at these tables say: God never planned these wars and tears, And Peace is the Diviner way. Note.âAt Keswick, each year, in Christmas week, all old people over 60 years are invited to what is locally known as âThe Old Folks' Dinner.â These verses were recited at the Old Folks' Dinner of 1899. To Lord Roberts ON HIS DEPARTURE FROM ENGLAND AS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF IN SOUTH AFRICA December 23, 1899 When by Tugela's bank the Terrible Ones Thundered in vain their storm upon the wall, And sudden, caught by hail of rifle ball, Our men and horse went down beside the guns; Then learned we well how true the red blood runs From sire to child, for many brave did fall, But none more swift to hear his country's call Than that heroic soul that is your son's. Go forth grey-headed warrior whom we loveâ Known by familiar name the army thro', Go forthâthe son who in these five short years Had faced the Pathan, met the Mahdi's spears, Lies in calm earth your hand must fight above, That holy grave claims guardianship of you. Britain's New Year January 1, 1900 She sees the lips of half the nations curled, She hears the serpent hiss of whispering hate Mutter âBehold this Britain, that is great, Reels and from off her ancient throne is hurled.â But still for right her banners are unfurled, For justice are her sons confederate, And bruised and brave she doth her hour await, With resolute calm she fronts a wondering world. One hand, one heart, she greets the coming year, Knowing that deeper far within her soul Than greed of power or Mammon's deadly lust, Lies hunger to fulfil her Heavenly trust, And claiming equal good for far and near, To bring fair Freedom to her ultimate goal. The Last Question The curse of battle has its antidote, His were brave words, heart-medicine to give, Who dumb, because his face was shot away, Took pencil in his dying hand, and wrote NotââDoctor, have I any time to live?â ButââDoctor, did we win the fight to-day?â Note.âThis incident was noted by Dr. Treves after the battle of Spion Kop, and was chronicled by him as an example of the pluck and spirit with which our brave men endured their terrible wounds, and forgot their pain in the cause of Queen and Country. To the Men of the Border Regiment, Cumberland sends thanks and greetings for 1900 Borderers! Borderers! gallant and true! Cumberland eyes are all gazing on you, You who will answer when duty calls To storm the terrible mountain walls. From âspruitâ and from âdongaâ to drive the foe, Over the âdriftsâ to the rescue to go, And shoulder to shoulder and hand to hand To fight for your Queen and for Fatherland. Borderers! Borderers! gallant and true! Cumberland hearts are all praying for you, Cumberland eyes and Cumberland prayers Go with the Borderer boy who dares. A Graveside Memory at Colesberg Tenderly down the hill we bore them, Riddled with bullets, shattered with shell; Never a cry was lifted o'er them, Never a tear above them fell. Friendlily came the Boers beside them, Muttered, âPoor fellows, so worn and thin!â Helped us to hollow the trench to hide them, Helped us to carefully lay them in. Hornily-handed, rough of faces, All their battle wrath passed away; It seemed the hearts of the sundered races Were one for love of the dead that day. Solemnly, then, we read the verses âAshes to ashes! dust to dust!â And gave our mates to the last of nursesâ The pitiful earth in whose peace we trust. Kindlily up there stepped a foeman, Stepped to the grave and prayed a prayer, Never a son of a British woman But felt the breath of the Lord was there. Faithfully, humbly, did he pray itâ Prayed to the Father of foe and friend To look from Heaven at last and stay it, Make of this terrible war an end. Plaintively then uprose their chorusâ A hymn to the God of the warless years; The tender heart of a girl came o'er us; We sobbed, and turned from the grave in tears. Note.âAn old Bedford Modern boy, Rupert Brearey, now at the front with the R.A.M. Corps, writes as follows, from Colesberg, under date January 7th, 1900:â âOne of the Boer Medical Officers rode to us under a Red Cross flag and asked us to go and bury our dead, which, of course, we did. But the sight of those poor fellows lying on the hill, some of them dreadfully riddled with bullets, I can never forget. The Boers were very good; in fact, one would hardly have thought that they were our enemies. They talked to us quite freely, and helped us to dig the grave and to carry the dead. There was one very touching little incident. After our Major had read the Burial Service (from the Prayer Book L. and D. gave me in January, 1896), one of the Boers stepped out and said a short prayer, hoping the war would soon end, and while we stood with heads uncovered they sang a hymn in Dutch. It cut our fellows up very much indeed; in fact we could not speak for some time.â The Dead Boy and the Dying Boer My hands are knotted, my face is scarred, My heart for a human heart is tough, For a mounted policeman's life is hard, And the ways of the veldt and the vaal are rough. But I cried like a child a week ago, And felt as weak as a boy again, For tears that had long forgotten to flow, Came tumbling down on my hand like rain. It was after the battle,âI found a man Propped on his arm: he was breathing fast: I knew by the way the red blood ran, And the sweat of his brow, that he could not last. But I put my foot on his rifle sure, For a serpent scotched will sometimes turn, And a snake in the grass is a wounded Boer, As all who fight in the veldt may learn. And he raised his head and he gave a groan, And he said, âMy friend, too late! farewell! Look to the others, leave me alone, But where is the boy at my side when I fell.â So I searched the wreck of the ghastly pile God meant for life, by the shattered gun, And I saw in the midst a face with a smile Set fast by Death,âI had found his son. I wiped the stain of blood from his face, That boy at his side when the father fell, And the cry of pity, the fierce embrace Of dead with the dying, I scarce may tell. âAh; God be praised! we shall meet so soon! For the old veldt farm it was good you died!â Then his head sunk back in the last long swoon. And father and son stood side by side. Note.âThis incident was described in a letter from one of the bearer companies' men after a battle:â âWe were out looking after the wounded at night, when the fight was over, when I came across an old, white-bearded Boer. He was lying behind a bit of rock supporting himself on his elbows. I was a bit wary of the old fellow at first. Some of these wounded Boers, we've found, are snakes in the grass. You go up to them with the best intentions. and the next thing you know is that the man you were going to succour is blazing at you with his gun. âSo,â the letter goes on, âI kept my eye on the old chap. But when I got near I saw that he was too far gone to raise his rifle. He was gasping hard for breath, and I saw he was not long for this world. He motioned to me that he wanted to speak, and I bent over him. He asked me to go and find his sonâa boy of thirteen who had been fighting by his side when he fell. âWell, I did as he asked me,â continues the writer, âand under a heap of wounded I found the poor lad, stone dead, and I carried him back to his father. Well, you know I'm not a chicken-hearted sort of a fellow. I have seen a bit of fighting in my time, and that sort of thing knocks all the soft out of a chap. âBut,â this correspondent confesses, âI had to turn away when the old Boer saw his dead lad. He hugged the body to him and moaned over it, and carried on in a way that fetched a big lump in my throat. Until that very moment I never thought how horrible war is. I never wanted to see another shot fired. And when I looked round again the old Boer was dead, clasping the cold hand of his dead boy.â A Gunner's Story The Battle of Colenso, 15th December, 1899 I am the eldest of mother's sons, She is a widow, she drew my pay; I fell in trying to save the guns; But my heart was glad when the ball went through; How else could I dare to be talking with you, Seeing we gave the guns away? Timber of limber and coil of steel, Light to gallop with, strong to stand, None are made swifter death to deal; But ah! I was glad when that ball went thro'; If I had been spared to be seen of you, How could I face my native land? No scouts ahead! it may well seem strange, Of foes in the river we had no thought; Our Colonel wanted a closer range; I was glad when the rifle-ball went thro', How else should I dare to be talking with you, Seeing we knew not what we ought? My breech-block scarcely had closed on shell, When forth of the ambush volleyings came, And every horse of the battery fell; Ah! sir, I am glad that the ball went thro', For now I can dare to be talking with you; It is easier here to bear the blame, And out of the silence, I tell you true, We died at our guns and we both died game. Note.âWhen the last shell had been fired, it is said that the two remaining gunners, rather than desert their gun, stood at attention and so died. Another Philip Sydney Colenso Our selfless heroes are not dead, The nation is at heart as one, And wheresoe'er brave blood is shed, We see the untarnished golden thread First wove by Sydney's noble son. Hodge here at home is simple hind, Hodge found in war is of king's breed; Deep down within his soldier mind Is set the will to help his kind, Even unto death, at comrade's need. And I, a surgeon in the glare Of that ill-starred Colenso day, There, on the ground, blood-drenched and bare Was sudden of a true knight 'ware, Who gave his life the royal way. Shot thro' the body, and in pain He writhed, his lips too parched to speak. I knew a surgeon's help was vain, Too long untended had he lain; His breath came swift, his pulse was weak. A water bearer by me ran, I cried aloud, âfor God's dear grace Give succour to a dying man!â He stooped to bring his water-can Full front before the fevered face. A clenched fist waved the can away, The sun-baked lips, nigh black with thirst, Moved, and I heard him slowly say: âOthers will need it more to-day, My mate must feel its comfort first. âWorse hit than I, he needs it more, Tell him my share I gladly give, I shall not last beyond the roar Of battle, thirst will soon be o'er; Bid him drink deep, thank God, and live.â He drank and lives;âthe other died, His thirst unquenchedâto save a friend; His bones Colenso's kopjes hide, But he who waved that cup aside Saw Christ smile on him ere the end. Note.âThe following little story is told by Mr. Frederick Treves, the well-known surgeon, in a letter he has sent to the British Medical Journal, detailing the battle of Colenso: âOn all sides there is evidence that our soldiers behaved splendidly on the field, and I can say that when brought back wounded they were plucky, patient, and uncomplaining. Their unselfishness was many times very marked. An orderly was bringing some water to a wounded man lying on the ground near me. He was shot through the abdomen, and he could hardly speak owing to the dryness of his mouth, but he said, âTake it to my pal first; he is worse hit than me.â This generous lad died next morning, but his pal got through and is doing well.â In Memory of the late Earl of Ava At Elands Laagte, for want of a mount, he gallantly acted as galloper to his Colonel all through the day on foot. He fell fighting at Ladysmith. Beneath the pillared halls and purple hill Of fair Athene, stands in carven stone The man who brought the news from Marathon, And died in act of bringing; for his will O'ertaxed the heart that would its speed fulfil, And broke it as he shouted âWe have won!â Our Britain boasts her battle-carrier sonâ Ah! would to God his heart were beating still. He too shall have the warrior's heart's meed Who, light-foot as the deer of Clandeboye, Ran without horse that dreadful battle morn; Through storm of bullets urged his topmost speed, That so his Colonel's word might well be borne, And Briton's heart might feel the conqueror's joy. The Day of Intercession A VILLAGE HYMN God, in Whose hand the issues are, When nations rage with fire and sword, By Whose decree the scourge of war Fulfils a more than mortal word, Let battle-pride and warrior-lust Henceforth lie silent in the dust. With Thee the centuries are in sight, Thou dost the far-off future plan When right shall triumph over might, And brotherhood be known to man; Lord, in this dreadful battle-hour, Reveal Thy face and come with power. Make humble all that was too high, To chastened eyes in mercy show Where true imperial treasures lie; Cast down the lofty, raise the low; And out of pain, by loss subdued, Lead forth a faithful multitude. Give strength and calm in good and ill, Be with the fallen, foe or friend; Lord God of Hosts, if, by Thy will We stand victorious at the end, Give us Thy help divine to be More just, more merciful for Thee. The City Imperial Volunteers at St. Paul's Saturday, January 13, 1900 âFight the good fight, with all thy might!â Our music echoed from the walls; It filled the dome with sound and light, It shook the cross upon St. Paul's. The great cathedral-church's womb Was stirred and quick for life and birth, The Duke rose up within his tomb And came again with power to earth. âFight as I fought the fight who stood On Albuera's fateful day, At Badajoz when drenched in blood Our thousands cast their lives away. âFight the good fight! maintain the right!ââ The right of all men to be freeâ The God who armed my soul for fight, Shall lead us still to victory.â There, as I listened, lo, a hymn Came over fields made waste by war, A grand Te Deum seemed to swim Up-borne on wings of praise from far. In Ladysmith's beleaguered town Safe-gathered to a house of prayer, I saw the soldier chieftains own The God of Battle's love and care. Before the altar step they bent, The scars of fight were on their brow, A soldier's oathâthe Sacramentâ Was never sworn with fuller vow. And standing in the holy place, War-weary, grim with battle stain, They thanked their God for all His grace, And sang the grand Te Deum strain. No wonder that the echoing walls Had called the Iron Duke from rest; No marvel that the great St. Paul's Was filled with melody he blest. âFight the good fight! maintain the right!â Lord God, our sons, where'er they be, Shall feel Thy presence is their might, And, conquerors, shall remember Thee. LADYSMITH, JAN. 8 (BY RUNNER TO PIETERMARITZBURG, JAN. 17). Yesterday (Sunday), Jan. 7th, a solemn thanksgiving service to Almighty God for His blessing upon our arms, was held in the Anglican Church. The building was crowded, chiefly by soldiers. The congregation also included General Sir George White, General Sir Archibald Hunter, Colonel Ian Hamilton, and other Staff officers. At the conclusion of the sermon by Archdeacon Barker, General White and his Staff, at the invitation of the Archdeacon, proceeded to the altar rails, and there stood whilst a Te Deum was sung. It was a most impressive spectacle, and it came to a thrilling conclusion by the singing by the congregation of âGod Save the Queen.â Mistaken Kindness He's an absent-minded beggarâthat's no reason we should take Advantage of poor Tommy's absent mind, Blow him up with pies, at parting, till his belt begins to break, Fill him full of parting-liquor till he's blind. He's an absent-minded beggar, but he's going over sea To do the solemn thing he's got to do, To pound away at Kruger and the Boers for you and me, And to give his life for Queen and country too. He's an absent-minded beggarâthen why hand him three months' pay Just to fool away in drinking ere he goes; Keep his pay! and give him baccy for a pipe upon the way! And send him brave but sober on his foes. We are absent-minded beggarsâif we feel a twinge of shame As we see Reservists rolling down the street, Please remember in our kindness we were cruel all the same When we stood the absent-minded beggar treat. [Extract from the letter of the Bishop of Chester in the Chester Courant, January 3, 1900: OUR DEPARTING RESERVISTSâMISTAKEN HOSPITALITY. âSir,âMay I be allowed to express what I know to be the strong and widely felt regret that, through a well-meant but most cruel kindness, our Reservists are being tempted at the solemn and touching hour of farewell to become the victims of drink? We all honour the Reservists for their splendid patriotism. We are all resolved, not only to look after their wives and families during their absence, but to provide them with wholesome comforts for their start and journey. Our Mayor is giving us the lead, but the scenes of excess due to illjudged hospitality which have been heard of in other cities and which are, I fear, not unknown in Chester, shock, and ought to shock, the public conscience. It is a most unhallowed and ill-omened beginning of what is in itself a noble enterprise. The responsibility lies at the door, not of the military authorities, who detest the whole thing, but partly at least at the doors of mistaken friends and admirers. In the earnest hope that sympathy and admiration may take a more manly and Godly shape, and that the Reservists themselves may shew that they have moral as well as physical courage, I have the honour to remain, your obedient servant, âF. J. Cestr. âThe Palace, Chester, January 2, 1900.â N.B.âBy the Service regulations the Reservists are allowed to withdraw the balance of their reserve-pay, which usually amounts to about &amp; Â£3, at the moment of mobilisation and departure. This is questionable wisdom.] To the High Court of Parliament At this time under Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen Assembled February 5, 1900 You with the fear of God before your eyes now, You who remember whence our fathers sprung, In the hushed Parliament will ye not arise now, Shame with your words sincere the double tongue Now, while the work of countless generations Hangs in the balance, to a grain of dust, Whether it win the mocking of the nations Or prove victorious, merciful and just. Will ye not say, foreknowing all the sorrowâ Lovers of peace but wielders of the swordâ We, with the hope of larger peace to-morrow, Keep for all children of the flag our word. Say, that beyond all Charters men decry for us, Dearer than gold or diamond's dazzling fee, This is our CharterâFaith with all who die for us, This is our goldâthe love of liberty. Say that the gauge is cast, the doom decided. Let those who fear, misdoubting of the end, Know that the nation, one and undivided, Claims the true heart that quails not now, for friend. Yea, tell it forth most solemn and unhastingly, Somewhere, behind our wondrous battle-swarm, God with His Will to usward everlastingly Hides His deep purpose, and we trust His arm. A Cry from Cape Town to Westminster February 6th, 1900 The House is filled with barren cries And clamour of debateâ There on the veldt a trooper lies, Beyond all noise and hate. He died; but for no party cause; One light before him shone: His country's claim, his Queen's applauseâ He left the task half done. Sick of this windy, wordy war, The soul of England turns To where, beneath a nobler star, Her flag of honour burns. Is this a time for party gain? To Britain's Council Hall The hundreds captive, hundreds slain, Cry âHelp us! one and all!â Was it for âcock-shyâ or for game Of factionâwhite and blackâ The Great Colonial Empire came To drive the invader back? I hear a voice from half the world: âCease, brothers, praise or blame, Lest freedom from her throne be hurled, And Peace be but a name!â The Bugler's Wish âWhat shall we give to you, bugler boy, For the bugle they lost in Tugela's wave The day you fell on Colenso plain?â And the bugler-laddie he answered brave, âGive?âgive me leave, in the Queen's employ, To go to the Front with my bugle again!â When the Royal party were going through the wards at Netley Hospital one of the Princesses asked the little bugler Dunne, who was the first to fall wounded in the Colenso fight, and whose bugle was thrown into the Tugela as he was being carried in to the hospital tent, what mark of favour he would wish the Queen to bestow on him, and he answered cheerily, âLeave to go to the Front again!â To the Hero of Kimberley February 16th, 1900 Britain sends to her hero greeting: Thrice has filled and has failed the moon, But you it is who have kept hearts beating Brave in the leaguer, at night and noon: Sprung from Lincolnshire, nursed in Devonshire, Yours is a name that shall not fade soon. Kekewich! you thro' the storm and smother, A hundred days with their hundred ills, You welded the white to his black-faced brother, You cheered their spirit, confirmed their wills, Slept by snatches and kept your watches, and Saved the Town of the Diamond Hills. Kekewich! even the dead rejoice now, Kimberley riflemen, men of the rose The Loyal Lancastrians, upon whom, with the Kimberley Rifles, the brunt of the siege fell, wear as a badge the Red Rose of the House of Lancaster. He, too, the gallant, Major Scott-Turner, who was killed as he led one of the sorties during the siege of Kimberley, will ever be remembered as one of the heroes of the beleaguered town. tho' hushed his voice now, First to flame from your gate on the foes; Heroes, a crowd of them, Britain is proud of them, Yea, as she thanks you, she thinks upon those. Pat O'Leary's Grave He was the life and soul of all, On march, in camp, so blithe and cheery, The merriest heart e'er pierced by ball, But laughterless lay Pat O'Leary. About our fallen friend we stood, We felt the blankness of to-morrow, The sword of broken brotherhood Pierced every heart with pain and sorrow. We wrapped him in his blanket shroud, There in his shallow grave we laid him, And vows of vengeance fiercely vowed, Vowsâah, how powerless to aid him! No priest was there, no book nor rite, No cloudy censer o'er him swinging; And minds just cooling from a fight Forgot all solemn words for singing. But we remembered Christ's own prayer, And calm and peace its saying brought us, As leaning on our rifles there We prayed the words our mothers taught us: âOur Father,â we are brothers still; The march is hardâthe camp more dreary, But somewhere, cheerly, up the hill He'll lead us homeward, Pat O'Leary. Note.âA soldier writing home says: âWe helped to bury the poor fellow, who was the life and soul of us; but the Major had not got a prayer-book, and we could none of us remember the right collects, and so we just stood round the grave, and all together said âOur Father.ââ Love, the Conqueror He was a man of rugged face, A hundred battles in his eyes, He listened to a piteous case, He had compassion on the cries. Her lord in that beleaguered town Lay hurt to death by shot and shell, And love far over land had flown To look one look and say farewell. He heard her tale and muttered low âLove is more strong than fire or sword.â He bade her passâthat gallant foeâ And sent her to her dying lord. Line after line the foeman sent Swift challenge, swifter answer came, Safe on her way the brave wife went And took for escort Joubert's name. Scarred faces crept from underground To gaze upon that gentle form, Grim holders they of trench and mound, A woman's heart alone could storm. She passed thro' ramparts battle-worn, Down streets ploughed deep by hurtling shell; She found him near to death, forlorn Of hope, for whom she dared so well. Rough men were melted into tears To think how nobly love had striven, And three times three our British cheers For gallant Joubert went to Heaven. Note.âA message dated Ladysmith, Feb. 17th.ââMuch regret is felt for the death of Major Dufton, an able and popular officer of the Light Horse, who was severely wounded during one of the recent fights, and had his arm amputated. His wife, on hearing by heliograph of his condition, asked for and obtained permission from General Joubert, through General White, to pass through the Boer lines that she might nurse her dying husband.â Saturday Night and Sunday Morn A Contrast, February 24-25 SATURDAY NIGHT Now sleep is on the mountain tarn, And silence in the vale; I hear the herdman shut the barn And hang the milking-pail. Unto our lowly cottage stars The great stars shine above, And over Wythop's western bars God lights the lamp of love. Of one more week of care and moil The dale is dispossest, And all who till and all who toil Turn gratefully to rest. But there, in fields forlorn of peace, Foe stands with foe at bay, And loud with war that cannot cease Grim rolls the earth to day. SUNDAY MORNING From out the vale the clouds are drawn To join their angel throng, Through dusky boughs to dewy lawn The thrush begins his song. This is the day our shepherds hold Their Sabbath; up the fells, Across the lake, by farm and fold, I hear the Crosthwaite bells. With dream of Heaven the mellow chime Floats up and fills the air, Hands worn with labour now have time To clasp and close in prayer. There with worn hands that know no sleep, Stern Cronje and his braves In Sabbath hope are digging deep The refuge of their graves. The Queen at Netley They spake not, but their wounds were eloquent As there they stood in hospital array, The pain of sword and bullet passed away While on from ward to ward Victoria went; And here she thanked them for their brave intent, There for some tender question would she stay; Here speak with sorrow of the battle day, There smile such smile as more than praises meant. Lady revered, for whom all men endure The heat of onset gladly, and the cold Of loss and failure, love is ever green To crown your royal head with more than gold; When all the thrones are shaken yours is sure, Seeming so much more mother than a Queen. Note.âOne of the Gordon Highlanders, writing of the Queen's visit to Netley to see the wounded, said, âIt was the proudest moment of my life; the Queen spoke to us all; she seemed much more a mother than a Queen.â To Colonel Baden-Powell Mafeking Stout heart! defender! How shall we tender Thanks, and how render Homage sincere! You, in sore plight for us, You, who made fight for us, You, who kept bright for us All we hold dear! You, who unquailing Faced all assailing, With wits unfailing, Met lure with lure. Courage unquenchable, Purpose unwrenchable, With mound and trench able Still to endure. From shelter creeping, Tireless watch keeping, You, the unsleeping, Woke while we slept. Cheered the uncheery ones, Healed the wound-weary ones, Helped the heart-dreary ones, Safe the town kept. Fate unremorseful Frowned, but resourceful, Splendidly forceful, You stood at bay. Fullâyou made fight of it, Starvedâyou made light of it, Unsuccoured, spite of it, Laughed Death away. You so far sundered, Tho' their guns thundered, While a world wondered, Stuck to your plan. Now from your prison free, Lead forth to liberty, And let the nation see Her bravest man. To Kronje on Majuba Day February 27th Kronje, on this inglorious battle day That gave you deathless glory on the hill, Whose crown of honour and dishonour still Is as a crown of sorrow and dismay For all who strive for peace; now held at bay, At last must Britain bend you to her will, And all your warrior wit and soldier skill, Your hate, your pride, must silent pass away. But, Kronje, by the Modder long shall stand The trench, the mound, that in your sore distress Gave shelter to your fire-encircled band. Memorials of your stubborn-hearted hand, Long shall they tell your grim resourcefulness And praise the laager-king of Koodoosrand. The Relief of Ladysmith TO GENERAL BULLER Ladysmith ours? Now praised be the powers! Here's to you, Buller, my heart and my hand! Bells rouse the people, And flags from each steeple Flutter to utter the joy of the land. Thrice unprevailing, With courage unfailing, Doggedly British, you still dared the deed; Knowing what faced you, You knew how we placed you, Valiant and gallant to help at our need. Thanks like a fountain Shall flow; for each mountain Flame-girt and steel-girt in anger arose, Ridge to ridge yielding More desperate shielding, All the groundâtrench and moundâpacked with the foes. Not that for mothers, For sisters, for brothers, You fought incessantly twelve fighting days, But that you played the game True to our ancient name, Buller! ne'er fuller was Britain of praise. Ladysmith ours? Fly flags from all towers! Half-mast were better! we think of the dead: They who at Freedom's gate Thundered and met their fate, We own them, we crown them; the heroes you led. To General Sir George White Brave, knightly, tender-hearted, tried and true, White, with your twenty thousand cooped up close, Shut in by mountains belching fireâby foes Outflanked, outnumbered, while the four moons grew And waned with pitiless look of death, you knew How thrice to the height of Heaven our good hope rose, How thrice it fellâwith sore increase of woes, While famine more than shell-fire claimed its due. Yet with your inexhaustible gift of grace By fireless hearths you kept our hearts aflame, And tangled in that net by Boerish wiles, Held your beleaguered ring of fourteen miles Inviolate; yea, in Death's own dwelling-place Nursed Life, till Life thro' Death victorious came. In the Burial-Ground at Lady-smith There's a little cypress grove outside the town, There's a little shady slope by Wagon Hill, Where the earth is all new-thrown And the air is very still. But the flag of Britain like a beacon waves Thro' the cypress shade and o'er the fresh-dug ground, And above six hundred graves I can hear a solemn sound. Sound, it seems, of a rejoicing multitude, Who, after sorrow, see an end of pain; âWe have given,â they cry, âour blood, Let our gifts be not in vain!â Retrospect Britain! forget this lamentable year; Fold hands, and turn a little while to sleep! Forget? Nay friends, the wound is far too deep, Seeing in peasant home and hall of peer Sorrow with pride sits silent, and our cheer Makes counterfeit of gladnessâwhile we keep The feast in weeds of woe, and some eyes weep, And some hearts break because there is not tear. Rather remember how war's horror and shame Preached peace upon far mountainsâhow in might The greater land's great courage, like a flame, Rose up, and put all littleness to flight; And how the grey old mother's children came To pour their blood for liberty and right.</field>
