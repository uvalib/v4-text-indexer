      <field name="fulltext">With gentlenesse judge you, At nothing here grudge you; The merry Shoomakers delight in good sport: What here is presented, Be there with contented; And as you doe like it, so give your report.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Haud curo invidiam.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To all the good Yeomen of the Gentle Craft. You that the gentle craft profess, list to my words both more &amp; lesse And I shall tel you many things, of worthy and renowned Kings, And diuers Lords and knights also that were shoomakers long agoe, Some of them in their distresse, delighted in this businesse. And some, for wh? great wait was laid, did saue their liues by this same trade, Other some, in sport and game, delighted much to learne the same, No other Trade in all the Land they thought so fit vnto their hand; For euermore they stil did find, that shoomakers bore a gallant mind, Men they were of high conceit, the which wrought many a merry feat Stout of courage were they still, and in their weapons had great skil, Trauellers by sea and land, each country guise to vnderstand. Wrong they wrought not any man, with reason al things did they seat. Good houses kept they euermore, releeuing both the sicke and poore. In law no mony would they sp?d, their quarels freindly wold they end No malice did they beare to any, but shew'd great fauour vnto many; Offences soone they would forgiue, they would not in contention liue Thus in ioy they spent their daies, with pleasant songs and roundelaies And God did blesse them with content; sufficient for them he sent, And neuer yet did any know, a shoomaker a begging goe: Kind are they one to another, vsing each stranger as his brother. Thus liu'd shoomakers of old, as ancient writers haue it told: And thus shoomakers still would be, so fame from them shall neuer flee. The pleasant Historie of S. Hvgh; and first of all his most constant loue to the faire Virgin Winifred. The Curtizans song of Venice. Ladies. Welcome to Venice, gentle courteous Knight, Cast off fond care, and entertaine content. If any here be gracious in thy sight, Doe but request and she shall soone consent: Loues wings are swift, then be not thou so slow, Hugh. Oh that faire Winifred would once say so. Ladies. With in my lap lye downe thy comely head, And let me stroke those golden locks of thine, Looke on the teares that for thy sake I shed, And be thou Lord of any thing is mine, One gentle looke vpon thy loue bestow. Hugh. Oh that faire Winifred would once say so. Ladies. Embrace with ioy thy Lady in thine armes, And with all pleasures passe to thy delight: If thou doest thinke the light will worke our harmes, Come, come to bed, and welcome all the night, There shalt thou find, what louers ought to know. Hugh. Oh that faire Winifred would once say so. Ladies. Giue me those pearles as pledges of thy loue, Add with those pearles the fauour of thy heart: Doe not from me thy sugred breath remoue, That double comfort giues to euery part. Nay stay sir Knight, from hence thou shalt not goe. Hugh. Oh that faire Winifred would once say so. [The pride of Brittaine is my hearts delight] The pride of Brittaine is my hearts delight, My Lady liues, my true loue to requite: And in her life I liue that else were dead, Like withered Leanes in time of winter shead. She is the ioy and comfort of my mind She is the Sunne that clearest sight doth blind; The fairest flower that in the world doth grow, Whose whitenes doth surpasse the driuen snow. Her gentle words more sweete then hony are, Her eyes for clearnes dimmes the brightest star. O were her heart so kind as she is faire, No lady might with my true love compare. A thousand greifes for her I haue sustained, While her proud thoughts my humble sute disdained, And though she would my hart with torments kill, Yet would I honour, serue, and loue her still. Blest be the place where she doth like to live: Blest be the light that doth her comfort give: And blessed be all creatures farre and neare, That yeeld reliefe unto my Lady deare. Neuer may sorrow enter where she is, Neuer may she contented comfort misse, Neuer may she my proffered loue for sake, But my good will in thankfull sort to take. [Of Craft and Crafts-men more and lesse] Of Craft and Crafts-men more and lesse, The Gentle Craft I must commend: Whose deeds declare their faithfulnesse, And hearty loue unto their freind: The Gentle Craft in midst of strife, Yeelds comfort to a carefull life. A Prince by Birth I am indeed, The which for Love forsooke this Land: And when I was in extreme need, I tooke the Gentle Craft in hand, And by the Gentle Craft alone, Long time I liu'd, being still unknowne, Spending my dayes in sweet content, With many a pleasant sugred Song: Sitting in pleasures complement, Whilst we recorded Louers wrong: And while the Gentle Craft we us'd, True Love by vs was not abus'd. Our shooes we sowed with merry notes, And by our mirth expell'd all mone: Like Nightingales, from whose sweet throats. Most pleasant tunes are nightly blowne; The Gentle Craft is fittest then, For poore distressed Gentlemen. Their minds doe mount in courtesie, And they disdaine a niggards feast: Their bodies are for Chivalrie, All cowardnesse they doe detest. For Sword and Sheild, for Bow and Shaft, No man can staine the Gentle Craft. Yea sundry Princes sore distrest, Shall seeke for succour by this Trade: Whereby their greifes shall be redrest, Of foes they shall not be afraid. And many men of fame likewise, Shall from the Gentle Craft arise. If we want money ouer night, Ere next day noone, God will it send, Thus may we keepe our selves upright, And be no churle vnto our freind: Thus doe we live where pleasure springs, In our conceit like petty Kings. Our hearts with care we may not kill, Mans life surpasseth worldly wealth, Content surpasseth riches still, And fie one knaves that live by stealth: This Trade therefore both great and small, The Gentle Craft shall ever call. [My freinds, I pray you list to me] My freinds, I pray you list to me, And marke what S. Hughs bones shall be. First a Drawer and a Dresser, two Wedges, a more &amp; a lesser: A pretty blocke three inches high, in fashion sqared like a Die, Which shall be called by proper name, a Heele blocke, the very same. A Hand-leather and a Thumb-leather likewise, to pull out shoo-threed we must despise; The Needle and the Thimble, shal not be left alone The Pincers and the pricking Aule and the rubbing Stone. The Aule steele and Tackes, the Sow-haires beside, The Stirrop holding fast, while we sowe the Cow-hide, The whetstone, the stopping sticke, and the Paring knife: All this doth belong, to a Journeymans life. Our Apron is the Shrine, to wrap these bones in: Thus shrowd we Saint Hugh in gentle Lambes skinne. [Would God that it were Holiday] Would God that it were Holiday, hey dery downe downe dery: That with my love I might goe play, with woe my heart is weary: My whole delight is in her sight, would God I had her company, her company, Hey dery downe, downe a downe. My Love is fine, my Love is faire, Hey dery downe, downe dery: No maid with her may well compare, in Kent or Canterbury; From me my Love shall never move, would God I had her company, her company, Hey dery downe, downe a downe. To see her laugh, to see her smile, hey dery downe, downe dery: Doth all my sorrowes cleane beguile, and make my heartfull merry; No griefe doth grow where she doth goe, would God I had her company, &amp;c. Hey dery downe, downe a downe. When I doe meet her on the greene, hey dery downe, downe dery: Me thinkes she lookes like beauties Queene, which makes my heart full merry; Then I her greet with kisses sweet, would God I had her company, &amp;c. Hey dery downe, downe a downe. My love comes not of churlish kinde, hey dery downe downe dery; But beares a gentle courteous minde, Which makes my heart full merry, She is not coy, she is my joy, would God I had her company, &amp;c. Hey dery downe downe adowne. Till Sunday come, farewell my deare, hey dery downe downe dery. When we doe meet, weele have good cheare, and then I will be merry: If thou love me, I will love thee, and still delight thy company, thy company, Hey dery downe downe adowne. [Among the joyes on earth, though little joy there be] Among the joyes on earth, though little joy there be, hey downe downe adowne, fine is the silken twist, Among the married sort most comfort I doe see: hey downe downe adowne, beleeve it they that list. He that is a married man, hath beauty to embrace, Hey downe downe adowne, and therefore mickle woe: He liveth in delight, and is in happy case, Hey downe downe adowne, in faith we thinke not so. His wife doth dresse his meate, with every thing most meet, Hey downe downe adowne, faire women love good cheare: And when he comes to bed, she gives him kisses sweet, Hey downe downe adowne, for thankes he payes full deare. A hundred honey sweets, he hath when that is done, hey downe downe adowne, the truth is seldome knowne, He hath in a little time a daughter or a sonne, hey downe downe adowne, God grant they be his owne. A wife is evermore, both faithfull, true and just, hey downe downe adowne, 'tis more than you doe know: Her husband may be sure, in her to put his trust, hey downe downe adowne, most are deceived so. While he doth ride abroad, she lookes unto his house, hey downe downe adowne, the finest cloth is torne: And when he comes, she gives him brawne and sowse, hey downe downe adowne, and oftentimes the horne. The Shoomakers Song on Crispianus night. Two Princely brethren once there, were, Right Sonnes unto a King. Whose father tyrant Maximus to cruell death did bring: Crispianus one was call'd, the eldest of the two; Crispine was the others name, which well had learned to wooe, These brethren then were after faine, from fathers house to flie: Because their foes to spoile their lives in privy waite did lie: Into a kinde Shoomakers house, they suddenly stept in; And there to learne the Gentle Craft, did presently begin. And five yeeres space they lived so, with great content of minde; So that the Tyrant could not tell; whereas he should them finde: Though every day to Court they came, with Shooes for Ladies feet; They were not knowne by their attire, they us'd themselves so meet, At length unto the furious warres was Crispianus prest; Whereas his knightly prowesse then he tried above the rest: But Crispine found him better sport, would I had Crispine beene; The Kings faire daughter lov'd him well, as it was after seene. The length of this faire Ladies foot, so well did Crispine know, That none but he could please her mind, the certaine truth is so: Came he by night or else by day, he was most welcome still; With kisses sweet she did him pay, and thankes for his good will, So oft these Lovers twaine did meete, by day and eke by night: That at the last the Lady said, she should be shamed quite; What was the matter tell me true, that so her sorrow bred? Her Shoomaker most daintily had got her Maidenhead. But he at length so wisely wrought, as doth the Story tell: Her fathers right good will he got, and every thing was well. And Crispianus came againe from warres victoriously: Then Shoomakers made Holiday, and therefore so will I. And now for Crispianus sake, this wine I drinke to thee, And he that doth this marke mistake, and will not now pledge me: He is not Crispianus friend; nor worthy well I wot, To have a Lady to his Love, as Crispine he hath got.
