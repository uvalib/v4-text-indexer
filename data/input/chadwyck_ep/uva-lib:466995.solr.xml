      <field name="fulltext">“The night of time far surpasseth the day; and who knows when was the equinox?”—Sir T. Browne.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE YEAR OF THE WORLD. PART FIRST. THE GOLDEN AGE. Instinctive Life. The descent into Consciousness, and the separation of the active Understanding from the transcendent faculty that dwells only in the light of the Spirit. I. Some depth unknown, some inner life unlived, Some thirst unslaked, some hunger which no food Gathered from earthly thorn or by the knife In gory shambles stricken can allay,— Man hopes for or endeavors against hope: Still hath endeavored; by the law of life Looking still on; still toiling for some rest Passing the understanding. This great faith Who hath not felt? Who hath not in an hour Of august consciousness beheld descend Around him (as the exile on the rock Of Patmos) this Jerusalem, although night Shut round him as before, and the cold moon Passed over the horizon of his soul? And ye past centuries! since the infant-god, The child-man hath kept count of these his thoughts— Which of ye hath not heard the loud acclaim,— Seen the palm leaves spread some Redeemer's path Leading the way to peace? For ever on The hope, the toil is borne, and the great torch Transmitted burns more bright from every tomb. Some good there is man strives for. This long strife Through darkness, and in mythos, and in faith, And in the aggrandizement of self, and in The weary work of knowledge—shows itself, Varying yet the same—not pausing, save To gather strength or garner in the past; Or turning like the gleaner—not despairing But in the fear of loss, and oftentimes Trembling with revelation, but too blind To learn the many-sided Simpleness So closely round him, hath the symbol risen To be the god, and mystery been enshrined— Domes built with art more perfect than the creed, Garnished with marble truth, and altars red With living sacrifice, and rites prescribed, On days divine, vestments and light of lamps, Choral rejoicings, censers through whose pores Issue fine odours, old age ministering Darkly before a visible sign—that thus The pain of doubt be felt no more—that thus We may hold fast the good, draw angels down, And walk in the cool shades with God in Eden. And thus the Hierarch of the Phantasy This shattered image of the soul reforms By sensuous tools—and man adores himself— But everlasting fate holds all; and time Scatters the chaff as doth the winnowing fan After the wearied flail. Not this, not this! Each age repeats, productive not the less; Exploring still the more; till half the world Finds wisdom in negation—and a truth That there is no truth—ending like the search Of Ceres in the Eleusinian verse, Who passed with skirt succint through many lands And over many seas with numerous tears And prayers for her fair daughter, whom she found After her mournful tears and prayers no more Able to rise to Enna and the sun. Nathless the great idea reigneth still; The tendency hath neither swerve nor stay; In all things we behold objective selves, Part of us yet against us, and within Kingliness yet unsceptred, and by night Pillars of fire! II. In the unknown awakening of the morn, When the red light was in the east, (if east There was, from whence the first day-dawn arose,) And the true forms of gods lived everywhere, Whose shadows yet some mortal minds discern From time to time; in this fair year, within An island now unknown, the tree of life Beside the home of the Unseen did grow; A boy, Lyremmos, fed upon its fruits, A maiden, Mneme, lived within that home— Then time was not, nor was there any past, Nor any distance, for the infinite leaves Of that great tree were over all the heaven; And depths were on each side, and yet no depths, For spirits filled them all. Before that boy Three visible forms advance, a vanward three Of endless throngs that until now had been Unseen by him. One from the sea, and one Exhaled as from the earth, and from above Another came: and lo! he trembled—then Stricken as by a terror he fell back, And an unspeakable change on all those spirits Drew them back from him, downward and still back Sinking and fading, as the dew of even Sinks down into the herbs with dusk and cold. Upon a couch of shining leaves, the nest Of many lovely snakes, the man-boy lay, Silent and motionless and without breath: It might be centuries, it might be throbs Of the sun's pulse I know not, but the eye Of Brama opened only through the lapse Of a thousand years. His luminous limbs gave light Around him over all the leaves, and throngs Of insects none have ever seen since then Approached about his hair; still moved he not But gazed right upward, as a dead man's eye Looks and yet sees not. In this trance he knew Cycles of ages with their phantoms pass Out of him, as if he had been all these. “Are they, or are they not? those spirits that come Answering to no voice, those snakes, and I, Am I, or am I not?” he asked, with pauses Of silence, underneath those ample leaves That now were shrinking. Then the sky expanded With many clouds, and rays of white sunshine, And he was many—not one naked youth But many, each adorned with various tires, Not all in equal beauty yet all fair, And on good offices intent, attended By beasts and all that had the gift of life— Such offices as the spirits erst fulfilled Whom now he saw not—and his sister Mneme Was beside each in every act—not one But now a thousand sisters, yet unchanged By any new adornment, in all place And act, beside himself with like intent To his; but soon her utter perfectness Seemed to remove her from his sphere. In time, Proceeding as the stars proceed at eve, More visions were evolved, and from a land Of white flowers, soft and noiseless-footed beings Floated with rhythmic motion, more and more Towards him, then with both hands each one raised Her yard-long hair, and lo, the eyes of women, The light upon the passionate face of joy— The bosom warm of mundane love! From thence He took no note of aught as heretofore, A unity in multitude; but now The term of his cognizance was twofold, The motive and the act; the outward nay, The inward affirmation—He, the gifted; She, the true answering beauty— III. Pause awhile In this grave argument (as poets term The tenor of their tales) till between thee, Reader, and I the writer, some few words Be said. In truth I look up from my page, And smile—no smile of self complacency, For not with steel on stone, by hieroglyphs Shadowed, nor with cithera sung, nor spoken With apostolic singleness as of old, This shadowing of the most august first time— This speculation of the course of ages— Is fashioned; but with watchful care of words The artist now compiles; and with the steps Of analytic consciousness he goes— Backward and forward goes the theorist, Upon his Seerath-bridge: and round him men Whose time is parcelled into hours, (the clock, The town-clock, at this instant you may hear Telling the lapse exact of this day's transit,) Scarce steady themselves an instant without price, Bent constantly on short dates and per cents. And I would not be quite apart from such; They bear the latest social form, and Change Acts through them nobly, and conventions thicken Net-like so thick, that it may be, ere long, We can no further be removed from nature. But more—about this room from whence I see The innumerable snow-flakes wandering down Upon the sapless boughs and turfless ground,— Are many books, three thousand years of books; Elora, Mount Sinai, and the Porch, Are printed there, and wordy condensations Making eclectic garments for quick thinkers: And poets, eyes of time, observers only; And of all these the earliest still the best. Nor are those walls of other histories void, Things sacred from the hand of art are here, Penates from the Nile, Pompeian pictures, Masks—that of Homer, and of the Redeemer Traced from an altar magnified by pilgrims. And in this presence touch I pen and pencil— And in this presence dare I theorize Even of the infinite and the real! Friend reader, is the north wind cold? bring coals Unto the sinking embers till new flames Crackle and leap; in this we are agreed, Yesterday's fires no second heats exhale. Is not the Past all gone, and code or myth Treatise or history that now remain Are but the chambers whence the Spirits passed Into the world of Deeds, through which to work In infinite mutation to the present: As circles on the water still expand When the dead stone that caused them lies below. I speak not of the poet; wisdom even Is like a giant's garment borne but once; As was the cross of Jesus, after whom Who followeth bears a cross but not like his; Not more like his than did the labourers Whom crowned Saint Helen guided in their search Till they exhumed the holy wood? Was not The impulse vital from which those wise works Proceeded; went it not abroad then, searching Into the roots of action?—thought no more, But action—antiquating the embalméd word Which was its voice at first. Woe unto him Who sees not this, alas for him that thwarts it! IV. “Lyremmos, where Hidden or wandering art thou? I have sought Throughout thy haunts and found thee not in any. Answer, Lyremmos! the calm sea is blue, And from the porch gleams dismal cold, and dark; The kind sunbeams shoot no more through the stems Of the living woods, nor any one of all The turtles thronging them with sleepy voices Keeps the still evening wakeful.”—“Mark that star, Sister, it is a lovely thing, and well May I have lingered watching its increase. I have had clouds about me—Thoughts, strange thoughts; I know not what they were, and call them thoughts: I never singled out one star before, But looked upon them all unheedingly. I have been far away with throbbing pulses, And terrible joy, and almost utter absorption;— Art thou assuredly my sister still, After those ages and those changes all—? When first I laid me here, and on that roof Of the great leafage of the tree of life I fixed my eye, the upper light made shine Their veinéd green like fire. At first that star Was scarcely brighter than the heaven around, And as the near grew darker, it, the distant, Peered eminently out. My sister! thou Hast been a guardian to me—from the first Birth of my memory thou art to me As that star still increasing in delight Is to the sky—oh, far more governing! And now endeavor I to confess to thee, Since I have known none other counsellor,— For those fair spirits who were wont to throng About us were but servants, and within Our central home, our shrine, I cannot ask. Am I not now a conscious God, yet mad; A snake, but without instinct; a mere question, With ever-bursting heart, and must remain so Until I re-arrange those tumults, powers— External to me, yet reciprocal, To which I am subjected, yet free born.” —‘Brother! we have been happy 'till this hour, Happy as all around us; be thou still A boy!” she cried, and shaded back his hair To look into his eyes, and held his hand Up to her neck, and bent her pliant form Down to him even 'till her breast met his. “Be still a boy!” she said as they lay still, Her yellow sandal by his foot, her arm With its slim bracelet lifting up his hand, His eye upon the heaven, and hers on his. And thus replied he. “Would it might be so! But 'tis a foolish wish, though thou art old To my mere youth. 'Tis happiness I seek, But it must be a happiness secure, Enjoyed because I know it for my own— That whate'er is should be. Now tell me why, Maternal Sister, tell me why this garb—” And lo! he had the insignia of Osiris Upon his head, upon his loins, and arms! “There is some strange deformity abroad From this our home, and I, who midst these sweets Have swam till now, can reconcile it not; Nor will! But nature whilst I slept has borne Me up to manhood, and I wake to search For what was constant in my heart before.” “Be still a boy!” she tremulously breathed, Scarce heard by him, although her brow was pressed Upon his neck. While thus they lay, the voice Of some bird sheltered in the dark arose, Rose clear and loud—then silent was for ever. V. They passed into the temple, and with soft Brow-kisses parted, as if all had been Past and dispelled, a transient influence From twilight and the depths of wolfish woods. But he looked out again upon the sea Sounding alone. A life like that in sleep Flowed throughout all: a change had fallen on him! He pondered,—thought upon his thoughts! Alas, He saw not where the waves of this new sea Pursued their unseen tides: if onward still Wave followed wave beyond the sea bird's flight, Or where from its cave loosed, the salt-weed floats, Darkling for ever: or if some high land Might slope its pearly strand unto his keel, Where rainbow-hued, like our retreating storms, Beautiful things might live, beside the courts Of Vesper's slumber and the Moon's repose. What place in this new world will her smile cheer? Sweet Sister Mneme! shall she be with him Wherever he may be? so thought he, with A fond remorse that he had ever willed To leave her. Thou wilt be a spirit throughout The air he breathes: thou wilt sit on the prow And smile on him while his hand guides the helm Through the revulsion of the cloven waves. Thy song will blend with his, if happily He finds a paradise, a sheltered nook From that new pain, that glimpse of knowledge now Streaking his silvery happiness with blood. No sound of feet was on the awful floor Of the interior of the shrine, all dark That shrine which cannot be described or known. A tripod-lamp stood there: behold a light,— An arrow head of flame, sprang up from thence, Scarce strong enough to make the slim shaft seen, And a fair hand that hovered over it With animating oil. The fair hand bears The tripod through the darkness. Mneme bends Upon the curtained steps, and with her hands On the flower-hidden feet beseechingly Up to the mighty Goodness smiles, and speaks. “Spirit supreme of all! To whom all turn with re-inspired acclaim And eyes refreshed; apart from whom our life Wanes into the inane, thou who art here Sheltered among the darknesses of birth, Yet vivid now before me with white light Looking into my wishes. Thou whose breath Made vital all the air of this wide world, From thenceforth musical with bird in spring, And beast, and insect in the drowse of even, And the young gods who guide the change of days, And lover's songs with stringed art less rich, Wandering in child-like beauty of their own. Before whose advent there were none of these, But moanings passed along the yeast of waves, Where cumberous death rolled sightless through the dense And slimy waste. Ideal power! whose form Is here before mine eyes in living truth,— Evermore varying with infinite changes As hopes or fears prevail in this poor heart; Thou who inspiredst the creative hand Of nature, (may I not irreverently Speak such great verity?)—whom I have served From everlasting, and thereby have lived Here where Uranus' children come, all clothed With the ineffable light of trusting worship, And wonderful voices that declare all things, Without articulate words of hymn or prayer: Round whom they circling dance mysteriously, With chaplets on their arms, and ministering doves, That enter white-winged through thy shrine at will,— Light on thine altars—or with thirsting bills Break the clear waters that refresh thy flowers,— Spirit! oh, fold him in thy starry robe Again, and make him thine and mine unchanged, (Although he cannot understand me now,) As he hath been! hide from him the new shore He longs for; hide the hopes, the fears, of which I nothing know but that they are not thine.” She ceased: her brother knelt upon the step Beneath: he held her hand with both his own, And won her earnest gaze to his own face Which by his gloomy hair was almost hidden. “Weave me a tunic, sister, through black storm, If need be, I may wear; a sandal firm Fashion for me, that may keep whole these feet For many a stadium of travel; yea, Through burning soil or shell-strewn deeps. Alas! Mneme, my sister, henceforth wilt thou be A memory alone, for thou can'st not.— And this deep shrine, doth it not blind me now, I have grown callous to the power thou feel'st— The perfectness of silence, the profound— Those beautiful great limbs, are they not stone— Marble, and fire, and gold—I see them not— They are withdrawn, sister! where art thou! still, I see the dark trees, and the stars, the sea, All things without the porch—but nought within— The winds arise, the shadows of lions pass, A voice is in the air, and from beneath A sound of thunder comes. I am alone.” PART SECOND. THE JOURNEY. The retirement of the pure faculty into the Sanctuary. The workman begins his work. The workman sleeps. The Doctrine of contemplative Absorption. I. How like to ours the ancient tale of Psyche! Happy in her enrichéd palace, stored With pleasant sights, and sounds, and dainty fare, By day; and Love himself her guest by night; Until she longed to know him, and the lamp Held to his sleeping face,—from thence no more Her guest; and she an outcast from that hour. Alike yet different. For the feminine Was not then sanctioned by the great advent Which Gabriel announced with bended knee And sceptre of white lilies unto Mary: She the appointed medium between God Descending and the man redeemed. Nor then The sufferer had been deemed divine—the Moral Come into light! the Moral which will lead us Out of the realm of pain. Such change again May be, and future fables hold the man More perfect; when the Strong and Just shall be One Will, as force was virtue in old times. Meanwhile I make the Energy the error, Masculine power, a birth and death power only. Upon the sand strewn with sea-baubles, she, Mneme, the sister of the wanderer, stands. The chill breeze beats upon her sorrowing breast And bares her lustrous limbs: the alternate wave Enamoured of her trembling feet heaps up The snowy foam around them. Thus she stood, Nor ever turned she from that cheerless sea Her eye so placid, yet so earnest-sad: She follows him upon the nether shore, Among opposing boughs of swarthy forests, And broken bones of a degraded world, Stony ravines and rocks, and obscure life. “Would that he could have understood me! would That he had read upon my yearning face Those things which must be felt, or be unknown; Which words articulate may not convey! Alas! new wonders are before him, all The changes of the sea's green countenance, The solitude of winds and hills, the moaning Of waves in hollow caves and deep dank lairs Between the jaws and gorges of the dark. With these he strives—and walled by those obstructions Doth he forget this heart that beats for him, And these soft arms that cradled him so oft, And these lips fading now that kissed his sleep In the dove-shelter of our living groves. Lave me, my handmaids! from your pebbly home Come up, with freshening salutation come; Ye sparkle round my feet, while I am faint, And all my immortality decays Into a fleeting breath, while demon forms Stand in the path of the adventurous child Of fire from heaven, and fabricated mortals— Dædaléan things with life but seeming— Invite him to be one of them—to rush Downwards into the seething toils of change. Ye spirits who delight In crowded sisterhood beneath the stir Of the great waves, upon your ambient hair Reclined, in close embracement of curved limbs: Ye who delight to gather shells and pearls, And cast them on the sands with gleaming heads Through the white tide-foam. Ye whom I behold By the red peak or morning mountain sides, Flying aslant with feet to feet among The sun-fringed clouds, upon whose dance the rainbow Its azure and its violet doth shed. And ye who ever sit i' the boles of woods Deafened with moss;—where even the aspen-boughs Waver not in the still air:—couched in leaves, With eyes fixed all day on some sapling stem Strengthening in spring time. Ye whose lucid limbs Sleep in the quiet fountain undisturbed, Save by a veering leaf from shadowy tree Alighting with faint circle by the reeds. Minister to me that I wane away Not altogether:—be around Him still, To bear his memory back to this warm breast. “Wonderful that he left this land of light And peace to be a ruler in a world Whose happiness is pain, whose beauty and joy Are tears and wounds; my eye-lids droop in fear Before the passing vision that reveals A constant interchange of sentient death. “Lonely I turn, oh spirits meek, to you All our great mother's ministers of love: As a thin shade evanishing away, As music hovering o'er a drowsy ear I lean on your immortal breasts!” They heard,— The beautiful things of nature heard her moan, And buoyed her up reclining on their arms. The countless spirits from the shrine she served Flocked down upon the sward without a sound; The blue flowers shone like children's trusting eyes From the green turf, and undulating snakes With glistening skins come round her; while the waves Whose constant alternations fill the shells As if in sport, a silver moaning made, That sank with infinite quiet to her heart: And the gay breeze thoughout the thornless groves Seeking to win its way to every nook, Whispered such music as the Dryads love, When the strong sun upon their heavy hair Sheds gold, and deep repose, and indolent dreams. “Fear not, fair priestess, whose kind wonderment Hath followed far the wanderer grievingly, Fear not but yet this Eden breeze will lift His mantle hurrying towards his natal home. Fear not that Storm and Strife have power so strong That he may never disentwine their woof, Or that the lank lips and the muffled brow Of Meditation gloomily bowed down In starless funeral crypt, can fascinate His heart: or that she may his willing hands Clasp in her own for ever: he will stoop And gaze into her face, and disenchant The evil power, and she will die away, And her home open to his franchised steps That has no bourne but here. Fear not that he Who tasted the cool berries of these trees Will ever lose his immortality. Enter—we are around thee, perfect one, The sisters of the waves their emerald cells Strew with strange beauty that thou mays't repose Among them: the brown daughters of the woods Smooth their mazed brakes that thy fine foot may fall Pleasantly: and the oozing fountain drops,— Drops placidly from its cold cave, where oft The lizard venomless with guiding tail Crosses from rim to rim, and lilies float With snowy cup full spread. Thou shalt live on Amidst the endless trance of day and night;— The evening star will pass into the morn, And the sun's chariot verge towards the south And back due eastward; trees shall shed their leaves, The birds their feathers, and the prancing deer His antlers: but no other change shall press Upon thy peace. No Dædaléan seeming Of Life and Good; no ruling men in mail, Or burden bearing, or loud-tongued complaint, Or love spasmodic, or desires forbidden, Or dying murmurs of regretful pains, Shall penetrate into thy hidden home.” II. Man hath begun his journey: farewell rest, And light, and harmony and beauty, all Spontaneous or instinctive sense, farewell. No retrograde, no turning the tired foot Even for respite or repose, a force Of infinite impulsion drives him on; No looking back along the path he clears As he advances, for the wings of clouds Close after him. No silence, for the boughs Are rent, and with his giant arms the rocks Are broken and removed, and mammoth beasts Howl at him from afar. He builds himself A throne—he passes on, and in that throne A shadow of himself remains, a form Like a phosphoric mist amid the blackness. Whose limbs are chained as if an agony Had fixed them in that coil for evermore, And in whose hand a flaming torch appears To which the stars are weak. With shouts of joy At each new light, man raises as he goes Torches and fires, strange light and warmth exhaling, Through which cloud, rock, and beast with gleaming eyes, Shrink terror stricken. Now another throne He rears, another demigod is crowned,— The mighty hunter! whose unerring arm Holds the death-loaded reed, and his clear eye Looks from a smooth brow—while the herded wolves, And panthers, and the lion, fly in vain: A shout exulting doth the laborer send Along the world, and round his loins the skin Of the striped tiger now behold, and on His feet the wild bull's hide. Again I hear Acclaim, a mixed acclaim, and to his rest The pastoral patriarch ascends—the plain Spreads out, a vast expanse girt in by hills; Obedient flocks and herds are gathered here, Obedient birds frequent. Upon the grass The shepherd's crook is seen. Upon the earth The sower's wallet—Evoe! the wheat sheaves! Io! oh joy, the vine with trained stems Fills the great vat with wine. Close following him A form heroic and yet matronly Gathers her woven skirts, and round her head Draws the fair woven hood, as in the gloom Of antique mythos she becomes enthroned: The distaff holds she and the twirling spindle, Comfort with blessings rife. Again the line Of thrones which will encompass yet the world Receives another reared of molten brass. And he who now ascends those brazen steps, Is he not Tubal Cain, beyond all honor, Father of Crafts, and conqueror of toils? The armed wanderer quickens in his speed, The laborer works now easily, advancing As if with wingéd speed. Anon he looks Upon his blackened limbs, and in the stream Laving, resumes his travail more composed. Again the line of giants is increased, The sweet inaugural hymn prolongs even yet Through these millenniums of past history Its happy echoes; for this spirit holds A stringéd shell, and with exhaustless words Evolves the sense of nature, and reforms The solid world, that man and woman sees The paradise they long for, the true vision Of the interior heart of all things. Ha! What dubious giant follows this, the loved one? Light flames around him, but the form is dark, And terrible his lidless eyes look out As when he slew the dragon and its teeth Sowed in the furrowed ground, to bear a crop Of strife unending: or as when he taught The record of the past its permanence Upon the graven tablet and the scroll. Who next appears? Another lovely and beloved, behold! The perfect shall be with us from henceforth— And the deformed, debased, shall not alone Environ life, the beautiful appears Answering the Idea, plastic will Grasps at the Symbol. In unfading youth He leans upon the pillar of his shrine, The brown hair falls around his neck, the brow Warm as a living mortal's, and the style Hangs in his subtle hand. They fade behind me in their state: and still Others arise more potent and august, A human god aye adding to the past. But yet the wanderer in his fitful joys Stood still despondingly, for endless seemed The struggle, and much evil everywhere. It is indeed a generous joy to feel The impress of myself on outward things. But why this doubt, this palpitation strange? Where am I, and whence came I in this guise,— E'er I dispelled the boyhood of the heart? Is there indeed a less conditional joy? Is there indeed a fixed truth?—do I dream Of what I hope until the dream becomes Confused with memory,—do I hope until The fable of my hopes becomes like truth? Dim memories of faded cycles these— Or nought, perhaps, but the unfilled desire; The longings of the soul that feels its power Superior to the dull oft-trodden round Leading again unto the starting point: The refuge of the heart when life's frail lamp Glimmers beneath the troublous glooms of care, And Fancy's wing alone remains untired. The vision dies away like the sound of waves Borne on the distant winds, then swells again Clearly and beautifully amidst all The tongues of multitudes in dissonant clang— Or tyrant-patriarchs toiling with their slaves;— Or horrid war, hands trenchant on the life!— Above the riot of the wine-inspired, Throughout all melody and words and forms— Over the noise of labor and disease, Above all voice of passion, on my soul A reminiscent conscience often steals. III. Here stood he still, the Ganges ebbed and flowed Up to his feet, and as he gazed, the river,— The river and the air articulate thoughts Uttered thus to him. “Give reverence, O man, to mystery, Keep your soul patient, and with closed eye hear. Know that the Good is in all things, the whole Being by him pervaded and upheld. He is the will, the thwarting circumstance, The two opposing forces equal both— Birth, Death, are one. Think not the Lotus flower Or tulip is more honored than the grass, The bindwind, or the thistle. He who kneels To Cama, kneeleth unto me; the maid Who sings to Ganga sings to me; I am Wisdom unto the wise, and cunning lore Unto the subtle. He who knows his soul, And from thence looketh unto mine; who sees All underneath the moon regardlessly, Living on silent, as a shaded lamp Burns with steady flame:—he sure shall find me— He findeth wisdom, greatness, happiness. “Know, further, the Great One delighteth not In him who works, and strives, and is against The nature of the present. Not the less Am I the gladness of the conqueror— And the despair of impotence that fails. I am the ultimate, the tendency Of all things to their nature, which is mine. Put round thee garments of rich softness, hang Fine gold about thine ancles, hands, and ears, Set the rich ruby and rare diamond Upon thy brow.—I made them, I also Made them be sought by thee; thou lack'st them not? Then throw them whence they came, and leave with them The wish to be aught else than nature forms. “Know that the great Good in the age called First, Beheld a world of mortals, 'mong whom none Enquired for Truth, because no falsehood was: Nature was truth: man held whate'er he wished: No will was thwarted, and no deed was termed, Good, Evil. In much wisdom is much grief. He who increases knowledge sorrow also Takes with it, till he rises unto me, Knowing that I am in all, still the same: Knowing that I am Peace in the contented. I, Great, revealed unto the Seer, how man Had wandered, and he gave a name and form To my communings and he called it Veda. To him who understands it is great gain— Who understandeth not, to him the Sign And ritual is authority and guide A living and expiring confidence.” The voice ceased, and the laborer strove no more. Songs swoon amidst the roses of Cashmere, India's dark-browed daughters as they weave The leaves of marigolds with pinky hands, Hymn their own Cama. Scarcely may his ear Note the rich sound—and scarce his eyes perceive. A deep and lasting slumber falls on him: He spreads his limbs so wondrous in their grace Upon the lulled shore for a lasting sleep. The sun sinks down and wakes again to breathe Vigor into the year: he slumbers on: His regular breathing evermore exhales Into the air, but his wild eye is closed, And his arm listless drops upon the sand Whose shelled things crawl around it in the cold. PART THIRD. THE JOURNEY RENEWED. The Labors of Man advance, and become multiform. The going forth of multitudes into historic nations. The Doctrine of Self-elevation. I. And sleeps he still, the Man melodious-tongued, He, born of harmony in heaven's depths And primal light—Lyremmos, sleeps he still Like the young god upon the lotus leaf, Floating in silence through a waveless calm? Or like a child who hath no hurt nor grief, Nestling between the breasts of its great mother? No sleep was his like that, for evil airs Brought dreams continuous over him, a flock Endless, and shadowing with their unbound skirts The sunlight and the moon. And he arose With open eye that saw not, still constrained To do as heretofore he had done: then, Stood still in perilous wakefulness and fear, Shuddering as if he stood upon the edge Of an annihilation, lest that speech Which issued from the Ganges might gain strength Over him. But it could not be: “Ah, Ha!” He cried anon, “is not the power whose voice Uttered these words, himself the furthest off From this unconscious heaven! or shall my strife And labor have an end without a goal, An end without acquirement, a mere sleep? “Be this my trust, that it is not in vain From step to step I have emerged thus far, That not in vain those questions rise within— From whence? and whither? for what end am I? That this soul-travail is not all in vain, That all is well, and that the Will to rise Shall be creative of the power, shall cause The wing to shoot that I may reascend Through sign and sphere unto my native home. But where is home? I know not, but must know— And I am wandering for it now, have wandered Long as I can remember, still anon, Raising a loud rejoicing as I meet Some glimmering sign, or hear some demon-voice Muttering in the night.” II. So he passed on: Westward or northward, which I may not say, Or southward, for not one Lyremmos now But many seem to travel: some in gloom, Some fierce as maniacs; one, the stateliest form, Passes to Egypt, yet how changed is he! His step hath lost the buoyancy of hope,— He seems to doubt the firmness of the earth;— Uncertainty his quick eye hath subdued,— Disgust and apathy have swollen his lips;— Fierceness and tenderness extreme have blent Around him,—and he goes forth yet to bear, And search, and suffer, and enjoy, and weep, And laugh, and slumber evermore, between The gusts of his midsummer-day of life. His hair alone remains unchanged and bright, Like clouds through which the sun sheds red and gold. Heavy upon his shoulders bent and browned It falls, as by the Euphrates and Nile Those whispering demons cluster round his path, Feeding his dizzy ear with fabulous lore. 1. “We hold the wondrous records that embalm This youngling world. Sprang it not forth, a birth Of rending flames and sunless waves, that rolled Without a shore? We sing of Gods—of God— Of that time when the triple-spirit woke, A time beyond time, spirit beyond Gods. The eye of the great snake, is it not seen By the enlightened? The primordial shell Of the slow mover, bears it not the small-eyed, Upon whose head this crowning world doth rest?” 2. “We have with mystic chisel in the depths Of hollow mountains symbolled truths on stone, Revealed by Crishna and the darkest Hermes, Ere Typhon made men slaves of sin. Behold! Ten thousand steps go down to these great caves, Steps unseen, save by those whose hand we hold. Descend to wisdom and forgotten lore! The iron gates, the brazen and the golden, Open we now. The hieroglyphs reveal we When the great oath and curse have been imposed. Our hands have formed—shall we not understand The horned and the hundred-handed, bright With incorruptible device of painting, Processions infinite, and death-boats filled By nether species, and winged runners armed With lion's claws, those statues multiform, Whose eyelids have not closed upon the dark, Nor their ears slumbered in the silentness, Throughout a thousand years of chance and change In the sun's light, whom Spring hath not approached, Save as a drop from the incumbent world Of vegetation oozing. Are not all Instinct with fire, with vital truth replete? And wilt thou not explore?” 3. “We are the guides! With rings, and cups, and potions that revive The everlasting in the weak and dark, Breaking the grave-sleep; to our ears, through force Of terrible ordeals made to hear,— Minister gods and spirits, by sweet fires, Circles, and charms, evoked. Now firmly hold This key red-heated, this green serpent bind Around thy temples—hear ye not the sounds Of voices everywhere, all beasts, all trees, Streams, hills, declaring unto thee?” 4. “We hear! We will instruct! Look upward, and not down: Passions disperse and visible things despise: The multitudes of hands of laboring castes Obedient, make a way into the clouds. We shall ascend to stars, and on the path Imperial of the zodiac be no more Controlled, but the controllers strong become. Ether's recesses entering by our fire, With zonéd deities o'er the corporal heaven Consorting, and beholding the great Sire. For all live by one fire, and by one light All see, although the father, having formed The Earth, consigned it to the second mind, Which men, mistaken, call the soul and First.” 5. “Come with us—we are the elected ones, And we will lead thee: raise the altar, slay The spotless beast, pour out the oils, and wave In aromatic smoke the sacrifice. Is there not magic, and oracular cries Of demons—natural magic, to drive back Pestilence, blight; theurgic to command The evil and the good: so mayest thou know The infinite secret. Come with us alone, Is not the truth in nature, and the curse Is it not in the bone;—for science can Exorcise Death with arcane rites, and knowledge Of constellated planets. Joyful are we! For knowledge doth exempt us from all toils. Yet are the laborers and the princes ours As instruments of civilizing might: Nailing strong boughs to stem the unknown seas; Penetrating into the northern ice, Conquering every force by land or sea, Traversing every wilderness, exploring Cavern, snowy peak, and forest endless, Where live chimeras on the verge of chaos. Do we not know, and is not knowledge life— Shall we not fashion temples for new gods. Gods of our own whose thrones Lyremmos reared In his hard strife with mundance obstacles. And adding to ourselves new luxuries, Make rainbow-light with art upon the walls, And odorous airs obey us, we shall live In melody and song and mirth disrobed, And an accumulated luxury, Walled in with marble statues, woven flowers, Laurel, nepenthé, and the clouds of incense, Couched on the golden and gemmed height, shall power Stretch out his sceptre, and the trembling slave Stand between him and pain, care, toil, or age, For are not kings the sons of gods—themselves Beloved by Gods and by the priests revered?” III. So muttered the good demons, good yet wrong— Good—for ambition is the thirst for better, And in an untried waste all paths explores; Wrong—for a part is not the whole—nor sense The avenue of spirit and of truth, Nor happiness a conquest. But anon The earth was overwhelmed with towers and shrines, Various as insects, numerous as the stars, Terrible as the soul of man. Behold! Is it not still the same, a spectacle Of wonder to the gods who visit us From time to time, and who as yet have been Only additions to these phantasies. Good yet wrong—for sense remains the same, Nor can man e'er be free but by the spirit,— The Reason working by the Will, a will Involuntary as the acts of Nature. This Will with co-existent force, a creed Lends to the mind,—men call it Faith: the soul Meanwhile, within its sanctuary void, Remaining silent. Reader! it may be Thy law of life to live by knowledge only; And what cannot be known precisely, is not At all to thee. If so, there are few words Beyond experience for thee, and few truths Beyond the outward. All that may not bear This test thou callest mystical and vain. I too would fain have knowledge for my guide, In every day a common life to lead, Conforming to the mould of time. But not Utterly thus confined, I would revere All language of the spirit, and announce A mighty sphere, in which the Known revolves Narrowly circumscribed; the mystical Being the throes and longings of the soul To realize this sphere to its own Present. And, Reader! is not this thy faith likewise? Some church or chapel hast thou not, with prayers; Which, though thou may'st suppose thy reasoning reaches, Yet leads thee inward to the Infinite? Moreover, if this form which thou dost hold Is unto thee the only form of life— I also am thy brother, not by bond Of sympathy, but being fixed like thee. For hitherto my nature hath advanced Steadily to a peaceful faith. And so, (Because each man his own soul must redeem— And only for those ready to receive I write, whose eyes could speak to mine) at once, I pray thee lay the book upon the shelf. This mystical, oh! is it not the food Of hope which makes all nature glad; the gift Of stars which recompenses us for night. And fable is the garb which to our eyes Makes visible the spiritual subtilties; And poetry is the harmonious voice Of thought and feeling, moving so together That words acquire the bridal sound of song. IV. A noise ascends into the firmament From the broad world; the noise of many feet Passing continually to and fro; Of many hands employed with helpful tools; Of many tongues directing, or in prayer To be directed. Also is there heard Much joy, though mostly in the young; much mirth, Though often fevered; and the bounteous year Continually changing, scatters flowers, Nurturing secret smiles; and yet withal Is there not pain and many sighs and groans From overladen and exhausted hearts? For not to them the due sun rises fair, Or providential Ceres plenty brings, Or life is angel visited, or by gods Pervaded with ecstatic influences. Their brows have sunk above the lustreless Pale eyes; untwisted is the genial curve Of lip, where horrent the stark teeth appear. Dreadful to tell, the beaten back is scarred, The limbs are shrunken, and they must obey. Over the desert north they swarm amain, Fleeing before the elder and the tyrant,— Adventuring with untired prows through storms,— Courage still waving her inspiring arm In the dark van—encamping in the waste With claim of novel sov'reignties and wants. What madness seizes him, what strife he bears Everywhere with him, and devouring thirst To have, and have alone unshared. I lack! I lack! continually groaning cries The man, and in this want creates new cares. The glittering bands advance, with knife and bow Guarded; old men with gold upon their breasts, And soddened eyes, and withered ears, give gold,— Give and receive,—bartering slaves, the young, The well-beloved of nature; men unbent, Save by the curse in Eden uttered; women With unawakened hearts. How many tears Must fall e'er resignation can embalm The arid spirit, and how many pains Distort the limbs till sense forsakes. I see Humility and love by their long hair Dragged on the ground, and the sweet voice become Jabbering frenzy: for that power is cruel Which cannot make, but only can command. Within his cedern walls and veils, secure That the wind flares not his myrrhed tripod-light, The powerful, with dark visage, on his couch Leans, listening to the travail of the storm; And with vile vows of offered hecatombs, For force still ministers with fear, he prays! And evermore the weary are released By death regenerating; Death, the king Unhonored, arbiter of man with nature. In mountain and in valley doth the priest Resign him to the soil; the waves also Claim their just share; the north-wind rends the sail. Fair sea-nymphs! ye have seen him in your caves Abhorred fall. What shouts, what clang of arms, What gathering of multitudes all armed,— Much is there which cannot be borne, and much, Children of men, not thus to be destroyed! Kings crowned advance on crownéd Kings, with gleam Of purple housings and mailed giants. Now They meet with stunning clang and sound of trump, Trampling of horse, and fire. Knee strained to knee, And eye to eye with basilisk destruction, The thirsting iron spills the wine of life; Eyes darken in the blood-bath,—over them New foes contending meet, and forward, still Hurtling towards this whirlwind, young and old, Smitten with madness, rush. The trumpet's cry Continues still throughout the shrieking streets— Over the palaces and pyramids. Woman and sphynx and priest are ghastly pale Behind the brazen gates; but on the wall The mailed are thronging—from without ascend Exultingly a thousand climbers. Down! The crushing stones descend, and arrowy shower! The alien athletæ sink; yet more Succeed with straining engines. Ha! what flames Lash round them! gates expand—the sword completes The work with flight and triumph and still death. High prows are veering round unto the waves Shrouded in smoke, while clapping of glad hands Sounds on all paths, and round about each shrine The multitude of dancers sing for joy. Lyremmos! have these whispering dreams all fled, That wolfish yells now reach thine ears alone; Hast thou resigned all hope, all memory lost Of primal peace and thy great aspiration? By Sinai wandering long, what caravan Escaped from the Egyptian, fed by heaven, And guided by a kingly patriarch, rests? Unto those eyes the wonders of the God Have been revealed; unto those hands consigned The written law with thunder and through fire. Is this the wanderer still, from land to land Passing untired? With ephod, and the sound Of bells about his skirts, within the veil He enters, and the past in parable Is unto him revealed,—the pure repose Of Eden—the declension and the toil: Thy toil, Lyremmos, and thy future joy— Conqueror through Divinity descending. Appears he yet again upon the deck Of ships on Adrian and on Ægean waves, Whose prores are painted with Egyptian eyes,— Fair in eternal youth he doth appear, Although with pride debased and wilful force,— Upon his potent arm an ægis hangs, Molten with conclave gods; upon his head The Phrygian tire with stars; and on his brow, Great as a lion's, calmness, and the joy Supreme and sweet of arts and flowing numbers. The dark green waves rejoice around his helm, And Tritons herald him with shell and shout, And gambollings grotesque with supple nymphs. The shores to which he sails with love awake And claim their lordly bridegroom, everywhere Vocal with sweetest verse, oracular With nature deified; and genial shrines Men dedicate to man, with hands inspired, Appear. Among the isles, by Carian strands, Within Etrurian towns, fair gods are born From human attributes,—Strength, with his club; Beauty and earthly Love are there; and Force, With bloody arms; and Art, with hammer clanging. And Wisdom robed, and Manhood over heaven Guiding the sun, and Womanhood the moon, Partially understood, but very fair; Ceres the bountiful, and reverend Pan, Lover of silence and of music. Now He stoops into the Eleusinian shades, Beautiful fables of Arcadian years About his heart. The arcane comedy Fills him with gladness, like a pleasant dream. From the bright flowers of Enna's meads she sinks,— Proserpine sinks with Pluto; she looks back, But she hath tasted, and she must abide What change the mixéd potion shall perform; Until emerging she beholds again Her mother Ceres and autumnal plains. “I've taken from the Cista's sacred verge Things arcane: into the Calathus formed For terrene fruits I've flung them. Hence again I must retake them.” Thus he doth repeat, And trembles as he feels that of his search This might be hieroglyphic. The great sage Of Samos speaks to him revivingly. “Revere the gods immortal, first fo all; Next thine own verity; the Oath revere: Revere the heroes: to terrestrial demons Render the natural worship: to thy sire And to thy mother honor give likewise, And love unto thy friend with constancy. “These things are well: and next for fleshly ills. Much, I beseech thee, much command, for life Is nourished through those appetites which cry Give, give! continually, and would fain Be themselves rulers and not ministers. Nor eating, nor reposing, nor in wrath, Nor in desire, be more nor less than just; For shame is raised by these 'twixt us and heaven, And good becomes reversed, no more with light Descending, but exhaling from beneath. For is not man the temple and the god At once? So reverence thyself, O man, Above all things. “The body and the soul Are two; the active mind between them reigns. Observe the right in action and in word; Beware of Custom, reason evermore Still turning to this truth, that fortune's wares Are mobile as the withering leaves of trees— Value them not: patience! and persevere Without them; fate is wise unto the good, And all men die—yea, death is ever near. Strange theorems, beware of them; give place; Be not seduced; by understanding act; By reasoning believe; deliberate: In all things mediocrity is best. When night descends, and to the couch comes sleep Softly on tiptoe, let her not, until With forehead on thy hand thou scrutinize The past day, good or ill, but hour by hour, If ill, determine, and if good rejoice. These ways are true, they are divine; I swear By Him who made the Soul, and planted there The fixed idea of the universe. “Of spirit: pray to God; by use of prayer Thou wilt approach Divinity, and know The constitution both of gods and men. Men shut their eyes and go astray; the good Is nearest, but they see it not, alas! Erring, still erring. Zeus, father-power! Deliver us, or show us our own souls. Courage, my brethren! are we not divine? All sacred nature's holiest mysteries To us are given, and when life's coil is wound, Transformed the wise shall verily be gods.” PART FOURTH. THE JOURNEY CONTINUES. The Advent. Pantheism gives place to Unity; the worship of the Comparative Best to the Doctrine of Divine Love. The Song of the Moral. Modern life. I. So spake the wise. Upon Athenian streets Each man his ample tunic wore, confined By golden clasp, self-satisfied and built In the proud arrogance of kingliest rights; While the large cubs beside the Tyber nursed, Strengthened into ungovernable wolves. Everywhere gods—but gods like men—and men Aspiring to be gods, Lyremmos saw,— Saw, and was wildered by the depths of things; For is it not the partial truth that swims Beneath, or gilds the surface of all creeds, Laws, arts, which fights against the absolute truth? Truth, and not error, is our enemy— A relative and half-seen truth, which seems Perfect, because the flower of its own age,— Because it is more fair than all the past, And burns against the blackness of the future. White tunics, brazen arms, and cinctured brows, In charioteered array, are thronging past. Oxen, milk white and filleted with flowers, Follow the small bright axes of the priests. Thickens the hum in the dense theatre,— The rushing wheels are heard, and rival steeds Pawing the crimson dust—both gods and men Pause, breathless; crownéd heads bend o'er the poles, And shake the impetuous lash. The sinewy-armed Leap into the arena, and contend With measured grasp and sudden artifice; A stately nation deifies the victor, And an imperious poetry uplifts Her wondrous torch, and on the poet's brow The evergreen of honorable fame Alights, and he, too, is a god: behold, The incense is before him, and its breath Intoxicating floats around his throne. The Teian lyre at intervals is heard, And to its call the fair-limbed dancers throng. The sweet pipe wanders through its high discourse, Tongued softly,—now a louder measure stirs The languid blood, like quivering lightning: hushed At once, as the choragus strikes the ground, Silence leads in the terrors of the scene, With its grand argument of fate and death, Heroic passions, mortal demigods. Everywhere shines the sun on marble shrines, Everywhere on the emblems of the gods. Oh, fairest work that yet the soul and hand Jointly have realized, advancing even Up to the speechless presence of the perfect; Even to the Idea by which power Is one with rest: the casual and the false, And the express annulled! With golden staff And crimson mantle stands the honored sculptor. A sense of change creeps through the earth like spring; Another change; the Journey lies still on, And the refreshéd traveller from the Porch, Whither with hope and joy he had repaired, Hurries to meet the birth of coming years. The giant of the Tyber towards all shores Thrusts his insatiate spear; no more the waste Harbours chimeras, or a ridge of hills Bounds the known world. Is not the strongest king? The sword interrogates, nor waits reply, But ruthlessly affirms his right with blood. Isis appears in Rome, and Roman gods Share with Osiris Alexandria's fanes,— Adonis is forgot by Syrian maids With annual outgoings and lamentings sweet,— The voice from Delphi's cavern faltering fails,— Mithras bewails th' unfrequent sacrifice, As magi gaze upon propitious stars, And with mute confidence await their Lord; The Hebrew groans beneath the iron hand Of the sword-bearer, and prophetic shrieks, With gnostic mysticism by the gates Of Solomon, have long been heard: all eyes Wait for the advent of the Holy One. Who shall describe Him, the new conqueror, The promised one of old? With greater force Opposing force, shall he with sound of trump Be a triumphant swordsman? Shall he come Learnéd and wise, a sage among the sage, Illumining the great profound. He comes! “Great Pan is dead,” the pilot hears becalmed; “Great Pan is dead,” he hears repeated thrice On the wide sea, as if it were the moon Uttering to the deep this mystery. Crumble all temples, and expire all flames Hitherto ever burning on the shrines: Let the white smoke upon all altars cease; Free ye the filleted heifer and the lamb! A youth sits singing on a fair flower-field, Of marvellous beauty and of strength unknown. Naked as at his birth, save that his neck, His ancles, and his wrists, bore many strings Of diamond and of amber, and his hair Fell black unto his loins, with fragrant oil Anointed. Through this hair his gracious eyes Looked lovingly around upon all things; Albeit the long eyelash seemed to lend An indolence, and threaten hasty night To each emotion, and his parted lips Wavered between a sorrow and a joy, As if surprise was their continual guest. Upon the green earth, thick with flowers, he sat: But chief of all these flowers narcissus grew, And by the Nile, which kissed that flowery mead, The lotus. With a subtle active hand Wrought he in red clay from the caverned ground, Small lares and penates infinite In symbols and device, and as he wrought, Orphic rhapsodies to the earth sang he, And the sweet tale of Psyche lately taught By the great sage. So sat he and so sang, While the world went rejoicing through the heaven, And the sun passed from sign to sign, and they, The Man, the Woman, and the Child, appeared, Pilgrims from Bethlehem. On an ass sat she, And in her arms the child; her innocent hair Drawn smoothly back beneath a dark blue hood, Her meek eyes resting on her child's head: He, The God and man at once, and yet a child, Clad in a white shirt with a hem of gold; Over his head a circle in the air, An orbit as it seemed of subtlest lightning, And holding in his hand a golden ball, Looked with calm eyes right forth unto the youth Singing beneath the curtain of his hair Hymns to the earth, and carving symbol-gods. While yet far off the influence of those eyes So penetrated him — he stayed his work. The old man led the ass straight on, intent As it would seem on nought but harborage At fitting hour at eve, but it stood still. Throwing his wild head back, the vehement youth And the calm child converséd, eye with eye. “Who passes through this land from pyramid To pyramid; from the gray distant east, By lotus-bearing waters, to the west Gray distant; from the golden gate of birth, Where the sphynx watches, to the ebon doors Where likewise sits she, though with closed eyelids. Who can so journey by my flowery field, Seeing me, whom mortal vision worships, Without a votive or a suppliant sign,— Belongeth he to water, or to air,— Is he a brother? yet I know him not.”— “Brother, in sooth,” replied the child, “in sooth A brother, come to help thee. From all time I have been coming; from the Infinite I have been coming, and behold me now Passing with tears into the Infinite. Thy eyes are not as my eyes, yet behold Thou understandest me, and seest the light That burns around my head.”—“I see thee fair, But not the fairness of our mighty mother See I in thee; I feel thou art much love, Yet art thou not the quiver-bearing god With whom I fly into Elysium oft: Still art thou great, for I, the Vigorous, Before thy humble presence hold my breath; But how canst thou be feared,—a nurse-borne child,— An ass,—an old man? I am strong; these arms Strong against all that live; am rich in shrines Numberless; rich in arts, albeit live Like the wild bee; but in thy nerveless arms I see no ægis, no caduceus, staff, Sceptre, nor club.”—“Thou sayest well; I know That thou art strong as life, that never fails, But is reborn of death; that thou art strong Against the wind and wave and all that is: Strong am I, also, as that life that flows Outward from all minds, inward from all things, To death unknown; strong not against but with. For love most surely makes the mightiest serve With sweet consent of soul, but not with bonds. And for the signs of rule that thou hast named, Are they not each peculiar to some act Of force or knowledge all unfit for me? But in their place behold this cross-crowned ball, Sign of supremacy on earth; a sign Thou knowest not, of sorrow dominant.”— “Such speech is Typhon's: speakest thou of love, Yet rulest thou by suffering? saidst thou not, Thou wert my brother,—mine,—the singer ever Of varied hymns unto the procreant earth From whom I sprang, from whom sprang gods and men, Who ordereth power, from whom flows happiness; Who giveth laws to wisdom, by which laws The souls of men ascend, becoming gods?”— “I am thy brother, not alone of earth, Which is as nothing, but because of spirit: Spirit alike in all, for of himself Man is but evil, and all men the same. The universal Spirit I adore, In Him I live, nor are there any gods Save Him. The earth is manifold, but he Is one; the mind of man hath many joys, And of these joys the gods are fancied wards; But there is one thing needful, one alone, Which is to know the truth that all can learn, And to have faith therein:—so that all joy, All sorrow, learning, power, will be but seeming.”— “Of Demogorgon I have heard, the spirit; Com'st thou from him? if so, pass on thy way, For I can never see his terrible sphere, But shrink with fear extreme even at his name. Pass on, dread child, who sing'st of unity: In multitude I live with constant change, With beauty everywhere, deformity Everywhere also, and the ideal poised In still recurring orbit overhead— Many ideals, many orbits, lo! I fashion them in pliant clay. And oft An ear reluctant have I given to those Who speak of Demogorgon, but no joy Have they yet added to mine own. First came An obscure utterance from the east, a voice From the great Ganges, saying,—Energy, Why livest thou so bold in good and ill, In pain and pleasure; hold thyself retired; Deny, be still, within the cause perceive The action and result: content thyself Without them; they are transient, turn thyself Into the permanent within? I tried With many pains, and with obliviousness, Nor found I permanence. Then many came; Voices from Egypt; voices from the schools Hear I even now, in which rejoice I much, Yet fear I more—for speak they not of spirit? Pass on, dread child, who sing'st of unity.”— “Pass I not on, for I have come to thee; And this is what I bear from the great God, Who made the creature man, to whom I speak. That not by learning shall he reascend Into the primal quiet of his being, But as a little child he must become: That not by sensuous pleasure shall he step Within the circle of his happiness, But as a virgin, with simplicity Shielding her round and round, he must become. Not by the rule of sceptre shall he gain Nearer to sov'reignty, but by the heart Shall he find rest in life; for happiness Is an outgoing sympathy, and he Who giveth most receiveth most: yea, He Who giveth life receiveth life eternal. Even for this cause came I into the world.” The youth turned down his supplicating eyes Unto the earth, as if to ask for help. No answer did the earth return; those strange And cunning figures that his hand had made Melted away, the likeness of a cross Remaining only; on his knees the youth Bent humbly to the child with clasped hands. II. The traveller urges on again, refreshed, Exalted, and yet humbled. Now at last The heaven, his birthright, was revealed to him, And in the dreams of his fond memory That female form upon the Syrian ass Seemed to have soothed him in his infancy. But what obstruction meets him, and what pain; For that redeeming advent brought no peace. Yet travelled he with strenuous desire, Kissing the broken-hearted, lifting up The fallen; uttering thus his hopefulness: “All now are brethren, and all sisters now! Pan is not dead, but from the outer world, Where he made worshipful the elements And concourses of nature, to the heart Of our humanity he hath come down: Which beats now in clear harmony with heaven, Harmony universal. Oh, good spirit! Now childhood hath been glorified, henceforth Respected as the perfect yet the helpless. And manhood for the false shall strive no more, But yield himself unto humility: And womanhood shall walk with reverence And honor, until this sweet hour unknown: For sanctity existed but with fear When man, the strong-armed, worshipped but himself. And I rejoice that I have found at last The treasure I have sought so blindly long, The law of love divine, which reconciles The world of careful pain with happy heaven. Oft have I turned my face with weariness From the proud passages of priests and kings,— My ear from the discourses of the wise, With arrogant eyes upraised as if they saw Their own apotheosis in the clouds.— Now the white lily at each gate shall grow, And meekness as a handmaid wait within. A revelation shall descend on all, Answering prayer, and all the world rejoice. Blessed are ye, my brethren, who are poor; Blessed are the unlearnéd, unto whom Our Father can more freely enter in: Blessed the merciful, for they shall have Mercy,—the earnest after righteousness, For surely they shall find it. Free the slave From villain bonds, and let the greatest serve! Oft have I listened to the sage, who deemed His logic reached unto the verge of things, Out-through the terrene and the spiritual world, Who yet saw nought, but his own eloquent arms Waved in the dusk air; neither could he hear, Save his own tongue responsive to blind dream. He shall no more be reverenced by men. The great apostles have gone forth to teach; Love, Zeal. and Perseverance be the names Of the three best belovéd by their Lord— They have gone forth to teach, and unto death Shall they fulfil their mission, and all lands Resign the sword, the sceptre, and the chain.” So with a radiant face, the faithful one Who hath not tired nor ever hath despaired, Rejoicéd he had known the blameless man, Rejoicéd in the region of the moral! And saw the cross from man to man sent on, From woman to woman given with grateful tears And kisses, saintly kisses. Ah, my God! That it had ever been as it was then. From Church to Church the sign transmitted spreads, Till all the coasts of the mid-terrene sea Sing praises to Messiah: through the ice Of the Sarmatian winter—through the storms And mists to Thule is the soft hymn heard. III. Whence is this novel doctrine, spiritual theme Of strange equality, renouncing state, Order, subordination, war, and gain? Who is the king they place above us all, So honoring his speech beyond our edicts? Bring him forth, those who follow him bring forth— That they may die, and so our power, whom Jove Doth make to rule on earth may firm remain. Do they not hold by him whose shameful end Was prayed for by his tribe; do they not hold That sacred Delphi is a demon-voice, That all the gods are demons or mere dreams? Atheists are they not, unheard-of men, Who are as beasts, whom reason cannot reach? Bring them before us, that by their just death The pure theocracy be sacred held. Citizens! what impiety appears Amongst us, knocking even at our doors, Unveiling women, drinking children's blood! Shall we have games and festivals no more? Triumphs no more, nor arts, nor capitols, Nor golden tissue for the weavers' trade? All learning and all knowledge,—shall they cease, And we stand naked to barbarians' swords? The people's voice hath said that they must die. Such were the loud responses to those hymns, Heard with sweet concords through the under paths Of social life; and such the fierce reply To the love-prompted utterers of the word. They died, but perished not. Above all pain, By which antagonism strives for power, Those sweet concords increased: with changing words Increaséd they; alas! with changeful words: With words which are the mortal vestments thought Appears in at the altar of the mind,— Thought, the immortal and untangible, The ruler of the act;—with changeful words Those sweet concords increased upon the ear, And left the heart as barren as before. Too simple for the learning of the past, Too unadorned to reign above the senses, Too naked for the buskined pride of youth, Which then was this world's epoch; gnostic lore Came with its theologic fantasy, Building hierarchies, and seven heavens With their degrees of beatific joys, And a like mystic number of dark hells. Initiatory sacrament and sign Drew the hushed flocks together in the night. Missives of shepherds become canons holy: The shepherds tribute-gifted, and their crooks Gem-crusted gold! Away unto the waste, In sackcloth with a girdle of horsehair, Flies the ascetic from the growing honors; No sandal and no linen and no food,— He trusts unto the hand that bird and beast Feeds ever. In high places shines the cross, The sign that aided the imperial arms— Strangest of aids!—upon the battle field. In highest places, and on altars girt With princes, and in councils:—for the priests Have this most wondrous duty, to sift out The God's word from the scribe's word. Shall we not Be one in faith? Yea, he who otherwise Than that believes—pursue him from the fold, Unto Gehenna: never more let men Reason on that, for it shall not be changed. And thus the modern world grew up to flower: One God, one bishop, and one creed — one man To rule—let every state have its own king: A hierarchy in heaven, and in the church A hierarchy; another in the state. The outstretched basis of this pyramid, A feudal serfdom cleaving to the soil, Yet reaching freely up from class to class, For all souls are the same with God, all powers His instruments. The Idea everywhere— Of God, of man, of nature, of creation— Without which there is no rest for the worker, No aim towards which to work—this general scheme By revelation fixed: the modern mind Concentrated within the narrow sphere Of Understanding, Science substitutes For Reasoning, and beneath the wings of Faith Sits in the school of Knowledge patiently; Investigates, explores, even to the core And centre of the sensuous, to the depth Where soul and sense unite; till step by step He shall come out into another sphere, From Faith and Knowledge equally removed— Evolve the resurrection of the real, And be at last the master! PART FIFTH. THE FUTURE. The modern mind working under the authority of Revelation, discovers science. A true Beginning found at last. The near future. The distant future. I. Thus hath Lyremmos, from the ante-past, Which words in this degenerated life Cannot reveal,—descended through the strife Of consciousness and forces from without, Of good and evil, disobedient both,— Descended to the prison-house of sense To be a laborer. We have traced him far, Toiling from out the dark; from land to land, Mythus to mythus, age to age, his steps Advance upon us, gathering as he goes Spiritual dominion; as the child Becomes the man, the green stalk shoots to flower, The constellated year from iron frost Melts into white-flowered spring and rosy morn Of summer, thence to autumn, even now, Science, the gleaner, brings into our hands Earnest of harvest. But the Holy Child— How fared he? As the laborer overjoyed, Carried the tidings to Sarmatian wastes, And through Norwegian forests, where swart dwarves Forge arms for maniac warriors. Overhead Odin doth summon to the feast of death. The chant of the invincible fierce jarls,— The dying warrior's song as his blood flows,— Hears the commissioned traveller, hears with joy; For there too is the fixedness of faith, The indestructible: no idle game, Nor indolence with ghastly logic mumbling, Nor old authority with eyeless fables Living in lack of better: and his voice Pierced like a charm, prophetic of the power In future years to come from this cold north, Sea-kings of industry and princely men Ministering between nature and her God. Here stayed he, and along his fruitful path, Cast back a glance of triumph. Wo is me! Peace there was none, force more than ever reigned, Force strangely standing in defence of Truth, The naked yet inviolable essence. And now rejoice we over all those years, Rational instincts springing constantly Into the young heart of a world revived, Rousing a wild impatience time alone Could recompense. And more beheld he strange,— That reflex Christ Arabia hath received, That energy abortive, in a time Of vital energy. The Holy Child, Who came with tears to give the blind their sight, Where now was he? With longing infinite The brotherhood of men desired the light Of his dear countenance, and turned with prayer Unto the triple-crowned, his delegate, Crying that he might be revealed to them. But barren save in feudal pride, the priest Sitting on cloth of gold, that in his pomp His master might be honored, with rebukes Answered them, and mere words, anathemas! Cords, flames of death, more urgent questioners, Receive in answer, 'till the heaven grows black, And providence becomes like evil fate. Sadly unto another world, the eyes Are turned: the poet, fancy-led no more Coldly invents, but retributive hate And sorrow are the muses after whom He follows to the shades, or into heaven. Oh, plaintive even in joy, what sacred grief With the hard-handed arts of those days dwells! Severe and weary, and yet sanctified By innocent faith, they stood still in the way That time continually clears. Anon, The under-working mind, with knowledge armed, Answered the question that mankind had asked Of the thrice-crowned: and doubters with strong lungs Rise to do battle with the lawgiver, Each one establishing his positive law, Half argument, half faith, from age to age Changing and to be changed: upon the strand Of future centuries to leave the bones Of extinct churches, when the Holy Child Shall be in truth made manifest. But in Those years of gloom, not less to king than priest, Did the impatient voice of suffering cry: Not less but more; for the monarchic arm, Held up by law and by the right divine,— How much authoritative words have done,— Was as it were the representative Of all possession; and the popular voice, Even when chivalry with barbed heel Rode over naked vassals, rose to kings, And to the privileged phalanx with allegiance, And lusty admiration.—Let us not Call up the tyrannies of truncheoned hands, Nor name them in a song for future years; For sand they have been sown upon the wind, And sometimes hath the serf-born energy Exacted retribution, though but small; Moreover, through them hath come down to us What yet there is alive in passive souls, Looking like Faith, but which shall certainly Give place and disappear as better comes; For ever when the fruit is ripe it falls: And over them hath grown the power of gold, A mightier convention, that hath sent Sea-kings around the world; untiring prows, Leaving no cavern or creek for wonder; No darkness unexplored, nor soil untilled, But with her handmaid, Knowledge, levelling, Weighing, building; with much politic speech Loquacious, and with science infinite, Torturing the inanimate to serve; While all the cycles of the past, dissolved In vulgar truths, became as thin as dreams! Thus breathless on the verge of the abyss, The nigh to-morrow, stand we in the cold; Rejoicing in our freedom from the past Increasing constantly, and in our power Over the lower world so rapidly Increasing, very proud: at last, at last, After much stumbling, and much aspiration,— Much grasping at the stars amidst the dark,— Theories of spirit without basis,— Theories of death and reasonless creeds— Reasoning where mere knowledge should be guide,— Seeking knowledge in the sphere of reason,— Corrosive cogitations manifold— Which the uncounted multitudes of men Heard not, pursued in cloistered solitude By few; a true beginning we approach— A true earth have we found, whereon to build The temple of the Real; where to plant The ladder of ascent, which step by step Shall guide us from the prison. But as yet Man's mighty labor lies around him piecemeal: Much done but more remains, before the tree Now planted bears; before the marble steps Now planned shall lead into a worthy home; Before the capitals now carving rise, Sustaining walls whose frieze shall represent The wondrous ways of man the Perfected. II. Here I pause. Because I would not like a prophet speak! Daring with unblessed feet the burning path Of divine instinct, or with hand unblessed To touch the cherubim:— Because I would not willingly offend,— Seeing I venerate the present hour, Also the past I venerate—and because The number is but few who do not sneer At hope, the sacred angel of the future, Thus gladly violating even nature, If thereby they exhibit the astute— The vice of prudent men. And furthermore, The time that passes is too multiform, The true and false unsifted, all too close Pressing upon us, to be largely read. But certainly the spring-time comes apace, The songs of birds have certainly been heard; Also, the snake, not wholly without pain, Doth leave his old skin in the last year's dust. Let us advance in faith, by which each one In simpleness shall persevere towards The one Idea of the universe, The longing of all finite life; the Good, Which we can compass not, Which yet sustaineth us. To whom the soul points, moving either way Around its dial-sphere, by which it holds Power above the finite: whom the sense owns Visibly seen in all things round us here. All this phantasmal time Existing as his type. He who established from of old the law Of generation; movement without end, Inevitable, widening from the centre, Circling and evolving all that is, Of unity, diversity, Antagonism, life. III. FIRST CHORUS. Where is the poison and the blight, my friends, That rose with evil incense to the stars? Where the destroying worm, that in the rose Made beauty but the emblem of decay? Where the strong limbs of ravenous beasts, whose life Was by destruction nurtured? where the storm That triumphed through the air with winged clouds, And blinding lightening, under whose strong hand The mariner went down; the deadened waste Of winter, and the houseless traveller, Where are they? where the iron and the brass— The countless fabrications of all crafts, Wearing the human tools unto the dust, Raising strange wants and adventitious life, And misery made a guest in every home: All things deforming, thwarting, beneath which Humanity was an o'erlabored steer, A suffering—where are they? for no more They press upon us: who hath wrought the change? Say, friends, Oh say. ANSWERING CHORUS. Who? who but He hath wrought the change, the man, The laborer himself; for by the law Of the Infinite, change there can be none But from within,—evolved, not altered,—born, Not superadded. He who hath gone round His habitation as the sun goes round; Who hath left nought unknown, but heaven and earth Measured and analyzed,—the ways of God Everywhere finding, the entangled web Of mixed and broken forces, heretofore Antagonists, unravelling; end to end Linking the chain anew; those evil things Which bear not towards a better, going down Into the void and unimagined past. Thus hath he hushed the moaning voice of pain, The cycle of his labors thus fulfilled. He, he alone. FIRST CHORUS. The bow, the spear, the sword, the shield, That late were borne as symbols by the strong, Once more than symbols—as the echoed songs From poets of the past inform us still; Poets with burning souls and hopes of fame, Drunk with precipitate joys; the hopelessness That had no future; pride unto itself All things, in purple and in gilded pomp, Rejoicing in the bitterness of envy: All the sad tears that on the fairest face Of love so wore the furrows,—all the fear That made man, men; and each to each a friend Or foe or slave: the self-aggrandizement, And deep self sacrifice for vain command— Where are they all, those madnesses of heart? Or who hath charmed the angel peace, to come Even into the bosoms of all souls, Making our lives impassive happiness— Even immortal? ANSWERING CHORUS. From whom hath come this harmony? from him The sufferer himself, for by the law Of the Infinite, change there can be none But from within. Oh, from the earliest hour Hath it not been towards this his sufferings bore, Towards this his prayers ascended, and for this, Patience, the child of weariness, from house To house the words of comfort whispered still? Behold her wanderings ended, she becomes The angel of sweet peace for evermore. For now the mission of the Holy Child Hath been confirmed by instinct, since the curse By which the body was condemned to toil, Even unto death, hath been redeemed, and man Emerging shall be yet again divine; He hath uncrowned the passions, and transformed Earth into heaven. FIRST CHORUS. The oracle, the spectre, and the sign, Of influence mysterious; all the rites Of the anointed, and the sweet resolve Of the disconsolate to be made glad, When the full heart o'erflowed by children's graves: The strange analogies by which kind hope Embalmed mortality, the honey and myrrh, For the poor wounded life: the avenging gulf Of Hades: where are they? nor hear we now The multitude of disputants, each one, Faithless to the divinity within, Filling the ear with words by which to clothe The goddess Truth, and o'er her nakedness, Terrible in its beauty, to prevail: Filling the mind with words by which to fix The spirit, not then from vile bonds released. Melodious voices hear we now alone, Throughout the conscious air: whose tuneful tongue Hath done this, friends, oh, say? ANSWERING CHORUS. His, even his, whose words so falsely strove As ye have said—who symbol raised and sign, When better could not be; for every time Hath had its work, and relatively true Was its voice heard—yea, oft in symbol dark Was the unspeakable shadowed, and the realm Of the unlimited verity approached. He, sure it was, who slept by Ganges wave Contemplative, with fables manifold And images unshapely: he who came Successively, avatar and new god: He who, with logic's tools and Attic grace, Contended for the empire of the mind, Hence rising to the permanent: he who, In tribulation and much suffering, found In faith, that affirmation of the soul, Redemption from the uncertain, and at last Felt as he longed to be: he who sojourned So long with knowledge, that the hand and eye Resumed their ancient sovereignty o'er all, Vast regions of sensation new explored,— A consciousness interior and removed— And in divinest instinct lived at last. ALL. Awake ye echoes from the hills and woods; Awake ye murmurs from the seas and winds, Not now with tyrannous voices, but attuned And fixed in harmony with regular pause: Open the hymn unto this spiritual power By which ye are. SONG OF THE ECHOES. We are the serenities, Born coeval with the soul, But who have no life except In her love and in her smile. We are the answering ministers Of whom man speaks, through whom he thinks, By whom life manifests itself. The pebble glimmers in the stream, The fly swims round the sleeping pool, The chrysalis in the corner hangs; The fish beneath, the bird above; And we are with each one everywhere. They have wandered not, nor closed Their ears unto our guardian voice, Though blind and deaf indeed are they: While man hath left us long. But we have felt throughout our homes His sympathy again: We have heard his high commands: We have seen his gate thrown wide That we may dwell with him again: And he hath come to us. Behold! He hath been dead, but he lives again. Feed him with honey from the cups Of charméd flowers that never more He may long for poisoned food; With milk from the immortal breasts, That he may for ever live. Sisters! though we come to him In nakedness he doth not faint (As mortals wont to faint of old, If us they saw in stream or wood With our girdles thrown aside): Sisters! now he doth not faint; We can gaze into his eye, We can press our lips to his, We can sing the faintest lay Ever learned in cavern old, Or amongst the summer clouds When the hills are whispering, And he can hear, as he hears us now! LYREMMOS. Now at last I reach my home: Now again those multitudes Of beautiful forms behold. And the great leaves of life's vast tree Cover all the heaven. As a traveller at eve, I journeyed to the dusky East, But I have met the morning's light! Although the shades were dark, although The stars were dim and intermixed With vapour, and the sickly moon Was chill, as is a bleachéd corse By the salt foam of the sea; And the owl with croak obscure Greeted me upon the wold, And the beetle blindly smote me, In the darkness, on the face. Now I meet the morning light! And the circle is complete! But where is she I left of old In Eden; she whose memory Hath drawn me on; she who unseen Sends these glorious ones to greet My steps to boyhood's nooks returned: For now it seems as if my search Had been a search for her alone, Now it seems as if the while, With weary feet throughout the dark I strayed, her voice had been my guide: And that I now remember all The words and songs wherewith she strove To wake me from my fever-sleep— To guide me into this, her heaven. ECHOES. Sisterhood! let him behold Mneme; whom with sheltering arms We have clustered round so long: Lyremmos! Energy! behold The white flower, Peace, thy sister, brings: Behold her now descend, she bends Her radiant face to thine. END.</field>
