Yours to be commanded R. N. LONDONS ARTILLERIE. Induction. When the daies King, our Sommer once begun, In Leo's Inne had lodg'd his golden Sun, And had, to sport himselfe some little space, Heau'ns Dog-starre loosd, to giue the Lion chace; A Description of the late drie Summer. The eager Dogge so hotly did pursue The panting Lyon, that the breath, which flew Before his nosthrils, kindled in our aire A fire vnseene, which made the mountains bare, Sing'd vales and plaines, lickt vp the dewes sweet drops, Suckt the trees sap out at their leauy tops: Yet still the starry Curre so thirstie grew, That lakes, ponds, pooles, all plashes drie he drew; The siluer Brookes beneath their banks did shrinke, Earth gap't at heau'n with open mouth for drinke: Riuers, halfe lapt vp by his blaring tong, Scarce quencht the thirst, which his hot stomacke stong By his fierce heate, that humour hid within Our humane bodies, through the porie skin, He did attract so fast in drops of sweate, That men did faint beneath his fierie heate. And I, that shut vp in my carefull cell, His burning fury by effects could tell, Rose with the Larke, the morns cloud-climing singer, To take the aire, the hot bloods-cold breath-bringer; And on the East of that greene plot of ground, Which Londons The Artillerie yard. Campus Martius may be crownd, Where that free troope all voluntary led, Each Mars his day, the war-gods dance do tread, I from my natiue (London) walked forth Into that field of yore cald The Spittle field. Lolesworth: Where the fresh aire by winds tost to and fro, Which keepe it vncorrupt, me thought, did show That heau'ns afflictions euer purge the minde Of those, that vnto vertue are inclinde: The Larke, that left her food, her nest, her yong, And early mounting, first with her sweet song, Saluted heau'n, did seeme to bid vs win Helpe from aboue, ere our dayes worke begin; The Strawburie and sent-sweete Violet, Which abiect grew, before mine eyes did set That vnknowne worth, which oftentimes doth dwell With meanest fortunes in a homely cell: The odoriferous Rose, the gardens Queene, Bout whom an hoast of thorny prickes are seene, Said, they must suffer paine, that seeke for honor, Since hard accesse and danger wait vpon her; The bearded Corne, mongst whom the fuller Eare Did bow the head, when they that emptie were Would waue aloft, did shew that vertuous men, The more they haue, the more still humbled ben: On euery creature, natures God hath writ, Instructiue noates to teach the dullest wit. Thus walking on, by chance I cast mine eye Vpon that ancient place, shot vp on hie, Which was by worthy founders raisd of yore, To be an Hospitall of Saint Mari' Spittle. house of mercie to the poore, For whose decay, which then I did behold, Thus to my selfe, my griefe I did vnfold, Thou noble relique of that Two citiz?s of London, of whom see the Illustrations. Decay of the Hospitall. nobler man, And his deare spouse, whose bounteous hands began And finished those workes of praise in thee, Whose like these iron daies doth seldome see; Where are become those almes deeds of the dead, With which so many poore in thee were fed? Or where those lodgings now, which then each night Gaue harbour to so many a wandring wight? Do they abide? alas they all are gone, And nothing left, lesse deafer, then the stone Within thy walls, to hearken to the poore, If they to thee their wretched case deplore. O wofull state of miserable man Once dead, scarce any good or vertue can Liue after death with vs! for such the rage, And the dull blindnesse of this enuious age, That eu'n the shadow of that antique good, That wont to be, is now not vnderstood, And the good deeds themselues of those good men, Are swept away, as they had neuer ben: Alas that vipers-like, we should deuoure The liues of our deare parents, who had powre To liue a leauing name to vs vnkinde In those their workes, which they haue left behinde, Which to the like, might like true lights conduct vs; Examples more then precepts do instruct vs: But that imagination may not thinke, That euer good was there, vnto a sinke Of euill we conuert that place, which then Was the true zealous worke of vertuous men. Abuse of the same. For where the aged and the impotent, Liu'd in their actions chast and innocent, Th'vnbridled stalion, breathing furious lust, Prouokes encounters in the Paphian ioust And there, where many a true-teare dropping eye With zealous hands, once lifted vp on hie Vnto the King of heau'n by prayer, were winners Of soules saluation to repentant sinners, Now French-sicke Syrens, and lewd Circe's dwell, Whose lookes are hookes to hale hot blods to hell: O that the buds of youth, that promise much Of timely fruite to follow, by the touch Of Cankers here decaying, should despaire, Who sucking forth the verdure of their faire, Conuert the sap of their inclinde good will Into the poyson of detested ill; Or that the aged Chrone is suffred here To feed the Cockatrice, who doth appeare No sooner hatcht, but that she runs in hast To Venus schoole, where she doth learne at last, With pestilentiall lookes and banefull breath, In youth to blast poore modestie to death. To you (graue Lord) therefore, who for this yeare, Do Atlas-like vpon your shoulders beare Our Londons heau'n; the Genius of this place, By me doth beg redresse for such disgrace, Lest Englands pearle not onely beare the staine Of being blemisht; but seeme so prophane, That her concurrent enuious Rome may say, Where vertue was, now vice beares supreame sway, No sooner did my Muse, vrg'd by the wrong, Of these bad dayes, end her Satyricke song, But looking backe, behind me, I beheld One, that had all this time himselfe conceald: His garbe was Souldier-like, so was his gate; His weeds though meane, were comely: yet his state As 'tis the souldiers portion now, was poore, His lookes did say his purse had little store, And yet vpon his brow beneath his hat Temperd with mildnesse, manly sternesse sat, Denouncing peace to those, that peace allowd, And warre to those, that would be vainly prowd; Who, when within the reach of voyce he came, Saluting me, his purpose thus did frame, Good time of day, Sir, be it no offence, That bluntly I intreate you to dispence, With your owne meditations for a space, That I to you may tell the worlds disgrace To men of armes; we often by discourse Finde ease of heart; and I do reade remorse Writ in your lookes, of which my wrongs reueald May find some comfort: Humane griefes conceald, Are in great thoughts, like strong wines, that will rent The caske in peeces, if they want their vent. Alas Sir, answerd I, what comfort can Expected be from such a haplesse man, Who by the vaine worlds mockery is made Your fellow seruant vnto care? words fade, Like false friends leauing vs, and will be found As fruitlesse, to our griefes, as Musicks sound Is to the deafe mans eare, onely they feed Our humours for a time; yet after breed, As do dead bodies their owne eaters, cares, That do consume vs; yet no man despaires, That sees his equall with true patience beare The like bad fortune: for now euery where, The Muses pupils, whose profession yet, (Except where Ignorance, as Iudge is set,) Shall ne'r giue place to armes, are made the scorne And scum of time, who though thus left forlorne; Yet like the teeth, that still preparing food, Do hurt themselues to do the body good, Neglect of learning. In watchfull studies wasting out their prime And May of youth, grow old before their time, And both their health, their wealth, and wits engage With golden knowledge to enrich this age, Who strumpet-like, vnthankefull, with a scoffe, Once hauing knowne their worth, doth cast them off, Except they stoope like Panders to the time, And do partake with it in euery crime: If any noble wit, rauisht with loue, To those diuiner mysteries aboue His talent would apply, he must appeale To some Church-chaffring Chuffe, who will so deale By his Primitias, or some other meane, That the poore Liuing, will be left too leane To liue vpon; except some one disburse The Leuits portion out of his owne purse: If any sound, profound, farre-reaching sprite, Whom the deepe Politikes do most delight, Do breake his quiet sleepes to serue the State, How many tedious winters must he waite Vpon the taile of Greatnesse, and yet finde Himselfe like him, that seekes to graspe the winde, Mockt and deluded with vaine words so long, Till in olde age death consummate his wrong? (O haplesse brood of great Apolloes braine) To what shifts do these times your wits constraine? Some forc't by want to say by learnings worth, Turne Liuerie men; others, whose yonger birth But little better fortune doth affoord, Must Pedagogize at some great mans boord, And learne true Congeis of some trencher boy, Wherewith to please their Patrons painted toy: Others ill vsing their Dramatike pens To grace the Stage, and promise pleasing Sceans, With the sweete honey of their golden stile, Feed others fat, and sterue themselues the while. Thus then you see, that in the selfe same fate, Both men of arts and armes participate, Which may yeeld comfortt, since 'tis some releefe To wretched men, t'haue partners in their greefe. To this, the souldiour sighing, thus reply'd, Ay me, would God, that I in armes had dy'd, Since being poore, and therefore deemd a slaue By the times worldlings, in distresse I haue No other salue to cure my wound of care, But onely what forc't patience can prepare: For since the due of armes we are bereft, What hope of helpe, is to the souldiour left? Neglect of armes. Pride-pampring ease, secure of after harmes, Inchants the warre-God in her wanton armes, And from his helme, now hung vp by the walls, In whose darke concaue Spiders weaue their cauls, His plume is pluckt away, which euery where, Cowards and martiall men alike do were; Who in the steed of Gorget made of steele, Bout their phantastike neckes do fondly wheele That base deuice of yeallow fall and ruffe, As if the patterne of that fierie stuffe, In the true perfect colour, they would take, Which pride shall put on in the burning lake. But soft, I seeme too bitter gainst the times, And some perhaps, who patronize such crimes, Will taxe my plaints, as vtterd in despight, Out of a warre-thirst gainst the sweet delight Of blessed peace, which heau'n doth still bestow Vpon our state; but let such fondlings know, I to my countrie, wish no wounds of steele, But such, as now our fruitfull furrowes feele, Onely it grieues my soule to see th'increase And fruite of plentie, which our happie peace, Pride chiefs author of euill in our State. So long enioyd, could carefully prouide, Deuour'd and eate vp by their wanton pride, Who, like a treacherous: Peere, that bearing sway In state affaires, makes euery one giue way To his designes, fights for our foes at home, That so our selues, our selues may ouercome. Tis that (alas) that with selfe-spoyling hand Exhausts the golden treasures of our land, Wastes townes and cities, makes our people bare, Turnes rich men poore, brings poore men to despaire: It is that Omphale, that by her charmes, Makes our Herculean youth, neglecting armes, Put on the habit, lookes, lockes, pace and face, Of tender women, to their beards disgrace: It is that Harlot, who by lust at length Cuts of the lockes of our young Sampsons strength, Giuing the golden gulls of these our dayes An heart, but of an Hart, in bold assayes Fitter swift flight, then fight to vndergoe, Who for themselues do no true valour know, Sleight the poore souldiour, as debosht and base: Yet if grim-visag'd warre should shew his face, Such Fops to meanest souldiours, arm'd in steele, As vnto Gods for helpe would basely kneele: Tis not sweete peace (which is and hath bene giuen Onely to those, that are belou'd of heauen, Gainst which the vulgar vainly doth inuay) That is the cause of martiall mens decay; For since their swords do purchase peace from farre, Wise peace should keepe them still, to keepe out warre: Those lazie Lozels, that on soft downe beds, Till noone day laying their phantasticke heads Vnto the pillow, study and deuise On some quaint English, French, or Tuscan guise, Who to maintaine strange fashions, and new cuts, Do wring their poore racke-rented tenants guts; Who kindling lust at euery females eye, Fell forrests, woods, make lands and lordships flie, T'incense chast Matrons to vnchast desier, And burne their beauties vp in Paphian fier; Who greedy after gaine, turne peopled townes Vnto poore sheepe-coates, to increase their crownes, Are they, whom our long happy peace doth pricke With such luxurious plenty, that they kicke At heau'n forgot, and in such gluttonies Loath peace it selfe; yet men at armes despise; These are our kingdomes troubled seas, wherein Tost by blacke vice, waue hunteth waue of sinne, Nought casting on our coast of Brittannie, But weeds and froth of soule impietie; O, that such subiects (since vpon the throne Kings sit as lights, for vs to looke vpon) In decent habit, and right vse of things, Would imitate the glory of all kings, Our learned Soueraigne, vsing his increase With modest hand, in calme of this our peace!

A sweet rest I am. A sweet rest I am. But cease my bootlesse plaints, and let me liue Safe to mine owne thoughts, lest I hap to giue (Seeking to cure my carelesse countries crimes) Pils farre too bitter for these sinne-sicke times; I know rude souldiers are too rough to please This dainty age, the darling of soft ease; And best it is in silence to lament That euill, which our plaints cannot preuent. This said, we heard through ecchoes shrill rebound The drums dull spirit-animating sound, And volleyes of thicke shot, in thunder spending Their fiery spleene, through clouds of smoke asc?ding; At which amaz'd, the souldier startled stood As out of passions dreame, wakt with the good Of happy tidings, and with greedy eye Searching about, askt whence it was, and why; To whom, I thus: this is that The field lying on the East side of the Artillery yard. famous field, VVhich once her bosome did for buriall yeeld To Romane Victors, after that the power Of ciuill warre, which doth it selfe deuoure, Had brought the Brittaine by the fatall stroke Of Cæsars sword, beneath the Romane yoke: For here olde Rome (the worlds proud mistres) brought Her youth vp in the sleights of warre, and taught Euen in this place, the souldiers bloody game, For which they grew so farre renownd in fame, Where she hath kept in many a sacred vrne The Romane reliques, which the pile did burne In funerall flame, before those bloody dayes, That great Vespasian wore th' imperiall bayes, When his braue sonne, that heau'n-sent raging Lion Pitcht his prowd Eagles on the walls of Sion. And as the King of Prophets did foresee, There left no stone vpon a stone to bee; And since that time, vntill these later dayes, Which do neglect all monuments of prayse, Those Romane reliques here reseru'd haue beene, Though now of them no signes are to be seene: But rest, ye wronged ghosts of Romans gone, And since the fatall flood, where euery one As wearied, leaues his mortall loade at last, Ye long agoe t'Elisium plaines haue past, Let not that wrong late done, alas therefore, Vnto your graues, now grieue you any more: Englands London so cald by the Romans, of which in the 7. Canto. Augusta, our fame-farre spread citty Out of your scatterd ashes, as in pitty Of your dead memory, with her kinde hand Hath raisd a The company of the Artillery, of who see to the 2. Canto. Phœnix-like faire martiall band, Who in that field where your could graues haue ben So long conceald from knowledge of all men, Like Cadmus bone-bred broode in brâue aray, As borne in armes do march each Mars his day. To this, the souldier smiling, silence brake, And knowing not their worth, of whom he spake, Said, can soft shakes of wooll, or tennis balles, Like iron bullets, batter strongest walles? Or can the dull sword, made of lead, preuaile Like temperd steele, to pierce the iron male? Or can your cittie people tender bred, Who in the lap of ease are dayly fed, Like souldiers, who to no afflictions yeeld, Brooke the sharpe brunts of warre in bloody field? O, that those auncient Romans, vnto whom The bosome of this field did serue for tombe, Suruiu'd to see, how you this place extoll, Some Remus sure, would leape the lostie wall Of this your cittie, and would laugh to see The discipline of her Artillerie. To heare these bitter words of proud disdaine, I mou'd in minde, no longer could refraine To checke his errour; but before I spake, The earth beneath our feet began to quake, The heau'ns did thunder, and the cheerefull light Of the noone day did turne to darkesome night, At which, as we amazed stood, from farre “Ioues braine-borne Pallas, President of warre, A description of Pallas. Whom heau'ns swift whirl-windes on their wings did beare, Leapt on the earth, and shooke her lengthfull speare; A mightie shield, she bore in her left hand, Two Gorgon-like grim heads embost, did stand Vpon her breast-plate, proofe gainst dangers doubt, With curious skill engrauen all about; Beneath her helmet, horrid all with gold, Her virgin face, most goodly to behold; Betwixt the golden trammels of her haire, On either side downe flowing, did appeare As Sol, that day, when rough winds he foregoes, Twixt two hils west a ruddy count'nance showes: Her dreadfull lookes the lightnings flash resembling, She fixt on vs, and as we both stood trembling; Being almost stricken dead with feare and wonder, At last she thus brake foorth in voyce of thunder. CANTO. I. The Argument. True Discipline they doe abuse, Who for their Art, their Armes do vse. What Serpent spits his poyson of defame Gainst Engl?ds Lond?, whose illustrate name, If t'other cities we the same compare, Shines like a Phœbus to another starre? Or if to any of this Sea-sieg'd land, It, like a Cedar amongst shrubs doth stand? Or who is this, that Cur-like barking bites The good endeauour of those worthie sprites, Who by their loue to armes in martiall game, And honest arts, do honor our great name? Thou foe to vertue, on whose viperous tong, Malice hath set an edge of vniust wrong To wound their good desert, contend with me, And let vs argue on true souldierie; “The priuate man, that makes his armes, his art, No m? ought to use warre, as his art. As many do, that blindly do conuert True discipline of warre into a trade, As by the dog, that in the pond hath plaid, The water drops are shaken off on shore, When warres are husht, is lost and vsde no more; But he, that vseth armes in time of peace, Onely by practice knowledge to increase In time of warre, when cause doth so constraine, And can returne to his affaires againe, Is the true souldier of those antique times, Deprau'd with no such execrable crimes, As he, that as his function vseth warre, Who haunted with penurious want and care, Through greedy thirst of gaine growes mad with rage, And sparing neither place, nor sexe, nor age, That he in peace may liue, when warfare ends, While warre doth last, despoiles both foes and friends; For this, the faithlesse varlet, turn'd prophane, With sacrilegious hands will not refraine The sacred shrines; but with that cruell The Hyæna, a beast counterfetting the voyce of man. Plin.l. 8. c. 30 beast, That after death, doth wretched man molest, Teares vp the dead mans tombe, who did suppose The graue a house, secure from all his foes; For this the infants braines, while it doth call The mothers helpe, he dashes gainst the wall, On which it leaues, at leauing of its breath, The bloody story of its life and death; For this, with murderous blade he makes his way Into the wombe, where once the infant lay, To seeke the gold, which being before denyde, He thought the mother swallowing, there might hide; For this, to saue his life, the countrey Bore, Naked is forc't to flie from his owne store, And to th'oppressor leaues, for one dayes spoyle, What he scarce got in twenty Sommers toyle: All these, and many such, like streames of woe, As from that spring of blood and spoyle, do flowe, Which digging with their swords such men do make, That can, in time of peace, themselues betake To no vocation, but thinke others harms Their cheifest good, and count their art their armes. Thou onely Carthage. glory of that Affricke shore, Where once thou didst thy Didos death deplore, And after stoutly didst prowd Rome oppose, Lifting thy Scepter t'her Imperiall nose, Be thou a witnesse of that wofull scarre, Giuen by thine owne Matho and Spendio two rebellious Captaines. Nic. Mach. de arte bell. lib. 1. sonnes in ciuill warre, Who when they first the Romane force did feele, And brauely had repulsed steele with steele, When foes were gone, and thou hadst thy desier, Hauing no trade, to which they should retier, Did turne vpon thee, and thy sides did gore With deeper wounds, then Rome had done before: And thou, faire Italie, the hony spot Of Europes bounds, the worlds sweet garden plot, Did not these moderne dayes thy beauty staine, With the deare blood of thine owne children slaine, By thine owne souldiers, who thy peace being made, Fra. Guic. Hist. lib. 20. Except their armes, had then no other trade? O that such men, should boast themselues to be The verie life and soule of souldierie! Yet by their deeds deface the souldiers name, With rapine, theft, with beggery and shame. The Warre makes theeues, and peace hangs them vp. Tuscan Prouerbe like an Oracle Forespeakes their fate, and 'tis a miracle, If he, that in the calme of peace shall make The sword, his spade, his plough-share, forke, or rake, Twist not so many threds of shame, whose strength Shall be of power to strangle him at length; Such discontented spirits, euer like To raging waues, with all their force, do strike Against our rockes of peace, and wanting might To swallow vp the shoare, for very spight Spitting their furie forth in froathy matter, Vpon the same themselues in peeces batter; But the great Captaines of those antique dayes, Whose conqu'ring swords the Romane state did raise To that proud height, that nations farre and wide, Throughout the world, were vassailes to her pride, Bright mirrours are, in whom this age may see The perfect image of true souldierie, Who did atchieue their conquests in times past, With such swift hand, as if they had made hast In all the warres committed to their cares, To make returne vnto their owne affaires: He then, that when warres trumpet ceaseth, can Returne to his owne function, is the man Worthy to manage armes; and such were held In former times, fit souldiers for the field; Such men, like Bees make Mars his helme an hiue, Where hony-combs of rest they do contriue: So fighting, that from fighting they may cease, The end, at which good souldiers aime, is peace; And such those schollers are, that do belong T'our schoole of Mars, of whom in our next song. CANTO. II. The Argument. The practice of true Souldierie, By Londons hopefull Infantrie. The enuious Adder, hauing spent his sting, Partakes no more with any poysonous thing; But th'enuious man, when he can do no harme, An others mind with mischiefe seekes to arme. Their exercise of armes, whose worth I sing, Enuie doth seeke to wound with sharpest sting: Yet th'old worlds war-like souldiers, famous knowne, If they did now suruiue, to see their owne Practice of armes, in that free schoole maintaind, In which those hopefull sonnes of Mars are traind, Would giue that praise to them, deny'd by none To the same merit, which was once their owne, Whom (thou the Honor of this happy Ile Faire London) to succeeding times maist stile, Thy hopefull Infantry, the glittering light Of whose bright armes, in euery strangers sight, Thy name shall more illustrate and vphold, Then all thy glorious shewes of shining gold, Tis not thy wealth, which (O) too oft we know, Betrayes its owner to some treacherous foe, Which both in men of wisedome strength and wit, Masters the Master, that possesseth it, Nor height of walls, of castles or of towers, That shall defend thee against forreine powres, But thine owne sonnes, such as these, now we see Arm'd in bright walls of steele, thy walls must be: Then to this hopefull troope, thy martiall band, Great Queene of citties, stretch thy bounteous hand, And since thou art renown'd for noble arts, As farre as Titan shootes his golden darts; So cheare vp this thy chosen infantrie, Giue golden wings vnto their industrie, And hope doth promise thee as great a name In armes, as arts, from their now fligged fame; For pupils in true discipline of warre, Free, not inforc't, they all instructed are, In which they gaine more iudgement with lesse pains, Then any troope, whom strict command constraines; In all our workes a forward mind's good will Finds euer better proofe, then forced skill; And by their industrie, which brings things vnder Our powers reach, which we at first with wonder Do thinke impossible, they doe vphold That knowledge, which in perill makes men bold, Courage in danger doth from knowledge growe, And men lesse feare to do those things they know: They (as our often stroakes make hardest steele) Harden their limbes, that they may seeme to feele No weight of pondrous armes; they learne aright To keepe their rankes, and order for the fight, And vse their weapons to their foes most harmes, Which onely three do make a man of armes; Precepts decreed inuiolate should stand For martiall order in that hopefull band. The factious, turbulent, or idle spirit, Who by some other function doth not merit Of the same commonwealth, they do debarre From their societie, and alwayes are Or should be in their choyce, as circumspect As those old Romans, who did ne're select In their enrolements men, that onely chose Warre for their art, but euer cassing those; And should in discipline, before them lay “That mysterie of Romane state, which they, Whose skill in armes, no nation yet surmounted The forme and essence of a souldier counted; Which if they keepe and kicke not at command, (The life of order) in a martiall band, This brood of Mars, like liuing sparks of warre, As the small imbers, which extracted are From the dead ashes, that conceale the same, By often puffes of breath begin to flame; From light of long-neglected discipline, Late kindled by braue spirits doth so shine, That if this age, adde fewell to the same, T'will reach the cloudes vpon the wings of fame: But here perhaps, one of that roaring sect, (Who doth vsurpe a souldier-like respect, Some seeming Martialist, whose spit-like blade Hangs by his side, as th'ensigne of his trade, Whose stiffe mustachios, Porcupine-like haires, Do seeme to whisper mischiefe in his eares) Will aske, why he, or such, who, as he knowes Hath often banded bullets gainst our foes, And in the field haue sometimes had command, Excluded be from being of this band; Why rather in their place, that do apply Themselues vnto this practice, are the fry Of gallant gentrie not aduanc'd, who can And would giue count'nance to the martiall man; Thus argues he; but shall the A Citie for her defence ought in seruice to imploy her owne citizens not strangers. sheapheard yeeld The keeping of his flocke in open field Vnto the Wolfe, though he should promise faire, Or trust it to his Dogs approued care? Or shall the father of a familie, Whose life the dread of death doth terrifie, Commit his safetie to a man vnknowne, Or to a sonne, borne naturally his owne? No trust, where strife and enuie fosterd be, Strangers and natiue borne do nere agree: A cittie, at the helme of whose free state Wisedome (the childe of prouidence) doth waite, To be of powre to beate backe forreigne force, As pupils in the schoole of warre, will nourse No stranger, but her owne, more fearing men That aliens are, then her owne citizen. Great kingdomes soone decline, that do repose Their trust in strangers, as next Canto showes. CANTO. III. The Argument. States to be free from foes annoy, Their owne, not strangers should imploy. The state, that thinking to oppose all harmes, Shall foster strangers vp for vse in armes, Is like the simple bird, that sits vpon The Cuckowes bastard egges, which as her owne, She carefully doth hatch beneath her brest, By whom growne slushy, she's at length opprest; But the wise State, that danger to withstand, Doth put her strength of armes into the hand Of her owne sonnes, like the The Storke. Thessalian foule, Whose feeble strength, when age doth so controule, That she no more can forrage for her foode, Releiued is by her owne proper broode: While the graue Senate of renowned Rome, Did onely arme their natiue youth at home To guard their walles, they kept their libertie Vntoucht by prowd Cæsarean tyranny; But when Octauius sonne of purpose chose, The stout Prætorian souldier to oppose, All doubt of danger, who did ready stand Beneath the walles of Rome with swords in hand, To giue the priuiledge of state the checke, And make the Senate stoope t'Augustus becke; Then did the worlds great head, her head decline, And Cæsars cloudie frowne, did dim the shine Of her free state, Augustus selfe did feare The sway, which that Prætorian band did beare, For to that pitch at last their power rose, That Romes tribunall was at their dispose; But like the curious gallant of our dayes, Why do I wander so farre distant wayes, To seeke this errors blacke effects at Rome, When we (alas) may finde them nearer home: Looke backe vnto this kingdoms ancient heire, The noble Brittane, who with sad despaire Driuen to leaue his Northerne seate forlorne Vnto the barbarous Pict, being rent and torne With forreine wounds in Cæsars warres before, Did send for ayde vnto the German shore; To whose request, the Saxon soone did yeeld, Englands great Ancestor, a Mars in field, Whose thirst of glory in the bloody fight, And fame in armes the golden starres did smite; He vanquishing the foe, and being Lord Of many a field, did turne his conquering sword, Flesht in the Pictish blood and drunke with spoyle, To chase the Brittane from his natiue soyle; Such euer are the miseries of those, “That do in strangers strengths their trust repose: For no such faith, or valour shall be found In him, that for anothers good, is bound To meete with danger, as in him that goes For his owne fortune perill to oppose; Mercenarie men not truly valiant.The hope of pay and spoyle is that, which can Onely giue wings of courage to the man, Whom intertaind, we mercenarie call, “When pay doth faile, his faith and force doth fall: But he, whose countries care lifts vp his hands Against the common foe, bound by strict bands Of loue to parents, children, wife and friends, Not with a thought respecting those base ends Of pay, or pray for fight, goes double strong, And Lyon-like to guard his tender yong, No smart of wounds, no feare of fortune feeles, Though bloody dangers dogs him at the heeles; Happy that citie then, who at the brest Of bold Bellona in the calme of rest, Fosters such sonnes, vnto whose charge and care, She may commit her trust in time of warre, And not be forc't by frowning foes constraint, To stretch forth golden hands with sad complaint To stipendarie Captaines, and to yeeld Her forces to their conduct for the field; Since such men do preferre their stipend farre Before their good, for whom they manage warre: Th'inconstant plume in such a Chieftaines crest, That beimg but an alien to the rest, Men mercenarie vnfaithfull. Whom he conducts, shall more respect his pay, Then his owne fame or honour, waues that way, Which golden gaine with greatest gale doth blow, For this alike, respecting friend and foe; For this, that people of Gygantike breed, “The Canton'd nation, whom those mountains feed, Whose cloud-brow'd heads, do seeme aspiring high, To dare their neighbouring Alpes to scale the skie, Being stipendarie to the Millaine Prince, Did both in field themselues of faith conuince, Though much implord by him with teares of griefe, Sorrowes last arguments to vrge reliefe, And of the wretched Prince, constraind to ioyne His plate to his too little ready coyne, In part they hauing once receiu'd their pay, Did to his foes the forlorne Duke betray: O that a nation of so noble name, Should brand their worth with this one spot of blame, To set their strength to sale, and euer hold The cause most iust, if ballanced with gold; But if to such, so famous in the field For deeds of armes, we confidence might yeeld, Imployd abroad, yet garrison'd at home, What humaine prouidence could ouercome, The many dangers threatning such a state, Subiected to the hazards of debate, Which euer factiously hath fosterd ben, Twixt th'alien souldier and the cittizen; Watchfull distrust, that hath more eyes and eares Lodg'd in the heart, then be phantasticke feares, Which the worlds obiects can present without, Distracts that cittie with a double doubt; And as a goodly palme whose sappie roote Creeping through earth, doth amorously shoote Into the cristall bosome vnespyde Of some sweete brooke, that by her banke doth glide, Peares both the wanton water, which vnkinde Doth wash away the earth, and the fierce winde, That shakes her body, though they both do giue That life to it, which onely makes it liue: So such a commonwealth, that doth both nourse The alien souldier, and the proper force Of her owne citizens, both which do aime Gainst foes inuasion to defend the same, Both feeles th'oppression of the strangers pride, Which free borne spirits neuer may abide, And at that instant feares, through their constraint, The blod reuenge of her inhabitant: Such was the fate of great Iudeas Queene, That heau'n on earth, whose like was neuer seene, Ouer whose head, when in the angry skie Those airie horsemen to and fro did flie, Iosephus.When that fierce face of vengeance dreadfull stood, From heau'n denouncing famine, plague and blood, And that th'Olympian thunderer in his ire Had drawne his mightie sword and did inspire A spleene of Lions through the Roman hoast, T'auenge the blood of her deare prophets lost, Then did faire Sions forlorne daughter feele, Th'effects of trusting to defensiue steele On strangers backes, who made her channels run With the deare blood of many a slaughterd sonne And they againe in armes t'oppose the wrong Of the seditious souldier farre too strong, Did often offer in a crimson flood Their liues to death, commixt with rebels blood, Twixt whom despoyld, great Salem conquerd fell, Whom else to stoope proud Rome could not compell: That cittie then, that vseth but her owne For her defence and safetie, feareth none But her owne citizens, mongst whom, if this Or that mans baser heart shall be submisse To coward feare, yet since no people frame A commonwealth, but can defend the same, Their fainting hands in time of need denyde, By others valour will be soone supplyde; For though soft ease as Queene in any state, Their reigning long, makes men effeminate; Yet when that people armes againe shall take, Industrious practise ioyn'd with time, will make The fearefull valiant, and the feeble strong; Which to another Canto doth belong. CANTO IV. The Argument. Practice doth more then Nature can, In making vp a martiall man.

The world that brazen torment did deuise, Which like a cloud including sulphuric stuffe, Once toucht by fire with a violent puffe, Spits out a lightning from his brazen chaps, In rowling smoake and roaring thunderclaps; And with it sends on wings of his strong breath, A murdering bullet bearing certaine death To those it haps to hit, which as it flies, Doth round, round rowle, roaring aboue in skies, And like Ioues thunder, which it doth resemble, Makes earth to quake, and those that heare it tremble; O wretched man, since man it was did finde This ruthlesse murderer of humane kinde; Why did the soules inuention, which doth sit, As the chiefe master in the mint of wit, Worke without helpe of iudgement to foresee, How fatall to the world, but most to thee, O England it would proue, which at the first Ioynd with that fierce debate, which out did burst Like to a fire twixt Lancaster and Yorke, The fall of thy great fame in France did worke, “By which great Salisbury, the first of all Our English Worthies, wofully did fall, And felt those smarting wounds, while he did liue, Which after vnto vs the Gun should giue: For since that time, this torments dreadfull sound, Hath put to scorne, and in deepe silence drownd, The wonted terror of our English name, Which our death-headed arrowes, wing'd with fame, As they did flie from out our English bowes; Haue whistled through the aire to all our foes; “The Normans with their long bowes victors-like, The first vse of the long bow.At Battaile, where that battaile they did strike, With Englands Harrold, for this kingdomes crowne, Did teach vs first this lesson of renowne, Where though the English and their valiant king, As much as powre of man to passe could bring, In fight perform'd, and offring vp their breath, Did in the field not shrinke one foote from death: Yet famous Harrold striken in the braine With fatall shaft, and all his captaines slaine, The foes through so much blood obtaind the fight, That heau'n hath seldome seene so bloody sight, Which as that blazing starre before foretold, So at this day with wonder we behold “The earth there after euery little raine Weepe drops of blood for her deare sonnes their slaine, But when our English conquerd by the bow, The perfect vse of it did after know, As conquest did depend on Archerie, They made themselues the heires of victorie; How oft hath fruitfull France halfe dead with feare Losing all courage, hung the head to heare The flight of our swift fetherd arrowes, tell The danger of their fall, before they fell? How oft in field, as thunder-strooke lookt pale, To see them comming like a storme of haile, And heare her French aire sigh, as it did ake With paine of wounds, which Englands shafts did make A complaint on the neglect of Archerie. (O famous armes of our great ancestors)) The onely strength and sinewes of their warres, How are ye now neglected euery where, By those whose parents once did hold you deare? Where is your art, or whither is it gone, As if with vs it neuer had bene knowne? Alas how is it, that the wicked moath Of idle ease, and ignominious sloath, Eates vp the pinions of the gray-goose wings, And frets in twaine our shaft far-shooting strings. How is it that our London hath laid downe This worthy practise, which was once the crowne Of all her pastime, when her Robin Hood Had wont each yeare, when May did clad the wood, With lustie greene to leade his yong men out, Whose braue demeanour, oft when they did shoot, Inuited royall Princes from their courts, Into the wilde woods to behold their sports? Who thought it then a manly sight and trim, To see a youth of cleane compacted lim. Who with a comely grace, in his left hand A description of one drawing a bowe.Holding his bow, did take his stedfast stand, Setting his left leg somewhat foorth before, His arrow with his right hand nocking sure, Not stooping, nor yet standing streight vpright Then with his left hand, little 'boue his sight, Stretching his arme out, with an easie strength To draw an arrow of a yard in length: Which most praise worthie practise, since decayd Londons Opheley Sheriffe of London. Prince Arthur once againe assayd To set on foote, when many men did shew, Both strength and skill to draw the strongest bow; How in the aire, to thunder vollyes hot From murdering mouthes of late inuented shot, And how to manage strongest staues of Ash, Which first the Switzer did inuent to dash The drifts of their proud foes, and breake the force First inuention of Pike.And violent shocke of the steele-barbed horse, Since when, some few, whom c?mon good hath taught To know the good of exercise, haue sought How to renew the same; but all in vaine, Our greedy great men onely gape for gaine, Our idle youth mispending time with shame, Like boyes with beards, vse euery idle game, The idlenesse and base games of this age.And dig our Londons field-paths round about, Which children first for pins and points found out. O base condition of our present state, Where sonles of children do inanimate Bodies of men, no men, except in name, Who like to painted pictures on a frame, Somewhat resemble parents that haue ben, But want that life which made their fathers men: How like weake waters, lying calme and still, Vnder the shadow, our long idle ill Appeares in strangers eyes, who euery where Laugh those to scorne, whom they before did feare: (Deare England, thou great Queene of Ilands all; Whom men the Nurse of armes might whilome call, Thou valours whetstone, that hast often set An edge on dullest nations, and hast whet Cowards with courage, teaching them in field To talke of conquest, that before did yeeld. Why now art thou thy selfe so blunt and dull, That others from thy head may seeme to pull The crowne of Mars? the Belgians that haue ben Thy pupils once, are now the famous men, That great god Neptunes trident scepter wield, Brauing Romes champion in the open field, Vpon whose happie state though peace do smile; Yet can it not their diligence beguile, Base sloath th'industrious nation cannot wrong, Laborious practise makes weake people strong: Vp then for shame in vertue to stand still And not goe one, hath bene esteemd for ill; But to decline from good is worse then naught, By light of ancient times let vs be taught Old customes and good orders to renew, Which our last Canto shall present to view. CANTO. X. The Argument. Our Londons wonted practise shewd Her marching watch, both wishd renewd. Had I the starres of heau'n, or all those leaues, Of which the wind each yeare the woods bereaues When stript of from their bows to ground they fal, For counters to cast vp the summe of all The martiall games and exercises done, Since Londons state to flourish first begonne; Yet would they not in my account auaile me, Time would not serue, and memorie would faile me: For Londons worthy sonnes in elder dayes, By practise of good things to purchase praise, Made Mars his game, not Venus sports their play, In vacant howres to passe the time away: Some like those Romans, who in sport did make A mortall warre vpon that mightie lake Before great Cæsar, on our Thames would fight Their nauall battailes, to the great delight Of all spectators: some againe in field Would practise feates of armes with launce and shield “Who Barons at that time haue stiled ben, Such was their glorie, such their practise then: And from our Steuen to our last Henries dayes, What mightie musters and what braue assayes Of martiall shewes, in vse to keepe our armes Hast thou (O London) made against all harmes? But thou wilt say, that then thy sonnes t'vphold Such customes, freely would impart their gold, But in this baser age, it is not so, For in best actions now the best are sloe: Though this, too true alas, do helplesse keepe Such actions downe, yet from inglorious sleepe, From cut that strumpets sloaths inglorious bed, Amongst thy sonnes lift vp the yong mans head, And councell all the grauer to extend A bounteous hand to euery worthy end, At which all martiall exercise doth aime, Gold is but drosse to the states publike fame, And that we may in calme of peace prepare Defensiue armes, against the stormes of warre: And yet giue life to loue twixt friend and friend Amongst our selues at home, the onely end, For which such actions there beginnings haue, The ghosts of our dead fathers from their graue, By their late actions seeme t'intreate thy state, That once againe they seeke to imitate Their ancestors, in kindling those faire lights, Which did illustrate those two famous nights, The vigils of S. Peter and Iohn Baptist. When Mars did seeme in triumph downe descending, To stoope from heau'n vpon thee, and commending Thy then triumphant March and martiall sport, Deckt in his richest coate of steele, did court A description of Midsommer watch. Peace in thy streets, conducting through the same A warlike troope, that by that yearely game, The noyse of armes made common to thy eares, Might at no time disturbe thee with vaine feares; When drums and trumpets sounds, which do delight A chearefull heart, waking the drowzie night, Did fright the wandring Moone, who from her spheare Beholding earth beneath lookt pale with feare, To see the aire appearing all on flame, Kindled by thy bon-fires, and from the same Athousand sparkes disperst throughout the skie, Which like to wandring starres about did flie; Whose holesome heate purging the aire, consumes The earthes vnholesome vapors, fogges, and fumes; The wakefull shepheard by his flocke in field, With wonder at that time farre of beheld, The wanton shine of thy triumphant fiers, Playing vpon the tops of thy tall spiers Thy goodly buildings, that till then did hide Their rich aray; opend their windowes wide, “Where kings great peeres and many a noble dame, Whose bright pearle-glittering robes did mock y? flame Of the nights burning lights, did sit to see How euery Senator in his degree, Adornd with shining gold and purple weeds, And stately mounted on rich-trapped steeds, Their guard attending through the streets did ride Before their foot-bands, grac'd with glittering pride Of rich guilt armes, whose glory did present A sunshine to the eye, as if it ment Amongst the cresset lights shot vp on hie, To chase darke night for euer from the skie: While in the streets the Stickelers to and fro, To keepe Decorum still did come and go; Where tables set were plentifully spread, And at each doore neighbor with neighbor fed, Where modest mirth attendant at the feast With plentie gaue content to euery guest, Where true goodwill crownd cups with fruitfull wine, And neighbors in true loue did fast combine, Where the lawes pickepurse, strife twixt friend &amp; friend By reconcilement happily tooke end: A happy time, when men knew how to vse The gifts of happy peace, yet not abuse Their quiet rest with rust of ease, so farre As to forget all discipline of warre, VVho oft hath heard wars thunder, seldome feares it, VVhen it affrights his heart, that seldome heares it; For of those troopes, how many a mothers sonne, VVhose eares of late could scarse abide the gun, Traind vp to hand it, now begin to know The postures of the peece, which they did show To many thousand eyes vpon that day, “when London twise ten ensignes did display, The muster on the 8. of August. Beneath whose colours in her streets dispread, And by the conduct of her owne sonnes led, Those foot-b?ds which twise thirteen Wards. tribes did yeeld Deckt in bright armes did march into the field, Where either side the other did oppose, Troope charging troope, like true friends tutned foes, Wanting but order in that feigned fight, Through want of space to do the war-god right: For many thousand old and yong did range The field from troope to troope, and wich is strange, Thousands of our Viragoes stoutley stood Amidst the rankes, as if through wounds and blood In the plaine field, they had conspired then Brauely to win the breeches from the men; When many scard spectators fast did flie, Who falling each on others neckes did lie. Like dying people, groueling on the ground, As if the shot had giuen them deaths wound; While the strong pikes shaking with eagar ire, For that they could not come to their desier, Did threaten them farre of, and wings of shot, Drawne out on either side did play so hot. That men did loose themselues, groping for light In clouds of smoake, as in the midst of night, VVhose thunder Eastward through the aire mad roome To eares of men, as farre as Harrolds Waltham Abbey where Harrold was interd. tombe. And when The late muster the 27. of Sept. that Diamond sparke of royaltie, That bud of hope, Prince of great Brittannie, Like the yong Macedonian Monarch mounted On his Bucephalus, from farre recounted The ensignes of each troope, before his eyes The souldiers steele-topt pikes aduanc'd did rise Like to a corne field wauing vp and downe, And plumes of various colours, which did crowne The souldiers heads beneath the pikes, did show Like colourd flowers, which in the corne do grow, The splendor of guilt armes refulgent light, Danc't in the Sun before his royall sight, As if their glittering gaue a shine more cleare, And the red streaming crosses did appeare Through the darke smoke of gun-shot thundring loud, Like bloody Comets through a sable clowd: But when Mars-like in field approching nigh With martiall staffe vpon his Princely thigh, Attended with a noble troope he came Vnto the Sir Thomas Hayes then Lord Maior. Consuls tent, the lowd exclame And cheareful shouts, which souldiers throtes did yeild For ioy to see their Soueraigns sonne in field: With louder thunder of thicke volleys giuen, Did eccho his true welcome vp to heauen: Before his sight, as euery seuerall band Did march fast by the tent where he did stand, The Captaines shining in rich gold, did show Compar'd to'th souldiers, as the planets do To lesser starres, the men in muster tooke, For limbes composture and for manly looke, For furniture, for armes and rich aray, From other countries bore the praise away: For what sterne eye of enuie, that beheld Their martiall order at that time in field, If equall truth might guide it, could in them, Ought but the want of disclpline condemne; To which defect, since time, true ingenie And practise yeeld the onely remedie: O that god Mars more oft might sing his dittie, In the soft eares of this our peacefull cittie, And that the greedy gripe, that grasps his purse Fast in his fist, and grudges to disburse His coyne to such good vse, would learne to know That Nil Spart? perdat nisi cara pecunia facta. Oracle, which in times past did show, That nothing could the Spartan state disioyne, Except they made too much account of coyne; And that our eldest sonnes of idle ease, Whom nothing but the Taylors cut can please, Would turne superfluous rags of wretched pride, To plates of steele, lay oftentimes aside Theirslender switches for strong staues of Ash, And change perfumes for sulphurie powders flash: But vnto such I wish this good in vaine, As I began, so must I end againe, With Londons Mars-adornd Artillerie, Her onely Nurse of armes yong Infantrie, Bellonas spring where streames of knowledge floe, Garden of Mars where plants of valour grow, (Thrise worthy spirits) euer may you liue, In fames faire booke, whose industrie doth giue, Life to the loue of armes, who both with paine And large expence, the schoole of Mars maintaine, And since the fier of your forward harts To all good actions both in armes and arts, Warmes the cold hopes of London, to renew Her ancient orders, chiefly vnto you I by this pen-man do commend this storie, As the true mirrour of our Londons glorie. This said, the helme-deckt goddesse tooke her rise Vpon her speare, and vanisht from our eyes, Leauing the souldier and my selfe agast; For he, who selfe-loue-swolne sought to blast Our Londons fame, with enuious breath before, Did euer since her noble name adore; And by Minerua, as I was foretaught, Lest her swift vision flying from my thought, I should at last haue lost what I did thinke, I thus did limme the Visions wings with inke.
