      <field name="fulltext">“Mine is the vengeful task to tell, The evils which a P?e befel; When like his ancient godship Jove, He dropp'd into the toils of love.” —Ghost. SUPPRESSED PAMPHLET. “Any person in possession of a Heroic Poem, which lately appeared at a bookseller's in Cornhill, (the Ghost of which is now published,) if they wish to dispose of it, may hear of a purchaser, by addressing a line, post paid, for A. B. at the Clarendon-Hotel, Bond-Street.—State the price.” See The Statesman, for Jan. 29, and Feb. 7, 1812. The Ghost of “R?L Stripes,” which was Prematurely Stifled in its Birth in January, 1812. I See, through the shadows of the tomb, From dark suppression's gloomy womb, A meagre voice indignant breaks, And thus, in hollow accents speaks: II “Though foully hurry'd from the earth; Though choak'd and strangled in my birth; Mine is the vengeful task to spread The secrets of the murder'd dead. III “Mine is the vengeful task to tell The evils which a P?e befel, When, like his ancient godship Jove, He dropp'd into the toils of love. IV Young morn had burst the gates of night, And stood confess'd to mortal sight: From east to west her hues were spread, When the great R?t left his bed! V Well pleas'd his H?ss was to rise, And quit the councils of the wise; Well pleas'd to leave the town's rude noise, And ride in chase of rustic joys. VI “C?e might fail!” the hero cry'd, As his own portly shape he eye'd; “But every gazing fair must pine “To clasp a form well-turn'd like mine! VII “With me e'en T?y would feel bless'd, “And banish coldness from her breast; “Would fly my p?ly kiss to meet, “And pour her riches at my feet.” VIII Mac made complacent answer strait, As the two heroes pass'd the gate. Anon the crackling thongs resound; The warm wheels smoke along the ground. IX From mile to mile the R?t flew, Till O?'s park appear'd in view; Thither did O?'s dame invite him, Doubtless, intending to delight him. X A splendid groupe was ready there, The rich, the noble, and the fair; Anxious each other to outblaze, And fix the R?t's tender gaze. XI The R?t's eyes survey'd the throng, As through the suite he mov'd along; While his warm heart distent with pleasure, Gambol'd to young love's wanton measure! XII Not long his wondering optics stray'd; A dame in modest charms array'd, Soon fix'd the motion of his eye, And made his pr?ly pulse beat high! XIII Mac mark'd the r?l cheek grow pale, And saw the r?l spirits fail; And kindly strove to soothe his pain. And paint his cheek with joy again. XIV But Mac, with sorrow, quickly found That deep and desperate was the wound; And that the sage advice he try'd, Was sage advice—but misapply'd. XV Sighs from the R?t's breast were heard; And trickling downwards to his beard, The briny tears distill'd apace, And channel'd all his r?l face! XVI “O Sir!” says Mac, “suppress these tears; “To weep un-re?ly appears.” “Cease Mac!” says G?e, “your taunts are vain; “Aid me the lovely fair to gain.” XVII Mac knew his master was a rover, A hot, but very changeful lover; From every flower he loved to sip, And gather sweets from every lip! XVIII No more he strove to quench the fire, Or check the reins of wild desire; But by his praises of the dame, Added fresh fuel to the flame. XIX The R?t sigh'd, and Mac look'd wise, Yet wisdom star'd from both his eyes: Deep thoughts seem'd lab'ring in his breast, And thus his tongue his thoughts express'd; XX “Fear not, great Sir, be mine the duty, “To win this kind consenting beauty: “To make her wish to try with Jove, “And yield him equal love for love. XXI “Be mine the task to win her charms, “To crown your hopes, and bless your arms; “To close her lover's jealous eyes, “That might disturb your extacies.” XXII “Dear Mac!” says G?e, “but make her mine, “And all my gratitude is thine: “Thy zeal shall be my constant praise, “And honors wait thy future days. XXIII “Thou shalt have access to my treasures, “And peers shall envy thee thy pleasures; “Dear Mac, but save me from despair, “And thou shalt all my glory share!” XXIV Such promises made Mac grow proud; He sought the lady in the crowd: Aptly perform'd the tender part, And pierc'd and won the lady's heart. XXV “The R?t, burns with love,” says Mac; “Oh! send me not despairing back: “Give me kind words to ease his pain, “And quell the fever in his brain! XXVI “Else will he wail, and pine and sigh, “Grow sick, perhaps, go near to die; “And oh! consider, sweet coronation, “How would his death affect the nation!” XXVII “What does he wish?” the lady cry'd— “A moment's converse,” Mac reply'd— “To speak his love to tell his grief; “To ask for pity and relief! XXVIII “Burnt is his heart—his blood doth bubble; “Add not despair unto his trouble: “Put no new fuel on the fire, “But give him all his soul's desire.” XXIX Mac's matchless eloquence all fail'd; And then he wept, and thus prevail'd, Resolyes which stern words mightiest power, Would melt beneath a briny shower. XXX The lady sigh'd most virtuously, Before she ventur'd to reply; And long the trembling accents hung Before they flutter'd from her tongue XXXI “Will not the P?e my virtue spare? “Why, must I listen to his prayer? “Yet if to listen—is to bless, “I'll calm my fears, and acquiesce: XXXII Flush'd with success and pleasure too, Back to great Jove his Mercury flew; And by soft whisp'ring's in his ear, Banish'd each doubt, remov'd each fear. XXXIII “Dear Mac!” the R?t cry'd with glee, “And do I owe this joy to thee? “This feast so lovely and divine! “Ask what reward thou wilt—'tis thine. XXXIV “Oh! thou art dearer to my heart “Than aught which rank or power impart; “Thy simple worth, dear Mac, alone, “Outweighs the value of a throne!” XXXV The tables groan'd beneath the weight Of costly food, and costlier plate: And hungry lords and ladies seated, With ready zest the dainties greeted. XXXVI In vain the P?e essay'd to eat, His stomach loath'd the unsavoury meat: His sharp anticipating mind Look'd to the feast which lurk'd behind. XXXVII Oft did he curse the tedious meal; Oft from the party wish to steal: To lead his fair to solitude, And taste a more congenial food. XXXVIII At length the hour of bliss drew nigh; The hour of mirth and jollity; The glittering groupes in pairs advance, Eager to twine the mazy dance. XXXIX Apart, the P?e survey'd the fun, And quizz'd the beauties, one by one; But, fairest of the dazzling fair, Y?h's young dame still triumph'd there. XL “Now, Mac!—dear Mac!” the R?t cried; “Go, lead my willing prize aside; “That we may give a loose to pleasure, “And beat quick time to love's soft measure.” XLI Mac sought the fair, and led her strait Through rooms of solitary state, Where not a sound disturb'd the scene, But all was silent and serene. XLII The trembling dame felt sore opprest; Sad terrors hector'd in her breast; But Virtue's guardian sylph was near, And whisper'd courage in her ear. XLIII Meanwhile the R?t's boisterous blood Thrill'd through his veins, a boiling flood; His heart was parch'd with lawless fire, His pulse beat quick with wild desire. XLIV And soft and sly he slunk away, Homage at Cupid's shrine to pay; Careless of honor, mirth, and fame; Thoughtful alone of Y?h's dame. XLV The lady afraid how she should fare, Had scarcely closed her secret prayer, When G?e rush'd in, by love inspir'd, And Mac, with modest bow retir'd. XLVI “Now gentle fair one, lend your ear, “And hear your constant R?t swear, “By all below, and all above, “My heart and soul are full of love! XLVII “By all the saints which dwell in heaven! “By all the joys to mortals given! “By air, and fire, and earth, and sea! “Thee I adore. and only thee! XLVIII “Thee I adore, then give me peace, “And bid my breast its struggles cease! “For should thy tongue my wish deny, “Oh! what has G?e to do but die!” XLIX The trembling fair beheld the hook, And like a shivering asper shook; She saw her peril, and look'd round, But none to interfere was found. L Thus in a poacher's hands a hare, Trembles its fears, and looks its prayer; In silence did the maid endeavour To shun the kiss of p?ly favour. LI Bold, and more bold the R?t grew! And from one kiss advanced to two! For love is seldom scar'd by looks, But needs more vigorous rebukes. LII The fair one now began to chide, And thus with angry voice she cry'd, “Dread Sir! although a P?e so great, “I must not chuse you for my mate! LIII “To Y?h's lord, my faith is plight; “Oh! do not strive that faith to blight;— “It may not, must not, shall not be, “I cannot Y?h leave for thee!” LIV Now doubly rag'd the fire of love, And half consum'd our mortal Jove; “Great Gods!” he cry'd, “must I be cross'd “Shall thus my lovely game be lost!” LV “Two ways appear, fair lady chuse, “One you must take, or one refuse; “Be kind and speedy in your choice, “Your fate depends upon your voice. LVI “I ask that love my hopes to bless, “Which I, by force, may soon possess: “Chuse then to give what I require, “Or strength shall second my desire.” LVII The lady then astonish'd stood, Regardless of the r?l blood, And said “for ever I shall scorn “On Y?h's brow to plant a horn! LVIII “Then thus,” at length, the R?t cries— “Thus will I seize my valued prize.” He said, and in his p?ly arms, He lock'd the fair and all her charms. LIX But, careless of his rank and grace, The lady scratch'd his r?l face! The more he kiss'd her, and insisted, The more she struggled and resisted. LX While thus the war of words ran high, And anger flash'd from every eye: Sudden the door wide open flew, And Y?h stood confess'd to view. LXI Then of his p?ly breast, so gay, Love took his leave, and flew away; While terror banish'd wild desire, And quench'd fierce passion's ardent fire. LXII Frantic with joy, the fair one ey'd Her faithful Y?h at her side; And quickly to his ear repeated, How by the P?e she had been treated. LXIII The peer's indignant feelings rose, And words were soon exchang'd for blows: No rebel eloquence he tries, But boldly blacks the gallant's eyes. LXI In vain the P?e for mercy cry'd; “Perfidious man!” the peer reply'd; “Presum'st thou thus my friend to use, “My honor and my love abuse!” LXV Enrag'd the lover met his doom, From Y?h's cane—unfriendly boon, 'Till his bruiz'd H?ss, faint and sore, Stretch'd his fine form on the floor! LXVI Drawn by his r?l brother's cries, Illustrious Y?k to save him tries: Oh! had his G?e but deign'd to run, The injury had not been done. LXVII But, oh! too long the D?e delay'd; Too late he came the P?e to aid; C?e came in, and both soon led, The wounded viceroy to his bed. LXVIII Now liad this P?e forborne to roam, But staid with mother F?z at home; Or had he been content to stay, With venal dames to kiss and play— LXIX Or had he, with some unmatch'd fair His r?l favor deign'd to share— A thousand to a doit I'll lay, Peril had never cross'd his way. But he who deals in enterprize, From safety's path most surely flies; And is thrice blest if he escapes So slightly bruiz'd, from serious scrapes. LXX Long may his H?ss live to mend, And to no evil thoughts attend; May he incline to virtue's banners; And not invade protected manors! And now God bless his r?l name, And all his family; And when he hugs another dame, May I be there to see!</field>
