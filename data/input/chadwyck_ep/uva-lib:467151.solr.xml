      <field name="fulltext">IN HOSPITAL I Nothing of itself is in the still'd mind, only A still submission to each exterior image, Still as a pool, accepting trees and sky, A candid mirror that never a breath disturbs Nor drifted leaf,—as if of a single substance With every shape and colour that it encloses,— When, alone and lost in the morning's white silence, Drowsily drowsing eyes, empty of thought, Accept the blank breadth of the opposite wall. Lying in my bed, motionless, hardly emerged From clouds of sleep,—a solitary cloud Is not more vague in the placeless blue of ether Than I, with unapportioned and unadjusted Senses, that put off trouble of understanding, Even the stirring of wonder, and acquiesce. The early light brims over the filled silence. Memory stirs not a wave or a shadow within me. Only the wall is the world; there stops my sight. II If he should bend his bow, that great Archer There before me, if tautened and all erect Slowly he should draw the arrow back to his ear, Suddenly I should see the curve of his tense body Alter, and O at the leap of the sighted arrow The arms descend, shoulder and hip relax. But hidden in his face, hidden the bow behind him. I see the square of the buckle that clasps embossed The belt girding the slenderness of his loins, The smooth and idle energy of his arms, And under the mould of breast and flank I feel The invisible veins and warm blood pulsing through them. But why is his face hidden? And why does my heart Beat with a fear that he may be all disclosed Terrible in calm, terrible in beauty and power? For his eyes must surely be filled with the far mountains, Rivers and great plains be his eyes' possession; And full in the centre of his concentred vision Stands his victim, he who is soon to be stricken, Soon to fall, with the arrow pouncing upon him, The arrow that carries the light and scorn of his eyes. Why do you hide your face, glorious Archer? If I could see you, then though the arrow pierced me Gazing upon you, it were a glory to fall. Will you at last, seizing the bow, bend it? Now, as I gaze? A thrilling of fear rushes Blind in my veins: fear? is it fear, or hope? As if all my gaze were fixt on a drop of water Suspended, about to fall and still not falling, A liquid jewel of slowly increasing splendour As the rain retreats and the shadow of cloud is lifted And all light comes to enclose itself in the circle Of a single drop, so is this suspended moment. III The stillness moves. Tripping of feet; shadows; Voices. The hospital wakes to its ritual round. The moment breaks; the drop, the bright drop falls. A sponge has prest its coldness over my spirit. Shape and colour abandon their apparition, Subside into place in the order of usual things. And another mind returns with the day's returning, Weaving its soft invisible meshes around me. This is the daylight, bald on the plain wall. Cracks in the paint, a trickle of random lines, A trailing scrawl that a child might trace with a stick As he runs idly about the ebb-tide sands— Is it out of these I supposed a towering image There on the blankness? Are you gone, my Archer, You who were living more than the millions waking? No, you are there still! It was I released you Out of the secret world wherein you are hidden. You are there, there; and the arrow is flying, flying.... And yet patient, as if nothing were endangered, We do small things and keep the little commandments,— We and our doings a scribble upon the wall. ANNIVERSARY (November 11) I Thunder in the night! Vague, ghostly, remote It rolls. The world sleeps. Suddenly splitting the air, Stumbles a crash: and a million sleepers awake, Each in his silence menaced, and all aware. The aroused and secret spirit in each listens, Companioned by an invisible listening host, And sees the blackness gashed with quaking light, Surrendered then to sounds of a world lost In a heart-shaking convulsion of senseless force, Wandering and warring blasts of a monstrous breath, Legendary Chaos throned in heaven and dealing Purposeless darts, and the air vivid with death. But we, we are men, that walk upright in the sun, That judge, question, remember, and foresee. What have we to do with blind demons of air? We choose and act; aim, reason, and are free. Thunder in the night! As stupefying and sudden, The stumbling crash of the nations into flame Woke us aghast! We looked, we heard; we knew That from us men the inhuman chaos came. From reason, frenzy; from knowledge, blindness; from pity, Cruelty! Trapped in Necessity's iron net, To be free, to be free, we battled, and hoped the dawn, Nor counted cost, if flesh could pay the debt. O beauty broken! O glory of thought exiled! O flowers in a furnace tossed! O joy defaced! O sense and soul grown used in the fire, assenting To brute futility, torture, and waste, waste! The Spirit of Man in anguish amid the cloud And the antiphons of thunder, and earth upheaved, Beheld amazed the deeds of its body, and rose In them to a splendour strange and unconceived. II They who simply heard the call of their own land, The fields, the hills, the hamlets that they knew, Hurt and in peril, and questioned not, but went, To a fibre deep in the very body true; They who high in hope of youth and flame of faith Streamed to the storm with a beating heart of pride Because that threat towered black against the sun, Who fell, and made a radiance where they died; They who would not for their soul's sake stand apart, They who took upon themselves the world's red stain, Who saw, who loathed, yet would not bear to watch The struggle of others in unpartner'd pain; They who still, when the mind sickened, and faith darkened, And falsehood clung as the mud clung, and the cloud Confused, and horror gnawed, endured to death, Still seeing the star to which their course was vowed; Them we name over, them we recall to-day, Whose dear bodies in foreign earth are laid. Ours is the light to breathe, and a world to mould: But over them all is sleep; their hands are stayed. Have we only remembering tears, and flowers to strew? They are crying to us with the cry of the unfulfilled, Like the earth aching for spring, when frosts are late. Are we the answer? Or shall they twice be killed? Their pain is upon us, pain of hope imperilled. They are crying to us with the spirit's untold desires. Heart, brain, and hand, the will and the vision—all, And more than all, the Cause of Man requires. We stumble and plod; by little and little we gain. Old folly tempts, old habit about us twines. But to-day our eyes are lifted, and hearts with them; And near, as the stillness falls, the Vision shines. 1928 MEDITERRANEAN VERSES [I] The desert sand at day's swift flight Drank of the dew-cold vivid night Where Nile flows as he flowed When first men reaped and sowed As though his stream since Time began Bore all the history of Man, Vast ages lapsing brief As noiseless as a leaf. But when the first high star, concealed Itself by shadowing boughs, revealed The glinting ripple, it seemed As the great water streamed That ears attuned might hear the strings Plucked by the harpist for those kings Who in persistence fond Would be companion'd Through the faint under-world, and still Press the firm-clustered grape, and feel Wind from the fanning plume Sweetened with incense-fume; Still watch the honey-coloured grain Stiffen to ripeness on the plain, Or dancers with slim flanks Circle in chiming ranks. For Time, so old, must abdicate: Eyes and a smile that have no date Respond from chiselled stone Young as, each day, the dawn; And pulsings of the carver's wrist So subtly in those curves persist, The presence in the form To touch is almost warm. But like the pictures dreams make glow On darkness, that in daylight go So soon, except they find Some lodging in the mind, Only by beauty can these cross The dark stream of the dead to us. Only the hot sun dwells 'Mid those long parallels Of broken pillars, roofed with air, In temples of unanswered prayer; And Gods unfeasted own Naught but a granite throne. II Rain and the scolding wind's uproar And the black cloud befitted more The towering walls that hem Teeming Jerusalem; City of wailing, wrath, and blood, The city of the grave and shroud, Whence arose the Word That brought so sharp a sword. O city stubbornly enthroned! The city that the prophets stoned, Over which Jesus wept, And proud Rome vainly swept! But as from heavens of brooding love A peace unearthly beamed above The hill-surrounded sea Of lonely Galilee. And we beneath those silent skies Walked among flowers of paradise, As if their happier seed Knew peace on earth indeed. Peace, by the world praised and eschewed, Lived in that ageless solitude And with no phrases deckt Shone richer in neglect. And under stony hills severe, Where sounds are few, we still could hear The shepherd from the rock Pipe to his wandering flock. Remote beyond the Syrian bay At close of a long burning day Into the dusk still shone The snows of Lebanon. III Morning came dancing, Morning warmed The blue sea-circle, whence she charmed Isle after isle to rise Rock-pointed toward the skies, Whose names transfigured strand and cape Into a legendary shape Re-peopled from afar But to be brought more near; As if old ships and oar'd galleys Still swept along the silent seas; Sailors of Tyre in quest Of the remoter West; Athenians racing to undo Their own decree, before it slew; And Cleopatra's sail From Actium flying pale; And traffickers with rich Byzance Past Patmos fading, lost in trance; And Paul, on fire within The sad world's soul to win; And Rudel in love's dear duress Turned eastward to his Far Princess, To die for that one bliss, The first and the last kiss; And doomed Othello Cyprus-bound.— The islands rose and sank around, And when the day declined Their shadows filled the mind. Dim in the dawn stood Hector's ghost Upon the mound where Troy lies lost. But through the straits we sped Turned to our dearer dead. IV The hills divide, the seas unite The valleys of a land of light, But O how bare beside That Hellas glorified Which, wasted, clan by warring clan, Yet made a splendour shine in Man By that inquiring will Whose way we follow still; Built in the mind his palace rare, Towered high as thought can dare And thronged with images Of joys and agonies, Confronting destiny and wrong With the high-symbol'd scene, and song Threading its music through The tale of wrath and rue. But Time, so tender to a thought That branches up from living root, Has here unbuilt, defaced, And Beauty dispossessed, Conniving with men's minds inert, Brute blows, and stupid skill to hurt, As if 'twere half their joy To maim and to destroy. O Delphi, where all Hellas came To hear the awful Voice proclaim Fate, how beneath your steep Is all-forgetting sleep! No voice, no votary, no shrine; Though the long vale be still divine From that blue bay below To the far mountain snow, And soundless noon that idly warms The scattered stones and shattered forms Only the shadow brings Of wheeling eagles' wings. V In the last light some column glows Where once a white perfection rose Imperfectly divined By the rebuilding mind, Which treasures up a shape, a thought, From footprint or from echo caught; Hard gleanings, that attest Oblivion has the best. Fade coasts and isles, where the seed sown Still flowers in all we are and own. A future presses near Clouds of unshapen fear. And now the ghostly, vast night-fall Like an age closing past recall Seems, and this darkening sea The wastes of history; The sea that no proud trophy claims For sunken ventures, foundered fames, Dishevelled navies tost, Ships like a bubble lost; That keeps no sure abiding form And rises in unconscious storm Whipt by an ignorant blast, And when the fury's past, Sleeking its waves, mile after mile, Into the image of a smile. Is this what Time does still, Working a witless will? But through the dark, stopt by no seas, Pass other Powers and Presences Unseen from shore to shore, Armed and at conscious war, Ideas, mightier than men, That seize and madden, free or chain. The things unprophesied Our prophecies deride; But end is none, though the storms break And the mind pale, and the heart shake. Out of that future ring Far trumpets challenging. 1935 AUGUST AFTERNOON Thump of a horse's hoof behind the hedge; Long stripes of shadow, and green flame in the grass Between them; discrowned, glaucous poppy-pods On their tall stalks; a rose With its great thorns blood-red in the slant light; Round apples swelling on the apple-boughs:— Over these, over the rich quiet, comes Out of no-where a 'plane in the high blue Driving its angry furrow across the sky, Outstrips the slow clouds, throbs, an urgent roar, Right overhead, and fiercely vanishes. The quiet has become strange. Like from pools A noiseless water issuing, memories, Surmises, apprehensions, traceless thoughts, Glide with brief visions on the mind, drifting From shadow into shadow; and then a pang Sudden as when a meteor scars the night: See where Christ's blood streams in the firmament! Dead faces of the young, that see nothing... The unknown wounds, everywhere, everywhere... And then from the inner to the outer sense Returns the sun-warm quiet on the grass, The poppy charged with sleep, the red, red thorns, The stamping of the horse behind the hedge, The strong slow patience of the living earth And the apple ripening on the apple-tree Almost as if I felt it in my flesh. 1936 THE NORTH STAR I was contented with the warm silence, Sitting by the fire, book on knee; And fancy uncentred, afloat and astray, Idled from thought to thought Like a child picking flowers and dropping them In a meadow at play. I was contented with the kind silence, When there invaded me— Not a sound, no, there was no sound, But awareness of a menace Creeping up round The little island of my mind; A creeping up of gradual waves out of a sea, With storm coming behind; Wave on pale wave, smile on inhuman smile, Driven on by the black force of alien will To drown my world, to be the burial Of joy, beauty, and all That seemed impossible to kill; Even the secret home that hope inherited. I sat in an unreal room alone. Befriending and familiar shapes were gone: And I was seized with dread. Then I became restless, As if in bonds that must at any cost be burst. The very peace seemed to oppress: I was imprisoned and athirst, And rose, and crossed the floor, Craving to front the naked outer night. At the opened door Stood a thin mist, ghostly and motionless. Smell of the leaves rotting Breathed through a cold vapour Bitter to the nostril. My feet stumbled; In my heart was a cry: O for some single point of certitude! I lifted up my face, and saw the sky. There where I stood Low mist clung to the earth. But above, pale and diminished, Only the larger lights pierced the dim air. I faced the North. And far and faint over a shadowy pine That rose out of the mist I saw the North Star shine. I remembered sailors of old For whom unclouded night Was stretched above the dark Mediterranean, A blue tapestry pricked with powdery gold, Where legendary presences shone bright, Each with a memory and a name; And under the luminous maze Steering by the North Star Ships to their harbour came. And now through thick silence On the stifled fog-possessed Atlantic I was hearing, distant or near, Muffled answer of horn to horn, The rocking clang of the buoy-bell,— Sound crossing sound, to warn Steamers, that on their blinded motion still Unfaltering over seas invisible Held to a silent clue Because with the assurance of that star The needle points them true. There was a voice whispered: Ascend, ascend! Out of the earthy vapour, out Of the invading doubt, Into deliverance, into bare Heights of unmeasured air. Utterly stilled I stood, Climbing in dizzying thought without an end To that magnetic light, That affirmation of old certitude. And pinnacled alone in the vast night My thought was there. Oh, earth is gone. My earth is lost. North Star, North Star, Dost thou fail me? Thou art not what thou wast, And all I was is taken from my mind: For there is neither path nor direction For any thought to find, No North, nor South, nor East, nor West, But homelessness suspended out of time, Where I had sought to climb. North Star, it was no shroud Of mist, nor glory of overflowing sun; It was no blotting curtain of blank cloud, But a thought in the mind that deposed thee. Down, down I sink: Earth again holds me. Again, North Star, I see thee shine. But from the naked night I will not shrink; And privately I take A courage for thy sake, Because thou hast thy place and I have mine; Because I still need thee; Because thou need'st not me. 1938 SOWING SEED As my hand dropt a seed In the dibbled mould And my mind hurried onward To picture the miracle June should unfold, On a sudden before me Hanging its head, With black petals Rotting and tainted, Stood a flower, dead; As if all the world's hope Were rotting there, A thing to weep for, Ripe for burial, Veined with despair. Yet I cannot prevent My ignorant heart From trust that is deeper Than fear can fathom Or hope desert. The small twy-bladed Shoot will thrust To brave all hazards. The seed is sown And in Earth I trust. THE TREMBLING TREE On greenest grass the lace of lights Beneath the shadowing tree Trembles, as when eyes more than lips Are smiling silently. Its motion all but motionless Is like a dancer's feet Half-stirred, half-stilled, ere music throb To float them on its beat. Is it a music ears can hear? Or in a world so jarred With inward wrong, is it a sound Too happy to be heard? O tell me, tell me! Could I slip The time's perversity, There would be music in the air And I that trembling tree. A spirit smiling to itself Seems in those leaves to live; And for a moment, lost in it, I can this world forgive. THERE IS STILL SPLENDOUR I O when will life taste clean again? For the air Is fouled: the world sees, hears; and each day brings Vile fume that would corrupt eternal things, Were they corruptible. Harsh trumpets blare Victory over the defenceless; there Beauty and compassion, all that loves the light, Is outcast; thousands in a homeless night Climb misery's blind paths to the peak, Despair. Not only martyr'd flesh, but the mind bleeds. There's nothing left to call inhuman, so Defaced is man's name by the things men do. O worse, yet worse, if the world, seeing this, The hideous spawn of misbegotten creeds, Grow used, drugged, deadened, and accept the abyss. II There is still splendour: the sea tells of it From far shores, and where murder's made to lurk In the clean waters; there, men go to work Simply, upon their daily business, knit Together in one cause; they think no whit Of glory; enough that they are men. To those Who live by terror, calmly they oppose What wills, dares, and despises to submit. And the air tells of it: out of the eye's ken Wings range and soar, a symbol of the free, In the same cause, outspeeding the swift wind. Millions of spirits bear them company. This is the splendour in the souls of men Which flames against that treason to mankind. December 1939 ENGLISH EARTH As over English earth I gaze, Bare down, deep lane, and coppice-crowned Green hill, and distance lost in blue Horizon of this homely ground, A light that glows as from within Seems glorifying leaf and grass And every simple wayside flower That knows not how to say Alas! O Light, by which we live and move, Shine through us now, one living whole With dear earth! Arm us from within For this last Battle of the Soul! 1940 AIRMEN FROM OVERSEAS Who are these that come from the ends of the oceans, Coming as the swallows come out of the South In the glory of Spring? They are come among us With purpose in the eyes, with a smile on the mouth. These are they who have left the familiar faces, Sights, sounds and scents of familiar land, Taking no care for security promised aforetime, Sweetness of home and the future hope had planned. A lode-star drew them: Britain, standing alone Clear in the darkness, not to be overcome, Though the huge masses of hate are hurled against her.— Wherever the spirit of freedom breathes, is Home. Soon are they joined with incomparable comrades, Britain's flower, Britain's pride, Against all odds despising the boastful Terror; On joyous wings in the ways of the wind they ride. From afar they battle for our ancient island, Soaring and pouncing, masters of the skies, They are heard in the night by the lands betrayed and captive And a throbbing of hope to their thunder-throb replies. To dare incredible things, from the ends of ocean They are coming and coming over the perilous seas. How shall we hail them? Truly there are no words And no song worthy of these. 1940 THE VOICES OF HELLAS Time, that has crumbled to impotent nothingness Empire on empire, towering in arrogance, Time, at whose finger invisibly commanding Their bannered battalions marched to oblivion, Time stays motionless when are heard the voices Of Hellas, proclaiming over a wondering world Wisdom and joy and the radiance of reality Disclosed as in an eternal sunrise. Clear as the mountain-peaks (O many-mountained Hellas!) soar in the morning splendour When the valleys below them drowse in shadow, Those voices into the light uplift us. Now in the hour of menacing malignity Hellas, holding the ancient passes Stands for the world's cause, knowing it invincible, Knowing that beside her stand the Immortals. November 1940 KOYA SAN Koya San (Mount Koya) is a sacred mountain near Osaka in Japan. On it are many temples, and at the top is a cemetery surrounding the grave of the famous Buddhist saint Kobo, before whose shrine a light perpetually burns. High on the mountain, shrouded in vast trees, The stillness had the chastity of frost. I trod the fallen pallors of the moon. The path was paven stone: I was not lost, But followed whither it should lead me soon Into the mountain's midmost secrecies. Wandering into the mind, sweet, luminous, warm Remembrances of the body,— Smell of the woods in the irradiated noonday, Flushes of foliage, The ridged horizon opening far and blue,— Came with a breathing of colour, and then sank Remote as flames gleam in a dark pane glassed. Earth had rolled onward into regions new, And all the darkness at my senses drank, Aware now, subtly, as of a frontier passed. On either side the trees unending rose. No shadowy sound stirred amid all their plumes. Each seemed a separate and a soaring night, Black canopies of cold uncounted tombs. Pilgrims had here fallen on their repose: Graven with names, their tablets gleamed upright. And softly as the fallen lightness of a willow-leaf On the liquid stealing Of water unrippled, profound, my spirit was stolen By the crystal silence. And with me it seemed invisible others went, Spirits unhistoried, of such dim surmise As in the dark the tremble of a leaf. With them I went, and Night was eloquent Of things that are not in the day's belief, And made me of those things, like a blind man, wise. Obscurity at last relented round A glimmering space: the inmost Shrine appeared. Before it, motionless as any tree, Praying, a pilgrim stood. There was a sound Of water in the distance hardly heard: But most that living man astonished me. Many stone lanterns made a clustered shining As if in a wondrous Cavern of lost and intricate shadows, enclosing The light's clear vigil; But the air behind that solitary form Was trembling like a veil of trembling light, Where from an urn rose endless incense-fume That left a ghostly fragrance on the night. It seemed a spirit sighing to resume The touch of what was breathing, human, warm. Bare-headed, sandalled, still that pilgrim prayed, Unconscious of all else but his heart's prayer. Out of his breast a broken murmur deep Came with his frosted breathing on the air Before the shrine in its tree-guarded shade Where that great Saint continued in his sleep. It seemed that from Time's beginning he had stood there In a hushed vastness, Solitary, erect, amid the unimagined motion Of worlds unnumbered, Absorbed, secure in his small star of light. And now that ceaseless, fugitive frail smoke Appeared to me like shadowy souls in flight Woven together into a veil of breath That wavered as their little life awoke And passed for ever into birth or death. What prayer was his that mingled with the mist Of the forgotten sighings of the dead? I knew not; yet in him I seemed to share Longings that still were patient to persist Through Time and Death from lips that once were red. In that one image all my kind stood there. Lover of the body, lover of the divine sun, Of earth's replenished Fullness and change and savour of life rejoicing Careless of all care, Me now the Silence for its vessel chose And filled from wells unsounded by the mind. No other need I had, and could not less Than to be wholly to this spell resigned And dark communion with the spirit that knows Vigil and frost and solitariness. Fragments we are, and none has seen the whole. Only some moment wins us to restore The touch of infinite companionship. I that had journeyed from so far a shore Found at the world's end the same pilgrim soul, And the old sorrow, no flight can outstrip. Now in the midst of the irradiated noonday Suddenly absent, While in my ear is the sound of familiar voices, Light talk and laughter, My thought has in an instant flown the seas; A great remoteness occupies my heart; And there arises on my inward sight The shadowy apparition of vast trees. A pathway opens; I am stolen apart, And I ascend a mountain in the night. MATSUSHIMA O paradise of waters and of isles that gleam, Dark pines on scarps that flame white in a mirrored sky, A hundred isles that change like a dissolving dream From shape to shape for them that with the wind glide by! Many celestial palaces, gardens of scented song, Have hearts of men imagined for lost happiness; But merely around these isles, the live sea streams among Salt with a pulsing tide, no languid lake's caress, To sail and ever sail, with not a sound to feel In the clean blue, but silence vivid with delight, A silence winged with rush of the dividing keel, As if the world's sorrow and folly had taken flight, Suspended pale as that faint circle far-away Of mountain, and remote as ocean's murmuring miles, This, only this, for me were paradise to-day, O paradise of waters, paradise of isles. MIYAJIMA Miyajima is a small island covered with trees and rising to a peak, in Japan's Inland Sea. Neither birth nor death is permitted to take place on its sacred soil. All paths lead upward to the sky In this green isle, which mounts on high Through slumbrous valleys, veiled in light From waters dancing blue and bright. And on those leafy paths appear Delicately stepping deer That move in wild and silent grace, The very spirits of the place. Whether by old pine-roots they stand Or print small hoof-marks on sea-sand, Their liquid eyes, their gentle tread, Are innocent of human dread. Beneath the ancient boughs they seem Strayed from the memory or the dream Or hope of man, the Golden Age, His unrecovered heritage. This sacred isle has banished death; And yet I would that my last breath Might amid ocean-murmur cease On such an isle, in such a peace. ANGKOR The famous remains of the vast temple at Angkor in Cambodia are still magnificent. At a little distance from it are the ruins of the city, held in the strangling grip of the tropical vegetation. The “Stone Faces” are the fourfold image of Siva on the temple called the Bayon. I Out of the Forest into a terrible splendour Of noon, the pinnacles of the temple-portals, Stone Faces, immense in carven ruin Above the trembling of giant trees emerge. Stone Faces, of secret and eternal smile, Ruined Faces, perilously towering Over the waving of the wilderness, a fourfold Gaze, opposing the slow strength of Time; Visible afar, stony serenity, crown Of the builders' labour of imagination, Last and loftiest thought of a little dust, That once, robed in authority, moved commanding, When overseeing his busy-handed companies Of workmen, and elephants hoisting obedient, A King magnificent, satiate of victory, Builded his vision of the eternal Peace; Have you not heard, alone in your abandonment Since the last echoing vibrations vanished Of tremulous fame diminishing, have you not 'Mid the resplendent silence of the noon Heard the cry of the little seed in the earth Prisoned and crying to the mighty Sun in heaven With his strong beams to find and to deliver her? Through million miles of air is heard her cry; The cry of Desire, that aches with a blind throbbing, Ignorant of all but the aching of its desire, Desire inappeasable, cruel as a desert thirst, Desire born of desire, breeding desire? In lust of light it springs from the little seed, Climbing out of the hot suffocation of darkness, Multiplying, bursting, swelling to burst afresh, Writhing and wrestling to mount into the light. And up from the furnaces of its own corruption As with a trample of triumph, to the imperious Sting of the Sun and the prodigally spending Wanton rain, surges the sap in answer. As if it were red blood boiling in the suddenness Of panther's sinewy and ungovernable spring; As if it were an invisible conflagration Glorying up into a momentary splendour, The sap presses, stronger than spirting fountains, Reasonless, wild as the doubled strength of madmen; Invisible and unheard, it races into The boughs, and the boughs stream out into the leaves. Roots thrust downward into the black heat of earth; Boughs descend, thicken, and root themselves afresh; The builded fabric is seized and is enfolded In the tightening of those fibres, passive as a victim. Supplanting the jamb, a root upholds the lintel; Cracking the rounded column and delicately-carved Frieze, with slow muscle the serpent-folds Fasten increasing, crush or twist awry; Invented order and scruple of willed proportion, The strong square, all the lineaments of reason, Lost in the green extravagance, the strangling Young embraces of a pitiless desire. Vast blocks, upheaved as by an elephant's Shouldering force, are incredibly suspended By vast stems, that swelling slow like pythons Capture a purchase for their upward towering. The ancient meditation of the Gods is prisoned As in the clasp of heavy and voluptuous arms. The still presence of Peace is broken in fragments: Ruined and fabulous is the eternal smile. The Stone Faces look from a lost battle Over the ascending wilderness, the nearing Waves of Time re-conquering Eternity, As a beaten rock left on a crumbling strand. II Images people the shadows and throng the sun-soaked Porches; demon forms, and the armed striding Of warriors; frowns of scorn and limbs of anger; And 'mid their conflict, shapes of young delight. Ah, Heavenly Dancer, motioned by an ecstasy Breathed into stone, O time-delivered vision, Image of celestial joy everlasting Sung by the body to the Spirit's flute! Now like a shipwreckt remnant of security Drifted to shore by the negligent ocean-streams, Thou hidest, shaped into the image of humanity, As lips hide speech, the Spirit's profound desire. In a trance the eye can behold the hands that formed thee, Supple hands, chiselling the stone's resistance To a thought in the fingers' pressure and smooth relentings Transfiguring ancient stone to breathing mind Like as the distant gaze and sky-divining Will of the helmsman, with touches light as breath Shape the speed of a winged keel to union With the firm wind's invisible inspiration. The hand traces; the blood thinks and pauses; Fingers marry and divide; perfecting motions, Delicately measuring, shape into significance Dreams: But hands have purpose, these have none, These strong fibres, strong as the whole body Of a wrestler locked in an obstinate tenacity Of effort, clutch of innumerable tendrils, Never relaxing their terrible embrace! Live, Live! they cry, as they mount exuberant— Whither? O whither the seething, savage ardour Craving, and riotous in its own destruction? Answers only the silence of the Sun. The silence of the Sun possesses the still cranny. Smooth lizards flicker across the abraded wall. High amid molten splendour in topmost trees The indolent gibbon swings from branch to branch; Song of birds, rippling an airy and strange chime, And shrilled unceasing chorus of cicalas Crown the ruined history of proud peoples. The Forest burns in the crucible of the Sun. III Out of the moulder of Time and great oblivion Shines the remoteness of legendary majesties, Willed to remain high over farthest sundown, Now in a memory melting insubstantial. Solomon the King built a temple in Jerusalem For the glory of the Lord to inhabit for eternity. Lebanon from her forests gave him cedar and cypress; These became pillar and beam and coffered ceiling Carved with lily and gourd and palm and pomegranate; And all overlaid was the house within with gold. Stone was the foundation; in the midmost was the oracle: There Solomon ascended to the secrecy of the Lord. It was told to Solomon: There is a queen in Saba, In Saba of sweet valleys, of spices and precious stones. Young she is and comely; and she seeks after wisdom. Great pity it is that she worshippeth the Sun. Balkis the queen had grave men for her counsellors, Warriors stood before her to execute her bidding. She was wise in her body's secret wisdom of beauty: But none knew her wisdom; it flowed not from her lips. It was told in the ears of Balkis: Solomon the King Is wiser than all men, even the sages of Egypt. Also he has riches beyond computation; Armies he has and navies, and seven hundred wives. Learned is he in the tongues of beast and bird, In the hearts of the fishes and of all creeping things. And Balkis was seized with a marvelling curiosity: I will see this Solomon, said Balkis, and arose, And with heavy-laden camels she journeyed to Jerusalem. And Solomon accepted her Arabian spice: he showed her The splendour of his house, his servants and all his horsemen, And the temple founded to be the Lord's for ever. Solomon and Balkis sat upon lofty thrones Together; the bright birds of the air thronged round them, Many-coloured plumage; and the King knew their voices, The lion in the desert also he heard afar. Solomon spoke not of his own magnificence And the things he had shown her, surpassing belief and rumour, Till her heart was faint; he had shown her all these marvels, And not a question asked he had not answered. But he spoke of the Temple wherein he had newly housed The glory of the invisible God, creator Of all men, even of Solomon and his wisdom; The temple built to endure for everlasting. Then were they silent. Evening descended on them; And the low sun smote that high place in Jerusalem Over against all the splendour of the Temple That seemed eternity flaming before their eyes. In the gaze of Solomon was a great contentment With all he had willed and all he had performed. But still in the unreasonable memory of Balkis Was the cry of the seed to the glory of the Sun. IV Lips imperious, bosom superb! Eyes Smiling with all persuasion to all adventure! Veins that leap in the lightning of ecstasy! Spirit Of splendour and storm, peril of Caesar and sage! Whether to charm the eagle mind from form its solitude And wondrously to enter the secret and strange places Of wisdom, passionately importuning that ultimate Possession, satiate of all else beside; Or with subtle tendrils of pleasure serpentining About the strength of the stony will, and weaving Nets invisible, merciless, inescapable, Softly to master the mastery of the strong; Or stung by profounder hunger of satisfaction, Incarnate Flame, to tower a rapturous moment Over an empire fallen in ashes, exulting To vanish in legend, having destroyed a world; From what seed sown in the ignorant immensity Of existence, ascend you into agonies and furies, Not joy, not pain, but necessity of deliverance, To enchant, to burn into victory and perish? These dead doorways, black squares of emptiness, Framed in vivid stone that scorches the hand And dazzles the sight, are not so hollow As the sockets that housed the brilliance of your eyes; And this palsy of twisted and whitened fibre, Dangling inert athwart the interior blackness, Is not so wasted as the suppleness of arms Moulded to be chains about the necks of conquerors. All that interior triumph of the throbbing heart Throbbing through wall and pillar and through the hardness Of men, dissolving fortresses, is quieter Than dust in the corner; earth from you has peace. O Stone Faces, was it a far-off vision Of Peace that the builder imagined when he shaped you, That shadowy King, to endure beyond his memory And awe with eternal mask the children of Time? Surely in his heart was a vision of Life the Destroyer Dancing the dance of Desire, the all-creating All-destroying; Power from Power proceeding, Or Death from Death issuing, who shall know, Or who distinguish the inconceivable riches From the inconceivable ruin, the victory crowned with Annihilation? Afraid of his own vision, He lent it human lineaments of Peace. V Here in the forest, under a roof of mats, Cross-legged sitting, with a bowl beside him, Waited the Hermit in his still persistence, Motionless contemplating the eternal motion. Come back, thou Hermit, here in the fierce forest To thine own station—whether from a handful Of dust remoulded, or from the wandered worlds Of air, an essence into Time resumed! Still as a flame is still in a windless place, Seeking thy far and invisible affinity, I see thee, careless of emperors and captains As of the tree-tops towering above thee; Hearing not clash of arms, nor the resounding Triumph, nor cry of the vanquished, but with senses Unfeasted, sure of that foreknown subsiding Into the silence where thy thought is native. Round thy ribs slowly fasten the serpent-roots; Over thee meshes that insatiate voracity As with mouths thirsting for life's fierce savour, As with limbs lusting for the pleasures of the Sun. Still art thou there, like the emptiness a whirlpool Furiously encompasses, O indestructible Emptiness! Only the communion of silence Fills thee, and light that the evening dims not. O naked Hermit, seated in thy mystery Of patience, gazing down the ruin of Time, Thou to the ravaging forest that rejoices To teem and perish, perish and teem again, Thou art no more than a fallen fragment of stone Only to be seized by the implacable fibres, Lifeless, without share in the green upsurging That streams about thee and climbs above thy head. But to thee, dipt into a central stillness, All this enormity of violent abundance, All the strength of the serpent-roots, and the wild Energy leaping into boughs and leaves, Are but obstructing shadow and apparition, Vapours ascending from vain desires of Time, Drawn as a mist is drawn from the wandering rivers, The stream into the cloud, and the cloud into the stream. But from what desire, O Solitary, dost thou come? From what seed sown in the abysses of the stars Was the strong engendering of the passion of thy stillness, Desire surpassing all the desires of mortals, Secret in the anchored body's immense surrender, A strange, transforming vision, a strange excess, Prisoned in the heart's beat, and out of its prison Crying to the glory of the Universal Sun? INHERITANCE I To a bare blue hill Wings an old thought roaming, At a random touch Of memory homing. The first of England These eyes to fill Was the lifted head Of that proud hill As lion-fronted Alone it warded The vale, and the far Bright West regarded. Who knows what wells Are a child's unthinking Eyes? What skies Thro' the clear of them sinking Have for ever coloured A mind that springs From buried hope, dumb prayer, Prized small things Precious to dust that once Throbbed in hearts, now Crumbled, where ignorant Passes the plough? II I have walked by streams In shadowy places Where wild-rose June With the moon embraces, And smelt the magic Of dew-drenched herbs In a hush that trances, Delights, disturbs. I have roamed in a frail mist's Filtered gold The Downs, so cleanly And smooth and old. I know how the shower-light Touches gray spires In the slumbrous bosom Of the elmy shires; And lying on warm thyme Watched at the sheer Black cliff the grand wave Lunge and rear, When the whole Atlantic Amassed recoils And in indolent thunder Bursts and boils. I have followed the Romans' Wall that wound Over lone moors, leaving The Druid mound In the secret hills Where the lost race lies, Dreaming the dream That the world denies; A dream that the voices Of England have sung, That is born in the blood And the eyes of the young. III O English earth 'Mid the blown seas lying Green, green, When the birds come flying Out of the empty south To the old willow, Ash, thorn, chestnut— Boughs that they know— Sweet, sweet, sweet to be Back in May bowers When the grass grows tall Round the English flowers. O the light on tost clouds As you take to your breast Your stormy lover, The strong South-West, That breathes a wild whisper In youth's thrilled ear, Of strange things, of far things, Of glory and fear! But the things that are dearest You have told them never; They are deep in our veins For ever and ever; They come over the mind When the world's noise is still As to me comes the vision Of one blue hill, Beautiful, dark, And solitary, The first of England That spoke to me. GIFTS OF SILENCE No sound in all the mountains, all the sky! Yet hush! one delicate sound, minutely clear, Makes the immense Silence draw more near,— Some secret ripple of running water, shy As a delight that hides from alien eye: And the encircling mountains seem an ear Only for this; the still clouds hang to hear All music in a sound small as a sigh. Far below rises to the horizon rim The silent sea. Above, those gray clouds pile; But through them tremblingly escape, like bloom, Like buds of beams, for sleepy mile on mile, Wellings of light, as if heaven had not room For the hidden glory and must overbrim. Penmaenmawr THULE Random rock And the stain of the rain, Smell of bracken, The windy moor And the wild cloud, And rising blurred In the showery gray A nameless mound Of the perished people Who built nothing,— Content I savour My Northern earth, Till memory's shuttle Darts across it A far picture; A little temple Long deserted Warming its honey-pale Gracious columns In the soft South. Remote the mountains In blue noon; Before the temple A spring bubbles In vivid grass. There once approaching To enter the sacred Dimness, youth Beheld gleaming The breasts of Venus; Vanished! only The morning sun Comes to the marble Warm as the touch Of youthful lips. Am I there, Where the vines redden Beneath white towers And dark the cypress Points aloof, Where Beauty brought forth Wondrous children To smile down Time And the passing, passing Trouble of the world? Or here, where rooted Ancient fibre Stirs to the wind And the blood in answer Deeply stirs; To the wind that smells Of ocean spray, That blows as the spirit Blows, and finds Upon earth no home? LYCABETTUS Lycabettus is the rocky pinnacle which dominates Athens on its eastern side. Lycabett at every steep street's ending Is there Surprising the eyes, and ascending Aloof, pointed bare Into the bluest blue That ever the live light Poured pulsing through. O spiring, tawny-caverned, crested white, Pine-skirted Lycabett! Lifting above spread roofs this craggy height, What have you to do With the sprawled city's modern swarm and hum, You that have seen the ages go and come From the first sun-rise to the last sun-set? When Athens wore her wondrous bloom, Her dateless violet, You had no ornament nor dress; And who had eyes for you?— Wild earth, rude rock, What history? Only solitariness. WINDOWS AT CHARTRES Spiritual colour in dimness angel-high, The very Light made flesh! It is as though Blood throbbed and blanched and fired to feel the flow Of thought within the veins, or ecstasy Live in one still drop. What leaf's juice could dye That clear, clear green of paradise, what glow Within the vine's black purples deepen so, Meshed in the blue of coldly-burning sky? Light for its crystal body has put on Unearthly glory of verdure and of air At dawn, and bright in mystery the flame As of a heart eternal pulsing there. O, earth and sky were needing a new name When I came out into the simple sun. HISTORY Time has stored all, but keeps his chronicle In secret, beyond all our probe or gauge. There flows the human story, vast and full; And here a muddy trickle smears the page. The things our hearts remember make a sound So faint; so loud the menace and applause. The gleaners come, with eyes upon the ground After Oblivion's harvest, picking straws. What is man, if this only has told his tale, For whom ruin and blunder mark the years, Whom continent-shadowing conquerors regale To surfeiting, with glory of blood and tears? He flaunts his folly and woe in a proud dress: But writes no history of his happiness. STRAY SEED A far look in absorbed eyes, unaware Of what some gazer thrills to gather there; Happy voice, singing to itself apart, That pulses new blood through a listener's heart; Bowed fortitude; and in an hour of dread The scorn of all odds in a proud young head: These are themselves, and being but what they are, Of others' praise or pity have no care; Yet still are magnets to an unknown need. Invisible as the wind, sowing stray seed, Life breathes on life, ignorant what it brings, And spirit touches spirit on the strings Where music is; courage from courage glows; Shy powers in secret to themselves unclose; And unbefriended hope in the cold dark Nursing its patient solitary spark Among the ashes of a world to-day Will be to-morrow kindled far away In young bosoms. O we have failed and failed And never known if we or the world ailed, Clouded and thwarted; yet perhaps the best Of all we have done and dreamed of lives unguessed. WHEN I AM ONLY I When I am only I, The secret battle-ground Of world and will, wherein Self is so strictly bound, Then am I condemned; Then can I understand The heart crumbling to dust And the eyes stopt with sand. But when, self fallen asleep, Quickens through all my veins The entrancing light, and stream The rivers and the rains, Though to the wondrous earth The tendril senses cling And amid living leaves I, as a bird, sing. The breath comes of a world Beyond all human moan. There I am lost, and there I am come into mine own. GOSSAMERS In the breathing of a breath— How, who shall say? Ghostly mist has flowered Into flaming day. Dewy from furze to furze Gossamers are spun, Frail forgotten threads Of moonshine in the sun. As I stray, I stop; And suddenly I seem With all I am on earth To have become a dream, And mingle with the dreams Wandering silent air Out of the souls of men, None knows nor guesses where. No human voice is heard; Yet the air is full, full Of sighs, desires, and want, And hope invisible. Each thinks to be alone; Yet separate is none. Of such a quivering web The human soul is spun. Loose as the idle clouds My thoughts float as they may. Now I am here, and now Ten thousand miles away. THE JUNIPERS Gray the slow sky darkens Over the downland track Where the long valley closes Under a smooth hill's back. The slope is darkly sprinkled With ancient junipers, Each a small, secret tree: There not a breath stirs. I fear those waiting shapes Of wry, blue-berried wood. They make a twilight in my mind, As if they drained my blood, As if a spirit were prisoned Within each writhen stem, And no one knows their kindred Nor what frustrated them. Along the empty valley Like a ghost go I; My footsteps and my beating heart Nothing signify, Lost into nameless ages That come, slow cloud on cloud, From history's beginning And all the future shroud. MAY MORNING Over all the watered vale Shadows of the clouds trail: Then the sun laughs out, and sheen Runs like joy across the green. Young the leaf is, young the flower; Radiant the beeches tower, A million tremblings all as one Dancing forth into the sun. Above the sound of hidden brooks Birds sprinkle songs on coppice-nooks, Each his private happy note, With small bright eye and rippled throat. England, through whose fields I stray In this heavenly-coloured May, England, lost in histories Older than her oldest trees, With nested hamlets, each of them Flavoured like its ancient name; England, where my blood began And moulded childhood into man, Comes to-day before my eyes Like a new-found paradise. Yet I wonder not at this Wonder, that is half of bliss. I have looked into Love's eyes Long, and Love has made me wise. As when first one face I knew And our lips together drew, Old in love, my heart to-day Is young as the young leaves of May. Toller Porcorum A COLLOQUY Why hurt so hard by little pricks, By chasing cares so clouded over, Heart of mine? Holding what no storm can unfix Nor time corrupt, O tender lover! Why repine? In you so deep a fountain springs Of faith and joy beyond all speech, O happy heart! How should those meanly thwarting things Men do, the petty creeds they preach, In you have part? It is because, my heart replies, There is such beauty to adore Within, for ever,— Because I dwell in paradise, That the world's chafing is a sore, A fret, a fever. Were there no fountain welling strong In me, no vision heavenly-rare Before my eyes, There'd be for me no world of wrong Without, lamenting to compare With paradise. WHEN ALL THE WORLD IS HIDDEN When all the world is hidden And there is only you, When bosom beats to bosom As if the heart broke through, O never speech nor language Song nor music told The wonder more than all the world That in my arms I hold. Day is a dream abolished, Sweet madness only true. The night is burning beauty Where there is only you. AUTUMN SONG All is wild with change, Large the yellow leaves Hang, so frail and few. Now they go, they too Flutter, lifted, lying, Everywhither strewn. All is wild with change. Nothing shrinks or grieves. There's no time for sighing. Night comes fast on noon, Dawn treads after soon; Days are springing, dying, We with them are flying. All is wild with change. LOVERS Stars beyond number or imagination Silent in the sky; Shadowy valleys and dark woods over them, Still, without a sigh; A house, lost in vastness and in silence, With no house nigh; A room apart, with not a whisper in it As the hours steal by: Sleeping in our star-surrounded darkness, You and I. THE WAY HOME Many dreams I have dreamed That are all now gone. The world, mirrored in a dark pool, How unearthly it shone! But now I have comfort From the things that are, Nor shrink too ashamed from the self That to self is bare. More than soft clouds of leaf I like the stark form Of the tree standing up without mask In stillness and storm, Poverty in the grain, Warp, gnarl, exposed, Nothing of nature's fault or the years' Slow injury glozed. From the thing that is My comfort is come. Wind washes the plain road: This is the way home. SHELLEY'S PYRE Written for choric and solo speaking. Performed at the Oxford Festival of Spoken Poetry, July, 1938, by Dulcie Bowie, Gwynneth Thurburn, Nancy Brown, and Helena Moore The Spirit of Earth, robed in green; The Spirit of Air, robed in blue; The Spirit of Water, robed in silver; The Spirit of Fire, robed in red. Each steps forward in turn. Spirit of Earth I am the Spirit of Earth. Spirit of Air I am the Spirit of Air. Spirit of Water I am the Spirit of Water. Spirit of Fire I am the Spirit of Fire. All [together] This is the shore of the sea. Stillness and hot noon; Stillness after storm. The sun scorches the sand. On the sand of the sea is a pyre: On the pyre a young man's body, White and naked, Spirit of Earth A child of Earth, Spirit of Water Out of the sea he is come Spirit of Earth To the last shore. All Ringed with flames this body lies; flames shining, flames entwining, Spirit of Fire Vaulting, Spirit of Air Assaulting, Spirit of Fire Dancing, All Lancing On the noon intenser light, Branding on the air a fierier fire. Spirit of Water The slow sea-ripple sparkles up the sand. All Afar the mountains look down on the land. Spirit of Air He was swiftness. Spirit of Earth He is still. Spirit of Water A wave breaking; a wave broken. At the sea's will. All His eyes drank of the world's beauty; His eyes wept for the world's wrong. Spirit of Fire His eyes shine on the world no more. All Out of his mouth came forth song, Wondering, trembling, triumphing, lamenting. Spirit of Earth His mouth will utter songs no more. All A Power breathed, a Power filled, a Power kindled and made strong The heart this mortal throbbed with. O whence came it? O whence came Power to frailty, hope to anguish? He was swift and he was strange, Swift as stream, swift as wind; strange to all he came among. Spirit of Fire Leap, my flames! tower and quiver! All So into the world he came. Spirit of Fire No wind blows, the fire to bend. It springs right upward to the sun. Mount, my flames, ascend, ascend! Spirit of Earth Out of me this spirit rose, His cradle green and sleepy earth; A seed sown in a chance place, Where-from, who knows? Yet from my womb was his birth. Spirit of Water He was my lover. In river and sea He plunged his body; his ardour flowed With the flow of the streams, and the rain and the cloud. Now I have rendered up my lover. Spirit of Fire Higher, higher, higher In wild dishevelled blaze Single plumes of light aspire To be lost in the noon's haze. All These flames are your thoughts, these fires your desires, O Mortal! Speeding before you, as you, the far forerunner Outstript, O spirit arrayed in the sanguine colour Of cloud at dawn, the laggard, the lulled and dulled, Announcing a dawn too dazzling for your kind. Spirit of Fire You left them behind! All And winged in a radiant mist of love, you flew Onward, alone: not on earth was a home for you, Where men oppressed and trafficked, and hope was foiled, Soiled, despoiled! Yet hope was the breath you drew. Spirit of Air The white body is changing: it has taken the swift shape Of fire, and the fire passes, dazzling the noon, Shedding all but swiftness and the ecstasy of flight, Of the light into light. Spirit of Fire Sink my flames! Spirit of Water As a falling fountain The flames sink down, Spirit of Earth But the heart remains Unconsumed; it is mine in earth. All Out of the fire, O spirit, come forth To us, who have been from the beginning. Bond by bond, chain by chain, Our hands are untwisting what bound you; we free you, Release you from Time And the harsh taste of the cold world, Custom, calumny, ignorance, pain. Come away! Noon is silent in heat that trembles, Silent the sea that took you, and all the winds, Silent the shadowy mountains; they look down; And the stars that are known but in darkness to men, They also, the true stars. They are the silence; you the voice! And the voice soars upward, singing, From where the sparks expire And the embers of fire darken, A fountain cascading in drops as of light, Flowing over, invading the silence, in joy to be free. It ascends in its radiance, singing, singing; and we, We hearken. THE END</field>
