      <field name="fulltext">THE GODDESS OF POVERTY From the Countess of Rudolstadt by George Sand. Gold-sanded paths! and verdant heathy ground! Ravines by the chamois loved! And ye, grand mountains, constellation-crown'd! Ye wandering torrents! forest-depths unproved! Let the Good Goddess pass, The Goddess of Poverty! Since the world's life, since men came on the earth, The world she traverseth; She dwelleth among men, she poureth forth Her travel-song, or singing laboureth: The Goddess of Poverty. Some, met to crush her, found her far too fair, Too agile, strong, and gay; âTear off her wings, enchain her, let her bear âBlows that shall crush her, till she die away,â The Goddess of Poverty.â They persecuted her, they beat and chain'd,â But never could debase; The poet's, peasant's, artist's soul remain'd,â The saint's, the martyr's soul, thy refuge-place: Goddess of Poverty! More hath she wander'd than the Wandering Jew, Than the swallow voyagÃ¨d; Older than Prague's cathedral, yet more new Than the egg o' the wren, more o'er the wide earth spread Than strawberries on the Boehmer-Wald is she,â The Goddess of Poverty. She hath had children many beyond count, God's secret them hath taught; She spoke to the heart of Jesus on the Mount, To the eyes of the Queen Libussa as they sought The Labourer, to John and Jerome's soul On Constance' funeral pyre; more than the whole Of the doctors and the bishops knoweth she: The Goddess of Poverty. The grandest and the fairest things one sees Upon the earth are hers; She cultivates the soil, and prunes the trees, And leads the flocks with music of sweet airs; The first dawn-peep, the first sun-smile she wears: The Goddess of Poverty. She builds the woodman's hut of the green bough, And gives the eagle eye Unto the poacher, rears the young ones high, And lightens for old hands the spade and plough; The Goddess of Poverty. 'Tis she inspires the poet; she who renders The vagabond's flute divine, And from the Moldau's to the Danube's source Bears him with light-wing'd force, Crowning his hair with dew-pearls, making shine The stars for him with larger, clearer splendours: The Goddess of Poverty. She teacheth to the artisan his gear, To fashion stone and steel; She makes the thread supple and fine as hair On the old mother's and the young girl's wheel: The Goddess of Poverty. She holds the thatch'd hut shaken by the storm, The torch and lamp maintains; She kneads the household bread, and weaves the warm And the cool vestments; feeds, and all sustains; The Goddess of Poverty. She built great castles and cathedrals old; She bears both sword and gun, Makes war and conquest, gathers death's wide fold, Cares for the wounded, hides the vanquish'd one: The Goddess of Poverty. Thou art all mildness, patience, power to cope, And pitying heart is thine; Giving them charity and faith and hope, Thou link'st thy children with a love divine: Goddess of Poverty! Their shoulders yet shall rest from the world-load, Their labour-pain made worth; Nor rich nor poor be in the coming times, When all men shall possess the fruits of earth And equally enjoy the gifts of God. Thou wilt not be forgotten in their hymns, Goddess of Poverty! Their mother and their nurse robust thou wast, And their church-militant: They will pour balm upon thy wounds and haste That the fresh balmy earth may rest thy want: Goddess of Poverty! Ere the Day o' the Lord shall come, torrents and woods! Ye mountains and ye vales! Heaths with your bird and flower multitudes! Gold-sanded paths o'er which no king prevails! Let the Good Goddess pass, The Goddess of Poverty! ODE TO YOUTH [From the Polish of Adam Mickiewicz.] Opeoples! heartless, soulless skeletons!â O Youth! give me thy wings, That I may mount aloft from this dead earth And soar to where Enthusiasm flings Its light on nobler things, Waking new blossoms of most wondrous worth And blessing Hope with dreams of her belovÃ¨d ones. For him whose sight is nigh eclipsed by age, Whose wrinkled brow is bow'd unto the ground, Be his pale vision's bound The scant horizon of a measured page! But Youth! thy vigourous sight Should leap beyond the earth, and sun-like wend Thorough the path of life, from height to height, From end to end. Look down! on yonder chaos, whose dark girth Is wrapp'd in sluggishness as in a fog: It is the earth. Lo where on that dead ocean, like a log, Floats some strange reptile shell'd in shapeless rind, Itself its ship, its pilot, and its helm,â Feeding on what less reptiles it can find, Now on the wave-top, now deep in the whelm, All heedless of the unheeding tempest's shock. Now bubble-like it bursts against a rock: And no one of its life or burial wist. It is the Egotist. Youth! the nectar of my life Is only sweet when it it shared with others. Let friendship's golden thread enlink you, brothers! And heaven-joys shall in your hearts be rife. Together, then, young friends! Each one is happy in united ends And strong, and in enthusiasm wise. Together, then, young friends! Nor is he hapless who nears not the aim. Enthusiasm leading him, he dies, In mid career struck down; his brethren rise O'er him, as on a stair, toward eternal fame. Together, then, young friends! Though steep and slippery be the path, Though Violence or Weakness you prevent: Let Wrath be vanquish'd by diviner Wrath, And wrestle in youth with Weakness till her charms are spent! Who could with baby hands the serpents quell Can grapple with the centaur in his prime; Will bring back victims from the throat of Hell, And reach at last to Heaven's wreath sublime. So reach thou far beyond the grasp of sight! Burst through what thy mere reason can not pierce! Youth! be thy soaring like the eagle's flight; Thy arm a thunderbolt, so swift and fierce. Hurrah! foot set to foot, with mighty hands Our arms shall bind the sphere, Our thoughts concentre here; Our souls one will commands. We'll tear this lump of earth from its deep base, And push the sluggard on a newer track; Rend off its mouldy rind, and give it back Its spring of life, fresh as our youthful grace. Over dark chaos and the void of eld, Confusion with confusion wildly blent, God's Word forth went: And lo, the worlds appear'd, in space upheld. Shouted the hurricane, the waters leap'd, And myriad stars the heavens in splendour steep'd: So in the nations' hearts is darkness now,â Will, like the elements, with will contending: But the divinity of Youth its brow Uplifts, and lo, the agony is ending. The new world issues from the gloom: With Love henceforth upon its bright path wending, And by Love's power upheld through the eternal doom. Light driveth down the sky the cloudy wrack Of error; feeling bursts its icy bar. Welcome, thrice welcome, Freedom's Morning Star! The Saviour Sun close follows on thy track. LOVE'S SHADOW I loved, gave body and soul for dower, Then he flung me from his heart. What else? he had gather'd and worn the flower. Let it fall! and so depart. I was a loved and duteous wife, The wife of a worthy lord: O, never worthier, nobler life Deserved to be adored. But I,âI daily, nightly pray'd, As the loving need not pray: Dear God! vouchsafe to me thine aid To be true to him alway. And he I loved was my husband's friend. I never loved man but him. That passionate heaven so low did bend My wifely eyes grew dim. Under the porch I stood alone As through the limes he came: Or ever his hand had touch'd my own My blood was boiling flame. O God, to lie on a loving breast, Unable to make return! And O for the fire that knows no rest, That burneth, and aye must burn! Or ever his breath had woo'd my cheek, Why doth the Lady blush? Or ever his love had time to speak My life toward him did rush. Under the gnarled oaken boughs, On a grey moss'd stone we sate; Silent were both: what need of vows In the presence of Love and Fate? It was but two or three days at most He came, scarce spoke, and went: The very sun was a mooned ghost In the dreary firmament. And daily, nightly, ever I pray'd: Great need was now to pray: O Truth! vouchsafe to me thine aid, Lest I should fall away. Again, in the hot and sultry June, The Presence is at my gate; And my pulses throb to a lofty tune, And my heart is all elate. For I will love him and do no wrong: O Truth! upstay me now! Thou and I, BelovÃ¨d! are strong:â His lips were on my brow. And so, weak heart! be brave awhile; Parch'd lips! hope not to kiss. I met my lord with a loyal smile; But my soul was none of his. âTake her and love her more than I!â For ruth I could not move:â How I long'd to kiss him tenderly, The man I did not love. Take her! And wherefore didst thou take? My joy hath made me blind. Love! I have left him for thy sake: What welcome shall I find? Or ever grey autumn bronzed the leaves, Poor Hope, that doubted ne'er, Was cowering under her palace eaves: The winds play'd with her hair. Mockingly then the Loved laugh'd out: âMy Beautiful! be content; âYes, I do worship thee, past all doubt, âBut a Wife I never meant. âSummer hath many a warm day yet; âEver must love be free.â Carelessly laugh'd he,ââCheeks tear-wet âWill grow too pale for me.â Had he tired, his love been cold or dull, Had desire been satisfied,â But a flower for my lord Caprice to cull And then to fling aside! Or he loved another: but far, far worse, The doom he brought me nigh,â The sorrow, the shame, the clinging curse Of loving unworthily. LovingâO more than heaven above; And to feel that all return Is the low desire which is not love,â A âloveâ which can seek and spurn. Scornfully laugh'd he as I went: âWhat wouldst thou have? Sweet Life! âLittle matters for love's content âThat empty name of Wife.â So a year pass'd by, and we two ne'er met; And I tried to loathe his name; And no one cared for the cheeks tear-wet But the one I would not claim. A long long year. And then again We two were side by side. By the death-bed of my lord we twain Were watching, till he died. Then love's dark hate pass'd out of me, And I pray'd again: True Heart! Love me and wed me. âLove is free,â He answer'd: âWe will part.â Scornfully laugh'd he as he wentâ âTis better we part, Sweet Life! âThou wouldst hardly be more content âEven with the name of Wife.â Ere I look'd through the mist of tears He, the BelovÃ¨d, was gone. How could I meet my widow'd years, Unlovely and alone? Then Love stood manifest in Wrath: I cursed him franticly; And slipp'd the Avenger on his path:â Who could avenge but I? And step by step I follow'd him, I track'd him everywhere; In vain he hid,âthe tigress grim Could never miss her lair. Daily and nightly, his gate before, I lean'd at the lintel-postâ O never, never I loved him more Thau when I hated most. At length we met. And gaze for gaze. He laugh'd, but his voice was kind: The full rich voice of the summer days, Till I grew sick and blind And dizzy in Love's great glare of light. Then fell Love's ShadowâHate: And ere the cloud had left my sight The Man, the Loved, my life's delight, Lay dead at his own gate. TARQUIN THE PROUD Rejoicing in imperiousness of will, Sits Tarquin. One allow'd Enters his presence; standeth proudly still Before âThe Proud.â The Sybil standeth there before the King, Waiting his question. Heâ What wantest thou, and wherefore dost thou bring Those books to me? To sell them to thee, Tarquin! They are dear. If thou wilt have them, say! Quick as his âNo!â the form doth disappear, Too proud to stay. But after a brief while she comes again, WithâI have burn'd a third. At the same price the other six remain: Againâthy word? No! says the haughty King: too large the sum. And laugheth at the thought. Again she leaveth, even as she did come,â Unstay'd, unsought. And yet a third time comes she to the King. Tarquin the Proud is wroth. What are these books thou wilt persist to bring To me, so loath? Angry, but moved by unaccustom'd fear, Tarquin bows to her will, And takes the remnant, although trebly dear,â Haughtily still. Now tell me, Augurs! what delay hath lost! O King! thou shouldst have bought. Even these are worth far more than all their cost, So treasure-fraught. These books contain of good and ill to Rome The certain prophecy, And all the weal or woe to thine own house That draweth nigh. Lay them in Jove's own temple, under guard! Too late, too late to find The lost and the refused, the high reward Thou wouldst not mind. Tarquin the Proud hath perish'd in his pride, Who grudged the price to learn. He sought the Sybil. Never till he died Did she return. QUESTIONING IâTHE PARIAH Outcast,âand bad,âI dare say you are right. I am a villain, viler than you think. I've done most things men say are wickedness, And not much cared to set myself to square With what you call commandments. I had strength, And will and appetite,âa lusty man Even from my youth,âcould eat and could enjoy, And never chose to give enjoyment up For stupid sacrifice or love of God. I loved my wenchings more, and plenty of meat, And drink that made me almost like a godâ Even if it sometimes made a fool of me. Commandments! I cared nothing for command; But liked to live, and lived most as I liked. I ate and drank. When I was short of food, I stole it. Was not that my natural right? And your rich folk had only stolen from me. What is a man if he may not eat and drink, And kiss his woman? O, when life was young I had my time of it. Now I grow old, I am no humbug to repent and whine. But there are other things. Of course there are. Trees grow, have higher branches and more leaves. There's nought I'll take the trouble to deny. Why should I? Shame and I have never met. Shame is a decently dress'd and pretty maid, Brought up in a Sunday School, and kept in-doors By a good mistress, and not fed too high For fear her parish cheeks get too much blood And tempt some sinner as she crawls from church In the summer evenings. I'd not watch for such. I'd scarcely turn my head to look at her, Even though I lay in the grass not half asleep While she pass'd by with hymn-book under arm, Looking demurely down upon her gloves. There was no one like Shame I ever knew: I kept no company with such as She. Red cheeks with rich blood in them, full thick lips That ask'd to be bitten, limbs as firm as mine: I thought these better than your modesties. We were wild beasts then, and we liked it well. But there were other thingsâyou said just now. I am not for denial. I'm not shamed. I have had blood upon my hands. What then? I wash'd it off. The man had injured me. I heard the other day a gentleman Shot down his friend for something he had done, Or something he had only said of him: I mind not what. Why should not I the same? A knife was handier, and a deal more sure. Done in hot bloodâyour gentleman in cold! I've done that too: but it was self-defence. I had as good a right to fish as they; Better, for I was hungry, well nigh starved. I was not fond too of inside the jail. So, when he laid his hand upon my wrist, I put my other hand up to his throat, Tripping him with a quick heel. 'Twas no use To let him up again. I made an end, And sent him down the stream to fish for himself. I have kill'd others too that stood in my way,â And got no medals for it, soldier-like. They were my enemies: shall not I fight for myself As well as for the State that casts me out? Yes! I broke laws, a plenty. Some of you Are paid for keeping them. If not, perhapsâ I don't much heed laws, and I never did. I was not bred to the fashion. From a boy I have been taught quite other sort of work. Who makes your laws? I know not, but I know They bite like wolves' teeth into my free will. Why shonld I heed them? Tell you, I do not. I'll drink, wench, poach, and steal, while I have strength; And when that failsâthen you may pray for me. Much good may it do me when I've lost my teeth. Still I am sorry for one thing I did: When I play'd false to one who trusted me, And who was true and more than kind, poor soul! I saw some one I fancied more for the time. She was a fool ever to find it out. But what did it matter? She was none the worse. I'd not have liked her though at the same game. Perhaps she was no better than myself. There's no good now in thinking over that.â I tell you, Parson! I'm too stiff to kneel. Who was Saint Simon? Stuck himself atop Of a great pillarâso I have been toldâ That men might see his utter filthiness. I am a saint too, standing very high On my own chosen perch of villainy. But did I choose it? Say the Devil chose. The Devil indeed! You parsons talk of him Like an old friend. Your Devil is so like God I don't know one from the other. Do I know There's either? May be there is only one,â âGodâ for you rich men, âDevilâ for us poor. Well then, the Devil or God, no matter which, Has made a saint of me. Of a queer sort? Not queerer than Saint Simon. Look you now! Just see, my masters! I am as good as he: May be almost as dirty, and full of sores Inside and out, not more of sores than sins: A thief, a lecher, and a murderer too; And took my pleasures without caring where, Or how, or who was worse for what I took. Was I much worse than most of other men? I have done just what a lusty fellow would: Reap'd the world wide and eaten of the best,â The best within my reach, at any rate. How do I know but that the Lord mean'd this, And I've been doing his work at his own wage? Not too good pay for all I have gone through. I've not been one of the prosperous of the earth, Nor known much of fine linen, purple robes, Lolling in carriages or on soft beds. Yet I had appetites. I am a man. Shall I have less than any beastly swine? The Lord not liking, why did he make me so? Besides, I mind me that you spoke but now Of a people who were used to drench their slaves So their mad pranks might warn the masters' sons From drinking. May be I'm a saint for that: A chosen vessel to put vileness in That better folk may see the worst o' the bad And so keep better,âfor the flesh is weak. Let me alone! What can you do with me? Show me to naughty boys to make them good? I'm a fine scarecrow. Tell you, I'm a saint: Saint Simon,âor more like Saint Lazarus, With sins for sores. You dumb dogs lick at them As if you liked the job of curing me. Another of your stories! How do you know I am not set in the dirt to grow for heaven: A flower for Abraham's bosom some fine day? Here's your health, Parson! and more luck to you. IIâTHE PARSON First sin, and then the Judgment. It is so. Father and God! how came this man to sin? How may I medicine his agony? What shall I do to help the Impenitent? Shall I condemn, or shall I speak of peace? What peace for sin? what peace to the depraved? What peace before the threatenings of thy wrath? Are these Thy martyrs? God! Even at the stake, Before the strangling smoke can ease his pains, Or underneath the pile of crushing stones, The Saint upraises his exultant hymn; Upon the battle-field, too proud to flee, Or in the last ditch of a long defeat, Or on the scaffold drench'd with noblest blood, The hero and the patriot smiling falls, Passing to Thee with triumph on his brows, Knowing the future harvest of his loss; The good physician, the yet tenderer nurse, Struck down beside the dying or the saved;â All who for Truth or for the common weal Have given or risk'd their lives, all these we know: The glorious army of the Sacrificed, Thy saints, Thy chosen, who shall reign with Thee, Their glory as eternal as their worth. The sufferer who has borne disease or griefâ A daily task from Theeâwithout complaint; The beggar Thou translatest up to heaven, For he was rich in patience; and the poor, Who knew not, had not, and yet sinn'd not, good In spite of ignorance: we know them too: The kingdom of heaven is of such as these. Surely they are not martyrs, all of whom Pass crowned conquerors through the gates of love. The sinning are Thy martyrs, Father! Thou SeÃ«st them too. Since not a sparrow falls Unnoticed or unorder'd of Thy Will. Thou dost not order sin. For is not sin Itself disorder? Yet disease is Thine. And vice is but disease of mind or will: Poorness or imbecility of soul. If Thou dost order it, it must be good: And imbecility may be forgiven, And poorness led to wealth, nor always left Outside the porch of Thy benevolence. Why thenâthe saint and sinner are alike In Thy esteem: the righteous and the knave: The rain of Thy compassion falls on both. The cripple climbeth to the angel's place; Thou liftest up the loathsome to Thy side, Not reckoning as wrong what wrought Thy will. And truly, if these wretches enter heaven, Good deeds and faith have but an equal claim, Our righteousness is but as filthy rags, And saintly Dives sups with Lazarus. Shall we then envy Wrong and doubt of Right? Is Evil then all pleasant? and is Good Only a travail, painful, and in vain? Not so! not so! Although Thy heaven were not, Evil and Good are their own sure reward. Sin yet remaineth sin; and vice is vice,â The parent of unhappiness and shame, Weakness, and fear, and heathenish despairâ When not debased to very brutishness. Right is even here the lord of higher joy Than ever the voluptuary knew. Take every pleasure sense and will exchange, Even in the heyday of their hottest blood, And one pure thought of duty fairly doneâ Whatever be the cost to life or hopeâ Outweighs it all. Is holiness so poor, Or man's best heritage so little worth, The prodigal is envied for his husks? We thank Thee, God! we know that Thou art just. And yet the piteous question cometh back: How came this man to sin? Born, bred in it: His parents evil livers like himself: Lustful and lawless, vilely unrestrain'd, All better impulses were so o'ergrown And overshadow'd like good herbs by weeds And poisonous trees, until the garden-ground Became a wilderness weed-choked and cursed: Cursed for his parents' sins as they for theirs; Cursed for that Evil came into the world,â Evil of weakness, of disease, of death, Of all that hinders strength of healthy growth,â Evilâthe worm that dieth not. Alas! So was he cursed: though God is merciful. I travel round unto my grief again: The sorrow of sorrows,âfor that there is ill,â Our ill, though all be very good with Thee,â Illâlove is yet too weak to remedy, Illâwhich our hope dares hardly look upon, Illâthat even faith can but behold through tears. All-loving One! Thy Lazarus is dead: Bound with the grave-cloths, laid within the tomb. Forgive the impatience praying for Thy Wordâ âNot dead, but sleeping: Lazarus! come forth.â MAHMOUD'S FLIGHT Only with water-gourd and dates for food, Mahmoud is in the Desert, to evade The enemy who may not be withstood, Fleeing dismay'd. Night after night the warning voice had cried, âThe Sultan's Vanquisher is on his way!â The unknown danger not to be defied Bred his dismay. His women and his palaces are left: âAll a man hath he for his skin will give.â Nay! would he care although of skin bereft, So he might live? But whither flee? To some far distant land Where none have heard of his world-reaching fame, Where none his proclamations understand Or know his name. Far, far in the Desert! Let the camel take His way unguided, with the rein on neck, With wide foot-prints,âthe swift sand hides the wake; The merest speck, Not man and camel, but a point scarce seen, Lost soon as seen, is all the horizon shows. Safe is he even as if he ne'er had been Afraid of foes. And now the rein may tighten: past the might Of ill however closely it pursue. There is no track upon the star-lit night, No fear in view. Rest for the night! But in the night his fear Wakens and bids him farther from the foe. What if through accident he draweth near? How can one know? So on, yet on, rest not for night or day, While the last strain of sinew bears him through. On, on, pursue the solitary way, Though none pursue! So hastening tow'rd the safely distant land Beyond o'ertaking, he one evening meets A poor lorn wretch who crouching in the sand Him humbly greets. A poor weak failing wretch, so weak, so poor, 'Twere worse than shame to pass such wretched one,â Though the gourd empty is and all the store Of dates is gone. Mahmoud alighteth. âI have nought for thee.â He looketh up and answerethââIt is said. What hast thou for thyself? Why come to me?â Then bows his head. Bow'd down, he wraps him in his mantle-folds, Maketh no sign, nor other word he saith. Mahmoud sinks down beside himâand beholds The face of Death. Far, far into the Desert he had fled To avoid the Unavoidable: and there They sit in the sand togetherâdead with dead, Death and Despair. NIGHT AND MORNING NIGHTâ Now is the house asleep, and I may climb To my hope's heaven. You are trembling, Love! âMy maid lies in the chamber next to mine, And she sleeps lightly. âShe will never hear Our kisses. âWhat if she were sick, or fear'd, And came to seek me, lying in your arms? It may not be. I dare not. What is that? âA mouse in the wainscot. There's no need of fear. When may this fortunate hour return again? Your husband absent, none suspecting us. Kiss me again, and come! Is this your tryst? âMy tryst! There was another trysting-time He trusts me still, and I: I loved him once. I thought so, till you came. âBut now your love Is mine. âAnd should you change as I have done. My God! I who am false. You'ld have me so? âNot false, but true unto the higher truth, Your love for me: your heart's truth known at last. âI dare not. O, I dare not. Say good night! And leave me! âDid you appoint me but for this? Nay! but we part not so. âI will call out. âAnd tell the household what hath frighted you? Tell the occasion made to fetch me here, And of our yet moist kisses? Say, so far You ventured, found it pleasant; on the brink (Good husband will not mind that) you drew back, Fearing the deeper current? âYou are hard. âAs you who loving would deny your love. You love me. The swift hour asks why we wait. âYou would not force me? âYou miscall it force When love at heart consents. I would but spare Your timorous conscience, making mine the blame. âFor honour, if you love me, let me pass! âYou have given yourself to me and you are mine, My own. Your love acknowledges my right. âI do not love you. He I loved was one Who lured me by his very nobleness: A king to claim allegiance. You are not The man I loved. You would lay shame on me For your vile pleasure. I could loathe you now. âIs it so? Then honour lift me up again To the former height! O thou BelovÃ¨d One! I would not wrong you. But your chamberlain: Not past your chamber door. And now, good night! â(As she throws herself on her bed,) And I do love him. God be merciful! MORNINGâ Return'd already? Sure, I thought to-day Given to fond epitaphs on joys self-slain. The inconvenient husband, was he home Too soon for moral lie-abeds? But say, How fares the fair Bianca? Lost in tears, Rain of Love's Morning after a close night? âAre you a gentleman? âWell, it may be. âI pray you then repeat no more her name Coupled with my desires. âShifts the wind so? Cupid! a most proud lover! Now, I'll bet She has jilted you at last. 'Tis so, 'tis so. A little dreg of virtue left in the flask, Has spoil'd a night-draught. She would yet will not. And hesitating, opportunity Has sent you back: the husband none the worse. âYou're slow to take my meaning. âSo, you ask Am I a gentleman? And your good friend. I would be sorry too, but your mishap You have not told me. Only by your looks, Which intimate you have not been quite in luck. Why, man! you can but try again and have. Another nightâ âI pray you, Sir! have done. A virtuous ladyâ âVery good, i' faith. A virtuous lady (most respectful phrase) Stays you in the antechamber of her hope. We know the angler's craft. âPeace! peace! your thought Is slanderous, false as Hell. That lady's soul Is spotless. âYou were disappointed then. Pshaw, man! she does but hold you off, the more To contemplate your longing. She is like The rest of them. âBy the All-living Truth, If you repeat that, I will write it false In your heart's blood. Draw, and defend yourself! âNot I, against a madman baulk'd in love. The woman's chaste because she bids him wait. Well, some of us are fools. I can but laugh. And so, Good-morning and next time more speed! TWO BROTHERS Unlucky man! whom Fortune not affects For all his courtship, though his keen respects Watch, like a faithful hound, before her gate, Waiting her coming forth both early and late. It is not every wooer wins her smile.â So it meseem'd when, on a certain while, Two Brothers treading were the self-same path: One born for favour, and one vow'd to wrath. And yet is Fortune not alone to blame: He well may miss the birds whose lower aim Marks only rabbits in the road-side grass. The equal sun-light entereth through the glass Or open door: who will put up his blind May not complain that he no warmth can find,â He would not when he might. Some seekers lose; But there are whose dull eyes the darkness choose. My tale shows partly this. I pray your leave. Some joy may be in it, not all to grieve. Upon a morn of Spring, when youthful blood Is restless and only to live seems good, These two I spake of pass'd upon their way. The younger one, hight Fridolin, was gay And carol'd as he went; and, light of foot, As prompt for motion as the mellow fruit Upon the bough when a wish brings it down, The ripe blood tingling in himâsole to crown, Ready of eye, and lithe in every limb, He went as all he met were glad of him. So debonair, and every motion grace, Even in the shade the sunlight lit his face, And the birds' songs for ever in his ears Pour'd musicâor he heard that of the spheres, So that his voice was tuneful as a girl's. His brow was shelter'd with brown crisped curls; And when he laugh'd he laugh'd both mouth and eye, Though both were firm if ill were lurking nigh; And quick his hand was and his footing sure. This bachelorâI trow no maid more pureâ Had Beauty's self to be his paramour: So great his gain of Nature, whose sweet power Had fill'd his veins with sentience of all good, In bower, or hall, or city, or green wood. Everywhere Gladness hasten'd to his side, Bold as a wife and trustful as a bride. And as he chirp'd and sang along the road, You felt a full heart was his only load. In the young golden buds he found delight And pleasure in the air, No anchorite Was he to hide content in his mind-cell; But some bright fancy ever had to tell In tones that made the hearer's pleasure more. And for the poor his pity bubbled o'er, As doth some way-side well o'erflow its brink When the hot traveler, halting, stoops to drink. The elder was for gainfulness and trade: He only cared how money might be made. He miss'd the skies; of flowers he had no heed, Seeing no worthâhe saidâin a mere weed, Unless he sold it as medicinal. A flower, it was a flower, and that was all. Colour was only colour; songs of birds To his conceit were but as empty words From some lame poet's scroll, and loss of time; He loathed to hear the woods' autumnal chime; Nor saw the stars, were winter nights most clear, Though much abroad. But then he had his cheer In a large profit; and sometimes could laugh, When subtle hints raised his percentage half. The only book he cared for was slate: He deem'd him wisest who could calculate, Carrying usury always in his head. The poor were but an idle lotâhe said; And for the weakâwell, each man had his load. His strength bore his own burthen, thanks to God, And other men had better shoulder theirs Than hinder neighbours by importunate prayers. Wealth welcomes him who did not waste his days A-wandering off the high road in vain ways Of pleasantness: he held the Preacher's sawâ That all was vanity; and as a law The parable of the Hid Talent kept, Planning new profit as he dreamily slept. He had great store of proverbs such as these:â Of early worms, and leaving grapes to freeze From lack of a due greedy diligence: For greed and thrift he call'd intelligence. No loiterer on idle ways was he; But with a shambling gait went hastily. Outstripping soon the cheerful wayfarer, He reach'd the forest edge, and entering there, Where the old oaks their antler boughs outspread, Counting some coined venture in his head, He heard the song of the axe, and inly thought, How much the sale had to the seller brought, And what the buyer's cost, and what his gain; And then it seem'd to him almost a pain Another but himself should so have reap'd. And so to a clear'd place he came where heap'd The naked limbs of the hewn trees were laid: A wild lone place, deep in the forest shade, Where round the fire the charcoal-burners stood, Leaning against the giants of the wood: Giants themselves, harsh-featured, muscular, Rude, and uncouth,âthe iron men who are Accusom'd to hard toil, sun-bronzed and grim, The Anakim of Labour. Seeing him, They moved to meet him, stepping in his path And one, more close, upon his shoulder hath Laid a strong hand and with rough action stay'd The startled man, wide-looking and dismay'd. But here retrace our course a little way, To tell what haps had usher'd in this day: Leaving our elder by the charcoal-pit, Foreseeing nought, and knowing not a whit Of what is in the swarthy burner's mind. Return we unto him who lagg'd behind! Our ladâthe younger of the brothers twainâ For honourable employment had been fain To serve as lady's page; as such had grown In years and grace, and favour,ânot alone With his dear mistress, but with her lord too, A knight whose worth was overmatch'd by few, Of prowess and great state, nor wanting wealth. Noting the boy so full of pith and health, He had him taught all necessary things Leading to knighthood, with intentionings Of more advancement; and the gentle dameâ Whose goodness perfect was as her good nameâ God wot, she loved him for his pretty ways And gentilesse, and for the many days He had made cheery with his scraps of song. The lady, soothly, had no thought of wrong; But, as a cloud comes in the clearest sky, So happen'd it: for lo there, by and by, The husband must grow jealous of the boy And hated him, and sought for his annoy; Until at length, his hate o'ermastering him And his sick vision making honour dim, He will'd to compass the lad's death, his fearâ So wicked men areâonly lest appear Proof of his guilt, still tender for his wife. Determined then to take the stripling's life, He sent him forth this morning; but before Sped word of doom. The evil message bore One whom he trusted in his worser mood. This one had yesterday been to the wood, And to the charcoal-burners gave commandâ âWho cometh first to-morrow to your hand, Treat him as though he were a stick of wood!â So when the elder came, they understood That this was he, their master's enemy, The man appointed on the morn to die; And made no pause, nor stay'd they to inquire, But seized the wretch and flung him on the fire, Heaping fresh logs on him. Again look back To Fridolin! who, following on his track Came singing on as blithe as any bird: As yet far off, so that he nothing heard Of the other's death-cry. Now beside the lake He stoop'd o'er some young may-fly scarce awake Clung to the stalk of an unopen'd bud; Or watch'd the small fry hiding in the mud Of their own hurrying; sometime he would fling A stone in the blue depths, or make it sing Leaping along the surface, child-like pleased With simplest playthings; then his song he ceased To steal upon and view the plaided snake Uncoil'd in the sunshine; or admired the brake With all its crook-like fronds, as if forgot By fairy shepherds fleeing from the spot At his approach (yet sure no fay nor elf Had fright of one as natural as itself); Now he pull'd down some honeysuckle bough, As yet with only green leaves on it; now Gladden'd his eyes with the rich purple tips Of the new oak-leaves; or put to his lips A curl'd up maple-leaf, as boys will do, Sending his breath melodiously through; Now counted nest eggs, with no thought of harm; Then ran and leapt; and as the day grew warm Unbutton'd to the cooler wind his vest, Giving to sight his smooth throat and fair breast, White as a maid'sâhe was so maiden fair And delicate-skinn'd. What sigh was on the air? Forsaken Dryad! didst thou see again Thy Rhaicos. and recall thy loving pain?â My master, Landor, sang of that so well, Methinks I do but stammer as I tell This later story. Take it for its truth, And listen to the end!âSo went the youth: Now on the road; one moment on the edge Of the broad water, seeking among the sedge Some painted worm; the next cast on the ground: And certes many lessons there he found, From curious creatures who were quick to tell, To him had sense to mind, their magic spell. So on his way he garner'd various lore, And of delights he got them by the score; And little sermons in Dame Nature's book Had time to read, open to those who look. Yet he stepp'd briskly onward, and ne'er lost Remembrance of his object, howso cross'd By thoughts and sights he wore as one may wear The flowers embroider'd on his robe, and bear Himself more proudly, but who will not stint Therefore his play of limb, less firmly print His foot in the road sand. And now he raught A winding height, and with new impulse sought The points of the wide landscape, miles of trees Mapp'd out before him, forest mysteries Crowding his soul with wonders; then anon Descended to the woodland depth, just gone By the elder; and so came in little while Unto the other's funeral pyre. His smile Was in its wonted place as he stepp'd in Among the burners, noting not the grin With which they welcomed him, supposing he Had been sent after that the doom might be Reported. He was known throughout these parts. And always welcome,âfor he won men's hearts With his first wordâofttimes before he spoke. There lounged or lay, beneath a centuried oak, The woodmen; round about was piled the yield Of the fell'd oak-trees, there all freshly peel'd For the sake of that strong bark the tanners use; And the big naked trunks, branch'd like to thews Of huge preAdamite monsters, fallen hard by, Look'd as if they might crawl away; and nigh To these were heaps of the small peeled boughs; And not far off the woodmen's turf-built house; And in the midst of all the charcoal pit, Smouldering, and charring all was thrown in it,â Nothing within its depth but blacken'd coal. May God forgive, and save that wretched soul! It was the noontide rest: the axe that swung So lately in the tree's heart, till it flung The ages' master to the sward, now lay Unused; the sturdy woodmen, some at play, Some at their meal, outstretch'd upon the grass, Gave greeting to the youth ere he could pass; And one of the burners rose, and pointing saidâ âThe will of the Lord his servants have obey'd.â The youth not understanding answer'd thenâ â'Tis well,â And, passing the unheeding men, Unwondering, went on his joyous way. God send him his deliverance every day EPITHALAMIUM Shine brightly, Sun! to greet this happy while: Shine brightly, Sun! maintaining old belief,â âHappy the Bride on whom the day doth smile.â Glad Time! make her ripe happiness the sheaf Of all her years! Her happiness: is it not his also? Are not they henceforth One for all the twain shall know Of good or ill, Of joy or woe, Of hope or fear? But Joy and Hope alone We now admit. Fear! be thou still; And Doubt! begone; Nor let your shadows stray Athwart the flower-strown way Of our young lovers, with triumphant feet Entering the porch of life's true perfectness! Hymen! we bid thee bless These votaries, and grant them full increase Of future joy and peaceâ A life complete. Fly hence, all Mischiefs that disturb the Home! Wrath and Contention! never venture here! False Double-tonguÃ¨dness! suspicious Fear! Avoid this door; nor even glance within! Vile Jealousy! let not your slime be seen On this clean threshold; nor Distrust begin To rot the roof-tree, gnawing there between The rafters!âBut thou hither come, Frank-spoken Faith! Love's handmaid! ever wait To keep the order'd house; nor lift the latch Nor ope the outmost gate For those unwelcomed! fairest Faith! attend The Married, as true servant and best friend! If Sorrow should approachâalas the hour! Come, thou not always enemy to man! Not in thy panoply of dreadful power, Storm-messaging, but, as God's Angel can, With that sad smile on thy unwilling lips Telling them only of an hour's eclipse Of the continual sun! Sit at their board, The while thou sojournest, A courteous stranger, and an honour'd guest! Brief be thy stay; And as thou passest, with some thanks away, A blessing thy last word! No more! we would not that a slightest shade Should soil the orange-blossoms' dainty white. Pure as those blooms be all your years, as bright Your life, fair Maid! Fair Maid no more, but fairer, happier Wife. O Wife! O Husband! bearing each a name More royal than the style of Queen or King,â When Time shall bring The higher Father-Mother-hood, Love's aim So reach'd, may ye In your like children see Your happiness repeated, and your worth, As years spring forth, Year following year with grander garnering! Now even you, Good Wishes! stand aside! The Bridegroom and the Bride Would be alone.â Atone With no less wishful silence, for rude speech! Utter but one more spellâ Heart-breathed from all and eachâ Fare well! LOVE-LORE [1887] Changeful as Proteus, vagrant as the air, Love has three names,âHope, Rapture, and Despair. PROLOGUE In the days when Earth was young Beauty had not found a tongue: For the Gods forbade her speech, Lest her voice too soon should teach All the bliss that Love bestows, All the lore that heaven knows. Through the bleak world wandering, Silent Beauty yet could bring Unto many an anxious thought Dreams of heaven, else untaught: Everywhere that she might come She of heaven spoke, though dumb. Waited all the Gods the event,â Love alone impatient: Unto Beauty then he led, Blushing as he whispered, One who kiss'd her. So her tongue Was freed, and the first poet's song. YET AGAIN Yet again! yet again! Dearest Love! you do but feign. That a kiss? Or that? or this? Must I ask you yet again? Yet again! yet again, Lover mine! as you were fain Me to kiss! What is amiss, You permit meâto complain? Yet again! yet again! Kisses should be swift as rain: Every kiss Repeats its bliss: Kiss me now, and then again! HYMENEAL O love! behold this Pair By Hymen brought together: Look on them young and fair, Give them fair weather! Make them to be As He and She Were but time-sunder'd, and now brought together Eternally must pair! Make each according heart So one with the other coupled That, each of the other part, 'Tis one heart doubled: So made to be That He and She Estrangement conquer'd, now in concord coupled, Must own one single heart. Love! hold thou fast this Pair; Hymen! keep them together; Whatever storms they share, Whate'er the weather: Yet leave them free: That He and She Love gladlyânot as slaves compell'd together, An ever-willing Pair. THE FAIR UNFAIR Too fair for me whose grief is thy unfairness, O Fair Unfair! and most unfair to me: Beguiler, whose rich beauty lack'd no rareness Except that rarest beauty, constancy! Why didst thou take my heart with loving words, To break, and fling away the worthless sherds? These rude sad sobs, poor fragments of lamenting, My heart-remains, I render back to thee, O fairest Falsehood! unto truth consenting, Then turning, true but to inconstancy. Take my last gift, my lost heart's worthless sherds, All that is due to One whose vows were words. WEED-LIKE Did you not say you loved me? And IâEnough, your word I could not doubt,âI heard. What change hath now removed me Out of the garden of your thought, As if I were a weed unsought? The flower of love you cherish'd In me (I had your word, That like some passing bird Dropp'd a fair seed), unperish'd, Must it be only weeded out By that worst foe of the garden, Doubt? O Love! who this forsaking SeÃ«st, I have no word Of prayer; but thou hast heard, And carest for this heart-aching. Thine is the hurt when in dark hours Men cast away thy very flowers. OF INCONSTANCY What wonder when the Sun's away We wander by the paler light? What wonder at the close of day We listen to the bird of night? And yet the Sun may be our choice, The lark's song most our souls rejoice. Of better Burgundy deprived, Bordeaux contents me for a while: Is it not so, though haply wived, One may accept a passing smile? Because I love Thee more than all, Must none thy loveliness recall? When Mars was absent, was it shame That Venus for young Adon pined? When Mars return'd, her constant flame Tow'rd him as steadily inclined. Dear! if the Mother of Love can change, Dost wonder Cupid's votaries range? WHY I LOVE Not for all thy beauty's splendour, Not for all the loving tender Of thy grace to me observant, Am I, Dear! thy grateful servant,â Nor for all thy gifts and graces,â But because my thought still places Thee with other things divine, Do I love thee, Lady mine! For thy truth and holiest chasteness, Where thy love as in a fastness Welcomes me, for thy devotion To haught honour, thine emotionâ Pitiful yet justly dealing Spite of womanliest feeling,â For thou art perfection's sign, Do I love thee, Lady mine! Were I all thy virtues telling, Heralds' catalogues outswelling, Other reasons well could measure Why in thee my love has pleasure: But I need not fill the story,â Whoso know thee see the glory Circling round thy face divine, Why I love thee, Lady mine! LEAP-YEAR Venus leans her cheek against His shoulder turn'd away: âLove me, Adon! though thou feignst: Thou wilt love me,âsay!â âLoveliest face!â she draws it down; And âPush me not away!â Adon answers with a frown; âThou wilt love me?â Nay! She has kiss'd his close cold lips, Her fond whisper may But repeat her kiss; she clips Him closer: yet 'tis Nay! Venus! vainly dost thou tempt: Love but yesterday Thee forsook. O Love-exempt! Wherefore dost thou pray? LOST LOVE As the rain-drops on the sand, As the snow-flakes on the sea, Is my love, with lavish hand Shower'd in vain on thee: To be lost Like the frost Of yet green mornings smiled on sunnily. As the the rain-drops on the sand, As the snow-flakes on the sea, Is my love: thy empty hand Wastes it, spurning me. Love's cold ghost, Like the frost Of wintry mornings, lingereth sullenly. ACROSS THE WORLD Across the world, my Dear! My hope shall reach to thee; Nor Joy, nor Doubt, nor Fear, Our severance be. Joy will some echo wake, Bringing thee ever near; And Doubt for thy dear sake Departs with Fear. And Grief herself shall look On me with those dear eyes, As absently she took Her one disguise. Across the world, my Dear! Though I may seem to roam, My heart is ever here With thee, at home. HEAVENLY EYES Tell me not of heavenly eyes, Suddenly glancing to surprize (As the sun in days which are Cloudy) eyes that watch and dare! Tell me not of bosom'd snow, With volcanic depths below Of a heart whose hidden fires Kindle uncontroul'd desires! Tell me not of wisest ways, And the subtlety bewrays How love's waited for, and yet Is not sure it will be met! Tell me rather of a soul Loving, but with such controul O'er itself that it may be Sure of its serenity! Tell me of a form so fair I scarce think of fairness there, Knowing how it doth enshrine All that love holds most divine! Tell me of sufficient wit Love need not be shamed of it! Fair or foul, as others deem, Thts is She I hold supreme. Be she homely, ay! as true, Thorough-loving, trusting through, Though she have not heavenly eyes, This is She as heaven I prize. WAITING Why should I wait, O Lover! Hearing thy call? I come. Wait? when thou dost discover Thy heartâmy home. Why should I wait, BelovÃ¨d! Ready to meet thy call? What though thou be unprovÃ¨d, Thine am I, all. Yet could I wait, dear Lover! Wanting thy voice (O heart!) Were it but one step over To where thou art. COUNT OF TIME How shall we count our hours? Nay, Love! our kisses count Our love's amount While the fount of time is ours. Count we our moments? Dear! Each moment is a kiss: Why, 'twere amiss To account for even a year. Who counts his kisses knows How much he did expend At his love's end. Our love shall have no close. HERO'S SONG âYet again, O my Leander!â Ere the happier Hours depart, Watching thee while thou dost wander Far from where thou leavest thy heart. Yet again, before the dullness Of the daylight hides thy form! Love! O Love! be ours the fullness Of delight before the storm. âNight! Day can not lend thee splendour, Night that brings Leander here: Hasten, Day! thy joys surrender For the presence of my Dear. Day of gloom! Night had such glory:ââ Ere she mourn'd her Castaway. Readers of Leander's story Love the night before the day. GRIEF Draw thy hand across thine eyes! Turn away! No tear fall for One who lies There to-day! Speak no word, nor seem to heed What they say! Can a dead heart care indeed? Thine to-day. One in grave and One grief-slain, Clay to clay! Parted ne'er to meet again: Pass away! MY MAIDEN Fair is she, as a morn most fair, And pure as earliest dew; Like Spring's first gold her crisped hair, Like heaven her eyes' deep blue; Her form is as the leopard's lithe, Her step as a wild fawn's free; And like her heart her song is blithe With loving thoughts of me. Glad thoughts, a halo round her face, Her heart is so astir: O love, my love, give me the grace Of thoughts as worthy Her! Sweet Heart! the very Gods were glad Its sweet outcome to see; And I a God since when She had Glad loving thoughts of me. WHICH OF US Surely we both loved passing well. How it happen'd I can not tell, But so it came: Was She fickle or was I tired? Whose the blame? Say that neither of us inquired Of that same. But this happen'd: one hazy day One of the twain was far astray; But how it came, Whether 'twas I or She who went, 'Tis no blame. Both may be wrong yet innocent All the same. WHICH Which art thou? boy or girl, with face So frank, devoid of shame, And closely curling hair, And with that rare Ingenuousness which would dishearten Blame, If Blame dared bring disgrace. Art thou Apollo?âhere again In simple shepherd guise, Simple, but gracious too, As when he knew To please Admetus, with those level eyes Of most divine disdain. Art Dian, only chastely hymn'd?â Or Nymph of Dian's Court, At home in the green wood? Methinks I could Attempt ActÃ¦onâhappy in such sort, My sight thereafter dimm'd. Which art thou?âI need ask no more: For my too venturing speech Hath scarcely touch'd thy cheek, And what I seek Is found in the swift blush, red as a peach, Mantling thy sweet face o'er. A HEALTH A health to the damosel tall! A health to my lass, though small! Black eyes, or blue, Or brown will do,â Or green: we will drink to all. A health to the maiden slim, If her eyes but with love are dim! Here's to the stout, Loving, no doubt! I'd pledge them both for a whim. Drink, drink to both dark and fair! To the girl with the golden hair; To her with the black; And never slack Till the red has a handsome share! A health toâThe sort don't mind. Since your wine is of various kind, Toast each, as they pass, In a separate glass! Remembering Love is blind. ADVICE TO A MAIDEN Wilt thou yield because he presses? Easily earn'd is quickly spent. Bind him, Maiden! with thy tresses! Hasten not event! Careless who too soon possesses: Lo, he came and went. Hold thy falcon in his jesses, For a while content! But she saidââThe giver blesses: Love is given, not lent.â And I thought her fond caresses Not improvident. DROUGHT The wind waves over the grass: Will it bring the rain? I know not. Sad heart! alas! Tears will not ease thy pain. We are wanting the rain for the seeds Lying hard in the earth; And our hopes have come up as weeds For the harvest of dearth. THE IDEAL Never for what She is Man loves, unknown her kind. And woman's love, like his, Is also blind. Each looks, but neither sees; Hidden from both the Real: And all Love's ecstasies Adore the Ideal. Wherefore, our wit so scant, Love we? Alas the hour! Ask why the full-grown plant Puts forth the flower! Track o'er the pathless seas The wild birds' way, And yet Love's mysteries Thou shalt not say. Seekers of what is not, The prize each one would win Is Beauty without spot And Truth within. Be glad if Hope can seize Some image of the Real, And calm sweet memories Still hold the Ideal! THE COUNTERFEIT If I could fashion Thee in stone, Fair as thyself, BelovÃ¨d One! Even Phidias were content to see The world's most beauteous effigy; And I with gazing on the stone Should wish myself Pygmalion. Could I upon the canvas paint Thy likeness, my love's worshipt Saint! To Raffaele's dreams a grace I'd lend, And with great Titian contend; All lesser painters should despair To express a face so more than fair. O might I borrow Sidney's quill, Or Jonson's rare poetic skill, And trace thy loveliness of mind In words of heart, till thine inclined To thank the poet at thy feet,â What song could be so honey-sweet? But in thy gloriousness of face, And in thy form's unstudied grace, I find such charms I must despair To fashion thy resemblance fair; And sculpture, painting, poesy, Are weak for counterfeiting Thee. LOVING FAITH Say the worst! Ere all is said Love hath fully answerÃ¨d. Defamation still may say And Detraction hold her way; All is said, and Love yet smiles: Loving faith no falsehood files. Yet, were slander true as troth, Censure likely as now loath, Or ifâPeace! the loving still Love, as Love for ever will. All is done: Love only smiles. Loving faith no doubt defiles. AIME MOI Aimez moi, je vous en prie! Never a word she understood: But her eyes told me she would, SaidâJe t' aime, mon bel ami! Aimez moi, je vous en prie! Not a word could she understand, But the pressure of her hand SaidâJe t' aime, mon bel ami! AimÃ¨ moi, and je t'en prie! Never a word her lips pass'd by: Sweeter kisses gave reply, SaidâJe t' aime, mon bel ami! FOR LOVE'S SAKE I would I were a fly on my Love's cheek, Or flea On her white bosom, or poor humble bee To sting her lip when I would honey seek: Since flies or fleas may come my Mistress nigh, All happier than I. O Love! transform me. No shape were amiss To take. Her four-legg'd favourite, centipede, or snake, I'd be if She my prettiness would kiss, And fondle me: so I might crawl beside This most dear Thing of Pride. Change me to anything that She can love! A toad: The jewel in my head I would unload; Some happier day She might the gift approve. Or make me (bully Jove! Love's memory jog,) A beautiful bull-frog! THRENODY Bring thy saddest tears, O Earth! Never canst thou have Such great Worth Thy grief to crave. Pour from all thy crystal springs Full sorrowings, Nor mind the after dearth! Strew on Her, O Trees! your leaves; Flowers, Blossoms! fade. Winter reaves And clouds must shade Your joys in Summer's jocund time, Since in her prime Death binds Her in his sheaves. Springs, and Groves, all things of Earth! Mourn since She is gone! Life's great mirth Is changed to moan; Hope, when She was laid in tomb, Dared not to bloom: So Loss defeated Worth. FORTUNA How many wouldst thou love? fair Maid! Sad was my heart, God wot: Thou makÃ¨st Love himself afraid, And yet who loves thee not? âI love, I love thee!â Such words said, Glad was my heart, God wot: Upon my heart thy fair head laid. And yet thou lovedst me not. She loved, she said; and left me so: Sad was my heart, God wot. Thy love of change so many know, And yet who loves thee not? Once leaving me thou didst look back (Glad was my heart, God wot,) As bidding me to keep thy track: And yet thou lovedst me not. O Love, whom Love hath made so fair! Sad is my heart, God wot: Thou leavest thy lovers to despair. And yet who loves thee not? SAPPHIC I love him, and he loves me not: alas That this should be! How should a maiden come to such a pass, A maiden free? Woe's me! Free once as wind: but were I as the wind, To him I'd flee, Breathe my love sighingly, and loving bind The now love-free. Woe's me! I love him and he loves me not. O Grief! My helper be; Wind! bear me unto him, as a dead leaf Is borne by thee. Woe's me! SLEEP Be still! She sleeps. Thy whitest smile, O Moon! (As once Endymion) In pallor steeps Her fair face while she sleeps. Be still! She sleeps. No leaf let fall, May-bloom! But sweet perfume, Where Silence creeps To watch her as she sleeps. Be hush'd! She sleeps. O tender-winged Moth! Have care, as loath To assail the keeps Where she still smiling sleeps. THE LAST TOAST Fling your hearts in the bowl till the liquor runs o'er! We have drunk many healths, there remaineth one more: We have named the BelovÃ¨d, the Fond and the Fair;â One toast yet invites us while time is to spare. Fling your hearts in the bowl, for the red wine runs low; And my toast must be had ere one man of us go. We have honour'd the Absent, and thought of the Dead In the silence of love when no tear may be shed. Fling your hearts in again! there's enough for a health: To the Fair whom we name not but worship by stealth? To the Fair long since loved? We remember'd them all.â To the âUnfair,â at leisure, or foul you befall! Full glasses to Her whom Love seems to forget, Whom Joy, narrow-minded, asks not to his set, To her the unworship'd, unwed, and unwoo'd, The Childless, the Martyr to life-solitude! Alone,âay, heart-lonely! Unlovely? Alas! Love himself the Most Lovely hath brought to this pass. Drink! drink! Who'll refuse, but to quit him of wrong; Or grudge her the Poet's poor solace of song? DETUR PULCHRIORI My Lady's eyes have heaven's hue, Serenely bright and blue. My Love's are black as deepest night By lightning's light. My Lady's face, like blushing rose, With swift emotion glows. And mine is pale, as marble fair, With feeling rare. Her hair is golden as the round On royal foreheads bound. Her's is more dark than ebon twine Of Proserpine. As gently-carriaged as the dove Of Venus, She I love. And She is goddess-like in mien As Jove's great Queen. So strove they; then unto a third The high dispute referr'd: He on his tablets this set downâ My girl is brown. LAIS For ever stumbling to a fall, And still afraid to look behind, Infirm of will, but wilful, all Thy native gifts have sown the wind. We found thy beauty but a lure, Thy ready tongue a treacherous bait. Thy love a fancyâto endure So long as fickleness could wait. High-placed as fair, with wit and sense, Love was thine own and honour lent: Hadst thou escaped incontinence, Thy happier life had known content. LINGERING Shall I for a woman pine When she cares not to be mine? Or, if she'll not have me her's, Come with the other servitors? Eager Love would droop and die, Waiting for so slow reply. I would be the first to woo, But would have her ready too: If she will not understand Asking pressure of the hand, Or the swift prayer of an eye, Dullness take her! what care I? Nay! and yet she must not haste: Hurried having is disgraced. But, as she sees me inclined, Let her only know her mind, To be prompt with her reply! Doubtful love is apt to die. PARIS JUSTIFIED What else had Paris but to choose The Queen of Beauty for his prize? What else when he had eyes to use, And sense to justify his eyes? Poor Wisdom, knowing not of love Or wish to propagate her kind, Such maidenhood, who may, approve! I own myself of Paris' mind. And Power that had no power to make A silly shepherd give to her The apple, even for love's sake,â Such Power, who will, to Love prefer! So, it meseemeth, Paris had Good cause for Wit to allow his choice, For Power to spare the happy lad Whom only Beauty could rejoice. HOMEWARD Swift-winged wind, wild bird of the waste ocean! Carry my message home: Tell her I come; Whisper unto her of my life's devotion. Stars that behold us both for all this distance Between me and my home: Tell her I come; Assure her of my faith and love's persistence. Fore-reaching Thought! thyself o'erstep the billow; Bear thine own message home. I come, I come. Even now, Dear Love! my glad heart is thy pillow. MISTRESS JANE Hard words, Mistress Jane! For a lover, âdespise and disdain.â But there's that in your eyes Bids me ask you again, Mistress Jane! I shall ask you âin vainâ; And may âleaveâ you. I wiser remain, For that look in your eyes Bids me stay, and so gain My own Jane. THE TRESPASS Out and alas For this my trespass! I kiss'd her when I should not: Not that she would not. By my troth 'twas a likely lass. Out and alas!â Herein my trespass: I would have love too quickly. She not unlikely: By my troth, so it came to pass. Out and alas!â For so brief trespass She turns from me her sunlight. Ne'ertheless I have done right. By my troth, 'twas a likely lass. EPICUREAN In Childhood's unsuspicious hours The fairies crown'd my head with flowers. Youth came: I lay at Beauty's feet; She smiled and said my song was sweet. Then Age and, Love no longer mine, My brows I shaded with the Vine. With flowers and love and wine and song; O Death! life hath not been too long. THE SINGER'S APOLOGY Mere waste of wit these poor love-rimes, These tinklings fit to tickle ears Of silly boys and girls in times Of play: offence to serious years! Yet so did Shakspere spend his hours, And Sidney judged love-lore no shame, And Jonson grudged not noblest powers: If not their praise, I share their blame. Nor do I of mere idlesse sing: Albeit without didactic bent, My simple notes perchance may bring Some lesson of a wise content. Rebuke the lark âat heaven's gateâ! Reprove the foolish nightingale! While these may sing I will not wait, Though wisdom frown or critics rail.</field>
