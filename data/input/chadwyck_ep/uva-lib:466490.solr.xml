      <field name="fulltext">TO HER MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY Alexandrina Victoria, AS TO THE FOUNTAIN OF ALL MORAL INSTRUCTION, THIS LITTLE VOLUME IS MOST RESPECTFULLY AND HUMBLY INSCRIBED</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MORAL AXIOMS. PART I. This First Part is a selection from the Proverbs of Solomon. The first nineteen couplets must be considered introductory, and are taken in regular succession from the First Chapter of the Proverbs. 1 Of Solomon the wise, the voice attend; Thine ear to holy David's offspring bend. Prov. ch. i. v. l. 2 Instruction from his lips profound receive; And what he says, as oracles believe. Ib. v. 2. 3 Hence dulness may be chang'd to sharp and sage; And youth may learn the wariness of age. Prov. ch. i. v. 4. 4 The hidden sense of Proverbs youth shall gain; Nor the dark oracle be spoke in vain. Ib. v. 5. 5 Fear of the Lord, these Proverbs first will teach;â Who know not God, can wisdom never reach. Ib. v. 6. 6 Child! hear the counsels of thy father's voice, And in thy mother's soft commands rejoice. Ib. v. 8. 7 For their advice thine head with flowers shall deck; And more adorn than chains about thy neck. Ib. v. 9. 8 Attend not sinners, when they would entice; Nor list a moment to the lures of vice. Prov. ch. i. v. 10. 9 The robber cries: âLet us for blood lie wait; âThe innocent prepares not for his fate. Ib. v. 11. 10 âThe grave shall hide the secret from our foes; âAnd in the pit the crime with them repose. Ib. v. 12. 11 âThen wealth will come to recompense the toil; âAnd we shall fill our houses with the spoil. Ib. v. 13. 12 âCome, join the crew; come, cast away thy care; âAnd thou shalt in the common treasure share.â Ib. v. 14. 13 My child! these sons of darkness ever fly; And from their wickedness avert thine eye. Prov. ch. i. v. 15. 14 Their feet from evil unto evil run; Each day that ends, some new foul deed is done. Ib. v. 16. 15 Thus warn'd, avoid the danger for thee set; Nor seek, like silly birds, the fowler's net. Ib. v. 17. 16 By snares, they lay for others, they shall fall; And their own blood shall dash against the wall. Ib. v. 18. 17 Then hearken, child! to wisdom's voice, whose cries, Through all the streets, and from the house-tops, rise. Ib. v. 19. 18 How long, O fool! thy folly wilt thou prize? Joy in the sinner, and the bad man's lies? Prov. ch. i. v. 20. 19 But if thou hear'st my counsel, thou shalt go Safe in thy ways, and no misfortunes know. Ib. v. 33. 20 From God alone can understanding flow; And only they who hear him wisdom know. Ib. ch. ii. v. 6. 21 Up for the good he stores of joy will lay; And is a shield to those who will obey. Ib. ch. ii. v. 7. 22 In thine own self-conceit thy faith control; Obey Heaven's laws; and thou shalt save thy soul. Ib. ch. iii. v. 7. 23 To thy bones marrow, soundness to thy heart, The wisdom of the Almighty shall impart. Prov. ch. iii. v. 8. 24 Thus in sound health thy body thou shalt keep; And in unfever'd peace thy mind shall sleep. Ib. ch. iii. v. 8. 25 Thou shalt bestow thy substance to his praise, And shrines of incense as thine offerings raise. Ib. ch. iii. v. 9. 26 Wisdom more precious is than rubies rare; No other treasure can with her compare. Ib. ch. iii. v. 15. 27 The earth God founded, and the vaulted sky;â Seas roll, and thunders roar, and lightnings fly. Ib. ch. iii. v. 19. 28 By God's command the depths their fountains ope; And the big clouds the dew and manna drop. Prov. ch. iii. v. 20. 29 He props, when on his road the righteous faints, And guides through thorny paths his faithful saints. Ib. ch. iii. v. 23. 30 Safe shall they tread their path, who fear their God; Nor shall their footsteps stumble on the road. Ib. ch. iii. v. 23. 31 In dreams no fearful visions shall they meet; But peaceful shall their slumbers be, and sweet. Ib. ch. iii. v. 24. 32 Goodness may fear no sudden danger's cries; Nor when the shrieks of wickedness arise. Ib. ch. iii. v. 25. 33 Ten-fold accurst is he who can devise Wrong to the man who on his faith relies. Prov. ch. iii. v. 29. 34 Harm not who puts his credence in thy will; The wrong to him who trusts is ten-fold ill. Ib. ch. iii. v. 29. 35 With him, who not offends, no quarrel raise; Nor throw a stumbling-block in Peace's ways. Ib. ch. iii. v. 30. 36 Th' oppressor's fame with envy do not view; Nor be seduc'd his glory to pursue. Ib. ch. iii. v. 31. 37 The wicked triumph soon shall sink to dust; The righteous see it; nor will lose their trust. Ib. ch. iii. v. 32. 38 Curses upon the wicked, Heaven will throw; But blessings shall the righteous dwelling know. Prov. ch. iii. v. 33. 39 Glory upon the wise shall come at last; But shame on impious folly God will cast. Ib. ch. iii. v. 35. 40 If wisdom rule thy heart, and knowledge joy, No future evil shall thy peace destroy. Ib. ch. iii. v. 35. 41 The wicked are not, save in mischief, strong; Nor sleep, save when they do to others wrong. Ib. ch. iv. v. 16. 42 From robbery and pillage is their food; They drink not but of violence and blood. Ib. ch. iv. v. 17. 43 But virtue's passage is a shining light; As in his course the sun becomes more bright. Prov. ch. iv. v. 18. 44 The wicked, all in darkness, stumbles on; And to direct his footsteps knows no dawn. Ib. ch. iv. v. 19. 45 Nor to the right hand, nor the left hand, sway, But onward let thy footsteps work their way. Ib. ch. iv. v. 27. 46 The lips of vicious women soft may seem, But, like a two-edged sword, with death they teem. Ib. ch. v. v. 4, 5. 47 Be faithful, and the partner of thy days Shall, like the loving hind, attend thy ways. Ib. ch. v. v. 19. 48 Go, sluggard! to the ant; her lesson prize, And in thy copied industry be wise. Prov. ch. vi. v. 6. 49 She, without guide, her food in summer reaps; Nor, till the harvest toil is ended, sleeps. Ib. ch. vi. v. 7, 8. 50 Let not, thou sluggard! thy repose be deep; Arouse thy body from thy lazy sleep! Ib. ch. vi. v. 9. 51 The fire thou canst not handle, yet not burn; Thou canst not hold unharm'd the flaming urn. Ib. ch. vi. v. 27. 52 Who veils his mischief, strikes with arrow sure; But open malice bears abroad its cure. Ib. ch. x. v. 10. 53 The wicked, like the whirlwind, pass away: The righteous have an everlasting day. Prov. ch. x. v. 25. 54 The wicked's force is like the whirlwind's might; The good man's power no time will put to flight. Ib. ch. x. v. 25. 55 E'en as a tree of life, is virtue's fruit; And wisdom branches ten-fold from the root. Ib. ch. xi. v. 30. 56 Stripes on the good themselves on earth are laid; Then shall the wicked punishment evade? Ib. ch. xi. v. 31. 57 Better is humble competence, though scorn'd, Than inward want, with outward pomp adorn'd. Ib. ch. xii. v. 9. 58 For self the wicked plots, but yet he fails; The good man toils for others, yet prevails. Prov. ch. xii. v. 12. 59 By his own lips' deceit the bad is snar'd; The good man speaks his heart, and he is spar'd. Ib. ch. xii. v. 13. 60 The fool gives credence to his own vain thought; Who lists to counsel is with wisdom fraught. Ib. ch. xii. v. 15. 61 With the same glory truth shall ever rise; Falsehood may for a moment please, then dies. Ib. ch. xii. v. 17. 62 The tongue of hatred pierces like a sword; But there is health in a benignant word. Ib. ch. xii. v. 18. 63 The good and just no evil shall befal; The bad man breaks his head against a wall. Prov. ch. xii. v. 21. 64 The wise man scorns his knowledge to display; Fools by their talk, their ignorance betray. Ib. ch. xii. v. 23. 65 Who has no faith in self, yields up his power; Praise, like fresh dew, revives the drooping flower. Ib. ch. xii. v. 25. 66 Care and solicitude man's courage bend; But glad words ope to him a happy end. Ib. ch. xii. v. 25. 67 The slothful knows not his own prize to use; But diligence will not its gains abuse. Ib. ch. xii. v. 27. 68 A virtuous son a father's voice attends; But he who spurns it, in perdition ends. Prov. ch. xiii. v. l. 69 The vain, possess'd of nought, their riches vaunt; And cunning wealth puts on the garb of want. Ib. ch. xiii. v. 7. 70 Better is competence, that makes no shew, Than blaze abroad, and want at home to know. Ib. ch. xiii. v. 7. 71 Wealth by vain arts obtain'd, shall melt away, But got by honest toil and worth, shall stay. Ib. ch. xiii. v. 11. 72 From hope that is deferr'd, the spirits pine; But when she comes, the pleasure is divine. Ib. ch. xiii. v. 12. 73 Shame waits the man, who knowledge dares despise; But fame crowns him, who from reproof grows wise. Prov. ch. xiii. v. 18. 74 The virtuous aim fulfill'd delights the heart; But sinners will not from their course depart. Ib. ch. xiii. v. 19. 75 Who of another's heart the pangs can know? Or of his conscience the internal glow? Ib. ch. xiv. v. 10. 76 Mid laughter oft the heart is full of grief; Sadness comes soon, and lasts;âbut joy is brief. Ib. ch. xiv. v. 13. 77 No peace is by a yielding conscience gain'd: Mind is at ease, when virtue is sustain'd. Ib. ch. xiv. v. 14. 78 Who boast the labours they will execute, End all in vapour, which brings forth no fruit. Prov. ch. xiv. v. 14. 79 There is no hope, the fool his mind will mend; Each day new lights the prudent head attend. Ib. ch. xiv. v. 15. 80 The fool believes each flippant gossip's breath; But wisdom ponders ere it gives its faith. Ib. ch. xiv. v. 15. 81 The wise man stays ere he pursues his will; The fool is rash, and confident in ill. Ib. ch. xiv. v. 16. 82 Harmless, whose ire in hasty words will dart; Hateful, who broods on malice in his heart. Ib. ch. xiv. v. 17. 83 The wise man o'er the mighty shall prevail; And skill the walls of proudest strength can scale. Prov. ch. xiv. v. 19. 84 Friendship can never poverty withstand; The rich have always friends at their command. Ib. ch. xiv. v. 20. 85 Friendship, when poverty assails, will flee: The world crowds round the rich, and bends the knee. Ib. ch. xiv. v. 20. 86 He profits, who his time in labour spends; Who boasts but does not work, in vapour ends. Ib. ch. xiv. v. 23. 87 Wealth to the wise is virtue, joy, and power, But folly 'twill in vice and wrong devour. Ib. ch. xiv. v. 24. 88 He, who is slow to wrath, is good and wise; But hasty anger into folly flies. Prov. ch. xiv. v. 29. 89 Life on a calm and kindly spirit blooms: Envy, like rotten bones, the mind consumes. Ib. ch. xiv. v. 30. 90 The wicked, when misfortune comes, despairs; The good man hopes mid pains, and woes, and cares. Ib. ch. xiv. v. 32. 91 Of anger's voice soft words will still the fire; But bitter words will fix the passing ire. Ib. ch. xv. v. 1. 92 Wisdom awaits the moment when to speak; Fools, without thought or prudence, silence break. Ib. ch. xv. v. 2. 93 Folly, to him who is not wise, is joy; But thoughts of truth the upright man employ. Prov. ch. xv. v. 14. 94 When Love presides, with herbs the table drest Is sweeter than rich fare when Hate is guest. Ib. ch. xv. v. 17. 95 From his tongue's wisdom man derives delight: A word in season spoke is full of might. Ib. ch. xv. v. 23. 96 Rapine shall end in trouble and in shame; But honesty shall live in peace and name. Ib. ch. xv. v. 27. 97 Heaven puts her mark upon the taunting proud; And vengeance takes, when bucklers round them crowd. Ib. ch. xvi. v. 5. 98 Man in his mind contrives his means and ends; But God alone th' unpurpos'd issue sends. Prov. ch. xvi. v. 9. 99 Better than gold is wisdom's fruit to gain; Or all that fools can give, or toil attain. Ib. ch. xvi. v. 16. 100 Whose heart is right, shall gather wisdom's name, And eloquence shall still exalt his fame. Ib. ch. xvi. v. 21. 101 It is the heart which teacheth soundest sense, And to the lips gives flowery eloquence.

Ib. ch. xvi. v. 27. 107 The froward joys the storms of strife to strew; And sow the seeds of hate where friendship grew. Ib. ch. xvi. v. 28. 108 Strife, the perverse of spirit joy to sow;â The wicked whisperer makes the friend a foe.

Ib. ch. xvii. v. 5. 118 Children, that to their grandsires' virtue cling, On the past race reflected virtue bring.

Ib. ch. xvii. v. 16. 126 Friendship the change of seasons can abide; A brother's love is by misfortune tried. Ib. ch. xvii. v. 17. 127 Friendship is steady in the hour of woe; A brother must a brother's kindness show.

Prov. ch. xvii. v. 21. 129 The wicked man no truth in right discerns; But to his bribe the voice of justice turns. Ib. ch. xvii. v. 23. 130 Between the good and bad distinction make; Nor of impartial justice vengeance take. Ib. ch. xvii. v. 26. 131 The fool, who holds his peace, is counted wise; And wisdom to close lips the thought supplies. Ib. ch. xvii. v. 28. 132 A monarch's ire is like the lion's roar; His smiles, like dews that drooping plants restore. Ib. ch. xviii. 133 Scorn in his babbling train the wicked draws; With scorn, reproach, and recklessness of laws. Prov. ch. xviii. v. 3. 134 The rich mind, as the ocean's bed, is deep; Wisdom, like flowing streams, its course can keep. Ib. ch. xviii. v. 4. 135 Wisdom is like deep waters in a well; And her rich springs, like flowing rivers swell. Ib. ch. xviii. v. 4. 136 The words of fools destruction with them bear; And when they should defend them, are their snare.

Ib. ch. xviii. v. 13. 138 High souls are buoyant when by tempests tost; But when the mind gives way, the man is lost. Prov. ch. xviii. v. 14. 139 Courage of mind the body's pains will calm; But for a wounded spirit is no balm. Ib. ch. xviii. v. 14. 140 The wise will knowledge as a duty court;â And prudence, her self-interest to support. Ib. ch. xviii. v. 15. 141 Strong towns are weaker than a brother's hate; And guarded less, the castle's iron gate. Ib. ch. xviii. v. 19. 142 A brother's anger less can be appeas'd, Than a strong castle's barriers can be seiz'd. Ib. ch. xviii. v. 19. 143 Who knows not when to speak, and when be mute, Of his rash babbling tongue must eat the fruit.

Ib. ch. xix. v. 4. 145 He that hath power, will ever suitors find, And flattery showers upon the bounteous mind. Ib. ch. xix. v. 4. 146 Patient and slow to anger, is the wise; And rather than resent, he will despise. Ib. ch. xix. v. 11. 147 Sloth will, in lifeless sleep, existence close; And want will tread upon the vain repose.

Prov. ch. xix. v. 27. 149 On the heart's secrets mantling waters close; But skill shall draw them from their deep repose. Ib. ch. xx. v. 5. 150 For, their own worth men claim the honour due; But who, in trial's hour, shall find it true? Ib. ch. xx. v. 6. 151 But who is just, and in his worth sincere, His children's children shall the blessing wear. Ib. ch. xx. v. 7. 152 Who dares to boast, âMy heart is clean within; I have my bosom purified from sin?â Ib. ch. xx. v. 9. 153 In very childhood vice or worth has sway; The sports, the words, the character betray. Prov. ch. xx. v. 11. 154 But on thou sleepest, to the future blind; And art, when labour calls, to rest resign'd. Ib. ch. xx. v. 13. 155 The buyer, when he cheapens, cries, â'Tis naught;â But boasts his bargain, when the thing is bought. Ib. ch. xx. v. 14. 156 Man boasts the golden ore, the jewel rare; But knowledge is the gem the palm to wear. Ib. ch. xx. v. 15. 157 A moment sweet, the bread by rapine won, Turns in the end to gravel and to stone. Ib. ch. xx. v. 17. 158 The sudden heritage, by rapine got, A little while shall shine, then waste and rot. Prov. ch. xx. v. 21. 159 Strength to the young and wisdom to the old; Beauty of age in hoary hairs behold. Ib. ch. xx. v. 29. 160 Man his own deeds gilds by self-flattering arts; But God the secrets knows of human hearts. Ib. ch. xxi. v. 2. 161 Proud hearts, high looks, that mean subjection win, And all ambition's plottings, are but sin. Ib. ch. xxi. v. 4. 162 He who away from wisdom's paths shall dwell, Shall be death's servant, and descend to hell. Ib. ch. xxi. v. 16. 163 Lovers of pleasure shall to pain descend; And he who feasts, in beggary shall end. Prov. ch. xxi. v. 17. 164 Horses and chariots for the fight are sought; But by God's mercy is the battle fought.

Ib. ch. xxii. v. 3. 166 Wealth has the power its mean desires can crave; The borrower to the lender is a slave. Ib. ch. xxii. v. 7. 167 Cast out the scornful tongue, and strife shall cease; Use gentle words, and thou shalt be at peace. Ib. ch. xxii. v. 10. 168 The slothful cries, âBehold, a lion come!â Seeking excuse to doze the hours at home. Prov. ch. xxii. v. 13. 169 'Tis not the fare of sordid avarice; But think to snare thee, 'tis a base device. Ib. ch. xxiii. v. 6. 170 He asks thee to be sharer in his cheer; But when he asks thee, he is not sincere. Ib. ch. xxiii. v. 7. 171 Thou shalt repent the feast before thee set; And sicken at the dainties thou hast eat. Ib. ch. xxiii. v. 8. 172 To want, the drunkard and the glutton come, And beggary shall be the sluggard's doom. Ib. ch. xxiii. v. 21. 173 Let the just fall seven times, and he will rise; If once the wicked has a fallâhe dies. Prov. ch. xxiv. 174 Envy not wicked men, who prosperous seem; Nor when they roll in riches, happy deem. Ib. ch. xxiv. v. 1. 175 He who of ill shall sow, shall reap of ill; Nor change to good the vicious at his will. Ib. ch. xxiv. v. 8. 176 Not with the banner of the rebel range; Mix not with those whose heads are given to change. Ib. ch. xxiv. v. 21. 177 Who with the praise of goodness lauds the worst, And vice and virtue mingles, shall be curst. Ib. ch. xxiv. v. 24. 178 Without due proof, no tale injurious name; Nor urge on others, while thou smil'st, to blame. Prov. ch. xxiv. v. 28. 179 Nettles the vineyard of the slothful crown; And the stone wall of fence is broken down. Ib. ch. xxiv. v. 31. 180 Look, and the picture as a lesson view; And thou henceforth shalt idleness eschew. Ib. ch. xxiv. v. 32. 181 A little longer to thy slumbers keep; A little folding of thine arms to sleep: Ib. ch. xxiv. v. 33. 182 Then poverty shalt come with her alarms; And want shall seize thee as a man of arms. Ib. ch. xxiv. v. 34. 183 God, in his wisdom, his desires conceals; A king the reasons of his acts reveals. Prov. ch. xxv. v. 2. 184 Honey is sweet, but when abundant, cloys; They lose their pleasures, all immoderate joys. Ib. ch. xxv. v. 16. 185 In storms the wicked shall from earth be borne; As by the roots a mighty tree is torn. Ib. ch. xxv. v. 22. 186 As by north winds the rain is driven away; So will rebuke the slanderer's poison stay. Ib. ch. xxv. v. 23. 187 When good men sink before their wicked foes, 'Tis as when fountains to the thirsty close. Ib. ch. xxv. v. 26. 188 To his own passions who a victim falls, Is like an open city without walls. Prov. ch. xxv. v. 28. 189 Whip for the horse, and bridle for the ass; And only by the rod will folly pass. Ib. ch. xxvi. v. 3. 190 Let not a fool be puff'd with his conceit; That his own folly he should know, is meet. Ib. ch. xxvi. v. 5. 191 Thorns on his hand the drunkard senseless breaks; And thus the fool, unweeting, proverbs speaks. Ib. ch. xxvi. v. 9. 192 Who in the day of sorrow shall despair, Has not a soul; for man is born to bear. Ib. ch. xxvi. v. 10. 193 As the foul dog the cast-up vomit eats, The sins, that vex'd him, so the fool repeats. Prov. ch. xxvi. v. 11. 194 The wicked hear a foe in every wind: Bold as a lion is the good man's mind. Ib. ch. xxviii. v. 1. 195 I would not want; nor yet in riches shine; Content if humble competence be mine. Ib. ch. xxviii. v. 6. 196 Who gains by usury, shall pass the store To better ones, who will regard the poor. Ib. ch. xxviii. v. 8. 197 Virtue's advance to power is glory's reign; Worth, when the wicked rule, will toil in vain. Ib. ch. xxviii. v. 12. 198 To prosperous end no hypocrite shall go; Who owns and flies his faults, shall mercy know. Prov. ch. xxviii. v. 13. 199 Safe are the hearts, which evil ways appal; The harden'd soul to hopeless guilt shall fall. Ib. ch. xxviii. v. 14. 200 Murder, that sends another to the grave, Let no man stretch a hand, from death to save. Ib. ch. xxviii. v. 17. 201 The cultur'd land will plenteous food supply; Who tills it not, in poverty shall die. Ib. ch. xxviii. v. 19. 202 Wholesome reproof the bosom's kindness gains: False flattery draws resentment for her pains. Ib. ch. xxviii. v. 23. 203 He shall not want, who shall relieve the poor; But curs'd who turns the beggar from his door. Prov. ch. xxviii. v. 27. PART II. ORIGINAL AXIOMS. 1 Who search for novelty with ears or eyes, Less eager are for truth than weak surmise. 2 All pleasure but a contrast is with pain; And ease from toil alone its zest can gain. 3 We love not what we have; but when it flies, Then the lost treasure we begin to prize. 4 In a few words is wisdom often found: When language multiplies, 'tis empty sound. 5 'Tis intellect, that marks the creature, man: 'Tis vain to look on what we cannot scan. 6 Age is more happy, since it less will hope. 'Tis misery to look beyond our scope. 7 Fame were a bubble, only that it leads Th' aspirant to high hopes and mighty deeds. 8 'Tis from th' employ,âand not the fruit that flows,â The pleasure the neglected poet knows. 9 Why dwell we on the ills we cannot cure? Forgetfulness will fit us to endure. 10 Old age is calm, because few hopes we nurse: Defeated expectation is a curse. 11 Experience teaches that the gains of life Are won by cunning, or beset with strife. 12 We praise, perchance, but love not who excel: They who beneath us are, our triumph swell. 13 Our weary life why seek we to prolong, When morning wakes us but to fight with wrong? 14 Craft, in this worldly path of snares and pits, Is the sole guide the traveller befits. 15 With added days, the added labour done, Consoles us for the thread of life that's gone. 16 He, in whom what he sees awakes not thought, Might equally of wood or stone be wrought. 17 Black melancholy life's clear current stains, And breeds all humours in the loaded veins. 18 To pass our days in idleness is crime: We shall be called to reckonings for our time. 19 Our thoughts to govern, we must art employ; Or they will rule us first, and then destroy. 20 Age does not fear, like youth, approaching death; The weary are content to lose their breath. 21 Envy pursues the virtuous and the great: There is no peace in an exalted state. 22 The love of praise, once fed, with fury raves; The more 'tis feasted, still the more it craves. 23 'Twere well in safe content obscure to live; Nor seek for joys our being cannot give. 24 Peace, innocence, a frugal board, and fire, And cottage thatch'd, may satisfy desire. 25 To seek th' applause of other minds to gain, And rule their wild caprice, is endless pain. 26 As length of years will o'er the mind prevail, Why first do Memory's impressions fail? 27 Knowledge is varied power, that should be nurst: Of all, the moral lesson is the first. 28 How little he, who knows each other art, But is unskilful of the human heart. 29 From brightest outward things no pleasure miss; The mind and feeling only make our bliss. 30 Who tears all comfort from the sick man's bed, The torments of eternal woe may dread! 31 It is a virtue to improve the mind; And if for truth we labour, we shall find. 32 If first 'tis dark, and our first efforts fail, Firm perseverance will at length prevail. 33 But lightly at the first impediment Our courage leaves us, and our toil is spent. 34 We must not, with unsteady footsteps, leap From course to course, but one same pathway keep. 35 The mind cannot control the frame diseas'd; But with the body's pangs the mind is seiz'd. 36 Whence comes opinion?âFrom the varied source Of reason, feeling, fancy, inward force. 37 To some a light intuitive is given, Which seems to come from secret truths of heaven. 38 For ever busy, the eccentric brain Brings out its visions in an endless train. 39 Each day some new distinction we trace out; And solve some deep perplexity from doubt. 40 The chaos of our minds, from year to year, From outer darkness we to order clear. 41 By exercise our skill and courage grows, And that, which once was scanty, overflows. 42 The stagnant intellect, each hour more dull, Grows weak alone, and is of poison full. 43 The fearful and fastidious have no worth; They strangle their own offspring in the birth. 44 From fearless freedom comes the flowing lay, That shines transparent in unclouded day. 45 The niggard fount, that drop by drop exudes, Will never run to navigable floods. 46 There is a native brilliance, which nice art, And toil, and polish, never can impart. 47 The retrospect of all our joys and loves Is pain, save those that innocence approves. 48 Who thinks on self alone, and private cares, A brain and heart of basest darkness bears. 49 Craft is a weapon by which more is done Than all that genius and that worth has won. 50 Sorrow is oft the good man's heritage; And worldlings war with virtue ever wage. 51 Wealth, which the sire long years of crime has cost, By the son's follies oft in days is lost. 52 Life, from the loop-hole of retreat, survey; And own its joys are but a false display. 53 The ready pen, that, as they rise, can tell The thoughts that cross us, has a mighty spell. 54 The moral bard, whose verse the path displays That we should go, most merits all our praise. 55 Blest is the rhyme, that on the minds of youth, With easy force, can fix some moral truth. 56 He fails, who pleasure makes his prime pursuit; For pleasure is of duty done the fruit. 57 All wish, when sinking to the darksome grave, Some slight record their humble names to save. 58 With joy, if we have toil'd for other's good, In our last moments on the thought we brood. 59 But selfish labours, at the hour of death, Both spurn and nauseate with a trembling breath. 60 Truth has a loveliness that never tires; We clasp her ever with augmenting fires. 61 Conceit is emptiness, to folly bent; But a just self-complacence breeds content. 62 To be the sport of every blast that blows, Is wild emotion, that no surety knows. 63 High truth and wisdom in themselves are bright, And in their utmost nakedness delight. 64 Above earth's grovelling vapour to aspire, Thou must be purified by mental fire. 65 Rich moral wisdomâTruth's deep-cradled heir, Must be sought out with toil, and skill, and care. 66 The world are with each other all contending, And with all fame Detraction's voice is blending. 67 Let cheerfulness upon thy bosom shine! Sour grows the blood of those who vainly pine. 68 Of life who seeks to know the primal art, Must learn how best to regulate the heart 69 Mind may be right, yet, if the heart be wrong, 'Tis but the tinkle of a passing song. 70 Reason will rule not o'er a wicked breast; The plaudit of the conscience is the test. 71 Conscience within the bosom's inmost cells Sits, and the false and fraudulent repels. 72 Who other's comforts views with jaundiced eye Will sicken, 'till of spleen and bile he die. 73 Let none in passion's mists himself involve; For evil passion yields to bold resolve. 74 The noble thought, the scorn of low desires, Will light within the bosom holy fires. 75 The idle drag along the heavy hours; And Vice sits brooding o'er neglected powers. 76 Pining and sickness, misery at their doom, The sluggish and the unemploy'd consume. 77 With what delight the steady workman stands To see the web, that grows beneath his hands! 78 Hope without object, feast by toil unwon, Sleep without rest,âby these is man undone. 79 To him, would vainly open Paradise, Who has his humours all, yet finds no blissâ 80 Who would, in rank, above his fellows rise, Should strive of intellect to win the prizeâ 81 There is not aught but Virtue shines above, The Muses' palm, in glory, or in love. 82 The glare of wealth, crowns that the temples bind, Vanish before the lustre of the mind. 83 Before the good man's meek and humble ray, E'en shall the lamp of Genius fade away. 84 The skies, the air, the morning's breezy call, Alike are free, and full of health to all. 85 The poor man's veins are glowing with a tide As fresh and genial as the sons of pride. 86 'Tis in the brain's recess, the inward shrine Of the heart's temple, glows the spark divine. 87 The glittering dress of jewels and of gold, May cover o'er a spirit dull and cold. 88 A moment's joy is in the fraudful veil; A moment passes, and its light grows pale. 89 Let the proud weak man high his banner lift: It falls before the grand by Nature's gift. 90 Poor puny insect, shivering at the blast, Thou, low in worth, tho' high in rank, art cast! 91 Stern in resolve, by sterling worth to gain Love and respect, thou shalt not will in vain. 92 The impotent, in ermine clad, shall bow To native strength, which breaks not virtue's vow. 93 Why dost thou bend, or less esteem thyself, Before the gaudy glare of boasting pelf? 94 Riches will not the light of brain bestow, Or to the dull impart the spirits' glow! 95 Who live by others' aid, and cannot feed Upon themselves, will know the day of need. 96 Strength to the arm, and vigour to the head, By strenuous and progressive toil is bred. 97 Seek truth, and on its nakedness rely, And from delusion's transient pleasures fly. 98 Insulted by the tales that flatter pride, The strong by nature murmur,âthen deride. 99 Mock not the lot of him with proud disdain, Who earns his daily bread by toil and pain. 100 Not more content than him opprest by want, Thy seeming bliss embitters as a taunt. 101 What is this love of fame, but want of sense:â A battle that enslaves us to pretence. 102 Mankind's opinion is too oft caprice; And he who counts it, never is at peace. 103 Lord of thyself, do thou as conscience rules, Then scorn the praise or blame of knaves and fools. 104 With steady step complacent go thy way; As Nature prompts, to tender, grave or gay. 105 Shouts of the mob, or plaudits of the wise, Will soothe not pain, nor calm affection's sighs. 106 If in thyself the power or gift is wrought, It need not fear another will or thought. 107 Try not what thy condition does not suit; From uncongenial soils there is no fruit. 108 With toil to culture, yet no harvest find; To make th' attempt, yet fail, unsprings the mind. 109 Each in his calling may some store produce, And to his fellow-beings be of use. 110 Prepare thyself for storms; thy bosom brace; The morbid ne'er can keep a steady pace. 111 The sensitive, in this tempestuous clime, Will yield the day, and perish ere their prime. 112 Calm, cheerful, seeking sunshine, shunning gloom, The wise and good go gently to the tomb. 113 Throw off regrets; we can undo no more The past; nor can by tears the dead restore. 114 Veiling the past, before thy beamy view; The smiling form of buoyant hope pursue. 115 Hope may still vanish as we nearer draw; Again we see her, as before we saw! 116 Does the wretch, naked, houseless, with the cry Of hunger shrieking, kiss the ground and die? 117 With poverty, with famine, thirst, and strife, With cold benumb'd, he oft preserves his life. 118 The rich with feasts and pleasures draws his breath, Yet oft he faints, sighs, groans, and sinks to death. 119 Thus is all mortal being born to woe, And equal fate befals the high and low. 120 With surfeit sick of every earthly boon; The humour'd infant sorrows for the moon. 121 Fed and swoln up with every gift of wealth, The pamper'd child wants life's first blessing, health. 122 While round the ploughman's frame blow fresh'ning gales, Health from the upturn'd furrow he inhales. 123 Learning with gloom too oft the bosom fills; Knowledge, the foresight opens of our ills. 124 It is a solace to the poor man's breast, That in the grave all ranks shall equal rest. 125 By hues as false and dangerous as bright, The world's vain hopes bewilder and excite. 126 Clear the delusive halo from thine eyes, And firmly into truth and wisdom rise. 127 Who think not right, nor reason have for guide, By Will-o'-wisps will e'er be led aside. 128 Passion indulg'd will vapoury shadows raise, That with a pestilential lustre blaze. 129 Sunshine around the virtuous man is cast; Hope in the front, complacence in the past. 130 Wisdom would richer grow to age from youth, Were observation the sole source of truth. 131 A light inborn, sagacious, clear and strong, From our first manhood shews us right from wrong. 132 Genius, and not experience, go before, And in our early years supply the store. 133 Who has not skill with niceness to discern, By a long life's observance will not learn. 134 Confus'd by all he sees, as objects press, The knowledge of the fool each day grows less. 135 As years in folly's memory run their race, New prints, as waves on sand, the past efface. 136 The babble of the weak, whom years should teach, Grows lighter, as maturer years they reach. 137 As witches the mysterious fusions blend, The cauldron bubbles, and the flames ascend. 138 A smoky vapour first the fire enshrouds, Then bursts the brilliance from the flying clouds. 139 Ere yet the train, far upward to the skies, Can throw its golden light, thick mists arise. 140 Pursue the stirring of the ingredients rich, And thou at last thy readers wilt bewitch. 141 From small beginnings comes the speck of flame, With which the Muse will gradual light thy frame. 142 Glimmering and doubtful, with a scanty ray, First thro' the fuel it works out its way. 143 Despond not; boldness, perseverance, hope, May with cold chills and smothering ashes cope. 144 Look round on life, and seek with searching eye, Wherein the comforts of our being lie! 145 Pursue the path which understanding traces; Who blindly goes, to certain ruin paces. 146 To keep off want be thy endeavours bent; But be with humble competence content. 147 Sloth is the rust of body and of mind; Not as a slave to toil thy body bind. 148 The mind some interposing rest requires; The brain will perish, if too fierce its fires. 149 To thine own woes be not thy thoughts confin'd; But go a-field, and think of all mankind. 150 In meditation wide, from self remote, Upon the wings of stingless air we float. 151 There is no pain in truth-researching thought, From depths of intellectual fountains wrought. 152 The toil is feverish, when on selfish good, Mov'd by mean passions, anxiously we brood. 153 False lights and shadows in the way present Delusive hues, when on ourselves intent. 154 Cunning will rob thee, treachery will defraud, But deem the gem they steal an empty gaud. 155 Fret not thyself for loss thy virtues cause; But scorn the injury of defenceless laws. 156 Craft is not wisdom; sharpness is not light; Fools can defraud; the dull and hard can bite. 157 From thy lone cell, in cover of neglect, Thou mayst shoot radiance, and the world direct. 158 If in the closet wise, thou canst not face Stupor's hard visage, solitude embrace! 159 The busy hours, when th' intellectual ray Is sent to gather knowledge, fly away. 160 There is no lassitude, no gathering gloom, Where in the mind's pure garden visions bloom. 161 The songs of mind, if not of essence pure, Like other worldly joys, will not endure. 162 Can reason or can wisdom hold the rein Over the temper, or corporeal vein? 163 Cast in a genial mould, by Nature blest, Some ever nurse the sunshine of the breast. 164 If the mind's rays are neither strong nor bright, The heart throws up an ever-ruling light. 165 Guard well thy passions; or their mists will blind With error e'en the clearest, strongest mind. 166 Be not to envy nor to malice prone; Trust to thyself, and others' merits own. 167 Into the sores of others pour a balm; View thine own lot with candour, and be calm. 168 If thou art irritable at the rude Stir of the crowd, abide in solitude. 169 Oft is there virtue in obscure retreat; And wisdom talks in shades with accents sweet. 170 We lose in comfort what we win by fame; The fire of genius is a wasting flame. 171 The spleen at others has a deadly force, Which to ourselves is poison in its source. 172 Sober thy hopes, to gentle pleasures trust; False expectations end in cold disgust. 173 Often beneath the grave and downcast eye, Dark mischief, hate, and craft, and falsehood lie. 174 The scorn conceal'd, that, with vindictive ire, Broods in the heart, is Satan's cover'd fire. 175 Be on thy guard against the honied speech, For sweetest sounds too oft delusion teach. 176 The Syren sings upon enchanted shores, Where, backward in its cave, the tempest roars. 177 Serene, nor high in hope, nor deep in gloom, We pass in safety to the distant tomb. 178 Where flow the mighty waters loud and strong, Back they recede th' ingulphing rocks among. 179 Nurse not thy grief; the gleamy sunshine court; And in thy faith thou shalt receive support. 180 After the blackest night there comes a dawn; And when thou hopest least, the pall is gone. 181 The misty morning, as it clears away, Brings, with a double rapture, golden day. 182 The interchange of seasons cheers the sight;â Who Nature loves will live in pure delight. 183 Trees with bare branches, as in foliage, dress'd, Nature in grandeur, as in grace attest. 184 Stern Winter, in her most tempestuous sounds, More charms the lofty list'ner than astounds. 185 The whisp 'ring breezes that our eyelids close, But lull us to undignified repose. 186 To labour born, our fellow-man to aid, We must not be to idleness betray'd. 187 To waste our being in incessant rest On beds of roses, deadens pleasure's zest. 188 The stagnant pool, by storms and rains unmoved, The fountain of disease has ever proved. 189 So pain and grief diversify our lives; And he has most of joy who hardest strives. 190 Strength with our struggle, spirit with our woe, Blaze with the blowing storm, to splendor grow. 191 There is an art, by wisdom's lessons taught, Which blesses life by discipline of thought. 192 Where in opinion intellect is wrong, Conscience is weak, and blindfold will is strong. 193 Light in the brain, and kindness in the heart, A lamp to ev'ry maze of life impart. 194 Hard is the brain, nor into fire will burst, If in the bosom's fountain not immersed. 195 Angry nor pleased the sly the world beguile; Who, in their sullenness, can wear a smile. 196 A bosom cold is suited well to go Safe through the world in cover of its snow; 197 But in its safety let it not rejoice; It cannot bound or thrill at Pleasure's voice. 198 To nurse the good, and to repress the ill,â This is the duty man may best fulfil. 199 The mingled web incessant care demands: Blest he who separates with nicest hands. 200 Blind to our faults, unconscious of our stains, We smile, untouch'd by cruel Pride's disdains. 201 Delusion sometimes is a kind disguise: Who cannot shun the grief, may shut the eyes. 202 By thine own griefs, the griefs of others learn: He shall know ills of sternness who is stern. 203 Thou canst not keep the pains of life away; For thee, though thou exult, will come the day! 204 Trust not thy wealth, for wealth has wings to fly; Shorn of false strength, thou then must faint and die. 205 A self-dependence only calm can breed; The borrow'd strength will shun our call at need. 206 Earth's coarser mould, whose particles sustain Our mortal part, disturbs and clouds the brain. 207 Fresh air, the fertile soil's odorous smell, On the pure senses have a magic spell. 208 From dewy earth sweet exhalations rise, And in half-glittering vapours reach the skies. 209 From the moist grass the drops of pearly hue, Aurora's incense, it is joy to strew. 210 Who by no meditation tills his brain Light, as on sand, will sow his seed in vain. 211 Enrich'd by borrow'd stores, and by the dews Of Heaven refresh'd, it deepens all its hues. 212 For Virtue's list thou wilt not have a part, Stern in thy thoughts, unbending in thy heart. 213 Search thy deep bosom; hope is not secure, If in its inmost shrine all is not pure. 214 Outwardly fair their looks the cunning form, While all within is mischief, fire, and storm. 215 Among the deadliest sins of bad mankind, Hypocrisy shall no forgiveness find. 216 He whose clear mind with Virtue's charms is clad, Will love the lovely, and repulse the bad. 217 Duty by habit is to pleasure turn'd; He is content who to obey has learn'd. 218 The boaster most opposes common sense; All turn deaf ears, or sneer at his pretence. 219 Pride lives in surly grandeur; and who bow, Offer at Hatred's shrine a secret vow! 220 Insult no subject gains; beneath your feet The very worm will your aggression meet. 221 Who will not see, but lift his head in air, For his defenceless feet invites the snare. 222 Scorn raises foes, and Pride shall have a fall, And Heartlessness in vain for aid shall call! 223 The strongest and the brightest yet are weak; And all the help of fellow-man must seek. 224 When our frail outward being fades to night, E'en in the grave's sad brink be inward light! 225 A mind by thought enrich'd, by toil uprais'd, Is like the sky by solar radiance blaz'd. 226 When stagnant vapours cloud heaven's vault from sight, We pray in melancholy mood for light. 227 As when heaven's beams breaks thro' the mantle grey, We hail the radiant mind that clears the day. 228 The dull if they their selfish wills but have, Are reckless of the voice that haunts the grave. 229 All for the present, for the body all, No ear they offer to the Spirit's call. 230 If in the grave our ashes senseless lie, Why seek we Fame's kind plaudits when we die? 231 But man will murmur, as he breathes his last, âTears and soft requiems on my ashes cast!â 232 When life was quitting his exhausted frame, Did Bacon glory in his future fame? 233 With grievous breath perchance he seem'd to say, âMy star shall rise, my clouds shall fade away!â 234 Virtue and genius, wisdom, and great deeds, E'en these on earth shall gain reluctant meeds. 235 Our mortal state is, e'en among the best, With woe, and wrongs, and evil words opprest. 236 Yet to the good the path of thorns is smooth'd, By heavenly sounds the conscience clear is sooth'd. 237 Crime may exult a moment in success; But in the darksome night remorse will press. 238 From the repentant shriek we fly in vain; Dark bitter thought with poison eats the brain. 239 Do thine own work with calm; nor lose a day: Slumbers will speed thine hours of rest away. 240 The gradual pile upon thine hands will grow; And thou thyself by thine own tasks shalt know. 241 If on thy grave no epitaph is trac'd, Thy toils shall be on Memory's tablets plac'd. 242 Fret not thyself distinction's mark to win; All peace, all joy, all comfort lies within. 243 If calm is not within the secret heart, All is a bubble in the outward part. 244 Is there a mortal who can scorn defyâ Cries of the mob or insults of the high? 245 Neglect is chilling; scoffs with active ire Vex every nerve, and rouse Revenge's fire. 246 In solitude the breast may be at peace, Safe from the fitful stings of man's caprice. 247 Opinion shifts as wanton as the wind, And in man's praise no anchor we can find. 248 O never on the people's breath rely; Trust it, and like the driving clouds 'twill fly. 249 He pleases most, who nought superior shews, Our envy to disturb, or self-repose. 250 We love a light, not toilsome, staff for stay, Which, at our pleasure, we may throw away. 251 The strong fatigue us, and the bright out-glare; The dazzle of the sun we cannot bear. 252 Not to the fever of the fiery mind, Not to the blaze of hope is bliss assign'd. 253 The calm, the mild, the sober and obscure; These know the gentle pleasures that endure. 254 O dangerous pleasures, that to rapture rise: How soon they sink to lasting agonies! 255 Envy not, quiet soul, the poet's partâ The blaze of brain, the fever of the heart. 255 Thou hast thy joys of a serener dye, The calm soft tear, the unbewilder'd sigh. 256 O Fame! O subtle evanescent ray! Thou shinest but a moment, to betray! 257 In man how different is the light of mind; Yet are by fits the very wisest blind. 258 Relying on his lamp the proud man walks; Yet oft it sinks in darkness while he talks. 259 Happy in ignorance, in blindness brave, The stupid grope their passage to the grave. THE END.</field>
