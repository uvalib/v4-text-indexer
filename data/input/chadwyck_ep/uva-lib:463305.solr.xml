      <field name="fulltext">The booke of the pylgrymage of man. Prologue. Phebus out of gemini his course when he adualyd &amp; in y? crab gan take his mansyon. Leo approchynge with coloure vnpalyd. Ryght resplendaunte and by exaltacyon. Lyghtly in the stelyferall regyon. His face publyssynge by course naturall. The tyme of estas his season pryncypall. Whenne in a place of pleasure full royall. I stode beholdynge ferre and nere. Lokynge if Luna by power potencyall. At thapposycion appere wolde clere. Marstnes sursesynge as tyme it were The name of whiche place where I drewe nere. Callyd is the pryory of lyousmynystre. Merueylouse moch musynge some matter to here Monstryouse in sentence wherby I myght My mynde besy to compounde clere. Theffect therof and hit to wryghte A volume I founde that in prose was pyghte. Of scripture by auctorytie grounded. Abstract and .l. drawen by master hendred. O famouse prelat with prudence perseueryd. Thy name of god is grounded oonly. For lyke when a henne small cr?mys hath gathered Then clokketh she her chekyns hastely They herynge the sounde of breste naturally. Folowe and fede this thynge is credyble. Ryght so of thy name the formoure syllable. Thou dost accomplysshe and of no parable. Thy mynde settynge but of grete auctorytie. In all thy werkes full c?mendable. Bothe plesaunte to hyghe and lowe degree Scripture gatherynge ensessauntely. In prose compylynge all and some. Compylynge sens of gostely wysdome. Lyke as by grete expresse mensyon In the glose recytyth Mathewe. Of heimes the naturall dysposycion. The chaptoure admyttyd vicesimo tercio. Of the scrutacion thou dost right so. The tenure amonge people publysshe ouer all. Of grace and vertue aduocate pryncypall And for synguler ensample to people vniuersall. Thynge prouyd and approbate appereth in syght. By thy lybrary who so sercheth fynde shall Gostely frute and pathe to the heuenly lyght. Medycyns sanatyffe to suche as haue myght. By grace and connynge to beholde and se. Durynge theyr lyfe the better shall they be. Thus of thy name the formoure syllable. Firste comprehended of grete vertue is. But yet the secounde is more amyable. And gretlyer except aboue in celis. For drede of synne from man expellys And from all euyll doth hym declyne. Afforsynge to approche operacyons deuyne. Of drede ferther it is wryten full playne Who dredyth god wyll duely enquyre What thynge to his pleasure he may most attayne. And lyke wyse god graunteth his hole desyre Right so thou kendelyst full kyndly the fyre. Unkynd goste burnynge by corrupt synne putrified. The pathe makynge playne to the trynall godhed. O my grete vertues remayneth in the drede. As in the saulter resyteth Dauyd. Auctorysed by scripture for matter in dede. Uoluntatem timencium se faciet And so forth yet ferther he procedeth. Solempnely recytynge in the same salme. Beneplacitum est d?o timentes eum. Lo howe of grace hath god in one. Heime to drede Ioyntly Ioyned. For whose estate I aske a bowne. To criste abone be longe maynteynyd. In welth with prosperytte to be susteynyd. So that after this lyfe transytorye. Reigne he maye in the imperyall see. Nowe to my purpose I wyll me apply. Groundely the prose to peruse and se. Comprehended in the volume that before spake I Entendynge to compyle the sence and it wyll be. In metre roughe wherfore the trynytie Thre persons in one most of drede. I lowly praye my werke to spede Finis prologi. Howe man was of .viij. part? made. Ca. primo. After thauctorytie of phylozofers exylent. Groundely pused vnto a purpose parfyte Our formoure father adam by the father relucent. Was of .viij. part? parfytely knyt. As ensuynge appereth who lyste to rede it. Besechynge theym all with humble affeccyon. Of fautes corryptyble to take the correccyon. First oure father Adam by grete expresmencion. Of slyme de terra was create and made Whiche Ioyned the Ioynt? of his corpus in one Not lyght of metall but heuy and sad. Fat and fulsome and seldome glad. Suche nature hath erth wherof the body. Of mankynde is made as appereth full playnly. Of the ferefull wawes and water of the see. Made was his blode to renne in euery vayne. Both hye and lowe thorowe out the hole body. Which maketh man wysdom vnto hym to attayne With prudens &amp; ?seueraunce as philozofers sayne Lo of the see this is the very nature. Mankynde of mynde to make parfyte and sure. The thirde parte of man I shall do my cure. Playnly to expresse whiche namyd be his Ien. Of the sonne they were made I you ensure Whose power is resplendaunte in the spere celestyn By compasse of the zodyake but what was therin. Man by that parte shall desyre to apparayle. Hym selfe alwayes to procede vnto batayle. The .iiij. parte whiche is the wombe of man. In the whiche is worled the wynde of his body. Of the wynde it was made wherfore than. Lyght he shalbe as by that propretye Irefull and wrothe and of no Iocoundytie. Thus wynde of nature is lyght and yrefull. And man in no wyse can his nature adnull The fyfth parte wherof had man at his creacion. For that it pleased god cotigitacions inwarde. Hym for to graunte for a gode proteccion. Of the cloudes of heuyn his thought? were made. By the whiche in synne he is ofte tymes clade As borne on erthe to be lyght and lecherous In the syght of god synne moste contagyous. Now sueth the syxt part thing? right dolorous. That of man made was all the bones. As philozophers say by matter monstryous. Of issues corrupt of all maner stones. Whose nature to publysshe &amp; make pleyne at ones. Is for to be gredy moche gatherynge and couetouse And theuys condycions to vse outeragyous. Of man the vnderstandynge &amp; grete intelleccion. By wysdome modered with reason vniuersall Of the mone issueth suche is her condycyon. The .vij. parte of man a myttyd ouer all By vertue wherof right well knowe you shall Borne he is in batayle gretly to precede. Suche nature hath the mone as ye may here rede. The .viij. parte complete of all benyng curtosye. Comprehended in the father and lord sempiternall. Is how he create the soule of man truely. Of his owne superne spirite o god ouer all. What preuylege by thy myghty power supernall. Myght more haue be done for mannes saluacion. Then in thy see royall to graunte hym a mansion. Howe almyghty god put Adam to paradyse/and of his firste age. Ca. secundo. Whan the heuenly kynge and our father eternall. Our formour father adam had formate &amp; made. The perloure of paradyce pereles ouer all. He gaue hym to mansion and then hym bad. Take all the c?modyties that therin were had. Saue one frute that grewe there on a tree. Whiche he hym forbad in euery degree. The wylfulnes of adam by the mocion of Eue. Alas may we say that it fortuned so Atasted therof thus by grete repreef. Hym selfe and his issue he brought vnto wo. For from pleasure to payne scripture sayth so. By an aungell was he dryuen in to this wretche vale To all humanytie a full dredfull tale. Where with payne he labored vexacion and trouble. And all the hole issue that of hym gan pursue. Lyke wretches they wandred this thynge is credyble. As careyns right vncurtouse not knowyng their due. To their god and maker but as tyraunt? vntrue. They toke their owne mynd? not modered with reson. And as clerk? say they were gya?t? that season. Sighty stronge gryme &amp; gryffull vnto loke And there vnto deuoyde of wysdom and sapience For foles they were approbate as recordeth y? boke. Of the first age of man who lyste make pretence. It for to serche shall fynde that no prudence. Was permanent in the persones that vtterly denyed. The moste drad c?maundement of the myghty godhed. Lo pryde of al synne ?nnagmat to m?nes confusion These people adualyd to the vale of darkenes. So that the father of heuen toke vengeaunce soone. And drowned all the world for theyr vnfaythfulnes Saue noe and dyuerse mo as scripture doth expresse Whiche Ioyntely were of ryght perfyte lyuynge. For whome god graunted a saue garde abydynge Thus for theyr grete rudenes and infidelitie. To consumpcion they were brought as before is sayde In the yere from adam as apperyth right playnly Unto noe .ij. M. for matter in dede. With .CC.xl. fully completed. The whiche of man callyd is the firste age. As it is wryten by phylozofers sage The secounde age of mankynde and howe the Sonnes of Noe byldyd the Toure of Babylon. Ca. iij. From noe vnto Abraham as recordyth the byble. Of yeres were full .ix. hundred and forty. In the whiche season as thynge right vnpossyble The sonnes of noe buldyd so hy. The toure of babylon preposynge vtterly. By meanes of the same to assende vnto heuyn. So couetouse they were as apperyth full playne. Beholde here the secounde mortall vyse of synne Whiche corrupted the carcayse of humayne kynde. As best? vnsatysfyed they lay styll therin For the whiche the father as I rede and fynde Confused theym on erthe for that they were vnkynde. Not knowynge theym selfe but clymynge to hy. By couetouse constrayned so voluptuously. Lo thus the secounde age of mankynde. Frome noe vnto abraham as aboue is sayde Consumed was by couetouse haue this in your mynde. The trouth wherof can not be denayed. But for theyr rebuke they were gretely dysmayde. Yet neuertheles of mankynde the lynage. That tyme thorowe passed his secounde age. Howe man proceded his thyrde age and of the synkynge of Cyties. Ca. iiij. When the secunde age of man was past &amp; expyred The .iij. age aproched as aperyth by scripture From abraham to Moysen as ye may here rede Of yeres full .D.C. I yon do ensure. Accomplysshed was where grete mysaduenture. Dolorous in sentence to haue in c?munycacion. Ye and mirroure monstryouce to euery x?ynnacion. Was had in that season and in the same age. Why cyties for synne corruptly putryfyed. Sonke bothe hye and also lowe lynage. So haynyous it was in the syght of the godhed. And playnly to shewe you howe they were namyd. That one of theym hight Sodame. And that other by name Gomorra. And as I haue before breuely expressed. That god toke vengeaunce for theyr mysery. Yet lothe with .ij. doughters to his mercy he callyd. Ye and also the wyfe of lothe truely. But she in no wyse coude refrayne tho her iye But turnyd and lokyd the cyties vppon For the whiche she stondyth a salte stone. O mercyfull lorde moste hyest in trone. Thy marcy there sauyd suche as were thyne. And suche as rebellyd agaynst alone. Corruptyd with synne and laye styll therin. Tho theym dyd subdue o corpus celestyn What loste these people but onely gula. With the socoure of sua prole luxuria. How Moyses receyuyd ij. tables of the law in the .iiij. Age of man. Capitulo. v. From Moysen vnto Dauid the puyssaunt kyng: Of mankynde the .iiij. age full dyd contynue. In the whiche season without faute or lokynge. The children of Israell thorowe the red see dyd sue. That separate was by Moyses this thynge is true. Where pharro fersely with his power pursued. In the whiche he and his power breuely were drownyd Wherupon by the father of the celestyall see Receyuyd was .ij. tables of letters of the lawe. By moyses on the mounte of Synay so hye. All rigorouse demeanoure from man to withdrawe. His vyse to redres and his maker to knowe. For frome adam to Moysen the lawe of nature Full febly was ordred I you do ensure. For therin was non auctoure but all out of ordre. What thyng had so happenyd y? tyme in mannes m?de. He thought it was leyffull for hym and all other. So that tyme were sauyd full fewe as I fynde. But lytterate lawe reduced mankynde. In so moche he kepte it vnto the c?mynge. Of criste our souereygne sauyoure and heuenly kynge. How kynge Salamon byldy the temple of god in Ierusalem. Ca. vi. From Dauyd the kyng vnto the transmigracion Of Babylon as scripture by auctoryte doth specify And byldyd in a maner full merueylously. The temple of god in Ierusalem the Cytie. By kynge Salamon with Ioy and grete honoure. Whiche is to all people a full parfyte myrroure. But yet by pryde the very rote and grounde. Of synnes moste inordinate to manne saluacyon. After the sayde temple was buylded and founde. Ye and also ? iniquitatem principium. That moste was set by with all and some. Una cum lege diuine transgressionem. Ac diuersimodi prophetarum falsitatem The people of god were led in to Babylon. And .l. yere there they dyd remayne. Then Ieromias the profyte made lamentacion. And for by cause he sayde that was certayne. Cursed people to egypte dyd hym attayne. And there of trouth full tyrauntely. To deth hym stonyd vnmercyfully. Howe the .vi. age endured tell the commynge of our sauyoure. Ca. vij. The .vi. age of man ensue then dyd and come. Whiche pleynly to expres I shall do my cure. From babylon the captiuytie &amp; grete thraldome. Unto the c?mynge of our souereygne sauyoure. D.C. yeres is and somwhat ouer In whiche age was grete batayle murder. Bytwene the bretherne of Iudas and dyuerse other. Thus fynysshed I haue the .vi. age fully c?pleted. At the souerayne incarnacion of our sauyour crist Ih? In terminat sence yreuely compyled. Afforsynge to pronownce that perfyte is and true. After my copy and in metre renewe. The tenure of the same now lorde of myghtis moste. Me spede father sonne and also holy goste. The nombre of yeres from the begynnynge of the worlde to the bythe of criste. Ca. viij. From y? begynnyng of y? worlde vnto y? glorio? houre. That criste was incarnat of pure virgyne mary. Is of yeres fyue thousande a .C. &amp; .iiij. score And .vi. monethes ouer appereth full paynely. By seynt austeyne and other good auctours many. This tyme beganne thencreace of all goodnes. Thanke with prysynge be to our lorde Ihesus. I haue tretyd before of the ages of mankynde. By dyuerse yeres comprehended in to syx. And nowe the .vij I shall call to my mynde. Cordially there on my herte to enfyx In the whiche is dayly vsed nona lex. And to contryue I enteade by the same. Dyuerse maner of ages of mankynde by name. In .xij. comprehende to a parfyte purpose With the cause that man shold passe on pylgrymage. And for thentent I wyll it dysclose. Accordynge to myne auctoure of euery age. That grounded is by a phylozopher sage. Whose name in the prologe is recytedfull playne. Wowe to my purpose I wyll me constrayne. Howe almyghty god was pylgryme for .iij. causes/and howe he gaue mankynde ensample to doo his pylgrymage. Ca. ix. Seth by y? mighty power of our father su?nall With the holy goste by trynall prouycion Dyscended hath oure sauyoure criste coequall. In mary his mother and for oure redempcion. From oure mortall foo to be tuic?n. Of her naturall corpus he was incarnat. And she hym conceyuyd as virgyn immaculate Hym selfe admyttynge of no hye estate. But as a pylgryme apparayled in his gere Thoughe his see celestyall hyghly was sublymat. He was for thre causes as ye may rede here Appoynted lyke a pylgryme as by scripture dothe apere. O ben?g Ih? thus haue we gret auctoritie. To call the our creature and lambe of humylitie. The firste cause that he a pylgryme was and why Lyke as a pylgryme many hospitalles doth seke. Right so in the wombe of his mother mary Full out .ix. monethes he dyd tumble and crepe Thyrtie yere in this world he was and more eke. And in the sepulture .xl. houres he lay This was the firste cause without ony nay. The secounde is where that euery day. A pylgryme opteyneth right grete aduersyties. Somtyme by tempest dogges &amp; theuys by the way So oure sauyoure ih? durynge his erth dayes. Was subiect to aduercyte manyfolde wayes. For after his byrthe he some full on wepynge. Consyderynge the trouble that to hym was ensuyng The thirde cause was if ye duely hede take. For .iij. signes that doth belonge to a pylgryme. That is to saye his scrip his staffe and his hat. But our sauyoure Ih? toke vpon hym. In stede of his staffe a crosse full gryme For his hat he toke of thorne a crowne. And for his script a spere of stele browne. O god gloryfyed in the heuenly trone. What more for man myghtest thou haue done. Thenne for to suffer so grete passyon. On caluery the mounte with grete affeccyon. The soule of man couetyng from sathanas d?acion Meke as a lambe that lowe were of lynage. On caluery full kyndly thou dydest thy pylgrymage. Thus to brynge vs from Lucyfers damage. By simylytude of thyne owne persone. Lyke a pylgryme y? apperedest our sorow to swage. Techynge vs pylgrymes how we shold done. For that this worlde is no sure mansyon. But frayle and fletynge lowe and hye Why man of erth made is create to dye. whiche .iij. synguler poynt? appertayne to a pylgryme. Ca. x. Now syth pylgrymage is moste approbate. For mannes soule the welth vniuersall. If thre thing? he kepe in his pylgrymage gate. That to pylgrymes ?tendyth in this worlde ouerall Firste humble vesture on his corpus carnall Secundely in ordynate takynge for to refuce. And the thirde from vanyties his iyes to abuse Thenne if he duely these thre do peruse. He optayne shall the blysse by due enhabytaunce. Wherfore I mankynde my synnes to excluse. To pylgrymage gyue my hole affyaunce. On my purpose to procede with gostely substaunce. Wherfore I entende to puruey a gouernoure. My guyde to be thorowe the realme of aduenture. Fortune my guyde if it were her pleasure. Myght right well be and frendely to me. But stedfast to haue her it is a cure That in no wyse wyll approued be And seth suche grete duplycytie. In her is permanent I wyll refrayne. The felysshyp of her tell we mete agayne. Yet a guyde I wyll attayne. In place where euer I can hym fynde. Worldly wysdome were good certayne. For to be guyde vnto mankynde. But his also lucrus of mynde. That dysceyue he wolde oure company. And oure stokke enbessell secretely. Of suche a guyde beware wyll I. For he is no thynge mete ne profytable. Of mannes soule the welth truely. Thoughe to this worlde he be agreable. And where ryches is moste exceptable For nowe a dayes where so euer I come. Namyd is falshed worldly wysdome. Therfore betyme nowe all and s?me. Of his croked company I wyll forsake. And for to passe this ferefull regyon. A better guyde to me wyll I take. The whiche by the way me mery wyll make. By mynstralsy of moche myght. Beatus vir my guyde shall hyght Nowe thanke I hyghly the lanterne of lyght For chosen I haue me a perfyte guyde. On my passage to gouerne me right. The holy trynyte be my spede. Of whome I take my leue this tyde. For in his cytie I had grete chere. In the delectablyst season of all the yere. Howe mankynde enteryth the londe of Iune at the age of .lx. Ca. xi. Than was I in my hyghest power. And sol moste hotest in his spere celestyn. Metely lusty at the age of thre score My pylgrymage duly for to optayne. For cancer then ouer me dyd reygne. Thus went I forth with myrth and game. Folowynge my guyde blessed by name. Thorowe this countrey of royall fame. And of pleasures precyouce full plenty to se. For gretely I was refresshed by sight of the same. Ye and moreouer I ete dyd plenteously. Strawberyes and cheryes wherof that countrey. Was full planteouse in euery lane. And so were passed by the same. Thenne towarde a goodly coste we came. That by the Pope of Iune was holden. Where the clenyst catell in cristendome. Full ryche we sawe and well be sene Enquyrynge what was the name then. Of that place whiche by benyuolence. There graunted was so grete indulgence. Anone we perceyuyd by grete experyence. That this catell whiche was so hye. By potencyall power of superne audyence. Namyd is the castell of corpus x?i. Of whiche indulgence by auctorytye. The founder is called by naturall sext. Of the romaynes romanus pontifex. To whose bullys dyd marteyne annex. Augmentacion with encrease of more. Indulgence to that castell as the tex Bereth well wytnes man to restore. From worldly wretchednes and synfull sore. Thus lefte we that Castell and way dyd take Farther on our Iourney vs mery to make. Thenne vir beatus me made forsake. His pathe wherin he vsed to go. Wyllynge me shortly my mynde to breke Unto dominus illuminatio And of his fauoure desyre so. That thorowe all londes where we shold lyte. Graunte vs he wolde a saffe condyte. So for to purchas a parfyte wryte. To soule Iusticie we toke oure way Sealed to haue oure saffe condyte. And he shortly sayde not nay. But also haue vs of his lyuerey. A fencyble garment Ioyntely compyled. With fayth and hope that we exiled Sholde not be and yet besyde. He made vs drynke of his maluesay Us to comforte so in that tyde. We departed and on our Iourney. None we doubted but toke the way. This maluesay to vs so comfortable was. Our hertes lyghtenynge with dropis of grace. Procedynge forthe and by a shorte space. We sawe a comely gay Monastery. A c?modyouse thynge and a fresshe place. That strawed was full plesauntely. With rysshes grene right amyably I asked of whome this place was prest And my guyde sayde of seynt Ioh? Baptyst. In exposycion auctorysed by scripture of the c?cepcyon of seynt Ioh? Baptyst. Ca. xij. So to that place we hyed vs with haste. Duely enquyryng the maner of this seynt. A partie moche merueylynge and euyn at the laste We sawe how an aungell from heuen was sent. Gabryell by name whiche saunce entent Sayde to zacharias that euer was in oryson. Fere thou no thynge for graunte is thy petycion. And thy wyfe Elyzbeth shall brynge to the a sonne. Whose name shalbe Ioh? that Ioy and grete gladnes. Shall be to the ye and grete congregacion. Of people shall Ioy in his byrth for suernes. That he shalbe takyn of so pure perfitens. In the sight of the godhed in the by trone This highly shalbe magnyfied thy only s?ne Ioh? Then answered zacharias right shortly and soone. How may it be true this tale that thou hast tolde Seth youth away is fletyd and fro me clene gone. My natoure away wasted and I am very olde. My wyfe also past temynge this dare I be bolde. The aungell answered sythe that thou sayst so. Tyll thy chylde be borne dombe thou shalt go We there taryed no lenger but left hym euyn so. Passyng on our pylgrymage thorugh this countre. Roses and lyllyes plenty seynge blowe. Flouryssynge theym selfe full fayre for to se. So on oure passage pryuely passed we. Towarde the palayce of peter and Poule. When oute of cancro passed was soule. Where that we dronke of a blacke boll. By a fyre there full fresshely made. The tyme when the cloke dyde .viij. toll At nyght suche chere there we had. That cause we founde none for to be sad Farther on oure Iourned then we paste And sodenly euyn at the laste. How mankynde enteryth in to a kyngdome namyd the londe of Iuly &amp; parte of the martyrdome of seynt Thomas of Cauntorbery. Ca. xiij. To Iuly the monyth we dyd vs haste. In the whiche soule dyscended from his stacion. Then my nature beganne for to waste. Lyke as dyd the hete of the sonne. For then age approched and plucked me downe. My braynes were febled my wyt waxed thyne My age was then .lx. yere and tenne But yet at the lest I bethought me then. But pylgrymage to procede howe so euer I dyd. Then a mountayne I sawe that was passynge dyme. And was sore affrayed but breuely I asked. My guyde what thynge it myght betyde. And he me answered without delaye. That of seynt Ioh? it was the .viij. daye. So breuely we sawe in a lowe valey. A byshoppys place that rychely was dyght. Thy therwarde streyte takynge the way. We enquyred howe this bysshope hyght. But there we founde none erthly wyght. That coulde vs tell the Bysshoppys name. Nor well from what coste that he came. We then perceyuyd what it dyd meane. That whan by degre in man in eleuate. His formoure surname is take in vayne. And so exyled and put a parte. Yet or this bysshop came to his estate. As we vnderstode by certayne there. Named he was doctoure prayoure A noble prelate and a grete prechoure. By vertue wherof he came to hygh degre. Grace beynge his guyde and grete socoure By the helpe of the holy trynytie. Thus towarde the palayce we passed prymalye. Of this bysshop to haue a syght. But hym to se we had no myght. Then herde we saye in harnes bryght. Foure men that were of the kyng? house. Hasted theym by daye and nyght. Theyr myscheuouce mynde right dolorouse. On this bysshop and myrroure monstryouce. Thacomplysshe with grete wreth. Hym to bereue from lyfe to deth. Thus of theyr purpose they neuer toke breth But whyles this bysshop in prayer was knelynge. Byfore an aulter as scripture sayth. Thenne violently as tyraunt? wyllynge. Theyr purpose to pursue with wepyns vnsyttyng. By one assent full cruelly. Stroke at this bysshop &amp; dyd hym to dye. And as playnly of trouth herde I One of the tyraunt? that had the dede done. This bysshop brought vp from infancye. Unto mannes state and as his godsone. O in hym lacked grace with manly reasone. His godfather to stryke so violently. That brought hym vp full tenderly. Thenne for this case we were right sory. And with deuocyon knelyd downe. Prayeng to criste on the soule to haue mercy. Of this gostely holy fycysyon That fynysshed we rose of soone. Enquyrynge where was the bysshoppys obsequi. And they vs shewed at Cauntorbury. The breuer and shortlyer tyme knewe we. What he was when we knewe the name. Certayne of the place where tombed was he Of Cauntorbery seynt Thomas it was the same. Then louyd we criste moste myghtyest of fame. And on oure vyage toke oure way. In conceytes vs delytynge the sothe for to say. A parable of auctoritie of the holy ordre of seynt Benet. Ca. xiiij. So shortly we came to a royall abbay. Full fayre goodly and comely set. Plesaunte to loke on euery way. Whiche place is callyd without let. The holy monastery of seynt Benet. So we shortly with all oure myght. Toke oure lodgynge before the nyght. Euyn at the abbay gate right. Where I wysshed to haue ben away. Longe or euer it was day lyght. For so huge a noyse and so meruaylouse array. Herde I neuer by nyght nor day. What with syngynge and ryngynge of bellys. Slepe I coulde not in no wyse. And as we thought it was a guyse. Not conuenyent in no good place. Oute of tyme to make suche noyse And specyally when that it was. Of naturall rest the tyme and space. At mydnyght for all gode men. To slepe and no suche werk? begyn. For and if that aboue in heuyn. The noyse were so odyble as to vs it was. But lytell thanke sholde they wyn. As we thought for in that place. Preseruyd is euer perpetuall peace. And to oure herynge and syght in warde. Easely thyther it myght be harde Than the purpose shortly we pondered Of houre myndes breuely entendynge. In to this abbay with yen blere yed. And hedys full ydle for ouer watchynge. To take oure way in mynde meruaylynge What maner of men and people they were. That kepte suche rule thorowe out the yere And with that there dyde full shortly appere. Personally present before oure syght. A man right meruaylouse in all his gere. Apoynted solempnely and then with myght. We enquyred howe his name hyght. He answered and sayde he hyght contemplacion. The parfyte pathe to the heuenly regyon. We asked hym yet shortly this questyon. What meane myght that fulsome case. That by nyght tyme was made and done. In so gay a Monastory and fayre place. And what they were that neuer dyd sease. Theyr grete rumoure and longe syngynge And why with bellys they made suche ryngynge. He answered vs with wordes right syttynge. What meanyth this noyse I shall yeu tell. To criste in heuen it is well pleasynge And all the fendes power of hell. Adnychyll it doth euery deall. And of what maner thyse men be Walke in my sonne thou shalte theym se. Thus shortly he toke his leue of me. Thenne came my guyde beatus vir. And bad me folowe hym hastely. So in to that place he brought me nere. Where we sawe present personally appere. Dedely persones of coloure right pale I seynge theym my coloure dyd aduale. Consyderyng theyr rule some and all. So ryotously ordred in euery degre. Meruaylynge moche who was the pryncypall. Gouernoure of that goodly see That suffred suche rule encessauntly. For as me thought it were more right To slepe all day then wake all nyght. And as we behelde this dedely sight. Rounde aboute in euery degre. We sawe howe that by hostely myght. Thyse men that dyd appere dedely. Had .vi. wynges redy to flye. Lyke vnto thaungellys cheruphyn That he enhabit aboue in heuyn. And when of vertue they so dyde shyne. Then knew I by parfyte experience. That my guyde present had bene Full often personall in theyr audyence. And so with vertue we left theyr presence. Hertely praynge my holy guyde. That on our passage we myght procede. Procedynge forth a well good spede. Sol in Leone by course existynge We hyed vs faste and matter in dede. Passe we dyde by a full goodly thynge. That virgyn vas pure and parfyte of lyuynge. Whose name was callyd without lette Holy marter and virgyn Margarete. Then on our waye farther we sette And by Magdaleyne shortly we came A blessed woman that wysshed the fete. Of our sauyoure Ihesu callyd by name. And with her here wypyd the same. Whose name as scripture doth playnly sho Auctorysed was a Magdalo castro. And so to the place of compostellane. Where Iames lyeth the appostell holy. We passed and by blessed Anne. That mother is knowen to virgyn mary And there my guyde by and by. Made me shortly with dixi custodiam. To be acquaynted a full goodly man. That in the bysshoppys courte was tane. Gretely in fauoure and by reputacion. Was holden right a worshypfull man. And after acquayntaunce by c?munycacion. He shewed vs that the dysposycion. In that londe at many dyuerse season Was for to ete benes and peason. To ferther costes we toke oure mocion. Oure ferefull pylgrymage for to fulfyll. Enterynge in to the myghty regyon. That duely is holden by grete skyll. At the Emperoure of Augustus wyll. For royally he reigneth therin at pleasure. In the fructuouste season of all the yere. Howe be it that tyme I dyde drawe nere Me to prouyde for the sustenaunce in age. Both corne of the erth and frutes of all maner. For nowe am I .xxiiij. both wyse and sage. Whether that I be of hye or lowe lynage. I muste haue me to fynde ensuynge yere by yere. For drade that pouerty me brynge vnto daunger. Howe mankynde entereth the empyre of August and of the abundaunte welth that there is. Ca. xv. Lo august of vertue doth gretely appere. Aboue all other bothe est and west. For in that londe nother sowe ne ere. No man doth but as they luste. For they repe and mowe in euery coste. This londe of plentie with pleasure is so mete. That whete lyes vnder euery mannes fete. There the firste that we set on sight By name was callyd the cytye of Lammas. Where petyr pope by veray right. Was wrongfully inprysoned in that place. Thenne my guyde in right shorte space. Made vs acqueynted with one right wyse. Whose name was callyd quid gloriaris. That coo?cyner admytted was. With themperoure of this fructuouse londe. So thense we parted and by a place. Of seynt Laurence paynted rounde. With gyrdyrons and in that stounde. We vs be thought so in conclucyon. To the grete abbay of thassumpcion. Strayte we went and passe that mancyon Without ony taryeng only there. And by Bartylmewe were straunge fassyon. He had brought vp as dyd appere For all his skynne was of clere. And on his arme he dyde it caste. As one that was not moche agaste. Forth farther on our way we paste. And to a goodly cytie hyghe we dyde. By seynt Austeyns place and at the laste By medry? we came where matter in dede. We syghte had of seynt Iones hede. That done without delaye. To a nother londe we toke the waye. Howe mankynde entereth/and goeth thorowe the Dukedome of September. Ca. xvi. Some to a dukedome the pathe laye. Septembre namyd the ryche duchery. In the whiche is made the sothe to saye Wyues mankynde to refresshe truely. For then nature away doth clye And as I tell you mankynde is than. Of yeres full .iiij. score and tenne Febylytie man than faste c?meth on. He waxeth croked vnneth go he canne. Lyke as wynter approcheth this season. So playnly it appereth yerely by man. But neuertheles when we thyther came. Dixit insipiens we dyde fynde there. Thorowe all that londe a right grete doer. And when I it sawe I meruayled sore. Howe and what wyse it come myght to passe A vnwyse man to haue suche power. Ouer all suche a countrey as it was. Thenne shortely I sawe howe stode the case. Scripture when I serched the trouth to knowe. In the epistelys of poule libro primo. Ad corintios capitulo tercio. That the wysdome of this world before the godhed. For folysshenes is taken and seth it is so. Me thought is name right well myght be suffred. So there we hym lefte and farther proceded. And solempnely we came erely on a morne To the place where the mother of crist was borne. And strayte we wente to the exaltacion. Of the holy crosse without delay. Frome thense procedynge on our pathe full sone. To the ryuer of ymber this is no nay. Where ouer we rowed then on our Iourney On fote for fallynge we dyd vs hy Unto the Monastory of seynt Mathy. Assendynge soone thense full hastely. Unto the hye mounte of seynt Myghell. Where we dyd fynde certaynly. That Myghell was archaungell Thenne no lenger there wolde we dwell. As in that londe but walked nere. To warde the Erledome of October. Howe mankynde entereth in to the londe of October at the age of a .C. yere. Ca. xvij. And when there entered farre we were. My legges waxed feble &amp; I lackyd myght. For then wad I full oute a hunderde yere. And when there entred farre we were. Unneth I coude go so fayled my sight My way to se by day nor by nyght. Uery feble suche state had I. When phebus caste his lyght lewly. Yet in this londe men full besy were. The erth to ere and corne to sowe Theym to fynde a nother yere. Thenne parfytely well myght we knowe. It was that thynge muste nedys be do The tyme whan phebus casteth his lyght. Towarde the scorpyon accordynge to right. So eur purpose to fulfyll pertly procedynge. Delytynge our lyfe right Iocoundely. Blakberyes plumbes and nuttes etynge. That in that londe was nothynge deyntye. But in euery hedge appered right goodly. And in this londe there was abydynge. A solempne man and a well lyuynge. The whiche was callyd without lesynge Saluum me fac with whom my guyde. Shortly and sodeynly euyn at the metynge Was very well and passyngly well acquented. Thenne on warde on our way we hyed. Lerned men and lawyars seynge full besy. In kepynge of courtes of euery degre. Howe mankynde entereth the barury of Nouember. Ca. xviij. From thense procedynge and so shortely. Entre we dyde bothe in fere. With payne full grete on my partie. In to the Baruery callyd nouember. For lew and wan waxed my chere. As nature trees in the crop doth fayle That the leues therof away doth sayle Right so I lykyn my worldly trauayle, Whan youth is wasted and age is come. Thenne doth deth drawe nere me to assayle. My welth fayleth gone is my wysdome. Lyke as from hete adualyd is the sonne. In this season yere by yere ensuynge. In lyke wyse it fareth by me in all thynge. For strenght is gone &amp; my power is as nothing. My wyte is wanted as hete of the sonne. My nature is wasted as trees in theyr wanynge. My welth my Iolytie my pryde is clene gone. Yet nedys must I age at his c?mynge welcome. For but I anone wyll in dede ellys where. My age is a .C. nowe and ten yere But for to speke more of this matter On oure pylgrymage boldly forth passed we. By the abbay of all holon I you ensure. Anone in that parties we sawe there suerly. Men in that countrey to sow full besy Thenne made my guyde me acquaynted to be. With one whose name was exultate. That with the barne of this barury Amyttyd is a grete ruler. Thorowe that londe and contynently. We walked by a mynyster. Well appoynted in euery where. And as we vnderstode it was callyd by name. The Bysshopryche of seynt Martyne. Where we mette Bysshoppys tweyne. That Edmunde that archebysshop hyght. That other hew Bysshop of Lyncolne. Thenne asked we with all oure myght. If in the way we were right. Unto the lordshyp of December. And they sayde ye do you not fere The day passynge the nyght drawynge nere. By pope clement takynge oure way. We sawe a virgyne whose body clere. With rasers was raced saunce delay. That bounde was to a whele this herde we say The name that callyd was this virgyne. Proprely is sayde marter Katheryne. Thenne by one redely we came. That had his membrys quadrauntangly. Drawen on a Crosse andrewe by name. And shortly thense we passed by. Thorowe oute all this grete baruery. Whose name naturall is Nouember. Enterynge streyte the lordshyp of December Howe mankynde entereth the lordshyppe of December Ca. xix. Nowe be we passynge thorowe the power Of December the lordshyp myghty. Where my guyde sodeynly there. Made me acqueynted with Cantate. But yet as far as I coulde se. Est west North South and south by It was but euyn a barayne country. A right good cause and wot ye why For the sonnes is descended to his lowest degre. In this season and shyneth full lewly For lower on erth can no man hym se And euyn right so it fareth by me For no hete haue I what sholde I saye more. I am nowe of yeres full oute syx score. Yet holde I well tell I maye no more On my pylgrymage way my lyfe durynge Passynge this monyth as I sayde before. Where we sawe men right sore laborynge. To molyfy theyr londes in dunge caryenge. Thenne hasted we forth with besy cure. Unto the myghty see callyd Aduenture. And euyn shortly when we came there Anone we toke shyppynge and sayled at wyll Fysshe ynough etynge and makynge good chere. We sawe in the myddes of this see stande an yle. Full properly pytched vpon a pyle. I asked my guyde what was that place. And he me answered howe that it was. An I londe that of seynt Nicholas. Callyd it was the bysshopryche. Frome that coste thenne dyd we passe. By an abbay I neuer sawe suche I asked of whome byldyd was the churche My guyde me answered shortly and soon. Sayeng of our lady it was the concepcion. So vp vnto the mounte of wysdome. We assendyd and came by an hospytall. That namyd was saynt Thomas mansyon. Shortly then passynge with pleasure at all Ouer this see with myndys cordyall Lowly thankynge the hy holy trynyte That passed we had that grete Ieberdye. Safe and sounde in euery degre. So we londyd and ancre cast. It cristmas the myghty cytie Where eueryman kept grete feste. With brede and ale and mete of the best. And all for Ioye that a mayden free. Borne had a childe of hye degree. And when of that tydyng? the trouth herde we. I mused in my mynde and meruayled moche. Thenne .iij. shepardes shortly shewed me. That as to that childe none lyke was suche. In all this worlde and who lyste to serche. Shall fynde this childe so resplendaunte. To the kyngdome of heuen heyre apparaunte. Yet I meruayled with thoughtes abundaunte. Why this childe so lowly lay. In a crache where bestes recyaunte. Were takynge theyr fode both strawe and hay. Anone my guyde dyde take his way. Shortly to speke with d?e exaudi. That nyghe kynne was vnto Cantate. And I hym folowed full dylygently More of this babys byrthe to here. And when the trouth of all herde I. I purposed veryly to approche nere. The kyngdome of heuen to all my power My guyde quyckely aduysed me then. To passe on my purpose and spye a new tyme. So passyng forth on our Iourney procedynge. Thorowe that lordshyp as the path lay There were founde withoute ony lesynge. A full longe nyght and but a shorte day. And this one thynge we dare well say. In parte of this countre we sawe theym amonge. The day lytle ouer passed .vi. houres longe From the s?ne arysyng tell the s?ne goyng downe Ferther yet procedyng at one thyng meruaylynge. What maner of slaughtoure in y? lordshyp was done. For lyke as with a beste in maner is the dealynge. So on a m?nes hed they neuer stynte knockynge With grete stones tell all his braynes. Aboute his sholders lay at oones Another they dressed in as euyll maners. For wasshe hym they dyd in bollynge oyle. And more ouer toke oute of cardes. Yonge infauntes and theym dyde spyll With theyr sperys a syght full euyll. And to make festes by suche dealynge To oure semynge it was vnsyttynge. And to trete farther of this maner of thynge.

Wherfore on my soule good lorde haue mercy. For my synnes dedely Ihesu nowe I crye. All mankynde is mortall and made for to dye. Wherfore mankynde of thy mysse the remembre. And thynke thou this worlde is full transytory. And euer amonge haue mynde of thy maker. Thus leue I of this lyfe and loke for a better. Wherfore mankynde my brother I the pray. Contynuelly remembre thy endynge daye. Howe mankynde entereth y? londe of Ianuary and of the strasty of that coste. Ca. xx. All naked &amp; bare to this worlde am I come. On pilgrimage to procede I purpose if I can Without strenght connynge or naturall reason. And to tell you trouth mankynde I am In innocency by crist?dom to attayne me a name. For lyke I am to the monyth of Ianuary. In the whiche I begyn my pylgrymage truely. For in that monyth as appereth full playnly. Nothynge groweth but all is full barayne. Right so of no strenght nor connynge am I. Wytte nor wysdome I can none attayne. But yet procede I wyll in certayne. On pylgrymage to my persone accordynge. Thorowe this monyth wherin growyth nothyng. With humble affeccion my guyde besechynge To shewe me the gouernoure of all Ianuary. Anone me he answeryd without lesynge. That exchetoure he was callyd of that countrye. And myght be callyd by auctorytie. Of all that countrey so excheted was. That no good was lefte in neuer a place. Saue frost and snowe and yse as glasse. Slepyr I now both on londe and water. But then we herde in a certayne place Two men with staues lay fast togyther. And shortly then we hyed vs thyther. To loke what maner of chaunce sodayne. That was fallyn bytwene theym twayne. And when we came there we sawe certayne. They betynge were wete oute of the sheues That they had purchased in the realme. Of the Emperoure of Augustus. And as we sawe bothe theyr staues. Were brokyn in the myddys and then to gyther. Tayed they were with thoug? of lether. hus thyse men from the coulde wether. Kepte theym selfe with laboure sore. So shortly in a whyle after. We passed farthe more and more. On oure Iourney and as we were there. Anone in acqueyntaunce god brought vs. With one that hyght Dixit dominus. Syttyng on the right handes as Iustyce of pease Of the myghty lorde in the grete Cytie. Of the circumsicion and from them dyde we passe. By coleyne there as be kynges thre. And by many other places that bene in haue we. Whiche were to longe processe for to be tolde. But shortly from that cost we pykkyd vs for colde. Howe mankynde enteryth the londe of February. Ca. xxi. Thenne to a coste the way dyd we holde. That namyd was the londe of february. And there my guyde my spryt? dyd bolde. Byddynge me loke rounde aboute me. And marke well beati immaculati. For he in this londe is cheyf gouernoure. And of all men ruler and guyder. Yet and nexte hym is moste of power. A noble Shyryffe and a myghty. That is callyd bothe fere and nere. Master legem pone. So in this londe we sawe men besy. For to stop gappes in hedges euery where. That by thexchetoure of Ianuary distroyed were. For by his extort meanes as dyde appere. Brought they were and dryuen to defecit. So all this company we lefte there. Anone we sawe mirabilia fecit. Hauynge a childe in his armys of trouth. We then of that childe duely enquyred. He answered it was the sonne of the godhed. Thenne glad was my herte I lefte vp my hed. Beholdynge the coste of euery countrey. And howe the grounde grenyd in euery mede. Remembrynge that I waxed to thage of .xx. Wysdome to lerne and counnynge to apply. By encrease of the same as this monyth dose. The grounde make grene to brynge forth floures. Right so after Ianuary the stormy shoures. In february I but as braunches on tree. The day then is lenghthed by full .ij. houres. And phebus assendaunte to his hyghe degre. From pisces to aries resplendauntly. A party hote lyke wyse euyn by me. I som what take of euery degre. Howe men procedyth his pylgrymage in/and thorowe the londe of Marche. Ca. xxij. So in our pylgrymage farther we passed. In pleasure delytynge vs all and some. So in to the londe of Marche we entred Where Ad d?m c? tribularer bat vs welcome. And also leuaui with letatus sum. Ye and vnder hym a stewarde goodly. That callyd is domine probasty. A myghty post in all that countrey Was he taken but what as therin My yeres then encreased vnto thyrty. I waxed stronge to fyght with a wepyn. I was in my Iolytie in all that season. To be goodly arayed I had grete affeccyon. Why in that age it is mannes condycion. But neuerthelesse of many a good mancyon. Set in this countrey I tell you playne. The people were besy for to sowe peson. Otes and barley for very certayne. Ye and trees graffynge in euery vayne Where good erth is approued requysyte. In all this countrey suche is theyr delyte. Laborynge sore as men that haue myght In euery where theym selfe besyeng. To euery true man a right good sight. Thenne shortly dyde we take shyppynge. At the hauen of right parfyte lyuynge Ane so sayled or euer we stynte. Ouer the grete mayne see of lente. On passage procedynge as we wente. Full euyll we faryd this knowe I trouth. For laus tibi domine after me sente. That was oure maryoner and was full loth. To do any fare cost of any of vs both. So of his fare we were full wery But when of alleluya the hyll we dyd se. Thenne loked we vp and waxed mery. Thankynge god that passed we had. The feble fare of laus tibi domine. We londed then and nothynge were sad. Strayte vppon the promysse we made. To the londe of Aprell we dyde vs hy. That was full of shoures and a countrey lusty. Whiche couered therth full plesaunte to se. Bothe north and south with coloure grene. Thenne goodes encreasyth abundauntly. Unto mankynde but what as therin. I muste good manners to me this tyme myne. For nowe I am completed syxty. Bellicosus and bolde if grete nede be. Howe batayle was maynteyned bytwene Sol Iusticie and Pluto duke of tenebris. Ca. xxiij. Yet right sodeynly there stode we. In maner dysmayde in grete dystresse. For pluto we sawe come rydynge hastely. That duke is namyd of tenebris. Saynge that we sholde be subiectis. And also trybutours vnto hym Whiche to do we bothe refuseden. Thenne sol Iusticie all in good tyme. By vs stode and armyd was redy. Confortynge vs for to defye hym. And by his malyce let not a peny But arme vs both he had hastely. With oure garmentes of fayth and hope And downe with theym at the firste stroke. Nowe dyspleyed is and set a lofte. The bener of the prynce of pease. Thenne came one with noyse vnsoste That naturally was callyd vyce. Sonne to the duke of tenebris. And with hym came moche raskall That thought sure to conquere all. But Sol iusticie dyde both vs call And sayde though parte of oure pylgrymes were Ageynst vs yet doubte not we shall On oure enmyes forsely to werre. For as I knowe in no wyse sure. Is theyr harnes wherfore gladly. Ioyntly togyther kepe we company. Howe vyce toke the forwarde on his parte/&amp; howe Sol iusticie fled. Ca. xxiiij. So vyce the forwarde in contynently. Toke vpon hym with many mo. In harnes armyd full rustely. And pychyd the felde then on a rowe. The capteynes stode the trumpett? gan blowe. Pypynge vp the game to begyn. Uices horse was trapped with synne. Thenne Sol iusticie entered in. Shortly the felde armyd full bryght. And is his shelde bare of grene. A crosse of tymber greyne in syght. With .iij. nayles tryangle by right. The felde apperynge blode rede. Thus entered our capteyne on mercy his stede. We hym folowynge a full good spede. Shortly anone the skrymysshe beganne. And so sure for matter in dede. Uyce with his felysshyp faste layed on. That voce mea was agast soone Thenne oure capteyne Sol iusticie. With In manus tuas away dyd flye. In to a darke vale that was nygh by. But yet at the desyre and specyall request. Of a gracyouse man callyd d?e exaudi. He came agayne and shortly in haste. To ayde vs there came one hyeng taste Whiche is callyd with all and some. Benedictus qui venit ad prelium. Howe Sol iusticie turnyd agayne and dyscumfyte vyce and wan the felde Ca. xxv. Thenne shortly by force we set on. And whan vyce sawe vs come so fersely. He and his company soone away ron. As faste as euer they myght flye. Thus wan the felde sol Iusticie. So exultabo made a crye. That all men sholde shortly drawe nye. Under the baner of the prynce truely. Amyttyd of pease wherby all and some. Myght be knowen and perceyuyd Iustly Seruauntes to the kynge heuyns sonne. After that was fynysshed and done. We were of myndes euyn right bolde.

Oure waye kepe and passe on boldely Admyttynge vs a chaumpion goodly Whose name was callyd amonge vs. Laudate d?m quoniam bonus. A myghty chaumpion and a gloriouse. So with hym we went as victoryouse men Thorowe the londe moste fresshest of floures. That callyd is Lauda Ierusalem. And the londe of behest in a nother Realme Where most hath rule of may the mayre monstryouse The pease maynteyne that by barayle gloryouse. Sol iusticie by power victoryouse. Conquered had thus past we on oure way. Thenne Laudate d?m de celis. Wente forth with vs on our Iourney. Delytynge in conceytes we passed the way. Tyll come we dyd to the ryuer of rogacion. And there for the fery bote we callyd soone. So ouer that ryuer we passed anone. And came a londe euyn right shortly. At the royall cytye of the assenssyon. Where worthely we sawe Sol iusticie. Strayte vp assendynge vnto the sky. Towarde the hy stelyferall regyon. Thenne came two men apparayled right soone In garment? full whyte and to vs come. Byddynge vs both of good chere to be.
