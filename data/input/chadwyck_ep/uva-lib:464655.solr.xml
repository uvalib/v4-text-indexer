Now we shuld syng &amp; say newell, Quia missus est angelus Gabriell. 1 From hevyn was sent an angell of light Vnto a cyte that Nazareth hyght, Vnto a mayd, a bryde so bryght, And full of blis; Nomen Maria virginis. 2 The angell went furth, &amp; nowght he sest; Be-fore that mayden he hym sone drest; He said: “All hayle, thou art full blest And gracius! Quia tecum est Dominus.” 3 Whan Mary this hard, a-stoned was she, And thowght what thys gretyng myght be; The angell her shewed of grace plente, And gret solas, Et dixit: “Maria, ne timeas.” 4 The angell sayd: “Thou maydyn myld, Thou shalt conceyve &amp; bere a chyld, Thy maydynhed shall neuer be defyled, Call hym Jhesus: Hic erat altissimi filius.” 5 Whan Mary, as bryght as crystall ston, Thes wordis hard, answered anon, And asked, how all this myght be done, And sayd: “How so? Quia virum non cognosco.” 6 The angell said: “Thou maydyn still, The Holy Gost shall the fulfill.” The mayd answered with woyse so shryll, And sayd mekely: “Ecce ancilla domini!” 7 Sone after this, this chyld was borne In Bedleme in a wynters morne. Now make we mery hym beforne, &amp; syng newell, Quia missus est angelus Gabriell. 9. Nova, nova: Aue fitt ex Eva. 1 Gabriell of hygh degre, He cam down from the trynyte, From Nazareth to Galalye. vt nova. 2 He mete a maydyn in a place; He kneled down be fore her face; He sayd: “Hayle, Mary, full of grace!” vt nova. 3 When the maydyn sawe all this, She was sore abashed, ywys, Lest that she had done a-mys. vt nova. 4 Then sayd the angell: “Dred not you, Ye shall conceyve in all vertu A chyld, whose name shall be Jhesu.” vt nova. 5 Then sayd the mayd: “How may this be, Godis son to be born of me? I know not of manys carnalite.” vt nova. 6 Then said the angell a-non ryght: “The Holy Gost ys on the plyght, Þer ys no thyng vnpossible to God Almyght.” vt nova. 7 Then sayd the angell a-non: “Ytt ys not fully VI moneth a-gon, Syth seynt Elizabeth conceyved seynt John.” vt nova. 8 Then said the mayd a-non a-hye: “I am Godis own truly, Ecce ancilla domini.” [vt nova.] Explicit. 11.

Explicit. 12. Off a rose, a louely rose, And of a rose I syng a song. 1 Herkyn to me, both old &amp; yonge, How a rose began to sprynge, A fayerer rose to my lykyng Sprong þer neuer in kyngis lond. 2 VI branches ar on þat rose beme, They be both bryght &amp; shene, The rose ys called Mary, hevyn quene, Of her bosum a blossum sprong. 3 The fyrst branch was of gret myght, That spronge on Crystmas nyght, The streme shon over Bedlem bryght, Þat men myght se both brod &amp; longe. 4 The II?? branch was of gret honowr, Þat was sent from hevyn towr, Blessyd be þat fayer flowr! Breke it shall the fendis bondis. 5 The thyrd branch wyde spred Ther Mary lay in her bede, The bryght strem III kyngis lede To Bedlem, þer þat branch þei fond. 6 The IIII?? branch sprong in to hell, The fendis bost for to fell, Ther myght no sowle þer in dwell, Blessid be þat tyme þat branch gan spryng. 7 The V?? branch was fayer in fote, Þat sprong to hevyn tope &amp; rote, Þer to dwell &amp; be owr bote &amp; yet ys sene in priestis hondis. 8 The VI?? branch by &amp; by, Yt ys the V joyes of myld Mary. Now Cryst saue all this cumpany, &amp; send vs gud lyff &amp; long. Explicit. 13.

Now syng we wyth joy and blys: Puer natus est nobis. 1 Mary, flowr of flowers all, Hath born a chyld in an ox stall, That lorde &amp; prynce ys ouer vs all: Puer natus est nobis. 2 He was born on owre Lady With owt weme of her body, Godys own son truly, Puer natus est nobis. 3 By an apull of a tre Bownd men all made were we, That child was born to make vs fre; Puer natus est nobis. 4 That chyld was don on the rode Wyth hys flesshe &amp; with hys blod, For owr helpe &amp; for owr gud; Puer natus est nobis. 5 The III?? day he rose &amp; to hevyn went, Wytt &amp; wysedom he vs sent, For to kepe his cumaundment; Puer natus est nobis. 6 He shall cum down at domys day With blody wovndis, I you say, As he dyed on Gud Fryday; Puer natus est nobis. 7 Now pray we to that hevyn kyng To send vs all his dere blessyng, Shryft &amp; hosyll at owr endyng: Puer natus est nobis. Explicit. 15. Mary moder, I you pray To be owr help at domys day. 1 Att domys day, whan we shall ryse And cum be fore the hygh Justyce And geve a cownt for owr seruyce, What helpyth than owr clothyng gay? 2 Whan we shall cum be fore hys dome, What will vs helpe? ther all &amp; some We shall stond as sory grome Yclad in a full pore a-ray. 3 That ylke day withowt lesyng Many a man hys hondis shall wryng, And repent hym sore for hys lywyng; Then yt ys to late, as I yow say. 4 Ther-for I rede both day &amp; nyght, Make ye redy to God Almyght, For in thys londe ys kyng nor knyght That wott whan he shall wend a-way. 5 That chyld, that was born on Mary, He glad all thys cumpany, And for hys loue make we mery, Þat for vs dyed on Gud Fryday.
