      <field name="fulltext">TO ALL LOVERS OF SAINT FRANCIS, AND ESPECIALLY TO MY FRIEND LOUIS N. PARKER, TO WHOM I OWE THE FIRST SUGGESTION OF THIS EXPERIMENT IN VERSE. AT PERUGIA The young moon mounts; day fades from off the plain; No colour of man's naming hath this sky. Thrilled with the Beatific Vision nigh, So passes a pure spirit without pain. Like billows of a never-breaking main, The Umbrian Apennines hang poised on high, Snow-crested: yonder doth Assisi lie, Lov'd shrine, whereof the whole world's heart is fain. So there from hill to hill was wont to wend, And heal, and teach, and touch with living fire, Francis, God's Saint, six hundred years ago! And thou and I have six poor days to spend, Tread back the past, and to yon heights aspireâ Move slow, dear earth, about the sun, move slow! AT ASSISI I Not thus should he be sepulchred, not thusâ Almsman of God, and spouse of Povertyâ Where fane crowns fane, a pillared praise on high, By Masters of renown made glorious. So men of old revered him: but to us Strange and unmeet it seems that he should lie Where day by day with travel-jaded eye Crowds turn to gaze, and critic-tongues discuss. For pomp and splendour irked him: a bare shrine Rude and rock-beddedâthe blue dome aboveâ Sufficed his soul for worship: he did love To talk with birds and flowers, nor seldom trod Far from man's haunt the cloud-cowled Apennine, To be alone with Godâalone with God. II To stoop in self-abasement to the earth, Not to need happiness, to shun no pain, In weakness to find strength, in losses gain, All things in nothingness, and wealth in dearth, Yea, and by daily death win spirit-birthâ The Vision of the Unseen to sight made plainâ Saint of Assisi, though men doubt thee sane, This was thy wisdom, this thy glorious worth. O Lowliness of Soul, whose inward sway Is Peace and Resignation, with the slow Sure backward-ebbing of the waves of woe, Henceforth and from this hour do thou, we pray, Sit at the heart's helm, pilot us our way, As from the known to the unknown we go! I.HOW SAINT FRANCIS CONVERTED BERNARD OF ASSISI Of Francis, glorious Saint, consider first How that in all his life-deeds he was made Conformable to Christ: for even as Christ Did at the outset of His ministry Choose twelve Apostles to spurn worldly things Each one, and follow Him in poverty And other virtues, so Saint Francis, first Founding his Order, chose companions twelve, Men dowered with deepest poverty. And as One of Christ's twelve Apostles, being of God Found reprobate, at last did hang himself, So of Saint Francis' twelve companions one, Who Brother John o' the Chapel had to name, Turn'd recreant, hanged himself at last. And this To God's Elect a great ensample is And matter for humility and fear, Considering this, that no man in God's grace Is certain to persÃ©ver to the end. And as the holy Apostles wonders were To all the world for sanctity, and filled With the Holy Spirit, even so were those Most holy followers of Saint Francis men Of such deep sanctity, that from the time Of the Apostles until now, the world Ne'er held so marvellous and saintly men: Seeing that one of them was rapt aloft To the third heaven, as was Saint Paul, and this Was Brother Giles; and one of themâthe same Being Brother Philip Lungoâon his lips Was by an Angel touched with coal of fire, As was the Prophet Isaiah: one of them, To wit Brother Silvester, spake with God, Like unto Moses, as friend speaks with friend: And one by subtlety of intellect E'en to the light of divine wisdom soared, As did that eagle, John Evangelist; And this was Brother Bernard, of all hearts Most humble, who to its profoundest depth Laid bare the Holy Scripture: one of them Was made a Saint by God, and canonised In heaven, yet living in the world; and he Was of Assisi, born of gentle blood, Brother Ruffino: and thus each and all Were with peculiar sanctity endowed, As by the sequel is made manifest. Of the companions of Saint Francis first Was Brother Bernard of Assisi, who On this wise gat conversion. While as yet Saint Francis was in laic garb, albeit, The world e'en now despised, he went about The butt of all men's scorn, and in such sort By penance mortified, that he was deemed A fool by many, and mocked at as one mad, And driven away with stones and foul despite Of kinfolk and of aliens, and when he Bore him amid all injury and contempt Patient the while, as he were deaf and dumb, Then Bernard of Assisi, being amongst The noblest of the city, and wealthiest, And wisest, of his wisdom began note This in Saint Francis so exceeding scorn O' the world, and so great patience under wrong, That now, albeit two years by every man Detested and despised, he every seemed More steadfast-patientâ'gan, I say, to think And commune with himself: âIt cannot be But that this Francis hath great grace of God:â And so he bade him sup with him and lodge That night: whereto agreeing, Saint Francis supped And lodged with him. And Bernard thereupon Resolved in heart to watch his sanctity, And thereto caused prepare for him a bed In his own chamber, where by night a lamp Burned ever. And Saint Francis, to conceal His sanctity, so soon as he was come Within the chamber, threw him on the bed, And made a show of sleeping: and likewise Bernard lay down, and in a little while 'Gan loudly snore, as if he slept full fast. Whereat Saint Francis, deeming that indeed Bernard now slept, in the first hush of night Rose up from off his bed, and fell to prayer, And, raising eyes and hands aloft to heaven, With deepest fervour and devotion cried: âMy God, my God!â continuing in these words Instant, with bitter tears, till dawn of day, Ever, and naught beside, âMy God, my God!â Repeating: and these words Saint Francis spake, Thinking with wonder of the excellence Of Majesty Divine, which deigned look down From heaven upon a dying world, and through Francis, His little poor one, purposÃ¨d For his own soul and others to provide A healing of salvation. Therefore now Illumed by spirit of prophecy to foresee The mighty things which God would bring to pass Through him, and through his Order, and withal Musing of his own insufficiency And little worth, he cried to God in prayer That of His goodness and omnipotence, Without which human frailty nothing can, He would aid, supplement, accomplish that Which of itself availed not. Bernard then These gestures of Saint Francis, so devout, By the lamp's light beholding, and himself Devoutly musing on the words he spake, Was by the Holy Spirit touched, inspired, To change his life: wherefore, when dawn appeared, He called Saint Francis, and bespake him thus: âO Brother Francis, I within my heart Am wholly purposed to forego the world, And follow thee in all that thou shalt bid.â Saint Francis, hearing it, grew glad of soul, And said: âThou speak'st, O Bernard, of a thing So great and hard to compass, one would fain Seek counsel first of our Lord Jesu Christ, Beseeching Him make plain His will herein, And teach us how perform it. Let us then Both to the Bishop's, where is a good priest, And bid say Mass, and afterward in prayer Continue until Tierce, entreating God That He, through opening of the Missal thrice, May point the path which He would have us choose.â And Bernard answered that it liked him well. So they at once set forward, and anon Came to the Bishop's: and when now, Mass heard, They had in prayer been instant, until Tierce, The priest, at bidding of Saint Francis, took, Missal in hand, and thereto having made The sign o' the Cross, anon did open it Thrice, in the name of Jesu Christ our Lord. At the first opening was revealed that word, Christ to the young man in the gospel spake, Who to perfection asked Him of the way: âWoulds't thou be perfect, go sell that thou hast, And give unto the poor, and follow Me.â At second opening was that word revealed, Christ spake to His Apostles, when to preach He sent them forth: âTake nothing for the way, Staff, scrip, nor shoes, nor money,â willing so To learn them that for bodily life they must In God hope wholly, have for their whole aim To preach the blessÃ¨d gospel. At the third Opening of missal was that word revealed Christ spake: âIf any will come after Me, Let him deny himself, take up his cross, And follow Me.â Whereat Saint Francis said To Bernard: âLo! the counsel given to us Of Christ! go then, and to the uttermost Perform the thing which thou hast heard; and blest Be our Lord Jesu Christ, who hath herein Vouchsafed to shew us of His gospel-way.â And Bernard, hearing this, went forth and sold All that he hadâand he was very richâ And with great joy his goods distributed To poor men, widows, orphans, monasteries, Pilgrims, and hospitals; in all which things Saint Francis prudently and faithfully Did aid him. And a certain man by name Silvester, seeing Saint Francis to the poor Such sums of money give, or cause to give, Straitened with avarice to Saint Francis said: âThou hast not fully paid me for those stones Which, to repair the church, thou bought'st of me: Now therefore that thou hast the money, pay.â Then marvelling at his greed, and wishing not To strive with him, Saint Francis, as a true Servant of holy gospel, thrust his hands In Bernard's bosom, and with money filled, And in Silvester's bosom placed it, saying If more he wished for, he would give him more: Wherewith content, Silvester turned away, And to his house betook him: and at eve Thinking of that day's work, and self-accused For his own avarice, as of Bernard's zeal He pondered, and Saint Francis' sanctity, The following night, and other twain beside, He had from God a vision, and it was this: That from Saint Francis' mouth a cross of gold Issued, whose summit touched the sky, whose arms Stretched even from the East unto the West. Moved by which vision, for the love of God He gave away his substance, and became A Minor Brother, and of such sanctity And grace in the Order, that he spake with God, As one friend with another; the which oft proved Saint Francis, as hereafter shall appear. And Bernard likewise had of God such grace, That to God's presence he was oft-times rapt In contemplation; who, Saint Francis said, Was worthy of all reverence, and had been The founder of his Order; seeing that he Had first foregone the world, reserving naught, But giving all unto the poor of Christ, And entered on the gospel-poverty, Presenting himself naked to the arms O' the Crucified; whose name be blest by us For ever and for evermore. Amen. II.HOW SAINT FRANCIS WENT TO SPEAK WITH BROTHER BERNARD The most devout thrall of the Crucified, Saint Francis, had through penances severe, And ceaseless weeping, become well nigh blind, And saw but little. Amongst other times Once it befel that he from where he lodged Set forth, and journeyed to a certain place Where Brother Bernard was, to talk with him Of things divine. And, coming to the place, He found he was at prayer within the wood, Wholly uplifted and joined fast to God. Thereat Saint Francis went into the wood And called him: âCome and speak to this blind man.â And Brother Bernard answered him no word, For being a man of contemplation deep, His mind was rapt from earth to God in heaven. And since he had rare grace to speak of God, As erst Saint Francis many a time had proved, He longed the more to talk with him. Anon, After some little space, a second time He called him, and a third, the self-same way; And neither time did Brother Bernard hear, And therefore answered not, nor came to him: Whereat Saint Francis, half disconsolate, Marvelled and left him, chafing inwardly That Brother Bernard, though he called him thrice, Had come not: and, departing with this thought, Saint Francis, now some little way withdrawn, To his companion said: âAwait me here,â And gat him to a lonely place hard by, And fell to prayer, beseeching God reveal Why Brother Bernard had not answered him. And, as he prayed, there came a voice from God, Which spake on this wise: âO poor little man, Why art thou troubled? Should a mortal leave God for the creature? Lo! fast-joined to Me Was Brother Bernard, when thou called'st him, And could not therefore come, nor answer thee: Then marvel not he could not answer, seeing He was so far transported from himself, That of those words of thine he heard not one.â Saint Francis, having this reply from God, To Brother Bernard with all haste returned, In lowly self-arraignment to confess The thought he had toward him: whom so soon As he saw coming, Brother Bernard went To meet him, and fell prostrate at his feet: Whereat Saint Francis, bidding him arise, Told him full meekly of the thought he had, And fret of heart to-him-ward, and how God Had answered him therein; and ended thus: âBy holy obedience I command thee do What I shall bid thee.â Brother Bernard then Fearing Saint Francis, as was oft his wont, Some act extravagant should impose on him, Would fain, so might he without fault, have shunned The said obedienceâtherefore answered thus: âI thine obedience am content to do, So thou wilt promise to do mine.â And when Saint Francis promised, Brother Bernard said: âWhat is it, Father, thou would'st have me do?â Then spake Saint Francis: âI require of thee By holy obedience, as the punishment Of this my pride and arrogance of heart, When I have cast me backward on the ground, Plant one foot on my neck, one on my mouth, And thus from side to side pass over me Three times, with words of contumely and scorn, Saying in chief: âLie there, thou base-born son Of Peter Bernardone! Whence to thee Cometh such insolence that art so vile A creature?ââ Brother Bernard hearing this, Albeit full loth to do him that despite, Yet for the sake of holy obedience, With what best courtesy he could, fulfilled The charge Saint Francis gave him: and, this done, âNow,â quoth Saint Francis, âlay on me the task Which thou requirest of me, seeing that I Have promised to obey thee.â Whereupon Quoth Brother Bernard: âI require of thee By holy obedience, whensoe'er we meet, Thou chide and rate me harshly for my faults.â At the which word Saint Francis marvelled sore, For such was Brother Bernard's sanctity, That him in utmost reverence he held, Nor worthy deemed of blame in anything. Wherefore it came to pass, from that time forth, Saint Francis for the said obedience' sake Shunned to be much with him, that word of blame Might ne'er by him be spoken against one He knew to be of such high saintliness. But when he wished to see him, or to hear Discourse of God, he with what speed he might Would leave him and be gone. It was a thing Right worshipful to witness with what love, Meekness, and reverence, both of word and deed, Saint Francis, holy Father, did entreat His first-born, Brother Bernard. To the laud And glory of Christ Jesu, and withal Of Francis, His poor little one. Amen. III.HOW BROTHER ELIAS WAS QUESTIONED BY AN ANGEL AND ANSWERED PROUDLY In the beginning, and at the Order's birth, When were few Brothers, and as yet they had No settled habitations, it befel That once Saint Francis, on devotion bent, Bound for Galicia and Saint James's shrine, Took with him certain Brothers, of whom one Was Brother Bernard. And, as thus they fared Along the road together, so it was That, coming to a certain place, he found A poor sick man, for whom with pity moved, He said to Brother Bernard: âSon, I will That here thou tarry, this sick man to tend.â And Brother Bernard, meekly kneeling, bowed His head, and from the holy Father's lips Received the said Obedience, and there stayed: And with the rest Saint Francis journeyed on Toward Saint James's. And, arriving there, As night-long in the church Saint Francis prayed, It was of God revealed to him that he Of many a place throughout the world must win Possession, seeing his Order was to spread And swell into a mighty multitude Of Brethren: by which revelation led, Saint Francis straightway 'gan possession win Of places in those regions, and at length, By the same way returning whence he came, Found Brother Bernard there, and the sick man, With whom he had left him, perfectly made whole. Wherefore Saint Francis did permission give To Brother Bernard the next year to go Unto Saint James's. And, with that, returned Saint Francis to Spoleto's vale, and there In a lone place he sojourned, and with him Brother Masseo, Brother Elias too, And certain others, the which one and all Gave right good heed to hinder not, nor let, Saint Francis from his praying: and this they did For the great reverence which they bore to him, And knowing that God would oft, the while he prayed, Shew him of mighty matters. And one day, Saint Francis being at prayer within the wood, Behold! a fair youth, as for travel dight, Came to the House-door, and so hotly knocked, And long, and loudly, that the Brethren all At such unwonted knocking were amazed. Went Brother Masseo and undid the door, And to the youth said: âWhence art thou, my son? Methinks that never wert thou here till now, To knock so strangely.â And the youth replied: âHow should one knock then?â Brother Masseo said: âKnock thrice, with pauses between knock and knock, Then tarry till the Brother shall have time, A Paternoster said, to come to thee: And, if by then he come not, knock once more.â And the youth answered: âIn sore haste am I, And therefore knock so loudly, being bound On a long journey: and I hither came To speak with Brother Francis, but he stays Within the wood, in contemplation wrapt, And I were loth molest him. But go tell Brother Elias I would put to him A question, for I hear he is full wise.â So Brother Masseo did the message bear That Brother Elias to that youth should go; But go he would not, being wroth thereat. Then Brother Masseo wist not what to do, Nor how to answer him: since, if he said That Brother Elias could not come, he lied; If, that for wrath he would not, he feared set An ill ensample. And, as now so long Brother Masseo lingered his return, The youth once more 'gan knocking, as at first: And Brother Masseo to the door returned After a little stay, and said to him: âThou hast not in thy knocking heeded that I taught thee.â And the youth thereto replied: âBrother Elias will not come to me: Go then, tell Brother Francis that I came To speak with him, but seeing that I were loth Break in upon his prayer, bid him instead Send Brother Elias to me.â Thereupon Went Brother Masseo to Saint Francis, who Was praying in the wood with face upturned To heaven, and told him the youth's errand, all, And Brother Elias' answer. Now that youth God's Angel was in human form. Thereat Saint Francis, neither moving from his place, Nor letting droop his countenance the while, Replied to Brother Masseo: âHie thee back, Bid Brother Elias, for Obedience' sake, Go to that youth and tarry not.â And when He heard Saint Francis' bidding, to the door Strode Brother Elias, mightily incensed, And, with great force and bluster opening it, Said to the youth: âWhat wilt thou?â He replied: âBrother, take heed thou be not stirred to wrath, As now thou seemest, seeing that anger snares The soul, nor suffers it discern the truth.â Said Brother Elias: âTell me what thou would'st With me.â Replied the youth: âI ask of thee If it be lawful for the followers Of Holy Gospel of such things to eat As shall be set before them, even as Christ Bade His Disciples: and I further ask If any man have right to lay on them Aught that impugns the gospel liberty.â And Brother Elias haughtily replied: âThis I know well, but will not answer thee: Get thee about thy business!â Said the youth: âI should know better how to answer this, Than thou.â Then Brother Elias waxed full wroth, And shut the door with fury, and was gone. Anon of the said question he began To ponder, and have doubts within himself, And knew not how to solve it; seeing that he, As Vicar of the order, had laid down And stablished as an ordinanceâthereby Out-gospelling the gospel, and the Rule Out-ruling of Saint Francisâthat within The Order should no Brother taste of flesh; So that that question was full-aimed at him. Wherefore, not knowing how to clear himself, And weighing the youth's modesty, and how He said he could a better answer give Than that himself had given, back to the door He turned, and opened it, to ask the youth Of the aforesaid question: but behold! He was already gone, because the pride Of Brother Elias all unworthy was To parley with the Angel. And, this done, Saint Francis, to whom everything had been Revealed of God, from out the wood returned, And loudly with uplifted voice rebuked Brother Elias, saying: âThou dost ill, Proud Brother Elias, to drive hence from us The holy Angels, who come hitherward For our admonishment. I say to thee That I fear greatly lest that pride of thine Should from this Order oust thee at the last.â And, as Saint Francis thus foretold to him, So it befel thereafter, for he died Outside the Order. On the selfsame day, And at that hour whenas the Angel thence Departed, in like semblance he appeared To Brother Bernard from Saint James's shrine Returning, and now standing on the brink Of a great river, and saluted him In his own tongue, and said: âGod give thee peace, Good Brother!â And Brother Bernard marvelling, And musing on the beauty of the youth, And his own native accent, and withal The peaceful greeting, and glad countenance, Inquired of him: âGood youth, whence comest thou?â The Angel answered: âFrom yon place I come Wherein Saint Francis sojourns; and I went To speak with him, and could not, seeing that he Was musing in the wood on things divine, And I would not molest him. In that place Dwells Brother Masseo too, and Brother Giles, And Brother Elias: yea, and I was taught Of Brother Masseo at the door to knock, As do the Brothers: but to my questioning Would Brother Elias yield me no reply: Whereof thereafter he repented him, And would have seen and hearkened unto me, But could not.â After this, the Angel said To Brother Bernard: âWherefore dost thou not Cross over?â Brother Bernard answered him: âBecause I fear the danger, for the depth Of water that I see.â The Angel said: âCross we together, and have thou no doubt!â Therewith he took his hand, and planted him, Even in an eye-wink, on the further side. Then Brother Bernard knew it was indeed God's Angel, and in reverence and deep joy Cried with uplifted voice: âO blessÃ¨d One, Angel of God, make known to me thy name!â The Angel answered: âWherefore askest thou My name, the which is Wonderful?â And when He had so said, the Angel disappeared, Leaving him greatly solaced, in so much That all that road he travelled with good cheer, Still musing of the day and hour, wherein The Angel had appeared to him. And so Arriving where Saint Francis at that time With his companions, as aforesaid, dwelt, He told them, all in order, everything: Then knew they surely that to them and him The selfsame Angel had that day and hour Appeared: and they gave thanks to God. Amen. IV.HOW BROTHER BERNARD WAS SENT TO BOLOGNA Seeing that Saint Francis and his fellowship Were called of God and chosen in heart and deed To bear the Cross of Christ, and preach the same, So both in outward garb and austere life, So in the deeds and labours of their hands, They seemed to be, and were, men crucified: And therefore would they rather suffer shame And insult for Christ's love, than of the world Win reverence, or men's worship and renown. Nay, wrongs rejoiced them, honours made them sad; So, wending through the world as pilgrim-folk And strangers, they bare naught about with them, Saving Christ crucified: and seeing they were True branches of the true Vine, which is Christ, Great fruit of souls and goodly brought they forth, The which for God they won. It came to pass That Brother Bernard, when the Rule began, Was by Saint Francis to Bologna sent, That there, according to the grace vouchsafed Of God to him, he might bear fruit to God: Whereat for holy obedience he set forth, Making the sign of the most holy Cross, And to Bologna came. And, seeing him clad In vile and uncouth garb, the children there Did him foul scorn and manifold despite, As though he were a fool: and patiently Would Brother Bernard, and with cheerfulness, Bear every torment for the love of Christ: Nay, that he might be mocked of them the more, He of set purpose to the city-square Betook him, so that many, as there he sat, Flocking about him, boys alike and men, Some from behind, and others from before, Plucked at his hood; and some threw dust at him, Some stones, some pushed him this way, and some that. But Brother Bernard, ever of one mien, And patient ever, with joyful countenance, Nor chafed thereat, nor changed; and many a day Thither returned he, the like things to bear. And seeing that patience is perfection's work, And warranty of virtue, a wise man And learnÃ¨d of the lawâwhen he beheld And marked such virtue and such constancy In Brother Bernard, as that all those days Nor insult, nor despite, could anger himâ Said to his own heart: âVerily this needs Must be a holy man!â And, coming up, He asked: âWho art thou, and what brings thee here?â And Brother Bernard, for reply thereto, Thrust hand in bosom, and plucking forth the Rule Writ by Saint Francis, gave it him to read: Who, having read it, and considered well The high perfection of its excellence, In utmost wonder and amazement turned And said to his companions: âOf a truth, This of religion is the loftiest state That e'er I heard of: therefore too this man And his companions are, of all this world, The holiest: and, who wrongs him, sorely sins: Whom rather in high honour should we hold, Seeing that he is a true friend of God.â To Brother Bernard turned he then, and said: âWould ye possess you of a House, wherein To serve God fitly, this with right good will I for my soul's salvation will bestow.â And Brother Bernard answered him: âGood Sir, Methinks this word into thy heart was breathed By our Lord Jesu Christ: and therefore I Right willingly accept the proffered gift, Unto Christ's honour.â The said lawyer then To his own home with gladness, lovingly, Brought Brother Bernard, and the promised House Gave him, and made all ready, and garnished it At his own charges, and thenceforth became The father and chief champion both of him And his companions. Brother Bernard too Now by his holy walk began to earn Much honour of the people, so that he, Who did but win to touch or look on him, Deemed himself blessÃ¨d: but himself the while, True, meek disciple, as he was, of Christ And of the lowly Francis, grown afraid Lest the world's honour his soul's peace and health Should hinder, on a day departing thence Returned unto Saint Francis, and said thus: âFather, the House is ready to our need Within Bologna's city, and do thou Send Brothers to maintain it and there stay: Since I no more could profit me therein; Nay, for the too much honour done to me, My loss, I fear, was greater than my gain.â Thereat Saint Francis, hearing everything In order, even as God had brought to pass Through Brother Bernard, rendered thanks to Godâ Who now in such wise 'gan to spread afar The little poor ones of the Crossâand then Of his companions to Bologna sent And Lombardy, the which in divers parts Did many Houses of the Order found. To the good Jesu's honour and praise. Amen. V.CONCERNING THE BLESSED DEATH OF BROTHER BERNARD Such sanctity in Brother Bernard was, That him Saint Francis in high reverence held, And many a time would praise him. On a day, Saint Francis being upon devotion bent And praying, it was revealed to him of God That Brother Bernard by divine consent Must many a shrewd assault of demons bear. Whereat Saint Francis, having tender ruth For the said Brother Bernard, whom he loved As his own son, for many a day with tears Made supplication unto God for him, Commending him to Jesu Christ, that He Would grant him victory o'er the Evil One. And, as Saint Francis thus devoutly prayed, One day God answered: âFrancis, fear thou not, For all the assaults, that must encountered be By Brother Bernard, are of God allowed, To prove his virtue, and to crown his worth: And over all his enemies at the last Shall he have victory, seeing that he is one Of the guest-fellows of the realm of God.â At which reply Saint Francis had great joy, And gave God thanks, and from that hour in love And reverence held him ever more and more; Nor only in his life shewed forth the same, But in death also; for, as death drew nigh, Saint Francis, like the holy Patriarch Jacob, enquired of his devoted sons, Who sorrowed round him, and with many tears Wept for the passing of so loved a sire, âWhere is my first-born? Come to me, my son, Come that my soul may bless thee, ere I die.â Thereat spake Brother Bernard privily To Brother Elias, who was at that time The Vicar of the Order: âFather, go, That he may bless thee, to the Saint's right handâ: And Brother Elias to his right hand went: And lo! Saint Francis, who with eyes o'er-wept Had lost his vision, placing his right hand On Brother Elias, answered: âThis is not The head of Brother Bernard, my first-born.â Then Brother Bernard to his left hand went, Whereat Saint Francis, with arms cross-wise held, Placed his right hand on Brother Bernard's head, His left on Brother Elias, and thus spake To Brother Bernard: âO my son, may God, The Father of our Lord Jesu Christ, vouchsafe With all celestial blessings of the soul In Christ to bless thee! even as thou art The first-born in this holy Order, chosen To yield ensample of the Gospel-life, And follow Christ in gospel poverty; Since not alone thou gavest what was thine, And did'st among the poor distribute it Wholly and freely for Christ's love, but eke Within this Order offered'st God thyself, A sacrifice of sweetness. Be thou then Both of our Lord Christ Jesu and of me, Poor little one, His servant, from henceforth With everlasting benediction blest, Going and staying, waking and asleep, Living and dying: whoso blesseth thee Be filled with blessings, as who curseth thee Shall rest not without punishment. Be thou Chief of thy Brethren, and to thy command Let all the Brothers bow: have thou full power To take into this Order whom thou wilt: No Brother have lordship over thee: be free Of thy good pleasure to depart or stay.â After Saint Francis' death the Brethren loved And reverenced Brother Bernard, as indeed An honoured Father: and, when near his end, To him from divers regions of the world Came many Brethren, and amongst them came The holy and angelic Brother Giles; Who, soon as Brother Bernard he beheld, With right good cheer cried: âSursum corda.â Then Gave holy Brother Bernard secret charge That one of the Brothers should for Brother Giles Prepare a place for meditation meet: And it was done. And Brother Bernard, now Being at point to die, bade raise him up, And to the Brethren, who before him stood, Spake upon this wise: âBrothers well-beloved, I will not speak to you in many words: But ye must bear in mind that yours is still The state religious which erewhile was mine; And that which I have now, ye too shall have Hereafter. Further in my soul I find That for a thousand worlds like unto this I would not choose to have served other Lord Than our Lord Jesu Christ. For all faults done I do accuse me and confess the same Unto my Saviour Jesu, and to you: And I beseech you, Brothers mine most dear, Have love for one another.â And these words Ended, with other admonitions good, He laid him back upon the bed, and lo! His face grew radiant with a wondrous joy, So that the Brethren greatly marvelled all: And in that joyfulness, with glory crowned, His saintly spirit from this present life To the blest life of angels past away, Unto the glory and the praise of Christ. VI.HOW SAINT FRANCIS KEPT LENT ON AN ISLAND OF THE LAKE OF PERUGIA The holy Francis, honoured thrall of Christ, Being in certain matters, as it were, Another Christ, vouchsafed unto the world For men's salvation, 'twas the will of God The Father to conform in many acts And fashion him to the similitude Of His dear Son, Christ Jesu; as was seen Both in the venerable fellowship Of twelve companions, and that miracle, The mystery of the blessÃ¨d Stigmata, And in the unbroken fast of holy Lent, The which he kept on this wise. Being once Nigh to Perugia's lake upon the day Of Carnival in a disciple's house Who loved him, and with whom he had lodged the night, Saint Francis was of God inspired to go Unto an island of the aforesaid lake, That Lent to keep: whereat Saint Francis prayed This fond disciple for the love of Christ To bear him over in his little boat To a lake-island wherein no man dwelt, And this to do upon Ash-Wednesday night, That none might note him. He, for the deep love He had toward Saint Francis, readily Performed the thing he asked, and bare him o'er To the said island. And Saint Francis took But two small loaves with him. And when they touched The island, and his friend, at point to part, Was turning home, Saint Francis by his love Prayed him tell no man wherefore he was there, Nor, save on Holy Thursday, come himself To seek him: so the other from his side Was parted, and Saint Francis left alone. And since there was no dwelling whereunto He might betake him, a thick wooded holt He entered, the which many thorns and shrubs Had shaped to semblance of a little hut Or cave, and therein gat himself to prayer And meditation upon heavenly things. And there all Lent remained he, eating not Nor drinking, save of one of those small loaves The half, as witnessed his disciple, when On Holy Thursday he returned to him, And found, of the two loaves, yet whole the one, And halved the other: and the one half ate Saint Francis out of reverence for the fast, As folk believe, of Christ the BlessÃ¨d One, Who fasted forty days and forty nights, Not tasting even of material food: And so with that half-loaf he chased from him The venom of vainglory, and by Christ's Ensample forty days and forty nights Fasted: and in the place, thereafter, where Saint Francis had this wondrous abstinence Enacted, many a miracle did God Work through his merits; for the which thing's sake Folk 'gan to build them houses, and there dwell; And in brief space arose a hamlet large And goodly, and there, too, the Brothers' House, âHouse of the Islandâ hight; and still the men And women of that hamlet hold the place In love and awe, where kept the aforesaid Lent Saint Francis. To the praise of Christ. Amen. VII.OF PATIENCE WHICH IS PERFECT JOY Once, as Saint Francis to Saint Mary's shrine, Named of the Angels, from Perugia went With Brother Leo in the time of Spring, Pinched shrewdly by the exceeding bitter cold, He cried to Brother Leo, who strode before A little, and said to him: âO Brother Leo, Albeit the Brothers Minor in all lands Give great ensamples of life-holiness And godly edifying, do thou write Nathless, and diligently give heed hereto, That therein is not perfect joy.â Anon, The second time, now further on his way, âO Brother Leo,â Saint Francis cried, âalbeit A Minor Brother to blind eyes give sight, Straighten the crookÃ¨d limb, cast devils out, Make the deaf hear, and the lame man to walk, Yea, to the dumb give speech, andâwhich is yet A greater thingârise up the four-days-dead, Write thou that herein is not perfect joy.â And, going a little way, he loudly cried: âAlbeit the Minor Brother knew all tongues, O Brother Leo, and all sciences, Yea, and all scriptures, so that he had skill To prophesy, nor only bring to light Things future, but the secrets of the heart And conscience, write: âNot here is perfect joy.ââ And yet again, a little further on, Saint Francis loudly called to him, and said: âO Brother Leo, little sheep of God, Albeit the Minor Brother speak with tongue Of angels, and the courses of the stars, And hidden virtues of the herbs, should know, And all earth's treasures were revealed to him, And though he understood of birds and fish And of all beasts the virtues, and of men, And trees, and rocks, and roots, and waterâwrite That not herein is perfect joy.â And yet A little further onward, with loud voice Saint Francis cried: âO Brother Leo, albeit The Minor Brother wist so well to preach, That to Christ's faith all heathendom he win, Write thou that herein is not perfect joy.â And, for two miles the fashion of his speech Continuing thus, much marvelling, at length Spake Brother Leo and enquired of him: âFather, I pray thee in the name of God Make known to me wherein is perfect joy.â And thus Saint Francis answered him: âWhen we Shall to Saint Mary of the Angels come, Soaked thus with rain, and frozen with the cold, And mud-bespattered and with hunger spent Knock at the House-door, and the porter comes In wrath, and asks: âWho are ye?â and we say: âTwo of your Brethren we,â and he replies: âNay, but ye say not sooth, two rogues ye are Who go about cozening the world, to rob The poor man of his alms: away with you!â Nor will not open to us, and makes us stand Out in the rain and snow, hungry and cold, Even until night-fall; then, if all these wrongs, And all this cruelty, and these rude rebuffs, We shall in patience without soreness, bear, And murmur not against him, and shall think With charity and meekness that indeed The porter knows us, and was moved by God To our abuse; O Brother Leo, write That herein there is perfect joy. And if We still continue knocking, and he comes forth Outrageous, and with insults and with blows Drives us away, as knaves importunate, Saying: âGo, get ye hence, vile pilferers! Off to the hospital, since here shall be Nor bed, nor bite for ye!â if this we bear With patience, cheerfulness, and love, herein, O Brother Leo, write, is perfect joy. And if, with cold and hunger and the night Sore pressed, yet knock and call we, praying him With loud plaints, for the love of God, to ope And let us in, and he, the more enraged, Shall say: âLo! these be knaves importunate; Now will I pay them that they have deserved,â And with a knotty staff shall issue forth, And hale us by the hood, and fling to earth, And roll us in the snow, and with that staff Belabour, knot by knotâif all these things We shall with patience joyfully endure, Weighing the sufferings of the blessÃ¨d Christ, The which for His love's sake we ought to bearâ Here and herein, O Brother Leo, write Is perfect joy. Now mark the end hereof: Above all things, all graces, Brother Leo, And gifts of the Holy Spirit, the which Christ Vouchsafeth to His friends, is over self To triumph, and for Christ's sake willingly Bear pains, reproaches, injuries, and want; Seeing that in all the other gifts of God Glory we may not, being not ours, but God's: For which cause saith the Apostle: âWhat hast thou Which thou had'st not of God? And, if of Him Thou had'st it, wherefore glory, even as though Thou had'st it of thyself?â But in the cross Of tribulation and of suffering boast We may, since that is ours: and for this cause The Apostle saith: âI have no will to boast, Save in the Cross of Jesu Christ our Lord.ââ To whom be endless honour and renown For ever and for evermore. Amen. VIII.HOW SAINT FRANCIS AND BROTHER LEO SAID MATINS WITHOUT A BREVIARY It chanced, whenas the Order yet was young, Saint Francis lodged within a certain House With Brother Leo, where no book they had To say the Holy Office: and when now The hour of matins came, Saint Francis spake To Brother Leo: âWe lack breviary, Dear Son, wherewith the Matin-song to say: But, that our time in praising God be spent, Lo! I will speak, and thou shalt make reply, As I shall teach thee; and look well that thou Answer not otherwise, nor change the words I teach. âO Brother Francis,â I shall say, âSuch evils hast thou wrought, such heinous sins, While in the world, that thou deservest hellâ: And, Brother Leo, thou shalt make reply: âTrue is it thou hast earned hell's lowest depth.ââ Said Brother Leo, simple as a dove, âWillingly, Father, in God's name begin.â Thereat Saint Francis 'gan to say: âSuch ills, O Brother Francis, in the world thou'st wrought, And sins so many, that thou deservest hell.â âGod,â replied Brother Leo, âthrough thee will work Such weal, that thou shalt go to Paradise.â âNay, Brother Loe, not thus,â Saint Francis said, âArt thou to answer: but when I shall say, âO Brother Francis, against God thou'st wrought Iniquities so many, that thou deserv'st To be accurs'd of God,â say, âVerily Among the accursÃ¨d thou deserv'st to be.ââ And Brother Leo made answer, âWillingly, My Father.â Then with many tears, and sighs, And beatings of the breast, with loud voice spake Saint Francis: âO my Lord of heaven and earth, Against Thee I have wrought so many wrongs, And sins so many, I well deserve of Thee To be accurs'd.â And Brother Leo replied: âSo, Brother Francis, shall God deal with thee, That thou among the blessÃ¨d shalt be blest Supremely.â And Saint Francis, marvelling That Brother Leo made answers opposite To that he had enjoined, rebuked him, saying: âWhy, as I teach thee, answerest thou not? By holy obedience, I command that thou Make answer, as I bid thee: I shall say: âO Brother Francis, miserable wight, Thinkest thou God will mercy shew to thee, Seeing so oft thou hast trespassed against Him, Who is the Father of mercies, and, therewith, God of all consolation, that thou art Unworthy to find mercy?â Whereunto Thou, brother Leo, little lamb, shalt say: âMercy to find no whit art worthy thou.ââ But afterward, whenas Saint Francis said: âO Brother Francis, miserable wight,â With the like words that followed, thus to him Made answer Brother Leo: âMy Father, God, Whose mercy than thy sin is vaster far, Will shew thee plenteous mercy, and thereto Add many graces.â Upon which reply Sweetly indignant, patiently distressed, Saint Francis thus to Brother Leo spake: âWhy 'gainst obedience hast thou thus presumed, And now so oft made answers opposite Of that which I enjoined thee?â âNay, God knows, Father,â with reverence and humility Quoth Brother Leo, âthat each time I fixed Within my heart to answer as thou bad'st, But God hath made me speak as pleaseth Him, Not as me pleaseth.â Whereat marvelling, To Brother Leo Saint Francis spake and said: âRight lovingly I pray thee that this time Thou answer as I told thee.â âIn God's name Speak,â replied Brother Leo, âfor verily Will I this time make answer as thou wilt.â Then spake with tears Saint Francis: âDost thou think, O Brother Francis, miserable wight, God will to thee shew mercy?ââand the rest. âYea,â replied Brother Leo, âplenteous grace Shalt thou receive of God, who will exalt And glorify thee even for evermore: For who himself doth humble, he shall be Exalted; and none other can I say, For by my mouth God speaketh.â On this wise In lowly striving, amid many tears, And with much ghostly solace, until dawn They kept their vigil. To the praise of Christ. IX.HOW BROTHER MASSEO MADE PROOF OF SAINT FRANCIS When in the House of Portiuncula Saint Francis once with Brother Masseo lodged Of Marignanoâa right saintly man, Discreet withal, and graced to speak of God, For which thing's sake Saint Francis loved him muchâ One day Saint Francis from the wood and prayer Returning, and e'en now at the wood's mouth, The said Brother Masseo would make proof Of his humility, and to meet him went, And, as in mockery said: âWhy after thee? Why after thee? Why after thee?â Replied Saint Francis: âWhat is that which thou would'st say?â Quoth Brother Masseo: âWhy doth the whole world Run after thee, I say, and all so crave To see, hear, and obey thee? Thou art not Comely of form, thou art not greatly learn'd, Noble thou art not: whence then cometh it That the whole world runs after thee?â This word Saint Francis hearing waxed right glad of soul, And, raising face to heaven, a great while stood With mind in God uplifted, and anon, Come to himself again, knelt down, and gave Glory and thanks to God, and afterward With utmost fervour of spirit turned once more To Brother Masseo, and said to him: âWould'st know Why after me? Why after me would'st know, Would'st know why after me the whole world runs? This have I from the eyes of most high God, The which in every place behold both good And guilty: wherefore those most holy eyes Have among sinners beheld none more vile, More helpless, or more sinful, than am I: So that, to do that wondrous work the which He purposeth to do, He hath not found On earth a viler creature; for which cause Me hath He chosen to tread under foot The nobleness, the greatness, and the strength, The beauty, and the wisdom of the world: So men may know that every grace and good Cometh of Him, not of the creature, yea, And that no flesh may glory in His sight, But, who would glory, glory in the Lord, To whom is glory and honour without end.â Then Brother Masseo, at this meek response, Spoke with such fervour, was afeard, and wist How that Saint Francis stood firm-based on true Humility. To the praise of Christ. Amen. X.HOW SAINT FRANCIS MADE BROTHER MASSEO TO TURN ROUND One day, Saint Francis walking by the way With Brother Masseo, as it chanced, the said Brother Masseo walked some steps before: And coming to a cross-way, from the which One might to Florence, or Siena wend, Or to Arezzo, Brother Masseo said: âFather, by which way must we go?â Replied Saint Francis: âBy the way which God shall will.â Said Brother Masseo: âHow are we to know God's will?â Replied Saint Francis: âBy the sign Which I shall show thee: wherefore I command, As holy obedience doth require of thee, That in the cross-way where thy feet are set Thou turn thee round and round, as children do, Nor stay thy turning till I speak the word. Then Brother Masseo 'gan to turn him round, And turned so often, that through dizziness Of brain, the which such turning wont to breed, He fell to earth full many a time: but since No word of resting did Saint Francis speak, And he would fain obey him faithfully, Each time arose he, and 'gan turn again. At last, while he was bravely turning still, Saint Francis said: âStand fast, and move not:â so He stood: whereat Saint Francis asked of him: âToward what quarter is thy face now set?â And Brother Masseo said: âSiena-ward.â Saint Francis answered: âThat then is the way Which God would have us go.â And as they went Along that way, sore marvelled to himself Brother Masseo, that Saint Francis thus Had made him act as though he were a child, Before the lay-folk who were passing by: Nathless for reverence durst he say no word Unto the holy Father. As they drew Nigh to Siena, lo! the city-folk Of the Saint's coming heard, and gat them out To meet him, and devoutly bare him on, With his companion, to the bishop's house, So that the ground ne'er touched they with their feet. At that time certain of the folk had strife Together, and already twain were dead. And, thither come, Saint Francis preached to them Words so devout and holy, that they all To peace and perfect amity were brought, And concord each with other. For which cause The Bishop of Siena, when he heard What holy deed Saint Francis had performed, Bade to his house, and entertained him there With utmost honour, both that day and night. And the next morn Saint Francis, who in sooth Being right humble sought in all he did Naught but God's glory, gat him up betimes With his companion, and departed thence, Nor knew the bishop aught thereof. Whereat Brother Masseo went along the way With inward murmurs, saying: âWhat is this That this good man hath done? Me like a child He made spin round, and to the bishop, who Such honour paid him, gave he no good word, Nor did with thanks requite him:â and herein To Brother Masseo did Saint Francis seem To have borne him indiscreetly. But anon By heavenly inspiration to himself Once more returning, of himself rebuked, With his own heart he spake: âThou art too proud, Brother Masseo, in that thou dost judge Of things divine; and worthy of hell thou art For this thy witless pride; since yesterday Such holy deeds were by Saint Francis wrought That, had God's angel wrought them, they had been No whit more wondrous: wherefore to throw stones If he had bidden thee, thou should'st have obeyed: For that which on this road was done by him Came of God's ordinance, as plain appears By the good end which afterward ensured: Since if he had not reconciled the folk Who were at strife together, not alone Had many bodies been with daggers slain, Which was afoot already, but many souls Likewise the devil had dragged down to hell Wherefore thou art a most fond man and proud, At that to murmur which, full plain to see, Springs from the will of God.â And all these things, Which Brother Masseo spake with his own heart, Going before him, were of God revealed Unto Saint Francis: wherefore, drawing near, Saint Francis said to him: âHold fast the thoughts Which now thou thinkest, seeing that they are good, And serviceable, and of God inspired: But thy first murmuring was blind, proud, and vain, And by the devil implanted in thy heart.â Then Brother Masseo saw that of a truth Saint Francis knew the secrets of his soul, And wist full surely that in all his acts The Spirit of heavenly wisdom did direct The holy Father. To the praise of Christ. XI.HOW SAINT FRANCIS WISHED TO ABASE BROTHER MASSEO Saint Francis being minded to abase Brother Masseo, that through many gifts And graces, which God gave him, he might not Uplift him to vainglory, but grow up By virtue of humility, therewith, From virtue unto virtue, once, when he Was lodging in a lonely place with those True Saints, his first disciples, among whom Was the said Brother Masseo, on a day, All the companions present, spake and said To Brother Masseo: âThy companions here, O Brother Masseo, one and all have grace For contemplation and for prayer, but thou The grace, by preaching of God's word, to give Their fill unto the people: for which cause, That these on contemplation may be bent, I will thou do the office of the door, Of alms, and of the kitchen; and, withal, When eat the other Brethren, thou shalt eat Outside the House-door, that to those who come, Or ere they knock, thou may'st vouchsafe their fill Of the good words of God; so need there none Go forth, but thou, to greet them; and this do As holy Obedience doth require.â Thereat Brother Masseo drew aback his hood, And bowed his head, and humbly did receive And keep the holy mandate, many days Doing the office of the door, of alms, And of the kitchen. His companions then, As men by God illumined, 'gan to feel Sore prickings at the heart, bethinking them That Brother Masseo was indeed a man Of high perfection, as themselves, or more, Yet all on him, no whit on them, was laid The burden of the House. For which thing's sake Moved all by one desire they gat them forth, And prayed the holy Father to mete out Those offices amongst them, seeing indeed Their consciences could brook not that such toils Be borne by Brother Masseo. Hearing this, Saint Francis to their counsels yielded him, Bowed to their will, and, having called him, said To Brother Masseo: âThy companions here, O Brother Masseo, of the offices I gave thee would partake: I therefore will That the said offices divided be.â Said Brother Masseo with deep humbleness And patience: âFather, that thou layest on me, Or whole, or part, I deem it done by God.â Thereat Saint Francis, when he saw their love, And Brother Masseo's humbleness of heart, Anon discoursed to them in wondrous wise On blest humility, exhorting them How that the greater are the gifts of grace Vouchsafed to us of God, the more should we Be humble, since without humility No virtue is with God acceptable. And, done the preaching, with the tenderest love Forthwith those offices he meted out Among them. To the praise of Christ. Amen. XII.HOW SAINT FRANCIS PRAYED FOR THE GRACE OF POVERTY AND RECEIVED THE SAME The wondrous thrall and follower of Christ, To wit, Saint Francis, that in everything He might to Christ conform him perfectlyâ Who, as the gospel saith, by two and two Sent His disciples forth to every town And place Himself would visitâhaving now By Christ's ensample brought companions twelve Together, sent them forth by two and two, To preach throughout the world. And, that he might Of true obedience an ensample set, He was himself the foremost to go forth, According to Christ's pattern, who began, Or ere He taught, to do. For the which cause, Having assigned the other parts o' the earth To his companions, and accompanied Himself by Brother Masseo, he took road Toward the land of France. And, on a day, Coming nigh famished to a certain town, They went begging their bread, for love of God, As the Rule bade them: and Saint Francis took One street, and Brother Masseo one. But since Saint Francis was a meanly favoured man, And small of stature, and, for this thing's sake, Deemed a vile beggar of him who knew him not, He for his asking gat but paltry bits, And scanty morsels of dry bread: whereas Brother Masseo, seeing that he was tall And of fine presence, unto him were given Enow of goodly portions and of great, And from the unbroken loaf. Now when they had made An end of begging, afterward they met To eat together in a certain place Forth from the town, where was a fountain fair, That had a stone beside it fair and great, Where all the alms they set that each had ta'en In begging. And Saint Francis, when he saw That Brother Masseo's portions of the bread Were more, more fine, and larger than his own, Brake forth in utmost gladness, and exclaimed: âO Brother Masseo, worthy are we not Of such great treasure:â and to him these words Full many a time repeating answer made Brother Masseo: âHow of treasure speak, My Father, where is such deep poverty And lack of all things needful? Here we have Nor cloth, nor knife, nor plate, nor porringer, Nor house, nor board, nor serving-man, nor maid.â Thereto replied Saint Francis: âThis is that I deem great treasure, where is no house prepared By human art, but whatsoe'er is here Hath been prepared by Providence divine, As plain appeareth in this bread we begged, And fair stone table, and pellucid spring. Wherefore I will we pray to God that this So noble treasure of holy poverty, The which hath God for servitor, He may Make us with all our heart to love.â And when These words were spoken, and their repast was done, After prayer made, they rose to wend their way France-ward; and, coming to a certain church, Saint Francis unto his companion said: âLet us withdraw into this church to pray.â And thereupon Saint Francis passed behind The altar, and betook himself to prayer; And such surpassing ardour he received From divine visitation, as he prayed, The which in very truth so fired his soul To love of holy poverty, that now From colour of face, and strangely parted lips, He seemed to be forth-shooting flames of love. And, coming to him thus with fervour fired, He said to his companion: âAh! ah! ah! Brother Masseo, give thyself to me!â And this he said three times; and the third time Saint Francis with his breath upraised in air Brother Masseo, and in front of him Launched, a great spear-length; and amazement vast Seized Brother Masseo. And, as afterward To his companions he recounted it, While by the breath Saint Francis breathed on him Raised and impelled, such sweetness of the soul He felt, and comfort of the Holy Ghost, As all his life-time felt he ne'er the like. This done, Saint Francis said: âComrade most dear, Now hie we to Saint Peter and Saint Paul, And pray them teach and aid us to possess The sumless treasure, poverty divineâ Treasure which so august and godlike is, That in these filthy vessels we are all Unworthy to possess it, seeing that this Is that celestial virtue, whereby things Earthly and transient are trod underfoot, And every trouble lifted from the soul, That all unfettered with Eternal God She may unite her. This that virtue is Which makes the spirit housed on earth to hold High converse with the Angels: this is that Which with Christ sojourned on the Cross, with Christ Was buried, rose again with Christ, with Christ Mounted to heaven; which even in this life Unto the souls that love her doth vouchsafe Ease to soar heavenward, since she guardeth still The arms of true humility and love. Now therefore intercession let us crave Of Christ's most holy Apostles, who themselves Were perfect lovers of this gospel-pearl, Grace to obtain of our Lord Jesu Christ, That He would make us of His sacred ruth Worthy to be true lovers, worshippers, And lowly learners of the thrice beloved And ever precious gospel-poverty. Amid such communing to Rome they came, And passed within Saint Peter's, and thereof Saint Francis in one corner, and in one Brother Masseo gat himself to prayer: And as they bode long time with many tears Praying devoutly, to Saint Francis' sight In glorious sheen the blest Apostles twain, Peter and Paul, appeared, who said to him: âSince thou dost ask and crave to follow that Which followed was of Christ and of the blest Apostles, therefore Jesu Christ the Lord Bids us declare to thee thy prayer is heard, And that to thee and to thy followers In full perfection is vouchsafed of God The treasure of most holy poverty. And, further, we bring word to thee from Him That whosoe'er shall follow this desire By thine ensample perfectly, hath pledge Of bliss in life eternal: and thyself And all thy followers shall be blest of God.â So, having said, they vanished from his sight, Leaving Saint Francis with heart-solace filled. Anon, from prayer uprising, he returned To his companion, and enquired if God Had naught to him revealed: he answered no. Then told Saint Francis how that to himself The holy Apostles had appeared, and what Revealed to him: whereat right joyfully Back to Spoleto's valley they resolved Each to return, their journey into France Foregoing. To the praise of Christ. Amen. XIII.HOW CHRIST APPEARED TO SAINT FRANCIS AND HIS COMPANIONS Saint Francis, when the Order first began, Being with his companions on a time Met in a certain place, to talk of Christ, He, by the ardour of his spirit moved, Bade one of them in God's name ope his mouth, And utter forth of God what words so e'er The Holy Ghost inspired. The Brother then His hest fulfilling, and in wondrous sort Speaking of God, Saint Francis laid on him Silence, and bade another do the like: And he obeying, as in subtlest wise Of God he spake, Saint Francis upon him Laid the like silence, and so bade a third Discourse of God; and in like manner he So deeply of God's hidden mysteries 'Gan to give utterance, that Saint Francis knew He also by the Holy Spirit spake, Even as the other twain: which was withal By special sign made manifest, for as They parleyed thus together, in their midst Appeared the blessÃ¨d Christ, who, in the form Of a fair youth, vouchsafed His benison, And with such sweetness filled them, that they all Were ravished from themselves, and lay as dead, Not heeding aught of this world. Afterward, When to themselves they came, Saint Francis said: âBrethren belovÃ¨d, give ye thanks to God, Who by the mouth of simple folk hath deigned The wealth of heavenly wisdom to reveal: Since God it is that openeth the mouths Of dumb men, and the tongues of simple folk Maketh to utter words surpassing wise. XIV.HOW SAINT CLARE ATE WITH SAINT FRANCIS IN SAINT MARY OF THE ANGELS Saint Francis, at Assisi sojourning, Would visit oft Saint Clare, and unto her Give holy admonitions. Now she had A strong desire for once to eat with him, And to that end besought him many a time, But ne'er that solace would he grant to her. For which cause his companions, when they saw Saint Clare's desire, unto Saint Francis said: âFather, we deem this sternness sorteth not With heavenly charity, that to Sister Clare, A maid so saintly and by God beloved, Thou should'st not hearken in a thing so slight As to eat bread with thee, and that the more, Seeing that through thy preaching she renounced The riches and the splendour of the world. Yea, in good sooth a greater grace than this, An she had asked thee, wert thou bound to do Unto thy spiritual plant.â Thereat Replied Saint Francis: âThink ye that I ought To grant it?â His companions answered him: âYea, Father, meet and right it is that thou Do her this solace.â Then Saint Francis said: âSince so to you, so seems it then to me; And, more to comfort her, I will this feast Be in Saint Mary of the Angels held; Since at Saint Damian's for so long a time She hath been cloistered, that 'twill gladden her To look a little on Saint Mary's House, Where she was shorn, and unto Jesu Christ Espoused: there let us eat then in God's name Together.â And when the appointed day was come, Saint Clare from out her Convent issuing, With one companion, and accompanied By the Companions of Saint Francis came Thus to Saint Mary of the Angels, where, Her salutation to Maid Mary given Before the shrine where she was shorn and veiled, To view the House they led her, till such hour As they should dine. Saint Francis therewithal On the bare ground, the while, let spread the board, As was his wont: and when the hour was come, They set them down, Saint Francis and Saint Clare Together, and, with Saint Clare's companion, one Of the Companions of Saint Francis: then Who yet remained did range them at the board Right humbly. And behold! at the first dish, Saint Francis 'gan so sweetly speak of God In words so wondrous, that, the overflow Of grace divine descending from on high Upon them, one and all were rapt in God: And while they were thus rapt, with eyes and hands Upraised to heaven, those of Assisi's town, Bettona, and the country round about, Beheld Saint Mary of the Angelsâall The House, and the wood near itâburning bright; And there appeared as 'twere a mighty fire, That did the Church, the House, the forest, fill; Whereat the Assisans gat them at great speed Thither to quench it, thinking the whole place Was fiercely blazing. But, arrived the House, And finding there no fire, they entered in, And saw Saint Francis, and Saint Clare, and all Their company, so sitting, rapt in God, In contemplation round that humble board. Whence understood they of a truth that that Had not been earthly, but celestial, fire, Miraculously sent by God to shew And symbolise the fire of love divine, Whereby those holy Brothers, holy Nuns, Were soul-enkindled; and they went their way Much comforted. A long time afterward, Saint Francis, and Saint Clare, and all the rest, Returning to themselves, and feeling sweet Refreshment from that spiritual food, Gave but scant heed unto the body's fare. And so Saint Clare, this blest refection done, Back to Saint Damian with good escort hied; And, seeing her, the Sisters were right glad, For they had feared Saint Francis sending her To rule some other Convent, as ere now Her holy Sister Agnes had been sent To rule in Florence o'er the Sisterhood Of Monticelli; and Saint Francis once Had said to her: âBe ready, if need were I sent thee to some other House:â and she, Of holy Obedience a daughter true, Made answer: âFather, send me where thou wilt, Ready am I to go.â And therefore now Much joyed the Sisters to receive her back; And therewithal Saint Clare from that time forth Remained much solaced. To the praise of Christ. XV.HOW SAINT FRANCIS PREACHED TO THE BIRDS The holy Francis, humble thrall of God, Soon after his conversion having now Assembled, and within the Order brought Many companions, fell to pondering deep, In mighty doubt of that he ought to doâ Or wholly give himself to prayer, or else Sometimes to preaching: and hereof he craved Right earnestly to know God's will. And since The holy humbleness, that in him was, Suffered him not upon himself presume, Or his own prayers, he thought the Will Divine To seek through prayers of others: so he called Brother Masseo, and bespake him thus: âHie thee to Sister Clare, and from my mouth Bid her, with one of her companions Most spiritual, devoutly to pray God That it might please Him manifest to me Whether of these were betterâor to give Myself to preaching, or to prayer alone: Then go to Brother Silvester, and bespeak Him in like manner. He had lived i' the world, And was that Brother Silvester who had seen A gold cross issue from Saint Francis' mouth, Whose height reached heaven, whose breadth to the earth's end. And the said Brother Silvester was of such Deep sanctity of life, that whatsoe'er He asked of God was heard and granted him, And oft he talked with God; for which things' sake Saint Francis held him in heart-worship. So Brother Masseo, as Saint Francis bade, Departed, and performed his embassage First to Saint Clare, and, after, in due course To Brother Silvester, who, receiving it, Forthwith to prayer addressed him, and obtained, Praying, an answer from on high, and turned To Brother Masseo, and on this wise spake: âThus saith the Lord: âTo Brother Francis say, God hath not called him for himself alone To this estate, but that he may bear fruit Of souls, and many may through him be saved.ââ So, to his questing having this response, Brother Masseo to Saint Clare returned, To know what ansser she had gained of God: And she replied she had of God received, With her companion, the self-same response As Brother Silvester. With this message then Brother Masseo to Saint Francis went: And him Saint Francis with most fervent love Greeted, and washed his feet, and made the meal Ready, and, when he had eaten, bade him come Into the wood, and knelt before him there, And drew his hood back, making of his arms A cross, and thus enquired of him: âWhat is it That my Lord Jesu Christ doth bid me do?â And Brother Masseo answered: âEven so To Brother Silvester, as to Sister Clare And to her sister, hath Christ made reply, Revealing it to be His will that thou Should'st through the world go preaching, seeing that He Hath chosen thee not for thyself alone, But for the sake of other souls beside.â This answer then Saint Francis having heard, And knowing therefrom the will of Jesu Christ, Uprose, and with exceeding fervour said: âIn God's name go we!â and therewith he took Brother Masseo and Brother Agnolo, Both holy men, to bear him company. And as, by ardour of the spirit driven, He went, naught recking of the road or path, He came unto a certain village called Carmano, and Saint Francis thereupon Addressed himself to preach; but first he bade The swallows, that were twittering, to be still Till he should end his preaching; and the birds Obeyed him; and so fervently he preached, That all the men and women there were fain To quit the village and go after him. But this Saint Francis suffered not, and said: âBe not o'er-hasty, nor from hence depart; And I will order that ye ought to do For your souls' saving.â And he thereupon Bethought him the third Order to create, Whereby the whole world might salvation win. So solace-filled he left them, and full well To penitence disposed, and, parting thence, Betwixt Carmano and Bevagna came. And, ardently as ever journeying on, He raised his eyes and certain trees beheld Fast by the way-side, on whose boughs were perched A multitude of birds innumerable, So that Saint Francis was amazed thereat, And said to his companions: âIn the road Ye shall await me here, while I go preaeh Unto the birds my sisters: and he went Within the field, and to the birds 'gan preach That on the ground were sitting; and at once Those that were on the trees did come to him, And, one and all, stayed motionless until Saint Francis had done preaching, and e'en then Departed not till he had given them His benediction. And, as afterward Brother Masseo unto Brother James Of Massa told it, though Saint Francis now Walked in their midst, and touched them with his cloak, No bird did budge for him. And this in brief Was what Saint Francis preached to them: âO birds My sisters, much to your Creator God Are ye beholden, and in every place Should alway praise Him, who hath given to you Twofold and threefold raiment, and beside Hath made you free to fly abroad at will, And further did preserve in Noah's ark A seed of you, that so your race i' the world Might minish not: nor less are ye to God Beholden for the element of air By Him bequeathed you: and, beside all this, Ye sow not, neither do ye reap, and God Doth feed you, giving you the springs and streams To drink of, and for refuge hills and vales, And the high trees to make your nests therein: And seeing ye know not how to spin or sew, God clotheth you, and eke your little ones: Right well doth your Creator love you then, Who all these benefits vouchsafeth you. Wherefore, my little sisters, look to it Ye sin not through ingratitude, but strive Ever your utmost to give praise to God.â And, as Saint Francis spake these words to them, Lo! all those birds began to ope their beaks, Stretch out their necks, and spread abroad their wings, Bow reverently their heads to earth, and shew By songs and gestures what great joy the words Of the holy Father gave them: and with them Rejoiced Saint Francis likewise, and was glad; And much amazed him all that multitude And wondrous fair diversity of birds, And how they hearkened, and their friendly ways; For the which cause devoutly did he laud Their Maker in them. Last, the preaching done, Saint Francis o'er them made the sign o' the Cross, And gave them leave to go: then all those birds Did in one flock uplift them into air With marvellous songs, and like unto the cross Saint Francis had made over them, e'en so Divided four-wise, whereof one part flew Eastward, one west, a third toward the south, And the fourth northward; and each several flock Upon its way sang wondrous songs, thereby To symbolise that, as Saint Francis now, The standard-bearer of the Cross of Christ, Had preached to them, and over them had made The sign o' the Crossâaccording to which sign They to the world's four quarters did divideâ So should the preaching of the Cross of Christ, Requickened by Saint Francis, be by him And by the Brethren borne through all the world; Which Brethren, like the birds, possessing naught In this world, to God's Providence alone Commend their being. To Christ's praise. Amen. XVI.HOW A LITTLE LAD SAW SAINT FRANCIS TALKING WITH CHRIST A little lad right pure and innocent, Was, while Saint Francis lived, received within The Order, and abode in a small House, Wherein the Brothers of necessity Slept twain a bed: and on a time it chanced Saint Francis came to the said House at eve, And after Compline gat him to repose, That, while the other Brethren slept, he might Arise, as was his wont, by night to pray. Now the said little lad had set his heart To watch Saint Francis' ways full diligently, His saintliness to learn, and above all Know how he bore him when by night he rose. And, to the end that sleep might cheat him not, The aforesaid little lad lay down to rest Next to Saint Francis, and his own cord tied Unto Saint Francis' cord, that he might feel When he arose: and naught hereof perceived Saint Francis. But at night in his first sleep, When all the Brothers slept, Saint Francis rose From sleep, and, finding his cord fastened thus, Loosed it so softly that the little lad Felt nothing, and alone Saint Francis went Into the wood which bordered on the House, And entered a small cell that was therein, And fell to prayer. After a little time The lad awoke, and, finding the cord loosed, And up and gone Saint Francis, rose himself And went in search of him: and seeing the door Open, which led into the wood, he deemed Saint Francis had gone thither, and himself Entered the wood. And, coming nigh the place Where prayed Saint Francis, he began to hear Much talking, and drew closer for to learn What the sound meant, and saw a marvellous light Which did surround Saint Francis, and therein Christ, and the Virgin Mary, and with them Saint John, both Baptist and Evangelist, And a great multitude of Angels, who Were talking with Saint Francis. And this lad, Seeing and hearing, fell to earth in a swoon: And when the mystic, holy vision closed, Saint Francis, homeward wending, with his feet Happed on the little lad, who lay as dead Upon the path, and, pitying, in his arms Uplifted him, and bare him to his bed, As the good shepherd doth his little sheep. And learning from him after how he had seen That Vision, he forbade him tell the thing Ever to any, while himself should live. And growing in God's grace abundantly, And deep love for Saint Francis, afterward The little lad became a valiant man In the Order, nor until Saint Francis died Aught of that Vision to the Brotherhood Revealed he. To the praise of Christ. Amen. XVII.HOW SAINT FRANCIS HELD A CHAPTER AT ASSISI The holy Francis, faithful thrall of Christ, Once at Saint Mary of the Angels held A Chapter General, at which Chapter met More than five thousand Brothers. Thither came Saint Dominic, Head and Founder of the Rule Of preaching Friars, from Borgogna then Bound Rome-ward. So when to his ears was borne This gathering of the Chapter, at that time Held by Saint Francis in Saint Mary's plain, Named of the Angels, to the sight he hied, With seven of his Order. Furthermore At the said Chapter was a Cardinal, Devoted to Saint Francis, who erewhile Had prophesied to him he should be Pope: And so it came to pass. This Cardinal Had of set purpose from Perugia's town, Where the Court sojourned, to Assisi come: And day by day he gat him down to see Saint Francis and his Brothers, and at times Would chant the Mass, at times discourse to them In Chapter: and deep solace and delight Had the said Cardinal, whene'er he came To view that holy fellowship. And as Upon the plain around Saint Mary's shrine He saw the Brothers set in companiesâ Here forty, here a hundred, and here twice Or thrice that tale together, wholly bent Upon discourse of God, on prayer, on tears, On tasks of charityâand continuing Rapt in such silence, with such modesty, That not a sound was heard thereâmarvelling At all that host so marshalled, he exclaimed With tears and deep devotion: âThis is sure The camp and army of the Knights of God.â And none was heard in all that multitude Prating or jesting, but where met so-e'er A company of Brothers, or they prayed, Or said the Office, or bewailed their sins, Or sins of benefactors, or discoursed Of God, or of the saving of the soul. Now in that camp were roofs of willow-withes, And mats of rushes, ranged in groups, as were The Brothers of the divers Provinces: Wherefore that Chapter also gat to name The Chapter of rush-mats or willow-withes. On the bare earth their beds were, and some had A little straw thereto; of stones or wood Their pillows: for the which things' sake so deep Was the devotion toward them of who heard Or saw, and such their fame for sanctity, That from the Pope's Court, at Perugia then, And other districts of Spoleto's vale, Many to see them came, Counts, Barons, Knights, And others gently born, much country-folk, And Cardinals and Bishops therewithal, Abbots and other Churchmenâto behold This gathering so holy, great, and meek, That the like multitude of saintly men The world ne'er saw together: and in chief Came they the holy Father and the Head Of that most sacred Order to behold, Who such fair booty from the world had won, And so devout and fair a fellowship Assembled, in the steps of Jesu Christ To followâthe true Shepherd. So when now The Chapter General was fully met, Saint Francis, holy Father of them all, And Minister in chief, with soul afire Set forth the Word of God, and preached to them In a loud voice that which the Holy Ghost Moved him to utter: and these words he took For theme of his discourse: âMy little sons, Great things we have promised, but things greater far Are promised us of God, if we but keep That we have promised, and expect in faith His promises to-us-ward. The world's joy Is brief, but endless the ensuing pain: Little the pain of this life, infinite The glory of the other.â Upon these words He, most devoutly preaching, comforted The Brethren all, and to obedience Led them, and reverence for Holy Church, Their Mother, and to fraternal love, and prayer For all men, and in worldly teen to have Patience, and temperance in prosperity; Ever to live as Angels pure and chaste; With God and men and their own hearts to be At peace and concord, and to love withal And cherish holiest Poverty. And here âI charge you all,â quoth he, âas is required By holy obedience, that no one of you, Met thus together, be careful or take thought Whereof to eat or drink, nor yet provide Things needful for the body, but give yourselves To prayer and praise of God alone, and leave Care for your bodies unto Him, since He Hath special care for you.â And with glad heart And joyful countenance received they all This charge, and, when Saint Francis made an end Of preaching, cast them to the earth in prayer. Thereat Saint Dominic, who at all these things Was present, marvelled mightily at the charge Saint Francis gave, and deemed it indiscreet, Nor could conceive how all that multitude Might else support them, save by thought and care For what the body needed. But the chief Shepherd, the blessÃ¨d Christ, willing to shew What heed for His own sheep, and for His poor What tender love He had, inspired the folk Who at Perugia and Spoleto dwelt, Foligno and Assisi, and all lands Pertaining, straightway to bring food and drink Unto that holy Company. And lo! On a sudden thence came men with sumpter-mules, Horses and wagons charged with bread and wine, Honeycombs, cheese, and more good cheer to boot, According as the poor of Christ had need. Beside this, napkins, pitchers, cups, they brought, And other vessels, that might serve the turn Of such a multitude: and happy man He deemed him, who might bring the most, or do The readiest service; in such wise that even Barons and knights and other gentlefolk, Who came to gaze, did wait upon them now With deep devotion and humility. Wherefore Saint Dominic, when these things he saw Knowing of a truth that Providence divine Was working in them, humbly did confess He had misjudged Saint Francis indiscreet Touching the charge, and knelt before him there, And meekly told his fault, and added thus: âGod of a truth hath special care for these His holy poor ones, and I knew it not: And from henceforth I pledge me to observe The gospel poverty, and in God's name Denounce all Brothers of my Order who In the said Order shall presume to hold Aught in possession.â So Saint Dominic Was mightily up-builded by the faith Of the most holy Francis, and no less By the obedience and the poverty Of that so great, well-ordered fellowship, And by the Providence of God, and rich Abundance of all goodly things. Came word In the same Chapter to Saint Francis how That divers Brothers wore upon their flesh Corslets and hoops of iron, for the which cause Many were weak, some dying, and not a few Let from their prayers. Saint Francis thereupon, Like a wise Father, forthwith gave command By holy obedience, that whoso' had Corslet or hoop of iron should doff the same, And lay them at his feet: and so they did: Of corslets then were told five hundred full, Of iron hoops yet more, some for the arms, Some for the loins, so that a mighty heap They made: and there Saint Francis one and all Bade leave them. After this, the Chapter done, Saint Francis, comforting them all in good, And eke admonishing how they must escape Untainted of this evil world, with God's And his own blessing to their Provinces, Each one with spiritual joy consoled, Dismissed them. To the praise of Christ. Amen. XVIII.HOW CHRIST APPEARED TO SAINT FRANCIS, WHEN SUFFERING FROM A MALADY OF THE EYES Saint Francis with sore malady of the eyes Being one time distempered, it befel That Cardinal Ugolino, who was then Protector of the Order, in the fond Love which he bare him, wrote that he should come And visit him at Rieti, where were then For eyes the best physicians. Thereupon, This letter of the Cardinal received, Saint Francis to Saint Damian's first repaired, Where was Saint Clare, devoted Spouse of Christ, Some solace to vouchsafe her, and from thence Go to the Cardinal. But, being there, On the next night Saint Francis' eyes waxed worse, So that no glimmer of light could he discern: And, since he might not journey forth, Saint Clare Made him a little cell of reeds, wherein The better to repose: but what with pain From his infirmity, and the swarming rats Which did molest him sore, no jot of ease, Either by night or day, Saint Francis had. And seeing that of this pain and misery Yet more he needs must suffer, he 'gan think And recognise therein a scourge of God For his offences, and with all his heart, And his mouth's utterance, fell to thanking God, In a loud voice exclaiming: âO my Lord, All this deserve I, and much worse than this. Lord Jesu Christ, good Shepherd, who to us, Sinners and worthless, dost in divers pains And bodily anguish Thy compassion shew, Grant unto me, a little sheep of Thine, Virtue and grace, that for no outward ill, Anguish, or sorrow, I may part from Thee.â And, this prayer made, there came a voice from heaven: âAnswer me, Francis: were the whole earth gold, And all the seas, and springs, and rivers balm, And stones of price the mountains, hills, and rocks, And thou should'st find a treasure nobler yet Than these things areâas much as gold than earth, And balm than water is, and precious stones Than rocks and mountains, noblerâshould'st thou not Be well content and happy?â Answer made Saint Francis: âAll unworthy, Lord, am I Of such a priceless treasure.â And the voice Of God bespake him, saying: âHave thou good cheer, Francis, for this the treasure is of life Eternal, which I hold in store for thee, Against the hour when I possess thee of it; And all this trouble and pain an earnest is Of that blest treasure.â Then Saint Francis called To his companion, and, with fervent joy Filled for so glorious a promise, said: âGo we unto the Cardinal!â And, Saint Clare With holy words first comforting, he took Humbly his leave of her, and so set forth Toward Rieti. And, when now drawn nigh The city, so vast a multitude of folk Came out to meet him, that for this thing's sake He would not enter in, but to a church Betook him, which was nigh the town, perchance A two miles' journey. Then the city-folk, Learning that he was in the church, flocked forth To see him, so that the vineyard of the church Was marred, and all the grapes plucked off, whereat The priest, sore grieved at heart, repented him To have received Saint Francis in his church. Then, to Saint Francis being revealed of God What the priest thought, he called for him and said: âHow many measures, dearest Father, say, Yields thee this vineyard yearly at its best?â Quoth he: âTwelve measures.â And Saint Francis said: âI pray thee, Father, to bear patiently My sojourning some days, since good repose I find here: and let any pluck the grapes Of this thy vineyard, for the love of God And me, His little poor one: and behold! I promise in the name of Jesu Christ My Lord that twenty measures it this year Shall yield thee.â And this thing Saint Francis wrought Of his there tarrying for the mighty fruit Of souls that were seen gathered from the folk Who came there; of whom many went their way Drunken with love divine, and left the world. This promise of Saint Francis, then, the priest Trusted, and did the vineyard freely leave For those who came to him. O wonderful! The vineyard was all wasted and plucked bare, So that scarce any clusters there remained; The time of vintage came; the priest plucked off The aforesaid clusters, thrust them in the vat, Trod them, and, as Saint Francis promised him, Gat twenty measures thence of the best wine. By the which miracle is plainly given To know that, as the vineyard, spoiled of grapes, In wine abounded, so the people of Christ, Barren of virtue by their sin, should oft Through merit of Saint Francis, and the love He taught them, in good fruit abound of true Repentance. To the praise of Christ. Amen. XIX.CONCERNING A NOVICE WHO HATED THE HABIT OF SAINT FRANCIS A youth right noble and delicately reared Into the Order of Saint Francis came, Who, after some days, by the Devil impelled, 'Gan so to loathe the habit which he wore, That seemed to him he wore a sack most vile: The sleeves abhorred he, and the hood he loathed; And for their length and roughness these things seemed A load intolerable: and, more and more His hatred growing for the holy life, At last he purposed to forego the garb, And to the world return. It was his wont Already, as by his Master taught, each time He passed the Convent-altar, where was kept The Body of Christ, to fall upon his knees With utmost reverence, and draw back his hood, And bow, with arms held cross-wise. Now it chanced That on the night when he should issue forth, The altar of the Convent he must pass; And, passing it, according to his wont He knelt and did a reverence: and behold! On a sudden he was rapt in soul, and saw A marvellous vision, shewn to him of God; For he beheld before his eyes go by As 'twere an endless multitude of Saints, In form like a procession, two and two, Clad all in glorious raiment, robes of price, Faces and hands resplendent like the sun; And with angelic chants and songs they went: Among which Saints were twain more nobly clad And decked than all the others: and these were With such exceeding brightness wrapped around, That sore amazement held who looked on them: And, as it were in the procession's close, One he espied so gloriously arrayed, That he appeared a new-made Knight to be, More honoured than the others. The said youth, Seeing this vision, marvelled in himself, And wist not what the stately pomp might mean, Nor gat he heart to ask, but stood amazed By reason of its sweetness. None the less, When all the pomp had passed, he summoned heart, Ran to the hindmost, and sore-quaking asked: âPray you, belovÃ¨d, tell me who are these So wonderful, who go in this august Procession?â They replied: âKnow, little son, We are all Brothers Minor, and come now From the glory of Paradise.â And he inquired: âWho be those twain that shine beyond the rest?â âThese are Saint Francis and Saint Anthony,â They answered, âand this last, whom thou behold'st So honoured, is a holy Brother, who died Of late: the which, since he fought valiantly Against temptations, and to the end endured, Now to the glory of Paradise we lead In triumph: and this raiment that we wear, Of woof so fine, God gave us in exchange For the rough tunics, which full patiently We wore while in the Rule: and as for this So glorious brightness, thou behold'st in us, 'Twas given of God for the meek penitence And holy poverty, the which we kept With pureness and obedience to the end. Deem it, then, no hard matter, little son, To wear the sackcloth of the holy life, Which in such fruit aboundeth: seeing that if, Clad in Saint Francis' sackcloth, for Christ's love Thou spurn the world, and mortify the flesh, And 'gainst the Devil fight, and play the man, Thou shalt, as we, the selfsame garments wear, And radiance of glory.â When these words Were spoken, the youth, returning to himself, Unto the Guardian and the Brothers owned His trespass, and from that time forth desired The roughness of the penance and the robes, And in great sanctity his life did end Within the Order. To the praise of Christ. XX.THE CONVERSION OF THE WOLF OF AGOBIO What time Saint Francis at Agobio dwelt, Within Agobio's borders there appeared A wolf, gigantic, terrible, and fierce, The which devoured not beasts alone, but men, So that the city-folk stood one and all In mighty dread: for many a time he drew Nigh to their city, and all men went armed Who issued from the land, as though they went To battle: nor yet who happed on him alone Might aught prevail against him; till for fear Of the said wolf to such a pass they came, That none abroad durst venture. For which cause Saint Francis, having pity upon the folk, Would fain this wolf encounter, though all men Gave counsel to withhold him: wherefore he, Making the sign of the most holy Cross, Went forth with his companions, all his trust In God reposing; and when now the rest Misdoubted to go further, he nathless Took road toward the place where the wolf lay. And lo! in sight of many who had come forth This miracle to witness, the said wolf Made at Saint Francis with his mouth agape: And, drawing near, Saint Francis over him Did make the sign of the most holy Cross, And called him, saying: âCome hither, Brother wolf; I bid thee, in Christ's name, thou do no scathe To me, or any.â O wondrous thing to tell! No sooner had Saint Francis made the Cross, Than straightway closed his mouth the terrible wolf, And stayed his running, and, lamb-like, on command Came meekly, and, crouching at Saint Francis' feet, Lay prone. Then spake Saint Francis: âBrother wolf, Much mischief in these regions hast thou wrought, And monstrous ills, slaying and ravaging God's creatures, without leave of Him; and not Beasts only hast thou slaughtered and devoured, But hast e'en dared deface and slaughter men, Made in God's image; for the which thing's sake, As thief and heinous murderer, thou deserv'st The gibbet, and all men murmur and cry out Against thee, and all this country is thy foe. But, Brother wolf, fain would I now make peace 'Twixt thee and these, so thou sin not again, And these forgive thee thy past trespasses, And neither men nor dogs pursue thee more.â Upon the utterance of these words, the wolf With gesture of his body, and tail, and ears, And bowing of the head, gave token plain Of his assent to what Saint Francis said, And will to abide thereby. Then once again On this wise spake Saint Francis: âBrother wolf, Since thou art fain to make and keep this peace, I hereby promise, so long as thou shalt live, That I will cause the people of this land To give thee food continually, that thou No more feel hunger-pangs, for well I wot That thou through hunger all these ills hast done. But, seeing that I this grace for thee obtain, O Brother wolf, I will thou promise me No living thing henceforth, or man, or beast, To injure: dost thou promise?â And the wolf With bowing of the head gave token clear That he so promised. And Saint Francis said: âO Brother wolf, I will thou plight me troth Of this thy promise, that I may trust thee well:â And, as Saint Francis to receive the pledge Stretched forth his hand, the wolf upraised his paw, And placed it in his hand familiarly, Giving what token of good faith he could. Then said Saint Francis: âNow, O Brother wolf, I charge thee, in the name of Jesu Christ, That thou, misdoubting nothing, come with me; And let us go together in God's name To ratify this treaty.â And the wolf Obediently went with him, like a lamb For meekness, so that all the citizens, Beholding, marvelled greatly. And forthwith Through the whole country-side this wonder spread, So that all people, men and women-folk, And great alike and small, and old and young, Drew to the market-place, to see the wolf Beside Saint Francis. And when all the folk Were come together, Saint Francis rose to preach And, amongst other things, spake also this: How that for their transgressions God allowed Such ravagings, and that the fire of hell, Which for the damned doth last eternally, Is far more perilous than a mere wolf's rage, Which can but kill the body: âhow sorely then Is hell's mouth to be dreaded, when the mouth Of one small beast holds such a multitude In fear and trembling! Turn ye then to God, BelovÃ¨d, and for your sins do penance meet; And God will set you free both from the wolf In this time present, and from fires of hell Hereafter.â And, the preaching done, âGive ear, My Brothers,â quoth Saint Francis, âBrother wolf, Who stands before you here, hath promised me, And pledged his troth, to be at peace with you, No more in aught offending; and do ye Promise to give him for his daily food Such things as shall be needful: and I here Stand surety for him that this pact of peace He will unbroken keep.â Then all the folk As with one voice made promise without fail To nourish him. And Saint Francis before all Said to the wolf: âDo thou too, Brother wolf, Promise to keep with these the pact of peace, That thou do no offence to man, or beast, Or any creature.â And the wolf knelt down, And thereto bowed his head, with gestures mild Of body, and ears, and tail, as best he might, Shewing his will to keep the compact whole. Then spake Saint Francis: âBrother wolf, I will That, as without the gate thou'st plighted troth To this thy promise, so now thy promise-troth Here before all this people thou do plight, That of the surety which I gave for thee Thou wilt not cheat me.â Thereupon the wolf Raised his right paw, and in Saint Francis' hand Placed it: whereat, for this and other acts Aforesaid, in all hearts arose such joy And wonderâthrough devotion to the Saint, And eke for strangeness of the miracle, And with the wolf now being at peaceâthat all With one accord 'gan cry aloud to heaven, Lauding and blessing God, that He had sent Saint Francis, by whose merits they were freed From the fell monster's maw. And the said wolf Thereafter in Agobio lived two years, Going from house to house, and door to door, Familiarly, not injuring any man, Nor being of any injured, and therewith Was nourished by the folk full courteously; And roaming thus throughout the land, no dog E'er barked behind him. When at last two years Were ended, Brother wolf died of old age; Whereat the city-folk grieved sore, for while So tame they watched him through the city roam, The better was Saint Francis' holy life By them remembered. To the praise of Christ. XXI.CONCERNING SAINT FRANCIS AND THE TURTLE-DOVES A youth there was, who certain turtle-doves Had captured, and was carrying for to sell, When, as it happed, Saint Francis, who was aye To gentle creatures parlous pitiful, Met him, and, looking on the turtle-doves With piteous eye, said to the youth: âGood youth, I pray thee give these turtle-doves to me, That birds so gentle and so innocent, The which in holy Scripture likened are To souls chaste, meek, and faithful, may not fall Into the hands of cruel men, to slay.â Anon, by God inspired, he gave them all Unto Saint Francis, who, receiving them Within his bosom, thus 'gan tenderly Bespeak them: âO my sisters, simple doves, Chaste, innocent, why let yourselves be ta'en? Now fain would I deliver you from death, And make you nests, that ye may fruitful be, And multiply, as your Creator bade.â Then went Saint Francis and made nests for all; And they, frequenting them, began lay eggs, And hatch them e'en before the Brothers' eyes, And with Saint Francis and the rest abode Tamely consorting, like as they were fowls Fed ever by them; nay, nor e'er went forth, Until Saint Francis blessed and bade them go. And to the youth he said: âThou yet shalt be A Brother of this Order, and serve God.â And so it came to pass; for the said youth Became a Brother, and with great sanctity Lived in the Order. To Christ's praise. Amen. XXII.HOW SAINT FRANCIS SAW THE HOUSE SURROUNDED BY DEMONS, AND DROVE OUT ONE WHO HAD ENTERED IN Once, as Saint Francis prayed within the House Of Portiuncula, God oped his eyes So that he saw the whole House girt about, And, as it were with a great host, beset By demons; nathless none might enter in, Because the Brothers were of such sanctity, That into no man could the fiends win way. But while they thus persisted, so it chanced That, of these Brothers, one did take offence Against his fellow, and pondered in his heart How to accuse and be avenged of him. Wherefore, as he continued in this thought, Anon the fiend, finding the door ajar, Entered the House, and lodged him on the neck Of the said Brother. Which when he beheld, The careful shepherd, who kept ever watch Over his sheep-fold, whereinto the wolf Had entered to devour his little sheep, At once let call that Brother to himself, And bade him straight the venom of despite Conceived against his neighbour, for which cause He lay in the enemy's clutches, to disclose. Whereat he, fearful thus to find himself Detected by Saint Francis, all the spite Revealed, and all the venom, and owned his fault, And humbly sued for penance and for grace: Which done, when now assoilÃ¨d of his sin He had received the penance, suddenly Before Saint Francis' very eyes the fiend Vanished; and so from the fell monster's clutch, By the good Shepherd's kindly care, set free, The Brother thanked God, and chastened and reproved Back to the holy Shepherd's fold returned, And lived thereafter in great sanctity. Unto the blessÃ¨d Christ His praise. Amen. XXIII.HOW SAINT FRANCIS CONVERTED THE SOLDAN OF BABYLON Saint Francis for Christ's faith by zeal impelled, And by desire of martyrdom, set forth With twelve of his companions on a timeâ Right holy menâto journey oversea Straight to the Soldan's Court at Babylon. And at a country of the Saracens Arriving, where the passes were all watched By folk so cruel, that no Christian man Might' scape with life who passed there, as God willed They were not slain, but taken, scourged, and bound, And brought before the Soldan: before whom Saint Francis, by the Holy Spirit taught, Preached so devoutly of the faith of Christ, That in the cause thereof he was e'en fain To pass through fire. The Soldan thereupon 'Gan deep devotion toward him entertain, Both for the constancy of his faith, and that Contempt of the world which in him he beheldâ Since at his hand no gift would he receive, Albeit most poorânor less for the desire Which he beheld in him of martyrdom. And him thenceforth the Soldan gladly heard, And prayed return to him full oft, and gave To his companions and himself free leave To preach where pleased them, and vouchsafed a sign Whereby they might 'scape hurt of any man. Having this licence then, Saint Francis sent Those chosen companions forth by two and two To divers countries of the Saracens, Christ's faith to preach. But seeing at the last He no more fruit could in those regions reap, By divine admonition he prepared, With his companions all, to get him back Among the faithful: and, when all were brought Together, to the Soldan he returned, And took his leave of him: to whom thus spake The Soldan: âFrancis, to the faith of Christ I fain would turn me, but I fear as now To do it; since, if these were ware thereof, Both me and thee with all thy company Would they destroy; and seeing that thou may'st yet Much good perform, and many things of weight Have I to accomplish, fain would I fend off Thy death and mine: but how I may be saved Now teach me, since for aught that thou shalt bid Myself am ready.â Thereat Saint Francis said: âNow, sire, will I take leave of thee, but when To mine own country I have back returned, And passed to heaven, then by the grace of God After my death, according as God will, Two of my Brothers will I send, from whom The baptism of Christ shalt thou receive, And shalt be saved, as my Lord Jesu Christ Hath shewn me. And do thou thyself the while Loose thee from all entanglement, that when God's grace shall come to thee, thou may'st be found Ready for faith and holiness.â And he Both promised and performed it. And, this done, Saint Francis with that reverend fellowship Of blest companions turned him home again, And after certain years, through bodily death, Rendered his soul to God. And, fallen sick, The Soldan for Saint Francis' promise looked, And, guards at certain passes having set, Gave charge that, if two Brothers passed that way Clad in Saint Francis' habit, they should be Brought to him straightway. At that time appeared Saint Francis to two Brothers, bidding them Make no delay, but to the Soldan go, And compass his salvation, even as he Had promised: the which Brothers instantly Set forth, and crossed the sea, and by those guards Were to the Soldan brought: and, seeing them, The Soldan said: âNow know I of a truth That God hath sent His servants me to save, The which Saint Francis promised, as by God Revealed to him.â Receiving then the truth By the said Brothers taught, and being thus New-born in Christ, he of this sickness died, And through Saint Francis' prayers his soul was saved. XXIV.HOW SAINT FRANCIS HEALED A LEPER IN BODY AND SOUL Saint Francis, true disciple of the Christ, While in this miserable life he lived, With all his strength did strive to follow Christ, The perfect Master: whence full oft befel, By divine operation, that of whom He healed the body, in the self-same hour God healed the soul, e'en as of Christ we read. Wherefore not only did he gladly serve Folk leprous, but moreover had enjoined The Brothers of his Order through the world Going, or staying, leprous folk to serve Gladly for love of Christ, who for our sake Willed to be deemed a leper. It befel Once in a certain place, not far from where Saint Francis sojourned, that the Brothers served Sick folk and leprous in a hospital, Wherein a leper so impatient was, Froward, and petulant, that all men deemed, And deemed him truly, by the Devil possessed. For he so shamefully with words abused, And beat, who served him, yea, and what was worse, With such outrageous blasphemies reviled Christ and His Holy Mother, that by no means Might there be found, who serve him would, or could. And though the wrongs and insults to themselves Full patiently the Brothers strove to bear, Merit of patience to increase thereby, Yet, since their consciences those wrongs to Christ, And to His Mother, brooked not to endure, At length resolved they to abandon him, Yet would not, till the thing was notified In order to Saint Francis. And so soon As they had made it known, Saint Francis came To this so fractious leper, and drew near, And did salute him, saying: âGod give thee peace, My dearest Brother!â And the leper replied Bitterly: âNay, what peace to me from God, Who hath ta'en from me peace and every good, And made me foul and noisome utterly?â Saint Francis said: âHave patience, little son, Since ills of body are given to us of God In this world for soul's saving, seeing that they Are of great merit, when borne patiently.â Replied the sick man: âHow can I endure In peace the pain that racks me, night and day? Nor of my sickness am I racked alone, But those thy Brethren, whom thou gav'st to serve, Entreat me worse, nor serve not as they should.â Thereat, by revelation from on high, Saint Francis knowing this leper was possessed By an ill spirit, gat him to his prayers, And earnestly made suit to God for him. And, his prayer ended, he returned, and said: âMyself am fain to serve thee, little son, Since with these others thou art ill-content.â Quoth the sick man: âIt liketh me, nathless What better than the rest canst thou?â Replied Saint Francis: âI will do whate'er thou would'st.â Quoth the sick man: âI will from head to foot Thou wash me, seeing that so corrupt am I, That I myself endure not.â Then forthwith Saint Francis bade boil water, with sweet herbs A many, and stripped him, and began With his own hands to wash him, and meanwhile A Brother poured on water; and behold! By divine virtue, and by miracle, Where with his holy hands Saint Francis touched, The leprosy departed, and the flesh Was healÃ¨d utterly. And, as to heal The flesh began, so too 'gan heal the soul: Wherefore, perceiving health new-born in him, Contrition sore the leper now 'gan feel, And penitence for his sins, and fell anon To bitterest weeping; insomuch that, while His body was made clean of leprosy, By washing of the water, so from sin Was his soul cleansed by penitential tears. And now, both body and soul made wholly clean, Humbly did he confess his fault, and said, In a loud voice lamenting: âWoe is me! Worthy of hell am I for outrage done And insult to the Brothers, and toward God For mine impatience and blaspheming words.â And so for fifteen days in bitter plaints For sin persÃ©vered he, and prayers to God For mercy, and full confession to the priest. And when so marked a miracle, as God Had by his hands performed, Saint Francis saw, Returning thanks to God, he parted thence, And 'gat him to a country-place far off; Wishing in his humility to shun All worldly glory, and in every deed God's glory and and honour, not his own, to seek. Soon, as God willed it, the said leper, healed In body and soul, did, after fifteen days Of penitence, sicken of a new plague, and, armed With holy church-rites, died in sanctity, And his soul passed to Paradise. And lo! For sign thereof, his spirit in the air Appeared unto Saint Francis, as he prayed, And said to him: âRememberest thou me?â âWho art thou?â quoth Saint Francis. He replied: âI am that leper, whom the blessÃ¨d Christ Healed through thy merits, and to-day I pass To Paradise: wherefore to God and thee My thanks I render: blessÃ¨d be thy soul And body, and blessÃ¨d be thy words and deeds: For that by thee shall many souls be saved Throughout the world: and know there is no day When the holy Angels, and what Saints beside, Return not thanks to God for the blest fruits Gathered in divers regions of the world By thee and by thine Order: for which cause Be comforted, thank God, and still abide Beneath His benediction.â And, these words Spoken, anon he passed into the heaven, And therewithal Saint Francis did remain Much comforted. Unto the praise of Christ. XXV.HOW THREE ROBBERS WERE CONVERTED BY SAINT FRANCIS Once, as Saint Francis through the region went Of Borgo San Sepolcro, and was now Passing a certain village, that had name Monte Casale, came to him a youth Noble and delicately reared, who said: âFain am I, father, of thy Brotherhood To be.â Saint Francis answered: âLittle Son, Young art thou, noble, and delicately reared: Belike thou could'st not bear the poverty And roughness that is ours.â And he replied: âAre ye not men, my father, even as I? What ye can bear, then, I, please God, shall bear.â And since this answer liked Saint Francis well, Within the Order he forthwith received, And blessed, and named him Brother Angelo. And with such grace this youth bestowed himself, That soon Saint Francis made him of the House Of Monte Casale Guardian. At that time Three famous robbers did the land infest, Who wrought much evil through the country-side: And one day, coming to the Brothers' House, They prayed the Guardian, Brother Angelo, Some food to give them: and the Guardian Replied on this wise, harshly chiding them: âRobbers and cruel murderers, shame ye not To reave the toils of others? Nay, but more! Bare-faced and insolent ye would e'en devour The alms that on God's servants are bestowed: Unworthy are ye earth should bear your weight, Since man, nor God who made you, ye regard: Begone then, and affront our eyes no more!â So fuming, in high dudgeon off they went. And lo! Saint Francis, who had gone forth, returned With wallet of bread and flask of wine, the which He had begged with his companion: and when now The Guardian told how he had driven them off, Saint Francis sharply chid him, saying therein He had borne him cruelly, for that sinful folk Better by sweetness are, than harsh rebuke, Brought back to God: whence God our Master saithâ Whose gospel we have promised to obeyâ âThey that be whole do no physician need, But the sick rather;â and that He had come Not righteous, nay, but sinful folk, to call Unto repentance; wherefore many a time He ate with them. Since then thou hast herein 'Gainst Charity and God's holy gospel wrought, By holy obedience I command thee take Forthwith this wallet of bread which I have begged, And eke this flask of wine, and get thee gone, And diligently pursue o'er hill and vale, Until thou find them, and, when found, from me With all this bread present them, and this wine; And kneel before them, and therewith confess Humbly thy fault of cruelty, and so Entreat them, as from me, to sin no more, But fear God, nor offend their neighbour, which If they will do, I pledge me to provide For all their needs, and give them food and drink Continually: and when thou hast so said, Hither return right humbly.â Therewithal While the said Guardian was gone forth to do His bidding, Saint Francis gat him to his prayers, Beseeching God those robbers' hearts to melt, And turn them unto penitence. Meanwhile The obedient Guardian, coming up with them, Gave them the bread and wine, nor left undone Aught that Saint Francis bade. And it pleased God, As of Saint Francis' alms those robber-folk Were eating, they 'gan say among themselves: âAlas, poor wretches! what hard pains of hell Await us, who not only go about Robbing our neighbours, dealing blows and wounds, But likewise slaying, and none the less for deeds So ill and heinous feel no whit remorse Of conscience, nay, nor fear of God! and see! This holy Brother, who hath come to us, For certain words the which he justly spake Against our wickedness, hath humbly owned His fault, and brought us bread and wine to boot, And from the holy Father's lips so large A promise! These Brothers verily be Saints Of God, who merit Paradise; and we Sons of perdition without end, who now Merit the pains of hell, and day by day But add to our damnation: nor know we If for the sins wrought hitherto by us We may of God find mercy.â As one of them These and like words did speak, the other twain Said: âVerily sooth thou speakest, but behold! What must we do?â âLet us e'en go,â quoth he, Unto Saint Francis: âif he give us hope That for our sins we may God's mercy find, Do we whate'er he bids us, that our souls We may deliver from the pains of hell.â This counsel liked the others, so all the three Went to Saint Francis with one mind, and said: âFor many heinous sins that we have done, Father, God's mercy we not think to find; Nathless, if thou hast any hope that God Will take us to His mercy, we are here Fain to perform thy bidding, and with thee Do penance.â Then Saint Francis welcomed them In lovingkindness and in charity, With manifold examples comforting Their hearts, and of God's mercy made them sure, Yea, promised to obtain it them of God, Shewing them how God's mercy hath no bound, And, though our sins were boundless, yet the grace Of God is greater, and how the blessÃ¨d Christ, As Gospel saith, and holy Apostle Paul, Came into this world, sinners to redeem. By the which words, and others like to these, Admonished, the three robbers did renounce The devil and all his works, and were received Into the Order at Saint Francis' hand, And 'gan to do great penance: and twain of them Lived after their conversion a brief while, And passed to Paradise; but the third survived, And, of his sins repenting, set himself To do such penance, that for fifteen years Continuously, save for the Lenten use, The which he kept in such wise as the rest, At other time, three days o' the week he fared On bread and water, going bare-foot still, One tunic on his back, and, Matins o'er, Slept never. About that time Saint Francis passed From out this miserable life. He then Having this penance many years fulfilled, Lo! after Matins came to him one night Of sleep such strong desire, that by no means Might he refrain from slumber, or keep watch, As he was wont to do. And since from sleep Refrain he could not, no nor pray, at last He gat him to repose, and suddenly, Soon as he laid his head down, he was rapt And borne in spirit to a great mountain-height, Where was a precipice exceeding deep, On this side and on that rocks torn and jagg'd, And broken boulders jutting from the rocks; So that adown that precipice to peer Was fearsome gazing. And the Angel-form, The which did lead this Brother, pushed him on, And threw him down the precipice: and he, Tumbling and bounding on from rock to rock, From boulder on to boulder, reached at last The bottom of that precipice piece-meal Mangled and shattered, as it seemed to him. And as in this sore plight on earth he lay, His leader thus bespake him: âGet thee up, For a long journey thou hast yet to make.â Replied the Brother: âAn ill-advisÃ¨d man Thou seem'st, and cruel, who see'st me like to die Of the fall that hath shattered me, and yet Biddest me rise.â Then came the Angel near, And with a touch healed perfectly his limbs, And made him sound. And, after, shewed he him A mighty plain full of sharp cutting stones, And thorns and briars, and said through all that plain He must pass bare-foot till he reached the end, Where a fierce furnace he espied, the which He needs must enter. When the Brother had passed O'er all that plain with anguish and sore hurt, âGet thee into this furnace,â said to him The Angel, âfor needs must thou.â He replied, âAlas! how cruel a guide thou art to me, Who seest me by this agonising plain Brought nigh to death, and bid'st me now for rest Enter yon blazing furnace!â And he looked And in the furnace many devils saw With iron forks in hand, wherewith, since he Shirked entrance, they of a sudden thrust him in. And having now within the furnace passed, He looked about him, and saw one, had been His godfather, on fire from head to foot: And he enquired: âUnhappy godfather, How cam'st thou hither?â And he replied: âGo on A little further yet, and thou shalt find My wife, thy gossip, who will relate to thee The cause of our damnation.â Thereupon The Brother went onward, till before his eyes Lo! the said gossip, wrapt in fire, and penned In a corn-bushel that was all aflame! And he enquired: âUnhappy gossip, say Wherefore to this fell torment art thou come?â âBecause in the great famine-time,â quoth she. âThe which Saint Francis prophesied erewhile, I and my husband of the wheat and grain We sold did give false measure; wherefore I Penned in this bushel burn.â Upon which word The Angel led this Brother, and thrust him forth From out the furnace, and then said to him: âGird thee a fearful journey to perform, The which thou needs must travel.â And he spake Complaining bitterly: âO most cruel guide, Who hast no pity upon me! for thou seest That in this furnace I am all burnt up, And yet would'st lead me by a perilous road And fearful!â And thereat the Angel touched, And made him whole and strong. And after this He brought him to a bridge he might not cross Without great peril, seeing that it was frail, And narrow, and very slippery, and had No rail to flank it: and thereunder lapsed A terrible river full of serpent-things, Dragons and scorpions, that sent up therefrom A stench most noisome; and the Angel said: âCross now this bridge, since cross it needs thou must.â âHow shall I skill to cross it,â he replied, âSo that I fall not in this perilous flood?â The Angel said: âCome after me, and set Thy feet where thou shalt see that I set mine, And so shalt thou cross well.â The Brother crossed Behind the Angel, as he had bidden him, To midmost of the bridge, and as he stood Thus at its midmost, forth the Angel flew, And left him, and to a great mountain-height Departed, from the said bridge far enow On the other side. And he marked well the place Whither had flown the Angel; but, left thus, Without a guide, and gazing therebelow, He saw those terrible monsters standing forth, Heads above water, and with mouths agape, Ready to swallow him, if he fell. Thereat Such terror held him, that he wist no whit Or what to do, or say; since turn him back He could not, nor go forward. Whereupon Seeing himself in strait so sore, that he None other refuge had, but God alone, He bowed him, and in both arms clasped the bridge, And with his whole heart, weeping, unto God Commended him, if peradventure He Of His most holy ruth might succour him. And, the prayer done, him seemed that he began To put forth wings; whereat with mighty joy He waited for their growing, that he might fly Beyond the bridge, whither the Angel flew. Then, after some time, in his strong desire To cross the bridge, he set himself to fly, But, since the wings were not yet large enow, Fell on the bridge, and off the feathers dropped. Wherefore once more he clasped the bridge, to God, As at the first, commending him: and when His prayer was done, a second time he seemed To put forth wings, but once more waited not Their perfect growth, and so, before the time Essaying to fly, fell on the bridge again, And off the feathers dropped. And, seeing that he Had fallen by reason of the haste he had To fly before the time, he 'gan to speak Thus with himself: âIf I shall put forth wings A third time, of a surety I will wait Till they be grown so large that I can fly, Nor fall again.â And, thinking on this wise, He saw himself the third time put forth wings, And long he waited till they were full large; And in this putting forth of wings once, twice, And thrice, it seemed to him he had waited more Than hundred years and fifty. And at last For the third time he rose to fly, and up With all his strength flew even to the place Where the Angel was: and at the palace-door Knocking, whereinto had the Angel flown, The porter asked him: âWho art thou, that hast Come hither?â âA Brother Minor I,â quoth he: Then said the porter: âTarry, that I may bring Saint Francis, for to learn if thee he know.â And, while to fetch Saint Francis he was gone, He fell to gazing on the marvellous walls Of the said palace; and these walls appeared Of such translucent brightness, that he saw The Choirs of Saints, and what was wrought within, Full clearly. And, as spell-bound thus he stood Gazing thereon, behold! Saint Francis came, With Brother Bernard, and with Brother Giles; And in Saint Francis' train so vast a host Of Saints and saintly women, who his life Had followed, as nigh numberless appeared. And, drawing near, unto the porter spake Saint Francis: âLet him enter, seeing that he Is of my Brothers.â And, once entered in, Such sweetness felt he, that he clean forgot All he had suffered, as though it ne'er had been. And now Saint Francis, leading him within, Shewed him a many marvellous things, and thus At length bespake him: âThou must needs return Unto the world, my Son, and there abide Seven days, wherein do thou prepare thyself With all devotion diligently; for I After those seven days will come for thee, And with me thereupon shalt thou return Unto this dwelling of the blest.â And lo! Saint Francis was in marvellous robe arrayed, Embroidered-o'er with stars right glorious; And his five stigmata were as five stars For glory, and of such splendour, that the whole Palace they did illumine with their rays. And Brother Bernard had upon his head A crown of stars full beauteous to behold, And Brother Giles in wondrous light was decked; And 'midst them many another Saint he knew, Whom in the world he ne'er had looked upon. So, of Saint Francis taking now his leave, Albeit full loth, returned he back to earth Waking; and lo! as to himself he came, And his own wits, the Brothers rang for Prime; So that he had not save from Matin-hour Been of that vision holden until Prime, Albeit to him it had seemed many years. And, having all this vision point by point Told o'er, within the seven days he fell Sick of a fever; then on the eighth day Saint Francis, as he had promised, came for him With a vast multitude of glorious Saints, And to the kingdom of the blissful ones Of life eternal did conduct his soul. Unto the blessÃ¨d Christ His praise. Amen. XXVI.HOW SAINT FRANCIS WENT TO BOLOGNA, AND CONVERTED TWO SCHOLARS BY HIS PREACHING When to Bologna-city on a time Saint Francis came, the city-folk ran all Together for to see him; and so dense The throng of people, that with much ado Scarce could they gain the Square: and when the Square Was now with men and women wholly filled, And eke with scholars, in their midst uprose Saint Francis, and 'gan preach what words so-e'er The Holy Spirit taught him: and he preached Matters so wondrous, that it seemed to them There preached an Angel, rather than a man: Yea, and the heavenly words, he spake, appeared Like to keen arrows which did pierce their hearts Who heard him, that great multitudes of men And women-folk, as he so preached, were turned To penitence. And of this number were Two noble students from Ancona's March, Whereof one Pellegrino had to name, And the other Ruggieri: the which both, By divine inspiration touched at heart, Through the said preaching, to Saint Francis came, Saying their whole wish was to quit the world, And become Brothers. Then Saint Francis, knowing By revelation from on high that these Were sent of God, and would the holy life Observe within the Order, when he saw How great their fervour, gladly welcomed them, Saying: âThou, Pellegrino, from henceforth The lowly life shalt follow, and serve thou The Brethren, Ruggieri.â And e'en so It was: for Pellegrino would not come As Cleric, but lay Brother, though right learn'd, And master of canonic law; by which Humility such perfection he attained In holiness, that Brother Bernard even, Saint Francis' first-born, spake of him as one Of the most perfect Brothers in this world. Finally Brother Pellegrino passed From this life to the beatific life Nor without many miracles, or wrought Before his death, or after. Therewithal Did Brother Ruggieri faithfully And with devotion serve the Brotherhood In holiness and humbleness of life, And with Saint Francis to close friendship came; And many secrets unto him revealed Saint Francis. And, when now made Minister Of the Province of Ancona's March, long time In utmost peace, full wisely, held he sway. After some time, God suffered visit him A right sore tempting of his soul, that he In trouble and anguish sternly schooled himself With fasts, and tears, and scourgings, night and day, Yet none the more could that temptation oust; But many a time he was in deep despair, And deemed himself forsaken of God. And still Continuing desperate, for last remedy Unto Saint Francis he resolved to go, Thus reasoning: âIf with kindly countenance Saint Francis, as mine old familiar friend, Receive me, then shall I believe that God Will yet have pity upon me; but, if not, 'Twill be a sign I am forsaken of God.â So forth he fared, and to Saint Francis went Who in the Bishop's Palace at that time, Lay at Assisi, grievous sick. To him Was the said Brother's whole temptation shewn By God, and his despair, and therewithal His purpose, and his coming. Whereupon Saint Francis straight for Brother Leo sent, And Brother Masseo, saying to them: âGo forth, And meet upon the way my most dear Son And Brother, Ruggieri, and from me Embrace him and salute, and say to him That of all Brothers that are in the world In special love I hold him.â So they went, And Brother Ruggieri on the way Found, and embraced him, and delivered all Saint Francis had enjoined them. Whereupon Was such deep consolation in his soul, And sweetness, that he seemed indeed as one Beside himself, and, rendering thanks to God With his whole heart, went onward, and arrived Where lay Saint Francis sick. Who, when he heard That Brother Ruggieri now drew nigh, Albeit right ill at ease, no whit the less Uprose, and went to meet, and tenderly Embraced him, saying: âMy dearest little Son And Brother, Ruggieri, among all The Brothers of the world in special love I hold thee.â And, this said, he made the sign Of the most holy Cross upon his brow, And kissed him there, and, after, said to him: âMy little Son most dear, for thy great gain And merit hath God this trial thee allowed: But, of the said gain if thou would'st no more, Then have it not.â O wonderful! for lo! Soon as Saint Francis spoke, forthwith the whole Temptation left him, even as he had ne'er In all his life felt it; and he remained Fulfilled of comfort. To the praise of God. XXVII.HOW BROTHER BERNARD OF QUINTAVALLE WAS ENTRANCED FROM MATINS UNTIL NONES What grace full many a time God wrought in those Poor gospellers, who for God's love the world Abandoned, was in Brother Bernard found Of Quintavalle, who, when he had donned Saint Francis' habit, was oft rapt in God Through contemplation of celestial things. And, among other times, a time there came, When, for to hear Mass being in church, and all His mind in God uplifted, he became Through contemplation so absorbed in Godâ Ravished and raptâthat when the Body of Christ Was raised aloft, he nothing saw thereof, Nor kneeled, nor drew his hood back, as did all The others there, but, without blink of eye, Gazing thus fixedly, continued so From Matins until Nones, regarding naught: And, after Nones, come to himself, he went Crying in tones of wonder through the House: âO Brothers, Brothers, Brothers! there is none So great or noble in all this land, that, were Some glorious, gold-filled palace promised him, He would not gladly bear a sack of dung, Treasure to win so noble!â Even for this Celestial treasure, to God-lovers all Promised, was Brother Bernard fore-ordained And was in thought so lifted up to God, That fifteen years unceasingly he went Ever with heart and face upturned to heaven, Nor all that time his hunger quelled, albeit Of what was set before him he would eat A little: for he was wont to say, whereof A man not tasted, practised he therefrom No perfect abstinence: but true abstinence Is to be temperate in such things as are Sweet to the palate. Whereby he attained Such clarity and light of intellect, That even great Doctors flocked to him, to probe Deep and hard questions, or solve knotty points Of Scripture; and with ease he made them clear. And, since his mind was wholly loosed and freed From earthly things, he, like the swallow, flew Upward through contemplation: whence one time For twenty days, once thirty, he remained Alone upon the loftiest mountain-tops, In meditation upon heavenly things. For which cause Brother Giles would say of him, That to none else of men was given this gift, That unto Brother Bernard had been given Of Quintavalle, to wit, that, swallow-like, Upon the wing he fed: and many a time, For this most excellent grace he had of God, Saint Francis loved to talk with him by night, Or day; whence sometimes they were night-long found Together, rapt in God, within a wood, Where they had met, they twain, to speak of God, The ever, and for ever, blest. Amen. XXVIII.HOW THE DEVIL APPEARED TO BROTHER RUFFINO IN THE FORM OF CHRIST Brother Ruffino, of Assisi's folk One of the noblest, a right saintly man, Companion of Saint Francis, on a time Was by the Devil with his most rude aasaults, Touching predestination, buffeted; Whereby full heavy of soul he was and sad, For that the Devil put into his heart That he was damned, nor numbered among those To endless life predestined, and that all He did within the Order was but lost. And, this temptation ever day by day Continuing, for shame's sake he shewed it not Unto Saint Francis, nor nathless forbore His wonted orisons and fasts to keep: Whereat the Adversary anon 'gan add Sorrow to sorrow, and, over and above Strifes inward, 'gan beset him from without With lying phantoms. Wherefore on a time In the form of the Crucified he appeared to him, And said: âO Brother Ruffino, wherefore thus Afflict thyself with penances and prayers, Seeing thou art not numbered among those To endless life predestined? Well I wot, Believe me, whom I have chosen and foreordained; And, as for Peter Bernardone's son, Believe him not if he say contrary, Nor ask him of this matter; since nor he Nor any else doth wot of it, but I, Who am the Son of God. Believe me then Thou art full surely numbered with the damned: Nor hath it pleased me make of mine elect Thy Father, Peter Bernardone's son; Nay neither him nor thee; damned therewithal His father is, and duped who followeth him.â These words thus spoken, he suddenly disappeared; And Brother Ruffino 'gan therewith to be So darkly overshadowed by the Prince Of darkness, that anon all faith and love He lost, which for Saint Francis he had had, Nor list he tell him aught of it. But lo! What to the holy Father was not told By Brother Ruffino, that the Holy Ghost Revealed to him: wherefore it came to pass That, when Saint Francis saw in spirit how great The peril of the said Brother was, he sent To call him Brother Masseo; unto whom Quoth Brother Ruffino bitterly: âWhat have I To do with Brother Francis?â Then, fulfilled With divine wisdom, Brother Masseo saw The trickery of the Devil, and said to him: âO Brother Ruffino, this then know'st thou not, That as God's Angel Brother Francis is, Who hath so many souls i' the world illumed, Yea, from whom we the grace of God received? Whence by all means I will thou come to him, For that I see full clearly thou art duped Of the Devil.â And Brother Ruffino, at this word, Arose, and to Saint Francis went, and when Saint Francis saw him coming from afar, âO Brother Ruffino,â he 'gan cry to him, âThou naughty one, in whom hast thou believed?â And, Brother Ruffino coming up to him, Saint Francis point by point recounted o'er His whole temptation by the Evil One, Inward or outward, shewing him full plain That he which had appeared to him was not Christ, but the Devil, and by no means must he Yield to his prompting; âbut, when saith the Fiend: âDamned art thou,â then make answer: âOpe thy mouth, And take this filth therein.â And let this be Thy token he is the Evil One; for when Thou thus shalt answer, he will straightway flee. Hereby too may'st thou know he was the Devil, In that thy heart he hardened to all good, Which is his proper office; whereas Christ, The blessÃ¨d, hardeneth ne'er the faithful heart, Nay, softeneth it, as by the Prophet's mouth He saith: âYour stone heart I will take away, And give you a heart of flesh.ââ And when he saw How that Saint Francis thus in order told Both his temptation and the manner thereof, Pricked by his words, 'gan Brother Ruffino weep Full loud, and at Saint Francis' feet to fall, And humbly own his fault in having hid This his temptation. Thus did he remain Consoled and strengthened by the admonishments Of the holy Father, and to better things Changed utterly. At the last Saint Francis said: âGo and confess thee, nor abate thy zeal, Or wonted prayers; and of a surety know That this temptation shall to thy great gain And solace tend, as shortly thou shalt prove.â Then Brother Ruffino to his cell returned Within the wood; and as with many tears He was a-praying, behold! the Adversary In outward guise like unto God! who said: âO Brother Ruffino, spake I not to thee âBelieve not Peter Bernardone's son, And weary not thyself with tears and prayers, Since thou art damnedâ? What need to plague thee thus The while thou livest, and after death be damned?â And suddenly Brother Ruffino answered him: âOpen thy mouth, and take this filth therein:â Whereat the Devil in wrath straight gat him gone, And with such storm and shaking of the rocks, Which from the mountain that soared hard at hand Came tumbling, that the hurly of those rocks Lasted full long, as they fell ruining down: And with so vast a crash, rolled each on each, Smote they together, that the nether plain Was all lit up with terrible gleams of fire. And at the fearful uproar wrought thereby Saint Francis and his fellows from the House Came issuing in great wonder, to behold What this new thing might be. And to this day That mighty ruin of the rocks is seen. Then Brother Ruffino did full plain perceive It was the Devil had fooled him. Whereupon, Returning to Saint Francis, once again He cast him to the earth, and owned his fault; And him Saint Francis with sweet words consoled, And sent him to his cell quite comforted; Wherein as full devoutly he abode, Appeared the blessÃ¨d Christ, and all his soul With love divine rekindled, saying to him: âIn this thou hast done well, my Son, that thou Believed'st Brother Francis, seeing that he Who had distressed thee was the Devil, but I Am Christ, thy Master; and, that thou may'st know Surely that I am Christ, this sign thereof I give thee: never, while thy life-days last, Shalt thou know sorrow or heart-heaviness.â And, with the word, Christ vanished, leaving him There with such joy and sweetness of the soul, And mind-uplifting, that by day and night He was absorbed and rapt in God. Withal From that time forth so strong he grew in grace And surety of salvation, that indeed He was changed wholly to another man, And would have passed both day and night in prayer And meditation upon things divine, Had the rest suffered it. And for this cause Saint Francis wont to say of himâto wit Of Brother Ruffinoâthat he was indeed In this life canonized by Jesu Christ, Nor, save when present, would spare to call him Saint Ruffino, though yet living on the earth. Unto the praise of Jesu Christ. Amen. XXIX.HOW SAINT FRANCIS BADE BROTHER RUFFINO PREACH NAKED, AND AFTER DID THE LIKE HIMSELF Now the said Brother Ruffino was so far Through ceaseless contemplation lost in God, That as one senseless he became, and mute, And spake full seldom: therewithal nor grace To preach had he, nor eloquence of tongue. Nathless Saint Francis bade him on a time Go to Assisi, and preach unto the folk, As God inspired him. Thereupon replied Brother Ruffino: âReverend Father mine, Prithee forbear me this, and send me not, For that thou knowest I have no gift to preach, And am a simple, witless man.â Then said Saint Francis: âSince thou not obey'st forthright, By holy obedience I command thee now Strip to the waist, and to Assisi go, And, entering there a church, in thy bare skin Preach to the people.â Upon this behest, Brother Ruffino doffed his gear, and so Went to Assisi, and, entering a church, Did reverence to the altar, and anon Clomb to the pulpit, and essayed to preach: Whereat the children and the men 'gan laugh, And say among themselves: âThese fellows, see, Practise such penances, that they become Fools, and beside themselves.â In the mean time Saint Francis of the prompt obedience shewn By Brother Ruffinoâ'mong Assisi's folk One of the noblest-bornâbethinking him, And of the harsh behest himself had given, 'Gan now take blame unto himself, and say: âFrom whence hast thou such arrogance, O son Of Peter Bernardone, thou vile wretch, Thus to bid Brother Ruffino, being one Of the most noble of Assisi's folk, Go preach to the people naked, like a fool? By God, thou shalt in thine own person prove The task thou lay'st on others.â And suddenly In fervour of soul he likewise doffed his clothes, And went to Assisi, and along with him Took Brother Leo, his own garb to bear, And Brother Ruffino's. When the Assisan folk Saw him like-fashioned, they made mock of him, Deeming both him and Brother Ruffino crazed By o'er much penance. And Saint Francis passed Within the church, as Brother Ruffino now These words was preaching: âFlee the world, belovÃ¨d, And let go sin; render to all their dues, An ye would 'scape from hell; keep God's commands, God and your neighbour loving, would ye go To heaven; and if heaven's kingdom ye would win, Do penance.â Then Saint Francis, all unclad, Clomb to the pulpit, and began to preach In wise so wondrous of contempt o' the world, Of holy penitence, willing poverty, And fervent longing for the realm of heaven, Yea, of the nakedness and shame withal Of the passion of Christ Jesu, that all those Who heard that preaching 'gan to weep right sore, With such devoutness and contrition of heart As might not be believed: nor only there, But throughout all Assisi, on that day, There was such weeping for the passion of God, As like thereto was never. And the folk Being in such wise by Saint Francis' act, And Brother Ruffino's, cheered and edified, Anon Saint Francis donned his gear again, And Brother Ruffino his: and, thus re-clad, Back to the House of Portiuncula Returned they, glorifying and praising God, Who had vouchsafed them grace, through scorn of self, Themselves to conquer, and God's little sheep By good ensample edify, and shew How profitable a thing to spurn the world. Yea, and so waxed to-them-ward on that day The people's worship, that, who might but touch Their garments' hem, did deem himself thereby BlessÃ¨d. Unto the praise of Christ. Amen. XXX.HOW SAINT FRANCIS KNEW THE VIRTUES AND THE FRAILTIES OF HIS COMPANIONS As saith in the Gospel our Lord Jesu Christ: âI know my sheep, and eke am known of Mine,â E'en so the holy Francis, Father blest, Like a good shepherd, every merit knew And grace of his companions, as by God Revealed to him, nor less their faults discerned; And therefore skilled he to provide for all Best remediesâto wit, humbling the proud, And lifting up the lowly, chiding vice, And praising virtue; even as one reads Touching the revelations made to him Of his first family; among which we find That while Saint Francis in a certain House With the said family held discourse of Godâ Brother Ruffino being at that discourse Not present with them, for that he abode Within the wood in meditation raptâ They still continuing in discourse of God, Lo! Brother Ruffino issued from the wood, And passed some distance from them. Whereupon Saint Francis, seeing him, to his comrades turned, And asked them, saying: âWhom deem ye in your hearts The holiest soul God hath i' the world to-day?â And, these replying they deemed it was his own, Saint Francis said to them: âBrothers belov'd, I verily am the vilest man God hath In this world: but behold ye now where comes Brother Ruffino issuing from the wood? Lo! it hath been revealed to me of God, His soul is one of the three holiest souls God hath in this world: and I say to you, And do avouch the same, I would not stick To call him Saint Ruffino while he lives, Seeing his soul hath been confirmed in grace, And sanctified in heaven, and canonised By my Lord Jesu Christ.â These words nathless, Brother Ruffino being by, ne'er spake Saint Francis. In like manner he discerned The frailties of the Brothers: so he read Brother Elias clearly, many a time Rebuking him for arrogance, and likewise To Brother John o' the Chapel prophesied That by the throat himself should hang himself; And so too told that Brother how he saw The devil that gripped him by the throat, when chid For disobedience: beside many more, Whose virtues and defects he clearly knew, As was by God revealed to him. Amen. XXXI.HOW BROTHER MASSEO OBTAINED THE VIRTUE OF HUMILITY The first companions of Saint Francis strove With all their strength to be in earthly things Full poor, and rich in virtues, whereby man To the true heavenly riches doth attain That are eternal. Now there came a day, Being met to speak of God, that one of them Did this example give: âA mighty friend Of God there was, who had great grace of life In act and contemplation, and withal Was of such wondrous deep humility, That of all sinners himself deemed he chief: The which humility did sanctify And strengthen him in grace, still making him To grow in virtue and the gifts of God, Nor ever into sinful act let fall.â When Brother Masseo of humility Heard tell such wondrous matters, witting well It was the treasure of eternal life, Such love and longing 'gan to fire his soul For this same lowly virtue, that anon, In ardour deep raising his face to heaven, He vowed and straitly purposed nevermore To joy in this world till within his soul He felt that virtue perfectly. Thenceforth Continued he nigh prisoned in his cell, Wearing the flesh down with fasts, vigils, prayers, And loud lamentings in the face of God, To win from Him that virtue, lacking which Worthy of hell he deemed him, and wherewith Yon friend of God, of whom he had heard tell, Was dowered so richly. And, in this desire For many days continuing, came a day When Brother Masseo passed within the wood In fervour of soul, and weeping walked therethrough With sighs and cries to God of warm desire, This heavenly virtue craving to obtain. And, since God gladly hearkeneth the prayers Of contrite hearts and lowly, as he prayed There came a voice from heaven which called him twice: âBrother Masseo, Brother Masseo!â Then Knowing in spirit it was the voice of Christ, âMy Lord, my Lord!â he answered: and Christ spake: âWhat wilt thou give to have this grace of Me?â And Brother Masseo answered: âO my Lord, I would e'en give the eyes from out my head.â And Christ spake to him: âI will thou have the grace, And thine eyes also.â And, this said, the voice Vanished, and Brother Masseo there remained Filled with such virtue of humilityâ The grace he longed forâand the light of God, That he was ever jubilant from that hour, And oft, when praying, would shape his joy to sound Like to a dove's soft cooing, oo, oo, oo, And with glad countenance and joyful heart Remain in contemplation: and therewith, Being most humble grown, he deemed himself The least of all men in the world. And when By Brother James of Fallerone asked Wherefore his joyful tune he never changed, Full blithely he replied that whoso' found All good in one thing needed not to change His tune. Unto the praise of God. Amen. XXXII.HOW SAINT CLARE BLEST THE LOAVES Saint Clare, devoted follower of Christ's Cross, And of Saint Francis a renownÃ¨d plant, Was of such sanctity, that not alone Bishops and Cardinals, but the Pope himself Right earnestly desired to see and hear, And oft in person went to visit, her. And one time, among other times, he came Unto the Convent, for to hear her speak Of heavenly things divine: and, being thus Together met in holy communing, Saint Clare meanwhile bade ready spread the board, And set the bread thereon, that it might be Blest of the Holy Father. Wherefore now, Soon as their ghostly talk had end, Saint Clare On bended knee, with utmost reverence, Besought that it might please him bless the bread Set thus upon the table. Whereunto Replied the Holy Father: âSister Clare, Most faithful Daughter, I desire that thou Do bless this bread, and make thereon the sign Of the Cross of God, whereto thou'rt wholly given.â âPardon, most holy Father,â quoth Saint Clare, âFor well were I deserving utmost blame, Who but a worthless woman am, should I, In presence of God's Vicar, dare pronounce Such blessing.â And the Pope replied: âThat this Be not imputed to presumptuous thought, But merit of obedience, I command By holy obedience that upon these loaves Thou make the said sign of the holy Cross, And in God's name do bless them.â Thereupon Saint Clare, as daughter of obedience true, Devoutly blessed the loaves, and made withal The sign of the holy Cross. O wondrous thing! Forthwith on all those loaves, right fair inwrought, The sign o' the Cross appeared: then some thereof Were eaten, some, the miracle to mark, Put by. And when the Holy Father saw That miracle, of the said bread he took, And, rendering thanks to God, and from Saint Clare With benediction parting, went his way. At that time in the Convent, with Saint Clare, Her mother Sister Ortolana dwelt, And Sister Agnes, her own sisterâboth Full of good works and of the Holy Ghostâ With many another saintly nun; to whom Saint Francis sent sick persons not a few; And, one and all, with prayers and with the sign O' the Cross they healed them. To Christ's praise. Amen. XXXIII.HOW SAINT LOUIS WENT TO VISIT BROTHER GILES Saint Louis, King of France, from shrine to shrine Went through the world on pilgrimage, and when He heard tell of the passing sanctity Of Brother Giles, the which had been among Saint Francis' first companions, he resolved Wholly, and set his heart to visit him In person. Wherefore to Perugia, Where Brother Giles then sojourned, forth he fared, And, coming to the Brothers' Convent-door As a poor unknown pilgrim, and with few Companions, he inquired right urgently For Brother Giles, nor told the porter aught Of who it was, inquired. The porter went And said to Brother Giles that at the door There was a pilgrim who inquired for him: And lo! it was revealed to him of God In spirit to know it was the King of France: Whereat on a sudden, with great ardour fired, He issued from his cell, and ran to the door: And without further questioning, albeit Ne'er seen of one another, down they knelt In great devotion, and, each clasping each, Kissed as familiarly as they had been Long-linked in utmost friendship: for all that, No word spake one to other, but thus embraced Continued, with these signs of tender love, In silence. And when now for a great space In the said manner they had so remained Without word spoken, they parted each from each, And forth Saint Louis upon his journey fared, And Brother Giles returned him to his cell. And when Saint Louis the King had gone his way, A certain Brother of his companion asked Who it had been that was so long time locked In Brother Giles' embrace: and he replied That it was Louis King of France had come To look on Brother Giles. And when this word He to the others told, sore vexed were they That Brother Giles had said no word to him: And, hereat murmuring, they bespake him thus: âO Brother Giles, why wert thou such a churl As unto king so excellent, who came From France to look on thee, and from thy lips Hear some good word, to say no word at all?â Made answer Brother Giles: âBrothers most dear, Marvel not therefore, since nor I to him, Nor he to me, had power to speak a word; For long as we were thus together clasped, The light of heavenly wisdom revealed plain His heart to me, and mine to him, and so By divine operation gazing thus Each into other's heart, we better knew What I to him, and he to me, would say, Than if by word of mouth we had uttered it, Yea, and with greater solace, than if that, Which in our heart we felt, we had in word Unfolded, through default of human speech Which may not the hid mysteries of God Shew clearly forth, and would have wrought in us Rather discomfort than encouragement. Wherefore with wondrous solace, wot ye well, The king departed.â To Christ's praise. Amen. XXXIV.HOW SAINT CLARE WAS MIRACULOUSLY CARRIED OF ANGELS TO THE CHURCH OF SAINT FRANCIS Saint Clare was on a time so grievous sick That to the church she might by no means win To say the Office with the other Nuns: And when the feast o' the birth of Christ was toward, And all the Sisters else to Matins hied, She remained sole abed, and ill-content That with the rest she might not win to share That ghostly solace. But Jesu Christ, her spouse, Loth that she thus be left disconsolate, Made her miraculously to be borne Of Angels to Saint Francis' church, and there At Matin-Office and at midnight-Mass Be present to the close, and, more than this, Receive the blest Communion, and anon Caused her be carried to her couch again. And when unto Saint Clare the Nuns returned, The Holy Office at Saint Damian's done, They said to her: âO Mother, Sister Clare, What wondrous consolation hath been ours On this, Christ's holy birth-night! Would to God He had vouchsafed thee to be there with us!â Whereto Saint Clare made answer: âPraise and thanks Unto my Lord the blessÃ¨d Jesu Christ, Sisters and Daughters mine most dear, I give, For that with utmost solace to my soul I have had part in each solemnity Of this most holy night, and greater things Than ye had part in, through my Father's aid, Saint Francis, and the grace of God; for I In holy Father Francis' church have been, And with mine own ears, both of body and mind, Have all the singing heard, and eke the sound Of organs therein made, and have myself Received the blest Communion. Then rejoice For this high favour done to me, and give Thanks unto Jesu Christ our Lord.â Amen. XXXV.HOW BROTHER LEO HAD A VISION, WHICH WAS INTERPRETED BY SAINT FRANCIS When as Saint Francis once lay grievous sick, And Brother Leo was serving him, behold! The aforesaid Brother Leo, being at prayer Nigh to Saint Francis, from himself was rapt In Jesu Christ, and borne in spirit away To a mighty river, headlong-swift, and wide. And, standing to behold who passed, he saw Some certain Brothers, with burdens on their backs, Enter that river, the which were suddenly Down-beaten by the force o' the flood, and drowned: Others there were who won a third part o'er, Some e'en to midmost of the stream, and some Well nigh to the other side: who, one and all, Through the flood's force, and bearing on their backs Those burdens, were at last o'er thrown and drowned. And Brother Leo had mighty ruth for them, Beholding: and on a sudden, as he stood thus, Lo! a great multitude of Brothers came, Without one burden or any weight, in whom Shone forth the light of holy poverty. These, entering, without peril passed the flood: And Brother Leo, having all beheld, Came to himself. Saint Francis hereupon Perceiving in spirit that Brother Leo had seen A vision, called him to his side and asked What he had seen: to whom when point by point This Brother Leo had told the vision o'er, Saint Francis said: âThat thou hast seen is true. The mighty river is this world: therewithal The Brothers drowned in the riverâthese are they Their gospel-vows who followed not, in chief As touching deepest poverty: but they, Who without peril crossed, those Brothers are The which no earthly and no carnal thing Sought or possessed in this world, but, of food And raiment having merely the bare mean, Follow Christ naked on the Cross, and are Contented; and the burden and sweet yoke Of Christ and holy obedience these do bear Willing and fain, and from the body's life Win hence an easy passage unto life Eternal.â To the praise of God. Amen. XXXVI.HOW A RICH AND COURTEOUS KNIGHT ENTERTAINED SAINT FRANCIS, AND AFTERWARDS JOINED THE ORDER Saint Francis, thrall of God, coming one eve Late to the house of a great nobleman And mighty, was received and lodged of him, Both he and his companion, as they had been Angels of Paradise, with uttermost Of courtesy and devotion: for which cause Saint Francis mightily set his love upon him, Seeing that as they passed within the house He had embraced them, and full friendly kissed, And then had washed, and wiped, and kissed their feet Humbly, and kindled a great fire, and made Ready the board with divers goodly meats, And with glad countenance, the while he ate, Served them unceasingly. Anon, when now Saint Francis had with his companion supped, Outspake this nobleman: âFather, behold! To you myself I offer, and of mine What things so-e'er ye need; and, need ye ever Tunic, or cloak, or any single thing, Buy it, and I will pay you; and take note That ready am I to furnish all your needs, Since by God's grace I can; for I abound In every earthly blessing; therefore too, For love of God who gave me them, right fain Am I to benefit His poor.â Whereat Saint Francis, seeing his so great courtesy And kindness, and large offerings, did conceive Such love for the man, that, when he parted thence, He strode along, to his companion saying: âThis nobleman would of a surety be Good for our fellowship, who is toward God Of gratitude so mindful, and so kind And courteous to his neighbour and the poor. Know, Brother mine most dear, that courtesy Is of God's attributes, who sun and shower To just and unjust courteously doth give: Yea, courtesy is sister's self indeed To charity, which keepeth love alive, And quencheth hate. And seeing that I have marked In this good man a virtue so divine, Him would I gladly for companion have: I will then we one day return to him, If haply God may touch his heart to wish Go with us in God's service: and meanwhile Pray we that God may plant within his soul The said desire, and give him grace withal To bring it to effect.â O wondrous thing! Within few days after Saint Francis' prayer, Into the heart of the said nobleman God sent the said desire, and therewithal Saint Francis spake to his companion, saying: âHie we, my Brother, to yon courteous man, For certain hope have I in God that he, Being so courteous touching things of time, Will yield himself unto our company.â So forth they went, and to his house drew near. Then to his fellow thus Saint Francis spake: âAbide we here a little, for I would first Pray God to make our journey prosperous, And that this noble prey, the which we think To pluck from the world, poor weaklings that we be, He may vouchsafe to yield us through the worth Of His most holy Passion.â And, this said, He fell to praying in a place from whence By the said courteous man he might be seen. Whereat, as God willed, the said nobleman, Looking to this side and to that, beheld Saint Francis in devoutest prayer to God, Who with a great light, as he prayed, appeared And stood before him; and, God standing thus, He saw Saint Francis a good space from earth Raised bodily; by the which he was so touched, Inspired of God to leave the world behind, That from his palace he straight gat him forth, And to Saint Francis ran in fervour of soul, And coming to him thus in act of prayer Kneeled at his feet, and with great earnestness Prayed him devoutly with himself vouchsafe Receive him to do penance. Whereupon Saint Francis, seeing his prayer was heard of God, And that this nobleman right urgently Asked that himself desired, anon uprose In fervour and joy of spirit, and embraced And kissed him, with devoutest thanks to God, The which had added to his company A Knight so perfect. And this nobleman Said to Saint Francis: âWhat dost bid me do, My Father? here am I at thy behest Ready to give my substance to the poor, And follow Christ with thee, untrammelled thus Of all things earthly.â And e'en so he did; For, by Saint Francis' counsel and command, Distributing all his goods among the poor, He came within the Order, and lived on In utmost penitence, sanctity of life, And holy conversation, and at length Life ended, to the glory of the blest Departed. To the praise of Christ. Amen. XXXVII.HOW IT WAS REVEALED TO SAINT FRANCIS THAT BROTHER ELIAS WAS DAMNED, AND THE SEQUEL THEREOF When as Saint Francis in the self-same House With Brother Elias sojourned on a time, It was of God unto Saint Francis shewn That damned was Brother Elias, and that he Would from the Order fall away, and die At last outside the Order: for which cause Saint Francis such mislike for him conceived, That he nor spake nor talked with him; and, if E'er chanced that Brother Elias toward him drew, He turned aside, and went some other way, Thereby to 'scape the encounter; in such wise That Brother Elias 'gan perceive and know Saint Francis had mislike for him; whereof Wishing to learn the reason, he one day Approached Saint Francis, for to speak with him; And when Saint Francis would have shunned him, he Held him perforce in courteous wise, and 'gan Discreetly pray him to make known the cause Why he so shunned his speech and company. Saint Francis answered him: âThe cause is this, That God hath shewn me how that for thy sins Thou wilt from the Order fall away, and die Outside the Order; this too hath God shewn, That thou art damned.â Made answer, hearing it, Brother Elias: âReverend Father mine, Prithee for God's love shun me not for this, Nor drive me from thee, but as shepherd good And as God's scholar, seek and save the sheep, Which, an thou help not, perisheth; and, if It may be, beseech God for me revoke The doom of my damnation; for one finds It written that God doth let revoke His doom, So mend his sin the sinner: and in thy prayers Such faith is mine, that were I in mid-hell, And thou mad'st prayer to God for me, I should Some comfort feel; wherefore, again I pray, Commend me, sinful as I am, to God, Who came for to save sinners, that He may Receive me to His mercy.â Thus with tears And deep devotion Brother Elias spake: Whereat Saint Francis, with a father's ruth, Promised to pray God for him, and so did. And, full devoutly praying for him to God, He knew by revelation that his prayer Was heard of God, and Brother Elias' doom, As touching his damnation, done away, Nor would his soul be damned at last; nathless That from the Order he full sure would go, And die outside the Order; which so came To pass: for Frederick, King of Sicily, Against the Church rebelling, and of the Pope Being excommunicate, with whosoe'er Had lent him aid or counsel, it befel That the said Brother Elias, who was deemed One of the wisest of earth's folk, at suit O' the said King Frederick, to his party clave, And so became a rebel against the Church, And recreant to his Order; for which cause He by the Pope was excommunicate, And of the habit of Saint Francis reft. And, being thus excommunicate, he fell Sore sick; and a lay Brother, who had stayed Within the Order, and was a man of good And holy conversation, having heard Of the said sickness, came to visit him, And, among other things, bespake him thus: âSorely it grieves me, Brother mine most dear, That thou, being excommunicate and thrust Forth from the Order, in this plight should'st die: But, an some mode or means thou seest, by which To pluck thee from this peril, every toil Will I bear gladly.â Brother Elias said: âNo means see I, my Brother, save this alone, That to the Pope thou hie thee, and for love Of God, and of Saint Francis, thrall of God, By whose admonishment I left the world, Pray him absolve me from the Church's ban, The holy garb restore me.â Willingly The Brother said would he that toil bestow For his salvation, so took leave of him, And hied him to the Holy Father's feet, Praying him humbly grant his Brother grace For God's love and Saint Francis'. And the Pope, As God willed, suffered him return, and eke, If Brother Elias yet alive be found, On his behalf absolve him, and give back The habit. Whereat, right gladly setting forth, To Brother Elias he returned full fast, And living found him, but at point to die, So from the ban absolved, and to the garb Restored him: and, from this life passing forth, Through merit of Saint Francis and his prayers, Wherein of old he had such mighty hope, The soul of Brother Elias earned the wage Of mercy. To the praise of God. Amen. XXXVIII.HOW SAINT ANTHONY OF PADUA SO PREACHED THAT HE SEEMED TO MEN OF DIVERS NATIONS TO BE SPEAKING IN THEIR OWN TONGUE That wondrous vessel of the Holy Ghost, Saint Anthony of Padua, being one Of those disciples and companions erst Called of Saint Francis, whom Saint Francis wont To name his bishop, in the Consistory Once preached before the Pope and Cardinals; In which Consistory were gathered men Of divers nations, to wit, Latins, Greeks, French, Germans, English, Slavs, and other tongues O' the world a many; and, by the Holy Ghost Enkindled, with such subtlety and power, So clearly and devoutly set he forth God's Word, and with such learning, that all they Of the Consistory, though of divers tongues, Distinctly understood him, word by word, As if in their own several tongues he spake. Whereat were all astonied, for seemed to them Here wrought afresh that old-world miracle Of the Apostles on day of Pentecost, Who by the Holy Spirit's power did speak In every tongue: and marvelling they said One to another: âIs not he of Spain, Who preacheth? How then hear we from his lips Of all our lands the language?â And the Pope Likewise in wonder pondering on the depth Of that he spake, said: âVerily this man Is Ark of the Testament, and armoury Of Holy Scripture.â To God's praise. Amen. XXXIX.HOW SAINT ANTHONY OF PADUA PREACHED TO THE FISHES The blessÃ¨d Christ, willing to shew how great The holiness of His most faithful thrall Saint Anthony of Padua, and how His preaching and pure doctrine even of beasts, That lack discourse of reason, might be heard Devoutly, by the fishes did reprove Once among other times the foolishness Of infidels and heretics, as erst In the Old Testament by an ass's mouth The witlessness of Balaam He reproved. Saint Anthony then, being on a time At Rimini, where was a great multitude Of heretics, to the light of the true faith Wishing to lead them, and the way of truth, Preached and disputed with them mightily Of Holy Scripture and the faith of Christ: But they not only heeded not his words, But even, as men stiff-necked and obdurate, Would not so much as hear him. Whence befel By divine inspiration on a day Saint Anthony gat him to a river's mouth Hard by the sea, and there upon the bank Took stand 'twixt sea and river, and in God's name, As doth a preacher, to the fish 'gan speak: âHear ye the word of God, ye fish of sea And river, since unbelieving heretics Will none of it.â Scarce had he spoke the word, When up the sea-bank suddenly came to him So large a multitude of fish, great, small, Or midway-fashioned, that in all that sea, And in that river, was ne'er the like beheld For multitude; and all upreared their heads From out the water, and attentive stayed In utter stillness, tame, and orderly: For first and nearest to the margin stood The lesser fish, then those 'twixt large and small, And hindmost, where more deep the water was, Those that were greater. And when thus the fish Were in due order ranged, Saint Anthony On this wise solemnly 'gan preach to them: âO fish, my brothers, beholden are ye much To render thanks, so far as ye have skill, To our Creator, who hath given to you So noble an element wherein to dwell, That ye have choice of salty wave or sweet, As liketh you; and many a hiding-place To shun the tempest hath He given withal, And a transparent element and clear, And food to live by: courteous and benign Is God your Maker, who created you, And, bidding you increase and multiply, Gave you His blessing: afterward when came The general flood, and all the beasts were dying, You only did God scathless keep. And next, That ye might dart at pleasure to and fro, Fins hath He given you. Unto you the grace By God's command was granted, to preserve The Prophet Jonah, and after the third day To cast him up on shore alive and whole. Ye for your Lord, Christ Jesu, did provide The tribute-money, which He, as a poor man, Had not wherewith to pay. Ye were the food Of Jesu Christ, the eternal King, before He rose, and after, by a wondrous mystery: For all which things beholden are ye much To give God praise and blessing, who on you More than on other creatures hath bestowed His benefits.â At these and the like words And admonitions of Saint Anthony, The fish began to ope their mouths, and bow Their heads down, and with these and other signs Of reverence, to the utmost of their power, Give praise to God. Whereat Saint Anthony, Seeing such reverence by the fishes given To their Creator, God, waxed glad of soul, And in a loud voice said: âBlessÃ¨d be God Eternal, since the fish more honour Him Than human heretics, and better heed Give creatures that lack reason to His word, Than men-folk who believe not.â And the more Saint Anthony did preach, the greater grew The multitude of fishes, and of these None from the place, that he had taken, stirred. Unto this miracle the city-folk 'Gan hie them; and of those who thither drew Were numbered e'en the aforesaid heretics; Who, seeing a miracle so marvellous, Not to be gainsaid, pricked at heart, did all Down-cast them at his feet, to hear the word Spoke by Saint Anthony. And Saint Anthony Touching the Catholic faith 'gan preach to them, And preached so nobly that those heretics He one and all converted, turning them To the true faith of Christ: and all, who erst Were faithful, in great joyfulness abode Solaced, and strengthened in their holy faith. Then, bidding the fish go, Saint Anthony Gave them God's blessing; and all went their way With marvellous signs of gladness, and likewise The people. Afterward Saint Anthony Abode in Rimini for many days, Preaching and reaping of the souls of men Much ghostly harvest. To the praise of Christ. XL.HOW BROTHER SIMON FREED FROM TEMPTATION A CERTAIN NOVICE OF SAN SEVERINO About the time when first the Order sprang, In the lifetime of Saint Francis, it befel There came to the Order an Assisan youth, Hight Brother Simon, the which was of God Adorned and dowered with such surpassing grace And meditative holiness of mind, That his whole life a mirror was indeed Of sanctity, as I have heard from those Who were long with him. Right seldom was he seen Outside his cell, and, if at any time Found with the Brothers, would still speak of God. Ne'er was he schooled in grammar; and nathless His talk of God and eke of prayer to Christ Was so profound and lofty, that his words Seemed supernatural words; whence, having gone Into the wood one eve with Brother James Of Massa for to speak of God, the while In sweetest wise of love divine he spake, They in their parley did out-watch the night; Yet in the morning seemed they to have been No more than time the briefest, as to me The aforesaid Brother James recounted it. Now the said Brother Simon did receive Such joy and sweetness of the Holy Ghost From these divine illuminings of God And rapturous visitations, that full oft, Ware of their coming, he laid him on his bed, Since that sweet calm, the Holy Spirit wrought, Required of him not only rest of soul, But even of body; and in such visitings From heaven he was oft rapt in God, and grew Wholly insensible to things of time. Once therefore, being on this wise rapt in God, And to the world insensible, he burned Inward with love divine, and from without Felt naught with the bodily senses. And hereof A Brother, desiring to have proof, and see If, as it seemed, this were so, went and took A live coal from the hearth, and planted it On his bare foot. And Brother Simon felt Naught, and no mark upon his foot it left, Albeit a great while it had there remained, Till of itself it had consumed itself. Now the said Brother Simon, when at board He sat him down, ere bodily food he took, Took and dispensed food ghostly, holding speech Of God the while. By the which holy talk A youth of San Severino he one time Converted, who in laic life had been A youth most vain and worldly, and by birth Noble, and very delicate of frame. And Brother Simon, taking the said youth Into the Order, did his secular clothes Put by in his own keeping; and this youth Abode with Brother Simon, to be taught By him the Rules' observance. Whereupon The devil, who striveth every good to maim, Upon his back did lay so sharp a goad And fiery-hot temptation of the flesh, That by no means might he withstand the same. Wherefore to Brother Simon straight he went, And said to him: âRestore to me my clothes Which from the world I brought away, since this Fleshly temptation I can bear no more.â And Brother Simon had great ruth for him, And said: âSit here a little, Son, with me,â And 'gan to speak to him of God; and all Temptation left him. Afterward at times, Temptation still returning, he would ask His clothes again, and Brother Simon still Would chase it from him with his talk of God. And, this befalling him full oft, at length Waxed the temptation, and gat mightier grip Far than of old, so that, for naught i' the world Being able to resist the same, he went To Brother Simon, and, befall what might, Demanded of him back his secular clothes, For that by no means could he longer stay. Then Brother Simon, after his old wont, Bade him sit down by him, and talked of God; And in his anguish and distress the youth On Brother Simon's bosom bowed his head. Then Brother Simon, in the tender ruth He had to-him-ward, raised his eyes to heaven, And, as devoutly he prayed God for him, The youth was rapt, and Brother Simon's prayer Answered of God; and, coming to himself, The youth was from that tempting wholly free, As though he had ne'er e'en felt it. So the fire Of that temptation being changed in him To fire of the Holy Spirit, seeing that he Was with that burning coal set side by side, To wit with Brother Simon, he became Wholly enkindled with the love of God And neighbour; insomuch that on a time A malefactor being taken and doomed To have both eyes put out, for pity's sake The said youth boldly to the Governor went, When in full council, and with many tears And devout prayers implored him that one eye Might from himself be drawn, and one alone From the malefactor, so that of the twain He be not reft. Thereat the Governor, Seeing the mighty zeal and charity Of the said Brother, with the Council joined, Did pardon both of them. Upon a day The aforesaid Brother Simon was at prayer Within the wood, and feeling in his soul Great consolation, when a flock of crows 'Gan vex him with their cawings, whereupon In Jesu's name he bade them thence depart, Nor e'er come back again: then the said birds Departed, and no more from that time forth Were seen or heard in all the country round. And the said miracle was plain to all The Ward of Fermo, where was situate That Convent. To the praise of Christ. Amen. XLI.CONCERNING BROTHER CONRAD OF OFFIDA AND OTHERS The Province of Ancona's March of old Was, as with stars the firmament, adorned With holy Brothers, who, like luminaries Of heaven, enkindled and made glorious The Order of Saint Francis and the world By precept and ensample. Among the rest Was Brother Lucido Antico first, In very sooth a light of sanctity, Burning with love divine; whose glorious tongue Taught by the Holy Ghost, gat wondrous fruit Of preaching: and Brother Bentivoglia next, Of San Severino, who was sometime seen By Brother Masseo of Severino raised In air a mighty space, within the wood While praying: through which miracle the said Brother Masseo, then a parish-priest, Was moved to quit his parish, and became A Minor Brother, and of such sanctity That he wrought many miracles, in life And after; and his body at Murro rests. The aforesaid Brother Bentivoglia dwelt At Trave Bonanti on a time, alone, To tend and keep a leper; and having charge From his Superior to part thence and go To another place some fifteen miles away, Loth to forsake that leper, with mighty love Kindled, he took and on his shoulders set And bare him all that journey of fifteen miles 'Twixt dawn and sunrise to the aforesaid place Whereto he had been sent, that is of men Named Monte Saracino: o'er which space, Had he an eagle been, in so small time Have flown he could not: and at so supreme A miracle great wonder and amaze Filled all that country-side. Another yet Was Brother Peter of Monticello, who Was once by Brother Servodeo seen, Him of Urbinoâthen his Guardian I' the old House of Anconaâraised from earth Five or six cubits bodily, and borne To the feet o' the Crucified within the church, Where he was praying. This Brother Peter once Keeping Saint Michael the Archangel's fast With deep devotion, on the fortieth day, Last of that fast, was in the church at prayer, When by a youthful Brother to that end 'Neath the High Altar hiding, for to spy Some token of his sanctity, he was heard With Michael the Archangel communing; And these the words they spake: Saint Michael said: âFaithfully, Peter, hast thou toiled for me, And vexed thy body in many ways: behold! I am come to comfort thee, and eke for this, That thou may'st ask what grace so-e'er thou wilt, The which from God I will obtain for thee.â And Brother Peter answered him and said: âMost holy Prince of the celestial host, Loyalest zealot of God's honour, thou Who art of souls protector pitiful, This is the grace I ask, that thou of God Obtain for me the pardon of my sins.â Replied Saint Michael: âAsk some other grace, Since this shall I obtain full easily:â And Brother Peter asking naught beside, The Archangel ended: âFor the faith devout The which thou hast in me, I will procure The grace thou askest, and much more to boot.â And, done their parley, which full long endured, The Archangel Michael parted from his side, Leaving him comforted exceedingly. Now in this holy Brother Peter's time Lived Brother Conrad of Offida too; And at Ferrano in the selfsame House Dwelling, within Ancona's territory, The aforesaid Brother Conrad went one day Into the wood to meditate on God, And Brother Peter followed secretly Behind him, for to see what should befall: And Brother Conrad 'gan to pray, and full Devoutly, with strong crying, did implore Mary the Virgin of her blessÃ¨d Son To win for him this grace, that he might feel A little of that sweetness which of old Was by Saint Simeon felt upon the day Of purification, when he bare in his arms Christ Jesu, Saviour blest. And, the said prayer Ended, Maid Mary, ever pitiful, Heard him. And lo! the Queen of heaven appeared, Holding her little Son upon her arm, In a great splendour of light, and, drawing near To Brother Conrad, set the blessÃ¨d babe Upon his arm, the which did Him receive With uttermost devoutness, and embraced, And closely clasped, and in his bosom laid, All melted and dissolved in love divine, And solace of the soul ineffable. And when Mary the Virgin went her way From Brother Conrad, Brother Peter hied Back to the House, not to be seen of him. But soon as Brother Conrad gat him home Joyful and gay, said Brother Peter to him: âWhat heavenly great solace hast thou had!â Quoth Brother Conrad: âWhat is that thou say'st, O Brother Peter? how know'st thou of aught That I have had?â and Brother Peter said: âWell know I, well I know, that, with her Son, Mary the Virgin came to visit thee.â Then Brother Conrad, who, being truly meek, Touching God's favours fain would secret be, Prayed him tell no man; and so deep the love Thenceforth between them, that one heart and soul They seemed to share, in everything. One time The aforesaid Brother Conrad in the House At Siruolo by his prayers set free A woman by the devil possessed, and all Night long did pray for her, but, being Seen of her mother, fled away with dawn, That by the people he might not be found And honoured. To the praise of Christ. Amen. XLII.HOW BROTHER CONRAD RECLAIMED A REFRACTORY BROTHER Now Brother Conrad of Offida named, Aforesaid, touching gospel poverty A wondrous zealot of Saint Francis' Rule, Was so devout of life, and before God Of so great merit, that the blessÃ¨d Christ With many miracles did honour him In life and after: whereof one was this: Being to Offida's Convent on a time Come as a guest, the Brothers prayed of him To admonish, for God's love and charity, A youthful Brother in that House, the which Did in such childish and unruly sort So wildly bear him, that of old and young He in that Brotherhood disturbance wrought; While of the sacred office, and what else The Rule prescribed, little or naught recked he. Whence Brother Conrad, with compassion moved For the said youth, and at the Brothers' prayer, Called him apart, and with such fervent love Spake to him in devout admonishment Words so effectual that, God's grace to aid, He of a sudden from a child became Old in his ways, and so obedient, kind, Devout and diligent, peaceable withal And lowly, and for every virtuous thing Eager, that as the whole House was erewhile By him disquieted, so were all men now Cheered and well pleased, and loved him mightily. Now, as God's pleasure was, it came to pass That, after his conversion some few days, Died the said youth, whereat right sorely grieved The Brothers; and a few days after death His spirit to Brother Conrad did appear, As at the altar he devoutly prayed Of the said Convent, and full reverently Saluted him as Father; whereupon Asked Brother Conrad: âWho art thou?â Quoth he: âI am the soul of that young Brother who died Some days agone.â And Brother Conrad said: âO dearest Son, how is it with thee?â And he Replied: âMy dearest Father, by God's grace, And through thy teaching, it is thus far well, That damned I am not; nathless for my sins, The which I had not time to cleanse enow, I suffer shrewdest pains of Purgatory. But prithee, Father, even as in thy ruth Thou succoured'st me, yet living, so too now May it please thee succour me in these my pains, By saying a Paternoster certain times, Since in God's sight right welcome are thy prayers.â Then Brother Conrad kindly to his suit Consenting, having said one Paternoster And Requiem Ã¦ternam, quoth that soul: âO dearest Father, what great good, and what Refreshment do I feel! I pray thee now Say it once more:â and Brother Conrad said it; And after he had said it, quoth the soul: âKnow, holy Father, when thou prayest for me, Allayed is all my suffering; wherefore I Beseech thee cease not thus for me to pray.â Then Brother Conrad, seeing by these his prayers That soul so holpen, said a hundred times The Paternoster for him; and, this done, âI thank thee, dearest Father,â quoth the soul, âIn God's name, for the love which thou hast borne To-me-ward; seeing that through thy prayers from all My pains am I delivered, and go my way To the celestial Kingdom;â and, this said, The soul departed. Then to their great joy Did Brother Conrad cheer the Brothers' hearts, And all in order told that vision o'er. Unto the blessÃ¨d Christ His praise. Amen. XLIII.CONCERNING THE VISION VOUCHSAFED TO BROTHER PETER What time together in Ancona's Ward, Forano's Convent, the said Brothers dwelt, Conrad and Peterâof the March Province Two shining stars that were, two men of heavenâ Seeing that between them was such mighty love And charity, that one single heart, one soul, Seemed in the twain, they bound them by this pact, That every solace by God's grace vouchsafed Each unto other should in love make known: Which pact so made betwixt them, it befel One day that, Brother Peter being at prayer, Devoutly of Christ's Passion pondering, And how the blessÃ¨d Mother of Christ, and John His best-beloved disciple, and withal Saint Francis, were at foot o' the Cross portrayed, Through sorrow of spirit crucified with Christ, There fell a longing on his heart to know Which for Christ's Passion had the mightiest grief Of all those threeâthe Mother who Him bare, Or the disciple on His breast who slept, Or he that had with Christ been crucified, Saint Francis. Thus devoutly pondering, Mary the Virgin to his eyes appeared, And at her side Saint John the Evangelist, And eke Saint Francis, clad in glorious robes Of beatific lustre; but the weed Saint Francis wore seemed fairer than Saint John's. And Brother Peter being sore afeard At the said vision, Saint John heartened him, Saying: âFear not, dear Brother, for we are come To comfort thee, and clear thee of thy doubt. Know therefore that the Mother of Christ and I Beyond all creatures for Christ's Passion grieve, And, after us, Saint Francis more than any, Whom therefore in such glory now thou seest.â And Brother Peter did inquire of him: âMost holy Apostle of Christ, say for what cause The raiment of Saint Francis doth appear More beauteous than thine own.â Replied Saint John: âThis is the reason, that while in the world He viler raiment bare on back than I.â And when these words he had uttered, lo! Saint John To Brother Peter gave a glorious robe, The which in hand he bare, and said to him: âTake thou this robe which I have hither brought To give thee:â and, as in the said robe Saint John Was fain to array him, Brother Peter fell To earth astonied, and 'gan cry aloud: âO Brother Conrad, Brother Conrad dear, Come hither quickly and help me, come and see Things marvellous!â And, as he spake the word, The holy vision vanished. Afterward, When Brother Conrad came, he told him all In order; and they gave thanks to God. Amen. XLIV.OF THE LIFE AND DEATH OF JOHN OF LA PENNA He of La Penna, Brother John, as yet Being a lad and laic, unto him In the March Province did one night appear A marvellous fair boy, who called him, saying: âJohn, hie thee to Saint Stephen's, where doth preach One of my Minor Brothers, and believe His doctrine thou, and to his words give ear, Since I have sent him thither: and, this done, Lo! a long journey thou hast yet to make, And afterward shalt come to me.â Thereat He tarried not an instant, but uprose, And in his spirit felt a mighty change. And, coming to Saint Stephen's, he found there Great multitude of men and women set To hear the preaching. He that was to preach A Brother was named Philip, and one of those First Brethren to Ancona's March who came; And in the March as yet were Houses few. Upstood this Brother Philip then to preach, And full devoutly preached he, not with words Of human wit, but in the power of Christ And of His spirit, heralding the realm Of life eternal. And, the preaching done, To the said Brother Philip the lad went, And said to him: âO Father, an thou list Receive me to the Order, fain would I Do penance, and serve Jesu Christ our Lord.â And Brother Philip, perceiving in the lad A marvellous innocence and ready will To do God service, said: âOn such a day To me at Ricanati shalt thou come, And I will cause receive thee:â for 'twas there The Chapter of the Province should be held: Whereby the lad, who was most pure of heart, Deemed this was that long journey he must make, Even as the vision had foretold to him, And, after, go to Paradise: and thus He thought to do forthwith, when he should be Received into the Order. So he went And was received. And seeing at that time The things he thought fulfilled not, and when now The Minister in Chapter said: âWhoe'er Into the Province of Provence would go Should have free licence,â a great longing fell On him to go there, thinking in his heart That this was that long journey he must make, Before he came to Paradise: but since He shamed to say it, confiding at the last In the aforesaid Philip, who had caused Receive him to the Order, tenderly He prayed the same this grace for him obtainâ Into the Province of Provence to go. Then Brother Philip, seeing his purity And inward purpose, did that grace obtain: Whereat with mighty gladness Brother John Set forth to go, having this thought for sure, That, the said journey ended, he should come To Paradise. But, as God's pleasure was, Within the aforesaid Province he remained In this same expectation and desire Five years and twenty, shewing forth the while A life-ensample of pure holiness, Ever in virtue growing, and in grace With God and with the people, mightily Alike of Brethren and of lay-folk loved. And one day Brother John devoutly praying With tears and lamentations for the hope As yet fulfilled not, and life's pilgrimage Too long continued, to his eyes appeared The Christ, the blessÃ¨d One, at sight of whom His whole soul waxed as water, and anon Christ thus bespake him: âBrother John, my son, Ask that thou wilt of Me:â he answered: âLord, I know not what to ask Thee, save Thyself, Since naught beside do I desire: but this Alone I pray Thee, pardon Thou my sins, And grant me grace to see Thee yet again, Whenas my need is greater.â Said the Christ: âThy prayer is heard,â and, having said, was gone, And Brother John remained with solace filled And heartened. Now the Brethren of the March, Hearing the fame of his great sanctity, Wrought on the General so that to the March He sent him an Obedience to return; Receiving which Obedience he with joy Set forward, thinking that, this journey done, According to the promise of the Christ, He needs must go to heaven. But, having thus Back to the Province of the March returned, For thirty years he lived there, nor was known To any of his kin, and day by day He waited on God's pity to redeem His promise. And meanwhile full many a time Right prudently the Guardianship he held; And God by him wrought many miracles. And, among other gifts he had from God, He had the spirit of prophecy; for onceâ He from the House gone forth upon a timeâ One of his Novices, by the Devil assailed, So sore was tempted, that, at last thereto Consenting, he took counsel with himself, So soon as Brother John should have returned, To quit the Order: which thing Brother John Knowingâboth his temptation and intentâ By spirit of prophecy, anon came home, And summoned the said Novice to himself, And bade him make confession: but, before Confession might be made, he told him all In order his temptation, as by God Revealed to him, and ended thus: âMy son, Since thou did'st wait for me, nor would'st depart Without my benediction, God this grace To thee hath given, that never shalt thou quit This Order, but shalt in the Order die, With grace divine upon thee.â Therewithal Was the said Novice strengthened in goodwill, And stayed within the Order, and became A holy Brother: and these things were all By Brother Ugolino told to me. Now the said Brother John, who was a man Of cheerful and calm mind, and seldom spake, Was to much prayer and deep devotion prone; And, chiefly, after Matins slept he ne'er Nor to his cell returned, but in the church Stayed praying till dawn: and, Matins o'er one night, As he continued praying, appeared to him God's Angel and bespake him: âBrother John, Now is thy journey ended, for the which Thou hast long time been waiting; wherefore I Bring word to thee from God that thou demand What grace thou wilt of Him; and I bring word That thou choose, further, whether of these thou wiltâ One day in Purgatory, or seven days' pain In this world.â And, in this world Brother John Choosing the seven days' pain, anon fell sick Of divers maladies; for fever sore Gat hold of him, and gout in hands and feet, And pain in the side, and many another ill; But what worse tortured him was that a fiend Still stood before him, holding in his hand A mighty scroll, with all the sins inscribed That he had ever wrought, who said to him: âFor these transgressions, or of heart, or tongue, Or else in act accomplished, thou art damned Even to the depths of hell.â And naught of good Could he remember ever done by him, Or in the Order, or when-else-so-e'er, But thought within his heart that he was damned, Even as the fiend had told him. So, when asked By any how he fared, he answered: âIll, For I am damned.â The Brothers, seeing this, Marvelled, and for an agÃ¨d Brother, hight Matthew of Monte Rubbiano, sentâ A holy man, fast friend to Brother John. And the said Brother Matthew, coming thus Upon the seventh day of his distress, Saluted him, and asked him how he fared; And he made answer that he fared but ill, For he was damned. Then Brother Matthew said: âRememberest not how thou hast many a time Confessed to me, and I of all thy sins Have utterly assoiled thee? And again Dost not remember how thou hast served God Within this holy Order year by year Continually? And next rememberest not How that God's mercy doth the whole world's sin Surpass, and that our blessÃ¨d Saviour Christ For our redemption paid a priceless sum? Have then good hope that thou art surely saved.â And with that word, the term of chastening past, Fled the temptation, and the comfort came. And with exceeding joy spake Brother John To Brother Matthew: âSince the hour is late, And thou art weary, prithee go to rest:â And he was loth to leave him, but at length Upon his strong entreaty went to rest, And with the Brother who served him Brother John Remained alone. And lo! the blessÃ¨d Christ Came in transcendent brightness, with a waft Of marvellous sweet odour, even as He Had promised to appear to him again, Whenas his need was greater; and of all His sicknesses He healed him utterly. Then Brother John, with folded hands to God Returning thanks, that with so good an end He the long journey of this woful life Had consummated, to the hands of Christ Resigned his spirit, and gave it back to God, From this life mortal to immortal life Passing with Christ the blessÃ¨d, whom so long He had desired, and waited to behold. And the said Brother John now rests within The Convent of La Penna of Saint John Aforesaid. To the praise of Christ. Amen. XLV.CONCERNING BROTHER HUMBLE AND BROTHER PEACEABLE Within the aforesaid Province of the March, After Saint Francis' death, were brothers twain In the Orderâthe one Brother Humble hight, And the other Brother Peaceableâthe which Were men right holy and perfect; and hereof One, to wit Brother Humble, lodged i' the House Of Soffiano, and there died; the other Dwelt in a Convent far enow from him. Now, as it pleased God, Brother Peaceable, Being one day in a lone place at prayer, Was rapt in ecstasy, and saw the soul Of his brother, Brother Humble, the which then Passed from the body, going straight to heaven, Without or let or hindrance. It befel After long years this Brother Peaceable, Who yet remained, was of the fellowship In the said House of Soffiano made, Wherein his brother had died. About that time, Bruforte's lords requesting, they exchanged The said House for another, whence befel, 'Mong sundry matters else, they bore away The holy Brothers' relics, who had died Within that House; and coming to the grave Of Brother Humble, Brother Peaceable Took his own brother's bones, and in good wine Washed them, and wrapped them in a napkin white And with great reverence and devotion kissed, Weeping; whereat the others marvelled sore, Deeming no good ensample set by him, In that, a man of so great sanctity, With carnal and with worldly love he seemed To mourn his brother, and to his relics shew More worship than to the others, who had been No less than Brother Humble holy of life, And their bones worthy reverence, even as his. Then, knowing the Brothers' ill imaginings, This Brother Peaceable in lowly wise Did satisfy them, saying: âMarvel not Hereof, my dearest Brothers, that I have dore That to my brother's bones which to the rest I did not; seeing that, blessÃ¨d be His name, God knoweth it was no carnal love hereto Constrained me, as ye deem; but this I did For that, from this life when my brother passed, I, in a lone place praying, and far from him, Beheld his soul ascending straight to heaven; And therefore am I certified his bones Are sacred, and should be in Paradise: And, had God granted me such certainty Touching the other Brethren, to their bones I had done the self-same reverence.â For which cause, Seeing his holy and devout intent, The Brothers were right well edified, and gave Praise unto God, who doeth to His saints Such marvels. To the praise of Christ. Amen. XLVI.HOW TO A SICK BROTHER APPEARED MARY THE VIRGIN, AND HEALED HIM In the said House of Soffiano dwelt Of old a Minor Brother, of so great grace And sanctity of life that he appeared Wholly divine, and oft was rapt in God. This Brother being in God once all-absorbed And upward lifted, seeing he had the grace Of contemplation notably, to him Came divers kinds of birds, that tamely perched Upon his head and shoulders, arms and hands, And sang in marvellous wise. He was a man Full solitary, and seldom spake, but, when Questioned of any matter, would reply So graciously and wisely, that he seemed To be an Angel rather than a man; Mighty in prayer and contemplation he, And of the Brothers in high reverence held. This Brother of his virtuous life the course Now ending, as God willed, fell sick to death, So that of food he might no morsel take; And therewithal no medicine of the flesh Would he receive; but all his confidence Was in the blest physician, Jesu Christ, And in His blessÃ¨d Mother, at whose hand By divine goodness he earned grace to be Visited mercifully and consoled. Whence on a time, he lying on his bed With all his heart to death disposing him In uttermost devotion, to his eyes Appeared the blessÃ¨d Mother of Jesu Christ, Mary the Maid, in glory, and with her Of Angels and of holy maids a host Innumerable and girt with marvellous light Who to his bed drew nigh: and, seeing her, He took exceeding comfort and good cheer Of soul alike and body, and 'gan to pray Humbly that she would her belovÃ¨d Son Beseech of His own merits to draw him forth From out this prison-house of wretched flesh: Continuing in which prayer with many tears To him made answer calling him by name Mary the Virgin, saying: âDoubt not, my son, For this thy prayer is heard, and I am come To comfort thee a little, ere thou depart From this life.â At the Virgin's side there stood Three holy virgins, the which bare in hand Three boxes of electuary, whose breath Was passing sweet and fragrant. Thereupon Mary the glorious Virgin took and oped One of those boxes, so that all the house Was with the odour filled; and, with a spoon Taking of that electuary, she gave To the sick man thereof; the which so soon As the sick man had tasted, he 'gan feel Such comfort and such sweetness, that it seemed His soul within the body might not stay; Whence he began in such-like words to speak: âNo more, O sweetest Mother of Jesu Christ, Maid Mary blest, healer of human kind! No more, blest mediciner, no more! since I Such sweetness can sustain not.â But the mild And pitying Mother with that electuary Served the sick man again and yet again, Making him take it, till the box was void. Then, void the first box, Mary Virgin blest Taking the second box thrust in the spoon To serve him with it, whereat he gently plained: âMother of God most beauteous, if my soul Is, as it were, all molten by the breath And sweetness of the first electuary, How shall I bear the second? BlessÃ¨d one, By all the saints and angels I thee pray Vouchsafe no more to give me.â Answer made Our Lady: âOf this second box, my son, Taste yet a little.â And, giving him thereof, âTo-day, my son, thou hast received,â she said, âAs much as may suffice thee: O my son, Be comforted, since I will come for thee Ere long, and bring thee to my own Son's realm, Whom still thou'st sought and longed for;â and, this said, Taking her leave of him, she went her way; And he remained so heartened and consoled By that confection's sweetness, that he lived Many days yet sustained and strong, though void Of bodily food. And after certain days, As with the Brothers joyfully he spake, With great delight and gladness from this life His soul departed. To the praise of God. XLVII.HOW A CERTAIN BROTHER WAS ENTRANCED FOR THREE DAYS, AND SAW A VISION OF WHAT SHOULD AFTERWARD BEFALL THE RULE OF SAINT FRANCIS Now Brother James of Massa, to whom God Opened the door of His hid mysteries, And gave him perfectly of Holy Writ And of things future to discern and know, Was of such sanctity, that Brother Giles Of Assisi, of Montino Brother Mark, And Brothers Juniper and Lucido, Said touching him that greater before God None in the world they knew. This Brother James Myself had great desire to see; for when Of Brother Giles' companion, Brother John, I made request he would expound to me Certain things spiritual, he answered thus: âWould'st thou be taught the Spirit's way, seek speech With Brother James of Massa, for by him E'en Brother Giles desired to be illumed, And from his words may naught be ta'en away, Nor thereto added; seeing his mind hath probed The hidden things of heaven, and his words are The words of the Holy Spirit, and there lives None upon earth whom I so much desired To look upon, as the said Brother James.â He, at the outset of the ministry Of Brother John, when praying once at Prime, Was rapt in God, and for three days remained In the said trance and ecstacy, the while All bodily sense suspended, he so void Of sense continued, that the Brotherhood Doubted if he were dead: and in that trance Was shewn to him of God what things should be And come to pass touching our holy Rule. Which when I heard, the greater in me grew My strong desire to see and speak with him. And when God willed that my occasion came To speak with him, I prayed him on this wise: âIf that be true which I have heard of thee, Hold it not hid, I pray thee. I have heard, What time thou didst remain three days as dead, That, among other things, God shewed to thee That which in this our Rule should come to pass; And Brother Matthew, Minister of the March, Gave me to know hereof, to whom thyself Under obedience did'st declare the same.â Then Brother James in deep humility Confessed that Brother Matthew's words were true: Which wordsâto wit what Brother Matthew said, The Minister of the Marchâwere like to these: âI know a brother, to whom God hath revealed All that within our Rule shall come to pass; For Brother James of Massa did unfold In words to me, that, after many things Touching the state of the Church Militant Shewn him of God, he saw in vision a tree Fair and full large, whereof the root was gold, Whose fruits were men, and Minor Brothers, all, And the main boughs in number ranged to match The Provinces of the Order; and each bough The selfsame tale of Brothers did contain, As did the Province by that bough designed. He then of all the Brothers in the Rule, As of each several Province, knew the sum, And eke the names, the ages, and the states, With their great offices and dignities, Yea, and the graces and the faults of all. And Brother John of Parma he beheld Upon the summit of the midmost bough Of the said tree; and on the branches' tops, That were around the midmost bough, were set The Ministers of all the Provinces. And, after this, Christ seated on a throne, Vast and of dazzling whiteness, he beheld; And, calling to Saint Francis, the said Christ Gave him a chalice full of life, and said, As in his hand he placed it: âGet thee hence, Seek out thy Brothers, and give to them this cup Of the spirit of life to drink of, for behold! The spirit of Satan shall against them rise, And strike full sore, and many of them shall fall, Nor rise again.â And for companions, Christ Unto Saint Francis did two Angels give. Then came Saint Francis forth, the cup of life To proffer to his Brothers; and first of all To Brother John he proffered it, the which Took and in haste devoutly drained it dry; And suddenly all luminous as the sun Became he. And Saint Francis, after him, To all the rest in order proffered it. Then were there of them who with reverence due Devoutly took and drained it, and anon Waxed as the sun resplendent. Those again Who spilled it all, nor with devotion took, Became black, dull, misshapen, horrible To gaze on: who part drank thereof, part spilled, Waxed partly luminous, and partly dark, And more or less in measure as they drank Or spilled it. But outsplendouring all the rest Was the aforesaid Brother John, the which More utterly the cup of life had drained, Whereby completely had he scanned the abyss Of infinite light divine, and had therein The tempest of adversity discerned, Which was to rise against that tree, and shake And sway the boughs thereof. For the which cause The aforesaid Brother John from the branch-top, Whereon he stood, came down, 'neath all the boughs Descending, in the solid tree-root hid, And there abode full pensive. Whereupon Went Brother Bonaventura, who had ta'en Part of the cup, part spilling, and up-clomb Into that bough and place whence Brother John Had late departed. And, as there he stood, His finger-nails were turned to nails of iron, Cutting and keen as razors: whereupon He gat him from the place whereto he had climbed, And would have hurled him upon Brother John With force and fury, for to do him hurt. But Brother John, perceiving it, cried out Commending him to Christ, who on the throne Was sitting; and when Christ heard the cry, He called Saint Francis, gave to him a flint-stone keen, And said: âGo, with this stone he off the nails Of Brother Bonaventura, wherewithal He would rend Brother John, that so he have No power to hurt him.â Then Saint Francis came, And did as Christ commanded: the which done, There came a storm of wind, and smote the tree So sorely, that the Brothers fell to earth; And first fell they who all the cup had spilled Of the spirit of life, and were by demons borne To a dark place of pain. But Brother John, With all those others who had drained the cup, Was borne of Angels to a place of life, And light eterne, and splendour of the blest. And the said Brother James, the which had seen The vision, singly and distinctly knew, Discussing clearly, all that he had seen Touching the name and state and rank of each. And so long dured that storm against the tree, That down it fell, and the wind bore it thence. And afterward, soon as the storm had ceased, Straight from this golden tree-root up there sprang Another tree all golden, which brought forth Leaves, flowers, and fruits, of gold. And of this treeâ Its spreading breadth and depth, beauty and worthâ Now to hold silence, rather than to speak, Were better.â To the praise of Christ. Amen. XLVIII.HOW CHRIST APPEARED TO BROTHER JOHN OF VERNIA WHILE SAYING MASS Among the other wise and holy Sons And Brothers of Saint FrancisâSons that are Their father's glory, as saith Solomonâ Lived in our time within the March Province The venerable and holy Brother John Of Fermo, who, long time as he abode In the holy House of Vernia, where he passed From this life, was called simply Brother John Of Vernia: for he was indeed a man Of matchless life, and utmost sanctity. This Brother John, while yet a lad and laic, With all his heart the way of penitence, That keepeth purity of body and soul, Desired, and hence, though quite a little lad, 'Gan shirt of mail and iron girdle wear, And do great abstinence; and above all When with the Canons of Saint Peter's Church Of Fermo, who a life of splendour lived, He sojourned, would shun bodily delights, And starve the flesh with rigorous abstinence; But, having comrades sore opposed thereto, The which did spoil him of his shirt of mail, And baulked his abstinence in divers wise, By God inspired, he thought to leave the world, With all who loved it, and present himself Whole to His arms Who hangs upon the Cross, And in the habit of the crucified Saint Francis; and so did he. Being, then, Received in the Order, thus a little lad, And to the Novice-master's care consigned, So spiritual and devout he grew, that oft, Hearing his master speak of God, his heart Would in him melt, as wax before the fire; And to such sweetness, through this love divine, Of grace was he enkindled, that, to bide Still and sustain such sweetness past his power, He gat him up, and, as one drunken in soul, Now to and fro the garden, now the wood, Now through the church would run, where'er the fire And force of the spirit drave him. Then, as time Sped onward in its course, the grace of God Made ever this angelic man to grow From virtue unto virtue, and in gifts Of heaven, and holy liftings of the soul, And raptures; that at times his mind was borne Up to the splendours of the Cherubim, Or to seraphic ardours, or the joys Of blessÃ¨d spirits, and at other time To passionate-fond embracings of the Christ, Not inward only felt in thrills of soul, But eke by clear signs bodily from without; And above all one time in marvellous wise Kindled his heart the flame of love divine, So that for three full years that flame endured; In the which time he wondrously received Divine consolings and enlightenments, With inward contemplations, ecstacies, And visitings from heaven, and many a time Was rapt in God; and, in a word, throughout Those years aforesaid all on fire he seemed, Burning with love of Christ; and this befel On the holy mount of Vernia. And since God for His children hath peculiar careâ Dispensing to them at their several times Now solace, and now dole, now prosperous hap, Now adverse, as He seeth that they have need, For to sustain them in humility, Or kindle them the more to fond desire Of heavenly thingsâafter three years it pleased God's goodness from the aforesaid Brother John To filch that joy and flame of love divine, And pluck from him all solace of the soul: Whereat without light Brother John remained, And without love of God, all comfortless, Downcast and woebegone. For which thing's sake Thus full of anguish through the wood he went Hither and thither with cries, tears, and sighs, Calling on his belov'd, his spirit's spouse, Who had so hidden Himself, and gone from him; Without whose presence nor repose nor rest Could his soul compass: in no place nathless Could he by any means sweet Jesu find, Nor to those rapturous spirit-thrills of love For Christ restore him, as he wont to do. And many days this trouble stayed by him, The while in ceaseless tears and sighs he still PersÃ©vered, praying that of His pity God Would give him back his soul's belovÃ¨d spouse. At last when, as God willed, He had enow His patience proved, and kindled his desire, One day, as Brother John through the said wood Was pacing, thus afflicted and distressed, In very weariness he sat him down, Against a beech-tree leaning, and remained With face all bathed in tears, and gazing up To heaven. And suddenly behold! appeared Jesu the Christ beside him in the path Whence Brother John had come; but naught He spake. And Brother John, beholding, recognised The Christ, and cast him suddenly at His feet, And with unmeasured tears in humblest wise Besought Him, saying: âLord, help me, seeing that I Without Thee, Saviour, do in darkness dwell And grief; most tender Angel, without Thee In grief I dwell and anguish; without Thee, Son of the most high God, I stand ashamed, Confounded; without Thee bereft am I Of every blessing, and as one struck blind, Since thou art Jesu, very light of souls; Without Thee I am lost and damned, since Thou Art life of souls, yea, of all lives the life; Without Thee barren I am and dry, since Thou Art source of every gift and every grace; Without Thee I am all disconsolate, Since Thou art Jesu, our redemption, love, Desireâthat comfortable bread and wine Which cheers the hearts of Angels and all Saints: Illumine me, most gracious Master mine, Most pitiful Shepherd, for Thy sheep am I, Albeit unworthy.â But whereas the fond Desire of holy men, which God delays To answer, kindleth them to mightier love And merit, Christ the blessÃ¨d went His way Nor heeding him, nor speaking, and so passed Adown the aforesaid path. Then Brother John Rose and ran after, fell at His feet once more, And with a holy importunity Stayed and besought Him, with devout tears saying: âO most sweet Jesu, pity my distress; In the multitude of Thy mercy, by the truth Of Thy salvation, hear and heed my cry; Restore to me the gladness of Thy face And pitiful regard, since all the earth O'erfloweth with Thy mercy.â And again Christ turned from him, and answered not a word, Nor gave him any comfort, but instead Dealt with him as a mother with her child, Who maketh him desire the breast and run Behind her weeping, that thereafter he May be more fain to take it. Brother John Thereat with mightier ardour and desire Followed the Christ; and, coming up with Him, The blessÃ¨d Christ toward him turned, and looked With glad regard and gracious, and therewith, Opening His merciful most holy arms, Clasped him with utmost sweetness; and, as thus His arms He widely opened, Brother John Saw issuing from the Saviour's sacred breast Such rays of marvellous light, as all the wood And his own soul and body did illume. Then Brother John fell at the feet of Christ; And blessÃ¨d Jesu gave him graciously, As erst the Magdalen, His foot to kiss; And Brother John with deepest reverence Took and with tears so bathed it, that he seemed A second Magdalen, devoutly saying: âI pray Thee, Lord, upon my trespasses Look not, but for Thy sacred passion's sake, And by the sprinkling of Thy precious blood, With Thy love's grace reanimate my heart, Seeing that this is Thy command, that Thee With all our heart and all our soul we love, The which commandment may no man fulfil, Save only with Thine aid: O aid me then Thou best-belovÃ¨d Son of God, with all My heart to love Thee, and with all my strength.â And thus as at the feet of Jesu Christ Spake Brother John, his prayer was heard of Him, And he received the former grace, to wit, The flame of love divine, and felt himself Wholly renewed and comforted; and, knowing The gift of divine grace restored to him, He 'gan give thanks unto the blessÃ¨d Christ, And kiss His feet; and afterward, whenas He rose to gaze upon the Saviour's face, Christ proffered and outstretched His sacred hands, That he might kiss them: and when Brother John Had kissed them, he drew nearer and pressed close To Jesu's bosom, and embraced and kissed His ever sacred breast, and Christ embraced And kissed him. And in this embrace and kiss Such divine fragrance Brother John perceived, That, had all spices in the world, all things Of odorous breath, been gathered into one, Beside that perfume they had noisome seemed. And Brother John all ravished was thereby, And soothed, and lightened; and for many months Did that sweet savour in his soul remain. And from his lips, at heavenly wisdom's fount Thus watered from the Saviour's sacred breast, Thenceforth words issued wondrous and divine, Which changed their hearts who heard him, and brought forth Much fruit of souls. And in the woodland path, Whereon the blessÃ¨d feet of Christ had stood, And a good space around it, Brother John Perceived the fragrance and the splendour still, Long after, oft as thitherward he went. And Brother John returning to himself After this ecstacy, when lost to sight Christ's bodily presence, so from the abyss Of His divinity remained in soul Illumined, that, albeit of human lore Unlearn'd, nathless he marvellously solved And cleared the subtlest questions and profound Of the Holy Trinity, and deep mysteries Hid in the sacred Scriptures. And full oft, Whenas before the Pope and Cardinals, Before the King and barons, he discoursedâ Masters and doctorsâthey were all amazed At the deep thoughts and lofty words he spake. Unto the praise of Jesu Christ. Amen. XLIX.HOW BROTHER JOHN, SAYING MASS FOR THE DEAD, SAW MANY SOULS SET FREE FROM PURGATORY Once on the morrow of All Hallows day, When the said Brother John was saying Mass For all the souls o' the dead, as Holy Church Ordaineth, with such potency of love, And such compassionate ruth, that sacrament Sublime he offered, which for efficacy, Beyond all else that can be wrought for them, The souls o' the dead desire, that he appeared All melted by the sweetness of his ruth And love fraternal. Wherefore in that Mass, As he devoutly raised the Body of Christ, And unto God the Father offered itâ For love of Jesu Christ His blessÃ¨d Son, Who to redeem souls hung upon the Cross, Praying Him out of Purgatory-pains Vouchsafe set free the souls o' the dead, by Him Created and redeemedâsudden he saw As 'twere an endless multitude of souls Come forth from Purgatory, as countless sparks Fly from a furnace-fire, and saw them mount To heaven by merit of Christ's Passion, who For quick and dead is offered day by day In that most sacred Host, worthy to be For ever and ever worshippÃ¨d. Amen. L.HOW BROTHER JAMES OF FALLERONE APPEARED AFTER DEATH TO BROTHER JOHN OF VERNIA It chanced upon the time when Brother James Of Fallerone, a right holy man, In Mogliano's Convent lay sore sick, Which is in Fermo's Ward, that Brother John Of Vernia, as aforesaid, dwelling then I' the House of Massa, of his sickness heard, And, since he loved him as his own dear sire, Fell straight to prayer for him, beseeching God Devoutly in the orisons of his mind To the said Brother James He would restore Soundness of body, if that might serve his soul. And while thus praying devoutly, he was rapt Into a trance, and saw a mighty host In the air of many Angels and of Saints Standing above the cell of Brother James, That was within the wood, so dazzling bright, That all the country round was lit thereby. And 'mid these Angels he saw Brother James, The sick man whom he prayed for, in white robes Resplendent: and among them therewithal Saint Francis, holy Father, he beheld Decked with the sacred Stigmata of Christ, And with great glory. And the saintly form Of Brother Lucido he saw and knew, And Brother Matthew of Rubbiano's mount, And Brethren more beside, ne'er seen of him Or known in this life. And as Brother John Was gazing on this blessÃ¨d company With great delight, it was revealed to him That of a surety this sick Brother's soul Was saved, and of that sickness he would die, But that, e'en so, he would not after death Pass instantly to Paradise, but must In Purgatory awhile be purified. Upon this revelation Brother John Felt at the saving of his soul such joy, That for the body's death he grieved no whit, And in the rapture of his heart exclaimed Within himself, and said: âO Brother James, Sweet Father! Brother James, my Brother sweet! O Brother James, most faithful thrall of God! Companion of the Angels, Brother James, And compeer of the blessÃ¨d!â And amid This joy and surety to himself he came, And the same instant gat him from the House, And went to visit the said Brother James At Mogliano, and, there finding him So sorely burdened that he scarce could speak, Foretold to him his body's death, and eke The saving and the glory of his soul, According to the certainty he had, By divine revelation: whereupon, Waxed glad in soul and countenance, Brother James Received him with great joy and merry laugh, And, rendering thanks for the good news he bare, Devoutly did commend himself to him. Then Brother John besought him tenderly That after death he would vouchsafe return, And tell him of his state: and Brother James Gave him his promise, an God willed it so. And, these words spoken, when the hour drew nigh For his departure, Brother James 'gan say That verse o' the Psalm: âI will lie down in peace, And in eternal life will take my rest:â And, this verse said, with blithe and happy face He passed from this life. Afterward, when now He had been buried, Brother John returned Unto the House of Massa, and therein Looked for the promise Brother James had given That on the appointed day he would return. But the said day, as he was praying, Christ With a great company appeared to him Of Angels and of Saints, and Brother James Was not among them. Wherefore Brother John Much marvelling commended him to Christ Devoutly. Afterward, the following day, As Brother John was in the wood at prayer, Lo! companied with Angels, Brother James Appeared to him, all glorious and glad: And Brother John bespake him: âFather, why Upon the promised day return'dst thou not?â Made answer Brother James: âFor that some need I had of purifying; but in that hour When Christ appeared to thee, and thou there-with Commendedst me to Him, Christ heard thy prayer, And from all pain released me; thereupon To Brother James of Massa I appeared; And that devout lay-Brother, who the Mass Was serving, saw the consecrated Host, In act of elevation by the priest, Changed and transformed to a fair living Child; And I bespake him: âWith this Child to-day Of life eternal to the realm I go, The which can no man enter without Him.ââ And, these words spoken, Brother James was gone, Passing with all that blissful company Of Angels into heaven; and Brother John Remained much solaced. The said Brother James Of Fallerone on the Vigil died Of holy James the Apostle, in the month July, and in the aforesaid monastery Of Mogliano; where the grace of God After his death, and for his merit's sake, Wrought wonders. To the praise of Christ. Amen. LI.HOW BROTHER JOHN OF VERNIA HAD A VISION IN WHICH WERE REVEALED TO HIM THE HIDDEN MYSTERIES OF GOD Now seeing that Brother John of Vernia Aforesaid had effectually foregone All worldly solace and delights of time, His whole delight, and his whole hope, on God Reposing, therefore were vouchsafed to him Of divine Goodness wondrous comfortings And revelations, and in special wise Upon the feast of Christ; whence on a time, The season of Christ's birth now drawing nigh, Wherein from Jesu's sweet humanity He looked sure solace to receive of God, The Holy Spirit in his soul did plant Such masterful exuberance of love And fervour for the charity of Christ, In that He did abase Himself to take Our flesh upon Him, that in very sooth His soul did seem drawn from the body forth, And burning like a furnace: the which fire Unable to sustain, with anguish wrung, He, all his being molten, cried aloud, Since through the Holy Spirit's fierce assault, And the surpassing fervour of his love, He could not hold from crying. And at that hour, Wherein this boundless fervour came to him, Came therewithal the hope so sure and strong Of his salvation, that for naught i' the world Believed he, should death fall upon him then, He needs must pass to Purgatory; and this For half a year endured, albeit not thus Continually that wild excess he felt Of fervour; but at certain times o' the day It came to him: and then and afterward Received he visitations from on high, And comforts marvellous and manifold, And many a time was rapt in God, as saw That Brother, who from the first these matters wrote. Among which times he was one night so raised And rapt in God, that he beheld in Himâ In their Creatorâall created things That are in heaven and earth, and, each by each, All their perfections, orders, and degrees. And then discerned he clear how everything Created its Creator doth display, And how God is above, within, without, Beside, all things created. Therewithal Three Persons in one God he skilled to know, And one God in three Persons, and the love How infinite which made the Son of God Take flesh, obedient to the Father's will. And lastly in that vision he perceived How that none other way there was whereby The soul might come to God, and compass life Eternal, save through Christ, the blessÃ¨d One, Who is the Way, the Truth, the Life o' the soul. Amen. LII.HOW BROTHER JOHN OF VERNIA WAS ENTRANCED WHILE SAYING MASS To the said Brother John within the House Of Mogliano aforesaid, as relate The Brothers who were present, once befel This marvellous hap, to wit that the first night After Saint Lawrence' Octave, and within Our Lady's Octave of the Assumption-Feast, When with the other Brethren he had said Matins in church, and on him unawares The unction 'gan of heavenly grace descend, He gat him to the garden, there to brood Upon Christ's Passion, and dispose himself With his whole soul to celebrate the Mass Which on that morn it was his lot to chant. And as he brooded on those words that are The consecration of the Body of Christâ The âHoc est Corpus Meumââpondering Christ's boundless love, whereby it pleasÃ¨d Him Not only with His precious blood redeem, But eke bequeath us for our spirit's food His body and blood most worshipful, the love Of the sweet Jesu 'gan so grow in him To warmth and rapture, that his soul no more Could bear such sweetness; but he cried aloud As drunken in spirit, and ceased not to himself Repeating: âHoc est Corpus Meum;â since So saying, he seemed to see the blessÃ¨d Christ, With the Maid Mary and a multitude Of Angels, and, so saying, was illumed In all the mysteries profound and high Of that exalted Sacrament. And when Dawn now appeared, he passed into the church In that soul-fervour, that solicitude, That utterance on his lips, and thinking not That he was seen or heard of any man; Nathless within the Choir there was at prayer A certain Brother who saw and heard it all. And in this fervour, through the overflow Of heavenly grace unable to refrain, With a loud voice he cried, continuing thus Until the hour of Mass, whenas he turned To make him ready, and to the Altar went. And, Mass begun, the further in that Mass He fared, the greater grew his love for Christ, And fervour of devotion; and therewith Was given a sense of God unspeakable, The which himself conceived not, nor with tongue Could utter. And fearing lest this sense of God And the said fervour should so wax in strength That he must leave the Mass, he fell in great Perplexity, nor wist what course to takeâ Or to proceed, or tarry. And since the like Had erst at times befallen him, and the Lord That fervour had so tempered, that to leave The Mass he had needed not, so trusted he Now for like power, and with great fear began Go forward with the Mass, and came at length To the Preface of Our Lady, when so waxed Within him the divine illumining And gracious sweetness of the love of God, That coming to the words âQui pridie,â Such rapturous sweetness he could scarce endure. At last, in act to consecrate, and o'er The Host now saying the consecrative words, When half the words, to wit âHoc est,â were said, By no means further might he win, but stood These words âHoc estâ repeating, and no more. And why he might not further win was this, For that Christ's presence he both felt and saw Girt with an angel-host, whose majesty Sustain he could not: and he saw that Christ Would enter not the Host, or that the Host Would change not to the Body of Christ, if he Not uttered of those words the second half, To wit, the âCorpus Meum.â Whereupon, While he remained in this solicitude, And could no further go, the guardians And other brethren, with lay-folk beside A many, that were in church to hear the Mass, Drew nigh the altar, and beheld amazed The acts of Brother John; and many of them Wept for devotion. After a long while When, as God willed it, Brother John pronounced With loud voice âCorpus Meum,â suddenly Vanished the form of bread within the Host, And Jesu Christ, the blessÃ¨d One, appeared Incarnate, glorified, revealing plain The meekness and the love which made Him take Flesh of the Virgin Mary, and maketh Him Into the priest's hands day by day to pass, Whenas the Host he consecrates: whereby He was yet more in sweetness upward borne Of contemplation. Wherefore when he now Had raised the Host on high, and therewithal The cup had consecrated, he was rapt From his own self, and, being from bodily sense In soul suspended, back his body fell; And, save that by the guardian he was held, Who stood behind him, he had fallen to earth. Whereat the Brothers who were in the church, And lay-folk, men and women, running up Together, he was carried as one dead Into the sacristy; for cold his form And corpse-like; and the fingers of his hands Were clenched so firm that scarce could they unclasp Or stir them. Thus as one half-dead he lay, Or rapt, till Tierce; and it was summer-time. And seeing that I, who was there present, yearned Exceedingly to know how God had wrought Toward him, soon as to himself he came, I went and prayed him for the love of God To tell me the whole matter: wherefore he, Since well he trusted me, told all the tale In order; saying among other things That as he pondered on the body and blood Of Jesu Christ, and also therebefore, The blood within him had dissolved like wax Much molten, and his flesh all boneless seemed, So that he could not lift or hand or arm, To make the sign o' the Cross above the Host Or chalice; and he told me this beside, That ere he was made priest, it was of God Revealed to him that he would swoon in Mass, But, for that many Masses he had said, And this had ne'er befallen him, he deemed The revelation had not been of God: Nathless, that haply fifty days before The Assumption of Our Lady, during which The aforesaid hap befel him, 'twas again Revealed to him of God, that this would fall About the time of the Assumption-feast, But that he afterward remembered not The revelation. To Christ's praise. Amen.</field>
