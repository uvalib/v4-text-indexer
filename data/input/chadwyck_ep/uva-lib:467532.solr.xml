Michele; Noble. Battista; Noble. Ezril; a Jew. Melchior. Valeria; Varini's daughter and Orazio's wife. Armida. Rosaura. A Female Attendant. Gentlemen, ladies, guards, and attendants. Scene, Ferrara. ACT I. Scene I. A street in Ferrara. Michele and Battista meeting: Marcello at the side. Michele. Fair shine this evening's stars upon your pleasures, Battista Sorbi! Batt. Sir, well met to-night: Methinks our path is one. Mich. And all Ferrara's. There's not a candle lit to-night at home; And for the cups,—they'll be less wet with wine Than is the inmost grain of all this earth With the now-falling dew. None sit in doors, Except the babe, and his forgotten grandsire, And such as, out of life, each side do lie Against the shutter of the grave or womb. The rest that build up the great hill of life, From the crutch-riding boy to his sweet mother, The deer-eyed girl, and the brown fellow of war, To the grey head and grandest sire of all That's half in heaven,—all these are forth to-night; And there they throng upon both sides the river, Which, guessing at its hidden banks, flows on, A water-stream betwixt two tides of flesh:— And still the streets pour on. Batt. And where go they? To the feast, the wine, the lady-footed dance— Where you, and I, and every citizen That has a feathered and a jewelled cap, And youthful curls to hang beside it brownly,— To the Duke's brother, Lord Orazio's palace. Marc. (aside). Orazio! what of him? Mich. Ay, that's a man After the heart of Bacchus! By my life, There is no mortal stuff, that foots the earth, Able to wear the shape of man, like him, And fill it with the carriage of a god. We're but the tools and scaffolding of men, The lines, the sketch, and he the very thing: And, if we share the name of manhood with him, Thus in the woods the tattered, wool-hung briar, And the base, bowing poplar, the winds' slave, Are trees,—and so's the great and kingly oak, Within whose branches, like a soul, does dwell The sun's bold eagle:—as the villain fox, The weazel, and the sneaking cur are beasts,— While he, whose wine is in a giant's heart, The royal lion has no bigger name. Let men be trees, why then he is the oak; Let men be beasts, he is their lion-master; Let them be stars, and then he is a sun, A sun whose beams are gold, the night his noon, His summer-field a marble hall of banquets, With jasper, onyx, amber-leaved cups On golden straws for flowers, and, for the dew, Wine of the richest grape. So let's not talk And breathe away the time, whose sands are thawed Into such purple tears, but drink it off. Batt. Why then, away! let's fit our velvet arms, And on together.— Marc. (advancing.) Nobles of Ferrara, My gentle lords, have pity for a man, Whom fortune and the roundness of the world Have, from his feeble footing on its top, Flung to deep poverty. When I was born, They hid my helplessness in purple wraps, And cradled me within a jewelled crown. But now—O bitter now!—what name of woe, Beyond the knowledge of the lips of hell, Is fitted to my poor and withering soul, And its old, wretched dwelling? Batt. What is this? Methinks that a præ-adamite skeleton, Burst from the grave in a stolen cloak of flesh, Ragged and threadbare, from a witch's back, Who lived an hundred years, would scarcely seem More miserably old. Mich. A wandering beggar, Come to Ferrara with the daily lie, That bears him bread. Come on, and heed him not. The stocks, old sir, grow in our streets. Enter a Gentleman. How now? What's your news, sir? Gent. He's coming through this street, Orazio, wrapt, like Bacchus, in the hide Of a specked panther, with his dancing nymphs, And torches bright and many, as his slaves Had gathered up the fragments of the sun That fell just now. Hark! here his music comes. (Enter Orazio, between Armida and Rosaura, attended.) Oraz. Thrice to the moon, and thrice unto the sun, And thrice unto the lesser stars of night, From tower and hill, by trump and cannon's voice, Have I proclaimed myself a deity's son: Not Alexander's father, Ammon old, But ivied Bacchus, do I call my sire. Hymn it once more. Song. Strew not earth with empty stars, Strew it not with roses, Nor feathers from the crest of Mars, Nor summer's idle posies. 'Tis not the primrose-sandalled moon, Nor cold and silent morn, Nor he that climbs the dusty noon, Nor mower war with scythe that drops, Stuck with helmed and turbaned tops Of enemies new shorn. Ye cups, ye lyres, ye trumpets know, Pour your music, let it flow, 'Tis Bacchus' son who walks below. Oraz. Now break that kiss, and answer me, my Hebe; Has our great sire a planet in the sky,— One of these lights? Rosau. Not yet, I think, my lord. Oraz. My lord? my love! I am the Lord of Love; So call me by my dukedom.—He has not? We'll make him one, my nymph: when those bright eyes Are closed, and that they shall not be, I swear, 'Till I have loved them many thousand hours,— But when they are, their blue enchanted fire Cupid shall take upon a torch of heaven, And light the woody sides of some dim world, Which shall be Bacchus' godson-star. Rosau. Alas! Their fire is but unsteady, weak, and watery, To guess by your love's wavering. Oraz. Wine in a ruby! I'll solemnize their beauty in a draught, Pressed from the summer of an hundred vines. Look on't, my sweet. Rosaura, this same night I will immortalize those lips of thine, That make a kiss so spicy. Touch the cup: Ruby to ruby! Slave, let it be thrown, At midnight, from a boat into mid-sea: Rosaura's kiss shall rest unravished there, While sea and land lie in each other's arms, And curl the world. Batt. Beggar, stand back, I say. Marc. No; I will shadow your adored mortal, And shake my rags at him. Dost fear the plague? Musk-fingered boy, aside! Oraz. What madman's this? Rosau. Keep him away from me! His hideous raggedness tears the soft sight, Where it is pictured. Marc. Your clutch is like the grasping of a wave: Off from my shoulder!—Now, my velvet fellow, Let's measure limbs. Well, is your flesh to mine As gold to lead, or but the common plaister That wraps up bones? Your skin is not of silk; Your face not painted with an angel's feather With tints from morning's lip, but the daubed clay; These veiny pipes hold a dog's lap of blood. Let us shake hands; I tell thee, brother skeleton, We're but a pair of puddings for the dinner Of Lady worm; you served in silks and gems, I garnished with plain rags. Have I unlocked thee? Oraz. Insolent beggar! Marc. Prince! but we must shake hands. Look you, the round earth's sleeping like a serpent, Who drops her dusty tail upon her crown Just here. Oh, we are like two mountain peaks, Of two close planets, catching in the air: You, King Olympus, a great pile of summer, Wearing a crown of gods; I, the vast top Of the ghosts' deadly world, naked and dark, With nothing reigning on my desolate head But one old spirit of a murdered god, Palaced within the corpse of Saturn's father. Then let's come near and hug. There's nothing like thee But I thy contrast.—Thou'rt a prince, they say? Oraz. That you shall learn. You knaves, that wear my livery, Will you permit me still to be defiled By this worm's venom? Tread upon his neck, And let's walk over him. Marc. Forbear, my lord! I am a king of that most mighty empire, That's built o'er all the earth, upon kings' crowns; And poverty's its name; whose every hut Stands on a coronet, or star, or mitre, The glorious corner-stones.—But you are weary, And would be playing with a woman's cheek: Give me a purse then, prince. Oraz. No, not a doit: The metal, I bestow, shall come in chains. Marc. Well, I can curse. Ay, prince, you have a brother— Oraz. The Duke,—he'll scourge you. Marc. Nay, the second, sir, Who, like an envious river, flows between Your footsteps and Ferrara's throne. Oraz. He's gone: Asia, and Africa, the sea he went on, Have many mouths,—and in a dozen years, (His absence' time,) no tidings or return, Tell me We are but two. Marc. If he were in Ferrara— Oraz. Stood he before me there, By you, in you,—as like as you're unlike, Straight as you're bowed, young as you are old And many years nearer than him to death, The falling brilliancy of whose white sword Your ancient locks so silverly reflect,— I would deny, outswear, and overreach, And pass him with contempt, as I do you.— Jove! how we waste the stars: set on, my friends. Batt. But the old ruffian? Oraz. Think of him to-morrow. See, Venus rises in the softening heaven: Let not your eyes abuse her sacred beams, By looking through their gentleness on ought But lips, and eyes, and blushes of dear love. Song. Strike, you myrtle-crowned boys, Ivied maidens, strike together: Magic lutes are these, whose noise Our fingers gather, Threaded thrice with golden strings From Cupid's bow; And the sounds of its sweet voice Not air, but little busy things, Pinioned with the lightest feather Of his wings, Rising up at every blow Round the chords, like flies from roses Zephyr-touched; so these light minions Hover round, then shut their pinions, And drop into the air, that closes Where music's sweetest sweet reposes. [Exit Orazio with his retinue. Marc. (solus.) Then who hath solitude, like mine, that is not The last survivor of a city's plague, Eating the mess he cooked for his dead father? Who is alone but I? there's fellowship In churchyards and in hell: but I!—no lady's ghost Did ever cling with such a grasp of love Unto its soft dear body, as I hung Rooted upon this brother. I went forth Joyfully, as the soul of one who closes His pillowed eyes beside an unseen murderer, And like its horrible return was mine, To find the heart, wherein I breathed and beat, Cold, gashed, and dead. Let me forget to love, And take a heart of venom: let me make A stair-case of the frightened breasts of men, And climb into a lonely happiness! And thou, who only art alone as I, Great solitary god of that one sun, I charge thee, by the likeness of our state, Undo these human veins that tie me close To other men, and let your servant griefs Unmilk me of my mother, and pour in Salt scorn and steaming hate! Enter Ezril. Ezr. How now, my lord? Marc. Much better, my kind Jew. They've weeded out A troublesome wild plant that grew upon me, My heart: I've trampled it to dust, and wept it Wetter than Nilus' side. Out of the sun! And let him bake it to a winged snake. —Well, you've been shouldered from the palace steps, And spurned as I?—No matter. Ezr. Nay, my lord! Come with me: lay aside these squalid wrappings: Prepare that honoured head to fit a crown, For 'twill be empty of your brother soon. Marc. What starry chance has dropped out of the skies? What's this? Oh! now if it should but be so, I'll build a bridge to heaven. Tell me, good Jew; Excellent Ezril, speak. Ezr. At your command I sought the ducal palace, and, when there, Found all the wild-eyed servants in the courts Running about on some dismaying errand, In the wild manner of a market crowd, Waked, from the sunny dozing at their stalls, By one who cries “the city is on fire;” Just so they crossed, and turned, and came again. I asked of an old man, what this might mean; And he, yet grappling with the great disaster As if he would have killed it, like a fable, By unbelief, coldly, as if he spoke Of something gone a century before, Told me, the Duke in hunting had been thrown, And lay on his last bed. Marc. Ha! well! what next? You are the cup-bearer of richest joy.— But it was a report, a lie.—Have done— I read it on your lip. Ezr. It was too true. I went to his bedside, and there made trial Of my best skill in physic, with the zeal Due to my sovereign. Marc. Impious, meddling fool! To thrust yourself 'twixt heaven and its victim! Ezr. My lord, I think you would not have said so In the sad chamber of the writhing man. He lay in a red fever's quenchless flames, Burning to dust: despairing of my skill, I sat myself beside his heart, and spoke Of his next brother. When he heard of you, He bade be summoned all his counsellors, To witness his bequeathing his dominion Wholly to you. Marc. Why did you let me wait? Come, let's be quick: he keeps beneath his pillow A kingdom, which they'll steal if we're too late. We must o'ertake his death. [Exeunt. Scene II. A saloon in Orazio's palace, brilliantly lighted: at the bottom of the stage open folding-doors, through which a banqueting-room is seen, with a table, at which Orazio and his guests, feasting, are partially visible. Music and Song. Will you sleep these dark hours, maiden, Beneath the vine that rested Its slender boughs, so purply-laden, All the day around that elm Nightingale-nested, Which yon dark hill wears for an helm, Pasture-robed and forest-crested? There the night of lovely hue Peeps the fearful branches through, And ends in those two eyes of blue. Orazio and Armida come forward. Armid. What! wrap a frown in myrtle, and look sad Beneath the shadow of an ivy wreath? This should not be, my lord. Oraz. Armida dear, I'm weary of their laughter's empty din. Methinks, these fellows, with their ready jests, Are like to tedious bells, that ring alike Marriage or death. I would we were alone— Asleep, Armida. Armid. They will soon be gone: One half-hour more— Oraz. No, it could not be so:— I think and think—Sweet, did you like the feast? Armid. Methought, 'twas gay enough. Oraz. Now, I did not. 'Twas dull: all men spoke slow and emptily. Strange things were said by accident. Their tongues Uttered wrong words: one fellow drank my death, Meaning my health; another called for poison, Instead of wine; and, as they spoke together, Voices were heard, most loud, which no man owned: There were more shadows too than there were men; And all the air, more dark and thick than night, Was heavy, as 'twere made of something more Than living breaths.— Armid. Nay, you are ill, my lord: 'Tis merely melancholy. Oraz. There were deep hollows And pauses in their talk; and then, again, On tale, and song, and jest, and laughter rang, Like a fiend's gallop. By my ghost, 'tis strange.— Armid. Come, my lord, join your guests; they look with wonder Upon your lonely mood. Oraz. It is the trick Of these last livers to unbuild belief: They'd rob the world of spirit. Then each look, Ay, every aspect of the earth and sky, Man's thought and hope, are lies.—Well; I'll return, And look at them again. (He approaches the door of the inner room: from which Michele advances.) Mich. You're tired, my lord. Our visit's long: break off, good gentlemen: The hour is late. Oraz. Nay, I beseech you, stay: My pleasure grows on yours. I'm somewhat dull; But let me not infect you. (Exeunt Michele and Armida through the folding door: Orazio is following them, but is stopped by the entry of an Attendant, from the side. What with you? Attend. A lady, in the garment of a nun, Desires to see you. Oraz. Lead her in: all such I thank for their fair countenance. Enter Valeria, introduced by Attendant, who withdraws. Gentle stranger, Your will with me? Valer. I am the bearer of another's will: A woman, whose unhappy fondness yet May trouble her lord's memory,—Valeria,— Your's for a brief, blessed time, who now dwells In her abandoned being patiently, But not unsorrowing, sends me. Oraz. My wronged wife! Too purely good for such a man as I am! If she remembers me, then Heaven does too, And I am not yet lost. Give me her thoughts,— Ay, the same words she put into thine ears, Safe and entire, and I will thank thy lips With my heart's thanks. But tell me how she fares. Valer. Well; though the common eye, that has a tear, Would drop it for the paleness of her skin, And the wan shivering of her torch of life; Though she be faint and weak, yet very well: For not the tincture, or the strength of limb, Is a true health, but readiness to die.— But let her be, or be not.— Oraz. Best of ladies! And, if thy virtues did not glut the mind, To the extinction of the eye's desire, Such a delight to see, that one would think Our looks were thrown away on meaner things, And given to rest on thee! Valer. These words, my lord, Are charitable; it is very kind To think of her sometimes: for, day and night, As they flow in and out of one another, She sits beside and gazes on their streams, So filled with the strong memory of you, That all her outward form is penetrated, Until the watery portrait is become Not hers, but yours:—and so she is content To wear her time out. Oraz. Softest peace enwrap her! Content be still the breathing of her lips! Be tranquil ever, thou blest life of her! And that last hour, that hangs 'tween heaven and earth, So often travelled by her thoughts and prayers, Be soft and yielding 'twixt her spirit's wings! Valer. Think'st thou, Orazio, that she dies but once? All round and through the spaces of creation, No hiding-place of the least air, or earth, Or sea, invisible, untrod, unrained on, Contains a thing alone. Not e'en the bird, That can go up the labyrinthine winds Between its pinions, and pursues the summer,— Not even the great serpent of the billows, Who winds him thrice around this planet's waist,— Is by itself, in joy or suffering. But she whom you have ta'en, and, like a leaven, With your existence kneaded, must be ever Another—scarce another—self of thine. Oraz. If she has read her heart aloud to you, Or you have found it open by some chance, Tell me, dear lady, is my name among Her paged secrets? does she, can she love me?— No, no; that's mad:—does she remember me? Valer. She breathes away her weary days and nights Among cold, hard-eyed men, and hides behind A quiet face of woe: but there are things,— A song, a face, a picture, or a word,— Which, by some semblance, touch her heart to tears. And music, starting up among the strings Of a wind-shaken harp, undoes her secresy,— Rolls back her life to the first starry hour Whose flower-fed air you used, to speak of love; And then she longs to throw her bursting breast, And shut out sorrow with Orazio's arms,— Thus,—O my husband! Oraz. Sweetest, sweetest woman! Valeria, thou dost squeeze eternity Into this drop of joy. O come, come, come! Let us not speak;—give me my wife again!— O thou fair creature, full of my own soul! We'll love, we'll love, like nothing under heaven,— Like nought but Love, the very truest god. Here's lip-room on thy cheek:—there, shut thine eye, And let me come, like sleep, and kiss its lid. Again.—What shall I do? I speak all wrong, And lose a soul-full of delicious thought By talking.—Hush! Let's drink each other up By silent eyes. Who lives, but thou and I, My heavenly wife? Valer. Dear Orazio! Oraz. I'll watch thee thus, till I can tell a second By thy cheek's change. O what a rich delight! There's something very gentle in thy cheek, That I have never seen in other women: And, now I know the circle of thine eye, It is a colour like to nothing else But what it means,—that's heaven. This little tress, Thou'lt give it me to look on and to wear, But first I'll kiss its shadow on thy brow. That little, fluttering dimple is too late, If he is for the honey of thy looks: As sweet a blush, as ever rose did copy, Budded and opened underneath my lips, And shed its leaves; and now those fairest cheeks Are snowed upon them. Let us whisper, sweet, And nothing be between our lips and ears But our own secret souls.— (A horn without. Valer. Heaven of the blest, they're here! Oraz. Who, what, Valeria? Thou'rt pale and tremblest: what is it? Valer. Alas! A bitter kernel to our taste of joy, Our foolish and forgetful joy. My father! Destruction, misery— Enter Varini and attendants. Varin. Turn out those slaves,— Burst the closed doors, and occupy the towers.— Oraz. Varini's self! what can his visit bring! Valer. Look there; he's walking hither like a man, But is indeed a sea of stormy ruin, Filling and flooding o'er this golden house From base to pinnacle, swallowing thy lands, Thy gold, thine all.—Embrace me into thee, Or he'll divide us. Oraz. Never! calm thyself.— Now, Count Varini, what's your business here? If as a guest, though uninvited, welcome! If not, then say, what else? Varin. A master, spendthrift! Open those further doors,— Oraz. What? in my palace! Varin. Thine! what is thine beneath the night or day? Not e'en that beggar's carcase,—for within that The swinish devils of filthy luxury Do make their stye.—No lands, no farms, no houses,— Thanks to thy debts, no gold. Go out! Thou'rt nothing, Besides a grave and a deep hell. Valer. Orazio, Thou hast Valeria: the world may shake thee off, But thou wilt drop into this breast, this love,— And it shall hold thee. Oraz. What? lost already! O that curst steward! I have fallen, Valeria, Deeper than Lucifer, though ne'er so high,— Into a place made underneath all things, So low and horrible that hell's its heaven. Varin. Thou shalt not have the idiot, though she be The very fool and sickness of my blood.— Gentlemen, here are warrants for my act,— His debts, bonds, forfeitures, taxes and fines, O'erbalancing the worth of his estates, Which I have bought: behold them!—For the girl, Abandoned, after marriage, by the villain,— I am her father: let her be removed; And, if the justice of my rightful cause Ally you not, at least do not resist me. Mich. What are these writings? Batt. Bills under the Duke's seal, All true and valid.—Poor Orazio! Oraz. Why, the rogue pities me! I'm down indeed. Valer. Help me! Oh! some of you have been beloved, Some must be married.—Will you let me go? Will you stand frozen there, and see them cut Two hearts asunder?—Then you will,—you do.— Are all men like my father? are all fathers So far away from men? or all their sons So heartless?—you are women, as I am; Then pity me, as I would pity you, And pray for me! Father! ladies! friends!— But you are tearless as the desart sands.— Orazio, love me! or, if thou wilt not, Yet I will love thee: that you cannot help. Oraz. My best Valeria! never shalt thou leave me, But with my life. O that I could put on These feeble arms the proud and tawny strength Of the lion in my heart! Varin. Out with the girl at once! Rosaur. Forgive them, sir, we all of us beseech. Varin. Lady, among you all she's but one sire, And he says no.—Away! Valer. Have pity, my sweet father! my good father! Have pity, as my gentle mother would, Were she alive,—thy sainted wife! O pardon, If I do wish you had been rent asunder, Thus dreadfully; for then I had not been;— Not kissed and wept upon my father's hand, And he denied me!—you can make me wretched:— Be cruel still, but I will never hate you.— Orazio, I'll tell thee what it is: The world is dry of love; we've drunk it all With our two hearts— Oraz. Farewell, Valeria! Take on thy last dear hand this truest kiss, Which I have brought thee from my deepest soul.— Farewell, my wife!— Valer. They cannot part us long.— What's life? our love is an eternity: O blessed hope! (She is forced out. Oraz. Now then, sir; speak to me: The rest is sport,—like rain against a tower Unpalsied by the ram. Go on: what's next? Varin. Your palaces are mine, your sheep-specked pastures, Forest and yellow corn-land, grove and desart, Earth, water, wealth: all, that you yesterday Were mountainously rich and golden with, I, like an earthquake, in this minute take. Go, go: I will not pick thee to the bones: Starve as you will. Oraz. How, sir! am I not wealthy? Why, if the sun could melt the brazen man That strode o'er Corinth, and whose giant form Stretched its swart limbs along sea, island, mountain, While night appeared its shadow,—if he could,— Great, burning Phœbus' self—could melt ought of him, Except the snow-drift on his rugged shoulder, Thou hast destroyed me! Varin. Thanks to these banquets of Olympus' top From whence you did o'erturn whole Niles of wine, And made each day as rainy as that hour When Perseus was begot, I have destroyed thee, Or thou thyself; for, such a luxury Would wring the gold out of its rocky shell, And leave the world all hollow.—So, begone; My lord, and beggar! Batt. Noble, old Varini, Think, is it fit to crush into the dirt Even the ruins of nobility? Take comfort, sir. Oraz. Who am I now? How long is a man dying or being born? Is't possible to be a king and beggar In half a breath? or to begin a minute I'th' west, and end it in the furthest east? O no! I'll not believe you. When I do, My heart will crack to powder.—Can you speak? Then do: shout something louder than my thoughts, For I begin to feel. Enter a Messenger. Mess. News from the court: The Duke— Oraz. My brother—speak— Was he not ill, and on a perilous bed? Speak life and death,—thou hast them on thy tongue,— One's mine, the other his:—a look, a word, A motion;—life or death? Mess. The Duke is dead. (Battista and the other guests kneel to Orazio, Batt. Then we salute in thee another sovereign. Oraz. Me then, who just was shaken into chaos, Thou hast created! I have flown, somehow, Upwards a thousand miles: my heart is crowned.— Your hands, good gentlemen; sweet ladies, yours:— And what new godson of the bony death,— Of fire, or steel, or poison,—shall I make For old Varini? Varin. Your allegiance, sirs, Wanders: Orazio is a beggar still. Batt. Is it not true then that the duke is dead? Oraz. Not dead? O slave! Varin. The Duke is dead, my lords; And, on his death-bed, did bestow his crown Upon his second brother, Lord Marcello,— Ours, and Ferrara's, Duke. Oraz. I'll not believe it: Marcello is abroad. Varin. His blest return, This providential day, has saved our lives From thine abhorred sway. Orazio, go: And, though my clemency is half a crime, I spare your person. Oraz. I'll to the palace. When we meet next, be blessed if thou dost kiss The dust about my ducal chair. (Exit. Varin. I shall be there, To cry Long live Marcello! in thine ear.— Pray pardon me the breaking of this feast, Ladies,—and so, good night. Rosaur. Your wish is echoed by our inmost will: Good night to Count Varini. (Exeunt guests. Attend. My lord— Varin. What are they, sirrah? Attend. The palace-keys. There is a banquet in the inner room: Shall we remove the plate? Varin. Leave it alone: Wine in the cups, the spicy meats uncovered, And the round lamps each with a star of flame Upon their brink; let winds begot on roses, And grey with incense, rustle through the silk And velvet curtains:—then set all the windows, The doors and gates, wide open; let the wolves, Foxes, and owls, and snakes, come in and feast; Let the bats nestle in the golden bowls, The shaggy brutes stretch on the velvet couches, The serpent twine him o'er and o'er the harp's Delicate chords:—to Night, and all its devils, We do abandon this accursed house. [Exeunt. ACT II. Scene I. An apartment in Varini's palace. Enter Valeria and a female attendant. Attend. Will you not sleep, dear lady? you are weary, And yet thus eager, quick, and silently, Like one who listens for a midnight sign, You wander up and down from room to room, With that wide, sightless eye,—searching about For what you know not. Will you not to bed? Valer. No, not to night: my eyes will not be closed, My heart will not be darkened. Sleep is a traitor: He fills the poor, defenceless eyes with blackness, That he may let in dreams. I am not well; My body and my mind are ill-agreed, And comfortlessly strange; faces and forms And pictures, friendly to my life-long knowledge, Look new and unacquainted,—every voice Is hollow, every word inexplicable,— And yet they seem to be a guilty riddle,— And every place, though unknown as a desart, Feels like the spot where a forgotten crime Was done by me in sleep. Night, O be kind! I do not come to watch thy secret acts, Or thrust myself on Nature's mysteries At this forbidden hour: bestow thy dews, Thy calm, thy quiet sweetness, sacred mother, And let me be at ease! Now, thou kind girl, Take thy pale cheeks to rest. Attend. I am not weary: Believe me now, I am not. Valer. But, my child, Those eyelids, tender as the leaf of spring,— Those cheeks should lay their roseate delicacy Under the kiss of night, the feathery sleep; For there are some, whose study of the morn Is ever thy young countenance and hue. Ah maid! you love. Attend. I'll not deny it, madam. O that sweet influence of thoughts and looks! That change of being, which, to one who lives, Is nothing less divine than divine life To the unmade! Love? Do I love? I walk Within the brilliance of another's thought, As in a glory. I was dark before, As Venus' chapel in the black of night: But there was something holy in the darkness, Softer and not so thick as other where; And, as rich moonlight may be to the blind, Unconsciously consoling. Then love came, Like the out-bursting of a trodden star, And what before was hueless and unseen Now shows me a divinity, like that Which, raised to life out of the snowy rock, Surpass'd mankind's creation, and repaid Heaven for Pandora. Valer. Innocently thought, And worthy of thy youth! I should not say How thou art like the daisy in Noah's meadow, On which the foremost drop of rain fell warm And soft at evening; so the little flower Wrapped up its leaves, and shut the treacherous water Close to the golden welcome of its breast,— Delighting in the touch of that which led The shower of oceans, in whose billowy drops Tritons and lions of the sea were warring, And sometimes ships on fire sunk in the blood Of their own inmates; others were of ice, And some had islands rooted in their waves, Beasts on their rocks, and forest-powdering winds, And showers tumbling on their tumbling self,— And every sea of every ruined star Was but a drop in the world-melting flood.— Attend. Lady, you utter dreams. Valer. Let me talk so: I would o'erwhelm myself with any thoughts; Ay, hide in madness from the truth. Persuade me To hope that I am not a wretched woman, Who knows she has an husband by his absence, Who feels she has a father by his hate, And wakes and mourns, imprisoned in this house, The while she should be sleeping, mad, or dead.— Thou canst, and pity on thine eyelid hangs, Whose dewy silence drops consent,—thou wilt! I've seen thee smile with calm and gradual sweetness, As none, that were not good, could light their cheeks:— Thou wilt assist me. Harden not those lips, Those lovely kissings let them not be stone With a denial! Attend. But your father's anger,— The watchful faith of all the servants— Valer. Fear not: Lend me thy help. O come,—I see thou wilt.— Husband, I'll lay me on thine aching breast For once and ever.—Haste! for see, the light Creates for earth its day once more, and lays The star of morn's foundation in the east. Come—come— [Exeunt. Scene II. Place before the ducal palace. Guards driving Orazio from the gate. Guard. Back! desperate man: you cannot pass— Oraz. By heaven, I must and will:— Guard. By the duke's order, The gates are locked on all to-day. Oraz. By mine, By the duke's brother's order, or his force, Open at once yon gates. Slave, by my blood, But that I think thou know'st me not, I'd make That corpse of thine my path. Undo, I say, The knitting of this rebel house's arms, And let their iron welcome be around me. My sword is hungry: do't. Guard. Advance no further: Another step, and all our swords shake hands Within your breast. Oraz. Insolent worm of earth, To earth and worms for this! [He draws his sword. Guard. Strike all! strike strong! Strike through him right. [They fight. Enter Ezril from the palace. Ezr. Peace, on your lives, you traitors! What! would you stain the holy throne of justice, The pure and peaceful temple of the law, The sacred dwelling of Ferrara's soul, With the foul juices of your drunken veins? Put up your impious swords. Guard. Pardon our hasty and forgetful choler: We but defend our duke against the outrage Of this intemperate brawler. Oraz. Cut him to shreds, and fling him to the dogs.— You wait upon the duke, sir? Ezr. I am one Of Lord Marcello's followers. Oraz. Pray you then, Speak to your Lord Marcello: let him know These house-dogs, these his ducal latch-holders Dare keep the bolt against his brother's knock. Ezr. Are you then—? Oraz. I am Lord Orazio.— Be quick!—O nature, what a snail of men! The morn is frosty, sir: I love not waiting.— Ezr. Now all the mercy of the heavens forbid That thou should'st be that rash and wretched neighbour Of the duke's crown, his brother! Oraz. Marcello is my brother; I am his; If coming of one mother brother us: He is the duke, and I Orazio; He elder, younger I.—If Jove and Neptune, And the third Pluto, being Saturn's boys, Lying in Rheas' womb and on her breast, Were therefore brethren, so are he and I,— Marcello's mother's son, his grandame's grandson, Marcello's father's babe, his uncle's nephew, His nephew's uncle, brother of his brother, Or what you like,—if this same word of brother Sours the sore palate of a royal ear. Ezr. Better thou wert the brother of his foe Than what thou art, a man of the same getting; As, out of the same lump of sunny Nile, Rises a purple-winged butterfly, And a cursed serpent crawls. Oraz. Heart-withered, pale-scalped grandfather of lies! Age-hidden monster! Tell me what thou meanest, And then I'll stab thee for thy falsehood.— Ezr. Hold him! Your swords between us!—Now, the duke condemns thee; And by his mother's, and his father's grave, And by the dead, that lies within this palace, His brother's sacred corpse, he dreadly swears; And by the heaven those three loved souls Dwell and are blest in, twice he dreadly swears: By which dread oath, and hate of all thy crimes, The duke condemns thee,—mixing in his sentence, Sweet mercy, tearful love, and justice stern,— To banishment for ever from this hour. Oraz. O reddest hour of wrath and cruelty! Banished!—Why not to death? Ezr. The pious hope, That bitter solitude and suffering thought Will introduce repentance to thy woes, And that conduct thee to religious fear And humbleness, the lark that climbs heaven's stairs But lives upon the ground:—Go forth, Orazio; Seek not the house or converse of a citizen, But think thyself outside the walls of life: If in Ferrara, after this decree, Your darkest, deepest, and most fearful fear Falls on thy shoulder, digs beneath thy feet, And opens hell for thee.—So, pass away! Oraz. Stay, for an instant; listen to a word: O lead me to his throne! Let me but look Upon the father in my brother's face! Let me but speak to him this kindred voice, Our boyish thoughts in the familiar words Of our one bed-room; let me show to him That picture which contains our double childhood, Embracing in inexplicable love, Within each other's, in our mother's, arms; Thou'lt see rejoicing, O thou good old man, The rigour melting through his changed eyes Off his heart's roots, between whose inmost folds Our love is kept. Ezr. Impossible and vain! Content thee with thy doom, and look for love Over the sea-wide grave. Let us be gone! [Exit with Guards. Oraz. Let me write to him,—send a message to him,— A word, a touch, a token! old, benevolent man, Stay with me then to comfort and advise: Leave one of these beside me: throw me not Alone into despair!—He's gone; they're gone; They never will come back; ne'er shall I hear The sweet voice of my kinsmen or my friends: But here begins the solitude of death. I was,—I am; O what a century Of darkness, rocks, and ghostly tempest opens Between those thoughts! Within it there are lost Dearest Valeria,—Marcello, whose heart came From the same place as mine,—and all mankind; Affection, charity, joy: and nothing's cast Upon this barren rock of present time, Except Orazio's wreck! here let it lie. [Throws himself down. Enter Varini and Attendants. Varin. Not in the city? Have you asked the guards At bridge and gate,—the palace sentinels? Attend. We have,—in vain: they have not seen her pass. Varin. And did you say Valeria,—my Valeria,— Heaven's love,—earth's beauty? Oraz. (starting up) Mine eternally! Let heaven unscabbard each star-hilted lightning, And clench ten thousand hands at once against me,— Earth shake all graves to one, and rive itself From Lybia to the North! in spite of all That threatens, I will stun the adulterous gods,— She's mine! Valeria's mine! dash me to death,— From death to the eternal depth of fire,— I laugh and triumph on the neck of fate: For still she's mine for ever! give me her, Or I will drag thee to a sea-side rock, That breaks the bottoms of the thunder-clouds, And taking thee by this old, wicked hair, Swing thee into the winds.— Varin. I would, wild man, That I could quench thine eyes' mad thirst with her. She's gone, fled, lost. O think not any more— Let us forget what else is possible,— Yea hope impossibly! the city streets, The quay, the gardens,—is there yet a place Within night's skirt unsearched? Oraz. The wood of wolves:— Varin. Merciful god! that frightful forest grows Under the darksome corner of the sky Where death's scythe hangs: its murder-shading trees Are hairs upon Hell's brow. Away: away! And never dare to turn on me again Those eyes, unfilled with—speak to me never, Until you cry—“Behold Valeria!” And drop her on my bosom. Oraz. We'll wind the gordian paths off the trees' roots, Untie the hilly mazes, and seek her Till we are lost. Help, ho! [Exit with attendants. Varin. Blessings of mine Feather your speed! and my strong prayers make breaches Through the air before you! [He sits down on the palace-step. Now I'll close my eyes, And, seated on this step, await their coming. Strange and delightful meetings, on strange lands, Of dead-esteemed friends have happened oft, And such a blessed and benevolent chance Might bring her here unheard; for on the earth She goes with her light feet, still as the sparrow Over the air, or through the grass its shade. Behind me would she steal, unknown, until Her lip fell upon mine. It might be so: I'll wait awhile, and hope it. Enter Valeria. Valer. I know not what it means. None speak to me: The crowded street, and solid flow of men, Dissolves before my shadow and is broken. I pass unnoticed, though they search for me, As I were in the air and indistinct As crystal in a wave. There lies a man:— Shall I intreat protection and concealment, And thaw the pity of his wintry head? —No time: they come like arrows after me:— I must avoid them. [Exit. Enter Ezril and attendants. Ezr. Pursue, o'ertake, stay, seize that hurrying girl: Muffle her face and form, and through the bye-ways Convey her to the palace. Hasten, hounds! [Exeunt. Varin. Thou magical deceiver, precious Fancy! Even now, out of this solitude and silence, Seemed,—it was thy creation,—music flowing, And a conviction of some unseen influence; I could have pointed to that empty spot, And said, there stands the presence of my daughter! The air seemed shaken by that voice of hers,— But 'tis all hushed. [Some of his attendants return. How now? speak some of you. What's here? Attend. A veil and mantle.— Varin. Both Valeria's! Where's she they should have wrapped? Attend. 'Twas all we found. Varin. Where? Attend. On the grass this purple cloak was dropped, Beside the river. Varin. And the veil,—which way? Further on shore, or near those deadly waves? Attend. The veil, my lord,— Varin. 'Tis drenched and dropping wet: Would I were drowned beside her! thou wert white; And thy limbs' wond'rous victory over snow Did make the billows thirsty to possess them. They drank thee up, thou sweet one, cruelly! Who was in heaven then? Enter Orazio and Attendants, bearing a corpse that is carried up the stage. Oraz. My love, art dead? Wilt thou not ope thy lips, lift up thine eyes? It is the air, the sun— Attend. (to Varini.) We've found the corpse. Orazio. Her corpse! O no! she is Valeria still: She's scarce done living yet: her ghost's the youngest! To-morrow, she'll be—Oh what she will be? No she,—a corpse, and then—a skeleton!— Varin. Hast looked upon her? Attend. Death has marred her features,— So swollen and discoloured their delight, As if he feared that Life should know her sweet one, And take her back again. Varin. If it be so, I'll see her once: that beauty being gone, And the familiar tokens altered quite, She's strange,—a being made by wicked Death, And I'll not mourn her. Lead me to the corpse. [Exit with attendants. Oraz. Henceforth, thou tender pity of mankind, Have nought to do with weeping: let war's eyes Sweat with delight; and tears be ta'en from grief, And thrown upon the rocky cheek of hate! For mark! that water, the soft heap of drops,— Water, that feigns to come from very heaven In the round shape of sorrow,—that was wont to wash Sin from the new-born babe, is hard and bloody; A murderer of youth; cold death to those Whose life approved thy godhead, piteous virtue! Enter Ezril and guards. Ezr. Here still, unhappy man? then take the doom You wooe so obstinately.—To the dungeon,— To the deepest chamber of the dayless rock: Away, and down with him! Oraz. I care not whither. Thou canst not drag me deeper, wrap me darker, Or torture me as my own thoughts have done. [Exeunt. ACT III. Scene I. A room in the ducal palace. Marcello alone. Marc. I have them all at last; swan-necked Obedience; And Power that strides across the muttering people, Like a tall bridge; and War, the spear-maned dragon:— Such are the potent spirits he commands, Who sits within the circle of a crown! Methought that love began at woman's eye: But thou, bright imitation of the sun, Kindlest the frosty mould around my heart-roots, And, breathing through the branches of my veins, Makest each azure tendril of them blossom Deep, tingling pleasures, musically hinged, Dropping with starry sparks, goldenly honied, And smelling sweet with the delights of life. At length I am Marcello. Enter Ezril. Ezr. Mighty Duke, Ferrara's nobles wait on you, to proffer The homage of their coronets. Marc. I shall not see them. Ezr. It was the ancient usage of the state, In every age.— Marc. Henceforth, be it forgotten! I will not let the rabble's daily sight Be my look's playmate. Say unto them, Ezril, Their sovereigns of foretime were utter men, False gods, that beat an highway in their thoughts Before my car; idols of monarchy, Whose forms they might behold. Now I am come, Be it enough that they are taught my name, Permitted to adore it, swear and pray In it and to it: for the rest I wrap The pillared caverns of my palace round me, Like to a cloud, and rule invisibly On the god-shouldering summit of mankind. Dismiss them so. Ezr. 'Tis dangerous,— Marc. Begone! Each minute of man's safety he does walk A bridge, no thicker than his frozen breath, O'er a precipitous and craggy danger Yawning to death! [Exit Ezril. A perilous sea it is, 'Twixt this and Jove's throne, whose tumultuous waves Are heaped, contending ghosts! There is no passing, But by those slippery, distant stepping-stones, Which frozen Odin trod, and Mahomet, With victories harnessed to his crescent sledge, And building waves of blood upon the shallows, O'erpassed triumphant: first a pile of thrones And broken nations, then the knees of men, From whence, to catch the lowest root of heaven, We must embrace the winged waist of fame, Or nest within opinion's palmy top 'Till it has mixed its leaves with Atlas' hair, Quicker to grow than were the men of Cadmus— Re-enter Ezril. Ezr. They are departing, with the unequal pace Of discontent and wonder. Marc. Send them home To talk it with their wives: sow them with books Of midnight marvels, witcheries, and visions: Let the unshaven Nazarite of stars Unbind his wondrous locks, and grandame's earthquake Drop its wide jaw; and let the church-yard's sleep Whisper out goblins. When the fools are ripe And gaping to the kernel, thou shalt steal, And lay the egg of my divinity In their fermenting sides.—Where is my brother? The first I'll aim at. Ezr. 'Mid the poisonous dregs of this deep building, Two days and their two nights have had his breath All of one colour to his darkened eyes. No voice has fed his ears, and little food His speech-robbed lips. Marc. 'Tis well. This is a man Whose state has sunk i'th' middle of his thoughts: And in their hilly shade, as in a vale, I'll build my church, making his heart the quarry. Take him his meal, and place a guard around The wood below: the rest of my instructions, For we must juggle boldly, shall be whispered Secretly in my closet. Ezr. Will you not First cast this ragged and unseemly garb, And hang your sides with purple? Marc. No: these rags Give my delight a sting. I'll sit in them; And, when I've stretched my dukedom through men's souls, Fix on its shore my chair, and from it bid Their doubts lie down.—Wilt help me? Ezr. Duke, thou art A fathomless and undiscovered man, Thinking above the eagle's highest wings, And underneath the world. Go on: command: And I am thine to do. [Exeunt. Scene II. A dungeon of Cyclopean architecture: Orazio lying on the ground. Enter Marcello and Ezril. Marc. Thou hast her then, in secret and secure? Ezr. Not firmer or more quietly this body Holds its existing spirit. Marc. Excellent Ezril! Thanks, thanks: my gratitude is snail-paced slow, So heavy is its burthen.—See'st thou yonder? Ezr. The husband: where his sorrow, strong in error, Has spurned him down. Marc. I'll raise the broken man: Ay, I will place my feet upon his soul, And weigh him up.—Leave us alone, good Ezril.— Exit Ezril. Lie there: I see the winding, darkening path Into thine heart, its mouth and its recess, As clear as if it were a forest's cavern, Open to my approach. Henceforth be thou Another habitation of my life, Its temple, its Olympus, next in birth to, And pressing close beneath the unknown cloud In which it reigns! Ho! sleep'st thou here? Mak'st thou the branch-dividing, light noon-air Thy bed-room? Rise! what dost thou on the ground? Oraz. Didst thou say, Rise? I stand. Where am I now, And how? Marc. Alive, and in Ferrara. Oraz. Why, first there is a life, and then a death, And then a life again, whose roof is death; So I have heard. 'Tis true: and though I am Beside you, there's a grave divides our beings, Which is the second gate of birth to me.— Leave me to weep and groan. Marc. What ails thee thus? Thy nature is o'erturned, thy features all Forget joy's offices. These sinking eyes, Whose sight is but a secondary service, The ashy hiding of thy cheeks,—its cause? Oraz. Am I so like to marble in my form, So wicked at the heart? No; thou art bad: A charitable man would never ask. And if thou e'er hadst love, or been once human,— Loved, grieved, or hoped,—thou'dst feel what I have lost. My wife is dead! thou know'st not what I mean, And therefore art accurst. Now let me weep.— Marc. Thou dost me wrong. Lament! I'd have thee do't: The heaviest raining is the briefest shower. Death is the one condition of our life: To murmur were unjust; our buried sires Yielded their seats to us, and we shall give Our elbow-room of sunshine to our sons. From first to last the traffic must go on; Still birth for death. Shall we remonstrate then? Millions have died that we might breathe this day: The first of all might murmur, but not we. Grief is unmanly too.— Oraz. Because 'tis godlike. I never felt my nature so divine, As at this saddest hour. Thou'dst have me busy In all the common usage of this world: To buy and sell, laugh, jest, and feast, and sleep, And wake and hunger that I might repeat 'em; Perchance to love, to woo, to wed again.— Marc. The wonted wheel.— Oraz. O how I hate thee for't! I've passed through life's best feelings;—they are her's; Humanity's behind me. Ne'er I'll turn, But, consecrated to this holy grief, Live in her memory: heaven has no more. Marc. Yes, she is there. Let not thy woes be impious, Lest ye should never meet; but anchor thee On the remembrance that thou there wilt meet Her deepest self, her spirit. Oraz. Thou talk'st to me of spirits and of souls:— What are they? what know I or you of them? I love no ghost: I loved the fairest woman, With too much warmth and beauty in her cheek, And gracious limbs, to hold together long. To-day she's cold and breathless, and to-morrow They'll lay her in the earth; there she will crumble: Another year no place in all the world, But this poor heart, will know of her existence. Can she come back, O can she ever be The same she was last night in my embrace? No comfort else, no life! Marc. She can. Oraz. What didst thou speak? Blaspheme not nature: wake not hope to stab it: O take not comfort's sacred name in vain! Wilt say it now again? Marc. There is a way, Which, if thy heart's religion could permit,— Oraz. What's that but she? Do it, whate'er it is; I take the sin to me. Come, what will come,— And what but pain can come?—for that will be All paradise concentrate in a minute, When she,—but she is dead; I saw her corpse;— Upon my soul thou liest unfathomably: No god could do it. Marc. I have earned the taunt. Seven heavens do fold the secret from thine eye: Be happily incredulous. Perchance It were a cursed and unhallowed rite: Let's think it all a fiction. So farewell! Oraz. Thou dost not go; thou shalt not leave me thus: No; by the power thou speakest of, I do swear It shall be tried: if unsuccessful, then We shall be what we are. Marc. Not its success I doubt, but its impiety. O be quick To fear perdition! Oraz. Can I fear aught further Than what I feel? Marc. The sting of grief speaks here, And not the tongue of thought. A month, a year Pass in reflection: after such a time, If thou demand'st the same, I'll then assist thee. Oraz. What? dost thou think I'll live another month Without her? No. I did not seek this knowledge: Thou hast created hope, unbidden, in me; Therefore, I charge thee, let it not be killed! I pray not, I beseech thee not, again; But I command thee, by my right to bliss, Which I have lost in trusting thee, to do it, Without an instant's loss. Marc. Must it be so? To-morrow night in the Cathedral vault Valeria will be buried: meet me there. Oraz. Thou wilt not fail? Marc. I will not, on my life. Oraz. Then she is mine again, All and for ever. Marc. (aside.) As thou shalt be mine. [Exeunt severally. ACT IV. Scene I. The Campo Santo. Night. Enter Marcello, Ezril, and Melchior leading Valeria. Valer. Whither, and by what law of man or nature, Do ye thus lead me? Awe of sacred justice, Dread of the clenched punishment that follows The tremulous shoulder of pale, muffled guilt,— Do they not gaze from every silent bed In this sad place? Melch. Sheathe that nurse's tongue. There's wooing 'twixt the moon and Death to night: This is his cabinet. Marc. 'Beseech you, lady, Break not this still submission, and so force us To stir our power from 'ts feigned, complacent sleep. Valer. Force! dost thou know me, that thou threaten'st force? Melch. Why, thou'rt some wealthy sinner, very like, Whose gloves are worn with lips of richest princes:— It recks not here. The unfashionable worm, Respectless of the crown-illumined brow, The cheek's bewitchment, or the sceptred clench, With no more eyes than Love, creeps courtier-like, On his thin belly, to his food,—no matter How clad or nicknamed it might strut above, What age or sex,—it is his dinner-time. —Now with what name, what coronal's shade, wilt scare Our rigour to the wing? Valer. I have a plea, As dewy-piteous as the gentle ghost's That sits alone upon a forest-grave, Thinking of no revenge: I have a mandate, As magical and potent as e'er ran Silently through a battle's myriad veins, Undid their fingers from the hanging steel, And drew them up in prayer: I am a woman. O motherly remembered be the name, And, with the thought of loves and sisters, sweet And comforting! therefore be piteous to me. O let my hand touch yours! I could do more By its sad tremors than my tongue. Melch. Away! We own a mood of marble. There's no earth In any crevice of my well-built spirit, Whence woman's rain could wake the weedy leaves Of the eye-poison, pity. Marc. If I were Another man than this, Nature's cast child, Renounced by Life and Death of common men, And placed by wrongs upon an island-peak, Methinks I could relent. Melch. Draw up thyself. This bearskin, charity, is a great coat For ragged, shivering sin: thine Indian hate, That shivers, like the serpent's noontide tongue, With poisonous, candid heat, must trample on it. Valer. O icy hearts! but no; soft ice doth melt, And warms contritely;—I renounce the words, And roll away the tender side of Heaven To bare its lightnings. I am innocent,— As white as any angel's lily wing; And if you wrong me, mark! I will not weep, Nor pray against your souls, nor curse your lives, Nor let my madness wake all things that are To roll destruction on you,—but be silent, Secret, as happiness, to man and God, And let the judgment ripen silently, Under your feet and o'er you,—mighty, quiet, Deadly and tedious, as a silent hell. Now, what ye dare, begin! Marc. Our purpose glides, Calm and remorseless as this human orb, Whose moon, thou see'st, bestows an equal beam Upon the odorous gardens we passed by, And the gaunt lips of this new-opened grave. Canst thou reproach our want of charity, Beholding this, and all the thoughts it lends? Melch. 'Tis a fit oracle for such an hour, And has the caverns of its inspirations, More true than Delphian, underneath our being. Let's speak to it. Ezr. What would'st thou? Melch. It may teach This tremulous lady resignation, sir.— Ho, there! thou maker of this earthen bed; Thou porter of the gates, art thou below? Whose grave is this thou digg'st? Cætera desunt. TORRISMOND; AN UNFINISHED DRAMA. PERSONS REPRESENTED. Duke of Ferrara. Torrismond; his son. The Marquis Malaspina. Cyrano; his son. Amadeus; a young nobleman. Garcia; Courtier. Gomez; Courtier. Melchior; Courtier. Gaudentio; Courtier. Veronica; Malaspina's daughter. Elvira; her attendant. Erminia; Melchior's sister. Scene; Ferrara. ACT I. Scene I. An apartment in the ducal palace. Enter the Duke, Courtiers, and attendants. Duke. Who has seen Torrismond, my son, tonight? Garcia. My lord, he has not crossed me, all the day. (To Gomez aside.) You need not say we saw him pass the terrace, All red and hot with wine. The duke is angry: Mark how he plucks his robe. Duke. Gomez, nor you? Gomez. Your Grace, in Garcia's answer Beheld the face of mine. I have not lent him A word to-day. Duke. Nor you? none of you, sirs?— No answer! have ye sold yourselves to silence? Is there not breath, or tongue, or mouth among you, Enough to croak a curse?—Nay: there's no wonder. Why do I ask? that know you are his curs, His echo-birds, the mirrors of his tongue. He has locked up this answer in your throats, And scratched it on your leaden memories. What do I ask for? well: go on, go on; Be his sop-oracles, and suck yellow truth Out of the nipple of his jingling pouch. But tell me this, dogs, that do wag your tails Round this dwarf Mercury, this gilded Lie-god, Will you set out and beg with him to-morrow? Garcia. Why, my good lord? Duke. Because, my evil slave,— Because unless he can these sunbeams coin, Or, like a bee in metals, suck me out The golden honey from their marly core, He's like to board with the cameleon: Because I will untie him from my heart, And drop him to the bottom of the world:— Because I'll melt his wings.—Enough! Garcia. With pardon, You are too rough.— Duke. Too rough! were I as loud As shaggy Boreas in his bearish mood,— Did I roll wheels of thunder o'er your souls, And break them into groans,—weep yourselves waves, And kneel beneath my storming. Worms ye are, Born in the fat sides of my pouring wealth:— Lie there and stir not, or I dash you off. Garcia. My lord— Duke. I am no lord, sir, but a father: My son has stuck sharp injuries in my heart, And flies to hide in your obscurity. Cover him not with falsehoods; shield him not; Or, by my father's ashes,—but no matter. You said I was a duke: I will be one, Though graves should bark for it. You've heard me speak: Now go not to your beds until my son (—It is a word that cases not a meaning,—) Come from his riots: send him then to me: And hark! ye fill him not, as ye are wont, To the lip's brim with oily subterfuges.— I sit this evening in the library. An attend. Lights, lights there for the duke! Duke. For the duke's soul I would there were a light! Well; on thy flinty resolution strike, Benighted man! The sun has laid his hair Up in that stone, as I have treasured love In a cold heart;—but it begins to boil, And, if it breaks its casket, will be out. Find me a book of fables: he, whose world Grows in his thoughts, methinks, alone is happy. So now good-night; and do as I have said. Garcia. We shall.—Good dreams, your grace! Duke. Good acts, you mean. He who does ill, awake, and turns to night For lovely-painted shades, Is like a satyr grinning in a brook To find Narcissus' round and downy cheek. (Exit with attendants: manent Garcia and Gomez. Gomez. I never saw my lord so sad and angry: His blood foamed, white with wrath, beneath his face, Rising and falling like a sea-shore wave. What boils him thus? Garcia. Perhaps some further outrage, Reported of his son; for the young lord, Whose veins are stretched by passion's hottest wine, Tied to no law except his lawless will, Ranges and riots headlong through the world;— Like a young dragon, on Hesperian berries Purplely fed, who dashes through the air, Tossing his wings in gambols of desire, And breaking rain-clouds with his bulging breast. Thus has he been from boy to youth and manhood, Reproved, then favoured; threatened, next forgiven; Renounced, to be embraced: but, till this hour, Never has indignation like to this, With lightning looks, black thoughts, and stony words, Burst o'er the palace of their love, which stretches From heart to heart. Gomez. I fear that both will shake; And that fair union, built by interchange Of leaning kindnesses, in the recoil May fall between, and leave no bridge for pardon. Garcia. The little that we can, then let us strive To hold them in the lock of amity: For which our thoughts let us compare within. [Exeunt. Scene II. A banqueting room in Malaspina's palace. Cyrano, Amadeus, Torrismond, and other young lords, drinking. Amad. Another health! Fill up the goblets, sirrah! This wine was pressed from full and rolling grapes By the white dance of a Circassian princess, Whose breast had never aught but sunlight touched, And her own tears: 'tis spicy, cool, and clear As is a magic fount where rainbows grow, Or nymphs by moonlight bathe their tremulous limbs; And works an intellectual alchemy, Touching the thoughts to sunshine. Now, to whom,— To what young saint, between whose breathing paps Love's inspiration lies,—shall we devote This last and richest draught: with whose soft name Shall we wash bright our hearts? Say, Cyrano. Cyran. Let Torrismond be sponsor for this bowl. He sate so still last night, that by plump Cupid, That merry, cherry-lipped, delicious god, Whose name is writ on roses, I must think He's paid away his soul in broken sighs, Glass oaths, and tears of crocodilish coinage, For one quick finger-kiss. Ask him, what name, Made to be written upon hearts and trees, And grace a sonnet, shall be sugar here, Making the juice steam music. Torris. I beseech you, Waste not this Araby of words on me: I'm dull, but not in love. Cyran. Not ancle-deep? What means a leaning head, eye-lids ajar, And lips thick-sown with whispers? Sir, I say, Before to-morrow you'll be soused in love, To the ear's tip. In truth, it will be so; Sure as an almanac. Torris. I lay my fate Upon your mercy: e'en tie love-knots in it, If you've nought else to do. Good Cyrano, And you, sirs, all pray drink. I fear the fog Of my most stupid dulness spreads. Amad. We'll drink One cup,—one more liquid delight, my friends; Then for the masquerade at Signor Paulo's.— Cyran. Ay; dedicated to the sweet To be, The lady Future of our comrade's love. A guest. What rhymes unborn are shut within that word! Amad. Thus then I soak my heart's dear roots in wine, And the warm drops roll up and down my blood, Till every tendril of my straying veins Rings with delight. (They drink. And now, my sons of Bacchus, To the delirious dance!—Nay, Torrismond, You'll come with us at least.— Torris. To night, I thank you, It is against my will; indeed I cannot; I'm vilely out of tune,—my thoughts are cracked, And my words dismal. 'Pray you, pardon me: Some other night we will, like Bacchanals, Shiver the air with laughter and rough songs, And be most jovial madmen. Amad. Be it so, If be it must. We bid you, sir, farewell. Torris. Good night, good lads. [Exeunt Amadeus and others: manent Torrismond and Cyrano. Now go, dear Cyrano; Let me not keep you by my wayward mood. Cyran. If it does not offend you, suffer me— Torris. Offend me! No; thou dost not, Cyrano; I do offend myself. Hadst thou but eyes To see the spirit toiling in this breast, How low a wretch should I appear to thee; How pitifully weak! Now tell me, sir,— I shrink not from the truth, although it stab, And beg it from your mouth,—what think you of me? Cyran. Of you, my lord? Torris. Yes, yes; my words, my manners, My disposition, will,—how seem they to you? Cyran. Sir, my heart speaks of you as one most kind; Spirited and yet mild: a man more noble Breathes not his maker's air. Torris. Stay, my good friend; I did not ask for flattery. Cyran. Nor I answer it; Saying, that here I shake him by the hand That has no better in humanity: A fine, free spirit. Torris. You had better say A whirring, singing, empty wine-bubble, Like one of these that left us. So I was; Vain, futile, frivolous; a boy, a butterfly,— In semblance: but inside, by heaven! a depth Of thoughts most earnest, an unfuelled flame Of self-devouring love. Cyrano, Cyrano, I yearn, and thirst, and ache to be beloved, As I could love,—through my eternal soul, Immutably, immortally, intensely, Immeasurably. Oh! I am not at home In this December world, with men of ice, Cold sirs and madams. That I had a heart, By whose warm throbs of love to set my soul! I tell thee I have not begun to live, I'm not myself, till I've another self To lock my dearest, and most secret thoughts in; Change petty faults, and whispering pardons with; Sweetly to rule, and Oh! most sweetly serve.— Cyran. Have you no father,—nor a friend? Yet I, I, Torrismond, am living, and the duke. Torris. Forgive me, sir, forgive me: I am foolish; I've said I know not what, I know not why; 'Tis nothing,—fancies; I'll to bed;—'tis nothing; Worth but a smile, and then to be forgotten. Good-night: to-morrow I will laugh at this. Cyran. I'll say no more but that I hope you will. [Exit. Torris. I knew it would be so. He thinks me now Weak, unintelligible, fanciful,— A boy shut up in dreams, a shadow-catcher: So let him think. My soul is where he sees not, Around, above, below. Yes, yes; the curse Of being for a little world too great, Demanding more than nature has to give, And drinking up, for ever and in vain, The shallow, tasteless skimmings of their love, Through this unfathomable fever here.— A thought of comfort comes this way; its warmth I feel, although I see it not. How's this? There's something I half know; yes, I remember,— The feast last night: a dear, ingenuous girl Poured soft, smooth hope upon my dashing passions, Until they tossed their billowy selves to sleep. I'll seek her, try her: in this very garden Often she walks; thither I'll bear my wishes, And may she prove the echo of their craving! [Exit. Scene III. A garden by moonlight. Veronica, Elvira and other female attendants. Veron. Come then, a song; a winding, gentle song, To lead me into sleep. Let it be low As zephyr, telling secrets to his rose, For I would hear the murmuring of my thoughts; And more of voice than of that other music That grows around the strings of quivering lutes; But most of thought; for with my mind I listen, And when the leaves of sound are shed upon it, If there's no seed remembrance grows not there. So life, so death; a song, and then a dream! Begin before another dewdrop fall From the soft hold of these disturbed flowers, For sleep is filling up my senses fast, And from these words I sink. Song. How many times do I love thee, dear? Tell me how many thoughts there be In the atmosphere Of a new-fall'n year, Whose white and sable hours appear The latest flake of Eternity:— So many times do I love thee, dear. How many times do I love again? Tell me how many beads there are In a silver chain Of evening rain, Unravelled from the tumbling main, And threading the eye of a yellow star:— So many times do I love again. Elvira. She sees no longer: leave her then alone, Encompassed by this round and moony night. A rose-leaf for thy lips, and then good-night: So life, so death; a song, and then a dream! [Exeunt Elvira and attendants, leaving Veronica asleep. Enter Torrismond. Torris. Herself! her very self, slumbering gently! Sure sleep is turned to beauty in this maid, And all the rivalry of life and death Makes love upon her placid face. And here, How threads of blue, wound off yon thorny stars That grow upon the wall of hollow night, Flow o'er each sister-circle of her bosom, Knotting themselves into a clue for kisses Up to her second lip. There liquid dimples Are ever twinkling, and a sigh has home Deep in their red division,—a soft sigh, Scarce would it bow the summer-weeds, when they Play billows in the fields, and pass a look Of sunshine through their ranks from sword to sword, Gracefully bending. On that cheek the blush That ever dawns dares be no common blush, But the faint ghost of some dishevelled rose Unfurls its momentary leaves, and bursts So quick the haunted fairness knows it not. O that this gaze could be eternity! And yet a moment of her love were more. Were there infection in the mind's disease, Inoculation of a thought, even now Should she, from all the windings of her dream, Drink my impetuous passion, and become All that I ask. Break from your buds, dear eyes, And draw me into you. Veron. (awaking.) Who's there? I dreamt:— As I do love that broad, smooth-edged star, And her young, vandyked moons that climb the night Round their faint mother, I would not have had Another eye peeping upon that dream, For one of them to wear upon my breast; And I'll not whisper it, for fear these flags Should chance to be the green posterity Of that eaves-dropping, woman-witted grass, That robbed the snoring wasps of their least voice, To teach their feathery gossips of the air What long, and furry ears king Midas sprouted; And I'll not think of it, for meditation Oft presses from the heart its inmost wish, And thaws its silence into straying words. Torris. (aside.) I am no man, if this dream were not spun By the very silk-worm, that doth make his shop In Cupid's tender wing-pit, and winds fancies In lovers' corner thoughts, when grandam Prudence Has swept the hearth of passion, thrown on cinders, And gone to bed:—and she is not a woman, If this same secret, buried in her breast, Haunt not her tongue,—and hark! here comes its ghost. Veron. A fable and a dream! Here, in this garden, It seemed I was a lily:— Torris. (aside.) So you are, But fitter for Arabian paradise, Or those arched gardens where pale-petalled stars, With sunlight honeying their dewy cores, Tremble on sinuous, Corinthian necks,— Where Morn her roses feeds, her violets Night. Veron. And to my lily-ship a wooer came, Sailing upon the curvous air of morn, (For 'twas a sunny dream, and a May sky The lid of it;) and this imagined suitor, A glass-winged, tortoise-shell, heart-broken bee, Was—he you know of, heart. How did he bend His slender knee, doffing his velvet cap, And swearing, by the taste of Venus' lip, If I did not accept his airy love, The truest heart, that ever told the minutes Within an insect's breast, should shed its life Around the hilt of his unsheathed sting. And then this tiny thunderer of flowers, Quite, quite subdued, let down a string of tears, (Little they were, but full of beeish truth,) Almost a dew-drop-much, on the fair pages Of transmigrated me; whereon, O Love! Thou tamed'st the straightest prude of Flora's daughters; For I did pity Torrismond the bee, And let him, if his life lived in my love, Have that for courtesy.— Torris. (coming forward) O lady! then Will you deny him now? when here he kneels, And vows by heaven, and by the sacred souls Of all the dead and living, in your pity His hope is folded, in your soul his love, And in that love his everlasting life. Veron. Out on my tongue, the naughty runaway! What has he heard? Now, if this man should be Vain, selfish, light, or hearted with a stone, Or worthless any way, as there are many, I've given myself, like alms unto an idiot, To be for nothing squandered. Torris. Lady, speak! And for my truth, O that my mind were open, My soul expressed and written in a book, That thou might'st read and know! Believe, believe me! And fear me not, for, if I speak not truth, May I speak never more, but be struck dumb! May I be stripped of manhood and made devil, If I mean not as truly unto thee, Though bold it be, as thou unto thyself! I will not swear, for thou dost know that easy: But put me to the proof, say, ‘kill thyself;’ I will outlabour Hercules in will, And in performance, if that waits on will. Shall I fight sword-less with a youthful lion? Shall I do ought that I may die in doing? Oh! were it possible for such an angel, I almost wish thou hadst some impious task, That I might act it and be damned for thee. But, earned for thee, perdition's not itself, Since all that has a taste of thee in it Is blest and heavenly. Veron. Stop! You frighten me: I dare not doubt you. Torris. Dare not? Can you so? Veron. I dare not, for I cannot. I believe you: It is my duty. Torris. To the dutiful Their duty is their pleasure. Is it not? Veron. 'Twas a rash word; it rather is my fate. Torris. It is my fate to love; thou art my fate, So be not adverse. Veron. How can I say further? I do believe you: less I'll not avow, And more I cannot. Torris. Stay, Veronica! This very night we both of us may die, Or one at least: and it is very likely We never meet; or, if we meet, not thus, But somehow hindered by the time, the place, The persons. There are many chances else, That, though no bigger than a sunny mote, Coming between may our whole future part,— With Milo's force tear our existence up, And turn away the branches of each life, Even from this hour, on whose star-knotted trunk We would engraft our union; it may sever us As utterly as if the world should split Here, as we stand, and all Eternity Push through the earthquake's lips, and rise between us. Then let us know each other's constancy: Thou in my mind, and I in thine shall be; And so disseparable to the edge Of thinnest lightning.— Veron. Stay: be answered thus. If thou art Torrismond, the brain of feather; If thou art light and empty Torrismond, The admiration, oath, and patron-saint Of frivolous revellers, he whose corky heart, Pierced by a ragged pen of Cupid's wing, Spins like a vane upon his mother's temple In every silly sigh,—let it play on:— Torris. It is not so; I vow, Veronica— Veron. If you unpeopled the Olympian town Of all its gods, and shut them in one oath, It would not weigh a flue of melting snow In my opinion. Listen thus much more: If thou art otherwise than all have held Except myself; if these, which men do think The workings of thy true concentrate self, Have been indeed but bubbles raised in sport By the internal god, who keeps unseen The fountains of thine undiscovered spirit; If, underneath this troubled scum of follies, Lies what my hopes have guessed:—why guess thy wishes, What it may be unto Veronica. Torris. What need of doubts and guesses? make me firm; With fixed assurance prop my withering hopes, Or tear them up at once: give truth for truth. I know it is the custom to dissemble, Because men's hearts are shallow, and their nature So mean, ill-nurtured, selfish, and debased, They needs must paint and swaddle them in lies, Before the light could bear to look upon them. But as thou art, thus unalloyed and fresh From thy divine creation, soul and body, Tread artifice to dust, and boldly speak Thine innocent resolve. Veron. Thus then I say: As I believe thee steadfast and sincere, (And, if it be not so, God pity me!) I love thee dearly, purely, heartily; So witness heaven, and our own silent spirits! Torris. And by my immortality I swear, With the like honesty, the like to thee, Thou picture of the heavens! Veron. Hark! some one comes:— Now we must part. Henceforth remember thou, How in this azure secresy of night, And with what vows, we here have dedicated Ourselves, and our eternity of being, Unto each other in our maker's presence. Good-night then, Torrismond. Torris. And such to thee, As thou to me hast given, fairest fair! Best good! of thy dear kind most ever dear! [Exeunt severally. Scene IV. An apartment in the ducal palace. Enter the Duke and courtiers. Duke. Yes, was it not enough, good Garcia,— Blood spilt in every street by his wild sword; The reverend citizens pelted with wrongs, Their rights and toil-won honours blown aside, Torn off, and trampled 'neath his drunken foot; The very daughters of the awful church Smeared in their whiteness by his rude attempts; The law thus made a lie even in my mouth; Myself a jest for beer-pot orators; My state dishonoured;—was it not enough To turn a patience, made of ten-years' ice, Into a thunderbolt? Garcia. It was too much: I wonder at your grace's long endurance. Did you ne'er chide him? Duke. No, never in his life: He has not that excuse. My eyes and ears Were frozen-closed. Yet was it not enough That his ill deeds outgrew all name and number, O'er-flowed his years and all men's memories? Gaudentio, I was mild; I bore upon me This world of wrongs, and smiled. But mark you now, How he was grateful.—Tell them, Melchior. Melch. Linked, as it is surmised, with Lutherans, And other rebels 'gainst his father's state, He has not only for their aid obtained From me, the steward of the dukedom, money, But also robbed, most treacherously robbed, By night, and like a thief, the public treasury. Gauden. I'll not believe it; and he is a villain, Ay, and the very thief, that did the thing, Who brings the accusation. Duke. Knave, I think Thou wert my son's accomplice. Melch. Nay, my lord, He says what all would say, and most myself, But that these facts— Gauden. What facts? What witnesses? Who saw? Who heard? Who knows? Duke. Our trusty steward. Gauden. A Spanish Jew! a godless, heartless exile, Whose ear's the echo of the whispering world. Why, if he only knows, and saw, and heard, This Argus-witness, with his blood-hound nose, Who keeps a fairy in his upright ear, Is no more than a black, blind, ugly devil, Nick-named a lie. Duke. Be silent, slave, or dead. I do believe him: Garcia, so dost thou? All honest men, good Melchior, like thyself,— For that thou art, I think, upon my life,— Believe thee too. Melch. It is my humble trust: And, in the confidence of honesty, I pray you pardon this good servant's boldness. (aside) God help the miserable velvet fellow! It seems he has forgot that little story, How he debauched my poor, abandoned sister, And broke my family into the grave.— That's odd; for I exceeding well remember it, Though then a boy. Duke. Gaudentio, thou dost hear Why I forgive thee: but be cautious, sir. Gauden. Cautious,—but honest,—cautious of a villain. Duke. No more!—But see where comes the man we talk of. Leave us together. [Exeunt Courtiers. Enter Torrismond. Torrismond, well met!— Torris. Why then well parted, for I'm going to bed. I'm weary; so, good-night. Duke. Stay; I must speak to you.— Torris. To-morrow then, good father, and all day. But now no more than the old sleepy word, And so again, good-night. Duke. Turn, sir, and stay: I will be brief, as brief as speech can be.— Seek elsewhere a good night: there is none here. This is no home for your good nights, bad son, Who hast made evil all my days to come, Poisoned my age, torn off my beauteous hopes And fed my grave with them.—Oh! thou hast now, This instant, given my death an hundred sinews, And drawn him nearer by a thousand hours. But what of that? You'd sow me like a grain, And from my stalk pick you a ducal crown. But I will live.— Torris. That you may live and prosper Is every day my prayer, my wish, my comfort. But what offence has raised these cruel words? Duke. That I may live, you plot against my life; That I may prosper, you have cured my fortunes Of their encrusted jaundice,—you have robbed me. So, for your prayers and wishes I do thank you; But for your deeds I wish and pray Heaven's vengeance. Torris. Is this your own invention, or—O nature! O love of fathers! could a father hear His offspring thus accused, and yet believe? Believe! Could he endure, and not strike dead, The monster of the lie? Sir, here or there, In you, or your informers, there's a villain, A fiend of falsehood: so beware injustice! Duke. I never was unjust, but when I pardoned Your bloody sins and ravening appetites,— For which Heaven pardon me, as I repent it! But I'll not play at battledore with words. Hear me, young man, in whom I did express The venom of my nature, thus the son, Not of my virtuous will, but foul desires, Not of my life, but of a wicked moment, Not of my soul, but growing from my body, Like thorns or poison on a wholesome tree, The rank excrescence of my tumid sins,— And so I tear thee off: for, Heaven doth know, All gentler remedies I have applied; But to this head thy rankling vice has swelled, That, if thou dwellest in my bosom longer, Thou wilt infect my blood, corrode my heart, And blight my being: therefore, off for ever! Torris. O mother, thou art happy in thy grave! And there's the hell in which my father lies, The serpent that hath swallowed him! Gaudentio rushes in. Gauden. (As he enters, to those without, the other courtiers, who also enter but remain at the side.) Away! Let me come in! . . Now, I beseech you, lords, Put out this anger; lay a night of sleep Upon its head, and let its pulse of fire Flap to exhaustion. Do not, sir, believe This reptile falsehood: think it o'er again, And try him by yourself; thus questioning, Could I, or did I, thus, or such a fault, In my beginning days? There stands before you The youth and golden top of your existence, Another life of yours: for, think your morning Not lost, but given, passed from your hand to his, The same except in place. Be then to him As was the former tenant of your age, When you were in the prologue of your time, And he lay hid in you unconsciously Under his life. And thou, my younger master, Remember there's a kind of god in him, And after heaven the next of thy religion. Thy second fears of God, thy first of man, Are his, who was creation's delegate, And made this world for thee in making thee. Duke. A frost upon thy words, intended dog! Because thy growth has lost its four-legged way And wandered with thee into man's resemblance, Shalt thou assume his rights? Get to thy bed, Or I'll decant thy pretext of a soul, And lay thee, worm, where thou shalt multiply. Sir slave, your gibbet's sown. Torris. Leave him, Gaudentio, My father and your master are not here; His good is all gone hence, he's truly dead; All that belonged to those two heavenly names Are gone from life with him, and changing cast This slough behind, which all abandoned sins Creep into and enliven devilishly. Duke. What! stand I in thy shadow? or has Momus Opened a window 'twixt thy heart and mine? 'Tis plated then! Torris. We talk like fighting boys:— Out on't! I repent of my mad tongue. Come, sir; I cannot love you after this, But we may meet and pass a nodding question— Duke. Never! There lies no grain of sand between My loved and my detested. Wing thee hence, Or thou dost stand to-morrow on a cob-web Spun o'er the well of clotted Acheron, Whose hydrophobic entrails stream with fire; And may this intervening earth be snow, And my step burn like the mid coal of Ætna, Plunging me, through it all, into the core Where in their graves the dead are shut like seeds, If I do not—O but he is my son! If I do not forgive thee then—but hence! Gaudentio, hence with him, for in my eyes He does look demons.— Melch. (to Torrismond.) Come out with me and leave him: You will be cool, to-morrow. Torris. That I shall; Cool as an ice-drop on the skull of Death, For winter is the season of the tomb, And that's my country now. Duke. Away with him! I will not hear.—Where did I leave my book? Or was it music?—Take the beggar out. Is there no supper yet?—O my good Melchior! I'm an eternal gap of misery.— Let's talk of something else. Torris. O father, father! must I have no father, To think how I shall please, to pray for him, To spread his virtues out before my thought, And set my soul in order after them? To dream, and talk of in my dreaming sleep? If I have children, and they question me Of him who was to me as I to them; Who taught me love, and sports, and childish lore; Placed smiles where tears had been; who bent his talk, That it might enter my low apprehension, And laughed when words were lost.—O father, father! Must I give up the first word that my tongue, The only one my heart has ever spoken? Then take speech, thought, and knowledge quite away,— Tear all my life out of the universe, Take of my youth, unwrap me of my years, And hunt me up the dark and broken past Into my mother's womb: there unbeget me; For 'till I'm in thy veins and unbegun, Or to the food returned which made the blood That did make me, no possible lie can ever Unroot my feet of thee. Canst thou make nothing? Then do it here, for I would rather be At home nowhere, than here nowhere at home. Duke. Why ask'st thou me? Hast thou no deeds to undo, No virtues to rebuy, no sins to loose? Catch from the wind those sighs that thou hast caused; Out of large ocean pick the very tears, And set them in their cabinets again. Renew thyself, and then will I remember How thou camest thus. Thou art all vices now Of thine own getting. My son Torrismond Did sow himself under a heap of crime, And thou art grown from him: die to the root, So I may know thee as his grave at least.— Now, Melchior, we'll away. Melch. Not yet, my lord: I wait upon this gentleman. Duke. Is't so? Why then, begone! Good morrow to you, sirs. Farewell! and be that word a road to death Uncrossed by any other! Not a word! [Exit with courtiers: manent Torrismond and Melchior. Melch. Will you not stay? He's gone: but follow not:— There's not a speck of flesh upon his heart! What shall we do? Torris. What shall we do?—why, all. How many things, sir, do men live to do? The mighty labour is to die: we'll do't,— But we'll drive in a chariot to our graves, Wheel'd with big thunder, o'er the heads of men. [Exeunt. Cætera desunt. DRAMATIC SCENES AND FRAGMENTS. I. ERMINIA ABBANDONATA. Erminia and female attendant. Attend. Come lift your head from that sad pillow, lady, Let comfort kiss thee dry. Nay, weep no more: Oh! sure thy brain has emptied all its tears, Thy breast outsighed its passion, leaving room For sleep to pour her sweetness into them, And the cored sleep of sleep, tranquillity, That opens but one window of the soul, And, with her hand on sorrow's face, does keep her Dark in her bed and dayless. Quiet now— Will you take peace? Ermin. Good-night; you must go in: The door of life is shut upon me now; I'm sepulchred alone. Look in the west; Mark you the dusty, weary traveller, That stumbles down the clouds? Attend. I see the sun Silently dying. Ermin. Weep till your sight is found.— I have been one that thought there was a sun, A joyful heat-maker; and, like a child By a brook's side spooning the sparkles out, I caught at his reflection in my soul, And found 'twas water painted with a lie, Cold, bitter water; I have cried it out. Sometimes you may see some one through the clouds Stepping about the sky,—and then, in sooth, He robs some mountain of its child, the day, And lays it at the sea's door: but for that I' the west, 'tis the fat, unwholesome star, The bald fool-planet, that has men upon it, And they nick-name it ‘world.’ And oh! this humpy bastard of the sun, It was my slave, my dog, and in my lap Laid down its load of pleasure every night, And spun me sunshine to delight my eyes,— Carried my cities, and did make me summer, And flower-limbed spring, and groves with shady autumn: But now the whelp rolls up his woody back, And turns it on me, and so trundles down, Leaving this bit of rock for me to live on, And his round shadow to be cold in. Go! Follow the rabble clinging at his heels, Get thee a seat among his rags.—Dost know That Momus picked a burnt-out comet up From Vulcan's floor, and stuck a man upon it; Then, having laught, he flung the wick away, And let the insect feed on planet oil:— What was't? Man and his ball. Attend. O dearest lady! Let not your thoughts find instruments of mirth So on the shore where reason has been wrecked, To lay them in your brain along with grief; For grief and laughter, mingled in the skull, Oft boil to madness. Did you hear my words? Ermin. Ay, comfort was among them,—that's a play-thing For girls, a rattle full of noisy lies To fright away black thoughts, and let the sun In on the breast. For madness, though I hold it Kinder to man's enjoyment than true sense, And I would choose it, if they lay before me, Even as a grape beside an adder's tongue, To squeeze into my thoughts as in a cup, Hating the forked and the bitter truth,— I cannot find it. If my brain were capable Of this dear madness, should it not be now All in a bubble with't? What can make mad, If not the abandonment of one, whose love Is more true life than the veins' crimson sap? Leonigild has cut my heart away, And flung it from him: if I could be so, Should I not be tempestuously mad? Attend. Alas! his cruelty looked like a snake Upon Medusa's temple. Ermin. Had I been waked By torchlight in my eyes, and by a voice That said “your babes are burning, stabbed your husband,— “Room on your bosom for their murderer's kisses!” Why, that to this were tickling to a stab, A pin-wound to an hell-jawed, laughing gash. You saw me spurned by him who was—Oh! was!— What was he? not a father, son, or husband,— Lend me a word.— Attend. Indeed your love was much; Your life but an inhabitant of his. Ermin. Loved him! 'tis not enough; the angels might,— They might think what I mean, but could not speak it. I dreamt it was the day of judgment once, And that my soul, in fear of hidden sins, Went with his stolen body on its shoulders, And stood for him before the judgment seat:— O that I now were damned as I was then! But that same body, that same best-loved soul Cursed, spurned me yesterday. Should I not rave, Rave, my girl, rave? Attend. So most women would, So all would wonder that another did not. Ermin. Why now, I rave not, laugh not, think not, care not; But it is well; so far, I said, 'twas well. Next was I not abandoned on the rock, That I might starve? and then you know I prayed, And when 'twas done, behold! there comes a boat, Climbing about the waves; I thought and said, O bless thee, ocean! hither dost thou come, On the same errand as thy birds returning Unto their hungry nest; thus has sweet nature Sown kindness in thy great, and its small, bosom! And, as I spoke, the waves came sporting on, And laid their burthen, like a pillow, here: Look! it's my brother dead. Should I not rave, Rave, my girl, rave? What comet-dragon is there, That makes the air bleed fire with galloping rage, But should be dove-like in my simile? Attend. Alas! such things, Such sudden pluckings by the heart as these, People the mad-house, and cram up the grave! Ermin. Therefore I laugh: methinks, when I do tell it, That I am supping up a draught of wine. Would you know why there's death, and tears, and blood, And wrenching hearts out by their shrieking roots, Which are more tender than the mailed quick, Or the wet eye-ball? I will tell you this,— But O! be secret as rocks under sea,— When the world draws the winter o'er his head, Capping himself so whitely round his Alp, Muffling his feet with ice, and beds him so; Then underneath the coverlid and cloak He has a poisonous strumpet in his arms, On whom he gets confusion, war, disease, Prodigies, earthquakes, blights: she's in his blood, The hell-wombed witch, hagged and hideous nature! But I'll unwind her.—Nay, I jest, my child: Leave me; seek something—What is it we want? O true! 'tis food: take this, and try the huts. Attend. 'Tis needful truly: I'll procure it quick, And turn the hour back I go upon. A little then, good bye. (Exit. Ermin. Yes, I do see The wronger, and will cut her from my heart,— Pare myself of her utterly. Thou nature, Living or dead, thou influence or thou ruler, I invocate the heaven to hear my charge. Who tied my heart unto Leonigild With gordian love-knots of its thousand strings, Then tore them all away to bleed and wither? Was it not nature? Who quickened next that heart a lovely babe, And when its little smile had learnt its mother, When thought was rising in its heavenly eye, Bade the grave jump and snap it? The same nature. Here lies a brother in my dead embrace, Loved after, as before, his human life; For in each other's unborn arms we lay, Bedfellows in our mother. Who poisoned him, Alone among the horrible sea-waves, And then—O murderess above fratricide, To kill the sister with the brother's corpse!— Sent him a gift to me? Again 'twas nature. I had a husband; nature widowed me:— A child; she kidnapped it to earth a tree:— A brother; him she murdered with her waves:— Me she would madden:—therefore I defy, Curse, and abandon Nature henceforth ever. And, though I cannot creep up to my mother, Or flow back to my father's veins again,— Resex or uncreate me; thus much can I: I will spunge out the sweetness of my heart, And suck up horror; woman's thoughts I'll kill, And leave their bodies rotting in my mind, Hoping their worms will sting; although not man, Yet will I out of hate engender much,— I'll be the father of a world of ghosts, And get the grave with a carcase. For the rest, I will encorpse me in my brother's garments, Pick me a heart out of a devil's side, And so, my own creator, my own child, Tread on the womb of nature, unbegotten. Now then, ye waves, I step on you again, And into my new self, my life outlived: Come back and kneel, thou world; submit thy side, And take me on thy neck again, new-made, Fiend-hearted, woman-corpsed, but man-arrayed. II. AN APOTHEOSIS. Dianeme and female attendants. Dianeme. Sing on, sing ever, and let sobs arise Beneath the current of your harmony, Breaking its silvery stillness into gushes Of stealing sadness: let tears fall upon it, And burst with such a sound, as when a lute-string, Torn by the passion of its melody, Gasps its whole soul of music in one sound, And dies beneath the waves of its own voice! Be pale thou mooned midnight, and ye stars Shed fluttering tremours of inconstant light Upon the moaning billows; timid leaves O'erwhelm yourselves with shadow, and give out Your dewy titterings to the air no more! Clouds, clouds, dark, deadly clouds, let not the moon Look on his grave!—It is too light: the day Will rise before I die: how old is evening? Attend. The tide of darkness now is at its height. Yon lily-woven cradle of the hours Hath floated half her shining voyage, nor yet Is by the current of the morn opposed. Dianeme. The hour is coming: I must give my soul To the same moment on whose precious air My Casimir soared heavenward, for I know There are a million chambers of the dead, And every other minute but the same Would bear me to the one where he is not, And that were madness. Bring me yon sick lily,— Yon fevered one. Attend. Choose any other, lady, For this is broken, odourless, and scorched,— Where Death has graved his curse. Dianeme. Give it to me; I'll weep it full. I have a love for flowers: Guess you not why? Their roots are in the earth, And, when the dead awake, or talk in sleep, These hear their thoughts and write them on their leaves For heaven to look on: and their dews come down From the deep bosom of the blue, whereon The spirits linger, sent by them perchance With blessings to their friends. Besides all night They are wide-waking, and the ghosts will pause, And breathe their thoughts upon them. There, poor blossom, My soul bedews thee, and my breast shall be Thy death-bed, and our deaths shall intertwine. Now, maids, farewell; this is the very echo Of his expiring time; one snowy cloud Hangs, like an avalanche of frozen light, Upon the peak of night's cerulean Alp, And yon still pine, a bleak anatomy, Flows, like a river, on the planet's disk, With its black, wandering arms. Farewell to all: There is my hand to weep on. Now my soul Developes its great beams, and, like a cloud Racked by the mighty winds, at once expands Into a measureless, immortal growth. Crescented night, and amethystine stars, And day, thou god and glory of the heavens, Flow on for ever! Play, ye living spheres, Through the infinity of azure wafted On billowy music! Airs immortal, strew Your tressed beauty on the clouds and seas! And thou the sum of these, nature of all, Thou providence pervading the whole space Of measureless creation; thou vast mind, Whose thoughts these pageantries and seasons are, Who claspest all in one imagination, All hail! I too am an eternity; I am an universe. My soul is bent Into a girdling circle full of days; And my fears rise through the deep sky of it, Blossoming into palpitating stars; And suns are launched, and planets wake within me; The words upon my breath are showery clouds, Sailing along a summer; Casimir Is the clear truth of ocean, to look back The beams of my soft love, the world to turn Within my blue embrace. I am an heaven, And he my breezes, rays, and harmony; 'Round and around the curvous atmosphere Of my own real existence I revolve, Serene and starry with undying love. I am, I have been, I shall be, O glory! An universe, a god, a living Ever. [She dies. III. The Israelite amid Philistines. Enter Ezril dragged in by two Venetians. Ezril. Help! help, you kindly people of this place! Help for the helpless old! Have mercy, sirs! Oh! it is in your hearts, deny it not; Shut not your ears to its enchanting tongue. It will unlock a heaven in your souls, Wherein my pardon and my pity sits. I kneel to you, as you unto your god: Reject me not, teach him not cruelty. Be heavenly, as you can. 1st Venet. Hush! frosty jew! Or take my answer from this tongue of steel. Ezril. When you are old, and fearful, With age's wintry winds shaking your limbs, Thus may you cry, thus may you wring your hands,— 1st Venet. And thus be struck. Once more have silence with thee, Or death possess me if I stab thee not. Now comrade, shall we let the coward live? 2nd Venet. Wilt thou betray us, dotard? Ezril. By my life, If you will grant me it to swear upon, Never! 1st Venet. It is a rubbed and brittle oath, As what 'tis sworn: break one, thou breakest both. I'll snap thy being like a frozen breath, If thou breathest falsely. Ezril. If I kill my truth, Drive thy revenge into my midmost heart. 1st Venet. Hark, once again! Where wert thou journeying, jew, With gold-stuffed panniers, thus? Ezril. To Venice town.— Alas! remind me not of my dear riches, The beauteous jewels of my bosom; take them.— I would that I were stouter in my soul, That I dared die!—Be gentle with the sacks; They're full of fair, white silver: as I tied them, I felt their strings run tickling through my veins. 1st Venet. O ho! here's royal booty, on my soul: A draught of ducats! By this silver sight I love thee, bushy dog, and thou shalt live To sweep the corners of men's souls again. Be comforted. Let's toss them on our shoulders, And swim the Po. 2nd Venet. First, look you here, old man: There's a clenched hand; dost see? Ezril. 'Tis hard as iron: (aside) Hell melt it so! 2nd Venet. And in't a sword:— Ezril. (aside) As sharp as are the teeth Of my heart's father, a fierce curse of thee.— What then, sir? 2nd Venet. Speak once of us, Look after us, or press that foot of thine Upon yon lip of Po, where Venice grows,— They're in thy muddy body to the wrist. [Exeunt Veneti. Ezril. The weight of Atlas' shoulder slip upon you! The waves smile, do they? O, that they would laugh, Open their liquid jaws and shut them on you! These are but thieves, the emptiers of my soul,— These, that have scooped away my sweetest kernel, My gathered seed of kingdom-shading wealth, Crown-blossomed, sword-leaved, trunked with struggling armies, And left the wrinkled skin upon my arms,— These are but thieves! And he that steals the blood, A murderer is he? Oh! my thoughts are blunt:— I'll throw away the workings of my tongue, Till I've the craft to make a curse so long, Fangish enough to reach the quick of earth, That hell whose flaming name my feelings echo, And rouse it for them. Death! here comes a man To stare into my ruin. Enter Marcello. Marcello. Hail, country of my birth! We're met in season; winter in us both, The fruit picked from us, poor and snowy-scalped, And almost solitary. I did turn An ermined shoulder on thee, when I stepped Out of thine airy door of earth and sky, Upon that watery threshold; And now I face thee with a ragged front: A coin of Fate's cross-stamp, that side a Duke, And this, which Time turns up, (so hell might stick Upon the back of heaven,) a scratched despair! IV. Lovers' Identity. Erminia. Is it Zenobio? Zenobio. Ay, that's my body's name, for my dear soul Is not so called: when you would speak of that, Which is myself more than the thing you see, Only say “Erminia.”—And what readeth she, Who called Zenobio? Erminia. An unhappy tale Of two who loved, with so unusual faith, That their affection rose up into heaven, And there was deified: (for the blind child, Whom men of this late world invoke and swear by, Is the usurper of that first love's name, Indeed an idol, a false deity:) —A pedant's dream! Zenobio. We know it to be so. For not externally this love can live, But in the soul, as life within the body: And what is Love alone? Are there not two? —But, dearest, you were telling— Erminia. Of this pair: One from the beauty and the grace of youth, One, innocent and youthful, perished. The other,—what could she, O widowed thing! With but a pale and fading memory Left in the hollow of her heart? Zenobio. What could she? But let her deathly life pass into death, Like music on the night-wind; moaning, moaning, Until it sleeps. Erminia. Worse, worse, much worse than that, Or aught else of despair or common madness. Cheerfully did she live, quietly end A joyous age alone! This is to me More woeful, and more murderous of hope, Than any desperate story. Zenobio. So it would be, If thought on with the general sense of man. But know this surely: in that woman's breast Lived the two souls, that were before divided. For otherwise, be sure, she could not live; But so, much happier than ever. V. Prison Thoughts. Scene, a dungeon: Orazio solus. Orazio. I'll speak again: This rocky wall's great silence frightens me, Like a dead giant's. Methought I heard a sound; but all is still. This empty silence is so deadly low, The very stir and winging of my thoughts Make audible my being: every sense Aches from its depth with hunger. The pulse of time is stopped, and night's blind sun Sheds its black light, the ashes of noon's beams, On this forgotten tower, whose ugly round, Amid the fluency of brilliant morn, Hoops in a blot of parenthetic night, Like ink upon the chrystal page of day, Crossing its joy! But now some lamp awakes, And, with the venom of a basilisk's wink, Burns the dark winds. Who comes? Enter Ezril. Ezril. There's food for thee. Eat heartily; be mirthful with your cup; Though coarse and scanty. Orazio. I'll not taste of it. To the dust, to the air with the cursed liquids And poison-kneaded bread. Ezril. Why dost thou this? Orazio. I know thee and thy master: honey-lipped, Viper-tongued villain, that dost bait intents, As crook'd and murderous as the scorpion's sting, With mercy's sugared milk, and poisonest The sweetest teat of matron charity! VI. Man's petty Universe contrasted with the True. Scene: the abyss of Space: Ambrosius and Cynthia in the car, returning to the earth. Ambrosius loquitur. O what a deep delight it is to cleave, Out-darting thought, above all sight and sound, And sweep the ceiling of the universe, Thus with our locks! How it does mad the heart, How dances it along the living veins, Like hot and steaming wine! How my eyes ache With gazing on this mighty vacancy! O Universe of earth and air and ocean, Which man calls infinite, where art thou now? Sooner a babe should pierce the marble ear Of death, and startle his tombed ancestor, 'Mid Hell's thick laughter, shrieks, and flamy noises, With cradle-pulings, than the gathered voice Of every thunder, ocean, and wild blast, Find thee, thou atom, in this wilderness! This boundless emptiness, this waveless sea, This desert of vacuity, alone Is great: and thou, for whom the word was made, Art as the wren's small goblet of a home Unto the holy vastness of the temple! VII. Recognition. Soft! Stand away! those features—Do not stir! Be breathless if thou canst!.. The trembling ray Of some approaching thought, I know not what, Gleams on my darkened mind. It will be here Directly: now I feel it growing, growing, Like a man's shadow, when the sun floats slowly Through the white border of a baffled cloud: And now the pale conception furls and thickens. 'Tis settled.—Yes—Beroe!—How dare thy cheek Be wan and withered as a wrinkling moon Upon the tumbled waves? Why camest thou here? I dreamt of thee last night, as thou wert once, But I shall never dream of thee again. VIII. Reception of Evil Tidings. What's this? Did you not see a white convulsion Run through his cheek and fling his eye-lids up? There's mischief in the paper. Mark again How, with that open palm, he shades his brain From its broad, sudden meaning. Once I saw One who had dug for treasure in a corner, Where he, by torchlight, saw a trembling man Burying a chest at night. Just so he stood With open striving lips and shaking hair; Alive but in his eyes, and they were fixed On a smeared, earthly, bleeding corpse—his sister, There by her murderer crushed into the earth. IX. A Ruffian. There's a fellow With twisting root-like hair up to his eyes, And they are streaked with red and starting out Under their bristling brows; his crooked tusks Part, like a hungry wolf's, his cursing mouth; His head is frontless, and a swinish mane Grows o'er his shoulders:—brown and warty hands, Like roots, with pointed nails.—He is the man. X. Recollection of Early Life. Leaf after leaf, like a magician's book Turned in a dragon-guarded hermitage By tress-disheveling spirits of the air, My life unfolds. XI. A Crocodile. Hard by the lilied Nile I saw A duskish river-dragon stretched along, The brown habergeon of his limbs enamelled With sanguine almandines and rainy pearl: And on his back there lay a young one sleeping, No bigger than a mouse; with eyes like beads, And a small fragment of its speckled egg Remaining on its harmless, pulpy snout; A thing to laugh at, as it gaped to catch The baulking, merry flies. In the iron jaws Of the great devil-beast, like a pale soul Fluttering in rocky hell, lightsomely flew A snowy troculus, with roseate beak Tearing the hairy leeches from his throat. XII. “Bona de Mortuis.” Ay, ay: good man, kind father, best of friends— These are the words that grow, like grass and nettles, Out of dead men, and speckled hatreds hide, Like toads, among them. XIII. Rosily dying. I'll take that fainting rose Out of his breast; perhaps some sigh of his Lives in the gyre of its kiss-coloured leaves. O pretty rose, hast thou thy flowery passions Then put thyself into a scented rage, And breathe on me some poisonous revenge. For it was I, thou languid, silken blush, Who orphaned thy green family of thee, In their closed infancy: therefore receive My life, and spread it on thy shrunken petals, And give to me thy pink, reclining death. XIV. Speaker's Meaning dimly descried. I know not whether I see your meaning: if I do, it lies Upon the wordy wavelets of your voice, Dim as an evening shadow in a brook, When the least moon has silver on't no larger Than the pure white of Hebe's pinkish nail. XV. Anticipation of Evil Tidings. I fear there is some maddening secret Hid in your words, (and at each turn of thought Comes up a scull,) like an anatomy Found in a weedy hole, 'mongst stones and roots And straggling reptiles, with his tongueless mouth Telling of murder. XVI. Midnight Hymn. And many voices marshalled in one hymn Wound through the night, whose still, translucent moments Lay on each side their breath; and the hymn passed Its long, harmonious populace of words Between the silvery silences, as when The slaves of Egypt, like a wind between The head and trunk of a dismembered king On a strewn plank, with blood and footsteps sealed, Vallied the unaccustomed sea. XVII. Concealed Joy. Just now a beam of joy hung on his eye-lash; But, as I looked, it sunk into his eye, Like a bruised worm writhing its form of rings Into a darkening hole. XVIII. Life a Glass Window. Let him lean Against his life, that glassy interval 'Twixt us and nothing; and, upon the ground Of his own slippery breath, draw hueless dreams, And gaze on frost-work hopes. Uncourteous Death Knuckles the pane, and XIX. A Dream. Last night I looked into a dream; 'twas drawn On the black midnight of a velvet sleep, And set in woeful thoughts; and there I saw A thin, pale Cupid, with bare, ragged wings Like skeletons of leaves, in autumn left, That sift the frosty air. One hand was shut, And in its little hold of ivory Fastened a May-morn zephyr, frozen straight, Made deadly with a hornet's rugged sting, Gilt with the influence of an adverse star. Such was his weapon, and he traced with it, Upon the waters of my thoughts, these words: “I am the death of flowers, and nightingales, And small-lipped babes, that give their souls to summer To make a perfumed day with: I shall come, A death no larger than a sigh to thee, Upon a sunset hour.”—And so he passed Into the place where faded rainbows are, Dying along the distance of my mind; As down the sea Europa's hair-pearls fell When, through the Cretan waves, the curly bull Dashed, tugging at a stormy plough, whose share Was of the northern hurricane— XX. Metaphor of Rain. An amorous cloud Lets down her rustling hair over the sun. XXI. Meditation. The bitter past And the untasted future I mix up, Making the present a dream-figured bowl For the black poison, which is caked and moulded, By the inside of the enchasing thoughts, Even as I taste it. XXII. Sweet to Die. Is it not sweet to die? for, what is death, But sighing that we ne'er may sigh again, Getting at length beyond our tedious selves; But trampling the last tear from poisonous sorrow, Spilling our woes, crushing our frozen hopes, And passing like an incense out of man? Then, if the body felt, what were its sense, Turning to daisies gently in the grave, If not the soul's most delicate delight When it does filtrate, through the pores of thought, In love and the enamelled flowers of song? XXIII. Extreme Acclivity. Its impossible ascent was steep, As are the million pillars of a shower Torn, shivered, and dashed hard against the earth, When Day no longer breathes. XXIV. Rain. The blue, between yon star-nailed cloud The double-mountain and this narrow valley, Is strung with rain, like a fantastic lyre. XXV. Life's Uncertainty. A. The king looks well, red in its proper place The middle of the cheek, and his eye's round Black as a bit of night. B. Yet men die suddenly: One sits upon a strong and rocky life, Watching a street of many opulent years, And Hope's his mason. Well! to-day do this, And so to-morrow; twenty hollow years Are stuffed with action:—lo! upon his head Drops a pin's point of time; tick! quoth the clock, And the grave snaps him. A. Such things may have been; The crevice 'twixt two after-dinner minutes, The crack between a pair of syllables, May sometimes be a grave as deep as 'tis From noon to midnight in the hoop of time. But for this man, his life wears ever steel From which disease drops blunted. If indeed Death lay in the market-place, or were—but hush! See you the tremble of that myrtle bough? Does no one listen? B. Nothing with a tongue: The grass is dumb since Midas, and no Æsop Translates the crow or hog. Within the myrtle Sits a hen-robin, trembling like a star, Over her brittle eggs. A. Is it no more? B. Nought: let her hatch. XXVI. Kisses. Her kisses are Soft as a snow-tuft in the dewless cup Of a redoubled rose, noiselessly falling When heaven is brimful of starry night. XXVII. Subterranean City. Can it then be, that the earth loved some city, Another planet's child, so long, so truly, That here we find its image next her heart, Like an abandoned, melancholy thought? XXVIII. Dream of Dying. Shivering in fever, weak, and parched to sand, My ears, those entrances of word-dressed thoughts, My pictured eyes, and my assuring touch, Fell from me, and my body turned me forth From its beloved abode: then I was dead; And in my grave beside my corpse I sat, In vain attempting to return: meantime There came the untimely spectres of two babes, And played in my abandoned body's ruins; They went away; and, one by one, by snakes My limbs were swallowed; and, at last, I sat With only one, blue-eyed, curled round my ribs, Eating the last remainder of my heart, And hissing to himself. O sleep, thou fiend! Thou blackness of the night! how sad and frightful Are these thy dreams! XXIX. Insignificance of the World. Why what's the world and time? a fleeting thought In the great meditating universe, A brief parenthesis in chaos. XXX. Sleeper's Countenance contemplated. Duke. There smiles methinks A cherished dream, that lies upon her lips As the word love deep written in a rose, With which the story of our youth begins. Could'st thou but see whose image so delights her! Ziba. Her thoughts are far from us in early childhood: For 'tis our wont to dream of distant friends And half-forgotten times. D. I. B. XXXI. A beautiful Night. How lovely is the heaven of this night, How deadly still its earth! The forest brute Has crept into his cave, and laid himself Where sleep has made him harmless like the lamb. The horrid snake, his venom now forgot, Is still and innocent as the honied flower Under his head: and man, in whom are met Leopard and snake, and all the gentleness And beauty of the young lamb and the bud, Has let his ghost out, put his thoughts aside And lent his senses unto death himself. XXXII. Humble Beginnings. Why, Rome was naked once, a bastard smudge, Tumbled on straw, the denfellow of whelps, Fattened on roots, and, when a-thirst for milk, He crept beneath and drank the swagging udder Of Tyber's brave she-wolf; and Heaven's Judea Was folded in a pannier. XXXIII. A Countenance foreboding Evil. Thy gloomy features, like a midnight dial, Scowl the dark index of a fearful hour. XXXIV. A lofty Mind. His thoughts are so much higher than his state, That, like a mountain hanging o'er a hut, They chill and darken it. XXXV. Sorrow. Sorrow! Hast thou seen Sorrow asleep, When thick sighs break the wholeness of her mouth, And one tear trembles in her upward eye, Part clammy on the dark threads of her lash, Part yet within her dream? One moony night I found her so, a pale, cold babe, and beauteous, In slumber, as Consumption, just before She's christened Death. I pressed her in my arms, And took upon my lip the hurrying tear Off her warm neck. XXXVI. Sad and cheerful Songs contrasted. Sing me no more such ditties: they are well For the last gossips, when the snowy wind Howls in the chimney till the very taper Trembles with its blue flame, and the bolted gates Rattle before old winter's palsied hand. If you will sing, let it be cheerily Of dallying love. There's many a one among you Hath sung, beneath our oak trees to his maiden, Light bird-like mockeries, fit for love in spring time. Sing such a one. D. I. B. XXXVII. A subterranean City. I followed once a fleet and mighty serpent Into a cavern in a mountain's side; And, wading many lakes, descending gulphs, At last I reached the ruins of a city, Built not like ours but of another world, As if the aged earth had loved in youth The mightiest city of a perished planet, And kept the image of it in her heart, So dream-like, shadowy, and spectral was it. Nought seemed alive there, and the bony dead Were of another world the skeletons. The mammoth, ribbed like to an arched cathedral, Lay there, and ruins of great creatures else More like a shipwrecked fleet, too vast they seemed For all the life that is to animate: And vegetable rocks, tall sculptured palms, Pines grown, not hewn, in stone; and giant ferns, Whose earthquake-shaken leaves bore graves for nests. D. I. B. XXXVIII. Man's anxious, but ineffectual, Guard against Death. Luckless man Avoids the miserable bodkin's point, And, flinching from the insect's little sting, In pitiful security keeps watch, While 'twixt him and that hypocrite the sun, To which he prays, comes windless pestilence, Transparent as a glass of poisoned water Through which the drinker sees his murderer smiling; She stirs no dust, and makes no grass to nod, Yet every footstep is a thousand graves, And every breath of her's as full of ghosts As a sunbeam with motes. D. I. B. XXXIX. A Day of surpassing Beauty. The earth is bright, her forests all are golden; A cloud of flowers breathes blushing over her, And, whispering from bud to blossom, opens The half-awakened memory of the song She heard in childhood from the mystic sun. There is some secret stirring in the world, A thought that seeks impatiently its word: A crown, or cross, for one is born to day. XL. The slight and degenerate Nature of Man.Antediluvianus loquitur. Pitiful post-diluvians! from whose hearts The print of passions by the tide of hours Is washed away for ever and for ever, As lions' footmark on the ocean sands; While we, Adam's coevals, carry in us The words indelible of buried feelings, Like the millennial trees, whose hoary barks Grow o'er the secrets cut into their core. XLI. A Night-Scene. The lake, like her, heaves gently Its breast of waves under a heaven of sleep, And pictures in its soothed, transparent being The depth of worlds o'erhanging: o'er the pillow, Washed by the overflowing, flowery locks, A silver promise of the moon is breathed: And the light veil of hieroglyphic clouds The curious wind rends ever and anon, Revealing the deep dream of Alpine heights, Which fill the distance of its wondering spirit, And on its hectic cheeks the prophecies Do fearfully reflect, that flicker up Out of the sun's grave underneath the world. XLII. Dirge. No tears, no sighings, no despair, No trembling dewy smile of care, No mourning weeds, Nought that discloses A heart that bleeds; But looks contented I will bear, And o'er my cheeks strew roses. Unto the world I may not weep, But save my sorrow all, and keep A secret heart, sweet soul, for thee, As the great earth and swelling sea— XLIII. Mourners consoled. Dead, is he? What's that further than a word, Hollow as is the armour of a ghost Whose chinks the moon he haunts doth penetrate. Belief in death is the fell superstition, That hath appalled mankind and chained it down, A slave unto the dismal mystery Which old opinion dreams beneath the tombstone. Dead is he, and the grave shall wrap him up? And this you see is he? And all is ended? Ay this is cold, that was a glance of him Out of the depth of his immortal self; This utterance and token of his being His spirit hath let fall, and now is gone To fill up nature and complete her being. The form, that here is fallen, was the engine, Which drew a mighty stream of spiritual power Out of the world's own soul, and made it play In visible motion, as the lofty tower Leads down the animating fire of heaven To the world's use. That instrument is broken, And in another sphere the spirit works, Which did appropriate to human functions A portion of the ghostly element.— This then is all your Death. XLIV. A great Sacrifice self-compensated. True I have had much comfort gazing on thee, Much too perhaps in thinking I might have thee Nearly myself, a fellow soul to live with. But, weighing well man's frail and perilous tenure Of all good in the restless, wavy world, Ne'er dared I set my soul on any thing Which but a touch of time can shake to pieces. Alone in the eternal is my hope. Took I thee? that intensest joy of love Would soon grow fainter and at last dissolve. But, if I yield thee, there is something done Which from the crumbling earth my soul divorces, And gives it room to be a greater spirit. There is a greater pang, methinks, in nature When she takes back the life of a dead world, Than when a new one severs from her depth Its bright, revolving birth. So I'll not hoard thee, But let thee part, reluctant, though in hope That greater happiness will thence arise. XLV. “Love is wiser than Ambition.” Amala. O give not up the promise of your time For me: for what? an evanescent woman, A rose-leaf scarce unfolded ere it falls. Your days Should be a wood of laurels evergreen: Seek glory! Athulf. Glory! To be sung to tuneless harps! A picture, and a name; to live for death! Seek glory? Never. The world's gossip Fame Is busy in the market-place, the change, At court or wrangling senate, noting down Him of the fattest purse, the fabulous crest, The tongue right honied or most poisonous. If Glory goes among the bristling spears, Which war is mowing down; or walks the wave, When Fate weighs kingdoms in their battle-fleets; Or watches the still student at his work, Reading the laws of nature in the heavens, Or earth's minutest creature; she may find me: If not, I am contented with oblivion, As all the other millions. My sweet fair, One little word of confidence and love, From lips beloved, thrilleth more my heart Than brightest trumpet-touch of statued Fame. My bird of Paradise, tell me some news Of your own home. Amala. My home should be your heart: What shall I tell of that? Athulf. Can you not see? Surely the love that burns before thy image, As sunny as a burning diamond, Must shed its light without. D. I. B. XLVI. The Murderer's haunted Couch. Isbr. So buckled tight in scaly resolution, Let my revenge tread on, and, if its footsteps Be graves, the peering eye of critic doubt, All dazzled by the bold, reflected day, May take the jaws of darkness that devour My swift sword's flash, as ravening serpent's famine Locks up birds' sunny life in black eclipse, For pity's dewy eyelid closing over Love's sparkles. I have seen the mottled tigress Sport with her cubs as tenderly and gay, As lady Venus with her kitten Cupids; And flowers, my sagest teachers, beautiful, Or they were fools, because death-poisonous: And lies, methinks, oft brighten woman's lips, And tears have the right pearly run and diamond shoot When they bowl down false oaths. World, I will win thee; Therefore I must deceive thee, gentle World. Let Heaven look in upon my flaming wrath As into Ætna's hell: the sides man sees I clothe with olives, promising much peace. But what's this talk? Must I be one of those That cannot keep a secret from himself? The worst of confidants, who oft goes mad, Through bites of conscience, after many years. I came to see thee, brother: there thou art Even in this suit, from which no blood, save his, This purple doffed by thy imperial life Shall wash away. To the amazed foe I will appear thyself returned, and smite him Ere he has time to doubt or die of horror. I would I were, thus iron-hooped and sworded, Thy murderer's dream this night, to cry, Awake! Awake, Duke Melveric! Duke Murderer! Wrap thee up quickly in thy winding sheet, Without ado! The hearse is at the door, The widest gate of Hell is open for thee, And mighty goblins summon thee to Death.— Come down with me! [he seizes the sleeping Duke. Nay, I will shake thy sleep off, Until thy soul falls out. What voice more dreadful Than one at midnight, blood-choaked, crying murder? Why, Murder's own! His murder's, and now thine! But cheer up. I will let thy blood flow on Within its pipes to-night. Duke. Angel of Death! Can it be? No, 'tis a grave-digging vision: The world is somewhere else. Yet even this Methought I dreamt, and now it stands beside me, Rattling in iron. Isbr. Ay, the murderer's vision Is ever so: for at the word, “I'm murdered,” The gaolers of the dead throw back the grave-stone, Split the deep ocean, and unclose the mountain, And let the buried pass. I am more real Than any airy spirit of a dream, As Death is mightier, stronger, and more faithful To man, than Life. Duke. Wolfram!—Nay thy grasp Is warm, thy bosom heaves, thou breath'st, imposter— Let iron answer iron, flesh crush flesh; Thou art no spirit, fool. Isbr. Fool, art thou murderer, My murderer, Wolfram's? To the blood-stained hand The grave gives way: to the eye, that saw its victim Sigh off the ravished soul, th'horrid world of ghosts Is no more viewless; day and night 'tis open, Gazing on pale and bleeding spectres ever. Come, seat thee; no vain struggle. Write thou here, (And with my blood I trace it on thy brain,) Thy sentence; which by night, in types of fire, Shall stand before thee, never to be closed,— By night the voice of blood shall whisper to thee, Word slowly after word, and ne'er be silent. Melveric, thy conscience I will sing to sleep With softest hymnings; thou shalt not despair, But live on and grow older than all men, To all men's dread: like an old, haunted mountain, Icy and hoary, shalt thou stand 'mid life; And midnight tales be told in secret of thee, As of crime's beacon. Thou shalt see thy son Fall for a woman's love, as thy friend fell, Beneath the stabs of him, with whom together He was at one breast suckled. Thou shalt lose Friends, subjects, crown, strength, health and all power, Even despair: thou shalt not dare to break All men's contempt, thy life, for fear of worse: Nor shalt thou e'er go mad for misery. Write on. I leave the voice with thee, that never Shall cease to read thee, o'er and o'er, thy doom. It will the rest, the worst of all, repeat Till it be written. Thou art doomed: no trumpet Shall wake the bravery of thy heart to battle; No song of love, no beam of child's glad eye, Drown that soft whisper, dazzle from thy sight Those words indelible. Follow him, dearest curse; Be true to him, invisible to others, As his own soul. [Exit. Duke. Hold! mercy! . . . 'Tis enough . . . Curse shoulders curse, as in a bloody river. I will no more. D. I. B. XLVII. Human Life: its value. Think, what I plead for: for a life! the gift Of God alone, whom he, who saves't, is likest. How glorious to live! Even in one thought The wisdom of past-times to fit together, And from the luminous minds of many men Catch a reflected truth; as, in one eye, Light, from unnumbered worlds and furthest planets Of the star-crowded universe, is gathered Into one ray.— D. I. B. MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. ALFARABI; THE WORLD-MAKER. A rhapsodical fragment. 'Twas in those days That never were, nor ever shall be, reader, But on this paper; golden, glorious days, Such as the sun, (poor fellow! by the way, Where is he? I've not seen him all this winter,)— Never could spin: days, as I said before, Which shall be made as fine as ink can make them; So, clouds, avaunt! and Boreas, hence! to blow Old Ætna's porridge. We will make the sun Rise, like a gentleman, at noon; clasped round With the bright armour of his May-day beams; The summer-garland on his beaming curls, With buds of palest brightness; and one cloud— Yes, (I'm an Englishman,) one snow-winged cloud, To wander slowly down the trembling blue; A wind that stops and pants along the grass, Trembles and flies again, like thing pursued; And indescribable, delightful sounds, Which dart along the sky, we know not whence; Bees we must have to hum, shrill-noted swallows With their small, lightning wings, to fly about, And tilt against the waters:—that will do. And now, dear climate, only think what days I'd make if you'd employ me: you should have A necklace, every year, of such as this; Each bead of the three hundred sixty five— (Excuse me, puss, (&amp;) I could'nt get you in,) Made up of sunshine, moonshine, and blue skies: Starlight I'd give you in:—but where are we? I see: 'twas in those days that Alfarabi lived; A man renowned in the newspapers: He wrote in two reviews; raw pork at night He ate, and opium; kept a bear at college: A most extraordinary man was he. But he was one not satisfied with man, As man has made himself: he thought this life Was something deeper than a jest, and sought Into its roots: himself was his best science. He touched the springs, the unheeded hieroglyphics Deciphered; like an antiquary sage Within an house of office, which he takes For druid temple old, here he picked up A tattered thought, and turned it o'er and o'er 'Till it was spelled; the names of all the tenants, Pencilled upon the wall, he would unite; Until he found the secret and the spell Of life. 'Twas not by Logic, reader; Her and her crabbed sister, Metaphysics, Left he to wash Thought's shirt, the shirt bemired On that proverbial morning. By his own mind, The lamp that never fails us, dared we trust it, He read the mystery; and it was one To the dull sense of common man unknown, Incomprehensible; a miracle Of magic, yet as true and obvious, For thoughtful ones to hit on, as the sun. He knew the soul would free itself in sleep From her dull sister, bear itself away, Freer than air: to guide it with his will, To bear his mortal sight and memory, On these excursions, was the power he found. He found it, and he used it. For, one night, By the internal vision he saw Sleep, Just after dinner, tapping at the door Of his next neighbour, the old alderman. Sleep rode a donkey with a pair of wings, And, having fastened its ethereal bridle Unto the rails, walked in. Now, Alfarabi! Leap, Alfarabi! There! the saddle's won: He kicks, he thwacks, he spurs,—the donkey flies. On soared they, like the bright thought of an eye, 'Mid the infinity of elements. First through the azure meads of night and day, Among the rushing of the million flames, They passed the bearded dragon-star, unchained From Hell, (of old its sun,) flashing its way Upon those wings, compact of mighty clouds Bloodshot and black, or flaring devilish light, Whose echo racks the shrieking universe, Whose glimpse is tempest. O'er each silent star Slept like a tomb that dark, marmoreal bird, That spell-bound ocean, Night,—her breast o'erwrit With golden secresies. All these he passed, One after one: as he, who stalks by night, With the ghost's step, the shaggy murderer Leaves passed the dreamy city's sickly lamps. Then through the horrid twilight did they plunge, The universe's suburbs; dwelling dim Of all that sin and suffer; midnight shrieks Upon the water, when no help is nigh; The blood-choaked curse of him who dies in bed By torch-light, with a dagger in his heart; The parricidal and incestuous laugh; And the last cries of those whom devils hale Quick into hell; deepened the darkness. And there were sounds of wings, broken and swift; Blows of wrenched poniards, muffled in thick flesh; Struggles and tramplings wild, splashes and falls, And inarticulate yells from human breasts. Nought was beheld: but Alfarabi's heart Turned in his bosom, like a scorched leaf, And his soul faded. When again he saw, His steed had paused. It was within a space Upon the very boundary and brim Of the whole universe, the outer edge Which seemed almost to end the infinite zone; A chasm in the almighty thoughts, forgotten By the omnipotent; a place apart, Like some great, ruinous dream of broken worlds Tumbling through heaven, or Tartarus' panting jaws Open above the sun. Sky was there none, Nor earth, nor water: but confusion strange; Mountainous ribs and adamantine limbs Of bursten worlds, and brazen pinions vast Of planets ship-wrecked; many a wrinkled sun Ate to the core by worms, with lightnings crushed; And drossy bolts, melting like noonday snow. Old towers of heaven were there, and fragments bright Of the cerulean battlements, o'erthrown When the gods struggled for the throne of light; And 'mid them all a living mystery, A shapeless image, or a vision wrapt In clouds, and guessed at by its fearful shade; Most like a ghost of the eternal flame, An indistinct and unembodied horror Which prophecies have told of; not wan Death, Nor War the bacchanal of blood, nor Plague The purple beast, but their great serpent-sire, Destruction's patriarch, (dread name to speak!) The End of all, the Universe's Death. At that dread, ghostly thing, the atmosphere And light of this, the world's, black charnel house, Low bowed the Archimage, and thrice his life Upraised its wing for passage; but the spell Prevailed, and to his purposed task he rose. He called unto the dead, and the swart powers, That wander unconfined beyond the sight Or thought of mortals; and, from the abyss Of cavernous deep night, came forth the hands, That dealt the mallet when this world of ours Lay quivering on the anvil in its ore,— Hands of eternal stone, which would unmesh And fray this starry company of orbs, As a young infant, on a dewy morn, Rends into nought the tear-hung gossamer. —To work they went, magician, hands, and Co, With tongs and trowels, needles, scissors, paste, Solder and glue, to make another world: And, as a tinker, 'neath a highway hedge, Turns, taps, and batters, rattles, bangs, and scrapes A stew-pan ruinous,—or as, again, The sibylline dame Gurton, ere she lost Th'immortal bodkin, staunched the gaping wound In Hodge's small-clothes famed,—so those great hands Whisked round their monstrous loom, here stitching in An island of green vallies, fitting there A mountain extra with a hook and eye, Caulking the sea, hemming the continents, And lacing all behind to keep it tight. 'Tis done,—'tis finished; and between the thumb Depends, and the forefinger,—like a toy, Button with pin impaled, in winter games That dances on the board,—and now it flies Into the abyssal blueness, spinning and bright, Just at old Saturn's tail. The necromancer Puffed from his pipe a British climate round, And stars and moon, and angels beamed upon it. Just as it joined the midnight choir of worlds, It chanced a bearded sage espied it's sweep, And named it Georgium Sidus. THE ROMANCE OF THE LILY. Ever love the lily pale, The flower of ladies' breasts; For there is passion on its cheek, Its leaves a timorous sorrow speak, And its perfume sighs a gentle tale To its own young buds, and the wooing gale, And the piteous dew that near it rests. It is no earthly common flower For man to pull, and maidens wear On the wreathed midnight of their hair. Deep affection is its dower; For Venus kissed it as it sprung, And gave it one immortal tear, When the forgotten goddess hung, Woe-bowed o'er Adon's daisied bier: Its petals, brimmed with cool sweet air, Are chaste as the words of a virgin's prayer; And it lives alight in the greenwood shade, Like a love-thought, chequered o'er with fear, In the memory of that self-same maid. I ever have loved the lily pale, For the sake of one whom heaven has ta'en From the prison of man, the palace of pain. In autumn, Mary, thou didst die; (Die! no, thou didst not—but some other way Wentest to bliss; she could not die like men; Immortal into immortality She went; our sorrows know she went:) and then We laid her in a grassy bed (The mortal her) to live for ever, And there was nought above her head, No flower to bend, no leaf to quiver. At length, in spring, her beauty dear, Awakened by my well-known tear, And at its thrill returning, Or her love and anguish burning, Wrought spells within the earth; For a human bloom, a baby flower, Uprose in talismanic birth; Where foliage was forbid to wave, Engendered by no seed or shower, A lily grew on Mary's grave. Last eve I lay by that blossom fair, Alone I lay to think and weep; An awe was on the fading hour: And 'midst the sweetness of the flower There played a star of plumage rare, A bird from off the ebon trees, That grow o'er midnight's rocky steep; One of those whose glorious eyes, In miriads sown, the restless sees, And thinks what lustrous dew there lies Upon the violets of the skies:— And to itself unnumbered ditties Sang that angel nightingale, Secrets of the heavenly cities; And many a strange and fearful word, Which in her arbour she had heard, When the court of seraphs sate To seal some ghost's eternal fate; And the wind, beneath whose current deep My soul was pillowed in her sleep, Thus breathed the mystic warbler's tale.— King Balthasar has a tower of gold, And rubies pave his hall; A magic sun of diamond blazes Above his palace wall; And beaming spheres play round in mazes, With locks of incense o'er them rolled. Young Balthasar is the Libyan king, The lord of wizard sages; He hath read the sun, he hath read the moon,— Heaven's thoughts are on their pages; He knows the meaning of night and noon, And the spell on morning's wing: The ocean he hath studied well, Its maddest waves he hath subdued Beneath an icy yoke, And lashed them till they howled, and spoke The mysteries of the Titan brood, And all their god forbade them tell. He hath beheld the storm, When the phantom of its form Leans out of heaven to trace, Upon the earth and sea, And air's cerulean face, In earthquake, thunder, war, and fire, And pestilence, and madness dire, That mighty woe, futurity. From the roof of his tower he talks to Jove, As the god enthroned sits above: Night roosts upon his turret's height, And the sun is the clasp of its girdle of light; And the stars upon his terrace dwell:— But the roots of that tower are snakes in hell. Balthasar's soul is a curse and a sin, And nothing is human that dwells within, But a tender, beauteous love, That grows upon his haunted heart, Like a scented bloom on a madhouse-wall; For, amid the wrath and roar of all, It gathers life with blessed art, And calmly blossoms on above. Bright Sabra, when thy thoughts are seen Moving within those azure eyes, Like spirits in a star at e'en; And when that little dimple flies, As air upon a rosy bush, To hide behind thy fluttering blush; When kisses those rich lips unclose, And love's own music from them flows; A god might love,—a demon does. —'Tis night upon the sprinkled sky, And on their couch of roses The king and lady lie, While the tremulous lid of each discloses A narrow streak of the living eye; As when a beetle, afloat in the sun, On a rocking leaf, has just begun To sever the clasp of his outer wing, So lightly, that you scarce can see His little, lace pinions' delicate fold, And a line of his body of breathing gold, Girt with many a panting ring, Before it quivers, and shuts again, Like a smothered regret in the breast of men, Or a sigh on the lips of chastity. One bright hand, dawning through her hair, Bids it be black, itself as fair As the cold moon's palest daughter, The last dim star, with doubtful ray Snow-like melting into day, Echoed to the eye on water: Round his neck and on his breast The other curls, and bends its bell Petalled inward as it fell, Like a tented flower at rest. She dreams of him, for rayed joys hover In dimples round her timorous lip, And she turns to clasp her sleeping lover, Kissing the lid of his tender eye, And brushing off the dews that lie Upon its lash's tip; And now she stirs no more,— But the thoughts of her breast are still, As a song of a frozen rill Which winter spreads his dark roof o'er. In the still and moony hour Of that calm entwining sleep, From the utmost tombs of earth The vision-land of death and birth, Came a black, malignant power, A spectre of the desert deep: And it is Plague, the spotted fiend, the drunkard of the tomb; Upon her mildewed temples the thunderbolts of doom, And blight-buds of hell's red fire, like gory wounds in bloom, Are twisted for a wreath; And there's a chalice in her hand, whence bloody flashes gleam, While struggling snakes with arrowy tongues twist o'er it for a steam, And its liquor is of Phlegethon, and Ætna's wrathful stream, And icy dews of death. Like a rapid dream she came, And vanished like the flame Of a burning ship at sea, But to his shrinking lips she pressed The cup of boiling misery, And he quaffed it in his tortured rest, And woke in the pangs of lunacy. As a buried soul awaking From the cycle of its sleep, Panic-struck and sad doth lie Beneath its mind's dim canopy, And marks the stars of memory breaking From 'neath oblivion's ebbing deep, While clouds of doubt bewilder the true sky,— So in the hieroglyphic portal Of his dreams sate Balthasar, Awake amidst his slumbering senses, And felt as feels man's ghost immortal, Whom the corpse's earthen fences From his vast existence bar. The pestilence was in his breast, And boiled and bubbled o'er his brain; His thoughtless eyes in their unrest Would have burst their circling chain, Scattering their fiery venom wide, But for the soft, endearing rain, With which the trembler at his side Fed those gushing orbs of white, As evening feeds the waves, with looks of quiet light. The tear upon his cheek's fierce flush; The cool breath on his brow; And the healthy presage of a blush, Sketched in faint tints behind his skin; And the hush of settling thoughts within, Sabra hath given, and she will need them now. For, as the echo of a grove Keeps its dim shadow 'neath some song of love, And gives her life away to it in sound, Soft spreading her wild harmony, Like a tress of smoking censery, Or a ring of water round,— So all the flowery wealth Of her happiness and health Untwined from Sabra's strength, and grew Into the blasted stem of Balthasar's pale life, And his is the beauty and bliss that flew On the wings of her love from his sinking wife. The fading wanness of despair Was the one colour of her cheek, And tears upon her bosom fair Wrote the woe she dared not speak; But life was in her. Yes: it played In tremulous and fitful grace, Like a flame's reflected breath Shivering in the throes of death Against the monumental face Of some sad, voiceless marble maid. And what is a woman to Balthasar, Whom love has weakened, bowed, and broken? Upon his forehead's darksome war, His lip's curled meaning, yet unspoken, The lowering of his wrinkled brow, 'Tis graved,—he spurns, he loaths her now. Along the sea, at night's black noon, Alone the king and lady float, With music in a snowy boat, That glides in light, an ocean-moon; From billow to billow it dances, And the spray around it glances, And the mimic rocks and caves, Beneath the mountains of the waves, Reflect a joyous song As the merry bark is borne along; And now it stays its eager sail Within a dark sepulchral vale, Amid the living Alps of Ocean, 'Round which the crags in tumult rise And make a fragment of the skies; Beneath whose precipice's motion The folded dragons of the deep Lie with lidless eyes asleep: It pauses; and—Is that a shriek That agonizes the still air, And makes the dead day move and speak From beneath its midnight pall,— Or the ruined billow's fall? The boat is soaring lighter there, The voice of woman sounds no more.— That night the water-crescent bore Dark Balthasar alone unto the living shore. Tears, tears for Sabra; who will weep? O blossoms, ye have dew, And grief-dissembling storms might strew Thick-dropping woe upon her sleep. False sea, why dost thou look like sorrow, Why is thy cold heart of water? Or rather why are tears of thee Compassionless, bad sea? For not a drop does thy stern spirit borrow, To mourn o'er beauty's fairest daughter. Heaven, blue heaven, thou art not kind, Or else the sun is not thine eye, For thou should'st be with weeping blind, Not thus forgetful, bright, and dry. O that I were a plume of snow, To melt away and die In a long chain of bubbling harmony!— My tribute shall be sweet tho' small; A cup of the vale-lily bloom Filled with white and liquid woe— Give it to her ocean-pall: With such deluge-seeds I'll sow Her mighty, elemental tomb, Until the lamentations grow Into a foaming crop of populous overflow. Hither, like a bird of prey, Whom red anticipations feed, Flaming along the fearful day Revenge's thirsty hour doth fly. Heaven has said a fearful word; (Which hell's eternal labyrinths heard, And the wave of time Shall answer to the depths sublime, Reflecting it in deed;) “Balthasar the king must die.” Must die; for all his power is fled, His spells dissolved, his spirits gone, And magic cannot ease the bed Where lies the necromant alone. What thought is gnawing in his heart, What struggles madly in his brain? See, the force, the fiery pain Of silence makes his eyeballs start. O ease thy bosom, dare to tell— But grey-haired pity speaks in vain; That bitter shriek, that hopeless yell, Has given the secret safe to hell. Like a ruffled nightingale, Balanced upon dewy wings, Through the palace weeps the tale, Leaving tears, where'er she sings: And, around the icy dead, Maids are winding Kingly robes of mocking lead, And with leafy garlands binding The unresisting, careless head: Gems are flashing, garments wave 'Round the bridegroom of the grave. Hark! A shout of wild surprise, A burst of terrible amaze! The lids are moving up his eyes, They open, kindle, beam, and gaze.— Grave, thy bars are broken, Quenched the flames of pain, Falsely fate hath spoken, The dead is born again. As when the moon and shadows' strife, On some rebellious night, Looks a pale statue into life, And gives his watching form the action of their light,— So stilly strode the awakened one, And with the voice of stone, Which troubled caverns screech, Cursing the tempest's maniac might, He uttered human speech. “Tremble, living ones, and hear; By the name of death and fear, By lightning, earthquake, fire and war, And him whose snakes and hounds they are, From whose judgment-seat I come, Listen, crouch, be dumb. My soul is drowned beneath a flood Of conscience, red with Sabra's blood; And, from yon blue infinity, Doomed and tortured I am sent To confess the deed and fly: Wail not for me,—yourselves repent: Eternity is punishment; Listen, crouch, and die.” With that word his body fell, As dust upon the storm,— Flash-like darkened was his form; While through their souls in horror rang The dragon-shout, the thunderous clang Of the closing gates of hell. PYGMALION. There stood a city along Cyprus' side Lavish of palaces, an arched tide Of unrolled rocks; and, where the deities dwelled, Their clustered domes pushed up the noon, and swelled With the emotion of the god within,— As doth earth's hemisphere, when showers begin To tickle the still spirit at its core, Till pastures tremble and the river-shore Squeezes out buds at every dewy pore. And there were pillars, from some mountain's heart, Thronging beneath a wide, imperial floor That bent with riches; and there stood apart A palace, oft accompanied by trees, That laid their shadows in the galleries Under the coming of the endless light, Net-like;—who trod the marble, night or day, By moon, or lamp, or sunless day-shine white, Would brush the shaking, ghostly leaves away, Which might be tendrils or a knot of wine, Burst from the depth of a faint window-vine, With a bird pecking it: and round the hall And wandering staircase, within every wall Of sea-ward portico, and sleeping chamber, Whose patient lamp distilled a day of amber, There stood, and sate, or made rough steeds their throne, Immortal generations wrung from stone, Alike too beautiful for life and death, And bodies that a soul of mortal breath Would be the dross of. Such a house as this Within a garden hard by Salamis, (Cyprus's city-crown and capital Ere Paphos was, and at whose ocean-wall Beauty and love's paternal waves do beat That sprouted Venus;) such a fair retreat Lonely Pygmalion self inhabited, Whose fiery chisel with creation fed The ship-wrecked rocks; who paid the heavens again Diamonds for ice; who made gods who make men. Lonely Pygmalion: you might see him go Along the streets where markets thickest flow, Doubling his gown across his thinking breast, And the men fall aside; nor only pressed Out of his elbows' way, but left a place, A sun-room for him, that his mind had space And none went near; none in his sweep would venture, For you might feel that he was but the centre Of an inspired round, the middle spark Of a great moon, setting aside the dark And cloudy people. As he went along The chambered ladies silenced the half-song, And let the wheel unheeded whirl and skim, To get their eyes blest by the sight of him. So locks were swept from every eye that drew Sun for the soul through circles violet-blue, Mild brown, or passionate black. Still, discontent, Over his sensual kind the sculptor went, Walking his thoughts. Yet Cyprus' girls be fair; Day-bright and evening-soft the maidens are, And witching like the midnight, and their pleasure Silent and deep as midnight's starry treasure. Lovely and young, Pygmalion yet loved none. His soul was bright and lovely as the sun, Like which he could create; and in its might There lived another Spirit wild and bright, That came and went; and, when it came, its light On these dim earthy things, turn where he will, Its light, shape, beauty were reflected still. Day-time and dark it came; like a dim mist Shelling a god, it rolled, and, ere he wist, It fell aside, and dawned a shape of grace, And an inspired and melancholy face, Whose lips were smile-buds dewy:—into him It rolled like sun-light till his sight was dim, And it was in his heart and soul again, Not seen but breathed. There was a grassy plain, A pasture of the deer,—Olympus' mountain Was the plain's night, the picture of its fountain: Unto which unfrequented dell and wood Unwittingly his solitary mood Oft drew him.—In the water lay A fragment of pale marble, which they say Slipped from some fissure in the agued moon, Which had caught earth-quake and a deadly swoon When the sun touched her with his hilly shade. Weeds grew upon it, and the streamlet made A wanton music with its ragged side, And birds had nests there. One still even-tide, When they were perched and sleeping, passed this man, Startling the air with thoughts which over-ran The compass of his mind: writing the sand Idly he paused, and laid unwitting hand On the cold stone. How smooth the touch! It felt Less porous than a lip which kisses melt, And diamond-hard. That night his workmen wrought With iron under it, and it was brought, This dripping quarry, while the sky was starry, Home to the weary, yearning statuary. He saw no sky that day, no dark that night, For through the hours his lamp was full of light, Shadowing the pavement with his busy right. Day after day they saw not in the street The wondrous artist: some immortal feat Absorbed him; and yet often in the noon, When the town slept beneath the sweltering June, —The rich within, the poor man on the stair,— He stole unseen into the meadow's air, And fed on sight of summer, till the life Was too abundant in him; and so, rife With light creative, he went in alone, And poured it warm upon the growing stone. The magic chisel thrust, and gashed, and swept, Flying and manifold; no cloud e'er wept So fast, so thick, so light upon the close Of shapeless green it meant to make a rose:— And as insensibly out of a stick, Dead in the winter-time, the dew-drops quick, And the thin sun-beams, and the airy shower Raise and unwrap a many-leaved flower, And then a fruit: so from the barren stock Of the deer-shading, formless valley-rock, This close stone-bud, he, quiet as the air, Had shaped a lady wonderfully fair, —Dear to the eyes, a delicate delight,— For all her marble symmetry was white As brow and bosom should be, save some azure Which waited for a loving lip's erasure, Upon her shoulder, to be turned to blush. And she was smooth and full, as if one gush Of life had washed her, or as if a sleep Lay on her eye-lid, easier to sweep Than bee from daisy. Who could help a sigh At seeing a beauty stand so lifelessly, But that it was too beautiful to die? Dealer of immortality, Greater than Jove himself,—for only he Can such eternize as the grave has ta'en, And open heaven by the gate of pain,— What art thou now, divine Pygmalion? Divine! gods counting human. Thou hast done That glory, which has undone thee for ever. For thou art weak, and tearful, and dost shiver Wintrily sad; and thy life's healthy river, With which thy body once was overflown, Is dried and sunken to its banks of bone. He carved it not; nor was the chisel's play, That dashed the earthen hindrances away, Driven and diverted by his muscle's sway. The winged tool, as digging out a spell, Followed a magnet wheresoe'er it fell, That sucked and led it right: and for the rest, The living form, with which the stone he blest, Was the loved image stepping from his breast. And therefore loves he it, and therefore stays About the she-rock's feet, from hour to hour, Anchored to her by his own heart: the power Of the isle's Venus therefore thus he prays. “Goddess, that made me, save thy son, and save The man, that made thee goddess, from the grave. Thou know'st it not; it is a fearful coop Dark, cold, and horrible,—a blinded loop In Pluto's madhouse' green and wormy wall. O save me from't! Let me not die, like all; For I am but like one: not yet, not yet, At least not yet; and why? My eyes are wet With the thick dregs of immature despair; With bitter blood out of my empty heart. I breathe not aught but my own sighs for air, And my life's strongest is a dying start. No sour grief there is to me unwed; I could not be more lifeless being dead. Then let me die. . Ha! did she pity me? Oh! she can never love. Did you not see, How still she bears the music of my moan! Her heart? Ah! touch it. Fool! I love the stone. Inspire her, gods! oft ye have wasted life On the deformed, the hideous, and the vile: Oh! grant it my sweet rock,—my only wife. I do not ask it long: a little while,— A year,—a day,—an hour,—let it be! For that I'll give you my eternity. Or let it be a fiend, if ye will send Something, yon form to humanize and bend, Within those limbs,—and, when the new-poured blood Flows in such veins, the worst must soon be good. They will not hear. Thou, Jove,—or thou, Apollo— Ay, thou! thou know'st,—O listen to my groan 'Twas Niobe thou drov'st from flesh to stone: Shew this the hole she broke, and let her follow That mother's track of steps and eyelid rain, Treading them backwards into life again. Life, said I? Lives she not? Is there not gone My life into her, which I pasture on; Dead, where she is not? Live, thou statue fair, Live, thou dear marble,—or I shall go wild. I cover thee, my sweet; I leave thee there, Behind this curtain, my delicious child, That they may secretly begin to give My prayer to thee: when I return, O live! Oh! live,—or I live not.” And so he went, Leaving the statue in its darksome tent. Morn after morn, sadder the artist came; His prayer, his disappointment were the same. But when he gazed she was more near to woman; There was a fleshy pink, a dimple wrought That trembled, and the cheek was growing human With the flushed distance of a rising thought, That still crept nearer:—yet no further sign! And now, Pygmalion, that weak life of thine Shakes like a dew-drop in a broken rose, Or incense parting from the altar-glows. 'Tis the last look,—and he is mad no more: By rule and figure he could prove at large She never can be born,—and from the shore His foot is stretching into Charon's barge. Upon the pavement ghastly is he lying, Cold with the last and stoniest embrace: Elysium's light illumines all his face; His eyes have a wild, starry grace Of heaven, into whose depth of depths he's dying. —A sound, with which the air doth shake, Extinguishing the window of moonlight! A pang of music dropping round delight, As if sweet music's honiest heart did break! Such a flash, and such a sound, the world Is stung by, as if something was unfurled That held great bliss within its inmost curled. Roof after roof, the palace rends asunder; And then—O sight of joy and placid wonder! He lies, beside a fountain, on the knee Of the sweet woman-statue, quietly Weeping the tears of his felicity. LINES WRITTEN IN A BLANK LEAF OF THE ‘PROMETHEUS UNBOUND.’ Write it in gold—A spirit of the sun, An intellect a-blaze with heavenly thoughts, A soul with all the dews of pathos shining, Odorous with love, and sweet to silent woe With the dark glories of concentrate song, Was sphered in mortal earth. Angelic sounds Alive with panting thoughts sunned the dim world. The bright creations of an human heart Wrought magic in the bosoms of mankind. A flooding summer burst on poetry; Of which the crowning sun, the night of beauty, The dancing showers, the birds, whose anthems wild Note after note unbind the enchanted leaves Of breaking buds, eve, and the flow of dawn, Were centred and condensed in his one name As in a providence,—and that was Shelley. Oxford, 1822. SONNET: TO TARTAR, A TERRIER BEAUTY. Snow-drop of dogs, with ear of brownest dye, Like the last orphan leaf of naked tree Which shudders in bleak autumn; though by thee, Of hearing careless and untutored eyes, Not understood articulate speech of men, Nor marked the artificial mind of books, —The mortal's voice eternized by the pen,— Yet hast thou thought and language all unknown To Babel's scholars; oft intensest looks, Long scrutiny o'er some dark-veined stone Dost thou bestow, learning dead mysteries Of the world's birth-day, oft in eager tone With quick-tailed fellows bandiest prompt replies, Solicitudes canine, four-footed amities. LETTER TO B. W. PROCTER, ESQ. FROM OXFORD; MAY, 1825. In every tower, that Oxford has, is swung, Quick, loud, or solemn, the monotonous tongue Which speaks Time's language, the universal one After the countenance of moon or sun,— Translating their still motions to the earth. I cannot read; the reeling belfry's mirth Troubles my senses; therefore, Greek, shut up Your dazzling pages; covered be the cup Which Homer has beneath his mantle old, Steamy with boiling life: your petals fold You fat, square blossoms of the yet young tree Of Britain-grafted, flourishing Germany: Hush! Latin, to your grave:—and, with the chime, My pen shall turn the minutes into rhyme, And, like the dial, blacken them. There sits, Or stands, or lounges, or perhaps on bits Of this rag's daughter, paper, exorcises, With strange black marks and inky wild devices, The witch of worlds, the echo of great verse, About the chasms of the universe, Ringing and bounding immortality.— Give him thy bosom, dark Melpomene, And let him of thy goblet and thine eye Exhaust the swimming, deep insanity. He hath the soul, O let it then be fed, Sea after sea, with that which is not read, Nor wrung by reasoning from a resolute head, But comes like lightning on a hill-top steeple; Heaven's spillings on the lofty laurelled people. Verse to thee, light to thee, wings upraise thee long In the unvacillating soar of song, Thou star-seed of a man! But do not dare To tempt thy Apollonian god too far, Clogging and smoking thy young snake, Renown, In the strait, stony shadows of the town, Lest he grow weak, and pine, and never be What he was born, twin to Eternity. So come, shake London from thy skirts away: So come, forget not it is England's May. For Oxford, ho! by moonlight or by sun: Our horses are not hours, but rather run Foot by foot faster than the second-sand, While the old sunteam, like a plough, doth stand Stuck in thick heaven. Here thou at morn shalt see Spring's dryad-wakening whisper call the tree, And move it to green answers; and beneath, Each side the river which the fishes breathe, Daisies and grass, whose tops were never stirred, Or dews made tremulous, but by foot of bird. And you shall mark in spring's heaven-tapestried room Yesterday's knoppe, burst by its wild perfume, Like woman's childhood, to this morning's bloom; And here a primrose pale beneath a tree, And here a cowslip longing for its bee, And violets and lilies every one Grazing in the great pasture of the sun, Beam after beam, visibly as the grass Is swallowed by the lazy cows that pass. Come look, come walk,—and there shall suddenly Seize you a rapture and a phantasy; High over mountain sweeping, fast and high Through all the intricacies of the sky, As fast and far a ship-wrecked hoard of gold Dives ocean, cutting every billow's fold. These are the honey-minutes of the year Which make man god, and make a god—Shakespeare. Come, gather them with me. . If not, then go, And with thee all the ghosts of Jonson's toe, The fighting Tartars and the Carthaginians: And may your lady-muse's stiff-winged pinions Be naked and impossible to fly, Like a fat goose pen-plucked for poetry. A curse upon thy cream to make it sour: A curse upon thy tea-pot every hour; Spirits of ice possess it! and thy tea, Changed at its contact, hay and straw leaves be! A cold and nipping ague on thine urn! And an invisible canker eat and burn The mathematic picture, near your fire, Of the grave, compass-handed, quiet sire! No more.—Be these the visions of your sorrow When you have read this doggrel through to-morrow, And then refuse to let our Oxford borrow You of the smoky-faced, Augustan town, And unpersuaded drop the paper down. ANOTHER LETTER TO THE SAME. FROM GÖTTINGEN; MARCH, 1826. To-day a truant from the odd, old bones And rinds of flesh, which, as tamed rocks and stones Piled cavernously make his body's dwelling, Have housed man's soul: there, where time's billows swelling Roll a deep, ghostly, and invisible sea Of melted worlds antediluvially, Upon the sand of ever-crumbling hours, God-founded, stands the castle, all its towers With veiny tendrils ivied:—this bright day I leave its chambers, and with oars away Seek some enchanted island, where to play. And what do you that in the enchantment dwell, And should be raving ever? a wild swell Of passionate life rolling about the world, Now sun-sucked to the clouds, dashed on the curled Leaf-hidden daisies, an incarnate storm Letting the sun through on the meadows yellow, Or anything except that earthy fellow, That wise dog's brother, man. O shame to tell! Make tea in Circe's cup, boil the cool well, The well Pierian, which no bird dare sip But nightingales. There let kettles dip Who write their simpering sonnets to its song, And walk on sundays in Parnassus' park:— Take thy example from the sunny lark, Throw off the mantle which conceals the soul, The many-citied world, and seek thy goal Straight as a star-beam falls. Creep not nor climb, As they who place their topmost of sublime On some peak of this planet, pitifully. Dart eagle-wise with open wings, and fly Until you meet the gods. Thus counsel I The men who can, but tremble to be, great: Cursed be the fool who taught to hesitate, And to regret: time lost most bitterly! And thus I write, and I dare write, to thee, Not worshipping, as those are wont to do, Who feed and fear some asinine review. Let Jaggernaut roll on; but we, whose sires Blooded his wheels and prayed around his fires, Laugh at the leaden ass in the god's skin. Example follows precept. I have been Giving some negro minutes of the night, Freed from the slavery of my ruling spright Anatomy the grim, to a new story, In whose satiric pathos we will glory. In it despair has married wildest mirth, And, to their wedding-banquet, all the earth Is bade to bring its enmities and loves, Triumphs and horrors: you shall see the doves Billing with quiet joy, and all the while Their nest's the scull of some old king of Nile. But he who fills the cups, and makes the jest, Pipes to the dancers, is the fool o'th' feast,— Who's he? I've dug him up and decked him trim, And made a mock, a fool, a slave of him, Who was the planet's tyrant, dotard death; Man's hate and dread. Not, with a stoical breath, To meet him, like Augustus, standing up; Nor with grave saws to season the cold cup, Like the philosopher; nor yet to hail His coming with a verse or jesting tale, As Adrian did and More:—but of his night, His moony ghostliness, and silent might To rob him, to uncypress him in the light, To unmask all his secrets; make him play Momus o'er wine by torch-light,—is the way To conquer him, and kill; and from the day, Spurn'd, hiss'd, and hooted, send him back again, An unmask'd braggart to his bankrupt den. For death is more “a jest” than life.—You see Contempt grows quick from familiarity. I owe this wisdom to Anatomy.— Your muse is younger in her soul than mine: O feed her still on woman's smiles and wine, And give the world a tender song once more; For all the good can love and can adore What's human, fair, and gentle. Few, I know, Can bear to sit at my board, when I show The wretchedness and folly of man's all, And laugh myself right heartily. Your call Is higher and more human: I will do Unsociably my part, and still be true To my own soul; but e'er admire you, And own that you have nature's kindest trust, Her weak and dear to nourish,—that I must. Then fare, as you deserve it, well, and live In the calm feelings you to others give. THE BODING DREAMS. I In lover's ear a wild voice cried: “Sleeper, awake and rise!” A pale form stood at his bed-side, With heavy tears in her sad eyes. “A beckoning hand, a moaning sound, A new-dug grave in weedy ground For her who sleeps in dreams of thee. Awake! Let not the murder be!” Unheard the faithful dream did pray, And sadly sighed itself away. “Sleep on,” sung Sleep, “to-morrow “'Tis time to know thy sorrow.” “Sleep on,” sung Death, “to-morrow “From me thy sleep thou'lt borrow.” Sleep on, lover, sleep on, The tedious dream is gone; The bell tolls one. II Another hour, another dream: “Awake! awake!” it wailed, “Arise, ere with the moon's last beam “Her dearest life hath paled.” A hidden light, a muffled tread, A daggered hand beside the bed Of her who sleeps in dreams of thee. Thou wak'st not: let the murder be. In vain the faithful dream did pray, And sadly sighed itself away. “Sleep on,” sung Sleep, “to-morrow “'Tis time to know thy sorrow.” “Sleep on,” sung Death, “to-morrow “From me thy sleep thou'lt borrow.” Sleep on, lover, sleep on, The tedious dream is gone; Soon comes the sun. III Another hour, another dream: A red wound on a snowy breast, A rude hand stifling the last scream, On rosy lips a death-kiss pressed. Blood on the sheets, blood on the floor, The murderer stealing through the door. “Now,” said the voice, with comfort deep, “She sleeps indeed, and thou may'st sleep.” The scornful dream then turned away To the first, weeping cloud of day. “Sleep on,” sung Sleep, “to-morrow “'Tis time to know thy sorrow. “Sleep on, sung Death, to-morrow “From me thy sleep thou'lt borrow.” Sleep on, lover, sleep on, The tedious dream is gone; The murder's done. LOVE'S LAST MESSAGES. Merry, merry little stream, Tell me, hast thou seen my dear? I left him with an azure dream, Calmly sleeping on his bier— But he has fled! “I passed him in his church-yard bed— “A yew is sighing o'er his head, “And grass-roots mingle with his hair.” What doth he there? O cruel! can he lie alone? Or in the arms of one more dear? Or hides he in that bower of stone, To cause and kiss away my fear? “He doth not speak, he doth not moan— “Blind, motionless he lies alone; “But, ere the grave snake fleshed his sting. “This one warm tear he bade me bring “And lay it at thy feet “Among the daisies sweet.” Moonlight whisperer, summer air, Songster of the groves above, Tell the maiden rose I wear, Whether thou hast seen my love. “This night in heaven I saw him lie, “Discontented with his bliss; “And on my lips he left this kiss, “For thee to taste and then to die.” THE GHOSTS' MOONSHINE. I It is midnight, my wedded; Let us lie under The tempest bright undreaded, In the warm thunder: (Tremble and weep not! What can you fear?) My heart's best wish is thine,— That thou wert white, and bedded On the softest bier, In the ghosts' moonshine. Is that the wind? No, no; Only two devils, that blow Through the murderer's ribs to and fro, In the ghosts' moonshine. II Who is there, she said afraid, yet Stirring and awaking The poor old dead? His spade, it Is only making,— (Tremble and weep not! What do you crave?) Where yonder grasses twine, A pleasant bed, my maid, that Children call a grave, In the cold moonshine. Is that the wind? No, no; Only two devils, that blow Through the murderer's ribs to and fro, In the ghosts' moonshine. III What dost thou strain above her Lovely throat's whiteness? A silken chain, to cover Her bosom's brightness? (Tremble and weep not: what do you fear?) —My blood is spilt like wine, Thou hast strangled and slain me, lover, Thou hast stabbed me, dear, In the ghosts' moonshine. Is that the wind? No, no; Only her goblin doth blow Through the murderer's ribs to and fro, In its own moonshine. FROM THE GERMAN. I. “Come with me, thou gentle maid, “The stars are strong, and make a shade “Of yew across your mother's tomb; “Leave your chamber's vine-leaved gloom, “Leave your harp-strings, loved one, “'Tis our hour;” the robber said; “Yonder comes the goblins' sun, “For, when men are still in bed, “Day begins with the old dead. “Leave your flowers so dewed with weeping, “And our feverish baby sleeping; “Come to me, thou gentle maid, “'Tis our hour.” The robber said. II. To the wood, whose shade is night, Went they in the owls' moonlight. As they passed, the common wild Like a murderous jester smiled, Dimpled twice with nettly graves. You may mark her garment white, In the night-wind how it waves: The night-wind to the churchyard flew, And whispered underneath the yew; “Mother churchyard, in my breath, “I've a lady's sigh of death.” —“Sleep thou there, thou robber's wife.” Said he, clasping his wet knife. THE PHANTOM-WOOER. I A ghost, that loved a lady fair, Ever in the starry air Of midnight at her pillow stood; And, with a sweetness skies above The luring words of human love, Her soul the phantom wooed. Sweet and sweet is their poisoned note, The little snakes' of silver throat, In mossy skulls that nest and lie, Ever singing “die, oh! die.” II Young soul, put off your flesh, and come With me into the quiet tomb, Our bed is lovely, dark, and sweet; The earth will swing us, as she goes, Beneath our coverlid of snows, And the warm leaden sheet. Dear and dear is their poisoned note, The little snakes' of silver throat, In mossy skulls that nest and lie, Ever singing “die, oh! die.” A DIRGE. (WRITTEN FOR A DRAMA.) To-day is a thought, a fear is to-morrow, And yesterday is our sin and our sorrow; And life is a death, Where the body's the tomb, And the pale sweet breath Is buried alive in its hideous gloom. Then waste no tear, For we are the dead; the living are here, In the stealing earth, and the heavy bier. Death lives but an instant, and is but a sigh, And his son is unnamed immortality, Whose being is thine. Dear ghost, so to die Is to live,—and life is a worthless lie.— Then we weep for ourselves, and wish thee good bye. ANOTHER DIRGE. (FOR A YOUNG MAIDEN.) Hushed be sighing, near the string, O'er whose tremors deep we sing The youngest Death, who hath no fears, Blood, nor pang, nor any tears. Hushed be sighing! Fair and young as Venus' child, Only paler, and most mild; End of all that's dear and young, Thee we mean, soft Drop of roses; Hush of birds that sweetest sung, That beginn'st when music closes; The maiden's Dying! BRIDAL SERENADE. Maiden, thou sittest alone above, Crowned with flowers, and like a sprite Starrily clothed in a garment white: Thou art the only maiden I love, And a soul of fondness to thee I bring, Thy glorious beauty homaging,— But ah! thou wearest a golden ring. Maiden, thou'st broken no vow to me, But undone me alone with gentleness, Wasting upon me glances that bless; And knew'st that I never was born for thee. No hope, no joy; yet never more My heart shall murmur; now 'tis o'er, I'll bless thee dying at thy door. DIRGE. To her couch of evening rest 'Neath the sun's divinest west, Bear we, in the silent car, This consumed incense star, This dear maid whose life is shed, And whose sweets are sweetly dead. DIRGE AND HYMENEAL: SUPPOSED TO BE SUNG AS THE FUNERAL AND WEDDING PROCESSIONS CROSS EACH OTHER AT THE CHURCH-DOOR. Dirge. Woe! woe! this is death's hour Of spring; behold his flower! Fair babe of life, to whom Death, and the dreamy tomb, Was nothing yesterday, And now is all! The maiden, from her play Beside her lover gay, The church-yard voices call, Tolling so slow, Woe! woe! Hymeneal. Joy! joy! it is love's day; Strew the young conqueror's way With summer's glories young, O'er which the birds have sung, Bright weeds from fairy rings; Here, there, away! Joy, joy the tree-bird sings, Joy, joy, a hundred springs' Melodies ever say,— Maiden and boy, Joy! joy! Dirge. She cut the roses down, And wreathed her bridal crown. Death, playful, called her ‘blossom,’ And tore her from life's bosom. Fair maiden, or fair ghost,— Which is thy name?— Come to the spectral host; They pity thee the most, And, to the cold world's shame, Soft cry they, low, Woe! woe! DIAL-THOUGHTS. I I think of thee at day-break still, And then thou art my playmate small, Beside our straw-roofed village rill Gathering cowslips tall, And chasing oft the butterfly, Which flutters past like treacherous life. You smile at me and at you I, A husband boy and baby wife. II I think of thee at noon again, And thy meridian beauty high Falls on my bosom, like young rain Out of a summer sky: And I reflect it in the tear, Which 'neath thy picture drops forlorn, And then my love is bright and clear, And manlier than it was at morn. III I think of thee by evening's star, And softly melancholy, slow, An eye doth glisten from afar, All full of lovely woe. The air then sighingly doth part, And, or from Death the cold, or Love, I hear the passing of a dart, But hope once more, and look above. IV I think of thee at black midnight, And woe and agony it is To see thy cheek so deadly white, To hear thy grave-worm hiss. But looking on thy lips is cheer, They closed in love, pronouncing love; And then I tremble, not for fear, But in thy breath from heaven above. DREAM-PEDLARY. I If there were dreams to sell, What would you buy? Some cost a passing bell; Some a light sigh, That shakes from Life's fresh crown Only a rose-leaf down. If there were dreams to sell, Merry and sad to tell, And the crier rung the bell, What would you buy? II A cottage lone and still, With bowers nigh, Shadowy, my woes to still, Until I die. Such pearl from Life's fresh crown Fain would I shake me down. Were dreams to have at will, This would best heal my ill, This would I buy. III But there were dreams to sell Ill didst thou buy; Life is a dream, they tell, Waking, to die. Dreaming a dream to prize, Is wishing ghosts to rise; And, if I had the spell To call the buried well, Which one would I? IV If there are ghosts to raise, What shall I call, Out of hell's murky haze, Heaven's blue pall? Raise my loved long-lost boy To lead me to his joy.— There are no ghosts to raise; Out of death lead no ways; Vain is the call. V Know'st thou not ghosts to sue? No love thou hast. Else lie, as I will do, And breathe thy last. So out of Life's fresh crown Fall like a rose leaf down. Thus are the ghosts to wooe; Thus are all dreams made true, Ever to last! BALLAD OF HUMAN LIFE. I When we were girl and boy together, We tossed about the flowers And wreathed the blushing hours Into a posy green and sweet. I sought the youngest, best, And never was at rest Till I had laid them at thy fairy feet. But the days of childhood they were fleet, And the blooming sweet-briar breathed weather, When we were boy and girl together. II Then we were lad and lass together, And sought the kiss of night Before we felt aright, Sitting and singing soft and sweet. The dearest thought of heart With thee 'twas joy to part, And the greater half was thine, as meet. Still my eyelid's dewy, my veins they beat At the starry summer-evening weather, When we were lad and lass together. III And we are man and wife together, Although thy breast, once bold With song, be closed and cold Beneath flowers' roots and birds' light feet. Yet sit I by thy tomb, And dissipate the gloom With songs of loving faith and sorrow sweet. And fate and darkling grave kind dreams do cheat, That, while fair life, young hope, despair and death are, We're boy and girl, and lass and lad, and man and wife together. SONG, ON THE WATER. I Wild with passion, sorrow-beladen, Bend the thought of thy stormy soul On its home, on its heaven, the loved maiden; And peace shall come at her eyes' control. Even so night's starry rest possesses With its gentle spirit these tamed waters, And bids the wave, with weedy tresses Embower the ocean's pavement stilly Where the sea-girls lie, the mermaid-daughters, Whose eyes, not born to weep, More palely-lidded sleep, Than in our fields the lily; And sighing in their rest More sweet than is its breath; And quiet as its death Upon a lady's breast. II Heart high-beating, triumph-bewreathed, Search the record of loves gone by, And borrow the blessings by them bequeathed To deal from out of thy victory's sky. Even so, throughout the midnight deep, The silent moon doth seek the bosoms Of those dear mermaid-girls asleep, To feed its dying rays anew, Like to the bee on earthly blossoms, Upon their silvery whiteness, And on the rainbow brightness Of their eyelashes' dew, And kisseth their limbs o'er: Her lips where they do quaff Strike starry tremors off, As from the waves our oar. LOVE-IN-IDLENESS. I “Shall I be your first love, lady, shall I be your first? Oh! then I'll fall before you, down on my velvet knee, And deeply bend my rosy head and press it upon thee, And swear that there is nothing more, for which my heart doth thirst, But a downy kiss, and pink, Between your lips' soft chink.” II “Yes, you shall be my first love, boy, and you shall be my first, And I will raise you up again unto my bosom's fold; And, when you kisses many one on lip and cheek have told, I'll let you loose upon the grass, to leave me if you durst; And so we'll toy away The night besides the day.” III “But let me be your second love, but let me be your second, For then I'll tap so gently, dear, upon your window pane, And creep between the curtains in, where never man has lain, And never leave thy gentle side till the morning star hath beckoned, Held in the silken lace Of thy young arms' embrace.” IV “Well thou shalt be my second love, yes, gentle boy, my second, And I will wait at eve for thee all lonely in my bower, And yield unto thy kisses, like a bud to April's shower, From moonset till the tower-clock the hour of dawn hath reckoned, And lock thee with my arms All silent up in charms.” V “No, I will be thy third love, lady, ay I will be the third, And break upon thee, bathing, in woody place alone, And catch thee to my saddle and ride o'er stream and stone, And press thee well, and kiss thee well, and never speak a word, 'Till thou hast yielded up The first taste of love's cup.” VI “Then thou shalt not be my first love, boy, nor my second, nor my third; If thou'rt the first, I'll laugh at thee and pierce thy flesh with thorns; If the second, from my chamber pelt with jeering laugh and scorns; And if thou darest be the third, I'll draw my dirk unheard And cut thy heart in two,— And then die, weeping you.” THE REASON WHY. I I love thee and I love thee not, I love thee, yet I'd rather not, All of thee, yet I know not what. A flowery eye as tender, A swan-like neck as slender, And on it a brown little spot For tears to fall afraid on, And kisses to be paid on, Have other maidens too. Then why love I, love, none but you? If I could find the reason why, Methinks my love would quickly die. II Ay, knew I how to hate thee, maid, I'd hate thee for I knew not what, Excepting that I'd rather not Be thy friend or foeman; For thou'rt the only woman, On whom to think my heart's afraid; For, if I would abhor thee, The more must I long for thee. What others force me to, I turn me from; why not from you? If I could find the reason why, Methinks my love would quickly die. III Yet should'st thou cease my heart to move To longings, that I'd rather not, And tried I hate, I know not what My heart would do for mourning; Love I,—it bursts, love scorning. O loveliest hate, most hateful love, This combat and endeavour Is what enslaves me ever. I'll neither of the two, Or hate or love the love of you. And now I've found the reason why, I know my love can never die. THE TWO ARCHERS. I At break of bright May-morning, When, triumphing o'er dark, The sun's inspired lark, All sprites and spectres scorning, And laughing at all creatures' joys Who could not hang, and dive, and poise In their own web and flood of noise, Dropped, out of his heart's treasure, The sunbeam's path along, Sparks and dews of song, As if there were no pleasure But to rise and sing and fly, Winged and all soul, into the sky: II At break of this May-morning, A maiden young and coy Saw a wild archer boy Flying around and scorning, Birdlike, a withered bowman's arts, Who aimed, as he, at roses' hearts. Each cried “come buy my darts, They are with magic laden To deify the blood; An angel in the bud, Half-closed, is a maiden, Till, opened by such wound, she fly, Winged and all soul into the sky.” III “You archers of May-morning,” Said she, “if I must choose, Such joy is to peruse, In the star-light adorning, The urchin's eye, that my desire Is for his darts, whose breath fans higher The smitten roses like a fire.” So Love,—'twas he,—shot smiling His shaft, then flew away; Alas! that morn of May! Love fled, there's no beguiling Repentance, but by hopes to fly, Winged and all soul, into the sky. IV So one December morning, When the bold lark no more Rebuked the ghosts so sore, When dews were not adorning Ought but that maiden's cheek, where wide The blushes spread their leaves, to hide The broken heart which such supplied;— She sought the pair of May-day, And to the old one saith, “Let thy dart, stedfast Death, Cure a forsaken lady; Its point is but for those who'd fly, Winged and all soul, into the sky.” THE RUNAWAY. I Has no one seen my heart of you? My heart has run away; And, if you catch him, ladies, do Return him me, I pray. On earth he is no more, I hear, Upon the land or sea; For the women found the rogue so queer, They sent him back to me. In heaven there is no purchaser For such strange ends and odds, Says a jew, who goes to Jupiter To buy and sell old gods. So there's but one place more to search, That's not genteel to tell, Where demonesses go to church:— So christians fair, farewell. SONG ON THE WATER. I As mad sexton's bell, tolling For earth's loveliest daughter, Night's dumbness breaks rolling Ghostily: So our boat breaks the water Witchingly. II As her look the dream troubles Of her tearful-eyed lover, So our sails in the bubbles Ghostily Are mirrored, and hover Moonily. ALPINE SPIRIT'S SONG. I O'er the snow, through the air, to the mountain, With the antelope, with the eagle, ho! With a bound, with a feathery row, To the side of the icy fountain, Where the gentians blue-belled blow. Where the storm-sprite, the rain-drops counting, Cowers under the bright rainbow, Like a burst of midnight fire, Singing shoots my fleet desire, Winged with the wing of love, Earth below and stars above. II Let me rest on the snow, never pressed But by chamois light and by eagle fleet, Where the hearts of the antelope beat 'Neath the light of the moony cresset, Where the wild cloud rests his feet, And the scented airs caress it From the alpine orchis sweet: And about the Sandalp lone Voices airy breathe a tone, Charming, with the sense of love, Earth below and stars above. III Through the night, like a dragon from Pilate Out of murky cave, let us cloudy sail Over lake, over bowery vale, As a chime of bells, at twilight In the downy evening gale, Passes swimming tremulously light; Till we reach yon rocky pale Of the mountain crowning all, Slumber there by waterfall, Lonely like a spectre's love, Earth beneath, and stars above. SONG: TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN OF WALTHER VON DER VOGELWEIDE. I. Under the lime-tree, on the daisied ground, Two that I know of made their bed; There you may see, heaped and scattered round, Grass and blossoms, broken and shed, All in a thicket down in the dale; Tandaradei— Sweetly sang the nightingale. II. Ere I set foot in the meadow, already Some one was waiting for somebody; There was a meeting—O gracious Lady! There is no pleasure again for me. Thousands of kisses there he took,— Tandaradei— See my lips, how red they look! III. Leaf and blossom he had pulled and piled For a couch, a green one, soft and high; And many a one hath gazed and smiled, Passing the bower and pressed grass by; And the roses crushed hath seen,— Tandaradei— Where I laid my head between. IV. In this love passage, if any one had been there, How sad and shamed should I be! But what were we a doing alone among the green there, No soul shall ever know except my love and me, And the little nightingale.— Tandaradei— She, I think, will tell no tale. SONG OF THE STYGIAN NAIADES. I Proserpine may pull her flowers, Wet with dew or wet with tears, Red with anger, pale with fears, Is it any fault of ours, If Pluto be an amorous king, And comes home nightly, laden, Underneath his broad bat-wing, With a gentle, mortal maiden? Is it so, Wind, is it so? All that you and I do know Is, that we saw fly and fix 'Mongst the reeds and flowers of Styx, Yesterday, Where the Furies made their hay For a bed of tiger cubs, A great fly of Beelzebub's, The bee of hearts, which mortals name Cupid, Love, and Fie for shame. II Proserpine may weep in rage, But, ere I and you have done Kissing, bathing in the sun, What I have in yonder cage, Bird or serpent, wild or tame, She shall guess and ask in vain; But, if Pluto does't again, It shall sing out loud his shame. What hast caught then? What hast caught? Nothing but a poet's thought, Which so light did fall and fix 'Mongst the reeds and flowers of Styx, Yesterday, Where the Furies made their hay For a bed of tiger cubs,— A great fly of Beelzebub's, The bee of hearts, which mortals name Cupid, Love, and Fie for shame. THE LILY OF THE VALLEY. Where the hare-bells are ringing Their peal of sunny flowers, And a bird of merry soul Sings away the birthday hours Of the valley-lily low, Opening, dewily and slow, Petals, dear to young and fair For the prophecy they bear Of the coming roses— The free bold bird of merry soul Amidst his leaves cannot control His triumphant love of spring. Thou bird of joyous soul, Why can'st thou not control Thy triumphant love of spring? I know that thou dost rally Thy spirit proud to sing, Because to-day is born The lily of the valley. Oh! rather should'st thou mourn; For that flower so meek and low, Born with its own death-bell, Only cometh to foretell Unpitying winter's doom, Who in scorn doth lay it low In the tomb. Vain is all its prayer, It may flatter, as it will, The ungentle hours With its ring of toying flowers; Unrelenting they must kill With their scornful breath, For the very petals fair, Which the destined flower uncloses In its innocence, To plead for its defence, By the prophecy they bear Of the coming roses, Sign the warrant for its death. A LAMENT. In the twilight, silent smiled All alone the daisy's eyelid, Fringed with pink-tipped petals piled. —In the morning 'twas no more; In its place a gout of gore. Break of day was break of heart, Since, dear maiden, dead thou art. DIRGE. Let dew the flowers fill; No need of fell despair, Though to the grave you bear One still of soul—but now too still, One fair—but now too fair. For, beneath your feet, the mound, And the waves, that play around, Have meaning in their grassy, and their watery, smiles; And, with a thousand sunny wiles, Each says, as he reproves, Death's arrow oft is Love's. EPITAPH. The form's divinity, the heart's best grace, Where are they? Have they their immortal throne Upon thy maiden's thought, and peerless face, Thou cold-eyed reader? Yet, beneath this stone Dust lies, weeds grow: and this is the remain Of one best union of that deathless twain. POETIC FRAGMENTS. THE TREE OF LIFE. There is a mighty, magic tree, That holds the round earth and the sea In its branches like a net: Its immortal trunk is set Broader than the tide of night With its star-tipped billows bright: Human thought doth on it grow, Like the barren misletoe On an old oak's forehead-skin. Ever while the planets spin Their blue existence, that great plant Shall nor bud nor blossom want; Summer, winter, night and day, It must still its harvest pay; Ever while the night grows up Along the wall of the wide sky, And the thunder-bee sweeps by, On its brown, wet wing, to dry Every day-star's crystal cup Of its yellow summer:—still At the foot of heaven's hill, With fruit and blossom flush and rife, Stays that tree of Human Life. Let us mark yon newest bloom Heaving through the leafy gloom; Now a pinkish bud it grows Scentless, bloomless; slow unclose Its outer pages to the sun, Opened, but not yet begun. Its first leaf is infancy, Pencilled pale and tenderly, Smooth its cheek and mild its eye: Now it swells, and curls its head,— Little infancy is shed. Broader childhood is the next— THE NEW-BORN STAR. The world is born to-day! What is the world?—Behold the wonder: With a mighty thunder, 'Round the sun, it rolls this way; And its shadow falls afar Over many a star, And the interstellar vale, Through which some aged, patient globe, (Whose gaunt sides no summers robe,) Like a prisoner through his grate, Shivering in despair doth wait For sunbeams broken, old, and pale. Bounding, like its own fleet deer Down a hill, behold the sphere! Now a mountain, tall and wide, Hanging weighty on its side Pulls it down impetuously; Yet the little butterfly, Whom the daisy's dew doth glut, With his wings' small pages shut, Was not stirred. Now forests fall, like clouds that gather O'er the plain's unruffled weather: Burst great rocks, with thunder, out: Lakes, their plunged feet about, Round, and smooth, and heaving ever, An unawakened serpent-river Coiled and sleeping. Silver changes now are creeping 'Round the descending summit of the ball: Pastures break, and stedfast land Sinks, melting:—mighty ocean is at hand.— Space for eternal waves! Be strong and wide, Thou new-born star! Reflecting all the sky, And its lone sun, the island-starred tide Swells billowing by. At last the dreadful sea is curled Behind the nations. Mark ye now The death-intending wrinkles of his brow? He is the murderous Judas of the world; What valley green with stream and tree, The fairest, sweetest place, THRENODY. No sunny ray, no silver night, Here cruelly alight! Glare of noon-tide, star of e'en, Otherwhere descend! No violet-eyed green, With its daisies' yellow end, The dewy debt receive of any eye! It is a grave: and she doth lie 'Neath roses' root, And the fawn's mossy foot, Under the sky-lark's grassy floor, Whose graceful life held every day,— As lilies, dew—as dews, the starry ray— More music, grace, delight than they. When stars are few let light be here, Of the softest, through the boughs Berry-laden, sad and few; And the wings of one small bird, His form unseen, his voice unheard— LINES, WRITTEN AT GENEVA; JULY, 1824. The hour is starry, and the airs that stray, Sad wanderers from their golden home of day, On night's black mountain, melt and fade away In sorrow that is music. Some there be Make them blue pillows on Geneva's sea, And sleep upon their best-loved planet's shade: And every herb is sleeping in the glade;— They have drunk sunshine and the linnet's song, Till every leaf's soft sleep is dark and strong. Or was there ever sound, or can what was Now be so dead? Although no flowers or grass Grow from the corpse of a deceased sound, Somewhat, methinks, should mark the air around Its dying place and tomb, A gentle music, or a pale perfume: For hath it not a body and a spirit, A noise and meaning? and, when one doth hear it Twice born, twice dying, doubly found and lost, That second self, that echo, is its ghost. But even the dead are all asleep this time, And not a grave shakes with the dreams of crime:— The earth is full of chambers for the dead, And every soul is quiet in his bed; Some who have seen their bodies moulder away, Antediluvian minds,—most happy they, Who have no body but the beauteous air, No body but their minds. Some wretches are Now lying with the last and only bone Of their old selves, and that one worm alone That ate their heart: some, buried just, behold The weary flesh, like an used mansion, sold Unto a stranger, and see enter it The earthquake winds and waters of the pit, Or children's spirits in its holes to play. STANZAS. (FROM THE IVORY GATE.) The mighty thought of an old world Fans, like a dragon's wing unfurled, The surface of my yearnings deep; And solemn shadows then awake, Like the fish-lizard in the lake, Troubling a planet's morning sleep. My waking is a Titan's dream, Where a strange sun, long set, doth beam Through Montezuma's cypress bough: Through the fern wilderness forlorn Glisten the giant harts' great horn, And serpents vast with helmed brow. The measureless from caverns rise With steps of earthquake, thunderous cries, And graze upon the lofty wood; The palmy grove, through which doth gleam Such antediluvian ocean's stream, Haunts shadowy my domestic mood. LINES WRITTEN IN SWITZERLAND. What silence drear in England's oaky forest, Erst merry with the redbreast's ballad song Or rustic roundelay! No hoof-print on the sward, Where sometime danced Spenser's equestrian verse Its mazy measure! Now by pathless brook Gazeth alone the broken-hearted stag, And sees no tear fall in from pitiful eye Like kindest Shakespeare's. We, who marked how fell Young Adonais, sick of vain endeavour Larklike to live on high in tower of song; And looked still deeper thro' each other's eyes At every flash of Shelley's dazzling spirit, Quivering like dagger on the breast of night,— That seemed some hidden natural light reflected Upon time's scythe, a moment and away; We, who have seen Mount Rydal's snowy head Bound round with courtly jingles; list so long Like old Orion for the break of morn, Like Homer blind for sound of youthful harp; And, if a wandering music swells the gale, 'Tis some poor, solitary heartstring burst. Well, Britain; let the fiery Frenchman boast That at the bidding of the charmer moves Their nation's heart, as ocean 'neath the moon Silvered and soothed. Be proud of Manchester, Pestiferous Liverpool, Ocean-Avernus, Where bullying blasphemy, like a slimy lie, Creeps to the highest church's pinnacle, And glistening infects the light of heaven. O flattering likeness on a copper coin! Sit still upon your slave-raised cotton ball, With upright toasting fork and toothless cat: The country clown still holds her for a lion. The voice, the voice! when the affrighted herds Dash heedless to the edge of craggy abysses, And the amazed circle of scared eagles Spire to the clouds, amid the gletscher clash When avalanches fall, nation-alarums,— But clearer, though not loud, a voice is heard Of proclamation or of warning stern. Yet, if I tread out of the Alpine shade, And once more weave the web of thoughtful verse, May no vainglorious motive break my silence, Since I have sate unheard so long, in hope That mightier and better might assay The potent spell to break, which has fair Truth Banished so drear a while from mouths of song. Though genius, bearing out of other worlds New freights of thought from fresh-discovered mines, Be but reciprocated love of Truth: Witness kind Shakespeare, our recording angel, Newton, whose thought rebuilt the universe, And Galileo, broken-hearted seer, Who, like a moon attracted naturally, Kept circling round the central sun of Truth. Not in the popular playhouse, or full throng Of opera-gazers longing for deceit; Not on the velvet day-bed, novel-strewn, Or in the interval of pot and pipe; Not between sermon and the scandalous paper, May verse like this ere hope an eye to feed on't. But if there be, who, having laid the loved Where they may drop a tear in roses' cups, With half their hearts inhabit other worlds; If there be any—ah! were there but few— Who watching the slow lighting up of stars, Lonely at eve, like seamen sailing near Some island-city where their dearest dwell, Cannot but guess in sweet imagining,— Alas! too sweet, doubtful, and melancholy,— Which light is glittering from their loved one's home: Such may perchance, with favourable mind, Follow my thought along its mountainous path. Now then to Caucasus, the cavernous.— DOOMSDAY. If I can raise one ghost, why I will raise And call up doomsday from behind the east. Awake then, ghostly doomsday! Throw up your monuments, ye buried men That lie in ruined cities of the wastes! Ye battle fields, and woody mountain sides, Ye lakes and oceans, and ye lava floods That have o'erwhelmed great cities, now roll back! And let the sceptred break their pyramids, An earthquake of the buried shake the domes Of arched cathedrals, and o'erturn the forests, Until the grassy mounds and sculptured floors, The monumental statues, hollow rocks, The paved churchyard, and the flowery mead, And ocean's billowy sarcophagi, Pass from the bosoms of the rising people Like clouds! Enough of stars and suns immortal Have risen in heaven: to-day, in earth and sea Riseth mankind. And first, yawn deep and wide, Ye marble palace-floors, And let the uncoffined bones, which ye conceal, Ascend, and dig their purple murderers up, Out of their crowned death. Ye catacombs Open your gates, and overwhelm the sands With an eruption of the naked millions, Out of old centuries! The buried navies Shall hear the call, and shoot up from the sea, Whose wrecks shall knock against the hollow mountains, And wake the swallowed cities in their hearts. Forgotten armies rattle with their spears Against the rocky walls of their sepulchres: An earthquake of the buried shakes the pillars Of the thick-sown cathedrals; guilty forests, Where bloody spades have dug 'mid nightly storms; The muddy drowning-places of the babes; The pyramids, and bony hiding places, “Thou rainbow on the tearful lash of doomsday's morning star Rise quick, and let me gaze into that planet deep and far, As into a loved eye; Or I must, like the fiery child of the Vesuvian womb, Burst with my flickering ghost abroad, before the sun of doom Rolls up the spectre sky.” A lowly mound, at stormy night, sent up this ardent prayer Out of a murderer's grave, a traitor's nettly bed, And the deeds of him, more dread than Cain, whose wickedness lay there, All mankind hath heard or read. “Oh doomsday, doomsday come! thou creative morn Of graves in earth, and under sea, all teeming at the horn Of angels fair and dread. As thou the ghosts shalt waken, so I, the ghost, wake thee; For thy rising sun and I shall rise together from the sea, The eldest of the dead.” So crying, o'er the billowy main, an old ghost strode To a churchyard on the shore, O'er whose ancient corpse the billowy main of ships had ebbed and flowed, Four thousand years or more. “World, wilt thou yield thy spirits up, and be convulsed and die? And, as I haunt the billowy main, thy ghost shall haunt the sky, A pale unheeded star. Oh doomsday, doomsday, when wilt thou dawn at length for me?” So having prayed in moonlight waves, beneath the shipwrecked sea, In spectral caverns far, On moonlight, o'er the billowy main, the old ghost stepped, And the winds their mockery sung. THRENODY. Far away, As we hear The song of wild swans winging Through the day, The thought of him, who is no more, comes ringing On my ear. Gentle fear On the breast Of my memory comes breaking, Near and near, As night winds' murmurous music waking Seas at rest. As the blest Tearful eye Sees the sun, behind the ocean, Red i'th' west, Grow pale, and in changing hues and fading motion Wane and die: So do I Wake or dream</field>

ACT I. Scene I. Port of Ancona. Enter Mandrake and Joan. Mandr. Am I a man of gingerbread that you should mould me to your liking? To have my way, in spite of your tongue and reason's teeth, tastes better than Hungary wine; and my heart beats in a honey-pot now I reject you and all sober sense: so tell my master, the doctor, he must seek another zany for his booth, a new wise merry Andrew. My jests are cracked, my coxcomb fallen, my bauble confiscated, my cap decapitated. Toll the bell; for oh! for oh! Jack Pudding is no more! Joan. Wilt thou away from me then, sweet Mandrake? Wilt thou not marry me? Mandr. Child, my studies must first be ended. Thou knowest I hunger after wisdom, as the red sea after ghosts: therefore will I travel awhile. Joan. Whither, dainty Homunculus? Mandr. Whither should a student in the black arts, a journeyman magician, a Rosicrucian? Where is our country? You heard the herald this morning thrice invite all christian folk to follow the brave knight, Sir Wolfram, to the shores of Egypt, and there help to free from bondage his noble fellow in arms, Duke Melveric, whom, on a pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre, wild pagans captured. There, Joan, in that Sphynx land found Raimund Lully those splinters of the philosopher's stone with which he made English Edward's gold. There dwell hoary magicians, who have given up their trade and live sociably as crocodiles on the banks of the Nile. There can one chat with mummies in a pyramid, and breakfast on basilisk's eggs. Thither then, Homunculus Mandrake, son of the great Paracelsus; languish no more in the ignorance of these climes, but aboard with alembic and crucible, and weigh anchor for Egypt. Enter Isbrand. Isbr. Good morrow, brother Vanity! How? soul of a pickle-herring, body of a spagirical toss-pot, doublet of motley, and mantle of pilgrim, how art thou transmuted! Wilt thou desert our brotherhood, fool sublimate? Shall the motley chapter no longer boast thee? Wilt thou forswear the order of the bell, and break thy vows to Momus? Have mercy on Wisdom and relent. Mandr. Respect the grave and sober, I pray thee. To-morrow I know thee not. In truth, I mark that our noble faculty is in its last leaf. The dry rot of prudence hath eaten the ship of fools to dust; she is no more sea worthy. The world will see its ears in a glass no longer; So we are laid aside and shall soon be forgotten; for why should the feast of asses come but once a year, when all the days are foaled of one mother? O world, world! The gods and fairies left thee, for thou wert too wise; and now, thou Socratic star, thy demon, the great Pan, Folly, is parting from thee. The oracles still talked in their sleep, shall our grand-children say, till Master Merriman's kingdom was broken up: now is every man his own fool, and the world's sign is taken down. (He sings.) Folly hath now turned out of door Mankind and Fate, who were before Jove's harlequin and clown: For goosegrass-harvest now is o'er; The world's no stage, no tavern more, Its sign, the Fool's ta'en down. Isbr. Farewell, thou great-eared mind: I mark, by thy talk, that thou commencest philosopher, and then thou art only a fellow-servant out of livery. But lo! here come the uninitiated— (Enter Thorwald, Amala, Wolfram, Knights and Ladies.) Thorw. The turning tide; the sea's wide leafless wind, Wherein no birds inhabit and few traffic, Making his cave within your sunny sails; The eager waves, whose golden, silent kisses Seal an alliance with your bubbling oars; And our still-working wishes, that impress Their meaning on the conscience of the world, And prompt the unready Future,—all invite you Unto your voyage. Prosperous be the issue, As is the promise, and the purpose good! Are all the rest aboard? Wolfr. All. 'Tis a band Of knights, whose bosoms pant with one desire, And live but in the hope to free their prince: All hearts beat merrily, all arms are ready. Mandr. All, sir Knight; even the very pigs and capons, and poor dear great Mandrake must be shipped too. Wolfr. Who is this saucy fellow, that prates between? Isbr. One of the many you have made. Yesterday he was a fellow of my colour and served a quacksalver, but now he lusts after the mummy country, whither you are bound. 'Tis a servant of the rosy cross, a correspondent of the stars; the dead are his boon companions, and the secrets of the moon his knowledge. But had I been cook to a chameleon, I could not sweeten the air to his praise enough. Suffice it, of his wisdom Solomon knew less than a bee of fossil flowers, or the ambrosian demigods of table beer. We fools send him as our ambassador to Africa; take him with you, or be yourself our consul. Wolfr. Aboard then in all speed; and sink us not with thy understanding. Mandr. I thank thee, Knight. Twice shalt thou live for this, if I bottle eternity. [Exit, with Joan. Thorw. These letters yet, full of most weighty secrets: Wherein, of what I dare but whisper to thee, Since the dissemblers listen to our speech; Of his two sons, whose love and dread ambition, Crossing like deadly swords, teach us affright; And of the uncertain people, who incline Daily more to the present influence, Forgetting all that their sense apprehends not; I have at large discoursed unto the duke: And may you find his spirit strong to bear The bending load of such untoward tidings, As must press hard upon him. Amala. And forget not Our duke, with gentle greetings, to remind Of those who have no sword to raise for him, But whose unarmed love is not less true, Than theirs who seek him helmed. Farewell, sir knight; They say you serve a lady in those lands, So we dare offer you no token else But our good wishes. Wolfr. Thanks, and farewell to all; And so I take my leave. Amala. We to our homes; You to the homeless waves; unequal parting. Wolfr. The earth may open, and the sea o'erwhelm; Many the ways, the little home is one; Thither the courser leads, thither the helm, And at one gate we meet when all is done. [Exeunt all but Wolfram and Isbrand. Isbr. Stay: you have not my blessing yet. With what jest shall I curse you in earnest? Know you this garb, and him who wears it, and wherefore it is worn? A father slain and plundered; a sister's love first worn in the bosom, then trampled in the dust: our fraternal bond, shall it so end that thou savest him whom we should help to damn? O do it, and I shall learn to laugh the dead out of their coffins! Wolfr. Hence with your dark demands: let's shape our lives After the merciful lesson of the sun, That gilds our purpose. See the dallying waves Caress invitingly into their bosom My fleet ship's keel, that at her anchor bounds As doth the greyhound at her leader's hand, Following her eye beams after the light roe. Isbr. Away then, away! Thus perish our good Revenge! Unfurl your sails: let all the honest finny folk of ocean, and those fair witty spinsters, the mermaids, follow your luckless boats with mockery: sea serpents and sea-dogs and venomous krakens have mercy on your mercy, and drag you down to the salt water element of pity! What, O! what spirit of our ancestral enemies would dare to whisper through our father's bones the tale of thy apostacy? Deliver him from the Saracens' irons, or the coil of the desert snake, who robbed our sire's grey hairs of a kingdom, his heart of its best loved daughter, and trod him down a despairing beggar to the crowned corpses of our progenitors? Save him, who slew our hopes; who cozened us of our share of this sepulchral planet, whereon our statues should have stood sceptred? Revenge, Revenge lend me your torch, that I may by its bloody fire see the furrows of this man's countenance, which once were iron, like the bars of Hell gate, and devilish thoughts peeped through them; but now are as a cage of very pitiful apes. Wolfr. Should we repent this change? I know not why. We came disguised into the court, stiff limbed With desperate intent, and doubly souled With murder's devil and our own still ghosts. But must I not relent, finding the heart, For which my dagger hungered, so inclined In brotherly affection unto me? O bless the womanish weakness of my soul, Which came to slay, and leads me now to save! Isbr. Hate! Hate! Revenge and blood! These are the first words my boys shall learn. What accursed poison has that Duke, that snake, with his tongue, his fang, dropped into thine ear? Thou art no brother of mine more: his soul was of that tune which shall awaken the dead: for thine! if I could make a trumpet of the devil's antlers, and blow thee through it, my lady's poodle would be scarce moved to a hornpipe. O fie on't! Thou my brother? Say when hast thou undergone transfusion, and whose hostile blood now turns thy life's wheels? Who has poured Lethe into thy veins, and washed thy father out of heart and brains? Ha! be pale, and smile, and be prodigal of thy body's movements, for thou hast no soul more. That thy sire placed in thee; and, with the determination to avenge him, thou hast driven it out of doors. But 'tis well so: why lament? Now I have all the hatred and revenge of the world to myself to abhor and murder him with. Wolfr. Thou speak'st unjustly, what thou rashly think'st; But time must soften and convince: now leave me, If thou hast nothing but reproach for pastime. Isbr. Be angry then, and we will curse each other. But if thou goest now to deliver this man, come not again for fear of me and our father's spirit: for when he visits me in the night, screaming revenge, my heart forgets that my head wears a fool's cap, and dreams of daggers: come not again then! Wolfr. O think not, brother, that our father's spirit Breathes earthy passion more: he is with me And guides me to the danger of his foe, Bringing from heaven, his home, pity and pardon. But, should his blood need bloody expiation, Then let me perish. Blind these eyes, my sire, Palsy my vigorous arm, snow age upon me, Strike me with lightning down into the deep, Open me any grave that earth can spare, Leave me the truth of love, and death is lovely. [Exit. Isbr. O lion-heartedness right asinine! Such lily-livered meek humanity Saves not thy duke, good brother; it but shines Sickly upon his doom, as moonbeams breaking Upon a murderer's grave-digging spade. Or fate's a fool, or I will be his fate. What ho! Sir Knight! One word—Now for a face As innocent and lamblike as the wool That brings a plague. (Re-enter Wolfram.) Wolfr. What will you more with me? Isbr. Go, if you must and will; but take with you At least this letter of the governor's, Which, in your haste, you dropped. I must be honest, For so my hate was ever. Go. Wolfr. And prosper! [Exit. Isbr. Now then he plunges right into the waters! O Lie, O Lie, O lovely lady Lie, They told me that thou art the devil's daughter. Then thou art greater than thy father, Lie; For while he mopes in Hell, thou queen'st it bravely, Ruling the earth under the name of Truth, While she is at the bottom of the well, Where Joseph left her. Song from the ship. To sea, to sea! The calm is o'er; The wanton water leaps in sport, And rattles down the pebbly shore; The dolphin wheels, the sea-cows snort, And unseen Mermaids' pearly song Comes bubbling up, the weeds among. Fling broad the sail, dip deep the oar: To sea, to sea! the calm is o'er. To sea, to sea! our wide-winged bark Shall billowy cleave its sunny way, And with its shadow, fleet and dark, Break the caved Tritons' azure day, Like mighty eagle soaring light O'er antelopes on Alpine height. The anchor heaves, the ship swings free, The sails swell full. To sea, to sea! Isbr. The idiot merriment of thoughtless men! How the fish laugh at them, that swim and toy About the ruined ship, wrecked deep below, Whose pilot's skeleton, all full of sea weeds, Leans on his anchor, grinning like their Hope. But I will turn my bosom now to thee, Brutus, thou saint of the avenger's order; Refresh me with thy spirit, or pour in Thy whole great ghost. Isbrand, thou tragic fool, Cheer up. Art thou alone? Why so should be Creators and destroyers. I'll go brood, And strain my burning and distracted soul Against the naked spirit of the world, Till some portent's begotten. Scene II. The African Coast: a woody solitude near the sea. In the back ground ruins overshadowed by the characteristic vegetation of the oriental regions. The Duke and Sibylla; the latter sleeping in a tent. Duke. Soft sleep enwrap thee: with his balm bedew Thy young fair limbs, Sibylla: thou didst need The downy folding of his arms about thee. And wake not yet, for still the starless night Of our misfortune holds its ghostly noon. No serpent shall creep o'er the sand to sting thee, No springing tiger, no uncouth sea-monster, (For such are now the partners of thy chamber,) Disturb thy rest: only the birds shall dare To shake the sparkling blossoms that hang o'er thee, And fan thee with their wings. As I watch for thee, So may the power, that has so far preserved us, Now in the uttermost, now that I feel The cold drops on my forehead, and scarce know Whether Fear shed them there, or the near breath Of our pursuing foes has settled on it, Stretch its shield o'er us. Enter Ziba. What bring'st, Ziba? Hope? Else be as dumb as that thou bring'st, Despair. Ziba. Fruits: as I sat among the boughs, and robbed The sparrows and their brothers of their bread, A horde of casqued Saracens rode by, Each swearing that thy sword should rest ere night Within his sheath, his weapon in thy breast. Duke. Speak lower, Ziba, lest the lady wake. Perhaps she sleeps not, but with half-shut eyes Will hear her fate. The slaves shall need to wash My sword of Moslem blood before they sheath it. Which path took they? Ziba. Sleeping, or feigning sleep, Well done of her: 'tis trying on a garb Which she must wear, sooner or later, long: 'Tis but a warmer lighter death. The ruffians, Of whom I spoke, turned towards the cedar forest, And, as they went in, there rushed forth a lion And tore their captain down. Long live the lion! We'll drink his tawny health: he gave us wine. For, while the Moors in their black fear were flying, I crept up to the fallen wretch, and borrowed His flask of rubious liquor. May the prophet Forgive him, as I do, for carrying it! This for to-day: to-morrow hath gods too, Who'll ripen us fresh berries, and uncage Another lion on another foe. Duke. Brave Arab, thanks. But saw'st thou from the heights No christian galley steering for this coast? Ziba. I looked abroad upon the wide old world, And in the sky and sea, through the same clouds, The same stars saw I glistening, and nought else. And as my soul sighed unto the world's soul, Far in the north a wind blackened the waters, And, after that creating breath was still, A dark speck sat on the sky's edge: as watching Upon the heaven-girt border of my mind The first faint thought of a great deed arise, With force and fascination I drew on The wished sight, and my hope seemed to stamp Its shape upon it. Not yet is it clear What, or from whom, the vessel. Duke. Liberty! Thou breakest through our dungeon's wall of waves, As morning bursts the towery spell of night. Horse of the desert, thou, coy arrowy creature, Startest like sunrise up, and, from thy mane Shaking abroad the dews of slumber, boundest With sparkling hoof along the scattered sands, The livelong day in liberty and light. But see, the lady stirs. Once more look out, And thy next news be safety. [Exit Ziba. Hast thou gathered Rest and refreshment from thy desert couch, My fair Sibylla? Sibyl. Deeply have I slept. As one who hath gone down unto the springs Of his existence and there bathed, I come Regenerate up into the world again. Kindest protector, 'tis to thee I owe This boon, a greater than my parents gave. Me, who had never seen this earth, this heaven, The sun, the stars, the flowers, but shut from nature Within my dungeon birthplace lived in darkness, Me hast thou freed from the oppressor's chain, And godlike given me this heaven, this earth, The flowers, the stars, the sun. Methinks it were Ingratitude to thank thee for a gift So measurelessly great. Duke. As yet, sweet lady, I have deserved but little thanks of thine. We've not yet broken prison. This wall of waves Still towers between us and the world of men; That too I hope to climb. Our true Egyptian Hath brought me news of an approaching ship. When that hath borne thee to our German shore, And thou amongst the living tastest life, And gallants shall have shed around thy presence A glory of the starry looks of love, For thee to move in, thank me then. Sibyl. I wish not To leave this shady quiet bower of life. Why should we seek cruel mankind again? Nature is kinder far: and every thing That lives around us, with its pious silence, Gives me delight: the insects, and the birds That come unto our table, seeking food, The flowers, upon whose petals Night lays down Her dewy necklace, are my dearest playmates. O let us never leave them. Duke. That would be To rob thy fate of thee. In other countries Another godliker mankind doth dwell, Whose works each day adorn and deify The world their fathers left them. Thither shalt thou, For among them must be the one thou'rt born for. Durst thou be such a traitress to thy beauty As to live here unloving and unloved? Sibyl. Love I not thee? O, if I feel beside thee Content and an unruffled calm, in which My soul doth gather round thee, to reflect Thy heavenly goodness: if I feel my heart So full of comfort near thee, that no room For any other wish, no doubt, remains; Love I not thee? Duke. Dear maiden, thou art young. Thou must see many, and compare their merits Ere thou canst choose. Esteem and quiet friendship Oft bear Love's semblance for awhile. Sibyl. I know it; Thou shalt hear how. A year and more is past Since a brave Saxon knight did share our prison; A noble generous man, in whose discourse I found much pleasure: yet, when he was near me, There ever was a pain which I could taste Even in the thick and sweetest of my comfort: Strange dread of meeting, greater dread of parting: My heart was never still: and many times, When he had fetched me flowers, I trembled so That oft they fell as I was taking them Out of his hand. When I would speak to him I heard not, and I knew not what I said. I saw his image clearer in his absence Than near him, for my eyes were strangely troubled; And never had I dared to talk thus to him. Yet this I thought was Love. O self deceived! For now I can speak all I think to thee With confidence and ease. What else can that be Except true love? Duke. The like I bear to thee, O more than all that thou hast promised me: For if another being stepped between us, And were he my best friend, I must forget All vows, and cut his heart away from mine. Sibyl. Think not on that: it is impossible. Duke. Yet, my Sibylla, oft first love must perish; Like the poor snow-drop, boyish love of Spring, Born pale to die, and strew the path of triumph Before the imperial glowing of the rose, Whose passion conquers all. Enter Ziba. Ziba. O my dear lord, we're saved! Duke. How? Speak quickly. Though every word hath now no meaning in't, Since thou hast said ‘she's saved.’ Ziba. The ship is in the bay, a christian knight Steps from his boat upon the shore. Duke. Blest hour! And yet how palely, with what faded lips Do we salute this unhoped change of fortune! Thou art so silent, lady; and I utter Shadows of words, like to an ancient ghost, Arisen out of hoary centuries Where none can speak his language. I had thought That I should laugh, and shout, and leap on high: But see this breath of joy hath damped my soul, Melted the icy mail, with which despair Had clad my heart and sealed the springs of weakness: And O! how feeble, faint, and sad I go To welcome what I prayed for. Thou art silent; How art thou then, my love? Sibyl. Now Hope and Fear Stand by me, masked in one another's shapes; I know not which is which, and, if I did, I doubt which I should choose. Enter a Knight. Knight. Hither, Sir Knight— Duke. What knight? Knight. What knight, but Wolfram? Duke. Wolfram, my knight! Sibyl. My day, my Wolfram! Duke. Know'st him? Sibyl. His foot is on my heart; he comes, he comes. Enter Wolfram, knights and attendants. Wolfr. Are these thy comrades? Then, Arab, thy life's work and mine is done. My duke, my brother knight! Duke. O friend! So call me! Wolfram, thou comest to us like a god, Giving life where thou touchest with thy hand. Wolfr. Were it mine own, I'd break it here in twain, And give you each a half. Duke. I will not thank thee, I will not welcome thee, embrace and bless thee; Nor will I weep in silence. Gratitude, Friendship, and Joy are beggar'd, and turned forth Out of my heart for shallow hypocrites: They understand me not; and my soul, dazzled, Stares on the unknown feelings that now crowd it, Knows none of them, remembers none, counts none, More than a new-born child in its first hour. One word, and then we'll speak of this no more: At parting each of us did tear a leaf Out of a magic book, and, robbing life Of the red juice with which she feeds our limbs, We wrote a mutual bond. Dost thou remember? Wolfr. And if a promise reaches o'er the grave My ghost shall not forget it. There I swore That, if I died before thee, I would come With the first weeds that shoot out of my grave, And bring thee tidings of our real home. Duke. That bond hast thou now cancelled thus; or rather Unto me lying in my sepulchre Comest thou, and say'st, “Arise and live again.” Wolfr. And with thee dost thou bring some angel back. Look on me, lady. Sibyl (aside). Pray heaven, it be not The angel of the death of one of you, To make the grave and the flowers' roots amends. Now turn I to thee, knight. O dared I hope, Thou hast forgotten me! Wolfr. Then dead indeed Were I, and my soul disinherited Of immortality, which love of thee Gave me the proof of first. Forgotten thee! Ay; if thou be not she, with whom I shared Few months ago that dungeon, which thy presence Lit with delight unknown to liberty; If thou be not Sibylla, she whose semblance Here keepeth watch upon my breast. Behold it: Morning and night my heart doth beat against it. Thou gavest it me one day, when I admired, Above all crystal gems, a dewdrop globe Which, in the joyous dimple of a flower, Imaged thee tremulously. Since that time Many a secret tear hath mirrored thee, And many a thought, over this pictured beauty. Speak to me then: or art thou, as this toy, Only the likeness of the maid I loved? But there's no seeming such a one. O come! This talking is a pitiful invention: We'll leave it to the wretched. All my science, My memory, I'd give for this one joy, And keep it ever secret. Sibyl. Wolfram, thou movest me: With soul-compelling looks thou draw'st me to thee: O! at thy call I must surrender me, My lord, my love, my life. Duke. Thy life! O lives, that dwell In these three bosoms, keep your footings fast, For there's a blasting thought stirring among you. They love each other. Silence! Let them love; And let him be her love. She is a flower, Growing upon a grave. Now, gentle lady, Retire, beseech you, to the tent and rest. My friend and I have need to use those words Which are bequeathed unto the miserable. Come hither; you have made me master of them: Who dare be wretched in the world beside me? Think now what you have done; and tremble at it. But I forgive thee, love. Go in and rest thee. Sibyl. And he? Duke. Is he not mine? Wolfr. Go in, sweet, fearlessly. I come to thee, before thou'st time to feel That I am absent. [Exit Sibylla, followed by the rest. Duke. Wolfram, we have been friends. Wolfr. And will be ever. I know no other way to live. Duke. 'Tis pity. I would you had been one day more at sea. Wolfr. Why so? Duke. You're troublesome to-day. Have you not marked it? Wolfr. Alas! that you should say so. Duke. That's all needless. Those times are past, forgotten. Hear me, knight: That lady's love is mine. Now you know that, Do what you dare. Wolfr. The lady! my Sibylla! I would I did not love thee for those words, That I might answer well. Duke. Unless thou yield'st her— For thou hast even subdued her to thy arms, Against her will and reason, wickedly Torturing her soul with spells and adjurations,— Unless thou giv'st her the free will again To take her natural course of being on, Which flowed towards me with gentle love:—O Wolfram, Thou know'st not how she filled my soul so doing, Even as the streams an ocean:—Give her me, And we are friends again. But I forget: Thou lovest her too; a stern, resolved rival; And passionate, I know. Nay then, speak out: 'Twere better that we argued warmly here, Till the blood has its way. Wolfr. Unworthy friend! My lord— Duke. Forget that I am so, and many things Which we were to each other, and speak out. I would we had much wine; 'twould bring us sooner To the right point. Wolfr. Can it be so? O Melveric! I thought thou wert the very one of all Who shouldst have heard my secret with delight. I thought thou wert my friend. Duke. Such things as these, Friendship, esteem, faith, hope, and sympathy, We need no more: away with them for ever! Wilt follow them out of the world? Thou see'st All human things die and decay around us. 'Tis the last day for us; and we stand bare To let our cause be tried. See'st thou not why? We love one creature: which of us shall tear her Out of his soul? I have in all the world Little to comfort me, few that do name me With titles of affection, and but one Who came into my soul at its night-time, As it hung glistening with starry thoughts Alone over its still eternity, And gave it godhead. Thou art younger far, More fit to be beloved; when thou appearest All hearts incline to thee, all prouder spirits Are troubled unto tears and yearn to love thee. O, if thou knew'st thy heart-compelling power, Thou wouldst not envy me the only creature That holds me dear. If I were such as thou, I would not be forgetful of our friendship, But yield to the abandoned his one joy. Wolfr. Thou prob'st me to the quick: before to-day, Methought thou could'st from me nothing demand And I refuse it. Duke. Wolfram, I do beseech thee; The love of her's my heaven; thrust me not from her; I have no hope elsewhere: thrust me not from her; Or thou dost hurl me into hell's embrace, Making me the devil's slave to thy perdition. Wolfr. O, would to heaven, That I had found thee struggling in a battle, Alone against the swords of many foes! Then had I rescued thee, and died content, Ignorant of the treasure I had saved thee. But now my fate hath made a wisher of me: O woe that so it is! O woe to wish That she had never been, who is the cause! Duke. He is the cause! O fall the curse on him, And may he be no more, who dares the gods With such a wish! Speak thou no more of love, No more of friendship here: the world is open: I wish you life and merriment enough From wealth and wine, and all the dingy glory Fame doth reward those with, whose love-spurned hearts Hunger for goblin immortality. Live long, grow old, and honour crown thy hairs, When they are pale and frosty as thy heart. Away. I have no better blessing for thee. Wilt thou not leave me? Wolfr. Should I leave thee thus? Duke. Why not? or must I hate thee perfectly? And tell thee so? Away now I beseech you! Have I not cut all ties betwixt us off? Why, wert thou my own soul, I'd drive thee from me. Go, put to sea again. Wolfr. Farewell then, Duke. Methinks thy better self indeed hath parted, And that I follow. [Exit. Duke. Thither? Thither? Traitor To every virtue. Ha! What's this thought, Shapeless and shadowy, that keeps wheeling round, Like a dumb creature that sees coming danger, And breaks its heart trying in vain to speak? I know the moment: 'tis a dreadful one, Which in the life of every one comes once; When, for the frighted hesitating soul, High heaven and luring sin with promises Bid and contend: oft the faltering spirit, O'ercome by the fair fascinating fiend, Gives her eternal heritage of life For one caress, for one triumphant crime.— Pitiful villain! that dost long to sin, And dar'st not. Shall I dream my soul is bathing In his reviving blood, yet lose my right, My only health, my sole delight on earth, For fear of shadows on a chapel wall In some pale painted Hell? No: by thy beauty, I will possess thee, maiden. Doubt and care Be trampled in the dust with the worm conscience! Farewell then, Wolfram: now Amen is said Unto thy time of being in this world: Thou shalt die. Ha! the very word doth double My strength of life: the resolution leaps Into my heart divinely, as doth Mars Upon the trembling footboard of his car, Hurrying into battle wild and panting, Even as my death-dispensing thought does now. Ho! Ziba! Enter Ziba. Hush! How still, how full, how lightly I move since this resolve, about the place, Like to a murder-charged thunder cloud Lurking about the starry streets of night, Breathless and masked, O'er a still city sleeping by the sea. Ziba, come hither; thou'rt the night I'll hang My muffled wrath in. Come, I'll give thee work Shall make thy life still darker, for one light on't Must be put out. O let me joy no more, Till Fate hath kissed my wooing soul's desire Off her death-honied lips, and so set seal To my decree, in which he's sepulchred. Come, Ziba, thou must be my counsellor. [Exeunt. Scene III. A Tent on the sea-shore: sun-set. Wolfram and Sibylla. Wolfr. This is the oft-wished hour, when we together May walk upon the sea-shore: let us seek Some greensward overshadowed by the rocks. Wilt thou come forth? Even now the sun is setting In the triumphant splendour of the waves. Hear you not how they leap? Sibyl. Nay; we will watch The sun go down upon a better day: Look not on him this evening. Wolfr. Then let's wander Under the mountain's shade in the deep valley, And mock the woody echoes with our songs. Sibyl. That wood is dark, and all the mountain caves Dreadful, and black, and full of howling winds: Thither we will not wander. Wolfr. Shall we seek The green and golden meadows, and there pluck Flowers for thy couch, and shake the dew out of them? Sibyl. The snake that loves the twilight is come out, Beautiful, still, and deadly; and the blossoms Have shed their fairest petals in the storm Last night; the meadow's full of fear and danger. Wolfr. Ah! you will to the rocky fount, and there We'll see the fire-flies dancing in the breeze, And the stars trembling in the trembling water, And listen to the daring nightingale Defying the old night with harmony. Sibyl. Nor that: but we will rather here remain, And earnestly converse. What said the Duke? Surely no good. Wolfr. A few unmeaning words, I have almost forgotten. Sibyl. Tell me truly, Else I may fear much worse. Wolfr. Well: it may be That he was somewhat angry. 'Tis no matter; He must soon cool and be content. Enter Ziba. Ziba. Hail, knight! I bring to thee the draught of welcome. Taste it. The Grecian sun ripened it in the grape, Which Grecian maidens plucked and pressed: then came The desart Arab to the palace gate, And took it for his tribute. It is charmed; And they who drink of such have magic dreams. Wolfr. Thanks for thy care. I'll taste it presently: Right honey for such bees as I. Enter a Knight. Knight. Up, brave Wolfram! Arouse thee, and come forth to help and save. Wolfr. Here is my sword. Who needs it? Sibyl. Is't the Duke? O my dark Fear! Knight. 'Tis he. Hunting in the forest, A band of robbers rushed on us. Wolfr. How many? Knight. Some twelve to five of us; and in the fight, Which now is at the hottest, my sword failed me. Up, good knight, in all speed: I'll lead the way. Wolfr. Sibylla, what deserves he at our hands? Sibyl. Assist him; he preserved me. Wolfr. For what end? Sibyl. Death's sickle points thy questions. No delay: But hence. Enter a second Knight. Wolfr. Behold another from the field,— Thy news? 2nd Knight. My fellow soldiers all Bleed and grow faint: fresh robbers pour upon us, And the Duke stands at bay unhelmed against them. Wolfr. Brave comrade, keep the rogues before thee, dancing At thy sword's point, but a few moments longer; Then I am with thee. Farewell thou, Sibylla; He shall not perish thus. Rise up, my men, To horse with sword and spear, and follow flying. I pledge thee, lady. (takes the goblet) Ziba (dashing it to the ground). Flow wine, like Moorish gore. Ha! it rings well and lies not. 'Tis right metal For funeral bells. Wolfr. Slave, what hast thou done? Ziba. Pour thou unto the subterranean gods Libations of thy blood: I have shed wine. Now, will ye not away? Wolfr. Come hither, dark one: Say, on thy life, why hast thou spilt that wine? Ziba. A superstitious fancy: but now hence. 'Twas costly liquor too. Wolfr. Then finish it. 'Twas well that fortune did reserve for you These last and thickest drops here at the bottom. Ziba. Drink them? forbid the prophet! Wolfr. Slave, thou diest else. Ziba. Give me the beaker then.—O God, I dare not. Death is too bitter so: alas! 'tis poison. Sibyl. Pernicious caitiff! Wolfr. Patience, my Sibylla! I knew it by thy lying eye. Thou'rt pardoned. I may not tread upon the toothless serpent. But for thy lord, the Saracen deal with him As he thinks fit. Wolfram can aid no murderer. Sibyl. Mercy! O let me not cry out in vain: Forgive him yet. Wolfr. The crime I do forgive: And Heaven, if he's forgiven there, preserve him! O monstrous! in the moment when my heart Looked back on him with the old love again, Then was I marked for slaughter by his hand. Forgive him? 'Tis enough: 'tis much. Lie still Thou sworded hand, and thou be steely, heart. Enter a third Knight wounded. 3rd Knight. Woe! woe! Duke Melveric is the Arabs' captive. Sibyl. Then Heaven have mercy on him! Wolfr. So 'tis best: He was o'erthrown and mastered by his passion, As by a tiger. Death will burst the fetters. 3rd Knight. They bind him to a pillar in the desart, And aim their poisoned arrows at his heart. Wolfr. O Melveric, why didst thou so to me? Sibylla, I despise this savage Duke, But thus he shall not die. No man in bonds Can be my enemy. He once was noble; Once very noble. Let me set him free, And we can then be knightly foes again. Up, up, my men, once more and follow me. I bring him to thee, love, or ne'er return. Sibyl. A thousand tearful thanks for this. O Wolfram! [Exeunt severally. Scene IV. A forest: the moonlit sea glistens between the trees. Enter Arabs with the Duke. 1st Arab. Against this column: there's an ancient beast Here in the neighbourhood, which to-night will thank us For the ready meal. [they bind the Duke against a column. 2nd Arab. Christian, to thy houris Boast that we took thy blood in recompense Of our best comrades. 1st Arab. Hast a saint or mistress? Call on them, for next minute comes the arrow. Duke. O Wolfram! now methinks thou lift'st the cup. Strike quickly, Arab. 1st. Arab. Brothers, aim at him. Enter Wolfram and knights. Wolfr. Down, murderers, down. 2nd Arab. Fly! there are hundreds on us. (Fight—the Arabs are beaten out and pursued by the knights.) Wolfr. (unbinding the Duke) Thank heaven, not too late! Now you are free. There is your life again. Duke. Hast thou drunk wine? Answer me, knight, hast thou drunk wine this evening? Wolfr. Nor wine, nor poison. The slave told me all. O Melveric, if I deserve it from thee, Now canst thou mix my draught. But be't forgotten. Duke. And wilt thou not now kill me? Wolfr. Let us strive Henceforward with good deeds against each other, And may you conquer there. Hence, and for ever, No one shall whisper of that deadly thought. Now we will leave this coast. Duke. Ay, we will step Into a boat and steer away: but whither? Think'st thou I'll live in the vile consciousness That I have dealt so wickedly and basely, And been of thee so like a god forgiven? No: 'tis impossible .. Friend, by your leave— [takes a sword from a fallen Arab. O what a coward villain must I be, So to exist. Wolfr. Be patient but awhile, And all such thoughts will soften. Duke. The grave be patient, That's yawning at our feet for one of us. I want no comfort. I am comfortable, As any soul under the eaves of Heaven: For one of us must perish in this instant. Fool, would thy virtue shame and crush me down; And make a grateful blushing bondslave of me? O no! I dare be wicked still: the murderer, My thought has christened me, I must remain. O curse thy meek, forgiving, idiot heart, That thus must take its womanish revenge, And with the loathliest poison, pardon, kill me: Twice-sentenced, die! [Strikes at Wolfram. Wolfr. Madman, stand off. Duke. I pay my thanks in steel. Thus be all pardoners pardoned. [Fight: Wolfram falls. Wolfr. Murderer! mine and my father's! O my brother, Too true thy parting words .. Repent thou never! Duke. So then we both are blasted: but thou diest, Who daredst to love athwart my love, discover, And then forgive, my treachery. Now proclaim me. Let my name burn through all dark history Over the waves of time, as from a light-house, Warning approach. My worldly work is done. Ziba runs in. Ziba. They come, they come; if thy thought be not yet Incarnate in a deed, it is too late. Is it a deed? Duke. Look at me. Ziba. 'Tis enough. Duke. See'st? Know'st? Be silent and be gone. [Ziba retires: the knights re-enter with Sibylla. Knight. O luckless victory! our leader wounded! Sibyl. Bleeding to death! and he, whom he gave life to, Even his own, unhurt and armed! Speak, Wolfram: Let me not think thou'rt dying. Wolfr. But I am: Slain villanously. Had I stayed, Sibylla— But thou and life are lost; so I'll be silent. Sibyl. O Melveric, why kneel'st not thou beside him? Weep'st not with me? For thee he fell. O speak! Who did this, Wolfram? Wolfr. 'Tis well done, my Sibylla: So burst the portals of sepulchral night Before the immortal rising of the sun. Sibyl. Who did this, Melveric? Duke. Let him die in quiet. Hush! there's a thought upon his lips again. Wolfr. A kiss, Sibylla! I ne'er yet have kissed thee, And my new bride, death's lips are cold, they say. Now it is darkening. Sibyl. O not yet, not yet! Who did this, Wolfram? Wolfr. Thou know'st, Melveric: At the last day reply thou to that question, When such an angel asks it: I'll not answer Or then or now. [Dies. (Sibylla throws herself on the body; the Duke stands motionless; the rest gather round in silence. The scene closes.) A voice from the waters. The swallow leaves her nest, The soul my weary breast; But therefore let the rain On my grave Fall pure; for why complain? Since both will come again O'er the wave. The wind dead leaves and snow Doth hurry to and fro; And, once, a day shall break O'er the wave, When a storm of ghosts shall shake The dead, until they wake In the grave. ACT II. Scene I. The interior of a church at Ancona. The Duke, in the garb of a pilgrim, Sibylla and Knights, assembled round the corpse of Wolfram, which is lying on a bier. Dirge. If thou wilt ease thine heart Of love and all its smart, Then sleep, dear, sleep; And not a sorrow Hang any tear on your eyelashes; Lie still and deep, Sad soul, until the sea-wave washes The rim o' the sun to-morrow, In eastern sky. But wilt thou cure thine heart Of love and all its smart, Then die, dear, die; 'Tis deeper, sweeter, Than on a rose bank to lie dreaming With folded eye; And then alone, amid the beaming Of love's stars, thou'lt meet her In eastern sky. Knight. These rites completed, say your further pleasure. Duke. To horse and homewards in all haste: my business Urges each hour. This body bury here, With all due honours. I myself will build A monument, whereon, in after times, Those of his blood shall read his valiant deeds, And see the image of the bodily nature He was a man in. Scarcely dare I, lady, Mock you with any word of consolation: But soothing care, and silence o'er that sorrow, Which thine own tears alone may tell to thee Or offer comfort for; and in all matters What thy will best desires, I promise thee. Wilt thou hence with us? Sibyl. Whither you will lead me. My will lies there, my hope, and all my life Which was in this world. Yet if I shed tear, It is not for his death, but for my life. Dead is he? Say not so, but that he is No more excepted from Eternity. If he were dead I should indeed despair. Can Wolfram die? Ay, as the sun doth set: It is the earth that falls away from light; Fixed in the heavens, although unseen by us, The immortal life and light remains triumphant. And therefore you shall never see me wail, Or drop base waters of an ebbing sorrow; No wringing hands, no sighings, no despair, No mourning weeds will I betake me to; But keep my thought of him that is no more, As secret as great nature keeps his soul, From all the world; and consecrate my being To that divinest hope, which none can know of Who have not laid their dearest in the grave. Farewell, my love,—I will not say to thee Pale corpse,—we do not part for many days. A little sleep, a little waking more, And then we are together out of life. Duke. Cover the coffin up. This cold, calm stare Upon familiar features is most dreadful: Methinks too the expression of the face Is changed, since all was settled gently there; And threatens now. But I have sworn to speak And think of that no more, which has been done— Now then into the bustle of the world! We'll rub our cares smooth there. Knight. This gate, my lord; There stand the horses. Duke. Then we're mounted straight. But, pri'thee friend, forget not that the Duke Is still in prison: I am a poor pilgrim. [Exeunt. Enter Isbrand and Siegfried attended. Isbr. Dead and gone! a scurvy burthen to this ballad of life. There lies he, Siegfried; my brother, mark you; and I weep not, nor gnash the teeth, nor curse: and why not, Siegfried? Do you see this? So should every honest man be: cold, dead, and leaden-coffined. This was one who would be constant in friendship, and the pole wanders: one who would be immortal, and the light that shines upon his pale forehead now, through yonder gewgaw window, undulated from its star hundreds of years ago. That is constancy, that is life. O moral nature! Siegfr. 'Tis well that you are reconciled to his lot and your own. Isbr. Reconciled! A word out of a love tale, that's not in my language. No, no. I am patient and still and laborious, a good contented man; peaceable as an ass chewing a thistle; and my thistle is revenge. I do but whisper it now: but hereafter I will thunder the word, and I shall shoot up gigantic out of this pismire shape, and hurl the bolt of that revenge. Siegfr. To the purpose: the priests return to complete the burial. Isbr. Right: we are men of business here. Away with the body, gently and silently; it must be buried in my duke's chapel in Silesia: why, hereafter. (The body is borne out by attendants) That way, fellows: the hearse stands at the corner of the square: but reverently, 'tis my brother you carry. [Exeunt. Scene II. A hall in the ducal castle of Munsterberg in the town of Grüssau in Silesia. Thorwald, Adalmar, Athulf, Isbrand, Siegfried; the Duke, disguised as a pilgrim; Amala; and other ladies and knights; conversing in various groups. Athulf. A fair and bright assembly: never strode Old arched Grüssau over such a tide Of helmed chivalry, as when to-day Our tourney guests swept, leaping billow-like, Its palace-banked streets. Knights shut in steel, Whose shields, like water, glassed the soul-eyed maidens, That softly did attend their armed tread, Flower-cinctured on the temples, whence gushed down A full libation of star-numbered tresses, Hallowing the neck unto love's silent kiss, Veiling its innocent white: and then came squires, And those who bore war's silken tapestries, And chequered heralds: 'twas a human river, Brimful and beating as if the great god, Who lay beneath it, would arise. So sways Time's sea, which Age snows into and makes deep, When, from the rocky side of the dim future, Leaps into it a mighty destiny, Whose being to endow great souls have been Centuries hoarded, and the world meanwhile Sate like a beggar upon Heaven's threshold, Muttering its wrongs. Siegfr. My sprightly Athulf, Is it possible that you can waste the day, Which throws these pillared shades among such beauties, In lonely thought? Athulf. Why I have left my cup, A lady's lips, dropping with endless kisses, Because your minstrels hushed their harps. Why did they? This music, which they tickle from the strings, Is excellent for drowning ears that gape, When one has need of whispers. Siegfr. The old governor Would have it so: his morning nap being o'er, He's no more need of music, but is moving Straight to the lists. Athulf. A curse on that mock war! How it will shake and sour the blood, that now Is quiet in the men! And there's my brother, Whose sword's his pleasure. A mere savage man, Made for the monstrous times, but left out then, Born by mistake with us. Adalm. (to Isbrand) Be sure 'tis heavy. Once lance of mine a wolf shut his jaws on But cracked it not, you'll see his bite upon it: It lies among the hunting weapons. Isbr. Ay, With it I saw you once scratch out of life A blotted Moor. Adalm. The same; it poises well, And falls right heavy: find it. [Exit Isbrand. Siegfr. For the tilt, My brave lord Adalmar? Athulf. What need of asking? You know the man is sore upon a couch; But upright, on his bloody-hoofed steed Galloping o'er the ruins of his foes, Whose earthquake he hath been, then will he shout, Laugh, run his tongue along his trembling lip, And swear his heart tastes honey. Siegfr. Nay, thou'rt harsh; He was the axe of Mars; but, Troy being felled, Peace trims her bower with him. Athulf. Ay; in her hand He's iron still. Adalm. I care not, brother Athulf, Whether you're right or wrong: 'tis very certain, Thank God for it, I am not Peace's lap-dog, But Battle's shaggy whelp. Perhaps, even soon, Good friend of Bacchus and the rose, you'll feel Your budding wall of dalliance shake behind you, And need my spear to prop it. Athulf. Come the time! You'll see that in our veins runs brother's blood. A Lady. Is Siegfried here? At last! I've sought for you By every harp and every lady's shoulder, Not ever thinking you could breathe the air That ducal cub of Munsterberg makes frightful With his loud talk. Siegfr. Happy in my error, If thus to be corrected. Re-enter Isbrand. Isbr. The lance, my lord: A delicate tool to breathe a heathen's vein with. The Lady. What, Isbrand, thou a soldier? Fie upon thee! Is this a weapon for a fool? Isbr. Madam, I pray thee pardon us. The fair have wrested the tongue from us, and we must give our speeches a tongue of some metal—steel or gold. And I beseech thee, lady, call me fool no more: I grow old, and in old age you know what men become. We are at court, and there it were sin to call a thing by its right name: therefore call me a fool no longer, for my wisdom is on the wane, and I am almost as sententious as the governor. The Lady. Excellent: wilt thou become court-confessor? Isbr. Ay, if thou wilt begin with thy secrets, lady. But my fair mistress, and you, noble brethren, I pray you gather around me. I will now speak a word in earnest, and hereafter jest with you no more: for I lay down my profession of folly. Why should I wear bells to ring the changes of your follies on? Doth the besonneted moon wear bells, she that is the parasite and zany of the stars, and your queen, ye apes of madness? As I live I grow ashamed of the duality of my legs, for they and the apparel, forked or furbelowed, upon them constitute humanity; the brain no longer: and I wish I were an honest fellow of four shins when I look into the note-book of your absurdities. I will abdicate. The Lady. Brave! but how dispose of your dominions most magnanimous zany? Isbr. My heirs at law are manifold. Yonder minister shall have my jacket; he needs many colours for his deeds. You shall inherit my mantle; for your sins, (be it whispered,) chatter with the teeth for cold; and charity, which should be their great-coat, you have not in the heart. The Lady. Gramercy: but may I not beg your coxcomb for a friend? Isbr. The brothers have an equal claim to that crest: they may tilt for it. But now for my crown. O cap and bells, ye eternal emblems, hieroglyphics of man's supreme right in nature; O ye, that only fall on the deserving, while oak, palm, laurel, and bay rankle on their foreheads, whose deserts are oft more payable at the other extremity: who shall be honoured with you? Come candidates, the cap and bells are empty. The Lady. Those you should send to England, for the bad poets and the critics who praise them. Isbr. Albeit worthy, those merry men cannot this once obtain the prize. I will yield Death the crown of folly. He hath no hair, and in this weather might catch cold and die: besides he has killed the best knight I knew, Sir Wolfram, and deserves it. Let him wear the cap, let him toll the bells; he shall be our new court-fool: and, when the world is old and dead, the thin wit shall find the angel's record of man's works and deeds, and write with a lipless grin on the innocent first page for a title, ‘Here begins Death's Jest-book.’—There, you have my testament: henceforth speak solemnly to me, and I will give a measured answer, having relapsed into court-wisdom again. The Lady. How the wild jester would frighten us! Come, Siegfried: Some of us in a corner wait your music, Your news, and stories. My lord Adalmar, You must be very weary all this time, The rest are so delighted. Come along, [to Siegfr. Or else his answer stuns me. Adalm. Joyous creature! Whose life's first leaf is hardly yet uncurled. Athulf. Use your trade's language; were I journeyman To Mars, the glorious butcher, I would say She's sleek, and sacrificial flowers would look well On her white front. Adalm. Now, brother, can you think, Stern as I am above, that in my depth There is no cleft wherein such thoughts are hived As from dear looks and words come back to me, Storing that honey, love. O! love I do, Through every atom of my being. Athulf. Ay, So do we young ones all. In winter time This god of butterflies, this Cupid sleeps, As they do in their cases; but May comes; With it the bee and he: each spring of mine He sends me a new arrow, thank the boy. A week ago he shot me for this year; The shaft is in my stomach, and so large There's scarcely room for dinner. Adalm. Shall I believe thee, Or judge mortality by this stout sample I screw my mail o'er? Well, it may be so; You are an adept in these chamber passions, And have a heart that's Cupid's arrow cushion Worn out with use. I never knew before The meaning of this love. But one has taught me, It is a heaven wandering among men, The spirit of gone Eden haunting earth. Life's joys, death's pangs are viewless from its bosom, Which they who keep are gods: there's no paradise, There is no heaven, no angels, no blessed spirits, No souls, or they have no eternity, If this be not a part of them. Athulf. This in a Court! Such sort of love might Hercules have felt Warm from the Hydra fight, when he had fattened On a fresh slain Bucentaur, roasted whole, The heart of his pot-belly, till it ticked Like a cathedral clock. But in good faith Is this the very truth? Then have I found My fellow fool. For I am wounded too E'en to the quick and inmost, Adalmar. So fair a creature! of such charms compact As nature stints elsewhere; which you may find Under the tender eyelid of a serpent, Or in the gurge of a kiss-coloured rose, By drops and sparks: but when she moves, you see, Like water from a crystal overfilled, Fresh beauty tremble out of her and lave Her fair sides to the ground. Of other women, (And we have beauteous in this court of ours,) I can remember whether nature touched Their eye with brown or azure, where a vein Runs o'er a sleeping eyelid, like some streak In a young blossom; every grace count up, Here the round turn and crevice of the arm, There the tress-bunches, or the slender hand Seen between harpstrings gathering music from them: But where she is, I'm lost in her abundance, And when she leaves me I know nothing more, (Like one from whose awakening temples rolls The cloudy vision of a god away,) Than that she was divine. Adalm. Fie sir, these are the spiced sighs of a heart, That bubbles under wine; utter rhyme-gilding, Beneath man's sober use. What do you speak of? Athulf. A woman most divine, and that I love As you dare never. Adalm. Boy, a truce with talk. Such words are sacred, placed within man's reach To be used seldom, solemnly, when speaking Of what both God and man might overhear, You unabashed. Athulf. Of what? What is more worthy Than the delight of youth, being so rare, Precious, short-lived, and irrecoverable? Adalm. When you do mention that adored land, Which gives you life, pride, and security, And holy rights of freedom; or in the praise Of those great virtues and heroic men, That glorify the earth and give it beams, Then to be lifted by the like devotion Would not disgrace God's angels. Athulf. Well sir, laud, Worship, and swear by them, your native country And virtues past; a phantom and a corpse: Such airy stuff may please you. My desires Are hot and hungry; they will have their fill Of living dalliance, gazes, and lip-touches, Or eat their master. Now, no more rebuking: Peace be between us. For why are we brothers, Being the creatures of two different gods, But that we may not be each other's murderers? Adalm. So be it then! But mark me, brother Athulf, I spoke not from a cold unnatural spirit, Barren of tenderness. I feel and know Of woman's dignity; how it doth merit Our total being, has all mine this moment: But they should share with us our level lives: Moments there are, and one is now at hand, Too high for them. When all the world is stirred By some preluding whisper of that trumpet, Which shall awake the dead, to do great things, Then the sublimity of my affection, The very height of my beloved, shows me How far above her's glory. When you've earned This knowledge, tell me: I will say, you love As a man should. [He retires. Athulf. But this is somewhat true. I almost think that I could feel the same For her. For her? By heavens 'tis Amala, Amala only, that he so can love. There? by her side? in conference! at smiles! Then I am born to be a fratricide. I feel as I were killing him. Tush, tush; A phantom of my passion! But, if true— What? What, my heart? A strangely-quiet thought, That will not be pronounced, doth answer me. (Thorwald comes forward, attended by the company.) Thorw. Break up! The day's of age. Knights to the lists, And ladies to look on. We'll break some lances Before 'tis evening. To your sports, I pray; I follow quickly. [He is left alone with the Duke. Pilgrim, now your news: Whence come you? Duke. Straightway from the holy land, Whose sanctity such floods of human blood, Unnatural rain for it, will soon wash out. Thorw. You saw our Duke? Duke. I did: but Melveric Is strangely altered. When we saw him leap, Shut up in iron, on his burning steed From Grüssau's threshold, he had fifty years Upon his head, and bore them straight and upright, Through dance, and feast, and knightly tournament. Thorw. How! Is he not the same? 'Tis but three years And a fourth's quarter past. What is the change? A silvering of the hair? a deeper wrinkle On cheek and forehead? Duke. I do not think you'd know him, Stood he where I do. No. I saw him lying Beside a fountain on a battle-evening: The sun was setting over the heaped plain; And to my musing fancy his front's furrows, With light between them, seemed the grated shadow Thrown by the ribs of that field's giant, Death; 'Twixt which the finger of the hour did write ‘This is the grave's.’ Thorw. How? Looked he sorrowful? Knows he the dukedom's state? Duke. (giving letters to Thorwald) Ask these. He's heard The tidings that afflict the souls of fathers; How these two sons of his unfilially Have vaulted to the saddle of the people, And charge against him. How he gained the news, You must know best: what countermine he digs, Those letters tell your eyes. He bade me say, His dukedom is his body, and, he forth, That may be sleeping, but the touch of wrong, The murderer's barefoot tread will bring him back Out of his Eastern visions, ere this earth Has swung the city's length. Thorw. I read as much: He bids me not to move; no eye to open, But to sit still and doze, and warm my feet At their eruption. This security Is most unlike him. I remember oft, When the thin harvests shed their withered grain, And empty poverty yelped sour-mouthed at him, How he would cloud his majesty of form With priestly hangings, or the tattered garb Of the step-seated beggar, and go round To catch the tavern talk and the street ballad, And whispers of ancestral prophecies, Until he knew the very nick of time, When his heart's arrow would be on the string; And, seizing Treason by the arm, would pour Death back upon him. Duke. He is wary still, And has a snake's eye under every grass. Your business is obedience unto him, Who is your natal star; and mine, to worm, Leaf after leaf, into the secret volume Of their designs. Already has our slave, The grape juice, left the side-door of the youngest Open to me. You think him innocent. Fire flashes from him; whether it be such As treason would consult by, or the coals Love boils his veins on, shall through this small crevice, Through which the vine has thrust its cunning tendril, Be looked and listened for. Thorw. Can I believe it? Did not I know him and his spirit's course, Well as the shape and colour of the sun, And when it sets and rises? Is this he? No: 'tis the shadow of this pilgrim false, Who stands up in his height of villany, Shadowy as a hill, and throws his hues Of contradiction to the heavenly light, The stronger as it shines upon him most. Ho! pilgrim, I have weighed and found thee villain. Are thy knees used to kneeling? It may chance That thou wilt change the altar for the block: Prove thou'rt his messenger. Duke. I wait your questions. The very inmost secret of his heart, Confided to you, challenge from me. Thorw. First, A lighter trial. If you come from him, Tell me what friend he spoke of most. Duke. Of thee. Thorw. Another yet; A knight? Duke. There is no living knight his friend. Thorw. O ill guessed, palmer! One, whom Melveric Would give his life, all but his virtue for, Lived he no more, to raise him from the dead. Duke. Right; he would give his soul; Thorwald, his soul:— Friendship is in its depth, and secrets sometimes Like to a grave.—So loved the Duke that warrior. Thorw. Enough, his name;—the name? Duke. Ay, ay, the name— Methinks there's nothing in the world but names: All things are dead; friendship at least I'll blot From my vocabulary. The man was called— The knight—I cannot utter't—the knight's name— Why dost thou ask me? I know nothing of him. I have not seen or heard of him, of—Well, I'll speak of him to no man more— Thorw. Tremble then When thou dost hear of—Wolfram! thou art pale: Confess, or to the dungeon— Duke. Pause! I am stuffed With an o'erwhelming spirit: press not thou, Or I shall burst asunder, and let through The deluging presence of thy duke. Prepare: He's near at hand. Thorw. Forbid it, Providence! He steps on a plot's spring, whose teeth encircle The throne and city. Duke. (disrobing) Fear not. On he comes, Still as a star robed in eclipse, until The earthy shadow slips away. Who rises? I'm changing: now who am I? Thorw. Melveric! Munsterberg, as I live and love thee! Duke. Hush! Is there not danger? Thorw. Ay: we walk on ice Over the mouth of Hell: an inch beneath us, Dragon Rebellion lies ready to wake. Ha! and behold him. Enter Adalmar. Adalm. Lord Governor, our games are waiting for you. Will you come with me? Base and muffled stranger, What dost thou here? Away. Duke. Prince Adalmar, Where shall you see me? I will come again, This or the next world. Thou, who carriest The seeds of a new world, may'st understand me. Look for me ever. There's no crack without me In earth and all around it. Governor, Let all things happen, as they will. Farewell: Tremble for no one. Adalm. Hence! The begging monk Prates emptily. Duke. Believe him. Thorw. Well, lead on; Wert thou a king, I would not more obey thee. [Exit with Adalmar. Duke. Rebellion, treason, parricidal daggers! This is the bark of the court dogs, that come Welcoming home their master. My sons too, Even my sons! O not sons, but contracts, Between my lust and a destroying fiend, Written in my dearest blood, whose date run out, They are become death-warrants. Parricide, And Murder of the heart that loved and nourished, Be merry, ye rich fiends! Piety's dead, And the world left a legacy to you. Under the green-sod are your coffins packed, So thick they break each other. The days come When scarce a lover, for his maiden's hair, Can pluck a stalk whose rose draws not its hue Out of a hate-killed heart. Nature's polluted, There's man in every secret corner of her, Doing damned wicked deeds. Thou art old, world, A hoary atheistic murderous star: I wish that thou would'st die, or could'st be slain, Hell-hearted bastard of the sun. O that the twenty coming years were over! Then should I be at rest, where ruined arches Shut out the troublesome unghostly day; And idlers might be sitting on my tomb, Telling how I did die. How shall I die? Fighting my sons for power; or of dotage, Sleeping in purple pressed from filial veins; To let my epitaph be, “Here lies he, Who murdered his two children?” Hence cursed thought! I will enquire the purpose of their plot: There may be good in it, and, if there be, I'll be a traitor too. [Exit. Scene III. A retired gallery in the ducal castle. Enter Isbrand and Siegfried. Isbr. Now see you how this dragon egg of ours Swells with its ripening plot? Methinks I hear Snaky rebellion turning restless in it, And with its horny jaws scraping away The shell that hides it. All is ready now: I hold the latch-string of a new world's wicket; One pull and it rolls in. Bid all our friends Meet in that ruinous church-yard once again, By moonrise: until then I'll hide myself; For these sweet thoughts rise dimpling to my lips, And break the dark stagnation of my features, Like sugar melting in a glass of poison. To-morrow, Siegfried, shalt thou see me sitting One of the drivers of this racing earth, With Grüssau's reins between my fingers. Ha! Never since Hell laughed at the church, blood-drunken From rack and wheel, has there been joy so mad As that which stings my marrow now. Siegfr. Good cause, The sun-glance of a coming crown to heat you, And give your thoughts gay colours in the steam Of a fermenting brain. Isbr. Not alone that. A sceptre is smooth handling, it is true, And one grows fat and jolly in a chair That has a kingdom crouching under it, With one's name on its collar, like a dog, To fetch and carry. But the heart I have Is a strange little snake. He drinks not wine, When he'd be drunk, but poison: he doth fatten On bitter hate, not love. And, O that duke! My life is hate of him; and, when I tread His neck into the grave, I shall, methinks, Fall into ashes with the mighty joy, Or be transformed into a winged star: That will be all eternal heaven distilled Down to one thick rich minute. This sounds madly, But I am mad when I remember him: Siegfried, you know not why. Siegfr. I never knew That you had quarrelled. Isbr. True: but did you see My brother's corpse? There was a wound on't, Siegfried; He died not gently, nor in a ripe age; And I'll be sworn it was the duke that did it, Else he had not remained in that far land, And sent his knights to us again. Siegfr. I thought He was the duke's close friend. Isbr. Close as his blood: A double-bodied soul they did appear, Rather than fellow hearts. Siegfr. I've heard it told That they did swear and write in their best blood, And her's they loved the most, that who died first Should, on death's holidays, revisit him Who still dwelt in the flesh. Isbr. O that such bond Would move the jailor of the grave to open Life's gate again unto my buried brother, But half an hour! Were I buried, like him, There in the very garrets of death's town, But six feet under earth, (that's the grave's sky,) I'd jump up into life. But he's a quiet ghost; He walks not in the churchyard after dew, But gets to his grave betimes, burning no glow-worms, Sees that his bones are right, and stints his worms Most miserly. If you were murdered, Siegfried, As he was by this duke, should it be so? Siegfr. Here speaks again your passion: what know we Of death's commandments to his subject-spirits, Who are as yet the body's citizens? What seas unnavigable, what wild forests, What castles, and what ramparts there may hedge His icy frontier? Isbr. Tower and roll what may, There have been goblins bold who have stolen passports, Or sailed the sea, or leaped the wall, or flung The drawbridge down, and travelled back again. So would my soul have done. But let it be. At the doom-twilight shall the ducal cut-throat Wake by a tomb-fellow he little dreamt of. Methinks I see them rising with mixed bones, A pair of patch-work angels. Siegfr. What does this mean? Isbr. A pretty piece of kidnapping, that's all. When Melveric's heart's heart, his new-wed wife, Upon the bed whereon she bore these sons, Died, as a blossom does whose inmost fruit Tears it in twain, and in its stead remains A bitter poison-berry: when she died, What her soul left was by her husband laid In the marriage grave, whereto he doth consign Himself being dead. Siegfr. Like a true loving mate. Is not her tomb 'mid the cathedral ruins, Where we to-night assemble? Isbr. Say not her's: A changeling lies there. By black night came I, And, while a man might change two goblet's liquors, I laid the lips of their two graves together, And poured my brother into hers; while she, Being the lightest, floated and ran over. Now lies the murdered where the loved should be; And Melveric the dead shall dream of heaven, Embracing his damnation. There's revenge. But hush! here comes one of my dogs, the princes; To work with you. [Exit Siegfried. Now for another shape; For Isbrand is the handle of the chisels Which Fate, the turner of men's lives, doth use Upon the wheeling world. Enter Athulf. There is a passion Lighting his cheek, as red as brother's hate: If it be so, these pillars shall go down, Shivering each other, and their ruins be My step into a dukedom. Doth he speak? Athulf. Then all the minutes of my life to come Are sands of a great desart, into which I'm banished broken-hearted. Amala, I must think thee a lovely-faced murderess, With eyes as dark and poisonous as nightshade; Yet no, not so; if thou hadst murdered me, It had been charitable. Thou hast slain The love of thee, that lived in my soul's palace And made it holy: now 'tis desolate, And devils of abandonment will haunt it, And call in Sins to come, and drink with them Out of my heart. But now farewell, my love; For thy rare sake I could have been a man One story under god. Gone, gone art thou. Great and voluptuous Sin now seize upon me, Thou paramour of Hell's fire-crowned king, That showedst the tremulous fairness of thy bosom In heaven, and so didst ravish the best angels. Come, pour thy spirit all about my soul, And let a glory of thy bright desires Play round about my temples. So may I Be thy knight and Hell's saint for evermore. Kiss me with fire: I'm thine. Isbr. Doth it run so? A bold beginning: we must keep him up to't. Athulf. Isbrand! Isbr. My prince. Athulf. Come to me. Thou'rt a man I must know more of. There is something in thee, The deeper one doth venture in thy being, That drags us on and down. What dost thou lead to? Art thou a current to some unknown sea Islanded richly, full of syren songs And unknown bliss? Art thou the snaky opening Of a dark cavern, where one may converse With night's dear spirits? If thou'rt one of these, Let me descend thee. Isbr. You put questions to me In an Egyptian or old magic tongue, Which I can ill interpret. Athulf. Passion's hieroglyphics; Painted upon the minutes by mad thoughts, Dungeoned in misery. Isbrand, answer me; Art honest, or a man of many deeds And many faces to them? Thou'rt a plotter, A politician. Say, if there should come A fellow, with his being just abandoned By old desires and hopes, who would do much,— And who doth much upon this grave-paved star, In doing, must sin much,—would quick and straight, Sword-straight and poison-quick, have done with doing; Would you befriend him? Isbr. I can lend an arm To good bold purpose. But you know me not, And I will not be known before my hour. Why come you here wishing to raise the devil, And ask me how? Where are your sacrifices? Eye-water is not his libation, prayers Reach him not through earth's chinks. Bold deeds and thoughts, What men call crimes, are his loved litany; And from all such good angels keep us! Now sir, What makes you fretful? Athulf. I have lost that hope, For which alone I lived. Henceforth my days Are purposeless; there is no reason further Why I should be, or should let others be; No motive more for virtue, for forbearance, Or anything that's good. The hourly need, And the base bodily cravings, must be now The aim of this deserted human engine. Good may be in this world, but not for me; Gentle and noble hearts, but not for me; And happiness, and heroism, and glory, And love, but none for me. Let me then wander Amid their banquets, funerals, and weddings, Like one whose living spirit is Death's Angel. Isbr. What? You have lost your love and so turned sour? And who has ta'en your chair in Amala's heaven? Athulf. My brother, my Cain; Adalmar. Isbr. I'll help thee, prince: When will they marry? Athulf. I could not wish him in my rage to die Sooner: one night I'd give him to dream hells. To-morrow, Isbrand. Isbr. Sudden, by my life. But, out of the black interval, we'll cast Something upon the moment of their joy, Which, should it fail to blot, shall so deform it, That they must write it further down in time. Athulf. Let it be crossed with red. Isbr. Trust but to me: I'll get you bliss. But I am of a sort Not given to affections. Sire and mother And sister I had never, and so feel not Why sin 'gainst them should count so doubly wicked, This side o' th' sun. If you would wound your foe, Get swords that pierce the mind: a bodily slice Is cured by surgeon's butter: let true hate Leap the flesh wall, or fling his fiery deeds Into the soul. So he can marry, Athulf, And then— Athulf. Peace, wicked-hearted slave! Darest thou tempt me? I called on thee for service, But thou wouldst set me at a hellish work, To cut my own damnation out of Lust: Thou'ldst sell me to the fiend. Thou and thy master, That sooty beast the devil, shall be my dogs, My curs to kick and beat when I would have you. I will not bow, nor follow at his bidding, For his hell-throne. No: I will have a god To serve my purpose: Hatred be his name; But 'tis a god, divine in wickedness, Whom I will worship. [Exit. Isbr. Then go where Pride and Madness carry thee; And let that feasted fatness pine and shrink, Till thy ghost's pinched in the tight love-lean body. I see his life, as in a map of rivers, Through shadows, over rocks, breaking its way, Until it meet his brother's, and with that Wrestle and tumble o'er a perilous rock, Bare as Death's shoulder: one of them is lost, And a dark haunted flood creeps deadly on Into the wailing Styx. Poor Amala! A thorny rose thy life is, plucked in the dew, And pitilessly woven with these snakes Into a garland for the King of the grave. [Exit. ACT III. Scene I. An apartment in the ducal castle. The Duke and Thorwald. Duke. Let them be married: give to Adalmar The sweet society of woman's soul, As we impregnate damask swords with odour Pressed from young flowers' bosoms, so to sweeten And purify war's lightning. For the other, Who catches love by eyes, the court has stars, That will take up in his tempestuous bosom The shining place she leaves. Thorw. It shall be done: The bell, that will ring merrily for their bridal, Has but few hours to score first. Duke. Good. I have seen too Our ripe rebellion's ringleaders. They meet By moonrise; with them I: to-night will be Fiends' jubilee, with heaven's spy among them. What else was't that you asked? Thorw. The melancholy lady you brought with you? Duke. Thorwald, I fear her's is a broken heart. When first I met her in the Egyptian prison, She was the rosy morning of a woman; Beauty was rising, but the starry grace Of a calm childhood might be seen in her. But since the death of Wolfram, who fell there, Heaven and one single soul only know how, I have not dared to look upon her sorrow. Thorw. Methinks she's too unearthly beautiful. Old as I am, I cannot look at her, And hear her voice, that touches the heart's core, Without a dread that she will fade o' th' instant. There's too much heaven in her: oft it rises, And, pouring out about the lovely earth, Almost dissolves it. She is tender too; And melancholy is the sweet pale smile, With which she gently doth reproach her fortune. Duke. What ladies tend her? Thorw. My Amala; she will not often see One of the others. Duke. Too much solitude Maintains her in this grief. I will look to't Hereafter; for the present I've enough. We must not meet again before to-morrow. Thorw. I may have something to report . . . Duke. Ho! Ziba. Enter Ziba. Ziba. Lord of my life! Duke. I bought this man of Afric from an Arab, Under the shadow of a pyramid, For many jewels. He hath skill in language; And knowledge is in him root, flower, and fruit, A palm with winged imagination in it, Whose roots stretch even underneath the grave, And on them hangs a lamp of magic science In his soul's deepest mine, where folded thoughts Lie sleeping on the tombs of magi dead: So said his master when he parted with him. I know him skilful, faithful: take him with you; He's fit for many services. Thorw. I'll try him: Wilt thou be faithful, Moor? Ziba. As soul to body. Thorw. Then follow me. Farewell, my noble pilgrim. [Exeunt Thorwald and Ziba. Duke. It was a fascination, near to madness, Which held me subjugated to that maiden. Why do I now so coldly speak of her, When there is nought between us? O! there is, A deed as black as the old towers of Hell. But hence! thou torturing weakness of remorse; 'Tis time when I am dead to think on that: Yet my sun shines; so courage, heart, cheer up: Who should be merrier than a secret villain? [Exit. Scene II. Another room in the same. Sibylla and Amala. Sibyl. I would I were a fairy, Amala, Or knew some of those winged wizard women, Then I could bring you a more precious gift. 'Tis a wild graceful flower, whose name I know not; Call it Sibylla's love, while it doth live; And let it die that you may contradict it, And say my love doth not, so bears no fruit. Take it. I wish that happiness may ever Flow through your days as sweetly and as still, As did the beauty and the life to this Out of its roots. Amala. Thanks, my kind Sibylla: To-morrow I will wear it at my wedding, Since that must be. Sibyl. Art thou then discontented? I thought the choice was thine, and Adalmar A noble warrior worthy of his fortune. Amala. O yes: brave, honourable is my bridegroom, But somewhat cold perhaps. If his wild brother Had but more constancy and less insolence In love, he were a man much to my heart. But, as it is, I must, I will be happy; And Adalmar deserves that I should love him. But see how night o'ertakes us. Good rest, dear: We will no more profane sleep's stillest hour. Sibyl. Good night, then. [Exeunt. Scene III. A church-yard with the ruins of a spacious gothic cathedral. On the cloister walls the Dance of Death is painted. On one side the sepulchre of the Dukes with massy carved folding doors. Moonlight. Enter Isbrand and Siegfried. Isbr. Not here? That wolf-howled, witch-prayed, owl-sung fool, Fat mother moon hath brought the cats their light A whole thief's hour, and yet they are not met. I thought the bread and milky thick-spread lies, With which I plied them, would have drawn to head The state's bad humours quickly. Siegfr. They delay Until the twilight strollers are gone home. Isbr. That may be. This is a sweet place methinks: These arches and their caves, now double-nighted With heaven's and that creeping darkness, ivy, Delight me strangely. Ruined churches oft, As this, are crime's chief haunt, as ruined angels Straight become fiends. This tomb too tickleth me With its wild-rose branches. Dost remember, Siegfried, About the buried Duchess? In this cradle I placed the new dead: here the changeling lies. Siegfr. Are we so near? A frightful theft! Isbr. Fright! idiot! Peace; there's a footstep on the pavement. Enter the Duke. Welcome! I thank you, wanderer, for coming first. They of the town lag still. Duke. The enterprise, And you its head, much please me. Isbr. You are courteous. Duke. Better: I'm honest. But your ways and words Are so familiar to my memory, That I could almost think we had been friends Since our now riper and declining lives Undid their outer leaves. Isbr. I can remember No earlier meeting. What need of it? Methinks We agree well enough: especially As you have brought bad tidings of the Duke. Duke. If I had time, And less disturbed thoughts, I'd search my memory For what thou'rt like. Now we have other matters To talk about. Isbr. And, thank the stingy star-shine, I see the shades of others of our council. Enter Adalmar and other conspirators. Though late met, well met, friends. Where stay the rest? For we're still few here. Adalm. They are contented With all the steps proposed, and keep their chambers Aloof from the suspecting crowd of eyes, Which day doth feed with sights for nightly gossip, Till your hour strikes. Isbr. That's well to keep at home, And hide, as doth Heaven's wrath, till the last minute. Little's to say. We fall as gently on them, As the first drops of Noah's world-washing shower Upon the birds' wings and the leaves. Give each A copy of this paper: it contains A quick receipt to make a new creation In our old dukedom. Here stands he who framed it. Adalm. The unknown pilgrim! You have warrant, Isbrand, For trusting him? Isbr. I have. Adalm. Enough. How are the citizens? You feasted them these three days. Isbr. And have them by the heart for't. 'Neath Grüssau's tiles sleep none, whose deepest bosom My fathom hath not measured; none, whose thoughts I have not made a map of. In the depth And labyrinthine home of the still soul, Where the seen thing is imaged, and the whisper Joints the expecting spirit, my spies, which are Suspicion's creeping words, have stolen in, And, with their eyed feelers, touched and sounded The little hiding holes of cunning thought, And each dark crack in which a reptile purpose Hangs in its chrysalis unripe for birth. All of each heart I know. Duke. O perilous boast! Fathom the wavy caverns of all stars, Know every side of every sand in earth, And hold in little all the lore of man, As a dew's drop doth miniature the sun: But never hope to learn the alphabet, In which the hieroglyphic human soul More changeably is painted, than the rainbow Upon the cloudy pages of a shower, Whose thunderous hinges a wild wind doth turn. Know all of each! when each doth shift his thought More often in a minute, than the air Dust on a summer path. Isbr. Liquors can lay them: Grape-juice or vein-juice. Duke. Yet there may be one, Whose misty mind's perspective still lies hid. Isbr. Ha! stranger, where? Duke. A quiet, listening, flesh-concealed soul. Isbr. Are the ghosts eaves-dropping? None, that do live, Listen besides ourselves. (A struggle behind: Siegfried drags Mario forward.) Who's there? Siegfr. A fellow, Who crouched behind the bush, dipping his ears Into the stream of your discourse. Isbr. Come forward. Mario. Then lead me. Were it noon, I could not find him Whose voice commands me: in these callous hands There is as much perception for the light, As in the depth of my poor dayless eyes. Isbr. Thy hand then. Mario. Art thou leader here? Isbr. Perchance. Mario. Then listen, as I listened unto you, And let my life and story end together, If it seem good to you. A Roman am I; A Roman in unroman times: I've slept At midnight in our Capitolian ruins, And breathed the ghost of our great ancient world, Which there doth walk: and among glorious visions, That the unquiet tombs sent forth to me, Learned I the love of freedom. Scipio saw I Washing the stains of Carthage from his sword, And his freed poet, playing on his lyre A melody men's souls did sing unto: Oak-bound and laurelled heads, each man a country; And in the midst, like a sun o'er the sea, (Each helm in the crowd gilt by a ray from him,) Bald Julius sitting lonely in his car, Within the circle of whose laurel wreath All spirits of the earth and sea were spell-bound. Down with him to the grave! Down with the god! Stab, Cassius; Brutus, through him; through him, all! Dead.—As he fell there was a tearing sigh: Earth stood on him; her roots were in his heart; They fell together. Cæsar and his world Lie in the Capitol; and Jove lies there, With all the gods of Rome and of Olympus; Corpses: and does the eagle batten on them? No; she is flown: the owl sits in her nest; The toge is cut for cowls; and falsehood dozes In the chair of freedom, triple-crowned beast, King Cerberus. Thence I have come in time To see one grave for foul oppression dug, Though I may share it. Isbr. Nay: thou'rt a bold heart. Welcome among us. Mario. I was guided hither By one in white, garlanded like a bride, Divinely beautiful, leading me softly; And she doth place my hand in thine, once more Bidding me guard her honour amongst men; And so I will, with death to him that soils it: For she is Liberty. Adalm. In her name we take thee; And for her sake welcome thee brotherly. At the right time thou comest to us, dark man, Like an eventful unexpected night, Which finishes a row of plotting days, Fulfilling their designs. Isbr. Now then, my fellows, No more; but to our unsuspected homes. Good night to all who rest; hope to the watchful. Stranger, with me. [To Mario. [Exeunt: manet Duke. Duke. I'm old and desolate. O were I dead With thee, my wife! Oft have I lain by night Upon thy grave, and burned with the mad wish To raise thee up to life. Thank God, whom then I might have thought not pitiful, for lending No ear to such a prayer. Far better were I Thy grave-fellow, than thou alive with me, Amid the fears and perils of the time. Enter Ziba. Who's in the dark there? Ziba. One of the dark's colour: Ziba, thy slave. Duke. Come at a wish, my Arab. Is Thorwald's house asleep yet? Ziba. No: his lights still burn. Duke. Go; fetch a lantern and some working fellows With spade and pickaxe. Let not Thorwald come. In good speed do it. [Exit Ziba. That alone is left me: I will abandon this ungrateful country, And leave my dukedom's earth behind me; all, Save the small urn that holds my dead beloved: That relic will I save from my wrecked princedom; Beside it live and die. (Enter Thorwald, Ziba, and gravediggers.) Thorwald with them! Old friend, I hoped you were in pleasant sleep: 'Tis a late walking hour. Thorw. I came to learn Whether the slave spoke true. This haunted hour, What would you with the earth? Dig you for treasure? Duke. Ay, I do dig for treasure. To the vault, Lift up the kneeling marble woman there, And delve down to the coffin. Ay, for treasure: The very dross of such a soul and body Shall stay no longer in this land of hate. I'll covetously rake the ashes up Of this my love-consumed incense star, And in a golden urn, over whose sides An unborn life of sculpture shall be poured, They shall stand ever on my chamber altar. I am not Heaven's rebel; think't not of me; Nor that I'd trouble her sepulchral sleep For a light end. Religiously I come To change the bed of my beloved lady, That what remains below of us may join, Like its immortal. Thorw. There is no ill here: And yet this breaking through the walls, that sever The quick and cold, led never yet to good. Ziba. Our work is done: betwixt the charmed moonshine And the coffin lies nought but a nettle's shade, That shakes its head at the deed. Duke. Let the men go. [Exeunt labourers. Now Death, thou shadowy miser, I am thy robber; be not merciful, But take me in requital. There is she then; I cannot hold my tears, thinking how altered. O thoughts, ye fleeting, unsubstantial family! Thou formless, viewless, and unuttered memory! How dare ye yet survive that gracious image, Sculptured about the essence whence ye rose? That words of her should ever dwell in me, Who is as if she never had been born To all earth's millions, save this one! Nay, prithee, Let no one comfort me. I'll mourn awhile Over her memory. Thorw. Let the past be past, And Lethe freeze unwept on over it. What is, be patient with: and, with what shall be, Silence the body-bursting spirit's yearnings. Thou say'st that, when she died, that day was spilt All beauty flesh could hold; that day went down An oversouled creation. The time comes When thou shalt find again thy blessed love, Pure from all earth, and with the usury Of her heaven-hoarded charms. Duke. Is this the silence That I commanded? Fool, thou say'st a lesson Out of some philosophic pedant's book. I loved no desolate soul: she was a woman, Whose spirit I knew only through those limbs, Those tender members thou dost dare despise; By whose exhaustless beauty, infinite love, Trackless expression only, I did learn That there was aught yet viewless and eternal; Since they could come from such alone. Where is she? Where shall I ever see her as she was? With the sweet smile, she smiled only on me; With those eyes full of thoughts, none else could see? Where shall I meet that brow and lip with mine? Hence with thy shadows! But her warm fair body, Where's that? There, mouldered to the dust. Old man, If thou dost dare to mock my ears again With thy ridiculous, ghostly consolation, I'll send thee to the blessings thou dost speak of. Thorw. For heaven's and her sake restrain this passion. Duke. She died. But Death is old and half worn out: Are there no chinks in't? Could she not come to me? Ghosts have been seen; but never in a dream, After she'd sighed her last, was she the blessing Of these desiring eyes. All, save my soul, And that but for her sake, were his who knew The spell of Endor, and could raise her up. Thorw. Another time that thought were impious. Unreasonable longings, such as these, Fit not your age and reason. In sorrow's rage Thou dost demand and bargain for a dream, Which children smile at in their tales. Ziba. Smile ignorance! But, sure as men have died strong necromancy Hath set the clock of time and nature back; And made Earth's rooty, ruinous, grave-floored caverns Throb with the pangs of birth. Ay, were I ever Where the accused innocent did pray Acquittal from dead lips, I would essay My sires' sepulchral magic. Duke. Slave, thou tempt'st me To lay my sword's point to thy throat, and say “Do it or die thyself.” Thorw. Prithee, come in. To cherish hopes like these is either madness, Or a sure cause of it. Come in and sleep: To morrow we'll talk further. Duke. Go in thou. Sleep blinds no eyes of mine, till I have proved This slave's temptation. Thorw. Then I leave you to him. Good night again. [Exit Thorwald. Duke. Good night, and quiet slumbers. Now then, thou juggling African, thou shadow, Think'st thou I will not murder thee this night, If thou again dare tantalize my soul With thy accursed hints, thy lying boasts? Say, shall I stab thee? Ziba. Then thou murder'st truth. I spoke of what I'd do. Duke. You told ghost-lies, And held me for a fool because I wept. Now, once more, silence: or to-night I shed Drops royaller and redder than those tears. Enter Isbrand and Siegfried. Isbr. Pilgrim, not yet abed? Why, ere you've time To lay your cloak down, heaven will strip off night, And show her daily bosom. Duke. Sir, my eyes Never did feel less appetite for sleep: I and my slave intend to watch till morrow. Isbr. Excellent. You're a fellow of my humour. I never sleep o' nights: the black sky likes me, And the soul's solitude, while half mankind Lie quiet in earth's shade and rehearse death. Come, let's be merry: I have sent for wine, And here it comes. [It is brought in. These mossy stones about us Will serve for stools, although they have been turrets, Which scarce aught touched but sunlight, or the claw Of the strong-winged eagles, who lived here And fed on battle-bones. Come sit, sir stranger; Sit too, my devil-coloured one; here's room Upon my rock. Fill, Siegfried Siegfr. Yellow wine, And rich be sure. How like you it? Duke. Better ne'er wetted lip. Isbr. Then fill again. Come, hast no song to-night, Siegfried? Nor you, my midnight of a man? I'm weary of dumb toping. Siegfr. Yet you sing not. My songs are staler than the cuckoo's tune: And you, companions? Duke. We are quite unused. Isbr. Then you shall have a ballad of my making. Siegfr. How? do you rhyme too? Isbr. Sometimes, in rainy weather. Here's what I made one night, while picking poisons To make the rats a sallad. Duke. And what's your tune? Isbr. What is the night-bird's tune, wherewith she startles The bee out of his dream, that turns and kisses The inmost of his flower and sleeps again? What is the lobster's tune when he is boiling? I hate your ballads that are made to come Round like a squirrel's cage, and round again. We nightingales sing boldly from our hearts: So listen to us. Song by Isbrand. Squats on a toad-stool under a tree A bodiless childfull of life in the gloom, Crying with frog voice, “What shall I be? Poor unborn ghost, for my mother killed me Scarcely alive in her wicked womb. What shall I be? shall I creep to the egg That's cracking asunder yonder by Nile, And with eighteen toes, And a snuff-taking nose, Make an Egyptian crocodile? Sing, ‘Catch a mummy by the leg And crunch him with an upper jaw, Wagging tail and clenching claw; Take a bill-full from my craw, Neighbour raven, caw, O caw, Grunt, my crocky, pretty maw!’ “Swine, shall I be you? Thou'rt a dear dog; But for a smile, and kiss, and pout, I much prefer your black-lipped snout, Little, gruntless, fairy hog, Godson of the hawthorn hedge. For, when Ringwood snuffs me out, And 'gins my tender paunch to grapple, Sing, ‘Twixt your ancles visage wedge, And roll up like an apple.’ “Serpent Lucifer, how do you do? Of your worms and your snakes I'd be one or two; For in this dear planet of wool and of leather 'Tis pleasant to need neither shirt, sleeve, nor shoe, And have arm, leg, and belly together. Then aches your head, or are you lazy? Sing, ‘Round your neck your belly wrap, Tail-a-top, and make your cap Any bee and daisy.’ “I'll not be a fool, like the nightingale Who sits up all midnight without any ale, Making a noise with his nose; Nor a camel, although 'tis a beautiful back; Nor a duck, notwithstanding the music of quack, And the webby, mud-patting toes. I'll be a new bird with the head of an ass, Two pigs' feet, two mens' feet, and two of a hen; Devil-winged; dragon-bellied; grave-jawed, because grass Is a beard that's soon shaved, and grows seldom again Before it is summer; so cow all the rest; The new Dodo is finished. O! come to my nest.” Siegfr. A noble hymn to the belly gods indeed: Would that Pythagoras heard thee, boy! Isbr. I fear you flatter: 'tis perhaps a little Too sweet and tender, but that is the fashion; Besides my failing is too much sentiment. Fill the cups up, and pass them round again; I'm not my nightly self yet. There's creation In these thick yellow drops. By my faith, Siegfried, A man of meat and water's a thin beast, But he who sails upon such waves as these Begins to be a fellow. The old gods Were only men and wine. Siegfr. Here's to their memory. They're dead, poor sinners, all of them but Death, Who has laughed down Jove's broad, ambrosian brow, Furrowed with earth-quake frowns: and not a ghost Haunts the gods' town upon Olympus' peak. Isbr. Methinks that earth and heaven are grown bad neighbours, And have blocked up the common door between them. Five hundred years ago had we sat here So late and lonely, many a jolly ghost Would have joined company. Siegfr. To trust in story, In the old times Death was a feverish sleep, In which men walked. The other world was cold And thinly-peopled, so life's emigrants Came back to mingle with the crowds of earth: But now great cities are transplanted thither, Memphis, and Babylon, and either Thebes, And Priam's towery town with its one beech. The dead are most and merriest: so be sure There will be no more haunting, till their towns Are full to the garret; then they'll shut their gates, To keep the living out, and perhaps leave A dead or two between both kingdoms. Duke. Ziba; Hear'st thou, phantastic mountebank, what's said? Ziba. Nay: as I live and shall be one myself, I can command them hither. Isbr. Whom? Ziba. Departed spirits. Duke. He who dares think that words of human speech, A chalky ring with monstrous figures in it, Or smoky flames can draw the distant souls Of those, whose bones and monuments are dust, Must shudder at the restless, broken death, Which he himself in age shall fall into. Isbr. Suppose we four had lived in Cyrus' time, And had our graves under Egyptian grass, D'you think, at whistling of a necromant, I'd leave my wine or subterranean love To know his bidding? Mummies cannot pull The breathing to them, when they'd learn the news. Ziba. Perhaps they do, in sleep, in swoons, in fevers: But your belief's not needed. [To the Duke]. You remember The damsel dark at Mecca, whom we saw Weeping the death of a pale summer flower, Which her spear-slain beloved had tossed to her Galloping into battle? Duke. Happy one! Whose eyes could yield a tear to soothe her sorrows. But what's that to the point? Ziba. As those tears fell, A magic scholar passed; and, their cause known, Bade her no longer mourn: he called a bird, And bade it with its bill select a grain Out of the gloomy death-bed of the blossom. The feathery bee obeyed; and scraped aside The sand, and dropped the seed into its grave: And there the old plant lay, still and forgotten, By its just budding grandsons; but not long: For soon the floral necromant brought forth A wheel of amber, (such may Clotho use When she spins lives,) and, as he turned and sung, The mould was cracked and shouldered up; there came A curved stalk, and then two leaves unfurled, And slow and straight between them there arose, Ghostily still, again the crowned flower. Is it not easier to raise a man, Whose soul strives upward ever, than a plant, Whose very life stands halfway on death's road, Asleep and buried half? Duke. This was a cheat: The herb was born anew out of a seed, Not raised out of a bony skeleton. What tree is man the seed of? Ziba. Of a ghost; Of his night-coming, tempest-waved phantom: And even as there is a round dry grain In a plant's skeleton, which being buried Can raise the herb's green body up again; So is there such in man, a seed-shaped bone, Aldabaron, called by the Hebrews Luz, Which, being laid into the ground, will bear After three thousand years the grass of flesh, The bloody, soul-possessed weed called man. Isbr. Let's have a trick then in all haste, I prithee. The world's man-crammed; we want no more of them: But show me, if you will, some four-legged ghost; Rome's mother, the she-wolf; or the fat goat From whose dugs Jove sucked godhead; any thing; Pig, bullock, goose; for they have goblins too, Else ours would have no dinner. Ziba. Were you worthy, I'd raise a spirit whom your conscience knows; And he would drag thee down into that world, Whither thou didst send him. Isbr. Thanks for the offer. Our wine's out, and these clouds, whose blackest wombs Seem swelling with a second centaur-birth, Threaten plain water. So good night. [Exit with Siegfried. Duke. Obstinate slave! Now that we are alone, Durst thou again say life and soul has lifted The dead man from the grave, and sent him walking Over the earth? Ziba. I say it, and will add Deed to my word, not oath. Within what tomb Dwells he, whom you would call? Duke. There. But stand off! If you do juggle with her holy bones, By God I'll murder thee. I don't believe you, For here next to my heart I wear a bond, Written in the blood of one who was my friend, In which he swears that, dying first, he would Borrow some night his body from the ground, To visit me once more. One day we quarrelled, Swords hung beside us and we drew: he fell. Yet never has his bond or his revenge Raised him to my bed-side, haunting his murderer, Or keeping blood-sealed promise to his friend. Does not this prove you lie? Ziba. 'Tis not my spell: Shall I try that with him? Duke. No, no! not him. The heavy world press on him, where he lies, With all her towers and mountains! Ziba. Listen, lord. Time was when Death was young and pitiful, Though callous now by use: and then there dwelt, In the thin world above, a beauteous Arab, Unmated yet and boyish. To his couch At night, which shone so starry through the boughs, A pale flower-breathed nymph with dewy hair Would often come, but all her love was silent; And ne'er by day-light could he gaze upon her, For ray by ray, as morning came, she paled, And like a snow of air dissolv'd i' th' light, Leaving behind a stalk with lilies hung, Round which her womanish graces had assembled. So did the early love-time of his youth Pass with delight: but when, compelled at length, He left the wilds and woods for riotous camps And cities full of men, he saw no more, Tho' prayed and wept for, his old bed-time vision, The pale dissolving maiden. He would wander Sleepless about the waste, benighted fields, Asking the speechless shadows of his thoughts “Who shared my couch? Who was my love? Where is she?” Thus passing through a grassy burial-ground, Wherein a new-dug grave gaped wide for food, “Who was she?” cried he, and the earthy mouth Did move its nettle-bearded lips together, And said “'Twas I—I, Death: behold our child!” The wanderer looked, and on the lap of the pit A young child slept as at a mother's breast. He raised it and he reared it. From that infant My race, the death-begotten, draw their blood: Our prayer for the diseased works more than medicine; Our blessings oft secure grey hairs and happy To new-born infants; and, in case of need, The dead and gone are re-begotten by us, And motherlessly born to second life. Duke. I've heard your tale. Now exorcise: but, mark! If thou dost dare to make my heart thy fool, I'll send thee to thy grave-mouthed grandam, Arab. Ziba. Wilt thou submit unmurmuring to all evils, Which this recall to a forgotten being May cause to thee and thine? Duke. With all my soul, So I may take the good. Ziba. And art thou ready To follow, if so be its will, the ghost, Whom you will re-imbody, to the place Which it doth now inhabit? Duke. My first wish. Now to your sorcery: and no more conditions, In hopes I may break off. All ill be mine, Which shall the world revisit with the being That lies within. Ziba. Enough. Upon this scroll Are written words, which read, even in a whisper, Would in the air create another star; And, more than thunder-tongued storms in the sky, Make the old world to quake and sweat with fear; And, as the chilly damps of her death-swoon Fall and condense, they to the moon reflect The forms and colours of the pale old dead. Laid there among the bones, and left to burn, With sacred spices, its keen vaporous power Would draw to life the earliest dead of all, Swift as the sun doth ravish a dew-drop Out of a flower. But see, the torch-flame dies: How shall I light it? Duke. Here's my useless blood-bond; These words, that should have waked illumination Within a corpse's eyes, will make a tinder, Whose sparks might be of life instead of fire. Burn it. Ziba. An incense for thy senses, god of those, To whom life is as death to us; who were, Ere our grey ancestors wrote history; When these our ruined towers were in the rock; And our great forests, which do feed the sea With storm-souled fleets, lay in an acorn's cup: When all was seed that now is dust; our minute Invisibly far future. Send thy spirit From plant of the air, and from the air and earth, And from earth's worms, and roots, again to gather The dispersed being, 'mid whose bones I place The words which, spoken, shall destroy death's kingdom, And which no voice, but thunder, can pronounce. Marrow fill bone, and vine-like veins run round them, And flesh, thou grass, mown wert thou long ago,— Now comes the brown dry after-crop. Ho! ghost! There's thy old heart a-beating, and thy life Burning on the old hearth. Come home again! Duke. Hush! Do you hear a noise? Ziba. It is the sound Of the ghost's foot on Jacob's ladder-rungs. Duke. More like the tread upon damp stony steps Out of a dungeon. Dost thou hear a door Drop its great bolt and grate upon its hinges? Ziba. Serpentine Hell! That is thy staircase echo, [aside. And thy jaws' groaning. What betides it? Duke. Thou human murder-time of night, What hast thou done? Ziba. My task: give me to death, if the air has not What was the earth's but now. Ho there! i' th' vault. A Voice. Who breaks my death? Ziba. Draw on thy body, take up thy old limbs, And then come forth tomb-born. Duke. One moment's peace! Let me remember what a grace she had, Even in her dying hour: her soul set not, But at its noon Death like a cloud came o'er it, And now hath passed away. O come to me, Thou dear returned spirit of my wife; And, surely as I clasp thee once again, Thou shalt not die without me. Ziba. Ho! there, Grave, Is life within thee? The Voice. Melveric, I am here. Duke. Did'st hear that whisper? Open, and let in The blessing to my eyes, whose subtle breath Doth penetrate my heart's quick; and let me hear That dearest name out of those dearest lips. Who comes back to my heart? (Mandrake runs out of the sepulchre.) Ziba. Momus of Hell, what's this? Duke. Is this thy wretched jest, thou villanous fool? But I will punish thee, by heaven; and thou too [To Mandrake. Shalt soon be what thou shouldst have better acted. Mandr. Excuse me: as you have thought proper to call me to the living, I shall take the liberty of remaining alive. If you want to speak to another ghost, of longer standing, look into the old lumber-room of a vault again: some one seems to be putting himself together there. Good night, gentlemen, for I must travel to Egypt once more. [Exit. Duke. Thou disappointed cheat! Was this a fellow, Whom thou hadst hired to act a spectral part? Thou see'st how well he does it. But away! Or I will teach thee better to rehearse it. Ziba. Death is a hypocrite then, a white dissembler, Like all that doth seem good! I am put to shame. [Exit. Duke. Deceived and disappointed vain desires! Why laugh I not, and ridicule myself? 'Tis still, and cold, and nothing in the air But an old grey twilight, or of eve or morn, I know not which, dim as futurity, And sad and hoary as the ghostly past, Fills up the space. Hush! not a wind is there, Not a cloud sails over the battlements, Not a bell tolls the hour. Is there an hour? Or is not all gone by, which here did hive, Of men and their life's ways? Could I but hear The ticking of a clock, or some one breathing, Or e'en a cricket's chirping, or the grating Of the old gates amidst the marble tombs, I should be sure that this was still the world. Hark! Hark! Doth nothing stir? No light, and still no light, besides this ghost That mocks the dawn, unaltered? Still no sound? No voice of man? No cry of beast? No rustle Of any moving creature? And sure I feel That I remain the same: no more round blood-drops Roll joyously along my pulseless veins: The air I seem to breathe is still the same: And the great dreadful thought, that now comes o'er me, Must remain ever as it is, unchanged.— This moment doth endure for evermore; Eternity hath overshadowed time; And I alone am left of all that lived, Pent in this narrow, horrible conviction. Ha! the dead soon will wake! My Agnes, rise; Rise up, my wife! One look, ere Wolfram comes; Quick, or it is too late: the murdered hasten: My best-beloved, come once to my heart . . But ah! who art thou? (The gates of the sepulchre fly open and discover Wolfram.) Wolfr. Wolfram, murderer, To whose heart thou didst come with horrid purpose. Duke. Lie of my eyes, begone! Art thou not dead? Are not the worms, that ate thy marrow, dead? What dost thou here, thou wretched goblin fool? Think'st thou, I fear thee? Thou man-mocking air, Thou art not truer than a mirror's image, Nor half so lasting. Back again to coffin, Thou baffled idiot spectre, or haunt cradles: Or stay, and I'll laugh at thee. Guard thyself, If thou pretendest life. Wolfr. Is this thin air, that thrusts thy sword away? Flesh, bones, and soul, and blood that thou stol'st from me, Upon thy summons, bound by heart-red letters, Here Wolfram stands: what wouldst thou? Duke. What sorcery else, But that cursed compact, could have made full Hell Boil over, and spill thee, thou topmost damned? But down again! I'll see no more of thee. Hound to thy kennel, to your coffin bones, Ghost to thy torture! Wolfr. Thou returnest with me; So make no hurry. I will stay awhile To see how the old world goes, feast and be merry, And then to work again. Duke. Darest thou stand there, Thou shameless vapour, and assert thyself, While I defy, and question, and deride thee? The stars, I see them dying: clearly all The passage of this night remembrance gives me, And I think coolly: but my brain is mad, Else why behold I that? Is't possible Thou'rt true, and worms have vomited thee up Upon this rind of earth? No; thou shalt vanish. Was it for this I hated thee and killed thee? I'll have thee dead again, and hounds and eagles Shall be thy graves, since this old, earthy one Hath spat thee out for poison. Wolfr. Thou, old man, Art helpless against me. I shall not harm thee; So lead me home. I am not used to sunlight, And morn's a-breaking. Duke. Then there is rebellion Against all kings, even Death. Murder's worn out And full of holes; I'll never make't the prison, Of what I hate, again. Come with me, spectre; If thou wilt live against the body's laws, Thou murderer of Nature, it shall be A question, which haunts which, while thou dost last. So come with me. [Exeunt. ACT IV. Scene I. An apartment in the Governor's palace. The Duke and an attendant. Duke. Your lord sleeps yet? Attend. An hour ago he rose: About this time he's busy with his falcons, And then he takes his meal. Duke. I'll wait for him. [Exit Attendant. How strange it is that I can live to day; Nay look like other men, who have been sleeping On quiet pillows and not dreamt! Methinks The look of the world's a lie, a face made up O'er graves and fiery depths; and nothing's true But what is horrible. If man could see The perils and diseases that he elbows, Each day he walks a mile; which catch at him, Which fall behind and graze him as he passes; Then would he know that Life's a single pilgrim, Fighting unarmed amongst a thousand soldiers. It is this infinite invisible Which we must learn to know, and yet to scorn, And, from the scorn of that, regard the world As from the edge of a far star. Now then I feel me in the thickest of the battle; The arrow-shower pours down, swords hew, mines open Their ravenous mouths about me; it rains death; But cheerly I defy the braggart storm, And set my back against a rock, to fight Till I am bloodily won. Enter Thorwald. Thorw. How? here already? I'm glad on't, and to see you look so clear After that idle talk. How did it end? Duke. Scarcely as I expected. Thorw. Dared he conjure? But surely you have seen no ghost last night: You seem to have supped well and slept. Duke. We'd wine, And some wild singing. Of the necromancy We'll speak no more. Ha! Do you see a shadow? Thorw. Ay: and the man who casts it. Duke. Tis true; my eyes are dim and dull with watching. This castle that fell down, and was rebuilt With the same stones, is the same castle still; And so with him. Enter Wolfram. Thorw. What mean you? Duke. Impudent goblin! Darest thou the day-light? Dar'st be seen of more Than me, the guilty? Vanish! Though thou'rt there, I'll not believe I see thee. Or is this The work of necromantic Conscience? Ha! 'Tis nothing but a picture: curtain it. Strange visions, my good Thorwald, are begotten, When Sleep o'ershadows waking. Thorw. Who's the stranger? You speak as one familiar. Duke. Is aught here Besides our-selves? I think not. Thorw. Yet you gaze Straight on the man. Duke. A villanous friend of mine; Of whom I must speak well, and still permit him To follow me. So thou'rt yet visible, Thou grave-breaker! If thou wilt haunt me thus, I'll make thee my fool, ghost, my jest and zany. 'Tis his officious gratitude that pains me: The carcase owes to me its ruinous life, (Between whose broken walls and hideous arches You see the other world's grey spectral light;) Therefore he clings to me so ivily. Now, goblin, lie about it. 'Tis in truth A faithful slave. Wolfr. If I had come unsummoned, If I had burst into your sunny world, And stolen visibility and birth Against thy prayers, thus shouldst thou speak to me: But thou hast forced me up, remember that. I am no fiend, no foe; then let me hear These stern and tyrannous rebukes no more. Wilt thou be with the born, that have not died? I vanish: now a short farewell. I fade; The air doth melt me, and, my form being gone, I'm all thou see'st not. [He disappears. Duke. Dissolved like snow in water! Be my cloud, My breath, and fellow soul, I can bear all, As long as thou art viewless to these others. Now there are two of us. How stands the bridal? Thorw. This evening 'twill be held. Duke. Good; and our plot Leaps on your pleasure's lap; here comes my gang; Away with you. [Exit Thorwald. I do begin to feel As if I were a ghost among the men, As all, whom I loved, are; for their affections Hang on things new, young, and unknown to me: And that I am is but the obstinate will Of this my hostile body. Enter Isbrand, Adalmar, and Siegfried. Isbr. Come, let's be doing: we have talked whole nights Of what an instant, with one flash of action, Should have performed: you wise and speaking people Need some one, with a hatchet-stroke, to free The Pallas of your Jove-like headaches. Duke. Patience: Fledging comes after hatching. One day more: This evening brings the wedding of the prince, And with it feasts and maskings. In mid bowls And giddy dances let us fall upon them. Siegfr. Well thought: our enemies will be assembled. Isbr. I like to see Ruin at dinner time, Firing his cannons with the match they lit For the buck-roasting faggots. But what say you To what concerns you most? [to Adalmar. Adalm. That I am ready To hang my hopeful crown of happiness Upon the temple of the public good. Isbr. Of that no need. Your wedding shall be finished; Or left, like a full goblet yet untasted, To be drunk up with greater thirst from toil. I'll wed too when I've time. My honest pilgrim, The melancholy lady, you brought with you, Looks on me with an eye of much content: I have sent some rhymed love-letters unto her, In my best style. D' you think we're well matched? Adalm. How? Would you prop the peach upon the upas? Isbr. True: I am rough, a surly bellowing storm; But fallen, never tear did hang more tender Upon the eye-lash of a love-lorn girl, Or any Frenchman's long, frost-bitten nose, Than in the rosecup of that lady's life I shall lie trembling. Pilgrim, plead for me With a tongue love-oiled. Duke. Win her, sir, and wear her. But you and she are scarcely for one world. Isbr. Enough; I'll wed her. Siegfried, come with me; We'll talk about it in the rainy weather. Pilgrim, anon I find you in the ruins, Where we had wine last night. [Exit with Siegfried. Adalm. Would that it all were over, and well over! Suspicions flash upon me here and there: But we're in the mid ocean without compass, Winds wild, and billows rolling us away: Onwards with hope! Duke. Of what? Youth, is it possible That thou art toiling here for liberty, And others' welfare, and such virtuous shadows As philosophic fools and beggars raise Out of the world that's gone? Thou'lt sell thy birth-right For incense praise, less tickling to the sense Than Esau's pottage steam? Adalm. No, not for these, Fame's breath and praise, its shadow. 'Tis my humour To do what's right and good. Duke. Thou'rt a strange prince. Why all the world, except some fifty lean ones, Would, in your place and at your ardent years, Seek the delight that lies in woman's limbs And mountain-covering grapes. What's to be royal, Unless you pick those girls, whose cheeks you fancy, As one would cowslips? And soo hills and valleys Mantled in autumn with the snaky plant, Whose juice is the right madness, the best godship? Have men, and beasts, and woods, with flower and fruit From all the earth, one's slaves; bid the worm eat Your next year's purple from the mulberry leaf, The tiger shed his skin to line your car, And men die, thousands in a day, for glory? Such things should kings bid from their solitude Upon the top of Man. Justice and Good, All penniless, base, earthy kind of fellows, So low, one wonders they were not born dogs, Can do as well, alas! Adalm. There's cunning in thee. A year ago this doctrine might have pleased me: But since, I have remembered, in my childhood My teachers told me that I was immortal, And had within me something like a god; Now, by believing firmly in that promise, I do enjoy a part of its fulfilment, And, antedating my eternity, Act as I were immortal. Duke. Think of now. This Hope and Memory are wild horses, tearing The precious now to pieces. Grasp and use The breath within you; for you know not, whether That wind about the trees brings you one more. Thus far yourself. But tell me, hath no other A right, which you would injure? Is this sceptre, Which you would stamp to dust and let each varlet Pick out his grain of power; this great spirit, This store of mighty men's concentrate souls, Which kept your fathers in god's breath, and you Would waste in the wide, smoky, pestilent air For every dog to snuff in; is this royalty Your own? O! when you were a boy, young prince, I would have laid my heart upon your spirit: Now both are broken. Adalm. Father? Duke. Yes, my son: We'll live to be most proud of those two names. Go on thy way: I follow and o'erlook. This pilgrim's shape will hang about and guard thee, Being but the shadow of my sunniness, Looking in patience through a cloudy time. [Exeunt. Scene II. A garden. Sibylla and Athulf. Athulf. From me no comfort. O you specious creatures, So poisonous to the eye! Go! you sow madness: And one of you, although I cannot curse her, Will make my grave a murderer's. I'll do nought; But rather drink and revel at your bridal. And why not Isbrand? Many such a serpent Doth lick heaven's dew out of as sweet a flower. Wed, wed! I'll not prevent it. Sibyl. I beseech thee, If there be any tie of love between thee And her who is thy brother's. Athulf. Curse the word! And trebly curse the deed that made us brothers! O that I had been born the man I hate! Any, at least, but one. Then—sleep my soul; And walk not in thy sleep to do the act, Which thou must ever dream of. My fair lady, I would not be the reason of one tear Upon thy bosom, if the times were other; If women were not women. When the world Turns round the other way, and doing Cain-like Passes as merrily as doing Eve-like, Then I'll be pitiful. Let go my hand; It is a mischievous limb, and may run wild, Doing the thing its master would not. [Exit. Sibyl. Then no one hears me. O! the world's too loud, With trade and battle, for my feeble cry To rouse the living. The invisible Hears best what is unspoken; and my thoughts Have long been calling comfort from the grave. (Wolfram suddenly appears, in the garment of a monk.) Wolfr. Lady, you called me. Sibyl. I? Wolfr. The word was Comfort: A name by which the master, whose I am, Is named by many wise and many wretched. Will you with me to the place where sighs are not; A shore of blessing, which disease doth beat Sea-like, and dashes those whom he would wreck Into the arms of Peace? But ah! what say I? You're young and must be merry in the world; Have friends to envy, lovers to betray you; And feed young children with the blood of your heart, Till they have sucked up strength enough to break it. Poor woman! Art thou nothing but the straw Bearing a heavy poison, and, that shed, Cut down to be stamped on? But thou'rt i' th' blade; The green and milky sun-deceived grass: So stand till the scythe comes, take shine and shower, And the wind fell you gently. Sibyl. Do not go. Speak as at first you did; there was in the words A mystery and music, which did thaw The hard old rocky world into a flood, Whereon a swan-drawn boat seemed at my feet Rocking on its blue billows; and I heard Harmonies, and breathed odours from an isle, Whose flowers cast tremulous shadows in the day Of an immortal sun, and crowd the banks Whereon immortal human kind doth couch. This I have dreamt before: your speech recalled it. So speak to soothe me once again. Wolfr. (aside) Snake Death, Sweet as the cowslip's honey is thy whisper: O let this dove escape thee! I'll not plead, I will not be thy suitor to this innocent: Open thy craggy jaws; speak, coffin-tongued, Persuasions through the dancing of the yew-bough And the crow's nest upon it. (aloud) Lady fair, Listen not to me, look not on me more. I have a fascination in my words, A magnet in my look, which drags you downwards, From hope and life. You set your eyes upon me, And think I stand upon this earth beside you: Alas! I am upon a jutting stone, Which crumbles down the steeps of an abyss; And you, above me far, grow wild and giddy: Leave me, or you must fall into the deep. Sibyl. I leave thee never, nor thou me. O no! You know not what a heart you spurn away; How good it might be, if love cherished it; And how deserted 'tis; ah! so deserted, That I have often wished a ghost would come, Whose love might haunt it. Turn not thou, the last. Thou see'st I'm young: how happy might I be! And yet I only wish these tears I shed Were raining on my grave. If thou'lt not love me, Then do me the next office; show me only The shortest path to solitary death. Wolfr. You're moved to wildness, maiden. Beg not of me. I can grant nothing good: quiet thyself, And seek heaven's help. Farewell. Sibyl. Wilt thou leave me? Unpitying, aye unmoved in cheek and heart, Stern, selfish mortal? Hast thou heard my prayer; Hast seen me weep; hast seen my limbs to quiver, Like a storm-shaken tree over its roots? Art thou alive, and canst thou see this wretch, Without a care? Wolfr. Thou see'st I am unmoved: Infer the truth. Sibyl. Thy soul indeed is dead. Wolfr. My soul, my soul! O that it wore not now The semblance of a garb it hath cast off; O that it was disrobed of these mock limbs, Shed by a rocky birth unnaturally, Long after their decease and burial! O woe that I must speak! for she, who hears, Is marked for no more breathing. There are histories Of women, nature's bounties, who disdained The mortal love of the embodied man, And sought the solitude which spirits cast Around their darksome presence. These have loved, Wooed, wedded, and brought home their moonstruck brides Unto the world-sanded eternity. Hast faith in such reports? Sibyl. So lonely am I, That I dare wish to prove them true. Wolfr. Dar'st die? A grave-deep question. Answer it religiously. Sibyl. With him I loved, I dared. Wolfr. With me and for me. I am a ghost. Tremble not; fear not me. The dead are ever good and innocent, And love the living. They are cheerful creatures, And quiet as the sunbeams, and most like, In grace and patient love and spotless beauty, The new-born of mankind. 'Tis better too To die, as thou art, young, in the first grace And full of beauty, and so be remembered As one chosen from the earth to be an angel; Not left to droop and wither, and be borne Down by the breath of time. Come then, Sibylla, For I am Wolfram! Sibyl. Thou art come to fetch me! It is indeed a proof of boundless love, That thou hadst need of me even in thy bliss. I go with thee. O Death! I am thy friend, I struggle not with thee, I love thy state: Thou canst be sweet and gentle, be so now; And let me pass praying away into thee, As twilight still does into starry night. [The scene closes. Voices in the air. As sudden thunder Pierces night; As magic wonder, Wild affright, Rives asunder Men's delight: Our ghost, our corpse; and we Rise to be. As flies the lizard Serpent fell; As goblin vizard, At the spell Of the wizard, Sinks to hell: Our life, our laugh, our lay Pass away. As wake the morning Trumpets bright; As snow-drop, scorning Winter's might, Rises warning Like a spright: We buried, dead, and slain Rise again. Scene III. A garden, under the windows of Amala's apartment. Athulf. Athulf. Once more I'll see thee, love, speak to thee, hear thee; And then my soul shall cut itself a door Out of this planet. I've been wild and heartless, Laughed at the feasts where Love had never place, And pledged my light faith to a hundred women, Forgotten all next day. A worthless life, A life ridiculous! Day after day, Folly on folly! But I'll not repent. Remorse and weeping shall not be my virtues: Let fools do both, and, having had their evil, And tickled their young hearts with the sweet sins That feather Cupid's shafts, turn timid, weep, Be penitent. Now the wild banquet's o'er, Wine spilt, lights out, I cannot brook the world, It is so silent. And that poisonous reptile, My past self, is a villain I'll not pardon. I hate and will have vengeance on my soul: Satirical Murder, help me . . Ha! I am Devil-inspired: out with you, ye fool's thoughts! You're young, strong, healthy yet; years may you live: Why yield to an ill-humoured moment? No! I'll cut his throat across, make her my wife; Huzza! for a mad life! and be a Duke! I was born for sin and love it. O thou villain, Die, die! Have patience with me, heavenly Mercy! Let me but once more look upon that blessing, Then can I calmly offer up to thee This crime-haired head. Enter Amala as bride, with a bridesmaid. O beauty, beauty! Thou shed'st a moony night of quiet through me. Thanks! Now I am resolved. Bridesm. Amala, good night: Thou'rt happy. In these high delightful times, It does the human heart much good to think On deepest woe, which may be waiting for us, Masked even in a marriage-hour. Amala. Thou'rt timid: 'Tis well to trust in the good genius. Are not our hearts, in these great pleasures godded, Let out awhile to their eternity, And made prophetic? The past is pale to me; But I do see my future plain of life, Full of rejoicings and of harvest-dances, Clearly, it is so sunny. A year hence I'll laugh at you for this, until you weep. Good night, sweet fear. Bridesm. Take this flower from me, (A white rose, fitting for a wedding-gift,) And lay it on your pillow. Pray to live So fair and innocently; pray to die, Leaf after leaf, so softly. [Exit. Amala. —Now to my chamber; yet an hour or two, In which years must be sown. Athulf. Stay Amala; An old acquaintance brings a greeting to you, Upon your wedding night. Amala. His brother Athulf! What can he do here? I fear the man. Athulf. Dost love him? Amala. That were cause Indeed to fear him. Leave me, leave me, sir: It is too late. We cannot be together For any good. Athulf. This once we can. O Amala, Had I been in my young days taught the truth, And brought up with the kindness and affection Of a good man! I was not myself evil, But out of youth and ignorance did much wrong. Had I received lessons in thought and nature, We might have been together, but not thus. How then? Did you not love me long ago? More, O much more than him? Yes, Amala, You would have been mine now. A life with thee, Heavenly delight and virtue ever with us! I've lost it, trod on it, and crush'd it. Woe! O bitter woe is me! Amala. Athulf, why make me Rue the inevitable? Prithee leave me. Athulf. Thee bye and bye: and all that is not thee. Thee, my all, that I've forfeited I'll leave, And the world's all, my nothing. Amala. Nay; despond not. Thou'lt be a merry, happy man some day, And list to this as to a tale of some one You had forgotten. Athulf. Now no need of comfort: I'm somehow glad that it did thus fall out. Then had I lived too softly; in these woes I can stand up, and show myself a man. I do not think that I shall live an hour. Wilt pardon me for that my earlier deeds Have caused to thee of sorrow? Amala, Pity me, pardon me, bless me in this hour; In this my death, in this your bridal, hour. Pity me, sweet. Amala. Both thee and me: no more! Athulf. Forgive! Amala. With all my soul. God bless thee, my dear Athulf. Athulf. Kiss I thy hand? O much more fervently Now, in my grief, than heretofore in love. Farewell, go; look not back again upon me. In silence go. [Exit Amala. She having left my eyes, There's nothing in the world, to look on which I'd live a moment longer. Therefore come, Thou sacrament of death: Eternity, I pledge thee thus. [He drinks from a vial. How cold and sweet! It seems As if the earth already began, shaking, To sink beneath me. O ye dead, come near; Why see I you not yet? Come, crowd about me; Under the arch of this triumphal hour, Welcome me; I am one of you, and one That, out of love for you, have forced the doors Of the stale world. Enter Adalmar. Adalm. I'm wearied to the core: where's Amala? Ha! Near her chambers! Who? Athulf. Ask that to-morrow Of the marble, Adalmar. Come hither to me. We must be friends: I'm dying. Adalm. How? Athulf. The cup, I've drank myself immortal. Adalm. You are poisoned? Athulf. I am blessed, Adalmar. I've done't myself. 'Tis nearly passed, for I begin to hear Strange but sweet sounds, and the loud rocky dashing Of waves, where time into Eternity Falls over ruined worlds. The wind is fair, The boat is in the bay, And the fair mermaid pilot calls away. Adalm. Self poisoned? Athulf. Ay: a philosophic deed. Go and be happy. Adalm. God! What hast thou done? Athulf. Justice upon myself. Adalm. No. Thou hast stolen The right of the deserving good old man To rest, his cheerful labour being done. Thou hast been wicked; caused much misery; Dishonoured maidens; broken fathers' hearts; Maddened some; made others wicked as thyself; And darest thou die, leaving a world behind thee That groans of thee to heaven? Athulf. If I thought so— Terrible would it be: then I've both killed And damned myself. There's justice! Adalm. Thou should'st have lived; Devoting every minute to the work Of useful, penitent amendment: then, After long years, you might have knelt to Fate, And ta'en her blow not fearing. Wretch, thou diest not, But goest living into hell. Athulf. It is too true: I am deserted by those turbulent joys. The fiend had made me death-drunk. Here I'll lie, And die most wretchedly, accursed, unpitied Of all, most hated by myself. O God, If thou could'st but repeal this fatal hour, And let me live, how day and night I'd toil For all things to atone! Must I wish vainly? My brother, is there any way to live? Adalm. For thee, alas! in this world there is none. Think not upon't. Athulf. Thou liest: there must be: Thou know'st it, and dost keep it secret from me, Letting me die for hate and jealousy. O that I had not been so pious a fool, But killed thee, 'stead of me, and had thy wife! I should be at the banquet, drinking to her, Kissing her lip, in her eye smiling... Peace! Thou see'st I'm growing mad: now leave me here, Accursed as I am, alone to die. Adalm. Wretched, yet not despised, farewell my brother. Athulf. O Arab, Arab! Thou dost sell true drugs. Brother, my soul is very weary now: Speak comfortably to me. Adalm. From the Arab, From Ziba, had'st the poison? Athulf. Ay. 'Twas good: An honest villain is he. Adalm. Hold, sweet brother, A little longer hold in hope on life; But a few minutes more. I seek the sorcerer, And he shall cure thee with some wondrous drug. He can, and shall perform it: rest thee quiet: Hope or revenge I'll bring thee. [Exit. Athulf. Dare I hope? O no: methinks it is not so unlovely, This calm unconscious state, this breathless peace, Which all, but troublesome and riotous man, Assume without resistance. Here I'll lay me, And let life fall from off me tranquilly. [Enter singers and musicians led by Siegfried; they play under the windows of Amala's apartment, and sing.] Song. By female voices. We have bathed, where none have seen us, In the lake and in the fountain, Underneath the charmed statue Of the timid, bending Venus, When the water-nymphs were counting In the waves the stars of night, And those maidens started at you, Your limbs shone through so soft and bright. But no secrets dare we tell, For thy slaves unlace thee, And he, who shall embrace thee, Waits to try thy beauty's spell. By male voices. We have crowned thee queen of women, Since love's love, the rose, hath kept her Court within thy lips and blushes, And thine eye, in beauty swimming, Kissing, we rendered up the sceptre, At whose touch the startled soul Like an ocean bounds and gushes, And spirits bend at thy controul. But no secrets dare we tell, For thy slaves unlace thee, And he, who shall embrace thee, Is at hand, and so farewell. Athulf. Shame on you! Do you sing their bridal song Ere I have closed mine eyes? Who's there among you That dare to be enamoured of a maid So far above you, ye poor rhyming knaves? Ha! there begins another. Song by Siegfried. Lady, was it fair of thee To seem so passing fair to me? Not every star to every eye Is fair; and why Art thou another's share? Did thine eyes shed brighter glances, Thine unkissed bosom heave more fair, To his than to my fancies? But I'll forgive thee still; Thou'rt fair without thy will. So be: but never know, That 'tis the hue of woe. Lady, was it fair of thee To be so gentle still to me? Not every lip to every eye Should let smiles fly. Why didst thou never frown, To frighten from my pillow Love's head, round which Hope wove a crown, And saw not 'twas of willow? But I'll forgive thee still; Thou knew'st not smiles could kill. Smile on: but never know, I die, nor of what woe. Athulf. Ha! Ha! That fellow moves my spleen; A disappointed and contented lover. Methinks he's above fifty by his voice: If not, he should be whipped about the town, For vending such tame doctrine in love-verses. Up to the window, carry off the bride, And away on horseback, squeaker! Siegfr. Peace, thou bold drunken fellow that liest there!— Leave him to sleep his folly out, good fellows. [Exit with musicians. Athulf. Well said: I do deserve it. I lie here A thousand-fold fool, dying ridiculously Because I could not have the girl I fancied. Well, they are wedded; how long now will last Affection or content? Besides 'twere possible He might have quaffed a like draught. But 'tis done: Villanous idiot that I am to think on't. She willed it so. Then Amala, be fearless: Wait but a little longer in thy chamber, And he will be with thee whom thou hast chosen: Or, if it make thee pastime, listen sweet one, And I will sing to thee, here in the moonlight, Thy bridal song and my own dirge in one. He sings. A cypress-bough, and a rose-wreath sweet, A wedding-robe, and a winding-sheet, A bridal-bed and a bier. Thine be the kisses, maid, And smiling Love's alarms; And thou, pale youth, be laid In the grave's cold arms. Each in his own charms, Death and Hymen both are here; So up with scythe and torch, And to the old church porch, While all the bells ring clear: And rosy, rosy the bed shall bloom, And earthy, earthy heap up the tomb. Now tremble dimples on your cheek, Sweet be your lips to taste and speak, For he who kisses is near: By her the bridegod fair, In youthful power and force; By him the grizard bare, Pale knight on a pale horse, To woo him to a corpse. Death and Hymen both are here; So up with scythe and torch, And to the old church porch, While all the bells ring clear: And rosy, rosy the bed shall bloom, And earthy, earthy heap up the tomb. Athulf. Now we'll lie down and wait for our two summoners; Each patiently at least. Enter Amala. O thou kind girl, Art thou again there? Come and lay thine hand In mine; and speak again thy soft way to me. Amala. Thy voice is fainter, Athulf: why sang'st thou? Athulf. It was my farewell: now I'll sing no more; Nor speak a great deal after this. 'Tis well You weep not. If you had esteemed me much, It were a horrible mistake of mine. Wilt close my eyes when I am dead, sweet maid? Amala. O Athulf, thou might'st still have lived. Athulf. What boots it, And thou not mine, nor even loving me? But that makes dying very sad to me. Yet even thy pity is worth much. Amala. O no; I pity not alone, but I am wretched,— Love thee and ever did most fervently, Still hoping thou would'st turn and merit it. But now—O God! if life were possible to thee, I'd be thy friend for ever. Athulf. O thou art full of blessings! Thou lovest me, Amala: one kiss, but one; It is not much to grant a dying man. Amala. I am thy brother's bride, forget not that; And never but to this, thy dying ear, Had I confessed so much in such an hour. But this be too forgiven. Now farewell. 'Twere not amiss if I should die to-night: Athulf, my love, my only love, farewell. Athulf. Yet one more minute. If we meet hereafter, Wilt thou be mine? I have the right to thee; And, if thou promise, I will let him live This life, unenvied, with thee. Amala. I will, Athulf: Our bliss there will be greater for the sorrow We now in parting feel. Athulf. I go, to wait thee. [Exit Amala. Farewell, my bliss! She loves me with her soul, And I might have enjoyed her, were he fallen. Ha! ha! and I am dying like a rat, And he shall drink his wine, twenty years hence, Beside his cherished wife, and speak of me With a compassionate smile! Come, Madness, come, For death is loitering still. Enter Adalmar and Ziba. Adalm. An antidote! Restore him whom thy poisons have laid low, If thou wilt not sup with thy fellow fiends In hell to-night. Ziba. I pray thee strike me not. It was his choice; and why should he be breathing Against his will? Athulf. Ziba, I need not perish. Now my intents are changed: so, if thou canst, Dispense me life again. Adalm. Listen to him, slave, And once be a preserver. Ziba. Let him rise. Why, think you that I'd deal a benefit, So precious to the noble as is death, To such a pampered darling of delight As he that shivers there? O, not for him, Blooms my dark Nightshade, nor doth Hemlock brew Murder for cups within her cavernous root. Not for him is the metal blessed to kill, Nor lets the poppy her leaves fall for him. To heroes such are sacred. He may live, As long as 'tis the Gout and Dropsy's pleasure. He wished to play at suicide, and swallowed A draught, that may depress and shake his powers Until he sleeps awhile; then all is o'er. And so good night, my princes. [Exit. Adalm. Dost thou hear? Athulf. Victory! victory! I do hear; and Fate hears, And plays with Life for one of our two souls, With dice made of death's bones. But shall I do't? O Heaven! it is a fearful thing to be so saved! Adalm. Now, brother, thou'lt be happy. Athulf. With thy wife! I tell thee, hapless brother, on my soul, Now that I live, I will live; I alone; And Amala alone shall be my love. There's no more room for you, since you have chosen The woman and the power which I covet. Out of thy bridal bed, out of thy throne! Away to Abel's grave. [Stabs Adalmar Adalm. Thou murderous fiend! I was thy brother. [dies. Athulf. (after a pause) How long a time it is since I was here! And yet I know not whether I have slept, Or wandered through a dreary cavernous forest, Struggling with monsters. 'Tis a quiet place, And one inviting strangely to deep rest. I have forgotten something; my whole life Seems to have vanished from me to this hour. There was a foe whom I should guard against; Who is he? Amala. (from her window) Adalmar! Athulf. (in a low voice) Hush! hush! I come to thee. Let me but see if he be dead: speak gently, His jealous ghost still hears. Amala. So, it is over With that poor troubled heart! O then to-night Leave me alone to weep. Athulf. As thou wilt, lady. I'm stunned with what has happened. He is dead. Amala. O night of sorrow! Bear him from the threshold. None of my servants must know where and why He sought his grave. Remove him. O poor Athulf, Why did'st thou it? I'll to my bed and mourn. [retires. Athulf. Hear'st thou, corpse, how I play thy part? Thus had he Pitied me in fraternal charity, And I lain there so helpless. Precious cup, A few drops more of thy somniferous balm, To keep out spectres from my dreams to-night: My eyelids thirst for slumber. But what's this, That chills my blood and darkens so my eyes? What's going on in my heart and in my brain, My bones, my life, all over me, all through me? It cannot last. No longer shall I be What I am now. O I am changing, changing, Dreadfully changing! Even here and now A transformation will o'ertake me. Hark! It is God's sentence muttered over me. I am unsouled, dishumanized, uncreated; My passions swell and grow like brutes conceived; My feet are fixing roots, and every limb Is billowy and gigantic, till I seem A wild, old, wicked mountain in the air: And the abhorred conscience of this murder, It will grow up a lion, all alone, A mighty-maned, grave-mouthed prodigy, And lair him in my caves: and other thoughts, Some will be snakes, and bears, and savage wolves: And when I lie tremendous in the desart, Or abandoned sea, murderers and idiot men Will come to live upon my rugged sides, Die, and be buried in me. Now it comes; I break, and magnify, and lose my form. And yet I shall be taken for a man, And never be discovered till I die. Terrible, terrible: damned before my time, In secret! 'Tis a dread, o'erpowering phantom. (He lies down by the body, and sleeps: the scene closes.) Scene IV. A large hall in the ducal castle. Through the windows in the back ground appears the illuminated city. Enter Isbrand and Siegfried. Isbr. By my grave, Siegfried, 'tis a wedding-night. The wish, that I have courted from my boyhood, Comes blooming, crowned, to my embrace. Methinks, The spirit of the city is right lovely; And she will leave her rocky body sleeping, To-night, to be my queenly paramour. Has it gone twelve? Siegfr. This half hour. Here I've set A little clock, that you may mark the time. Isbr. Its hand divides the hour. Are our guards here, About the castle? Siegfr. You've a thousand swordsmen, Strong and true soldiers, at the stroke of one. Isbr. One's a good hour; a ghostly hour. To-night The ghost of a dead planet shall walk through, And shake the pillars of this dukedom down. The princes both are occupied and lodged Far from us: that is well; they will hear little. Go once more round, to the towers and battlements: The bell, that strikes, says to our hearts ‘Be one;’ And, with one motion of a hundred arms, Be the beacons fixed, the alarums rung, And tyrants slain! Be busy. Siegfr. I am with them. [Exit. Isbr. Mine is the hour it strikes; my first of life. To-morrow, with what pity and contempt, Shall I look back new-born upon myself! Enter a servant. What now? Servant. The banquet's ready. Isbr. Let it wait awhile: The wedding is not ended. That shall be No common banquet: none sit there, but souls That have outlived a lower state of being. Summon the guests. [Exit servant. Some shall have bitter cups, The honest shall be banished from the board, And the knaves duped by a luxurious bait. Enter the Duke, Thorwald, and other guests. Friends, welcome hither in the prince's name, Who has appointed me his deputy To-night. Why this is right: while men are here, They should keep close and warm and thick together, Many abreast. Our middle life is broad; But birth and death, the turnstiles that admit us On earth and off it, send us, one by one, A solitary walk. Lord governor, Will you not sit? Thorw. You are a thrifty liver, Keeping the measure of your time beside you. Isbr. Sir, I'm a melancholy, lonely man, A kind of hermit: and to meditate Is all my being. One has said, that time Is a great river running to eternity. Methinks 'tis all one water, and the fragments, That crumble off our ever-dwindling life, Dropping into't, first make the twelve-houred circle, And that spreads outwards to the great round Ever. Thorw. You're fanciful. Isbr. A very ballad-maker. We quiet men must think and dream at least. Who likes a rhyme among us? My lord governor, 'Tis tedious waiting until supper time: Shall I read some of my new poetry? One piece at least? Thorw. Well; without further preface, If it be brief. Isbr. A fragment, quite unfinished, Of a new ballad called ‘The Median Supper.’ It is about Astyages; and I Differ in somewhat from Herodotus. But altering the facts of history, When they are troublesome, good governors Will hardly visit rigorously. Attention! (reads) “Harpagus, hast thou salt enough, “Hast thou broth enough to thy kid? “And hath the cook put right good stuff “Under the pasty lid?” “I've salt enough, Astyages, “And broth enough in sooth; “And the cook hath mixed the meat and grease “Most tickling to my tooth.” So spake no wild red Indian swine, Eating a forest rattle-snake: But Harpagus, that Mede of mine, And king Astyages so spake. “Wilt have some fruit? Wilt have some wine? “Here's what is soft to chew; “I plucked it from a tree divine, “More precious never grew.” Harpagus took the basket up, Harpagus brushed the leaves away; But first he filled a brimming cup, For his heart was light and gay. And then he looked, and saw a face, Chopped from the shoulders of some one; And who alone could smile in grace So sweet? Why, Harpagus, thy son. “Alas!” quoth the king, “I've no fork, “Alas! I've no spoon of relief, “Alas! I've no neck of a stork “To push down this throttling grief. “We've played at kid for child, lost both; “I'd give you the limbs if I could; “Some lie in your platter of broth: “Good night, and digestion be good.” Now Harpagus said not a word, Did no eye-water spill: His heart replied, for that had heard; And hearts' replies are still. How do you like it? Duke. Poetry, they say, Should be the poet's soul; and here, methinks, In every word speaks yours. Isbr. Good. Do'nt be glad too soon. Do ye think I've done? Three minutes' patience more. A cannibal of his own boy, He is a cannibal uncommon; And Harpagus, he is my joy, Because he wept not like a woman. From the old supper-giver's pole He tore the many-kingdomed mitre; To him, who cost him his son's soul, He gave it; to the Persian fighter: And quoth, “Old art thou, but a fool in blood: “If thou hast made me eat my son, “Cyrus hath ta'en his grandsire's food; “There's kid for child, and who has won? “All kingdomless is thy old head, “In which began the tyrannous fun; “Thou'rt slave to him, who should be dead: “There's kid for child, and who has won?” Now let the clock strike, let the clock strike now, And world be altered! (The clock strikes one, and the hour is repeated from the steeples of the city.) Trusty time-piece, Thou hast struck a mighty hour, and thy work's done; For never shalt thou count a meaner one. [He dashes it on the ground. Thus let us break our old life of dull hours, And hence begin a being, counted not By minutes, but by glories and delights. (He steps to a window and throws it open. Thou steepled city, that dost lie below, Time doth demand whether thou wilt be free. Now give thine answer. (A trumpet is heard, followed by a peal of cannon. Beacons are fixed, &amp;c. The stage is lined with soldiery.) Thorw. Traitor, desperate traitor! Yet betrayed traitor! Make a path for me, Or, by the majesty that thou offendest, Thou shalt be struck with lightning in thy triumph. Isbr. All kingdomless is the old mule, In whom began the tyrannous fun; Thou'rt slave to him, who was thy fool; There's Duke for Brother; who has won? Take the old man away. Thorw. I go: but my revenge Hangs, in its unseen might, godlike around you. [Exit guarded. Isbr. To work, my friends, to work! Each man his way. These present instants, cling to them; hold fast; And spring from this one to the next, still upwards. They're rungs of Jacob's heaven-scaling ladder: Haste, or 'tis drawn away. [Exeunt cæteri. O stingy nature, To make me but one man! Had I but body For every several measure of thought and will, This night should see me world-crowned. Enter a messenger. What news bring'st thou? Messr. Friends of the governor hold the strongest tower, And shoot with death's own arrows. Isbr. Get thee back, And never let me hear thy voice again, Unless to say, “'tis taken.” Hark ye, sirrah; Wood in its walls, lead on its roof, the tower Cries, “Burn me!” Go and cut away the draw-bridge, And leave the quiet fire to himself: He knows his business. [Exit messenger. Enter Ziba armed. What with you? Ziba. I'll answer, When one of us is undermost. Isbr. Ha! Midnight, Can a slave fight? Ziba. None better. Come; we'll struggle, And roar, and dash, and tumble in our rage, As doth the long-jawed, piteous crocodile With the blood-howling hippopotamus, In quaking Nile. Isbr. Not quite so great; but rather, Like to a Hercules of crockery Slaying a Nemean lion of barley-sugar, On a twelfth cake. [They fight: Ziba is disarmed. Now darest thou cry for mercy? Ziba. Never. Eternity! Come give me that, And I will thank thee. Isbr. Something like a man, And something like a fool. Thou'rt such a reptile, That I do like thee: pick up thy black life: I would not make my brother King and Fool, Friend Death, so poor a present. Hence! [Exit Ziba. They're busy. 'Tis a hot hour, which Murder steals from Love, To beget ghosts in. [Enter Siegfried. Now? Siegfr. Triumph! They cannot stand another half hour. The loyal had all supped and gone to bed: When our alarums thundered, they could only Gaze from their frighted windows: and some few We had in towers and churches to besiege. But, when one hornet's nest was burnt, the rest Cried quarter, and went home to end their naps. Isbr. 'Twas good. I knew it was well planned. Return, And finish all. I'll follow thee, and see How Mars looks in his night-cap. [Exit Siegfried. O! it is nothing now to be a man. Adam, thy soul was happy that it wore The first, new, mortal members. To have felt The joy of the first year, when the one spirit Kept house-warming within its fresh-built clay, I'd be content to be as old a ghost. Thine was the hour to live in. Now we're common, And man is tired of being merely human; And I'll be something more: yet, not by tearing This chrysalis of psyche ere its hour, Will I break through Elysium. There are sometimes, Even here, the means of being more than men: And I by wine, and women, and the sceptre, Will be, my own way, heavenly in my clay. O you small star-mob, had I been one of you, I would have seized the sky some moonless night, And made myself the sun; whose morrow rising Shall see me new-created by myself. Come, come; to rest, my soul. I must sleep off This old plebeian creature that I am. [Exit. ACT V. Scene I. An apartment in the ducal castle. Isbrand and Siegfried. Siegfr. They still wait for you in their council chamber, And clamorously demand the keys of the treasure, The stores of arms, lists of the troops you've hired, Reports of your past acts, and your intentions Towards the new republic. Isbr. They demand! A phrase politer would have pleased me better. The puppets, whose heart strings I hold and play Between my thumb and fingers, this way, that way; Through whose masks, wrinkled o'er by age and passion, My voice and spirit hath spoken continually; Dare now to ape free will? Well done, Prometheus! Thou'st pitied Punch and given him a soul, And all his wooden peers. The tools I've used To chisel an old heap of stony laws, The abandoned sepulchre of a dead dukedom, Into the form my spirit loved and longed for; Now that I've perfected her beauteous shape, And animated it with half my ghost; Now that I lead her to our bridal bed, Dare the mean instruments to lay their plea, Or their demand forsooth, between us? Go; And tell the fools, (you'll find them pale, and dropping Cold tears of fear out of their trembling cheek-pores;) Tell them, for comfort, that I only laughed; And bid them all to sup with me to-night, When we will call the cup to counsel. Siegfr. Mean you Openly to assume a kingly power, Nor rather inch yourself into the throne? Perhaps—but as you will. Isbr. Siegfried, I'm one That what I will must do, and what I do Do in the nick of time without delay. To-morrow is the greatest fool I know, Excepting those who put their trust in him. In one word hear, what soon they all shall hear: A king's a man, and I will be no man Unless I am a king. Why, where's the difference? Throne-steps divide us: they're soon climbed perhaps: I have a bit of FIAT in my soul, And can myself create my little world. Had I been born a four-legged child, methinks I might have found the steps from dog to man, And crept into his nature. Are there not Those that fall down out of humanity, Into the story where the four-legged dwell? But to the conclave with my message quickly: I've got a deal to do. [Exit Siegfried. How I despise All such mere men of muscle! It was ever My study to find out a way to godhead, And on reflection soon I found that first I was but half created; that a power Was wanting in my soul to be its soul, And this was mine to make. Therefore I fashioned A will above my will, that plays upon it, As the first soul doth use in men and cattle. There's lifeless matter; add the power of shaping, And you've the crystal: add again the organs, Wherewith to subdue sustenance to the form And manner of one's self, and you've the plant: Add power of motion, senses, and so forth, And you've all kinds of beasts; suppose a pig: To pig add reason, foresight, and such stuff, Then you have man. What shall we add to man, To bring him higher? I begin to think That's a discovery I soon shall make. Thus, owing nought to books, but being read In the odd nature of much fish and fowl, And cabbages and beasts, I've raised myself, By this comparative philosophy, Above your shoulders, my sage gentlemen. Have patience but a little, and keep still, I'll find means, bye and bye, of flying higher. [Exit. Scene II. Another apartment. The Duke, Siegfried, Mario, Ziba and conspirators. A conspirator (to Siegfried) Said he nought else? Siegfr. What else he said was worse. He is no more Isbrand of yesterday; But looks and talks like one, who in the night Hath made a bloody compact with some fiend. His being is grown greater than it was, And must make room, by cutting off men's lives, For its shadowy increase. Conspir. O friends, what have we done? Sold, for a promise, still security, The mild familiar laws our fathers left us; Uprooted our firm country. Ziba. And now sit, Weeping like babes, among its ruins. Up! You have been cheated; now turn round upon him. In this his triumph pull away his throne, And let him into hell. Another conspir. But that I heard it From you, his inmost counsel and next heart, I'd not believe it. Why, the man was open; We looked on him, and saw our looks reflected; Our hopes and wishes found an echo in him; He pleased us all, I think. Let's doubt the worst, Until we see. Duke. Until you feel and perish. You looked on him, and saw your looks reflected, Because his soul was in a dark deep well, And must draw down all others to increase it: Your hopes and wishes found an echo in him, As out of a sepulchral cave, prepared For you and them to sleep in. To be brief, He is the foe of all; let all be his, And he must be o'erwhelmed. Siegfr. I throw him off, Although I feared to say so in his presence, And think you all will fear. O that we had Our good old noble Duke, to help us here! Duke. Of him I have intelligence. The governor, Whose guards are bribed and awed by these good tidings, Waits us within. There we will speak at large: And O! may justice, for this once, descend Like lightning-footed vengeance. Mario. It will come; But when, I know not. Liberty, whose shade Attends, smiles still in patience, and that smile Melts tyrants down in time: and, till she bids, To strike were unavailing. [Exeunt all but Siegfried and Ziba. Ziba. Let them talk: I mean to do; and will let no one's thoughts, Or reasonable cooling counsels, mix In my resolve to weaken it, as little As shall a drop of rain or pity-water Adulterate this thick blood-curdling liquor. Siegfried, I'll free you from this thankless master. Siegfr. I understand. To-night? Why that is best. Man's greatest secret, like the earth's, the devil, Slips through a key-hole or the smallest chink. In plottings there is still some crack unstopped, Some heart not air-tight, some fellow who doth talk In sleep or in his cups, or tells his tale, Love-drunk, unto his secret-selling mistress. How shall't be done though? Ziba. I'm his cup-bearer; An office that he gave me in derision, And I will execute so cunningly That he shall have no lips, to laugh with, long; Nor spare and spurn me, as he did last night. Let him beware, who shows a dogged slave Pity or mercy! For the drug, 'tis good: There is a little, hairy, green-eyed snake, Of voice like to the woody nightingale, And ever singing pitifully sweet, That nestles in the barry bones of death, And is his dearest pet and play-fellow. The honied froth about that serpent's tongue Deserves not so his habitation's name, As doth the cup that I shall serve to him. [Exeunt. Scene III. A meadow. Sibylla and ladies, gathering flowers. Sibyl. Enough; the dew falls, and the glow-worm's shining: Now let us search our baskets for the fairest Among our flowery booty, and then sort them. Lady. The snow-drops are all gone; but here are cowslips, And primroses, upon whose petals maidens, Who love to find a moral in all things, May read a lesson of pale bashfulness; And violets, that have taught their young buds whiteness, That blue-eyed ladies' lovers might not tear them For the old comparison; daisies without number, And butter-cups and lilies of the vale. Sibyl. Sit then; and we will bind some up with rushes, And wind us garlands. Thus it is with man; He looks on nature as his supplement, And still will find out likenesses and tokens Of consanguinity, in the world's graces, To his own being. So he loves the rose, For the cheek's sake, whose touch is the most grateful At night-fall to his lip; and, as the stars rise, Welcomes the memories of delighting glances, Which go up as an answer o'er his soul. Lady. And therefore earth and all its ornaments, Which are the symbols of humanity In forms refined, and efforts uncompleted, Graceful and innocent, temper the heart, Of him who muses and compares them skilfully, To glad belief and tearful gratitude. This is the sacred source of poesy. Sibyl. While we are young, and free from care, we think so. But, when old age or sorrow brings us nearer To spirits and their interests, we see Few features of mankind in outward nature; But rather signs inviting us to heaven. I love flowers too; not for a young girl's reason, But because these brief visitors to us Rise yearly from the neighbourhood of the dead, To show us how far fairer and more lovely Their world is; and return thither again, Like parting friends that beckon us to follow, And lead the way silent and smilingly. Fair is the season when they come to us, Unfolding the delights of that existence Which is below us: 'tis the time of spirits, Who with the flowers, and like them, leave their graves: But when the earth is sealed, and none dare come Upwards to cheer us, and man's left alone, We have cold, cutting winter. For no bridal, Excepting with the grave, are flowers fit emblems. Lady. And why then do we pluck and wreathe them now? Sibyl. Because a bridal with the grave is near. You will have need of them to strew a corpse. Ay, maidens, I am dying; but lament not: It is to me a wished for change of being. Yonder behold the evening star arising, Appearing bright over the mountain-tops; He has just died out of another region, Perhaps a cloudy one; and so die I; And the high heaven, serene and light with joy, Which I pass into, will be my love's soul, That will encompass me; and I shall tremble, A brilliant star of never-dying delight, Mid the ethereal depth of his eternity. Now lead me homewards: and I'll lay me down, To sleep not, but to rest: then strew me o'er With these flowers fresh out of the ghosts' abodes, And they will lead me softly down to them. [Exeunt. Scene IV. The ruined cathedral, the sepulchre, and the cloisters; on which latter is painted the Dance of Death. In the foreground a large covered table, with empty chairs set round it. Moonlight. The clock strikes twelve; on which is heard a Song in the air. The moon doth mock and make me crazy, And midnight tolls her horrid claim On ghostly homage. Fie, for shame! Deaths, to stand painted there so lazy. There's nothing but the stars about us, And they're no tell-tales, but shine quiet: Come out, and hold a midnight riot, Where no mortal fool dare flout us: And, as we rattle in the moonlight pale; Wanderers shall think 'tis the nightingale. (The Deaths, and the figures paired with them, come out of the walls: some seat themselves at the table, and appear to feast, with mocking gestures; others dance fantastically to a rattling music, singing) Mummies and skeletons, out of your stones; Every age, every fashion, and figure of Death: The death of the giant with petrified bones; The death of the infant who never drew breath. Little and gristly, or bony and big, White and clattering, grassy and yellow; The partners are waiting, so strike up a jig, Dance and be merry, for Death's a droll fellow. The emperor and empress, the king and the queen, The knight and the abbot, friar fat, friar thin, The gipsy and beggar, are met on the green; Where's Death and his sweetheart? We want to begin. In circles, and mazes, and many a figure, Through clouds, over chimnies and corn-fields yellow, We'll dance and laugh at the red-nosed grave-digger, Who dreams not that Death is so merry a fellow. (One with a scythe, who has stood sentinel, now sings)Although my old ear Hath neither hammer nor drum, Methinks I can hear Living skeletons come. The cloister re-echoes the call, And it frightens the lizard, And, like an old hen, the wall Cries “cluck! cluck! back to my gizzard; “'Tis warm, though it's stony, “My chickens so bony.” So come let us hide, each with his bride, For the wicked are coming who have not yet died. (The figures return to their places in the wall.) Enter Isbrand, the Duke, Siegfried, Mario, Wolfram as fool, and conspirators, followed by Ziba and other attendants. Isbr. You wonder at my banqueting-house perhaps: But 'tis my fashion, when the sky is clear, To drink my wine out in the open air: And this our sometime meeting-place is shadowy, And the wind howleth through the ruins bravely. Now sit, my gentle guests: and you, dark man, [to Wolfr. Make us as merry as you can, and proudly Bear the new office, which your friend, the pilgrim, Has begged for you: 'twas my profession once; Do justice to that cap. (They sit round the table, and partake of the feast, making gestures somewhat similar to those mocked by the figures.) Duke. Now, having washed our hearts of love and sorrow, And pledged the rosiness of many a cheek, And, with the name of many a lustrous maiden, Ennobled enough cups; feed, once again, Our hearing with another merry song. Isbr. 'Tis pity that the music of this dukedom, Under the former government, went wrong, Like all the rest: my ministers shall look to't. But sing again, my men. Siegfr. What shall it be, And of what turn? Shall battle's drum be heard? The chase's trumpet? Shall the noise of Bacchus Swell in our cheeks, or lazy, sorrowing love Burthen with sighs our ballad? Isbr. Try the piece, You sang me yesternight to sleep with best. It is for such most profitable ends We crowned folks encourage all the arts. Song. My goblet's golden lips are dry, And, as the rose doth pine For dew, so doth for wine My goblet's cup; Rain, O! rain, or it will die; Rain, fill it up! Arise, and get thee wings to-night, Ætna! and let run o'er Thy wines, a hill no more, But darkly frown A cloud, where eagles dare not soar, Dropping rain down. Isbr. A very good and thirsty melody: What say you to it, my court poet? Wolfr. Good melody! If this be a good melody, I have at home, fattening in my stye, A sow that grunts above the nightingale. Why this will serve for those, who feed their veins With crust, and cheese of dandelion's milk, And the pure Rhine. When I am sick o' mornings, With a horn-spoon tinkling my porridge-pot, 'Tis a brave ballad: but in Bacchanal night, O'er wine, red, black, or purple-bubbling wine, That takes a man by the brain and whirls him round, By Bacchus' lip! I like a full-voiced fellow, A craggy-throated, fat-cheeked trumpeter, A barker, a moon-howler, who could sing Thus, as I heard the snaky mermaids sing In Phlegethon, that hydrophobic river, One May-morning in Hell. Song. Old Adam, the carrion crow, The old crow of Cairo; He sat in the shower, and let it flow Under his tail and over his crest; And through every feather Leaked the wet weather; And the bough swung under his nest; For his beak it was heavy with marrow. Is that the wind dying? O no; It's only two devils, that blow Through a murderer's bones, to and fro, In the ghosts' moonshine. Ho! Eve, my grey carrion wife, When we have supped on kings' marrow, Where shall we drink and make merry our life? Our nest it is queen Cleopatra's skull, 'Tis cloven and cracked, And battered and hacked, But with tears of blue eyes it is full: Let us drink then, my raven of Cairo. Is that the wind dying? O no; It's only two devils, that blow Through a murderer's bones, to and fro, In the ghosts' moonshine. Isbr. Pilgrim, it is with pleasure I acknowledge, In this your friend, a man of genuine taste: He imitates my style in prose and verse: And be assured that this deserving man Shall soon be knighted, when I have invented The name of my new order; and perhaps I'll make him minister. I pledge you, Fool: Black! something exquisite. Ziba. Here's wine of Egypt, Found in a Memphian cellar, and perchance Pressed from its fruit to wash Sesostris' throat, Or sweeten the hot palate of Cambyses. See how it pours, thick, clear, and odorous. Isbr. 'Tis full, without a bubble on the top: Pour him the like. Now give a toast. Wolfr. Excuse me: I might offend perhaps, being blunt, a stranger, And rustically speaking rustic thoughts. Isbr. That shall not be: give us what toast you will, We'll empty all our goblets at the word, Without demur. Siegfr. Well, since the stranger's silent, I'll give a toast, which, I can warrant you, Was yet ne'er drunk. There is a bony man, Through whom the sun shines, when the sun is out; Or the rain drops, when any clouds are weeping; Or the wind blows, if Œolus will; his name, And let us drink to his success and sanity;— But will you truly? Isbr. Truly, as I said. Siegfr. Then round with the health of Death, round with the health Of Death the bony, Death the great; round, round. Empty yourselves, all cups, unto the health Of great King Death! Wolfr. Set down the cup, Isbrand, set the cup down. Drink not, I say. Siegfr. And what's the matter now? Isbr. What do you mean, by bidding me not drink? Answer, I'm thirsty. Wolfr. Push aside the boughs: Let's see the night, and let the night see us. Isbr. Will the fool read us astronomic lectures? Wolfr. Above stars; stars below; round the moon stars. Isbrand, don't sip the grape-juice. Isbr. Must I drink, Or not, according to a horoscope? Says Jupiter, no? Then he's a hypocrite. Wolfr. Look upwards, how 'tis thick and full, how sprinkled, This heaven, with the planets. Now, consider; Which will you have? The sun's already taken, But you may find an oar in the half moon, Or drive the comet's dragons; or, if you'd be Rather a little snug and quiet god, A one-horse star is standing ready for you. Choose, and then drink. Isbr. If you are sane or sober, What do you mean? Wolfr. It is a riddle, sir, Siegfried, your friend, can solve. Siegfr. Some sorry jest. Wolfr. You'll laugh but palely at its sting, I think. Hold the dog down; disarm him; grasp his right. My lord, this worthy courtier loved your virtues To such excess of piety, that he wished To send you by a bye-path into heaven. Drink, and you're straight a god—or something else. A conspirator. O murderous villain! Kill him where he sits. Isbr. Be quiet, and secure him. Siegfried, Siegfried; Why hast thou no more genius in thy villany? Wilt thou catch kings in cobwebs? Lead him hence: Chain him to-night in prison, and to-morrow Put a cord round his neck and hang him up, In the society of the old dog That killed my neighbour's sheep. Siegfr. I do thank thee. In faith, I hoped to have seen grass grow o'er you, And should have much rejoiced. But, as it is, I'll willingly die upright in the sun: And I can better spare my life than you. Good night then, Fool and Duke: you have my curse; And Hell will have you some day down for hers: So let us part like friends. My lords, good sleep This night, the next I hope you'll be as well As I shall. Should there be a lack of rope, I recommend my bowstring as a strong one. Once more, farewell: I wish you all, believe me, Happily old, mad, sick, and dead, and cursed. [Exit guarded. Isbr. That gentleman should have applied his talent To writing new-year's wishes. Another cup! Wolfr. He has made us dull: so I'll begin a story. As I was newly dead, and sat beside My corpse, looking on it, as one who muses Gazing upon a house he was burnt out of, There came some merry children's ghosts, to play At hide-and-seek in my old body's corners:— Isbr. But how came you to die and yet be here? Wolfr. Did I say so? Excuse me. I am absent, And forget always that I'm just now living. But dead and living, which are which? A question Not easy to be solved. Are you alone, Men, as you're called, monopolists of life? Or is all being, living? and what is, With less of toil and trouble, more alive, Than they, who cannot, half a day, exist Without repairing their flesh mechanism? Or do you owe your life, not to this body, But to the sparks of spirit that fly off, Each instant disengaged and hurrying From little particles of flesh that die? If so, perhaps you are the dead yourselves: And these ridiculous figures on the wall Laugh, in their safe existence, at the prejudice, That you are anything like living beings. But hark! The bell tolls, and a funeral comes. (A funeral procession crosses the stage; the pall borne by ladies.) Dirge. We do lie beneath the grass In the moonlight, in the shade Of the yew-tree. They that pass Hear us not. We are afraid They would envy our delight, In our graves by glow-worm night. Come follow us, and smile as we; We sail to the rock in the ancient waves, Where the snow falls by thousands into the sea, And the drowned and the shipwrecked have happy graves. (The procession passes out. Duke. What's this that comes and goes, so shadow-like? Attendant. They bear the fair Sibylla to her grave. Duke. She dead! Darest thou do this, thou grave-begotten man, Thou son of Death? (To Wolfram. Wolfr. Sibylla dead already? I wondered how so fair a thing could live: And, now she is no more, it seems to me She was too beautiful ever to die! Isbr. She, who was to have been my wife? Here, fellow; Take thou this flower to strew upon her grave, A lily of the valley; it bears bells, For even the plants, it seems, must have their fool, So universal is the spirit of folly; And whisper, to the nettles of her grave, “King Death hath asses' ears.” Mario. (stabbing Isbrand) At length thou art condemned to punishment Down, thou usurper, to the earth and grovel! The pale form, that has led me up to thee, Bids me deal this; and, now my task is o'er, Beckons me hence. [Exit. Isbr. Villain, thou dig'st deep: But think you I will die? Can I, that stand So strong and powerful here, even if I would, Fall into dust and wind? No: should I groan, And close my eyes, be fearful of me still. 'Tis a good jest: I but pretend to die, That you may speak about me bold and loudly; Then I come back and punish: or I go To dethrone Pluto. It is wine I spilt, Not blood, that trickles down. Enter Thorwald with soldiers. Thorw. Long live duke Melveric, our rightful sovereign! Down with the traitorous usurper, Isbrand! All. Long live duke Melveric! Isbr. Duke Isbrand, long live he! Duke Melveric is deposed. Thorw. Receive the homage Of your revolted city. Duke. Thorwald, thanks. The usurper has his death-wound. Thorw. Then cry, Victory! And Long life to duke Melveric! once more. Isbr. I will live longer: when he's dead and buried, A hundred years hence, or, it may be, more, I shall return and take my dukedom back. Imagine not I'm weak enough to perish: The grave, and all its arts, I do defy. Wolfr. Meantime Death sends you back this cap of office. At his court you're elected to the post: Go, and enjoy it. (He sets the fool's cap on Isbrand's head. Isbr. Bye and bye. But let not Duke Melveric think that I part unrevenged: For I hear in the clouds about me voices, Singing All kingdomless is thy old head, In which began the tyrannous fun; He fetches thee, who should be dead; There's Duke for Brother! Who has won? I jest and sing, and yet alas! am he, Who in a wicked masque would play the Devil; But jealous Lucifer himself appeared, And bore him—whither? I shall know to-morrow, For now Death makes indeed a fool of me. [dies. Duke. Where are my sons? I have not seen them lately. Go to the bridegroom's lodgings, and to Athulf's, And summon both. [Exit attendant. Wolfr. They will be here; and sooner Than you would wish. Meanwhile, my noble Duke, Some friends of mine behind us seem to stir. They wish, in honour of your restoration, In memory also of your glorious deeds, To present masque and dance to you. Is't granted? Duke. Surely; and they are welcome, for we need Some merriment amid these sad events. Wolfr. You in the wall there then, my thin light archers, Come forth and dance a little: 'tis the season When you may celebrate Death's Harvest-home. (A dance of Deaths. In the middle of it enter Amala, followed by a bier, on which the corpse of Adalmar is borne. The dance goes out.) Duke. What's this? Another mummery? Wolfr. The antimasque, I think they call it; 'tis satirical. Amala. My lord, you see the bridal bed that waits me. Your son, my bridegroom, both no more, lies here, Cold, pale, abandoned in his youthful blood: And I his bride have now no duty else, But to kneel down, wretched, beside his corpse, Crying for justice on his murderers. Duke. Could my son die, and I not know it sooner? Why, he is cold and stiff. O! now my crown Is sunk down to the dust, my life is desolate. Who did this deed? Enter Athulf. Wolfr. Athulf, answer thou! Amala. O no! Suspect not him. He was last night Gentle, and full of love, to both of us, And could imagine ne'er so foul a deed. Suspect not him; for so thou mak'st me feel How terrible it is that he is dead, Since his next friend's accused of such a murder: And torture not his ghost, which must be here, Striving in vain to utter one soul-sound, To speak the guiltless free. Tempt not cruelly The helplessness of him who is no more, Nor make him discontented with the state, Which lets him not assert his brother's innocence. Duke. (to Athulf.) Answer! Thou look'st like one, unto whose soul A secret voice, all day and night, doth whisper, “Thou art a murderer.” Is it so? Then rather Speak not. Thou wear'st a dagger at thy side; Avenge the murdered man, thou art his brother; And never let me hear from mortal lips That my son was so guilty. Athulf. Amala, Still love me; weep some gentle drops for me; And, when we meet again, fulfil thy promise. Father, look here! (He kisses Amala's hand and stabs himself. Amala. O Athulf! live one moment to deny it; I ask that, and that only. Lo! old man, He hath in indignation done the deed. Since thou could'st think him for an instant guilty, He held the life, which such a base suspicion Had touched, and the old father who could think it, Unworthy of him more: and he did well. I bade thee give me vengeance for my bridegroom, And thou hast slain the only one who loved me. Suspect and kill me too: but there's no need; For such a one, as I, God never let Live more than a few hours. (She falls into the arms of her ladies. Duke. Thorwald, the crown is yours; I reign no more. But when, thou spectre, is thy vengeance o'er? Wolfr. Melveric, all is finished, which to witness The spirit of retribution called me hither. Thy sons have perished for like cause, as that For which thou did'st assassinate thy friend. Sibylla is before us gone to rest. Blessing and Peace to all who are departed! But thee, who daredst to call up into life, And the unholy world's forbidden sunlight, Out of his grave him who reposed softly, One of the ghosts doth summon, in like manner, Thee, still alive, into the world o' th' dead. (Exit with the Duke into the sepulchre. The curtain falls. L'ENVOI. Who findeth comfort in the stars and flowers Apparelling the earth and evening sky, That moralize throughout their silent hours, And woo us heaven-wards till we wish to die; Oft hath he singled from the soothing quire, For its calm influence, one of softest charm To still his bosom's pangs, when they desire A solace for the world's remorseless harm. Yet they, since to be beautiful and bless Is but their way of life, will still remain Cupbearers to the bee in humbleness, Or look untouched down through the moony rain, Living and being worlds in bright content, Ignorant, not in scorn, of his affection's bent. So thou, whom I have gazed on, seldom seen, Perchance forgotten to the very name, Hast in my thoughts the living glory been, In beauty various, but in grace the same. At eventide, if planets were above, Crowning anew the sea of day bereft, Swayed by the dewy heaviness of love, My heart felt pleasure in the track thou'dst left: And so all sights, all musings, pure and fair, Touching me, raised thy memory to sight, As the sea-suns awakes the sun in air,— If they were not reflections, thou the light. Therefore bend hitherwards, and let thy mildness Be glassed in fragments through this storm and wildness. And pardon, if the sick light of despair Usurp thy semblance oft, with tearful gleam Displaying haunted shades of tangled care In my sad scenes: soon shall a pearly beam, Shed from the forehead of my heaven's queen,— That front thy hand is pressed on,—bring delight. Nor frown, nor blame me, if, such charms between, Spring mockery, or thoughts of dreadest night. Death's darts are sometimes Love's. So Nature tells, When laughing waters close o'er drowning men; When in flowers' honied corners poison dwells; When Beauty dies: and the unwearied ken, Of those who seek a cure for long despair, Will learn. Death hath his dimples everywhere; Love only on the cheek, which is to me most fair. FINIS. THE BRIDES' TRAGEDY First Published, 1822. TO THE REV. H. CARD, M.A. F.R.S. F.A.S. ETC. ETC. ETC.

Lenora, Wife of Mordred. Floribel, her Daughter. Lords, Citizens, Attendants, Guards, &amp;c. ACT I. Scene I. A garden. (Hesperus alone.) Now Eve has strewn the sun's wide billowy couch With rosered feathers moulted from her wing, Still scanty-sprinkled clouds, like lagging sheep, Some golden-fleeced, some streaked with delicate pink, Are creeping up the welkin, and behind The wind, their boisterous shepherd, whistling drives them, From the drear wilderness of night to drink Antipodean noon. At such a time, While to wild melody fantastic dreams Dance their gay morrice in the midmost air, And sleepers' truant fancies fly to join them; While that winged song, the restless nightingale Turns her sad heart to music, sweet it is Unseen on the moss-cushioned sward to lean, And into some coy ear pour out the soul In sighs and whispers. (Enter Floribel.) So late, Floribel? Nay, since I see that arch smile on thy cheek Rippling so prettily, I will not chide, Although the breeze and I have sighed for you A dreary while, and the veiled Moon's mild eye Has long been seeking for her loveliest nymph. Come, come, my love, or shall I call you bride? Flor. E'en what you will, so that you hold me dear. Hesp. Well, both my love and bride; see, here's a bower Of eglantine with honeysuckles woven, Where not a spark of prying light creeps in, So closely do the sweets enfold each other. 'Tis Twilight's home; come in, my gentle love, And talk to me. So! I've a rival here; What's this that sleeps so sweetly on your neck? Flor. Jealous so soon, my Hesperus? Look then, It is a bunch of flowers I pulled for you: Here's the blue violet, like Pandora's eye, When first it darkened with immortal life. Hesp. Sweet as thy lips. Fie on those taper fingers, Have they been brushing the long grass aside To drag the daisy from it's hiding-place, Where it shuns light, the Danäe of flowers, With gold up-hoarded on its virgin lap? Flor. And here's a treasure that I found by chance, A lily of the valley; low it lay Over a mossy mound, withered and weeping As on a fairy's grave. Hesp. Of all the posy Give me the rose, though there's a tale of blood Soiling its name. In elfin annals old 'Tis writ, how Zephyr, envious of his love, (The love he bare to Summer, who since then Has weeping visited the world;) once found The baby Perfume cradled in a violet; ('Twas said the beauteous bantling was the child Of a gay bee, that in his wantonness Toyed with a peabud in a lady's garland;) The felon winds, confederate with him, Bound the sweet slumberer with golden chains, Pulled from the wreathed laburnum, and together Deep cast him in the bosom of a rose, And fed the fettered wretch with dew and air. At length his soul, that was a lover's sigh, Waned from his body, and the guilty blossom His heart's blood stained. The twilight-haunting gnat His requiem whined, and harebells tolled his knell; And still the bee, in pied velvet dight, With melancholy song, from flower to flower, Goes seeking his lost offspring. Flor. Take it then, In its green sheath. What guess you, Hesperus, I dreamed last night? Indeed it makes me sad, And yet I think you love me. Hesp. By the planet That sheds its tender blue on lovers' sleeps, Thou art my sweetest, nay, mine only thought: And when my heart forgets thee, may yon heaven Forget to guard me. Flor. Aye, I knew thou didst; Yet surely mine's a sad and lonely fate Thus to be wed to secresy; I doubt, E'en while I know my doubts are causeless torments. Yet I conjure thee, if indeed I hold Some share in thy affections, cast away The blank and ugly vizor of concealment, And, if mine homely breeding do not shame thee, Let thy bride share her noble father's blessing. Hesp. In truth I will; nay, prithee let me kiss That naughty tear away; I will, by heaven; For, though austere and old, my sire must gaze On thy fair innocence with glad forgiveness. Look up, my love, See how yon orb, dressed out in all her beams, Puts out the common stars, and sails along The stately Queen of heaven; so shall thy beauties, But the rich casket of a noble soul, Shine on the world and bless it. Tell me now This frightful vision. Flor. You will banter me; But I'm a simple girl, and oftentimes In solitude am very, very mournful: And now I think how silly 'twas to weep At such an harmless thing: well, you shall hear. 'Twas on a fragrant bank I laid me down, Laced o'er and o'er with verdant tendrils, full Of dark-red strawberries. Anon there came On the wind's breast a thousand tiny noises, Like flowers' voices, if they could but speak; Then slowly did they blend in one sweet strain, Melodiously divine; and buoyed the soul Upon their undulations. Suddenly, Methought, a cloud swam swanlike o'er the sky, And gently kissed the earth, a fleecy nest, With roses, rifled from the cheek of Morn, Sportively strewn; upon the ethereal couch, Her fair limbs blending with the enamoured mist, Lovely above the portraiture of words, In beauteous languor lay the Queen of Smiles: In tangled garlands, like a golden haze, Or fay-spun threads of light, her locks were floating, And in their airy folds slumbered her eyes, Dark as the nectar-grape that gems the vines In the bright orchard of the Hesperides. Within the ivory cradle of her breast Gambolled the urchin god, with saucy hand Dimpling her cheeks, or sipping eagerly The rich ambrosia of her melting lips: Beneath them swarmed a bustling mob of Loves, Tending the sparrow stud, or with bees' wings Imping their arrows. Here stood one alone, Blowing a pyre of blazing lovers' hearts With bellows full of absence-caused sighs: Near him his work-mate mended broken vows With dangerous gold, or strung soft rhymes together Upon a lady's tress. Some swelled their cheeks, Like curling rose-leaves, or the red wine's bubbles, In petulant debate, gallantly tilting Astride their darts. And one there was alone, Who with wet downcast eyelids threw aside The remnants of a broken heart, and looked Into my face and bid me 'ware of love, Of fickleness, and woe, and mad despair. Hesp. Aye, so he said; and did my own dear girl Deem me a false one for this foolish dream? I wish I could be angry: hide, distrustful, Those penitent blushes in my breast, while I Sing you a silly song old nurses use To hush their crying babes with. Tenderly 'Twill chide you. Song. Poor old pilgrim Misery, Beneath the silent moon he sate, A-listening to the screech owl's cry, And the cold wind's goblin prate; Beside him lay his staff of yew With withered willow twined, His scant grey hair all wet with dew, His cheeks with grief ybrined; And his cry it was ever, alack! Alack, and woe is me! Anon a wanton imp astray His piteous moaning hears, And from his bosom steals away His rosary of tears: With his plunder fled that urchin elf, And hid it in your eyes, Then tell me back the stolen pelf, Give up the lawless prize; Or your cry shall be ever, alack! Alack, and woe is me! Hesp. Not yet asleep? Flor. Asleep! No, I could ever, Heedless of times and seasons, list to thee. But now the chilly breeze is sallying out Of dismal clouds; and silent midnight walks Wrapt in her mourning robe. I fear it's time To separate. Hesp. So quickly late! oh cruel, spiteful hours, Why will ye wing your steeds from happiness, And put a leaden drag upon your wheels When grief hangs round our hearts. Soon will we meet, And to part never more. Flor. Oh! that dear never, It will pay all. Good night, and think of me. Hesp. Good night, my love; may music-winged sleep Bind round thy temples with her poppy wreath; Soft slumbers to thee. [Exeunt. Scene II. A room in Orlando's palace. Claudio and Orlando meeting. Orl. Thanks for thy speed, good Claudio; is all done As I have ordered? Clau. Could I be unwilling In the performance of what you command, I'd say with what regret I led Lord Ernest Into the prison. My dear lord, He was your father's friend— Orl. And he is mine. You must not think Orlando so forgetful As to abuse the reverence of age, An age, like his, of piety and virtue; 'Tis but a fraud of kindness, sportive force. Clau. You joy me much, for now I dare to own I almost thought it was a cruel deed. Orl. Nay, you shall hear. The sums he owed my father, Of which his whole estate is scarce a fourth, Are never to be claimed, if Hesperus, His son, be wedded to Olivia. Now This Hesperus, you tell me, is a votary, A too much favoured votary of my goddess, The Dian of our forests, Floribel; Therefore I use this show of cruelty, To scare a rival and to gain a brother. Clau. Now by the patches on the cheek of the moon, (Is't not a pretty oath?) a good romance; We'll have't in ballad metre, with a burthen Of sighs, how one bright glance of a brown damsel Lit up the tinder of Orlando's heart In a hot blaze. Orl. Enough to kindle up An altar in my breast! 'Twas but a moment, And yet I would not sell that grain of time For thy eternity of heartlessness. Clau. Well, well. I can bear nonsense from a lover; Oh, I've been mad threescore and eighteen times And three quarters; written twenty yards, two nails, An inch and a quarter, cloth measure, of sonnets; Wasted as much salt water as would pickle Leviathan, and sighed enough to set up Another wind;— Orl. Claudio, I pray thee, leave me; I relish not this mockery. Clau. Good sir, attend To my experience. You've no stock as yet To set up lover: get yourself a pistol Without a touch-hole, or at least remember, If it be whole, to load it with wet powder; I've known a popgun, well applied, or even The flying of a cork, give reputation To courage and despair. A gross of garters, Warranted rotten, will be found convenient. Orl. Now you are troublesome. Clau. One precept more; Purge and drink watergruel, lanthorn jaws Are interesting; fat men can't write sonnets, And indigestion turns true love to bile. Orl. 'Tis best to part. If you desire to serve me, Persuade the boy to sacrifice his passion; I'll lead him to Olivia, they were wont In childhood to be playmates, and some love May lie beneath the ashes of that friendship, That needs her breath alone to burst and blaze. [Exeunt. Scene III. A prison. Enter Guards leading Lord Ernest in chains. L. Ern. I pray you do not pity me. I feel A kind of joy to meet Calamity, My old, old friend again. Go, tell your lord, I give him thanks for these his iron bounties. How now? I thought you led me to a prison, A dismal antichamber of the tomb, Where creatures dwell, whose ghosts but half inhabit Their ruinous flesh-houses; here is air As fresh as that the bird of morning sings in, And shade that scarce is dusk, but just enough To please the meek and twilight-loving eye Of lone Religion. 'Tis an hermitage Where I may sit and tell my o'erpassed years, And fit myself for dying. My old heart Holds not enough of gratitude to pay This noble kindness, that in guise of cruelty Compels me to my good. Guard. I am most glad That you endure thus cheerfully; remember Your son's one word will give you liberty. L. Ern. I know he would not do me so much wrong. You think, because I'm white with age, I mourn Such hardships. See, my hand's as firm and steady As when I broke my first spear in the wars; Alas! I am so glad, I cannot smile. Guard. We sorrow thus to leave thee. L. Ern. Sorrow! man, It is a woman's game: I cannot play it. Away; your whining but provokes my spleen. (As the guards are retiring he bursts into a harsh laugh: when they have left the stage he stops short.) They're gone and cannot hear me. Now, then, now, Eyes weep away my life, heart, if thou hast A pulse to strain, break, break, oh break! (Enter Hesperus.) My son, Come here, I'll tell thee all they've done to me, How they have scoffed and spurned me, thrown me here In wretched loneliness Hesp. Alas! my father. L. Ern. Oh set me free, I cannot bear this air. If thou dost recollect those fearful hours, When I kept watch beside my precious boy, And saw the day but on his pale, dear face; If thou didst think me, in my gentlest moods, Patient and mild, and even somewhat kind; Oh give me back the pity that I lent, Pretend at least to love and comfort me. Hesp. Speak not so harshly; I'm not rich enough To pay one quarter of the dues of love, Yet something I would do. Show me the way, I will revenge thee well. L. Ern. But, whilst thou'rt gone, The dread diseases of the place will come And kill me wretchedly. No, I'll be free. Hesp. Aye, that thou shalt. I'll do; what will I not? I'll get together all the world's true hearts, And if they're few, there's spirit in my breast Enough to animate a thousand dead. L. Ern. My son We need not this; a word of thine will serve. Hesp. Were it my soul's last sigh I'd give it thee. L. Ern. Marry. Hesp. I—cannot. L. Ern. But thou dost not know Thy best-loved woos thee. Oft I've stood unseen, In some of those sweet evenings you remember, Watching your innocent and beauteous play, (More innocent because you thought it secret, More beautiful because so innocent;) Oh! then I knew how blessed a thing I was To have a son so worthy of Olivia. Hesp. Olivia! L. Ern. Blush not, though I name your mistress; You soon shall wed her. Hesp. I will wed the plague. I would not grudge my life, for that's a thing, A misery, thou gavest me: but to wed Olivia; there's damnation in the thought. L. Ern. Come, speak to him, my chains, for ye've a voice To conquer every heart that's not your kin? Oh! that ye were my son, for then at least He would be with me. How I loved him once! Aye, when I thought him good; but now—Nay, still He must be good, and I, I have been harsh, I feel, I have not prized him at his worth: And yet I think, if Hesperus had erred, I could have pardoned him, indeed I could. Hesp. We'll live together. L. Ern. No, for I shall die; But that's no matter. Hesp. Bring the priest, the bride. Quick, quick. These fetters have infected him With slavery's sickness. Yet there is a secret, 'Twixt heaven and me, forbids it. Tell me, father; Were it not best for both to die at once? L. Ern. Die! thou hast spoke a word, that makes my heart Grow sick and wither; thou hast palsied me To death. Live thou to wed some worthier maid; Know that thy father chose this sad seclusion; (Ye rebel lips, why do you call it sad?) Should I die soon, think not that sorrow caused it, But, if you recollect my name, bestow it Upon your best-loved child, and when you give him His Grandsire's blessing, add not that he perished A wretched prisoner. Hesp. Stop, or I am made I know not what,—perhaps a villain. Curse me, Oh if you love me, curse. L. Ern. Aye, thou shalt hear A father's curse; if fate hath put a moment Of pain into thy life; a sigh, a word, A dream of woe; be it transferred to mine; And for thy days; oh! never may a thought Of others' sorrow, even of old Ernest's, Darken their calm, uninterrupted bliss; And be thy end—oh! any thing but mine. Hesp. Guilt, thou art sanctified in such a cause; Guards; (they enter) I am ready. Let me say't so low, So quickly that it may escape the ear Of watchful angels; I will do it all. L. Ern. There's nought to do; I've learned to love this solitude. Farewell, my son. Nay, never heed the fetters; We can make shift to embrace. Hesp. Lead him to freedom, And tell your lord I will not,—that's I will. [Exeunt Lord Ernest and guards. Here, fellow; put your hand upon my mouth Till they are out of hearing. Leave me now. No, stay; come near me, nearer yet. Now fix The close attention of your eyes on mine. Guard. My lord! Hesp. See'st thou not death in them? Guard. Forbid it, fate. Hesp. Away! ill-omened hound; I'll be a ghost and play about the graves, For ghosts can never wed. [Exit guard. There, there they go; my hopes, my youthful hopes, Like ingrate flatterers. What have I to do With life? Ye sickly stars, that look with pity On this cursed head, be kind and tell the lightning To scathe me to a cinder; or if that Be too much blessing for a child of sin, But strike me mad, I do not ask for more. Come from your icy caves, ye howling winds, Clad in your gloomy panoply of clouds, And call into your cars, as ye pass o'er The distant quarters of this tortured world, Every disease of every clime, Here shall they banquet on a willing victim; Or with one general ague shake the earth, The pillars of the sky dissolve and burst, And let the ebon-tiled roof of night Come tumbling in upon the doomed world:— Deaf are they still? then death is all a fable, A pious lie to make man lick his chains And look for freedom's dawning through his grate. Why are we tied unto this wheeling globe, Still to be racked while traitorous Hope stands by, And heals the wounds that they may gape again? Aye to this end the earth is made a ball, Else crawling to the brink despair would plunge Into the infinite eternal air, And leave its sorrows and its sins behind. Since death will not, come sleep, thou kindred power, Lock up my senses with thy leaden key, And darken every crevice that admits Light, life, and misery, if thou canst, for ever. Exit. ACT II. Scene I. A chamber in Orlando's palace. Enter Orlando to his Boy asleep. Orl. Boy! he is asleep; Oh innocence, how fairly dost thou head This pure, first page of man. Peace to thy slumbers; Sleep, for thy dreams are 'midst the seraphs' harps, Thy thoughts beneath the wings of holiness, Thine eyes in Paradise. The day may come, (if haply gentle death Say not amen to thy short prayer of being, And lap thee in the bosom of the blest;) I weep to think on, when the guilty world Shall, like a friend, be waiting at thy couch, And call thee up on ev'ry dawn of crime. Boy (awaking.) Dear master, didst thou call? I will not be A second time so slothful. Orl. Sleep, my boy, Thy task is light and joyous, to be good. Boy. Oh! if I must be good, then give me money, I pray thee, give me some, and you shall find I'll buy up every tear, and make them scarcer Than diamonds. Orl. Beautiful pity, thou shalt have enough; But you must give me your last song. Boy. Nay, sir; You're wont to say my rhymes are fit for girls, And lovesick ideots; I have none you praise Full of the heat of battle and the chase. Orl. Sing what you will, I'll like it. Song. A ho! A ho! Love's horn doth blow, And he will out a-hawking go. His shafts are light as beauty's sighs, And bright as midnight's brightest eyes, And round his starry way The swan-winged horses of the skies, With summer's music in their manes, Curve their fair necks to zephyr's reins, And urge their graceful play. A ho! A ho! Love's horn doth blow, And he will out a-hawking go. The sparrows flutter round his wrist, The feathery thieves that Venus kissed And taught their morning song, The linnets seek the airy list, And swallows too, small pets of Spring, Beat back the gale with swifter wing, And dart and wheel along. A ho! A ho! Love's horn doth blow, And he will out a-hawking go. Now woe to every gnat that skips To filch the fruit of ladies' lips, His felon blood is shed; And woe to flies, whose airy ships On beauty cast their anchoring bite, And bandit wasp, that naughty wight, Whose sting is slaughter-red. Orl. Who is thy poet, boy? Boy. I must not tell. Orl. Then I will chide thee for him. Who first drew Love as a blindfold imp, an earthen dwarf, And armed him with blunt darts? His soul was kin To the rough wind that dwells in the icy north, The dead, cold pedant, who thus dared confine The universe's soul, for that is Love. 'Tis he that acts the nightingale, the thrush, And all the living musics, he it is That gives the lute, the harp, and tabor speech, That flutters on melodious wings and strikes The mute and viewless lyres of sunny strings Borne by the minstrel gales, mimicking vainly The timid voice, that sent him to my breast, That voice the wind hath treasured and doth use When he bids roses open and be sweet. Boy. Now I could guess. Orl. What, little curious one? Boy. The riddle of Orlando's feelings. Come, You must not frown. I know the lawn, the cot, Aye, and the leaf-veiled lattice. Orl. I shall task Your busy watchfulness. Bear you this paper, I would not trust it to a doubtful hand. Boy. Unto the wood-nymph? You may think the road Already footed. Orl. Go, and prosper then. [Exeunt. Scene II. The interior of Mordred's cottage. Lenora and Floribel. Flor. My mother, you're too kind, you ought to check These wayward humours. Oh, I know too well I'm a poor, foolish, discontented child; My heart doth sink when Hesperus is gone, And leaves me nought but fears. Forgive me then, If I have vexed you. Len. Dear and gentle soul, You ne'er offended me, but when you said You had offended. When I look on thee, If there's a thought that moistens in my eye, Fear, that thy husband cannot match such goodness, Is looking out there. Flor. Fears of Hesperus! That's not my mother's thought, cast it away: He is the glass of all good qualities, And what's a little virtue in all others Looks into him and sees itself a giant; He is a nosegay of the sweets of man, A dictionary of superlatives; He walks about, a music among discords, A star in night, a prayer 'midst madmen's curses; And if mankind, as I do think, were made To bear the fruit of him, and him alone, It was a glorious destiny. Len. He is a goodly man, and yet they say Strange passions sleep within him. There's Orlando, A gentle suitor; Floribel, he loved you, He had no father, I have often wished What it's too late to tell you. Flor. Mother, your Orlando Is a good gentleman, I wish him well, But to my husband—We'll not talk of him. Yet you shall see I can be cool sometimes, When Hesperus deserves it, as he does Even now for his delay. Len. He's here: I'll leave you, You shall not quarrel with him for my pleasure. [Exit. Enter Hesperus. Hesp. Good morrow, Floribel. Flor. Fair noon to Hesperus; I knew a youth, In days of yore, would quarrel with the lark, If with its joyous matins it foreran His early pipe beneath his mistress' window; Those days are passed; alas! for gallantry. Hesp. Floribel! Flor. Sir, d'ye know the gentleman? Give him my benison and bid him sleep Another hour, there's one that does not miss him. Hesp. Lady, I came to talk of other things, To tell you all my secrets: must I wait Until it fits your humour? Flor. As you please: (The worst of three bad suitors, and his name Began with an H.) Hesp. Good morrow then, again. Flor. Heaven help you, sir, And so adieu. Hesp. Madam, you spoke; you said it, Floribel: I never thought mine ears a curse before. Did I not love thee? Say, have I not been The kindest? Flor. Yes indeed thou hast been. Now A month is over. What would I not give For those four sevens of days? But I have lived them, And that's a bliss. You speak as if I'd lost The little love you gave your poor one then. Hesp. And you as if you cared not for the loss. Oh Floribel, you'll make me curse the chance That fashioned this sad clay and made it man; It had been happier as the senseless tree That canopies your sleep. But Hesperus, He's but the burthen of a scornful song Of coquetry; beware, that song may end In a death-groan. Flor. (sings.) The knight he left the maid, That knight of fickleness, Her's was the blame he said, And his the deep distress. If you are weary of poor Floribel, Pray be not troubled; she can do without thee. Oh Hesperus, come hither, I must weep; Say you will love me still, and I'll believe it, When I forget my folly. Hesp. Dear, I do; By the bright fountains of those tears I do. Flor. You don't despise me much? May I look up And meet no frown? Hesp. Try to look through my breast, And see my truth. But, oh! my Floribel, Take heed how thou dost look unkindly on me; For grey-beards have been kneeling, and with prayers Trying to pluck thee from my bosom; fairness, And innocence, and duty league against thee. Then do't not, sweet, again; for sometimes strange And horrid thoughts bring whispers to my soul: They shall not harm thee, girl. I meant indeed, Hard hearted as I was, to have disclosed A tale of terror; but I'll back again: Why, let the old man die. Flor. Oh no, no, no; We will let no one die, but cherish them With love like ours, and they will soon be well: Stay and I'll tell you how to save him. Hesp. Thou! Excellent loveliness, Thou save him! But I must be gone, or else Those looks will lure a secret from my breast, That threatens both. I'll home and think of something. Meet me to-morrow in the sweet-briar thicket, When twilight fades to evening. I'm in haste. [Exit. Flor. My better thoughts go with thee. It is true He hath too much of human passion in him, But I will hold him dear, and, if again My wicked senses grow so cruel quick As to suspect his kindness, I'll be sure My eyes have got false sight, my ears false hearing, And my whole mind's become a rebel traitress. Enter Orlando's Boy. Boy. These for fair Floribel; you are the one I hear my master talk of, surely, lady; And yet his words are feeble shadowers Of such pure beauty. Please you read his thoughts. Flor. You hold a courtly language for such years; But be you 'ware of compliment akin To falsehood. (reads.) From the sad-souled Orlando. Fie sir; your gifts are dangerous. Look you here, As I disperse the wicked syllables Met in this little parliament of words, And give them to the light and careless winds, So do I bid him tear the thoughts of me Out of his breast, and hold me as a thing Further from him than misery. Boy. It is ungently done,—nay, I must say so,— To hurt the generous blossoms of his love; I am sorry that a hand so beautiful Can be so fell. Flor. Boy, thou dost not know The fears that urge me. Had my Hesperus Seen these or thee, I know not what of ill Must have befallen us. Boy. Lady, you must not weep; I have a ballad which my master hears In his sad moods; it has the art to raise A dimple on the cheek of moody care. I'll sing it you. Flor. Young one, I almost love thee. [Kisses him. Enter Hesperus. Hesp. Why Floribel,—Girl! Painted fickleness! Madam, I'm rude; but Hesperus did not think He could intrude on—what was Floribel. Flor. Nor doth he ever. Hesp. If he does not now, Be sure he won't again. Oh girl, girl, girl, Thou'st killed my heart: I thought thee once, good fool, I will not tell thee what, thou'lt laugh at me. Flor. By heaven! Hesp. Don't name it: do not be forsworn. But why should I regard thy words or oaths? Flor. Hesperus, Hesperus! Hesp. Nay, I should be sorry To cheat the longing boy; he fills thine arms Excellent well, believe it. Urchin, seek me When that mis-featured butter-print of thine Is bearded; I will trim thee with a sword. Flor. Hesperus, thou art mad. Hesp. Better be mad than treacherous. Aye, 'twas well To tear the letters; there might be a husband; No, he shall be no more. Flor. But listen to me, These lips that thou hast kissed,— Hesp. I, and a thousand, Men, boys, and monsters. Flor. And these arms thou callest Beloved and fair— Hesp. And fickle and adulterous. Enough of woman: boy, your paramour Is troublesome, sirrah, milk-blooded imp, Raise her; she loves your silken limbs; I give you All that is mine of her. Flor. Oh! save me, dearest. Hesp. She speaks to you, sir. I beseech you both, Go on; don't heed me: oh, I joy to see Your love-tricks. Flor. By the solemn spousal tie, I charge you, hear me. Hesp. Lady, I will tell you, Though it is needless, what I meant to say, And leave you then for ever. You remember A loving dupe you entertained some while, One Hesperus, you must; oh! that you ever Forgot him. Well, I will be brief. He gave you, And bade you keep it as you would his love, A little bird, a sweet red-bosomed creature, To toy with in his absence: (then he knew not You had another playmate for your chamber.) This bird, it was a creature that I loved, Yet it did not deceive me; I have thought There was a spirit in it—never mind; I dreamed I spoke to one, who valued me And my poor feelings. Unto you I gave it, And you have lost it; in my way I passed Its silent wicker house. Now I have spoken, Perhaps was tedious: but I'm still so foolish, That I will say, good bye. Flor. Oh stay, my love. Hesp. He will, the lovely cub. Flor. Thee, thee I mean. Hesp. I am no lover, I. Madam, we're strangers; And yet I knew some while ago a form Like thine, as fair, as delicate. Oh heaven! To think of it. But she was innocent, Innocent, innocent. Flor. The angels know I am as spotless. Hesp. Go to them; I'm not one; Perhaps this pap-faced chit may be. Nay, girl, Wet not thy cheeks: I've seen a player weep. I will not go, for if I do, the flock Of her warm suitors will be toying here; Yet I'll not stay; for she will melt and pray Till I'm a fool again. Strain not your lungs With laughter when I'm gone. Oh woman, woman. [Exit. Flor. Poor boy, thou hast undone me: lead me in. [Exeunt. Scene III. An apartment in Orlando's palace. Enter Hesperus. Hesp. Oh thou sad self, thou wretched half of Hesperus, Thou'rt lost indeed, there's nought of life about thee, But the one thought, that thou hast saved a father. Now I do think that if I meet a goodness In woman's shape, a fair one I'd not ask, But something that would soothe and comfort me, I could almost love her. Enter Orlando and Olivia. Orl. My brother Hesperus, our poor home is honoured By thy loved father's presence and thine own. Here is a living welcome, prithee know her; Olivia. Hesp. Blessedness, you should have said. A music waits upon her every step, That my heart leaps to. Oliv. Courtly, sir, and kind. Hesp. And fond I would have made it. Oh fair lady, A smile of thine will give me health again. Orl. Sister, thou needst no witness to these blushes. School her, sir, in the arts of compliment, You'll find her an apt learner. [Exit. Oliv. Had I a right to pray to you, I would. Hesp. Pray, lady? Didst thou ever see the goddess Step from her dignity of stone, or leave The hallowed picture in its tinted stole, And crouch unto her suppliant? Oh no; If there is aught so poor a thing as I Can please you with, command it and you bless me. Oliv. Try, I beseech thee, try not to detest, Not utterly to detest a silly girl, Whose only merit is that she'd be thine. Hesp. Hate thee, thou virtue? Oliv. Well, if it must be, Play the deceiver for a little while; Don't tell me so. Hesp. By Truth's white name I'll tell thee, Olivia, there was once an idle thought That aped affection in my heart; nay, nay, Not in my heart; it was a dream or so; A dream within a dream; a pale, dim warmth; But thou hast dawned like summer on my soul, Or like a new existence. Oliv. 'Twere delightful, If credible; but you are all too gallant. Hesp. I knew it must be so: you'll not believe me, But doubt and say 'tis sudden. Do not minute The movements of the soul, for some there are, Of pinion unimpeded, thrice word-swift, Outsoar the sluggish flesh; and these, Olivia, Anticipating their death-given powers, can grasp A century of feeling and of thought; Outlive the old world's age, and be at once In the present, past, and future; while the body Lives half a pulse's stroke. To see and love thee Was but one soul's step. Oliv. Then thou canst endure me; Thou dost not hate the forward maid? My prayer Through many a year has been for that one word; And I have kept the precious thought of thee, Hidden almost from myself. But I'll not speak, For I have told too much, too childishly. Hesp. Dear, I could weep, but that my brain is dry, To think upon thee. Me—'Twere well to court The yellow pestilence, or woo the lightning Unto thy bosom; but to hold me dear— It is a crime of hell; forget you thought it. Oliv. 'Tis sweeter than a virtue, I must love thee. Hesp. And love me truly? Oliv. Heaven grant me life To prove it. Hesp. Then thou shalt be mine own; but not till death: We'll let this life burn out, no matter how; Though every sand be moistened with our tears, And every day be rain-wet in our eyes; Though thou shouldst wed some hateful avarice, And I grow hoary with a daubed deceit, A smiling treachery in woman's form, Sad to the soul, heart-cankered and forlorn; No matter, all no matter. Though madness rule our thoughts, despair our hearts, And misery live with us, and misery talk, Our guest all day, our bed-fellow all night; No matter, all no matter. For when our souls are born then will we wed; Our dust shall mix and grow into one stalk, Our breaths shall make one perfume in one bud, Our blushes meet each other in a rose, Our sweeter voices swell some sky-bird's throat With the same warbling, dwell in some soft pipe, Or bubble up along some sainted spring's Musical course, and in the mountain trees Slumber our deeper tones, by tempests waked: We will be music, spring, and all fair things, The while our spirits make a sweeter union Than melody and perfume in the air. Wait then, if thou dost love me. Oliv. Be it so; You'll let me pray for death, if it will bring Such joys as these? Though once I thought to live A happy bride; but I must learn new feelings. Hesp. New feelings! Aye to watch the lagging clock, And bless each moment as it parts from thee, To court the blighting grasp of tardy age, And search thy forehead for a silver tress As for a most prized jewel. Oliv. I cannot think Of that cold bed diseases make for us, That earthy sleep; oh! 'tis a dreadful thing. Hesp. The very air, I thank it, (the same wild and busy air, That numbers every syllable I speak, In the same instant my lips shape its sound, With the first lips of him, who died before The world began its story;) steals away A little from my being; And at each slightest tremour of a leaf My hearse moves one step nearer. Joy, my love! We're nearer to our bridal sheets of lead Than when your brother left us here just now, By twenty minutes talk. Oliv. It is not good Thus to spurn life, the precious gift of heaven, And watch the coming light of dissolution With such a desperate hope. Can we not love In secret, and be happy in our thoughts, Till in devotion's train, th' appointed hour Lead us, with solemnly rejoicing hearts, Unto our blessed end? Hesp. End! thou sayest. And do those cherries ripen for the worms, Those blue enchantments beam to light the tomb? Was that articulate harmony, (Love uses Because he seems both Love and Innocence When he sings to it,) that summer of sweet breath, Created but to perish and so make The deads' home loveliest? Oliv. But what's to live without my Hesperus? A life of dying. 'Tis to die each moment In every several sense. To look despair, Feel, taste, breathe, eat, be conscious of despair. No, I'll be nothing rather. Hesp. Nothing but mine! Thou flower of love, I'll wear thee in my bosom; With thee the wrath of man will be no wrath, Conscience and agony will smile like pleasure, And sad remembrance lose its gloomy self In rapturous expectation. Oliv. Let me look on thee; Pray pardon me, mine eyes are very fools. Hesp. Jewels of pity, azure stars of beauty Which lost affection steers by; could I think To dim your light with sorrow? Pardon me, And I will serve you ever. Sweet, go in; Somewhat I have to think on. [Exit Olivia. Floribel, I would not have thee cross my path to night; There is an indistinct dread purpose forming, Something, whose depth of wickedness appears Hideous, incalculable, but inevitable; Now it draws nearer, and I do not shudder; Avaunt! haunt me no more; I dread it not, But almost—hence! I must not be alone. [Exit. Scene IV. A tapestried chamber in the same. Hesperus discovered in a disturbed slumber. Hesp. (starting from his couch.) Who speaks? Who whispers there? A light! a light! I'll search the room, something hath called me thrice, With a low muttering voice of toadish hisses, And thrice I slept again. But still it came Nearer and nearer, plucked my mantle from me, And made mine heart an ear, in which it poured Its loathed enticing courtship. Ho! a light. Enter Attendant with a torch. Thou drowsy snail, thy footsteps are asleep, Hold up the torch. Attend. My lord, you are disturbed. Have you seen aught? Hesp. I lay upon my bed, And something in the air, out-jetting night, Converting feeling to intenser vision, Featured its ghastly self upon my soul Deeper than sight. Attend. This is Delusion surely; She's busy with men's thoughts at all night hours, And to the waking subtle apprehension The darkling chamber's still and sleepy air Hath breath and motion oft. Hesp. Lift up the hangings, mark the doors, the corners; Seest nothing yet? No face of fiendlike mirth, More frightful than the fixed and doggish grin Of a dead madman? Attend. Nought I see, my lord, Save the long, varied crowd of warlike shapes Set in the stitched picture. Hesp. Heard ye then? There was a sound, as though some marble tongue Moved on its rusty hinge, syllabling harshly The hoarse death-rattle into speech. Attend. The wind is high, and through the silent rooms Murmurs his burthen, to an heedless ear Almost articulate. Hesp. Thou sleepest, fool; A voice has been at my bedside to-night, Its breath is burning on my forehead still, Still o'er my brain its accents, wildly sweet, Hover and fall. Away and dream again: I'll watch myself. [He takes the torch and turns to the hangings. Exit Attendant. Aye, these are living colours, Those cheeks have worn their youth these hundred years, Those flowers are verdant in their worsted spring And blooming still; While she, whose needle limned so cunningly, Sleeps and dreams not. It is a goodly state, And there is one I wish had ta'en her bed In the stone dormitory. (Blindfold moth, Thou shalt not burn thy life; there, I have saved thee; If thou art grateful, mingle with the air That feeds the lips of her I thought of once, Choak her, moth, choak her. I could be content, If she were safe in heaven.) Yon stout dagger Is fairly fashioned for a blade of stitches, And shines, methinks, most grimly; well, thou art An useful tool sometimes, thy tooth works quickly, And, if thou gnawest a secret from the heart, Thou tellest it not again: ha! the feigned steel Doth blush and steam. There is a snuff of blood. [Grasps his dagger convulsively. Who placed this iron aspic in my hand? Speak! who is at my ear? [He turns, and addresses his shadow. I know thee now, I know the hideous laughter of thy face. 'Tis Malice' eldest imp, the heir of hell, Red-handed Murther. Slow it whispers me, Coaxingly with its serpent voice. Well sung, Syren of Acheron! I'll not look on thee; Why does thy frantic weapon dig the air With such most frightful vehemence? Back, back, Tell the dark grave I will not give it food. Back to thy home of night. What! playest thou still? Then thus I banish thee. Out, treacherous torch, Sure thou wert kindled in infernal floods, Or thy bright eye would blind at sights like this. [Dashes the torch on the ground. Tempt me no more; I tell thee, Floribel Shall never bleed. I pray thee, guilty word, Tempt me no more. [Wraps himself in his mantle. I'm deaf, my ears are safe, I do not hear thee woo me to the deed; Thou tellest to one without auricular sense Olivia's beauties and that bad one's faults. Oh! bring me thoughts of pity. Come, come, come, Or I am lost. Bad goblin, must I fly thee? [Exit. Scene V. A hall in the same. Lord Ernest, Orlando, Claudio, Olivia. L. Ern. Saw ye my son? Oliv. Some hours ago we parted, And he was strange, though gentle, in his talk. Orl. I passed him in the garden, just at twilight; He stood with eyes wide open, but their sense Dreamed, in dumb parley with some fancied thing; For his lips moved, and he did walk and gaze, Now frown most mournfully, now smile most madly, And weep, and laugh, groan deep and gnash his teeth, And now stand still with such a countenance, As does the marble sorrow o'er a tomb. At last he tore his feet, as they were roots, Up from the earth, and sighed like one o'ercome; Then, with his fingers thrust upon his eyes And dashed unclosed away, he seemed to snatch Some loathly object out of them, and leapt Into the thicket's gloom. L. Ern. Who saw him since? Clau. In most distempered wildness he hath left His chamber now. L. Ern. Go seek him, every one, I do beseech you; 'tis a fearful period, I know too truly. On his nurse's breast, Some twenty years ago, he lay and mused Upon her singing and bright merry lips; A viewless bolt dropped on her, and she died Most hideously; close in the infant's face Looked all the horrors of her bursting eyes; And, as the months bring round that black remembrance, His brain unsettles, bloody thoughts oppress And call him from his bed. Search all the darkness, Each one a several way; dear daughter, in. [Exeunt. Scene VI. A suicide's grave. Orlando and Claudio. Clau. There is a plague in this night's breath, Orlando, The dews fall black and blistering from yon cloud Anchored above us; dost thou mark how all The smokes of heaven avoid it and crowd on Far from its fatal darkness? Some men say That the great king of evil sends his spirits In such a winged car, to stir ill minds Up to an act of death. Orl. We may not think so, For there's a fascination in bad deeds, Oft pondered o'er, that draws us to endure them, And then commit. Beware of thine own soul: 'Tis but one devil ever tempts a man, And his name's Self. Know'st thou these rankling hemlocks? Clau. I've seen the ugsome reptiles battening on them, While healthy creatures sicken at the sight. Orl. Five months ago they were an human heart, Beating in Hugo's breast. A parricide Here sleeps, self-slaughtered. 'Twas a thing of grace, In his early infancy; I've known him oft Outstep his pathway, that he might not crush The least small reptile. But there is a time When goodness sleeps; it came, and vice was grafted On his young thoughts, and grew, and flourished there: Envenomed passions clustered round that prop; A double fruit they bore; a double fruit of death. Clau. Enough, Orlando, The imps of darkness listen, while we tell A dead man's crimes. Even now I heard a stir, As if the buried turned them in their shrouds For mere unquiet. Home, it is the time When the hoarse fowl, the carrier-bird of woe, Brings fevers from the moon, and maddening dreams; The hour's unholy, and who hath not sent After the parted sun his orisons, Falls 'neath the sway of evil. [Exeunt. Enter Hesperus. Hesp. Hail, shrine of blood, in double shadows veiled, Where the Tartarian blossoms shed their poison And load the air with wicked impulses; Hail, leafless shade, hallowed to sacrilege, Altar of death! Where is thy deity? With him I come to covenant, and thou, Dark power, that sittest in the chair of night, Searching the clouds for tempests with thy brand, Proxy of Hades; list and be my witness, And bid your phantoms all, (the while I speak What, if they but repeat in sleeping ears, Will strike the hearer dead, and mad his soul;) Spread wide and black and thick their cloudy wings, Lest the appalled sky do pale to-day. Eternal people of the lower world, Ye citizens of Hades' capitol, That by the rivers of remorseful tears Sit and despair for ever; Ye negro brothers of the deadly winds, Ye elder souls of night, ye mighty sins, Sceptred damnations, how may man invoke Your darkling glories? Teach my eager soul Fit language for your ears. Ye that have power O'er births and swoons and deaths, the soul's attendants, (Wont to convey her from her human home Beyond existence, to the past or future, To lead her through the starry-blossomed meads, Where the young hours of morning by the lark With earthly airs are nourished, through the groves Of silent gloom, beneath whose breathless shades The thousand children of Calamity Play murtherously with men's hearts:) Oh pause, Your universal occupations leave, Lay down awhile the infant miseries, That, to the empty and untenanted clay, Ye carry from the country of the unborn; And grant the summoned soul one moment more To linger on the threshold of its flesh; For I would task you. Bear this breath of mine, This inner Hesperus away, and bring Another guest to its deserted home; The mind of him whose dust is on my feet, And let his daring spirit inhabit there But for a passing day. 'Tis here. A wind Is rushing through my veins, and I become As a running water. I see a shadowy image of myself, Yet not my perfect self, a brother self, That steps into my bosom. Am I born Newly, or newly dead? I'll think a little. Have I e'er lived before, or thought or acted? Why no; it was the morning doze of being, I slept content with dreams; but now I wake And find it noon, a time for stirring deeds. Yes, this is life that trembles in my veins, Yes, this is courage warms my heart's full tide: Hesperus is a man, a demon-man, And there's a thing he lives for, shall amaze The emulous bad powers. Lead me on, Mysterious guide, companion wickedness; Olivia calls me forward, and, to reach her, What if we tread upon a world of hearts? Come, ye ill blasts, ye killing visitants Of sleeping men, wild creatures of the air, We'll walk together; come, ye beauteous snakes, Ye lovely fanged monsters of the woods, We'll grovel in the dust and ye shall hiss Your tunes of murder to me. [An ignis fatuus rises. Lo, she's here To light our sports, the Hebe of the dead, Alecto, 'mid her nest of living hair Bearing a star of Tartarus. Lead on. [Exit. ACT III. Scene I. An apartment in Orlando's palace. Hesperus seated. Attendants. Enter to them Claudio. Clau. The bridegroom's here? Attend. Yonder he sits, my lord, And since the morn's first hour, without the motion Even of a nerve, as he were growing marble, Has sat and watched: the sun blazed in at noon With light enough to blind an eagle's ken; He felt it not, although his eyeballs glared Horribly bright: I spoke; he heard me not; And, when I shook his arm, slept on in thought: I pray you try him. Clau. Sir, good Hesperus, I wait at your desire; we are to end Our match at tennis. Will you walk with me? Attend. Your voice is weak as silence to his sense. Enter Orlando. Orl. My brother, you must join us at the banquet; We wait your coming long; how's this? Attend. My lord, Like trance has held him since the dawn of day; He has looked down upon yon wood since then, Speechless and still. Enter Lord Ernest. L. Ern. Now health and good be here, For I have missed my son the livelong day. Why, what an idle loiterer thou art; By this, your vacant sight must ache with gazing Upon that view. Arise; I'd have you with me, To fix upon some posy for the ring You wed your love with. Death! Some fearful change Is here. Speak; speak and tell me if he lives. Attend. He does, my lord, if breathing is to live, But in all else is like the coffined dead; Motion and speech he lacks. L. Ern. O heavens! Orlando, Tell me 'tis false. Orl. I would 'twere in my power, But it doth seem too true. L. Ern. Ride like the wind, Fetch him the aid of medicine. See you not Some vision has come to him in the night, And stolen his eyes and ears and tongue away? Enter Olivia. Oh, you are come in time to see him die; Look, look, Olivia, look; he knows us not; My son, if thou dost hear me, speak one word, And I will bless thee. Orl. He is dumb indeed. Oliv. Let me come near him. Dearest Hesperus, If thou behold'st these poor unbeauteous cheeks, Which first thy flattering kindness taught to blush; Or if thou hearest a voice, that's only sweet When it says Hesperus; oh gentle love, Speak any thing, even that thou hatest Olivia, And I will thank thee for't: or, if some horror Has frozen up the fountain of thy words, Give but a sign. Clau. Lady, alas, 'tis vain. Oliv. (kneeling) Nay, he shall speak, or I will never move, But thus turn earth beseeching his dull hand, And let the grass grow over me. I'll hold A kind of converse with my raining eyes, For if he sees not, nor doth hear, he'll know The gentle feel of his Olivia's tears. Clau. Sweet sir, look on her. Orl. Brother! Oliv. Husband! L. Ern. Son! Kind heaven, let him hear, though death should call him. [Pause, a clock strikes. Hesp. The hour is come. [Exit. Scene II. A room in Mordred's cottage. Floribel alone. Flor. And must I wake again? Oh come to me, Thou that with dew-cold fingers softly closest The wearied eye; thou sweet, thou gentle power, Soother of woe, sole friend of the oppressed, I long to lay me on thy peaceful breast. But once I saw thee, beautiful as moonlight, Upon a baby's lips, and thou didst kiss them, Lingering and oft, (As a wild bee doth kiss a rifled flower, And clips its waist, and drops a little tear, Remorsefully enamoured of his prey;) Come so to me, sweet death, and I will wreath thee An amorous chaplet for thy paly brows; And, on an odoured bank of wan white buds, In thy fair arms I'll lie, and taste thy cool delicious breath, And sleep, and sleep, and sleep. Enter Lenora. O here, good mother, We'll talk together. Len. What; of Hesperus? Methinks he has grown cold. Flor. Oh no; he is More full of courtship than he ever was; Don't think him cold, dear mother, or I may: I'm sure he loves me still; I'll go to him, 'Tis nigh the appointed hour. Len. My child, it is a chill and gloomy evening, So go not out. Thy Hesperus will come, And thou wilt live on every word of his Till thine eyes sparkle. What means this despondence? Flor. Dear mother, I will strive to be at ease, If you desire; but melancholy thoughts Are poor dissemblers. How I wish we owned The wealth we've lost. Len. Why girl, I never heard One such regret escape your lips before; Has not your Hesperus enough? Flor. Too much; If he were even poorer than ourselves, I'd almost love him better. For, methinks, It seemed a covetous spirit urged me on, Craving to be received his bride. I hope He did not think so; if he does, I'll tell him I will not share his wealth, but dwell with you. O that he'd come! How each dull moment drags Its lazy wing along when he is absent. When was he here? Len. Last night. Flor. Last night? Now pr'ythee Don't jeer me so, I'm sure, not many days; But all is night when he's not here to light me, So let it be last night; although that night Had days for hours, yet in Love's book and mine 'Tis but an empty cypher, a black round. Oh, I've not lived, I've not been Floribel Since the last mellow echo of his voice Lent the air music; is't not a sweet voice? What can you liken to it? Len. Pan's honeycomb Of many vocal cells. Flor. How dull you are; There's nought beneath the thunder-choir so grand; The wood-birds and the waterfalls but mock him. He said, dear mother, I should be his countess; To-day he'd come to fetch me, but with day I've laid my expectation in its grave. Dost think he will deceive me? Silly girl, Querulous ingrate, why do I torment me? Sweet mother, comfort. Len. Be you sure he'll come With his whole princely train of friends and kindred, And he will lift thee to his gorgeous car, And place thee at his side, a happy wife. Flor. Fie! you cajole me, like a sulky child, With gilded cars; but oh! I wish 'twere here. How gloomily the clouds look, and the wind Rattles among the brown leaves dolefully; He will be very chill, heap up the fire. Hush! hark! What's that? Len. Only your dear father Heavily breathing in his sleep; he'll wake With his sad smile upon his patient face, Looking so dear in sickness. Flor. But 'twill cure him, When he knows all and sees my bridegroom with me, I know it will: and there's the horse's step, I'll just run out, it is not cold at all.— Len. Go, my love, But you must come to ask your father's blessing, And bring your Hesperus with you. Flor. That I will. [Exeunt. Scene III. A wood. Enter Hubert and a Huntsman. Hub. No answer to our shouts but mocking echo? Where are our fellow huntsmen? Why, they vanished Like mist before the sun, and left us here Lost in the briary mazes. Hunts. Shame on the rogues For this their treatment. But look upwards, Hubert, See what a mighty storm hangs right above us. Hub. The day is in its shroud while yet an infant; And Night with giant strides stalks o'er the world, Like a swart Cyclops, on its hideous front One round, red, thunder-swollen eye ablaze. Hunts. Now mercy save the peril-stricken man, Who 'mongst his shattered canvas sits aghast On the last sinking plank alone, and sees The congregated monsters of the deep For his dead messmates warring all, save one That leers upon him with a ravenous gaze, And whets its iron tusks just at his feet: Yet little heeds his wide and tearless eye That, or the thunder of the mountain flood Which Destiny commissions with his doom; Where the wild waters rush against the sky, Far o'er the desolate plain, his star of hope In mockery gleams, while Death is at his side. [lightning. Hub. That flash hath rent the heavens; this way for shelter. Hunts. Some steps above there stands a noble oak, That from the sun roofs ever-during night With its thickwoven firmament of leaves: Thither betake we. [Exeunt. Enter Floribel. Flor. Hence did I seem to hear a human voice, Yet there is nought, save a low moaning sound, As if the spirits of the earth and air Were holding sad and ominous discourse. And much I fear me I have lost my path; Oh how these brambles tear; here 'twixt the willows; Ha! something stirs; my silly prattling nurse Says that fierce shaggy wolves inhabit here, And 'tis in sooth a dread and lonely place; There, there again; a rustling in the leaves. Enter Hesperus. 'Tis he at last; why dost thou turn away And lock thy bosom from my first embrace? I am so tired and frightened; but thou'rt here; I knew thou wouldst be faithful to thy promise, And claim me openly. Speak, let me hear thy voice, Tell me the joyful news. Hesp. Aye, I am come In all my solemn pomp; Darkness and Fear, And the great Tempest in his midnight car, The sword of lightning girt across his thigh, And the whole dæmon brood of night, blind Fog And withering Blight, all these are my retainers; How: not one smile for all this bravery? What think you of my minstrels, the hoarse winds, Thunder, and tuneful Discord? Hark, they play. Well piped, methinks; somewhat too rough, perhaps. Flor. I know you practise on my silliness, Else I might well be scared. But leave this mirth, Or I must weep. Hesp. 'Twill serve to fill the goblets For our carousal; but we loiter here, The bridemaids are without; well-picked thou'lt say, Wan ghosts of woe-begone, self-slaughtered damsels In their best winding sheets; start not, I bid them wipe Their gory bosoms; they'll look wondrous comely; Our link-boy, Will o' the Wisp, is waiting too To light us to our grave—bridal I mean. Flor. Ha! how my veins are chilled—why, Hesperus! Hesp. What hero of thy dreams art calling, girl? Look in my face—Is't mortal? Dost thou think The voice that calls thee is not of a mouth Long choaked with dust? What, though I have assumed This garb of flesh, and with it the affections, The thoughts of weakness and mortality? 'Twas but for thee; and now thou art my bride; Lift up thine eyes and smile—the bride of Death. Flor. Hold, hold. My thoughts are wildered. Is my fancy The churlish framer of these fearful words, Or do I live indeed to such a fate? Oh! no, I recollect; I have not waked Since Hesperus left me in the twilight bower. Hesp. Come, we'll to our chamber, The cypress shade hangs o'er our stony couch, A goodly canopy; be mad and merry; There'll be a jovial feast among the worms. Fiends, strew your fiercest fire about my heart, [aside. Or she will melt it. Flor. Oh, that look of fury! What's this about my eyes? ah! deadly night, No light, no hope, no help. Hesp. What! Darest thou tremble Under thy husband's arm, darest think of fear? Dost dread me, me? Flor. I know not what to dread, Nor what to hope; all's horrible and doubtful; And coldness creeps— Hesp. She swoons, poor girl, she swoons. And, treacherous dæmons, ye've allowed a drop To linger in my eyes. Out, out for ever. I'm fierce again. Now shall I slay the victim As she lies senseless? ah! she wakes; cheer up, 'Twas but a jest. Flor. A dread and cruel one; But I'll forgive you, if you will be kind; And yet 'twas frightful. Hesp. Why, 'twere most unseemly For one marked for the grave to laugh too loud. Flor. Alas! he raves again. Sweetest, what mean you By these strange words? Hesp. What mean I? Death and murder, Darkness and misery. To thy prayers and shrift; Earth gives thee back; thy God hath sent me for thee; Repent and die. Flor. Oh, if thou willest it, love, If thou but speak it with thy natural voice, And smile upon me; I'll not think it pain, But cheerfully I'll seek me out a grave, And sleep as sweetly as on Hesperus' breast. He will not smile, he will not listen to me. Why dost thou thrust thy fingers in thy bosom? Oh search it, search it; see if there remain One little remnant of thy former love, To dry my tears with. Hesp. Well, speak on; and then, When thou hast done thy tale, I will but kill thee. Come tell me all my vows, how they are broken, Say that my love was feigned, and black deceit; Pour out thy bitterest, till untamed wrath Melt all his chains off with his fiery breath, And rush a-hungering out. Flor. Oh piteous heavens! I see it now, some wild and poisonous creature Hath wounded him, and with contagious fang Planted this fury in his veins. He hides The mangled fingers; dearest, trust them to me, I'll suck the madness out of every pore, So as I drink it boiling from thy wound Death will be pleasant. Let me have the hand, And I will treat it like another heart. Hesp. Here 'tis then; [stabs her. Shall I thrust deeper yet? Flor. Quite through my soul,— That all my senses, deadened at the blow, May never know the giver. Oh, my love, Some spirit in thy sleep hath stolen thy body And filled it to the brim with cruelty. Farewell! and may no busy deathful tongue Whisper this horror in thy waking ears, Lest some dread desperate sorrow urge thy soul To deeds of wickedness. Whose kiss is that? His lips are ice. Oh my loved Hesperus, Help! [Dies. Hesp. What a shriek was that; it flew to heaven, And hymning angels took it for their own. Dead art thou, Floribel; fair, painted earth, And no warm breath shall ever more disport Between those rubious lips: no, they have quaffed Life to the dregs, and found death at the bottom, The sugar of the draught. All cold and still; Her very tresses stiffen in the air. Look, what a face: had our first mother worn But half such beauty, when the serpent came, His heart, all malice, would have turned to love. No hand but this, which I do think was once Cain, the arch-murtherer's, could have acted it. And I must hide these sweets, not in my bosom; In the foul earth. She shudders at my grasp; Just so she laid her head across my bosom When first—oh villain! which way lies the grave? [Exit. Enter Hubert and a Huntsman. Hub. It is a fearful and tempestuous time: The concave firmament, the angel's bridge O'er the world's day and night, is visibly Bowed down and bent beneath its load of thunder; And through the fiery fissures of the clouds Glistens the warfare of armed elements, Bellowing defiance in earth's stunned ear, And setting midnight on the throne of day. Hunts. The roar has ceased; the hush of intercalm 'Numbs with its leaden finger Echo's lips, And angry spirits in mid havoc pause, Premeditating ruin in their silence. Hub. Hard by should stand a lone and tattered shed, Where some tired woodsman may by chance be stretched, Watching his scanty food among the coals; There may we chafe our drenched and chilly limbs. Hunts. The forest has more tenants than I knew: Look underneath this branch; seest thou not yonder, Amongst the brushwood and the briary weeds, A man at work? Hub. My life upon't some miser, Who in the secret hour creeps to his hoard, And, kneeling at the altar of his love, Worships that yellow devil, gold. Hunts. 'Tis buried; And now he stamps the sod down, that no light May spy his mistress; with what a doleful look He marks its grave, and backward walks away, As if he left his all of sight behind. Hub. Let us steal towards it; I would have a peep Upon this hidden jewel. [Exeunt. Enter Hesperus. Hesp. Shall I turn back and try to thrust my soul In at her lips, and so re-animate The beauteous casket while this body dies? I cannot:—not the universe of breath Could give those little lips their life again. I've huddled her into the wormy earth, And left the guilty dagger at her side. Dead Innocence! and must unkindly thistles, And rank thick hemlock, force their bristling roots Into thy lovely breast? Fool! Is't not done? Why stand I tampering midst the listening winds? My fears are lying traitors. [Bells at a distance. Wedding bells, Thanks for your merry voices; ye have waked A sudden hurry round about my heart, I'll think it joy. Now for my second bride. [Exit. Scene IV. A saloon in Orlando's palace. Olivia, Violetta, Nurse, and Attendants. Oliv. You keep me long: am I not yet attired? Have ye not tricked me out enough? In faith, I am so vain to think I need no more. Attend. One moment, madam; This little necklace, like the marriage yoke Pleasantly binding, I must clasp around you. Oliv. A pretty toy, and prettily disposed; I have, I know not why, this livelong day Wept drops enough to bead a thousand such. Where's Violetta? Come, look up, my girl, Make thine eyes sparkle; mine are very moist. Viol. Shake off this sadness, lady, 'tis not meet At such a moment; think upon your bridegroom, How his affections seek thee. Oliv. Gentle maid, I'll not be sad; yet, little Violet, How long I've worn thy beauty next my heart, Aye, in my very thoughts, where thou hast shed Perpetual summer: how long shared thy being: Like two leaves of a bud, we've grown together, And needs must bleed at parting. Viol. No, not so; I am thy handmaid still; and when your lord Is absent, as he will be, at the tourney, The court, or camp, we'll drive the long hours on With prattle as of old. Oliv. Thanks, I'll be cheerful; But joy's a plant the showers of many sorrows Must water, ere it bloom. Good nurse, your pardon, You've known me for a froward child before. Nurse. Now, on the scanty remnant of my life, Grief's an ill wedding garment; if you'd put One of your rosy smiles on, what a grace You'd look and be. Why, all these ohs and sobs Are more like funeral noises. Oliv. 'Troth they are, And 'tis the funeral of that Olivia You nursed and knew; an hour and she's no more, No more the mistress of her own resolves, The free partaker of earth's airs and pleasures; My very love, the poorest gift I have, (Which, light as 'tis, I thought you all did prize,) Is not my own. We must be strangers, girls; Give me your hands and wishes. Nurse. There is one, Old now, and withered, truly we might call it Yours, and not mine; oft has it brought you food, Led you, and served you; yet in gladness parts To make way for a younger and a worthier. Oliv. My kind old nurse; nay, now you are forgetting Your words of cheer; this hand shall never want Aid while I live, your service will be needful; My house would seem a strange and dismal place Without your pleasant looks. Nurse. Well, my dear child, I hope you'll give my arms a new Olivia; Blush not; the old will talk. Oliv. Whose hand is this I know not from my own? Young Violet's? My beauteous innocence, you must be with me Oft, as you said: Go to, my nurse forbids Our weeping. Viol. Don't chide me then, Olivia, I'm a sad fool, but do not chide. Oliv. A gem For Friendship's crown, each drop. My loving maids, To each a farewell that I cannot speak; All have my heart, and well can read its meaning. Henceforth I'll look upon my maiden years As lovely pastoral pictures; all of you Shall smile again 'neath Memory's wizard pencil; The natural beauties that we've marked together Will look you back again; the books we've loved Will talk to me of your sweet-worded praises, The air of our old haunts whisper your voices; Trust me, I'll not forget you. Attend. Dearest lady, May all the blessings that rain down from heaven Upon the marriage-bed, descend on yours; May many children, innocent and fair, With soft embracements throng about your knees, Domestic pleasures ever turn your hour-glass, And, when the long sleep falls upon your eyes, Content and holy Peace, the twins of Eden, Draw round the curtain 'twixt you and the world, And watch beside you all the dreary night. Scene V. A room in Mordred's cottage. Enter Lenora supporting Mordred. Mor. Here let me rest, in my old oaken chair: My limbs grow faint, and yet, kind, careful nurse, Your smiles have chased away my pains. Len. Dear husband, A thousand thanks for those delightful words; They bid me hope again and warm my heart. Mor. It renovates the spirit thus to look, With the clear eye of health and joyousness, Upon the green creation. But I miss A smile of hope, the copy of Lenora's, That's wont to light my soul with its rich love; Where is my peach-cheeked girl, my Floribel? Len. She will be with us soon; before you woke, She went to ramble underneath the boughs, And feed her forest birds; each bower she knows Of eglantine and hawthorn; now the air Is calm, she will return. Mor. I hope she may; Yet who could injure such a holy thing? The frenzied tempest's self, had it a will, Would leave her path secure. My dear Lenora, There is one thing I wish to see accomplished Before I die. Len. What is it, love? And yet methinks 'twere fit For me still to defer its execution, And cheat you into living to that end. Mor. Long have I prayed to see her beauty growing Under some worthy husband's firm protection. Len. What if she be already wedded? Mor. No, That cannot be, she would have told unto me The first emotions of her infant love; She never had a thought concealed from me, Even her slightest. 'Tis impossible; And yet you look in earnest; speak, and tell me You only jest. Len. I speak indeed the truth; Perhaps I was imprudent not to tell you, But you were very ill, and, such the match, You could not disapprove: Young Hesperus— Mor. Lord Ernest's son! Len. The same. Mor. I'm satisfied, My wish is all fulfilled. There's not a man Beneath the sun more noble; but his father Was wont to be a stern imperious lord, A scorner of the poor. Len. He did not know it. Mor. He knew it not! That was a sad omission, Unworthy of a parent; we might rue it. Len. This night our daughter's bridegroom Comes, as his own to claim her, and, ere this, Doubtless has told the love-tale to his father. Mor. I wish him speedy, he shall find a welcome, In the poor man's sole wealth, my hearty love. Hark! There's a step. Len. 'Tis Hesperus'; I know it. Enter the Huntsman. Mor. Who comes, who is it? Len. One, whose visage wears The darkest sadness; such a man I'd choose For the mute herald of disaster. Hunts. Lady, Would that my looks could mirror to your soul The woe, each syllable of which in speaking Tears through my heart. Alas! your lovely daughter— Len. What? Speak I pray thee. Has she met with aught? Mor. Bid me die, or my fears. Enter Hubert with the body of Floribel. Hunts. Here's all that's left Of nature's rarest work: this lifeless all. Oh! fall some strange, unheard-of punishment On Hesperus' head. Mor. Hesperus, Hesperus; oh! [Falls back in his chair. Hub. Aye, 'twas his hand that wrought its passage here, And murdered love in its most sacred temple. [Lenora takes the body into her lap and sits nursing it. Hunts. Alas! he heeds not; he is with his daughter. Look at this other. Hub. Oh! I cannot bear it; Leave her, a mother's agony is holy As nature's mysteries. Hunts. We'll to the Duke, And crush the viper in his nest, before Report alarm him. Gently, gently tread And wake not echo in this home of woe. [Exeunt Hubert and the Huntsman. Len. [Sings in a distracted manner. Lullaby, lullaby, sweet be thy sleep! Thou babe of my bosom, thou babe of my love; Close, close to my heart, dear caresser, you creep, And kiss the fond eyelid that watches above. One touch of those warm lips and then to bed. Where is my child? I held her in my arms, Her heart was beating in my bosom. Ha! It is not she that lies upon my breast, It is not she that whispers in my ear, It is not she that kisses my salt cheek; They've stolen her from my couch and left this changeling, Men call Despair—and she it is I suckle. I know her by her killing lips of snow, Her watery eye-balls and her tear-swoll'n cheeks. My Floribel! oh they have ta'en her soul To make a second spring of it, to keep The jarring spheres in melody. Come, husband, We'll wander up and down this wintry world, And, if we see a sadder sight than this, Or hear a tale, though false, of half such horror, We'll closely hug our bosom-griefs in transport. Why, husband! You're asleep—you're deaf—you're dead! I have not eyes enough to weep for both, But I'll go steal the sleeping world's, and beg A little dew from every sipping worm To wet my cheeks with. [Exit. ACT IV. Scene I. An apartment in Orlando's palace. Hesperus alone. Hesp. How now? This quaint attire of countenance, (Well fitted by prim Conscience's old tailor, Hypocrisy,) sits rarely, and I'm here, The affable, good bridegroom. Wickedness, How easy is thy lesson! Now I stand Up to the throat in blood; from Mercy's records For evermore my guilty name is rased. But yesterday, oh blessed yesterday, I was a man; And now—I start amazed at myself. This hand, aye this it was I gave to Sin, His grasp hath blasted it; 'twas made for kindness, For gentle salutation, to deal out Merciful alms, confirm the staff of age; To reach the crust to want, the balm to sickness, And balsam wounds; a limb of charity. Now the wild adder's sting, the lightning's edge, Are blunt and tame and gentle to it. Psha! Why then, men dread the adder and the flash; So shall they cringe to me. A step! In haste I've washed, and thought me spotless. Yet I fear Mine eye is so familiarized with blood, It doth pass o'er and disregard the stains: That recks not. Sure I've brushed away those blushes, And shaken hesitation from my tongue. Enter Attendant. Menial, you're hasty in intruding thus. Your errand? Attend. Lady Olivia— Hesp. Give me thine hand. That name Makes him my friend, who speaks it. Say't again; Olivia, oh! how each sweet syllable Trickles along the tongue, an honied drop Of harmony, Olivia. I'll give all The yellow wretchedness of human wealth Unto the subtle artist, who shall teach A clock to tell the seconds by that word; So shall I drive these frightful thoughts away, And happiness—Do I look happy, sirrah? It matters not. Speak on. Attend. My lord, your bride— Hesp. Well sir, it was not I; why lookest thou so? Beware. Why layest thine hand across thy breast? Is there a wound on't? Say. Attend. A wound, my lord! I understand not— Hesp. Fool, I know thou dost not. (If they would find it out, why let them dig To hell's foundations.) What! Because I fold Mine arms like any man unhurt, unhurting, Must every slave suppose 'tis to conceal Some fearful witness of a deed? Attend. I thought not 'Twould anger thee; forgive me. Hesp. Be it so; It was too warmly said, for, as I trust, You could not deem your master villain; never. Yet say it were so, I but say suppose, That I, whose clay is kneaded up with tears, Had murdered, as you thought, some kindred creature; Could not I wash the tokens of my guilt From this outside, and show a hand as clean As he who fingers first the air? Attend. You might, Till heaven's justice blasted you, be hid: But leave these strange and ugly arguments; The very fear would scare me from your side; So banish them. Hesp. Ay, they are strange indeed; But mirth, believe me, mirth. Come, tell me now, How sits this ring? Death! are your eyes nailed there? Ha! Does the ruby cast a sanguine shade Across the veins? Attend. Nought, save the splendid gem, Amazed my sight; that's all. Hesp. My friend, 'tis thine, Too poor a recompense for the good tidings Your tongue is laden with; now speak them out. Attend. First let me bless you for your bounty, sir. I came to call you to the wedding train, Which waits without; such smiles, on such rare faces, Mine eyes have never seen: the bride is there; None but yourself is wanting to perfect This sum of joy. Hesp. Say I'll be there anon; And, mark me, on thy life forget each word I just have spoken, blot them utterly Out of thy mind; I can reward a service. I like thee well, my trusty, pleasant friend; Nay, pr'ythee go, there is no need of thanks. [Exit Attendant. I'll give that fellow's blab-tongue to the worms, He's heard too much; 'twere well to call him back, And fasten down his memory with a dagger. No, I'll not soil my skin again to-day; Down, Murder, down! These untamed passions, that I keep about me, Will thrive on nought save blood; but they must fast, And wear a specious tameness. My Olivia, How my whole soul is thine,—thine and the fiends'. [Exit. Scene II. The interior of the Duke's palace. Enter the Duke, Hubert, and the Huntsman. Duke. Your tale hath stunned me with its dreadful import, And turned my every faculty to wonder. Hub. You cannot doubt, my liege? Duke. Hubert, I'd give The best part of my power for hope to whisper A no to my conviction. Devilish villain! Hub. Sure all good angels looked another way, When this foul deed was done. Duke. All ancient cruelties Look pale to it, and merciful: henceforth They, that would christen human fiends, must write Hesperus, 'stead of Cain; and chiding nurses, To still their peevish babes, shall offer them, Not to the wolves, but him, the fiercer beast. Hub. Oh! my good lord, even now my sight is dimmed With the salt gush, that came between my eyes And that which seared them: on her turfy couch, Like one just lulled into a heavy sleep, Smiling and calm she lay; the breath Had not left fluttering up and down her bosom, That, all blood-dabbled and besprent with gore, Still held the guilty steel; the name was on it Of the cursed owner. Duke. Go, trusty Hubert, Speed to Orlando's palace with my guard, And drag the murderer here; e'en now I'll judge him: Be diligent, put wings upon your feet; Some vengeance will fall on us in the night, If he remain unsentenced. [Exeunt. Scene III. A banqueting hall. Lord Ernest, Orlando, Claudio, Olivia, Violetta, Lords, Ladies, and Attendants. L. Ern. Sit here, my daughter; sit and welcome, all; You shall not say my Hesperus' nuptial night Lacks its due orgies. Clau. Look upon the bride, How blushes open their envermeiled leaves On her fair features. L. Ern. Sit, I pray you, sirs, We will have deep and jovial carousal; Put on the smiles of joy, and think of nought But present pleasure, we've had woes enough; Bid 'em be merry, daughter. Oliv. Gentlemen, My father wills me give you all a welcome, And, if you love or honour our poor house, Be glad with us. Clau. We thank your courtesy, lady, and obey. L. Ern. Where is this dilatory bridegroom still? He was not wont to lag; what hast thou done To banish him, Olivia? Oliv. Good, my lord, I fear his heart is ill. A veil of gloom Darkens his cheeks, an anxious watchfulness Plays in his eyes; and, when he clasped my hand Now in the chapel, though he smiled and whispered Of bliss and love, an ague thrilled his veins, And starting back he groaned. L. Ern. Go, fetch him hither, I warrant wine will cure him. Attend. Here he comes. Enter Hesperus. Hesp. (aside.) What's all this blaze and riot? Oh, a banquet. They should have got me here the seven sins, And all the evil things that haunt the world; Then what a goodly revel would we hold; E'en Death, while hastening to the sick man's pillow, Should pause to listen our unhallowed talk, And think us all the brood of Pestilence Met in mysterious council. Attend. Sir, your father Has been enquiring for you, and desires The comfort of your presence at the table. Hesp. The comfort of my presence! Slave, thou mockest me. Why dost thou thrust thy taper in my face? No price is set on't. L. Ern. Hither, Hesperus; Thou dost not mark this company of kinsmen, Met to congratulate you, and partake Your gladness. Hesp. Sirs, I thank you heartily. (aside.) A curse upon the gaping saucy rabble; They must stare too. L. Ern. Come, son, and sit beside me; They say you're ill, my boy. Hesp. They say the truth. L. Ern. What is your ailment? Hesp. Life. But here is one Born to smile misery out of the world: Look on me, my Olivia. Oliv. Dearest Hesperus, Be calmer, I beseech you; all are here My friends, and yours. Hesp. No doubt. They drain our goblets. A friend! What is't? A thing shall squeeze your hand, Caress with fervent love your broidered sleeve, And wring his mouth into a leering lie, While his heart damns thee. One whose love's as deep As your gold coffer. Hast a wife? They come; Buz, buz, lie, lie, the hungry meat-flies come, “Dear lord, sweet lord, our only gentle lord!” Ay, thus they sugar o'er the silent dagger, And love, and love, till they've inhelled thy soul. Oh! when I call for friend, bring honest poison. Put out the lights, I like the beams o' th' moon; And tell those revellers to tope in silence. L. Ern. You would not overcast our best-meant mirth, Bid us sit palled, like mourners at your bridal, And hide in night our kindly countenances? Hesp. Ay, by my grave I would. There is on earth One face alone, one heart, that Hesperus needs; 'Twere better all the rest were not. Olivia, I'll tell thee how we'll 'scape these prying eyes; We'll build a wall between us and the world, And, in some summer wilderness of flowers, As though but two hearts beat beneath the sun, Consume our days of love. L. Ern. I pray you, friends, Excuse the wilful boy, his soul is wholly Wrapt up in admiration of his bride: We'll have her health; come, fill your goblets round, The bride, Olivia. Clau. Happiness befall her, May she ne'er feel a woe; we drink to her. [Music. Enter Hubert. Hub. Hush, hush; ye ill-timed sounds, let darkness come, And with her funeral trappings hang the walls, Or twilight lend a weak and fitful gleam, That you may watch each others' watery cheeks. Oh! ladies, deck your beauties with salt diamonds, Wail with the midnight wind, and look as sad As if ye heard the thunder-voice of doom. L. Ern. What art thou, fearful man? Hub. Woe's harbinger; I come to bid you to a funeral; Prepare your eyes, for they must see dire vengeance Fall on the neck of crime. Hesp. Turn out that fellow; I know him for a crazy marvel-monger, A long-faced gossip, with his batch of wonders: And now he'll tell you the most terrible news, How many owls and ravens screeched last night, Or how some ghost has left his marble tomb To blab a drunken lie. Hub. I tell a fiend His guilt is hid no more. Ho! there, the guard: Enter Guards. That is your prisoner. Hesp. You tread a scorpion: The first that stirs brings to my sword his heart; Ye plunge into your graves. [The Guards seize him. Ah! Floribel; Thou draggest my steel away, thou'st frozen me: Girl, thou art pale. L. Ern. How's this? Ruffians, where do you bear my boy? Release him, Or I'll— Oliv. Oh! do not anger them. They're men Who have sucked pity from their mothers' breasts, They will not close their ears to my petition; And, if they'll loose him, I will pray for them While speech is mine. L. Ern. Your swords, my friends, your swords. Hub. Stand back, my lords; let the Duke's prisoner pass. L. Ern. The Duke! what Duke dare seize my Hesperus? My noble friends, my—sheath your coward swords, And put your eyes upon the ground for fear, Your Jove, the Duke he said;—hear ye no thunder? But all the warriors of the universe Shall not cow me: I'll free him; villains, back. Hub. Oh! good old man; alas! he is a murderer. L. Ern. A murderer! (drops his sword.) This is a baby's arm. Oliv. Save him, oh save him! I am very faint. [Orlando, Violetta, and Attendants, carry her out. Hesp. Hence with that voice! So shrieked—I must not think. Hub. Look to Lord Ernest. The Duke sits in council, Waiting your presence, lords. On, to the palace. [Exeunt Claudio, Hubert, Hesperus, Guards, Lords, and Ladies. Manent Lord Ernest and Attendants. L. Ern. Where is he? What! Ye traitors, let him pass, Chained, guarded? By this light—gird on your swords. My hairs are grey, but yet I've blood enough— Did they not speak of crime? These limbs aren't mine, But some consumptive girl's.—Ay, it was murder! I'll see the Duke—support me to the palace. [Exeunt. Scene IV. A street before the ducal palace. Two Guards attending the body of Floribel; Lenora hanging over it. 1st Guard. 'Tis time to bear the body to the council: The criminal is there already. 2nd Guard. Stay; 'Twere sacrilege to shake yon mourner off, And she will perish in the wintry night, If unattended: yet this poor dumb witness Is needful at the trial. While she sleeps With careful hands convey her to the Duke's, And bid the women tend her. 1st Guard. Soft! She breaks Her trance, and rises like a new-born thing Fresh from the realm of spirits. 2nd Guard. Hush! she speaks. Len. I dreamed, and in that visioned agony 'Twas whispered by strange voices, like the deads', I was the mother of this Floribel, And still a wanderer upon man's earth; No, no, I am her ghost, shade of her essence, Thrust into some strange shape of womanhood Until the tomb is open. What are these? Good sir, have you a tear to throw away, A little sigh to spare unto the wind? I've heard that there are hearts yet in the world, Perhaps you have one. 1st Guard. Lady, for your sorrow It aches most deeply. Len. Prithee, look you here. Cold, cold; 'tis all in vain: those lustrous eyes Will never beam again beneath the stars; Darkened for ever; and those wan, dead lips: They'll put her in the earth and let the world, The pitiless bad world, tread o'er her beauty, While I—ye airs of heaven, why will ye feed me? Why, ye officious ministers, bestow The loathed blessing of a cursed existence? There's many a one now leans upon the cheek Of his dead spouse, a-listening for her pulse, And hears no motion but his bursting heart; Give him my life and bid him wipe his eyes. Look here, look here, I've heard them call her flower; oh! had she been The frailest rose that whitens in the blast, Thus bruised and rifled by a ruffian hand, I might have kept her living in my tears A very little while, until I die; And then—now tell me this and I will bless thee, Where thinkest our spirits go? 1st Guard. Madam, I know not; Some say they hang like music in the air, Some that they sleep in flowers of Paradise, Some that they lie ingirt by cloudy curtains, Or 'mong the stars. Len. Oh! not among the stars, For, if she's there, my sight's so dimmed with tears, I ne'er shall find her out, But wander through the sparkling labyrinth Wearied, alone; oh! say not 'mong the stars. Why do ye move her? 1st Guard. We must bear her hence Unto the Duke. Len. What! Is it not enough That she is dead? 1st Guard. No hand shall offer hurt, And in short space we'll bring her back again, Unto your cottage. Len. Thanks! They shall not harm her; Soldier, I will repay this kindness nobly; Hark you; I'm going far off, to Paradise, And if your child, or wife, or brother's there, I'll bring them to you in your dreams some night. Farewell; I will go search about for Comfort, Him, that, enrobed in mouldering cerements, sits At the grey tombstone's head beneath the yew; Men call him Death, but Comfort is his name. [Exeunt. Enter two Citizens. 1st Cit. Well met sir, come you from the trial? 2nd Cit. Ay; In wonder that the stones do not come down To crush that monster of all wickedness, The wretched Hesperus; there he stands, Biting his chains and writhing in his rage Like a mad tiger. 1st Cit. Is he yet condemned? 2nd Cit. Death is the sentence. 1st Cit. See, the criminal And his old father; what a sight of pity. Enter Hesperus guarded, Orlando, Hubert, Lord Ernest, and Mob. Hesp. Well, gaping idiots; have ye stared enough; Have ye yet satisfied your pious minds, By thanking your most bounteous stars ye're not A prodigy like this? Get home and tell Your wives, and put me in your tales and ballads; Get home and live. L. Ern. Oh hush my son, Get some good priest of Charity to draw Tears of repentance from your soul, and wake The sleeping virtue. Hesp. Who's this greybeard driveller? Go, find your wits, old fellow, that bald skull Is full of leaks; hence! look in last night's bowl; Search all your money-bags: don't come abroad Again without them; 'tis amiss. L. Ern. Oh heavens! Is this the son, over whose sleeping smiles Often I bent, and, mingling with my prayers Thanksgivings, blessed the loan of so much virtue. Hesp. That's right; weep on, weep on; for thou art he, Who slew his only child, his first-born child. Orl. Oh look upon his galling agony, These desperate yearnings of paternal love, And try to have an heart. Hesp. You're merry, friend; Troth 'tis a goodly jest: what, dost thou think These limbs, the strength of nature's armoury, That but exist to dare, and dare the things That make the blood of bravery turn pale For very terror, such a minion's work, The offspring of those dribbling veins? Go to, Thou'rt a sad idiot. L. Ern. Oh! hear him not, thou ever-present Justice, And close thy watchful eyelid, thou that weighest Th' allotted scale of crime. Hesp. Come hither, age; I have a whisper for your secrecy; Consider; who am I? L. Ern. Thou wast my son, The pulse of my dead heart, light of my eyes, But now— Hesp. Thy son! I would I'd time to laugh. No, no; attend. The night, that gave me being, There was unearthly glee upon the winds, There were strange gambols played beneath the moon, The madman smiled uncouthly in his sleep, And children shrunk aghast at goblin sights; Then came a tap against the rattling casement, Not the owl's wing, or struggle of the blast; Thy dotardship snored loudly, and meanwhile An incubus begot me. L. Ern. Lead me home, My eyes are dim; I cannot see the way: I fain would sleep. [Exit with some of the Citizens. Hesp. Go, some one, tell his nurse To get him swaddling clothes. Orl. Prodigious wretch! Rebel to man and heaven! On thee shall fall The cureless torture of the soul, the woe Hell nurses for the deepest damned. Hesp. 'Tis pity So much good cursing should be thrown away; Well spit, my reptile! Officers, lead on: Shall I, in bondage, stand to glut the sight Of these poor marvel-dealing things? Away, I'll shut them out; the red death on you all! [Going. Ah! my good fellow, are you of the train That wait upon Olivia? Attend. I'm her servant. Hesp. How fares she? Attend. Very ill; she wastes, Careless of living. Hesp. Tell her, on my love I charge her live; oh heaven, she must not die, There are enough accusers in the tomb. Tell her—Shame, shame, they shall not see me weep. [Exeunt. ACT V. Scene I. A room in Mordred's cottage. The dead Floribel laid upon a couch. Lenora and Boy. Len. Why dost thou weep, thou little churl? Boy. Alas! I need not say. Len. Boy, boy; thou'rt wicked; thou wouldst have me think I have no Floribel, but thou shalt see How I will make her live. It is the morning, And she has risen to tend her favourite flowers, And, wearied with the toil, leans o'er her seat In silent languor. Now I will steal in, Softly: perchance she sleeps. It's plain she hears not, Or she would leap all-smiling to my arms; I wish dear Mordred were awake to see How the sweet girl will start and welcome me, At my first speaking: but I'll wait awhile, And save the pleasure. Ah! thou pretty silence, I know thou'rt thinking what a happy cot 'Twill be when our loved patient is quite well. Yes, you shall take him his first walk; he'll lean Upon that arm, and you shall show the plants New set in the garden, and the grassy path Down to the church. Now I will stand behind her, So,—she must drop her head upon my bosom, As she looks up. Good-morrow to thee, sweet; Now for her gentle cry; she's turning round. No—for she wont seem startled, but pretend To have heard my coming. Why art thou so slow? Sweet little wag, I know thou'rt not asleep. Soft! 'Tis the swiftness of my thought outruns Her proper motions. I've this instant spoken, The air has scarcely yet ta'en up my words; May be she hears not. But I did not speak; 'Twas only thought, or whispered. Child, good-morrow; Yes, she hears that, but will not stir even yet. I'll not be frightened, for she surely hears; Though, if I had not seen her garments move, And caught the tiny echo of her breath, 'Twere dreadful. Speak, I pray thee, Floribel, Speak to thy mother; do but whisper “ay;” Well, well, I will not press her; I am sure She has the welcome news of some good fortune, And hoards the telling till her father comes; Perhaps she's found the fruit he coveted Last night. Ah! she half laughed. I've guessed it then; Come tell me, I'll be secret. Nay, if you mock me, I must be very angry till you speak. Now this is silly; some of those young boys Have dressed the cushions with her clothes in sport. 'Tis very like her. I could make this image Act all her greetings; she shall bow her head, “Good-morrow mother;” and her smiling face Falls on my neck.—Oh, heaven, 'tis she indeed! I know it all—don't tell me. Scene II. The interior of a prison. Hesperus alone. Hesp. Hark! Time's old iron voice already counts The steps unto the after-world, o'er which Sleep in her arms hath carried man to-night; And all it wakes to business or to joy, Save one; and, mingled with its solemn tone, I heard the grating gates of hell expand— Oh! house of agony, I feel thy scorching flames already near. Where shall I 'scape? Is there no hiding place? Spirit, that guidest the sun, look round this ball, And through the windows of deep ocean's vault; Is there no nook just big enough for me? Or, when I'm dead, can I not pass my soul For common air, and shroud me in some cloud? But then the earth will moulder, clouds evanish; So Hell, I must unto thee, darksome vale; For dared I hope, I could not wish, Elysium: There should I meet the frowns of Floribel; My father would be there:—black gulph of anguish, Thou art far better than such paradise. Why did they teach me there is such a place? The pang of misery is there; I know There is a land of bliss, and am not in it; This, this outstings your lashes, torturers; He has no lack of punishment who feels it. Enter Jailor. Oh! speak not for a moment, speak not, sir, I know thine errand well; so tell it not. But let me shut mine eyes, and think a little That I am what I was. Ay, there he sits, My good old sire, with his large eye of love. How well it smiles upon that lovely maid, A beauteous one, indeed; and yet, they say, She died most cruelly. Oh! tell me something, Drive out these dreams. Jail. Prisoner, prepare for death. [Exit. Hesp. Death! Death! What's death? I cannot think. Enter Lenora. Who art thou? Len. Ha! knowest thou not the wretch thou'st made Lenora? Alone I've found thee, villain. Hesp. Not alone; Oh! not alone: the world hath burst its ribs, And let out all the demons in the pit; Thick; thick they throng: I cannot breathe for them; The hounds of Lucifer are feeding on me, Yet I endure; Remorse and Conscience too, Stirring the dying embers of my heart, Which Passion hath burnt out, like midnight gossips Sit idly chattering of the injured dead; But thou'rt the last and worst; I hoped to hide Beneath the turf from thee. Len. Thou shalt not leave me; stand and hear my curse,— Oh such a curse! I learned it from a voice That wandered 'mid the damned: it burns my tongue, Listen, wretch, listen; Thus, thus I curse thee . . . . . . . No I do revoke it, My pardon be upon you for your deeds; Though thou didst stab me through my Floribel, I think thou once didst love her; didst thou not? Hesp. With my whole soul, as now I worship her. Len. Alas! say no; I wish thou'dst break my heart; Now, pr'ythee do; I'll bless thee for't again. Hesp. What! is it stubborn yet? Then thou canst teach me How to bear misery—but I need it not, They've dug my grave. Len. But, while you still are living, What say you to some frolic merriment? There are two grassy mounds beside the church, My husband and my daughter; let us go And sit beside them, and learn silence there; Even with such guests we'll hold our revelry O'er bitter recollections: there's no anguish, No fear, no sorrow, no calamity, In the deathful catalogue of human pains, But we will jest upon't, and laugh and sing: Let pitiful wretches whine for consolation, Thank heaven we despair. Enter Guards. Hesp. See you these men? They bid me to a strange solemnity. Len. Must thou be gone? Hesp. I must, alas! for ever. Live and be blessed, mother of Floribel. [Exit with Guards. Len. Farewell; farewell. They drag him to the scaffold, My son, the husband of my Floribel: They shall not slaughter him upon the block, And to the cursing multitude hold up The blackened features which she loved; they shall not. [Exit. Scene III. An apartment in Orlando's palace. Olivia, Violetta, and Attendants. Oliv. Sing me that strain, my gentle Violet, Which erst we used, in sport and mockery Of grief, beneath the willow shade at eve To chaunt together; 'twill allay my woes. Song, by two voices. First Voice. Who is the baby, that doth lie Beneath the silken canopy Of thy blue eye? Second. It is young Sorrow, laid asleep In the crystal deep. Both. Let us sing his lullaby, Heigho! a sob and a sigh. First Voice. What sound is that, so soft, so clear, Harmonious as a bubbled tear Bursting, we hear? Second. It is young Sorrow, slumber breaking, Suddenly awaking. Both. Let us sing his lullaby, Heigho! a sob and a sigh. Oliv. 'Tis well: you must not weep; 'twill spoil your voices, And I shall need them soon. Viol. For what, Olivia? You were not wont to prize our simple skill Erewhile so highly: what will please you most? What lay of chivalry, or rural sport, Or shepherd love, shall we prepare you next? Oliv. My dirge: I shall not tax your music else. It must be: wherefore weep? Viol. I cannot help it, When you converse so mournfully of death; You must forgive me. Oliv. Death! thou silly girl, There's no such thing; 'tis but a goblin word, Which bad men conjure from their reeking sins To haunt their slumbers; 'tis a life indeed. These bodies are the vile and drossy seeds, Whence, placed again within their kindred earth, Springs Immortality, the glorious plant Branching above the skies. What is there here To shrink from? Though your idle legends tell How cruelly he treats the prostrate world; Yet, unto me, this shadowy potentate Comes soft and soothing as an infant's sleep, And kisses out my being. Violetta, Dost thou regard my wish, perhaps the last? Viol. Oh! madam, can you doubt it? We have lived Together ever since our little feet Were guided on the path, and thence have shared Habits and thoughts. Have I in all that time, That long companionship, e'er thwarted thee? Why dost thou ask me then? Indeed I know not Thy wishes from my own, but to prefer them. Then tell me what you will; if its performance But occupy the portion of a minute, 'Twill be a happy one, for which I thank you. Oliv. Thine hand upon it; I believe thy promise. When I am gone you must not weep for me, But bring your books, your paintings, and your flowers, And sit upon my grassy monument In the dewy twilight, when they say souls come Walking the palpable gross world of man, And I will waft the sweetest odours o'er you; I'll shower down acorn-cups of spicy rain Upon your couch, and twine the boughs above; Then, if you sing, I'll take up Echo's part, And from a far-off bower give back the ends Of some remembered airy melody; Then, if you draw, I'll breathe upon the banks And freshen up the flowers, and send the birds, Stammering their madrigals, across your path; Then, if you read, I'll tune the rivulets, I'll teach the neighbouring shrubs to fan your temples, And drive sad thoughts and fevers from your breast; But, if you sleep, I'll watch your truant sense, And meet it in the fairy land of dreams With my lap full of blessings; 'twill, methinks, Be passing pleasant, so don't weep for me. Viol. I fear, Olivia, I'm a selfish creature, These tears drop not for you, but for myself; 'Tis not that death will have you, but that I Shall be a lone lost thing without your love. Oliv. My love will spread its wings for ever near you; Each gentler, nobler, and diviner thought Will be my prompting. Viol. Well, I'll bear it then, And even persuade myself this intercourse Of disembodied minds is no conjecture, No fiction of romance. The summer sun Will find me on the sod that covers you, Among the blossoms; I'll try not to cry; And when I hear a rustle in the grass, Or the soft leaves come kissing my bent arm, I shall not lay it to the empty air, But think I know thy utterance in the noises That answer me, and see thy rosy fingers Dimpling the brooks. Oliv. Thou wilt be cheerful, then? Viol. Yes, with this hope, That when, some silent, melancholy night, I've sobbed myself to sleep over your picture, Or some memorial of your former kindness, I shall awaken to ethereal music, And find myself a spirit with Olivia. [A bell tolls. Oliv. Whose summons loads the gale with mournful sound? Attend. Dear lady? Oliv. I ask who's dead or who's to die: You need not tell me: I remember now,— It was a thought I wished to keep away. My love, my Hesperus, unto me thou wert The gentlest and the kindest; sudden madness Must have inspired this deed; and why do I, Wife of the dying, tarry in the world? I feel already dissolution's work; A languor creeps through all my torpid veins; Support me, maidens. Viol. Come unto your couch; Sleep will recruit thee. Oliv. Yes; the breathless sleep; Come and pray round me, as I fade away; My life already oozes from my lips, And with that bell's last sound I shall expire. [Exeunt. Scene IV. The place of Execution. Hesperus guarded, Hubert, Orlando, Citizens, &amp;c. Hesp. Now in the scornful silence of your features I see my hated self; my friends, I was The pestilence you think of; but to-night Angelic ministers have been with me, And by the holy communings of conscience Wrought a most blessed change; my soul has wept And lain among the thorns of penitence; I ask, (and you will not refuse the boon To one who cannot crave again) forgiveness For all that in the noontide of my crimes, Against you, even in thought, I have committed. Orl. And we rejoice to grant it; and if prayers, In meek sincerity outpoured, avail, You have them from our hearts. Hesp. Thy sister's soul spake in those words, Orlando; A wretch's blessing for them. I'm as one In some lone watch-tower on the deep, awakened From soothing visions of the home he loves; Trembling he hears the wrathful billows whoop, And feels the little chamber of his life Torn from its vale of clouds, and, as it falls, In his midway to fate, beholds the gleam Of blazing ships, some swallowed by the waves, Some, pregnant with mock thunder, tossed abroad, With mangled carcases, among the winds; And the black sepulchre of ocean, choaked With multitudinous dead; then shrinks from pangs, Unknown but destined. All I know of death Is, that 'twill come. I have seen many die Upon the battle field, and watched their lips At the final breath, pausing in doubt to hear If they were gone. I have marked oftentimes Their pale eyes fading in the last blue twilight; But none could speak the burning agony, None told his feelings. I ne'er dreamed I died, Else might I guess the torture that attends it. But men unhurt have lost their several senses, Grown deaf, and blind, and dumb without a pang, And surely these are members of the soul, And, when they fail, man tastes a partial death: Besides our minds share not corporeal sleep, But go among the past and future, or perhaps Inspire another in some waking world, And there's another death. I will not fear; why do ye linger, guards? I've flung my doubts away; my blood grows wild. Hub. The hour appointed is not yet arrived, Some moments we must wait; I pray you, patience. Enter Lord Ernest in the dress of a peasant, followed by Claudio. Clau. My lord, where dost thou hurry? L. Ern. To Despair; Away! I know thee not. Henceforth I'll live Those bitter days that Providence decrees me, In toil and poverty. Oh son, loved son, I come to give thee my last tear and blessing; Thou wilt not curse the old, sad wretch again? Hesp. (Falling upon the ground and covering himself with the loose earth.) Oh trample me to dust. L. Ern. (Lying down beside him) My own dear child; Ay, we will lie thus sweetly in the grave, (The wind will not awake us, nor the rain,) Thou and thy mother and myself; but I, Alas! I have some tearful years to come, Without a son to weep along with me. Hesp. Father, dear father! And wilt thou pray for me? Oh, no! thou canst not, Thou must forget or hate me. L. Ern. Sirs, have pity; Let him not use me thus. Hesperus, Hesperus, Thou'rt going to thy mother; tell her, son, My heart will soon be broken; so prepare To have me with you. Bless thee, boy, good night. [Exit. Hesp. My father, heaven will curse thee if I bless; But I shall die the better for this meeting. [Kneeling. Oh, Floribel! fair martyr of my fury, Oh, thou blessed saint! look down and see thy vengeance, And, if thy injured nature still can pity, Whisper some comfort to my soul. 'Tis done; I feel an airy kiss upon my cheek; It is her breath; she hears me; she descends; Her spirit is around me. Now I'll die. Enter Lenora. Len. Where's Hesperus? Not gone? Speak to me loud, I hear not for the beating of my heart. We're not both dead? Say thou hast 'scaped the headsman, Nor felt the severing steel fall through thy neck. Hesp. I stay one moment for the signal here, The next I am no more. Len. Then we have conquered. Friend, leave us: I would speak a private word Unto thy prisoner. Look upon these flowers; They grew upon the grave of Floribel, And, when I pulled them, through their tendrils blew A sweet soft music, like an angel's voice. Ah! there's her eye's dear blue; the blushing down Of her ripe cheek in yonder rose; and there In that pale bud, the blossom of her brow, Her pitiful round tear; here are all colours That bloomed the fairest in her heavenly face; Is't not her breath? Hesp. (smelling them.) It falls upon my soul Like an unearthly sense. Len. And so it should, For it is Death thou'st quaffed: I steeped the plants in a magician's potion, More deadly than the scum of Pluto's pool, Or the infernal brewage that goes round From lip to lip at wizards' mysteries; One drop of it, poured in a city conduit, Would ravage wider than a year of plague; It brings death swifter than the lightning shaft.

Down with your fiery fangs!—I'm not dead yet. [Dies. THE END.</field>
