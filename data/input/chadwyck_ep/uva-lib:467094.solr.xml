      <field name="fulltext">Amico, io vivendo cercava conforto Nel monte Parnasso: Tu, meglio consigliato, cercalo Nel Calvario. Chiabrera's Epitaph at Savona.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. Blame not my verse if echoes of church bells With every change of thought or dream are twining, Fetching a murmuring sameness from the fells, And lakes, and rivers with their inland shining. And marvel not in these loose drifting times If anchored spirits in their blythest motion Dip to their anchors veiled within the ocean, Catching too staid a measure for their rhymes. An Age comes on, which came three times of old, The end of the fourth, the beginning of the thirteenth, and the end of the sixteenth Centuries. When the enfeebled nations shall stand still To be by Christian science shaped at will; And the fresh Church, rejecting heathen mould, Shall draw her types from Europe's middle night, Well-pleased if such good darkness be her light. F. W. F. PRELUDE TO THE STYRIAN LAKE. A single day! A single nook of earth! O how the heart doth magnify all things Embraced within her soft and shadowy rings! What a huge niche to shrine a single mirth, A joy obscure as is the Styrian lake, Vague as the odorous breath of pinewood brake!— Priest of a sylvan chapel, I would call The world-worn pilgrim hither to take breath, Joining in this my weekday ritual, Of nature mixed and our most holy Faith. If it be worth no more, at least it gives Sweet proof how full the green earth is of glee: My days are all like this; so let it be A sample of the life a poet lives. F. W. F. THE ANNUNCIATION OF OUR BLESSED LADY. I.THE STYRIAN LAKE. 1.THE LAKE. Where the Styrian mountains rise Close to Mariazell, lies Buried in a pinewood brake A most beautiful green lake. Lizard's back is not so green As its soft and tremulous sheen; Hermit's home on Athos' hill Cannot be a place more still. Blissful Covert! there is not Like that Styrian lake a spot That I know by land or sea, Whose unsleeping memory Works so potently in me. 'Tis good to have a nook of earth To be with us in our mirth, And to set a haunt apart To be household in the heart, A local shrine, whence gentle sorrow Hope and soothing thought may borrow; And which may be every hour In the light, or shade, or shower, Or the stillness, or the wind, Or the sunset, as the mind Would the light within should vary, A true mental sanctuary. What may hallow grief, but thought And soft feeling closely wrought? For the heart, which in its pain Can the outer world disdain, And the kind earth which we tread, How shall it be comforted? And that pensive being, mirth, If it be untied from earth, Is a wanton, dreamy thing, Like a pine-tree's murmuring. Styria is a wondrous land, Special work of beauty's hand, Where amidst the tranquil pines Many a green lake meekly shines, And upon its bosom glasses All the slumberous dark masses From the mighty firwoods thrown, And white steep, and sunny cone. For the forest murmurings, And for lawnlike openings Where in shady belts of trees Nestle the lone villages, For sweet brooks and ruined halls And romantic waterfalls, And a colouring so bright That the land is green by night, And for echoes waking round When the convent bell shall sound, For unwonted woodland grace Styria is a wondrous place: And it is the nook of earth That is with me in my mirth, A real Eden, whence I borrow Food for song and calm for sorrow. Most I love that placid lake, Buried in the pinewood brake. There the little pool is laid Quiet in the lisping shade, Mountain water in a cup To the blue skies looking up, With the bubbles brightly beading All the gleamy surface, speeding Up like silver fish where'er Earthy springs mount to the air. There the little pool was laid Quiet in the pinewood shade, When the Roman hosts were come To these woods of Noricum. Emperors rose and tribunes fell, Earth was governed ill or well; There was famine, there was war, And sedition's dreadful jar, And man's lot became so dreary That the earth grew old and weary. Were it not for her free mirth Men would make a slave of earth. But this way there came no breath Of calamity or death. They pierced not through the pinewood brake To the little Styrian lake. All the changes which it saw Were by the harmonious law And the sweetly pleading reasons Of the four and fair-tongued seasons. Pearly dawn and hazy noon, And the yellow-orbèd moon, And the purple midnight, came Through those very years the same. The lake had all its own free will, So it was translucent still; For the summer day was fair, When the white-banked clouds were there, And the bright moths in the air; And the thunder cleared away For the evening's slanting ray, And the thrushes in the rain Sang with all their might and main To the young ones in their home: What recked they of mighty Rome? Not a moth or bird did shine Brighter there for Constantine. Blessed earth! O blessed lake! Shut within thy pinewood brake, Angels saw thee in thy glee, Of the Roman Empire free! Then romantic days came on: Nature still as calmly shone On the fragrant pinewood shade Where the Styrian lake was laid. Earl with belt and knight with spur, These made no unwonted stir In the green and glossy deep, Nor woke the echoes from the steep. And if ever highborn maid To the river did unlade Her sad heart of freight of love, When could songs hard fortune move? Yet the stream forgot the wail Ere it passed the sunken vale, Where the little tremulous lake Sparkles in the hollow brake. And the merry hunting-horn, Speaking in the cold white morn, Bore not on its ringing breath Tidings of the newborn Faith. Yet methinks 'twere not unmeet To believe a trouble sweet, Like a new soul, found its road Into that retired abode, Somewhat of a murmuring Through the pine-boughs vibrating, When they caught the harmless swell Of the earliest convent bell. If sound have one human birth Blending wholly with the earth, Rising, growing, near of far, With no other sound at war, Which can sorrow or rejoice Like a natural earthborn voice, Natural as the breezes blowing, Pastoral as the oxen lowing, 'Tis the undulating swell Of the woodland abbey bell. 2.THE LEGEND. So eleven ages fled Since the Lord rose from the dead, Maker of this little lake, Moth and bird and pinewood brake, To redeem the sons of earth And give to them a better birth, Not without the element From the earth's own bosom sent, Thus to heighten and to bless Our old mother's loveliness, From her surface to unweave All the ravelled web which Eve, Name her with a tender thought! Hath o'er field and forest wrought, To enrich her with a dower Of true sacramental power. Not without her blameless gifts Jesus her lost children lifts To a nature all divine, Better, dearest earth! than thine. So eleven ages passed, While the pines their shadow cast, Making summer noonday cool By the green sequestered pool. Hither for the love of Mary Came a gentle Missionary, With an image of black wood From an ancient limetree hewed, Shaped for her, the Mother mild, Blessed Mary with her Child. With the Image to the dell Came the gift of miracle, Shrined within a sylvan Cell. Far away mid cultured bowers Rose St. Lambert's convent towers, The martyred Saint, who bravely stood Against King Pepin; and his blood, By the lewd Alpais slain, Ran in Liege street like rain. Out from yon Cistercian home This kind-mannered Monk hath come With St. Mary and her Child So to hallow the green wild. Not the moon when she o'ertops Lofty Seeberg's ragged copse, Clearing all the dusky pine, In the starry sky to shine, Hunting with her arrowy beam Open spots in Salza's stream, Where at times it may emerge Scarce beyond the forest's verge, Not the stealthy breath of spring Up the woodlands murmuring, Drawing after it a veil Of thin green across the dale, Like an Angel's robe behind, Still, or stirred by odorous wind: Not so welcome, moon or spring, For the quiet gifts they bring; Advents though they be of bliss, They bear not a boon like this, Blessed Mary and her Son Deep into the woodlands gone, One poor monk, a beadsman lowly, With gilt vessels rude but holy, And a power of miracle Shed into the whispering dell, Lodged within and screened apart In the forest's dusky heart. Now amid the woodmen nigh Marriage is a blissful tie, And around the infant's birth Is a light of Christian mirth, And the monk can breathe a breath On the anxious face of death. Life is drawn within a ring Of most peaceful hallowing. To the Mother and the Maid These rude men their breasts unlade, Seeking to her Son for aid. Like the valley's evening mist By the pensive sunset kissed, Charities and virtues rise With all household sanctities, While meek hymns and praises flow From the hermitage below; And the little bell is rung When the blessed Mass is sung, All, a blameless incense, given From the pinewoods into Heaven, From the shaggy Styrian dell Of St. Mary of the Cell. Thou wert not unstirred, dear lake! Though perchance thou didst not wake From the sleep wherein the wind Doth thy green depths seem to bind, Sighing sweetly, softly, sadly, Sighing sometimes almost gladly, As the pinetree only sighs, Maker of earth's elegies: Thou wert not unstirred that day, When upon thy marge at play First a Christian child was seen, White as snowwreath on a green, Pure as nature's self, and bright With a more abounding light. Let the gentle memory Of the plain monk honoured be, He who for the love of Mary Hither came a missionary, A devout and nameless being To the Styrian forests fleeing, To baptize the woodmen rude In this shady solitude, And to add a better mirth To the glory of the earth. Holy monk! thy good deeds shine Above peer or palatine, Gleaming through the crowded past With a radiance calm and chaste, Like a steady, pensive star, By itself, and brighter far Than the sparkling ruddy ring Round the name of some old king. Yet thy quiet name is gone In the shadow of some throne, Lost amid the jewelled throng, All embalmed in unwise song. Let the pageant pass away, There is thy domestic ray; There art thou—a lily-flower In a most unthought-of bower. Or a very fragrant tree, Which we smell but cannot see, Buried in the tangled wood, Scenting all the neighbourhood. Thou, a man of simple ways, Never could'st have joyless days; Thou, a man of simple wants, Must have loved the sylvan haunts. Ever to thy spirit stealing With a touch of heavenly feeling. Oft I doubt not by this lake, Forcing through the pinewood brake, Thou didst spend the twilight dim, Chanting some rough latin hymn, Hallowing the evening air With devout half-spoken prayer. Mists upon the mighty hills And the alder-belted rills, Chirping bird and lowly flower, And the rainbow in the shower, And the air when it receives Incense from the withered leaves, And the pinetrees in the sun, And the green lake at the noon Imaging the empty moon, Whose unfreighted orb is white For the lack of yellow light;— Like the Church whose Lord must go Ere she can reflect the glow Of His glory, deep and vast, In her bridal bosom cast, So the moon all day must bide For an evening Whitsuntide:— All this common tranquil round, This sweet ring of sight and sound, Did of old belong to thee, And to-day belongs to me; And it soothed thy wrinkled brow And thy heart thou knew'st not how. Ah kind-mannered monk! I seem, As in some strong-featured dream, To come nigh and spend an hour With thee in this Styrian bower; So much hath the blissful thought Of thy doings in me wrought. Centuries are yielding things: Unity of spirit brings Land to land, and year to year, And old generations near. Thus I walk o'er this green land Through the forests hand in hand With the simple Missionary, Who for love of Mother Mary Was content apart to dwell With her Image in his cell. And thus for full a hundred years Simple joys and simple fears Compassed some Cistercian brother, Beadsman to the blessed Mother; Till it chanced that far away In the drear Moravia, Margrave Henry dreamed a dream, Where the Mother-Maid did seem To heal him of his sore disease In a cell amid green trees, And the visionary lines, Pictured Styria's rocks and pines, And the Margrave saw the lake, And the open pinewood brake. So he came with trusting soul, And St. Mary made him whole. Costly Church with tower and bell Rises in the sylvan dell, Arching o'er the antique cell. Now in long and gorgeous line Emperors crowd unto the shrine, Peers and ladies and proud kings Kneel there with their offerings; Silken banners, bright and brave, Through the dusky pinewoods wave, And the peasants of far lands Come with wild flowers in their hands,— All come here to Mary's haunt With a sorrow or a want. Yet I ween the shaggy dell Witnessed worthier miracle, When the woodmen of the place Were transformed by inward grace; And from their wild manners grew Flowers that feed on heavenly dew; And soft thoughts and gentle ways Could beguile their rugged days. Love of Mary was to them As the very outer hem Of the Saviour's priestly vest, Which they timorously pressed, And whereby a simple soul Might for faith's sake be made whole. 3.CHURCH MATINS. Oh how beautiful was dawn On the Styrian mountain lawn, When the lights and shadows lay Where the night strove with the day! From my window did I look Upon Salza's glimmering brook, And the valley dark and deep, And the ponderous woods asleep; And I saw the little lake Like a black spot in the brake. And the silver crescent moon Of the greenwood month of June, Hanging o'er a mountain top Seemed her downward course to stop, And to look around in wonder At the landscape brightening under. In the sky there was a light Which was not a birth of night, A stealthy streak, and pearly pale, Like a white transparent veil; And there came a chilly breeze, Like the freshness of the seas, As though hills and woods on high Now were breathing heavily; And among the woodlands wide Here and there a wild bird cried. Where the dewy alders grow I could hear the oxen low; But the echo that did follow Was a sound more dead and hollow Than the leaping voice that fills Daylight skies and daylight hills. On the pastures was a light Which was neither day nor night, And the dusky frowning wood Still in moonlight shadows stood. But a mist o'er Salza's bed Hovered like a gossamer thread; And I saw the glorious scene Every moment grow more green,— Day encroaching with sweet light On the fairy-land of night. I remember well that dawn On the Styrian mountain lawn. Blessed be the God who made Sun and moon, and light and shade, Balmy wind and pearly shower, Forest tree and meadow flower, And the heart to feel and love All the joys that round us move! Blessed be the Angels bright, Ordering the pomp aright, Ministrants of winds and showers, Ruddy clouds and sunset hours, With fair robe and busy wing The mute figures marshalling, Like a ceremonial thing! Blessed be the Cross that draws From the earth by dreadest laws Sparkling streams that cleanse and shine, Making little babes divine, And the grape's red blood, and bread Laid upon the Altar dread; Symbols, more than symbols, urns Where a Heavenly Presence burns, Veils that hide from loving eyes Jesus in His strange disguise, Making earth to be all rife With a supernatural life. Sweet into the morning dim Rose the happy pilgrim's hymn, As he caught from distant height, In the grey uncertain light, The early flush of summer morning Upon Mariazell dawning. From the Salza's shady bed, From the mountain's rocky head, From the earthy path that shines Down the steep and through the pines, From the meadow-lands below Like a very stream doth flow The sweet song and plaintive greeting Of the weary pilgrims meeting; “All hail in thy sylvan tent, “Mary, fairest Ornament!” Mother Mary! 'tis a thing Soothing as the breath of spring, In the quiet time to hear This wild region far and near With the very accents swell Of the blessed Gabriel. 'Tis a wonder and a grace In this uncouth pinewood place, Mid white rocks and gloomy trees And old Noric fastnesses, To look forth and calmly listen, While above the pale stars glisten; And to hear the grateful song Of the gentile pilgrim-throng, The old angelic greeting, given To the Virgin Queen of Heaven. What are ages, what is time To a ritual thus sublime? How shall distance or decay Make or mar eternal day? For a heavenly word once spoken Is an everlasting token, Still by time or space unbroken; And through weary centuries, Quivering on the very breeze, Word divine and angel breath Hover to the ear of faith, Finding souls which they may win, And meek hearts to enter in. I see Mary rapture-bound, And the lily-flowers around, And the smooth and spotless bed, And the Angel overhead, And the open casement where Blows the fresh and virgin air, And Our Lady, mute and pale, Listening to the strange “All Hail.” And I hear—years hinder not— Angel accents on the spot; Hark! the Styrian vale is ringing With the gentile pilgrims singing. Breaking on the quiet dell Slowly swings the heavy bell, And the organ breathes a sound Into all the pine woods round. What a trouble of delight There hath been the livelong night! Mariazell! thou hast seen Sleepers few this night, I ween. One by one the pilgrims throng, Coming in with plaintive song; And in many a gaudy shed Beads and Crosses are outspread. Like the stars that one by one Come to shine when day is done, Still they flock with merry din, From the valley of the Inn, From the Ennsland green and deep, And the rough Carinthian steep, From the two lakes of the Save, And the blythe rich banks of Drave, And the Mur's rock-shadowed floods, That shy hunter of the woods, From the low Dalmatian sea, And the sea-like Hungary, And where Danube's waters pass By Belgrade through the morass, From Bavaria's sandy dells, And the smooth Bohemian fells, From Würzburg and from Ratisbon, Linz and Passau they have gone; And St. John of Prague hath sent Worshippers to Mary's tent, Where she waits her serfs to bless In the Styrian wilderness. Still they pass unheeded by; From the village every eye Goes with eager anxious look Up the Salza's tumbling brook: No white banners yet have showed On the great Vienna road; In the pauses of the ringing They can hear no far-off singing, And the signal hath not fired, And the youthful groups are tired. Yet 'twas whispered overnight They'd leave Annaberg ere light. Pomp of crowds and festal noise Are not numbered in my joys; So I sought the little lake And the lonely pinewood brake. The sweet day was clouded over, And the thunder seemed to hover O'er the dark, unruffled flood, And the silent neighbourhood. Scarce a creature seemed to stir In that wilderness of fir. Not a note of singing bird In the tangled dell was heard: And the forest lands did wear A dark robe of lurid air. On the mountains there did press A grim dullhearted silentness. Peace was round me, and a calm, Yet without the soothing balm Shed on us by earth and sea In their true tranquillity. Swarms of moths from out the brake Fluttered all across the lake, And the leaping fishes made Dreary splashes in the shade, Where an ancient pinetree throws O'er the pool its drooping boughs. Where the marge was strewn all over With a tapestry of clover, The dull skies appeared to lower On the mute and blameless flower; All the soft and pleasant brightness Like a breath passed from its whiteness; As the soul of man whose beauty Fades, when the timid sense of duty Passes forth with hasty wing, Like a wronged and banished thing. From the ragged trees on high, From the mirky, swaying sky, From the summit, white and tall, With its black pine coronal, A darksome power of gloom did fall, Weighing on the little lake, Hushing all the pinewood brake, Tarnishing each radiant sight, Sheathing all the gay green light, Deadening every summer sound, To a drowsy tingling bound. Beauty strove, and strove again, And the summer strove in vain. Over lake and pines and all Was a very funeral pall. Can it be a curse doth lurk In the heart of earth at work? Yet in that translucent deep Furtive beauty seems to creep, Like a stealthy sunbeam winding Through the ocean-depths, and finding Creatures in them, meek and bright, Whom to gladden with its light. Thus doth earth for ever bless True hearts with her loveliness, Stealing to them in the storm With some fair and happy form, Uttering still some joyous sound In a bleak and joyless ground, Planting moss and brilliant grass In the heart of a morass. Light within the lake doth move When there is no light above, And the sunshine which should glow In the blue skies, works below, As far down as eye can follow In the green transparent hollow, Streaking it with silvery shoot, As though sunbeams could take root In the lake with lawless mirth, And so shine upwards to the earth. Thou alone, dear earth! of all Art a blameless prodigal! When the heaven above is dull, And thy yearning heart is full Of a wish to solace one Who into thy fields hath gone To take comfort from thy gladness Or courage from thy patient sadness,— When the cheerless heaven above Will not aid thee in thy love, Thou some inner light canst win As though from a heaven within. Could I think that still at work The primal curse in thee did lurk? Shall a thought of curse come night, When I hear that Christian cry? Hark! at last the joyous song Of Vienna's pilgrim throng: “All hail in thy sylvan tent, Mary, fairest Ornament!” Tarries the procession still? See! it winds along the hill, Like a snake of green and gold In the sunshine all unrolled, Or coiling round a mossy tree, Fearful and yet fair to see. Thus the bright and bending throng Slowly draws itself along, Swayed by modulating song. Mitred prelates at its head Upon flowers and sweet flags tread. Gifts from kings of foreign lands, Banners worked by royal hands, And a hundred shining things, Peer's or peasant's offerings, Move along the uneven ground, While the distant thunders sound. 'Ere I reached them I could hear, Filling all the forest near, “Mariazell! schönste Zier!”— Plaintive burden, that will quiver In my spell-bound ear for ever. My dear land! I thought of thee; And I thought how scantily, In what thrifty rivulets, Faith's weak tide among us sets. And I looked with tearful eyes, With an envious surprise, Upon that huge wave that passed, On the Styrian highlands cast With a mighty, sea-like fall From the Austrian capital. O'er twelve hundred kneelers there Hangs a veil of odorous air, Rising up in thin blue spires From the swinging censer-fires. And through all the gloomy pile, Like a river down each aisle, With a strong and heavy flowing Are the pealing organs blowing; And the banners rich and brave On the current lightly wave, Like the willow bough that quivers On the bosom of the rivers. While the mighty hymns were swelling I passed from out the sacred dwelling, With full heart and burning thought; So much had the ritual wrought, That I scarcely could control The strong impulse of my soul To fall down and weep outright At the great and solemn sight. When from that full house of prayer I passed into the open air, Ah! did ever sweet surprise From old objects so arise With a strange, bewildering power, As in that most thrilling hour? In the western porch I stood Amid mountain wastes and wood, And the hollow tolling thunder, And the misty valleys under, Cloud-strewn forests with stray gleams, And the alder-belted streams, In the rain the pinewoods singing, With a rustling whisper ringing,— Nature filling all the senses With her blameless influences. For the rocky foaming floods And the wet and dripping woods Fresher and more fragrant are Than the incense-loaded air. Mid this glory I am free, Mother-Maid! to think of thee, And with fervent faith to trace, In this dusky sylvan place, Footprints of true miracle Wrought within the savage dell, And the work, blest Mother Mary! Of thine ancient missionary. When the crowd have left the shrine, Then the season shall be mine; Then shall silent Aves swell In a heart that loves thee well, A heart that owes its life to thee, A slave whom Mary hath set free. I cannot pray amidst a crowd, Nor with organs pealing loud, Nor with chains upon my sense From ritual magnificence. Ever fair forms like tyrants bind With spells the currents of my mind. Sweet sights and sounds my spirit fill, And ritual beauty leads me still A passive victim at its will. The creature of all outward shows, My heart into the pageant throws Its ardent self, and dreamily Floats out as on a sunny sea. When the Church with functions bright Wraps calmer spirits in delight, I am rather proud of God, Than humbly at His footstool bowed; And mid the beautiful display I feel and love but cannot pray. I would fain be lone with God, Else are all my thoughts abroad. Quiet altars, Jesus there, Mary's image meek and fair, Silent whispering twilight round,— These make consecrated ground! Better still with holy poor Scattered on the wide church-floor. With the tinkling beads they tell, And whispers scarcely audible. Shame on myself! upon my breast So lightly doth God's presence rest, So little inward turned my soul, So much beneath the eye's controul, That holy pomp and pageant rare Only make poetry spoil prayer. 4.MARGARET'S PILGRIMAGE. Now why weep ye by the shrine, Ye two maidens? Wherefore twine Roses red and sprigs of pine, With a busy absent air, Round the pilgrim-staffs ye bear? From Vienna with high heart Ye set forward to take part In the pilgrimage of grace To St. Mary's sylvan place,— Three fair sisters, loveliest three In the pilgrim company. See! encased in many a gem Mary with her diadem, And, sweet thought! the Mother mild Lifts on high her holy Child: As the pensive artist thought So hath he the limewood wrought. Why stand ye thus sorrow-bound, While the train is kneeling round? And the little Margaret too, With her eyes of merry blue, Wherefore is she not with you? And the staff she was so long In selecting from the throng In the Graben, weeks ago 'Ere the flowers began to blow, And then took it to be blessed At Saint Stephen's by the priest,— Hath it failed her, faint and weary, In some Styrian pinewood dreary? Ah! she felt the dogstar rage, And she fain her thirst would swage— It was her first pilgrimage— At a cold and brilliant spring By the wayside murmuring. Ah sweet child! bright, happy flower! She was broken from that hour. They have left her on the steep Of green Annaberg asleep. With crossed hands upon her breast Her choice staff is lightly pressed. Margaret will awake no more, Save upon a calmer shore. Oh what can the sisters say To the couple far away? What will the old burgher do, Since those eyes of merry blue, The truest sunlight of his home, Never, never more can come? See! they sing not, but they gaze Deep into the jewelled blaze, And the thought within them swells,— Mary hath worked miracles! And they weep and gaze alway, As though they were fain to say, “Mother Mary, couldst thou make Gretchen from her sleep awake?” Thus often fares it upon earth With a long-expected mirth: And when hope is strained too much, Lo! it shivers at the touch. Even from a holy rite There may fade the cheering light, When for long its single thought Deep within the heart hath wrought. This will sometimes quell the ray Even of an Easter Day. Deem not thou no grace is there, Though the rite seem cold and bare, Though it be a weary thing, A dull, and formal offering. It may lodge a light within, Wrestling with the shades of sin, And like frankincense may be To think of in our memory. When the gay procession passed I knew not what sad cloud was cast On these sisters, sorrow-laden, By the death of that fair maiden. When it drew itself along, As one creature, bright and strong, All instinct with life and song, Like a child I did not think That each bending joint and link Of the sinuous pageant could Be real hearts of flesh and blood, Fountains of true hopes and fears, With ebb and flow of smiles and tears, Each a separate orb that moves In a sphere of pains and loves. To mine eye it did but seem As a very fluent dream, And it filled me with a sense Of joy, and not of reverence. Ah! to many this great world Is a pageant thus unfurled, Banners waving in the air, Catching sunlight here and there, O'er uneven places swaying, Or in quiet woods delaying, Everywhere fresh shapes displaying, As the clouds their forms unbind To new figures in the wind; And aye man's voiceful destinies, Like the surge of meeting seas, Are to them but some wild song Breathing from the gilded throng. Thus do idle poets stand Lonely on the tide-ribbed sand, Watching the bright waters roll As a beauty without soul, Knowing nothing of the worth Of a human woe or mirth, Or of that true dignity Which in love and sorrow lie. And the books they write are all But a mute processional, Lifeless rubrics, canons dull Of the bright and beautiful, Formal wisdom, without stir Of passion-tempered character, Or imperial instincts meeting, Or a hot heart in it beating. But the masters of true song, Who would sway the various throng, Must in the procession walk, To their fellow-pilgrims talk, Weep or smile on every thing With a kindly murmuring, And that murmur so shall be An immortal melody. Sisters twain! though now ye sorrow, Ye shall have a calmer morrow; Mariazell shall become In long years a placid home For remembrances, and tears Which spring not out of pains or fears; And this pilgrimage that seems Broken up like baffled dreams, Then shall be a very haunt For your spirits when they want Of soft feeling deep to drink: It shall be a joy to think How the merry Margaret sleeps Mid the Styrian pinewood steeps, Safe with childhood's sinless charms In her Mother Mary's arms. 5.EARTH'S VESPERS. Once more went I to the lake, Buried in the pinewood brake. Through the parting clouds the light Of the afternoon was bright. Beautiful and gay and green On my pathway was the scene,— Gorges full of writhing mist By the silver sunbeams kissed, And the mountains all displayed In a marvellous light and shade. Close before us there was one, Clear and tranquil in the sun, And another on whose breast Clambering mist-wreaths paused to rest, And a third along whose side Snowy cloudbanks seemed to ride, And like a belt to rock and shine In a long and level line: And one there was, veiled all over With thin mists which seemed to hover On the mountain-top, and throw Silky threads from bough to bough; 'Twas lighted up and very fair, And transparent as the air, And within it rose the hill Clothed with sunlight, green and still. And the booming of the bells And the hymn that came in swells Mingled kindly with the mirth Of the jubilant old earth. In the lake and in the heaven Gloom and beauty now had striven; Changed were all things on the shore, For the strife at length was o'er. Mists in serpentine array Coiled upon the treetops lay; Truthful symbols did they seem Of darkness giving way to gleam, Drawing off in that sweet hour The outskirts of his vanquished power. Beauty on the hills was standing, In the very lake expanding With a pure and sparkling green; And the savage pinewood scene Did the afternoon embrace With a calm and softening grace. Stillness was in all her veins, Earth's thanksgiving after rains, Tuneful as the stormy praise Of wild woods on windy days, Or the benedicite Of the angry purple sea. Not a single sound was heard, Save the voice of one shy bird, And the woodman's axe on high, And the drowsy sheepbell nigh. There was not a fall of wind From the clover to unbind Odors that lay fettered there, And to shed them on the air. Ruddy-armoured perch did press To the margin motionless. And the summer afternoon, Holding court that day of June, Throned herself with lustre mild On the blissful Styrian wild. O how often have I known Quiet thought herself enthrone, After tempests, on my mind Without any breathing wind Of sweet language, which could bind In the bonds and links of song All the glorious regal throng, Kindled fancy's courtier crowd, Which came o'er me like a cloud: Times of quiet thought they are, Like this very bright mute air, Filling as a soul the lake And the odorous pinewood brake, With the calm and speechless scene Passive in the sunny green. They are fancy's afternoons, Shadows of her leafy Junes, Shedding, where the heart is calm, New power in the quiet balm. Though he fret at fruitless hours Spent in rapture's voiceless bowers, Yet the poet oft must bless His passive spirit's silentness, As the future salient spring Of true minstrel murmuring. Song is an exile from above, Like a wanderer in love, Falling both by land and sea Into strangest company, Ruling, wheresoever thrown, With a sweet will of its own. Fancy, like the earth, hath dew, Keeping green the spirit's hue, Falls of moisture which renew Hearts that falter and grow weary From the sense that life is dreary,— With such freshness that the glory Of our thoughts is never hoary. There are sabbaths in the mind, Which in deepest quiet bind Love and passion and the world With its glowing landscapes furled, When the song of vernal bird Like a common sound is heard, When the sun and wind and shower And the rainbows have no power, And the forest and the lake Can no inward echo wake. Memories of smiles and tears Treasured up in other years, Sorrow suffered, actions done, Self-restraints by patience won, Rights of grief and rights of love, Things which once the soul could move With a deeper ebb and flow Than the freeborn occeans know, Now are dull and nerveless things, Like a forest's murmurings Falling on the unpleased ear Of a listless traveller. And from all things there hath passed Powers they once might have to cast Shadows, from whose tender gloom We might free, as from a womb, Truths that shall outlive the tomb. Yet shall true-born poet deem Mental sabbaths but a dream, Languor, and a falling back Of the weary soul for lack Of high hope and strength of wing In such thin air hovering? Shall he call such quiet time Faintings after moods sublime, As though rapture's light could scathe Spirits, like a fit of wrath? Mystery and loveliness Gender no such wild excess; Mirth and beauty lay not waste Flowery paths where they have passed. In such times of inward sinking Fancy may perchance be drinking Waters in some holier spirit, Out of earth, in Heaven, or near it. True it is that a sweet spring Cannot be a self-born thing; It must have a leafy place Or a mountain's rocky face. Its beginning and its going, And the surety of its flowing Not a single, rainy day, Nor at seasons, but alway,— These depend on other things, The green covert whence it springs, And the weeping clouds of heaven Out of which the rain is given, And the ponderous old hills, The treasuries of crystal rills. So the spirit of sweet song Not entirely doth belong Unto him who hath been bidden To let it flow through him unchidden, And to keep its fountain hidden. How should he know all the causes Of its gushes and its pauses, How it visits the well-head Whence it is replenishèd, What it hears, or what it sees, How it hath its increases? Where and whensoe'er it goes, This one thing the poet knows, That the spirit, wake or sleeping, Is not now beneath his keeping. For, if it should leave him not, Whence are its fresh pulses got? After all this seeming dulness, Whence the beam, the burst, the fulness,— When the dark and bright of life, Involutions of its strife, And the duties complicate Of this heavy mortal state, And the gold and purple maze Which the past is, to our gaze Looking into other days, And the passions which have rent Worse than warring element, Earth's fair surface where we dwell,— All within the spirit swell, And burst from us loud and strong, Claiming utterance in song. Whence except from out of heaven Are the moulds of greatness given, And the beautiful creations, And the song-like visitations Of high thoughts, wherewith we borrow, Grandeur out of love and sorrow, When the weight of men's distresses On our solemn spirit presses, With a sound in its recesses, When our fellow-mortals call, And we own a kindred thrall In responses musical, When the mystery of things From our tortured spirit wrings Those loud wails of melody, As from eagles in the sky? Whence the fragrant under-growth, Which is springing nothing loth All around us every hour With fresh moss and modest flower, In our fancy's stillest bower, And those lowlier sweetnesses Borne to us on every breeze? After dulness what a thing Is our heart's awakening, When a scattering of dew Unawares makes all things new, As a bunch of cold wet flowers On our brow in feverish hours! Like an unimprisoned boy, Heaviness encounters joy In the face of an old mountain, In the splash of an old fountain, In the sun and wind and rain, Like things lost and found again; Till we own we never know Common blooms that round us blow, Common treasures strewn about us, Close at hand, and scarce without us. Whence are all these wakenings given, If it be not out of heaven? That the might in poet's breast Wholly in himself doth rest, Wholly from himself doth come, As though he could be the home Of the beautiful bright throng He but weaveth into song— Were a creed to disenchant Music's best and holiest haunt, And to leave on land or sea Not a home for minstrelsy. Beauty is a thing that grows, Like love or grief; and who knows If in dulness and in calm Fancy does not gather balm In far fields that bud and swell With spiritual asphodel? O how beautiful is quiet After fancy hath run riot, Waking love and waking mirth Over all the sleepy earth! O how beautiful to look On kind eyes, as on a book, Reading love that hath been beaming All the while our hearts were teeming With unearthly thoughts and visions, Floating in with sweet collisions! And how beautiful a thing Is our dull life's welcoming, When we learn, while we were ranging, That household earth hath not been changing, And that houses, trees, and faces, Are not wildly shifting places, That there are domestic blisses, Which the studious spirit misses, Still a common human heart, Though we were awhile apart! O there is a gracious fulness In this very seeming dulness, When the littleness of life Is more welcome than its strife, Or we in wise moods confess That strife is but a littleness! There is not a choicer bower Than the spirit, in the hour When peace cometh after power; And what hath the earth of beauty Like the calms that follow duty? This hath been a day of joy Much too simple for alloy, One pure day that well may shine, Like stars amid the twilight pine. Now behold! the tranquil power Of the summer-evening hour Is enthroned upon the spot; And the pageant cometh not With the gauzy purple veil Of the English twilight pale, But winds o'er all the forest scene With a light of faint blue green, To a thousand pinetops yielding Somewhat almost of a gilding. There is meaning in the face Of the lake and woodland place. Something heavenly there must be In such deep tranquillity. With meet prayer and gratitude I went from out the solitude; And to Mariazell wending, Up the pine-clad steep ascending, I beheld the dark clouds drooping, Once more to the mountains stooping. Yet along the ridges dim Lay a luminous gold rim, Such as makes me think the while That beyond in brightest smile Lies a very radiant shore I have visited before, In my boyhood, or in gleams Shed on my far-travelled dreams. The one woodless mountain too Was of brilliant golden hue, And its precipices hoary Touched with sunset's mellow glory. From a hollow white-mouthed cave Rose a symbol, calm and grave,— A broken rainbow—whose bright end In the cavern did descend, With mute stationary mirth, Like a very growth of earth. The dark clouds now a moment hover— They descend—the pomp is over! For the day's exceeding beauty There must be returns of duty, And to Christ who thus hath given Sights and sounds in earth and heaven, We must answer at the last For the pageantry now past. Hark! how plaintively they sing;— Never was on natural thing A more touching commentary Than the pilgrim's Ave Mary! II. THE CHERWELL WATER-LILY. 1. Bright came the last departing gleam To lonely Cherwell's silent stream, And for a moment stayed to smile On tall St. Mary's graceful pile. But brighter still the glory stood On Marston's scattered lines of wood. The lights that through the leaves were sent, Of gold and green were richly blent; Oh! beautiful they were to see, Gilding the trunk of many a tree, Just ere the colors died away In evening's meditative gray. Sweet meadow-flowers were round me spread, And many a budding birch-tree shed Its woodland perfume there; And from its pinkly-clustering boughs, A fragrance mild the hawthorn throws Upon the tranquil air. Deep rung St. Mary's stately chime The holy hour of compline time, And, as the solemn sounds I caught Over the distant meadows brought, I heard the raptured nightingale Tell, from yon elmy grove, his tale Of melancholy love, In thronging notes that seemed to fall As faultless and as musical As angel strains above:— So sweet, they cast on all things round A spell of melody profound. They charmed the river in its flowing, They stayed the night-wind in its blowing, They lulled the lily to her rest, Upon the Cherwell's heaving breast. 2. How often doth a wildflower bring Fancies and thoughts that seem to spring From inmost depths of feeling! Nay, often they have power to bless With their uncultured loveliness, And far into the aching breast There goes a heavenly thought of rest With their soft influence stealing. How often, too, can ye unlock, Dear Wildflowers! with a gentle shock, The wells of holy tears, While somewhat of a Christian light Breaks sweetly on the mourner's sight To calm unquiet fears! Ah! surely such strange power is given To lowly flowers, like dew, from heaven; For lessons oft by them are brought, Deeper than mortal sage hath taught, Lessons of wisdom pure, that rise From some clear fountains in the skies! 3. Fairest of Flora's lovely daughters That bloom by stilly-running waters, Fair Lily! thou a type must be Of virgin love and purity! Fragrant thou art as any flower That decks a lady's garden-bower. But he who would thy sweetness know, Must stoop and bend his loving brow To catch thy scent, so faint and rare, Scarce breathed upon the summer air. And all thy motions, too, how free, And yet how fraught with sympathy!— So pale thy tint, so meek thy gleam Shed on thy kindly father-stream! Still, as he swayeth to and fro, How true in all thy goings, As if thy very soul did know The secret of his flowings. And then that heart of living gold, Which thou dost modestly infold, And screen from man's too searching view Within thy robe of snowy hue! To careless men thou seem'st to roam Abroad upon the river, In all thy movements chained to home, Fast-rooted there for ever: Linked by a holy, hidden tie, Too subtle for a mortal eye, Nor riveted by mortal art, Deep down within thy father's heart. Emblem in truth thou art to me Of all a daughter ought to be! How shall I liken thee, sweet flower! That other men may feel thy power, May seek thee on some lovely night, And say how strong, how chaste the might, The tie of filial duty, How graceful too, and angel-bright, The pride of lowly beauty! Thou sittest on the varying tide As if thy spirit did preside With a becoming, queenly grace, As mistress of this lonely place; A quiet magic hast thou now To smooth the river's ruffled brow, And calm his rippling water: And yet so delicate and airy, Thou art to him a very fairy, A widowed father's only daughter. III. MEMORIALS OF A HAPPY TIME. “Ointment and perfumes rejoice the heart: and the good counsels of a friend are sweet to the soul.”—Proverbs xxvii. 9. 1.THE MEETING. Tell me, ye Winds and Waves! what power compels Souls far apart to be together brought, That they may love each other,—spirits taught To stoop and listen by Truth's ancient wells; Guiding their lives with the calm motion caught From their pure earthborn murmurings, the swells Of whose soft falling streams go chiming on, Heard best by hearts that travel there alone! One have I met, so meek a soul, that dwells In his own lowly spirit's cloistered cells: Him by that ancient mountain-rill I found, Touched mid the heedless throng with holiest spells, Striving to catch the stream's low thrilling sound, Where in a savage place it runneth underground. 2.THE LESSON. Listen—another strain!—I long had thought The scourge austere and stern self-punishment To school impatient spirits had been sent, And hoped their task would long ere this be wrought. Man works in haste, for speed with him is might: In depth and silence God's great works are laid, As in foundation-stones, all dimly bright. The world well knows it hath but one brief hour, And hurries by while judgment is delayed; And it is gifted with a fearful power Of holding back its own dark day of doom: But God keeps shrouded in His ancient gloom, Watching things travel to His own vast will; So He works on, and man keeps thwarting still. 3.THE VISION. That healthy wisdom did I late unfold Out of a precious type to me endeared. I saw an altar to the Graces reared, Of chaste proportions, by a green way-side. Trees of all sorts stood round it, gray and old, Blending their various leaves with solemn pride. A venerable shade it seemed to me, Where neither gloom nor garish light could be. Daily from off the shrine to azure heaven The quiet incense of soft thought was given; And ever rose, as if on angel's wings, The breezelike scent of high imaginings, Fragrant of glory I had never dreamed, So modest and so low that little altar seemed. 4.THE TEACHER. This was thy heart where I did fondly trace The way that God had gone: in little things And childish growths I found the hidden springs Where He had put His virtue. Thy short race In holy calm and evenness hath past. Oh! how unlike those gay and wayward hearts That might in Athens rise to bear their parts In the Greek torch-race: and with giddy haste Wave their bright pine about, and quench its blaze, Types of their own wild course in after days! Thy soul's most secret growings I have seen, Ordered by God so quietly and slow, That thou thyself, dear friend, dost scarcely know Or what thou art or what thou mightst have been. 5.THE TWO RIVERS. Come with me through these mountain-vales, and see! Two bravely-flowing streams this way have gone; Most musical their flowing is to me, So I will moralize awhile thereon. One decks the eastern vale—the loveliest; The other dashes onward from the west. They join in quiet fields: you scarce can know Which was the first to join. So, as is meet, The gentler nature doth the sterner greet, Because its name is softer and more sweet: And he, the elder, loves to have it so. Then in a lake they blend their kindred flow, And it is said, and so it ought to be, That they in one bright stream pass onward to the sea. 6.THE YOUNGER RIVER. [THE ROTHAY.] Come now and see yon orient vale outspread, And mark the windings of my favourite rill; For the wan olive-lights are on the hill, Dear autumn's choicest boon: and there is shed A most surpassing glory on the stream, Kindled just now by evening's purple gleam. Yon lake with shady islands gave it birth, To it yon English village doth belong, And many a night the joyousness and mirth Of its dear flow hath been my vesper song. See how it peeps in meadows fringed with flowers, Or nestles jealously mid leafy bowers, As if it almost felt, and shunned to show The gracefulness that makes men love it so. 7.THE ELDER RIVER. [THE BRATHAY.] Now follow me to yonder gloomy hills That to the westward rise: a thousand rills Gush wildly from their rifted sides to form That dark, romantic river's early course. It is the nursling of the cloudy storm, And carries somewhat of its mother's force Along with it: leaping with one mad bound Over a rocky fall. Yet are there found Pools of most silent beauty, calm and deep; Though there, too, glittering foam-bells tell a tale Of things before it reached that placid vale, Where the new church o'erhangs its woodland sweep. Oh! how these brooks with hidden meanings teem, Which no one in the world but you and I would dream! 8.THE PREPARATION. The clouds lay folded on the mountain's brow, A huge and restless curtain drooping low. This way and that it waved with solemn swell, And from behind it flakes of sunlight fell On many a patch of redly withering fern, Melting away upon them: far above Vast shapes were seen, uncouth and horrible, Masses of jagged rock that seemed to move, Turning where'er the rolls of cloud did turn, Piled up on high, a grim and desolate Throne: But no one was there that might sit thereon. All preparation had been made for One Who had not come. Ah! surely we must say, They looked for God being out on some great work that day! 9.THE WHEELS. There are strange solemn times when serious men Sink out of depth in their own spirit, caught All unawares, and held by some strong thought That comes to them, they know not how or when, And bears them down through many a winding cell Where the soul's busy agents darkly dwell; Each watching by his wheel that, bright and bare, Revolveth day and night to do its part In building up for Heaven one single heart. And moulds of curious form are scattered there, As yet unused,—the shapes of after deeds; And veilèd growths and thickly sprouting seeds Are strewn, in which our future life doth lie Sketched out in dim and wondrous prophecy. 10.THE GLIMPSE. Our many deeds, the thoughts that we have thought— They go out from us thronging every hour; And in them all is folded up a power That on the earth doth move them to and fro: And mighty are the marvels they have wrought In hearts we know not, and may never know. Our actions travel and are veiled: and yet We sometimes catch a fearful glimpse of one When out of sight its march hath well-nigh gone, An unveiled thing which we can ne'er forget! All sins it gathers up into its course, And then they grow with it, and are its force: One day with dizzy speed that thing shall come, Recoiling on the heart that was its home. 11.THE PERPLEXITY. And therefore when I look into my heart, And see how full it is of mighty schemes, Some that shall ripen, some be ever dreams, And yet, though dreams, shall act a real part,— When I behold of what and how great things I am the cause,—how quick the living springs That vibrate in me, and how far they go,— Thought doth but seem another name for fear; And I would fain sit still, and never rise To meddle with myself, God feels so near. And all the time He moveth, calm and slow And unperplexed, though naked to His eyes, A thousand thousand spirits pictured are, Kenned through the shroud that wraps the Heaven of heavens afar! 12.THE COMPLAINT. I heard thee say that thou wert slow of speech; Thou didst complain thy words could never reach The height of thy conceptions. Ah! dear friend, Envy thou not the eloquent their gift. Fierce reckless acts and thoughts' unbridled range And cherished passion that at times hath rocked Their soul to its foundations,—these do lift Them into eloquence: 'tis sad to spend So great a price, to win so poor a dower. Thine is a deep clear mind: nor inward change Nor outward visitation yet hath shocked Thy heart into a consciousness of power. So calm and beautiful thou art within, Thou scarce canst see how like power is to sin. 13.THE VOICE. “The multitude, therefore, that stood and heard, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spoke to Him.”—St. John, xii. 29. A Voice from ancient times comes up this way; Dost thou not hear it—like a trumpet call? O with what startling accents doth it fall On ears that love a softer siren sound! To them like muttering thunder still it seems, Though all the sky is open, free and gay. Month follows month, and year doth grow to year, And the strong voice keeps waxing yet more clear. The world is full of symptoms of decay, Feverish and intermittent, struck with fear, Starting unconsciously in savage dreams, Like aged men with sickly opiates bound. —It spake again: surely it cometh near, Let us go out upon the tower, and hear! 14.THE TEMPLE. “Know you not that your members are the Temple of the Holy Ghost?” I Cor. vi. 19. Come, I have found a Temple where to dwell: Sealed up and watched by Spirits day and night Behind the Veil there is a crystal Well. The glorious cedar pillars sparkle bright, All gemmed with big and glistening drops of dew, That work their way from out yon hidden flood By mystic virtue through the fragrant wood, Making it shed a faint unearthly smell. And from beneath the curtain, that doth lie In rich and glossy folds of various hue, Soft showers of pearly light run streamingly Over the chequered floor and pavement blue. Oh! that our eyes might see that Font of Grace, But none hath entered yet his own heart's Holy Place. 15.THE PRIEST. “And the people was waiting for Zachary.”—St. Luke, i. 21. As morning breaks or evening shadows steal, Duties and thoughts throng round the marble stair, Waiting for Him who burneth incense there, Till He shall send to bless them as they kneel. Greater than Aaron is the mighty Priest Who in that radiant shrine for ever dwells, Brighter the stones that stud His glowing vest, And ravishing the music of His bells, That tinkle as He moves. The golden air Is filled with motes of joy that dance and run Through every court, and make the temple one. —The lamps are lit; 'tis past the hour of prayer, And through the windows is their lustre thrown,— Deep in the Holy Place the Priest doth watch alone. 16.THE HUMILIATION. Yes, Lord! 'tis well my suffering should be deep; So with unsparing hand fill Thou the cup Of bitter thought, and I will drink it up, And then lie calmly down, yet not to sleep: But like a guilty child in penitence When some unruly act hath first destroyed Within his little soul the quiet sense Of filial love and careless innocence; And, as he feels his bliss with fear alloyed, He wakes, he knows not why, all night to weep. All human feeling grown to be intense Comes nigh to sin; yet ah! my greedy heart Cannot without a thankless murmur part From that pure dream it hath so long enjoyed. 17.THE HAUNTED PLACE REVISITED. I came again fair Esthwaite lake to view— The place thy spirit haunts; while sun and shower In light and shade contended every hour, And both were beautiful. The lake was still: Rich autumn lights were grouped upon the hill Mid purple heather and bright orange fern. Oh what a scene was there! The scarlet hue Of the wild cherry-tree did strangely turn To mockery the alder's solemn gray: And, as I wept outright, it seemed to say— “What art thou he that was so proud and stern? “Look at that silly furze all new and gay, “Poor plant! 'tis budding forth and blossoming “As if one year could have a second spring.” 18.A DREAM. A Spirit came upon me in the night, And led me gently down a rocky stair Unto a peopled garden, green and fair, Where all the day there was an evening light. Trees out of every nation blended there. The citron shrub its golden fruit did train Against an English elm: 'twas like a dream Because there was no wind; and things did seem All near and big, like mountains before rain. Far in those twilight bowers beside a stream The soul of one who had but lately died Hung listening, with a brother at his side; And no one spoke in all that haunted place, But lookèd quietly into each other's face. IV. THE MOURNER'S DREAM. ARISING FROM A STRANGE AND DISTRESSING IMPRESSION OF A FRIEND'S DEATH IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY. “Wir müssen nach der Heimath gehn Um diese heil'ge Zeit zu sehn.” Novalis. By a steep winding vale I left A terrace in a mountain cleft. Old pines with ruddy boles were there, Half-gilded by the sunny air. The holm oaks, planes, and service-trees Hung motionless without a breeze. No vernal gale or summer stir Bent the green cones upon the fir. No water, tinkling as it fell, Taught the young birds their earliest sound, Or in its murmuring way unbound The sylvan languor of the dell. All through the shaggy gorge were seen Tree-tops and folds of various green; And noon with pleasant silence there Loaded the misty drooping air, And, birdlike, seemed herself to brood O'er a vast couch of glorious wood. I chose a moss and wild-flower bed Where many-fingered cedars shed All down the slope dark flakes of shade, And grateful dusky sunlight made. Ever before my half-closed eyes The sundered mountain-peaks did rise; And though I knew each field and rill That lay beyond that mighty hill, Yet still the wondrous cleft did seem A pass whereby a mourner's dream To other worlds might travel, And somewhat of his brother's state, In dreadest twilight separate, Might sleep perchance unravel. 1.THE RUINED HARBOUR. I stood, methought, in some lone place,— A fallen city, at whose base That summer noon the shining sea Made all soft sounds perpetually; And, as it swelled, its liquid fall Scarce lifted the weeds on the harbour-wall: And the little waves, all one by one, Far out in furrows green did run, And then lay down and sparkled in the sun! There was no shade, no leafy tree, Yet waited I by that fair sea, And watched the ocean-water fill With its clear self, and at its will, The broken harbour's ample round, Without a wave and without a sound! So men have watched their friends for hours, Filling with silent love, While dreams fall on them both in showers, Like starlights from above; Till the bright waters, as they rise, Mount and run over at the eyes. Oh! who that in youth's morning light With sails full-set and songs did ride Into love's harbour with the tide, Hath dreamed that it would ebb at night? Through the long hours of noon I stood Alone in that sunny solitude. Not a voice was in the weed-grown way, Not a ship was on the wave, The sea was by itself all day, And the streets were like a grave, All things were still as they could be, The sand, the city, and the sea! I lingered there—for on my breast A weight of weary sorrow pressed; My soul, like a mourner, low did bend Over the memory of my dead friend. Yet there is somewhat in the tear Of deep affection's willing sadness To the lone heart more kind and dear Than the strong smile of health and gladness; And it is better, for our love's sake, they We love the best should soonest go away. I thought of him, as though he were by, With his dark bright hair, and his darker eye, And his face alive with chivalry, Of his broad white brow with a slender vein, And his words like drops of summer rain, Soft as the voice of a timid maiden, Ever with his own brave language laden. I have hung on his words, so sweet and rare, Like a knight in his lady's bower, With his voice in my ears, like a haunting air, For many a dreaming hour. The eloquent smile that ever hung O'er his mouth, like a sunny wreath, Grew lovelier on his lips, and clung Ten times more glorious after death. There is a spell on his silent tongue, As when a poet dies And the spirits bind his lyre unstrung To the bier whereon he lies. I saw thy beautiful limbs all bare, And thy new-made grave looked cold, And I grudged it sadly to the mould To lie so long on thy glossy hair! Minstrel! thy spirit was set on fire At the fount of ancient days, And therefore wert thou lifted higher, To where that fountain plays. Sacred and pure, the awful flame About thy youth and health did roll, Till thy fair vest of earth became A sacrifice unto thy soul. Like an eagle, up in the heavens bare, Wild with the draughts of his mountain air, The heights of lone thought beheld thee die In the fire of thine own free poetry! 2.THE VOYAGE. I waited then by that fair sea Till the power of evening came on me. I saw the sunset colours fall Paler and fainter on the wall, And watched the broken shadows grow Dark and long on the sand below; And the sea was gone far down the shore With the same soft sounds for evermore. Still on the quivering level lay The last dull crimson lights of day, When to my feet a bright green boat Softly and gaily seemed to float, With neither helm, nor sail, nor oar, Over the shallows on the shore. Green it was as the living tide Whereon its little prow should ride, And lighter than the foam-wreaths frail That o'er the windy ocean sail. Within, a silver Anchor stood, And a Crucifix of scented wood Upon the seat was laid; And round it some large foreign flowers With fresh leaves from the ivy bowers Into a crown were made. Swifter and swifter did I float Eastward in the bright green boat; And, as the coast grew dim and white, I sank in awe upon my knee, And trusted myself for the dark night To the holy Cross and to the sea. No breath upon the deep did move, The moon was not in her place above. With steadiest motion all along The boat on her path did steal, Without a sound, but the murmuring song Of the water round the keel: And through the gloom, without a bound, The purple ocean lay around. The snowy sea-birds as they flew Across the deep midnight, From off their lustrous plumage threw Flashes of sudden light. Yet did I not feel lonely there, For ever a scent, like incense rare, Stole from the Cross on the warm night air; And the dew that clung upon the flowers Sweet memories of earth's pale bowers Back to my heart did bring: Like the cold and sunny winds that yield The fragrance out of the meadow field In the first fresh days of spring. And thus was that little boat to me A quiet Church on the holy sea! But seven bright planets, one by one, Rose from the waves as the boat drove on; They rose in a crescent above the sea, At first unclear, and falteringly, But up in the sky the starry bow Pierced with its rays the billows below, And the tall thin shafts of palest gold Wavered and bent as the waters rolled,— Bent, but they broke not; and the light Was fairer far than a summer night, When the moon, unthrifty of her brightness, Paves the sea with a trembling whiteness. Onward still did the shallop sail, Till the sea was green and the stars grew pale; And the sun as from the waves he went Unlocked the pearly orient. But eastward yet the bark did steal, So swift the waves scarce wet the keel; While in the dawn the cold fresh sea Shone bright and murmured merrily. Our life lies eastward: every day Some little of that mystic way By trembling feet is trod: In thoughtful fast and quiet feast Our thoughts go travelling to the East, To our Incarnate God. Fresh from the Font our childhood's prime Is life's most oriental time. Its joyous sights and mighty fears, And feelings deep that work by tears, Its dreams and smiles age cannot share, Are borrowed from that region fair. The beamy land, where morning lives And Eden still is blooming, gives Strange rays for childish hearts to hoard, Bright flashes from the seraph-sword That waves in Eden's light: And still, when childhood's race is run And God from Egypt calls His son, Through worldliest haze and rudest gleams, The East comes back to us in dreams, In holy dreams by night. 'Tis then o'er marvellous maps we pore, Bare outlines of the Eastern shore, And idly strive to fix the spot Where Eden lies, with cave and grot, And lawn, and river-sounds, away In the heart of central Asia. 'Tis then love singles out the trees With foreign-looking leaves, And oft in summer's languid breeze Poor fancy sits and weaves Of each exotic shrub and flower A shadow of an Eden bower. When childhood's painted flag is furled, And long chill shadows from the world Are o'er our pathway thrown, Still, while its early dreams escape, The longing spirit fain would shape An orient of its own. Still doth it Eastward turn in prayer, And rear its saving Altar there, Still doth it Eastward turn in Creed, While faith in awe each gracious deed Of her dear Saviour's love doth plead,— Still doth it turn at every line To the far East—in sweet mute sign That through our weary strife and pain We crave our Eden back again. We came unto a river's mouth, Which hath its secret fountains Away in the unpeopled south, Among unpeopled mountains. A sultry haze upon the sea, And long low shore, lay heavily. A bar of rocks stretched east and west The frothy shallows under, On which the chafing billows pressed And broke in muffled thunder; And further up the misty land The waves foamed idly on the sand; And on the sandbanks in the bay Sea-dogs and seals together lay; As though the hot mist of noon were sweet After the deep's cold gloom, They slept like the dogs at the marble feet Of a Templar on his tomb. All was still as a place of the dead, Not a mountain lifted his far-off head, Not an outline blue was seen. Grass was not there, nor shady trees, Not a branch or blade of green, But a row of seaside villages With low sand-hills between. The bar is bare where the white waves sound, And tide and stream are quivering round, But the bark hath crossed, for the river bound. It lay on the mane of a long green billow, As a gull might rest on her ocean pillow, It flew, like foam, o'er the ragged bar, And shook where the waters quiver, But steady and strong the keel stood far Up the Asiatic river. 3.THE WORLD'S EDGE. Many an afternoon hath come Since then to my monastic home, When mem'ry hath brought back to me In lifelike form and order The mighty things which I did see On that wild river border: Days when the autumn garden grieves Amid the gentle wreck of leaves, Strewn by the summer's parting spirit For winter's stern winds to inherit; When silvery sun and fleecy sky Once more bring feeble summer nigh, As though she came to some sweet nook 'Mid faded lawns and bowers, Awhile to take a farewell look At rash November flowers: And in this Christian city living My heart hath flown away, While mem'ry's deepest wells kept giving Visions of Asia. We left behind the sea's dull roar, We left the sand-hills on the shore: We passed through plains wherein the stream Ran broad by many a barrow, Through forests proof 'gainst bright sunbeam, Where the bed was deep and narrow: Where winds the mighty trees had rocked For many a hundred year; And troops of gentle creatures flocked To gaze on me with fear, As though their faces bright and round Had seen and heard of sight and sound Nought but the forest motion, Save when a sea-bird rude had come And scared the quiet of their home, As it wandered from the ocean. The twisting branches framed above Cloisters of gloomy green, And the bare boughs of yew-trees wove On either side a screen; But here and there the eye might follow The view through many a woodland hollow, To where some fountain glittered far With red leaves all around, When a stray sunbeam, like a star Its way through thick shades found; And it bred fear in me to see At times a dry leaf from a tree, Loosened by some soft hand unseen From its brother-crowd of healthy green, Awhile upon the light air quiver, And faintly fall upon the river. The wood was past; and then again Came grassy slope and open plain; And to a lake the river spread, With groves and green rocks islanded. When evening shed her mantle there, Slow-dropping through the twilight air, Upon the river-bank there stood Temple, and tower, and streets decayed, Shrine, palace, arch, and colonnade,— A vast and kingly solitude. Dark creepers like a woven vest Were round each standing pillar pressed; Between the broken columns sprung Horse-tail and rankest adder's-tongue. No voice of man or beast was heard, No vesper-song of plaining bird, No insect hum, no breath did seem To rise from those that sleep and dream Among yon cypress rows that stand For half a league or more inland. The city lay in mute distress On the edge of a stretching wilderness. Where have ye gone, ye townsmen great! That have left your homes so desolate? Where have ye vanished, king and peer! And left what ye lived for lying here? Sin can follow where gold may not, Pictures and books the damps may rot, And creepers may hang frail lines of flowers Down the crevices of ancient towers, But what hath passed from the soul of mortal, Be it word or thought of pride, Hath gone with him through the dim low portal, And waiteth by his side. Between the desert and the town, Upon a grassy treeless down, High hanging o'er the rapid flood A house of Christian monks there stood. One soft low bell kept ever ringing While they within were calmly singing Of her whose garments drop alway Myrrh, aloes, and sweet cassia. The chapel-lights with full rich gleam Threw lines of radiance o'er the stream; And tear-drops came, and o'er my mind Dim thoughts and sadnesses did wind, And with strong spells my spirit bind. It was no grave or holy feeling That with the Christian psalm came stealing, Which sounded all my being so, And stirred the tears, and bade them flow. No, it was earth with her fair things, All her green trees and mountain springs, Earth fading from me, which did pass Upon my spirit through the glass Of those church-windows, to the river Whereon the lamplights rest and quiver. It brought back hours when I did stand A guest in our first father-land, Where summer midnights sweetest shine With moonbeams cradled on the Rhine, Or drawn in tremulous webs of gold, Where the stream through long boat-bridges rolled. And earth and all earth was to me In those short hours of boyish glee Came like a cloud of troubled fears, And the cloud broke and fell in tears. Yet it was well those monks should be By the ruin hoar and the pasture lea; And never was spot more sadly meet For lonely prayer and hermit feet. And fitly, methinks, their chantry stands, Where the grass encroaches on the sands, At the limits of life's two marvellous lands,— The land of shadows, forms, and faces, And the land of spirits' resting-places. For the psalm they sing is earth's last sound, Circling and sinking faintly round, And whispering o'er the desert's bound. The bodies that lie where the turf springs highest, And little white flowers are growing, Of all the dead are the very nighest To the place where they are going, For over the sand in the stilly morn, When the winds awhile cease blowing, If you lean and listen a sound is borne, Like the last far fall of a hunting-horn, From the Eden streams, that in channels worn By two and two are flowing. Yes—it was well these monks should tread Between the living and the dead On the line by which they are severèd,— That they in their fasts and festal mirth A blessing and grace should merit For the far-off races of the earth From the close-lying world of spirit. Yes—it was well that they should be Types of the meek and passion-free, The humble of earth, that in cloistered room Fight the world's battles in secret gloom; And lands are saved and conquests won, And the race of high and hard truths run, And chains snapped off and sins undone: And all by meek, dejected men, Earth finds not, learns not, how or when. For they are too divinely great For fame to sully them with state And pageant little worth: From out the unpolluted dead Their names may not be gatherèd; They dwell too deep for man to find Them out in their calm mirth, Too high to leave a name behind, To be played with on the earth. No idle straying sage may learn How that ruined city fell; All travellers unknowing turn From the spot where those monks dwell. Out in the earth fair babes at play By unseen hands are led away. Here and there in different climes Some have been missed at distant times; In sport by day they have been taken, No mortal creature knowing, In sleep by night, and did not waken Their mothers at their going. Whene'er the monks of that house die, These lost of earth their room supply, By angel-leadings ever drawn From their first homes in childhood's dawn; And strangely many times must earth Work in their heart with her old mirth. On the edge of the world to them it is given To be within sight and hearing of heaven, To see the wild clouds, like castles or ships, Kissed with the evening's rosy lips, Sway in the wind on the hills that spread, Treeless and turfless a barrier dread, Round the garden our father forfeited, They dwell alone, those monkish few, By the down's slant side and the river blue. No bird o'er the narrow down may fly, No eagle abroad in yon desert cry, No beast may come as near as they To the sealéd centre of Asia. There is a spot—I know not why— A spot I often loiter by, Which ever brings that ruined town, The monkish house and strip of down, Back to my fancy, faintly clear, Until the whole doth strangely seem A suddenly recovered dream, Which I had somewhile dreamed of here. It is the least of English brooks Through a midland county winding, In willow flats and meadow nooks Fresh sorts of wild-flowers finding: The very least of brooks—with bays Of standing water furnished, Where yellow irises upraise Their phalanx smoothly burnished: The least of brooks, that nightly show The white stars' moving faces Mid dark and brittle plants that grow In its wet and shady places. Much hooded willow-herb is there, The nun of water-sides, whose care Doth for herself green convents rear Of stalk and leaf and glossy spear. And when I wander there alone, My spirit doth unravel The lines of thought she made her own In her visionary travel. But up the stream with steady will My boat went undelaying, While earth stirred calmly in me still, And set my fancy straying. And now around is a sandy scene Without one square or isle of green, A region, where with no sweet shrouds The sun, as he doth pass, Unclothes the white sky of its clouds, And the green earth of her grass. But the moon is floating soft above, And the sands below are glistening; There might be sounds in the lights that move O'er the earth, like the wings of a weary dove, If there were time for listening. But the winds from their hid coverts press, And lift their waving voices high O'er the broad waste, to magnify The Master of the wilderness. So wild was the gleam the moon was lending, So broken it looked in its descending, The desert's self seemed heaving; One might think that mighty winds came out To scatter molten moonlight about, To mar the plain words and meaning things That, for man, aloft on her glitterings The quiet orb was weaving. Then came a royal wood of palms With strange and oriental charms. The forest stood down to the river, Yet seemed to stretch away for ever. League upon league like pillars tall With one rich shapely capital In aisles they stood, and like each other, One palm might be its neighbour's brother. And all were fair and fresh of hue, As though in some good plain they grew, And not in sand-drifts light. The moisture drunk by thirsty noon Cool darkness doth replenish soon With dewdrops sparkling bright, Dews fed from mists that bear the moon Sweet company all night. And down the rings of each smooth bole, Like sunbeams under the sea, Quiverings of emerald moonlight stole, Swathing the golden tree. Turn where one might a roaming eye, On, on, for ever on, The multitudinous palm-trees lie, Countless as stars that stud the sky, When the rival moon has gone. Hast thou ever felt in thy lonely room, Some vigil night, when the hush and gloom, And the nearness of churches round the place, Bring joy in the soul and smiles on the face— When the walls of the world seem about to melt, And to lay the wierd realms of spirit bare,— Hast thou ever at such high seasons felt What seemed like the waving of wings in air, While an angel meek hath descended there, And is kneeling where thou hast lately knelt? Hast thou known how his presence keeps thee still, And winds through thy thoughts like a freshening rill, How visions and musings of lightness or pride Fall off from thy heart as withered leaves, And fancy dares not with him at her side Think well of the silky webs she weaves? So was it with me in that little boat That stiller and swifter seemed to float. The flowers and ivy-stalks drooping low Sweeter and fresher appeared to grow. A faint scarce visible glory stood O'er the Crucifix of scented wood; And though the seat at the helm looked bare, I knew that a spirit was sitting there. The bark had now begun to quiver Upon the fast, unsteady river, And foam-bells wavered by; And with the lisping palm-tops blending A stunning water-fall's descending Grew distinct and nigh. There was a pause—a brief, dread pause In a narrow valley's rocky jaws. A huge, high cliff did steeply bound A sunless pool with white mists round. Then came a quiet, whirling motion, And my boat was lifted slow; Like the strong twistings of the ocean, Where a ship hath gone below. Oh! gently are the currents flowing Above that giant-fall, And gentle sounds, like breezes blowing, From off the mountains' call, The herbless mountains nigh at hand That darkly fence man's earliest land, Still wept with burning brow, Which every bright or gloomy faith Hath faintly looked for after death, Or made an idol now. We came unto the river fountains, Where three of those huge-rooted mountains Jutted beyond the range, And clasped within their stony round A basin and a ring of ground Of beauty soft and strange. There in that most lonely dwelling The rivers of the south are welling From a silent-rising spring: And to the surface from below The silver, salient waters flow With scarce a murmuring. Below the sterile cliffs a rim Of yellow moorland turf the brim Of that calm basin closes; And right among the tarnished sedge There hangs and floats a flowering hedge Of whitest gleaming roses. No greenly-gadding rose-branch dips Into the pool its fragrant lips. But drooping ever motionless In one white coronal they press The velvet margin shading; Like some pale lustrous wreath adorning A bride upon her marriage morning,— Eternal and unfading; Breathing faint richness on the lake, Whose gleamy face winds never shake, Nor ripples crest, nor rain-drops break:— Where rose with rose in webs is threading, Thick spells of luscious strength outshedding, That make the mountain hollow seem One noonday cup of odorous steam. Wondrous it is to see on high The barren mountains to the sky Their splintered sceptres holding; While Heaven's ethereal blue between The outlines rough doth intervene, And spends all hours, that fearful scene To shapes of softness moulding: Just as the monthly moon's full orb In her own fairness doth absorb The boughs of leafy dells, And purple midnight by sweet laws Upward and inward ever draws Church-spires and pinnacles. Strange is it to the eye that rests On the long line of mountain crests, Whose slow descending gaze but falls On craggy steeps and dark bare walls,— Strange is it when the earth discloses That little hollow cup of roses. Across the pool my boat did steal In swift and silent order, And not a ripple from the keel Ruffled the flowery border. Above the place where I was left There was a deep, clear mountain cleft, As though some keen seraphic sword, Some Angel of the mighty Lord, Had carved that portal fair. To skies beyond of stainless blue White waving clouds went sailing through, As if to harbour there. But poor and little was my hope To climb that cliff and broken slope, Till I beheld a straggling line Of low white roses dimly shine, As if put there in play, Or some angelic hand in air Had scattered rose-wreaths kindly there To trace and mark the way. Where each frail flowret had been thrown There was a little step of stone, Whereto a man might cling, Or, if they failed, be lifted on By angel hand or wing: And with such faith myself would dare Upon that long and perilous stair. How may I tell ye, friends on earth! With what a mystery of mirth I stood within that mountain cleft, With two worlds, on the right and left? Boundless, boundless, all unending, Shadows, souls, and spirits blending— Midnight and sun-rise, noon and even, Earth, ocean, vivid-glowing Heaven— All were at once:—all bathed and blent In a new white-seeming element, Wherein they did abide: Most like unto a hoary sea, Where through all ages by decree Time might have no more ebbs, but be For ever at high-tide. It travelled on in mighty rings, And with a clamorous motion; Like a sea-bird sleeping on her wings And sinking to the ocean. I stood within the mountain-cleft With two worlds, on the right and left— The land of shadows, forms, and faces, And the land of spirits' resting-places. Apart, and separate they were, With other sky and sea and air: And yet they seemed but one to me— Each in the other comprehended, In lovely separation blended, Like two sides of a mystery. Oft have I seen in out-door dreams Lovely and dreadful things Brought close upon my soul by gleams,— Majestic glimmerings. But, when I deemed the vision bright Unfolding from the soul of night Unto my touch would press, The troublous pleasure that did creep Through every vein, broke up my sleep, And the appearance swiftly drew Back into midnight's caverned blue And starry silentness; As rainbows to my childish eye Withdrew into the cloudy sky, When gazed at over-earnestly. Thus hath this dream been broken up, And gentle sleep's well-mingled cup Been spilt upon the earth; But dreams that promise fairest blessing, Yet cease to be in the possessing— Why blame them more than other things, Since Heaven in love so checks the springs Of every mortal mirth? V. THE DREAM OF KING CRŒSUS. King Crœsus dreamed a dream: the live-long day His heart was swollen with imperial pride, And his eye surfeited with blaze of gems And gleamy metals, and his weak ear soothed By fair-tongued Lydians: but in the still night King Crœsus dreamed a dream: 'twas Nemesis That out of the mute darkness wove that dream. He slept, and in his sleep he saw his son, Atys, the beautiful, the chosen Atys, The youthful warrior,—him he saw in dark Confused embrace with hazy struggling forms, Masses, which peopled all the blank of night, Like bruised embossing on a lance-worn shield. He could not extricate from thence, nor clear One object which man's eye should recognize; Only he saw Atys—Atys he saw, His son, undoubted, manifest: ah woe! Only he saw Atys,—torn with the point Of some invisible implement; he saw The point, and Atys, and his own child's blood. Such was the dream King Crœsus dreamed that night. There is a sound as of a nuptial feast Throughout the low-roofed Sardis; tabor, lute And Phrygian pipe in sweet accord are there, Making such music as the easterns love, Monotonous and wailing: there are lights And cries and banquet sounds, and all the throng Of nuptial celebration. Dark and dim From Mother Dindymene's sacred hill Hermus flows down into the noisy plain, Where night is turned to day, and hurries on His waters troubled with the unwonted glare Into the quiet, misty distance. Oh Strange apparition is a flowing stream By a gay city in the obscure night! It is the nuptial feast of Atys. Ay, And will King Crœsus baffle destiny, And flaunt the venerable Nemesis With nuptial feasts and women's chambers? No— For though the warrior's arms be laid aside, And though the boar-spear for the hunt be thrown In some neglected corner, though the walls That rang with armor wave with tapestry,— Yet sooner shall the soil instead of fruit Bring forth sharp-pointed things, and mortals reap Lance-heads for harvests, than the holy path Of orderly and reverend fate be turned This way or that. Mute matter and the beasts Achieve Heaven's wrath or love upon the earth. What ails the King? Why seeks he never now The vaulted treasure-house, the metals, gems, And costly inwrought works? His restless eye Is palled with brightness, and his regal pride— That hath gone down, ay, sunk, for ever sunk In the deep ocean of paternal love. Yet wherefore looketh he with curious search Through all the palace and among his guards And on state days and in the public place, Lest a keen weapon or some pointed thing Should come nigh Atys? He would charm the life Of the brave, princely boy; he would rob fate (And cannot kings do all things?) of the prize. It is the Dream: that Dream is in his heart, Stirring, like spring within the unconscious earth Setting the unborn summer in array. The power that wove the Dream doth also work Out in the world. The toils of Nemesis Are closing round thee, Crœsus! oh how near! There came a stranger to the Lydian court, A man of unclean hands, a fratricide, And yet withal a gentle being, one Whose noble blood of Phrygia's royal line Was least of his endowments; one of those Whose fortune is a mystery on the earth, A painful problem, gendering thought and tears Even in the sage, and in the unrestrained A refuge oft for easy misbelief— As though by some dread fate perversely thrown Upon the very opposite of all Their passions and propensions, not allowed To hit the scope at which their nature aims. Men are they, by compulsion of the world And the disturbing force of circumstance Led forth, like victims, out of their own sphere To act some other spirit's destiny: Who pass away, still having in themselves A better destiny all unfulfilled, A holier, milder being unevolved. Such was Adrastus, with a gentle tinge Of softness and a partial hallowing Of deep romance, an almost wayward love Of sadness, and a clinging to the woe Which had exhausted and absorbed the hope Of his whole being. He had shed the blood Of his own brother most unwittingly, And came to Crœsus that from him he might Receive the expiation of the times,— A cleansing power, most rightly gathered up Into the state and person of the prince, A portion of divinity enthroned, Like a peculiar instinct, in a king, Who, by his unity no less than by His height, doth adumbrate the One Supreme. With running water and the kingly word Adrastus was made clean, and dwelt, a guest Of Crœsus, I might almost say, a son. When by the hearth the stranger's shadow fell King Crœsus knew not that it was the cloud Of Nemesis upon his royal house: So little venerable in our sight Is present Providence—when past, how great! All things concur with Nemesis: she sent A fugitive from Phrygia thus to be Her shadow and her symbol in the house Of the great king whom she had singled out To teach men, by his eminence and griefs, The righteousness of Heaven. In other lands She makes fresh preparation, and the ring Of destiny is slowly narrowing in; The victim cannot stir, he cannot do A transitory act, but he therein Is riveting the future on himself. Crœsus! awake! Thy Dream is on thee,—rise! Whence are these foreign husbandmen, who throng The audience-hall at Sardis, suppliants rude? They are from pastoral Mysia, come to tell How a huge boar from rough Olympus robs The sheep-folds, thins the lowing kine, and treads The vineyards and the flax and silky maize Beneath his feet. “Will Crœsus deign to send “His princely son and famous Lydian dogs “And hunters of renown, to free the land, “And leave his name all o'er the Mysian fields “Fragrant as incense to the pastoral tribes?” To whom the King made answer: “Speak no more “Of Atys; he must tarry with his bride, “Whom it were graceless at this hour to leave. “The hounds and hunters ye are free to take, “And rid fair Mysia of the uncouth beast.” It grieved the heart of Atys; he was grieved That he should be shut out from manly toils, From winning love, and walking in men's eyes A prince by deeds as well as royal birth. He came unto his father and knelt down, Knelt down before his father and his King, And sued with piteous words: “O royal Sire! “With our progenitors it was esteemed “That battlefield and hunting-ground should be “The theatres of princes:—Hath the law “Been changed in Lydia that thou shuttest me “From such employ? Father! what cowardice, “Or what faint spirit hast thou marked in me? “How shall I come and go within the streets “Of this great Sardis, how endure the eyes “That speak worse words than those men would address “Unto me if I were not prince? Dear Sire! “My very bride will point me with her finger, “And call me ‘Woman,’ wishing that she had “A man to be the father of her sons! “I pray thee let me go unto this hunt, “Or reason with me why I should not go.” Crœsus was mindful of his bygone youth, Which was an echo to the young man's words. A teardrop stood within the proud King's eye; He was a father, and he wept and smiled. “O Atys, my son Atys, I have not, “The gods forfend it! aught in thee observed “Unprincely, or beneath the graciousness “Born to the sons of kings. I had a dream,” (And here a trembling passed upon the King) “A dream one night, when I had spent the day “Amid my treasures: I would not disturb “The quiet happiness of thy young life “By speaking of the vision, but I kept “The burden at my heart, and there it lay “The secret cause of my unwonted mien “And gesture; nay, in many little ways “It hath unkinged me. Atys! it declared “Thy span of life to be but brief: it spoke “Of death by weapon-point. Therefore it was “I hastened on thy nuptials, if so be “I might for my life-time enjoy thy life, “A theft, a stolen joy, the spoil of fate. “Thou art my chosen son, nay art thou not “Mine only one, thy brother being deaf, “To whom the outer world is but a show “Like wind-tossed trees upon the mountain top, “Or Hermus lapsing mutely through the town, “Too gentle, as the stricken always are, “Not one whom men could bow to as a king?” Young Atys listened, not without some awe, For he had piety towards the gods, And dreams and portents were unto his soul Its faith and fear, not wholly without love. O the sweet science of our youth, to find A way wherein our wills may go, a cause For action in the very reasonings Whereby men prove to us we should not act! Thus Atys spoke, the princely casuist, Pouring his honey in a father's ear:— “O father! blessèd art thou for the love “Wherewith thou hast thus loved me! yet indeed “Its very fervor leadeth thee astray “From the true purport of the dream. 'Tis thus: “I am to die by point of iron spear. “Father, dear father! are the tusks of boars “In that green Mysia made of iron points? “Elsewhere they are of bone! Now art thou not, “Dear father! art thou not a timorous king “And an unwise? Why truly I shall think “It is my mother governs Lydia now, “So good, so kind, and yet so timorous, “So very full of sweet maternal wiles.” He shook his flaxen hair from off his brow, And looked and laughed into the old King's face: And the King laughed again at his rude boy, Atys, the beautiful, the flaxen-haired. Crœsus! beware, the Dream is on thee now! But the Dream wrought; he let young Atys go: Fathers are evil pleaders with their sons. King Crœsus sat within his audience-hall, Fixed like a statue on his marble throne, Silent and troubled, like a man who feels He hath done that which he shall one day rue. How cold, how weak the words of Atys seemed Now that the youth was gone; yea, he was gone, Atys, the beautiful, the flaxen-haired, Whose eloquence was his young face and not His reasonings, his light laugh and not his speech. For a sweet look and for a pretty gibe Atys, the flaxen-haired, was sold to fate. A daily bargain is it on the earth; Forsooth to-day a hundred sons have been To bondage sold in foolishness of love Which is not love, through weakness falling short. O father Crœsus—yet it was the Dream. The Dream hath reached King Crœsus. And behold! Where'er he turns dread Nemesis is there. Things turn to Nemesis beneath his touch. His servants are the slaves of fate: his guest Fate's shadow, and the sunbeam in the eye Of Atys is the light of fate; the shake Of his long flaxen hair belonged to fate. The royal house is compassed by a Power Which hath absorbed all wills into its own. Sorrow and mirth, the hour of kingly pride Within the treasure-house, the nuptial feast, The blood in Phrygia spilled, the mountain boar, The husbandmen, the fame of Lydian dogs, The kneeling boy, the gibe, the flaxen hair,— All grow into one shadow, and advance Upon King Crœsus, like an angry god. King Crœsus saw it not; he did not know He was become the centre of his Dream. Alas! King Crœsus, we are all like thee, Fate teaching us the worship of free-will. King Crœsus sat within the audience-hall, Silent and troubled: Atys had gone forth To make his preparations for the hunt. The monarch bade them call the Phrygian prince; Adrastus stood before him. “Noble guest!” King Crœsus spake, “amid the royal state “Wherewith thou seest me compassed, at my heart “A hot uneasy secret hath lain hid, “Which threatens now to bring forth bitter fruit “Of dire affliction. I have cleansed thy hands, “And given thee kingly greeting, and a home, “And appanage, and all things meet for thee, “As though thou hadst been Atys, my true son. “Nay, stranger, I recount not these small things “As debts for which thou art to pay me back “Measure for measure; nor upbraidingly “As though the kindness lay too light on thee. “I seek return most different in kind, “I would thou shouldst go forth unto this hunt. “Thou art a gentle, princely man; I trow “Atys would be as safe beneath thy charge “As though King Crœsus went with him. The land “Is wild, and there are perils of the way; “Haply a father magnifies them, yet “I would that Atys went with thee, my guest! “And thou too hast great sires, unto whose deeds “'Twere well to link thine own; thy stalwart prime “Without achievements should not thus elapse: “Adrastus! thou art born a Phrygian prince, “The column of an old and generous name!” “Monarch and father!” thus Adrastus said, “I should not otherwise have sought this hunt. “A sorrow-stricken man should not essay “To join himself unto his peers: the gods “Have taken him apart unto themselves, “Clouding his days; nor have I now a soul “For martial enterprise, or glorious deeds “Of princely prowess, isolated thus “From my long line of royal ancestors, “Thro' exile, ay, thro' worse than exile dead. “Yet for thy sake I go, content to have “Thy joy for my reward in that sweet hour “When I shall give back Atys to thine arms.” King Crœsus left the audience-hall assured. Ah! he hath drawn the Dream unto himself, And of his own free will embraced his fate. There is not now a fibre in his heart At which that Vision pulls not every hour. Methinks I see the glittering plain outspread At sunny dawn, and Hermus flowing by, And the blue mountains, north and south and east, With Sypylus, which half fills up the west, Catching the sunrise, in whose rifted crags The thunder tolls all summer, day and night,— And the white walls of Sardis, and the King Waving his last farewell from near the gate. And o'er the Acropolis I see the snow On Tmolus, where the long-lived shepherds dwell, Tending their sable goats upon the downs With purple saffron streaked, while breezy morn Wafts o'er the plain from out the shrubby glens That aromatic breath so dear to Pan. And old Pactolus guides his lucid stream Between two lips of ruddy sand, which glow Like webs of golden tissue in the sun. Far off the tomb of Alyattes gleams Through the low mist, whose sluggish climbing folds Its lofty cone o'ertops, and shoots on high, Clearing its way into the radiant air. And in the wind the lake of Gyges seems Of silver shot with black, whose bright expanse Regions of plumy marsh-plants intersect, From out whose nodding coverts at that hour The countless swans rise up to greet the morn With tuneless pipings, which, with resonance Conjoined of insect-swarms, that from the lake Keep off the restless thirsty herds, are now The only sounds that desolately thrill That solitary shore of Lydian tombs. Then the brave band of men and dogs went on O'er hill and dale, and, when the sunbeams glanced Upon the spear-points of the horsemen there, It was the brightness of the Dream that moved With them to its fulfilment constantly. Atys, with beamy spear-points girdled round, Beguiled Adrastus somewhat of his woe, Recounting stories of the famous hunts, Which he had heard within the banquet hall By rhapsodists recited to the King From Lydian chronicles: and then he spake Of his young bride, or bade Adrastus note The plumage of the bird that darted by, Or the thick fleets of rapid ortolans Which swam along the surface of the maize, Or on a sudden sank and disappeared. He asked the name of this or that blue cone Which glimmered in the sun, or thoughtlessly He pointed to the dogs, and asked the prince If there were such in Phrygia, then confused He talked of other things scarce knowing what. Then languor seized him, and the weariness Of the tame distance, and they had some hours Of silent riding; but a bubbling brook, And hunter's fare and slumber in the shade Of single plane trees, such as here and there, Like tents, rise up in those unwoody parts, Refreshed the youth, and ever from his talk Adrastus gathered peace and freshness too. And thus they travelled to the Mysian border, In its green mountain-glens to meet the Dream. How beautiful are still and starry nights On the great plains of Asia! And how clear The yellow moon in glossy-foliaged dells Where shrunken brooks are tinkling through the night! Oh I shall think unto my dying day, When I outlive the strength of roving youth, How beautiful are nights on Asia's plains! The dome of heaven scarce arched above the earth With the low hanging moon, and lustrous stars Orblike and swollen with unusual light, The night-wind, fragrant with a thousand gums, Moaning, as weary of its homeless life Over those countless leagues of inland steppe, The little tents, the smouldering fire of wood, The scattered arms, the horses on the plain, Dim, dusky figures, feeding or at rest:— What Atys and Adrastus saw is still Seen nightly in that old unchanging land. Amid the green and bosky roots, from which Mysian Olympus rises, there doth lurk A stony hollow, thickly overgrown With arbutus and straight lentiscus shoots And ragged stone-pines: there land-turtles dwell, And bright innocuous snakes, and cruel boars. And by the Mysian shepherds thither led After most blythe reception, Atys stood, And Prince Adrastus and the Lydian band; And in the midst the boar at bay. The chace With all its wonted stirring circumstance Aroused the spirit of the Phrygian prince, And, with the power of old past times, relaxed Grief's pressure; and he hurled his lance With fierce unsteady eagerness, nor hit The raging boar: but youthful Atys fell. The brittle shoots of the lentiscus broke Beneath the fall, and to the naked sky The closing eyes of Atys were upturned. And in that stony hollow, which to-day The aromatic summer gently fills As calm as though no blood had been shed there, Rifling the placid beauty of the place, Was Atys, youthful Atys in his blood, Atys the beautiful, the flaxen-haired. There lay the hope of Crœsus; thither came The old King's Dream for its accomplishment. There is a cry in Sardis; Hermus hears: 'Tis not the clamor of the nuptial feast,— Atys is dead, they wail for Atys. Where Art thou, young bride of Atys? And the King— Where is King Crœsus? Who will dare to say Unto the King that Atys hath been slain, Atys, the beautiful, the flaxen-haired? He who went out at dawn, who marked the birds, Whose youth ran over with him, like a well, And when his spirits wearied him, he slept Beneath the plane, because his heart was light— Who saw the stars at midnight in the sky, Who looked into that hollow and knew not It was his grave—he is among the dead! O weep for Atys, Atys mid the dead! And Sardis wept for Atys. Crœsus called For vengeance on Adrastus, called on Zeus The god of expiations: he assailed The powers of Heaven with clamorous prayers, and filled The streets with imprecations, such alone As agony could wring from out the heart Of a bereaved and stricken parent. “Curse, “O curse the impious stranger, god of hearths! “O curse Adrastus, thou dread power who reign'st “O'er mortal friendship! curse me that dark man!” Slow the procession moves along the streets Of twilight Sardis. See! the white form comes,— Atys, the prince, returning to his home. King Crœsus gazed upon the slayer there, An apparition, wan as the cold corpse Upon the swaying bier: King Crœsus gazed, And he unprayed his curse, his passion sank, Sank down, and in his soul he pitied him; And beautiful and touching were his words, Albeit he then remembered with a pang How once Adrastus spake of the sweet hour When he should give back Atys to his arms: That hour had come;—it had no name in words! “Stranger!” (for by that title he addressed The prince, scarce knowing whether it enhanced Or lessened his mishap, that it befel By stranger's hand) “I will not seek to add “By word of mine to thine exceeding woe: “Nay, rather I would bid thee take good heart, “Although environed by calamity. “Adrastus! it was God who slew my son, “The holy God who warned me by the Dream. “Adrastus! it was God who by thy hand “Laid Atys low, and quelled King Crœsus' pride. “Wretched Adrastus! be consoled for this— “It was not thou, but God:—yet why by thee, “Yea, wherefore by thy hand, most rightly dear “For thy true princely heart, and for thy griefs?” Thus spoke King Crœsus most benignant words: For his whole mind was raised and magnified, Made merciful and quiet as a god's, By the extremity of mortal woe. Oh what a royal heart had that old man! Sardis remembered many a long, long year The funeral of Atys; how the King Hung o'er the motionless white frame, and wept And wept and spoke not, how the thrilling wail Of the young bride resounded on the plain Throughout the dim expanse, and how the prince, The rapt Adrastus, spoke not, did not seem To hear or see, but was as if he strove With some dull baffling mist within his soul. All gazed upon Adrastus; yet no eye In the whole crowd of Sardians had a look Of rage or hatred; for the King's great soul Had passed into his people. Midnight came: The glowing light of the red pile sunk down. Hermus, who had been troubled with the glare Of nuptial lamps, and with the smoke and sparks Of the dull wine-quenched pyre, now calmly ran Past the low fresh-turfed barrow where the bones And ashes lay. There were no feet of men, No Sardian lingering from the mournful crowd, Around the grave; but night, calm night was there. The silent darkness rested on the plain, By the swift rushing river undisturbed. Adrastus stood beside the mound in thought, The prince, the gentle heart, twice stained with blood. He knew that there was suffering on the earth; But he, yea, he was singled out from men For awful woe, bent, laden, trampled down, A gazing-stock for all posterities, His being brought beneath some special law Of the invisible world, so marked and sealed That he should not claim kindred with his kind. And in the darkness of his pagan faith The princely-hearted victim deemed he saw A right, uncensured, to self-sacrifice. Therefore he slew himself upon the grave; Not from despair, nor goaded by remorse, Nor to escape the dogging steps of fate; But, mastered by an instinct of deep love For earth and for his fellows, did he sit In judgment on himself, and, so condemned, With solemn self-collection did he slay Himself upon the barrow newly raised, That he might abrogate that fearful law Which had hung evil round him like a cloak. King Crœsus mourned for Atys two whole years Within his latticed halls: his pride was spent; And from that cloud of sorrow he emerged, With heart and eye chastised, a royal sage; And with a melancholy gentleness Of thought and aspiration so endowed, Men marvelled at the wisdom then outpoured From lips which learned their sole philosophy From suffering: such transfiguration wrought The love of God within the pagan's soul: And such the working of a heaven-sent dream To sanctify that ancient Lydian King. In early days I read this tale; it seemed Most touching and most wise, and it has lived Within my memory: in the simple Greek Of the old chronicler it truly is A stirring tale: perhaps less touching here, (Though English is a plaintive tongue) yet not Without pathetic wisdom of its kind. VI. THE SENSES. Rich soil of ancient springs! dear Earth! Of whom we all are made, In whose green treasure-house the birth Thou lentest must be laid! Mistress of Christian symbols, glowing In letters of dread meaning, In tides of song-like language flowing, Where minstrel ears are leaning, Where day and night Spell words of might By gloom or brightness hidden, And summer hours In bells of flowers Sing songs, and are not chidden. I never called thee gloomy,—never From out thy full, fresh-flowing river Have failed to draw sweet water, And still thine echo in me rings True to the faintest murmurings That constant stream hath brought her. So have I gazed on thee, as one Who sits from rise to set of sun In Troy's dim-furrowed plain, Scanning the letters half-effaced, And lines where some old Greek hath traced The titles of the slain. So strive I, as a baffled lover, The wondrous science to recover, Laid up in Eden still, When our wise father gave a name To every beast and bird that came, With heaven-imparted skill. All over doth this outer earth An inner earth infold, And sounds may reach us of its mirth Over its pales of gold. There spirits live, unwedded all From the shades and shapes they wore, Though still their printless footsteps fall By the hearths they loved before. We know them not, nor hear the sound They make in threading all around: Their office sweet and mighty prayer Float without echo through the air. Yet sometimes in unworldly places, Soft sorrow's twilight vales, We meet them with uncovered faces Outside their golden pales, Though dim, as they must ever be, Like ships far-off and out at sea, With the sun upon their sails. Not unobserved doth April bring, With rain-drops sparkling on her wing From many a silver shower, Her dewy prophecies of spring, Close leaf and show of blossoming, In every bank and bower. The breezes with their fertile wooing Earth's long-night fetters are undoing: And she within her priestly vest Takes back her soul into her breast. In every blossom there is fruit, And every flower swells at its root, Till stalk and lily blade are seen Piercing the mould with spikes of green. And jealous plants all sheathed and furled Come up with veils into the world, And brittle shoots, where June discloses Her jewelled lines of crimson roses. All these, ere winter's season hoary, Have had a blooming and a glory, Have left their glory, and were dead, That so they might be quickenèd. O faithless ones! that cannot bear Sharp pain or wan dejection, Come witness in the vernal air Earth's yearly resurrection! For what are we but winter roots, Wrapping in many folds our fruits, Which cannot ripen here? Our spirits from their mortal birth Spend only in the soil of earth One season of the year. I do not scorn our earthly life: It is a mystery, a strife, A crowd of marvellings; Our shadows, fashions, and degrees, Elsewhere have glowing substances, Which we may reach, when death shall please To give us back our wings. We have imprisoned by our sin Man's vast intelligences, And broken lights are flooded in Upon them by our senses. They are the inlets to our spirit, Ebbing, flowing ever From waters we shall once inherit In Heaven's upper river. They are the windows of our soul, From whence the captive gazes, And through them from the very pole, Sunlight and moonlight ever roll, While she her wild eye raises. She sitteth there a captive maiden, Upon the cold bars leaning, Until her bosom is dread-laden With all earth's lustrous meaning:— Sight's ether-wingèd visions seeing, Sound's golden circles hearing, With Touch dissolving space and being, And shades instead appearing. Languid with such access of joy, The soul herself betaketh To another sense of sweet alloy, Which earth, green earth awaketh. For what is Smell that wafteth by But the inward voice of memory? Forward or up she never leadeth, But household melancholy breedeth; Hindering with fragrant wiles our haste, With by-gone pleasures staying, Forbidding hearts such wealth to waste, Earth's backward call obeying, Waking the scent-embalmèd past With exquisite delaying. Dear Sense! and yet I dare not dream Thy spells which all so earthly seem Are only earth's creating, And have not from our Eden home To every several flowret come With breeze-like undulating. But Taste, the sense that feeds the spirit, Hath gifts ourselves could never merit, Impartings rich of heavenly mirth Brought out before its time on earth, Good things, good foretastes, angel-cheer, Presage of deathless might, That makes the soul her wings uprear, Like eagles in their flight. Sit, then, O Soul! thy Master praising, And through those windows keenly gazing, With awe thy vileness suiting; Through them the inner kingdom ranging, All things to spirit ever changing, Earth to heaven commuting. Dread Inlets! most mysterious Five! Linking our shadows with the skies, By whom dead forms are made alive, And symbols grow realities! And yet these Five may not be all:— This college-garden is but small With some few dozen trees; And yet scarce one was meant to grow, Where our long northern winters blow Within the English seas. This grew by some huge western river, This to the desert wind did quiver In Araby the Blest: Yon by the warm sea-shore might smile Away in some West-Indian isle, In lordlier foliage drest. Who would have dreamed in those south homes, Where icy winter never comes, That in the heart of tropic trees A hidden sense was moulded, To shield them from the piercing frost Of northern Europe's chilly coast, And be far off across the seas, Facing the rude Atlantic breeze, In centuries unfolded? Like powers in hearts of flesh reside, Like buried Senses there abide; Senses and Inlets fine, all over, Which our last rising may discover. Our bodies here may be the tomb Of powers and motions hidden, Which birth shall loosen from their womb Elsewhere when it is bidden: Fresh Taste and Sight, and other Hands Unformed,—for work of other lands; And secret Ears wherewith we may Perchance hear spirits speaking, And Scents to guide us on our way To the fadeless flowers we're seeking:— Verdure laid up in us, not wanted For the hours of mortal breath, Ready to bloom in us transplanted By the mystery of death. Thought hath a double stream, whose falls Keep murmuring in her sounding halls, Rising and sinking, faint and clear, As breezes waft their echoes near; One springs 'mid outward forms and shows, And winds as it is bidden; The other veils its wells, and flows In a woodland channel hidden; And at far times reveals its floods In whitest gleamings through the woods, O'er roots of marble breaking, Or in a hollow green and cool Through many a modest lingering pool Its amber waters taking. We have no spells to turn its flow, Or bid its voices come and go; For on its face are mirrored fair The lights and shapes that are elsewhere, And tranquil fear and shadowy love Brood o'er its basins from above. But oft in sudden turns of thought Both fountains are together brought, And mix their streams awhile; And fancy then herself is seating To catch the sounds and whispers fleeting, Where Heaven and Earth in streams are meeting, And rippling waters smile. Again in hours of gentle daring The soul hath traced the brook some way, Its darkly-twisting channel wearing, And coloured pebbles downward bearing From where its secret fountains play. Benighted in far woods, she sees Forms shift about among the trees, And vanish here and there, And, uttered by them in their fleetness, Soft voices of an earthly sweetness Keep trembling on the air. And then, when fancy's stars are waning, The soul her wonted home regaining, Yet still those mystic scenes retaining, The sounds and visions so impress Themselves upon her loneliness, With such a dimly-living power, That she in many an after-hour Beholds in strange and foreign places Familiar forms and household faces; As though erewhile in vision dread That place or room were visited, And strangers' voices echo round Like rings and links of magic sound. She listens well to what is spoken, As though the words were old; And watches for some random token, The wonder to unfold. These are the sounds and shadowy sight That came in waking dream, When she was wandering in the night Far up the heavenly stream. Oft too in slumber's pathless mountains The heart breaks up her ancient fountains, Which had for years been sealed, And the whole spirit overflows With waters that chance-dreams disclose In some forgotten field. Tree-top and rock, and nodding wood Group wildly in that whirling flood, While Earth and Heaven meet and part In giddy ebb and flow of heart:— Giddy, yet held by some strong tie Fast in the beating springs, Which up above in sympathy Keep time by murmurings. For that bright stream's mysterious powers, And all its secret going, Burst on the surface most in hours When sleep is o'er us flowing; Like gurgling wells and waterfalls Which, heard in stilly nights, Put music in the breezy calls That come from mountain heights. All these—quick turns of sparkling thought, Strange places known again, And dreams at hollow midnight brought, Are openings by these waters wrought, And Heaven awhile made plain. They who will listen at their soul, May hear deep down that current roll, Its waters sweetly timing; And patient ears that listen long May catch the fashion of its song, And science of its chiming. Nay, sometimes by its far faint airs Young hearts are taken unawares; As a stranger, sleeping on the mountains, Is waked by waters in their mirth, Making, as they tingle from their fountains, Audible music through the earth. This is the stream, the sacred Gift, By which our outward world we lift Into a world within, And, because earth is dull and dark, Where'er these waters drop, a spark Of upper light they win. And thus two worlds, two lives are ours, And men move on with angel powers, For angel graces staying; And earth becomes a pavement fair, Since deathless seeds are glowing there With a Christian inlaying. For this outward vest and this world we see With its green and its blue and white, With its folding-doors of day and night, Is the silent or voiceful mystery, That burns at the restless heart of a youth, As he wanders here and there for the truth; When all that he has and all that he knows And his spirit's fertile fountains Were absorbed in his childhood from the shows Of rivers and woods and mountains; When he communed little or none with books, Which are dead men's empty biers, That imprint on our features solemn looks But cannot draw our tears. The earth is a frail transparent vase With heavenly lamps behind, The light coming through is tinted, and draws Figures upon the mind. Thought's hidden stream from its upper springs Hath brought us a few interpretings. If the world would be still, our hearts might hear What the secret is, when the stream winds near. The earth is a church where no bells are rung, And her beauty is slighted for want of tongue; But the stream in ourselves is her voice brought back From Heaven where it was taken, That the minstrel spirit may have no lack Of dulcet sounds to waken. But a murmuring here and a murmuring there, And a half word falling on the air, Piece by piece we must weave in one, Till the words in music and rhythm run, And the poet must tell the meaning of all That obscure and beautiful ritual. So are we gifted; so we live, Scarce knowing what we are:— Deep-coloured flowers that feebly give Their scents unto the air. So are we gifted; so we die; We take our gifts with us: With the green lives that round us lie The way is ever thus. And so, when we rise from our chastening gloom, We are born afresh of a stainless womb, And the soul, that hath been like a wandering bride, Wanders no more, and is satisfied; For the likeness she wears was the secret thing That lured her on in her wandering. And joy and love to the spirit are given, New coloured and shaped in the moulds of Heaven; And our rising shall be like a wondering flower That looks on the earth in her summer power With the pride of its earliest opening hour,— A thing that may well surprisèd be With its own fair scent and bravery! VII. A WESTMORELAND HAMLET. I The rain hath ceased to weep upon the earth, The very hills put off their misty shroud; And evening cometh to her sunset birth Through gorgeous bars of black and orange cloud, While the late beams their lustrous looms may ply To weave and unweave rainbows in the sky. II Beneath this mountain terrace, at my feet Lies one of England's calm and green-field hollows, And a small village with its rain-washed street, And eaves beset with clouds of autumn swallows; And the full river with its radiant flowing Is like a harmless-natured serpent glowing. III The sounds, which from the cottages ascend Through the thin smoke that trembles up so lightly, With deep soul-soothing interchanges blend Toil's sweet fatigueand childhood's clamor sprightly, Where children, prisoned by the rain all day, Win their undreaming sleep in evening play. IV There fathers watch, well-pleased, with folded arms, And at the doors young mothers come and go, And age, in out-door chairs, doth borrow charms, More than it wots of, from that sunset glow, And youths unblamed their early beds may press O'ercome by labor's pleasant weariness. V The last gleam lingers on the hallowed ground, Where angels oft descend from realms of light, And now, with twilight's dreaded fence drawn round, The churchyard path is quiet for the night; Though many a matron opes her casement there, That she may breathe good dreams with churchyard air. VI O mighty are the gifts, and manifold The tides of moral health and strength that roll Through yon small street,—not to be bought or sold, But fresh from God in many a peasant soul, That might arise, and with meet aid from high, Buoy England up against her destiny! VII O England! England! wherefore so forswear The healthy powers that with resistless shock Bade fettered nations all their incense bear To thy few leagues of billow-beaten rock, And crowned thee empress on this ocean brow, Where, lulled by foreign winds, thou sleepest now? VIII Calm lies upon the hamlet,—calm and sleep: And, as I gaze on it, my pulses quicken, And echos seem from every bush to leap, Like the loud names that in our slumbers thicken,— Echos that come the autumn evening freighting With England's name in low reverberating. IX No boyish habit is my love for thee; For it came on with slow and conscious stealings, So that thy woods and waters now must be To me instead of passions and of feelings: Yet every month thy thoughtless ways are loading Dejected hearts like mine with dull foreboding. X Not banks of cloud upon the mountain stooping, Unmoved through ailing weeks of cheerless rain, Not want of letters when my soul is drooping For lack of love, and yet may not complain, Not these, so much as thy poor barrenness In all high thoughts and deeds, upon me press. XI If in a harbour on a sunny day, Foreseeing fate, thou mightest range the deck Of some good ship, that on her Indian way In one short week was doomed to midnight wreck,— Where rugged partings blend half-smiling fears With loves that play, like rainbows, among tears,— XII Oh! hath thy moral frame got nerves so strong To look with calmness into those clear faces, Setting their noisy sails with shout and song, To come no more unto their household places, But find, without church benison, a pillow On the salt sea's unconsecrated billow. XIII Such are the thoughts, my country! which I bear Close to my heart all day and night for thee, Drinking in life with thine imperial air Fraught with the healthy spirit of the sea, Haply mistaking motes that dim mine eye For shapes and shadowings of prophecy. XIV Not that I fear, as some, mechanic force, Which runs our life into another mould; Earth shall not see thought's wonder-working force Twisted aside by means for getting gold: These have no moral soul within them swelling, No spirit-pulse, no passionate indwelling. XV Great times are greatest in their ruins; these On after-years no giant shades may cast, Where flesh and soul may both dig palaces In the huge relics of a glorious past, As from the aqueducts Rome left behind, Types of the cumbrous beauty of her mind. XVI But I have fears, mayhap too hotly cherished, Of the dense towns, like storm-clouds, o'er the land, Killing the popular heart that had been nourished With fear and love, all chaste from nature's hand, Spurning the weight wherewith the green earth lies On peasant spirits with her mysteries. XVII And I have fears, lest quickened times should bring Guesses and notions, clothed in earnest dress, And men, from this reformed self-worshipping, Should make an idol of their earnestness, Counting unreal love of moral beauty Coin that may pass for simple-hearted duty. XVIII O that my tongue to such calm power were wrought, With life to kindle, sweetness to assuage Its own good fires,—to lodge some mighty thought Far in the soul of this self-praising age, Received into all England's wood and hill, A native echo, heard when strifes are still. XIX England hath need of harmless men, whose minds May draw to their own color every heart, Working in spots where angel help unbinds The chains that fetter noblest souls apart, That she might now, as erst, compacted be Within one spiritual Unity. VIII. ON REVISITING THE RIVER EDEN, IN WESTMORELAND, 1836. At night I heard the river's quiet sound Still flowing on o'er that enchanted ground As years ago it flowed: th' autumnal breeze Lay hushed within the dark-leaved alder-trees, And from unclouded skies the moon's cold beam Fell in a silver shower upon the stream; And oh! how fair, how heavenly fair the scene Caught through the leafy aisles and arches green, Where light and shade, most marvellously thrown, Rest on each giant tree and mossy stone! Soft—as the light that Faith doth shed around, Whene'er her pathway lies through holy ground; Dim—as the mist through which she loves to see But half-unveiled the lines of mystery; Glorious beyond expression—as the thought, The hour of death to saintly men hath brought! Ah! Memory wakes to feel at this lone hour Her own dear Eden's meekest, holiest power; How many a tale of other times she brings With her eternal, harp-like murmurings! How sad the thought that weary years are gone And the steep heights of virtue not yet won; Alas! how sharp the pang, how keen the sense Of vows forgotten, slighted penitence; And yet how cheering too the hope from heaven Of mercy there, and sin that is forgiven. Dear Eden! the retreats of this green wood Have heard the roar of many a winter flood, Since last I wandered here to while away The golden hours of schoolboy holiday: Thoughtful even then because of the excess Of boyhood's rich abounding happiness; And sad whene'er St. Stephen's curfew-bell Warned me to leave the spots I loved so well. Each hazel-copse, each greenly-tangled bower Is sacred to some well-remembered hour; Some quiet hour when Nature did her part, And worked her spell upon my childish heart. Ah! little deemed I then that thou couldst wind Thyself with such strange power into my mind. Sweet scene! thou art not changed since then!—the air, The trees, the fields, all are, as then they were, Happy and beautiful, like fairy-land Fresh born beneath the wild enchanter's wand. But hark! down Kirby vale the curfew knell— Then fare thee well, dear Eden, fare thee well! And may thine image, wildly-dashing river, Abide with me an household thing for ever. IX. THE KNIGHTS OF ST. JOHN. Oh, Memory!—as our boyish years roll by, How many a vision fades from Fancy's eye, How many a golden dream of days long past, And airy hopes, too fair, too bright to last! All, all are gone. The wild Arabian tale, Aladdin's lamp, and Sinbad's magic sail, These have no power to chain the listening ear, Or hush the soul in extasy of fear: Untenanted, unhaunted now, the hill, The lonely heath, the waving woods are still; Fairies no more beneath the moon's pale light Reveal their mystic dance to mortal sight; Each shadowy form grows dim; and we deplore A splendour that is seen on earth no more. Yes! It is Manhood's haughty right to quell Young fancy's fire, and break the darling spell, To strip the mind of all she valued most, And grant her poor return for what she lost. Land of Romance, Farewell! Yet though we part With these fond superstitions of the heart, Oh let us not in scornful wisdom deem These old memorials but a baseless dream, Mere phantoms idly raised to while away The lingering hours of some long summer's day. Far otherwise they think, who best may scan The powers at work within the heart of man. They know how heavenly pure the soul should be, Which fancy's gentle thraldom hath made free; They know how pensive thoughts may best arise To kindle nature's holiest sympathies, The deep affections of the breast to move, And call to life the strong, meek power of love. Visions like these float swiftly through the mind, Like the soft flowings of the voiceless wind. Have ye not seen the shadow-stains that glide On gleamy days along the mountain side, How they unveil in every green recess Strange, mingling scenes of power and loveliness, And then in stately pomp ride on? So too Imagination's gay, though transient, hue Discloses to the reason's inward eyes Somewhat of nature's depths and mysteries. And thus with you, fair forms of days gone by, Glories of Song, high feats of chivalry! Cold were the man whom tales of ladye-love And knightly prowess have no spell to move. Such were the strains that gushed like living fire From the wild chords of Ariosto's lyre; Or from that harp, alas! too soon unstrung, That to the Tweed's wild dashings sweetly rung, Whose mourning waves still softly bear along The dying echoes of her poet's song. Holiest of Knighthood's gallant sons were Ye, A sainted band, the Knights of Charity! 'Twas not an earthly guerdon that could move Your gentle Brotherhood to acts of love. Fame's silver star, and honour's dazzling meeds, And glory reaped in battle's daring deeds, These could not lure those hearts to mercy given, Who, poor on earth, were rich in hopes of Heaven. Yes! it was well in those dark days of old Europe should wonder, as her Pilgrims told How haughty warriors left the lordly hall For the rude cells of that poor Hospital, In the Hospital, the Knights wore a black vest, with a White Cross of eight points on the left breast. In the Camp, the White Cross on a red vest. And bade ambition's restless throbbings cease At the still watchword of the Prince of Peace: How along Salem's streets, in sable vest, The Silver Cross emblazoned on the breast, The lowly Brothers moved with hurried tread To tend the wayworn pilgrim's dying bed, And give, for Christ's dear Name, to that dim hour Religion's awful, consecrating power. Peace to that ruined City! peace to those Whose sainted ashes in her vaults repose! There, when the Arabian Prophet's countless throng Rolled, like an eastern locust-swarm, along, And blight came down upon the nations, there St. John's bright banner floated in the air, Curling its glossy folds against the sky, While clarions pealed, and pennons waved on high. One speechless look, one silent prayer to Heaven, And, hark! the Christian's battle-cry is given: The dauntless knights thrust back the advancing flood, And Siloa's brook runs red with Moslem blood. Alas, fair Salem! Piety may weep O'er the dark caverns where thy champions sleep. There stern disorder strews along the ground Fragments of elder, holier days around, And ruin rears aloft her ghastly form, Dim-shadowed in the blackness of the storm. No feathery nopal-tree, nor spreading palm Shed o'er thy hills their wildly-graceful charm. Few flowers are there, but round each falling tomb In scattered tufts bright orange-lilies bloom, Bursting from out their silvery, gauzelike sheath To smile in beauty o'er the shrines of death; And cedars crown the hills, a silent band, The only warders of thy wasted land; Thine only troubadour the southern breeze, Singing his quiet song among those ancient trees. Vainly for you, brave Knights, did Europe pour Her ardent bands upon that sacred shore. Vainly St. Loui's Oriflamme rode high In gleamy splendour on the eastern sky, Far in the swarthy vales, where ancient Nile Rolls his rich flood round many a lotus-isle. Too fruitful harvest of the Paynim lance, There lay thy chosen sons, unhappy France! Vainly did Edward lead the bannered host, While England's war-cry ran along the coast; The Saracens rolled on, and thousands fell Before the cohorts of the infidel, And bright above the eddying tide of war The conquering Crescent glittered from afar. Yet still, where carnage fiercest swept the field, The Crimson Vest, like lightning, shone revealed; Still, still they come, the Warrior-Brothers come, Where on the ruined altars of their home Are hung bright crowns of holiest martyrdom! That glory hath gone by! On Judah's shore The Christian soldier plants the Cross no more; And Acre's ramparts, wasted Ascalon, Mourn for the gallant Brothers of St. John. And sadly now, brave Knights, upon the seas Your fading banner droops, as though the breeze That wooed its silken folds to play, had come From the green hills that were that banner's home. There on his deck the silent Warrior stood Scanning with sternest gaze the heaving flood, As if to find in those dark depths below Some magic talisman to soothe his woe. He dared not eye the sunny land that lay In the blue distance many a mile away. The glory passed away; her icy hand Dark misbelief had laid on that dear land. Yet, faithful still, the western Pilgrim trod In pensive silence up the Mournful Road, And marked with fond affection's eager eye Where the Redeemer was led forth to die. Oh! was it strange in such an hour to feel A dim, a shadowy dread around him steal, (Not the unholy, restless fear that springs From out the bitterness of earthly things,) A hallowed dread, that lulls the soul to rest, And whispers peace and gladness to the breast. Shedding around our path, where'er we move, The deathless lustre of intensest love. If thou wouldst know how those fond pilgrims felt, When, weeping, at their Saviour's tomb they knelt, Go, seek some chancel where the moonbeams throw Their cold, chaste radiance on the tombs below, Where the world-wearied nun her vigil keeps, And at the lamp-lit altar prays and weeps: Go, mark her quivering lips, her streaming eyes Upraised in speechless fervour to the skies, And read that love, which words may not express, In the pale depth of their blue silentness. Far o'er the waves those gallant Warriors roam To win in other climes another home. Four years they fought, fair Rhodes, 'gainst leaguered powers, To plant their banner on thine ancient towers: They fought and conquered. On the Grecian seas In fearless triumph ride their argosies, Where erst the pirate-barques were wont to sweep In haughty lordship o'er the Lycian deep. No more the lone felucca seeks to glide Round the tall headlands on the summer tide, Or smoothly steals along from shore to shore, Charming the ear of night with muffled oar. But Moslem hatred sleeps not: that dark host, Flung like a weary billow on a coast, Gathers with angry sound. Ah! who shall tell What met thy gaze, thou lonely Sentinel, When, standing watchful on St. Stephen's hill, The City lay below thee, fair and still? In reddening streaks, that peaceful April morn, “In the end of April 1480, the grand armament entered the Lycian waters: and the Rhodian sentinel stationed on the summit of Mount St. Stephen, a hill two miles from the city, notified by signal that the Crescent was in sight.”—Sutherland's Achievements of the Knights of St. John, vol. ii. p. 9. Across the sea the first faint light was borne. The calm Ægean spread her breast of blue To skies of deeper yet, and lovelier hue, To Grecian skies! And there old Asia lay, Touched with the golden hand of early day; And wide beneath him stretched his native isle, Bright with an eastern spring-tide's magic smile. Meadows of flowering myrrh perfume the breeze That freshens o'er the bosom of the seas: And there yon forest's leafy depths entwine Their budding foliage round the Parian shrine; And delicate wild-roses too have thrown Their blushing chaplets round the chiselled stone In natural gracefulness; to morning's rays The laurel-rose her gaudy gem displays, Where the soft-rippling streamlet gently moves, Winding with quiet lapse among the groves. Beautiful Island! fair that morn wert thou, How passing fair in all thy ruin now! Lo! On the sea a thousand Crescents gleam, Glancing and flashing in the rising beam: And thickly gathering sounds come sweeping by Of war-cries fierce and maddening minstrelsy; And, wild and harsh, the cymbal-note is borne On the deep stillness of the breaking morn. Mohammed's galleys come! The Sentinel Rung from his lofty tower the larum bell, And, as its toll in startling accents spoke Of danger and of fear, the sleeping City woke! Then came the battle's din: the cannon's roar Was echoed back from Caramania's shore; And fearfully along that lovely sky Glared the red tempest of artillery. Dear was that triumph bought, Brave Chief, for thou, Peter d'Aubusson; Thirty-eighth Grand-master; called the Buckler of Christendom. When death came down upon thy laurelled brow, Didst in that hour with clear, prophetic eye, The gathering storm of eastern war descry: And, Rhodes, thy matrons might have spared the tear They shed so wildly o'er the old man's bier. They might have spared it for that bitter day When through thy shattered streets they took their way, And He, Solyman the Magnificent. the generous victor, wept to see The high-souled chieftain's peerless dignity, Villiers de l'Isle Adam; Forty-second Grand-master. Deeming a Christian had some magic power To bear him up in sorrow's darkest hour. Where were thy tears, wide Europe, when the blast Of Paynim war o'er that fair island passed? And where thy gratitude, when ocean bore That close-furled banner to the Latian shore? Was it for you it oft had waved on high, Decked in the crimson pride of victory? Alas! On far St. Elmo's castled steep, By whose low crags the waters never sleep, It hangs its sullen splendours o'er the deep; Far from that hill around whose rocky base The St. Elmo at Malta was so called from a hill of the same name at Rhodes. A hundred villas shine with eastern grace. No terraced vines, no lilied fields are here, Laughing in rich luxuriance all the year: No incense-breathing gardens freight the breeze That makes low music in the cypress trees: Ah no! the hot sirocco's withering breath Flings o'er yon hills the arid hue of death, And the fierce sun looks glaring from on high, As though a curse were in his broad, bright eye. His beams, like locusts, sweep the weary land, Or burn like flames upon the cloudless strand, While the tired eye explores the dazzling air, But seeks in vain—no grateful cloud is there. No sylvan groves, no hospitable shades Temper the ruthless noontide in their glades; Only the stiff carrubas there are found, Spots of black foliage on the tawny ground; While the long-trailing melons here and there Weave a green carpet o'er the surface bare, And the red cactus-blossoms, as they smile, Mock the scant verdure of the dusty isle. There like an eagle in her rocky bower, The gallant Order braved the Moslem power, While Europe echoed with their martial fame, And rung with La Valette's undying name. Alas! 'twas as a gleam of glory shed From stormy skies upon the mountain's head. That gleam is past; and England's pennon now Floats gaily o'er St. Elmo's castled brow. Beneath that guardian pennon, undismayed Wealth's busy votaries ply their peaceful trade, And church-bells fill with life the languid breeze That scarce can curl the hollow murmuring seas, While the white city, strong in faith and love, Looks on her azure inlets from above, And wraps old memories round her, like a spell, Of shipwrecked Paul who loved her land so well; Whom wild waves cast upon her barbarous shore, That Melita might serve false gods no more. Now, as night's silent footfall steals along, The Maltese boatman chants his even-song, Freighting with Mary's name the moonlit air That silvers many an old memorial there; And many a hospice, blanched and seamed with years, O'er the deep-shadowed streets its head uprears; And lowly wisdom loves to render yet The unavailing tribute of regret To an historic glory that hath set! Farewell, then, gentle Warriors! Once again 'Tis meet to raise the faintly-dying strain. 'Twas meet that when the pageantry of death Hung round the hero's tomb the laurel-wreath, 'Twas meet his minstrel-boy should linger near To weep alone upon his master's bier. And often to the Warrior's silent cell From a far land soft dreams shall come to dwell, While busy fancy marks with curious eye Tall helmet-plumes and bannered lines glance by, Or feeds her meditative soul from springs Of sunny thoughts and deep imaginings. Oh! still in memory's clear, pathetic light Shall live those dream-like forms for ever bright! Yes! while undying spirits still must crave A better, nobler land beyond the grave, In lowliness the feeling heart shall come And watch by the Crusader's marble tomb, Till the weird stillness of the cloistered air Steals o'er the soul, and charms it into prayer, And the strong-glancing, eagle eye of Faith, Sees far into the tranquil things of Death! X. HEIDELBERG CASTLE. Oh! if there be a spot upon the earth Where ruin hath more lightly laid her hand Than elsewhere, surely it is this fair place! Who ever saw decay more beautiful, Than when she holds her silent court as now Within the mouldering crypts of Heidelberg? Nay, one might think that Time himself were awed By such memorials of man's pomp and power, So that he walked with somewhat of a soft And reverential step, as we should tread Over the ashes of departed friends. Spirit of Desolation! Men may come To do thee homage in thy lone retreats, When broad-leaved summer hangs about the walls Her drapery of various green to hide The unseemly scars of time, and from the towers Gay flowering creepers fling their tendrils down For the soft summer winds to wanton with,— A banner bright as those that floated there Upon some pageant day in olden time. Yes, doubtless this would be a lovely place At such a season,—when the tufted pinks And scented wallflowers cling to every stone, And when the narrow mountain-paths appear Winding through vineyards, rich with purple grapes. Yet that is not the season when the power Of Desolation is most deeply felt. No; winter hath a beauty of its own, And more in harmony with spots like these. The summer loves not silence: her great charm Is in the concourse of a thousand sounds:— The birds, the winds, the very earth herself Breathing with life at every bursting pore, And that low ringing melody that comes I know not whence or how, except it be From things inanimate;—so all unlike To winter's tranquil and unbroken hush, When frosts have locked the trickling well-springs up In the earth's caverns, and the winds are furled Within the bosom of the brooding storm. There is a deep embrasure in the hall Wherein I sat, so buried and absorbed In thought, I almost seemed to have become Part of the spirit of that lonely place. It passed upon me like a dreamy spell, And viewless as the air that clothes the earth. About the Castle stood the shaggy hills, Hung round with dark and uncouth legends,—such As feed great minds, and are themselves the mind Of a great nation; and amongst the woods Young boys and little maidens went about, Stripping the glossy ivy from the trees, To hang as Christmas garlands round their doors. Far off, a group of charcoal burners stood, And from their fire the constant smoke went up In curls of faintest blue,—how silently! And ever and anon the chattering jay With his rude note awoke the slumbering woods, Displacing the sweet stillness that was there. But then the silence came again, and grew Far more intense—with now and then a pause,— When an old fount, that fell with splashing sound On the green stones below the Castle wall, Smote on my ear; a sound most desolate, And dreary as a tune that comes to mind In some lone bower where those we've loved and lost Were wont to be, and now can be no more! All these things came upon me with a shock, Yet wherefore it were hard to say, when all So silent were, and so supremely calm,— Yet did they come upon me like a sound That breaks on silence unawares, a shock Unsettling many most familiar thoughts, And feelings that were household in my heart. I was as one who dimly felt his way Among great truths and perilous mysteries, To whom the knowledge of deep things did seem About to be revealed,—the mighty powers With which the air is all impregnated, And the great earth, and the far-rolling sea, And the unquiet intellect of man; That something which is like the lightning-fire That leaps and lives within the thundercloud, And is its fiery soul, and drives it on In fierce career against the wind! Then came That desperate, sickening pang of impotence, Which cannot grasp the truth that it hath touched, As if that touch had paralyzed its hand. But quick a sense of exultation rose, And an ethereal buoyancy that thrilled My very soul, and lightened all my life Of that which weighed it down, and lifted me Far up upon the wings of power. I saw The mighty truth that I would fain possess Fixed in a region above all things else, And in that region did I seem to walk. Oh! it was like a distant city seen All lying in a bath of beauteous light, Within the heart of a rich golden haze, Cheating the evening traveller's anxious eye Of many a mile of weary distance—when The sun goes down, and all is gloom again. O wherefore have these tranquil images Of deepest winter, with its drear expanse Of brooding silence, wrought within my soul So hotly and unquietly? For who Would e'er have dreamed that such profound repose, Snow-buried, wind-less, desolate, and cold, Was but a gate to the invisible world, An unexpected outlet to the land Of inmost thought, which men so seldom reach, Whose truths appear unspeakably to shun The chains of words, and even to elude The outlines of material images? O Mother Earth! how near thou art to Heaven! For matter lies for ever in the lap Of spirit, and their subtle boundaries Fade, and revive, and quiver like the light, In most intelligent confusion, now Efface, and now repaint themselves again, Repose one moment in distinctness, then Gleam like the infinite without an edge, And melt within the furnace-fires of thought, Seen, yet unseen, now glowing on the eye, And now withdrawn in an excess of light Deeper than darkness. So these limits seem, Dividing realms so opposite, and spheres Which underlie each other,—rugged cliffs That crumble at a touch, yet from whose heights, As from the undiscovered end of space, Men fall at once into some other world, Some new and unimaginable life;— Walls that man knocks against and knocks in vain, And yet so imperceptibly confused That all seems smooth as summer lake between,— Matter and spirit pressing on each other, Stealing or borrowing each the other's place, With sweet encroachments, now as calm and slow As the white flush of dawn, now shooting swift Like the cold arrows of the boreal fire That climb half heaven at once in rosy flight, Or mingling unconsumingly in depths Of flickering splendours, volatile as are The vivid hues at eve exhaled in space Out of the speechless throbbing sunsets. Thus Mind hath a space, a medium of its own, Room for itself, more intimate and near, More vast and more accessible, than that Through which material worlds must plough their way Not unresisted; and the softest scenes, Fair forms, faint sounds, and fickle airy hues, The play of light, the splash of waters, pomps Of rolling clouds that creak not, and the blank Of midnight's unreverberating ear, The strain of silence listening for a sound, The patterns of the moonlight on the grass, The undulations of sweet scents,—all these Give way, like snow-drifts, 'neath the weight of thought, And let us down through the material world, As if it were a veil of thinnest silk, Into an inner world, whose fantasies Are few in number, dwelling far apart, Alone, in couples, or like nomad tribes Upon the roomy steppe, and where all thoughts Are colourless, without terrestrial shapes, And with an influence like creative words, So that each thought is word and work at once, Substantial, permanent, and giant-like, Widening the mind, transfiguring the will, And taking down the frightened faculties To that deep point in self, where God vouchsafes To confine on our thoughts, and touch our souls. It struck the hour of noon: the quiet sound Came muffled through the fleecy folds of mist, That thickly hung upon the town below. So faint was it and soft—yet so distinct— It seemed the spirit of a sound, escaped From some more gross and heavy atmosphere. XI. THE ISIS. I Early one twilight morn I sought A favourite woodland shade, A place where out of idleness Some profit might be made. II The voices of the little birds Were musical and loud, Buried among the twinkling leaves, A merry, merry crowd. III But when the gallant sun rode up Into his own broad sky, The very wood itself did seem Alive with melody. IV And there the golden city lay Safe in her leafy nest, And softly on her clustering towers The blush of dawn did rest. V Onward for many and many a mile, Through fields that lay below, Old Isis, with his glassy stream, Came pleasantly and slow. VI The spring with blossoms rich and fair Had fringed the river's edge,— Pale Mayflowers, and wild hyacinths, And spears of tall green sedge. VII The ripple on the flowery marge A pleasant sound did yield, And pleasant was the wind that waved The long grass in the field. VIII And there is something in a stream That fascinates the eye, A charm in that eternal flow That ever glideth by. IX For still by river sides the hours Will often lapse away, Till evening almost seems to steal A march upon the day. X So should it be with Man's career: Each hour a duty find, And not a stone be there to check The current of the mind. XI The path of duty, like the stream, Hath flowers that round it bloom, The thicker and the lovelier The nearer to the tomb. XII And, ah! the best and purest life Is that which passes slow, And yet withal so evenly We do not feel it go. XII. HOPE. I How much they wrong thee, gentle Hope! who say That thou art light of heart, and bright of eye! Ah! no,—thou wert not hope, if thou wert gay: She hath no part with idle gaiety! II The gay think only of the passing hour, And the light mirth the flying moments yield; But thou dost come when days of darkness lower, And with the future dost the present gild. III Yes; thou, sweet Power! art Grief's twin-sister, given To walk with her the weary world around, Scattering, like dew, the fragrant balm of heaven, Where she hath left her freshly bleeding wound. IV Oh! often have I pictured thee in dreams, For thou wert always very dear to me; And never was I sad but sunny gleams Have visited my drooping heart from thee. V Yet words can scarce portray thy lovely face, As it hath shone on me at dead of night, Wreathed with a smile of calm and serious grace, Chaste as the moon's, as pensive, and as bright. VI When pity for the grief we would beguile, And the glad thought that we can render aid, Strive in the heart, and blend into a smile, 'Tis thou that makest sunshine out of shade. VII And on thy brow there sits eternally A look of deep, yet somewhat anxious bliss, With a wild light that nestles in thine eye, As though its home were not a world like this. XIII. ASH-WEDNESDAY. “And when he began to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me.” St. Matt. xiv. 30. I Lord! I am thine, thy little child; Though fiercely still within, and wild The fires of youth may burn; Oh be not angry if I weep, And dread these stormy waters deep,— Master! to Thee I turn. II And, if in zeal and forward haste, All rashly from the ship I passed, And tempted danger here, Too great for one so weak as me,— Yet, Lord, it was to come to Thee, Oh let me find Thee near! III Now in these days of dimness holy And spirit-searching melancholy, Strengthen my drooping heart: And let me stop each wayward sense In pure and secret abstinence, And from the world depart. IV The Church, my Mother, calls me on To follow Jesus, all alone, Across the desert lea; And wrestle with the Tempter there In vigils of incessant prayer, And with wild beasts to be. V And well I know, when weak and faint With weary days in fasting spent, I must lose sight of Him: And peevish thoughts and tempers ill The ardour of my breast will chill, And make my lamp burn dim. VI Then by the hour that saw me rest, Safe as a fledgling in his nest, Within the white robe's fold, And by the Cross that on my brow He signed,—the seal that devils know,— Jesus! Thy son uphold! VII But I will quell my doubts and fears, And on where holy Sinai rears Its form before my eyes, For I can see above its head A rim of growing glory spread, The light of Easter skies! XIV. EASTER COMMUNION. I The mystery of mysteries! Now let the pure in heart draw nigh, While every pulse is beating high With love and holy fear; For Christ hath risen at break of day, And bids us from the world away And haste to meet Him here. II The mystery of mysteries! The Angels and Archangels come On wings of light from out their home In ranks of glory wheeling: Our souls shall mix and blend with theirs, In loud thank-offerings and prayers, Before the Altar kneeling. III The mystery of mysteries! The souls that still in dimness dwell Deep in the Church invisible, From doubt and care remote,— They too shall keep the feast to-day, And to their cells, though far away, The hymn of joy shall float. IV The mystery of mysteries! Oh! far and wide through all the earth Emotions of unwonted mirth And feeling strange shall be; And secret sounds shall come and go, Harmonious as the throbbing flow Of the mysterious sea. V The mystery of mysteries! The dead and living shall be one, And thrills of fiery transport run With sweetest power through all; For one in heart and faith are we, And moulded one, our Head! through Thee, The Body Mystical! VI The mystery of mysteries! From east to west the world shall turn, And stay its busy feet to learn The musical vibration; While Saints and Angels high shall raise In one vast choir the hymn to praise The Feast of our Salvation. XV. THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES. “But yet the Son of Man when he cometh, shall He find, think you, faith on the earth?”—St. Luke xviii. 8. I The days of old were days of might In forms of greatness moulded, And flowers of Heaven grew on the earth Within the Church unfolded: For grace fell fast as summer dew, And saints to giant stature grew. II But one by one the gifts are gone That in the world abounded, When it within the Church's walls Was willingly surrounded; And weary nations scarce can bide The thrall of power unsanctified. III A blight hath passed upon the world, Her summer hath departed, The chill of age is on her sons, The cold and fearful-hearted; And sad, amid neglect and scorn, Our Mother sits and weeps forlorn. IV Narrow and narrower still each year The holy circle groweth, And what the end of all shall be Nor man nor Angel knoweth: And so we wait and watch in fear;— It may be that the Lord is near! XVI. OXFORD IN SPRING. “Templa quam dilecta!” I How gentle are the days that bring The promise of the faithful year, Sweet early pledges of the spring, Sweetest while winter still is near; Like thoughts in time of sorrow given, Filling the heart with glowing types of Heaven! II The little buds upon the thorn Are peeping from their pale green hood; Pink rows of almond-flowers adorn With many a gem the leafless wood, And gaily on the vernal breeze Dance the light tassels of the hazel-trees. III The early rose is blushing sweet In yonder sunny sheltered place, Where spring and winter seem to meet And blend with wild fantastic grace, And under skies of coldest blue The crocus fills her yellow cup with dew. IV The sun shines on the city walls, The meadows fair, and elmy woods, And o'er her gray and time-stained halls A quiet studious spirit broods. O when shall faith be free to come And find within these stately aisles a home? V Thy timeworn bounds a precinct give Where forms of ancient mould might stay, Enduring truths that would outlive The jarring systems of a day; And then with men of evil will How calmly mightst thou sit, and fearless still! IV For now, when all things round are bright, Those voiceless towers so tranquil seem, And yet so solemn in their might, A loving heart could almost deem That they themselves might conscious be That they were filled with immortality! XVII. OXFORD IN WINTER. I City of wildest sunsets, which do pile Their dark-red castles on that woody brow! Fair as thou art in summer's moonlight smile, There are a hundred cities fair as thou. But still with thee alone all seasons round Beauty and change in their own right abound. II Whole winter days swift rainy lights descend, Ride o'er the plain upon the swelling breeze, And in a momentary brightness blend Walls, towers, and flooded fields, and leafless trees: Lights of such glory as may not be seen In the deep northern vales and mountains green. III Coy city, that dost swathe thy summer self In willow lines and elmy avenue, Each Winter comes, and brings some hidden pelf, Buttress or Cross or gable out to view: While his thin sunlight frugal lustre sheds On the straight streams and yellow osier beds. IV But thy main glory is that winter wood, With its dead fern and holly's christmas green, And mosses pale, and trees that have not strewed Their withered leaves, which yet perchance are seen Struggling to reach the spring, as though for them New sap would rise from out the grateful stem. V A wood in winter is a goodly sight, With branch and trunk and whitely-withered weed: Chiefly a wood like this, where many a night In Stuart times the cavalier's fast steed Spurned the dry leaves through all the rustling copse, And waked the cushat in the oak-tree tops. VI O Bagley! thou art fair at break of day, When freshest incense breathes from waking flowers, Fair when the songless noon hath come to lay Her spell of sylvan silence on thy bowers; But night is thine enchantment, magic night, When all is vast, and strange, and dusky bright:— VII The winter night, when, as a welcome boon, Down giant stems the stealthy beams may glide, And the stray sheep lie sleeping in the moon, With their own fairy shadows at their side; While through the frosty night-air every tower In Abingdon and Oxford tolls the hour. VIII Yea, on a poet's word, good men should go, And up and down thy lurking valleys climb; Thy faded woodlands, thy fair withered show, Are sweet to see; and at cathedral time 'Tis sweet on some wild afternoon to hear, Far off, those loud complaining bells brought near. IX They may have sadness, too, whene'er the wind Keeps moaning here and there about the woods; And fear may track their homeward steps behind Along the moated path and reedy floods; For in the stream the moon's white image rides, And, as they change, she also changeth sides. X Why is it, city of all seasons! why— So few have homes where there are homes so fair? They come and go: it is thy destiny, Which for its very greatness thou must bear, To be a nation's heart, thou city dear! Sending the young blood from thee every year. XVIII. ST. MARY'S AT NIGHT. I Dear Mother! at whose angel-guarded shrine The faithful sought of old their daily Bread, How full thou art of impulses divine And memories deep and dread! II Steeped in the shades of night thou art unseen, All save thy fretted tower, and airy spire That travels upward to you blue serene, Like a mighty altar-fire; III For wavy streams of moonlight creep and move Through little arches and o'er sculptures rare, So lifelike one might deem that Angels love To come and cluster there. IV Oh! it is well that thou to us shouldst be Like the mysterious bush, engirt with flame, Yet unconsumed, as she that gifted thee With her high virgin name; V And like the Church, that hath for ages stood Within the world, and always been on fire; Albeit her hidden scent, like cedar-wood, Smells sweetest on the pyre. VI The city sleeps around thee, save the few That keep sad vigil, with their spirits bare, As Gideon's fleece, to catch the cold fresh dew That falls on midnight prayer. VII Why doth thy lonely tower tell forth the time, When men nor heed nor hear the warning sound? Why waste the solemn music of thy chime On hearts in slumber bound? VIII It is because thou art a church, to tell How fast the end of all things comes along, And, though men hear thee not, thy voice doth swell Each night more clear and strong: IX Content the few that watch should hear, and feel Secure their Mother doth not, cannot sleep; And, as they hear, the gracious dew doth steal Into their soul more deep. X Or some young heart, that hath been kept awake By chance or by his guardian Angel's skill, Some serious thoughts unto himself may take From sounds so dread and still. XI If there be none to hear, no hymn of praise, Or voice of prayer, to join thy chant be given, There is no sleep above, and thou mayest raise Thy patient chimes to Heaven. XIX. COLLEGE CHAPEL. A shady seat by some cool mossy spring, Where solemn trees close round, and make a gloom, And faint and earthy smells, as from a tomb, Unworldly thoughts and quiet wishes bring: Such hast thou been to me each morn and eve; Best loved when most thy call did interfere With schemes of toil or pleasure, that deceive And cheat young hearts; for then thou mad'st me feel The holy church more nigh, a thing to fear. Sometimes, all day with books, thoughts proud and wild Have risen, until I saw the sunbeams steal Through painted glass at evensong, and weave Their threefold tints upon the marble near, Faith, prayer, and love, the spirit of a child! XX. COLLEGE HALL. Still may the spirit of the ancient days Rest on our feasts, nor self-indulgence strive, Nor languid softness, to invade the rule, Manly, severe, and chaste—the hardy school Wherein our mighty fathers learnt to raise Their souls to Heaven, and virtue best could thrive. Still may the brazen Eagle, that of yore Our fathers placed in each scholastic Hall, Utter its words of wisdom, and recall Our thoughts to God, while some old Father's lore, Or Martyr's roll, may sober our repast, Blunting so gently sensual thoughts that rise E'en from God's gifts, and love, with downcast eyes, In silence grows, at feast as well as fast. XXI. COLLEGE GARDEN. Sacred to early morn and evening hours, Another chapel reared for other prayers, And full of gifts,—smells after noon-day showers, When bright-eyed birds look out from leafy bowers, And natural perfumes shed on midnight airs, And bells and old church-clocks and holy towers, All heavenly images that cluster round. The rose, and pink acacia, and green vine Over the fretted wall together twine, With creepers fair and many, woven up, When autumn comes, into a tapestry, Richly discoloured, and inlaid for me With golden thoughts, drunk from the dewy cup Of morns and evenings spent in that dear ground! XXII. COLLEGE LIBRARY. A churchyard with a cloister running round And quaint old effigies in act of prayer, And painted banners mouldering strangely there Where mitred prelates and grave doctors sleep, Memorials of a consecrated ground! Such is this antique room, a haunted place Where dead men's spirits come, and angels keep Long hours of watch with wings in silence furled. Early and late have I kept vigil here: And I have seen the moonlight shadows trace Dim glories on the missal's blue and gold, The work of my scholastic sires, that told Of quiet ages men call dark and drear, For Faith's soft light is darkness to the world. XXIII. 1. ABSENCE FROM OXFORD. Fair City! that so long hast been my home! When from thy quiet places I depart By far-off hills and river banks to roam, I bear thy name about upon my heart. City of glorious towers! whene'er I feel The world's rude coldness o'er my spirit steal, Then dost thou rise to view; thine elmy groves Vocal with hymns of praise, thine old grey halls, Where the wan sun of autumn sweetest falls, Yon hill-side wood the nightingale so loves, Thy rivers twain, of gentle foot, that pass, Fed from a hundred willow-girded wells, Through the rich meadowlands of long green grass, To the loud tunes of all thy convent-bells! XXIV.2. ABSENCE FROM OXFORD. Thus have I carried thee all England through, A resting-place for my world-wearied eye, The sunset spot in this dull evening sky, The streak of gold that bounds the twilight view! And I have felt far off in many an hour That absent city's soul-restraining power, Like scents from Eden freighted with a charm For tearful eyes and foreheads worn and pale. As he who dwells upon some moorland farm, Far in the windings of a mountain-vale, Feels that he is not lonely, when at even He journeys homeward from his toil, and sees The distant village from among the trees, Breathing its faint blue curls of smoke to heaven. XXV. THE BEGINNING OF TERM. Dear City! far in hollow hills, And kept awake by flooded rills, This night I hear the many feet That pace thy steeple-shadowed street, The tide of youth in merry going Beneath the college windows flowing: And strange, most strange it seems to me At such an hour far off to be. I miss the evening thronged with greeting, The tumult of the autumnal meeting, When every face is fresh of hue, As though its life began anew. I almost wonder not to hear Some chosen voices speaking near. My very hand the air doth grasp In pressure kind or burning clasp: While with a pleasant, solemn strain The chapel bell wakes up again. And still to my believing eyes St. Mary's shadow seems to rise, All gently cast o'er every sense With its old wonted influence, Wherewith it hallowed many a night My ramblings in the cold moonlight; And thrills of joy and thoughts of good Were deepened by its neighborhood. And is it well that I should stand Apart in this sweet mountain-land? Oh! is it well that I should be Away from cares that chasten me, Away from men whose pattern still Could shame me out of weak self-will, Away from warnings which could bless And nurture me in holiness? And is it not a wilful loss To be unburdened of a Cross? And in the life which I am living Is there no fountain of misgiving? Yet, ere I left, the path did seem Clear as a steady, shining beam; And to my vision there were leadings, And in my spirit there were pleadings, Which were impressed upon my sense As very seals of Providence. Ah! in a hundred little things, Like wavings of an Angel's wings, Far gleamy lights, dim beckonings, Methought it was in mercy given To trace the guiding thread of Heaven. But now my doubting spirit fails, And from past faults a mist exhales, Clouding the radiant track which showed, As then I deemed, the heavenly road. And every stone, whereon I thought Some lustrous token had been wrought, Some bright inscription, surely given For faith's interpreting from Heaven,— Though carved with broken letters still, Appears the work of past self-will. What did as Angel's foot-prints gleam, Unholy imitations seem; And signs, which have not changed, display Their characters another way, And every fact the mind can bring Confirms the new interpreting. Oh Brother! when thou fain wouldst range From place to place, from change to change, Take not for heavenly light the glow Self-will can o'er the prospect throw. Sin is a prophet, who can cast Unerring light upon the past, But on the future makes to shine False sparkles which appear divine. XXIV.CHRIST-CHURCH MEADOW. Ere Advent bells the Church are calling Her Bridegroom to discover, Or autumn's fast and silent falling Of her sere leaves is over, In joyous gloom and saddest mirth We turn our thronging thoughts from earth, And stay our pilgrim feet, Two days by Shrine and Porch to wait All Saints and Souls to celebrate With calmest honors meet. One day, the college chapel ended, And pagan books I put away In sign of Christian holy-day, And through the sunny streets I wended. I walked within a meadow, where The willow tops were burnished fair With cold November's windy gleams, And watched two green and earthy streams Along the white frost-beaded grass With their leaf-laden waters pass. And bright rose the towers Through the half-stripped bowers, And the sun on the windows danced: The churches looked white In the morning light, And the gilded crosses glanced. Methought as I gazed on yon holy pile, Statute and moulding and buttress bold Seemed pencilled with flame, and burning the while Like the shapes in a furnace of molten gold. As the fire sank down or glowed anew, The fretted stones of the fabric grew So thin that the eye might pierce them through, Till statue and moulding and buttress bold, And each well-known figure and carving old, Peeled off from their place in the turret hoar, Like the winter bark from a sycamore, And dropped away as the misty vest That morning strips from the mountain's breast: And as the earthly building fell, That was so old and strong, Clear glowed the Church Invisible Which had been veiled so long. And in the midst there rose a Mount, The greenest verdure showing; And from the summit many a fount In emerald streaks was flowing, And each within its mossy bed, Most like a soft and silver thread, In wavy curves was glowing. And gathered there about a Throne, Raised high upon a Cloven Stone, A crowd of worshippers there stood, Like sea-side sands for multitude. All were in snowy vests arrayed, All bore a green and juicy blade Fresh broken from the palm; All looked as though some powerful thought Had o'er a myriad features brought One fixed and breathing calm; As mountains in the starry blue, Quiet and waiting for the dew, With yielding line and softened hue Acknowledge midnight's balm. A light of sun and moonbeam blent Was o'er those myriads thrown, In steady radiance from the rent Within the Cloven Stone. From north and south, from land and sea, Came that transfigured company, And East and West together sate, As though they did expectant wait For some high ritual; So noiseless were they far and near, One might the emerald fountains hear In their moss-stifled fall. There rose a man from out the crowd, Heb. xi. v. 33. &amp; xii. to v. 7. Apoc. vii. 2. St. Matt. v. 1. Who chanted solemnly and loud A recitation of all woes, And agonies and mortal throes, And tortures dire By sword and fire, And bitter pains and monstrous things For torment used by savage kings; And still between each word there came A trumpet's brazen cry, And from the throng a loud acclaim Rung through the hollow sky. Then from the east an Angel flew, In snowy garb with fringe of blue, Numbers xv. 38. And in his arrowy flight he bore A wondrous Signet-Ring. And he charged other Angels four, Who then the green earth hovered o'er, And the dim ocean's shining shore, To hurt no living thing. And there, apart, he set a seal On the twelve tribes of Israel; But when he to the crowd advanced, The sun so full and brightly glanced Upon their glistening dress, And then they waved their palms on high With such a rending jubilant cry, And in one mighty press Around the man Together ran, While on the air upborne, A thousand skirts of waving white Gleamed like the flocks of cloudlets bright In sunny air at morn,— So that to me The sparkling pageant did but seem All like a whitely-flashing dream Of silver sea. But now all hushed and silent grown Within the mystic place, Prostrate before the Cloven Stone They lie upon their face. And, like still waters, from the rent A Voice, once heard on earth, was sent Unto the mountain side; Nine times It rose, nine times It fell, Nine times in blessing did It swell, And without echo died. Now through the wavy rings of fire Uprose the sweet transparent spire A visionary thing; Then mid the uncertain silvery flood Half vision and half building stood In the sunlight quivering; Then on the turrets' fretted face Each statue grew in its old place, And through some leafless branches near, I saw, with hand like burnished spear, The dial of the clock appear, And in a keen November gilding St. Mary's stood, an earthly building. Ah! thus at times on earth below The Church Invisible will glow Upon our mortal sight, And mid the rude and jangling strife The holy Altar's hidden life Breathes out in heavenly light. O doubting heart! if e'er in thee, Temptations against faith should be, Make thou this day a vow with me,— Never in keen-witted strife To ask or tell of Christian life; Nor strive to read in wordy war What should be seen in prayer from far, Or on its viewless mission sent Couched in some secret Sacrament. For empty forms, opaque and still, No mirthful light are giving, They wait for us of backward will The vessels of the Church to fill With true ascetic living. XXVII. ALL SAINTS' DAY. 1.THE GATHERING OF THE DEAD. The day is cloudy;—it should be so: And the clouds in flocks to the eastward go; For the world may not see the glory there, Where Christ and His Saints are met in the air. There is a stir among all things round, Like the shock of an earthquake underground, And there is music in the motion, As soft and deep as a summer ocean. All things that sleep awake to-day, For the Cross and the crown are won; The winds of spring Sweet songs may bring Through the half-unfolded leaves of May; But the breeze of spring Hath no such thing As the musical sounds that run Where the anthem note by God is given, And the Martyrs sing, And the Angels ring With the cymbals of highest Heaven. In Heaven above, and on earth beneath, In the holy place where dead men sleep, In the silent sepulchres of death, Where angels over the bodies keep Their cheerful watch till the second breath Into the Christian dust shall creep— In heights and depths and darkest caves, In the unlit green of the ocean waves— In fields where battles have been fought, Dungeons where murders have been wrought— The shock and the thrill of life have run: The reign of the Holy is begun! There is labour and unquietness In the very sands of the wilderness, In the place where rivers ran, Where the Simoom blast Hath fiercely past O'er the midnight caravan. From sea to sea, from shore to shore, Earth travails with her dead once more. In one long endless filing crowd, Apostles, Martyrs, Saints, have gone, Where behind yon screen of cloud The Master is upon His Throne! Only we are left alone!— Left in this waste and desert place, Far from our natural home; Left to complete our weary race, Until His Kingdom come. Alas for us that cannot be Among that shining company! But once a year with solemn hand The Church withdraws the veil, And there we see that other land, Far in the distance pale: While good church-bells are loudly ringing All on the earth below, And white-robed choirs with angels singing, Where stately organs blow: And up and down each holy street Faith hears the tread of viewless feet, Such as in Salem walked when He Had gotten Himself the victory. So be it ever year by year, Until the Judge Himself be here! 2.THE MIDDLE HOME. The Dead—the mighty, quiet Dead! Each in his moist and silent bed Hath laid him down to rest, While the freed spirit slowly fled Unto the Patriarch's breast. Perchance awhile it lingered near, As loth to quit its earthly bier, Until the funeral rite was done, And the Church closed upon her son. There is a place where spirits come, Beneath the shrine to live, A mystic place, a middle home, Which God to them doth give. What mortal fancy can disclose The secrets of their calm repose? It is a quietness more deep Than deadest swoon or heaviest sleep, A rest all full of waking dreams, Of magic sounds, and broken gleams, Outside the walls of heaven; So near, the Souls may hear the din Of thousand Angel choirs within, And some dear prospect too may win,— As, in the light of even, Long absent exiles may have seen The home, the woods, the orchards green, Wherein their childish time was spent, Ere on their pilgrimage they went; And, as they look upon the show, The thought of early love returns Unto the straining eye that burns With tears that age forbids to flow. It is a rest, yet torment dire, Repose within the lap of fire, Because it is God's will,— Another life of heavenly birth, Which men live quicker than on earth, Happy, resigned, and still: A pardoning Father's first caress, A glorious penal blessedness! There then outside the heavenly gate The souls beneath the Altar wait— The Altar whereon Christ was laid, True Meat for all the living made, And Shelter for the Dead! Their bodies are not yet like His, Their souls not strong enough for bliss, Or love unmixed with dread. They cannot brook the vision yet, Those radiant lights that never set; And so the Son of Man hath thrown His awful Veil o'er spirits lone. O'ershadowed by His Flesh they lie, S. Bernard, Serm. in Fest. Omn. Sanct. As though behind a charmèd screen, Hid from the piercing of the Eye That may not look on things unclean! Say, who are those that softly glide Each pure and saintly soul beside, Like Angels, only that they bear More thought and sadness in their air, As though some stain of earth did rest Its pensive weight upon their breast, And lodged a fearfulness within That could not rise from aught but sin? Nor ever on their silent face Doth gentle mirth leave any trace, Save when their downcast eye doth rest Upon the Symbol on their breast, Then are their features lit the while With something like an earthly smile, As though a thought were in their heart Which it were rudeness to impart. These are the righteous works of Faith, Wrought in the fight with Sin and Death— Dear shadows of each holy thing, The goodly fruits and flowers that spring From the rich Tree of Life; Alms-deeds, and praise, and vigils past In penitential prayer and fast, Boldness in faith, and wrongs forgiven, And self-denying toils for heaven, And gentleness in strife. These follow all the souls that come Unto their rest and middle home; And by their sides for ever stay To witness at the solemn day,— In fear as nigher still and nigher Through the thin veils of cleansing fire, They see the angels from above Descend upon their tasks of love The spirits to release, To bear them to that Vision bright, That throne in whose tremendous sight The soul shall find eternal light And everlasting peace. XVIII. THE STORM IS PAST. I The storm is past: the green hill-side Is streaked with evening gleams, Let out through rents in yon dark cloud, Day's last and loveliest beams. II Still clings the tempest's fleecy skirt Round Fairfield's hollow crest, Where glorious mists in many a fold Of wavy silver rest. III Deep imaged in the lake serene The shadowy mountains lie: Deeper than heaven itself the blue Of that unreal sky. IV Oh! soft falls evening on the heart With gnawing cares deprest, Feeding on all her quiet things,— A Sacrament of rest! V Sin-blighted though we are—yet still Upon our weary souls, Through hills and woods, through lakes and streams, A tide of glory rolls: VI A brimming tide from heaven that flows Of freshness and of power, And holy strength to nerve the heart For duty's sterner hour. XXIX. 'TIS WHEN WE SUFFER. I 'Tis when we suffer gentlest thoughts Within the bosom spring: Ah! who shall say that pain is not A most unselfish thing? II Long ere I knew thee, men had said That I must be thy friend, While thou by Itchin's grassy bank Thy summer hours did spend. III So it came natural to me To have thee for my brother: And more and more each passing day We grow into each other. IV And I have looked upon thee now With gaze so long and true, That all things near and round thee seem Touched with the selfsame hue. V My very love for thy dear sake Runs out on every side, And joys with liberal waste to find Its idols multiplied. VI To charm my pain, soft thoughts of thee Doth willing memory bring, Fragrant as is the leafy smell Of rain-washed woods in spring. VII Yes—thou hast thrown on me once more My boyhood's living glow, And tears and smiles and childish joys From their old fountains flow. VIII Unlike, and yet how like, two wills That mould so passing well, As waves that meet and make a calm Caught by each other's spell. IX Each by its brother's heart delays To learn its mystic motion, Blends as it listens, and forgets All the wild heaving ocean. X Old age, what is it but a name For burning love departed? We two shall be for ever boys, If we are loyal-hearted. XXX. THE HOLY ANGELS. I Angels and Thrones and holy Powers And Ministers of light— God's primal sons and mystic bands In various orders bright, And hidden Splendours wheeling round In circles infinite— II Celestial priests and seraph kings In links of glory twine: And Spirits of departed men In saintly lustre shine, With Angels dear that fold their wings Above the awful Shrine— III Chariots of living flame that fill The mountain's hollow side, Breezes that to the battle-field Over the forest ride, Spirits that from the Bridegroom come To wait upon the Bride— IV These are among us and around In earth and sea and air, At fast and feast and holy rite And lonely vigil prayer, Morning and noon and dead of night Crowding the heavenly stair. V In solemn hours and paths remote, Where worldly sounds are still, There comes to us from Spirits nigh A contact pure and chill, A touch that to the inmost sense Runs with unearthly thrill. VI Yet man will deem himself alone— That earth so fair and wide Was made for him to have unshared His glory and his pride, That he alone, supreme below, To Heaven should be allied. VII And wouldst thou grudge, poor selfish heart, To share thy lonely sway, And scorn the visitants that come On earth with thee to stay— The Beings meek and beautiful That follow on thy way? VIII There's many a lake to Heaven looks up With bright and earnest eye Upon the solitary tops Of mountains steep and high, And many a plant and flower that bloom Where man was never nigh. IX All day and night the lovely clouds In curious shapes are blending, And coloured lights through forest bewers Are every hour descending, Where none are by but Angel forms, God's glorious road attending. X Oh! well it is that they for love Of man's cold heart are weeping: And it shall please me, Lord! to think, While my dull eyes are sleeping, Angels for Thine eternal praise Eternal watch are keeping! XXXI.THE LIFE OF THE LIVING. The whole world lies beneath a spell— A charm of dreadest power— And life hath some new miracle Worked for it every hour. Hast thou ever been on a misty night In a deep and solemn dale, When the firs, like spirits, stand upright In a soft, transparent veil, While the moon with rings of muffled light Hath girdled her chariot pale? Hast thou ever sat on a mountain-brow When the sun was bright and the wind was low, And gazed on the groups of silent wood That hang by the brink of a crystal flood, When the wind starts up from his hidden lair, Like a thing refreshed by sleep, On the scene so summer-like and fair, And the quietness so deep? The far-off pass and the broken fell With a hoarse and hollow murmur swell As the giant rides along: He comes with sceptre bare to break The pageant mirrored in the lake; And the whole forest depths to shake With fury loud and strong. He hath bent the poplar as he past, As the tempest bends the tall ship-mast; He hath twisted the boughs of the lofty ash, And the old oak moaned beneath his lash. And yet to thee like some strange dream The wild winds savage sport doth seem, For thou art still on thy mountain brow, With the sun all bright and the wind all low! Ah! such at best is this weak life, A mournful and mysterious strife, Where each man to his neighbour seems Like the stirring forms in motley dreams; And shadows fall from cloudless skies, And lights in darkness gleam, And endless are the mysteries Of this unbroken dream. And we gaze as dreamers have done of yore On a sight they think they have seen before; And the far-off hills, and the neighbouring woods And the gleaming pools of the winding floods, Are blent in the sunset's misty hue, When color and distance are both untrue. To the eye of mortal it may not be To look on his own soul, But like a dim half-hidden sea Before him it doth roll. It is green as the green earth's sunny grass, It is blue as the bluest sky; It is black as night when the tempests pass, And the snow-white sea-birds cry. The weary billow hath no soft sleeps, For its colour and change are given Not from the heart of its beating deeps, But they fall from the face of heaven. When the day is fair, and the gale at sleep, There are marvellous things that lie Full many and many a fathom deep, Moving and resting uncertainly:— Things tinted, dark, and bright, Brave jewels seen Through the solid green, Gleaming and giving light. And after the storm, when the summer calm Drops down on the sea like a holy charm, When the clouds on high Float quietly, Like Angels winnowing by,— We see by the dawn that the furrowed shore With broken things is strewn all o'er, From the hollow ocean brought; Quaint carvéd works man never wrought, And plants earth never bore, New metals torn from their ancient bed, And the wave-bleached bones of the unknown dead. Can the beach that we scan Be the Soul of Man With the wrecks of its childhood's being— With the tokens dread That the life which is fled Is blent with the life that is fleeing? XXXII. THE MOUNTAINS. “Their gods are gods of the hills; therefore they have overcome us.”—III. Kings xx. 23. Let none but priests or lowly men draw nigh Unto the lofty mountains, to invade The awful sanctuary God hath built Upon their desert sides. There was a time, Ere the unholy stain of blood had flushed The sunny green of the young virgin earth, When He did walk with men in shady bowers And innocent gardens. But when sin grew bold, The jealous God withdrew unto the hills: And the bright mists that moved upon the plain, To gladden and keep fresh the heart of earth, Were gathered up to Him, and hung in folds Of glorious cloud before His mountain Throne; And everlasting barrenness was bid To take the hills unto itself, that He Might have a solitude wherein to dwell. Behold how He hath gifted this His stern And sacred dwelling-place. Tempests and storms And the mysterious voices of loud winds, A thousand lights of beauty, so intense They make men weep for love of them, and shades That move obedient to conceal from us The path of some dear Angel, and o'er all Bridges of rainbow thrown from peak to peak In mystic arches, signs of covenant:— These are His gifts unto the mighty hills. And the blue skies are bid by Him to stoop Unto the mountain-top, that earth may blend With Heaven; and alway from their cloven sides The music of ten thousand springs is heard, Gushing with water—holiest element, Wherein the power of our New Birth is laid: Fed ever from the dews of Heaven that fall When night is coldest; and free liberal airs That roam about the mountains, and that come We know not whence, move o'er the pool unseen, Like the pure Dove who broods above the Font. —Fresh are those sources, though no shade is nigh, Fresh as the wells that stand in natural rock In summer woods or violet-scented grove, With lowly flowers all round, and forest-breaths Just come to dimple their still surfaces, And now and then to scatter the frail leaves From off the briar-rose that hangs above. And here and there, far in the lonely glens, Huge memory-peopled forests stretch along; Amid whose glorious tangled aisles, and choirs Closed in with leafy pinnacles, and shafts Of tall light trees down which the sunbeam plays, Our holy sires were taught by God to build Their venerable Churches, so that He Might come once more from the eternal hills To dwell by shrines that mortal hands had reared, Albeit the pattern of the Holy Place Was shown them on the mountain's wooded side! On the high places of the Holy Church, Strongholds of prayer and lonely steeps of faith, Lay the first lights of hope, when all around Was dark and dreary tumult. Savage wastes Of black and angry waters rolled along. But the strong breath of Him who brooded once Upon the shapeless seas, closed up the skies And sealed the fountains of the bursting deep. When Noe from his single lattice gazed, The watery gleams of the returning sun Smiled sadly on the mountain-peaks that rose, Like islands of the Blest, happy and green. Unto a mountain-top by impulse drawn, On Ararat the weary Ark reposed, Safe anchored there within the rocky veil, Now muffled by long centuries of snow. Then were the shades dispelled, and earth was free, And Stars and Angels shouted round the Throne, And the victorious Sun broke from the East Into the sky, beneath a glorious arch Wreathed with triumphal colors, and the Earth Sent up a steam of odorous sacrifice Unto the Threefold Majesty in Heaven! These are the marvels that of right belong Unto the mountains. So it came to pass The children of the old dark faiths went up To worship there, and lit their altar fires Upon the even cone of some green hill, Whose very shape seemed pregnant to their eyes With an unwonted presence, or dim trace Of Him they sought. Alas! they little knew Whence their blind worship came, what Angel forms Went often with them to the bleak hill-tops. And so the spiritual Persian climbed The lofty steep, to feel his God diffused In the unbounded blue that was around, As though the mountain-wind, that did embrace Himself and all, had been the breath of God! Oh! come then to these gifted Altars, come! They will unteach thee pride, and gird thee round With types and mysteries of things above, And wrap thy spirit up in many a fold Of awful visions. Come and wander now Among their solemn passes, far withdrawn From every sound except the waterfall, And eagle's voice, high up among the clouds— Wondrous as that dread bird that waited once In Patmos, when the saintly exile saw The holy Church pass on from east to west, Like the bright moon, through shadows manifold. How fixed and calm they look! Yet on their sides, Whether by stream or flame impressed, fierce scars And rugged seams are left as if to tell Of revolutions past, upheaval slow, And secular subsidence, and deep grooves Worn by the ancient glacier on its road, Like furrows on brave faces made by pain, The lines of earth's old age. They make the hills Look old and hoary, and yet not the less Unchangeable: as if they meant to show That changes, which efface men's works and ways, Can only wear God's footprints deeper in,— For fire and flood are but His chariot-wheels. Behold the heights man's foot hath never trod! A cloud of prophecy hangs densely there. In ancient days the Spirit dwelt in hearts That knew His presence: in these later times Men prophesy, and know it not; they strew The precious treasure up and down, like leaves, And the wise winds, which are God's Spirit, take And gather them for Him,—they are not lost. Thus from all seers, both new and old, like clouds Drifting in little flocks on autumn days To one dark treasure-house of storm, each year The weight of prophecy doth grow, and men Behold its varying outline, bright and dark, And watch its swelling form with awe, as though It could no more contain the living fire Which hath already shone in palest gleams Through many a rent and at each radiant fringe. Come, then, unto the mountains—sit with me Among this spotted fern; for God's decrees Are wrapped about them like a mantle: they, Whom He foreknew, perchance may lift the veil, And see His depths within the blessed light Which kindles love and yet doth not increase Our knowledge. Come, then, to this trickling spring, It will remind thee of thy morning dew. Let the huge mountains throw their rugged arms Around thee, while their virtue goeth out Into thy heart with hidden sacraments! XXXIII. THE PIC-NIC. I A lady a party of pleasure made, And she planned her scheme right well; And early and late this party filled The head of the demoiselle. II It rained all day and it rained all night, It rained when morning broke, It rained when the maiden went to sleep, And it rained when she awoke. III Peevish and fretful the maiden grew When the hour of noon was gone; But the merry clouds knew nothing of that, And the rain kept pouring on. IV The weather has got no business with us, And we have none with the weather, And temper and weather are different things, But they always go together. V Oh! anger and beauty, my lady dear, Will never agree to share That little white brow that lifts its arch Through the parting of thy hair. VI The mists are strewn all over the hills, And the valleys are ringing with floods, And the heavy drops on the flat broad leaves Are making strange sounds in the woods. VII Angels are round thee and Heaven's above, And thy soul is alive within; Shall a rainy day and a cloudy sky Make a Christian heart to sin? VIII O wait for the sunset's dusky gold On the side of yon mountain glen, And seek the lone seat where the foxgloves grow, And smile at thy folly then. XXXIV. MY GODSON'S BAPTISM. I Dear Christian child! was it the power That in those gifted waters came, Which stirred thee at that solemn hour, And thrilled through all thy trembling frame? II Oh! was it keen and fierce the smart When the old root within thee died, And the new nature in thy heart Rose like the swell of Ocean's tide? III Yes—in the dawn of thy new birth There came some spiritual fears, Faint gleams of after-things,—that earth Might pay the first-fruits of her tears. IV Sweet penitent! all lovely things Are for their brightness full of fear; And strange would seem those angel-wings That came and made soft motions near. V And yet the Cross did hush thy cries, When thou within mine arms didst lie, Quiet and sealed for sacrifice Unto the Holy Trinity. VI And such a smile sat on thy mouth, While from that Token's fourfold might, From East and West, from North and South, Great visions broke upon thy sight. VII And such a look came from thine eyes Through lashes fringed with Christian dew— Wonder and hope and mirth did rise Up from those wells of heavenly blue. VIII Now thou art consecrate, fair thing! A Church where sinners have not prayed, A shrine where only Angels sing, Another stone in Sion laid! XXXV.BIRTH-DAY THOUGHTS. June 28, 1838. THE FEAST OF ST. IRENÆUS. THE VIGIL OF ST. PETER. THE CORONATION OF QUEEN VICTORIA. I It was a day of mingled joys and fears Blending like light and shade, And boyish smiles with lingering sweetness played Through penitential tears. II It was a feast whereon soft memories Of an old saint do stay,— Of one who came bearing the cross this way From his own eastern skies. III It was the eve of a high festival— A day of serious hours, For grief that one all full of gifts and powers So faithlessly should fall. IV It was the day whereon a Sovereign knelt Before the King on high, And through the realm was heard one loyal cry, One beating heart was felt. V And thoughtful men were startled at the sound, And good men fell to prayer, For with the glory and the pageant rare Shadows were gathering round. VI There is a well, a willow-shaded spot, Cool in the noontide gleam, With rushes nodding in the little stream, And blue forget-me-not VII Set in thick tufts along the bushy marge, With big bright eyes of gold, Where glorious water-plants, like fans, unfold Their blossoms strange and large. VIII That wandering boy, young Hylas, did not find Beauties so rich and rare, Where swallow-wort and pale bright maiden's hair And dog-grass greenly twined. IX A sloping bank ran round it like a crown, Whereon a purple cloud Of dark wild hyacinths, a fairy crowd, Had settled softly down. X And dreamy sounds of never-ending bells From a city's ancient towers Came down the stream, and went among the flowers And died in little swells. XI There did I keep my birth-day feast, with all These gentle things around, While their soft voices rising from the ground Unto my heart did call. XII It is not good to be without a home,— Young hearts should not be free: Yet household thoughts have long been closed to me Within my father's tomb. XIII And I have roamed through places fair and good, Like a wild bird that drops To rest somewhere among the thousand tops Of a broad fir-wood. XIV My love hath strewn in many a youthful breast Fancies of tender mould, And I have memories lodged among the old In their eternal rest. XV Sunny and bright all earthly glories seem, Like an enchanter's show, And yet it frets me all the while to know That this is but a dream. XVI I cannot burst the fetters of the spell:— The silvery light of mirth Streams from within me over all the earth, As from an endless well. XVII So bright of late the unsetting sun hath played, Its evening must be near, When Hope shall win fresh loveliness from fear, And Memory from the shade. XVIII Still by old hills or abbey's ruined shrine Shall love my footsteps bring— Dear homes, where friendship set me gathering These wild-flower thoughts of mine. XXXVI.BIRTHDAY THOUGHTS, At a Grave in Somersetshire, 1839. If in the years of my most wandering youth Some few untended plants have learned to flower, Thine was the mercy, Lord! and Thine the power That sowed and kept alive the seeds of Truth. Father and earthly mother I have none, Sweet bride nor marriage-home, nor children here, Nor looks of love—but Thine, my Saviour dear! And my young heart bears ill to live alone. So to the wild and weedy grave I come Of this meek man of heart, who bore the Cross, Hid in a lordly crosier, to his home, And for Thy love did count all else but loss. Long as my life may be, teach me like him To follow Thee by pathways lone and dim. Better they should be lonely—better far The world should be all dark; so through the night, And with fresh tears to multiply the light, Mine eyes might see Thy pale and single star. Yet, Lord! 'tis hard when evening shadows come, To have no sight or sound of earthly cheer: Still were my faith but strong, Thou wouldst be near, And I in my pure thoughts might find a home: And memory too might hear her dead loves pour, Soft as the songs of some shy hidden bird From the low fields or woodlands nightly heard, Sweet peaceful music on the evening hour.— O shame on me to fear the Cross should press Too hard in firm and thoughtful loneliness! XXXVII.A LESSON FROM THE FERNS. I Dear Friend! I have a dread and glorious home, Just where two inland rivers gently meet, And the young Cherwell's haunted waters come, Isis, their queen, to greet. II Far in the woodland heart of this green isle To their own banks those streams are tinkling now, Where many an ancient church and gorgeous pile Throng in to hear them flow. III But I have yet another home as fair, Though my sweet southern streams are far away, And two wild mountain rills are meeting there As musical as they. IV And are there not Church thoughts and feelings here, Scattered, like flowers, on Loughrigg's sunny side, And hopes to bless and memories to cheer Where Rothay's waters glide? V Yes—by a hundred streamlets' wayward turns My heart hath spent some hours of Sunday rest, And watched those pastoral things the young green ferns, Unbend from earth's cold breast. VI Oh! for thine own dear sake those things shall be Marvellous types and symbols of my vow, And with their lessons dread soft love for thee Shall mingle fondly now. VII Often shall they in hours of pensive thought Give up the secret charms that in them lie, And all thy sacred image shall be brought To fancy's yearning eye: VIII The light, the power, the unsettled fires that play Among the sleepless glancings of thine eyes, Thy thoughts and things of beauty, which betray The heart from whence they rise. IX If in thy spring the gems of Heaven be set, Like spotted fern-flowers in their first pale green, Oh! shade them from the too bright world, nor let Their fragile bloom be seen. X So shall the gifted suns of summer-tide Their hidden power and loveliness unfold, And he, that loves thee, with a lawful pride, Shall mark their autumn gold! XXXVIII. A DREAM AFTER AN ARGUMENT WITH A FRIEND. I left thee when the midnight bell had tolled, Full of fresh views and reasons: in thine eyes All night perpetual meanings did unfold Quick turns of thought and kindling sympathies. Still those blue eyes looked at me through my sleep, Changed by the power of dreams to fearful things. They bore me far away, where evening flings Her gorgeous blue on Atlas: they did sweep Into the bluer sky, where comets blaze, And golden creatures live in starry rays. Onward they went where filmy mist-wreaths creep About the rolling moon; and fell with me In the translucent caverns of the sea, Where sunset takes the ghosts of sunken days. XXXIX. Keswick, August 3, 1838. I knew three sisters, who by haunted rills And hill-side places gathered rarest flowers; But, when apart, and in their lonely hours, The brightest things that bloomed upon the hills Were dull: for love alone the spell hath given Unto the green of earth, the blue of heaven! It is the law for all: few men can think Save in another's heart: yea, few can drink Of their own fountains but in others' eyes, When they can see themselves reflected there With an ideal beauty; and can rise, Like a freed slave, with spirit keen and bare From the damp cells and weary bonds of sin, Which, but for love, would fetter them within. XL. Keswick, August 3, 1838. Some fall in love with voices, some with eyes, Some men are linked together by a tear; Others by smiles; many who cannot tell What time the spirit passed who left the spell. It comes to us among the winds that rise Scattering their gifts on all things far and near. The fields of unripe corn, the mountain lake, And the great-hearted sea—all objects take Their glory and their witchery from winds: All save the few black pools the woodman finds Far in the depths of some unsunny place, Which stand, albeit the happy winds are out In all the tossing branches round about, As silent and as fearful as a dead man's face. XLI. CASTLE-HILL, KESWICK. “We put the sun to bed with our talk.” Greek Anthology. I Come let us gather here upon the hill The noble hearts that yet beat pure and high, And, while the lake beneath our feet is still, Sweetly our speech may run on chivalry, And feats of arms, and old crusading days, And tourneys bright, and minstrel's generous praise. II For we have mourned o'er many a lonely place And moorland village with a knightly name, And we have loved with wise regrets to trace The still unfaded relics of their fame. Yon sun that sinks o'er Solway's distant bay Sets not more proud and glorious than they. III Oh, then, while round Blencathra's haunted crest The purple folds of summer twilight wind, Spirits of feudal memory here shall rest With spells of dearest awe upon my mind; And there shall ride full gallantly and fast Pageants and shades of that romantic past! IV Sweet to the brow the wind of evening blows, Sweet to the sight are evening's golden gleams, Sweetest of all are they where Greta flows, And Glenderaterra, and the nameless streams, Lonely and beautiful, where summer day Fades o'er yon Cumbrian mountain far away. V The clouds that build wild structures up on high Shall mould themselves to some baronial hall, And the stray mist that wanders loosely by Be changed to a gigantic seneschal; The wind that o'er the battlements doth float Shall sound from thence an elfin warder's note. VI But, when the last pale glow is on the heights, The dream may shift unto a maiden's bower, Where every lattice shines with festal lights, And crimson pennons wave on every tower, Where ladies welcome back their knights again From the far hunting-field or battle-plain. VII And by my side the page of Monstrelet With all its lifelike forms shall be unrolled, And he, with eye undimmed and hair of gray, The chivalrous old Canon, shall unfold, As in my boyish hours, his own dear lore, Bright with the tints that shone in times of yore. VIII Oh, in his boyhood's best and purest days Who hath not gathered round old Froissart's knee Like children round a father, in whose lays Strange things were told with quaint and earnest glee, Prizing each year his well-known strains the more, When we have heard them ten-times told before? IX Come, then, and we will make a mimic tale:— The store of legendary things that lie Far in the woods of many a Cumbrian vale Shall weave for us the mingled destiny Of a young knight and of a templar bold, In those most gorgeous Chronicles untold. XLII. FURNESS ABBEY. Ah, Sydney!—as we journeyed toward the main, Visions of old Byzantium worked in thee; Thy talk was of the gorgeous Osmanli:— O how it rose like a bewildering strain Of oriental music—paused again— And changed unto the savage glens of pine Which cradled thee! and yet the twilight power Of English scenes, most felt at that still hour, Some words of dearest rapture then could win, As we walked forth by Leven's tranquil side. Now, as thy hand is fondly clasped in mine In this Cistercian chapter-house, the pride Of native things awakes unblamed—the tide Of English blood is rising fast within. XLIII.ON THE HEIGHTS NEAR DEVOKE WATER. August 7, 1838. Dreary and grey the twilight hour came on, Duddon was sounding in his wooded vale; And through the ferns and round each hollow stone The spirit of the chill night-breeze did wail. With low and piteous moaning did it swell, Like a poor ghost, upon the shaggy fell— When, as we rode, the sun came round and stood On the hill-top—an altar all of gold: Twisting in gorgeous coils, like a huge flood, The crimson steam along the valley rolled. Rain-drops, like gems, upon the heath were seen, And the whole earth was hid in golden green, O it was well our hearts within us quailed,— The throne of the Eternal was unveiled! XLIV.THE GROVES OF PENSHURST. The groves of Penshurst are a haunted place; There is a spirit and a presence there Of one departed; and the brooding air Is charged with powers of old ancestral grace. Thou art a worthy son of that great sire: Though there be doubt and peril, while the fire Of youth burns in thee! Let the cherished dread Of that most knightly-hearted Sydney rest, Like a dear master's hand upon thy breast. Brother! great minds are built, great souls are fed In steadfast discipline and silent fear. When from this rule thine impulse would depart, A voice from Sydney's tomb shall whisper near, And ring wild trumpet-notes within thy heart! XLV. THE ICONOCLAST. Whence comes this sinking heart, these failing powers? Something hath touched my thoughts: they have no life, And stir, like sickly things, in idle strife, And I am restless all these midnight hours. Friend! thou hast done it: thou hast broken down All mine old images, and didst uncrown The glorious things that reigned within my heart, Because thou art more glorious. Times like these, When our whole Past is roughly set apart, Leave the soul full of love, yet ill at ease. Yon pictured skies the sunset breeze is shaking From the still lake are stabler types of Heaven, Than the brief friendships whose loud pledge was given Mid the wild sport of moral image-breaking. XLVI. THREE HAPPY DAYS. I Three happy days we had been out Among the awful hills, Learning their secrets by the sides Of dark, untrodden rills. II We had companions all the day— Rainbows and silver gleams; And quiet rivers all the night To mingle with our dreams. III We spoke of great and solemn things, Like earnest-minded men, And often rode unheedingly Through many a wooded glen. IV We talked about the early Church, Her martyrs keen and bold, And what perchance might now befall The same dear Church grown old. V We went into each other's hearts, And rifled all the treasure That books and thinking had laid up In academic leisure. VI And now we are so wearied out With all this high debate, We have not mentioned once to-night The name of Church or State. VII With sweet revenge the silver meres We slighted on our ride, With shadowy trees all glassed therein, Rise in us like a tide. VIII Ah who could see us sitting thus, Yon mill-stream falling nigh, And yet gainsay the soothing bliss Of silent company? XLVII.STERN FRIEND. Stern Friend! with what a passionate eloquence And deep voice thou didst plead, Till thy words cut like knives, through every sense, Making my heart to bleed! The spirit of old times went from thee there, As lightning bold and keen, And still unhealed the seams and furrows, where That lightning passed, are seen. Alas! it was a most unworthy dream That with my youth had grown,— An earthly lure with a false winning gleam Of Heaven about it thrown. 'Twas a brave thought to think that thou couldst tear The idol from its shrine, And rear a nobler, heavenlier image there Than that old dream of mine. Still, as thy hurried gesture waxed more fierce, My thoughts drew further in, Shrinking from that quick eye which seemed to pierce The last thin veil of sin. I watched thee like an abject, guilty thing, And wept with shame and fear, Whilst thou didst lay thy hand on me, and bring The gleaming Cross more near; And my whole being quailed with agony, And writhed with burning smart, When thou didst lift its bright, sharp edge on high, And plant it in my heart. Friend! I am conquered now, and all my powers With holier impulse burn, And yet I dare not trust myself when hours Of languid ease return. Then do I envy wild sea-birds that float, And wish that we could be Rocking for ever in a little boat On some blue sunny sea: And I would fain be dreaming, while the tide Of active change doth roll, That we at anchor and at ease might ride Safe in each other's soul. It may not be: I and my dreams must part,— Part in the blood that flowed, Where the stern Cross ran deepest in my heart, Tearing its cruel road. That pool of blood shall stand for ever there Where the dread Sign took root, So shall the Cross have plants and blossoms rare Grow up around its foot. The watch-tower steps are fallen to decay, Broken in every stone, And it is perilous to wind one's way To that high place alone. But, wert thou with me there, the wildest night Would not seem dark or long; And we would sing old Psalms till morning light Broke in upon our song. And should these rebel dreams of earth arise Against my hardy vow, Then shall I dread a friend that can chastise As faithfully as thou! XLVIII.TO A LITTLE BOY. Dear Little One, and can thy mother find In those soft lineaments, that move so free To smiles or tears, as holiest infancy About thy heart its glorious web doth wind, A faithful likeness of my sterner mind? Ah! then there must be times unknown to me When my lost boyhood, like a wandering air, Comes for a while to pass upon my face, Giving me back the dear familiar grace O'er which my mother poured her last fond prayer. But sin and age will rob me of this power, Though now my heart, like an uneasy lake, Some broken images at times may take From forms which fade more sadly every hour! XLIX. VERSES SENT TO A FRIEND, WITH A BOOK. I The languid heart, that hath been ever nurst By strains of drowsy sweetness, ill can brook The rude rough music that at times doth burst From him whose thoughts are treasured in this book. It was his lot to live in days uncouth That shrink from aught so hard and stern as truth. II I know my generous friend too well to fear This holy gift will be unsafe with thee; Thou never yet hast had the heart to sneer At the eccentric feats of chivalry, And well I know there are cold men who deem This saintly cause a weak knight-errant's dream. III When thou hast marked him well, thine eye will trace Lines deep and steadfast, features grave and bold, Beauty austere and masculine, a face And stalwart form wrought in an antique mould; And if some shades too broad and coarse be thrown, 'Tis where the age hath marred the block of stone! L. WRITTEN IN A LITTLE LADY'S LITTLE ALBUM. I Hearts good and true Have wishes few In narrow circles bounded, And hope that lives On what God gives Is Christian hope well founded. II Small things are best: Grief and unrest To rank and wealth are given; But little things On little wings Bear little souls to Heaven. LI. THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA. Oh, thou old heartless Sea, without a tide To bless thee with its changing! Ah, poor Sea! How idly beat thy waves, how languidly On Baiæ's piers, or Adria's level side! Eternal sunset round old Greece doth play: All faint and wan Rome's last imperial smile Yet lingers in each Hellespontine bay. Still at his mouths the melancholy Nile Talks to himself of Egypt's kingly day. A belt of goodly towns have ruins hoar, Silent as tombs, on Libya's blighted shore; And Venice woos her blue canals no more: Yet for all this no heart is in thy waves, Thou heavy Sea of shadows and of graves! LII. HEAVEN AND EARTH. There are no shadows where there is no sun; There is no beauty where there is no shade; And all things in two lines of glory run, Darkness and light, ebon and gold inlaid. God comes among us through the shroud of air; And His dim track is like the silvery wake Left by yon pinnace on the mountain lake, Fading and re-appearing here and there. The lamps and veils through Heaven and Earth that move Go in and out, as jealous of their light, Like sailing stars upon a misty night. Death is the shade of coming life; and Love Yearns for her dear ones in the holy tomb, Because bright things are better seen in gloom. LIII. A FAREWELL. Sept. 8, 1838. I My heart was like a wooded vale, Bright with a summer afternoon, With shades so thick the sun was pale And thin as an autumnal moon; And winds made stirs in every tree, Most like a far-off, quiet sea. II There came a cloud o'er this bright home, Sudden and strange; and no one knew From whence the omen dark had come When all the sky around was blue. The wind dropped down; and sounds came near, Like thunder when the air is clear. III Still hangs that gloomy cloud above, Hiding the glorious sun, whose power Once shed romantic lights of love On moorland stream and forest bower, When all things wore a charm to me, Of sweetest unreality. IV In pale and tarnished green, the trees Stand by yon brook in silent row; Rills that made songs to every breeze Have lost the music of their flow: And wildflowers mourn the summer air That comes not now to wanton there. V Ah, brother!—wouldst thou know how much My aching heart in thee doth live? One look of thy quick eye—one touch Of thy dear hand last night could give Fresh hopes to shine amid my fears, And thoughts that shed themselves in tears. LIV. A CONVERSATION NEAR RYDAL. Sept. 8, 1838. I could have wished the few last precious hours I had with thee, dear friend, should have been given To dreams of love, and thoughts and hopes of Heaven. Autumn is out among these woodland bowers: Still am I lingering here, as loth to part From my soul's glorious king. Yet ah! my heart Hath been at wayward angry war with thine. I spoke rude words of those who are at rest, Profaning him whose memory thou dost shrine In some choice niche within thy secret breast. 'Twas a rude act: but friendships newly sprung Are flowers of timid growth and little faith.— The softest footfall and the lightest breath Will jar a chord that hath been overstrung. LV. GREEN BANK. Sept. 12, 1838. I Brother, brother! thou art gone, and I will not mourn thy going, Though thou hast been unto me like a river in its flowing; For many a fresh and manly thought, and many a glorious dream, Like fruits and flowers of foreign lands, have flourished by the stream. Yet, brother, it is well to part: a sunset in the sky Sinks deepest in the heart when it is fading from the eye! II The heart is never safe unless it trembles while it woos; Man cannot love a treasure that he does not fear to lose. In touch and look and earnest tone, and many a little way Thy spirit will be more with me when thou art far away: For men may dwell by mountain streams, and all the summer round Have music lingering in their ears till they forget the sound. III Though it be bitterness and pain to bid a friend good-bye, Yet love will catch the tear-drops as they hurry from the eye: And friendship's rarest, holiest flowers spring up from loyal fears, Frail blooms that give no scent unless we water them with tears: And rich and happy is the heart wherein there always dwell, Like household gods, the memories of many a kind farewell! LVI. ADMIRATION OF NATURE. When men talk much to me of woods and hills, How evening lights and star-embroidered skies Go through them with mysterious sympathies, How gushing cataracts and diving rills Find way into their hearts, and Autumn pale, And Spring ere sunny June hath raised her veil, And Summer's breadth of shade, are full of thought— Then I believe them not: they have but caught A trick of words from some dear minstrel's verse. The awful spirit of reserve, that dwells In nature's forms and shadows, hides in cells, The jealous hearts of bards, her treasures rare. Men that have been with God learn silence there, Nor at all times their secret joys rehearse. LVII. TO A BOOKISH FRIEND. Talk not of books; thou hast not been with me, Free and bareheaded where the wind is wildest, Lifting its loud voice on the tumbling sea, Or riding fast o'er Loughrigg's many knolls: No, nor where ebon night's dread power is mildest, In Kirkstone, when the wandering nightwind tolls Hoarse minute-bells among the rocky towers: Nor lurked at noon in Brathay's hazel bowers. Thou hast not seen the dawn's first blushing beams Gild the grey battlements of Ravenscar, The hills, the pines, the hundred foamy streams; Nor talked all night to some most heavenly star, Where solitude hath got her holiest dwelling, By the black tarn where Fairfield meets Helvellyn! LVIII. KING'S BRIDGE. I The dew falls fast, and the night is dark, And the trees stand silent in the park; And winter passeth from bough to bough With stealthy foot that none may know, But little the old man thinks he weaves His frosty kiss on the ivy leaves. From bridge to bridge with tremulous fall The river droppeth down, And it washeth the base of a pleasant hall On the skirts of Cambridge town. Old trees by night are like men in thought, By poetry to silence wrought; They stand so still and they look so wise, With folded arms and halfshut eyes, More shadowy than the shade they cast When the wan moonlight on the river passed. The river is green, and runneth slow— We cannot tell what it saith; It keepeth its secrets down below, And so doth Death! II Oh! the night is dark; but not so dark As my poor soul in this lonely park: There are festal lights by the stream, that fall, Like stars, from the casements of yonder hall; But harshly the sounds of gladness grate On one that is crushed and desolate. From bridge to bridge with tremulous fall The river droppeth down, As it washeth the base of a pleasant hall On the skirts of Cambridge town. Oh, Sister! Sister! could I but hear What this river saith in night's still ear, And catch the faint whispering voice it brings From its lowlands green and its reedy springs; It might tell of the spot where the greybeard's spade Turned the cold wet earth in the lime-tree shade. The river is green, and runneth slow— We cannot tell what it saith: It keepeth its secrets down below, And so doth Death! III For death was born in thy blood with life— Too holy a fount for such sad strife: Like a secret curse from hour to hour The canker grew with the growing flower, And little we deemed that rosy streak Was the tyrant's seal on thy virgin cheek. From bridge to bridge with tremulous fall The river droppeth down, As it washeth the base of a pleasant hall On the skirts of Cambridge town. But fainter and fainter thy bright eyes grew, And ruder and redder that rosy hue; And the half-shed tears that never fell, And the pain within thou wouldst not tell, And the wild, wan smile,—all spoke of death, That had withered my sister with his breath. The river is green, and runneth slow— We cannot tell what it saith: It keepeth its secrets down below, And so doth Death! IV 'Twas o'er thy harp one day in June, I marvelled the strings were out of tune; But lighter and quicker the music grew, And deadly white was thy rosy hue; One moment—and back the colour came, Thou calledst me by my Christian name. From bridge to bridge with tremulous fall The river droppeth down, As it washeth the base of a pleasant hall On the skirts of Cambridge town. Thou badest me be silent and bold, But my brain was hot, and my heart was cold. I never wept, and I never spake, But stood like a rock where the salt seas break; And to this day I have shed no tear, O'er my blighted rose and my sister's bier. The river is green, and runneth slow— We cannot tell what it saith: It keepeth its secrets down below, And so doth Death! V I stood in the church with burning brow, The lips of the priest moved solemn and slow. I noted each pause, and counted each swell, As a sentry numbers a minute-bell; For unto the mourner's heart they call From the deeps of that wondrous ritual. From bridge to bridge with tremulous fall The river droppeth down, As it washeth the base of a pleasant hall On the skirts of Cambridge town. But little to me were the psalm and prayer, As they rose and fell on the cold church air, Nor felt I a holier presence near Than the withered flower on her darksome bier; But I stood and prayed, as mourners may, True prayer, though the thoughts be far away. The river is green, and runneth slow— We cannot tell what it saith: It keepeth its secrets down below, And so doth Death! VI The dew falls fast, and the night is dark; The trees stand silent in the park. The festal lights have all died out, And nought is heard but a lone owl's shout. The mists keep gathering more and more; But the stream is silent as before. From bridge to bridge with tremulous fall The river droppeth down, As it washeth the base of a pleasant hall On the skirts of Cambridge town. Why should I think of my boyhood's pride As I walk by this low-voiced river's side? And why should its heartless waters seem Like a horrid thought in a feverish dream? But it will not speak; and it keeps in its bed The words that are sent us from the dead, The river is green, and runneth slow— We cannot tell what it saith: It keepeth its secrets down below, And so doth Death! LIX. TO A FRIEND. Thou walkest with a glory round thy brow, Like Saints in pictures,—radiant in the blaze And splendour of thy boyhood, mingling now With the bold bearing of a man, that plays In eyes which do with such sweet skill express Thy soul's hereditary gentleness. Thou art my friend's best friend; and higher praise My heart hath none to give, nor thine to take; So I have loved thee for my brother's sake. But when thou talk'st of England's better days, And from its secret place thy soul comes forth, And sits upon thy lips as on a throne, Then would I fain do homage to thy worth, Not for his sake so much as for thine own. LX. TO A FRIEND. “Pignus accepimus, ut incipiamus in Domino et in Deo nostro tranquilli esse.”—St. Augustin. We have two things to do, to live and die: To win another and a longer life Out of this earthly change and weary strife; To catch the hours that one by one go by, And write the Cross upon them as they fly. So shall they lay their burden gently down, Sinking, perchance hard-by, beneath the Throne, Withdrawn anew into eternity. 'Tis hard to live by youth's fast bubbling springs, And treat our loves, joys, hopes, as flowery things That for awhile may climb the boughs, and twine Among the prickly leaves of discipline. Yet, wouldst thou rise in Christ's self-mastering school, Thy very heart itself must beat by rule. LXI. FAVOURITE BOOKS. Here, in thy choice old city, do I dwell At thy dread feet, most honoured Clarendon! Catching the precious words, that one by one Fall from thy lips; because I love full well Thy good and stately sadness: and I prize, As warnings for this land, the auguries Wherewith, like fatal seeds, thy pages swell. From these hot thoughts and tears full oft I fly To the gay Froissart, and those wondrous men Who dreamed of honour, and had heart to die For their own brave and glorious dream; and then, Albeit with childish lingerings, again I turn to graver books, where by my side Lies Ori en, my dear and perilous guide. LXII. TO A SANGUINE FRIEND. I cannot live on dreams my whole life long, I cannot gaze on ruined arch, and aisle, And altar desolate,—and then beguile My weary soul with some old loyal song, Or tale of English honour. 'Tis not years Have chilled my blood or made my spirit cold, But ancient books, kindling new hopes and fears, The awful features of the Church unfold. Yet, when in this dear land sad hearts behold That Church alone at her deserted prayers Amid her empty niches, unawares Old truths revive and coward men grow bold; And shall my heart give way, while thou art by, Thine own meek self our surest prophecy? LXIII. APRIL MORNINGS. I A thousand are the minstrel tongues In this unequal clime, Whose sweetest notes have been of spring And of her primrose time. II More songs hath April of her gifts,— Bright sun and rainy breeze, Than May with her pale flower-beds, And June with her broad trees. III I dare not join the mighty souls Upon the poet's hill, Though, looking long on those green heights, My dream may come true still. IV Yet will I hymn this season good Which doth such joy impart, And wakes new fervour in the blood, Old lightness in the heart. V It takes the fetters from the lyre On April's first white dawn, When the sun is on the evergreens Upon the college lawn. VI It doth unlock young fancy's wells To run all summer long, Till the whole heart is overflowed With unimprisoned song. VII Those wells are chartered for the year To wind o'er field and hill, Early and late, in sun and shower, Speaking in songs at will. VIII All things are metrical and free, That taste of spring's wild treasure; Our very thoughts, in their first joy, Come out in lyric measure. IX Yet, Brother, most I love this time,— For Spring, as she goes by, Will trim the fires of the old year In thy dark speaking eye. X Last summer's harp from yon oak-tree, Young Poet! thou shalt bring, And we will play a measure here In honour of the Spring! LXIV.TO A FRIEND. Oh by the love which unto thee I bear, By the tall trees and streams, and everything In the white-clouded sky or woodland air, Whether of sight or sound, that here may bring The joyous freshness of the grassy spring— Fain would I warn thee; for too well I know, Be what thou wilt, thou must be dear to me. And lo! thou art in utter bondage now, Whence I would have thy manly spirit free. Among the hills we two did never mar The moss about the springs, but learnt to spare Pale flowers which rude hands would not leave to grow; And if thou wert so wisely gentle there— Thy soul hath better flowers—oh! be as guiltless now. LXV. LLYNSYVADDON. By summer lakes and copsewoods green We two in happy times have been; And blyther pilgrims never rode, Since Leven down her valley flowed, Or mass was sung and prayer was said In Furness o'er the Christian dead. That was a day of love and mirth Which may not dawn again on earth. Each plant that in the hedges grew, Fox-glove, and fern, and bell of blue, And bending rose-branch—all were bright With more than summer's common light. We thought that day by Leven's brink Sad thoughts, which youth delights to think, That in its musings it may feel How well and gently love can steal On drooping hearts and troubled eyes, And take our sadness by surprise. Another year is well-nigh told: My heart and spirits have waxed old, From growing thought, fresh gifts and fears, More than in all my other years! Sweet are the oaks in summer-tide By Llynsyvaddon's reedy side, Or the cool alders arching o'er Where Usk indents his earthy shore. There hath not been a brighter dawn On old Llanthony's mountain lawn, Or Honddy's wave—not since the hour When Mynarch feasted in Tretower. By rock and tree the tyrant sun Reigned fiercely o'er the cloudless noon; And I had dreamed yon mistwreath still Was resting on some Cumbrian hill, And fancy for awhile had given To Usk the sweeter song of Leven. Alas! how changed is all the scene, Mountains and streams and dingles green! The ivied tower in every vale, Some haunt of legendary tale, The flowery slope, the mossy spring, No tuneful words or thoughts can bring. They pass through spirits ill at ease, Like summer winds through leafless trees. For then it was thy heart and eye That touched and stirred the poetry. But now, among the hills alone, The color from my dream is gone; And lonely hearts will often move Harsh doubts of those they fondest love. Sadness is selfish; and the throng Of thoughts in loneliness too strong To make or leave a home for song! Llanthony lurks in Ewia's vale, And Wye half-clasps her Tintern pale, And Usk is flowing every hour By Ragland, Brecon, and Tretower. Yet could I see the summer smile Just now in Furness' haunted pile, The broken choir, the hollow grove, Which we did people with our love,— Wye with her woodland tides might be A place, a name, forgot by me, And Usk rave downward to the sea. Yes—by my love for thee I swear Those mountains green and valleys fair, With all their castles, are not worth One ruined abbey in the North. LXVI. CHILDHOOD. I Dost thou remember how we lived at home— That it was like an oriental place, Where right and wrong, and praise and blame did come By ways we wondered at and durst not trace, And gloom and sadness were but shadows thrown From griefs that were our sire's, and not our own? II It was a moat about our souls, an arm Of sea, that made the world a foreign shore, And we were too enamoured of the charm To dream that barks might come and waft us o'er. Cold snow was on the hills; and they did wear Too wild and wan a look to tempt us there. III We had traditions of our own, to weave A web of creed and rite and sacred thought; And when a stranger, who did not believe As they who were our types of God had taught, Came to our home, how harsh his words did seem, Like sounds that mar but cannot break a dream. IV And then in Scripture some high things there were, Of which, they said, we must not read or talk; And we through fear did never trespass there, But made our Bibles like our twilight walk In the deep woodlands, where we durst not roam To spots from whence we could not see our home. V Albeit we fondly hoped, when we were men, To learn the lore our parents loved so well, And read the rites and symbols which were then But letters of a word we could not spell— Church-bells, and Sundays, and the Altar-stair In whose dread Gift we were too young to share. VI But we too soon from our safe place were driven; The world broke in upon our orphaned life. Dawnings of good, young flowers that looked to Heaven, It left untilled for what seemed manlier strife; Like a too-early summer, bringing fruit Where spring perchance had meant another shoot! VII Some begin life too soon,—like sailors thrown Upon a shore where common things look strange; Like them they roam about a foreign town, And grief awhile may own the force of change. Yet, though one hour new dress and tongue may please, Our second thoughts look homeward, ill at ease. VIII Come then unto our childhood's wreck again— The rocks hard-by our father's early grave; And take the few chance treasures that remain, And live through manhood upon what we save. So shall we roam the same old shore at will, In the fond faith that we are children still! IX Christian! thy dream is now—it was not then: Oh! it were strange if childhood were a dream. Strife and the world are dreams: to wakeful men Childhood and home as jealous Angels seem: Like shapes and hues that play in clouds at even, They have but shifted from thee into Heaven! LXVII. ROSS CHURCHYARD. It is an evening of profound repose: The sun's last light is passing up the Wye; The hills and woods, the quiet earth and sky, More than is wont that inner world disclose, Which they so barely cover. All is still— So still, so little likely to surprise The world's wayfaring sons, that it might fill A Christian heart with strange and dim surmise. The end perchance may come with like still power, The world's last evening, man's last trial-hour, When the glad Church, to whom alone is given To read earth's types and rites with faultless art, May see the shadows from the inner heaven Stirring on its pale earthly counterpart. LXVIII. THE FEAST OF THE INVENTION OF THE HOLY CROSS. [May 3.] “We heard of it in Ephrata; we have found it in the fields of the wood.”—Ps. cxxxi. 6. I We came to bid farewell: it was the day Whereon the white earth-fretted Cross was found; And we, strange chance! did meet it on our way, As we were in an ancient pleasure-ground, Close by a languid river, where the spring 'Mid bursting buds and flowers was rioting. II It was a garden wild, a mystic scene, Which an old poet in times past had planned, And May was colouring with lines of green The goodly work of his religious hand. For he had thought a broad Church-cross to make, And bade the elms the hallowed form to take. The gardens of St. John's, Cambridge, laid out by Prior. III Transept and nave each summer roofs with care; And here perchance in life's less happy hours The dwellers in that studious House repair To learn deep Christian things from homely flowers, When evening comes with many winds to chime Up in the trees her own cathedral time. IV Outside the Cross a wilderness was laid, Apt likeness of the world—had it not been That moss and colonies of primrose made Too sweet a desert, far too fair a scene! There many a proud young fritillary weaves With hyacinths his panther-spotted leaves: V And lily-plants in scattered pairs, like gems, Shine in the tall dark grass between the trees, Stooping to empty on their own green stems The morning dew from their red chalices; For at high noon the drops lay sparkling still On king-cup pale and jealous daffodil. VI We came to bid farewell: beneath the shade Old times, old dreams were sweetly pondered o'er, And sweeter was the welcome that we made To wiser hopes,—and I did love thee more For all the signs thou wert so meekly giving Of the grave inward life which thou art living! VII We came and bade farewell; and thou didst go To lands where trees have larger leaves than ours; But the fair fields where foreign rivers flow, Their piny hills, will give thee no such powers, As the low hazel-woods and forest brakes That open to our own unworldly lakes. VIII Unworldly lakes!—Did we not dream away Part of our manhood by their inland coves, Living, like summer insects, all the day In summer winds or shade of drowsy groves? And with our endless songs and joyous airs Made wings unto ourselves as bright as theirs? IX Farewell!—These lines may go where thou hast gone, Home's echo to thee in transalpine bowers; Our past leave-takings are the food, whereon All friendship lives; and in her barren hours Shall memory poetic impulse borrow From the green place and hour of that sweet sorrow. LXIX. AMBITIOUS REPENTANCE. I Peace! Peace! What aileth thee, poor sinful heart? Rest in thy lonely room— Scant happiness and sinner's penance-gloom Henceforth must be thy part. II Why cravest thou, poor soul! fresh want or pain, Mishap or sickness strong? He must be old in faith, who dares to long For punishment again. III The Cross, the Thorns, the Woes, that press thee now, Have yet got fruit to bear; And there is virtue still in each keen care To scathe thy lofty brow. IV Absence of earthly hopes, no prospects brave By some chance joy exposed, And vents of sweetest mortal feeling closed With cold earth from the grave:— V These are thy riches, where thy lone abode Mid withered loves is cast, And ghosts of broken day-dreams, and the past Accusing thee to God. VI All things that touch thee wither—let them be! For thou dost wither all. Stern cheer! mid blight and barrenness they call, The Dead call out to thee. VII The early faults which compass thee about, To aid thy frailty come, And clear for penitence a hidden home, And keep the world's praise out. VIII All round thee, like kind wreaths of cloud, they rise, To hide the heart's fresh bloom, That thou may'st still be troubled in thy gloom By men's hard tongues and eyes. IX Covet no more; nor in ambitious hours Thy little strength forget: Ah! there is store of bitter honey yet Deep in these scentless flowers. X One joy is undenied: one earthly dream Kept from the barren past: One golden sunburst that o'er feast and fast Shines with an equal gleam. XI Thou canst not bear to lose it, ever twining Bright thoughts among the dark; 'Twould be thy death, poor soul! no more to mark Its solitary shining. XII Covet no more: from these few pangs thou must Enough for penance earn; And wait and work: faith's last hard lesson learn, Calmness in self-distrust. XIII Autumnal thoughts, the greenest honours shed, With dreams and loves decayed, At every wind's first bidding, straight obeyed,— These strew thy hermit bed. XIV Wan as an autumn sun thy whole youth through On feeblest shinings live; And later on new frosts perchance may give Autumnal beauty too. LXX. TO A LAKE PARTY. I We shall all meet again, Not in the wood or plain, Nor by the lake's green marge; But we shall meet once more By a far greener shore, With our souls set at large. II We all shall never stand On Rothay's white-lipped strand, And hear the far sheep-cries: The Wansfell wind may blow, But not to kindle now The bright fire in our eyes. III The three cleft mountains stand In their own treeless land, Where we all stood and wondered. The black cliffs are the same Where the hundred echoes came That dark day when it thundered. IV The summer sun sinks nightly Into the Solway brightly— We are not there to see. The mountain loophole seems Full of the golden beams, Full as it used to be. V Athwart the sunlit vale The heavy ravens sail, Each to his craggy dwelling; While evening gathers brown On thy stone-sprinkled down, Thou desolate Helvellyn! VI Still, still, in twilight shade Mountains make me afraid, And the wood-sounds at night; The red moon in the pine, And lustrous tarns that shine, With grey and ghostly light. VII But vain to me the show; My heart is weary now Of all its holy places. Oh! what are sun and shower, Hill-path and forest-bower. Where there are no friend's faces? VIII My youth is left behind For some one else to find, Upon a bare green mountain: My self-tuned harp is thrown, Where a juniper clasps a stone, Near a moss-belted fountain. IX We shall all meet again, Not in the wood or plain, Nor by the lake's green marge. The past shall be lived o'er By a far greener shore, With our souls set at large. LXXI. CAMBRIDGE. Ah me! were ever river-banks so fair, Gardens so fit for nightingales as these? Were ever haunts so meet for summer breeze, Or pensive walk in evening's golden air? Was ever town so rich in court and tower To woo and win stray moonlight every hour? One thing thou lackest much; the wild wind swells, The feast-days come, and yet night silent falls On the poor listening stream and patient halls; Thou art a voiceless place,—thou hast no bells. Yea, but for thy mute shrines, thou wert a town That might grey Oxford's vocal towers disdain, Where Isis flows and Cherwell ripples down, Timing their several voices to the strain! LXXII. PAST FRIENDS. Are there such things as friends that pass away? When each fresh opening season of our life, Through the dim-struggling crowd and weary strife, Brings kindred spirits nigh, whom we would pray Might live with us, and by our death-bed stay, Do these, our chosen ones, sink down at last Into the common grave of visions past? Ah! there are few men in the world can say They had a dream which they do not dream still; Few fountains in the heart which cease to play, When those, whose touch evoked them at their will, Sit there no more: and I my dreams fulfil, When to high heaven my tongue still nightly bears Old names, like broken music, in my prayers. LXXIII.SONNET-WRITING. TO F. W. F. Young men should not write sonnets, if they dream Some day to reach the bright bare seats of fame: To such, sweet thoughts and mighty feelings seem As though, like foreign things, they rarely came. Eager as men, when haply they have heard Of some new songster, some gay-feathered bird, That hath o'er blue seas strayed in hope to find In our thin foliage here a summer home, Fain would they catch the bright things in their mind, And cage them into sonnets as they come. No; they should serve their wants most sparingly, Till the ripe time of song, when young thoughts fail, Then their sad sonnets, like old bards, might be Merry as youth, and yet grey-haired and hale. LXXIV.THE SAYING OF ST. HERMAS. “Concupisce opus tuum, et salvus eris.” I The whole world hath gone out to buy, Estates and goods to multiply: The sunny field, the garden ground, The woods that gird the city round, The cedar hall, the ample street, The quay where busy merchants meet,— All places and all spirits burn, And for the world's weak treasure yearn. II Servant of Christ! be thou like these, All day and night forego thine ease; Crave, covet, lust, and labour still, Till thou the Master's storehouse fill. Be crafty at thy toil, and ply All seasons round thy usury. Deny thyself, and hoard thy gold For Him who died for thee of old. III Let not thy life be soft and free, Cushion and couch are not for thee. Brave shining stone and raiment fair Leave thou for kings and priests to wear. For them let rich robes be unfurled Who bear God's Name within the world. Thy throne, O man of God, is yet Behind thick clouds and trials set. IV Let go all mortal grief and mirth; And, as the world is wise for earth, To thee like wisdom shall be given To covet still and hoard for heaven. Empty on priests, and heathen lands, And widows pale, thy willing hands: While prince and peer of old names dream, Let alms thy sin-pledged soul reedeem. V Wide, Christian! is thy mother's field, A hundredfold her valleys yield. Hoard, and then waste: oh! scatter round Thy seed in faith upon the ground. When men are deep in feast and mirth, Steal out and bury gold in earth, Then back into the world and ply Once more thy hard trade cheerily. LXXV. COLLEGE LIFE. There is fair beauty here, and Christian homes, And a high call to every steadfast heart To keep chaste watch, and fill a solemn part Whereto weak self-disturbance rarely comes; And had I power to knock away below The frail, false props that long have borne me up, I might have nerve to drain the royal cup, Nor keep it at my lips, as I do now. Yet amid Shrines, and Rites, and Forms of fear, And meek men growing good and great around, As though their roots had struck in holy ground, My poor base soul is starving feebly here, A young, unshapely tree, for ever giving The fruits of loveless days and lonely living. LXXVI. ON A PUPIL'S PORTRAIT. Dear Boy! when I do look into thy face Glittering with sunny thoughts, I fain would bless Thee for thy beauty and thy boyishness, For the fair brow youth crowns with freshest grace, For the light spirits and the humours wild, Wherewith my sadness is infected so That years drop off me, and dull thoughts forego A reign which o'er my heart hath not been mild. Yea, for all this I bless thee; but a part More grave and stern is mine, for they commit To my safe charge, young boy! thy merry heart, So gentle one hard word hath wounded it. Oh thou shalt hear no more hard words from me, But, when thou sinn'st, my prayers shall set thee free. LXXVII.ENGLAND'S TRUST. I joy that the times are dark and dreary, I joy that the earth is old, That the hands of our kings are weak and weary, And the hearts of our nobles cold. I joy that the good and few are fearing, And the camp and court at play, That the swift-riding world is out of hearing, When the watchword comes this way. I joy for the signs of strife and trouble, And for England's awakening might, For the voices deep that are sounding double, Like the striking of clocks at night. I joy for the words that all are speaking, A language the earth had lost, For the hardy thoughts and steady seeking Whose path may not be crossed. The nation too long hath weakly striven In the craft of her own wise hand, For it is not through laws or wisdoms that Heaven Deals health to a gold-stricken land. I joy for this day that the calm and agèd Cease vaunting of England through fear, It tells that the thirst for self-praise is assuagèd, And the shock to rouse life in her near. I joy for the young that they lay not her honour In the stir of song and story, Nor in that which mere blood of her sons hath won her, Her world-wide name of glory. I joy for the loss of the noisy gladness That hath made late years so dull; But more I joy for the humbling sadness Whereof true hearts are full. Trust may not be in wisdoms hoary, Nor in wealth and greatness blent, But in the faith that this dream of glory Came to us for punishment. LXXVIII.THIRLMERE. I There are two times in life, to love and fear,— Two times like birth and death; They are two different echoes that we hear, Which Heaven uttereth. II Those are not real—the strong-vaulted sky, The heavy-flowing seas, The rocky roots of hills, and lakes that lie In hollows deep like these. III Heaven comes with her two voices, old and young, Creating these for us; They are but mystic shadows dimly flung From off our spirits thus. IV All hope, all joy, all mortal life with such Sweet sadness is inlaid: And all things have on them from Heaven a touch Of sunshine or of shade. V I have been here before, yet scarce can tell The outline of the hills; The light is changed,—another voice doth swell In those wild-sounding rills. VI I have been here before: in sun and shade A blythe green place it seemed: Here have I talked with friends, sweet songs have made, And lovely things have dreamed. VII And I have ridden to the lake this day With more than common gladness; But hill and flood upon me strangely weigh With new and fearful sadness. VIII And all bright forms without me I would take— A redbreast on the wall, A buzzard flapping o'er the cold blue lake, A hundred streams that call IX One to another all Helvellyn over, The light upon the pine, Yon single pine on high, that can discover There is a sun to shine: X But, above all, the boy who at my side, For boyhood hath no morrow, Bound up in his own merry thoughts, doth chide His dull friend for his sorrow; XI Yea—above all, that boy to whom is given Better than miser's pelf, To love, and such love ever is of Heaven, One older than himself:— XII All these bright things into my soul I take, That they may shed light there, And they but give cold blueness to the lake, Cold brightness to the air. XIII Oh! speak to me, thou lake! thou mountain brow! In that old voice of joy— Oh! speak to me, as ye are speaking now To that pure-hearted boy. XIV “Nay, bid us not, we are but voiceless things, Shadows and pomps for thee; We can but echo the dread voice that rings From Heaven's blue canopy; XV “And thou hast deadened it; we cannot hear Through that thick soul of thine; We are mute slaves, and waiting mutely here For thee to give the sign. XVI “Sunshine and shade, sweet wind and pearly shower— All these we have of thee; Our light and gloom we borrow every hour From thine infinity. XVII “We have no depth, no substance of our own, No life which we inherit,— Oh! blame not us; we are pale outlines thrown From thine undying spirit.” LXXIX. LENT. I Yes! I have walked the world these two months past With quick free step, loud voice, and youth's light cheer; And dull and weary were the shadows cast From the dark Cross and Lent's dim portals near. II Yes! I rode up with such a noisy state And retinue of all things bright and fair, And reached in this new pilgrim guise the gate, As though my dreams might have free passage there. III Dreams of far travel, visionary love, Hopes, memories, sweet songs, and sunny faces, Cheering each other on, with me did move Some way on Lent's keen roads and desert places. IV And many a pilgrim wending o'er the plain, With face half-veiled and tear-drops flowing fast, Marvelled perchance at that unsightly train, When I and my strange servitors rode past. V But every stone that lay along the way, Wounding the feet of those who travelled by, Each sleety shower, chill blast, and cloudy day, Scattered my poor soft-living company. VI Thus as my spirit more and more drank in The deep mysterious dimness of the time, Old forms waxed pale, and lines and shapes of sin Wore hardly off, and my baptismal prime VII Grew into colour and distinctness there;— But my blythe train and equipage were gone, The songs and sunny smiles; my heart was bare, With Lent all darkening round me, and alone. VIII O joy of all our joys! to be bereft Of our false power to make the world so dear! O joy of all our joys! to be thus left In our wild years, with none but Jesus near! IX How sweetly then shall Lent's few Sundays shock The sadness which itself hath now grown sweet, Like the soft striking of an old church-clock, Making the heart of summer midnight beat. X How sweetly now shall this most holy gloom Gather and double on my chastened heart, Circling with dark bright folds the Garden-Tomb, Where Lent and I, like Christian friends, shall part. LXXX.HALF A HEART. I Come, I will give thee half a heart If that will do to love; And if I gave thee all, dear friend, It would but worthless prove. II Thou art too good to see or know The ills that in me dwell: It is most right to keep our faults From those we love so well. III So then I warn thee, do not think My fitful love untrue: I have another, darker self, Which thou must sometimes view. IV Men take me, change me if they may, And love me if they can; Few can do that; few choose, like thee, A double-hearted man. V My better self shall be thy friend, My worse self not thy foe, And to love light in time perchance, May make my darkness go. VI If I should seem to play thee false, Then pour thy love through prayer: It is the fit; my better heart Withdraws itself elsewhere. VII And weary not if I do still New light or gloom disclose: What else in sooth can poets be But men whom no one knows? LXXXI.THE LITANY. I O sweet, most sweet and penitential sound! In tides of chaste, austere old music setting O'er all those kneelers' hearts, at penance found, Weary with strife and unwise knowledge-getting. II O sweet, most sweet and penitential sound! Each low response, with organ notes attended, Loosens some link of sin which sadly bound Souls where the Church and world were too much blended. III O sweet, most sweet and penitential sound! Circling the Altar and the pillars grasping, Breathing a soul into the marble ground, Where knees are bending and mute hands are clasping! IV O sweet, most sweet and penitential sound! O prayer most dear, most dread, and full of Heaven! Pleading with saints to get our souls unbound, And have our sins and our soft lives forgiven. V O sweet, most sweet and penitential sound! Thy cadence thrills on me in times of sinning; Thy grieving fall hath oft my soul unbound, Its thoughts and dreams to calmer currents winning. VI O sweet, most sweet and penitential sound! O rite most dear! that in weak hours of vaunting, Languors of earthly love, or strivings crowned, Still keeps my heart a shrine with plaintive haunting. LXXXII.FRANCE. Put back the Fleur de Lys! Within the gates Of Rhodes the misbelieving Ishmaelite On hall and hostelry hath left unharmed The scutcheons of the military monks, Save where the Cross or Human Face appeared, Alike repugnant to his law. Yet now On all the ancient citadels of France, Sea-gates and palaces, the hand of wrath With foolish diligence hath knocked away The triple lilies from the fretted shield. And is it thus ye strive to quell the thought Of the crowned Capets? Is it thus, forsooth, Ye seek to stifle in your growing sons Those risings of the heart towards the past, Which kindle patriots' tears to fertilize The soil whence noblest aspirations spring, From out whose blossoms even now depends A holier future, their legitimate fruit? O wrath is blind; ye were in this your act Wisely unwise, and yet ye meant it not! Ye could not have devised a feast, or reared A pillar more memorial of the past, Or forced it on the fancy of your youth With more continuous admonition, rites More grave, than this dumb sacrifice of fear! Go to the Asian cemeteries, thread The cypress lanes of Smyrna or Stamboul; Spite of yourself one thought is uppermost, The slaughtered Janissaries! nay the cry Of the red Hippodrome seems ever blent With soft incessant cooing, for such spots Are populous with doves;—and whence is this But from the broken sepulchres which stand All turbanless amid their turbaned peers? And quickened by the infantine display Of the great despot's anger, memory dwells Upon the doom of those prætorians:—thus The very absence of the Fleur de Lys Writes it more deeply on the vacant shield Than the strong chisel; and within the mind, Nay oft with strange illusion to the eye, Obliterates, where such hath been engraved, The Jewish emblem. See, in this poor toil Of mischief, how the timorous insolence Of insecure success hath overreached Itself, and most reluctant homage paid Unto the very symbols of a past From which it deemed itself emancipate. O France! methinks it were a manlier game To make a plaything of old fetters, thus Attesting present freedom, and to keep In thoughtful ease the shackles in thy hands, Neither as things of shame nor spells of fear. Why tremble at thy lilies? If they be Less frail in stone than when the garden breeze Scatters the gold dust from their nodding bells, Yet freedom is itself a flower, which tops All growths except the weedy license bred Within its rich vicinity.—And yet Thou haply mightst reply that it was well To raze the wicked lily from thy walls, And by this outward action so to teach Thy children hatred of the bitter past, Which that pale flower doth symbolize. But hate Begets not wholesome fear, and bitterness Teaches no wisdom. They, whose savage tongues Hoot loudest round the scaffold, soonest come To a like end. Men profit not by wrong, Except they love the doers of the wrong, With such compassion as the fear of God Suggests, or sense of justice can admit. What though the later Bourbons, with their crew Of courtiers, and effeminate parasites, And smooth-tongued peers, O how unlike the peers Of the French court in good chivalric times!— Weighed heavily on the land, their abject yoke, Once shaken off, was barely worth a thought, A loathsome dream which one would studiously forbear To call to mind, a tyranny too vile To be thus honoured with enduring hate, Too impotent and stupid to become A national tradition in a land So rich in such remembrances. Ye priests And catholic scholars! by whose sacred toils That realm is waking to a better sense Of her grand functions, you would I beseech,— Alien in name yet wholly one in heart— To throw the Bourbon cause unto the winds, Or leave such loyal treason to the men Whose quest is in the world and worldly things. Ye have to build again the Church of Christ, Ye have Rome's lawful honour to retrieve, Ye have a pagan France within your France To be converted,—meddle not with plans Of mundane policy, but stand on high Above the interests of the passing hour, And all the pitiful politics of the day, And so shall revolutions' awful cloud Dash its forked lightnings far below your feet. Forewarned, forearmed! the cause of Holy Church Mates with no other; let the Bourbon name Pass from your watchwords as a doubtful thing Which may or may not prosper: stand alone, Aloof if need be; give unto the Church The lilies of the monarchy, and God Himself will give you kings. Those royal flowers Are virgin white: their spirit-stirring past They keep unsullied, and themselves have power To outgrow defilement, rooted in the tomb Of great St. Louis. O ye men of France! Your lilies will not fade alone; high thoughts And masculine purposes, the sense devout Of solemn destiny, and loyal zeal For the true faith of Christ, all, all will fade, And trampled lilies can exhale no scent. O then forget the heartless faults of kings: Freedom hath blood to be forgiven; 'twere well That had not stained the argent Fleur de Lys. See to it, Men of France! if with those flowers Ye have not even now unthroned yourselves. The kingly habit of obedience lost, What lingers that is worth a patriot's love? Goodness is greatness: and of Christian states None taught this lesson to the world so well As ancient France. O call to mind the days When good king Robert lived, or think of Blanche, Blanche and St. Louis, reigning first on earth, Thenceforth to reign in heaven; and not unsung, For I am English and have need to love Those royal names, be pious Erminilde, And Bertha, saintly queen of Ethelbert. Look o'er the width of this most various realm! Upon the heights above Grenoble stood The austere Bruno, planting there the Tree, Which mid the wild confusions of the world Blooms in tranquillity. See there the vales Of Burgundy, from whose chivalric youth Bernard began to build his living house Deep in the Vale of Absinth. Yonder lies Clermont, where once the enthusiast Peter preached, And suddenly upon ten thousand tongues The will of God alighted, and outspake As through a multitude of seers. And there, Alas how little prized! the holy cells Of Grandmont and Premontrè, and the site, Now desecrate, of Clugni's sumptuous pile. There like a jewel in the Midland Sea, Far off discerned, the isle of Lerins hangs Upon the coast of Provence, no fit haunt, As from its beauty might at first appear, For summer revel or a moonlit masque, But where in studious cloister Vincent lived And taught, and in the simple panoply Of catholic tradition armed, struck down The heretics. And in the west behold, (Looking towards England with instinctive wish, Daily developed through the Christian West, To appease the factions of that separate land,) The work of younger days, De Rancè's home, The stern La Trappe, with its three sullen lakes Hard by Mortagne. O France! are these to count As nothing in the presence of the change Which hath been wrought on thee, these ancient things And great historic sanctities, which grew Beneath the shadow of the Fleur de Lys? O write the past once more upon thy walls, And so shall it be written in thy soul. For thine is still the character that learns More by the outward eye than listening heart. It is not as a poet only, one Who dreams bright things and cares not if they come To pass, that I implore the sons of France To reinstate their Lily; as a man, A citizen, a priest, I plead the cause Of those religious times which are embalmed Within that flowery symbol. They who strive To dim the illumination of the past, And specially in such traditionary forms As have a hold upon the popular heart, Are like the devotees at whose dark rites The lamps were straightway quenched, that what was good Within them might not put to shame the bad, And meddle with the liberty of sin. O cast not off the famous France of yore! Cling to the very cyphers which attest Her old magnificence: and tear away From the wide surface of your provinces That cumbrous network of unsightly names, Which have no music to the generous ear. Enrich yon barren olive-spotted slopes With the sweet name of Provence; let the towers Of those fair minsters look around and see The woods of Normandy outspread; let eve Cast her rich gloom upon the Pyrenees To beautify the wolds of Aquitaine; Let Burgundy, Guienne, and green Poitou Call, through the potency of their brave names, Fresh knighthood from the earth for thy fresh needs: And let there be a king of France once more, A Dauphiny for appanage, and Rheims The keeper of the Chrism,—and at the helm Of thy new destinies let Europe see The spirit of St. Louis: then, O then, Shall it be well with thee, O France, and us, (For in how many things we hang on thee,) And all good things shall prosper in the West. Rise then, thou Christian Realm! and be thyself Once more, and this the sign that thou shalt give Of thy religious aims and brave intent:— Replace the Fleur de Lys upon its shield! Let thy sons' hearts be living shields, whereon To exalt again the authority of Rome. Think of St. Louis, let thy future be One long and steadfast vigil round his tomb; For so shalt thou be recognized once more, And by the emulous English most of all, The peerless nation of the Catholic West! LXXXIII. TWO FAITHS. Oh pray for me!—thou know'st what prayer I need! What is it to be one in whose weak heart Two faiths are lodged, while thought and feeling bleed In the wild war; yet neither will depart? What is it to be one, spell-drawn to stay For the completing of his nature, trembling Between two different characters each day, And seem to his harsh friends to be dissembling? Watch me, as thou hast watched Mosella's waves Bringing her clear, sweet waters down from Treves, To Neuendorf along yon southern shore Breasting with hope the turbulent green Rhine, Till the old flood claims both his banks once more: Pray on—pray on: like fate may yet be mine. LXXXIV.PROUD POETS. Nay, thou hast ceased to be a poet: pride Hath all displaced the heavenly gift within; Music of soul can live with many a sin, But will not with a haughty spirit bide. A bard is one on whom, as in a shower, Man's mighty deeds and lovely arts rain power; One whose quick soul hath fetched another sense, An inlet deep, where earth with her green things Mounts in a tide of vast intelligence, And mysteries that need interpretings. Can they be proud, who walk across the earth, Like fountains, shedding waters for the weary, Casting up truths and symbols to give mirth Unto the restless, light unto the dreary? LXXXV. AGED CITIES. I have known cities with the strong-armed Rhine Clasping their mouldered quays in lordly sweep; And lingered where the Maine's low waters shine Through Tyrian Frankfort; and been fain to weep 'Mid the green cliffs where pale Mosella laves That Roman sepulchre, imperial Treves. Ghent boasts her street, and Brùges her moonlight square; And holy Mechlin, Rome of Flanders, stands, Like a queen-mother, on her spacious lands; And Antwerp shoots her glowing spire in air. Yet have I seen no place, by inland brook, Hill-top, or plain, or trim arcaded bowers, That carries age so nobly in its look, As Oxford with the sun upon her towers. LXXXV.UNKIND JUDGING. To be thought ill of, worse than we deserve, To have hard speeches said, cold looks displayed, By those who should have cheered us when we swerve,— Is one of Heaven's best lots, and may be made A treasure ere we know it, a lone field Which to hot hearts may bitter blessings yield. Either we learn from our past faults to shrink, When their full guilt is kept before our eye, And, thinking of ourselves as others think, We so are gainers in humility: Or the harsh judgments are a gloomy screen, Fencing our altered lives from praise and glare; And plants that grow in shades retain their green, While unmeet sternness kindly chills the air. LXXXVII.ADMONITION. I know thee not, bright friend! but that thy looks Do draw me to thee, with thy boyhood rushing, As a sweet fever, through thy veins, and gushing From thy clear eyes in merry falls, like brooks Leaping, clear crystal things, from their stone fountains, And waking echoes in the noonday mountains. This is no place for thee; be warned in time. Thou must go haunt some free and breezy knoll, Ere this grey city come with spell sublime, Freezing her heartless state into thy soul. Thou hast been surely cradled out of doors, And the great forms that nursed thee are the truest; And, though these courts were Heaven's own azure floors, Yet days are coldest when the skies are bluest. LXXXVIII.GRISEDALE TARN. I Were I a man upon whose life An awful, untold sin did weigh, And Heaven vouchsafed not pain or strife Enough to do that guilt away, And it were well in mine old age To build myself an hermitage,— II I would not choose a savage place Where, all the heavenly seasons round, I should read anger in the face Of nature's bleak and joyless ground; And winds and streams have voices rude, Wherewith to mar the solitude. III No; for the many sins that stain me Barren and lonely should it be, High up where nature might unchain me With her strong mountain liberty, With charms that would, through sin-born fears, Keep fresh and free the source of tears. IV In yon pale hollow would I dwell, Where waveless Grisedale meekly lies, And the three clefts of grassy fell Let in the blueness of the skies; And lowland sounds come travelling up To echo in that mountain cup. V The morning light on mottled stones, The unfledged ravens' clamorous mirth, The broken gush and hollow moans Of waters struggling in the earth, And the white lines of bleating sheep Crossing, far up, the dewy steep; VI These, with the storms and calms, mayhap Enough of sight and sound would make For one in mountain nature's lap, A dweller by her loneliest lake; While banners bright of kindled mist Above his head might hang and twist. VII Where from the tarn the shallow brook By rough Helvellyn shapes its way, The window of my cell should look Eastward upon the birth of day; Nor should the place disfigured be By garden-plot or favorite tree. VIII One blame would I incur, nor fear To wound the stranger's curious eye; Some sceptral foxgloves I would rear Upon the yellow turf hard by: They might to an ascetic serve As types and teachers of reserve. IX From wanton summer's broadest sun Their perfect splendour they withhold; The regal blossoms, one by one, In single, separate pomp unfold, Shedding their frail red bells away In patient, gradual decay. X See with what pleasant slowness there, When hedge and wood are past their prime, Late summer with her fertile air Is forced that kingly stalk to climb; As though the world should read therein The Christian way deep truths to win. XI In every cleft a kneeling-place And cushion of dead fern should lie; From three such loop-holes I might trace Meanings and shapes in earth and sky; Huge emblems would they make for me Of the Most Holy Trinity! LXXXIX.LARCH TREES. All men speak ill of thee, unlucky Tree! Spoiling with graceless line the mountain edge, Clothing with awkward sameness rifted ledge, Or uplands swelling brokenly and free: Yet shalt thou win some few good words of me. Thy boughs it is that teach the wind to mourn, Haunting deep inland spots and groves forlorn With the true murmurs of the plaintive sea. When tuft and shoot on vernal woodlands shine, Who hath a green unwinterlike as thine? And when thou leanest o'er some beetling brow, With pale thin twigs the eye can wander through, There is no other tree on earth but thou Which brings the sky so near or makes it seem so blue. XC.WRITTEN IN A GREEN-HOUSE. Why are your scents so faint, your stems so slight? Why are your languid leaves outnumbered so By wealth of bell and blossom? Would ye go Back to Pacific lands or eastern light From whence ye came, bringing your juicy powers To heal and lull? But ailing man hath need In his sad lot of a botanic creed; So ye are summoned from your thousand bowers, Unwilling Congress from the world of flowers! And now the bard, wise idler, here may pore O'er the wild learning and the uncouth store Of studious boyhood's desultory hours, Rifling all books of travel, far and near, To shape a home for each exotic here. XCI.BRATHAY BRIDGE. Month after month more languid do I grow, Struggling and striving in life's sterile round, And in each strife and struggle losing ground, Letting the anchors of my spirit go. The morning long upon this sunny stone, Solaced and calmed by Brathay's flooded noise, For my late weakness I would fain atone, By putting from me life's unhopeful joys. But each wise vow and self-renouncing speech For their untruth the river, as it goes, Bears down; and, ever as the water flows, My better self flows past me out of reach; And the sweet sounds, in my soothed ears so long, Steal my soul's strength, debasing it to song. xcii.THE BRATHAY KINGFISHER. Thou hast a fair dominion here, Sir King! And yon tall stone beneath the alder stem Seems a meet throne for a gay crownéd thing, That wears so well its tawny diadem. Thou hast a fair dominion—pools and bays, With heath and copse and nooks of plumy fern; And tributes of sweet sound the river pays, Changing to blithe or sad at every turn. The gilded flies, when noon's faint zephyr stirs, Upon the sunny shallows walk or swim; And swallows too, those welcome foreigners, Under thy bridges, summer tourists, skim, Like the light crowd of English yearly thrown On river-banks less lovely than their own. XCIII.LOUGHRIGG. I Would they not judge untruly who should deem I had no friends but those I named in song? Would it not be ungentle thus to dream, And do poetic silence heartless wrong? II The meadow-brooks with their sweet clamor guide Their bending selves to a most wayward time, Will earth and sky less waywardly preside O'er the meek wills of poets in their prime? III So hath it been, dear Loughrigg! that till now My song hath touched less often than it might At thy fair mountain havens, which do glow With such a wealth of hues in this clear light. IV Oft as a poet, feeble at my craft, Did I seek shelter in Helvellyn's fame, And, with poor fraud, on my dull verses graft Fresh sound and fulness from his mighty name. V Yet it were hard if this most wondrous dawn, With its whole sheet of purest sunlight, thrown From the blue laughing skies o'er thy rough lawn, Cold bubbling brook, and lichen-written stone— VI Yes—it were hard, if such an hour at least Laid not on me some little tax of song, For thee, the table where, as at a feast, All the rich kinds of mountain beauty throng. VII Thou art a world in miniature, a land Wrought with such curious toil, as if in mirth Nature had thrown thee from her dexterous hand To be a sportive model of the earth. VIII All made by laws, green cleft and sinuous path Cross, like great mountain outlets, every way; And the long outline, which thy summit hath, Mimics rude Alp and splintered Himalay; IX Or like a Cross to Christians thou mayest seem, With thy four points to lake or river bent, Sunk in a font, and luring Heaven to gleam On thee through that redeeming element. X When first I saw thee, butterworts had set Their sickly stars about thy hundred springs, With one blue flower apiece, content to let The fresh fern fan them with its neighbouring wings. XI The fern was like green dust upon the hill, Which vernal winds might almost blow away; But it changed dresses with the months at will, And with the cold its fashions grew more gay. XII Ne'er have I felt the might of morning rest Its cold fresh welcome half so strong and free, As on thy heathy side and windy crest, Except in early daybreaks out at sea. XIII Oft, o'er the noonday woods, on thy west crown My rhyming fancy woodland visions weaves, Till, with old boyish impulse darting down, I plunge and lose myself among the leaves. XIV Thy southern scars, all masked with oak-wood bowers, Like feudal dwellings, mouldering whitely, shine Through the soft nights of summer, as the towers In the deep yellow moonlight on the Rhine. XV To winter's cold-eyed sun, o'er snowy drifts That scriptural tree, the juniper, doth lean, While many a patch of wannest silver shifts O'er the strange dazzling sheet of white and green. XVI One rainy summer, often as I stood Within yon churchyard, gazing on thy side, One brow of thine with an incessant flood Of fruitful sunlight rose in gleamy pride. XVII Let the wet skies be loaded e'er so much, That lighting up no dreary mist could swage: Care might as soon efface the angelic touch On the bright brow of sanctified old age. XVIII Many a calm fancy and sweet-sounding word To thee, dear Loughrigg! do of right belong; And, though thy name of softness be unheard, Thou of all mountains art mine undersong. XIX In tempted times, when my weak soul did need More than earth's props and stays, I fled to thee; And in thy sunken haunts I now may read The secrets of my own biography. XX O may no wind wake up for other ears The sad confessions trusted to thy keeping; But, for the Cross that pardons and the tears That win us grace, dear mountain, leave them sleeping! XCIV.THE WORLD'S WAKE. 'Twere a choice lot if my poor thoughts could make By meditative power a separate boat, Wherein their master and themselves might float, Some little way behind, in this world's wake. Now, as it swerves and rocks along its course Over smooth seas with new-discovered force, I in my boat would follow, uttering From out the bosom of a quiet time Words of most warning sweetness, shreds of rhyme Scarce to be heard for ocean's murmuring. And some few gentle ones upon the deck, Who heard my song and loved it, might make moan, When a rough wave, that made my bark a wreck, Left the gray sea and glistering wake alone. XCV.IN-DOORS AND OUT-OF-DOORS. There are three gifts apart, whereby good men Do good unto their fellows. Some can press Power out of heartless books with subtle pen, Through steadfast years of in-doors weariness. Others there are, who in the outward fret Of states and towns with their best wealth at war, With help from heaven, have kept the world as yet From working towards its doom too fast or far. And there are some whose lives are out-of-doors, In hopeful spots the Cross and Keys applying, Unfastening there from Earth's green shining floors The ponderous curse that hath so long been lying O'er its hushed fields, bewildering heathen guess With intricate, unmeaning loveliness. XCVI.SCENERY HUNTING. Light multitudes! O spare the weary seas, That like tired subjects bear you year by year. Europe stands wondering on her spacious quays, With face half-doubting whether smile or tear Would fittest greet the Englishman's disease. Strange people! flung like spray from summer tides In leafy places and o'er green hill-sides! Substance fades off to form; each glorious thing, Wherein ancestral wisdom was enshrined, Whereto imaginative power might cling With Christian hold, is shed upon the wind. Man, made of earth, from earth will strive to bring O'er his dull lifetime the receding light Of the Eternal and the Infinite. XCVII.TO A PUPIL. Brother! we left the port of our new birth At different times; yet hath our coasting been Along a lovely quarter of the earth, Where the calm bays are blue, and sea-banks green. Now, be it cloudy time or shining weather, Our barks are anchored for a while together. Somewhat in river-mouths have I been taught With inland winds for teachers,—somewhat too, Belike less heeded, from old volumes brought By angel hands to give me nature's clue. By gentlest incantations round thee thrown, Come, let me tinge thy spirit with mine own,— With more of sweetness, lest life's toils should press Thine over-docile heart and masculine loveliness. XCVIII.RICHARD'S TREE. WATERPARK, CONISTON. By what strange lure are thy free spirits bound, With thy bare feet and wonder-smitten face, Close to this mountain ash, as if to trace Thine infant foot-prints in the grass around? Ah! little Boy, since thine unsteady pace Wore round its guiding stem a yellow ring, Hot sun and dewy moon have clothed the place Anew with their alternate visiting. Even through eight thin years there is a past, Which speaketh to thee in thy childish spirit, And thy fresh soul hath mighty shadows cast From the dark store our nature doth inherit. Long may this tree, unpruned for thy dear sake, Wave to the merry splashing of the lake! XCIX.THE DEATH OF RICHARD'S TREE. WATERPARK, CONISTON. Why comest thou to me, young questioner, Why comest thou with sorrow-stricken look? Of what dread omen in old nature's book Enquirest thou the meaning from the seer? From out yon sapless tree thy mother earth Speaks to thee, Child, and with no voice of mirth. Life grows around thee and upon thee, deep And broad and mighty; and the time hath come When childhood pure can be no more a home, A covert where the soul may hide and sleep. Yet still—now dry thy tears—this comfort take; Thou shalt keep childhood's heart with manhood's soul; There shall be pauses from life's stern control When thou shalt hear the old mirth of the lake. C. WRITTEN IN CONWAY CASTLE. England! thy strifes are written on thy fields In grim old characters, which studious time Wears down to beauty, while green nature yields Soft ivy-veils to clothe gray holds of crime, And hides war's prints with spring-flowers that might wave Their pale sweet selves upon a martyr's grave. Here hath the ploughshare of the Conquest worn The furrowed moat around a cruel tower; There York's white roses fringe in blameless scorn The ledge of some Lancastrian lady's bower. Least, for my country's sake, may I regret The fruitful angers, and good blood that ran So hot from Royalist and Puritan, Which in our very soil is red and throbbing yet. CI. OLD-FASHIONED HOUSES. FOR A LADY FOND OF OLD FURNITURE. Sweet are old Courts with dates above the doors, And yew-trees clipped in shapes, and cedar walks, And lawns whereon a quiet peacock stalks, And leaden casements, and black shining floors, And arm-chairs carved like good cathedral stalls, And huge French clocks, and bedsteads most inviting, And stiff old ladies hung upon the walls, Famed in the days of English Memoir-writing:— Places whose very look kind thoughts might draw E'en to Anne Stuart or William of Nassau. Sweeter than Tudor-stricken shrines are they, With pleasant grounds and rivers lingering by,— Quaint homes, that shed a pure, domestic ray O'er the dull time of English history. CII. THE MENAI BRIDGE. Fairest of rocky England's channel-gates! With what a blessed calm to the main ocean The ebbing tide, with silent under-motion, Upward is drawn along thy weedy Straits! The glossy water, shot with blue and green, Throws off the sunlight, like the restless throat Of some vain dove; and ships, methinks, might float, Trusting the deep in places so serene. Thus wreathed in folds of summer billow, who Would deem old tales of wreck and tempest true, Where yon vast Marvel, like an albatross Still springing upward, as it seems, in air, Spreads in light grandeur his huge wings across, Self-poised in momentary balance there? CIII.CHURCH POSTURES. Ye would not sit at ease while meek men kneel Did ye but see His face shine through the veil, And the unearthly forms that round you steal Hidden in beauteous light, splendent or pale As the rich Service leads. And prostrate faith Shroudeth her timorous eye, while through the air Hovers and hangs the Spirit's cleansing Breath In Whitsun shapes o'er each true worshipper. Deep wreaths of Angels, burning from the East, Around the consecrated Shrine are braced, The awful Stone where by fit hands are placed The Flesh and Blood of the tremendous Feast. But kneel—the priest upon the Altar-stair Will bring a blessing out of Sion there. CIV.SNOWDON, IN THE PASS OF LLANBERIS. Holding by this rude crag I stay to listen, Where the white noonday moon looks o'er the steep, And sheets of mountain water hang and glisten, Catching the sun far up in their long leap. Snowdon's whole range is rocking in the wind, Ridges and splintered caves and lifeless vales, Calling forth mighty sounds, while they unbind The echoing chords of this vast harp of Wales. Forget not Whom the winds forth-shadow! Hark, How the huge hills take up in hollows dark The clang from these distracted caverns tossed, Till the brave eagles in their holds have trembled, Crouching and screaming to the choir assembled Round this dread Altar of the Holy Ghost. CV.NIGHTS FOR POETS. I Is night fairest among mountains And by the rushy lea, Or cradled on the fountains Of the unpolluted sea? II Does moonlight come most brightly Unto the white-faced steep, Or when it wanders lightly In sweet paths o'er the deep? III Are stars most pure when making Jewels for mountain crest, Or with their shadows shaking In ocean's pearly breast? IV Is darkness grander covering A mountain's hollow dells, Than when it droopeth hovering Upon the broad sea-swells? V Be it mountain, be it ocean, When night comes on the earth, If a river's quiet motion Be near me with its mirth. VI Can any toil be sweeter Than for me to lie and dream, And have my time and metre Made for me by a stream? VII Then all night's gentle seemings Into my sleep I take, And a long night's pleasant dreamings Are poems when I wake. CVI.SOFTLY THE SHIPS DO SAIL. TO MY MOTHER. I Softly the ships do sail, Dipping in the billow, Now that the weary gale Findeth there its pillow. II The sea doth lift its plain, Tremulous and shining; Like threads upon the main Glossy wakes are twining. III In twilight rings the calm Binds the current's motion, While evening's inland balm Quivers on the ocean. IV Such calms, such heavenly air Soothe my spirit often, When thy kind eyes are there Chafing thoughts to soften. V By this transparent sea Have I many an even Waited to catch from thee Images of heaven. VI My heart hath oft the while Ceased its very beating, At thine infrequent smile, Beautifully fleeting. VII Mother! in such deep times My heart's harp have I fingered, And words in choicest rhymes Backwardly have lingered. VIII For when I love thee most, Words seem little loving, And golden hours are lost In unwise improving. IX Mother! why is it hard For pardon to be pleading? And why is my heart barred, When thine, alas! is bleeding? X O whisper in my ears— Thy heart for me is aching! Else why those chiding tears In sunshine showers breaking? XI Ah! now my eyes are wet, Hot words must be spoken, For, if they loiter yet, Heart-strings will be broken. XII But why am I to thee All in all, my mother? And why art thou to me Like a sister to a brother? CVII.WELSH VALLEYS. By mountain-pass and long stone-sprinkled alley, Through sweet vicissitudes of barrenness, Our pathway lies,—with scarce a tree to bless The worn wayfarer in the noonday valley. My months have many turns like these, and each Seems to drop down to lowlands broad and winning; But the hills hold them upward: will they reach Ere night the promise of their green beginning? Thus my young life its own poor image takes From bleak Caernarvon's small, unwooded lakes. A man with many homes hath none to spare. Though he beget in calm, rock-shaded places Welcomes, farewells, joys, griefs, and soothing faces, There is no echo to them in the air. CVIII.THE FOUR RELIGIOUS HEATHENS. “Arise, O Lord, let not man be strengthened: let the gentiles be judged in Thy sight.”—Ps. ix, 20. 1.HERODOTUS. “Converse in fear, during the time of your sojourning here.” He was a mild old man, and cherished much The weight dark Egypt on his spirit laid; And with a sinuous eloquence would touch For ever at that haven of the dead. Single romantic words by him were thrown, As types, on men and places, with a power Like that of shifting sunlight after shower Kindling the cones of hills, and journeying on. He feared the gods and heroes, and spake low, That echo might not hear in her light room: He was a dweller underground; for gloom Fitted old heathen goodness more than glow; And, where love was not, faith might gather mirth From ore that glistened in pale beds of earth. 2.NICIAS. “In all these things Job sinned not by his lips, nor spoke he any foolish things against God.” Nursling of heathen fear! thy woful being Was steeped in gentleness by long disease, Though round thine awestruck mind were ever fleeing Omens, and signs, and direful presages. One might believe in frames so gently stern, Some Christian thoughts before their time did burn. Sadness was unto thee for love: thy spirit Rose loftily like some hard-featured stone, Which summer sunbeam never makes its throne, E'en while it fills the skirts of vapour near it. One wert thou, Nicias! of the few who urge Their stricken souls where far-seen death doth hover In vision on them, nor may they diverge From the black line his chilling shadows cover. 3.SOCRATES. “Of making many books there is no end; and much study is an affliction of the flesh.” Thou, mighty Heathen! wert not so bereft Of heavenly helps to thy great-hearted deeds, That thou shouldst dig for truths in broken creeds, 'Mid the loose sands of four old empires left. Motions and shadows dimly glowing fell On thy broad soul from forms invisible. With its plain grandeur, simple, calm, and free, What wonder was it that thy life should merit Sparkles of grace, and angel ministry, With jealous glimpses of the world of spirit? Greatest and best in this—that thy pure mind, Upon its saving mission all intent, Scorned the untruth of leaving books behind, To claim for thine what through thy lips was sent. 4.SENECA. “When Peter came, his shadow at the least might overshadow any of them.” Oft in the crowd and crossings of old Rome The Christ-like shadow of the gifted Paul, As he looked forth betimes from his hired home, Might at this Gentile's hurrying footsteps fall, When, from his mornings in the Cæsar's hall, Spurred by great thoughts, the troubled sage might come. Some balmy truths most surely did he borrow From the sweet neighbourhood of Christ, to bring The harsh, hard waters of his heathen spring In softening ducts o'er wastes of pagan sorrow. As slips of green from fertile confines shoot Into the tracts of sand, so heathen duty Caught from his guided pen a cold, bright beauty, Where flowers might all but blossom into fruit. CIX.VALE CRUCIS ABBEY. I Here, where wet winds autumnal rains may fling, And pallid ash-trees in the transept lean, The gentle-mannered monks were wont to sing The Son of God, the Help of the unclean; And, from Cistercian service books, to hymn The blissful Mother, as the nights grew dim. II Here, not unmindful of the public good, Dwelt some poor beadsmen of the stainless Mary, Bosomed, like monkish spots, in coves of wood, That morn and eve, with mystic commentary, Might for meek hearts re-join the broken threads, Hid in Church books like ore in jealous beds. III And at this hollow, and in vales like this, The winds took in good lading, and a freight Of precious boons, dispensing balm and bliss, Lifting from England's Saxon fields the weight Of sins, that sprung in such prolific brood From the perverseness of her Norman blood. IV Still, within hearing, at pale matin-time There comes a soul into these ruins lone, Where the clean-watered Dee his woodland chime Steers with sweet skill from rich Edeyrnion, Leaving on shady rock and mountain bending Shreds of faint echo waked in his descending. V Oft, when chill winds the compline hour have tolled, The broken East is fairly lighted yet, Ever when in yon Gothic marigold The harmless moon her full white orb hath set, While, on the field beyond, her trembling fire Streams mildly through the triple-windowed choir. VI Thou visitor of ruins! thou mayst come To worn portcullis and green-hooded wall, Where some rude baron held his festal home In moated fortalice or hunting-hall— There thou mayst come, when placid nights are wearing, To learn of earth her art of soft repairing. VII But other thoughts and deeper must be thine, When by poor abbeys, tightly ivied o'er, Thou dream'st that England, leaving Christian shrine, Hath turned herself to druid rite once more,— Fearing in wakeful thoughts lest, heathen grown, She should not miss the Cross when it is gone. CX.ON RECEIVING A LETTER FROM A FRIEND, AFTER AN INTERRUPTED CORRESPONDENCE. I More changes still? And are good hearts like thine Bound to the ebbs and flows of common life? Ah! many a novel thought and random line Show where the world hath harmed thee with its strife. II Still thou art victor; on thy pennon still The Cross and thorny Chaplet are displayed, Though the wet winds of life with evil will Perchance have caused its crimson gloss to fade. III Somewhat of Christian gracefulness hath past From the calm freeness which was thy chief merit; Sadly unwise it was to make such haste, To bring an unripe manhood o'er thy spirit. IV In these few lines of thine, a helpless strife, Somewhat too much unreal, I can trace 'Gainst lingering youth; although thine inner life Hath not as yet worked through upon thy face. V Some men can change their inner lives by power Akin to witchcraft's lawless transmutation, And, by a shock of feeling, in one hour Set their soul's helm to some new constellation. VI Ah woe is me! my life keeps step no more With the old happy hearts it most approves; Outstript by all, it hangs upon the shore, Taking perpetual leave of boyish loves. VII Why ripenest thou thus early? What rich earth Hast thou so lately heaped about thy root? Am I like spendthrift trees in vernal mirth That blossom double, and count that for fruit? VIII Like a watched shrub, my secret life is slow, Built by the four great Seasons as they pass, Curing mine eyes of blindness, while they show The unseen world inverted on their glass. IX My secret growth is slow, by little caught Out on the earth in nights too bright for sleeping, From checks and chills, and gentle tempers brought By the sweet, soothing sight of others weeping. X So, like a forest-tree, screened from the north, And, by the Planter's goodness, free from blight; Some shady branches would I fain put forth, Where sun and wind the backward leaves invite. XI Thus, to be wetted by the showery breeze, Or shined on by the setting sun at even, My boughs might then, piercing through other trees, O'ertop the wood, and so be free of Heaven. XII But, while these fountains of late boyhood run, Wasting cool earth and sheltering moss away, My boughs, drawn upward by the gracious sun, Droop o'er the bole to hear those fountains play. CXI. UP A STREAM OR DOWN. Tell me, young Poet, is it sweeter Up to the heads of streams to travel: Or do you minstrels deem it meeter Their downward flowing to unravel? POET.— From moorland well and heathy hollow The seaward river thou must follow, And trace it slowly till it bend To lowlands round a mountain end; Then through tame dell and cultured plain Past tidewashed cities to the main. There is a moral in its course, Its tranquil depth and rocky force, Its shining shallows, widening lakes, And woody circuits that it takes. Yet down the bank must thou descend, The moral waits thee at the end: For they, who downward rivers trace, Look ocean ever in the face; And man, as youth and age run o'er him, Hath life behind and death before him. The mountain-height where sunset's finger Rejoiceth o'er dull glens to linger; The winds that on the moorlands cross, Sobbing above the barren moss; The clouds that touch on rainy days, Drooping to where the well-spring plays:— All these are types of things that reach The lonely mind that knows not speech, Things that in vision hover by The dreary soul of infancy, When it lays out, unmarred and even, Its little being bare to Heaven. Then, nurtured in the misty homes Of mighty clouds, the current comes, Stretching with many a rushy arm By copsewood and infrequent farm; And every furlong o'er some steep The rainbow-belted waters leap, The time ere tumbling rivers pass To wind about in corn and grass, A time of waste, as cold men deem, When by its banks romancers dream. And this is like the fair beginning Of boyhood, troublesome and winning, Where sunny tempers shine away Converse ill-timed and weary play,— A forward age of noisy beauty Before the cloudy dawn of duty! Mark when the water comes to hallow Rich meadow-flat and barley fallow, And chooses vales with poplar-trees, And visits straggling villages, Clips the broad green where children play, And eats the churchyard earth away. Yet, often leaving fruitful plain, It seeks lone woody spots again, Where every leaf in shadow sleeps Unwaked upon the fishy deeps. And so, when manhood doth begin And toil breeds wealth, and wealth breeds sin, How often is the full-grown being To childish-looking places fleeing, Sweet shelters, where from noontide beams, Wise boyhood hides some dewy dreams; For who can see rain-scented woods Drying their branches in the sun, But straightway to the heart whole floods Of aimless, rhymeless lyrics run? And fairy fish in silver mails, Or girt with moonlight-coloured scales, Where under-water beds are bright, Will glance and gleam and scatter light;— Just like the thoughts that leap to life In spirits parched with trade and strife, When on the surface from below Old childish wells break up and flow, And cowslips mixed with may-flowers grow. Then, where upon some inland bower, Salt tides encroach with brackish power, 'Tis like the taste that ill-health brings From the broad grave's close-lying springs, When age in times of failing breath Doth freight itself with thoughts of death. And river mouths have shapes so many, Narrow and deep, or broad and fenny, With rocky bar or easy gate Or currents clashing in a strait, That thou mayest well in these descry The rude or gentle deaths men die. Tell me, young Priest! will it be sweeter The downward flowing to unravel, Or must we Christians deem it meeter Up to the heads of streams to travel? PRIEST.— The poet hath blithe answer made; My words must travel more in shade. Where less of earth's wild show is given There may perchance be more of Heaven. Yet priests, like poets, have an eye For radiant earth and changeful sky, And mightier signs mayhap can trace In river-nook and green-wood place. The seasons with four currents flowing Are all but symbols coming, going, Translucent shades for ever passing, Disjointed parts of Eden glassing. For it were strange absolving word On sinning soul should so be heard, Yet have no power to lift from earth Green dazzle and bewildering mirth, Till she gives up to flesh and spirit The secret lore they both inherit, When in the Font's rich-sparkling round The Key with golden wards is found. To moorland well and heathy hollow The upward river thou must follow, Nor stay one hour in tideways brown, By granite quay and toiling town; But, mounting on to cultured plain, Reached by faint murmurs from the main, Urge on, star-guided still by duty, Through lands of rough sequestered beauty, And rest on eagle-haunted fell Where rings of hollow mosses swell, And the young streamlets as they rise Catch their first tint from mountain skies. For they, who streams to fountains trace, Look uplands ever in the face, Leaving Death's type, the ocean gray, Inaudible, and leagues away: And man, as youth and age run o'er him, Hath death behind and life before him. Thou cam'st from an eternal womb, Timid and tongue-tied from the gloom; Thou walkedst an eternal shore, And heard'st eternal waters roar, And gather'dst shells which thou didst keep, And bring with thee from yonder deep. And thou thyself, like ocean shell, Bearest within thee still a swell, Which thy charmed hearing never may In dryest inlands put away. Ere from that ocean thou didst steer, Where beauty walking leaned on fear, Some branches of a mystic Tree Were cast by prophets in the sea, And Angels little cups did bring Of cold sweet water from a spring, And life went from the cups, and Breath That breathed another face on death. Then wert thou taught to hang and ride, Like steadfast fish, against the tide, Lifted by wind and lured by gleam Upward to wrestle with the stream, And with unearthly health to leap Each cataract and frothy steep. So mayst thou reach thy native fountains, Withdrawn into the sleepless mountains, Unstained in heats by lowing herd, Unsipped by common hedgerow bird, A well upon whose unmarred brink Eagles alone are free to drink, That they may thence their strength renew For wheeling in the pathless blue,— A font where thou canst wash away The dusty stains of summer day, Where health and life still hover by, And where alone 'tis safe to die. Fair are the plains where corn-fields bend, And flowers and grass in meadows blend, And calm the smell at eventide When breezes o'er the bean-field glide, And rich and lulling airs are blent At noon from languid clover sent,— Sweet pauses that at times may hallow The dreary ridge and dusky fallow. Yet from these scenes of harmless wealth Good men rise upward still for health, And slower, for the stream is quickest, They mount where copse and heath are thickest,— The boyish time of rivers, where, By heavy dews and keen fresh air, Old Heaven with infant splendour seems To pass once more into their dreams, Late years when out of ancient truth The Christian wins a second youth. And Christian age full fain will press To world-neglected dreariness, Where barren hills with naked line, Like sabres' dinted edges, shine, And lucid shadows calmly brood As spirits o'er the solitude; And sight and sound have freedom given That hath a very taste of heaven. So, gentle questioner! mayst thou Attain thy native mountain-brow, And from its ether-cinctured height Look into lands of promised light. Then to the Font beneath descend, And o'er its tranquil pulses bend, Recovering from its dewy earth What life hath marred of childhood's mirth. When evening shadows round thee glide Death will come calmly to thy side, Sent, with light hand, low voice, to gather The children back unto their Father. With gentle sob drawn in once more That spring upon another shore Shall rise, as fresh as waters vernal, With spirit-pulses, and eternal. Come, upward walk to moorlands gray Where springs gush out from mountain root, There let thy being sink away Beneath the Font's stone-sculptured foot. And, like waste water from its round, Be poured on consecrated ground. CXII.TO THE MEMORY OF A TOWN-PENT MAN. Farewell, kind Spirit! Like a summer cloud With no ungentle gloom hath death come down All calmly on the sunshine of old age: And now thou sleepest. From the far-off land Of hills and rivers thou didst love in youth, Perchance upon thy dying ear there fell Voices and mystic sounds with cadence strange, That spoke in thrilling echoes of the time Of youth's high breathings, manhood's energies. Or thoughts, long since forgotten, then came in, Came through the obscure posterns of the soul, And thy strong frame was stirred; and in thine eyes There went and came a childlike simpleness; While ever and anon a heavenly light (Such would I deem the birthplace of those looks That pass upon the features of the sick) Flashed forth in broken gleams, chasing away The films of death; even like the voiceless breeze That comes with twilight shadows from the hills, Dimpling the lucid breast of some deep lake. Thy lot was hard, benevolent Old Man! Most hard indeed! Thou wouldst have pitched thy tent, (A simple tent as for an out-door man, A man of the fresh air and merry skies) Where some lone streamlet wells from out its urn Of moss-clad rock, there gladly listening The quiet music of the mountain winds; And tuning thy full soul to such high themes As most befit an ardent worshipper At nature's inmost shrine; and feeding thence Thy natural cheerfulness with those fair forms That move in peaceful gladness on the earth, Or float like golden vapors through the air, Mutely, yet not without significance. Thy lot was hard, benevolent Old Man! Thou of the quiet eye and frolic tongue! Most hard indeed! Within the city pent, That huge and troublous city, thou didst walk A cheerless exile from thine own bright land. There thy soul sickened at man's selfishness: Thy heart recoiled upon itself; for men Knew not the language that it spake: they spurned Those striving hopes and phantasies and loves, Which were thy real world; for thou hadst been A priest in nature's temple, while the crowd Were hurrying on to those dull clamorous halls, Where cold suspicion hath usurped the throne, The ancient throne of wisdom, and hath taught Her baneful lessons of distrust and pride, And severed all our old ancestral bonds, Whereby deep social love was symbolized, And in the bosom of our social state Somewhat of moral grandeur was detained. All this was heavy on thee, mild Old Man! A mournful gloom was round thy spirit hung, Of which the dusky veil of that great town Were no inapt resemblance: yet not so Wert thou a man to shun the company Of thy less gifted brethren; though thy soul Yearned for the open fields and liberal air To wander, fancy's freeman. As the sun, That struggles all day long with autumn fogs, Shrouds in a misty mantle his bright form, Then darts his evening splendors far and wide O'er hill and dale; so from thy spirit's gloom A native gaiety of heart broke forth With a most happy lustre, which dispelled The clouds of sadness gathered on thy brow. But no man hath a lot of unmixed ill; And thou hadst surely much of tranquil mirth, And many quaint enjoyments, shared by none, And instincts of a wisely wayward kind, And ill-assorted sympathies, from whose Strange medley thou couldst moral order bring. Thine was a quiet heart; clear thoughtfulness Was visible upon that open brow. For kindly nature never did forget Her worshipper, but sent unto his soul, Ay, even in the jostling of the streets, Impulses, such as on the mountain tops In early youth he had received, or felt In wandering amid forest sanctities, When not a leaf in the green depths was stirred. Thus, as he walked along the crowded streets, He was not of the crowd,—as many more Perchance were not, by hopeless love assailed, Or by fresh sorrow severed from the herd, Or holy errand. For all-powerful love, Grandeur, and her twin-sister beauty, there Were with him. From her ancient classic haunts Ideal grace was summoned to attend. And, whereso'er he moved, voices and forms, Voices most deeply musical, and forms Of dazzling brightness, fell on his pleased ear, And floated in calm pomp before his eyes. And he was thankful too for many a gift Which nature ministered in that dull town: Green trees in nooks where green trees should not be, The sun upon the high housetops, the vanes Of the tall churches struck with merry rays, Bright creatures in a region of their own— The bubbling of cold water, and the gleam, Half sad, half sunny, of the morning Thames. Nay, we have that within ourselves, from which We can create the world without,—wherewith Sorrow doth make her hills and trees and streams, And joy and hope their other hills and streams. Oh happy, thus companioned as thou wert, Thus visited, thus solaced, thus endowed! How shall I liken thee, kind spirit! thou A separated being among men, A foreigner among wild squares and streets, And raised on high above the ebb and flow Of city life! Upon the crowded quays, Where hearts are turned to stones, still visited By feelings and by thoughts that come from far And are eternal, in the which a seed Of endless, immaterial life is laid,— Unrecognized thou still didst walk along. Once I remember when the breathing land Was ringing with the early voice of spring, The valleys still in night's most sable hues Were steeped; but one huge, awful peak, that stood A kingly eminence above the rest, I then beheld all diademed with light, Crowned with the sunrise, marvellously crowned; And clouds with yellow hems hung round its brow, Vestments of the unseen ambassadors From the great sun to earth: so too wert thou: Thou hadst mysterious messages and songs Come to thee from a distant realm of dreams; And delicate creations from thee sprang Graceful and radiant as the clouds at dawn. Farewell, Old Man! For I may call thee old, Though time's soft, onward flight had not yet reached The limit of our days. The seasons four, That on the shining pathway of the year Glide forward in their magical array, Had many moons to fill before the term Named for the life of man. Still thou wert old, Agèd before the time with such old age As the sick heart best knows, when chilling frosts Have nipped the bud that promised once so much, And struck the trustful blossom from the bough. Years onward fly; but what heart heeds the flight? It keeps its own sad calendar, and marks Its powers grow dull, its feelings intermit. May I not call ~ihim~i old, who called his life A dream, and yet outlived that dream? Who lived In a fair land of visions, and whose eye Saw that fair land no more? Was he not old? I dare not to regret thee, mild Old Man! For a cold void was in thy heart; and thou Didst vainly strive by means not sanctified To win oblivion of thy lot. A cloud Passed on thy gentle spirit; thou didst yearn To make thy blood run boundingly again, And oft didst catch in weak-willed eagerness At the receding, many-coloured veil, That severed the hard-featured world and thee. Surely upon thy spirit there had come, As on a little child, fresh in the world, Curious perplexity from sights and sounds, A consciousness thou didst not see aright. But now thou sleepest in the dewy earth, And He, who suffered for thee. bids us hope With a consoling faith that all is well. Farewell, meek Heart! Great Nature's voice is heard, And all the thousand strings of her deep lyre, Sounding a dirge-like song: low-breathing winds Are making plaintive music in the woods, And the clouds cluster round the bleak hill-tops In stately sorrow, bidding man lament In cheerful awe, and put more trust in God! CXIII.IN THE SCHELDT. I. We lay in the dreary Scheldt all night With a bleak south-wester blowing, And we talked of ghosts by the fitful light Of the wood-fire redly glowing. II. I could not sleep, for very deep The words sank in my spirit; And at that hour tales had power Above their own true merit III. The waves were high on the sandbanks nigh, And the dismal river flowing, And a muttering sound from the swampy ground, Like the murmur of babes, was blowing; And the only mirth of the household earth Were the cocks in Flushing crowing. IV. I cannot boast that a white wan ghost To me seems an idle error; For deep in me, as the deep, deep sea Are the fountains of holy terror. V. I knew when I heard the stormy bird All round about us crying, That spirits strong were riding along To the beds of sinners dying. VI. O Angels bright! what an angry night Is this for the powers of evil; And thousands there, in the blustering air, Are keeping unholy revel. VII. The good might cross themselves for fear, As they heard the seabirds yelling, And the chattering voicelike sounds that came On the breath of the tempest swelling. VIII. Though well they know good Angels go The Saints from harm to cover, And by their beds around their heads With wings of glory hover. IX. O may they keep us in our sleep To-night on this savage river, And, for their Master's sake, our souls From the spirits of ill deliver! CXIV. TO MY INDIAN SISTER. I A blessing on thee, Sister dear! A blessing! whether far or near, In city bright or desert drear Thy path may lie, Since we may not detain thee here Beneath our sky. II Yet ah! that thou with us couldst be! For England's homes are fair to see, And most our northern homes to me All brightly shine— Still brighter when enjoyed with thee Sweet love! and thine. III Each season has its tale to tell, Like pleasant chimes upon a bell; And memory feeds on what befell In days departed, When thou wert laughing, bright, and well, And careless-hearted. IV The summer came with leafy May, And sweetly sank the summer day On ruined Finchale's abbey grey And its tall woods, And brightly did the sunbeams play On Weare's wild floods. V And holy Durham's minster fair A crown of yellow rays did wear, And we beheld with rapture there, By sunset's powers Transfigured in the radiant air, The two west towers. VI O seldom, seldom upon earth Doth one short evening bring to birth Such innocence and yet such mirth, As then were mine: I never knew a light heart's worth Till I knew thine! VII Oft on the mind a day like this Rests with a moonlight thought of bliss, Softly as lies a mother's kiss On childhood's brow: I little thought how I should miss My sister now! VIII God bless thy little ones and thee, And blessèd may thy True Love be! Far as thou art across the sea, My prayers shall rise,— Prayers that shall bring thee back to see Our English skies! CXV.SUNLIGHT AND MOONLIGHT. Sunlight and Moonlight! these two glories reach Into our souls from our first day and night; And we live afterwards on what they teach, Finding our way by their two kinds of light. Our Sunlight is the steadfast radiance cast Thro' true church-windows, lustrous and unfading, Where Creed and Rite thro' life give light, and last. But that sweet Moon, that perils oft our lading, Lures the good ship astray, then sinks hard by, Leaving gray water where its light was thrown; Or hangs, midway between the sea and sky, O'er some fair earthly haven of its own. Love is the Moonlight of our lives, and takes All hearts to the soft shadows that it makes. CXVI.THE ECHO ON OXENFELL. A MORAL. I My Sister! do not deem me rude, If I have turned my head aside Nor to thy loving words replied In this hill solitude. II Darkness all round us deeply presses; No starlight wavers to the earth, No breeze is born of moonlight mirth To part night's cloudy tresses. III No sound comes to us from the steep, No watercourse is speaking now; The very nightbirds on the bough Forget themselves and sleep. IV The sky above of gloomiest blue Doth seem to pause above the heath, And, lest it wake some grassy breath, Withholds her gift of dew. V Silence herself sweet sound desires, And with her heavy hush is mingling Somewhat of an impatient tingling, Like chords of shaken lyres. VI Poor echo round each hollow stone In this dark desert space is feeling For every noise that might come stealing For her to feed upon. VII Thou with thy words my name didst twine, My Christian name, a sound the sweetest, And of all names for echo meetest When breathed by lips like thine. VIII I heard the stir thy whispers made, And paused to see if on the heath Echo would find that wandering breath,— Half glad and half afraid. IX I thought perchance my name might wake In airy places echo's soul, The dull-eyed midnight to console With sounds from bush and brake. X And yet I had a fluttering fear, Lest wicked echo on the air To all the lakes my name should bear, And tell that we were here. XI First it would have a rocky sound, And then a trembling leafy tone, And harsh again by rugged stone, And up from underground. XII And so from wood and heath and hollow, Striking in single notes and double, With babbling speed the breezy trouble Cliff-side and brook would follow. XIII And ere the dawn could dapple heaven, Old men and boys might catch the tale, From Harter Fell to Ennerdale, From Bassenth waite to Leven. XIV Yet what did peevish echo do? She sate on every heap of stone, And let those syllables alone, As they went floating through. XV And now a gleam came up the lea, And as the tardy moon was rising, I murmured silently, advising Myself much more than thee,— XVI What thing less heeded can we find By all mankind than selfish Self? Echo will teach us, wayward elf!— That same Self by mankind! CXVII.CARL RITTER. I O hadst thou seen Carl Ritter, wan and pale, Walking at eve with melancholy mien, Drinking the music of the nightingale With fierce delight, where on the current green Of Leipsic's moat the water-lilies sail In snowy fleets, thou wouldst have burned, I ween, To know somewhat of the sad history Of that wild foot-step and dejected eye. II Love—who could doubt it?—in his being wrought Hotly and hopelessly; and he had rued, But all too late, the passion's sultry drought, Which dried youth's wells that cannot be renewed. And there he walks, or rather runs, by thought, Like old Actæon by his dogs, pursued; So is it ever: love-sick hearts confound The world within them with the world around. III How bright is evening on the battle-plain Which spreads round Leipsic like a misty sea! A thousand larks drop down into the grain, Foregoing one by one their minstrelsy: Sickness and age returns of strength might gain From objects, all so tranquil and so free; But for the ills of unrequited love There is no balm, but mercy from above. IV See how the rose and eglantine are threading Through all the openings in the acacia leaves! The massive chestnuts their white flowers are shedding On the still moat; the red verbena weaves Mats for the lawn we are so rudely treading; Nought in this garden, save Carl Ritter, grieves, And he is not from his unquiet wooed By the sweet sights wherewith he is pursued. V O evening! softest power! hast thou no wind— From violet bank or trellised rose no sigh, Which might this clasping load of thought unbind, Touching some other, brighter memory, Or lingering of pure childhood in his mind, To quell the wildfire of that gentle eye? See how he flits, as though this garden glade Elysium were, and he a pensive shade. VI The moon-beam sleeps upon the dusky grass, And with kind equity brings out to light Daisies, in constellations, which did pass Unnoticed when more showy things were bright, And each time that you look again, the mass Is clearer grown, more silvery and more white; Still round and round, and by the slimy moat, Mid trees and flowers Carl Ritter seems to float. VII Student! when wilt thou go unto thy books,— Or dost thou peace in these calm shades discover? See how with brushing 'gainst the lilac nooks, Thy dress with blossoms is besprent all over! How still! save now and then among the rooks From bough to bough one, restless, seems to hover. Yet, in and out, like some dusk-pinioned bird, Carl sails with footsteps scarcely to be heard. VIII There is a square in Leipsic, to the west, A sunny place with soft acacias planted, With one quaint gable taller than the rest, Which Carl inhabited, or rather haunted; With telescopes and some few volumes blest, The love-sick man had all in life he wanted; For where love rules, there is in heart and eye A constant, if not true, simplicity. IX Hither, when midnight three full hours was passed, And starlight had grown weary and outworn, And when the moat by blue mist could be traced Among the lilac thickets,—Carl was borne, By impulse, rather than by will at last, Cold and fatigued, and therefore less forlorn. The sharp sound of the key within the lock, Shook the still square with momentary shock. X The sun is up; the larks are in full choir; How perfectly they sing—how perfectly! And o'er the champaign many a hazy spire Shoots up from out the undulating sea Of the green corn; and wavering, like a fire, Far off there is a single chestnut tree; There will I tell what I of Carl have heard In triple falls of rhyme, and simple word. XI And in the pauses of the song we may Be soothed to meditation by the bees, While the blue sky between the leaves doth play, Parted and closed at will by this soft breeze: And Leipsic, with red roofs and turrets gay, Blended with churches, ramparted with trees, May seem a show more touching and more fair, Because that stricken heart is drooping there. XII There, mid his books, Carl withers like a flower, Alternately by love consumed, and ruth That he should so have wasted hour by hour The fresh and genial faculties of youth, Which ever draw their beauty and all power From cheerfulness, the foster-child of truth. They who, when young, are spendthrifts of sweet sadness, Lose unawares the spring of later gladness. XIII Yet Carl, as they who knew him best could say, In middle life was not an idle man; Philology half filled his studious day, And eastern grammars would he fondly scan; While with the suffering poor his heart found play In many a kind device and secret plan. Thus did he light's best hours for duty keep, And gave to love but what he stole from sleep. XIV At Magdeburg, within the Minster-yard, From the great tawny Elbe not far remote, There stands a house detached; the eye is barred All access to that jealous shaded spot, Whose habitants are kept in pleasant ward In the small ring of their close garden-plot; And there the murmur of the neighbouring quay Dwells, like the humming of a drowsy bee. XV If privileged to enter, you might see How the laburnum its gilt pendants swung All inwards to a sweet-breathed walnut tree, To which a trumpet honeysuckle clung, And up whose stem the turf crept amorously, Framing a mossy slope, on which was flung A drooping shade, with leafy curtains drawn All round, a natural tent upon the lawn. XVI It was a lowly place, a sylvan home Within the city; and there Blanea dwelt, Carl's widowed mother, and to her had come A friend of early years, one who had felt The same bereavement; and they two would roam Through the cool minster's aisles, and often knelt, The only week-day worshippers, alone, Screened from chance eyes by some sepulchral stone. XVII And in the morning, punctual to the hour When o'er the lawn the minster's shade was cast, The two meek dames, like seamen with no power To leave the deck, their narrow garden paced. At sunset Blanca watered every flower, Always the trumpet honeysuckle last, While with keen search Antonia nipped away The blooms that were unsightly through decay. XVIII And round them neatness reigned to an excess At which a busy man might smile, well-pleased, And not in shallow scorn; for mournfulness Must wreak itself on trifles, to be eased By dissipating thought; the laying stress On little things the heart hath often teased From greater griefs, and hath deluded sorrow By giving forward interests to the morrow. XIX Habit was their absorbing virtue, test And measure of all goodness; order grew A superstition, carefully confessed By services minute the whole day through. Yet scorn not thou the widows: greatly blest Are they who, by observance meek and true, Duty, albeit of least dimensions, fill With large affections and submissive will. XX Within this narrow ring of joy and fea Antonia's daughter, like a radiant star, Wandered, or banished from her proper sphere, Did with the plants divide the matron's care; For her plain virtues she to them was dear, And what of higher bent they could not share They took on faith, and loved her all the more Because to her lone height they could not soar. XXI Her hair hung down in ringlets long and pale; She was not lovely—so the world would say— But yet so delicate, a summer gale Might almost waft the sylph-like flower away: Her voice, for one of form so very frail, Was full of depth and richness; and there lay Couched in its fervid tones, an evidence Of somewhat more than met the outward sense. XXII And momentary feeling would excite Within her eyes a look of bold command, A fire, from time to time revealed, which might By some quick deed, as by enchanter's wand, Transform her being, to the withering light Of jealousy and vengeful passion fanned. This smothered heat, in look and accent breathed, Was from her sire's Calabrian blood bequeathed. XXIII Else never was there on the earth a maid, More gentle than the orphan Helena, Nor one with mien more gracefully arrayed In lovely self-distrust, that could give way With sweet facility; a pensive shade, Almost a trick of melancholy, lay Deep in her, blending lowly thoughts with high, As though it were her being's harmony. XXIV Maids are there whom with wonder we behold, Frail, bending creatures, drooping evermore Beneath the pressure of soft thoughts; yet bold, And ready on undaunted wing to soar Into life's highest regions, and unfold Strength and resistance, and a hidden core Of hardy virtues, which, like spirits, start From some unknown abyss within the heart. XXV Hearts are they which an unkind word may break, Yet with an inward faculty of pride, Or power which might a chaster title take, When to nobility of thought allied;— Hearts whose sublime endurance nought can shake, By womanly devotion sanctified,— Women who have men's burden strangely borne Without one feminine gentleness forsworn. XXVI And such was Helena. But in our youth Ofttimes a circumstance or accident Lurks, overlaid, as though it were in sooth A thing for no great end or purpose meant; To which belongs a destiny and truth Hereafter verified, whereby the bent Of our first years is strained, their promise lost, The under-current mounting uppermost. XXVII And fearful is the agency of love In these transfigurations of the heart: On it all passions are constrained to move,— The point from which a second life must start. And with fair Helena did it so prove; It set her childish being far apart, And woke, as spring wakes flowers from out the earth, The slumbering fires of her Italian birth. XXVIII But all unconscious then of that dread power, Tender, nay languid, from excessive shade, Yet the more lustrous, grew that lily-flower, No kindred nigh to whom it might unlade The dew within its cup, a fertile shower Of confidence and sweet repinings, made To flow upon the friendships of our youth, Lest feeling, overfed, become untruth. XXIX Fair Helena! she grew from day to day As in a convent, all unmurmuring; And not an image to her heart found way Which did not from that narrow household spring. The turf which 'neath the drooping walnut lay Was not a softer, more alluring thing, Than, in her bower disclosed, this pensive maiden, Her spirit with unconscious beauty laden. XXX Ah me! it was a most endearing sight To see how self-suspicion ever strove, Yet vainly, in her thoughts; she felt delight, But whence she knew not, somewhat too of love More than was asked of her in filial right. She brooded o'er herself like some lone dove, Or eastern shepherdess her fountain keeping, Beneath a palm-tree's cloud-like shadow sleeping. XXXI Thus life stood still with her; 'twas scarce forlorn, For there was no abiding sense of want, Save that a trouble or a joy half-born, And a blind hope, so oft love's pursuivant, Rose in her dreams and woke with her at morn, And somehow more and more her heart did haunt,— A presage, to our youthful spirit dear, Of some new world of change and fortune near. XXXII Thus Carl and Helena grew side by side Through childhood's long and uneventful years, Playmates, in all endearing tasks allied: Joys were not joys, and hopes were almost fears, To one, unless received and magnified Within the other's heart; from smiles and tears, The income of our youth, the pair laid by Hoards of sweet thought and fragrant memory. XXXIII One difference there was; young Helena Called Carl her brother, while the tender boy Gave her the name of sister; and there lay In that distinction a deep-seated joy, Though why they knew not; but their minds would play With this one separation, and would toy With the soft syllables, as though to strain Such sweetness from them as they might contain. XXXIV Childhood to boyhood rose: Carl's studies now Were in another and more manly vein: And from the one distinction soon did flow Surmises of great evils, to restrain The too swift growths of joy; yet even so, It grew more dear when it brought more of pain: And brother now to Helena became A something fuller than a tender name. XXXV So far they had been like a mated pair Of childish hearts, betrothed in infancy; As in earth's simple days they ofttimes were, Grafting the step of love upon a tie Hallowed of God, that it might fasten there As a true growth of natural piety,— A wise deceit, which made a brother's name For years a spell love's wild excess to tame. XXXVI O rarest leaf in fortune's golden book! O sweetest trap! to win a gentle maid, On whom our earthly innocence did look As on a sister, with whom we have played, Erred, wept, and striven, and have many a nook Of pensive recollections, in whose shade A covert love may grow, a furtive plant, Spreading like lilies in a woodland haunt! XXXVII The self-paired flowers of wedded infancy, Which shape themselves unto each other's growth, By fate are often frustrated, and die O'ershadowed in ungenial ground, as loath With their pure native grace to feed the eye Which blights them with its love, as passion doth:— Ah! cruel sires! who thus transplant a flower Which throve so well beneath a humbler bower! XXXVIII How lightly mounts the tyrant love his throne! No pomp of installation there doth move. And thus with Carl the gentle thrall had grown To a sweet bondage, while his passion wove Dreams which cold hope would scarcely dare to own; 'Twere long to tell how from a brother's love That passion shot, and grew in depth and length, Fed hourly with fresh increases of strength. XXXIX When Carl to Leipsic went, how passing strange Was the new melancholy of farewell, Nor without sweetness in the interchange Of murmured words, which inwardly did swell Too large for utterance then, or of a range Too wide, too free, for bashful tongue to tell. Poor Helena! no words which she could borrow Would half fulfil the measure of her sorrow. XL And her love ripened fast in loneliness; Yet it appeared the same old love to her, Run wild for want of speech, and through the stress Of absence: she grew somewhat waywarder Than heretofore; and oft could not repress The rising image and the sudden stir Of tenderness which made the tears to flow; And still she deemed it right it should be so. XLI Antonia saw it not; she gathered still The blooms the honeysuckle shed away. Kind Blanca as devoutly did fulfil Her round of modest duties every day. Alas! for age, if those hearts lose the skill To know true love who once have been his prey! Ah me! it is a grief to mark how soon Noon wipes the morning out, and evening noon. XLII Poor Helena! in her sweet sickness lone, Her thoughts in some vague radiance ever whirled, Now first and fully in her heart had grown The barren knowledge that there was a world, A misty Somewhere whither Carl had gone: Then with the walnut boughs close round her furled, The bees oft soothed her as she did recline, Blowing the trumpets of the eglantine. XLIII Carl, upon change and youthful perils cast, The stern ordeal bravely did endure; And virtue, rooted in a simple past, Grew from each shock more lowly, yet more sure. That sister-love, that image bright and chaste, Enshrined within his fancy kept him pure: Yet much he learned, and much did now appear, Which made the future doubtful and unclear. XLIV The more he thought the more he loved; and yet The more he loved the more did Helena Seem at a boundless distance from him set; And rocks and thorny brakes obscured the way Which love must tread: then he would vainly fret At his own scruples, and deplore the day When good and evil, now more clearly known, Burst through the fence of youth, and broke it down. XLV E'en where there is no guilt the world is strong To uncrown our youth's simplicity, and make The right so near a neighbor to the wrong, That it will oft constrain us to forsake Our blameless ends, lest they perchance, through long Vicinity, of evil should partake: The good we once suspected to be ill Its holy mission doth but half fulfil. XLVI Carl thought of Helena, o'er whom had passed Now barely sixteen summers; to her eye The world could but appear a sunny waste, Whose glistening sands did round their household lie; And he beheld how oft love was abased Before the fresh-seen world, how it would die From a vexed mind, how ill with joys it fared Which had not been with other joys compared. XLVII And was it right? thus in his solitude He daily reasoned—that so young a maid Should be by stealth and at advantage wooed, And her affections prematurely laid Beneath a weight of bonds, full oft bedewed By after tears, when from home's twilight shade On the bright world such hearts are captive thrown, Ere they have yet the effects of freedom known. XLVIII And do not choice and will belong of right To all young hearts, though by self-love denied, Whose passion is not a most pure delight Fed from itself, but is a growth of pride, A base usurper in love's angry sight, By generous restraints unsanctified? Alas for youth! its love is oft a dream, Born of wild wish and hungry self-esteem. XLIX Therefore shall Helena go forth still free; (He little knew how she had all forsworn In his behalf her maiden liberty) Into the world she shall be gaily borne And its brave sights and goodly fortunes see; Yes, she shall see, and for her brother scorn All the delights and lures that are therein; And thus will I my bride, my sister, win! L So reasoned Carl: and manfully he strove Passion and judgment on one line to train: Love mocked at him, and still the more it throve, As though such arts it might full well disdain: And strange to say he did more wildly love, As he of inward calmness more did gain. Ah! piteous lot a tender heart to wither, When love can be both calm and wild together! LI Deem not his reasonings cold, untrue to love: Not unimpassioned is the sober eye Of meek self-sacrifice, though it reprove Fierce ardors. Ah! life's plain reality Is stranger than romance, and far above The tame inventions of old chivalry. Woe worth the heart which cannot nobly win Love's knighthood by foregoing self therein! LII Ere Carl once more to Magdeburg returned The meek Antonia died; and though at first Poor Helena for her lost mother mourned With vehemence, as though her heart would burst, Yet, when her sorrow spent itself, she burned Still more with love, and in her bosom nursed A fire which now no sister-love could be, Though still the name beguiled her pleasingly. LIII And Blanca bade the damsel call her mother; 'Twould soothe her grief the kindly matron thought: And she was soothed; for by this she could smother The hints which lonely musing often brought: And Carl seemed now by double right her brother: Thus self-deceit most innocently wrought, Feeding on contraries, and with sweet skill Assimilating all things to its will. LIV The minster clock tolled four; “He will come soon. Oh! has it not been a most weary day? And yet he said he should arrive at noon.” (And Blanca smiled to hear young Helena) “How we will roam these evenings of dear June, And see the moonlight on the Elbe-stream play! And now our nightly meal once more must be, As in old times, beneath the walnut tree.” LV Thus thought to thought the happy maiden strung With a coherence of her own, and some Sweet thoughts there were not trusted to her tongue, Sweet thoughts which ever would unbidden come, And yet when come were cherished. Blanca hung Carl's bullfinch in the walnut's dusky dome: Even she was won to quiet,—so the thought Of Carl's return in her affections wrought. LVI At length he came, the exile, the estranged, Came to the cottage and the walnut tree. The happy maid! Oh how her fancy ranged When words, entangled in wild thoughts, got free:— How he was changed, and yet he was not changed, But only at first sight had seemed to be. She said and then unsaid a hundred things, Which were to Carl the fanning of love's wings. LVII And he was changed, she saw that he was so; He bore himself to her with courtesy, Which was like coldness after the warm glow Of his old manner; she could not descry In his grave blandishments the genial flow Of playful freedom: there was in his eye A tenderness oh! how unlike her own; Carl was too much, too much a brother grown! LVIII Ah, Helena! the golden hour was come, The long-sought meeting; 'twas a mournful night, Vacant and chilling, like a sudden gloom Upon a radiant scene; all joy, all light Were gone, and love half-prophesied its doom: Still a blind feeling rose,—perchance 'twas right He should so act: and yet with weeping eyes, She was full fain to have it otherwise. LIX O 'tis too sad a song to sing:—they both In wistful silence let the years go by: Carl might have spoken, but was bravely loth To make his gain of her lost liberty. Each deemed the other's love was but a growth Of childhood's old familiarity; And thus all life grew round them like a snare, And dark years rose from years that had been fair. LX Then Blanca went to heaven; and Helena Nursed mid swift growths of loneliness her love, With other grief than filial pined away, Until she was a sight hard hearts to move. Then burst the light on Carl, like break of day, The minster's shadow frowning from above: But she thought pity, not true love, was meant, And so, poor soul! for his sake smiled dissent. LXI Thus to two gentle souls all life was blurred Into one indistinguishable blot; Two destinies had hung upon a word, And out of love that word was spoken not; And when it came, time, life, and hearts had stirred From the right place and the appointed spot. To others the cross-purpose was as light, To them the sun had sunk for life in night. LXII They did not die of broken hearts, like some; But they were larger from being broken, drew More hearts of others to them as a home, And made their sympathy and work more true. They are still young, although old age has come, For sorrow spurs them still to efforts new: And they are now, centres of placid power, Doing the world's work bravely at this hour! CXVIII.TO A MARRIED FRIEND. 1. First love is self-love: a thin shade that starts From out ourselves, its dreamy joys the brood Of base will-worship, that in restless hearts Doth crave to have the loss of youth made good. First love too oft is love without esteem Or mutual honor, seeking in a wife No help, no shelter, but a soothing beam To minister a sunshine to our life:— The growth of one wild hour! and thereof come Dull-hearted unions and a listless home. I have known men to whom it hath been given To make one shipwreck on love's rocky coast, And they have lived to teach, as though from heaven, That he is blest whose first-love hath been crossed. CXIX.O A MARRIED FRIEND. 2. Somewhat of wildness and of weak untruth, And fond abstraction, surely may be borne, Not without ready pardon, in a youth Who hath but for awhile his fetters worn. For the hot heart of youth hath laws: mayhap The seeds of married faith are often cast Upon this surge of hopes, and in the lap Of vernal love may take true root at last. Yet courtship is the unshapely element, Whence the deep power of chaste affection still Must calmly be evoked, till it fulfil The end and nature of a sacrament, And sanctify both spirits from above To be meet vessels of parental love. CXX.THE WINTER RIVER. Low spirits are a rightful penance given To over-talking and unthoughtful mirth. There is nor high nor low in holiest heaven, Nor yet in hearts where heaven hath hallowed earth. Still there are some whose growth is won in strife, And who can bear hot suns through all their life: But rather for myself would I forego High tides of feeling and brief moods of power, Than share those languors with the showy flower, Which the shade-loving herb doth never know. O Brathay! wisely in thy winter grounds, Wisely and sweetly are thy currents chiming, Thus happily to every season timing The same low waters and the same low sounds. CXXI.WRITTEN DURING ILLNESS AT CONSTANTINOPLE. Far o'er green barren Thrace the sun had set In stormy red:—upon a couch of pain, Listening the dripping of the dismal rain,— Over the mighty city, dark and wet, I heard the countless Turkish Ezans swell, Bidding the vespers of the infidel With long, harsh wail from viewless minaret. The Cross lies hard upon my fevered brow And aching frame; and slumber's pleasant spell Is backward o'er my restless limbs to creep. Yet from that Ezan have I learned but now That prayer is sevenfold welcomer than sleep. Then shall I count these little pains a loss Which thus can make the Crescent preach the Cross? CXXII.WHERE THE PINEWOODS WAVE. I Where the pinewoods wave, And the white streams rave, I came in deepest gloom: I hated my youth For its sweet untruth, And laid it in a tomb. I pined for a poet's troubled morrow, And wept, ay, wept for the want of sorrow. II Where the pinewoods wave, And the white streams rave, I came when I was old: For the jar of life Is a gladdening strife Which makes not a poet cold. I had buried my youth hasty and erring,— Oh! have buried days a disinterring? III But the pinewoods waved, And the white streams raved,— They told me in my need, That softness and feeling Were not soul-healing, And so it was decreed,— That the marvellous flowers of Christian duty Should grow on the grave of buried beauty. CXXIII.A SPRING LESSON. I Through all the vale, The primrose pale Her yellow spots is showing; And by the stream Green mosses gleam, Where Scandale Beck is flowing. II Beneath the trees, In families, The snow-drops white are shining; And through the wood Full many a bud Reveals the woodbine twining. III The young fern looks Like shepherd's crooks, As though 'twas such a trouble To force its way Through stones and clay, That it had bent it double. IV And though no screen Of leafy green Protects my happy dwelling, The naked bough Hath thickened now, And bud and branch are swelling: V And it is meant To weave a tent Of summer twilight over, With warp and woof, And all sun-proof, A cool and fragrant cover. VI And from the earth A stream of mirth Into the spirit rises, While sudden Spring From off her wing Is scattering sweet surprises. VII And every hour In vernal shower The heart finds sweet ablution, While it receives Mid buds and leaves A very absolution. VIII Yet do I mourn That spring's bright urn Is no impartial laver, But still that she Most partially Divides her wayward favor. IX For here and there The uncertain air Woos blossoms from their sheathing, Where'er the wind May now unbind The winter with his breathing. X And chosen stems With weight of gems And forward blossoms labor, While not a bud Adorns the wood, The dull wood of their neighbor. XI We cannot ride By yon way-side Among the hawthorns early But fancy grieves O'er spots of leaves Which spring hath wooed unfairly. XII Yet if we scan The world of man In every nook and border, Where'er we turn We may discern The self-same solemn order. XIII Thus in her path Of love and wrath Dear Spring our thanks doth merit: By her meek sign We may divine The mystery of the Spirit. CXXIV.CHRIST THE WAY. I To sin and earth and sorrow tributary, We lift our thoughts to thee, O blissful Mary! Oh! stainless Maid and mightiest Mother! thou Wert the mysterious gate where, stooping low, The King of glory entered, first and last And only One who by that portal passed. To thee our love we offer; while we pray, Poor suitors, unto Him who in thee lay, That we may walk in His new living Way. II Poor suitors are we to thy Son, O Mary! Like us to death and sorrow tributary, But not to sin; and who did deign to call Substance from thee, a Body virginal, And with the Godhead set it side by side, For us vouchsafing to be sanctified: In Person one, of Natures twain: we pray, Poor suitors, unto Him who in thee lay, That we may walk in His new living Way. III We are environed by the world, O Mary! Bondsmen, disconsolate, and tributary; Him, who did once environ thy blest womb, We seek, to cleave our way from out the gloom:— He the strayed soul to its Creator lifts, Replenishing our nature with the gifts Of His own near Divinity: we pray, Poor suitors, unto Him who in thee lay, That we may walk in His new living Way. IV We cannot lift ourselves, O blissful Mary! We to low thoughts, base ends are tributary: We cannot lift ourselves unto the height Of such chaste marvel; for the abounding light, From that exalted Human Body given, Strikes blind the eye too much upraised to Heaven. Man's nature sits with God: to Him we pray, To Him who, God and Man, within thee lay, That we may walk in His new living Way. V O Mother-Maid! O fellow-mortal Mary! Was not thy Son, like mortals, tributary To hunger and to thirst, to hopes and fears? Hath He not sanctified the power of tears, The beauty and the holiness of weeping? Hath He not given back into our keeping A nature newly consecrated? Say, Should we not kneel to Him who in thee lay, Thy womb His road, who is Himself our Way? VI He who within thee lay, O blissful Mary! And to a creature's birth was tributary, Unto the Father yielding back His breath, Gave Himself up a vassal unto death, Death's serf, the three-days' bondsman, and the last, For He hath burst the prison as He passed. Death hath become transparent: let us pray To Him who rent the envious veil away, Breaking through that dread house a living Way. VII And what high bliss hath not thy Son, O Mary! Made to Eve's fallen house hereditary? Man saw Him rise aloft with lucid track, And by that road man still expects Him back. Clear across death and paradise are strown Footprints of light that end but on the Throne At God's Right Hand. Oh let us fall and pray With the great Seraphim that burn all day, Worshipping Man in God, man's living Way. VIII And as He left thee to His Saint, O Mary, Pierced with a sword, woe's meekest tributary, So He bequeathed the Church unto the Spirit To teach her what great things she doth inherit; In which sweet Spirit do we come and go, We risen with Christ, or He with us below, Man ever close to God: oh let us pray, Bending most reverent knees both night and day, To Him, in whom we stand, our present Way. IX Is not His ancient priesthood, blissful Mary! A deep yet most untroubled commentary Upon men's cries and tears by day or night, Pleading all woes before His Father's sight? And for the voiceful Church and poor mute world Doth He not keep His potent Cross unfurled, Lengthening its shadows upon sin? O pray Unto the Priest who ministereth all day, Making His Flesh man's Shelter and his Way. X He is the Priest of priests, O blissful Mary! Whose earthly types with right hereditary, As on the bosom of an unstained sea, Reflect His priesthood in the Mystery Of the dread Altar, giving Flesh for food, Pouring into the frame from urn of Blood The power of resurrection: let us pray To Him whose Five Benignant Wounds all day Stand open to the Church, an awful Way. XI He is our Way, our dreadest Way, O Mary! (May He remember me His tributary!) Our dreadest Way; for it is only given Through His great Judgment-Seat to enter Heaven— Judgment according to our works! the creed Could not be borne were not the Judge indeed A Man of thy true substance: let us pray Unto the Virgin's Son, that in His Day We perish not by that most fiery Way. XII O whitest Flower! O ever-blessèd Mary! To what high purpose wert thou tributary! How wert thou chosen for the stainless Birth, Mother of God! chaste Lily of the earth! Lead us to Jesus, Mother! for us part The veils that hang before the Sacred Heart. All prayers are to thine honor, which we pray To Him who, God and Man, within thee lay, Thy womb His Road, who is Himself our Way! CXXV.THE EASTER GUEST. I Dear Mother! from the sacred cell Where the departed spirits dwell, Mysteriously blest, A gentle shadow, by my side For one whole day at Easter-tide, Thou dost with thy poor orphan bide, A true though speechless Guest. II Dear Shade! at dawn thou dost not come, The hour when Jesus from the Tomb Went in the twilight gray: Thou comest not at sunrise fair, And, when to breathe bright Easter air I leave my bed, thou art not there,— Thou hast not found the way. III Softly, sweet Presence! dost thou steal To me, when all the people kneel With trembling hearts prepared; When, on the Mysteries intent, We see the veil between us rent, Shewing the way that Jesus went,— Then is thy house unbarred. IV And straightway thou art at my side, As when, one long past Easter-tide I knelt, a cowering boy, And thou my little hands didst bare, Taking the gloves which I did wear, Trembling, entranced, oblivious there With awe, deep awe and joy. V Dear Mother! through the long, long year I never think without a tear Of thee so soon departed; And, weariest penance! all the things Which memory from her storehouse brings Are seeds of bitter thought, and stings Which keep me broken-hearted. VI I mark thy sadly wondering look, When in a passion-fit I spoke Harsh words into thine ears; When thou, a sufferer on life's brink, Waitedst to weep, till thou didst think I should not see thy spirit drink Its greedy draught of tears. VII O Mother! Mother! with what pain I crave thy presence back again Thy pardon so to get! For mine is now a growing sorrow, Which doth, alas! for ever borrow From every change and every morrow New sources of regret. VIII But this one day when thou hast come From out thy spiritual home, Thine Easter's endless feast, What other feelings has thou brought! With what a cheering softness fraught! What store, good store, of filial thought Hath come with thee, dear Guest! IX From out thy presence thou dost pour A healing quiet on my sore, The calm of pardon won, And a bright cloud of memories Doth from the genial past arise, Bringing sweet trouble in my eyes, From thoughts of duty done. X Mother! the long, long year I mourn; But thy mute presence is an urn, Replenished from above, Whence yearly there distils a dower Of deep absolving peace, a shower Of benediction,—right and power For penitential love. CXXVI.THE ONE WANT. I One thing is wanting, one bright thing of earth, To fill the cup of life unto the brim, The measure and completion of my mirth, For lack of which days tarnish and grow dim. II O earth! O world! O life! ye should have bred For one like me more sorrow, pain, and fears; Whereas from you, as from a flowery bed, Hath breath, like incense, breathed for all my years. III Wherefore have ye forsworn your nature so? For brittle wills, like mine, have need of stern And hardy baptisms, which can only flow From where pale sorrow bends upon her urn. IV Why should I blame? Ye do your best; ye give What ye can give; and still my heart goes free— Gay thing! it makes the world in which I live, And it is bright, too bright a world for me. V One thing is wanting to me, one bright thing, The which being absent I am poor indeed;— It is my Mother's life, to be a spring Of a more virtuous gladness which I need. VI One thing is wanting in the beamy cup Of my glad life, one thing to be poured in: Aye, and one thing is wanting to fill up The measure of proud joy, and make it sin. VII Through all my life have I been saved by this, This one thing wanting; it hath been the thorn Which kept me calm when I had plucked a bliss From some sweet branch,—one leaf was ever torn. VIII I have been happy, and am happy now, Yet do I crave the most when happiest; For the cold sense of my one want doth grow In the proportion wherein I am blest. IX At the dread Altar, when I might lose sight Of my unworthiness amid the stir Of high and swelling thoughts, it is a blight To pride, that I can be no priest to her. X In the rare moods when I have given birth To songs her memory would have loved to treasure, That she is absent mars the rising mirth, Timing my heart to this life's sober measure. XI When I have walked half giddy on the ledge To which men's praise, like tempters, souls will bear, The want, the single want, hath been the wedge, Cleaving my soul for Heaven to enter there. XII Thus in still nights, in every loneliest haunt Thou, sainted Mother! thou hast rescued me: Daily the Cross hath saved me by a want, And that one want hath been the want of thee. CXXVII.RYDAL VALE. 1. It was the earliest evening of the spring: The hills with vernal green were gently flushed, And every sound about the place was hushed, Except the blue lake softly murmuring. The glow of sunset came there, dusk and rosy; I met a little child in Rydal vale, With a huge bunch of daffodils, a posy Large as the child herself, who was but frail, And hot with climbing, and in all the rills, With both hands clasped, she dipped her daffodils; And ever as she walked she loved to wipe Her face with those wet flowers, and it did please Her simple heart to hear the thrushes pipe, And she would look for them among the trees. CXXVIII.RYDAL VALE. 2. Thou wilt be long in reaching home, my love! If thou dost tarry all the joys to take, Crowded this evening about Rydal lake,— The new-born lambs, the flowers, the cooing dove. Nay, wherefore grasp thy daffodils so fast? I am not one to rob thee: thou hast wrought So deeply in my heart that thou hast brought Sweet gifts of tears unto me from the past. My sainted Mother! was I once like this, A creature overflowed with simple bliss, One whom thou might'st have seen by these bright rills Long years ago when thou wert in this place, Stooping to cool his little health-flushed face, So wondrous happy with his daffodils? CXXIX.THE WOUNDED LAMB. I saw a shepherd with a wounded lamb, Which he had found in pain and almost dead Among the blue stones upon Rydal Head, Where, plaintive tenant of the moor, the dam With sorrow in her large round eyes was left, Of that white, gleaming creature now bereft. The village children gathered in a ring, Doubtful, as round some disenchanted spell: For three days they had seen it wandering A bodily sunbeam on the rocky fell. It puzzles them to think that on the morrow That patch of light will not be up on high; Yet do they love it more, for common sorrow Begets in wonder's stead sweet sympathy. CXXX.A COTTAGER'S CHILD. I met a child, and kissed it: who shall say I stole a joy in which I had no part? The happy creature from that very day Hath felt the more his little human heart. Now when I pass he runs away and smiles, And tries to seem afraid with pretty wiles. I am a happier and a richer man, Since I have sown this new joy in the earth: 'Tis no small thing for us to reap stray mirth In every sunny wayside where we can. It is a joy to me to be a joy, Which may in the most lowly heart take root; And it is gladness to that little boy To look out for me at the mountain foot. CXXXI.SUNDAY. I There is a Sabbath won for us, A Sabbath stored above, A service of eternal calm, An altar-rite of love. II There is a Sabbath won for us, Where we shall ever wait In mute or voiceful ministries Upon the Immaculate. III There shall transfigured souls be filled With Christ's Eternal Name, Dipped, like bright censers, in the sea Of molten glass and flame. Apoc. xv. 2. IV Yet set not in thy thoughts too far Our Heaven and Earth apart, Lest thou shouldst wrong the Heaven begun Already in thy heart. V Though Heaven's above and Earth's below, Yet are they but one state, And each the other with sweet skill Doth interpenetrate. VI Yea, many a tie and office blest, In earthly lots uneven, Hath an immortal place to fill, And is a root of Heaven. VII And surely Sundays bright and calm, So calm, so bright as this, Are tastes imparted from above Of higher sabbath bliss. VIII We own no gloomy ordinance, No weary Jewish day, But weekly Easters, ever bright With pure domestic ray; IX A feast of thought, a feast of sight, A feast of joyous sound, A feast of thankful hearts, at rest, From labor's wheel unbound; X A day of such homekeeping bliss As on the poor may wait, With all such lower joys as best Befit his human state. XI He sees among the hornbeam boughs The little sparkling flood; The mill-wheel rests, a quiet thing Of black and mossy wood. XII He sees the fields lie in the sun, He hears the plovers crying; The plough and harrow, both upturned, Are in the furrows lying. XIII In simple faith he may believe That earth's diurnal way Doth, like its blessed Maker, pause Upon this hallowed day. XIV And should he ask, the happy man! If Heaven be aught like this:— 'Tis Heaven within him, breeding there The love of quiet bliss. XV Oh leave the man, my fretful friend! To follow nature's ways, Nor breathe to him that Christian feasts Are no true holydays. XVI Is Earth to be as nothing here, When we are sons of Earth? May not the body and the heart Share in the spirit's mirth? XVII When thou hast cut each earthly hold Whereto his soul may cling, Will the poor creature left behind Be more a heavenly thing? XVIII Heaven fades away before our eyes, Heaven fades within our heart, Because in thought our Heaven and Earth Are cast too far apart. CXXXII.THE EARTH'S HEART. TO MY NIECE. I There is a pulse in flowing streams, A calmly throbbing motion, A heart in the cold mountain springs As true as that of ocean. II Sit by yon bay where Rothay comes With merry sparkling fall To rest within the glossy pool Beneath the fern-fringed wall; III And see how like a real tide, Encroaching and retreating, Upon the polished gravel bed The uneven stream is beating. IV As if, although 'twas flowing down, Straight on it could not flow, But it must stay to breathe in pools, Like some poor hunted roe. V And at the river-head the lake From its blue hollows ever, A weary, tremulous, panting thing, Is sighing forth the river. VI And thus the breath of the huge hills, Among wet mosses sobbing, Works alway through the upland springs With momentary throbbing. VII And on the drear autumnal days, When o'er the naked heath The wind is riding, still it hath A palpitating breath. VIII And in the woods the evening air A breathing spirit dwells, Still cooing like a turtle dove, A shy voice in the dells. IX Those dazzling things, the waterfalls, That leap with such a cry In leafy clefts, sink down at times Into a woodland sigh. X Like one whose heart is in his mouth, Swift echo on the heath Speeds onward, shedding broken words, A runner out of breath. XI I speak not of the heaving sea, But of the solemn earth; I would thou should'st believe there is A heart in all her mirth. XII The dashing rivers are her joy, The pinewood plaint her sadness, The clamorous tempest is her rage, The earthquake is her madness. XIII The past is in her,—the long past, With all its light and gloom, What wonder then there should be throes In such a living tomb? XIV Her heart grows larger, as each day Sinks to it with a stir; It makes me grave to think of all That hath gone into her: XV Proud-minded kings and rebel mobs, And, by the will of fate, Enough to make another earth Of love unfortunate. XVI Then, when thou walkest on the hills, Or in the woods apart, Remember that the earth hath got Almost a human heart. XVII The joy and grief of centuries Have so much dark and bright, That they constrain earth's pulse to beat Alternate day and night. XVIII Sweet Alice! when thy blameless past Shall enter this old earth, The world will find, and know not why, More calmness in her mirth. CXXXIII.MY WORLD. I am a chronicler of little things,— Comings and goings, children's words and ways, Chance guests, new hosts, and single happy days, And household legends. These have been the springs Of much of my best knowledge: I have striven To make my narrow homely world a glass, Where shapes and shadows, like a breath, might pass, Dimly reflecting motions out of Heaven. And sometimes things have so encountered things As to eclipse each other,—moving rings Which meet and intersect, chilling all mirth When they awhile the wondering household draw Beneath the shadow of some mighty law, In circle calm revolving round the earth. CXXXIV.ON A CHILD, WHO SUFFERED FROM FITS. No sooner cast upon the sounding beach From the dim sea where unborn spirits are, But, with malignest influence touched, the fair And glorious soul was drawn beyond our reach. We search for thy great spirit, Brother, where In the dull distant caverns of thy being The stricken thing may haply now be fleeing Before some awful sights, or in some snare Caught trembling, all unconscious we are nigh. But sight and sound shall couch thy spirit's eye: In thy wild mirth and outbursts of rude glee We shall behold thee daily set aside The withs the Dark One hath around thee tied, Bidding some portion of thyself go free. CXXXV.THE DOG. Grief for her absent master in her wrought, So I in pity took her out with me, Though I would fain have walked alone, to be Less hindered in the current of my thought: And then I threw her sticks for which she ran;— Who would not cheer a sorrow when he can? After some miles we met at twilight pale A neighbor of her master's passing by, And, with blythe demonstration in her eye, She turned and followed him along the vale. So I walked on, companioned by the moon, Well pleased that even a casual form or feature Of the old times was dearer to the creature Than the new friend of one bright afternoon. CXXXVI.THE SNOWY MOUNTAIN. A DOMESTIC POEM. A student out of doors, where mountain winds, With voices deepened by the raving brooks, Inspire into the lassitude of thought Somewhat of vernal buoyancy, I went To a calm haunt, while overhead sweet spring An airy cloister diligently roofed. I was in my peculiar, sheltered walk Among the beeches and the laurels: there, In meditation utterly immured, Chewing the luscious prunings of sweet bay, I troubled my poor self with Charlemagne, Otho, Conrad the Salic, and the tribe Of great bad men, who made and shaped the earth We live upon to-day. Why should a heart, Begirt with trees and streams and cawing rooks, And with a tent of bluest sky above, Amid the jocund images that grow Of the blythe present, fret about the past, Stirring the silent bones of emperors, And dusty banners of old paladins? Sometimes,—a brighter vision far, and yet A riddle still more difficult to read, Divine things always look so undivine,— I mused the fortunes of enchanted Rome, Where Christ, with a tiara on His brow, Sits, and delays the hour of Anti-Christ,— City, whose supernatural ways ill mate The style of modern life, yet suit so well All change, all progress, all vicissitude, Too broad, too nearly infinite, to let The grandest present cover its extent, Or equal its intense vitality,— Unboastful city, not defending self, And answering questions only with a look, Healing the world of its successive ills, Queening it o'er the wildest times, with grace Which conquers those that conquer her, and who, While centuries are breaking at her feet Tame as tired waves that scarcely kiss the strand, Spite of her crumbling walls and pagan wrecks, Sits musing mid her tombs, and quietly, Scarce looking up when danger's hour comes near, Braves the world's fury, and with passive calm Disarms the ages by her right to live. Bewildered more and more, I walked and walked, And still light would not rise, thought would not come, Clear, steady thought; the German Empire lay A nightmare on my mind; when with rude shock From out a bush my little favourite boy By stealth leaped on me, clinging to my coat, And uttering a most victorious cry. His face was flushed, his bonnet laid aside, His long brown hair disordered by his play, And in his eyes there glimmered the sly light Of merriment, half weary of itself, Flagging and spent with an excess of joy. Mornings are long to children: he was tired With running, and as much with resting too, Among the daisies and the buttercups That were enamelling the April field. These were the cares which fretted him, as great, I doubt not, and substantial as the wealth, The power, the fame, the barren scholarship, Wherein we grown-up children spend our strength. It may be that in nature's honest eye A knot of wild-flowers are of truer worth Than the old German State, or any dream From which the world has wakened: for the flower Is a pure growth of heavenly love, a thing Unblamed by Him who made it. He was tired, And bitterly complained of the strange heat So early in the year: the April sun Among our lofty hills is all unused To such reproach; he should have rather blamed The heat of his own restless happiness. Yet wherefore were the things without us made, (So reason childish hearts, or rather act As if they reasoned so) except to bear The blame most due to that which is within? “There is no heat, my little boy,” said I; “Thy head is reeling with the open air, “And breathing grass, and the new glossy leaves, “And all the sunny aspect of the hills: “The power of spring hath made thee drunk, my child, “With its brisk spirit poured into thy veins, “After long months of cold within the house “Among thy playthings, wearisome through use: “But sunshine is an unabated joy “Which neither use nor frequency make dull.” So spake I, rambling in a thoughtful strain Which the child understood not, but once more Cried out against fair April for its heat. “Come then with me,” said I, “I told thee once “That there was nothing nature could not do, “Ay, nothing nature would not do, for those “Who love her as they ought,—that she would bring “New playthings and old sunshine every day. “Now let us speak to the maternal earth; “She ever answers me when I do speak.” I took him by the hand, and he looked up Most reverently into my face, as though I were a man of marvels, such as he Had seen last Michaelmas at our great fair. A gentle juggler, I conveyed the child, From the low sheltered walk wherein we were, Unto a bare and lofty terrace, whence We looked into the desolate recess Of a huge mountain clothed in shining snow. The air was warm and tranquil; not a breath Stirred in the seven tall larches, a sweet ring Which visibly was making all the haste It could, to robe itself in blythsome green. The boughs were pendulous and still; and there I placed the boy in front of the vast cove And giant ribs of snow, and bade him look Boldly into the mountain's snowy face, And ask it for a wind, a good cold wind To blow into his eyes. With timid voice,— As of a child, half pleased and half afraid, Who yields himself upon a Christmas night To some new trick, when all the rest stand back,— He asked the snowy mountain for a wind. Scarce had the words escaped his trembling lips, When, with a motion on the distant woods, A cold fresh breeze along the terrace swept, And died away, a marvellous response To his shy prayer. How quick his heart did beat, While with surprise and awe he looked again Less boldly in the mountain's snowy face! This time he did not ask it for a wind. 'Twas a sweet sight to see the little boy Stand there, and gaze into the mountain's face And on the sheets of silent, sparkling snow, With eyes brimful of wonder and delight, And with bewildered meanings running over. Now when his patience—'twas a scanty stock— Had wellnigh failed, there came another breeze, Colder and ruder than the first, at which He laughed outright into the mountain's face With pure delight, as though it sent the breeze For his sole sport; and I might safely say The snowy mountain laughed at him again; For it sent out a mighty, boisterous wind Which made the larch-trees loudly creak, and blew Young Richard's tartan bonnet down the hill. Away in mad pursuit, both man and boy Followed the truant cap, which we reclaimed With laughter ere it reached the dangerous stream. “Thou wilt remember now,” said I, “the power “Of the old earth, and that she hath a heart, “A mother's heart, among her lonely hills. “Thou wilt remember too and love this snow, “Whose beautiful white fields are melting fast; “And this kind-hearted mountain thou wilt love. “Be kind to it thyself in all thy thoughts; “And when the evil summer of these vales “Arrives, and that high summit brings the clouds “To weep a very plague of drizzling rain “All through the holydays, remember still “This mountain is the mother of cold winds; “And be not petulant, but love it well “For this day's boon:” then with a mimic sign Of wrath, I added, “and forget not too “That poets are lone walkers and strange men, “Not to be leaped on in their chosen paths, “Or scared by shouts from groves of arbutus.” Once more in my peculiar, sheltered walk, My thoughts imbrued in blood and battlefields, And with my fancy chastened and kept down By the great shade of royal Charlemagne, I see the boy at play upon the lawn, But with the great, white mountain in his heart, Which loads him with a new solemnity,— An altered being, even in his play, More happy, yet less vocal in his mirth. From this day forth the mountain and the snow From common sights are lifted in his mind Unto the rank of causes, solemn things To be by him more honored than before. It is a just beginning: all our lives This is the wisdom which we have to learn— To see our earthly shadows taken up And by the Cross commuted into signs Or substances,—and with strong faith to feel Our own immortal being so transfused Into the out-lying world, that common forms Are canonized, and circled with a light, Like the pale rings around the autumnal moon. The man to whom our common daily things By meek devotion and a simple eye Have grown to reverend solemnities,— What lacketh he of his full growth in Christ? CXXXVII.TO LITTLE ALICE. I If thou couldst be a bird, what bird wouldst thou be? A frolicsome gull on the billowy sea, Screaming and wailing when stormy winds rave, Or anchored, white thing! on the merry green wave? II Or an eagle aloft in the blue ether dwelling, Free of the coves of the hoary Helvellyn, Who is up in the sunshine when we are in shower, And could reach our loved ocean in less than an hour? III Or a heron that haunts the Wallachian edge Of the barbarous Danube mid forests of sedge, And hears the rude waters through dreary swamps flowing, And the cry of the wild swans, and buffalos lowing? IV Or a stork on a mosque's broken pillar in peace By some famous old stream in the bright land of Greece, A sweet-mannered householder! waiving his state Now and then in some kind little toil for his mate? V Or a murmuring dove at Stamboul, buried deep In the long cypress woods where the infidels sleep, Whose leaf-muffled voice is the soul of the seas, That hath passed from the Bosphorus into the trees? VI Or a heath-bird that lies on the Cheviot moor, Where the wet shining earth is as bare as a floor, Who mutters glad sounds though his joys are but few,— Yellow moon, windy sunshine, and skies of cold blue? VII Or if thy man's heart worketh in thee at all, Perchance thou would'st dwell by some bold baron's hall, A black glossy rook working early and late, Like a labouring man on the baron's estate? VIII Or a linnet who builds in the close hawthorn bough, Where her small frightened eyes may be seen looking through; Who heeds not, fond mother! the oxlips that shine On the hedge-bank beneath, or the glazed celandine. IX Or a swallow that flieth the sunny world over The true home of spring and spring-flowers to discover; Who, go where he will, takes away on his wings Good words from mankind for the bright thoughts he brings? X But what! can these pictures of strange wingèd mirth Make the child to forget that she walks on the earth? Dost thou feel at thy sides as though wings were to start From some place where they lie folded up in thy heart? XI Then love the green things in thy first simple youth, And the beasts, birds, and fishes with heart and in truth, And fancy shall pay thee thy love back in skill;— Thou shalt be all the birds of the air at thy will! CXXXVIII.THE ASCENT OF HELVELLYN. APRIL 28, 1842. HAVING ASCENDED PARNASSUS THE SAME DAY IN THE PRECEDING YEAR. I At morn we wended forth right merrily, With hearts as high as though we had been bent On great emprise and martial tournament: The wind blew softly through the azure sky, And in the dome the mountains stood upright, Vested from head to foot in softest light, Hung round them, a transparent drapery. II The budding branches of the oakwood bowers With honeysuckle in full leaf were tangled; The western slopes with primroses were spangled, And cuckoo-plant and dusky violet-flowers; And here and there the fragrant woodland floor With white anemones was powdered o'er, Like the last melting fringes of snow-showers. III How rich the carpet of yon fir-tree dome! The moss just tinged afresh in juicy dyes, The moneywort with countless golden eyes, The dark green daffodil now shorn of bloom, The woodroffe with its fragrant withered leaves, While here and there an early orchis grieves To flower and fade before its kinsfolk come. IV And to the eye betrayed by his deep tongue, Within his watch-tower of old fir there sate The pensive heron in baronial state, And thrushes from their holly coverts sung; All things were happy,—from the radiant skies Down to the little breeze-fanned butterflies, Which pendent from the rocking may-flowers swung. V Along the moorland steeps the heated air To lines of silky softness did subdue The harsh, rough walls, and bade the purple hue Of the bright mere a crape of mist to wear. The young lambs gleamed upon the island mead; And hyacinths had just begun to lead Their blue processions o'er the coppice there. VI Then past the lately-felled larch wood we rode, Not thankless for the odor which it gave; We saw the newly plumed birch branches wave, Where Greenhead brook in its rough channel flowed; Onward we mounted from the quiet vale, Till through its verdant gap the smooth Dunmail One distant head of father Skiddaw showed. VII The mountain pass with streaks of herbage green And loose blue stones alternately was faced, Like amethyst with emerald interlaced On either side, and the blue sky between. The haze-fire played on Dunmail's shapeless tomb, As though 'twere breathed from out the uncouth gloom Where that old king nine hundred years hath been. VIII O I am garrulous perforce to tell The birds, the wildflowers, and the pageantries Of light and shade, the foliage and the breeze, Which there upon that joyous day befell; Lest aught omitting, I should haply miss Some cheerful adjunct to that mood of bliss Whereon hereafter we should love to dwell. IX Then from the Raise we turned to look once more On Grasmere vale, so sweetly interspersed With fields and woodlands, and the blue lake nursed By its two streams, and fair hills bending o'er; Ruling the vale, was heard the cuckoo's cry Ubiquitous, like law's dread majesty, Unseen, but audible from shore to shore. X The poets vaunt autumnal hues too much; There is a season, a brief twenty days, Intercalated between summer's rays And the green flush of spring, whose tints are such, As, for their depth and fair variety, Richest autumnal coloring all outvie In shading delicate and grace of touch. XI The gilded oak, the willow's pale sea-green, The sable pine with brilliant larches blending, And the fair birch its glossy plumage lending To mediate the light and dark between,— The yellow beech, the manly sycamore, And clouds of cherry blossom floating o'er— May well outdo sad autumn's broidered scene. XII And all is joy or hope in earth and sky; 'Tis not like autumn's pensive power that lies In beautiful decay, which we so prize Because it is a glory passing by;— But a sweet sense that flowers are underfoot, And that long evenings now are taking root, And summer days foreshadowed pleasantly. XIII But now, the Cumbrian border gained at last, At Wythburn's larch-girt Shrine and lonely dwelling We stood beneath the steeps of great Helvellyn. One year this very morning we had passed The defiles of Parnassus, and had seen The crags which over voiceless Delphi lean, And on rich Crissa's plain their shadow cast. XIV And the same day had now been dignified, In humorous caprice and pleasant mood, To explore Helvellyn's pastoral solitude, And the huge coves upon its eastern side: And never day could dawn more graciously; There was no cloud in all the dappled sky, Which did not clear of every summit ride. XV Like virtue, old Helvellyn must be won By the first hard ascent o'er moorland grass Intolerably smooth, as polished glass, Save the moss-swollen lines where streamlets run, Tinkling like hidden bells; and o'er the steep The shrunken waterfalls in silence creep, Braiding their crystal beadshowers in the sun. XVI And, as we clung like goats to the steep grass, How strangely sight and memory did strike Against each other! Oh how all unlike To the Greek hill our own Helvellyn was! And, ere we did the first green platform reach, In broken words each had reminded each Of noble features in the Phocian Pass. XVII Oh I could weep for pity when I hear, Soft as far echoes, those old names of Greece, Spots I have seen in utter joyless peace, Like sanctuaries, beautiful but drear! And who will blame though Delphi now supplants With vivid presence these domestic haunts, As though embayed in its rough ledges here? XVIII Full in the face of sunset Ktypa stood, When from the sheepflocks on the Theban plain I first beheld the great Parnassian chain, Nine layers of folded mountain crag, which glowed Distinctly pencilled out by purple mist, Till, by the shooting flames of sunset kissed, They melted off into the golden flood. XIX Calm was the morning when our upward way From bowl to bowl of shrubby moorland rose, Where nothing but smooth-stemmed lentiscus grows; The distances were soft and clear; no ray Of garish sunbeam to those heights did come, Curtained within a pleasant, pensive gloom Of daylight, tinged, but not obscured, with gray. XX Fearful, Parnassus! are thy clefts, which lean With their deep yellow rocks across the dell, Terrace on terrace piled, and citadel With ever-tumbling towers, o'ertopped with green, With belts of jutting pine-wood Pinus maritima. darkly seamed In airy, hanging slopes, as I have dreamed The Babylonian gardens to have been. XXI There is Arracova with sounding shores, Perched mid the torrent-springs and eagles'-nests: There, on her steep recumbent, Delphi rests Her patient ear on old earth's steaming pores; There in a cool rock-shaded trough hard by The silent tripod, gifted Castaly Her silver water frugally outpours. XXII How beautiful the moon rose on the shore And olive-tops of Salona! The light In trickling falls stole down from every height, Until the pinewood belts were silvered o'er; And tremulous pulses of white splendor crept To glens which still in purple darkness slept, Teasing the eye their soft gloom to explore. XXIII I rose and sunk upon the gentle sea, And from Herodotus I strove to spell By the clear moon some Delphic oracle In quaint hexameters, while memory Aided the dubious light: I was alone, And all entranced; for truth, which had outgrown My dream, still more a dream appeared to be. XXIV How glorious was the night, the twofold power Of hills and starry sea, when I did float At anchor there, while dark above my boat In the bright air did true Parnassus tower! And, as the curlew's solitary wail Was faintly answered from some inland vale, I could have wept for joy of that sweet hour. XXV As in the night all outward noises creep Into our dreams, so the sad curlew's cry On the Greek bay Helvellyn did supply Unto my wakeful trance; a lonely sheep Sent forth a mournful bleating to recall Me from the dream which did in gentle thrall The very outposts of my senses keep. XXVI To hear high up it is a solemn sound, And, rising from a sunken hollow nigh, It seems far off, a voice in the blue sky Or earthborn plaint breathed from the moorland ground, A woful elegy, which hourly fills The pastoral waste with melancholy thrills, And echoes by the lone tarn's desert bound. XXVII The platform gained, we watched one fair cloud sail For some Atlantic haven; the gay fir Looked through the mist below like gossamer, A thin green network stretched across the vale. The wheat-ears ran or glided through the grass And o'er the stones; they might for serpents pass, Parting the crisp white stalks with rustling tail. XXVIII One more ascent, and we had gained with slow And weary step the mountain's eastern edge, Where, hanging o'er the sheer and dizzy ledge, There stood a sparkling parapet of snow, Breeding a wild desire to lean thereon, Although we shivered at the thought alone, And turned from that abyss which yawned below. XXIX Then in light mood the surface did we break, The virgin surface of the giant drift, And to our mouths the tempting crystals lift, Yet dared we not our burning thirst to slake; But, standing on the slope of greensward nigh With the white battlement in front breast-high, We delved our hands therein for coolness' sake. XXX Then onward o'er a shingly, sea-like beach Of dreary stones with scarce a lichen veined, Or blotched with golden spots, or weather-stained, Did we the high-crowned promontory reach, And hoary pile and beacon-staff all rent And peeled and white, which wintry storms have sent Wild winds and eddies of strong rain to bleach. XXXI There to the north the silver Solway shone, And Criffel, by the hazy atmosphere Lifted from off the earth, did then appear A nodding island or a cloud-built throne. And there, a spot half fancied and half seen, Was sunny Carlisle; and by hillside green Lay Penrith with its beacon of red stone. XXXII Southward through pale blue steam the eye might glance Along the Yorkshire fells, and o'er the rest, My native hill, dear Ingleboro's crest, Rose shapely, like a cap of maintenance. The classic Duddon, Leven, and clear Kent A trident of fair estuaries sent, Which did among the mountain roots advance. XXXIII Westward, a region of tumultuous hills, With here and there a tongue of azure lake And ridge of fir, upon the eye did break. But chiefest wonder are the tarns and rills And giant coves, where great Helvellyn broods Upon his own majestic solitudes, Which even now the sunlight barely fills. XXXIV There Striding Edge with Swirrel meets to keep The Red Tarn still when tempests rage above: There Catsty-Cam doth watch o'er Keppel Cove And the chill pool that lurks beneath the steep. Far to the right St. Sunday's quiet shade Stoops o'er the dell, where Grisedale Tarn is laid Beneath that solemn crag in waveless sleep. XXXV The golden cliffs which from Parnassus lean With uncouth rivets of the roots of trees, And silent-waving pinewood terraces, And burnished zones of hanging evergreen,— Haunts of the antique muses though they are, May not for dread solemnity compare, Or savage wonders, with this native scene. XXXVI Awful in moonlight shades, more awful far When the winds wake, are those majestic coves, Or when the thunder feeds his muttering droves Of swart clouds on the raven-haunted scar; And in the bright tranquillity of noon Most awful; lovely only in the boon Of soft apparel wrought by twilight air. XXXVII Shall Brownrigg Well be left without a song, Which near the summit, mid the wintry snows In a clear vein of liquid crystal flows, And through the pastoral months in gushes strong Gleams in the eye of sunset, and from far Holds up a mirror to the evening star, While round its mouth the thirsty sheepflocks throng? XXXVIII And now, with loitering step and minds unbent Through hope fulfilled, we reached the vale once more; And, wending slowly along Rydal shore, Watched the dusk splendor which from Langdale went, And on the hills dethroned the afternoon; And home was gained ere yet the yellow moon From over Wansfell her first greeting sent. XXXIX Thus flowed the day, a current o'er the mind; Yet happiness however plain or short, Is alway meekly forward to consort With virtuous mood and purpose, and unbind Selfish desires, making the genial calms Of pleasure not abused a liberal alms Of loving thoughts unto all human-kind. CXXXIX.THE POET'S WORKSHOP. I The litter of a student's room Bewilders those who do not know it; But it is neatness when compared With the dim workshop of a poet. II O if you could but enter there, Where foreign foot may not intrude, Of puzzling sights and puzzling sounds 'Twould seem a clamorous solitude. III The murmuring hum of line, half line, Choice turn of words and happy ending, As from a thousand spinning wheels Is there continually ascending. IV There sight and sound fresh forms and tools At windows ever open fling, Which that strange Man, the Artisan, Receives with boorish welcoming. V And heaps of words and heaps of thoughts, In rows or circles gathered, wait, And seem but sorry furniture Except to the initiate. VI The words in little parcels are, By nature prone to nuptial ties, With some apart, like bachelors At hand to fill chance vacancies. VII And here and there are idioms cast To which no filing polish gives, And chief in our hoarse tongue we note Battered and bruised infinitives. VIII There are articulate-speaking thoughts, Gregarious things, in lowing herds,— Quick guesses that were never seen Without their flowing veil of words. IX These are the things of longest life, Struck off in some high hour of mirth: We know not whether thoughts or words Came first and foremost to the birth. X And feelings inarticulate Stir every heap of words asunder, Shifting and shaking all the tools, As though blind worms were crawling under. XI Strange shop it is with littered floor! Rejected types are strewn all o'er it, Which one day tumble into rhyme, As though they had been destined for it. XII And pliant supple shapes there are, Which neath the artist's pressure bend, Beginning as he wills they should, But coming to a different end. XIII Look from the window! Canst thou tell The land, the latitude, the weather, With sun and moon, and night and noon, So oddly kneaded all together? XIV And dost thou ask if habit holds This shop within her sphere and order? I say, 'tis built on her domains, But at the very outmost border. XV From wild turmoil and caitiff toil Seek not, Philanthropist! to win it; For that strange Man, the Artisan, Is happy, oh how happy! in it. CXL.I HAVE WILD MOODS. I have wild moods (who hath not?) when I long For midnight tempests, and the boisterous song And jocund rudeness of the mighty wind; And when I have a weight upon my mind To be dispersed by warring element,— A warp within my soul, to be unbent At once by the tremendous sympathy Of rocking woods, rent earth, and reeling sea,— Moods when the Whence and What and Whither flash Like a bright arrow o'er my soul, and dash All meek, good things from their calm pedestals, Lighting within my spirits' ample halls A ruinous conflagration, which destroys In one dread hour the store of peaceful joys Won from religious ties or hallowed fears, Or fruit mayhap of consecrated tears, Tears shed o'er sin, or smiles by Angels brought In holy churches from a ritual caught. Moods are they when I bid my soul come bare From her dim place, that I may gaze at her, And praise or blame her make; there is in me At times a hot and fierce desire to see And realize my immortality:— When it would be relief to me to heave A huge unnatural weight of rock, and leave The mass on some hill-top, for aye to prove That there is nought man's spirit may not move:— When I should love to scatter a thick night Over all lands and oceans, so to blight The joys of earth, and see all men afraid, While my one gazing soul stood undismayed. These are the spirit-wasting moods, yea, these The fever, restlessness, and weak disease Of one who prays too seldom: at dead night Doth the strange spirit come with unstayed might, Until our open souls grow large and swell With the influx of dark, invisible And dire possession, that doth quickly drench Our powers in sin, and fain our souls would wrench From the good Cross, which like a floating mast Unto the shipwrecked, is our first and last True hope:—and our hands bleed in holding fast. CXLI.AN EPISTLE TO A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT. “Why anchorest thou in those blue lakes for ever, Dear Student of the moorland and the river?”— My old Companion! we have been apart And have lost count of one another's heart. A various Past, an unknown region lies Between the sweet tract of our memories And the too-stirring Present. I have been A wanderer now through many a foreign scene, Not without inward change; and I have dwelt Much in my lonely spirit, till I felt I was a person to myself unknown; And this hath been one fruit of being alone. And I have changed each image of my life; And all the objects of my mortal strife I have arrayed in other shapes and places, Encompassing myself with different faces, To see in what relationship I stood To the new world around me: both my good And ill have been most intricately shifted, And my whole life insensibly uplifted Unto a different end: my fear and hope Have other holdfasts and another scope: And love is unto me a different birth From what it was in our old boyish mirth, And hath a deeper root in this kind earth. I have a more abounding joy, a will Less mutable, and faculties more still. There were green withs about my spirit bound, But they are lying faded on the ground. Now I can walk abroad in the sweet calm Of resignation, breathing holy balm Like evening air around me: I am haunted By a new boldness, solemn and undaunted, The very treasure I have always wanted; And, with whatever friends or strangers thrown, The secret of that boldness is my own, An underground delight, a murmuring Among dry leaves and grass, as from a spring. The thing for which I pined, the early lost, The vainly sought on boyhood's sunny coast, The thing that left me, like an uncaged dove, I have laid hands on: and it is not love. I mourn not, as thou mournest, o'er the fate Of our own summer year of Thirty Eight. It came and went within us, like a breeze, Chiming among our thoughts as in the trees. It stirred us, as a breeze may stir the lake, And thou art gazing yet on its bright wake. A glory is no glory, if it last; Thou art entranced, young dreamer! in the past. None dream so wildly or so much, as those Whose early manhood rank or duty throws Into the fret of action, action spoken, Where energy is prematurely broken Into such fragments and small sums of power As may be drawn for by the present hour. These are the dreamers, whom the little things Of this life deafen with their murmurings, Who are constrained to let the Present cast A shadow o'er the Future and the Past, Or let the Present's feverish pressure dry Those two great fountains of nobility. There is a time in life when it is well That our true selves should be invisible, When we should stand in patient calm apart, And action should lie still within our heart, Like unripe ore, collecting every hour From self-restraint new increments of power. There is a time in life when we should shroud Our inner selves with somewhat of a cloud, When to bystanders we should strive to seem Less than we are, and to appear to dream When we are toiling earnestly and much: For so may we ward off all outward touch And meddling hindrance, which might mar and spoil The growing fabric of our hidden toil. And therefore am I anchored in blue lakes, And screened, like some shy bird, by copsewood brakes, Lest things drift uppermost and be revealed, Which I would have in my dim self concealed. For I have had, like many another man, A life with two beginnings; and I ran Unto an end in my first forward youth, Which had the vesture and the face of truth; But it was not the measure of my being, And therefore am I with wise caution fleeing To lurk awhile and tarry for more age In an obscure and quiet anchorage. In that old rambling year of Thirty Eight Thou knewest me encircled with a state And retinue of vision, feeling, thought, Joy, fear, and hot conception, all inwrought. That pageant is worn out: from that old ring I have stepped forth, and am encompassing Myself afresh, and with long-pondered moves Am bringing up new joys, new fears, new loves. Thou askest how and whence hath come the change? In what new fields my thought and fancy range? I can but tell thee of some outward shapes; Thou canst but hear the murmur which escapes Amid the silence: it will show where lies The growing quarrel in our sympathies. Ah for the faded year of Thirty Eight! How little recked I then of this strange fate Which lay in ambush at the very door Of headlong youth, the spoiler of its store, Like a new wisdom in a heart grown old, A mountain stone amid the shy flock rolled.— Enough; and dost thou ask where now I range, Through what transfiguring of inward change? To thee that Thirty Eight still sparkles near, While to thy friend it is a faded year— Faded in all save truest love for thee, And that high-souled young priest beyond the sea, And that dear bard, whose life is like a river, Singing and sighing on its road for ever. Time was when from within myself I drew My powers and thoughts and instincts: all I knew Was but the self-sprung harvest of my heart, And the whole outward world was cast apart. I was a worldless man, a thing detached, A wandering cloud, a being all unmatched With outward destiny; but now my power Is from the world imported every hour. The pains I suffer, and the tears I see, Men's passions chance-encountered, children's glee, And moral contradictions, and green leaves, And skies, and streams,—from these my spirit weaves Her web, and every day that passes by Doth add some little to the tapestry: For moral wisdom is a growing thing, Whene'er it rises from an outward spring. Time was when with a young man's pride I dreamed Quaintness was power; and when to differ seemed Greater than to agree, and I esteemed All individual marks, which stand apart, Above the beatings of my common heart, The heart I share with others: now I cherish All commonplace designs as things which nourish A fellow-feeling with my kindred; now To rise and sink, to range from high to low, To think as all men think in woe or mirth, Seems unto me the greatest gift on earth. Thus self hath daily less significance; And, like one waking from a pleasant trance, I love the pensive glow of earth far more Than the bright lights upon that dream-land shore. Our boyhood was a noble savage state, Whence we were not reclaimed in Thirty Eight. But now the heart's meek household growths are ours, And we must shade ourselves in their green bowers, With holiest care the shoots to prune or train, With smiles for sunshine, blameless tears for rain. I am not idle, though at anchor staying To learn self-mastery, a wise delaying. Had it been good, or had a heart of truth, I would sue back to me my banished youth. In calmly bending waters now I ride With manhood flowing round me like a tide: And, whether winds be foul or fair skies blue, I shall heave anchor when the ship is due, And come within thy sight to seek a part In the world's fretful glory, where thou art— A man in place with boyhood at thy heart. To thee, still in the lap of our old dream, This uncouth teaching for a while must seem A cold philosophy, a barren song; But it will not seem so unto thee long. Thou too wilt one day learn—it is not cold To speak of boyhood as a thing grown old. CXLII.THE FUTURE. TO MY BROTHER EDWARD. I I have wishes, I have dreams, And some vagrant hope which seems Like a most uncertain star, Still a joy, a joy from far: Yet the Future is to me Bright and barren as the sea, Bare of sorrow, bare of glee. When the present hour is weary Old times are my sanctuary. II In my heart are many springs, All with cheerful murmurings; But their sweetness lures my mind Oft its armor to unbind: Then the Past my succor is, A restraint on present bliss, And an impulse when remiss, A calm precinct, a grave rule, Where I am all day at school. III I have such a power of love, And such crowds of objects move My affections every day, That the present glides away: And I have too quick an eye Heavenly gestures to descry, Till in mute repose they lie, With time's shadow on them cast, In the bosom of the Past. IV There must surely be a cause Why, reversing common laws, Heaven by no foreboding sorrow Drives my thoughts upon the morrow, And that simple childish hours Should be still the only bowers, Where repentance gathers flowers, Whose strong scent of purer years Kindles awe and wakens tears. V I have striven in restless hours To invade the future's bowers, And with fancy's help to riot In the exquisite unquiet Of a self-disturbance, where All is shadowy as air; But it left my spirit bare, And some fault was sure to come To my wild heart as a home. VI Farewell, Future! thou must be Still a pathless tract to me, A bar which I may overleap Only in the spells of sleep. Heaven be praised! thou canst not tease Me from my contented ease, Nor taint me with the weak disease Of neglecting in my youth Simple thought and sober truth. VII I shall reach thee at the last When commuted to the Past, And my pleasure will be double For the self-restraint and trouble Of averting thus my eyes From thy pomps and mysteries, While I watch the Present rise From one conquest to another, Virtue still being virtue's brother. VIII Yet I doubt not thou art giving Light in which I now am living, As the moon, although unseen, Somehow scatters stealthy sheen. In the Past I often see Things which cannot rightly be The Past's, but must belong to thee, Wandering Future! strangely cast Deep into the prescient Past. CXLIII.TO A FRIEND IN PUBLIC LIFE. I What seest thou Of bush and bough, Green field or moorland border, Encompassed round, By sight and sound, The order of disorder? II With what fit state Can poor Spring wait On thee in London living? What moral light Are mornings bright To thy tired conscience giving? III What impulses Of skies and trees Can lonely fancy merit, Unless perchance Past springs may dance Along thy thrilling spirit? IV May every hour An April shower Thy thirsty heart be haunting, Thus filling up From its cold cup The joys which thou art wanting! V I would not be This day with thee, For all I love thee dearly; I would not miss This vernal bliss Which hath begun so early. VI Yet in my joy Is this alloy, It is almost a sorrow, No budding brake Thy soul can make Impatient for the morrow. VII Through good and ill With earnest will Thou toil'st for peer and peasant, And yet I would One little bud Might wean thee from the present,— VIII That thou couldst run In morning sun To see the rose-leaves peeping; For they would tell How calm and well Earth works while men are sleeping. IX For busy walk And toil and talk Are not life's only measure; But man, like earth, Hath quiet mirth, Which is a better treasure. X I am cast down Lest that huge town, Wild streets and wilder faces, With clamorous state Obliterate The thought of vernal places. XI For safety's sake To keep awake The spirit of the season, Say once an hour— ‘A lowly Flower Is wiser than proud Reason.’ XII With all the stir, Dear Prisoner! Of wealth and rank about thee, 'Twill make thee smile To think awhile Of the green world without thee. CXLIV.ENNERDALE. I thought of Ennerdale as of a thing Upon the confines of my memory. There was a hazy gleam as o'er a sheet Of sunny water cast, and mountain side, And much ploughed land, and cleanly cottages, A bubbling brook, the emptying of the lake, An indistinct remembrance of being pleased That there were hedgerows there instead of walls, That it was noon, and that I swam for long In the warm lake, and dressed upon a rock:— And this is all of verdant Ennerdale Which I can now recover from my mind; The current of bright years hath washed it out. Yet do I find the memory of it still A thing which I can lean upon, a spot Of greenness and fresh water in my soul. And I do feel the very knowledge good That there is such a place as Ennerdale, A valley and a lake of such a kind, As though I did possess it all myself With daily eye and ear, because I know It is possessed by simple dalesmen there. And I have many Ennerdales, am rich In woods and fields the owners think are theirs. I can dispark the trim enclosures first, And, in the very wantonness of power, Forthwith enclose the black, unfettered heath. I pass along the road, and set my seal On lawns, rough banks, wet coverts of wild flowers, And I can pick out trees from forest lands, For beauty or uncouthness singular, As heriots; nay, the very brooks salute Their master as they leap, tinkling to him, Shrewd vassals! as their truest feudal lord, With music such as they have never paid Unto the self-called owner: when I walk By night among the moistened woods they send From every glen their dues of mossy smells, And fragrance of the withered things which lie Upon the woodland floor. I make a stir Among the fields and flowery clods, as though I would have something changed; I fold my arms, And look around, and draw my breath; I gaze Upon the fair estates and think how I Shall will them to my children in sweet songs. Early and late I'm out upon my lands, And with pleased consequence survey the growth Of my young trees, acquiring fresh each day, Although the owners know not that they are But tenants at my will. I have, in store, The title-deeds of many a distant wood And foreign chase. With feeling eye and ear I have been gifted, and in right of them, Like a great lord, I walk about the land, Claiming and dispossessing at my will,— The belted Earl of many Ennerdales! CXLV.A LETTER TO A FRIEND. Thou askest me, dear Friend! for what old cause These men thus hate thee.—Hatred hath no laws, But is a weak-willed thing, which in young days A look, a word, a random doubt can raise. Account not of it; it hath slender root; For bitter speech doth mostly overshoot In our warm youth a passion's real length, And words are unfair measures of the strength Of youthful things: there is too great a want Of love and kindly thoughts, for hate to haunt A young heart long. Account not of it then, Nor harshly blame the speeches of those men. Ah! never blame the hearts thou dost not know: Full are they doubtless of good thoughts, and flow O'er many round them with a power to bless, With sunny tempers, and meek gentleness, With quick forgiveness, and sweet conquests won O'er self and sin, and generous actions done. They have their ring of friends, and pensive ties, And put as much on welcomes and kind eyes As we can do. Why wilt thou treasure up Hard words like these, which do but taint the cup Of thine own happiness? Thou canst not spare One shred of peaceful feeling; life will mar That store too soon with its rude misery. I should have thought, dear Friend! that I loved thee But feebly and unwisely to suppose Thou shouldst permit thy spirit's deep repose To be thus jarred, because some men speak ill Of one with a proud heart and headstrong will, Most variable mien, and bitter tongue Which hath too often to like taunts been strung. If I must blame, then will I censure thee; For doubtless in the days when thou wert free From those restraints upon thy thought and speech, Which now, by prayer with prayer enchained, can reach Barely across the day, thou mayst have wrought Some evil, vented some ill-natured thought, Been cold when kindly manners were required, Distracted in thyself, sullen, or tired, Imperious or capricious, at the hour When, which is Angels' lot, thou hadst the power To sow a gentle thought, or do a deed Which, like a prayer, in thy behalf might plead. Some wrong hast thou done them or their near friends, Whose memory, like a teasing shade, attends The thought of thee within them. Ah! be slow To blame these censors! For how canst thou know True love is not the soil where this dislike, On jealous friendship grafted, now doth strike Quick root, I hope not lasting? Sure I am It is more likely far that honest blame Should rest on thee, than that a groundless hate On any human heart on earth should wait. Oh! surely there are none would rather slake Their thirsty souls at bitter wells, than take The sweet and ready waters of mild springs, Which lure us by their very murmurings. I must believe—fond faith perchance—true hate To be of young hearts excommunicate. “But if the judgments are untrue?” What then? They may not seem so unto other men Who know thee better: and I never heard Reported slander, but there was some word, Some stray expression, like a well-aimed dart, Which found a rightful home within my heart. If I deserved it not from him who spoke, I did from some one else; and it awoke Soft thoughts and kind regrets, such as belong In compensation unto those we wrong. If now unmerited, it was not so In younger days, or some few years ago; And it is well to have our sinful past Upon our notice somewhat roughly cast In bitter admonitions: Providence By these revenges would prolong the sense Of self-abasement, and the cleansing grief Which in young hearts is wont to be too brief. It is true health which Christian spirits win From out the abiding shade of early sin. But let this pass: an honest casuist His holy science must have sorely missed, Who would not from such things by subtle law Wise canons for ascetic living draw; And even to ourselves it is more fair To think ourselves in fault than that our neighbors are. Then be not thou afraid; a few short years, Deepening the shades of life with pensive fears, Have holiest power to soften and subdue The starting feature and the glaring hue, Which in our youth will struggle into view. Time, which can heal us and yet give no pain, Will right the tremulous balance once again, And rescue, overlaid by youth's excess Of speech and feeling, childhood's gentleness, Then mellowed by calm age. Oh! it is sweet, As through the thick of life we turn our feet To feel how harsh, unamiable ways Wear out within us by the lapse of days, Or drop like chains which have our spirits bound Close prisoners from the hearts which lie around. Then meek-eyed simpleness and common mirth Start, like the flowers in spring, o'er all the earth, And we confess the world is made so fair That nought, but self, can be beneath us there, That such good clings to all that round us move We fain must pity where we cannot love; There is no soil where scorn or cold dislike, Except in self, abiding root can strike. Then be not thou afraid: for I would see In these dislikes a peaceful guarantee Of gentleness hereafter, which may wait, Kindly retributive, on this strange hate. For, in the crossings of our various strife, And oddly intersecting paths of life, We may be brought in contact with a heart Which dealt hard measure to us once, and part Regretting that we should have been so much Of our short lives beyond each other's touch,— Winning kind thoughts which, whether told or not, It is a solid blessing to have got. And to the generous mind there is no love Which doth more calm and ready service move Than that, which through harsh judgments hath been long Withheld from those to whom we have done wrong. Tonight in my lone ramble through the dell, I saw the sun sink down behind the fell. When twilight barred him out with crimson shrouds, I saw a kneeling Angel in the clouds; It seemed the centre of the glory, whence, A spot almost too bright for aching sense, A deep effulgence travelled o'er the hills, Lighting the woods, and finding out the rills In their sequestered channels; on the breast Of one most rugged mountain did it rest. Ah me! dear Friend! I wish thou couldst have seen With what a light it flushed the vernal green, And how the huge, unsightly stones it wrought To forms of yielding softness, while it brought A power of transmutation to the line Which keen and jaggèd did but lately shine, Yet now lay gloriously inflamed on high, Like an aërial mist across the sky Or wavering haze. Such is the softness cast Upon the heart when youth's hot hour is past. For some years now not one ungentle thought Towards any of my kind hath in me wrought: Yet once more do I pray kind Heaven to give That in this beam I may for ever live, That I may have a sunset in my spirit To glorify and soften all things near it! CXLVI.THE EASTER VIOLETS. I I spoke by chance of modest flowers, And how, in all the banks and bowers Of vernal Bagley's greenwood ways, They ever added to my store Of festal joys, a charm the more To Christian holidays. II A kind heart, little known to me, Amid the various company That night this random mention heard. I spoke with truth, but never thought What welcome service would be wrought For me by that stray word. III Yet when we utter what we feel, The homeliest, simplest things will steal To many an ear and heart unknown; And most in song will quiet truth In right of its unfading youth Find out and win its own. IV The sun shone fair on Easter Eve, The day when festal fancies weave Bright threads into the Lenten gloom, When our free thoughts, Good Friday over, Doubtful 'twixt joy and penance, hover About the Garden Tomb. V My new-made friend that very day, His face with radiant humor gay A little sheaf of violets brought, Large blossoms singled out with care, And with long searching here and there At that chill season got. VI “I've looked the college garden through To find each one of freshest hue, That from its purple censer flings True fragrance to the old March breeze; You are a priest,” said he, “take these For Easter offerings.” VII He tendered them with smiling glance And playful grace, which might enhance The courteous tribute that he brought. It was a gentle act, and stirred My soul to think how simple word In simple heart had wrought. VIII A trivial act! Yet kindness stored In common vessels is a hoard, Which we more palpably discover. We fancy there is better measure Dealt out unto us when the treasure From lesser gifts runs over. IX The single drop of pearly dew Which falls from out the harebell blue, When on the breezy heath it quivers, The meek observant heart will move, As proof, more touching, of God's love Than the abounding rivers. X O sweet is kindliness unbought By service we ourselves have wrought, Or long-tried friendship's winning arts! O sweet is sympathy which springs From chance occasions, random things, And unexpected hearts! XI There are who on vast purpose bent With these stray joys are ill content, These angel-scattered shreds of bliss, The wild-flowers of the lavish earth, Her natural growth of blameless mirth;— Alas! how much they miss! XII The thoughts of kind acts long ago Will one day, like a fountain, flow; And, when old age upon us sets, We shall need memory then to cheer A flagging mood, or dry a tear, With such stray violets. XIII They say that gentle soul is now Beneath dire sorrow drooping low, O'ershadowed by a clouded mind. May Heaven to his meek heart restore The radiant spirit as of yore, And that rude spell unbind! CXLVII.THE LAST PALATINE. I How dark and dull is all the vaporous air, Loaded with sadness as though earth would grieve Whene'er the skirts of ancient grandeur leave A place they once enriched forlorn and bare! Man and the earth in mutual bonds have dwelt So long together, that it were not strange Old lights eclipsed and barren-hearted change, Should be by sentient nature deeply felt. II And with the motions of her outward shows, Prophetic leadings, I would almost say, Guiding the observant spirit on its way, Doth she men's minds harmoniously dispose. The woods and streams are sympathetic powers, Fountains of meek suggestion, to the man Who with submissive energy would plan His way of life in close and heated hours. III How the dense morning compasses the town, As though there were no other place beyond, And with its sweeping mist bids us despond For the old forms which one by one sink down! How patiently the Minster stands, a vain And beautiful monition, from the hill Rising or rather growing, mute and still Within a cavern of dark mist and rain! IV O venerable Pile! whose awful gloom From my first boyish days hath been the sign And symbol to me of the Faith divine Of which thou art a birth! from out the womb Thou springest of the old majestic past, Colossal times, which daily from the heart Of this dear land with lingering steps depart, Furling the mighty shadows that they cast. V Past greatness is the shelter and the screen, Beneath whose shade high hearts serenely lurk, Catching true inspiration for the work Which shall in other days be known and seen. But greatness, which men do not understand, Is felt a pressure not to be endured, Where barren minds are painfully immured, Like dwarfs within the grasp of giant hand. VI How patiently the Minster stands! So well Hath it time's mute indignities sustained, It might for its own beauty have detained The grandeur now withdrawing. Hark! the knell! Durham, the uncrowned city, in meet grief Prepares to celebrate within the shrine The obsequies of her last Palatine; And nature's gloom is felt as a relief. VII And hark—the knell again! Within the town Through the old narrow streets the sinuous crowds, Meeting and parting, like the trailing clouds Of a spent storm, are on the Abbey thrown. How patiently it stands! Once more—the knell! The crowd with silent agitation stirred And a contagious awe, like some shy herd, Shrinks at the ponderous voice of that deep bell. VIII The blameless prelate in the antique gloom Of the low western Galilee is laid, In the dark pageantry of death arrayed, Nigh to the Venerable Beda's tomb: And in the distant east beside the shrine There is a grave, a little earth up-cast, Wherein to-day a rich and solemn Past Must be entombed with this old Palatine. IX See how with drooping pall and nodding plume In many a line along the misty nave The sombre garments of the clergy wave, Bearing the last prince-bishop to his tomb! And, as the burden swayeth to and fro, I see a glorious relic, most sublime, A dread bequest from out the olden time, Borne from the earth with ceremonial show. X To one old priest were Keys and Sceptre given, Two rights combined, the human and divine, Blended in one high office as a shrine Where earth might into contact come with Heaven. This homage of great times unto the Cross, All this magnificent conception, here Outstretched upon the Palatine's frail bier, Is borne away; and will men feel no loss? XI Hath not a sacred lamp gone out to-day With ominous extinction? Can ye fill, Wild men! the hallowed vases that ye spill, And light our darkened shrines with purer ray? O where shall trust and love have fitting scope? Our children will cry out for very dearth Of grandeur, fortified upon the earth As refuges for faith and holy hope. XII The cloud of music hushed still loads the air; The herald breaks the wand, while he proclaims The gentle Palatine's puissant names: Yon kingless throne is now for ever bare! This is a gesture, whereby we may solve The temper of the age; upon this day, And in St. Cuthbert's shrine, the times display The secret hinge on which they now revolve. XIII Cities, where ancient sacrilege was bold, Nature with tenderest rites doth consecrate Anew, and their remains incorporate With her own placid mounds and forests old: But an unholy action at its birth Doth visibly uncrown a place, laid low In all the rawness of dishonor: now There is a glory less upon the earth. XIV At night upon the Minster I looked down; In all the streets through dismal mist and rain The lights were twinkling; and the mighty fane Seemed o'er its sevenfold subject hills to frown. Now then let ages pass, o'er this gray shrine, Of uncrowned faith and formal prayer forlorn, Magnificent traditions all forsworn, And throne unpressed by lawful Palatine. XV Fortress of God! colossal Abbey! thou In thy stern grandeur shalt outlive the forms That thus unqueen thee, and above the storms Of coming change shalt lift thy reverend brow. Once more shall Host and Sacrifice be thine, When Cuthbert's bones, concealed from curious scorn, Down the grand aisles in triumph shall be borne, With jubilant psalms, by some new Palatine! CXLVIII.THE RUINED COTTAGE. I A rich and languid midsummer Thou dost from thine own spirit bring, And, like a pleased magician there, Thou standest in thy self-drawn ring; And from thine own abounding youth Thou spinnest threads of bright untruth, And weavest of hope's starry beams Upon love's busy loom a tapestry of dreams. II A sunlight to thyself thou art; Ah me! it is a hapless lot, And in old age exiles the heart Unto a bare, unsunny spot. Thou passest on from day to day, As though life were the Milky Way; Duty hath chartered not thy bliss, For joy well earned is no such twilight thing as this. III Come with me to this mountain vale, And in meek nature's twilight see In after years how wan and pale Thy self-illumined dream will be, Like yon poor dull and murky speck By sunset left a joyless wreck, What time its mellow slanting ray From out of Langdale sent its last long look this way. IV The evening wind is rude and high Upon this wild deserted green; The mountains in the pallid sky Rise up with outline cold and keen: The splashing lake, the rocking trees To me are mournful images; Like uncrowned household gods are they, Unworshipped now amid this pastoral decay. V Here once were happy peace and smiles, And no less happy, holy tears; Here once were love's domestic wiles, And constancy which grew with years; Here conjugal delights were lured, And simple trials were endured, And, with his helpmate at his side, The shepherd's cares were light, his sorrows sanctified. VI See here the drooping ash-tree shade Meet for the matron's out-door work, The common where the children played, The neighboring copse where they might lurk. Ah! many a merry sunburnt face Hath come and gone in this green place, And Loughrigg heard the echoes play— A year wakes fewer now than then were waked each day. VII I see the blue smoke rising up, The ruined house resume its roof, The streamlet in a rough stone cup Protected from the horse's hoof; I hear the vespers of the bees In those two sister linden trees; And there the gilded hollies shine Through the close network of the clambering eglantine. VIII I see the happy rustic pair, O how my heart the vision stirs! And four sweet children, wild and fair, Peeping among the junipers; While o'er the lake with tremulous swell Eight strikes upon the chapel bell, Within its cincture of green trees Drawing all thoughts unto its pensive sanctities. IX Did ever dream come true like this? If o'er the wide earth we could roam Should we detect a better bliss, A simpler or a nobler home? A few souls moving day and night Within an orbit of delight, While they with mutual help fulfil In meek self-sacrifice and want our Father's Will! X Believe me there is not a bliss To bear the pressure of hard life, Which hath not been well-forged like this, And tempered in our mortal strife. Old age is miserably poor Which hath not thus laid by its store Of cheerfulness from good deeds done, And lawful prisage laid on conquests duly won. XI Yet even here behold the wreck, That voiceless tenement behold; The past a sun-deserted speck, Whose story is thus sadly told By all this melancholy round Of lonely form and cheerless sound, Which to the grieving spirit call With plaintive wooing, a most touching pastoral. XII And in the lone and pale ash-trees, And o'er the white and withered grass, With what a moaning doth the breeze O'er this unhaunted moorland pass. It makes me sad to see it throw The blossoms from the linden bough, While by the little waterfalls The white owl hoots from out the ivy-strangled walls. XIII And here and there and everywhere, The eyeless casements all about, Like lost babes wailing in the air, The piteous nightbirds ever shout. It is a thought to consecrate This moorland with pathetic state,— That Human Nature many a day Here lived and loved, and like a cloud hath passed away. CXLIX.THE ROTHAY. Dear Stream! upon thy grassy brink I often am constrained to think That thou must so enamoured be Of thine own pensive melody, It is a wonder that some day Thou dost not thy soft current stay, And listen in a green recess Unto the sudden silentness, Which would be in the widowed air, Were thy sweet voice no longer there. How dull would all the meadows look Bereaved of their own tinkling brook! The fringing birchtrees that beat time With tendrils dipping to the chime, How sad would they be and forlorn, Were there no breath, of murmur born, To agitate with cool delight Their moistened tresses day and night! In truth that pleasant shady sadness Would all its meek reserve of gladness, Like a mute mourner, soon forswear, Were there no choral waters there With changeful note to suit a tale To all who pass along the vale. I do believe the very bees Would quit the roadside linden trees, When summer afternoons are long, Didst thou not wile them with thy song To keep up in the well-pleased air A drowsy emulation there. Indeed, sweet Brook! we cannot part With thee; for to the vale thou art, To grieve, to comfort, to rejoice, An altogether needful voice. And yet, dear Stream! I wonder much A deep desire doth never touch Thy waterbreaks awhile to stay, Self-gathered in yon mossy bay, Awhile in quiet depths to glisten, Awhile the distant sounds to listen Of thine own gushings far above, Which like the wooing of a dove, That penetrates the breezeless wood, The breath upon thy sylvan flood Might waft into thy curious ear, Confusing sweetly far with near. And better still if from on high There came no kindred melody; For then it were a joy to know What would be, didst thou cease to flow; And it were sweet for thee to measure The fulness of the daily treasure Which thou art to this vale always, Blythe Chanter of a hundred lays! So kindly hearts might love to see How bare a place the world would be, Bereaved of all the lustre won From what hath been or may be done Through faith, through love, self-sacrifice, And our domestic charities, Which, as we waken every morn, Remind us life may yet be borne. Ah! Rothay! now on thee doth wait For evermore a poet's fate, A captive, bound both eye and ear, In his own sweetness prisoner, To whom his crafty melody Is no such power of simple glee As unto others it may seem, Who lie and listen by the stream Of song, which flows in many a fall Of thought and language musical. Then mightest thou begin once more A deeper strain than heretofore, Cheered—not by knowing that thou art A power with which we cannot part, Nor any other conscious pride Unmeet for such fair river-side— But by the buoyant powers which rise With something of a meek surprise, When partial self-restraint hath given To common joys the bliss of Heaven. For when sequestered from sweet thought By weary cares, we have been brought With thirsty heart and eager want Once more unto our pensive haunt, It seems like thee, my household River, Brighter and lovelier far than ever, With fresh dimensions of true beauty, Seen in relief against hard duty. O joyous art thou, festal Earth! For every month with some new birth Of glory waits on thee: there is A beating pulse of truest bliss Deep in the black and glossy lake, The yew-crowned steep, the hazel brake: A golden light of gladness quivers Submersed in the transparent rivers; And there are ministers and powers Among the still or beckoning flowers; The ship-like clouds, which overwhelm The azure sky, have at their helm An inward love to steer them right: Clear visitations of delight Thrill through the lone and swampy ground, With sight at unison with sound: The creatures in their perfect motions, The tides and currents of the oceans, The growing trees,—for ever move By most transcendent law of love And blameless will, yet have no power Of self-restraint—not for an hour!— And therefore, blessèd Earth! it is, One moment of pure mortal bliss, Aye or pure mortal grief, is worth A hundred years of thy mute mirth, A hundred years of moons that range 'Twixt sameness beautiful and change Which is not change, but to man's eye His inward mutability Reflected in the earth and sky. No love for its own sake can we Bestow on thy tranquillity; But, when received into the strife Of feeling heart or pensive life, Our spirit sheds on thee a dew Which doth almost create thee new; And then, O Earth! how dear thou art, How sacred to each tender heart! Thou knowest not the wondrous blending Of bright and dark in the ascending Scale of life, the never ending Weaving of all times and places, And charities and wrongs and graces, Of love and sorrow, morn and even, Youth and age, and earth and heaven. No joy is realized until By power of the harmonious will And the submissive reason, it Will, all unquestioning, admit Stern duty with a yielding grace To be enthroned upon its place; And hath been taught to come and go, As task and leisure ebb and flow, And it for duty's coming waits A humble portress at the gates. Thou canst not know, dear Stream! the joy, Without misgiving or alloy, Which abstinence and self-control Spread like a sunrise, o'er the soul. Thou canst not know what flight is given, Unto the very doors of heaven, To hearts which from self-sacrifice, Like birds from lowly places, rise, Who soar the highest when their mirth Is humblest on the lowly earth. Thy song cheers not thyself, dear River! Because it is a song for ever; It is thyself, thy life, and not A gift, a separable lot, Of whose deep tenderness and beauty Thou canst by self-restraint and duty Win sweet returns or augmentations; It hath no daily new creations— Fresh births which come from sapient glee, From wisdom, from simplicity, When mortal joys themselves refrain For virtue's sake, then flow again. So are we made; unquiet pleasure, Which the calm spirit cannot measure, Endureth not, and is no treasure. The mirth we cannot put away Is but a mirth on its first day. The joy which we can not restrain Is but a liberty from pain. Where self and pleasure are but one, That soul is morally undone! CL.ENGLISH HEDGES. I Not without deep memorial truth are ye, Partitions of sweet thorn! which intersect Our blythest counties, bidding us reflect Full oft upon our rural ancestry, The unambitious thanes of Saxon days; Who with their modest manors well content, Of corn and mead and fragrant bean-field blent, And woody pasture, lived in simple ways And patriarchal virtues, ere the hand Of Norman rule was felt; or feudal right, Baneful exotic! settled like a blight On the free customs of the pastoral land. II Behold—a length of hundred leagues displayed— That web of old historic tapestry With its green patterns, broidered to the eye, Is with domestic mysteries inlaid! Here hath a nameless sire in some past age In quaint uneven stripe or curious nook, Clipped by the wanderings of a snaky brook, Carved for a younger son an heritage. There set apart, an island in a bower, With right of road among the oakwoods round, Are some few fields within a ring-fence bound, Perchance a daughter's patrimonial dower. III So may we dream, while to our fancy come Kind incidents and sweet biographies, Scarce fanciful, as flowing from the ties And blissful bonds which consecrate our home To be an earthly heaven. From shore to shore That ample, wind-stirred net-work doth ensnare Within its delicate meshes many a rare And rustic legend, which may yield good store Of touching thought unto the passenger. Domestic changes, families decayed, And love or hate, in testaments displayed By dying men, still in the hedgerows stir. IV When Rome her British Eagles did recall, Time saw the ages weave that web of green Assiduously upon the rural scene, Ere yet the lowly-raftered Saxon hall Was watched from Norman fortalice. The fields Escutcheons were, borne by those equal thanes, While herald spring went wandering up the lanes, Blazoning with green and white the yeomen's shields, And as the Church grew there, beneath her eyes The breadth of hedgerows grew with her, not loth To be, as freedom is, an undergrowth Of that true mother of all liberties. V The Saxon hedgerows stand, though twice assailed; Once greedy barons in their pride of birth For hunting grounds imparked the fertile earth, Till peasant joys and pastoral ditties failed. Now upstart wealth absorbs both far and nigh The small ancestral farms: woe worth the day, When fortunes overgrown shall eat away The heart of our old English yeomanry! The hedges still survive, shelters for flowers, An habitation for the singing birds, Cool banks of shadow grateful to the herds, A charm scarce known in any land but ours. VI Ye modest relics of a simple past, Most frail and most enduring monument, Ye still are here, when Norman Keep is rent And cruel Chace disparked into a waste Of cheerful tillage: ye uninjured rise, To nature and to human wants allied, Therefore outliving works of lordly pride, How rightly dear for what ye symbolize! Long may the Saxon hieroglyphic stand, A precious trophy in the yeoman's eye, The wisdom of our ancient polity Written in leafy cypher o'er the land! CLI.MOUNTAIN TARNS. I O askest thou of me What store of thoughtful glee By mountain tarns is lying, That I to such grim nooks From my dull-hearted books Should evermore be flying? II Go thou, and spend an hour In autumn fog and shower Amid the thundering rills, Or hear the breezy sigh Of summer quiet die Among the noonday hills. III The eagle's royal soul Is nurtured in the roll And echo of the thunder, And feeds for evermore Amid the summits hoar On sights and sounds of wonder. IV The murmur of the stone With hoarse and hollow moan Self-loosened from the height,— The waterfall's white showers In midnight's deepest hours Creating sound and light,— V The pauses in the blowing Of winds, when oxen lowing Are heard from vales beneath, The under-world of care Scarce burdening the air With its poor plaintive breath,— VI The fragrance of the noon, The nearness of the moon, The swampy mosses tingling, The strife of peace and noise, Like the sorrows and the joys In earthly lots commingling,— VII To all such sight and sound Is the eagle's being bound, A destiny of bliss; These spells his spirit wake, These influences make The eagle what he is. VIII So I of lowly birth, A workman on the earth, Would cast myself apart, That I a little time From dreariness sublime Might win a royal heart. IX The golden-crownèd kings Are often abject things; I would not be as they: But mountain winds and waves Teach no men to be slaves, But with high minds obey. X Great emperors forget, In jewelled places set, The human heart below, And with no fellows near They often cease to hear Its holy ebb and flow. XI But I from mountain throne Would oftentimes come down, And leave unto the breeze And cataract to fill With echoes at their will My dreary royalties. XII I would in mountain haunt But quicken the sweet want Of love and blisses mild; And I would alternate My pomp of regal state With the humors of a child. XIII There is a power to bless In hill-side loneliness, In tarns and dreary places, A virtue in the brook, A freshness in the look Of mountain's joyless faces. XIV And I would have my heart From littleness apart, A love-anointed thing, Be set above my kind, In my unfettered mind A veritable king. XV And so when life is dull, Or when my heart is full Because coy dreams have frowned, I wander up the rills To stones and tarns and hills,— I go there to be crowned. CLII.OUR THOUGHTS ARE GREATER THAN OURSELVES. Our thoughts are greater than ourselves, our dreams Ofttimes more solid than our acts; our hope With more of substance and of shadow teems Than our thin joys, and hath a nobler scope. O sons of men! there is a Presence here, Here in our own undying spirits, which With an unearthly wealth doth oft enrich The reason hourly sanctified by fear. Herewith men prophesy, herewith men press To their own hearts in studious loneliness Forms greater than they dare to tell: beneath The shadow of their own imaginings They sit, withdrawn and sheltered; for a wreath Encircles them, a wreath of Angel's wings. CLIII.I FEEL A CHANGE. I feel a change,—and yet I know not how Or where or when, or what it doth betoken; But sure I am that voices which have spoken Daily within my soul are speechless now. For thought or fancy, hope, joy, smile and tear, My being is not what it was last year. And a new power, which will not yet reveal Its name and purpose, hath already gone This way or that, as though it fain would steal And climb unchallenged to some inward throne: While I with fretful guess go sounding on Depth after depth of my vexed mind, to dodge The bold, unbidden stranger, and dislodge All influence, unmeasured and unknown. CLIV.EFFUSION ON HEARING OF A FRIEND'S DEATH FROM FEVER AT NAPLES. I And he is dead! Mourn, all ye moonlit hills, Ye woods that sleep so sweetly in the beams, Thou lake that twinklest like the light in dreams, Thou dappled sky; and ye, O tuneful rills, Thus charmed to silentness, awake and call For power unto the raving waterfall! II And he is dead! Dear, blessèd spirit! there By the wild river doth his dwelling stand, The one dark spot in all the moonlit land, Which lies beneath this mountain summit bare. O Nature! my o'erburdened heart relieve, Ye woods and hills, in mournful concert grieve! III Up many a vale I see the glimmering light Of scattered farms; I hear the sheepdogs bay The quiet hanging moon, and far away The echos travel. O how calm is night! And through the gloom I can no peak descry, Which was not dear to Edward's gentle eye. IV And he is passed away,—with snowy sail No more shall cleave Winander's azure deeps, No more shall homeward wend while moonlight sleeps On Brathay's ivied bridge and woody vale! All, all is passed; a few calm months have rolled, And all that world of joy is cold—is cold! V O Italy! thou wert his waking dream, And thou hast proved his grave; we little know The ills which from self-chosen pleasures flow. Ah me! at length the moon with silver gleam Hath struck his house-top, and the glittering rill Shoots past the bridge, and then is dark and still. VI To-day I heard the cuckoo first this year; It rose from his own grounds, an ominous cry, Which with old arts and wiles advanced more nigh,— Then thrown far off, when it had been most near: This do I fondly note; such chances are Not without light in sorrow's calendar. VII Thus yearly hath the warning deathbell tolled Into my startled ear amid the chime Of youth's long holydays; and every time Bereavement seems more desolate and cold: And I am now to grief less reconciled, Than when I was in pureness more a child. VIII Ah woful lot! when sorrow hath become A source of self-disturbance, not a thing From which the growths of faith and meekness spring; The world too much, too long hath been my home; And this chill shock goes further, deeper in, As though 'twere fathoming new depths of sin. IX And rainest thou, O Moon! so calm a shower Upon Vesuvio's beacon-height, the sea And the white crescent of Parthenope, The garden terrace, and sweet lemon-bower? And canst thou strike from out the hollow skies The tranquil spot where that dear outcast lies? X I too within the moonlight of sad thought Can compass far-off joys and long-past days: Memory can strike with most pathetic rays Kind pensive looks and tender actions wrought In times bygone, and bring them round her now, White flowers, tear-freshened, for pale sorrow's brow. XI How beautiful are thy constraints, O Death! On our affections so benignly felt, Making all hearts, ranks, ages melt To one true brotherhood before thy breath! I feel this night a fresh access of love For my lost friend, which Heaven doth not reprove. XII Merciful God! with whom the spirits are, Most holy Saviour! on the mountain top The earth Thou madest, overspread with hope, Breathes consolation in the quiet air: Death is Thine earnest that our souls are free, O blessèd are the dead who die in Thee! XIII Yea blessèd, else would earth or sky display Some trouble when the youthful are laid low. So soft, so calm may be the moonlight show, When I, perchance still young, am called away, No trouble stir that night on Brathay's shore When I can hear his woodland voice no more! CLV.THE CONTRAST. I O earth, meek mother! with thy powers at war, How rudely 'gainst thy harmonies we strike! The voice of men and cities seems to jar Thy sounds more than thy stillness: how unlike These pastoral bleatings or this wild bird's wails Absorbed so kindly into all these mountain vales— II Absorbed, or rather by true love prolonged Through echo's lonely outposts in far links, And justly; else earth surely would have wronged That old coeval sound: but whoso thinks That she to men's mutations will be chained Deems lightly of the place to which she is ordained. III Weak and dejected, for the gift of song, Intemperately used, had sapped my health, I lived in open air the whole day long In hill or wood, extracting thence a wealth Of chaste delights my future toil to bless, Mingled with just self-blame for fancy's late excess. IV Within a natural temple of old pine, On whose grey columns and red withered floor The sun with noontide force could barely shine, I lay at ease; around me a gay store Of cuckoo-plant, with white and winking eyes Furled and unfurled, among the starting roots did rise. V Invisible creatures rustled in the moss And the crisp leaves; a wild suspicious eye Looked from a thrush's nest: and at a loss To find his master, closely harbored nigh, My dog at times among the boughs was seen, Like some white thing that floats deep in the waters green. VI And by the tiny trumpets of the bees Was I well soothed, and the blythe insect hum; And winds were born and died within the trees, Prisoned and stifled in the leafy gloom: The plaint of lambs, the tinkling of a brook, Refined by distance, came unto this sombre nook. VII Aloft the stockdoves seemed with their deep cooing All the broad wood to quiet and control, An eloquence like the continual wooing Of holy thoughts within a Christian soul: Remote I saw some horses in a plough, The world—seen, as the Saints should see it, far below. VIII God's blessing was upon the earth, all bound In deep content and joy from vale to height; There was that concord of harmonious sound, Those thrillings, almost vocal, of strong light, Suggesting to transported ear and eye A present Power, diviner than tranquillity. IX Homeward I went, with thoughts such as might wait Upon the vision in that shelter given, In meditation chastened yet elate, When all things seem transparent, and true Heaven Glows through all earthly loveliness and power, As though the veil were being consumed hour after hour. X Then suddenly by duty was I led Unto a scene of desperate misery, A moaning sinner on his dying bed, A drunkard—oh how unprepared to die! Too weak for prayer, for Sacrament unmeet, O Heaven! what sight was this a pastor's eye to greet! XI But let us veil the scene: a cooling breeze Through the porch honeysuckle gently sighing, The singing birds, clear hills, and budding trees— Amid all this the sinner lay a-dying: O when I quitted that most dismal room The outward sunshine was all baffled by the gloom. XII Most inharmonious world! which can compress Such sweetness and such horror in an hour, As though all beauty and all fearfulness Turned on one hinge, were but one folding door, Each counteracting each, with woe and mirth In mutual eclipse o'ershadowing the earth. XIII Such and so solemn is the pastor's life, Strange alternations which, well weighed, may yield Reasoning sublime, and contemplation rife With virtuous purposes by faith to build The soul which doth among such fortunes range. The death-bell tolls: Christ aid him in his fearful change! CLVI.ONCE MORE AMID THE ALDER TREES. I Once more amid the alder trees, Once more among the hills, Mid dewy grass and fading leaves And the blue steam on the rills. II Once more amid the pomp of clouds, Once more in shade and shower, What wonder is it I should weep For joy of autumn's power? III One year unto another calls In most mysterious ways: Autumn to autumn joins, and wakes The old autumnal days. IV In springtide thus the jocund past One long, long springtide seems, And summer shapes and finishes The bygone summer's dreams. V Such separate prerogative Doth in the seasons lie, And of sweet use may wise men make This deep consistency. VI Dear native land! dear English friends! Now doubly dear are ye: Is it a trouble or a joy Wherewith ye welcome me? VII Since last I walked through withered fern What tides of sight and sound To far-off seas and foreign streams My pliant heart have bound! VIII Mid gorgeous cities, stirring lands, Mid wonder, change, and mirth, For months and months there was to me No England on the earth. IX I saw the fruit-tree roads of France, The ancient Lombard plain, And Venice in her white sunshine Still sitting by the main. X And oh! how blue were all the bays, How strange the desert peace, The marbles hoar, the olives grey In old heroic Greece. XI And bright was May in your green haunts, Ye sweet Propontid isles! And bright along the Bosphorus Were summer's evening smiles. XII All up the wild Danubian plain, In Transylvanian dells, By Mur's romantic castled heights And Drava's mountain wells, XIII Along the shining bends of Inn, In old Bavarian towns, By many a deep green Austrian lake, On bleak Bohemian downs, XIV From hill and stream and ruin hoar— Grave lessons did I learn, Deep wisdom poured by earth herself From her own ancient urn. XV Now is it all a dream, a thing Gone with the buried past, A vision broken up, a light Which had no life to last. XVI And cheerfully, like vernal plants That pierce the April earth, Last autumn's thoughts come calmly up With old autumnal mirth: XVII Calmly and cheerfully they come As though I had been here Nor left this single mossy bank Through all the bygone year. XVIII Thought must be earned by thought, and truth From other truth be won: Next year the fruit will come of seed In this year's travel sown. CLVII.A VISION OF BRIGHT SEAS. I I never think without a thrill Of wild and pure delight Of all the leagues of blue, blue sea, Which I have sailed o'er merrily In day or dead of night. II With moon and stars, at morn and eve, In sunny wind and shower, How often hath it worked in me,— That mystery of the kingly sea, With joyous spells of power! III My heart doth burn whene'er I gaze From o'er the vessel's side, And see the tremulous sunbeams sleep Far down within the azure deep, And rocking in the tide. IV And I could sit for hours and watch The white phosphoric track, Which like a streaky firebrand burns, Where'er the foamy rudder turns Across night's ocean black. V Methinks that laid, as I am now, Upon the rack of pain, The briny seaweed's fragrant breath On old St. Hilda's breezy heath Might woo health back again. VI O it is well sick men should go Unto the royal sea; For on their souls as on a glass, From its bright fields the breath doth pass Of its infinity. VII Go forth from thy sick room this day, My languid heart! go forth; Mount on the merry moorland breeze, And sweep o'er all the murmuring seas We've known in south or north! VIII How quick the mountains melt away The girdle of dark firs! And Wansfell's broad opposing bank Fades off into a shining blank, And see—the vision stirs! IX Waves rock and flow, ships come and go, And cities are displayed Apparelled in transparent air, With quays and harbors: surely ne'er Was Merlin so obeyed! X There Genoa bends along the shore Beneath her Apennines; There emulous waters force their way Into the locked and jealous bay Where old Venetia shines. XI There are the low Dalmatian isles, The gems on Adria's arms. Albania's glens and white Corfu, And Græcia's belt of waters blue, And deep Ægean calms. XII Fling wide the antechamber door, Where sweet Propontis catches Sophia's gleam at break of day, Or plaintive wail from cupola Repeating the night watches. XIII Thou, hospitable Euxine! thou Art not forgotten here, Upon whose undulating breast, Spite of all legends, did I rest Calm as on Windermere. XIV Oh bliss! what lights the sun and moon Have scattered o'er the sea, Which, though to others they would seem Confused into a radiant dream, Are all distinct to me. XV My mother taught me how to love The mystery of the sea; She sported with my childish wonder At its white waves and gentle thunder,— Like a man's deep voice to me. XVI When in my soul dim thoughts awoke, She helped to set them free; I learned from ocean's murmurings How infinite, eternal things, Though viewless, yet could be. XVII In gentle moods I love the hills Because they bound my spirit; But to the broad, blue sea I fly, When I would feel the destiny Immortal souls inherit. CLVIII.THE YEAR AFTER TRAVELLING. See how last year is coming back again! Dost thou not feel bright cities work in thee, At which we touched upon the midland sea, And fair cathedrals towering on the plain? Through all the gathered mould of hope and fear, The heap of wintry things which we have cast Upon our memories, relics of the past Work up in little earthquakes from last year. And is it not a very pleasant trouble To feel this year our calendar is double? My thoughts have been bewildered all the day, As though I walked on air, not on the ground, And, from the date, I have this evening found It was a misty sight of Genoa. CLIX.GENOA. I I am where snowy mountains round me shine; But in sweet vision truer than mine eyes I see pale Genoa's marble crescent rise Between the water and the Apennine. II On the sea-bank she couches like a deer, A creature giving light with her soft sheen, While the blue ocean and the mountain green, Pleased with the wonder, alway gaze on her. III And day and night the mild sea-murmur fills The corridors of her cool palaces, Taking the freshness from the orange trees, A fragrant gift into the peaceful hills. IV And from the balustrades into the street From time to time there are voluptuous showers, Gentle descents, of shaken lemon flowers, Snapped by the echo of the passing feet. V And when the sun his noonday height hath gained How mute is all that slumberous Apennine, Upon whose base the streaks of green turf shine With the black olive-gardens interveined! VI How fair it is when, in the purple bay, Of the soft sea the clear-edged moon is drinking, Or the dark sky amid the shipmasts winking With summer lightning over Corsica! VII O Genoa! thou art a marvellous birth, A clasp which joins the mountains and the sea; And the two powers do homage unto thee As to a matchless wonder of the earth. VIII Can life be common life in spots like these, Where they breathe breath from orange gardens wafted? O joy and sorrow surely must be grafted On stems apart for these bright Genoese. IX The place is islanded amid her mirth; The very girdle of her beauty thrown About her in men's minds, a virgin zone, Marks her a spot unmated on the earth. X I hear the deep coves of the Apennine Filled with a gentle trouble of sweet bells; And the blue tongues of sea that pierce the dells, As conscious of our Lady's feast-day, shine. XI For Genoa the Proud for many an age Hath been pre-eminent as tributary Unto the special service of St. Mary, The sinless Virgin's chosen appanage. XII I see the streets with very stacks of flowers Choked up, a wild and beautiful array, And in my mind I thread my fragrant way Once more amid the rich and cumbrous bowers. XIII And, unforgotten beauty! by the bay I see the two boys and the little maiden, With crimson tulips for the Virgin laden, Wending along the road from Spezia. XIV Sister! thou askest why this evening long I have in selfish silence been immured,— This is the vision which I have endured, Shaped, to win pardon, in a simple song. XV It would augment thy happiness and mine, If thou, dear Ellen! could'st but share with me This magic vision of the Midland Sea, And the white city with her Apennine! CLX.NAMES OF GOOD OMEN. THERAPIA ON THE BOSPHORUS. I The sunny wisdom of the Greeks All o'er the earth is strewed: On every dark and awful place, Rude hill and haunted wood, The beautiful bright people left A name of omen good. II They would not have an evil word Weigh heavy on the breeze, They would not darken mountain side, Nor stain the shining seas, With names, of some disastrous past The unwise witnesses. III Here legendary Argo touched In this blue-watered bay; Here dark Medea in pursuit Her poisons cast away, Polluting even the odorous shades Of pure Therapia. IV Look how the interlacing trees Their glowing blossoms wreathe! Is this a spot for poison plants, For crime or savage death? The Greeks endured not that on it Should pass so dire a breath: V Unlike the children of romance,— From out whose spirit deep The touch of gloom hath passed on glen And mountain lake and steep, On Devil's Bridge and Raven's Tower And lovelorn Maiden's Leap: VI Who sought in cavern, wood, and dell, Where'er they could lay bare The path of ill, and localized Terrific legends there, Leaving a hoarse and ponderous name To haunt the very air. VII Not so the radiant-hearted Greeks, Who hesitated still To offend the blessed Presences Which earth and ocean fill; Whose tongues, elsewhere so eloquent, Stammered at words of ill. VIII All places, where their presence was Upon the fruitful earth, By kindly law were clasped within The circle of their mirth, And in their spirits had a new And consecrated birth. IX O bless them for it, traveller! The fair-tongued ancients bless! Who thus from land and sea trod out All footmarks of distress, Illuminating earth with their Own inward cheerfulness. X Unto the Axine Sea they sent A name of better feeling; Dark powers into Eumenides, A gentle change! were stealing, And poison-stained Therapia Became the Bay of Healing! CLXI.A DAY UPON THE EUXINE SEA. I Seven times doth Asia's flowery coast give place To Europe's shrubby cliffs and verdant Thrace; And Europe into seven sweet bays retires Where summer sunrise shoots his pearly fires; There holy East and royal West are meeting, Each from the other's headlands still retreating. With currents and with counter-currents seven The cold, bright waters, blue as bluest Heaven, Seem like the beating pulses of the free And angry spirit of the Euxine Sea. II Lift up the veil of legendary gloom Which hangs before that dreadful sea, the womb, So seemed it to the reverent men of old, Where every direful shape and form untold Of dark disaster lurked; upon whose flood A mist, and no mere sea-born mist, did brood With heavy, hanging shadow: it was then A sea for gods and heroes, not for men; Yet with a kindly name they worshipped thee, The offering of their lips, dread Euxine Sea! III With what a very diadem of fear They crowned thee king of waters! Far and near, The Delian blessing his Ægean calm, Or Attic dweller at some inland farm Amid his oliveyards, had many a tale Enough to make the listening throng turn pale. Perplexing phantoms chasing ships behind, Mists, monsters, sudden wreck, and wondrous wind,— Such were their dim uncheerful thoughts of thee, Thou legend-circled thing, dread Euxine Sea! IV Thy wandering waves had limits in the air, Begotten of men's faith: they thought not where Nor yet how near thou wert, but cast thee far Unto the confines of their thoughts, a bar Not reverently to be o'erleaped: the past One streak of light across the darkness cast; One pathway, moonbeam-like, the gloom did break,— 'Twas Argo passing with her burning wake; And in a cloud of troubled minstrelsy They wrapped thy sacred name, dread Euxine Sea! V But see this harmless glossy-surfaced ocean, Cradling my boat with quiet-throbbing motion! This is no dismal threshold to be strown With horrid wreck, no tempest-spirit's throne. Faith fails the legends; the eye seeks but sees No monument, no twin Symplegades. Oh how transfigured, waves and headlands drear! The very soul of May is breathing here! Such skies, winds, waters—can they truly be Upon the veritable Euxine Sea? VI The hollow waves, like summer thunder, roar On Thracia's rocks and low Silistria's shore. There Russia looms, or mistwreaths cheat the eye, Upon the horizon line of history; And there, where yon white ship hath set her helm, Are Persia's havens deep, the garden-realm, The clime where earth, their thoughtless earth, discloses Nought to the poet's soul but wine and roses. These are the shadows, bygone or to be, Which flit along thy coasts, dread Euxine Sea! VII Now that the Strait, her seven fair bays unbinding, Draws the caique through each blue snaky winding, My heart is lighted on from cape to cape By torchlike song or legendary shape, While from the flowery Kandili there come Cool odorous breaths to old Byzantium. The sight of thee, dread Euxine! calm and near, Hath made thee not the less a thing to fear; Else why this troubled thrill which works in me When I have seen and touched the Euxine Sea? VIII But lo! Stamboul! A thousand sunset-fires Are gilding tall ship masts and cypress spires. White palace roof and glittering kiosk, Old Latin tower, rude gate, and pillared mosque, Trees, houses, fountains, ships—float off and rise, Like clouds instinct with light, into the skies. What shall Arabian prose or Persian verse In after years to my dull ear rehearse, When eye hath seen upon a Mayday even Stamboul by sunset lifted into Heaven? IX To-day my thirsty spirit sought to drink Of dreadful legends on the Black Sea's brink; This sunset is a trouble in my soul; Deep in my heart I heard the Euxine roll, I felt it in me as a mighty thought, The block whence forms of grandeur might be wrought: But now 'twixt light and gloom my mind is tossed, Bright thoughts in dark, and dark in bright, are lost; Once more an untouched thing, outside of me, I hear the murmur of the Euxine Sea! CLXII.THE PLAINS OF HUNGARY. I O if in a valley With close mountains round, Or in the green alley Of a woodland ground There be a joy in nearness to each sight and sound,— II Or if, in the bowers Of a pleasance old, There be joy for hours In the sheets of gold And red and white and blue, in formal shapes unrolled,— III Or if in a ruin With weeds overgrown, Where time is undoing That which men have done, It is a joy to be hemmed in with aisles of stone,— IV And if from all places Close and desolate, As from silent faces Through a convent grate, Sad thoughts and gentle ones on the beholder wait,— V There is strong emotion And a dancing mirth From the sight of ocean, And wide plains of earth, Which is not a less heavenly, though a wilder birth. VI Though there be a glory On the famous fields, Which chivalric story With its sunset gilds, And where the cypher of the past a wisdom yields, VII There is glory brighter On the desert scene, Where the only writer That hath ever been Is the pure sky above with its unhindered sheen. VIII And the earth's sweet changes Are a quiet past, Whose soft action ranges O'er the solemn waste, And where green grass grows now, wild waters once were cast. IX To the misty sunlight Is its bosom bare, And the flaky moonlight Makes no shadows there, And it is free to all outpourings of bright air. X Whether pearly morning Doth herself transfuse In the sky, adorning All the myriad dews, Or twilight steals from sunset banners of red hues; XI Whether noonday glimmers In the hazy dome; Or, like noisy swimmers Scattering the foam, The hailstorms with white oars across the desert roam; XII Whether night's strong motion, Without sound or tool, The bright earth and ocean Strives to overrule, Lights wander here and there, and still the scene is beautiful. XIII In the boundless quiet Of the misty plain, The wild horses riot Without bit or rein; The fatal touch of man hath not passed on their mane. XIV With their broad eyes flashing, Beautiful and free, The swift herd is dashing In its untamed glee Across the plain, as ships may dash across the sea: XV And far off delaying By the shrunken rills, With a haughty neighing The lone air it fills,— Fierce creatures in the joy of their own mighty wills. XVI Day with silvery brightness Dawned there upon me; The hoarfrost with its whiteness, Like a moonlit sea, For leagues of land both far and wide gleamed mistily. XVII From the pallid glimmer Of the morning moon Till the plains grew dimmer In the vaporous noon, In which a tree or cloud would be a blessèd boon,— XVIII In relays and courses At rude cabins given, We galloped, like wild horses, Till the cool fresh even, And we saw two things all day,—the green plain and heaven! XIX Once we saw the rolling Of the Danube nigh, Once we heard the tolling Of churchbells wafted by, But otherwise we were as wild birds in the sky. XX But towards night less dreary Was the grassy way, And we passed, unweary, Villages that lay, Oases, in a belt of light acacia. XXI Still we came no nigher The Carpathian chain, A fence of white haze-fire Compassing the plain, Like land, which may be cloud or land, seen o'er the main. XXII On the desert ample Evening's chilly hour Bade the breezes trample In their wildest power, And o'er the twilight plain like viewless horses scour. XXIII Soon the winds were shaking All the ether blue, Where the mists were making The ambrosial dew, And with a moaning surge a solemn tempest grew. XXIV And I felt my spirit On the storm ascending, Where for ever near it A dim shape was bending, Like a wild horse herd across the desert wending. XXV And my thoughts were going From me with wild force, Like the white hairs flowing From the dashing horse; I laughed whene'er the strong wind struck me in its course. XXVI We met a serf belated On the dusky plain, With his waggon freighted With the baron's grain; He was half blinded with the whirling sleet and rain. XXVII And I felt it better In the desert drear To be without fetter Of submissive fear; And I cried out in anger to the peasant near,— XXVIII “Leave thy waggon naked To the angry sky, Let thy thirst be slakèd With earth's liberty, For freedom is a vaster thing than slavery.” XXIX But the long-haired vassal Looked at me confounded, As in hour of wassail By young lords surrounded, When biting scoff hath e'en his abject spirit wounded. XXX When on every feature I saw fear and pain, I felt for the poor creature On that lonesome plain: Though storms without raged on, my heart was calm again. XXXI Men there are who think not That great words unmeet Are wells whence we drink not Waters clear and sweet, And wonder the world stays not at such words its feet. XXXII Such are liberators With their spirits lifted To the mood of traitors, From their good end shifted, For lack of sympathy on frothy shallows drifted. XXXIII Surely it is better We should not undo This wild vassal's fetter, Lest his heart should rue His altered lot, as men set free too early do. XXXIV But the storm is over; And with oakwoods walled, We, with quail and plover For the night installed, Are in the moonlit heart of the Bakonver Wald. CLXIII.THE RAFT FROM LINZ. I Another bend among the hills, One other bend, and we shall hear Among the green o'erhanging trees The rocky Wirbel boiling near. II Upon the Danube and the woods Lay evening's red and troubled gleam, And calmly, as a lifeless thing, The raft from Linz went down the stream. III And then how softly rose the hymn For Mary's succour in the strait, And that good Angels in the pool To steer the little craft might wait. IV It bent and strained, and in the foam A while the crazy vessel quivered; And then it glided like a swan, St. Mary hath the raft delivered. V And there the convent boat appears To ask an alms of all who pass, Oblation made with willing heart To Mary and St. Nicholas. VI And thus to great Vienna bound, The boatmen watch the stars all night, And for their hymn and for their alms They deem the weather calm and bright. VII Yet some dare blame the holy faith, As if to untrue forms it clings, While thus unto the unseen world For blessing every thought it brings. VIII And those who, safe in modern powers, Heed not the whirlpool in their way, And count the men of Linz untaught, Are in true lore less taught than they. IX Alas! how oft hath science made The heart obtuse, the eye untrue, Obscuring providential tracks With veils a woodman's faith sees through! X We want the earth left to ourselves; And signs where God doth hide to bless We class, as though, in classing them, We took away their awfulness. XI For this to cold, unhumble men Is all that vaunted knowledge gives, The raising self by hiding God, The disennobling of our lives. XII The men of Linz see into Heaven, Where sages but detect its law; Judge which the better wisdom is, And who hath holier love and awe. XIII Yea, only lest this barren dream Upon the men of Linz should pass, Were reason they should kneel and pray To Mary and St. Nicholas. CLXIV.THE HEIRESS OF GÖSTING. I Is there a stream on this sweet earth In vale or woodland, where Traditions of unhappy love Breathe not like summer air? II There is no thought to hallow earth With more consoling gladness Than the true comfort she hath given To lovers in their sadness. III Green trees and streams and castled steeps Are sweetest when they move, The gentle forms in stirring songs Of old disastrous love. IV Born of no time or nation, still, In its imperial force, Love with the meekest forms of earth Holds simple intercourse. V Love, like the abbey-building monks, By wood or stream is found: Who ever knew a love-tale haunt A cold, unsightly ground? VI A pilgrim through green Steyermark, The poet now is resting, Soothed by the woodland voice of Mur, Beneath the rock of Gösting. VII Across the river and the mead The cliff's tall shade was thrown, Where sheltered from the sun I sat Upon a rugged stone. VIII A tender tale of luckless love In that sweet gloom had part, And with the shadow of the rock It went into my heart. IX Above were the green battlements Of Gösting's castle strong; I saw it not, but felt it there, A very power of song. X Ah! faith hath wronged thee, gentle tower! Thou wert too fair to shine The bright spot in the legend dark Of hapless Adeline. XI Was ever maid like Adeline In all the Styrian land? Was ever noble stout and wise As old Count Ferdinand? XII Had ever knight a silver tongue His lady's heart to melt, And yet a hand in battle strong, Like Franz of Lilienfeld? XIII Was ever peer in paynim war So merciful and bold, As the young lord of Shackenstein, The black-haired Leopold? XIV Ah! like a pensive summer cloud Their memory floateth by, Far dearer for the shade it casts Than all the bright blue sky. XV E'en in those strong-featured times, When human act and feeling Through all the world with ruder ways And greater forms were dealing, XVI For masculine chivalric love The two young knights were famed, And never in the court or camp Were separately named. XVII And oft to Träusen's earth-lipped stream Came Leopold, a guest, Within the halls of Lilienfeld For many a week to rest. XVIII And when brave Franz returned to stay With Shackenstein's young earl, How short were summer's longest days Within the vale of Thörl! XIX In boyhood when their limbs were first In little mail arrayed, In fashion, colour, and in weight Their suits alike were made. XX Both flashed among the Styrian vales, Like very stars of light, Upon their proud and prancing steeds Of true Hungarian white. XXI In all the Transylvanian wars They shared one board and tent, And shone with fellow scarfs and plumes At foreign tournament. XXII Ah love! were all the lives of men Told truly one by one, The hearts thou hast dealt fairly with, And those thou hast undone, XXIII At what a price of others' griefs, We might with awe behold, Each single hour of happy love On earth is bought or sold! XXIV Two tender hearts along one path Through all the world may move, If they at some fair turn in life Encounter not with love. XXV There is no incense half so sweet Unto the jealous power, As the sad fragrance offered up From friendship's withered flower. XXVI But Franz apart at Lilienfeld, The earl at Shackenstein, Each knew not how the other loved The heiress Adeline. XXVII Count Ferdinand to Hungary On mission high hath gone, And Adeline has to herself The castle huge and lone. XXVIII A lady lone was Adeline Within her river bower, Yet, dreaming of young Leopold, She had no weary hour. XXIX She worked not at her tapestry, Nor on her cithern played, But to her bowerwoman oft The heartsick lady said: XXX “Now do I envy, Marian, That pleasant vale of Thörl, The very rocks and trees that look All day at that young earl. XXXI “And yet,” how pale the lady turned! “He never can be mine, I love with hopeless hidden love, Ah woe is Adeline! XXXII “In all the vales of Steyermark, In rich Carinthia's dells, The love of Franz and Leopold A household wonder dwells. XXXIII “And every maiden loves the pair As though they were her own, And did belong unto the land, The special boast of none. XXXIV “And Franz sits mute at Lilienfeld, And pines for love of me; He is a fair-tongued knight, and yet The earl speaks fair as he. XXXV “I vow, our Lady grant that love My vow may never shake, That Adeline their wondrous bond Shall never, never break. XXXVI “And I for some few weary years Upon this rock will pine, And live and speak with those two knights, And die and make no sign. XXXVII “And, when his heiress droops and dies, The good Count Ferdinand To Mary and St. Kilian May leave his woody land.” XXXVIII This Adeline, the lady lone, Unto her bowermaid said, And she was pale as death itself, And mutely hung her head. XXXIX But hark! two horsemen loudly greet The porter gray and old, And blithe the seneschal replies; 'Tis Franz and Leopold. XL And, privileged intruders! see They part the chestnut bough, And doff their caps to Adeline: Now lady! for thy vow! XLI And pale as death! O ashy pale! But quiet as a queen, The lady from her bower stepped forth With calm and gracious mien. XLII In converse sweet on common things They walked among the flowers; The summer day turned on its hinge With soft and noiseless hours. XLIII Upon the white rose by the rock There grew one blossom fair, Which Franz in idle mirth had said Would suit his long brown hair. XLIV And Adeline from sorrow won, Forgetful of her vow, Stooped down unto the blossom white, And plucked it from the bough. XLV And surely utterly entranced, Yet so the tale is told, She twined it in the raven hair Of her own Leopold. XLVI Franz gazed on her with startled eye, The young earl fondly smiled, And thus the secret of his love Was from his heart beguiled. XLVII O wondrous are the ways of men, And passion's sudden changes, Through which the soul in one short hour With desperate action ranges! XLVIII That smile hath withered years of love: In Franz's burning spirit Ejected love's intensity Dark hatred doth inherit. XLIX Dishonor to the spotless knight Becomes an airy sound; And the red blood of Leopold Hath stained that garden ground. L No scream, no cry from Adeline, But silent as the grave A snowy robe beneath the bridge Floats down the woodland wave. LI Young Franz leaned on his reeking sword, And pitifully gazed Upon the white and ghastly face To the blue sky upraised. LII And, many a year of penance past, He in the vale of Thörl, An anchoret in sackcloth shirt, Was buried near the earl. LIII Then far and wide the tidings spread Unto the Danube's shore; Count Ferdinand from Hungary To Gösting came no more. LIV And Gösting Castle now is left Unto the wild white roses, And not a maid in Styria durst Wreathe one into her posies. LV And daily on the pleasant stream The white leaves fall and shine, And float away beneath the bridge, Symbols of Adeline! CLXV.THE YELLOW-HAMMER. I A yellow-hammer in the rain! And that on this Carinthian plain, So far, so far from home! It fills me with old childish years: And then these happy, happy tears, Do what I will they come! II Behold him now: he never stops, Among the pattering raindrops A blithe distrubance making, Beating for ever on one key, Pleased with his own monotony, And his wet feathers shaking. III What tender memories are bound To this familiar hedge-row sound! The creature's homely glee Associates me with the hours, When, so pure childhood willed, all showers Were sunshine showers to me. IV Away he goes, and hammers still Without a rule but his free will, A little gaudy Elf! And there he is within the rain, And beats and beats his tune again, Quite happy in himself. V Within the heart of this great shower He sits, as in a secret bower, With curtains drawn about him: And, part in duty, part in mirth, He beats, as if upon the earth Rain could not fall without him. VI Ah homely bird! thou canst not know How far into my heart doth go That melancholy key, How from thy little straining throat Each separate, successive note Beats like a pulse in me. VII Through blinding tears meek fancy weaves Far other fields, far other leaves, Than those by Drava's side; For now the looks of long lost faces, And the calm features of old places, Like magic, round me glide. VIII Thou art a power of other days, A voice from old deserted ways Obscured by trackless flowers, An echo of the childish past, Thus touchingly and strangely cast Into these foreign bowers. IX O it was right and well with me When I could love a single tree As a green sanctuary, When I could in the meadow lie And look into the silky sky For hours, and not be weary! X Now over sea and over earth I pass with hollow, heated mirth Which doth but gender sadness, And with uneasy heart I range Through all the pageantry of change To gather moods of gladness. XI Time flies, and life; and manly thought, Into unsunny currents wrought, Is in hoarse eddies wheeling: I am a man of growing wants, And I have many wayward haunts, Haunts both of thought and feeling. XII When joys were simple, days were long, All woven into one bright throng, Like golden bees at play, One with another softly blending, As though they could not have an ending, And all were but one day. XIII I thank thee, gentle bird! for this; Thou hast awakened childish bliss, A sweet monition given; And willing tears for youthful sin Are fragrant rituals, that may win The old light back from Heaven. XIV And sure I am that summer day Ne'er shone on a more grand array Or gorgeous pomp of mountains; And o'er the plain in shining rings The Drave with blithest murmurings Comes from his Alpine fountains: XV And seen through this bright, dazzling rain How fair is yon Carinthian plain, A richly wooded park, Where groups of birch with silver stems Rise up, like sceptres of white gems, Among the fir-clumps dark. XVI Yet am I cast upon lost years; The Present is dissolved in tears; So is this bird empowered; An oracle upon the bough He sits, through him the Present now Is by the Past deflowered. CLXVI.BAMBERG. I There are who blame sensations of delight, Born of our happy strength and cheerful health, As though we could lay by no moral wealth From the pulsations of mere joyous might. II How poor they make themselves who thus disown The fresh and temperate body's right to wait Upon the soul, and to exhilarate The heart with life from animal spirits thrown! III For me a very weight of moral wealth From the bright sun upon the ivy wall, And white clouds in the sky, doth gaily fall, Making my days a thanksgiving for health. IV The whetting of the mower's scythe at morn, The odorous withering of the new-cut grass, Breeding I know not what enjoyment, pass Like a new world into my spirit borne. V O there are harvests from the buoyant mirth Which hath such power my nature to unbind, Letting my spirits flow upon the wind, As though I were resolved into the earth. VI When I have bounded with elastic tread, Or floated, without root, a frolic breeze Waked by the sunlight on the fields or seas, Moods of ripe thought have thence been harvested. VII I stood upon the Michaelsberg; below, Into three cities cloven by the streams, Was ancient Bamberg, and the morning beams Had touched a thousand gables with their glow. VIII Around, a dull expanse, did cornfields shine, The shallow Regnitz and the winding Maine Were coiled in ruddy links upon the plain, And lost beyond the pinewood's hard black line. IX The radiance on the Minster roof was poured, And then above the convent's dusky bowers Sprung all at once the four illumined towers, As though St. Michael had unsheathed his sword. X I thought not, Bamberg! of thy bishops old, The rich Franconian church, or abbots gone To beard the emperor at Ratisbon, With saucy squires and Swabian barons bold. XI But there I stood upon the dizzy edge, And saw a sight worth all the barons bold, A woven web of purple and of gold, A living web thrown o'er the rocky ledge. XII It was a cloud of rooks in morning's beam, Which, rising from the neighbouring convent trees, With all their pinions open to the breeze, Swam down the steep in one majestic stream. XIII It was a purple cataract that flung Its living self adown a rocky rent, And midway in its clamorous descent The rainbow-glancing morning o'er it hung. XIV Some were of gold, which in a moment shifted Into a purple or a brilliant black, And some had silver dewdrops on their back, Changing as through the beams the creatures drifted. XV Beneath, the multitudinous houses lay: The living cataract one instant flashed Through the bright air, then on the roofs was dashed In seeming shower of gold and sable spray. XVI I watched with joy the noisy pageant leap Into the quiet city; and the thrill Of health did so my glowing body fill, That I would fain sail with it down the steep. XVII I was beside myself; I could not think: A beauty is a thing entire, apart, And may be flung into a passive heart, And be a fountain there whence we may drink. XVIII Ah me! the morning was so cool and bright, And I so strong, and it was such a mirth To be so far away upon the earth, That I was overflowed with sheer delight. XIX Away, like stocks and stones, went serious thought, Now buried in the foamy inundation, Now through the waves of exquisite sensation From time to time unto the surface brought. XX I rescued nothing, for I had no power; And in the retrospect I dare to boast,— I would not for a world of thought have lost The animal enjoyment of that hour! CLXVII.THE DAILY TREE. I Queen Mary said that on her heart, Engraven there as with a dart, Transferred by bitter thought, The name of Calais would be found In cypher legible and round, By meditation wrought. II And I believe that through the eye The household forms, which round us lie In sweet and shapely mass, Things daily touched and seen and heard, By sympathetic power transferred, Upon the spirit pass. III In childish days there was to me A yearly vision of the sea; And now within my soul I never cease to see and hear, In wood or mountain, far or near, That estuary roll. IV My mother's voice, from this fair world Withdrawn long years ago, is furled In my retentive ear, And oft by sweet surprises taken, I hear familiar accents waken A startling echo near. V I daily see an old Scotch fir, Of such a beauty as to stir My heart with joyous thrill: My days would scarce be what they are, If that tree were not always there, A shadow soft and still. VI It is a pleasure overnight To think how morning's beams will light Its fan-like summit airy; And sure I am that it must lie Pencilled upon my memory, Moonlit, and visionary. VII There must be pictured on my soul Its ruddy and fantastic bole, Where snaky lights glide down; For fancy frequent vision weaves Among its wiry, blue-green leaves, And quiet plumy crown. VIII And when the breath of evening rocks That ancient tree with harmless shocks, The two birds cradled there, With sea-like murmurs round them, ride, Their vessel anchored on the tide, A sweet, love-mated pair. IX I love thee, reverend old Tree! For thou art verily to me Like some kind household god. What visitations of delight, What aspects mutable and bright, Hast thou not daily showed! X O didst thou grow in sunken dell, Within the sound of abbey-bell, Hard by the cloistered square, Like some illuminated book Would be thy variable look Unto the inmates there. XI I would some monk of olden times Had watched thee from the matin chimes Until the compline rung, And chronicled thy light and shade, In hieroglyphic show displayed, As thy broad branches swung. XII Thou wouldst have been his world, a chaste And sinless record for thy past; And yet a form to fear And meekly think of, as a thing That might its placid umbrage fling Upon his tombstone near. XIII I have seen morning on it fall, And intersect its coronal With silver lines on high, And sunset clothe its giant limb In huge bronze armour, bright and dim In scales alternately. XIV And when around its rugged waist The twilight's roseate air is braced In clasps of amethyst, It were a sceptre most sublime For fabulous kings of olden time, Wielded by giant wrist. XV And oft with transmutation slow Have I beheld the rough stem glow, Red gold without a stain, When diligent wet mists come down And, dripping from the feathery crown, Burnish the bole with rain. XVI And I have seen a weight of snow On its strained branches drooping low, Dividing the dense crown; Like cares from off an old man's heart, All noiselessly the bent boughs part, And the white flakes fall down. XVII And often in the breathless noon, Or else beneath the unclouded moon, It is absorbed on high; But most I love its sable hue Imbedded in the yielding blue Of a translucent sky. XVIII O quiet Image! thou art lent To be a moral incident Each passing day to me, In all I do and all I think A gentle and restraining link,— How much I owe to thee! XIX The wind rose up: our dreary way Through the Bavarian fir-woods lay, Near Rothenburg's old wall; My own memorial fir-tree wrought Deep in my heart, with anxious thought Lest it that night should fall. XX Ye wild north winds! that o'er the length Of moaning heath collect your strength, That noble fir-tree spare, When all the laurel-borders through Your sad triumphal road ye hew, And rend the coppice fair! XXI Be true to its old anchor, Earth! That it may long a moral mirth Within the vale abide! When I am gone I would that ye Should still enjoy that princely tree, Kind Hearts of Ambleside! CLXVIII.TO MY READER. Young Reader! for most surely to the old These loose, uneven thinkings can but seem Unlife-like and unreal as a dream, O! judge not thou that I have been too bold With sacred teaching, or have done it wrong To give fair form or sweetness to my song: Nor be thou wearied with the changeful vision, As though, with laboured and unmeaning skill, I had but rifled fancy at my will, Or held her hidden order in derision. O far from that: these fitful strains keep blending, Poorly yet truly, strivings gained or lost, By one in whom two tempers were contending, Neither of which had yet come uppermost. CLXIX.THE CHERWELL. A DESCRIPTIVE POEM. Sweet inland Brook! which at all hours, Imprisoned in a belt of flowers, Art drawing without song or sound Thy salient springs, for Oxford bound, Was ever lapse so calm as thine, Or water-meadows half so green, Or weeping weeds so long to twine With threads of crystal stream between? Inglorious River! I will be A laureate, self-elect, for thee. The quiet of this uncut field Fit room for minstrel-craft may yield; And with my skiff beneath this bower, Thatched o'er with luscious elder-flower, No sound but my own murmur shall The local silence disenthral, Save when a coot at times may pass Between the blades of milky grass, Or with a momentary splash A rat between the tree-roots dash, Or, drowsy music! sedge-stalks grind On one another in the wind. And thus to make his verse more free The river shall accompany The poet's voice, while up on high To their bright congress in the sky The stars are trooping one by one, Though Chiltern still detains the moon To silver all his chalky side, And o'er that sea of beech-wood ride. O silent Cherwell! once wert thou A minstrel river; thou didst flow Gently as now, but all along Was heard that sweet itinerant song, Which thou hadst learnt in coming down From the rich slope of Helidon, The green-capped hill that overlooks Fair Warwick's deep and shady brooks, And blithe Northampton's meadow-nooks, Tamest of Counties! with a dower Of humblest beauty rich, a power Only by quiet minds obeyed, And by the restless spurned,—scant shade, And ruddy fallow, and mid these Rare meadows, foliage-framed, which please The leisure-loving heart, and line Where the slow-footed rivers shine, Upon whose reedy waters swim The roving sea-birds, on the brim Of flooded Nenna, in a fleet With a golden lustre lit, What time the short autumnal day Sets o'er the tower of Fotheringay. Not with the wild and echoing mountains, Helvellyn's lone cloud-suckled fountains, Or Langdale's trickling cliffs, or wells, Heath-hidden, on Blencathra's fells, Claimest thou kindred; simple birth Art thou, a thing of common earth! A spot more verdant than the rest Discerned upon the hoof-marked breast Of modest pasture, mid the haunts Of men and cattle, to their wants Endeared,—there was thy cradle laid And not unsoothed by music, made In the clear spring, a prelude sweet To the artful strains and tinkling falls Wherewith thy swollen streams should greet Fair Isis under Oxford's walls. Thence wert thou known to steer thy flood To pierce the mead and thread the wood, And there with curious curves to search The screens of elm for every church, Whose leaded roof and stunted tower Might lurk in some unthought-of bower. And thither didst thou wander down To lean thine ear in many a pool, Cinctured as with a mural crown Of jewelled tansey, rank and cool, Where trailing sprays of eglantine Flung from the hawthorn bushes twine, Taking fresh root beneath our feet Amid the plumy meadow-sweet: While summer shepherded the flocks And starry herds of lady-smocks. There, when the rustic folk were maying, Wert thou with right good-will delaying, Until “the deep and solemn rings,” “Famous ring of bells in Oxfordshire, called the Crossring.” Note to Drayton's Polyolbion, Song XV., where “lusty Cherwell” is represented as a “curious maker,” who sang the praises of the rivers at the nuptials of Thame and Isis. Should time anew thy vocal springs, And they rehearse the borrowed song In every meadow all along Till thou shouldst mate thy breezy swells With the full peal of Oxford bells. Yes—thou wert tuneful once: that day Be witness, when the rivers lay To their own praises proudly listening, And Chiltern's son, the boyish Thame, To wed the Lady Isis came, With his white marly waters glistening. Thou sang'st the bridal hymn, and all, The nimble Churn with sliding fall, The linkèd streams of Coln and Leech, And Yenload's darkling forest-reach, And Windrush, and all Cotswold springs, Praised thee with blithest murmurings, Praised thee and thy most tuneful air, From flowery-meadowed Cisseter, To where the tower of Iffley looks Intent on Bagley's greenwood nooks. Then wherefore do thy waters sleep In these hushed meadows buried deep, With lapse that scarce can stir the sedge And irises upon thine edge? Ah me! perchance the face of war, Here seen long years ago, might scare The pastoral powers and tuneful brood Who nightly from the reedy flood Breathed songlike whispers in the ear Of Saxon hind belated near. Thus o'er the earth are gentle things By rude things here and there displaced, While faith with kind reluctance clings To vestiges well-night effaced. 'Twas strange the pomp of martial guards Should vex thy green sequestered fords, And brawling watchwords come and go Where now thy summer currents flow, And the old willow's bushy top O'ershadows yon hoof-printed slope, And twice an hour perchance, or less, The swaying hay-carts, as they press Through the deep stream and sinking road, Pay tithe from out their odorous load, Above unto the willow-bough, And to the gliding stream below. Still art thou mindful of the day When Charles beheld the disarray Of rebel foes upon the ridge That swells behind Cropredy Bridge, And parted streaks of crimson blood Profaned the hayfields and the flood. It was St. Peter's feast in June, A day of fragrant rain: at noon, Unbonneted and free, the king Dined where a lusty ash did fling A chequered shade upon the ground, While the wet grass still sparkled round. Yet, ere the querulous chimes rang three Within the streets of Banbury, Cleveland beneath the selfsame ash Stood forth, and bade his horsemen dash In angry charge upon the foe Who thronged the Cherwell banks below. Enough, meek Stream! I will not wake Thoughts of rude triumph here, nor break The sylvan peace that suits so well The spirit of the local spell. Sweet, Cherwell! are thy hawthorn tents Fit havens for my summer boat, And fair the lily-isles which float, The stream's most touching incidents. Gay regions are they, stretching o'er A gleamy breadth, from shore to shore, From off the shelving turf projecting, Of broad-lipped leaves compact and bright, With threads of water intersecting The flats of green embossed with white; And stripes of yellow nuphar, drawn In random lines across the lawn, Intrude their rows of golden wedges, Parting the fairy realm, like hedges, To shires and baronies, whereon Are set a court and garrison Of ladybirds and brilliant flies In green and gilded panoplies. There have I watched the downy coot Pacing with safe and steady foot The surface of the floating field, And, though the elastic floor might yield In chinks, and let the water flow In beads of crystal from below, Yet was the tremulous region true To that rough traveller passing through. But, as a buoyant vision, breathed From the poetic spirit, wreathed In chastely blending hues, and wrought With the strong tissue of rich thought, Fades off before the cheerless gaze Of cold and unimpassioned praise, Yet cannot perish, but each hour Is wooed into its place once more By feeling hearts, o'er all the earth Dwelling apart; so this sweet birth, This meek and delicate creation, From the calm, fertile stream outpoured, Sinks like a graceful exhalation, To be by genial spring restored, Frail yet immortal, dying ever, And ever born within the river, A summer pageant, gay and fleeting, Robed like a bride in vivid white, Dispersed and broken by the greeting Of the first keen autumnal night. In flowery May or shady June Oft have I spent a vacant noon In Cherwell's matted hawthorn bowers Or coves of elder, while the hours In deep sensations of delight Sped past me with the silent might Of time unnoted, which for ever Sweeps onward like a voiceless river; And now and then a most sweet thought Or outward beauty in me wrought With such blithe trouble as to bring The noontide's pleasant lingering Most sensibly unto me: these, Like the soft shaking of a breeze, The pulse of summer in the trees, Were my sole hours, my notes of time, Joy striking joy, an inward chime Of silent song, yet not the less All resonant with cheerfulness. There, stretched at lazy length, I read, With boughs of blossom overhead, And here and there the liquid blue Of the smooth sky was melting through. In tranquil parties o'er the field, To gain what shade the boughs might yield, The sheep were clustered in a ring Beneath each hawthorn's fragrant wing: Only they did not seek to share The ample screen where I was laid, Though I was fain they should repair At peace with me to that broad shade, That in mute converse with the creatures, And gazing on their patient features, I might recover some sweet sense Of our original innocence; But in the light of human eyes Their guided instincts recognise Sin's presence, and in sacred fear Though unalarmed, they come not near. There—ah! 'tis years since—did I pore The old Greek idylls o'er and o'er, Creating nooks of freshest green By mild sea-bays, the fancied scene Of those bright pastorals: but in sooth They were less lovely than the truth, Less lovely than the spots of lawn Where I have mused in Greece, withdrawn From all intrusion, the gay shock Of childish voices, or the flock Threading the cliff with plaintive bleating, Or the wild goat's more gamesome greeting, And where no sound but one could be, The drowsy echo of the sea, With scarce a wave upon its breast Enough to rock a babe to rest. Mid arbutus and gaunt stone-pine The polished shafts of lentisk shine, With braided boughs of cytisus, And under-growths most odorous Of true Greek thyme with pale pink eyes:— Ah! many spots to memory rise, Where beauty made the desolation Tenfold more sad, a reparation, So seemed it, of a tender sort By nature offered, to support Earth worn and weary with the wrong Which sin hath wrought on her so long: Thus gently pleading the defence Of her mute scenes, to recompense Her patient solitudes, intent Thereby to set within our reach This touching truth which it would teach,— Man sins, but earth is innocent! Thus oft upon the bank I lay, In dreams begetting many a bay Of desert Greece, to localize Some idyll, while with still surprise The modest, calm realities Stole softly through my half-closed eye, The native river gliding by, The cradled lily's nodding flowers, And Oxford's hazy line of towers, The willow twinkling in the breeze, The incense of the elder trees What time the heats of noonday wooed The bright and fragrant solitude, Gentle recalls to summon back My wanton heart, as though for lack Of native beauty I had sought For scenes which only live in thought, And earth in plaintive answer brought The sweet vicinity to mind With gentlest urgency,—confined, Yet oh how beautiful! Each token, Like soft reproaches but half-spoken By those we love, with eloquence Mutely appealed to every sense Against my dreamy landscapes; there The brilliant texture of the air, Clothing each form in purest white, Filled to the brim that exquisite Satiety of ear and eye Which deep mid-summer can supply, Just ere the autumnal gold invades The twilight of her leafy shades. There time set gently upon me In tides of placid reverie, With scarce a murmur of sweet verse, And scarce a mood which could immerse My heart in solemn thought, soft streams Of most unfertile beauty, dreams Of indolent delight. Alas! Smoothly as summer seemed to pass, Detached from every haunt of sin While all was sunny peace within, It was not innocent: for time Hath functions awful and sublime, And on its viewless lapse are traced Stern chronicles of all the past, A writing every sunset laid, While heaven is still, within the shade Of Christ's high Throne, one day to be A part of the solemnity And pomp of Judgment: endless Woe Or endless Weal! to some a show Of fiery cyphers, symbols dread Of guilty things unpardonèd, Of wilful ways and idle mirth Unloosed by Holy Church on earth. And some there are to whom that scroll, Sad record still, may yet unroll A fairer vision, dark and bright, Like dawn o'er-mastering tardy night In dubious streaks, with here and there A firm and radiant character To angel's eyes not new, but known And recognised the Judge's Own. O Time! O Life! ye were not made For languid dreaming in the shade, Nor sinful hearts to moor all day By lily-isle or grassy bay, Nor drink at noon-tide's balmy hours Sweet opiates from the meadow-flowers. O give me grace, dear Lord! to win Thy pardon for my youthful sin, For all the days, in woods embowered, When currents of soft thought o'erpowered With pleasant force the sense of duty,— And gentle nature's harmless beauty, Too much adored, gave birth to throngs Of joys effeminate, and songs Which sprung from earth, and like a breeze Died wantonly among the trees, Without a moral or a mirth Above the passing bliss of earth! But now doth evening's pensive wing Less of misleading beauty bring, And clothes insensibly the scene With sweeter, but more sober, green. The pageant of the noon gives place To evening's tenderness, a grace As soft, nay softer, and more holy, And with some tinge of melancholy Endeared and chastened, and a balm Of palpable and breathing calm By songs of birds confessed, and flowers That wave more gaily in their bowers, And gentle kine that graze once more Spotting the misty pastures o'er, And flocks of rooks that settle down Upon the elms which gird the town. And see the sun! How well he sets Behind those triple minarets Of silent poplar! All is still, But that one thrush upon the hill: And now and then a flight of wind The glassy current will unbind, Driving the ripples to the edge Among the spikes of rustling sedge. Now evening lends her rosy hue With liquid colors to bedew The hoary stone and chapel gray Where Austin's monks were wont to pray. And strangely in the crimson west Doth Atlas seem awhile to rest On the star-gazing tower, The figures (for I believe there is more than one) that support the globe on the Observatory, viewed from Cherwell, which lies to the east, have the effect of a single figure, seen in relief against the sun setting over Cumnor or Whyteham. where he For years hath stooped full wearily Bearing the world, in patient sign That He who bears it is divine And yet true Man;—and in the heart Of many sunsets hath had part, Prompting that lesson to mine eye, While pictured on the glowing sky In dark colossal effigy. O many an evening have I been Entranced upon that glorious scene, When silent thought hath proved too strong For utterance in tranquil song. There intermingling with the trees The city rose in terraces Of radiant buildings, backed with towers And dusky folds of elm-tree bowers. St. Mary's watchmen, mute and old, Each rooted to a buttress bold, From out their lofty niche looked down Upon the calm monastic town, Upon the single glistering dome, And princely Wykeham's convent home, And the twin minarets that spring Like buoyant arrows taking wing, And square in Moorish fashion wrought As though from old Granada brought, And that famed street, whose goodly show In double crescent lies below, And Bodley's court, and chestnut bower That overhangs the garden wall, And sheds all day white flakes of flower From off its quiet coronal. Methinks I see it at this hour,— How silently the blossoms fall! Strange scene it is which they behold, Those watchmen on St. Mary's pile, Who see the noiseless moonlight smile On spires and pinnacles untold, Whose ranks may baffle every eye That vainly would their number know, And roofs which rear the Cross on high In grave and monitory show:— Strange scene it is which mortal gaze But rarely mounts on high to praise, A region where for ever dwells The tremulous throbbing of the bells, Encircling every turret there With close embrace of tuneful air, While oft the very stones respire With the deep anthems of the choir,— A world above our world, a ground Thus tenanted by form and sound, A costly region, day and night Laid open to angelic sight! There, mid the shade scarce visible, The suburb of the Holy Well With low-browed Church doth seem to guard The ancient city's northern ward; And barely might the eye discover, Through the green umbrage stooping over, The battlemented wall that bounds The mitred Waynfleet's sumptuous grounds, The sweet-brier court and cloistered way And mimic glade where deer may stray, And the two sunny angles where The almond and the cypress are, And, graceful three! those brother trees That meet and part with every breeze, The birch that weeps upon the sward, Yet with the plane-tree serves to guard The light acacia's fluttering shade In pearly pendents all arrayed. And in the meadow-island there As to the breeze the willows bare Their silver sides, and wave about, The practised eye may then find out, Close-hidden, when the wind is still, The weedy roof of Magdalen mill. But now the leaves are darker grown, And o'er the fields a shade is thrown Of soft transparent gloom: the stream Shines with subdued but stedfast gleam Through the dusk veil of twilight air, And the white lilies waver there, Like distant lights borne up and down In anchored ship or midnight town. The stars are clear and strong, but soon The light of the unrisen moon With soft infusion through the sky Mingles apace, and up on high The stars wax dim, while purple night, Thus weakened by the stealthy light, Translucent grows as crystal bay Of Midland Sea on summer day. But now above the willow tops That cluster there, a silvery copse Which doth an earthy pool infold, With prow and stern of ruddy gold The crescent lifts itself, to ride With Hesperus sparkling at its side Almost in contact, night by night Divided more and more, a slight Yet mournful sign, as though it were That in the worlds of upper air Rude separations still might come To souls in their eternal home. But though our heart such vision grieves, And though it visibly bereaves The evenings of their special grace, Yet had we but the gift to trace The wisdom of the starry sky, No gloomy types would meet our eye, And to the signs so sweetly wrought, By moon and stars, there should be nought But kind interpretations given; For there are no farewells in heaven. Behold! as night succeeds to eve, The owls with sombre plumage leave Their cloisters in the hollow trees, And shed sad voices on the breeze All up the moonlit vale. The dew Falls on the flowers which shed anew Their simple fragrance: and the river Far off in many a reach doth quiver, Outstretching like a lucid creature, Appearing scarce an earthly feature Upon the nightly landscape, here Embraced within some thicket near In calm obscurity, and there Emerging to the radiant air, A coiled and gleamy flickering line Among the meadows serpentine, Broken by intervening boughs Through which the lovely crescent glows Upon the dimpled waters. Sweet The wandering poet's eye to meet Are quiet fields by moonlight seen With groups of white, recumbent sheep, Where elm-cast shadows dimly green On the dew-beaded pasture sleep. But now awhile on vale and hill The loveliness of night is still; The beautiful mutations stop On field and stream and dark tree-top, Only the shadows somewhat shift, And the bright stars a little drift Across the sloping sky: so slow The moving pageant seems to go We might believe that for some cause The spheres at midnight made a pause, And heaven and earth in awe sublime Stayed to receive new grants of time, And new permissions to delight The race of men with day and night. Now in the east there is a stir Of powers that wait to minister Unto the sunrise, and a blooming Prophetic of his far-off coming. The sluggish spires of chilly steam Are twisting o'er the silent stream, And from the willow-grounds are breathing, And round the haycocks slowly wreathing, Until they stand, each side by side, Within the vapor magnified, Like dim and visionary things Seen through the smoke of magic rings. The air is waxing bright and chill, Though yet the doubtful lark is still; And in the whitening sky the trees Grow black and keen as day is breaking, While here and there a creeping breeze The huge dew-laden boughs is shaking. And see! St. Mary's vane aloft Glows like a star serene and soft, And doth with secret influence reach The sun whose rising it doth preach; As holy Church will once descry, By power of her ascetic eye, The Advent of her Bridegroom nigh. So have I dreamed with pure delight A visionary day and night On Cherwell's banks: thus song could stir In me a willing minister To my sick brother. With a tear I left behind the crystal mere, Deep summer out upon the hills, The dusky deans, the cool-breathed rills, And, shaded in the tender gloom And silentness of his sick room, Hour after hour brought o'er my sense A most pathetic influence. The careful step, the voice subdued My heart with meek advances wooed To softer images; while nigh, Beneath the window, glided by The earthy Cherwell, strangely shrunk So long had thirsty summer drunk Of its spare stream. And up the river, I watched the radiant network quiver Beneath the bridge; and oft there came, Swift as a meteor's shooting flame, A king-fisher from out the brake, And almost seemed to leave a wake Of brilliant hues behind; and couched On the close sward the deer had slouched Their heads, and watched the currents pass, While ears and antlers in the grass With restless movement twinkled. There The elm swung lightly on the air, And many a fickle willow drooped, While the laborious current scooped The moist earth from its roots, and wore A deep beneath the o'erhanging shore, A summer refuge alway cool, Where in the dark sequestered pool Among the fibres of the tree The curious eye may often see A little crew of silver dace Self-prisoned in that shadowy place. And sheets of lawn with verdant brows Just glimmered through the veil of boughs. Or in the sloping sunset twinkled Like a smooth golden lake breeze-wrinkled,— A long broad lake of meadow-grass, Where winds and slanting sunbeams pass, And intershot with gold and green In fluted lines with rows between Of gilded field-flowers that appear Like ripples on a crystal mere; And that fair land-lake stiller lies And better wins the wandering eyes To fixed delight, than if the face Of silent waters filled the place. And nightly up the watery glade By stealth the russet autumn strayed, While here and there a leaf was seen Forswearing summer's darksome green, And every day a gem or two Were freshly braided on the yew, And yet so slowly it might seem The wayward eye did rather dream, If poet's eye could e'er misread The least of nature's signs, which feed His simple heart. And haunted so, Watching the Cherwell daily flow, I sang of him, his fields and flowers, The transmutations of the hours, The tranquil day, the starry night, The alternations of delight, Which on this simple river shower Methinks a more than common dower Of placid beauty: and meanwhile, Though every form without did smile, My tender office hourly wrought A shade to blend with sunny thought, And the sick-room itself could bring Somewhat of pensive hallowing For fancy's chastisement. Sweet Stream! O mayst thou be a cheering gleam Long unwithdrawn; and when oppressed By a sick spirit's sad unrest, May nature's forms a fountain prove For faith unfailing, and a love That breeds submission! May they bear, It is no light unworthy prayer, Such pure and blameless joy to me, When I shall disenfranchised be, Of rough heathside and open air! And better still if I could lie Waiting for death,—and azure sky, Cool forest, and the keen-breathed hill, And freshening sounds of dashing rill, The long-loved cuckoo's woodland call, And the wildness of the waterfall, And holy ocean's solemn shore,— Might be uncoveted, nay more, All unremembered, and mine ear Be deaf to those kind neighbors near Who speak of sun and fields and air And garden flowers, as though they were A part of me, or they could be Where I am then,—on Calvary, A flowerless mountain, where the Cross My patient thoughts may well engross. And better still if I could dare To pray the Saint's exclusive prayer, And with bold fervor ask of Heaven More thorns and griefs than it hath given. So might I lie, in love with pain, And, like a miser with his gain, Handle the aching limb, to feel More palpably how pangs can heal Sin's wounds, and how beyond all price The sweetness of self-sacrifice, And what strange pleasures pain may bring As being a holy Christlike thing, And the repentant soul how still Beneath the weight of God's sweet Will. So might I lie, in saintly strait S. Theresa. Pati et mori. S. Mary Magdalen of Pazzi. Patire e non morire. The latter Saint on her death-bed uttered these remarkable words:—Sappiate che l'esercitio del patire è cosa tanto pregiata e nobile, che il Verbo trovandosi nel Seno del suo eterno Padre, abbondantissimo di ricchezze e delitie di Paradiso, perche non era ornato della stola del patire, venne in terra per questo ornamento, e questo era Dio, che non si potea ingannare. They arose perhaps from a confused remembrance in her mind of a wonderful passage in the eleventh chapter of Tauler's Institutes. Whether to sue for death or wait That I might suffer more, and bear The Cross a little further, dare A little more to match the Road Of Dolours which our Saviour trod. So might I lie, in peace how deep! So, like an infant, fall asleep, While suffering cradled me to rest, Like Jesus, at our Lady's breast. CLXX.ON THE RAMPARTS AT ANGOULEME. Why art thou speechless, O thou setting Sun? Speak to this earth, speak to this listening scene Where Charente flows among the meadows green, And in his gilded waters, one by one, The inverted minarets of poplar quake With expectation, until thou shalt break The intolerable silence. See! he sinks Without a word; and his ensanguined bier Is vacant in the west, while far and near Behold! each coward shadow eastward shrinks. Thou dost not strive, O Sun, nor dost thou cry Amid thy cloud-built streets; but meek and still Thou dost the type of Jesus best fulfil, A noiseless revelation in the sky. CLXXI.THE OLD FRENCH TELEGRAPHS. I On many a treeless knoll and lofty church, Or on the unsteady fabric of a keep More than half ruined, or a natural steep, These wizard ministers of science perch, Like some dark birds that for awhile alight, To dress their pinions for a longer flight. For such against the cloudless azure seem Their long black fans, now raised as if to soar, Now slowly furled as though the flight were o'er: Mute, mute and busy, even like a dream, Telling a stirring tale, and yet as still As the sweet stars, or with a murmuring Soft as the wafture of a stockdove's wing, Or breeze that chafes the poplars on the hill. II What though it write its ciphers on the sky, With graceless gesture, yet that wondrous Hand, Waving from steep to tower across the land, Annulling space, apt symbol may supply To clothe grave thoughts withal: from Calais gate To old Bayonne, from Alps to Pyrenees, Yon silent words outstrip the wind, and freight The slanting sunbeam with their messages. Such are the signals, beckoning night and day Through the wide camp of Angels that essay Even now this glorious kingdom to recast With patient art in faith's magnificent mould, To make it saintly as the France of old, And rivet once again its broken past. III God speed the blissful work, thou famous land! And do not thou the unearthly change reprove; Since He, who left thee with reluctant love To thine own ways, again puts forth His Hand. O France! all license gained is but a loss Of liberty; and thou wert then most free When thou wert proud, with blameless pride, to be Nought but the foremost vassal of the Cross. Is it the Midland Sea, or do I hear Celestial converse in the olives near? “Our task is half complete: the Civil Power, Outworn with ills which it hath overcome, Falls back upon the Holy Church, and Rome In trembling expectation waits the hour!” CLXXII.CONSTANTINOPLE, OR NEW ROME. FROM THE HILL ABOVE THE MOSQUE OF EYOUB. I Sweet-breathing May is on the Golden Horn, And that can be no star which I behold Fixed in the cloudless noon, a spot of gold Bright as the single orb which doth adorn The rosy flush of morn. O that it were an emblem half so chaste, Or one which to a Christian stranger's eye Read no reproachful comment on the past! See, how it shines, how starlike up on high In its tranquillity! It is the prophet's Crescent mutely gleaming, And far across the blue Propontis streaming From St. Sophia's stately cupola; And I, all wrapped in melancholy dreaming, In spite of sunny May, Could weep the hours away For ages past, which to my vision rise With solemn pomp of bitter memories. II Here, in sweet Eyoub, May's scent-laden breath Steals through the cypress vistas faint and cool, And gathered round me are the beautiful And soothing sights of this voluptuous faith, Veiling the woe of death. The minarets with gleamy shafts repose Within the green embraces of a plane, Whose lower boughs a very realm of rose With countless links of flower doth interchain, And mounting blends again With pendent bowers of quince, all blossoming, White as a snow-wreath in the eye of spring, Whose lithe twigs trail in fringes on the ground; And flights of sacred pigeons on the wing, And turtles heard all round, As though a natural sound From the sad cypress breathed, my fancy wooed, A paradise of earthly solitude. III See, how the cypress fastens on the steep With its red starting roots, and slanting throws Its sable spires in endless leaning rows, Just tremulously stirred when breezes creep By fits from off the deep! The pointed arch, the floor of withered leaves, The architecture of the sombre glade, The nightingale doth claim; and there he grieves, Well pleased to have that night-by-day, the shade Perpetually made By the dusk foliage for his shrinking eye; And there he dwells, renouncing the blue sky For ever, and with mournful heart beguiles His penitence of life-long melody; And in the shadowy aisles The sun though green mists smiles, Save when the wind may part the graceful plumes, For eve to gild the turban-headed tombs. IV Not weary is the weight of sober thought, When we can read in nature's genial eye An answer to our own solemnity, And all the images around, untaught By our own mood, are fraught With an inherent sadness. Yet, oh never Was there a spot on earth where melancholy Should be more sued with purpose and endeavour And greedy welcome, or should be more wholly A growth of nature, solely And deeply spiritual, than the glooms Of these cool leafy crypts, whose airy plumes Speak low as if endued with some dim sense Of what they symbolize! There, mid the tombs I lie, and viewed from thence, In contrast most intense, Doth the poor desecrated city seem All beautiful and clear as childhood's dream. V Not the soft transit of a summer cloud Doth interrupt that eastern show: the sea Reflects the unstained heaven, and airs are free To bend the falling fountains in the proud And jealous screens that shroud The mosque's refulgent domes; and in the limes, Which gird Suleiman's cloister, from his cell The stockdove emulates the lisping chimes Of the Propontid breeze, or rustling swell Born of the invisible And restless spirit of the Euxine. There The sweet creation, innocently fair, In nought doth its magnificent office miss: The blessing circulates through sea and air, And the original bliss Of earth unfettered is; Yet o'er the heart a humbling shade is cast, While thought confronts the present with the past. VI A ceremonial comes! Before mine eye A twin procession through the tombs doth press, With angel pursuivants, in silentness. Slowly the phantom-pageant glimmers by, The twofold destiny, Dimly impersonated, of old Rome, Mother and mistress of the western world, And this fair city, Constantine's new home, A Christian vision suddenly unfurled When the false gods were hurled From their foul thrones. See how the figures climb The hill of Eyoub in array sublime, And yet with difficult slowness, like the old, Laic or priestly, who at holy time Are fain to be enrolled In some procession, bold In heart, but soon heat-stricken left and weary Outside the portal of the sanctuary. VII So seemed those destinies but half fulfilled, For each in working out its doom had faltered, And, once again renewed, had swerved, and altered The orbit wherein God its mission willed; And each methought had spilled Somewhat of the quick life which had been given Unto them for an instinct, oft impelling Their awful fortunes, like the Hand of Heaven, Across the unwilling earth,—a strange indwelling Mysteriously swelling Through the tumultuous records of the past: In more than mortal mould their deeds were cast, Cities anointed to a singular doom And in a special law of fate embraced: Yet, ah! thou, pagan Rome, And thou, bright eastern home! Ye both have failed, world-stricken left and weary, Short of the ends which were your sanctuary. VIII If we believe no more than what we see, How undivine is earth! If to the sense There be no seams of mighty Providence, No lucid furrows by some past decree Worn on the land or sea, Is not the world a cipher we have lost? Nay, rather let us in her cities kneel, Pilgrims not idly borne from coast to coast, And kiss the footprints of the Invisible, Which haply we may spell In vision true, inscriptions half effaced, Where with His Church in ancient times He passed; And let us sink in adoration down Before the dark prophetic shadows cast On destined field or town,— Through sin there earthward thrown, Here for awhile drawn backward at the prayer Of the weak saints who thrones and states upbear. IX Hail, mighty Rome, that in the panoply Of thy past greatness still art bravely clad! Slowly didst thou emerge from out the shade, Till thou hadst filled the terror-stricken eye Of wide humanity: Yet not from the majestic heathen ruin Of thy first self couldst thou e'er extricate Thy second life: for there was no undoing The yet unsated curse which doth await Thy lingering secular State; Albeit Christ's Holy Church, upon thy hill A sojourner, detains a blessing still, And woos the impending wrath awhile to pause. Dread city! yet she doth but half fulfil Her office, while she draws By mediæval laws The Church and World augustly into one, And, for men's sins, leaves the grand work undone. X See this fair birth of British Constantine, Which, like a sweet disdainful vision, loth To brook the tardy pace of common growth, Sprang from the shore, even as a quivering line Of sudden lamps doth shine Upon a festal night! And there advanced, The very outpost of the Christian East, Like a memorial beacon-fire it glanced Through the vexed ages, till the light decreased Slowly from less to least. A sign might this uncradled city be Of the new power and virgin unity, Wherewith the founder hoped to recement The fissures in the outworn majesty Of ancient Rome, intent To make that element A trick of State: there! see the type unfurled! The Church brooks no alliance with the world. XI Ah, how the past is crowding on mine eyes; A stirring maze with nodding figures blent, Like rings uncleared before the tournament! Through all the streets I hear the midnight cry, When Arius from on high Was struck; and down into the cypress gloom, Hailing the mystic colors, strangely fall The fourfold clamors of the Hippodrome: And with wild surge outside yon bulging wall The Latin armies call For entrance: and amazed I hear the clash, And see the foamy war-horse madly dash Across the pavement, like a mirror, lying Around the altar, and the lamplights flash Upon the virgins flying, And the rude conqueror crying “For God and Mahomet,” while at the word Sophia's Angel sheathes his guardian sword. XII O scene thrice beautiful! the tier on tier Of mulberry-tinted houses by the spires Of cypress intersected, and the fires Of countless crescents topped, while, like a mere, The blue sea murmurs near. O'er terrace, tower, and gleamy-roofed kiosk A dipping cloud of foliage lightly swings, And on that cypress thicket by the mosque The royal fleet its crimson pennants flings, Like magic blossomings Wooed from the sombre trees by sunny May. The fair Seraglio Point appears to sway, Like a trim galley, at her anchorage Between two seas. Ah me! on such a day From out the bright mirage We scarce can disengage Sunshine and shadow, doubtful if it be True city or an eastern phantasy. XIII There is in this fair spot a Turkish faith, Which prophesies, though in its own despite, And is unto my wandering hopes a light,— That they with calmer grace can bow to death, Secure to lie beneath The hallowed soil of Asian Scutari: Europe, to whose impatient skirts they cling, Once more a bodily Christendom shall be, And on the Bosphorus shall sweet bells ring With ancient welcoming. Like faith is mine; though on the flowery steeps, By oath detained, Sophia's Angel weeps O'er the imperial city's demon-trance; Yet his kind, prescient vigil there he keeps, And with unruffled glance Looks o'er the dim expanse Of Euxine, where the vast prophetic scroll The patient North doth visibly unroll! CLXXIII.A COLD DAY IN MAY. I Spring ebbed into the lakes and streams, Or to the earth's warm heart; And stalk and leaf, as with a dart, Were pierced by winter's backward gleams; O May! O treacherous May! these months are very dreams. II The clattering winds above me rolled, Like chariots in a flight; The sky was veined with blue and white, With here and there some cheerless gold; The very brightness was no joy, it was so cold. III But ah! with those true southern eyes And olive-shaded brow, Beneath the half-clothed linden bough, A boy begins his melodies: And now I live and breathe in pure Italian skies. IV How vine-like is yon eglantine! How genial grows the day! And see! up Rothay's gleaming way How sweetly Arno's waters shine; And thou, dear Fairfield! art a well-known Apennine! V Thus cold is manhood's summer day; And grace perchance may be In part the blissful memory Of Christian childhood's marvellous ray, Ere the bad world had scared celestial sights away. VI Our penance, then, doth but retrace A former road; we see The scenes reversed, and, it may be, Dim through our tears; and what is grace But Heaven's lost song on earth, most sweetly out of place? CLXXIV.THE FOUR GOSPELS. I was in vision in a drear old place, Where bodied and unbodied voices ranged, And where the outward semblance hourly changed From a huge vacant minster, to the face Of a lone valley mid the rock-strewn hills; And now it was the wind within the nave Which spoke to me, and now the murmuring wave, Catching the boughs that drooped upon the rills: Yet, whether it were mountain-vale, or shrine By cheerful ordinance untenanted, The vision was but single, and outspread In various unity like things divine. And though its pictured forms and mystic tongue Were strange to me, and though my barren sense Was all unwrought to such intelligence By stern ascetic life, yet while it sung, Pouring forth strains of sweetness too profound To be an earth-born song, my spirit drunk Deep of the fertile waters till they sunk Within my heart, and for a season drowned The world and sin! Ah me! I feel them now, Waking with strength refreshed from that short sleep: So will I strive once more my soul to steep In that wild song, and with the prophet go, Not unalarmed, by Chobar's radiant banks, And, kneeling far aloof in reverent fear, In spirit bid the holy man go near, And softly sing what of cherubic ranks He haply may behold, where o'er his head— O Lord, that I had faith that sight to see, Which o'er my head this hour I know to be!— The inner Heavens are visibly outspread. But hark! the song begins, while to the north The priestly bard, o'er dim Chaldean plains And misty brooks, his eye of rapture strains, And lo! a cloudy whirlwind driving forth! He sings! he sings! how by the river side From out the self-infolding Cloud there came An amber brightness, wings and wheels of flame, And Four mysterious creatures, many-eyed, With lamps that ran forth from them and returned; As when the clouds are every moment riven, Then seem to catch their flashes back to heaven, Even so the lightnings of that vision burned; And underneath their wings, but half concealed, A human hand was resting, which might seem To give sweet right to draw that waking dream Unto ourselves, as though there were revealed Therein the fortunes of our fallen race, And what great things might haply yet be ours, More than retrieving Eden's perished bowers, With Four fresh streams of more than Eden's grace. CLXXV.THE CHURCH DIAL. I Beneath me was the misty sea, O'er which a beetling summit hung, And, half way up, a blasted tree With creaking branches swung: The yellow crowsfoot blossomed there, And juicy samphire to the bare And lean rock clung. II And sweetly to the very edge The soft and thymy greensward crept, And, hanging slightly o'er the ledge, Perpetually wept With drippings from a hidden spring, Heard only when the murmuring Of ocean slept. III There, almost stooping o'er the wave, A rustic chapel stood; below The sea had hollowed out a cave With labour long and slow; And it was plain that any shock That church from off its brow of rock Might overthrow. IV And many a simple heart would grieve At this rude sacrilege of time, Who loved for prayer, at morn or eve, The chalky downs to climb, While to their litanies the wave, With its eternal thunder, gave Response sublime. V So plaintively the soft sea wailed, So blue and breezy were the skies, So tranquilly the white ships sailed In pomp before my eyes, The very sweetness of it all Did there my willing spirit call To moralize. VI The dial on the chapel side With ivy tendrils was entwined, As though the flight of time to hide Were office true and kind; While, on the breath of ocean borne, The restless shoots in playful scorn Waved unconfined. VII This incident, the quiet hour, The sanctity of that lone place, Conspired to give the sight a power Of true pathetic grace; And, as I gazed on it, methought That somewhat of a sign was wrought For me to trace. VIII For I interpreted the gesture, To illustrate how holy faith Was the pure soul's unfading vesture, The Saint's immortal wreath; And, with significance sublime, It taught how faith abolished time By killing death. IX Mute preacher! pensive evergreen! O may I learn, this day, from thee, The obscure sage of this lone scene Hard by the mighty sea, How faith may, through Another's merit, For all the sons of time inherit Eternity! CLXXVI.TO THE ROTHAY WHEN ITS COURSE WAS CHANGED, AND THE WRITER WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD Psalm xxxvi. 5. Commit thy way to the Lord, and trust in Him, and He will do it. Gentle Stream, that from the mountains Here invokest many a rill, While two lakes thy channel fill, Lading from their own sweet fountains Waters which for thee they hoard, In softly throbbing pulses poured! Gentle Stream! I mourn for thee, And the pleasant liberty Guiding once thy twinkling feet Down the vale in measures fleet And mazy circuits; all is o'er, Thou must wander forth no more, Compassing the meadow-lands With silver links and watery bands, Quickening noonday's loitering breeze Languid grown mid sweetnesses Of drowsy flowers, or by the trees In the solid summer shade A silent captive haply made. All is o'er; thy various strain Never shall be heard again, Mimicking old ocean's shock Against some puny cape of rock, Chanting here from side to side, There by lisping boughs supplied With a tremulous response When thou dost thy waves ensconce In pools unruffled, deep and still, Where thou hast gnawed into the hill Hollow chambers mouldering ever With soft splash into the river, Unless the damp their sides emboss With green ligaments of moss. All is o'er; a channel rude Straight among the rocks they hewed, Walls along the banks they led, And, by trenching deep thy bed, Bade the hurrying stream absorb Peaceful bays where many an orb Of silent star was sweetly glassed In the moonless midnights passed. And with expectation vain Couched upon yon marshy plain, Oft the valley's ear hath grieved, Of her music thus bereaved, And the interchange once brought her Of broken fall and sleeping water. Now along the banks I roam, Soon to leave my mountain-home, And the melancholy thought Hath an inward shadow wrought, From beneath whose covert, hills, Wintry woods, and frothy rills, And the lake-like meads, appear To my spirit doubly dear, And doubly beautiful; arrayed In a vivid light and shade So strangely palpable, one might Deem the old habitual light A visionary landscape worn By the true hills, a mask now torn From the jealous face of things By the strength of sorrow. Springs Of a tender sadness, shy Of all outward sympathy, Have the truthful gaze renewed, And the keenness of the mood, Wherewith I, a stranger, first In these natural pageants nursed Inwardly the dubious strife, Whence chance and purpose drew the life Of poetry:—and from the skies And mountains, or my mental eyes, Scales seem to fall, and wondrous light Dawns, like day, while to my sight Are, like a revelation, given A sweeter Earth, a plainer Heaven! By this empty bed I mourn, Where the stream was wont to turn With a blither, louder strain Further o'er the rushy plain Its tripping waters; and I hear A voice to warn, a voice to cheer, Like a double echo, sigh Up the channel green and dry. Still within this meadow-reach Thou hast gentle lore to teach, Studious River! nor art thou Mute in thy dishonour now. But thou hast a parting word Which my soul doth well to hoard, As a monitory token Of a love so long unbroken, A serious earnest of that tie Of poetic amity, Which hath been twixt thee and me. Preach on, sweet Rothay! while I listen, And behold thy waters glisten With a sentient purpose filled, And the birch-trees banners stilled By the slumbrous frost! I hear The spirit of the river near, In the sliding shallow singing, Hark! what farewell she is bringing! Sorrow-laden I translate Her meek wisdom with a weight Of solemn language that is brought Rather from my inward thought, More abstruse than may beseem The lessons of a mountain stream, But self-disturbance hath the skill To steer the words which way it will. “By the love I have for thee, Poet! list awhile to me. From the woodlands and the hills And the icy-fettered rills Behind their masks of crystal throbbing, While the frost is hourly robbing All their fountains, from the lakes And withered fern among the brakes,— From thy favorite images Of the white snow-laden trees, And the summits hoar that seem In the wind to flash and gleam, And with silver-dusted snow To smoke like beacons, while below Upon the unwary shepherd's head Arbitrary showers are shed, Though the skies are cold and clear And no clouds are hovering near,— From the yew trees on the scar Oft inflamed by moon or star Snared within their dusky plumes, Which the radiance half consumes, Or transfigures, while the lights Climb the heavens on starry nights;— From the temple of old fir, Where the restless stockdoves stir Through the summer midnights, ranging Mid the leafless boughs, and changing All their perches hour by hour In the gently rocking tower, Like unquiet sleepers, fraught With the poison of sad thought;— From the ragged heron isles, Where the slanting sunset smiles Into the nests, and on the boughs The creatures sit in drowsy rows, With their plumage doubly bright, Slumbering in the golden light,— From the cataracts, all and each, I bring into this meadow-reach Farewells for thee; and be it mine To teach thy heart by this grave sign Of my dishonour, how to greet Those new duties thou must meet By far other streams than this, In a life of toil-worn bliss, Hallowed cares and labours pure, And in usefulness obscure Shepherding thy little flock To the shadow of the Rock Of Ages, in the desert set As a refuge from the heat, And a shelter from the eye Of dark spirits prowling nigh. Sweetly wandering from my way, Once I paused in many a bay, By a leaning oak half spanned, Or a drooping wych-elm fanned, Or at noonday clouded o'er By a nodding sycamore, While the sun fell through the eaves Of the ever-twinkling leaves, Playing through the weedy rents Of the underwater tents, By cool-rooted alder trees Pitched far down, with lattices Where light and limpid water pour And weary not hour after hour. Then was I beautiful, and then Purchased looks of love from men And praises from the poets, glad When gladness wrought in me, and sad Whensoe'er of frolic weary, I, like men, took sanctuary In opposites:—but now, in awe Of man, I swerve from that sweet law Of nature, and have thereby lost All the charms that were my boast. This then be the warning given;— While the single eye of Heaven Doth the preacher train and school With its ever-present rule, In his mouth the harshest lore Hath a secret winning power, Springing oft he knows not whence, And transcending barren sense: But should he chance before the gaze Of man to crouch, or, for the praise The world would offer, to divert The sacred stream of truth, and hurt The pastures of the little sheep He hath been ordained to keep, From his preaching will depart All that magic of the heart, All the store of simple spells Whereby faith works her miracles. Yet from this injurious wrong Of my poor stream may Christian song Cheerful wisdom thus distil;— If I do but now fulfil Half mine office to the eye Of the thoughtless wandering by, To the Angel or the Saint My disfigured type, though faint, Doth a loftier meaning bear, Than when men vouchsafed to spare All my pastoral wanderings free In their first integrity. Well it seems to forward youth, Thus to carry holy truth Here and there, as it may choose With wilful virtue, till it lose, For every praise of man it gains, Skill in truth's celestial strains. Good self-sought is barely good, And occasion too much wooed Is no angel; but a cheat Comes in disguise to counterfeit Her presence, and with fatal wiles, Self-knighted warriors thus beguiles To fearful falls; and what is beauty But too oft the foe of duty, Veiling this grave truth: Self-will Turns our very good to ill; And virtuous purpose most of all Needs the bridle and the thrall Of adverse circumstance, and place Ungenial to our special grace, Lest the unthrifty sand be done Ere yet the trial Hour is run? Yon mighty lake's sweet-watered sea, Minstrel! is my eternity; And by duty narrowed now, Straight unto that rest I flow, Well content for such an end The price to pay, full many a bend Of tuneful water to forswear And sweet delay, one only care Being left unto me—to prepare To mingle with the blessed peace, And mingling with it to increase Its blessedness, as souls perchance The rest of other souls enhance, Gently gathered, one by one, After each day's battle done. So with thee, when duty spoils Wilful grace with Christian toils, And confines in narrow bed Thy young life, be comforted. Though less lovely it may be, The road is shorter to the sea. If it gives through public strife A rougher aspect to thy life, Still the end is nearer brought, The end for which thy life hath wrought. Self only dies; the gasp of death What is it, but the earliest breath We draw on that eternal shore, Where there is life for evermore? Farewell! and when far off, O think Of spots still left on Rothay's brink Unchanged; where I with gurgling fall Am laving still the sunny wall Ivy-wimpled, and the breeze Scatters from the road-side trees Fragrant lime-flowers, and the feet Of thy familiars daily meet Between the bridges; thus, when thou Look'st o'er meads from Elton's brow, Where the fourteen yew trees bound The over-peopled church-yard round, Or from off the grassy plot Where the dwarfish cedars spot The river's brink, and six church towers In winter through the leafless bowers Look on, and mid the summer green To thee are present, though unseen, I at summer noons shall bring Broken waters there to sing, Or beneath the tall boughs shading My thin streams, be hourly braiding My long weedy locks of green, In the glossy shallow seen. Beauty, too, shall be with thee In the silver willow tree, In the unbroken dome of sky, And mighty plain which can supply A bed whereon the sun may die In glory, and the pomps of even, And the breadths of starry heaven. Grassy murmurs, too, shall wander Where the Nenna doth meander, Freighted oft with such sweet bells, Whose music o'er the lowland swells To many a farm; thou shalt not want A gentle river side to haunt, For Nenna shall thy fancy bless With her earthy silentness. Blessed is the will subdued Unto its lot, and fortitude Which so refits the local ties Once broken, and the sympathies Dissevered, that they only brighten What hath passed away, and lighten Sadness of her idle dreams; And the heart more hallowed seems, While the years new loves unfold, Superseding not the old; For kind feeling hath a truth Which outgrows not its first youth, Feeding on its native power Self-sustained; the present hour Is then most blameless when recast In the feelings of the past. Thus, while pious hopes and fears Fill in the blank thy life appears All suddenly to be, and win Without disdain a light from sin, Caution, scarcely falling short Of being a virtue, shall consort With thy new habits, and beguile Thy spirit with approving smile. Or if altered charms be slow On thy jealous heart to grow, A form on Nenna's bank shall talk With thee in many a lonely walk, An angel presence that will seem Brighter than poetic dream, An apparition that outstrips The vocal praise of minstrel's lips, Even the Spiritual Beauty Which is the Shadow cast by Duty. CLXXVII.THOUGHTS WHILE READING HISTORY. “Narratione autem historica cum præterita etiam hominum instituta narrantur, non inter humana instituta ipsa historia numeranda est; quia jam quæ transierunt, nec infecta fieri possunt, in ordine temporum habenda sunt, quorum est conditor et administrator Deus.” S. Augustine. 1.THE PRESENT. 1. Magnify not the times in which we live: The Present is a double shadow cast, Part from the Future, partly from the Past, And deeply blended is the light they give. The shadow is across our spirits thrown, We know not how much further it hath gone. The great, ennobling Past is only then A misty pageant, an unreal thing, When it is measured in the narrow ring And limit of the Present by weak men. The Future is the open trench, the ground Whereon our deeds are built, wherein we cast, As though we did a reverend temple found, The corner-stones to build another Past. 2.THE PRESENT. 2. In truth, but his must be a purblind sense, To whom the solemn days in which we live No room for awe, no scenes of rapture, give, Or of historical magnificence. When for long years have men been so intent To march through change unto one steady scope, With hearts to dream, and energy of hope To force their dreams upon accomplishment? Yet, if there be no other grandeur here, Each Present hath a stirring shadow near, A magnifying halo o'er it cast,— The thought that this same strife of good and ill, Which we have helped with individual will, By time transferred, shall be our children's Past. 3.USE OF THE PAST. There is no bent of mind so vile, so weak, As that which on the glorious Past doth set In currents of inordinate regret; And with a sphere of dreams content, doth wreak Itself upon the love of beauty, raw, And not by lowly heart and patient thought To act or inward disposition wrought, Nor made obedient to the manly law Of diligent love, whereby men would recast For their own times the greatness of the past. But he, who to that temple shall intrude For purpose less beneficent than this, Shall be outlawed unto the barren bliss Of lifelong intellectual solitude. 4.CHIVALRY. They built a bridge, and bade the church supply The scaffolding, while they the keystone brought Of Honour most elaborately wrought, And hailed the new device with jubilant cry. Thenceforth could men in meek and quiet ways Pass o'er the rudeness of those difficult days. Bolder the arch had seemed, but that within The Church had left her scaffold undisplaced; And to that age the edifice was graced By such memorial of its origin. But times came on, to whose fastidious mind That framework seemed uncouth; and to the ground Went arch and scaffold:—so was Honour found Too weak to bear the tread of human-kind. 5.ROMAN INFLUENCES. Wading amid a sea of wind-stirred bloom Of some bright crimson heath-plant, there I found Upon a mountain pass in Noricum, Engulfed, one half in verdure, in the ground The other, a grey milestone of old Rome. Such admonitions in strange sort abound, Aliens, mid those romantic forms that stir Across the days of that chivalric past,— Relics whereby Rome's spirit hath recast And mastered their original character. For her abiding influence yet indents The face of things; her very wrecks fulfil An office; earth wears some expression still Of pagan Rome on her mute lineaments. 6.CHIVALROUS TIMES. 1. Beautiful times! times past! when men were not The smooth and formal things they are to-day, When the world, travelling an uneven way, Encountered greater truths in every lot, And individual minds had power to force An epoch, and divert its vassal course. Beautiful times! times past! in whose deep art, As in a field by angels furrowed, lay The seeds of heavenly beauty, set apart For altar-flowers and ritual display. Beautiful times! from whose calm bosom sprung Abbeys and chantries, and a very host Of quiet places upon every coast, Where Christ was served, and blessed Mary sung. 7.CHIVALROUS TIMES. 2. Unlovely times! times past! when it was thought That peer and peasant were of different earth; When it was not believed that God had wrought In both one human heart of equal worth, One equal heart, which by the Saviour's Birth And Passion, at the selfsame price was bought. Unlovely times! times past! within whose womb Rapine and pride and the unmanly jar Of local feuds are ever heard at war, Like midnight sounds within a bad man's tomb. Unlovely times! when the sweet summer breeze, A merry traveller wending through the land, Found no fair farms and lonesome cottages, Whose casements he might stir with his soft hand. 8.CHIVALROUS TIMES. 3. Oh! if ye would not have your spirits shorn Of the deep consolations of the past, Or drop the links, wherewith ye can make fast The Present to the Bygone, think no scorn Of those great times whose double aspect seems Like the revolving phases of our dreams. Could we step back from out this present stir Of good and ill, which interpenetrate In every land and age the social state, How dread would seem its twofold character! So we revere the past, when time hath furled The skirts of mist, and to our vision cleared, In luminous distinction, all unsphered, The adverse circles of the Church and World. 9.BELGIAN TOWNS. 1. Was it in many hearts at once, or one— What was the land, the place, the cause, the hour, When it first dawned in men, that there is power In Numbers, that the healthy streams which run In poor men's veins are red like other blood? O blissful dawn! the thoughtful and the good Do thee glad homage in these antique haunts, Where from ten thousand wills a Popular State Sprang like an arrow from a bow, elate Beneath the pressure of degrading wants. Here, in this street of Ghent, where evening smiles, The Church and Freedom seem but one great name, And surely they so deemed who reared these piles, As knowing whence and how their freedom came. 10.BELGIAN TOWNS. 2. Hail to the land of sumptuous abbeys, built By royal-hearted burghers! Feudal keeps And tourney rings, where highest blood was spilt, I pass, yet my unkindled spirit sleeps. But all my powers with deepest reverence stir, At wrong and suffering, and the trampling down Of hill and dale, broad land and merry town, Beneath a kingly heel or knightly spur. See! from the fettered people's hungry heart, With tossing heat, and many an uncouth start, Indignant patience is inspired to draw, As from a holy womb, that wondrous birth, That truest regal thing upon the earth, The unimpassioned Sovereignty of Law! 11.BELGIAN TOWNS. 3. Law do I worship as a sovereign thing, The rich man's lord, the poor man's vassal, here In this dim street, where the town-hall doth fling Quaint shadows on the grass-grown pavement near. And can the scene around no depths unfold, Gable and arch, bay-window, woodwork old? Do not the forms grotesque in silence wait Upon the wise man's eye, themselves intent To be the symbols of a Popular State, Interpreting its fashion, growth, and bent? The streets claim kindred with each other; skills Of diverse trades and ages blend to be One lucid type of that strong harmony, Engendered of a thousand warring wills. 12.THE CRUSADES. In the long discipline of earth, not least We note how Europe, in those ages past, The burden of her martial spirit cast, With wise exorcism, far into the east; And many a noble kingdom, self-relieved, Joyed in new joys, o'er holier sorrows grieved. Then localized affections grew unharmed, And home was felt, and sympathy, before Unknown, ascended to embrace the poor,— Meek wisdom learned by Europe thus disarmed. In this sweet respiration after strife, So ruled by Heaven, men's hearts began to draw To peace, the blissful order of calm law, And hallowing restraints of private life. 13.OUR LADY IN THE MIDDLE AGES. I looked upon the earth: it was a floor For noisy pageant and rude bravery,— Wassail, and arms, and chase, among the high, And burning hearts uncheered among the poor, And gentleness from every land withdrew. Methought that beds of whitest lilies grew All suddenly upon the earth, in bowers; And gentleness, that wandered like a wind, And nowhere could meet sanctuary find, Passed like a dewy breath into the flowers. Earth heeded not; she still was tributary To kings and knights, and man's heart well-nigh failed; Then were the natural charities exhaled Afresh from out the blessed love of Mary. 14.THE POOR IN THE MIDDLE AGES. 1. It is the Past ye worship; ye do well,— If the sweet dues of reverence which ye pay Be equally disposed, nor lean one way For lack of balance in your thoughts. To spell The past in its significance, to ponder, In the embrace of judgment, fear and love In the disguises of those days, should move More than the weak idolatry of wonder, Or beauty-stricken eye; they should grow part Of the outgoings of your daily heart. And be not scared by show of kings and knights, As if those times were in such gauds embraced; Remember that the people claim a past, And that the Poor of Christ have lineal rights. 15.THE POOR IN THE MIDDLE AGES. 2. They, in whose hearts those mighty times have wrought Most deeply, have upon their aspect gazed As on an éclipse, with their eye upraised Through the subduing mean of sombre thought. And then it is a very fearful vision To see the uncounted poor, who strayed forlorn With wrongs unrighted, and with natures worn To heartlessness through every day collision With arrogance and wrong. Proud knights, fair dames, And all the pomp of old chivalric names, Fade, like a mimic show, from off the past; And to the Christian's eye ungathered flowers Of suffering meekly borne, in lowliest bowers, With solemn life fill in the populous waste. 16.THE PAPACY. That such a Power should live and breathe, doth seem A thought from which men fain would be relieved, A grandeur not to be endured, a dream Darkening the soul, though it be unbelieved. August conception! far above king, law, Or popular right; how calmly dost thou draw Under thine awful shadow mortal pain, And joy not mortal! Witness of a need Deep laid in man, and therefore pierced in vain, As though thou wert no form that thou shouldst bleed! While such a power there lives in old man's shape, Such and so dread, should not his mighty will And supernatural presence, godlike, fill The air we breathe, and leave us no escape? 17.PETRARCH AND LUTHER AT ROME. Mysterious Rome! thy very ills are fraught With somewhat of thy fearful destiny, So that the vision of thy sins hath wrought, Even like a curse, within the passer-by. Here gazed of old, with no religious eye, Petrarch the worldling; here the apostate monk Came ere his fall; and when they saw how nigh Good lay to evil, their base spirits shrunk, As from a touch-stone which could bring to light Unworthy natures that must walk by sight Through lack of trust:—and thus are sceptics made, By that half-faith which seeks for good unbound From ill; and hearts are daily wanting found, Upon the balance of that problem weighed. 18.THE HUMILIATION OF HENRY IV. AT CANOSSA. It is a thing to be much dwelt upon, And mastered in its length and breadth of thought, That this strange deed hath verily been wrought Before the face of men in times bygone,— That in one place, and at one solemn hour, The passing shadow of eternal power, In momentary transit, deeply fell On all the pride and pageant of the world Within one person for that crisis furled, To be eclipsed by things invisible. Men brooked the admonition, and they gazed Like seers inspired, while in their souls they felt That he who stooped was by submission raised Near to the height of that to which he knelt. 19.RIENZI AT AVIGNON. Throughout the earth there is a kindred dream Moored alongside of each reality, A greatness, prayed for, and yet ne'er to be, Save as the shadow lying by the beam. Yet earth is rich in grandeur unfulfilled: Thereof comes hope, whereby hot hearts are stilled; And in that dream, as in a waking trance, Great spirits walk, and by serenest law From shadows unexplored they daily draw The strength in which they battle with mischance. Rienzi in the papal tower doth lie; His Livy and his Bible near him rest, And in those symbols tangibly compressed, Were Cola's dream and his reality. 20.ORDEALS. Faith owns the rude magnificence of thought, Wherewith those venturous ages, in the dearth Of homage due to law, as umpire brought The Hand of Heaven to show the right on earth, And so for God's interposition pined, That they, in weal or woe, were quick to find Foot-prints of marvel. Better to make sure Of earth in Heaven, by training love and awe To supernatural heights, than so to draw Our Heaven within this maze of life obscure. Yet oh! how far beneath both moods are we, Who from our place of exile fain would strike, As an intrusive Presence we dislike, The sweet forebodings of eternity! CLXXVIII.PRINCE AMADIS. A BIOGRAPHY. I Prince Amadis lay in a flowery brake, By the side of Locarno's silver lake: It seems a very long while ago, Or else it may be that time goes slow. II Those were the days when the world of spirit Filled the old earth to the brim, or near it; And marvels were wrought by wizard elves, Which happen but rarely among ourselves. III The heart of Prince Amadis did not pant With an indwelling love, or blameless want Of chivalrous friendship, or thirst of power; His youth was enough for its own bright hour. IV He floated o'er life like a noon-tide breeze, Or cradled vapor on sunny seas, Or an exquisite cloud, in light arrayed, Which sails through the sky and can throw no shade. V Wishes he had, but no hopes and no fears; He smiled, but his smiles were not gendered of tears: Like a beautiful mute he played his part, Too happy by far in his own young heart! VI His twentieth summer was well nigh past, Each was more golden and gay than the last; The glory of earth, which to others grows dim, Through his unclouded years glittered fresher to him. VII And oh how he loved! From the hour of his birth, He was gentle to all the bright insects of earth; He sate by the green gilded lizards for hours, And laughed, for pure love, at the shoals of pied flowers. VIII As he walked through the woods in the cool of the day, He stooped to each blossom that grew by the way; He tapped at the rind of the old cedar trees, When its weak breath had sweetened the evening breeze. IX He knew all the huge oaks, the wide forest's gems, By their lightning-cleft branches or sisterly stems; He knew the crowned pines where the starlight is best, And the likeliest banks where the moon would rest. X He studied with joy the old mossy walls, And probed with his finger their cavernous halls, Where the wren builds her nest, and the lady-bird slumbers, While winter his short months of icy wind numbers. XI All things were holy and dear to his mind, All things,—except the hot heart of his kind, And that seemed a flower in a withered hood, Which the cold spring cankered within the bud. XII The wrongs of the peasant, the woes of the peer, Ne'er wrung from the prince a true sigh or a tear; The strife of his fellows seemed heartlessly bright, Like the laurels in winter in cold moonlight. XIII He cared for no sympathy, living in throngs Of his own sunny thoughts, and his mute inward songs; And if in the sunset his spirit was weary, Sleep was hard by him, young health's sanctuary. XIV 'Twould not have been so had he e'er known his mother, Or had had, save the green earth, a playmate and brother; For deep in his heart a most wonderful power Of loving lay hid, like an unopened flower. XV Ah! luckless it is when a spirit is haunted By all kindly powers, but attractions are wanted, Life's outward attractions, by calm, pensive law Love, sorrow, and pity, from shy hearts to draw! XVI Yet mid all the natural forms of delight, Whose footfalls stole round him by day or by night, He was pure as the white lily's dew-beaded cup, Which, bold because stainless, to heaven looks up. XVII His mind was a fair desert temple of beauty, Unshaded by sorrow, unhallowed by duty; A dream in a garden, a midsummer bliss Was the youth, the bright youth, of Prince Amadis. XVIII Prince Amadis lay in the chestnut shade Where the flickering light through the green leaves played, And the summer lake, with its blue heart throbbing, Chafed the white sand with a reedy sobbing. XIX He saw not the hills through his half-closed eye, But their presence was felt like a spirit nigh; To the spell of the noon-tide he gave himself up, And his heart overflowed like wine in a cup. XX He smiled at the silence that stole o'er the day, While the singing birds slumbered upon the spray, Till moss-scented airs o'er the green sward did creep, And tremulous mallow-leaves fanned him asleep. XXI And dreams whispered to him, the tongues of sweet flowers, Striking the chimes of the uncounted hours; And, as though he were sinless, the wood-haunting creatures Bent o'er the sleeper with love in their features. XXII Sleeping or waking, his vision was one,— That the knots of the world might by him be undone, That the Natures below and the Spirits above Might with man be confused in one Eden of love. XXIII Beautiful dreamer! how far hadst thou strayed From the love at thy doors by the pensive earth laid, And the household chains of our true love rent, Which were forged for the soul's enfranchisement! XXIV The day drifted out, like the ebb of the ocean, From the havens of earth with a quiet motion; And a cool flapping breeze grew out of the air, Which the mallow-leaves fanned to the sleeper there. XXV Prince Amadis rose from the flowery brake, While, imaged serenely down in the lake, The roseate sky, with gold bars freaked, By a flight of wild swans was duskily streaked. XXVI In a stiff-bending line through the rich sunset They wavered like cloud-spots of glossy jet, And with rude piping they marshalled their rear In a phalanx above the tranquil mere. XXVII There for one moment their huge wings they shake, Then in wide spiral circuits drop down to the lake; The dark water gurgles, thus suddenly cloven, In wakes of white bubbles interwoven. XXVIII Are there deep instincts that lurk below In those dipping breasts of driven snow? Or why do they steer their conscious way To the Prince in the mallow-curtained bay? XXIX A pale-feathered cygnet was with them, and he Swam centre of all the company, And round him they anchored in that calm pool, A vision solemn and beautiful. XXX He wore on his head a black diadem, Looped to a clasp of orange gem; His plumage gleamed in the dusk star-bright, Of purple but faintly muffled with white. XXXI There needed no voices: Prince Amadis read A dream in that show interpreted; He strode the fair cygnet, and rose from the ground With those wild white swans on a voyage bound. XXXII Young prince! they will search for thee all through the night, And the lake and the bush will gleam wan with torchlight; And there will be weeping and wailing then, If monarchs have hearts like other men. XXXIII But away and away in the midnight blue That fleet of white creatures went steering through; And away and away through the sweet day-break, From the white Alps flashed, their road they take: XXXIV Through the tingling noon and the evening vapor, Which Hesper lights with his little taper, Through the tremulous smiles of moonlight mirth, And the balmy descents of dew to the earth, XXXV Through the calms, through the winds, when the hailstones ring, The convoy passed with untiring wing, And oft from their course for hours they drove, As though they winnowed the air for love. XXXVI And now they would mount and now they would stoop, And almost to earth or river droop, And harshly would pipe through the sheer delight Of their boisterous wings, and their strength of flight. XXXVII They saw the young Save in the next night's moon, They were over Belgrade by the afternoon, And ere the sun set their journey was o'er On a willow-isle by the Danube's shore. XXXVIII They left the young prince, (for their mission was done,) There on the green willow-island alone; And, in their hoarse language they bade him farewell, And swept o'er the sun-bleached Bulgarian fell. XXXIX More and more sadly as daylight died, The breeze-troubled marsh-plants sobbed and sighed, And the pulse of the river with panting sound Beat in the swamps and the hollows round. XL But the stream travelled on like a pilgrim weary In search of his eastern sanctuary, Through the heart of old Europe guiding his floods From beneath the green boughs of the Freybourg woods. XLI The lone swampy island lay down in the river, Whose strong nervous waves made the ground and trees quiver; It swung with its head up the stream, anchored lightly By the tree roots and marsh-plants that just held it tightly. XLII It trembles for ever as the ruffled stream rushes, And the mud-bubbles splutter and quake in the bushes; Nay, it seemed in the twilight to float by the marge, Uneasily slow, like a half-sunken barge. XLIII He looked to the shore,—faded herbage, wild swamp, One ruined old mosque, all begreened with the damp; The willows leaned over in half-fallen ranks, And the cold river gurgled under the banks. XLIV The moon could scarce rise, and she rose all of blood, And with lurid reflection bedabbled the flood; And the night-wind fled frightenedly past with a wail, As if some deed of murder had freighted the gale. XLV Then when the wind had passed on out of hearing, Came an audible hush, as if spirits were nearing The lone willow-island, and made the Prince shiver, And long to seek rest in that black rushing river. XLVI Then straightway wild music played over the scene, The moon became white, and the earth moonlit green, And the breaths from the mosses like incense rose up, And each still open flower caught the dew in its cup. XLVII What is it? the features of earth seem uncommon; His heart glows with thoughts that are wilder than human; And surely that music, those waves of bright light, Are more than the charm of a beautiful night. XLVIII He felt the strange wail of the music dissolving The life that was in him, and new life evolving; His innermost being turned fluent, and fled, As if magnets were drawing it out of its bed. XLIX He saw it go forth in thin streams of gray light, Which was greedily drunk by the darkness of night; For a moment he seemed to flow out upon nature, Without personality, substance, or feature. L Then back came his life like a tide-wave sublime; It had circled the world in that moment of time. But what was it like? Was it matter, or spirit? Should he welcome it, love it? or shun it, and fear it? LI He felt all at once viewless arms were around him; Flesh and blood had no sinews like those that now bound him; He felt hands within him,—then all things gave way, His soul lay down and fluttered in extatic dismay. LII His heart turned to stone; a strange panic had chilled him; His old life died out, as this new terror filled him; He felt as if through some ordeal he was winning His way to some grand but terrific beginning. LIII He was colder than ice, with an inward cold pain, And his blood left his heart, and encircled his brain; Man's life was unmade in him, crossed by new sections, With mind for a centre instead of affections. LIV We are plants, we are beasts, we are metals, and earth, And the life of the stars too went in us at birth; We are all things in one thing, life's manifold flame Chaos gave us, when out of its bosom we came. LV So now in Prince Amadis, down in his being, The plant to the plant-life was evermore fleeing, The beasts to the beast-life; star, metal, and gem Paired off with the inner life suited to them. LVI And now they flowed into him, now they flowed out, And mingled and circled and wavered about; One life now repelled, now invited another, But the pulses that beat in them answered each other. LVII New unity too did his nature discover; He had but one sense, he was eye-sight all over: He saw tastes, he saw touches, strange mortal was he! He saw sounds, he saw scents,—he did nothing but see! LVIII He had sympathies too, but not after man's fashion; He loved, but his love was a cold shiny passion: Father-love, sister-love, all were effaced, And all his old home-idols rudely displaced. LIX In spite of himself his whole being must hasten Its affections on wholly new objects to fasten; He must speak a new language which nature will teach, But a many-tongued silentness now must be speech. LX Darkness was to him what sorrow had been, And light was his joy, with its smiles of white sheen; And colour was pathos, and sympathy flowers, And his homes were unnumbered,—all beautiful bowers. LXI Alas! I much fear that poetic desire Had grown in his heart, like a cosmical fire; He had burned for a change, and had found the change there, And a dream had been answered as if it were prayer! LXII From the deeps of the Danube there rose right before him A glorious spirit, with a light-halo o'er him, Whose heart was transparent, yet visibly heaving, With the light shining through, and yet real and living. LXIII 'Twas the essence of beauty, the spirit of earth, The Kosmos, that lurked in the marvellous birth Of the outlying universe, orbs without number, Nothingness waked from its unmeaning slumber. LXIV O who shall define this strange life of the world, That for ever unfurls all the things that are furled, A power unfatigued, and a life ever vernal, Immaterial matter, and almost eternal. LXV Like angel he seemed, with a look on his feature Of a human sort, dashed with the lowlier creatures, And he seemed at each winnow to shake from his wings The splendour of all terrestrial things. LXVI He spoke,—what a voice of most musical sweetness, Like streams in their flowing, like winds in their fleetness! It was wildest enchantment, incredible bliss To the listening heart of the Prince Amadis. LXVII Art thou weary, he cried, of that intricate strife, Which for lack of a better sad mortals call life; Then change places with me, and deep shalt thou drink Of the fountain that springs on eternity's brink. LXVIII I will give thee my powers; thou wilt need to be brave; My far-reaching subtlety too thou shalt have; My science infused in thy spirit shall be; Thou shalt beat as the world-soul awhile, 'stead of me. LXIX Thy mind shall be filled with all sweet shapes and shows; Mute creation shall watch o'er thine equal repose; And unmoral beauty shall be to thy soul An incessant delight while the weary worlds roll. LXX Beauty shall feed thee at heaven's own portals, With an exquisite influx unknown to poor mortals; Thou shalt drink of the sunstream of light as it flows, And the sight of fair things be thy spirit's repose. LXXI Art thou weary of wills, of hearts sinful and rude, Of earth's dark and bright mixtures, and curses that brood O'er a whole stricken race, and the service they need, Where the eyes ever weep, and the hearts ever bleed? LXXII Art thou sick of distractions from self, and would fain Let thy soul walk at large in a world without pain, Where law, not caprice, shall direct every force, And the absence of sin make you free of remorse? LXXIII Lo! I am the Kosmos! such beauty is mine, Where all things in truth and in harmony shine, Where no word of command, since the first one, is spoken, Where no work is unmeaning, no decree ever broken, LXXIV Where the swerving of systems is the rising and falling Of unmeasured epochs to each other calling, Where change and variety blend without flaw, And calm and catastrophe are but one law. LXXV But, if this grand life is to go into thee, Impassible, passionless, cold, must thou be; A single stray tenderness quick would dispel The new life thou hast on, and which fits thee so well. LXXVI I cannot put from thee thy flesh-and-blood heart; I have set it alone in a corner apart;— Only see that earth's pity wake it not up again,— If thou sheddest one tear, my gift is all vain. LXXVII Magnificence cannot be meek in a creature: 'Tis a stretch that would wear out and break up his nature; To be high,—high above all our kind we must dwell; He who longs to be grand must be cruel as well. LXXVIII He spoke, and there came on the earth such a hush! He threw off from himself a scarce visible flush Of the rosiest light, that passed into the heart Of the wondering Prince, with an exquisite smart. LXXIX For a moment a mist-shadow seemed just to hover— The low stars looked through it—the moonlit stream over, Then Kosmos unsouled, earth's king dispossessed, Laid down in the bed of the Danube to rest. LXXX The stars ceased to twinkle, the moon shed no beam, There came a strange murmur all over the stream; Earth felt just the slightest vibration,—then tore Right away through cold space unconcerned as before. LXXXI For a moment the Prince in astonishment mused, Till he felt his whole being without effort diffused Thro' the unsurveyed universe, and his new wings Seemed to drop life for ever into the nature of things. LXXXII Then away, and away, and away,—from the haunts Of poor moping man, and his numberless wants, Away o'er the regions of beauty that lie Beneath and beyond the wide dome of the sky! LXXXIII Sense of power was the very first thought that possessed him, And infinite space, he expected, would rest him; So he darted aloft on the wings of the night, And in secret the soundless air closed on his flight. LXXXIV O grand was the hush of sidereal space, Mid the huge orbs that looked at him full in the face; There his mind worked in greatness, unlimited then By the shrill interruptions of frivolous men. LXXXV Majestic he traversed our own Milky Way, Tracked each winding current, and sounded each bay; Its collections of worlds are the neighbours, next door To the planet that lies on Sol's furthermost shore. LXXXVI He was lonely as poet could e'er wish to be, From all outward entanglement blessedly free As second-rate greatness could covet, whose charm Is in license that startles, and power to do harm. LXXXVII He was where the wistfullest vacancy broods O'er the great empty stars and their bright solitudes, Where space, running over, petitioned for bounds, And silence itself almost ached for sweet sounds. LXXXVIII Yet the Milky Way world is our own, and his home Was not far enough off; he must still further roam; For the sense of magnificence o'er his soul stealing Was narrowed, he felt, by some patriot feeling. LXXXIX Yes! the Milky Way world is but one step in space: It is but as France is to England, a place Scarcely foreign when seen o'er the sun-misty strait, With the wild German ocean crowding in at the gate. XC The worlds where poor man hath got nothing to do,— There are plenty of such in the neighbouring blue!— Will not meet what he wants; oh no! he must be In a world which not telescopes even can see. XCI There are plenty of such, ere we come to the end Where the actual things with the possible blend, Other oceans of blue, a conceivable place;— But it burdens my heart to imagine such space! XCII Art thou sure, gentle Prince! there is no sorrow there, No laws helping laws, no angelical care? Art thou sure that obedience and duty intrude Not at all in that viewless and far solitude? XCIII For the lonely have duties, thyself mid the rest; Like a wounded bird bleeding, the heart in thy breast Sheds remorse on the air, and unkings thee when highest, While duties undone mark the track where thou fliest. XCIV Then away, in thy striving to get clear of strife! There is nought youth loves more than an unwitnessed life. Thou art gone, out of sight amid nameless worlds fleeing, With the earth-string of conscience at work in thy being. XCV When he came to the edge of the Milky Way world Tracts of space lay before him in silence unfurled; But he winged his way o'er the blue gulfs without check To worlds far beyond, from which this looked a speck. XCVI All the systems of suns that we see in the night Dwindled down to a point, and then vanished from sight; Then came fresh sets of worlds, and more inlets of space, Old types disappearing, new forms in their place. XCVII They rose up to view, like the tall masts of ships Out at sea, when the sky-line of dark ocean dips; Worlds round him, above, and beneath him, were seen, Like woods in a mist with abysses between. XCVIII Huge nebular regions, oases of light, Strewed thickly or thinly the void infinite; Each of which in itself countless worlds can compress, As thick as the sands of the wide wilderness;— XCIX Long islands of worlds, far apart in the blue, Now so near that a bridge of great suns joins the two; Now an isthmus of orbs, now a wide continent Where the numberless worlds in a bright patch are blent:— C Worlds made, worlds preparing, worlds then and there making, And inchoate spirals their white tresses shaking, Worlds liquid, worlds solid, worlds vapour all over, Worlds with or without atmospherical cover. CI He went, horror hushing the songs in his mouth, To that drear restless universe down in the south, And he trembled to see reeling Argus so flicker, Like a torch as we wave it, now slower, now quicker. CII He had favourite tracts out in space where he toured, And, from old childish longings, he deftly explored Those dark mottled patches, once scorned as delusion, Molten light, molten darkness, in orderly fusion. CIII Creation, so deemed he, was scarcely begun, A grandeur in childhood, a race yet to run, A hymn that this moment through new space has rung, The first strophe of which has yet scarcely been sung. CIV He saw rings part from centres in flaming projection, Worlds weltering wildly towards their perfection, Where the work that was done appeared more like undoing, Contraction, explosion, dark deluge, and ruin. CV He met rays of light falling earthward, like tears, That had been on their travels thirty millions of years, Cleaving like lightning the thin purple gloom, Yet would hardly reach earth until after the Doom. CVI What is distance but nature's best poem, that sings As it lengthens its flight, throwing off from its wings The most magical softness, which veils and discloses, Bringing out, filling up, wheresoe'er it reposes. CVII It is distance which robes far and near with their tints, Excites by concealing, and heightens by hints, On earth blends green forests and indigo mountains, And above presses star-worlds tosinglelight-fountains. CVIII His home was the poet's home, space, and beyond, All the worlds knit in one world, with thought for a bond, Strong musical thought to repel and to draw, With metre for ether, and song for a law. CIX For his thoughts peopled space, or at times drew it in To itself, making all things its kith and its kin; The bleakest of nebulas gave him as much Of a home as the lake which the alp-shadows touch. CX He was not more at home, where his own Lombard sky Looks down through the chestnuts, than when he might lie On forlorn wisps of stars that with pendulous motion Writhe about over space, like the wrecks on the ocean. CXI When his boat on Locarno scarce heaved in the calm, Things around him were clothed not in more homely charm, Than the gulfs where gaunt systems in awful embrace Put forth arms made of worlds, like huge feelers, in space. CXII The universe taught him that space was less vast Than the world of his soul, which all time will outlast; And mind, more colossal than matter, can come In the world of Orion to be straitened for room. CXIII What hope for the future, he thought, when he saw Orbs condense and compress themselves, plainly by law, Worlds by millions slow gathering in dread concentration, To some marvellous oneness of undreamed creation! CXIV He watched giant systems break up, and re-form, Like nations renewed by a popular storm: It was fearful to see how they cracked, swang asunder, And closed up in new systems of order and wonder. CXV He beheld with glad terror our own Milky Way At its north and south poles self-unrivet, out-sway, And some world-groups heave anchor, like icebergs sublime, Thawed out in the lapse of unwriteable time. CXVI So the Clouds of Magellan drifted off and dipped down Towards earth, as a cloud settles over a town, Mighty realms of white worlds, their soft tremulous shining With the sunsets of earth most fraternally twining. CXVII All is change and advance, not a cyclical race; Love only survives wrecks of Time, Force, and Space; Love only shall see out of all revolution How creation shall perfect its grand constitution. CXVIII All around us is Home; the heart owns no Abroad In the lap of this beautiful Free Act of God; His Love is the instinct that pilots its Course, And His sweet Will its true Imperceptible Force. CXIX O how his heart grew with the largeness of things! His sights were all thoughts, and his thoughts were all wings; Yet one look of love from his sister were bliss More eternal, more infinite surely than this. CXX Then went he, and stood in the face of the sun, At the end of the race which that orb has to run, An invisible goal in ethereal seas, Which lies to the north of the bright Hercules. CXXI But ah! when the sun that far home hath attained, We may hope that our souls better homes will have gained, Fairer heavens above, where earth's troubles will cease, But not without winning us glory and peace. CXXII The Prince goes on hunting for beauty, nor dreams That the beauty of earth is above what it seems, That the heart is the trial of what we are worth, And the best of all heavens is made out of earth! CXXIII He watched the swift moon, when her shadow first nips The bright edge of the sun in a total eclipse; And he flew to those strange rosy thumbs that protrude From the moon-darkened rim, when the light is subdued. CXXIV He went near the sun to see comets unbind Their long lucent ringlets now flowing behind, And saw the scared things, as they looked in the glass, Ruffle back their light tresses the moment they pass. CXXV Near the grand double stars he would watch with delight The beautiful quarrel between day and night, Blue sunset, red sunrise, both striving together, Weird landscapes, weird foliage, and the weirdest of weather. CXXVI He loved to see planets in sweet occultation Pass under the moon, while the double vibration, Like an echo of light, makes the planet start back, As if frightened to let the moon ride o'er its track. CXXVII He watched Jupiter's moon jumping back in alarm, Keeping step with its mother, who put forth her arm, And drew the young child with herself into night, Herself more to blame than the poor satellite! CXXVIII Then right in the flames of the sun would he go, Where an unconsumed planet lies dazzling and low, Deeper down in the sunshine than Hermes, all drowned To mortal research in the light-floods around. CXXIX He trod the outskirts of the last solar seas, Where the cold is not measured by human degrees, Where the orbs seem uncertain on what line to venture, Lest the sun might not prove their legitimate centre,— CXXX Far out in the dreary cold, far, far away, Beyond Neptune, where outlying planets obey, Reluctant and sluggish, the suck of the sun, But who drag in their orbits rather than run. CXXXI Then for change would he seek the least jewels of night, The gardens of crystal that swing into sight Every year, 'twixt the lines on which Jupiter rolls, And Mars with the white cap of snow on his poles. CXXXII He saw little earth hold its atmosphere down, While space-matter strove the poor orb to uncrown; Outside its crisp top he hung poised in the sky To see with what fleetness the planet flew by. CXXXIII In all the wide worlds, great and little, he saw, With sweet re-assurance one beautiful law,— That each world to itself its own centre should seem, An honest untruth, a self-realized dream. CXXXIV He saw that the people's large language was better Than the phrases of science, and for common use meeter; For thus all the orbs, through the vastness that roam, Feel themselves in each nook of creation at home. CXXXV For what is each heart, wheresoe'er it may live, But the centre of all the love God has to give, As dear to its Father, whatever its station, As if it by itself were the whole of creation? CXXXVI O Prince! hast thou not in thy heart some misgiving Of the centreless life that thy selfwill is living? For where self is the centre, all life is abroad, Unrooted in home, and unfastened to God. CXXXVII O good for the soul is the merciful strain Of a grave obligation; still better the pain Of repentance, whose tears are professions of faith In the God who forgives, in the life after death. CXXXVIII Then wander no longer, thou sunshiny cloud! With thy shadow just dappling the fields on thy road; Weep away to the earth in soft rain, and the shower Shall at least make one green spot more green than before. CXXXIX Life that lives for itself in an unrooted youth Must one day do penance for all its untruth, Must revenge on itself what it slighted before, In old age cast away on a desolate shore. CXL There are plants in the woods of Brazil, parasites, Who give out their fragrances only at nights, Fresh rooted each moment in wandering airs, Which are solid enough for such thin roots as theirs. CXLI Even such is thy round in this beautiful ring, An air-rooted, windshaken, unlife-like thing, Perfuming for no one night's untrodden bowers, With no holier pain than a headache of flowers. CXLII When could others awaken fond youth from a dream? It must wake of itself: for it flows like a stream,— It is gone while we speak, its swift currents unbinding; Its home is in seeking, its exile in finding! CXLIII In love have we spoken; for this Prince is our brother; But one beauty reminds him far off of another, And, ere we had time our advice to rehearse, Twice or thrice has he gone round the whole universe. CXLIV O see how he wheels up aloft in the air! Heavy wisdom from earth cannot reach to him there; Now he drops, but it is in the thick of yon wood, Where precipitous rocks overhang the dark flood. CXLV There again! he has left us in lightning-like flight, And is hidden far up in the whiteness of light, Whence faint sparkles fall like a rocket-shower breaking, Where from pinions unseen the soft motes he is shaking. CXLVI Then down the blue waters of islandless ocean He dives, like the gale, with exulting emotion, Now passively floats as the frolic wind blows him, Now tunnels the crests of cold brine that oppose him. CXLVII When he teases the earth in his low-drooping flight It is not home draws him, he will not alight; He but skims, like a swallow, in swift mazy rings, And feeds, like the bird, on invisible things. CXLVIII When he hovers o'er earth it is only to sing, Beating time for himself with his vibrating wing; While the hot spell is on him perforce must he roam, For an uneasy heart is most homeless at home. CXLIX He has thoughts, so he thinks, above all thoughts of ours, Inconceivable echoes from heavenly bowers; He has words, so he says, which we always mistake, And a silence of song which we rude mortals break. CL Ah! little he deems how much deeper a thing Is the action of life, a more bountiful spring Of beauty, of wonder, of truth, and of power, A joy more long-lived, a more heavenly dower. CLI Tears shed for others are waters that rise To their levels above in the grace-giving skies: Time wasted for others is paid back at last, Counted out in eternities, future and past. CLII Though thy life may be fretful and swift, yet delay To soothe the least sorrow that comes in thy way; For sympathy, happily choosing its times, Cheers the long nights of grief with its beautiful chimes. CLIII More tall than the stars is the wonderful height Of unselfishness, always reposing in light, On whose glorious summits the night falleth never, But the seen Face of God is its sunrise for ever. CLIV How great is the gift to have sisters and brothers! They only who lose them can estimate mothers! For to hearts, where the world would fain fling its first spell, A home can be almost religion as well. CLV Souls only sell dear in the markets of heaven, And on earth for hearts only high prices are given: Men who love while they suffer, and work while they grieve, Heaven and earth in their one web of life interweave. CLVI They only who love, and love meekly, are blest; And true love is nothing but self dispossessed; They only who labour at last win the prize; They only who sorrow can ever be wise. CLVII All these beauties are toys to thee, Prince Amadis! Thy chase is not life; it was ne'er meant for this. A schoolboy at play will outweigh thy worth soon, If he gives and takes kindly one whole afternoon. CLVIII Hast thou got any purse in the which thou canst treasure The fine glowing sunsets that give thee such pleasure? Do the angels in heaven hoard the scents of the flowers, Or photograph all the fair lights of the hours? CLIX The secrets of children, who whisper and chatter, Are worth half a score of the secrets of matter, Unless they can make us still more the world's master, To sail our ships safer, or go our way faster. CLX If too much is made of them, earth, sun, and moon Are but sights at a theatre, songs out of tune; And the round stars are only like hoops up on high, Which child-poets trundle though infinite sky. CLXI O man is the beauty, and hearts are the glory Of all the world's science and all the world's story; And sorrow is softness, a heavenly birth, To prevent our becoming as hard as the earth. CLXII These far worlds astonish the mind out of breath, So vastly outstretched in magnificent death; But grandeur wants something more changeful to rest it; It aches when one vision a long while hath pressed it. CLXIII Homely earth, solar system, Milky Way all around us, Worlds beyond the horizon with which weak science bounds us,— In and out of all these will he fitfully wander, In his speed blending strangely the Here and the Yonder. CLXIV Of all changing things far the loveliest is life, And with that, of all places, the earth is most rife; For awhile then at least will the Prince now descend, And exhaust all the beauty of earth to its end. CLXV But earth is so beautiful, he who is greedy May take all he wants, and leave more to the needy; For its lights and its shadows are fair to excess, But its fairness is least of its happiness! CLXVI Where the red Aurora wavily quivers, He saw winter arrest the Siberian rivers, And the glaciers bear on their patient backs Huge boulders, and move in their slow stiff tracks. CLXVII He saw open sea round the silent pole, Neath the arctic moon watched the waters roll, Felt the earth nod with a rocking motion, Like a ship at anchor on the ocean. CLXVIII From the leaning top of the world's north tower He gazed entranced for many an hour, Looked out into space, and wished there were bars To hinder his leaping among the stars. CLXIX Then he went over lakes that so deeply lie The sun has to drink their waters dry, Where the rivers of central Asia flow, By the steppes which the salt-rime powders with snow. CLXX He dwelt with delight for many a day Mid the fabulous trees of the Himalay, Where earth comes nearest to heaven, more near Than the Andes come with their burning spear. CLXXI The bountiful life of the jungles was his, Its grand vegetation, its animal bliss; The day-life, the night-life of forests he knew, And the monster-life of the waters blue. CLXXII He floated down Chinese rivers that lie Above the champaign threateningly; He slumbered mid opiate spices in bays Near the pirate barks of the vile Malays. CLXXIII O sweet were the trees! O wild was the scene, In the centre of Africa peopled and green, With beautiful rivers that shun the sea, And die in the sands without agony. CLXXIV The heart of Australia was known to him, And the Southern Pole with its coast-line dim, With its tall volcanoes that ruddily glare Over deserts of snow in the silent air, CLXXV Where the icebergs flash and grow dark again, And black crevices streak the horrible plain, Where the fiery reflection flickers and pants In caves where not even the white bear haunts. CLXXVI He swung in the air o'er the hanging wash Of the two worlds of waters that fearfully clash Round the Horn, where the grim cape with passionate soul Ever strains its wild eyes to behold the South Pole. CLXXVII He loved most those regions which man had least trammelled, The southern Pacific, with islands enamelled, An old world submerged, with conjectural climes Whose glory was passed ere historical times. CLXXVIII The chief lands of the planet now seem to unroll, Like a cincture with pendants, around the North Pole; Time was when the world was antarctic, but now The silent Pacific keeps that drowned world below. CLXXIX He loved the sweet dream-lands that rise to view From the soft warm deep, with their mountains of blue, With the palm groves and inlets and scent-laden bays, That lie evermore in a fairy-land haze. CLXXX He could almost have worshipped, when noon was still Mid the populous forests of green Brazil, Where incredible creepers hang from the trees Their huge-blossomed flags in the stifled breeze. CLXXXI For a while he was witched by the wind that yields Faint fragrance out of vanilla fields, And watched the pendulous humming-bird cling To the rocking flower, like a golden thing. CLXXXII In the sultry noon there were palaces cool In the weedy depths of a crystal pool, All pillared with juicy stalks, and their eaves Translucently roofed with lotus-leaves. CLXXXIII Then he would drowsily float for hours Over leagues and leagues of prairie flowers, And find in the wide horizons round Something that made his spirit bound,— CLXXXIV A dash of the Tartar-like impulse, that leaps The perilous dykes of the Asian steppes, And goes mad with the wind, and the swiftness, and stretch Of the glorious sky-line he gallops to reach. CLXXXV He has leaned his face on the desert sand To feel the hot breath of the sunburnt land; He has counted the pulses that sob in the wind, Which always seems fainting and lagging behind. CLXXXVI He found a strange magic in noxious shades, In poisonous plants, and the stilted arcades Of mangrove roots, and the cedar swamps, And the growths of the equatorial damps. CLXXXVII In the rain he watched for the sun to come out, And he shifted the ends of the rainbows about; The lightning obeyed him, and startled the night With most beautiful tempests and wild plays of light. CLXXXVIII After sunset he marked where the light of a star First struck with its thin shaft the ground from afar, And listened, if haply shrill sound it might yield, As a spear may ring on the boss of a shield. CLXXXIX When weary of colour, and dazzled with light, He thickened the darkness of palpable night; And his soul floated out of him, sweetly unbound By the measured concourse of silence and sound. CXC There were times when he hungered for sunsets, and pressed 'Gainst the motion of earth to the up-rolling west, And thus draughts of beautiful light he kept drinking, Where the sun, that he hunted, was evermore sinking. CXCI But eastward sometimes with the earth he was borne, And lived the day long in perpetual morn, Where the down-dipping rim of the planet gave way Evermore in the white light, the fountain of day. CXCII Sometimes he would hang up in space for a year, And move without toil with the huge atmosphere; Suns rose not and set not, no star shone, nor moon— He enjoyed the green blaze of a shadowless noon. CXCIII In wild hours he rushed through earth's body and seas, Up from, and down to, the antipodes, So swiftly that darkness and light flashed together, With the beauty of both, and the sameness of neither. CXCIV What a study was earth, so terrific, so tender, Such a dove-tailing process of blackness and splendour, An orb so mature, with what time had done for her, Gentle beauty, stern beauty, and beautiful horror. CXCV She told all her secrets to Prince Amadis, Of her secular ages, uninhabited bliss; She unveiled her vapour-wheels, always at play, The machinery that makes her phenomena,— CXCVI The grim whistling avalanche, rough breath of the mountains, The strange intermittance that sobs in some fountains, The tiny frost-atoms, that are stronger than thunder, Which creep into rocks and then thrust them asunder,— CXCVII The life of volcanoes, with the lava all seething, And the fire and the sulphur the fierce earth is breathing, With craters disposed round the globe in long rows Over veins of dread fire-life whose tide ebbs and flows,— CXCVIII The tortuous suck of the huge water-spout, And unorbited meteor-globes, wheeling about, The geysers, the mud-lakes, the fountains of naphtha, Earth's roof falling in through the slip of a rafter,— CXCIX The new mountain-range that yet neath the sea lingers, Just lifting among the cold waters its fingers, The mixtures, the gases, the forces, the glories, Of the subterranean laboratories. CC Now he changes the silence of pure pathless snows, For the crunching and grinding of icebergs and floes, And he watches the isotherms waver and blend With the line of the iceblink all round the world's end. CCI He revolved in the wheels of the circular gales, When they lash the deep sea with invisible flails, And was splashed by the salt foam the ocean with clangour, Like rockets of water, up-threw in its anger. CCII He found out the hearts of the wide-spreading rains, In the glens of the mountains, or wood-mantled plains; He drew the wet curtains around him in glee, And rode, like a king, in sublime privacy. CCIII He examined the laws which the snow-drifts follow, As they lie amphitheatre-wise round the hollow, As if water congealed on the uneven land Took the patterns the sea-water makes on the sand. CCIV O what beauty there was in the crystallized grains, Each with its prism, and its deftly joined veins; And he laughed at the voices of clocks and of bells, As they quaked through the drift with their querulous swells. CCV There was beauty in fogs, in their white fleecy gloom, With each nook of earth curtained off like a room, With the seemingly mist-echoed sounds that up-roll, As if from another world down in a hole. CCVI He heard the ice yawn in the still winter night, As if the frost's slumber were broken and light, And, in spite of his science, was startled at times By the firs flinging off their light loads of snow-rimes. CCVII Now he spans all at once fifty leagues of a storm, Till he comes where its outskirts a frontier may form Twixt the calm and itself, and he halts and looks through Silver windows of white mist, and beyond them the blue. CCVIII O see how yon hills fold their green arms and sleep Where the cataract faints summer-dried on the steep; Go, find out the ear of the echo, and there Rest awhile, and dream well, in the soft tingling air. CCIX Now he rouses tired nature and bids her awake, For his beauty-palled spirit hath craved an earthquake; And he races his thonghts 'gainst the shock, in his mirth, Thro' the sinuous veins of elastic old earth. CCX He knocks at the hollow of purple midnight, To see if his knocking will make it strike light, Or if the jarred planets will vibrate and quiver, As they seem to do down in the tremulous river. CCXI When he yearned for deep silence he dwelt in the moon, Where the earth looked like thirteen moons melted in one; If his eyes ached with this, earthless homes he could find In the side that looks always away from mankind. CCXII Then he dived thro' the holes in the black-spotted vest Of bright blinding matter around the sun's breast; And he might have learned lessons there,—how hearts of pride May be colder than ice, with their fire all outside. CCXIII The world was all written, without and within, With wonderful sciences, such as might win A philosopher's heart to a glorious excess Of intellectual blessedness. CCXIV No cloud rode more softly than he rode in air; He could live under water; the thin void could bear Of sidereal spaces; and such was the bliss Of the untoilsome travel of Prince Amadis. CCXV Are you hungry, Prince Amadis, hungry for kindness; Are you dazzled with matter-light, praying for blindness,— A blindness that sees a sweet twilight all round it, Earth's sorrows, earth's hopes, earth's affections that bound it. CCXVI Wilt thou come, gentle Amadis, down from thy mountain, And be bathed straightaway in the Lethe-like fountain, Where men's hearts forget all the grand world outside, And in humbling and human things cast off their pride. CCXVII The waters will be in thee fountains of tears, To brighten dim eyes, break the hard hearts of fears, And teach thee that he 'bove all poets is blest, To whom beauty is second thought, duty is best. CCXVIII Through the love of our neighbour we go to love God, Or it may be that God to our kind is the road; And of all the fair things in the broad human mind The most lovely by far is the love of our kind. CCXVII Do good to thy fellows, and thy heart shall not miss These visions of matter, fancy's riot and bliss; Thou wilt think it almost waste of time to unravel This star-moon-and-earthly confusion of travel. CCXX It is vain to upbraid him; the time is not come: He is drunken with sunshine; he will not seek home; There is no earth as yet in his heart; we must wait, And sit up for our traveller, should he be late. CCXXI It must be some outward thing only will reach To the depths of his soul, and some outward thing teach That wisdom which lies beneath thoughts, words, and years, Whose meaning is worship, whose language is tears. CCXXII He has lost his old habit of looking within; He is deafened by elements, hears not his kin, As they wail from the earth's distant surface below him, Yet fear his return, lest their hearts should not know him. CCXXIII Let him drink his wild fill of material charms: Some accident doubtless will wake sweet alarms In a nature fast losing itself, and astray; For accidents work the best wonders alway! CCXXIV It was beauty he sought and beauty he found, On the earth, in the air, and under the ground: Time was one beauty, and space was another, And a man has no griefs who is not man's brother. CCXXV He could pass through the planet diameter-wise, Where the granite arch o'er the centre lies, Through the central fires, and the voiceless wailing Of spirits there eternally ailing. CCXXVI He could circle the earth underground, Where the subterranean waters sound, In grottoes and streets which the diamond lights, And the lamps of the opal stalactites. CCXXVII On the top of the atmosphere well could he ride, Or again in the hollow equator slide, Or lie where it bulges, and midnight and noon Be cradled there by the nursing moon. CCXXVIII 'Twas a poet's life, a voluptuous calm, All music and metre, all fragrance and balm, A half-waking dream from the dawn to the even, A banquet of blossoms, a pantheist heaven! CCXXIX For ever to him jealous nature was bidden To open her gates, that he might pass unchidden To all the vast palaces God was adorning, When the stars sang together in nature's first morning. CCXXX All beauty that matter can show him shall be Unrolled to his eyes like the broad open sea; The elements too shall go with him in throngs, Singing their sweet untranslateable songs. CCXXXI He saw and he handled the powdery stuff, The insoluble atoms the world is made of; He divined how their forces, their scent, and their taste All came from the patterns in which they were placed. CCXXXII He saw how the rocky foundations of matter Were volatile, weightless, and fluent by nature; How all in swift currents was flowing and crossing, And staying with no one, and never reposing. CCXXXIII He shall rifle the universe far as it stretches, He shall look o'er the outside of space where it reaches The confines of nothing, and exhaust if he can All the beauty God made, save the grand heart of man. CCXXXIV Thus over the world for long years he was borne, To the lands of the sunset, the lands of the morn; And summer-winds fanned him wherever he went, And the soft charms of sunshine with moonlight were blent. CCXXXV Not a nook, not a hollow the whole planet over, Where he did not fresh wonder, fresh beauty discover, From the gardens of ocean the green billows under, To the lone mountain top which belongs to the condor. CCXXXVI Earth, water, air, fire, were his loves at the first; Then under-earth growths, where the metals are nursed; Then the outlines of landscapes, and mountains' grave faces, And the green things that grow in tropical places. CCXXXVII He heard the plants breathe out their soft tiny sighs, And he saw chemist air dole them out their supplies; He asked of the flowers, and they answered him right, Why some sleep with their eyes open all through the night. CCXXXVIII He enquired of the solar beam, how it enchanted The blossoms to take just the mixed hues it wanted; He watched threadlike roots pierce the clay, cleave the rock, Strong as bodkins of steel, slow as hands of a clock. CCXXXIX Sometimes he lay on a cloud, and looked down On the field and the woodland, blue sea and white town; And he thought earth's geography surely was given To be a substantial reflection of heaven. CCXL He studied the natures and instincts of beasts, And saw possible worlds imaged deep in their breasts; And he read a whole science newly-made in the features, The deep tender wildness of the faces of creatures. CCXLI He knew every chord that the rich wind could change, Its loud, and its soft, and its musical range, From the storms of the night to the songs it will sing As it sinks to an almost inaudible thing. CCXLII Sound is a language of beauty for ever, From the sigh of the reeds to the dash of the river, From the plaintive soul prisoned within the pine tree To the foam effervescing on a wave out at sea. CCXLIII The piping of wild-fowl was music to him, As it rose from the marsh, fenny, sedgy, and dim, Though it sounded sometimes, long haunting the ear, Too like human anguish, too word-like, too clear. CCXLIV Yet the shouts of the gulls to the deaf storms complaining, Their shrieks, and their oaths gainst the strong winds maintaining, Were excitement at times, in the sea-sounding air, As if the wild woes of all shipwrecks were there. CCXLV Even sounds out of harmony filled him with wonder, Like the cry of the curlew in the middle of thunder, Inopportune sounds, or sounds cursed from their birth, Like unmusical souls among men upon earth. CCXLVI There was one sound of sweetness he loved and he feared, Which full oft in the oak-groves of summer was heard; 'Twas a thing close to tears, and it made him turn pale,— The half-human soul of the grieved nightingale. CCXLVII He lay long to listen in caves, where the swell Of the sea-murmur sings, like the air in a shell, Now idyll, now elegy, storm-ode or pean, Mid the cavernous isles of the classic Egean. CCXLVIII Where the mountains were folded one over another, And the hanging woods the echoes smother, He loved the sea's voice, where its courage fails, Speaking low, like a stranger, in inland vales. CCXLIX He discovered that time made a sound in its going, A tremulous ringing, a rhythmical flowing, Slowest at noon, as if day in its net Caught the sun for a while ere he slanted to set, CCL He wrapt his soul round in each kind of perfume From the bright open gardens or close forest-gloom, And he saw how within him each fragrance was mother Of a brood of soft thoughts that was like to no other. CCLI But the sounds and the scents floated into his being, Not by hearing or smell, but a new kind of seeing, Which brought all unbodied delights within reach, And gave colour and form to the beauty of each. CCLII 'Twas the same wondrous eyesight which o'er the earth cast, Saw clear through the gauze of the Present the Past, And the Future, which under old centuries lay, Like a grave pre-existence, work up into day. CCLIII The cosmical meanings, the calmness and strife, The intermutations of earth's ancient life, He read off from her strata, strange ciphers and dread, And great thoughts sang out loud in his soul as he read. CCLIV He sings funeral hymns over buried creations, Or inaugurates epochs with grandest orations, While the rocks at his bidding re-plant, re-adorn Earth's secular landscapes ere Adam was born. CCLV The deltas all told him what history was theirs, White shells and black soil in alternate thin layers; The dunes let him feel their slow pulses, dumb things That can walk without feet and can fly without wings. CCLVI In truth it was strange and suggestive to see The patience of earth's monotony, How grand in its slowness the march of a law That must work without tool and complete without flaw. CCLVII How slowly the desert stalked into the land, And had powdered old Egypt with handfuls of sand, And how calm and contented the pyramids were To be buried so slowly by hair-breadths a year. CCLVIII He saw how old history patiently waited Her time, under green mounds still unexcavated; In unthought-of places he watched mortals treading The graves of old grandeurs, unknowing, unheeding. CCLIX In Edom and Tadmor he stayed to imbibe The spirit of ruins, but found that the tribe Of the great human race left a taint where it travelled, Making earth's peaceful spells all bewildered and ravelled. CCLX Earth showed him the footprints of ages, which she Had so tenderly veiled with green grass or blue sea, And he saw the true process of world-peopling, flowing By routes unsuspected, a science worth knowing. CCLXI Hieroglyphical marks became clear by degrees, Either crooked or straight, like the wakes on calm seas, The paths by which Asia her children had driven From her hearth to fill earth at the bidding of heaven. CCLXII He dreamed that he saw, was it more than a dream? Laws, faiths, and philosophies national seem, And that all mental glories subservient must be To the physical spells of geography. CCLXIII In the bright silver havens of cloudland above He lingered to watch how the rainbow-looms move; He heard light sing its songs in the calm upper ether, And the whispers the clouds made when touching together. CCLXIV Earth-weary he rose up again on swift wings Through the half-solid space-matter, graven with rings, The grooves of the stars in their orderly race Through the infinite purple of icy-cold space. CCLXV But his thoughts were more earthly; he lagged on the wing, As earth's sounds in his ears kept murmuring; Space appeared to resist him much more than before, As he breasted the light on its outermost shore. CCLXVI And the marvels of starry life soon became weary, And the gulfs of the Milky Way manless and dreary: How sweet looked our planet, when it first came in sight, Like a teardrop of joy on the fair brow of night. CCLXVII Ah! this foolish Prince! was the first hopeful feeling That o'er thy young lifetime already was stealing; This the true fountain deep in thee, the root Of earth's wonderful flower that bears heavenly fruit. CCLXVIII At last he was homesick; at last he was weary; At last the world's outside shone cold-bright and dreary; He had come to the end, and he saw that the light Of beauty fell short of the infinite. CCLXIX He was sick of the luscious cup nature had brought him, And began to distrust the thin truths she had taught him; At last came the time, when a soul full of beauty Should feel the one lovely thing wanting was duty. CCLXX Sad thoughts rose within him, distracting, prolific, As he sank to the earth in the Southern Pacific, On a cocoa-crowned crater, which coral worms built, And the yellow brine-lichens had modestly gilt. CCLXXI In his absence of mind, he had lighted below Near a dwelling of man, where the plaining of woe On the warm spicy wind arose touching and wild,— 'Twas a mother just closing the eyes of her child. CCLXXII First there came o'er his heart a most strange agitation,— Then it flashed on his mind like a new revelation,— No love without depth, and no depth without sorrow; For the tears of to-day are the joys of to-morrow. CCLXXIII 'Twas as old as the hills; but it is so with youth,— It must find out as new the most primary truth: No wisdom self has not found out is our own; Truths taken on trust are oft cold as a stone! CCLXXIV He thought of the creed of his now sainted mother; It taught the same lesson; it was based on no other; How the great God Himself, who all beauty had given, Came on earth to find woe when there was none in heaven. CCLXXV All at once what a change had come over his spirit; For tho' sorrow be not the whole truth, it is near it. A thousand false lights were put out on the earth, For the beauty of things seemed a poor kind of mirth. CCLXXVI It was persons, not things, that the Prince wanted now, And he welcomed the ache just begun in his brow; O beautiful sorrow! thy tears how they shine,— Ah! none can preach God with persuasion like thine! CCLXXVII All wisdom is in thee, O fairy-like sorrow! The faith of to-day, and the crown of to-morrow, The love, for God's sake, of these deep human faces, With their troubles, and joys, and their hearts' common-places. CCLXXVIII The sound of the savage in the cocoa-isle weeping Hath wakened the Prince from the sleep he was sleeping: To mourn with the sad was his first act of duty, And at once he found out the imposture of beauty. CCLXXIX He hath shed a man's tear o'er the grief of another; And lo! earth fell beneath him, and man was his brother: And a kindhearted soul, with a sad sort of bliss, In his hoary old age was the Prince Amadis!
